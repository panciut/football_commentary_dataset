Belgium 1–0 England
2018 FIFA World Cup – Group G, Kaliningrad Stadium, Kaliningrad – 28 June 2018

Belgium secured a narrow victory over England in their final group match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. With both teams already through to the knockout stage, Belgium clinched first place in Group G thanks to a decisive strike early in the second half. Adnan Januzaj scored the only goal of the game in the 51st minute, curling a shot into the net after England’s defence failed to close him down. Neither side managed a breakthrough before half-time, and chances were limited as England searched for an equaliser but were unable to convert their opportunities. Belgium’s defence remained solid, and England’s attacks lacked the cutting edge needed to level the score, leaving the match at 1–0 in favour of the Red Devils at full-time.
