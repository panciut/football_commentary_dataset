England 2–0 Germany
UEFA Euro 2020 – Round of 16, Wembley Stadium, London – 29 June 2021

England secured a memorable victory over Germany to progress to the Euro 2020 quarter-finals with goals in the second half at Wembley Stadium. The first half saw few clear chances for either side, with both defences well organised and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford making a notable save to deny Kai Havertz early in the game.

The breakthrough came in the 75th minute when Raheem Sterling finished from close range after a well-worked attacking move involving Luke Shaw and Jack Grealish, giving England the lead. England then doubled their advantage in the 86th minute. Harry Kane rose to head in Grealish’s cross, securing the win and sparking celebrations among the home crowd.

England managed possession effectively in the closing stages and limited Germany to few opportunities, with Thomas Müller missing a key chance to draw his side level.

Key events:

75′ – Raheem Sterling (England) goal.

86′ – Harry Kane (England) goal.

England’s 2–0 win ended decades of knockout frustration against Germany and booked a last-eight tie against either Sweden or Ukraine.
