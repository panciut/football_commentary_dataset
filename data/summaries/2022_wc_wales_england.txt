England closed their group-stage campaign with a convincing victory over Wales to secure first place in Group B. The first half was largely uneventful, with Wales sitting deep and England controlling possession but struggling to create clear chances. Both sides went into the interval level after a cautious opening 45 minutes.

The match turned decisively just after half-time. In the 50th minute, Marcus Rashford broke the deadlock with a powerful free kick that beat the goalkeeper at the near post. Barely a minute later, England doubled their advantage as Phil Foden finished from close range after a low cross into the box, giving England firm control of the contest.

England continued to dominate the second half, exploiting spaces as Wales tired. Rashford added his second goal in the 68th minute, driving into the area and finishing low to make it 3–0. From that point on, England managed the game comfortably, limiting Wales to few attacking opportunities and seeing out the win without difficulty.

The result confirmed England’s progression to the knockout stage as group winners, while Wales were eliminated from the tournament.
