England produced a commanding performance to secure a 5–0 away win over Latvia in their 2026 World Cup qualifying match.

England continued to dominate possession and territory, forcing Latvia onto the back foot.

England doubled their advantage in the 44th minute through Harry Kane, who finished from close range after a team move created space inside the box. Kane then added a penalty in first-half stoppage time (45+4′) after being fouled inside the area, giving England a comfortable 3–0 lead at half-time.

The second half saw England maintain intensity, and in the 58th minute a Latvian defender turned a cross into his own net under pressure, extending England’s lead to 4–0. Substitute Eberechi Eze wrapped up the scoring in the 86th minute with a composed finish after good interplay in the final third.
