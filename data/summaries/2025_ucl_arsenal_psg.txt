Arsenal 0–1 Paris Saint-Germain
2024–25 UEFA Champions League – Semi-Final (First Leg), Emirates Stadium, London – 29 April 2025

In the first leg of their Champions League semi-final, Paris Saint-Germain secured a narrow but vital 1–0 away win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. The match’s decisive moment came early: Ousmane Dembélé surged into space and finished with precision into the bottom corner in the 4th minute, giving PSG the lead and putting them in control of the tie from the outset. PSG dominated possession in the opening stages and tested Arsenal’s defence, while Arsenal gradually grew into the game as the first half progressed. Arsenal had opportunities after the break, including a Mikel Merino header that was ruled out for offside, and PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made several key saves to preserve the slender lead. The match ended 1–0 in PSG’s favour, leaving the tie finely poised ahead of the return leg in Paris.  ￼
