Germany looked set to take control in this Group E opener, dominating possession and creating several early chances, including an effort from Kai Havertz that was ruled out for offside. However, the decisive moments came later in the match.

The hosts took the lead in the 33rd minute when Ilkay Gündogan converted a penalty after a foul was awarded inside the box, giving Germany a deserved advantage at half-time.

Japan mounted a dramatic second-half comeback. In the 75th minute, Ritsu Doan equalised by finishing from close range following a swift attacking move, bringing renewed belief to the Asian side. Eight minutes later, in the 83rd minute, Takuma Asano struck the winning goal with a composed finish inside the box after sustained pressure, completing a historic turnaround and sealing a 2–1 victory for Japan.

Key events:

33′ – Ilkay Gündogan (Germany) penalty goal.

75′ – Ritsu Doan (Japan) goal.
