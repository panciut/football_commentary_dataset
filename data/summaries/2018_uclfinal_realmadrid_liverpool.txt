Real Madrid 3–1 Liverpool
2018 UEFA Champions League Final, NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium, Kyiv – 26 May 2018

Real Madrid clinched the trophy with a strong second-half showing in Kyiv. After a goalless first half, Karim Benzema opened the scoring in the 51st minute when he capitalised on a mistake by Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius, diverting the ball into the net.

Liverpool responded quickly. In the 55th minute, Sadio Mané tapped in from close range following a corner routine, levelling the match and giving the Reds a brief resurgence.

Real regained control through Gareth Bale, who entered as a substitute and scored a spectacular overhead kick in the 64th minute to restore Madrid’s lead. Bale added a second in the 83rd minute, firing a long-range strike that slipped through Karius’ hands to make it 3–1 and effectively secure the victory.

Liverpool’s star Mohamed Salah had been withdrawn earlier with a shoulder injury, which disrupted their attacking rhythm, but Mané’s effort provided the only goal for the English side.
