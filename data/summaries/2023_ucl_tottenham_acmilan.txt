Tottenham Hotspur 0–0 AC Milan
2022–23 UEFA Champions League – Round of 16 (Second Leg), Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London – 8 March 2023

Tottenham Hotspur and AC Milan played to a goalless draw in the second leg of their Round of 16 tie, a result that was enough for AC Milan to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals on a 1–0 aggregate scoreline following their first-leg win.  

The match was tight and competitive but lacked clear goalscoring opportunities for much of the 90 minutes. Tottenham struggled to break down Milan’s organised defence, which absorbed pressure and limited clear chances. Milan created a few opportunities of their own and forced multiple saves from Tottenham’s goalkeeper Fraser Forster, while Tottenham’s best moments came late in the game.  

A key moment occurred in the 77th minute when Cristian Romero was sent off for Tottenham after receiving a second yellow card, leaving Spurs with ten men and making a comeback even more difficult. In stoppage time, Tottenham thought they might snatch victory when Harry Kane’s header was saved by AC Milan keeper Mike Maignan, and a subsequent attempt by Divock Origi struck the post, but neither effort resulted in a goal.  

The 0–0 draw completed an aggregate 1–0 win for Milan and sent them into the quarter-finals, their first at this stage in the competition in over a decade. 

Key events:
	•	77′ – Cristian Romero (Tottenham) sent off (second yellow).  
	•	Late – Harry Kane (Tottenham) header saved; Divock Origi (AC Milan) hits post (Tottenham chances).  

Milan’s tactical discipline and defensive resilience secured progression despite the goalless draw.
