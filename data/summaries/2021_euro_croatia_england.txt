England 1–0 Croatia
UEFA Euro 2020 – Group D, Wembley Stadium, London – 13 June 2021

England began their Euro 2020 campaign with a narrow but significant victory over Croatia in their opening group match at Wembley, avenging their 2018 World Cup semi-final defeat to the same opponents. England dominated large portions of the first half, creating early chances and pressuring Croatia’s defence, with Phil Foden hitting the post and Kieran Trippier testing the Croatian back line before half-time.

The decisive moment came just after the hour mark. In the 57th minute, Raheem Sterling finally broke the deadlock, finishing first-time into the bottom corner after a precise through-ball from Kalvin Phillips split the Croatian defence and presented Sterling with a clear chance.

Croatia sought an equaliser in the closing stages, with midfield orchestrator Luka Modrić attempting efforts from distance and substitutes pushing forward, but England’s defensive organisation and Jordan Pickford’s composure ensured the clean sheet. England managed the final minutes effectively to hold on for the 1–0 win.

Key events:

57′ – Raheem Sterling (England) goal.

England’s victory marked their first-ever winning start at a European Championship and gave them an early advantage in Group D.
