Argentina produced a dominant performance to defeat Croatia and reach the World Cup final. The opening stages were tightly contested, with Croatia enjoying spells of possession, but Argentina grew into the match and began to create the clearer chances.

The breakthrough came in the 34th minute, when Lionel Messi converted a penalty with power and precision after being fouled in the box, giving Argentina the lead. Just five minutes later, in the 39th minute, Julián Álvarez doubled the advantage with a remarkable solo run, carrying the ball from inside his own half and finishing past the goalkeeper to put Argentina firmly in control at half-time.

Croatia attempted to respond after the break, but Argentina remained organised and dangerous on the counter-attack. The decisive third goal arrived in the 69th minute, when Messi produced a brilliant run down the right flank before cutting the ball back for Álvarez, who scored his second of the match from close range.

Argentina managed the remainder of the game comfortably, limiting Croatia’s attacking threat and seeing out a convincing 3–0 victory to book their place in the World Cup final.
