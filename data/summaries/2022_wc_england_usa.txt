England and the United States played out a scoreless draw in their second Group B match at the 2022 World Cup. The opening stages were competitive, and both sides had periods of possession, but neither defence was breached across 90 minutes.

The United States looked lively in attack at times, creating several promising transitions and set-piece situations. Their closest chance came in the 33rd minute when Christian Pulisic struck the crossbar with a powerful effort that drew a strong reaction from the crowd.

England controlled more of the ball throughout the match and sought openings through combinations involving Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, but clear opportunities were limited. In the second half, England’s best opportunity fell to Harry Kane, whose header from a free-kick delivery went narrowly over the bar in the 74th minute.

The match finished 0–0, leaving both teams unbeaten in their group and requiring positive results in their final fixtures to secure progression.
