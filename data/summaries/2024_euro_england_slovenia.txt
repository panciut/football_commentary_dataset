England 0–0 Slovenia
UEFA Euro 2024 – Group C, RheinEnergieSTADION, Cologne – 25 June 2024

England’s final group match ended in a goalless draw against Slovenia, a result that saw both sides progress from Group C, with England topping the section. The match was largely cagey, with England dominating possession and territory but struggling to convert control into clear scoring opportunities. England’s first shot on goal came around the 30th minute, but despite sustained pressure and several attempts — including efforts by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Cole Palmer — they were unable to breach Slovenia’s organised defence. Slovenia defended resolutely, absorbing England’s pressure and preventing meaningful breakthroughs while offering limited attacking threat of their own. The game concluded 0–0, with neither side finding a way past the opposing goalkeeper. (turn0search1￼)
