Athletic Club 0–2 Arsenal
2025–26 UEFA Champions League – Group Stage, San Mamés, Bilbao – 16 September 2025

Arsenal opened their 2025–26 Champions League campaign with a solid away victory at Athletic Club. The match remained goalless through much of the first half and into the early stages of the second, with both sides creating limited openings. Arsenal began to grow into the contest and ultimately took control late.

The breakthrough came in the 72nd minute when Gabriel Martinelli, introduced as a substitute, scored shortly after coming onto the pitch. He latched onto a ball over the top and finished with composure past the Athletic goalkeeper to give Arsenal the lead. Later in the match, Leandro Trossard doubled the advantage in the 87th minute, converting from close range after receiving a cut-back from Martinelli and a bit of fortune on the finish. Arsenal’s defence held firm to see out the 2–0 win.
