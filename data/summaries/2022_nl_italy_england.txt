Italy 1–0 England
2022–23 UEFA Nations League – Group A3, San Siro, Milan – 23 September 2022

Italy secured a narrow victory over England in their Nations League group match at the San Siro. The first half was cagey and goalless, with both sides creating limited clear opportunities as they probed for openings.

The deadlock was broken in the 68th minute when Giacomo Raspadori struck with a composed finish from the edge of the penalty area after collecting a long pass and creating space, giving Italy the lead. England responded by pushing forward and making attacking substitutions, with Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham testing goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, but clear chances were few and Italy’s defence remained disciplined.

England’s best opportunities in the closing stages included attempts from set pieces and close-range efforts, but they were unable to convert, and Italy held on for a 1–0 victory.
