Czech Republic 0–1 England
UEFA Euro 2020 – Group D, Wembley Stadium, London – 22 June 2021

England secured top spot in Group D with a narrow but important win over the Czech Republic at Wembley. The decisive moment came in the 12th minute, when Raheem Sterling headed in from close range following a well-delivered cross from Jack Grealish, giving England an early lead.

England dominated possession for much of the first half and carried the greater attacking intent, forcing saves and creating additional openings, but they were unable to add to their advantage before half-time.

The second half saw the Czechs improve their territory and attempt to build momentum, but England’s defensive organisation limited clear chances for the hosts. England’s substitutes helped retain control in midfield and see out the victory, ensuring a clean sheet and first place in the group.
