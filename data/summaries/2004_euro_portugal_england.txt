England took the lead in the 3rd minute when Michael Owen capitalised on a long clearance that was misjudged in the Portuguese defence, flicking the ball past Ricardo into the net.

Portugal responded with persistent pressure and eventually drew level in the 83rd minute with a header from Hélder Postiga from Simão’s cross.

Extra time saw further drama: Rui Costa put Portugal ahead in the 110th minute with a powerful shot from distance, but Frank Lampard equalised for England in the 115th minute, forcing a 2–2 finish after 120 minutes.
