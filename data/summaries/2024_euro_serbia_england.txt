Serbia 0–1 England
UEFA Euro 2024 – Group C, VELTINS-Arena, Gelsenkirchen – 16 June 2024

England opened their Euro 2024 campaign with a narrow but vital victory over Serbia. The only goal came in the 13th minute, when Jude Bellingham met a Bukayo Saka cross that was deflected into space and powered a header into the net to put the Three Lions ahead. England controlled much of the early play and created several openings, but were unable to extend their lead before half-time.  ￼

After the break, Serbia gradually increased their attacking threat and forced a handful of chances, with England’s defence and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford making key interventions to maintain the clean sheet. Harry Kane came close to scoring late on but saw a header superbly pushed onto the bar by Serbia’s goalkeeper Predrag Rajković, while Serbia’s efforts to equalise were limited to long-range attempts and blocked entries into the box.  ￼

England held firm through the final minutes to complete a 1–0 win, earning three points in their opening group game and topping Group C after this matchday.  ￼
