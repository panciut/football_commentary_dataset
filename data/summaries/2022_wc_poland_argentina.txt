Poland 0–2 Argentina
2022 FIFA World Cup – Group C, Stadium 974, Doha – 30 November 2022

Argentina secured a comfortable win over Poland to finish top of Group C. After a goalless first half in which Argentina controlled possession and tested the defence, the deadlock was broken just after the break when Alexis Mac Allister scored in the 46th minute, finishing low inside the box after a sustained Argentina attack.

Argentina continued to press and extend their lead. In the 67th minute, Julián Álvarez doubled the advantage with a powerful finish into the top corner following a well-constructed team move, putting the match beyond Poland’s reach.

Poland had earlier seen Lionel Messi miss a first-half penalty, but were unable to convert limited chances despite moments of possession. Argentina’s victory secured them top spot in the group and progression to the knockout stages.

Key events:

46′ – Alexis Mac Allister (Argentina) goal.

67′ – Julián Álvarez (Argentina) goal.
