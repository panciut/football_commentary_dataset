Morocco 0–0 Spain (Morocco win 3–0 on penalties)
2022 FIFA World Cup – Round of 16, Education City Stadium, Al Rayyan – 6 December 2022

Morocco and Spain played a tightly contested Round of 16 match that remained goalless through both regular time and extra time. Spain dominated possession for large periods, controlling the ball and attempting to break down Morocco’s organised defence, but despite superior territory they failed to create clear scoring opportunities. Morocco defended resolutely and looked dangerous on the counter, with a couple of attempts from Nayef Aguerd and other forward moves that tested Spain’s back line without resulting in goals.

After 120 minutes, the score stayed 0–0, leading to a penalty shoot-out. Morocco’s goalkeeper Yassine Bounou became the hero of the tie, saving key penalties and frustrating Spanish takers. Spain’s Pablo Sarabia, Carlos Soler and Sergio Busquets all failed to convert, while Morocco’s Abdelhamid Sabiri and Hakim Ziyech scored from the spot. Achraf Hakimi calmly chipped his penalty down the middle to seal a 3–0 shoot-out win for Morocco.

Morocco’s victory marked their first ever progression to a World Cup quarter-final, a historic achievement for the North African side, while Spain’s tournament ended in disappointment after a rare goalless performance.

Key events:

0–0 after 90 minutes – Neither side scored.

0–0 after extra time – Match remained scoreless.

Penalty shoot-out: Morocco win 3–0 (Bounou decisive, Hakimi clinches).
