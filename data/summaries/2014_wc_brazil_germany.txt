Brazil 1–7 Germany
2014 FIFA World Cup – Semi-final, Estádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte – 8 July 2014

Germany delivered one of the most remarkable performances in World Cup history, overwhelming hosts Brazil with an extraordinary first-half display. The deadlock was broken in the 11th minute, when Thomas Müller finished unmarked from a corner to give Germany an early lead.

The match swung decisively in a devastating six-minute spell. Miroslav Klose scored in the 23rd minute, becoming the all-time leading goalscorer in World Cup history, before Toni Kroos struck twice in quick succession in the 24th and 26th minutes. Sami Khedira added a fifth in the 29th minute, leaving Brazil trailing 5–0 before half an hour had been played.

Germany continued to control the match in the second half. Substitute André Schürrle scored twice, in the 69th and 79th minutes, extending the lead to 7–0. Brazil managed a late consolation goal through Oscar in the 90th minute, but the outcome was already sealed.

The result, later referred to as the Mineirazo, marked Brazil’s heaviest defeat in World Cup history and sent Germany emphatically into the final.
