Costa Rica 0–0 England
2014 FIFA World Cup – Group D, Estadio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte – 24 June 2014

Costa Rica and England played out a goalless draw in their final Group D match at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Both teams created limited clear-cut opportunities, with England pressing sporadically and Costa Rica organised in defence. England’s Daniel Sturridge had several attempts on goal but was unable to finish, while Costa Rica’s goalkeeper Keylor Navas made important saves, including tipping a Celso Borges free kick onto the crossbar. The deadlock remained unbroken through 90 minutes as neither side managed to find the net.

England made several chances, including a shot by Sturridge that narrowly missed the upright after a build-up involving Jack Wilshere and an effort by Wayne Rooney that was tipped over by Navas late in the game. Costa Rica’s defensive resilience and occasional transitions prevented England from converting pressure into a goal.
