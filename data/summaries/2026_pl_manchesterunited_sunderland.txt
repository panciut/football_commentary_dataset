Manchester United 2–0 Sunderland
Premier League, Old Trafford – 4 October 2025

Manchester United secured a 2–0 home victory over Sunderland in their Premier League fixture at Old Trafford.

United maintained control as the match developed, pressing to create further opportunities while keeping Sunderland’s attacks limited with disciplined defending.

Sunderland had a late penalty appeal overturned by VAR before the break but were unable to convert significant chances in the second half. Manchester United managed the remainder of the game effectively, securing a clean sheet and all three points.
