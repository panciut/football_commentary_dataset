Liverpool 0–1 Real Madrid
2022 UEFA Champions League Final, Stade de France, Paris – 28 May 2022

Real Madrid secured their 14th European Cup with a narrow victory over Liverpool in a tense final at the Stade de France. After an uneventful first half in which Liverpool controlled possession and created early opportunities — including a Sadio Mané shot pushed onto the post by Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and several efforts from Mohamed Salah that were comfortably saved — the deadlock remained intact going into the break.

The decisive moment arrived in the 59th minute, when Vinícius Júnior turned in a close-range finish from a driven cross across the face of goal to give Real Madrid the lead. Despite dominating the ball for large periods, Liverpool were unable to penetrate Real’s organised defence. Courtois continued to frustrate the Reds with a series of key saves later in the match as Liverpool pressed for an equaliser.

Liverpool tested Real throughout the final stages, but the La Liga champions held firm to the narrow lead until full-time. The win extended Real Madrid’s record as the most successful club in Champions League history.
