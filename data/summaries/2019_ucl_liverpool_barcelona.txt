Liverpool 4–0 Barcelona
2018–19 UEFA Champions League – Semi-Final (Second Leg), Anfield, Liverpool – 7 May 2019
Liverpool overturned a 3–0 first-leg deficit to reach the Champions League final with a remarkable comeback.

Liverpool took the lead early in the match when Divock Origi scored in the 7th minute, reacting quickly to a saved Jordan Henderson effort and finishing from close range. The early goal injected belief and set the tone for a high-intensity performance.

After a goalless first half, Liverpool continued their relentless pressure. Georginio Wijnaldum, brought on at half-time, scored twice in quick succession in the 54th and 56th minutes — first with a low drive past the goalkeeper and then with a powerful header — bringing the aggregate score level and sending the crowd into raptures.

With momentum fully in their favour, Liverpool completed the extraordinary turnaround in the 79th minute. A quickly taken corner by Trent Alexander-Arnold caught Barcelona’s defence off guard, and Origi was left unmarked to steer the ball into the net, completing his brace and sealing a historic 4–0 victory on the night.
