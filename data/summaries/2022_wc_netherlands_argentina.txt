Argentina reached the World Cup semi-finals after a dramatic and fiercely contested quarter-final against the Netherlands, ultimately prevailing on penalties after extra time. Argentina struck first in the 35th minute, when Nahuel Molina finished at close range following a precise Lionel Messi through-ball to give La Albiceleste the lead. Messi then converted a 73rd-minute penalty after a foul in the box, doubling Argentina’s advantage and putting them in control of the tie.

The Netherlands responded strongly late in the second half. In the 83rd minute, substitute Wout Weghorst headed in from a Steven Berghuis cross to reduce the deficit. With time running out, Weghorst struck again in the 90+11th minute, poking home from a rehearsed free-kick routine to level the match at 2–2 and force extra time.

Neither team could find a winner in extra time, and the tie proceeded to a penalty shoot-out. Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez was pivotal, saving two penalties, while Lautaro Martínez converted the decisive spot-kick to secure Argentina’s 4–3 shoot-out victory and a place in the last four.
