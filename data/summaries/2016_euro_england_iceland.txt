England 1–2 Iceland
UEFA Euro 2016 – Round of 16, Allianz Riviera, Nice – 27 June 2016

England were eliminated from Euro 2016 after a shock defeat to Iceland in the round of 16. England made a strong start and took the lead in the 4th minute, when Wayne Rooney converted a penalty after Raheem Sterling was fouled in the area.

Iceland responded almost immediately. In the 6th minute, Ragnar Sigurðsson equalised with a powerful close-range finish following a long throw into the box, exposing England’s defensive organisation. Iceland then completed the turnaround in the 18th minute, when Kolbeinn Sigþórsson scored through goalkeeper Joe Hart after a low shot found its way into the net.

England dominated possession for much of the remainder of the match but struggled to create clear chances against Iceland’s compact and disciplined defence. Despite sustained pressure and several crosses into the box, England failed to find an equaliser, with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Halldórsson making key saves to preserve the lead.

The match ended 2–1, marking one of the biggest upsets in European Championship history and bringing an abrupt end to England’s tournament.
