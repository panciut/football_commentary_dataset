Italy 1–1 England (Italy win 3–2 on penalties)
UEFA Euro 2020 Final, Wembley Stadium, London – 11 July 2021

England took a dream start in the final, with Luke Shaw scoring in the 2nd minute — the fastest goal ever in a European Championship final — turning in a crisp left-footed finish from a precise cross to give the hosts an early lead.

Italy gradually grew into the match and drew level in the 67th minute when Leonardo Bonucci reacted quickly in the box to stab home after sustained pressure and a loose ball, cancelling England’s advantage and setting up a tense finish.

After 90 minutes plus extra time, the score remained 1–1, and the title was decided by a penalty shoot-out. England converted their first two efforts, but Marcus Rashford struck the post, Jadon Sancho saw his attempt saved, and Bukayo Saka’s decisive kick was also stopped by Gianluigi Donnarumma, giving Italy a 3–2 shoot-out win.
