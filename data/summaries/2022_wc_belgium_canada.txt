Belgium 1–0 Canada
2022 FIFA World Cup – Group F, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan – 23 November 2022

Belgium secured a narrow victory over Canada in their opening match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Canada began the game with energy and nearly took the lead early when Alphonso Davies was awarded a penalty in the 10th minute, but his spot-kick was saved by Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, keeping the scores level in a cagey opening period.

Despite Canada’s strong start and territorial pressure — including numerous attempts from outside the box — Belgium grew into the match and struck just before half-time. In the 44th minute, Michy Batshuayi connected with a driven pass from Toby Alderweireld and finished low past the Canadian goalkeeper to give Belgium the lead.

In the second half, Canada continued to press for an equaliser, generating several chances and delivering crosses into the box, but Belgium’s defence held firm, and Courtois made key saves to preserve the slim advantage. Belgium saw out the closing stages to secure the 1–0 win and top Group F after the opening round of fixtures.

Key events:

10′ – Alphonso Davies (Canada) penalty saved by Thibaut Courtois.

44′ – Michy Batshuayi (Belgium) goal.

Belgium’s late first-half strike proved decisive in a match that saw Canada dominate possession and create more attempts overall, but lack the cutting edge in the final third.
