Argentina 3–3 France (Argentina win 4–2 on penalties)
2022 FIFA World Cup Final, Lusail Iconic Stadium, Lusail – 18 December 2022

The 2022 World Cup final produced one of the most memorable matches in the competition’s history. Argentina opened the scoring in the 23rd minute when Lionel Messi converted a penalty after a foul on Ángel Di María, giving them an early advantage. Argentina extended their lead in the 36th minute when Di María finished a swift team move with a composed strike.

France responded late in normal time. In the 80th minute, Kylian Mbappé converted a penalty after a foul in the box, and just one minute later (81st), he fired in a volley to level the score at 2–2 and send the match into extra time.

In extra time, Messi restored Argentina’s lead in the 108th minute with a close-range finish after a rebound, only for France to be awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute, which Mbappé converted to complete his hat-trick and make it 3–3—only the second World Cup final hat-trick in history.

With the score tied after 120 minutes, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Argentina scored all four of their spot-kicks, while France missed two, giving Argentina a 4–2 shoot-out victory. Gonzalo Montiel converted the decisive penalty to seal Argentina’s third World Cup title and their first since 1986.
