England 0–0 Algeria
2010 FIFA World Cup – Group C, Green Point Stadium, Cape Town – 18 June 2010

England and Algeria played out a goalless draw in their 2010 World Cup Group C match. England, coached by Fabio Capello, fielded David James in goal and made changes including Jamie Carragher and Gareth Barry to their starting lineup. Despite controlling possession at times and creating some openings, including efforts from Frank Lampard and Gareth Barry, England failed to find a breakthrough against a resilient Algerian side. Algeria, organised and disciplined, defended well and limited England’s attacking threat, with goalkeeper Raïs M’Bolhi making key interventions to preserve a clean sheet. The game remained scoreless through 90 minutes, leaving both teams with only a point from the encounter. England’s performance lacked cutting edge in front of goal, and efforts to inject pace with substitutions did not yield the desired result.

Key events:

No goals scored – Match finished 0–0.

Substitutions: Shaun Wright-Phillips for Aaron Lennon, Jermain Defoe for Emile Heskey, Peter Crouch later introduced.

Yellow card: Jamie Carragher (England).
