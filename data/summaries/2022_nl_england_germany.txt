Germany 1–1 England
2022–23 UEFA Nations League – Group A3, Allianz Arena, Munich – 7 June 2022

Germany and England shared the points in a competitive Nations League encounter in Munich, with both goals coming in the second half. The first half was evenly balanced, with Germany enjoying slightly more possession and England looking to threaten on the counter. Chances were limited, though both goalkeepers were tested by long-range efforts and quick transitions.

Germany took the lead in the 50th minute when Jonas Hofmann finished calmly from inside the box after a well-worked attacking move, capitalising on space down the right to give the hosts a deserved advantage. Following the goal, Germany continued to press, while England gradually increased their attacking intent through substitutions and higher tempo.

England’s pressure grew late in the match, particularly through wide deliveries and forward runs from midfield. Their persistence was rewarded in the 88th minute, when Harry Kane was fouled in the penalty area and confidently converted the resulting spot-kick to equalise. The closing minutes saw both sides push cautiously for a winner, but neither was able to find a decisive breakthrough.

The match ended 1–1, reflecting a closely fought contest between two evenly matched teams in the group stage.
