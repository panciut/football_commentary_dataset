England 2–0 Sweden
2018 FIFA World Cup – Quarter-Final, Samara Arena, Samara – 7 July 2018

England reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1990 with a well-controlled victory over Sweden. The opening goal came in the 30th minute when Harry Maguire met Ashley Young’s corner with a powerful header, giving England a lead they would not relinquish.

Sweden had opportunities early in the second half, with Marcus Berg forcing saves from England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, but England’s defence held firm. England extended their lead in the 59th minute as Dele Alli headed in Jesse Lingard’s cross from close range, securing a second goal and effectively putting the match beyond Sweden’s reach.

England managed the remainder of the game with discipline, maintaining their advantage and limiting Sweden to few clear chances. Their clean sheet was aided by key saves from Pickford, particularly from Berg and Viktor Claesson.

Key events:

30′ – Harry Maguire (England) goal.
