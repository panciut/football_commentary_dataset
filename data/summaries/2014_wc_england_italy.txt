England 1–2 Italy
2014 FIFA World Cup – Group D, Arena da Amazônia, Manaus – 14 June 2014

Italy began their World Cup campaign with a narrow victory over England in a fast-paced and open Group D encounter played in extreme heat. England started brightly, but Italy struck first in the 35th minute when Claudio Marchisio finished low from the edge of the box after sustained possession.

England responded quickly. Just two minutes later, in the 37th minute, Daniel Sturridge levelled the match with a composed finish across goal following a through ball from Wayne Rooney. The equaliser briefly swung momentum in England’s favour.

Italy regained the lead before half-time in the 50th minute, when Mario Balotelli headed in from close range after a precise cross from Antonio Candreva. England pushed for a second equaliser in the latter stages, creating chances through Sturridge and substitute Ross Barkley, but were unable to break through Italy’s defence.

The match ended 2–1 in Italy’s favour, leaving England with no points from their opening group game and under pressure heading into the remaining fixtures.
