France 2–0 Morocco
2022 FIFA World Cup – Semi-Final, Al Bayt Stadium, Al Khor – 14 December 2022

France reached the World Cup final with a steady performance against Morocco in their semi-final tie. The match opened early when Théo Hernández put France ahead in the 5th minute, meeting a loose ball in the box and finishing with an acrobatic volley to give Les Bleus an early advantage.

After weathering Moroccan pressure that produced a few half chances but no goal, France regained control as the game wore on. The decisive second goal came late in the match: substitute Randal Kolo Muani scored in the 79th minute shortly after entering, pouncing on a ricochet and slotting home from close range to extend the lead and secure the victory.

Morocco, making history as the first African nation to reach a World Cup semi-final, defended resolutely for periods of the match and created a few opportunities — including close efforts from Ounahi and chance-creating set pieces — but were unable to convert.

Key events:

5′ – Théo Hernández (France) goal.

79′ – Randal Kolo Muani (France) goal.

France’s 2–0 win saw them advance to the World Cup final against Argentina.
