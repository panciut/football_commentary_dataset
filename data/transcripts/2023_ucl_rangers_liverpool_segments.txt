[0.00 - 5.00] P:1932.30 E:0.042186 |  Cholak up front rather than Marelos as it was at Anfield.
[5.00 - 10.36] P:1912.71 E:0.102043 |  And for Liverpool, Alisson in goal, a back four of Gomez in for the injured Alexander-Arnold.
[10.36 - 16.04] P:2039.65 E:0.102230 |  Canate, his first start of the season, Van Dijk and Simikas, Fabinho and Henderson,
[16.04 - 19.08] P:2036.60 E:0.103502 |  Elliot Carvalho, Firmino and Nunes.
[19.08 - 22.76] P:1969.19 E:0.088116 |  There's the whistle from Slavko Vincic.
[22.76 - 27.72] P:1910.87 E:0.098675 |  Rangers, Liverpool gets underway and immediately Liverpool fire the ball forward
[27.72 - 32.44] P:1929.73 E:0.091984 |  towards the edge of the Rangers penalty area and it's whacked away out of play for a throwing
[32.44 - 38.76] P:1870.17 E:0.098275 |  for Liverpool out on the left-hand side and Liverpool immediately knocking the ball back
[38.76 - 43.00] P:1901.26 E:0.102660 |  towards the edge of the penalty area where Van Dijk turns, Cholak will come to close
[43.00 - 51.32] P:1937.59 E:0.101940 |  him down, Cholak, 13-goal top scorer for Rangers this season with six goals in his last four
[51.32 - 52.32] P:1914.56 E:0.105329 |  appearances.
[52.32 - 56.36] P:1911.70 E:0.108993 |  Fabinho passing the ball back to the edge of the box, Van Dijk is there to see it to
[56.48 - 61.32] P:1863.76 E:0.089985 |  Alisson who passes it just in front of Cholak, back to Van Dijk and then forward it goes
[61.32 - 67.00] P:1925.35 E:0.093159 |  towards Carvalho, deep inside his own half, Liverpool moving forward quickly, all in red
[67.00 - 72.96] P:1873.44 E:0.089659 |  with a white trim, white numbers crossing the halfway line and back it goes to Van Dijk
[72.96 - 76.08] P:1883.84 E:0.088214 |  again, goes long this time with his left foot.
[76.08 - 80.68] P:1944.20 E:0.098434 |  That's one for Nunes to chase, Nunes reaches it on the edge of the penalty area, Davis
[80.68 - 83.88] P:1793.18 E:0.094454 |  went across there with him and it's hooked away and cleared away.
[83.92 - 90.12] P:1883.61 E:0.085912 |  To Henderson, Senderfield going, Henderson flicks it, past Arfield, Henderson now to
[90.12 - 94.32] P:1945.45 E:0.098649 |  the right-hand side to Gomez, Elliott has come out to the right as well.
[94.32 - 99.48] P:1963.12 E:0.109430 |  Gio van Bronco is trying to gip his team on the edge of the coaching area there, Liverpool
[99.48 - 103.88] P:1930.05 E:0.099287 |  have seen lots of possession in the early stages, Elliott now, Harvey Elliott the teenager
[103.88 - 108.88] P:1803.65 E:0.083183 |  back to Jordan Henderson and Liverpool go back into their own half, again Van Dijk and
[108.88 - 113.48] P:1974.47 E:0.101537 |  Canate, Rangers can't get the ball in the opening stages, this is not promising for
[113.48 - 119.08] P:1954.34 E:0.093895 |  them, Liverpool are doing their best here to kill this vibrant atmosphere inside Ibrox
[119.08 - 123.20] P:1880.47 E:0.094233 |  and finally Barisic has a touch and he's able to go back to McGregor who will hit it long
[123.20 - 128.44] P:1842.10 E:0.087475 |  to the halfway line but a clear pattern already emerging Jonathan Woodgate.
[128.44 - 132.92] P:1771.66 E:0.096168 |  Yeah you can see it, with Carvalho just coming off the left-hand side, he's playing more
[132.92 - 137.88] P:1901.61 E:0.109751 |  like an inside forward and so has Harvey Elliott being really tight inside the pitch.
[137.88 - 144.48] P:1884.12 E:0.098565 |  Well that was a real cruncher from Canate on Ryan Jack on the halfway line and I ten
[144.48 - 152.68] P:1962.46 E:0.104212 |  yards in from the coaching areas here, he got ball but he certainly got man as well.
[152.68 - 158.20] P:1873.36 E:0.100450 |  It's a good tackle Jonny, in my view, let him know he was there as a lot of centre-backs
[158.20 - 162.64] P:1790.73 E:0.090336 |  used to do, not so much now but just going back onto Liverpool then, why they dominated
[162.64 - 166.44] P:1784.02 E:0.082619 |  the ball early there because they had a lot of options in the centre of the pitch with
[166.44 - 170.56] P:1793.11 E:0.090365 |  Elliott tucking in off the right-hand side, Carvalho coming off the left and then you've
[170.56 - 175.56] P:1822.57 E:0.091977 |  got Firmino, they're really stuck in the area up and the beauty of this in the sea,
[175.56 - 179.04] P:1823.40 E:0.085987 |  a range is caught with the movement of Elliott and Carvalho.
[179.04 - 183.56] P:1919.12 E:0.099652 |  Jack's okay, he's back up on his feet, that was a real juddero wasn't it, the challenge
[183.56 - 186.44] P:1862.82 E:0.088416 |  from Canate here as I say is starting for the first time this season.
[186.44 - 187.44] P:1611.36 E:0.052534 |  It was a lovely tackle Jonny.
[187.44 - 192.68] P:1843.03 E:0.095258 |  It was, it was, yeah and he enjoyed it, you could tell the way Canate got to his feet.
[192.68 - 193.68] P:1905.53 E:0.103709 |  Saw the line.
[193.68 - 195.68] P:1903.65 E:0.092156 |  Yes, I can tell that as well.
[195.68 - 201.68] P:1927.75 E:0.098558 |  And, range has, have a throw, half-way inside, deliver through half.
[201.68 - 207.92] P:1895.30 E:0.103072 |  All they are saying is give us a goal in the Champions League and if they do get one for
[207.92 - 215.76] P:1819.16 E:0.081089 |  the first time in this group stage you will know about it via your radio as McGregor has
[215.76 - 220.92] P:1861.53 E:0.094702 |  the ball at the back, one of the stars, the real star really for Rangers last week, kept
[220.92 - 221.92] P:1943.33 E:0.099373 |  the score down.
[222.16 - 225.76] P:1933.07 E:0.094925 |  There's a ball over the top for Kent, the former Liverpool youngster.
[225.76 - 228.04] P:1880.92 E:0.093049 |  Ryan Kent is onto it in the full back position.
[228.04 - 232.76] P:1883.59 E:0.088520 |  Kent then rolls it back, Barasic is behind him, takes a touch, knocks it in field, Lundström
[232.76 - 237.84] P:1872.02 E:0.093036 |  is there, the Liverpool fan is a boy, he was talking about it to us yesterday, Jon Lundström
[237.84 - 242.56] P:1861.48 E:0.095593 |  and then back it goes to Davis on the half-way line, another former Liverpool player.
[242.56 - 246.76] P:1970.12 E:0.100766 |  Lundström goes cross-field out to the right-hand side, Sakala is there, left foot shot but
[246.76 - 253.36] P:2003.27 E:0.094943 |  it's weak and Allyson is able to drop onto it quite comfortably but there we have it,
[253.36 - 258.76] P:1905.17 E:0.093040 |  Rangers first attempt on goal in the fourth minute this week as opposed to I think it
[258.76 - 260.76] P:2007.69 E:0.088477 |  was the 84th last week.
[260.76 - 267.16] P:1972.49 E:0.091475 |  It was a lovely cross-field pass, just got in behind Simicast, the weak shot in the end
[267.16 - 271.32] P:1864.64 E:0.061215 |  but at least they're starting to get on the front foot.
[271.32 - 278.20] P:1886.37 E:0.086024 |  It was Sakala with the shot, fashion Sakala who's come into the team tonight compared to
[278.20 - 284.48] P:1978.43 E:0.102279 |  last week but he did start on Saturday and scored the late fourth goal against St. Mirren.
[284.48 - 290.32] P:1956.08 E:0.100902 |  Rangers coming for it again, here's Kent once more on the left wing, Kent running at Gomez,
[290.32 - 296.80] P:1991.32 E:0.105075 |  into the penalty area now onto his right foot, goes for a curler but wide and high by about
[296.80 - 297.80] P:2012.59 E:0.093564 |  a yard.
[298.28 - 302.48] P:1904.39 E:0.094488 |  It was a good strike, it was positive but you can see they're trying to get down the
[302.48 - 307.24] P:1891.58 E:0.099516 |  sides of Liverpool with Gomez and Simicast on the left-hand side.
[307.24 - 314.12] P:1871.87 E:0.098579 |  They'll see that as a weakness in the Liverpool team with the two main full-backs out.
[314.12 - 320.04] P:1856.51 E:0.101523 |  Rangers 0, Liverpool 0, this is five-lives from the BBC, BBC sounds as well, radio-mergy
[320.04 - 324.88] P:1925.99 E:0.099995 |  side-listner is with us again tonight so great to have you with us as Liverpool break forward
[325.36 - 332.20] P:1941.39 E:0.090302 |  but good work from Rangers, Davis is able to tidy that up and go back to Golgi, back
[332.20 - 336.32] P:1823.65 E:0.083498 |  to McGregor to a raucous round of applause.
[336.32 - 341.72] P:1803.33 E:0.097346 |  The rhythm continues to beat out from the stand to our left, floodlights brightly on
[341.72 - 346.24] P:1837.79 E:0.093657 |  at Iverock's and here's Carvalho turning, carrying it forward down the left-hand side,
[346.24 - 351.20] P:1867.14 E:0.093555 |  Simicast is there in support, the Greek, Andy Robertson is on the substitute bench for Liverpool
[351.20 - 356.16] P:1803.35 E:0.089670 |  tonight if you didn't hear Sarah that earlier, back to the half-way line to Van Dijk, Van
[356.16 - 361.52] P:1854.09 E:0.092006 |  Dijk, forward through the middle to Harvey Elliott who turns away from Arfield, left-footed
[361.52 - 366.36] P:1873.71 E:0.101242 |  ball to Simicast on the left-hand side, Simicast now goes for the early cross towards Nourniers
[366.36 - 369.76] P:1851.13 E:0.097786 |  but it's over the top again, a little hop after the ball but he knew he wasn't going
[369.76 - 372.44] P:1822.65 E:0.089230 |  to be able to get there and it's out for a throw at the Rangers.
[372.44 - 376.92] P:1682.53 E:0.102682 |  Tavirni is going to have a real problem, a real problem when Carvalho comes inside and
[376.92 - 382.72] P:1743.70 E:0.095670 |  he's got Simicast on the wide outside of him, he's got a real problem and if they don't
[382.72 - 386.08] P:1767.30 E:0.085005 |  sort that out now, Carvalho's start dominating it.
[386.08 - 391.88] P:1776.57 E:0.095333 |  0-0, Rangers clearing from the left-back position, but Fabinho's got up there to head it forward
[391.88 - 396.72] P:1842.37 E:0.106428 |  and OTI are going the team tonight by that, he's on the substitute, Manchester City on
[396.72 - 401.52] P:1825.46 E:0.104430 |  Sunday at Anfield, that's a five-life commentary match incidentally and then Jack slides into
[401.52 - 410.24] P:1913.38 E:0.110994 |  the challenge, he got the ball but Nourniers was standing behind the ball and there was
[410.24 - 418.72] P:1841.38 E:0.090999 |  contact but he went down rather theatrically and referee Vintcourt just waved play on.
[418.72 - 424.12] P:1824.97 E:0.093527 |  Rangers Nill, Liverpool Nill, we're also with Tottenham tonight, the Germans, Eintracht
[424.12 - 428.24] P:1796.40 E:0.106310 |  Frankfurt, the team that beat Rangers in the Europa League final last season, other visitors
[428.24 - 431.68] P:1813.82 E:0.106768 |  there tonight and Anders de Bruis-Balls watching from on high I guess.
[431.68 - 436.44] P:1787.02 E:0.112580 |  Yeah, cracking atmosphere in here too John, five minutes gone, 0-0, Frankfurt putting the
[436.44 - 440.20] P:1828.77 E:0.110680 |  pressure on early on, Tottenham guilty of giving the ball away, causing themselves a
[440.20 - 445.00] P:1747.57 E:0.104469 |  few problems, you mentioned that Europa League success last season, they were excellent away
[445.00 - 448.84] P:1810.54 E:0.103393 |  from home in particular, they started well tonight Frankfurt, Tottenham 0-0.
[448.84 - 453.56] P:1785.52 E:0.095415 |  Well if you remember Rangers were excellent at home last season, unbeaten on the knockout
[453.56 - 458.52] P:1864.98 E:0.094061 |  stages here at Ibrox in that run to the final in Seville, Rangers playing the ball down
[458.52 - 462.16] P:1898.58 E:0.095049 |  the left but Arfield couldn't keep it in and it's out of play for Liverpool throw.
[462.16 - 466.84] P:1814.91 E:0.090518 |  I can tell you in the Champions League as well it's Bayer Levy-Kussen, Nill Porto 1
[466.84 - 473.36] P:1805.57 E:0.095092 |  with Shabia Lonzo now in charge of Bayer Levy-Kussen, had a great win at the weekend in the Bundesliga
[473.36 - 479.52] P:1815.99 E:0.095401 |  but 1-0 down at home to Porto in that group, already in that group, Atletico Madrid, Nill,
[479.64 - 484.68] P:1700.34 E:0.097020 |  club Bruise, Nill tonight, so that's the first match, the club Bruise have failed to win
[484.68 - 491.00] P:1733.27 E:0.098418 |  the group leaders and Atletico Madrid now with four points in the group, seven minutes played,
[491.00 - 496.20] P:1691.58 E:0.100056 |  Rangers Nill, Liverpool Nill, Bristol City Nill, Preston Nill as well in the one match
[496.20 - 501.28] P:1745.78 E:0.091473 |  that's been played in the Championship this evening as Ben Davis goes all the way back
[501.28 - 505.88] P:1842.85 E:0.097182 |  to the man in yellow, McGregor who clears rather waywardly, actually it's controlled
[505.88 - 511.20] P:1797.62 E:0.092470 |  by Giovanni van Vromkos, the Rangers manager down there on the edge of the coaching area,
[511.20 - 516.04] P:1761.73 E:0.096728 |  Champions League winner remember, van Vromkos lead and is playing days with Barcelona,
[516.04 - 521.16] P:1778.32 E:0.103543 |  throwing taken in field by Liverpool, Fabinho is lifting it back into his own half, Joe Gomez
[521.16 - 525.80] P:1865.08 E:0.102733 |  now heads it back for Canate and Canate goes back to goalkeeper Alisson.
[527.24 - 532.00] P:1879.07 E:0.104894 |  So Carlos gonna have to do some work defensively to follow Simicas constantly in this game
[532.00 - 534.80] P:1878.01 E:0.102447 |  because Taverny is starting to go all the way for Cavaleo now.
[536.00 - 541.20] P:1880.06 E:0.107973 |  Here's Fabinho just heading forward from inside his own half, Cavaleo goes down but the referee says play on.
[542.20 - 544.96] P:1909.54 E:0.111228 |  Fabinho takes it to the halfway line and then in comes the challenge,
[544.96 - 549.80] P:1843.43 E:0.085297 |  good one from Conor Colson and advances out for a throw in to Liverpool.
[549.80 - 555.24] P:1848.67 E:0.091978 |  So lots of Liverpool possession early on but it's Rangers who've had the couple of meaningful
[555.24 - 560.80] P:1884.51 E:0.101229 |  efforts at goal, that shot from Sicala that was comfortably saved and then the effort over the
[560.80 - 568.00] P:1887.06 E:0.104209 |  angle of post with Barth from Kent, upside flag up against Liverpool and the ball's kicked away by
[569.76 - 575.28] P:1854.87 E:0.095909 |  Carvalho and referee Vintcourt comes across and just wags the finger at young Carvalho.
[576.40 - 578.08] P:1827.26 E:0.097514 |  And this players pass that job.
[578.08 - 580.96] P:1809.15 E:0.098846 |  Yeah so it's a free kick to Rangers inside their own half.
[580.96 - 581.84] P:1811.63 E:0.100433 |  The youth in him.
[581.84 - 588.80] P:1802.21 E:0.094877 |  Yeah Rangers take this free kick goal over the top of Sicala, Simicas is headed away,
[588.88 - 592.48] P:1861.78 E:0.093051 |  now Lundstranz on to this, Liverpool's shouting for handball, it's not given.
[592.48 - 598.80] P:1822.32 E:0.098744 |  In comes the cross, Trollac was lurking but it was headed away by Canate who got there first and then it's cleared.
[598.80 - 604.80] P:1881.11 E:0.107396 |  Up towards Darwin Nunes on the halfway line, Goldson together and Nunes then kicking out of the ball
[604.80 - 609.04] P:1924.64 E:0.106208 |  has actually kicked Goldson who's gone down and it's a free kick that Liverpool are disputing.
[609.04 - 613.68] P:1752.74 E:0.102396 |  Nunes has to do better there to bread and butter ball, he has to hold onto that ball, make it stick,
[613.68 - 617.84] P:1697.66 E:0.094939 |  make it difficult for the defender but he ends up giving it free kick away, frustrating because
[618.40 - 619.84] P:1715.97 E:0.109619 |  it's an easy ball to take in.
[621.12 - 626.56] P:1713.33 E:0.096630 |  Incidentally with the referee Vintcourt today last week at Anfield they appointed the referee that
[626.56 - 631.52] P:1791.89 E:0.092019 |  took charge of Liverpool in the Champions League final last season, Clenon Turpan.
[631.52 - 636.16] P:1783.91 E:0.098065 |  This week it's the referee who took charge of Rangers in the Europa League final last season
[636.16 - 641.20] P:1933.15 E:0.092592 |  in Seville. Back it goes to McGregor with the ball in front of his penalty area.
[641.20 - 646.08] P:1963.91 E:0.094269 |  Nilnil if you've just joined us here at an atmospheric I-Brocks, long downfield from
[646.16 - 650.24] P:1945.15 E:0.097443 |  McGregor but Allison is able to come to the edge of his penalty area, actually took a couple of
[650.24 - 656.72] P:1795.04 E:0.098024 |  steps outside before dancing back in and caught the bouncing ball. Elliott back to Canate and
[656.72 - 660.56] P:1948.79 E:0.113720 |  that's a tour pass from Canate giving away the 10 and then putting the challenge on Trollhack,
[660.56 - 665.36] P:1932.35 E:0.101331 |  it's not giving us a free kick but Rangers are able to tidy up Cavaniere going across
[665.36 - 672.64] P:1861.71 E:0.098746 |  and passes it back to McGregor. That is strong, strong again that's two tackles now.
[673.60 - 679.20] P:1886.15 E:0.103955 |  He looks like a man who's come into the team quite possibly because of Matt's injury but
[679.20 - 682.72] P:1961.87 E:0.109620 |  he looks like a man who's set on keeping his place. Well he's got a chance to stay in the
[682.72 - 687.20] P:1860.33 E:0.087419 |  team hasn't he with the situation of Matt at the minute but he's doing well. It's going to be a
[687.20 - 692.80] P:1931.66 E:0.097963 |  couple of weeks or so for Matt before he's fit. Same for Alexander-Arnold by the way if you didn't
[692.80 - 698.32] P:1903.64 E:0.098212 |  hear that news yesterday and Sadio Mane has scored for Bayern Munich tonight, Victoria Plitzen-Nil
[699.12 - 706.00] P:1841.27 E:0.092179 |  Bayern Munich won Bayern already nine points out of nine in that group where it's Barcelona-Nil
[706.00 - 712.00] P:1868.87 E:0.095815 |  into Nil. Henderson, bouncing ball inside his own half then it's headed forward by Lundstra. Ryan
[712.00 - 718.96] P:1847.40 E:0.090849 |  Kent tries to turn it to Trollhack but Gomez got there first and he hands off Trollhack with his
[718.96 - 723.68] P:1814.38 E:0.098416 |  upper arm really. Trollhack goes down no free kick he's let that go as well the referee you like
[723.68 - 729.68] P:1944.07 E:0.097990 |  in that I can tell Liverpool go forward through the middle to Nunez. Nunez then challenged good
[729.68 - 733.84] P:1883.75 E:0.097645 |  challenge as well went back by Goldsson but the pass forward is over hit by Lundstra and
[733.84 - 742.00] P:1845.80 E:0.091206 |  then Arlesons got it. Trollhack's been it three times now once by Gomez once by Kanat it he
[742.00 - 749.84] P:1797.83 E:0.101372 |  doesn't like it he doesn't like it. He's done tremendously well after signing in the summer
[749.92 - 756.56] P:1881.77 E:0.101062 |  Antonio Trollhack 13 goals he's got that crucial goal in Eindhoven against PSV that won the tie
[756.56 - 760.64] P:1870.41 E:0.097141 |  and got Rangers back into the group stages of the Champions League for the first time
[761.28 - 768.64] P:1758.46 E:0.094990 |  for 12 years. Rangers, Liverpool in possession now Liverpool six times winners of this competition
[768.64 - 773.20] P:1869.51 E:0.107428 |  Kanate to Elliott and Elliott does well and takes it on through the middle and chips the ball to
[773.20 - 779.68] P:1939.43 E:0.096800 |  Nunez and Nunez plays it across but Cavaniere was able to move over and volley it behind
[779.76 - 784.56] P:1827.76 E:0.085841 |  and actually the offside flag was up against Nunez. Harvey Elliott looks so excited there when he got
[784.56 - 790.56] P:1857.82 E:0.089912 |  on the ball and drove at the Rangers defend a cute little pass. It was a knee offside John,
[790.56 - 796.96] P:1760.53 E:0.099080 |  a knee offside but Howard's excited when he came in off the line you can just see Liverpool overloading
[797.52 - 804.64] P:1785.94 E:0.084385 |  that central area it's like a 4v3 in the central area of the pitch and yet Harvey Elliott there found
[804.64 - 808.80] P:1865.48 E:0.095294 |  space. He found space he's got that in there he's got that in his locker-lashing when he drives
[808.80 - 815.04] P:1948.78 E:0.090695 |  it clears and that's when he's at his best. What do we think for the Liverpool system then 4-4-2
[815.76 - 821.44] P:1948.68 E:0.097869 |  I mean Anderson Fabinho together in the middle there. Out of possession the press 4-4-2 in possession
[821.44 - 830.32] P:1903.33 E:0.101092 |  the 4-2-2-1 sorry 4-2-2-2 yes get your fingers sorted though with Elliott on the right hand side
[830.32 - 838.24] P:1841.02 E:0.093794 |  Calvario on the left hand side and then up front Firmino towards the left and Nunez towards the right
[838.24 - 844.96] P:1897.60 E:0.101544 |  off that front two when it is a front two. Rangers 0 Liverpool 0 is the score here on 5 live
[845.60 - 852.24] P:1816.06 E:0.091860 |  and Ibrox and Rangers in possession inside their own half but certainly tonight I'm relieved to
[852.24 - 857.76] P:1906.66 E:0.098302 |  say pleased to say this is much more of a contest as Rangers hit the ball downfield
[857.76 - 863.12] P:1859.59 E:0.096471 |  Goldsons over hit that and it's out of play for a throw to Liverpool deep inside their own half.
[863.76 - 870.88] P:1850.28 E:0.089793 |  So back four for Van Fronkost tonight. By and Munich now 2-0 up at Victoria Plitsen. Thomas Mullack
[870.88 - 876.64] P:1869.50 E:0.097275 |  has scored the second after Sadio Mane scored the first. So no no Leon King in the starting
[876.64 - 881.12] P:1799.85 E:0.090863 |  line-up tonight the 18 year old he's on the bench Stephen Davis on the bench as well tonight the
[881.12 - 887.04] P:1883.25 E:0.090531 |  disappointing Kilman from the first match and James Sands as well back from suspension couldn't
[887.04 - 893.44] P:1969.59 E:0.095633 |  play at Anfield he's among the substitutes. No Glenn Kamara incidentally who has got a little
[893.44 - 898.48] P:1900.05 E:0.094154 |  injury so he is not involved. Barasic long ball over the top towards the edge of the area.
[899.84 - 904.48] P:1887.22 E:0.100437 |  Now down on his chest Gomez is very very tight on him. Elliott helps him out and Liverpool
[904.48 - 908.16] P:1850.55 E:0.101424 |  have got the ball back and Gomez wins the throw in in that right back area.
[908.16 - 913.36] P:1771.91 E:0.092324 |  That can be strong there Gomez. Will Neujer from the Liverpool days, Kent had a few loans.
[914.16 - 919.20] P:1769.04 E:0.093119 |  Ryan Kent Bristol City is one of them. I think there's a great sign under Stephen Gerrard.
[919.92 - 924.08] P:1608.61 E:0.094368 |  We've got a real good team together Gerrard at the time Van Fronkost took over.
[925.36 - 928.32] P:1859.02 E:0.094487 |  Yeah when he's on he's a real talent isn't he Ryan Kent.
[929.04 - 933.52] P:1937.73 E:0.097605 |  Oh and it goes from Gomez but that's walloped away back downfield from Ben Davis who never
[933.52 - 937.36] P:1858.56 E:0.098570 |  actually got on to the field for the Liverpool first team in the brief time that he was there
[937.36 - 942.16] P:1881.84 E:0.100766 |  Ben Davis. He has lunced run now at the back lunced run to heavy first touch but he's able to
[942.16 - 946.24] P:1783.94 E:0.101713 |  get into the challenge and pass it back to the back line. Goldson now out to the right hand side
[946.96 - 952.32] P:1943.16 E:0.108471 |  and that has been an opening goal in the top of Eintracht Frankfurt game. Alistair Bruce Ball.
[952.32 - 955.68] P:1936.73 E:0.109619 |  It's gone to the visitors Tottenham have made a right and messed the things at the back.
[955.68 - 959.68] P:1910.47 E:0.106860 |  Poor touch from Eric Dyer on the edge of his own box. Frankfurt won at Hugo Larisse,
[959.68 - 963.68] P:1908.61 E:0.106764 |  dived in to try and help things out, palmed the ball into the middle of his penalty area
[963.68 - 969.28] P:1882.26 E:0.099128 |  and Sebastian Röder passed it to Camada and Camada stroked it home. Tottenham Niel, Frankfurt won.
[969.28 - 975.68] P:1886.78 E:0.089162 |  Well still sporting Niel Marseille, Niel sporting top of that group and Tottenham and Frankfurt both
[975.68 - 983.12] P:1864.85 E:0.088043 |  with four points coming in tonight so Frankfurt winning one Niel at Tottenham. Niel Niel here
[983.12 - 986.72] P:1885.34 E:0.106962 |  while we're listening to Ali Reigns just had a little bit of pressure around the Liverpool box but
[986.72 - 992.80] P:1748.20 E:0.077253 |  it came to nothing Jonathan. Yeah I'm just down. It's a lackluster cross into the box really.
[993.44 - 999.04] P:1855.46 E:0.086603 |  You can see how Reigns are trying to build up possession if Liverpool don't press them.
[999.28 - 1001.76] P:1832.32 E:0.091895 |  They're being patient with the ball but then Liverpool get the shape and the
[1002.32 - 1005.04] P:1745.86 E:0.093789 |  Reigns as a town can find it difficult to play through this Liverpool team.
[1005.60 - 1008.24] P:1793.04 E:0.106132 |  Especially through the middle they're trying to go wide at a dover.
[1008.24 - 1013.76] P:1781.16 E:0.086625 |  Yeah Reigns is with the ball at the back. Davis goes for that high ball again looking for it
[1013.76 - 1018.16] P:1868.27 E:0.088974 |  out towards the far side. Cicala up against Simicast but that's a good leap by Simicast to win the
[1018.16 - 1022.64] P:1969.21 E:0.117730 |  header however Reigns is having back here. So Arfield through the middle, Arfield scores!
[1023.36 - 1033.44] P:1978.93 E:0.117509 |  Rages are in front and Glory B, Rages have a goal in the Champions League group stage again.
[1037.84 - 1046.48] P:1989.90 E:0.112284 |  What a noise inside Ibrox as the 33 year old Scott Arfield buried it into the bottom corner
[1046.56 - 1048.72] P:1854.67 E:0.118361 |  and it's Rages won Liverpool 0.
[1050.24 - 1054.16] P:1884.90 E:0.104545 |  What a run by Arfield at the box he wasn't matched by Favigno.
[1054.16 - 1059.92] P:1889.90 E:0.101626 |  It was a long diagonal pass to pick up the second Cavalio lost it but he just runs off the bat.
[1059.92 - 1064.24] P:1879.57 E:0.100958 |  I think it was Henderson in the end but what a finish. What a finish. Gomez couldn't come
[1064.24 - 1075.12] P:1973.39 E:0.106561 |  round the cover, 1-0 Ranges. There is a goal check going on.
[1076.08 - 1081.84] P:1923.55 E:0.088669 |  Whoa that would burst the bubble wouldn't it? So a goal check is taking place. I think they've
[1081.84 - 1091.20] P:1920.34 E:0.092889 |  spotted it behind us. I can hear the Ranges regulars behind us but the game restarts and
[1091.28 - 1097.92] P:1954.91 E:0.088563 |  the goal check. The goal is approved and Scott Arfield coming into the team tonight. He has
[1097.92 - 1103.68] P:1932.81 E:0.092625 |  actually now Arfield started five of the last six matches but didn't play, didn't start the
[1103.68 - 1109.84] P:1907.98 E:0.092236 |  match at Anfield and what a finish. What a pinpoint finish it was from him. Brilliant finish and you
[1109.84 - 1114.88] P:1861.12 E:0.104499 |  look at him now in the midfield area, pausing down the Liverpool team but it took it so well.
[1115.20 - 1119.36] P:1937.91 E:0.099212 |  It was the timing of the running of the box off the back of I think it was Favigno
[1120.32 - 1125.20] P:1992.89 E:0.104879 |  and Gomez couldn't get round it quickly enough to track him but great finish.
[1125.20 - 1132.24] P:1982.84 E:0.105556 |  I can hardly hear you, Jonathan. In this vibrant atmosphere inside Ibrox where Liverpool are behind
[1133.28 - 1141.84] P:2064.59 E:0.113393 |  and Ranges have finally got a goal again in the group stages of the Champions League
[1142.64 - 1150.80] P:2039.14 E:0.102825 |  for the first time for 12 years. The last one was scored in northwest Turkey by Kenny Miller
[1150.80 - 1157.68] P:2026.64 E:0.087458 |  against Berzer Spore and tonight it's Scott Arfield who becomes the first man to score for
[1157.68 - 1164.64] P:1998.10 E:0.083207 |  Rangers in a competitive match against Liverpool as well. There's history all over that. Elliott
[1164.64 - 1171.52] P:1989.40 E:0.087125 |  heading it forward but Davis brings it down and now this crowd, this 50,000 crowd,
[1171.52 - 1176.48] P:2002.85 E:0.097270 |  Giovanni Broncos, all of the Rangers follow us everywhere. They've got what they wanted in
[1176.48 - 1180.80] P:1884.32 E:0.086060 |  this game, they've got their noses in front. Makes it twice as hard when you get the crowd up,
[1180.80 - 1187.28] P:1973.03 E:0.103320 |  especially this crowd. The atmosphere, the vibrant, the one more. Liverpool have only
[1187.28 - 1193.44] P:1995.89 E:0.100102 |  themselves a blame by not tracking Arfield into the box. Arfield found the space on the edge of
[1193.44 - 1198.96] P:1920.45 E:0.089710 |  the Liverpool penalty area just I think outside the box when he hit the shot from a slight angle
[1199.60 - 1207.04] P:1835.71 E:0.087233 |  and didn't he bury it into that bottom left hand corner. So Rangers won Liverpool 0 and that means
[1207.04 - 1214.80] P:1987.64 E:0.100407 |  that Liverpool for the eighth time this season in 13 competitive matches have gone behind.
[1215.36 - 1221.28] P:1923.95 E:0.089672 |  It's unheard of Liverpool under a Jurgen Klopp team. It really is. That's that way you've just said
[1221.28 - 1224.56] P:1841.53 E:0.082475 |  there is something wrong. There is it's the intensity. They look like
[1225.52 - 1229.44] P:1894.85 E:0.099570 |  the can't move as well as they did last season which is strange. It's there for Liverpool team.
[1229.44 - 1233.76] P:1963.24 E:0.097510 |  Rangers coming forward looking for a second. Having got a first, Arfield can't control it
[1233.76 - 1239.36] P:1964.10 E:0.092899 |  inside the penalty area and Van Dijk is able to hook it away. So Scott Arfield it is.
[1240.40 - 1247.52] P:1999.41 E:0.100387 |  Who is the goal hero so far and Liverpool defending now with Gomez who plays it back into
[1247.52 - 1253.44] P:2011.59 E:0.099801 |  the back of Cholak who touched it past Alison but there was no one else there in a blue shirt
[1253.44 - 1257.60] P:2004.77 E:0.107597 |  and he actually really just shuffled it across the penalty area and Alison was able to pick it up.
[1257.60 - 1261.52] P:1965.41 E:0.090790 |  Just a lack of concentration by Gomez. A lack of concentration. He doesn't even look
[1262.16 - 1267.20] P:1964.49 E:0.084613 |  once to his right hand side to see where the striker is to see if he can pass it back to Alison.
[1267.76 - 1271.84] P:1986.56 E:0.095090 |  Just a lack of concentration. Well we've got a contest now Jonathan.
[1272.24 - 1278.88] P:1972.13 E:0.101315 |  Yeah, really nice. Ball has played up to Nunes. Suggestions that you might have used an arm there
[1278.88 - 1288.80] P:1950.32 E:0.099934 |  but referee Vintcourt allows it to continue and here's Elliott now. Elliott receiving it 10 yards
[1288.80 - 1292.56] P:1947.58 E:0.099280 |  inside the Rangers half playing it to the right hand side. Nunes has balled across his block by
[1292.56 - 1297.36] P:1953.67 E:0.106393 |  Barasic and it's straight to Tottenham and Alistair Bruce Borgh again. Rapier thrust from Tottenham.
[1297.36 - 1301.76] P:1981.24 E:0.117189 |  They were only behind for six minutes. 1-1. You know who, Pastor, you know who.
[1301.76 - 1308.40] P:1966.23 E:0.104517 |  Kane De Son. Son buried it. Tottenham won. Frankfurt won. Rangers won. Liverpool nail in our five-life
[1308.40 - 1315.12] P:1998.75 E:0.092465 |  commentary match tonight in the Champions League as Liverpool win possession back in the central third.
[1315.12 - 1322.00] P:1977.87 E:0.081265 |  Fabinho. Nice change of feet there. That was classy from Fabinho. Just took it away. He used a little
[1322.00 - 1327.12] P:1944.10 E:0.088146 |  bit of pace as well. He has Henderson now. Henderson up towards the edge of the box.
[1327.12 - 1333.04] P:2016.11 E:0.096478 |  To Firmino. Liverpool's top scorer this season. Roberto Firmino with his six goals.
[1333.04 - 1337.76] P:2016.23 E:0.099967 |  Now for Fabinho, clicks it forward. Cavalio on the edge of the box. A low shot from him but
[1337.76 - 1342.24] P:1959.01 E:0.089983 |  as the challenge came in on him from Goulton, he hit it wide by one. A yard and a half.
[1342.24 - 1348.00] P:1955.73 E:0.089474 |  He glides past players though. Cavalio. He looks a real talent. Great buy from Fulham.
[1348.72 - 1353.92] P:1947.43 E:0.096467 |  You can see he's been courtsweller. Look at that football. He put the shot was just a couple of yards.
[1354.56 - 1357.84] P:1948.85 E:0.087964 |  Wider the post. That's better from Liverpool.
[1359.52 - 1365.12] P:1962.93 E:0.091270 |  Well, it was a let down. Frankly, the match last week in terms of being a contest. But this
[1366.16 - 1372.24] P:1929.31 E:0.083390 |  really is a grand occasion as Gomez takes the ball down and plays it back to Allyson.
[1372.24 - 1376.56] P:1970.38 E:0.086060 |  His careless pass almost letting Cholak in Rangers last attack.
[1376.56 - 1381.28] P:2037.95 E:0.099009 |  Ball bounces through the middle third. Nunez, a fortunate bounce off Davis. But a good recovery
[1381.28 - 1385.52] P:1943.86 E:0.098637 |  from Ben Davis to put in the challenge. But Liverpool win it back and Cavalio's onto this again
[1385.52 - 1388.72] P:1949.79 E:0.089986 |  and Cavalio Schutzen is deflected. But McGregor scrambling to his left.
[1390.48 - 1394.80] P:1961.17 E:0.091704 |  Tried to claw it away and lost it and it bounced behind through a corner to Liverpool.
[1394.80 - 1399.52] P:1924.22 E:0.084361 |  I think it was a spin on the ball. What a tackle by Ben Davies there when Nunez was going through.
[1400.72 - 1404.16] P:1962.51 E:0.093435 |  Well timed. Needs to be well-tuned. You're going to do last-ditch tackles.
[1405.28 - 1410.08] P:1931.91 E:0.085326 |  Yeah, the spin just seemed to take it away from McGregor as he was grabbing at it.
[1411.04 - 1417.44] P:1912.07 E:0.082524 |  Near the dead ball line. So it's a Liverpool corner. The Copeland road end to our right two
[1418.32 - 1423.84] P:1982.06 E:0.089951 |  levels of it. Pack with faces watching down as Simicast has a dummy run up.
[1423.84 - 1427.60] P:1945.02 E:0.086314 |  Up a little slope there towards the corner and stopped, thought about it again.
[1427.60 - 1434.16] P:1997.82 E:0.100352 |  So here's the second go-in to the near post and it's headed in by Firmino. So easy. He found
[1434.16 - 1440.48] P:2001.77 E:0.096727 |  space. Roberto Firmino inside the six yard box at the near post and just buried it in
[1440.48 - 1447.12] P:1919.13 E:0.085419 |  to make it rain just one Liverpool one. Brilliant header. That's Firmino. When his team needs him,
[1447.12 - 1451.76] P:1900.86 E:0.094424 |  he stands up, he delivers the ball in from Simicast, whipped into the near post.
[1453.52 - 1459.60] P:1870.93 E:0.088401 |  No one was marking Firmino but just used a bit of strength, guided it into the front area.
[1460.56 - 1469.28] P:1788.98 E:0.087039 |  Brilliant header. Yeah, did really well. Just held off the challenge from Tavernier.
[1469.28 - 1476.56] P:1883.36 E:0.080023 |  It was who was closest to him but flashed past McGregor into the back of the net and the Rangers
[1476.56 - 1486.32] P:1895.26 E:0.081949 |  lead lasted for seven minutes. So they've enjoyed those seven minutes but so quick, so simple.
[1486.32 - 1490.88] P:1866.60 E:0.088360 |  First corner of the match that Liverpool have had. They scored from a free kick and a penalty
[1490.88 - 1495.12] P:1668.49 E:0.099649 |  last week at Anfield and now they get a goal from another set piece this time a corner.
[1495.12 - 1500.40] P:1715.24 E:0.092413 |  The vital in the game. They're absolutely vital. Set plays, thrones, whatever you want.
[1501.12 - 1504.48] P:1784.25 E:0.096122 |  Liverpool are good at them and you need to be better than when you play against them.
[1504.48 - 1512.16] P:1875.76 E:0.098136 |  So it's 1-1 now. Rangers 1, Liverpool 1. Same score as at Tottenham where it's 1-1 between Spurs
[1512.16 - 1518.48] P:1989.21 E:0.095328 |  and Eintracht Frankfurt. Here's Alisson, the thickly deaded Liverpool goalie back.
[1519.12 - 1525.68] P:1910.91 E:0.087464 |  Passes the ball out to Van Dijk. Now Simicast on the left hand side. Simicast receives the
[1525.68 - 1529.76] P:1975.69 E:0.103744 |  ball back but Zicala put in the challenge and won it back from him. Here is the Rangers goal
[1529.76 - 1535.76] P:1964.70 E:0.100166 |  scorer, Arfield and now centrally Lundstrand loses out to Firmino and Firmino now away from the
[1535.76 - 1541.68] P:1972.69 E:0.091336 |  halfway line. Rangers do have men back but the pass to the left through Canuniers. The challenge
[1541.68 - 1547.36] P:1936.51 E:0.094990 |  came in on him from Goldsson and Rangers were able to get it away. Nunez has stayed down there
[1547.36 - 1552.88] P:1836.73 E:0.093284 |  inside the box. Looked a great tackle from Goldsson. Looked a really, really well timed tackle.
[1553.52 - 1556.80] P:1792.46 E:0.092071 |  The pass from Firmino was a little bit sloppy, it was a little bit lackluster but
[1558.08 - 1563.76] P:1915.39 E:0.078860 |  to make up for it there he's got the ball, the follow through might have just caught Nunes.
[1564.16 - 1573.20] P:1895.65 E:0.086838 |  I think he'll be, oh Nunes has caught him on the top of the sort of point where the bottom of his shin
[1573.92 - 1577.52] P:1885.21 E:0.092042 |  reaches the top of his foot. And that was just the follow through. Yeah and I think there was a
[1577.52 - 1583.92] P:1853.34 E:0.094974 |  little slip in there as well wasn't there from him when the challenge was put in. So DAR obviously
[1583.92 - 1590.32] P:1979.27 E:0.085091 |  will have a look at that but I think it'll be okay. Yeah the referee's just walking away from it now
[1590.80 - 1595.68] P:1830.26 E:0.097172 |  and Nunez is back on his feet. So Rangers won, Liverpool won. Pine Munich now running away with
[1596.72 - 1601.12] P:1846.95 E:0.097251 |  the tonight's group match against Victoria Plitz and they're now lead by three goals to
[1601.12 - 1608.56] P:1795.59 E:0.089118 |  nail. Goretz has got the latest one so that's Mane, Mullat and Goretzka and Marseille are winning
[1608.56 - 1616.08] P:1783.45 E:0.078802 |  one nail at Sporting in the Topland Frankfurt group. So that could be very tight if the score
[1616.08 - 1623.28] P:1833.54 E:0.083418 |  stays they are in that group and Sporting at about 10 men, Ricardo Esgayo has been sent off
[1623.28 - 1629.92] P:1836.04 E:0.083268 |  and from the result and penalty Matteo Genduzzi put Marseille in front and Tottenham's last
[1629.92 - 1636.48] P:1855.02 E:0.087167 |  match in that group is a way to Marseille. Marseille against Tottenham. I feel has got Chris Waddle's
[1636.48 - 1642.96] P:1932.91 E:0.090563 |  name written all over it don't you? You'll hear Chris by the way Saturday afternoon with Ian Dennis
[1642.96 - 1648.08] P:1908.54 E:0.090188 |  for the Wolves Nottingham Forest commentary at three o'clock. They've got Wolves Nottingham
[1648.08 - 1653.92] P:1860.59 E:0.084138 |  Forest and Tottenham Everton on Saturday and among our Sunday Premier League commentaries are
[1653.92 - 1659.84] P:1857.44 E:0.089233 |  Lee Darsnell and Five Live will be the place to also listen to Liverpool and Manchester City.
[1659.84 - 1665.68] P:1897.15 E:0.090991 |  So Rangers won, Liverpool won here in the Champions League tonight after Rangers scored first.
[1665.68 - 1671.36] P:1876.21 E:0.085509 |  Throyan is taken into the Rangers box. Nunez plays it back out of the penalty area, Henderson's
[1671.36 - 1675.12] P:1951.72 E:0.104672 |  attempted pass forward was cut out but Liverpool have won it back and here's
[1675.12 - 1679.28] P:1825.56 E:0.089223 |  Van Dijk's runs from the home supporters but Van Dijk's pass forward is also intercepted,
[1679.28 - 1684.80] P:1812.90 E:0.086442 |  fortunate that it comes back to it. Henderson now on the left hand side showing a little bit of pace
[1684.80 - 1691.04] P:1774.68 E:0.088750 |  there. The veteran as he almost is now, Simicast then back to the halfway line to virtual Van
[1691.04 - 1695.04] P:1806.24 E:0.089217 |  Dijk again and Liverpool have it inside their own heart. When you watch Firmino play constantly
[1695.04 - 1699.68] P:1827.04 E:0.089113 |  once the ball no matter what situations he's in, if he's got someone really close to him.
[1699.68 - 1702.96] P:1881.61 E:0.093096 |  All over the top this is for Caldwellio to chase but McGregor is out quickly in his
[1702.96 - 1708.08] P:1868.12 E:0.091087 |  identity to clutch the ball with both gloves in front of his chest as he came out and Caldwellio
[1708.08 - 1717.28] P:1940.29 E:0.086619 |  was running through to one-one the score. There is a penalty at Tottenham, Alastair Bruce Ball.
[1717.28 - 1721.84] P:1959.76 E:0.104804 |  Penalty four Tottenham, Tottenham won Frankfurt one, Harry Kane will take it, Harry Kane was
[1721.84 - 1726.56] P:1963.86 E:0.105479 |  fouled not initially given by the referee, picked up by the VAR, he was barged over by
[1726.64 - 1731.12] P:1958.36 E:0.097894 |  Christian Jakic, the referee was sent to the monitor, had three or four looks at it, has come
[1731.12 - 1736.32] P:1929.96 E:0.099153 |  back out under the pitch, changed his mind and Harry Kane now has a chance to put Tottenham in
[1736.32 - 1741.12] P:1903.85 E:0.104084 |  front. He's up against Kevin Trapp all in green, away to my left hand side, he's holding his arms
[1741.12 - 1746.72] P:1945.72 E:0.098579 |  out wide, Kane's not bothered, he's looking at the ball, three or four steps away from it and waiting
[1746.72 - 1752.88] P:1990.97 E:0.105249 |  for the whistle. Tottenham are one behind tonight, they're two one in front, Kane sticks it away,
[1752.88 - 1756.16] P:1910.21 E:0.110108 |  he scores another penalty, Tottenham two Frankfurt one.
[1757.44 - 1763.52] P:1815.60 E:0.093402 |  Thank you Harry. Rangers one, Liverpool one, the score here at Ibrox, almost half an hour playing
[1764.48 - 1770.32] P:1918.67 E:0.082542 |  and here is Firmino, the man who scored his seventh goal of the season tonight, excellent start of
[1770.32 - 1775.68] P:1878.73 E:0.088371 |  the season, in fact his best start to a season in a gold scoring sense, ball played across Fabinho,
[1775.68 - 1779.84] P:1994.70 E:0.096625 |  bounces back to Caldwellio on the edge of the box, rolls his foot over it, gives it to Timacas,
[1779.84 - 1784.48] P:1982.42 E:0.087836 |  Timacas with the cross, that's headed away by Davis on the edge of his six yard box,
[1784.48 - 1789.28] P:1900.41 E:0.098029 |  chested on the corner of the area by Firmino who's looking to get it back, stretches, tries to lift
[1789.28 - 1794.40] P:1898.12 E:0.087409 |  it across but the ball was already out, you just heard it there, clatter into the metal toast behind
[1794.40 - 1800.40] P:1896.69 E:0.098397 |  the goal, he's gulking. There's great feedback of Allio, just the little roll of the sole, brilliant,
[1801.28 - 1807.92] P:1841.83 E:0.083770 |  little twist of the hips, exciting play for Liverpool for the future, without question.
[1807.92 - 1815.36] P:1851.14 E:0.078829 |  Certainly is Fabio Calvalio, the Portuguese came through with Ben Fica but then the family moved
[1815.36 - 1823.68] P:1881.34 E:0.086514 |  to London and then obviously hit the big time with Fulham and then Liverpool brought him to
[1823.68 - 1830.64] P:1844.91 E:0.086216 |  Anfield for a fee that could be up to something like £7-8 million, something like that.
[1830.64 - 1836.32] P:1861.45 E:0.092094 |  Absolute bargain. But you say they rolled his sole, it actually warmed the sole, didn't it,
[1836.40 - 1840.80] P:1825.24 E:0.082192 |  a little twitch like that. Here's McGregor who clears to the halfway line, Gomez got underneath
[1840.80 - 1845.52] P:1805.24 E:0.094398 |  that, just heads out of play and is to throwing the Rangers halfway inside their own half, we're on
[1845.52 - 1850.96] P:1879.28 E:0.087170 |  air till half past 10 tonight with five live sport, Kelly Cates is here with us at Ibrox tonight
[1851.60 - 1856.32] P:1882.06 E:0.094567 |  and Colin Murray taking over at 10.30 but before that we'll try and bring you some reaction
[1856.88 - 1860.96] P:1774.17 E:0.095926 |  when the managers and the players speak down in the little press room. Did you go in there before
[1860.96 - 1866.80] P:1813.26 E:0.082142 |  the game, very old fashioned press room here downstairs where the ceiling, actually it's a
[1866.80 - 1870.96] P:1737.12 E:0.096958 |  little bit like Alice in Wonderland, the ceiling sort of gets lower as you walk towards the back
[1870.96 - 1876.80] P:1769.02 E:0.082066 |  of the room. My head started scraping on the ceiling. I wonder what that red mark was John.
[1879.68 - 1886.32] P:1863.54 E:0.082479 |  Liverpool take the throw down field and Goldson's able to play it back to McGregor. So Goldson
[1887.12 - 1892.56] P:1876.60 E:0.093526 |  just finds Farnino in front of him so hits the pass, long downfield that that's beyond
[1892.56 - 1897.68] P:1881.67 E:0.098196 |  Sikala and advances through for throwing the Liverpool halfway inside their own half.
[1898.24 - 1903.20] P:1840.42 E:0.086248 |  So one won the score, Scott R Field, super finish, great Champions League moment that wasn't it,
[1903.20 - 1908.24] P:1730.84 E:0.092077 |  when they score that goal, the celebrations, as you ran away, you remember he did one score
[1908.24 - 1915.76] P:1878.74 E:0.081665 |  for Burnley at Anfield against Liverpool, Scott R Field, 34 next month. Yeah it was a beautiful
[1915.76 - 1920.80] P:1886.78 E:0.081251 |  finish. Alison did them a chance of serving it right across the ground, took it in his
[1920.80 - 1929.36] P:1875.95 E:0.077529 |  stride as well, the finish. Both played forward from Davis for Rangers headed away by Van Dijk on
[1929.36 - 1934.40] P:1956.14 E:0.090138 |  the edge of the box and then Fabinho puts in the challenge but Rangers are able to head
[1934.40 - 1941.12] P:1897.28 E:0.093422 |  possession again and Pona Goldson passes it all the way back to go keep McGregor to our right.
[1942.08 - 1949.12] P:1872.68 E:0.093990 |  If we can with all the half an hour played, well once we get an opportunity we're bringing Roddy
[1949.12 - 1957.20] P:1789.98 E:0.077112 |  Forsythe for a word when we can but Rangers in possession inside their own half and the ball
[1957.20 - 1961.84] P:1838.24 E:0.095108 |  is played to the left hand side to Barasic. Barasic looked as though he was going to hit that down
[1961.84 - 1966.00] P:1838.20 E:0.099818 |  field but you know he's gone in field and you can hear the reaction from the supporters behind
[1966.16 - 1971.12] P:1924.05 E:0.087395 |  us. They want their team to be brave tonight and be on the front foot. They feel there,
[1971.84 - 1977.04] P:1871.53 E:0.082753 |  I think that Barasic took the wrong option having been pegged back to 1-1.
[1977.92 - 1982.56] P:1947.34 E:0.090189 |  Goldson does hit a longish pass towards Sacala who flicked it on. Now here's Ryan Jack on the
[1982.56 - 1987.36] P:1969.72 E:0.094556 |  right hand side. Chalak wants it. Jack goes for the early ball right across the edge of the penalty
[1987.36 - 1992.48] P:1979.44 E:0.106761 |  area but Gomez was there and sweeps it behind the far post and Rangers have got their first corner
[1993.04 - 1997.92] P:1915.96 E:0.083059 |  Jonathan. Well as soon as they played forward a bit quicker I'm going to Sacala then they'll cause
[1997.92 - 2001.92] P:1894.83 E:0.086756 |  problems in the good corner from it. Sometimes they're a bit negative in going back and going back
[2002.48 - 2008.08] P:1893.07 E:0.081534 |  they could go forward a lot quicker. In Tottenham's group Marseille now double their lead. Marseille
[2008.08 - 2014.16] P:1874.76 E:0.084610 |  winning 2-0 against 10 man sporting who came into tonight top of the table in that group. Rangers
[2014.16 - 2020.08] P:1875.15 E:0.081026 |  with a corner then from the left hand side so it could be Barasic with the out swinging in fact
[2020.08 - 2024.64] P:1885.75 E:0.089463 |  Kent takes it short and then Barasic swings it across headed away by Canate and he comes out
[2024.64 - 2029.12] P:1909.32 E:0.090902 |  to Carvalho on the edge of the box who controlled it. Cavani had all for Rangers he plays it over the
[2029.12 - 2034.08] P:1989.94 E:0.095561 |  top. Lundstrand on the right hand side drives into the box Lundstrand pulls it across and Liverpool
[2034.08 - 2039.60] P:1945.98 E:0.085940 |  are able to clear through Henderson. Comes out to Barasic again though Barasic to Kent. Kent
[2040.32 - 2045.12] P:1969.49 E:0.094030 |  on the balls of his feet gives it back to Barasic. Whipped cross from Barasic. Chalak got his head
[2045.12 - 2049.76] P:1926.61 E:0.087464 |  to it but that touch took the ball outside of the penalty area. Sacala though takes it up again for
[2049.76 - 2054.96] P:1924.79 E:0.095966 |  Rangers. Sacala against two Liverpool men Fabinho and Nunes is back there as well and Nunes put in
[2054.96 - 2059.76] P:1881.03 E:0.080622 |  the challenge and Sacala lost possession and Liverpool should be able to play it away which
[2059.76 - 2065.28] P:1947.03 E:0.096807 |  they do towards the halfway line but Ball's still in play and Rangers will look to come again
[2065.28 - 2071.04] P:1937.42 E:0.081717 |  10 minutes to go to halftime and Davis will just roll it here to the left hand side the Barasic
[2071.04 - 2076.32] P:1864.03 E:0.089643 |  who just checks back again and you can hear there is that you can hear the reaction that there is
[2076.32 - 2083.92] P:1884.35 E:0.083060 |  that unsettled reaction as Rangers have just eased the break on again inside their own heart.
[2083.92 - 2089.20] P:1972.33 E:0.091450 |  Golten is going to hit that long pass and he does find Kent and those yellow boots control the ball
[2089.20 - 2093.36] P:1931.98 E:0.094183 |  and now Jack with the drive and run into the full back position but the ball bounces through
[2093.36 - 2098.08] P:1948.11 E:0.085511 |  as Canate puts in the challenge and it's a gold kick for Liverpool so let's bring in Ruddy.
[2098.08 - 2101.92] P:1995.26 E:0.097755 |  Ruddy Forsythe for a view on the game. I think we can agree Rangers have regained a degree of
[2101.92 - 2106.88] P:1823.98 E:0.087707 |  respectability in this game but what worries me from their point of view is the fact that
[2106.88 - 2112.56] P:1867.75 E:0.088387 |  they've conceded a goal from a corner kick when they played PSV here in the playoff for the group
[2112.56 - 2117.36] P:1900.21 E:0.097435 |  stage they were twice ahead and twice conceded from corner kicks at that point John McLaughlin
[2117.36 - 2121.12] P:1786.73 E:0.091343 |  was getting the blame for not commanding his defense but tonight it's the 40 year old McGregor
[2121.12 - 2126.00] P:1890.03 E:0.084638 |  who's in charge of the penalty area. Thank you Ruddy. Bristol City nail Preston Nail is the
[2126.00 - 2130.80] P:1896.69 E:0.086080 |  halftime scorer at Ashton Gate and Bayern Munich and now four-nail up Leon Goretzka scored his
[2130.80 - 2137.60] P:1773.21 E:0.080492 |  second of the match so Victoria puts a nil Bayern Munich four so Bayern Munich will make it 12 points
[2137.60 - 2143.92] P:1919.26 E:0.097468 |  out of 12 tonight. Here is Davis who does well and the pressure plays the ball back to McGregor
[2144.96 - 2150.80] P:1888.16 E:0.096510 |  so Rangers tonight at least have got off the mark in terms of goals in this group so they will not
[2150.80 - 2158.80] P:1927.50 E:0.092376 |  become the second team to fail to win a point or score a goal in a Champions League group
[2159.76 - 2168.80] P:1914.83 E:0.090206 |  this season it was Maccabi Haifan who have that dubious privilege Rangers coming forward
[2168.80 - 2173.92] P:1877.57 E:0.085843 |  when a free kick over on the right hand side, Sacala was being wrestled by Simicast.
[2173.92 - 2180.96] P:1919.07 E:0.085623 |  Canton, Sacala can definitely get a Gomez and Simicast there's a weakness there and
[2180.96 - 2184.88] P:1922.36 E:0.093603 |  they're on the way if they just play forward a little bit more quicker Rangers and getting behind
[2185.84 - 2189.92] P:1907.95 E:0.092730 |  is a big advantage in that area. Here's the free kick then four Rangers and it comes towards the
[2189.92 - 2195.20] P:1934.89 E:0.086475 |  penalty spot it's headed away it comes out Davis on the edge of the box four Rangers back to Jack
[2195.20 - 2200.48] P:1840.02 E:0.085894 |  and then rather belatedly the the offside flag goes up in there and it's a free kick to Liverpool
[2200.48 - 2208.32] P:1873.56 E:0.087172 |  on the edge of their own box by a Liverpool equalised against Porto so that is 1-1 and Liverpool
[2208.96 - 2213.60] P:1872.61 E:0.091996 |  have this free kick on the edge of their own penalty area so around about eight minutes to go
[2213.60 - 2221.92] P:1877.11 E:0.080388 |  plus added time to the break it's been enjoyable and it is all square and the referee says he
[2221.92 - 2227.52] P:1857.00 E:0.081666 |  wants Liverpool to take that free kick again and there is a potential penalty check taking place
[2228.48 - 2236.72] P:1956.56 E:0.096870 |  the check is over that was quick still it was dramatic while it lasted as Canate is
[2236.72 - 2242.16] P:1875.93 E:0.087048 |  felled by Cholak 15 yards inside his own heart that by a labour Cousin goal has been disallowed
[2242.72 - 2249.20] P:1926.59 E:0.086080 |  the air all over the place so that is still labour Cousin 0 Porto 1 5 live radio Merseyside
[2249.20 - 2253.28] P:1915.08 E:0.095829 |  and BBC sounds as Liverpool attack down the left hand side and the ball bounces out of play off
[2253.28 - 2257.52] P:1906.99 E:0.084807 |  Cavalio through throw that Tabbania takes quickly towards the collar on the halfway line
[2257.52 - 2263.44] P:1902.41 E:0.096227 |  Cavalio is quickly backing on that and now Liverpool will play through Fabinho all the way back
[2264.00 - 2270.48] P:1943.07 E:0.100999 |  to Alisson who passes at the knee check the out to Van Dyke and another goal at Tottenham Alistair
[2271.20 - 2274.32] P:1956.47 E:0.106459 |  10 minutes to half time Tottenham have a third as the great Jimmy
[2274.32 - 2279.76] P:1881.29 E:0.114696 |  on field used to say son of score with what I like to call a thumping volley wonderful
[2279.76 - 2285.76] P:1903.16 E:0.092063 |  strike with his left foot Tottenham 3 Frankfurt 1 thank you Ali you might have been right behind
[2285.76 - 2292.32] P:1878.61 E:0.084135 |  that I don't know Rangers 1 Liverpool 1 and offside flag is up against Liverpool free kick
[2292.88 - 2299.12] P:1888.67 E:0.087165 |  for Rangers 10 yards inside their own heart so so one won the score it's whizzed by Jonathan
[2299.12 - 2303.44] P:1869.46 E:0.082422 |  this first half wasn't it? Jordan's been a good game it has been a good game range of
[2304.24 - 2308.88] P:1835.51 E:0.081310 |  coming to wake up the first goal but the Liverpool reply about it is a good game good technical
[2308.88 - 2315.20] P:1758.39 E:0.084267 |  game tactical game. The Greg at clearing from inside his penalty area to Arfield who passes it
[2315.20 - 2323.20] P:1831.38 E:0.087703 |  back to Barasic who gets it down and Barasic passes the ball forward and Arfield is beaten by
[2323.20 - 2327.68] P:1819.13 E:0.090103 |  Henderson and Liverpool come forward Gomez not seeing very much of that at all Gomez getting
[2327.76 - 2331.84] P:1956.53 E:0.093230 |  forward down the right hand side but he is now deep into the full back position here's the cross
[2331.84 - 2337.68] P:1955.81 E:0.088797 |  only half cleared away comes out to Fabinho 25 yards from goal little pass to Elliott Elliott
[2337.68 - 2342.40] P:1887.56 E:0.086720 |  threads it back through to Cavalio but Rangers are able to clear it through Lundström on the edge of
[2342.40 - 2351.12] P:1858.16 E:0.086834 |  his box Van Dijk form a Celtic man hence the boobs and then Firmino towards Cavalio very busy
[2351.12 - 2359.92] P:1922.23 E:0.085646 |  little figure Elliott then back again to Fabinho Fabinho to Henderson Fabinho just nipped in ahead
[2359.92 - 2365.44] P:1821.89 E:0.087677 |  of the referee to keep possession for Liverpool now Gomez on the right hand side Liverpool suddenly
[2365.44 - 2371.44] P:1816.81 E:0.094723 |  parked inside the range as hard Jürgen Klopp stands watching with his hands clasped behind his back
[2372.96 - 2377.84] P:1873.85 E:0.089844 |  and Liverpool go all the way back to goalkeeper Allison again start once more through the middle
[2377.84 - 2382.32] P:1981.19 E:0.108624 |  Cavalio is beaten to it by Lundström and now Lundström forward to Trollak who's on the right
[2382.32 - 2387.60] P:1988.34 E:0.091325 |  hand side Kent's trying to get there in the middle but Trollak's passes to her right across the front
[2387.60 - 2393.44] P:1883.31 E:0.089470 |  of of Kent who made the right run but the delivery from Trollak wasn't nearly good enough just
[2393.44 - 2396.88] P:1777.47 E:0.106977 |  lacked a little bit of quality but when the brook fair range is the brook at real pace
[2398.40 - 2403.44] P:1895.14 E:0.085656 |  if the ball was better to be fair can I it does well just to max that run just sees him
[2404.16 - 2409.84] P:1826.31 E:0.080088 |  and the ball's out for throwing to Liverpool in their own right back position so one one the
[2409.84 - 2415.68] P:1865.13 E:0.091943 |  Rangers fans behind where Gomez is taking this throw down in the corner are all jumping up
[2415.68 - 2419.76] P:1899.44 E:0.089757 |  and down bouncing up and down together they have not stopped since the start of the game
[2419.76 - 2424.72] P:1805.56 E:0.089599 |  I think they barely stopped when Rangers scored the goal and they didn't stop when Liverpool scored
[2424.72 - 2430.56] P:1848.31 E:0.080387 |  theirs as McGregor hits this downfield headed forward by Fabinho comes back to Goldson takes
[2430.64 - 2436.08] P:1919.98 E:0.107468 |  touch and then just bozzers it downfield Kent is onto this Kent gets the ball down he's running
[2436.08 - 2440.48] P:1923.85 E:0.100140 |  at Gomez Kent into the penalty area back onto his right foot shoots it takes a deflection off the
[2441.44 - 2445.92] P:1983.67 E:0.107166 |  off the carbs of Canardane is behind in the corner Canard it does well
[2447.68 - 2452.96] P:1923.17 E:0.090331 |  to get across and block that he's played well Canardane he's looked really strong decisive in
[2452.96 - 2457.84] P:1889.78 E:0.085813 |  his defending knows what he wants to do made some good blocks some good headers
[2457.84 - 2463.68] P:1863.77 E:0.079164 |  and this one is going to be taken by Barasic left footed out swing out that is down in that corner
[2463.68 - 2469.44] P:1840.35 E:0.081226 |  where all of the noise is coming out of clapping their hands in unison Barasic on the pitch here's
[2469.44 - 2474.00] P:1855.98 E:0.092640 |  the corner which is headed away by Canardane did well good up very high above everyone else to
[2474.00 - 2481.04] P:1903.60 E:0.085427 |  head it away for Liverpool Barasic as Rangers come again Kent lovely little swivel of the hips from
[2481.60 - 2486.88] P:1883.95 E:0.088333 |  Ryan Kent Rangers still in possession Davis back on the halfway line four minutes to the
[2486.88 - 2492.72] P:1916.81 E:0.095091 |  halftime whistle plus added time now Saqala on the right hand side takes on Simicast and beats him
[2492.72 - 2496.96] P:1967.63 E:0.106156 |  and Saqala now pulls it across after he'll regain with a chance but that's blocked on the edge of
[2496.96 - 2502.16] P:1956.84 E:0.100476 |  the six yard box and Liverpool are able to get it away well played Saqala but here's Nunes at the
[2502.16 - 2508.88] P:1961.33 E:0.088374 |  other end a crucial touch from Goldson just took it away from Darwin Nunes and Goldson actually
[2508.88 - 2513.44] P:1916.24 E:0.086040 |  is taking a knock in there as well so there'll be a little stopping Saqala was sharp so sharp
[2514.40 - 2523.04] P:1920.69 E:0.078158 |  when past Simicast 1v1 pace power electrifying but what a block from Canardane has stopped that
[2523.04 - 2528.80] P:1852.03 E:0.077027 |  from going in the goal what a block he's been magnificent in this first half Canardane
[2529.44 - 2537.76] P:1930.31 E:0.080712 |  it was a chance for for our field but his shot was was blocked and and Goldson could have a problem
[2537.76 - 2542.24] P:1874.59 E:0.085278 |  and actually there's a potential penalty check as well another potential penalty check but that's
[2542.24 - 2548.80] P:1864.71 E:0.072970 |  quickly finished that checks over so I think Conagolson be coming off it looks like a that's a
[2548.80 - 2553.20] P:1854.24 E:0.087752 |  problem looks like a thigh strain I've had plenty of them in my career but he does look like one
[2553.20 - 2557.44] P:1760.59 E:0.084236 |  he did he immediately he clutched the top of his thigh didn't he and and that does not look good
[2557.44 - 2566.80] P:1866.61 E:0.075053 |  for Conagolson he's an important part of this van Broncoest Rangers team he started 17 of the 18
[2566.80 - 2572.56] P:1807.07 E:0.082490 |  matches they've played this season Conagolson and so as I said James Sands is there on the
[2572.56 - 2576.88] P:1935.34 E:0.088203 |  substitute bench there's the youngster as well of course Leon King the very highly rated youngster
[2576.88 - 2581.28] P:1873.96 E:0.085626 |  I don't know whether you've seen much of him other than the match last week but they're they are
[2581.28 - 2586.08] P:1911.10 E:0.080669 |  talking very glowingly about what he might be able to do in the game yeah I spoke to a to a few
[2586.08 - 2591.20] P:1915.58 E:0.075891 |  people about them they said how good he was and he's got a great future ahead hopefully he keeps an
[2591.20 - 2597.28] P:1869.90 E:0.061886 |  improving progressing you know for young kids these days it's okay to get the chance but can they
[2597.28 - 2602.08] P:1839.69 E:0.079040 |  keep on pushing on can they keep that hunger inside them to go to the next level not just happy
[2602.08 - 2606.72] P:1901.19 E:0.088993 |  with what they have at the minute. Rangers 1 Liverpool 1 it is a red button night tonight
[2606.72 - 2610.88] P:1852.39 E:0.086559 |  by the way you can listen to our commentary alongside the final score graphics and the video
[2610.88 - 2616.96] P:1821.24 E:0.087551 |  print it you just press the red button or you you can go to iPlayer or the BBC sport app and click
[2616.96 - 2623.68] P:1944.75 E:0.096341 |  on five by final score and Barcelona have scored in that big game for them against Inter so Barcelona
[2623.68 - 2631.60] P:1738.93 E:0.077212 |  won Inter at 0, Usman D'Ambelli with the goal and here's Roddy King is coming on King is coming on
[2631.60 - 2644.24] P:1967.42 E:0.092574 |  to play in the back four so Goldson that is it and Leon King has been prepared the 18 year old
[2644.96 - 2652.80] P:1985.21 E:0.094714 |  Glaswegian born here in the city this is will be only his 18th first team appearance. I was going
[2652.80 - 2656.96] P:1890.82 E:0.107627 |  to say if Jonathan if you haven't seen him much one of the things that Rangers like about him is
[2656.96 - 2661.44] P:1903.38 E:0.101911 |  that when he brings the ball out of the box he's a good passer generally speaking a good controller
[2661.44 - 2666.56] P:1955.20 E:0.088631 |  of the ball. That's a bonus for us at the back now if you can pass through a line and look at the
[2666.56 - 2673.44] P:1934.14 E:0.094970 |  stash on him. Conceited the penalty last week at Anfield who's a little unfortunate Liverpool
[2673.44 - 2678.72] P:1922.00 E:0.097836 |  were all over him at the time but you learn from those experiences. He'll have an opportunity
[2678.72 - 2681.92] P:1967.69 E:0.110428 |  now to stay in the team because Conor Bowles are coming off of the fast during normally take
[2682.88 - 2686.80] P:1922.16 E:0.110467 |  three to six weeks sometimes longer. So here he comes.
[2694.08 - 2698.00] P:2023.31 E:0.099349 |  Take care for him looking a little nervous as he was on the side of the pitch just clapping his
[2698.00 - 2702.48] P:1821.65 E:0.093362 |  hands Roddy. By the way that also means that Rangers have lost their principal target for set pieces
[2702.48 - 2711.60] P:1929.62 E:0.087633 |  in the Liverpool box. Goldson is usually the man they aim for. So Rangers won Liverpool won and Rangers
[2712.16 - 2717.04] P:1904.48 E:0.097314 |  losing Conor Goldson they've not had much luck with Rangers with injuries Rangers this season
[2717.04 - 2722.80] P:1840.30 E:0.089646 |  particularly in me in the central defensive area as well. Hellender is still out John Souter had
[2722.80 - 2730.40] P:1831.63 E:0.080937 |  an ankle operation and now Conor Goldson is out and Rangers go to Motherwell at the weekend.
[2731.20 - 2737.44] P:1950.49 E:0.104928 |  Here is Jack but Jack is a judge to have fouled Fabinho and the referee has blown the whistle
[2737.44 - 2742.08] P:1892.00 E:0.079312 |  and brought it back for a free kick when Jack thought he might be away through towards the
[2742.08 - 2749.28] P:1941.61 E:0.067873 |  edge of the penalty area. So one won the score added time at the end of the first half. Three minutes
[2749.28 - 2758.24] P:1955.43 E:0.066133 |  have been added on and Fabinho forward towards the Liverpool goal scorer Roberto Firmino
[2760.88 - 2766.40] P:2012.34 E:0.096078 |  and then Gomez trying to find a way through between two Rangers men which he has good strong play
[2766.40 - 2772.88] P:1954.98 E:0.080747 |  from Gomez and then Firmino to Cavalio. Cavalio now is forced from left to right but Harvey Elliott
[2772.88 - 2777.12] P:1945.51 E:0.085430 |  is there. Elliott goes back in field towards Henderson. Henderson square first time touch
[2777.12 - 2781.76] P:1949.94 E:0.084917 |  lovely from Fabinho. Now Timmacass on the left hand side Timmacass with the early cross but
[2781.76 - 2785.12] P:2021.99 E:0.090992 |  McGregor is able to go down quite comfortably and catch the ball on the edge of the pitch.
[2785.12 - 2788.88] P:1939.30 E:0.083185 |  Past Fabinho there wasn't it knew what was around him.
[2790.88 - 2798.24] P:1945.69 E:0.074696 |  Great, great pass, great weight. Yeah lovely touch. So one one here still Tottenham leading
[2798.24 - 2805.76] P:1926.69 E:0.086249 |  Eintracht Frankfurt. Three one having gone behind and early at Napoli made it four wins out of four
[2805.76 - 2813.12] P:1896.26 E:0.081805 |  in this group with another goal filled match for two the final score against Ajax in the
[2813.68 - 2819.76] P:1965.34 E:0.095917 |  and the Diego Maradona stadium. Cavalio on the halfway line turns the ball to his left,
[2819.76 - 2825.84] P:1992.41 E:0.089389 |  Nunes takes on King, beats him and then Nunes flights the ball over the top but Elliott can't
[2825.84 - 2831.36] P:1948.06 E:0.080572 |  reach that. He let it drift over his head and it just caught the surface and bounced the way through
[2831.36 - 2836.00] P:1909.78 E:0.083045 |  for a goal. They're always difficult balls to control. I like that about King. He tried to bring
[2836.00 - 2840.96] P:1831.26 E:0.072248 |  it down his chest and try to play. He made a little mistake but that's the life of being a
[2841.04 - 2844.00] P:1829.61 E:0.087790 |  center half. His decision making but he didn't the right thing. It was just a bit too big.
[2845.12 - 2848.64] P:1722.38 E:0.093559 |  But I like that and center half try to bring it down instead of just heading it
[2849.28 - 2852.00] P:1762.15 E:0.091444 |  in in Evernor. It's going to go. Try and bring it down your chest and play.
[2853.12 - 2858.88] P:1860.49 E:0.085296 |  Jonathan Woodgate with us here at Ibrox on the on the gantry at the front of the top tier of the
[2858.88 - 2864.96] P:1903.06 E:0.086026 |  Bilstruth stand. I actually saw Bilstruth's old walking stick which was in the old manager's
[2864.96 - 2871.76] P:1906.01 E:0.076813 |  office yesterday. He has Nunes who wins a free kick on the halfway line. Henderson waiting to
[2871.76 - 2878.64] P:1903.99 E:0.079879 |  take this. It's a real old farmer's style walking stick with a glazed sheep's horn for the head of
[2878.64 - 2886.00] P:1913.67 E:0.082066 |  it. I could do one at the miniature. Back's not in great form. As you pointed out earlier,
[2886.00 - 2892.96] P:1894.08 E:0.087724 |  not for the first time in your career. Only the last. Van Dyke, long pass forward which is headed
[2892.96 - 2899.20] P:1926.95 E:0.091239 |  away by Barrisic. First half is almost done. In fact, the first half is done and that's been
[2899.20 - 2904.72] P:2026.63 E:0.096060 |  entertaining. One one, Jonathan. It's been a really good, really good first half there. Rangers
[2904.72 - 2909.28] P:1910.18 E:0.093626 |  started quietly but then got into the game. A good goal which they deserve downfield running off the
[2909.28 - 2914.72] P:1908.68 E:0.088414 |  back of Fabinho but then they'll be disappointed Rangers that Liverpool come back in so quickly
[2914.72 - 2920.64] P:1835.36 E:0.088249 |  with a with a Femenio header which being a good game to 50-50 game now this in go either way.
[2921.20 - 2927.36] P:1948.51 E:0.085666 |  So yes, our field for Rangers their first goal in this group stage, their first goal in a Champions
[2927.36 - 2932.80] P:1948.87 E:0.096599 |  League group for 12 years. Scott Arfield scoring it but Femenio equalising with a header from the
[2932.80 - 2938.96] P:1885.93 E:0.092258 |  Sumitcast corner seven minutes later and at the break it's Rangers one, Liverpool one and with
[2938.96 - 2945.04] P:1950.34 E:0.085595 |  us here on the gantry shoulder to shoulder with us Kelly Cates. It is something of a tight squeeze
[2945.04 - 2948.72] P:1841.21 E:0.098158 |  but it's all right because we all know each other. John Murray and Jonathan Woodgate back for the
[2949.28 - 2953.84] P:1723.26 E:0.096002 |  second half of this game at Ibrox. It's one all as John said at halftime. Ruddy Poseid also
[2953.84 - 2959.28] P:1782.77 E:0.093429 |  alongside me and Ruddy has been much better from Rangers and what we saw at Anfield and they did
[2959.28 - 2964.72] P:1904.03 E:0.091959 |  exactly what you wanted them to do which is be brave. Well I was having a look at the stats halfway
[2964.72 - 2969.60] P:1883.34 E:0.101684 |  through the first half and at that point in the first game Liverpool had hit the 80% possession
[2969.60 - 2974.72] P:1893.49 E:0.098008 |  mark. This time Rangers were ahead not much 52% but even so it represented a huge difference in the
[2974.80 - 2979.52] P:1903.62 E:0.095706 |  way the game was unfolding and at that point incidentally a week ago you'll remember that
[2979.52 - 2984.16] P:1888.96 E:0.088558 |  Alan McGregor had had to make three big saves. He scarcely had to touch the ball this evening so
[2984.16 - 2988.72] P:1872.31 E:0.096846 |  from that point of view Rangers will feel comfortable but not overconfident I should imagine in the
[2988.72 - 2993.44] P:1787.91 E:0.101289 |  dressing room. Yeah very finely balanced at the moment. Brad Friedel is also with us Brad what
[2993.44 - 2998.64] P:1757.36 E:0.088432 |  were your thoughts on that that first half? Yeah it's been an even game. It's a good game to watch
[2998.64 - 3004.00] P:1732.10 E:0.087640 |  for the neutral I would imagine. Rangers are far more competitive than they were when they went to
[3004.48 - 3009.76] P:1765.39 E:0.085863 |  went to Anfield. They had another really good chance at Canada I believe it was the one who made
[3009.76 - 3016.16] P:1765.07 E:0.085509 |  it a vital block. I think it was a fairly soft goal for Rangers to concede they'll probably be
[3016.16 - 3023.36] P:1732.67 E:0.086145 |  disappointed with that. I would imagine in the second half time being at 1-1 we'll see a
[3024.08 - 3028.32] P:1677.36 E:0.095800 |  a little bit improved Liverpool side but right now this match is entirely in the balance.
[3028.80 - 3033.36] P:1828.37 E:0.078830 |  Jonathan it doesn't look like anything that we don't know about these two teams that we've seen
[3033.36 - 3038.00] P:1838.50 E:0.073244 |  out here on the pitch but what can we expect in the in the second half of this one? Both managers
[3038.00 - 3042.08] P:1852.44 E:0.082962 |  were saying they want to win the game they can make changes off the off the bench Salah can come
[3042.08 - 3047.44] P:1860.49 E:0.083795 |  up for Liverpool and make a real difference but both teams want to win so I'm expecting to see
[3048.00 - 3053.12] P:1876.75 E:0.077448 |  more goals both teams won't be happy with the draw. One all then a half time at Ibrics it's
[3053.68 - 3058.80] P:1722.02 E:0.085734 |  Rangers 1 Liverpool 1 Brad Fielder will be back with us at full time in this game.
[3058.80 - 3063.04] P:1810.08 E:0.096026 |  I've already precise Jonathan Wood getting John Murray here on the gantry at Ibrics.
[3063.04 - 3067.20] P:1891.17 E:0.094781 |  It's half time between Tottenham and Eintracht Frankfurt. Alistair Bruce Ball is watching this
[3067.20 - 3072.48] P:2025.57 E:0.095708 |  for us and after a shaky start it's been all Tottenham Alley. Yes well put Kelly all smiles
[3072.48 - 3076.32] P:1967.39 E:0.101141 |  and joy at half time Tottenham leading Eintracht Frankfurt by three goals to one I can see that
[3076.32 - 3080.72] P:2027.28 E:0.093947 |  Marseille are two nil up a way to sporting this evening so Tottenham as it stands at half time
[3080.72 - 3086.32] P:2026.51 E:0.096139 |  actually leading the group. Not so convincing at the start the goal they gave away came in the
[3086.32 - 3091.04] P:1940.70 E:0.092744 |  14th minute playing out from the back loose touch from Eric Dyer it ended up in the back of the
[3091.04 - 3097.04] P:2012.38 E:0.091382 |  Tottenham net Daiichi Kamada the Japanese international scored the goal and Tottenham again just struggling
[3097.04 - 3103.04] P:1989.33 E:0.093837 |  to get going it went to the old combination the Kane and Son link up that got them back in the
[3103.04 - 3107.76] P:1998.51 E:0.099520 |  game just six minutes after they conceded lovely pass from Harry Kane to release Son from the
[3107.76 - 3112.88] P:1940.06 E:0.100331 |  halfway line he made no mistake with the finish eight minutes later Kane won a penalty via a
[3112.88 - 3117.44] P:1904.16 E:0.099222 |  VAR review I'm not quite sure how the referee didn't see it in real time it looked fairly
[3117.44 - 3122.08] P:1884.07 E:0.096616 |  obvious to everyone inside the stadium but he was sent over to the monitor came back out pointed
[3122.08 - 3126.56] P:1885.02 E:0.098227 |  to the spot and Harry Kane as he so often does stuck it away and then they saved the best till
[3126.56 - 3133.20] P:1974.29 E:0.097513 |  last Son's thumping left foot volley to make it 3-1 it's Hoibieg's cross from the right and Son met
[3133.20 - 3138.48] P:1967.50 E:0.097815 |  it so sweetly almost took the net off he very nearly had a hat trick late in the first half as
[3138.48 - 3142.80] P:1874.36 E:0.093084 |  well so Tottenham well on top they're leading Frankfurt by three goals to one Ali thank you very
[3142.80 - 3147.44] P:1767.00 E:0.098605 |  much for that that part of a busy evening of Champions League football and a busy night for our
[3147.44 - 3153.28] P:1699.50 E:0.097812 |  football reporter John Bennett John is a big 45 coming up for Barcelona yes so far so good for
[3153.28 - 3158.40] P:1662.01 E:0.097686 |  Barca thrilling first half of the new camp Barca no if they lose tonight they crash out of the
[3158.40 - 3163.60] P:1617.08 E:0.102826 |  Champions League but they have the lead against Inter Barcelona won Inter Neal Usman Dembele with
[3163.60 - 3170.40] P:1804.40 E:0.095290 |  the goal from close range just before halftime great work by Raphinha and Sergei Roberto to set him up
[3170.40 - 3175.76] P:1686.81 E:0.098438 |  but Barca do deserve it they've been the better side but Inter's Eddin Jekko hit the bar earlier in
[3175.76 - 3181.68] P:1764.88 E:0.096137 |  the game and the ball bounced on the line so they got a bit lucky there if Barca win by two goals
[3181.68 - 3187.20] P:1693.79 E:0.089472 |  they'd move above Inter it's Barcelona won Inter Neal and John for Club Rouge they've made history
[3187.20 - 3192.24] P:1591.64 E:0.100261 |  this evening yes they've booked a place in the last 16 for the first time since the modern format
[3192.24 - 3197.04] P:1632.05 E:0.098630 |  of the Champions League was introduced and Neil Neil draw against Atletico Madrid was enough
[3197.04 - 3203.28] P:1707.30 E:0.096695 |  to book their spot great performance particularly by Sima Minule in goal they'd have nine attempts
[3203.28 - 3207.76] P:1649.84 E:0.097294 |  to make it out of the groups before they've never done it they have now only the second Belgian team
[3207.76 - 3212.80] P:1741.14 E:0.090876 |  to reach the last 16 of the Champions League in the same group at halftime it's Balevaques and Neal
[3212.80 - 3218.48] P:1759.41 E:0.095182 |  Porto won Javi Alonso's debut as a Champions League manager they're unfortunate Balevaques and
[3218.48 - 3222.96] P:1719.86 E:0.094072 |  they missed a penalty and had a goal disallowed and as Ali mentioned in Tottenham's group it's
[3222.96 - 3228.16] P:1886.66 E:0.094298 |  sporting Neal Marseille two the goals for two former Premier League players Matteo Guendouzi

[3691.20 - 3696.40] P:1882.92 E:0.086004 |  in his place the 18 year olds who play that anfield but it's an opportunity there for liverpool's
[3696.40 - 3701.44] P:1967.70 E:0.080670 |  what at times sort of front three or three forward players if you like there's cavalli is in there
[3701.44 - 3706.56] P:1896.57 E:0.093960 |  nunyes is in there but there's the experience of reberto femeno and ian says on social media femeno's
[3706.56 - 3711.28] P:1859.79 E:0.089910 |  having one of those just give the ball to bobby games he said he loves that man how impressed have

[3715.84 - 3721.04] P:1647.15 E:0.082958 |  very comfortable very confident he's a skillful player i think cavalli's i wouldn't say struggled
[3721.04 - 3727.76] P:1586.93 E:0.077558 |  is a harsh word but it you know he lost the ball in the goal and he's um he's found the physicality
[3727.76 - 3733.44] P:1671.57 E:0.081407 |  a little bit difficult for menos ben uh been liverpool's best player especially going going
[3733.44 - 3738.48] P:1608.96 E:0.080878 |  forward uh scored the goal i think you'd question the defending on the goal but yeah he's he's an
[3738.48 - 3743.36] P:1579.10 E:0.085452 |  important piece to this and with a new with a young inexperienced defender i'm sure he's going to try
[3743.36 - 3748.80] P:1544.47 E:0.086070 |  to expose that and i think rangers on the on the other hand are going to try to expose uh gomez
[3748.80 - 3753.76] P:1678.01 E:0.075592 |  a little bit more in the uh in the right back position for liverpool what have you made of
[3753.76 - 3759.04] P:1747.74 E:0.099062 |  darwin nunyes who've managed to to get a few appearances in a row together for liverpool
[3759.04 - 3763.84] P:1850.36 E:0.086524 |  it's start interrupted obviously by the red card that you got early on in in the season what what
[3763.84 - 3770.00] P:1801.31 E:0.077271 |  do you thought of him tonight when when players come into the premier league some players just hit
[3770.00 - 3775.92] P:1541.50 E:0.086279 |  the ground running and uh and some even though it doesn't matter sometimes how good they are how good
[3775.92 - 3780.08] P:1759.27 E:0.080019 |  they turn out in the premier league it just takes them a little bit of time to get used to the league
[3780.08 - 3786.80] P:1622.59 E:0.081075 |  far too early to make uh decisions on him but it's taking him a little bit more more time to get
[3786.80 - 3791.92] P:1609.23 E:0.078902 |  flowing i think uh it's a bit unfair that when they first came in a lot of people were comparing them
[3792.48 - 3797.92] P:1597.61 E:0.085890 |  to holland or to as you can see completely different players and holland can't stop scoring and
[3797.92 - 3804.24] P:1581.81 E:0.079609 |  nunyes needs to find his feet i think uh jürgen klopp very rarely gets signed in is wrong so i'm
[3804.24 - 3809.76] P:1593.69 E:0.079773 |  sure we're we're gonna see the uh the best so to speak the best is yet to come of nunyes um

[3816.96 - 3821.36] P:1763.22 E:0.087654 |  good player in there no doubt we've seen it that's why liverpool signed them so let's hope for liverpool
[3821.36 - 3826.64] P:1867.17 E:0.096506 |  that he can uh he can start the fire brad for now thank you very much brad for you the lsback with us
[3826.64 - 3832.64] P:1937.12 E:0.094818 |  at full time in this game here at ibrics but taking you through the second half is jonathan woodgate

[3851.92 - 3857.68] P:2148.82 E:0.098411 |  jordan henderson just chained up his teammates no further changes at the break so rangers having
[3857.68 - 3863.60] P:2146.91 E:0.091455 |  made that change that uh that we mentioned migregor in goal tavernier substitute king
[3863.60 - 3871.92] P:2125.71 E:0.088738 |  davis and barisic jack and lundstram sakala arfield kent and cholak and liverpool with

[3879.52 - 3886.24] P:1815.86 E:0.085857 |  then elliot mainly on the right carvalho mainly on the left and femeno and nunyes as the uh the
[3886.24 - 3890.72] P:1881.84 E:0.088573 |  frontman in the middle but it is quite fluid as jonathan woodgate was saying in the first half
[3890.72 - 3896.56] P:1868.41 E:0.090437 |  jonathan woodgate former england defender is here with us at ibrics second half underway and liverpool
[3896.56 - 3902.56] P:1844.22 E:0.084647 |  already a long throw his liverpool play from right to left as we look in our excellent position
[3902.56 - 3909.84] P:1880.21 E:0.081200 |  very close to the pitch uh but rangers have the ball back inside their own half and uh and it is
[3909.84 - 3915.12] P:1821.57 E:0.087006 |  leon king who brings it forward but then as nunyes comes across turns it back to uh to gulki but
[3915.12 - 3917.92] P:1876.17 E:0.089428 |  migregor so what do you think what do you think second half jonathan
[3919.52 - 3924.56] P:1638.56 E:0.099834 |  said earlier both team need to win the game they have to win the liverpool want to win the game so
[3924.56 - 3928.48] P:1738.61 E:0.089235 |  they're off in the group and to start that mentality again and rangers want to prove
[3928.48 - 3934.64] P:1880.53 E:0.099725 |  they don't play at this level uh sakala just tackling back and catching simikas the ball
[3934.64 - 3938.24] P:1787.76 E:0.090564 |  bounced up to sort of shoulder height didn't it he put the challenge in coating the man
[3938.24 - 3941.76] P:1645.36 E:0.096142 |  three kick to liverpool it's also arranged that if they get the ball down the sides of the two
[3941.84 - 3945.44] P:1753.46 E:0.093019 |  liverpool full backs they'll cause them problems as they showed in the first half with ken and
[3945.44 - 3950.40] P:1581.12 E:0.087536 |  sa sakala they were really aggressive at times and need to do that more in the second half
[3950.40 - 3955.28] P:1824.15 E:0.096487 |  yep simikas has done pretty well actually this is the fifth match in the row that he started
[3955.28 - 3959.28] P:1890.76 E:0.093992 |  well uh andy robertson's being out the robertson is on the substitutes bench tonight so it'll be
[3959.28 - 3964.48] P:1868.63 E:0.092258 |  interesting to see if we see him tonight with manchester city on sunday in mind salar on the
[3964.48 - 3971.36] P:1884.66 E:0.092619 |  bench as well tiago as liverpool have it centrally and here is jon henderson henderson short pass to
[3971.36 - 3976.64] P:1726.27 E:0.090614 |  femeno femeno is able to move to his left might have just been caught there by lun stramp but was
[3976.64 - 3981.52] P:1865.64 E:0.096916 |  able to find the pass to carvalho plenty of tricks from carvalho he's beaten tavernier he's beaten
[3981.52 - 3986.32] P:1917.97 E:0.103334 |  sakala and now femeno gives it to elliott and elliott works it to the right to colmers who's
[3986.32 - 3992.88] P:1970.23 E:0.094825 |  arriving and shooting into the legs of davis and the ball bounces away for rangers the awareness
[3992.88 - 3997.36] P:1940.27 E:0.089396 |  of femeno he must have had he must have eyes in the back of his head he's just constantly
[3997.36 - 4004.32] P:1923.13 E:0.088542 |  head on the swivel looking around he knows the tick jake and see it outstanding player movement
[4004.32 - 4009.44] P:1954.87 E:0.087144 |  we had a great view of that didn't we in that as you've met here is femeno again femeno playing
[4009.44 - 4014.00] P:2040.38 E:0.090491 |  at square on the edge of the box elliott gets it down and shoots but he shoots straight into
[4014.56 - 4019.04] P:2010.74 E:0.106418 |  barrisage liverpool again though they're they're really cranking up the pressure on rangers here
[4019.04 - 4023.60] P:1953.08 E:0.100464 |  in the early moments of the second half elliott oh lovely round lun stramp and he was caught lun
[4024.08 - 4031.84] P:1925.96 E:0.086557 |  here he'd been beaten and just caught him down went elliott free kick to liverpool right of centre
[4031.84 - 4036.32] P:1850.19 E:0.086197 |  just a bit too quick there elliott wasn't he once i'm just lunging at him but we were saying earlier
[4036.32 - 4040.32] P:1850.97 E:0.080954 |  there john about femeno you saw that bit of movement that's called opposite movement so he
[4040.32 - 4045.60] P:1868.95 E:0.077065 |  goes one way then he comes the other brilliant bit of movement wasn't just to see it how like sharp it
[4045.60 - 4050.96] P:1831.62 E:0.088357 |  was but in the same way so clear to see it fantastic there and the earlier in the past to
[4051.04 - 4056.48] P:1841.19 E:0.095153 |  to gomez as well stonathan says you know we could see that he was not looking just expected gomez
[4056.48 - 4061.60] P:1859.44 E:0.096012 |  to arrive which he did gomez's shot was bought he's never scored for liverpool gomez free kick
[4061.60 - 4068.16] P:1837.47 E:0.096887 |  bill this is uh this is quite quite an acute angle over towards the right hand side so uh

[4102.16 - 4107.76] P:1976.88 E:0.107267 |  but he's absolutely ballooned it high over the top of the wall never threatened the goal never
[4107.76 - 4113.04] P:1872.20 E:0.090832 |  threatened to threaten the goal and it was into the uh lower tier of the brunelands stand to our

[4144.48 - 4149.60] P:1875.94 E:0.095298 |  champions league group since kenny miller who is here tonight here's sycala sycala moving in field
[4149.68 - 4154.80] P:1952.52 E:0.092216 |  might have been fouled but it was taken up by jack who gives it to tavernier and tavernier's cross
[4154.80 - 4160.40] P:1983.30 E:0.091976 |  towards the back post is headed down jack very nearly got there but van dyke did and was able
[4160.40 - 4166.88] P:1993.43 E:0.094620 |  to clear it away inside the six yard box that's rangers best moment so far of the second half
[4168.40 - 4175.60] P:1926.65 E:0.092919 |  and you can hear what effect that has had on the the almost 50 000 rangers fans there are 2600
[4175.60 - 4181.92] P:1984.63 E:0.095427 |  liverpool fans in the corner on the opposite side away to our left dry night and we can see the moon

[4196.80 - 4202.40] P:1803.42 E:0.087461 |  own half king rolls his foot over the ball and gives it to the right hand side but tavernier
[4203.36 - 4207.84] P:1863.50 E:0.093564 |  high ball lands beyond jack who's running onto it but van dyke was able to get there first
[4207.84 - 4212.56] P:1908.79 E:0.103269 |  and simicast turns it in field fabinho back to simicast just had two more turn it that rolls
[4212.56 - 4221.04] P:1837.18 E:0.080417 |  out of play and a little exchange of words between simicast and fabinho and now lundstrom playing

[4226.40 - 4230.24] P:1809.05 E:0.095043 |  plays it behind nuniez it'd be interesting to see what he does with this he's done well with it he's
[4230.24 - 4235.12] P:1879.40 E:0.100528 |  giving it to carvalho and carvalho takes on king and now nuniez is into the penalty area but
[4235.12 - 4239.68] P:1939.39 E:0.097808 |  lundstrom recovers well puts in the challenge and it bounces behind for a corner liverpool
[4239.68 - 4243.68] P:1858.92 E:0.084942 |  it's acting brilliantly well it's what the midfielders need to do with towns when the
[4243.68 - 4246.72] P:1962.19 E:0.096166 |  full back gets drawn out in the centre out it doesn't go across there's a big gap
[4248.00 - 4253.68] P:1898.26 E:0.087230 |  lundstrom does it really well good tackle on daun and nuniez it bounced back on the nuniez you know
[4253.68 - 4258.08] P:1818.58 E:0.084245 |  that should have been a goal kick i think i think i'm right insane that just saw it on the screen in

[4280.24 - 4284.64] P:1936.69 E:0.096922 |  but fabinho's behind him and that's an overhead pass from fabinho and it just bounces straight
[4284.64 - 4290.16] P:1882.29 E:0.087549 |  through for a goal kick so let's hear for the first time since the second half began at tottenham

[4408.56 - 4414.48] P:1911.85 E:0.101485 |  if he caught it as he wanted that would have been an absolute snorter elliot heading the ball out
[4414.48 - 4418.64] P:1964.24 E:0.097919 |  to gourmet on the right hand side and gourmet who really is getting forward in this second half
[4418.64 - 4426.16] P:2008.98 E:0.098435 |  and his ball across femeno is there and side footed in six yards out a beautiful finish
[4426.16 - 4432.64] P:1914.12 E:0.096066 |  from liverpool's top scorer this season two in the match for him and liverpool who will one
[4432.64 - 4439.12] P:1887.99 E:0.099156 |  mill down here at ibrox now lead by two goals to one and two for femeno it was brilliant from gourmet
[4440.00 - 4446.64] P:1783.61 E:0.097237 |  the pace down the wing the weight of passing to femenio femenio read the line beautifully but
[4446.64 - 4454.24] P:1852.31 E:0.085051 |  water ball in by gourmet he's on side and all he had to do was composure femeno want to finish he's
[4454.24 - 4459.68] P:1822.25 E:0.088676 |  been the star player if you're looking for a player he's been absolutely outstanding from minute one
[4460.32 - 4467.52] P:1898.99 E:0.089094 |  stood up for liverpool lovely on his left foot actually chucked it underneath my Gregor and into
[4467.52 - 4475.44] P:1859.23 E:0.096335 |  the net range has won liverpool two now and Roberto femeno what a start this is what what a start
[4475.44 - 4485.20] P:1904.25 E:0.097552 |  i mean his best season if you remember for liverpool was um back in 2017 2018 when he scored 27 goals
[4485.20 - 4493.44] P:1834.47 E:0.089529 |  in all competitions but since then since then it's been 16 12 9 11 but already now eight this season
[4493.44 - 4498.48] P:1888.29 E:0.094820 |  probably why though john if you look at it he sacrificed himself for the team he does that
[4498.48 - 4502.40] P:1957.85 E:0.088699 |  much work off the ball and the liverpool fans appreciate that because of the work rate he does
[4502.40 - 4509.76] P:1892.33 E:0.092065 |  and he sacrifices his goal input to supply like Salon mani when he was here liverpool now ahead in the
[4509.76 - 4516.16] P:1948.31 E:0.084467 |  match on the course with this score line to make it three champions league group wins in a row and
[4516.16 - 4522.96] P:1919.26 E:0.089411 |  ranges scaring at the feet but if you haven't been listening this match has been much more of a contest
[4522.96 - 4527.60] P:1890.33 E:0.087777 |  than last week although it could hardly be less carvalho chipping the ball across elliot then chips
[4528.40 - 4535.44] P:1861.06 E:0.075141 |  and now for mino is on a hat trick down towards the dead ball line for mino finds carvalho and then
[4535.44 - 4542.24] P:1853.96 E:0.092375 |  for mino back to uh to Henderson Roberto femeno who is also out of contract at the end of this season
[4542.24 - 4549.20] P:1771.21 E:0.084701 |  and liverpool have put the ball out of play canate because ryan jack has gone down and um he i think
[4549.20 - 4553.68] P:1737.49 E:0.096589 |  will need some treatment ryan jack i'm not sure what's happened there but the uh medical people come on
[4554.32 - 4558.88] P:1758.80 E:0.102444 |  but out of contract at the end of the season seemingly uh there's been there's been no word
[4558.88 - 4563.92] P:1940.03 E:0.096553 |  yet of whether there have been talks about the possibility of extending it but remember he is
[4563.92 - 4569.44] P:1872.72 E:0.091900 |  31 years old but if you look at the impact the femeno is going to have on the younger players
[4569.44 - 4575.12] P:1872.17 E:0.085757 |  carvalho elliot all the young players coming through that system he's going to have a huge impact on them
[4575.12 - 4580.00] P:1892.18 E:0.089853 |  i was in my pro license today with one of the liverpool coaches under under 23 coaches and he
[4580.00 - 4586.64] P:1855.77 E:0.084816 |  said femeno trained with him for a few days and he said he was absolutely brilliant attitude first
[4586.64 - 4592.56] P:1845.13 E:0.083394 |  and foremost ability secondly he was just great with all the lads he's the type of character who
[4592.56 - 4597.68] P:1890.69 E:0.091586 |  who talks to younger players you don't always get that in football yet sometimes you get senior
[4597.68 - 4603.52] P:1915.42 E:0.091118 |  players you can be quite arrogant femeno was the total opposite and a true gentleman and he's just
[4603.52 - 4608.96] P:1871.69 E:0.097401 |  short on it i've got years by the way yeah well i mean that touch he made it look simple that finish
[4609.84 - 4616.88] P:1874.02 E:0.095243 |  and uh you know he's a he's a sort of friendly faced individual isn't he with a smile and those
[4616.88 - 4623.52] P:1864.00 E:0.095251 |  lovely teeth of his of course that dazzles you ryan jack that that's going to be it for ryan jack
[4624.32 - 4628.64] P:1945.87 E:0.102675 |  steven davis roddy's coming on steven davis and that's normally this is the stage of the game
[4628.64 - 4633.28] P:1853.69 E:0.104412 |  that where steven davis goes off so they're bringing on legs that have happened there on the
[4633.28 - 4643.52] P:1906.66 E:0.096125 |  east so um liverpool with the ball inside their own half and leading by two goals to one playing
[4643.52 - 4649.12] P:1914.12 E:0.103081 |  at the moment with ten men because ryan jack's evening is over that the veteran steven davis
[4649.12 - 4657.52] P:1928.64 E:0.089093 |  waiting down there started at anfield last week the 37 year old northern island international
[4657.52 - 4664.08] P:1908.78 E:0.081876 |  yes henderson henderson playing the ball across towards van dyke with this scoreline of course it
[4664.08 - 4668.64] P:1814.74 E:0.086635 |  would confirm that rangers would not be able to qualify for the last 16 of the champions league
[4668.64 - 4673.36] P:1859.33 E:0.090017 |  this season but liverpool coming forward with elliot who passes it back still are playing with
[4673.36 - 4679.60] P:1799.59 E:0.082553 |  ten men because the ball's not going out of play rangers so liverpool with van dyke forward towards
[4680.40 - 4684.96] P:1744.24 E:0.091928 |  noon yes we've talking about femeno but really you know we should be talking as well about
[4685.04 - 4688.96] P:1810.59 E:0.093586 |  gomez and the role that he played in that goal femeno chipping the ball over the top
[4688.96 - 4693.20] P:1772.22 E:0.098055 |  that's headed away by davis on the edge of the area henderson now out towards the right
[4693.20 - 4697.76] P:1876.72 E:0.093052 |  hand side gomez with a touch and now a little elliot will take it on quick feet from him
[4697.76 - 4703.04] P:1916.17 E:0.091261 |  almost salalike passes the ball into the box to cavaglio and cavaglios crosses headed away by davis
[4703.04 - 4707.52] P:1846.85 E:0.092731 |  and liverpool have cranked it up in this second half they've got that second goal to go in front
[4708.16 - 4713.12] P:1891.65 E:0.092389 |  but it was almost alexander arnold like the the role that gomez played in that goal
[4713.12 - 4718.40] P:1981.17 E:0.087681 |  he has elliot again does well beats barrisage leford had shot is straight at the gregar who
[4718.40 - 4722.96] P:1858.75 E:0.095749 |  was able to catch the the bouncing ball into his chest so sharp harvey elliot but you're on there
[4722.96 - 4729.20] P:1858.41 E:0.088246 |  about uh about gomez there it was it was a brilliant ball in to swerve it around it was a
[4730.16 - 4738.00] P:1848.07 E:0.082708 |  either needle stuff to get it through to to femeno and you you know it's almost as if we
[4738.64 - 4744.32] P:1924.66 E:0.091898 |  yeah i can imagine the talk at halftime to to gomez to get forward from jürgen klopp and he has
[4744.32 - 4749.04] P:1990.29 E:0.095873 |  carvalho as liverpool come forward again sweep forward they do nunya has now saw the chance to
[4749.04 - 4753.60] P:1884.70 E:0.081381 |  shoot but he shot into the legs of cavania and rangers have been able to clear it away and
[4753.60 - 4758.96] P:1749.14 E:0.099524 |  there's a liverpool man henderson is down inside the liverpool harvon rangers finally
[4758.96 - 4765.52] P:1862.47 E:0.101180 |  it's been played with 10 men there for probably three three minutes or more
[4766.48 - 4771.52] P:1894.85 E:0.093953 |  but uh he's on now rangers number 10 and why they make that change back to alice the bruce ball at
[4771.52 - 4777.84] P:1896.40 E:0.103030 |  totem totem three frankfort one eintracht frankfort now down to 10 men brazilian center back two
[4777.84 - 4783.60] P:1920.52 E:0.101610 |  ta sent off two yellow cards in quick succession the second one he just couldn't handle son kade had
[4783.60 - 4788.40] P:1819.71 E:0.103096 |  already been fouled referee was playing in advance if son had turned him he was trying to get away
[4788.48 - 4794.08] P:1821.60 E:0.099636 |  on go and two to dragged him down red car totem three frankfort one jordan henderson i think is
[4794.08 - 4802.40] P:1732.32 E:0.097949 |  okay jonathan he's certainly back on his feet again as goleman passes the ball forward and gets
[4802.40 - 4806.64] P:1885.00 E:0.080928 |  it back on the halfway line and jordan henderson now in possession yep seems okay yeah he looked
[4806.64 - 4811.68] P:1897.53 E:0.078379 |  like he's got a little clip on the ankles by lungström but he's fine now he's walking now and
[4811.68 - 4816.48] P:1854.59 E:0.096432 |  i can see jordan has wanted to come off in this game calio does well there under pressure from two
[4816.48 - 4821.92] P:1954.01 E:0.098896 |  rangers players pulls them off finds the pass down the left to timie gascicala tracking back
[4821.92 - 4826.40] P:1857.89 E:0.086102 |  puts in the tackle liverpool have upped it in the second there's no question there's no question
[4826.40 - 4831.52] P:1795.73 E:0.079937 |  yet exactly of whatever jorgen klopp said of them half time they've upped the ante they've upped the
[4831.52 - 4838.96] P:1654.32 E:0.087490 |  gears and it's hard for rangers because this is the full of a really top team to one liverpool
[4839.44 - 4846.00] P:1916.22 E:0.091727 |  lead earlier if you haven't heard nappily won four two against iax in this group rangers have
[4846.00 - 4852.96] P:1878.20 E:0.090755 |  still got to go to nappily liverpool's next match is away against iax their next match in the champions
[4852.96 - 4862.08] P:1777.71 E:0.094242 |  league liverpool with it back to uh frank gike uh simicast plays the ball off well thought it
[4862.08 - 4865.52] P:1859.47 E:0.094086 |  had taken a touch off haven't he but it didn't so it's a throwing the rangers just down in front
[4866.16 - 4872.08] P:1900.67 E:0.090462 |  here our position just left of centre actually we're looking more or less across the middle of the
[4873.12 - 4878.08] P:1947.59 E:0.096604 |  the rangers defensive half and they cross the halfway line with barricic and barricic is past
[4878.08 - 4885.28] P:1952.14 E:0.085275 |  looking for kent the gulness defensively does his good work there and liverpool played up towards
[4885.28 - 4892.40] P:1982.19 E:0.097328 |  nunyes again rangers trying to re-establish a foothold really in the match because liverpool
[4892.40 - 4900.88] P:1875.79 E:0.079051 |  now dominating them from the back from substitute king his pass for sakala but simicast wins the
[4900.88 - 4907.52] P:1828.29 E:0.088157 |  header that bounces out of play and it's a throwing to rangers near the halfway line go back for
[4907.52 - 4915.52] P:1875.04 E:0.082154 |  victoria plitzen who are now full one down by in munich and the referee's attention has been drawn
[4915.52 - 4922.00] P:1859.74 E:0.092136 |  by something down here in front of us tiago who's warming up with four of his teammates
[4923.04 - 4929.76] P:1960.86 E:0.099554 |  i think the referee is suggesting that tiago is straight onto the pitch while he's been warming
[4929.76 - 4935.92] P:1935.24 E:0.095934 |  up and the referee is telling tiago that he can't come over the white line and tiago is saying
[4936.48 - 4943.84] P:1919.24 E:0.082103 |  i've not been over the white line and behind the white line i think it's the blue
[4944.40 - 4950.40] P:1813.15 E:0.083826 |  marked lines for these insisting go all that if you're warming up yeah and tiago is actually
[4950.40 - 4955.68] P:1735.32 E:0.089705 |  pointing to the white line but anyway it's a bit petty isn't it in the rest it's slightly petty
[4955.68 - 4960.16] P:1837.69 E:0.093139 |  from the rest you can't come over the blue line get a big chicken are you waiting for that one though
[4960.16 - 4966.08] P:1940.85 E:0.092085 |  won't you righty that would be a big blue tick or a white tick players also don't like the run on
[4966.08 - 4972.08] P:1900.89 E:0.087500 |  the astro turf by the way over the blue lines grass but you have a sides astro their total now

[4979.44 - 4985.28] P:1923.64 E:0.087997 |  playing the other halfway line over on the far side for throwing two rangers is you're just
[4985.28 - 4991.04] P:1912.01 E:0.083181 |  keeping an eye on tiago down there who is um he's jumping over the blue blue line
[4992.32 - 4996.88] P:1907.13 E:0.093175 |  on big right you know the door light run on astro turf if you watch him but run on the grass bit
[4996.88 - 4999.36] P:1861.02 E:0.106383 |  he's getting some of that light he's all of that blue light
[5001.60 - 5008.16] P:1860.28 E:0.083275 |  here's van dyke chesting the ball down inside his his own heart anyway the point's been made
[5008.16 - 5014.48] P:1861.18 E:0.084132 |  and that's the important thing uh allison to the halfway line car valio he's uh he has caught the
[5014.48 - 5020.56] P:1806.80 E:0.086611 |  eye tonight car valio has me i like him yeah really good first yeah first champions league
[5020.56 - 5025.60] P:1850.08 E:0.089254 |  start full of a pull for for him long one forward and the Greg has come into his full back position
[5025.68 - 5029.44] P:1748.04 E:0.086769 |  clears the ball over the head of tiago he's mounding his pees and cues down there
[5030.32 - 5036.88] P:1872.90 E:0.082256 |  and it's out for a throw in for liverpool so uh tiago actually kicks the ball back to
[5036.88 - 5043.60] P:1699.31 E:0.089214 |  simicast is really really risking it now fabinho then back to van dyke inside his own heart

[5150.08 - 5158.16] P:1794.20 E:0.083040 |  croif turn but it's a brilliant brilliant assist and dawin nunyes fair play it takes his time side
[5158.16 - 5165.12] P:1854.90 E:0.082666 |  for lovely finish it's a sort of flick with the with the outside of his heel right into the path

[5307.36 - 5313.44] P:1815.35 E:0.088599 |  tavernier placing behind lunds from it has to go back into the center circle four ranges for once
[5313.44 - 5319.28] P:1817.65 E:0.089566 |  in the second half liverpool having to defend here they've certainly gone up the gear or two in the
[5319.28 - 5325.76] P:1898.44 E:0.089564 |  second half after what was you know quite an evenly contested first 45 minutes or so but ranges
[5325.76 - 5330.40] P:1822.28 E:0.088231 |  with it on the left hand side here's the cross barisic into the area looking for cholak in the
[5330.40 - 5338.88] P:1895.46 E:0.085584 |  middle but it was headed away by van dyke and now lundstrom is able to send a cushioned volley
[5338.88 - 5347.04] P:1812.04 E:0.073266 |  back to king in the center circle ranges go out to the left again barisic the Croatian
[5347.04 - 5353.20] P:1825.19 E:0.086612 |  international back to one of the englishmen in the in the ranges starting lineup then davis
[5354.40 - 5361.28] P:1816.36 E:0.086561 |  and now king into the center circle lundstrom glides onto this king has salah now hovering
[5361.28 - 5366.08] P:1730.41 E:0.086865 |  around in front of him so turns and plays the ball back to go keep back the greger so ranges
[5366.08 - 5370.72] P:1809.24 E:0.091025 |  with it inside their own half leading by three goals to one so both of the premier league clubs
[5370.72 - 5377.28] P:1758.96 E:0.085917 |  with a 3-1 lead tonight 3-1 here in Glasgow to Liverpool and chopped them 3-1 up in london
[5377.28 - 5385.20] P:1868.93 E:0.075986 |  against eintracht frankfurt 20 minutes to play and the atmosphere has definitely taken a hit
[5385.20 - 5390.48] P:1914.15 E:0.092925 |  follow that after that darwin nunia's goal here's tiago through the middle clips the ball forward
[5390.48 - 5397.20] P:1978.70 E:0.090024 |  salah takes it down shoots into the legs of McGregor who is attempting a kind of star jump
[5397.20 - 5402.56] P:1948.36 E:0.100288 |  and the shot from salah hit his legs and bounced away but so far has been able to get the ball past
[5402.56 - 5407.20] P:1959.65 E:0.102960 |  van dyke and so far a pleasure to cross but the covering challenge was there the slide from
[5407.84 - 5412.40] P:1931.79 E:0.100462 |  from canardy i think they're saying the ranges fans that it might have struck an arm of canardy
[5412.40 - 5416.56] P:1789.66 E:0.085164 |  on its way back to allison but the referee's not interested one into the other
[5418.24 - 5422.96] P:1675.31 E:0.090163 |  last season salah you're backing to score that it's good to say about McGregor but then on the
[5422.96 - 5430.40] P:1773.79 E:0.071407 |  counter attack the other end so kala was on a race with van dyke a good block in the end by
[5431.60 - 5437.68] P:1898.02 E:0.099436 |  canardy at Liverpool with tiago lifts a pass out to the left hand side now robertson
[5437.68 - 5442.88] P:1921.08 E:0.094498 |  robertson drives it across elliot brings it down and elliot got it all wrong and actually
[5442.88 - 5447.44] P:1940.44 E:0.093209 |  lifts it to the back post where robertson bolleys it across but it was already out before the
[5447.44 - 5455.44] P:1842.98 E:0.076211 |  robertson body and elliot there he actually had some space there inside the penalty area and
[5456.88 - 5464.72] P:1705.05 E:0.085869 |  just nace hit it never done that an awful lot of time to be honest with you john i couldn't
[5464.72 - 5470.32] P:1810.91 E:0.084740 |  control a ball like harvey elliot could control a ball we all have missed it uh jorgo jokler is
[5470.32 - 5475.76] P:1803.99 E:0.082993 |  going to be the next Liverpool man to to come on there was a link yogan club suggested didn't he
[5475.76 - 5480.16] P:1867.53 E:0.097187 |  before the the match in one of the interviews that he gave that there was a bit of a question mark
[5480.16 - 5485.84] P:1798.67 E:0.092070 |  all about his uh fitness so they weren't going to take a risk with him but he must be okay because
[5485.84 - 5491.28] P:1889.45 E:0.092231 |  he's coming onto the field and uh it's revert all for me no who's leaving the pitch tiago comes
[5491.28 - 5496.88] P:1927.94 E:0.090951 |  across the the two of them have a little laugh together and uh and here he is leaving the field
[5496.88 - 5503.28] P:1900.80 E:0.089943 |  now replaced by jorgo jota two goals and also that lovely assist for nunyes standout performer by
[5503.28 - 5508.80] P:1869.68 E:0.082510 |  some distance for 72 minutes it's been a pleasure to watch him play this game i think he's being
[5508.80 - 5513.36] P:1731.89 E:0.100121 |  brilliant when liverpool have needed him he stepped up to the mark like you say john two goals and
[5514.00 - 5520.16] P:1868.06 E:0.079928 |  outstanding assist and if it is the case but there's not yet been any talks about a new
[5520.16 - 5527.68] P:1811.50 E:0.085922 |  contract i think if i were revert all for me knows representatives i think i'd be making noises wouldn't
[5527.68 - 5533.68] P:1783.65 E:0.081986 |  you liverpool behind the scenes regarding like contract negotiations they know exactly what they're
[5533.68 - 5539.92] P:1719.81 E:0.089347 |  doing julie ward he's a new sporting director doing a brilliant job shadowing mike ledwoods over the
[5539.92 - 5545.84] P:1787.90 E:0.076596 |  last couple of seasons i'm sure they'll have that all all on lockdown yes and i'm sure his representatives
[5545.84 - 5551.76] P:1820.24 E:0.088514 |  don't need me to remind them what to do i suspect they're quite sharp there's the ball bounces out
[5551.76 - 5557.44] P:1891.74 E:0.082049 |  was playing on the halfway line they tend to be don't they those those types they don't miss many
[5557.44 - 5563.92] P:1893.18 E:0.087734 |  tricks do you know exactly what they're doing yes they do he's learning off michael as well so he's in
[5563.92 - 5570.80] P:1833.63 E:0.082785 |  good hands uh range is going to make another change and it's uh scott right who's going to come onto
[5570.80 - 5576.24] P:1949.38 E:0.103224 |  the field oh allison almost gets himself into bother but is able to turn and play the ball away
[5576.24 - 5581.12] P:1861.69 E:0.078614 |  just does well actually in the in the end against cholak and it was helpful but it comes back again
[5581.12 - 5587.60] P:1847.46 E:0.076184 |  and allison has given bandag a big shout there and bandag allows the ball to bounce through to
[5588.64 - 5593.60] P:1880.42 E:0.084983 |  little croft turn outside of the foot pass it has gone wrong from in the past before but
[5593.60 - 5598.40] P:1830.25 E:0.085178 |  it has tonight range is one liverpool three bristol city are back in front robert arkinson scored his
[5598.40 - 5604.24] P:1841.37 E:0.088286 |  second goal of the game so bristol city two one over that's in the 90th minute and here comes jota
[5604.24 - 5609.76] P:1953.84 E:0.099641 |  for liverpool to the edge of the area plays it square carvalho's onto this shoots into the legs of
[5609.84 - 5615.04] P:1926.45 E:0.096776 |  tavernier and then on the uh as he tried to keep possession i think he was caught referee allows
[5615.04 - 5620.48] P:1960.71 E:0.095873 |  play to continue elliot goes for goal and it dips narrowly over the top of the crossbar from what
[5620.48 - 5625.60] P:1965.77 E:0.088111 |  will that be 20 yards plus on the right hand side let's bring in ready for sight again so you know
[5625.60 - 5630.24] P:1857.74 E:0.090090 |  the metondo is also going to come on so we're going to see a double substitution here with range
[5630.24 - 5634.48] P:1792.77 E:0.097665 |  is presumably trying to take the game to liverpool for the last 15 minutes and you would imagine it
[5634.48 - 5639.92] P:1798.71 E:0.105946 |  would be either our field or so cala who would make way when there's a fact more relice is also
[5639.92 - 5645.60] P:1793.48 E:0.089084 |  going to come on so that looks like the end of the night for one striker who hasn't had a touch on
[5645.60 - 5652.08] P:1859.46 E:0.086135 |  goal game thank you roddy range is one liverpool three ranges on the back foot again though before
[5652.08 - 5660.16] P:1922.15 E:0.089803 |  they can make those changes uh clearance from the king bounces back into the area salah has threaded
[5660.16 - 5668.72] P:1970.10 E:0.094029 |  it in super finished from salah and the liverpool fans behind them in that corner all rise to their
[5668.72 - 5674.16] P:1945.79 E:0.092809 |  feet to acclaim mo salah who's threaded it in i don't know how he found the space there and
[5674.16 - 5679.76] P:1929.52 E:0.086700 |  liverpool now lead by four goals to one here at ibrox was it an incredible touch brought it out the
[5679.76 - 5686.64] P:1925.55 E:0.069990 |  sky took it on a six pence water touch there was spin on the ball and everything and then finished
[5686.72 - 5690.80] P:1864.45 E:0.089450 |  past mcgregor nonchalant just tore pokes at home mcgregor probably didn't think he was going to
[5690.80 - 5698.48] P:1848.96 E:0.078171 |  do that but it's literally a tore poke into the far corner jogan clops reaction was very
[5698.48 - 5702.64] P:1799.70 E:0.103662 |  graphic by the way if you get the chance to see it he seemed an extremely contented man at that stage
[5705.44 - 5711.68] P:1845.63 E:0.096628 |  and here come the rangers changes and we're just seeing a replay of jogan clops
[5712.24 - 5720.64] P:1985.90 E:0.089605 |  face bump punch of the face and rangers making these changes now so uh sacala makes way
[5722.64 - 5728.16] P:1865.24 E:0.098945 |  shalak replaced by morellas scott right is on as well for ryan kent
[5733.36 - 5738.24] P:1921.80 E:0.087810 |  so matondo on the right hand side did well when he came on it at anfield last week but
[5738.88 - 5743.92] P:1904.28 E:0.088156 |  that the game's gone level pool leading by four goals to one uh victoria plitzen who were four
[5743.92 - 5751.76] P:1882.29 E:0.081601 |  nailed down mind you have scored a second goal so plitzen two by in munich four and uh
[5755.68 - 5762.56] P:1899.46 E:0.088697 |  free kicked rangers on the halfway line that lunstrand is looking to take so matondo on on the right
[5762.64 - 5770.16] P:1841.66 E:0.079762 |  and right on the left if i can put it in those terms here is tavernier on the in the full back
[5770.16 - 5774.96] P:1901.44 E:0.092043 |  position the level full back position and in slights king with the challenge uh little rangers
[5774.96 - 5780.72] P:1860.21 E:0.077590 |  were fortunate there to get the ball back davis plays it towards the edge of the penalty area
[5781.28 - 5787.52] P:1902.04 E:0.089732 |  it's worked square back to davis davis now to tavernier but a stretch from andy robertson who wins
[5788.48 - 5794.16] P:1791.98 E:0.089288 |  and uh robertson back in action for the first time since naples when liverpool started with
[5794.16 - 5800.64] P:1895.42 E:0.072600 |  that full one defeat but liverpool themselves winning four one here so for rangers on their
[5800.64 - 5807.92] P:1918.70 E:0.073915 |  return to the champions league now it doesn't look good does it four nil away to iax three nil at
[5807.92 - 5815.12] P:1880.85 E:0.082553 |  home to nappoli two nil at anfield and four one down here to liverpool in the return match it
[5815.20 - 5820.32] P:1962.58 E:0.080855 |  really has been a step up that they've not been able to deal with it's a step up in in pure
[5820.32 - 5826.96] P:1967.32 E:0.078709 |  class and you've seen that in the in the second half jam with just the performance of femenio
[5827.60 - 5833.92] P:1832.54 E:0.081187 |  with salo coming on and scoring a goal darwin nunes wait they've raised the bar in the second half
[5833.92 - 5838.40] P:1740.95 E:0.080932 |  liverpool and and rangers haven't been able to stay with them it's understandable by the way you're
[5838.40 - 5842.88] P:1845.29 E:0.082623 |  talking about different budgets and different players altogether so liverpool are on a different
[5842.88 - 5847.60] P:1700.67 E:0.087656 |  a different wavelength compared to rangers financially yeah we were making that point
[5847.60 - 5856.08] P:1795.48 E:0.087704 |  last week as well liverpool are going to bring james milner on next to replace canate so jill
[5856.08 - 5859.68] P:1813.50 E:0.103109 |  gormers i guess will move across into central defense while they do that let's get another

[5912.32 - 5917.68] P:1888.52 E:0.084072 |  incidentally salat playing the ball forward from the halfway line but elliot can't reach that and
[5917.68 - 5922.40] P:1756.48 E:0.095815 |  it's out of play for a pro deranger i love it when you give me them stats jump i absolutely love it
[5922.40 - 5926.48] P:1839.14 E:0.090862 |  well it must be a big crisis mustn't it for liverpool when you've lost just one of your
[5927.20 - 5933.36] P:1901.03 E:0.101886 |  last 42 home matches here's that jota playing it through salar on the edge of the area
[5933.36 - 5940.24] P:1987.52 E:0.099821 |  or this could be ominous it is it's another one for salar it's a fifth for liverpool and this now
[5940.24 - 5946.16] P:1962.17 E:0.096743 |  really has a re-evalve embarrassment about it for rangers who led on the night but now find themselves
[5946.16 - 5953.28] P:1907.22 E:0.084695 |  five one down to liverpool the finish from salar he's been on the pitch pitch what seven minutes
[5953.52 - 5959.36] P:1888.81 E:0.074807 |  he could have had a hat trick already but he's finishing his finish there he just stopped the
[5959.36 - 5965.36] P:1855.40 E:0.091745 |  ball he put his abs brakes on and just bent it past migrega not much of a salar brace it's probably
[5965.36 - 5975.04] P:1767.78 E:0.074896 |  like a thing to say i'm still here i'm still there there was an extraordinary finish and he slows
[5975.04 - 5980.40] P:1862.21 E:0.083281 |  himself down puts in rolls his foot over the ball and migreger has no chance
[5980.64 - 5991.60] P:1799.02 E:0.081724 |  two goals in four minutes for salar 76th and the 80th minutes of the match
[5991.60 - 5998.24] P:1727.00 E:0.093138 |  and rangers won liverpool five and it's the liverpool fans now you can hear the 2600 a sore of them

[6007.28 - 6011.68] P:1885.90 E:0.091031 |  promise for rangers in the first half particularly that r-field goal the first goal that they've
[6011.68 - 6017.36] P:1873.35 E:0.080269 |  scored in the champions league for 12 years now this score line i mean this is quite ugly isn't it
[6017.36 - 6022.40] P:1784.67 E:0.080116 |  for them you wouldn't have expected it when they came out to the second half you wouldn't expect

[6174.48 - 6180.64] P:1881.94 E:0.083021 |  pounds or euros i think it is that you know it's so important for rangers but on the pitch
[6180.64 - 6184.96] P:1890.06 E:0.098862 |  i mean it's turned into a nightmare and actually when you think about it there's tiago fouls right
[6184.96 - 6189.20] P:1859.18 E:0.092528 |  on the halfway line and that's a free kick and it's not going to be a yellow card if he just gives
[6189.20 - 6196.48] P:1820.95 E:0.089868 |  the free kick it has turned into a nightmare for rangers it has you're dealing with a top player
[6196.96 - 6202.00] P:1821.71 E:0.101506 |  in salar just to come off the bench and make that difference with femenio top top players

[6224.48 - 6230.88] P:1801.74 E:0.085818 |  so that is bristol city's first win in six matches been a poor run just one point in that time
[6231.60 - 6238.56] P:1667.48 E:0.091382 |  but they've beaten preston tonight with two goals from robert adkinson and also basa lona

[6480.72 - 6485.44] P:1782.81 E:0.090515 |  the ali at because in the game when it was getting a bit sticky in the first half he always wanted
[6485.44 - 6489.04] P:1803.08 E:0.089790 |  the ball and he always tried to get on the ball and make something happen and he's deserved that
[6489.04 - 6495.52] P:1823.61 E:0.072361 |  goal and you could see all the players were absolutely delighted for him young kid first
[6495.52 - 6501.04] P:1879.43 E:0.084179 |  goal in the champions they were a brilliant moment for him well it is a record breaker this for Rangers
[6501.04 - 6507.84] P:1920.51 E:0.083536 |  in the way that they wouldn't have wanted their the heaviest home defeat previously in European
[6507.84 - 6517.20] P:1946.19 E:0.081895 |  competitions was a 4-0 against Juventus in the champions league group stage back in 1995
[6519.12 - 6525.92] P:1981.26 E:0.088539 |  and I'm just looking to see if it is that the heaviest defeat in all and it is it is the
[6525.92 - 6530.64] P:1975.09 E:0.094800 |  heaviest defeat in European competitions if it stays like this let's bring in Ruddy again well
[6530.64 - 6538.88] P:1883.46 E:0.090332 |  they had a 6-1 6-3 defeat by over two lines against Eintracht in 1960 that's what I've got as the
[6539.68 - 6547.68] P:1953.09 E:0.081626 |  heaviest previous the and a 5-0 as well against Cologne but this this beats them all Rangers won
[6547.68 - 6552.72] P:1955.62 E:0.096287 |  Liverpool seven back to Tottenham Alistair Bruce fall well this one not over just yet 10 man
[6552.72 - 6557.44] P:1970.40 E:0.098685 |  Frankfurt have scored from a corner Mario Goertzer killed it in Evan and Dicker headed in from close
[6557.44 - 6562.16] P:1838.75 E:0.099472 |  range to Tottenham just got to be professional here and see this one out we're in the 90th minute
[6562.16 - 6568.88] P:1926.29 E:0.083952 |  it's Tottenham three Frankfurt two Rangers have got a free kick in the middle of the Liverpool
[6568.88 - 6574.72] P:1914.59 E:0.081336 |  half the fourth official is just coming forward with the board one minute about a time one minute
[6575.44 - 6579.92] P:1847.16 E:0.096827 |  how many substitutes those are likes of mercy well it is isn't it I mean I didn't think you
[6579.92 - 6586.16] P:1857.00 E:0.080109 |  away if I did that but clearly they do I mean that's ridiculous but I don't think anyone
[6586.88 - 6593.36] P:1804.57 E:0.084599 |  in a blue shirt will will mind and there's a red card check now going on three kickers taken though
[6593.36 - 6600.24] P:1784.44 E:0.075133 |  so that's not going to transpire the check is over and here's Tavernier on the right hand side
[6600.24 - 6604.96] P:1815.98 E:0.091983 |  Tavernier is able to get over the cross to the back post as there was a sandwich there the back
[6604.96 - 6610.32] P:1801.45 E:0.086632 |  post on Matondo but he didn't go down and Liverpool were able to clear it away so one minute of added
[6610.32 - 6617.36] P:1808.17 E:0.076502 |  time and what a nightmare this has been for Rangers in the second half and the bulls just overrun by
[6617.36 - 6624.32] P:1902.17 E:0.083470 |  Matondo although it's taken a flick off a Liverpool leg and it's through and it is a corner for Rangers
[6624.32 - 6626.80] P:1875.28 E:0.091891 |  I'll make it we've got 10 seconds left of time to play
[6627.76 - 6634.32] P:1793.02 E:0.076081 |  and Rangers I think this corner will be the last action of the match
[6635.84 - 6641.20] P:1906.78 E:0.091321 |  it's not going to change anything this on the scoreboard above where the corner is being taken
[6641.92 - 6648.24] P:1898.43 E:0.085408 |  one seven is on the big screen here's the corner into the middle it comes out for the shot that
[6648.24 - 6654.16] P:2024.93 E:0.092581 |  is blocked on the edge of the area still Rangers have it Tavernier is is fouled but that's the
[6654.16 - 6661.44] P:2005.91 E:0.096004 |  final whistle and it's a chorus of booze inside Ibrox from the home supporters what a scoreline
[6661.44 - 6670.08] P:1994.13 E:0.086018 |  we've got here tonight Rangers won Liverpool seven and it was one one at half time and this is Rangers
[6670.08 - 6678.40] P:1915.50 E:0.080312 |  record defeat in any European competition it means you'll have gathered they cannot now qualify
[6678.40 - 6683.12] P:1910.13 E:0.085123 |  for the latter stages of the Champions League the knockout stages after Christmas but
[6683.84 - 6688.80] P:1916.07 E:0.091874 |  what a nightmare second half for Rangers and Liverpool themselves now just need one more
[6688.80 - 6693.68] P:1942.60 E:0.081546 |  point against Ajax to take their place in the last 16 more on this to come the first to Tottenham
[6693.68 - 6697.44] P:1952.75 E:0.105666 |  Alistair Bruce Ball yeah not quite sure what's been going on this evening John Harry Kane just
[6697.44 - 6701.36] P:1829.44 E:0.109266 |  missed his second penalty this season he's away now though clear on the left hand side crosses the
[6701.36 - 6707.76] P:1905.23 E:0.105010 |  ball in towards Brian Hill the substitute who threw himself at it couldn't convert he was the one
[6707.76 - 6711.92] P:1938.25 E:0.095254 |  the young Spaniard who was tripped in added time some was off the pitch I don't think came
[6711.92 - 6716.48] P:1874.92 E:0.098855 |  would have let him take the penalty anyway for the hat trick and Kane very unusually went for power
[6716.48 - 6720.88] P:1944.39 E:0.100106 |  and smashed it over the bar Tottenham are leading on track Frankfurt by three goals to two we've
[6720.88 - 6726.88] P:1896.45 E:0.089944 |  got about two minutes of added time remaining and as it stands with the win Tottenham will go top of
[6726.88 - 6731.92] P:1921.32 E:0.098303 |  group D but a very rare sight there Kane's smashing a penalty over the bar Tottenham leave Frankfurt
[6731.92 - 6737.76] P:1901.58 E:0.091698 |  3-2 so the players are still on the pitch here at Ibrox there is an eerie atmosphere inside the
[6737.76 - 6742.64] P:1940.25 E:0.087139 |  ground compared to what it was like just before the match you know when this place was absolutely
[6742.64 - 6747.92] P:1937.49 E:0.086607 |  bouncing one one at halftime now it's just the Liverpool fans in one corner that you can hear
[6747.92 - 6752.96] P:1963.97 E:0.091411 |  so one one at halftime after Rangers took the lead through our field but Firmino made it one one
[6752.96 - 6760.40] P:1921.08 E:0.086046 |  and then those six goals in the second half one for Firmino one for Darwin Nunez that five-minute
[6760.40 - 6765.68] P:1946.85 E:0.083060 |  hat trick from substitute Salah and then Harvey Elliott at the end getting his first Champions League
[6765.68 - 6774.48] P:1950.48 E:0.089724 |  goal after the VAR check so Rangers won Liverpool 7 and Kelly Cates is here with us inside Ibrox
[6775.76 - 6780.64] P:1900.93 E:0.102292 |  Jonathan it was a completely different Liverpool that we saw in the second half of that game it's
[6780.64 - 6785.92] P:1839.67 E:0.094946 |  spelt at times this season that they had another gear to go to we just haven't seen them kick on
[6786.48 - 6791.20] P:1847.74 E:0.080629 |  this game they managed to do it what was the difference you think you just witnessed how good
[6791.20 - 6797.44] P:1881.75 E:0.083331 |  they were in that second half and what that Liverpool team can do but it was it was the three in
[6797.44 - 6802.16] P:1970.67 E:0.099855 |  Firmino Cavalio and Harvey Elliott who really started getting on the ball and really started
[6802.16 - 6807.28] P:1818.78 E:0.077914 |  dominating it and Rangers struggled to pick them players up at times they didn't the first half but
[6807.28 - 6813.12] P:1906.54 E:0.080349 |  second half especially Firmino produced a lovely goal his flick through what we said in commentary
[6813.12 - 6817.92] P:1811.69 E:0.081349 |  was absolutely world class and then they bring more Salah on it could have had actually four
[6817.92 - 6823.84] P:1895.50 E:0.072842 |  goals I mean Liverpool had nine shots on target and scored seven so it was a totally different
[6823.84 - 6829.12] P:1880.99 E:0.085894 |  ball game from first half to second half. Liverpool clinical in in the second half of that game with
[6829.12 - 6836.88] P:1928.75 E:0.086052 |  that 7-1 victory at Ibrox for Rangers Roddy Forsythe it's a heavy defeat seems a long time ago that
[6836.88 - 6841.92] P:1883.12 E:0.090355 |  we were saying right Rangers have got their first goal of this this group stage they looked on course
[6841.92 - 6847.36] P:1912.00 E:0.088355 |  for all three points at that stage Liverpool pulled it back and they went in level at half time
[6847.36 - 6852.24] P:1938.54 E:0.086470 |  it's not just this defeat which ends their chances of qualifying for the knockout stage of the
