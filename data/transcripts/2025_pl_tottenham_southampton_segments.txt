[0.00 - 5.60] P:1653.11 E:0.114329 |  Kevin, thank you very much, Indy. Good afternoon. Welcome along to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
[5.60 - 10.40] P:1498.66 E:0.123096 |  It has been a season arribilis for both of these football clubs.
[10.40 - 16.72] P:1442.43 E:0.136054 |  We could have our first relegation of the campaign confirmed, with Southampton staring into the abyss,
[16.72 - 22.80] P:1604.11 E:0.122518 |  whilst Tottenham Hotspur are on course to finish outside of the top ten for the first time in 17 years.
[22.80 - 30.56] P:1812.69 E:0.125073 |  As Kelly Slater alongside Stephen Kelly for you on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and Stephen, these two make quite the pair.
[30.56 - 36.96] P:1431.21 E:0.116316 |  Yeah, they do. They really do. Tottenham's only hope is that Europa League coming up during the week, Southampton.
[36.96 - 44.80] P:1398.92 E:0.107656 |  It's a matter of when, not if, and if it's today, they go down as the earliest team to relegate in Premier League history,
[44.80 - 50.64] P:1569.05 E:0.109684 |  which no one will want. It's got the smacking of it. A pre-season friendly here to some extent.
[50.64 - 54.88] P:1411.64 E:0.111455 |  Sun is shining. I don't think either fans are enamoured by what they're going to see,
[54.88 - 57.68] P:1475.48 E:0.113551 |  but fingers crossed we get a game that's going to be exciting.
[57.68 - 62.00] P:1777.46 E:0.115155 |  Yes, fingers crossed it doesn't have pre-season friendly vibes, as Stephen alluded to.
[62.00 - 66.32] P:1945.42 E:0.112340 |  We've got one team trying to avoid the worst season in club history,
[66.32 - 69.68] P:1997.19 E:0.118183 |  the other trying to avoid the worst season in Premier League history.
[69.68 - 76.00] P:1842.00 E:0.111317 |  Those maths very straightforward for Southampton lose, and they will be relegated, doing so,
[76.00 - 81.36] P:1801.72 E:0.109341 |  in record breakingly quick fashion. The Saints, they lack in a number of areas, Stephen,
[81.36 - 86.48] P:1916.31 E:0.108596 |  but surely with these horrific wooden spoons being waved in their direction,
[86.48 - 89.60] P:1711.73 E:0.102825 |  they don't lack in the motivation department.
[89.60 - 95.52] P:1780.24 E:0.108803 |  You would think so. It's so interesting because the whole, the cliche, you're playing for pride,
[95.52 - 98.88] P:1589.03 E:0.121689 |  you're playing for pride. Listen, I've been there, I've been in that situation before,
[98.88 - 103.36] P:1729.26 E:0.111450 |  and they have to show something. You have to show something to your manager, to your fans,
[103.44 - 108.00] P:1753.07 E:0.113054 |  that you weren't the place in this team going forward, or if you're in a position where you're
[108.00 - 111.44] P:1614.18 E:0.120071 |  going to go play and other teams can look for you, whatever is your motivation,
[111.44 - 115.04] P:1695.03 E:0.110105 |  you have to put on the pitch today, and you have to try and get something, and let's face it,
[115.04 - 119.52] P:1698.93 E:0.105628 |  it's a time to cook, go and get a result against Spurs at home, because many teams have.
[119.52 - 124.96] P:1876.90 E:0.120876 |  Well, a wall of noise has greeted the two teams. The sun is shining in north London.
[124.96 - 132.40] P:1708.50 E:0.111307 |  It is a beautiful spring afternoon as the two great underwhelmers in this season's Premier League
[132.40 - 137.84] P:1739.34 E:0.111486 |  meet with just eight matches remaining. Southampton fighting to avoid the drop here and now. Spurs
[137.84 - 143.92] P:1834.41 E:0.107332 |  fighting to avoid the tag of Worst Tottenham team for a generation. Son Kyung-min led the Tottenham
[143.92 - 150.16] P:1775.68 E:0.111820 |  side out, all of them wearing sky blue training jackets over the top of their home kit, matching
[150.16 - 156.88] P:1868.76 E:0.110021 |  the sky that hangs over the top of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the Golden Cockerel, which presides
[156.88 - 164.40] P:1666.33 E:0.097393 |  above all of it, resplendent in the sunshine, the sun kissing off of its neck. As both teams have
[164.40 - 170.96] P:1686.00 E:0.109342 |  made three changes, Spurs are entering a season and potentially tenured defending, defining
[170.96 - 176.00] P:1795.53 E:0.114975 |  Fortnite, and Ange-Poster Cogglue has one eye on Thursday's huge Europa League quarterfinal with
[176.00 - 182.00] P:1721.99 E:0.107955 |  his team selection. Three changes, Pedro Porro, Ben Davis and Brennan Johnson return for destiny,
[182.00 - 186.48] P:1554.93 E:0.113550 |  who doggy Mickey van der Ven and Wilson Odube, all drop into the bench where they find Brazilian
[186.48 - 191.28] P:1665.81 E:0.106596 |  forward, Rashalison, the lesser spotted Rashalison. Back from another injury, he's involved in a
[191.28 - 194.88] P:1733.94 E:0.111797 |  Premier League squad for the first time in two months. Southampton also make three changes,
[194.88 - 199.84] P:1643.93 E:0.106113 |  Flins Downs is suspended after picking up his tenth yellow card of the season. Paul Onowachu
[199.84 - 205.28] P:1716.34 E:0.115504 |  fit enough only for the bench after injuring his ankle. Jack Stevens also drops out as the Saints
[205.28 - 211.20] P:1743.99 E:0.115314 |  look to be switching to a 4-3-3 formation. Joe Arebo, Cameron Archer and Tyler Dibbling,
[211.20 - 216.32] P:1721.37 E:0.113537 |  whose Spurs are reportedly interested in targeting this summer all-star, but Steven
[216.32 - 221.20] P:1752.79 E:0.110687 |  clearly Ange-Poster Cogglue, who will come on to in a moment, has got one eye on Thursday night.
[221.20 - 226.80] P:1632.56 E:0.113324 |  Oh, you would think he's so focused on this, on the back of his defeat against Chelsea midweek,
[226.80 - 230.48] P:1618.80 E:0.119324 |  that they're going to feel like they can win here. If they can't beat Southampton at home,
[230.48 - 236.08] P:1699.47 E:0.114241 |  there's something seriously wrong with Spurs. And to go in confidently into the next game,
[236.08 - 240.00] P:1533.41 E:0.119964 |  you feel getting a win at home, getting the fans on the cheer about, and then getting the support
[240.00 - 244.32] P:1656.37 E:0.114881 |  you need going into Europa League. But the pressure is on this side, and this is not the
[244.32 - 249.52] P:1704.45 E:0.114511 |  game that defines the season. It's going to be Thursday. Spurs in their home kit of white and
[249.52 - 256.08] P:1740.67 E:0.109912 |  navy blue, Southampton in a pink away strip, pink shirts, pink shorts and white socks.
[256.08 - 261.28] P:1836.82 E:0.116229 |  Ange-Poster Cogglue stood patrolling the edge of his technical area far down beneath the set
[261.28 - 266.88] P:1683.04 E:0.117714 |  pitch level, with his hands in his pockets wearing a long-sleeved navy blue polo neck
[266.88 - 273.28] P:1788.44 E:0.113130 |  and black trousers. He's had a lot to say over the last few days about VAR, about society,
[273.28 - 279.20] P:1852.37 E:0.119422 |  and about the relationship with supporters as well. And a good comfortable win here this afternoon
[279.20 - 284.64] P:1689.57 E:0.117788 |  would help to bridge that gap ahead of an important fortnight. Yeah, I really would. You feel that
[284.64 - 290.80] P:1619.75 E:0.118043 |  they fall apart so much from when he came in first, and there was just this kind of sense of
[290.80 - 295.84] P:1575.19 E:0.123226 |  energy, enthusiasm, and the Tottenham playing this sensationally attacking minded football,
[295.84 - 300.48] P:1495.06 E:0.123309 |  that the Tottenham fans are all getting behind, and now it feels like they've fallen so far away
[300.48 - 305.28] P:1578.29 E:0.118230 |  from that. And the manager, listen, I agree with some of his points with, you know, phones and all
[305.28 - 310.08] P:1620.20 E:0.112532 |  this, I think just being present in the moment and all that sort of stuff. But he's losing the
[310.08 - 313.76] P:1491.70 E:0.116597 |  track of what's going on, and I think the only thing that can change is results on the pitch.
[313.76 - 319.84] P:1524.01 E:0.114059 |  That's the only thing that can get him back on track with the fans. Still a great noise here at the
[319.84 - 325.76] P:1758.57 E:0.104677 |  Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Southampton won the toss. They've turned Tottenham around, and so
[325.76 - 330.80] P:1683.32 E:0.109970 |  Tottenham will take the kickoff. James Madison is stood over the ball, and Spurs will attack the
[330.80 - 338.64] P:1839.42 E:0.108099 |  wall away to our right hand side. It looks to be another complete full house here in North London.
[338.64 - 343.44] P:1716.37 E:0.113367 |  Aaron Ramsdale has made his way in front of the wall, and the former Arsenal goalkeeper
[344.08 - 349.12] P:1840.93 E:0.115157 |  is greeted in kind, as you would expect. This is Tottenham Hotspur's dedicated no room for
[349.12 - 355.36] P:1811.08 E:0.106468 |  racism fixture, and so both teams take the knee, and we are underway. It is Premier League Sunday
[355.36 - 361.36] P:1723.04 E:0.109746 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live here on Sports Extra. Spurs start the day 16th, one place lower than their
[361.36 - 366.24] P:1847.26 E:0.109601 |  worst ever Premier League finish. The only way is surely up for them. The only way is down, though,
[366.24 - 371.84] P:1614.96 E:0.099534 |  for Southampton. The trapdoor is wide open and ready for the Saints to throw themselves through it,
[371.84 - 378.16] P:1781.74 E:0.101865 |  relegated today if they lose. Spurs have the ball down the left. Jed Spence right footed outside
[378.16 - 383.36] P:1746.22 E:0.109992 |  of his boot finds James Madison, who's in the corner flag area on the far side of the ground,
[383.36 - 387.92] P:1701.27 E:0.093509 |  fixed across it twice. The former Spurs player Kyle Walker Peters stays with him,
[387.92 - 394.08] P:1594.76 E:0.096620 |  and it's an early Spurs throwing. Yeah, you feel the Spence on the ball for me is being
[394.08 - 398.08] P:1412.54 E:0.111058 |  one of Spurs' best players, and he would have been a player that was nowhere near to starting on,
[398.08 - 402.64] P:1554.47 E:0.093827 |  but the start of the side was fought his way back into it, and you feel a lot of these players
[402.64 - 406.40] P:1642.23 E:0.101409 |  have to really kind of redeem themselves, and you know, they've got eight games to do left in the
[406.40 - 411.28] P:1590.66 E:0.087531 |  Premier League, and they've got a few massive fixtures in Europa League, and this is this game
[411.28 - 415.28] P:1456.31 E:0.097448 |  you're playing for a place in that game on Thursday. That game on Thursday evening will have
[415.28 - 422.32] P:1685.31 E:0.107280 |  updates on BBC Radio 5 Live against Iron Trap Frankfurt. Spurs kicking from left to right in
[422.32 - 427.12] P:1658.25 E:0.115696 |  their white and navy blue homestrip as Brennan Johnson looks to sneak in, but the ball might
[427.12 - 432.32] P:1755.42 E:0.112192 |  fall to Salanki instead. Inside the penalty area, Downey goes under the challenge of Bednarek.
[432.32 - 438.32] P:1747.13 E:0.090741 |  The referee waves it away, and Southampton will try to hammer it clear down the left
[438.40 - 442.48] P:1785.29 E:0.100304 |  touchline in the direction of Aribo. Run you through the teams here in a moment as soon as the
[442.48 - 447.28] P:1716.59 E:0.107872 |  ball goes there, as Madison picks it up in the heart of the Spurs midfield, squares it in the
[447.28 - 452.80] P:1632.84 E:0.101275 |  direction of Spence, and Madison gets it back again. Vicario is in goal for them, a back four of
[452.80 - 458.64] P:1614.05 E:0.099067 |  Porro, Romero, Davis, and Spence. The last of those is on the ball right now, edge of the penalty
[458.64 - 463.68] P:1805.00 E:0.105660 |  area, left hand touchline, overlap for Madison, who's got far too much space, drills his cross
[463.68 - 468.72] P:1673.61 E:0.091927 |  off the backside of Walker Peters, comes back to Spence once more, we've played nearly two minutes,
[468.72 - 474.64] P:1685.35 E:0.086227 |  it's goalless as Madison's right footed ball is headed away by Bednarek out as far as Benton
[474.64 - 479.04] P:1740.18 E:0.102146 |  Kerr. Benton Kerr is in the middle of a three-man midfield, Bergwald to his right, Madison to his
[479.04 - 484.08] P:1418.37 E:0.094712 |  left, up top, Brennan Johnson on the right, Sun Hyeong-min on the left, and Dominic Salanki
[484.08 - 490.64] P:1438.53 E:0.101151 |  through the middle. Here is the Spurs skipper, Sun Hyeong-min. Still goalless here in a resplendent
[490.64 - 496.80] P:1492.54 E:0.103407 |  Tottenham-Hurtsworth stadium, not a seat to be viewed anywhere inside this ground, a crowd of
[496.80 - 502.08] P:1535.78 E:0.105276 |  around 60,000 expected, and they tend to fair pretty well against Southampton, beating them
[502.08 - 507.36] P:1566.60 E:0.109850 |  5-0 on the south coast when the two sides met in December. Benton Kerr is the target of the
[507.36 - 512.88] P:1601.71 E:0.092449 |  next ball down the left, just about keeps it in before the byline, and it's back with Sun Hyeong-min,
[512.88 - 517.36] P:1567.08 E:0.114143 |  little ball for Bergwald inside the penalty area, cuts it back in the direction of Salanki, turns,
[517.44 - 521.52] P:1644.13 E:0.086048 |  hits it, blocked by Bednarek, and then Hammond Clear by Mattias Fernandez.
[522.40 - 527.68] P:1726.13 E:0.111511 |  Southampton have just started like a team that completely describes how they've played Saturday
[527.68 - 532.24] P:1636.27 E:0.089040 |  season, or have been this far in the Premier League. They look like a team waiting to be beaten,
[532.24 - 538.88] P:1608.29 E:0.088411 |  and that's where three minutes in, and every clearance is just a hoof away, they're trying to
[538.88 - 544.32] P:1649.01 E:0.104585 |  get rid of their lines, and they're just sitting back so deep. The problem is for Tottenham,
[544.32 - 550.16] P:1495.96 E:0.109383 |  it's Tottenham on the counter, can get done, so even though you feel Southampton are really under
[550.16 - 556.24] P:1596.77 E:0.086901 |  the coach so far, Tottenham leave themselves exposed, and Southampton will know that. Interesting
[556.24 - 562.40] P:1682.24 E:0.097162 |  four-star, first few moments. The boos for Aaron Ramsdell, the Southampton keeper in front of him,
[562.40 - 567.44] P:1813.21 E:0.098897 |  they're playing a 4-2-3-1 formation from right to left at the back. Kyle Walker-Peters, who
[567.44 - 573.84] P:1727.17 E:0.096452 |  isn't getting such a rude reception here in north London as Walker-Peters returns to the club that
[573.84 - 579.36] P:1833.30 E:0.099732 |  he came through at as a child, played 24 times for the first team as Ramsdell's ball runs all the
[579.36 - 584.72] P:1741.17 E:0.095981 |  way through to Vicario at the other end. Harwood Bellis and Bednarak in the middle of the defence
[584.72 - 589.44] P:1680.45 E:0.098349 |  with Manning at left-fallback in midfield, Ogachukwu and Arebo with Dibbling on the right,
[589.44 - 595.52] P:1726.19 E:0.081780 |  Fernandez and Sulamana getting forwards in support of Cameron Archer. Poros on the ball for Spurs,
[595.52 - 600.96] P:1879.95 E:0.080344 |  bright pink boots, matching the kits of Southampton, plays a searching ball from right to left,
[600.96 - 605.20] P:1712.53 E:0.090879 |  far too far in behind the likes of Solanke and Madison. Four minutes have been played,
[605.20 - 610.00] P:1702.07 E:0.091947 |  it's still goalless, it's still all Spurs, and Southampton have got themselves another free kick
[610.00 - 616.24] P:1718.95 E:0.092718 |  Kyle Walker-Peters bundled to the ground again, this time by Lucas Bergval. Topman fans will have
[616.24 - 621.60] P:1598.26 E:0.095195 |  one eye on Tyler Dibbling, Stephen Kelly, because he's been linked with a move to north London this
[621.60 - 626.16] P:1522.62 E:0.104072 |  summer, though the figure that they're talking 100 million pounds. Oh yeah, it's ludicrous.
[626.16 - 629.36] P:1439.56 E:0.126482 |  I can't imagine Daniel Levy's going to pay that. No, I would have said you
[629.60 - 635.68] P:1640.08 E:0.103986 |  have. If all the teams teams in the league there, you feel may offer substantial place,
[635.68 - 640.16] P:1627.58 E:0.092275 |  it's not going to be Tottenham, is it? And he takes a lot of boxes for how Tottenham like to do
[640.16 - 646.96] P:1643.38 E:0.089923 |  business. Young player got Premier League experience, someone that can grow loads of energy, exciting,
[646.96 - 652.88] P:1515.85 E:0.091282 |  but would they be willing to shadow from after they brought in a good feel like Bergval, Gray,
[652.88 - 656.72] P:1266.51 E:0.098420 |  Odebrew, these young players that come into the side and France, they've all done really well.
[656.72 - 660.48] P:1508.85 E:0.095522 |  Do you want to add more of that into what is it already young side?
[661.44 - 666.40] P:1576.62 E:0.101350 |  They've probably all done really well for young footballers, rather than really well for a footballer
[666.40 - 670.00] P:1426.28 E:0.095059 |  that can come in and win now, which is what Tottenham fans are so desperate for.
[670.00 - 674.24] P:1475.77 E:0.097467 |  Yeah, that's exactly it. I think fans want something now and don't get me wrong. I think
[674.24 - 678.00] P:1450.52 E:0.096278 |  Bergval has been brilliant. I think Gray, when he's played, I think has played some wonderful
[678.00 - 683.60] P:1596.01 E:0.091319 |  positions, being played out of position so much as well. That's a good ball forwards from Romero.
[683.60 - 688.48] P:1792.77 E:0.097767 |  Good idea anyway. The execution was slightly off. He was looking for Pedro Porro up near the
[688.48 - 695.28] P:1678.30 E:0.083130 |  edge of the Southampton penalty area. Spurs recover possession once more near the halfway line. Porro
[695.28 - 699.60] P:1551.39 E:0.097490 |  on the ball, wins his side, a throw in directly in front of his manager, Ange Postacoglo. And how
[699.60 - 704.40] P:1779.68 E:0.100402 |  will he be feeling this afternoon? After everything that happened at Stamford Bridge on Thursday,
[704.40 - 708.80] P:1696.72 E:0.101874 |  the cupping of his ears in the direction of the traveling Tottenham Hotspur fans after they scored
[708.80 - 714.56] P:1621.29 E:0.094726 |  that goal that was then disallowed. Ange says there was no malice behind it, but he still did it.
[715.12 - 721.20] P:1553.26 E:0.095146 |  Yeah, listen, he's done it. He knows what he's done. I think he can try and downplay it as much
[721.20 - 727.28] P:1739.24 E:0.099148 |  as he can. But at that time, his managers would get frustrated. Brennan Johnson, edge of the penalty
[727.28 - 732.40] P:1495.61 E:0.106950 |  area down the right wing towards the byline. He's really well held up by Manning and Aribo and
[732.40 - 737.60] P:1680.45 E:0.113240 |  Manning try to win the ball back. The latter of those two throws himself to the ground and looks
[737.60 - 741.92] P:1481.11 E:0.098374 |  to grab the ball at the same time. Brennan Johnson has made very little contact with him, but it's
[741.92 - 747.28] P:1592.06 E:0.094137 |  directly in front of the assistant in the bottom right hand corner. The Southampton left and that
[747.28 - 752.08] P:1779.92 E:0.108013 |  will be a free kick. You don't like to see him given, but as a former fallback, former defender,
[752.08 - 756.32] P:1862.69 E:0.101273 |  I'm sure you've gone down for a few like that where you wait for a little bit of contacting
[756.32 - 759.44] P:1433.89 E:0.109733 |  your back, put yourself between ball and man. You probably couldn't possibly come.
[760.96 - 764.40] P:1396.67 E:0.117641 |  It's one of those things you develop on quite early, I think as you start playing, because
[764.40 - 768.96] P:1546.63 E:0.106074 |  you realise you're under pressure, you're facing your own goal, you're facing away from play,
[768.96 - 772.88] P:1669.83 E:0.094802 |  and what can you do? And as a player on the opposition team, you're like, don't touch him,
[772.88 - 778.64] P:1666.76 E:0.087906 |  don't touch him, don't give him that chance to go down. And you go and it's going to be a fail,
[778.64 - 781.84] P:1440.91 E:0.096973 |  it's going to give you a bit of a rest, but it go give you that chance to play out from the back.
[783.44 - 787.92] P:1679.66 E:0.102497 |  Goal is here, seven minutes on the clock. Goal is as well between Brentford and Chelsea, which is
[787.92 - 793.92] P:1564.66 E:0.103721 |  available to listen to on the BBC Sport website and nil nil between Fulham and Liverpool as
[793.92 - 799.92] P:1642.17 E:0.094131 |  Arnys Lots side continue to edge ever closer to a Premier League title of the Chukbu, back to
[799.92 - 806.56] P:1579.37 E:0.104479 |  Arun Ramsdale in a darker shade of pink, more of a lilac goalkeeping kit with a hint of purple.
[806.56 - 811.44] P:1813.47 E:0.093651 |  He'll hear the boos every time he picks it up for his former Arsenal days. Solanke,
[812.08 - 815.84] P:1631.39 E:0.099089 |  left wing, ten yards away from the penalty area, he'll find a short ball for Madison,
[815.84 - 821.04] P:1750.44 E:0.111431 |  and Madison will find Son Heung-min, plays it back towards Johnson, really good block
[821.12 - 825.52] P:1892.66 E:0.103902 |  from Manning, just as Brennan Johnson was about to pull the trigger from eight yards,
[825.52 - 830.00] P:1621.63 E:0.106549 |  Manning got himself in the way and it'll be a Tottenham hot spur throwing on the far side instead.
[830.00 - 834.00] P:1313.63 E:0.105347 |  It's great builder from Tottenham, Madison with a lovely ball behind the full back Walker
[834.00 - 838.64] P:1565.97 E:0.096856 |  Peters, his son comes onto it and he gets his head up, pulls it back into Johnson, but right
[838.64 - 844.00] P:1532.42 E:0.102154 |  Manning, the Irish full back comes in really strong, great block from him, Johnson centre of the goal,
[844.00 - 847.36] P:1417.82 E:0.101809 |  gets a decent connection on it, but Manning's right there to get that block on.
[847.36 - 853.76] P:1482.17 E:0.061379 |  That throwing taken from the far side, all the way back up in the direction of Ben Davis,
[853.76 - 858.72] P:1737.62 E:0.093025 |  now the Welshman back into the 11 this afternoon, as I mentioned for Tottenham hot spur,
[858.72 - 864.64] P:1688.73 E:0.095204 |  with Charleston back on the bench after his latest injury, as Porro tries to get the other side of
[864.64 - 870.08] P:1731.62 E:0.119817 |  Sulamana and does do eventually, does really well, turns, his cross is blocked, it'll be a first,
[870.08 - 877.28] P:1820.34 E:0.099147 |  Spurs corner in front of the wall and Pedro Porro shifts his arms up in the air and asks
[877.36 - 881.12] P:1521.28 E:0.107956 |  for more noise and more enthusiasm from those Spurs supporters.
[882.72 - 886.48] P:1371.36 E:0.121449 |  I always find that funny, yeah, I think you have to give a little bit more to want the fans to
[886.48 - 892.88] P:1538.75 E:0.103524 |  give you more. Porro will take the corner kick that he won, a right-footed out-swinging ball
[893.68 - 901.04] P:1808.60 E:0.100237 |  deep towards the edge of the six yard box, brilliant save, as Romero's head up went straight at Ramsdale,
[901.12 - 904.72] P:1766.93 E:0.107078 |  who bounced backwards as he pushed the ball away from harm's way.
[905.60 - 910.00] P:1821.27 E:0.100446 |  And maybe Romero should score, but Aaron Ramsdale makes an excellent save.
[910.00 - 914.72] P:1476.23 E:0.101141 |  Wonderful save from Ramsdale, it's point blank, it's straight at him, the ball in from Porro,
[914.72 - 920.64] P:1777.22 E:0.093593 |  wonderful corner and Romero appeals off, diving header straight in, but it's just too straight
[920.64 - 925.60] P:1646.24 E:0.093263 |  around Ramsdale. The power he generates is fantastic, but the trajectory is just down the
[925.68 - 931.68] P:1474.54 E:0.079625 |  line aside of Ramsdale who can punch it away. Excellent diving header, can there be a better
[931.68 - 938.96] P:1659.55 E:0.097695 |  site in football than a diving header that's met so meatily, but excellent save as well from Aaron
[938.96 - 943.76] P:1827.33 E:0.104858 |  Ramsdale and he's going to have to do it all again perhaps because Lucas Bergval is just won a second
[943.76 - 949.60] P:1664.73 E:0.104739 |  corner for Spurs in quick succession, played nearly 10 minutes, it's still 0-0, but it's all
[949.60 - 955.36] P:1676.61 E:0.089086 |  Tottenham hot spur, which I guess should come as no surprise, but when you consider that Southampton
[955.44 - 960.72] P:1567.89 E:0.109229 |  are playing today to avoid relegation and if they are relegated today will be the quickest
[960.72 - 966.16] P:1714.01 E:0.106722 |  Premier League side in history to be relegated, maybe you expect a little bit more as Porro's
[966.16 - 971.36] P:1687.50 E:0.090254 |  right-footed out swinger is this time headed up and away by Bednarak and helped on its way
[971.36 - 976.32] P:1486.45 E:0.087334 |  towards the halfway line by James Madison. Yeah, it's been a real tough start for Southampton,
[976.32 - 982.16] P:1658.83 E:0.096875 |  just stuck in their own half of their pitch, not being able to play out, any balls are trying to
[982.16 - 986.32] P:1705.68 E:0.097167 |  clear, just going straight to Tottenham like this and if you're Tottenham you'd be feeling so
[986.32 - 990.24] P:1652.69 E:0.096444 |  confident in your press that you can just go after them and win the ball back. Well you mentioned
[990.24 - 995.04] P:1572.40 E:0.105986 |  that it might be like a pre-season friendly, it's almost like a training ground exercise as Bergval
[995.04 - 1001.20] P:1885.54 E:0.096957 |  gets the other side of Johnson and Bergval with his left foot, never really catches hold of it from
[1001.20 - 1006.16] P:1701.19 E:0.110042 |  10 yards out, it all opened up to him, Aaron Ramsdale was stood waiting to make the save and in the
[1006.16 - 1010.40] P:1646.47 E:0.091472 |  end he could have thrown his proverbial cap on it. You know as he goes in it's lovely, just
[1010.40 - 1014.56] P:1747.10 E:0.098533 |  he's a little shimmy with his body but he can't get the touch with his left foot out to be able to
[1014.56 - 1019.04] P:1625.28 E:0.097193 |  make the contact he wants, it's stuck under his body and he ends up just rolling into the keeper,
[1019.04 - 1022.72] P:1733.08 E:0.097414 |  he just needs to take it away from his body slightly more so he can get more of it, more
[1022.72 - 1027.44] P:1702.80 E:0.099476 |  purchase on it. Tyler Dibbling just got his first touch of any real meaning and it's taken 11 minutes
[1027.44 - 1031.84] P:1791.06 E:0.099534 |  in this game, still goalless, nice ball from Fernandez from the heart of the pitch out to the
[1031.84 - 1036.32] P:1708.51 E:0.103299 |  right wing for Walker Peters and they attack the end where all the Southampton fans are gathered,
[1036.32 - 1041.44] P:1778.51 E:0.098548 |  here is Dibbling now, step into the penalty area, tiptoes towards the back posters across
[1041.44 - 1046.48] P:1956.50 E:0.110545 |  in the direction of Sulamana who really should score but Vicario makes a good point blank save
[1046.48 - 1051.44] P:1817.49 E:0.098422 |  and the danger not cleared yet as Fernandez picks up the ball, he's closed down by Brennan Johnson,
[1051.44 - 1056.16] P:1809.99 E:0.102176 |  back towards Manning, Manning's left footed ball had plenty of time to pick out his cross,
[1056.16 - 1061.36] P:1761.83 E:0.101703 |  it's headed away before it could reach anybody in pink and that was a really good move from South
[1061.36 - 1066.80] P:1651.51 E:0.096934 |  Hampton, curling ball towards the back post, Sulamana perhaps should do better Stephen Kelly.
[1066.80 - 1071.52] P:1532.41 E:0.107330 |  I think it's a great save from Vicario, comes off his foot onto the post and back out but
[1071.52 - 1077.92] P:1630.19 E:0.088191 |  if that doesn't sum Tottenham up in an instant of how their season has been totally dominated the
[1077.92 - 1081.36] P:1524.60 E:0.091347 |  game, loose possession once, one attack from South Hampton and they hit the post.
[1082.48 - 1085.76] P:1572.28 E:0.090501 |  Sulamana on the ball again for South Hampton down the left and now
[1086.88 - 1091.04] P:1762.92 E:0.100071 |  Tottenham Hossborough have gone into their shells somewhat, curling ball into the penalty area,
[1091.04 - 1096.00] P:1859.11 E:0.104408 |  Archer was trying to get there in front of Vicario but the Tottenham Hossborough goalkeeper
[1096.00 - 1101.60] P:1821.08 E:0.086334 |  came out dressed all in yellow and quickly gathered the possession and Spurs will take a breath and
[1101.60 - 1106.80] P:1700.87 E:0.084842 |  look to build again and look to get themselves back on top in this game as Madison finds some
[1106.80 - 1111.52] P:1699.56 E:0.105650 |  space on the halfway line, Son-Hum Min picks it up, approaching the edge of the penalty area,
[1111.52 - 1116.32] P:1861.13 E:0.126347 |  there's the overlap, Jed Spence back to Johnson, what a brilliant goal!
[1116.40 - 1124.24] P:1869.41 E:0.115732 |  Lightning quick from Tottenham Hossborough down the left hand side, all of their stars involved,
[1124.80 - 1130.48] P:1858.47 E:0.115892 |  Brennan Johnson running onto it, 10 yards out and picking out the top corner first time,
[1131.28 - 1136.64] P:1750.51 E:0.121692 |  13 minutes have been played, it's Tottenham Hossborough 1, South Hampton 0.
[1137.36 - 1143.28] P:1715.15 E:0.114545 |  From start to finish this goal is lizard with quality, Romero's pass into Madison in the space
[1143.28 - 1148.16] P:1621.27 E:0.107721 |  between the lines, Madison's touch finish and playing in the line to Spence and Son,
[1148.16 - 1153.68] P:1572.11 E:0.108894 |  wonderful play and this time Johnson the cutback is perfect and Manny Cantimus tackle
[1153.68 - 1158.24] P:1581.79 E:0.103959 |  and this time Johnson fires into the roof for net with a wonderful left-foot finish who
[1158.24 - 1163.60] P:1563.36 E:0.106367 |  Johnson has probably been Tottenham's most prolific player this season, missed a lot of games and
[1163.60 - 1169.84] P:1701.38 E:0.098646 |  you know in an instance it's changed but what a wonderful end-to-end goal from Spurs, slick passing
[1169.92 - 1175.52] P:1765.58 E:0.089299 |  with a wonderful finish. Well you talked about South Hampton being possibly looking at the
[1175.52 - 1181.20] P:1820.98 E:0.100285 |  counter attack today as their best option but Spurs there from one end to the other,
[1181.20 - 1187.36] P:1834.63 E:0.105193 |  just not a single error, not a pass goes wrong and the finish is just magnificent from Brennan
[1187.36 - 1191.68] P:1628.44 E:0.103100 |  Johnson, his 10th league goal of the season. It is, yeah, a sublime finish and but like I said
[1191.68 - 1197.20] P:1510.14 E:0.109859 |  at the start the pass from Romero out between the lines into Madison, he fended pocket of space,
[1197.28 - 1202.08] P:1626.42 E:0.098548 |  he just whipped it into him which was a great pass, Madison's touch and turn to find Son,
[1202.08 - 1208.40] P:1614.61 E:0.086194 |  excellent as well and then the cross, the head up, the puller back to Johnson but I think this
[1208.40 - 1214.88] P:1614.80 E:0.100518 |  game just screams of two teams who defensively are not confident in what they can do, Tottenham are
[1214.88 - 1219.36] P:1633.12 E:0.093144 |  the same, Tottenham are not confident in how strongly they can be defensive so Hampton are
[1219.36 - 1225.60] P:1739.66 E:0.087625 |  just struggling to do anything to stop the teams playing through the lines. Spurs leading against
[1225.68 - 1230.96] P:1705.96 E:0.099306 |  South Hampton then with 14 minutes on the clock by one goal to nil, Liverpool have just taken the
[1230.96 - 1237.68] P:1697.68 E:0.088004 |  lead at Craven Cottage, McAllister with the opener there. It's a free kick for South Hampton, 10 yards
[1237.68 - 1243.04] P:1681.77 E:0.092597 |  outside of the Spurs penalty area down the left wing, Ryan Manning is stood over the ball, he'll
[1243.04 - 1249.92] P:1758.50 E:0.072956 |  offer a left-footed out swinging cross as the first quarter of an hour is in the books. That ball
[1249.92 - 1255.20] P:1890.45 E:0.097983 |  flicked away towards the back post, Bednarek keeps it alive, now it falls to Archer, low left-footed
[1255.20 - 1263.04] P:1850.81 E:0.090935 |  shot is blocked out to Matias Fernandez, drags his effort goalwards but into the path of Uggachukwut
[1263.04 - 1268.40] P:1563.84 E:0.084840 |  who tried to divert it goalwards but in the end puts it well wide. No, he didn't know much about
[1268.40 - 1273.44] P:1631.33 E:0.101557 |  that as it came in but he wasn't offside, he was in a really good position and because he sees it
[1273.44 - 1279.84] P:1738.73 E:0.076534 |  so late can't direct the back towards goal. Spurs looking to build from the back and there are a
[1279.84 - 1284.88] P:1478.50 E:0.098031 |  few nervy ooze and arse as South Hampton put the press on, tried to play it away down the left
[1284.88 - 1290.32] P:1600.44 E:0.090022 |  but Dibbling intercepts for South Hampton and the Saints have it back, Bednarek, their skipper
[1290.32 - 1296.72] P:1630.43 E:0.075503 |  finds the youngster Dibbling once more. I mentioned Liverpool have taken the lead at Fulham, you can
[1296.72 - 1300.96] P:1490.60 E:0.096627 |  listen to that game on BBC Radio 5 Live in the company of Mark Scott and Clinton Morrison,
[1302.16 - 1308.56] P:1495.53 E:0.085378 |  also in west London, Brentford Nyl, Chelsea Nyl, that one with John Akers and the Colchester United
[1308.64 - 1315.36] P:1606.82 E:0.073259 |  striker Lyle Taylor. Dibbling on the halfway line finds Matthews Fernandez, Uggachukwut,
[1316.00 - 1321.76] P:1708.41 E:0.094483 |  misplaces his pass and puts it out for a throw in on the far touch line level with the halfway
[1321.76 - 1328.00] P:1648.63 E:0.082284 |  line for Angi-Poster Coglou's Tottenham Hotspur. A reminder, as things stand with South Hampton,
[1328.00 - 1333.68] P:1567.22 E:0.096283 |  one goal down, they will be relegated from the Premier League this afternoon, they will do so
[1333.68 - 1339.04] P:1766.00 E:0.087888 |  in record breakingly quick fashion. This is Game Week 31, no Premier League side has ever gone
[1339.04 - 1344.00] P:1678.59 E:0.096492 |  down this early, even the awful Derby team which currently holds the record, although that's on
[1344.00 - 1349.84] P:1720.06 E:0.090885 |  the threat at the moment from South Hampton, didn't get relegated until Game Week 32, they hold that
[1349.84 - 1355.92] P:1703.27 E:0.085977 |  record with Huddersfield Town as Tottenham Hotspur pick up the ball through James Madison, 30 yards
[1355.92 - 1361.04] P:1739.00 E:0.097891 |  from goal, he's fouled by Lesley Uggachukwut, thumps the ground in pain and it'll be a free kick
[1361.04 - 1365.28] P:1602.00 E:0.106056 |  in a dangerous area, it's a long way out but it's not too far out Steven Kelly to have a go at goal.
[1365.28 - 1371.68] P:1601.67 E:0.090426 |  No, my fanciest from this distance, really again, Madison is moving between the lines really
[1371.68 - 1376.96] P:1790.66 E:0.091423 |  around, receives this ball on the half turn, just shifts his body, Uggachukwut sweeps his leg and
[1376.96 - 1381.12] P:1462.80 E:0.096001 |  takes his calf out, but it's a great position for Madison and a lovely pass in, I think it's from
[1381.12 - 1385.84] P:1686.07 E:0.101237 |  Brennan Johnson in the first place, but Tottenham are starting to motor, they're just finding nicely
[1386.00 - 1387.84] P:1660.77 E:0.086738 |  in the middle of the pocket, nice passing lines.
[1388.48 - 1393.12] P:1669.81 E:0.090927 |  What an important couple of moments in the game, South Hampton going up one end and almost
[1393.12 - 1398.08] P:1639.61 E:0.095521 |  scoring in their own right through Cameldean's Sulamana, only for Vicario to make an excellent save,
[1398.08 - 1402.80] P:1745.42 E:0.099649 |  only for Spurs to go up the other end and immediately find a breakthrough. 17 minutes
[1402.80 - 1408.08] P:1538.39 E:0.094340 |  have been played, Spurs won South Hampton nil, that goal coming from Brennan Johnson, his 10th league
[1408.08 - 1413.04] P:1688.82 E:0.093355 |  goal of the season, the first Spurs player to enter double figures, Son Hyung-min turns the
[1413.04 - 1418.00] P:1348.37 E:0.094160 |  ball towards the back post, Benton Koo was the intended target, couldn't quite get on the end of
[1418.00 - 1423.60] P:1515.70 E:0.073816 |  it and Kyle Walker-Peters clears it long and up towards the halfway line. Yeah, but again,
[1423.60 - 1427.84] P:1510.93 E:0.107531 |  Lucas at Hampton when they clear their lines, it's just nobody, the whole team is back in the
[1427.84 - 1432.64] P:1625.33 E:0.083716 |  Fendham, which they probably rightly so, with a free kick, the position it's in, but when they
[1432.64 - 1437.84] P:1496.24 E:0.094558 |  play that ball forward, there's just no pass, there's no line as safe for anybody to find,
[1437.84 - 1442.96] P:1752.09 E:0.080484 |  it's just hopelessly clicked back into the Tottenham team. Bergwald does well, tries to win the
[1442.96 - 1446.96] P:1652.40 E:0.110986 |  ball back off of Manning, who stands strong, just about keeps hold of it, but then immediately
[1446.96 - 1452.24] P:1712.04 E:0.092980 |  concedes possession and it will be another Spurs free kick. As they kick from left to right in
[1452.24 - 1457.60] P:1629.70 E:0.083810 |  front of us, it's about three yards in from the near touch line. Opportunity to throw the slightly
[1457.60 - 1462.24] P:1595.23 E:0.091811 |  bigger men forwards, big men, I mean, there's a, they've got plenty of height in the team, but no
[1462.24 - 1467.60] P:1680.84 E:0.099638 |  giants, there is one giant here today, he's sat on the bench for Southampton, Paul Onowachi who scored
[1467.60 - 1472.56] P:1640.69 E:0.104203 |  two in his last two, picked up an ankle injury in their one all draw against Crystal Palace
[1473.76 - 1478.96] P:1635.66 E:0.105731 |  four days ago, and is only fit enough for a place on the substitutes bench where he'll also find Ross
[1478.96 - 1483.84] P:1600.68 E:0.101640 |  Stewart, another striker, my goodness, he's had his injuries back in a squad for the first time
[1483.84 - 1489.20] P:1585.80 E:0.108026 |  since October, ball curled in, so was the back post, Ramsdale comes out, flies and puts his
[1489.20 - 1494.64] P:1514.61 E:0.105356 |  right fist in the air and pours it away for a Tottenham throwing on the far touch line, around
[1494.64 - 1498.08] P:1591.76 E:0.107827 |  10 yards up the line from the far corner flag.
[1500.48 - 1504.40] P:1544.52 E:0.121059 |  We're currently advertising here at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium that Beyonce's coming in this
[1504.40 - 1508.56] P:1467.24 E:0.110728 |  summer, and I know that some of the Spurs fans were singing outside the ground whether or not could
[1508.56 - 1514.24] P:1606.50 E:0.114083 |  she play up front. They've not struggled to score goals, Spurs, it's kind of more at the other end.
[1514.24 - 1518.56] P:1496.11 E:0.115409 |  Sticker, I don't say, Sticker said they're back and see what happens. That'd be a position you want
[1518.56 - 1521.92] P:1242.75 E:0.110022 |  to see, you know, stop, stop or maybe a holding with field roll.
[1523.60 - 1528.56] P:1647.17 E:0.104861 |  Jay Z at right fallback. James Madison picks it up, gives it to Bergwald, takes a touch away
[1528.56 - 1532.64] P:1743.69 E:0.113651 |  from a couple of Southampton players, goes down referee, plays the advantage. Brennan
[1532.64 - 1537.44] P:1820.92 E:0.108743 |  Johnson has it on the right, low crosses blocked behind for a third Spurs corner of the game,
[1537.44 - 1540.64] P:1771.89 E:0.107822 |  nearly 20 minutes gone, continuing to lead by one goal to nil.
[1541.60 - 1548.32] P:1678.17 E:0.089825 |  I really like Bergwald. He flies into tackles, he puts pressure on teams, so full of energy,
[1548.32 - 1552.32] P:1583.78 E:0.098712 |  and then he's got a little bit of quality as well. But for a young, he's 19 years of age.
[1553.52 - 1557.44] P:1784.01 E:0.114409 |  Spurs fans like him as well. They booed the substitution, of course, on Thursday evening
[1557.44 - 1562.56] P:1733.69 E:0.091275 |  when he was withdrawn and they brought Papsar on. And of course Papsar then scored the goal that led
[1562.56 - 1567.20] P:1492.01 E:0.098022 |  to the cupping of his ears from Angiopasta Coglu as Pedro Porro picks it up and finds Johnson on
[1567.20 - 1572.24] P:1679.32 E:0.106742 |  the right side of the area again. Good header away and behind by Harwood Bellis, joined from
[1572.24 - 1578.24] P:1728.01 E:0.100931 |  Manchester City's Academy. Last summer, £20m he cost after a season-long low
[1578.32 - 1582.96] P:1734.71 E:0.100627 |  in the championship where they won promotion, of course, and will be returning to at the
[1582.96 - 1589.76] P:1644.31 E:0.096062 |  conclusion of this game today, should things stay the same. Fourth corner in the first 21 minutes,
[1589.76 - 1594.88] P:1599.87 E:0.092192 |  Pedro Porro, again the man to take it. Right-footed out-swinger runs all the way through towards
[1594.88 - 1599.36] P:1728.79 E:0.092167 |  Dibbling on the edge of the box. Southampton think about trying to clear the ball away.
[1599.36 - 1603.52] P:1689.78 E:0.102116 |  Dibbling tries to keep a hold of it, goes down in a heap, wants the referee to bail him out
[1603.60 - 1608.16] P:1655.01 E:0.093816 |  and give him a free kick. That might well be handballed, though against Sun Hyunmin, it is,
[1608.16 - 1612.64] P:1426.81 E:0.103107 |  and Southampton will now be bailed out with a free kick. It's interesting, is it? So Sun gets
[1612.64 - 1617.04] P:1468.08 E:0.102034 |  penalised for a ball and smashed against him from Mjärvöe. Dibbling goes down and basically
[1617.04 - 1621.28] P:1388.86 E:0.097872 |  cups the ball with his stomach to stop them getting away because he falls on top of it,
[1621.28 - 1626.24] P:1548.30 E:0.099794 |  and that doesn't get penalised. We keep talking about cups and cupping in the first 21 minutes
[1626.24 - 1631.68] P:1764.87 E:0.097121 |  of the game here. Tottenham still leading on BBC Radio 5, Sports Extra. Angiopasta Coglu,
[1631.68 - 1637.20] P:1623.24 E:0.108342 |  of course, famously now, might even put an in in front of famously, infamously, declaring that he
[1637.20 - 1644.64] P:1582.20 E:0.090654 |  always wins a cup in his second season in charge somewhere, I saw a write-up note down that the
[1644.64 - 1650.08] P:1646.25 E:0.086741 |  only cups that Tottenham Hotspur might be winning at the moment are the, well, the cups around his
[1650.08 - 1655.44] P:1754.20 E:0.093651 |  ears from Thursday evening as Jed Spence picks up the ball approaching the halfway line. They
[1655.44 - 1659.76] P:1680.97 E:0.105436 |  enter, of course, on Thursday evening the Europa League quarterfinals, which their season really
[1659.76 - 1665.76] P:1708.51 E:0.086829 |  now hinges on against Eintracht Frankfurt here at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. We'll have updates
[1665.76 - 1671.84] P:1626.18 E:0.096401 |  on that one into live commentary of Lyon against Manchester United in another Europa League quarter
[1671.84 - 1679.52] P:1789.92 E:0.066599 |  final, and following Thursday as Vicarios closed down by Archer. Spurs will travel to Germany for
[1679.52 - 1686.88] P:1670.86 E:0.065845 |  the second leg. Clearance away from Porro, can only find Harwood Bellis wearing a tight black
[1686.96 - 1692.80] P:1613.17 E:0.084631 |  headband to keep his hair in place this afternoon in the North London sunshine. Tyler Dibbling picks
[1692.80 - 1698.08] P:1694.95 E:0.097959 |  it up, has the overlap from Kyle Walker-Peters chooses not to use that, and instead they'll work it
[1698.08 - 1704.00] P:1812.26 E:0.092016 |  back across the defensive line. Joe Aribo will now take over. Southampton have lost
[1704.96 - 1711.52] P:1775.18 E:0.095979 |  five of their last six away games, six matches without a win in total since their 2-1 victory
[1711.60 - 1718.32] P:1773.72 E:0.082092 |  at Ipswich in early February. Nearly 23 minutes on the clock here. Kyle Walker-Peters puts his foot
[1718.32 - 1725.04] P:1738.07 E:0.083005 |  on the ball and tries to find Archer. Nowhere near doing so, and Tottenham Hotspur recover possession
[1725.04 - 1729.92] P:1738.14 E:0.091060 |  again, and we're talking before the game, Stephen Kelly, about the importance of trying to build a
[1729.92 - 1734.80] P:1707.82 E:0.089338 |  little bit of confidence from a Spurs perspective ahead of going into such an important game,
[1734.80 - 1740.72] P:1764.54 E:0.077469 |  like they have on Thursday evening here in the Europa League. Yeah, absolutely. I said to Hampton,
[1740.72 - 1744.56] P:1348.73 E:0.114455 |  being the worst team in the league this season, but there's fundamentals they could put in play
[1744.56 - 1750.08] P:1710.33 E:0.114330 |  today like that, pressing the team at the right time, getting them up to pitch. All that organisation
[1750.08 - 1753.84] P:1530.86 E:0.108203 |  and things that Tottenham have kind of fallen away from, to try and get them back in play in this
[1753.84 - 1758.72] P:1514.32 E:0.091871 |  game with as many players performing to a decent level, then to go into Thursday feeling right,
[1758.72 - 1762.80] P:1558.67 E:0.088990 |  we've got the hang of this. Awkward ball back for Aaron Ramsdale, which is what you could hear,
[1762.80 - 1766.96] P:1468.93 E:0.116708 |  the delighted cheers from the Tottenham Hotspur fans in the wall behind that goal,
[1767.52 - 1771.92] P:1731.58 E:0.090998 |  celebrating the fact that Ramsdale was finding life difficult there for a moment.
[1771.92 - 1778.72] P:1807.65 E:0.076454 |  Still 1-0 to Spurs. That goal coming through. Brennan Johnson in the 13th minute,
[1778.72 - 1783.68] P:1511.62 E:0.087938 |  Bergvale picks it up now, number 15 on his back, bright blonde Disney character like here.
[1784.24 - 1789.28] P:1671.10 E:0.098747 |  That's neat defending at the back from Jan Bednarek, who chests the ball out of harm's way. It's now
[1789.28 - 1794.24] P:1680.16 E:0.106855 |  with Cameldean Sulamane, who gets his pocket picked by Bergvale, but does well to recover the play
[1794.24 - 1799.52] P:1582.87 E:0.099114 |  before Spurs could do any more damage. Fernandez finds a Rebo near the halfway line on the left
[1799.52 - 1805.36] P:1733.57 E:0.101269 |  wing in front of what looks to be a very excited, even Eureich, the Southampton coach.
[1806.32 - 1810.16] P:1662.11 E:0.098079 |  He laughs at the idea that he should stay inside his technical area. I don't think I've ever seen
[1810.16 - 1816.00] P:1752.67 E:0.094796 |  him confined by white lines, marching up and down, constantly clapping and encouraging his
[1816.00 - 1820.64] P:1784.42 E:0.097680 |  players. Fulham have equalised at Craven Cottage, Ryan Cessignon, it's 1-0 there now,
[1820.64 - 1826.88] P:1811.12 E:0.094896 |  Fulham won Liverpool won the games on BBC Radio 5 Live for you here on BBC Radio 5. Sports extra
[1826.88 - 1833.44] P:1691.64 E:0.095831 |  1-0 to Spurs against Southampton, who I reiterate will be relegated if the scores stay like this
[1833.44 - 1841.04] P:1476.25 E:0.060954 |  at the conclusion of this game. It's Romero who picks it up for Spurs at the back, heart of the
[1841.68 - 1848.88] P:1756.98 E:0.066576 |  defence. One of several key Spurs players that have had their injuries this season,
[1848.88 - 1853.92] P:1769.40 E:0.083398 |  missed three months with a hamstring problem. There is talk that he might be leaving North
[1853.92 - 1859.68] P:1546.15 E:0.084966 |  London in the summer as Madison turns away from Ogachukwu, gets tugged back and that will be
[1859.68 - 1865.84] P:1688.22 E:0.103379 |  a Spurs free kick and a first yellow card of the afternoon. It goes to Leslie Ogachukwu.
[1865.84 - 1870.88] P:1572.44 E:0.105593 |  Yeah, it's the second tour time maybe Madison has received the ball on that back foot. Really good
[1870.88 - 1876.40] P:1713.13 E:0.095511 |  awareness from him looking over his shoulder and then just rolls Ogachukwu, who fells him again.
[1876.40 - 1880.88] P:1657.57 E:0.087874 |  This time it's a little bit too far out to maybe contemplate the shop of Madison.
[1880.88 - 1884.72] P:1701.30 E:0.092676 |  Like I said, his positioning today has been very good. Just as basically he found you,
[1884.72 - 1888.80] P:1580.52 E:0.094824 |  you want to get back to James Madison being that industrial player in the middle of the park,
[1888.80 - 1893.84] P:1785.88 E:0.082838 |  finding spaces, head on a swivel turning, making things happen. And I said that for
[1893.84 - 1898.88] P:1567.57 E:0.091801 |  Tottenham, too many players have been off their game and you want to get them back before this last
[1898.88 - 1904.72] P:1769.59 E:0.080336 |  push. Two brilliant footballers stood over this free kick, which is fully 30 yards. Madison rolls
[1904.72 - 1909.44] P:1757.60 E:0.081343 |  it to Sun, Sun Square across the edge of the penalty area in the direction of Poro, puts the
[1909.44 - 1915.60] P:1859.17 E:0.101710 |  ball onto his left foot, ball to the back post, another diving head up and again brilliantly saved
[1915.60 - 1923.04] P:1824.29 E:0.092335 |  by Arum Ramsdale. It's Ramero once more at the back post, flying through the air, sticks his head
[1923.04 - 1928.96] P:1708.14 E:0.101933 |  on it from around three yards out, albeit at an acute angle. But the Southampton shot stopper,
[1928.96 - 1934.08] P:1659.58 E:0.099940 |  Arum Ramsdale, once more, makes a crucial stop for his side. It is, it's point blank again.
[1934.08 - 1938.56] P:1722.26 E:0.107921 |  Ramero is just all action, isn't he, when he's going through the ball and everything is just so
[1938.56 - 1943.84] P:1215.38 E:0.109943 |  flung. This time really good balling from Poro to the far post and Ramero throws himself out of a
[1943.84 - 1948.72] P:1517.14 E:0.101123 |  diving header all of our two or three yards away from Arum Ramsdale, who point blank save, gets it
[1948.72 - 1953.68] P:1625.36 E:0.099609 |  away and keeps him in it. Well, they talk about using your head as a footballer. Arum Ramsdale has
[1953.68 - 1958.88] P:1746.56 E:0.086645 |  done exactly that. He's saved that, perhaps not so much with his head with his face, which is why
[1958.88 - 1965.36] P:1594.96 E:0.088188 |  he's now lying sprawled on his back. It's a brilliant save because he makes himself big
[1965.36 - 1970.32] P:1732.65 E:0.094461 |  and he pucks his head in harm's way. Didn't know a huge amount about it, but right place,
[1970.32 - 1974.72] P:1756.65 E:0.102752 |  right time Arum Ramsdale keeps the score at just one nil spurs. If you're off the vintage and you're
[1974.72 - 1980.80] P:1626.07 E:0.095218 |  looking for a description of this, it's a full Peter Smeichel spread legs, wide arms, head up and he
[1980.80 - 1984.72] P:1531.19 E:0.096168 |  takes it straight in the face. Again, it's a wonderful header from Arumero, but just point
[1984.72 - 1989.28] P:1600.68 E:0.085678 |  blank straight down the line and if Ram's head is very brave getting out there, doesn't he?
[1989.84 - 1992.56] P:1620.35 E:0.095105 |  What do they call it? The starfish or something like that? Starfish, yeah.
[1993.44 - 2000.08] P:1654.49 E:0.096309 |  So spurs won Southampton nil here on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra for you with Craven Cottage on BBC
[2000.08 - 2006.80] P:1829.02 E:0.094566 |  Radio 5 Live. It's full of one Liverpool one on the BBC Sport website, Brentford nil, Chelsea nil,
[2006.88 - 2014.96] P:1748.31 E:0.091965 |  Stiltsacom, later on 430, the Manchester Derby, United against City, Live on 5 Live, 430,
[2014.96 - 2019.68] P:1717.23 E:0.096829 |  kickoff John Murray and Leon Osmond with you for that one. Of course, match of the day two with
[2019.68 - 2025.28] P:1757.95 E:0.087598 |  you this evening as well. And then tomorrow, the Monday nightclub will return with Mark Chapman,
[2025.28 - 2031.12] P:1763.05 E:0.084953 |  who's joined by Chris Sutton, Rory Smith and Duncan Ferguson. And then we kick off Masters Week,
[2031.12 - 2035.36] P:1580.89 E:0.104168 |  live from Augusta in the United States, ahead of the first golfing major of the year. We've got
[2035.36 - 2041.92] P:1813.51 E:0.087807 |  commentary live from Augusta National across 5 Live, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. That's starting
[2041.92 - 2048.80] P:1602.47 E:0.086964 |  Thursday at eight o'clock and there will be plenty of build up between now and then across the BBC.
[2048.80 - 2056.32] P:1682.31 E:0.079761 |  Aaron Ramsdale's okay, he's back up on his feet again, sore face I'm sure, but okay. And the score,
[2056.32 - 2062.64] P:1654.43 E:0.088533 |  thanks to him and practically nothing else, Stephen Kelly, is still spurs won Southampton nil,
[2062.96 - 2066.64] P:1630.61 E:0.090953 |  Son Humein has been kicked to the ground. There'll be a free kick 10 yards inside
[2066.64 - 2071.76] P:1627.97 E:0.082289 |  of Southampton territory. Yeah, Tottenham just totally dominated this game. It doesn't mean
[2071.76 - 2076.48] P:1662.94 E:0.087562 |  Southampton won't get a chance because even though Tottenham have barely lost possession,
[2076.48 - 2080.72] P:1654.54 E:0.096166 |  you still feel Southampton will get a shot on target somewhere there, which is the crazy scenario
[2080.72 - 2084.96] P:1591.57 E:0.098166 |  you think they're in. But Tottenham have handled it really well, moving the ball well, pressing
[2084.96 - 2091.36] P:1732.42 E:0.071362 |  really high up the pitch, creating a number of chances. Jed Spence has it for spurs just outside
[2091.36 - 2096.08] P:1708.57 E:0.097706 |  of the Southampton penalty area, short ball for Madison, and the Chukro goes across and
[2096.80 - 2106.24] P:1643.38 E:0.079099 |  sees the ball shepherded behind for Southampton goal kick. What a season they have endured Southampton.
[2107.20 - 2113.76] P:1679.02 E:0.092737 |  They are 13 points worse now than they were at the same stage of their last relegation season
[2113.76 - 2120.96] P:1694.64 E:0.097567 |  two years ago. No clean sheet in any of their last 13 matches and statistically speaking,
[2120.96 - 2126.48] P:1705.78 E:0.097943 |  they are the worst home team, the worst away team. They score the fewest goals and they concede
[2126.48 - 2132.96] P:1479.04 E:0.080435 |  the most goals going into this afternoon. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why they are 20th
[2132.96 - 2138.40] P:1706.68 E:0.091296 |  in the Premier League and will be relegated should the stores stay the same. It will be a Southampton
[2138.40 - 2142.32] P:1454.76 E:0.101175 |  free kick in the middle of their own half. It's a fascinating thing, isn't it, to look at both
[2142.32 - 2148.56] P:1612.14 E:0.082874 |  these teams who have got a lot of, I suppose, a lot of criticism for not being able to adapt
[2148.56 - 2153.20] P:1598.91 E:0.097344 |  their styles of play throughout the season. Tottenham were two gung-ho playing games without
[2153.20 - 2157.52] P:1658.78 E:0.089231 |  having the players they needed, the van de Venze or Amaro at the back and they're playing this
[2157.52 - 2162.96] P:1724.69 E:0.087586 |  high line. So, Southampton playing out from the back, particularly trying to pass the ball and
[2162.96 - 2168.48] P:1660.12 E:0.086772 |  giving teams opportunities to press them and lose it. And at what point in the season do you think
[2168.48 - 2171.92] P:1454.46 E:0.095679 |  this needs to change? So, Southampton relegated. Tottenham are about to have one of the worst
[2171.92 - 2176.00] P:1745.94 E:0.087041 |  seasons in the Premier League history. Should it have changed at some point in the season? Should
[2176.00 - 2181.12] P:1609.05 E:0.093348 |  the managers have been able to identify that and then rectify it or at least tweak something
[2181.12 - 2186.16] P:1671.62 E:0.072638 |  to make them more resilient? Half an hour been played. Spurs won Southampton,
[2186.16 - 2191.92] P:1611.43 E:0.094727 |  Neil Glorious, Blue Sky sitting above us here in North London up to my right, the Golden Cockroil,
[2191.92 - 2197.68] P:1844.29 E:0.091353 |  looking resplendent. Directly in front of us is a pale ghostly moon and there's just a couple of
[2197.68 - 2204.00] P:1793.66 E:0.085099 |  aeroplanes making their way over the top of the nation's capital. As Spurs look to try and end the
[2204.00 - 2210.08] P:1768.28 E:0.082373 |  season with something to smile about, the biggest chance of having a grin this year will be what
[2210.08 - 2215.52] P:1698.26 E:0.094118 |  they can do in the Europa League. Eintracht Frankfurt visitors here on Thursday evening.
[2215.52 - 2220.72] P:1673.74 E:0.091045 |  Karl Walker-Peters meanwhile on the ball toiling away in his own corner in the right full back
[2220.72 - 2228.88] P:1687.09 E:0.075892 |  area for Southampton. And he wins a throw-in off of Sun Hyeong-min who loves playing against the Saints,
[2228.88 - 2237.44] P:1546.42 E:0.094176 |  has 21 goal contributions in 18 games against Southampton, 13 goals, 8 assists, that's more goals
[2237.44 - 2242.72] P:1411.40 E:0.098963 |  and more assists than against any other side that he's ever played against. I think only
[2242.72 - 2247.60] P:1609.13 E:0.103390 |  Mo Salah has a higher goal involvement rate against Manchester United in all of
[2247.60 - 2254.08] P:1740.74 E:0.096561 |  current Premier League players as an awkward and harem-scare and ball is sent across the face of
[2254.08 - 2258.64] P:1660.54 E:0.088848 |  the Southampton goal. They will say that it was full of composure and they were able to clear it
[2258.64 - 2262.96] P:1571.08 E:0.096789 |  away down the left-hand side but they still have conceded possession and it's Pedro Porro
[2262.96 - 2268.24] P:1748.32 E:0.102092 |  battling to get the other side of Matias Fernandez. Down he goes, free kick Spurs about four or five
[2268.24 - 2273.12] P:1542.02 E:0.098519 |  yards outside of the Southampton penalty area. It's Rinsome repeat really isn't it Stephen Kelly?
[2273.12 - 2277.76] P:1584.89 E:0.086920 |  It's just mentioned earlier like a training ground exercise. I think Southampton have had
[2277.76 - 2283.20] P:1451.40 E:0.099150 |  one attack and typical two Spurs they nearly scored from it but they've had one attack all game
[2283.20 - 2287.28] P:1487.83 E:0.097833 |  otherwise it's just been attacking. You know this every single time Southampton get the ball and try to
[2287.28 - 2292.08] P:1696.41 E:0.085611 |  play it to the wide areas that are in the middle of park the Tottenham fullbacks are so high and
[2292.08 - 2296.80] P:1673.47 E:0.088980 |  they're on the full foot they're not allowed to turn whereas you look at the Southampton wingers
[2296.80 - 2302.80] P:1600.33 E:0.085729 |  they look lazy they look they're just down they're just down it's very hard to be motivated it's very
[2302.80 - 2308.32] P:1667.27 E:0.088254 |  hard to lift yourself up from what they've experienced all the season so they're just expecting it to come.
[2308.32 - 2314.00] P:1636.97 E:0.086930 |  Down emotionally down literally Pedro Porro right footed crossed towards the back post it
[2314.00 - 2321.44] P:1833.72 E:0.114386 |  forced a Bergvale and Spurs doubled their lead a right footed ball into the penalty area kept alive
[2321.44 - 2327.28] P:1804.97 E:0.111079 |  the likes of Davis and Benton Kern nodded it back across goal it fell to Lucas Bergvale and from
[2327.28 - 2332.88] P:1735.85 E:0.114477 |  around eight or nine yards out first time with his right foot he diverted it across the goal
[2332.88 - 2337.28] P:1714.77 E:0.110547 |  and into the bottom corner of the net it's Tottenham hot spur to Southampton nil.
[2337.28 - 2341.12] P:1557.78 E:0.119456 |  You can tell the Tottenham fans if all the players in the pitch he's one of the ones they
[2341.12 - 2346.00] P:1634.11 E:0.108785 |  would have wanted to score it's a bit fortunate Knox back in doesn't really know much about
[2346.00 - 2350.56] P:1556.70 E:0.107008 |  when it hits his foot and just goes past Ron's down into that far corner but a wonderful ball
[2350.56 - 2357.52] P:1681.77 E:0.091401 |  in from Porro he gets headed back into position from Romero or Davis comes back across and again
[2357.52 - 2362.56] P:1695.00 E:0.094327 |  he just fleek he just sticks his foot out comes off it unfortunately for him ends with the back
[2362.56 - 2367.52] P:1584.67 E:0.099692 |  in that but you can tell that meant a lot to the Spurs fans because he's one that's really
[2367.52 - 2373.44] P:1761.63 E:0.094217 |  they've taken to their heart. Yeah 19 year old sweet that is first Premier League goal he scored
[2373.44 - 2380.64] P:1725.69 E:0.098463 |  against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup in January in that 1-0 win here and he doubles Spurs lead
[2380.64 - 2385.44] P:1674.70 E:0.099553 |  they lead by two goals to nil and I dare say Stephen Kelly this won't be the last time that
[2385.44 - 2390.16] P:1734.52 E:0.109188 |  we use this expression this afternoon it certainly won't be the last time as there is a VAR check
[2390.16 - 2396.56] P:1608.32 E:0.084210 |  going on for a possible offside but if if this goal stands that is a nail in Southampton's coffin.
[2396.56 - 2402.56] P:1462.81 E:0.092078 |  Yeah I as much as I actually want to say you 100% it is a nail in their coffin this is given
[2403.20 - 2409.12] P:1519.07 E:0.097279 |  but this is taught them and this is taught them this season and I as a Spurs fan as the next Spurs
[2409.12 - 2413.36] P:1385.59 E:0.095466 |  player I find it very hard to get my head around the fact that they can't give goals away at the
[2413.36 - 2419.60] P:1680.10 E:0.083720 |  stage so I'm not I'm not counting my chickens before they've hatched yet. It's very very tight
[2420.16 - 2426.72] P:1666.81 E:0.092665 |  it's all about this offside decision whether or not I think Leslie Yogi Chukru and his left foot
[2426.72 - 2433.12] P:1652.30 E:0.091555 |  is playing on a couple of Spurs players at the far post but it's very very tight and let me just
[2433.12 - 2439.52] P:1756.05 E:0.106243 |  glance down to Ang Poste Coglu who had a lot to say about VAR on Thursday evening after their goal
[2439.52 - 2446.16] P:1788.48 E:0.105264 |  at Stamford Bridge was ruled out he said he hates VAR to its very core he told us on BBC Radio 5
[2446.40 - 2450.56] P:1574.97 E:0.097090 |  Exactly that looks like they're offside if you look at the the reverse angle I don't know
[2450.56 - 2455.20] P:1691.43 E:0.094054 |  where that's sped up and further ahead but an angle has just come up on the monitors for us and
[2455.84 - 2459.92] P:1577.05 E:0.106545 |  if that's the angle they're going off the Tottenham players looks offside. It's Romero isn't it who's
[2459.92 - 2464.88] P:1662.64 E:0.109068 |  kind of leaning forwards and then there's also Ben Davis at the back post who's also leaning but
[2464.88 - 2470.08] P:1659.75 E:0.099583 |  sticking his left arm out. Is this not if it's not clear and obvious the goal stands why why is
[2470.08 - 2474.32] P:1637.11 E:0.108495 |  this why are we having this debate if they can't decide in the first 20 seconds he's offside then
[2474.32 - 2480.08] P:1757.22 E:0.096074 |  he's offside. Well to to that end I thought this exactly as the goal went in so I checked the
[2480.08 - 2486.16] P:1738.18 E:0.090876 |  exact time that the goal went in and that is now two and a half minutes ago now the the check at
[2486.16 - 2491.76] P:1565.14 E:0.095609 |  Stamford Bridge took six minutes the other night. But like the thought of some guy in it in an office
[2491.76 - 2496.08] P:1548.05 E:0.117000 |  somewhere in a room trying to get a line out on protractor to try and see who the angles and see
[2496.08 - 2501.12] P:1683.57 E:0.101707 |  what's going on it's just ludicrous if you can't see it straight away what on field decisions
[2501.20 - 2505.92] P:1673.77 E:0.113974 |  should count. This is the last round of fixtures in the Premier League where semi-automatic off
[2505.92 - 2512.80] P:1814.65 E:0.108081 |  sides are not involved they will be introduced in time for game week 32 and the idea of the
[2512.80 - 2517.68] P:1721.09 E:0.101161 |  semi-automated offside is that it it's not going to make anything more accurate because they've
[2517.68 - 2523.12] P:1653.03 E:0.099050 |  been 100% accurate all season long but it is expected to cut the time down that a decision takes
[2523.12 - 2530.16] P:1567.00 E:0.098340 |  massively. But if you can't see it instantly then it's crazy like we have microphones here and
[2530.24 - 2540.32] P:1712.42 E:0.104349 |  we're commenting I want a boo as well. There are plenty of boo's you might as well join in as
[2540.32 - 2545.60] P:1740.01 E:0.108940 |  everywhere we look around us we're all shaking our heads it's an incredibly tight decision
[2546.40 - 2551.84] P:1673.43 E:0.103682 |  with several players it's all about Leslie Ogachukwu's left foot and whether or not Davis
[2551.84 - 2557.44] P:1692.74 E:0.102984 |  and Romero are leaning past that line that Ogachukwu is creating. So the angle we have now
[2557.44 - 2561.84] P:1547.08 E:0.098483 |  I'm saying they're on side but if you reverse the angle they look well off they look off so
[2561.84 - 2568.32] P:1736.71 E:0.100409 |  which one are they going on and how this is crazy absolutely nonsensical. It's been four
[2568.32 - 2575.04] P:1788.99 E:0.095316 |  minutes now if it takes this long. And Shpasta Koglu hands in his pockets he now takes them out
[2575.04 - 2579.92] P:1786.64 E:0.103325 |  and crosses his arms and even from all the way up here I could see that he puffs out his cheeks.
[2579.92 - 2585.92] P:1719.10 E:0.111091 |  How much would you love it if you cup this ear? Just like his mouth. He's smiling he's now covering
[2586.00 - 2592.32] P:1697.92 E:0.113317 |  his eyes he's covering his watch so that he's not counting. He's doing rock, paper, scissors as if
[2592.32 - 2597.04] P:1726.32 E:0.108448 |  this is what's going to make the decision. Look at him he's actually comical. He is quite literally
[2597.04 - 2602.48] P:1669.38 E:0.107224 |  doing rock, paper, scissors with himself. Here comes the decision. No roll. The referee this
[2602.48 - 2609.20] P:1752.37 E:0.106639 |  afternoon Michael Salisbury has drawn the imaginary TV line and discounted the goal.
[2609.20 - 2617.84] P:1746.05 E:0.095254 |  Four offside it took over five minutes just three days after Tottenham had a goal ruled out at
[2617.84 - 2625.36] P:1619.71 E:0.087267 |  Stanford Bridge which took six minutes. This one's taken five. It's ridiculous. We shouldn't be like
[2625.36 - 2631.12] P:1539.78 E:0.106995 |  Vars should be better for the league. Vars should cut out all these silly instances but if something
[2631.12 - 2636.72] P:1644.46 E:0.113207 |  is that tight then why does the unfair they should have a I'd love to see a countdown clock in the
[2636.72 - 2666.72] P:1637.11 E:0.103749 |  Vars studio just ticking away. Sweepy just the forehead and then after 20 seconds OK
[2666.72 - 2669.18] P:1815.67 E:0.105013 |  the next two games. I'm going
[2669.72 - 2670.78] P:1702.21 E:0.070654 |  to watch in later and say so,
[2670.88 - 2673.24] P:1185.49 E:0.089802 |  And what do you think about V
[2673.34 - 2674.32] P:1749.77 E:0.094459 |  AR? Good luck to you, Henry.
[2674.42 - 2676.28] P:1293.94 E:0.116941 |  Yeah, I think I'd like to be
[2676.38 - 2678.24] P:1501.02 E:0.067138 |  present for that. Just to see
[2678.34 - 2680.24] P:1554.73 E:0.090710 |  what happens on this about
[2680.34 - 2682.24] P:1504.20 E:0.090467 |  later on BBC sounds. It's
[2682.34 - 2683.74] P:1179.83 E:0.102214 |  crazy. You know, actually, what
[2683.84 - 2685.54] P:1481.08 E:0.075917 |  the funny thing about the
[2685.64 - 2686.24] P:1739.05 E:0.104758 |  Chelsea game for me is that
[2686.34 - 2689.08] P:1349.91 E:0.103116 |  after all the bar decisions
[2689.18 - 2690.14] P:1576.31 E:0.113731 |  after all these eight times.
[2690.24 - 2691.08] P:1494.71 E:0.109926 |  And post a code that didn't
[2691.18 - 2693.78] P:1666.27 E:0.080114 |  have the know how not to
[2693.88 - 2696.12] P:1498.47 E:0.099924 |  celebrate a var go until the
[2696.12 - 2698.14] P:1586.91 E:0.101048 |  end of the season. And then
[2698.24 - 2700.14] P:1545.47 E:0.110677 |  we have the BBC Radio five
[2700.24 - 2701.64] P:1982.06 E:0.109862 |  live where there's a long ball
[2701.74 - 2703.14] P:1795.49 E:0.085638 |  over the top. Archer
[2703.24 - 2704.64] P:1469.45 E:0.121555 |  challenges for it. Vicario
[2704.74 - 2706.64] P:1917.23 E:0.101469 |  comes out and grabs it at the
[2706.74 - 2708.24] P:1426.78 E:0.116914 |  second or third attempt.
[2708.34 - 2709.84] P:1588.45 E:0.108305 |  Liverpool had led full and by
[2709.94 - 2710.84] P:2045.42 E:0.111873 |  one goal to know. But by what
[2710.94 - 2713.84] P:1857.24 E:0.088268 |  while we were discussing the
[2713.94 - 2714.84] P:1595.34 E:0.087568 |  virtues of VAR here, Fullham
[2714.94 - 2716.84] P:1808.06 E:0.072826 |  have turned it around. They've
[2716.94 - 2718.84] P:1280.18 E:0.099424 |  scored a second and a third.
[2718.94 - 2719.94] P:921.18 E:0.102664 |  It's now full and three.
[2720.04 - 2721.84] P:1738.96 E:0.093140 |  Liverpool one no wonder. Arnie
[2721.94 - 2723.84] P:1460.19 E:0.095833 |  slot. The Liverpool manager has
[2723.94 - 2725.84] P:1554.71 E:0.100837 |  been talking about how the
[2725.84 - 2727.56] P:1812.13 E:0.099633 |  BBC Radio five live and they
[2727.66 - 2729.56] P:1824.90 E:0.103290 |  have been trying to secure it
[2729.66 - 2731.56] P:1624.32 E:0.093177 |  from their remaining eight
[2731.66 - 2732.76] P:1503.42 E:0.091061 |  games of which their trip to
[2732.86 - 2734.76] P:1570.89 E:0.091962 |  West London today is their
[2734.86 - 2736.76] P:1596.25 E:0.105302 |  eighth game to the end. And
[2736.86 - 2737.76] P:1125.63 E:0.110518 |  they've got the work cut out
[2737.86 - 2738.76] P:1568.53 E:0.107036 |  for them. As I say, you can
[2738.86 - 2740.76] P:1697.39 E:0.100240 |  hear it all on BBC Radio five
[2740.86 - 2742.76] P:1784.86 E:0.075004 |  live and then later on today at
[2742.86 - 2743.76] P:1605.85 E:0.096301 |  4 30. We take you to the
[2743.86 - 2745.76] P:1520.17 E:0.094782 |  Northwest. The Manchester
[2745.86 - 2747.76] P:1696.43 E:0.093744 |  Derby at Old Trafford. It's
[2747.86 - 2749.76] P:1789.30 E:0.096581 |  United against City John Murray
[2749.86 - 2750.76] P:1542.25 E:0.103003 |  and Leon Osmond there for that
[2750.86 - 2751.76] P:1582.33 E:0.063163 |  one. And I thoroughly look
[2751.86 - 2753.76] P:1883.25 E:0.108286 |  forward to watching match of the
[2753.78 - 2755.78] P:1510.70 E:0.098555 |  game. We're going to have a
[2755.88 - 2756.78] P:1856.21 E:0.095613 |  little bit of a break here.
[2756.88 - 2758.78] P:1591.59 E:0.087587 |  We have seen here this
[2758.88 - 2759.78] P:1834.13 E:0.097564 |  afternoon in North London just
[2759.88 - 2761.78] P:1623.32 E:0.081864 |  to reiterate then as we go into
[2761.88 - 2763.78] P:1314.79 E:0.033859 |  the final five minutes of the
[2763.88 - 2765.78] P:1525.82 E:0.064864 |  first half, it spurs one South
[2765.88 - 2768.78] P:1369.42 E:0.095289 |  Hampton. Yeah, it just see it.
[2768.88 - 2770.78] P:1072.85 E:0.111128 |  It's such a bug bear, isn't it?
[2770.88 - 2771.78] P:1321.57 E:0.049293 |  Every game we seem to have a
[2771.88 - 2773.78] P:1086.73 E:0.106589 |  conversation about how long it
[2773.88 - 2775.78] P:1099.62 E:0.103870 |  takes or why it takes along
[2775.88 - 2777.78] P:1413.17 E:0.106899 |  whereas it's I think it's very
[2777.88 - 2779.78] P:1361.35 E:0.103170 |  simple remedy. If it gets to a
[2779.88 - 2781.78] P:1493.95 E:0.094862 |  certain time, then the on feel
[2781.88 - 2782.78] P:1583.23 E:0.111684 |  if it's that unclear, then it's
[2782.80 - 2784.78] P:1665.36 E:0.072326 |  that clear. It's like a
[2784.88 - 2786.78] P:1533.02 E:0.090260 |  wide boy. You know, two fifths
[2786.88 - 2788.78] P:1524.47 E:0.093764 |  of a centimeter. Who knows? But
[2788.88 - 2790.78] P:1526.80 E:0.075152 |  it's crazy that's taken this
[2790.88 - 2793.78] P:1388.36 E:0.087034 |  long. The moon has. Come up
[2793.88 - 2795.78] P:1611.71 E:0.100689 |  more above the North London
[2795.88 - 2796.78] P:1874.08 E:0.083384 |  Stadium in the amount of time
[2796.88 - 2798.78] P:1243.40 E:0.090288 |  that it took for VAR to make
[2798.88 - 2800.78] P:1597.01 E:0.102607 |  their mind up over at Stockley
[2800.88 - 2802.78] P:1731.19 E:0.063455 |  Park. The VAR today's Graham
[2802.88 - 2804.78] P:1530.22 E:0.089966 |  Scott mentioned the man in the
[2804.88 - 2806.78] P:1498.13 E:0.093528 |  middle is Michael Salisbury
[2806.88 - 2809.78] P:1581.85 E:0.064800 |  assistant VAR Natalie Aspernell
[2809.88 - 2811.78] P:1457.80 E:0.108093 |  Spurs have the ball back to the
[2811.78 - 2813.78] P:1855.18 E:0.105711 |  left. He's got the ball down the
[2813.88 - 2815.78] P:1940.07 E:0.094022 |  right wing, right footed cross,
[2815.88 - 2817.78] P:1967.03 E:0.099360 |  headed up, but not away. Falls
[2817.88 - 2819.78] P:1845.64 E:0.114814 |  towards the edge of the box.
[2819.88 - 2820.78] P:1851.27 E:0.107681 |  Down goes Salanke. It drops
[2820.88 - 2823.78] P:1773.24 E:0.109146 |  instead towards Brennan Johnson
[2823.88 - 2825.78] P:1785.61 E:0.122333 |  who pokes it home, but
[2825.88 - 2827.78] P:1952.84 E:0.116220 |  immediately glances at the
[2827.88 - 2829.78] P:1859.09 E:0.104056 |  assistant referee who keeps his
[2829.88 - 2831.78] P:1938.43 E:0.118656 |  flag down and any celebrations
[2831.88 - 2833.78] P:1879.13 E:0.104139 |  are muted. And Shposter Coglou
[2833.88 - 2835.78] P:1665.79 E:0.117473 |  turned. Look to his coaching
[2835.88 - 2837.78] P:1775.72 E:0.108275 |  staff. He's smiling, but also
[2837.88 - 2839.78] P:1740.59 E:0.112288 |  purposefully not celebrating
[2839.78 - 2841.78] P:1869.80 E:0.108264 |  the victory. He's got the
[2841.88 - 2843.78] P:1809.78 E:0.107084 |  ball back to the left wing.
[2843.88 - 2845.78] P:1751.51 E:0.092786 |  And Spurs to Southampton Nill
[2845.88 - 2848.78] P:1636.12 E:0.111706 |  again. Stephen Kelly again. I
[2848.88 - 2849.78] P:1589.10 E:0.086284 |  was watching Johnson's run
[2849.88 - 2851.78] P:1490.17 E:0.106892 |  then Johnson's run looks like
[2851.88 - 2852.78] P:1306.46 E:0.102773 |  he's on side. He sneaks in
[2852.88 - 2854.78] P:1605.24 E:0.100595 |  refer the defending from South
[2854.88 - 2856.78] P:1464.23 E:0.112096 |  Hampton is abysmal. It's
[2856.88 - 2859.78] P:1643.48 E:0.101819 |  absolutely dreadful. They are
[2859.88 - 2861.78] P:1681.02 E:0.087478 |  so poor defensively. They switch
[2861.88 - 2862.78] P:1652.92 E:0.097688 |  off. They give fells away. They
[2862.88 - 2864.78] P:1598.01 E:0.121040 |  don't track their runners. The
[2864.88 - 2865.78] P:1722.94 E:0.057101 |  ball is bouncing around. First
[2865.88 - 2867.78] P:1736.97 E:0.118876 |  of all, it's Salanke gets his
[2867.88 - 2868.78] P:1704.28 E:0.110133 |  body in the way. Then Madison
[2868.78 - 2870.78] P:1875.62 E:0.086803 |  Johnson just kind of just creeps
[2870.88 - 2872.78] P:1731.54 E:0.111558 |  in between the defenders and
[2872.88 - 2874.78] P:1686.49 E:0.094855 |  taps it in. It's so easy. It is
[2874.88 - 2877.78] P:1509.27 E:0.097451 |  so easy for Tottenham. This one
[2877.88 - 2880.78] P:1620.22 E:0.092600 |  will stand. I get a great little
[2880.88 - 2882.78] P:1807.41 E:0.103544 |  finish. It's not just a little
[2882.88 - 2884.78] P:1710.69 E:0.094127 |  touches. It's so calm and
[2884.88 - 2886.78] P:1661.69 E:0.091000 |  collected from Johnson to get a
[2886.88 - 2888.78] P:1520.18 E:0.057012 |  second goal. And but honestly,
[2888.88 - 2890.78] P:1549.55 E:0.080146 |  I'm watching Southampton and
[2890.88 - 2893.78] P:1559.56 E:0.092409 |  they are devoid of any defensive
[2893.88 - 2895.78] P:1549.99 E:0.087532 |  solidness that you'd expect from
[2895.88 - 2896.78] P:1334.18 E:0.098192 |  any team in the Premier League.
[2896.78 - 2898.78] P:1676.90 E:0.090425 |  They are a team hurtling towards
[2898.88 - 2900.78] P:1789.43 E:0.094645 |  their second relegation in three
[2900.88 - 2903.78] P:1628.41 E:0.097709 |  seasons down as things stand. If
[2903.88 - 2905.78] P:1792.34 E:0.095097 |  they lose here today and they are
[2905.88 - 2907.78] P:1908.52 E:0.098517 |  doing in some style, they will be
[2907.88 - 2909.78] P:1430.45 E:0.111724 |  relegated. Two and a half minutes
[2909.88 - 2911.78] P:1700.02 E:0.103878 |  remain at the end of the first
[2911.88 - 2913.78] P:1885.63 E:0.102946 |  half. It is now spurs to South
[2913.88 - 2914.78] P:1482.68 E:0.100174 |  Hampton, Neil, and we can say
[2914.88 - 2916.78] P:1715.73 E:0.091742 |  that with certainty. And as I
[2916.88 - 2918.78] P:1703.70 E:0.087373 |  glance down to my left hand side,
[2918.88 - 2919.78] P:1906.12 E:0.102715 |  which is where you'll find the
[2919.88 - 2920.78] P:1514.76 E:0.090845 |  traveling Southampton supporters,
[2920.88 - 2922.78] P:1877.65 E:0.095286 |  many of them are shielding their
[2922.88 - 2924.78] P:1768.15 E:0.092429 |  eyes, not just because the sun is
[2924.78 - 2926.78] P:1565.58 E:0.093616 |  in their vision today, but also
[2926.88 - 2927.78] P:1775.22 E:0.083818 |  because the football that they are
[2927.88 - 2929.78] P:1489.35 E:0.088888 |  having to be subjected to again
[2929.88 - 2932.78] P:1738.60 E:0.092231 |  this season is worthy of covering
[2932.88 - 2934.78] P:1481.45 E:0.043903 |  your eyes for. Yeah, you feel
[2934.88 - 2935.78] P:1414.44 E:0.084802 |  sorry for them. Listen, they've come
[2935.88 - 2937.78] P:1284.53 E:0.099737 |  out in the numbers again. They've
[2937.88 - 2938.78] P:829.89 E:0.102793 |  probably wanted to come to this.
[2938.88 - 2940.78] P:1579.94 E:0.097991 |  There's wonderful arena, which,
[2940.88 - 2942.78] P:1855.82 E:0.090059 |  you know, at times can produce
[2942.88 - 2944.78] P:1508.76 E:0.091349 |  moments of wonderful games because
[2944.88 - 2946.78] P:1285.53 E:0.103979 |  they taught them play because they're
[2946.88 - 2948.78] P:1831.27 E:0.067625 |  open and it's an experience to come
[2948.88 - 2950.78] P:1459.58 E:0.062437 |  to this stadium. But you're not
[2950.88 - 2951.78] P:1535.10 E:0.088742 |  coming for the experience of
[2951.88 - 2953.78] P:1629.05 E:0.086662 |  watching their team because they
[2953.78 - 2954.78] P:1366.48 E:0.086334 |  don't give them anything at the
[2954.88 - 2955.78] P:1175.30 E:0.098038 |  moment. They don't give them
[2955.88 - 2959.78] P:1652.10 E:0.041021 |  anything to celebrate. Well, spurs
[2959.88 - 2960.78] P:1496.28 E:0.083104 |  have the ball at the back with
[2960.88 - 2965.78] P:1698.38 E:0.034082 |  the cario. As we approach the
[2965.88 - 2967.78] P:1871.18 E:0.088947 |  44th minute here in North London,
[2967.88 - 2970.78] P:1843.92 E:0.089928 |  Sunkins continues to shine as
[2970.88 - 2972.78] P:1841.40 E:0.093731 |  Davis plays a long searching ball
[2972.88 - 2974.78] P:1885.89 E:0.091121 |  down that far left touch line in
[2974.88 - 2976.78] P:1824.11 E:0.094386 |  the direction of Jed spent spurs
[2976.88 - 2978.78] P:1840.06 E:0.110216 |  leading by two goals to nil
[2978.88 - 2979.78] P:1253.47 E:0.110148 |  Fulham still leading against
[2979.88 - 2981.78] P:1795.00 E:0.087321 |  Liverpool by three goals to one
[2981.78 - 2983.78] P:1922.17 E:0.091199 |  and it remains goalless at
[2983.88 - 2986.78] P:1448.20 E:0.050197 |  Brentford as they welcome
[2986.88 - 2987.78] P:1805.53 E:0.093214 |  Chelsea this afternoon. Ramsdale
[2987.88 - 2989.78] P:1497.50 E:0.110743 |  caught near his goal line ball
[2989.88 - 2991.78] P:1248.48 E:0.076436 |  back to him that he didn't want.
[2991.88 - 2993.78] P:1373.90 E:0.083297 |  Now it's with Manning Southampton
[2993.88 - 2995.78] P:1770.51 E:0.114954 |  shuffle the ball forwards down the
[2995.88 - 2997.78] P:1687.83 E:0.106420 |  left touch line. Romero gets caught
[2997.88 - 2999.78] P:1760.10 E:0.106864 |  by Cameldean Sulamana, but
[2999.88 - 3001.78] P:1884.81 E:0.093726 |  Cross comes bent and cur and sweeps
[3001.88 - 3003.78] P:1912.44 E:0.105775 |  up in behind with a strong sliding
[3003.88 - 3005.78] P:1448.83 E:0.090405 |  tackle and Ramsdale has it back
[3005.88 - 3007.78] P:1428.50 E:0.111749 |  once more inside his penalty area.
[3007.88 - 3008.78] P:1893.94 E:0.129306 |  He shows composure. He's got the
[3008.88 - 3010.78] P:1810.63 E:0.085081 |  wall of Tottenham fans behind
[3010.78 - 3012.78] P:1649.36 E:0.085832 |  him and they're taking great joy
[3012.88 - 3014.78] P:1728.65 E:0.083140 |  in teasing him. But to be fair
[3014.88 - 3016.78] P:1875.49 E:0.103226 |  to Aaron Ramsdale who's conceded
[3016.88 - 3017.78] P:1648.84 E:0.099726 |  two goals could have been three
[3017.88 - 3019.78] P:1753.85 E:0.087371 |  goals if it weren't for the VAR.
[3019.88 - 3021.78] P:1862.38 E:0.087018 |  It would have been a huge amount
[3021.88 - 3023.78] P:1631.70 E:0.108829 |  worse if it weren't for the former
[3023.88 - 3024.78] P:1688.04 E:0.105736 |  Arsenal keeper. The pass he's just
[3024.88 - 3025.78] P:1302.30 E:0.113442 |  made the title of the league all of
[3025.88 - 3027.78] P:1325.98 E:0.105722 |  what seven yards is probably the
[3027.88 - 3028.78] P:1381.25 E:0.098135 |  best pass to set Hampton players
[3028.88 - 3030.78] P:1796.97 E:0.107416 |  made the whole game. He's fired a
[3030.88 - 3031.78] P:569.52 E:0.114027 |  true loads of bodies low trajectory
[3031.88 - 3034.78] P:1819.78 E:0.073123 |  straight to his feet and Dibbling
[3034.88 - 3035.78] P:1737.47 E:0.116837 |  was shown for in a really good
[3035.88 - 3036.78] P:1661.91 E:0.083093 |  position and gets them up the
[3036.88 - 3038.78] P:1677.55 E:0.062087 |  pitch. They show good fight
[3038.88 - 3039.78] P:1838.15 E:0.067442 |  against Crystal Palace the other
[3039.78 - 3041.78] P:1657.79 E:0.106287 |  day as Sulamana steps between a
[3041.88 - 3043.78] P:1744.18 E:0.088772 |  couple of spurs players and throws
[3043.88 - 3045.78] P:1494.00 E:0.116253 |  himself into the penalty area goes
[3045.88 - 3047.78] P:1611.64 E:0.113124 |  to ground and no real look in the
[3047.88 - 3049.78] P:1705.71 E:0.102489 |  direction of the referee at the
[3049.88 - 3051.78] P:1616.74 E:0.060644 |  moment. But certainly seem to hurt
[3051.88 - 3053.78] P:1318.44 E:0.097432 |  his knee as he did hit the deck. He
[3053.88 - 3055.78] P:1543.93 E:0.096611 |  now slowly gets back up again as we
[3055.88 - 3057.78] P:1603.75 E:0.112580 |  see just the seven minutes added on
[3057.88 - 3059.78] P:1830.49 E:0.098216 |  at the end of the first half.
[3059.88 - 3061.78] P:1787.13 E:0.089263 |  Steven Kelly I wonder why we've got
[3061.88 - 3063.78] P:1458.60 E:0.082135 |  so much madness isn't it? Absolutely
[3063.88 - 3064.78] P:1101.61 E:0.109093 |  madness that the players are
[3064.88 - 3065.78] P:1163.10 E:0.093727 |  standing around for seven minutes
[3065.88 - 3067.78] P:1459.04 E:0.083098 |  during a game. Six minutes in the
[3067.78 - 3069.78] P:1706.33 E:0.065562 |  first half. Yeah Sulamana left side
[3069.88 - 3071.78] P:1632.80 E:0.118084 |  of the spurs penalty area dressed in
[3071.88 - 3073.78] P:1746.97 E:0.093292 |  pink. He gives it to Manning who
[3073.88 - 3075.78] P:1666.06 E:0.101223 |  offers the overlap lifts it into the
[3075.88 - 3077.78] P:1807.87 E:0.095272 |  six yard box and it lands delicately
[3077.88 - 3081.78] P:1728.11 E:0.084477 |  into the gloves of Vicario in the
[3081.88 - 3084.78] P:1665.90 E:0.076599 |  spurs goal and so far so good for
[3084.88 - 3086.78] P:1636.19 E:0.096349 |  Ranch Poster Cogluy needed an
[3086.88 - 3087.78] P:908.13 E:0.124262 |  afternoon where they looked good in
[3087.88 - 3089.78] P:1258.59 E:0.110486 |  the sun and they are doing so far
[3089.88 - 3091.78] P:1773.67 E:0.067570 |  albeit against the South Hampton side
[3091.88 - 3094.78] P:1573.32 E:0.053547 |  that are so so poor. Yeah they haven't
[3094.88 - 3095.78] P:1204.08 E:0.110281 |  put a much of a fight. They just
[3095.78 - 3097.78] P:1691.61 E:0.076767 |  Madison gets pickpocketed here just
[3097.88 - 3099.78] P:1597.79 E:0.111386 |  in the edge of the box. First time
[3099.88 - 3101.78] P:1580.25 E:0.102491 |  he's come really deep to receive it
[3101.88 - 3103.78] P:1325.35 E:0.083160 |  and this time not aware of who's
[3103.88 - 3105.78] P:1663.51 E:0.058359 |  behind them, but I think what I'd
[3105.88 - 3107.78] P:1783.60 E:0.089685 |  like to see from spurs now is to
[3107.88 - 3109.78] P:1325.11 E:0.097969 |  keep it up. Don't let off. Don't let
[3109.88 - 3111.78] P:1657.83 E:0.063848 |  them come back into it. I'm really
[3111.88 - 3113.78] P:1565.18 E:0.083691 |  trying to hone themselves and for
[3113.88 - 3115.78] P:1673.45 E:0.073427 |  South Hampton, do they have a fight?
[3115.88 - 3117.78] P:1974.47 E:0.104582 |  Can they show something about
[3117.88 - 3119.78] P:1551.87 E:0.076500 |  themselves that they're, listen,
[3119.88 - 3121.78] P:1528.77 E:0.068729 |  they're down, they're relegated.
[3121.88 - 3123.78] P:1622.06 E:0.106342 |  But what can you do? What can you
[3123.88 - 3124.78] P:1989.98 E:0.124823 |  prove as a player to show you have
[3124.78 - 3125.78] P:1433.94 E:0.100887 |  more about you than what you've
[3125.88 - 3126.78] P:1449.81 E:0.094142 |  shown so far in the season?
[3126.88 - 3128.78] P:1407.83 E:0.066868 |  Dibbling has the ball for South
[3128.88 - 3130.78] P:1782.40 E:0.081344 |  Hampton, square across the middle of
[3130.88 - 3132.78] P:1710.04 E:0.097564 |  the midfield inside the spurs half
[3132.88 - 3134.78] P:1758.73 E:0.085728 |  for a Rebo and now out to Sulamana
[3134.88 - 3136.78] P:1615.14 E:0.098182 |  on the left wing in one of the only
[3136.88 - 3138.78] P:1606.55 E:0.091884 |  shaded areas of this half on this
[3138.88 - 3140.78] P:1756.43 E:0.074367 |  near touch line as South Hampton
[3140.88 - 3142.78] P:1529.24 E:0.082865 |  continue to kick from right to left
[3142.88 - 3144.78] P:1912.71 E:0.084975 |  inside first half stoppage time,
[3144.88 - 3146.78] P:1514.94 E:0.095708 |  seven minutes of it. We played just
[3146.88 - 3148.78] P:1804.04 E:0.070086 |  over 90 seconds of that at the
[3148.88 - 3150.78] P:1410.45 E:0.107912 |  moment as Walker Peters picks it up
[3150.88 - 3152.78] P:1616.14 E:0.096475 |  once more on the right wing bathed
[3152.88 - 3153.78] P:1677.55 E:0.098870 |  in sunshine on that far side, which
[3153.78 - 3154.78] P:1586.24 E:0.121269 |  is where all of the South Hampton
[3154.88 - 3156.78] P:1593.30 E:0.089078 |  supporters are gathered. Ball into
[3156.88 - 3158.78] P:1458.64 E:0.094758 |  the penalty area comes off Madison
[3158.88 - 3159.78] P:1673.29 E:0.089118 |  back to Dibbling forced outside of
[3159.88 - 3162.78] P:1817.95 E:0.094298 |  the 18 yard box with a Rebo 20 yards
[3162.88 - 3164.78] P:1424.58 E:0.100066 |  away now from the penalty area to
[3164.88 - 3166.78] P:1700.39 E:0.092783 |  Manning and now down the left wing
[3166.88 - 3168.78] P:1706.83 E:0.109163 |  for Sulamana onto his right foot
[3168.88 - 3170.78] P:1797.09 E:0.072834 |  curling ball towards the back post
[3170.88 - 3171.78] P:1844.65 E:0.119523 |  about three or four yards in front
[3171.88 - 3173.78] P:1692.49 E:0.100000 |  of the sliding Tyler Dibbling who
[3173.88 - 3175.78] P:1900.27 E:0.098843 |  was trying to keep it in trying to
[3175.88 - 3176.78] P:1481.81 E:0.093725 |  turn it go woods but was never
[3176.88 - 3177.78] P:1397.24 E:0.085907 |  going to get there and it's a
[3177.88 - 3178.78] P:1511.42 E:0.053667 |  goal kick instead.
[3178.88 - 3180.78] P:1373.27 E:0.096875 |  It's a decent ball from Sulamana.
[3180.88 - 3182.78] P:1765.59 E:0.082206 |  It just drops the shoulders, come
[3182.78 - 3183.78] P:1943.90 E:0.081121 |  on, it's a good ball from the
[3183.88 - 3185.78] P:1781.37 E:0.067083 |  left side and just float one into
[3185.88 - 3187.78] P:1747.24 E:0.089500 |  the far post. Vicario can come
[3187.88 - 3188.78] P:1761.12 E:0.082892 |  for it because the pace on the
[3188.88 - 3191.78] P:1726.83 E:0.075011 |  ball but Dibbling gets caught
[3191.88 - 3192.78] P:1585.22 E:0.111100 |  edge of the box and he can't
[3192.88 - 3193.78] P:1501.90 E:0.083430 |  really get himself around to try
[3193.88 - 3195.78] P:1548.61 E:0.037898 |  and make contact with it.
[3195.88 - 3197.78] P:1752.63 E:0.109113 |  Just watching some images flashing
[3197.88 - 3199.78] P:1593.19 E:0.097097 |  up of Angi Poster Cogglio on the
[3199.88 - 3200.78] P:1267.14 E:0.110907 |  monitors here in the press box
[3200.88 - 3202.78] P:1624.70 E:0.096288 |  where he's doing that rock paper
[3202.88 - 3203.78] P:1287.87 E:0.120564 |  scissors, which he felt was
[3203.88 - 3205.78] P:1788.92 E:0.092047 |  probably the way that the AR
[3205.88 - 3206.78] P:1897.71 E:0.073549 |  decided that their second goal,
[3206.88 - 3208.78] P:1917.07 E:0.089935 |  which didn't count, was to be
[3208.88 - 3210.78] P:2037.03 E:0.087470 |  ruled out for offside and he was
[3210.88 - 3211.78] P:1610.25 E:0.116990 |  showing images of how he was
[3211.78 - 3212.78] P:1989.41 E:0.069126 |  playing the ball and the image
[3212.88 - 3214.78] P:1726.72 E:0.100413 |  of the offside call and how tight
[3214.88 - 3216.78] P:1604.91 E:0.100109 |  it was and how it was ruled out
[3216.88 - 3218.78] P:1964.32 E:0.100007 |  for a hand of Davis and a shoulder
[3218.88 - 3220.78] P:1823.04 E:0.089355 |  of Romero. Here comes Spurs
[3220.88 - 3222.78] P:1657.95 E:0.103118 |  again. Son Heung-Min left side of
[3222.88 - 3223.78] P:1026.25 E:0.114778 |  the penalty area near the corner
[3223.88 - 3225.78] P:1945.82 E:0.079826 |  of it goes to find Spence who
[3225.88 - 3227.78] P:1585.85 E:0.093290 |  might well be offside. He is,
[3227.88 - 3228.78] P:1618.43 E:0.082424 |  it'll be a free kick for South
[3228.88 - 3229.78] P:2053.58 E:0.107490 |  Hampton should they choose to
[3229.88 - 3230.78] P:1509.21 E:0.106550 |  take it but the referee instead
[3230.88 - 3232.78] P:1375.43 E:0.100549 |  will play an advantage as they
[3232.88 - 3233.78] P:1584.64 E:0.082352 |  play their way out. It's
[3233.88 - 3234.78] P:1751.15 E:0.078116 |  Mattias Fernandez dead center of
[3234.88 - 3236.78] P:1715.24 E:0.089640 |  the Saints half. Three minutes
[3236.88 - 3237.78] P:1213.30 E:0.100131 |  of seven added on have been
[3237.88 - 3239.78] P:1762.44 E:0.073588 |  played. Spurs still leading by
[3239.88 - 3240.78] P:1845.22 E:0.086570 |  two goals to nil approaching
[3240.78 - 3241.78] P:1732.88 E:0.081898 |  half time at Craven Cottage.
[3241.88 - 3243.78] P:1789.79 E:0.090380 |  It's fallen three Liverpool one
[3243.88 - 3245.78] P:1560.82 E:0.080077 |  and nil nil between Brentford
[3245.88 - 3247.78] P:1767.23 E:0.071647 |  and Chelsea. That one available
[3247.88 - 3248.78] P:1425.39 E:0.104038 |  to listen to on the BBC Sport
[3248.88 - 3250.78] P:1888.05 E:0.096483 |  website. The action from Craven
[3250.88 - 3253.78] P:1698.38 E:0.085529 |  Cottage is on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3253.88 - 3254.78] P:1058.03 E:0.103214 |  Dibbling has it inside the center
[3254.88 - 3256.78] P:1490.73 E:0.082656 |  circle. Nothing else. He is
[3256.88 - 3258.78] P:1756.37 E:0.062195 |  playing to get a move, I would
[3258.88 - 3260.78] P:1660.27 E:0.071001 |  think, in the remaining seven
[3260.88 - 3262.78] P:1737.69 E:0.091555 |  games after today for South
[3262.88 - 3263.78] P:1802.30 E:0.064074 |  Hampton. Possibly to here, he's
[3263.88 - 3265.78] P:1606.04 E:0.108639 |  been linked with here, possibly
[3265.88 - 3267.78] P:1810.82 E:0.091765 |  to Manchester City as well as
[3267.88 - 3269.78] P:1631.14 E:0.095976 |  Spurs recover possession through
[3269.78 - 3270.78] P:1385.96 E:0.064777 |  the game. He's been playing
[3270.88 - 3271.78] P:1710.50 E:0.075239 |  the game for the past five
[3271.88 - 3272.78] P:1785.33 E:0.113659 |  years. He's been playing the
[3272.88 - 3273.78] P:1613.97 E:0.103339 |  same game as he did in the
[3273.88 - 3275.78] P:1366.06 E:0.115790 |  last game against the
[3275.88 - 3276.78] P:1649.06 E:0.097040 |  Peadro Porro. It does kind of
[3276.88 - 3277.78] P:1798.96 E:0.052776 |  remind me of Jack Greenish
[3277.88 - 3278.78] P:1307.73 E:0.116795 |  actually how he plays not just
[3278.88 - 3279.78] P:1582.01 E:0.103095 |  the low socks. That's not just
[3279.88 - 3280.78] P:1987.23 E:0.062462 |  the low socks. It just his
[3280.88 - 3282.78] P:1501.45 E:0.101190 |  movement. It comes off the line.
[3282.88 - 3283.78] P:1520.65 E:0.074875 |  He draws players in kind of
[3283.88 - 3284.78] P:1156.40 E:0.111399 |  sucks you in the feel like you
[3284.88 - 3286.78] P:1806.38 E:0.078966 |  can get a touch on it, but then
[3286.88 - 3287.78] P:1699.55 E:0.065641 |  manipulates the ball to get away
[3287.88 - 3289.78] P:1645.97 E:0.077720 |  from you. But as such as have
[3289.88 - 3290.78] P:1591.81 E:0.076980 |  been fewer far between this
[3290.88 - 3291.78] P:1610.37 E:0.098213 |  afternoon because they just
[3291.88 - 3293.78] P:1683.65 E:0.086629 |  haven't had any possession. Well,
[3293.88 - 3294.78] P:1007.88 E:0.090959 |  you mentioned and I thought it
[3294.88 - 3296.78] P:1737.93 E:0.086229 |  before you said it. Aaron Ramstell's
[3296.88 - 3298.78] P:1439.95 E:0.095560 |  ball out about five minutes ago
[3298.78 - 3300.78] P:1517.69 E:0.077580 |  and he's the goalkeeper. He's
[3300.88 - 3302.78] P:1642.11 E:0.083094 |  the goalkeeper and you know, he
[3302.88 - 3303.78] P:1919.30 E:0.095503 |  wasn't trying to play it square.
[3303.88 - 3304.78] P:1894.34 E:0.108084 |  I played short. He played it,
[3304.88 - 3306.78] P:1673.39 E:0.080351 |  you know, from inside his box
[3306.88 - 3308.78] P:1557.02 E:0.099385 |  who are 10 15 yards inside to
[3308.88 - 3309.78] P:1232.16 E:0.092107 |  talk them half of the pitch.
[3309.88 - 3310.78] P:1711.13 E:0.076240 |  Dibbling was in a great position.
[3310.88 - 3311.78] P:1372.07 E:0.101841 |  That was a great pass from
[3311.88 - 3312.78] P:1182.14 E:0.107568 |  Howard Bellister. Far better.
[3312.88 - 3314.78] P:1651.87 E:0.108499 |  Maybe we've taught them into it.
[3314.88 - 3315.78] P:1667.00 E:0.110197 |  Mattias Fernandez now dinks a
[3315.88 - 3317.78] P:1515.24 E:0.105988 |  delightful ball out in the
[3317.88 - 3318.78] P:1811.10 E:0.095819 |  direction of Dibbling on the
[3318.88 - 3319.78] P:1865.99 E:0.092381 |  right wing controls it with his
[3319.88 - 3320.78] P:2079.74 E:0.100546 |  chest. He's fronted off
[3320.88 - 3322.78] P:1779.50 E:0.096507 |  immediately by Spence and Son
[3322.88 - 3324.78] P:1601.43 E:0.091063 |  and looks like an island until
[3324.88 - 3326.78] P:1797.49 E:0.081014 |  he finds Walker Peters back to
[3326.78 - 3328.78] P:1644.91 E:0.092061 |  a Rebo 25 yards out from goal.
[3328.88 - 3330.78] P:1603.83 E:0.097374 |  Mattias Fernandez opens up for
[3330.88 - 3331.78] P:1462.00 E:0.114441 |  him. Nobody's closing him down
[3331.88 - 3332.78] P:1666.85 E:0.100846 |  and so it is right foot. He
[3332.88 - 3334.78] P:1829.18 E:0.089603 |  hits it from around 23 yards,
[3334.88 - 3335.78] P:1717.81 E:0.089942 |  but it bubbles in the direction
[3335.88 - 3337.78] P:1560.85 E:0.106510 |  of the cario who makes a very
[3337.88 - 3339.78] P:1495.02 E:0.082597 |  comfortable save. Yeah, very

[3341.88 - 3343.78] P:1622.62 E:0.088228 |  a decent clean contact on a bit
[3343.88 - 3344.78] P:1284.44 E:0.102526 |  of bouncing from the vicario.
[3344.88 - 3346.78] P:1661.25 E:0.081786 |  Dibbling was in a really good
[3346.88 - 3347.78] P:1990.48 E:0.111383 |  position on the edge of the
[3347.88 - 3349.78] P:1850.70 E:0.088395 |  box. Spencer's dropped inside
[3349.88 - 3351.78] P:1713.15 E:0.089061 |  and kind of got drawn towards
[3351.88 - 3352.78] P:1007.24 E:0.101896 |  the ball and Dibbling had just
[3352.88 - 3354.78] P:1976.08 E:0.095803 |  pulled off a shoulder. We had a
[3354.88 - 3355.78] P:1551.42 E:0.107961 |  release them there. He was
[3355.78 - 3357.78] P:1800.78 E:0.074295 |  taking them on behind Spence
[3357.88 - 3358.78] P:1851.12 E:0.073935 |  driving towards the Tottenham
[3358.88 - 3359.78] P:1293.92 E:0.096486 |  goal and that would have been
[3359.88 - 3360.78] P:801.62 E:0.088159 |  a really good position for
[3360.88 - 3362.78] P:1396.27 E:0.073402 |  Seth Hampton to be in. Spurs
[3362.88 - 3363.78] P:1677.11 E:0.042136 |  have it again looking for a
[3363.88 - 3364.78] P:1336.30 E:0.103152 |  counter attack down the left,
[3364.88 - 3365.78] P:1619.57 E:0.105344 |  which is where they got their
[3365.88 - 3367.78] P:1892.13 E:0.094666 |  first goal from two goals have
[3367.88 - 3369.78] P:1826.68 E:0.078435 |  been scored both by Brennan
[3369.88 - 3371.78] P:1506.78 E:0.066699 |  Johnson. Bergvall also thought
[3371.88 - 3372.78] P:1613.33 E:0.079385 |  he'd scored, but that was
[3372.88 - 3374.78] P:1079.41 E:0.091030 |  disallowed by VAR of which we've
[3374.88 - 3376.78] P:1835.60 E:0.089283 |  labored plenty over Johnson
[3376.88 - 3378.78] P:1652.70 E:0.072057 |  attempts to find Bergvall with
[3378.88 - 3380.78] P:1668.80 E:0.086777 |  a lofted ball down the Spurs
[3380.88 - 3382.78] P:1742.73 E:0.096239 |  right as Son Joong Min goes
[3382.88 - 3383.78] P:1662.14 E:0.084289 |  down under the challenge of
[3383.88 - 3384.78] P:1561.25 E:0.104901 |  Manning and Manning throws
[3384.78 - 3386.78] P:1768.47 E:0.091193 |  himself to the floor under the
[3386.88 - 3388.78] P:1791.36 E:0.109926 |  slightest touch from Johnson and
[3388.88 - 3390.78] P:1591.67 E:0.076121 |  that'll be a free kick for
[3390.88 - 3391.78] P:1397.09 E:0.106152 |  Southampton. Even Eurich
[3391.88 - 3393.78] P:2139.33 E:0.098298 |  challenged his players before
[3393.88 - 3395.78] P:1745.95 E:0.079550 |  this game to avoid being the
[3395.88 - 3397.78] P:1719.67 E:0.086734 |  worst Premier League team ever.
[3397.88 - 3398.78] P:1567.97 E:0.085291 |  They have 10 points at the
[3398.88 - 3402.78] P:1656.31 E:0.069719 |  moment. 11 is the mark from
[3402.88 - 3404.78] P:1522.61 E:0.066692 |  Derby County coming on for 20
[3404.88 - 3405.78] P:1258.43 E:0.114305 |  years ago now. Paul Jules said
[3405.88 - 3406.78] P:1824.78 E:0.107284 |  that's something that he was
[3406.88 - 3407.78] P:1264.96 E:0.076671 |  the manager at the time, still
[3407.88 - 3409.78] P:1742.84 E:0.099542 |  follows him around to this day.
[3409.88 - 3410.78] P:1748.93 E:0.051796 |  Derby fans in the East
[3410.88 - 3412.78] P:1491.55 E:0.073370 |  Midlands will certainly not be
[3412.88 - 3413.78] P:1647.44 E:0.086618 |  cheering for Southampton
[3413.78 - 3414.78] P:1270.32 E:0.098566 |  because it's a moniker that
[3414.88 - 3415.78] P:1223.06 E:0.089035 |  they're desperate to share as
[3415.88 - 3417.78] P:1878.51 E:0.090437 |  well, but it comes to something,
[3417.88 - 3418.78] P:1182.30 E:0.118102 |  doesn't it? When a manager is
[3418.88 - 3420.78] P:1897.26 E:0.088739 |  saying, just try to avoid being
[3420.88 - 3421.78] P:1317.43 E:0.103489 |  the worst team ever.
[3421.88 - 3422.78] P:1571.62 E:0.094284 |  You're clutching us straws,
[3422.88 - 3423.78] P:1624.92 E:0.111307 |  aren't you? That's the team
[3423.88 - 3424.78] P:1584.89 E:0.083934 |  that's trying to motivate you.
[3424.88 - 3426.78] P:1258.53 E:0.113300 |  I played against at Derby side
[3426.88 - 3428.78] P:1509.03 E:0.080817 |  and they were poor. They were
[3428.88 - 3430.78] P:1648.17 E:0.061331 |  really poor side, but is it
[3430.88 - 3432.78] P:1606.50 E:0.091455 |  worse the points or getting
[3432.88 - 3433.78] P:1170.11 E:0.102123 |  relegated earlier in the season?
[3433.88 - 3435.78] P:1118.00 E:0.079229 |  I'm not, this is the pointing
[3435.88 - 3436.78] P:1379.93 E:0.122156 |  stand. Spencer's robbed,
[3436.88 - 3438.78] P:1641.27 E:0.104904 |  dibbling on the edge of his
[3438.88 - 3439.78] P:1633.31 E:0.128380 |  own penalty area, right footed
[3439.88 - 3441.78] P:1784.62 E:0.106139 |  shot, beaten away by Aaron
[3441.78 - 3443.78] P:1880.15 E:0.107535 |  Ramstale, only as far as
[3443.88 - 3445.78] P:1685.63 E:0.105227 |  Bergwald, Porro and he can try
[3445.88 - 3447.78] P:1866.42 E:0.099694 |  to concede possession and then
[3447.88 - 3448.78] P:1679.93 E:0.115199 |  look to win it back, but in
[3448.88 - 3450.78] P:1571.59 E:0.095049 |  doing so give Southampton a
[3450.88 - 3451.78] P:1670.83 E:0.095507 |  free kick on this near touchline
[3451.88 - 3452.78] P:1631.89 E:0.105803 |  20 yards inside of their own
[3452.88 - 3454.78] P:1146.29 E:0.115155 |  heart. No, Ram's that's it.
[3454.88 - 3455.78] P:1453.72 E:0.117863 |  That's a wonderful save.
[3455.88 - 3457.78] P:1661.21 E:0.101846 |  Spence gets in behind the fall
[3457.88 - 3459.78] P:1650.09 E:0.098216 |  back, takes it, opens his body,
[3459.88 - 3460.78] P:1514.04 E:0.098991 |  you have closer whipping in that
[3460.88 - 3461.78] P:1410.30 E:0.101403 |  far corner and Ram's that a full
[3461.88 - 3463.78] P:1742.06 E:0.102614 |  stretch left hand palms in a way
[3463.88 - 3465.78] P:1447.65 E:0.093073 |  and a tartot number definitely
[3465.88 - 3467.78] P:1593.12 E:0.075489 |  going to get us heard.
[3467.88 - 3468.78] P:1723.46 E:0.087699 |  Brennan Johnson has two goals.
[3468.88 - 3470.78] P:1663.20 E:0.100117 |  Southampton are two nil down.
[3470.78 - 3472.78] P:1628.27 E:0.076914 |  And we are approaching the end
[3472.88 - 3474.78] P:1929.54 E:0.098149 |  of the seven additional minutes
[3474.88 - 3475.78] P:1824.04 E:0.087700 |  and there they go.
[3475.88 - 3477.78] P:1818.60 E:0.085738 |  The referee blows for half time.
[3477.88 - 3479.78] P:1714.64 E:0.105386 |  All applause here at the Tottenham
[3479.88 - 3481.78] P:1772.42 E:0.107029 |  Hotspur Stadium and despite the
[3481.88 - 3483.78] P:1529.92 E:0.101078 |  fact that Tottenham lead by two
[3483.88 - 3484.78] P:2000.84 E:0.104814 |  goals to nail and both of them
[3484.88 - 3485.78] P:1346.20 E:0.099334 |  have been scored by Brennan
[3485.88 - 3487.78] P:1631.59 E:0.095908 |  Johnson. I think Stephen Kelly,
[3487.88 - 3488.78] P:1561.89 E:0.080193 |  you could make a very good claim
[3488.88 - 3490.78] P:1636.08 E:0.075854 |  for saying that Aaron Ramstale
[3490.88 - 3491.78] P:1266.55 E:0.113569 |  might be the man of the match
[3491.88 - 3493.78] P:1450.03 E:0.096765 |  so far. Oh, he is. Yeah, best
[3493.88 - 3494.78] P:1570.81 E:0.082336 |  pass to the match. Two great
[3494.88 - 3496.78] P:1490.92 E:0.094180 |  saves. Toured one just there by
[3496.88 - 3498.78] P:1501.27 E:0.092278 |  Spence. He's kept Southampton
[3498.78 - 3500.78] P:1178.19 E:0.068795 |  in it, but they're going to lose
[3500.88 - 3501.78] P:1248.55 E:0.103518 |  but it looks like they're going to
[3501.88 - 3502.78] P:1038.21 E:0.119382 |  lose this match. They're going to
[3502.88 - 3504.78] P:1718.10 E:0.105059 |  have to put in a huge performance
[3504.88 - 3506.78] P:1436.27 E:0.105044 |  the second half to try and get back
[3506.88 - 3508.78] P:1210.32 E:0.097880 |  into it. And Ram's there as as
[3508.88 - 3509.78] P:1133.41 E:0.085736 |  don't want what's been asked from
[3509.88 - 3510.78] P:1597.38 E:0.103970 |  me. Couldn't have done anything
[3510.88 - 3511.78] P:1125.93 E:0.111570 |  with the first with the two
[3511.88 - 3513.78] P:1332.70 E:0.096499 |  goals and when the moments of
[3513.88 - 3515.78] P:1254.82 E:0.082731 |  Comey's made some big saves as
[3515.88 - 3517.78] P:1610.43 E:0.105019 |  things stand, Southampton will be
[3517.88 - 3520.78] P:1515.97 E:0.102140 |  relegated this afternoon. They will
[3520.88 - 3522.78] P:1626.89 E:0.112631 |  be if they lose. They are two nil
[3522.88 - 3524.78] P:1750.08 E:0.101992 |  down. They have another 45 minutes
[3524.88 - 3526.78] P:1630.18 E:0.113990 |  to ensure that they don't set a new
[3526.88 - 3527.78] P:1836.57 E:0.087411 |  record for the fastest relegation
[3527.78 - 3529.78] P:1734.90 E:0.108312 |  in Premier League history. Spurs
[3529.88 - 3531.78] P:1908.25 E:0.095815 |  leading by two goals to nil here,
[3531.88 - 3533.78] P:1831.47 E:0.094446 |  full and leading by three goals to
[3533.88 - 3535.78] P:1897.84 E:0.099477 |  one at Craven Cottage against
[3535.88 - 3536.78] P:1172.79 E:0.101840 |  Liverpool at halftime. It's
[3536.88 - 3538.78] P:1857.61 E:0.090523 |  goalless between Brentford and
[3538.88 - 3539.78] P:1836.36 E:0.088393 |  Chelsea. We will be back for
[3539.88 - 3541.78] P:1628.66 E:0.104319 |  second half commentary shortly
[3541.88 - 3543.78] P:1770.98 E:0.103034 |  here on five sports extra, but
[3543.88 - 3544.78] P:1754.90 E:0.110763 |  during halftime we can get news
[3544.88 - 3546.78] P:1762.81 E:0.111771 |  from the rest of the day's action
[3546.88 - 3549.78] P:1144.27 E:0.092622 |  with five loss against the country.
[3549.88 - 3551.78] P:1999.15 E:0.095289 |  Police in Lincolnshire have named
[3551.88 - 3552.78] P:1118.39 E:0.093370 |  a father and daughter who were
[3552.88 - 3554.78] P:1566.95 E:0.096371 |  killed in a fire at a caravan park
[3554.88 - 3556.78] P:1821.45 E:0.090446 |  in Englebone, 48 year old Lee
[3556.78 - 3557.78] P:1568.55 E:0.086451 |  Baker and his 10 year old daughter
[3557.88 - 3559.78] P:1297.75 E:0.112701 |  Esmeia from the Nottingham area.
[3559.88 - 3561.78] P:2019.87 E:0.084927 |  Two 16 year old boys have been
[3561.88 - 3562.78] P:1414.85 E:0.073169 |  arrested on suspicion of murder
[3562.88 - 3564.78] P:1656.90 E:0.092191 |  after a boyage 17 was stabbed to
[3564.88 - 3566.78] P:1295.02 E:0.108442 |  death in West London. Police have
[3566.88 - 3568.78] P:2085.27 E:0.075262 |  named him as Kieran Charles. They
[3568.88 - 3570.78] P:1546.44 E:0.080022 |  dine at the scene in Shepards Bush.
[3570.88 - 3572.78] P:1999.32 E:0.085619 |  And a 25 year old man has been
[3572.88 - 3574.78] P:1544.26 E:0.097185 |  arrested over a large wildfire in
[3574.88 - 3575.78] P:1837.12 E:0.095246 |  County Dine. More than 100
[3575.88 - 3576.78] P:1617.24 E:0.106262 |  firefighters worked through the
[3576.88 - 3578.78] P:1671.71 E:0.085939 |  night in the Moore Mountains to
[3578.88 - 3580.78] P:1439.55 E:0.057811 |  try to bring it under control.
[3580.88 - 3582.78] P:2061.43 E:0.121874 |  We're Liverpool and Liverpool's

[3594.88 - 3596.78] P:1402.55 E:0.141008 |  You and me. Even if I walk away
[3596.88 - 3600.78] P:1366.08 E:0.133429 |  I'm still a target. Hmm, the good

[3604.88 - 3607.78] P:1760.68 E:0.140382 |  end I swear. Watch on BBC Eye

[3632.88 - 3635.78] P:1875.87 E:0.089510 |  Chelsea 0 is the halftime
[3635.88 - 3637.78] P:1813.36 E:0.096714 |  score. Sail away to defending
[3637.88 - 3638.78] P:1935.66 E:0.111550 |  champions Toulouse in the last
[3638.88 - 3640.78] P:1897.97 E:0.081341 |  16 of the champions cooked today.
[3640.88 - 3641.78] P:1655.82 E:0.080042 |  Kicks off at 3 o'clock. Adam
[3641.88 - 3642.78] P:1611.74 E:0.087454 |  Whitty. This perhaps the big
[3642.78 - 3644.78] P:1827.11 E:0.100501 |  biggest challenge in club rugby
[3644.88 - 3645.78] P:1696.77 E:0.127890 |  for sale as they aim to pull off
[3645.88 - 3647.78] P:1495.93 E:0.109149 |  what would be a remarkable shock
[3647.88 - 3648.78] P:1554.53 E:0.100514 |  in the South of France to reach
[3648.88 - 3649.78] P:1655.42 E:0.107097 |  their fourth Champions Cup
[3649.88 - 3651.78] P:1658.34 E:0.097342 |  quarterfinal. There's no Antoine
[3651.88 - 3652.78] P:1610.50 E:0.104486 |  Dupont for the six-time winners
[3652.88 - 3654.78] P:1713.45 E:0.104053 |  who for comparison are aiming
[3654.88 - 3656.78] P:1429.73 E:0.105297 |  for their 24th last eight match
[3656.88 - 3657.78] P:1675.10 E:0.087033 |  and they're stacked with
[3657.88 - 3659.78] P:1584.63 E:0.110812 |  international giants like Marseille,
[3659.88 - 3661.78] P:1374.93 E:0.099522 |  Ramos and Capozzo. The hosts have
[3661.88 - 3662.78] P:1729.20 E:0.115066 |  won eight of their last nine.
[3662.88 - 3664.78] P:1530.94 E:0.109330 |  They won all four of their pool
[3664.88 - 3665.78] P:2104.55 E:0.111283 |  stage games. But Alexander
[3665.88 - 3667.78] P:1729.94 E:0.113252 |  Sincere will have a lot of talent
[3667.88 - 3668.78] P:1508.07 E:0.105077 |  themselves. They welcome back
[3668.88 - 3669.78] P:1328.33 E:0.106880 |  Ben Curry is one of five changes
[3669.88 - 3671.78] P:1789.64 E:0.109079 |  from last week's Premiership
[3671.78 - 3672.78] P:1451.80 E:0.097215 |  win against Northampton with
[3672.88 - 3673.78] P:1699.02 E:0.105535 |  England international's George
[3673.88 - 3675.78] P:1762.57 E:0.100873 |  Ford, Tom Roebuck and Asher
[3675.88 - 3677.78] P:1640.27 E:0.108905 |  Apokoufoul-Gior named in a full
[3677.88 - 3679.78] P:1785.54 E:0.099095 |  strength sharks. It would perhaps
[3679.88 - 3680.78] P:1536.64 E:0.118558 |  be the biggest shock in European
[3680.88 - 3682.78] P:1555.43 E:0.107440 |  club rugby history if they were
[3682.88 - 3683.78] P:1610.75 E:0.122261 |  to win at the stadium to lose.
[3683.88 - 3685.78] P:1548.96 E:0.100833 |  But you never know. Kick off at
[3685.88 - 3687.78] P:1396.57 E:0.099071 |  3. You never know. It would be a
[3687.88 - 3688.78] P:1642.96 E:0.093033 |  big shock if St. Johnson stayed
[3688.88 - 3689.78] P:1779.66 E:0.107288 |  up in the Scottish Premiership
[3689.88 - 3691.78] P:1825.68 E:0.090189 |  this season. However, their gap
[3691.88 - 3693.78] P:1850.74 E:0.087098 |  to Dundee second bottom is now
[3693.88 - 3695.78] P:1825.00 E:0.094032 |  just five points. I say just.
[3695.88 - 3697.78] P:1924.06 E:0.100675 |  They have a 1-0 victory, St.
[3697.88 - 3699.78] P:1851.07 E:0.085277 |  Johnson this afternoon over
[3699.88 - 3700.78] P:1911.88 E:0.085474 |  Celtic, the champions elect.
[3700.78 - 3701.78] P:1930.01 E:0.098110 |  Let's hear from the St.
[3701.88 - 3703.78] P:1817.46 E:0.091806 |  Johnson boss, Seymour Valacari
[3703.88 - 3704.78] P:2036.30 E:0.093249 |  speaking to Gavin Wallace.
[3704.88 - 3705.78] P:1363.40 E:0.065458 |  We needed this to see the
[3705.88 - 3707.78] P:1126.26 E:0.094787 |  best of where we are. So we
[3707.88 - 3708.78] P:916.99 E:0.121260 |  needed this. We needed this
[3708.88 - 3710.78] P:1209.87 E:0.105720 |  performance after the last
[3710.88 - 3711.78] P:1413.91 E:0.070238 |  weekend. You know, we didn't
[3711.88 - 3714.78] P:1408.53 E:0.110247 |  perform against heaps. So yeah,
[3714.88 - 3716.78] P:1371.81 E:0.087888 |  very, very proud of our players.
[3716.88 - 3717.78] P:1098.50 E:0.080423 |  I think the question is where
[3717.88 - 3719.78] P:1733.04 E:0.132151 |  has that Johnston team been
[3719.88 - 3720.78] P:1622.88 E:0.114529 |  this season? But since you've
[3720.88 - 3721.78] P:1648.79 E:0.095038 |  come in, things have changed a
[3721.88 - 3723.78] P:1399.26 E:0.100495 |  lot. Have you, did you see
[3723.88 - 3724.78] P:1638.58 E:0.126741 |  something like this coming? Did
[3724.88 - 3725.78] P:1214.73 E:0.137059 |  you have confidence that you
[3725.88 - 3726.78] P:1580.44 E:0.125631 |  were going to get a big result
[3726.88 - 3728.78] P:1328.67 E:0.086578 |  at some point? That's a thing,
[3728.78 - 3729.78] P:816.27 E:0.131282 |  you know, because the results
[3729.88 - 3731.78] P:1394.96 E:0.094850 |  they have not been as we have
[3731.88 - 3734.78] P:1603.80 E:0.109575 |  been wanting. So as a manager,
[3734.88 - 3735.78] P:1278.13 E:0.080472 |  it's very difficult to come
[3735.88 - 3737.78] P:1383.15 E:0.119652 |  outside and see, I see what we
[3737.88 - 3739.78] P:1598.15 E:0.095815 |  are doing. I see that the boys
[3739.88 - 3741.78] P:1420.39 E:0.122188 |  have it. It's just a matter of
[3741.88 - 3742.78] P:1006.11 E:0.105361 |  time it will come out there
[3742.88 - 3743.78] P:1259.56 E:0.108543 |  because the results are not
[3743.88 - 3744.78] P:1994.79 E:0.081339 |  coming because you will be
[3744.88 - 3745.78] P:1455.49 E:0.128832 |  charged what's happening on the
[3745.88 - 3746.78] P:1111.47 E:0.097225 |  field. We are not going, but I
[3746.88 - 3748.78] P:684.11 E:0.099202 |  have knew that all the time
[3748.88 - 3749.78] P:1172.98 E:0.102433 |  that we have that, the boys
[3749.88 - 3750.78] P:1300.93 E:0.092642 |  have that. And you know, I've
[3750.88 - 3752.78] P:1667.69 E:0.100498 |  said many times, I've been
[3752.88 - 3753.78] P:1152.13 E:0.088807 |  waiting this moment that comes
[3753.88 - 3754.78] P:1236.08 E:0.105653 |  to the game. We scored two,
[3754.88 - 3756.78] P:1263.85 E:0.131581 |  three, four goals, you know, but
[3756.88 - 3757.78] P:1186.99 E:0.067181 |  today, okay, it was a different
[3757.78 - 3758.78] P:734.53 E:0.115284 |  day. It was a defending,
[3758.88 - 3760.78] P:1113.14 E:0.107411 |  defending display. We needed
[3760.88 - 3762.78] P:1183.54 E:0.105465 |  heroics from our goalkeeper,
[3762.88 - 3764.78] P:1647.22 E:0.101340 |  what a save. Everyone defended,
[3764.88 - 3766.78] P:1271.96 E:0.098118 |  followed the plan, worked for
[3766.88 - 3768.78] P:859.63 E:0.087594 |  each other. And then this is
[3768.88 - 3770.78] P:1733.51 E:0.057078 |  possible. Simo Valacari, the
[3770.88 - 3772.78] P:1871.58 E:0.089509 |  head coach of St Johnston Live,
[3772.88 - 3773.78] P:2158.08 E:0.114318 |  score you from the Scottish
[3773.88 - 3775.78] P:1872.07 E:0.094356 |  Premiership is Hearts, Nill,
[3775.88 - 3777.78] P:1899.83 E:0.090254 |  Dundee United, Nill and F1
[3777.88 - 3778.78] P:1775.98 E:0.087782 |  Red Bulls Max Verstappen has won
[3778.88 - 3779.78] P:1881.72 E:0.101477 |  the Japanese Grand Prix. Lando
[3779.88 - 3781.78] P:1843.63 E:0.088343 |  Norris was second for McLaren
[3781.88 - 3782.78] P:1663.07 E:0.087997 |  ahead of his teammate Oscar
[3782.88 - 3784.78] P:1977.83 E:0.101281 |  Piastri. So Norris leads Verstappen
[3784.88 - 3786.78] P:1836.55 E:0.090025 |  by one point in the drivers
[3786.78 - 3787.78] P:2106.83 E:0.095765 |  championship. Let's hear from
[3787.88 - 3788.78] P:2024.10 E:0.103887 |  the Dutchman. Here he is.
[3788.88 - 3789.78] P:1513.60 E:0.068692 |  On the road, of course, is great,
[3789.88 - 3791.78] P:1126.39 E:0.098602 |  but very different scenarios
[3791.88 - 3792.78] P:1017.73 E:0.103228 |  compared to, I would say, the
[3792.88 - 3794.78] P:1147.79 E:0.095299 |  last few years here, you know,
[3794.88 - 3797.78] P:1151.95 E:0.106357 |  today was key to start first.
[3797.88 - 3799.78] P:1256.13 E:0.086924 |  They were trying to get into my
[3799.88 - 3801.78] P:1090.39 E:0.109917 |  DRS, but it's very hard to follow
[3801.88 - 3803.78] P:1463.70 E:0.092771 |  around here. I think also the
[3803.88 - 3805.78] P:1339.80 E:0.110678 |  track them today helped us.
[3805.88 - 3806.78] P:924.22 E:0.082341 |  Less overheating from the tyres
[3806.88 - 3808.78] P:1102.17 E:0.104981 |  naturally when the track is
[3808.88 - 3810.78] P:1237.85 E:0.103000 |  cooler. And yeah, just
[3810.88 - 3812.78] P:1096.23 E:0.118287 |  incredibly happy with this
[3812.88 - 3813.78] P:618.03 E:0.102823 |  result.
[3813.88 - 3814.78] P:1032.54 E:0.074572 |  Touched on it there. Can you take
[3814.88 - 3815.78] P:1451.00 E:0.104565 |  us into the cockpit? I mean, how
[3815.78 - 3816.78] P:1035.61 E:0.114415 |  much pressure were you feeling
[3816.88 - 3817.78] P:1539.78 E:0.120889 |  from the McLaren's behind? And
[3817.88 - 3819.78] P:1236.63 E:0.104507 |  we did also see that moment
[3819.88 - 3821.78] P:1332.43 E:0.081573 |  exiting the pits. Could we just
[3821.88 - 3822.78] P:1225.34 E:0.103323 |  get your take on that as well?
[3822.88 - 3824.78] P:1115.88 E:0.099755 |  I was quite calm. I mean, I've
[3824.88 - 3826.78] P:1551.02 E:0.109276 |  been in this position before,
[3826.88 - 3827.78] P:1559.75 E:0.118446 |  but I just trying to focus on
[3827.88 - 3829.78] P:1182.21 E:0.095540 |  my own laps, trying to not make
[3829.88 - 3831.78] P:1378.97 E:0.103112 |  any mistakes, making sure that
[3831.88 - 3833.78] P:1003.27 E:0.095862 |  the balance was drivable, because
[3833.88 - 3834.78] P:1063.96 E:0.117138 |  of course, throughout the entire
[3834.88 - 3836.78] P:1066.89 E:0.096628 |  life, you know, it definitely
[3836.88 - 3837.78] P:1385.89 E:0.111049 |  changes the balance a bit
[3837.88 - 3840.78] P:1031.90 E:0.100081 |  front to rear. But yeah, we
[3840.88 - 3841.78] P:1369.60 E:0.126082 |  managed everything really well.
[3841.88 - 3843.78] P:875.29 E:0.109115 |  And yeah, of course, she's very
[3843.78 - 3846.78] P:1405.52 E:0.098629 |  happy with this result. And then
[3846.88 - 3847.78] P:1148.02 E:0.070644 |  of course, that bit lane thing.
[3847.88 - 3849.78] P:894.29 E:0.109555 |  Yeah, I mean, it was tight.
[3849.88 - 3851.78] P:1574.29 E:0.045776 |  That's Max Verstappen. We are
[3851.88 - 3853.78] P:1835.79 E:0.110432 |  live from inside Old Trafford.
[3853.88 - 3855.78] P:1685.27 E:0.100267 |  Full commentary this afternoon.
[3855.88 - 3857.78] P:1770.02 E:0.095647 |  Half past four of the Manchester
[3857.88 - 3859.78] P:1769.45 E:0.086317 |  Derby absolutely bathed in
[3859.88 - 3861.78] P:1797.46 E:0.093566 |  sunshine. I think I said the last
[3861.88 - 3862.78] P:1583.51 E:0.110776 |  time I was here ahead of the
[3862.88 - 3864.78] P:1817.88 E:0.104612 |  Arsenal game, you could really
[3864.88 - 3866.78] P:1954.37 E:0.086537 |  feel that spring was springing
[3866.88 - 3867.78] P:1786.43 E:0.094728 |  because for the first time you
[3867.88 - 3869.78] P:1674.51 E:0.101483 |  could sort of see the big coats
[3869.88 - 3871.78] P:1816.04 E:0.089803 |  had gone away this afternoon for
[3871.88 - 3872.78] P:1815.88 E:0.098810 |  a lot of Manchester United
[3872.78 - 3874.78] P:1889.59 E:0.101008 |  fans that we can see around us
[3874.88 - 3876.78] P:1805.33 E:0.098348 |  already inside Old Trafford.
[3876.88 - 3879.78] P:2018.38 E:0.082581 |  It's very much T shirt weather.
[3879.88 - 3881.78] P:1860.32 E:0.091701 |  So much going on. Fans protest
[3881.88 - 3883.78] P:1821.94 E:0.099618 |  that we're expecting more of from
[3883.88 - 3884.78] P:2100.21 E:0.093996 |  Manchester United supporters this
[3884.88 - 3886.78] P:1841.81 E:0.080232 |  afternoon and happy at ticket
[3886.88 - 3888.78] P:1863.05 E:0.093594 |  prices. The last Manchester
[3888.88 - 3890.78] P:1789.64 E:0.089008 |  Derby for Kevin DeBrunner as
[3890.88 - 3892.78] P:1904.33 E:0.094511 |  well. Correspondent John Murray
[3892.88 - 3893.78] P:1896.67 E:0.079150 |  is with us. There's a lot going
[3893.88 - 3894.78] P:1543.41 E:0.100635 |  on today. Good afternoon, John.
[3894.88 - 3896.78] P:1770.07 E:0.089603 |  Good afternoon, Steve. Yes, there
[3896.88 - 3897.78] P:1351.16 E:0.108504 |  is. But one thing that's not
[3897.88 - 3899.78] P:1586.01 E:0.100348 |  going on is that I think over
[3899.88 - 3901.78] P:1192.93 E:0.108707 |  many, many years now, if these
[3901.78 - 3903.78] P:1819.36 E:0.090940 |  two Manchester clubs had met
[3903.88 - 3904.78] P:1660.68 E:0.101657 |  either here or in the other
[3904.88 - 3906.78] P:1775.48 E:0.096257 |  stadium at this time of year,
[3906.88 - 3907.78] P:1040.65 E:0.117094 |  when the weather's like this,
[3907.88 - 3910.78] P:1623.64 E:0.093109 |  either one or other or actually
[3910.88 - 3912.78] P:1732.43 E:0.086460 |  even both would have had a say
[3912.88 - 3913.78] P:1293.23 E:0.098300 |  in the title race. But clearly
[3913.88 - 3915.78] P:1380.57 E:0.102741 |  that's not the case this time.
[3915.88 - 3916.78] P:1430.33 E:0.106866 |  But you're absolutely right.
[3916.88 - 3918.78] P:1704.17 E:0.095923 |  There's still plenty to hold the
[3918.88 - 3920.78] P:1798.35 E:0.085704 |  interest. So the protest, we were
[3920.88 - 3922.78] P:1849.60 E:0.091442 |  here, what, 20 days ago when it
[3922.88 - 3924.78] P:1957.05 E:0.094798 |  was fans marching outside and
[3924.88 - 3925.78] P:1771.06 E:0.091777 |  you could actually smell from
[3925.88 - 3927.78] P:1649.79 E:0.102425 |  inside the commentary position
[3927.88 - 3929.78] P:1878.71 E:0.080352 |  the cordite from the flares.
[3929.88 - 3930.78] P:1822.45 E:0.094107 |  This is almost the opposite. It's
[3930.78 - 3932.78] P:1414.37 E:0.091400 |  a city. Yeah, another it's another
[3932.88 - 3934.78] P:1672.43 E:0.102647 |  match here and another protest.
[3934.88 - 3936.78] P:1624.18 E:0.106175 |  And if you remember back to then
[3936.88 - 3938.78] P:1721.13 E:0.085527 |  it was in the aftermath of that
[3938.88 - 3939.78] P:1750.82 E:0.087673 |  that Sir Jim Radcliffe gave his
[3939.88 - 3941.78] P:1523.84 E:0.107036 |  big round of media interviews.
[3941.88 - 3942.78] P:1668.98 E:0.085981 |  Excellent view with Dan Rowan,
[3942.88 - 3944.78] P:1653.79 E:0.101175 |  which I suspect is still on BBC
[3944.88 - 3945.78] P:1555.97 E:0.115844 |  Sounds and any Manchester United
[3945.88 - 3947.78] P:1609.26 E:0.099019 |  fan who hasn't heard that, I'd
[3947.88 - 3948.78] P:989.54 E:0.097148 |  have a listen to that because
[3948.88 - 3949.78] P:1908.17 E:0.111742 |  it's very interesting. And then
[3949.88 - 3950.78] P:1772.73 E:0.091612 |  of course they announced the new
[3950.88 - 3951.78] P:1843.51 E:0.103478 |  stadium as well, the plans for
[3951.88 - 3953.78] P:1701.11 E:0.094393 |  the new stadium. However, things
[3953.88 - 3956.78] P:1639.23 E:0.098670 |  are still rumbling on that are
[3956.88 - 3958.78] P:1683.96 E:0.088418 |  really upsetting hardcore
[3958.88 - 3959.78] P:1630.62 E:0.121542 |  Manchester United fans. So it's
[3959.78 - 3962.78] P:1839.87 E:0.110029 |  the 1958 group that have
[3962.88 - 3964.78] P:1836.13 E:0.094306 |  organized what they intend to be
[3964.88 - 3966.78] P:1743.64 E:0.106505 |  a sit in today. And you're
[3966.88 - 3967.78] P:1790.16 E:0.080694 |  absolutely right. Ticket prices
[3967.88 - 3969.78] P:1665.21 E:0.102267 |  are one of the things that they
[3969.88 - 3971.78] P:1787.87 E:0.097802 |  are taking issue with. You know
[3971.88 - 3973.78] P:1832.01 E:0.084464 |  there's obviously they're taking
[3973.88 - 3975.78] P:1789.22 E:0.127822 |  huge issue with the ownership of
[3975.88 - 3976.78] P:1878.42 E:0.086284 |  Manchester United and the
[3976.88 - 3977.78] P:1537.87 E:0.107441 |  decisions that are being made.
[3977.88 - 3980.78] P:1814.49 E:0.096740 |  But yeah, ticket prices rises
[3980.88 - 3982.78] P:1679.83 E:0.115129 |  without consultation. The prices
[3982.88 - 3985.78] P:1702.47 E:0.107398 |  for OAPs or those concessions.
[3985.88 - 3988.78] P:1747.52 E:0.080915 |  Also this this matter of they
[3988.78 - 3990.78] P:1781.33 E:0.097487 |  say 500 fans are going to be
[3990.88 - 3992.78] P:1829.65 E:0.113612 |  moved from next season. Fans
[3992.88 - 3994.78] P:1503.08 E:0.087637 |  who've sat together for decades
[3994.88 - 3995.78] P:1887.24 E:0.085043 |  because there's going to be a
[3995.88 - 3996.78] P:1602.95 E:0.107828 |  sort of tunnel club style
[3996.88 - 3998.78] P:1724.88 E:0.097500 |  situation that we've seen in
[3998.88 - 3999.78] P:1340.96 E:0.086491 |  quite a number of other football
[3999.88 - 4001.78] P:1672.14 E:0.100904 |  grounds. Manchester City, for
[4001.88 - 4003.78] P:1669.36 E:0.089442 |  example, Brighton as well. And
[4003.88 - 4006.78] P:1665.35 E:0.103633 |  they say the 1958 group quotes
[4006.88 - 4008.78] P:1588.83 E:0.109008 |  football is more than just being
[4008.88 - 4010.78] P:1737.27 E:0.097903 |  a number on a seat where fans
[4010.88 - 4012.78] P:1566.38 E:0.119899 |  can be replaced by more lucrative
[4012.88 - 4015.78] P:1827.32 E:0.077413 |  customers. So we will have if
[4015.88 - 4017.78] P:1842.82 E:0.076474 |  this goes to plan a sit in
[4017.78 - 4019.78] P:1680.67 E:0.096607 |  inside Old Trafford and rather
[4019.88 - 4021.78] P:1738.79 E:0.094475 |  as at Tottenham a few weeks ago,
[4021.88 - 4023.78] P:1815.43 E:0.093338 |  it'll be a case of just saying
[4023.88 - 4024.78] P:1422.96 E:0.114180 |  what the effect of that is and
[4024.88 - 4025.78] P:821.34 E:0.130892 |  how many people get involved.
[4025.88 - 4026.78] P:1931.55 E:0.073186 |  Leon Osmond is with us for
[4026.88 - 4027.78] P:1648.38 E:0.092329 |  commentary this afternoon. Good
[4027.88 - 4029.78] P:1724.11 E:0.102412 |  afternoon. Good afternoon, Steve.
[4029.88 - 4031.78] P:1984.27 E:0.079994 |  Every time that we watch
[4031.88 - 4033.78] P:1907.13 E:0.093062 |  Manchester City in person now
[4033.88 - 4035.78] P:1624.42 E:0.100527 |  could well be the last time that
[4035.88 - 4037.78] P:1958.67 E:0.089006 |  we watch Kevin DeBrona, which I
[4037.88 - 4038.78] P:1936.14 E:0.094112 |  just think from a neutrals
[4038.88 - 4039.78] P:1905.73 E:0.075542 |  perspective is actually quite
[4039.88 - 4043.78] P:1814.34 E:0.062397 |  sad. Yeah, I mean, I make a
[4043.88 - 4045.78] P:1817.37 E:0.101249 |  similar feeling to how I felt
[4045.88 - 4046.78] P:1795.06 E:0.051909 |  when that David Silver was
[4046.78 - 4047.78] P:1673.24 E:0.095243 |  leaving Manchester City and what
[4047.88 - 4049.78] P:1911.98 E:0.081341 |  a wonderful servant. He'd be
[4049.88 - 4050.78] P:1365.30 E:0.105854 |  one of my favourite all time
[4050.88 - 4052.78] P:1478.50 E:0.101062 |  players to play in the Premier
[4052.88 - 4053.78] P:1833.11 E:0.083196 |  League and knowing that each
[4053.88 - 4054.78] P:2046.23 E:0.084577 |  time you see him could be the
[4054.88 - 4057.78] P:1820.76 E:0.078769 |  last. It's sad in a sense that,
[4057.88 - 4059.78] P:1554.88 E:0.098134 |  you know, we're no longer going
[4059.88 - 4060.78] P:1951.61 E:0.099376 |  to see those moments of magic
[4060.88 - 4062.78] P:1777.97 E:0.081039 |  from an outstanding player, but
[4062.88 - 4064.78] P:1983.50 E:0.085994 |  it does make you appreciate what
[4064.88 - 4065.78] P:1589.23 E:0.100356 |  they've done. It does make you
[4065.88 - 4066.78] P:1893.46 E:0.066474 |  look back at some of their
[4066.88 - 4067.78] P:1939.77 E:0.079081 |  special moments, what they've
[4067.88 - 4069.78] P:1805.35 E:0.098794 |  achieved, what they've been a part
[4069.88 - 4071.78] P:1804.45 E:0.084008 |  of, why they've made the Premier
[4071.88 - 4073.78] P:1922.12 E:0.082441 |  League so special. And yeah, I
[4073.88 - 4075.78] P:1815.99 E:0.089118 |  hope that those players get the
[4075.78 - 4076.78] P:2202.11 E:0.106290 |  appreciation, it's Kevin DeBrona
[4076.88 - 4077.78] P:1085.88 E:0.103599 |  at the moment, that they deserve
[4077.88 - 4079.78] P:1936.65 E:0.087714 |  from away supporters, not just
[4079.88 - 4080.78] P:1758.14 E:0.102580 |  the City fans who are going to
[4080.88 - 4082.78] P:1518.41 E:0.104337 |  enjoy him, but away supporters. I
[4082.88 - 4083.78] P:1818.29 E:0.094476 |  doubt he'll get that kind of
[4083.88 - 4085.78] P:1821.79 E:0.074471 |  that kind of sense of where you're
[4085.88 - 4086.78] P:1766.96 E:0.123048 |  going. I've got to be honest, I
[4086.88 - 4088.78] P:1676.15 E:0.104271 |  doubt he'll get that here, but
[4088.88 - 4090.78] P:1789.40 E:0.069367 |  he'll be, you know, to take part
[4090.88 - 4092.78] P:1904.15 E:0.089689 |  in these big fixtures, these local
[4092.88 - 4094.78] P:1914.41 E:0.074597 |  rivalries. You want to make sure
[4094.88 - 4095.78] P:1881.89 E:0.115561 |  that every one of every time
[4095.88 - 4096.78] P:1779.13 E:0.097141 |  you're out there, this from
[4096.88 - 4098.78] P:1723.93 E:0.095909 |  Kevin DeBrona that he puts on a
[4098.88 - 4099.78] P:1826.15 E:0.095755 |  show and I'm hoping we're all
[4099.88 - 4100.78] P:1313.81 E:0.097724 |  going to be able to see him do
[4100.88 - 4101.78] P:1664.15 E:0.088583 |  that. Yeah, I'm just watching
[4101.88 - 4102.78] P:1373.71 E:0.123709 |  another one down there on the
[4102.88 - 4103.78] P:1743.74 E:0.109808 |  side of the pitch at the moment,
[4103.88 - 4104.78] P:1293.37 E:0.130151 |  who's one of the best midfielders
[4104.78 - 4106.78] P:1914.90 E:0.094219 |  that has graced this game over
[4106.88 - 4108.78] P:1856.39 E:0.098332 |  the course of recent decades.
[4108.88 - 4109.78] P:2011.13 E:0.068523 |  Brian Robson's down there,
[4109.88 - 4110.78] P:1808.77 E:0.101430 |  totally different player to
[4110.88 - 4112.78] P:1663.88 E:0.107073 |  Kevin DeBrona, but certainly
[4112.88 - 4113.78] P:1727.27 E:0.111643 |  deserves to be in the
[4113.88 - 4114.78] P:1634.41 E:0.106069 |  conversation when people are
[4114.88 - 4116.78] P:1756.07 E:0.107596 |  talking about the best midfielders
[4116.88 - 4119.78] P:1754.65 E:0.101056 |  that have graced the English top
[4119.88 - 4121.78] P:1836.95 E:0.101662 |  flight. But yeah, for Kevin De
[4121.88 - 4123.78] P:1794.51 E:0.089806 |  Brona, I thought she had given
[4123.88 - 4124.78] P:1735.80 E:0.079747 |  earlier in the programme, was
[4124.88 - 4125.78] P:1884.86 E:0.064417 |  spot on when he called him the
[4125.88 - 4126.78] P:1691.96 E:0.128166 |  ace in the pack, or the diamond
[4126.88 - 4127.78] P:1531.82 E:0.096981 |  in the pack, I think he called
[4127.88 - 4129.78] P:1411.34 E:0.116851 |  it. Right, we've got much more
[4129.88 - 4130.78] P:1404.21 E:0.096906 |  build up to come. Clearly we'll
[4130.88 - 4131.78] P:1896.62 E:0.085585 |  talk more about Kevin DeBrona
[4131.88 - 4132.78] P:1790.51 E:0.103586 |  and his team, but I think we'll
[4132.78 - 4134.78] P:1699.64 E:0.089539 |  have to talk about the
[4134.88 - 4135.78] P:2013.33 E:0.088756 |  team. We've got a lot of
[4135.88 - 4136.78] P:1628.40 E:0.110618 |  questions coming up to come.
[4136.88 - 4137.78] P:1975.34 E:0.104130 |  Clearly we'll talk more about
[4137.88 - 4139.78] P:1815.77 E:0.097438 |  Kevin DeBrona and Manchester
[4139.88 - 4140.78] P:1689.58 E:0.092154 |  United as well. Beautiful day
[4140.88 - 4142.78] P:1942.19 E:0.105277 |  here inside Old Trafford, but
[4142.88 - 4144.78] P:1686.59 E:0.104410 |  we've got three full commentaries
[4144.88 - 4145.78] P:1853.40 E:0.093537 |  that you can listen to right
[4145.88 - 4147.78] P:1756.79 E:0.090613 |  now. Spurs Southampton Spurs

[4158.88 - 4159.78] P:1830.17 E:0.111632 |  Thanks very much, Steve. Yet
[4159.88 - 4161.78] P:1890.08 E:0.112515 |  perfect timing just about good
[4161.78 - 4163.78] P:1937.66 E:0.109433 |  for the team. The team is
[4163.88 - 4164.78] P:1887.29 E:0.089310 |  still in the lead. They're
[4164.88 - 4167.78] P:1776.44 E:0.123452 |  trailing by three goals to one.
[4167.88 - 4169.78] P:1918.74 E:0.104625 |  No changes from either manager
[4169.88 - 4170.78] P:1942.67 E:0.109881 |  during the interval. So I'll
[4170.88 - 4171.78] P:1741.23 E:0.094576 |  run you through the team

[4184.88 - 4186.78] P:1815.43 E:0.108171 |  area and Robinson Bassie up the
[4186.88 - 4188.78] P:1869.86 E:0.112238 |  line into Rodrigo Munoz who
[4188.88 - 4190.78] P:1823.21 E:0.099797 |  scored an absolute belter to
[4190.78 - 4191.78] P:1879.47 E:0.119108 |  Nearsham. Chelsea Nail
[4191.88 - 4193.78] P:1730.65 E:0.121046 |  obviously won at 10 30 to see
[4193.88 - 4195.78] P:1657.90 E:0.112341 |  that goal and all of the others
[4195.88 - 4196.78] P:1753.67 E:0.068911 |  from today's Premier League
[4196.88 - 4198.78] P:1698.83 E:0.113397 |  action. He needs to be better
[4198.88 - 4200.28] P:1773.15 E:0.131920 |  though. Salah in the second
[4200.38 - 4201.78] P:1656.61 E:0.098781 |  half. He's not working nowhere
[4201.88 - 4203.78] P:1787.70 E:0.092201 |  near as hard as he was doing
[4203.88 - 4204.78] P:1758.45 E:0.124344 |  previously. And I've seen it.
[4204.88 - 4205.78] P:1704.08 E:0.080434 |  Not saying I've seen him down
[4205.88 - 4207.78] P:1719.08 E:0.092140 |  tools, but it has to look like
[4207.88 - 4209.78] P:1820.76 E:0.100357 |  common. I know you think it
[4209.88 - 4211.78] P:1710.81 E:0.114142 |  might be over. Not at Liverpool.
[4211.88 - 4212.78] P:1674.16 E:0.130745 |  I'm not talking about him at
[4212.88 - 4213.78] P:1938.04 E:0.089724 |  Liverpool. I mean the Premier
[4213.88 - 4214.78] P:1959.88 E:0.113731 |  League, but he needs to work
[4214.88 - 4215.78] P:1942.20 E:0.091091 |  harder for his team. And that
[4215.88 - 4216.78] P:1710.15 E:0.099896 |  is the world class players.
[4216.88 - 4217.78] P:1963.43 E:0.099438 |  When you see my having the
[4217.88 - 4218.78] P:1655.99 E:0.068912 |  downtime, you need your
[4218.88 - 4219.78] P:2062.71 E:0.119757 |  world class players to step
[4219.88 - 4220.68] P:1667.56 E:0.121311 |  up. Sasha Lucas just picked
[4220.78 - 4224.82] P:1741.25 E:0.100820 |  for Trakinback, Kravenberg, midway inside the Fulham half.
[4224.82 - 4226.94] P:1731.23 E:0.108576 |  So that's the first yellow of the game,
[4226.94 - 4230.06] P:1760.56 E:0.103770 |  and McAllister is over the free kick for Liverpool.
[4230.06 - 4233.78] P:1681.19 E:0.111303 |  The shadows just start to grow across the far side of the pitch
[4233.78 - 4236.74] P:1559.96 E:0.110430 |  to us, underneath that imposing Riverside stand.
[4236.74 - 4239.94] P:1745.01 E:0.110863 |  McAllister lifts it in, but it's catching practice for Burt Lano,
[4239.94 - 4241.66] P:1897.65 E:0.109205 |  so he can run you through the teams now.
[4241.66 - 4244.70] P:1675.95 E:0.110845 |  Lano in goal for Fulham, Robinson, Basi Anderson and Kastania,
[4244.70 - 4247.14] P:1848.54 E:0.105431 |  the back four, Lukic and Berger in midfield
[4247.14 - 4250.50] P:1813.42 E:0.113453 |  with a Wobie, Pereira and Sessignon behind Muniz up top.
[4250.54 - 4252.50] P:1819.37 E:0.111040 |  Liverpool with Kelaher in goal,
[4252.50 - 4254.90] P:1768.73 E:0.106953 |  Robinson, who had a shocker for one of the Fulham goals,
[4254.90 - 4257.62] P:1789.02 E:0.102249 |  Van Dyke, Kanate and Jones there back four.
[4257.62 - 4260.30] P:1717.24 E:0.098941 |  McAllister has scored a belter to put Liverpool in front
[4260.30 - 4263.86] P:1762.60 E:0.101535 |  with Subosla and Kravenberg, the midfield three, Gakpo Jota,
[4263.86 - 4267.34] P:1643.75 E:0.101610 |  and a pretty quiet most, Salah, are there front three.
[4267.34 - 4270.54] P:1765.14 E:0.111821 |  Flipped on by a Wobie for Fulham, midway inside, Liverpool territory,
[4270.54 - 4272.02] P:1649.45 E:0.097414 |  but Liverpool have enough bodies,
[4272.02 - 4273.58] P:1662.63 E:0.116099 |  Batlett are clear up towards halfway.
[4273.58 - 4276.54] P:1826.93 E:0.114802 |  Good turn by Salah Berger inside the centre-circle,
[4276.54 - 4279.02] P:1703.90 E:0.108962 |  to wriggle clear of a couple of Liverpool players,
[4279.06 - 4281.62] P:1647.64 E:0.098655 |  and now it's with Kastania, the Belgian right back,
[4281.62 - 4283.38] P:1757.75 E:0.113064 |  who plays it into the feet of Sessignon,
[4283.38 - 4285.62] P:1805.33 E:0.112580 |  who took his goal very nicely indeed,
[4285.62 - 4289.38] P:1771.06 E:0.109727 |  three goals in his last five league games for Ryan Sessignon,
[4289.38 - 4292.94] P:1597.36 E:0.112891 |  as Lano launches it into the sunshine up towards halfway.
[4292.94 - 4295.26] P:1747.51 E:0.121321 |  Another nice touch from Muniz to get away from Van Dyke.
[4295.26 - 4297.34] P:1675.16 E:0.106688 |  He's laid it off this time for Sander Berger,
[4297.34 - 4301.34] P:1728.36 E:0.104171 |  who brings it over the halfway line into the feet of Sasha Lukic,
[4301.34 - 4304.90] P:1858.31 E:0.094316 |  and Lukic can play it short to Basi,
[4304.90 - 4308.34] P:1629.19 E:0.101734 |  and Basi under pressure can work a dyag pass
[4308.34 - 4309.50] P:1610.14 E:0.110905 |  in towards the feet of him.
[4309.50 - 4314.18] P:1704.89 E:0.112383 |  Wobie, who's challenged by Canate, it was a lunging tackle, but fair,
[4314.18 - 4317.22] P:1708.18 E:0.115953 |  and now Salah's picked up the ball after a mistake from Basi.
[4317.22 - 4318.22] P:1677.97 E:0.116352 |  Most Salah motoring,
[4318.22 - 4320.54] P:1878.64 E:0.118867 |  Trash of Flick and through for Jota!
[4320.54 - 4322.74] P:1859.40 E:0.115385 |  Who can't take the chocks.
[4322.74 - 4327.90] P:1897.83 E:0.118177 |  Kurt Lano with a sprawling save to deny Diogo Jota,
[4327.90 - 4331.78] P:1822.58 E:0.119833 |  who we've got used to being so deadly from that kind of situation,
[4331.78 - 4335.18] P:1677.72 E:0.108841 |  but the Germans spread himself well to keep it at 3-1.
[4335.18 - 4336.54] P:1839.85 E:0.100575 |  Yeah, that's better from Salah.
[4336.62 - 4339.46] P:1695.81 E:0.111795 |  Basi makes a mistake, and Salah plays a clever little ball
[4339.46 - 4341.74] P:1895.72 E:0.106683 |  through to Jota, and he should be scoring Jota.
[4341.74 - 4344.10] P:1745.40 E:0.112739 |  Said earlier in the programme, he's the best finisher at Liverpool,
[4344.10 - 4346.42] P:1878.43 E:0.103008 |  but credit to Bert Lano, he stands up ever so well,
[4346.42 - 4348.38] P:1759.07 E:0.089514 |  but he just couldn't get the ball out of his feet.
[4348.38 - 4351.30] P:1592.89 E:0.094438 |  He's unlucky to be fair, it's a good save from Lano.
[4351.30 - 4353.58] P:1773.68 E:0.118140 |  He hasn't got a great record against Liverpool, Bert Lano.
[4353.58 - 4355.74] P:1572.84 E:0.089899 |  He's not one against him,
[4355.74 - 4358.78] P:1787.96 E:0.112955 |  conceded 28 goals in his 12 games against him,
[4358.78 - 4361.54] P:1802.15 E:0.105556 |  but kept that one out and now gets a fist to this corner,
[4361.54 - 4363.90] P:1802.81 E:0.106878 |  which clears it as far as Mohs Salah.
[4363.90 - 4365.46] P:1669.16 E:0.110292 |  Down by the corner flag on the right side,
[4365.46 - 4366.54] P:1715.68 E:0.104430 |  there's Liverpool look at things,
[4366.54 - 4370.06] P:1667.86 E:0.111162 |  he will let the ball dribble out for a throw to Arna Slott's men,
[4370.06 - 4372.38] P:1458.06 E:0.092515 |  and Salah thinks about taking it himself.
[4373.26 - 4375.74] P:1509.94 E:0.130030 |  Welcome back to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
[4375.74 - 4377.14] P:1720.02 E:0.120779 |  Two teams known for the marching,
[4377.14 - 4379.74] P:1778.10 E:0.114517 |  are heading in decidedly different directions.
[4379.74 - 4382.58] P:1812.69 E:0.104270 |  It spurs to Southampton Neal at the break,
[4382.58 - 4386.26] P:1671.59 E:0.101476 |  and we are about to get back on the way here in north London.
[4386.26 - 4388.14] P:1747.92 E:0.115056 |  Southampton kicking from left to right,
[4388.14 - 4392.38] P:1630.23 E:0.099784 |  get us going again in a kit of pink and white.
[4392.38 - 4394.38] P:1661.83 E:0.094845 |  I'll put my teeth back in again, Stephen Kelly,
[4394.42 - 4398.82] P:1657.06 E:0.100949 |  as spurs kick in from right to left in white and navy blue.
[4398.82 - 4400.98] P:1716.98 E:0.113020 |  Leading by two goals to Neal,
[4400.98 - 4405.30] P:1665.81 E:0.097510 |  Southampton will be relegated in the next 45 minutes or so,
[4405.30 - 4407.22] P:1563.14 E:0.094256 |  if they can't turn this around,
[4407.22 - 4411.38] P:1460.71 E:0.106310 |  and there is no reason to believe that they will be able to turn this around
[4411.38 - 4412.98] P:1441.91 E:0.069753 |  at this stage of the season.
[4412.98 - 4415.10] P:1393.63 E:0.096085 |  No, not from that foreside showing,
[4415.10 - 4416.74] P:1277.10 E:0.082027 |  not from the way Tottenham have played.
[4416.74 - 4420.90] P:1558.18 E:0.082379 |  You feel it's very much that they're going to get relegated today.
[4420.90 - 4423.30] P:1721.29 E:0.091843 |  I'd love to see a better showing from them,
[4423.34 - 4425.02] P:1589.53 E:0.103184 |  I'd love to see a team that has a bit of fight,
[4425.02 - 4427.50] P:1524.06 E:0.070978 |  but they look like they're dejected.
[4427.50 - 4429.74] P:1491.36 E:0.104605 |  The confidence is so low as a squad,
[4429.74 - 4432.58] P:1301.09 E:0.074316 |  and yeah, you feel it's just inevitable today.
[4432.58 - 4433.90] P:1857.71 E:0.113251 |  Two Brennan Johnson goals.
[4433.90 - 4435.34] P:1673.78 E:0.096793 |  The difference in the first half,
[4435.34 - 4437.18] P:1693.58 E:0.103101 |  Lucas Bergwald also scored,
[4437.18 - 4439.94] P:1628.61 E:0.091515 |  but that was ruled out after a VAR check
[4439.94 - 4442.02] P:1697.10 E:0.102103 |  that lasted more than five minutes,
[4442.02 - 4444.18] P:1670.11 E:0.075325 |  ruled out for offside.
[4444.18 - 4448.90] P:1779.28 E:0.084760 |  As I mentioned, Southampton in the kit of pink shirts and shorts,
[4448.90 - 4451.38] P:1861.26 E:0.091369 |  pink shirts and socks and white shorts,
[4451.42 - 4454.30] P:1321.57 E:0.096913 |  Tottenham in their home kit of white and navy blue.
[4454.30 - 4458.18] P:1527.63 E:0.089407 |  They line up with Vicario in goal, no changes at halftime.
[4458.18 - 4462.34] P:1365.86 E:0.093786 |  Porro, Romero, Davis and Spence at the back in midfield.
[4462.34 - 4465.14] P:1343.02 E:0.080962 |  Bergwald, Bentoncourt and Madison up top,
[4465.14 - 4467.82] P:1706.56 E:0.089950 |  Johnson, Solanke and Sun Xiong Min.
[4467.82 - 4469.78] P:1358.78 E:0.098533 |  Kyle Walker-Peters on the ball for Southampton,
[4469.78 - 4471.30] P:1586.05 E:0.098585 |  goes down, looks to have hurt himself.
[4471.30 - 4473.66] P:1558.17 E:0.092595 |  Referee, I don't think was going to give a free kick,
[4473.66 - 4476.82] P:1480.32 E:0.108567 |  but has now taken sympathy with the Southampton player,
[4476.82 - 4478.54] P:1473.60 E:0.089834 |  the former Tottenham Academy product,
[4478.54 - 4480.54] P:1493.88 E:0.088879 |  who's being helped up by Bentoncourt,
[4480.58 - 4482.70] P:1668.80 E:0.089005 |  and it will be a free kick to the Saints,
[4482.70 - 4485.78] P:1685.87 E:0.090141 |  around five yards or so inside Tottenham territory,
[4485.78 - 4487.34] P:1702.63 E:0.082889 |  no changes either for the Saints.
[4487.34 - 4489.22] P:1647.41 E:0.101794 |  Ramsdale in goal, who's kept them in it,
[4489.22 - 4492.14] P:1641.98 E:0.106617 |  if they are in fact in it anyway with the score being 2-0,
[4492.14 - 4495.26] P:1689.54 E:0.089323 |  it would have been five if it weren't for some brilliant stops
[4495.26 - 4496.38] P:1311.68 E:0.102483 |  from Aaron Ramsdale.
[4496.38 - 4499.74] P:1563.46 E:0.086263 |  Back four of Walker-Peters, Harwood-Bellis, Bednarek and Manning.
[4499.74 - 4503.10] P:1693.56 E:0.106357 |  In midfield, Ugarchukwu and Arebo playing slightly further forwards
[4503.10 - 4505.10] P:1480.00 E:0.091363 |  on the right, dibbling the left Sulamana
[4505.10 - 4508.46] P:1472.43 E:0.081778 |  with Matias Fernandez in behind Cameron Archer.
[4508.46 - 4510.94] P:1631.84 E:0.095579 |  This free kick to be taken by Fernandez,
[4510.94 - 4514.46] P:1759.92 E:0.096205 |  launched long up towards the edge of the Spurs penalty area.
[4514.46 - 4516.02] P:1684.22 E:0.095646 |  Ugarchukwu got the telling touch,
[4516.02 - 4517.98] P:1606.67 E:0.094523 |  but it lands at the feet of Bentoncourt,
[4517.98 - 4520.78] P:1706.64 E:0.079137 |  who smashes it off of Bednarek,
[4520.78 - 4522.18] P:1591.72 E:0.089523 |  in fact, might be Harwood-Bellis,
[4522.18 - 4525.14] P:1323.44 E:0.076998 |  and it's a goal kick that's been taken quickly by Vakariam.
[4527.94 - 4530.78] P:1497.14 E:0.120725 |  It's weird, you know when Vakariam takes those quick free kicks
[4530.78 - 4534.30] P:1205.24 E:0.112136 |  from the back, Tottenham wearing set against a better side,
[4534.30 - 4535.86] P:1673.27 E:0.090358 |  which I watched here a few times,
[4535.86 - 4537.90] P:1307.08 E:0.116860 |  they've just got pressed and they've lost the ball to the Tampton here,
[4537.90 - 4539.62] P:1096.70 E:0.100858 |  but Tottenham are not set to play that.
[4539.62 - 4542.02] P:1522.25 E:0.112087 |  The team aren't in position, they're midfield, they're in position,
[4542.02 - 4544.94] P:1475.98 E:0.099032 |  and they've just given Southampton an opportunity to go and press them,
[4544.94 - 4546.62] P:1368.65 E:0.107887 |  and they've done it, they've won the ball back.
[4546.62 - 4548.38] P:1424.09 E:0.090851 |  Sulamana finds Manning,
[4548.38 - 4551.06] P:1552.81 E:0.115481 |  header away from the resulting cross by Romero,
[4551.06 - 4554.66] P:1556.46 E:0.094782 |  up in the direction of Solanke, who tries to flick it in to his path,
[4554.66 - 4555.94] P:1367.00 E:0.124521 |  but it's broken up once more,
[4555.94 - 4561.06] P:1385.78 E:0.099232 |  and this is the most that Southampton have been inside Tottenham territory all afternoon.
[4561.06 - 4563.18] P:1189.33 E:0.118446 |  And it resulted from Vakariam putting the ball down,
[4563.18 - 4565.78] P:1536.64 E:0.097114 |  applying a quick free kick in his own box
[4565.78 - 4569.34] P:1444.54 E:0.107504 |  to a player who's not even really looking at the ball in Ben Davies,
[4569.34 - 4571.90] P:1279.77 E:0.106307 |  and the midfield are set, they're running with their back away,
[4571.90 - 4573.22] P:1520.76 E:0.100474 |  facing away from play,
[4573.22 - 4574.90] P:1327.73 E:0.117458 |  Solanke hasn't got himself in the position,
[4574.90 - 4577.50] P:1220.33 E:0.080826 |  so with them and the trade, the play does pass us.
[4577.50 - 4581.66] P:1357.88 E:0.116838 |  Sulamana's done really well to get the other side of Pedro Porro for a moment,
[4581.66 - 4583.10] P:1448.79 E:0.124535 |  cut into the penalty area,
[4583.10 - 4586.54] P:1494.38 E:0.105745 |  but the Spurs defenders descended upon him, blocked his cross,
[4586.54 - 4589.46] P:1575.28 E:0.091838 |  and then smashed it clear up in the direction of Solanke,
[4589.46 - 4591.86] P:1265.23 E:0.116001 |  up near the halfway line, and Southampton have it back again,
[4591.86 - 4595.74] P:1508.52 E:0.111154 |  and it's just a bit eerily quiet here inside this giant arena,
[4595.74 - 4598.86] P:898.61 E:0.117617 |  a wonderful place to watch football on a beautiful afternoon like this.
[4598.86 - 4603.30] P:1481.61 E:0.105643 |  There's not a cloud in the sky hanging over the top of the Tottenham-Hottensperre stadium,
[4603.30 - 4607.18] P:1584.89 E:0.107281 |  but at the moment with fan skills slowly making their way back in from the T-bars,
[4607.18 - 4608.90] P:1556.37 E:0.081312 |  if they have them in such a nice place,
[4608.90 - 4614.34] P:1597.12 E:0.104740 |  and Spurs really struggling out the traps to start this second half,
[4614.34 - 4616.78] P:1189.44 E:0.102153 |  it's a place devoid of atmosphere at the moment,
[4616.78 - 4619.34] P:1392.08 E:0.101671 |  and Southampton win their first corner kick of the afternoon.
[4619.34 - 4624.94] P:1149.95 E:0.106006 |  Well, there's a real sense of complacency about this Tottenham side,
[4624.94 - 4627.26] P:907.64 E:0.080875 |  the way they've come out the second half.
[4627.26 - 4629.42] P:1371.32 E:0.122467 |  You know, they should be coming out revved up,
[4629.42 - 4631.42] P:1314.67 E:0.105197 |  knowing what they have coming on Thursday,
[4631.42 - 4635.02] P:1612.45 E:0.094591 |  and wanting to finish this game off on a high, finish it off strongly,
[4635.02 - 4638.58] P:1269.05 E:0.104221 |  and put the sore to Southampton side who are devoid of any confidence,
[4638.58 - 4640.34] P:1292.85 E:0.102944 |  but Southampton have started better.
[4640.34 - 4642.34] P:1343.66 E:0.108574 |  They'll have needed to as well,
[4642.34 - 4645.82] P:1687.10 E:0.111220 |  even Eurich will have surely said that to his charges at halftime,
[4645.82 - 4648.06] P:1257.57 E:0.113129 |  that they need to start this second half well,
[4648.06 - 4650.58] P:1566.47 E:0.116018 |  as the ball is curled into the penalty area,
[4650.58 - 4654.66] P:1655.60 E:0.106720 |  and Vicario comes and flies, dressed top to toe,
[4654.66 - 4657.34] P:1350.47 E:0.100365 |  in bright yellow, and makes a good claim of the ball.
[4657.34 - 4659.02] P:1421.56 E:0.089806 |  You don't see keepers do that that often.
[4659.02 - 4661.98] P:1501.59 E:0.105373 |  Nowadays, they tend to want to punch those away,
[4661.98 - 4665.66] P:1346.87 E:0.095655 |  but that was a really good claim from the Italian number one.
[4665.66 - 4666.98] P:1146.24 E:0.093982 |  Yeah, it is.
[4666.98 - 4670.90] P:1277.94 E:0.113034 |  And Vicario, who has had a lot of criticism throughout the season,
[4670.90 - 4674.26] P:1396.11 E:0.093094 |  for being not as physical as he should be,
[4674.26 - 4677.30] P:1316.06 E:0.095920 |  or as dominant in his box as you expect your goalkeeper,
[4677.30 - 4680.26] P:1169.00 E:0.097985 |  and from a defender's point of view, or what's horn.
[4680.26 - 4682.46] P:1479.07 E:0.123748 |  Yeah, Rebo's left Romero for dead.
[4682.46 - 4684.90] P:1675.95 E:0.115090 |  These two yards outside of the penalty area pulls the trigger,
[4684.90 - 4688.02] P:1450.59 E:0.109259 |  it's blocked by Bentonker, and deflects into the path of Romero,
[4688.02 - 4691.62] P:1596.66 E:0.112552 |  and now Spurs will perhaps think of counter-attacking in their own right.
[4691.62 - 4693.42] P:1290.05 E:0.091788 |  They won't do, put the foot on the ball,
[4693.42 - 4695.78] P:1580.96 E:0.101193 |  five minutes played of this second half,
[4695.78 - 4698.06] P:1469.87 E:0.099713 |  of which Spurs are really yet to start it,
[4698.06 - 4700.70] P:1219.01 E:0.107744 |  and Spence will find Sun on the left wing,
[4700.70 - 4703.10] P:1339.71 E:0.100926 |  Sun cutting in, looking for Madison,
[4703.10 - 4705.46] P:1358.07 E:0.109037 |  really poor ball from the Spurs skipper.
[4705.46 - 4707.54] P:1485.39 E:0.096163 |  So it's 2-0 to Tottenham here,
[4707.54 - 4711.90] P:1446.28 E:0.100694 |  still 3-1 to Fulham against Liverpool in West London,
[4711.94 - 4714.94] P:1459.22 E:0.102783 |  as it is also goal-less between Brentford and Chelsea.
[4714.94 - 4717.06] P:1492.41 E:0.111616 |  You can listen to the last of those three games I mentioned
[4717.06 - 4718.38] P:1509.28 E:0.096788 |  on the BBC Sport website.
[4718.38 - 4721.34] P:1303.02 E:0.109842 |  Fulham Liverpool is on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[4721.34 - 4724.06] P:1484.08 E:0.113005 |  We're available for you throughout the remainder of this game
[4724.06 - 4727.70] P:1654.12 E:0.106421 |  on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, and it'll be a Southampton throwing.
[4727.70 - 4729.26] P:1721.41 E:0.113905 |  Stephen Kelly, you've been through this,
[4729.26 - 4731.26] P:1204.44 E:0.104822 |  you've been relegated from the Premier League,
[4731.26 - 4733.10] P:1709.42 E:0.130802 |  we won't linger on it for obvious reasons.
[4733.10 - 4734.22] P:1518.53 E:0.116691 |  Cheers, Charlie, cheers.
[4734.22 - 4735.98] P:1349.77 E:0.086732 |  You're very welcome.
[4735.98 - 4739.34] P:1411.83 E:0.105003 |  What are these Southampton players going through on an afternoon like this?
[4739.34 - 4744.22] P:1289.35 E:0.104731 |  Well, fortunately, I've not been relegated this early on,
[4744.22 - 4746.70] P:1216.78 E:0.101981 |  or in this sort of state where your 10 points in,
[4746.70 - 4749.50] P:1256.75 E:0.102360 |  I've been in fights till the end of the season
[4749.50 - 4752.70] P:1423.77 E:0.111473 |  and gone down on the last day, which was really tough to take.
[4752.70 - 4754.70] P:1342.19 E:0.099136 |  But you are alone, confidence.
[4754.70 - 4757.42] P:1512.74 E:0.112859 |  You're trying to find the way to win, you're trying to find the way.
[4757.42 - 4760.06] P:1208.37 E:0.111230 |  You know, when you go on a run of a losing streak,
[4760.06 - 4762.78] P:1334.35 E:0.098597 |  or you feel that you just don't have enough in the tank,
[4762.78 - 4765.66] P:1434.63 E:0.102302 |  what can motivate you, what gets you for these games?
[4765.66 - 4767.98] P:1382.86 E:0.098468 |  And it has to be something internally
[4767.98 - 4771.58] P:1408.04 E:0.115830 |  that makes you want to turn up, that makes you want to prove how good you are,
[4771.58 - 4774.38] P:1181.38 E:0.083998 |  prove that you deserve to be at this level.
[4774.38 - 4777.02] P:1458.90 E:0.103123 |  Even Eurich says that their whole motivation
[4777.02 - 4779.58] P:1451.82 E:0.094677 |  is to not go down as the worst team ever.
[4779.58 - 4781.58] P:1526.24 E:0.109338 |  Odd motivation, as that might well be,
[4781.58 - 4784.14] P:1398.98 E:0.093717 |  but if it works, it works at the moment, it's not doing.
[4784.14 - 4786.30] P:1334.59 E:0.115426 |  Though they've started this second half really well,
[4786.30 - 4789.10] P:1221.23 E:0.106154 |  Manning does well to keep the ball in and finds a Rebo,
[4789.10 - 4792.38] P:1564.76 E:0.106852 |  turns it up the left touch line as Southampton kick from left to right
[4792.38 - 4794.14] P:1226.40 E:0.092718 |  in front of us, they attack the end,
[4794.14 - 4797.34] P:1586.83 E:0.106376 |  which is backed by that giant Spurs wall.
[4797.34 - 4801.26] P:1571.36 E:0.098570 |  One huge stand behind the goal that Vicario is defending.
[4801.26 - 4804.78] P:1471.28 E:0.086054 |  Spence wins it back for Spurs with the help of Bergwald.
[4804.78 - 4807.98] P:1598.92 E:0.107185 |  Unlucky enough to get a goal in the first half, Bergwald he thought he'd scored,
[4807.98 - 4812.22] P:1539.56 E:0.097961 |  but five and a half minutes later a VAR check ruled it out for offside.
[4812.22 - 4814.86] P:1609.17 E:0.097013 |  Romero, judge to have just been off.
[4815.58 - 4819.66] P:1377.17 E:0.103198 |  And as Solanke can't hold the ball up and keep
[4819.66 - 4822.62] P:1356.37 E:0.099777 |  Harwood Bellis off his back and the Saints have it again.
[4822.62 - 4824.46] P:1293.56 E:0.091099 |  With Manning down the left wing,
[4824.54 - 4827.58] P:1518.77 E:0.107463 |  looks for an option and looks for a bit of support and finds it in a Rebo.
[4827.58 - 4831.50] P:1490.66 E:0.097172 |  Square across the middle of the Tottenham half to Uggachukwu now with
[4831.50 - 4834.78] P:1399.17 E:0.093981 |  Walker Peters and out to the right wing for Tyler Dibbling.
[4834.78 - 4838.94] P:1698.83 E:0.105596 |  Being watched closely by Spence, he's tricky with those low slung socks.
[4838.94 - 4841.42] P:1446.58 E:0.104619 |  And Walker Peters attempts to find Fernandez,
[4841.42 - 4843.26] P:1381.59 E:0.104746 |  but it's well cut out by the Spurs defence.
[4843.26 - 4845.18] P:1513.41 E:0.099486 |  They have it back with James Madison,
[4845.18 - 4848.54] P:1493.03 E:0.117006 |  who dances the other side of the referee and skips away from a Rebo.
[4848.54 - 4850.22] P:1636.48 E:0.120710 |  And looks for Sun Hyeong-min,
[4850.22 - 4853.34] P:1482.85 E:0.120462 |  who's racing into open green space down the left.
[4853.34 - 4856.22] P:1552.14 E:0.109111 |  Hits it, left footed, great recovering challenge
[4856.22 - 4859.10] P:1529.11 E:0.112826 |  from the Southampton skipper, Jan Bednarek,
[4859.10 - 4860.94] P:1521.53 E:0.106531 |  who's hurt himself in the process,
[4860.94 - 4865.82] P:1571.59 E:0.101866 |  but a crucial tackle if to not make this scoreline even worse from their perspective.
[4865.82 - 4867.90] P:1180.37 E:0.121488 |  Yeah, great break from Tottenham into Madison.
[4868.46 - 4871.26] P:1522.62 E:0.116187 |  Again, heads on a swivel, finds a wonderful ball into Sun.
[4871.26 - 4874.06] P:1348.02 E:0.098569 |  And he just feels Sun in the form he's been,
[4874.06 - 4877.34] P:1609.12 E:0.108664 |  the season's gone past, that he will take that touch and score that chance.
[4877.34 - 4878.94] P:1747.65 E:0.106113 |  He just lingers a little bit,
[4878.94 - 4881.82] P:1608.50 E:0.099774 |  let's Bednarek to come back in, make that sliding challenge,
[4881.90 - 4884.22] P:1444.89 E:0.104275 |  and he doesn't get the shot away as he would have liked.
[4884.22 - 4887.74] P:1502.46 E:0.106612 |  Dibbling has it again on the edge of the Spurs penalty area, down the right side.
[4887.74 - 4889.98] P:1311.80 E:0.112473 |  He rolls it under his studs on his left boot
[4889.98 - 4893.26] P:1455.54 E:0.094504 |  and looks for support in the form of Kyle Walker-Peters,
[4893.26 - 4897.10] P:1327.53 E:0.114607 |  one to play with Uggachukru and back out towards Dibbling again on the right wing.
[4897.10 - 4901.66] P:1482.48 E:0.103220 |  We've played nearly 54 minutes here under the blue sky of North London.
[4901.66 - 4905.26] P:1593.77 E:0.104792 |  That wasn't the best bit of play from the teenage Dibbling though,
[4905.26 - 4907.02] P:1466.44 E:0.086224 |  as he tried to find Walker-Peters,
[4907.02 - 4909.90] P:1521.08 E:0.110891 |  but instead gave it straight back to another teenager in Bergwald,
[4909.90 - 4913.26] P:1433.57 E:0.100874 |  but he's now had his pocket picked and Southampton have it again,
[4913.26 - 4917.34] P:1562.48 E:0.114013 |  ball to the edge of the penalty area, Romero read it really well
[4917.34 - 4921.82] P:1599.93 E:0.105155 |  and stepped forwards out of defence and found a short ball to Solanke,
[4921.82 - 4923.74] P:1570.37 E:0.115803 |  who likewise has done well.
[4923.74 - 4927.02] P:1626.87 E:0.125458 |  It's now Romero who's the furthest player forward for Spurs,
[4927.02 - 4929.34] P:1584.06 E:0.107406 |  he's going to fall over the ball at this rate,
[4929.34 - 4931.74] P:1523.42 E:0.119361 |  eventually throws himself to the ground
[4931.74 - 4934.38] P:1544.73 E:0.115799 |  in the hope that the referee will give him a free kick,
[4934.38 - 4937.34] P:1466.34 E:0.109128 |  but instead that was a good old-fashioned case of a defender
[4937.34 - 4939.58] P:1430.28 E:0.114994 |  getting a nosebleed when he got too far up the pitch.
[4940.62 - 4942.62] P:1560.51 E:0.115507 |  The referee, when he gets the ball to Solanke,
[4942.62 - 4945.34] P:1505.59 E:0.112002 |  he does ever so well on the right-hand side
[4945.34 - 4947.34] P:1416.30 E:0.116570 |  to keep the ball away from Harrod Bellas,
[4947.34 - 4950.14] P:1538.30 E:0.095027 |  drive down back into Romero's feet,
[4950.14 - 4951.50] P:1586.75 E:0.117801 |  little nutmeg from Romero,
[4951.50 - 4954.14] P:1025.80 E:0.116784 |  and then he just dives on the ground because he knows he has no support.
[4955.58 - 4958.86] P:1287.90 E:0.100840 |  Manning has it back for Southampton down the left,
[4958.86 - 4963.10] P:1492.00 E:0.099260 |  the shadow over the top of this beautiful playing surface
[4963.10 - 4966.70] P:1530.09 E:0.110791 |  is gradually increasing, not so much sunlight out there now,
[4966.78 - 4970.46] P:1453.98 E:0.112033 |  as Manning, left-footed, tries to find a cross into the penalty area
[4970.46 - 4974.22] P:1346.25 E:0.105318 |  and instead blazes it behind into the wall behind that goal,
[4974.22 - 4975.90] P:1526.50 E:0.107082 |  it'll be a Spurs goal kick.
[4977.02 - 4979.98] P:1460.59 E:0.109564 |  Yeah, Manning, first time there, he has to cross that,
[4979.98 - 4982.46] P:1326.28 E:0.111924 |  as it comes out to him, he's in a really good position,
[4982.46 - 4985.34] P:1446.29 E:0.112679 |  just to whip his foot around and put it behind the top of the defenders,
[4985.34 - 4987.98] P:1442.24 E:0.108308 |  but instead he opts to try and take a touch and fires over,
[4987.98 - 4991.02] P:1530.47 E:0.097195 |  and that's what Southampton, when they get into the final third as well,
[4991.02 - 4993.58] P:1401.10 E:0.103038 |  that lack of just know-how or quality,
[4993.58 - 4995.18] P:1079.08 E:0.117420 |  just to put the ball into the right area.
[4997.50 - 5002.94] P:1425.29 E:0.109987 |  I think I just spied Papp Sarr getting changed to enter the fray here in the second half,
[5002.94 - 5006.46] P:1395.93 E:0.104512 |  or certainly Ad Legs, of course, his introduction on Thursday evening
[5006.46 - 5010.38] P:1380.15 E:0.106394 |  at Stamford Bridge was booed by the travelling Spurs supporters.
[5010.38 - 5014.22] P:1127.62 E:0.113356 |  Bergvall was taken off at that point, and then Sarr came on and scored the goal,
[5014.22 - 5017.26] P:1248.46 E:0.093154 |  and of course that was disallowed six minutes later,
[5018.06 - 5022.78] P:1275.86 E:0.111504 |  as Southampton have it again, once more attacking this Spurs penalty area,
[5022.78 - 5024.62] P:1166.70 E:0.116197 |  onto the left wing low ball from a Rebo,
[5025.34 - 5028.06] P:1441.29 E:0.112943 |  is cut out by Davies before it could reach Archer,
[5028.06 - 5031.98] P:1438.36 E:0.107302 |  and Spurs played amongst themselves at the back with plenty of composure,
[5031.98 - 5035.02] P:1350.43 E:0.111332 |  before Bergvall lifts it in the air up to the halfway line,
[5035.02 - 5037.50] P:1620.72 E:0.096651 |  it drops just inside Southampton territory,
[5037.50 - 5040.46] P:1490.92 E:0.110090 |  and Bednarek has the strength advantage over Solanke,
[5041.26 - 5044.06] P:1505.64 E:0.111803 |  it'll be a free kick for the Saints,
[5044.06 - 5048.38] P:1389.64 E:0.101102 |  just inside the Spurs half to the right of the centre circle,
[5048.38 - 5052.06] P:1480.83 E:0.104684 |  and it'll be a double change here for Ange-Postakoglu's side.
[5052.62 - 5055.98] P:1607.76 E:0.111139 |  Son Hyeong-min is the first to be withdrawn,
[5055.98 - 5061.98] P:1510.63 E:0.111327 |  and he'll be replaced by Wilson Odebe, the other change down there is Pappymatter Sarr,
[5061.98 - 5068.14] P:1570.10 E:0.108359 |  who's ready to come on too, and he will replace Rodrigo Bentonkirk,
[5068.14 - 5071.26] P:1592.72 E:0.118327 |  clearly with Thursday evenings Europa League quarter-final against
[5071.26 - 5073.02] P:1552.74 E:0.107072 |  Stamford in mind, Stephen Kelly.
[5073.02 - 5075.34] P:1530.15 E:0.126909 |  Yeah, absolutely, and Bentonkirk scored a second half,
[5075.34 - 5079.10] P:1626.56 E:0.115843 |  he's made some great challenges in the box, travelling around, getting on the ball,
[5079.10 - 5082.06] P:1594.54 E:0.109049 |  Son, after that run forward where he felt he was going to score,
[5082.06 - 5085.58] P:1453.72 E:0.104380 |  you think that's when you get him off now, you get his legs rested,
[5085.58 - 5087.02] P:1284.57 E:0.113497 |  he could have played a really important role,
[5087.02 - 5090.22] P:1272.96 E:0.106272 |  and Odebe, you know, he's missed a lot of the season so far,
[5090.22 - 5092.78] P:1510.38 E:0.122937 |  and I think in the moments I've seen him, he can be a real trend,
[5092.78 - 5095.66] P:1438.25 E:0.105732 |  I think he could cause problems for Stamford on this left-hand side,
[5095.66 - 5097.98] P:1475.27 E:0.102667 |  with his pace and his ingenuity,
[5097.98 - 5099.66] P:1292.20 E:0.110233 |  and Sarr is going to go in the middle of the park,
[5099.66 - 5101.42] P:1494.94 E:0.097574 |  and give their energy that they're going to need,
[5101.42 - 5102.62] P:1454.27 E:0.112838 |  they've been lacking the second half.
[5103.42 - 5107.66] P:1500.61 E:0.105558 |  Still 2-0 to Tottenham here as we approach the hour mark in North London,
[5107.90 - 5110.06] P:1638.21 E:0.104281 |  still 3-1 to Fulham against Liverpool,
[5110.06 - 5112.38] P:1593.53 E:0.101838 |  0-0 between Brentford and Chelsea,
[5112.38 - 5114.54] P:1651.44 E:0.109366 |  4-30 on BBC Radio 5 Live,
[5114.54 - 5117.58] P:1429.08 E:0.097934 |  it's the Manchester Derby with the United against City Live,
[5117.58 - 5119.50] P:1634.22 E:0.102370 |  from Old Trafford on Tuesday,
[5119.50 - 5121.98] P:1755.06 E:0.100197 |  Champions League football returns full commentary,
[5121.98 - 5124.86] P:1595.10 E:0.100830 |  on 5 Live of Arsenal against Real Madrid,
[5124.86 - 5128.70] P:1548.69 E:0.091660 |  there is also commentary on 5 Sports Extra of England Women
[5128.70 - 5130.38] P:1468.40 E:0.095516 |  at Belgium in the Nations League,
[5130.38 - 5132.22] P:1393.68 E:0.116317 |  on Wednesday it's Sastan Ville's turn,
[5132.22 - 5135.66] P:1612.20 E:0.097842 |  and there'll be live commentary of their trip to Paris to face PSG
[5135.66 - 5137.82] P:1398.20 E:0.103764 |  in the last eight of the Champions League,
[5137.82 - 5139.82] P:1520.63 E:0.105362 |  and then of course on Thursday evening,
[5139.82 - 5142.30] P:1540.61 E:0.106338 |  that is when Spurs will welcome Frankfurt here,
[5142.30 - 5146.46] P:1455.43 E:0.105591 |  we'll have updates into the Lyon Manchester United commentary
[5146.46 - 5148.38] P:1239.99 E:0.119352 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live,
[5148.38 - 5151.34] P:1681.78 E:0.106529 |  so the first couple of changes there for Rangiposter Cogler,
[5151.34 - 5154.62] P:1537.93 E:0.109188 |  as he's starting to turn his attention to more pressing matters,
[5154.62 - 5158.22] P:1335.71 E:0.108879 |  that will ultimately dictate how this season is reflected upon,
[5158.22 - 5163.50] P:1528.90 E:0.104624 |  should Spurs be able to finally capture a bit of silverware,
[5163.50 - 5165.42] P:1532.03 E:0.102839 |  that they still have Rashalison,
[5165.42 - 5168.62] P:1426.57 E:0.098717 |  the returning Rashalison on the substitutes bench,
[5168.62 - 5170.78] P:1485.39 E:0.099904 |  should they want to introduce him this afternoon?
[5170.78 - 5176.14] P:1047.78 E:0.119307 |  Charlie, I would say 100% that Salanki will be coming off 65-70 minutes,
[5176.14 - 5177.82] P:1079.03 E:0.109256 |  because he's put a shift in.
[5177.82 - 5181.42] P:1193.23 E:0.118760 |  Yeah, he's battled away against the big Benton Courage there as well,
[5181.42 - 5182.62] P:1489.50 E:0.113036 |  as he's just been withdrawn,
[5182.62 - 5184.86] P:1562.68 E:0.107017 |  and Suleyman is balling to the penalty area,
[5184.86 - 5187.50] P:1519.29 E:0.110724 |  he's not the best, yeah, he's battled away against Bednarec,
[5187.50 - 5189.58] P:1473.98 E:0.118172 |  the same Benton Courage being replaced too,
[5189.58 - 5191.66] P:1511.61 E:0.093343 |  and they're trying to save legs now,
[5191.66 - 5194.06] P:1521.48 E:0.115137 |  you wonder if Madison will soon be withdrawn as well,
[5194.06 - 5196.62] P:1196.72 E:0.083968 |  or maybe a Ramero at the back?
[5196.62 - 5202.06] P:1163.74 E:0.102144 |  Yeah, for me, Salanki's the one that's probably expelled the most amount of energy,
[5202.06 - 5203.82] P:1187.78 E:0.123020 |  he's been everywhere really,
[5203.82 - 5204.62] P:1684.97 E:0.108734 |  trying to put pressure,
[5204.62 - 5207.50] P:1473.94 E:0.102666 |  he's leading from the front when it comes to pressing the ball,
[5207.50 - 5211.02] P:1244.77 E:0.098447 |  trying to be that pivotal person that receives it as well,
[5211.66 - 5212.54] P:1503.81 E:0.093131 |  getting knocked about,
[5212.54 - 5216.54] P:1494.04 E:0.100064 |  and you feel Gera-Charleson on for 20 minutes could be really important.
[5217.42 - 5219.90] P:1360.52 E:0.115381 |  Sort of afternoon where he grab a goal as well, isn't it?
[5219.90 - 5224.14] P:1404.41 E:0.094993 |  Sunshine in Southampton, have it once more on the left wing,
[5224.14 - 5225.82] P:1452.82 E:0.116059 |  Matias Fernandez on the ball,
[5225.82 - 5228.38] P:1503.62 E:0.089695 |  he smashes it from left to right,
[5228.38 - 5231.10] P:1537.45 E:0.105537 |  drops at the feet of Kyle Walker-Peters awkwardly,
[5231.10 - 5233.42] P:1500.56 E:0.112606 |  and Otterbeer will nick it away from him,
[5233.42 - 5235.02] P:1492.67 E:0.110859 |  cross the halfway line down the left,
[5235.02 - 5237.98] P:1553.00 E:0.113610 |  and find James Madison in a pocket of space as per usual.
[5237.98 - 5240.22] P:1634.24 E:0.108857 |  Now Brennan Johnson, who let's not forget is on a hat-trick,
[5240.22 - 5242.14] P:1533.46 E:0.113525 |  tries to stab it in the direction of Salanki,
[5242.78 - 5245.34] P:1414.06 E:0.117935 |  rocketed back at Ramsdale by Harwood Bellis,
[5245.34 - 5248.06] P:1504.05 E:0.102681 |  who does well, plenty of composure back there,
[5248.06 - 5250.54] P:1446.97 E:0.115202 |  from the Southampton keeper to play it out,
[5250.54 - 5252.70] P:1555.02 E:0.101233 |  and they'll now have themselves a free kick,
[5252.70 - 5256.22] P:1406.74 E:0.106829 |  and it might be a yellow card it is for Pedro Polo.
[5256.22 - 5258.22] P:1172.84 E:0.130484 |  I'll tell you what, Ramsdale did really well there,
[5258.22 - 5261.02] P:1379.10 E:0.094204 |  because Harwood Bellis fired at him from what?
[5261.02 - 5262.14] P:1262.20 E:0.115421 |  Four or five yards away?
[5262.78 - 5266.86] P:1568.67 E:0.098865 |  He just left foot, just beautiful little touch at the left-hand side,
[5267.42 - 5268.94] P:1510.15 E:0.111344 |  cuts out Salanki's press,
[5269.58 - 5271.26] P:1091.68 E:0.114334 |  and then lets him get away with a book.
[5271.26 - 5274.22] P:1489.52 E:0.101466 |  It was under severe pressure there to make sure that touch was perfect.
[5274.78 - 5277.82] P:1386.49 E:0.109222 |  They made it look really easy when it had every opportunity
[5277.82 - 5278.70] P:1487.95 E:0.105908 |  to wrong foot him.
[5278.70 - 5281.50] P:1316.23 E:0.102426 |  He's going to be a Premier League footballer again next year, isn't he?
[5281.50 - 5283.58] P:1369.10 E:0.114275 |  You would think so, but you just don't know.
[5284.70 - 5287.74] P:1267.79 E:0.116684 |  The question marks over Ramsdale are not going to be whether he's a good goalkeeper.
[5287.74 - 5290.22] P:1401.45 E:0.109983 |  It's going to be, why did you choose to go to Southampton?
[5290.22 - 5291.66] P:1125.99 E:0.123120 |  Is that the level you feel you're at?
[5291.66 - 5292.14] P:1103.14 E:0.111884 |  I don't know.
[5292.70 - 5295.34] P:1294.89 E:0.106197 |  I didn't understand it, because I think for most people,
[5295.34 - 5297.10] P:987.62 E:0.118034 |  listen, obviously, Hounsoy is a wonderful team,
[5297.10 - 5301.34] P:1281.23 E:0.105898 |  for most people would have had Southampton within their tree of going down.
[5301.98 - 5306.78] P:1168.11 E:0.115421 |  For Ramsdale, who was on the cusp of winning a Premier League a few years ago,
[5308.46 - 5312.22] P:1237.08 E:0.117684 |  yes indeed, Matias Fernandez for Southampton on the right wing,
[5312.22 - 5313.98] P:1546.38 E:0.108885 |  fakes to cross it onto his left foot.
[5314.86 - 5317.90] P:1654.27 E:0.118282 |  Pulsar trigger from range, blocked by James Madison, gets back up again,
[5317.90 - 5319.66] P:1639.92 E:0.114762 |  looked through a 1-2 with Walker-Peters.
[5319.66 - 5323.26] P:1553.67 E:0.105433 |  Spence gets there first, and will win inside a free kick.
[5323.26 - 5326.62] P:1483.87 E:0.097291 |  Walker-Peters looks at the assistant and says,
[5326.62 - 5328.94] P:1672.49 E:0.116252 |  no, you've got that one wrong, it should have been a corner kick,
[5328.94 - 5331.02] P:1594.96 E:0.091215 |  but it is a free kick instead.
[5331.02 - 5336.14] P:1642.20 E:0.102344 |  Even Eurich, the Southampton manager, has just gone across to a couple of these substitutes
[5336.22 - 5340.78] P:1416.63 E:0.097702 |  and told them to come back in the direction of the technical area.
[5340.78 - 5343.90] P:1628.92 E:0.107201 |  He's clearly of making, thinking of making a few changes now,
[5343.90 - 5348.22] P:1566.71 E:0.102452 |  as they stare the trapdoor into the EFL right in the face.
[5348.22 - 5353.66] P:1479.28 E:0.093407 |  They've got less than half an hour to just simply delay their relegation.
[5353.66 - 5359.34] P:1418.94 E:0.095382 |  They will become the fastest team to ever be relegated to the championship.
[5360.54 - 5363.82] P:1584.54 E:0.117306 |  In match week 31, this is the previous record,
[5363.90 - 5368.54] P:1450.55 E:0.108321 |  with six games left, it's held by Derby County and Huddersfield Town.
[5369.82 - 5375.98] P:1480.51 E:0.096649 |  Today, they would become the team with the earliest relegation on record from the top flight.
[5375.98 - 5381.26] P:1366.20 E:0.096629 |  They still need another couple of points to surpass Derby County's record
[5381.26 - 5383.74] P:1532.79 E:0.102797 |  as the worst team in Premier League history.
[5383.74 - 5388.62] P:1441.83 E:0.106137 |  They're on 10 points, Derby were relegated in 2008 with just 11.
[5389.42 - 5393.42] P:1396.28 E:0.100214 |  Meanwhile on the pitch, Spurs have got themselves a free kick inside the centre
[5393.50 - 5398.94] P:1330.62 E:0.099023 |  circle and just inside the Southampton half, 62 minutes are on the clock,
[5398.94 - 5404.46] P:1499.17 E:0.103776 |  still 2-0 here, 3-1 to Fulham against Liverpool and 0-0 between Brentford and Chelsea.
[5406.06 - 5412.22] P:1354.68 E:0.103537 |  To Romero, who stood over the ball, had a couple of headers brilliantly saved by Ramsdale in the
[5412.22 - 5417.58] P:1489.30 E:0.107622 |  first half, both of them flying, diving headers, sort of stuff that you love to put in when you're a kid.
[5418.62 - 5421.98] P:1443.37 E:0.103646 |  Madison tries to turn away from Ogachuk, where it's blocked by the Southampton
[5422.86 - 5426.30] P:1433.54 E:0.103563 |  midfielder and it comes back off of Bergval and it'll be a Southampton throw.
[5426.30 - 5430.54] P:1322.24 E:0.102297 |  Fred Bergval, I don't know whether he didn't see it or didn't think he could execute,
[5430.54 - 5433.50] P:1265.46 E:0.114191 |  but Spence had made a run in behind there and he was in.
[5433.50 - 5438.62] P:1370.91 E:0.108984 |  He was absolutely in, no one attract him and Bergval just didn't get his head up on time to find that pass.
[5440.06 - 5443.74] P:1516.54 E:0.115519 |  There's usually a number of goals between these two sides when they do meet.
[5443.74 - 5449.02] P:1532.24 E:0.103926 |  Spurs won 5-0 at Southampton in December, that proved to be Russell Martin's final game before
[5449.02 - 5456.06] P:1499.16 E:0.087444 |  he was sacked. 5-0 was also the fifth time that Spurs have scored at least five against the Saints,
[5456.06 - 5460.62] P:1490.68 E:0.094409 |  which is the most between any Premier League clubs currently in the top division.
[5461.34 - 5467.58] P:1385.17 E:0.100923 |  Johnson finds Saar inside the Spurs half in the sunshine on that far side as they kick from right
[5467.58 - 5472.62] P:1318.92 E:0.105773 |  to left. Saar trying to cut through the middle of the Southampton midfield and attack their defense,
[5472.62 - 5478.30] P:1383.45 E:0.102483 |  but a strong recovering tackle made by a Rebo sees Southampton back in possession once more.
[5478.30 - 5483.26] P:1565.80 E:0.105192 |  Two players stripped and ready to come on on the near touchline for the visitors, James Brie.
[5483.26 - 5487.18] P:1466.98 E:0.122379 |  I think it appears to be one of them down there, where Smallbone is another one.
[5487.74 - 5488.62] P:1253.52 E:0.115773 |  As Wellington, is it?
[5488.62 - 5491.66] P:1458.29 E:0.120351 |  Yeah, Wellington, Smallbone down there.
[5494.78 - 5501.02] P:1456.06 E:0.108839 |  It will be a Rebo who's withdrawn for Southampton with Smallbone returning from injury
[5501.74 - 5508.78] P:1308.09 E:0.099651 |  and that other change, the Brazilian Wellington coming on to replace Ryan Manning,
[5508.78 - 5510.94] P:1484.15 E:0.105283 |  so a straight swap for both of those positions.
[5512.30 - 5517.98] P:1432.98 E:0.108297 |  And is it? What Southampton's interesting is when you look at their kind of fun five-ish or a
[5517.98 - 5524.22] P:1495.82 E:0.103043 |  fun training in two homerfielders, like the age, you know, Dibbling's nine is 19, Archer's 23,
[5524.22 - 5530.70] P:1332.69 E:0.106922 |  Sulamana's 23, Hugo Trucquas 21, Fernandez is 20, you know, have a Rebo off, he's in here.
[5530.78 - 5534.94] P:1549.86 E:0.118487 |  Yeah, Solanki gets the other side briefly of Bednarek, the Southampton defenders getting back,
[5534.94 - 5540.22] P:1684.10 E:0.116715 |  trying to recover another brilliant save from Ramsdale. Solanki does really well and now Ramsdale
[5540.22 - 5547.18] P:1530.08 E:0.111677 |  spilled the ball on the edge of the box and that might well be handball. It is as he slid to try
[5547.18 - 5553.02] P:1590.17 E:0.116549 |  and keep a hold of the ball with Solanki there, he slid out of his 18-yard box and the free kick
[5553.02 - 5558.22] P:1547.89 E:0.116517 |  has been given. Ramsdale makes a brilliant stop initially and then as he legs it along his
[5558.22 - 5564.70] P:1532.97 E:0.110298 |  byline to try and keep a hold of the ball before Solanki could get there, he slid, tried to grab it,
[5564.70 - 5571.18] P:1333.16 E:0.101340 |  but in doing so has left his penalty area. Yeah, Solanki, middle of the pitch, ball over the top,
[5571.18 - 5576.54] P:1478.66 E:0.112323 |  takes it down, has time to turn, still get a shot away, Ramsdale pulls off a wonderful save down
[5576.54 - 5581.98] P:1540.03 E:0.111728 |  to his left hand side and then he's scrambling out and Solanki can see that he's going at such speed,
[5581.98 - 5586.14] P:1372.95 E:0.109726 |  he's going right towards it as your box, gets his hands in the ball and acts and ends up just
[5586.14 - 5591.18] P:1346.82 E:0.103637 |  sliding out with the ball in his handbook. It's a wonderful stop from him, but again, defensively
[5591.18 - 5595.50] P:1343.24 E:0.114676 |  so poor from Southampton, Solanki should not be able to bring it down there, then turn and get the
[5595.50 - 5600.38] P:1426.21 E:0.112160 |  shot away. It takes him a while to get under control. We've played 20 minutes in the second half and
[5600.38 - 5605.66] P:1453.36 E:0.105136 |  Southampton have been much improved on their first half performance. You think if a goal was to come
[5605.66 - 5610.94] P:1494.64 E:0.104533 |  for them, they might well get themselves back into this game, but another goal for Spurs would
[5610.94 - 5615.74] P:1415.56 E:0.107329 |  surely put this game and their status in the Premier League to bed. Ball curled in, so what's the
[5615.82 - 5620.22] P:1512.65 E:0.097793 |  back post in the direction of Romero, but flicked away before it could reach him. It's out with
[5620.22 - 5627.50] P:1436.88 E:0.104801 |  Wilson Otterbeer who's closed down by Wellington and that'll be a Spurs throwing around 15 yards or
[5627.50 - 5633.50] P:1266.28 E:0.092377 |  so up the touchline from the corner flag away to our left hand side. Spence finds Bergvall
[5634.22 - 5639.10] P:1355.71 E:0.110499 |  and back into the heart of the defence for Davis once more. A reminder if you just joined us on
[5639.10 - 5645.58] P:1480.43 E:0.107887 |  BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, Southampton will be relegated if they lose as they are doing here
[5645.90 - 5651.26] P:1406.00 E:0.109755 |  in North London this afternoon. It's game week 31. It would be a new record for the fastest ever
[5651.26 - 5657.18] P:1333.68 E:0.091288 |  relegation. This is Spence in the top flight, I should add. I've not looked in the EFL for those.
[5657.98 - 5663.66] P:1431.27 E:0.106093 |  Back to Vicario and Vicario will find Romero and Postacoglu stood on the edge of his technical
[5663.66 - 5669.82] P:1174.91 E:0.099599 |  area. He'll be a relieved man that things so far have been going swimming. Yeah, Tottenham are not
[5669.82 - 5674.70] P:1320.66 E:0.107939 |  being great the second half. They've nowhere near kept possession the way they should have already
[5674.70 - 5680.46] P:1348.76 E:0.098363 |  done the first half and you expect to show something. Tottenham started again to the groove
[5680.46 - 5684.62] P:1499.00 E:0.105947 |  now slightly and I expect to be maybe one or two more changes from the Spurs side.
[5685.50 - 5691.58] P:1379.23 E:0.082810 |  They've conceded possession and Smallbone has it for Southampton in his bright pink kit. Back to
[5691.58 - 5698.62] P:1379.28 E:0.097831 |  Kyle Walker-Peters. Still 3-1 to Fulham against Liverpool as Fernandez takes over now for Southampton.
[5698.62 - 5703.02] P:1553.49 E:0.114603 |  Back to Smallbone inside the penalty area. Pokes it in the general direction but actually nowhere
[5703.02 - 5709.58] P:1398.75 E:0.104128 |  near Cameron Archer and Spurs will clear it away once more out as far as Taylor Harwood-Bellis.
[5710.14 - 5718.14] P:1345.70 E:0.103353 |  More football to come later on BBC Radio 5 live the Manchester Derby at 4.30. John Murray and Leon Osmond
[5718.86 - 5724.86] P:1496.65 E:0.101956 |  will bring you that one as Uggachukru has it again and Fernandez has gone down off the ball
[5724.86 - 5728.62] P:1492.45 E:0.106288 |  and the referee has blown his whistle. Stop the game and it'll be a free kick for the Saints around
[5728.62 - 5735.50] P:1289.76 E:0.090402 |  three or four yards outside of the Spurs penalty area. I think he looked to play the 1-2 and saw
[5735.50 - 5741.02] P:1501.36 E:0.096418 |  his his run blocked off the ball after he'd played it Fernandez by Madison and I think Madison knew
[5741.02 - 5745.34] P:1425.15 E:0.101340 |  exactly what he was doing. Hasn't been booked just yet but might be doing well to avoid one.
[5745.34 - 5750.62] P:1350.94 E:0.101267 |  Yeah he just steps right across and there's no contact to the face. I can see Fernandez is down
[5750.62 - 5754.38] P:1383.30 E:0.109575 |  holding, rolling around holding his face but now he's about to step up and take his free kick
[5754.46 - 5759.18] P:1305.75 E:0.109537 |  perfectly able and Madison is just a body check. Just steps in this path, stops his run,
[5759.18 - 5763.26] P:1211.91 E:0.110804 |  not that he was going to get on the end of it. Fernandez gives the ball a kiss for good luck
[5763.26 - 5769.18] P:1258.62 E:0.110665 |  before he finally places it. It's five yards outside of the penalty area tucked in on the inside right
[5769.18 - 5775.58] P:1483.35 E:0.096215 |  channel. Right footed, floated ball edge of the six yard box headed away and out to the far wing
[5775.58 - 5780.70] P:1440.30 E:0.107739 |  by Dominic Solanke. Spence will find Sar and Spurs are looking to counterattack. Otterbeers
[5780.70 - 5785.26] P:1463.99 E:0.106329 |  made a run through the middle instead. They'll try to find Brennan Johnson down the right. Wellington
[5785.26 - 5791.50] P:1575.74 E:0.095836 |  has matched him stride for stride and poked it out inadvertently for a Spurs throwing just inside
[5791.50 - 5796.62] P:1320.74 E:0.110054 |  of the Southampton. It's a poor pass from Sar. Well as he comes inside all the space to aim for
[5796.62 - 5800.86] P:1546.70 E:0.102169 |  him behind Wellington but he just rolls it short not giving Brennan Johnson the opportunity to
[5800.86 - 5805.34] P:1479.09 E:0.104285 |  really open his legs up and get behind. And he had far better options as well through the central
[5805.34 - 5809.34] P:1451.55 E:0.109107 |  areas of the pitch and out to the left too. The Johnson one was almost the decoy one. That's not
[5809.34 - 5815.58] P:1349.23 E:0.092451 |  the one you play to pass the. Spurs fans haven't been given a great deal to smile about here at home
[5816.22 - 5821.58] P:1306.92 E:0.105220 |  in recent weeks. You can say recent months really they've won just one of their last 10 Premier League
[5821.58 - 5827.90] P:1399.48 E:0.098346 |  games here in North London. They're on their way to two in 11 now. When they approach the end of
[5827.90 - 5835.58] P:1443.36 E:0.091843 |  this Premier League season with a lot of important games as they try to avoid one of the worst finishes
[5835.58 - 5842.54] P:1408.25 E:0.093712 |  that they've seen in the top flight. They've not finished outside of the top 10 for 17 years but
[5842.54 - 5847.98] P:1487.54 E:0.102972 |  they will do as things stand. Their worst ever finish in the Premier League was 15th back in
[5847.98 - 5854.38] P:1265.77 E:0.093661 |  1994 and they started the day 16th in the Premier League. That won't be where they end their day
[5854.38 - 5861.26] P:1295.91 E:0.085834 |  though as things stand at the moment though Southampton will be relegated as we approach the 70th
[5861.26 - 5867.26] P:1279.29 E:0.096512 |  minute. It's still spurs to Southampton. Neil was Madison unhelpfully dinks a ball up in the air
[5867.26 - 5871.66] P:1476.63 E:0.104644 |  back in the direction of Romero controls it comfortably enough and you wonder Stephen Kelly
[5871.66 - 5876.38] P:1348.77 E:0.107047 |  whether or not the the start that Southampton made to this second half where they had all that
[5876.94 - 5881.98] P:1533.03 E:0.105804 |  energy behind them and they were firmly on top for maybe the first 15 to 20 minutes or so has
[5881.98 - 5887.58] P:1372.24 E:0.106134 |  just started to dwindle away. Yeah it's petered out. They they they got on top Tottenham gave them
[5887.58 - 5892.14] P:1426.53 E:0.106626 |  some really good opportunities to go and win the ball high up in the Tottenham half and then try
[5892.14 - 5896.94] P:1468.03 E:0.105889 |  and attack them and they didn't really take advantage of we looked at the opportunities they had to
[5896.94 - 5902.30] P:1295.88 E:0.097235 |  put decent balls in the box put crosses in or make the right decision in the passing but they just
[5902.30 - 5908.46] P:1301.95 E:0.097622 |  didn't do that and now they seem to just drop back into that old form of getting men behind the ball
[5908.46 - 5912.78] P:1332.68 E:0.088049 |  and waiting for Tottenham to do something. Spence gets away from a couple of Southampton players
[5912.78 - 5917.82] P:1318.80 E:0.105383 |  the ball ricochets into the path of Saar. They'll play it back to Porro dead centre 10 yards outside
[5917.82 - 5923.26] P:1519.71 E:0.107444 |  of the Southampton penalty area now Brennan Johnson's ball drops just in behind Dominic Salanke falls
[5923.26 - 5929.66] P:1470.43 E:0.094000 |  into the feet of Kyle Walker Peters and he'll try to find the ball out to Fernandez but it's been
[5929.66 - 5935.10] P:1584.82 E:0.113138 |  brilliantly read by Virgval who slides and recovers possession for Tottenham. It's with Otterbeer now
[5935.10 - 5940.22] P:1468.40 E:0.101319 |  near the byline edge of the box and Matthias Fernandez will try to bring it away. Virgval
[5940.22 - 5944.22] P:1579.07 E:0.109091 |  there once more works really hard the teenager but he won't be able to catch Dibbling this time
[5944.22 - 5948.62] P:1536.81 E:0.106245 |  who gets up towards the halfway line plays a one-two with Archer and then we'll find a ball
[5948.62 - 5954.22] P:1422.86 E:0.090531 |  out to that left touch line for Wellington and now it's hardwood Bellis who has it once more for
[5954.22 - 5959.82] P:1361.38 E:0.098038 |  Southampton inside the final 20 minutes here now at the Tottenham-Hotspur Stadium. Walker Peters again
[5959.82 - 5966.22] P:1409.34 E:0.086546 |  on the right wing Otterbeer coming back and closes him down Madison will force Dibbling back up
[5966.22 - 5971.74] P:1403.06 E:0.095950 |  towards Bednereck and he'll play it square across the back line for Harwood Bellis. He reads the
[5971.74 - 5975.90] P:1447.45 E:0.110947 |  game really well Virgval doesn't it he's snuffed it out the danger time and time and time again
[5975.90 - 5979.74] P:1419.17 E:0.107868 |  throughout the day but there is a bit of danger here but there's Virgval involved again along with
[5979.74 - 5983.82] P:1507.87 E:0.105920 |  Jeds Benson two of them there have really impressed this afternoon as they have done over the last
[5983.82 - 5988.46] P:1427.13 E:0.096932 |  few months these have been a tough few months for Tottenham for the players but those are a couple
[5988.46 - 5993.66] P:1497.75 E:0.100640 |  of players that have really stood out. I think you're probably looking at one and two for players
[5993.74 - 5998.22] P:1343.50 E:0.105325 |  this season for Tottenham realistically throughout the course of the year and they've come in by default
[5998.22 - 6003.50] P:1247.48 E:0.105282 |  as well you would never have had those two as starters or being as instrumental they have done.
[6003.50 - 6008.54] P:1308.55 E:0.103763 |  Spence was out in the cold he looked like he was going to get no opportunity here and has found
[6008.54 - 6013.58] P:1358.24 E:0.104737 |  his way in that's been brilliant throughout the season and Virgval again 19 year old not coming
[6013.58 - 6018.38] P:1312.55 E:0.102516 |  expecting to start especially in the midfield with Sarbasuma and Benton Curran looking like they had
[6018.38 - 6023.42] P:1432.21 E:0.109891 |  that secured him I think he's been excellent the energy to industry and then he shows a bit of
[6023.42 - 6030.22] P:1385.30 E:0.094560 |  goiling cleverness in the forward areas as well. A couple more changes for Southampton as Cameron
[6030.22 - 6037.42] P:1479.80 E:0.107894 |  Archer and Tyler Dibbling have both been replaced Sugawara and Paul Onoachu coming on now Onoachu
[6037.42 - 6043.34] P:1446.56 E:0.097374 |  is very much their kind of if in emergency break glass type thing this afternoon because he injured
[6043.34 - 6049.50] P:1550.12 E:0.108282 |  his ankle against Crystal Palace in the week he scored he scored two in his last two and he is a
[6049.50 - 6054.54] P:1195.75 E:0.096940 |  real handful all six foot seven of him. Yeah he is and you're going to bring him on bring him on
[6054.54 - 6059.42] P:1382.33 E:0.094988 |  when you're free kick you can fling into the box. That will be the plan no guesses to see who
[6059.42 - 6063.82] P:1585.80 E:0.115150 |  perhaps might be a target in the end they try to play it out towards the far side of the 18-yard
[6063.82 - 6068.70] P:1451.49 E:0.106562 |  box but it's easily dealt with by Spence who comes away with it and then he's held up by
[6068.70 - 6073.58] P:1625.82 E:0.111663 |  Bednarak and Sugawara but he's done really well gone down won the free kick his manager
[6073.58 - 6077.98] P:1541.86 E:0.107482 |  Ange Posterkoglu is stood directly over the top of them at the moment and very warmly
[6077.98 - 6082.30] P:1439.65 E:0.099183 |  applauded the effort there of Jed Spence. Yeah good play Spence gets held up and you just see
[6082.30 - 6087.90] P:1483.07 E:0.099957 |  just dink the ball between the two players is it about to drive on and gets brought down.
[6090.94 - 6094.38] P:1599.34 E:0.113327 |  Sugawara was one of those players who's just come off the bench and one of the first things he did
[6094.86 - 6100.30] P:1304.21 E:0.091113 |  is bring Spence down and he's been linked with a move to Napoli in the summer. I don't think there's
[6100.30 - 6105.50] P:1445.71 E:0.095966 |  much thought that he will be playing in the championship for the club. This will be his 30th
[6105.50 - 6111.66] P:1395.04 E:0.096126 |  appearance of the season the Japanese international and as for Kario finds Davis and Davis will find
[6111.66 - 6117.34] P:1415.08 E:0.099391 |  Madison at the back one two with Spence but Ogachukwu's blocked the run of Madison similar to
[6117.34 - 6121.98] P:1489.38 E:0.098108 |  how Madison did to Fernandez about five minutes or so ago and that'll be a free kick for Spurs
[6122.78 - 6129.42] P:1446.58 E:0.091015 |  and Ange Posterkoglu stands hands in his black overcoated pockets and we've already mentioned
[6129.42 - 6133.98] P:1483.57 E:0.103191 |  Stephen Kelly will be thinking about the Thursday night to come against Antrek Frankfurt might
[6133.98 - 6139.66] P:1545.49 E:0.102456 |  also be thinking about the VAR goal that was disallowed from Lucas Bergwaltz offside in the
[6139.66 - 6144.54] P:1495.86 E:0.101609 |  first half too it could be far more comfortable than the two goal scoreline that it is but that
[6144.54 - 6149.98] P:1245.16 E:0.092993 |  is very much the Tottenham Hartsburg. So surprised he hasn't taken Tlanky off I feel like he's
[6150.54 - 6155.18] P:1581.96 E:0.099121 |  he's done everything he can this game he's run the channels he's pressed he's you know he's been
[6155.18 - 6160.22] P:1393.59 E:0.107884 |  a tough battle with the two centre backs who've been like bumbling from behind making tackles
[6160.22 - 6164.86] P:1379.14 E:0.095711 |  he's been physical and then you feel if you have if for Charleston is going to have an impact there
[6164.86 - 6168.54] P:1570.23 E:0.113131 |  going to be a player that you can potentially use on Thursday you want to get a few minutes in his
[6168.54 - 6175.42] P:1493.44 E:0.084730 |  leg today and it just looks like there's no sign of him making that change. Charleston is one of
[6175.42 - 6180.54] P:1479.83 E:0.093630 |  five Spurs substitutes that are out warming up away to our left hand side in fact in Charleston
[6180.54 - 6184.94] P:1491.80 E:0.106242 |  his bleach blonde hair very recognisable even from this distance he's warming up on the pitch at the
[6184.94 - 6189.90] P:1557.29 E:0.102114 |  moment as play takes place around 60 yards away from him with Bednarak who tries to find Walker
[6189.90 - 6195.42] P:1454.11 E:0.105034 |  Peters on the near touch line with a left-footed ball that in the end goes way beyond him and out
[6195.42 - 6201.98] P:1484.29 E:0.099931 |  for a throw in we've played 75 minutes it's still 2-0 to Tottenham Hartsburg they will go up to
[6202.06 - 6208.06] P:1514.15 E:0.097309 |  13th in the Premier League table as things stand on 37 points five behind Brentford
[6208.06 - 6214.38] P:1498.30 E:0.099018 |  who are currently on 42 Brentford playing at home this afternoon to Chelsea still 0-0 there
[6214.38 - 6219.90] P:1501.84 E:0.095084 |  Liverpool meanwhile have got a goal back at Craven Cottage Lewis Diaz with that it's now Fulham 3
[6220.54 - 6224.38] P:1319.75 E:0.112587 |  Liverpool 2 you wouldn't put it past them Steven Kelly to go and get an equaliser all
[6224.38 - 6229.26] P:1484.92 E:0.100911 |  more there would you. Now not the way they've been this season Fulham did so well they got back
[6229.26 - 6234.62] P:1535.07 E:0.107978 |  into that didn't they. Yeah 1-0 down in that game Fulham turned it round 3-1 up it's now 3-2 there
[6234.62 - 6240.54] P:1292.30 E:0.097952 |  and you can listen to it live on BBC Radio 5 live Tottenham Hartsburg very comfortably seeing this
[6240.54 - 6247.26] P:1263.94 E:0.099969 |  game out under the blue skies of north London this is Sugawara on the right wing has the number 16
[6247.26 - 6252.06] P:1369.37 E:0.103787 |  on his back now Fernandez all of this about 10 yards outside of the Tottenham Hartsburg penalty
[6252.06 - 6257.66] P:1441.22 E:0.086611 |  area Walker Peters back to Sugawara lots of space to pick out a right-footed cross and he's put it
[6257.74 - 6263.34] P:1539.75 E:0.102517 |  over everyone but it will run all the way through to Camelden Sulamana hits it first time blocked by
[6263.34 - 6268.86] P:1556.86 E:0.096989 |  Brennan Johnson the score of both of those Spurs goals this afternoon and Porro turns it forwards
[6268.86 - 6273.98] P:1640.70 E:0.109710 |  in the direction of Solanki goes down once a free kick looks at the referee arm stretched out wide
[6273.98 - 6278.78] P:1485.83 E:0.099773 |  but the referee completely ignores him now a right-footed ball from Sulamana in the direction
[6278.78 - 6285.02] P:1547.52 E:0.111085 |  of Onoaciu, Vicario comes and again leaps high into the sky and catches it with both hands.
[6285.66 - 6289.98] P:1364.64 E:0.109939 |  Yeah good play from Vicario comes out and just takes the sting out of game completely
[6291.42 - 6293.98] P:1489.31 E:0.127004 |  but again I'm looking at Tottenham thinking who they're going to bring a substitute it looks
[6293.98 - 6299.82] P:1381.13 E:0.099134 |  like they have Archie Gray lined up potentially to come on now and Basuma. So that's Romero maybe
[6299.82 - 6306.78] P:1279.58 E:0.085690 |  centre-back and Basuma goes into the middle. Maybe for James Madison just to rest some legs there
[6307.02 - 6315.18] P:1276.27 E:0.089785 |  Spurs have made two subs so far this afternoon withdrawing Benton Kerr and Sun with Thursday
[6315.18 - 6321.66] P:1243.19 E:0.100611 |  evening in mind so Vicario is closed down by Smallbone away to our right Spurs kicking from
[6321.66 - 6327.90] P:1399.48 E:0.099993 |  right to left in Navy Blue and White this afternoon Southampton in pink shirts and shorts with
[6330.06 - 6335.42] P:1436.93 E:0.113698 |  Paul Onoaciu leading the line since he came on a few moments ago and scored two in his last
[6335.42 - 6340.70] P:1339.73 E:0.102791 |  two games four goals overall this season he's 30 years old he's six foot seven
[6342.06 - 6347.82] P:1321.37 E:0.097895 |  thanks Ben Davis takes the ball off of Vicario and then immediately gives him back again.
[6348.46 - 6353.74] P:1397.86 E:0.104065 |  Is it too simple Stephen Kelly from a Tottenham Spurs perspective to say that the season does
[6353.74 - 6357.74] P:1152.90 E:0.109944 |  live and die on what they do in the Europa League quarterfinals and more widely in that
[6357.74 - 6362.14] P:1372.25 E:0.108803 |  competition this season we'll come back to that because Sulamana now herring towards the Spurs
[6362.14 - 6367.26] P:1585.50 E:0.113849 |  penalty area hits one draws the save out of Vicario clawed away and then in the direction of
[6367.26 - 6372.06] P:1559.55 E:0.118852 |  Uggachukwu he throws himself at the ball but it's nothing but thin air and Spurs will look to
[6372.06 - 6378.06] P:1625.68 E:0.107352 |  counter attack in the opposite direction Sulanky's down off the ball Bergval has it finds Papsar
[6378.06 - 6382.38] P:1521.36 E:0.113274 |  and now it's with Odebër down the left he's not really got anybody with him so he'll put his foot
[6382.38 - 6388.06] P:1454.37 E:0.100767 |  on it and wait for Sa to be introduced Sulanky slowly gets back up again with an almighty limp
[6388.06 - 6395.26] P:1468.27 E:0.111265 |  as Bergval wonderfully picks out Porro 30 yards out he'll hit one well over the top of the crossbar
[6395.26 - 6401.26] P:1343.60 E:0.099129 |  and it'll be a goal king yeah I'm looking at Sulanky honestly it's about four or five times
[6401.26 - 6404.78] P:1299.63 E:0.107469 |  that either Harrow Bellas have been there because come right through the back of Sulanky
[6407.26 - 6411.02] P:1449.37 E:0.126317 |  as if you're the Spurs manager watching this game surely you can see the same thing we're
[6411.02 - 6415.42] P:1597.04 E:0.117131 |  seeing and you're thinking he's just said the forward he's the one you're going to start
[6415.42 - 6420.86] P:1665.07 E:0.114697 |  on to Rizal I would expect he's the one that leads the line he was heavily involved in the
[6420.86 - 6424.70] P:1442.72 E:0.117470 |  first half of the press and the way they go better I think Tottenham have missed him when he hasn't
[6424.70 - 6430.46] P:1640.34 E:0.112447 |  played and you're on the silly wrist by leaving him on the pitch just get him off and get someone
[6430.46 - 6434.54] P:1514.33 E:0.121237 |  else on that can play and Madison's the one that comes off RSU Gray Bergval comes off of
[6434.54 - 6439.42] P:1517.85 E:0.102913 |  Basu Man you think that's tactical but practically I'll be I'll be getting Sanky off the pitch
[6439.74 - 6445.02] P:1567.97 E:0.089097 |  yeah they've still got one substitution left they've made four now just to confirm those for you
[6445.02 - 6452.22] P:1403.83 E:0.095238 |  Madison and Bergval off as Basu and Gray have replaced them back to that question but I was
[6452.22 - 6457.66] P:1527.15 E:0.094771 |  going to say a few moments ago before Sulamana stung the palms of Vicario is it too simple to say
[6457.66 - 6462.54] P:1316.27 E:0.109057 |  that the season is all about that it is all about that I think I think that's it it can be as simple
[6462.54 - 6468.54] P:1165.03 E:0.100290 |  as that sometimes things can pivot on one thing and for Spurs that's this is everything to
[6469.42 - 6475.90] P:1323.81 E:0.089419 |  them they've been let's face it for Tottenham standards over the last 10 years or so well most
[6475.90 - 6479.34] P:1129.40 E:0.103604 |  of the time in the Premier League this has been an awful season for them when it comes to where
[6479.34 - 6483.50] P:1387.87 E:0.102612 |  they're going to finish they're nowhere near getting European space outtrue league position
[6483.50 - 6488.38] P:1160.00 E:0.106289 |  they're nowhere near domestic cup they have one team left this season which is to try and win
[6488.38 - 6493.10] P:1151.72 E:0.105036 |  silverware in Europa League which would be a phenomenal thing for them to do what they lost
[6493.74 - 6498.22] P:1204.88 E:0.099386 |  but yeah is that possible yes but they're going to have to play better than they do today because
[6498.22 - 6502.38] P:1028.25 E:0.109139 |  I don't think the Southampton team are a very good side and Spurs have dropped off and allowed them
[6502.38 - 6507.90] P:1428.38 E:0.091118 |  into it at times massively so in the second half though Southampton still have nothing to show for
[6507.90 - 6512.54] P:1497.22 E:0.101725 |  it and we're now inside the final 10 minutes of the game Southampton will be relegated at the
[6512.54 - 6518.54] P:1637.39 E:0.103257 |  conclusion of this if they lose 2-0 down here is Fernandez sneak little ball into Sugawara but he
[6518.54 - 6524.62] P:1429.89 E:0.108577 |  can't take it any stride inside the 18-yard box goes down and maybe once a penalty he's never
[6524.62 - 6530.38] P:1469.84 E:0.104842 |  going to get one the referee stopped the game just to make sure that the Japanese winger is okay
[6530.38 - 6537.58] P:1335.22 E:0.097610 |  gets a pat on the back from Ben Davis and being told to get up really from from all quarters
[6537.58 - 6544.38] P:1229.84 E:0.089665 |  catch a little bit of a replay there there's very little in that and the game will resume
[6544.38 - 6549.26] P:1336.97 E:0.111080 |  in a moment certainly not with a penalty but I'd say you know never speak too soon with VAR but
[6550.06 - 6555.10] P:1337.21 E:0.108192 |  if completely innocuous yes now it's the ball gets stuck behind them and Spence as checks as
[6555.10 - 6560.62] P:1104.49 E:0.118756 |  Ron comes back and I think what happens is as he goes down Spence as he turns and kind of knees
[6560.62 - 6565.82] P:1119.01 E:0.114954 |  him in the calf slightly and so it can be painful but it's not going to result in landing apart from
[6566.78 - 6572.46] P:1340.77 E:0.105103 |  the throw in which Kyle Walker Peters is stood over at the moment has the ball in his left hands
[6572.46 - 6578.54] P:1455.29 E:0.108784 |  Sugawara is just retrying his right boot full and still leading by three goals to two against
[6578.54 - 6582.70] P:1413.17 E:0.105572 |  Liverpool still goalless between Brentford and Chelsea we've got great week in front of us
[6583.34 - 6589.10] P:1480.90 E:0.111702 |  on BBC Radio 5 live a couple of Champions League commentaries for you and a Europa League commentary
[6589.10 - 6594.06] P:1527.98 E:0.112895 |  as well Champions League on Tuesday and Wednesday Europa League on Thursday and we also start our
[6594.06 - 6601.82] P:1434.50 E:0.098081 |  coverage live from Augusta for the first golfing major of the year Rory McElroy again trying to
[6601.82 - 6608.06] P:1383.22 E:0.105580 |  win that career Grand Slam Scotty Sheffler likely to be the man to beat Walker Peters right footed
[6608.06 - 6614.30] P:1397.42 E:0.091321 |  ball off the right wing finds small bone back to Sugawara 82 minutes have been played small
[6614.30 - 6622.06] P:1252.98 E:0.090777 |  bone picks it up again and finds Ogre Chukwuk every single Southampton player apart from Ramsdale
[6622.06 - 6629.18] P:1299.11 E:0.089998 |  inside the Spurs half at the moment Ogre Chukwuk finds Sugawara on the right wing Fernandez was
[6629.18 - 6634.38] P:1500.23 E:0.105139 |  an option but instead it's the left-footed ball that somehow manages to go over the head of the
[6634.38 - 6639.58] P:1550.20 E:0.106484 |  giant Onowachu and behind for a goal kick in if ever a passage of play summed up Southampton's
[6639.58 - 6644.14] P:1224.67 E:0.114210 |  afternoon and indeed season that was it yeah that was it and I think that's kind of summed up this
[6644.14 - 6650.70] P:1365.47 E:0.120217 |  second half of the match it's been pretty forgettable just to say at least Nita team has really caused
[6650.70 - 6656.54] P:1388.69 E:0.099735 |  many problems Nita team has looked good in possession going forward attacking there's just
[6656.54 - 6661.98] P:1234.73 E:0.111883 |  been a real lack of anything in the second half first half was easy but I said before the game
[6661.98 - 6667.90] P:1387.27 E:0.104577 |  that this fixture kind of looked like it was potentially going to be a preseason friendly
[6667.90 - 6672.22] P:1236.61 E:0.121640 |  and this second half is basically being a preseason friendly Nita team really wanting to exert
[6672.22 - 6678.46] P:1268.16 E:0.088322 |  themselves too much and yeah going through the motions almost Stephen Kelly when you're right
[6678.46 - 6683.82] P:1458.09 E:0.100944 |  you're right and you are right Southampton have made another change and if they're clinging to
[6683.82 - 6688.38] P:1500.11 E:0.104806 |  straws and clutching at them here as well something to maybe smile about from a Southampton
[6688.38 - 6693.90] P:1548.63 E:0.097820 |  perspective Ross Stewart has returned from yet another injury my goodness is that man
[6693.90 - 6698.94] P:1577.24 E:0.108691 |  unlucky he's replaced Leslie Ogachukwu and Ross Stewart is back in a matchday squad for the first
[6698.94 - 6703.98] P:1566.96 E:0.113035 |  time since October and here come Spurs it's with Salanki edge of the penalty area to put the gloss
[6703.98 - 6711.26] P:1438.74 E:0.109124 |  on this left-footed blazes high and wide and over and then behind to the awaiting Spurs fans it's
[6711.26 - 6715.82] P:1276.18 E:0.107235 |  still 2-0 to Tottenham Hotspur we're about to see the 84th minute takeover it's a good pass from
[6715.90 - 6721.10] P:1463.66 E:0.109166 |  basuma into his feet and Salanki takes it really well drops onto his left foot but then Bednarek
[6721.10 - 6726.30] P:1367.33 E:0.117108 |  I think defends this really well gets out leans into him just urges him shuffles him away from
[6726.30 - 6731.02] P:1340.27 E:0.107722 |  the goal slightly and then when he hits the ball he's leaning back and forwards it way over the left
[6731.02 - 6735.82] P:1338.03 E:0.102705 |  hand side and you can tell as Bednar came across he wasn't going to make it Salanki's nicked it here
[6735.82 - 6739.82] P:1499.26 E:0.120202 |  he's got it again he's approaching the edge of that Southampton penalty area and Bednarek has
[6740.38 - 6747.10] P:1482.09 E:0.105436 |  made the challenge snuffs out another Spurs attack we've got another Tottenham change on the way
[6747.10 - 6753.10] P:1350.11 E:0.104024 |  Mattias Tell is ready to come on maybe for Dominic Salanki time will tell yeah six minutes he's
[6753.10 - 6759.10] P:1201.91 E:0.097872 |  trying to save his legs listen he's had a chance to score there but I am surprised this didn't
[6759.10 - 6762.94] P:1427.56 E:0.107539 |  happen earlier in the match yeah I am too and as you've mentioned on a couple of occasions he's
[6763.58 - 6768.70] P:1444.03 E:0.111495 |  he's worked hard and bundles will small bone to the ground dishing out a bit of the treatment
[6768.86 - 6774.46] P:1369.43 E:0.100520 |  that he's received from Harwood Bellis in Bednarek all afternoon yeah they they fair Bednarek and
[6774.46 - 6779.58] P:1071.29 E:0.100855 |  Harrod Bellis when the balls being in the box and Cross have come in I think and organising
[6779.58 - 6782.62] P:967.52 E:0.116370 |  defensively they're great but when the balls been playing in Salanki's feet they've been right up on
[6782.62 - 6788.78] P:1245.13 E:0.102468 |  Tottenham nipping ass heels you know making some some quite fiery tackles on them from behind and
[6788.78 - 6794.14] P:1429.04 E:0.109266 |  he's taken it taking a fair few hits on Anki into the final five minutes here on BBC Radio 5 sports
[6794.22 - 6798.94] P:1442.79 E:0.107032 |  extra that Steven Kelly the former Spurs Birmingham Reading fullback of course with the Republic of
[6798.94 - 6804.86] P:1483.71 E:0.110657 |  Ireland as well Spurs still leading by those two Brennan Johnson goals to know both of them coming
[6805.50 - 6811.90] P:1480.34 E:0.094439 |  in the first half the first after 13 minutes the second four minutes before the break in between
[6813.18 - 6820.70] P:1299.07 E:0.093739 |  they thought they'd got another through Bergwald only for it to be disallowed by VAR for offside it
[6820.70 - 6827.66] P:1165.23 E:0.098895 |  took well over five minutes to come to that decision as the Pesuma has it for Spurs plays a
[6827.66 - 6833.58] P:1379.57 E:0.112164 |  one-two with Otterberg gets it back again right in the heart of the pitch as the Spurs fans burst
[6833.58 - 6840.06] P:1271.31 E:0.104517 |  into song and Brennan Johnson in that small area of pitch which is still bathed in beautiful
[6840.06 - 6845.58] P:1266.79 E:0.107444 |  north London sunshine takes over gives it to Poro Poro trying to play the one-two in behind
[6845.58 - 6850.86] P:1490.99 E:0.106442 |  down the inside right channel and instead it goes behind for a Southampton goal kick and there
[6850.86 - 6854.62] P:1689.69 E:0.122978 |  is that change and he'll be as you mentioned Steven Kelly really grateful Dominic Solanke
[6854.62 - 6858.70] P:1401.53 E:0.117501 |  of the four minutes of rest yeah and pass the car you're looking after centre forward there for
[6858.70 - 6863.18] P:1608.95 E:0.115646 |  the big game on Thursday night he put a shift in you have to give it to him he's worked really hard
[6863.18 - 6868.14] P:1493.87 E:0.111577 |  I think Solanke you know he stays fit for the full season I think Tottenham Tottenham season
[6868.14 - 6872.54] P:1222.70 E:0.118560 |  would be slightly different than what it is because he leads the line really well he presses
[6872.62 - 6876.94] P:1048.40 E:0.126030 |  really well he gets the rest of the team up the pitch and he's taken a fair few kicks today so
[6877.66 - 6882.14] P:1172.27 E:0.104528 |  yeah get them off I suppose never too little too late it's a four five-minute rest point
[6882.14 - 6887.34] P:1408.57 E:0.105473 |  I guess from Dominic Solanke and Sposter Kogalu's perspective they were hoping that he got a goal
[6887.34 - 6891.98] P:1298.59 E:0.108924 |  he's not scored now in I think any of his last nine Premier League games Solanke and you know
[6891.98 - 6896.30] P:1378.49 E:0.109201 |  strikers they they feed on it they live off the confidence of goal scoring and I suppose if there's
[6896.30 - 6899.66] P:1261.18 E:0.112184 |  a team you're on it you would think you're going to have a chance to get a goal it's going to be
[6899.74 - 6907.02] P:1231.71 E:0.095765 |  Southampton but honestly I think the second half if the best way to describe second half is just meh
[6907.02 - 6911.50] P:1348.49 E:0.112024 |  if it meant emoji would describe the second half of the game in an instance there's been no
[6912.06 - 6918.14] P:1400.64 E:0.105601 |  no nothing of note almost as Sulamana now picks it up for Southampton switches it from left to right
[6918.14 - 6923.10] P:1576.15 E:0.103624 |  and finds Sugawara inside the right corner of the penalty area now hits it draws a good save
[6923.10 - 6927.18] P:1641.08 E:0.118920 |  out of the car that's a really good save probably probably the best save that he's made all game
[6927.18 - 6932.46] P:1583.69 E:0.105917 |  because it might well take a slightest of flicks on the way through diving down to his right hand
[6932.46 - 6936.62] P:1416.92 E:0.109265 |  side makes a good stop snuffs out the danger and grabs the ball as well yeah that's the best moment
[6936.62 - 6942.70] P:1395.78 E:0.101497 |  of second half Southampton work well and as he as he gets this he just drops his shoulder to the left
[6942.70 - 6946.62] P:1451.54 E:0.099121 |  creates a little bit of space and then he hits it with no real back lift but there's there's a
[6946.62 - 6951.42] P:1324.80 E:0.111885 |  tremendous bit of power on this and Vicario has to do well to get down quickly and knock this out
[6952.30 - 6955.50] P:1428.14 E:0.118240 |  make sure he doesn't knock it into Southampton body as well so it was a really good save from
[6955.50 - 6961.66] P:1409.19 E:0.109418 |  Vicario really well hit we're into the 89th minute here in north London as Porro spins away from
[6961.66 - 6967.34] P:1498.82 E:0.107699 |  Sulamana and then draws the attention of Smallbone they play it in triangles between Porro and
[6968.54 - 6975.10] P:1444.47 E:0.105485 |  Sarr and Johnson now with Archie Gray who signed last summer from Leeds United such a promising
[6975.10 - 6980.06] P:1597.04 E:0.105549 |  young footballer I watched a lot of him last season in the championship with Leeds he just lets the
[6980.46 - 6985.26] P:1483.48 E:0.110443 |  ball run by him so composed on the edge of his home penalty area he of course comes from
[6985.90 - 6990.46] P:1765.49 E:0.105450 |  fairly good stock son of Andy grandson of Frank great nephew of Eddie Gray
[6991.02 - 6997.58] P:1356.33 E:0.106877 |  as Mattias Tell leads the line charging down the press on Aaron Ramstale who played into the
[6997.58 - 7002.06] P:1425.74 E:0.102287 |  heart of the defense and Southampton will build again down the left it's nice to see Gray you know
[7002.06 - 7007.02] P:1325.00 E:0.096974 |  in the position where I would expect him to play for Tottenham he's playing that the whole limit
[7007.02 - 7011.02] P:1480.25 E:0.095066 |  field role which I feel if he gets given the opportunity to play that could be really pivotal
[7011.02 - 7016.86] P:1438.81 E:0.084542 |  for Spurs and unfortunately he's being deployed out right back centre back left back this season
[7016.86 - 7021.50] P:1314.13 E:0.108192 |  all through Tottenham's injury crisis and he quit himself really well for a teenager
[7021.50 - 7025.34] P:1301.72 E:0.107507 |  but that position he's in now is the one where you feel if he gets game time in there could really
[7025.34 - 7030.14] P:1201.21 E:0.104007 |  make a difference think of him and Bergwald a couple of years could be brilliant yeah both of them
[7030.14 - 7035.34] P:1698.75 E:0.119466 |  only 19 Sulamana has it for Southampton dinked ball towards the back post Fernandez controls it
[7035.34 - 7042.70] P:1465.96 E:0.110026 |  and fires home through the legs of the cario Southampton have themselves a goal back inside
[7042.70 - 7051.50] P:1358.86 E:0.102914 |  the final minute of the game it is Spurs 2 Southampton 1 yeah great finish from Fernandez but
[7051.50 - 7056.14] P:1390.39 E:0.121380 |  the time he has to bring that down like the cross comes in I'm thinking head of first time he does
[7056.14 - 7059.82] P:1376.19 E:0.116925 |  it he ups the chest down I think Gray he's bringing it down he's not going to get an
[7059.82 - 7066.06] P:1410.96 E:0.102507 |  opportunity to get this shot away but he does he has time to bring it down take his time fire
[7066.06 - 7070.70] P:1280.80 E:0.113302 |  between for Cario's legs with no one from Tottenham really getting back to him Spence has got drawn
[7070.70 - 7078.06] P:1345.58 E:0.097989 |  inside because I think the centre forward has peeled off the shoulder of Davies but the time he
[7078.06 - 7081.66] P:1320.78 E:0.118036 |  has to take this down and hit it and listen I know it's the last moment in the game but Tottenham
[7082.38 - 7086.70] P:1201.94 E:0.119692 |  getting poor defended every goal here is a vital ball I know most goals are but in this game today
[7087.26 - 7092.30] P:1429.65 E:0.111557 |  every goal has been a vital ball it was chat briefly for offside the goal stands we're into
[7092.30 - 7099.34] P:1605.55 E:0.106871 |  four minutes of stoppage time at the end of the game it is Spurs 2 Southampton 1 and as things stand
[7099.34 - 7106.22] P:1489.42 E:0.108410 |  they will still be relegated today they have to avoid defeat and some gallows humor from some of
[7106.22 - 7111.18] P:1437.76 E:0.114681 |  the Spurs fans drenched in sunlight in the far left corner away from us chanting that they're
[7111.18 - 7116.46] P:1579.13 E:0.113422 |  staying up they know they're not doing they're just trying to avoid going down in record breakingly
[7116.46 - 7122.30] P:1541.19 E:0.109773 |  quick fashion which they are still doing so if they lose this game there is a roar from those
[7122.30 - 7126.54] P:1510.17 E:0.101570 |  Southampton supporters on the far side of the ground though and from nothing in this second
[7126.54 - 7132.06] P:1619.68 E:0.101263 |  I've mentioned it at length really Steven Kelly there have been very very few chances for either
[7132.06 - 7137.02] P:1437.48 E:0.101936 |  side now Southampton have got the wind in their sails yeah they really do and you feel with
[7137.02 - 7141.82] P:1409.95 E:0.112461 |  the size advantage they have in the centre forward positions now they need to hit the ball in the
[7141.82 - 7146.62] P:1475.94 E:0.109931 |  box they need to get it in the early and they need to turn their cross as well but they're giving
[7146.62 - 7152.14] P:1384.25 E:0.108959 |  the ball away here and allow Tottenham to regroup and probably put this down the pitch for Carrier
[7152.14 - 7157.42] P:1330.71 E:0.090707 |  it's going to get a long long free kick but Tottenham the second half it's just been it's been a
[7157.42 - 7161.58] P:1237.71 E:0.111239 |  really poor performance of Spurs it's been a poor performance of Southampton but Tottenham did not
[7161.58 - 7165.82] P:1309.86 E:0.111046 |  in any way the level of complacency I think they showed the second half is exactly what happened
[7165.82 - 7169.90] P:1238.70 E:0.104171 |  they thought they had the game you know dead to rights and haven't really turned up
[7170.86 - 7176.70] P:1596.09 E:0.110638 |  so Spurs 2 Southampton 1 it's finished at the GTEC community stadium Brentford Nill Chelsea Nill
[7176.70 - 7183.66] P:1284.27 E:0.111824 |  on the BBC Sport website it is still Fulham 3 Liverpool 2 they are hanging on on BBC Radio 5 Live
[7183.66 - 7188.62] P:1433.33 E:0.105529 |  where you can listen to the final few moments of that one they are leading by three goals to 2
[7188.62 - 7195.18] P:1398.25 E:0.110622 |  in the 97th minute still to come up 430 Manchester United against Manchester City also live on 5 Live
[7195.82 - 7201.82] P:1627.32 E:0.105710 |  Spence reads the danger snuffs it out as Walker Peters was trying to find a pass down that right
[7201.82 - 7206.62] P:1598.61 E:0.103522 |  wing in the direction of Sugawara who has helped since he's come on has added something a little
[7206.62 - 7211.10] P:1490.19 E:0.100140 |  bit different Fernandez has impressed as well since they made a couple of those changes he'll
[7211.10 - 7215.90] P:1515.90 E:0.096519 |  be thrilled with the goal but otherwise there's been very little to be impressed about when it
[7215.90 - 7222.14] P:1468.05 E:0.098558 |  comes to Southampton this afternoon four added on we've played two of those it's with Sulamana
[7222.14 - 7227.50] P:1459.60 E:0.106699 |  on the left wing again everybody for Southampton Bar the goalkeeper well inside Spurs territory
[7227.50 - 7231.82] P:1369.80 E:0.115802 |  having overload over in this right hand side with Sugawara and Walker Peters and that's exactly what
[7231.82 - 7236.38] P:1630.35 E:0.113807 |  they've tried to exploit now it's the touch of Sugawara that lets that down in the end otherwise
[7236.38 - 7240.94] P:1501.88 E:0.112693 |  they could well have been in yeah silver one against Jed Spence and just that touch gets away
[7240.94 - 7244.62] P:1270.11 E:0.106016 |  from but they're in a really good position there to try and cause Spurs a problem
[7246.22 - 7251.58] P:1613.53 E:0.109047 |  still going at Craven Cottage still 3-2 to Fulham against Liverpool long searching ball from
[7251.58 - 7256.86] P:1568.57 E:0.105547 |  left to right here meanwhile from Southampton has gone out for a Spurs throwing deep in their own
[7256.86 - 7263.90] P:1551.28 E:0.100325 |  territory in the left fullback position and very very slowly Jed Spence ambles over grabs the ball
[7263.90 - 7270.22] P:1653.15 E:0.096741 |  puts it under his arm Spurs will move up to 13th in the table should things stay like this should
[7270.22 - 7275.26] P:1455.05 E:0.102773 |  they be able to get out of here with all three points it's going to be another Spurs throwing
[7275.26 - 7280.30] P:1397.58 E:0.100672 |  on this near touch line Southampton thought they might have had one for a moment but instead Spurs
[7280.30 - 7286.22] P:1429.18 E:0.094746 |  will and once more we'll take their time over at Stephen Kelly yeah no rush of Spurs now just
[7286.22 - 7292.78] P:1508.34 E:0.094736 |  wind down the clock get a you want to say comfortable win to some extent in this game
[7292.78 - 7298.46] P:1532.70 E:0.097832 |  because Southampton haven't really showed much but the lack of goal scoring opportunities second
[7298.46 - 7303.66] P:1452.97 E:0.110289 |  avatar and has been what they've lacked Otterbeer has it dead center it got a three on three across
[7303.66 - 7308.38] P:1708.07 E:0.124352 |  towards Brennan Johnson goes down over the stretched leg of Wellington it's a penalty
[7308.94 - 7314.46] P:1654.28 E:0.118406 |  penalty for Tarnham Hotspurs of course it will be checked Wellington the substitute
[7315.34 - 7321.66] P:1564.54 E:0.112048 |  committed and Brennan Johnson whose honour hat trick went down and says please let me take it
[7322.46 - 7329.10] P:1601.06 E:0.108926 |  he's in discussion with Mattias Tell I believe on that far end of the pitch and it's an opportunity
[7329.10 - 7335.34] P:1420.29 E:0.102748 |  for Spurs to sew up the three points and put a nail in Southampton's coffin yeah it is it's
[7335.42 - 7340.22] P:1509.27 E:0.118814 |  to be fair as soon as Wellington goes in he puts his hands on his head I think that was
[7340.22 - 7345.18] P:1333.82 E:0.108659 |  Evan the referee it was a poor challenge no need to dive in there I think Brennan Johnson's gone
[7345.18 - 7349.42] P:1352.25 E:0.115154 |  away from play I don't think he's going to get on to the end of it either he's not happy about it
[7349.42 - 7355.18] P:1456.30 E:0.102979 |  either but it's Mattias Tell who stands over the ball and Johnson's almost being consoled I think
[7355.18 - 7359.66] P:1542.45 E:0.107401 |  by some of his teammates because he doesn't get to score the hat trick perhaps yeah but I
[7359.66 - 7365.26] P:1442.80 E:0.100488 |  yeah I want Johnson to get a hat trick be wonderful for a regular hat trick but if he's
[7365.26 - 7369.18] P:1424.18 E:0.113478 |  the penalty taker how many opportunities and many times we've seen this before where they get at
[7369.18 - 7376.06] P:1428.42 E:0.098948 |  and they miss well it's Mattias Tell against Aaron Ramsdale it's a goal that will finally put South
[7376.06 - 7386.30] P:1407.80 E:0.092855 |  Hampton out of their misery we played 95 minutes it's a direct straight run up from Tell he now
[7386.30 - 7394.06] P:1697.10 E:0.119545 |  wheels away stutter steps and scores and with that relegate Southampton to the championship
[7395.42 - 7405.10] P:1551.26 E:0.119436 |  in record breakingly quick fashion Spurs will return to winning ways in north London their first
[7405.10 - 7412.30] P:1601.32 E:0.103422 |  victory here since the middle of February in the Premier League but Southampton their fate finally
[7412.30 - 7419.50] P:1486.03 E:0.096916 |  confirmed it spurs three Southampton one yep and Tottenham getting a goal second half good penalty
[7419.50 - 7424.62] P:1613.48 E:0.112378 |  by Tell Ramsdale goes the right way gets it handled and actually I thought maybe he's going to save this
[7424.62 - 7429.02] P:1564.20 E:0.105550 |  just can't reach for another fan as good pace on the penalty in that far corner and
[7429.02 - 7432.94] P:1338.29 E:0.110998 |  yes and Tottenham you know if you give them for the first half for the better team deservedly to
[7432.94 - 7437.82] P:1538.96 E:0.103831 |  probably win this game create the most chances look the most dangerous but the second half
[7437.82 - 7442.06] P:1334.46 E:0.115312 |  neither side has really taken the game with a scuff in the neck and Southampton have gone out
[7442.06 - 7450.54] P:1511.06 E:0.094106 |  with a whimper really as we kind of expected well it's finished full on three Liverpool two so drama
[7450.54 - 7457.66] P:1562.78 E:0.093650 |  on the banks of the River Thames in the nation's capital there here this one's about to finish
[7457.66 - 7464.54] P:1543.98 E:0.114469 |  Tottenham three Southampton one the referee puts his whistle to his lips and that's it Spurs get
[7464.54 - 7472.62] P:1363.62 E:0.122491 |  all three points Southampton are relegated to the championship for a second time in three seasons
[7472.62 - 7479.42] P:1343.75 E:0.124182 |  the fastest team has ever been relegated from the Premier League it's finished Spurs three Southampton
[7479.42 - 7487.10] P:1114.06 E:0.120626 |  one Stephen Kelly yeah it's a it's a poor afternoon for Tenthampton they've gone down on record time
[7487.10 - 7492.06] P:1129.25 E:0.127011 |  no one would want that reputation they've got ten points they need to make sure they don't get the
[7492.06 - 7495.34] P:1317.70 E:0.119729 |  record of the least amount of points and if you have something to fight for that's something to
[7495.34 - 7500.38] P:1085.63 E:0.121449 |  fight for above in the first half they divide of confidence they've nothing about them at the moment
[7500.38 - 7505.58] P:1220.50 E:0.115569 |  and defensively the goals they gave away were so poor the lack of organization the discipline and
[7505.58 - 7509.26] P:1254.51 E:0.124511 |  the free kicks they gave away and this is not against a great Tottenham time at the moment
[7509.26 - 7514.78] P:1188.32 E:0.119538 |  Tottenham are not in a brilliant spell of playing wonderful football or electric they're a team that
[7514.78 - 7520.38] P:1121.86 E:0.125683 |  are not the most confident themselves so yeah not a great game to witness today but Tottenham get
[7520.38 - 7525.66] P:1197.45 E:0.122285 |  three points look forward to it you're open league on tour as Anta-Tampton unfortunately go down with
[7525.66 - 7530.14] P:1261.66 E:0.119945 |  that that woeful record of being the earliest team in the Premier League history to get relegated
[7530.14 - 7536.62] P:1411.02 E:0.116624 |  yeah those Southampton players currently gathering in the centre circles staring longingly into the
[7536.62 - 7541.66] P:1583.77 E:0.114877 |  distance in the general direction of the remaining Southampton supporters that have made the journey
[7541.66 - 7548.46] P:1320.88 E:0.116760 |  from the south coast today and have been bathed in sunlight all afternoon and in all fairness and
[7548.46 - 7554.78] P:1364.61 E:0.118507 |  credit to them the vast vast majority of the traveling thousands have stayed and are now
[7554.78 - 7561.90] P:1407.11 E:0.115322 |  applauding in the main those Southampton players as they slowly make their way across to them their
[7561.90 - 7571.18] P:1438.69 E:0.104942 |  fate has been sealed no side prior to today had ever been relegated with seven games still remaining
[7571.18 - 7576.86] P:1464.46 E:0.112517 |  two teams have gone down with six left Derby and Huddersfield but but never never quite so quickly
[7577.42 - 7582.70] P:1469.20 E:0.125376 |  Aaron Ramsdale leads the group over there he can be confident that he's done all he can certainly
[7582.70 - 7589.18] P:1441.85 E:0.112717 |  today this score line would have been far far worse but full credit to those Southampton fans who
[7589.18 - 7595.58] P:1345.64 E:0.117017 |  are singing at the top of their voices I think if anything can show you the value of fans and the
[7595.58 - 7600.38] P:1333.15 E:0.117919 |  importance of them to your club it's that right now they are literally singing chanting cheering
[7600.38 - 7606.14] P:1541.15 E:0.115184 |  to and they have every right to be angry every right to be disgruntled and giving their their
[7606.22 - 7610.22] P:1255.65 E:0.113478 |  their toughness into what what these fans said to have the team have done but they're celebrating
[7610.22 - 7615.26] P:1401.25 E:0.113694 |  them they're cheering them they're giving them you know it's amazing that this is this is remarkable
[7615.26 - 7619.02] P:1169.62 E:0.119892 |  to see that these fans are still here and cheering them and this is what football is about it's about
[7619.02 - 7625.18] P:1462.95 E:0.108504 |  those those right there Ramsdale has gone across and given his shirt to a young supporter at the
[7625.18 - 7630.94] P:1437.98 E:0.115406 |  other end of the field the Spurs fans are taking the applause of the remaining Tottenham Hotspur
[7630.94 - 7635.98] P:1320.26 E:0.121214 |  supporters there aren't that many left to be fair to them now but they'll be relieved to see a win here
[7636.14 - 7643.34] P:1421.21 E:0.112976 |  they've now won two of their 11 Premier League games in recent weeks it's been pretty miserable in
[7643.34 - 7649.18] P:1353.96 E:0.115111 |  north London for them but as the sunshine has returned so has that winning feeling so has the
