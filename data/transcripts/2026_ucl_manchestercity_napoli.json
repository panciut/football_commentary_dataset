Manchester City against Napoli to kick off their Champions League campaigns and it is a return to the elite European competition for Serie A champions Napoli who missed out last year. Manchester City, they might have been in the competition last year but it was really a year to forget as they crashed out in the pre last 16 playoff round. They are hoping for better this season but for the first time in a row they have been in the competition for the first time in a row. Manchester City has been in between two massive Premier League matches. The Derby successfully navigated on Sunday. This weekend they travelled to Arsenal so a few interested in what the team line up might be and I can tell you there are no changes from the starting 11 that started against Manchester United at the weekend. So Gianluigi Donnarumma the first time in a row. The team has a right back Abdukadir Kasanov, Rodri and Reinders in the midfield with Phil Ford in ahead of them. Jeremy Dockoo who had his two assists in the Derby on the left. Bernardo Silva on the right and Erling Halland who if he scores tonight will become the fastest to 50 goals in Champions League history. Michael Brown alongside me. Any surprise at all with that line up? I'm not sure if you can see that but what it is now with this change look and new back room staff is trying to find formula as a consistent Manchester City. They started really well in the first day. Then lacked in form conceding many opportunities against them not getting results. It was a shot with being a couple of injuries and those full back areas those mostly players like Nikko O'Reilly cushion off not necessarily set out to be in the next round. We will see Nikko O'Reilly's had more run in that area but now when the Champions League comes in the Arsenal game just around the corner it's going to be bigger tests along the way so stuck with it maybe the extra day of the rest in the middle of the week as well playing on a very strange night on a Thursday in the Champions League. I believe this is the only time that will happen but they've got to be on the front foot of the Champions League. They are in form. They have three wins out of three in the Serie A so far this season and they have some very familiar faces to the Premier League and for one particularly to this stadium. Kevin De Bruyne returns for the first time since moving to the Italian Champions. He's already scored twice in their opening three matches and they line up with Malinkovic Savic in goal. A back four of Leonardo Spinozola, and their captain Giovanni D'Lorenzo. Stanislaw Lobotka in front of them in that holding role. A midfield four in front of him of Scott MacTomany, Kevin De Bruyne, Frank Nguysa and Matteo Politano with Rasmus Hoiland who scored on his debut at the weekend leading the line up front. It is a little bit of a new look Napoli side this season still under Antonio Conti but he's moved away from some of his traditional principles no more back three for a start. How big a challenge is it to play with the players? What are the challenges that you're going to see in the post this evening? Big challenge because they're the ones in form. A wonderful record last season. Can they repeat it will see but they've found ways to win covered a few of their games so far. A formula still with new players. Lukaku was the big blow right on the start of the new season. So they'll fancy their chances tonight. They've got a lot of players in the team. They've got quite shorts and light blue socks playing from our left to right Napoli in their change kit of Navy shot shorts, Navy shirts and Navy socks. And it has been. Quite a good atmosphere in the build up to this one. I've noticed quite a few Kevin De Bruyne flags. I'm not sure if they've come from Napoli fans or from Manchester City fans, but he certainly had a warm welcome. And we've got a lot of players in the team. We've got a lot of players in the team. We talk about legends. We talk about top players and mistake that. Mistake that doesn't come to anything. It is hammered clear by Rodri and Helen will look to try and put some pressure on the defense at the back, but it's headed comfortably back to Malinkovic Savage in goal for them. He made his debut at the weekend against Fiorentina. He's been playing for the World Cup in Manchester on the Red half never made an appearance though as Napoli go direct looking for Hoyland, but it's headed clear by Diaz. And now Guardiola mops things up, puts his foot on the ball, looks for a teammate gets it back and it goes all the way back to Donnaruma, who has it at his feet, and it was a very interesting press conference from Donnaruma yesterday when he spoke ahead of this game about how he's making saves. I mean, he's a man mountain. Here he is now, he's rolling the ball out. A couple of short passes he's just waiting for the press, can he bounce it? Harlan's got a screen on. Can they go tight? He just wants to drop it in, one for one, you can't do that with Erling Harlan, he decides to go short. He does and now on this right-hand side, Koshanov, Manchester City just trying to build a little bit of possession. Now he's going to the right hand side. And now he's a little bit of Guardiola to drive into, crossing the halfway line, looking for options, waving his arms around. He doesn't have anything ahead, so he's come back to Diaz, but Manchester City now all in Napoli's half, just waiting for their moment. Defence, happy to hold onto the ball. And now Rodri has it, he almost went for the long ball in the last two years, but he's now in the final. And now he's going to play against Manchester United at the weekend. Now tries to play a little ball through to Harlan, it's cut out, but there is nobody up the pitch for Napoli, and again, Manchester City will come and this will be a very different test for Napoli. They won the championship on the final day, really dramatic end to the Serie A season, last season, and now they're going to play against the club, and they're going to be a challenge to the teams in Italy. Yeah, there being no rush, just let Manchester City, good position, wasn't it? Yosco Vardio in the centre of the pitch, that fullback coming to central midfield. He's the link. And it's out on the left-hand side with O'Reilly chops back onto his right foot, finds Dooku edge of the penalty area on the left foot, and then plays it out on the left foot, and then goes to the right foot. But there's a little bit of pressure here between Team Pett Guardiola, having a little word with that. Just step back for him, you can't get involved with shots like that from 30 yards. Stay where he is, Pett Guardiola in his suit tonight, with a little jumper on, sits back down. He's looking very smart. He always does. You know, only active manager in football right now who has played Pep Guardiola at least six times and has a better win rate than the Manchester City manager. So, could be an interesting tactical battle from the two in the dugout. Yeah, it could. Cushing off now, just setting up the throw in and it's near side. Both managers in the front of the technical area, you talk about battles, you talk about experienced winners, demands. These two don't get any more, do they? What they expect? Great turn from Doku. And Doku driving forward now right through the heart of Napoli's defence. He tries to find Halland, it's cut out but the referee is going to give a free kick in the edge of the area. Doku just catching Bakema, the Napoli centre half as he tried to drive forward. It was a really good break from the Belgian. Yeah, the pace was fantastic through the middle of the pitch. What was good is awareness. He knew the space and then he drives right through but his pass is poor. Then he makes a challenge. Is there much contact? Is it high? He's trying to get another little look here. Paul Otano. Yeah, it's just literally a little tap on the inside of his calf. He didn't really have any intent. The referee decides it's a free kick and can't really argue with it. The length of it, Savage takes it, plays it out short. To Kevin De Bruyne, who's got La Butka alongside him. Now Napoli come down the right-hand side with Dilarenzo. He's looking for the run forward but Kvarniol is there to knock it back to Donor. Amanda Pressure from Huyland gets it out to Diaz. And Diaz now to Koshanov, who played in that right back position at the weekend. And it was very impressive. Yeah, he was. He wasn't under too much pressure. He just stayed in his line. He didn't have too much to think about early on in his tenure as a right back. We're seeing obviously Rico Lewis go and join the midfield and stay in there. And then his timing. He did ever so well for a long period of time. But Kusanov now, it looks like he needs to defend first, is the message from Pep Guardiola. Yeah, Spinazzola, the Napoli left back. He will fly up and down that left-hand side all night long. He's got Scott McTominay, who sort of starts out in the left but drifts into a central area. Also will cause a few problems. I'm sure he's had such an incredible season last season after his move to Napoli from Manchester United. One that Antonio Conti said he didn't think would happen but was very glad it did. I'm sure Scott McTominay was as well because he was named the best midfielder in Serie A. Yeah, and he went back to Manchester United to have another look to see if he can find another one with Huyland. It's worked out well so far. Yeah, it has. And they're just waiting. Defensive line is trying to frustrate Manchester City, block, delay. De Bruyne, as you said, just had that touch stepping forward onto Ruben Diaz. And now Bernardo Silva, twisting, turning, looking for options. He's gone back to Diaz. Diaz now with Foden, who's flicked it out to the right-hand side. Little bit of a miscommunication between Foden and Silva. There doesn't happen very often out for a Napoli throw-in, which goes back to Malinkovic. Savage, he puts his foot through it, high into the night sky here at the Etihad. And it is Koshanov who gets there first ahead of McTominay. The ball just bubbling around a little bit, but now Guardiola looks to try and calm things down in the centre circle, Manchester City. Just moving the ball around. Still waiting for our first attempt on goal inside this opening eight minutes, but both teams just trying to settle into the game. And Manchester City now trying to put together a little bit of possession. Dooku again on the ball, plays it back to Diaz. Diaz sweeps the ball over the halfway line to Koshanov on the right-hand side. He's got Diaz back again. And now Rodri and Napoli sitting in that rigid formation, asking Manchester City to find a way to break them down. They'll be quite happy to just let City have the ball as long as it's in front of them. And now a shot from the right-hand side, and that's pulled off the first save off the game from Malinkovic. Savage, it was a wicked effort from Reinders. Outside the penalty area, he put his right foot through it. And Malinkovic, Savage, watched it all the way, had to flick it over the top of the crossbar. Yeah, just inside that left-hand side of the pitch, he comes inside right footed, just outside the penalty area, strikes really strong. It was quite central. Malinkovic, Savage just watched it, made sure he got two palms behind him, pushed it over. There we go, finally we have a little bit of action. Corner comes in from Foden, deep to Dooku, he's all on his own, he just took a poor touch, it wouldn't sit for him, couldn't get a shot away cleanly and it's cleared. But that was a huge opportunity at the back post. Big chance, big deep cross to the back post. And Dooku's there and it's one of those, I'm thinking is he going to head it, is he going to volley it? But it always lands on his chest so he's stuck to decide what to do. He takes his touch, it's a poor one. We have a little bit of concern here, an injury possibly, but it was a big chance for City. Yeah, Rasmus Hoyland is hobbling around. Just feeling his, I think it's his left leg, he's feeling at the moment, but he's on his feet and he's moving around. So no treatment required for Hoyland, Manchester City back on the ball. First real opportunity has come the way of the home side with that Reinder's effort and then from the resulting corner, Dooku with the opportunity at the back post and it's Dooku now who tries to spin away past Politano. No way past though, Manchester City keep a hold of the ball, it is going to be a free kick, I thought the referee was going to let it play on there because City were in possession but he does stop the play. The German referee, Felix Weier, who refereed the Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham last season. So Rasmus Hoyland will be acquainted with him in different colours nowadays. Hoyland as Donoruma launches it long looking for Halland but beaten to it. MacTomany now heads it back to his captain, De Lorenzo and De Lorenzo is going to be forced back to the goalkeeper. Manchester City pressing high, Foden trying to get on the end of the pass out. That was very close but Napoli and Buongiorno able to just get it away and now Napoli come forward. Did you think he was getting on the end of that one there? The goalkeeper passes it right across the face, Foden almost got it, I've got to say it's perfect. Great ball out to the left for Spinitzola and Napoli coming forward, cuts inside really well into the penalty area. He's turned again and now it's left footed across and this time Casanova gets the block in but brilliant play from the left back. He's still got it edge of the area and now goes left foot shot deep looking for Anguisa, gets his head on it, knocks it back towards the penalty spot but Rodri is there to take it off MacTomany's toes and now Manchester City can launch an attack through Dockle over the halfway line. He's looking for options on the right-hand side. He's going to check back and play the ball to Reinders who now sweeps it over to this right-hand side to Casanova but Casanova found himself in a little bit of bother there up against Spinitzola. Yeah he got twisted up but he recovered well. Looking for Halland and there's a foot goes in there from Bukema but Manchester City keep hold of it. Now Halland to Bernardo Silva right side of the penalty area to Foden, Casanova, Foden, Manchester City playing with it just short passes just outside the penalty area trying to create that space to hurt Napoli but every Napoli player is back there between the ball and the goal. So now Manchester City try from the left, Dockle again he's got two Napoli players to beat. He's just dragging the ball with his right foot decides to go back. So now Guardiola moves to the right-hand side and Manchester City are going to have to be patient tonight because Antonio Conte sets his team up very well, hard to break down, organised and Manchester City will have to find a way to unlock it. Just watch the manager now, he's demanding all the time, he's non-stop, he's just been pushing him into positions. Waiting for the mistake which has happened and Guisa picking up the loose pass and now Napoli in possession but in their defensive third out to Dillarengo on the right-hand side he's got Polatano ahead of him and that little ball inside to Huyland but Dillarengo is looking for a free kick which he's not going to get you saw you look at that one Michael. Yeah I thought Dockle would call to him he was disappointed but he's got a react it's gone, here he is he's under pressure. Dockle now to Reinders, Reinders with the ball across headed clear but only as far as Diaz who's got Vardal Fort support, 13 minutes gone here at the Etihad and this Champions League tie between Manchester City and Napoli. We still await the opening goal, Manchester City though with the first attempts on target and on goal it came from Reinders and it was a save tipped over the bar by Malinkovic Savic, it's as close as we've come. Napoli setting up in a defensive style at the moment but Tom only just dropped in really deep just as a little screen he's trying to go inside but he knows he's got to shuffle across cushion off not the out ball because he won't go too far they're making sure the back line can see why he's got to be certain they don't want to get counter attacked. Dockle left edge of the penalty area, drags it round to the byline tries to get the cross in does but it hits the top of the net and it will be another corner to Manchester City and there has been a goal in the eight o'clock kickoffs in the Champions League it's come at Frankfurt it's gone the way of Galatasaray so Frankfurt know Galatasaray won all the rest of the eight o'clock kickoffs goalless if you want to listen to Newcastle Barcelona you can do over on Radio Five Live and BBC sounds but here on Five Live Sports Extra it is Manchester City against Napoli and it's folding with the corner in towards the penalty spot, Vardal is there and Harland they both tried to attack it there was a head that got on the end of it but it looped over Malinkovic Savic's bar and harmlessly out. He went to attack it didn't he quick Harland and Giorno does very well gets close to him, comes in out, envisions everybody and all our monitors what does he think? Where next? These managers have to adapt and change in play City are really high-line trying to squeeze the pitchers Napoli try to play out trying to find little combinations they haven't really got any possession at this moment this is the first little bit and it's a lovely little touch inside to McTomney who's now able for the first time to open his legs and drive towards City's forced wide to spin it solo though inside Manchester City's half and he's got LeBotka the little linchpin in Napoli's midfield he just ticks over doesn't he weights draws he can play diagonally little frame that little holding midfield player just so much and necessarily always appreciated. Paulitano looking to get the cross in it's deflected it's gone out for a corner Napoli's first set piece of the evening they will try and hurt Manchester City from the corner but LeBotka an interesting midfield setup that Napoli have this season there were sort of questions as to where Kevin De Bruyne would fit in when he arrived would one of the others have to drop out and McTomney and then Guisara, Paulitano has been able to fit them all in. Well he moved McTomney out to that left hand side which created the space which is very brave when you've got the player of the year to move him from somewhere he didn't so well referee just stopping a little bit of play kind of rumour under a little bit of contact and pushing him around Hoylund on his toes. Big smile from Hoylund as the referee gives him a little ticking off they're still at it though but in comes the corner it's towards Donorima's goal and he's spilled the touch there is an offside flag up though and it was a wicked delivery swirling towards Donorima's goal there was a touch on it I think it might have been Anguisa with the touch Donorima spilled it but the flag up and that's up at little scare perhaps for Manchester City. Yeah you're just lucky to jump onto that back post the camera just gets his head on it down into the ground in front of the goalkeeper reaction save as he pushes away Hoylund great spot from the official by the way in an offside position very quick with the flag to him the rebounder to went in comfortable save not an outstanding one quite routine but he's done his job. Well the camera it was with the header who scored in his debut at the weekend against Fiorentina signed from Bologna in the summer so Napoli. Yeah big fee as well 31 million euros I believe so that tells you the intent of what they expect of him he took some time to drop in and they're going tight and aggressive press Napoli now trying to push City into the long ball but I think that's dangerous at times because Haaland will go one for one. And now Foden's looking for Haaland the challenge comes in from Dilaranzo he's taken out Haaland on the edge of the penalty area outside the box Haaland is furious the referee has not given anything Dilaranzo's hurt himself and now the referee is wandering over Dilaranzo still on the ground Haaland is asking for a red card. He's asking his hands went up which we don't like to see but when a player lies down when he's challenged he thinks he's guilty I said you don't leave him one by one it creates problems Foden just pushes it into a space Dilaranzo gets it all wrong does he touch him does he get any ball we get a nice little look me initial thought he doesn't the studs just don't touch it the contact comes around big big decision big moment of the game just onto early Haaland's right foot as he misses it that right foot comes around Haaland's waving for cards the referee now the weight every city player was asking and demanding and when they get another look he thinks he's touched it but we couldn't see that could we we couldn't see it Christian Dinger another German official is the video assistant referee this evening it won't be a penalty it's outside the area will it be a red card that is the question we are getting the potential red card check on the big screens here at the Etihad I don't think there is any doubt that this is a red see the Lorenzo right he stays down and he's holding his leg he's thinking I've not really got much of an areas to the money that was the biggest tell of an experienced player thinking oh I'm in trouble then he thinks he's got away with it it's so close it's a difficult one for the official because it's round the other side off to the monitor what we've seen here you go a nice still for you yeah it's never fair I think when they start in a still but he will see the full movement and Felix via the German official he's already shown two red cards and the three games he's officiated this season and will he show another one here there is the signal he goes to his back pocket the red card comes out Napoli are down to 10 their captain Giovanni Dillarezzo is sent off we are 20 minutes into this Champions League tie and Napoli will have to play the rest of the game without their captain and down to 10 this is a huge moment I think what the turning point was is it looked like Erling Haaland wasn't going to get the ball but he's so quick he pushed it into the space the Lorenzo couldn't recover he decides to make the challenge because he thinks he'll get it and when we get another look as a player when you've been in that position you think you've got it your intention is not to foul he's very experienced understands it but we're talking the minimal of touches like on the edge of his studs could have been the difference and he'll say he might have just touched it but it's agonisingly close the ball doesn't move offline but that'll be the message from him Haaland as well steps across it contacting between from there a disappointed Lorenzo leaves the pitch and now an opportunity for Manchester City and you said in the build-up to that it's a dangerous play to try and allow Manchester City to go long to Haaland they did that the ball was one it fell though to Foden it's the second ball the loose ball Foden picks up plays that perfect pass into the path of Haaland who shows that great strength and pace to get round to Lorenzo he he tried all he could to get a foot on the ball but from the pictures it didn't look like he touched it at all and now Manchester City have a huge opportunity from a free kick just on the edge of the penalty area just to the left of the D and they're also playing against a team who are a man down so Manchester City with the opportunity now to make it even worse for the visitors Foden and Reinders the two standing over the free kick will it be the left foot of Foden the right foot of Reinders and it looks like it will be Reinders it's taking a deflection it's going to go out for a corner kick for Manchester City so it doesn't get worse for Napoli yet but the night has become a little bit longer yeah the same Reuben Diaz Nico O'Reilly just trying to block the line of the goalkeeper a good wall one behind it laying down activity on the Napoli bench he's going to make a change he probably has to with the area of the pitch but he's another opportunity for City corner comes in into the hands of Malinkovic Savicen now the goalkeeper will try and take a little bit of time calm it down because Napoli have been rocked here at the Etihad by that red card for their captain there's no rush with the message but he actually decides to go short full credit to them they want to play and keep the ball spin it's all are going long for Hoyland who's wrestling with Diaz and the loose ball latched on to by Silva who just knocks it back into the path off Guardiola and now Diaz out to O'Reilly into Napoli's half as Napoli do prepare to make a change but at the moment it is City looking to heap more misery yeah Polatino has just dropped down into a full back area Scott Midtomino after narrow off now the rigid four just in front and then wherever they can get Hoyland but we'll see what that substituting tails what's next very experienced manager we know but we'll not fancy this chance now with the situation they're in and Dock who going to the byline cutting it back but it is a Polatino who's there to clear it it's still with City though still on the edge of the area and Dock who just stops it going out right on the byline goes back to O'Reilly now the cross comes in there's Halland with a header and it's just over the top of the crossbar he's got his hands on his head he knows that that was a chance good ball in from the left hand side and Halland got contact just not quite able to keep it under the crossbar yeah good delivery so hard for Defender as he runs right across the ball's good and Giorno just trying to get his arm trying to stop it knows there's a good chance there for Halland but now a chance to rethink to wait I think a bit savage just now decides to go along and I'm going to see some activity very very shortly well it is Mathias Oliveira who is ready and waiting to come on for Napoli and now Forden plays it in behind looking for the run of Halland there's a little bit too much on that ball right idea from Forden it's gone all the way through though to my link of it savage but there was space there to play in behind Napoli and Forden tried to find the run of Halland but now Napoli come forward LeBocca spreads the ball from right to left to Spinat Sola back to De Bruyne orange flash of his boots and he's sprayed a beautiful crossfield ball right into the path of Polatano who just can't control and it goes out but that is a Dev Kevin De Bruyne pass who does he sacrifice there we're going to have a little look at it what he decided to do and this is a really really strange decision this is a brave manager to make this and we know Oliveira can go either left back or he might switch across but what a shame in the night that is actually a sacrifice for a red card it is Kevin De Bruyne whose name is being chanted around the Etihad all four stands are on their feet and clapping the man that they used to idolise here at the Etihad he has been the man sacrificed for Mathias Oliveira after the red card to Dilarenzo 25 minutes was all De Bruyne got here at the Etihad which is like you say a real shame he started so well for Napoli two goals already and his three Serie A games slotted in brilliantly into that midfield and we got to see that trademark 60 yard pass from just before he went off the field that's a manager who takes emotions out because he knows he can deliver anything sensational but he also thinks it's such a long time if it was in 65 minutes he might have had a different opinion of it but it's a lot these guys are going to have to have the fittest most dynamic players to try and get anything from this game Manchester City probing again Diaz dinks it in looking for the run of Reinders and it was headed clear but it will be a free kick for Napoli Reinders just barging in to the defender as he tried to win that header little hands in the back Nico O'Reilly as well just an arm round pulling the defender to the floor what a shame to the game these grace so many lovely nights in Champions League and in English football Europeans watching him come back excited to see Kevin De Bruyne he's had a couple of touches he's been waiting for any chance and now he's off the pitch what a sad moment so disappointed his 80th Champions League appearance as well tonight for Kevin De Bruyne 25 minutes was all he got he has had many many memories in this competition though particularly 2023 when he lifted the trophy with Manchester City and now they start the campaign to try and do that once again Bernardo Silva on the ball just looking for an option which he's got from Diaz Diaz now drops it back to Guardio and now back to Diaz still goal this year still goal this at St James's Park as well between Newcastle and Barcelona commentary of that one available on five live sport with John Murray and Dion Dublin and on BBC sounds there's also commentary over on sports extra two and BBC sounds of the Super League match between Hulk here and Warrington Wolves this evening as Dooku tries to create something Manchester City just camped on the edge of that Napoli box I feel I've not looked to my left for a long time it has been all city up in this right hand side and they've won a throw in just level with the edge of the penalty here in the right hand side you'll be able to do that in the second half as you'll even myself out your neck won't be too aching tomorrow for looking at one side but this is just going to be exactly defence wait be disciplined so tough in the middle are playing in those areas when you're up against it and you just have to be organised as you can and try to delay and wait folding to Cassanov puts the ball across it's cleared out by Bakema for a corner for Manchester City and once again Phil Foden with that bandage on his right hand wanders over places the ball on the quadrant another opportunity for City to get the ball into the area Bernardo Silva just moving Halland towards the rear where the ball goes it was heading for the head of Halland but Malinkovic Savage got a big fist in there to punch it clear but again it falls at the feet of a light blue Manchester City now coming forward on the right hand side with Foden skips inside he's got Rodry Rinders lovely pass out to the right to Cassanov now the cross comes in it's deflected only as far as Diaz who is about the deepest player and he's about 25 yards from goal Foden with the shot along the ground the easy one from Malinkovic Savage to just flop down onto his left hand side and smother but again Manchester City beginning to find those little pockets yeah Rodry good ball Phil Foden just pulling out into that number 10 position he's so good to be able to drag it across into the space he gets his shot away goalkeeper he's done ever so well so far in his first half he's been commanding that's the first time down to the ground comfortable he's tried to play out wherever possible he's made the correct decisions and there's a nice little taster of what Phil Foden can do in that area yeah he had a very good debut at the weekend by all accounts Malinkovic Savage solid ball swept over to the right hand side where Bernardo Silva takes a slightly heavy touch but recovers and Diaz is inside for support now Rodry drags the ball back to O'Reilly knocks it into the path of Rinders who turns edge of the area thought he thought about taking the shot but decides to drop it to Dooku who's got Rodry alongside him and that ball right across the face of the penalty area to Bernardo Silva and Foden trying to chop it back on his onto his right foot just loses it momentarily and Rasmus Hoyland the only Napoli player up there all he can do is win the header but there's nobody around him to offer any support so now it comes back again this time Dooku left side of the penalty area Rinders Rodry Manchester City probing looking for the space the space that will have been created by the red card to Napoli captain Dilarenzo so Napoli down to 10 just over the half hour mark as a shot comes in from distance from Cardio but blocked on the edge of the area and now Poletano tries to move it forward but again it's gone to a city foot but this time out of play Napoli win position back and it's going to be a real test of endurance for Napoli given what the way the game has gone since that red card it's been all Manchester City great support from those supporters behind the goal trying to get behind this Napoli side but great build up from Manchester City Josco Fadi all this time range 25 yards decides to have a strike we know he can do it left foot and right foot he could score a goal going very nearly Dooku getting onto a loose pass there back from Napoli towards the goalkeeper but Napoli have been able to get the ball beyond Manchester City's defence with Poletano the sliding challenge comes in for O'Reilly who's writhing around on the ground he's caught him you can tell he's caught him he apologised in this way we're having a little look Nico O'Reilly is just saying he's underneath him but he's getting another look does he leave it on him oh he does you know a little bit he's trying to say hasn't but for me it's a little bit of a straight leg it wasn't the cleanest of strides they might see it different Nico O'Reilly took the apology hasn't he he has he's slid in and Poletano as he is just catching his feet to run past him lands on his leg just around the knee area and there are many pundits I don't know if you're one of them Michael as the corner comes in straight into the hands of Donorima there are many pundits who say that you always know where your feet are going now I'm not suggesting anything by that there's many ex players who didn't know where feet were going that was my excuse for a few of the challenges anyway so do you think he left one on there he possibly could have got out the way of it that's what I would say I was he said it wasn't ideal though he is up he's still feeling that knee a little bit gingerly O'Reilly but he is up back under way on the ball now the 20 year old is making his first Champions League start tonight and the ball into Hallund and under pressure he was from Buongiorno but that was a dangerous little ball into the feet of Hallund Buongiorno did well you know got his foot wrapped it round because he realised once Hallund backs in it's hard to take it he just takes it into the forward areas and sitting just having a little look it's where the management team, Guardiola really good at finding solutions and overloads and putting the extra pressure on Guardiola with the cross left-footed and it's into the hands of Malinkovic Savage but Buongiorno got in the way a little bit and it's loose but it is with Napoli feet just driving out off their own penalty area and Guisa now on this right hand side he's able to put a foot on the ball and try and get something going again for Napoli who struggled since the red card since going down to 10 Malinkovic Savage goes long over the head of McTominay and straight onto the head of Guardiola now Manchester City they just have possession back again through Folden to Silva, Silva twisting turning looking for options he's got it from Reinders just outside the D and the edge of the penalty area he goes to Kasanov and to Diaz Reinders again, Sanoff and Diaz and Manchester City beginning to get the crowd behind them shots have come on City they've enjoyed the bulk of possession but the ball not in a threatening position but that's a good cross looking for Halland sliding in at the back post but it would have been an incredibly special finish if he'd been able to get on the end of that one did you bet against him I didn't want to see him loan for it I'm thinking those legs are so long seeing some great goals Reuben Diaz almost Kevin De Bruyne alike should I say towards that back post as Halland's big left foot dives forward towards that line to try and get some contact we've seen him get it before and squeeze it in certain post but too far on this occasion Dooku battling for the ball comes off at Napoli foot I think it was that Poletano it's out for a Manchester City thrown level with the left side of the penalty area which O'Reilly will take and now with Dooku back Vardiole Kasanov Silva how did Manchester City find a way through what is now really just become a wall of Napoli players Silva cross headed clear to the edge of the area shot comes in it saved Savic but to the feet of Dooku but the flag has gone up but that was a wicked strike from just outside the area Rodri testing the palms of Malinkovic Savic yeah great strikes edge of the area just waiting for chances as midfielders as defenders stepping forward and whether the offside really comes into play it's because it comes back into the path as Rodri strikes into the floor Malinkovic Savic just a real present palms it away and that flag goes up great to see him back getting minutes now Rodri that Ballendo winner we missed so much of him with that terrible injury it took a while to bring him back City certainly missed him it wasn't just him there was others Phil Ford and obvious reasons as well and just couldn't get to where he was the highs he's battling in there with Anguisa but it's Anguisa who's come out on top looking for the run of Hoyland just a little bit too much on the ball allowed Kasanov to get in and clear the ball for a Napoli throw and it was actually McTominay that was racing through onto that ball getting my man United X man United players mixed up could you tell there was the the booze from all the supporters McTominay just starts tries to pick the ball up for a throw and Anguisa does well in the middle and Kasanov just realises McTominay is quick he's powerful he's strong as he's strides into the area he takes no chances he clears it away goalkeeper back Donner on a very vocal telling him well done the throwing comes into the penalty area but City able to get it clear Scott McTominay actually has three victories here at the Etihad from his time at Manchester United it's going to be a really tough test to add to those three tonight with Napoli down to 10 but still they are very much in the game because we are still goalless despite Manchester City having the bulk of possession and having a couple of shots on goal nothing has really worried Malinkovic Savic in the Napoli goal halfside flag goes up against Hoyland but Manchester City will play on as Bernardo Silva just crosses the halfway line finds Foden Antonio Conte just standing down inside of his technical area arms outstretch barking instructions always so involved from the touchline Antonio Conte very passionate manager Riley out to Docku slows the play down he's got Anguisa ahead of him but O'Reilly he drops it back to cross it in and there's a little bit of a mix-up in the Napoli defence and Reinders almost got in it had to be cleared out by a Napoli boot for a corner as Reinders just tried to take it down and take it round and it was Bakema who got a foot in to just knock it out for a Napoli Manchester City corner sorry chance again for City as the corner comes in from the left hand side Malinkovic Savic gets a weak punch on it it fell to Rodry couldn't direct it go forwards back now with Kasanov Foden looking for it on that left hand side but Reinders has it and cuts out onto his right foot and now onto his right hand side where Silva floats it in towards the back post header comes in Malinkovic Savic again diving to his right to knock it out for another corner and it is again head and hands moment from Manchester City and this time is Nico O'Reilly who got a really good header onto the end of that lovely floated ball from Bernardo Silva Rose High just couldn't quite direct it as the corner comes in header again Malinkovic Savic down to his right and now the cross comes back in towards the back post Rodry is there it's fallen to the far side Bernardo Silva and now there's claim for a penalty and this shot comes in and absolutely takes out Spinatsola from close range it's Polatano who's down right on the edge of the area the shot canoned off his head from really close range from Kasanov but that was a real moment of panic for Napoli defensively as the ball came in from the corner Malinkovic Savic with a great save it came back in again and eventually when it fell to Kasanov the strike was vicious Polatano's head stopped it getting towards the goal yeah it's jumped up Polatano with a smile on his face I think the question whether he has been caught he stayed down he delayed he waited using that head injury but are we going to see a better performance Malinkovic Savic a double save and quick succession Jostko Vardiole headed down into the ground top save to the right also that Nico O'Reilly right in that corner also with that header City creating they're really pushing now shot comes in towards the far post from Vardiole and Malinkovic Savic was scrambling a little so glad to see it go just wide of his far post as Vardiole shouts a little cry of anguish as the ball skims past the left hand post that was a really good effort from Vardiole but still we await the opening goal three minutes of the 45 left to play and it is still goalless but it is Manchester City asking older questions against the 10 men of Napoli as the ball is long looking for Hoyland it will go straight through to Donoruma Frankfurt have equalised against Galatasaray in the eight o'clock kickoff they're still goalless in the other three eight o'clock kickoffs earlier on club Bruges were four one winners against Monaco and they finished two a piece between Copenhagen and Laverkusen all the highlights of the Champions League available tonight on BBC one as Reinders tries to wriggle clear on the edge of the area doku prods it in but just can't quite find the run of his Dutch teammate who gives a right smile as the ball trickles out for a goal kick domination from City right from the start complete possession shots efforts at goal could have been a little bit more clinical early on in the first half but Napoli was stubborn they were organised they've waited and tried to delay City but since that red card on the 21st minute they've had to adapt because City are going all the way around different sides pushing it one by one putting the ball in the box not afraid to to go more direct we've seen this might be a little bit of a newer Manchester City isn't feeling the wider positions and so on to stay high and wide doki coming inside but we've got to make the pitch and stretch it as big as possible and the cost of the amount of time left this could be so difficult for Napoli to sustain it Crossfield ball from Rodri to Cassano ball in from Foden and it was Reinders who got on the end of it it was a delicious ball from Foden right into the path of Reinders he tried to flick the header beyond the link of its service just got too much on it and over the top of the bar it went you can see what he was trying to do but it doesn't test the goalkeeper and again that was an opening and Pete Guardiola puffs out his cheeks and turns away he thought there was an opening there but still he waits for the domination to result in an opening goal in this game yeah when you look at it as well I think he gets too much on the connection it's the little touch might have set the goalkeeper the wrong and that's a good battle in the middle referee asking him if he's decided against it Reinders comes clear with it four minutes added to the end of this first half so we have just reached the 45 for to play as Napoli have a rare moment of possession Politanal going down the right hand side he's got very little support and Guisa offers some inside and now Napoli players are able to catch up with play to Oliveira the substitute came on when Dillarengo was sent off came on for Kevin De Bruyne it was the former Manchester City man sacrifices the ball spread over to that right hand side Politanal now now wearing the captain's arm band drops it inside and here's mcdomany into the area back to Politanal and the cross oh god all right I thought the cross was going to come in he was between a cross and a shot there was LeBoccan nothing really happened and Manchester City able to get it clear the loose ball and Napoli if they're going to get anything from this game they need to find a way to be more clinical to make those passes in the in Manchester City's half count because they've very rarely been up there I tell you what the need they just need to see out these last three or four minutes get the manager to set them up get a breather concentration levels got to be so high so difficult everyone's just got to slot in you've got to pull and now all the gaps shuffle across one little area where somebody doesn't do the job city will find and exploit it Rodry pass along the ground Diaz right in front of the goal thought about the shot moved out to the right hand side though for Silva now drives into the penalty area chops onto his right foot back onto his left now lays it down beautifully for Reindersen I thought that was going in pass Malinkovic Savage how did he end up getting his foot on that while there are celebrations from Politanos so my view was blocked a little but I assume he got a foot on it took the pace off the ball and Malinkovic Savage was able to just pick it up Reindersen it was brilliant seeing a replay now brilliant from Politanos the Reindersen effort was going to nestle in the bottom corner Politanos put out a foot stopped the ball almost dead and Malinkovic Savage just picked it up but by doing that he almost put it in the goal it was actually behind Malinkovic Savage and I thought that's an own goal the Bernardo Silva is so well chopping checking and then the ball heading towards that corner but they keep fighting they're giving everything for the manager and these supporters they've travelled a long way there's a foul it is a foul a foul on Doki and Manchester City win a free kick just on the left side off the penalty area Politanos arguing his case though well because they've just let a different one off that they didn't have there's not much contact at all he steps into it there's three or four suits come forward from that Natalie Bench but just getting another look it's behind Malinkovic Savage if it had dived a little bit more spectacularly it would have looked more like one of those David Siemens saves where he's behind him but he was quite safe he he could have made it better for the cameras but he's going so well he didn't need to Politanos celebrating like he'd scored a goal blocking that shot but very nearly putting it into back of his own net Malinkovic Savage I think should have been the one celebrating as the free kick comes in short it's gone wide in the post and I think it was Roger who got the final touch on that one and it will be an appellate goal kick but yeah Malinkovic Savage certainly saving the blushes of Politanos as the Napoli fans behind his goal continue to support their team their arms are raised out that's interesting that peps just saying come on everybody let's get going let's get behind did you see that he's just said it's a little bit it does feel a little flat touch quiet because it's been so dominated by City that they've just rolled the ball around control it they'll be thinking how's your not score the manager with all the possession all the chances some great entertainment some great movement but Napoli side who've been extremely strong have been extremely organised and demanding from each other but it's been a good first half it has been a good first half we haven't had any goals but certainly Manchester City have absolutely dominated they've had the best opportunities Malinkovic Savage has been forced into a number of saves including one from his own player but he has been impenetrable in this first half Malinkovic Savage in just his second appearance for Napoli but the game really turned in the 20th minute went Dilarenzo took down Haaland denying the obvious goal scoring opportunity and after a quick look at the monitor referee Felix Vier brandished the red card and the Napoli captain's night was over Kevin de Bruyne the unfortunate man that was taken off for the substitution for the reshuffle by Antonio Conte but Napoli have been organised they have been stubborn and they have certainly showed all of the attributes you would expect from an Antonio Conte side. You just see the demands from the manager he's not stopped I think he's he's ran and covered so much ground just across that technical area organising moving people around looking and seeing where spaces are shouting on to make sure they close them up it was a big big decision for him to take Kevin de Bruyne off because he knows he could have that special touch something to give him that winner but the long period it probably was a correct decision because they're going to need everybody's legs and de Bruyne is not necessarily the one for legs he's the one with that wonderful right foot who can do things nobody else can they've been stubborn they've been organised as we've said my link of his savage looks like he's having the game of his life looks so comfortable he's took the pressure off with some certain crosses that have come cross could save down to the right hand side but City have looked good they look like they're in their stride they look like they've they create dominating moving the ball around but you've got to find an answer you've got to find a breakthrough and now in half time that's what Pat will be doing it will indeed because at the break here at the Etihad it is Manchester City 0 Napoli 0 and we will now rejoin five live for half-time. In this match to get the result they needed to go into the main stage of the Champions League for the very first time alongside Arsenal and Chelsea that draw takes place tomorrow it's a 3-1 aggregate win tonight though it's finished 3-0 to an impressive Manchester United. It's going to super league both Hull clubs in action tonight but it could be a big evening for both in slightly different ways Sharon Short are watching KR. Yeah and it's taken time but Hull KR have finally got their noses in front in this one they've got a 10 point lead at the break 16 points to six and it was Warrington who started this one the stronger with a try from Josh Thulis and then an effort from Kai Taylor here ruled out for obstruction eventually momentum turned towards Hull Kingston Rovers to the relief of the fans when Tyrone may scored you could almost hear that pressure cooker just being released a little bit. Now a boothers followed up with a double both with lovely moves across out wide for him to score Rhys Martin has converted two of the three so Rovers at the moment still on track for that league leader's shield they lead at half time Hull KR 16 Warrington 6. Meanwhile the other side of Hull are not in their playoff chances much good at the moment they're at half time as well and they are trailing Catalan by 14 points to 12 so Isaac Hayden is with us Dion Dublin is at St James's Park alongside John Murray and you'd agree with Dion would you Isaac that in a game of few chances Newcastle had the better ones? Yeah I'd agree with that I think Barcelona agree into the game sort of 10-15 minutes towards the end of the first half sustained pressure really well and obviously we knew they were going to probably have more possession in Newcastle but I think in transition like I said before the game was key and I thought a langer especially in the first 20-25 minutes was electric and caused all sorts of problems and another day Barnes could have finished that and it could be a different game. I was going to say to you would that be it's a bit simplistic I suppose but that would that be the halftime message to get the ball to a langer ball? Yeah I mean I think I think second half the substitutions would play a big part in the game I think with World of Marder possibly coming on I think Murphy as well who's again started this season almost as he finished last season in very good form I think that could make the difference today. It was a great move wasn't it Dion for for that best chance which a langer set up for Harvey Barnes, Antti Gordon tried to hold his run tried to hold his run was still off side and yet a langer running from deep got on to Trippier's ball. Yeah and I think that's what that's what they'll look to I mean I just feel that Antti Lange with the ball at his feet he's not trying to do anything special he just wants to get the ball into a dangerous area and then he'll deliver it to whoever's there he'll expect people to be there at the moment Barnes has been there and Gordon's been there Barnes should have scored yes it was a good save by the foot of the keeper but they should be one up and I said it before the game you cannot keep missing these chances against a football team like Barcelona and you can't do it you have to put the ball in the back of the net. Is it is it too simplistic again to say that an out and out strike would have finished it? No it's not it's fact it's fact and I do believe if they had a centre forward playing tonight he would have scored one of those goals what happens Shappers is the the the chance comes around and the mindset's very different if you're a centre forward you've done it thousands and thousands of times you know what kind of finish you have to use and you use it a lot of the time if you're not that kind of player you're choosing the finish as the ball's coming towards you so you're thinking about your finish when you shouldn't be thinking about your finish. What would you have done gone back and cross? I'd have been running back on my knees I'd have scored. That's but your finish would have gone back across the keeper presumably. Yeah my life yeah what I would have done what happens Shappers sometimes in those situations is you you can see the ball coming and then the last minute you take your eye off the ball and you look to see where the ball's going to go like a golf shot and therefore you don't connect with it how you should you don't even look at the goal you know where the goal is you use the white lines on the pitch to tell you where the goal is it's not going to move get good connection and then celebrate when you hear the ball rippin. I think because of the surfaces Dion I'm not sure knee slides were a thing when when you were scoring goals. I wouldn't be able to get up I wouldn't be able to get up at the floor after a knee slide. Just stay on your feet put your arms in the air and celebrate that's what you used to do back in the day. Should you have scored Isaac? Yeah it's one of those ones where he's said like Dion said it's kind of coming to him quite quickly he's taken his after ball ever so slightly and then as said he probably should be going back across the goal here but I think Gordon's chance the very first chance early on is I think he's gone with his wrong foot there I think if he goes with his left as it's coming across and just gets on target and uses the pace of the ball I think that was probably you know arguably even a better chance really. Isaac Dion for the time being thank you very much second half on the way then from St James's Park where it is goalless goalless between Manchester City and 10 man Napoli as well in the other two games.

Just shy of nine o'clock Richard Foster has the news. The Voice of the UK. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thanks Mark good evening President Trump and Secure Stammer have held a joint news conference after signing a technology deal worth around 150 billion pounds. They held talks this afternoon and after a business meeting of business leaders at Checkers the Prime Minister says the two leaders have renewed the country's special relationship for a new era. This tech partnership has the power to change lives it's our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential solve problems cure diseases make us richer and freer. President Trump told reporters that the US is trying to get the background airbase back from the Taliban government in Afghanistan and he was also asked about how he feels about Ukraine and President Putin. He has led me down I mean he's killing many people and he's losing more people than he's you know than he's killing I mean frankly the Russian soldiers are being killed at a higher rate than the Ukrainian soldiers I am very disappointed in the fact that that one's not settled. The president also suggested that Secure Stammer could use the military to stop illegal immigration to the UK and says that they disagree about the idea of a Palestinian state. Other stories are seeming and the High Court has rejected a fresh legal challenge to the government's one-in-one out migrant return deal with France. Lawyers for an Eritrionian man had argued that France wouldn't look after him properly but the court disagreed. The governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey says interest rate cuts are still on the cards but says it's sensible to leave them at 4% this month.

Goal of St James' Park, goal of St Yeti had in the two Champions League games involving the English clubs this evening, second halves on the way on Five Live and on Sports Extra, respectively. Meanwhile at the World Athletics in Tokyo, Keely Hodgkinson has eased into the semi-finals of the women's 800 metres as she goes for her first world title. Catherine Merry and Alison Kerbsley were watching. The sixth day here in Tokyo, a wonderful evening session. We had wind and rain, but it didn't dampen the enthusiasm of the fans or the world-class performances. Plenty of Brits in action. We'll talk about them shortly, but we have to start with the women's 400 metre final. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrona, 47.78 seconds, the second fastest athlete of all time. It was a final, Alison, where Amber Anning ran great. She finished fifth like she did at the Paris Olympics last year, but the top three were a different class today. Certainly the top one was. I mean, what we saw was phenomenal. 68,000 full in the stadium, and I think the one person who couldn't believe it was Sydney McLaughlin-Levrona. She went down onto a haunches, shaking her head. I cannot believe that I've seen with my own eyes a woman go sub 48 seconds, jumping her from seventh on the all-time list to second. It was astounding. Not only has she changed the world of 400 hurdles for the better, that event moved it on, but now she's doing it with a flat four. Absolutely obliterated the world and Olympic champion in Paulino, the former world champion in NASA, but I think more impressively it was the clock. It was the time that she did, and quite understandably, she's only just starting to go through the mix zone now. She's going to be a long night for her. She's just off to our right, draped in the stars and stripes, and yeah, everyone is going to want a piece of that woman tonight. Yeah, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrona, now the second fastest ever, as was Maraligh de Paulino, with her national record in silver, running 47.98 going third all time. It was phenomenal. Let's drop down in distance though, Alison, the 200-metre semi-finals. Let's start with the British women, Amy Hunt, Deena Asher Smith. We're talking about going second all time in terms of Sydney McLaughlin-Levrona. Amy Hunt, second on the all-time British list, with her 22.08 clocking. And to be second Brit on the all-time list, you're surping the great Cathy Cook. I mean, running quicker than the Queen of Sprinting. Back in the 80s, this woman was able to do 100, 200, 400. And I think we've got our own now in Amy Hunt. The frustration of the 100, not making the 100 final clearly showed, but it was a very, very composed run. She had the Olympic bronze medalist in Brittany Brown on one side. She had the world champion from Jamaica, Sharika Jackson on the other side. She held her own. She held her head and ran a perfect race for a 22-0. And I tell you what, looking now at the qualifiers, both her and Deena Asher Smith, who qualified in the second semifinal, will be starting to have a bit of a sniff of a medal, because I think there's one there. Well, let's talk about a sniff of a medal and somebody else like Amy Hunt, who had fire in their belly, not making the 100 metre final, Zanelle Hughes in the men's 200 metre semifinals, a sub-22 clocking, looking a lot more comfortable, looking a lot happier, a lot more comfortable. He had the inside lane compared to Noah Lyles. Noah Lyles ran an unbelievable bend. Zanelle held back. He really did have to hold that bend hard, but he left his running for the home straight, and that's where it mattered, qualified by right in second. Let's go to two laps of the track. The rain was coming down for the men's 800 metres semifinals. Welcome back to the Etihad, Manchester City nil, Napoli nil. The team's just making their way back out onto the pitch. The 10 men of Napoli, they lost their captain Giovanni Dillorenzo, a red car, as he took out Erling Halland as he was driving towards goal, denying a goal-scoring opportunity, and he saw red. That was in the 20th minute, so Michael Brown, Napoli, they've navigated 25 minutes down to 10. It is going to be a big ask with the pressure that Manchester City had in that first half for them to see out another 45. That'll be some result if they manage to do it, but can they get forward as well? Can they create opportunities at the right time? That'll be something this manager will be asking, not just to stay in it, to try and contribute, to try and take the ball, to try and take the chances. He knows when to do it. He'll have already prepped for these scenarios. They'll be very organised as we know with the manager, but City also are going to have done their prep and they'll know where the weakens are. So we are back under the lights here at the Etihad, a very warm and balmy evening in Manchester. Tonight, a lot of short sleeves around the stadium, even myself, which is very rare for me, but it is a warm evening. I'm setting a coat, almost for going soft. I was putting it on, I just haven't had time to really think about taking it off. I might have to do that in a second, but hopefully this game is going to hoten up, get some more chances. Can we get a breakthrough from either side? Certainly if Napoli can find an answer, that will open things up and City will come strong, but City will be patient, they'll wait. Some people will say, can they go a little bit earlier, a little bit quicker? That would be the message for me, but Pep knows over time he will grind the sides down. Napoli have come out and they are already pressing higher than they did in the end of that first half. Hoylan trying to put pressure on and Gwissa joining him and LeBocca even getting forward. Donorima on the ball, but Napoli certainly playing higher up the pitch as Michael Brown takes his jacket off. You've even got long sleeves underneath the jacket. You've got in my head now, I'm just a player in a football match, no one could ever get inside my head, but you have done, you said, right, you're too warm, you've got to take it off. I think I must be making you hot with it on. I'm just used to a lot colder climates, I think north of the border. Enemy Manchester City coming forward. Your mind is 10 now, I think. Rodri on the ball, he's got Gavarriol to his left-hand side and now Manchester City coming forward with Dock, who left edge of the penalty area, driving towards Palletano, shuffling right, step over, gets the ball away, lovely ball in towards Reinders, but well cleared by Bungiorno only as far as Rodri, so now City come forward down the right-hand side with Bernardo Silva. Got support from Diaz, Gavarriol. Midway between the halfway line and the edge of the Napoli area. Diaz, Rodri, Manchester City again trying to draw this Napoli backline out. Dock, to the edge of the byline, tries to cut it back, but it is cut out. And now Manchester City pick up a loose ball, so let me run you through the teams. Manchester City as they were at the start against Man United, same starting 11, ball clipped in towards Foden, it's cleared by Bungiorno and now over the head of La Boca, but again it's fallen to City feet. So Donnaruma in goal, the shot from Nico Reilly blocked, falls to the feet of Dock, Dock driving towards the left edge of the penalty area, on to his right foot, touch inside to Reinders, shot away, he was crossing it for Halland, but it was cleared by Bekema, who is down holding his head, is out for a Manchester City corner, that was a dangerous ball across from Reinders. You call it the first one, do you know you blocked the first shot, you felt his knee possibly, he's got across blocked another, but he's got a little bit of discomfort, he's up now, good position, Dock you're doing well, Reinders, he arrives quickly, snapshot, tries to go far post and now City with another corner. Right hand to Phil Foden, Reis and it goes towards the area, headed clear, so let me try and run you through this City team, no let's not because here comes Bernardo Silva, he's got Dock who now on the right hand side, which is where one of his assists came from against Manchester United on that right foot, Reilly gets it back from Diaz, edge of the area, Silva spins, Foden left edge of the penalty area, back inside to Reinders, Reinders drops it back to Rodri, Rodri trying to find Dock who the sliding challenge comes in from Oliveira, but it falls to City feet, so City, Don Roman Gol, a back four of O'Reilly, Vardial, Diaz and Kasanov, Rodri Reinders in that midfield dual, Dock who Foden, Silva supporting Erling Halland up front and it is Reinders out to Dock who switched on to that right hand side, Rodri Reinders trying to flick it round the corner and spin but Buadurno is there to clear and it will go out for Manchester City throwing, so to the visitors, Malinkovic Savic who's had a fabulous game in goal, their back four now is Oliveira at left back, Buadurno, Buquema and Polatano who's dropped back as the ball goes across the face of goal from Foden, there's nobody at the back post to touch it in, he puts his hands over his face, that was an opportunity, I think he was looking for that far post Michael but there wasn't anybody there just to knock it in when it dragged wide, he's pulled it too far actually, great position, Dock who causing problems, he's got a good awareness, that square passes the pre-pull approach, those midfield runs, the heart of the track for any midfield player and strikes it left-footed just across the face, another chance gone away for City, they've got to find an answer, they've got to convert. As Napoli come forward, ball down the left, Hoyland, he's got two Manchester City players around him, he goes down under the pressure and Gwis has got his hands raised asking for the free kick, he's not going to get it so I will continue with that Napoli team, Malinkovic Savic in goal, it's a back four of Oliveira on the left, Bondurno-Bochema and it's Spinazzola at right back, Poletano in front of him and Guisa, Lobocca, McTominay and Rasmus Hoyland leading the line, down to 10 men with the red card shown to Dilarenzo early in the first half and Napoli coming forward through Anguisa, Pipp Guardiola not happy that the visitors are getting a little bit of joy further up the pitch. They've got to have a little bit of territory, this is literally a couple of passes, this is what happens when you don't score, Guardiola is waving his hands around, he's not looking happy at all, very frustrated figure at the moment as the ball into the area and Guisa turns, left edge, he pulls it back beautifully to the penalty spot, nobody there was just ahead of Spinazzola and D'Occu's able to clear and now he ghosts past Poletano who pulls him back, that would be a yellow card for the man now wearing the armband for Napoli, cynical foul as D'Occu tried to race clear. Well how do you stop him because he just dropped his shoulder, stepped inside, he literally left Poletano hasn't he pulled him back, thinking what else could I do, let him drive through the middle, he decides to take a foul but now you've not got any more. Certainly does not and that would make the evening go from bad to worse for Napoli should they get another red card but at the moment they are very much still in this game, still goalless at the Etihad despite being down to 10 the visitors since the 20th minute but Manchester City the team asking all the questions but that is a loose pass which Poletano allows to just cut across him before he gathers and drops it back to Spinazzola, poor clearance though from Spinazzola straight to Cavadial who does well under pressure from Hoyland and again Rodri looking to come forward, lovely turn from Foden into the area with Reinders, onto his right foot, drops it to Nico Reilly who tries to find Foden, it's dropped and fallen though for D'Occu, left foot cross, deep looking for Silva, beautiful touch from Silva on the far side, drops it back to Cavadial looking to pull the trigger, it was sort of a kind of a probing pass through the Napoli defence but straight into the arms of Malinkovic Savic and this is the big question for Pep Guardiola and for his Manchester City team how do they find the Christmas or play the killer pass to create that opening? I think they'll find it, I think it's a matter of time, you see they're going to attire there's Napoli side as we know but when Napoli get the ball they've had a couple of chances they've got to create an extra pass better now, Lobotka he's brave enough to do it to keep it to stay on the ball, he's given it away too many times Spinazzola looking long for Hoylan, cleared though by Guardiola and Napoli are going to make another change and it is going to be Paul Itano who's just picked up that yellow card who goes off, he passes the captain arm band to the man coming on Juan Jesus, a centre back, so a centre back for a right winger, it looks like we're going to get Antonio Conte back three. Let's see how that goes you're not because he obviously realises that he's on a yellow card can't take any more risk he's going to get exposed so decided to have a little shuffle, see how that changes how it affects it is that really a good idea? It was the tried and the tested and the very successful formation of last season as Napoli went on to win the Scudetta, he's changed it up this season, Mormid Fielder's brought into the club he had to find a way to get them all in notably Kevin De Bruyne in particular so he went to the back four, Scott McTominay starting out on the left hand side but drifting in allowed Kevin De Bruyne to just sit in between him and Anguisa but De Bruyne sacrificed in the first half after the red card and now Conte has gone to the back three once again does that set his intentions out would he be happy to leave here with the way things are? He's already said there's the answer Into Holland, gets ahead on it, there's the only goal one little ball into Erling Holland the one chance he needed, a flicked header which looped over the length of its savage and Erling Holland is the fastest man to 50 goals in the Champions League he's done it in his 49th appearance and it is the goal that breaks the deadlock it is the goal that puts Manchester City ahead, who else but Harland, Manchester City won Napoli Nill this guy he just waits for opportunity, Conte makes a decision, it's a great little flick from Forden as Harland steps forward central of the box he knows where the goal is, he doesn't try and head it too hard, he doesn't head it in the ground it's a wonderful ball, he has a little look just dinks it over the goalkeeper, so calm, collective, there he goes off running, Conte makes the change I said it was dangerous, it didn't last long probably a minute and then they were punished Erling Holland doing what Erling Holland does best and it gets a celebration from his manager and if you want to put in context how quickly Erling Holland has got to 50 Champions League goals well the record he's beaten was Rube Van Nisteroy of 62 games so he has done it with 12 games to spare he really is an incredible goal scorer that is his 130th Manchester City goals in all competitions in his 151st appearance and it just took that beautiful little flicked ball through the middle of that Napoli defence and Harland was onto it like an absolute flash with the deftest of finishes that's a different finish isn't it for him we've seen many we talked about that that lunge to the back force, black post we've seen the acrobatic ones we've seen strikes taking 1v1s and that's a nice little soft leaping header he's got the lot hasn't he whenever he's in front of goal understands what's needed, City now it's going to move it go a little bit quicker but they know they need a second one and Dokku trying to provide it into the area onto his right foot drops it for Foden inside looking for Harland eventually gets onto it the second attempt Harland and now with Dokku Harland peeling in behind but he goes to Foden back to goal leaves it for Guardiola just about every outfield player on the pitch camped around the edge of Napoli's penalty area but it's Spinatsola who comes away with it he's got only Hoiland ahead of him and the pass cut out by Guardiola, Harland into the path almost of Reinders and Guisa though stops him getting on the end of it but again he goes long again it falls to City feet and now it's all the way back with Donoramata's, Nico Gonzalez is getting ready below us to come on for Manchester City getting plenty of instruction from Pep Guardiola yeah he's got a decision hasn't he will he protect Rodgery would that be one Arsenal around the corner yes he'll want to win it but that's the difficulty of a manager at this level he understands what's needed but Conti makes the change he got that one wrong because they conceded so quickly it's cruel at times when you do that and you have the belief but let's see what the change will be well Manchester City making it now and it is indeed Rodgery who does come off the man who scored the only goal in the Champions League final is Manchester City for crowned winners that 1-0 victory over Inter so his night is over he will rest up like you say Michael for that big game on Sunday against Arsenal so 1-0 here at the Etihad for Manchester City there's been a goal at St James's Park it has not gone for the home side though and it is Marcus Rashford who has put Barcelona ahead in that one commentary of it available over on Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds so Newcastle, Nill, Barcelona 1 elsewhere sporting 1, Kairat Almaty, Nill and it is Frankfurt 3, Galatasaray 1 earlier on this evening club Bruges beat Monaco 4-1 and Copenhagen and Leibhavid shared the spoils with some late drama to a piece there highlights of all tonight's Champions League matches available on the BBC Sport website later on this evening and also on BBC One as Dooku knocks it back to the edge of the area but a foot prevents it getting to Nico O'Reilly but it's fallen to Gavario and Gwisa goes down clutching his face the referee stops it says it's a head injury must have got a little knock as he tussled for the ball there and Gwisa he looks to be okay gives Pep Guardiola a chance to have a quick word with some of his players he's calling a few over but he'll be just an elbow just it's an elbow from Nico just into his face but it's one of those it's not a swing of an elbow it's when he just gets close as he's making himself big to make an action he's unfortunate he gets caught no wonder he's feeling that one yeah well we are over the hour mark here at the Etihad and Manchester City have found the breakthrough from who else but their number nine Erling Halland with his 50th Champions League goal as Dooku now takes the ball down that left-hand side again Nico into O'Reilly Guardiola moves it infield to Kasanov and Dias was under pressure from Hoyland there but manages to squeeze it through to Guardiola it's a frustrating night for Rasmus Hoyland he would have loved to have come back to Manchester and put on a show but it's really he's been an isolated figure up there he has it's so tough but can he can you find a solution oh an answer when you he's so starved of the ball he's got to wait be patient Harlan does that exceptionally well yes there's more flow coming his way City on the overload into Dooku lovely pass from Nico Reilly but that is really well defended from LeBocca Dooku driving towards goal inside the area and LeBocca got back quickly got a toe in it will be a Manchester City corner but it looked to almost open up there for Dooku he's so quick off that left-hand side very quick LeBocca the hold in midfield player he's there to see off danger that little presence but he gets across quite aggressively now City looking forward and looking to go direct in the central area with his set piece left-fitted and it goes to head off it Nico but wide it goes it looked like a well worked move that just Nico Gonzalez's header wide off the target but nobody traced his run it's square wasn't it it's a flat ball always tough to try and just glance it on he catches it quite square well wide Napoli decide to push everyone forward try and get up the pitch try and get some sort of momentum in a forward area as we haven't seen much of them we did say which way you were going to look left or right it's been that first half it has been mostly left in the second half but now Napoli move it forward into the run of Spinat Solais got Nico Riley for company but he manages to flick it towards the penalty area but it's straight into the arms of Donoruma and there's been a few that have been quite quiet tonight for Napoli and one in particular Scott McTominay we haven't seen much of him such a good season he's covering so much ground he's on that left hand side he's a filling slot he probably will arguably be better in a more central role in this sort of setup but you can't always do that you haven't always got the players you've got to feel like what's the best outcome how can you argue with this manager down to our right hand side still pushing still demanding more as Pep just finds different answers can we see a twist can City get this second goal then you've got to do it quicker for me one thing you cannot say about Antonio Conte is that he's not passionate he is all passionate from the sidelines the Champions League winner as a player at Juventus beating Ajax in the final as Dooku comes forward and he's found the finish this time the ball through the middle Dooku onto his left foot he just managed to find the angle to squeeze it in right across the face of goal into that far corner and again in the blink of an eye City find the little bit of space a little way to get in behind this time is Jeremy Dooku who finds the finish and pet guardia all applause as the Manchester City players all engulfed the little Belgian winger Manchester City to Napoli nil magical from Dooku he sees spaces and then he just commits with pace that's what can hurt you and it looked like he was going to be going the other way away from goal he turns quickly and then that's where his feet comes drives into the space slots it under the oncoming Malenkovich Savage into the far corner goalkeeper couldn't get there because he's so quick just a little cheeky nutmeg the goalkeeper slams the floor defensively can't get near him because he takes everybody out with that pace and direction that's the difference when you do things like that talked about pace it talked about needing to be quicker what about that he just wriggled through a little tiny gap between two Napoli defenders and even one of his own players in there he just bundled his way through and then when it was him one-on-one with the goalkeeper the angle was tight but he found the finish between the legs of Malenkovich Savage and since Napoli have gone to this back three they've conceded twice and you have to say Michael it's got to be game over now yeah you certainly think so but I always find it hard to say that with a Manchester City side who made things very difficult at times here he goes Jeremy Dooku pushing back now he just checks and waits it allows a bit more patience ball in looking for Harlan doesn't get a little flick out to Dooku and Spinachsola is able to launch it clear and Anguisa will get on the end of it Gvardiol tried to clear it missed it completely now Anguisa driving towards the Manchester City area checks back LeBocca now back to Anguisa on this right hand side but his pass is really poor and Dooku just picks that up and says thank you very much Niz looks a tired figure Anguisa Pep's going crazy Yosco Vardio try to flick it inside missed it Anguisa just makes great runs but Pep's jumping out the technical area about the recovery runs of Manchester City then they could go quick Dooku gets it he just says wait let's set it up be patient let's not get counted let's not do anything daft because that was a little moment there City got square on this is an interesting substitution for Pep Guardiola he's just next to him now yep the Brazilian Savino is stripped and ready to come on just putting a little bit of tape around the bottom of his socks as Nico O'Reilly drives towards the penalty area inside to Foden Foden back to O'Reilly all just got the ball tangled under his feet a little bit as sort of looks to the sky that was nearly an opening for the young fullback that was a bit showboating from now a little bit more of a senior player from the Academy Phil Foden to another new recruit Nico O'Reilly driving from left back into positions little one two he's very clever that reverse pass almost gets in but just under his feet and what's the change going to be for the Pep Dooku done so well yep Dooku who's making weight so that goal from Jeremy Dooku to make it 2-0 his last real piece of action and he gets a huge arm round the shoulder from his manager as he walks off and Savino takes his place on the left hand side 2-0 to Manchester City here it is now 2-0 to Barcelona at St James's Park do you want to guess who scored Michael go on then Marcus Rashford it's second of the evening write him off when you you dare do it he just keeps coming back doesn't he this could be a really good move for him wonderful player let's see we hope he gets back to his best England could do with that but he's certainly having a nice return to English shores this evening at St James's Park as Savino gets his first chance to run and look inside for Foden gets it a second 10 back to Savino lovely touch from Foden but he's pushed wind Savino across comes in from Silva and it is to play tonight for a corner that was lovely from Phil Foden yeah Phil Foden delighted his back playing getting minutes it's just an infectious player who had a difficult season now finding his way into the team that Manchester Derby goal setting that confidence back that Phil Foden we know he's contributing a big way tonight also little city putting pressure on corner is short to the edge of the area back to Foden in with the in-swinger but Malinkovic Savic able to claim it as we take into the final 20 minutes off this Champions League opener for these two teams Manchester City leading by two goals to nil that is also the score line at St James's Park but not for the home side it is Barcelona who lead there as Napoli prepared to make a trio of substitutions so Anguisa will make way for Elmas in the first off those changes also Rasmus Hoyland will make way David Nere's coming on for him there's the booze for the former well technically current Manchester United man on loan but with an option to buy at the end of the season for Napoli and also Billy Gilmore makes his way onto the field he replaces La Butka so a trio of changes for the visitors as they try to make something happen and first touch for Nerez finds Gilmore but it's ended up back at Malinkovic Savic representation tonight from Scotland is increasing it is indeed and do you know there is actually a pizza that was made in Glasgow in a restaurant in honour of mcdomony and Gilmore moving to Napoli i could give you a i could give you a quiz and see if you can guess what the toppings were they'll save that whenever you're ready yeah a lovely player Billy Gilmore knowing him right throughout his junior career met him early on really tired he nice player obviously La Butka and Anguisa and De Bruyne are now keeping him out of the team he's a great backup for contact it's a shame he can't get a few more minutes yeah he has been a fabulous player 24 years old now Billy Gilmore but a mainstay of the Scotland national team and already a Champions League winner with Chelsea yeah amazing both him and mcdomony's family are here down tonight to watch them both which is great to see for them how well they're doing when they leave the country they have certainly enjoyed life in Italy and now Napoli come forward over the half wayline and it's out with Spinat Sola on this right hand side bodies getting forward for Napoli into Gilmore he's twisting back onto his right hand side and find Spinat Sola again on that right touch line gets it back the little Scott drops it back to Bon Journal any update on what you think the toppings might have been um cheese tomato have we got any of them have we got any of them right yourself up well the the pizza was buffalo mozzarella haggis meatballs mascarpone and whiskey sauce yeah that was a stand-up standing pizza you know i'm not i'm not sure it would go down with too many but apparently it was very popular have you tried it i have not tried it um i should really do that that's the next game we do i want to not see an update on it yeah but yeah real excitement when the two Scottish boys went over to Napoli such an iconic club in football from the days of Diego Maradona but a number of Scottish players making their way over to Serie A in recent years two of them on the field of play here this evening now as Manchester City come forward again as we head towards the 75 minute mark Manchester City we'll be happy to see this game out now Michael but you always know that treacherous 2-0 score line should they have a little glimpse and come concentration and allow Napoli back in it could get a little bit nervy but at the moment you're just doing that chastity at the end you're doing that chase at the end no you want to just make sure you've got full control that's the message from Pep and it just ease yourself in towards the end of the game because you keep saying it that huge game at the weekend you can't be complacent and look too much into that but you've ever got a better way of just moving the ball it's flat just waiting Napoli also as well thinking right will also must take this we don't want to get a real batter in we've done so well at the start of this season it has been an excellent start to the season for Napoli in the defense of their Serie A title three wins from three albeit they needed a 90th minute goal to get past Calary but they found a way and they sit top once again off Serie A level on points with Juventus who also have three wins from three but it's going to be a different season to last season for Antonio Conte having to battle on a European front as well as a domestic front something that certainly aided him last season as he led Napoli to the title in his first season in charge. A commentator on that game against Calary he just felt they just kept pushing and pushing and Guise had just made it into the penalty area at the end of the celebration they felt the togetherness in the side we think we showed that in the first half of the defensive setup yes they didn't get out they didn't create much against the city side it was so tough when they're in the stride to do that but no they got to take something from it it was a decision that their captain made the Lorenzo which he was so close but he got caught out mistakes happen and that's what's given them no chance this evening. And now Bernardo Silva looks to try and make it worse for Napoli the ball in drops to Savino edge of the area onto his left foot cuts it across but it's cleared before it can reach the foot of Nico Reilly only as far though as Nico Gonzales drops it back for Diaz and now Savino gets another chance from this left-hand side again he tries to skip past Spinazzola he goes down under pressure the referee's having a look but he's pointed for the goal kick that was right on the edge of the penalty area Savino gave the referee a long look he's still giving him a long look we'll get another chance to have a see of it but Spinazzola challenging with Savino anything for you? Yeah there wasn't much in it I think the legs went below Savino defensively very very strong that it's difficult when a wide player pushes you right into that space but yeah referee had a look decided against it Citysville probing asking different questions from different angles here's the changes from Pep as we expected we'll be looking towards the weekend it's dangerous to do it we obviously feel it's confident I think the players he's got available on the bench he should have every faith that they can do the job yeah it's a trio of changes getting ready I thought it was just the two but it will be three with Rico Lewis also getting stripped down below us it's always great for the commentator when there's three substitutions at once you have to have a bit of a scamper around to oh stickers everywhere stickers everywhere yeah I'm watching but here's that Rico Lewis Nathan Ackie Oscar Bob I hope he achieves he had a bad injury last season and he's a wonderful talent he started the season and felt like he would have been in for some time he's now back on the bench he's he's very versatile yeah big opportunity for some of Manchester City's younger players the injury list is lengthier than I'm sure pet would like at the moment with my mousse Cherokee Kovacic eight noory all out Calvin Phillips not part of the Champions League squad so an opportunity for these young players to gain valuable minutes and it will be the uh Rinders coming off for Bob in the first of the three changes so Oscar Bob making his 37th appearance this evening for Manchester City Gavardio another coming off he will be replaced by Nathan Ackie and they are preserving their man up front Erlen Halland scorer of the opening goal here this evening he will make way he will refresh those legs because he will be required to go again that is for sure on Sunday in that huge game against I see Oscar Bob replaces Harland as a number nine I talked about being versatile a lot of people wouldn't have thought he'd go as a number nine subpoena left hand side Bernardo stays right Rico Lewis just drops into the middle of the pitch this support where Rinders was just heading okay obviously slotting in left-sided centre back for Yosco Vardio the experience now what he brings he's been a partnership many occasions hasn't it him and Ruben Diaz as Manchester City come forward stopped though by Scott McTominay who's now got Bob scrapping at his heels but he manages to knock it clear and now Gilmore with the ball out to that left hand side but cut out by Silva Ackie bright orange boots just gleaming in the floodlights at the Etihad clear warm night in Manchester we're into the final nine minutes Manchester City comfortable with our 2-0 lead against the 10 men of Napoli as they look for an opening the substitute's all coming on all wanting to impress it's a huge game at the weekend at the Emirates they will want to play a part in that Savino two to get past so he checks back drops it back to Diaz and Manchester City they have such a strong Champions League home record I'm beaten in the last 21 group stage matches here at home winning 18 of them they look certain to make that 22 with the way things are sitting this evening at this stage just eight minutes plus at a time Savino inside to O'Reilly gets it back from Ackie City just moving the ball around Savino left hand side now tries to drive towards the penalty into the left edge goes towards the byline chops back no room for the cross now he looks for options get support from Ackie back to Savino plays a little one two with Oscar Bob and O'Reilly and now Bob is challenged fairly and strongly by Bukema Napoli win possession back but they are deep in their own half as Elmash tries to get clear he's dispossessed Picardiola still prowling around the edge of his technical area Savino cross blocked into the arms of Milinkovic Savic stops the corner Picardiola this is 17th Champions League campaign takes them level with Jose Mourinho he's got some record hasn't he just keeps ticking them off new challenges new chapters different ways of playing different personnel and this one as well new coaching staff come and test me out you know what he says that's the message not just the players I need to freshen things up it's been a good performance overall yes it's been made easy but with the 10 men but City earned it City put them under pressure to make that decision seem comfortable it's a nice start this last year the Champions League they felt like you could recover later on with the games in a different format important to get a win straight away it is and he spoke about that in the build-up to this game because last season they didn't win their opening game of Champions League they drew it also at home against the Italian champions Inter last season who went on to reach the final but Manchester City never really fully got going in the Champions League last season they lost five of last seven games which is as many as they'd lost in the previous 61 games in the competition combined had to go through the playoff stage where they met Real Madrid who'd also had a very average group stage run of games and it was the Spaniards who went through to the last 16 so Manchester City knocked out before the competition for them for somebody for a team of their caliber really got going I was doing a lot of the games you just felt okay there's two or three games at the end you'll just win those and qualify and that's what you felt in this situation but playing everybody wants is much harder the top teams don't get a look at them so much regarding right we know what happened last time we know how to go and punish them it's much more work for the analysts their preparation different people to come up against them it was interesting yeah certainly a format that a lot of people felt perhaps favoured the the clubs who maybe traditionally would have been finishing third or fourth in the smaller group stage multiple group stage format of the competition rather than those that were used to winning the first few games and ensuring the their progression was already secured before the last game or so off that group stage but it's all different now there's new format I enjoyed the new format last season I have to say I was enjoying it for a while then I thought I was looking forward to the later stages with a lot of Manchester City games but it's always good we want to mix we want new people coming to to cause problems all around Europe it's a wonderful competition Manchester City have started their new campaign off very very well clean sheet two goals so far as the ball just ricochets off Oscar Bob as he goes for it and there's an injury on the edge off the area I think it's Bondurno that's down the Napoli centre half as he just tried to challenge Bob for that ball it skimmed through to the grateful hands off Malinkovic Savage but he looks to be in a little bit of pain Bondurno he's getting helped his feet now by Foulden I think you look at the game now Manchester City saying job done we want to leave it I feel like the Napoli players are going well we've got 10 men we've give absolutely everything we know we're not going to win look at what's the weekend you know it's like it's just later stages of games that you know you can't control you know you can't change you can't do anything about it it's kind of a little bit flat a little bit dead as we've just got a little glance on the camera there of Kevin de Bruyne as those fans just give him a little bit of a sing song as they start to leave the stadium you might not get to see him here again yes and his return to the Etihad was cut short the player sacrificed by Antonio Conte after the red card to Dillarezzo he had to put on another defender Conte and it was Kevin de Bruyne on his return who was the man who who made way for that substitution but Neres picks up a loose ball now he's all in his own but he's driving forward he's now got support on the left hand side from Oliveira Napoli players trying to get forward to give some support Oliveira does well and now mcdomany to Gilmore Napoli keeping possession they've dropped it back though it's back with Bon Giorno now onto the halfway line with Bacchema and Spinach-Sola Napoli just I think happy perhaps just to have a little bit of the ball for a change if you've seen Antonio Conte though he felt like there was a break he's screaming to play the forward pass he always thinks you never know can they just create something but they're passing now just for the sake of keeping the ball I get it but we've got to make a pass forward someone's got to make a run might as well have a go Billy Gilmore on the ball passes to a Scotland teammate Scott mcdomany gets it back on the halfway line just looking for that run that option nothing ahead of him he wants to play it but he also knows that if he gives it away he won't get it back for another few minutes that is the problem when you play Manchester City fourth official just standing below us with the board to let us know how much added time as we tick towards the 90th minute and it's Manchester City in possession on the halfway line it is Erling Haaland and Jeremy Dock who's goals that are the difference between the two sides has there been a it's two minutes added to the 90 has there been a standout for you this evening Mike Orr has it been a team performance from City that's impressed you the most I think we've we've got to look Jeremy Dock who was the exciting outlet wasn't he the times feel folding contributing in the middle of the pitch on equal Riley joining in we can keep going can't we rodry getting minutes it's where do we actually stand on it Bernardo Silva that trickery created opportunities adding pressure early on the defensively the City of Lux sound you can understand why is that because of the threat that wasn't really there but you already play what's in front here play the game exactly as it infu you know comes out but he's desperate to have a go any Savino decides against it but your real solid performance happy to take the points and really ended in the correct manner with the run of fixtures coming forward there's a tough run of fixtures starting with that trip to the Emirates on Sunday Arsenal of course have had a couple of days extra rest they played on Tuesday night their victory against at Leicester-Belbao will that play a part do you think in what happens or may or may not happen on Sunday it's got to now I think if you you said to Pupquartie all look at you have more rest going into this game it certainly take it and it is especially at this stage of the season when some of these players haven't played too many minutes to go right three games in a week to balance it correctly the extra time but it's been a nice as I say 30 minutes for City where they've not actually been sort of put underneath pressure and turned around and it's been calm and collected from me there will be live commentary on radio five live and BBC sounds off that really tasty clash at the Emirates between Arsenal and Manchester City have passed four on Sunday that one kicks off it follows commentary of Sunderland against Aston Villa which is an interesting one given that the two teams starts to the season Sunderland been very strong at home and there is the full-time whistle it draws to an end this opening match for Manchester City and Napoli in this season's Champions League and it is the home side the light blue of City who come out on top two goals on the night the first a delicate little header that flicked over the top of the diving Malinkovic Savits from Erling Haaland as he notched up 50 goals in the Champions League in just 49 appearances and then Jeremy Dockoo seeing the space that nobody else could see bundling his way through it and with a really tight fit really nice finish from a tight angle through the legs of Malinkovic Savits but the game turned really in the first half it became a bit of a mountain to climb for Napoli when they had their captain sent off as he pulled down Erling Haaland denying the obvious goal scoring opportunity nothing the referee could do but brandish the red card and that made it a difficult night infinitely more tricky for Napoli and eventually Manchester City found a way to punish them and we can see Kevin De Bruyne out on the pitch with his former teammates all around him he is such a favourite here but it's not ended in joy tonight for De Bruyne on his return a few glum faces in the dark shirts of Napoli but Manchester City well deserving of their victory yeah extremely well deserved they put pressure on the momentum if they're passing good possession Napoli just decided to retreat and give City the ball said come and break three of us and they were finding it tough. Mike of his Savits in goal and some good saves and looked to have a great presence but the one decision where it went long into Haaland that he spun it behind the Lorenzo thought he had it made a decision to tackle and at that point the red card was given and it was always going to be uphill City completely moved the ball and dominated the rest of the game and that was all about Phil Forden Haaland Haaland with that lovely little depth header Dockoo the brilliance of wide players with pace running at people to finally get that goal and it was very easy in the end for City. The Napoli players go over to applaud their supporters who have been absolutely brilliant throughout the night they've been loud they've supported their team there is real positivity around Napoli after winning that title last season the reinforcements and strengthening that Antonio Conte has been able to do in the summer in terms of his squad they've won three out of three to start their season but it's because that runners come unstuck here at the Etihad but down to 10 men for so long in this game they will feel like they have seen their players give everything this evening and it will be back to Serie A back to defending their title before their Champions League trail continues next up for them a home tie against sporting but it is now all eyes on Kevin De Bruyne he's wandering around all four stands just now he's gone to the Napoli supporters with his team and now he's being given the opportunity to lead the line amazing to lead the Manchester City players to applaud all the home fans that are left inside the stadium it's a beautiful sight it's like he's the captain leading Manchester City around on their lap of honour this is and now he's almost thinking i've got to leave them a little bit get forward because i might have done this too much but legends players of the game you've had mired it's a sad day now i thought i'd already said that once before i won't see him again here at the Etihad and it's going to get less and less that percentage of doing so well the smiles are there what a player this just gets a few hugs as he comes off but the city players done a rum joy in his early life as Manchester City have that laugh of honour a great start of the Champions League yeah a big sign in the Manchester City ends saying King Kev once a blue always a blue a special night for him sadly cut short as he was taken off the field early tactical changes from Antonio Conte no emotion in those sorts of decisions made by the Italian boss and now Kevin de Bruyne gives a wave as he wanders back up that Etihad tunnel you thought he'd done it for the last time he has been able to do it one more time and he's now followed by all the Manchester city players and it is Manchester City it put three points on the board to start their Champions League campaign the perfect start two goals a clean sheet three points job done it's finished here at the Etihad Manchester City to Napoli nil",
