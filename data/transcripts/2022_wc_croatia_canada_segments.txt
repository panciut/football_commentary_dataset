[0.00 - 6.00] P:1804.62 E:0.055225 |  And certainly Croatia, bearing in mind, they've got Belgium to come next Thursday.
[6.00 - 10.00] P:1680.76 E:0.093510 |  They'll be targeting this to get the three points themselves.
[11.00 - 13.00] P:1749.14 E:0.106666 |  We're under way. You're listening to Five Live.
[13.00 - 20.00] P:1820.38 E:0.086198 |  Yet another game on BBC Radio Five Live that is live all 64 games.
[21.00 - 27.00] P:1665.43 E:0.082104 |  Right the way through to the conclusion of this tournament here in Qatar.
[27.00 - 32.00] P:1736.56 E:0.090604 |  On Five Live and BBC Sounds as the ball will run through to Boyan.
[33.00 - 38.00] P:1756.46 E:0.085208 |  35-year-old, very, very experienced, actually born in Croatia but fled
[39.00 - 46.00] P:1785.07 E:0.084835 |  during the Croatian War of Independence, which was what, 91 to 95, settled in Canada.
[46.00 - 49.00] P:1565.29 E:0.081612 |  Now plays his football in Serbia.
[50.00 - 53.00] P:1573.54 E:0.069664 |  And vastly experienced keeper in his...
[53.00 - 60.00] P:1591.02 E:0.070665 |  in his aqua-green goalkeeping outfit away towards our right-hand side.
[60.00 - 67.00] P:1779.47 E:0.078328 |  As Canada slowly but surely will build from the back the shot count that they had against Belgium, 22-9.
[67.00 - 69.00] P:1681.41 E:0.077642 |  Yet only three was on target.
[69.00 - 74.00] P:1826.79 E:0.091533 |  And Karen Barzely was spot on earlier on when she said they just let that quality in and around goal.
[74.00 - 78.00] P:1839.34 E:0.094319 |  But Laryn has been brought into the side, good control, out it goes towards Buchanan.
[78.00 - 81.00] P:1955.49 E:0.107422 |  Buchanan with a cross, and Fulton Davies!
[81.00 - 84.00] P:1872.94 E:0.112187 |  What a moment for Alfonso Davies!
[86.00 - 90.00] P:1841.33 E:0.106550 |  Canada's first ever goal scorer and a men's World Cup.
[90.00 - 94.00] P:1821.82 E:0.098509 |  And he's produced the quickest goal of this tournament so far.
[94.00 - 96.00] P:1744.20 E:0.076089 |  What a start!
[96.00 - 99.00] P:1749.59 E:0.103570 |  They lead Croatia by a goal to the hill.
[100.00 - 103.00] P:1700.00 E:0.107367 |  Downward header, gave the goalkeeper no chance.
[105.00 - 108.00] P:1714.09 E:0.098558 |  What a goal from Canada, what a strike.
[108.00 - 114.00] P:1715.92 E:0.098323 |  I was just thinking, if Croatia want to sit off the way they have done at the start of this game,
[114.00 - 116.00] P:1723.68 E:0.093502 |  they're going to get punished.
[116.00 - 118.00] P:1598.86 E:0.091171 |  And boy have they paid the price.
[119.00 - 126.00] P:1548.61 E:0.094883 |  Jonathan David has brought the ball down off of the back four, turned, no one within ten yards of him.
[126.00 - 130.00] P:1542.04 E:0.102365 |  It goes wide, the cross into the box is decent, it's in a good area.
[130.00 - 133.00] P:1547.30 E:0.100705 |  And Alfonso Davies, well he's just arrived.
[133.00 - 140.00] P:1478.86 E:0.094662 |  Totally unmarked, gets up high, so free header is so simple, he just punches it down into the floor.
[140.00 - 144.00] P:1551.59 E:0.103679 |  So really good header, but how bad a start is that from Croatia?
[145.00 - 148.00] P:1620.18 E:0.100378 |  Well, well, well, what a moment.
[148.00 - 154.00] P:1750.01 E:0.089486 |  They drew blanks against France, Hungary and the Soviet Union in 1986.
[155.00 - 158.00] P:1779.79 E:0.094379 |  They battered Belgium but couldn't find a way through.
[159.00 - 161.00] P:1766.65 E:0.092818 |  And the man who missed the penalty
[162.00 - 169.00] P:1717.72 E:0.076864 |  has now scored what will be an iconic moment for men's football in Canada.
[171.00 - 175.00] P:1765.30 E:0.092823 |  The previous quickest goal so far was Gatka after six minutes.
[176.00 - 178.00] P:1772.77 E:0.083790 |  I reckon that was about 70 seconds.
[179.00 - 184.00] P:1785.17 E:0.087883 |  And Alfonso Davies has scored for Canada, who lead by a goal to nil.
[184.00 - 188.00] P:1788.99 E:0.074748 |  And all of a sudden, we said before that Grupec was fascinating,
[189.00 - 192.00] P:1732.06 E:0.073066 |  it has ramped up the stakes for last year's runners-up,
[192.00 - 196.00] P:1829.41 E:0.090794 |  or the last runners-up of the World Cup, Croatia from four years ago.
[197.00 - 198.00] P:1612.83 E:0.079401 |  But what a header.
[200.00 - 203.00] P:1835.59 E:0.084196 |  He gave Liverkovic the goalkeeper no chance.
[203.00 - 206.00] P:1839.58 E:0.091929 |  Coming in as a left wing back, the golden boy for Canada.
[208.00 - 210.00] P:1716.33 E:0.076400 |  A header that was simply unstoppable.
[212.00 - 216.00] P:1683.88 E:0.084563 |  And from a neutral's point of view, Matt, it really now does set the tone
[216.00 - 219.00] P:1675.33 E:0.065758 |  because Canada are going to have opportunities now
[219.00 - 223.00] P:1776.75 E:0.080755 |  to maybe counterattack Croatia as they go forward.
[224.00 - 230.00] P:1694.95 E:0.071145 |  It was almost a mindset of Croatia not to be close,
[230.00 - 233.00] P:1758.84 E:0.086566 |  not to get tight, not to push up the pitch.
[233.00 - 236.00] P:1874.42 E:0.086773 |  And they just allowed so much space to receive the ball.
[236.00 - 239.00] P:1707.57 E:0.074387 |  They dropped right off, invited the opportunity onto themselves.
[239.00 - 242.00] P:1640.37 E:0.076198 |  And we haven't even touched on the formations.
[242.00 - 244.00] P:1711.72 E:0.090408 |  I mean, Canada have started with a back four.
[245.00 - 249.00] P:1655.72 E:0.080080 |  We've got Lerea, who played right wing back in the first game, playing left back.
[249.00 - 252.00] P:1572.88 E:0.082330 |  So he's completely switched it up, and it looks like Davies
[252.00 - 256.00] P:1745.25 E:0.083630 |  has just got that free roll to go forwards and arrive in the box.
[257.00 - 259.00] P:1654.52 E:0.089529 |  Well, I said it was probably around 70 seconds.
[259.00 - 262.00] P:2045.04 E:0.089435 |  We knew it was the quickest goal of this tournament so far.
[262.00 - 266.00] P:1885.91 E:0.074096 |  It has been officially timed at 68 seconds.
[267.00 - 271.00] P:1834.19 E:0.092669 |  Wow. The fastest goal ever in case you're wondering in a World Cup
[271.00 - 275.00] P:1843.09 E:0.078410 |  was Hakkensjuk air in 2002, just the 11 seconds,
[275.00 - 278.00] P:1868.46 E:0.073866 |  Turkey against South Korea.
[278.00 - 284.00] P:1812.65 E:0.073659 |  But what a start for Canada, and what a moment for Alfonso Davies.
[284.00 - 287.00] P:1664.88 E:0.064337 |  You were keeping a close eye on that first goal as well, weren't you, Dan?
[287.00 - 288.00] P:1555.03 E:0.095666 |  I was, yeah.
[288.00 - 289.00] P:1622.31 E:0.076939 |  It's a little thing of yours, isn't it?
[289.00 - 290.00] P:1667.87 E:0.082879 |  Yeah, it is.
[290.00 - 295.00] P:1886.47 E:0.079152 |  Well, up until today, 13 of the 26 matches that we've had so far
[295.00 - 299.00] P:1885.05 E:0.081423 |  have been goalers at half time, which is quite a high number.
[300.00 - 302.00] P:1719.85 E:0.083809 |  We'll not obviously be adding to that one.
[302.00 - 308.00] P:1855.77 E:0.074324 |  And Canada with a rapid start, Croatia rocked back onto their heels.
[309.00 - 313.00] P:1764.34 E:0.085130 |  But it was a great cross from the right-hand side from Buchanan.
[313.00 - 317.00] P:1900.66 E:0.071052 |  Here is Kovacic, and it certainly now sets the tone.
[318.00 - 321.00] P:1897.10 E:0.091601 |  We were looking forward to this game anyway with the comments
[321.00 - 323.00] P:1738.86 E:0.094838 |  made by Herdman and how Croatia responded.
[323.00 - 325.00] P:1919.27 E:0.084763 |  They feel they've been disrespected.
[326.00 - 330.00] P:1767.14 E:0.086624 |  And certainly now, as the ball goes out towards Sosa on that far side,
[330.00 - 335.00] P:1784.13 E:0.077552 |  the left plays it to Gavadio, sporting the face mask,
[335.00 - 338.00] P:1752.39 E:0.081096 |  the very impressive Leipzig defender.
[338.00 - 343.00] P:1793.91 E:0.092833 |  By words, it will be a matter of time before we see him in the Premier League.
[343.00 - 346.00] P:1783.39 E:0.081913 |  A very, very strong target for Chelsea.
[346.00 - 349.00] P:1882.93 E:0.087502 |  Gavadio, only 20 years of age.
[349.00 - 352.00] P:1579.41 E:0.073593 |  It was a poor start from Croatia's back four, though, wasn't it?
[352.00 - 353.00] P:1600.14 E:0.092396 |  Yeah.
[353.00 - 356.00] P:1815.07 E:0.077625 |  He was really fearful, almost just sat right off.
[356.00 - 361.00] P:1797.62 E:0.067034 |  The ball was cleared, and Jonathan David, I mean, he just controls the ball.
[361.00 - 364.00] P:1683.67 E:0.078604 |  He can't believe a centre-back hasn't gone tight.
[364.00 - 365.00] P:1740.50 E:0.107191 |  You're early on in the game.
[365.00 - 368.00] P:1675.60 E:0.078288 |  You're looking to put a marker down as a centre-back.
[368.00 - 370.00] P:1752.52 E:0.082607 |  I'm going to dominate you as the opposition today.
[370.00 - 372.00] P:1800.28 E:0.085419 |  They just dropped ten yards. He plays it wide.
[372.00 - 375.00] P:1670.75 E:0.079189 |  It's just so passive. The whole opening from Croatia.
[375.00 - 378.00] P:1915.47 E:0.066520 |  This is Kramaric.
[378.00 - 380.00] P:1863.46 E:0.081213 |  Kramaric with the cross, takes it.
[380.00 - 382.00] P:2070.19 E:0.113175 |  He's got a defensive deflection. Loops in the air.
[382.00 - 384.00] P:1844.32 E:0.059402 |  Boyan actually lost it.
[384.00 - 386.00] P:1959.83 E:0.090506 |  Underneath the goal post.
[386.00 - 390.00] P:1830.86 E:0.063547 |  Whether he was caught in two mines, the ball in keeper.
[390.00 - 394.00] P:1868.40 E:0.078660 |  But as the cross came in from the right-hand side from Kramaric,
[394.00 - 396.00] P:1894.68 E:0.082207 |  he tried to catch it underneath the goal post.
[396.00 - 400.00] P:1772.39 E:0.081246 |  Took a technique of spinning, and then he caught it before it dropped to the floor.
[400.00 - 402.00] P:1818.51 E:0.078206 |  I think it was awkward because it was just sat on top of the crossbar,
[402.00 - 405.00] P:1689.92 E:0.075435 |  and he couldn't get his wrists round the crossbar to catch it,
[405.00 - 407.00] P:1640.02 E:0.062911 |  so he just had to pat it down.
[407.00 - 409.00] P:1527.78 E:0.079030 |  It was a convincing piece of goalkeeping,
[409.00 - 411.00] P:1772.78 E:0.077841 |  but I'm just having to look at the spaces again
[411.00 - 413.00] P:1469.15 E:0.095271 |  in the middle of the park between the lines.
[413.00 - 415.00] P:1843.89 E:0.080644 |  If Canada get two or three passes off,
[415.00 - 419.00] P:1673.09 E:0.081342 |  there's a big difference between the back four and the midfield from Croatia.
[419.00 - 421.00] P:1717.96 E:0.069119 |  Big gap in there.
[421.00 - 425.00] P:1759.04 E:0.077310 |  Good play on the near side by Luria.
[425.00 - 428.00] P:1649.99 E:0.063363 |  Played though back for Croatia.
[428.00 - 432.00] P:1906.47 E:0.078874 |  That was Joranovic, the right back, the Celtic defender.
[432.00 - 436.00] P:1746.89 E:0.072736 |  Sometimes you can get in danger of getting caught up inside the World Cup bubble.
[437.00 - 442.00] P:1751.35 E:0.071675 |  Here in Qatar, and you can forget that the FA Cup is continuing.
[442.00 - 444.00] P:1803.23 E:0.094119 |  The second round today has been more ties.
[444.00 - 447.00] P:1822.64 E:0.083452 |  Ebb's fleet united, Neal Fleetwood, Town One.
[447.00 - 449.00] P:1859.37 E:0.082381 |  Bristol Rovers, Neal, Bournemouth, two.
[449.00 - 452.00] P:1867.27 E:0.079976 |  Burton Alby in six, Chippendham, Town One.
[452.00 - 453.00] P:1688.48 E:0.102989 |  They are results.
[453.00 - 456.00] P:1925.13 E:0.078439 |  A latest score in half-time Newport County lead,
[456.00 - 458.00] P:1856.97 E:0.073568 |  Derby County by a goal to Neal,
[458.00 - 460.00] P:1972.54 E:0.084260 |  and on Sports Extra from five,
[460.00 - 463.00] P:1819.86 E:0.079752 |  there will be Ipswich Town against Buxton.
[463.00 - 465.00] P:1814.62 E:0.079641 |  That is a five-o-clock kickoff.
[465.00 - 468.00] P:1811.27 E:0.070093 |  You can hear that on Five Lives Sports Extra.
[470.00 - 472.00] P:1812.75 E:0.088642 |  But it's just a reminder of this,
[472.00 - 477.00] P:1664.89 E:0.076270 |  at times, an insane season with the World Cup right back in the middle.
[477.00 - 479.00] P:1912.68 E:0.095951 |  And the draw tomorrow night, incidentally, for the third round,
[479.00 - 482.00] P:1725.81 E:0.072396 |  will be at seven o'clock on BBC Two.
[482.00 - 485.00] P:1723.79 E:0.074810 |  Kramaric on the right-hand side,
[485.00 - 487.00] P:1698.35 E:0.080209 |  over the halfway line.
[487.00 - 491.00] P:1799.58 E:0.091674 |  He switched play out towards the far side that is headed away by Johnston.
[491.00 - 492.00] P:1945.11 E:0.097796 |  It was.
[492.00 - 494.00] P:1855.58 E:0.096385 |  Buchanan picks it up.
[494.00 - 496.00] P:1716.27 E:0.073496 |  He's running over on that far side.
[496.00 - 501.00] P:1708.07 E:0.082694 |  Buchanan slows down, almost level the penalty area, held up by Moderic.
[501.00 - 503.00] P:1754.82 E:0.068533 |  They lead by a goal to Neal.
[503.00 - 506.00] P:1751.10 E:0.077785 |  Hutchinson tries to join the attack from midfield,
[506.00 - 509.00] P:1755.23 E:0.093479 |  and then the ball is played away by Luca Moderic,
[509.00 - 512.00] P:1601.81 E:0.066240 |  just Canada lead by a goal to Neal.
[514.00 - 520.00] P:1743.51 E:0.075258 |  Attiba Hutchinson, who is the first Canadian player
[520.00 - 521.00] P:1806.23 E:0.092016 |  to reach an essential cap.
[521.00 - 522.00] P:1909.12 E:0.101806 |  The ball plays through.
[522.00 - 523.00] P:1995.57 E:0.097324 |  Flag stays down.
[523.00 - 525.00] P:1915.53 E:0.092405 |  Opportunity here for Laren.
[525.00 - 527.00] P:1820.51 E:0.090360 |  Very good challenge by Gavardiol to come in.
[527.00 - 528.00] P:1893.17 E:0.090579 |  It was a late flag.
[528.00 - 530.00] P:1897.82 E:0.093027 |  He did look offside to be fair to him.
[530.00 - 532.00] P:1750.21 E:0.068774 |  And it will be a free kick to Croatia.
[532.00 - 534.00] P:1753.20 E:0.105655 |  Yeah, offside, but really good tackle.
[534.00 - 538.00] P:1627.92 E:0.073703 |  Gavardiol, really solid centre-back defending.
[538.00 - 541.00] P:1707.81 E:0.082728 |  But I'm more concerned about the space in front of the back four.
[541.00 - 544.00] P:1657.61 E:0.080216 |  I mean, Croatia have to sort it out quickly.
[544.00 - 549.00] P:1736.23 E:0.082495 |  There's just so much gap between the midfield and the Croatian back four.
[549.00 - 552.00] P:1688.66 E:0.083090 |  It's not even having to be worked through cleverly.
[552.00 - 553.00] P:1741.19 E:0.058908 |  The ball can just knock down.
[553.00 - 555.00] P:1700.63 E:0.089839 |  It could just be a simple pass,
[555.00 - 558.00] P:1689.05 E:0.084022 |  and Davies is turning and just running at the back four,
[558.00 - 559.00] P:1657.02 E:0.095145 |  sliding passes.
[559.00 - 562.00] P:1664.89 E:0.068021 |  It's a really shaky start from Croatia.
[562.00 - 565.00] P:1755.69 E:0.070239 |  Croatia coming forward.
[566.00 - 570.00] P:1809.48 E:0.079495 |  Brozovic, out it goes to Perisic.
[570.00 - 571.00] P:1761.05 E:0.087774 |  There's a little step over,
[571.00 - 574.00] P:1847.78 E:0.082453 |  sends over across from the left, too deep.
[574.00 - 576.00] P:1820.35 E:0.096694 |  Moderic will retrieve it on this right-hand side,
[576.00 - 578.00] P:1909.33 E:0.097391 |  already trailing by a goal to Neal.
[578.00 - 579.00] P:1972.83 E:0.096607 |  The return ball, though,
[579.00 - 580.00] P:1927.54 E:0.078873 |  Moderic wasn't expecting that,
[580.00 - 582.00] P:1802.98 E:0.082474 |  and it's going to run out of play for a goal kick.
[582.00 - 584.00] P:1803.70 E:0.093045 |  Canada lead by a goal to Neal.
[584.00 - 586.00] P:1912.42 E:0.083465 |  So, Tiva Hutchison at 39.
[586.00 - 590.00] P:1827.44 E:0.082011 |  He became the second oldest outfielder ever to appear
[590.00 - 591.00] P:1659.25 E:0.077112 |  at a World Cup.
[591.00 - 596.00] P:1803.93 E:0.092026 |  Roger Miller at 42 holds that record back in 1994.
[596.00 - 599.00] P:1841.51 E:0.078544 |  It's interesting, though, that Team Canada,
[599.00 - 603.00] P:1694.44 E:0.079660 |  well, FIFA don't recognise the games against Guadalupe and Martinique.
[603.00 - 607.00] P:1803.49 E:0.083732 |  So, whilst Team Canada are saying that he is their first centurion,
[607.00 - 609.00] P:1604.37 E:0.082533 |  by playing here today,
[609.00 - 613.00] P:1678.18 E:0.074070 |  FIFA actually still have him as this is his 98th game,
[613.00 - 615.00] P:1891.66 E:0.095354 |  as far as FIFA records are concerned.
[615.00 - 618.00] P:1886.01 E:0.091080 |  But it's still a milestone for somebody who made his debut
[618.00 - 622.00] P:1799.80 E:0.081685 |  against the United States 19 years ago.
[622.00 - 624.00] P:1825.30 E:0.083002 |  And here he is, the captain,
[624.00 - 627.00] P:1790.75 E:0.082334 |  getting the ball back from the porto midfielder,
[627.00 - 630.00] P:1756.00 E:0.067406 |  Estiqui, now it's played forward,
[630.00 - 633.00] P:1873.36 E:0.087661 |  and, Jen, it was just tried to be helped on by Alfonso Davis,
[633.00 - 636.00] P:1875.26 E:0.082154 |  going a little bit inside to try and create the space
[636.00 - 640.00] P:1830.35 E:0.074160 |  for LaRia on this left-hand side for Canada, all in black.
[640.00 - 641.00] P:1559.52 E:0.082337 |  Out it goes.
[641.00 - 644.00] P:1932.65 E:0.086241 |  Perisic running forward once more, goes towards the by-line,
[644.00 - 647.00] P:1941.78 E:0.087548 |  at pace, whips over the cross, takes a deflection behind
[647.00 - 648.00] P:1851.97 E:0.090529 |  for a corner kick.
[648.00 - 649.00] P:1862.15 E:0.075330 |  Canada, the lead.
[649.00 - 651.00] P:1793.20 E:0.086354 |  That's much better from Croatia.
[651.00 - 655.00] P:1783.20 E:0.081662 |  Perisic direct on the run, doing what he does well
[655.00 - 657.00] P:1856.13 E:0.092708 |  in terms of the little step over,
[657.00 - 660.00] P:1561.18 E:0.075823 |  keeping his run down the channel and onto his left foot.
[660.00 - 663.00] P:1610.73 E:0.086635 |  Needy Johnston, who's playing it right back today,
[663.00 - 664.00] P:1572.21 E:0.049446 |  to be really alive.
[664.00 - 667.00] P:1725.06 E:0.095769 |  But, I mean, it's a bit of a shake-up in the front three.
[667.00 - 670.00] P:1604.22 E:0.087359 |  They've brought Livia in, who's playing down the middle today,
[670.00 - 672.00] P:1603.65 E:0.095177 |  and Kramaric has gone out to the right-hand side,
[672.00 - 675.00] P:1528.44 E:0.078284 |  but we need to see a bit more of a goal threat
[675.00 - 677.00] P:1575.26 E:0.076818 |  from this Croatian side.
[677.00 - 680.00] P:1780.72 E:0.082927 |  Well, it is a corner kick to Croatia.
[680.00 - 681.00] P:1561.20 E:0.055202 |  Far side to the left.
[681.00 - 683.00] P:1842.34 E:0.091815 |  We've been playing for just over 10 minutes,
[683.00 - 685.00] P:2026.63 E:0.102120 |  you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live.
[687.00 - 690.00] P:1639.41 E:0.075411 |  Kramaric makes the run, played to his feet,
[690.00 - 693.00] P:1895.27 E:0.084845 |  laid back towards Modric, left-hand side of the penalty area,
[693.00 - 696.00] P:1951.56 E:0.075939 |  down towards the byline, clips over the cross,
[696.00 - 699.00] P:1867.58 E:0.087065 |  headed away by Estaki, picked up by Modric once again.
[699.00 - 702.00] P:1902.77 E:0.087943 |  Hutchinson was there to stab it away for Canada.
[702.00 - 705.00] P:1683.63 E:0.074643 |  Can the break be on here? No, held up.
[705.00 - 708.00] P:1807.09 E:0.092513 |  Vaughn eventually played out towards that far side,
[708.00 - 709.00] P:1859.54 E:0.075811 |  where the cross comes in,
[709.00 - 712.00] P:1918.29 E:0.069176 |  and that was Estaki's slice clearance,
[712.00 - 714.00] P:1803.81 E:0.102415 |  and it will go out of play for a throw
[714.00 - 716.00] P:1844.00 E:0.082044 |  right down by the corner flag.
[716.00 - 718.00] P:1545.10 E:0.087306 |  A little bit wild that from Estaki.
[718.00 - 720.00] P:1598.98 E:0.078873 |  He had a little bit of time on the edge of the box.
[720.00 - 722.00] P:1648.76 E:0.080481 |  It was a right foot, he swiped the ball,
[722.00 - 725.00] P:1727.93 E:0.081193 |  he really tries to put too much power on the clearance
[725.00 - 728.00] P:1830.42 E:0.076519 |  and just kind of slices it up in the air.
[728.00 - 732.00] P:1751.28 E:0.075372 |  Very nearly goes out for a corner, but throw in with Perisic.
[734.00 - 738.00] P:1862.14 E:0.086143 |  He's going to wait to take the throw on that far side to the left.
[739.00 - 741.00] P:1698.06 E:0.084907 |  In comes the long one.
[742.00 - 746.00] P:1692.57 E:0.092930 |  Comes into the penalty area, Kramaric's there.
[747.00 - 751.00] P:1876.19 E:0.091882 |  Davies, the goal scorer, manages to get the ball away.
[751.00 - 754.00] P:1698.70 E:0.077704 |  And then it's played forward by David,
[754.00 - 756.00] P:1834.37 E:0.079802 |  but Laryn wasn't prepared to chase it,
[756.00 - 759.00] P:1685.27 E:0.079456 |  and Gavadio will just drop back and now Lovren.
[760.00 - 765.00] P:1861.57 E:0.092048 |  Just inside his own half, another raking ball out towards that left-hand side.
[765.00 - 766.00] P:1957.25 E:0.067537 |  The first touch from Perisic,
[766.00 - 769.00] P:1889.79 E:0.077077 |  she's to try and take it away from Johnston.
[769.00 - 774.00] P:1898.39 E:0.086524 |  So he likes to be flexible with his tactics, John Herdman.
[774.00 - 776.00] P:1827.89 E:0.086720 |  We saw him with the three in the opening game,
[776.00 - 779.00] P:1849.73 E:0.074985 |  and as you quite rightly say, Matt Upson,
[779.00 - 781.00] P:1771.00 E:0.081034 |  he's gone to a flat back four.
[781.00 - 785.00] P:1541.86 E:0.076647 |  Interesting, isn't it? After having real success in the first game,
[785.00 - 788.00] P:1585.01 E:0.088153 |  the way they played, I love the link up down the right-hand side
[788.00 - 790.00] P:1590.90 E:0.085516 |  between Johnston, Laryn and Buchanan,
[790.00 - 794.00] P:1546.22 E:0.074963 |  I thought they really worked together in something a little bit different.
[795.00 - 800.00] P:1783.89 E:0.084050 |  Here is Moderic, Estiqui with a challenge midway through his own half.
[800.00 - 805.00] P:1843.81 E:0.083812 |  Incidentally, if you like your faxing figures, FIFA have retimed the goal
[805.00 - 808.00] P:1567.02 E:0.050802 |  and they've changed it by a second.
[808.00 - 811.00] P:1729.51 E:0.074072 |  Instead of 68 seconds, it's now 67.
[811.00 - 813.00] P:1550.09 E:0.071172 |  That will take some beating.
[815.00 - 818.00] P:1423.07 E:0.088574 |  What? The attention to detail all the time?
[818.00 - 820.00] P:1687.34 E:0.070703 |  At this World Cup.
[821.00 - 823.00] P:1533.65 E:0.079228 |  For the quickest goal.
[823.00 - 827.00] P:1617.65 E:0.071748 |  It was a great, great header, and what a moment as well for the player.
[827.00 - 828.00] P:1667.17 E:0.102944 |  Look at that again.
[828.00 - 830.00] P:1281.77 E:0.082194 |  See the space that is dropping in there.
[831.00 - 836.00] P:1654.01 E:0.085548 |  Just so easy, the middle of the park for Croatia is just wide open.
[836.00 - 840.00] P:1680.69 E:0.086358 |  If Canada can get any ball breaking a line from the centre back,
[840.00 - 844.00] P:1702.74 E:0.077530 |  firing it into a midfielder and attacking player that's dropped in that pocket,
[844.00 - 847.00] P:1713.46 E:0.083613 |  they turn and they're running into 20 yards of space.
[847.00 - 850.00] P:1835.62 E:0.075749 |  I mean, the pitch is just so open.
[852.00 - 854.00] P:1804.28 E:0.105418 |  The Croatian support away towards our left.
[854.00 - 859.00] P:1808.89 E:0.082629 |  Try to give the Croatian players a bit of vocal encouragement.
[859.00 - 862.00] P:1794.73 E:0.073153 |  There are pockets of Croatian supporters.
[862.00 - 867.00] P:1704.26 E:0.077692 |  Also over on that far side, always travelling great numbers.
[867.00 - 870.00] P:1881.12 E:0.077707 |  But it's been a disappointing tournament so far.
[870.00 - 873.00] P:1858.23 E:0.054234 |  Here is Alistair Johnston.
[873.00 - 876.00] P:1744.37 E:0.073162 |  Notice he's been linked with Celtic.
[876.00 - 881.00] P:1683.79 E:0.078185 |  Lariat forward on this near side, the left corner of the area, plays it back.
[881.00 - 884.00] P:1813.49 E:0.083539 |  A little bit behind the goalscorer Davies.
[884.00 - 886.00] P:1632.08 E:0.063679 |  Played back now to Laren.
[886.00 - 889.00] P:1796.90 E:0.088693 |  Laren's right footed cross, making the run in towards the penalty area,
[889.00 - 891.00] P:1705.81 E:0.097299 |  was Davies himself.
[891.00 - 896.00] P:1606.74 E:0.076065 |  And then there was a little bit of a trip there on Kovacic.
[896.00 - 898.00] P:1727.59 E:0.076059 |  And that will be a free kick.
[898.00 - 901.00] P:1685.53 E:0.075739 |  But you're right, they are finding pockets of space.
[901.00 - 902.00] P:1663.99 E:0.083957 |  Oh, it's too easy.
[902.00 - 905.00] P:1511.75 E:0.078069 |  I mean, Kovacic is going to have to have a blinding game today.
[905.00 - 908.00] P:1531.89 E:0.090341 |  He's that energy and engine in that midfield.
[908.00 - 911.00] P:1555.92 E:0.085804 |  He's going to have to cover a lot of ground from the start of this match.
[911.00 - 915.00] P:1620.91 E:0.088174 |  But I've just been impressed by the start of Canada.
[915.00 - 918.00] P:1662.96 E:0.084919 |  Sometimes it's hard when you score that early, though, Denner.
[918.00 - 919.00] P:1491.10 E:0.110403 |  You know what I mean?
[919.00 - 920.00] P:1791.82 E:0.071643 |  It's very early on.
[920.00 - 923.00] P:1640.90 E:0.087289 |  You can't get into that mindset of, right, we're a goal ahead,
[923.00 - 925.00] P:1573.52 E:0.088269 |  less now, start to be more defences.
[925.00 - 929.00] P:1734.98 E:0.090439 |  I'm sure the message coming on, looking at John Herdman in that tactical area,
[929.00 - 932.00] P:1680.36 E:0.081302 |  he doesn't appear to be changing his messages.
[932.00 - 936.00] P:1677.57 E:0.090206 |  Get out on the front foot, get pressure, keep probing, get another goal,
[936.00 - 938.00] P:1726.34 E:0.065344 |  and just keep taking this game forwards.
[938.00 - 942.00] P:1815.59 E:0.076921 |  Modric Brozovic challenged by David.
[942.00 - 945.00] P:1824.76 E:0.090307 |  Out of play, it goes for a throw to Croatia.
[945.00 - 950.00] P:1934.62 E:0.080553 |  Joranovic will want to take it just in front of his coach, Zlatko Dalic,
[950.00 - 954.00] P:1962.32 E:0.081297 |  who's standing up in that very large technical area down below here
[954.00 - 957.00] P:1867.07 E:0.076388 |  at this Khalifa International Stadium.
[957.00 - 961.00] P:1796.53 E:0.084435 |  And now Kramaric inside, little flick header by Brozovic,
[961.00 - 967.00] P:1825.08 E:0.078082 |  turned back and eventually it was Steven Vittoria to get the ball away under pressure.
[967.00 - 970.00] P:1756.21 E:0.078783 |  And out it goes for a throw over on that far side.
[970.00 - 973.00] P:1922.37 E:0.096008 |  They're just starting to see a little bit more of the ball, Croatia,
[973.00 - 978.00] P:1737.13 E:0.070458 |  as they look for an equaliser, 16 minutes into this contest here.
[978.00 - 984.00] P:1519.03 E:0.063647 |  Lovren, former Southampton and Liverpool defender, plays it forward.
[984.00 - 991.00] P:1707.92 E:0.072552 |  Kovacic of Chelsea, out it goes now to Gvadio, runs forward, far side the left,
[991.00 - 996.00] P:1651.81 E:0.059735 |  midway through the Canada half, Sosa is ahead of him.
[996.00 - 1001.00] P:1728.52 E:0.076317 |  Reminds me of Jonathan Woodgate from his days back at Real Madrid.
[1001.00 - 1006.00] P:1740.07 E:0.083805 |  Sosa with the Alice Band and the long hair, if you can remember that far back, Matt.
[1006.00 - 1008.00] P:1503.46 E:0.053730 |  I remember it well.
[1008.00 - 1013.00] P:1796.74 E:0.087328 |  And here he is once again, Sosa with the cross, dropping inside the penalty area,
[1013.00 - 1016.00] P:1801.27 E:0.091736 |  fisted down two-handed by the goalkeeper, Bojan.
[1016.00 - 1019.00] P:1958.25 E:0.096648 |  Ball played into the penalty area for Peristic, who goes down.
[1019.00 - 1024.00] P:1650.51 E:0.073807 |  And it will be, if anything, a free kick to Canada as the ball runs out,
[1024.00 - 1029.00] P:1747.26 E:0.081160 |  harmlessly out of play, but it'll be a free kick to Canada, who lead by a goal to Nill.
[1029.00 - 1033.00] P:1693.86 E:0.082618 |  I think they've just got to be careful, Canada, that they keep focus, keep concentration.
[1033.00 - 1038.00] P:1629.96 E:0.080894 |  They're in that back four, which can be quite helpful sometimes in terms of knowing your role,
[1038.00 - 1040.00] P:1677.27 E:0.078338 |  understanding the space.
[1040.00 - 1043.00] P:1649.13 E:0.089356 |  You've got your centre-back partnership, he's gone with Vittoria and Miller.
[1043.00 - 1047.00] P:1786.20 E:0.080239 |  Vittoria very experienced centre-back, 35-year-old.
[1047.00 - 1051.00] P:1465.41 E:0.083607 |  So I think he'll be very vocal in organising that, and it's a bold move really,
[1051.00 - 1056.00] P:1660.71 E:0.073008 |  because, you know, Croatia, very much a front three, and I think he just fancies
[1056.00 - 1060.00] P:1477.92 E:0.079895 |  the fact that his full-backs can deal with their wide players,
[1060.00 - 1063.00] P:1537.53 E:0.076830 |  Peristic and Kramaric today.
[1063.00 - 1065.00] P:1330.50 E:0.070571 |  And that is the gamble really.
[1065.00 - 1069.00] P:1464.28 E:0.087162 |  Can your full-backs deal with those attacking players and handle those 1v1 duels?
[1069.00 - 1071.00] P:1705.62 E:0.067882 |  A bold move for mankind.
[1071.00 - 1073.00] P:1720.78 E:0.095887 |  It wasn't that astronaut.
[1073.00 - 1074.00] P:1846.04 E:0.102357 |  Fascinating.
[1074.00 - 1078.00] P:1611.44 E:0.084026 |  It was. It was, and it was great to hear how he linked his experience into football.
[1078.00 - 1082.00] P:1781.72 E:0.089087 |  Buchanan comes inside, plays the ball forward towards Larin.
[1082.00 - 1084.00] P:1880.50 E:0.084090 |  The return ball won't quite come off.
[1084.00 - 1087.00] P:1774.87 E:0.083516 |  If you haven't downloaded yet the BBC Sounds app,
[1087.00 - 1093.00] P:1811.00 E:0.085974 |  you've got the facility on that to rewind to any programme on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[1093.00 - 1097.00] P:1850.66 E:0.075040 |  If you were to go back to it just before 3.30,
[1097.00 - 1100.00] P:1802.48 E:0.089076 |  hopefully we don't lose you during the commentary, maybe do it at halftime,
[1100.00 - 1105.00] P:1847.08 E:0.083177 |  but Chris Hatfield, this astronaut, was absolutely fascinating the way he was talking
[1105.00 - 1108.00] P:1713.22 E:0.086508 |  about how he'd given a pep talk to the Canadian players.
[1108.00 - 1113.00] P:1830.22 E:0.081865 |  So it was around 3.30 on 5.Live, and BBC Sounds would certainly give you the opportunity to do that.
[1114.00 - 1117.00] P:1786.54 E:0.082177 |  Is that just because you asked a good question?
[1117.00 - 1118.00] P:1803.14 E:0.110364 |  He did seem to like it.
[1118.00 - 1119.00] P:1756.38 E:0.083671 |  It was a good question.
[1119.00 - 1125.00] P:1770.22 E:0.075155 |  Here is Hutchinson to Larin, lays it off, Buchanan, 30 yards out from goal,
[1125.00 - 1127.00] P:1755.47 E:0.089994 |  crosses into the penalty area.
[1127.00 - 1130.00] P:1928.58 E:0.089774 |  Jovanovich didn't know where Jonathan David was,
[1130.00 - 1132.00] P:1902.24 E:0.095170 |  and David actually wasn't putting him under any pressure,
[1132.00 - 1135.00] P:1875.93 E:0.088587 |  but Jovanovich is headed the ball behind, he's conceded the corner,
[1135.00 - 1136.00] P:1873.07 E:0.095150 |  Canada lead 1-0.
[1136.00 - 1139.00] P:1513.77 E:0.080594 |  Yeah, if you're in doubt, head it out, and that's exactly what Jovanovich did.
[1139.00 - 1141.00] P:1700.37 E:0.078959 |  He couldn't take a chance.
[1141.00 - 1146.00] P:1664.13 E:0.076059 |  David put the brakes on, he wasn't going towards that far post,
[1146.00 - 1150.00] P:1672.56 E:0.085982 |  but it's alarming how easy it is for the Canadian midfield players.
[1150.00 - 1152.00] P:1688.07 E:0.097797 |  Just to put their foot on the ball, get their head up,
[1152.00 - 1155.00] P:1764.77 E:0.086198 |  and chip one in the box, there's no pressure at all.
[1155.00 - 1159.00] P:1757.50 E:0.071011 |  Corner's been taken short, Millers up from the back,
[1159.00 - 1161.00] P:1825.79 E:0.091914 |  hasn't been properly dealt with at the first time of asking,
[1161.00 - 1169.00] P:1686.59 E:0.075987 |  and then dropping to one knee, clattered away by Gavardiol at the back there for Croatia,
[1169.00 - 1173.00] P:1794.43 E:0.078008 |  and then Canada all the way back to where to boyan,
[1173.00 - 1178.00] P:1624.27 E:0.075320 |  and we're in the 20th minute, and Canada are leading by a goal to nil.
[1180.00 - 1187.00] P:1607.01 E:0.066124 |  Miller, forward ball, David just inside the Croatia half,
[1187.00 - 1192.00] P:1694.48 E:0.080766 |  keeping the ball very well, playing confident football here, Canada,
[1192.00 - 1196.00] P:1758.16 E:0.084100 |  utilising the width, but they've lost it now over on that far side
[1196.00 - 1199.00] P:1872.23 E:0.081205 |  with the intersection from Sosa, who continues his run.
[1199.00 - 1204.00] P:1803.21 E:0.079143 |  His high cross, Kramaric with the cushion header into the path of Moderic,
[1204.00 - 1208.00] P:1920.93 E:0.092194 |  and he just tried to take it away, I think it was from Estaki,
[1208.00 - 1213.00] P:1895.54 E:0.095663 |  but all of a sudden it's been cleared, and now Davies, the goal scorer, is away,
[1213.00 - 1217.00] P:1919.79 E:0.099946 |  up against Jovanovich, Alfonso Davies with a low ball into the penalty area,
[1217.00 - 1222.00] P:1681.43 E:0.079536 |  he couldn't quite pick out Kyle Laring, and there was Gavardiol at the back once again,
[1222.00 - 1225.00] P:1731.22 E:0.095166 |  and now Brozovic will bring the ball away, and at the minute it's quite end-to-end.
[1225.00 - 1228.00] P:1610.03 E:0.088786 |  Yeah, I mean, it's a real mistake from Jovanovich, the right back,
[1228.00 - 1232.00] P:1651.21 E:0.077166 |  just tried to hook the ball back over his head, swung his leg at it,
[1232.00 - 1238.00] P:1503.09 E:0.067500 |  I mean, missed the ball completely, just about sums up the start for Croatia for me.
[1238.00 - 1243.00] P:1797.18 E:0.092376 |  Brozovic midway through the Canada half, he's given it away to Hutchinson,
[1243.00 - 1250.00] P:1814.08 E:0.083521 |  walking pace is Kovacic, invites Lovren to come forward in the centre-circle of the Canada half,
[1250.00 - 1256.00] P:1598.36 E:0.071617 |  every black shirt back behind the ball, full-backs pushed on to central defenders,
[1256.00 - 1260.00] P:1713.46 E:0.091543 |  seeing a little bit of the ball at the moment, Brozovic is the defensive midfielder
[1260.00 - 1264.00] P:1590.13 E:0.092273 |  at the minute for Croatia back towards Lovren, not a great deal of movement,
[1264.00 - 1271.00] P:1741.32 E:0.088146 |  has to go out wide right to Jovanovich, his forward ball, Kramaric midway through the Canada half,
[1271.00 - 1276.00] P:1766.09 E:0.071427 |  Lovren unchallenged forward ball, Brozovic now takes over,
[1276.00 - 1281.00] P:1828.01 E:0.080228 |  Modric passes the ball to Gvardjol, able to take the ball off his left foot,
[1281.00 - 1286.00] P:1843.20 E:0.088305 |  passes the ball out towards the far side of the left, Perisic has gone into a central area,
[1286.00 - 1290.00] P:1750.84 E:0.086032 |  Cross comes in now, easily headed away by Kamal Miller,
[1290.00 - 1294.00] P:1826.20 E:0.084873 |  able to turn off the chest in one swift movement by David,
[1294.00 - 1299.00] P:1696.68 E:0.074201 |  and he tried to volley the ball forward to Laren, the interception from Croatia.
[1299.00 - 1305.00] P:1878.69 E:0.089213 |  Kovacic accelerates, runs forward, edge of the penalty area and an outstretched boot.
[1306.00 - 1312.00] P:1939.95 E:0.085461 |  Kramaric, Kramaric, Lovren, and he just couldn't get on the end of it and it runs through to Bojan.
[1312.00 - 1319.00] P:1686.16 E:0.076036 |  Brilliant turn of acceleration from Kovacic, I mean he didn't have to do too much to break through that line,
[1319.00 - 1324.00] P:1551.19 E:0.077340 |  and for the first time in this game, Canada looking a little bit vulnerable in a similar fashion
[1324.00 - 1330.00] P:1580.59 E:0.081464 |  to how Croatia have looked in this game so far, and just a slight toe on the ball from Livia,
[1330.00 - 1334.00] P:1624.82 E:0.079107 |  couldn't get enough contact on it to steer it past the goalkeeper,
[1334.00 - 1339.00] P:1464.54 E:0.073194 |  but nice burst of pace from Kovacic, just let them know that he's in the game,
[1339.00 - 1343.00] P:1576.45 E:0.083335 |  and if you want to stand off and give that much space, there's a lot of space in the middle,
[1343.00 - 1348.00] P:1482.72 E:0.081559 |  both teams are allowing quite a bit of distance, it's not a condensed pitch at all,
[1348.00 - 1351.00] P:1443.25 E:0.081975 |  so I think we could see plenty of opportunities in this game.
[1351.00 - 1357.00] P:1827.25 E:0.095497 |  That's the insightful Matthew Uxson, the former England international defender who's with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live,
[1357.00 - 1366.00] P:1792.71 E:0.079630 |  where Canada lead by a goal to nil, a goal after just 67 seconds from this man, Alfonso Davies,
[1366.00 - 1372.00] P:1885.75 E:0.095602 |  who's forward of the centre circle, gets away from Kovacic, the forward ball, Gavadio with the interception,
[1372.00 - 1375.00] P:1850.42 E:0.096758 |  ball played forward then by the right back, Alistair Johnston,
[1375.00 - 1379.00] P:1866.78 E:0.078085 |  and once again they are committing men forward, Canada,
[1379.00 - 1384.00] P:1765.92 E:0.083650 |  they really, I really enjoyed the game against Belgium the other night when I was watching the television,
[1384.00 - 1386.00] P:1752.90 E:0.075824 |  the way that they played.
[1386.00 - 1391.00] P:1518.89 E:0.073922 |  Yeah, I mean, it's nice to see Davies in a slightly different position as well,
[1391.00 - 1396.00] P:1585.71 E:0.085614 |  because he plays that win back, there's a real lot of defensive work you have to get through,
[1396.00 - 1401.00] P:1580.68 E:0.091481 |  and you've just seen him, little clips snippet of him there, how good his feet are, how well he can go past players,
[1401.00 - 1405.00] P:1419.12 E:0.085463 |  I think that's the exciting thing that he should bring to this Canada team, he's doing it in this game.
[1405.00 - 1411.00] P:1786.19 E:0.082334 |  Uxson, a little tussle there with Modric, breaks back towards Davies, he passes the ball to Estiqui,
[1411.00 - 1414.00] P:1787.87 E:0.087410 |  now out to La Ria, back towards Davies once more,
[1414.00 - 1419.00] P:1770.15 E:0.070717 |  challenge comes in from that midfield duo of Modric and Brozovic,
[1419.00 - 1425.00] P:1747.80 E:0.078943 |  they both went into the same ball, but Canada still retain the ball, out it goes now towards Buchanan,
[1425.00 - 1428.00] P:1700.79 E:0.096595 |  just flashes his right leg around the ball without making the contact,
[1428.00 - 1433.00] P:1703.59 E:0.081078 |  then the cross comes in from the right back, Johnston, goes out from where it came,
[1433.00 - 1439.00] P:1806.98 E:0.083048 |  Johnston's header taken well off the chest there by Buchanan, tries to play the ball back towards Johnston,
[1439.00 - 1444.00] P:1809.69 E:0.085808 |  Canada really have got plenty of, must be six, seven black shirts in and around the penalty area,
[1444.00 - 1449.00] P:1893.60 E:0.091811 |  really making life awkward for Croatia, when they had it momentarily they've lost it,
[1449.00 - 1453.00] P:1766.70 E:0.071482 |  the ball is spread out now to La Ria on this near side,
[1453.00 - 1457.00] P:1806.30 E:0.085729 |  Joranovic shows him on the outside, La Ria will try and get there,
[1457.00 - 1460.00] P:1807.73 E:0.078335 |  Joranovic then makes a challenge, out of play it goes for a throw.
[1460.00 - 1464.00] P:1719.82 E:0.088588 |  A bit better from Joranovic, got tighter, bit more intensity in the tackle,
[1464.00 - 1467.00] P:1695.45 E:0.080735 |  not seeing enough of that from Croatia, out of possession,
[1467.00 - 1472.00] P:1724.26 E:0.084758 |  a little bit coasting round the pitch and just filling holes and not actually getting close enough to a black shirt.
[1474.00 - 1480.00] P:1783.71 E:0.081381 |  Canada with the throw, La Ria to take it on this near side, looked a foul throw,
[1480.00 - 1484.00] P:1618.22 E:0.068888 |  and it was a foul throw from La Ria.
[1484.00 - 1490.00] P:1844.46 E:0.085674 |  Reminder tomorrow, it's the final day of morning action actually on BBC Radio 5 Live, 10 o'clock,
[1490.00 - 1494.00] P:1759.24 E:0.077924 |  the Vildapul start as always at 9 o'clock, Cameroon Serbia at 10,
[1494.00 - 1499.00] P:1843.56 E:0.090937 |  we then got South Korea, Ghana at 1 in group H, then we go back to group G for Brazil,
[1499.00 - 1506.00] P:1799.46 E:0.079116 |  the game's Switzerland at 4 and Portugal, Uruguay rounds off tomorrow's action at 7 o'clock,
[1506.00 - 1512.00] P:1727.44 E:0.068218 |  so four more games for you on 5 Live and BBC Sounds.
[1512.00 - 1518.00] P:1601.46 E:0.069202 |  Croatia still trailing here by a goal to nil and cleared,
[1518.00 - 1525.00] P:1604.86 E:0.080156 |  long and out of play over on that side by Vittoria, the tall lean central defender,
[1525.00 - 1533.00] P:1540.45 E:0.075500 |  but Croatia haven't really caused Canada too many problems in these opening 25 minutes.
[1533.00 - 1535.00] P:1432.30 E:0.070806 |  Are you surprised?
[1535.00 - 1537.00] P:1484.19 E:0.062949 |  A little.
[1537.00 - 1538.00] P:1569.85 E:0.069915 |  Are you?
[1538.00 - 1539.00] P:1559.88 E:0.092436 |  Are you not?
[1539.00 - 1543.00] P:1474.99 E:0.090816 |  No, I watched Croatia in their last game and they didn't play with much intensity,
[1543.00 - 1546.00] P:1599.49 E:0.093430 |  and that's the part of this game that could be a problem for them.
[1546.00 - 1550.00] P:1926.09 E:0.100652 |  Lvivaja to Kramaric, takes it into the penalty area, does he get a sight of goal?
[1550.00 - 1556.00] P:1986.23 E:0.110045 |  Yes, he does, but the flag goes up, right footed, guides the ball into the left-hand side of the net,
[1556.00 - 1561.00] P:1960.87 E:0.103425 |  but his joy is short-lived as he wheeled away towards the right,
[1561.00 - 1565.00] P:1922.13 E:0.091487 |  he was faced with a crushing sense of disappointment that the flag was up,
[1565.00 - 1571.00] P:1771.71 E:0.073407 |  and of course will be checked, but the flag was immediate,
[1572.00 - 1578.00] P:1872.85 E:0.094607 |  and it looks like the ball to Lvivaja was, he was offside, not the return ball to Kramaric.
[1578.00 - 1582.00] P:1608.69 E:0.088568 |  No, it's the initial ball through to Lvivaja, he's about half a yard offside,
[1582.00 - 1588.00] P:1703.12 E:0.087994 |  his little one touch into Kramaric was good, and that's the first time I've seen Kramaric move with any real intensity,
[1588.00 - 1597.00] P:1687.19 E:0.079431 |  dropped to shoulder, fainted to go one way, then burst in behind, really nice link-up play as well from Lvivaja,
[1597.00 - 1602.00] P:1776.62 E:0.078664 |  it's just a shame that he crept half a yard offside before the ball came to him,
[1602.00 - 1609.00] P:1629.07 E:0.082984 |  otherwise that had been a really well-worked goal, and the first little movement of link-up play with Sim from Croatia,
[1609.00 - 1612.00] P:1506.90 E:0.064934 |  it was pretty convincing I have to say.
[1612.00 - 1615.00] P:1769.68 E:0.095669 |  It was an excellent decision from the assistant referee as well,
[1615.00 - 1620.00] P:1822.84 E:0.087606 |  at times you've seen sometimes that we might leave it for the VAR, but...
[1620.00 - 1626.00] P:1734.02 E:0.082809 |  He put it up early didn't he? As soon as Kramaric peeled away to his right, he just saw the flag raised,
[1626.00 - 1628.00] P:1672.41 E:0.040088 |  and he was the last.
[1628.00 - 1632.00] P:1722.29 E:0.082021 |  Sometimes as well at this World Cup, you get a referee from one country,
[1632.00 - 1635.00] P:1806.56 E:0.090472 |  and an assistant referee from another, and the fourth official from another,
[1635.00 - 1642.00] P:1818.81 E:0.085077 |  and the other assistant referee from the other, but it's the Uruguayan team that is supporting Andre Matonte here today,
[1642.00 - 1647.00] P:1786.56 E:0.092021 |  who's only 34 years of age, that was a good decision, and Canada still lead by a goal to Nile,
[1647.00 - 1655.00] P:1880.25 E:0.085071 |  that goal was ruled out for Croatia, Modric, out to Kramaric,
[1655.00 - 1658.00] P:1827.97 E:0.107917 |  and he's coming out towards this right-hand side, he's over the halfway line,
[1658.00 - 1663.00] P:1705.86 E:0.072892 |  they're playing in their white and red tops from left to right, but trailing by a goal to Nile,
[1663.00 - 1668.00] P:1858.86 E:0.068364 |  Lvivaja, quite a stocky centre forward, Perisic.
[1668.00 - 1669.00] P:1735.68 E:0.112907 |  Good tackle that.
[1669.00 - 1673.00] P:1717.79 E:0.072188 |  Tackled by Hutchinson, and cleared long by Buchanan.
[1673.00 - 1677.00] P:1630.75 E:0.087945 |  I think it was... was it Hutchinson or Johnston with that tackle, right back?
[1677.00 - 1681.00] P:1761.75 E:0.090029 |  Brilliant tackle, Perisic just had a slightly too heavy a touch didn't he,
[1681.00 - 1685.00] P:1588.85 E:0.089527 |  the decision he went early went to ground and really won the ball cleanly.
[1685.00 - 1692.00] P:1763.35 E:0.078001 |  He can play right over three, or as he is here tonight as a right back, the Montreal Defender,
[1692.00 - 1698.00] P:1667.23 E:0.071716 |  who didn't necessarily, that'll be a free kick, Lvivaja on Lvivaja,
[1698.00 - 1707.00] P:1807.95 E:0.082782 |  he didn't rule out a move to Celtic, but he featured the most of all the Canadian players in qualifying,
[1707.00 - 1713.00] P:1769.69 E:0.079856 |  but he along with Alfonso Davies are the two players who are on a yellow card,
[1713.00 - 1720.00] P:1812.63 E:0.082202 |  so should they be booked tonight, they would miss what could be such a crucial game against Morocco,
[1720.00 - 1726.00] P:1748.80 E:0.079256 |  whereas if you missed it earlier, Morocco in this group beat Belgium by two goals to Nile,
[1726.00 - 1730.00] P:1755.47 E:0.071223 |  and so they currently sit top of Group F with four points.
[1730.00 - 1736.00] P:1837.95 E:0.079172 |  But if it was to stay like this, you'd have Morocco four, Belgium and Canada on three,
[1736.00 - 1742.00] P:1714.21 E:0.077429 |  and Croatia on one going into the final set of matches next Thursday.
[1742.00 - 1747.00] P:1756.02 E:0.087156 |  But we've only been playing for 29 minutes here in the Khalifa International Stadium,
[1747.00 - 1750.00] P:1622.81 E:0.068954 |  and there is a long, long way to go.
[1750.00 - 1757.00] P:1686.85 E:0.076101 |  As Camar Mila also plays his football at Montreal, back to Boyan the goalkeeper,
[1757.00 - 1763.00] P:1580.16 E:0.049827 |  Hutchinson takes it over, Lariat plays it back,
[1763.00 - 1769.00] P:1759.32 E:0.072558 |  and now dropping back in between the two central defenders is Estiqui to Vittoria.
[1769.00 - 1772.00] P:1766.80 E:0.076493 |  They're working across the back to that far side, they're right.
[1772.00 - 1778.00] P:1785.26 E:0.078252 |  Estiqui takes over, plays it forward, trying to spin away from his man was Jonathan David.
[1778.00 - 1781.00] P:1749.22 E:0.080012 |  No fouls as the referee, it'll be a free kick to Croatia.
[1781.00 - 1784.00] P:1443.00 E:0.083609 |  They've got a lot of pace in their front players, Canada, haven't they?
[1784.00 - 1790.00] P:1477.91 E:0.082756 |  I'm looking at Buchanan, the way he's operating, he looks like he's got the ability to run past people.
[1790.00 - 1793.00] P:1615.38 E:0.077553 |  Alfonso Davies as well, obviously.
[1793.00 - 1799.00] P:1809.27 E:0.089131 |  Croatia on the attack, Buchanan with the challenge, and that will be no foul on Sosa.
[1799.00 - 1804.00] P:1831.88 E:0.088815 |  The left back on that far side, Derby County equalised in the FA Cup second round.
[1804.00 - 1807.00] P:1908.19 E:0.093820 |  Newport County won, Derby County won, it's a latest score.
[1811.00 - 1816.00] P:1799.95 E:0.081232 |  Canada lead, 1-0, Davies, got a blow in the face there,
[1816.00 - 1820.00] P:1875.82 E:0.093713 |  and it was right in front of the referee, Lovren, half an hour played here,
[1820.00 - 1822.00] P:1907.21 E:0.087336 |  Canada still lead 1-0, free kick to Canada.
[1822.00 - 1826.00] P:1723.31 E:0.082260 |  Yeah, I mean, referee couldn't be a better place for that decision, Lovren's not happy,
[1826.00 - 1832.00] P:1696.02 E:0.078497 |  because he's just trying to get his arm across to manoeuvre Davies out of the way.
[1832.00 - 1838.00] P:1729.38 E:0.084940 |  I think his forearms are a little bit high and the elbow just goes on the cheek or on the side of the head.
[1838.00 - 1845.00] P:1518.77 E:0.077411 |  The referee's right on top of it, just sees it, blows for the foul and it's a quite an interesting position.
[1846.00 - 1851.00] P:1675.45 E:0.081998 |  The left foot of Davies looking to whip this one in from the left-hand side,
[1851.00 - 1855.00] P:1648.69 E:0.080230 |  it's a bit of angle on it, it's quite deep and central,
[1855.00 - 1858.00] P:1650.29 E:0.081788 |  and they've got quite a few players forward, Canada.
[1858.00 - 1864.00] P:1838.51 E:0.084524 |  Certainly concerned for Croatia, they've got everybody back in and around the penalty area,
[1864.00 - 1870.00] P:1834.03 E:0.082451 |  just one in the wall that is mod-rich, he's preventing Davies going straight at goal,
[1870.00 - 1875.00] P:1790.06 E:0.085020 |  but it goes, it's a whip ball, actually headed away well under pressure by Lovren,
[1875.00 - 1883.00] P:1701.00 E:0.055619 |  picked back up though by Johnston and now Luria and he checks Lvivajer,
[1883.00 - 1887.00] P:1984.10 E:0.080978 |  the two of them are just having a little bit of a shoving contest in the centre-circle at the minute
[1887.00 - 1890.00] P:1894.04 E:0.083818 |  as he passed the ball all the way back to Bojan.
[1890.00 - 1893.00] P:1843.28 E:0.068918 |  I don't think he was too impressed with the lack of options.
[1893.00 - 1897.00] P:1912.66 E:0.084093 |  Headed forward by Johnston, who stayed out on this left-hand side, the right back.
[1897.00 - 1902.00] P:1811.17 E:0.082381 |  This is David, chips the ball through the middle, Estakir had made that run from midfield,
[1902.00 - 1907.00] P:1884.27 E:0.089156 |  Guardiola with the header down, Kovacic now tries to get it out to Paracic,
[1907.00 - 1910.00] P:1863.87 E:0.084890 |  who just about gets away with it.
[1910.00 - 1919.00] P:1878.05 E:0.076579 |  It was Vitoria who dived in and he only fractionally held up Paracic.
[1919.00 - 1924.00] P:1717.07 E:0.093045 |  Anything could have happened there, that was one of those moments that could have gone well
[1924.00 - 1928.00] P:1652.23 E:0.078625 |  or very badly and it ended up somewhere in between, didn't it?
[1928.00 - 1932.00] P:1652.71 E:0.095729 |  I mean, Vitoria came out and he made a bit of a gamble to get to the ball
[1932.00 - 1936.00] P:1693.58 E:0.079223 |  and luckily the ball just kind of like ricocheted between the two players a little bit
[1936.00 - 1940.00] P:1591.26 E:0.088057 |  and allowed a teammate to get back in and stop that, but that was a really dangerous move
[1940.00 - 1943.00] P:1706.57 E:0.094219 |  and they've got to be careful, they don't push too much forward, Canada.
[1943.00 - 1946.00] P:1587.30 E:0.080762 |  They're starting to commit quite a lot when they're high up the pitch
[1946.00 - 1952.00] P:1748.18 E:0.080525 |  and Croatia have the quality and the vision just to pick you off a little bit into those spaces if you're not careful.
[1952.00 - 1956.00] P:1805.13 E:0.086114 |  I've got to say before that moment, I was surprised that Johnston as a right back
[1956.00 - 1959.00] P:1839.21 E:0.091078 |  was over here on the left-hand side which then vacated the gap.
[1959.00 - 1963.00] P:1473.18 E:0.081927 |  Well, it's things like that that sometimes in terms of the game management, you're one nil up
[1963.00 - 1967.00] P:1537.76 E:0.084080 |  and I know it's early on in the game so you're not trying to hang on to anything
[1967.00 - 1972.00] P:1598.90 E:0.083439 |  but as a set play, don't stay up on the left wing, just make your way back into position maybe
[1972.00 - 1974.00] P:1371.01 E:0.061654 |  and get set properly.
[1974.00 - 1978.00] P:1810.08 E:0.081101 |  Cross in low from Juranovic, cut out by Miller.
[1978.00 - 1982.00] P:1858.14 E:0.081489 |  Lloria plays it forward and then Estaki knocks it back towards Miller
[1982.00 - 1987.00] P:1890.65 E:0.089082 |  who just puts his left foot on the ball, stands still and only when he is faced by Modrić
[1987.00 - 1994.00] P:1879.39 E:0.081177 |  and now they're being pressed by Croatia. Lloria up this near side, the left is being penned in
[1994.00 - 2000.00] P:1865.17 E:0.082266 |  and he's given away a throw which Kramaric wants to take quickly for Croatia, looking for an equaliser.
[2000.00 - 2007.00] P:1770.96 E:0.075020 |  Canada lead by a goal to nil here, just under 12 minutes to go to halve time.
[2007.00 - 2010.00] P:1870.27 E:0.085312 |  Alfonso Davis with the goal after 67 seconds.
[2010.00 - 2015.00] P:1684.68 E:0.079878 |  He missed that penalty after 11 minutes against Belgium.
[2015.00 - 2020.00] P:1790.93 E:0.081935 |  One of three of ten that have been missed so far in this World Cup
[2020.00 - 2023.00] P:1791.04 E:0.075366 |  but Canada have got some defending to do.
[2023.00 - 2026.00] P:1731.29 E:0.069160 |  Juranovic to take a throw.
[2026.00 - 2030.00] P:1791.79 E:0.081039 |  Long one and it comes now from the right hand side,
[2030.00 - 2035.00] P:1750.64 E:0.074486 |  rides up the chest of Kramaric, looks for a shooting angle with his back to goal,
[2035.00 - 2040.00] P:1838.02 E:0.087486 |  plays it out towards Sosa, the cross deep, flicked away only as far as Modrić,
[2040.00 - 2046.00] P:1765.53 E:0.074307 |  canons around in the penalty area and eventually Canada will play it out
[2046.00 - 2048.00] P:1911.07 E:0.092276 |  but have to concede another throw.
[2048.00 - 2052.00] P:1768.40 E:0.085680 |  That was not convincing defending in terms of just keeping your composure,
[2052.00 - 2055.00] P:1867.97 E:0.093373 |  making sure you get a good connection with the ball when you're trying to clear it.
[2055.00 - 2060.00] P:1690.32 E:0.083935 |  There's a lot of wild swipes at the ball, pinball in the 18-yard box
[2060.00 - 2065.00] P:1474.47 E:0.069098 |  and now defending what looks to be a long throw coming into the box.
[2065.00 - 2070.00] P:1822.37 E:0.087049 |  Another one from Juranovic, level the penalty area on this near side,
[2070.00 - 2072.00] P:1811.52 E:0.080191 |  the right playing from left to right.
[2072.00 - 2076.00] P:1855.08 E:0.087430 |  In it is, it's direct to the feet of Modrić, back to Modrić right hand side.
[2076.00 - 2078.00] P:1892.98 E:0.076006 |  Modrić with the right footed cross,
[2078.00 - 2081.00] P:1915.88 E:0.092556 |  tucked in there was Alistair Johnston to head the ball away.
[2081.00 - 2085.00] P:1769.13 E:0.072894 |  Modrić though has it once more, back inside to Brozowicz
[2085.00 - 2089.00] P:1851.74 E:0.073640 |  who curls the ball to the left corner of the area.
[2089.00 - 2094.00] P:1704.92 E:0.070395 |  Lvivajic plays it out to Sosa, back more now with Kovacic.
[2094.00 - 2098.00] P:1877.65 E:0.081904 |  Brozowicz, every outfield player in the Canada half.
[2098.00 - 2101.00] P:2007.00 E:0.081899 |  Modrić just starting to pull some strings coming onto this ball.
[2101.00 - 2106.00] P:1962.04 E:0.090930 |  The ball played forward now and then the shot away from Lvivajic
[2106.00 - 2111.00] P:1925.90 E:0.093072 |  and Boyan made the save, straight at him behind it goes for a corner.
[2111.00 - 2114.00] P:1812.75 E:0.084637 |  Yes, the running and the movement of Kovacic again
[2114.00 - 2118.00] P:1715.50 E:0.094520 |  is really starting to get things moving in that midfield area for Croatia.
[2118.00 - 2122.00] P:1554.68 E:0.075056 |  Lovely play, link-up play, picks up the second ball,
[2122.00 - 2126.00] P:1611.57 E:0.086555 |  then slips it into Lvivajic onto his right foot.
[2126.00 - 2128.00] P:1743.57 E:0.089693 |  I mean straight at the goalkeeper, but he had to stay big
[2128.00 - 2132.00] P:1559.46 E:0.083477 |  and just make a big block to put it out for a corner.
[2133.00 - 2138.00] P:1771.41 E:0.084553 |  Deflected off the knees of Boyan, corner kick to Croatia.
[2138.00 - 2142.00] P:1890.43 E:0.085036 |  Still trelling by Goulton-Hill, near side the right, right footed.
[2142.00 - 2145.00] P:1833.49 E:0.090351 |  Guardiola is up, Lovren is up there as well.
[2145.00 - 2148.00] P:1943.55 E:0.089222 |  Lovren didn't know where the ball was there as it last came off his head
[2148.00 - 2151.00] P:1835.76 E:0.087259 |  and went directly up in the air and he was looking to the left
[2151.00 - 2153.00] P:1791.63 E:0.079846 |  and looking to the right before it could drop.
[2153.00 - 2157.00] P:1825.64 E:0.071707 |  Sosa on that far side, the left for Croatia, plays it forward.
[2157.00 - 2160.00] P:1885.26 E:0.074522 |  Guardiola stayed back to Kovacic.
[2160.00 - 2164.00] P:1775.75 E:0.086956 |  Estekij is in front of him, passes it to the left corner of the area.
[2164.00 - 2168.00] P:1994.95 E:0.105121 |  They played it into Kramaric, flex stays down on this occasion.
[2168.00 - 2173.00] P:1903.64 E:0.102781 |  And Kramaric really equalised in nine minutes before half-time.
[2173.00 - 2175.00] P:1903.67 E:0.093929 |  We're back all square.
[2175.00 - 2178.00] P:1915.11 E:0.095523 |  Croatia won, Canada won.
[2178.00 - 2180.00] P:1901.88 E:0.102965 |  Well, you could just feel that one coming.
[2180.00 - 2184.00] P:1881.19 E:0.098472 |  The dominance of Croatia has just slowly been creeping into this game,
[2184.00 - 2189.00] P:1765.97 E:0.094217 |  bit by bit, they've been growing and growing, starting to get up to speed.
[2189.00 - 2192.00] P:1739.95 E:0.100667 |  And this was a lovely work move, really good passing.
[2192.00 - 2195.00] P:1685.09 E:0.090284 |  I have to say, Canada just switched off a little bit here,
[2195.00 - 2199.00] P:1666.83 E:0.096968 |  onto the left foot of Kramaric and that's a really good finish.
[2199.00 - 2203.00] P:1786.59 E:0.093521 |  He picks up the ball on the corner of the six-yard box almost.
[2203.00 - 2207.00] P:1754.85 E:0.086270 |  It's poor defending but a really good finish into the far post.
[2207.00 - 2210.00] P:1699.08 E:0.080734 |  Nobody had picked him up, had they?
[2210.00 - 2213.00] P:1870.19 E:0.099813 |  Not too sure whose responsibility it was,
[2213.00 - 2218.00] P:1791.07 E:0.090192 |  but he had so much space to turn inside left channel, the penalty area.
[2218.00 - 2221.00] P:1885.72 E:0.099933 |  Just an instinctive first time left footed shot past Boja,
[2221.00 - 2223.00] P:1655.27 E:0.090978 |  into the side of the net, 1-1.
[2223.00 - 2226.00] P:1609.97 E:0.073424 |  I think it was Hutchinson actually just switched off from midfield,
[2226.00 - 2228.00] P:1477.95 E:0.087869 |  he's just got away from him.
[2231.00 - 2235.00] P:1477.21 E:0.074619 |  And Canada have been pegged back
[2235.00 - 2240.00] P:1705.41 E:0.086391 |  after making that dream start with eight minutes to go at a half time.
[2240.00 - 2243.00] P:1660.11 E:0.077234 |  And the group changes once more.
[2244.00 - 2248.00] P:1697.10 E:0.084575 |  A point would mean that Canada have still got something to cling to
[2248.00 - 2250.00] P:1689.58 E:0.085182 |  going into the final group game.
[2250.00 - 2253.00] P:1808.23 E:0.097475 |  The only permutation where they would be eliminated
[2253.00 - 2258.00] P:1676.34 E:0.084483 |  is if they were to lose here tonight to the runners-up in the World Cup of 2018.
[2258.00 - 2263.00] P:1729.08 E:0.085132 |  But it's the Croatian support in their pockets away towards our left-hand side,
[2263.00 - 2271.00] P:1659.41 E:0.077058 |  who are celebrating now 1-1 here in the Khalifa International Stadium.
[2272.00 - 2275.00] P:1785.27 E:0.087929 |  And after having that goal disallowed on this occasion,
[2275.00 - 2280.00] P:1850.59 E:0.098673 |  there was no question whatsoever for the former Leicester City man.
[2284.00 - 2290.00] P:1823.43 E:0.091452 |  But his 21st goal for Croatia on his 76th appearance.
[2291.00 - 2297.00] P:1548.09 E:0.085418 |  I mean, it was just comfortable, wasn't it, in terms of how they moved the ball, Croatia?
[2298.00 - 2302.00] P:1544.71 E:0.084954 |  Not well enough set, Canada, not really kind of honed into the movement
[2302.00 - 2307.00] P:1749.81 E:0.083781 |  and areas of the pitch, and he just drifted off the back of Hutchinson into that space,
[2307.00 - 2309.00] P:1703.87 E:0.096791 |  and it was quite a simple pass through.
[2309.00 - 2312.00] P:1750.05 E:0.079968 |  Nicely worked, but comfortable goal.
[2312.00 - 2317.00] P:1844.92 E:0.097152 |  Croatia now are breaking forward, and it's Kramaric running down that left-hand side.
[2317.00 - 2322.00] P:1917.58 E:0.097826 |  He cuts inside to the edge of the area, and now Canada have got enough players back,
[2322.00 - 2325.00] P:1866.53 E:0.073105 |  and he waits for the supporting run of Perisic,
[2325.00 - 2329.00] P:1864.32 E:0.089988 |  and it goes away from Brosevic in that midfield, and is picked up by Borjant.
[2329.00 - 2335.00] P:1742.67 E:0.071238 |  But as Canada had committed men forward, Kramaric was looking to try and take full advantage.
[2335.00 - 2339.00] P:1554.19 E:0.091100 |  Yeah, I mean, they're looking quite vulnerable, aren't they, Canada, on the counter.
[2339.00 - 2343.00] P:1560.71 E:0.078515 |  If they're high up the pitch, it's probably the most dangerous position for them.
[2343.00 - 2350.00] P:1732.89 E:0.088324 |  Ball played forward to Karl Lahren, unable to really ever get the ball at his feet,
[2350.00 - 2356.00] P:1501.59 E:0.084075 |  and look convincing as a striker on that occasion.
[2356.00 - 2363.00] P:1651.50 E:0.076546 |  The move breaks down. They haven't, they've lacked that verve that they had when they played Belgium.
[2363.00 - 2369.00] P:1422.77 E:0.075961 |  I know, I mean, you don't know how an early goal can psychologically affect a team sometimes.
[2369.00 - 2372.00] P:1311.01 E:0.080738 |  I mean, it's obviously a positive thing you've scored, you know,
[2372.00 - 2375.00] P:1543.46 E:0.084917 |  and for them, especially in the World Cup, it's a big deal.
[2375.00 - 2381.00] P:1527.57 E:0.083400 |  But whether or not that just slightly changes your mindset, just dampens the fact you've got something to lose.
[2381.00 - 2384.00] P:1529.87 E:0.085969 |  You know, it can create that feeling sometimes, then, though.
[2384.00 - 2391.00] P:1408.88 E:0.075154 |  And you haven't seen the, maybe the same, quite the same kind of energy and freedom that you saw in that first game.
[2391.00 - 2393.00] P:1723.48 E:0.101670 |  Ester Kee has gone down at the moment.
[2393.00 - 2399.00] P:1720.64 E:0.093658 |  Creation voices you can hear in the distance inside the Khalifa International Stadium.
[2399.00 - 2405.00] P:1693.75 E:0.098847 |  Ester Kee, I'm not too sure what his problem was, but he's a very important player for them in the midfield.
[2405.00 - 2415.00] P:1635.64 E:0.086387 |  He likes to break up the play, plays for Porto, and contribute the odd goal too from midfield, Steffen Ester Kee.
[2415.00 - 2422.00] P:1764.71 E:0.089174 |  And just before he sat down, there was words being exchanged between Modrich and L'Orea as well.
[2422.00 - 2427.00] P:1708.47 E:0.075068 |  So a lot of the Croatians are taking on liquid refreshment at the moment.
[2427.00 - 2434.00] P:1485.35 E:0.064658 |  A reminder that we've got Spain, Germany to come from 7 o'clock.
[2434.00 - 2438.00] P:1641.23 E:0.085224 |  And then the reaction from today's games and the look ahead to tomorrow,
[2438.00 - 2442.00] P:1656.57 E:0.085634 |  your daily dose from Doha on the World Cup Daily podcast,
[2442.00 - 2444.00] P:1713.16 E:0.088113 |  available on the BBC Sounds.
[2444.00 - 2450.00] P:1752.02 E:0.083005 |  And also, whilst Ester Kee is down, she just points out another special program on BBC Sounds,
[2450.00 - 2454.00] P:1644.46 E:0.088628 |  particularly after yesterday's sad news regarding the death of Doddy Weir.
[2454.00 - 2461.00] P:1530.52 E:0.077217 |  There is a tribute to Doddy Weir all about the great man that you can listen to.
[2461.00 - 2464.00] P:1748.63 E:0.083584 |  Certainly when I used to speak to him in my days at BBC Newcastle,
[2464.00 - 2468.00] P:1793.06 E:0.088658 |  he was one of the few people, Matt, that I actually had to look up to to interview.
[2469.00 - 2474.00] P:1737.86 E:0.082237 |  There was certainly Doddy, wonderful man, and then they had a lad called Richard Metcalf,
[2474.00 - 2477.00] P:1716.21 E:0.080625 |  who was even taller than Doddy.
[2477.00 - 2480.00] P:1718.66 E:0.067147 |  And his nickname was Too Tall.
[2480.00 - 2483.00] P:1739.19 E:0.078314 |  And then when he played for Scotland, the Scottish International,
[2483.00 - 2485.00] P:1872.46 E:0.081318 |  they changed his nickname to Muk Too Tall.
[2485.00 - 2490.00] P:1795.12 E:0.079210 |  And I wouldn't be surprised if Doddy was at the heart of that for changing the nickname.
[2490.00 - 2494.00] P:1684.23 E:0.074761 |  But all about Doddy Weir remembering him and our condolences to his family and friends.
[2494.00 - 2496.00] P:1726.17 E:0.082638 |  That's on BBC Sounds.
[2496.00 - 2499.00] P:1776.48 E:0.091160 |  Three minutes to go to halftime, you're listening to Five Live.
[2499.00 - 2501.00] P:1503.87 E:0.096039 |  He sounds like an amazing personality.
[2501.00 - 2504.00] P:1696.74 E:0.072218 |  Well, yeah, he certainly was.
[2504.00 - 2506.00] P:1682.83 E:0.079526 |  And what he's done since.
[2506.00 - 2508.00] P:1635.20 E:0.060883 |  Yeah.
[2510.00 - 2513.00] P:1531.88 E:0.082583 |  I think that will be his legacy.
[2515.00 - 2519.00] P:1410.72 E:0.076921 |  What was your nickname when you were playing for England?
[2519.00 - 2521.00] P:1384.86 E:0.079773 |  It wasn't Too Tall.
[2521.00 - 2523.00] P:1233.94 E:0.063673 |  That with Lariat.
[2523.00 - 2526.00] P:1406.21 E:0.070983 |  You're not going to give us anything on that one there?
[2526.00 - 2529.00] P:1549.37 E:0.095967 |  No, I don't know if I've got anything to give to him.
[2529.00 - 2531.00] P:1329.40 E:0.076870 |  Boyan clears it away.
[2531.00 - 2535.00] P:1432.35 E:0.068531 |  Gavadiole rises in the air.
[2535.00 - 2542.00] P:1559.57 E:0.077905 |  Estiqui is picked up and is running OK after that treatment
[2542.00 - 2547.00] P:1772.93 E:0.089042 |  in the end of the first half here, two and a half minutes to go to halftime.
[2547.00 - 2550.00] P:1832.39 E:0.094282 |  Croatia won, Canada won.
[2550.00 - 2553.00] P:1729.39 E:0.066235 |  And Buchanan with a throw.
[2553.00 - 2556.00] P:1431.34 E:0.068100 |  They'll want to see this to halftime, Canada.
[2556.00 - 2559.00] P:1318.41 E:0.083503 |  It's not been a good last ten minutes, has it?
[2559.00 - 2561.00] P:1572.30 E:0.083943 |  They've been pulled apart a little bit.
[2561.00 - 2565.00] P:1636.21 E:0.088734 |  Croatia stepped it up, started to get their passing game going.
[2565.00 - 2567.00] P:1673.13 E:0.091155 |  Controlled the ball in good areas of the pitch.
[2567.00 - 2570.00] P:1597.72 E:0.078903 |  They mentioned that the running and the movement of Kovacic.
[2570.00 - 2574.00] P:1599.71 E:0.086719 |  They're looking like they could just pull apart that back four
[2574.00 - 2577.00] P:1391.82 E:0.068653 |  and move them around a little bit too easily.
[2577.00 - 2582.00] P:1510.95 E:0.074226 |  I'd be fascinated with the mindset of Canada,
[2582.00 - 2585.00] P:1699.60 E:0.085778 |  particularly in the second half, what John Herdman will do
[2585.00 - 2589.00] P:1758.07 E:0.086300 |  at the halftime team talk, bearing in mind that if they go all out
[2589.00 - 2593.00] P:1743.34 E:0.076897 |  for the three points and they get picked off, then they're eliminated.
[2593.00 - 2596.00] P:1711.88 E:0.087141 |  The one point might be something that they can then build on
[2596.00 - 2598.00] P:1829.25 E:0.083810 |  for their final match against Morocco.
[2598.00 - 2600.00] P:1642.37 E:0.085965 |  It keeps them in it, doesn't it?
[2600.00 - 2605.00] P:1659.60 E:0.075684 |  It does. So how much adventure they will play with in the second half?
[2605.00 - 2608.00] P:1676.20 E:0.069003 |  It's one apiece at the minute.
[2608.00 - 2610.00] P:1725.11 E:0.087323 |  Modric back to Gavadjol.
[2610.00 - 2616.00] P:1717.07 E:0.074455 |  Lovren to Yuranovic over the halfway line on this right-hand side.
[2616.00 - 2618.00] P:1973.00 E:0.100633 |  Gets the return ball.
[2618.00 - 2620.00] P:1867.48 E:0.095851 |  Yuranovic running away from Alfonso Davies.
[2620.00 - 2624.00] P:1903.56 E:0.087727 |  Just still going, helps it to Liliya with a shot.
[2624.00 - 2626.00] P:2010.16 E:0.107827 |  Great finish.
[2626.00 - 2628.00] P:1939.00 E:0.113595 |  Got it out for him and it's his feet so quickly.
[2628.00 - 2630.00] P:1853.02 E:0.112455 |  Right foot, it finds the bottom left-hand corner.
[2630.00 - 2633.00] P:1864.95 E:0.104511 |  And the man brought back into the Croatian side.
[2634.00 - 2637.00] P:1887.66 E:0.101459 |  Has turned it around just before halftime
[2637.00 - 2640.00] P:1902.52 E:0.093609 |  and Croatian lead Canada by two goals to one.
[2640.00 - 2645.00] P:1683.95 E:0.093773 |  Well, he's come into the team today to do his job, which is exactly this.
[2645.00 - 2649.00] P:1758.75 E:0.098749 |  Put the ball in the back of the net and he does it brilliantly with his finish.
[2649.00 - 2652.00] P:1634.42 E:0.079575 |  You know, credit to the build-up plate.
[2652.00 - 2654.00] P:1722.62 E:0.107443 |  It's superb on this Croatian right-hand side.
[2654.00 - 2657.00] P:1689.74 E:0.097778 |  The movement has all of a sudden kicked on another level.
[2657.00 - 2660.00] P:1745.43 E:0.092041 |  The directness, the energy.
[2660.00 - 2665.00] P:1726.85 E:0.096559 |  But Lovren with his right-footed strike, I mean, it's so clean.
[2665.00 - 2669.00] P:1648.80 E:0.091212 |  The ball pops to him, it's a tackle from Miller, who goes to ground.
[2669.00 - 2672.00] P:1699.07 E:0.095899 |  But he can't get enough on the ball to really clear it.
[2672.00 - 2677.00] P:1625.81 E:0.092920 |  It slips through to Lovren, takes one touch and it's a brilliant striker's finish.
[2677.00 - 2681.00] P:1540.96 E:0.090259 |  Right footed across the goalkeeper, into the bottom corner.
[2681.00 - 2683.00] P:1557.54 E:0.078009 |  Really good goal from Croatia.
[2683.00 - 2688.00] P:1713.87 E:0.091800 |  And if you're thinking what I'm thinking, then that conversation about the mindset
[2688.00 - 2692.00] P:1709.79 E:0.082858 |  now is all out attack as far as Canada are concerned in the second half
[2692.00 - 2695.00] P:1641.83 E:0.084416 |  because this is a score line that would eliminate them.
[2695.00 - 2698.00] P:1772.65 E:0.096294 |  So they're certainly going to have to get something from it.
[2698.00 - 2703.00] P:1815.08 E:0.084339 |  Croatia with two goals in eight minutes, and now leading by two goals to one.
[2703.00 - 2707.00] P:1679.13 E:0.090787 |  The quality of Croatia is just standing out at the moment, isn't it?
[2707.00 - 2709.00] P:1589.33 E:0.080200 |  The last 20 minutes.
[2709.00 - 2715.00] P:1753.39 E:0.093649 |  Perisic with the cross from the left-hand side, hooked away by Estaki.
[2715.00 - 2718.00] P:1855.48 E:0.092871 |  And they're actually looking for more goals now.
[2718.00 - 2722.00] P:1871.77 E:0.098976 |  We're into five minutes, I've added on time here in the end of the first half
[2722.00 - 2727.00] P:1680.19 E:0.078786 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live, but he just took it so well.
[2727.00 - 2730.00] P:1872.26 E:0.087675 |  Because he actually had to take a couple of touches to get it out
[2730.00 - 2732.00] P:1835.34 E:0.096940 |  before he could strike it right.
[2732.00 - 2734.00] P:1787.86 E:0.091666 |  It was kind of under his feet a little bit and he had to dig it out
[2734.00 - 2739.00] P:1593.40 E:0.074510 |  and then get it into position and the strike, well, super clean and accurate
[2739.00 - 2741.00] P:1524.36 E:0.086831 |  into the bottom corner.
[2741.00 - 2744.00] P:1559.68 E:0.078206 |  He brought him in because of his goal record of late.
[2744.00 - 2747.00] P:1512.86 E:0.091664 |  It's a lot, lot better than other strikers in the team.
[2747.00 - 2750.00] P:1570.71 E:0.064361 |  He's scoring a lot of goals domestically.
[2750.00 - 2754.00] P:1564.23 E:0.084119 |  Looks to be a good move from Zlatan Dalic.
[2754.00 - 2757.00] P:1810.83 E:0.101773 |  Hurchinson plays the ball out to David.
[2757.00 - 2759.00] P:1775.53 E:0.074259 |  He'll win a throw for Canada.
[2759.00 - 2761.00] P:1887.88 E:0.086987 |  They look a little bit shell-shot.
[2761.00 - 2762.00] P:1350.23 E:0.082526 |  Oh, totally.
[2762.00 - 2766.00] P:1630.91 E:0.076513 |  It's almost like they're just not coping with the quality in the movement
[2766.00 - 2768.00] P:1589.10 E:0.064653 |  at the moment. It's too good.
[2768.00 - 2771.00] P:1486.23 E:0.081185 |  They started the game well, but Croatia haven't panicked.
[2771.00 - 2774.00] P:1526.18 E:0.103275 |  They looked a little bit lackluster in the opening, probably 10, 15 minutes.
[2774.00 - 2777.00] P:1575.72 E:0.090357 |  I thought they were struggling a bit, but they certainly have come
[2777.00 - 2780.00] P:1531.93 E:0.072753 |  into this game strongly again.
[2780.00 - 2784.00] P:1692.04 E:0.085712 |  Croatia with Kramaric looking for Lvivaya.
[2784.00 - 2790.00] P:1803.36 E:0.086963 |  Timely header away by Vittoria, kept in play on that far side by Johnston.
[2790.00 - 2794.00] P:1882.70 E:0.096594 |  But actually, he's actually only presented the ball then for Perisic.
[2794.00 - 2795.00] P:1874.24 E:0.100784 |  She will pull the ball back.
[2795.00 - 2796.00] P:1763.54 E:0.080324 |  Here is Kramaric.
[2796.00 - 2799.00] P:1901.21 E:0.098642 |  Kramaric with a shot on the edge of the area left footed.
[2799.00 - 2800.00] P:1629.49 E:0.076984 |  Couldn't keep it down.
[2800.00 - 2802.00] P:1819.49 E:0.088898 |  Out of play, it goes for a goal kick.
[2802.00 - 2804.00] P:1912.08 E:0.094377 |  They still lead by two goals to one.
[2804.00 - 2805.00] P:1470.21 E:0.069948 |  Yeah, they've got the taste now.
[2805.00 - 2807.00] P:1702.16 E:0.099390 |  They really have great work from Perisic.
[2807.00 - 2809.00] P:1769.44 E:0.077294 |  Saw the touch onto the line.
[2809.00 - 2812.00] P:1592.81 E:0.080778 |  It was going to keep the ball in, Johnston, but read it so well,
[2812.00 - 2816.00] P:1510.28 E:0.078799 |  stole it from him, and then there's six players arriving from Croatia
[2816.00 - 2818.00] P:1631.42 E:0.086697 |  in the 18-yard box.
[2818.00 - 2820.00] P:1671.17 E:0.078778 |  That's the belief they have right at this moment in time
[2820.00 - 2824.00] P:1487.85 E:0.069760 |  that they can go and get another goal before half time.
[2824.00 - 2825.00] P:1631.96 E:0.067932 |  That's Matt Upsen.
[2825.00 - 2830.00] P:1713.97 E:0.079477 |  Peter Schmeichel will be in the five-live commentary box with John Murray,
[2830.00 - 2835.00] P:1697.16 E:0.076200 |  Kelly Cates presenting from the stadium for Spain, Germany at 7 o'clock.
[2835.00 - 2839.00] P:1649.94 E:0.091582 |  Germany certainly under real pressure going into that game.
[2839.00 - 2841.00] P:1659.40 E:0.086323 |  They have a dreadful record against Spain.
[2841.00 - 2843.00] P:1588.68 E:0.075443 |  So that's from 7.
[2843.00 - 2845.00] P:1726.38 E:0.085852 |  And like this one, you'll be able to listen to it
[2845.00 - 2849.00] P:1680.42 E:0.092426 |  and watch it through World Cup Extra on the BBC iPlayer.
[2849.00 - 2852.00] P:1823.06 E:0.086342 |  But we're in stoppage time here in the Kaleifa International Stadium,
[2852.00 - 2857.00] P:1641.77 E:0.084357 |  where Croatia, who were trailing by a goal to an ill, are leading by two goals to one.
[2857.00 - 2861.00] P:1656.10 E:0.086095 |  David, just outside the centre-circle, plays the ball out wide.
[2861.00 - 2863.00] P:1710.82 E:0.068237 |  Johnston does well to keep it in play.
[2863.00 - 2867.00] P:1664.63 E:0.085540 |  Ahead of him, a little touch now, is Buchanan, coming in off that right touch line.
[2867.00 - 2870.00] P:1599.10 E:0.074769 |  Hutchinson, now towards Miller.
[2870.00 - 2874.00] P:1753.62 E:0.085590 |  Estaki wanders across, backpedaling to this near side, the left,
[2874.00 - 2876.00] P:1708.17 E:0.085293 |  all in black, playing from right to left.
[2876.00 - 2879.00] P:1766.68 E:0.078418 |  Croatia have everybody back behind the ball.
[2879.00 - 2881.00] P:1648.97 E:0.064260 |  Hutchinson, the captain for Canada.
[2881.00 - 2884.00] P:1755.05 E:0.075889 |  Out towards Johnston, back to Hutchinson.
[2884.00 - 2886.00] P:1657.87 E:0.069300 |  Little touch from David, falls down.
[2886.00 - 2889.00] P:1815.52 E:0.097446 |  Jureguan referee not having any of that.
[2889.00 - 2894.00] P:1788.86 E:0.084739 |  Croatia now will break, and the ball goes through the middle, and it's to Kramaric.
[2894.00 - 2897.00] P:1775.93 E:0.080851 |  Lvivaya tries to hold his run.
[2897.00 - 2903.00] P:1761.73 E:0.069621 |  The support now comes from Brozovic, played behind him by Kovacic.
[2903.00 - 2908.00] P:1719.29 E:0.086979 |  And now Perisic's looking to try and get on the end of that, but scooped up by Boyan.
[2908.00 - 2911.00] P:1848.97 E:0.076634 |  Particularly down the left, they've caused Canada problems.
[2911.00 - 2913.00] P:1577.58 E:0.065389 |  They look relaxed, don't they?
[2913.00 - 2917.00] P:1572.46 E:0.073285 |  Croatia enjoying it, smooth counter-attacking well.
[2917.00 - 2920.00] P:1537.81 E:0.079588 |  When they win the ball back, they've got good runs forwards.
[2920.00 - 2925.00] P:1566.24 E:0.072574 |  They're timing it well, they look really comfortable at the moment, Croatia.
[2925.00 - 2928.00] P:1589.11 E:0.080535 |  Buchanan coming forward over the halfway line.
[2928.00 - 2932.00] P:1733.11 E:0.076132 |  Estaki out it goes, he's pulled out a little.
[2932.00 - 2937.00] P:1787.74 E:0.087712 |  Actually, David did ever so well to keep that ball in play on this near side, the left.
[2937.00 - 2940.00] P:1698.99 E:0.093190 |  Buchanan now in a central area, man over on the right, not required.
[2940.00 - 2944.00] P:1891.78 E:0.090927 |  He plays it short and forward towards David, but he's been shrugged off the ball.
[2944.00 - 2949.00] P:1897.30 E:0.090970 |  And all of a sudden the break is on with Kovacic, and Kovacic passes the ball out towards Perisic,
[2949.00 - 2952.00] P:1789.12 E:0.071204 |  and the cross comes in first time.
[2952.00 - 2957.00] P:1719.68 E:0.080433 |  That was Guardiola, who was leading the line.
[2957.00 - 2961.00] P:1609.54 E:0.087288 |  And I don't think he was seen, because the ball went out wide early to Perisic,
[2961.00 - 2964.00] P:1523.90 E:0.087664 |  where really the pass to Guardiola might have well been on.
[2964.00 - 2967.00] P:1560.75 E:0.088611 |  It had been 1v1 with Miller, or put it in behind Miller even,
[2967.00 - 2970.00] P:1353.13 E:0.087002 |  and he looked like he had him for pace at that moment in time.
[2970.00 - 2975.00] P:1576.88 E:0.084655 |  But another example of the ball breaking down is it's going into the striker for Canada,
[2975.00 - 2979.00] P:1393.62 E:0.091484 |  into David, to Jonathan David or Larin.
[2979.00 - 2981.00] P:1496.78 E:0.087388 |  They're just not getting hold of the ball, are they?
[2981.00 - 2985.00] P:1542.14 E:0.081768 |  It's getting stolen, and all of a sudden, Croatia are on the counter-attack,
[2985.00 - 2987.00] P:1511.72 E:0.078633 |  and it's just so open at the back for Canada.
[2987.00 - 2991.00] P:1708.98 E:0.078479 |  It was the central defender streaking into the penalty box.
[2991.00 - 2994.00] P:1614.47 E:0.073101 |  Corners been taken short on the left-hand side.
[2994.00 - 2997.00] P:1798.71 E:0.078748 |  I won't ask if you ever did that.
[2997.00 - 2999.00] P:1622.08 E:0.071685 |  I knew that was coming.
[2999.00 - 3002.00] P:1600.92 E:0.100100 |  I'm not predictable, am I? I was going to the back waving people up.
[3002.00 - 3005.00] P:1727.85 E:0.056653 |  Go on, up you go.
[3005.00 - 3010.00] P:1645.26 E:0.067857 |  So, back into the centre circle, you'd be having a word with the editors.
[3010.00 - 3012.00] P:1815.59 E:0.091112 |  Can I make sure I'm not working with him tomorrow night?
[3012.00 - 3016.00] P:1750.32 E:0.093964 |  Can we put Denham on the front paper with a maple leaf on it?
[3016.00 - 3018.00] P:1834.02 E:0.103700 |  Thankfully, the halftime whistle has sounded.
[3018.00 - 3021.00] P:1812.90 E:0.097588 |  Croatia lead Canada by two goals to one,
[3021.00 - 3027.00] P:1786.43 E:0.090164 |  and it started so well for the Canadians with their first ever goal at Amens World Cup.
[3027.00 - 3032.00] P:1633.88 E:0.091337 |  The header from Alfonso Davies, the quickest of the tournament so far, 67 seconds.
[3032.00 - 3035.00] P:1711.65 E:0.096058 |  But Croatia had a goal that's allowed, Kramaric,
[3035.00 - 3042.00] P:1498.02 E:0.080566 |  but then he did score after 36 minutes, and then Levae just before halftime, 2-1, Matt.
[3042.00 - 3044.00] P:1441.20 E:0.082180 |  Interesting game, isn't it?
[3044.00 - 3049.00] P:1400.16 E:0.082576 |  It started as I really thought it would do in terms of Canada out the blocks
[3049.00 - 3051.00] P:1431.90 E:0.091487 |  with the energy, with the purpose.
[3051.00 - 3056.00] P:1296.74 E:0.083468 |  Croatia, not quite as good as what you'd expect, a little bit laboured,
[3056.00 - 3061.00] P:1410.96 E:0.085792 |  and that's how they started, but whether or not the goal switched the mindset a little bit,
[3061.00 - 3063.00] P:1465.54 E:0.085287 |  or they felt a little bit fearful, Canada,
[3063.00 - 3067.00] P:1651.71 E:0.101441 |  they just haven't been able to carry that on and take anything to Croatia,
[3067.00 - 3071.00] P:1560.70 E:0.086328 |  who, by the way, hats off to them after looking really a little bit sloppy
[3071.00 - 3074.00] P:1468.01 E:0.078536 |  in the opening 10 minutes, have come right back into this first half
[3074.00 - 3079.00] P:1398.28 E:0.088932 |  and looked very controlled, very comfortable, and show moments of real quality.
[3079.00 - 3083.00] P:1719.44 E:0.102921 |  And Jules, feel free to talk to Matt, but only about the football, not about the Maple Leaf.
[3083.00 - 3086.00] P:1878.97 E:0.116965 |  Really? How did you know I was going to mention that, Matt,
[3086.00 - 3090.00] P:1454.86 E:0.099248 |  because I'm not sure anyone would want to see dinner on the front page of a newspaper.
[3090.00 - 3092.00] P:1824.87 E:0.116170 |  I'm just trying to get it out of my head, to be honest.
[3092.00 - 3096.00] P:1656.07 E:0.093323 |  A Maple Leaf. Well, it's a sight that you've just put into mind, thankfully.
[3096.00 - 3100.00] P:1656.78 E:0.097573 |  Crowe, I say thankfully, I say thanks very much, as in sarcasm.
[3100.00 - 3104.00] P:1760.01 E:0.106835 |  Croatia, though, Matt, you really confused me now with that thought.
[3104.00 - 3110.00] P:1760.38 E:0.099819 |  Croatia, though, turning this one around, they're now in control with those two brilliant finishes.
[3110.00 - 3114.00] P:1544.78 E:0.112318 |  It just seems to be they've been refuelled by that eight-minute spell when they scored those goals.
[3114.00 - 3119.00] P:1462.63 E:0.087276 |  Yeah, I mean, it's been really well measured, it has to be said,
[3119.00 - 3122.00] P:1360.69 E:0.083986 |  and they've looked like they could have got more, to be honest,
[3122.00 - 3126.00] P:1357.44 E:0.084443 |  and the way they're breaking, when the ball's breaking down in their own half,
[3126.00 - 3130.00] P:1471.53 E:0.085189 |  the speed at which they've got runners going forward, I think is brilliant.
[3130.00 - 3133.00] P:1722.32 E:0.088547 |  I mean, Kovacic is showing his energy, showing his pace,
[3133.00 - 3138.00] P:1621.35 E:0.091630 |  but also in wide areas, Perisic, Kramaric, they're looking really good on the attack,
[3138.00 - 3142.00] P:1631.56 E:0.088642 |  and at the moment, you just feel like if they get the right combinations
[3142.00 - 3146.00] P:1403.31 E:0.085773 |  and the right numbers in the right area, they're just going to pick Canada off.
[3146.00 - 3151.00] P:1659.09 E:0.106986 |  Right, so at halftime in that match, where Croatia lead Canada by two goals,
[3151.00 - 3156.00] P:1563.78 E:0.098470 |  just to recap, group F turned upside down,
[3156.00 - 3160.00] P:1667.69 E:0.100820 |  Morocco winnors so far beating Belgium, Croatia leading, as I say,
[3160.00 - 3163.00] P:1568.10 E:0.092458 |  at halftime against Canada by two goals to one.
[3163.00 - 3167.00] P:1711.68 E:0.101382 |  Now, just to say if Canada can get themselves back into this one,
[3167.00 - 3173.00] P:1757.88 E:0.096458 |  and it does finish a draw, it would be impossible for both Belgium and Croatia to finish in the top two,
[3173.00 - 3178.00] P:1679.36 E:0.096870 |  so one would definitely go out and they play each other in the final group game.
[3178.00 - 3183.00] P:1653.22 E:0.098338 |  But coming up, we'll head over to the Albat Stadium to check in with John Murray and Peter Schmeichel,
[3183.00 - 3186.00] P:1742.33 E:0.095060 |  our team in place for Spain against Germany.
[3186.00 - 3190.00] P:1582.43 E:0.095534 |  It's our final commentary of the day here at the World Cup on day eight.
[3190.00 - 3196.00] P:1722.29 E:0.099279 |  Germany will be going into that match in a much better mood after that Costa Rica success today,
[3196.00 - 3202.00] P:1619.04 E:0.095362 |  but at seven minutes to five here on Five Live, it's time for the news with Alison Hughes.
[3202.00 - 3204.00] P:1512.25 E:0.154874 |  Take the World Cup with you.

[3226.00 - 3229.00] P:1778.57 E:0.067510 |  Tackling violence is a priority for the Met.
[3229.00 - 3237.00] P:1892.20 E:0.075470 |  Days like today show that why our work is so important and why I must ask all again for London communities to work with us
[3237.00 - 3242.00] P:1862.35 E:0.071062 |  and our partners so that we are doing all we can together to prevent such tragedies.

[3258.00 - 3263.00] P:1410.21 E:0.095861 |  Greater Manchester Police say a man found dead in Wigan with potentially hazardous substances on his body
[3263.00 - 3265.00] P:1588.75 E:0.087507 |  had been shot and doused in acid.

[3269.00 - 3277.00] P:1604.89 E:0.081545 |  Energy supplies have been asked by the Business Secretary Grant Sharps to make sure direct debit payments reflect customers' actual use
[3277.00 - 3282.00] P:1391.07 E:0.081456 |  rather than high estimates when people are cutting back on gas and electricity.
[3282.00 - 3286.00] P:1519.54 E:0.091662 |  Some households say their bills have soared despite using less energy.
[3286.00 - 3288.00] P:1526.22 E:0.093759 |  He is our business correspondent, Nour Nanji.
[3288.00 - 3292.00] P:1785.73 E:0.068442 |  Firstly, energy bills have been going up so even if you've been reducing your use,
[3292.00 - 3296.00] P:1710.68 E:0.082539 |  average bills are a lot higher this year than they were last year.
[3296.00 - 3299.00] P:1716.80 E:0.092204 |  And secondly as well, worth noting there's been a milder weather so far
[3299.00 - 3303.00] P:1727.48 E:0.079271 |  so some firms may have calculated that into their assumptions.
[3303.00 - 3307.00] P:1725.84 E:0.085780 |  Now it is worth also mentioning that people do have the right to challenge their direct debit
[3307.00 - 3311.00] P:1673.53 E:0.067897 |  so if you think you're paying more than you should, you should reach out to your supplier.
[3311.00 - 3316.00] P:1576.63 E:0.087664 |  Protests against China's strict anti-COVID policies have continued for a second day

[3412.00 - 3421.00] P:1614.55 E:0.079546 |  We know today if you don't give 100% it's impossible to win but with these fans, with this player, with this spirit
[3421.00 - 3424.00] P:1469.43 E:0.081957 |  we can do a best performance is what he do my player.
[3424.00 - 3427.00] P:1613.92 E:0.094823 |  I'm very happy but you know the competition is not finished.
[3427.00 - 3429.00] P:2049.23 E:0.061146 |  He's only four points.
[3429.00 - 3439.00] P:1761.02 E:0.065974 |  You need to recover quickly to can play against Canada with all the team and you bring good results for the qualification inshallah.
[3439.00 - 3445.00] P:1888.04 E:0.087754 |  May I just ask you about the return of Hakim Sieh and just his influence on the team on and off the pitch.
[3445.00 - 3448.00] P:1598.64 E:0.065896 |  You know this guy is incredible.
[3448.00 - 3452.00] P:1691.54 E:0.070256 |  The spirit when he come in this national team is come back.
[3452.00 - 3459.00] P:1566.00 E:0.074519 |  A lot of people talk about him, about his crazy guys, his difficult guys to manage.
[3459.00 - 3461.00] P:1734.26 E:0.069175 |  He can't help the team.
[3461.00 - 3470.00] P:1609.16 E:0.067171 |  Me what I see when you give him a love, a confidence, he can die for you and is what I give him.
[3470.00 - 3476.00] P:1599.37 E:0.084584 |  He returned to me my confidence and the confidence of the fans of Morocco because a lot of fans of Morocco
[3476.00 - 3484.00] P:1793.47 E:0.077072 |  he won't Hakim is come back in the team and he know that but he's a key player also same of Sofian.
[3484.00 - 3490.00] P:1571.06 E:0.081449 |  When you have this player in the field same of Ashraf of Mazraoui is different team.
[3490.00 - 3496.00] P:1783.55 E:0.072829 |  He's a big player, he play in a big team in Europe and you see his different player with national team.
[3496.00 - 3503.00] P:1878.90 E:0.065095 |  And Hakim Sieh retired from Morocco GTO after he is left out from the off-con team today though.
[3503.00 - 3506.00] P:1929.90 E:0.077702 |  He put in that man of the match performance.
[3506.00 - 3511.00] P:1583.56 E:0.085336 |  It's the first loss in the group stages though at the World Cup so far for Belgium since 1994.
[3511.00 - 3519.00] P:1821.73 E:0.085833 |  The spotlight well and truly on Roberto Martinez and he was asked why Kevin De Bruyne had been so ineffective so far.
[3519.00 - 3521.00] P:1381.74 E:0.073320 |  Well we haven't been best Belgium yet.
[3521.00 - 3525.00] P:1553.04 E:0.085125 |  I think it's fair to say that we are not at our best.
[3525.00 - 3532.00] P:1652.44 E:0.082194 |  I thought today we played until the goal. We played a step forward from where we were against Canada.
[3532.00 - 3540.00] P:1754.13 E:0.090732 |  We never lost the competitive age. We never lost the desire to get results, to use our experience to work hard.
[3540.00 - 3544.00] P:1746.23 E:0.081048 |  But on the ball we haven't been ourselves. I don't think it's just Kevin.
[3544.00 - 3548.00] P:1745.14 E:0.080197 |  The whole team we played with too much responsibility.
[3548.00 - 3552.00] P:1771.00 E:0.086980 |  We need to try to find that freedom, the expression.
[3552.00 - 3559.00] P:1470.59 E:0.087892 |  And when you do that as a team, football is a team sport, then every individual can reach a higher level.
[3559.00 - 3566.00] P:1629.05 E:0.083451 |  At the moment our work is to reach that level on what we do on the ball and being able to be ourselves at our very best.
[3566.00 - 3569.00] P:1695.03 E:0.077727 |  I think as a team we haven't reached that. It's not just individuals.
[3569.00 - 3573.00] P:1754.27 E:0.079834 |  Also where today has been a big day for Canadian sport,
[3573.00 - 3581.00] P:1644.72 E:0.089036 |  albeit the men's football team are two-one down as we've been hearing first half against Croatia with Ian Dennis and Matt Upson at the World Cup.
[3581.00 - 3587.00] P:1857.49 E:0.087056 |  In the last hour the tennis players have won the Davis Cup beating Australia in the final.
[3587.00 - 3591.00] P:1847.53 E:0.092058 |  Bournemouth have confirmed Gary O'Neill as their new permanent manager.
[3591.00 - 3596.00] P:1737.02 E:0.081392 |  He's been in charge of course on an interim basis since Scott Parker left Bournemouth in August.
[3596.00 - 3602.00] P:1890.69 E:0.090410 |  And the Times are reporting that into Miami are close to agreeing a deal to sign Leonel Messi.
[3602.00 - 3606.00] P:1837.87 E:0.096594 |  They say the move from PSG is set to happen at the end of the European season.
[3606.00 - 3611.00] P:1806.51 E:0.074398 |  It would make him the highest paid player in the history of the MLS.
[3611.00 - 3617.00] P:1843.89 E:0.095427 |  There's a huge final game coming up later today though on day eight of the World Cup.
[3617.00 - 3622.00] P:1733.16 E:0.087830 |  Germany looking to recover from their opening defeat against Japan when they take on Spain,
[3622.00 - 3625.00] P:1857.54 E:0.078227 |  who of course put seven past Costa Rica.
[3625.00 - 3632.00] P:1775.88 E:0.084112 |  But the group have seen today which changed massively Costa Rica bouncing back from that defeat to beat Japan 1-0.
[3632.00 - 3637.00] P:1871.33 E:0.095541 |  Let's check in with the EuroLeague's duo and the Rumi's Raffa Hogenstein and Guillen Balagay.
[3637.00 - 3640.00] P:1911.38 E:0.083411 |  They've been looking ahead to tonight's match.
[3640.00 - 3644.00] P:1802.89 E:0.065096 |  Let's imagine the worst case scenario in Germany lose against Spain.
[3644.00 - 3646.00] P:1512.22 E:0.039868 |  You going home, Raffi?
[3646.00 - 3651.00] P:1485.42 E:0.068306 |  I don't know, I'll have to ask the BBC if they need me anymore.
[3651.00 - 3656.00] P:1829.91 E:0.076447 |  Maybe I can change tack and become the Swiss expert.
[3656.00 - 3658.00] P:1509.73 E:0.089020 |  Lots of German speakers there.
[3658.00 - 3661.00] P:1619.95 E:0.065931 |  The Netherlands is close to Germany, similar language.
[3661.00 - 3664.00] P:1621.77 E:0.078983 |  So hopefully I'll be allowed to stay.
[3664.00 - 3669.00] P:1787.92 E:0.074685 |  You fell in the group stages in 2018 and in the last 16 against England in the recent Euros.
[3669.00 - 3672.00] P:1758.62 E:0.060679 |  Another fall from Grace is unthinkable, is it?
[3672.00 - 3675.00] P:1849.84 E:0.071071 |  It was before the game against Japan.
[3675.00 - 3683.00] P:1742.19 E:0.062785 |  Now I think it's probably realistic to assume that they might get knocked out because in the heads of the Germans,
[3683.00 - 3690.00] P:1375.71 E:0.067846 |  I think the Spain game was always going to be a possibility of a bad result, a draw or a defeat.
[3690.00 - 3695.00] P:1595.27 E:0.058229 |  The idea was that it doesn't matter that much because you win the other two games.
[3695.00 - 3699.00] P:1581.59 E:0.088146 |  Having lost against Japan, that thinking goes out the window.
[3699.00 - 3705.00] P:1759.80 E:0.059902 |  Now they've got back to the wall, they need to win both games, realistically, to go through.
[3705.00 - 3713.00] P:1682.66 E:0.069916 |  He don't really want to go into a second group stage game against Spain having to win.
[3713.00 - 3716.00] P:1535.79 E:0.057877 |  It's just a really bad starting point.
[3716.00 - 3723.00] P:1722.25 E:0.055412 |  For a team that created a lot of chances, played good football for 65 minutes,
[3723.00 - 3731.00] P:1482.25 E:0.056699 |  but also showed some of the weaknesses and it'd be very hard to have full confidence going into this game.
[3731.00 - 3733.00] P:1433.70 E:0.075111 |  Let me tell you the things that we don't do very well.
[3733.00 - 3737.00] P:1307.73 E:0.083874 |  We cannot cross the ball to the box, no one is going to head it.
[3737.00 - 3740.00] P:1674.65 E:0.076195 |  We don't shoot from outside the box, nobody thinks of that.
[3740.00 - 3743.00] P:1446.81 E:0.091308 |  We don't defend half of the pitch, the last defender is in the halfway line.
[3743.00 - 3746.00] P:1652.71 E:0.079410 |  We're not physical, we're too young, we don't have a number nine.
[3746.00 - 3749.00] P:1813.92 E:0.064286 |  It used to be a criticism, the youth, the lack of experience,
[3749.00 - 3755.00] P:1595.31 E:0.070131 |  and yet you saw a team that read very well what was happening against Costa Rica and were very angry.
[3755.00 - 3759.00] P:1719.80 E:0.062205 |  So the players that were coming on just kept the level up.
[3759.00 - 3766.00] P:1569.19 E:0.058257 |  How do you stop somebody like that considering that even though you won the ball and you want to dominate,
[3766.00 - 3771.00] P:1495.90 E:0.070661 |  your own players are saying some of the players that we've got don't want the ball.
[3771.00 - 3772.00] P:1240.73 E:0.021006 |  That's what was said, no?
[3772.00 - 3777.00] P:1331.79 E:0.074636 |  Well, it didn't want the ball at some stage, that was a criticism, that there was not enough movement,
[3777.00 - 3779.00] P:1755.96 E:0.095204 |  not enough responsibility taken.
[3779.00 - 3784.00] P:1889.03 E:0.073872 |  I don't think it's actually inherently a problem that these players don't want the ball
[3784.00 - 3787.00] P:1533.23 E:0.080058 |  because you have a lot of technical players who actually love the ball.
[3787.00 - 3793.00] P:1807.79 E:0.083378 |  It's just more in the reference to what the moment or the situation brought.
[3793.00 - 3796.00] P:1662.25 E:0.079849 |  There are some issues I think with the passing from the back,
[3796.00 - 3799.00] P:1610.25 E:0.086690 |  which for a possession team then becomes difficult.
[3799.00 - 3801.00] P:1787.41 E:0.091950 |  Germany really struggled once Japan pushed them high.
[3801.00 - 3805.00] P:1705.33 E:0.088835 |  When Japan said back, Germany controlled the game beautifully,
[3805.00 - 3807.00] P:1822.62 E:0.072124 |  it was quite slow but created chances.
[3807.00 - 3812.00] P:1602.10 E:0.089518 |  When Japan pushed up, Germany created chances but had a lot more problems building up properly.
[3812.00 - 3816.00] P:1815.80 E:0.081145 |  And I think if Spain see that, they will press them really high and think,
[3816.00 - 3822.00] P:1787.28 E:0.073823 |  you know what, these guys are not that comfortable passing through the back in an orderly fashion.
[3822.00 - 3828.00] P:1479.53 E:0.082998 |  And they have to go long and we don't have those players either that win those long or second balls.
[3828.00 - 3834.00] P:1799.27 E:0.078667 |  So that would be Spain's game plan, I'm sure, to disrupt the German supply lines.
[3834.00 - 3838.00] P:1643.30 E:0.073485 |  But Hansi Flick was asked, you know, is this the time to change the system?
[3838.00 - 3840.00] P:1518.30 E:0.097574 |  Is this the time to play three at the back?
[3840.00 - 3843.00] P:1720.00 E:0.064781 |  Is this the time to be more defensive?
[3843.00 - 3847.00] P:1680.74 E:0.078140 |  And he was basically saying, yes, things are bad, but they're not as bad
[3847.00 - 3854.00] P:1460.74 E:0.084938 |  that we now have to completely jeopardize our idea and go to just playing on the break and just sitting back.
[3854.00 - 3856.00] P:1255.26 E:0.093742 |  I don't think this team can do it.
[3856.00 - 3861.00] P:1655.99 E:0.073474 |  Rafa Hockenstein and Guillain Ballagay there talking ahead of our final match of the day.
[3861.00 - 3867.00] P:1872.88 E:0.083357 |  Germany against Spain and Germany, obviously, as I say, looking to recover from that opening defeat against Japan.
[3867.00 - 3873.00] P:1828.81 E:0.088107 |  Over on Five Sports Extra right now, we've got FA Cup second round commentary for you
[3873.00 - 3876.00] P:1804.62 E:0.097631 |  if you want to take in the action between Newport County and Derby County.
[3876.00 - 3877.00] P:1832.70 E:0.091054 |  It's one all there.
[3877.00 - 3882.00] P:1990.00 E:0.090454 |  Following the conclusion of that match, you can hear Ipswich Town against Buxton.
[3882.00 - 3884.00] P:1665.38 E:0.112322 |  We're underway at Portman Road, Aaron Paul.
[3884.00 - 3890.00] P:1796.72 E:0.099164 |  Yeah, Ipswich, Neil Buxton, the lowest ranked team in the competition, aimed to reach the third round for the first time since 1950.
[3890.00 - 3893.00] P:1845.19 E:0.097007 |  But Kieran McKenna has lined up with plenty of experience in the side.
[3893.00 - 3897.00] P:1815.29 E:0.091515 |  Seven of the 11 that played last week in League One start and we've begun here.
[3897.00 - 3900.00] P:1910.22 E:0.096493 |  Three minutes on the clock. Ipswich, Neil Buxton, Neil.
[3900.00 - 3905.00] P:1862.14 E:0.096478 |  They're about to get underway in the second half of Croatia against Canada.
[3905.00 - 3908.00] P:1749.98 E:0.103893 |  Croatia leading by two goals to one.
[3908.00 - 3911.00] P:1736.71 E:0.101358 |  A couple of substitutions very quickly, just giving you the FA Cup scores elsewhere.
[3911.00 - 3913.00] P:1423.50 E:0.098776 |  Ebsfleet, Neil, Fleetwood won.
[3913.00 - 3915.00] P:1677.69 E:0.105927 |  Bristol Rovers, Neil, Borumwood two.
[3915.00 - 3918.00] P:1773.22 E:0.089907 |  Burton, six, Cipanum Town one.
[3918.00 - 3921.00] P:1656.43 E:0.092171 |  And it's all on BBC One tonight at 10.45.
[3921.00 - 3925.00] P:1752.81 E:0.094684 |  Match of the day, FA Cup second round highlights for you.
[3925.00 - 3928.00] P:1745.81 E:0.118336 |  Back underway then, very shortly where you are, Matt Upson,
[3928.00 - 3931.00] P:1729.99 E:0.113742 |  alongside our own little maple leaf, Ian Dennis.
[3931.00 - 3932.00] P:1711.51 E:0.055147 |  Thank you, Chills.
[3932.00 - 3935.00] P:1776.11 E:0.093388 |  Two changes that have been made by John Herdman.
[3935.00 - 3938.00] P:1690.56 E:0.091195 |  Jonathan Osorio has come on for Kyle Lahren.
[3938.00 - 3942.00] P:1748.47 E:0.076364 |  And Ismail Kone has replaced Estaki.
[3942.00 - 3946.00] P:1852.97 E:0.090936 |  Now we saw that Estaki had gone down at times in that first half.
[3946.00 - 3952.00] P:1799.79 E:0.071372 |  So it means, of course, that John Herdman will still have an opportunity to make,
[3952.00 - 3955.00] P:1839.82 E:0.093048 |  well, three intervals to bring on essentially three more players.
[3955.00 - 3958.00] P:1684.43 E:0.088607 |  But that's a double change at the start of the second half.
[3958.00 - 3962.00] P:1633.64 E:0.083342 |  And there are two midfielders who've come on from midfield and are forward.
[3962.00 - 3966.00] P:1714.28 E:0.092183 |  So I'm thinking that there's probably going to be a change of formation here
[3966.00 - 3969.00] P:1654.70 E:0.083997 |  as they just settle down in the restart.
[3969.00 - 3973.00] P:1769.52 E:0.088598 |  So Canada trailing by two goals to one on five live and BBC sounds.
[3973.00 - 3975.00] P:1887.28 E:0.086854 |  Croatia coming from behind.
[3975.00 - 3979.00] P:1314.14 E:0.078289 |  And Boyan is in goal.
[3979.00 - 3984.00] P:1583.59 E:0.080642 |  Johnston, Vittoria and Miller, I think now they're going to go with the three central defenders.
[3984.00 - 3987.00] P:1584.91 E:0.080980 |  Are they at the back? Or is it still a flat back four?
[3987.00 - 3993.00] P:1535.03 E:0.087621 |  It looks a four because to me, Larea is still playing at left back.
[3993.00 - 3996.00] P:1545.54 E:0.079549 |  So Larea then is at the left back. That's the defence.
[3996.00 - 4003.00] P:1524.64 E:0.077572 |  Then the midfield, you've got Hutchinson, Kone, Davies, Buchanan, Osorio and Jonathan David.
[4003.00 - 4007.00] P:1674.40 E:0.088300 |  For Croatia, Livokovic is in goal.
[4007.00 - 4011.00] P:1725.77 E:0.093256 |  It's a back four of Juranovic, Gvardijol, Lovren and Sosa.
[4011.00 - 4014.00] P:1927.24 E:0.097423 |  Brozovic, Kovacic, Modric in the midfield.
[4014.00 - 4017.00] P:1416.66 E:0.082665 |  Krameric on the right.
[4017.00 - 4021.00] P:1227.27 E:0.096007 |  Livir through the middle.
[4021.00 - 4024.00] P:1815.72 E:0.088928 |  He got the second goal that gives Croatia the lead.
[4024.00 - 4029.00] P:1698.91 E:0.069978 |  And so Canada have got to produce something in this second half.
[4029.00 - 4032.00] P:1819.94 E:0.083891 |  Otherwise, they will be eliminated.
[4032.00 - 4035.00] P:1567.00 E:0.083389 |  To be fair, I think it does actually look like a back five
[4035.00 - 4039.00] P:1566.35 E:0.089896 |  because Buchanan looks to have dropped back into the right wing back position
[4040.00 - 4046.00] P:1481.05 E:0.087992 |  with Larea in the left wing back position, which I think just frees Alfonso Davies
[4046.00 - 4052.00] P:1289.98 E:0.080353 |  up to play high up the pitch and centre forward with Jonathan David.
[4052.00 - 4056.00] P:1524.31 E:0.087954 |  I think that's more the thinking. They were getting unstuck too easily.
[4056.00 - 4060.00] P:1636.08 E:0.082476 |  They can't afford to go a goal down in the opening five, ten minutes in the second half.
[4060.00 - 4063.00] P:1652.51 E:0.091088 |  So I think they've gone to that back five just to secure it up a little bit
[4063.00 - 4068.00] P:1503.30 E:0.079414 |  and then rely on a breakaway or a bit of a tack in flair from one of his front three.
[4069.00 - 4073.00] P:1871.96 E:0.092370 |  So then we're looking at a midfield three of Kone, Herchinsen and Jonathan Osorio
[4073.00 - 4079.00] P:1693.50 E:0.083984 |  with Alfonso Davies now in a more advanced position alongside Jonathan David up front.
[4079.00 - 4087.00] P:1621.32 E:0.080866 |  So Matt Upsen with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live, two and a half minutes into the second half.
[4087.00 - 4093.00] P:1559.43 E:0.083093 |  And they've got it all to do. Have Canada, who in four years time
[4093.00 - 4097.00] P:1721.91 E:0.073450 |  will of course be one of the three co-hosts.
[4097.00 - 4102.00] P:1651.78 E:0.089051 |  At least they've finally ended their barren spell of scoring.
[4102.00 - 4108.00] P:1648.26 E:0.077120 |  Now just got to try and secure their first point at a men's world cup.
[4108.00 - 4113.00] P:1575.07 E:0.071465 |  Here in the midfield is Ishmael Kone.
[4113.00 - 4119.00] P:1740.29 E:0.080627 |  The substitute just outside the centre circle, all in black playing from left to right as we look.
[4119.00 - 4123.00] P:1284.47 E:0.076072 |  And it's with Herchinsen.
[4123.00 - 4127.00] P:1619.33 E:0.094636 |  Special landmark for him tonight with his 100th appearance.
[4127.00 - 4131.00] P:1590.62 E:0.087217 |  Buchanan's cross from the right, strikes the legs of Guardiola.
[4131.00 - 4134.00] P:1751.01 E:0.098445 |  That caught Herchinsen full on the face but actually falls towards Buchanan
[4134.00 - 4138.00] P:1824.09 E:0.100885 |  who chips the ball towards the far side and Leria was there in an advanced position
[4138.00 - 4141.00] P:1720.22 E:0.092065 |  with a cushion header cleared away by the Croatian defence.
[4141.00 - 4146.00] P:1803.49 E:0.091184 |  Pickback up, Osorio, edge of the deep, looks for a shooting opportunity
[4146.00 - 4151.00] P:1692.03 E:0.095002 |  just this wide, hit it right footed, it was around head height
[4151.00 - 4157.00] P:1762.50 E:0.091421 |  and it was adenising as it just seemed to pull wide of that left hand post
[4157.00 - 4161.00] P:1863.13 E:0.096741 |  just in the last moment, it looked goalbound for so, so long.
[4161.00 - 4164.00] P:1442.31 E:0.084817 |  Yeah, I really thought I was going to see the net ripple there.
[4164.00 - 4169.00] P:1667.24 E:0.089872 |  Really nice effort from Osorio, just come on at half time, drops his shoulder,
[4169.00 - 4172.00] P:1579.62 E:0.086867 |  takes on one defender, pops it onto his right foot
[4172.00 - 4177.00] P:1602.24 E:0.085012 |  and then just hits a really nice strike across the goal, little bit of dip on it
[4177.00 - 4180.00] P:1663.56 E:0.085919 |  but always just fading away from that post.
[4180.00 - 4182.00] P:1450.39 E:0.085753 |  When it set off, it looked like it was on target, didn't it?
[4182.00 - 4184.00] P:1748.60 E:0.090259 |  It looked like it was going to hit the post and go in
[4184.00 - 4190.00] P:1598.26 E:0.080199 |  or just nestle inside the post but with the swing of the ball it just pulled wide of it.
[4190.00 - 4196.00] P:1661.26 E:0.086993 |  My first World Cup for BBC Radio 5 Live, was it Germany 2006?
[4196.00 - 4199.00] P:1615.63 E:0.094132 |  One of my first games would have been with the great Jimmy Arnfield
[4199.00 - 4203.00] P:1458.59 E:0.084051 |  and he'd have said we were right behind that and we were right behind it.
[4203.00 - 4206.00] P:1571.80 E:0.084748 |  We just saw it drop, drop wide.
[4207.00 - 4215.00] P:1679.15 E:0.079143 |  Five minutes into the second half in Canada, that will offer encouragement for Canada.
[4215.00 - 4222.00] P:1737.43 E:0.084114 |  Boyan who is being booed by the Croatian support,
[4223.00 - 4231.00] P:1404.84 E:0.077202 |  Red Star Belgrade goalkeeper as the ball played back to Gavadio.
[4231.00 - 4237.00] P:1557.70 E:0.081506 |  Gavadio holds off the challenge of David and dinks the ball onto the chest of Buchanan
[4237.00 - 4240.00] P:1595.79 E:0.079197 |  and gets a throw for his trouble as well.
[4240.00 - 4246.00] P:1533.81 E:0.084507 |  Perisic, by the way, with the assists in the first half,
[4246.00 - 4253.00] P:1698.02 E:0.093203 |  he's been involved in more goals than any other Croatian player in tournament history now.
[4253.00 - 4259.00] P:1658.88 E:0.093051 |  Nine goals and six assists as the ball now is with Alfonso Davies.
[4259.00 - 4262.00] P:1683.43 E:0.089651 |  Challenge though by Modric.
[4264.00 - 4270.00] P:1500.94 E:0.105107 |  When you see the speed at which Alfonso Davies accelerates into situations, it's unbelievable.
[4270.00 - 4274.00] P:1742.99 E:0.100730 |  The coverage is accelerating now and he passes the ball out wide.
[4274.00 - 4277.00] P:1767.25 E:0.086955 |  Horses Krameric to collect that ball on the right touch line.
[4277.00 - 4279.00] P:1837.16 E:0.087205 |  Krameric with the cross too deep.
[4279.00 - 4282.00] P:1612.86 E:0.084830 |  Perisic should come in off the left touch line.
[4282.00 - 4285.00] P:1820.97 E:0.107691 |  Here is Sosa on this near side. What an inviting ball that was.
[4285.00 - 4288.00] P:1622.02 E:0.079654 |  And it was an awkward one for the goalkeeper.
[4288.00 - 4292.00] P:1867.44 E:0.100297 |  It was dropping around knee height. He'd gone to his knees actually and it was cleared away in front of him.
[4292.00 - 4294.00] P:1692.94 E:0.081008 |  Such a teasing ball.
[4294.00 - 4298.00] P:1563.81 E:0.084474 |  It really was floated beautifully with his left foot.
[4298.00 - 4303.00] P:1528.74 E:0.085728 |  It was right in that channel. The goalkeeper had to come but really anything could have happened.
[4303.00 - 4305.00] P:1329.17 E:0.064276 |  He was just gambling.
[4305.00 - 4309.00] P:1556.90 E:0.095104 |  He wasn't connected with by the first Croatian player running across the face of the ball.
[4309.00 - 4312.00] P:1437.06 E:0.091481 |  He just fumbled it out into the penalty box.
[4312.00 - 4315.00] P:1460.88 E:0.088168 |  It's all he could do really. It was a great delivery.
[4315.00 - 4318.00] P:1731.24 E:0.091350 |  Going to be a yellow card here shown.
[4318.00 - 4324.00] P:1696.30 E:0.082059 |  And that is to Buchanan for the foul on Guardiol.
[4324.00 - 4328.00] P:1781.97 E:0.081775 |  It was a deliberate trick. Just caught him on the back of the calves.
[4328.00 - 4332.00] P:1825.00 E:0.084835 |  And the first yellow card of the game is shown to the Canadian player.
[4332.00 - 4335.00] P:1349.73 E:0.085561 |  Really cynical, wouldn't it? Just nowhere near him.
[4335.00 - 4340.00] P:1344.16 E:0.088985 |  Tripped him up and that's not the first time Guardiol has gone on a little mazy run from the back, is it?
[4340.00 - 4343.00] P:1529.99 E:0.098573 |  As you pointed out in the first half.
[4343.00 - 4347.00] P:1393.87 E:0.086230 |  Gets forward, doesn't he? Not like all centre-backs.
[4348.00 - 4350.00] P:1747.63 E:0.104159 |  Croatia have come from behind.
[4350.00 - 4353.00] P:1714.96 E:0.084218 |  Derby County have come from behind in the FA Cup second round.
[4353.00 - 4355.00] P:1743.01 E:0.085387 |  Four-county-one, Derby County two.
[4355.00 - 4359.00] P:1666.18 E:0.081179 |  Underway at Portman Road is Ipswich Books and that was a five o'clock kickoff.
[4359.00 - 4361.00] P:1733.12 E:0.080724 |  That is actually on Sports Extra as we speak.
[4361.00 - 4364.00] P:1594.88 E:0.092058 |  Aaron Paul will keep us up to date should there be a goal.
[4364.00 - 4369.00] P:1628.37 E:0.078211 |  The draw tomorrow night is seven o'clock on BBC Two television.
[4371.00 - 4373.00] P:1522.03 E:0.084823 |  Free kick out towards the right.
[4373.00 - 4376.00] P:1623.75 E:0.088059 |  Hutchinson heads it away for Canada.
[4376.00 - 4381.00] P:1621.89 E:0.068483 |  Modrich, 37 years of age.
[4381.00 - 4385.00] P:1638.41 E:0.079823 |  He was the best player in Russia four years ago.
[4385.00 - 4390.00] P:1647.81 E:0.091441 |  Whether it's he, Messi or Ronaldo, when you see these great players,
[4390.00 - 4393.00] P:1691.81 E:0.084659 |  it really is a privilege to see them in the flesh.
[4393.00 - 4395.00] P:1166.90 E:0.081636 |  Yeah, he's magnificent, isn't he?
[4395.00 - 4402.00] P:1436.22 E:0.089091 |  The ability to see passes in the way just flicks things with the outside of his boot.
[4402.00 - 4405.00] P:1493.77 E:0.091727 |  I love the passes where he just lifts things around the corner.
[4405.00 - 4409.00] P:1528.25 E:0.099424 |  Little balls over the top, he's an incredible player.
[4410.00 - 4412.00] P:1789.89 E:0.095355 |  Eight minutes into the second half.
[4412.00 - 4415.00] P:1852.37 E:0.096468 |  Canada need a response. They're treading by two goals to one.
[4415.00 - 4418.00] P:1715.66 E:0.085776 |  Modrich loses out in the midfield to Kone.
[4418.00 - 4420.00] P:1794.26 E:0.097669 |  Out it goes to Luria.
[4420.00 - 4423.00] P:1722.22 E:0.077706 |  Forward on the left-hand side.
[4423.00 - 4425.00] P:1694.70 E:0.083002 |  Two weights inside the penalty area.
[4425.00 - 4427.00] P:1956.95 E:0.100078 |  Osorio makes it three.
[4427.00 - 4429.00] P:1871.35 E:0.092965 |  Hutchinson also getting up for the back.
[4429.00 - 4431.00] P:1647.33 E:0.076238 |  Kone can't thread it through.
[4431.00 - 4433.00] P:1776.82 E:0.104817 |  They might leave themselves vulnerable now to the counterattack.
[4433.00 - 4437.00] P:1795.47 E:0.092627 |  This is Kovacic just outside the centre-circle of his own half.
[4437.00 - 4439.00] P:1605.36 E:0.094580 |  Over the half-ball, over the halfway line,
[4439.00 - 4441.00] P:1746.18 E:0.077378 |  he carries it to Sosa the left-back.
[4441.00 - 4444.00] P:1723.16 E:0.080198 |  Croatia in their red-and-white checkered shirt.
[4444.00 - 4447.00] P:1550.88 E:0.077809 |  It's a playing from right to left as we look.
[4447.00 - 4451.00] P:1364.46 E:0.081028 |  And they're into their stride now.
[4451.00 - 4453.00] P:1649.05 E:0.083155 |  And in particular this man, Modrich.
[4453.00 - 4458.00] P:1588.46 E:0.079979 |  Out it goes to Kramaric, who waits back towards Modrich once again.
[4458.00 - 4460.00] P:1584.97 E:0.098820 |  Brozovic makes himself available.
[4460.00 - 4463.00] P:1527.21 E:0.089926 |  Lovely reverse pass. They've got round the back.
[4463.00 - 4465.00] P:1749.19 E:0.101782 |  Modrich pulls it back. Kramaric again.
[4465.00 - 4467.00] P:1781.81 E:0.105547 |  Excellent save by Boyan.
[4467.00 - 4471.00] P:1755.59 E:0.104387 |  He had all the time in the world to take the right foot and shut as it was pulled back.
[4471.00 - 4474.00] P:1794.48 E:0.096257 |  And Boyan moving away to his right made the save.
[4474.00 - 4477.00] P:1680.75 E:0.078973 |  And a crucial save too.
[4477.00 - 4479.00] P:1375.23 E:0.092487 |  Beautiful move from Croatia.
[4479.00 - 4483.00] P:1575.64 E:0.093175 |  I mean, it's a pleasure watching how they're playing at the moment
[4483.00 - 4485.00] P:1393.49 E:0.091262 |  in terms of link-up play movement.
[4485.00 - 4487.00] P:1275.77 E:0.085126 |  Modrich has the ball wide.
[4487.00 - 4490.00] P:1571.76 E:0.091845 |  He drops his shoulder to fate to go one way.
[4490.00 - 4492.00] P:1465.90 E:0.091448 |  Makes the running behind.
[4492.00 - 4494.00] P:1563.12 E:0.090422 |  Brozovic exactly on the same wavelength.
[4494.00 - 4498.00] P:1447.06 E:0.086396 |  Sides that little pass inside the fallback to Modrich.
[4498.00 - 4500.00] P:1533.26 E:0.098219 |  He's then breaking into the box.
[4500.00 - 4502.00] P:1472.86 E:0.074352 |  Head up, cut back to the penalty spot.
[4502.00 - 4504.00] P:1410.69 E:0.085556 |  Deserved a goal, didn't it?
[4504.00 - 4506.00] P:1664.06 E:0.086341 |  It was a decent save. It wasn't the cleanest of strike.
[4506.00 - 4510.00] P:1582.37 E:0.087076 |  I think any power on the strike would have took it into the net, but lovely move.
[4510.00 - 4512.00] P:1883.11 E:0.093679 |  Corner's been taken short.
[4512.00 - 4514.00] P:1763.47 E:0.084833 |  Modrich to Kovacic with the back heel.
[4514.00 - 4516.00] P:1714.47 E:0.088877 |  And the cross comes in on this near side.
[4516.00 - 4518.00] P:1690.68 E:0.082891 |  Alfonso Davies is back there helping out.
[4518.00 - 4520.00] P:1760.94 E:0.091088 |  Prevents it from going behind.
[4520.00 - 4523.00] P:1666.30 E:0.091218 |  Challenge though from Modrich was an unfair one.
[4523.00 - 4526.00] P:1606.35 E:0.085262 |  Said the Uruguayan referee, Andre Matonte.
[4526.00 - 4528.00] P:1424.47 E:0.088156 |  There's that little ball there for Modrich.
[4528.00 - 4530.00] P:1452.30 E:0.084094 |  A little back heel.
[4530.00 - 4532.00] P:1744.89 E:0.097118 |  It's the outside of the right foot.
[4532.00 - 4535.00] P:1491.12 E:0.076563 |  When it goes across his body, he won't use his left foot.
[4535.00 - 4537.00] P:1514.05 E:0.093329 |  He just manages to get his right foot running.
[4537.00 - 4539.00] P:1428.16 E:0.096769 |  It's like a little scoop, isn't it?
[4539.00 - 4542.00] P:1458.92 E:0.083273 |  Into there, he gets his head up, sees where the runner is.
[4542.00 - 4546.00] P:1399.10 E:0.082351 |  He's so good when he's at that goal line, being able to pick players out.
[4546.00 - 4549.00] P:1677.33 E:0.096851 |  Didn't he do that in the Champions League last season?
[4549.00 - 4551.00] P:1726.99 E:0.088817 |  With the ball that he just flipped over?
[4551.00 - 4553.00] P:1775.49 E:0.087898 |  Yeah, unbelievable.
[4553.00 - 4555.00] P:1779.38 E:0.093626 |  Canada attacking. Osorio into the penalty area.
[4555.00 - 4557.00] P:1817.23 E:0.099276 |  Plays it back, edge of the area. Buchanan goes square.
[4557.00 - 4560.00] P:1880.27 E:0.108435 |  First-time shot comes in from Jonathan David.
[4560.00 - 4563.00] P:1715.65 E:0.097442 |  And the keeper, I think, got a touch to that.
[4563.00 - 4566.00] P:1839.33 E:0.099975 |  Meanwhile, Lovren has been shown a yellow card
[4566.00 - 4568.00] P:1898.06 E:0.109763 |  for a challenge earlier on.
[4568.00 - 4570.00] P:1733.52 E:0.077407 |  The referee played the advantage.
[4570.00 - 4573.00] P:1659.55 E:0.083644 |  That was a very good attack from Canada.
[4573.00 - 4576.00] P:1458.54 E:0.085527 |  Lovely reply from Canada, in fact.
[4576.00 - 4579.00] P:1432.86 E:0.083260 |  Good play and an essay. It's an important touch.
[4579.00 - 4582.00] P:1505.56 E:0.085287 |  The shot's going in from Jonathan David.
[4582.00 - 4585.00] P:1472.02 E:0.073268 |  He dipped and maybe hit the crossbar.
[4585.00 - 4588.00] P:1598.92 E:0.101698 |  Livakovich has to get his hand on that and steer that one over.
[4588.00 - 4590.00] P:1636.97 E:0.089427 |  But nice break away.
[4590.00 - 4593.00] P:1581.98 E:0.097282 |  Canada just letting Croatia know they're still in this game
[4593.00 - 4596.00] P:1466.49 E:0.096451 |  and they're able to do damage if need be.
[4597.00 - 4601.00] P:1602.13 E:0.097714 |  Lovren was shown the yellow card.
[4601.00 - 4604.00] P:1522.23 E:0.081215 |  Hutchinson had gone off the field of play.
[4604.00 - 4608.00] P:1725.01 E:0.082549 |  He's come back on with a swab stuffed up one of his nostrils.
[4608.00 - 4612.00] P:1725.20 E:0.085774 |  There's nothing materialised from the corner kick.
[4613.00 - 4616.00] P:1611.55 E:0.083086 |  A swab stuffed up a nostril.
[4616.00 - 4619.00] P:1734.98 E:0.102225 |  And it was kind of... Oh, yeah, I can see.
[4619.00 - 4621.00] P:1796.39 E:0.109638 |  Just like hanging down as well.
[4621.00 - 4624.00] P:1594.45 E:0.066085 |  Must have got a bang to the nose.
[4624.00 - 4626.00] P:1464.09 E:0.090614 |  Off the ball, maybe. I didn't see that happen, did you?
[4626.00 - 4628.00] P:1544.79 E:0.078614 |  No, I didn't. The referee did.
[4628.00 - 4630.00] P:1756.66 E:0.084781 |  As soon as the ball went out of play,
[4630.00 - 4633.00] P:1710.60 E:0.104043 |  the Uruguayan official gave the yellow card to Lovren.
[4633.00 - 4635.00] P:1529.45 E:0.064305 |  Lovren's been booked.
[4635.00 - 4637.00] P:1779.19 E:0.098379 |  I can only imagine it was for that.
[4637.00 - 4639.00] P:1794.61 E:0.081660 |  12 minutes into the second half.
[4641.00 - 4644.00] P:1648.57 E:0.099438 |  And Croatia leading by two goals to one.
[4645.00 - 4649.00] P:1562.63 E:0.082131 |  Don't forget, Rick Edwards is out here for five live breakfast in Qatar.
[4649.00 - 4652.00] P:1485.05 E:0.087237 |  He'll be alongside Rachel, not literally,
[4652.00 - 4654.00] P:1571.72 E:0.092785 |  from six in the morning tomorrow.
[4654.00 - 4656.00] P:1627.59 E:0.092545 |  Final day of morning action.
[4656.00 - 4659.00] P:1657.65 E:0.081624 |  Now coverage once more will start at nine o'clock.
[4659.00 - 4661.00] P:1662.24 E:0.096676 |  First game of four tomorrow.
[4661.00 - 4664.00] P:1631.74 E:0.065250 |  Cameroon against Serbia at ten o'clock.
[4664.00 - 4666.00] P:1710.37 E:0.084539 |  We've still got Spain against Germany.
[4666.00 - 4670.00] P:1816.01 E:0.103334 |  Oh, that was a loose ball by Boyan, straight to Perisic with the cross.
[4670.00 - 4672.00] P:1728.08 E:0.088480 |  But it goes straight towards the goalkeeper.
[4672.00 - 4675.00] P:1639.34 E:0.089594 |  He returns the ball to the Canadian,
[4675.00 - 4678.00] P:1541.17 E:0.086154 |  who now throws it out underarm to Buchanan,
[4678.00 - 4680.00] P:1595.13 E:0.085251 |  who sends Alfonso Davies away,
[4680.00 - 4683.00] P:1699.10 E:0.088227 |  teetering down the touchline, right-hand side,
[4683.00 - 4686.00] P:1687.36 E:0.085028 |  cuts in play, into the area, back towards Buchanan,
[4686.00 - 4688.00] P:1815.65 E:0.097290 |  shot charged down by the heels,
[4688.00 - 4692.00] P:1630.12 E:0.071422 |  across a bit, Kramaric back there, helping out.
[4692.00 - 4694.00] P:1681.52 E:0.086375 |  I mean, there will become a point, Matt,
[4694.00 - 4696.00] P:1818.56 E:0.099336 |  where Canada will throw caution to the wind,
[4696.00 - 4699.00] P:1670.81 E:0.076038 |  commit those black shirts forward,
[4699.00 - 4701.00] P:1666.09 E:0.078879 |  but then they run the risk of conceding more goals.
[4701.00 - 4703.00] P:1705.06 E:0.098604 |  Yeah, we may be not quite there yet,
[4703.00 - 4707.00] P:1457.26 E:0.087997 |  but we're not too many minutes away from that having to be the tactics,
[4707.00 - 4711.00] P:1206.10 E:0.082730 |  and they're going to rely so heavily on Alfonso Davies.
[4711.00 - 4713.00] P:1397.07 E:0.081771 |  I mean, he keeps balls in play
[4713.00 - 4715.00] P:1423.39 E:0.086725 |  that just look like they're going out of play, doesn't he?
[4715.00 - 4719.00] P:1445.92 E:0.094976 |  He's got this amazing kind of turner pace to get hold of something.
[4719.00 - 4727.00] P:1630.03 E:0.083991 |  Matt Upsen, an experience of scoring at a World Cup for England,
[4727.00 - 4730.00] P:1731.62 E:0.097442 |  12 years ago in Bloom-Fontaine,
[4730.00 - 4734.00] P:1700.27 E:0.093162 |  who's part of our five-live team here in Qatar,
[4734.00 - 4738.00] P:1616.65 E:0.077513 |  Canada with the ball.
[4738.00 - 4740.00] P:1818.22 E:0.083405 |  Alfonso Davies, though,
[4740.00 - 4742.00] P:1801.13 E:0.098724 |  dispossessed in the midfield by Kovacic,
[4742.00 - 4745.00] P:1698.79 E:0.079745 |  nice turn from the Chelsea man with his experience.
[4745.00 - 4748.00] P:1864.30 E:0.098194 |  He just teed it forward towards Sosa, the left back.
[4748.00 - 4751.00] P:1718.62 E:0.094728 |  We've gone too far ahead of him on this near side, the left,
[4751.00 - 4753.00] P:1770.38 E:0.085049 |  and they've lost the ball,
[4753.00 - 4756.00] P:1708.59 E:0.082691 |  and Hutchinson now will try and attack that gap that has been vacated,
[4756.00 - 4759.00] P:1793.14 E:0.081977 |  but Gwadial just dropped across to cover,
[4759.00 - 4763.00] P:1746.04 E:0.081604 |  and then with Perisic, they've dealt with that very, very well.
[4763.00 - 4765.00] P:1757.30 E:0.092791 |  Yeah, good cover from Croatia,
[4765.00 - 4767.00] P:1653.82 E:0.087330 |  because Hutchinson just nutmegged Gwadial then,
[4767.00 - 4770.00] P:1589.27 E:0.086162 |  didn't get it the other side because he just got his body across and blocked him,
[4770.00 - 4772.00] P:1478.99 E:0.091653 |  but a little bit of a 1v1,
[4772.00 - 4777.00] P:1497.50 E:0.081766 |  and I think Croatia just starting to realise that sooner or later,
[4777.00 - 4779.00] P:1504.77 E:0.087106 |  like we just mentioned,
[4779.00 - 4781.00] P:1556.56 E:0.100340 |  Canada are going to really go for this game,
[4781.00 - 4783.00] P:1521.60 E:0.090693 |  and they're going to have to be ready defensively
[4783.00 - 4785.00] P:1468.53 E:0.066433 |  and then try and hit them on that counterattack.
[4785.00 - 4787.00] P:1576.00 E:0.085899 |  They certainly will attack,
[4787.00 - 4791.00] P:1707.22 E:0.087807 |  they'll look to go forward, they'll look to get something from it.
[4791.00 - 4795.00] P:1834.13 E:0.107419 |  He's got an opportunity to always try and prove people wrong,
[4795.00 - 4798.00] P:1838.73 E:0.105084 |  John Herdman, as the boos and whistles grow ever louder
[4798.00 - 4803.00] P:1493.98 E:0.055591 |  for Milan Bojan,
[4803.00 - 4807.00] P:1670.26 E:0.088283 |  from the Croatian supporters directed towards the Canadian keeper.
[4807.00 - 4810.00] P:1706.51 E:0.096843 |  Here is Lvivajer, taking off his toes by Vittoria,
[4810.00 - 4814.00] P:1692.89 E:0.074572 |  but it's not going to be Herdman who's going to be making a change.
[4814.00 - 4817.00] P:1788.17 E:0.085908 |  Instead, it is going to be Zlatko Dalic,
[4817.00 - 4819.00] P:1778.98 E:0.088824 |  who's going to make the change,
[4819.00 - 4823.00] P:1511.63 E:0.070441 |  and the player who's going to be coming on
[4823.00 - 4827.00] P:1694.36 E:0.089360 |  is going to be Bruno Petkovic,
[4827.00 - 4831.00] P:1682.56 E:0.088254 |  who's a forward for Dino Mozagreb,
[4831.00 - 4835.00] P:1700.65 E:0.079758 |  and Lvivajer, who got the second goal,
[4835.00 - 4839.00] P:1656.00 E:0.075468 |  is the player who goes off, so it's like for like.
[4839.00 - 4843.00] P:1409.29 E:0.086788 |  He's done well, Lvivajer, been impressed with him,
[4843.00 - 4846.00] P:1562.57 E:0.095518 |  got a good domestic goal record at the moment,
[4846.00 - 4848.00] P:1623.43 E:0.099108 |  which I think is why that change has been made,
[4848.00 - 4852.00] P:1507.05 E:0.095421 |  because Croatia, not looking too hot up front in the first game,
[4852.00 - 4854.00] P:1503.82 E:0.093428 |  I think only two shots on target,
[4854.00 - 4856.00] P:1282.03 E:0.088654 |  lots of little creative situations,
[4856.00 - 4858.00] P:1551.06 E:0.100549 |  but no real cutting edge,
[4858.00 - 4860.00] P:1481.19 E:0.093500 |  and he's brought a little bit of that today,
[4860.00 - 4863.00] P:1370.13 E:0.078707 |  and that's to be said, took his goal excellently.
[4863.00 - 4865.00] P:1469.98 E:0.063270 |  He certainly did.
[4865.00 - 4867.00] P:1704.56 E:0.100354 |  He just goes up and has a little handshake,
[4867.00 - 4871.00] P:1637.68 E:0.070569 |  and then a hook from Zlatko Dalic.
[4871.00 - 4874.00] P:1654.85 E:0.087423 |  Quite stocky, wasn't he, Lvivajer?
[4874.00 - 4877.00] P:1456.72 E:0.074832 |  Yeah, he certainly was.
[4877.00 - 4879.00] P:1687.98 E:0.105721 |  But as you say, that goal just before half-time
[4879.00 - 4883.00] P:1534.20 E:0.069999 |  to give Croatia this freshest lead.
[4883.00 - 4887.00] P:1410.11 E:0.085598 |  I actually like Kramaric wider of the three as well.
[4887.00 - 4891.00] P:1408.25 E:0.087504 |  I think that suits him, that role, because he's really pacey.
[4891.00 - 4893.00] P:1369.29 E:0.096402 |  He doesn't mind the 1v1 situations,
[4893.00 - 4895.00] P:1432.48 E:0.094115 |  not just one of these players that's in the box
[4895.00 - 4897.00] P:1445.83 E:0.081979 |  and likes to go on the end of things,
[4897.00 - 4900.00] P:1491.03 E:0.086229 |  which I think Lvivajer is more that out-and-out kind of striker
[4900.00 - 4902.00] P:1585.80 E:0.092269 |  that likes to stay central.
[4902.00 - 4905.00] P:1496.96 E:0.096185 |  I think Kramaric has looked good in wide areas here.
[4905.00 - 4910.00] P:1706.43 E:0.082767 |  Vardiole again with another well-timed sliding challenge,
[4910.00 - 4914.00] P:1537.41 E:0.072953 |  and it will go out for a throw,
[4914.00 - 4917.00] P:1869.15 E:0.083495 |  because Davies had skipped over the first challenge.
[4917.00 - 4920.00] P:1808.98 E:0.085225 |  Now, we've said that they've made the changes at half-time,
[4920.00 - 4922.00] P:1805.83 E:0.075979 |  and they've still got other opportunities.
[4922.00 - 4926.00] P:1841.70 E:0.080948 |  Here is another one of those for Canada,
[4926.00 - 4929.00] P:1741.29 E:0.088942 |  and it is Luria who comes off,
[4929.00 - 4932.00] P:1774.90 E:0.076204 |  and it's junior Hoylert,
[4932.00 - 4935.00] P:1692.57 E:0.089180 |  the ex-Blackburn Queensport Rangers and Cardiff player
[4935.00 - 4938.00] P:1624.15 E:0.099560 |  who's going to be coming on now at Reading, of course,
[4938.00 - 4941.00] P:1624.87 E:0.074408 |  for his 48th cap.
[4941.00 - 4946.00] P:1614.44 E:0.099709 |  So Hoylert is on, and Canada have been awarded a free kick
[4946.00 - 4951.00] P:1564.94 E:0.081985 |  quite close to the right corner of the penalty area.
[4951.00 - 4954.00] P:1420.14 E:0.067802 |  I mean, it looks like Buchanan has gone over
[4954.00 - 4956.00] P:1490.39 E:0.100306 |  to the left wing-back position, I think,
[4956.00 - 4958.00] P:1429.89 E:0.088002 |  from how that started.
[4958.00 - 4963.00] P:1615.84 E:0.084395 |  I look at the replay on Davies,
[4963.00 - 4965.00] P:1544.93 E:0.096333 |  and he's given a foul away,
[4965.00 - 4968.00] P:1702.49 E:0.103655 |  and it's literally right on the corner of the 18-yard box,
[4968.00 - 4972.00] P:1657.82 E:0.094803 |  and this is dangerous territory for somebody with his kind of left foot.
[4972.00 - 4974.00] P:1726.25 E:0.092917 |  If he gets a good delivery in the box,
[4974.00 - 4976.00] P:1744.18 E:0.090875 |  I don't know if he's going to shoot a goal,
[4976.00 - 4978.00] P:1688.01 E:0.096696 |  but is Taylor made for any kind of Canadian players
[4978.00 - 4980.00] P:1622.37 E:0.095597 |  running across the face of this ball
[4980.00 - 4985.00] P:1578.87 E:0.084180 |  can make life very different for Liverkowicz and Goldfoot Croatia?
[4985.00 - 4987.00] P:1651.47 E:0.086429 |  Canada are playing from left to right.
[4987.00 - 4989.00] P:1934.76 E:0.100143 |  They're trailing by two goals to one.
[4989.00 - 4992.00] P:1655.93 E:0.078729 |  It's a free kick, right corner of the area.
[4992.00 - 4994.00] P:1833.00 E:0.099513 |  Alfonso Davies did go for goal,
[4994.00 - 4996.00] P:1826.92 E:0.096761 |  and he's struck the leg to the three-man wall.
[4996.00 - 4998.00] P:1593.90 E:0.083304 |  Out of play, it goes for a throw.
[4998.00 - 5000.00] P:1478.19 E:0.088271 |  They're trying to go underneath the wall, though.
[5000.00 - 5002.00] P:1604.09 E:0.105233 |  It looked like he went to try and go low
[5002.00 - 5004.00] P:1734.76 E:0.077474 |  and into that near post area,
[5004.00 - 5007.00] P:1561.08 E:0.038495 |  hoping that the Croatian wall would jump.
[5007.00 - 5010.00] P:1604.91 E:0.087999 |  Remember, though, when we were talking about Cavadio,
[5010.00 - 5012.00] P:1799.43 E:0.089580 |  it was around transfer deadline day,
[5012.00 - 5016.00] P:1561.76 E:0.084293 |  and we had Christopher Vival on from Leipzig.
[5016.00 - 5018.00] P:1656.00 E:0.102861 |  I think the sporting director,
[5018.00 - 5021.00] P:1691.00 E:0.097779 |  he'll be moving to Chelsea very, very soon,
[5021.00 - 5023.00] P:1741.85 E:0.088946 |  if he hasn't already.
[5023.00 - 5025.00] P:1736.98 E:0.098043 |  I remember asking him about Cavadio,
[5025.00 - 5029.00] P:1628.18 E:0.086788 |  and he said he will become the best central defender in the world,
[5029.00 - 5030.00] P:1702.31 E:0.079207 |  which was...
[5030.00 - 5031.00] P:1376.37 E:0.098831 |  It's quite an endorsement.
[5031.00 - 5032.00] P:1556.12 E:0.082641 |  It is, yeah.
[5032.00 - 5034.00] P:1346.74 E:0.077262 |  And certainly would...
[5036.00 - 5040.00] P:1747.46 E:0.091272 |  help, I would imagine, if Chelsea were to pursue their interest
[5040.00 - 5042.00] P:1808.42 E:0.105869 |  in the Leipzig defender.
[5042.00 - 5045.00] P:1754.86 E:0.091112 |  They signed in for £16 million from Dino Mope.
[5046.00 - 5049.00] P:1586.86 E:0.074518 |  He looks very good, then, I have to say.
[5049.00 - 5051.00] P:1567.49 E:0.087786 |  You know, he's...
[5051.00 - 5055.00] P:1749.24 E:0.089287 |  very mobile, faster across the ground.
[5055.00 - 5057.00] P:1680.07 E:0.083896 |  Gets forward as well.
[5059.00 - 5062.00] P:1439.64 E:0.080469 |  We've been playing for over an hour,
[5063.00 - 5067.00] P:1425.08 E:0.080531 |  and Croatia are leading 2-1.
[5067.00 - 5070.00] P:1538.34 E:0.084354 |  Canada are facing elimination
[5070.00 - 5075.00] P:1573.16 E:0.090574 |  in the first World Cup finals in the men's tournament since 1986.
[5076.00 - 5078.00] P:1662.04 E:0.097516 |  Croatia with Modric, right-hand side.
[5079.00 - 5085.00] P:1546.60 E:0.088450 |  Modric tries to get away from the challenge over on that far side.
[5085.00 - 5088.00] P:1587.30 E:0.083132 |  It was Osorio who was back there helping out,
[5088.00 - 5091.00] P:1459.09 E:0.068218 |  and Lovren plays it back to Cavadio,
[5091.00 - 5093.00] P:1779.69 E:0.089098 |  who Richard had been talking about.
[5093.00 - 5096.00] P:1637.34 E:0.080978 |  It just feels an element of control
[5096.00 - 5098.00] P:1726.46 E:0.096816 |  that Croatia have in this game at the moment.
[5098.00 - 5103.00] P:1323.32 E:0.086320 |  Yeah, they've had it probably since about 20 minutes into the game,
[5103.00 - 5104.00] P:1412.11 E:0.109355 |  I would say.
[5104.00 - 5106.00] P:1404.01 E:0.087011 |  They didn't open particularly well,
[5106.00 - 5110.00] P:1428.60 E:0.081131 |  but since then, and maybe the goal going in
[5110.00 - 5113.00] P:1609.81 E:0.079648 |  is just giving them a little shake-up to say,
[5113.00 - 5115.00] P:1343.96 E:0.101723 |  right, we need to step it up here, guys,
[5115.00 - 5118.00] P:1374.28 E:0.080668 |  and I think the whole team generally has done that.
[5118.00 - 5122.00] P:1467.27 E:0.086226 |  They've looked very much in control, slick passing moves,
[5122.00 - 5125.00] P:1319.04 E:0.091963 |  and they've competed a lot, lot better, which they were struggling.
[5125.00 - 5128.00] P:1538.67 E:0.092509 |  They gave Canada too much space early on,
[5128.00 - 5132.00] P:1402.61 E:0.086431 |  and they got exploited and hats off to how they've reacted,
[5132.00 - 5135.00] P:1340.80 E:0.076165 |  and I think they've put in a good team performance since then.
[5135.00 - 5137.00] P:1633.75 E:0.089650 |  Well, certainly they're in a good run of form.
[5137.00 - 5141.00] P:1780.86 E:0.095937 |  They've only lost one of their last 17 matches of Croatia.
[5141.00 - 5144.00] P:1490.67 E:0.074582 |  That was against Austria in June.
[5144.00 - 5148.00] P:1621.15 E:0.087230 |  Perisic with the throw on this left-hand side.
[5148.00 - 5151.00] P:1842.83 E:0.083651 |  It just helps it on its way towards Kovacic,
[5151.00 - 5152.00] P:1396.66 E:0.074981 |  effective in the midfield.
[5152.00 - 5154.00] P:1555.16 E:0.089353 |  That was a nice little back heel.
[5155.00 - 5157.00] P:1777.24 E:0.102042 |  Perisic and Kovacic linking up,
[5157.00 - 5160.00] P:1675.45 E:0.089658 |  and they get another throw on this new side of the left.
[5160.00 - 5163.00] P:1701.74 E:0.082923 |  65 minutes we have played so far
[5163.00 - 5166.00] P:1654.20 E:0.081352 |  in the Kaleepa International Stadium.
[5169.00 - 5174.00] P:1314.64 E:0.079720 |  And waiting to take this throw is Perisic,
[5174.00 - 5177.00] P:1697.98 E:0.093814 |  and it goes now over the head of Petkovic.
[5177.00 - 5180.00] P:1572.52 E:0.090961 |  Hoylert linking up with Alfonso Davies,
[5180.00 - 5181.00] P:1764.53 E:0.093448 |  then it breaks down.
[5181.00 - 5185.00] P:1501.00 E:0.077828 |  Guardiol likes to get forward at every opportunity.
[5185.00 - 5189.00] P:1650.27 E:0.089638 |  It was his low ball in from the left that has been bowled out by Boyan.
[5189.00 - 5192.00] P:1823.72 E:0.089408 |  Canada has just appeared to have lost their way.
[5192.00 - 5195.00] P:1461.59 E:0.097151 |  They're not putting anything together at all at the moment.
[5195.00 - 5197.00] P:1454.98 E:0.076921 |  I know they've made some substitutions.
[5197.00 - 5201.00] P:1501.51 E:0.084061 |  Sometimes that can just unsettle things a little bit,
[5201.00 - 5203.00] P:1400.55 E:0.086956 |  but they're sat in their shape at the moment.
[5203.00 - 5204.00] P:1196.54 E:0.087108 |  But in terms of attacking-wise,
[5204.00 - 5207.00] P:1300.73 E:0.087557 |  they probably had one real opportunity they've put together
[5207.00 - 5209.00] P:1374.27 E:0.088503 |  that has come from a good piece of play,
[5209.00 - 5212.00] P:1442.00 E:0.091804 |  where they've had possession and developed a situation.
[5212.00 - 5214.00] P:1393.48 E:0.083669 |  But other than that, in this second half,
[5214.00 - 5217.00] P:1489.80 E:0.093425 |  they've really struggled to really string passes together
[5217.00 - 5218.00] P:1253.61 E:0.093723 |  and get up the pitch.
[5218.00 - 5221.00] P:1553.79 E:0.069934 |  Alfonso Davies turns.
[5222.00 - 5226.00] P:1645.74 E:0.091929 |  He finds Kone in the central point midway through the Croatia half.
[5226.00 - 5229.00] P:1697.22 E:0.092308 |  That was excellent defending by Juranovic.
[5229.00 - 5232.00] P:1792.87 E:0.088443 |  He read that through himself at it, sliding forward,
[5232.00 - 5235.00] P:1657.17 E:0.080265 |  clattered it out of play for a throw that Canada will take.
[5235.00 - 5238.00] P:1652.99 E:0.090810 |  But we're approaching the midway point of the second half here
[5238.00 - 5240.00] P:1638.85 E:0.092252 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[5242.00 - 5246.00] P:1548.00 E:0.084565 |  And it's Croatia who still have the slender lead.
[5246.00 - 5249.00] P:1554.10 E:0.082779 |  This is Hoylert being forced back by Sosa,
[5249.00 - 5252.00] P:1647.99 E:0.084686 |  the left-back, forcing him back over the halfway line.
[5252.00 - 5255.00] P:1720.33 E:0.079974 |  Hutchinson drops in between the central defenders.
[5255.00 - 5259.00] P:1740.19 E:0.083007 |  Milano hits a left-footed ball up towards Buchanan,
[5259.00 - 5263.00] P:1722.41 E:0.092826 |  who's now popped up on the left-hand side, and he gets a throw.
[5263.00 - 5266.00] P:1539.49 E:0.078961 |  He's taken over that left-wing-back position since the last change,
[5266.00 - 5269.00] P:1502.83 E:0.084450 |  and I think Hoylert is playing a lot higher,
[5269.00 - 5271.00] P:1685.03 E:0.089321 |  maybe just off the front, too.
[5274.00 - 5278.00] P:1536.41 E:0.093599 |  Here is Vittoria in the centre-circle along the ground.
[5278.00 - 5281.00] P:1667.74 E:0.079986 |  Johnston has gone into a central area.
[5281.00 - 5284.00] P:1509.78 E:0.090405 |  He's been given away easily read by Modric,
[5284.00 - 5288.00] P:1686.73 E:0.092379 |  who glides over the surface, shrugs off the one challenge,
[5288.00 - 5294.00] P:1603.47 E:0.087134 |  plays the ball to Petkovic, who was behind Kramaric,
[5294.00 - 5296.00] P:1795.45 E:0.104358 |  who looks a little annoyed at the ball.
[5296.00 - 5300.00] P:1654.06 E:0.078684 |  It would have been a decent attack for Croatia until it broke down.
[5300.00 - 5304.00] P:1612.08 E:0.087303 |  Now, all of a sudden, there's a chance to try and get Alfonso Davies away,
[5304.00 - 5307.00] P:1588.54 E:0.094687 |  but that was again bred very, very well by Kovadil.
[5307.00 - 5309.00] P:1678.25 E:0.083637 |  It was brilliant. He's been outstanding.
[5309.00 - 5311.00] P:1629.37 E:0.087072 |  Yeah, that was brilliant. That was trouble.
[5311.00 - 5316.00] P:1493.73 E:0.085452 |  When Alfonso Davies spins off you and there's space in behind,
[5316.00 - 5319.00] P:1304.21 E:0.084358 |  you have to cut that ball out, otherwise you're finished.
[5319.00 - 5324.00] P:1653.57 E:0.085325 |  You're not catching him at that moment, and he reads the line of the ball.
[5324.00 - 5328.00] P:1639.66 E:0.084093 |  You can criticise the pass to say, lift it, take it out,
[5328.00 - 5330.00] P:1524.97 E:0.090678 |  don't allow Kovadil to make that interception,
[5330.00 - 5333.00] P:1574.99 E:0.078451 |  but the space was there, they thought they could thread it between,
[5333.00 - 5336.00] P:1613.68 E:0.094444 |  and he really stepped across early and read the situation.
[5336.00 - 5339.00] P:1757.52 E:0.096413 |  Excellent play by Kovadil. He was getting challenged.
[5339.00 - 5341.00] P:1650.85 E:0.092965 |  He retained his balance. He stumbled a little bit,
[5341.00 - 5344.00] P:1655.04 E:0.093711 |  but the forward ball to Petkovic was always away from him,
[5344.00 - 5348.00] P:1771.43 E:0.088014 |  and Bojan was sliding away off his goal line. Good anticipation.
[5348.00 - 5352.00] P:1658.73 E:0.083479 |  So, Canada, looking for an equaliser after taking a very quick lead here
[5352.00 - 5355.00] P:1644.05 E:0.081412 |  in the Khalifa International Stadium.
[5355.00 - 5361.00] P:1587.60 E:0.077651 |  Goal officially timed at 67 seconds to make a change.
[5361.00 - 5364.00] P:1410.19 E:0.092542 |  That had still got 68 written down on my note pad in front of me.
[5364.00 - 5367.00] P:1491.77 E:0.074732 |  Out it goes now to Hoyler.
[5367.00 - 5371.00] P:1652.69 E:0.091354 |  On this right-hand side, but so many Croatian shirts.
[5371.00 - 5374.00] P:1517.46 E:0.080635 |  The red and white checkered shirts were back there,
[5374.00 - 5380.00] P:1342.95 E:0.083916 |  preventing him from going through, and it's been played back by Kone.
[5380.00 - 5384.00] P:1634.27 E:0.089970 |  Bojan comes out of his penalty area, his forward ball,
[5384.00 - 5390.00] P:1369.83 E:0.069013 |  Miller in the centre circle, and not really going anywhere at the moment.
[5390.00 - 5394.00] P:1636.65 E:0.074998 |  Miller decides to charge forward from defence,
[5394.00 - 5397.00] P:1802.06 E:0.094104 |  but they've given the ball away, and that now could mean problems,
[5397.00 - 5400.00] P:1769.31 E:0.083126 |  because Miller is so far forward. Kramaric turns back towards Moderic.
[5400.00 - 5403.00] P:1751.16 E:0.086884 |  Kramaric should then have made a run-off Hutchinson.
[5403.00 - 5405.00] P:1794.15 E:0.082677 |  He's still in mark now. Petkovic is offside.
[5405.00 - 5409.00] P:1648.87 E:0.081890 |  They have to be careful here, Croatia, as the ball goes out to Perishic
[5409.00 - 5412.00] P:1877.27 E:0.099949 |  on this near side, the left, still leading by two goals to one.
[5412.00 - 5417.00] P:1835.41 E:0.087866 |  He cuts inside. It's the cross, and this is an opportunity for Kramaric,
[5417.00 - 5421.00] P:1874.56 E:0.108173 |  and he's taken it. Brilliant touch from Kramaric,
[5421.00 - 5428.00] P:1793.55 E:0.099538 |  and the finish as well into the bottom left-hand corner was very, very neat.
[5428.00 - 5434.00] P:1708.42 E:0.103978 |  And now they have daylight, and Canada are facing elimination,
[5434.00 - 5440.00] P:1729.03 E:0.098587 |  because Croatia lead Canada by three goals to one,
[5440.00 - 5442.00] P:1702.44 E:0.101683 |  and what a fine goal it was too.
[5442.00 - 5445.00] P:1538.50 E:0.100375 |  You have to congratulate the quality of this goal.
[5445.00 - 5451.00] P:1554.64 E:0.098589 |  You really do. It's just a brilliant, brilliant finish from Kramaric.
[5451.00 - 5454.00] P:1473.90 E:0.094404 |  The build-up plays nice. The cross into the box,
[5454.00 - 5458.00] P:1557.27 E:0.093963 |  but his first touch is absolutely different class.
[5458.00 - 5460.00] P:1521.25 E:0.095086 |  It just sets up the whole chance.
[5460.00 - 5465.00] P:1528.26 E:0.097625 |  It's peeled off to the back post, and he receives the ball on his right foot,
[5465.00 - 5470.00] P:1576.96 E:0.096258 |  but it's almost like a half-volley controlled touch onto his left foot,
[5470.00 - 5475.00] P:1670.70 E:0.093784 |  and he then just guides it really cautiously, just controlled,
[5475.00 - 5478.00] P:1467.74 E:0.101515 |  and he might go through the legs of one of the players,
[5478.00 - 5482.00] P:1388.95 E:0.097515 |  but he knows exactly whereabouts he wants to feed that ball with his left foot,
[5482.00 - 5484.00] P:1381.64 E:0.085877 |  bends it into the far post.
[5484.00 - 5487.00] P:1503.01 E:0.087300 |  Absolutely no chance for Boyan in goal.
[5487.00 - 5490.00] P:1483.02 E:0.085636 |  He can get nowhere near it, but the first touch there, no.
[5490.00 - 5492.00] P:1442.55 E:0.075496 |  It's an absolute spot on, wasn't it?
[5492.00 - 5498.00] P:1509.77 E:0.081367 |  Yeah, certainly was. Former Leicester City player.
[5498.00 - 5504.00] P:1682.76 E:0.091545 |  What was it? 20 appearances and four goals at Leicester in the season of 15-16.
[5504.00 - 5506.00] P:1879.78 E:0.107386 |  They're looking for more goals here.
[5506.00 - 5510.00] P:1676.80 E:0.100308 |  It was a low crossing from the right-hand side from Kramaric.
[5510.00 - 5512.00] P:1605.40 E:0.086857 |  Kramaric was on the end of it.
[5512.00 - 5517.00] P:1712.86 E:0.099405 |  We've seen the quickest goal here tonight in this World Cup so far,
[5517.00 - 5522.00] P:1681.60 E:0.096910 |  and we were probably around centimetres away from him connecting,
[5522.00 - 5524.00] P:1699.99 E:0.097008 |  as he threw himself at it,
[5524.00 - 5527.00] P:1811.04 E:0.088828 |  but maybe even seen the first hat-trick at this World Cup.
[5527.00 - 5530.00] P:1611.60 E:0.086794 |  I mean, it'd be some performance if he did get that hat-trick.
[5530.00 - 5533.00] P:1743.89 E:0.087529 |  He's been very good, and like I've touched on before,
[5533.00 - 5536.00] P:1746.57 E:0.087439 |  I've really enjoyed seeing him in a wider area.
[5536.00 - 5538.00] P:1690.23 E:0.084826 |  He's got a good turn of pace, then, I know.
[5538.00 - 5542.00] P:1551.56 E:0.086402 |  He's very mobile, and I think he suits that ability to go wide
[5542.00 - 5544.00] P:1417.72 E:0.087851 |  and then arrive into the box.
[5544.00 - 5545.00] P:1352.26 E:0.079231 |  He's done very well.
[5545.00 - 5549.00] P:1445.46 E:0.077475 |  I don't think he's going to get his hat-trick, though, from what I can see.
[5549.00 - 5553.00] P:1582.54 E:0.086957 |  Well, first he's walking towards the touchline at the moment.
[5553.00 - 5556.00] P:1736.90 E:0.088474 |  Yeah, he is going to be coming off.
[5556.00 - 5560.00] P:1729.97 E:0.094274 |  Meanwhile, Canada have made a double change,
[5560.00 - 5562.00] P:1888.16 E:0.094244 |  and they've used all five substitutes now,
[5562.00 - 5568.00] P:1656.89 E:0.091370 |  because the equation for Canada in these 18 minutes that remain
[5568.00 - 5570.00] P:1677.78 E:0.081303 |  is that they've got to score two goals,
[5570.00 - 5572.00] P:1963.25 E:0.110788 |  and hopefully they don't concede any more.
[5574.00 - 5576.00] P:1869.15 E:0.095330 |  Otherwise, they're going out.
[5576.00 - 5579.00] P:1668.78 E:0.084959 |  So, Arakube has come on,
[5580.00 - 5583.00] P:1414.32 E:0.098710 |  and Cavalini has come on.
[5583.00 - 5585.00] P:1702.62 E:0.103712 |  Cavalini has replaced Jonathan David,
[5585.00 - 5590.00] P:1611.86 E:0.097830 |  so Lucas Cavalini of Vancouver Whitecaps replaces the Leal forward,
[5590.00 - 5595.00] P:1647.82 E:0.091232 |  and Hutchinson has gone off the Centurion for Canada,
[5595.00 - 5598.00] P:1715.25 E:0.094582 |  so he's been replaced by Atacube,
[5598.00 - 5603.00] P:1642.68 E:0.082168 |  and then the Croatia change was Nicola Vlasic has come on for Kramaric.
[5603.00 - 5606.00] P:1673.02 E:0.082276 |  He was a doubt with a calf problem,
[5606.00 - 5611.00] P:1408.89 E:0.069156 |  so former West Ham and Everton player
[5611.00 - 5616.00] P:1578.42 E:0.078705 |  who started the last game getting a run out for these closing 17 minutes
[5616.00 - 5621.00] P:1652.65 E:0.089449 |  of normal time, where Croatia are leading by three goals to one.
[5621.00 - 5624.00] P:1568.89 E:0.090446 |  I think what's interesting as well, when you look at the game as a whole
[5624.00 - 5626.00] P:1418.33 E:0.075917 |  and Canada's performance as well,
[5626.00 - 5632.00] P:1464.73 E:0.080441 |  is whether or not the physicality of the match in their first game,
[5632.00 - 5634.00] P:1622.18 E:0.104104 |  they gave everything, didn't they?
[5634.00 - 5637.00] P:1472.79 E:0.093289 |  They've looked a little bit flatter, a little bit lower energy in this match, haven't they?
[5637.00 - 5639.00] P:1358.93 E:0.091949 |  Especially in the second half, I think,
[5639.00 - 5642.00] P:1575.48 E:0.096569 |  you're playing against an experienced side of Croatia,
[5642.00 - 5646.00] P:1326.54 E:0.090318 |  who have been to the end levels time and time again
[5646.00 - 5650.00] P:1314.47 E:0.086820 |  in terms of tournament football and extra time and all the rest of it.
[5650.00 - 5653.00] P:1390.14 E:0.098858 |  Four years ago, their fitness was one of their key assets,
[5653.00 - 5657.00] P:1271.91 E:0.089678 |  wasn't there as a team, Croatia? They were brilliant.
[5657.00 - 5660.00] P:1399.75 E:0.086966 |  And that has shown in this match a little bit today.
[5660.00 - 5665.00] P:1533.71 E:0.097138 |  Well, you think that Belgian game, after 32 minutes, they've fired in 12 shots,
[5665.00 - 5669.00] P:1709.98 E:0.086487 |  they've finished with 22 shots at the Belgian goal.
[5669.00 - 5672.00] P:1791.36 E:0.098913 |  Only three were on target, mind, as the cross comes in for Canada.
[5672.00 - 5677.00] P:1792.74 E:0.091810 |  Alfonso Davies, Buchanan was there, didn't stick out a left leg,
[5677.00 - 5679.00] P:1807.01 E:0.099876 |  and in the end it was Livikovic, the goalkeeper,
[5679.00 - 5681.00] P:1804.68 E:0.091242 |  but the flag was up on this near side anyway,
[5681.00 - 5683.00] P:1760.63 E:0.085120 |  it wouldn't have counted, he was offside.
[5683.00 - 5688.00] P:1646.13 E:0.076622 |  But they just haven't been able to replicate that intensity.
[5688.00 - 5692.00] P:1466.02 E:0.091103 |  No, but it's hard if you can be in danger of punching yourself out, can't you?
[5692.00 - 5696.00] P:1579.02 E:0.084815 |  And I like you say, they threw a lot of punches in that first game,
[5696.00 - 5700.00] P:1547.49 E:0.087953 |  gave a lot, gave everything they had, and it showed in their performance,
[5700.00 - 5704.00] P:1450.09 E:0.085518 |  and it quite rightly got talked about in a very positive way.
[5704.00 - 5708.00] P:1385.31 E:0.086624 |  But repeating that time and time again, or into this game,
[5708.00 - 5715.00] P:1306.13 E:0.087392 |  so soon after, may well have been a slight factor in the end game result.
[5715.00 - 5721.00] P:1578.39 E:0.093508 |  Well, they have a quarter of an hour to try and produce a remarkable comeback.
[5722.00 - 5727.00] P:1563.34 E:0.096128 |  And it will certainly mean for a very, very tight group going into the final set of matches
[5727.00 - 5730.00] P:1838.37 E:0.098224 |  for the other three sides, because Canada will be out,
[5730.00 - 5735.00] P:1730.76 E:0.086070 |  but we will have Morocco and Croatia on four points,
[5735.00 - 5742.00] P:1718.49 E:0.090809 |  and Belgium on three, and the final set of matches on the 1st of December,
[5742.00 - 5749.00] P:1600.70 E:0.080180 |  on Thursday, Croatia against Belgium, and Canada against Morocco.
[5750.00 - 5754.00] P:1574.21 E:0.092477 |  So you can certainly see why it was important for Croatia
[5754.00 - 5758.00] P:1602.42 E:0.083437 |  to get three points out of this game here today.
[5758.00 - 5761.00] P:1653.90 E:0.085143 |  Corners been taken short on the left-hand side.
[5761.00 - 5764.00] P:1602.35 E:0.085168 |  You're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live.
[5764.00 - 5767.00] P:1726.77 E:0.085321 |  We've got Spain, Germany coming up at 7 o'clock.
[5767.00 - 5771.00] P:1733.89 E:0.085575 |  After this game, we'll be switching to Kelly Cates in the stadium,
[5771.00 - 5775.00] P:1597.95 E:0.074963 |  who sat alongside John Murray and Peter Schmeichel.
[5775.00 - 5779.00] P:1565.40 E:0.085774 |  And that is also on BBC Television, so you can listen and watch
[5779.00 - 5783.00] P:1587.89 E:0.087348 |  through World Cup Extra on the iPlayer, as you can for this game
[5783.00 - 5785.00] P:1492.35 E:0.087680 |  and for the entirety of that one.
[5785.00 - 5788.00] P:1702.43 E:0.081180 |  Ipswich-Buckston is currently on Sports Extra.
[5788.00 - 5791.00] P:1762.65 E:0.087220 |  It's the FA Cup's second round. There's been a goal. Aaron Paul.
[5791.00 - 5792.00] P:1694.61 E:0.086752 |  Ipswich won.
[5792.00 - 5795.00] P:1688.58 E:0.110702 |  Buckston, they're a really good goal from the league one side,
[5795.00 - 5797.00] P:1839.84 E:0.096107 |  who have controlled things here.
[5797.00 - 5800.00] P:1806.40 E:0.095997 |  Ian Westburn's played a ball across the edge of the deep,
[5800.00 - 5804.00] P:1657.07 E:0.096228 |  and there was Conor Chaplin to place an effort into the bottom left-hand corner
[5804.00 - 5807.00] P:1709.00 E:0.078826 |  of the net. Ipswich won. Buckston now.
[5807.00 - 5811.00] P:1857.43 E:0.092567 |  And Derby County have beaten Newport County by two goals to one.
[5811.00 - 5815.00] P:1733.70 E:0.093214 |  They came from behind there in South Wales, as here is Hoylert,
[5815.00 - 5819.00] P:1754.16 E:0.089547 |  former Cardiff player, shoots from distance, right footed, tracks it wide.
[5819.00 - 5825.00] P:1580.60 E:0.076942 |  So Derby County joined Burton Albion, Borenwood,
[5825.00 - 5828.00] P:1727.00 E:0.089354 |  who knocked out Bristol Robers by two goals to now,
[5828.00 - 5832.00] P:1534.13 E:0.073168 |  and Fleetwood in the third round draw tomorrow night.
[5832.00 - 5838.00] P:1570.05 E:0.075999 |  You can watch that on BBC Two at 7 o'clock.
[5838.00 - 5842.00] P:1601.35 E:0.076293 |  But this is day eight of the World Cup,
[5842.00 - 5847.00] P:1632.90 E:0.087867 |  and Canada will be eliminated like the host's cat-up
[5847.00 - 5850.00] P:1567.98 E:0.073365 |  if it stays like this.
[5850.00 - 5853.00] P:1546.93 E:0.088247 |  They have scored their first-ever goal,
[5853.00 - 5857.00] P:1571.84 E:0.080539 |  but they are yet to pick up a point in this their fifth match
[5857.00 - 5860.00] P:1645.96 E:0.080076 |  at a men's World Cup tournament.
[5860.00 - 5865.00] P:1653.23 E:0.089763 |  El Salvador holds the record of the longest sequence without a win.
[5865.00 - 5869.00] P:1509.79 E:0.075183 |  That was six, so that might well be equaled
[5869.00 - 5873.00] P:1580.02 E:0.074998 |  if Canada don't get the victory against Morocco next Thursday,
[5873.00 - 5876.00] P:1790.20 E:0.086443 |  but with 13 minutes remaining,
[5876.00 - 5879.00] P:1639.27 E:0.073365 |  you don't get the sense that they look like
[5879.00 - 5882.00] P:1654.47 E:0.079147 |  getting their way back into this contest, Matt Upson.
[5882.00 - 5886.00] P:1544.72 E:0.081043 |  It would be a massive turn-up, really, if they were to get back in this game.
[5886.00 - 5891.00] P:1555.93 E:0.085799 |  It really has been Croatians almost all the way from the opening
[5891.00 - 5893.00] P:1601.28 E:0.087261 |  15 minutes of the game.
[5893.00 - 5896.00] P:1443.45 E:0.084270 |  They've just stamped their authority on this match,
[5896.00 - 5900.00] P:1667.49 E:0.084557 |  showed quality, showed control, energy at times.
[5900.00 - 5903.00] P:1501.52 E:0.086529 |  I'm looking at Kovacic now driving the ball forward
[5903.00 - 5906.00] P:1512.93 E:0.095637 |  from the middle of the park. He has been everywhere today.
[5906.00 - 5908.00] P:1571.29 E:0.098828 |  He has. He really has had a fine game.
[5908.00 - 5911.00] P:1775.84 E:0.099956 |  Perishic wants the game, doing the step-overs, almost goes to goal,
[5911.00 - 5915.00] P:1864.63 E:0.101420 |  comes out to Kovacic, and then Petkovic has the shot blocked
[5915.00 - 5917.00] P:1683.68 E:0.093334 |  by the goalkeeper Boyan.
[5918.00 - 5920.00] P:1794.86 E:0.101382 |  So close to a fourth goal.
[5920.00 - 5923.00] P:1722.08 E:0.087668 |  Should be four. I don't understand why Kovacic passed it, actually.
[5923.00 - 5925.00] P:1589.42 E:0.089633 |  Get it onto your right foot and hit it.
[5925.00 - 5927.00] P:1720.29 E:0.096241 |  It was really unselfish what he did.
[5927.00 - 5930.00] P:1859.59 E:0.101667 |  Now the counterattack, and it's played forward to Alfonso Davies.
[5930.00 - 5933.00] P:1804.95 E:0.092362 |  Keeps the ball in play, pulls it back, hoillets cross,
[5933.00 - 5935.00] P:1691.32 E:0.063997 |  headed out.
[5935.00 - 5937.00] P:1711.31 E:0.092847 |  Perishic looking towards Moderic.
[5937.00 - 5939.00] P:1830.81 E:0.086146 |  Canada try and get it back.
[5939.00 - 5944.00] P:1559.84 E:0.084964 |  The difference in quality in those situations we've just seen in the two,
[5944.00 - 5947.00] P:1609.72 E:0.096461 |  you can really tell, can't you? That final ball from Canada,
[5947.00 - 5950.00] P:1500.94 E:0.100455 |  that ability to get your head up and select the right pass.
[5950.00 - 5953.00] P:1460.45 E:0.092818 |  Croatia have done it every time they've been in positions.
[5953.00 - 5957.00] P:1548.70 E:0.095633 |  They've really executed their moves consistently throughout the game.
[5957.00 - 5960.00] P:1481.46 E:0.091877 |  Just haven't seen that same quality from Canada.
[5961.00 - 5967.00] P:1773.45 E:0.091971 |  44,374 inside a stadium that holds just under 46,000.
[5969.00 - 5972.00] P:1478.67 E:0.096338 |  Here in Doha, and a lot of them will be disappointed
[5972.00 - 5977.00] P:1755.68 E:0.087876 |  because there are what, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[5977.00 - 5981.00] P:1646.38 E:0.086511 |  banks in the lower reaches over on that far side
[5981.00 - 5985.00] P:1656.87 E:0.088350 |  in this expansive Khalifa stadium where the red shirts,
[5985.00 - 5987.00] P:1704.19 E:0.090701 |  the Canadian supporters are housed,
[5987.00 - 5991.00] P:1602.05 E:0.083692 |  and just think they were maybe thinking what could have been
[5991.00 - 5995.00] P:1713.14 E:0.082258 |  after they took the lead, after a goal, after just 67 seconds.
[5995.00 - 5998.00] P:1389.26 E:0.076068 |  But Croatia have hit back.
[5998.00 - 6002.00] P:1516.68 E:0.091566 |  It makes you wonder what the Croatian media might do now
[6002.00 - 6005.00] P:1562.05 E:0.089086 |  with the Maple Leafs and John Hirdman on the front pages
[6005.00 - 6007.00] P:1652.72 E:0.087162 |  of the Croatian papers in the morning.
[6007.00 - 6012.00] P:1394.54 E:0.083309 |  I'd moved on from that, don't take me back to that dark place,
[6012.00 - 6014.00] P:1419.58 E:0.084601 |  picturing things I don't want to.
[6016.00 - 6018.00] P:1727.41 E:0.102999 |  Perichic was the player who was getting treatment.
[6018.00 - 6021.00] P:1742.20 E:0.087121 |  He looks like he's all right to continue.
[6021.00 - 6024.00] P:1656.75 E:0.089156 |  He got the assist again for the third goal.
[6024.00 - 6028.00] P:1669.55 E:0.078864 |  So he's taken his tally now to seven assists
[6028.00 - 6033.00] P:1665.25 E:0.079645 |  to add to his nine goals for the most involvement
[6033.00 - 6038.00] P:1556.83 E:0.080720 |  for a Croatian player during tournament football.
[6038.00 - 6041.00] P:1726.14 E:0.092532 |  Certainly you look at his record.
[6041.00 - 6045.00] P:1813.12 E:0.089058 |  He actually only needs one goal to move level with Manzukic.
[6045.00 - 6049.00] P:1849.13 E:0.083250 |  But two goals he scored at 2014 in the World Cup.
[6049.00 - 6052.00] P:1774.23 E:0.090525 |  He followed up with another two goals at Euro 2016,
[6052.00 - 6054.00] P:1403.49 E:0.078299 |  three in Russia.
[6054.00 - 6057.00] P:1663.26 E:0.090181 |  He was certainly pivotal as Croatia beat England in the semi-final.
[6057.00 - 6060.00] P:1724.10 E:0.095066 |  I remember in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.
[6060.00 - 6063.00] P:1739.96 E:0.088094 |  And then another two goals at Euro 2020.
[6063.00 - 6067.00] P:1649.98 E:0.090713 |  So he has really been a key player down the years for Croatia.
[6067.00 - 6071.00] P:1666.03 E:0.093293 |  And it's proved to be tonight as they lead by three goals to one.
[6071.00 - 6073.00] P:1857.40 E:0.090886 |  Another goal in the FA Cup second round.
[6073.00 - 6075.00] P:1783.26 E:0.099181 |  Tired Portland Road, Aaron Paul.
[6075.00 - 6078.00] P:1504.67 E:0.100709 |  It's which two bucks, the nail cracking run from Cain Vincenjong.
[6078.00 - 6080.00] P:1771.96 E:0.100653 |  Down the left hand side is cross come shot.
[6080.00 - 6083.00] P:1755.67 E:0.091611 |  Fangasan Ahadme for his first in switch goal.
[6083.00 - 6086.00] P:1616.27 E:0.094185 |  And the tractor boys very much in control in this FA Cup tie.
[6086.00 - 6088.00] P:1621.11 E:0.079853 |  It's which two bucks the nail.
[6088.00 - 6090.00] P:1751.80 E:0.086997 |  Commentary of that is on Sports Extra.
[6090.00 - 6095.00] P:1525.97 E:0.082019 |  And a little later on tonight, a break from the World Cup, if you so wish.
[6095.00 - 6098.00] P:1794.20 E:0.085358 |  NFL coverage on Sports Extra at around nine o'clock.
[6098.00 - 6101.00] P:1620.28 E:0.077567 |  Arizona are at the LA Charges.
[6101.00 - 6103.00] P:1864.03 E:0.079840 |  Just think four years time.
[6103.00 - 6106.00] P:1491.47 E:0.080065 |  Could be in Los Angeles as well.
[6106.00 - 6109.00] P:1595.92 E:0.081449 |  Certainly the West Coast of America.
[6109.00 - 6114.00] P:1610.20 E:0.079034 |  Co-host with Canada and Mexico in 2026.
[6116.00 - 6119.00] P:1536.04 E:0.090356 |  A little bit more travelling than Qatar.
[6119.00 - 6120.00] P:1428.97 E:0.122872 |  Yeah.
[6120.00 - 6123.00] P:1480.66 E:0.095554 |  Slightly bigger area to cover.
[6123.00 - 6129.00] P:1733.44 E:0.093159 |  Yeah, bearing in mind that it's just the 46 miles between the eight stadiums here in Qatar.
[6129.00 - 6131.00] P:1685.11 E:0.080005 |  At the maximum travelling distance.
[6131.00 - 6134.00] P:1763.37 E:0.093119 |  Great vocal support from the Croatian fans.
[6134.00 - 6137.00] P:1637.97 E:0.078971 |  They've certainly put in plenty of travel.
[6137.00 - 6146.00] P:1506.19 E:0.086526 |  Whether it be Rayeka, Zagreb, Osiak, wherever they've come from that lovely country in Croatia.
[6146.00 - 6148.00] P:1294.93 E:0.093121 |  Very, very vocal.
[6148.00 - 6150.00] P:1628.00 E:0.097638 |  Away towards our left hand side.
[6150.00 - 6153.00] P:1556.70 E:0.094623 |  And their side are leading by three goals to one.
[6153.00 - 6154.00] P:1960.39 E:0.087131 |  Perishic shoots.
[6154.00 - 6156.00] P:1616.42 E:0.089830 |  Left footed, dragged it wide.
[6156.00 - 6158.00] P:1704.71 E:0.084859 |  Left footed edge of the area out for a goal kick.
[6158.00 - 6162.00] P:1695.88 E:0.077803 |  Eight minutes of normal time remaining.
[6164.00 - 6169.00] P:1903.95 E:0.092434 |  Certainly though, it's going to be a very exciting final set of matches next Thursday.
[6169.00 - 6171.00] P:1819.62 E:0.087317 |  It really is, isn't it?
[6171.00 - 6175.00] P:1784.47 E:0.081206 |  I mean, that Belgium-Croatia, it's going to be fascinating.
[6175.00 - 6176.00] P:1632.75 E:0.085881 |  It really is.
[6176.00 - 6185.00] P:1484.16 E:0.084972 |  I mean, Croatia taking this performance and result into that game to a Belgium team that's a little bit on the floor at the moment, I'd say,
[6185.00 - 6188.00] P:1408.17 E:0.079991 |  in terms of confidence and how they're feeling.
[6188.00 - 6191.00] P:1491.20 E:0.073628 |  Could really be an interesting match.
[6191.00 - 6193.00] P:1652.43 E:0.095096 |  Well, I'll tell you who else was on the floor.
[6193.00 - 6195.00] P:1618.48 E:0.084724 |  It was inside this stadium not that long ago.
[6195.00 - 6199.00] P:1666.37 E:0.077660 |  Germany, how will they respond against Spain?
[6199.00 - 6204.00] P:1688.29 E:0.084520 |  Because at the minute, you've got Japan on three points and Costa Rica on three points.
[6204.00 - 6208.00] P:1584.78 E:0.068521 |  After Costa Rica beat Japan by a goal to Nell earlier.
[6208.00 - 6214.00] P:1612.67 E:0.084782 |  Spain can qualify if they can beat Germany, but that would really put Germany up against it.
[6214.00 - 6215.00] P:1858.98 E:0.083792 |  It's a vital game.
[6215.00 - 6220.00] P:1755.87 E:0.087541 |  Peter Schmeichel and John Murray will be providing commentary alongside Kelly Cates.
[6220.00 - 6227.00] P:1679.31 E:0.082304 |  All the build-up to come from 7 o'clock and earlier, Belgium, Nell Morocco 2, was the scoreline in this group,
[6227.00 - 6233.00] P:1680.31 E:0.084737 |  which means that that's why it's going to be so tight going into those final matches next Thursday.
[6234.00 - 6244.00] P:1660.12 E:0.084527 |  Comprehensive coverage of the World Cup on five live, whether it be with Rick Edwinson, Rachel Burden at breakfast from six,
[6245.00 - 6252.00] P:1666.54 E:0.086768 |  or then with all the games live on the station and also through BBC Sounds.
[6252.00 - 6256.00] P:1818.87 E:0.089116 |  Hoylett out towards the far side, asking far too much of Asauria.
[6256.00 - 6258.00] P:1783.03 E:0.094507 |  I don't think the changes have helped Canada at all.
[6258.00 - 6260.00] P:1855.27 E:0.096584 |  It becomes too disjointed.
[6260.00 - 6263.00] P:1696.57 E:0.087442 |  Yeah, they're not too sure about the movements, the patterns,
[6263.00 - 6266.00] P:1432.37 E:0.082144 |  which I think they had nailed down in the first game.
[6266.00 - 6272.00] P:1491.82 E:0.084077 |  But I've been interestingly watching this little duel between Alfonso Davies and Gavaglio,
[6272.00 - 6274.00] P:1583.79 E:0.076997 |  who sent them back for Croatia.
[6274.00 - 6277.00] P:1684.06 E:0.097000 |  It's been really interesting seeing them two joust against each other.
[6277.00 - 6278.00] P:1832.99 E:0.103360 |  The change of direction.
[6278.00 - 6282.00] P:1765.02 E:0.096799 |  Davies keeps dropping short with the ball, spinning, trying to get turned,
[6282.00 - 6285.00] P:1564.10 E:0.092683 |  wants to face him up and beat him 1v1.
[6285.00 - 6289.00] P:1676.77 E:0.085328 |  Gavaglio showing really good mobility to try and deal with him.
[6289.00 - 6291.00] P:1500.34 E:0.052574 |  It's a good match-up.
[6291.00 - 6298.00] P:1805.57 E:0.090229 |  There's just been a yellow card shown to Modric and Camel Miller, the defender for Canada.
[6298.00 - 6306.00] P:1686.55 E:0.079232 |  The Uruguayan referee, certainly Miller seemed to take exception to something from Modric.
[6306.00 - 6311.00] P:1873.10 E:0.082135 |  There was quite a forceful push in the chest by Miller on Modric.
[6311.00 - 6315.00] P:1772.85 E:0.088123 |  But the referee has shown a yellow card to both players.
[6315.00 - 6326.00] P:1833.08 E:0.080922 |  As Croatia you sense, feel that the game is won because Dalic is going to make a triple change in these closing stages.
[6326.00 - 6330.00] P:1709.44 E:0.079507 |  Canada have the ball on this near side the right.
[6330.00 - 6333.00] P:1699.95 E:0.054229 |  Alfonso Davies waits.
[6333.00 - 6336.00] P:1722.75 E:0.068824 |  Back it goes then to Johnston.
[6336.00 - 6343.00] P:1770.13 E:0.082470 |  Johnston cross strikes the back of Perichic, kept in play by Johnston once again.
[6343.00 - 6346.00] P:1440.81 E:0.083151 |  And now it's with Vittoria.
[6346.00 - 6354.00] P:1685.63 E:0.083784 |  Every outfield player is in the Croatian half, but it's quite a high line from that Canadian at the Croatian backline.
[6354.00 - 6358.00] P:1814.07 E:0.085734 |  And now the changes will be made, which means we can get the team-years.
[6358.00 - 6362.00] P:1809.68 E:0.088587 |  From Spain to Germany, it's coming up on BBC Radio 5 Live at 7.
[6362.00 - 6365.00] P:1588.96 E:0.074999 |  And it'll be in the company of John Murray.
[6365.00 - 6368.00] P:1837.29 E:0.093830 |  Well, this is the group that's thrown up some surprises.
[6368.00 - 6373.00] P:1874.25 E:0.094987 |  Luis Enrique, for this one, suggested he would make changes after their 7-0 win in their opening match.
[6373.00 - 6378.00] P:1842.60 E:0.087992 |  But there's just the one, and that is Carvajal coming in for Aspelikweta at right back.
[6378.00 - 6383.00] P:1903.25 E:0.083217 |  Hansi Flick makes two changes as Germany look to get off the mark.
[6383.00 - 6388.00] P:1760.36 E:0.076566 |  And Schlauferts and Schlauferts make way for Guretska and Kera.
[6388.00 - 6389.00] P:1692.93 E:0.095203 |  Thank you, John.
[6389.00 - 6394.00] P:1677.01 E:0.089592 |  John joined by Piotr Schmeichel, Kali Keit presenting from the stadium.
[6394.00 - 6396.00] P:1778.11 E:0.071318 |  Modric has come off.
[6396.00 - 6398.00] P:1887.83 E:0.103532 |  Kovacic has been outstanding as come off.
[6398.00 - 6401.00] P:1807.15 E:0.075084 |  Perichic has also come off.
[6401.00 - 6409.00] P:1719.25 E:0.091601 |  And so the players who have come on, Maja for Kovacic, Orsic for Perichic,
[6409.00 - 6413.00] P:1693.00 E:0.096059 |  Pashalic has also come on to the field of play.
[6413.00 - 6418.00] P:1567.71 E:0.086027 |  So the triple change being made by Dalic.
[6418.00 - 6424.00] P:1880.46 E:0.098946 |  So Orsic, who scored the winning goal against Chelsea in the Champions League in the Maximus Stadium,
[6424.00 - 6430.00] P:1751.13 E:0.077158 |  hasn't necessarily replicated his club form on the international stage.
[6430.00 - 6432.00] P:1747.58 E:0.089658 |  So he is on.
[6432.00 - 6435.00] P:1676.41 E:0.078684 |  And we have about three and a half minutes remaining.
[6435.00 - 6437.00] P:1842.40 E:0.074194 |  But Kovacic, outstanding.
[6437.00 - 6438.00] P:1783.72 E:0.088140 |  Absolutely.
[6438.00 - 6442.00] P:1733.60 E:0.097158 |  I really think that he was so important in that early stage of the game.
[6442.00 - 6443.00] P:1488.54 E:0.076405 |  And they went one nil down.
[6443.00 - 6445.00] P:1429.67 E:0.088248 |  And it was a little bit open.
[6445.00 - 6447.00] P:1523.61 E:0.074788 |  The distances were too big.
[6447.00 - 6449.00] P:1473.55 E:0.094464 |  The midfield was a little bit vulnerable.
[6449.00 - 6454.00] P:1534.59 E:0.097730 |  But he's the one in there that's got the legs and the engine and the running power to deal with it.
[6454.00 - 6457.00] P:1792.74 E:0.107309 |  Ball was played through the middle towards Cavalini.
[6457.00 - 6463.00] P:1707.00 E:0.092305 |  Didn't really have the pace on it to try and find its way through to him in that inside left channel.
[6463.00 - 6466.00] P:1688.27 E:0.086379 |  Canada look very, very tired now.
[6466.00 - 6470.00] P:1664.99 E:0.072431 |  I mean, John Hirdman has done an exceptional job.
[6470.00 - 6476.00] P:1782.76 E:0.086811 |  He's taken them from 94th in the world when he took over to, they are now ranked 41st.
[6476.00 - 6478.00] P:1694.95 E:0.084104 |  They did ever so well in qualifying.
[6478.00 - 6480.00] P:1813.75 E:0.080521 |  They finished ahead of the United States.
[6480.00 - 6482.00] P:1749.96 E:0.088102 |  They finished ahead of Mexico in qualifying.
[6482.00 - 6486.00] P:1824.96 E:0.082851 |  They certainly created some iconic moments along the way.
[6486.00 - 6490.00] P:1862.92 E:0.083023 |  But they've fallen short in what has been a tough group.
[6490.00 - 6497.00] P:1568.12 E:0.077910 |  I mean, you can't underestimate what that nervous tension and energy brings, especially in that first game.
[6497.00 - 6498.00] P:1397.35 E:0.092231 |  I mean, look at the build-up.
[6498.00 - 6502.00] P:1533.51 E:0.086912 |  You've got a coach who's a key motivator, the way he manages.
[6502.00 - 6506.00] P:1626.89 E:0.085360 |  You've got an inspirational figure in the dressing room from your home country,
[6506.00 - 6509.00] P:1619.81 E:0.092825 |  who's the first person that's been on the moon.
[6509.00 - 6513.00] P:1611.58 E:0.083706 |  I'm sure you've got a massive lift out of them, which you saw in their performance.
[6513.00 - 6517.00] P:1516.28 E:0.078822 |  And it's like the replica in that is very difficult.
[6517.00 - 6519.00] P:1679.56 E:0.096042 |  And it's just been a little bit calmer this game, hasn't it?
[6519.00 - 6525.00] P:1541.00 E:0.087276 |  And from such a great start as well, brilliant opening in a few minutes or 10 minutes from Canada.
[6525.00 - 6529.00] P:1568.45 E:0.081683 |  And it's just slowly just kind of fallen away from them.
[6529.00 - 6533.00] P:1829.67 E:0.080305 |  Well, they created the chances against Belgium, but didn't have the quality.
[6533.00 - 6541.00] P:1701.38 E:0.074343 |  Tonight, they struggled to create clear openings after taking the lead after just 67 seconds.
[6541.00 - 6545.00] P:1784.57 E:0.084586 |  I mean, in the second half, they had those two from Osorio,
[6545.00 - 6549.00] P:1759.35 E:0.081381 |  and then the one from David was tipped over by Leverkovich.
[6549.00 - 6552.00] P:1689.61 E:0.097558 |  Can't really recall too much other than that.
[6552.00 - 6555.00] P:1579.94 E:0.092247 |  But they weren't real clear-cut goalscoring chances.
[6555.00 - 6557.00] P:1280.38 E:0.073541 |  They were half-chances, really, weren't they?
[6557.00 - 6563.00] P:1537.93 E:0.078599 |  But Croatia have shown their quality, particularly with Kramaric.
[6567.00 - 6573.00] P:1579.85 E:0.083795 |  And leading 3-1 with 60 seconds remaining.
[6573.00 - 6578.00] P:1737.84 E:0.076320 |  How much added on time is always of an interest in this world cup.
[6578.00 - 6582.00] P:1690.28 E:0.068794 |  Proved to be somewhat of a lottery predicting.
[6582.00 - 6589.00] P:1579.26 E:0.075364 |  And we're told there'll be six minutes from Gary Flint of our producer here,
[6589.00 - 6592.00] P:1620.40 E:0.084542 |  who's looked into his crystal ball.
[6592.00 - 6598.00] P:1631.31 E:0.080528 |  As we're yet to see the fourth official who hovers down below.
[6598.00 - 6602.00] P:1669.56 E:0.088537 |  But here is Petkovich, enters the penalty area,
[6602.00 - 6606.00] P:1699.70 E:0.081956 |  shot placed in from the substitute, Orsic,
[6606.00 - 6611.00] P:1684.96 E:0.079113 |  but it was a right-footed effort that was comfortably saved by Boyan.
[6611.00 - 6614.00] P:1454.94 E:0.093445 |  I mean, there's been so many attacks like that in this game,
[6614.00 - 6617.00] P:1404.36 E:0.093835 |  where Croatia have won the ball in and around the middle of the pitch,
[6617.00 - 6619.00] P:1424.29 E:0.085580 |  or even on the edge of their own box,
[6619.00 - 6622.00] P:1579.15 E:0.079226 |  and the way they've broken forwards, the link-up play,
[6622.00 - 6625.00] P:1469.77 E:0.086257 |  the first touch of the centre forward, or the player wide at the front three,
[6625.00 - 6628.00] P:1571.32 E:0.088274 |  they've just been so intelligent with the way they've laid the ball off,
[6628.00 - 6631.00] P:1491.00 E:0.086780 |  then popped the ball into space for an ongoing runner,
[6631.00 - 6634.00] P:1546.76 E:0.094616 |  whether that be a fallback or another midfield player.
[6634.00 - 6636.00] P:1376.14 E:0.081350 |  They've really have linked up well,
[6636.00 - 6641.00] P:1277.19 E:0.078896 |  it's been really well organised attack in play today from Croatia.
[6641.00 - 6645.00] P:1690.61 E:0.083475 |  Fourth official, then she's forward, and there it is.
[6645.00 - 6649.00] P:1659.82 E:0.089213 |  The bright red digit on the electronic board of six is shown
[6649.00 - 6653.00] P:1673.92 E:0.085282 |  to all sides of the Khalifa International Stadium,
[6653.00 - 6656.00] P:1624.41 E:0.083904 |  as Canada with Alfonso Davies.
[6657.00 - 6661.00] P:1728.77 E:0.094136 |  As he goes to the right-hand side to Alistair Johnson, puts in the cross,
[6661.00 - 6663.00] P:1788.65 E:0.097249 |  headed away by Lovren.
[6665.00 - 6671.00] P:1743.31 E:0.085682 |  They've had players in all departments who have excelled tonight, Croatia.
[6671.00 - 6677.00] P:1673.34 E:0.080967 |  Kavadiol at the back, Modric and Kovacic in the centre of midfield,
[6677.00 - 6678.00] P:1620.38 E:0.072870 |  and Kramaric up front.
[6678.00 - 6679.00] P:1189.01 E:0.089768 |  Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[6679.00 - 6682.00] P:1292.43 E:0.089556 |  I think you can pick those out and say they've been excellent.
[6682.00 - 6685.00] P:1303.56 E:0.077240 |  They're the players that have really driven this game,
[6685.00 - 6689.00] P:1467.27 E:0.080309 |  and the other players in the team, their levels have been good too.
[6689.00 - 6693.00] P:1711.63 E:0.083738 |  So it's been just an overall, from that first opening 10, 15 minutes,
[6693.00 - 6697.00] P:1521.63 E:0.071497 |  where they're not too good, they've really stepped up,
[6697.00 - 6701.00] P:1499.37 E:0.085763 |  and it's been a very well accomplished performance, shall we say,
[6701.00 - 6705.00] P:1636.97 E:0.087687 |  with some very good experienced players in the team.
[6706.00 - 6709.00] P:1946.79 E:0.107688 |  Cubiland Croatian supporters away towards our left-hand side.
[6709.00 - 6712.00] P:1891.44 E:0.102796 |  They're leading by three goals to one, we're in stoppage time.
[6713.00 - 6717.00] P:1785.06 E:0.090430 |  Spain against Germany is coming up, another key game.
[6719.00 - 6727.00] P:1512.62 E:0.069231 |  And Germany will be looking to bounce back after suffering back-to-back defeats
[6727.00 - 6731.00] P:1742.38 E:0.088208 |  in the World Cup for the first time since the end of the 78 World Cup,
[6731.00 - 6733.00] P:1630.05 E:0.077506 |  and then the start of 82.
[6735.00 - 6738.00] P:1725.50 E:0.101812 |  So they're going to have to draw on their years of tournament experience
[6738.00 - 6744.00] P:1848.06 E:0.083526 |  against Spain, who looked so impressive against Costa Rica the other night.
[6744.00 - 6747.00] P:1596.91 E:0.072502 |  And on this evidence for Croatia, you would fear for Belgium.
[6747.00 - 6751.00] P:1426.65 E:0.083013 |  They were back to that kind of Spain of nobody else can touch the ball,
[6751.00 - 6757.00] P:1565.07 E:0.082148 |  weren't they? The way they kept possession and how controlled they were was brilliant to watch.
[6757.00 - 6760.00] P:1769.34 E:0.085313 |  We have four minutes remaining of stoppage time.
[6760.00 - 6764.00] P:1894.33 E:0.094565 |  Alfonso Davies swings over the cross, headed away by Joranovic,
[6764.00 - 6767.00] P:1683.50 E:0.089504 |  fired back in by Hoilet, cleared by Croatia.
[6768.00 - 6773.00] P:1761.28 E:0.083286 |  Hoilet picks up that loose ball, in goes his ball, Guardiola again.
[6773.00 - 6777.00] P:1887.23 E:0.104124 |  He has been immense. Hoilet again with a dipping effort on the edge of the area right foot,
[6777.00 - 6783.00] P:1851.73 E:0.088581 |  he drops wide of the left-hand post, and out it goes for a goal kick, still 3-1 Croatian.
[6783.00 - 6787.00] P:1713.16 E:0.088806 |  Yeah, a bit of a flurry at the Croatian goal, all from outside the box.
[6787.00 - 6791.00] P:1611.95 E:0.088565 |  Junio Hoilet with the final one, right-footed volley that just kind of sat up,
[6791.00 - 6795.00] P:1494.11 E:0.073257 |  didn't hit it with any real conviction.
[6795.00 - 6798.00] P:1500.58 E:0.103055 |  But you're right, Deno, it's that man Guardiola again, wasn't it,
[6798.00 - 6804.00] P:1566.31 E:0.081743 |  with the stooping header, just to clear the Croatian box, and he has been immense today.
[6804.00 - 6807.00] P:1675.32 E:0.080070 |  Half-time in the FA Cup, second round.
[6807.00 - 6814.00] P:1708.46 E:0.079245 |  Ipswich Town are leading Buxton by two goals to nil, the second half will be on Sports Extra.
[6814.00 - 6821.00] P:1736.17 E:0.080546 |  Tomorrow's four games, and the coverage starts at 9 in the morning after five live breakfast with Rick and Rachel.
[6821.00 - 6828.00] P:1651.56 E:0.078995 |  Cameroon Serbia in Group G from 10, and it's Group H, South Korea Garner at one o'clock.
[6828.00 - 6835.00] P:1770.24 E:0.080423 |  The break-off is the cross from the left-hand side, Buchanan, Cavadial once more sweeps it to safety.
[6835.00 - 6840.00] P:1774.57 E:0.088969 |  Brazil, Switzerland at four, both sides of course won their opening game in Group G.
[6840.00 - 6843.00] P:1942.53 E:0.098089 |  Oh, as Croatia are away.
[6843.00 - 6850.00] P:1835.98 E:0.093009 |  Croatia on the counterattack, and it's unselfishly paid out towards the far side.
[6850.00 - 6863.00] P:1853.29 E:0.094740 |  Brilliant play by Orsic, and he just teed up Maier, who had the easiest of tasks to get a fourth goal in stoppage time.
[6863.00 - 6873.00] P:1800.85 E:0.099872 |  Croatia have led their football to the talking, and they have beaten Canada by four goals to one.
[6873.00 - 6879.00] P:1568.10 E:0.101405 |  Well, I'm not too sure what Miller's thinking, whether it's fatigue or tiredness, he comes across.
[6879.00 - 6882.00] P:1496.64 E:0.101191 |  The ball bounces in front of him, he doesn't deal with it.
[6882.00 - 6889.00] P:1463.16 E:0.097765 |  I think he tries to bring it under control as it bounces into him, but really makes a poor error, it goes through his legs,
[6889.00 - 6894.00] P:1608.83 E:0.091747 |  and then it's literally two Croatian players bearing down on goal.
[6894.00 - 6897.00] P:1643.44 E:0.097930 |  And like you said, really unselfish.
[6897.00 - 6902.00] P:1575.91 E:0.100877 |  I mean, the only thing Maier has to do is just make sure he stays onside, doesn't get ahead of the player.
[6902.00 - 6908.00] P:1519.06 E:0.079616 |  He does that well, and then just strokes the ball left-footed into the roof of the net.
[6908.00 - 6910.00] P:1709.34 E:0.095226 |  He'll have to eat his words.
[6910.00 - 6920.00] P:1854.89 E:0.091878 |  I would imagine that will be the message from Zlatko Dalic and the Croatian players across his court by Livokovic.
[6920.00 - 6923.00] P:1726.86 E:0.080414 |  They're classes told from Croatia.
[6923.00 - 6927.00] P:1542.19 E:0.089915 |  Yeah, certainly. Certainly has. There's no doubt in that.
[6927.00 - 6931.00] P:1664.25 E:0.092642 |  All goals, OK, that one's a mistake, but they've had other opportunities.
[6931.00 - 6935.00] P:1665.87 E:0.093517 |  The score line isn't harsh on Canada, really.
[6935.00 - 6939.00] P:1638.57 E:0.086174 |  It's probably just about right of the dominance of Croatia in this game.
[6939.00 - 6947.00] P:1737.90 E:0.080776 |  Lovre and Maier with his fourth goal for himself, scoring the fourth goal for Croatia on the night.
[6947.00 - 6956.00] P:1726.38 E:0.089834 |  They've seen that the 24-year-old Ren midfielder could be a long-term successor to Moderic, which is some boots to fill.
[6956.00 - 6962.00] P:1712.47 E:0.084298 |  But they've certainly filled their boots tonight with four goals, that is for sure in stoppage time.
[6962.00 - 6969.00] P:1679.70 E:0.082153 |  Croatia four, Canada one, and a rather dispirited Canadian team now just playing out the last couple of minutes.
[6969.00 - 6975.00] P:1430.36 E:0.086485 |  I mean, you did ask the question in the build-up of whether or not what he has said there is going to backfire.
[6975.00 - 6977.00] P:1450.36 E:0.060971 |  Yeah, it was...
[6977.00 - 6979.00] P:1538.43 E:0.075698 |  We had a couple of good questions, actually.
[6979.00 - 6985.00] P:1649.65 E:0.086365 |  I know what he was trying to do, but inadvertently, he poked the bear.
[6985.00 - 6986.00] P:1612.32 E:0.088816 |  They did.
[6986.00 - 6991.00] P:1676.37 E:0.089426 |  And they were irked, they were riled, and they've, as I say, they've let their football do in the talk.
[6991.00 - 6993.00] P:1768.06 E:0.095486 |  Another ball's just been given away.
[6993.00 - 7000.00] P:1793.41 E:0.099860 |  Croatia are looking for more goals here, and once again, it's all slid forward as Peckovic just couldn't get on the end of it behind.
[7000.00 - 7002.00] P:1610.78 E:0.061633 |  It goes for a corner kick.
[7002.00 - 7004.00] P:1697.17 E:0.105932 |  I mean, they're just hanging on now.
[7004.00 - 7009.00] P:1772.25 E:0.091912 |  Canada, they're sloppy mistakes over the pitch, and that is them done, I think.
[7009.00 - 7015.00] P:1779.26 E:0.098068 |  The Canadian players drop to their knees, and they're dropping out of the World Cup in Qatar.
[7015.00 - 7025.00] P:1763.93 E:0.094784 |  As Croatia go level at the top of Group F, four points apiece after a 4-1 win, and a quality performance from Croatia,
[7025.00 - 7030.00] P:1706.41 E:0.094803 |  bearing in mind that Canada, with their first ever goal in a men's World Cup,
[7030.00 - 7034.00] P:1780.94 E:0.100876 |  had taken the lead after just 67 seconds ahead of from Alfonso Davies.
[7034.00 - 7038.00] P:1649.63 E:0.091164 |  But after that, Croatia just were very, very good.
[7038.00 - 7044.00] P:1714.15 E:0.092802 |  Two goals from Grameric, Lvivaja, and then a goal in stoppage time from Maja, and they could have had more.
[7044.00 - 7051.00] P:1640.29 E:0.091864 |  Yeah, I mean, after a blistering start from Canada, couldn't have started better in many ways,
[7051.00 - 7054.00] P:1521.14 E:0.090502 |  but it was then Croatia that just went through the gears.
[7054.00 - 7059.00] P:1588.07 E:0.091771 |  Really good football, very controlled, very composed, measured play,
[7059.00 - 7064.00] P:1597.50 E:0.099519 |  and they were brutal at times with the way they kept the ball and the way they counter-attacked
[7064.00 - 7067.00] P:1721.49 E:0.099826 |  and tried to get overloads and worked the ball into situations.
[7067.00 - 7072.00] P:1649.18 E:0.092798 |  And with the players they have, they showed real finishing quality,
[7072.00 - 7075.00] P:1604.40 E:0.095200 |  and they'll be more than happy with the performance in this game today.
[7075.00 - 7080.00] P:1833.63 E:0.097276 |  And those who weren't on the score sheet, a special mention to Kovacic in the midfield,
[7080.00 - 7085.00] P:1511.05 E:0.094374 |  who was outstanding and Kvadiol, who was great at the back, certainly caught the eye.
[7085.00 - 7090.00] P:1703.99 E:0.088080 |  But it's finished here in the Khalifa International Stadium.
[7090.00 - 7096.00] P:1593.33 E:0.084509 |  Croatia 4, Canada 1, and now we cross to Kelly Cates,
[7096.00 - 7101.00] P:1554.74 E:0.083087 |  who'll be licking her lips in anticipation of Spain, Germany.
