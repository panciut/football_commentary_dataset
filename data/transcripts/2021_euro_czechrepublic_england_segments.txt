[0.00 - 7.40] P:1829.82 E:0.338266 |  Thank you Mark, well England's first week of Euro 2020 progressed from expectation to frustration and isolation.
[7.40 - 11.08] P:1795.22 E:0.344376 |  At the end of the second week of knowing they've been successfully navigated.
[11.08 - 18.12] P:1758.73 E:0.354049 |  The three Lions are sure to be one of the eight, not to be one of the eight teams to face the earliest of exits.
[18.12 - 27.28] P:1813.12 E:0.343443 |  And Arsenal still remains element of doubt as to who's, when's and where's from this point on all become abundantly clear over the next 24 hours.
[27.28 - 32.80] P:1894.87 E:0.324831 |  With England having made it through to 90s and 90s when all eyes are on the performance rather than the result.
[32.80 - 37.56] P:1857.63 E:0.299865 |  The ability to be on the front foot, to create chances, to set down a marker.
[37.56 - 43.64] P:1810.40 E:0.312740 |  A combination of forwards that haven't started together before, including the people's choice Jack Reelish.
[43.64 - 48.16] P:1772.18 E:0.306942 |  England hoping for the right formula rather than a formulaic display.
[48.16 - 54.60] P:1768.62 E:0.302166 |  It is, pick for the goal, walker at right back, stones alongside the returning McGuire and Shaw on the left.
[54.68 - 58.84] P:1794.84 E:0.321055 |  A back four that has played together once before in Albania in March.
[58.84 - 65.04] P:1922.98 E:0.310695 |  Wrightson, Phillips in midfield, Saker and Sterling White as the Arsenal teenager makes his tournament debut.
[65.04 - 70.52] P:1846.24 E:0.300786 |  And Kane up front who's scored in all three of his previous games against the Czechs.
[70.52 - 74.88] P:1895.45 E:0.294988 |  Right now the Czechs stop the group, victory in Scotland, a point against Croatia.
[74.88 - 80.24] P:1846.84 E:0.304144 |  A slender goal difference advantage means they only need a draw tonight to win the section.
[80.24 - 83.88] P:1680.90 E:0.319025 |  England have their number on their last visit here in 2019.
[84.00 - 87.16] P:1750.94 E:0.303555 |  Raheem Sterling-Tandrick underpinning a 5-0 victory.
[87.16 - 93.04] P:1845.66 E:0.298039 |  The revenge was served later that year and tonight the Czechs have named nine of the side that beat the three Lions in Prague.
[93.04 - 99.28] P:1814.41 E:0.301014 |  They have advanced leaking goal, Sophal of West Ham, Cieluska, Kallas of Bristol City in Borzil,
[99.28 - 108.24] P:1690.73 E:0.282793 |  Hollash and another hammer, Tomas Oceke in midfield and Mazapuz, Derrida and Janktoch in support of Schick up front.
[109.24 - 113.36] P:1865.60 E:0.289222 |  England in all white tonight, the Czechs in red shirts.
[113.48 - 120.64] P:1839.78 E:0.310332 |  And before kickoff England players take the knee, reiterating the message that there is no room for racism.
[122.44 - 127.28] P:1956.47 E:0.308193 |  Well against Scotland England were able to take a point, now against the Czechs they have to make one.
[127.28 - 136.48] P:1752.32 E:0.296088 |  A place in the last 16s already guaranteed, but the next 90 minutes once you set the itinerary for the rest of the tournament it could well set the mood too.
[136.60 - 143.24] P:1594.49 E:0.278082 |  And England defending the end away to our right hand side trying to get forward on the front foot from the very off.
[143.24 - 150.20] P:1652.39 E:0.315120 |  The Czechs turning it forward and will be chased by Jankto down the left hand side of the penalty area but easily not it back for Pickford.
[150.20 - 163.32] P:1601.05 E:0.300179 |  And it's a long throw from him taken down by Luxor on the England left, can't find Harry Kane and it fall by Declan Rice and then very quickly away through the back line from Cieluska.
[163.72 - 166.76] P:1430.17 E:0.324547 |  And England in a position to mop up at the back.
[166.76 - 175.52] P:1564.66 E:0.333755 |  And the man alongside me is Stuart Pierce. Interesting how England have just aligned the front foot in the early stages.
[175.52 - 189.36] P:1422.74 E:0.349151 |  Yeah it is. Well they started off with Sterling on the left hand side, Grealish is a number 10 and Sackle on the right hand side but I don't know whether it's just where they've ended up but Sterling's just gone into that number 10 role.
[189.40 - 193.56] P:1391.69 E:0.347999 |  And I think they'll play fairly narrow whichever it is potentially.
[195.56 - 208.40] P:1583.00 E:0.327831 |  Sackle starting on the right hand side he had an outstanding game for Arsenal against Slavia Prague back in April where he was up against Jan Bozil who is up against again tonight playing at left back.
[208.44 - 221.44] P:1476.82 E:0.311249 |  Sackle so superior in that particular battle when they met that Bozil was taken off at half time Sackle had taken him on and beaten him five times in that first 45 minutes and scored an excellent goal as well.
[221.44 - 225.24] P:1614.87 E:0.353540 |  That may well be instrumental in his selection tonight.
[225.24 - 233.24] P:1720.80 E:0.332894 |  Now Kane has dropped deeper to pick up the ball but used it to good effect, trying to find Grealish, wins the seconds, sure for for Sterling.
[233.24 - 236.44] P:1835.17 E:0.293078 |  Sterling lobs it over the goalkeeper and he's hit the post.
[236.48 - 242.48] P:1739.53 E:0.305509 |  And for the third successive game England have hit the frame of the goal inside the opening 10 minutes.
[242.48 - 247.48] P:1683.03 E:0.312431 |  On that occasion an excellent ball for great movement in behind from Raheem Sterling.
[247.48 - 252.48] P:1712.62 E:0.308242 |  That's something you haven't seen enough of in the tournament so far, brilliantly found by Shaw.
[252.48 - 259.48] P:1661.27 E:0.284449 |  Goalkeeper stuck in no man's land Sterling lobed it over him but it bounced with topspin and flicked onto the post.
[259.52 - 271.52] P:1425.18 E:0.317291 |  Yeah goalkeeper and swept it up he panicked, he sat back Sterling got there first and it's that type of ball and that type of run that calls Scotland the odd problem at times.
[271.52 - 280.52] P:1398.43 E:0.321379 |  And I think we've got the ability to turn teams round and get him behind if we possibly can Sterling certainly got the pace to be a problem and a threat.
[280.52 - 288.52] P:1672.30 E:0.301359 |  Well it was Foden in the game against Croatia, John Stones against the Scots and now Raheem Sterling hitting the post very early on.
[288.56 - 296.56] P:1652.07 E:0.296979 |  In the game against the Czech Republic. As far as the maths concerns tonight I'm sure you're aware England must win to win the group.
[296.56 - 306.56] P:1649.46 E:0.288280 |  They'll be runners up with a draw they could conceivably finish third in the group if they lost in Scotland 1 it would take at least a three goal swing.
[306.56 - 313.56] P:1562.14 E:0.269852 |  And in the other game which is live for you right now over on Talksport 2 if Scotland against Croatia is a draw they're both out.
[313.60 - 321.60] P:1470.51 E:0.258665 |  If it's not a draw then the winners go through and the losers and Finland will be eliminated.
[321.60 - 329.60] P:1404.89 E:0.289466 |  We'll keep you up to date throughout the course of the night of course and the conclusion of group D here on Talksport and Talksport 2.
[329.60 - 337.60] P:1557.69 E:0.343031 |  Here on Talksport a very bright England start and the opening three and a half minutes Jim Brownfoot, Sol Campbell, Sturepius, talk you through the action.
[337.64 - 345.64] P:1674.89 E:0.326657 |  Grealish with the ball running at the Czech back line and Lutschall drives it in it hits, Mazapas and goes out of play for an England throw.
[345.64 - 353.64] P:1579.50 E:0.305511 |  But already more signs of attacking intent, more signs of England being on the front foot and being able to take the game to the Czechs.
[353.64 - 363.64] P:1595.61 E:0.349842 |  Also as well flexibility of movement Grealish and Sterling not to be seen in one area all the time straight away from the offset.
[363.68 - 371.68] P:1571.94 E:0.326947 |  Grealish has been central he's been left Sterling the same as well they've got flexibility to interchange and that will cause the Czechs a problem.
[371.68 - 377.68] P:1440.10 E:0.319506 |  Declan Rice being put under pressure by Thomas Socek to a man that know each other so well.
[377.68 - 385.68] P:1397.51 E:0.351257 |  Rice hardly missed the game this season in the West Ham United midfield and Socek didn't miss any after his move from Slavik.
[385.72 - 393.72] P:1480.48 E:0.340319 |  And you can hear what England started the game has meant for the England supporters all around that little lift of atmosphere.
[393.72 - 401.72] P:1682.74 E:0.317332 |  We have a KG in here to start with. Kane has dropped very deep again, Splinter sent a harps for a moment as he hit a long diagonal four there for Saka.
[401.72 - 406.72] P:1417.49 E:0.279188 |  Now Bozhev got there and was able to head it back to his goalkeeper Thomas Fasnick.
[406.72 - 414.72] P:1502.14 E:0.287757 |  England coming into this with a few defensive worries only one goal can see them in the last eight games only five.
[414.76 - 418.76] P:1445.19 E:0.287097 |  In the last 18 matches it's going for it.
[418.76 - 422.76] P:1319.47 E:0.319917 |  Well England have had the worries but it's been a brighter start of the game.
[422.76 - 426.76] P:1537.52 E:0.321020 |  Faggott Nilnil here on Torch Sport in Yangtung a shock of long hair.
[426.76 - 431.76] P:1646.93 E:0.331604 |  Playing it back for his full back Bozhev. Thomas Kalash picking up possession.
[431.76 - 439.76] P:1611.39 E:0.331275 |  Working it back to his goalkeeper Thomas Fasnick who is on the books of Sevilla in Spain but hardly featured for them over the course of the season.
[439.80 - 443.80] P:1431.95 E:0.295847 |  Finally five league games in his campaign.
[443.80 - 448.80] P:1633.46 E:0.349364 |  Play for by Chaluska and a free kick scuba against Eklah Rice who's just caught Darida.
[448.80 - 451.80] P:1455.91 E:0.278352 |  That's a free kick the Czechs will take on Halfway.
[451.80 - 453.80] P:1470.15 E:0.306583 |  Five and a half gone Nilnil.
[453.80 - 459.80] P:1485.90 E:0.315482 |  In the previous games I don't think Harry Kane dropped deep enough to get on the ball and link player a little bit more.
[459.80 - 468.80] P:1586.48 E:0.331312 |  I don't know whether that's something they've had a look at but even in this game so early on he's dropped deep and he's also got Grealish and Sterling going into his slot as well.
[468.84 - 472.84] P:1517.02 E:0.329057 |  Which is causing a bit of a problem. It's not easy to mark when Kane does that.
[472.84 - 479.84] P:1439.08 E:0.322003 |  And if he can get turned and look for those balls the little diagonals in behind to stretch the opposition all well and good.
[479.84 - 484.84] P:1392.61 E:0.307730 |  Jack Grealish foul for the first and probably not the last time tonight so an even free kick on Halfway.
[484.84 - 488.84] P:1310.67 E:0.283335 |  Taking quickly for Luke Shaw.
[488.84 - 491.84] P:1172.05 E:0.281916 |  Get tempo about it from England as well.
[491.84 - 493.84] P:1425.44 E:0.310397 |  Perfect playing conditions really.
[493.88 - 498.88] P:1338.27 E:0.270143 |  A dry but pretty coolish night here in North London.
[498.88 - 501.88] P:1414.43 E:0.309498 |  John Stones in possession for England now.
[501.88 - 512.88] P:1356.26 E:0.331233 |  As you know this was an England back four that has played together once before and the victory with the clean sheet in Albania and the World Cup qualifiers back in the spring.
[512.88 - 515.88] P:1287.84 E:0.327311 |  Stones playing it forward here.
[515.88 - 519.88] P:1420.61 E:0.327648 |  Karl Walker has ventured forward tries to nod it down for Sacher.
[519.92 - 521.92] P:1450.67 E:0.301445 |  It's knocked away by Bozhel.
[521.92 - 525.92] P:1552.90 E:0.321270 |  Phillips goes up for it in the midfield so to Rice now they can get the ball under effective control.
[525.92 - 529.92] P:1474.85 E:0.317566 |  Ship links up the play but Rice is in there to knock it away from Derrida.
[529.92 - 533.92] P:1418.12 E:0.333604 |  Charles Lofa Safalda bring the ball forward down the right hand side.
[533.92 - 536.92] P:1530.21 E:0.330193 |  Just shipped down the right hand side of the penalty area.
[536.92 - 539.92] P:1693.68 E:0.338460 |  Stones comes out. There's Harry Maguire just there.
[539.92 - 541.92] P:1428.08 E:0.333943 |  Knock it away from Mazapuz.
[541.92 - 545.92] P:1307.40 E:0.365831 |  And it goes out for a throw that will be taken on the Czech Republic right.
[545.96 - 547.96] P:1262.82 E:0.350915 |  Seven goal at Mill now.
[547.96 - 553.96] P:1447.43 E:0.347579 |  Safalda right back with the ball in his hand trying to throw it forward over the top of Harry Maguire's head.
[553.96 - 555.96] P:1417.96 E:0.320502 |  Maguire doing well off balance.
[555.96 - 561.96] P:1547.79 E:0.318573 |  Henset away from Mazapuz who is trying to make the run in behind him and then Sterling clears in towards Harry Kane.
[561.96 - 564.96] P:1758.94 E:0.328789 |  Kane ends up on the deck as Chaliska wins the ball no foul.
[564.96 - 566.96] P:1647.29 E:0.250835 |  Socek wide for Safalda.
[566.96 - 568.96] P:1623.98 E:0.301374 |  High ball inside the penalty area.
[568.96 - 570.96] P:1844.57 E:0.303183 |  Really calmly defended by Karl Walker.
[571.00 - 575.00] P:1591.88 E:0.329205 |  And his chest doesn't bleed for the balls that straight out for Walker to be able to bring it forward.
[575.00 - 580.00] P:1696.78 E:0.305778 |  Again into the feet of Calvin Phillips who didn't heed the cry of Manon from his teammates.
[580.00 - 585.00] P:1349.31 E:0.281065 |  Derrida nearly embarrassing him but just out of a maintained possession.
[585.00 - 589.00] P:1329.66 E:0.310252 |  England can bring it a little bit further forward towards the edge of the centre circle.
[589.00 - 591.00] P:1508.87 E:0.275005 |  Declan Rice has got it.
[591.00 - 593.00] P:1604.52 E:0.320113 |  England hitting the post very early on with Raheem Sterling.
[593.00 - 596.00] P:1338.25 E:0.279398 |  And we threw eight minutes in both games.
[596.00 - 598.00] P:1527.24 E:0.282917 |  Still nil nils.
[598.04 - 600.04] P:1598.76 E:0.318340 |  And the Czechs win the group. England through in second.
[600.04 - 604.04] P:1419.40 E:0.311680 |  And Scotland and Croatia both out but a long, long way to go.
[604.04 - 607.04] P:1522.67 E:0.342034 |  Good to see you're on top of the permutations gym.
[607.04 - 616.04] P:1534.56 E:0.336651 |  I've seen your hand out there next to me and it is every possible conundrum that might happen at the end of this evening.
[616.04 - 620.04] P:1503.49 E:0.333185 |  It's easy at the moment when nothing has happened.
[620.04 - 624.04] P:1622.05 E:0.357339 |  And you'll have a free kick as Harry Kane has caught on.
[624.08 - 628.08] P:1567.37 E:0.324262 |  Just caught there by Thomas Callas who heard from Stuart Sol Campbell.
[628.08 - 630.08] P:1754.98 E:0.339529 |  Sol what have you made of the start?
[630.08 - 632.08] P:1482.80 E:0.333489 |  I think it's a fantastic start.
[632.08 - 636.08] P:1092.67 E:0.340817 |  I think everyone is nice to see all the England players on the half turn.
[636.08 - 638.08] P:1251.61 E:0.307190 |  Everyone is looking forward.
[638.08 - 641.08] P:1333.71 E:0.310213 |  The front line is packed up.
[641.08 - 643.08] P:1277.99 E:0.327351 |  They're playing the ball behind the Czechs.
[643.08 - 645.08] P:1414.05 E:0.291999 |  So it's a positive start.
[645.08 - 647.08] P:1308.51 E:0.228684 |  That's what we want.
[647.12 - 655.12] P:1596.55 E:0.345315 |  I think as well with the flexibility of Sterling, Grealish and Kane sort of interchanging positions almost,
[655.12 - 660.12] P:1454.98 E:0.341810 |  it will be really important that Shaw gives us plenty of width on the left hand side.
[660.12 - 662.12] P:1449.76 E:0.323000 |  Especially if he's got no one in front of him.
[662.12 - 670.12] P:1420.48 E:0.347768 |  Well England have decided rather than working this free kick short, which seemed the original intention that they've sent McGuire forward.
[670.12 - 675.12] P:1453.51 E:0.355707 |  First chance to launch one in towards the edge of the Czechs penalty area.
[675.16 - 677.16] P:1577.39 E:0.346261 |  Shaw the two players standing over it.
[677.16 - 679.16] P:1455.76 E:0.338194 |  The free kick itself is going to be taken only about ten yards aside.
[679.16 - 683.16] P:1464.44 E:0.313863 |  Czech territory, short stands with his right arm above his head.
[683.16 - 691.16] P:1559.22 E:0.313595 |  And prepares to just angler left footed ball in towards the far post where it was attacked well by John Stones.
[691.16 - 693.16] P:1668.20 E:0.292557 |  But couldn't really get the contact that he wanted.
[693.16 - 697.16] P:1681.11 E:0.319131 |  So instead of going across the edge of the six yard box flew wider than near post.
[697.16 - 700.16] P:1671.58 E:0.299279 |  Goes out of play for a goal kick, but a decent first ten minutes.
[700.16 - 703.16] P:1497.81 E:0.315693 |  Or be it still Callas on the soft spot.
[703.20 - 705.20] P:1542.20 E:0.308053 |  Yeah, it's been a very good start.
[705.20 - 709.20] P:1447.34 E:0.319286 |  We've turned the opposition round on a couple of occasions, which has been really good.
[709.20 - 718.20] P:1454.36 E:0.340209 |  Interchange as Soul mentioned, players getting on the half term, which is really important when you've got the likes of Grealish and Sterling in your ranks as well.
[718.20 - 725.20] P:1362.11 E:0.357103 |  And just on that occasion, just looking to see who picked up McGuire as the two centrioles went forward and split.
[725.20 - 731.20] P:1350.04 E:0.309064 |  And it was Sue Czeck, who's obviously been told McGuire is East responsibility.
[732.20 - 734.20] P:1238.02 E:0.347175 |  As Harry McGuire has got the ball at his feet now.
[734.20 - 739.20] P:1413.16 E:0.308352 |  First time he's played at any football since May the 9th.
[740.20 - 745.20] P:1538.52 E:0.336113 |  Ball went back for Calvin Phillips, one right footed ball over the top, trying to get Sacher in behind the retreat in Boswell.
[745.20 - 747.20] P:1794.95 E:0.305789 |  And it fell for Kane.
[747.20 - 753.20] P:1593.44 E:0.323694 |  Well, well for the tenth, and he was off balance, and it has to live a bit awkwardly for him 25 yards out.
[753.20 - 755.20] P:1440.76 E:0.309775 |  He's raffled it over the bar as a result of that.
[755.20 - 759.20] P:1561.50 E:0.315075 |  But England getting themselves in good positions in the early stages.
[759.20 - 766.20] P:1601.75 E:0.322760 |  Let me remind you, over on Torchport 2, right now, live from Handemite, stroking Chrissie Wellemo, talking through Scotland against Croatia.
[766.20 - 773.20] P:1529.08 E:0.336128 |  Still nil nil in that game, just a one shot in the first ten minutes, which was an off-target effort from the Scots.
[773.20 - 781.20] P:1428.00 E:0.317083 |  Victory for them, and they will, the four points definitely make it through in some position in the group.
[781.20 - 785.20] P:1270.92 E:0.317476 |  Almost certainly in third, but would be through.
[785.20 - 794.20] P:1539.16 E:0.332993 |  If you finish third, incidentally, the chances are, and it's not guaranteed, the chances are you'd get the Netherlands in Budapest if you finish third in this group.
[794.20 - 799.20] P:1677.81 E:0.343899 |  Sacher with a chance to run forward now, lays it out towards his right.
[799.20 - 806.20] P:1740.04 E:0.303076 |  Calvin Phillips is there, plenty of space, good ball back into the finish, Sacher, the twist turns inside the area, stands it up towards the far post.
[806.20 - 809.20] P:1832.88 E:0.294162 |  The retreating, Greenish hands it down, Kane back to her as a good ball.
[809.20 - 814.20] P:1757.62 E:0.321182 |  Greenish now, faced up by two, chips him in towards the far post, and it's headed in.
[814.20 - 822.20] P:1718.45 E:0.309968 |  What a start from England, a goal up inside 11 minutes, and Raheem Sterling does it again, his second of the tournament.
[822.20 - 832.20] P:1647.90 E:0.312742 |  A brilliant England start, has a tangible reward, and it's Raheem Sterling, just a stone's throw from where he was brought up, underlining his status.
[832.20 - 836.20] P:1504.27 E:0.315709 |  England won, the Czech Republic nil.
[836.20 - 841.20] P:1522.15 E:0.339583 |  Well England have punctuated that good start by a goal, fantastic goal.
[841.20 - 849.20] P:1470.96 E:0.322726 |  And Phillips done brilliantly well, in his own half, search past Sucek, that all of a sudden opened things up for England.
[849.20 - 864.20] P:1434.62 E:0.319176 |  Once Kane got on the ball, supplied Greenish out wide, and a deaf little chip to the far post was fantastic, and arguably one of the smallest players on the pitch, in at the far post for his second goal Sterling.
[864.20 - 874.20] P:1623.05 E:0.334574 |  This performance so far, chalk and cheese with what we've seen so far in the tournament, including the Croatia game as well, he deserved that early advantage.
[874.20 - 882.20] P:1317.13 E:0.349981 |  Fantastic really, their relentless play in all the second phases, kept the ball alive, fantastic.
[882.20 - 890.20] P:1497.44 E:0.354195 |  Also as well Jim in his early stages, they've turned the opposition round, sometimes the balls have been cut out, but what they've done is said,
[890.20 - 896.20] P:1550.72 E:0.349719 |  we're prepared to go in behind you, which is freed space up as well in front of the back line.
[896.20 - 905.20] P:1594.88 E:0.327843 |  Strong challenge comes in the midfield from Declan Rice, the Czechs on the front foot, looking for an immediate response with Janktovi.
[905.20 - 915.20] P:1648.53 E:0.320692 |  Left wingers out to the right, he's sent a cross come shot in, which is blocked by a combination of Shaw and Grilish, comes back out for Sifal, Sifal to Darada.
[915.20 - 922.20] P:1595.47 E:0.316090 |  Right footed ball, chips inside the penalty area from the centre half to Luska, and England are able to turn that one away.
[922.20 - 931.20] P:1552.64 E:0.350786 |  Back it comes from Hollash, who is a defensive midfielder, not a natural candidate to wear the number nine shirt, he's turned it forward, but the offside flag is up,
[931.20 - 935.20] P:1434.36 E:0.349746 |  and it's a free kick to England, just a sign of chance to calm things down.
[935.20 - 945.20] P:1368.74 E:0.345285 |  So as it stands then, England would top the group, and the Czechs would come second, Croatia third, and Scotland fourth.
[945.20 - 952.20] P:1477.25 E:0.349198 |  One nil to England, Raheem Sterling, the man that scored the winner against Croatia, making it two in three games in this tournament,
[952.20 - 964.20] P:1469.11 E:0.338466 |  two in fifteen tournament games in his career, that's his sixteenth goal for England, fourteen of them have come in the last nineteen games, which is an outstanding return.
[964.20 - 973.20] P:1394.28 E:0.353226 |  And he got a hat trick against the Czechs in qualifying, and he's given England the perfect start, but just a word of caution,
[973.20 - 978.20] P:1484.38 E:0.350328 |  and England took the lead the last time that they played the Czechs, that was in pride, they were a goal of five minutes that day,
[978.20 - 985.20] P:1278.45 E:0.335168 |  and they came back pretty quickly and ended up losing, but England have done everything that could have been asked of them so far.
[985.20 - 995.20] P:1528.25 E:0.312896 |  They hit the post and scored, as Maguire plays it forward, Kane again dropping deeper, but dropping deeper with much more effectiveness than he did against the Scots.
[995.20 - 1001.20] P:1576.76 E:0.328164 |  Try to release Saka, Bolshev on the back foot, gets it back to his goalkeeper, Fatslik desperate to get it onto his right foot,
[1001.20 - 1007.20] P:1586.39 E:0.340456 |  which put all kinds of pressure off the ball there, England pressing from the front, winning back with Greenish,
[1007.20 - 1013.20] P:1658.17 E:0.341856 |  who has just lost his footing under pressure, and wins a free kick, wired on the left hand touch line,
[1013.20 - 1017.20] P:1523.45 E:0.358333 |  and a chance for England to get the bodies forward, a potentially score of Saka.
[1017.20 - 1029.20] P:1332.82 E:0.352161 |  Yeah, a little too sharp there from Masapust and, let's say, Greenish, just got a foul in this wide area, probably eighteen, nineteen meters out,
[1029.20 - 1032.20] P:1289.80 E:0.342791 |  and a good opportunity for Saka to whip one in.
[1032.20 - 1039.20] P:1312.62 E:0.345848 |  So Saka comes across the table, England have got plenty of bodies forward,
[1039.20 - 1045.20] P:1524.17 E:0.327588 |  and I'm sure his back walk is back, but everybody else is in there in a position to attack it.
[1045.20 - 1052.20] P:1612.99 E:0.328822 |  Greenish wakes outside the penalty area for any second ball, Phillips making a run from the edge of the D, everybody else inside the penalty area,
[1052.20 - 1059.20] P:1597.01 E:0.336758 |  Phillips starts in towards the near post, no flick on forthcoming, but it's sneered away and goes just the right side of the corner flag for England,
[1059.20 - 1063.20] P:1640.79 E:0.318187 |  for a corner which we take him on the left flank.
[1063.20 - 1066.20] P:1545.44 E:0.302647 |  England won the Czech Republic Neal on talk sport.
[1067.20 - 1077.20] P:1304.90 E:0.347260 |  England always, when we see them in the main play with an air of confidence, they've been asked to take the ball from the back and be composed in their football,
[1077.20 - 1083.20] P:1339.12 E:0.332488 |  but I think tonight a good start and the goal probably is exactly what they needed to settle them down the touch.
[1083.20 - 1086.20] P:1552.09 E:0.339292 |  In comes the corner from short half clear, and out only as far as Saka.
[1086.20 - 1090.20] P:1732.14 E:0.340573 |  Saka, edge of the area, I thought he was brought down referee says no foul,
[1090.20 - 1095.20] P:1638.42 E:0.333623 |  much as though he's going to point for a free kick on the edge of the D, he didn't, the Czechs will try and break,
[1095.20 - 1104.20] P:1564.76 E:0.329248 |  Sterling's done well, hasn't won the ball back, but he has forced the error, and Schick couldn't quite control it, runs out of play for a throw.
[1108.20 - 1114.20] P:1535.68 E:0.330146 |  But everybody from an England perspective, I rate that they felt it should have been a free kick at the other end of the field,
[1114.20 - 1117.20] P:1449.09 E:0.318716 |  and will be an England throw to restart play.
[1117.20 - 1124.20] P:1547.58 E:0.299933 |  Now a moment of significance at Hamden Park, where Croatia leads Scotland by a golden ill.
[1124.20 - 1132.20] P:1401.38 E:0.308981 |  So the perfect start for England, not the perfect start for Scotland, who are going to have to come from behind to win that game,
[1132.20 - 1142.20] P:1526.18 E:0.317442 |  if there to stay in the tournament. Croatia leading by a golden ill, that game lie for you right now, over on talk sport too,
[1142.20 - 1146.20] P:1449.77 E:0.307331 |  that was the former Everton man, Nikola Vlasic, that got the goal.
[1149.20 - 1155.20] P:1533.10 E:0.364730 |  And it's just, they put up on the big screen, that's the cheer you can hear from the England supporters.
[1156.20 - 1164.20] P:1410.47 E:0.355708 |  Sean, on the right wing, only a couple of yards in for the right hand side, very similar position to the free kick that England had created,
[1164.20 - 1169.20] P:1467.00 E:0.355066 |  just two or three minutes previously, and a chance for Jaktar to put a decent delivery in here,
[1169.20 - 1172.20] P:1503.68 E:0.338137 |  the first set piece test for England to defence you.
[1172.20 - 1179.20] P:1545.89 E:0.345429 |  Yeah, and as I say, these are dangerous, you know, I'm acutely aware of Sučec's power in the air,
[1179.20 - 1185.20] P:1340.17 E:0.270754 |  Šik as well, as demonstrated, and they've got a decent presence in the box as well.
[1185.20 - 1191.20] P:1195.12 E:0.271099 |  Decent balling will cause a problem, it's an out swing by Kufal potentially.
[1192.20 - 1200.20] P:1427.93 E:0.232124 |  Jankto puts his right arm above his head, six in there to attack it, works short actually towards the edge of the penalty area.
[1200.20 - 1207.20] P:1742.51 E:0.308215 |  Darin are taking a touch, pressurised by Saka, now they work it wide out to the left hand side of the penalty area,
[1207.20 - 1213.20] P:1741.38 E:0.305010 |  no cross forth coming yet, Jankto still got it though, left footed ball comes in now on his block well by Philips,
[1213.20 - 1218.20] P:1741.05 E:0.273109 |  and goes out of play for a throw on the Czech left wing.
[1218.20 - 1224.20] P:1502.18 E:0.251828 |  England won the Czechs nil, Scotland mill Croatia won.
[1224.20 - 1231.20] P:1456.74 E:0.331203 |  I'm not sure that they took the right option now, really don't, they decided not to whip the ball in the box from a really good area out wide,
[1231.20 - 1237.20] P:1543.47 E:0.313603 |  played it short across the face of the box, trying to get a shooting opportunity that was never there.
[1237.20 - 1248.20] P:1313.00 E:0.301894 |  Chance just to calm things down for Jordan Pickford, ball in his hand, just drops it down inside the penalty area now.
[1248.20 - 1255.20] P:1466.48 E:0.294770 |  Don't forget Josie Mourinho is back with us tonight in the final hour of our program after the conclusion of this game.
[1255.20 - 1261.20] P:1481.41 E:0.328981 |  We'll be hearing from our England correspondent Faker others who will be speaking to Darin Southgate and all the headliners,
[1261.20 - 1266.20] P:1661.03 E:0.318733 |  and we've finished here at 11, Jason Cundey and Andy Goldstein taking your calls on national radio tonight,
[1266.20 - 1274.20] P:1661.38 E:0.296236 |  I know they're 717-223-44 the number, get your calls in, have you say on Talksport from 11 on the Sports Bar Euro Game Day Live tonight,
[1274.20 - 1282.20] P:1449.13 E:0.270619 |  and tomorrow morning Euro Sports Breakfast Laura Woods, Allie McCoyst and Andros Townsend, at the moment Andros will be happier than Allie.
[1282.20 - 1287.20] P:1721.17 E:0.314281 |  Jankto, bring the ball forward, left hand side of the penalty area here for the Czechs, still a long way to go,
[1287.20 - 1292.20] P:1748.60 E:0.288194 |  ball inside the penalty area intended for Schick, Stones is in there, ducks his head in, heads it away,
[1292.20 - 1300.20] P:1574.19 E:0.289460 |  and it goes out of play for a throw on the Czech Republic left hand side, a spirited response without Jordan Pickford having to make a save yet.
[1300.20 - 1308.20] P:1577.66 E:0.283011 |  20 gone, England leading after Raheem Sterling's 12 minute goal, the Czechs a little reverse ball inside the area that Saka can knock away,
[1308.20 - 1315.20] P:1511.76 E:0.263854 |  Kane the only out ball for England and he's putting the pressure on Tjeliska with an economy of effort,
[1315.20 - 1322.20] P:1316.79 E:0.232313 |  knowing the battles to try and win and the battles that are definitely going to be lost,
[1322.20 - 1328.20] P:1375.32 E:0.261692 |  as a consequence he just let the ball run back there, Grealish puts the press on with a little bit more intent,
[1328.20 - 1333.20] P:1503.27 E:0.262676 |  the Czechs will try and play it forward, Sochette letting the ball run through them infield, England win it back,
[1333.20 - 1340.20] P:1744.61 E:0.288389 |  Sterling playing it forward, now Kane goes up through the gears, Karas read the situation well and slid in and knocked it away from him.
[1340.20 - 1348.20] P:1362.60 E:0.197696 |  And the Czechs mop it up with Sochette and he will bring it inside the centre circle and fan Hollash,
[1348.20 - 1357.20] P:1396.94 E:0.246693 |  laid back to Sochette again, it's all blonde haired West Hammedfield defines his club teammate, Saffal, back for Sochette again,
[1357.20 - 1363.20] P:1429.79 E:0.247803 |  Mazapust on the right hand touch line, Sochette tries a little nutmeg of Luke Shaw,
[1363.20 - 1369.20] P:1514.51 E:0.274244 |  Darada goes down no foul, played away by Harry Maguire just chip forward for Raheem Sterling,
[1369.20 - 1374.20] P:1590.02 E:0.271886 |  couldn't find him but Declan Rice wins the seconds, he turns it forward just over the head of Raheem Sterling
[1374.20 - 1380.20] P:1727.77 E:0.298165 |  and the Czechs in their blood red shirts able to bring the ball forward again and then another foul by Shaw
[1380.20 - 1386.20] P:1630.38 E:0.255700 |  who's blocked off Darada's progress on the right flank and it's a free kick which will be taken by the Czechs midway,
[1386.20 - 1393.20] P:1449.35 E:0.235628 |  inside the England half, Czech Republic nil, England one, Croatia leading Scotland by a golden nil,
[1393.20 - 1398.20] P:1586.90 E:0.290099 |  very nearly two with a Luke and Modric effort that's just been tipped over the bar by David Marshall,
[1398.20 - 1404.20] P:1656.37 E:0.262882 |  but both games still one nil, England leading, Scotland losing, free kick taken by the Czechs,
[1404.20 - 1408.20] P:1721.62 E:0.272341 |  chipped inside the penalty area just trying to be a little bit too quick and cute,
[1408.20 - 1412.20] P:1658.74 E:0.282741 |  and it was over the shoulder and Mazapust straight into the hands of Jordan Piffer.
[1412.20 - 1421.20] P:1590.84 E:0.298692 |  The Czechs have had two free kicks now and they really push up high, their lost man's probably about 30 yards out from the England goal
[1421.20 - 1430.20] P:1437.41 E:0.280282 |  and any turnover of possession, a quick counter-attack, a fanciest, maybe if we can turn ball over and get away quickly
[1430.20 - 1434.20] P:1418.14 E:0.261667 |  for the likes of certainly Sterling's pace and Saka's pace.
[1434.20 - 1441.20] P:1469.68 E:0.315836 |  Coming up more live sport on Cross the network this week tomorrow, then we'll find out who they're going to be playing definitively tomorrow,
[1441.20 - 1450.20] P:1678.57 E:0.281602 |  5 o'clock Slovakia, Spain and Sweden Poland over on Talksport 2 and then at 8 o'clock it's Portugal, France and over on 2 is Germany against Hungary,
[1450.20 - 1456.20] P:1603.85 E:0.304469 |  and that's coming up for you tomorrow, Luxor chesting the ball down here is just offside,
[1456.20 - 1463.20] P:1614.57 E:0.288660 |  and they gallivanting run forward and took Jankto back with him, interesting that they first swapped the two wingers over already,
[1463.20 - 1471.20] P:1412.17 E:0.262407 |  and that's coming down towards this right hand side, just trying to deal with the attacking forays of Luxor down the England left,
[1471.20 - 1479.20] P:1453.58 E:0.273498 |  a free kick taken for the offside is, we're back to Čeluska, Czechs have a reputation for being a side that are good at pressing high,
[1479.20 - 1486.20] P:1609.28 E:0.279816 |  they certainly do it more than most other teams in the tournament and they target the full backs when they have possession,
[1486.20 - 1491.20] P:1323.79 E:0.241528 |  but haven't been able to do it to good effect at all so far this evening.
[1491.20 - 1500.20] P:1364.22 E:0.252083 |  Jankto coming into a more central area now, the Czech Republic midfielder wearing 14, 4 from him to Matrix Schick,
[1500.20 - 1505.20] P:1611.79 E:0.307388 |  3 goals to his name in the tournament so Vasa foul to Mazapust on the right, fired in by him,
[1505.20 - 1511.20] P:1727.35 E:0.300319 |  chested down calmly by Kyle Walker, he's only about 3.5-4 yards out,
[1511.20 - 1517.20] P:1519.10 E:0.296558 |  and Jordan Pickford had to be alert just to make sure that there was no embarrassment there, 1-0 to England on Talksport.
[1517.20 - 1527.20] P:1599.35 E:0.311487 |  I'll tell you what, the Czechs have put 2 or 3 balls in in perfect areas, we're fortunate to have defenders in and around the drop zone.
[1527.20 - 1534.20] P:1695.22 E:0.255475 |  Saka, lovely turn, he's gone all the way round, Hollish, and Stilly has it on the edge of the penalty area, Stilly's got it,
[1534.20 - 1543.20] P:1756.99 E:0.301739 |  Hollish stuck a foot in, England pick it up with Sterling, 25 yards down, sure goes to his left, Sterling works it in towards Harry Kane,
[1543.20 - 1550.20] P:1806.06 E:0.283008 |  receives it with his back to the direction of play, but tees up Calvin Phillips, back from Philips to Walker, corner of the penalty area,
[1550.20 - 1558.20] P:1745.65 E:0.292709 |  back behind Square for Rice, but he's got space, and he finds Jack Greeley towards the edge of the box, little layup from him to the left for Luke Shaw,
[1558.20 - 1566.20] P:1770.51 E:0.312752 |  Shaw's ball in towards the far post, he's headed away, England still playing with the dynamism and a purpose around the edge of the Czech penalty area,
[1566.20 - 1574.20] P:1662.25 E:0.244272 |  and the crowd loving what they're seeing, Maguire, now to Rice, Sterling drops out a little bit deeper to pick it up,
[1574.20 - 1585.20] P:1493.29 E:0.241007 |  good rotation and fluidity from England, Rice, good ball between the lines, finds Kane, Kane to Philips to Greeley, Shaw, then to Sterling,
[1585.20 - 1595.20] P:1567.92 E:0.246022 |  almost quickly as you can say it, England's tempo impressive, Sterling, back to Greeley, she takes it on the half turn and works it back inside the centre circle for John Stones,
[1595.20 - 1605.20] P:1502.41 E:0.216102 |  but Stones can bring it forward, just a conservative ball from him and we haven't seen too many from England yet, Stones finding Philips,
[1605.20 - 1614.20] P:1542.83 E:0.238194 |  Philips to Saka, now to Maguire, Maguire bringing it forward, and then it's an excellent ball, he's found Harry Kane, Kane checks,
[1614.20 - 1622.20] P:1785.49 E:0.281988 |  good save from the goalkeeper, Kane got it back onto his right foot, his best moment of the tournament so far, bottom left hand corner of the six-yard box,
[1622.20 - 1628.20] P:1887.58 E:0.273123 |  cross come shot, hoping that if the keeper saved it he'd just pound it down in the path of Sterling, it's a really good stop from the keeper,
[1628.20 - 1637.20] P:1726.83 E:0.289663 |  it took all the pace out of it and the Czechs were able to hammer it away, but another good England move and it ends up in a corner, which will be taken on the left flank by Luke Shaw.
[1637.20 - 1647.20] P:1505.58 E:0.283542 |  Top quality movement there by Kane, Maguire's ball was fantastic, he also had a run of Sterling going the other way as well, which stretched the Czech backline.
[1648.20 - 1657.20] P:1757.60 E:0.265699 |  Shaw takes a couple of steps, fires the corner in, bounces once on the edge of the penalty area, straight through for Philips, Philips to Saka, Saka to Grealish,
[1657.20 - 1669.20] P:1743.95 E:0.290152 |  Grealish drifting in, good ball into a dangerous area, John Stones there to attack it, but headed away by Cieluska, and it'll be brought down on the right hand side of the Czech midfield by Masapust who was pushed by Grealish,
[1669.20 - 1683.20] P:1651.58 E:0.284531 |  contact minimal, but free kick probably the right decision, in front of Artadias the referee, it was actually the man that took charge of England's 5-0 win against the Czechs back in 2019,
[1683.20 - 1693.20] P:1662.06 E:0.276177 |  and he's given a free kick here to the Czechs in their right back position, England leading the Czechs by Golden Hill, now let's check in with Sol Campbell, Sol, still happy?
[1693.20 - 1702.20] P:1397.67 E:0.293290 |  Yes, yes, I think it's a fantastic start, the movement between Sterling, Saka and Grealish is fantastic, and that's what we want, that kind of movement.
[1702.20 - 1713.20] P:1616.55 E:0.202762 |  Patrick Schick just chesting it down, laying it back towards Masapust, Masapust to Sofal, Sofal 10 yards outside the penalty area, back for Thomas Socek,
[1713.20 - 1726.20] P:1517.60 E:0.220236 |  and Socek turning, Czechs able to bring the ball forward, England have got everybody but Harry came back behind the ball here, and that defensive effort has got the ball half clear, but only half clear,
[1726.20 - 1741.20] P:1864.15 E:0.282431 |  Socek shot from distance from Hollash, and Jordan Pickford did well, diving away to his right hand side, beat it round the post for a corner, but the recriminations were instant, not happy at the amount of space that was given around the edge of the penalty area there,
[1741.20 - 1743.20] P:1766.09 E:0.315872 |  and the Czechs have their first corner of the night.
[1743.20 - 1752.20] P:1495.70 E:0.283079 |  Yeah, I'm not sure who could have got it any closer to be fair, it was some distance, but it was arrowed right in the corner, and it was a very good save by Pickford.
[1753.20 - 1763.20] P:1732.56 E:0.278992 |  Yanktop preparing to take this corner, it's a left-footed away swinger towards the penalty spot, Hollash going up for it, won the initial ball, it might bounce down, a little bit of pinball inside the penalty area,
[1763.20 - 1776.20] P:1752.20 E:0.272968 |  Sakaba will be able to take it away, then he turned in looking towards the danger zone, and has ended up conceding possession, it's a throw which will be taken on the Czech right hand side,
[1776.20 - 1779.20] P:1412.02 E:0.175468 |  and Mazapust is going to leave it for Sofar.
[1779.20 - 1795.20] P:1373.60 E:0.250395 |  Some of the quality they've put in our box already in this game, you know they've not got people on the end of things in the main, but the quality of passing to the box, and the aerial threat that they do have, it could be a real problem for us if we don't get that defensive line right.
[1795.20 - 1799.20] P:1622.47 E:0.254262 |  And they've just won another corner off Lutschaw, which is the Czechs second.
[1799.20 - 1810.20] P:1499.59 E:0.290999 |  A reminder that Croatia leads Scotland 1-0 right now over on Talksport 2 England leading this one 1-0, so as he stands it's England first, the Czechs second, Croatia third and Scotland out.
[1812.20 - 1822.20] P:1772.47 E:0.298672 |  England have got Harry Kane back to attack the ball on the edge of the six-yard box, everybody else in behind them and it's bounced down a little bit awkwardly, shot comes in, that's blocked, Lutschaw against it half clear.
[1822.20 - 1839.20] P:1717.05 E:0.281952 |  Darida, Czechs asking some questions now, good header away by Harry Maguire in the heart of the defence, and turn further forward, Kane on the counter attack, he's got the beating of Sofar for pace, but right back just had enough of a head start to be able to get there first, and he'll guide it back for Boschel.
[1839.20 - 1854.20] P:1475.58 E:0.247929 |  The Czechs will be able to mop up, undoubtedly the last seven or eight minutes has been their best period of the game so far, and just a couple of warning shots across the bowels, England know that there's a lot of ground to go in this game, yeah, one mil better England.
[1854.20 - 1868.20] P:1525.11 E:0.265773 |  Without a doubt, they're showing such a good threat from balls into the box, I mean they must have put at least six good balls, good quality crosses into dangerous areas and it took a real scramble to get that one clear.
[1869.20 - 1891.20] P:1490.40 E:0.240286 |  They're on the side, they're trying to play pretty direct, fast football at a good tempo, they play with a lot of transition, Mazapust and Jankto trying to get in from wider positions, Jankto has been given a free roll tonight, he's lurking everywhere, and he's the furthest forward now as the Czechs try to work it down the left hand side and they win a throw.
[1891.20 - 1896.20] P:1579.17 E:0.279697 |  Assault, what have you been most concerned about so far from a defensive perspective?
[1896.20 - 1912.20] P:1481.70 E:0.282227 |  Definitely, what she was saying, the threat from set plays, the threats from crosses, you know, they're a big unit and they're industrious kind of players and they'll keep on fighting so the main thing, don't give those too many free kicks in and around our box.
[1912.20 - 1925.20] P:1502.19 E:0.252971 |  Jankto takes a tumble inside the penalty area but no real appeal thrown that it should be a penalty. Long clearance from the Czech Republic back line, brought down by Jankto trying to get the better of stones.
[1926.20 - 1950.20] P:1422.31 E:0.251331 |  The Czechs have dominated possession over the last 10 minutes or so, still England with the majority of it in the game as a whole. This has been another feature of England's tournament so far, their ability to start games, start halves of games very quickly and then perhaps just lose that tempo and see the little bit of the advantage the half-wear is on.
[1950.20 - 1963.20] P:1438.82 E:0.278516 |  That's been the case again here this evening, brilliant start, the first 20 minutes were exemplary from England but since then the Czechs have been able to sort a few things out and have been the better team.
[1963.20 - 1968.20] P:1398.51 E:0.269908 |  Still England have the advantage, courtesy of that 12 minute goal from Raheem Sterling.
[1968.20 - 1984.20] P:1426.38 E:0.281762 |  I think if we can come through periods like this where we're under a bit of sustained pressure, it will stand us in good stead later on in the tournament where undoubtedly when you're up against the better teams you've got to sustain attacks and cope with that and come out with a clear head.
[1985.20 - 1999.20] P:1141.77 E:0.148603 |  One middle to England, so far, playing it back to Andrzej Cieluška who had a lone spad at Sunderland early in his career.
[1999.20 - 2007.20] P:1342.31 E:0.240372 |  Playing his football these days for Spada Prague and his homeland, Bozil the left back, down towards Jankto, was back on the left flank for a moment.
[2007.20 - 2016.20] P:1369.19 E:0.304453 |  They're a well-drilled outfit the Czechs, that is for sure, you can see that in their play, they're organised and they know exactly what they're trying to achieve in the game.
[2016.20 - 2024.20] P:1635.48 E:0.323658 |  Yaroslav Šulový the coach who on four, Kasper Ček is a vacuum in the 90s, a very well regarded coach.
[2024.20 - 2028.20] P:1691.70 E:0.306671 |  England on the front foot here, they won another call, yes they have, a sack of...
[2029.20 - 2035.20] P:1617.69 E:0.330045 |  With his pace, a good outlet for England on the counter attack, making ground at the right hand side firing an early cross in.
[2035.20 - 2041.20] P:1532.84 E:0.290795 |  And the Czechs deflected away for another corner which is England's third. One middle to England, 32 minutes gone.
[2041.20 - 2054.20] P:1488.53 E:0.303930 |  It's that little bit of pace that Sol was talking about that Šak has got, you know, he's got the ability to burst past and we got two or three players in the match-ups that have got the ability to do that and leave Czech players in their wake.
[2055.20 - 2062.20] P:1385.25 E:0.260023 |  England's third corner will be taken on the right flank. Raheem Sterling stands inside the six-yard box.
[2063.20 - 2071.20] P:1460.45 E:0.286632 |  Stones and Maguire both there to attack it but just a little bit too much air underneath it and it was easily headed away.
[2071.20 - 2075.20] P:1500.68 E:0.272899 |  England then go all the way back to Jordan Pickford from Kyle Walker.
[2075.20 - 2082.20] P:1514.62 E:0.220144 |  Pickford will play it out again and find Luke Shaw and Shaw's got easy possession on half way.
[2084.20 - 2088.20] P:1493.77 E:0.268994 |  Back from him to Declan Rice, Rice slowing it down just for a moment to find Walker.
[2088.20 - 2093.20] P:1523.73 E:0.279913 |  Walker dropped in between the two set of halves then passes it one stop further down the line for Stones.
[2093.20 - 2099.20] P:1393.27 E:0.199678 |  Out of the England right for Grealish, Calvin Phillips for Stones again.
[2099.20 - 2105.20] P:1608.43 E:0.279285 |  Now England have had a couple of episodes like this but it's not possession for possession sake as much as it was against the Scots.
[2105.20 - 2108.20] P:1516.74 E:0.266052 |  Because they do look for a long diagonal there for Walker.
[2108.20 - 2111.20] P:1852.07 E:0.295059 |  Rice then heads it forward after the initial ball was repelled.
[2111.20 - 2114.20] P:1745.95 E:0.287514 |  Walker picking up the seconds, Kane back towards it was at a handball.
[2114.20 - 2117.20] P:1469.16 E:0.285146 |  Referee again put whistle in the mouth and thought better of it.
[2117.20 - 2119.20] P:1656.46 E:0.266606 |  Kane winning it back finds Grealish.
[2119.20 - 2124.20] P:1803.60 E:0.277803 |  Grealish towards the edge of the deep, hits the referee, it's going to be a drop ball ref, surely.
[2125.20 - 2127.20] P:1303.30 E:0.116452 |  Danny Wolby.
[2127.20 - 2131.20] P:1453.28 E:0.266746 |  I looked for a moment so he wasn't going to give it but it was an England player that played it into it.
[2131.20 - 2139.20] P:1521.03 E:0.257632 |  He couldn't have seen actually the referee who had the touch that fired it into him there because it came from behind him.
[2139.20 - 2143.20] P:1394.35 E:0.247005 |  It will be a drop ball to England and play resumes with Rice.
[2143.20 - 2147.20] P:1423.65 E:0.260983 |  Rice to Phillips, Maguire now for Shaw.
[2147.20 - 2153.20] P:1639.30 E:0.289082 |  Grealish had made a good run down the left back created space for Sterling in a more central area but he couldn't find a way through.
[2153.20 - 2161.20] P:1433.48 E:0.199780 |  It was Tomasz Hollash that sort of that and Yankta has it now and will play it through the midfield.
[2161.20 - 2163.20] P:1171.02 E:0.206474 |  England still leading 1-0.
[2163.20 - 2172.20] P:1454.55 E:0.252595 |  The cloud which has been seemingly a perennial feature of the London skyline over the last four or five days has now disappeared.
[2172.20 - 2176.20] P:1360.61 E:0.224972 |  A beautiful blue sky evening here at Wembley.
[2176.20 - 2178.20] P:1147.99 E:0.081574 |  Yankta.
[2178.20 - 2181.20] P:1182.58 E:0.177395 |  Derrida, right footed ball into space for him.
[2181.20 - 2185.20] P:1625.62 E:0.298375 |  Karl Walker defending narrow has an outboschalled the opportunity to bring it forward here.
[2185.20 - 2189.20] P:1762.61 E:0.283568 |  Right footed ball in, Yankta trying to set that fly and he's put just wide.
[2189.20 - 2192.20] P:1705.70 E:0.227588 |  Glorious opportunity for Socek.
[2192.20 - 2194.20] P:1785.92 E:0.264979 |  The clearest chance so far.
[2194.20 - 2199.20] P:1778.44 E:0.267919 |  Loose ball falling to him a good 18 yards out and he had to hit it first time.
[2199.20 - 2206.20] P:1660.27 E:0.251491 |  But if he could have found the far post, Pickford would have been nowhere near it and England are mightily relieved that it's crept a fraction wide.
[2206.20 - 2212.20] P:1556.98 E:0.233046 |  Well this might come as a surprise to you but the Czechs have put another good cross in the box.
[2212.20 - 2214.20] P:1814.99 E:0.275825 |  Yankta it was on that occasion.
[2214.20 - 2220.20] P:1568.78 E:0.257521 |  Luke Shaw very very brave putting his head in the way and then when it fell to Socek
[2220.20 - 2222.20] P:1492.03 E:0.228590 |  I was waiting for the net to ripple.
[2222.20 - 2224.20] P:1442.43 E:0.199323 |  Rice has gone out.
[2224.20 - 2228.20] P:1187.34 E:0.250978 |  Potato and Spud is it? Brigade, the pair of them.
[2228.20 - 2230.20] P:1756.19 E:0.251375 |  Rice is going out.
[2230.20 - 2236.20] P:1606.63 E:0.270112 |  Potato and Spud, that well-known player that plays for you.
[2236.20 - 2245.20] P:1645.44 E:0.272142 |  Listen I'm just pleased that Deck was there and just shut the angle slightly but they've certainly caused the odd skirmish and looking at the game at this moment in time
[2245.20 - 2251.20] P:1543.49 E:0.249039 |  it might take another goal to actually win this game the way the Czechs are pressurizing our goal.
[2251.20 - 2253.20] P:1433.70 E:0.221909 |  You're just wondering what we're talking about incidentally.
[2253.20 - 2265.20] P:1538.65 E:0.244216 |  Declan Rice and Thomas Socek apparently according to one article in the press that they know as Rice and Potato Salad at West Ham which was news to the West Ham contingent in our team.
[2265.20 - 2273.20] P:1530.59 E:0.234516 |  Which either means it's not true or you're completely out of the loop of what goes on at your club and you're not in any of the WhatsApp groups.
[2273.20 - 2276.20] P:1691.83 E:0.290599 |  Neither would surprise me if I'm being honest with you.
[2276.20 - 2279.20] P:1736.53 E:0.304063 |  Either it's not true or be that I know nothing about it.
[2279.20 - 2285.20] P:1547.77 E:0.243386 |  Here's Socek again in possession, played for Rice, able to mop up and he lays it back for John Stones.
[2285.20 - 2294.20] P:1696.35 E:0.248959 |  Stones chipping for us, a great take by Calvin Phillips, stretched out the right leg, brought it down, then used it really intelligently, played it forward for Bukai Osaka.
[2294.20 - 2300.20] P:1891.67 E:0.284708 |  He finds Grealish, sterling on his bike to his left hand side, Grealish drives on, leaves it for Sterling.
[2300.20 - 2305.20] P:1784.30 E:0.280714 |  And from shore on the overlap, low ball whipped in, took a deflection, might just have hit the post.
[2305.20 - 2309.20] P:1868.53 E:0.308360 |  Goldkeeper got down at his near post area to make sure it was going wide.
[2309.20 - 2312.20] P:1667.53 E:0.242781 |  The net result of that is an England corner.
[2312.20 - 2319.20] P:1625.00 E:0.281431 |  But when England are moving the ball with pace and it was a save rather than the frame of the goal, they're looking really dangerous now.
[2319.20 - 2323.20] P:1717.73 E:0.266932 |  Much more dangerous than at any stage in the tournament today.
[2323.20 - 2332.20] P:1586.37 E:0.272600 |  This is the contrast with the two teams. England quick, offensive, got the pace, turn over a possession, they're straight at you.
[2332.20 - 2337.20] P:1548.88 E:0.309608 |  The checks build up a little bit slower, get into wide areas, balls in the box, numbers going in.
[2337.20 - 2346.20] P:1637.91 E:0.247075 |  Five to attack this Luke Shore corner, it's headed down and just couldn't quite be brought under control there by John Stones who has fallen.
[2346.20 - 2350.20] P:1614.87 E:0.283311 |  We've just seen the value of Carl Walker there, so it's quite incredible.
[2350.20 - 2355.20] P:1497.53 E:0.239846 |  You can leave him on his own corner one on one, his pace is fantastic.
[2357.20 - 2360.20] P:1409.44 E:0.177421 |  Pickford, playing it down for Walker.
[2360.20 - 2362.20] P:1401.74 E:0.164381 |  Walker back for Jordan, Pickford again.
[2362.20 - 2366.20] P:1235.28 E:0.194202 |  Pickford inside the penalty area.
[2366.20 - 2371.20] P:1421.85 E:0.240916 |  Just to reiterate what's going on in the game and Hamden Park, it's life here right now over on Talksport 2.
[2371.20 - 2375.20] P:1680.49 E:0.338341 |  Scotland trailing Croatia 1-0, really straggling the ball down and turning in the midfield.
[2375.20 - 2378.20] P:1765.43 E:0.274646 |  Kane playing it in, might break for Grealish.
[2378.20 - 2382.20] P:1847.41 E:0.266144 |  The defensive interception was important because it steered away from Sterling.
[2382.20 - 2386.20] P:1631.41 E:0.235303 |  It wasn't particularly convincing but it might have saved the goal.
[2386.20 - 2392.20] P:1435.52 E:0.272760 |  That was good play from Grealish, taking the ball on the turn in the midfield and able to glide forward effortlessly.
[2392.20 - 2394.20] P:1314.23 E:0.244310 |  How's that a balance about England going for?
[2394.20 - 2403.20] P:1548.43 E:0.260009 |  The interaction between the front falls fantastic, they've got energy, they've got legs and they're not just restricted to one position.
[2403.20 - 2409.20] P:1457.66 E:0.260544 |  There's a lot of interchange, makes it very difficult for the Czech midfield and back line to pick up.
[2409.20 - 2413.20] P:1335.09 E:0.269819 |  I've got to give a mention there, what a beautiful ball by Pickford picking out Grealish.
[2415.20 - 2418.20] P:1269.53 E:0.133204 |  Now the Czechs look long and it's clear.
[2419.20 - 2424.20] P:1445.80 E:0.252719 |  Harbour Phillips Schudder winning back in the midfield has done the heavy lifting there for Declan Rice.
[2424.20 - 2430.20] P:1797.41 E:0.316253 |  Rice is able to motor form these main 30-40 yards, rolls it into the path of Sakhar ahead of him.
[2430.20 - 2438.20] P:1789.93 E:0.275801 |  He's inside the area taking on Jankta, little step over, chips it towards the far post, look at the cane and it's cleared by Andrzej Szaluska.
[2438.20 - 2446.20] P:1729.47 E:0.278812 |  Only as far as Grealish, nice reverse ball, looking for Shaw, Shaw drives it in, hits the defender and bounces down this time for Kane.
[2446.20 - 2459.20] P:1539.53 E:0.233380 |  England a goal up, six minutes from half time, good value for it as well, notwithstanding the fact that Pickford has had to produce one excellent save from Hollis and Soček has come close as well.
[2460.20 - 2465.20] P:1503.09 E:0.269909 |  England hit the post inside the opening couple of minutes with Sterling who has himself scored.
[2465.20 - 2474.20] P:1462.66 E:0.280261 |  And if England win by one and Croatia win by one, which is the situation at the moment, will be England that win the group and the Czechs would finish second.
[2474.20 - 2478.20] P:1510.62 E:0.259865 |  Croatia would go through as one of the best third-place teams.
[2478.20 - 2484.20] P:1480.13 E:0.210951 |  Scotland for their part, need two unanswered goals with 50 minutes to go at Hamden Park.
[2484.20 - 2491.20] P:1353.86 E:0.229713 |  England with 40 minutes having elapsed here as well, leading by a golden hill. Declan Rice is in possession.
[2491.20 - 2504.20] P:1571.78 E:0.253823 |  This is an England side and every time that my eyes draw to this statistic on my piece of paper, I do feel as though I'm tempting fate, but it is an England side that have only conceded once in 14 hours and six minutes of play now.
[2504.20 - 2515.20] P:1440.26 E:0.225886 |  A Jacob Modder of Poland, the man that scored the goal. Every time I read that statistic out as well, Mark Saga shakes his head and berates me for tempting fate.
[2515.20 - 2517.20] P:1424.68 E:0.223754 |  Here's Declan Rice.
[2517.20 - 2524.20] P:1358.36 E:0.196815 |  Rice lays it back to his goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, controlling it on the edge of the six-yard box.
[2524.20 - 2531.20] P:1594.35 E:0.258088 |  Bring you a podcast to kickstart your day from Torch Sport as we nail the biggest talking points from Euro 2020 with punchy personality and opinion.
[2531.20 - 2540.20] P:1667.78 E:0.273111 |  All the biggest interviews from the managers and players that matter can download or listen to the Euro Daily Podcast or the Torch Sport app, or wherever you get your podcasts.
[2540.20 - 2549.20] P:1460.64 E:0.230349 |  All the reactions to England as Scotland tonight come in your way. First thing tomorrow, Cabin Phillips playing it out for Kyle Walker here for England.
[2549.20 - 2557.20] P:1708.03 E:0.288242 |  Looking to double their advantage before half-time. Walker takes it on inside the penalty area and wins the corner off the retreating yank top.
[2557.20 - 2567.20] P:1571.80 E:0.284092 |  England have got that commodity in their team that scares the opposition pace and it really is a major, major weapon for any team to have.
[2567.20 - 2578.20] P:1310.71 E:0.202118 |  Tyra Migs has just gone out to warm up over on the far touch line at the moment. It's going to be a corner that Cabin Phillips will take for England.
[2578.20 - 2580.20] P:1520.04 E:0.275349 |  It's their fifth corner of this first half.
[2581.20 - 2587.20] P:1442.38 E:0.257248 |  Our corners to set piece are such a feature of England at the last World Cup. Such a high proportion of England's goals came that way.
[2587.20 - 2596.20] P:1402.84 E:0.227140 |  Less so with lower quality delivery so far in this tournament. That one from Phillips headed away by Chaluska.
[2596.20 - 2602.20] P:1394.59 E:0.197664 |  Although England won the second ball and then the third Luke Shaw forced to go all the way back for Jordan Pickford.
[2602.20 - 2608.20] P:1647.07 E:0.263349 |  Three and a half minutes to go to half-time. England leading by Golden Hill. Now let's get the views of Sol Campbell.
[2608.20 - 2617.20] P:1431.35 E:0.292351 |  I think now it's all about maintaining and making sure we're kind of concentrated and make sure every time we get in a good position, let's make it pay.
[2617.20 - 2625.20] P:1351.67 E:0.292254 |  We don't want to get into fabulous positions and the ball goes away. So every time, let's get across, let's tackle, let's get to our once and I know.
[2625.20 - 2626.20] P:1593.09 E:0.223743 |  Just be relentless.
[2626.20 - 2631.20] P:1665.46 E:0.300065 |  England trying to bring it forward here with Jack Grealish. Grealish finding Kane inside the penalty area.
[2631.20 - 2634.20] P:1782.47 E:0.267499 |  Kane back onto his left foot. Loose getting effort.
[2634.20 - 2639.20] P:1717.36 E:0.287250 |  And in the offside flag came up. Sterling actually turned away. New's going to be flagged offside.
[2639.20 - 2645.20] P:1580.17 E:0.304245 |  Although it might have come back to him off the goalkeeper. He knew that there was nothing he could have done about that and it is a free kick.
[2645.20 - 2652.20] P:1567.29 E:0.249973 |  Although the ball did end up in the net with a spectacular long-range shot from distance. The flag was long since up.
[2652.20 - 2659.20] P:1705.41 E:0.258423 |  Well the good news for Scotland is that they have the first of the two they need. It's 1-1 at Hamden Park.
[2659.20 - 2670.20] P:1612.34 E:0.252185 |  McGregor with the equalising goal three minutes before half-time. Croatia 1, Scotland 1, which is live for you right now over on Talksport 2.
[2670.20 - 2677.20] P:1492.75 E:0.237407 |  And that's good news as far as Finland are concerned. It's just a little bit of hope for them and those booze you hear.
[2677.20 - 2684.20] P:1629.53 E:0.278767 |  Another confirmation of that Scotland equalising goal on the big screen here. So England 7, the Czechs 4, Croatia 2, Scotland 2.
[2684.20 - 2697.20] P:1401.70 E:0.194183 |  That's the situation in the group at the moment. And Finland would be given a reprieve as the side who currently have the fourth best record of the third place teams.
[2697.20 - 2705.20] P:1348.65 E:0.229980 |  That's why they're the ones on the knife edge tonight. But a positive result at Hamden Park and the winners will go through and Finland will be eliminated.
[2705.20 - 2714.20] P:1317.01 E:0.226648 |  1-1 there, 1-0 England lead in this one. And the Czechs work the ball for Louis Jankto, but it's well over here.
[2714.20 - 2718.20] P:1149.32 E:0.176865 |  Goes out of play for a goal kit that will be taken by Jordan Pickford away to the right-hand side.
[2718.20 - 2728.20] P:1627.12 E:0.219511 |  Speaking to a couple of Czech journalists before the game, they said that whilst the Czechs are good at denying the opposition shooting chances, they are prone to teams running at them.
[2728.20 - 2738.20] P:1521.65 E:0.245552 |  They do concede a lot of free kicks and we've seen England trying to capitalise on that. Obviously the same scouting reports have come England's way, the same evidence in front of their eyes.
[2738.20 - 2746.20] P:1664.47 E:0.232937 |  And they have taken the game to the Czechs whenever they can, trying to run particularly the two centre halves, Chalusko and Kalash.
[2746.20 - 2759.20] P:1491.44 E:0.246187 |  You're right, it's been a big trait of our team over recent years. Definitely we're a very athletic side, whether it be Rashford in the team or Sterling or Saka on this occasion.
[2759.20 - 2766.20] P:1379.21 E:0.210617 |  We certainly got players that can burst past people. Even Cole Walker is un-catchable once he's in full stride.
[2767.20 - 2779.20] P:1344.23 E:0.185284 |  Czech Realish has just been put on the deck this time by Sofal. Just takes in 10-15 seconds or so to get up, just adjusting his yellow right boot.
[2779.20 - 2790.20] P:1280.65 E:0.204790 |  He's okay. Harry Maguire will take the free kick for England with just got 20 seconds and maybe a minute of stoppage time to be added.
[2790.20 - 2800.20] P:1318.96 E:0.222256 |  A minute at most I would think. The fourth official, Sergian Javalevic has the numbers balled in his hand. We'll find out in a moment how long it will be.
[2800.20 - 2810.20] P:1548.93 E:0.276869 |  The ball not forward, Grealish back for Sterling. Sterling to Declan Rice, Rice on half way. He works it back inside his own half for Harry Maguire.
[2810.20 - 2817.20] P:1916.64 E:0.290889 |  Maguire fall for Declan Rice and the halftime whistle goes and that's England's best 45 minutes at the tournament by a street.
[2817.20 - 2827.20] P:1819.33 E:0.256630 |  Plenty of questions coming into tonight about England's performance. Plenty of individuals who had question marks hanging over their heads.
[2827.20 - 2832.20] P:1943.58 E:0.293171 |  And I think nearly every one of those has been answered in 45 minutes of excellent attacking play.
[2832.20 - 2839.20] P:1809.34 E:0.294522 |  England hitting the post in the opening couple of minutes, hitting the net 10 minutes later. Really good value for a halftime score of England won.
[2839.20 - 2851.20] P:1819.82 E:0.290294 |  The Czech Republic now. Well it's Jordan Henderson who is going to be coming on for England and Pereshevcik who will be marking his arrival for the Czech Republic.
[2851.20 - 2860.20] P:1825.91 E:0.304124 |  As far as Shevcik is concerned he has come on in both games so far for the Czechs. He came on against Croatia as a right winger and against Scotland as a 10.
[2860.20 - 2871.20] P:1606.28 E:0.262208 |  Jordan Henderson, obviously we know exactly where he is going to be featuring. Just waiting for confirmation as to who exactly is coming off for England.
[2871.20 - 2880.20] P:1777.29 E:0.272321 |  Declan is the one missing out there on the pitch at the moment. So almost a like for like positional play would you say, Jim?
[2880.20 - 2888.20] P:1738.13 E:0.292791 |  Well Rice is so integral isn't he to everything that England do. It makes sense with the situation in the group at the moment.
[2888.20 - 2896.20] P:1677.25 E:0.317424 |  That England can just give him 45 minutes off. I think it's really good to get maybe Henderson on.
[2896.20 - 2901.20] P:1490.19 E:0.328352 |  Like we spoke earlier about Maguire getting him again before the real heat about our knockout football.
[2901.20 - 2906.20] P:1584.68 E:0.311865 |  Also as well to have a look at Phillips playing in that deep line role like he does for Leeds.
[2907.20 - 2919.20] P:1717.31 E:0.293490 |  So Phillips will drop back into that slightly deeper role. Jordan Henderson coming on to play as an 8 for England and Shevcik is replaced by Jankto in the Czech Republic midfield.
[2919.20 - 2925.20] P:1941.81 E:0.291459 |  So those are the two changes. So England pick for the goal Walker-Stones, Maguire and Shaw.
[2926.20 - 2934.20] P:1986.30 E:0.296016 |  Henderson and Phillips, Saka Greenleys-Sterling and Kane up front. The Czechs, Václav Sváčilová, Sifal Čalůška, Kálaš Mbóžil,
[2934.20 - 2941.20] P:1792.80 E:0.247849 |  Páláš Šoček, Mazupus, Dárida and Shevcik and Šik up front.
[2941.20 - 2951.20] P:1542.25 E:0.290875 |  England in all white, kicking from left to right. Just waiting for the signal from Arta Días, the Portuguese referee to get the game back under way.
[2952.20 - 2962.20] P:1643.75 E:0.269951 |  Won the other England and if it stays that way for the next 45 minutes, England will have won the group with 7 points and maintain their unbeaten record.
[2962.20 - 2966.20] P:1399.42 E:0.255587 |  There will be a 17th home win in 19 games.
[2967.20 - 2974.20] P:1565.15 E:0.255210 |  Also guaranteed that England will be at Wembley in the round of 16 tie, which is all important.
[2974.20 - 2982.20] P:1582.93 E:0.287050 |  The runner-up of group F awaits if England would have won the group. That could be any of the teams in group F, Portugal, France, Germany or Hungary,
[2982.20 - 2992.20] P:1647.84 E:0.277801 |  all with the ability to finish second. We'll find out who it is together tomorrow night with the last games in that group kicking off at 8 o'clock on Talksport and Talksport 2.
[2992.20 - 3000.20] P:1613.03 E:0.277847 |  England are in early possession with Calvin, Felix, Valiant, Karl Walker. Walker will turn it back inside his own half of John Stones.
[3000.20 - 3007.20] P:1521.59 E:0.302952 |  Stones 10 yards outside his own penalty area goes back for Jordan Bifford. If you finish second in this group, you get the runners-up of group E,
[3007.20 - 3013.20] P:1692.26 E:0.275655 |  which is Spain's group, may well be Spain, Spain, Poland, Sweden or Slovakia.
[3013.20 - 3018.20] P:1411.63 E:0.260160 |  It will be one of the teams that will be facing the runner-up of this group.
[3018.20 - 3022.20] P:1517.05 E:0.264081 |  If you come third, you're probably going to get the Dutch in Budapest.
[3022.20 - 3029.20] P:1404.44 E:0.283303 |  Ball is out of play for a throw, which we've taken on the England right-hand side. It is one near to England at the start of the second half,
[3029.20 - 3034.20] P:1356.53 E:0.268360 |  one-one between Croatia and Scotland at Handen Park. Result of the suits, neither of them.
[3034.20 - 3042.20] P:1598.58 E:0.270627 |  Kane, back here for Jack Grealish. We're at least playing it forward. Kane's got it. Kane doing well to control it and then playing it through them in Phil for Luke Shaw.
[3043.20 - 3048.20] P:1751.33 E:0.272166 |  And Shaw can drive four to about 10 yards or so. Just pops it off at the feet of Raheem Sterling.
[3048.20 - 3054.20] P:1777.66 E:0.275319 |  No real brisk start to this second half for England as we've seen in the second half of the two previous games,
[3054.20 - 3060.20] P:1569.75 E:0.256490 |  where they've flown out of the traps. Haven't been able to do that quite so far today.
[3060.20 - 3066.20] P:1565.47 E:0.243413 |  Henderson exchanging passes with John Stones. Works it back for the Manchester City centre half on half way.
[3066.20 - 3073.20] P:1599.46 E:0.270033 |  He finds Harry Maguire, his good friend, and then Maguire. Finding Shaw Shaw will just play the direction that he's facing
[3073.20 - 3080.20] P:1670.58 E:0.283114 |  and so pokes it back towards the edge of his own penalty area where Maguire comes back and takes another touch, finds Jordan Pickford.
[3080.20 - 3085.20] P:1651.79 E:0.284848 |  England's most attacking players on half way and just trying to draw the Czech players out.
[3085.20 - 3091.20] P:1772.48 E:0.295435 |  Pickford in launching a four couldn't find an England player to flick it on. Now they turn forwards for the run from the substitute chef,
[3091.20 - 3096.20] P:1886.99 E:0.291974 |  but Stones saw him coming and comes across and clears it. He smacks it for the tip, Mazapust,
[3096.20 - 3102.20] P:1800.20 E:0.286440 |  and Calvin Phillips plays a horrible ball back for Kyle Walker, which is just drifting over the dead ball line
[3102.20 - 3105.20] P:1692.90 E:0.274333 |  and got out of play for a cheap Czech corner.
[3105.20 - 3113.20] P:1631.49 E:0.303329 |  We've just seen what we spoke about at half time, myself, Sol and Sags, about understanding the tempo of the game
[3113.20 - 3120.20] P:1503.91 E:0.309533 |  and your best means of defence is almost going forward. We had the perfect opportunity on the half way line there to play forward.
[3120.20 - 3126.20] P:1406.37 E:0.293830 |  We were slow, laboured, we ended up going back and now we've got a corner coming in our bot.
[3126.20 - 3137.20] P:1423.04 E:0.255192 |  As Corwin's Darada is going to stand over, have the option of taking it short into Boziel, but has waved him away.
[3137.20 - 3142.20] P:1762.43 E:0.295947 |  Instead he works short in towards the near post area for the runner that has come out and then as it was played back to him
[3142.20 - 3146.20] P:1869.89 E:0.315681 |  he drilled a low ball in which Pickford was able to easily clear.
[3146.20 - 3151.20] P:1696.23 E:0.260401 |  So coming together actually between him and Saka and he stayed down hurt,
[3151.20 - 3156.20] P:1544.03 E:0.286607 |  Pickford puts the ball out of play very sportingly so that he can receive whatever treatment is necessary.
[3156.20 - 3163.20] P:1708.81 E:0.273058 |  They have overplayed set pieces at times haven't they, and resisted the temptation to get decent balls inside the penalty area.
[3163.20 - 3169.20] P:1643.01 E:0.267113 |  That time Darada did get it in, but just got caught by Saka, a genuine collision between the pair of them.
[3169.20 - 3172.20] P:1413.95 E:0.271732 |  But he's okay, he's back on his feet without the need for treatment.
[3172.20 - 3179.20] P:1494.37 E:0.262165 |  Corwin, I thought the set up was really good, say popped out, back to Darada, but the ball was too short to him.
[3179.20 - 3187.20] P:1520.02 E:0.254597 |  I mean the set up was good, the movement was good, ball back to him too short and once again they don't get decent quality in the box and I'm pleased about that.
[3192.20 - 3194.20] P:1364.00 E:0.206730 |  Crowd finding their voice.
[3195.20 - 3200.20] P:1464.09 E:0.313959 |  Very encouraged by what they've seen so far on a glorious summer's night here at Wembley,
[3200.20 - 3203.20] P:1418.18 E:0.295081 |  albeit that it's still unseasonably cool.
[3203.20 - 3212.20] P:1396.10 E:0.213741 |  Shaw, Fanny Maguire, and again without wishing to tempt fate, England have had an assuredness about them,
[3212.20 - 3217.20] P:1401.90 E:0.287449 |  this familiar looking back for, albeit it is only the second time that they play together.
[3217.20 - 3225.20] P:1634.76 E:0.289425 |  It's only the second or first time actually that Luke Shaw has started successive games for England number, Garret Southgate.
[3225.20 - 3230.20] P:1843.75 E:0.293183 |  Kane has done really well, just chest it down, pops it back for Jordan Henderson who looks to supply him with a return ball.
[3230.20 - 3234.20] P:1793.21 E:0.295431 |  That would have been a brilliant one too, Kane on the stretch couldn't quite reach it,
[3234.20 - 3238.20] P:1602.35 E:0.274847 |  and the checks will keep it in right down by the corner flag and Boswell clears,
[3238.20 - 3244.20] P:1933.36 E:0.308174 |  Calvin Phillips chests it down and wins the seconds and then bulldozes his way towards the edge of the area, finds Kane,
[3244.20 - 3249.20] P:1842.24 E:0.283286 |  gets towards the byline, he's got support, he plays it back for Saka, first time balling from Henderson,
[3249.20 - 3254.20] P:1926.88 E:0.276912 |  little deflection on the cross, cleared out for Phillips who resists the temptation to shoot,
[3254.20 - 3259.20] P:1895.10 E:0.285105 |  recycles it instead by finding Shaw, little back heel flick from Sterling, didn't find Shaw,
[3259.20 - 3264.20] P:1711.96 E:0.288817 |  had to be cleared by Mazapus for an England throw, level the edge of the check, that'll be the area.
[3264.20 - 3270.20] P:1645.80 E:0.295471 |  I've got to say I'm pleased, Henderson has hit the ground running, he's been integral to everything we're doing at the moment,
[3270.20 - 3274.20] P:1619.22 E:0.295244 |  great interchange with Kane then, really good understanding between the two,
[3274.20 - 3280.20] P:1536.70 E:0.257259 |  and if you asked me before the game what would Gareth want, Shaw plays it forward towards the Sterling
[3280.20 - 3286.20] P:1549.76 E:0.285986 |  and might just have found himself caught offside, had the ball been played into his feet and the checks bring it away.
[3286.20 - 3294.20] P:1653.94 E:0.287636 |  What would we want before the game? You'd probably turn round and say everybody going into the second phase of this tournament,
[3294.20 - 3300.20] P:1493.29 E:0.277365 |  fully fit and firing, and the two question marks we had going into the tournament, McGuire and Henderson,
[3300.20 - 3306.20] P:1456.55 E:0.249090 |  McGuire hopefully getting 90 minutes and Henderson having a good 45 minutes,
[3306.20 - 3311.20] P:1455.98 E:0.273828 |  and all of a sudden we've got everyone fully fit and you know you can trust everyone if you pick them.
[3311.20 - 3319.20] P:1523.06 E:0.272520 |  And Henderson did come on for 45 minutes against Romania, but it's worth remembering he hasn't started a game for club or country
[3319.20 - 3326.20] P:1628.47 E:0.255572 |  since February the 20th because of his groin problems, that's four months that he hasn't been in a position to start a game.
[3326.20 - 3333.20] P:1387.39 E:0.213476 |  But I'm going to get a good 45 minutes under his belt tonight and he's looked sharp so far.
[3333.20 - 3340.20] P:1658.32 E:0.289308 |  Czech Republic nil, England one, you've heard from Stuart Pierce, now let's check in again with Sol Campbell for his early thoughts in this second half.
[3340.20 - 3348.20] P:1477.23 E:0.257530 |  I think we started okay, I think we just got to make sure we keep on probing, don't let the checks off the hook.
[3348.20 - 3352.20] P:1360.83 E:0.230889 |  Yes they're going to have possession, but we've got to keep on probing and keep on pushing.
[3354.20 - 3359.20] P:1415.27 E:0.250301 |  Sol Campbell, Stuart Pierce alongside me Jim Braff and Mark Sagar's in the chair.
[3359.20 - 3366.20] P:1429.67 E:0.291505 |  I'm just reminding all the reaction coming your way from the conclusion this game threw until 11 with our England correspondent Faye Carruthers,
[3366.20 - 3370.20] P:1618.94 E:0.301428 |  who will be speaking to Gareth Southgate and England's headline makers as well.
[3370.20 - 3378.20] P:1594.45 E:0.310760 |  Declan McCarthy are in stadium producer, he's won one in the other game, which is live for you right now between Croatia and Scotland on Talksfor 2.
[3378.20 - 3384.20] P:1732.40 E:0.305269 |  And the Czechs will be able to bring it forward here, so Czech has made an excellent advance run, ball played in just past him,
[3384.20 - 3391.20] P:1796.76 E:0.281119 |  and Sacher has had an excellent night showing his good awareness there dropping right back back inside his own penalty area.
[3391.20 - 3398.20] P:1616.18 E:0.255650 |  Just ahead of Kyle Walker, and able to block across as the Czechs got bodies forward, gambling by pushing the midfielders forward there.
[3398.20 - 3402.20] P:1670.97 E:0.275488 |  Sacher didn't shirk any defensive responsibility, and that's another big tick for him.
[3402.20 - 3409.20] P:1452.29 E:0.253546 |  Yeah, fantastic tracking back there, you can tell he's played in a deeper line role as well as in advanced area where he is at present.
[3412.20 - 3416.20] P:1412.38 E:0.225439 |  The Czechs have it again, over on the far touch line which is there, right.
[3416.20 - 3425.20] P:1657.13 E:0.288539 |  And now just exchange passes between the two defenders, they were winners of this competition when they were Czechoslovakia back in 1976.
[3425.20 - 3431.20] P:1391.64 E:0.249352 |  Ponenka scoring his famous penalty to make them European champions.
[3433.20 - 3441.20] P:1464.98 E:0.242251 |  And as the Czech Republic got to the final here at Wembley, the last time they played a tournament match on this ground when they were beaten by
[3441.20 - 3446.20] P:1360.72 E:0.253837 |  a beer off goal and goal by Germany in Euro 96.
[3448.20 - 3449.20] P:1293.17 E:0.237597 |  So close to being in England.
[3450.20 - 3459.20] P:1449.13 E:0.237345 |  Czech Republic final that year, it wasn't a big ball, he's over on the right hand touch line for the Czechs, chipped into space again inside the area where
[3459.20 - 3463.20] P:1592.58 E:0.298495 |  McGuire can just let it bounce and roll past him and it will go out of play.
[3464.20 - 3470.20] P:1486.47 E:0.302125 |  It looks as though another England change is imminent potentially, Marcus Rashford coming on for Harry Kane,
[3470.20 - 3473.20] P:1360.22 E:0.269780 |  unled to believe might not be too long in coming.
[3473.20 - 3480.20] P:1402.66 E:0.257324 |  It's 1-0 to England with 9 minutes gone in the second half here on TalkSport.
[3480.20 - 3486.20] P:1695.43 E:0.285412 |  And don't forget we bring you a podcast that kicks out your day, so now the biggest talking point from Euro 2020,
[3486.20 - 3489.20] P:1704.68 E:0.307862 |  all the biggest interviews from the managers and the players that matter.
[3489.20 - 3497.20] P:1578.05 E:0.238435 |  It's the Euro Daily podcast tomorrow coming your way on TalkSport app or wherever you get your podcasts.
[3497.20 - 3505.20] P:1467.91 E:0.228866 |  Get England trying to work it forward and it's a new and half in the crowd as the ball was played in Raheem Sterling's general direction with the Czechs able to mop up.
[3505.20 - 3514.20] P:1518.77 E:0.221259 |  And for all the positives and there have been plenty of them for England tonight, there have still only been five attempts in 55 minutes.
[3514.20 - 3518.20] P:1541.46 E:0.253433 |  I don't know whether that would be a source of concern for Gareth Southgate.
[3518.20 - 3522.20] P:1482.29 E:0.265840 |  And again it feels as though England have been well on top.
[3522.20 - 3526.20] P:1347.48 E:0.208834 |  On the other end the Czechs have only had one shot on target.
[3526.20 - 3533.20] P:1487.67 E:0.215871 |  Masipus will play it forward and he just want to throw there off Luxure on the Czech Republic right hand side.
[3533.20 - 3540.20] P:1573.33 E:0.246336 |  Yeah, I think it's probably the Scots game where we were hoping potentially to have more efforts at goal if you like
[3540.20 - 3543.20] P:1406.67 E:0.166375 |  and certainly more of course than we ended up with.
[3543.20 - 3551.20] P:1464.46 E:0.244617 |  That is for sure, but listen, at this stage we're over two and a half games into this tournament at the moment
[3551.20 - 3557.20] P:1431.96 E:0.266703 |  and the fact that we haven't conceded a goal and continuing that very good vein of form.
[3557.20 - 3562.20] P:1519.84 E:0.262791 |  I have no doubts at all that this team have got the ability to score goals.
[3562.20 - 3564.20] P:1494.33 E:0.272826 |  I have no doubts whatsoever.
[3564.20 - 3572.20] P:1447.24 E:0.252281 |  The one thing that might keep us away from going to the latter stages is how well we defend when it really, really matters.
[3572.20 - 3576.20] P:1500.05 E:0.218284 |  And these are all good tick box exercises I think.
[3576.20 - 3584.20] P:1603.53 E:0.241292 |  England have only got through the group stage of one major tournament in their history without conceding a goal.
[3584.20 - 3587.20] P:1422.40 E:0.187519 |  That was the 1966 World Cup.
[3587.20 - 3590.20] P:1501.79 E:0.298250 |  Oh Jim, I love your stats my friend.
[3590.20 - 3593.20] P:1427.08 E:0.293996 |  You've made me feel nice and warm glow about myself now.
[3593.20 - 3598.20] P:1736.30 E:0.299616 |  There was a nil nil in that one as well as Sags reminds me in the opening game against Uruguay
[3598.20 - 3604.20] P:1553.78 E:0.246853 |  and some diffident performances and critical reviews.
[3604.20 - 3606.20] P:1441.36 E:0.247821 |  It all ended up alright didn't it?
[3606.20 - 3611.20] P:1315.38 E:0.163586 |  That brings it back. Only this week doesn't it?
[3611.20 - 3614.20] P:1369.49 E:0.202027 |  Kallis, they want to play the ball forward here.
[3614.20 - 3619.20] P:1344.86 E:0.274332 |  Down the left hand side it'll work its way, away past Karl Walker and out for another throw
[3619.20 - 3622.20] P:1696.97 E:0.283929 |  which England will take in the right back position.
[3622.20 - 3625.20] P:1506.03 E:0.280014 |  11 minutes into the second half here on Talksport.
[3625.20 - 3631.20] P:1536.82 E:0.259948 |  The pace in the tempo that was there from both sides in the first 45 minutes has just dropped off a bit.
[3631.20 - 3635.20] P:1550.71 E:0.270314 |  There'll be a little bit of match and tournament management going on.
[3635.20 - 3641.20] P:1353.89 E:0.184388 |  We've seen that with the substitutions already.
[3641.20 - 3647.20] P:1405.60 E:0.249106 |  Both sides knowing that they're going through, knowing that the result of this one to some extent is academic.
[3647.20 - 3651.20] P:1602.37 E:0.268780 |  Jordan Pickford looked as though he was going to come outside his penalty area there
[3651.20 - 3656.20] P:1704.62 E:0.287917 |  and then correctly judged that it wasn't his to play and that Karl Walker will be able to take charge
[3656.20 - 3660.20] P:1846.97 E:0.282364 |  and he just looked like a cartoon character from I'm stuck on the edge of a cliff.
[3660.20 - 3664.20] P:1811.71 E:0.308954 |  Arms going out making sure that he didn't step off in the thin air.
[3664.20 - 3668.20] P:1553.80 E:0.270706 |  But he got back inside his penalty area and Walker shepherded the ball over the line anyway
[3668.20 - 3671.20] P:1567.38 E:0.218608 |  and had a play for a goal kick.
[3671.20 - 3674.20] P:1550.09 E:0.270683 |  As England have taken quickly, John Stones has got it.
[3674.20 - 3679.20] P:1250.61 E:0.195730 |  12th goal in the second half and it is 1-0 to England.
[3679.20 - 3682.20] P:1066.41 E:0.161523 |  Stones spawning McGuire.
[3682.20 - 3684.20] P:1515.92 E:0.225572 |  Play for by McGuire to Jack Grealish.
[3684.20 - 3689.20] P:1634.00 E:0.302190 |  Grealish hasn't really had the opportunity to try and take on any of the Czech players in the second half.
[3689.20 - 3693.20] P:1636.25 E:0.290344 |  He just showed the ball to Shevchik and nudged it past him
[3693.20 - 3699.20] P:1574.76 E:0.239210 |  and then after possession was turned over, Calvin Phillips came back and conceded a free kick.
[3699.20 - 3704.20] P:1507.11 E:0.264581 |  The standard of the refereeing is very good again and he's been really sensible again the referee tonight.
[3704.20 - 3706.20] P:1314.69 E:0.276092 |  He's pulled up on things that he's had to.
[3706.20 - 3709.20] P:1411.91 E:0.248645 |  He's not got Karl happy in any way, shape or form.
[3709.20 - 3715.20] P:1288.89 E:0.268431 |  He could have comfortably booked Phillips then to be quite honest with you and let things go.
[3715.20 - 3718.20] P:1278.60 E:0.252346 |  That's the one thing that England don't want.
[3718.20 - 3720.20] P:1663.28 E:0.335611 |  They don't want an accumulation of yellow cards.
[3720.20 - 3724.20] P:1400.64 E:0.299931 |  Phil Foghden the only player booked for England in the tournament so far
[3724.20 - 3730.20] P:1602.54 E:0.279342 |  and to make sure that he avoids a potential suspension, he's not in the matchday squad today.
[3730.20 - 3734.20] P:1431.23 E:0.235345 |  He's the only available player who isn't.
[3734.20 - 3738.20] P:1276.64 E:0.209092 |  The other two absentees are Mountain Chillwell
[3738.20 - 3743.20] P:1385.46 E:0.246079 |  and they will almost certainly be absent for the second round tie as well.
[3743.20 - 3747.20] P:1256.13 E:0.195240 |  They can't come out of isolation until the 28th of June.
[3747.20 - 3750.20] P:1390.56 E:0.185321 |  Stones after an England throw.
[3750.20 - 3752.20] P:1485.06 E:0.232829 |  Bagford's goalkeeper Pickford.
[3752.20 - 3755.20] P:1687.99 E:0.277363 |  Is it left footed? Still 1-1 at Hampton between Croatia and Scotland.
[3755.20 - 3759.20] P:1747.49 E:0.298629 |  Life here right now on two as they put what he's played for and the offside flag is up
[3759.20 - 3761.20] P:1697.43 E:0.252427 |  and it's a free kick to the Czechs.
[3761.20 - 3764.20] P:1417.12 E:0.197710 |  Level with the edge of the set of the circle.
[3764.20 - 3766.20] P:1817.10 E:0.284928 |  And the goal does change things.
[3766.20 - 3772.20] P:1365.68 E:0.221352 |  You have to remember that if England were to concede the Czechs would go top of the group.
[3772.20 - 3777.20] P:1190.59 E:0.224724 |  But as things stand in England who would win the group with seven points
[3777.20 - 3780.20] P:1402.47 E:0.262923 |  and would play here at Wembley next.
[3780.20 - 3783.20] P:1251.57 E:0.128242 |  On the 29th.
[3783.20 - 3788.20] P:1536.99 E:0.265948 |  Another change is imminent and it's the unmistakable figure of Alex Kral
[3788.20 - 3794.20] P:1387.78 E:0.273691 |  with the touch of the David Louise or sideshow Bob Abaddon who will be coming on very shortly.
[3794.20 - 3799.20] P:1345.11 E:0.234064 |  He's a defensive minded midfielder, May Wabi Holes who he replaces.
[3799.20 - 3805.20] P:1398.33 E:0.230284 |  Those two have been largely interchangeable for the Czechs in this tournament so far.
[3805.20 - 3808.20] P:1505.27 E:0.277514 |  Ball's gone out for another throw which will be taken by the Czechs.
[3808.20 - 3810.20] P:1431.18 E:0.276547 |  Dragmented at the moment, very stop-star.
[3810.20 - 3812.20] P:1505.12 E:0.305567 |  14 minutes into the second half.
[3812.20 - 3816.20] P:1569.63 E:0.300911 |  The Czechs work it back all the way back for their goalkeeper, Tomasz Vaslik.
[3816.20 - 3820.20] P:1633.65 E:0.297293 |  Vaslik takes a touch and just chips it down towards the left hand touch line.
[3820.20 - 3824.20] P:1512.54 E:0.297653 |  Bozil did get there and had a car walker and was able to knock it away.
[3824.20 - 3827.20] P:1555.44 E:0.322095 |  Bozil then brings it further forward, works it through the midfield
[3827.20 - 3830.20] P:1585.02 E:0.290177 |  and out towards the Czech Republic right hand side.
[3830.20 - 3833.20] P:1807.92 E:0.289825 |  Opportunity for Sofá to deliver outcomes, pick for punches, it clear.
[3833.20 - 3837.20] P:1767.23 E:0.303560 |  Seconds, one on the edge of the penalty area importantly by Jordan Henderson
[3837.20 - 3840.20] P:1772.60 E:0.311837 |  and he's just toe-bunding it forward. He's been able to find Harry Kane.
[3840.20 - 3846.20] P:1821.87 E:0.287577 |  Kane now with an opportunity to try and run at Cieluska who in the end is able to block him off.
[3846.20 - 3849.20] P:1711.72 E:0.311322 |  Halingl will win a throw midway inside the Czechs half.
[3849.20 - 3852.20] P:1670.74 E:0.266454 |  That was excellent striking blow there by Harry Kane.
[3852.20 - 3856.20] P:1344.81 E:0.273821 |  No options around him, able to hold it up for a long time and win a throw.
[3856.20 - 3861.20] P:1465.78 E:0.262682 |  First cross we've had there of this guy and Pickford elected to punch.
[3861.20 - 3865.20] P:1401.00 E:0.211451 |  I think it was probably on to catch him on being quarter on his way up
[3865.20 - 3869.20] P:1364.31 E:0.161177 |  He cleared the box with a punch, so credit to him.
[3869.20 - 3871.20] P:1376.44 E:0.199638 |  Stones plays it forward here for Henderson.
[3871.20 - 3877.20] P:1749.06 E:0.274073 |  Saka is a lovely turn, got the better of Bozil, that'll be a yellow card and a suspension.
[3877.20 - 3881.20] P:1714.62 E:0.290590 |  And the left back is going to be out of their round of 16 tie.
[3881.20 - 3884.20] P:1797.69 E:0.266755 |  That's his second yellow card of the tournament.
[3884.20 - 3887.20] P:1699.62 E:0.242412 |  It's a brilliant turn by Bacchio Saka.
[3887.20 - 3894.20] P:1663.14 E:0.304253 |  I mentioned early in the game that Saka had Bozil on toast when the two met at club level in the Europa League back in early April.
[3894.20 - 3897.20] P:1328.75 E:0.259351 |  And Saka far too good for him there.
[3897.20 - 3904.20] P:1566.41 E:0.312675 |  That's a big yellow card as far as the Czechs are concerned, as Bozil will miss the round of 16 tie through suspension.
[3904.20 - 3909.20] P:1365.30 E:0.332791 |  I think he'll be pleased to see the back of Saka both for club and country.
[3912.20 - 3916.20] P:1489.10 E:0.325234 |  When he couldn't quite turn quickly enough to see the back of him there, that was the problem.
[3916.20 - 3919.20] P:1491.60 E:0.330976 |  Saka stands over this free kick.
[3919.20 - 3921.20] P:1629.97 E:0.331738 |  The Czechs are keeping a high line.
[3921.20 - 3924.20] P:1756.45 E:0.326524 |  A couple yards outside the box, England making runs inside the area.
[3924.20 - 3932.20] P:1766.56 E:0.298833 |  It's nodding in and away and out of play for a corner that the assistant referee flags near side.
[3932.20 - 3934.20] P:1742.39 E:0.284296 |  And the offside flag is up.
[3934.20 - 3942.20] P:1452.82 E:0.245937 |  And it's a free kick, which will be taken by the Croatians about 13-14 yards from their dead ball line.
[3942.20 - 3948.20] P:1510.37 E:0.263254 |  Well Scotland needed a goal to get themselves ahead and keep their Euro hopes alive.
[3948.20 - 3950.20] P:1757.23 E:0.285557 |  But they have just conceded.
[3950.20 - 3958.20] P:1676.11 E:0.259758 |  Luca Modric giving Croatia a 2-1 lead at Hamden Park, rasping drive from just inside the D.
[3958.20 - 3962.20] P:1781.21 E:0.291818 |  Flying past David Marshall, brilliantly hit with the outside of the right boot.
[3962.20 - 3969.20] P:1697.22 E:0.258552 |  Croatia 2, Scotland 1 at Hamden Park and the Scots are going out and Finland are going out as well.
[3969.20 - 3978.20] P:1657.97 E:0.255005 |  As things stand because of that goal and Croatia would go through in third place with the Scots as they are there and here.
[3978.20 - 3984.20] P:1624.73 E:0.269741 |  It looked like a handball by Grealish and the referee agrees as he was trying to get away from Holash.
[3987.20 - 3990.20] P:1265.87 E:0.172540 |  And the Czechs take it quickly, working out towards the right hand side.
[3990.20 - 3992.20] P:1558.09 E:0.243306 |  Still trailing by a goal.
[3992.20 - 3995.20] P:1800.38 E:0.303882 |  Holash has come closer than anybody for the Czechs to scoring.
[3995.20 - 3997.20] P:1493.05 E:0.186842 |  The fourth to the next save out of Pickford.
[3997.20 - 4001.20] P:1714.63 E:0.253454 |  Back for Socek who had one effort drift just wide in the first half.
[4001.20 - 4004.20] P:1713.19 E:0.277378 |  Socek with a nice angle ball out for Sofal.
[4004.20 - 4010.20] P:1532.10 E:0.209280 |  Two players who are club teammates in the Czech Republic as well as now in East London.
[4012.20 - 4015.20] P:1760.35 E:0.320042 |  Holash went back to his feet as he goes down on the edge of the penalty area.
[4015.20 - 4021.20] P:1720.40 E:0.318564 |  In England they were able to bring it forward as the England fans told about the news from Hamden Park.
[4022.20 - 4025.20] P:1740.98 E:0.262154 |  Shevchik, Holash still not back on his feet.
[4025.20 - 4030.20] P:1573.74 E:0.272579 |  Sterling just making masopas the way that they've got to play it down injured.
[4030.20 - 4036.20] P:1549.34 E:0.292512 |  And now Daredo will put it out so that Holash can receive whatever treatment is necessary.
[4036.20 - 4037.20] P:1759.62 E:0.324165 |  18 goal in the second half.
[4037.20 - 4038.20] P:1686.75 E:0.307350 |  Czech Republic nil.
[4038.20 - 4041.20] P:1570.86 E:0.279070 |  England won't get the views of Stuart Pierce in a moment.
[4041.20 - 4045.20] P:1533.01 E:0.300348 |  But Sol Campbell are you still happy with the way things are going with less than half an hour to go?
[4045.20 - 4047.20] P:1372.69 E:0.287942 |  I think now it's all about maintaining.
[4047.20 - 4055.20] P:1274.31 E:0.276285 |  You know sometimes when the game is a bit bitty, it's all about keeping your concentration, maintaining your quality wherever you do.
[4055.20 - 4064.20] P:1311.54 E:0.295058 |  This is times when you've got to really kind of maintain that football ability, that concentration, the mental side and pick the right moment to kind of get another goal.
[4066.20 - 4069.20] P:1530.99 E:0.290594 |  Double change is going to be made by the Czechs.
[4069.20 - 4075.20] P:1592.79 E:0.290887 |  Daredo is the first player who's coming off and Alex Krall is on for him.
[4075.20 - 4081.20] P:1641.28 E:0.326408 |  And they're also going to bring on one of the hottest young striking properties in continental football.
[4081.20 - 4085.20] P:1730.01 E:0.297566 |  Adam Haložek just 18 years of age.
[4085.20 - 4094.20] P:1572.32 E:0.272126 |  He scored 15 goals in 19 league games this season for Sparta Prad, which is a decent enough return at any stage of your career.
[4094.20 - 4096.20] P:1623.23 E:0.294056 |  Let alone right at the start of it.
[4096.20 - 4099.20] P:1705.87 E:0.295461 |  And Klozek is on for masopas.
[4099.20 - 4102.20] P:1394.79 E:0.334246 |  Now whether that means that they go two up top.
[4103.20 - 4109.20] P:1558.31 E:0.241293 |  Whether they'll play Klozek just off-chick, it looks as though that is what they're going to do.
[4109.20 - 4116.20] P:1523.52 E:0.293539 |  He will drift out towards the left-hand side and Krall is going to play in an advanced role almost as a 10.
[4116.20 - 4119.20] P:1630.14 E:0.292278 |  Czechs deciding that they're going to have to try and go for it.
[4120.20 - 4126.20] P:1626.56 E:0.295626 |  Klozek scored four goals inside the only half hour or so of his last league match.
[4127.20 - 4130.20] P:1432.00 E:0.333257 |  And it'll be interesting to see how he fares here.
[4130.20 - 4135.20] P:1531.28 E:0.296053 |  He has come off the bench in the first two games of the tournament and gets 25 minutes tonight.
[4135.20 - 4142.20] P:1399.48 E:0.266428 |  One-nil England lead, the second half in which chances have been at a premium at either end.
[4142.20 - 4145.20] P:1474.38 E:0.265533 |  Croatia 2, Scotland 1, the score on Handen.
[4145.20 - 4149.20] P:1386.20 E:0.265254 |  And they will finish third in the group as things stand right now. England would win it.
[4149.20 - 4153.20] P:1403.43 E:0.310085 |  Ball goes out to the Czech Republic right where it's played for.
[4153.20 - 4158.20] P:1638.17 E:0.306792 |  Krall has just caught Calvin Phillips as the two-web for the aerial challenge
[4158.20 - 4164.20] P:1649.47 E:0.287181 |  and it's an England free kick and Marcus Rashford is now getting ready in Jubilungum as well.
[4164.20 - 4169.20] P:1383.99 E:0.307291 |  An England 17-year-old is going to be brought on in a moment.
[4169.20 - 4173.20] P:1465.81 E:0.299392 |  And that will be England's second and third changes.
[4173.20 - 4175.20] P:1640.56 E:0.337680 |  Harry Maguire stepping up from the defensive line.
[4175.20 - 4178.20] P:1531.63 E:0.287143 |  He can't quite find Sackle with the well-intentioned ball.
[4178.20 - 4181.20] P:1383.02 E:0.279384 |  He got the angle right but just stepping forward onto it.
[4181.20 - 4183.20] P:1456.33 E:0.329526 |  Bolsheviks was able to get it away.
[4183.20 - 4186.20] P:1559.73 E:0.299978 |  Back it goes for John Stones inside the England half.
[4186.20 - 4188.20] P:1514.59 E:0.248097 |  And now Sackle.
[4188.20 - 4190.20] P:1468.78 E:0.328135 |  And he can bring it forward.
[4190.20 - 4193.20] P:1590.62 E:0.308118 |  And there's a real buzz of expectation goes around Wembley whenever he picks up possession.
[4193.20 - 4197.20] P:1786.29 E:0.306674 |  Greenish goes wide to the England left hand side and Sterling has been fouled.
[4197.20 - 4202.20] P:1664.21 E:0.310915 |  And it's a free kick which will be taken in a promising position for England after the foul by Saffar.
[4202.20 - 4204.20] P:1620.93 E:0.264324 |  Sure appears.
[4204.20 - 4210.20] P:1474.73 E:0.292575 |  Yeah, the game sort of meandered along a little bit with that too much action in either 18-yard books
[4210.20 - 4215.20] P:1513.03 E:0.299551 |  in England that suits us better than the Czechs as we're winning the game at the moment.
[4215.20 - 4221.20] P:1388.49 E:0.304501 |  So just I'd be more than happy with a second goal just to calm the nerves down
[4221.20 - 4226.20] P:1332.37 E:0.295950 |  and probably just underline our superiority I think.
[4226.20 - 4228.20] P:1345.02 E:0.330039 |  I think we can hang on here.
[4228.20 - 4233.20] P:1624.19 E:0.319863 |  It will be only a sixth win in the last 18 matches at major tournaments
[4233.20 - 4237.20] P:1472.22 E:0.279214 |  since they beat Ukraine back in Euro 2012.
[4237.20 - 4245.20] P:1534.36 E:0.296662 |  The Wales, Tunisia, Panama, Sweden and Croatia in this tournament during that time.
[4245.20 - 4248.20] P:1773.16 E:0.314343 |  England poised to make the double change.
[4248.20 - 4251.20] P:1911.14 E:0.330195 |  And Raheem Sterling is the first player that's coming off.
[4251.20 - 4258.20] P:1806.61 E:0.300620 |  He leaves behind the goal and gets a big ovation from the England supporters all around this stadium.
[4258.20 - 4261.20] P:1647.21 E:0.318961 |  And he'll be replaced by Marcus Rashford.
[4261.20 - 4264.20] P:1812.89 E:0.317278 |  And the other change is going to see Jack Greenish withdrawn.
[4264.20 - 4267.20] P:1763.89 E:0.274377 |  And Jude Bellingham will come on to replace him.
[4267.20 - 4271.20] P:1783.62 E:0.235590 |  So Bellingham and Rashford for Greenish and Sterling.
[4271.20 - 4275.20] P:1649.97 E:0.263868 |  Double change for England midway through the second half.
[4275.20 - 4281.20] P:1609.08 E:0.322051 |  Yeah, I think Gareth's got the opportunity here to look at one or two.
[4281.20 - 4283.20] P:1756.12 E:0.345266 |  I think Greenish has had a decent evening.
[4283.20 - 4286.20] P:1663.23 E:0.329570 |  Certainly Sterling has getting that goal.
[4286.20 - 4288.20] P:1590.43 E:0.303473 |  They've come out with credit.
[4288.20 - 4290.20] P:1644.47 E:0.326232 |  A lot's been thought about.
[4290.20 - 4293.20] P:1632.14 E:0.297827 |  Rashford needs to come to the party a little bit just struggling for a bit of form.
[4293.20 - 4298.20] P:1557.71 E:0.328289 |  And Bellingham, I think there's one or two, have got high hopes for him.
[4298.20 - 4300.20] P:1770.83 E:0.360168 |  Ball inside the penalty area from the free kick.
[4300.20 - 4303.20] P:1849.13 E:0.308033 |  It looked as though Harry Maguire was wrestled to the ground.
[4303.20 - 4306.20] P:1799.77 E:0.274913 |  Referee and the officials didn't agree.
[4306.20 - 4308.20] P:1529.35 E:0.246746 |  Whether the VAR will be having a look at it.
[4308.20 - 4310.20] P:1860.68 E:0.315133 |  No notification on our screens yet.
[4310.20 - 4311.20] P:1848.19 E:0.323596 |  The bad is the case.
[4311.20 - 4314.20] P:1733.68 E:0.293443 |  Stones has gone back for Kyle Walker.
[4314.20 - 4316.20] P:1743.99 E:0.268240 |  Walker now finds Jude Bellingham.
[4316.20 - 4320.20] P:1467.70 E:0.257189 |  Still a week or so short of his 18th birthday.
[4320.20 - 4327.20] P:1350.15 E:0.282121 |  Bellingham picking it up and bangling a 60-yard ball all the way back to his goalkeeper Jordan Pigford.
[4327.20 - 4335.20] P:1493.06 E:0.277030 |  Interesting that whilst changes are being made, still no sign of Jayden Sancho as yet.
[4335.20 - 4342.20] P:1373.21 E:0.292686 |  I think what you've got to understand, Jim, is Gareth and his coaching staff work with these players day in, day out.
[4342.20 - 4345.20] P:1268.25 E:0.284666 |  And it's important that you understand that.
[4345.20 - 4349.20] P:1390.55 E:0.291708 |  You don't see whether they think players are showing good form in training.
[4349.20 - 4352.20] P:1589.80 E:0.287186 |  Whether they can handle the occasion if they can.
[4352.20 - 4356.20] P:1395.65 E:0.268725 |  You pick up little detail if you like in training.
[4356.20 - 4358.20] P:1559.60 E:0.294048 |  And that will influence player selection.
[4358.20 - 4362.20] P:1537.26 E:0.240104 |  Of course, here's Phillips playing it for now for Bellingham.
[4362.20 - 4365.20] P:1492.47 E:0.321749 |  Good moving off the ball from the Borussia Dortmund player.
[4365.20 - 4369.20] P:1503.51 E:0.245791 |  Knocked away through the midfield though by the Czechs.
[4369.20 - 4372.20] P:1124.85 E:0.175734 |  They have it at the back.
[4373.20 - 4376.20] P:1075.52 E:0.165160 |  That's a foul in the free kick.
[4379.20 - 4381.20] P:1214.93 E:0.239159 |  20 yards inside their own half.
[4381.20 - 4384.20] P:1458.25 E:0.283940 |  An opportunity to try and get it forward quickly.
[4384.20 - 4387.20] P:1455.84 E:0.319134 |  No tempers afraid in that match at Hamden Park.
[4387.20 - 4390.20] P:1695.65 E:0.348006 |  Scotland is still trailing Croatia by two goals to one.
[4390.20 - 4396.20] P:1562.89 E:0.318409 |  They need two goals in the last 20 minutes there to keep their tournament hopes alive.
[4396.20 - 4398.20] P:1402.92 E:0.323630 |  Otherwise they would be going out.
[4398.20 - 4401.20] P:1389.63 E:0.277412 |  If they score one, they could yet take Croatia out.
[4402.20 - 4409.20] P:1536.98 E:0.236608 |  So Czech is dropping in a little bit deeper now on the right hand side of the midfield.
[4409.20 - 4414.20] P:1473.36 E:0.209760 |  For the Czechs, almost playing as a right-hand set of half.
[4414.20 - 4417.20] P:1391.01 E:0.179051 |  Ball played down to Boszil.
[4417.20 - 4419.20] P:1156.53 E:0.142932 |  Left back making his way forward.
[4419.20 - 4422.20] P:1642.73 E:0.292522 |  In he goes to the feet of Sevchik in the midfield for the Czechs.
[4422.20 - 4424.20] P:1757.02 E:0.272980 |  He's just chipped it forward.
[4424.20 - 4426.20] P:1457.55 E:0.269176 |  Luke Schors there to knock it away.
[4426.20 - 4428.20] P:1575.74 E:0.294223 |  Now he played down the left hand side for Rashford.
[4428.20 - 4430.20] P:1699.02 E:0.313053 |  Rashford with a good step over.
[4430.20 - 4433.20] P:1773.40 E:0.277143 |  Excellent challenge to win it back though from Sevchik.
[4433.20 - 4437.20] P:1482.93 E:0.241728 |  And Kral will be able to win it back in his blue boots.
[4437.20 - 4439.20] P:1798.88 E:0.325089 |  Try and turn it away from Bellingham.
[4439.20 - 4441.20] P:1717.64 E:0.209752 |  But just turn the wrong way.
[4441.20 - 4446.20] P:1528.94 E:0.262723 |  Ends up putting it straight out of play for a throw that will be taken on the England left-hand side.
[4446.20 - 4447.20] P:1558.70 E:0.260432 |  20 to go.
[4447.20 - 4450.20] P:1492.19 E:0.274576 |  England 20 minutes away from winning this group without conceiving the goal.
[4450.20 - 4456.20] P:1522.62 E:0.282398 |  Just looking at our central midfield area where Henderson coming back and getting 45 minutes of football.
[4456.20 - 4462.20] P:1451.74 E:0.231217 |  Philips dropping back into that holding slot that Royce has vacated.
[4462.20 - 4466.20] P:1608.29 E:0.257810 |  It will be interesting there will be one or two selection problems in that area.
[4466.20 - 4468.20] P:1503.60 E:0.279705 |  It's almost two from three now.
[4470.20 - 4477.20] P:1321.15 E:0.210323 |  That certainly will be an interesting subject line of debate going into the next game.
[4477.20 - 4480.20] P:1372.13 E:0.267801 |  If everybody's fit, what's the best combination?
[4480.20 - 4483.20] P:1380.58 E:0.253518 |  Not necessarily the two best players.
[4483.20 - 4487.20] P:1360.76 E:0.250785 |  What's the best pairing in there for England?
[4487.20 - 4488.20] P:1363.23 E:0.184876 |  Here's John Stones.
[4488.20 - 4493.20] P:1403.01 E:0.301936 |  That might be something that you want to have your say on with the boys on the sports bar tonight.
[4493.20 - 4497.20] P:1782.76 E:0.334907 |  When we finish here at Wembley at 11, Jason and Andy taking your calls on Torch.
[4497.20 - 4500.20] P:1579.50 E:0.332641 |  Spawn now at 717-223-24.
[4500.20 - 4501.20] P:1576.37 E:0.336051 |  You can get your calls in.
[4501.20 - 4505.20] P:1564.69 E:0.285760 |  How do you say on national radio from 11 o'clock tonight?
[4505.20 - 4511.20] P:1540.18 E:0.283989 |  The ball is played over the top and chased towards the edge of the penalty area by Saka.
[4511.20 - 4513.20] P:1486.71 E:0.204098 |  Coming out to pick it up.
[4513.20 - 4517.20] P:1376.94 E:0.255545 |  It will be very comfortably claimed by goalkeeper Thomas Fastling.
[4517.20 - 4518.20] P:1728.28 E:0.298039 |  71 gone.
[4518.20 - 4519.20] P:1787.61 E:0.235222 |  Checks nil.
[4519.20 - 4521.20] P:1337.44 E:0.245158 |  England 1 here on Torch Sport.
[4523.20 - 4528.20] P:1355.80 E:0.262685 |  What we haven't done this second half and that was one of the few balls played over the top.
[4528.20 - 4533.20] P:1361.60 E:0.251393 |  We've not done that to turn them around to stretch them a little bit.
[4533.20 - 4537.20] P:1585.20 E:0.263738 |  But I think in the run of the game we've been quite happy.
[4537.20 - 4541.20] P:1684.18 E:0.310124 |  The same balls that were coming in our box seem to have dried up a little bit, haven't they?
[4541.20 - 4547.20] P:1448.81 E:0.251126 |  In the second half which is looked like their best route of potentially scoring, I think.
[4547.20 - 4551.20] P:1508.23 E:0.229049 |  Similar kind of second half performance that England have shown tonight.
[4551.20 - 4553.20] P:1660.13 E:0.310847 |  That they put up against Croatia really.
[4553.20 - 4556.20] P:1681.89 E:0.264861 |  Well they just try to starve the opposition of possession.
[4556.20 - 4559.20] P:1582.57 E:0.255234 |  If you look at the second half statistics,
[4559.20 - 4563.20] P:1513.46 E:0.201920 |  Shots none for either side.
[4563.20 - 4565.20] P:1395.48 E:0.219164 |  Only 27 minutes in.
[4565.20 - 4569.20] P:1262.15 E:0.233525 |  I tell you who's played well tonight without catching the eye.
[4569.20 - 4570.20] P:1190.66 E:0.244076 |  Cole Walker.
[4570.20 - 4572.20] P:1416.99 E:0.242374 |  He's done everything sensibly.
[4572.20 - 4575.20] P:1439.95 E:0.271324 |  He's been pretty decent with his passing.
[4575.20 - 4577.20] P:1522.48 E:0.279264 |  He's cleared up things that the far post.
[4577.20 - 4579.20] P:1737.44 E:0.202743 |  He's just been...
[4579.20 - 4585.20] P:1555.53 E:0.225799 |  Sometimes you see an air of panic in his play on occasion.
[4585.20 - 4588.20] P:1490.74 E:0.199931 |  Tonight he's been a consummate professional I think.
[4589.20 - 4592.20] P:1478.47 E:0.263607 |  McGuire heads the ball down here for deformation.
[4592.20 - 4595.20] P:1523.44 E:0.235899 |  Cole Walker back to his club teammate John Stones.
[4595.20 - 4597.20] P:1396.21 E:0.186004 |  Stones looking out.
[4597.20 - 4600.20] P:1490.45 E:0.306970 |  Rashford made an early darting running from the left-hand side.
[4600.20 - 4603.20] P:1517.99 E:0.234099 |  But Stones resisted the temptation to try and find him.
[4603.20 - 4605.20] P:1532.93 E:0.282774 |  Rashford playing out on the left.
[4605.20 - 4608.20] P:1513.13 E:0.288513 |  Sacker on the right came through the middle of the moment for England.
[4608.20 - 4610.20] P:1348.82 E:0.257454 |  Bellingham making a good third man run for from midfield.
[4610.20 - 4612.20] P:1612.19 E:0.302165 |  Back it goes for Henderson.
[4612.20 - 4617.20] P:1302.47 E:0.270599 |  The defensive linchpin of this midfield alongside Calvin Phillips.
[4617.20 - 4620.20] P:1354.41 E:0.299018 |  A double pivot in there again in this second half.
[4620.20 - 4622.20] P:1505.43 E:0.278613 |  Stones now comes forward.
[4622.20 - 4624.20] P:1608.05 E:0.287468 |  Takes on the first, check player.
[4624.20 - 4626.20] P:1715.06 E:0.296439 |  And the second loose ball might break for Kane.
[4626.20 - 4630.20] P:1357.42 E:0.242302 |  But it's just knocked away and cleared further down the left-hand side
[4630.20 - 4633.20] P:1667.40 E:0.296921 |  by the centre half, Cowash of Bristol City.
[4633.20 - 4636.20] P:1493.95 E:0.295525 |  Player who only made a couple of Premier League appearances
[4636.20 - 4639.20] P:1518.91 E:0.272321 |  but more than 200 in the championship behind him.
[4639.20 - 4641.20] P:1454.36 E:0.292959 |  Bristol City and for Middles were as well.
[4641.20 - 4643.20] P:1349.42 E:0.217647 |  Bellingham back for Henderson.
[4643.20 - 4645.20] P:1326.63 E:0.257519 |  Henderson now to Harry McGuire.
[4645.20 - 4648.20] P:1697.53 E:0.297510 |  And it's McGuire's turn this time to make his way forward.
[4648.20 - 4650.20] P:1676.48 E:0.276936 |  And get towards the edge of the area.
[4650.20 - 4652.20] P:1805.16 E:0.333265 |  And almost slipping in for Belly.
[4652.20 - 4654.20] P:1803.33 E:0.306808 |  And Hollish came back and knocks it away.
[4654.20 - 4656.20] P:1741.99 E:0.317226 |  And England have their first corner of the second half.
[4656.20 - 4658.20] P:1700.94 E:0.242879 |  73 gone.
[4658.20 - 4660.20] P:1499.56 E:0.230937 |  And it's still one the other England.
[4660.20 - 4665.20] P:1549.66 E:0.280106 |  I think England are playing a real air of professionalism now, if you like.
[4665.20 - 4667.20] P:1340.87 E:0.275094 |  You know, we're mopping things up.
[4667.20 - 4670.20] P:1521.18 E:0.289490 |  Potential counter attacks or build-up play from the checks
[4670.20 - 4673.20] P:1536.86 E:0.267209 |  are being snuffed out comfortably in their half
[4673.20 - 4675.20] P:1356.88 E:0.289484 |  or just inside their own half.
[4675.20 - 4680.20] P:1320.35 E:0.203503 |  We're dominating the play but, once again, goals tick-take games.
[4680.20 - 4684.20] P:1653.49 E:0.302306 |  Stones has made a very late run in here to join the contingent
[4684.20 - 4687.20] P:1469.85 E:0.275191 |  perhaps another poor England set-piece delivery.
[4687.20 - 4690.20] P:1602.96 E:0.280880 |  Luke Shaw hitting the first man at the near post.
[4690.20 - 4694.20] P:1616.86 E:0.271108 |  It's clear but only as far as the England back line.
[4694.20 - 4696.20] P:1561.55 E:0.237459 |  Sacher dropped back in there, found Phillips.
[4696.20 - 4699.20] P:1606.88 E:0.257683 |  Phillips worked it forward, not a good effect.
[4699.20 - 4703.20] P:1329.22 E:0.214141 |  He's able to mop up again but in a slightly deeper position.
[4703.20 - 4705.20] P:1338.21 E:0.224295 |  Now Walker's got it.
[4705.20 - 4707.20] P:1795.04 E:0.278212 |  Walker playing it forward.
[4707.20 - 4710.20] P:1576.83 E:0.238302 |  Stones controls it with his right instep.
[4710.20 - 4714.20] P:1484.02 E:0.248264 |  The second touch became a tackle and it was knocked away from him by Sofael.
[4714.20 - 4718.20] P:1604.83 E:0.247142 |  And now breaking forward at the left hand touch line, his Flauzeck.
[4718.20 - 4720.20] P:1806.79 E:0.254646 |  And the young substitute is able to find Kral.
[4720.20 - 4723.20] P:1822.63 E:0.293497 |  Kral gets towards the barline, whips it in and hits Walker
[4723.20 - 4725.20] P:1565.45 E:0.251109 |  and goes out of play for a corner.
[4725.20 - 4728.20] P:1346.64 E:0.270359 |  Yeah, first time for a little while that the checks have been
[4728.20 - 4732.20] P:1295.30 E:0.297927 |  up and around our L box and they got the opportunity here to whip a corner in.
[4732.20 - 4736.20] P:1536.20 E:0.279308 |  Just going back to England's last corner and once again Luke Shaw
[4736.20 - 4738.20] P:1450.22 E:0.286326 |  failing to beat the first man.
[4738.20 - 4739.20] P:1146.00 E:0.294748 |  Really poor corner.
[4739.20 - 4743.20] P:1249.06 E:0.254999 |  It's something that we hopefully we can improve on as we go through the tournament.
[4744.20 - 4748.20] P:1657.15 E:0.274419 |  Well the checks are going to make a change before the corner is taken.
[4748.20 - 4754.20] P:1640.69 E:0.303998 |  Shick is off and Thomas Peckhardt who was on the books of Tottenham and Southampton
[4754.20 - 4758.20] P:1527.00 E:0.310222 |  early in his career is the man that has come on to replace him.
[4758.20 - 4763.20] P:1654.75 E:0.306304 |  So England have been able to keep the tournament's joint leading score of very quiet tonight.
[4763.20 - 4765.20] P:1843.09 E:0.243868 |  Shick's hardly had a sniff.
[4765.20 - 4768.20] P:1324.51 E:0.211581 |  Peckhardt that little bit taller.
[4768.20 - 4773.20] P:1628.87 E:0.263465 |  And the player who was in prolific form is the top score in the Polish League this season
[4773.20 - 4776.20] P:1403.54 E:0.239918 |  with 22 in 25 games.
[4776.20 - 4781.20] P:1416.37 E:0.268712 |  That's earned him an international recall after more than seven years out of the picture.
[4781.20 - 4786.20] P:1547.89 E:0.245228 |  And Peckhardt is on for his first major tournament experience.
[4786.20 - 4787.20] P:1818.82 E:0.216129 |  15 to go.
[4787.20 - 4790.20] P:1742.16 E:0.287349 |  It's 1-0 England but they've got a corner to defend.
[4790.20 - 4794.20] P:1730.70 E:0.268155 |  And Peckhardt is a prolific aerial target to attack this.
[4794.20 - 4797.20] P:1925.31 E:0.303388 |  Swung inside the six yard box and headed away.
[4797.20 - 4798.20] P:1915.98 E:0.299579 |  Stones there first.
[4798.20 - 4800.20] P:1537.02 E:0.198475 |  And that was a good piece of defending.
[4800.20 - 4805.20] P:1446.61 E:0.220125 |  Goes out for a throw which Shevchik is told to leave.
[4806.20 - 4809.20] P:1297.93 E:0.157542 |  Mazapust will come across.
[4811.20 - 4812.20] P:1235.74 E:0.190770 |  Nice bozela beg your pardon.
[4812.20 - 4814.20] P:1335.26 E:0.171474 |  Takes it short.
[4814.20 - 4815.20] P:1792.15 E:0.242131 |  Back into the feet of Shevchik.
[4815.20 - 4820.20] P:1608.87 E:0.261466 |  Another high ball angled inside the penalty area but Pickford can watch that one go.
[4820.20 - 4825.20] P:1540.29 E:0.254100 |  And it hits the red holdings behind the goal which is in front of our England correspondent Faker Robertson.
[4825.20 - 4827.20] P:1179.15 E:0.274673 |  Goes out of play for a goal kick.
[4827.20 - 4831.20] P:1714.03 E:0.292193 |  So on Campbell England's match management has been excellent in this second half.
[4831.20 - 4836.20] P:1573.86 E:0.280359 |  Nothing going forward but they have denied a side chase in the game a single shot of no.
[4836.20 - 4838.20] P:1093.63 E:0.251019 |  Yeah and that's been professional as well.
[4838.20 - 4840.20] P:954.01 E:0.296104 |  You know, regardless of what's going on in front of you,
[4840.20 - 4844.20] P:1314.25 E:0.299364 |  the Czechs have had possession but England have cut to the bay.
[4844.20 - 4845.20] P:1357.45 E:0.315283 |  They've snuffed out everything.
[4845.20 - 4846.20] P:1328.44 E:0.331160 |  All their kind of moves.
[4846.20 - 4851.20] P:1291.57 E:0.327866 |  Look at that last ball going out for a throw in for a goal kick.
[4851.20 - 4852.20] P:1415.07 E:0.262743 |  So it's good.
[4852.20 - 4853.20] P:1336.62 E:0.277160 |  We've learned in how.
[4853.20 - 4855.20] P:1236.30 E:0.327815 |  We're managing the game.
[4856.20 - 4861.20] P:1415.70 E:0.276058 |  Harry Maguire playing the ball down towards Luke Shaw on the England left hand side.
[4861.20 - 4866.20] P:1568.06 E:0.250501 |  The last time these two sides met the Czechs did strike late in the game.
[4866.20 - 4870.20] P:1498.61 E:0.225503 |  There was a debut goal from Andrasiek.
[4870.20 - 4874.20] P:1412.20 E:0.210066 |  Came off the bench and won it for the Czechs 2-1.
[4875.20 - 4877.20] P:1255.18 E:0.216402 |  That'd been one-one inside the opening 10 minutes that day.
[4877.20 - 4885.20] P:1523.31 E:0.287050 |  One of the winged in after 12 tonight and more than an hour after that they still have that advantage against there now.
[4885.20 - 4887.20] P:1495.99 E:0.317578 |  Henderson playing it down for Karl Walker.
[4887.20 - 4895.20] P:1405.42 E:0.268940 |  Walker's put under pressure by Klozhek and goes back for Jordan Pickford who just opens up the left-in step together the way.
[4895.20 - 4897.20] P:1643.64 E:0.312236 |  Klozhek falls over the head of Harry Kane on half way.
[4897.20 - 4903.20] P:1644.02 E:0.297352 |  Kane then wins it and was caught by Kallash and the referee said that there's nothing under water with that.
[4903.20 - 4906.20] P:1589.43 E:0.258600 |  It's just a racing accident between the two players.
[4906.20 - 4907.20] P:1528.02 E:0.260689 |  Kane's back on his feet.
[4907.20 - 4913.20] P:1432.38 E:0.273383 |  There's an half given the assistant referee a dirty look and we'll give Kallash one at a moment as well.
[4913.20 - 4914.20] P:1024.01 E:0.177096 |  Play goes on.
[4914.20 - 4919.20] P:1249.91 E:0.186750 |  Čaluska bringing the ball forward finding Sočak.
[4919.20 - 4920.20] P:1599.66 E:0.291838 |  Sočak inside the centre-serve.
[4920.20 - 4927.20] P:1452.17 E:0.297611 |  Wonderful range of passing on him that we're now so familiar with and Karl Walker climbs high and nods it away from Božel.
[4927.20 - 4928.20] P:1650.69 E:0.305048 |  Out of play for a Czech throw.
[4928.20 - 4930.20] P:1676.57 E:0.304352 |  There's England ready Tyrone Mings.
[4930.20 - 4933.20] P:1601.50 E:0.289745 |  He will be coming on very shortly.
[4935.20 - 4937.20] P:1826.32 E:0.357532 |  He's just getting his final instructions.
[4938.20 - 4944.20] P:1587.52 E:0.331296 |  And that roar that you've heard is used in a third Croatia goal.
[4945.20 - 4946.20] P:1575.82 E:0.340992 |  The Scots are going out.
[4946.20 - 4949.20] P:1509.80 E:0.327713 |  Croatia three, Scotland one.
[4950.20 - 4955.20] P:1763.35 E:0.321196 |  That just has a few ramifications incidentally as far as the Czechs are concerned.
[4955.20 - 4957.20] P:1385.34 E:0.344897 |  Which more in a moment.
[4957.20 - 4959.20] P:1635.49 E:0.332263 |  But Tyrone Mings coming on here for John Stoves.
[4960.20 - 4963.20] P:1512.74 E:0.333140 |  Yeah, it gives another cap to Tyrone Mings.
[4963.20 - 4969.20] P:1462.24 E:0.320872 |  He'll be pleased to get back on the pitch and just have a little get-in pairing him up with McGuire.
[4969.20 - 4978.20] P:1338.38 E:0.288041 |  And it's another tick box I think, you know, in regard to what comes ahead and the options that Garev potentially might have in games.
[4980.20 - 4985.20] P:1638.42 E:0.320117 |  McGuire's moved to the right of the two centre halves here with Mings playing in his favourite position on the left.
[4987.20 - 4989.20] P:1338.45 E:0.244830 |  Eleven minutes to go.
[4989.20 - 4990.20] P:1527.63 E:0.266688 |  Czechs nil.
[4990.20 - 4991.20] P:1220.87 E:0.275455 |  England one.
[4992.20 - 4996.20] P:1365.58 E:0.301119 |  Sak are able to bring the ball forward and it goes out of play for a throw and will be taken by Jordan Henderson.
[4996.20 - 4999.20] P:1269.86 E:0.234935 |  Yeah, as I say, you know, Mings pairing him up.
[4999.20 - 5002.20] P:1403.66 E:0.294272 |  What you want as many options as you possibly can.
[5002.20 - 5008.20] P:1437.10 E:0.310073 |  I swapped text with Gareth early in the week and I said your team selection is going to be absolutely vital now.
[5008.20 - 5014.20] P:1295.09 E:0.312140 |  And you know, coming out of the Scotland game there was one or two question marks, Ivorals and whatever.
[5014.20 - 5016.20] P:1185.90 E:0.286356 |  And I think he's got that right once again.
[5016.20 - 5024.20] P:1367.99 E:0.271465 |  I've got to say in his substitutions and what they throw up as well in the game going forward have been really important.
[5025.20 - 5031.20] P:1440.93 E:0.272803 |  Walker with a long aerial switcher play out towards Luke Shaw on the England left-hand side.
[5032.20 - 5033.20] P:1564.01 E:0.260855 |  Back for Calvin Phillips.
[5035.20 - 5037.20] P:1147.17 E:0.242606 |  Philips to McGuire. Playful by McGuire.
[5037.20 - 5038.20] P:1420.74 E:0.239210 |  A little step over from Jordan Henderson.
[5038.20 - 5040.20] P:1187.03 E:0.293995 |  Now Carl Walker can bring the ball forward.
[5040.20 - 5043.20] P:1575.25 E:0.314882 |  He works through the midfield in towards the feet of Jude Bellingham.
[5043.20 - 5046.20] P:1575.61 E:0.302769 |  It's still one middle of England here on Torxport.
[5046.20 - 5048.20] P:1715.34 E:0.302145 |  Three-one Croatia lead Scotland.
[5048.20 - 5049.20] P:1602.17 E:0.226774 |  Scots are heading out.
[5049.20 - 5050.20] P:1821.84 E:0.317765 |  Croatia are going through.
[5050.20 - 5053.20] P:1772.19 E:0.306004 |  Finland will be eliminated as a result of that as well.
[5055.20 - 5060.20] P:1378.17 E:0.174757 |  Now as things stand, Croatia leading three-one.
[5060.20 - 5066.20] P:1524.02 E:0.247545 |  It's a three-goal swing as far as they're concerned with the Czechs.
[5066.20 - 5072.20] P:1458.46 E:0.221077 |  And they've also scored two more, three more than the Czechs.
[5072.20 - 5077.20] P:1565.93 E:0.263779 |  And that means that Croatia are now second in the group and the Czechs are down to third.
[5077.20 - 5078.20] P:1788.95 E:0.329776 |  I mean they will still be going through.
[5078.20 - 5079.20] P:1109.13 E:0.196764 |  It's so close.
[5079.20 - 5083.20] P:1386.69 E:0.239913 |  He talked about my crib sheet earlier.
[5083.20 - 5087.20] P:1553.77 E:0.274647 |  I've got about 20 different lines and combinations of things that can happen.
[5087.20 - 5090.20] P:1437.28 E:0.285884 |  You've been waiting for this moment all night, haven't you?
[5090.20 - 5095.20] P:1554.79 E:0.298947 |  All I've learned is that I've prepped it in a format that isn't up to purpose.
[5095.20 - 5096.20] P:1500.50 E:0.260992 |  It's too complicated a workout.
[5096.20 - 5097.20] P:1670.54 E:0.352270 |  What's going on?
[5097.20 - 5100.20] P:1368.61 E:0.240232 |  Even though I've got it all written in front of me.
[5100.20 - 5103.20] P:1443.50 E:0.230163 |  So where would that send the Czechs now then?
[5103.20 - 5104.20] P:1555.66 E:0.327498 |  England at the top of the group.
[5104.20 - 5105.20] P:1383.43 E:0.248257 |  That's all you need to know.
[5105.20 - 5106.20] P:1395.50 E:0.313148 |  Okay, all right.
[5106.20 - 5113.20] P:1396.96 E:0.251418 |  I think that the Czechs are third and that they would be facing the Netherlands in Budapest.
[5113.20 - 5116.20] P:1541.06 E:0.253048 |  Because there's a three-goal swing in terms of goal difference.
[5116.20 - 5121.20] P:1499.74 E:0.255361 |  And Croatia have scored three goals more than the Czechs.
[5121.20 - 5124.20] P:1506.18 E:0.242640 |  So Croatia second in the group and the Czechs third.
[5124.20 - 5126.20] P:1574.48 E:0.245759 |  That's the thing that stands at the moment.
[5126.20 - 5129.20] P:1604.60 E:0.301552 |  That means that it would be Croatia who would be playing the runners-up of Group E.
[5129.20 - 5132.20] P:1495.35 E:0.313563 |  That's going to be Spain, Poland, Sweden or Slovakia.
[5132.20 - 5134.20] P:1135.93 E:0.229757 |  And England.
[5134.20 - 5136.20] P:1269.28 E:0.237180 |  And we'll be playing the runners-up of Group F.
[5136.20 - 5139.20] P:1624.26 E:0.308928 |  So that would be Portugal, France, Germany or Hungary.
[5139.20 - 5142.20] P:1568.28 E:0.275625 |  Here at Wembley on the 29th.
[5142.20 - 5145.20] P:1395.37 E:0.242506 |  That's a week tonight.
[5145.20 - 5147.20] P:1503.00 E:0.278681 |  One goal for the Czechs here.
[5147.20 - 5149.20] P:1285.87 E:0.215677 |  They may go top of the group.
[5149.20 - 5154.20] P:1422.86 E:0.225835 |  England would be second and Croatia would go back down to third.
[5154.20 - 5156.20] P:1306.80 E:0.161009 |  Here's Saka.
[5156.20 - 5159.20] P:1388.61 E:0.198280 |  Saka with a chance to drive forward.
[5159.20 - 5163.20] P:1373.24 E:0.201243 |  Just flick it out towards the England right-hand side for Henderson.
[5163.20 - 5165.20] P:1254.63 E:0.228760 |  Henderson back for Walker.
[5165.20 - 5167.20] P:1371.51 E:0.151621 |  Walker to Phillips.
[5167.20 - 5169.20] P:1147.97 E:0.240173 |  Back for Walker again.
[5169.20 - 5171.20] P:1296.39 E:0.295531 |  Walker goes back inside his own half for Harry Maguire.
[5171.20 - 5173.20] P:1348.80 E:0.244654 |  Maguire to Tyrone Mings.
[5173.20 - 5175.20] P:1295.77 E:0.249706 |  There's eight minutes to go.
[5175.20 - 5177.20] P:980.75 E:0.093310 |  Czechs nil. England one.
[5177.20 - 5181.20] P:1238.43 E:0.227599 |  The ball driven down towards the England right-hand side for Jordan Henderson.
[5181.20 - 5183.20] P:1241.22 E:0.275775 |  He's easily headed away.
[5183.20 - 5185.20] P:1704.87 E:0.270999 |  Klozak has it now.
[5185.20 - 5188.20] P:1539.86 E:0.246253 |  Socek put under immediate pressure in the midfield by Phillips.
[5188.20 - 5191.20] P:1241.72 E:0.185283 |  Phillips can't win the ball back.
[5191.20 - 5194.20] P:1498.15 E:0.263510 |  The Czech will just flick it out towards the left-hand side for Jan Bozil.
[5194.20 - 5196.20] P:1493.25 E:0.287434 |  Bozil chipping it forward on the outside of the right.
[5196.20 - 5201.20] P:1562.74 E:0.288853 |  Kral will give chase and Maguire will turn it back for his goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.
[5201.20 - 5204.20] P:1625.60 E:0.305890 |  Pickford to put under pressure by Peckhardt and got it away.
[5204.20 - 5207.20] P:1835.23 E:0.293030 |  It's headed back towards the end to the penalty area by the Czechs here.
[5207.20 - 5209.20] P:1856.79 E:0.286181 |  Now an opportunity for Socek.
[5209.20 - 5211.20] P:1847.32 E:0.290807 |  Socek drilled it Peckhardt who shot to the deflection.
[5211.20 - 5213.20] P:1686.41 E:0.280346 |  No deflection.
[5213.20 - 5215.20] P:1698.76 E:0.276686 |  He's just shanked it straight wide.
[5215.20 - 5217.20] P:1562.82 E:0.268688 |  One nil to England.
[5217.20 - 5219.20] P:1374.95 E:0.211912 |  Seven to go.
[5219.20 - 5226.20] P:1516.70 E:0.271338 |  The ball there was Pickford and ended up scalping one to Socek to Kufail.
[5226.20 - 5229.20] P:1676.34 E:0.280843 |  From there the attack was built up.
[5229.20 - 5234.20] P:1846.76 E:0.326614 |  There's going to be a big ovation here for Bakayo Saka who will leave the field.
[5234.20 - 5237.20] P:1806.89 E:0.278275 |  And that's England's final change.
[5237.20 - 5240.20] P:1913.89 E:0.340263 |  He can be mightily pleased with his night's work.
[5240.20 - 5242.20] P:1884.07 E:0.288360 |  He has been superb.
[5242.20 - 5244.20] P:1822.06 E:0.306983 |  Played a major part in the goal.
[5244.20 - 5248.20] P:1792.14 E:0.330540 |  Hasn't looked at all out of place on his tournament debut as a 19-year-old.
[5248.20 - 5253.20] P:1837.11 E:0.308877 |  He's a player with a burgeoning reputation and he's enhanced it even further tonight.
[5253.20 - 5256.20] P:1799.38 E:0.299435 |  And a big roar for this man who comes on to replace him.
[5256.20 - 5260.20] P:1826.54 E:0.281839 |  Jaten Sancho playing in Euro 2020 for the first time.
[5260.20 - 5265.20] P:1619.30 E:0.291278 |  Yeah, Sancho will be pleased to get on the pitch but when you talk about individuals,
[5265.20 - 5271.20] P:1478.19 E:0.339823 |  I think Saka's performance in obviously the same position has been outstanding this evening.
[5271.20 - 5273.20] P:1150.23 E:0.339167 |  Very, very good.
[5274.20 - 5276.20] P:1738.75 E:0.338321 |  The Czechs have made their final change as well.
[5276.20 - 5282.20] P:1758.44 E:0.279951 |  Hollis coming off and Matty Videra Bernley who came off the bench for the final 20 minutes against Scotland
[5282.20 - 5285.20] P:1652.88 E:0.239633 |  gets what, six minutes tonight.
[5285.20 - 5287.20] P:1280.91 E:0.222243 |  So another body upfield.
[5287.20 - 5290.20] P:1459.91 E:0.206359 |  Croatia 3, Scotland 1.
[5290.20 - 5292.20] P:1509.51 E:0.296145 |  Scotland going to be eliminated.
[5292.20 - 5295.20] P:1668.35 E:0.258964 |  England are going to win the group as things stand.
[5295.20 - 5297.20] P:1652.87 E:0.252987 |  Second place, we've got a Croatia.
[5297.20 - 5300.20] P:1777.63 E:0.280771 |  And third to the Czechs with the scores as they are at the moment.
[5300.20 - 5302.20] P:1752.74 E:0.268181 |  Tom Campbell part of our commentary team tonight.
[5302.20 - 5308.20] P:1699.17 E:0.249091 |  Assault, I'm just going to ask you in a couple of minutes for a couple of pieces of constructive criticism for England.
[5308.20 - 5314.20] P:1656.61 E:0.262038 |  It has been a good night, the scoreline all important, the performance has been so much further north
[5314.20 - 5318.20] P:1727.41 E:0.288423 |  of what we've seen really over the course of the tournament so far.
[5318.20 - 5321.20] P:1627.02 E:0.260504 |  Just in a minute, I'll come to you for any constructive criticism,
[5321.20 - 5327.20] P:1701.65 E:0.271002 |  anything you think that England still need to improve upon over the lockout stages.
[5327.20 - 5331.20] P:1454.89 E:0.268900 |  I think obviously we'd love to get some more shots and targets.
[5331.20 - 5335.20] P:1416.37 E:0.296124 |  We want to be in and around their box and causing the Czechs problems.
[5335.20 - 5339.20] P:1391.99 E:0.277254 |  But overall, it's been a fantastic performance by everybody.
[5339.20 - 5343.20] P:1492.64 E:0.279114 |  Everybody's kind of done their business and done it professionally. It's good.
[5343.20 - 5347.20] P:1513.18 E:0.238348 |  England take a throw, the Czechs are making a part in the take a throw quickly.
[5347.20 - 5350.20] P:1690.82 E:0.301321 |  Looking for Socek, now Kral will be able to bring it forward.
[5350.20 - 5353.20] P:1696.36 E:0.278060 |  And Rashford has come back and tracked him.
[5353.20 - 5355.20] P:1556.13 E:0.254148 |  It's done well to put his foot in.
[5355.20 - 5358.20] P:1606.88 E:0.270703 |  Hays it back for Tyrone Mings. Mings now to Shaw.
[5358.20 - 5360.20] P:1574.20 E:0.319360 |  Now with five minutes to go, Luke Shaw can bring it forward.
[5360.20 - 5363.20] P:1671.80 E:0.310002 |  Rides the sliding challenge that comes in on him.
[5363.20 - 5367.20] P:1711.76 E:0.323904 |  England have got Jaten Sancho in space on the right and Rashford has played him in here.
[5367.20 - 5369.20] P:1618.32 E:0.339295 |  England leading 1-0 but hungry for more.
[5369.20 - 5371.20] P:1851.33 E:0.317880 |  Sancho right-hand side of the area finds Rashford.
[5371.20 - 5376.20] P:1792.62 E:0.264275 |  Rashford takes it on and has beaten his man and pulls it back.
[5376.20 - 5378.20] P:1855.69 E:0.329127 |  Just away from the on-rushing Jordan Henderson.
[5378.20 - 5384.20] P:1813.92 E:0.312888 |  Mike gets a second opportunity and he's threatening in for two.
[5384.20 - 5391.20] P:1641.13 E:0.270852 |  His first international goal but the flag is up.
[5391.20 - 5393.20] P:1472.24 E:0.345790 |  For celebrations we're only new tonight.
[5393.20 - 5397.20] P:1770.14 E:0.317382 |  I think maybe he appreciated that perhaps he was offside.
[5397.20 - 5401.20] P:1634.62 E:0.304387 |  But the flag is up against Jordan Henderson and it remains at 1.
[5401.20 - 5405.20] P:1614.27 E:0.277203 |  It looked like a Czech player played that ball.
[5405.20 - 5411.20] P:1344.86 E:0.181497 |  I'll be interested to see when they look.
[5411.20 - 5415.20] P:1200.05 E:0.200836 |  No, I think it was Bellingham who poked it forward.
[5415.20 - 5418.20] P:1152.98 E:0.192373 |  I thought it was a backward pass for a moment.
[5418.20 - 5419.20] P:1080.32 E:0.254670 |  Oh, I'll tell you what.
[5419.20 - 5421.20] P:1364.60 E:0.268739 |  They're going to have a look at it obviously.
[5421.20 - 5426.20] P:1552.54 E:0.287762 |  It's Bellingham and Shevchik have both tried to play the ball at the same time.
[5426.20 - 5428.20] P:1596.67 E:0.247893 |  Now who got the touch?
[5428.20 - 5430.20] P:1608.90 E:0.310457 |  I think it is Bellingham actually.
[5430.20 - 5434.20] P:1613.97 E:0.319822 |  From that angle the previous one that we saw was inconclusive at best.
[5434.20 - 5438.20] P:1805.41 E:0.289120 |  No doubt that Henderson was in an offside position if it was Bellingham that had played the ball
[5438.20 - 5440.20] P:1576.21 E:0.224463 |  and that is the verdict.
[5440.20 - 5442.20] P:1504.34 E:0.271209 |  Now as a consequence the goal doesn't stand in.
[5442.20 - 5448.20] P:1408.92 E:0.221467 |  Jordan Henderson still waits for his first goal for his country.
[5448.20 - 5453.20] P:1474.56 E:0.312608 |  Probably a little bit unfair of me to mention it at this time but he has now made more appearances
[5453.20 - 5457.20] P:1446.88 E:0.338809 |  without scoring for England than any other midfielder in their history.
[5457.20 - 5461.20] P:1213.39 E:0.339064 |  This is his 60th game for his country tonight.
[5461.20 - 5464.20] P:1142.70 E:0.329374 |  Three minutes to go.
[5464.20 - 5467.20] P:1104.80 E:0.318914 |  Czech Republic 0, England 1.
[5467.20 - 5472.20] P:1577.00 E:0.322730 |  Jordan Henderson coming on tonight has now played in three different European championships.
[5472.20 - 5476.20] P:1728.50 E:0.276227 |  He featured a couple of times in Euro 2012 when he replaced the Inter Frank Lampard
[5476.20 - 5478.20] P:1737.68 E:0.300751 |  before the tournament started.
[5478.20 - 5484.20] P:1673.05 E:0.288326 |  One game in 2016 and home for his first in Euro 2020 in 21.
[5484.20 - 5485.20] P:1918.29 E:0.289109 |  87 on the clock.
[5485.20 - 5490.20] P:1423.81 E:0.219208 |  Czech Republic 0, England 1 and Croatia 3.
[5490.20 - 5492.20] P:1325.55 E:0.249866 |  Scotland 1 in the other game in the group.
[5492.20 - 5499.20] P:1401.49 E:0.282889 |  I'm a little bit surprised that Henderson has not scored more goals or any goals really in his international career
[5499.20 - 5502.20] P:1346.55 E:0.254405 |  because he's got good energy to get from box to box.
[5502.20 - 5509.20] P:1301.48 E:0.239807 |  He's got decent technique striking the ball and he's got the credentials to be a goal scorer.
[5513.20 - 5518.20] P:1521.27 E:0.299946 |  Tyrone Mings with a free kick for England hit long into the north London night sky.
[5518.20 - 5523.20] P:1556.91 E:0.307173 |  Henderson's away from Harry Kane and then he's brought down on the right hand side of the midfield by Jaden Sanchez.
[5523.20 - 5528.20] P:1526.48 E:0.304685 |  Henderson's done really well with the ball in his feet and a very tight corridor on the right hand touch sign.
[5528.20 - 5531.20] P:1516.98 E:0.288249 |  Just a flick it back round the corner, drag it back.
[5531.20 - 5535.20] P:1683.43 E:0.276752 |  England able to then to bring it forward and find a Phillips Phillips to short.
[5535.20 - 5537.20] P:1707.71 E:0.324771 |  Short continuing his run little give and go.
[5537.20 - 5539.20] P:1811.13 E:0.322855 |  Still short goes and he's brought down.
[5539.20 - 5544.20] P:1740.58 E:0.306207 |  No advantage in the referee in fact as Wave short back up to his feet.
[5545.20 - 5551.20] P:1568.77 E:0.332564 |  Well he was much much closer than me but I'm very surprised that he didn't give a free kick England's way there.
[5551.20 - 5555.20] P:1678.92 E:0.259175 |  Pickford clearing his lines left footed from the edge of the six-yard box.
[5555.20 - 5556.20] P:1577.36 E:0.259650 |  High ball forward.
[5556.20 - 5562.20] P:1555.94 E:0.226576 |  Still England haven't had a shot to save in this second half as yet.
[5562.20 - 5565.20] P:1560.58 E:0.260797 |  90 seconds of normal time to go.
[5566.20 - 5568.20] P:1266.73 E:0.162953 |  That plus stoppage time.
[5568.20 - 5575.20] P:1480.32 E:0.271733 |  That's all that England have to successfully navigate to get out of the group as group winners without having conceded a goal.
[5575.20 - 5582.20] P:1355.12 E:0.249430 |  Well I think it's been a very workman like performance, some good performances within that.
[5582.20 - 5587.20] P:1524.22 E:0.249140 |  Fingers crossed another clean sheet takes some doing at international level.
[5587.20 - 5590.20] P:1331.30 E:0.246444 |  Three clean sheets on the pop.
[5593.20 - 5595.20] P:1382.16 E:0.192740 |  Long ball fall from Pickford.
[5596.20 - 5598.20] P:1411.16 E:0.232449 |  Harry Kane able to head it on.
[5598.20 - 5604.20] P:1398.89 E:0.250670 |  Out of way for Marcus Rashford out of play for a throw which will be taken on the check right hand side.
[5604.20 - 5606.20] P:1494.06 E:0.276964 |  Salt we're in the 90th minute.
[5606.20 - 5607.20] P:1293.68 E:0.308756 |  England nearly there.
[5607.20 - 5608.20] P:1382.64 E:0.261663 |  Almost there.
[5608.20 - 5611.20] P:1451.99 E:0.239022 |  It's just nice to kind of now we're almost there.
[5611.20 - 5614.20] P:1488.26 E:0.254070 |  I think just really maintaining really.
[5614.20 - 5615.20] P:1468.09 E:0.339648 |  Don't do anything silly.
[5615.20 - 5617.20] P:1506.36 E:0.313931 |  Let's see if we can nick a goal here.
[5617.20 - 5619.20] P:1758.23 E:0.336277 |  Opportunity to bring it forward.
[5619.20 - 5620.20] P:1710.65 E:0.285216 |  And Joe is waiting.
[5620.20 - 5625.20] P:1702.10 E:0.254835 |  It was a final header away by Kallash as he was played into him by Rashford.
[5625.20 - 5626.20] P:1560.38 E:0.211817 |  Nick Shaw wins the seconds.
[5626.20 - 5628.20] P:1465.15 E:0.313652 |  He's worked it back for Mingz.
[5628.20 - 5633.20] P:1615.18 E:0.295089 |  So Mingz had to take a touch because initially his route back to Jordan Pickford in the sanctuary was blocked off.
[5633.20 - 5640.20] P:1523.93 E:0.269759 |  But he was able to guide it back effectively enough in the end and England will just bring it forward with McGuire.
[5640.20 - 5643.20] P:1450.64 E:0.252463 |  McGuire to Mingz back for Pickford again.
[5644.20 - 5648.20] P:1416.52 E:0.170805 |  And cleared long by Jordan Pickford.
[5651.20 - 5653.20] P:1358.58 E:0.151949 |  Checks mop up.
[5653.20 - 5654.20] P:1514.96 E:0.221846 |  Go back to their goalkeeper.
[5654.20 - 5656.20] P:1594.26 E:0.209254 |  Three minutes of stoppage time.
[5656.20 - 5661.20] P:1469.18 E:0.187956 |  Checks will finish third in this group as things stand at the moment.
[5661.20 - 5665.20] P:1549.50 E:0.342573 |  As I say, it's most likely they'll face the Netherlands in Budapest.
[5665.20 - 5667.20] P:1543.07 E:0.315657 |  Poland beat Sweden tomorrow.
[5667.20 - 5671.20] P:1424.25 E:0.245136 |  They could well be the winners of Spain's group in Glasgow.
[5671.20 - 5674.20] P:1289.82 E:0.169706 |  Which is their next appointment.
[5674.20 - 5677.20] P:1557.96 E:0.258433 |  Which if that's not Spain, actually isn't too bad a draw.
[5677.20 - 5679.20] P:1134.93 E:0.242366 |  Ball is over on the right-hand side.
[5679.20 - 5681.20] P:1643.98 E:0.261036 |  Spain with only two points in their two games so far.
[5681.20 - 5684.20] P:1645.61 E:0.269515 |  We'll find out how they get on tomorrow.
[5684.20 - 5692.20] P:1606.19 E:0.275136 |  They kick off at five o'clock as the action continues on the Torx Sport and Torx Sport 2 in the Euro.
[5692.20 - 5693.20] P:1712.29 E:0.322969 |  Spain taking on Slovakia.
[5693.20 - 5695.20] P:1661.84 E:0.315298 |  Sweden against Poland over on Torx Sport 2.
[5695.20 - 5696.20] P:1529.81 E:0.307530 |  Eight o'clock tomorrow night.
[5696.20 - 5698.20] P:1646.69 E:0.272574 |  Portugal, France at eight.
[5698.20 - 5702.20] P:1455.39 E:0.318681 |  And Germany, Hungary on Torx Sport 2.
[5702.20 - 5704.20] P:1245.01 E:0.351126 |  And England will find out who they're playing.
[5704.20 - 5705.20] P:1381.84 E:0.275313 |  We're in stoppage time.
[5705.20 - 5706.20] P:1742.28 E:0.286697 |  It's Maguire.
[5706.20 - 5708.20] P:1378.36 E:0.193992 |  Plays it back for Kyle Walker.
[5710.20 - 5713.20] P:1275.86 E:0.172951 |  Walker just down to the England right-hand side.
[5713.20 - 5714.20] P:1677.45 E:0.313616 |  For Henderson, he's lost out.
[5714.20 - 5715.20] P:1763.02 E:0.288027 |  Kral's got it.
[5715.20 - 5717.20] P:1859.59 E:0.311077 |  Late opportunity potentially for the Checks.
[5717.20 - 5720.20] P:1831.84 E:0.300627 |  And he's fired it well over the bar.
[5721.20 - 5722.20] P:1742.38 E:0.164054 |  Yeah.
[5722.20 - 5730.20] P:1543.18 E:0.229797 |  Just Henderson and Wolk's just got a little bit complacent there, as fair as I say.
[5730.20 - 5736.20] P:1270.82 E:0.189037 |  And Kral hit one from a place she can't score from, basically.
[5736.20 - 5739.20] P:1334.23 E:0.252655 |  Yeah, certainly one to file under optimistic that.
[5740.20 - 5745.20] P:1345.23 E:0.181798 |  England off to a fine fast start tonight.
[5745.20 - 5749.20] P:1621.28 E:0.302077 |  And then have just been able to manage the game very effectively in the second half.
[5751.20 - 5754.20] P:1366.76 E:0.179971 |  And that's a successful recipe.
[5754.20 - 5757.20] P:1153.67 E:0.119857 |  If you can pull it off.
[5757.20 - 5760.20] P:1605.51 E:0.255455 |  England not spectacular going forward in the second half.
[5760.20 - 5765.20] P:1443.81 E:0.236560 |  They haven't had to be, but so much more purpose and encouragement about the way they played
[5765.20 - 5769.20] P:1608.65 E:0.289945 |  in the first 45 minutes, which undoubtedly has been their best 45 minutes of the tournament so far.
[5769.20 - 5776.20] P:1582.23 E:0.281303 |  And the vast majority of the crowd of 19,000 here at Wembley tonight are going to be going home happy.
[5776.20 - 5778.20] P:1766.39 E:0.258704 |  Just a minute of stoppage time to go.
[5778.20 - 5780.20] P:1707.67 E:0.258655 |  Checks play it forward again.
[5780.20 - 5784.20] P:1792.49 E:0.261261 |  Another long ball hoisted high towards the edge of the penalty area.
[5784.20 - 5789.20] P:1620.80 E:0.268874 |  Maguire repels it, sends it forward, Kane chasing after it.
[5789.20 - 5790.20] P:1503.17 E:0.293654 |  All could bounce.
[5790.20 - 5795.20] P:1697.44 E:0.271492 |  Callisto just got there first ahead of Kane and was able to nod him back to his goalkeeper.
[5795.20 - 5796.20] P:1825.49 E:0.251042 |  40 seconds to go.
[5796.20 - 5798.20] P:1454.15 E:0.234714 |  Callisto, well there.
[5798.20 - 5801.20] P:1611.41 E:0.268286 |  That was a horrible ball to deal with the defenders.
[5801.20 - 5806.20] P:1526.50 E:0.270789 |  Just not long enough for the goalkeeper and you've got to deal with the bouncing ball going back to your own goal.
[5806.20 - 5812.20] P:1666.27 E:0.258678 |  One last chance then for the Checks potentially to get the goal that will take them top of the group.
[5812.20 - 5814.20] P:1723.42 E:0.257682 |  Tyrone Ming's in making the challenge.
[5814.20 - 5816.20] P:1913.67 E:0.310798 |  The offside flag has come up.
[5816.20 - 5822.20] P:1612.48 E:0.270900 |  It's a free kick which will be taken by England and by the time they spotted it down, Jordan Pickford to take it.
[5822.20 - 5823.20] P:1254.34 E:0.162034 |  That'll be that.
[5823.20 - 5825.20] P:1368.21 E:0.223443 |  And England, that's a job well done.
[5825.20 - 5827.20] P:1756.19 E:0.292486 |  Hasn't been spectacular.
[5827.20 - 5829.20] P:1647.56 E:0.244329 |  No one will pretend it has been.
[5829.20 - 5833.20] P:1545.85 E:0.229208 |  Played three, one, two, conceded none.
[5833.20 - 5835.20] P:1103.44 E:0.123817 |  Not too bad.
[5835.20 - 5837.20] P:1133.35 E:0.260355 |  More than happy with that.
[5837.20 - 5844.20] P:1403.60 E:0.262699 |  The key to the tournament for all is to get out of the group and get out of the group with a minimum of economy if you like.
[5844.20 - 5847.20] P:1758.82 E:0.332073 |  No suspensions that type of thing and we've achieved that.
[5847.20 - 5855.20] P:1900.56 E:0.318992 |  For the first time since the 1966 World Cup, England get out of the group of a major tournament without conceding a single goal.
[5855.20 - 5857.20] P:1775.56 E:0.300155 |  Seven points from nine.
[5857.20 - 5858.20] P:2023.85 E:0.326299 |  They finished top of the group.
[5858.20 - 5863.20] P:1925.28 E:0.310491 |  The parallels with 1966 are statistical only at the moment.
[5863.20 - 5866.20] P:1950.58 E:0.216439 |  But you just, just never know.
[5866.20 - 5870.20] P:1878.87 E:0.257258 |  England, unspectacular but effective.
[5870.20 - 5872.20] P:1934.61 E:0.282892 |  They got the job done tonight.
[5872.20 - 5873.20] P:1981.71 E:0.225773 |  Been in the Czechs.
[5873.20 - 5874.20] P:1829.72 E:0.322110 |  By a golden hill.
[5874.20 - 5876.20] P:1789.06 E:0.245780 |  Roll on the round of 16.
