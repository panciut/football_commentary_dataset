  "transcript": " He's watching this game. Certainly Thiago Silva was out there helping to plurt the players to warm up before we started. And now he get underway and Schweinsteiger immediately takes up that deep position in front of the back four. The Germans give the ball away. Luis Gustavo intercepted. Closer tries to go round Marcello. And now Marcello building over on the left-hand side. Five live. Breathtaking fixture. Germany, Brazil. The ball played forward. Schweinsteiger cuts it out. It almost dropped to Oscar. The Brazilians trying to set an early tempo here. And Bernhard is playing up on this right-hand side at the moment. The ball is played forward to Fernandinho. Fernandinho is going to try and win a corner kick. I think he might have made it down there. Brazil attacking right from the start. With Maicon doing good work. And they have this corner inside the first minute of the game. The first test for Neuer and his defenders. Fernandinho makes his way into the six-yard area. David Luiz is there. Who's been quite a specialist in the knockout stage of the World Cup with goals. The corner kick to be taken by Oscar. But before it does, there's something happening on the goal line between Neuer and Fernandinho. Which the Mexican referee sorts out. And now we're ready. Oscar prepares. Bernhard offers his services. And it goes, headed away by the Germans. Well defended there by the centre-backs. Marcello picks up the loose ball. And Hulck, who seems to be playing over on the left-hand side at the moment, finds Dante, who's stayed forward following the corner. And it goes, headed away by Hoveders. The Germans haven't crossed the half-way line yet. Now they might as Chris Ohersels tumbled over. And Brazil have the ball again down this right-hand side of the field. David Luiz is pointing to Oscar. Fred is waiting in the penalty area. Oscar turns the ball back a little short to Luis Castarvo. But Castarvo goes snapping into the challenge. And this is a really good start from Brazil. Castarvo again with Fred Poist in the area. By the corner flag, inviting the challenge. Looking for the corner, it's a throw. Dante? This is exactly how the Brazil start against Colombia. On the front foot, Hulck is on that left-hand side. A lot of people expect him Bernhard to play over there. But he played very, very well, especially the first half against Colombia. Got the ball and ran up people, caused problems. Castarvo on the edge of the German area. He falls over as well. But Marcello intercepts ahead of Muller. Marcello shot his one. And the Brazilians are rather optimistically appealing for a corner kick. It's not there for them. A little bit of late evening sunshine breaks through. It's certainly been overcast over the last couple of hours. But it's absolutely perfect conditions for this semi-final. Well, Brazil very much on the front foot. I think Luis Castarvo was tricked by Schweinsteiger. Referee again, been a little bit lenient. But we've seen a lot of that during this World Cup so far. But Brazil very much on the front foot. I think they want to get at this German side early on. Botein's rather aimless ball out of defence. That really isn't very German like at all. They do keep possession most of the time. The morning newspaper in Belorosante. The big headline this morning was BH Belorosante. Capital de Mundo. That's how they see it here. Long ball forward down the left-hand side, looking for Hulk. Lambs let it run on. And Hulk has got there. And Hulk pulls the ball back. And Neuer makes the diving save. And I'm surprised that Lam wasn't tighter there on Hulk over on the far side. Well, at the moment, the Germans are rattled. They're giving the ball away here. A couple of long balls so far. Now they've got a chance to go forward. Kedira picks up closer. In steps, David Louise. Closer rides the challenge. But then he's helped out by the player who's come in for Thiago Silverdante, playing in the World Cup for the first time this evening. The man who made his Brazilian debut when Scolari returned to Brazil at Wembley against England in February 2013. On five live, the Germans can just see now, they're just trying to calm things down here and get a little feel of the ball because they haven't had any possession at all early on here. Just listen to the crowd, though, Mike. Every time the Germans get it, there's Buen, there's Jiren. Every Brazilian pass is a cheer and a lay. This is going to be some atmosphere. And I think this is going to be some game. Throw into Germany. All out of play from Michael. Holding off Danny Alves now in that right back position. Throw into the Germans. Robertus takes it. Nobody's picked up Tony Kruse. Kruse lifts it down the right-hand side to Lam. First time we've seen the Germans really coming forward. Lam tucks the ball back into midfield and Kedira. This is better now from Germany. Schweinsteiger, though, doesn't go forward. Keeps possession, plays it back to Boateng. Little flick from Kedira, Muller's there over on the right-hand side. And the crowd are cheering because Germany have the ball, not for long now. Oscar down the left-hand side and the ball is nicked away from him by Philippe Lam, the German captain. And Brazil have a throw in on the halfway. Sensational atmosphere here. And Bella Horizonte for the first of these two semifinals. Germany nil, Brazil nil. And we've played just under five minutes of a breathless first half-star. Ball back with Julio Cesar in the Brazilian goal. Brazil now building with Luis Gustavo. Who knows all about these German players, of course. He plays now with Wolfsburg, but had great success with Bayern Munich. Here's the Bayern Munich centre-back Dante. Back again to Luis Gustavo. Scolari's pointing down there. Brazil trying to stay patient here. And the ball is back again with Gustavo. He's almost playing as one of three centre-backs at the moment. Brazil just keeping it, just biding their time. Then it's nudged into the centre-circle and given away by Fernandinho. Poor first touch, though, by Mesut Erzl. And it comes crashing forward from the left-back Hoveders. And Julio says, ah, well, he might have left that, but he's kept it in so he can clear for Brazil. Again, Brazil are snapping into the tackles like they did against Colombia. But also, when Germany get it, they're playing a very, very high tempo, closing people down. A very bright start from the Brazilian team. Why do you think that they've... Well, you all expected Bernardo to play left and Holt right, didn't we? Any reason why they're not doing that? I think Holt played really well, especially in the last game. He got the ball and he ran at people. Philip Larmes, not the quickest, not getting any younger. The ball is out of play and the Germans... It's just very unusual, Danny, I did the game against France in the quarter-final when the Germans just had a stranglehold right from the start, but they rattled here. I think this anthem, the atmosphere, gives the Brazilian players such a lift in the first 10, 15 minutes. You can almost see the adrenaline pumping out of them. You know, faces, veins, you know, the intensity on their faces. They've got to control that, but that certainly gives them an edge in the first 10, 15 minutes in terms of energy, closing people down. Well, it was 64 years ago to this day that Brazil beat Spain 6-1 to effectively qualify for the 1950 World Cup final, which they lost, of course, to Uruguay. And they've won their last six World Cup semi-finals and here now go Germany dangerously down the right-hand side. Muller is poised on the edge of the area and it goes, travels a very long way. Erzl's there. Erzl tacks it in. Kedira had a shot, which was blocked. Germany's best move. Muller again over on the right-hand side. Suddenly Germany pounced and almost cut through. Muller down the right-hand side, taking on Dante. Still Muller, trying to dink the ball into the area. Boateng is now supporting this latest attack. That's a rather aimless ball into the area and the free kick is given against Germany, against Closer for the foul on David Louise. But Germany then just causing Brazil for the first time a few problems. Well, if Germany can manage to soak up the pressure, which they will do at times, they will then hit the Macauge. Actually, the ball hit Tony Cruz on the back side. There's a ball cut across the area from Erzl. But that's what the Germans will do. They will sit back. They will soak up this pressure. They will take it. They will remain cool. They will remain collected. But when they get the ball, they have the quality to go and hurt you as well. The Brazilians building slowly from the back and Hoverdez almost used his arm to control that. But he has the ball, the left back from Schalke. Looks for Erzl, who's struggling to make an impact here. Maikon takes the ball away from Erzl. Maikon's ball in towards Frett on the edge of the area. Frett brings it down, almost got that through to Oskar. Brilliant defending though by Schweinsteiger to Germany. And a good ball out of defense. But immediately, Brazil trying to smother Germany in central midfield. But Germany still get going. It's crossed down the left-hand side. Muller is calling for it over on the far side. The ball is cut back to Kedira. 25 yards out. Kedira on now to Muller. Muller down the German right-hand side. But Marcelo makes a very important interception. And then he's caught by Muller. And the free kick will have to be given. But Muller's a specialist at finding space. And Marcelo's going to have to be really on his game tonight. Such a contrast in styles, isn't it? Even then, David-Louise came forward, lost attack on him. The Brazil defense was all over the shop. But they streamed back in numbers. You know, it's all about effort and passion for Brazil. Germany, it's about control. You know, staying cool, keeping possession of the ball. Both teams have been guilty of giving the ball away at the moment. But I think that's understandable. A lot of nerves about. And I'm struck by how slowly Brazil are building from inside their own half. And then they're looking to try and hit diagonal balls. And just looking for some precision to trouble. And there's a bit of an exchange down there between Closer and Louise. And that's going to be a free kick to Brazil. David-Louise is now really taken over from Neymar as the poster boy here. His face was all over the front pages of the papers this morning. And he takes a free kick. And that's an interesting one towards Hulk over on the far side. Hulk reaches for it, doesn't control it. Across comes Philippe Lange. Hulk trying to turn away from the German captain. Hulk still supported by Marcelo. And that move has broken down. And the Germans are breaking. And Kedira's on the ball. And the Brazilians haven't cut it out. And now Thomas Müller for Germany. Really good counterattack here. Kedira has a chance to pull it in towards Closer. Instead has to settle for a corner kick. This is Germany's first corner. But remember, with people like Hummels down there, they can be very dangerous. I don't want to put the moccasins on it, but it looks like it's shaped up to be a really entertaining game, isn't it? Brazil clearly trying to isolate the full backs. Hit diagonals over the top for Bernard and Holtzra on two. Germany quite happy to soak up the pressure from the counterattack. Corner kick to Germany. All eyes maybe on Hummels who score that goal against France. In goes the corner kick. Troubles a very long way and it's gone in. And that man has done it again, Thomas Müller. Nobody picked him up at the far post. Müller wrapped his right leg around it. And this specialist in tournament football, Thomas Müller, maybe the key man in this German side, has stunned Belahorizonte. He's given the Germans the lead after 10 minutes. Brazil nail Germany 1. Disaster almost for Brazil. We're on the front foot on top. The ball comes in. Nobody at all is marking Müller. I think it's David Luiz. He's lost his man. He's got a little bit wrapped up in his first 10 minutes. He's had a couple of challenges. Hasn't picked his man up. Müller just a little bit of movement, just pulled off the shoulder. And well, a very, very simple finish. Five goals hit for now. But that's David Luiz. Wrapped up, you know, he was chasing down a minute ago. He had a clash with Closer. That's what we talked about. He has to remain disciplined. The emotion and adrenaline has gone a little bit too much for him. He's just lost concentration. Well, I think it was said during the build-up to this game that Thiago Silva helps to protect David Luiz. He's no partner tonight, but now can Brazil respond down that left-hand side with Hulk? Hulk challenged by Bote. And that's going to be a goal kick for Germany. Well, if you've been with us from the start, you'd have gathered that it was an alien atmosphere here for the German side. But now they've scored that goal. They're really going to settle into the semi-finals. They'll take all the pressure off the Germans. But I think now Brazil have to keep doing what they're doing and start attacking and at every opportunity. You know, this crowd will get behind them all the way through the game. But like we said, contrast in styles, Germany, cool as you like. One chance, bang, back of the net goal. He's a phenomenal talent, Thomas Muller, the man, of course, who really undid England at the last World Cup. He's now scored five goals at this World Cup. He's won behind Rodriguez, the Colombian, and well, Brazil have been caught. And it was a goal to really distress Luis Filipe Scolari, because it was so basic, so straightforward, from the corner kick, from the set piece, and it really shouldn't have happened. Julio says, are clears. So all that early exuberance here has been, in a sense, quashed by that German goal. Can the Brazilians now come back again? They haven't found themselves in this position at the tournament, as that's a nameless ball from Louise, and that's straight through to Neuer once more. And I'm not surprised to see Scolari down there trying to just sort a few things out. Well, they clearly had a game plan, which was to use diagonal balls, get him behind the full backs. But David Louise... Ball headed on by closer to Muller. He doesn't take it cleanly, though, and Louise steps in. I'll bring back Danny again in a moment, as Louise now strides forward to try and redeem the error. Ball down the left-hand side to play in Hulke. Fred is steaming in the area. Hulke is there. The drag back, though, has only gone to a German player, and Lawn will clear and find the man who's always in space, Muller, over on the right-hand side. The goal scorer here. Muller thinks he was fouled, and the referee agrees. But again, concentration. You know, David Louise, we've seen how energetic he gets. We've seen the passion in his face. Even at the moment, he's trying to be everywhere, running on over the shop. I've already said that, you know, when they break, the Brazilian defence looks disorganised. You know, they all run back in numbers. There's no real authority there. And you know, David Louise, the emotion just got him. Lost concentration for a split second. Thomas Muller, 10 goals now in World Cup football. He's still got two World Cups left as well. He's probably going to break that record of 15 goals, isn't he? Well, I'm sure you're right, Danny. Of course, closest hoping to do that tonight. He's on 15 with Ronaldo. If there was any self-doubt about these Brazilians losing Neymar and Tiago Silva, well, surely that's increased here now, following that goal. From Thomas Muller to give Germany a 1-0 lead. You're listening to Five Live from the first of the semi-finals. Much for Brazil to do now. Marcelo can't go forward. And the German side look all together now more settled outfit down there, rather torrid opening. The ball is with Hulk for Brazil. And I'm not quite sure what he's trying to do. He digs the ball down the right-hand side. But Bernard had come in from the touchline, and that's gone out of play. And what the Brazilians need to pick me up here. It's a throw-in to Germany. And interestingly, now they're just calming things down as well. They have the goal. Long way to go, though, still in the game. And the throw-in is taken towards closer. And as a pilt of handball, and it's given by the referee, free kick is quickly taken by Cruz. Nobody picked up Kedira. The Brazilians just a little slack at times with their marking. Cruz now. A challenge came in from Bernard. And it was rugged. And it's a free kick to Germany, short of the halfway line. I think the Germans are going to go down for free kicks at any opportunity. Any time a challenge comes in, they're going to ground. And I think they're trying to save the referee. Look, you cannot keep allowing this to go on. And again, that's a clear ploy after what happened in the last Brazilian game. I mean, what would have really upset Scolari here was that it was just a straightforward corner kick. And they would have spent a lot of time as now Germany moved towards the penalty area, but Louise is there. They presumably would have done all of their blackboard homework. They would have identified Hummels in particular as a danger. And in the end, nobody picked up Thomas Muller. And he wrapped the ball home for Germany with his right foot. And now Gustavo and Maicon trying to energise Brazil. Maicon for Fernandinho near side. Down the line, we haven't seen much of Bernardo. But that's a decent ball now for Maicon. Fred's in the area. Maicon can't get the ball though. In, it was blocked by Hoveders. And Erzl still struggling to make an impact down this left-hand side. And the ball is out of play for a German throw-in once more. We've played 16 minutes of the first half here, in better horizontal. And the hosts are up against it. Germany lead through Muller's goal. Very disappointing goal from Brazilian's point of view. Sometimes we saw with, like, Hummels-Rodriguez score an absolute wonder goal. You can't do an awful lot about that at times. But from a corner-asset piece, where a player loses concentration, loses marker, that's stoppable. That is preventable. Scallari will be absolutely furious with David Luiz. Good ball from Oscar now to Hulk. And now Marcelo cuts into the penalty area. Driving run for Marcelo. He's gone down under the challenge from Laam, looking for a penalty. Referee has given a corner kick only, and one or two players square up on the edge of the six-yard area. No penalty for me. Philip Laam, I think he's going to struggle in this game with a pace. Players running out, and we've seen that. And I think that Brazilian are going to try and exploit that at times. But he dived in, tackled from behind. For me, clearly won the ball without seeing the replay. Right decision from the referee. Oscar threaded the ball through initially. He has to play well tonight, if Brazillor going to get into the World Cup final. Corner kick to Brazillor over on the far side. There are words now between the referee, and Marcelo, and also Bote. But we did see it in the first game, didn't we? You know, the referee's come under all sorts of pressure from the home crowd. Just seen it on the replay. Dead right. Fantastic challenge from Philip Laam. But he did get done with pace. Now, Germany scored from the corner, but this is a really poorly delivered corner by Brazillor. And they find themselves back on the half-way line now with Maikom. Germany leading 1-0 on five-lives. A great ball now from Marcelo to find Oscar inside the area. Oscar turns. That's been lifted up in the air by Hommels, the German defender. Oscar jumping again. Louise is supporting this latest attack. There'll always be danger, though, when Germany try and counterattack, looking for the flick-ons from the likes of Kloser and Muller. And now, Brazillor looked to Marcelo. The only thing that Jokam Lowe maybe will want more from is maybe Erzl down this left-hand side. The game is passing him by at the moment, but he won't mind the score line at least in his favour. All the... Most of the German danger is coming over on the right-hand side. And now Muller picks up the ball once more. Thomas Muller trying to thread the ball through for Kruse. Now, the Brazilians counterattack. Little Bernard on the half-way line, maybe running into trouble, invited the challenge, looked as if he was fouled by Kedira. Referees played advantage. Marcelo for Brazill, plenty of options. Oscars, though, disappointingly from the home side, played the ball back. Marcelo again is rampaging forward and then loses his way, and now he's out of position. And this is the problem. Muller is in space over on the far side. And when Marcelo goes forward, they have to cover. And they didn't. And fortunately for Brazill, the ball to Muller wasn't very good. It was too high for Muller to control. But that is a problem for them. Somebody does need to cover when Marcelo makes these runs forward. It's incredibly gung-ho, isn't it, from Brazill at the moment. They get the ball, they're running at people, chasing forward. They leave themselves exposed at the back at the times. Germany can keep themselves cool under pressure. Brazill could get hit quite easily on the counterattack. Well, because Muller is one of the best players in the world at exploiting exactly that kind of scenario. And now a ball from Dante. And Marcelo's loving to go forward here, but his problems are when he's having to defend. He's want to throw in over on the far side. This is where the likes of Gustavo have to come back in particular. And maybe Fernandinho when Marcelo decides to drive forward. Gustavo again, Germany leading 1-0. Gustavo finding Louise. And now Oscar just inside the German half. Fred hasn't had much to feed off so far. Maicon near side the Brazilian right. Good ball onto Oscar, though doesn't control it. Germany looking to try and counterattack. Schweinsteiger who's just sitting in front of the back four, looking to release Erzal down this near side. Erzal gets, gets it in and tries to get away from Louise, who just gets his body in the way and gives the ball back to his goalkeeper. Giulio Cesar, who now clears, non-too effectively. Bernhard comes in and then just gives the ball away back to the German midfield. And that German midfield now starting to assert itself. Ball played down the centre. Lovely flick to Miroslav, closer. Closer though, on the edge of the area is outnumbered by Yellowshirts. Giulio Cesar gets the back pass and then can only find touch with his clearance. All a little bit panicky in that Brazilian defence when Germany get the ball in decent possession. And I said, this is almost what we expected from the start. Brazil frantic at times, chasing all over the place. Germany playing very, very cool. Yeah, using all the tactical nows that they have. Germany leading 1-0 and moving towards the midway point of the first half. Now, Boateng's got a lot of space, the defender. Boateng now up towards the edge of the area. Back again to Boateng, again that man Muller is waiting. Kedira has it. Little wrestling match with Bernard. This is danger here though, as the shot is driven in then low and without any power from closer. But the Germans are starting to create positions here to trouble Scolari's side. And there is much to sort out defensively. The ball is now down below us with Fred. He finds Maicon. Maicon's going to have to hold this because there's nobody really in an advanced position. Oscar helps him out on the halfway. Oscar to Fernandinho. In comes a snapping challenge from Bruce. Brazilians keep it. And now Louise hits one of those diagonal balls to the far side of the field. It rears up at Marcelo and he's done very well to keep it in. Now Hulk trying to shake off the defenders. Hulk played it forward towards Fred, but the Germans are defending well. And now here they go again down the right-hand side. And once more galloping down the right is Muller. Brazilians, Gustavo trying to come back. Ball played in by Muller, but at the near post it was cleared for throwing over on the far side. 1-0 to Germany. I think Brazilians are going to have to change something. They're too cavalier at the moment. They're going forward. Marcelo is charging down that left-hand side. But when they give it away, they're just getting hit on the counter-attack. And Fernandinho's completely missed that ball and Tony Cruce has got it. It's gone into the area to Muller. And there's a chance for Closer. Great save from Cesar, but Closer's there! Second time round to break Ronaldo's record. Against all teams, he's done it against Brazilians in the semi-final. His sixth-deep goal in World Cup finals. It's a new record. It gives Germany a 2-0 lead. And is there any way back now for the hosts? Brazil at times. The fence has been in absolute shambles. Players all over the place. A square ball played into the middle. Fernandinho took his eye off it. It should have been cut out. It wasn't. And then when the ball came in, a little 1-2 on the edge of the box. Closer, Muller has the first chance. It's a decent save, but it comes straight back out to Closer. It just tucks it away. Very, very simple finish in the end. But Brazil all over the shop. Clearly missing Thiago Silva. A moment of history. A Brazilian World Cup record broken in the semi-final against them by a German player. It's the halfway point of the first half. Germany lead 2-0, and here's Ian Dennis. Thank you, Mike. Just said to Mark Purgac before taking over the commentary duties. Blumfontein. Every time, Germany are going forward. I can't help but think of Blumfontein. I think every English fan who was in that stadium was hurt as the ball is over the top towards Bernardo and haunted by the way that Germany... How ruthless they were, but the same thing is happening here. They've got the goal in front before the second goal, and they're picking Brazil off. And it's no surprise to see them get the second, and I won't be surprised if they win three or four. Well, it's been a little bit too easy for Germany going forward at the moment, but I said before the game, all the passion, all the fire in the bellies, but the Germans, as we know, have ice in their blood, a very calm under pressure. Clinical. Larmus forward on the right-hand side, Moolas missed it. Cross for the shots. There's the third goal. Fiercely struck. Low, left-footed. Cesar had no chance, and Germany now lead Brazil 3-0. And in a stadium that he's soaked in yellow, a black cloud looms large in Bellahorizonte. Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable. Just looking at some of the faces of the Brazilian players. We get close-ups on the monitors, the fans. They are in shock. Deep, deep shock. Again, it was a simple goal that should have been cut out. And it's Larmus cross. Moola missed the first opportunity. It was pretty much unmarked. It came to Tony Cruz at the far side of the box, and just drove it in at the near post. Moola completely unmarked. Cruz completely unmarked. Brazil 3-0 down. Devastating. There is a hum around the stadium, but the Brazilian balloons have had those balloons popped, with the exception of a large chunk of white, of the German support away to our right-hand side, who are jumping up and down. In fact, they're threatening again. Here is Kadeera. Kadeera back to Cruz. It's a second goal. Brazil are capitulating, and the Germans are romping their way through to the final in the American R. Brazil 0. Germany 4. Unbelievable. Almost speechless. We've just seen a little child in the crowd crying his eyes out. This is, we never expected this. And after the start, where Brazil started quite well, they've just been hit on the counterattack time and time again. Brazil have gone completely at the moment. This could end up 7 or 8 in a World Cup semi-final. Brazil at the moment have got no answer to this at all. There are shambles. There are absolute shambles at the back, Brazil. And Germany are taking full advantage and some. And now all of a sudden, we've got a scenario where Brazil as the host nation have just got to damage limitation. Supporters are in tears around us here in Belo Horizonte. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. When I said that I could see Germany winning 3 or 4, I didn't necessarily mean, within 4 minutes of picking up the commentary mic, that they're going to add two more goals. Shell shot. The nation of Brazil is absolutely shell shot. An example of how clinical Germany have been. I think they've had four shots on target and they've scored four goals. They might have had five shots on target, but they have been exceptional. Clinical, efficient. Schweinsteiger sits in front of the back four. All that passion, all that flair from the Brazilians in the first few minutes. You know, I'm looking at, I'm trying to find David Luiz now on the pitch. He should be playing centre half and he stood halfway up the pitch in midfield. This was always going to be a problem. Once they considered that first goal, their heads have now dropped. They are all over the place. Big fill on the touch line, throwing his hands in the air. You have to say 4-0, that's it, game over. And it really could be a case of how many the Germans want to score now. Throw from Marcelo. Chested off by Fred. Ball played back in. Bernhard is coming forward now. Bernhard then towards Holt. Mijkon on the overlap on the right-hand side, if he wants him. Tried to flick the ball with his left foot in field. Collected that loose ball by Fernandinho. They'll run on this right-hand side. Yellow shirts and blue shorts. Playing from left to right as we look. Plays it back towards Mijkon, right-hand side. Prouded out by three German players. And Hubertes will be the one who will just clear it out of play. And it'll be a Brazilian throw. Mijkon to take it. Here is Holt. Right corner of the penalty area. Holt caught by Hubertes. No, Holt goes to ground too easily. And that says the referee is a goal kick. Orafa Honigstein back in our studio in Rio. What do you make of this scoreline? 4-0 to Germany. It's hard to believe really, especially if you consider Germany had such a shaky start. They looked nervous in the first five minutes. They gave the ball away. Brazil took the game to them. Everything changed after the Mule goal. Brazil suddenly, I think, felt the danger of getting knocked out in Germany. The confidence just took them. And every time they went forward, they scored. Three goals in four minutes. They were blitz with Brazil. We'll have further discussions, I'm sure, with... With a referee half-time. Germany 4-0. Brazil 0-0. Not an only one for statistics here, but again, a percentage. Percentage of play. Brazil 65% almost of the play. They're in again here, Germany. This is Kedera. He's got options. He's pulled the ball back to Erzl. Here is Kedera again. And Kedera strokes the ball in right footed. It's a fifth goal for Germany. It's truly astonishing in Belo Horizonte. Germany a running riot. Brazil 0. Germany 5. We haven't even played half an hour. Defences capitulated. Really don't know what to say. But the whole stadium is almost just silence in shock. It's just incredible. That was so easy. Erzl, you know, just dropping the ball back. Kedera could have shot first time. No, waits for Erzl. Gets the ball back on the second one. Slots the ball home. I really don't know what to say. You know, I think the romantics in this wanted Brazil to be in the final. In the American R, maybe it's Argentina. But fair play to the Germans. They have been exceptional. Apart from that first maybe 10, 15 minutes or so where they came up with a little bit of pressure. They remain calm. Noia didn't really have a save to make in that time. But they have been clinical. Exceptional when going forward. On the counterattack. And they have put this Brazilian side. They've made them look defensively worse than schoolboys. My worry now inside the stadium is that this could really turn quite ugly in terms of the atmosphere. Because wherever you look, particularly way to our right hand side now, there are more and more stewards in their luminous orange jackets. And Brazil trailing by five goals to nil. If there was a concede more goals, not only would it be a national humiliation, but I think then it could quickly turn from that carnival atmosphere to something a little bit more sinister. Tim Vickery is also in our studio alongside Rafa Honigstein. Tim. Yeah, you do worry about this. You worry about the way that crowd are capable of turning on their own players. I knew some of the players from 1950. A great side who lost 2-1 in the last few minutes to Uruguay. They were never, ever able to forget it. One of them told me years afterwards, he was still worried about people coming at him with a knife because he lost that game. Now, Denau, you mentioned there, if there's more goals, it might be a humiliation. I think after the third goal, we are already in humiliation territory. Defensive line for Brazil, an absolute shambles. And if you were giving points out of 10 so far, you might give Fernandinho one for putting his shirt on the right way around. An absolute shambolic performance from the man who's supposed to protect the centre-backs. They're all over the place defensively. I think you've picked up very well on the fear for the atmosphere here. Here is Lawn. Lawn pulls the ball back. Gros, sticks and deflection goes wide. They are exposing Brazil time and time and time again. And it's a corner kick to Germany. Five-nil. Every time Germany come forward, they look like scoring. Corner is taken short on the left-hand side. Here is Erzl. This now is Schweinsteiger. Schweinsteiger with a short-daggle ball to Kaderer. Back to Boateng. Every German player is inside the Brazilian half. Lawn with a cross, takes a slight deflection. The Fred, who's been anonymous, is back doing some defensive work. And bearing in mind that Germany scored five before the half-hour, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the biggest margin of victory in a World Cup is nine goals. You wouldn't rule out, bearing in mind that they've scored five before the half-hour. How many more, then, will they add between now and the 90-minute mark? I'm sure Kroosl will be thinking, how many more can I add? Thomas Muller as well, how many more can I get? Kroosl slows records as well. David Luiz has just sighed into the back of Muller. And that's also another worry. We know that these Brazilians are a little bit hot-headed at times. It could spill over. I wouldn't surprise them at some point if a Brazilian loses cool and gets a red card. It's a nightmare for Brazil. It is a nightmare where they're 5-0 down. We've got 13 minutes to go to halftime. It is a remarkable scoreline here on Five Live. I would think that tomorrow's semi-final would be a lot tighter in Sao Paulo, Argentina against Holland. We'll get a two-hour build-up ahead of that nine-o-clock kickoff from Sao Paulo. And, of course, Sunday's final in the Maracanar. A week ago, I sat in the Copa Cabana as here is Kadeira. And it's Kroosl, closed down by Finandinho, trying to thread that ball through towards Laam. And I said with Jonathan Overand that I could see Germany picking off Brazil. But I never, and I don't think anybody envisaged this scenario. And certainly this scoreline, Danny Mills, never in a million years. You'd have never gone out and put, you know... I don't think you've even put maybe four-0, you know, as a bet over the course of the whole game. Now, this is likely to end up six, seven, you know, as you said. Nine is the record. Would be incredible. Just Germany have just been stereotypical. And they've been German. They've been efficient. They've been clinical. Here is Closet. Closet runs the man over on that far side. He's locked to go through the middle towards Kadeira. And in fact, they had even had Erzel on the left-hand side. In their red and black horizontal striped shirts, Germany are going forward at every opportunity and look like they're going to score at every opportunity. It is unbelievable how that the Brazilian defence is all over the shop. David Luiz, supposed to be the other, the Marshal, was hoping that he was going to step up to the plate. Not at all. Louis Gustavo in the middle, Fernandinho in non-existent. I talked about that really important square, that block of four players, the two-centre midfield players, the two-centre defenders. That's where you get hurt. And that has been incredibly weak for Brazil. Laam to Mula. Mula in field to Erzel. Challenge comes in from Fernandinho. Croce will pick up that ball closer. Just prods it back then towards, closer to Croce. And then the ball goes out and it'll be Marcello who'll play it forward towards Bernard. It's gone completely flat in Belo Horizonte. Bernard then towards Fred. We know that this is a Brazil side with their limitations, as Hulk triggers the offside trap. And that'll be a free kick. And the other thing to remember as well is that this is a Brazilian side, as Mike Ingram has pointed out, that are unbeaten at home since August 2002. Now that was a slightly strange game because they just won the World Cup, playing against Paraguay in August. But since then it is a run of 42 successive home matches, where they are undefeated on Brazilian soil. It's 39 years since they last lost a competitive fixture at home in the semifinal of the Copa America. But to lose in this manner, and there could yet be further goals, well they talk about the Maracanar blow when they lost the final in 1952 Uruguay. This is a hammer blow here in 2014. Out towards LaM on that far side. Germany level with the penalty area. Marcello will not keep the ball in play as he tries to hook it clear to throw to Germany. Well the game's over, simple as that now. Looking around, Brazilian fans clearly do not know what to make of this. It's been, I've never seen a game like it. This magnitude, to be so overwhelmed by the opposition, is absolutely staggering. Here is Germany coming forward once again, trying to thread that ball through towards closer. Only cleared as far as LaM on that far side for Germany. He'll go in field. Crose, who's on a hat-trick. Waits for Nandinho stumbles. The toying with, Germany are toying with Brazil. It's meant to be the semifinal of a World Cup. And 179 seconds between the second and fourth goal. Brazil, they've gone simple as that. Luis Gustavo has just put a crew challenge on Thomas Muller. I think we might start to see a little bit more of that. It's almost too late to try and restore some pride. We talked about before the game that Germany might be the slight favourites. If Brazil were to lose, the pressure's off because Naimeau wasn't there. But we were thinking maybe a 2-1 or a 1-0, something like that. This isn't getting beaten. This is being humiliated. Annihilated as well for a Brazilian side that are reeling here in Belo Horizonte. Five live, your World Cup station for 2014. The second semi to come tomorrow, the final on Sunday. We already know that Germany will be there as the ball is clipped over the top and that will go out of play from Erzal for a goal kick to Brazil. And we've still got seven minutes to go to halftime. I'd like to hear the reaction from the Brazilian supporters at halftime. Just remove the left headphone. I'll tell you what it'll be. It'll be booze. Simple as that for every single Brazilian player. Bizarre. They started the game on the front foot. It was a little bit gun-ho, a little bit frantic in their play, but they started to have a bit of a go. But then once Germany got a little bit of a foothold in the game, overcame that pressure, if you like. So clinical going forward. Superb on the counterattack. And it really is very, very difficult to try and explain how good the Germans have been. Schweinsteiger just epitomises everything about the Germans. He's just sat there, controlled the game, hardly giving the ball away. Absolutely superb. And also how bad the Brazilians have been. Well, defensively, it's been an absolute nightmare for them. They've been all over the shop. David Louise, I think there was a clip beforehand. I said, you know, often plays centre-back forward. You know, he goes on these mazes, he runs. That's brilliant. That, he gets away with it when Tiago Silva is that rock beside him. Dante's not good enough to do that role. He's relatively inexperienced and he's only got 12 caps before today. At the back, you know, Mykon is okay. Marcelo was bombing down the left-hand side, but leaving himself very, very exposed. And the Germans just have that control, that self-belief. Give us the ball, you know what? And we will control the game and eventually we will score. And they scored five in such a short space of time. If we were in Spain now, they'd have the white hankies out. The only white things that are being waved at the minute are the German fans celebrating high up on that right-hand side. Whether it's the shirts that they've taken off, or they've been swung around their heads. Mike, I know you've got a programme coming up, haven't you? Where you're looking back at eight-world tournaments on Friday at nine and Sunday at one. You've covered eight tournaments. Well, this is your eighth World Cup. What are your thoughts at this stage? Well, the only thing that I can think of that's comparable in the first half of a World Cup game, and I'm just watching Germany come forward again. The only thing I can think of that shocked me to the extent that tonight has was when North Korea went into a 4-0 lead against Portugal in the quarter-final in England in 1966. But then, of course, Portugal had Eusebio. And at 3-0 they went up, and then Eusebio came back to score four. And Portugal went through, but in all the World Cups I've covered, no, nothing like this in the first half. This is absolutely unprecedented. Marcelo over towards Bernard on that far side, stopped by Germany, who are leading 5-0. Muller with the first, closer with the second. He has now broken Ronaldo's record. He's the all-time leading scorer in the World Cup. This Hulk tries to chip a ball through. Croce has got two, and Kadeera strokes in the fifth. This worth reiterating that program, as Mike reflects on his World Cup years. Friday at 9 o'clock, and Sunday at 1, the final, of course, in American art, and tomorrow Argentina against Holland from 9 o'clock. Just to get that straight again, it was 3-0, I think North Korea went up, but it was dramatic. Brazil looking for a consolation. Oscar with a shot charged down. Cannons away over towards that far side. People are numb inside this stadium. I think even the Neutrals are too, because nobody, nobody expected this. It's incredible. To put it into perspective, England beat Moldova 5-0. You know, this is Germany beating Brazil. In Brazil, 5-0 within half an hour of the game. I just really... It is, you're right, it is, everybody is almost numb. You know, with sort of like... Is this surreal? You know, is this a dream? Is this a nightmare? It was a complete nightmare for the Brazilians. But they've just been ripped apart. It can't go on enough. Defensively awful. Started with David Luiz, lost concentration, all that passion. You know, got himself a little bit heads up, a little bit worked up, looking at the ball, took his eye off Muller, and that was it. Once that first goal went in, you just saw the Germans growing confidence, growing belief. And they've just ripped this Brazilian team apart. And now it's a training round exercise. The other thing to say, Danny, is if they concede again, it will equal their record defeat, which was against Uruguay in the South American Championships back in September of 1920. Brazil don't lose at home. They certainly don't lose in this manner. Well, if they don't concede again, I will be flabbergasted. I think if they don't concede again, it'll be just as much a surprise as they are being 5-0 down now. Well, a lot will depend, I suppose, on how Germany then approach the second half, won't it? But even still Germany, even if it's played at walking pace, they will create one or two chances. And have we seen so far? They don't need many chances. They probably had six or seven chances. They've scored five goals. Brazil are at walking pace, and here is Hulk. Hulk goes past a couple of half-hearted challenges. Fernandinho slides in. Two minutes to go to halftime. This will be one of the longest nights in the history of Brazilian football, because every minute is going to seem like an hour, trailing 5-0 in the semifinal as a host nation against Germany, and totally and utterly humiliated. 90 seconds remain of normal time. It's flat, hardly surprising. I wonder how long those Brazilian players will remain in the dressing room after the game. It could be a couple of hours, because I think when this bus leaves, we saw the amount of people clapping the bus as it came in. That ain't going to be up in on the way out. Marcelo with the free kick flags up on this near-hand side. Well, the Germans are celebrating. There are 12,000 bars, do you know, in Belo Horizonte. They won't be filled tonight with Brazilians. There might be the... I don't know, two, three thousand Germans who are inside this stadium here in Belo Horizonte. In fact, I would imagine that most of those 12,000 bars would have closed early. The shutters will be up. And they might not want to open up those shutters, just like they might not want to open up the curtains tomorrow morning. Such further that we've seen in Brazil, football mad nation, where football is at the very soul of this country, but they will be hurting like no other tonight. We're about to see how much added on time at halftime, but a Brazilian team that are on their knees. What does Big Field do at halftime now? It can't change it really and say, well, let's go for it because they did that and they've been ripped apart. Marcelo coming forward, away from Fred. And Noy will be there. And Noy just plays it early. One minute of added on time, which we're now into. But if the players don't have a go, they'll be accused of being no pride in it. I think it's now almost an impossible team talk for Scolari. Whatever he does, whatever he says to these players, they've got to come out and play some pride in the second half. But it almost has to accept defeat and just say, look, the game's over, lads. You've lost it. You've blown your chance of becoming absolute legends in this country. The only you not going to become legends, you are going to become villains for the rest of your lives. The headline will be written. However, the script to the story is still not finished yet because it could get a lot, lot worse for Brazil. Training 5-0. You might be able to hear the strains of the German fans already celebrating. Ball from Louise. Hulk will not keep that ball in play. That will be a goal kick. Thiago Silva and Neymar. I wonder what they're feeling right now. Disappointed not to be playing. But I tell you what, they'll be part of them thinking, you know what. I am so glad I am not out there. Booth and Gears hardly surprising from the Brazilian fans to greet the half-time whistle, which is an incredible scoreline in Belo Horizonte. A Brazil-0, Germany 5. Brazil shrug off the field. High fives for the Germans. But this is certainly one of those occasions to say I was there, Janney Mills. Unbelievable. I can see half these Brazilians not coming back for second half. A bit like the team haven't turned up in the first half. I think the fans might just go home. Drown their sorrows. You know, we're seeing now, it's been pictured on the monitors in front of us. People in floods of tears. This will hurt them more. Anything else. Ah, it's just... It really is unbelievable. Speechless. We never saw anything like this coming. You wouldn't expect this in a group game, would you, Mark? It's our job to talk out loud, as we're reminded all the time, but it's hard to know what to say. It is quite the most extraordinary sporting thing I think any of us have ever seen. Five-wheel down at half-time. Chris Waddle the other day said this is the worst Brazilian side he's ever seen. But I bet you even Chris wouldn't have thought of this scoreline. I mean, it is. You're having to pull your jaw off the floor. We talked about, didn't we, that they might get beaten. It might be 2-1, it might be 3-1 at worst, maybe. There'll be the excuse that Neymar wasn't there, Tiago Silva wasn't there. And we thought, well, okay, you can see this going either way. Germans we know are very, very good and cool and calm and collected. Lots of passion from the Brazilians. We saw that in the first 10, 15 minutes. And then five-nil down in a World Cup semi-final. Just absolutely staggering. The last team to score five in a World Cup semi-final were Brazil, ironically. In 1958. And I think as you've mentioned here, they're going to lose in a competitive match at home for the first time since 1975 when Peru beat them. But to be beaten in this match, to be absolutely humiliated in this manner. Mike Higgin, what are your thoughts before we bring in Julio Gomez, who's very bravely come back to speak to us? Mike, what are your thoughts? Well, I'm trying to put it into a World Cup context, but actually, Mark, I'm putting it into a football context. I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like this before. Not even in the Premier... I remember Manchester United running right one day against Arsenal, and Arsenal are sitting just behind us, by the way. I think they were five-nil. But this is the semi-final of the World Cup. And the only thing I can think of that had the same effect on me as a teenager, really, was watching that North Korean team at Goodison Park go into a three-nil lead. And then, of course, Eusebio just said, I'm not having this and took over. But there's been all this talk about Pele in 1962, with Neymar being injured, and of course Pele was injured in 1962. Brazil still went on to win the World Cup. But of course, that Brazilian team had got the likes of Garencha, Zagalo, Dede and Vava, as well as Amarillo, who came in. So it's not comparable. Brazilian lady, we just saw the monitor, is on the phone, and she's in absolute floods of tears. Julia, thank you for coming back. Speak if you can. Look, this is a shocking moment. And I think, and I'm very, I'm almost alone in this thought here in Brazil. Brazilian football needs it. Brazilian football needs this. Humiliation at home. So we change everything. Everything is being done wrong in this country when it comes to football. Youth football, local league, the way players behave, the way players are trained, the way coaches don't go abroad to take information, exchange information and all that. We sit in five titles and always thought it would sort out our problems. When, if a British man comes, not to me, but to a Brazilian friend saying, oh, you should be doing this, this and that, a Brazilian would reply, well, I've got five stars in my jersey, and you've got one end of discussion. This is not how it goes. Football evolved, and Brazilian football needs to evolve. The only thing I really hope is that this humiliation changes things here in Brazil. I don't know if it's going to happen, but I truly hope it does. Everything you've just said about Brazilian football is what we say about English football. You realise that? The way the players are coached, they've got five, you've got to say. At least in the semi-final. Yeah, yeah. We only made it two games in. We have the players. We have too many people, we have 200 million people in a country. The only thing people do when the kids play ball. So obviously, you always have good players, and they will always go to... This is the European team. This is Brazil, Europe. I mean, they all play there. They all learned how to play football there. You see, it has nothing to do with Brazilian football. So we have to change things here in this country. If we don't, yeah, we're still going to win one World Cup here, one semi-final here and there, because obviously the players are good. But I hope this shocking moment will change things here in the country. Let me just ask you one very, very briefly. This is a serious question. Do you expect trouble here tonight? No, I don't. No. No, I just don't. I expect tears. Well, there are plenty of them already. Just Mark Chapman, let me read you this tweet, which is quite funny. Alfonso says, well, at least when any team gets a drumming this season, the fans could truthfully sing, it's just like watching Brazil. Well, let me via Amy Lawrence read one back to you. Mark, you mentioned not having seen anything like it, maybe, not even in the Premier League, but Amy. Yeah, there's a tweet here from Red Action Gunners, who found a tweet from earlier on in the tournament saying, this is like watching Arsenal in the 12.45am kick-off. I saw that as well, and I did think it was quite similar. It was like watching Arsenal at Stanford Bridge or at Abfield. That will be back with Mark and the team there shortly. Amy and Tim Vickery and Rafael Honigstein are in the studio here in Rio with us this evening. A Rafael Honigstein who couldn't relax, maybe, until it was 4-0. And he's sat now, watching the replays. You're not going to get any sense out of it. He's just watching the goals. He's watching the replays on the monitor that we have in the studio. Can you talk in amongst the grinning? I'll try. It's just so hard to relate to a game which turned on one or two minutes. I thought Germany started badly for Brazil were up for it. They looked sharp. They pressed. Germany couldn't keep the ball. I think Mesut Uzil, the first four balls that went to him, he lost all of them. There was no rhythm, nothing. Then there was this key challenge, you remember, from Filipe Blanc? Yeah. Yes. Which, very rightly, was given as a... And Marcelo appealed for a penalty, but it was a cracking tackle. As a corner, I think. And from the corner on the other side, Germany scored, and then the game opened up completely. And Brazil collapsed. And I think if ever you needed a demonstration of the importance of psychology, even at this level, this is the game. I think they completely lost themselves on that pitch. Tim Vickery. I think this shows that confidence is never an abstract. Confidence always reflects your own perception of your ability to carry out a certain task. And yes, Brazil, as they did in the Confederations Cup, very quick out of the blocks, full of brio. But the test of a team always, always, always is when you go a goal down. And as soon as they went a goal down, the balloon was pricked. And they absolutely fell apart. The defence was Fred Karno in his army. I can't recall seeing a top international side defend worse than Brazil have done. And I thought Julo Gomez in his comments was absolutely magnificent. That's exactly what you were saying to us. Yes. And as a Brazil fan, I feel very sorry for these players because a humiliation plays really big in this part of the world. And these players will live with this humiliation for the rest of their careers. But look, taking the wide of you on Brazilian football, this could not possibly be better. In order to change, and Brazilian football is operating so far below its potential, it's untrue. In order to change, they need something like this to stop that arrogance of we've won it five times because that was then, this is now. Kerr just talked about what they touched on it in Belo Horizonte. But our studio at the moment looks out over the Copacabana. It has rained since just before kickoff. Myself and Amy put a couple of pictures on social media to be able to see of it lashing down. So there aren't that many people out there on the beach. As I look out of our window, stretches down the Copacabana towards the fan fest, I can see an awful lot of flashing red lights. Probably police vehicles. There might be the odd fire engine in there as well. I have to say, they don't look as numerous as they did on the opening night after Brazil beat Croatia and there were protests outside our TV studio. So at this stage, it's probably impossible to guess what the reaction will be at full time. But it would appear that the police are gearing themselves up to make sure that nothing comes down from the fan fest towards this end. Sure. And the reaction, to be honest, no one can really predict. Because we've never been in this situation before. And as Julius said, he thinks there will be more tears than anything else. I agree. But I also think, certainly, myself, after our transmission, I'm going home. I'm going home. As a foreigner, I'm keeping my head down tonight. Right. And what should we do the same? Yes, please do. Let's get a BBC News update and then we will be back for the second half. Goodness only knows what that is going to bring. As it stands at halftime, Brazil nil, Germany five, in a World Cup semi-final. Here's Alison Hughes. On digital, online, smartphone and tablet, this is BBC Five Live. The most senior civil servant at the Home Office has admitted the department probably destroyed most of its 114 missing files, which could shed some light on historical allegations of child abuse. But Mark Sedwell told the Home Affairs Select Committee there was a record of the names of the files. Keith Vaz as the committee's chairman. I have asked Mr Sedwell to go back and at the very least, look at the list of the titles of the files. So they still retain the names of the files, but they don't have the files themselves. So if he could do that, that will just give us an indication of whether or not they're serious and relevant. But this is a very chaotic department. Israel has authorised the military to call up 40,000 reservists and says it isn't ruling out a ground invasion of Gaza. The country's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says Israel is not eager for war, but wants to stop the rocket attacks. Palestinian officials say 15 people have died in Gaza after a day of Israeli air raids. Yolande Nel is in Gaza City. Well, at the moment, the message is very much one of defiance from the militant groups here in Gaza. We heard volleys of rockets being fired off in the direction of Israel, and we're getting lots of claims coming through from militant groups that they're managing to reach areas that they haven't previously been able to reach. The leader of a trek to the Arctic, in which a 17-year-old from Salisbury was killed by a polar bear, says he gouged the bear's eyes during the attack. Michael Reed told an inquest he fought the animal when his rifle failed to fire. Two British men who went to Syria to join rebel fighters have pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. Nahin Ahmed and Yusuf Sawa, both from Birmingham, admitted preparing to carry out terrorist acts. They'll be sentenced in the next few weeks. And the British Chambers of Commerce is warning the Bank of England against a premature rise in interest rates. Manufacturing output fell by 1.3% in May, the first drop in six months. BBC Radio 5 Live, the home of Brazil, 2014. It is the first World Cup semi-final here at Brazil, 2014, between the host nation and Germany. Thomas Muller gave the Germans the lead in the 11th minute, and they're followed five minutes of madness. Tony Kruse has got it, it's gone into the area to Muller, and there's a chance for Closer. Great save from Cesar, but Closer's there! Second time round to break Ronaldo's record. Against all teams, he's done it against Brazil, and is there any way back now for the hosts? Larm is forward on the right-hand side, Muller's missed it. Kruse with a shot, there's the third goal! And in a stadium that he's sulting yellow, a black cloud. Looms large. Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable. Defensive line for Brazil, and absolute shambles. And if you were giving points out of 10 so far, you might give Fernandinho one for putting his shirt on the right way round. Here is Kedira, Kedira back to Kruse, it's the second goal! Brazil are capitulating, and the Germans are romping their way through to the final in the American R. Brazil nil, Germany four, unbelievable. They're in again here, Germany. This is Kedira, he's got options, he's pulled the ball back to Erzl. Here is Kedira again, and Kedira strokes the ball in right footed. Germany are running riots, Brazil nil. Germany five, we haven't even played half an hour. In all the World Cups I've covered, this is absolutely unprecedented. Well, that's what happened in the first half. The teams are out early for the second 45 minutes. I dread to think what the reaction was for the Brazilian players, Mark Pugach, when they came back out. They got booed, Mark, they got booed. Only about six or seven of them came out. There's an old man clasping a replica of the World Cup, and he's about a cap size in tears. There have been several substitutions from both sides, Mike Kingham, after the worst 45 minutes in Brazilian football history. Thank you, Mark. I think I said at the start of the game you could feel the tension of the occasion. Actually, you can't now because it's all over, really, but damage limitation may be for Brazil in the second half. Let me tell you about the changes that Brazil have made. Fernandinho, as suggested by Tim Vickery, really, he's made way for Paulinho. And Enrique has come on for Hult. We'll just wait and see exactly how he's going to play, where he'll play. I'll give you the revised Brazilian lineup in a moment. The Germans have also made a change. Mertesak has come on for Hummels. And maybe if Hummels has got a slight injury or something, they're now going to preserve him for the final. So it's Ramirez who's come on, not Enrique. Sorry, Ramirez. So that's more logical, because Ramirez can play in that wide position and help out in midfield. Which is interesting. Mike Palinio has just come on, put his hands together, looked up to the sky and prayed. We know this is a very, very religious country. They believe in God. They look to God for an awful lot of things. But to get back in this game is even beyond the miracle now. It's just absolutely staggering. And the action afterwards is going to be very, very interesting to see what happens. That's just sad. All around the nation, there would have been fireworks ready to go tonight. And the way that they have in this tournament, each Brazilian goal celebrated with the fireworks. But I know it's raining in Rio, and it really is a complete and utter damp squib here in Belo Horizonte. So this revised Brazilian line-up in the second half, trailing 5-0, is Giulio Cesar in goal, Maicon, Luis Dante and Marcelo. We'll just break off here as Paolino for the first time gets possession by the corner flag. Brazil playing from right to left in this second half. Plays the ball into Ramirez, switched back to Marcelo once more. Into the penalty area. Ramirez tried to get a shot in. He shovels it all along the ground, and Murdersaka makes his first contribution. So we've got Palinio Gustavo, we've got Ramirez, Oscar Bernad and Fred. And, well, Bernhard hardly got the ball at all in that first half. And yet, if you weren't with us in the first five minutes or so, before Thomas Moura scored after 11 minutes, we thought the Germans were rattled. They seem to be making mistakes. They were giving the ball away. The crowd may be getting at them, because it was a wonderful, wonderful start for Brazil in terms of atmosphere. And without really creating very much, I have to say early on Brazil seemed to have the Germans rattle, but then the goals came flowing in. And the German team is Neuer, Lamm, Bote, Murtisakar and Hovades, Schweinsteiger and Kedira, Moller, Krus, Herzl and Kloser. You're listening to Five Live. We've played two minutes of the second half, and it is just really sad now for the host nation. Five goals in 29 minutes. Blumfontain revisited in terms of England memories, I remember four years ago. And this nation is going to suffer massive withdrawal symptoms. Huge hangover tomorrow in particular. Five nil to Germany, and Brazil and Denis were saying, the record defeat for Brazil is six nil in 1920 by Uruguay. The problem I think we identified early on here, though, was you're going to have a full back like Marcelo rampaging forward in the way that Roberto Carlos used to. In Scolari's team, when Roberto Carlos was going forward, you had people like Cleverson and Gilberto Silva immediately tracking back to help and to cover the back three that they left behind. But that was non-existent, and of course, Muller was the perfect man to really exploit that situation. The ball is down the Brazilian right. Mijkoz ball in towards Fred. Germany defend. Oscar picks the ball up, and then falls easily after the challenge from Boateng. And the ball is back on the halfway line once more with the host nation. Ball played forward, looking for Fred once more. Fred also goes to ground very cheaply there against Mertesaker, and the ball's gone behind for a German goal. Kick, no way to take. Danny, a lot of empty seats. I think a lot of people either have gone to the bar and drowning their sorrows. They're not coming back for the second half. But also now, Holland and Germany, sorry, Holland and Argentina must be looking at this thinking, wow. You know, not only have Germany now got an easy second half, the players will be very, very fresh. They didn't have to work massively hard. Apart from that first 15-minute spell, then it was easy for them. So they are going to be well rested. They'll be very, very fresh for the final. And also, we've seen how devastating the clinical they are. Those are Argentina and Holland will be thinking, wow, yes, we want to get to the final, but we're going to have to go all out and play the better than we've ever played to be this German side. It no longer feels like a World Cup semi-final. It's 5-0 to Germany, and they were leading 5-0 after 20 to nine minutes of the first half. You're listening to Five Live. Mertesak, who's come on to equal Franz Beckenbauer's 103 caps, lifts the ball forward, and then it's uncharacteristically given away by Germany. And Brazil just looking for, I was going to say crumbs of comfort, but nothing will comfort them. Absolutely no consolation at all. David Luiz now crosses the half-way line. Luiz with the ball on to Ramirez. Ramirez, and that pass was misplaced to Marcello down the left-hand side. Bernard offers his services. The ball goes in, and there's an opportunity maybe for Paulinho, but immediately the Germans smother around Paulinho. Ball lifted into the far post. And Neuer, I think he touched that, but it's been kept in by Erzl. And what a great ball out of defence by Mesut Erzl. Miroslav closer, by the way, in the first half, has now gone past Ronaldo with his 16 goals at World Cup finals. But Danny's saying now we expect Muller on 10 goals to at least go past that. Ball played up now towards Oscar. Fred lays it to Ramirez. Ramirez's shot may find Fred on the edge of the area. He releases Ramirez. Ramirez cut back, diving save from Neuer. Just about the first real save he's had to make. Erzl keeps the ball in over on the far side by the corner flag, and then Botein completes the clearance. And it was caught late as well as he released that ball. But the referee continues the game, closer dances around a few challenges. Muller's there, it's tight over on the far side. Brazil have the ball again. Lifted forward by Luiz. Header back by Philippe Larm, and Neuer will come out of his area. And then lift the ball as far as he can, away from his penalty area, back into the Brazilian half. Well, Brazil should have scored then. Ramirez down the right-hand side, got in a really good position. And he was played in by Fred, I think it was. Went to cut the ball back across goal for Oscar. But even Ramirez, he was not in the first half. No belief, no conviction about that pass. And a simple push out, if you like, for Neuer in the end. Five-mil to Germany, at least Asia to the second half. And just the record, by the way, I'm going to say that I was disappointed that they didn't at least put a picture of Alfredo de Stefano up here to show the crowd, because I know he wasn't identified with the World Cup, but he was one of the game's great players, and he sadly passed away yesterday. That should have been recognised here tonight. Here now, Ramirez, ball in the area, save by Neuer. And nothing is dropping Brazil's way. Nobody there, Fred wasn't there to follow up. Erzal having to play as a left back at the moment. And you can understand the Germans in many ways now. It's cruise control for them, isn't it? They know that there's no way back here for the opposition. And they're really just... I don't know how ambitious they're going to be in the second half, Danny. Well, they won't need to be ambitious at all. But they'll get a couple of chances, it's just where they take them. But bizarrely, Brazil couldn't score two already. Ramirez got in, then they're out on the side, couldn't cut the ball back for Oscar. And Oscar should have put that ball away. You know, simple. But the only... Ten yards from goal. Only countries to score against Germany in this tournament. The African countries, Algeria and Ghana, but here come Brazil again. But Germany seem to be quite happy to allow them to have the ball. Bernard's in the area. Challenge came in from Muller. And the corner kick is given. A replacement ball immediately thrown to Bernard. We've played seven and a half minutes at the second half. We've now got two balls on the field. One is cleared. Bernard will take this corner. Brazil have made two changes at halftime. Dante by Munich, making his way to the far post. In goes the corner kick. Noia gets a really good fist to it. Might drop to Marcelo, who gets the head of Ozil. Marcelo looking to set up a shot, but Schweinsteiger immediately comes in with a great challenge. And here come the Brazilians once more. Paulinho in the area. Paulinho shot straight at Noia. Paulinho again. Noia makes another save. And comes to the referee and complains about something. How good is Manuel Noia? Fabulous. Paulinho was on the side. Short corner taken. Marcelo over on that far side. Digs the ball back to Maicon. Maicon now taking it forward as far as Ozil will allow him. And then there's a misplaced pass from him. So Manuel Noia who made that wonderful save against Benzema at the end of the quarterfinal in Rio stands up firm once more for the Germans here tonight. It's a brilliant double save, Mike. The first one, he stood tall, strong. The ball almost hit him. Came back to Paulinho again. Just a little flick with his left hand. But such a strong arm that he's got. Puts his hand up and the ball bounces like 30, 40 yards away. Noia is absolutely immense. Bernard at least is trying a few flicks down this left hand side, trying to get the crowd lifted. But it's an impossible job. And now Germany with a great ball out of defense. Find Muller down this right hand side. In comes Luis Gustavo and the challenge has been penalized. And it's a free kick to Germany just inside the Brazil high. Just noted David Louise. He's gone from centre half and he's ran 40 yards up the field to try and close down with field players for Germany. Now Muller down the German right. Muller's beefy ball to the far side. And I suppose, I hope this isn't going to sound cruel, but maybe we've seen here tonight, why perhaps Jose Mourinho hasn't retained the services of David Louise as a defender. Well, quite possible because he wasn't disciplined enough. He lost his concentration, got wrapped up in the moment. And you can't do that. You've got to have, you know, fire in your belly, you know, but ice in your head. That's not the sort of player that he is. And obviously, I'm 40, 50 million euros, whatever it was, it's probably a good price for him. Jochim Lowe, I think, would have said at half time, keep yourselves out of trouble. Don't overdo anything. Don't overstretch for anything. You know, you can see the goal, not a problem. Keep yourselves fit, stay out of trouble, and just then, you know, just see the game out. This is five-life, and Marcelo has the ball for Brazil down this left hand side of the field, and then it's a topoker, which Oscar will not get. If you're just joining us, what is it back home? 10 pass, 10 in the evening. This is the score line. Well, where have you been for one? Well, this is the score line. Brazil nailed Germany five, and this is the World Cup semi-final, and I have never seen balloons punctured to the extent that they were here this evening. I've never seen an atmosphere in a stadium subside the way it did here. The Brazilians came out to unbelievable support. Never heard an anthem sing as sung as loudly as it was here, and they started okay, and the Germans looked as if they were a bit affected by the occasion. But then once Muller stroked them into a lead, unmarked, following a corner, well, then the goals came from closer, that record 16th at the World Cup, two from Croce, and then Kedira. Five-nil to Germany, and I think now it's very safe to say that the 2014 World Cup final will be Germany against either Argentina or Holland. Could be an all-European final, or it could be for the third time in a World Cup final, Germany against Argentina, one-one in the previous finals. Muller now down the left-hand side, Erzels there, just inside, lovely running again from Muller. Croce is looking interested. Muller's going to run towards the dead ball line, and try and pull this ball back for closer. Damn it, he's all knocked it back to goalkeeper. Giulio says, ah, and just about got away with that one. And as Brazil move forward, Joachim Lowe, even though he's leading five-nil, is still conducting his team down below. Out comes Neuer, and he got there first ahead of Ramirez, looked to be body checks, and then the referee's going to make a great song and dance of it, though. He's just going to give the free kick. Yeah, Manuel Neuer won the free kick, got tripped up, did 17 rollovers, but then to be fair to him, did jump up straight away. Now, you know, you talk about how seriously will Germany take this second half. Well, I tell you what, Muller's on, what, five goals now. Obviously, how many Rodriguez out of the tournament on six? I'm sure. Muller won the goal, but last one now. Yes, he did, yes, he did with five. Has anybody ever won it? Twice in a row? Twice in a row. Well, at the moment, he's got that incentive, obviously, his lamb now playing it right back, and he does look so much better. And he's great in midfield, but he is exceptional at right back, and now Scherler of Chelsea is going to come into the game, and he's going to replace Closar. Well, Closar's got his 16th World Cup finals goal. And remember, he played in that 2002 final in Yokohama. The Brazilian team on that occasion was much stronger than this Brazilian team, and the German team on that occasion, nothing like as strong as this German team. So, Closar's replaced by Scherler. Scherler, who's given the Germany side good service in this World Cup, coming on for the last half an hour, always a threat, and he's going to run hard at this Brazilian defence, and maybe cause even more anxiety around the stadium. Diving header away by Germany. Brazil regroup in midfield with Paulinho. Paulinho now for Luis Gustavo. That ball towards Marcelo is a bit short, and then as he drifts in field, he's caught by Scherler. But I mean, everything is... The bottom has just dropped out of this semi-final, in terms of anticipation and expectation, and everything that we were looking forward to really here today. This is so one-sided and so sad for the host nation, as the ball is played in. And the other thing is, Danny, in the aftermath of all of this, I mean, most of the talk is going to be about Brazil, but I wonder how much credit Germany are going to get for turning them over here in such a way tonight? Well, they've been incredible. They've just sort of epitomised everything that German football is about. She would do chance from Fred, but he doesn't really get anything on it at all. Straight at Muller, and there are immediately boos around the stadium, because I think that they thought Fred could have had more of a stab at that one. Kedira moving forward, already now, nearly 15 minutes gone in the second half, and the ball is through to Scherler. He won't chase that, because I think he would have been offside, and the ball is back with... Julio says, ah, the goalie. Just checking, Mike. No-one's ever won the Golden Boot twice in a row. Well, cut, obviously. Muller needs one more goal to... Oh, given away! And he goes to Muller looking for another goal, and he goes round the goalkeeper. No, he doesn't, because Julio Cesar managed to get something on the ground there, and Germany have to settle for the corner kickover on the far side. Just like no-one's done it twice, Muller nearly put himself in prime position to do that. So my able, glamorous assistant Ian Dennis was looking up. It only went back to 1978, so we needed the internet for a little bit of extra help. Well, he's one short at the moment of Rodriguez, the Colombian who leads with six at this tournament, short corner for Germany, leading by five goals to nil. Ball is played back to Schveinsteiger on the edge of the area. Now Kedira. Muller's looking interested once more inside that penalty area. Ball goes back to Kedira. Muller's pointing, give it to me to my feet here. Kedira, instead, though, finds Tony Kruse. Tony Kruse now onto Muller, edge of the area. Militant shot on! And Julio Cesar turns it away, one-handed for a corner kicker. Now, I think that just amplifies everything we've been saying about Thomas Muller. Fabulous player. Left foot, right foot. He gets himself in a little bit of space, just turned. He's just tried to bend the ball into the top corner. In the end, it was a fabulous save. Another short corner to Germany, five-nil they lead. Ball played forward and then given away this time by Germany. And it'll be brought out from the back by Dante. And Dante just hoops the ball towards the halfway line. Bernard does well in the air, gets above Lawn. Fred's slow to control that, but then eventually gets it. And the crowd of Bullying Fred here, there's a question about that. Fred is getting some grief from the crowd here. And Oscar, I'm not quite sure why they're targeting him in particular, because nobody down there has done themselves any favours tonight in the Brazil side. It's Bernard now, down the left. Krosk comes Schveinsteiger, Schöler rather. The ball is played into David Luiz, who got that thrilling goal, of course, in the last round. Ball chipped into Maicon in the penalty area. Maicon tries to bring it down, takes the tumble, again looking for a penalty. Germans complaining, corner kick is given only. And I think the Germans are just saying to the referee, that was another dive, probably the third in the second half. The Brazilians are getting desperate. Oscar's got a corner over on the far side. What do you think of that? Well, Brazilian players are trying, anytime they get the box, they go into ground far too easily. Anything for a consolation at the moment. 5-0 to Germany, corner kick to Brazil, over on the far side. A backward header by Schöler to clear. But now Bernard lifts it in, Annoyus there once more with those capable hands in the German goal. Holes onto the ball and then throws it out, gets good distance. Erzl up against Maicon. Maicon from the angle gives it back again to Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper away to the right. Well, Scolari, of course, had the stress and strain of being with the host Portugal in Euro 2004 and losing the final against Greece. That was hard for him, this is worse. As a Brazilian, he'll be feeling this. As his team go forward and the ball in is poor really towards Fred and Germany easily clear to the far side of the field. You have to remember that normally the Brazilian press conference is very, very long. I just wonder... We've just got a picture of Ronaldo, by the way there. Well, it's... Commentating here for Brazilian TV, I imagine. It's a double blow, isn't it? Because he's lost his record to Murph's life closer and he then thumps 5-0. It's just incredible now. The game has become a nothing game. Well, it's an exercise in total futility now for Brazil. Germany are quite happy with them to have the ball because Brazil keep giving it away anyway. And that's been threaded through from Marcelo, straight through to Manuel Neuer in the German goal away to our left. I mean, when England shot Germany in Munich, that was quite a stunning evening, but that was a qualifying game. That wasn't the semi-final of the World Cup. And now here we go with Paulinho for Brazil. Ramirez makes the run. Paulinho's overrun that one though and Hovhards, who hasn't missed very much at left-back clears and the ball is back once more. And still Jochen Lowe, it's him down there, not Scolari, trying to sort of keep his side going, even though they're leading 5-0. He wants a focus, I suppose, as Bernard gives chase once more. Neuer has to get back in his goal. Bernard's ball in to nobody at all, apart from the German left-back Hovhards, and that's a no-nonsense clearance from him onto the Belo Horizonte sign over on the far side. And Brazil quickly take the throw. Five live, 18.5 minutes gone in the second half. The most amazing World Cup first half here in a semi-final, with Germany going into a 5-0 lead inside half an hour. So just going back to that, Mike, normally the Brazilian press conferences an hour and a half long, we could be here all night. The post-mortem for this is not just me tonight. It's going to go on for days, for months, possibly even years. This is just so unprecedented and to happen on your home turf is just unbelievable. Here they come again, the Germans, and the ball is played into the area. Cesar will get there. And all the television channels here, from breakfast time onwards this morning, it's been wall-to-wall coverage, as you would expect, building up to this game. 200 million Brazilians hopeful, and here now goes Bernard, and it's a lost course for them. Bernard's ball lead, even that wasn't measured right to Paulinho, and then he was a little bit late, he's caught one of the German players over on the far side, and Jokam Lohr, of course, can make one more change if he wants to, and I'm sure he'll be talking to his coaching staff down there, and they'll be weighing up the fitness of all the players. They won't want to take a risk with anybody who's maybe not completely 100% fit, and Germany have a free kick. And that's why I would have said, go out there, just protect yourselves. Don't get injured, do things the simple way, don't overstretch him in any way, shape or form, and just go out and be sensible, even if you concede a goal. Don't concern yourselves. The most important thing for Germany now is the final. Well, this World Cup began with a Brazilian-owned goal, which is turning out to be quite symbolic now, because Marcelo put through his own goal against Croatia in the opening game, but then Neymar in particular got them back with two goals, 3-1 victory. They had a few lucky breaks as well along the way in that game. So, symbolically, this Brazilian World Cup began with a Brazilian-owned goal, and this is where it's going to end, in the stadium where it ended for England, of course, against Costa Rica. Long ball forward, very different circumstances, though. Again, Fred making a negligible contribution. Now, battles back, and he's still being booed by the fans here. Mike on down the right-hand side, into midfield, and Ramirez. Ramirez is just being hustled by Schweinsteiger there, as if it's still nil-nil. I mean, Schweinsteiger wasn't going to allow him to go through. Louise again. There'll be a lot of debate, too, I'm sure, about now. hindsight's a wonderful thing, whether all the right players were here for Brazil. Rebenio, for example, was left out, and people like Coutinho, Liverpool, when they were even near it. And now, Germany again, left-hand side. That's a fantastic ball. Schweinsteiger might have got it. Scherler might get it instead. Julio Cesar does well, comes out of his area, and Scherler shakes his fist. He thought he might have had a chance there of Germany's sixth goal, and Brazil now moving it down this left-hand side. At least from Brazil's point of view, there's been nothing more to stun them in this second half, as the ball is played into the penalty area. It won't come down for them. Now it's lifted in, Murdersack is header, and there's a flag up over on the far side. So the bicycle kick was in vain. The bicycle kick came from Paulinho, and it's going to be a free kick to Germany. And, well, it's not quite the halfway point of the second half, but I think it's actually quite a good moment, as there's a break in play here. I wonder whether Ney and Dennis is going to describe a record defeat for Brazil. Remember, 6-0 is that record scoreline in 1920. Over to you, Ian. I've worked quite closely with Mike over the last five years, covering England, and over the last five years, I've been quite reliant on him. And I'm going to have to ask for one last favour. Could I borrow your stopwatch? Because mine is a little bit like the Brazilian defence. It's stopped working. Thank you, Mike, and not just for the stopwatch. If you want to interact, then we're more than welcome to receive your texts and tweets here on 5 Live, your World Cup station. We do try and pride ourselves on being interactive. Here are a couple, not who have gone into 5 Live, but Josie Altador, all jokes aside, this is crazy. Hope Brazil can get a couple back. Hate to see the host nation go down like this. And Piers Morgan. And I'll pre-empt this by saying I'll make no other comment once I've read out his tweet. I'd back Brazil to win, Fred to score, and declared Louis my man of a tournament. I feel a complete and utter prat. 5 Live, we're with you here until the end of this game. And when we were last here, of course, it was a complete dead rubber. England against Costa Rica. England were already going out. And ever since that fifth goal's gone in, we've had another hour of another dead rubber in Belo Horizonte. But even England's defence was better than this. I'm not sure... Well, they might have been beaten fire by Germany, but certainly probably not in the first 30 minutes. Here is Laam for Germany. Red and Hoopt. Red and Black Hoopt strike shirts. Laam into the penalty area. Low ball, pulsing. There is the goal from Scherler. And it is a record-equalling defeat for Brazil since 94 years. Brazil nil. Germany six. It is a night nobody will ever forget. Frightening. Knife through hot butter, doesn't even describe it. You can now hear all the fans around the stadium, every single one of them booing. They are absolutely outraged. There was four defensive players in and around Scherler, and he just went, no. Well, there's been pockets of descent during the second half. The stewards in their luminous orange and yellow jackets have had to intervene on two or three occasions. There was sporadic fighting high up a way to our right, which was quickly nipped in the bud. But I do fear that it is going to turn and continue to turn sour. Because, William is on for Brazil. Germany's record world-cut win, by the way, was against Saudi Arabia in the group stages of 2002. That was eight nil. It is six nil. It is an unbelievable score line, and will send shockwaves throughout world football. Brazil totally and utterly humiliated. Paulinho, to their credit, you know, there are still so many yellow shirts inside this stadium. That holds just under 57,500. Call me fickle, but I'd have gone a long time by now. Floated over. Brazil looking for the consolation, and it was Marcelo who has been exposed time and time again. And Arsene Vanguino, who's commentating for French TV, said these Brazilian players will be traumatised for life. And Germany coming forward. Kadeira. Erzal over on that far side. Scherler again. Sorry, it would cross this time. It got round the back of Marcelo. They are incredibly open still at the back. They've given up. We've just seen a very dejective thread on the sideline. He was taken off for William coming on, and they purely to save him from any more embarrassment. Every time he touched the ball, he was getting massive cheers and booze, and I think Scolari said, you know, that's not nice. The only way to sum it up, I think, and I think Mike said it earlier, it's actually quite sad. Here is William. We'll get the thoughts of Tim Vickeringer moment. William, who's a substitute, goes for a curling effort. Tim, 1920, was the last time that Brazil suffered a 6-0 defeat against Uruguay. Your thoughts, please. Very, very sad for these players. There'll be an orgy of self-hatred now over the next few days. Remember, this team will have to play again on Saturday. Straight afterwards, next week, the Brazilian championship resumes. So the focus will be back on club football very, very soon. I hope that doesn't mean that Brazilian football just looks at it, it stares at its own belly button. I hope that this defeat will have wide-ranging effects because Brazilian football is operating ludicrously below its potential. Well, nobody, of course, ever wants to play in a third-fourth-place playoff after the disappointment of losing the semi-final. But will any Brazilians turn up for that? That would be my question. I think they'll be so disenchanted with their team, so despondent. You can hear the booze ringing round at the moment. I'm not sure that, even those with tickets might go, you know what, it was so embarrassing to play, don't deserve our support. Here is Murtisaka to Scherler. You can only admire the Germans, by the way. I know a lot of the focus has been on Brazil and quite rightly so with the scoreline, maybe, because it is totally astonishing. But the Germans have been fantastic. They're into an eighth World Cup final. And you look at their record, since Euro 2004, when they failed to get out of the group stages, and they failed to reach the last four of a World Cup or Euro since. I know it's 18 years since they last won a major tournament, Euro 96. But for tournament football, Rafa Honegstein, it's an incredible record. And one, there's some more fighting, I think he's just breaking out on that right-hand side, the stewards are getting involved. Rafa, you'll never have a better opportunity to end that 18-year wait. That is true, although with every goal, Germany's score here, the pressure just becomes bigger on them. After Nervy 1-0 or 2-1 after penalties or that sort of result, you wouldn't have necessarily such a clear favourite. Now, whatever Argentina and Netherlands will do, Germany will go in this game with a feeling that they've only can throw it away. And I think that's very dangerous. I mean, maybe I'm being a bit a little bit too German, you're seeing already the negatives after a 6-0 win against Brazil. But of course, it does increase the pressure on Nervy. And it'll be a nice result to remember, but it'll count for very, very little if they don't win the World Cup. And that is a serious point. Well, the one thing that they do have in their favour is huge experience. Tally of the Brazilian starting line-up was 406 caps. Brazil with Laam, Schweinsteiger and Kloser, 3 centurions was 352. Kroos has scored a couple of goals, is actually making his 50th appearance tonight for his country. And with that, there's actually another five players with 50 or more caps. This is a German squad that has so much experience. And I remember being in Sweden when they beat England England in the under-21 championships by four goals to nil. And six of those players are in this squad here for World Cup 2014. And one of England's gripes is about player progression. On that night in Malmo, England had Martin Craney and Michael Mansion. Where are they now? We know where the Germans are. They're romping their way through to the World Cup final of American art, with 15 minutes remaining. Germany are leading by six goals to nil against the host nation, who have suffered their heaviest defeat since 1920. So 94 years. Oh, this is going to hurt. They wanted to so exercise the ghosts of 1950 and losing the final to Uruguay. Well, not going to happen. It's going to be a night that will haunt them, a new generation of Brazilian supporters for many, many years to come. Here is Louise flicking the ball over the head of Schweinsteiger. Schweinsteiger recovers, brings him down free kick. Germany are going to make a change. Jenny Mills. Well, I think Germany now just going to see the game out. You said the substitutes about to be made is actually Schweinsteiger. It's actually Schweinsteiger that's going to come off. I just listened to you talk about those statistics. Now, you stopped counting up to three or three players adding up those numbers. 719 caps, I think Germany started with at the beginning of this game, compared to Brazil's 406. The experience that they have, and the average age of the players now, at around about 24, 25, all these players are just about hitting their peak. And just to wrap you honestly, I think the disappointment now will be from Germany. If they don't want to win this, because these players, they are in their prime. They've proved, you know, at their clubs, they are exceptional. They've now proved here this evening that they are worthy winners of a World Cup. Now, they've got to go out and prove it. I was fluttered earlier to be called your glamorous assistant, but maths has never been my strong point. That's why I stopped at 352. Although your Portuguese, I have to say, has been very, very good and has been well worked on this trip, has saved us on more than one occasion, getting us into a restaurant. I have my uses. Julian Draxler is on for Samir Kedira. It's his first appearance of this tournament, the Schalke player. It's his 12th appearance for his country. Lula has just been told to get away. I think there was a wild swing by Luiz that he reacted to. I asked for your texts and tweets. Upbeat Trick has sent Germany proving to the world. Brazil just aren't very good. It's a well-oiled German machine tearing up a rusty shell-shot Brazil. Adam Carter, 1985. OK, this is humiliating for Brazil. Unbelievable, incredible. And Hamnest, take Neuer off. He could do with the rest. Football justice. The worst Brazil side ever. This was coming not 5-0, though. Well, if you missed it, since that was sent, they've added another. 6-0, 5-live, your World Cup station in 2014. Tomorrow night, Sao Paulo, the two-hour build-up to Argentina against Holland. It certainly will not be as one-sided as this. And then Sunday's final in the Maracanar at 8. And do not forget to miss my King and the World Cup years. Friday at 9. And Sunday repeated at 1. Looking back on his 8th World Cup tournament. Have I dropped a faux pas? I think he said, do not forget to miss. Oh, do not. It's been a long tournament, but don't worry, I'm going home tomorrow. He'll give me another kick under the table. I've had a few of those on this tournament. I've had a few over the last five years, to be fair, from Mike. Don't forget to listen to Mike's World Cup years. That's what I meant. I think that's what we need to say. I'm shell shot like the rest of them. I'm not Brazilian. Anyway, you got the drift. I think the German fans are actually genuinely shocked as well. Scherler has added a second for himself. And now Germany have scored seven. And it is the heaviest defeat in Brazil's history. Brazil's illustrious history. And the herd continues on a night when the nation of Brazil is totally humiliated. It is a complete another night there. And it is a scoreline which the Germans cannot believe. And the Brazilians cannot believe. Brazil, nil. Germany, seven. And Andre Scherler with a left-footed shot in off the underside of the crossbar. What a fantastic strike. It was just lobbed back in to the edge of the box. He was running through, took it, smashed it in at the near post. On off the other side. U-Laces are absolutely no chance. The Brazilians are giving up on him. David Luiz couldn't chase him anymore. And the celebrations were almost apologetic. Even the German fans were shaking their heads going, is this real? You know, euphoric for them. But they should, no one in their wildest dreams. I don't think would have put a bet on Germany winning by three clear goals, four clear goals at the very, very most. Seven, just, well, we are literally speechless. Well, now they're heading for the exits of the Brazilians supporters. I was slow to pick up the goal because I'd actually just been handed a note which said the biggest World Cup semi-finals wins. Well, it now eclipses all of these previous score lines that are going to give you because this is the biggest margin in a World Cup semi-final. Eclipsing Argentina sixth, the United States one, and Uruguay sixth, Yugoslavia one in 1930. And West Germany sixth, one victory against Austria in 1954. Shot comes in from Marcelo on the edge of the area. That's wide. Seven, seven nil to Germany. And we have still 10 more minutes remaining. They might well yet equal their record win in a World Cup for Germans against Saudi Arabia that was eight nil. The record continues to be broken. Miroslav closer. Beating Ronaldo's record, the all-time leading scorer now in the World Cup. Brazil, the heaviest defeat in their entire history. That is remarkable in itself. You're almost, well, we are. I really don't know what to say anymore. It's seven nil. Brazil starts the OK. Germany have been exceptional. You know, they weathered the storm for that 15, 10, 15-minute spell. And then they have just been so efficient, so clinical in their play. You know, it really has been... We've concentrated a lot on Brazil and how awful they've been, especially defensively. They've been absolutely shocking. They're complete shambles at times. Germany have just controlled this. Since they went two nil up, it then became men... Not even as boys against infants. It's been that easy for them. The Brazilians are actually allaying the Germans now. The Brazilian support are allaying Germany football as they're keeping the ball and coming forward. It can't get much worse. This humiliation, this abject humiliation for Brazil. Their own supporters are allaying the opposition who are leading by seven goals to nil. For a footballing sense, I remember being at St. James's Park where Newcastle scored eight, seven or eight against Spurs. I remember Kevin Keegan feeling for Jerry Francis after the game. I didn't enjoy it after a while. He felt for his opposite number. I wonder if Joachim Lerb is feeling the same as well here because Germany with Scherler into the penalty area, cleared by Dante. I mentioned earlier in about... Put it in perspective. This is what England Moldova, five nil. England San Marino, I'm sure there's a seven nil. It's just absolutely staggering. I really cannot believe that it has got to this point. Brazil, Phil Scolari, still in the sideline now. Arms folded. Must be thinking, how on earth am I going to explain this to not just the Brazilian press, but the world press after this game. Will you hear the cliché trotted out? There are no easy games in its international football nowadays. Apart from this one. Apart from this one. We will certainly have a repeat of the previous final, whether it be 1990 in Argentina, or just West Germany winning that, of course, in Italy, or indeed the 74 final where the Germans beat Holland 2-1. Because tomorrow in Sao Paulo, Argentina against Holland, we've got six and a half minutes remaining, and Germany are coming forward. And this is Laam, and they've still got runners going on ahead of them. Scherler, who's on a hat-trick, cleared though by Gustavo towards Marcello. And Marcello will play it forward to William. They came with hopes. They came on a ride of emotion. This is why they're going. But they've been completely dismissed by the German efficiency and their own shambolic defending. Let's just about say, this might sound really odd, and maybe a bit daft, but Brazil have won this, sorry, Germany have won this, without trying that hard. Out towards that far side, Maicon. Maicon to Paulinho opens up his body, cleared away by Bote. Tomorrow we've got the first day of the first test starting at Trent Bridge. There'll be coverage on five live sports extra from 10-25. In quick as in parlance now, the Germans can easily declare, leading by seven goals to nil. Brazil are forward now, and this is with Ramirez. Ramirez will turn straight towards Neuer. They've not let up though. That's why you've got to admire the Germans. Even Neuer earlier in the second half, making those saves. They're not ease off the pedal at all. A lot of pride about the performance. They won't want to concede goals. They've taken it a little bit easy in the second half, but they've taken the whole game. They've played with such a swagger, such a confidence and an air of belief. And just sheer efficiency is what they've done. They haven't really had to work hard. They haven't had to go and close the Brazilians down. So once they got that second goal, that was it, game over. They've been in complete control ever since. Well, for Germany, they're unbeaten in their last 17 internationals now. They've won 12 and drawn five. They're going into the World Cup final in the American R on the crest of a way. Their confidence will be high. Raffer Honekstein back in studio. There will be incredible headlines tomorrow about the dream, about the miracle of a better horizon to about Germany having one and a half hands at the cup, if that's possibly an animosity possible. And they'll be waiting for whoever will be the underdog in that final. That will be the assumption in Germany. And Lerth will try his best to downplay everything. They'll say, you know, this is another game. We'll have to start again. We can't take anything for granted. But the players will go into this game with so much confidence. You know, they were shaky against Algeria. They were shaky against Ghana. But with the confidence that's come into their game, coupled with the ability, they look absolutely awesome today. Well, the thing is as well is that for Joachim Lerth, this is his fourth major finals. He's yet to taste the success and he wants to obviously change all that runner up in 2008. Third, of course, in South Africa. Beating Uruguay in that third, fourth place playoff and then semifinals in the 2012 Euros. All the headlines be back in Germany, Rapper. Well, it will be all about a result that nobody thought was possible. A result that we'll probably never see again. A seven-nil in the semifinal between the two of the best teams in World Football is something that I'm not sure we'll ever see again. To see a team fall apart and to see a team hit them with all they've got. The German supporters high up away to our right-hand side, a swaying from side to side. They're either bare-chested or wearing the white shirts. It's a night they will never forget. It's a night nobody will ever forget, whether you're actually inside the stadium of Belo Horizonte and it is far from a beautiful horizon as far as the Brazilians are concerned. Or indeed, from a German's point of view. Because they have been fantastic. Brazil have been awful. And we have two minutes of normal time remaining. And here is Merserzaka backpedaling. And Neuer, the sweeper keeper midway through the German half. Kroos forward. Just dropping to collect this ball is Julian Draxler. Playing the ball at walking pace, stroking it around, oozing with confidence. Erzal and finding the space as well. Laam towards Scherler. Louise will cover in fact, he'll leave it towards Julio Cesar, who throws it out underarm towards Marcelo. Not sure going to need your Portuguese tonight to get us a table at a restaurant. I think there might be plenty of spaces. There might be lots of empty tables. Offside trap is beaten by Oscar. Oscar across the face of goal. Won't even go out for a goal kick. He goes out of play for a throw. And there's a few more hoots of derision from the Brazilian supporters who have remained inside the stadium. And now here in Belo Horizonte, you can actually see those shades of degrees of grey of the bucket seats here. But it is not a grey night. It is a black night for Brazil. Seven-nil as a host nation. The worst thing is for them now. They've got to come out and play the third, fourth place playoff. You know, and that's going to be a horrible game for them to be involved in. Here is William. Shot comes in from Bernard, off target, left footed, high and wide. Few supporters behind that goal just throw their arms away in disgust as well. And Neuer quickly wants to take that goal kick. That was the first little bit of lazy play from Germany, picked up by Ramirez. Now the ball cannons away and there's a break-off. And all of a sudden, Germany going in search of an eight. It's played through the middle. This is Erzl. Erzl's got a chance to weigh this one up and he pulls it wide. Terrible miss from Mr. Erzl. Broke the off-side line, one-on-one with a goalkeeper on the edge of the 18-yard box, on his left foot, getting in. Just rolled this in, eight-nil. Dragged it wide. Just to put things into perspective, Brazil's first home defeat for 12 years as Oscars into the penalty area. Oscar now with the consolation. Oscar with the consolation, right footed, beach Neuer. There will be no fourth clean sheet for Germany, but it will make not one John of Difference for Brazil. They celebrate in the tamest of scenarios for Brazil. Brazil won Germany 7th. It will not alter the fact that the host nation have still been humiliated at home as two minutes have added on time here in Belo Horizonte. Germany will be a little bit disappointed with that, which is a long, hopeful ball through. But I think the cheers were ironic cheers more than anything else. I'm sorry, but it's 7-1, it's not even a consolation. Ball played forward to their first home defeat in 12 years, their first competitive defeat at home in 39 years, the heaviest defeat in a World Cup semi-final. And their record defeats in their illustrious history. Ball pulled back, Marcelo into the penalty area. And so it's William rather than Marcelo's in close proximity. There's the back heel. Bernard's sliding challenge comes from La, knowing the Germans, they'll complain about not being happy about keeping a fourth clean sheet. Well, Manuel Neuer certainly will be. You know, he's made some good saves in the second half, and he'll be bitterly disappointed as he's conceded a goal. Here is William into the penalty area, headed away then by Borteng. And that's why he got to admire them, that ruthless winning streak that they have. And Neuer now will go long, and deliberately keeps it low towards Erzl. And there's another break on here. Erzl carves the ball forward, and it's looking towards Draxler and Draxelmeitz. Now the referee's blown his whistle. I think the referee felt sorry for Luis Gustavo there. A little bit of a tangle of legs gave the free kick, and the referee ends the game. That's it. Humiliation. Brazil won, Germany 7th. Brazil's misery is complete, but it's a night that will haunt them forever. Mark Puget. Well, in 1950, when they lost the final game to Uruguay, in the Maracanar, it became known as the Maracanaso. I wonder if there's going to be a similar word here, as David Luiz is on all fours. Luis Gustavo, I think, is praying and crying. Several of the Brazilians slumped to the ground, while the Germans embrace each other. Brazil won, Germany 7th. Danny, nobody has a betting slip in the world with that on it. I don't care who they are and what they say. Nobody has a betting slip anywhere near like that on them. Not a chance. It's just been incredible. Look at the Brazilian players now. They'll feel humiliation. They'll be devastated. They'll be embarrassed. It's just unprecedented scenes. David Luiz, for about three minutes after the game, stood there, his two fingers in the air, on his knees, looking at the sky, obviously saying some sort of prayer, as you mentioned, Luis Gustavo as well. There are players down there inconsolable. I think Thiago Silva has just gone on. I think he's with Oscar. I think he's with Oscar, who's in absolute floods of tears. And I think, as Ian said, that Arsene Venger said, who's on French television, about 10 yards away from us, they will be traumatised for life by this. Danny, does that seem right? In a footballing sense, they will be traumatised forever by being part of this absolute humiliation. Completely. Because wherever you go, whatever happens, even if they go on and win the next World Cup, they will always be saying, you were part of that team. You let us down, you let yourselves down. But most importantly, you let 200 million people down. We talked about this before the game. We said, how many people will be wearing a yellow shirt or a Brazilian shirt? And we probably said maybe half the country, maybe 100 million people. Now, the Boos have started as the Brazilian team congregate in the centre circle. I wouldn't really say it's a huddle, it's a bit like they're defending, it's a bit of a mess, it's a bit of a mishmash. And Luis Felipe Scallari is having a word with Oscar. Oscar's been craved by Tiago Silva, like a father who knows that his son is very, very upset. There were some Boos, there's still some whistles, now the noises for the Germans who are going to their supporters, where the main bulk of their supporters is away to our right. And it looks like Scallari's almost having a debrief in the centre circle already. Listen to the whistles again. As the Brazilian team started to walk towards the team, to applaud their fans, and that's what they're getting in response. Rightly so, but I think Scallari came onto the pitch and said, don't you dare walk off this pitch without applauding your fans. They have turned up, not just here tonight, but all over the country, and a bit exceptional support on this nation as a football team. And I think he's going to say, look, you owe them something. Stand there, be a man, be counted, and apologise to the fans. And we see as we did before kick off, the German away to our right holding out the big card, which says four on it. Well, they will be favourites to win their fourth world title this Sunday. And as Ian said, it's either a repeat of the 1974 final against the Dutch, or the 1990 final against Argentina. Luis Felipe Scallari hauling himself down the tunnel. Luis is in floods of tears as well. Thiago Silva is walking off with him. But Thiago Silva should feel extremely responsible, daddy Mills, for a ludicrous and needless bookie against Colombia, which ruled him out tonight. Yeah, definitely. Didn't need to do it. Did he run past the goalkeeper, just nicked the ball off him, then kicked it in the back of the net. They appealed the decision, but, you know, he was never going to overturn that yellow card. He was sorely missed. I think David Luiz, just looking down the touchline, has been dragged away as captain. He's going to have to face the media. What, what, under a week ago, he was the Brazilian hero, an absolute legend. We talked about it before the game, the fans were talking about him, captains his team, in a World Cup semi-final, responsible for the first goal, and they get beaten 7-1. The only thing I would say, Mark, and Mike mentioned that FIFA didn't make any reference to the sad death of Di Stefano. Yesterday, just to put things into perspective, FIFA also didn't make any reference to the fact that last weekend two people died here in Belo Horizonte as a bridge collapsed. Twenty people were seriously injured, two people lost their lives here in Belo Horizonte. To put it into perspective, as a nation mourns a football defeat, there are more important things than a game of football. Absolutely, well said. I remember Michel Platini saying that he went back into the dressing room after the 1982 defeat to West Germany, and devastated though they were. He realised quite soon afterwards, nobody died, it's a game of football, we've lost. But Julia Gomez from BBC Brazil, this has to be the darkest day in the history of Brazilian football. Forget 1950, in the Maracanar, in Uruguay. Is this not worse? It is, it is. First of all, great words, definitely right. There are more important things than this, but yeah, definitely. It's the darkest day in Brazilian football, as I said. Hopefully it will be bad enough for Brazilian football to be born again, let's say, to rebuild all its structures. Everything is being done wrong in this country regarding football, since top level to youth football. And we needed a shock like this. Hopefully it will have consequences. One year from now, if you ask me, Julia, what has changed? And I tell you, nothing. Then it will be only sadness, isn't it? So hopefully this will be for good, this somehow will be worked by the football authorities here in Brazil, as the Germans did after that horrible year 2000 in Belgium and Holland. This is the result of those defeats. Hopefully Brazil will take the same, or at least more or less, the same attitude, the same acts, so to change everything here. There are tears aplenty here in Belo Horizonte. The recriminations will start. So the word Maracanazo was born after that defeat. What word is going to be born after today? With the Minheiro Casso, I don't know, I've invented Portuguese here. Maracanazo comes from a Spanish word, because of Uruguay. So if we had lost to Chile, it would have been a Minerazo. I was talking to my friends, I don't know, maybe a Minerhaish. A Minerhaish. Minerhaish. Which would mean what? I don't know. I'm just mixing Minerão with German words. The Minerhaish, but it is the worst 90 minutes in Brazilian football history by a long way. Yeah, definitely. And all the humiliation, isn't it? I mean, your own supporters saying ole, ole, when the Germans were passing. Basically, to be honest, if the Germans wanted, they would have won what? 15 to 0. They actually somehow they pity Brazil and Brazilians and took it easy. Because if they wanted, it would have been like what? 12 to 1 or anything like that. So yeah, the whole humiliation, it became political somehow. Yes, they were swearing at the president, weren't they? They were swearing at the president. Obviously, these are not her voters. But yeah, it did happen. There will be people trying to make political use of it. It will be a shame, but it will happen, that's for sure. But again, what I really hope is that Brazil look at Germany. Everybody's looking at Germany, isn't it? I mean, what they did in these last 14 years in their academies, in their year football. This is not a lucky generation. This is a generation that they basically built, isn't it? This is just only the first one, actually. There will be more to come. So hopefully, Brazilian football will look at it and change. Since failing at Euro 2000, runners up in the World Cup in 2002 Germany. 2004 the group stages, but then it really does kick on. 2006 semi-finals, runners up in 2008, runners up in 2010. Semi-finals in 2012 and now a final in 2014. Sorry, David Lees has just finished his TV interview, walked down the tunnel and he was apologising to the fans. And his hands on his chest, put his hands in the air. And I think said the scoop, which is obviously, which is sorry to all the fans. He must be heartbroken. His big moment as captain of his nation has just been destroyed forever. It's the only name I heard people shouting here. Boing at him, shouting at him. Yeah, I'm in a positive way. Oh, in a positive way, right? Yeah, it's the only name. It's his one of the guys who will be forgiven. Obviously, the guys who aren't here, Thiago and Neymar, obviously. But there will be a lot of villains. There will be a lot of villains. And all the while, Mark Chapman, we just had a shot. And who complained them of German men celebrating drinking beer in their Lederhosen away to our right? Germany 7, Brazil 1. Rafael Honestain is in the Rio studio with me here. Did you think at the end the Germans looked not embarrassed to celebrate, but a little bit self-conscious. If I'm contrasting it with the quarterfinal with Brazil and Columbia, where, depending on your point of view, David Luiz either consoled or patronised James Rodriguez, the Germans very much left the Brazilians too. I think Clauser had a warm arm around. And the Dante was consoled by some of his Bayern teammates. But you could see this Germany team, the law of diminishing returns, returned to kicked in. Because with every goal by the final whistle, it felt less special. If this had been a scrappy 1-0, or the way they really had to battle against Argentina and France, the relief after the final whistle was incredible. Here, the game was over after 25 minutes, so it was just a long, long wait just to seed us out. And that professionalism is very much a mark of this side. Oliver Birhoff said he'd never seen, he'd been with many teams as a player and as a general manager, he'd never seen a team celebrate so little after going through the quarterfinals. They had a drink, they patted each other on the back, and then all went to bed. And this is the Germany team. At the danger of continuing stereotypes, Germany have been looking, as a team and as a nation, have been looking for that kind of pragmatism efficiency, because it had gone out a little bit. Or maybe they were too young, maybe they were a little bit too naive, the new generation is coming through. Now this side, they have six, seven players who already won the Champions League. You could see they are ready, they played with the maturity, and they were ready when Brazil started to falter, Germany were there, they didn't just continue, they went for the kill, and that's why they decided to game so early. Amy Lawrence alongside Rafa. Well, interested to hear you use the word pragmatism there, because if you think this is a pragmatic team, I mean to me this is a team to admire immensely, so much so that you begin to feel very strongly that this was the moment that, you know, we talk about the era of Spain being the team in world football, we all looked at ending when they went out of this World Cup, but in a way that ending has come here now, because this is the time when I think you look at Germany and say, this is modern football at its finest. You were nodding along at the end of when I was putting that question to Rafa, about the difference in the teams at the end of that game. Yeah, I'm still absolutely shell shocked, and I just feel so sorry for these Brazilian players. Can I ask why? Because this is a 90 minutes that they will be reminded of in 50 years time, and I knew some of the players from 1950 when they lost then, and I know how bitter they were about how they were treated, half a century afterwards, they were never ever allowed to forget, and that's harsh, that's really harsh. Class from Scolari at the end coming on, being the father figure, having said that, since the half hour mark, all he's been thinking of, I imagine, is how do I deal with this defeat? What can I do? Because there's nothing I can do to turn this game around. Do you think? And obviously we don't know, we're only surmising here, but we have the pictures obviously on the big screen. My belt here, the helicopters overhead here at the far end of the Copacabana beach, where there are still several police cars, lights flashing in the distance near the fan fest. It looks, as well as Luis Felipe Scolari giving Oscar a pep talk, it looked like he banged his own chest, and I say with some eyes, but he was zipped, so let me take the responsibility here. Do you think that's what he will do? Yes, I think he will. I think he has to, I think that's his role. I think it was almost quite touching the way that he took off his centre forward, Ferreji, to save him from what? Brazilian crowds, they can be absolutely vicious, and they have a tendency when things are going badly, they will pick on one player and they will go after him. And it was Ferreji, and anything that Ferreji would have done, no change. So let's get him out of the firing line, it's lost. Let's preserve him a little bit. And you tell the quality, anyone can be a gracious winner. Anyone can do what David Louise did to Hammy's Rodriguez the other day. How do you react in defeat? That really tells you who has class. And when we talk about what a defeat can mean for players, Amy? Yeah, we were reminded of the obvious situation from the 1950 final. And the comments of Barbosa, who was the goalkeeper, who was perhaps a bit unfairly scapegoated after that result, was something he lived with, and his quote really rings so horribly true for these Brazilian players. And he said shortly before his death, the maximum punishment in Brazil is 30 years imprisonment, but I've been paying for something I'm not even responsible for by now for 50 years. I've always thought that this team could lose without suffering the same consequences, but I never imagined that they could be absolutely humiliated. And this is a society where humiliation has a huge, huge power. And it's for that reason I feel so sorry for this team. I was just trying to think in historical context what this game means and what it could mean because a lot of it will depend on the final. If they don't win, as I said earlier, this will be seen almost like an empty defeat. If they are to win the World Cup, I think this game, this result, could have the same sort of resonance that Germany's win at Wembley. The first ever win at Wembley in 72 on the way to European Championships had, because England was seen as unbeatable at home. And with that win, Germany came of age, won the Euros, then won the World Cup. To beat Brazil, 7-1 in Brazil could have that similar kind of marker. As far as German football history is concerned. Let me read you some tweets. Joey Barton, who is David-Louise Prane too. If there is a God, he surely deserted him tonight on that performance. John Hart and I made a function in Edinburgh. What on earth has gone on in Brazil? 7-1. Wow. Heidi Klum, can you believe that? Can I just put out these ascent to me? I don't necessarily follow all the people that I'm reading out here. Heidi Klum, I really don't. Heidi Klum, can you believe this? I can't. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let's go to some Brazilian fans who are with Bruce Douglas this evening. Bruce? Yes, I'm in Cabal. It's this covered... And I'm with a fan now. I'm with Gabriela. I never had to walk down with a fan. What do you tell me? Well, we're having real problems with Bruce's line. So we will try again to reconnect. I will get a reaction of some Brazilian fans in a little while. Plenty more reactions have come. Mark Pugach and Mike Kingdom in Ian Dennis and Danny Mills are still in the stadium in Bella Horizonte here in the Rio Studio. Tim Vickery, Raphael Honestine and Amy Lawrence. Your reactions as well to an astonishing semifinal. 85058, hashtag BBC World Cup. Germany have beaten Brazil 7-1 in the semifinal this evening. It's 5 past 11. Here's Nathan Turby. On digital, online, smartphone and tablet. This is BBC 5 Live. Thank you, Mark. The Brazilian captain tonight, David Luiz. Let's apologise to fans after the country's worst World Cup defeat, losing 7-1 to Germany in Bella Horizonte, as we've been hearing. Many of the players were in tears at the end. Germany will now go on to face the Netherlands or Argentina in the final. The top civil servant at the Home Office has told a committee of MPs there were no records to show whether documents were destroyed or simply lost by the department in the 1980s and 90s. Mark Sedwell was giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee about the loss of 114 files potentially relating to child abuse linked to Westminster. The Labour MP Simon Danchuk wasn't impressed. He couldn't tell us the names of the files that had gone missing. He couldn't tell us whether the investigator had interviewed the Home Office official who alleges that the Home Office had paid money to the paedophile information exchange. You would have thought that the permanent secretary would have done his homework before he went in front of these MPs today. The Israeli government says it's prepared to send ground troops into Gaza to confront Hamas. Palestinian militants in Gaza say they have fired rockets into Israel. The country's military says it shot down a rocket in the Tel Aviv area. Palestinian officials say at least 15 people have been killed in Gaza by Israeli airstrikes. Israel's president is Shimon Peres. We are shooting at our children, at our mothers, at our civilians. What for? We cannot compromise with death. We cannot compromise with rockets. We cannot compromise with this sort of a behaviour. And we should stop them. Two men from Birmingham who travelled to Syria to fight with rebels have pleaded guilty to preparing to carry out terrorist attacks. Naheen Ahmed and Yusuf Zawar were both 22 were arrested on their return to the UK. Manufacturing output has fallen for the first time in six months. It dropped by 1.3% in May compared with the previous month. An investigation has begun in the United States after six unopened vials of smallpox virus were found in a storage room in a government laboratory. The freeze-dried samples are thought to date from the 1950s. Five live breakfast. The crisis in Syria continues, of course, and now we hear one in four Syrian refugee women caught in a spiral of poverty. This is according to the UN's refugee agency. The civil war has torn apart families, has torn apart communities. These women, you find many women who have fled with their children, unable to flee with their husbands for the first time. They have to basically bear this burden of looking after the family and also being the sole provider for their families. Many of these women are dependent on age because they simply cannot find work. Many of these women have never worked before. Five live breakfast. Weekday mornings from six. You're listening to BBC Radio Five Live, your home of Brazil, 2014. This is Marpeu Gachin, Belo Horizonte on the night Germany burst the Brazilian bubble in the most extraordinary fashion. We get underway. Breath-taking fixture. Germany, Brazil. Corner kick. Troubles are very long way and it's gone in. And that man has done it again. Thomas Muller. It's gone into the area to Muller. And there's a chance for Closer. Great save from Cesar, but Closer's there. Second time round to break Ronaldo's record. Against all teams, he's done it against Brazil. And is there any way back now for the hosts? Larmish forward on the right-hand side. Muller's missed it. Cross for the shots. There's the third goal. And an Estadian that he's sulting yellow. A black cloud. Looms large. If you were giving points out of 10 so far, you might give Fernandinho one for putting his shirt on the right way around. Here is Kedira. Kedira back to gross. It's a second goal. Brazil are capitulating and the Germans are romping their way through to the final in the American R. This is Kedira. He's got options. He's pulled the ball back to Erzal. Here is Kedira again. And Kedira strokes the ball in right footed. Germany are running right. You get that? If you're just joining us, this is the score line. Brazil nail Germany five. And this is the World Cup semi-final. And I have never seen balloons punctured to the extent that they were here this season. We are not closing off. It's difficult to understand the attitude. Larmish to the penalty area. Low ball. Pulting. And it is a record-equalling defeat for Brazil. It is a night nobody will ever forget. You can now hear all the fans around the stadium. Every single one of them brewing. They are absolutely out of range. Brazil totally and utterly humiliated. In all the World Cups I've covered, this is absolutely impressive. Scherler has added a second for himself. And now Germany have scored seven. And it is the heaviest defeat in Brazil's history. And the herd continues on a night when the nation of Brazil is totally humiliated. A tweet from Jürgen Klinsmann, of course, who won the World Cup the last time that the Germans did in 1990. Germany right in World Cup history. Huge, huge compliment. So proud of them. Daniel Sturridge said fair play to close and broke my idol Ronaldo's record. Unbelievable achievement. And Kevin Peterson at five nil said, I've seen a few five nils before. It's not the end of the world, Brazil. Well, it got worse than that, my kingdom. It got seven-one in Germany's favour. The great thing about sport is that it just continues to enthrall and surprise us from time to time. Well, I've got to be a bit careful of hyperbole, Mark. But, you know, it's not only the most astonishing game there's ever been, I think, at any World Cup. It's one of the most astonishing games there's ever been in the history of the sport. It's sort of like a bit like the Hungarian victory at Wembley in the 50s. Isn't it? And I'm still trying to come to terms with it and make sense of it. And for it to happen here, because, you see, I've still got this... I've taken on board everything that's been said by our local friends, but I still have this old-fashioned romantic view of Brazilian football. I know this isn't the Brazil of the 60s and 70s. Nevertheless, I thought for me coming here, it was going to be the definitive World Cup, simply because I regard this country as being the heartbeat of the game, the rhythm of the game. And I think, you know, in this tournament, many of the visiting teams have also responded to the backdrop of being here, being in Brazil, the history, the culture, the home of the carnival. And so for it to happen here, of all places, is just absolutely extraordinary. The other thing I would say is that maybe I'm being presumptuous here, but I also think that once England got knocked out, I bet Brazil were a lot of people's second team. Even though this isn't the Brazil of Pelé and everything else, you know, Riverlinia, because of what they have come to represent over the years. The only player, of course, to have come out of this unscarred is Neymar, who didn't start his first game for two years here today. But the other thing that I'm slightly concerned about is, I'm not sure the Germans are getting all the credit that they should get, because in the aftermath of all this, it's all going to be about Brazil. For me, it's very simple. Raffer's in the studio still, I think. We've said this many times. I came away from Blum Fontaine four years ago. I then went to see them in Cape Town beat Argentina 4-0. I thought this was on the agenda, not 7-1 against Brazil, but I could see them as being potential World Cup winners here. But the thing is, Danny's been on the commission, where it works is the national team works in tandem with the German league. They're all in it together. And that's the lesson for me for English football, for the future. Let's have a word with the BBC reporter, Steve Evans, who's at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Steve, we're probably like us here in Balor Horizonte. They cannot quite believe what they've just been watching on the big screens there and in their homes. They're starting to believe it now, but you're absolutely right. When it was 5-0 after 30 minutes, people were sort of shaking their heads, as though some sort of mirage was appearing on all these screens around me. Now, we're way past midnight here at the Brandenburg Gate, and there is a Brazilian party going on. It's the kind of thing which is meant to happen in Rio, and not to happen in Germany, but it's the other way around. And I was listening to your contributor earlier. I think what's impressed them here is that there was a bit of style to that play. It was kind of machine football, but beautifully played. There was imagination and working things, and that's what they love about it. They just think, bring on the final now. Steve, thank you very much indeed. Steve Evans at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Tim Vickery back in our Rio studio. Tim, is this the end of... I'm not saying before the third place match, but is this the end of Scolari? Oh, I would imagine so. I think he was going to go anyway. And before the Chile game, he said, whatever happens, I'm still the last Brazilian coach to win the World Cup. Feels a little bit hollow now. A couple of points on what's just been said, and clearly agree on the danger of Germany not getting enough credit. If they do go all the way, this will be one of the greatest World Cup wins in the history of the sport. Germany had a ferocious first round draw, not only in terms of opponents, but in terms of the location of their games. Last year, after the Confederations Cup, Oliver Bierhoff, their technical director, said it would be almost impossible for a European team to win this World Cup. Germany have done it so far, the hard way, and in style. And something Mike said about other teams, maybe have responded to the Brazilian backdrop in this World Cup. Well, maybe to an extent, but I think it's perhaps more true to flip it round the other way. I think Brazilian crowds have responded to the quality of modern football played by the other teams, because the football on display, and I felt this very clearly in the game between Ghana and Germany, a really pulsating second half, really intense. And this is the thing that the Brazilian media are picking up on, the intensity of the games. In comparison with domestic football in Brazil, this is just a... It's not even one class, it's two classes, three classes, four classes above. Brazilian football has suffered the huge danger of success, which is that you become complacent, and you think that your history will get you through. Julio Gomez has been making absolutely these points, and quite brilliantly as well. This is the moment when all of that balloon should be punctured. The medicine today for Brazilian football has been very, very cruel, but also, I think, very necessary. I think what is going to be interesting, Mark, about this, if Germany do go on and win the final, 1-0, 2-1, 3-1, I'm not sure they're going to be remembered for the final. It would almost be a case of, who did Germany play in the final? You know, when they won it in Brazil, they beat Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final. This will probably be the memorable game. People will almost forget about the final, because this is the game that everybody will remember. Well, yes, I think you're right, Danny, but I think if a little man called Messi runs the game in the way that Maradona did, and if he gets to the final, then I think we'll also be going away with a memory of that too, but I know what you're saying. I'm sure if Germany win it, everyone will be... This is the game that everybody will remember. Oh, Messi might score 4-3 or 4-1 in the World Cup final, if they get there, and we'll be talking about that, but I just think this game, you'll never... I don't think I've been in contact as long as you, but we will never, ever see anything like this ever again. I was interested in what Rafa said earlier on the program, in some respects, Mark, do they want to be overwhelming favourites? Because that's what everybody's going to make them now. Whoever they play, Holland or Argentina, after this, Germany are the favourites, and maybe they won't be comfortable with that role. I think if they lose the final to Holland or Germany or Argentina, they will be like Holland 74, Hungary 54. A great team who fell at the final hurdle. Sorry, Chelsea. Would it... How bad would it now be if Argentina now win the World Cup? It would make things worse. Can it get any worse, Julia? I've got my arm around, Julia. Can it get any worse? I think it can. Messi scores a hat trick tomorrow, and a hat trick on Sunday. Yeah, it would be similar. But I tell you what, I think Brazil will back Germany up, even against Holland, because somehow we still have this, isn't it? I mean, we like football, we love football, and this Germany team, I don't know when they scored the sixth or fifth, when they lost count, they were applauded. Well, they were applauded for the seventh. For the seventh, right. Yes, I think there were boos for the sixth and applause for the seventh. I think that's the way it was. You're going to have to translate this for us. We want to play this David Luiz interview in Portuguese, because you can hear how emotional he is. So let's have a listen first. I just wanted to give my people joy. My people, who are already suffering from this, unfortunately we didn't get it. I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry, everyone. I just wanted to see my people smiling. Everyone knows how important it was for me. Very. Now you said the school pay a few times, which means sorry, doesn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He says he only wanted to bring joy to his people, to put a smile on his people's face, and he was really sorry. He was really sorry. He said that many, many times. It's emotional, yeah. It's hard to hear a professional footballer, a man, a good man. He is a good man. He's a great guy. It's difficult. It's painful to listen to that, because you say he is a good man. It's painful to listen to that. John Southland is down in the mix zone. Now this is where the players come past. They don't have to stop. They really don't. Quite often they don't. John, what's the scene down there? Well, you know what mix zone is like, Mark, but I've never seen so many people in the mix zone before in any competition. There must be 200-plus journalists down here waiting, as you say, for the players to come through. No sign of anybody yet. I'm sure the German players will be more than happy to stop. Now I've done three Brazil games at this World Cup, and generally the Brazilians have always stopped. They've always spoken to the media. David Luiz, who I know from Chelsea, as we just heard from him there, is such a decent individual and he's such a decent man. But I wonder tonight if he will stop. I mean, he will possibly be one of the only ones who does. And how long it will be before the Brazil team come through here, is anybody's guess. It could be a long time. It could be a long night down here. I'll tell you what, they will all stop. That's what happened in 2010. I had never seen and never saw after that such a devastating mix zone as in 2010, the Brazilian defeat to Holland. It will probably break the record tonight. But it's a characteristic of these Brazilian players. They never escape from their responsibility. They will all, maybe Fred will escape the reporters, but they will all talk. They will all be crying. There won't be much to say, but they will all be there. What they do is they sort of walk down an avenue, which is sort of through barriers. And as John has just described, there are a couple of hundred reporters there, radio and TV and newspapers as well. And you basically shout and you say, can we have a word? You have a word with the BBC and it's up to them whether they stop or not. Luis Felipe Scolari has just said in their press conference, we ask for forgiveness. To the people, please excuse us. I'm sorry, we could not get to the final. What was so extraordinary about the way this game panned out, Mark, was that I'd love to rewind the tape and listen to our first eight or nine minutes. Danny and I were commentating. We were just all of us taken aback emotionally by the anthem. The German players seemed to shrink actually for the first eight or nine minutes. I saw them come out against France in the quarterfinal and just control the game right from the start. And all of our commentary was suggesting that the Brazilians have made a fantastic start, the Germans look a little bit rattled, and then I have never seen floodgates open in the way that they did here. It was almost their first attack, wasn't it? You go back for the first 11 minutes, Brazil, you know, okay, their final ball wasn't brilliant, but they were high tempo, they were closing people down. They created some half chances, and they came out like they did against Colombia on the front foot, and we're going to go for this. Suddenly, Germany were giving the ball away, which is very un-German like. The corner comes in, David Luiz loses concentration, 1-0, and then it just fell apart. And there's no excuse for that, Danny. You're the defender, a World Cup defender. There's no excuse, even though the goal the Mula goal was very, very sloppy. There's no excuse for what followed after that, is there? They're only 1-0 down, they've got 80 minutes to get it back. Exactly. Well, the excuse for David Luiz's goal, I think he was so pumped up, there was so much adrenaline flowing, we saw the emotion in the players' eyes, the anthem. They were so pumped up on adrenaline, they were chasing round, here and everywhere, like crazy men, all over the place. And that sort of flowed into that first 10-15 minutes. He lost concentration, lost his man, but then they did, they just fell apart, and it was in the end, it was sad to see. Have you got a theory why they fell apart? I think it's tactical. I slightly disagree with you guys, after 10 minutes, I tweeted, and it was new, new. If Brazil keeps playing like that, it's 3-0 after half-hour. I didn't see it coming 5-0 after 25. But I really thought the team was as open as in the other matches. No midfield, Bernhard here. I mean, it was a dreadful decision to use Bernhard. Now, okay, it's easy to say now, but we were talking about that before. It was a gamble. It was a gamble. Brazil could have scored in the first 5-6 minutes, it could have happened. It didn't, and then the team was completely open. So it really reminded me, not a couple of, but some Barcelona matches throughout the years, when they struggled in the first 10 minutes just to adjust. And when they adjusted, it was a massacre. So it looked to me that after 10 minutes, the German had adjust. And if Brazil didn't respond to that, it would be a massacre just as it was. And we highlighted pretty much Marcelo. A-Wal, defensive midfielders, nowhere to be seen. I would actually pin the blame more at those defensive midfield players, because everyone knows what Marcelo is all about. That's the tactic. And in the past, we've been used to say, Dunga in 1994 doing that job so that Kappu could go flying. And then at the last, when they won the World Cup in 2002, Mark, they had the magnificent Gilberto Silva. Tonight, Tim pointed out very early on Fernandinho all over the place. That wasn't the Fernandinho we see from Ant City, was it? Even Luis Costavo, who in the last episode, what a big miss he's going to be, was non-existent tonight. All the talk is about playing three holding midfield players. They should have played five holding midfield players. And you quite rightly said that you felt that would be a danger, Marcelo, going forward. And you said, Julio, yes, he will get forward, but Luis Costavo will shuffle over and block off that avenue. It doesn't do it. It didn't happen, did it? It just didn't happen. I thought that Bernard was going to go on that side, and Hulk, who I saw at the times at the Olympics, sometimes would switch to the right-hand side. But I mean, Fred, no wonder poor old Fred got booed. I mean, he was anonymous. Hulk didn't get back. It was... Yeah, but Marcelo, when he plays like that for Real Madrid, has got Kedira, he's got Javier Alonso, he's got people like that protecting him. That just simply wasn't there this evening. There was talk at one stage of them playing all three, Fernandinho, Costavo and Paulinho. And then we were a little bit surprised that Bernard came in. And so whether Scolari now regrets not doing that, but the other two were just... They were bypassed. Let's hear from Juninho, the World Cup winner of 2002, who's just been talking to Jason Mohamed. Juninho, you know some of these players. That's a very good question the boys have been talking about in the studio. How do they recover? Well, it would be difficult. Some of them I don't think could be back to where the Brazilian shirt was. A lot of pressure on them. But it's wrong for us now, it's a great size, all the players. So we saw on the field, we saw German and Titios how to play football. We have to learn from that. We have to learn from the seven goals that we're concerned. The Germans played the way that we like to play, the way that we ever play. So we need now to sit back, see what's wrong with Brazilian football. Is something wrong? It's not because of these defeats. Is something wrong? Especially in the academy, the way that we cheat them to play. So there's a lot of change, I think we'll come. Just some more thoughts from Scolari. It's a catastrophe, the worst loss of a Brazil national team. We have to learn how to deal with this. And when it talking about the first half blitz of goals, he said it was like we blanked out. Rafa Honekstein, Rafa, it's a little bit of you that thinks, come on, give Germany some credit. It's all about Brazil, this. No, but the credit that Germany can take is that they exploited Brazil's problems today. And they did it beautifully. I looked at what Joachim Luf said in the press conference. He said that we knew that it would come at us with passion and with commitment. And we had to keep a cool head and resist that pressure and then take advantage. And what was so surprising is that after that first goal, Germany scored, you still think there's 18 minutes for Brazil. Don't open up. Don't open up. Don't start running all forward like headless chicken. I mean, this is a Scolari Brazil to be so open, so without any discipline, tactically, you know, it almost doesn't matter individually. You can point at all players and saying this is his mistake. That's that mistake. But the whole positioning collective, it was all over the place. And Germany in the end found it easy. And you saw if you give them a bit of space, then the automatism, as we say in Germany, they kick in people in Norway, Chavarra. They play nice one and twos without looking up. The lightness that wasn't there in this tournament so far came back. But it came because Brazil allowed them to do it. And you have to praise Germany. Of course you do. But Brazil made it easy for them. And I think Germany, that that will be the message that Germany themselves will be telling for the next few days. Don't get carried away. Don't think you're any of the world champions. We played beautifully, but we were allowed to do that. And whoever will play is not going to make life so easy for us. And just roll over. Rafa, thank you very much, Anil. Giulio, thank you. Mike, Danny, Anil. Thank you very much. We'll be in Sao Paulo tomorrow night for Argentina against the Netherlands. The winners, of course, to play Germany. A night here in Belo Horizonte that shocked the World Cup. And now Germany have scored seven. And it is the heaviest defeat in Brazil's illustrious history. And the herd continues on a night when the nation of Brazil is totally humiliated.",
