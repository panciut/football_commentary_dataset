[0.00 - 2.56] P:1766.94 E:0.036652 |  The Royal's are twirling them around, the Arsenal banners.
[2.56 - 5.96] P:1735.74 E:0.095379 |  They see a Royal standard in there as well with the Arsenal badge on it,
[5.96 - 10.72] P:1636.66 E:0.094572 |  and the players go into a huddle as close as they can towards that corner of the ground.
[10.72 - 12.84] P:1764.11 E:0.103666 |  So the teams tonight, as we've discussed,
[12.84 - 18.68] P:1711.04 E:0.095243 |  Usman Dembele, PSG's top scorer, 33 goals, scored the goal in the first leg.
[18.68 - 25.92] P:1703.79 E:0.104733 |  The enormous explosion goes off as the red flares are lit in the end to our left.
[25.92 - 28.76] P:1517.42 E:0.106514 |  PSG with Donnarummar in goal.
[28.84 - 32.80] P:1590.46 E:0.111604 |  Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho and Mendes, the familiar now back four,
[32.80 - 36.64] P:1476.26 E:0.101742 |  familiar middle three as well, Vittini, Joanne Eves and Fabian Ruiz.
[36.64 - 38.36] P:1516.20 E:0.093007 |  And then the front three.
[38.36 - 42.12] P:1700.91 E:0.102444 |  Expectation is that Desiree Douay will play through the middle,
[42.12 - 48.56] P:1627.33 E:0.091453 |  the 19-year-old, with Bradley Valkala and Keviche Claretscalia in the wide positions.
[48.56 - 51.24] P:1438.01 E:0.100528 |  We'll just see how that does settle down right now.
[51.24 - 54.20] P:1671.24 E:0.098638 |  It's Valkala who's over the ball in the centre circle actually.
[54.24 - 57.08] P:1624.22 E:0.097981 |  Arsenal's team tonight, Trossard's on the bench.
[57.08 - 61.64] P:1712.54 E:0.105447 |  There is the whistle from Felix Zviat, the German referee,
[61.64 - 66.52] P:1523.67 E:0.101730 |  and he gets us underway and PSG immediately hit the ball down the right-hand side
[66.52 - 67.92] P:1594.46 E:0.086900 |  and it's out of play for a throw.
[67.92 - 73.96] P:1518.77 E:0.098962 |  So the Arsenal team, Ryering goal, Kimba is fit, big doubt that he plays.
[73.96 - 78.68] P:1516.68 E:0.087920 |  Saliba and Kivio and Lewis Skelly at left back, then party.
[78.68 - 82.28] P:1703.57 E:0.091564 |  Suspended for the first leg last week, party, Odegaard and Reiss,
[82.28 - 85.20] P:1547.91 E:0.098963 |  and then Saka and Martinelli either side of Miquel,
[85.20 - 90.20] P:1807.86 E:0.102946 |  Marino playing as the auxiliary striker.
[90.20 - 93.72] P:1893.75 E:0.101864 |  And here's Bukaio Saka now for the first time for Arsenal,
[93.72 - 98.88] P:1762.64 E:0.093964 |  taking the ball on, but he can't get past Nuno Mendes,
[98.88 - 102.08] P:1784.68 E:0.100194 |  who clears it actually and it bounces into Saka,
[102.08 - 104.52] P:1795.12 E:0.095528 |  and then his right foot, he gives it away.
[104.52 - 108.08] P:1774.91 E:0.095714 |  So Arsenal back in possession with party, then it's up to Marino.
[108.08 - 110.80] P:1696.31 E:0.092158 |  Party goes in with a high foot on Fabian Ruiz,
[110.84 - 113.04] P:1700.86 E:0.096806 |  the ball bounces very high in the air,
[113.04 - 116.24] P:1451.05 E:0.096868 |  and then Odegaard, as he attempted to bring it down, ran away from him
[116.24 - 118.08] P:1564.95 E:0.092727 |  and PSG had got it back on the edge of the box.
[118.08 - 121.96] P:1613.67 E:0.111388 |  I'm assuming Arsenal won the toss and decided to change ends just to unsell.
[121.96 - 127.12] P:1603.49 E:0.105060 |  That's the first little sign that they're going to try and un-settle this PSG team.
[127.12 - 129.08] P:1781.45 E:0.094121 |  And they've started the game in a fashion of,
[129.08 - 130.92] P:1605.52 E:0.111032 |  we're going to make it physical, they've gone long,
[130.92 - 134.24] P:1639.49 E:0.097609 |  they've kicked the ball quite high, they want to make it a bit scrappy,
[134.24 - 136.40] P:1433.07 E:0.100588 |  they've got to turn it into a physical battle.
[136.44 - 141.24] P:1490.71 E:0.099754 |  And remember after Villarparque, Luis Enrique said that his team
[141.24 - 143.24] P:1529.34 E:0.086728 |  are not the biggest of teams.
[143.24 - 146.44] P:1544.36 E:0.104333 |  And Villarra in that second half made things uncomfortable for them.
[146.44 - 149.60] P:1570.74 E:0.099684 |  They punch above their weight really, John, physically, this Paris team.
[149.60 - 152.68] P:1532.22 E:0.096967 |  They do a great job physically, given the stature,
[152.68 - 156.64] P:1509.55 E:0.094330 |  but I think it's an area that Arsenal really have to try and exploit.
[156.64 - 159.28] P:1662.79 E:0.111866 |  Marino through the middle, long pass forward from Raya,
[159.28 - 163.36] P:1695.78 E:0.108456 |  clicked it on with his head, and then Marquinhos is able to win a throw in
[163.40 - 166.36] P:1644.62 E:0.090931 |  the right back area.
[166.36 - 171.84] P:1650.15 E:0.083431 |  And Marquinhos, the captain, great, great servant for this club.
[171.84 - 175.44] P:1662.67 E:0.099118 |  12 years a PSG player, five years as captain.
[175.44 - 180.72] P:1646.02 E:0.090019 |  He clenches his fist to the supporters who respond with another enormous cheer.
[180.72 - 183.00] P:1745.56 E:0.097850 |  Arsenal, red and white shirts, white shorts,
[183.00 - 185.68] P:1788.48 E:0.092476 |  and it's been brought forward from the back by Saliba,
[185.68 - 188.88] P:1701.30 E:0.095676 |  forward of the centre-circle, but then to Timber, and then Timber.
[188.88 - 192.04] P:1756.08 E:0.098352 |  Rolls it into the path of Saka down the right wing.
[192.08 - 194.32] P:1737.36 E:0.111421 |  Saka cutting infield, but the challenge comes in on him.
[194.32 - 197.32] P:1723.30 E:0.098245 |  It was Kvarys Kali, but he's dispossessed by Timber,
[197.32 - 199.52] P:1855.16 E:0.107048 |  chance to cross into the penalty area,
[199.52 - 205.20] P:1718.30 E:0.085202 |  and it's headed wide on the edge of a six-yard box by Declan Rice,
[205.20 - 207.12] P:1684.72 E:0.085491 |  who holds his head.
[207.12 - 210.12] P:1677.15 E:0.102423 |  He had a defender there with him, but he couldn't direct it on target.
[210.12 - 213.64] P:1581.21 E:0.080177 |  Wow, big chance for Declan Rice.
[213.64 - 217.12] P:1613.29 E:0.101332 |  Gets good contact on the ball, really gets up high.
[217.12 - 220.80] P:1506.44 E:0.090969 |  I mean, it's Timber that won the ball back, gets it down the line,
[220.80 - 224.24] P:1548.70 E:0.090609 |  and crosses it, really nice flight, it ball into the box.
[224.24 - 227.24] P:1433.55 E:0.087676 |  Yeah, really good effort from Rice.
[227.24 - 229.36] P:1526.68 E:0.088133 |  First chance for the match.
[229.36 - 231.64] P:1552.49 E:0.097934 |  PSG 0, Arsenal 0.
[231.64 - 233.16] P:1289.68 E:0.084580 |  This is five-live.
[233.16 - 237.12] P:1463.87 E:0.098820 |  Remember, you can listen to all BBC Radio five-live included
[237.12 - 241.04] P:1561.76 E:0.099211 |  via BBC Sounds if you're on the move, via the BBC Sounds app.
[241.04 - 242.00] P:1394.33 E:0.104353 |  Here's Martin Ely,
[242.00 - 244.52] P:1498.62 E:0.093376 |  already seen one excellent piece of tackling back from him.
[244.52 - 246.36] P:1545.19 E:0.102302 |  Now he's heading in the right direction.
[246.36 - 250.28] P:1657.13 E:0.102315 |  Martin Ely down the left-hand side, and in comes the challenge from Hakimi,
[250.32 - 253.04] P:1591.66 E:0.099791 |  which puts it out of play and referees the virus as the final touch
[253.04 - 255.12] P:1595.68 E:0.085753 |  was off the PSG man.
[255.12 - 257.64] P:1817.88 E:0.104528 |  So it's a throw-in for Arsenal, made a good start.
[257.64 - 260.20] P:1910.80 E:0.089190 |  Trotter start from Arsenal, have to say.
[260.20 - 264.32] P:1914.81 E:0.103459 |  Confident, aggressive, taking the game to Paris,
[264.32 - 267.24] P:1940.51 E:0.095082 |  both Martin Ely on one side and Sakhar on the other.
[267.24 - 270.36] P:1930.42 E:0.101357 |  Long throw, Arsenal conceded from a long throw
[270.36 - 272.44] P:1879.43 E:0.090331 |  against Bournemouth on Saturday night.
[272.44 - 275.04] P:1847.31 E:0.079293 |  Let's see what they can do with this one.
[275.04 - 279.32] P:1715.23 E:0.102931 |  Long from party into the penalty area, but the load saved by Donoroma.
[279.36 - 284.04] P:1752.68 E:0.096758 |  The chance from close range, arriving in the six-yard box.
[285.04 - 287.64] P:1592.84 E:0.092667 |  And it was saved by Donoroma.
[287.64 - 290.40] P:1476.61 E:0.112059 |  And I think it was Martin Ely, who was the player,
[290.40 - 293.28] P:1624.35 E:0.098331 |  who got the contact in between all of those blue shirts.
[293.28 - 295.88] P:1587.70 E:0.104114 |  But Donoroma kept it out with his first save of the night.
[295.88 - 300.52] P:1531.62 E:0.098389 |  Well, big talking point before the game was the PSG goalkeeper.
[300.52 - 304.68] P:1545.29 E:0.097526 |  And so early on, he's delivered a brilliant reaction save down to his left.
[304.68 - 309.00] P:1485.67 E:0.092473 |  I mean, there's so many bodies in the box, brilliant long throw in.
[309.04 - 310.68] P:1433.72 E:0.102088 |  And he just has to react.
[310.68 - 314.44] P:1521.70 E:0.097812 |  The ball bouncing towards him, but it's just the reaction to parm it away.
[316.04 - 319.08] P:1534.48 E:0.096133 |  And it was Martin Ely, who's still in there.
[319.08 - 320.12] P:1613.74 E:0.099325 |  Good run, wasn't it?
[320.12 - 323.08] P:1571.12 E:0.091559 |  Yeah, excellent. And that could easily have been 1-0 as well.
[323.08 - 328.08] P:1677.05 E:0.093156 |  So strong start from Arsenal, but still 0-0, so PSG 1-0 up on the night.
[328.08 - 332.84] P:1723.82 E:0.095523 |  All for the right to play Inter in the final three weeks on Saturday.
[332.84 - 334.44] P:1822.70 E:0.091428 |  You'll hear that with us on Five Life.
[334.44 - 338.04] P:1793.87 E:0.092900 |  As Arsenal come forward again, the ball clipped right across the penalty area.
[338.04 - 340.32] P:1876.25 E:0.091606 |  Martin Ely gets it down, still in the box.
[340.32 - 341.88] P:1906.52 E:0.089666 |  Martin Ely right foot crossed.
[341.88 - 345.96] P:1831.28 E:0.096089 |  That's headed away by Nuno Mendes and then further away PSG.
[345.96 - 350.00] P:1691.23 E:0.096997 |  Really being put under pressure here by Arsenal in the early stages.
[350.00 - 353.80] P:1671.71 E:0.111929 |  And confounding what we've seen here, the evidence of our eyes
[353.80 - 358.08] P:1839.80 E:0.095924 |  when we were here with Manchester City and with Liverpool
[358.08 - 360.00] P:1859.94 E:0.097827 |  and with Aspen Ville as well.
[361.28 - 366.16] P:1910.32 E:0.090863 |  This is their eighth match, PSG, against English clubs
[366.16 - 368.16] P:1925.13 E:0.090348 |  in the Champions League this season.
[368.96 - 373.68] P:1813.03 E:0.092677 |  Here is Rice playing the ball to the right-hand side, Audegarde.
[373.68 - 376.44] P:1770.38 E:0.095555 |  Then Saka is challenged, might have been fouled,
[376.44 - 380.04] P:1669.70 E:0.090642 |  yes he was, by Nuno Mendes, and that's a three-kick near the halfway line.
[380.04 - 383.12] P:1534.98 E:0.098063 |  You get the impression that Kaio Saka's going to have to do something
[383.12 - 386.64] P:1844.58 E:0.110952 |  a little bit different to his normal game this season.
[386.64 - 390.56] P:1924.29 E:0.098637 |  He's got two kind of one-on-ones against Mendes in the left-back position,
[390.56 - 393.16] P:1927.27 E:0.097815 |  who's just outstanding in those duels.
[393.16 - 395.96] P:1910.09 E:0.091587 |  And I think he's going to have to find a different type of movement.
[395.96 - 399.40] P:1890.64 E:0.097851 |  A different solution to be impactful in this game
[399.40 - 404.20] P:1945.56 E:0.092260 |  because him and Cabaret Scalia really double up well defensively on that side.
[404.20 - 408.08] P:1827.86 E:0.089612 |  Yes, and here he is again, as Timber gives it to Saka.
[408.08 - 413.16] P:1834.33 E:0.095820 |  And it's Saka running at Nuno Mendes, and then infield away from Fortuna.
[413.16 - 417.88] P:1870.18 E:0.091344 |  Still Saka on the ball, 25 yards out, and he just, with his left foot,
[417.88 - 419.76] P:1790.53 E:0.099764 |  finds Martinelli, who's on the left flank.
[419.76 - 423.48] P:1839.42 E:0.103137 |  Martinelli takes on Bicicchini to the byline, trying to pull it back.
[423.52 - 426.28] P:1642.49 E:0.099417 |  And Hakimi, the recovering Hakimi, was able to block it behind.
[426.28 - 429.16] P:1697.79 E:0.100471 |  Another corner to Arsenal, first corner of the match to Arsenal.
[429.16 - 430.80] P:1650.64 E:0.109678 |  Yeah, it's a shame, he did what he needed to do.
[430.80 - 432.60] P:1896.79 E:0.103699 |  He kind of wriggled his way past Hakimi,
[432.60 - 435.40] P:1926.69 E:0.096955 |  and then didn't quite take the ball within Martinelli,
[435.40 - 439.48] P:1966.54 E:0.095346 |  got it caught under his feet, so he couldn't get his head up and find the cutback.
[439.48 - 442.40] P:1901.06 E:0.091651 |  There was players arriving in and around the penalty spot,
[442.40 - 445.32] P:1958.40 E:0.101397 |  but really good early signs from Arsenal.
[445.32 - 448.88] P:1905.98 E:0.097826 |  Martinelli and Saka both getting a lot of ball in that wide area.
[448.88 - 452.04] P:1949.06 E:0.083847 |  So set, piece, chance for Arsenal.
[452.04 - 454.68] P:1901.27 E:0.107753 |  You know the danger of that, PSG, well aware of it.
[455.80 - 460.12] P:1961.95 E:0.103779 |  Declan Rice to take this, just leans forward and pulls his socks right up,
[460.12 - 461.88] P:1989.89 E:0.094611 |  raises his left arm,
[461.88 - 463.92] P:1906.98 E:0.108462 |  Rice with the delivery of the corner to the back post,
[463.92 - 468.56] P:1818.24 E:0.100576 |  Donnarola comes and gets a punch on that, beyond the far post.
[468.56 - 470.68] P:1723.42 E:0.081295 |  Players, he didn't care.
[470.68 - 473.40] P:1665.38 E:0.096110 |  The big six-foot-five Italian goalkeeper
[473.40 - 474.64] P:1823.68 E:0.109954 |  was going to get to that ball,
[474.64 - 478.04] P:1888.60 E:0.095669 |  come what man in amongst the crowd of players, he punched it out for a throw.
[478.04 - 481.48] P:1990.51 E:0.094926 |  You don't see many goalkeepers go and get that ball so far deep.
[481.48 - 484.32] P:1934.42 E:0.087000 |  I mean, he went a long way there, Donnarama.
[484.32 - 487.92] P:1862.22 E:0.092873 |  Big decision to go, positive, but if you make that call
[487.92 - 490.72] P:1894.77 E:0.098954 |  and then you go and punch it as well as what he did, it was a right call.
[490.72 - 493.52] P:1860.88 E:0.103641 |  Another long throw, they're testing them, blocked out to the edge of the area.
[493.52 - 496.04] P:1755.60 E:0.106940 |  Oh, the guard! Oh, it's saved!
[496.04 - 497.92] P:1573.32 E:0.106767 |  Saved by Donnarama.
[497.92 - 499.40] P:1699.20 E:0.106096 |  That was an excellent save.
[499.40 - 504.04] P:1781.04 E:0.098784 |  That came through a crowd of players, down to his right, he flung himself at it
[504.04 - 506.04] P:1686.70 E:0.104114 |  and was able to turn it round the post.
[506.04 - 508.68] P:1797.09 E:0.109747 |  That was hit with some power from Donnarama as well.
[508.68 - 511.36] P:1912.74 E:0.095643 |  Wow, Arsenal can't believe.
[511.44 - 513.80] P:1869.64 E:0.091659 |  They're not level in this tie.
[513.80 - 517.16] P:1818.70 E:0.093380 |  What a save down to the left, it bobbles out to the edge of the box.
[517.16 - 521.28] P:1794.90 E:0.091689 |  Super hit from Oda guard, keeps it low, absolutely perfect,
[521.28 - 525.72] P:1729.82 E:0.086990 |  but what a reaction and again, it's that low to the left-hand side.
[525.72 - 529.12] P:1717.59 E:0.077265 |  I mean, how quickly he can get down Donnarama.
[529.12 - 533.36] P:1711.39 E:0.093860 |  The pace that that shot was hit through the bodies as well, John.
[533.36 - 537.68] P:1383.94 E:0.099227 |  He couldn't have been perfectly sighted to see that ball, but what a reaction.
[537.68 - 540.32] P:1403.80 E:0.108337 |  I mean, he's laying in a heap on the floor at the moment,
[540.36 - 541.84] P:1553.56 E:0.091296 |  he's not got up from that save.
[541.84 - 547.20] P:1439.53 E:0.099414 |  No, he's down on his back, whether he was winded by it, I'm not sure,
[547.20 - 550.52] P:1558.87 E:0.087477 |  because he went down with some force as well, because he had to.
[550.52 - 555.64] P:1482.19 E:0.081121 |  He had to go down very, very quickly and shot on the edge of the penalty area.
[555.64 - 557.64] P:1500.50 E:0.079870 |  I mean, the ball was a blur.
[557.64 - 560.24] P:1560.80 E:0.067671 |  It's a brilliant start from Arsenal.
[560.24 - 564.24] P:1724.35 E:0.096159 |  I mean, they couldn't have started this game any better, the confidence,
[564.24 - 568.28] P:1753.81 E:0.091464 |  the belief he's going to give the team to think we can go and win this tie.
[568.32 - 573.04] P:1653.13 E:0.092564 |  I mean, it's just something that PSG are going to have to have a look at.
[573.04 - 577.28] P:1718.43 E:0.086932 |  I think they're really pleased that they're having a bit of a break here, PSG.
[577.28 - 580.04] P:1659.61 E:0.096442 |  They've got a little bit of time just to have a chat with each other
[580.04 - 582.40] P:1345.10 E:0.102042 |  and get settled into this game.
[583.60 - 586.92] P:1751.89 E:0.109294 |  And there's the cheer, because Donnarama is on his feet.
[586.92 - 590.96] P:1697.92 E:0.096138 |  They sent out their Russian goalkeeper, Matve Safonov,
[590.96 - 596.16] P:1813.76 E:0.099107 |  who played at the weekend when they made ten changes and lost to...
[596.96 - 600.08] P:1895.81 E:0.095646 |  to Liam Rossini as Strasbourg on Saturday.
[600.08 - 605.64] P:1878.24 E:0.088061 |  But all of the big guns are back, with the exception of Dembele,
[605.64 - 608.04] P:1877.71 E:0.085721 |  who's on the bench, where they will see him.
[608.04 - 609.76] P:1897.25 E:0.097967 |  Remains to be seen.
[609.76 - 613.16] P:1894.02 E:0.096080 |  But Arsenal continuing this excellent start, still in the first ten minutes.
[613.16 - 616.84] P:1940.89 E:0.098057 |  Still 0-0, but they could easily have scored one, maybe two goals.
[616.84 - 619.08] P:1814.97 E:0.089333 |  Corner then in towards the near post from Saka.
[619.08 - 620.88] P:1656.66 E:0.089592 |  That's headed back out to the far side.
[620.88 - 625.16] P:1654.27 E:0.086994 |  It's just clear clouted, really, with his left foot up in the air.
[625.16 - 628.56] P:1652.83 E:0.097107 |  Fabian Ruiz, and then it's out of play for another throw.
[628.56 - 631.48] P:1847.23 E:0.095922 |  And here we go again, the long throw, clear tactic tonight.
[631.48 - 633.00] P:1841.74 E:0.073945 |  They're just setting it up.
[633.00 - 637.32] P:1851.66 E:0.091588 |  They're making this game as ugly and as physical as they possibly can,
[637.32 - 641.88] P:1883.65 E:0.088426 |  but they've had real flashes of quality in and around it so far.
[641.88 - 644.36] P:1849.30 E:0.094228 |  Kivyol comes up, he's at the near post.
[644.36 - 646.12] P:1829.62 E:0.103974 |  Marino's buzzing around.
[646.12 - 648.24] P:1921.76 E:0.104948 |  Here's the long, flat throw from Parti.
[648.24 - 650.12] P:1839.89 E:0.096780 |  That's headed away to the edge of the area,
[650.12 - 652.80] P:1803.53 E:0.083885 |  Audegarde with the shot, that's blocked, bounces back out.
[652.80 - 654.28] P:1728.61 E:0.087795 |  Parti lifts it across.
[654.28 - 658.68] P:1735.38 E:0.097878 |  Marino tries to get there, that's one in the air by Patrell for Paris Saint-Germain.
[658.68 - 661.08] P:1666.94 E:0.100766 |  Martin Ely, well defended.
[661.08 - 664.04] P:1749.14 E:0.114063 |  Very difficult that, that was a super throw from Parti.
[664.04 - 670.28] P:1736.98 E:0.116377 |  And then Lewis Skelly is challenged and stays down, and PSG are off now.
[670.28 - 672.84] P:1781.88 E:0.101737 |  Finally on the attack again, they've survived the pressure,
[672.84 - 676.88] P:1759.44 E:0.099739 |  but Hakimi, the groans from the PSG fans,
[676.88 - 680.80] P:1882.22 E:0.105155 |  told the story across the low cross, far too close to Raya,
[681.52 - 683.56] P:1666.11 E:0.096684 |  who's almost able to pick it up like a back pass.
[683.56 - 687.48] P:1735.66 E:0.093446 |  I think it's a case of sometimes too much time, and a lot of time to get his head up.
[687.48 - 692.16] P:1586.87 E:0.093651 |  Declan Reis does brilliantly, he makes the run back into the defensive left-back position,
[692.16 - 694.88] P:1568.00 E:0.097525 |  which allows Saliba to stay in the box.
[694.88 - 697.88] P:1656.28 E:0.100106 |  I mean, Saliba decided that very early on, he wasn't going to come out,
[697.88 - 700.72] P:1574.33 E:0.104791 |  because if he left that area, Arsenal were in big trouble,
[700.72 - 702.88] P:1566.68 E:0.085936 |  and he just panned out all right for them.
[702.88 - 706.48] P:1567.97 E:0.099468 |  So it's still Nel Nel, Paris Saint-Germain Nel, Arsenal Nel,
[706.48 - 712.52] P:1546.73 E:0.087734 |  but we've already seen very good saves from Donnaroma, from Martinelli,
[712.52 - 716.52] P:1557.27 E:0.099335 |  and from Odegaard to add to the saves that he made in the first leg
[716.52 - 719.08] P:1526.61 E:0.077585 |  when he kept a clean sheet at the Emirates.
[719.08 - 723.12] P:1488.87 E:0.091107 |  Arsenal, who have never come through a European tie
[723.12 - 725.32] P:1601.39 E:0.080972 |  when they've lost the first leg at home.
[725.32 - 731.16] P:1630.01 E:0.093673 |  Five previous instances of that, Arsenal have gone out on every occasion.
[731.16 - 735.44] P:1809.59 E:0.092527 |  So history is against them, but this is a unique night,
[735.48 - 737.12] P:1761.31 E:0.094188 |  and they've started very well.
[737.12 - 740.56] P:1597.94 E:0.096956 |  The only thing they're lacking is a goal, but they have one another throw in.
[740.56 - 743.56] P:1692.54 E:0.097488 |  So it's throw in number three, long throw number three,
[743.56 - 745.08] P:1845.99 E:0.084611 |  these are as good as corners.
[747.28 - 751.24] P:1726.61 E:0.086500 |  Party, standing way off the pitch, a big wind-up.
[751.24 - 755.08] P:1730.37 E:0.097104 |  Here he comes, the long throw with power into the edge of the six-yard box.
[755.08 - 759.80] P:1528.74 E:0.085999 |  Marquinhos heads that away, it's knotted back out by Saliba to Party,
[759.80 - 763.56] P:1791.54 E:0.090888 |  who's able to control this, and Party dummies to cross, then takes it away.
[763.56 - 766.68] P:1713.70 E:0.091848 |  Low balling with his left foot, but straight into the path of...
[768.52 - 771.00] P:1415.24 E:0.104153 |  ...Juaul Neves, who's able to control that,
[771.00 - 776.00] P:1716.79 E:0.091858 |  and between them, Hakimi and Juaul Neves are able to win the throw-in.
[776.00 - 778.36] P:1563.67 E:0.099013 |  Hakimi playing it off Martinelli, and out for a throw.
[778.36 - 781.56] P:1657.04 E:0.099581 |  PSG 0, Arsenal 0, five-life from the BBC.
[781.56 - 784.16] P:1405.91 E:0.085597 |  I like Martinelli's start to the game.
[784.16 - 788.20] P:1551.44 E:0.096722 |  He really has taken it to Hakimi, unsettled him, tried to rough him up.
[788.20 - 791.72] P:1519.70 E:0.091263 |  Every time he's got the ball, he's knocked it outside of him, tried to run.
[791.72 - 795.64] P:1488.79 E:0.092140 |  He's really asking a question of the full-back and putting him under pressure.
[795.64 - 798.48] P:1503.37 E:0.098649 |  Honestly, Matt, PSG have barely been out of their own half.
[798.48 - 801.48] P:1619.88 E:0.085509 |  No, we've always been doing, he's watching to the left, haven't we?
[801.48 - 805.16] P:1634.46 E:0.088005 |  In that half of the pitch, where Arsenal have just been controlling the game.
[805.16 - 807.68] P:1712.69 E:0.084993 |  And in the build-up to this match last week,
[807.68 - 809.52] P:1674.88 E:0.102269 |  certainly over the course of the last couple of days,
[809.52 - 811.76] P:1603.12 E:0.086973 |  when all of the talking has been going on,
[811.76 - 817.08] P:1740.40 E:0.086925 |  I've quite often said that PSG here this season have been almost irresistible.
[817.08 - 820.84] P:1617.49 E:0.087525 |  But Arsenal are hanging their hats on that word, almost.
[820.88 - 823.36] P:1658.68 E:0.113143 |  Here's Martinelli, Martinelli taking on Hakimi,
[823.36 - 827.28] P:1775.47 E:0.085855 |  but that's a win for the Moroccan right-back, strong challenge,
[827.28 - 832.16] P:1628.28 E:0.086378 |  out of play for a throw, but they're being tested in all defensive departments, PSG.
[832.16 - 834.36] P:1482.63 E:0.106563 |  And it's another long throw, this is number four.
[834.36 - 837.04] P:1476.67 E:0.080430 |  I think that is the point, John, they're being tested.
[837.04 - 840.80] P:1526.87 E:0.093129 |  So they've asked who have come here, and they're asking question after question
[840.80 - 843.40] P:1570.31 E:0.088532 |  in a different way, so a very different start from them
[843.40 - 844.92] P:1566.09 E:0.106095 |  than it was in the first leg at home.
[844.92 - 847.24] P:1725.32 E:0.087821 |  It really is a confident, aggressive start.
[847.24 - 850.16] P:1621.15 E:0.076014 |  I mean, this must be what the fifth throw in.
[850.20 - 853.20] P:1761.74 E:0.097917 |  Here we go, it's another long one from Thomas Pardi with a throw.
[853.20 - 857.08] P:1692.55 E:0.085472 |  Flick down, but cleared away by Quaretz-Kalia, packed penalty area,
[857.08 - 861.84] P:1782.72 E:0.085532 |  and the flick, unfortunately for Arsenal, right at the feet of the Georgian.
[861.84 - 865.80] P:1864.98 E:0.087755 |  But Arsenal take up possession again as they play from right to left
[865.80 - 867.88] P:1844.32 E:0.087639 |  as we look here in the first half.
[867.88 - 873.36] P:1849.13 E:0.086808 |  So it is all heads left as Audegarde gives it away.
[873.36 - 878.40] P:1682.50 E:0.096597 |  And then PSG give it away, and Luis Enrique suddenly, all in black tonight.
[878.48 - 882.00] P:1773.67 E:0.089105 |  But from his trainers, his white trainers, he becomes so animated there.
[882.00 - 886.32] P:1864.99 E:0.095308 |  Luis Enrique, his Paris Saint-Germain team who lost in the semifinals last season.
[886.32 - 890.80] P:1852.91 E:0.079110 |  Remember, there's a turn in center field,
[890.80 - 893.48] P:1808.20 E:0.091241 |  and actually there's been a collision there, but Arsenal continue the attack.
[893.48 - 898.24] P:1799.65 E:0.095468 |  Saka tries to take it on, he's claiming the final touch was off the defender,
[898.24 - 901.80] P:1707.92 E:0.086637 |  Pacho, but the assistant on the far side says no free kick.
[901.80 - 904.44] P:1562.94 E:0.091037 |  And was it Declan Rice who collided in center field?
[904.44 - 906.88] P:1569.91 E:0.099434 |  I think it was Declan Rice who chipped the ball out wide.
[906.88 - 910.04] P:1610.41 E:0.094356 |  It might have been Marino actually, I think Rice was arriving in the box,
[910.04 - 912.76] P:1568.98 E:0.093784 |  and Marino had dropped deep to have the ball.
[912.76 - 914.80] P:1622.92 E:0.095352 |  But that's working out really nicely for Arsenal,
[914.80 - 916.76] P:1513.38 E:0.101235 |  because sometimes Rice will go beyond him,
[916.76 - 919.92] P:1503.91 E:0.093729 |  and Marino drops into that familiar midfield role.
[919.92 - 922.04] P:1614.19 E:0.084457 |  It's a really nice interchange for that.
[922.04 - 925.68] P:1561.33 E:0.088366 |  And I think the reaction of Luis Enrique in that technical area,
[925.68 - 930.24] P:1511.38 E:0.091747 |  I mean, he's prowling that and coming out of the area very animated.
[930.24 - 932.92] P:1602.72 E:0.100835 |  Just a little indicator, so early on to be like that,
[932.92 - 935.72] P:1387.18 E:0.080260 |  he's concerned about the start of his team here.
[935.72 - 939.88] P:1590.16 E:0.088478 |  Yes, you can tell that from the body language, it's his birthday tomorrow.
[939.88 - 942.92] P:1628.40 E:0.097900 |  They went out of the Champions League on this day last year,
[942.92 - 944.88] P:1673.51 E:0.100318 |  so they went out of the Champions League in the semi-final
[944.88 - 948.84] P:1715.88 E:0.086129 |  on the eve of his birthday last year, 55 tomorrow.
[948.84 - 951.72] P:1626.06 E:0.092519 |  He was asked yesterday when I went out to the PSG campus,
[951.72 - 953.84] P:1515.32 E:0.088961 |  as they call it, their training ground,
[953.84 - 958.96] P:1544.53 E:0.087301 |  which is out on the edge of the city, out to the west, near Placie.
[958.96 - 963.04] P:1561.71 E:0.101587 |  Very impressive it is, as it's given away by Nuno Mendes.
[963.04 - 967.20] P:1727.21 E:0.098467 |  Now, Martin Ali finds Marino, then to his right, to Odegaard.
[967.20 - 968.80] P:1808.91 E:0.096961 |  Odegaard trying to find a position,
[968.80 - 972.60] P:1655.74 E:0.101807 |  but pass along the edge of the penalty area, wrong decision, gave it away,
[972.60 - 978.08] P:1701.86 E:0.104944 |  couldn't find a teammate, and now it's PSG who break away with the teenager, Duet.
[978.08 - 982.96] P:1770.99 E:0.094487 |  He's carried the ball already 30 yards, but Arsenal are quickly back in position,
[982.96 - 987.76] P:1669.26 E:0.087699 |  and they force him to play it back to little Vettiniya with his hair bobbing,
[987.76 - 990.48] P:1568.14 E:0.093171 |  and the momentum of the breakaways has slowed,
[990.52 - 993.20] P:1493.46 E:0.092793 |  although here is Barclay on the right-hand side,
[993.20 - 999.80] P:1621.04 E:0.092704 |  Bradley Barclay, who has played in every match this season for PSG.
[999.80 - 1003.56] P:1608.86 E:0.085268 |  This is his 54th appearance of the season,
[1003.56 - 1006.76] P:1510.05 E:0.094572 |  whether as a starter or as a very effective substitute.
[1006.76 - 1009.20] P:1426.30 E:0.102483 |  19 goals for him now this season.
[1009.20 - 1013.20] P:1492.76 E:0.088256 |  He scored the PSG goal against Strasbourg on Saturday.
[1013.20 - 1015.16] P:1409.26 E:0.086576 |  We're 16 minutes into the game.
[1015.16 - 1018.96] P:1582.63 E:0.097735 |  It's the first time, I think, where I've felt like PSG have just had control of the ball,
[1018.96 - 1022.16] P:1623.89 E:0.088195 |  or certainly any possession in the Arsenal half.
[1022.16 - 1025.64] P:1505.73 E:0.076752 |  I mean, that's how well Arsenal have started this game.
[1025.64 - 1029.64] P:1685.41 E:0.103769 |  But the frustration for them will be that they weren't able to get the ball into the net,
[1029.64 - 1034.00] P:1738.05 E:0.097971 |  and now Kaveritsch-Kaelya to Duet, back to Kaveritsch-Kaelya on the left-hand side.
[1034.00 - 1037.08] P:1781.21 E:0.111752 |  Straight for Chanoi, hits the post, bounces down,
[1037.08 - 1042.12] P:1653.35 E:0.109276 |  and Lewis Scali was able to get something on that, because Barclay was there,
[1042.12 - 1045.44] P:1685.62 E:0.113618 |  but Lewis Scali was just able to see it back to Raya,
[1045.44 - 1048.48] P:1719.10 E:0.117389 |  with the post from PSG going in front.
[1048.48 - 1052.40] P:1719.06 E:0.096370 |  It's just a horrible sight for a defender,
[1052.40 - 1056.96] P:1653.99 E:0.091358 |  when Kaveritsch-Kaelya is coming inside on his right foot.
[1056.96 - 1060.88] P:1675.86 E:0.106550 |  He can go either way, but when he comes inside there, he's devastated.
[1060.88 - 1063.24] P:1588.84 E:0.104925 |  He gets the angle, what a shot off the post,
[1063.24 - 1066.84] P:1693.28 E:0.089238 |  and that would have been cruel for Arsenal had that gone in the back of the net.
[1066.84 - 1068.76] P:1708.04 E:0.100261 |  I have to say, I thought it was him. Yeah, I did.
[1068.76 - 1073.20] P:1690.44 E:0.104738 |  Given the body language, Kaveritsch-Kaelya, the dive of Raya to his left,
[1073.20 - 1075.12] P:1746.01 E:0.106512 |  and also the reaction of the supporters.
[1075.12 - 1077.60] P:1558.34 E:0.099952 |  He's nearly unstoppable when he's in that zone.
[1077.72 - 1080.56] P:1665.84 E:0.087690 |  The flow and the sway of his upper body,
[1080.56 - 1083.20] P:1617.67 E:0.095886 |  when he's doing those stepovers and dropping his shoulder
[1083.20 - 1085.76] P:1659.19 E:0.083199 |  and creating that half-yard to get the shot off,
[1085.76 - 1088.76] P:1668.79 E:0.086883 |  and then the shot is generally perfectly placed.
[1088.76 - 1090.76] P:1702.49 E:0.103733 |  Ball played forward, the Douay won't reach that,
[1090.76 - 1092.96] P:1904.38 E:0.096432 |  and it bounces away through for a goal kick,
[1092.96 - 1098.16] P:1776.95 E:0.087447 |  bounces into the ever-changing electronic advertising hoardings.
[1098.16 - 1102.16] P:1640.09 E:0.085089 |  I think all of the smoke has just about cleared down.
[1102.16 - 1104.60] P:1644.18 E:0.099734 |  When you look at the lights, you can still see...
[1104.60 - 1106.28] P:1323.21 E:0.109315 |  Still a little bit of it hanging there.
[1106.28 - 1108.08] P:1781.92 E:0.053086 |  In front of the lights.
[1108.08 - 1112.80] P:1648.52 E:0.086164 |  All manner of flags being waved in the ultra's end to have a left.
[1112.80 - 1115.40] P:1612.82 E:0.092047 |  The PSG nil, Arsenal nil,
[1115.40 - 1120.52] P:1644.93 E:0.089022 |  one nil to the French champions as Arsenal come forward again.
[1120.52 - 1128.04] P:1851.76 E:0.097370 |  Timber, who's in field, and a yellow card is being shown.
[1128.04 - 1130.36] P:1883.45 E:0.095387 |  It's Mendes, isn't it? Is it Nuno Mendes?
[1130.36 - 1134.04] P:1760.25 E:0.083520 |  I think it is. Who's protesting to the referee.
[1134.04 - 1135.28] P:1593.20 E:0.097182 |  So that's interesting.
[1135.28 - 1137.60] P:1353.74 E:0.099901 |  That's a positive thing for Arsenal.
[1137.60 - 1140.00] P:1574.35 E:0.093835 |  Yeah, now Saka is going to be up against Nuno Mendes
[1140.00 - 1142.20] P:1827.16 E:0.107533 |  on an early yellow card, 18 minutes play.
[1142.20 - 1145.44] P:1971.32 E:0.098717 |  Yeah, he went to ground to try and win the ball, didn't win the ball,
[1145.44 - 1146.84] P:2005.52 E:0.082408 |  and just caught his studs.
[1146.84 - 1148.44] P:1800.80 E:0.091445 |  It was a little bit of a reckless tackle,
[1148.44 - 1152.96] P:1889.83 E:0.088817 |  and the referee has come over and punished it early with a yellow card.
[1152.96 - 1154.36] P:1907.84 E:0.091134 |  I mean, he's not best happy about it.
[1154.36 - 1159.36] P:1875.23 E:0.071078 |  He just catches the foot of Timber as he's driving past him.
[1159.36 - 1160.60] P:1773.27 E:0.100053 |  It's not a horrendous tackle,
[1160.60 - 1162.60] P:1799.67 E:0.109722 |  but I can understand why the yellow cards come out.
[1162.60 - 1165.52] P:1787.62 E:0.096990 |  Now they've got to get in one-to-one with Saka more often.
[1165.52 - 1169.88] P:1927.87 E:0.089311 |  So immediately, free-kick taken, and it's given by Reis to Saka.
[1169.88 - 1172.56] P:1857.30 E:0.091532 |  Then back to Reis, though, and it comes out to Martin Ali.
[1172.56 - 1176.04] P:1788.09 E:0.093818 |  Chests it down, but shoots into the crowded edge of the penalty area.
[1176.04 - 1179.60] P:1747.25 E:0.104528 |  And then excellent footwork from Vettini, dragged the ball back,
[1179.60 - 1181.64] P:1702.28 E:0.099791 |  killed the pass forward, but well defended,
[1181.64 - 1186.56] P:1793.14 E:0.085871 |  as Matt Upson says by Miles Lewis, Skelly, against Hakimi.
[1186.56 - 1191.36] P:1745.88 E:0.102781 |  And the margins for Ero were very fine for Lewis Skelly there,
[1191.36 - 1193.60] P:1802.22 E:0.096083 |  as Timber bounces into a challenge.
[1193.60 - 1195.80] P:1911.80 E:0.099841 |  Now he has Saka again on the far side.
[1195.80 - 1197.60] P:1835.05 E:0.091961 |  Ord, as well, comes in fill-up.
[1197.60 - 1199.28] P:1673.31 E:0.112192 |  He might have been caught by Joan Neves,
[1199.28 - 1201.60] P:1658.79 E:0.089254 |  but referee Zvaya's not interested in that.
[1201.60 - 1204.60] P:1664.45 E:0.095209 |  PSG have got it back on the edge of the penalty area, and it's still 0-0.
[1204.60 - 1207.28] P:1635.33 E:0.091514 |  Yeah, he's taken quite a hard line with the game, the referee.
[1207.28 - 1209.72] P:1620.59 E:0.110992 |  There's a couple of things that you might have considered a foul,
[1209.72 - 1211.20] P:1753.35 E:0.109262 |  and he's just waved play on.
[1211.20 - 1214.32] P:1679.69 E:0.104310 |  But that little piece of defending from Lewis Skelly there, John,
[1214.32 - 1216.52] P:1686.86 E:0.098898 |  I can't tell you how difficult that was.
[1216.52 - 1219.24] P:1708.77 E:0.101333 |  The ball's bouncing over your head, you're running back towards your own goal,
[1219.24 - 1220.84] P:1666.48 E:0.098516 |  you're around the halfway line,
[1220.88 - 1223.76] P:1633.64 E:0.086178 |  you've got a player with the pace of Barca,
[1223.76 - 1228.08] P:1568.83 E:0.089631 |  they're bearing down on you, and you manage, he uses his body
[1228.08 - 1231.44] P:1676.48 E:0.085532 |  in such a mature fashion, this young player.
[1231.44 - 1237.08] P:1609.66 E:0.089863 |  He just gets his hips and his back, and his backside around to shield the ball,
[1237.08 - 1239.44] P:1564.25 E:0.083988 |  and then swivels out with it, it was a lovely piece of defending.
[1239.44 - 1243.40] P:1611.06 E:0.085704 |  And there's another excellent tackle by Timber on Claret's calia.
[1243.40 - 1246.60] P:1788.03 E:0.077249 |  You know, the feel at the moment is good for Arsenal.
[1246.60 - 1249.08] P:1719.04 E:0.100236 |  You know, there's some impressive duels being won.
[1249.72 - 1253.52] P:1869.70 E:0.083115 |  By Arsenal players in many areas of the field,
[1253.52 - 1256.96] P:1843.76 E:0.081967 |  and this belief that they talked about yesterday,
[1256.96 - 1261.32] P:1792.01 E:0.080550 |  well, they are producing so far, but still no goal.
[1261.32 - 1262.76] P:1651.22 E:0.068338 |  20 minutes played.
[1262.76 - 1265.00] P:1586.20 E:0.098042 |  Arsenal going back to party on the halfway line,
[1265.00 - 1268.20] P:1656.75 E:0.084977 |  here's Lewis Skelly in a central position, just drags it back
[1268.20 - 1271.32] P:1592.14 E:0.081471 |  and plays it back to the halfway line.
[1271.32 - 1274.24] P:1658.76 E:0.073880 |  Audegarde up to the right,
[1274.24 - 1277.48] P:1671.51 E:0.089749 |  and then they will go back to the halfway line again.
[1277.52 - 1283.72] P:1715.20 E:0.089241 |  So, Nel Nel, this night that is a giant fork in the road to Munich.
[1283.72 - 1287.48] P:1854.90 E:0.091130 |  Audegarde coming in from the right, thought about shooting, but didn't.
[1287.48 - 1290.92] P:1854.75 E:0.097006 |  In the end, thought he might have one goal from the edge of the area.
[1290.92 - 1293.80] P:1815.58 E:0.093889 |  Instead, it's Martin Ely, Martin Ely taking on Hikini,
[1293.80 - 1297.24] P:1786.08 E:0.091518 |  who gets his foot in, the ball rolls away behind for a corner.
[1297.24 - 1299.92] P:1754.08 E:0.082997 |  Is that the point about Martin Ely there?
[1299.92 - 1304.64] P:1894.52 E:0.092296 |  John just did so well, drove with the ball, went past two players,
[1304.64 - 1308.20] P:1872.07 E:0.086244 |  got the momentum, then has that stepping side of the pitch a little bit more,
[1308.20 - 1312.40] P:1869.68 E:0.080873 |  he's got a lovely angle to just let that left foot go,
[1312.40 - 1314.80] P:1965.42 E:0.079095 |  and he chooses to offload it.
[1314.80 - 1320.20] P:1887.11 E:0.087669 |  That to me is, get that shot off, he's more than capable of scoring at that point.
[1320.20 - 1323.28] P:1958.90 E:0.090806 |  Corner then, from the left, for Arsenal.
[1323.28 - 1328.08] P:1958.06 E:0.089358 |  This is corner number three, Donnarumma, just waits on his line,
[1328.08 - 1331.40] P:1951.12 E:0.098120 |  orange-backed gloves, his arms dangled by his sides,
[1331.40 - 1333.28] P:1899.31 E:0.092805 |  then Arsenal players run in all directions.
[1333.32 - 1337.20] P:1776.54 E:0.098436 |  Here's the delivery, a little glance out to the edge of the area, PSG head on that,
[1337.20 - 1339.16] P:1759.46 E:0.098809 |  order guard, couldn't get the shot in.
[1339.16 - 1342.64] P:1780.04 E:0.092192 |  Lewis Skelly heads it forward to the edge of the box, Saka tried to lay it off,
[1342.64 - 1346.60] P:1750.10 E:0.087750 |  bounces back to Saka, who works the pass forward, that's a nice touch from Marino.
[1346.60 - 1349.16] P:1823.35 E:0.097927 |  Now the ball in from the right-hand side, from Timber,
[1349.16 - 1354.68] P:1697.34 E:0.101250 |  but it's too close to Donnarumma, who's able just to allow the ball to bounce up into his midriff.
[1354.68 - 1357.52] P:1553.33 E:0.104891 |  Yeah, the snap into the tackle's good from Arsenal, the loose ball,
[1357.52 - 1361.28] P:1584.22 E:0.104269 |  anything that's dropping in the midfield is a bit of a bouncing ball,
[1361.28 - 1363.00] P:1567.50 E:0.086379 |  where two players are battling.
[1363.00 - 1367.28] P:1577.00 E:0.090492 |  I have to say, at the moment they're coming out on more of those duels on top,
[1367.28 - 1370.16] P:1624.39 E:0.093359 |  and that's the problem for PSG, they're just not getting hold of the ball,
[1370.16 - 1372.60] P:1703.22 E:0.092879 |  because Arsenal are just turning it over like they have done just now.
[1372.60 - 1375.88] P:1620.42 E:0.089159 |  Giving away again, Hakimi under pressure from Martin Ely.
[1375.88 - 1381.04] P:1581.66 E:0.084927 |  Arsenal players working tremendously hard, and it comes back into the centre-circle.
[1381.04 - 1384.64] P:1756.28 E:0.112075 |  Oh, and that's a little short to Kivio, the pass from Saliba,
[1384.64 - 1390.12] P:1739.08 E:0.111216 |  now Barcalo's away, and then Douay, edge of the area, Douay shoots weakly.
[1390.16 - 1393.88] P:1625.65 E:0.107707 |  And Raya was able to go down to his right and save that, really.
[1393.88 - 1398.20] P:1676.86 E:0.095294 |  And routine save, it opened up for PSG though, but they couldn't take advantage.
[1398.20 - 1402.08] P:1530.07 E:0.093921 |  Well, Julien Laurent said the words before the game,
[1402.08 - 1405.84] P:1493.14 E:0.088309 |  Saliba can't have a mistake, like he did against Madrid,
[1405.84 - 1409.28] P:1451.24 E:0.087508 |  like he did in the Premier League recently as well,
[1409.28 - 1416.04] P:1670.92 E:0.085093 |  and that was very much of that ilk, what a dangerous ball to play.
[1416.04 - 1419.60] P:1647.03 E:0.090426 |  It gets cut out, and really, Arsenal should have been punished.
[1419.60 - 1422.84] P:1469.76 E:0.093728 |  It was a soft finish in the end from Douay.
[1422.84 - 1426.80] P:1579.36 E:0.088534 |  He should do better, but Saliba very lucky to be let off the hook there.
[1426.80 - 1428.84] P:1551.52 E:0.096666 |  Yes, the Crystal Palace match, wasn't it?
[1428.84 - 1429.84] P:1575.69 E:0.098211 |  It was, yes.
[1429.84 - 1433.68] P:1547.35 E:0.083678 |  And Mateta scored so well in the 2-2 draw.
[1433.68 - 1438.88] P:1619.79 E:0.094128 |  Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal, Arsenal have won their last four away matches
[1438.88 - 1442.40] P:1492.27 E:0.093220 |  in the Champions League, they'd never won five in a row away from home.
[1442.40 - 1447.00] P:1496.59 E:0.082196 |  Yeah, well, just hopefully that's his mistake with the ball out of the way there, John.
[1447.00 - 1449.16] P:1564.12 E:0.081568 |  Declan Rice in possession.
[1449.24 - 1451.60] P:1484.31 E:0.099062 |  He had an early chance as well with a header, didn't he?
[1451.60 - 1453.40] P:1711.39 E:0.089575 |  Which was Arsenal's first opportunity.
[1453.40 - 1456.04] P:1492.02 E:0.092828 |  Saliba then playing the ball forward to Marino,
[1456.04 - 1460.44] P:1678.23 E:0.084936 |  no tross-hard in the team tonight, forward to Lewis Skelly.
[1460.44 - 1464.04] P:1628.43 E:0.092954 |  Now on the left-hand side, from Timber, actually, the pass out to Martin Ellie,
[1464.04 - 1466.04] P:1865.13 E:0.099550 |  Lewis Skelly on the overlap to his left,
[1466.04 - 1468.44] P:1871.57 E:0.094994 |  but he comes back in field with the ball to Odegaard.
[1468.44 - 1471.08] P:1915.63 E:0.093483 |  Odegaard goes right, then back out to the left again.
[1471.08 - 1474.60] P:1827.21 E:0.102363 |  Lewis Skelly, left foot across, that's very high, I think he's over-hitted.
[1474.60 - 1477.36] P:1786.54 E:0.086856 |  No, it's still in play, but it's over the top of Saka,
[1477.40 - 1480.44] P:1705.99 E:0.095904 |  and then Nuno Mendes goes in on the challenge,
[1480.44 - 1482.56] P:1778.73 E:0.083514 |  goes sprawling down.
[1482.56 - 1484.44] P:1520.57 E:0.102767 |  Did he win the free kick or is it a throwing?
[1484.44 - 1486.04] P:1599.79 E:0.093267 |  Yes, I think it's a free kick to PSG.
[1486.04 - 1489.64] P:1466.09 E:0.089343 |  It is a free kick, but just how audacious that is from Mendes
[1489.64 - 1493.32] P:1444.78 E:0.094130 |  to actually run around Saka to try and win that ball
[1493.32 - 1498.28] P:1425.58 E:0.092421 |  is just a sign of the confidence that this PSG left back
[1498.28 - 1502.92] P:1446.55 E:0.096644 |  has in himself physically and with his pace to dominate anyone.
[1502.92 - 1506.44] P:1558.76 E:0.095103 |  And I have to say, on the whole, I don't see him get beaten.
[1506.52 - 1509.88] P:1629.20 E:0.098062 |  I think he's the best in the world at the moment in that left-back position.
[1511.76 - 1514.12] P:1582.68 E:0.100374 |  So, 0-0 it is.
[1514.12 - 1518.60] P:1254.21 E:0.089411 |  Arsenal, who, as we mentioned last week,
[1518.60 - 1523.84] P:1460.20 E:0.095072 |  have not scored now in their last six semi-final matches.
[1523.84 - 1528.16] P:1583.73 E:0.104735 |  PSG with it at the back, but that's given away by Marquinhos.
[1528.16 - 1532.68] P:1745.56 E:0.094830 |  More groans, and Lewis Skelly's able to take it on towards the edge
[1532.68 - 1538.00] P:1658.53 E:0.097170 |  of the penalty area, but then blue, red and white shirts converge on him.
[1538.00 - 1539.84] P:1502.73 E:0.101751 |  It's brought away by Fabian Ruiz,
[1539.84 - 1542.88] P:1717.95 E:0.114785 |  and Vettini has to hold off Audicard, but he's got support
[1542.88 - 1546.52] P:1643.83 E:0.098799 |  and help from Saka, and Saka takes it on, but then going central.
[1546.52 - 1550.68] P:1586.26 E:0.103531 |  He ran into Vettini, Fabian Ruiz, passes it to Hakimi.
[1550.68 - 1553.76] P:1434.39 E:0.098984 |  Arsenal now need to get their defensive heads on again,
[1553.76 - 1556.76] P:1381.21 E:0.102223 |  do it back to Hakimi, but PSG go back into their own heart.
[1556.76 - 1561.12] P:1478.46 E:0.103283 |  There's just a breakaway goal feeling around this match at the moment.
[1561.12 - 1563.92] P:1558.67 E:0.102383 |  Arsenal, it's almost too good to be true, John,
[1563.92 - 1566.08] P:1559.98 E:0.096780 |  in terms of how they're managing the game,
[1566.08 - 1570.56] P:1558.64 E:0.092856 |  and you just feel that Paris are going to have a breakaway situation,
[1570.56 - 1573.36] P:1472.92 E:0.084972 |  just like the one they have with the mistake from Saliba.
[1573.36 - 1574.96] P:1362.89 E:0.107175 |  That is the risk that Arsenal are running here.
[1574.96 - 1577.36] P:1478.90 E:0.097354 |  They're almost being too dominant with the ball,
[1577.36 - 1579.16] P:1553.90 E:0.088721 |  and you've got so many players committed forward
[1579.16 - 1582.08] P:1437.01 E:0.085819 |  that when it breaks down on the edge of the Paris box,
[1582.08 - 1583.16] P:1485.47 E:0.109285 |  they can be in big trouble,
[1583.16 - 1587.04] P:1492.17 E:0.083021 |  because they've got such good quality in place in the front three.
[1587.08 - 1590.08] P:1708.79 E:0.118251 |  There's Arsenal playing it out from the back.
[1590.08 - 1594.68] P:1727.46 E:0.110226 |  Raya passing it to Declan Rice, who had...
[1596.04 - 1598.48] P:1758.55 E:0.109191 |  ...Kvaritz-Kirlia all over him.
[1598.48 - 1601.68] P:1834.03 E:0.096782 |  It's a heavy touch from Rice, from Raya's ball out,
[1601.68 - 1605.00] P:1657.96 E:0.093489 |  and Rice has fouled Kvaritz-Kirlia,
[1605.00 - 1607.88] P:1570.34 E:0.095284 |  and it's a yellow card for the Arsenal midfielder.
[1607.88 - 1611.28] P:1479.41 E:0.088200 |  I'm not too keen on the pass out in that area.
[1611.28 - 1614.56] P:1565.15 E:0.108522 |  Well, that's gone wrong for Arsenal several times recently as well.
[1614.60 - 1617.32] P:1502.44 E:0.099624 |  Again, for me, that's a managed the game a bit.
[1617.32 - 1621.24] P:1472.67 E:0.095890 |  I mean, Rice, a pass into him is on, but you've got to bear in mind,
[1621.24 - 1623.36] P:1597.79 E:0.096083 |  even if he has a perfect touch there, John,
[1623.36 - 1624.92] P:1546.70 E:0.092806 |  what's he going to do with the ball?
[1624.92 - 1627.56] P:1594.44 E:0.097297 |  He's running back towards the corner of his own eight-in-yard box.
[1627.56 - 1632.16] P:1490.41 E:0.093252 |  He's got a group of players really in a high press after him.
[1632.16 - 1634.48] P:1481.77 E:0.104872 |  I don't think he can really wriggle out that with the best touch ever.
[1634.48 - 1636.40] P:1513.24 E:0.097067 |  He didn't have a good touch, which is why he made the foul,
[1636.40 - 1640.28] P:1509.90 E:0.087083 |  but it's not a pass from me that David Raya should consider at that moment.
[1640.28 - 1642.28] P:1549.97 E:0.102273 |  So it's a yellow card apiece now,
[1642.32 - 1646.00] P:1474.54 E:0.090503 |  for Declan Rice for Arsenal and Mendes for PSG,
[1646.00 - 1649.92] P:1420.55 E:0.092950 |  but this is a free kick, good position, Vatinya has over the ball.
[1650.92 - 1655.92] P:1479.46 E:0.096514 |  And Arsenal holding the line probably a couple of yards inside there, half.
[1655.92 - 1658.32] P:1528.16 E:0.097403 |  Barrett-Kirlia comes across with his hand up to his mouth
[1658.32 - 1661.80] P:1421.33 E:0.085152 |  and whispers something to Vatinya.
[1661.80 - 1664.36] P:1625.97 E:0.095645 |  Right-footed free kick towards the back post,
[1664.36 - 1666.24] P:1685.99 E:0.102835 |  that's headed out by party to the edge of the area.
[1666.24 - 1667.32] P:1833.92 E:0.118478 |  Fabian Ruiz!
[1667.32 - 1668.92] P:1763.41 E:0.114123 |  So he scores!
[1669.92 - 1674.92] P:1730.09 E:0.120818 |  Fabian Ruiz makes it one-nil on the night to Paris Saint-Germain.
[1674.92 - 1679.92] P:1666.29 E:0.117532 |  And for all of Arsenal's pressure, for all of their chances,
[1679.92 - 1682.92] P:1671.75 E:0.111906 |  it's the French champions who take the lead.
[1684.92 - 1689.92] P:1710.14 E:0.115355 |  He drove it powerfully for a crowd of players past the dive of Raya.
[1689.92 - 1692.92] P:1549.65 E:0.105436 |  It's one-nil to Paris Saint-Germain on the night.
[1692.92 - 1696.92] P:1598.49 E:0.112960 |  They've doubled their lead in the tie, two-nil on aggregate.
[1697.92 - 1700.92] P:1727.92 E:0.107493 |  What a hit from Fabian Ruiz.
[1700.92 - 1704.92] P:1662.44 E:0.103053 |  You can't take anything away from the quality of this strike,
[1704.92 - 1708.92] P:1546.17 E:0.098313 |  but it's another set play that Arsenal don't defend well enough.
[1708.92 - 1711.92] P:1523.07 E:0.104929 |  OK, Thomas' party wins the first header,
[1711.92 - 1715.92] P:1542.42 E:0.104353 |  but he heads the ball back right into that edge of the box danger area,
[1715.92 - 1718.92] P:1539.12 E:0.106170 |  where his PSG players just lurking.
[1718.92 - 1721.92] P:1368.30 E:0.099441 |  Martin Ely then just gets sucked in.
[1721.92 - 1725.92] P:1445.00 E:0.104756 |  He's running across the box, where he's just got to put the brakes on.
[1725.92 - 1729.92] P:1435.72 E:0.102363 |  Not try and win the ball, but just stop Fabian Ruiz
[1729.92 - 1732.92] P:1467.30 E:0.093805 |  from getting any kind of control on the ball,
[1732.92 - 1734.92] P:1556.05 E:0.089231 |  but he runs way past him.
[1734.92 - 1737.92] P:1608.50 E:0.090115 |  The touch to his left foot off his chest is brilliant.
[1737.92 - 1741.92] P:1644.70 E:0.087319 |  The ball is bouncing, and the strike, I mean, he really swings
[1741.92 - 1744.92] P:1529.48 E:0.100807 |  that left foot at the ball, but he gets a perfect connection,
[1744.92 - 1746.92] P:1390.59 E:0.105739 |  and it just drills past Raya.
[1746.92 - 1748.92] P:1670.70 E:0.101532 |  He's got no chance really of reacting.
[1748.92 - 1753.92] P:1530.55 E:0.096593 |  It's a brilliant finish, but you feel it's a goal that Arsenal should defend better.
[1753.92 - 1754.92] P:1220.03 E:0.091298 |  Yeah.
[1754.92 - 1756.92] P:1563.06 E:0.118644 |  They'll be kicking themselves.
[1756.92 - 1759.92] P:1512.01 E:0.108873 |  The way that they con... You know, the ball out from Raya,
[1759.92 - 1761.92] P:1493.12 E:0.097076 |  the conceding of the free kick.
[1761.92 - 1764.92] P:1432.23 E:0.085233 |  That defensive header from party...
[1764.92 - 1766.92] P:1514.50 E:0.083574 |  That's the difference.
[1766.92 - 1770.92] P:1441.02 E:0.100443 |  Those decisions, that game management experience at this level,
[1770.92 - 1772.92] P:1474.93 E:0.097650 |  they're the difference.
[1772.92 - 1775.92] P:1425.15 E:0.084722 |  Bringing that situation on themselves didn't need to happen.
[1775.92 - 1779.92] P:1616.58 E:0.087852 |  Quite the contrast, the way that PSG have...
[1779.92 - 1782.92] P:1720.15 E:0.092433 |  have soaked up the pressure, and some pressure from Arsenal as well,
[1782.92 - 1785.92] P:1464.51 E:0.088161 |  but Arsenal couldn't find a way through.
[1785.92 - 1789.92] P:1641.56 E:0.093112 |  Donoruma making the saves, and now the explosions of flares,
[1789.92 - 1795.92] P:1729.27 E:0.089321 |  and the smoke pours down out of the stand behind the goal to our left.
[1795.92 - 1797.92] P:1709.28 E:0.089813 |  Audegarde crossing for Arsenal, to the back post.
[1797.92 - 1801.92] P:1578.58 E:0.090765 |  That's headed down, but cleared away by Marquinhos on the edge of the area.
[1801.92 - 1803.92] P:1582.38 E:0.087812 |  Back to Sacher on the right-hand side,
[1803.92 - 1806.92] P:1622.99 E:0.089920 |  so Arsenal now 2-0 down in the tie.
[1806.92 - 1810.92] P:1776.46 E:0.080756 |  This match tonight, they've got to win tonight, and they're losing.
[1810.92 - 1812.92] P:1635.18 E:0.104019 |  1-0 at home, 1-0 away.
[1812.92 - 1815.92] P:1727.26 E:0.118726 |  That's given away by Lewis Skelly.
[1815.92 - 1818.92] P:1775.48 E:0.107323 |  Gwarris-Galer takes it on, passes it to Barcala,
[1818.92 - 1823.92] P:1753.47 E:0.104595 |  Barcala beats Lewis Skelly, and shoots and saves by Raya.
[1823.92 - 1827.92] P:1708.46 E:0.102707 |  As Rice came in with the challenge, Barcala couldn't finish.
[1827.92 - 1831.92] P:1777.53 E:0.101133 |  And if he had finished, that might have been Arsenal finished.
[1831.92 - 1836.92] P:1574.07 E:0.102579 |  Come on, the game is going in a style that's just really suit in PSG.
[1836.92 - 1839.92] P:1672.91 E:0.099989 |  Arsenal have started very well, they had so much of the ball,
[1839.92 - 1842.92] P:1492.64 E:0.108834 |  but when there's a mistake or a slightly short pass,
[1842.92 - 1847.92] P:1379.58 E:0.108691 |  wow, their counter-attack is swift, it's decisive,
[1847.92 - 1852.92] P:1505.32 E:0.104634 |  it's so sharp, and really, they should have had two goals on the break already,
[1852.92 - 1855.92] P:1485.45 E:0.105978 |  and it's only Declan Rice that manages to get back to stop the shot.
[1855.92 - 1857.92] P:1601.30 E:0.116972 |  Here's the corner, Douay pulls it to the edge of the area,
[1857.92 - 1860.92] P:1670.30 E:0.095619 |  Hakini's right underneath that, though has Sacher challenged him
[1860.92 - 1863.92] P:1597.15 E:0.096839 |  and hoisted the shot high over the top,
[1863.92 - 1868.92] P:1610.16 E:0.085685 |  actually landed on this blue carpet that is behind the goal,
[1868.92 - 1872.92] P:1567.96 E:0.093012 |  and all around the pitch, this PSG blue, massive badge,
[1872.92 - 1877.92] P:1541.93 E:0.088098 |  Paris Saint-Germain, that landed right in the middle of the R of Paris.
[1877.92 - 1881.92] P:1767.21 E:0.096557 |  So 1-0 to PSG, Fabian Ruiz, the goal scorer,
[1881.92 - 1886.92] P:1638.03 E:0.088552 |  the Spanish international part of the team that won the Euros last year,
[1886.92 - 1888.92] P:1725.12 E:0.086099 |  an important part of that team,
[1888.92 - 1892.92] P:1766.21 E:0.088442 |  that's his first goal in the Champions League this season for Paris Saint-Germain,
[1892.92 - 1894.92] P:1603.58 E:0.099167 |  and what an important one it was.
[1894.92 - 1899.92] P:1810.55 E:0.092307 |  PSG's eyes now, very much closing in on Munich and the final against Inter
[1899.92 - 1905.92] P:1900.67 E:0.089232 |  at the end of the month, Saturday the 31st, it is, on the evening of,
[1905.92 - 1910.92] P:1966.36 E:0.087407 |  and Arsenal, the task has just got a great deal harder,
[1910.92 - 1912.92] P:1894.90 E:0.101715 |  and yes, they had chances,
[1912.92 - 1914.92] P:1948.35 E:0.082921 |  Voritz Kehle with his shot against the post,
[1914.92 - 1921.92] P:1771.62 E:0.090804 |  the chance as well, that Douay had when he shot weakly at Raya,
[1922.92 - 1925.92] P:1803.05 E:0.091463 |  but the opening goal, the crucial opening goal,
[1925.92 - 1927.92] P:1811.99 E:0.091720 |  has gone to Lewis-Henry Fez-Tin.
[1927.92 - 1930.92] P:1747.08 E:0.089176 |  The scary thing is, John, they've had all those chances,
[1930.92 - 1932.92] P:1557.03 E:0.074882 |  and they barely had the ball,
[1932.92 - 1935.92] P:1579.41 E:0.086752 |  and that's what makes them an incredible team,
[1935.92 - 1937.92] P:1410.03 E:0.089897 |  because yes, they can pop it around and build,
[1937.92 - 1940.92] P:1424.45 E:0.084324 |  but they're absolutely lethal in situations like this,
[1940.92 - 1943.92] P:1621.79 E:0.092296 |  when you've got to come out, you've got to try and press
[1943.92 - 1946.92] P:1742.27 E:0.086381 |  and force the issue like Arsenal have to be in a goal down,
[1946.92 - 1948.92] P:1792.36 E:0.077891 |  two goals down now,
[1948.92 - 1951.92] P:1800.64 E:0.085746 |  but they become even more dangerous in this situation.
[1951.92 - 1956.92] P:1633.32 E:0.093630 |  They do, as Kebarat's Kehle and the mood has changed as well.
[1956.92 - 1959.92] P:1723.78 E:0.097513 |  Inside the stadium here, we're setting high up,
[1959.92 - 1961.92] P:1621.58 E:0.101289 |  just for the right of the halfway line,
[1961.92 - 1964.92] P:1204.87 E:0.107578 |  looking down on Lewis-Henry, Michael Arteger is out there as well,
[1964.92 - 1968.92] P:1386.41 E:0.108131 |  various hand signals, now he looks exasperated as well,
[1968.92 - 1971.92] P:1395.05 E:0.113345 |  Arsenal coming forward though, Timber with a cross,
[1971.92 - 1974.92] P:1534.65 E:0.102554 |  it's a deep one, Rice backs away, Rice heads it across,
[1974.92 - 1978.92] P:1520.06 E:0.108939 |  hook goal, it's by Marino, but it drops wide of the top right corner,
[1978.92 - 1982.92] P:1536.25 E:0.104703 |  with Donnaroma scumploring across his six-yard box,
[1982.92 - 1985.92] P:1468.26 E:0.111110 |  it's behind, it's a goal kick, and this noise now,
[1985.92 - 1987.92] P:1415.76 E:0.104287 |  listen to this, inside this stadium,
[1987.92 - 1992.92] P:1448.56 E:0.096934 |  the sound of a jubilant, aboyant Paris Saint-Germain.
[1993.92 - 1997.92] P:1460.01 E:0.096367 |  Arsenal have had all the ball, but PSG have had all the moments,
[1997.92 - 2002.92] P:1401.06 E:0.096880 |  and I clue Donnaroma in that, two cracking early saves in this game,
[2002.92 - 2006.92] P:1455.01 E:0.097222 |  when they're under real pressure, and then the attacking play that's followed after,
[2006.92 - 2009.92] P:1396.96 E:0.079760 |  you know, that's the difference in this game,
[2009.92 - 2013.92] P:1460.92 E:0.093548 |  their players have really stepped up in those moments and produced something.
[2015.92 - 2017.92] P:1628.63 E:0.094210 |  Goal kick from Donnaroma, forward from Rice,
[2017.92 - 2020.92] P:1768.68 E:0.094919 |  but that will just run away for PSG, Hakimi chasing it,
[2020.92 - 2023.92] P:1540.31 E:0.096541 |  and there is the feeling here, inside the stadium,
[2023.92 - 2027.92] P:1513.70 E:0.082038 |  there is the feeling that PSG have weathered the storm.
[2028.92 - 2031.92] P:1767.67 E:0.094450 |  But Arsenal have got other ideas, here's Rice,
[2031.92 - 2034.92] P:1788.57 E:0.088139 |  Rice receives it from Audegarde, stretching forward,
[2034.92 - 2036.92] P:1718.48 E:0.096243 |  passes it to Martin, early on the left-hand side,
[2036.92 - 2039.92] P:1704.93 E:0.103581 |  got a shove in the back there, as a result of that,
[2039.92 - 2042.92] P:1726.90 E:0.089596 |  carried the ball out of play, he'd gone down,
[2042.92 - 2045.92] P:1628.11 E:0.086436 |  he might have won a free kick, but it's a goal kick to PSG.
[2045.92 - 2050.92] P:1513.39 E:0.090383 |  Let me just tell you as well, that over the course of history
[2050.92 - 2053.92] P:1556.46 E:0.101917 |  in the Champions League, there have been only two cases of teams
[2053.92 - 2057.92] P:1444.12 E:0.090282 |  who have lost the first leg at home,
[2057.92 - 2061.92] P:1478.93 E:0.095435 |  yet still gone on to win that semi-final and get through to the final.
[2061.92 - 2064.92] P:1483.81 E:0.092838 |  And this is where I'm offering a crumb of hope here,
[2064.92 - 2066.92] P:1552.71 E:0.105216 |  because the most recent of them was Tottenham,
[2066.92 - 2068.92] P:1483.17 E:0.084881 |  against Ajax back in 2019.
[2068.92 - 2072.92] P:1524.55 E:0.087393 |  They lost 1-0 at home, against Ajax, if you remember,
[2072.92 - 2076.92] P:1636.36 E:0.090374 |  and then went 2-0 down on the night, so they were 3-0 down,
[2076.92 - 2079.92] P:1621.49 E:0.092410 |  and then Lukas Moura came and scored the hat-trick in the second half,
[2079.92 - 2081.92] P:1596.32 E:0.088106 |  so let's not give it up just yet.
[2081.92 - 2084.92] P:1621.28 E:0.078985 |  No, but it took one of the craziest moments in European football
[2084.92 - 2086.92] P:1585.48 E:0.086567 |  to make that happen, didn't it, to turn that around,
[2086.92 - 2088.92] P:1664.62 E:0.089186 |  and that's what Arsenal need now.
[2088.92 - 2092.92] P:1667.09 E:0.094140 |  Yep, six years ago, tomorrow, that was, so that means six years ago today,
[2092.92 - 2095.92] P:1494.94 E:0.096473 |  was Liverpool's comeback against Barcelona the night before.
[2095.92 - 2100.92] P:1615.84 E:0.081944 |  PSG with a ball with Pacho in his left-back area, chips it forward,
[2100.92 - 2103.92] P:1647.98 E:0.092254 |  and it drifts out of play, and after all of that smoke cleared,
[2103.92 - 2105.92] P:1560.05 E:0.088375 |  we're back to square one, aren't we?
[2105.92 - 2109.92] P:1482.93 E:0.090724 |  Still one red flare is burning away in the top tier.
[2109.92 - 2113.92] P:1479.77 E:0.088605 |  I'm sure they've got their plans already, these PSG supporters,
[2113.92 - 2117.92] P:1510.85 E:0.094371 |  and they will bring real life to Munich for that final,
[2117.92 - 2120.92] P:1562.98 E:0.073183 |  if that were to be the case.
[2120.92 - 2126.92] P:1580.66 E:0.088428 |  Arsenal in the PSG left-back area, but that breaks down, PSG have got it back,
[2126.92 - 2131.92] P:1630.77 E:0.092651 |  and Kavara Takeda dancing forward with the ball, he's fouled,
[2131.92 - 2134.92] P:1685.29 E:0.100105 |  and that's a free kick to the home side, halfway inside the wrong half,
[2134.92 - 2136.92] P:1638.04 E:0.104889 |  so 10 minutes to go to halftime, Matt.
[2136.92 - 2140.92] P:1528.65 E:0.096521 |  PSG won Arsenal, 0-2, they're long aggregate.
[2140.92 - 2144.92] P:1472.38 E:0.093518 |  Difficult situation for Arsenal now, and they've just got to be careful,
[2144.92 - 2149.92] P:1505.50 E:0.097590 |  the body language doesn't change, the belief is still there.
[2149.92 - 2155.92] P:1505.03 E:0.093114 |  There's two goals that they need to find now in this incredibly difficult situation
[2155.92 - 2158.92] P:1457.69 E:0.083469 |  against a team that is so hot on the break,
[2158.92 - 2164.92] P:1491.51 E:0.091456 |  they really aren't any slipped pass or misread or weight of passes wrong,
[2164.92 - 2167.92] P:1557.06 E:0.085648 |  they're on it, and they've got runners going forward,
[2167.92 - 2169.92] P:1546.54 E:0.078558 |  so they've got to be aware of that Arsenal,
[2169.92 - 2172.92] P:1578.93 E:0.093677 |  they just want to have a good 10 minutes into halftime and then regroup.
[2172.92 - 2176.92] P:1716.67 E:0.099157 |  Arsenal win the ball back, over there on the far side, Saka now direct running
[2176.92 - 2179.92] P:1767.48 E:0.093953 |  towards the edge of the penalty area, Cross comes in from the right-hand side,
[2179.92 - 2182.92] P:1683.68 E:0.094100 |  it's deflected, only half headed away by Patro after Rice put the ball in,
[2182.92 - 2186.92] P:1692.36 E:0.109632 |  Rice chases him over there out into the left-back area,
[2186.92 - 2190.92] P:1721.01 E:0.091632 |  but Patro gets there first and blasts it out of play for throwing to Arsenal
[2190.92 - 2192.92] P:1474.79 E:0.089993 |  near the halfway line.
[2192.92 - 2196.92] P:1618.34 E:0.092050 |  There is five live Champions League final score tonight, by the way,
[2196.92 - 2200.92] P:1611.80 E:0.086797 |  it's a great time to us, to the five live commentary alongside the final score graphics,
[2200.92 - 2203.92] P:1479.52 E:0.089404 |  that is on the BBC Sport website and app, it's on the red button,
[2203.92 - 2207.92] P:1598.60 E:0.095379 |  or you can look on the iPlayer as well, just click on five live final score,
[2207.92 - 2212.92] P:1571.16 E:0.092040 |  and the highlights are on BBC One Champions League match of the day later after the news,
[2212.92 - 2217.92] P:1541.66 E:0.090352 |  and if you haven't seen them yet, you really want to watch the highlights of last night,
[2217.92 - 2221.92] P:1568.55 E:0.090140 |  which was extraordinary, and they'll be available on the iPlayer as well
[2221.92 - 2226.92] P:1471.41 E:0.090294 |  from I think 10 o'clock onwards, but match of the day on BBC One tonight.
[2226.92 - 2229.92] P:1628.89 E:0.099910 |  So at the moment you'll be watching Fabian Ruiz's goal,
[2229.92 - 2234.92] P:1529.27 E:0.087113 |  one goal in the first leg for PSG, so far one in the second for the French Champions,
[2234.92 - 2239.92] P:1749.95 E:0.091704 |  but Marino heading to Rice, Rice has shot that clock, comes out to Audegarde,
[2239.92 - 2244.92] P:1895.95 E:0.093877 |  Audegarde then finds Martinelli, Martinelli who made a good start against Takimi,
[2244.92 - 2248.92] P:1930.37 E:0.088810 |  slips the ball past him, but there was defensive cover there from Truand-Nerbez,
[2248.92 - 2252.92] P:1760.24 E:0.098013 |  Martinelli does well, gets the ball in, then the shot on the edge of the area from Timber,
[2252.92 - 2256.92] P:1693.39 E:0.088901 |  that too blocked by Paris Saint-Germain on the edge of their own penalty area,
[2256.92 - 2261.92] P:1756.95 E:0.089426 |  and then the ball is lifted forward by Saliba, bounces on the left corner of the penalty area,
[2261.92 - 2264.92] P:1650.71 E:0.107701 |  with a high foot from Martinelli, but it's not given us a free kick,
[2264.92 - 2268.92] P:1743.28 E:0.090467 |  because Takimi brought the ball away and he's still going, so Arsenal have to get back,
[2268.92 - 2273.92] P:1684.88 E:0.090027 |  and then just blinks it past Louis Skelly, that was cool, Douay then with the pass,
[2273.92 - 2278.92] P:1619.95 E:0.080027 |  but he's over hit that, and Arsenal will have to clear through Saliba, which they do,
[2278.92 - 2284.92] P:1635.00 E:0.095648 |  but that's given away, headed forward, Truand-Nerbez is onto this, moving in field,
[2284.92 - 2289.92] P:1593.89 E:0.099424 |  25 yards out, he's got Kvaratskalia, I'd use him if I was him, Kvaratskalia then into the area,
[2289.92 - 2295.92] P:1683.35 E:0.095790 |  but Saliba comes across and is just able to, with his right foot, clear it away desperately.
[2295.92 - 2301.92] P:1592.67 E:0.106827 |  When he gets those jinky feet moving at players, it's very difficult to stop Kvaratskalia,
[2301.92 - 2305.92] P:1575.52 E:0.091534 |  nearly impossible, I'd say, just poked it through, they're trying to get the other side,
[2305.92 - 2308.92] P:1539.76 E:0.099561 |  but the big surprise with him, and I've seen it a lot tonight,
[2308.92 - 2313.92] P:1393.56 E:0.091642 |  he's made about two or three really important blocks in his own 18-yard box,
[2313.92 - 2318.92] P:1443.52 E:0.094569 |  he really does give protection to Nuno Mendes in the left-back position,
[2318.92 - 2320.92] P:1404.14 E:0.093576 |  and he works incredibly hard defensively.
[2320.92 - 2323.92] P:1657.76 E:0.093713 |  Truand-Nerbez has been dispossessed by Thomas Party,
[2323.92 - 2328.92] P:1648.57 E:0.100676 |  but then the pass is over here to PSG, they've got it back in their own half.
[2328.92 - 2333.92] P:1424.92 E:0.092406 |  At half-time, we will be crossing to Rome again,
[2333.92 - 2335.92] P:1550.70 E:0.092615 |  Russell Fuller is there, the tennis in Rome,
[2335.92 - 2338.92] P:1651.11 E:0.090280 |  we're not far away from Roland Garros here, are we?
[2338.92 - 2342.92] P:1783.88 E:0.094460 |  It's just a stone's throw away, Court Philippe Chatterier,
[2342.92 - 2346.92] P:1572.42 E:0.081749 |  which I've seen in the flesh, as it were, for the first time,
[2346.92 - 2351.92] P:1592.70 E:0.096458 |  since it was rebuilt, very impressive it is, as the ball is taken down by Douet,
[2351.92 - 2355.92] P:1444.40 E:0.089272 |  so we will be hearing from Jack Draper at half-time with Russell,
[2355.92 - 2357.92] P:1585.09 E:0.106312 |  I heard Russell say it was a little bit chilly in Rome,
[2357.92 - 2361.92] P:1611.50 E:0.091122 |  it's a lovely temperature here tonight, not warm at all.
[2361.92 - 2365.92] P:1548.50 E:0.086069 |  No, you could get better conditions for a football game,
[2365.92 - 2369.92] P:1501.34 E:0.101531 |  there's barely any breeze, it's a nice cool evening,
[2369.92 - 2371.92] P:1417.95 E:0.094032 |  slick pitch in a stadium like this,
[2371.92 - 2375.92] P:1396.24 E:0.094308 |  no better place to be playing or watching football at the moment.
[2375.92 - 2379.92] P:1502.62 E:0.101191 |  Not as cool as Bordeaux, though, according to Paul Robinson.
[2379.92 - 2381.92] P:1449.11 E:0.088024 |  Bordeaux sounded a bit nitty, didn't it?
[2381.92 - 2386.92] P:1522.01 E:0.096849 |  Bordeaux, so Alistair Bruce Ball will be getting there as well,
[2386.92 - 2389.92] P:1629.09 E:0.091301 |  if he's not there already, so that's what you'll be hearing
[2389.92 - 2392.92] P:1558.94 E:0.092937 |  on Five Life Tomorrow Night, and that should be a tremendous listen
[2392.92 - 2395.92] P:1501.14 E:0.096299 |  to hear the sounds of Norway as Tottenham go there
[2395.92 - 2397.92] P:1591.80 E:0.099339 |  and try to reach the Europa League final,
[2397.92 - 2400.92] P:1664.28 E:0.095670 |  whereas the Manchester United match will be live from Old Trafford
[2400.92 - 2404.92] P:1685.31 E:0.092607 |  on Sport Extra, so a great choice of listening for you tomorrow night,
[2404.92 - 2409.92] P:1703.52 E:0.095971 |  and obviously we'll be with Chelsea as well to see if they can claim their place,
[2409.92 - 2411.92] P:1654.60 E:0.090396 |  and they should in the conference final.
[2411.92 - 2415.92] P:1624.66 E:0.098498 |  But it's PSG going through to the Champions League final with this scoreline,
[2415.92 - 2419.92] P:1538.59 E:0.091886 |  one-nil, very enjoyable first half, Arsenal have been very, very good,
[2419.92 - 2422.92] P:1669.29 E:0.093236 |  but PSG, they couldn't find a way through,
[2422.92 - 2426.92] P:1528.79 E:0.090617 |  and Fabian Ruiz scored that goal just short of a half hour.
[2426.92 - 2430.92] P:1600.79 E:0.096704 |  Here is Vittinia, the little former Wolves midfielder,
[2430.92 - 2435.92] P:1455.79 E:0.088543 |  who certainly come on leaps and bands here at the Parc de France.
[2435.92 - 2438.92] P:1671.04 E:0.115693 |  That's given away by Hikini, but it's won back by Jo Arneves,
[2438.92 - 2442.92] P:1651.15 E:0.100124 |  he's into the area now, Douay, lots of Arsenal players back, a back heel,
[2442.92 - 2447.92] P:1642.66 E:0.084897 |  and Jo Arneves takes it away from PSG, and it's cleared away by Timber
[2447.92 - 2450.92] P:1669.89 E:0.104708 |  to the half-way line, and then forward from Patio,
[2450.92 - 2452.92] P:1746.86 E:0.102415 |  and out of play for an Arsenal throw.
[2452.92 - 2455.92] P:1637.03 E:0.097833 |  I'll tell you how quickly is Jo Arneves into the tackle, John.
[2455.92 - 2460.92] P:1537.52 E:0.098364 |  Wow, he is snapping about in that midfield, any little loose ball.
[2460.92 - 2464.92] P:1747.89 E:0.098331 |  If you don't protect that ball with your body well enough,
[2464.92 - 2468.92] P:1666.34 E:0.093441 |  he's got to be with his real low centre of gravity and quick feet,
[2468.92 - 2473.92] P:1532.86 E:0.094320 |  and that kind of stocky, quite strong build, but he's very light on his feet.
[2473.92 - 2476.92] P:1545.78 E:0.098973 |  He just gets after the ball, and he can get low,
[2476.92 - 2478.92] P:1494.65 E:0.094199 |  and in and around your ankles, around your hips,
[2478.92 - 2481.92] P:1327.97 E:0.087727 |  and he just gets a toe on the ball, and he scurries after it.
[2481.92 - 2484.92] P:1412.58 E:0.091597 |  He's such a good midfield player out of possession.
[2484.92 - 2487.92] P:1580.52 E:0.097277 |  Yes, the Portuguese, sturdy little figure, isn't he?
[2487.92 - 2491.92] P:1663.75 E:0.090348 |  20 years old, they bid 60 million euros,
[2491.92 - 2495.92] P:1906.36 E:0.094874 |  for him from Benfica, Paris Saint-Germain,
[2495.92 - 2498.92] P:1852.49 E:0.095198 |  that they are defending right now, Arsenal on the attack
[2498.92 - 2501.92] P:1829.94 E:0.095046 |  as the first half moves into the last five minutes,
[2501.92 - 2504.92] P:1856.95 E:0.091129 |  cross from the right-hand side, that's headed down and away by Patio,
[2504.92 - 2507.92] P:1758.56 E:0.097290 |  and then cleared further away towards the half-way line.
[2507.92 - 2512.92] P:1758.46 E:0.074784 |  Kivio, the Polish international central defender,
[2512.92 - 2516.92] P:1700.17 E:0.098975 |  his ball to the edge of the box, that's just cleared up in the air
[2516.92 - 2518.92] P:1677.37 E:0.078188 |  by Nuno Mendes, forward from Reis,
[2519.92 - 2522.92] P:1645.29 E:0.091843 |  but PSG have got that one away as well.
[2522.92 - 2526.92] P:1727.39 E:0.107329 |  Hakimi lost his footing, plays it in field though to Joao Neves
[2526.92 - 2530.92] P:1565.56 E:0.095061 |  and PSG have got it safely back near the edge of their own penalty area.
[2530.92 - 2533.92] P:1544.77 E:0.102048 |  They've got more of a measure of control now, PSG.
[2533.92 - 2536.92] P:1633.30 E:0.095933 |  Yes, and the atmosphere has changed in the ground, hasn't it?
[2536.92 - 2540.92] P:1657.24 E:0.082597 |  There's a calmness and a relaxed atmosphere now.
[2540.92 - 2543.92] P:1627.99 E:0.100495 |  It was a little bit edgy in that first 15 minutes.
[2544.92 - 2547.92] P:1554.15 E:0.077976 |  So, Arsenal, with the ball on the right,
[2547.92 - 2550.92] P:1743.13 E:0.098710 |  in comes the challenge from Douay this time.
[2550.92 - 2553.92] P:1768.14 E:0.091511 |  Douay back there, almost in his own left-back position.
[2553.92 - 2555.92] P:1438.00 E:0.109659 |  That's been a feature, hasn't it?
[2555.92 - 2557.92] P:1540.95 E:0.097638 |  Barcala, Douay, Kivarets, Kalea, as you've said,
[2557.92 - 2560.92] P:1509.73 E:0.098921 |  really helping out the back line, but here's Sakat now, lovely.
[2560.92 - 2562.92] P:1689.20 E:0.106708 |  Ball into the middle, Marino dies for it,
[2562.92 - 2564.92] P:1759.16 E:0.090399 |  but couldn't get any meaningful touch on that
[2564.92 - 2566.92] P:1737.41 E:0.081699 |  at the near post, edge of the six-yard box,
[2566.92 - 2569.92] P:1679.78 E:0.095533 |  and it was through him in a flash and beyond the ball kick.
[2569.92 - 2571.92] P:1436.01 E:0.099437 |  They need something, Arsenal,
[2571.92 - 2574.92] P:1530.56 E:0.099348 |  something like this to go in a toe from Marino into the far post,
[2574.92 - 2576.92] P:1598.36 E:0.100152 |  just anything to get them back in this game,
[2576.92 - 2578.92] P:1540.56 E:0.093000 |  because at the moment they're creating good situations
[2578.92 - 2581.92] P:1601.64 E:0.081967 |  without that real final product.
[2581.92 - 2586.92] P:1472.26 E:0.088909 |  Must win match tonight for Arsenal, otherwise they're out.
[2588.92 - 2593.92] P:1480.32 E:0.091980 |  These are the two clubs that have played the most matches
[2593.92 - 2597.92] P:1548.83 E:0.101659 |  in this competition without actually going on to win it.
[2598.92 - 2602.92] P:1500.37 E:0.103869 |  And only one French club has ever been European champions,
[2602.92 - 2604.92] P:1486.47 E:0.094317 |  winners of either the European Cup or the Champions League,
[2604.92 - 2607.92] P:1504.55 E:0.097310 |  and that's their big rivals, Marseille, Chris Waddle's old team,
[2607.92 - 2610.92] P:1578.57 E:0.086391 |  when they won it back in 1993.
[2610.92 - 2616.92] P:1664.36 E:0.087198 |  And as our friend in the Bistro, Ackill told us last night,
[2616.92 - 2620.92] P:1411.46 E:0.083934 |  Marseille won it in Munich.
[2620.92 - 2626.92] P:1348.94 E:0.089178 |  And this year's final is also in that great Barbarian city.
[2626.92 - 2628.92] P:1639.83 E:0.127915 |  Kavaric's Kalea turns on the half-way line,
[2628.92 - 2631.92] P:1651.50 E:0.107445 |  he was challenged by Timber, wanted a free kick for that.
[2631.92 - 2633.92] P:1722.08 E:0.096439 |  Referee's Vias not interested.
[2633.92 - 2635.92] P:1700.77 E:0.073755 |  He's got good football knowledge.
[2635.92 - 2636.92] P:1629.08 E:0.082382 |  Our friend Ackill, isn't he?
[2636.92 - 2638.92] P:1596.01 E:0.089287 |  It's incredible football knowledge.
[2638.92 - 2642.92] P:1516.43 E:0.090736 |  Unbelievable what he did about English football and European football.
[2642.92 - 2645.92] P:1464.80 E:0.104402 |  Yes, and he was a little edgy about this,
[2645.92 - 2648.92] P:1521.74 E:0.097060 |  but I think confident he's already made his plans for Munich,
[2648.92 - 2653.92] P:1446.25 E:0.088199 |  as Raya, long, long pass downfield from him,
[2653.92 - 2654.92] P:1702.08 E:0.078983 |  Sacher on the chase.
[2654.92 - 2655.92] P:1787.36 E:0.088607 |  No-no-menders is with him.
[2655.92 - 2657.92] P:1748.42 E:0.110482 |  They're into the penalty area now on the right-hand side.
[2657.92 - 2660.92] P:1811.01 E:0.093657 |  Gets the ball across, cleared away by Marquinhos, though.
[2660.92 - 2663.92] P:1660.93 E:0.101286 |  There were two men in there, Reiss and Martin Ali,
[2663.92 - 2667.92] P:1629.19 E:0.089203 |  but Marquinhos was able to find himself in the right place.
[2667.92 - 2670.92] P:1640.50 E:0.111540 |  Then Hakini with a long pass, Barcala taking on Louis Skelly,
[2670.92 - 2672.92] P:1657.73 E:0.096553 |  down the right wing, is able to get the ball down,
[2672.92 - 2675.92] P:1552.20 E:0.103461 |  plays it across, Douay on the edge of the area, the teenager,
[2675.92 - 2678.92] P:1740.18 E:0.104153 |  beats Kivill, right foot shot into the body of Louis Skelly,
[2678.92 - 2679.92] P:1603.76 E:0.109137 |  who's gone down.
[2679.92 - 2680.92] P:1701.58 E:0.106237 |  Might have hit him in the face, actually.
[2680.92 - 2682.92] P:1699.16 E:0.119201 |  And therefore the referee stopped playing,
[2682.92 - 2687.92] P:1855.66 E:0.110941 |  much to the frustration of the PSG supporters.
[2689.92 - 2692.92] P:1838.47 E:0.098715 |  So Louis Skelly stays down, and at that moment,
[2692.92 - 2696.92] P:1725.08 E:0.095321 |  Anottas Nikola Teterin and Luis Enrique both almost in unison there,
[2696.92 - 2700.92] P:1706.11 E:0.086127 |  turned around, walked back, picked up a water bottle,
[2700.92 - 2702.92] P:1582.75 E:0.088021 |  and returned to their coaches on the bench.
[2702.92 - 2705.92] P:1630.80 E:0.093192 |  Yeah, breaking play where they can just take their eyes off this game.
[2705.92 - 2706.92] P:1656.84 E:0.099433 |  I mean, it is intense.
[2706.92 - 2711.92] P:1698.74 E:0.098713 |  There's little jewels and little moments on the pitch all the time,
[2711.92 - 2715.92] P:1736.10 E:0.080612 |  and this one, when he's a fair old hit from Douay,
[2715.92 - 2718.92] P:1751.34 E:0.086427 |  and it does catch Louis Skelly, he gets side on,
[2718.92 - 2721.92] P:1591.77 E:0.079810 |  and the ball strikes him right just underneath the ribs.
[2721.92 - 2724.92] P:1481.41 E:0.071925 |  Really took the wind out of his sails.
[2725.92 - 2726.92] P:1716.08 E:0.105086 |  Yeah, so it's going to be a drop ball,
[2726.92 - 2729.92] P:1758.85 E:0.093613 |  the referee just goes across to Douay to explain what he's going to do.
[2729.92 - 2731.92] P:1579.35 E:0.090595 |  I mean, I know it's not a head injury,
[2731.92 - 2734.92] P:1671.33 E:0.084158 |  but I think the referee's right to, you know,
[2734.92 - 2735.92] P:1665.98 E:0.085539 |  probably stop the game.
[2735.92 - 2738.92] P:1593.17 E:0.095042 |  A lot of people would argue and say he should have played on, but...
[2740.92 - 2745.92] P:1482.96 E:0.080344 |  So he's dropped the ball, and now he's asked to get it back.
[2745.92 - 2746.92] P:1640.94 E:0.093437 |  I'm not sure what happened there.
[2746.92 - 2751.92] P:1481.32 E:0.082134 |  Anyway, he's dropped the ball, and Douay unchallenged,
[2751.92 - 2753.92] P:1515.63 E:0.099450 |  so it's an uncontested drop ball, really,
[2753.92 - 2755.92] P:1553.64 E:0.090150 |  and Douay plays it back to Hakimi.
[2755.92 - 2758.92] P:1677.48 E:0.087921 |  Half-time approaching, run the last minute of the first 45.
[2758.92 - 2760.92] P:1478.18 E:0.087696 |  Paris-Saint-Germain won Arsenal, no, two minutes.
[2760.92 - 2762.92] P:1475.88 E:0.091922 |  I didn't show up in two minutes.
[2762.92 - 2765.92] P:1574.70 E:0.091257 |  There we are. You'll have heard that.
[2765.92 - 2766.92] P:1858.61 E:0.077766 |  Two minutes.
[2766.92 - 2768.92] P:1636.04 E:0.082677 |  Look, two minutes.
[2768.92 - 2772.92] P:1383.66 E:0.101407 |  Ball's out of play for a throw to PSG over there on the far side,
[2772.92 - 2774.92] P:1220.06 E:0.087070 |  halfway inside their own half.
[2774.92 - 2777.92] P:1423.07 E:0.096176 |  I mentioned that we are a stones throw away from Roland Garros,
[2777.92 - 2779.92] P:1395.34 E:0.094957 |  stones throw away from the Sain as well,
[2779.92 - 2781.92] P:1072.69 E:0.096093 |  not far from the Bois de Boulogne.
[2781.92 - 2784.92] P:1539.53 E:0.090734 |  Julian Laurent before the match, what is that in French?
[2784.92 - 2786.92] P:1630.84 E:0.097292 |  How would you say a stones throw?
[2786.92 - 2789.92] P:1660.98 E:0.096943 |  And it is Aquelques & Cableux.
[2790.92 - 2792.92] P:1622.14 E:0.089074 |  A stones throw.
[2792.92 - 2794.92] P:1670.15 E:0.089140 |  I thought that was going to come out differently then,
[2794.92 - 2795.92] P:1393.98 E:0.114713 |  for a moment.
[2795.92 - 2797.92] P:1491.25 E:0.103675 |  Raya is able to get the ball downfield,
[2797.92 - 2801.92] P:1845.63 E:0.093409 |  and Rice strides on, gives it to Odegaard.
[2801.92 - 2803.92] P:1923.44 E:0.087988 |  Now he has Saka in added time.
[2803.92 - 2808.92] P:1822.78 E:0.096343 |  Saka's ball across, but Hakimi is able to position himself perfectly.
[2808.92 - 2810.92] P:1716.71 E:0.082502 |  Martinelli behind him,
[2810.92 - 2813.92] P:1663.36 E:0.105468 |  and left-footed, he clears it out of play on the far side,
[2813.92 - 2815.92] P:1817.35 E:0.099688 |  and Martinelli, frustration there,
[2815.92 - 2818.92] P:1918.16 E:0.085871 |  just followed on through and kicked the post.
[2818.92 - 2820.92] P:1591.50 E:0.099264 |  He's got to get across the face of him.
[2820.92 - 2823.92] P:1893.91 E:0.097972 |  Arsenal are going to run out of opportunities
[2823.92 - 2825.92] P:1921.13 E:0.092601 |  to make these situations count.
[2825.92 - 2827.92] P:1909.85 E:0.093003 |  He's a good position from Hakimi,
[2827.92 - 2829.92] P:1927.89 E:0.093895 |  he touched right in where he should be,
[2829.92 - 2831.92] P:1961.67 E:0.093576 |  but Martinelli has to make that happen.
[2831.92 - 2833.92] P:1799.41 E:0.100958 |  Back to the long throws from Arsenal,
[2833.92 - 2835.92] P:1843.91 E:0.110850 |  Partier comes off the head of Catini,
[2835.92 - 2837.92] P:1767.13 E:0.095415 |  but up in the air it went,
[2837.92 - 2839.92] P:1775.86 E:0.101066 |  and then Donnarumma arrives,
[2839.92 - 2842.92] P:1764.91 E:0.083077 |  throwing himself headlong to catch the ball,
[2842.92 - 2844.92] P:1767.43 E:0.101430 |  like a green flash he was,
[2844.92 - 2847.92] P:1628.21 E:0.084076 |  and he's got it safely in his hands.
[2847.92 - 2849.92] P:1715.34 E:0.103441 |  And that's been the story of the first half, really.
[2849.92 - 2851.92] P:1735.68 E:0.092915 |  Arsenal have been good.
[2851.92 - 2852.92] P:1772.63 E:0.071995 |  Yeah.
[2852.92 - 2853.92] P:1658.14 E:0.067328 |  But...
[2853.92 - 2855.92] P:1645.95 E:0.091254 |  Not quite good enough.
[2855.92 - 2858.92] P:1625.12 E:0.089657 |  Not quite good enough to just make those chances count.
[2858.92 - 2862.92] P:1543.44 E:0.091860 |  And a little bit of that is PSG, i.e. Donnarumma,
[2862.92 - 2865.92] P:1580.94 E:0.083711 |  has really made two excellent saves.
[2865.92 - 2868.92] P:1364.87 E:0.088706 |  So that could have been very different in that first ten minutes,
[2868.92 - 2871.92] P:1416.27 E:0.091824 |  if he doesn't get down to make that save from Odegaard.
[2871.92 - 2873.92] P:1651.90 E:0.114585 |  The pitch is completely different.
[2873.92 - 2876.92] P:1530.96 E:0.078966 |  But Scalia has fouled Saliba,
[2876.92 - 2878.92] P:1550.67 E:0.107298 |  so that's a free kick to Arsenal,
[2878.92 - 2880.92] P:1700.93 E:0.089478 |  near the right corner of the box.
[2880.92 - 2883.92] P:1772.99 E:0.107704 |  Well, coming here tonight, we knew that either Arsenal or PSG,
[2883.92 - 2885.92] P:1725.96 E:0.118401 |  by the end of the evening would be appearing in
[2885.92 - 2888.92] P:1806.96 E:0.095508 |  a second Champions League final,
[2888.92 - 2891.92] P:1772.52 E:0.112546 |  and as the halftime whistle goes with this scoreline,
[2891.92 - 2893.92] P:1751.23 E:0.104135 |  it is going to be Paris Saint-Germain,
[2893.92 - 2896.92] P:1679.56 E:0.107333 |  leading through that Fabian Ruiz goal,
[2896.92 - 2899.92] P:1832.58 E:0.099559 |  that well-struck goal from the edge of the area,
[2899.92 - 2901.92] P:1644.70 E:0.085873 |  following the free kick,
[2901.92 - 2904.92] P:1710.59 E:0.083574 |  and then the final thinking of the chances that they've had.
[2904.92 - 2906.92] P:1703.78 E:0.089188 |  Nicola Teta, Declan Rice yesterday,
[2906.92 - 2910.92] P:1924.62 E:0.095225 |  saying that they needed magical moments and so close,
[2910.92 - 2912.92] P:1806.52 E:0.096092 |  particularly really the chance for Martinelli,
[2912.92 - 2915.92] P:1822.98 E:0.086778 |  Odegaard as well, with that fiercely struck shot,
[2915.92 - 2918.92] P:1709.21 E:0.085792 |  but Donnarumma making the saves as he did at the Emirates.
[2918.92 - 2920.92] P:1868.03 E:0.091519 |  Yeah, they've laid the foundation,
[2920.92 - 2924.92] P:1659.73 E:0.074528 |  has had the substance to the performance, has been excellent.
[2924.92 - 2927.92] P:1620.45 E:0.080385 |  They've asked a question, I think they've been aggressive,
[2927.92 - 2929.92] P:1782.34 E:0.086083 |  they've taken the game to PSG,
[2929.92 - 2931.92] P:1590.94 E:0.079915 |  they've unsettled them in the opening 15 minutes,
[2931.92 - 2935.92] P:1707.37 E:0.077419 |  but what he said in the press conference about the magical moments,
[2935.92 - 2938.92] P:1812.66 E:0.061306 |  they've been on the other side,
[2938.92 - 2941.92] P:1883.47 E:0.076323 |  they've produced those, the goalkeepers produced the moment,
[2941.92 - 2944.92] P:1902.83 E:0.093453 |  Fabian Ruiz has produced an outstanding finish,
[2944.92 - 2946.92] P:1831.13 E:0.080057 |  so that's why they're behind,
[2946.92 - 2948.92] P:1886.37 E:0.077032 |  and that I guess is what this competition is all about,
[2948.92 - 2951.92] P:1897.34 E:0.090570 |  the quality of player that can do things like they've done,
[2951.92 - 2954.92] P:1908.76 E:0.076366 |  and Arsenal just haven't put the finishing touches to that.
[2954.92 - 2956.92] P:1909.33 E:0.093918 |  Yeah, so halftime here,
[2956.92 - 2958.92] P:2018.39 E:0.074957 |  suddenly it feels like the atmosphere,
[2958.92 - 2961.92] P:1855.58 E:0.084863 |  that's been bubbling throughout the course of the first half,
[2961.92 - 2963.92] P:1896.19 E:0.071252 |  it's just lulled a little,
[2963.92 - 2966.92] P:1681.85 E:0.096733 |  and 1-0 at halftime, Paris and Jermaine won,
[2966.92 - 2969.92] P:1786.90 E:0.071435 |  Arsenal 0-2-0 on aggregate.
[2969.92 - 2973.92] P:1755.72 E:0.074689 |  It is compelling, is this Champions League,
[2973.92 - 2975.92] P:1908.86 E:0.079081 |  75 and all second leg,
[2975.92 - 2978.92] P:1735.03 E:0.081550 |  and that, with half an hour gone,
[2978.92 - 2981.92] P:1824.57 E:0.090080 |  Arsenal could have been 2-0 up or 3-0 down.
[2981.92 - 2984.92] P:1827.68 E:0.083515 |  Yeah, you're right, they really could,
[2984.92 - 2989.92] P:1612.27 E:0.083572 |  and for Paris to be as devastating and as cutting as what they were,
[2989.92 - 2992.92] P:1655.11 E:0.082678 |  not having the ballchappers, they just didn't have it,
[2992.92 - 2994.92] P:1690.20 E:0.085397 |  but they didn't seem to mind,
[2994.92 - 2996.92] P:1700.08 E:0.084354 |  they've got a goalkeeper that's pulling out saves
[2996.92 - 2998.92] P:1898.46 E:0.091018 |  like the one he did for Martin Odegaard's shot,
[2998.92 - 3000.92] P:1808.43 E:0.084903 |  I think the wide players have defended well,
[3000.92 - 3003.92] P:1823.21 E:0.096206 |  they're punching their weight okay in terms of dealing with the throw-ins,
[3003.92 - 3005.92] P:1825.51 E:0.064804 |  and it just hasn't dropped for Arsenal,
[3005.92 - 3007.92] P:1748.66 E:0.082107 |  but then to go and do what they did,
[3007.92 - 3009.92] P:1777.43 E:0.077900 |  and look so dangerous,
[3009.92 - 3013.92] P:1638.11 E:0.073536 |  I mean it's a tough one for Arsenal to crack, isn't it,
[3013.92 - 3015.92] P:1850.26 E:0.090032 |  because the more ball and the more control you have,
[3015.92 - 3018.92] P:1627.82 E:0.070903 |  sometimes you're even more vulnerable at that point.
[3018.92 - 3022.92] P:1684.72 E:0.092670 |  I mean that is one of the great saves, isn't it?
[3022.92 - 3023.92] P:1577.10 E:0.087527 |  I think so.
[3023.92 - 3025.92] P:1749.40 E:0.083278 |  One of the reasons I say that is,
[3025.92 - 3029.92] P:1663.19 E:0.087365 |  I've done enough with Joe Hart this season for him to tell me about
[3029.92 - 3031.92] P:1824.20 E:0.083576 |  wherever the shot is from,
[3031.92 - 3034.92] P:1644.84 E:0.082876 |  you then have to look from where a goalkeeper actually sees it from,
[3034.92 - 3039.92] P:1787.90 E:0.090917 |  and he probably had 7 yards maybe to react to a shot
[3039.92 - 3042.92] P:1684.83 E:0.080626 |  that was absolutely thumped.
[3042.92 - 3045.92] P:1780.08 E:0.073481 |  It wasn't curled or anything, it was thumped.
[3045.92 - 3049.92] P:1897.23 E:0.085417 |  That could have been as fiercely hit a shot as I've seen all season.
[3049.92 - 3051.92] P:1760.64 E:0.067486 |  It was travelling.
[3051.92 - 3053.92] P:1677.80 E:0.100209 |  And it was along the turf as well,
[3053.92 - 3055.92] P:1859.25 E:0.081193 |  so it wasn't even one of those that had a little bit of height to it,
[3055.92 - 3057.92] P:1861.83 E:0.096383 |  it was going right along the ground,
[3057.92 - 3059.92] P:1910.16 E:0.079504 |  and it was through all of those bodies,
[3059.92 - 3063.92] P:1721.06 E:0.085275 |  and it was interesting that we had that detailed chat with Robo,
[3063.92 - 3067.92] P:1807.15 E:0.088958 |  wasn't it before the game about these situations and the reaction time,
[3067.92 - 3070.92] P:1828.15 E:0.088925 |  and he was quite close to his line, wasn't he?
[3070.92 - 3072.92] P:1770.04 E:0.087920 |  He had come out a couple of yards,
[3072.92 - 3074.92] P:1791.09 E:0.076004 |  which maybe, as Robo explained,
[3074.92 - 3077.92] P:1885.15 E:0.070761 |  gave him the time to actually get down,
[3077.92 - 3081.92] P:1650.79 E:0.079342 |  because to be that big and then get down to your ankles in that low
[3081.92 - 3083.92] P:1734.54 E:0.087765 |  to react like that, it's not easy.
[3083.92 - 3086.92] P:1698.65 E:0.093817 |  So he gives himself the reaction time in order to do it,
[3086.92 - 3088.92] P:1775.55 E:0.095092 |  and what a fabulous save,
[3088.92 - 3090.92] P:1730.88 E:0.097350 |  and what a contribution he's made to this game.
[3090.92 - 3093.92] P:1735.52 E:0.094816 |  And tactically, really, until the goal,
[3093.92 - 3095.92] P:1840.47 E:0.085077 |  Arsenal were absolutely spot on, weren't they?
[3095.92 - 3099.92] P:1841.07 E:0.103721 |  Timber was high, Lewis Skelly was inverted,
[3099.92 - 3102.92] P:1874.13 E:0.086198 |  Erdogan was playing off Marino
[3102.92 - 3105.92] P:1750.62 E:0.100322 |  and would also then drop for any corner or long throw
[3105.92 - 3107.92] P:1852.84 E:0.077482 |  to pick it up on the edge of the box.
[3107.92 - 3111.92] P:1746.58 E:0.084180 |  I mean, they had Paris Saint-Germain for that first 25 minutes.
[3111.92 - 3114.92] P:1755.49 E:0.075812 |  Yeah, they needed the goal, Chappers, didn't they?
[3114.92 - 3116.92] P:1873.70 E:0.096183 |  You know, if you're going to start that well here,
[3116.92 - 3119.92] P:1918.64 E:0.083542 |  you need one of those throw-ins to drop,
[3119.92 - 3123.92] P:1794.25 E:0.084277 |  and somebody hook one in, or for Donorama not to produce
[3123.92 - 3125.92] P:1808.70 E:0.088948 |  such a brilliant piece of goalkeeping,
[3125.92 - 3128.92] P:1698.50 E:0.085723 |  they needed something in that period to go their way.
[3128.92 - 3132.92] P:1756.02 E:0.082300 |  And when it didn't, and then you saw the break of PSG
[3132.92 - 3135.92] P:1907.07 E:0.088094 |  and Kavaris-Kalia just scares me to death
[3135.92 - 3138.92] P:1673.42 E:0.085828 |  when I see him just touching that ball,
[3138.92 - 3140.92] P:1800.91 E:0.089975 |  arriving in that corner of the 18-yard box.
[3140.92 - 3143.92] P:1969.01 E:0.068157 |  If you're a fullback, you are just, your head's thinking,
[3143.92 - 3145.92] P:1534.28 E:0.065871 |  what do I do here?
[3145.92 - 3148.92] P:1685.97 E:0.091470 |  He can go outside, inside, he runs at you, he goes through you,
[3148.92 - 3151.92] P:1713.37 E:0.084563 |  whatever it may be, and he does it with such speed.
[3151.92 - 3153.92] P:1514.40 E:0.081981 |  It's just a joy to watch.
[3153.92 - 3156.92] P:1884.28 E:0.075152 |  Maybe, John, the only shot that's been hit harder
[3156.92 - 3159.92] P:1684.94 E:0.083447 |  was the actual Paris Saint-Germain goal.
[3159.92 - 3162.92] P:1638.39 E:0.088500 |  Oh, well, I know, I think Audigards was, I think it was,
[3162.92 - 3165.92] P:1732.78 E:0.096881 |  I mean, it was very well hit, but I'm saying Audigards.
[3165.92 - 3167.92] P:1704.67 E:0.099667 |  Honestly, it was a blur.
[3167.92 - 3170.92] P:1677.87 E:0.093812 |  Yeah, I mean, Arsenal weren't great with the defending
[3170.92 - 3172.92] P:1665.56 E:0.080751 |  on that set piece, though, Chappers.
[3172.92 - 3174.92] P:1727.68 E:0.081391 |  I think they let himself down with that.
[3174.92 - 3176.92] P:1441.08 E:0.088384 |  Martinelli's got to put the brakes on, party heads it right back
[3176.92 - 3178.92] P:1678.38 E:0.095163 |  into that danger area.
[3178.92 - 3181.92] P:1794.27 E:0.085657 |  Those little fine details were just out,
[3181.92 - 3183.92] P:1457.25 E:0.073359 |  and that's where they paid the price.
[3183.92 - 3186.92] P:1847.94 E:0.100925 |  Aigilia Noura, who is alongside John and Matt as well,
[3186.92 - 3189.92] P:1744.59 E:0.081431 |  and yet, for everything that we've just discussed about
[3189.92 - 3192.92] P:1803.27 E:0.085066 |  where Arsenal had the advantage,
[3192.92 - 3196.92] P:1735.26 E:0.080013 |  Paris Saint-Germain should really be home and dry now, shouldn't they?
[3196.92 - 3198.92] P:1296.16 E:0.081790 |  Yeah, I think so, apart from the goal,
[3198.92 - 3201.92] P:1608.22 E:0.102629 |  there's those two counterattacks really that they didn't play well,
[3201.92 - 3205.92] P:1555.10 E:0.097204 |  the one for Douay on the Barcola interception, really,
[3205.92 - 3208.92] P:1700.22 E:0.091141 |  and then the one for Barcola, like Vasquez,
[3208.92 - 3211.92] P:1816.57 E:0.097110 |  gives him, well, PSG is just so good, Fabian Riz, again,
[3211.92 - 3213.92] P:1959.15 E:0.077193 |  in one touch, puts him through,
[3213.92 - 3216.92] P:1816.87 E:0.088958 |  but then when you've suffered so much for the first half hour
[3216.92 - 3219.92] P:1915.15 E:0.094918 |  of your PSG, you're also lucky that you haven't considered, really,
[3219.92 - 3223.92] P:1757.18 E:0.086449 |  because they've been rattled, like, I've rarely seen them this season
[3223.92 - 3226.92] P:1891.00 E:0.090560 |  being so on the back foot and so on the pressure,
[3226.92 - 3228.92] P:1870.53 E:0.075693 |  like, Arsenal put them in the first half an hour,
[3228.92 - 3231.92] P:1848.18 E:0.090261 |  but it's what we said pretty much for Arsenal to qualify for the final,
[3231.92 - 3233.92] P:1710.38 E:0.084689 |  they would have to be perfect,
[3233.92 - 3237.92] P:1782.19 E:0.089454 |  and they might have lost this tie on the first 15 minutes of the two legs
[3237.92 - 3239.92] P:1799.50 E:0.083729 |  at home in the first leg, and tonight here,
[3239.92 - 3242.92] P:1820.16 E:0.088398 |  because they could have been two nil after 10 minutes,
[3242.92 - 3244.92] P:1735.50 E:0.058472 |  and the game would have been completely different.
[3244.92 - 3246.92] P:1985.58 E:0.070909 |  So you're still nervous?
[3246.92 - 3248.92] P:1852.30 E:0.056486 |  So no, I didn't sit down.
[3248.92 - 3250.92] P:1689.65 E:0.094127 |  That's where I was sad.
[3250.92 - 3253.92] P:1870.33 E:0.080974 |  I could not sit, I was standing up the whole first 45 minutes,
[3253.92 - 3256.92] P:1984.27 E:0.079144 |  it's just, because we knew it was going to be a great game,
[3256.92 - 3258.92] P:1786.92 E:0.097075 |  very different to yesterday, of course,
[3258.92 - 3260.92] P:1874.24 E:0.082939 |  because those teams have different qualities and flows
[3260.92 - 3262.92] P:1789.57 E:0.077935 |  than Barcelona and Inter Milan,
[3262.92 - 3266.92] P:1890.06 E:0.083237 |  but tactically, I think for Arsenal to have the perfect game plan,
[3266.92 - 3270.92] P:1921.34 E:0.077116 |  for Arsenal to be so good and do so many good things,
[3270.92 - 3273.92] P:1735.95 E:0.096261 |  and yet to be two nil down on aggregate,
[3273.92 - 3275.92] P:1882.09 E:0.063740 |  this is what football is about, though,
[3275.92 - 3277.92] P:1680.12 E:0.095319 |  you might be the best team,
[3277.92 - 3279.92] P:1816.51 E:0.090074 |  and yet somehow find yourself in the losing side.
[3279.92 - 3282.92] P:1792.33 E:0.070501 |  Have you been like a cat on a hot tin roof?
[3282.92 - 3284.92] P:1766.66 E:0.099472 |  It was more of a...
[3284.92 - 3286.92] P:1769.84 E:0.091803 |  What's that in French?
[3286.92 - 3288.92] P:1957.43 E:0.089558 |  Chasse sur le toit?
[3288.92 - 3289.92] P:1816.32 E:0.052245 |  Yeah.
[3289.92 - 3291.92] P:1890.80 E:0.099736 |  But I've been more like a statue, John,
[3291.92 - 3295.92] P:1864.55 E:0.082798 |  I promise you, I could hardly move, it was inferno.
[3295.92 - 3298.92] P:1780.31 E:0.081540 |  I mean, you really mangled stones' throat, didn't you?
[3298.92 - 3299.92] P:1780.54 E:0.092028 |  Let's be honest.
[3299.92 - 3300.92] P:1734.37 E:0.102354 |  Second half.
[3300.92 - 3301.92] P:1899.65 E:0.091639 |  Butchers.
[3301.92 - 3302.92] P:1711.02 E:0.100794 |  Are you rude?
[3302.92 - 3305.92] P:1863.51 E:0.100283 |  See, I should have heard it, Jules, it was perfect.
[3305.92 - 3310.92] P:1822.74 E:0.095484 |  Second half on the way, brilliant first 45 minutes,
[3310.92 - 3312.92] P:1798.39 E:0.091989 |  Arsenal are not out of it,
[3312.92 - 3314.92] P:1797.05 E:0.091097 |  but they're one nil down on the night,
[3314.92 - 3317.92] P:1755.55 E:0.081877 |  and they are two nil down on aggregate.

[3427.92 - 3428.92] P:1793.46 E:0.097208 |  My first call.
[3428.92 - 3431.92] P:1542.00 E:0.118759 |  It was a wire-rich, rental clear. How much was yours?
[3431.92 - 3432.92] P:1930.89 E:0.109899 |  13,000.
[3432.92 - 3434.92] P:1687.39 E:0.116176 |  13,000?

[3461.92 - 3463.92] P:1916.99 E:0.056261 |  Correspondent Russell Fuller is there.
[3463.92 - 3466.92] P:1886.99 E:0.097055 |  What's to doubt for you on the first round so far?
[3467.92 - 3470.92] P:1660.66 E:0.093951 |  We are still going fairly late in the night,
[3470.92 - 3472.92] P:1875.24 E:0.101387 |  and it's a chilly night, too, in Rome.
[3472.92 - 3476.92] P:1811.39 E:0.096476 |  Mark with Emma Raddickanu now about to begin a deciding set
[3476.92 - 3480.92] P:1695.96 E:0.088412 |  against Maya Joint, the 19-year-old Australian qualifier.
[3480.92 - 3483.92] P:1580.06 E:0.089356 |  Raddickanu won the first set by seven games to five,
[3483.92 - 3485.92] P:1919.64 E:0.081848 |  and really should have won the second as well.
[3485.92 - 3486.92] P:2243.20 E:0.087077 |  She served for the match.
[3486.92 - 3489.92] P:1910.40 E:0.078024 |  She was twice the break-up, but she's just lost a tie break
[3489.92 - 3493.92] P:1773.87 E:0.067902 |  by seven points to one, so a third set coming shortly.
[3493.92 - 3496.92] P:1920.27 E:0.085517 |  On this court earlier, Cameron Norrie had a win
[3496.92 - 3499.92] P:1672.16 E:0.083124 |  as a lucky loser, having lost in qualifying yesterday.
[3499.92 - 3501.92] P:1787.23 E:0.076840 |  He beat Chris O'Connell in straight sets.
[3501.92 - 3504.92] P:1537.67 E:0.081787 |  He'll take on Daniel Medvedev in the second round on Friday.
[3504.92 - 3507.92] P:1856.67 E:0.078156 |  But the British number one, Katie Bolter, went out in straight sets
[3507.92 - 3511.92] P:1661.16 E:0.077179 |  to a former French Open runner-up in Anastasia Pavliuchenkova.
[3511.92 - 3515.92] P:1836.97 E:0.081518 |  And then a lot of British eyes, certainly, on Jack Draper,
[3515.92 - 3519.92] P:1879.86 E:0.086458 |  who will arrive in Rome, Russell, in the top five in the world.
[3521.92 - 3525.92] P:1722.96 E:0.087769 |  Yes, and second in the annual race, the rankings that are calculated
[3525.92 - 3526.92] P:2000.18 E:0.084864 |  from the start of the year.
[3526.92 - 3530.92] P:1715.33 E:0.080522 |  And remember that the top eight qualify for the ATP final.
[3530.92 - 3533.92] P:1760.52 E:0.080917 |  So that's very much a goal for Jack Draper,
[3533.92 - 3537.92] P:1799.93 E:0.080933 |  who has been the special one on the men's side for a few years now,
[3537.92 - 3538.92] P:1552.32 E:0.086040 |  for many years now.
[3538.92 - 3541.92] P:1374.41 E:0.084321 |  But of course, no one quite knows whether that talent is going
[3541.92 - 3543.92] P:1373.56 E:0.072944 |  to develop in a way it would be hoped.
[3543.92 - 3546.92] P:1482.58 E:0.070855 |  I think the fact that he had a late growth spurt
[3546.92 - 3548.92] P:1821.36 E:0.080198 |  turned him into a six-foot-four man help.
[3548.92 - 3551.92] P:1531.54 E:0.078652 |  The fact that he's a left-hander helps too.
[3551.92 - 3554.92] P:1639.02 E:0.065101 |  Naturally, a right-hander, in fact, but he just picked up a racket
[3554.92 - 3557.92] P:1583.96 E:0.069760 |  with his left hand when he was hitting against a wall
[3557.92 - 3560.92] P:1699.76 E:0.082778 |  when he was younger and continued playing in that way.
[3560.92 - 3562.92] P:1407.82 E:0.075862 |  So that's certainly another little advantage.
[3562.92 - 3564.92] P:1678.70 E:0.086401 |  And three titles in the past year,
[3564.92 - 3567.92] P:1608.00 E:0.081179 |  and then nearly a fourth having just missed out
[3567.92 - 3569.92] P:1653.59 E:0.070770 |  on the Madrid Open title last weekend.
[3570.92 - 3574.92] P:1701.04 E:0.074884 |  Well, let's hear from him on how he's feeling after that defeat
[3574.92 - 3576.92] P:1828.13 E:0.071822 |  to Casparud in the Madrid final.
[3576.92 - 3580.92] P:1497.97 E:0.070220 |  Hurt and gutted with the final and the way it kind of went in the end.
[3580.92 - 3584.92] P:1183.12 E:0.081923 |  I think overall, I'm very proud of the couple of weeks I had there.
[3584.92 - 3586.92] P:1184.54 E:0.095248 |  I played some really good tennis.
[3586.92 - 3590.92] P:1459.76 E:0.082971 |  After Monte Carlo, I was hoping for a bit of a clay breakthrough
[3590.92 - 3592.92] P:1359.68 E:0.091446 |  because I know what I'm bringing in practice.
[3592.92 - 3594.92] P:1256.23 E:0.103572 |  But in there, yeah, I really struggled.
[3594.92 - 3597.92] P:1161.81 E:0.088436 |  And so going into Madrid, I was a bit apprehensive.
[3598.92 - 3600.92] P:1344.19 E:0.075553 |  But then trust in my training, did all the right things
[3600.92 - 3602.92] P:947.00 E:0.087889 |  and had a really good week
[3602.92 - 3605.92] P:1176.94 E:0.075315 |  and showed some really good tennis on the top.
[3605.92 - 3607.92] P:1325.53 E:0.099298 |  What does it mean to be top five in the world?
[3607.92 - 3610.92] P:1688.24 E:0.086624 |  Do you feel mentally as if you're a top five player now?
[3610.92 - 3613.92] P:1563.53 E:0.095309 |  Yeah, I think, I mean, I don't think about it in all honesty,
[3613.92 - 3615.92] P:1190.56 E:0.085543 |  but I think I'm coming to terms with the fact
[3615.92 - 3617.92] P:1280.25 E:0.067688 |  that I'm playing some good consistent tennis
[3617.92 - 3620.92] P:1164.69 E:0.092618 |  and that's a reflection on my ranking.
[3620.92 - 3623.92] P:1023.33 E:0.093178 |  And I guess all the hard work that I've done over the past few years,
[3623.92 - 3626.92] P:1470.03 E:0.084144 |  all the little moments, little decisions, setbacks
[3626.92 - 3631.92] P:1079.22 E:0.081800 |  and I've really grown up a lot in terms of, I think, all areas,
[3631.92 - 3633.92] P:1246.83 E:0.089731 |  but I've got a lot to keep on going for.
[3633.92 - 3636.92] P:1316.28 E:0.078994 |  So I feel good, but at the same time, I want to keep on going.
[3636.92 - 3638.92] P:1381.12 E:0.066839 |  And Madrid is a tournament, I think,
[3638.92 - 3640.92] P:1567.48 E:0.083415 |  which would particularly suit you
[3640.92 - 3642.92] P:1488.40 E:0.101681 |  given the quicker conditions and the altitude.
[3642.92 - 3645.92] P:1557.72 E:0.073997 |  Do you think that your game can have the same impact
[3645.92 - 3647.92] P:1134.29 E:0.091729 |  on the clay courts of Roman Roland Garros?
[3647.92 - 3650.92] P:1268.70 E:0.093325 |  You know, I'm confident that I'm playing some really good tennis
[3650.92 - 3653.92] P:1460.79 E:0.078531 |  on any surface, any conditions.
[3653.92 - 3656.92] P:1155.93 E:0.086667 |  And I think that, you know, if I do all the right things,
[3656.92 - 3659.92] P:1311.98 E:0.073008 |  I'm going to be a tough guy to beat, so let's see how it goes.
[3659.92 - 3662.92] P:1783.84 E:0.064796 |  Jack Draper with a Russell Fuller.
[3662.92 - 3664.92] P:1966.15 E:0.068682 |  So thanks to Russell in Rome.
[3664.92 - 3667.92] P:1859.46 E:0.053973 |  He'll obviously keep you updated throughout that tournament.
[3667.92 - 3670.92] P:2013.88 E:0.065408 |  Let's switch from tennis to cricket.
[3670.92 - 3674.92] P:1964.90 E:0.073521 |  And Rohit Sharma has retired from Test cricket, the Indian captain,
[3674.92 - 3678.92] P:2088.93 E:0.069215 |  making that decision six weeks before the series against England,
[3678.92 - 3681.92] P:2002.69 E:0.061833 |  but he will continue to captain the 50-overside,
[3681.92 - 3685.92] P:1986.53 E:0.072189 |  having already retired from the T20 format.
[3685.92 - 3688.92] P:1775.94 E:0.059908 |  Our cricket reporter, Henry Ran, joins us now.
[3688.92 - 3691.92] P:2086.59 E:0.083953 |  His decision, has he been pushed? Why now?
[3691.92 - 3692.92] P:1794.57 E:0.050557 |  Good question.
[3692.92 - 3695.92] P:1439.02 E:0.086163 |  There were reports across Indian media today
[3695.92 - 3699.92] P:1316.77 E:0.084190 |  that suggested that the captaincy was going to be handed to somebody else.
[3699.92 - 3701.92] P:1442.70 E:0.092060 |  His form has been a problem, no question about it.
[3701.92 - 3705.92] P:1331.97 E:0.089025 |  Last three series, he's barely been averaging double figures.
[3705.92 - 3708.92] P:1282.66 E:0.088889 |  And so, yeah, he's a guy who is up there,
[3708.92 - 3712.92] P:1483.77 E:0.087827 |  and the very upper reaches and a history of recent Indian cricket.
[3712.92 - 3714.92] P:1417.84 E:0.087726 |  But his form just hasn't been there.
[3714.92 - 3717.92] P:1251.97 E:0.091470 |  Let's not forget that at the back end of the tour to Australia,
[3717.92 - 3720.92] P:1436.35 E:0.088322 |  he actually dropped himself from the final Test match.
[3720.92 - 3724.92] P:1386.70 E:0.090211 |  And so, I think he possibly realises that he wasn't going to get the opportunity
[3724.92 - 3727.92] P:1367.65 E:0.090973 |  to lead the side, and as soon as that was the case,
[3727.92 - 3730.92] P:1357.31 E:0.084828 |  it was always likely that he would step away from playing Test match cricket.
[3730.92 - 3733.92] P:1593.20 E:0.088786 |  Now, it's an interesting one, this, because who's going to replace him?
[3733.92 - 3737.92] P:1237.38 E:0.096609 |  Is it going to be Jasper Bumrar, a bowler who has captained before,
[3737.92 - 3741.92] P:1230.10 E:0.082936 |  but equally, fast bowlers are a little more susceptible to injuries
[3741.92 - 3743.92] P:1371.40 E:0.094301 |  as Bumrar has been lately.
[3743.92 - 3747.92] P:1490.54 E:0.090767 |  I think more likely is going to be them looking towards a new generation of players
[3747.92 - 3750.92] P:1368.99 E:0.086829 |  and a captain that can lead for the coming years.
[3750.92 - 3753.92] P:1514.26 E:0.091255 |  Somebody like Shun Mungill feels a lot more likely.
[3753.92 - 3757.92] P:1395.23 E:0.085630 |  But certainly this close to a tour and a major Test tour
[3757.92 - 3760.92] P:1513.71 E:0.069302 |  is a little disruptive, I think it's fair to say.
[3760.92 - 3763.92] P:1778.05 E:0.067882 |  Yeah, not quite ready for the 14-year-old, are we?
[3763.92 - 3766.92] P:1520.02 E:0.099204 |  Not as yet. I worked out today that MS Donie
[3766.92 - 3769.92] P:1751.76 E:0.084360 |  was about just under 30 years younger.
[3769.92 - 3772.92] P:1517.35 E:0.092307 |  Older, forgive me, than the 14-year-old.
[3772.92 - 3776.92] P:1620.79 E:0.082163 |  But goodness me, I mean, the depth of talent in Indian cricket is astonishing,
[3776.92 - 3780.92] P:1517.20 E:0.088795 |  and because of the IPL, so many players have got leadership experience as well.
[3780.92 - 3783.92] P:1460.85 E:0.076716 |  They're not going to be short of options, that much is certain.
[3783.92 - 3787.92] P:1781.37 E:0.076935 |  Thank you very much, Henry. Let's go back to Paris Arsenal.
[3787.92 - 3793.92] P:1956.11 E:0.082073 |  Back out, they trail by a golden ill, two-nil on aggregate,
[3793.92 - 3799.92] P:1859.01 E:0.076292 |  a big, huge 45-minute ahead for both of these sides back to Matt and John.
[3799.92 - 3802.92] P:1856.90 E:0.094506 |  Yes, Arsenal have got it all to do.
[3802.92 - 3806.92] P:1892.92 E:0.085975 |  They've got to win this match tonight, and with the second half about to begin,
[3806.92 - 3809.92] P:1954.74 E:0.097754 |  they are losing one-nil, so two-nil on aggregate,
[3809.92 - 3813.92] P:1893.20 E:0.102458 |  just watching Lewis Enrique down there with the goal scorer Fabian Ruiz
[3813.92 - 3817.92] P:1974.04 E:0.097413 |  giving him a hearty pat on the back as he ran out on to the field
[3817.92 - 3820.92] P:1951.13 E:0.093167 |  with some final instructions, no changes at the break.
[3820.92 - 3824.92] P:1920.02 E:0.097469 |  So PSG, Donnaroma in goal, the excellent Donnaroma, he's been cheered here.
[3824.92 - 3828.92] P:1860.45 E:0.095610 |  That's the cheer for Donnaroma from the fans behind the goal to our right,
[3828.92 - 3831.92] P:1814.44 E:0.083713 |  and he uploads back to them to big saves from him in the first half.
[3831.92 - 3836.92] P:1738.75 E:0.089377 |  So Donnaroma, Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho and Mendes on the back four,
[3836.92 - 3840.92] P:1519.43 E:0.093583 |  Arsenal are just about to kick off here, Vettini, Dronnevers and Fabian Ruiz,
[3840.92 - 3845.92] P:1605.32 E:0.103493 |  then Bradley Barcala, Kavica, Kavaric Scalia and Desiree Dua.
[3845.92 - 3848.92] P:1749.95 E:0.097573 |  There's the whistle from Felix Zvaya,
[3848.92 - 3852.92] P:1775.64 E:0.101382 |  and Martin Odegaard plays the ball immediately all the way back to David Ryer,
[3852.92 - 3857.92] P:1803.78 E:0.096473 |  the Arsenal goalkeeper, Ryer in goal, Kimba Saliba, Kivio and Lewis Skelly,
[3857.92 - 3861.92] P:1655.53 E:0.093150 |  then party, Odegaard and Rice in midfield, Saka on the right,
[3861.92 - 3866.92] P:1420.61 E:0.092315 |  Martin Eli on the left and Mikkel Marino playing as the central striker
[3866.92 - 3869.92] P:1567.14 E:0.088677 |  with Kai Havertz on the injured list.
[3869.92 - 3874.92] P:1307.59 E:0.095440 |  Giorgio Ginho is among the substitutes, weren't necessarily expecting that,
[3874.92 - 3878.92] P:1544.86 E:0.080987 |  Calafiore as well, Trossard left out of the team tonight.
[3878.92 - 3883.92] P:1429.06 E:0.092917 |  And Matthew Upsen sitting next to me, Arsenal, an England central defender,
[3883.92 - 3887.92] P:1441.25 E:0.101741 |  played in the Champions League for Arsenal, watching the Arsenal captain,
[3887.92 - 3891.92] P:1539.30 E:0.103539 |  Odegaard who can't bring that ball down, and now Vettini is able to take it away
[3891.92 - 3894.92] P:1369.27 E:0.098418 |  and pass it actually behind Barcala, out under the right wing.
[3894.92 - 3897.92] P:1428.20 E:0.096793 |  Barcala gets the ball under control, he's got Vettini on the overlap,
[3897.92 - 3903.92] P:1326.64 E:0.093941 |  but he goes back to Hakimi and then Hakimi back towards the halfway line.
[3903.92 - 3906.92] P:1451.32 E:0.096966 |  And he's Paris Saint-Germain support as Matt, they're just going to be,
[3906.92 - 3911.92] P:1558.12 E:0.093566 |  this is an anxious 45 minutes watching their clocks as the cross comes over
[3911.92 - 3915.92] P:1570.13 E:0.096032 |  from Hakimi all the way across the Arsenal area, and counting down the time
[3915.92 - 3920.92] P:1673.66 E:0.093574 |  to when they can say that they've done it and they're through to the Champions League final in Munich.
[3920.92 - 3925.92] P:1428.77 E:0.099528 |  Yeah, I mean, such is the confidence and the work rate in this PSG team.
[3925.92 - 3928.92] P:1512.15 E:0.108444 |  I'm not sure if they are going to have a nervous 45 minutes done,
[3928.92 - 3933.92] P:1480.00 E:0.101616 |  but I think they're already a little bit in that celebratory mode, you'd feel,
[3933.92 - 3936.92] P:1465.08 E:0.107285 |  and the stadium's now starting to jump, they're all in unison,
[3936.92 - 3942.92] P:1580.27 E:0.094288 |  there's a chant going round, and I think they're just thoroughly enjoying this situation.
[3942.92 - 3947.92] P:1536.84 E:0.094083 |  Foul on Marino, so to free kick to Arsenal, might be interested to know,
[3947.92 - 3949.92] P:1533.95 E:0.090128 |  as John Cross from the Daily Mirror was telling me,
[3949.92 - 3953.92] P:1505.39 E:0.093540 |  you know the famous song One Nil to the Arsenal, that John says,
[3953.92 - 3959.92] P:1586.21 E:0.085691 |  was actually invented here in this stadium when Arsenal played PSG in the Cup Winners Cup
[3959.92 - 3963.92] P:1671.38 E:0.093513 |  semi-final back in 1994, it was One Nil to Arsenal at halftime,
[3963.92 - 3967.92] P:1637.14 E:0.089477 |  they were playing the Pet Shop Boys, Goal West, and the Arsenal fans,
[3967.92 - 3971.92] P:1543.56 E:0.097877 |  and there'd been a series of One Nil wins during that season in Europe,
[3971.92 - 3976.92] P:1469.95 E:0.095898 |  and at the time George Graham's Arsenal, and it was taken on from there.
[3976.92 - 3981.92] P:1553.90 E:0.084252 |  But tonight, unfortunately for Arsenal, it's One Nil to the PSG,
[3981.92 - 3984.92] P:1708.27 E:0.100514 |  and the free kick has taken long after that foul on Marino,
[3984.92 - 3987.92] P:1567.75 E:0.092831 |  but Martin Elliott's dispossessed, and Paris Saint-Germain,
[3987.92 - 3991.92] P:1557.13 E:0.099985 |  and the mainly blue kick with the red and blue stripe down the middle,
[3991.92 - 3995.92] P:1675.82 E:0.085930 |  burst away forward, Barcalat, but Saliba comes across,
[3995.92 - 3999.92] P:1636.14 E:0.084998 |  forward towards Rice, and back to Audicard just inside his own half,
[3999.92 - 4004.92] P:1590.35 E:0.092669 |  and then all the way back to Kivill, in the middle of Arsenal territory,
[4004.92 - 4007.92] P:1659.63 E:0.090833 |  they're playing from left to right in the second half,
[4007.92 - 4010.92] P:1671.89 E:0.092927 |  passing it forward again to Lewis Skelly, the teenager,
[4010.92 - 4015.92] P:1656.93 E:0.092719 |  as he loves to do, uses his body to hold off Chouinéves,
[4015.92 - 4022.92] P:1579.33 E:0.081960 |  and Arsenal with Pardi a pass forward, which is taken down by Kimba,
[4022.92 - 4025.92] P:1656.72 E:0.091167 |  who's in a well-advanced position, down the line to Saka,
[4025.92 - 4028.92] P:1728.50 E:0.103047 |  but there's Kivarets-Kaelya tackling back on Saka,
[4028.92 - 4030.92] P:1697.18 E:0.107868 |  and it's the Georgian for Paris Saint-Germain,
[4030.92 - 4033.92] P:1630.51 E:0.097511 |  who's come out with a ball against the England International.
[4033.92 - 4035.92] P:1677.71 E:0.081462 |  That's brilliant, that really is brilliant.
[4035.92 - 4038.92] P:1735.34 E:0.097490 |  I really noticed in that first half how hard he was working,
[4038.92 - 4042.92] P:1645.92 E:0.086842 |  and not just the hard work, when he gets there, he then engages,
[4042.92 - 4044.92] P:1556.09 E:0.092626 |  and he's actually a good tackler.
[4044.92 - 4046.92] P:1531.16 E:0.091687 |  He gets in and around the feet of Saka,
[4046.92 - 4050.92] P:1380.09 E:0.094477 |  who hasn't really been able to build any momentum on Arsenal's right-hand side
[4050.92 - 4053.92] P:1510.47 E:0.097718 |  and create as much as what you'd like from him,
[4053.92 - 4055.92] P:1614.19 E:0.087207 |  but I think a lot of it is down to the left-back,
[4055.92 - 4058.92] P:1479.17 E:0.099438 |  he's playing against his outstanding, and Kivarets-Kaelya
[4058.92 - 4061.92] P:1583.05 E:0.086642 |  is just as good when he gets in those defensive positions.
[4061.92 - 4064.92] P:1572.68 E:0.100389 |  Yes, we saw a little group of Georgians, didn't we, outside the parter prince?
[4064.92 - 4067.92] P:1395.96 E:0.079157 |  Just before we came into the stadium.
[4067.92 - 4073.92] P:1587.30 E:0.091825 |  Here, presumably, very proud of the star man, four times Georgian footballer of the year.
[4073.92 - 4075.92] P:1672.51 E:0.097186 |  I suspect he might win it a few more times as well.
[4075.92 - 4076.92] P:1757.03 E:0.078094 |  I think he's got a chance.
[4076.92 - 4079.92] P:1583.58 E:0.105943 |  Here's Saka through the middle, and he's leaned into by Nuno Mendes.
[4079.92 - 4080.92] P:1759.88 E:0.100682 |  That's no free kick.
[4080.92 - 4084.92] P:1716.76 E:0.087482 |  Saka's stayed down, clutching his right leg, PSG in possession,
[4084.92 - 4086.92] P:1525.20 E:0.102697 |  but they don't go gung-ho, they don't need to,
[4086.92 - 4089.92] P:1622.07 E:0.092340 |  and actually, Hakeemi says, I'm going to put this out of play.
[4089.92 - 4093.92] P:1657.72 E:0.075437 |  So Saka can be looked at.
[4093.92 - 4095.92] P:1590.46 E:0.112817 |  I didn't quite see what the issue was there.
[4095.92 - 4098.92] P:1706.95 E:0.095114 |  I mean, the referee hasn't bought any of these situations.
[4098.92 - 4102.92] P:1629.36 E:0.093289 |  I mean, he's let the game flow quite nicely, I think.
[4102.92 - 4104.92] P:1660.02 E:0.116149 |  I mean, there's been a little bit of contact,
[4104.92 - 4107.92] P:1741.38 E:0.117594 |  and maybe a few fouls that could have been given,
[4107.92 - 4109.92] P:1778.20 E:0.109823 |  but just look to the replay.
[4109.92 - 4112.92] P:1760.18 E:0.101008 |  I think Saka just got his leg caught between Mendes' legs,
[4112.92 - 4114.92] P:1708.21 E:0.093745 |  and that's maybe why he's just got that knock.
[4114.92 - 4117.92] P:1755.60 E:0.099138 |  Yeah, he's OK. They're not going to call the physio on,
[4117.92 - 4118.92] P:1669.76 E:0.093508 |  so he's back on his feet.
[4118.92 - 4121.92] P:1612.12 E:0.085338 |  Pukajos Saka, say Alexander Chefri,
[4121.92 - 4123.92] P:1551.64 E:0.094917 |  the UEFA president, is here.
[4123.92 - 4126.92] P:1531.66 E:0.096246 |  Just glanced at the little screen here.
[4126.92 - 4132.92] P:1537.46 E:0.089725 |  I think he's sitting next to the PSG president, Nassar Al-Khalifi.
[4132.92 - 4137.92] P:1615.74 E:0.087986 |  2011, that Qatar first bought into Paris, San-Germain,
[4137.92 - 4140.92] P:1559.66 E:0.098147 |  and some of the managers that they've had, some of the coaches.
[4140.92 - 4144.92] P:1656.41 E:0.092479 |  And, you know, first and foremost, the target is to win the Champions League.
[4144.92 - 4147.92] P:1495.37 E:0.085547 |  They win the French League almost every year,
[4147.92 - 4150.92] P:1711.94 E:0.097488 |  four in a row now, 11 in the last 13 years.
[4150.92 - 4152.92] P:1649.64 E:0.087696 |  The Champions League is the big target.
[4152.92 - 4156.92] P:1726.80 E:0.115435 |  And here, Zvon Neves, winning the ball back for PSG.
[4156.92 - 4159.92] P:1626.59 E:0.094684 |  Then the challenge comes in, good one as well by Pardi,
[4159.92 - 4163.92] P:1662.46 E:0.106066 |  then puts a tackle in on Duit, and that's a sturdy challenge by Timber.
[4163.92 - 4166.92] P:1832.84 E:0.099851 |  It's given us a free kick to Paris, San-Germain,
[4166.92 - 4168.92] P:1806.63 E:0.092581 |  and Timber reacts, going down onto his knees,
[4168.92 - 4173.92] P:1769.29 E:0.086059 |  flops down onto the pitch with his hands in a praying tie.
[4173.92 - 4174.92] P:1505.51 E:0.099868 |  Yeah, looked like a foul to me.
[4174.92 - 4179.92] P:1601.88 E:0.089051 |  He threw himself down like a tantruming three-year-old.
[4179.92 - 4181.92] P:1492.09 E:0.102606 |  If I can split it out.
[4181.92 - 4185.92] P:1570.07 E:0.093242 |  He really did go flat on his front onto his knees.
[4185.92 - 4190.92] P:1478.30 E:0.098904 |  He wins a good chunk of the ball, which is why his reaction was so extreme,
[4190.92 - 4191.92] P:1525.31 E:0.100991 |  but I must say...
[4191.92 - 4192.92] P:1572.44 E:0.072396 |  He slid through.
[4192.92 - 4196.92] P:1549.91 E:0.091299 |  Yeah, he went straight through, and I think the referee, just for the follow-up,
[4196.92 - 4200.92] P:1601.62 E:0.083741 |  the ball kind of glanced off him, but the main bulk and chunk of the contact
[4200.92 - 4202.92] P:1599.44 E:0.090065 |  was with the player, which is why he blew for the foul.
[4202.92 - 4205.92] P:1751.41 E:0.098948 |  This is a free kick, not too far away from the position
[4205.92 - 4208.92] P:1765.27 E:0.087764 |  where PSG scored their goal in the first half.
[4208.92 - 4209.92] P:1797.23 E:0.079268 |  Fittinias, where didn't you take this?
[4209.92 - 4212.92] P:1607.47 E:0.072204 |  Michel Arteta looks anxious.
[4212.92 - 4214.92] P:1757.21 E:0.090214 |  Fittinias swings it in, but he's...
[4214.92 - 4216.92] P:1693.68 E:0.089357 |  Nothing like the delivery in the first half.
[4216.92 - 4219.92] P:1728.73 E:0.082232 |  Curls it into the clubs of Raya, who's able to catch it quite comfortably.
[4219.92 - 4222.92] P:1759.92 E:0.093029 |  Five live BBC sounds, listen as well to Moronite
[4222.92 - 4224.92] P:1706.39 E:0.095944 |  to hear what it sounds like in Bordeaux.
[4224.92 - 4228.92] P:1669.85 E:0.080223 |  Bordeaux glimped the team with the slash in their title,
[4228.92 - 4232.92] P:1516.21 E:0.088460 |  playing Tottenham in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final.
[4232.92 - 4236.92] P:1673.72 E:0.093041 |  So live from Bordeaux to Moronite, we're in Paris tonight.
[4236.92 - 4239.92] P:1765.08 E:0.087508 |  Sports Extra tomorrow night for the commentary on Manchester United.
[4239.92 - 4242.92] P:1703.53 E:0.090163 |  Here, Arsenal in possession. VE Day as well tomorrow,
[4242.92 - 4245.92] P:1765.90 E:0.098091 |  and you'll hear coverage of that all day on five live.
[4245.92 - 4248.92] P:1772.92 E:0.097942 |  As the ball bounces away off Marino and out of play,
[4248.92 - 4249.92] P:1662.79 E:0.101184 |  near the halfway line.
[4249.92 - 4252.92] P:1666.55 E:0.071687 |  Sounds right up your street a bit of Bordeaux.
[4252.92 - 4256.92] P:1550.66 E:0.103508 |  I can see you strolling around there enjoying the culture.
[4256.92 - 4259.92] P:1612.99 E:0.086104 |  I am very, very jealous of them.
[4259.92 - 4264.92] P:1573.82 E:0.086770 |  I would love to have been able to make that trip.
[4264.92 - 4265.92] P:1701.30 E:0.095096 |  Yeah.
[4265.92 - 4268.92] P:1578.24 E:0.082517 |  Raya, long pass from him, downfield.
[4268.92 - 4273.92] P:1720.22 E:0.099080 |  Saka can't keep it in, and it's out of play for a throwing to PSG.
[4273.92 - 4280.92] P:1584.51 E:0.095656 |  However, I think we'll cope here in the fashionable Boulogne-Bilancau area of Paris,
[4280.92 - 4284.92] P:1518.42 E:0.090415 |  where Kashmir is always acceptable.
[4284.92 - 4289.92] P:1510.51 E:0.084770 |  Just looking down the most well-heeled sit down in front of us.
[4289.92 - 4296.92] P:1645.50 E:0.098371 |  There's some wonderfully coiffured hair in the five or six rows that I'm looking down on.
[4296.92 - 4297.92] P:1517.60 E:0.048581 |  It's a lovely park.
[4297.92 - 4298.92] P:1653.52 E:0.119780 |  It's a lovely park.
[4298.92 - 4299.92] P:1497.34 E:0.093134 |  It's a lovely park.
[4299.92 - 4300.92] P:1383.37 E:0.094772 |  Paris, actually.
[4300.92 - 4305.92] P:1485.93 E:0.086900 |  It's a real sporting kind of corner, isn't it, with Longchamp as well,
[4305.92 - 4309.92] P:1486.49 E:0.087874 |  the racing track and all the other sporting.
[4309.92 - 4313.92] P:1695.59 E:0.094285 |  The party has caught in possession on the halfway line,
[4313.92 - 4316.92] P:1533.35 E:0.084296 |  and Arsenal have got men back and PSG.
[4316.92 - 4319.92] P:1596.42 E:0.086970 |  That's another part of this second half.
[4319.92 - 4323.92] P:1748.06 E:0.093011 |  This is so big for Paris Saint-Germain, and this is mainly a young team,
[4323.92 - 4326.92] P:1496.54 E:0.085555 |  and they talk about it all of the time.
[4326.92 - 4329.92] P:1722.92 E:0.108265 |  Whether the pressures will come into it, there's no pressure here.
[4329.92 - 4332.92] P:1801.37 E:0.099834 |  Nuno Mendes, pouring forward from left back, playing it across.
[4332.92 - 4334.92] P:1824.63 E:0.103575 |  Dewey turns and shoots go.
[4334.92 - 4337.92] P:1739.06 E:0.102142 |  It's opened his body, very La Mignamal-like, actually,
[4337.92 - 4339.92] P:1755.40 E:0.087545 |  on the other side of the penalty area.
[4339.92 - 4344.92] P:1666.90 E:0.088915 |  Quick play, opened his body, that steered the shot well wide, actually.
[4344.92 - 4347.92] P:1569.41 E:0.089006 |  Well, this PSG left side is the best in world football.
[4347.92 - 4348.92] P:1434.19 E:0.091284 |  It really is.
[4348.92 - 4352.92] P:1423.41 E:0.091523 |  I mean, the quality and the speed they have between the Mendes
[4352.92 - 4355.92] P:1506.77 E:0.093464 |  and Caravaj Kelya is just blistering,
[4355.92 - 4359.92] P:1425.83 E:0.094580 |  and that with the intelligence, the work ethic, the quality,
[4359.92 - 4362.92] P:1481.52 E:0.086449 |  it literally has everything, this left-hand side,
[4362.92 - 4366.92] P:1419.81 E:0.093833 |  and it's been such a challenging tie for Paquio Saka to get in the game,
[4366.92 - 4369.92] P:1543.38 E:0.088496 |  understandably, because you're up against two players
[4369.92 - 4373.92] P:1463.43 E:0.081877 |  that are very, very difficult to get on top of.
[4373.92 - 4375.92] P:1527.31 E:0.088684 |  Best left flank in world football.
[4375.92 - 4378.92] P:1530.24 E:0.085244 |  I think so at the moment. I don't think there's a better one.
[4378.92 - 4380.92] P:1620.34 E:0.098129 |  Not the half-sign this season.
[4380.92 - 4383.92] P:1673.65 E:0.115011 |  When Luis Enrique won the Champions League, when he was coach of Barcelona,
[4383.92 - 4387.92] P:1605.53 E:0.108401 |  he had Suarez and Messi and Neymar, but here's Bárcala.
[4387.92 - 4392.92] P:1690.34 E:0.094447 |  Bárcala carrying the ball into the area, still Bárcala puts his foot on the ball,
[4392.92 - 4394.92] P:1780.80 E:0.078565 |  little pass, chipped across the goal by Petina,
[4394.92 - 4399.92] P:1710.03 E:0.088102 |  and that's easily chested back by Timber to goalkeeper Raya.
[4399.92 - 4401.92] P:1696.73 E:0.089637 |  Almost ten minutes played in the second half,
[4401.92 - 4406.92] P:1648.44 E:0.095701 |  and I must say now it does feel as though that first 20-25 minutes of this match
[4406.92 - 4411.92] P:1771.71 E:0.102830 |  before Luis gave PSG the lead, and they could have scored before then as well,
[4411.92 - 4414.92] P:1680.92 E:0.078887 |  but I think particularly the first 20 minutes,
[4414.92 - 4419.92] P:1499.90 E:0.078273 |  if it doesn't go for Arsenal tonight, which it's not doing with this scoreline,
[4419.92 - 4420.92] P:1592.84 E:0.075874 |  that's where they've lost it.
[4420.92 - 4424.92] P:1471.58 E:0.085947 |  When you play as well as what they did, and you get nothing for it,
[4424.92 - 4428.92] P:1608.25 E:0.080041 |  it hurts, it takes a chunk out of you, you feel,
[4428.92 - 4431.92] P:1574.54 E:0.089389 |  and then you're dealing with the quality on the counter,
[4431.92 - 4435.92] P:1617.19 E:0.092164 |  and the, you know, hitting the post, and then the goal,
[4435.92 - 4437.92] P:1431.72 E:0.091434 |  and all of a sudden it's like a sinking feeling.
[4437.92 - 4442.92] P:1429.93 E:0.095458 |  So Arsenal have got to dig in deep here, they're still in this match,
[4442.92 - 4445.92] P:1610.54 E:0.093530 |  they have to work hard, if they can just get anything,
[4445.92 - 4449.92] P:1604.13 E:0.092666 |  it might just make that last piece of this game a little bit difficult for PSG.
[4449.92 - 4452.92] P:1699.08 E:0.097562 |  Raya long free kick, forward to the edge of the area,
[4452.92 - 4456.92] P:1666.61 E:0.101328 |  Marino jumps for it, but it bounces through and is cleared away to the halfway line,
[4456.92 - 4461.92] P:1711.20 E:0.111824 |  where Barclay is in a bit of a candle there with Lewis Skelly,
[4461.92 - 4463.92] P:1775.43 E:0.111720 |  who has fouled him, says referee's via,
[4463.92 - 4467.92] P:1730.22 E:0.091398 |  and that's a yellow card for the Arsenal teenager, Lewis Skelly.
[4467.92 - 4471.92] P:1541.07 E:0.093610 |  Nothing worse than when you're waiting for the ball to come down
[4471.92 - 4474.92] P:1411.32 E:0.090719 |  and you've got a player that's got momentum coming onto it,
[4474.92 - 4476.92] P:1478.12 E:0.096299 |  and he's just in a difficult position there, Lewis Skelly.
[4476.92 - 4479.92] P:1614.64 E:0.099417 |  He loves to just stick his body between the man and the ball,
[4479.92 - 4482.92] P:1588.19 E:0.098164 |  that's his go-to all the time, and Barclay read it, got round him,
[4482.92 - 4485.92] P:1515.46 E:0.074538 |  and then he had to pull him down.
[4485.92 - 4489.92] P:1481.79 E:0.094972 |  One nail to Paris Saint-Germain, two nail on aggregate,
[4489.92 - 4491.92] P:1681.74 E:0.092775 |  Nuno Mendes goes down, no free kick,
[4491.92 - 4495.92] P:1618.20 E:0.083340 |  Cavarra T'Caillier is in possession of the ball with his wispy beard
[4495.92 - 4499.92] P:1577.73 E:0.092441 |  and his white strapping on his wrist turns, goes down,
[4499.92 - 4502.92] P:1647.70 E:0.112716 |  it's taken on though by Vitinha, excellent footwork from Vitinha,
[4502.92 - 4505.92] P:1686.44 E:0.106002 |  still going Vitinha, and it's clipped across via a deflection,
[4505.92 - 4508.92] P:1830.07 E:0.097133 |  but caught by Raya stretching,
[4508.92 - 4512.92] P:1661.73 E:0.098040 |  what a piece of play that was by the Portuguese number 17.
[4512.92 - 4515.92] P:1532.08 E:0.103099 |  Cross, some twinkle toes, that one, a lovely lift at the start
[4515.92 - 4519.92] P:1510.52 E:0.096345 |  to lift the ball down the line over the outstretched leg of Timber,
[4519.92 - 4524.92] P:1445.33 E:0.098882 |  and then the footwork going into the box was really, really magical.
[4524.92 - 4528.92] P:1576.24 E:0.108659 |  Yes, he didn't have the best of times by any means at Wolves when he was there,
[4528.92 - 4531.92] P:1531.78 E:0.100028 |  he didn't play enough, he came in and spoke to us at the Emirates last week
[4531.92 - 4537.92] P:1480.13 E:0.089157 |  and he was talking about how looking back, that was very important and good for him,
[4537.92 - 4541.92] P:1564.42 E:0.090340 |  but I think the meaning there was, I didn't really enjoy it very much.
[4541.92 - 4545.92] P:1751.19 E:0.094519 |  He has ordered guard, forward to Saka, now Arsenal could be interested,
[4545.92 - 4548.92] P:1810.31 E:0.103311 |  Saka with the shot from the angle, but Nuno Mendes puts a foot out
[4548.92 - 4551.92] P:1810.17 E:0.100817 |  and blocks it behind, wider than the opposed, corner Arsenal though.
[4551.92 - 4554.92] P:1709.81 E:0.084495 |  It's almost the best outcome Arsenal could have, you know,
[4554.92 - 4557.92] P:1784.29 E:0.104901 |  Mendes 1v1, you're not going to get too much change out of him,
[4557.92 - 4559.92] P:1805.15 E:0.109297 |  but if Saka can keep winning, this set plays,
[4559.92 - 4564.92] P:1923.81 E:0.096212 |  if Arsenal can keep putting the ball in the box as many times as they can,
[4564.92 - 4568.92] P:1915.16 E:0.099412 |  probability says something's going to drop at some point.
[4569.92 - 4574.92] P:1987.72 E:0.098143 |  Corner then, one of Arsenal's big, big strengths.
[4574.92 - 4577.92] P:1976.34 E:0.101817 |  Over the course of the last couple of seasons,
[4577.92 - 4581.92] P:1995.54 E:0.101305 |  no Gabrielle at the moment though, one of the main dangers, however,
[4581.92 - 4584.92] P:1975.63 E:0.094374 |  there are still dangers there, little steps from Saka,
[4584.92 - 4589.92] P:1894.38 E:0.086294 |  in comes the corner and it's pushed up and over the top by Donnaroma.
[4589.92 - 4594.92] P:1830.93 E:0.092397 |  It was dropping in, but Donnaroma, 6'5", was able to reach up
[4594.92 - 4596.92] P:1899.33 E:0.101998 |  and just push it over the top of the bar, second corner.
[4596.92 - 4600.92] P:1938.85 E:0.103694 |  Yeah, comfortable, wasn't it? I mean, he gets too much curl in the ball there, Saka.
[4600.92 - 4604.92] P:1938.43 E:0.092270 |  He wants to set that a little bit further out near the 6-yard box line.
[4604.92 - 4608.92] P:1961.01 E:0.104924 |  Saka again then, second right-sided corner in a row,
[4608.92 - 4611.92] P:2019.07 E:0.096542 |  and it goes on Donnaroma, came off an Arsenal head,
[4611.92 - 4613.92] P:1785.08 E:0.096608 |  even though the goalkeeper went for it.
[4613.92 - 4616.92] P:1825.63 E:0.083110 |  Mikael Moreno's claiming that the final touch was off a PSG body,
[4616.92 - 4620.92] P:1797.05 E:0.094566 |  but referees via well-position says goal kick.
[4620.92 - 4624.92] P:1661.97 E:0.102232 |  Yeah, decent ball in and good flick, just everyone had gone into the middle of the box
[4624.92 - 4628.92] P:1614.08 E:0.101635 |  and nobody drifted out. Somebody just pulled onto the back post area.
[4628.92 - 4633.92] P:1504.51 E:0.090490 |  There was a simple header in an empty net, but there was completely empty of any player.
[4636.92 - 4641.92] P:1442.01 E:0.098404 |  Yeah, I think the final touch was off Timber.
[4641.92 - 4643.92] P:1366.89 E:0.084484 |  You can see that now.
[4643.92 - 4645.92] P:1634.60 E:0.100076 |  So goal kick, referee got it right.
[4645.92 - 4649.92] P:1568.49 E:0.086244 |  Goal kick to Paris Saint-Germain, just over half an hour to play.
[4649.92 - 4652.92] P:1455.59 E:0.085430 |  PSG half an hour from going to Munich.
[4652.92 - 4656.92] P:1580.13 E:0.080141 |  Arsenal half an hour from going out.
[4656.92 - 4663.92] P:1609.82 E:0.087621 |  It would be a fourth defeat out of four for Mikael Arteta in two-legged semi-finals
[4663.92 - 4665.92] P:1523.55 E:0.079094 |  as the Arsenal manager.
[4665.92 - 4671.92] P:1700.72 E:0.096463 |  How's your look? Saka bundled over by a patch hole.
[4671.92 - 4673.92] P:1776.22 E:0.089264 |  He's fallen off the pitch, but it is.
[4673.92 - 4677.92] P:1706.32 E:0.089323 |  It's a free kick to Arsenal on the right-hand side, Audegarde runs off the pitch.
[4677.92 - 4681.92] P:1646.09 E:0.087089 |  Arsenal just need to... whatever, however they do it, just find a way through.
[4681.92 - 4683.92] P:1675.12 E:0.099249 |  Find a way past Donoruma.
[4683.92 - 4685.92] P:1614.54 E:0.085444 |  That isn't a good decision from Paco.
[4685.92 - 4687.92] P:1702.30 E:0.107089 |  It doesn't need to give that foul away.
[4687.92 - 4691.92] P:1859.34 E:0.096127 |  Really clumsy, smashes into the back of Saka right on the touch line.
[4691.92 - 4694.92] P:1956.29 E:0.097100 |  He's going nowhere, now Martin Audegarde can place the ball.
[4694.92 - 4700.92] P:1905.48 E:0.088890 |  This is a lovely angle for him, John with his left foot, just to witness one in.
[4700.92 - 4705.92] P:1962.44 E:0.092075 |  The Arsenal captain with his left foot waits to deliver this.
[4705.92 - 4708.92] P:1990.63 E:0.097772 |  He has created three goals in the last four matches.
[4708.92 - 4711.92] P:1796.94 E:0.096961 |  Audegarde plays it in, Donoruma comes, gets a good punch on that.
[4711.92 - 4713.92] P:1741.24 E:0.089809 |  Well out of the penalty area.
[4713.92 - 4719.92] P:1746.02 E:0.084509 |  Barcala just heads it back to Fabian Ruiz, the scorer of the only goal tonight.
[4719.92 - 4723.92] P:1764.73 E:0.086511 |  The man who scored the goal in the first leg, Usman Dembele,
[4723.92 - 4727.92] P:1519.08 E:0.098801 |  only on the bench for PSG this evening, the 33-goal top scorer,
[4727.92 - 4731.92] P:1590.34 E:0.095807 |  but they've not needed him so far as Timber on the right wing wins it.
[4731.92 - 4735.92] P:1650.99 E:0.090089 |  The throw-in, Arsenal are building a little bit of pressure here.
[4735.92 - 4739.92] P:1581.86 E:0.091992 |  Timber wins the throw-in, just looking to see if party is going to come
[4739.92 - 4742.92] P:1654.43 E:0.092993 |  and take the long one, but he's not.
[4742.92 - 4744.92] P:1770.11 E:0.097845 |  Maybe just a little too far up behind.
[4744.92 - 4745.92] P:1591.47 E:0.106490 |  I think he is.
[4745.92 - 4746.92] P:1642.30 E:0.116916 |  Oh no, here he is, he is coming.
[4746.92 - 4747.92] P:1639.93 E:0.060810 |  They have to.
[4747.92 - 4750.92] P:1474.67 E:0.102538 |  And also they have caused problems with it.
[4750.92 - 4755.92] P:1479.56 E:0.090146 |  They have to, I mean, in open play at the moment it's hard to see
[4755.92 - 4757.92] P:1315.24 E:0.093382 |  where the goals are going to come from with Arsenal.
[4757.92 - 4760.92] P:1543.03 E:0.082733 |  I mean that has been a big problem that there's this season,
[4760.92 - 4762.92] P:1484.87 E:0.091813 |  but they have a chance with these long throws.
[4762.92 - 4764.92] P:1680.57 E:0.103652 |  Here it goes, we're right behind the line of it.
[4764.92 - 4766.92] P:1790.55 E:0.077453 |  The throw is headed away on the edge of the box.
[4766.92 - 4769.92] P:1645.55 E:0.091223 |  Saliba though is able to steer it back out to party.
[4769.92 - 4773.92] P:1681.28 E:0.093054 |  Party beats the jumping Douay, then plays it back to the edge of the area.
[4773.92 - 4776.92] P:1834.43 E:0.102199 |  Timber back to party, party right for it across the box,
[4776.92 - 4780.92] P:1747.86 E:0.092751 |  but right into the path of Pat Cho, who is able to clear away for Paris Saint-Germain.
[4780.92 - 4781.92] P:1812.09 E:0.088840 |  Arsenal come again.
[4781.92 - 4785.92] P:1837.35 E:0.095921 |  Saliba's crossed this time right away to the far side of the penalty area.
[4785.92 - 4787.92] P:1839.56 E:0.076310 |  Marino backing away, turns.
[4787.92 - 4789.92] P:1843.92 E:0.112108 |  Oh, and he's got it all wrong.
[4789.92 - 4792.92] P:1851.41 E:0.112517 |  He's past it behind Martin Elliott all the way through for a goal kick.
[4792.92 - 4796.92] P:1769.26 E:0.105732 |  And you can hear what that's done to the PSG supporters who like us,
[4796.92 - 4797.92] P:1932.05 E:0.085830 |  we're watching.
[4797.92 - 4799.92] P:1734.84 E:0.093415 |  Arsenal have a spell there, but it's gone.
[4799.92 - 4800.92] P:1310.98 E:0.070750 |  And what was it like?
[4800.92 - 4805.92] P:1500.74 E:0.093792 |  It was again, it was really good foundations, good movement, technique,
[4805.92 - 4809.92] P:1417.51 E:0.091646 |  all the rest, but without that final piece at the end.
[4809.92 - 4812.92] P:1587.36 E:0.090327 |  And until they find that somewhere,
[4812.92 - 4815.92] P:1490.10 E:0.084455 |  PSG are going to feel relatively comfortable,
[4815.92 - 4818.92] P:1575.88 E:0.096597 |  because while they might have those moments where they're under pressure,
[4818.92 - 4821.92] P:1485.12 E:0.091945 |  I don't think they really feel massively threatened that Arsenal are going to score.
[4821.92 - 4822.92] P:1504.79 E:0.107760 |  No.
[4822.92 - 4826.92] P:1482.21 E:0.085373 |  It feels now like it's not going to go Arsenal's way,
[4826.92 - 4831.92] P:1641.63 E:0.084726 |  but I've sat and watched enough surprise turnarounds in my life
[4831.92 - 4833.92] P:1714.01 E:0.094957 |  to not give this one up just yet.
[4833.92 - 4837.92] P:1708.61 E:0.079787 |  And it is incredible how it can change,
[4837.92 - 4841.92] P:1728.05 E:0.095626 |  and the mood of a match can change so quickly.
[4844.92 - 4847.92] P:1415.50 E:0.099602 |  But I'm not stacking my house on this happening tonight.
[4847.92 - 4851.92] P:1640.85 E:0.092950 |  Here is Hakimi playing the ball out to the far side.
[4851.92 - 4854.92] P:1463.05 E:0.089394 |  Shroud Nevers, that's a heavy touch from him,
[4854.92 - 4856.92] P:1541.19 E:0.094135 |  out of play for a throw.
[4856.92 - 4858.92] P:1667.69 E:0.098961 |  Miles Lewis-Skelly takes this,
[4858.92 - 4861.92] P:1802.06 E:0.085441 |  pulls it down the line, this is from Artinelli to Chase,
[4861.92 - 4864.92] P:1708.72 E:0.100763 |  and the cross comes Marquinhos to put it out of play.
[4864.92 - 4870.92] P:1650.85 E:0.090489 |  Marquinhos was one of the goal scorers when PSG won their only previous victory
[4870.92 - 4872.92] P:1520.49 E:0.102832 |  in a Champions League semi-final.
[4872.92 - 4875.92] P:1756.48 E:0.086698 |  And if you remember, that was back in the Covid year,
[4875.92 - 4878.92] P:1847.87 E:0.091830 |  in 2020, when it was a one-off semi-final against Leipzig.
[4878.92 - 4882.92] P:1910.97 E:0.102805 |  So PSG have never won a two-legged Champions League semi-final.
[4882.92 - 4884.92] P:1929.59 E:0.091344 |  That's what they're trying to do tonight.
[4884.92 - 4886.92] P:1896.07 E:0.100163 |  Last season they lost both legs 1-0.
[4886.92 - 4888.92] P:1942.69 E:0.102287 |  This season they're winning both legs 1-0.
[4888.92 - 4890.92] P:1869.09 E:0.103182 |  Long throttle for party.
[4890.92 - 4892.92] P:1958.34 E:0.094038 |  Bounces out to the edge of the penalty area, Timber couldn't get there.
[4892.92 - 4894.92] P:1802.65 E:0.096981 |  Dua is barged off the ball by Odegard,
[4894.92 - 4896.92] P:1650.10 E:0.100195 |  I'm surprised that wasn't given as a free kick.
[4896.92 - 4899.92] P:1730.77 E:0.098826 |  Fabian Ruiz has been able to clear it away downfield.
[4899.92 - 4900.92] P:1677.94 E:0.112440 |  Saliba's got to be careful.
[4900.92 - 4903.92] P:1826.92 E:0.107763 |  Saliba might be in danger of losing out there.
[4903.92 - 4906.92] P:1678.00 E:0.112369 |  That might be in danger of losing out to Barcala,
[4906.92 - 4909.92] P:1786.08 E:0.105420 |  but in the end he's managed to draw the foul from Barcala.
[4909.92 - 4912.92] P:1886.39 E:0.107402 |  They don't like it in the stands of the Parc de Prince,
[4912.92 - 4915.92] P:1877.77 E:0.098239 |  but Arsenal now already the urgency is there.
[4915.92 - 4918.92] P:1948.86 E:0.087389 |  Quick free kick, played forward, Rice gets it back,
[4918.92 - 4921.92] P:1934.52 E:0.092822 |  Rice's ball across, deflected right across.
[4921.92 - 4924.92] P:1863.28 E:0.085952 |  Beyond the far post, Saka, dropped behind it.
[4924.92 - 4926.92] P:1968.52 E:0.103291 |  Saka, then back to Timber.
[4926.92 - 4929.92] P:1999.64 E:0.100241 |  Timber gives it back to Saka.
[4929.92 - 4932.92] P:2028.19 E:0.116071 |  Saka now onto his left foot, curls it, go, it's off!
[4932.92 - 4935.92] P:1854.36 E:0.102324 |  What a save again from Donorama.
[4935.92 - 4938.92] P:1841.29 E:0.110232 |  I thought that was bound for the top corner.
[4938.92 - 4940.92] P:1751.07 E:0.099477 |  I thought that was beating the big man,
[4940.92 - 4943.92] P:1629.13 E:0.104249 |  but he threw out one of those arms,
[4943.92 - 4946.92] P:1630.32 E:0.109149 |  fingertips again, round the top corner.
[4946.92 - 4948.92] P:1600.21 E:0.103544 |  Oh, what a save.
[4948.92 - 4950.92] P:1511.24 E:0.103504 |  And what a hit from Saka.
[4950.92 - 4953.92] P:1565.05 E:0.108552 |  We've been asking for an Arsenal player to produce something a bit special.
[4953.92 - 4956.92] P:1539.82 E:0.099561 |  That was it from Bacchio Saka.
[4956.92 - 4959.92] P:1686.51 E:0.103335 |  For the first time in the game, he gets himself a couple of yards away from Mendes.
[4959.92 - 4962.92] P:1880.62 E:0.097898 |  He whips it with his left foot, and what a fingertips save.
[4962.92 - 4965.92] P:1970.35 E:0.093197 |  With the right hand from Donorama, he's gone in the top corner.
[4965.92 - 4968.92] P:1922.49 E:0.094563 |  Rice with the corner, deep to the back post.
[4968.92 - 4971.92] P:1784.90 E:0.095889 |  Pardi tried to get there, Defendo's in the way, comes out to Saka,
[4971.92 - 4975.92] P:1738.69 E:0.109872 |  goes down, threw himself down, Clarence Galea tells him what he thinks of him.
[4975.92 - 4977.92] P:1689.69 E:0.110088 |  Meanwhile, PSG are off on the counterattack.
[4977.92 - 4980.92] P:1721.85 E:0.103917 |  It's Hakimi who's taking the ball down the left wing,
[4980.92 - 4983.92] P:1739.04 E:0.093066 |  but they're not going gung-ho, duee, though, so says, give it to me.
[4983.92 - 4986.92] P:1731.63 E:0.094120 |  And then he gives it back to Hakimi, and Hakimi shoots,
[4986.92 - 4988.92] P:1783.06 E:0.095320 |  and Raya's able to go down to his right.
[4988.92 - 4992.92] P:1707.32 E:0.096634 |  Took a little deflection that Raya was able to feel that down to his right.
[4992.92 - 4995.92] P:1650.81 E:0.093993 |  Yeah, gave it the ball a nasty little bit of movement there, didn't it?
[4995.92 - 4998.92] P:1640.97 E:0.092044 |  You know, one of those ones that you can see squirm under the arms of goalkeepers.
[4998.92 - 5002.92] P:1481.32 E:0.086615 |  They did quite well there, Dabin Raya, to get solid forearms behind that ball.
[5002.92 - 5007.92] P:1529.30 E:0.092945 |  It was a tricky save, but, you know, PSG, for that breakaway there, John,
[5007.92 - 5011.92] P:1479.15 E:0.086375 |  like you mentioned, they didn't really go for the throat, did they?
[5011.92 - 5013.92] P:1674.61 E:0.077102 |  There's a feeling now that we're comfortable.
[5013.92 - 5017.92] P:1542.49 E:0.095543 |  You know, we've got two goals, we're in control.
[5017.92 - 5020.92] P:1651.35 E:0.098085 |  If we can break forward, then great, but if not, no problem.
[5020.92 - 5022.92] P:1587.83 E:0.082734 |  We'll just keep the ball and run the time down.
[5022.92 - 5025.92] P:1514.51 E:0.093538 |  Patchall steps forward, stabs it away.
[5025.92 - 5029.92] P:1565.84 E:0.091394 |  William Patchall, the Ecuadorian central defender.
[5029.92 - 5032.92] P:1824.54 E:0.100880 |  He's good, isn't he? 23 years old.
[5032.92 - 5036.92] P:1734.86 E:0.093981 |  Arsenal again in possession on the left-hand side.
[5036.92 - 5040.92] P:1755.64 E:0.090843 |  Saka, the latest to have been denied by Donnarumma.
[5040.92 - 5045.92] P:1524.75 E:0.083115 |  Saka must be thinking what do I have to do to beat Donnarumma.
[5045.92 - 5047.92] P:1510.42 E:0.098706 |  Remember the Euros final.
[5047.92 - 5049.92] P:1803.59 E:0.095231 |  And here he is now.
[5049.92 - 5052.92] P:1815.37 E:0.102665 |  He's popped up on the left-hand side, Bucayo Saka trying to come in field,
[5052.92 - 5054.92] P:1760.87 E:0.091757 |  but well defended.
[5054.92 - 5058.92] P:1763.98 E:0.091116 |  Excellent midfield play from Shroud Neves, who got in there,
[5058.92 - 5059.92] P:1701.12 E:0.102380 |  won the ball against Saka.
[5059.92 - 5061.92] P:1693.73 E:0.097015 |  Then he's felled by Moreno.
[5061.92 - 5064.92] P:1734.64 E:0.103757 |  The referee's just simply to go to the streets.
[5064.92 - 5067.92] P:1807.97 E:0.085409 |  Suggesting that he is going to be called to the screen.
[5067.92 - 5069.92] P:1575.79 E:0.093678 |  Yeah. What was that about?
[5069.92 - 5072.92] P:1814.64 E:0.083007 |  And there is a potential penalty check.
[5072.92 - 5075.92] P:1758.01 E:0.095084 |  So this, I guess, well, it would have to be for an Arsenal penalty
[5075.92 - 5077.92] P:1849.55 E:0.095077 |  because the ball's not been in the PSG penalty yet.
[5077.92 - 5080.92] P:1702.05 E:0.098016 |  Surely not the Saka swan dive that we've got.
[5080.92 - 5084.92] P:1792.79 E:0.077468 |  We brushed that off as if it was a...
[5084.92 - 5088.92] P:1751.08 E:0.093917 |  Well, and you know what this means?
[5088.92 - 5092.92] P:1822.14 E:0.109706 |  Usually, when the referee is called across by the VAR,
[5092.92 - 5094.92] P:1846.79 E:0.104951 |  who is Bastien Dankert,
[5094.92 - 5097.92] P:1950.26 E:0.113626 |  it's a handball against Arsenal.
[5097.92 - 5099.92] P:1899.61 E:0.119729 |  Oh!
[5099.92 - 5101.92] P:1810.86 E:0.121949 |  It was when Hakini went for goal.
[5101.92 - 5103.92] P:1856.41 E:0.098449 |  It was when Hakini shot for goal,
[5103.92 - 5107.92] P:1738.46 E:0.086586 |  and it did say deflected off Lewis Skelly.
[5107.92 - 5113.92] P:1766.51 E:0.088127 |  And a penalty has been awarded by Felix Zvaya.
[5113.92 - 5114.92] P:1653.44 E:0.083053 |  Wow.
[5114.92 - 5117.92] P:1830.22 E:0.085648 |  And Miles Lewis Skelly was twisting his body.
[5117.92 - 5119.92] P:1758.44 E:0.093302 |  And I think he's a little unfortunate there
[5119.92 - 5121.92] P:1607.12 E:0.095766 |  for that to be given as a handball against him.
[5121.92 - 5124.92] P:1641.14 E:0.095493 |  I would say a little unfortunate.
[5124.92 - 5126.92] P:1607.96 E:0.114418 |  His hand is just...
[5126.92 - 5128.92] P:1701.99 E:0.112345 |  The arm is at right angles.
[5128.92 - 5129.92] P:1702.99 E:0.108913 |  Yeah, but...
[5129.92 - 5131.92] P:1797.83 E:0.104144 |  I mean, he's twisted his body.
[5131.92 - 5134.92] P:1736.36 E:0.106839 |  But, you know, in Europe, with Miles off being reasonable
[5134.92 - 5136.92] P:1722.82 E:0.094476 |  with these handball situations,
[5136.92 - 5139.92] P:1725.13 E:0.105447 |  you know, the Premier League's gone so far
[5139.92 - 5143.92] P:1665.39 E:0.097624 |  in actually applying a little bit of rationale and common sense
[5143.92 - 5145.92] P:1394.55 E:0.111237 |  to the situation that the player's in.
[5145.92 - 5148.92] P:1569.44 E:0.098669 |  There's no thought for the situation that Lewis Skelly's in.
[5148.92 - 5150.92] P:1550.68 E:0.104136 |  Is his arm away from his body?
[5150.92 - 5151.92] P:1684.75 E:0.095979 |  Yes.
[5151.92 - 5154.92] P:1465.22 E:0.093771 |  But he's trying to break,
[5154.92 - 5158.92] P:1592.28 E:0.096317 |  change direction, and block a shot at the same time.
[5158.92 - 5161.92] P:1402.17 E:0.093134 |  Your arms are not going to be down your side like a penguin.
[5161.92 - 5164.92] P:1533.02 E:0.096587 |  So they're going to be free-flowing in that natural movement.
[5164.92 - 5168.92] P:1402.40 E:0.092473 |  He smashes the ball from two yards away from him.
[5168.92 - 5172.92] P:1585.36 E:0.089485 |  How on earth is he supposed to get his arm or hand out the way?
[5172.92 - 5175.92] P:1536.30 E:0.098327 |  And to get penalised, very similar to the game away
[5175.92 - 5178.92] P:1578.23 E:0.083359 |  into the Arsenal had in the Champions League this year.
[5178.92 - 5180.92] P:1458.46 E:0.098374 |  A ridiculous handball.
[5180.92 - 5181.92] P:1606.43 E:0.104146 |  Marina, that one.
[5181.92 - 5183.92] P:1486.05 E:0.085033 |  This is just another one. And it's needless.
[5183.92 - 5186.92] P:1631.00 E:0.084573 |  I mean, for VAR to call that back,
[5186.92 - 5190.92] P:1665.83 E:0.086537 |  to think that there's a clear and obvious error
[5190.92 - 5192.92] P:1623.81 E:0.069962 |  from the referee in that decision,
[5192.92 - 5194.92] P:1672.57 E:0.092913 |  I find ludicrous.
[5194.92 - 5197.92] P:1332.00 E:0.100218 |  I think it's a total misuse of what VAR is there for.
[5197.92 - 5201.92] P:1552.03 E:0.097277 |  It's the kind of decision that is given in European competitions.
[5201.92 - 5203.92] P:1441.83 E:0.087584 |  Yeah, but it's ridiculous.
[5203.92 - 5205.92] P:1513.99 E:0.087585 |  And if the referee gives it on field even,
[5205.92 - 5207.92] P:1519.12 E:0.089835 |  I would be upset with it.
[5207.92 - 5210.92] P:1624.99 E:0.088493 |  But for the VAR to bring it back
[5210.92 - 5212.92] P:1593.42 E:0.078418 |  and say there's a clear problem here,
[5212.92 - 5214.92] P:1654.61 E:0.093519 |  it's just ridiculous.
[5214.92 - 5217.92] P:1564.18 E:0.080810 |  Well, Arsenal need David Ryer here.
[5217.92 - 5220.92] P:1488.88 E:0.092918 |  Remember his penalty save against Atalanta
[5220.92 - 5223.92] P:1724.16 E:0.095643 |  in the league phase of the competition.
[5223.92 - 5226.92] P:1697.32 E:0.086341 |  Brilliant double save from Retege.
[5226.92 - 5229.92] P:1693.93 E:0.070524 |  Well, he's going to face Vittinia,
[5229.92 - 5231.92] P:1837.64 E:0.095788 |  the little Portuguese midfielder.
[5231.92 - 5233.92] P:1569.38 E:0.091688 |  So it's a penalty.
[5233.92 - 5236.92] P:1737.95 E:0.105236 |  Arsenal have made a change.
[5236.92 - 5239.92] P:1833.72 E:0.091452 |  Trossard has come on and Califiori.
[5239.92 - 5242.92] P:1729.71 E:0.100244 |  So Louis Skelly and Martin Elliott have been substituted.
[5242.92 - 5245.92] P:1735.21 E:0.103535 |  Meanwhile, here is the moment that could clinch it
[5245.92 - 5247.92] P:1742.10 E:0.071709 |  for Paris Saint-Germain.
[5247.92 - 5250.92] P:1619.61 E:0.081930 |  Vittinia stands right behind the ball
[5250.92 - 5252.92] P:1675.78 E:0.071197 |  on the edge of the area.
[5252.92 - 5254.92] P:1788.80 E:0.089570 |  Little steps forward, a crouching motion.
[5254.92 - 5257.92] P:1731.02 E:0.097404 |  He walks up to the ball and then...
[5257.92 - 5259.92] P:1876.61 E:0.111894 |  Ryer saves it down to his left.
[5259.92 - 5261.92] P:1642.77 E:0.091914 |  Pushes it away.
[5261.92 - 5265.92] P:1721.23 E:0.094898 |  Not the most firmly hit penalty you've ever seen.
[5265.92 - 5268.92] P:1646.32 E:0.105415 |  I think he was hoping that Ryer was going to commit himself,
[5268.92 - 5271.92] P:1683.89 E:0.095285 |  but Ryer keeps it out and it's still 1-0 on the night.
[5271.92 - 5275.92] P:1686.93 E:0.100329 |  2-0 on aggregate and Arsenal are still just about alive.
[5275.92 - 5278.92] P:1548.05 E:0.087071 |  Wow, that was a bizarre approach to the ball.
[5278.92 - 5281.92] P:1761.38 E:0.099595 |  It was like he was trying to creep up on it, John.
[5281.92 - 5283.92] P:1619.50 E:0.100366 |  Tiptoeing.
[5283.92 - 5285.92] P:1767.99 E:0.106438 |  I almost felt like saying,
[5285.92 - 5288.92] P:1737.39 E:0.099602 |  you go down to the woods to get it.
[5290.92 - 5292.92] P:1705.83 E:0.113351 |  It had that feel.
[5292.92 - 5294.92] P:1782.80 E:0.110725 |  It was a really poor penalty.
[5294.92 - 5297.92] P:1675.33 E:0.112041 |  I don't quite know what that was, but there's no power.
[5297.92 - 5300.92] P:1613.80 E:0.086867 |  You've got no momentum coming into the ball
[5300.92 - 5302.92] P:1622.48 E:0.093542 |  because you're creeping up on it.
[5302.92 - 5306.92] P:1709.39 E:0.092981 |  And then no power, and David Ryer holds his nerve really well, actually.
[5306.92 - 5310.92] P:1699.75 E:0.091137 |  He's in the corner, so he has to really get across to his left-hand side,
[5310.92 - 5312.92] P:1677.38 E:0.097325 |  but good save.
[5312.92 - 5315.92] P:1598.61 E:0.098854 |  Arsenal have changed their left flank, and now Dan Bale is on.
[5315.92 - 5318.92] P:1712.16 E:0.095202 |  Booseman Dan Bale coming on for the last 20 minutes.
[5318.92 - 5322.92] P:1583.70 E:0.092627 |  Went off injured, the man who scored the goal in the first leg.
[5322.92 - 5325.92] P:1640.44 E:0.086890 |  The top scorer, 33 goals this season.
[5325.92 - 5329.92] P:1625.51 E:0.085861 |  28 in his last 28 appearances.
[5329.92 - 5331.92] P:1600.66 E:0.080444 |  That's not bad.
[5331.92 - 5334.92] P:1602.43 E:0.095659 |  And it's a PSG corner after the Ryer penalty save.
[5334.92 - 5338.92] P:1373.80 E:0.089405 |  And corner from the right-hand side.
[5338.92 - 5341.92] P:1486.04 E:0.084205 |  One nil on the night, two nil on aggregate.
[5341.92 - 5343.92] P:1533.62 E:0.097568 |  PSG going through.
[5343.92 - 5346.92] P:1397.02 E:0.072695 |  Here is the corner, but Oda the near post headed away for Arsenal.
[5346.92 - 5348.92] P:1690.69 E:0.090148 |  And then nodded to the man who's just had his penalty save,
[5348.92 - 5351.92] P:1612.41 E:0.068910 |  Vettini, who, with his right foot,
[5351.92 - 5354.92] P:1628.91 E:0.094178 |  brings Dan Bale into the game for the first time.
[5354.92 - 5358.92] P:1799.85 E:0.075534 |  And then he's a throwing off Timber.
[5358.92 - 5362.92] P:1510.12 E:0.082080 |  So Barca making way for Dan Bale.
[5362.92 - 5367.92] P:1245.24 E:0.091228 |  So I think if that had gone in,
[5367.92 - 5371.92] P:1434.39 E:0.086544 |  I think you'd have heard that all around Paris, the cheer,
[5371.92 - 5376.92] P:1564.04 E:0.082632 |  outside the ground, but instead, David Ryer has kept Arsenal in it.
[5376.92 - 5381.92] P:1605.84 E:0.095338 |  And as you said, Matt, you do feel for Arsenal and Lewis Skelly
[5381.92 - 5383.92] P:1646.51 E:0.093275 |  being pulled up for that.
[5383.92 - 5386.92] P:1797.72 E:0.098735 |  But here's Calafiori back from injury, not played in the last 10 matches.
[5386.92 - 5389.92] P:1525.32 E:0.082995 |  Calafiori into the penalty area, but overruns it.
[5389.92 - 5391.92] P:1524.87 E:0.106173 |  And PSG are able to clear it away
[5391.92 - 5394.92] P:1716.84 E:0.103603 |  and actually might be able to break away up the right-hand side.
[5394.92 - 5397.92] P:1563.86 E:0.080269 |  So with Barca being substituted,
[5397.92 - 5400.92] P:1443.00 E:0.088718 |  Douay was over there on the right-hand side.
[5400.92 - 5402.92] P:1605.01 E:0.090660 |  Hakimi's now bursting forward as well.
[5402.92 - 5404.92] P:1667.47 E:0.090329 |  Douay turns on the edge of the box.
[5404.92 - 5407.92] P:1535.66 E:0.078458 |  That was well defended though for Arsenal by Saliba,
[5407.92 - 5410.92] P:1580.29 E:0.086693 |  who passes it to Crossard, who's onto the field now.
[5410.92 - 5412.92] P:1775.94 E:0.092631 |  Crossard having started the last four matches,
[5412.92 - 5416.92] P:1718.81 E:0.074486 |  but on the substitutes bench tonight, back to party,
[5416.92 - 5419.92] P:1720.99 E:0.105265 |  time now very much beginning to run out for Arsenal.
[5419.92 - 5423.92] P:1813.77 E:0.089255 |  We're in the last 20 minutes, 71 minutes play.
[5423.92 - 5425.92] P:1798.02 E:0.091280 |  Arsenal with Bukai Osaka,
[5425.92 - 5429.92] P:1836.11 E:0.079544 |  who forced the best save of the second half from Donorumma.
[5429.92 - 5432.92] P:1654.15 E:0.083824 |  He's in contention to be man of the match again.
[5432.92 - 5436.92] P:1575.80 E:0.083687 |  The PSG goalkeeper into the centre-circle.
[5436.92 - 5438.92] P:1530.90 E:0.082911 |  It is with Kibyo.
[5438.92 - 5441.92] P:1658.97 E:0.100325 |  He's given it away past it behind Oda Gard,
[5441.92 - 5445.92] P:1670.31 E:0.094127 |  so Kibara Tsukeliya was able to pick up possession of the ball
[5445.92 - 5449.92] P:1690.20 E:0.103087 |  and now glides forward in that way that he does the Georgia number seven
[5449.92 - 5451.92] P:1561.23 E:0.099404 |  and then pulls it back to the edge of the box,
[5451.92 - 5453.92] P:1752.07 E:0.088290 |  not cleared by party.
[5453.92 - 5457.92] P:1649.94 E:0.118268 |  Hakimi! Right foot, bottom corner!
[5457.92 - 5462.92] P:1666.76 E:0.118431 |  The right back has clinched it, surely, for Paris Saint-Germain.
[5464.92 - 5467.92] P:1651.41 E:0.112143 |  That's finished the semi-final.
[5467.92 - 5472.92] P:1651.29 E:0.111358 |  Surely it has, and it's finished off Arsenal as well.
[5472.92 - 5476.92] P:1632.12 E:0.114889 |  Nikolaj Tepa stands with his arms crossed.
[5476.92 - 5480.92] P:1611.90 E:0.109844 |  Two-nil on the night, three-nil on aggregate.
[5480.92 - 5483.92] P:1620.09 E:0.111325 |  PSG are bound for Munich.
[5483.92 - 5486.92] P:1593.02 E:0.115245 |  Wow, this place has just erupted.
[5486.92 - 5489.92] P:1574.94 E:0.104706 |  They know they're home and dry.
[5489.92 - 5492.92] P:1597.02 E:0.105429 |  And Arsenal are out of this game.
[5492.92 - 5496.92] P:1622.06 E:0.102365 |  The body language, the dejected look on the players says it all.
[5496.92 - 5499.92] P:1517.55 E:0.104875 |  I mean, it was a tired piece of defending,
[5499.92 - 5502.92] P:1465.68 E:0.101379 |  and Arsenal have put so much into this game.
[5502.92 - 5504.92] P:1480.19 E:0.113922 |  They really have.
[5504.92 - 5507.92] P:1289.57 E:0.097168 |  They've run their socks off, and PSG now in a position
[5507.92 - 5511.92] P:1466.62 E:0.107529 |  where they can just exploit those little holes.
[5511.92 - 5514.92] P:1391.42 E:0.105294 |  And it's Hakimi with a lovely sweeping right foot,
[5514.92 - 5517.92] P:1489.27 E:0.103382 |  with finish, it really is a well-taken goal.
[5517.92 - 5519.92] P:1406.92 E:0.090244 |  Krabats-Kaliya gets the ball wide.
[5519.92 - 5522.92] P:1446.17 E:0.092414 |  Arsenal don't quite deal with it, and then it's a bit tired.
[5522.92 - 5524.92] P:1610.56 E:0.095400 |  Kibyo doesn't get out to the ball.
[5524.92 - 5527.92] P:1484.20 E:0.099603 |  Saliba's a little bit deep, and it just allows Hakimi,
[5527.92 - 5531.92] P:1610.03 E:0.101421 |  the space and time, 18 yards out, to wrap his foot round.
[5531.92 - 5537.92] P:1626.05 E:0.089297 |  And what he does, he rips it beautifully around Saliba,
[5537.92 - 5540.92] P:1522.03 E:0.080484 |  and it nestles right in the bottom of the far corner,
[5540.92 - 5544.92] P:1536.53 E:0.096898 |  just hits the inside, grazes the inside of the side netting,
[5544.92 - 5547.92] P:1573.87 E:0.089592 |  probably about two or three inches inside the post.
[5547.92 - 5550.92] P:1536.90 E:0.089501 |  Beautiful finish with his right foot.
[5550.92 - 5553.92] P:1608.65 E:0.091146 |  And Luis Enrique with a two-nil lead on the night,
[5553.92 - 5555.92] P:1658.42 E:0.097715 |  three-nil on aggregate.
[5555.92 - 5557.92] P:1644.14 E:0.105503 |  Luis Enrique immediately says,
[5557.92 - 5560.92] P:1737.17 E:0.106098 |  right, let's be having one of those forwards off, two a's off.
[5560.92 - 5566.92] P:1650.32 E:0.097325 |  And Lucas Hernandez, the French international,
[5566.92 - 5570.92] P:1559.45 E:0.104906 |  is coming on, the number 21.
[5570.92 - 5574.92] P:1586.76 E:0.108205 |  So he's playing on the left-hand side of the defence,
[5574.92 - 5579.92] P:1575.45 E:0.103821 |  which I guess means, what, three central defenders now for PSG?
[5579.92 - 5581.92] P:1607.39 E:0.102288 |  No-no-mendes playing as the left wing back.
[5581.92 - 5585.92] P:1625.57 E:0.108265 |  Yeah, you think that probably looks the luck he's set up for.
[5585.92 - 5587.92] P:1407.96 E:0.107542 |  Or indeed, no-no-mendes just playing further forward.
[5587.92 - 5589.92] P:1490.27 E:0.117144 |  Yeah, I think he's gone further forward in that position,
[5589.92 - 5591.92] P:1633.91 E:0.103486 |  and Hernandez will go to the left back.
[5591.92 - 5597.92] P:1567.06 E:0.097128 |  But, you know, what a scoreline to keep a clean sheet
[5597.92 - 5599.92] P:1709.32 E:0.109967 |  at the moment against Arsenal.
[5599.92 - 5602.92] P:1692.91 E:0.086219 |  I mean, Donnarumma has been hugely influential in that,
[5602.92 - 5606.92] P:1778.22 E:0.088281 |  but Paris, in full control of this tie now,
[5606.92 - 5608.92] P:1666.99 E:0.097430 |  and the supporters are just enjoying themselves.
[5608.92 - 5611.92] P:1657.95 E:0.105985 |  Yeah, and again, it's not a new conversation.
[5611.92 - 5616.92] P:1669.17 E:0.099353 |  We'll be talking about Arsenal and it being another one of those games
[5616.92 - 5620.92] P:1666.08 E:0.090555 |  where they couldn't find the goals that they needed.
[5620.92 - 5623.92] P:1688.56 E:0.090359 |  That's, you know, the draws that they've had in the Premier League.
[5623.92 - 5625.92] P:1702.23 E:0.101496 |  13 draws in the Premier League this season.
[5625.92 - 5629.92] P:1595.27 E:0.104763 |  Yeah, I mean, you've got no centre-forward on the pitch,
[5629.92 - 5633.92] P:1511.33 E:0.106335 |  and, you know, Martinelli's not in a big goal-scoring form.
[5633.92 - 5635.92] P:1480.83 E:0.107413 |  Saka weighs in with his...
[5636.92 - 5638.92] P:1586.10 E:0.116915 |  A good haul of goals most season,
[5638.92 - 5641.92] P:1599.53 E:0.086752 |  but, you know, they have to work incredibly hard
[5641.92 - 5646.92] P:1800.09 E:0.090022 |  and get incredibly creative in order to get that goal tally up.
[5646.92 - 5649.92] P:1714.00 E:0.081898 |  And, you know, there's been a few little mistakes
[5649.92 - 5651.92] P:1532.31 E:0.092533 |  starting to creep in as well.
[5651.92 - 5654.92] P:1450.54 E:0.097124 |  They've conceded a lot from set plays in the last 10 games,
[5654.92 - 5657.92] P:1675.19 E:0.112709 |  and Saliba's making a few little errors with the ball,
[5657.92 - 5659.92] P:1696.83 E:0.095072 |  and just a few things that have crept into the game
[5659.92 - 5661.92] P:1760.86 E:0.091432 |  that have added to this situation,
[5661.92 - 5665.92] P:1541.88 E:0.090825 |  but, you know, it's been a difficult season for Arsenal,
[5665.92 - 5669.92] P:1669.06 E:0.103252 |  and this game is maybe just that one game too far
[5669.92 - 5671.92] P:1434.17 E:0.100874 |  after brilliant performances against Madrid.
[5671.92 - 5674.92] P:1672.68 E:0.114287 |  So 2-0 on the night, Fabian Ruiz in the first half,
[5674.92 - 5680.92] P:1567.87 E:0.096928 |  and the excellent Atra Hakini, the former Real Madrid and Inter man.
[5680.92 - 5681.92] P:1467.12 E:0.075842 |  Yeah.
[5681.92 - 5685.92] P:1822.27 E:0.091559 |  So up against his former club, and the final he will be,
[5685.92 - 5689.92] P:1774.47 E:0.092494 |  and he's produced some great moments,
[5689.92 - 5691.92] P:1903.63 E:0.106489 |  as Trossard wins the ball back from Marquinhos,
[5691.92 - 5695.92] P:1865.38 E:0.095508 |  and here's Saka, Saka's in, and Saka scores!
[5695.92 - 5699.92] P:1812.73 E:0.097496 |  And Arsenal have got a goal back with 15 minutes to play.
[5699.92 - 5702.92] P:1908.98 E:0.105773 |  Marquinhos is saying that he was fouled by Trossard,
[5702.92 - 5704.92] P:1816.53 E:0.095836 |  referee's not interested,
[5704.92 - 5707.92] P:1749.24 E:0.094741 |  and Saka finally has been able to get the ball in the net
[5707.92 - 5709.92] P:1761.68 E:0.096846 |  past Donnarumma.
[5709.92 - 5712.92] P:1715.14 E:0.101744 |  2-1 on the night now, 3-1 on aggregate.
[5712.92 - 5716.92] P:1433.33 E:0.092664 |  From where I'm sat, I think the referee makes an excellent call.
[5716.92 - 5720.92] P:1480.48 E:0.087016 |  It's a gutsy call as well, because everything's screaming
[5720.92 - 5722.92] P:1443.08 E:0.088518 |  to say this is a foul, but for me, Marquinhos,
[5722.92 - 5724.92] P:1777.71 E:0.102527 |  he knows Trossard's behind him,
[5724.92 - 5727.92] P:1622.21 E:0.088278 |  and he just puts the brakes on and then falls on top of the ball.
[5727.92 - 5730.92] P:1719.82 E:0.088924 |  Like so many players do, and the referee just instantly gives a foul,
[5730.92 - 5733.92] P:1611.45 E:0.090407 |  and he doesn't, because he reads it and thinks,
[5733.92 - 5735.92] P:1567.60 E:0.089942 |  well, you're trying to buy that foul,
[5735.92 - 5737.92] P:1514.03 E:0.093779 |  is there contact in a bit of a shove from Trossard?
[5737.92 - 5739.92] P:1401.22 E:0.098657 |  Yes, there is, but not enough to fall over.
[5739.92 - 5741.92] P:1653.88 E:0.102199 |  He thinks he can just fall on the ball,
[5741.92 - 5743.92] P:1799.08 E:0.095280 |  and the referee will give him the foul, and he doesn't.
[5743.92 - 5745.92] P:1865.64 E:0.088743 |  Then it just ends up in the box.
[5745.92 - 5747.92] P:1564.49 E:0.085063 |  There's loads of movement.
[5747.92 - 5749.92] P:1596.08 E:0.078185 |  Saka's running across.
[5749.92 - 5753.92] P:1457.09 E:0.094228 |  Donnarumma gets the save, or a block, or maybe it was a Hakimi,
[5753.92 - 5756.92] P:1393.95 E:0.101011 |  and then it's a simple tapping just from three yards out
[5756.92 - 5759.92] P:1384.43 E:0.099662 |  into an empty net for Saka, and Arsenal are on the score sheet.
[5759.92 - 5764.92] P:1484.38 E:0.085665 |  2-1 on the night, 3-1 on aggregate.
[5764.92 - 5766.92] P:1690.51 E:0.090217 |  There was a very handy deflection, actually,
[5766.92 - 5768.92] P:1744.73 E:0.093219 |  from the Trossard pass-off, Pacho,
[5768.92 - 5771.92] P:1676.78 E:0.083576 |  which took it to Saka with Donnarumma going down.
[5771.92 - 5774.92] P:1769.67 E:0.101673 |  Here's another ball in, and Saka in the middle
[5774.92 - 5777.92] P:1743.62 E:0.090421 |  couldn't get his head to it, as Lucas Hernandez actually came across.
[5777.92 - 5781.92] P:1722.74 E:0.094611 |  And suddenly, there's a little bit of concern here in the PSG defence.
[5781.92 - 5783.92] P:1644.43 E:0.093246 |  Donnarumma coming out, and he's asking questions.
[5783.92 - 5785.92] P:1759.82 E:0.098398 |  He's saying, what's going on here?
[5785.92 - 5787.92] P:1721.46 E:0.096106 |  You know, they very nearly had another goal there, Arsenal.
[5787.92 - 5790.92] P:1539.70 E:0.084323 |  He's losing his rag with Gaviraj Kailia.
[5790.92 - 5792.92] P:1469.45 E:0.094611 |  He really has had a go at him,
[5792.92 - 5794.92] P:1597.74 E:0.095113 |  and he's kind of pointed to himself going, what me?
[5794.92 - 5796.92] P:1580.58 E:0.111548 |  Donnarumma's going, yeah, you.
[5796.92 - 5799.92] P:1632.58 E:0.103503 |  He wasn't happy with the intensity in which he got after the ball
[5799.92 - 5803.92] P:1366.71 E:0.084198 |  and stopped Arsenal developing something down the left-hand side.
[5804.92 - 5810.92] P:1583.34 E:0.089044 |  So Bukajosaka means Arsenal are on the board, as Jhvn Nevers fires the ball forward,
[5810.92 - 5813.92] P:1747.92 E:0.086179 |  but the referee's going to bring it back for the PSG free-kick
[5813.92 - 5815.92] P:1610.63 E:0.091156 |  half-inside their own half.
[5815.92 - 5818.92] P:1626.26 E:0.090801 |  So Bukajosaka becomes the first Arsenal player to score in a semi-final
[5818.92 - 5824.92] P:1546.32 E:0.089119 |  since Nicolas Pepe scored with a penalty against Villarreal
[5824.92 - 5827.92] P:1632.21 E:0.091374 |  in 2021 in the Europa League semi-final.
[5827.92 - 5833.92] P:1622.58 E:0.086879 |  So that run of six semi-final matches without scoring a goal,
[5833.92 - 5834.92] P:1438.64 E:0.101004 |  that is all about.
[5834.92 - 5839.92] P:1610.03 E:0.097250 |  However, I think the phrase that we'll probably use is too little, too late.
[5839.92 - 5841.92] P:1400.60 E:0.099931 |  Well, you did say earlier...
[5841.92 - 5843.92] P:1404.95 E:0.093694 |  Still got 12 minutes to play.
[5843.92 - 5845.92] P:1404.16 E:0.108641 |  You said earlier that these games can turn quickly.
[5845.92 - 5848.92] P:1764.83 E:0.109901 |  And PSG have given it away, and Reiss now to Odegard,
[5848.92 - 5852.92] P:1718.87 E:0.089602 |  and Odegard with a flick into the path of Patro of PSG,
[5852.92 - 5856.92] P:1608.53 E:0.091443 |  who's able to just belt it away to the halfway line.
[5856.92 - 5857.92] P:1742.61 E:0.095924 |  That's a good situation.
[5857.92 - 5859.92] P:1500.40 E:0.100738 |  They turned the ball over in a really dangerous area.
[5859.92 - 5862.92] P:1643.03 E:0.088524 |  Martin Odegard tried to clever little back heel flick through,
[5862.92 - 5866.92] P:1564.07 E:0.086271 |  and Pacho, who has just covered that back line so well,
[5866.92 - 5868.92] P:1510.21 E:0.080220 |  he's such a tough player to get around.
[5868.92 - 5872.92] P:1630.80 E:0.105573 |  He just seems to read the line of the ball and get blocks,
[5872.92 - 5874.92] P:1737.56 E:0.085899 |  stops a little pathways through.
[5874.92 - 5877.92] P:1708.53 E:0.089721 |  There are jitters here for PSG.
[5877.92 - 5881.92] P:1427.74 E:0.090728 |  Saka's now playing centrally, and here they come again.
[5881.92 - 5884.92] P:1545.22 E:0.083107 |  Trossard, Trossard, back towards the halfway line.
[5884.92 - 5885.92] P:1488.67 E:0.088640 |  You know, this is the pressure.
[5885.92 - 5888.92] P:1540.79 E:0.092080 |  These are the nerves jangling at a team that, you know,
[5888.92 - 5890.92] P:1772.99 E:0.096778 |  a few moments ago, thought the job was done.
[5890.92 - 5893.92] P:1805.29 E:0.113776 |  Saka, oh, the chance!
[5893.92 - 5895.92] P:1618.74 E:0.092335 |  Saka's put it over the bar.
[5895.92 - 5897.92] P:1768.82 E:0.097114 |  Kala Fiori's crossed.
[5897.92 - 5899.92] P:1676.60 E:0.098509 |  Donnaruma came for it, didn't get there,
[5899.92 - 5904.92] P:1510.86 E:0.093029 |  and behind him, Saka couldn't direct the shot under the crossbar.
[5904.92 - 5907.92] P:1595.60 E:0.097837 |  Open goal over the top.
[5907.92 - 5909.92] P:1510.25 E:0.096645 |  I can't believe he's missed it.
[5909.92 - 5911.92] P:1529.52 E:0.117361 |  He can't believe he's missed it.
[5911.92 - 5915.92] P:1500.72 E:0.106939 |  Sat on the floor with his hands on top of his head, he knows.
[5915.92 - 5917.92] P:1431.91 E:0.099675 |  This was a massive chance.
[5917.92 - 5920.92] P:1482.37 E:0.084898 |  I mean, he's just got to take the pace off it a little bit
[5920.92 - 5923.92] P:1633.80 E:0.098599 |  and get his upper body over the ball and caress it.
[5923.92 - 5926.92] P:1701.72 E:0.089179 |  Any kind of touch that's underneath the crossbars
[5926.92 - 5928.92] P:1673.97 E:0.090306 |  in the back of the net is flashed across.
[5928.92 - 5929.92] P:1592.32 E:0.111015 |  Brilliant ball in.
[5929.92 - 5931.92] P:1629.65 E:0.089511 |  Donnaruma's at full stretch. He doesn't get there.
[5931.92 - 5933.92] P:1480.07 E:0.094126 |  It goes past the goalkeeper.
[5933.92 - 5934.92] P:1575.32 E:0.107023 |  Saka arrives.
[5934.92 - 5936.92] P:1509.60 E:0.096128 |  He's been in that area, like you said,
[5936.92 - 5939.92] P:1416.40 E:0.099232 |  centrally or in the back post every time the play's developing
[5939.92 - 5942.92] P:1450.07 E:0.083322 |  down the left, and he just can't keep the effort down
[5942.92 - 5943.92] P:1705.24 E:0.091546 |  under the crossbars.
[5943.92 - 5945.92] P:1426.13 E:0.092199 |  It'd just be in the back of the net, and wow,
[5945.92 - 5948.92] P:1479.57 E:0.096705 |  that would set up the last 10, 15 minutes of this game brilliantly.
[5948.92 - 5950.92] P:1757.53 E:0.109094 |  The Jitters are on here for Paris Saint-Germain.
[5950.92 - 5951.92] P:1661.00 E:0.093279 |  Yes.
[5951.92 - 5953.92] P:1763.31 E:0.105714 |  And there in the space of maybe two or three minutes,
[5953.92 - 5956.92] P:1731.39 E:0.093834 |  Arsenal scored one and could have scored two more.
[5956.92 - 5957.92] P:1509.59 E:0.093867 |  Here's Timber.
[5957.92 - 5960.92] P:1645.73 E:0.103042 |  Timber coming forward, gets up, loses out.
[5960.92 - 5963.92] P:1632.60 E:0.110513 |  Nuno Mendes is going to play the ball out to Cavarra-Tecalier,
[5963.92 - 5965.92] P:1669.18 E:0.114223 |  who's over there on the right-hand side.
[5965.92 - 5968.92] P:1702.60 E:0.104368 |  Hakini's making a run through the middle again.
[5968.92 - 5969.92] P:1686.57 E:0.095514 |  That's typical, then.
[5969.92 - 5971.92] P:1887.20 E:0.093249 |  Cavarra-Tecalier, though, keeps running,
[5971.92 - 5973.92] P:1818.90 E:0.101896 |  and then finds the pass to Fabian Ruiz,
[5973.92 - 5975.92] P:1637.44 E:0.104984 |  and then Dembale with a shot.
[5975.92 - 5977.92] P:1762.40 E:0.081175 |  Raya's able to, period,
[5977.92 - 5980.92] P:1592.99 E:0.086883 |  push it away back into the penalty area,
[5980.92 - 5983.92] P:1615.79 E:0.101898 |  comes back to Dembale, and then there's a foul
[5983.92 - 5988.92] P:1768.87 E:0.104429 |  on Xhwau Neves, centrally by Marino.
[5988.92 - 5991.92] P:1631.08 E:0.101238 |  We saw the waving of the imaginary yellow card
[5991.92 - 5993.92] P:1449.98 E:0.102068 |  from little Neves when he was sitting on the ground.
[5993.92 - 5996.92] P:1513.29 E:0.110694 |  It's a free kick, no more than that.
[5996.92 - 5998.92] P:1474.82 E:0.105860 |  Well, that needs a yellow card for him, then, doesn't it?
[5998.92 - 6000.92] P:1443.53 E:0.092976 |  It should be, anyway.
[6000.92 - 6002.92] P:1541.37 E:0.106176 |  I mean, the big difference in this game,
[6002.92 - 6005.92] P:1503.98 E:0.084016 |  when Paris come forward like that,
[6005.92 - 6009.92] P:1568.17 E:0.089898 |  you feel like they're manufacturing slicker,
[6009.92 - 6011.92] P:1626.38 E:0.089543 |  better goalscoring opportunities
[6011.92 - 6013.92] P:1732.65 E:0.074642 |  than what Arsenal have done.
[6013.92 - 6016.92] P:1556.37 E:0.099754 |  They're getting these wide players on the ball,
[6016.92 - 6020.92] P:1499.10 E:0.091694 |  whichever ones have mixed up the movements all into changing,
[6020.92 - 6023.92] P:1348.64 E:0.105292 |  but then once they get their one or two passes off,
[6023.92 - 6026.92] P:1589.60 E:0.093742 |  they really do create a good bit of space and good opportunity,
[6026.92 - 6029.92] P:1501.00 E:0.084956 |  and their clinical edge has been good in this game.
[6029.92 - 6031.92] P:1671.38 E:0.094139 |  Five lives from the BBC.
[6031.92 - 6033.92] P:1586.16 E:0.099394 |  We're live here at the Parc de France.
[6033.92 - 6035.92] P:1831.22 E:0.078302 |  That's Matthew Upson.
[6035.92 - 6038.92] P:1536.04 E:0.085071 |  A little later on, we will, on BBC One,
[6038.92 - 6040.92] P:1768.62 E:0.095441 |  have the highlights, Champions League match of the day,
[6040.92 - 6043.92] P:1534.21 E:0.080013 |  the highlights of this match and tomorrow, last night,
[6043.92 - 6047.92] P:1502.97 E:0.085568 |  and they'll be on the iPlayer as well after 10 o'clock,
[6047.92 - 6050.92] P:1398.11 E:0.090436 |  so you can find the Champions League highlights there.
[6050.92 - 6052.92] P:1561.32 E:0.101021 |  And a free kick for Paris Saint-Germain,
[6052.92 - 6055.92] P:1730.09 E:0.093144 |  which is taken short, and then the shot is squeezed in
[6055.92 - 6058.92] P:1824.70 E:0.091390 |  from probably 35 yards,
[6058.92 - 6060.92] P:1729.60 E:0.084597 |  and passed by Vettini as a hechini.
[6060.92 - 6062.92] P:1649.95 E:0.088823 |  They hit it well enough, but it was pulled away,
[6062.92 - 6065.92] P:1613.36 E:0.088828 |  left of the goal and behind for a goal kick.
[6065.92 - 6068.92] P:1700.41 E:0.085419 |  Ben White's going to come on as well for Arsenal very shortly,
[6068.92 - 6071.92] P:1597.85 E:0.084515 |  and Timber probably did well to make this.
[6071.92 - 6074.92] P:1501.49 E:0.087069 |  And Nicolò Teth is frustrated,
[6074.92 - 6076.92] P:1646.68 E:0.092853 |  because he wanted to make the substitution there.
[6076.92 - 6079.92] P:1454.19 E:0.092735 |  Arsenal through the middle, Marino,
[6079.92 - 6082.92] P:1601.44 E:0.104067 |  here's Declan Rice, Declan Rice had a little look there,
[6082.92 - 6085.92] P:1841.84 E:0.090910 |  he's onside, the cross hits, Nuno Mendes,
[6085.92 - 6088.92] P:1844.88 E:0.094321 |  then back to Timber, now Declan Rice again,
[6088.92 - 6092.92] P:1957.83 E:0.111713 |  Rice a packed penalty area, Saliba to party,
[6092.92 - 6096.92] P:2009.62 E:0.100626 |  now Audegarde, Audegarde holds off Nuno Mendes,
[6096.92 - 6098.92] P:1737.44 E:0.110510 |  and then the ball bounces away from Declan Rice,
[6098.92 - 6100.92] P:1611.74 E:0.099353 |  and Nuno Mendes is able to bring it forward
[6100.92 - 6102.92] P:1698.50 E:0.090975 |  and then hit a long crossfield pass,
[6102.92 - 6105.92] P:1714.51 E:0.100911 |  that's for Hakimi to chase, his energy is incredible,
[6105.92 - 6107.92] P:1727.13 E:0.096124 |  but he overhits that out of play, and it's a throw in the last night.
[6107.92 - 6110.92] P:1671.04 E:0.094626 |  That was a steam train in the up and down the right,
[6110.92 - 6113.92] P:1639.72 E:0.090802 |  I mean, one minute he's back, and then he's halfway up the pitch,
[6113.92 - 6115.92] P:1574.10 E:0.107102 |  and then he's back again, I mean, he gets everywhere.
[6115.92 - 6119.92] P:1588.07 E:0.081869 |  He was telling us yesterday about his nutritionist, Hakimi.
[6119.92 - 6121.92] P:1580.03 E:0.111624 |  He's obviously feeding him the right stuff.
[6121.92 - 6123.92] P:1530.70 E:0.098116 |  Yeah, what's he eating, John?
[6123.92 - 6125.92] P:1531.03 E:0.094603 |  Well, he didn't kill us.
[6125.92 - 6127.92] P:1449.31 E:0.100282 |  Disclose.
[6127.92 - 6130.92] P:1510.29 E:0.094380 |  No, it's full of whatever it needs to be.
[6130.92 - 6132.92] P:1387.59 E:0.101167 |  Raya, long downfield over the top of Saka,
[6132.92 - 6136.92] P:1652.59 E:0.098496 |  then Audegarde on the challenge with Vettini,
[6136.92 - 6140.92] P:1691.12 E:0.094422 |  we've got the chaos that Arsenal needed,
[6140.92 - 6143.92] P:1599.21 E:0.092402 |  but TSG have got the lead that they need.
[6143.92 - 6146.92] P:1513.35 E:0.087909 |  Two-one on the night, three-one on aggregate.
[6146.92 - 6148.92] P:1551.14 E:0.080043 |  Well, Arsenal had the chance as well, though, didn't they?
[6148.92 - 6151.92] P:1358.12 E:0.078061 |  I mean, that from Saka should be in the back of the net.
[6151.92 - 6154.92] P:1462.93 E:0.088104 |  He should have two goals in this game,
[6154.92 - 6157.92] P:1447.36 E:0.082620 |  and also Donnarama, the save he made from him with his left foot
[6157.92 - 6158.92] P:1375.35 E:0.090874 |  was absolutely outstanding.
[6158.92 - 6161.92] P:1304.89 E:0.087898 |  They've had their chances, Arsenal, in fairness.
[6161.92 - 6163.92] P:1276.06 E:0.080220 |  I mean, you have to take your hat off
[6163.92 - 6165.92] P:1458.22 E:0.086238 |  to the way they've gone about the game.
[6167.92 - 6169.92] P:1701.59 E:0.115361 |  Six minutes to play.
[6170.92 - 6172.92] P:1502.97 E:0.073072 |  Plus added time.
[6172.92 - 6176.92] P:1472.55 E:0.079257 |  Arsenal somehow have got to come up with two goals
[6176.92 - 6178.92] P:1354.86 E:0.079841 |  without reply.
[6180.92 - 6184.92] P:1827.16 E:0.104194 |  Paul has deflected out for a PSG throw.
[6184.92 - 6189.92] P:1613.04 E:0.087047 |  So, Timberwos, replaced by Ben White.
[6189.92 - 6192.92] P:1441.45 E:0.090824 |  So, White now operating at right back.
[6192.92 - 6198.92] P:1512.68 E:0.083617 |  And Arsenal with Saliba in possession.
[6198.92 - 6200.92] P:1604.09 E:0.109691 |  Long and forward from Calafiori.
[6200.92 - 6201.92] P:1600.66 E:0.103242 |  It's a long one.
[6201.92 - 6204.92] P:1779.23 E:0.086226 |  This is for Trossard to chase Marquinhos.
[6204.92 - 6206.92] P:1685.12 E:0.106425 |  Comes out with the ball,
[6206.92 - 6208.92] P:1793.86 E:0.096623 |  excellently defended by the PSG captain,
[6208.92 - 6210.92] P:1585.41 E:0.087551 |  the Brazilian captain as well.
[6210.92 - 6216.92] P:1669.62 E:0.093287 |  Hakini then allows Jair Neves to find Dembele.
[6216.92 - 6219.92] P:1693.33 E:0.107507 |  And Dembele's first-time pass will run to Hakini.
[6219.92 - 6221.92] P:1749.89 E:0.103242 |  Hakini right side of the box.
[6221.92 - 6222.92] P:1777.15 E:0.093302 |  Arsenal have got men back.
[6222.92 - 6224.92] P:1777.63 E:0.097274 |  Kvaratskjelja, though, in the area.
[6224.92 - 6225.92] P:1819.92 E:0.081451 |  It's now very congested in there,
[6225.92 - 6227.92] P:1616.52 E:0.093700 |  as Kvaratskjelja takes it back out
[6227.92 - 6229.92] P:1486.54 E:0.089337 |  into the left-back area.
[6229.92 - 6232.92] P:1635.27 E:0.100279 |  And is being followed all the way out there by Saliba.
[6232.92 - 6234.92] P:1722.69 E:0.085265 |  He's trying to draw the foul.
[6234.92 - 6236.92] P:1682.33 E:0.108598 |  He's taking it towards the corner flag.
[6236.92 - 6237.92] P:1605.29 E:0.073426 |  Then he goes down.
[6237.92 - 6241.92] P:1547.38 E:0.080225 |  And then the ball has actually run for Jair Neves.
[6241.92 - 6245.92] P:1616.32 E:0.113372 |  Kvaratskjelja again has got Saliba all over him.
[6245.92 - 6247.92] P:1816.79 E:0.095029 |  The two of them fall off the pitch together.
[6247.92 - 6248.92] P:1876.72 E:0.101305 |  Calafiori it is.
[6248.92 - 6250.92] P:1835.11 E:0.099228 |  And actually, it's just a goal kick
[6250.92 - 6254.92] P:1805.33 E:0.100948 |  that's been given as they square up to one another.
[6254.92 - 6258.92] P:1921.90 E:0.112296 |  Calafiori and the assistant has actually come onto the field
[6258.92 - 6259.92] P:1926.75 E:0.102235 |  to stand between them.
[6259.92 - 6262.92] P:1864.75 E:0.097498 |  And it's a yellow card for Calafiori
[6262.92 - 6265.92] P:1851.49 E:0.095936 |  and also a yellow card for Kvaratskjelja.
[6265.92 - 6267.92] P:1732.19 E:0.081616 |  You can't square up in that fashion.
[6267.92 - 6270.92] P:1433.68 E:0.092486 |  I mean, the linesman is acting as a bouncer,
[6270.92 - 6272.92] P:1467.64 E:0.102617 |  trying to get his arm between him.
[6272.92 - 6274.92] P:1468.89 E:0.069681 |  He's that boxing referee.
[6274.92 - 6276.92] P:1559.83 E:0.100919 |  They really are squaring up
[6276.92 - 6279.92] P:1410.37 E:0.077603 |  and the referee comes over and gets the yellow card out
[6279.92 - 6283.92] P:1517.55 E:0.092467 |  for both players as it's just boiled over a little bit.
[6283.92 - 6288.92] P:1505.36 E:0.091246 |  Less than five minutes between Paris Saint-Germain
[6288.92 - 6291.92] P:1452.80 E:0.085481 |  and a second Champions League final.
[6291.92 - 6295.92] P:1572.99 E:0.097238 |  They reached that final, the Covid final in Lisbon against Bayern Munich,
[6295.92 - 6297.92] P:1601.66 E:0.096679 |  Hansi Flix Bayern Munich.
[6301.92 - 6305.92] P:1844.70 E:0.089491 |  There's a foul centre-field on Saka.
[6305.92 - 6307.92] P:1489.46 E:0.088069 |  I think it was dissent that from Saka.
[6307.92 - 6309.92] P:1592.11 E:0.091501 |  He felt that he was fouled and got up
[6309.92 - 6312.92] P:1514.61 E:0.091432 |  and he really let the referee have it.
[6313.92 - 6315.92] P:1619.09 E:0.087811 |  So frustration for Saka.
[6315.92 - 6318.92] P:1551.02 E:0.096488 |  He said something to the referee.
[6318.92 - 6323.92] P:1664.89 E:0.095500 |  So a free yellow card for Bukajosakar in a free kick.
[6323.92 - 6325.92] P:1717.32 E:0.099495 |  And Marquinhos down there, Marquinhos.
[6325.92 - 6330.92] P:1719.20 E:0.101930 |  They can see him saying to Patio and to Vettini.
[6330.92 - 6332.92] P:1740.18 E:0.100174 |  Just take as long as you can over this.
[6332.92 - 6335.92] P:1732.42 E:0.094294 |  More substitutes have been beckoned forward,
[6335.92 - 6337.92] P:1672.31 E:0.112823 |  called forward by Luis Enrique.
[6337.92 - 6340.92] P:1817.53 E:0.080284 |  Who is the champion of the final?
[6340.92 - 6343.92] P:1738.60 E:0.092600 |  Yes, it's Thomas Tuchel's PSG
[6343.92 - 6346.92] P:1552.52 E:0.104516 |  that lost in that Champions League final
[6346.92 - 6350.92] P:1538.64 E:0.097530 |  against Hansi Flix, Bayern Munich and Lisbon in 2020.
[6350.92 - 6353.92] P:1478.91 E:0.100749 |  They've had some of the managers who've come through
[6353.92 - 6355.92] P:1699.09 E:0.094156 |  and tried to do what Luis Enrique
[6355.92 - 6358.92] P:1546.01 E:0.087122 |  might be able to do next month.
[6358.92 - 6360.92] P:1554.02 E:0.092389 |  And Chalotti, Laurent Blanc was here for a long time.
[6360.92 - 6363.92] P:1634.71 E:0.096312 |  Unai Emery, of course, mentioned Thomas Tuchel
[6363.92 - 6366.92] P:1634.17 E:0.088311 |  who got to the final, Richard Pocciettino.
[6366.92 - 6370.92] P:1729.60 E:0.089445 |  And Christoph Gaultier was the most recent coach
[6370.92 - 6372.92] P:1787.89 E:0.098660 |  before Luis Enrique to Kovac.
[6372.92 - 6374.92] P:1655.05 E:0.107835 |  And it really looks as though Luis Enrique
[6374.92 - 6376.92] P:1751.72 E:0.083152 |  has got everything for this PSG,
[6376.92 - 6379.92] P:1621.96 E:0.086708 |  for this club pointing in the right direction.
[6379.92 - 6382.92] P:1633.60 E:0.095403 |  And it might well be enough to see them all the way
[6382.92 - 6384.92] P:1510.16 E:0.094915 |  to lifting the trophy, but as we know,
[6384.92 - 6387.92] P:1516.47 E:0.086378 |  Inter are going to be tough, tough opponents within Zaghi.
[6387.92 - 6389.92] P:1363.93 E:0.080266 |  Arsenal come forward again,
[6389.92 - 6392.92] P:1787.74 E:0.088006 |  needing two goals without reply.
[6392.92 - 6395.92] P:1906.72 E:0.100522 |  Just to take this to extra time.
[6395.92 - 6400.92] P:1813.70 E:0.090694 |  Consolo Ramos is going to be that substitute
[6400.92 - 6402.92] P:1757.34 E:0.110069 |  for Portuguese striker.
[6402.92 - 6405.92] P:2016.31 E:0.108101 |  15 goals from him this season.
[6405.92 - 6409.92] P:1716.92 E:0.102976 |  We saw him score against Manchester City, the clincher, didn't we?
[6409.92 - 6411.92] P:1799.34 E:0.114351 |  In the league stage, that important victory
[6411.92 - 6413.92] P:1885.11 E:0.100822 |  when they came from 2-0 down.
[6413.92 - 6415.92] P:1619.87 E:0.116061 |  That was when they were in danger of going out
[6415.92 - 6417.92] P:1722.11 E:0.095753 |  to the Champions League, remember, PSG?
[6417.92 - 6419.92] P:1584.21 E:0.080579 |  I mean, unbelievable. Was it 15?
[6419.92 - 6422.92] P:1607.89 E:0.092865 |  They finished in the league phase.
[6422.92 - 6426.92] P:1559.35 E:0.088834 |  To them being in this situation where your moments away
[6426.92 - 6428.92] P:1696.38 E:0.099066 |  from making the final just shows you
[6428.92 - 6431.92] P:1622.26 E:0.088210 |  the journey this team has been on this season.
[6431.92 - 6434.92] P:1594.81 E:0.090172 |  They're just a different team to what they were in October,
[6434.92 - 6437.92] P:1729.04 E:0.091005 |  November, and they're now a force to be reckoned with.
[6437.92 - 6440.92] P:1883.54 E:0.099786 |  Nuno Mendes is off, so Consolo Ramos is on.
[6440.92 - 6442.92] P:1799.08 E:0.098326 |  Long throw for Arsenal, again, party,
[6442.92 - 6444.92] P:1811.84 E:0.075234 |  but that's headed back out, and he gets that down.
[6444.92 - 6446.92] P:1782.10 E:0.090831 |  He has to cross in towards the back post.
[6446.92 - 6448.92] P:1812.13 E:0.094407 |  Ben White gets up with the header,
[6448.92 - 6450.92] P:1786.49 E:0.096778 |  but Lucas Hernandez did his job,
[6450.92 - 6452.92] P:1809.95 E:0.106286 |  there's high-fives all around,
[6452.92 - 6454.92] P:1700.82 E:0.108163 |  then White could only have it wide and behind,
[6454.92 - 6456.92] P:1695.52 E:0.117409 |  and it's a gold kick to PSG.
[6456.92 - 6458.92] P:1716.74 E:0.117683 |  And Pat Cho says to the PSG supporters,
[6458.92 - 6461.92] P:1721.16 E:0.104396 |  get on your feet, and they do.
[6461.92 - 6463.92] P:1828.11 E:0.117763 |  All around the stadium, the two tiers
[6463.92 - 6467.92] P:1674.92 E:0.099421 |  under this immense concrete roof above our heads.
[6467.92 - 6469.92] P:1716.87 E:0.088244 |  They're on their feet, they've got their red,
[6469.92 - 6471.92] P:1738.38 E:0.100116 |  blue and white scarves, they're twirling them,
[6471.92 - 6474.92] P:1562.94 E:0.102621 |  they're singing their Paris Saint-Germain songs,
[6474.92 - 6478.92] P:1702.83 E:0.091965 |  they're nearly there, just over a minute to play,
[6478.92 - 6481.92] P:1720.83 E:0.079824 |  just over a minute to go.
[6481.92 - 6484.92] P:1637.43 E:0.090659 |  Donnarumma, one of the men of the night,
[6484.92 - 6486.92] P:1750.63 E:0.084032 |  if not the man of the match.
[6486.92 - 6489.92] P:1663.34 E:0.074684 |  Donnarumma takes this gold kick,
[6489.92 - 6491.92] P:1708.24 E:0.091361 |  which comes off Consolo Ramos's head,
[6491.92 - 6493.92] P:1592.92 E:0.071270 |  now is out of play.
[6493.92 - 6496.92] P:1567.36 E:0.090491 |  Nicolette says, come on, let's get that ball back.
[6496.92 - 6498.92] P:1452.82 E:0.088725 |  They're not giving it up yet, of course.
[6498.92 - 6501.92] P:1697.63 E:0.093236 |  Need two goals without reply, just to take this to extra time.
[6501.92 - 6503.92] P:1666.34 E:0.088302 |  Urega jumps with Vittini,
[6503.92 - 6505.92] P:1739.60 E:0.101361 |  but it bounces down for Fabian Ruiz,
[6505.92 - 6507.92] P:1708.09 E:0.068986 |  he scored the opening goal tonight.
[6507.92 - 6510.92] P:1771.80 E:0.092312 |  Now, Cavarietta Caglia, carrying the ball out towards the right-hand side.
[6510.92 - 6512.92] P:1627.82 E:0.097471 |  I wouldn't be surprised that he just keeps going with it
[6512.92 - 6514.92] P:1635.11 E:0.094105 |  down that right wing, he does,
[6514.92 - 6516.92] P:1710.92 E:0.116812 |  Rice is there, Calafiore puts in the challenge,
[6516.92 - 6518.92] P:1769.74 E:0.110718 |  takes the ball away from...
[6518.92 - 6522.92] P:1800.09 E:0.115842 |  Cavarietta Caglia gets up and roars to the crowd
[6522.92 - 6524.92] P:1856.66 E:0.100003 |  to make some noise over in that section as well.
[6524.92 - 6528.92] P:1762.35 E:0.088216 |  Cavarietta Caglia signed from Napoli in January,
[6528.92 - 6531.92] P:1722.22 E:0.096988 |  who might well win the Italian League ahead of Inter
[6531.92 - 6534.92] P:1575.19 E:0.090534 |  by the time we get to the Champions League final.
[6534.92 - 6537.92] P:1520.29 E:0.099651 |  I wonder if that means that he'll get two League championships...
[6537.92 - 6540.92] P:1539.52 E:0.100063 |  ..winning medals this season.
[6540.92 - 6543.92] P:1729.57 E:0.087726 |  Five minutes of added time,
[6543.92 - 6547.92] P:1625.94 E:0.090059 |  time running out for Arsenal and for Michela Arteta.
[6549.92 - 6551.92] P:1690.92 E:0.112470 |  It would be some League season
[6551.92 - 6554.92] P:1808.10 E:0.086613 |  if you've got two championship-winning medals
[6554.92 - 6556.92] P:1499.88 E:0.088183 |  and the Champions League winning medals.
[6556.92 - 6558.92] P:1517.49 E:0.088667 |  France, Italy and the Champions League.
[6558.92 - 6560.92] P:1701.98 E:0.091864 |  That wouldn't be bad.
[6560.92 - 6563.92] P:1816.70 E:0.072441 |  And they've got to go off to the FIFA Club World Cup,
[6563.92 - 6566.92] P:1797.37 E:0.089442 |  and they've got to go off to the course as well.
[6566.92 - 6569.92] P:1625.97 E:0.088990 |  In the summer there, one of the teams that are in that,
[6569.92 - 6572.92] P:1620.19 E:0.099418 |  they're in a group with Atletico Madrid,
[6572.92 - 6575.92] P:1673.29 E:0.093744 |  Seattle Sanders and Botter Falgo.
[6575.92 - 6578.92] P:1537.49 E:0.081199 |  So we are into those five minutes of added time.
[6578.92 - 6584.92] P:1743.13 E:0.089928 |  And PSG, playing the ball back towards the edge of the area.
[6584.92 - 6586.92] P:1887.82 E:0.094241 |  Again, if you just switched on tonight,
[6586.92 - 6588.92] P:1633.78 E:0.082009 |  the first 20 minutes tonight of the second leg
[6588.92 - 6590.92] P:1606.08 E:0.085227 |  were absolutely crucial.
[6590.92 - 6592.92] P:1785.63 E:0.078345 |  Arsenal play were excellent in that spell,
[6592.92 - 6595.92] P:1729.53 E:0.084098 |  they couldn't get the goal, they couldn't find the goal
[6595.92 - 6597.92] P:1688.17 E:0.079862 |  to bring the tie back level.
[6597.92 - 6601.92] P:1810.76 E:0.092022 |  And Fabian Ruiz was able to sweep in a magnificent shot
[6601.92 - 6604.92] P:1854.42 E:0.090392 |  from the edge of the area to make it 1-0 on the night.
[6604.92 - 6606.92] P:1871.71 E:0.114775 |  That became 2-0 Hakimi's goal.
[6606.92 - 6608.92] P:1904.69 E:0.089821 |  Bukai Osaka got one back,
[6608.92 - 6612.92] P:1879.99 E:0.093071 |  but Arsenal now just minutes away from going out
[6612.92 - 6614.92] P:1867.18 E:0.108492 |  at the semi-final stage.
[6614.92 - 6616.92] P:1914.41 E:0.108045 |  It's a second semi-final defeat of the season
[6616.92 - 6618.92] P:1894.13 E:0.100460 |  after Newcastle in the Carabao Cup.
[6618.92 - 6620.92] P:1904.61 E:0.104855 |  Ben White now into the penalty area.
[6620.92 - 6623.92] P:1968.46 E:0.099157 |  Ben White's cross, Glantz by Marino,
[6623.92 - 6625.92] P:1823.26 E:0.104538 |  but wider the far post with his head.
[6625.92 - 6630.92] P:1785.43 E:0.092883 |  Ten yards out, behind, goal kick, PSG.
[6630.92 - 6632.92] P:1808.48 E:0.107876 |  And Arsenal's players out there, the body language,
[6632.92 - 6635.92] P:1891.19 E:0.103862 |  just tell you that they know the game is nearly up.
[6635.92 - 6637.92] P:1785.33 E:0.102382 |  Yeah, three players arriving in the box,
[6637.92 - 6640.92] P:1834.14 E:0.090414 |  because he checked onto his left foot there,
[6640.92 - 6643.92] P:1695.06 E:0.087319 |  Ben White, their momentum is then stationary
[6643.92 - 6646.92] P:1605.58 E:0.088598 |  when the ball comes in, and they can't get any power
[6646.92 - 6649.92] P:1716.39 E:0.107231 |  or purchase on the header to really trouble Donnarama
[6649.92 - 6652.92] P:1380.48 E:0.110369 |  and it ends up being a bit of a glancing flick from Marino.
[6652.92 - 6654.92] P:1525.45 E:0.111946 |  It goes harmlessly wide,
[6654.92 - 6657.92] P:1517.04 E:0.103880 |  and they just haven't quite made enough
[6657.92 - 6660.92] P:1421.59 E:0.120778 |  of those situations they've got in this evening, Arsenal,
[6660.92 - 6663.92] P:1449.44 E:0.111722 |  certainly around when this cross has come into the box.
[6663.92 - 6666.92] P:1564.22 E:0.112816 |  Five-life sport will be on air tonight.
[6666.92 - 6669.92] P:1548.92 E:0.110953 |  Until half-bast 10, we'll try and bring you some reaction
[6669.92 - 6675.92] P:1637.19 E:0.103170 |  from Nicola Teta before 10.30, if not, it'll be on the Champions League debrief
[6675.92 - 6677.92] P:1722.58 E:0.109453 |  on the football daily feed on BBC Sound.
[6677.92 - 6679.92] P:1678.81 E:0.092605 |  Here's Declan Rice.
[6679.92 - 6681.92] P:1624.23 E:0.107347 |  Declan Rice in comes the challenge on him from Patio,
[6681.92 - 6685.92] P:1706.41 E:0.091991 |  then back to party, Oregard on the right flank,
[6685.92 - 6686.92] P:1747.72 E:0.101884 |  down near the corner flag.
[6686.92 - 6688.92] P:1689.50 E:0.093769 |  Oregard back to Ben White, puts his foot on the ball,
[6688.92 - 6692.92] P:1765.28 E:0.091461 |  infield towards Thomas Party, then back towards Saliva.
[6692.92 - 6696.92] P:1781.38 E:0.090647 |  Oregard, Oregard away from Lucas Hernandez.
[6696.92 - 6699.92] P:1803.78 E:0.085421 |  And then Thomas Party, then to the edge of the area,
[6699.92 - 6703.92] P:1841.97 E:0.090109 |  Declan Rice, the man against Real Madrid.
[6703.92 - 6705.92] P:1864.13 E:0.102410 |  And here's Trossard now who finds some space,
[6705.92 - 6709.92] P:1791.56 E:0.099078 |  and Trossard shoots, puts that block inside the penalty area by Schuau Neves.
[6709.92 - 6713.92] P:1703.80 E:0.092980 |  And now it goes for a throw-in over on the left-hand side.
[6713.92 - 6720.92] P:1732.13 E:0.087982 |  That Arsenal will take with just over two minutes of added time to play.
[6720.92 - 6722.92] P:1762.21 E:0.089697 |  Arsenal have to score twice.
[6722.92 - 6725.92] P:1729.73 E:0.099573 |  Kibios now up there as well.
[6725.92 - 6727.92] P:1559.42 E:0.116699 |  Kibios won the throw-in over on the far side.
[6727.92 - 6730.92] P:1672.09 E:0.094895 |  A throw-in party to take this.
[6730.92 - 6732.92] P:1564.67 E:0.111398 |  Right up against the hoardings.
[6732.92 - 6734.92] P:1594.67 E:0.108535 |  Here's the long throw for Arsenal.
[6734.92 - 6736.92] P:1689.68 E:0.100477 |  Into the penalty area, a little flick.
[6736.92 - 6741.92] P:1764.97 E:0.094135 |  Then it's poked by Trossard, but it just ran away, dribbled away from him.
[6741.92 - 6747.92] P:1789.82 E:0.106350 |  And Donnaroma just follows the ball and then flops down on it.
[6747.92 - 6751.92] P:1702.55 E:0.098262 |  And then climbs to his feet.
[6751.92 - 6754.92] P:1694.44 E:0.099209 |  Marino turns away, frustratedly.
[6754.92 - 6757.92] P:1562.26 E:0.106223 |  And I'll make it, we've got 90 seconds left, Matt.
[6757.92 - 6761.92] P:1558.88 E:0.105021 |  Yeah, I think Thomas Party's arms might be a bit sore tomorrow
[6761.92 - 6765.92] P:1466.82 E:0.112195 |  from the amount of throw-ins that he's had to sling into the PSG box
[6765.92 - 6768.92] P:1657.90 E:0.092724 |  to try and cause a bit of chaos.
[6768.92 - 6773.92] P:1476.88 E:0.110260 |  It hasn't quite had the effect where anything has dropped bar
[6773.92 - 6777.92] P:1595.67 E:0.100459 |  in that opening 15 minutes, and you've already alluded to it, John.
[6777.92 - 6781.92] P:1432.25 E:0.102513 |  It was crucial that something landed for Arsenal in that period
[6781.92 - 6786.92] P:1525.00 E:0.082445 |  and it would have been possibly a different story.
[6786.92 - 6789.92] P:1616.89 E:0.093557 |  Yes, the high-high for Arsenal.
[6789.92 - 6792.92] P:1751.84 E:0.104649 |  It was the quarter-final against Real Madrid.
[6792.92 - 6796.92] P:1754.82 E:0.094254 |  They're going out to this excellent Paris Saint-Germain team
[6796.92 - 6798.92] P:1660.31 E:0.103291 |  that Louis-Enrique has moulded.
[6798.92 - 6804.92] P:1659.81 E:0.073053 |  This is second season, already French champions.
[6804.92 - 6807.92] P:1739.84 E:0.097858 |  And it looks as though in the next few seconds
[6807.92 - 6813.92] P:1683.65 E:0.098556 |  the whistle will go and send them to the Champions League final in Munich later this month.
[6813.92 - 6815.92] P:1611.51 E:0.100363 |  Donnaroma long and downfield.
[6815.92 - 6817.92] P:1586.81 E:0.105715 |  Raya's able to bring that down.
[6817.92 - 6820.92] P:1660.55 E:0.108543 |  2-1 on the night, 3-1 on aggregate.
[6820.92 - 6823.92] P:1602.03 E:0.111719 |  Saliba, perhaps the final attack.
[6823.92 - 6826.92] P:1733.73 E:0.100793 |  We're in the last 30 seconds now.
[6826.92 - 6828.92] P:1653.04 E:0.109888 |  Here's one for Saka to chase into the area.
[6828.92 - 6833.92] P:1751.80 E:0.112600 |  Saka across, but Marquinhos also is able to win the ball,
[6833.92 - 6836.92] P:1697.06 E:0.104917 |  win the race to it against Merino,
[6836.92 - 6839.92] P:1696.43 E:0.098560 |  and he plonks it out of play down in front of us,
[6839.92 - 6844.92] P:1778.71 E:0.095355 |  looking down the stand here in front of us, all of the PSG supporters.
[6844.92 - 6849.92] P:1737.46 E:0.099474 |  Thousands of them now, all around the Parc de France with their scarves in the air.
[6849.92 - 6851.92] P:1733.68 E:0.085537 |  They're nearly there.
[6851.92 - 6854.92] P:1813.68 E:0.104749 |  Arsenal heading out, Thomas Parti with the long-thrill.
[6854.92 - 6856.92] P:1771.09 E:0.097416 |  I think this will be the last action of the match.
[6856.92 - 6858.92] P:1701.75 E:0.087829 |  In comes the thrill.
[6858.92 - 6860.92] P:1707.21 E:0.117056 |  There's the clearance from Petitna.
[6860.92 - 6862.92] P:1747.21 E:0.114105 |  There's the final whistle.
[6862.92 - 6868.92] P:1728.77 E:0.109897 |  And Paris Saint-Germain have knocked out Arsenal in the semifinals.
[6868.92 - 6872.92] P:1669.79 E:0.107615 |  Paris Saint-Germain are going to Munich.
[6872.92 - 6874.92] P:1715.23 E:0.105539 |  Arsenal are out.
[6874.92 - 6879.92] P:1713.13 E:0.115079 |  These two clubs with their big dreams of winning the Champions League.
[6879.92 - 6882.92] P:1719.38 E:0.113473 |  Well, not this year for Michel Arteta and Arsenal.
[6882.92 - 6884.92] P:1688.96 E:0.109993 |  And Luis Enrique.
[6884.92 - 6888.92] P:1764.64 E:0.112886 |  Luis Enrique is surrounded by his coaching staff.
[6888.92 - 6892.92] P:1756.87 E:0.112058 |  Luis Enrique, already a Champions League winner with Barcelona.
[6892.92 - 6899.92] P:1763.88 E:0.104624 |  Now he'll try and do what so many before him have failed to do with Paris Saint-Germain.
[6899.92 - 6910.92] P:1790.70 E:0.089877 |  He's got Inter and Filippo and Zaghi to get past in three weeks' time in the final.
[6910.92 - 6912.92] P:1766.74 E:0.098342 |  What a final that should be.
[6912.92 - 6919.92] P:1802.70 E:0.100845 |  But Arsenal players standing with hands on hips, looking at the turf just like 16 years ago.
[6919.92 - 6924.92] P:1812.12 E:0.100945 |  Last time they were in a Champions League semi-final, it's ended in defeat.
[6924.92 - 6927.92] P:1845.63 E:0.099575 |  Two-one on the night, three-one on aggregate.
[6927.92 - 6930.92] P:1697.80 E:0.103926 |  Yeah, difficult to take for Arsenal.
[6930.92 - 6937.92] P:1790.34 E:0.099942 |  Another semi-final that they end up losing is becoming a little bit of a habit, which isn't great.
[6937.92 - 6945.92] P:1760.84 E:0.098379 |  But what I will say, John, is I think that you have to look at the performance and the way that Arsenal approached this game.
[6945.92 - 6948.92] P:1754.24 E:0.103751 |  And there's a lot of positives about how they went about it.
[6948.92 - 6950.92] P:1737.93 E:0.086161 |  They didn't get the desired result.
[6950.92 - 6958.92] P:1726.58 E:0.101492 |  Donnarama pulled brilliant saves at key moments where they really needed to score a goal.
[6958.92 - 6960.92] P:1719.48 E:0.087859 |  And it just didn't happen for them in this game.
[6960.92 - 6969.92] P:1719.84 E:0.095081 |  But PSG, for me, of all the Champions League teams I've seen this season, they're in a special moment here at this club.
[6969.92 - 6974.92] P:1794.45 E:0.099081 |  And I think there's a real feeling for me that this is going to be their time.
[6974.92 - 6978.92] P:1837.79 E:0.104008 |  Yep, much more on that very subject, I'm sure, after 10 o'clock.
[6978.92 - 6982.92] P:1776.25 E:0.096909 |  But we've got wild scenes of celebration here at the end of a semi-final.
[6982.92 - 6987.92] P:1773.20 E:0.104512 |  It's so tough for the losers, Arsenal's players going across to their fans in the corner.
[6987.92 - 6994.92] P:1773.62 E:0.098634 |  And that PSG theme go west, blaring out inside the stadium.
[6994.92 - 6998.92] P:1794.61 E:0.091645 |  The Arsenal song, but it's Paris Saint-Germain's night.
[6998.92 - 7001.92] P:1828.39 E:0.100050 |  Two-one on the night, three-one on aggregate.
[7001.92 - 7003.92] P:1791.15 E:0.091718 |  Paris Saint-Germain are in the final.
[7004.92 - 7010.92] P:1687.49 E:0.092697 |  Mickaël Arteta going round the Paris Saint-Germain players and shaking them by their hands.
[7010.92 - 7014.92] P:1754.16 E:0.090967 |  Of course, Mickaël Arteta, a man who has played for Paris Saint-Germain as well.
[7014.92 - 7021.92] P:1674.65 E:0.083556 |  So he's shaking the hands of some of the Paris Saint-Germain staff in Dignitaries who were on the pitch as well.
[7021.92 - 7024.92] P:1713.65 E:0.096808 |  And they are celebrating as a group, aren't they, John?
[7024.92 - 7031.92] P:1739.20 E:0.082962 |  That Paris Saint-Germain squad, backroom staff, they're in a circle and dancing together at the moment.
[7031.92 - 7033.92] P:1733.45 E:0.073494 |  And that's exactly it.
[7033.92 - 7039.92] P:1811.04 E:0.099140 |  And we've said this time and again about this Paris Saint-Germain squad, this team at the moment under Louis Enrique.
[7039.92 - 7043.92] P:1790.70 E:0.102731 |  The big difference is that's exactly what they are. They're all celebrating together there.
[7043.92 - 7047.92] P:1718.55 E:0.101327 |  They are a unit, they're a team, and that's often been the downfall in the past.
[7047.92 - 7052.92] P:1732.25 E:0.090662 |  But this is different PSG and this might be the year for them.
[7052.92 - 7056.92] P:1487.03 E:0.102397 |  And you describe them as being in a moment, Matt.
[7056.92 - 7062.92] P:1691.18 E:0.100868 |  And look, well, back on the game after 10 o'clock, we'll certainly look at it from an Arsenal point of view as well.
[7062.92 - 7074.92] P:1804.07 E:0.086042 |  But they are in a moment at Paris Saint-Germain and they are enjoyable to watch for all sorts of different reasons.
[7074.92 - 7078.92] P:1750.96 E:0.100127 |  Yeah, I completely agree, Chappers, that they're an outstanding team to watch.
[7078.92 - 7085.92] P:1574.95 E:0.102566 |  I will say there's so many interesting things about them, but the one thing that stands out the most for me
[7085.92 - 7090.92] P:1549.01 E:0.103909 |  is that Louis Enrique has got a team that works incredibly hard for each other.
[7090.92 - 7098.92] P:1595.20 E:0.099588 |  And they've got an energy level and a speed about them, certainly in wide areas, that is just so hard to handle.
[7098.92 - 7106.92] P:1666.65 E:0.091710 |  And they put it all together, I think they're demanding a lot from each other, and they've grown so quickly as a team together
[7106.92 - 7111.92] P:1782.93 E:0.098659 |  that it's just really, you know, they're night and day for what they were at the start of the season.
[7111.92 - 7121.92] P:1797.98 E:0.096816 |  I think they... Yeah, it's baffling. I think we've struggled to find five positives about them, say, in October, to be honest with you.
[7121.92 - 7127.92] P:1774.52 E:0.096385 |  But then, since then, they have pace, they have energy, they have stamina, they put their bodies on the line,
[7127.92 - 7132.92] P:1649.80 E:0.107227 |  they've got some of the most skillful players in Europe, they've got some of the youngest players in Europe,
[7132.92 - 7140.92] P:1723.87 E:0.097554 |  they have a goalkeeper who divides opinion but seems to make four world-class saves in every Champions League knockout tie that he's in.
[7140.92 - 7143.92] P:1913.79 E:0.098517 |  Seems to be man of the match in virtually every Champions League.
[7143.92 - 7152.92] P:1783.96 E:0.095526 |  Yeah, and yet people question, I mean, the contrast from October to now is, I mean, it's not much of a different clock.
[7152.92 - 7160.92] P:1860.09 E:0.106399 |  They're actually now going, Mark, the PSG squad altogether, they've gone to the other end, which is to our left, that's where the all the Ultras are.
[7160.92 - 7169.92] P:1852.14 E:0.098159 |  There's no one's left there, and there are dozens of red flares burning away in the top tier, and they're all together celebrating,
[7169.92 - 7172.92] P:1730.25 E:0.098402 |  hand in hand, running towards those supporters.
[7172.92 - 7182.92] P:1808.47 E:0.094824 |  There are probably about 200 photographers as well behind the goal in the area between the goal and the pitch and the stand,
[7182.92 - 7186.92] P:1901.84 E:0.076927 |  and the flag still waving, what a sight it is.
[7186.92 - 7196.92] P:1696.42 E:0.085222 |  I think also, Chappers, touching on that speed of how quickly they've kind of transformed into this Champions League finalist team,
[7196.92 - 7205.92] P:1599.00 E:0.085726 |  you have to look at the manager, don't you? And you have to think, wow, the messages that he must have got across in such a short period of time,
[7205.92 - 7210.92] P:1592.91 E:0.089562 |  credit to him because he's influenced this group of players massively.
[7210.92 - 7217.92] P:1629.98 E:0.099410 |  Lots to talk about ahead of the Champions League final. It's going to be Luis Enrique and Simone Insargi, Paris, Ajaman against Inter,
