 Well, thanks Mark, the England team and the Columbia team are now marching together out of the tunnel. The knockout stage of this World Cup is about to arrive for England and for Columbia. And they've arrived in Moscow, the England team on what is a cloudy evening. It might rain, it's quite cool as well. I would think that that would be good for the England team at this terrific stadium, the home of Spartak Moscow, which has the huge statue of Spartakus, the gladiator, standing on its pyramid plinth outside and the stadium with a red and white Spartak Moscow shell around it, inside 44,000 people and they are on their feet now as we wait for the anthems. But first of all, it will be the stirring anthem of Columbia. So Harry Kane turns to his right and leads his England team along the line and clasps hands with those 11 Colombians in the yellow shirts. England against Columbia, a country that has never recorded a victory over England in five previous meetings. The might, if you're old enough, remember the game at France 98, their only previous meeting at a World Cup finals tournament when England won by two goals to nil. Gareth Southgate was among the unused substitutes that day. But that's all history, Chris Waddle. What Columbia are here in Russia is one of the group winners and the group winners are tending the goal through. So far six of the seven group winners are into the last date, the exceptions being Russia, who was renault because we sat and watched it. They shouldn't have got through. So yeah, there's a partner there, isn't there, where all the group leaders are going through. But you've got to say England should be very confident coming out. I know the rest of the players against Belgium and obviously lost one nil. But listen, we don't know which club in say is going to turn up. So I don't think England's got really anything to fear here. The two number nine are shaking hands, the two captains, Harry Kane and Radamel Falcao, who we know very well, now posing with the American officials, referee Mark Geiger. Chris Waddle sitting alongside me here, Chris, who won 62 caps for England in the commentary position, which is very low down actually in the Spartak Stadium, but will also be able to bring in Terry Butcher, the captain last time England reached the World Cup semi-final, who's standing behind the advertising hoardings at one end at pitch level. So Terry, just give us a thought from you before this game begins. Well, I'm actually sitting down, I've got a stool here, it feels like I'm fishing in the canals. But I'm just peering over the top of the advertising boards of pitch is magnificent, really looking forward to a great atmosphere. England want to try and silence this crowd because obviously the majority are Colombian supporters, but England look sharp, bright red kit, look fantastic. Here we go, looking forward to it. So Terry Butcher and Chris Waddle, Reathers inside the stadium on five live, Colombia against England in the last 16 at this 2018 World Cup. Colombia with a Spina in goal, the Arsenal goalkeeper back for of Arias, Yerimina of Barcelona, Gavinson Sanchez of Tottenham, Johan Mojica is the left back, three central midfielders, Carlos Sanchez, the former Aston Dillaman who was sent off in the first match, Jefferson Lerma and Wilmar Barrios, and then one quadrado, one Quintero and Radomal Falcao up front. And England, same team that played against Tunisia at the start of this World Cup. Jordan Pickford in goal, Walker Stones in Maguire, Trippier and Young, Henderson, Lingard, Dali Alley, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. The atmosphere, wonderful. It's a Colombian atmosphere, it must be said. Flags of yellow, blue and red waving all around the stadium. The England flags, the Cross of St George flags are all, well mainly in the end, to our right. And in the first half we'll play from right to left in the all red kit tonight with the white trim. But it's Colombia in the yellow shirts, the white shorts and the white socks who get the game underway in the last 16 at this World Cup tournament, this wide open half of the draw. And immediately Arias pushing up the right hand side, which is very much his way, the right back, England get their first touch as Jellie Alley and then Harry Kane deflected out of play for a throwing to Colombia, any other halfway line. But the number four Arias will take back into central defence where he finds Big Yeri Mina, who moved to Barcelona in January and has yet to settle there but has been quite a presence in this Colombian side so far and has obviously scored two goals from set pieces. To his left the Tottenham man, Davinson Sanchez, who receives the ball now in his white boots and then plays it out to the left hand side to Johan Mojica, who plays for Girona in Spain. That's their back four. Long ball hit up towards Falcao who comes short for it. The ball whizzes over his head and Jordan Pickford gets his first touch of the match. So Colombia nil, England nil, good to have you with us on Five Live, BBC Five Live following England at this World Cup 2018. You can listen via the BBC Sport app as well. The BBC World Service across Africa are listening in as well, good to have you with us as well as TSN in Canada too. So hello to you all wherever you are. He has young, playing the ball back for England into his own half and then Maguire going all the way back to Jordan Pickford. Coruza booze and whistles from the Colombian fans. I just strange I have set up with Falcao, Pordrudo on the right, what we thought, but you've got, you've got, Quintero was actually playing as a 10, yeah, Falcao. So he left back to being isolated and, hey, Q and Chip, they should get them, especially Co-Water should be getting a lot of the balls. Nobody on that side. Raheem Sterling, 999 days since he last scored for England. He's the first to run forward, then receives it again, but a strong challenge from Mojica comes in on him and Colombia are back in possession inside their own half. And in fact, Quintero does well, little Quintero holds it up against Henderson, then plays at Darius on the right-hand side here. Cuadrado, Juventus makes a run out to the right-hand side, but it comes in field to Quintero who of course is having a very good World Cup. This, this Porto man who has had, as Tim Vickery was suggesting, as the cross comes in from Mojica on the left-hand side, but is easily headed away for England. And England take possession. Kyle Walker, very cool from Walker to beat Quintero. And England are looking to pass it out from the back. Yeah, Quintero, whose parent club is Porto, but as Tim Vickery was suggesting, has had various lifestyle issues and has ended up in Argentina on loan at Boca Juniors, but has done well there and therefore has got his international recall. He has Harry Kane winning a free kick, I'm taking it quickly. Out to the right-hand side, Trippia arrives. Trippia with a little ball down the right towards Lingard. But Davinson Sanchez allows it to run, but it won't run out of play, so he has to take the ball and clear it away. And he, as he was doing so, he was fell by Lingard and it's a free kick to Columbia in the left-back position. So Nil Nil, very early stage, is three minutes played. Actually, Barrios has dropped sort of right in front of 2.5, so they've really packed them in midfield. And the two full-backs are actually playing like wing-backs and sort of 2.5 and Barrios just keeps dropping in to make it three, but he's sort of playing ten yards in front of the midtimes. Barrios, who plays with Boca Juniors in Argentina, can clear a river plate, that's where he's been on loan, free kick to be taken by Ospina. They are Snow Goalkeeper, who has committed the odd mistake and error during the course of this qualifying campaign, and indeed in some of the warm-up matches as well, where he looked rather shaky in the match against France, but it's worth pointing out that this Columbia team did beat France 3-2 in March. England with possession. Henderson goes all the way back to Pitt for the game. And this is a composed start from England. Not the quick start yet that Garry Southgate wanted to see. Pitt out to McGuire, McGuire then. Kane has come very deep and actually Barrios went all the way with Harry Kane, deep into his own territory. Deli Ali now on the left-hand side, just in front of us. Sterling with a run down the left-hand side and the defender, Nina, slides in in the full-back position and takes it with his arm. It goes behind for what would have been a corner, but in fact it was handball, so it's a free kick, Chris. Well, so far England has been very, very good at set pieces and this is a great position, isn't it? Well, it's five yards off the bi-lane, just outside the 18-yard box on this left-hand side. And we've got a lot of options here. Will he shoot at the cross the goal? Ashley Young is the only contender to take it. Trippias are in right away over to the far side. Walker and Lingard are outside the box, but the big presence of Harry McGuire has been the obvious target for England set pieces. Will they work one in the training here where somebody spins around the back or gets across the near post and they only need a flick of the paces on the cross. It's Nail Nail, five-live, free kick, first big chance at this round of 16 match. Young's still waiting. There's lots of movement in the box. Referee Geiger just keeping an eye on it. It's swung in by Young and then punched away by goalkeeper Ross Spina where it was right under his nose, but it's come out for Trippias who swells it in. And it takes a flick off a Colombian head and bounces out of play just next to the corner flag for an England corner. The first corner, Ashley Young's going to come across and keep an eye on McGuire and Stones here. They're saying they're getting obviously as we've saw cuddled as they describe it now. Every set piece, but we'll see here. But normally they just hang this up to the penalty spot and let them not attack it. The referee is very close now to a huddle of players, four England men, four Colombians. Young to take the corner, drives it in towards the back post. Ross Spina catches it. Harry Kane, meanwhile, was in a heap with Carlos Sanchez on the edge of the penalty area, but they're breaking downfield with left back Mohica who shows far too much of that. And England come bursting forward with Trippia down the right hand side and then the ball is deflected out of play by Sanchez for what is a throw in on the far side. Yeah, I think England has started pretty bright. They've just got to settle down in possession now. At the tempo they've got to winning the ball back and the energy so far. But when they get the ball, they've got to relax. You know, there's two buttons A and B. Go and get it back, press A. When you get it, relax, press B. In a minute, then up, press B. That's Chris Waddle. Get a word from Terry Butcher behind one of the goals. When we get an opportunity, I just noticed down to our left, Hamas Rodriguez, who's not involved. His injury, his calf injury has kept him out and he's just been guided to a seat in the stands. Nowhere near the bench actually. Chris Waddle over to our left hand side, closer to the corner flag. Brilliant commentary position we have here. Most of this will come, we've been up in the heavens, but now we're down at a low level. England get this free kick, which is played into the penalty area on the right. Sterling's after it and there's a deflection behind for another corner to England. Good free kick again. Just didn't plant it in the box. Little bit of movement, trying to get Sterling in down the side. Good defend and two yellow shirts, getting out for another corner. Tall England. So much talk about set pieces, defending of set pieces. Referee Geiger is speaking to Carlos Sanchez, who is the man who has been assigned Harry Kane. And as I mentioned, the last corner, they both ended up on the ground. Kane now, referee says stop, stop, don't take the corner. Trapia? They're not listening, they'll still do it. What? They'll still do it. Stones is there as well, just next to Harry Kane. And Trapia still waiting. Corner for England from the right, it's nil nil on five live. And here is the delivery from Trapia towards the penalty spot, which is headed away. And it actually might be run away for Colombia, as it's played for down the right-hand side by Quintero. England have been able to get back in good numbers. Arias, the right back, gets it back from Quintero. It was those two who brought very effectively together. Quintero's slimy, there was a hand ball there against Lingard. Referee Geiger ignores that and the ball runs out of play of Nina for a throw in two England just down in front of it. It was really a terrific tempo about the game now, wasn't it? The first couple of minutes, they saw a look at each other and dropped off. And so you can have it for a few seconds, but now it's come to life. Quadrado with a touch in the centre circle and then the ball finds the three of it out of the far side to Mohica. Colombia nil, England nil. And England having had a series of set pieces, free kick. Corners not able to force a save out of Ospina, just had to take a couple of catches. He has Arias again on the right-hand side, very highly rated. He's just won the league with PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands. The number four, the right back, might well be on the move during the course of this summer, possibly to the Premier League. The ball's been won back by Trippier and it's bounced to Harry Kane. Trippier was held back there, but Kane takes it on through the middle, but then gives it back to Lingard. One-two, Lingard with Sterling. Still the orange boots of Lingard in possession. And then a pass to Jung. Jung goes past Arias. Jung now, Sterling tried to give it back to Jung in the area, but it was blocked towards the dead ball line. And I'm not sure that Barrios kept that in. He didn't, it's corner. Yeah, it's another corner to England. We've seen the benefit of it. Rebler at first, I thought he did, but I thought he did as well there with the replay shows he did there. Once we get a moment, we will have a word from Terry Butcher, who is watching from ground level. But Jung with this corner, the referee's got his hands full here. Henderson makes a little run. Jung still waits. Kane and Maguire at the back post, as a Colombian gone down, and that's given us a free kick against John Stokes. They're clever. They're clever how they make it the other way, don't they? They go down first and they're saying, we're not doing anything. They are, they're holding them. Instead he's got his hands full. I think the Colombians have as well, but they can just say there, look, if John Stokes does push it away, obviously he falls to the floor, very dramatically, gets the free kick. Ten minutes played, Colombia, Neil England, Nell, whatever you made of the start, Terry Butcher down at pitch level. Whereas Fars is right down the other end to me, I can't see much, I need binoculars, but I'll tell you what, when England get the ball, a mootable quickly up to Sterling. Sterling's one-on-one against the big boy, Mina. Hight disadvantage, of course, but more of an advantage on the floor. Get the ball to Sterling a lot quicker. You've got a free kick just outside the box, didn't you? If England can get the ball to Sterling, one-on-one against Mina, that's where they'll get in. Thanks, Terry. Here in Trippia, wins the header, which is deflected out of play near the halfway line on the far side of the field. Two tears all the way around. Hospitality boxers dotted around the central section. Diego Maradona is one of those. He's been invited by FIFA this evening. As a special guest, Sosman Pablo Angel, by the way, as well as a Colombian guest. Another Colombian we know well from the Premier League, and the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, is here as well. Here is John Stones with the ball halfway inside his own heart. Stones score with two goals, his first two for England against Panama. The last time most of these players played, nine days ago. That wasn't the case with Colombia, who had to win and did and won the group. And Raheem Sterling, well, Mina is all over him. And he must be for talking chocolate bars. He's a full selection box taller than Raheem Sterling. And he was all over the back of him. That was a little bit like it's a knockout in it, when you get the big jump on the little thing, trying to ride it away. I saw you with your little Russian dolls, by the way. The video on social media. Very good. Raheem Sterling was one of... Was he the last one? Was it him or Kieran Trippier? Was it the little one? You can see that on the Five Lives social media feed. Free kick, forward of the centre circle for England. Trippier and Jung. It's going to be Trippier who's going to lift it in. But this is a major feature of this match so far. The tangling between defenders and England forwards. Here's the delivery from Trippier, but it's headed away. And there's a flick from Quintero. Fadrado had to make room behind himself. And then plays it back to Sanchez, who hits it long downfield. Jung with a header. Oh, that's missed it. An air kick. Sterling edge of the area. Opens up. He shoots straight into the back of Davinson Sanchez. Now, Deli Ali is beaten to a bouncing ball. Trippier, though, takes it on past Mohica. Could be something for England down the right-hand side. Mohica, the number 17 has got back into position, though, and has taken the ball away from Trippier. And then it's played forward by Davinson. Sanchez, nil nil. It's all England, John. And you can see the game planned from... Clumbier is just basically frustrated, frustrated. Hope England tear out, then they can get up the field themselves and maybe put some footballer there. But it's all England and Clumbier just stopping them playing. Their coach, Jose Peckerman, is watching on. And he's 68 years old. He's got so very hair. He's got rather a ghostly look to him, I always think. But he has reached the World Cup quarter-finals twice as a coach with Argentina, his native Argentina, and also with Columbia four years ago. The first time that Columbia have reached the last aid of the World Cup, and they're looking to match that here, but it's nil nil. Ball out towards the left-hand side. Here is Mohica again. Two England players with it. Deli Ali and Trippier. Mohica takes it on down the left, and then Trippier puts in a very strong challenge to take the ball. And a bit of the man. It's a throwing. Only played it back off Mohica, and a throwing to England in their right back position. I think that's the weakness of the back four, Mohica for me. I think if you can get still in, I know he's playing more of a centre forward at the minute. He's getting crowded out. A lot of change. He picks the ball up. Well, I think you get a lot of joy if you went and stood out there. He was at Real Balacarno, Johan Mohica, moved to Girona, and has now signed permanently. And he is operating. There's an awful lot being asked of him, has left back and also has an attacking force down the left-hand side. Throwing taken up towards Harry Kane, but it bounces off the England captain. And out of play for a throw in the other halfway line to Colombia. That Mohica will take. Brilliant atmosphere. You can hear the drums. I presume that's the England band. Yeah. But I wouldn't be surprised at all if there was a Colombian band. And it's a feature as well, with notice, the South Americans. Many of them have actually come as families with little children all the way from South America to Russia. Here's Ospina. High pass out towards this side, the Colombian right, and Arias cangles with Jung. The ball of age, both of them, and it's out of play for a throw in to England. Arias is complaining that Jung's challenge should have been given as a free kick. I think a lot of people were surprised at the selection of the referee. Mark Geiger. From the United States. Here's Trippier, who plays it down the right flank. And this time, Lingard catches up with it. Lingard. Lingard up against Jefferson Lermer. And then the overlapping run, it's one to the back post! And a hanging header from Harry Kane. Lands on the roof of the net. What a great move. Trippie, really, really gets great control of the ball. Perfectly tamed Brun. Oh, and Harry Kane just can't get above it. He had it down. He heads that down trip. Wonderful across the far post. Harry Kane's always reaching, but if he could just head it down, that's wonderful. It goes over, lands on the roof of the net. Kane was beyond the far post. The cross was ripped by Trippier. And Kane threw himself at it. And ended up diving off the pitch a little bit like Trevor Francis, when he scored the European final goal against Malmo, but he couldn't direct it into the roof of the net and it landed on the top. And he's got a couple eyes of a join this so far. They're dominating the game. They've got to put the ball in the net, because they will, Ty Ali always do. We know that. And you don't want Columbia coming out second half, dominating the play. And we can see, can't we, that Quintero and Cuadrado, and potentially Falco, could potentially carry danger when Columbia break forwards on the counterattack. Espina, the Arsenal goalkeeper, 29 years old, clears it up towards the half-way line. Maguire wins ahead at, and now in centrefield, it's played back to the number five, Wilmar Barrios, who's one of the two players that came into the Columbia side, Loma as well, in midfield, central midfield, Nohames Rodriguez, not on the bench either, injured at Kaft Problem. And England playing the same team, if you just switched on, if you've got back into your car on the way home, England the same team that played against Tunisia in the first match of this World Cup. These two tonight playing for a place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup, where they would play Sweden on Saturday in Samara. Here is Carlos Sanchez, sent off in the third minute of the first match. Plays the ball back towards the half-way line, and Columbia with a little spell of possession for themselves. After good England pressure, won four corners, Harry Kane has had that header, and here they come now with Cuadrado of Juventus. Contaro moves in field, Deli Alidore has gone with him, and staying very tight. Little Contaro, who can only be 5'6", 5'8". Very good player. Swings the ball out towards the left-hand side, and now Columbia start again with Jefferson Loma, and now stepping forward from the back, Big Yeri Mina, Contaro on the right-hand side. A left-footer ball over the top, but that will bounce harmlessly through to Pickford, from an England point of view. Did anyone pick the ball at Quintero? Valves Falco or Cuadrado? I've just made runs, because he's got that much ability in that left-foot. Already in the game, he's been their best player by far. He sees a pass, he needs movement. Cal Warg has tripped over, as he runs the ball away from the penalty area, free kick, which England take quickly. Here's one up towards Harry Kane, Nina has gone with him. Kane actually moves into his own half before he plays it back towards John Stones. Return pass from Jordan Henderson. Stones now a little bolder, Sterling, Sterling squared towards Kane. Now Dali Ali gets involved as well. England playing from right to left, the score is nil-nil, and John Stones whistles from all of these Colombian supporters in the stadium here in Moscow, because England are intersession. Harry Maguire up towards Kane. Once again, Barrios this time, is extremely tight on Harry Kane. They are very, very aware of the Kane danger. Kane then spins a pass out towards the right-hand side. Goodness, he struck that well. Trippie now with the ball at his feet. Trippie looking for support, and Mojica puts in the challenge for a huge cheer from the Colombian fans, but all he can do is pass it straight out of play for a throw. Nil-nil. So far, I think the teams are playing into the Colombian's hands, going in the middle all the time. They've got a lot of yellow shirts in the middle of the park, hand in front, the centre-halves. I think they're going to get more joy as we saw Trippie put a cross in from the ball in on the right. When he does, she only gets further forward and wider. Nil-nil, almost 20 minutes played. As I said, these England players, most of them, nine changes from the Belgium game, only Tickford and Stones are the two to keep the places, and they've started all of the matches at this World Cup so far, whereas Colombia had to win their second-two group matches against Poland, which they did very well, 3-0, remember, and 1-0 against Sanagall to win the group. He has Jali Ali on the left-hand side. Ali does well, holds off two men. Sterling then into the area, but Barrios went with him, and Sterling, as he looked to poke it across, missed it, and it rolled behind for a goal kick. He's getting some good areas there, Sterling, but he's just touched his deserved rims tonight, isn't it? It's a one-shot block, but he's got to look after the ball a lot better. He tried to check it back, and missed it, at the same time also. I mean, Barrios was certainly touched tight. He had his hands on his chest, but Sterling had already lost the ball over the dead ball line. Colombia nail England nil, so we've played 20 minutes. England have had the better of it. England had a number of set pieces. They're all still waiting for the first goal of this last 16 match. Sweden winning 1-0 against Switzerland up in St Petersburg, and our first commentary match of the day. In football, at least, we've had a number of tennis commentary matches for you. Wimbledon coverage will continue tomorrow at 11 o'clock on Five Live Sports Extra. The ball played up towards Harry Kane near the edge of the box. Davinson Sanchez wins it against his club mate, the two Tottenham men. And Cuadrado now has the ball for Colombia here on the right-hand side, and makes good ground down the right. Deli Ali has tracked his run. Arias is there as well. Quintero, who's played mainly on the right-ish side. Yellow shirt outside his white shorts. Then begins to weave back towards the right. Cuadrado makes himself available. Mohica is there out on the far side, but Cuadrado keeps it centrally and goes back towards the halfway line to Davinson Sanchez. The little number five, Barrios, now pulls the pass here to the right-hand side, to Carlos Sanchez. Sanchez goes for a quick ball towards Valcao, centrally just outside the D. And then a touch from Cuadrado. Cuadrado hits a shot, it deflects to Valcao, but Valcao couldn't get the ball under control, and it's stabbed away by Maguire. Only to Mohica, who hits an awful shot, which flies away not far away from where Terry Butcher is sitting behind the goal. So give us another thought, Terry. Well, it missed me by a mile, John, so I'm pretty safe here, but... Cuadrado is the one for me on the right-hand side, coming in, he's in between. Howie Maguire doesn't know if he can go down to him, John Stone doesn't know, but as Valco came short and got the ball, John Stone's got to concentrate a little bit more and make sure that they pick up these runs before they make any danger. But so Cuadrado is the one, if you allow him to get on the ball, he's very dangerous, puts a sporadic attack from Columbia in dominating so far. But as Chris says, haven't made it count. John Stone's is in possession, he has his back to Terry. We're looking across at him, slightly left of the halfway lane, but we really feel where we're sitting here, part of the atmosphere inside this stadium this evening. Here is Deli Alley now, through the middle. Ashley Young, Ashley Young has Arias snapping away at him, and Arias got a touch and that's carried it to Quintero. Quintero slips it through the legs of Harry Maguire and now Cuadrado is looking for Valco and Walker was able to adjust and play it away to Kieran Trippier. Just a couple of instances, the last two Colombian attacks, where England have just been stretched a little as Columbia come forward and now they've got a point on the far side for them. They're not a bad say, we're not saying that England should just be dominating the game. We'll say, you've got to be away, Cuadrado, especially for me, as I've said earlier, real talent. Yeah, Quintero, centrally at the moment. The ball's back on the halfway lane with Cuadrado. He's got some movement in this system that Peckerman is playing tonight. Lots of movement and now Lerner, high pass towards the right flank, but Ashley Young wins it in the air. That's already a very good contest, Arias against Young on this side of the field. Arias now, Quintero cuts it back and beats Deli Ali and then slips the ball through to Arias in the box, but Harry Maguire glides across and is able to take the ball away and play it towards the halfway line. Yeah, Columbia having a good spell here, a good five minutes in England. For the first time in the game, they're having to accept that Columbia have possession and they're having to play the game in their own half, while Columbia have the ball, Cuadrado on the right-hand side. Cuadrado then goes back to Nina and then Barrios with the ball through the middle towards Carlos Sanchez. And notice that Peckerman, the coach, dedicated their win over Poland to Carlos Sanchez, who was suspended for that match. Well, there's a poor pass from Lerner, which sails over the head of Cuadrado, who gives Lerner quite a glare on the balls out of play for a throw in to England. So it's Columbia nil, England nil. England also playing tonight back home with Old Trafford in the 2020. England are batting and we have commentary on that over on Five Live Sports Extra. Jimmy Anderson's part of the team again on BBC Radio. So you can listen to that Five Live Sports Extra online, also via the BBC Sport app. And obviously we'll keep you across the score here on Five Live as well. Harry Kane goes for an aerial ball with Nina, and then it's swept away by Davenson Sanchez. But only back to the red shirts of England, and not much in that from Carlos Sanchez on Delhi Ali. Down he went though, Delhi Ali won the free kick. Yeah, they give silly free kicks away. Sometimes it's too easy to win the ball back to Columbia, but the game's sort of leveled off now. We're coming over 25 minutes. England started very bravely, used a lot of energy, they've just slightly come off the pace, but again they've got to set pace here, and we know how threatening they are. Columbia nil, England nil. Young and Lingard over the free kick. It's about four strides in from the nearest touch line to us, just down in front of us, Ashleigh Young. And again the earlier theme now is back with us, as Ashleigh Young drives it in towards the back post, looking for Maguire. He did get his head to it, but it touched the head of Davenson Sanchez as well, and that's taken it behind for an England corner. There was Maguire the target. Yeah, it's worked well for them in this World Cup so far. He gets away, he gets half a yard. There's a collision. Davenson Sanchez is incredibly... He gets just in time. He did well, Sanchez there, Davenson Sanchez. So it's a corner, trippy had to take this one, pushing and shoving. I mean, the referee's standing right next to it. He could almost reach out and touch them. And... It's... He used to say things like this is like an NFL game. It's Lerma, who's in the middle of it, in between Maguire and Stones... Right. It's... It's a seven-game like this. So it is an England corner. Lots of movement, Stones now trying to find some space. Maguire as well. He has trippier with the delivery, and it's headed away by Mina, who got up and won that in no uncertain terms. And now Kyle Walker has to be quick, but of course we know that he is, and Walker gets there ahead of Arias on the halfway line to steer it all the way back to Pickford. I mentioned I'd update you on the England score. England 159 for eight in their 20 overs against India, the first match of the international summer between England and India, and we'll keep you across the Indian innings once it begins, as I say, commentary five lives, four texts. Maguire got the ball near the halfway line. Jesse Lingard drops very deep, nil-nil. And really, in terms of chances, they've had quite a lot of possession. They've had the corners, they've had five corners, that Harry Kane's head up that landed on the roof of the net is the closest that we've come to an opening goal in this match. Yeah, I think England's been a better save. As you say, they've had a lot more possession. Not really, the goalkeepers have no real save to make, either, keep up. So, yeah, England have a lot of ball, but they just can't find that final cross, final pass. Harry Kane's probably had the best chance, which was a difficult one. Yeah, he has Young, Young playing it back, towards the centre-circle to Kyle Walker. Now, very much established as a central defender in this first-choice England starting line-up, which we now know it is. Here is Young towards Lingard. Lingard's little ball towards Harry Kane. Kane, the top scorer at this World Cup, remember, with five goals. Sterling, little click on the edge of the area from Ali. Thought if it slipped it through to Lingard, but it was blocked on the edge of the penalty area. Mojica is being forced to run the ball back into his left back position, and then wins a throw-in. The presser in everything's great. The tempo's good, Johnny. It's just final ball. Relax on the ball and make the pitch bigger. It seems, you know, get away, move it quicker, switch the play. Oh, no. That is ridiculous. That was... Falkau was... Falkau tripped behind him, and Falkau literally dived with arms apart, as if he was jumping into a swimming pool. That would have been a belly flop, if he had. That was shocking. Now, that wasn't enough for him to buy that. The lanes were just two yards away. That's one of the dives of the World Cup. Greg Luganas will be proud of that one. Free kick, won by Falkau, nevertheless. And it's still Columbia Nail, England Nail. There's brilliant Colombian sound inside the stadium in Moscow. That's the World Cup for you, isn't it? The sound of Columbia comes to Moscow. Free kick, taken by Osbina. Tripier gets up very well, headed forwards for England. And then Dali Ali, beaten in the air by Carlos Sanchez. But Harry Maguire is there to lift it forwards for Sterling to chase. Sterling up against Davenson Sanchez. Does well, Sterling beats Davenson Sanchez onto his left foot. Shoots straight into Yerimina, who came across the edge of the penalty area. And Columbia were able to clear it. Only partially away though, England back in possession. Maguire gets a touch, and then stones. Now Walker as well. This is good confidence, good touch from England here. And certainly the threat from Sterling, we saw there. Sterling with a flick, but he doesn't find Linde Gardic as it was deflected. And then Ashley Young might just be in to make the ball back, but as he did so, he actually lost possession. And Arias now finds Quadrado. Quintero's interested. Quadrado back onto his right foot. Quintero then reverse passes it straight out of play. We've played half an hour. It's Columbia nil, England nil. And let's just get a feeling from you and Terry Chris on how England has played so far. I think they've done well apart from... For me, Sterling's been on the ball in great areas. But if you give Quintero, if you look their way, he looks at their little passes. He slows up composure, he sees them balls. If he was playing for England now, England would be winning this game 2-3-0 in my eyes. Sterling gets into positions, gets to space, doesn't really set the rate, doesn't see the pass, and that's costing them so far. What about you, Terry? Yeah, it's just that fast tempo in the play. The players seem to be... It's too fast for the players. They haven't got their touch right, and consequently when Sterling's in good position, he's tried one or two little flicks and layoffs, and they haven't been right. And good chances or good possession in good areas has just gone to waste. But even dominating this game, you sort of think, well, a goal is coming. You just need to have a shot or good possession in their half, but I think it's going to come if they just keep playing this way. I think it will. Quadrado goes to a long ball over the top, but Maguire did well. And Maguire is able to shiver the ball out of play. Tashin Sanchez, Quadrado challenging Maguire. And Maguire is now complaining to the assistant there that there was a little bit of naughtiness, I think, from Quadrado. That was next to Terry. Terry, what did you see there? Yeah, Quadrado, I mean, Terry Maguire's looked at him, the ball's running out of play, he's never going to get the ball. And Quadrado's just tried to shoulder charge him. He's not shoulder charging, but on Terry Maguire's chest. Terry Maguire is sort of bounced off, and I mean, I know Ory just laughed in his face. If I was Terry Maguire, I wouldn't have got involved in all the history on it. He just laughed in his face and said, you know, finish yourself, sunshine, no chance. former England captain Terry Butcher, who's watching from behind the goal at that end. Just a few yards away from where Maguire and Quadrado jostled with one another. Ball headed forward towards Falco. Laserback, Kintero snatched at the shot when dragged at Wellway from just outside the deep. Not really coming to terms, I think, with Kintero's teams, haven't they? I mean, luckily enough that Falco's moving has not been very good because Kintero's had a lot of time and space, and he's got a wonderful left foot. But that team had a shot, which was... Oh, well, Mag, they're really weighed, so... But you've just got to keep an eye on him because he can make something happen. Yeah, Columbia nil, England nil, BBC Radio 5 Live. Of course, the World Cup Daily podcast will be out in the morning. Make sure that you download it when you wake up and you'll hear all of the news, we'll bring you all of the interviews, whatever happens here tonight. We'll be down in the tunnel talking to Gareth Southgate and a number of the England players, and you'll hear all of that as well as the usual array of World Cup guests on the 5 Live World Cup Daily podcast. Here's Maguire playing it through towards Sterling to Lingard. Lingard, to suede to his left, Deli Alley is there. Deli Alley, he's taken up some good positions, Chris, but not yet being able to make them count. He's Sterling to the Lingard, he just runs into the challenge and now it's brought away by Jefferson Lerner and Lerner, who's rather slowed this Colombian break, and is actually now running crossfield and rolling the ball across towards Arias. Quadrado says, give it to me, which he does. A little drop of the shoulder and then Quintero, who's another one, who's always one-sinking. He's often a run, but Deli Alley is able to step across and take the ball away from him. And then Ashley Young plays it back to the pitch, then he takes the pitch and then sweeps the ball away downfield, but only onto the chest of Carlos Sanchez. I tell you, he's doing a great job for the Barrios of 5. He's just sitting in front of 2 centre-horses and he becomes a centre-half. When Sterling goes high, he goes into the back 3. When Sterling goes short, he steps in. They've worked really hard at this system. You can see Clungard had to stop Lingard. He was highlighted, wasn't he, by Tim Vickery before the game. There have been reports of Tottenham interest in Vilmar Barrios, who is 24 years old, sturdy little figure. Here is Quintero, who's now often a run towards the edge of the penalty area. But John Stones is able to move across away from Falcao and clear it towards the halfway line. He does look isolated, doesn't he, Falcao? As the lone striker, Nil Nel. Quadrado, who's now central, plays the ball across. But Deli Alley got a block on that, still bounced to Sanchez though for Colombia. 10 minutes to go to halftime, it's still Nil Nel. And even though the game has been played at some pace, we've really yet to see a clear-cut goal-scoring opportunity. Stones is able to volley the ball away, a sort of cushion volley towards Deli Alley. And now Maguire at the back. Maguire plays it back to Stones, who passes the ball between Falcao and Quadrado. Fortunately, Deli Alley was there. And now Harry Maguire steps out with it. Big Harry Maguire, 10 yards inside the Colombian half, uses Harry Kane. Kane squared a Henderson. Henderson now just rolls it invitingly across into the path of Lindgard. Back to Henderson, Henderson's ball over the top, evades everyone. Kane peeled away from Arias, but it's through for a goal kick. He's the first to have solved Jordan Henderson, haven't we? You've not really seen him in the game. That's all. He's never been on the ball. He's never had up for back three. Not really one of any tackles. That's the first time I've really seen him come into the game. Against Tunisia, Chris, if you remember, his influence increased as the game went on. And England needed him back. He's got a lot of responsibility playing for that three. There's a lot of movement. Bentero's dropping in behind him, Mareth from right of him. It's a difficult role to keep an eye on players who are dropping off. Columbia Nail, England Nail. And now a television screen. I think that was Lothar Matthias, wasn't it? We just saw a shutter. That's just to annoy you and Terry. He's here as a FIFA guest as well. Lothar Matthias. He's falk out for Columbia, but couldn't wriggle away from the England defence and walker who was able to play it back towards Pickford. John Stones has a look over his shoulder. There's no one there. So Stones is able to run the ball away towards the halfway line. Harry Kane again has dropped extremely deep to the extent that he's inside his own half. He's done that on a number of occasions. Kane actually plays almost a holding midfielder in the position that he is at the moment. Then passes the ball forward. Kane gradually makes ground through the middle while England have possession on the left. Sterling and Lingard. Now it is with Kane. Kane tried to slip the pass through towards Sterling's run and it was just cut out. But it comes back to Harry Kane, middle of the Columbia half. Deli Alley back to Kane. That's the top of understanding. Kane tries to take it on and then in dives low. My fouls, Kane, brings him down and it's a free kick in a good position that Deli Alley was thinking about taking quickly and Sanchez actually stepped in front of him. I think they're going to take the time now. He needed a shot on goal and Harry Kane, no, doesn't fancy it. So it's probably Trippia. It was a free kick. I've seen the benefit of a replay. Trippia's putting the ball down. Kane's OK. That's a massive issue with England, isn't it? What England do at this World Cup in these knockout stages? It feels that Harry Kane is absolutely pivotal to that. If he'd scored with that header, I mean that would have been so cold. He'd been able to get to that because he made so much ground to get in there and get his head to it. But anyway, he's won the free kick here and it's a free kick in a position left of centre. And given the angle, this will be 22-23 yards. And the referee Mark Geiger is, it seems to be struggling to get the ball back. It's a great position. I think the ball is that big as well. You can get it up and over from where you are. It's very possible. But for me, I'd whip it with a bit of pace and aim where the goal is standing. To the right of the wall, I wouldn't go over it. I'd go to where the goal is standing. Because the goalkeeper at that angle thinks you're going to go over the walls. I'm not sure what is the problem here with this. I mean now Lin Gard's got involved. Who's gone down? There's an England player, Jordan Henderson, who's down holding his head. Lin Gard's seen something. He's asking for a far. I said he's been nutted. And now actually we're going to see a shot of this. There's not a huge amount in that. No, I don't think. It's a Barrios who puts his head into the chest of Jordan Henderson and catches his jaw. And Henderson actually goes down. Henderson goes down holding his face. Are we surprised if there's anything happening to that? Actually, Jung's having a goal at the right time. It's actually one of those, I wonder, whether he's actually bitten his tongue, maybe, Jordan Henderson. Because it's one of those where you get a bash on the chin. They are checking though on the AR to see what they make of that. And the referee is going to call across Barrios. He's just going to have a yellow card. I mean, he shouldn't have done what he did. I don't know why there's a problem. If you're standing in the wall, you're allowed to. Still players are gathered around. And the referee is talking to Barrios, who incidentally will miss the next match. Because that's his second yellow card of the World Cup. Columbia get through to play Sweden, we won't be seeing Wilmar Barrios. Right call there, Chris? Yeah, he's got the replay. He shouldn't do what he did. You're only pushed and shoved. And why do you need to do anything like that? Because it wasn't, say, overtly aggressive. So yeah, he's giving me yellow. Pretty easy being a red, mate. But the thing is, the whole thing there was created. Because surely it's a simple process. The referee sprays his right leg, which he is now doing. And it's very simple to get the players behind the white line. I'm not sure what the issue was. England players are standing in front of the Colombian wall, Harry Maguire's around the back. Henderson has recovered from his bang on the chin. Trippie is still waiting. This is taking an absolute age. I see Quadrado is standing. Yeah, he's about four yards away. Trippie is going to take the free kick over the wall. But why did they go? To be honest, he's hit that well. But he's got to hit the target. He's got it up and over the wall quite easily. But he's a good what? He's good two, three yards away to the post. So he struck it really well. Got it, a target. 41 minutes played. Colombian nil, England nil. BBC Radio 5 Live. And if you haven't heard, if you've been at work or out and about, Sweden won earlier. So England, if they win this, if they get through this, they'll say Sweden in the quarterfinal on Saturday, which will be three o'clock in the United Kingdom, three o'clock DST in Samara. We will have a 6-06 after the match tonight. Kelly Cates will be overseeing operations. I think you're involved, Chris, for Sutton as well, and Terry Butcher. And we'll let you know when the lines are open. The Colombian nil, England nil. I think it's entirely possible that it could deteriorate in the second half, because so much is at stake. And Colombia have taken this approach with the three central midfielders, relying a lot on Cuadrado and Quintero, and obviously Falcao up front through the middle, the 32-year-old playing in his first World Cup Radimal Falcao, who was actually named after the famous Falcao of 1982, because it's his middle name. His father gave him the name of Falcao. Here is Quintero. Quintero looks for Falcao, but it wasn't on as an option, so he uses Cuadrado, he wins his foot over the ball, and then Dele Alli is able to get a little touch in. That was one of the Champions League concentrations. We watched this week, Dele Alli and Cuadrado. Not feeling his thigh there again, is it? Dele Alli? No. He rolled off the pitch, and I think Garis Southgate suggested to the fourth official that there might have been a bang at Heggs there. Here's Dele Alli. It's 0-0, half-time approaching, and the ball is curled forward by Lehmann, but straight through to Jordan Pickford, who overarms it out to trip here on the far side. Back it comes towards Kyle Walker. Walker, but towards Sterling, who gets a little tug, but no free kick. Columbia with Quintero. Quintero whips the ball forward, but there's far too much on that, and it will run away through for a goal kick to Ingram. So really, really, just the one chance. Even that was a half chance. Yeah, Kane's chance, but Ingram being a better save, possession-wise, looked good temple about them. You can see how Columbia's game plan is. They're just basically playing for a chance to set piece of counter-attack. They're going all the way through it with shootout. You can see the way they've set up. They really are a bit scared of England. You can see how they've put so many yellow sheets behind the ball. Kane wins a head air against Galen-Sanchez. Then Kane gets it back. There's a little bit of space. He's going to have a shot, which he does, but it bounces away across the face of goal, and then Sterling and Mina have got involved in something. And there's a bit of a niggle certainly in this game now. There's no question about that. Sterling, Mina ended up on the ground. I mean, how Sterling ended up... Well, that was little and large. Flooring Mina is anyone's wonder. Well, it's got a hold of him. Look at that. Mina's got his arms around Sterling. Sterling's got his hands around... Sterling's got his hands around grabbing Mina short. And then... Well, what has he fallen over for? Watch Mina here. Well, if we can see it, we don't want to see this. And the replay, but... Trevor Burbeck after May Taiselhead comes to mind. Three minutes of added time. I suppose it's only three minutes. Yeah, true. It took three minutes to take that big kick. Columbia Nail, England Nail. Mark Chapman's here with us in the stadium. The Spartak Moscow stadium. And... Mark with us at half-time as Osbina takes this goal kick. Quadrado bounces off him. Cantero. Now Arias leaning back. Jung puts in the challenge. Arias gets up and then Deli Ali is able to block it out of play for throwing down the right flank. Arias is in no hurry here to recover the ball from in front of the England dugout. No-Hammes Red Riguez. If you haven't heard that news, the great Colombian star who is the top scorer of the World Cup scored that brilliant goal remember against Yuriyu Aguaio. You and I were watching it work the other day. Balls played 4-4, Columbia. Harry Maguire heads it away. Deli Ali feels that he was bundled over by Lerner. And now he's got a free kick. Falcao has got it on the right-hand side. Falcao trying to cross blocked by two defenders for England. Now Arias again. Arias to Quintero on his left foot. Shoots, but it's straight at Pickford. It dipped rather awkwardly. I think it might have taken a little deflection, but Pickford dealt with it securely. Can't give Quintaro that much space. He's got great left footwork, so already in his game and didn't probably hit it as well as he liked, but can't give him that space. That's probably one chance all. Chance from 22-23 yards out. In added time at the end of the first half. England perhaps one last attack of this first period. Nil-nil. Lingard out to the right. Then the ball comes in. Sterling was after it. It was clear to win. Then Lingard stretches for it. 12-13 yards from goal, but can only shoot high over the cross. Wait, Paul in. Shippio again getting down that right. Really asking questions with that cross. Sterling was just coming in behind it. And then Giles was always high. Oh, is that the alley is injured? Alley has a problem. Yep. He did clash with Arias just a few moments ago when he rolled off the pitch. I think it was a way he fell, John. I'm not sure if he's tweaked his muscle, which he's had a problem with. He's on his back, and now he rolls over onto his knees. And he's got the... He's got the... And he always has this strapping on his legs. Doesn't be this sort of surgical cape. The deli alley, who obviously went off injured during the Tunisia game, had the problem, the luthi problem. And is now being very carefully looked at by the England medical people. Harry Kane is a concerned observer. It's actually a kick in, well... It's a kick... I thought when he fell over, and there he's been caught there, but when he fell in the other dugout, I thought he tweaked something there. He looked like he wasn't happy when he got up. I think it might have been caught in the other regions there. True, true. So maybe it's not too much of a worry, at least in the long term. Columbian nil, England nil. The alley alley is being led off the field, and he's OK. It's got to be halftime now anyway. Yeah, it is. Goal kick, Osbina to take it. I think this might be the last action of the first half. Alley still waiting to come back onto the field. Osbina takes an edge to take this goal kick, which he does now. Harry Maguire wins the header on the halfway line against Lerma, and Barrios nods it forward. Kintero stabs it up towards Falcao. Falcao to the far side to Mohica, where his weight wristbands on Mohica. Now Lerma allows it to run to Arias. Still we play on. Four minutes have had a time of being played. Quadrado plays it in, rather daintily cleared away by John Stones, who readjusted. And then Falcao coming from an offside position, and it's a free kick to England to go on penalty area. England's been a better save, but it's been quite scrappy. I could say it's becoming very cagey in the second half. It's going to slow down the pace. If you get a chance, you've got to take it. I hope everyone's nerves are up to it back home. England, and the knockout stages of a major tournament. We all know the penalty record, and we all know that they've won only two matches in knockout stages of the major tournament since Euro 96. And it's Nel Nel at halftime, and the players, the England players, trot towards this side of the field. Let off the field by John Stones and Jordan Henderson. The Colombian players are walking off the field. Ashley Young just has something to say to referee Geiger. But halftime, halftime here in Moscow, it is Colombia Nel, England Nel. Mark Chapman is here with us, and we'll have questions for Terry Butcher and Chris Waddle. He has England have not won a match in the knockout stages of a major tournament for 12 years. That's why Terry Butcher says it's a big a half ahead of them. Colombian Nel, England Nel. We've got Terry Butcher, we've got Chris Waddle here in the commentary position, so 139 England caps worth of experience in the Spartak Moscow Stadium with us. The second half begins, England kick off in the all red kit with the white numbers, white names. And Colombia, the yellow shirt, winning an immediate free kick, white shorts and white socks. No substitutions at halftime, so Colombia with Ospina, Arias Mina, Davinson Sanchez and Mohica in midfield. Barrios with Lerma and Sanchez either side of him, Carlos Sanchez, and then Juan Cuadrado, Juan Quintero and Radimal Falcao. And the England team, as it was, to start the World Cup against Tunisia, Pickfering goal, Walker, Stones and McGuire, Trippia and Jung, the wing backs, Henderson with Lingard and Ali either side, and then Sterling and captain and leading scorer at this World Cup, Harry Kane. So Colombian Nel, England Nel, the incident in the Colombian penalty area, involving Barrios' head and Jordan Henderson's chin, obviously creating a great deal of discussion at halftime, as Stones heads the ball over the halfway line, for England and it comes back for Colombia and it's worked out here to the left hand side to Mohica, but Trippia was in front of him and the ball deflects all the way back towards Davinson Sanchez. So Chris, you wanted to see a little bit more from Jordan Henderson, I sense. I don't think he's got on the ball enough, he's got, basically nobody around him. And he's screening obviously the centre forward Falcao, but he's not got on the ball enough, and not got into him enough and he's not got the ball, he's not looked for it enough for me, but I think Colombian have just come here to spoil. They think, you know, we'll spoil the game and we'll unsettle the game and not give them any other rhythm, and if it goes extra time, it goes extra time, after that we'll even take it then. Also ball from Falcao, just spooned it straight out of play as he tried to flick it to quadrado. They're sitting here, five-life comedy position, just to the left of the half-way line, quite low down, probably in the what, 20-25th roll back. So in the lower tier of the stadium, which is packed full of Colombians, the outnumber England supporters probably four to one. Stones bringing the ball out from the back, Falcao is after him. So Stones rolls it across to Maguayah, and now the other central defender, Kyle Walker, receives it, Trippia, two Stones again, and then Trippia has to stretch and play it back to Walker, who allows it to run back towards the edge of the penalty area. Colombian nil, England nil, and the lines are open already for 606. 08, 08, 5, 9, 09, 6, 9, 3. Kelly Cage will be hosting in our studio down at Red Square. Chris Waddle and Terry Butcher will be involved. Chris Sutton as well in Rostov as England play the ball forward towards Sterling, but Davidson Sanchez step forward, and the ball was eventually deflected out of play, near the half-way line for a throwing to Colombia. So nil nil and Mohica will keep this just in front of where Colombia's 68-year-old manager is standing in his dark blue suit and his rather stylish, comfortable shoes with their white soles. He has the look of a sort of Bill Nye-type figure, doesn't he, Peckerman, as it's headed away near the edge of the area by Walker and the free kick given England's way for a foul. The Stones was going to take quickly, but there's certainly, you know, one thing we have to watch here, and this is a real test, Chris, for referee Geiger, is that there is an awful lot going on in this game, and there's a bit of feeling here. The stakes are very high. There has been niggle, whatever happened with Raheem Sterling as he was leaving the pitch at the end of the first half. Stones and Sterling and Mina have had a couple of coming together. Jung and Arias are another combination who've been at one another, as Davidson Sanchez heads the ball into center field to Cuadrado, and it comes back into central defence, where Barrios is actually stationed in between the two central defenders. Now it's up to the right-hand side. You can tell that's an uncompromising challenge from Harry Maguire on the half-way line, which is not given as a free kick. I've got to say, it's starting off scrappy, isn't it? It's nothing put together, and they're going to use all the tricks in the book, Columbia, there's no doubt about that. They know a few, so they're unsettling here, England, when they get into a little bit of rhythm, and they're quite happy to foul, stop the game, and really get on to the referee, and in a minute it's really scrappy football. Over and played between the two penalty areas. Lindgard to Stones. Now Harry Kane. Oh, Lindgard finds a little bit of space. Lindgard slips it square towards Deli Alley, whose challenge went down quite theatrically there, as Davidson Sanchez, his clubmate, put the challenge in. I don't think it was a free kick, but it wasn't given. Here's Falcao. Falcao now for Cuadrado. Mojica is available, but Harry Kane is back there, battling deep inside his own half, and Cuadrado keeps possession and plays it back into the centre circle. Mina. Now Lerma. Arias slips it infield towards Barrios. Barrios over hits the ball through. Falcao went one way, the ball just ran through towards Jordan Pickford. So Columbia nil, England nil, and already this match, which has thrown up very few goal-scoring opportunities, has the feel of one that may well be heading beyond the 90 minutes. But we'll see. Here's Henderson. Stones makes a run forward. Henderson goes back to Walker, who has no other option but to go back to pick. No, it's getting... England's coming there, falling into the trap of Columbia. Columbia's quite happy the weather game's panning out the minute. It suits them, but England's got to get back and move on the ball quicker. Bit more options, bit more of the ball from sight to sight, a lot more. A little bit of something between Sterling and Lerma, just off the ball when they challenge for it together. Eventually he bounces out a play for a throw in to England down the far side, that Deli Alley is going to take. Deli Alley actually will leave it for Ashley Young, who's arrived at the touchline. Ashley Young, oldest man in this England squad. There's a young England team. Young gets it back now to Lingard. Back to Ashley Young again, winning his 37th cap tonight. Ashley Young, remember he was one of the men who missed the penalty in the shootout in which England went out of Euro 2012. Now Harry Kane is challenged illegally by Arias, who has shown a yellow card for that challenge on Harry Kane. From where we are, we've just seen him replay there. Harry Kane gets it first, and he barges him in the back, knocks him to the floor, so the referee got that right. Harry has much smaller man, leapt for it with his elbow into the back, into the small of Harry Kane's back. So it's a first chance for England to swing a free kick into the Colombian penalty area in this second half. Ashley Young, just getting his sock sorted out, pulling him up over his knees. And Harry Kane, taking up a position right at the back post. Harry Maguire is there as well. Dali Ali too. The referee gives the signal, played in by Young. Harry Maguire, close to getting his head to it, the Davinson Sanchez. Well defended again by the Tottenham Central defender, just got there to glance it through for a corner. Yeah, great ball in. It's a brilliant header there. It just spotted the danger. Just in time as well. Harry Maguire is just about ahead. Corner, that's a well-got. This is ridiculous. This is absolutely ridiculous. Particularly when you consider that we now have the possibility of the video assistant referee. Four England players have almost information. Kane, Maguire, Stones and Henderson are... Are they going to do the conga, do you think? It's a corner, Trippie takes it towards the back post. It's headed back across the repeals. The repeals, has that been given as a penalty? And a yellow. Yes it is, it's a penalty to England. I think it's Harry Kane who ended up on the ground, in amongst a crowd of players. A yellow card has been shown and England have been awarded a penalty. Although there's still some anger here. The Colombian players are surrounding referee Guy Gagher. But Harry Kane was right in front of the referee. Look at that Sanchez. Carlos Sanchez, hold him, it was almost under the referee's nose. He could not miss it. And the penalty's been given. VAR has checked it. The check is over. Still the players are protesting. I don't know what the right contest is about. Carlos Sanchez has been yellow carded. And it is going to be a penalty to England. Harry Kane will have a chance, he's got the ball in his hands. He will have a chance here to score his third penalty of this World Cup. And to score his sixth goal. And still the referee is having to face protests from Radamel Falcao. Ospina the goalkeeper is there. And also the man who conceded the penalty, Carlos Sanchez. This all happened at Terry Butcher's end of the ground. What did you see Terry? Well I saw something, I don't see something, I saw it like... I think it was Sanchez or... Not too sure it was Mark and Harry Kane. Yeah, he picked him up at the back and he was having a wheelbarrow race. We have at the parents' sports meeting, he had a wheelbarrow race with Harry Kane. Dumped him on the floor, right in front of the referee. The referee was watching somewhere else and then saw this happen on its own in a space. It's an obvious penalty. There's a quick VAR check, it was very quick. There's a penalty. And over the penalty spot, one or two of them are just roughing up the penalty spot with their studs. I mean this is a disgrace. An absolute disgrace. That is awful and now they can't accept the fact that someone has manhandled England's captain on the floor. It's a penalty. Get away from the referee. They're also trying to get at Harry Kane as well. He was trying to compose himself and the Colombian players, several of them went to Harry Kane who just wandered away. He's booked Jordan Henderson. Jordan Henderson's been booked. Yeah, he's just done booked him, look. Well, we're seeing pictures of Jordan Henderson who, one of the Colombian players was buzzing around behind him. Jordan Henderson just sort of moved his head back into it. And that's why he's been yellow carded. Yep, but the referee got no control over the game. It's only going to get worse. The referee needed that to take a grip because this is ridiculous. For it to take this long to calm all of that down and get the penalty taken. It's ludicrous really. And we're still seeing David Ospina not getting back into position. But here we are then. It's nil nil. England have a penalty and Harry Kane is going to take it. Having already scored two brilliant penalties against Panama which he took right-frooded, high to the goalkeepers right. They were struck so well they were unstoppable. Will he go the same way again? He told me he's been practicing and practicing and practicing penalties. So here he is to give England the lead in the last 16. He has gone down the middle and he scored. It's 1-0 to England and it's captain Harry Kane with his sixth goal at this World Cup. And that matches Gary Linnicka's total at Mexico 86. But it also gives England a valuable and crucial lead. They are ahead in this round of 16 tie. 1-0 against Colombia. I don't know if the referee is having a very good game but he got that decision right. It was a pen and Harry Kane goes down in the middle. Ospina has obviously saw him hit two to the goal. He's dived early and he's just placed it straight down the middle. He didn't just place on it as well. He didn't blast it, save four, goalkeeper has gone to the ground. And England deserve it. It's been a scrappy match but the referee for me is spoiling the game. Still the Colombians are talking to the referee. Still they're on at him. And now finally the match gets underway again. Terry just gives another thought on what just happened there. Obviously we talked about the penalty. But the referee for me was saying that he was playing with him. It was absolutely a picture of concentration. He just looked at the ball and he just glanced up at the way Ospina was. Now a bit of bother here in the centre circle. John Stones, Radamel Falcao has gone down clutching his face. The two of them tangled as the ball went over the top of them. Falcao is down still. He looked at John Stones. He's been together challenging for the ball. And Stones sort of pulled his foot out from where it was. And catches the side of Falcao's head. We can see that on the replay here. Falcao out of his leg and he would have let him go. So he kicks it out, throws it out but it catches him on the head. But he's up. More from Terry Butcher in a moment. Free kick taken quickly. Cantero hits a shot, it rattles across the edge of the England penalty area. Davinson Sanchez has been watched by Harry Maguire. He's been able to work it back into the penalty area. But Henderson clears the way downfield where it will be kept in and played back into central defence to Barrios. And now forward towards Carlos Sanchez who was the Colombian player booked in the conceding of the England penalty. Sterling now gets the ball down, plays it just behind Lingard. And so Carlos Sanchez can readjust and play it out. Here to the left-hand side to Mohica. Chris? Yeah, I'm just thinking England's got to keep their mains on the game. Don't get involved with their diving, the dramatic survival here, the Colombians here, they're niggling you, they're frustrating you. Don't buy it, play your football and the winners are getting quite comfortable. You don't want to get involved and they're going to bring on Falcao. Let's just bring in Terry again from down at pitch level. Terry Butcher. Yeah, I mean Harry Kane picked this spot and it was unbelievable. Just really focused on what he had to do. It was always going to end up in the back of the net. And the whole of the England bench up there, virtually on the edge of the pitch, to celebrate as well, that's what you want to see. He's going to bring off Jose Pacquem and one of his three central midfielders. Lermer, I can see his red number 16 is on the board already. So in this position, he has to do that, 1-0 down. And we're already into the last half hour of this match. England leading 1-0 and on course now for a quarter-final meeting with Sweden. But it is very finely balanced and there's an awful long way to go. And an awful lot in this match. Eyes needed everywhere. Just as well we've got Terry down at pitch level, Chris. He'll see everything down there. Backer waiting to come under the field. England just looking to take the sting out of it here in possession. Played back to John Stones. Dele Alli makes himself available. Dele Alli now over the halfway line. Alli rolls the ball forward down the left-hand side for Lindgard. But Mina is able to come across and steer it out of play. And I'm told there were 3 minutes and 31 seconds between the awarding and the taking of the England penalty. And the change is now going to be made. And as I say, it's Lermer coming off and Carlos Backer is coming onto the field for Colombia. And number 7, winning his 48th cap. The Villarreal man as he is currently. So England leading 1-0. Now Harry Kane continuing his record of scoring in every match in which he started as the England captain. 8 of them it is now. That is 12 goals in those 8 matches in which he started. And also he has just scored in a 6th consecutive England game. And that's not been done since 1939 when Tommy Lawton scored in 6 in a row. The records just keep falling to the World Cup's leading scorer. Stretching his lead with 6 goals now. 1-0 England lead, BBC 5 Live with England at the World Cup.

England with a free kick out on the left-hand side. Second goal now would make it look quite rosy. Young fires it in deep towards Maguire at the back post. Who heads it across for the shot from Kane as blocked. Oh then Kane gets a touch. He went down in the box. It's curled into the back post and it's headed across the face of goal and over the top by Deli Ali and the Columbians. Now a racing towards referee Geiger again. Falcao, he's been shown a yellow card. Harry Meena is waving his arms at the referee and the referee, the Columbians it would appear. Sense that Mark Geiger, the referee can be got out here and Falcao is furious about something that's happened in there. I don't know what happened in there. I don't see what's happened but that wasn't a pin in Harry Maguire's look. He didn't get a yellow because he's died there. It's when the ball came in from Trippie. Here we go. They're saying he's off save still. But he didn't hit it. And Deli Ali with the header from the angle that was over. He was stretching for it. He was falling and he headed it over the top. The attendance by the way, 44,195 live. The cricket, the 2020 international is over on 5 live sports extra. India are chasing 160 to win it back in the UK at Old Trafford. Columbia Nail England 1. And we have played 63 nearly 64 minutes. Probably played at 55 as much as that. Stones with the ball at the back. Stones is caught there by Carlos Bacca. The ball had gone and it's a yellow card for Bacca who's just come onto the field. And Bacca as John Stones gets up, Bacca comes across and pulls the arm of John Stones. It's just laid, just a little bit naughty. India by the way, 126 for 1 after 12 all those needing as I say 160 to win. So that's a yellow card for Carlos. He's got a yellow card even before he had written his name on the team sheet. 1-0 to England. Paul Bouncing into the penalty area. Mina had to head it away under pressure from Raheem Sterling and then it's played out. And then down goes Arias when he was challenged by Delhi Ali. And this, I don't think it's been refereed well but this is becoming a very difficult game to referee. You feel sorry for the referee, I've got to say the way, I'm not saying it's England, definitely not. But Columbia, the way their players are reacting, they're a disgrace. And I'm sure something will happen after this game regardless of the result. Now, Columbia 0, England 1, 25 minutes to play. England are winning, they're 25 minutes away from a place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup against Sweden. England have not won a match in the knockout stages of a tournament since 2006. But they're almost literally going to have to battle for this. The Colombian supporters heavily outnumbering the England fans, rallying themselves and raising themselves as Delhi Ali is fouled on the half-way line. This time by Barrios who is on a yellow card. Currently five Colombians have been yellow carded. Barrios, Arias, Colos Sanchez, Falcao and Bacca. Jordan Henderson is the one England player to have received the yellow card. Free kick, 25 minutes to go. He's got to keep the calm England, keep playing the football, don't get involved. I'm sure that Garry Southgate will have spoken about this, this scenario. It's entirely possible that in the World Cup you will end up facing this sort of challenge. Maguire, who certainly dived in the Colombian penalty area and was fortunate not to be yellow carded, swings the pass out towards the right-hand side to Trippier where it was not out of play by Mohica. And Trippier to take the throw in. Harry Kane, who's just scored his 19th goal for England in his 27th appearance. Trippier plays the ball in towards the edge of the box. Cantero can't really get into the game in the second half. Cantero plays it up towards Bacca and now Colombia look to break. Cantero with the outside of his left boot couldn't find the pass down the right-hand side to Quadrado. In fact it was cut out by Ashley Young and Ashley Young has set off on a counter-attack. Raheem Sterling available. A lovely piece of skill from Sterling to set in Young who crosses it but there's no one there. And actually Young has gone down whether he was caught late after the ball had gone and not sure. I don't think Colombia will kick it out. The ball played up towards Falcao and the ball bounces out of play for a throw in near the half-way line. Ashley Young is still down way over there in the far corner. And now Jose Pacquermann is much more animated. He's changed his system. He's taken off under the holding midfielders. The referee has gone across to have a look at Ashley Young. It was Arias who put the challenge in on him. Young crossed. And really there's not a great deal in that. And he may have fallen awkwardly. I don't know but he stayed down. And so we've got a stoppage in play. So let's get another thought from Terry Butcher who's down at pitch level behind the goal. Well I think England just got to keep their course. Chris says it's anti-football from Colombia. I mean Quintero's on the ball. Occasionally it's sporadic. England win the ball back but it's just niggly niggly stuffing. They've just got to keep their discipline, keep their cool. And I think they'll get another goal because they've lost all discipline at Colombia. England can't afford to do that. Terry you must have played against this sort of approach over the years. Oh yeah. You can't rise to it. Honestly you want to do something. You want to throw something or whatever. You can't now. Especially with so many cameras about here and the referee. You don't know what this referee is going to do at all. So yeah, I've played in that. I thought those days were gone. You obviously don't want to see that back in football. But unfortunately it is. For a team that's got less quality than England. Less ability than England but they're resorting to these tactics. I think I'm right in saying that Colombia won the fair play award in Brazil at the World Cup four years ago when they entertained us with Jamez Rodriguez to the four. He can't play tonight. He's injured. One nil England lead. Now Jesse Lindgard is yellow carded. There wasn't much more than a little tap with his right boot on the back of Carlos Sanchez's leg. But that's a yellow card now for Jesse Lindgard. So that is seven yellow cards in the match. It's hard for the referee. Don't go his wrong. But he hasn't got to get carried away himself. He's got to try and stamp his authority on his game which he hasn't got at the minute. Colombia nil England won. Talk to us about this match 08 08 590 9693 Kelly Cates hosting 606. We'll bring you all of the interviews as well from the tunnel during the course of the program. You'll hear all that on the podcast as well in the morning. The World Cup Daily, the five live World Cup Daily podcast. The 2020 International is all that on five live sports extra. The Wimbledon coverage as well continues on the BBC Sport website and app. And more blanket coverage from Wimbledon tomorrow. But the World Cup here is alive in front of our eyes with England 1 nil up. Lindgard playing it back towards Maguire. Maguire the touch to stones who rolls it out square to his right to Kyle Walker. Now Falcao does have that support from Bakker. So Colombia playing with two men up front. Three at the back, one still screening to wing backs and they're pushing on. They realise the game's going away from them. They've got a challenge push on here. 20 minutes to play. Ashley Young on the far side does well. They work the ball down the left wing towards Deli Alley. Deli Alley cuts back against Arias and then sees Young there in support. Young drops his shoulder, plays it infield towards Sterling. Now back towards Henderson, middle of the Colombian half. Henderson, his pass towards Trippia. Trippia just caught by Mohica. That's not given as a free kick. Kyle Walker was trying to referee the game himself there and the referee ignored England's claims for a free kick. I thought Trippia was caught and must say really close. I think there's not a lot in it. Tickford back into session. His long pass. Trippia jumps against Mohica and the ball evades both of them out of play for a throw in to Colombia. Barrios says, come on, give it to me. I want it on my chest and he does. Barrios then lifts the ball forward towards Bacca. Maguire's got to be careful, stands up strong. Bacca bounces into Maguire, goes down. Howls from the crowd, the Colombian fans for a free kick. Bacca as well, appeals, hands apart. Referee Geiger says no. Stones passing the ball away from his own penalty area. Maguire now young with a long pass downfield for Sterling to chase. Sterling has just nudged Arias off the ball. Arias used a bit of experience here, didn't he? He wasn't going to get it. He ran into Sterling really and falls to the ground. Referee buys it. 1-0 England lead. Harry Kane's penalty in the 58th minute. Harry Kane, who is on the halfway line watching walk out. Cross into Colombian territory and then turn tail and head back into his own half and giving it to Trippia. Harry Kane, who now has 14 goals in his last 10 England appearances. And as I say, has matched the total that Gary Lenaker reached in 86. Ball played through to Lindgard. Lindgard looking to chip it across, but Davinson Sanchez slid across, went to ground and blocked it behind for a corner. Good football by England. Very patient, nice pace about it. Chris Passen, lot of good movement off the ball. Lindgard gets in there. It's a great tackle again. The two-cent-ars of Dilley Dixon's job for Cunger today. They have the young player of Yeri Mina, who's only 23 years old. Davinson Sanchez, 22 last month. Corner them to England from the left. They lead by one goal to nil. Time must have slowed for Garasovgate down there. Young takes it. Maguire with the header. Osbina just watches it land on the roof of his net. He was stretching high, so high that his gloves were actually over the top of the bar. In England, we're wondering whether it might have caught his gloves before it dropped onto the roof of the net. But the referee said no. Actually, he might have had a case just watching it again. Columbia nil, England won. Harry Maguire, here in Russia, has become only the second England player to have scored six goals at a World Cup finals tournament. He's got power to add if England progress. Here is Harry Kane. Kane, away from Carlos Sanchez. Three Colombians around him. Quadrado comes in with a heavy challenge, and Kane goes down, and it's a free kick. Two England in a good position left of Sanchez. I know, but he talks about Columbia being a good football team, and do this and do that. They've been animals tonight. They've been shocked, and they were discouraged to the game. Really? They said it would be as strong as that. I think they've been a disgrace. This is a World Cup, it's an exhibition. People want to watch good football. They just come out with a mentality. You have spoiled the game, foul, pushed the referee to the limit. You don't want to see it. I hope they get a hefty fine. Free kick to England. Young and Trippie are together. Trippie runs away. England have posed problems with this Ashley Young free kick that is whipped in. England have already won one penalty for wrestling in the penalty area. Young plays it into the back post. Kane goes for it, and actually the flag was up. He went for it with a Kung Fu style kick. Harry Kane, but couldn't make contact, and Eden if he had. As I say, the flag was up. So Columbia nail England one. Terry Butcher, you heard what Chris Waddle had to say there. Are you feeling similarly? Yes, absolutely. Chris 100 per cent spot on. I'll tell you what, on that occasion, because the referee has given the penalty for the free kick, they did not know what to do, Columbia. Whether they stick or twist, and in the end they let England's runners through. The ball wasn't quite right, and they get away with it, Columbia. But they don't know what to do now, and all their discipline has gone, Columbia. Falcow goes. Columbia get a fortunate break, and the ball in centre field. Falcow gives it to Quadrado, a couple of step overs, and then Quadrado passes it. Straight to Delhi Alley on the edge of the England penalty area. That's very interesting what Terry says there, and it's at his end of the field now, where England are attacking, that there could be possibilities for England from set pieces, because Columbia are wary of the fact that they've already conceded a penalty for the holding of Harry Kane. It was Mojica on the left-hand side, couldn't get past Tripier. Tridon again couldn't get past Tripier. Now Barrios rolls a pass out to the right-hand side to Arias. Quintero thought about going with the ball to the edge of the box, thought twice. Arias uses Quadrado on the right-hand side. Quadrado's aerial ball in is headed away by Walker, headed further away by Lingard, but back to the yellow shirts of Columbia. Devinson Sanchez shapes his pass towards Quintero again on his left foot. Quintero's ball in towards Bakker, Bakker got a touch to that, but it bounced down and was swept away by the left foot of Kieran Tripier. England just come off the pace lately, last couple of minutes showing that's why Columbia is putting some passes together. They've not done this old game, and England's just dropped off. I don't like to see that, you let the tempo to keep going a little bit. Maybe a couple of players are feeling the pace. We're into the last 15 minutes. Gareth Southgate is yet to make a substitution. 15 minutes. England are away from the place in the quarter-finals. Ball into the penalty area, Bakker lifts it across, headed away, and then it's cleared crucially. A little touch by Deli Alley on the edge of the area. Ashley Young gets a touch as well to play it away to Sterling. Sterling now running, Sterling with England coming forward. It's three against two. Sterling still going. Trace to find Lingard. Lingard into the box, oh, he's challenged. Devinson Sanchez comes in with a challenge. Referee says no penalty. Must have taken the ball. Why would Lingard go down? He's just got the pull of the trigger, wasn't he? So why would he go down? Well, if he hasn't, if he's dived, he deserves a yell at it. But from where we're sitting, which is quite a way away from the incident, Terry will have a proper view of it. Terry, what did you think? I thought he's caught in there. Lingard was about to pull the trigger, and the sliding leg comes alongside Lingard, takes him down. And for me, that's a penalty. It's a stick-on penalty. Columbia crossing from the left, but it's headed away on the edge of the box by John Stones. Terry will have a great view of that. We've not seen it again on the replay yet, as Lingard plays at the Henderson. Henderson's ball across, and now Columbia are having to commit men downfield, and gaps are opening for England. Lingard's got to use the ball well. That's the key now, got that composure. Right pass, right selection. It's 1-0 to England. Harry Kane's penalty making the difference, but a niggly, awful game. Ball played in towards the edge of the box to Falcao. Falcao turning onto his left foot. Falcao has to play it back out of the penalty area to Mojica. Mojica has Kyle Walker in front of him, so it has to turn. Play it back to Carlos Sanchez. Now the dangerous Quintera. Quintera's ball to the edge of the box. Falcao challenged and fouled. Fri kick to England, and I think we'll see the second Columbian change. Still no immediate sign of England making their first substitution. And it's going to be midfielder, Matheus Uribe, who is coming on into the midfield for Carlos Sanchez, the Columbians who is on a yellow card. Whether that's a factor or not, I don't know. Uribe, who is a box-to-box midfielder, who plays in Mexico for Club America, being in excellent form this year. He is on the number 15. And we have just over 11 minutes to play. It's going to be tense. Unless England can come up with a second goal. Kane heads it forward towards the edge of the box. That's nodded away by Dignina Falcao with a touch on the halfway line. And then Quintera to the right-hand side, to Cuadrado. England are going to make a change. It's Eric Dyer, I see, being prepared down to our right. Falcao stretches for it, can't get to it. John Stone steps forward and passes the ball to Harry Kane. Kane has a look over his shoulder. Kane tracks the ball away from Barrios and then bundled over. It's a free kick to England on the halfway line. Barrios, who has been yellow carded. If we take Dele Alli off, who has just come out of an injury, would think Dyer can sit alongside Ennisson, just to keep it... Just basically kill a game off and then use it well on the counter-attack. Here's the change. First change for England, quite right Chris Dele Alli, whether he's a striker or not, is actually right away off on the far side of the field. Can you believe that? What a shock. So it's not only the Colombians who know one or two tricks. There you go. And Dele Alli, in no hurry, is doing one of those slow runs off the field. Let's bring Terry Butcher in, because this substitution might take some time, because Dele Alli's going across the shakehands with Jordan Henderson. Yeah, just thinking that, myself and Jordan Henderson, just outnumbered in the middle of the park. England, Harry Kane headed the ball and got headed back over the top of Henderson, and there was the midfield player for Colombia to pick it up, so he just plug in that midfield, two midfield players in there, and I just secured a little bit. It's not sitting back, just making sure that we don't... Just get overrun in the middle of the park. That's a good play by Garas Southgate, I think. Good substitution. Garas Southgate puts his arm around Dele Alli, gives him a pat on the back, and Eric Dyer comes on to play alongside Jordan Henderson in there for the remainder of this game. There are 10 minutes to play. England are winning 1-0. This is BBC Radio 5 Live, live with England at the World Cup, and we are 10 minutes away, also, plus at a time, from seeing England take their place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. Oh, but Kyle Walker's caught in possession on the halfway line by Backer. Backer's off and running. He's going to Caguardo. Caguardo shot his over. He's blazed it over, and that is a big escape for England, after Kyle Walker's mistake. Well, he just sometimes gets caught in possession. He dawdled on the ball, and you can't at this level. Obviously, he's trying to play back to John Stone. He's got a little bit like a concentration, too sloppy. And Caguardo, a good chance. He's got at least at his target, and he's blazed it high and weighed. Columbia, Caguardo should have made England pay for that mistake. Should have. That's a bad miss by Columbia, in every sense. So it's still 1-0 to England, and we are in the 82nd minute. Hang on to your hats, everyone, but here in the car, this will be a tense journey. Sweaty hands on the driving wheel, I suspect. Here's McGuire. McGuire playing the ball back to Tickford. Tickford touch on to his right foot. Tickford, a long fall downfield towards Lindgard. Kane plays it through to Lindgard. Lindgard takes it on to the penalty area, but took a poor touch, actually, and the ball bounce behind, and it's been given as a free kick, actually. It was a bit of a bad touch, and all of us got back there, and Lindgard, as you say, it's a bad touch. He cuts inside, and he's got his eyes. He's just running, and really embarrassed, and he had a real bit of it, which you'd expect. And he gets the free kick. Yeah. 1-0 to England. Gavin Sincenches was being put under pressure by Lindgard. He's trying to hold him off. England are pressing well here. Eric Dyer with a challenge on Uribe. Harry Kane now takes it up, tries to take it on through the middle. He's fouled by Falcao. It's a free kick, good position for England. 8-9 yards forward of the centre-circle. Kane, who has been very closely patrolled this evening. He's taken a few bangs. Harry Kane, England need him fit, but they're going to make further progress at this World Cup. But he's on his feet. The England captain goes scorer again tonight. He's scored in six consecutive England appearances. That's not been done since 1939. And he takes his position. Harry Kane, tall and imposing. Blond hair swept back on the edge of the box. Tripier plays it in, looking for Maguire. Maguire heads it across the face of Gould, and it drops beyond the far post. It's just been a little bit too high, the crosses for a moment. He's really been reaching for a lot. He just can't get up out across the goal, and can't head it down. And Columbia take a goal kick out to Barrios on the edge of the penalty area. Barrios to Mina. And then Quadrado finds Uribe, and Uribe over the halfway line to Bacca. And Bacca now puts in field and plays it into the congested area. The ball looked as though it struck the arm of stones there as it was played forward. But no free kick, and Columbia have the ball again inside their own half. Grassman scores, looking for any little advantage. 84 minutes played. Barrios here to Uribe. Now Mojica, up against Tripier. Mojica tries to go around the outside, and Tripier puts in the challenge. Blocked out of play by Tripier for a throwing. It's going to be a long six minutes, plus added time there. The interest is there, and Stoppaging put on. It's got to be at least five. It's got to be six, seven, eight minutes. Throw in. That was a foul throw. Surely. Halkau plays it back to throwing take a Mojica. Then it's swung in by Contero, headed away by Walker. Comes out for Columbia. Arias, Quadrado has a look up. Here's the delivery from Quadrado. It's headed by Davinson Sanchez, right across the penalty area. And Mojica does very well to keep it in on the slide, actually. Tripier's within, goes for the byline. Gets the cross over to the back post. Falkau stretching over the top of Henderson. Could do nothing other than head it wide of the far post. I thought it was a foul anyway. Referee didn't give any way to see where the ball ended up, which obviously was behind the goal. And actually, Ashley Young and Harry Maguire are actually pulling Jordan Henderson away from the scene of this, just in case it should flare up again and Henderson is on a yellow card. Down to pitch side again, Terry Butcher. Well, that ball was out when it went back out to the touch line. I can see it virtually right along the line. The line's room is hopeless. That ball was out. There should have been an England throw on that left-hand side. Thanks, Terry. Kara Southgate just having a word with Kieran Tripier. 85 minutes played, almost 86. England minutes away from the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 2006. Sweden will be their opponents there. Oh, a stretch for Columbia at the back. And they've just been able to clear it away. Mohica to Davinson Sanchez. And now, Quintero up towards Falkau. Harry Maguire coolly passes it into Eric Dyer. And Jenny Vardy, I see, just down to my right. There's going to be the next England man to come onto the field. Falkau. Columbia have to raise themselves here. They're going out of the World Cup unless they can score a goal. They'll drill the crossfield by Quadrado, but straight onto the head of Harry Kane. Vardy up with Sterling, because they're pushing on his gaps. Vardy can use his pace. You don't have to play here. Any little board, just play one over the top. Yeah, good thinking, that, isn't it? Falkau gets the ball back on his right foot, shoots low. Straight at Pickford, who's able to kill it with his gloves, and then drop onto it. The shot from 22-23 yards. Yeah, I mean, they've improved slightly as they've made the Suggs Columbia, but they don't deserve anything the way they've conduct with themselves and they've been in a food disgrace. This is for their niggly fowls, for their gamesmanship, but it cost them. They ended up conceding the penalty for Carlos Sanchez's wrestling at Harry Kane inside the penalty area. And the Bar video assistant referee confirmed it. We're going to see Vardy come on, but also, as well, for Columbia, Luis Muriel, who there was a thought that he might play. Muriel in the absence of James Rodriguez, as you said, Chris, Raheem Sterling is the England player who will be replaced by Jamie Vardy. He's 25th captainite, Jamie Vardy. And it's Quintero who's off for Columbia. Well, his influence in the second half has been limited, Quintero. Yeah, he kept stretching off. I don't know if he got crumped early in the second half or what, but he just didn't have any movement. Raheem Sterling gets a hug from Garrus Southgate and all of the England staff and their grey tops down to our right. And we have now, we've played 88 minutes, less than two minutes to play, and then it's a matter of how many minutes have been added on, but brace yourselves, because it'll be at least five, six, possibly seven. We've had long, long delays. Ball hooked forward for Columbia, Walker with a header. Then it falls to McGuire, who's able to volley it towards Harry Kane. Kane is tripped and that is disputed by Uribe. It was a foul, though. I don't know what I'm arguing about. Davidson Sanchez was the first foul, and then as Harry Kane takes the ball away, it pulls him down, so it's a foul. England in no hurry to take it. Firing, fire with fire here. Walker, dummies, out-ragiously to take it, but then doesn't. England, in fact, Walker leaves it to Trippia. That'll eat up a few more seconds. We're in the 90th minute now, 1-0 England lead, BBC Five Live, 6-06 to follow. Get your calls in to talk about this. England against Sweden would be the scenario. Not counting any chickens. 08, 085, 909, 693 to talk. Kelly Cates will be hosting from Red Square, Terry Butcher and Chris Sutton, and Chris Waddle all involved. Get in touch at Five Live Sport at BBC 6-06. Throw in for Columbia. Just waiting for that ball to go out with a minute. I don't think the ball's big enough. I think there's space. There could be three, numbers coming off. Three figures, you think. Could be here all night. I think it's five by the looks of it. Five, that's generous to England. Here come Columbia though. The ball's swinging by Mojica, and it's over everyone inside the England penalty area and will bounce out of play into the hoardings. And here now we see the fourth official, the New Zealander, Matt Conga, show everyone only five minutes of added time. And when you consider, as producer Gary handed the note, I think it was three and a half minutes, three and a half minutes between the penalty, the England penalty being awarded and it being taken. We've had all of the other various stoppages. We've had all of the yellow cards. Five minutes. Certainly doesn't add on all of the time. Then there's another foul England's way. And Jordan Henderson is caught again. He's had to spill a bit of blood tonight, Jordan Henderson. And he's still sitting on the pitch. The Colombian fans inside the stadium are enraged. In fact, someone's thrown a plastic cup of drink down from the stands. Doesn't reach the pitch, but there's frustration there. But, you know, they have lived in the stadium. You know, they have lived by the sword, so to speak. And they're dying by the sword. Well, it seems to progress like this. It's part of the tournament. If you're going to lose, yes, you don't like losing. Nobody does, but you can't conduct yourself the way they've done that tonight. We have already had a minute of the five to be played after a bad tempered, niggly, scrappy football match. England are very close now to a place in the quarter-finals. Against Sweden, which will be in Samara on Saturday afternoon. England playing it up to the edge of the penalty area. Davinson Sanchez heads it down. Harry Kane is there. Kane shoulder to shoulder with Arias. Arias gets a touch to it. In fact, it's a free kick given against Harry Kane. And then Harry Kane says the ball is... The free kick's been taken in the wrong place. I was worrying for a moment there that the referee was going to yellow card him. Then, Columbia has stolen five to six yards, more than that. Probably ten yards. He will take it though. Osbina will take it. He hits it long downfield for Columbia. The header is won for England by John Stones. It comes out a peeing shot! What a save by Jordan Pickford! What an effort that was by Uribe from 30 yards plus. And Pickford leaping to his left, got his fingertips to it and preserves England's lead by one hand. I don't know who's going in, John Boy. He didn't know that. Corner to Columbia. This is their first corner of the match. Osbina is coming up. We're in the third minute of added time. So many late goals at this World Cup. England have to defend this set piece. Here's the delivery, which is headed down by Mead O'Rean. Mead O'Rean has scored and he's equalised. And it's 1-1. In the third minute of added time, Columbia have levelled it. And we're heading to extra time. 1-1. What a crushing, crushing blow for England. That quarter-final place has been snatched away for the time being, at least. I can't believe it. They've done their jobs of being good in eight England, well-disciplined, could have played better than I have, but they weren't allowed by a horrible Columbia side. But set piece. And it basically gets above... Oh, he gets above Stones. Stones was marking, he gets above McGuire. And he heads it down, spins up the set. He can't... Chupter on the lane, can't hit it off the lane. Pickford can't reach it. Oh, wow. Not a bad goal to give away. Set piece. England near the threat. Zool too obvious. Yerimina of Barcelona, who's already headed two goals from free kicks, or set pieces at this World Cup. Heads in a third. You put two on him. You know he's the main man who scores. They're still celebrating. I know he's still in the coats somewhere. They're still celebrating. I think he was sitting on the seats, wasn't he? But you know he's the man. So why didn't you put two on him? Two big lads, get on Dave. Enough to hate the team. Make sure he does not head it. Their first corner. They scored from their first corner over there. Like a concentration switched off. And they're still not back over the halfway lane. Just start the match again. I think we go straight to the airport when this finishes. And no plan was there, was there? So 1-1. Colombia won. England won. And we surely will have extra time. England pump it forward. And the ball bounces out of play next to the corner. You know what, John, as well, England's had some great moments in the second half. We're going to kill the game off. You know, Lingards, Sloppy pass. So and so Sloppy pass. They've had great chances to kill this game off. The ball with England on the right. Shibuya says there was a handball there. It's been cleared away downfield. I must say, in extra time here, who knows what's going to happen on the disciplinary front. You know, anything. You see goals, great cards. Don't switch your radio off. Anything's going to happen here. This could be a real thriller. And the atmosphere is brilliant. We're all of those Colombian fans. I think they're just about giving it up. But Mina scores in the third minute of out of time. And it's 1-1. And we've already now had five minutes. Five and a half minutes of out of time. Had five minutes of celebrations. Kane chasing the ball down into the dead ball position. It's headed away by Uribe. Uribe runs out to Daya. Daya lifted over the top. I thought that was a handball just outside the penalty area. But it's not. Then Maguire tests it down. Maguire's going to carry the ball forward. Tries to slip it through. But it's sliced away by Arias. Falcao gets a touch against Ashley Young. Ashley Young then falls into the path of Falcao. No free kick given because Colombia have the advantage with Cuadrado. Then Young puts in the challenge. And there's no free kick. He wasn't able to bring it back, the referee. But it's a way downfield. Six minutes of out of time. That's it. The final whistle goes. It is 1-1. And we will have extra time. And Yari Mina is headed. The 93rd minute has salvaged it. For the time being at least after Harry Kane with the penalty. They gave England the lead. And now England has got the dig deep again. So Colombia won. England won. And the penalty is over. They have a good hitting. It's just down to our right here. He looks as though he's enjoying it. Colombia are going to get the second. Get the first period of extra time underway. So now England have got to respond. One of those moments where that's when the manager, Harris Southgate, Steve Holland and his team can do their work. That's when they have to rebuild the belief. No further substitutions. No further substitutions. No further substitutions. Remember, each team can make an extra substitution in extra time. England have only used two so far. Chris Waddle. They have a 4 to put Quadrado in midfield. They are playing back now on the right. Yari will be on the left. So they are playing basically a 4-3-3. Their toes are up a bit now. They have got a bit of the crowds up. They have got that goal. England has got to stay calm and use the ball well. Peckford, who made a brilliant save. To keep it at 1-0. But then Columbia scored from the result in corner. There is Barrios and Jung going for a 50-50 together. And the whole of the Colombian bench have stepped forward because it happened in between the referee and the bench, clearly trying to influence the referee. Jung went into the challenge. Barrios is still on the ground. Well, he has caught him. Jung did catch him. He knows if he stands up, he's off. Jung did catch him. But he has gone in too footed. I wouldn't be surprised if that is shown. If that is referred. Jung is still on the ground. There is no indication that that is going to go to the video assistant referee. Look at that bench as well. England's bench. Look, can't see anybody. The whole squad, everybody is on the touchline. Telling it to referee. Jung's out there. He's got the ball. Jung's okay. He's on his feet. I think he might have feared the worst there, Ashley Jung. No action taken. Jung with the free kick. Hits it high into the Colombian penalty area. That's one area lead. One well actually as well. By goal scorer Nina. And now, Colombia are breaking away downfield of the left-hand side. And fortunately for England, they have a little bit of cramp from across and dis-possess. And then God must have run 50 yards here. Got a little bit of cramp. So now, Colombia have the ball. England have the ball. In front of their own penalty area. Colombia playing with Bacca out towards the right-hand side. Halkow through the middle. John Stones in possession of the ball. England were winning 1-0 right until the 93rd minute when Yeri Nina headed the equaliser from a corner. Hard to work out with Colombia's playing. They've got a 4. They've got a 5. Very hard to work out with the playing. Bacca does seem to have come out to the right. Cuerrado is coming to the right now. And we've got 3.5. Cuerrado wins the header. Henderson gets there ahead of Bacca. Bacca's ball. Eric Dyer in with a challenge. That's a foul. Eric Dyer led with his shoulder. Free kick to Colombia. This is right in the balance. Bacca still on the ground. Hasn't got up yet. And the possibility of penalties obviously is now back on the agenda. Extra time. It is since the World Cup in 1966. This is now 8 of 15 World Cup knockout matches involving England that have gone to extra time. 8 out of 15. There is a trend there. The crows right behind them. All around the stadium. Supporters in Colombia's shirts are on their feet. Waving their flags and their shirts. The England supporters heavily outnumbered. And the atmosphere is strongly backing the South American team. One won the score. Bacca is OK. Ball swung out towards the right here for Colombia. He's headed away by Yung. He's headed straight to Cuadrado. He has Arias behind him. Back to Cuadrado. Back into his own half towards Colombia's goal scorer, Mina. Now across to Devenson Sanchez. Now to the left-hand side. Mojica goes for the early ball to the edge of the box. Stones. Readjusts, plays it away. Now Colombia comes through the middle with Falcao. Stones in with a challenge. But Stones continued his run. Was able to take the ball, run it away and pass it out of play down the right. And suddenly, Colombia are the team that we from an England point of view feared they might be tonight. Yeah, they look a little bit tired now and Colombia's getting tired on the ball. We know they can play. They haven't showed much of it today. Throw in Cuadrado. He's going to take it short. Now he's winding himself up. Once the run to the near post. Flick Don has gone a long way and it's hooked away by Lingard on the edge of the box. Bounces out of play for a throw on the pass. It's a little bit naive. You know it's coming at the box. Get one in front so it doesn't come through. There's no danger then. First man, Clearsie. There's a lot of tired legs out there. And Muriel, Luis Muriel, who's on the left-hand side. The severe man, he is a danger. So there's front line for Colombia. Muriel on the left, Falcao through the middle and Baccar on the right. Muriel down the left-hand side. It's taken on. A low cross to the near post. Pickford slides in and Pickford gathers it. Falcao is in there as well. Thought for a moment. It's Baccar who is going to get there first. He's back up. Slid in didn't he? Nearly got a touch on it. England. One-one. Obviously that was a blow. That was a severe blow that England took. And they haven't really recovered properly yet. Colombia are on top. As Chris Waddle says, their tails are up. 6-0-6 will follow. Events are over here in the Spartak Moscow stadium. Lines are open. 08, 08, 09, 09, 06, 09, 03. Eric Dias carrying the ball forward. Dias runs into yellow shirts and Colombia have it back. And now Lingard comes across. But it's played back by Muriel. Back into central. It's changed Johnny. Got one more sub left, haven't it? To put someone in and create something. We can make Nicky a goal. Like Rashford. Can he create it? Or do you just leave it? England have two actually. Two subs left. He can use it. One extra. He puts someone in with a bit of energy. Create something. That's a big problem in the squad. We haven't really got a great player. Colombia with the ball. Quadrado plays it up the Falcao. Who just scoops it out of play. So we'll bring in Terry Butcher from down at pitch level again. Terry. Marcus Rashford just warming up right in the corner. The end that Jordan Pickford is in goal. Just getting warmed up. He's not very energetic. And he's warmed up enough. So he's not going to come on just yet. But that's an option. If England want to really go for it and play three forwards. Unless you want to take Harry Kane off. I don't think you'll do that. The ball's off the field. Young's taking the throw. Maguire was looking the other way. And the referee has stopped play. They're putting the net by back out. But the referee had already blown the whistle. This was total confusion here. Because the ball was thrown on the pitch. There were two balls on the pitch. Ashley Young was waiting to take a throw. Harry Maguire knew there was a ball on the field. Turned his back. The ball was cleared off the field. Young took the throw while Harry Maguire was expecting that ball to be used for the throw. Look at that, by the way. Just a little. Because there was only one ball in play when the throw was taken by Ashley Young. There was confusion there. And that could have turned out very embarrassingly for Harry Maguire. But Maguire brings the ball forward. The score is still 1-1 in the first period of extra time here in Moscow. Vardy back towards Kane. Kane lifts it over the top through the middle. But beyond anyone in the red shirt. Don't force it. You've got Kerr-Walker to the right. Another pass out of Trippia. Me at these run, there's a lot of tail legs. Make them work. Spina still has the ball. And we've already had eight minutes of this first period of extra time. There's been so much talk, Chris, of penalties again. All year, really. I can't believe it's 1-1. I just cannot believe it. And we might be having the penalties again. Tickford out of his penalty area. They've done so much work. Gareth Southgate and his staff are trying to improve England's penalty record. But let's not get ahead of ourselves on that one. Because we still have... That's in the wrong one. Here is Clevenson Sanchez for Columbia. The way that the game is at the moment, it's entirely possible that Columbia could take a lead in this match. England are looking a little flat. And I think that thinking about making a change, John Stone's heading the ball away. I thought Bakker used his arm there. No three kick-givens. Taken on by Uribe, who is running across from left to right. But then Ashley Young is able to play the ball into Uribe out of play. They've got that late equaliser, John. They've got that extra bit of energy. And England look flat. Columbia won England 1. I think it's Danny Rose, you know. Yeah, Danny Rose is the one who's going to be called forward first. And remember, Ashley Young's still limping. Columbia can make one more change. England can make two more changes. Ball with Maguire. And then Dyer drops deep. Here's Young back to Dyer. I think it's fast for Young. He doesn't look care-right where he's walking. He's got a slight limp there. And there's no hot-bait. Stones, passes it up towards Lingard. But Lingard was beaten to it. And now Falcao plays it to the left-hand side and Luis Muriel is taking it on. Luis Muriel back onto his right foot. He has support behind him. And Mojica rolls it all the way back towards the halfway line. Now it finds its way over here to the right-hand side. To Arias. Arias pushes it off to Quadrado. Quadrado, that's a good-looking delivery. And it's headed down, but well-wide of the goal. Well-wide of the goal. Horner from back up. And it did take an afflection in. There's a corner to Columbia. Danger here, then, for England. Columbia scored from their only previous corner in the match. I'll put two on him, mate. Put two on him. Don't let him have it. Don't let him have it. Corner to be taken again by Quadrado. This is the old routine. Everyone knows about it here at the World Cup. But stopping it has proved impossible. Falcao is pulling Davinson Sanchez away from the England defence. Here's the delivery towards Mina. And it's headed wide by Davinson Sanchez, who actually got in the way of Mina. Headed it wide. That was good news. He got in the way. He has the substitution. And it is Ashley Young being replaced by Danny Rose. Terry Butcher. Yeah, well, the corner came over. I watched Mina because he's marked by Harry McGuire. And he goes back, right in the back post, well past the back post. As the delivery is coming in, it's an out-swinger. He then goes towards the palace, but away from goal, loses Harry McGuire. And, unfortunately, one of his players gets in the way. Doesn't get a clean header, but flashes it wide. I think Chris is right. They've got to put two men in one in front, one slightly behind. You try and squeeze him out of that space because he is a real, real danger. Columbia won, England won. As Ashley Young is embraced by Garrel Southgate, who slaps him on the back, and Danny Rose steps into this World Cup round of 16 match. To win his 21st cap. Chris, England brought on Jamie Vardy in the latter parts of the match. No. They'd love to have Rashford on the field, wouldn't they? I would rather have Rashford on, but Jamie Vardy was brought on because they were throwing everything at England, Columbia, and there was space. And you thought, well, with a counterattack ideal for Vardy, one ball, he's down the side, he's away. England scored, now they've dropped off defensively. Vardy's got no space. And the Ains, yes, in Ainside, Rashford would have been a better change. But this can still make one change. I would look at it, because if you want to go in the game, a minute, there's a lot of tail legs out there. Columbia's being spread on by this crowd, which is a lot of yellow shirts. Another free kick. Free kick, we are in the 13th minute of the first period of extra time. The 103rd minute of this match. Columbia won, England won, and a free kick after Mojica was bundled over by Lingard, which is one of the England players on a yellow card in this match, Lingard and Henderson. One-one. Columbia being loudly back by their many thousands of supporters here in Moscow. And here they are with the ball on the left-hand side, Mojica with a cross, Falka with a header, but he's headed it wide. He was in between McGuire and Stones, and he headed it wide, and he holds his head. It's all about who has come out, or has in Columbia, who have sort of up the gears. England have come right off the pace. It's not one or two plays, it's about a nine have come right off the pace. And Arrimeguia giving credit, just puts Falka off, if he goes ahead just nudges him, and he heads it wide, but it's all Columbia at the minute. Columbia won, England won, this is all happening, England, depending at your end Cross KML couldn't watch where Falco's header went because the England back three all over the shop Falco gets in between John Stones and Harry McGuire. John Stones doesn't do anything about it. Harry McGuire comes across too late. Free header. He's a small man Falco. If he puts that on target that could have been 2-1 They've got a the concentration levels got to be higher. It's got to be higher. Do you know what I say the Italian it went? When you're tired concentration levels drop And there's a lot of tired mains out and legs out there Yeah, but the one the team with the most concentration will win this match because we know that and it's got to be It's got to be It doesn't look like it was at the minute No, Terry Vulture and Chris Waddle with us on five live World Cup semi-finalists with England both And now England were seconds away really from a quarter-final here in Russia Now suddenly the semi-final possibility of that feels like a long way away One won the score and Columbia sweeping forward again in the yellow shirts back I turns and gives it to Falco who's on his left foot outside the D He gives it to Mojica on the left hand side yellow shirts are plenty in the box Oh, that's an awful cross from Mojica and it bounces straight out of play beyond everyone and Falco puts his hands on his hips in the penalty area in desperation Do you want to know themselves? They didn't leave 12 on did they come beyond? They just seem to be dominating the game in England just have got where's everybody gone This is all what he gets on the ball apart on the back three and they're giving it away cheaply But mean as equalizer was was a real stunning blow that that flawed England and lifted Columbia so much and then a crossfield pass straight out of play from Eric Dyer throwing to Columbia half way inside their own half for an added time at the end of the first period of extra time I Pacaman the coach who led Columbia to the quarter finals four years ago in Brazil when they when they did so well and Entertain us so much walk out under pressure from Muriel Now trip yet back to walk out England don't want to make mistakes here and then trip He has actually been caught late by Muriel who is Stalked across and is leaning over trip. Yeah, and it's obviously giving him a piece of his mind Kiran Trippier gets up and he's smiling at him Yeah, he is but it just shows you didn't touch him and did he look he doesn't so He's rolling around Trippie has made and we did we did all that teams out. That's terrible Free kick to England pick fit to hit it downfield Whistle will be going very shortly as Vardy heads the ball on Straight through for a little kick and that is half time in extra time Columbia one England one and let's bring Mark Chapman in again At the moment with England You think now they almost would take penalties Because Columbia are on top and they've just gone into a huddle England have been ready for some little while and noticed that Hamas Rodriguez actually who's not involved injured not involved tonight has Actually came on to the field and joined in and in the goal to our right at Terry's end one of the assistants I don't know whether some netting had come loose, but they seem to Be giving that some attention and putting that right Chris Waddle Just as I said, I'm looking for England yet to turn raise the tempo Got 15 minutes they can still win the game in this team But we've got to pick it up They've just dropped right off the pace and the letting come from the acumen to them Kane heads it down to Lingard Lingard hits the shot Henderson talks it forward chance for Vardy Shoot straight at Osbina and he was in an offside position good start simple kickoff back to John Stones long bit of panic there in the Columbian defense drops to Vardy. Yeah, and he's a good yard two yards offside Hit it straight at Osbina took it well to his left actually just just to his left catch Columbia one England one So first minute of the second period of extra time Columbia The best period of the match was in that first 15 minutes of extra time having scored the equalizer in the third minute I've added time at the end of the 90 Muriel over hits the ball down the left straight out of play Mujica can't keep it in throwing to England England all in red They're playing from left to right now in this period of extra time Columbia yellow shirts with the blue and red Columbian trim The throwing taken by Trippier and Stones played it back to him. That's and they've conceded a free kick That's a bad air out in throwing throwing rather. That's a bad error Like a concentration that is symptomatic of the way that England are just now. They're in trouble here England throwing taken and Mojica takes it on down the left-hand side Columbia have new energy in this match Uribe Plays it back towards Davinson Sanchez Quadrados available on the far side if they want to use him Davinson Sanchez passes it forward to Daya Daya got a foot in Kane will play it over the top for Vardy to chase stretched by Davinson Sanchez to get his head to it Right idea Arias to Osbina who's able to control it on his right foot falls as he clears it Kane's giving it back to Lingard Goldstitch go keep us still on the ground Vardy could be in shot is blocked by Barry or so did a great job actually to cover Jamie Vardy and block his shot from the angle. I don't know what Jamie Vardy had in his mind He didn't know where the cross is or shoot and he made the wrong decision But also how long did it take David Osbina to get back into his goal? Ball played over the top by Bacca and this is for Falcao to chase but Pickford got there first outside the penalty area Planted it into the stand Stalker maybe looking about stones is become a liability at the minute and We'll be looking at that. He's the spearman at the back in the middle England something away Danny Rose the substitute Jamie Vardy plays it around the defender But plays it's played out of play John Stones has become a liability Well, he's give the ball away there Falco got ahead of him in the box that way. He's had a word with him in the Change around there is fall asleep as a board gets played over the top pick that comes out and clear as it Garry Southgate and Steve Hollander in discussions together just in front of the blue top England dugout down to our right the score Columbia 1 England 1 penalties are Approaching they are 12 minutes away England who've lost six out of seven penalty shootouts World Cup and European Championship finals over the years throwing for Columbia and Rebate plays it through the inside left position, but couldn't find the ball to Muriel and Pickford has it in his hands I don't know if start keeping in now about mistakes and You know anything can happen is to say or there's a seven eight minutes left Back in your World Cup famously at this stage of the competition England won against Belgium with a very late goal in extra time scored by David Platt England are up against it here now in this match as it's sent forward towards Jamie Vardy Meena missed his clearance and was rather fortunate there that he got a second chance But he took a second chance up towards Falco. That's a lurking danger if ever I saw one Falco Also ball forward from Barry Ross and now Vardy chases a ball down the left-hand side takes on me That's Vardy using his pace story might have been tripped there by Arias. Nope. No free kick given So Columbia are in possession Vardy pulls himself back to his feet All up towards Falco. That's one by Harry Maguire in the air Lingard heads it on Hedder Henderson little header back towards Lin guard now Kyle Walker We'll take it on over the halfway line for England Walker stands up with the challenge Walker then throws himself to the ground Crump and has cramped Throwing to Columbia the referee just checking with Kyle Walker Columbia putting the ball out of play so it can bring in Terry Butcher again Terry Marcus Rashford again 15 yards away from in the corner and I think they'll be looking at a substitution there Maybe go to a back four and bring on Rashford We've got the two strikers of course with Kane and with Vardy maybe Rashford on the left-hand side of midfield In that four, but then they might do that to try and just tighten things up as and just have another body in there Another attacking body in there as well. Yeah, there is one way as Lindar plays it to Kane and then Kane slips a ball forward to Vardy who crosses Would took it a flexion and went a long way the Barrios was able to Half-full it out of play for a throw down the left Columbia have come off the pace now I think they're feeling it pace-wise and England's starting to come back into the game It's 1-1 BBC 5 lives 6 0 6 to follow oh 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 England with Maguire Maguire through to Lin guard It's bangstoff Lin guard It's rattling around on the edge of the Colombian penalty area and then Muriel comes out with the ball England could be stretched here, but stones is able to step forward and just pass it away to Jordan Henderson Henderson going around the outside of Muriel down the left and then Muriel recovers and slides in good challenge puts it out for a Throw to England Who have found a little bit of extra gas in the tank? Yeah, I think Columbia has come off the pace as well, so Could be a few more mistakes 111 minutes have been played of the 120 still won one Daya with a high ball out towards Henderson on the far side back to Danny Rose puts his foot on it Henderson Maguire is there and Maguire will carry the ball forward towards the edge of the penalty area But his past is deflected away by Barry Ospin back to the red shirts of England Whistles from the Colombian fans inside the stadium here because it is England who are just beginning to move into the ascendancy again Deepen extra time Rose Rose will now latch onto a ball and shoot right across the face of goal and beyond the far post What a great move a great run by Danny Rose that says a lot of tail eggs out there He's a suburbs come on you should have a lot of energy Drills that across as a slight deflection. I thought they always give a goal kick Marcus Rashford is being spoken to at length by Garret Southgate here Garret Southgate was standing in front of him with his hands on the top of his shoulders talking directly into his face and now Rashford comes up And he will be coming on to replace Kyle Walker who was struggling with cramp Well, yeah struggling badly dial go to a right side of the three Eric Dyer has dropped back in there that was always going to be an option for England Marcus Rashford strength sprints onto the field. That's what's going in midfield with Anderson and Lindon Rashford to the left hand side Talks to Jordan Henderson still So Rashford who we saw it right wing back didn't we against Belgium in the In the last group match Rashford In another unfamiliar position and that's it That is the end of the Substitutions or actually not in Columbia have won more if they want to use it Columbia won England won And we have less than seven minutes to go before penalties penalties at a World Cup involving England Here's Vardy though Vardy on to the ball down the right crosses to the near post a touch by Lindon But a blocking save by the sliding Barrios to put it wider than the approach more like Jamie Vard He is he runs down the channel put spins out his right hand side Lot of tail legs and that defense great first touch and a lovely early ball in Oh and in God's kind of going to touch on it, but I've got a corner which there always carry a threat carry a threat from a corner England We know that no team at this World Cup has scored more goals from set pieces than Garo Southgate's England team Columbia did it to them Can England do it to Columbia here? It is on the chances headed over the top? I think it was Eric Dyer who was in there clear header Seven yards out and he had it over the top right in front of Terry butcher Yeah, he didn't get up early enough Eric Dyer good ball in over the top of the first man Just over the top of the first man didn't get up above the ball So they therefore he hits the ball underneath and over the crossbar. What's a chance that was what a chance any any header on target And that's two one and just when it seemed Chris Waddle that England Were right up against it. They've rallied in this second period of extra time and have created enough chances to have won it Yeah, they have they've a second period of extra time. They're on top there goodness come right off the pace The crowd's gone quiet as well, which is good. They're going to change their right back That's the final change that Columbia are making there their permitted fourth substitution in extra time Arias is going to be replaced by the AC Milan Defender Christian Zapata Very played for AC Milan this season. I think Arias might be another one who is just struggling a little After these almost 120 minutes of intense effort So that is it for the substitutions We have less than five minutes to play and then it'll be penalties England Have been involved in three penalty shootouts at World Cups Lost them all if you know your football you can probably reel them off Here's Kane in the center circle Kane looks to his left Harry Kane to Lin guard Lin guard with a flick Kane takes it on for he might have been blocked there But no free kick and Columbia coming forward all of these Colombian supporters Raise their sound level as Columbia passed the halfway line now on the left-hand side Mokica back it goes though into central defense to Davinson Sanchez and Barry Ross Barry Ross flicks the pass to the right-hand side Zapata the newly arrived Zapata gives it to quadrado quadrados ball in towards Falco He's headed across his own penalty area by Daya It's given us a goal kick and that was a clear deflection off the head of Daya And it's given us a goal kick Falco is nowhere near that by the way unless he thinks nobody touched it Well, that's what they must think. Yeah, he thinks nobody's touched it. He's given a goal kick That's an escape England don't want to face another Colombian corner one won the score came clicks ahead or on looking for Vardy but cleared away by Davinson Sanchez who's had an excellent game actually Davinson Sanchez and then Down goes this time Muriel only a slight touch from trivia no free-kick given I think the referee might finally have got wise to it So he took them up 170 minutes not barred up We're into the final two minutes Oh Danny Rose is taken out by quadrado. That's an awful challenge. It was late I think Rose has just been able to reveal it But if if he'd made contact there on Danny Rose that could have been nasty Yellow card for quadrado silly challenge because England are very dangerous. It's that pieces improved all night That's the sixth Colombian player to be booked Free kick then for England Danny Rose Took no hurt from that challenge and it will be Danny Rose to swing in this free kick for England late in extra time Rose's delivery. Oh, Spina comes for it and gets a fingertip to it to deflect it away Out for a throw in or Spina No, you're not believe this or Spina has stayed down again. Which was a game. He kept falling down Poland was it? Think it was or was it was Poland? I think yes He's on his feet again Throw in we're now in the 119th minute Penalties Approaching Thrain for England tripier into the box clicked on by McGuire whacked away for Columbia by Mina England have left the big man up So Rashford playing the ball to trippier Trippier now to John Stones on the halfway line England. We've got to be careful here. Stones is carefully Last five minutes to me face is used the ball very very well again had a shaky Shaggy period long ball from Tickford. That's headed away by quadrado was allowed to bounce by Henderson in the center circle and then wins the bouncing ball against Radamel Falcao We are now in the 120th minute It looks like it's going to be penalties Stones and Henderson and now Rashford Rashford on his right foot He's up against Barrios. So he plays it out here to the right-hand side to Trippier Trippier's ball forward has been charged down by Muriel and Mohica it is actually and the ball bounces off him out of play for When I rush on this on this it's going to take your time I think they've accepted Grumbert it's going to go it will shoot out Throw in Mohica to take it Just watching a replay Harry McGuire placed a hand on Osbina And Osbina collapsed to the ground Balls out of play for a throw. That's it one minute of added time. We have 60 seconds Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls late in the evening in Moscow We are one minute away from a penalty shootout Between England and Columbia for a place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup I think my heart rate's just increased insane those worlds Wacked across field by Mohica might be a chance to win it yet final ball into the box by Quadradole to the edge of the area stones wins ahead of comes out to Mohica Mohica Up against Trippier Trippier tries to recover Mohica's gone past him and then fell over and the balls behind Goal kick That's gonna be it. It's got to be it now, isn't it? 20 seconds here 20 seconds away. He's not there. He can't kick the long way Pickled with a goal kick I Smashing it down the middle Onto the head of Kane who tries to head it on that is beaten by Sanchez and that's it That's it England's first match in the knockout stage at this World Cup ends in a 1-1 draw Columbia won England won after extra time And you know what that means it's penalties for England at a World Cup You're right Yeah, I could understand your nerves I was checking John more you are you gonna have to loosen your cagoo Can't have my game can it I Think we should just run through Exactly how bad England's record is for those who don't know England have been involved in seven penalty shootouts at either a World Cup or a European Championship Tournament finals. They've lost six of the seven at World Cups. They've been involved in three They've lost all three Germany 1990 to Argentina in 98 to Portugal in 2006, but Penalties are something that the Garos Southgate identified The FA have identified it. They've used all sorts of methods as much as you can They have tried to encourage England to slow down and to to be more deliberate not to hurry their penalties They found that England on average took their penalties much more quickly than other teams take their penalties They've been involved in other little games as well putting competitions in a penalty style a Lot of work has gone into this but at the end Chris it comes down to 12 yards of all a man and a goalkeeper that it's it more when they were tired and mentally tired Probably not and when they walk up there now You don't do that in training morning training, but there's no crowd and it's not all yellow behind the goal Well both of the matches that we've covered in the last 16 Chris have gone to penalties It was great fun wasn't it the other day you and I watching Spain and Russia what a luck that was This feels rather different Columbia are going to take their penalties first This for a place in the quarterfinal against Sweden on Saturday afternoon Jordan Pickford this mobile Everton goalkeeper with an excellent record of saving penalties at under 21 level for England as well He's excelled himself and it's Radamel Falcao who's going to take the first one So Columbia will take the penalties first in the end to our left Thousands of day in Colombians behind that goal Jordan take foot on his line Radamel Falcao the Colombian captain right-footed drives it down the middle high past pick for who died to his left Fine penalty one nail Columbia Gotta say 20 minutes or plus a football Banges straight down the middle laces straight down the middle pick that goes to his right. Yep Very good. So David Ospina of Arsenal takes his place in the goal And the Arsenal man turns round and sees a Tottenham man the England captain Harry Kane Preparing to take England's first penalty Kane who scored Three penalties at this World Cup already including one here tonight past Ospina last one went down the middle What about this one from the England captain? Harry Kane up to the ball right-footed drives it low and in and each one one class pen Brilliant. I came pens and he's fantastic at one He went low but he went right into the bottom corner as Ospina dived the right way down to his right But he couldn't keep it out next It is quadrado who is stepping up to the ball another of the experienced men the Juventus midfielder One quadrado with that shock of black hair one one in the penalty shootout Quadrado right footed again here we go high another excellent penalty for Columbia above pictures dive to his right To one Columbia high standard that was class as well wasn't it a pace he put on now That's a bit like a hurry came on Well, it is going to be Marcus Rashford Mark Chapman's just Deliver that news that he's never taken a penalty at senior level and here he is now In a World Cup penalty shootout I feel nervous for him Rashford 20 years old It's a direct it's a straight run up And he's ready now He moves round to his left and then up to the ball and he hits it firmly and powerfully Past Ospina's dive to his right and he trots away as though but that wouldn't melt in his mouth one one well done Marcus Rashford, you know young man like that goes up brilliant lot of pressure Brilliant well done Next for Columbia, I think it's Muriel is this It's going to win Well Somebody is going to be having a wig after this one Columbia or England full penalties taken four penalties converted and Luis Muriel of Syria Is standing behind the line of the ball and moves to his left and up to the ball and he rolls it in Very cool. He take and this one was stroked away. Pickford went down to his right the little jump of joy from him Three two Columbia Very good again a standard. It could be all night Henderson next for England Jordan Henderson the Liverpool captain England's effective vice captain Up to the ball receives it from Jordan pick but actually who comes across and passes it to Henderson who juggles with it and Then places the ball exactly where he wants it and takes three four five six Strides back and to the left Henderson three two Columbia in the shootout Jordan Henderson stands Here he goes Jordan Henderson One handed by a spinner and it's advantage Columbia in the World Cup penalty shootout So everybody's woke up and Jordan Henderson jogged up as if he wanted to take it so quick and get it out the way and As he ran up he wanted to sort of rushed it in my eyes And it was a great save don't want his wrong to his left An excellent save full length to his left Was it Packham and the Columbia coach 60 years old he can't look he's got his hand over his face An England now three two down. This is a rebate who's going to take this we'll read a Jordan pickford needs to do an auspina Rebe This is a short run up He's ready here. He comes just a couple of strides and he's hit the crossbar and it's bounced out And That back on level terms Yep, but level Well, they'll be back level if you score as long as England score. Yes, you're a two Columbia You're right now the nerves are coming in now. Is it trip yet? Yeah? Yeah, the nerves are going in now When you get the words up fifth one Speaking from experience It's three two the last two have been missed one saved by a spinner who rebate hit the crossbar And a rebate has just been welcomed back Into the center circle consoling arms and handshakes here in Trippia then for England next this to make it three three And each will have taken four penalties Here in Trippia must score this Excellent penalty swept it right for it high up to our spinners right and into the net So it is now back all square three three So we are now effectively southern Beth Chris Waddle in the penalty shootout. You've been here in the World Cup This is why this was yet You feel for that there's a lot of pressure when you walk up there like that No, you know people have missed and as you say John it's sudden death Bacca Carlos Bacca the 31 year old Been on loan at Villareal. That's a female and not sure if he's a penalty taker by the He's ready now standing feet apart Still standing still waiting and back a right-footed up he comes And pick that strike suppose he punches the air he crawls his fist and it's advantage England now And Eric Dyer will walk forward and if Eric Dyer scores this England have won a World Cup penalty shootout Whisper it quietly Gareth Southgate Who himself missed the crucial penalty for England in the Euro 96 semi-final watches on? Jordan Pickford can hardly contain himself. This is the moment. This is the moment for England This could be a winning moment in a penalty shootout at a World Cup. We've never witnessed this before Eric Dyer has the responsibility It's Tottenham against Arsenal Dyer against our Spina Shootout for the first time in a World Cup They're through to the quarterfinals off they go to celebrate and finally finally finally this jinx is broken Columbia are out England are through They've done it all of that work that they put into penalty shootouts Whether it had any bearing or not. Well, who knows the fact is England have won a penalty shootout at a World Cup glory glory being
