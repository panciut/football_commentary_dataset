[0.00 - 4.72] P:1684.52 E:0.043752 |  And just before we get underway, Alan Shearer, just your thoughts, just before kick-off.
[4.72 - 9.16] P:1719.27 E:0.106953 |  Oh, that's not weird. I want England to show real intent right from the first off.
[9.16 - 13.36] P:1726.21 E:0.095884 |  I want to see energy, I want to see them try again and push high up the pitch
[13.36 - 18.00] P:1720.96 E:0.092382 |  and press out the pitch and show the Dutch that they're in for one LLB game tonight.
[18.00 - 22.80] P:1703.56 E:0.103395 |  And the World Service join us as England kick-off here in Dortmund
[22.80 - 27.72] P:1672.00 E:0.087487 |  in the second European Championship semi-final of the tournament.
[27.84 - 31.08] P:1659.55 E:0.093467 |  For the right to play Spain in Berlin on Sunday night.
[31.08 - 34.80] P:1741.22 E:0.090294 |  England fire it forward towards Harry Kane and the captain with the heaviest touch.
[34.80 - 40.28] P:1824.86 E:0.104717 |  Gatbal then collides with Walker and the much-talked-about German referee Felix Speyer.
[40.28 - 42.20] P:1682.95 E:0.081785 |  That's dominated the headlines this week.
[42.20 - 44.88] P:1745.62 E:0.091981 |  He gives an early free kick the way of the Dutch.
[44.88 - 45.92] P:1794.43 E:0.102238 |  Carroll's Southgate last night.
[45.92 - 49.36] P:1667.36 E:0.098875 |  I actually saw him greet the referee and the officials down in the tunnel area.
[49.36 - 52.44] P:1618.26 E:0.098715 |  It was all smiles, happiness, very, very friendly.
[52.44 - 54.88] P:1597.53 E:0.099651 |  I'm not sure that's going to be an issue tonight, Alan.
[55.00 - 56.20] P:1714.67 E:0.092731 |  It shouldn't be an issue.
[56.20 - 58.52] P:1630.96 E:0.117596 |  The players wouldn't want to get into entertaining that
[58.52 - 60.72] P:1546.18 E:0.104685 |  and certainly Gareth wouldn't want to either.
[60.72 - 63.00] P:1722.54 E:0.106448 |  It was always going to be all smiles if he did see him.
[63.00 - 64.28] P:1346.44 E:0.112014 |  Well, quite so.
[64.28 - 67.12] P:1651.42 E:0.113288 |  So the Dutch with the ball on the edge of the wrong pad at the area.
[67.12 - 72.24] P:1550.95 E:0.102640 |  These two very experienced central defenders Van Dijk and De Vrij.
[72.24 - 74.32] P:1722.54 E:0.094177 |  Both 32 years old.
[74.32 - 77.48] P:1585.18 E:0.107388 |  Van Dijk is just won the title again with Inter in Italy.
[77.48 - 79.40] P:1444.19 E:0.105703 |  Now he has done three on the right-hand side.
[79.40 - 81.32] P:1702.82 E:0.103105 |  Hits a long pass for Marl into chase.
[81.32 - 86.28] P:1873.61 E:0.097320 |  But he just dropped too early and the offside flag was up.
[86.28 - 89.00] P:1791.06 E:0.091634 |  I'm not sure he would have reached it anyway, but it's a free kick to England.
[89.00 - 92.12] P:1832.68 E:0.103334 |  Just looking at the system, it's pretty much what we expected.
[92.12 - 94.24] P:1773.39 E:0.108977 |  You can see when the Dutch had the ball there
[94.24 - 97.16] P:1669.20 E:0.094179 |  and Saka taking his right-wing back position up
[97.16 - 98.76] P:1552.12 E:0.095407 |  and helping his defenders out.
[99.88 - 103.12] P:1601.74 E:0.108877 |  So England's infosession in front of their own penalty area.
[103.12 - 106.96] P:1642.46 E:0.098233 |  England who have never reached a final on foreign soil.
[107.88 - 110.92] P:1457.80 E:0.106485 |  And here we are in a semi-final with England for the third time.
[111.56 - 115.44] P:1504.33 E:0.101732 |  In the four major tournaments that Gareth Southgate has been the manager for.
[115.44 - 118.44] P:1568.95 E:0.098969 |  Actually, if you had the Nations League back in 2019
[118.44 - 120.92] P:1659.27 E:0.102704 |  when they lost to the Netherlands, it's four semi-finals.
[120.92 - 122.68] P:1776.31 E:0.102680 |  England with Walker, heavy touch.
[122.68 - 124.92] P:1801.28 E:0.109071 |  Walker though just touches it past Gakpo.
[124.92 - 126.96] P:1760.14 E:0.104806 |  Now Saka in field to Menu.
[126.96 - 129.20] P:1697.49 E:0.103482 |  Menu then, little ball to his left.
[129.20 - 131.52] P:1626.23 E:0.107810 |  Tud Balingam just dwelt on it.
[131.52 - 135.56] P:1507.57 E:0.096995 |  And as a result, he was closed down by Siemens.
[135.56 - 139.28] P:1565.71 E:0.107384 |  And now Declan Rice is able to muscle his way ahead of Marlon.
[139.28 - 140.76] P:1589.12 E:0.109374 |  And England have got possession back.
[140.76 - 143.16] P:1580.88 E:0.102533 |  And what is currently a dry evening here,
[143.16 - 145.72] P:1461.96 E:0.092458 |  it's nothing like as warm as it was last night.
[145.72 - 148.16] P:1544.16 E:0.095294 |  The thunderstorms have just eased the temperatures.
[148.16 - 151.88] P:1548.21 E:0.101448 |  But we have had some very heavy showers in the build-up to kick off.
[151.88 - 154.80] P:1700.72 E:0.103697 |  So, John Stones.
[154.80 - 157.24] P:1694.53 E:0.110701 |  John Stones just bringing the ball forward.
[157.24 - 161.16] P:1452.43 E:0.105340 |  Stones tonight, winning his 78th cap,
[161.16 - 163.72] P:1456.78 E:0.107224 |  which brings him level with two of the fine defenders,
[163.72 - 166.12] P:1419.85 E:0.099087 |  Stuart Pierce and John Terry.
[166.12 - 168.84] P:1419.96 E:0.103120 |  And now he's won ahead of the great Terry Butcher.
[168.88 - 170.72] P:1596.97 E:0.108979 |  Here is Rice on the halfway line.
[170.72 - 174.04] P:1401.18 E:0.095368 |  Declan Rice just takes it on a little further.
[174.04 - 176.56] P:1378.74 E:0.101057 |  Then there's a first touch over there on the far side from Tripp yet.
[176.56 - 179.04] P:1340.81 E:0.099046 |  Comes back in field towards the 19-year-old.
[179.04 - 181.40] P:1614.92 E:0.105967 |  Cobbie Menu is slipped by Fordham.
[181.40 - 184.84] P:1811.52 E:0.115407 |  As the challenge came in, he was nudged over in the free kick.
[184.84 - 188.04] P:1964.50 E:0.108905 |  After the challenge by Shelton, goes England's way.
[189.24 - 191.52] P:1816.44 E:0.113022 |  They've done really well, those two midfielders,
[191.52 - 193.72] P:1610.84 E:0.113700 |  for the Dutch Shelton and Reinders.
[193.72 - 196.36] P:1623.45 E:0.116634 |  And that's going to be a huge responsibility on those two tonight,
[196.36 - 198.52] P:1604.15 E:0.098062 |  particularly with the positions that Fordham
[198.52 - 200.08] P:1660.00 E:0.116633 |  and Bellingham will want to get into.
[200.08 - 203.36] P:1630.27 E:0.093087 |  You can see them now, they've just actually either understood on them.
[203.36 - 205.96] P:1443.01 E:0.105879 |  Yeah, they've been consistent selections.
[205.96 - 207.64] P:1580.26 E:0.108039 |  In advance of the tournament, you would have thought
[207.64 - 209.48] P:1518.39 E:0.109486 |  Frankie De Jong and Coop Miners,
[209.48 - 211.20] P:1415.07 E:0.111991 |  maybe Martin De Ronde would have been in there,
[211.20 - 212.80] P:1514.16 E:0.114497 |  so they've done very well, these two.
[212.80 - 215.28] P:1694.25 E:0.099971 |  Here's Fordham as England moving through the middle,
[215.28 - 218.48] P:1716.03 E:0.102841 |  but then the recovering De Pryde just takes it away from him.
[218.48 - 221.88] P:1590.56 E:0.115948 |  And Van Dijk goes back to Per Proggen, who Fordham goes all over.
[221.88 - 223.68] P:1724.69 E:0.088273 |  He had to be very sharp there.
[223.68 - 227.16] P:1749.53 E:0.103852 |  The 21-year-old, Dutch goalkeeper, all in yellow.
[227.16 - 230.84] P:1775.06 E:0.113309 |  And England playing it out to the white headband of De Pryde.
[230.84 - 232.44] P:1660.99 E:0.111902 |  Now you can hear the orange.
[232.44 - 235.24] P:1717.77 E:0.112858 |  Simon's ball through to Marlon on the edge of the penalty area,
[235.24 - 238.68] P:1645.64 E:0.103582 |  but a very good challenge from Walker, coming across,
[238.68 - 241.72] P:1677.70 E:0.106884 |  timed it well, and the ball was just deflected back to Pickham.
[241.72 - 243.08] P:1640.73 E:0.106875 |  That was really good play from the Dutch,
[243.08 - 244.96] P:1695.73 E:0.110401 |  the way they moved it back from the goalkeeper,
[244.96 - 246.96] P:1649.93 E:0.110906 |  through to the midfield and then into De Pryde,
[246.96 - 250.12] P:1585.42 E:0.099254 |  and then trying to get the ball forward quickly into Marlon.
[250.12 - 251.44] P:1701.24 E:0.094959 |  Want to watch that one.
[251.44 - 252.64] P:1700.88 E:0.104362 |  Early thoughts, Matt Upsum?
[252.64 - 253.60] P:1813.90 E:0.110050 |  Yeah, it just shows you back.
[253.60 - 255.60] P:1593.82 E:0.104183 |  I mean, England really went hard on the press there,
[255.60 - 257.80] P:1589.16 E:0.113235 |  didn't they? Foden went all the way into the keypun.
[257.80 - 259.80] P:1630.23 E:0.111657 |  And Holland played through really well.
[259.80 - 262.00] P:1789.35 E:0.096615 |  He is spelling him now. Striding from deep,
[262.00 - 263.84] P:1652.17 E:0.103196 |  plays it to his right, the Harry Kane.
[263.84 - 266.24] P:1562.02 E:0.099044 |  Now Saka, right side of the penalty area.
[266.24 - 268.08] P:1491.00 E:0.099877 |  Saka, up against Nathan Ackie,
[268.08 - 270.00] P:1586.19 E:0.103954 |  kills it in left foot, it's towards the back post.
[270.00 - 273.12] P:1567.50 E:0.099389 |  Red defy, got his head to it, didn't clear the penalty area.
[273.12 - 275.64] P:1540.25 E:0.096100 |  Trippie is there, he's able to get the ball down.
[275.64 - 277.80] P:1635.27 E:0.098202 |  Rice, this is the first real pressure
[277.80 - 279.64] P:1588.34 E:0.091941 |  that we've seen from either side.
[279.64 - 281.32] P:1673.63 E:0.093903 |  And England testing the Dutch defence.
[281.32 - 285.04] P:1569.93 E:0.100808 |  Rice, now Phil Fordham, still waiting for his first.
[285.08 - 288.48] P:1579.13 E:0.101582 |  Toss it with involvement in terms of goal or assist
[288.48 - 290.84] P:1620.98 E:0.100466 |  at the tournament that his pass forward found Trippie
[290.84 - 293.36] P:1685.73 E:0.096435 |  in an offside position and it's a free kick for the Dutch.
[293.36 - 294.72] P:1756.12 E:0.113552 |  It shouldn't be offside there, Trippie.
[294.72 - 296.40] P:1683.80 E:0.106814 |  He's looking right across the line.
[296.40 - 299.56] P:1636.57 E:0.102610 |  In his defence, he did want the ball played to him
[299.56 - 301.92] P:1691.16 E:0.102986 |  that little bit earlier because he'd gone and wanted it,
[301.92 - 304.60] P:1639.11 E:0.104258 |  but because it didn't and there's a little bit of delay on it,
[304.60 - 306.60] P:1651.68 E:0.089397 |  he then ran into an offside position.
[307.88 - 311.64] P:1395.33 E:0.097014 |  So Netherlands, Nail, England, Nail.
[311.64 - 314.80] P:1600.69 E:0.110301 |  The Dutch intercession on the edge of their own penalty area,
[314.80 - 318.48] P:1554.71 E:0.101877 |  the Dutch, who themselves have not been in a World Cup
[318.48 - 322.56] P:1535.22 E:0.094797 |  or European Championship semi-final for 10 years,
[322.56 - 327.52] P:1542.63 E:0.091915 |  not for 20 years in this competition since Euro 2004.
[327.52 - 330.40] P:1392.67 E:0.102152 |  Here's Van Dijk, who missed the last Euros.
[330.40 - 334.08] P:1429.88 E:0.091352 |  Remember when England went so close at Wendley?
[335.24 - 337.80] P:1537.36 E:0.093990 |  De Vrij, very, very patient.
[337.80 - 341.44] P:1459.16 E:0.095361 |  And then Schaapten back to Van Dijk.
[341.44 - 343.72] P:1724.81 E:0.096915 |  And here is Nathan Ackie.
[343.76 - 347.48] P:1890.11 E:0.105863 |  Nathan Ackie with his club mate, Phil Forden, closest to him.
[347.48 - 350.68] P:1855.85 E:0.108107 |  Now it's worked here to Reinders, Gackpaw,
[350.68 - 354.12] P:1895.14 E:0.108204 |  one of the joint top scorers, dis-possessed by Saka.
[354.12 - 356.24] P:1772.28 E:0.100930 |  And Saka making ground quickly up to Harry Kane,
[356.24 - 357.48] P:1675.23 E:0.091299 |  gives it back to Saka.
[357.48 - 360.08] P:1652.08 E:0.099026 |  Kane might have been felled, but the referee waves the advantage.
[360.08 - 363.08] P:1716.68 E:0.091629 |  Although Saka is actually just weaving from right to left,
[363.08 - 365.60] P:1753.65 E:0.093989 |  but England retained possession.
[365.60 - 368.12] P:1861.38 E:0.092893 |  Rice goes back to Stones
[368.12 - 371.52] P:1735.14 E:0.092698 |  and then Walker a little ball in for him to Bellingham.
[371.56 - 374.08] P:1636.26 E:0.117911 |  Maynou's just back to A to the right-hand side.
[374.08 - 377.32] P:1573.18 E:0.099813 |  You see Ronald Kuhmann for the first time down there
[377.32 - 380.20] P:1360.51 E:0.093526 |  since the start of the match with his still-blonde hair,
[380.20 - 382.96] P:1428.81 E:0.098731 |  dressed in black, England's all-adversary.
[382.96 - 385.12] P:1586.18 E:0.116114 |  As Trippier sends one forward for Bellingham to chase,
[385.12 - 387.76] P:1699.54 E:0.101831 |  but that will just bounce through to Verbrogan.
[387.76 - 389.44] P:1569.74 E:0.106785 |  It's a really good tackle from Saka, wasn't it,
[389.44 - 391.72] P:1497.62 E:0.101895 |  when the Dutch were trying to get the ball into Gackpaw?
[391.72 - 392.92] P:1594.47 E:0.103249 |  It was one of those where...
[392.92 - 395.64] P:1766.81 E:0.098063 |  I'm just going to let you know I'm here in the first few minutes of the game.
[395.64 - 398.04] P:1527.58 E:0.091220 |  He timed it to perfection, Saka, that tackle.
[398.04 - 399.08] P:1337.08 E:0.076783 |  Yes, he did.
[399.08 - 400.12] P:1312.03 E:0.084645 |  0-0.
[400.12 - 402.04] P:1343.58 E:0.093639 |  And De Vrij.
[403.04 - 407.36] P:1400.67 E:0.105421 |  And Van Dijk again with the ball halfway inside their own half.
[407.36 - 409.20] P:1475.31 E:0.087835 |  Harry Kane comes to him.
[409.20 - 412.56] P:1419.37 E:0.107489 |  And so Van Dijk plays it to Dumfries over there on the right-hand side.
[412.56 - 416.00] P:1465.31 E:0.101275 |  The other inter-man, his pass for Mark Gay back in the team as well.
[416.00 - 417.36] P:1822.08 E:0.124668 |  The Rea just gets to it.
[417.36 - 419.16] P:1747.77 E:0.113727 |  Rice is robbed by Simon.
[419.16 - 421.36] P:1935.67 E:0.109815 |  Simon shoots and scores!
[422.64 - 425.40] P:1792.22 E:0.119706 |  What a super strike that was from Simon
[425.40 - 427.28] P:1617.14 E:0.107234 |  from the edge of the penalty area.
[427.32 - 429.96] P:1563.36 E:0.105237 |  It arrowed beyond the dive of Pikvijd.
[429.96 - 433.88] P:1579.64 E:0.108411 |  I said Pikvijd as well has just collided with one of the Dutch players.
[433.88 - 436.28] P:1494.77 E:0.113579 |  But it is 1-0 to the Netherlands
[436.28 - 438.24] P:1573.01 E:0.106986 |  and a goal in the seventh minute
[438.24 - 440.88] P:1593.38 E:0.102282 |  and the Dutch are ahead in the semifinal.
[440.88 - 442.80] P:1550.80 E:0.100382 |  Wow, what a strike.
[442.80 - 444.48] P:1662.87 E:0.111948 |  He couldn't have hit it any better.
[444.48 - 448.00] P:1736.24 E:0.109361 |  It just opened up for him and the shot was so inviting
[448.00 - 449.72] P:1692.03 E:0.104087 |  that he wasn't going to turn it down.
[449.72 - 451.84] P:1736.78 E:0.107510 |  What was it, 20-23 yards out?
[451.84 - 454.40] P:1685.87 E:0.101647 |  And it pinged into the right-hand side of the net.
[454.40 - 456.80] P:1643.00 E:0.088711 |  Pikvijd had no chance.
[456.84 - 458.92] P:1735.49 E:0.107994 |  Did really well in winning the tackle.
[458.92 - 461.48] P:1714.50 E:0.101432 |  Takes the ball off of Rice, I think it is, in there.
[461.48 - 462.76] P:1733.46 E:0.102815 |  Then it just opens up.
[462.76 - 464.56] P:1689.95 E:0.097373 |  There's no pressure on the ball.
[464.56 - 466.24] P:1777.81 E:0.102065 |  What a strike, what a goal.
[467.12 - 469.56] P:1751.36 E:0.110596 |  It's not often you see Declan Rice,
[469.56 - 471.84] P:1787.01 E:0.100513 |  dispossessed in that area of the pitch.
[471.84 - 473.88] P:1776.45 E:0.099407 |  Simon's really was aggressive.
[473.88 - 476.24] P:1855.62 E:0.097253 |  He wanted the ball and he took it.
[476.24 - 479.92] P:1701.21 E:0.106509 |  And then from then on, the positivity, he just saw the hole.
[479.92 - 481.60] P:1779.92 E:0.103838 |  It's a funny technique, the way he hits it.
[481.60 - 483.92] P:1802.81 E:0.106682 |  He's almost kind of sliding into the shot,
[483.96 - 487.76] P:1792.00 E:0.107364 |  strikes it really straight on, but hits it really flush.
[487.76 - 490.08] P:1727.46 E:0.112312 |  Sweet into the top corner, super shot.
[490.92 - 494.56] P:1742.37 E:0.100527 |  So there we are, a big early setback for England.
[494.56 - 499.44] P:1552.33 E:0.103452 |  And Fagaris Southgate as Savi Simons of PSG scores
[499.44 - 502.60] P:1691.55 E:0.094622 |  in front of the now-orange wall.
[502.60 - 505.24] P:1673.87 E:0.095356 |  He has Bellingham on the edge of the penalty area.
[505.24 - 508.16] P:1693.89 E:0.106716 |  So once again, England are going to have to come from behind.
[508.16 - 511.08] P:1626.07 E:0.097031 |  Bellingham's attempted cross, that's blocked.
[511.08 - 514.12] P:1585.10 E:0.103919 |  Came from behind in the round of 16,
[514.12 - 516.88] P:1572.47 E:0.090717 |  came from behind in the quarter-final.
[516.88 - 520.92] P:1565.73 E:0.094541 |  And here today, they are behind early in the seventh minute.
[520.92 - 524.08] P:1622.23 E:0.097075 |  Simons, what a goal it was.
[524.08 - 525.40] P:1597.06 E:0.102992 |  Brilliantly struck.
[526.36 - 530.60] P:1592.10 E:0.112806 |  Just his second-friest country and it flew past Pickford.
[530.60 - 534.20] P:1689.21 E:0.103205 |  There is a foul for Marlins' challenge
[534.20 - 537.20] P:1778.70 E:0.097620 |  on Bellingham who was caught about the face.
[537.20 - 540.84] P:1600.58 E:0.107806 |  And it's a free kick to England near the left corner of the penalty area.
[540.84 - 544.16] P:1611.58 E:0.111488 |  I think they just battled for the ball and you may have just took one
[544.16 - 546.84] P:1622.89 E:0.101836 |  on the face with Shouten, I think it was, wasn't it?
[546.84 - 548.84] P:1642.59 E:0.088708 |  The little clash of heads, isn't it?
[549.84 - 552.84] P:1621.86 E:0.102307 |  And Bellingham, actually, Kieran Trippier saying to them,
[552.84 - 554.84] P:1657.15 E:0.115375 |  the England medical people who ran onto the field,
[554.84 - 556.84] P:1611.91 E:0.105126 |  Kieran Trippier is actually standing over him and saying,
[556.84 - 558.84] P:1734.60 E:0.094653 |  go on, actually no, we don't need you.
[558.84 - 560.84] P:1565.53 E:0.089424 |  And they've just run off the field on the far side.
[560.84 - 563.84] P:1640.46 E:0.091527 |  Bellingham's OK, but actually now the Dutch medical people
[563.84 - 566.84] P:1705.96 E:0.086482 |  have been called on because Shouten, who did collide,
[566.84 - 569.84] P:1616.03 E:0.089923 |  he is going to be looked at.
[569.84 - 572.84] P:1555.40 E:0.093886 |  And it is a knock-up head, so understandable.
[572.84 - 578.84] P:1587.89 E:0.091293 |  But in England's set piece, what a goal that was to score in a semi-final.
[578.84 - 582.84] P:1623.43 E:0.101161 |  I see one striker was, he won many better than that in his career.
[582.84 - 585.84] P:1660.03 E:0.097841 |  It was really impressive the way he robbed the rice of the ball
[585.84 - 588.84] P:1556.44 E:0.096394 |  and then thought, you know what, I'm going to have a pop here.
[588.84 - 590.84] P:1674.74 E:0.078652 |  It just flew into the top corner.
[590.84 - 594.84] P:1667.22 E:0.087071 |  But England here have got a free kick in a really promising position.
[595.84 - 600.84] P:1453.39 E:0.093222 |  Last night, France went ahead early against the Spanish.
[600.84 - 603.84] P:1527.80 E:0.099846 |  And great goal that was here by Simon.
[603.84 - 608.84] P:1690.69 E:0.103838 |  So I don't think it was quite as good as Lameen Yamal's last night,
[608.84 - 611.84] P:1539.39 E:0.107672 |  which I think will have to be the goal of the tournament.
[611.84 - 612.84] P:1693.08 E:0.106795 |  Alan?
[612.84 - 614.84] P:1657.00 E:0.107042 |  Yeah, that was an incredible strike as well.
[614.84 - 617.84] P:1572.38 E:0.112390 |  From a 16-year-old, Johnny's 17, isn't he, on Saturday.
[617.84 - 619.84] P:1718.68 E:0.095180 |  So, yeah, what a goal.
[619.84 - 621.84] P:1764.49 E:0.104127 |  What a goal we've seen this evening.
[621.84 - 624.84] P:1671.33 E:0.091979 |  And actually, Bellingham has just gone off the field.
[624.84 - 627.84] P:1613.67 E:0.108720 |  They're just having a look at him, or has he just gone for...
[627.84 - 630.84] P:1542.33 E:0.097612 |  Actually, the referee's just gone over there to Jude Bellingham.
[630.84 - 634.84] P:1585.10 E:0.088667 |  The history they've got between them, just a little word between the two.
[634.84 - 636.84] P:1813.05 E:0.086757 |  I think he needs both of them to stay off the pitch
[636.84 - 639.84] P:1751.38 E:0.097337 |  because the trainers have both come on, so both players have to go off.
[639.84 - 641.84] P:1617.20 E:0.094355 |  They came on the field, so, yeah.
[641.84 - 644.84] P:1707.89 E:0.080395 |  So it's a free kick then, and both playing with 10 men
[644.84 - 646.84] P:1641.55 E:0.094491 |  and actually shouting, sitting down on the far side.
[646.84 - 649.84] P:1813.70 E:0.098858 |  Trippie, no, it's going to be Foden to take this free kick in,
[649.84 - 651.84] P:1744.59 E:0.099535 |  which is headed away by Ake, who did well,
[651.84 - 653.84] P:1595.89 E:0.092269 |  won that header commandingly.
[653.84 - 656.84] P:1672.09 E:0.093526 |  Seen him do that so often from Manchester City.
[656.84 - 660.84] P:1817.19 E:0.095532 |  Saka wins the ball back, the man who scored the equaliser.
[660.84 - 663.84] P:1823.33 E:0.109090 |  And the quarter-final, Saka is bungled into by Gatko,
[663.84 - 667.84] P:1888.13 E:0.110873 |  so sends him flying, and it's a free kick that the Dutch don't like,
[667.84 - 669.84] P:2049.42 E:0.107914 |  but shoulder into the back.
[669.84 - 671.84] P:2047.41 E:0.098138 |  He's had a good start to the game, Saka.
[671.84 - 673.84] P:2035.57 E:0.107078 |  You know, he's made a couple of really good tackles
[673.84 - 676.84] P:2007.66 E:0.099746 |  and trying to force his way down that right-hand side
[676.84 - 678.84] P:1760.57 E:0.091559 |  and trying to put the pressure back on them.
[679.84 - 681.84] P:1723.40 E:0.105715 |  He just switched on to us late.
[681.84 - 684.84] P:1702.56 E:0.091620 |  Alan Shearer is with us here on 5-Live tonight for the commentary,
[684.84 - 687.84] P:1483.00 E:0.099073 |  and the highlights will be on BBC One tonight after the news,
[687.84 - 689.84] P:1509.56 E:0.097001 |  and it's a free kick to England,
[689.84 - 692.84] P:1552.25 E:0.094050 |  England trailing to that early goal from Savvy, Simon's,
[692.84 - 695.84] P:1520.55 E:0.098907 |  and Trippie and Foden trying to work something again.
[695.84 - 699.84] P:1654.37 E:0.094673 |  England have created so little from set pieces
[699.84 - 702.84] P:1577.84 E:0.099194 |  without the Harry Maguire threat at this tournament.
[702.84 - 706.84] P:1533.01 E:0.101089 |  He's been a big miss in that regard.
[706.84 - 710.84] P:1410.93 E:0.085960 |  Free kick that Trippie at will come up and strike now,
[710.84 - 712.84] P:1654.03 E:0.108925 |  curling it in towards the back post.
[712.84 - 714.84] P:1678.20 E:0.106944 |  Rice is there, tries to work it across,
[714.84 - 716.84] P:1655.47 E:0.102703 |  and Kim was on the edge of the six-yard box,
[716.84 - 718.84] P:1827.49 E:0.097445 |  but Van Dijk got there to lash it out
[718.84 - 721.84] P:1575.02 E:0.097471 |  and play into the England fans over on the far side.
[721.84 - 723.84] P:1785.29 E:0.100605 |  You mentioned the lack of chances from set pieces.
[723.84 - 726.84] P:1685.42 E:0.098564 |  There's actually been a lack of chances in all of the games that they've played.
[727.84 - 729.84] P:1661.19 E:0.111883 |  It's been one of the big disappointments,
[729.84 - 732.84] P:1622.13 E:0.090782 |  with the forward talent that they've got.
[732.84 - 734.84] P:1805.73 E:0.102880 |  They just haven't created anywhere near enough.
[734.84 - 737.84] P:1429.90 E:0.085350 |  Yeah, it is perplexing, actually,
[737.84 - 740.84] P:1536.59 E:0.100677 |  as Rice gets the ball back
[740.84 - 742.84] P:1747.38 E:0.113811 |  with the referee spotting him in the fringe.
[742.84 - 744.84] P:1640.94 E:0.111348 |  They played it back to Trippie,
[744.84 - 746.84] P:1684.00 E:0.101841 |  who was then in an offside position, so it's a free kick to the Dutch.
[746.84 - 749.84] P:1744.47 E:0.095644 |  For the second time, Trippie, again, he's looking right across the line.
[750.84 - 753.84] P:1562.74 E:0.102346 |  And he is offside, he can't have any complaints.
[753.84 - 758.84] P:1289.21 E:0.102881 |  It is the Dutch who take the free kick,
[758.84 - 761.84] P:1410.10 E:0.106235 |  and Bellingham and Schouten are both back on the field.
[761.84 - 764.84] P:1495.40 E:0.107274 |  I think, yes, there is Schouten down there, the number 24.
[764.84 - 769.84] P:1575.33 E:0.101509 |  Great noise from the Dutch as England try to respond.
[769.84 - 773.84] P:1554.46 E:0.097664 |  Here is Manu, going between two Dutch players, gives it to Trippie.
[773.84 - 776.84] P:1518.46 E:0.097513 |  Bellingham's out there, Bellingham picks out Kane.
[776.84 - 779.84] P:1686.83 E:0.111079 |  On his right foot, Kane shoots and for Brogdon has to go down
[779.84 - 782.84] P:1760.94 E:0.103056 |  and save that, the shot from probably 25 yards plus,
[782.84 - 784.84] P:1721.45 E:0.103392 |  and it's out for a throw on the far side.
[784.84 - 786.84] P:1707.50 E:0.097466 |  Yeah, why not have a pop?
[786.84 - 789.84] P:1699.52 E:0.092823 |  Very much like it did for Siemens, it opened up for him.
[789.84 - 791.84] P:1705.49 E:0.090242 |  He didn't need a second invitation, it was a decent save.
[791.84 - 793.84] P:1690.23 E:0.098884 |  Keep it down to his right-hand side.
[793.84 - 797.84] P:1552.46 E:0.080364 |  So that's England do have an attempt on target,
[797.84 - 800.84] P:1799.76 E:0.105891 |  and for Brogdon had to make a decent save down to his right,
[800.84 - 802.84] P:1609.37 E:0.093015 |  had a good sight of it.
[802.84 - 805.84] P:1533.21 E:0.094093 |  England, as they play from left to right here as we look,
[805.84 - 809.84] P:1620.74 E:0.089169 |  behind already, Rice back to Gay.
[809.84 - 813.84] P:1593.85 E:0.095735 |  Now here's Trippie, over on the far side, comes back to Mark Gay,
[813.84 - 816.84] P:1520.41 E:0.097398 |  who will just steer it all the way back to Jordan Pickler.
[816.84 - 819.84] P:1636.31 E:0.093585 |  So let's bring in Matt Upsson, again, thoughts, Matt?
[819.84 - 821.84] P:1773.77 E:0.113378 |  He has an interest in Parry, wasn't it, from the Brogdon?
[821.84 - 824.84] P:1940.11 E:0.108435 |  He made it look easy, but he parried it all the way out for a throw.
[824.84 - 826.84] P:1935.05 E:0.091895 |  It's a really good piece of play from the goalkeeper,
[826.84 - 829.84] P:1936.65 E:0.092668 |  but Harry Kane just dropping into that pocket,
[829.84 - 832.84] P:1729.81 E:0.106753 |  England with good possession, he found some space and got a shot off.
[832.84 - 835.84] P:1731.74 E:0.102763 |  Bellingham passes intercepted, but into the path of Kane.
[835.84 - 838.84] P:1802.11 E:0.096415 |  Now the Saka, Saka, under his left foot, trying to find a position,
[838.84 - 842.84] P:1817.15 E:0.092917 |  still going, Saka shoots, it's blocked, then Kane!
[842.84 - 846.84] P:1718.33 E:0.102674 |  Over the top of the crossbar and Kane's been caught in there.
[846.84 - 851.84] P:1731.24 E:0.093907 |  As Kane hit that, he's clutching his right foot and he's in some pain
[851.84 - 853.84] P:1682.29 E:0.092327 |  as the shot flew over the top of the crossbar.
[853.84 - 855.84] P:1776.46 E:0.093973 |  Well, the England players are looking to the referee,
[855.84 - 857.84] P:1574.91 E:0.084691 |  they think there was a collision.
[857.84 - 859.84] P:1851.22 E:0.107771 |  Saka does really well, he runs into the traffic,
[859.84 - 862.84] P:1814.70 E:0.093418 |  but then the ball falls, kindly for Kane.
[862.84 - 866.84] P:1691.74 E:0.086278 |  I think it's just Dumfries that comes in with that challenge.
[866.84 - 870.84] P:1608.55 E:0.074192 |  He does connect with him, you know.
[870.84 - 874.84] P:1723.39 E:0.086080 |  As he came in, Dumfries, Kane had already hit the shot.
[874.84 - 879.84] P:1618.52 E:0.100841 |  And let's bring in Izzy, this is at your end Izzy,
[879.84 - 882.84] P:1674.36 E:0.093306 |  so you were 10-12 yards away from it.
[882.84 - 886.84] P:1800.29 E:0.096093 |  Yeah, if that, John, I mean, it's a wonderful strike from Harry Kane,
[886.84 - 888.84] P:1764.10 E:0.106078 |  he does so well to generate the power and I thought it was in.
[888.84 - 891.84] P:1792.13 E:0.092097 |  And it sailed over the bar, but there was some power behind it
[891.84 - 895.84] P:1763.89 E:0.084425 |  and he went down, Harry Kane, in a lot of pain.
[895.84 - 897.84] P:1847.51 E:0.105259 |  And he did catch him late, didn't he, Dumfries?
[897.84 - 899.84] P:1729.17 E:0.100236 |  I know that you guys can see the monitor up there,
[899.84 - 902.84] P:1913.45 E:0.086738 |  but Kane's shot earlier to that as well was fantastic,
[902.84 - 906.84] P:1903.26 E:0.097735 |  because he hit it into the ground and Vibrugan has had to really, really watch that,
[906.84 - 909.84] P:1930.26 E:0.087546 |  because that's how to score, is to hit into the ground
[909.84 - 911.84] P:1836.44 E:0.081558 |  and watch the ball fizz off the surface.
[911.84 - 914.84] P:1839.02 E:0.099502 |  The referee is saying to Vibrugan,
[914.84 - 917.84] P:1827.94 E:0.083885 |  do not take this goal kick because there is a check,
[917.84 - 920.84] P:1814.02 E:0.098666 |  there's a VAR check and I can understand why, Alan.
[920.84 - 922.84] P:2010.69 E:0.095219 |  Absolutely, he does get a good strike on it,
[922.84 - 925.84] P:1882.41 E:0.100408 |  but there's no doubt about it, Dumfries comes in for the challenge,
[925.84 - 927.84] P:1897.51 E:0.118661 |  doesn't get anywhere near the ball, but it's a...
[927.84 - 931.84] P:1872.57 E:0.103159 |  There's the square, the referee's being called over to have a look,
[931.84 - 934.84] P:1789.91 E:0.109876 |  and we know what this means, it's going to be a penalty to England.
[934.84 - 937.84] P:1800.32 E:0.106921 |  There was no contact at all with the ball from Dumfries,
[937.84 - 939.84] P:1731.61 E:0.091331 |  he actually collects with Harry,
[939.84 - 942.84] P:1715.59 E:0.105168 |  even more that he had to follow through,
[942.84 - 946.84] P:1873.29 E:0.100894 |  but there's no doubt that he boots up high and Harry does get the ball,
[946.84 - 949.84] P:1873.38 E:0.097944 |  but he also, with a full follow through, then connects with him.
[949.84 - 951.84] P:1727.10 E:0.091145 |  Pat, as the defender...
[951.84 - 955.84] P:1754.55 E:0.103510 |  I mean, is it hard to see whether he gets a touch of the ball, Dumfries?
[955.84 - 958.84] P:1796.02 E:0.097769 |  I don't think he gets a tone on the ball,
[958.84 - 961.84] P:1953.84 E:0.103124 |  therefore the follow through of Kane, he does raise his foot
[961.84 - 963.84] P:1822.56 E:0.104606 |  and he studs her up, Dumfries,
[963.84 - 965.84] P:1875.24 E:0.112809 |  which is why Harry Kane's in so much pain,
[965.84 - 969.84] P:1783.39 E:0.106148 |  he's actually struggling to shrug off the knock on the top of his foot.
[969.84 - 974.84] P:1886.86 E:0.104838 |  I mean, it's a fair challenge for the ball and he's a little bit late.
[974.84 - 976.84] P:1968.45 E:0.121905 |  It's a penalty.
[976.84 - 981.84] P:1798.24 E:0.106414 |  VAR, the German video assistant referee,
[981.84 - 984.84] P:1788.65 E:0.102981 |  in conjunction with Felix Weier,
[984.84 - 987.84] P:1738.88 E:0.092901 |  they decided it's a spot kick for England.
[987.84 - 990.84] P:1716.87 E:0.108724 |  And Kane, who took this knock on his right foot,
[990.84 - 993.84] P:1773.47 E:0.099753 |  and I think there was concern from Garas Southgate,
[993.84 - 996.84] P:1701.95 E:0.099022 |  he sent Pukaj Osaka over to see Harry Kane,
[996.84 - 999.84] P:1682.45 E:0.094995 |  to see if he was all right to take this penalty.
[999.84 - 1001.84] P:1577.64 E:0.102311 |  What do you think the answer is, Alan?
[1001.84 - 1004.84] P:1674.47 E:0.103389 |  No, Harry's got to take the penalty, I think he's up there,
[1004.84 - 1007.84] P:1620.40 E:0.106946 |  he might be in some pain, but believe you me,
[1007.84 - 1010.84] P:1704.06 E:0.095032 |  when you get a penalty, that pain wears off.
[1010.84 - 1012.84] P:1746.50 E:0.090995 |  Yeah.
[1012.84 - 1014.84] P:1677.09 E:0.104655 |  So, Harry Kane, now...
[1014.84 - 1017.84] P:1687.90 E:0.103876 |  I think he's just booked Dumfries as well for that, John,
[1017.84 - 1019.84] P:1772.12 E:0.106019 |  which is... I mean, it's pretty harsh.
[1019.84 - 1022.84] P:1753.89 E:0.102146 |  I mean, he's genuinely gone to block the shot,
[1022.84 - 1024.84] P:1812.56 E:0.102542 |  I don't think he's lashed out at Harry Kane,
[1024.84 - 1027.84] P:1735.01 E:0.103364 |  I think he's got a little bit carried away there, the referee.
[1027.84 - 1029.84] P:1773.39 E:0.104785 |  The yellow card for Dumfries,
[1029.84 - 1033.84] P:1787.84 E:0.103479 |  and Virgil van Dijk was in long discussions with referee Zweiher.
[1033.84 - 1036.84] P:1711.83 E:0.103909 |  Memphis de Pijen was going in for there as well.
[1036.84 - 1039.84] P:1776.59 E:0.099986 |  But here we are, another penalty
[1039.84 - 1041.84] P:1873.83 E:0.108002 |  at Euro 2024,
[1041.84 - 1045.84] P:1944.02 E:0.114708 |  and this time, Harry Kane from 12 yards.
[1045.84 - 1049.84] P:1968.04 E:0.120356 |  In front of the England fans, it should be said,
[1049.84 - 1052.84] P:1979.92 E:0.119679 |  this is the North End, where the England fans all are.
[1052.84 - 1057.84] P:1980.07 E:0.115435 |  Kane, the man who scored more penalties for England
[1057.84 - 1059.84] P:1983.01 E:0.113506 |  than anyone else.
[1059.84 - 1062.84] P:1941.16 E:0.119403 |  But remember the miss in the quarterfinal in Qatar.
[1062.84 - 1066.84] P:1955.77 E:0.116299 |  Kane stands one foot in front of the other, and waits and waits.
[1067.84 - 1072.84] P:1939.57 E:0.113348 |  Final, big, deep breath, and Kane is up to score!
[1072.84 - 1074.84] P:1833.20 E:0.116623 |  Into the bottom corner!
[1074.84 - 1078.84] P:1726.32 E:0.116247 |  The broken went the right way down to his right,
[1078.84 - 1082.84] P:1666.75 E:0.113077 |  but Harry Kane can celebrate here in Dortmund.
[1082.84 - 1085.84] P:1474.75 E:0.111297 |  He's got his third goal of the tournament,
[1085.84 - 1088.84] P:1702.98 E:0.110792 |  and he's now the joint-leading scorer.
[1088.84 - 1091.84] P:1690.95 E:0.106802 |  And it's Netherlands won, England won,
[1091.84 - 1093.84] P:1612.65 E:0.106386 |  and down to you, is he, Christensen?
[1093.84 - 1096.84] P:1663.24 E:0.120910 |  Unbelievable penalty from Harry Kane.
[1096.84 - 1098.84] P:1911.97 E:0.106682 |  He looks so confident.
[1098.84 - 1101.84] P:1886.15 E:0.114151 |  He controlled every single person in this stadium.
[1101.84 - 1103.84] P:1800.81 E:0.098566 |  He took a big, big, deep breath,
[1103.84 - 1106.84] P:1864.59 E:0.106253 |  and he just slots it into this bottom corner,
[1106.84 - 1108.84] P:1907.95 E:0.091273 |  right in front of my eyes.
[1108.84 - 1111.84] P:1892.72 E:0.114096 |  I was watching Keir and Trippie throughout that whole process.
[1111.84 - 1114.84] P:1876.22 E:0.105839 |  Him and Jude Bellingham were just guarding Harry Kane,
[1114.84 - 1116.84] P:1881.34 E:0.110006 |  keeping him safe for many distractions.
[1116.84 - 1119.84] P:1822.50 E:0.094255 |  He looks so focused, clean from the penalty spot for Harry Kane.
[1119.84 - 1122.84] P:1779.34 E:0.120062 |  Really, really calm.
[1122.84 - 1124.84] P:1739.78 E:0.092406 |  And he hits it to perfection.
[1124.84 - 1126.84] P:1781.08 E:0.111332 |  He has to, because the goalkeeper goes the right way,
[1126.84 - 1128.84] P:1763.79 E:0.096766 |  to his right-hand side.
[1128.84 - 1131.84] P:1674.28 E:0.096961 |  Having said that, he's not stopping it.
[1131.84 - 1134.84] P:1719.84 E:0.094771 |  Went right in the corner, right in the side netting.
[1134.84 - 1139.84] P:1751.40 E:0.109019 |  I mean, it doesn't matter how well the goalkeeper dives at that one,
[1139.84 - 1141.84] P:1774.03 E:0.109503 |  because he hits it that hard and that low,
[1141.84 - 1143.84] P:1787.86 E:0.092094 |  it sneaks just inside the post at the bottom.
[1143.84 - 1146.84] P:1829.52 E:0.101353 |  Nearly impossible for any keeper to save.
[1146.84 - 1148.84] P:1761.60 E:0.087531 |  Top penalty from Harry Kane.
[1148.84 - 1151.84] P:1794.06 E:0.095487 |  Netherlands won, England won,
[1151.84 - 1155.84] P:1796.46 E:0.085088 |  and England equalising from the penalty spot
[1155.84 - 1159.84] P:1766.80 E:0.089851 |  through Harry Kane's 22nd penalty for England,
[1159.84 - 1165.84] P:1572.19 E:0.096248 |  out of the now 66 goals that he has scored for his country.
[1165.84 - 1167.84] P:1556.29 E:0.101509 |  England's record score-ups.
[1167.84 - 1169.84] P:1547.30 E:0.105969 |  The ball goes back to Thurbroggen,
[1169.84 - 1172.84] P:1618.13 E:0.108414 |  who went the right way, Alan, he wasn't too far away from it.
[1172.84 - 1174.84] P:1764.91 E:0.108722 |  I would have guessed he would have gone that way as well,
[1174.84 - 1176.84] P:1581.39 E:0.100023 |  very much like the goalkeeper,
[1176.84 - 1178.84] P:1591.82 E:0.098746 |  when you hit it as sweetly as that.
[1178.84 - 1181.84] P:1740.71 E:0.110575 |  It's where he wanted to put it, it's where he practices on the keeper,
[1181.84 - 1183.84] P:1738.60 E:0.085434 |  can go away every once, he's not stopping it.
[1183.84 - 1185.84] P:1673.77 E:0.095942 |  So back on level terms.
[1187.84 - 1193.84] P:1811.05 E:0.093862 |  The Dutch lead lasted for 11 minutes.
[1193.84 - 1195.84] P:1590.48 E:0.094037 |  And with that goal now, Alan,
[1195.84 - 1197.84] P:1703.05 E:0.090177 |  that is 15 for Harry Kane
[1197.84 - 1200.84] P:1693.41 E:0.102359 |  at either World Cup or European Championship Tournament.
[1200.84 - 1205.84] P:1724.97 E:0.100012 |  And he's drawn level at Euros with a certain Eishira.
[1206.84 - 1207.84] P:1505.45 E:0.097649 |  Seven goals.
[1207.84 - 1209.84] P:1740.33 E:0.101761 |  Let's hope we beat it tonight then.
[1209.84 - 1211.84] P:1790.97 E:0.098172 |  Is that a good start to this game, you know?
[1211.84 - 1212.84] P:1744.69 E:0.092624 |  He has.
[1212.84 - 1214.84] P:1839.12 E:0.098349 |  He had the shot from 20 or 25 yards, which he'd keep the save.
[1214.84 - 1216.84] P:1778.10 E:0.089372 |  He then had the shot which got the penalty,
[1216.84 - 1218.84] P:1791.39 E:0.102704 |  and then it caused the penalty.
[1219.84 - 1222.84] P:1696.99 E:0.103739 |  So that's the voice of the now joint leading scorer
[1222.84 - 1225.84] P:1798.65 E:0.110232 |  at the Euros for England, Alan Shearer.
[1225.84 - 1228.84] P:1764.20 E:0.109206 |  As De Pymis controls the ball out of play.
[1228.84 - 1231.84] P:1635.86 E:0.096094 |  Important door for England to make a quick response.
[1231.84 - 1232.84] P:1758.69 E:0.097208 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[1232.84 - 1234.84] P:1695.88 E:0.106535 |  I thought their response was really good, actually,
[1234.84 - 1237.84] P:1559.63 E:0.106082 |  because they were the initial threat from the Dutch.
[1237.84 - 1239.84] P:1529.11 E:0.101801 |  And England just settled themselves down.
[1239.84 - 1242.84] P:1577.08 E:0.107283 |  I think the Dutch will feel hard done by with that penalty.
[1242.84 - 1245.84] P:1720.92 E:0.112135 |  Because I agree with Matt when the defender goes in there.
[1245.84 - 1247.84] P:1575.29 E:0.101521 |  There was no intent to keep him in.
[1247.84 - 1249.84] P:1630.60 E:0.105822 |  He didn't really make the contact.
[1249.84 - 1253.84] P:1456.40 E:0.110025 |  It was the follow-through which Harry Kane generated with his shot.
[1253.84 - 1256.84] P:1542.11 E:0.106036 |  He has Foulden bringing it forward, gives it to Bellingham.
[1256.84 - 1259.84] P:1327.09 E:0.094191 |  Bellingham just turns, passes it to Trippier,
[1259.84 - 1261.84] P:1492.44 E:0.110516 |  just took a moment to get it under control.
[1261.84 - 1263.84] P:1468.41 E:0.082204 |  Foulden wants it, gets it.
[1263.84 - 1266.84] P:1555.14 E:0.104904 |  Now back to Declan Rice, who was just caught out for that opening goal.
[1266.84 - 1268.84] P:1519.94 E:0.094271 |  I think he slipped, actually, didn't he,
[1268.84 - 1271.84] P:1416.18 E:0.102440 |  when Simon's got the ball and took it away from a gay
[1271.84 - 1273.84] P:1528.14 E:0.093511 |  back in the side tonight for Konza,
[1273.84 - 1275.84] P:1535.32 E:0.111241 |  who's a little unfortunate, Esri Konza,
[1275.84 - 1278.84] P:1335.29 E:0.095874 |  because he put in such an impressive performance
[1278.84 - 1280.84] P:1219.98 E:0.107767 |  against Switzerland in the quarter-final.
[1280.84 - 1284.84] P:1396.25 E:0.102325 |  But he has Menu now in the pink boots, turns, faces the play,
[1284.84 - 1287.84] P:1478.91 E:0.111128 |  gives it to John Stones, takes it towards the halfway line
[1287.84 - 1290.84] P:1439.67 E:0.105312 |  and then Stones goes back across to Mark Gay.
[1290.84 - 1292.84] P:1456.76 E:0.103714 |  Brilliant atmosphere inside the ground.
[1292.84 - 1294.84] P:1590.23 E:0.107991 |  I mean, all of the stands, all of the spectators,
[1294.84 - 1297.84] P:1525.94 E:0.116656 |  close to the action as Menu chips it over the top cut.
[1297.84 - 1299.84] P:1433.48 E:0.112140 |  Phil Foulden, it bounces away.
[1299.84 - 1301.84] P:1525.02 E:0.112114 |  Trippier's going to leave that to Harry Kane,
[1301.84 - 1303.84] P:1301.44 E:0.098859 |  who's out there on the left-hand side.
[1303.84 - 1305.84] P:1357.97 E:0.107405 |  Kane now with the right foot crossed, it's a high-high one,
[1305.84 - 1308.84] P:1588.73 E:0.102486 |  right across the field, the Walker, who pulls that down,
[1308.84 - 1310.84] P:1599.10 E:0.104030 |  tried to lay it back to Menu on the edge of the box.
[1310.84 - 1312.84] P:1530.54 E:0.102252 |  They'd only succeeded in giving it to Reinders,
[1312.84 - 1314.84] P:1491.43 E:0.115541 |  who will pass it away to De Pauw.
[1314.84 - 1317.84] P:1753.08 E:0.114589 |  I think might have been given a shove in the back by Kyle Walker,
[1317.84 - 1320.84] P:1688.17 E:0.098262 |  but in any case, it's ever played for a throw into the Dutch.
[1320.84 - 1322.84] P:1711.61 E:0.118209 |  He did give a little shove, didn't he?
[1322.84 - 1324.84] P:1598.44 E:0.100984 |  I thought I didn't know whether Reff was going to give a free kick
[1324.84 - 1328.84] P:1651.95 E:0.108400 |  or at the throwing for the Dutch, but he's given a throwing.
[1328.84 - 1330.84] P:1770.15 E:0.103719 |  It's a proper match, isn't it?
[1330.84 - 1332.84] P:1847.45 E:0.110677 |  It's a really good start.
[1332.84 - 1334.84] P:1595.65 E:0.096120 |  It was a bright start from both teams,
[1334.84 - 1337.84] P:1566.80 E:0.116664 |  but then that fantastic strike from Siemens,
[1337.84 - 1339.84] P:1622.93 E:0.114650 |  it's a close to West to England.
[1339.84 - 1341.84] P:1456.24 E:0.097447 |  What are you going to offer?
[1341.84 - 1343.84] P:1565.67 E:0.114435 |  The Dutch tried to work it away through the middle,
[1343.84 - 1346.84] P:1720.64 E:0.106948 |  but Trippier comes across the right foot and pulls forward towards.
[1346.84 - 1348.84] P:1540.89 E:0.106537 |  Dalingham is in the centre-circle.
[1348.84 - 1350.84] P:1687.16 E:0.117235 |  Dalingham, this is former home as well, remember?
[1350.84 - 1353.84] P:1421.44 E:0.085609 |  Jude Dalingham, Foden, back to Kane,
[1353.84 - 1356.84] P:1572.87 E:0.110730 |  and he'll give it back towards the half-way line.
[1356.84 - 1358.84] P:1643.81 E:0.116182 |  Walker finds Foden,
[1358.84 - 1360.84] P:1786.91 E:0.124083 |  folding a little pass in field towards Manu.
[1360.84 - 1363.84] P:1679.53 E:0.111144 |  Kane wants it, but Manu up to the edge of the area.
[1363.84 - 1366.84] P:1873.31 E:0.111586 |  Slip it into Foden, Foden could be through, very tight.
[1366.84 - 1369.84] P:1806.18 E:0.104659 |  Oh, and the shot is blocked on the line.
[1369.84 - 1371.84] P:1728.51 E:0.106272 |  Incredibly by Dumfries.
[1371.84 - 1373.84] P:1678.83 E:0.109042 |  Brilliant footwork from Foden.
[1373.84 - 1375.84] P:1794.62 E:0.102436 |  How he found space in amongst all of that
[1375.84 - 1378.84] P:1714.08 E:0.105725 |  and got the shot in from the tightest of angles,
[1378.84 - 1380.84] P:1724.88 E:0.105933 |  and yet Dumfries right on the line stopped it.
[1380.84 - 1382.84] P:1774.84 E:0.112983 |  Well, we're not sure how it hasn't gone in,
[1382.84 - 1384.84] P:1775.56 E:0.115725 |  but all of us are looking to the referee to see
[1384.84 - 1386.84] P:1725.37 E:0.107407 |  whether the ball had crossed the line.
[1386.84 - 1389.84] P:1832.83 E:0.104914 |  Manu did really, really well in getting the ball to Foden,
[1389.84 - 1391.84] P:1650.06 E:0.099095 |  but then Foden's quick feet.
[1391.84 - 1395.84] P:1775.36 E:0.101020 |  He then goes to the goalkeeper and saw the slots it passed him.
[1395.84 - 1397.84] P:1593.66 E:0.089189 |  Saka, now left-footed ball.
[1397.84 - 1399.84] P:1799.90 E:0.115488 |  Trippier's got so much space on the left,
[1399.84 - 1401.84] P:1732.57 E:0.111138 |  Trippier's ball all the way across,
[1401.84 - 1404.84] P:1608.54 E:0.101364 |  a stretch and away by Defraie.
[1404.84 - 1406.84] P:1662.00 E:0.089234 |  The Dutch really stretch there.
[1406.84 - 1408.84] P:1677.22 E:0.103644 |  Now, they're trying again in England.
[1408.84 - 1410.84] P:1606.58 E:0.110060 |  There's two balls on the field.
[1410.84 - 1412.84] P:1643.51 E:0.108497 |  So the referee's have to stop play.
[1412.84 - 1414.84] P:1648.47 E:0.096838 |  How on earth did that happen?
[1414.84 - 1416.84] P:1680.05 E:0.105380 |  England, great momentum there.
[1416.84 - 1417.84] P:1776.48 E:0.105712 |  Two balls on the field.
[1417.84 - 1420.84] P:1823.97 E:0.099135 |  Well, we've seen 23 minutes of great football.
[1420.84 - 1424.84] P:1647.68 E:0.095281 |  I really encourage the way England have come back into this game,
[1424.84 - 1426.84] P:1672.27 E:0.107008 |  the way they're moving the ball around,
[1426.84 - 1429.84] P:1659.40 E:0.098893 |  the way Bellingham and Foden and Manu are controlling now
[1429.84 - 1432.84] P:1676.47 E:0.096930 |  that midfield and creating chances.
[1432.84 - 1434.84] P:1449.61 E:0.087553 |  Back down pitch side, is he?
[1434.84 - 1436.84] P:1594.26 E:0.114029 |  There's a beautiful weave from Foden, wasn't it?
[1436.84 - 1439.84] P:1723.77 E:0.113944 |  How many times have we seen him do that for Manchester City?
[1439.84 - 1441.84] P:1787.49 E:0.105377 |  He just takes on so many players.
[1441.84 - 1443.84] P:1825.82 E:0.104795 |  The way he got the shot off in the end,
[1443.84 - 1445.84] P:1684.42 E:0.098009 |  and it was a brilliant clearance from Dumfries on the line.
[1445.84 - 1447.84] P:1806.78 E:0.113421 |  Everyone behind me obviously thought it had gone over,
[1447.84 - 1450.84] P:1695.88 E:0.101155 |  but from my angle, to be honest, it definitely didn't cross the line.
[1450.84 - 1453.84] P:1655.91 E:0.095451 |  But it was unbelievable, unbelievable from Foden.
[1453.84 - 1457.84] P:1645.91 E:0.095460 |  It was immediately the referee's fire said,
[1457.84 - 1459.84] P:1524.49 E:0.098481 |  no, it hasn't crossed the line.
[1459.84 - 1461.84] P:1466.56 E:0.100352 |  We've not had a chance to see it again,
[1461.84 - 1463.84] P:1393.37 E:0.096108 |  but actually I need to see it again,
[1463.84 - 1467.84] P:1673.80 E:0.101019 |  because Foden's feet were almost quicker than the human eye.
[1467.84 - 1470.84] P:1439.76 E:0.098895 |  Rice with the pass to Walker on the right-hand side,
[1470.84 - 1476.84] P:1607.54 E:0.085848 |  now Foden, Manu back to Phil Foden, who, well, after that, goodness me,
[1476.84 - 1479.84] P:1611.14 E:0.103208 |  he certainly looks like he's in the mood to,
[1479.84 - 1482.84] P:1718.19 E:0.095489 |  like the rest of this England side, confound the critics,
[1482.84 - 1484.84] P:1648.45 E:0.105654 |  walk his ball into the edge of the area.
[1484.84 - 1486.84] P:1822.40 E:0.103014 |  It's 1-1 if you've just switched on.
[1486.84 - 1489.84] P:1804.46 E:0.096575 |  Siemens scoring the early goal, further touch,
[1489.84 - 1492.84] P:1632.89 E:0.101899 |  and Harry Kane with a penalty to equalise at the stadium,
[1492.84 - 1496.84] P:1720.35 E:0.096049 |  where he's now scored six goals in five competitive appearances.
[1496.84 - 1501.84] P:1760.61 E:0.107964 |  Harry Kane here is Saka, he's able to get the ball and run from 30 yards,
[1501.84 - 1504.84] P:1568.66 E:0.103328 |  goal-wards, Kane tries to turn, I thought he might have been caught there.
[1504.84 - 1507.84] P:1436.41 E:0.099080 |  Siemens is in there, and Siemens is able to play it back to Foghagen,
[1507.84 - 1510.84] P:1466.34 E:0.110150 |  who will clear up towards the halfway line,
[1510.84 - 1512.84] P:1528.93 E:0.096610 |  where Rice is underneath that, the headed,
[1512.84 - 1515.84] P:1521.35 E:0.105247 |  and it will bounce for Harry Kane, who pulls it down.
[1515.84 - 1518.84] P:1600.75 E:0.114211 |  Kane sets off on a run, and he's eased over by Dumfries.
[1518.84 - 1519.84] P:1805.86 E:0.110857 |  Has no free kick.
[1519.84 - 1521.84] P:1760.68 E:0.103512 |  I think Kane will be questioning that.
[1521.84 - 1525.84] P:1838.96 E:0.101688 |  Oh, but Foden almost in, but to Rice,
[1525.84 - 1527.84] P:1747.25 E:0.115995 |  he nipped the ball away from Dumfries,
[1527.84 - 1530.84] P:1815.57 E:0.102251 |  and Foden is saying that he was impeded there.
[1530.84 - 1533.84] P:1852.11 E:0.096011 |  I think he was, I think he definitely clipped the back of his heels.
[1533.84 - 1536.84] P:1863.01 E:0.103191 |  Foden really, really well and managed to nick the ball,
[1536.84 - 1538.84] P:1836.30 E:0.096533 |  but then when he's starting to run towards goal,
[1538.84 - 1540.84] P:1922.72 E:0.083783 |  he did, he just clipped his heels.
[1540.84 - 1543.84] P:1692.62 E:0.095030 |  So it's an impressive last 10 or 15 minutes from England,
[1543.84 - 1545.84] P:1731.69 E:0.113520 |  you know, the way, the move in the ball.
[1545.84 - 1548.84] P:1744.56 E:0.093591 |  However, here's one for Marlon to chase through the middle,
[1548.84 - 1550.84] P:1511.65 E:0.096355 |  that's headed away by Gay, now Rinders.
[1550.84 - 1552.84] P:1674.59 E:0.100351 |  Siemens gets that down, might have been a handball.
[1552.84 - 1555.84] P:1656.38 E:0.097403 |  Siemens' ball is blocked on the edge of the box by Rice,
[1555.84 - 1560.84] P:1633.72 E:0.095754 |  comes out to Rinders, who's very, very neat, shiny black boots.
[1560.84 - 1562.84] P:1612.60 E:0.090259 |  Sharp side parting.
[1562.84 - 1565.84] P:1688.40 E:0.093093 |  Again, Rinders back out to the right-hand side.
[1565.84 - 1567.84] P:1763.05 E:0.107111 |  Here is the cross that is blocked by Dumfries,
[1567.84 - 1571.84] P:1760.58 E:0.102837 |  and bounces out of play off Trippier for a throw over on the far side.
[1571.84 - 1573.84] P:1521.88 E:0.097810 |  Netherlands won, England won.
[1573.84 - 1576.84] P:1562.59 E:0.101033 |  I would say, Alan, that's the best period of play that we've seen from England.
[1576.84 - 1579.84] P:1589.98 E:0.104517 |  Absolutely, I said about moving the ball quicker,
[1579.84 - 1581.84] P:1666.49 E:0.094442 |  that's what we've been watching from Spain,
[1581.84 - 1583.84] P:1676.58 E:0.109797 |  where the vast majority of this tournament,
[1583.84 - 1586.84] P:1530.39 E:0.093271 |  for the last 10 or 15 minutes, England have done that.
[1586.84 - 1591.84] P:1348.45 E:0.102086 |  And to sink confirmation on our little screen here in the commentary box,
[1591.84 - 1593.84] P:1316.54 E:0.116377 |  that it was, the ball was about one-half way over the line,
[1593.84 - 1595.84] P:1394.71 E:0.093234 |  when it was stopped by Dumfries.
[1596.84 - 1599.84] P:1531.66 E:0.104760 |  Close, but not close enough, and here is Rinders, the number 14.
[1599.84 - 1602.84] P:1565.40 E:0.101585 |  Here's Gatpole, hardly been in the match.
[1602.84 - 1605.84] P:1364.43 E:0.099059 |  Gatpole, Gatpole back to Ney Den Ake,
[1605.84 - 1610.84] P:1340.44 E:0.095528 |  and now Gatpole, once again with his three goals.
[1610.84 - 1612.84] P:1373.55 E:0.097589 |  As I say, Harry Kane now joins that group.
[1612.84 - 1615.84] P:1470.17 E:0.104049 |  It's now six players who are all tied on three goals,
[1615.84 - 1618.84] P:1500.32 E:0.096416 |  as the joint top scorers at the tournament,
[1618.84 - 1621.84] P:1443.63 E:0.097288 |  with Harry Kane much more lined, being one of them.
[1621.84 - 1625.84] P:1578.37 E:0.095353 |  Can't be too bad if you're the joint top scorer at the tournament.
[1625.84 - 1627.84] P:1942.83 E:0.116321 |  He always will score goals, John, you know that.
[1627.84 - 1629.84] P:1879.64 E:0.101036 |  We all know that, that's why he's in the team.
[1629.84 - 1632.84] P:1670.82 E:0.099715 |  We know that we want a little bit more from him,
[1632.84 - 1636.84] P:1629.75 E:0.099535 |  so maybe off the ball, but the one thing he will guarantee is goals.
[1636.84 - 1637.84] P:1443.82 E:0.092069 |  Yeah, quite so.
[1637.84 - 1640.84] P:1565.11 E:0.098538 |  Here is De Vrij, who just carries it forward,
[1640.84 - 1645.84] P:1612.37 E:0.104648 |  and then Dumfries goes back to De Vrij again, through the middle,
[1645.84 - 1647.84] P:1684.04 E:0.115861 |  and attempt to click from the tie.
[1647.84 - 1649.84] P:1656.49 E:0.109570 |  It's blocked away, then Bellingham's onto base,
[1649.84 - 1652.84] P:1637.89 E:0.108735 |  Bellingham lovely footwork from him as well.
[1652.84 - 1654.84] P:1757.65 E:0.110250 |  And he releases Saka down the right-hand side.
[1654.84 - 1657.84] P:1701.16 E:0.095970 |  Saka again, sticking to the right wing here.
[1657.84 - 1661.84] P:1632.91 E:0.094580 |  He's drawing Nathan Ake into him, then plays the pass to Manu,
[1661.84 - 1664.84] P:1500.97 E:0.093610 |  who was challenged by Gatpo, but it bounces to Walker.
[1664.84 - 1667.84] P:1625.97 E:0.111166 |  Manu again, now he has Foden again in that dangerous position,
[1667.84 - 1670.84] P:1643.08 E:0.098917 |  a flick to his left, Bellingham, but then came the challenge,
[1670.84 - 1672.84] P:1751.79 E:0.104179 |  which took it back to Gorky for Berkeren.
[1672.84 - 1674.84] P:1776.54 E:0.106237 |  Yeah, again, but England passing it well.
[1674.84 - 1678.84] P:1578.62 E:0.103051 |  It's a really interesting battle going down this right-hand side for England.
[1678.84 - 1681.84] P:1346.17 E:0.105464 |  The Dutch left-hand side with Gatpo and Saka,
[1681.84 - 1684.84] P:1503.65 E:0.106235 |  and Saka certainly winning that battle at the minute.
[1684.84 - 1688.84] P:1473.65 E:0.106526 |  He just switched on to us, five-lives World Service from the BBC.
[1688.84 - 1692.84] P:1358.06 E:0.100125 |  It is Netherlands won, England won in the semifinal,
[1692.84 - 1695.84] P:1447.37 E:0.106658 |  with almost half an hour play for Berkeren.
[1695.84 - 1699.84] P:1314.25 E:0.102101 |  Long downfield from him, Hart Gage is underneath that,
[1699.84 - 1702.84] P:1148.35 E:0.106142 |  up against Marlon to head it forward for England.
[1702.84 - 1704.84] P:1219.17 E:0.112730 |  Rice keeps it in, over on the left wing,
[1704.84 - 1706.84] P:1331.52 E:0.105944 |  tried to play it in, field towards Bellingham.
[1706.84 - 1709.84] P:1642.00 E:0.114001 |  Now it's forward towards De Pye, who's got some space here,
[1709.84 - 1712.84] P:1577.11 E:0.105784 |  Rice out of position, De Pye, then towards the edge of the box.
[1712.84 - 1715.84] P:1631.18 E:0.115730 |  To Marlon, who hits the shot, that the defenders came together,
[1715.84 - 1717.84] P:1638.59 E:0.105072 |  and Gage put in the block,
[1717.84 - 1721.84] P:1629.00 E:0.103812 |  which deflected it wide of the goal and behind for a Dutch corner.
[1721.84 - 1723.84] P:1624.60 E:0.085247 |  The first corner of the match, Matt.
[1723.84 - 1724.84] P:1637.60 E:0.091774 |  This lad can run.
[1724.84 - 1727.84] P:1649.73 E:0.106252 |  Marlon, he's got some serious pace on that right-hand side.
[1727.84 - 1729.84] P:1447.43 E:0.092812 |  Every time a central player has the ball,
[1729.84 - 1731.84] P:1534.76 E:0.107598 |  he makes his starting run from out to in.
[1731.84 - 1733.84] P:1399.43 E:0.110926 |  He gets the wrong side of the trip here,
[1733.84 - 1735.84] P:1689.75 E:0.094197 |  but Walker reads it so early, gets across.
[1735.84 - 1737.84] P:1716.41 E:0.091057 |  He actually anticipates, it goes to the ground,
[1737.84 - 1739.84] P:1715.47 E:0.099683 |  he just wipes everything out.
[1739.84 - 1741.84] P:1486.82 E:0.099529 |  It's top-defended from Karl Walker,
[1741.84 - 1743.84] P:1624.27 E:0.105862 |  but it's got to be alert to that run.
[1743.84 - 1745.84] P:1621.72 E:0.097885 |  It's a dangerous one for the Dutch.
[1745.84 - 1747.84] P:1684.21 E:0.102800 |  Well, we know that the Dutch can be a threat from set pieces,
[1747.84 - 1749.84] P:1632.55 E:0.097932 |  most certainly.
[1749.84 - 1752.84] P:1635.22 E:0.108208 |  De Pye took the ball out to the right-hand side,
[1752.84 - 1755.84] P:1769.71 E:0.105103 |  but it's actually going to be taken, this corner,
[1755.84 - 1757.84] P:1829.39 E:0.104084 |  this right-sided corner,
[1757.84 - 1760.84] P:1811.67 E:0.106948 |  by Zabby Siemens.
[1760.84 - 1762.84] P:1680.55 E:0.113742 |  Reises his left arm.
[1762.84 - 1765.84] P:1581.57 E:0.106393 |  That noise comes out of the orange wall behind him.
[1765.84 - 1768.84] P:1656.11 E:0.112962 |  An outswinger, which is headed onto the top of the crossbar
[1768.84 - 1770.84] P:1575.29 E:0.095889 |  by Dungfries, and over the top of the bar.
[1770.84 - 1773.84] P:1679.03 E:0.091041 |  Pickford dived up, whether he had that cover or not,
[1773.84 - 1776.84] P:1678.29 E:0.087076 |  I'm not sure, hit the top of the bar and over anyway.
[1776.84 - 1778.84] P:1583.27 E:0.081779 |  Well, the carrier grit,
[1778.84 - 1780.84] P:1545.22 E:0.095378 |  the strength in there, the Dutch with Van Dijk in there,
[1780.84 - 1783.84] P:1451.22 E:0.098961 |  and De Vrij, and we're shouting in there,
[1783.84 - 1785.84] P:1717.07 E:0.099190 |  and of course with Dungfries, who actually gets ahead of it,
[1785.84 - 1787.84] P:1782.87 E:0.109662 |  he climbs really, really well,
[1787.84 - 1789.84] P:1398.27 E:0.073629 |  and I don't think Pickford's getting that.
[1791.84 - 1793.84] P:1723.13 E:0.077231 |  So, 1-1.
[1794.84 - 1798.84] P:1564.39 E:0.101528 |  In England, take the goal kick, Pickford, out to Nenu.
[1798.84 - 1802.84] P:1606.61 E:0.100689 |  And Nenu, the Manchester United teenager,
[1802.84 - 1804.84] P:1460.55 E:0.108016 |  sets off, gives it to Thoden.
[1804.84 - 1807.84] P:1302.40 E:0.097505 |  Now it's all the way out on the left-hand side to Tripier,
[1807.84 - 1809.84] P:1262.96 E:0.092224 |  and then back to Reis.
[1809.84 - 1813.84] P:1558.68 E:0.099636 |  Gloomy skies above the stadium here in Dortmund,
[1813.84 - 1816.84] P:1670.93 E:0.108352 |  as Nenu flicks it to his right to Wauke,
[1816.84 - 1820.84] P:1457.62 E:0.099391 |  and now down the line, Sacher again in a very, very wide position.
[1820.84 - 1825.84] P:1369.36 E:0.093199 |  Nathan Ackett gets tight on it, so Walker is involved.
[1825.84 - 1828.84] P:1385.00 E:0.113887 |  So is Ménu as well, and England are forced by the Dutch
[1828.84 - 1830.84] P:1308.82 E:0.106649 |  back into their own half.
[1831.84 - 1834.84] P:1350.74 E:0.128757 |  And then actually from Marke, it goes all the way back towards.
[1834.84 - 1836.84] P:1558.54 E:0.092897 |  He'll keep that Pickford.
[1836.84 - 1839.84] P:1660.31 E:0.108375 |  I can't tell you how much we enjoy in Kobe Ménu's performance.
[1839.84 - 1843.84] P:1395.82 E:0.105998 |  I have to say, he looks so confident when he gets the ball.
[1843.84 - 1846.84] P:1370.57 E:0.101018 |  His first touch, his pass, and he's driving at players.
[1846.84 - 1848.84] P:1224.11 E:0.106301 |  It's been a top performance from him so far.
[1848.84 - 1850.84] P:1418.23 E:0.102793 |  Here's John Stones carrying the ball forward,
[1850.84 - 1853.84] P:1222.47 E:0.101582 |  lays it out to the left-hand side from the halfway line.
[1853.84 - 1856.84] P:1382.80 E:0.101638 |  Here in Tripier, who lost here with Newcastle United
[1856.84 - 1858.84] P:1282.30 E:0.103339 |  in the Champions League this season.
[1858.84 - 1861.84] P:1038.25 E:0.112124 |  That was a very impressive Brutia Dortmund performance that night.
[1861.84 - 1864.84] P:1454.14 E:0.102593 |  He has folded, then in field towards Ménu.
[1864.84 - 1867.84] P:1401.76 E:0.107747 |  Ménu then picks out Harry Kane, 25 yards out.
[1867.84 - 1870.84] P:1500.77 E:0.097312 |  Kane drives it into the box, cleared away by Van Dijk.
[1870.84 - 1874.84] P:1691.90 E:0.101530 |  Ménu slides in there to win it back for England against Gatpole.
[1874.84 - 1877.84] P:1678.43 E:0.100621 |  Now Sacher on the right-hand side goes for the byline,
[1877.84 - 1879.84] P:1513.09 E:0.102464 |  chips it across the back post, there's no-one there.
[1879.84 - 1881.84] P:1546.78 E:0.103907 |  Tripier's trying to get there against Marlon.
[1881.84 - 1883.84] P:1547.36 E:0.105080 |  The two of them shoulder-to-shoulder,
[1883.84 - 1887.84] P:1638.42 E:0.091227 |  Tripier did well actually to get there ahead of the Shaven-headed Dutchman.
[1887.84 - 1891.84] P:1648.63 E:0.094004 |  Now Rice again, Rice trying to pick out that pass to his club mate Sacher.
[1891.84 - 1894.84] P:1691.00 E:0.097528 |  It bounces up, Sacher's able to chest it down.
[1894.84 - 1897.84] P:1581.50 E:0.101121 |  They've got two men on him now, it goes towards Foden.
[1897.84 - 1900.84] P:1707.27 E:0.113373 |  They want Foden to shoot, and he hits the post!
[1900.84 - 1905.84] P:1489.59 E:0.101781 |  The top-left corner, just needed a little more bend on it.
[1905.84 - 1908.84] P:1568.26 E:0.111373 |  It was so similar to your Mal last night, wasn't it?
[1908.84 - 1911.84] P:1589.22 E:0.112631 |  Identical position, again it opens up.
[1911.84 - 1914.84] P:1630.68 E:0.105588 |  He doesn't need a second invitation, he looks,
[1914.84 - 1917.84] P:1735.87 E:0.101700 |  and he can see the spot and he spots it, and the connection is great.
[1917.84 - 1920.84] P:1770.89 E:0.105968 |  And he's just watching it all the way, and we're thinking,
[1920.84 - 1923.84] P:1565.14 E:0.091058 |  come on, come on, dip, dip, a little bit quicker.
[1923.84 - 1925.84] P:1366.32 E:0.093403 |  Just didn't hit the post and bar.
[1925.84 - 1928.84] P:1472.34 E:0.109769 |  Izzy, you must have had your eyes on that, it was heading right at you.
[1928.84 - 1931.84] P:1573.43 E:0.101861 |  Absolutely superb again for Foden.
[1931.84 - 1934.84] P:1735.72 E:0.113528 |  How much joy is he getting, by the way, off that right-hand side coming in?
[1934.84 - 1936.84] P:1543.66 E:0.106852 |  And it opened up perfectly for him, and there's Strat,
[1936.84 - 1938.84] P:1672.42 E:0.113268 |  I mean, I thought it was Neslin in that.
[1938.84 - 1941.84] P:1509.44 E:0.108417 |  It was a superb strike, you could feel the noise from behind
[1941.84 - 1944.84] P:1621.19 E:0.112604 |  with the England fans urging him to shoot as soon as it opened up.
[1944.84 - 1946.84] P:1301.96 E:0.093667 |  Wonderful effort from him.
[1946.84 - 1948.84] P:1420.38 E:0.101183 |  So Foden strikes the frame of the goal again.
[1948.84 - 1950.84] P:1440.76 E:0.091277 |  I think that's the second time at the tournament.
[1950.84 - 1954.84] P:1367.76 E:0.100272 |  Had the ball in the net, ruled out for offside.
[1954.84 - 1956.84] P:1381.87 E:0.099501 |  He's getting close, Alan.
[1956.84 - 1959.84] P:1648.83 E:0.096996 |  He's playing well, I think they're certainly causing the Dutch problems
[1959.84 - 1962.84] P:1561.78 E:0.100102 |  in there with Maynou and Foden and Bellingham,
[1962.84 - 1964.84] P:1521.10 E:0.098088 |  with their movement in there.
[1964.84 - 1966.84] P:1754.35 E:0.100958 |  Foden trying to get in the hole, and Van Dyke doesn't really know
[1966.84 - 1969.84] P:1632.07 E:0.099550 |  whether to go in tight on Maynou on that occasion there,
[1969.84 - 1972.84] P:1454.45 E:0.093355 |  or sit and try and mark Harry Kane.
[1972.84 - 1974.84] P:1465.14 E:0.076102 |  They're getting joy in there.
[1974.84 - 1976.84] P:1542.15 E:0.109950 |  One-one the score. Here is Foden through the middle.
[1976.84 - 1979.84] P:1680.84 E:0.115045 |  He's leaned into by Rinders, the referee says play on.
[1979.84 - 1981.84] P:1620.25 E:0.102948 |  Maynou's able to take it on, he's up against Van Dyke,
[1981.84 - 1984.84] P:1532.46 E:0.105721 |  and he chips it forward for Cain, but Cain was on his heels,
[1984.84 - 1987.84] P:1570.61 E:0.103034 |  and the ball runs through to Brogan.
[1987.84 - 1990.84] P:1581.19 E:0.109582 |  And with Foden, De Pij is actually sitting down in the middle of the field,
[1990.84 - 1992.84] P:1483.29 E:0.110603 |  so the referee will stop play for a moment or two with the score.
[1992.84 - 1995.84] P:1361.60 E:0.104974 |  Netherlands won, England won, but for Phil Foden,
[1995.84 - 1998.84] P:1320.27 E:0.104828 |  after the season that he's had with the 27 goals that he scored
[1998.84 - 2001.84] P:1349.30 E:0.097658 |  for Manchester City and the 11 assists,
[2001.84 - 2003.84] P:1390.05 E:0.108001 |  he's also had the attempt that was stopped on the line here.
[2003.84 - 2005.84] P:1435.23 E:0.103104 |  He's hit the frame of the goal twice,
[2005.84 - 2007.84] P:1378.83 E:0.093878 |  he's had the ball in the net at the Zoonerman,
[2007.84 - 2009.84] P:1380.80 E:0.099656 |  ruled out for offside, and he's had one stopped on the line.
[2009.84 - 2012.84] P:1488.48 E:0.101545 |  Yeah, he's looked really sharp tonight, much more like Phil Foden,
[2012.84 - 2015.84] P:1450.08 E:0.097574 |  he's getting the ball in really tight positions,
[2015.84 - 2018.84] P:1704.05 E:0.100091 |  and turning and running towards that Dutch defence,
[2018.84 - 2021.84] P:1414.42 E:0.097644 |  and he's really, really unlucky there with that effort.
[2021.84 - 2023.84] P:1585.49 E:0.095189 |  What a great strike it was.
[2023.84 - 2025.84] P:1590.12 E:0.104933 |  He's got the ability, I wasn't...
[2025.84 - 2027.84] P:1652.36 E:0.112547 |  The freedom to pick the ball up in that area where you want it.
[2027.84 - 2031.84] P:1604.78 E:0.095015 |  He's on the right-hand side, which suits him, gets it out of his feet,
[2031.84 - 2034.84] P:1504.40 E:0.095404 |  that left foot curler, and it's just a brilliant hit,
[2034.84 - 2036.84] P:1636.11 E:0.100128 |  but not quite there, and he's just picking up...
[2036.84 - 2039.84] P:1524.27 E:0.103566 |  You can tell he's enjoying being on the pitch more in this role
[2039.84 - 2041.84] P:1514.61 E:0.084143 |  than out wide on the left.
[2041.84 - 2044.84] P:1595.32 E:0.098282 |  Alan, what's your good feeling about what we've seen so far here tonight?
[2044.84 - 2046.84] P:1619.66 E:0.111633 |  I'm really encouraged.
[2046.84 - 2048.84] P:1676.51 E:0.094493 |  I think there's been an energy about their performance,
[2048.84 - 2050.84] P:1722.39 E:0.102035 |  particularly the way they responded after going 1-0 down.
[2050.84 - 2052.84] P:1660.61 E:0.093504 |  They've certainly had that in their game,
[2052.84 - 2055.84] P:1519.42 E:0.094104 |  their pass-ins being crisper, it's being quicker,
[2055.84 - 2058.84] P:1628.27 E:0.097327 |  and they've created chances, so yeah, I'm very encouraged.
[2059.84 - 2063.84] P:1413.32 E:0.093053 |  So 1-1 after Siemens opened the scoring in the seventh minute,
[2063.84 - 2067.84] P:1519.47 E:0.090956 |  and Harry Kane with the equaliser from the penalty spot.
[2067.84 - 2074.84] P:1552.65 E:0.100121 |  Harry Kane, who has now scored 15 goals in his last 19 England appearances.
[2074.84 - 2078.84] P:1660.89 E:0.102490 |  And the Dutch are going to make a change now.
[2078.84 - 2081.84] P:1608.41 E:0.103367 |  Well, it's going to be...
[2081.84 - 2085.84] P:1545.14 E:0.099712 |  Memphis Depaille is not going to be able to continue.
[2085.84 - 2091.84] P:1660.76 E:0.094603 |  So, Joy Vierman of PSV, the Dutch champions,
[2091.84 - 2094.84] P:1693.44 E:0.097784 |  is going to come on into that midfield, so he's taken off Depaille,
[2094.84 - 2098.84] P:1753.12 E:0.079723 |  looks like Marlon's going to go through the middle for the time being,
[2098.84 - 2103.84] P:1687.29 E:0.089198 |  and Ronald Koeman is putting Vierman in there with Reinders and Schouten.
[2103.84 - 2105.84] P:1670.75 E:0.084224 |  So, sort of three-man central midfield,
[2105.84 - 2107.84] P:1694.89 E:0.096623 |  which they have played during the course of the tournament,
[2107.84 - 2111.84] P:1748.03 E:0.090428 |  but that's clearly a reaction, despite the injury to Memphis Depaille.
[2111.84 - 2116.84] P:1532.60 E:0.090564 |  That's clearly a reaction to the way the game is going, the floor of the game.
[2116.84 - 2119.84] P:1413.90 E:0.084806 |  As England have it on the edge of their own penalty area,
[2119.84 - 2122.84] P:1563.39 E:0.086413 |  and Trippier plays it back to Pickford.
[2123.84 - 2125.84] P:1442.00 E:0.101386 |  So that's it for Memphis Depaille,
[2125.84 - 2129.84] P:1464.53 E:0.100055 |  disappointing for it, the end for him after what,
[2129.84 - 2132.84] P:1588.50 E:0.097661 |  33, 35 minutes on the clock.
[2132.84 - 2135.84] P:1500.98 E:0.099128 |  Here's Mark Gaye for England on the left-hand side.
[2135.84 - 2138.84] P:1432.28 E:0.089252 |  The England fans making themselves heard now.
[2138.84 - 2141.84] P:1393.31 E:0.094991 |  They sense they know that it is England who are on top,
[2141.84 - 2144.84] P:1600.94 E:0.092016 |  despite the fact they went behind in this match.
[2144.84 - 2147.84] P:1657.90 E:0.104238 |  Stones just carries the ball into Dutch territory,
[2147.84 - 2151.84] P:1533.42 E:0.095073 |  drags it back, is looking for the options,
[2151.84 - 2154.84] P:1474.65 E:0.104032 |  goes back to Rice, who quickly works it to Mark Gaye,
[2154.84 - 2156.84] P:1473.80 E:0.106344 |  and he is going to bring the ball forward and give it to Jude Bellingham,
[2156.84 - 2158.84] P:1515.16 E:0.091620 |  and Bellingham now gets his head down
[2158.84 - 2161.84] P:1364.29 E:0.102595 |  and begins to glide out towards the left-hand side,
[2161.84 - 2164.84] P:1397.42 E:0.097280 |  where Trippier will return it to the Real Madrid man,
[2164.84 - 2167.84] P:1366.40 E:0.094827 |  and now Gaye and Detland Rice,
[2167.84 - 2172.84] P:1553.12 E:0.111446 |  and here is Walker in the centre-circle, Kyle Walker,
[2172.84 - 2174.84] P:1589.01 E:0.108806 |  winning his 89th cap tonight,
[2174.84 - 2178.84] P:1470.83 E:0.098549 |  so that's as many as Michael Owen for Kyle Walker.
[2178.84 - 2181.84] P:1513.82 E:0.096262 |  Rice to the left-hand side.
[2181.84 - 2184.84] P:1586.85 E:0.108947 |  Mark Gaye is actually going to carry the ball deep into Dutch territory,
[2184.84 - 2186.84] P:1580.34 E:0.101547 |  and he gives it to Bellingham,
[2186.84 - 2188.84] P:1445.02 E:0.097746 |  and Bellingham now turns back onto his left foot,
[2188.84 - 2190.84] P:1722.62 E:0.100727 |  that uses his right to play it behind Trippier,
[2190.84 - 2192.84] P:1554.65 E:0.115058 |  and he's caught, they hit there,
[2192.84 - 2196.84] P:1694.68 E:0.096180 |  or at least he made it look like he'd been caught there, Bellingham,
[2196.84 - 2199.84] P:1389.69 E:0.092103 |  but the referee was having none of that, and it's out for a throw.
[2199.84 - 2202.84] P:1722.86 E:0.110813 |  I think what he's done as well is put Seamones on the right-hand side
[2202.84 - 2204.84] P:1550.34 E:0.098447 |  and put Veerman in the middle there,
[2204.84 - 2206.84] P:1646.06 E:0.105469 |  just to try and show that midfield up,
[2206.84 - 2209.84] P:1612.91 E:0.096592 |  because England were having so much success in there,
[2209.84 - 2212.84] P:1258.10 E:0.097244 |  as I said, with Ford and Bellingham, and with Meenu.
[2212.84 - 2216.84] P:1467.35 E:0.096919 |  Yeah, they started with this midfield three
[2216.84 - 2219.84] P:1672.65 E:0.106506 |  against Austria in the group when they lost the match,
[2219.84 - 2221.84] P:1758.65 E:0.107685 |  but it is Gakpo now, for the Dutch.
[2221.84 - 2224.84] P:1722.59 E:0.096266 |  Gakpo, but Meenu slides in to cut that pass out,
[2224.84 - 2227.84] P:1519.29 E:0.094446 |  and Seamones was an option there,
[2227.84 - 2231.84] P:1651.37 E:0.094234 |  and actually Declan Rice is going to run away with the ball for England.
[2231.84 - 2233.84] P:1617.94 E:0.090258 |  Just gives it to Bellingham to his left.
[2233.84 - 2235.84] P:1484.17 E:0.093590 |  Dinglenstern side their own half.
[2235.84 - 2238.84] P:1765.51 E:0.084999 |  Fordon, Crossfield pass from him, which bounces up.
[2238.84 - 2241.84] P:1677.34 E:0.101531 |  Sack is able to get it down on the ground.
[2241.84 - 2244.84] P:1736.52 E:0.099948 |  That mention of that defeat to Austria does remind you
[2244.84 - 2247.84] P:1710.73 E:0.092624 |  that the Dutch did finish third in their group,
[2247.84 - 2249.84] P:1551.09 E:0.100727 |  yet are in the semi-finals,
[2249.84 - 2253.84] P:1565.47 E:0.111020 |  and received a good deal of criticism for not doing better than that.
[2253.84 - 2255.84] P:1519.63 E:0.107086 |  But they did recover in the knockout stages
[2255.84 - 2257.84] P:1568.14 E:0.107055 |  with the convincing win against Romania,
[2257.84 - 2260.84] P:1498.60 E:0.099119 |  and the come-from-behind win against Turkey.
[2260.84 - 2264.84] P:1538.67 E:0.105238 |  And my Dutch friends are telling me that Kuhmen's team
[2264.84 - 2266.84] P:1550.02 E:0.097281 |  are very adept at coming from behind.
[2266.84 - 2268.84] P:1606.27 E:0.098912 |  Here is Meenu, picks out a pass.
[2268.84 - 2272.84] P:1521.75 E:0.096882 |  That's stuck to Fordon's right boot, like the proverbial clue.
[2272.84 - 2276.84] P:1195.80 E:0.099956 |  Fordon, though, has Reinders right there with him, so Meenu.
[2276.84 - 2279.84] P:1322.46 E:0.108013 |  Back to Fordon again, he's seen lots and lots of the ball
[2279.84 - 2283.84] P:1393.73 E:0.105626 |  in these openings, 37 minutes, and a little bit more.
[2283.84 - 2286.84] P:1471.15 E:0.101458 |  Rice again, a match level at all square.
[2286.84 - 2290.84] P:1282.26 E:0.104721 |  Rice will just knock it across into the path of John Stones,
[2290.84 - 2293.84] P:1424.80 E:0.104202 |  and then Stones back towards Declan Rice.
[2293.84 - 2296.84] P:1320.24 E:0.107654 |  And then out on the left-hand side, Phil Fordon again,
[2296.84 - 2299.84] P:1431.40 E:0.099468 |  who's stayed out there for the time being.
[2299.84 - 2301.84] P:1447.81 E:0.102409 |  Fordon leaves it to Trippia.
[2301.84 - 2303.84] P:1443.90 E:0.120224 |  Trippia, Kane comes short.
[2303.84 - 2306.84] P:1380.19 E:0.102617 |  So no one inside the penalty area for England,
[2306.84 - 2309.84] P:1511.21 E:0.095885 |  so actually they go all the way back to Gay,
[2309.84 - 2312.84] P:1786.54 E:0.114239 |  who's got the ball halfway inside his own half, in Pickford.
[2312.84 - 2315.84] P:1850.01 E:0.106312 |  They'll actually say to Gay, you know, just let it run.
[2315.84 - 2319.84] P:1581.32 E:0.103937 |  So it's out to Stones, who goes for the crossfield pass.
[2319.84 - 2321.84] P:1527.78 E:0.112562 |  Trippia again, is all on his own out there,
[2321.84 - 2323.84] P:1577.28 E:0.111497 |  Dumfries standing well open.
[2323.84 - 2326.84] P:1466.70 E:0.110655 |  Fordon says, give it to me, and then Fordon runs towards the edge
[2326.84 - 2329.84] P:1405.96 E:0.113828 |  of the penalty area. Meenu, Meenu, over the top two,
[2329.84 - 2332.84] P:1387.20 E:0.107935 |  Walker, Walker chests it down, but had to twist the do-so.
[2332.84 - 2335.84] P:1303.01 E:0.107000 |  Got it right side of the box, gap ball with him, back to Meenu.
[2335.84 - 2338.84] P:1461.48 E:0.117029 |  Meenu puts his foot on it, the flick infield towards Fordon,
[2338.84 - 2340.84] P:1532.28 E:0.120183 |  on his left foot, Fordon, they're all shot,
[2340.84 - 2342.84] P:1679.79 E:0.101573 |  and Krupperman goes down, and makes the save.
[2342.84 - 2345.84] P:1702.03 E:0.103104 |  Actually just stops it, and then holds onto it, counter-he's right.
[2345.84 - 2347.84] P:1615.81 E:0.116862 |  They're playing some really good footballing,
[2347.84 - 2349.84] P:1617.33 E:0.081341 |  the movement is fantastic.
[2349.84 - 2351.84] P:1606.90 E:0.104934 |  They can't handle it at the moment, the Dutch,
[2351.84 - 2353.84] P:1505.38 E:0.095366 |  and the pace of the passing.
[2353.84 - 2356.84] P:1633.85 E:0.108516 |  When someone gets into an area, they're actually firing the ball
[2356.84 - 2358.84] P:1519.93 E:0.091822 |  into them with great confidence.
[2358.84 - 2361.84] P:1639.68 E:0.107896 |  Phil Fordon is really, really enjoying himself out there.
[2362.84 - 2364.84] P:1383.29 E:0.106700 |  I think Meenu is as well, isn't he?
[2364.84 - 2366.84] P:1573.33 E:0.105861 |  Unbelievable stuff from Kobe Meenu, clever.
[2366.84 - 2369.84] P:1480.70 E:0.105398 |  He's winning tackles, he's turning over the ball,
[2369.84 - 2371.84] P:1710.73 E:0.100626 |  he's driving with it, lovely little flick there,
[2371.84 - 2374.84] P:1661.15 E:0.100837 |  just to slip, Fordon in to get his shot off.
[2374.84 - 2377.84] P:1448.12 E:0.101007 |  I mean, he's been outstanding the young Manchester United
[2377.84 - 2379.84] P:1425.69 E:0.092087 |  Central midfield player.
[2379.84 - 2382.84] P:1437.92 E:0.109410 |  Yes, when you see him playing like this, in a match like this,
[2382.84 - 2384.84] P:1246.19 E:0.110870 |  I mean, it's a little bit like La Mignamal last night,
[2384.84 - 2387.84] P:1341.20 E:0.107241 |  as a teenager, as a 16-year-old with Meenu at 19.
[2387.84 - 2389.84] P:1327.31 E:0.112267 |  You wonder why we had that debate for such a long time
[2389.84 - 2391.84] P:1289.59 E:0.112730 |  about who would play alongside Ryze,
[2391.84 - 2393.84] P:1462.02 E:0.099020 |  but a long pass forward for the Dutch,
[2393.84 - 2395.84] P:1464.46 E:0.093230 |  but it's headed down by John Stones,
[2395.84 - 2398.84] P:1352.77 E:0.110798 |  and England could start again, Ryze makes himself available.
[2398.84 - 2401.84] P:1286.67 E:0.105629 |  Fordon wants it in the centre-circle, he's calling for it.
[2401.84 - 2403.84] P:1266.44 E:0.100338 |  Still, Ryze says, yeah, I'll give it to you,
[2403.84 - 2406.84] P:1215.57 E:0.103518 |  but then back to Gae in central defence.
[2406.84 - 2409.84] P:1594.08 E:0.101508 |  Yeah, at the tournament, England obviously tried Trent Alexander-Arnold
[2409.84 - 2411.84] P:1479.23 E:0.102486 |  in there, then it was Gallagher next,
[2411.84 - 2415.84] P:1574.00 E:0.102053 |  and then it was Meenu, but he's certainly catching the eye tonight,
[2415.84 - 2416.84] P:1609.26 E:0.093119 |  the Manchester United man.
[2416.84 - 2418.84] P:1585.77 E:0.100616 |  He is Gae, back towards Harry Kane,
[2418.84 - 2421.84] P:1601.38 E:0.092318 |  who's all the way in the centre-circle now,
[2421.84 - 2423.84] P:1686.49 E:0.108297 |  back towards John Stones.
[2423.84 - 2425.84] P:1540.33 E:0.098849 |  Kane says, yeah, I'll take it,
[2425.84 - 2428.84] P:1457.89 E:0.105360 |  and then Kane hits a pass right for it.
[2428.84 - 2430.84] P:1522.40 E:0.106479 |  That's the trippier to chase, the trippier with the flick.
[2430.84 - 2433.84] P:1441.42 E:0.099706 |  Back to Bellingham, Bellingham is onto this ball.
[2433.84 - 2434.84] P:1385.68 E:0.105968 |  Trippier makes himself available,
[2434.84 - 2436.84] P:1413.51 E:0.100738 |  wider to the left-hand side.
[2436.84 - 2437.84] P:1476.97 E:0.107144 |  Now it's back to Kane again.
[2437.84 - 2440.84] P:1474.22 E:0.101253 |  Kane curls it into the box, that's headed away by Van Dijk.
[2440.84 - 2442.84] P:1610.27 E:0.103504 |  Meenu tries to get there, he does get there.
[2442.84 - 2444.84] P:1657.85 E:0.104415 |  He just possesses Gakpo,
[2444.84 - 2447.84] P:1598.38 E:0.099806 |  and then Meenu blasts the shot straight into the chest of Nathan Acky,
[2447.84 - 2449.84] P:1587.83 E:0.103612 |  and it bounces out of play for a throw down the right.
[2449.84 - 2451.84] P:1706.86 E:0.115402 |  No, he's so bright and so alert, Meenu.
[2451.84 - 2453.84] P:1641.71 E:0.094425 |  I'll tell you what, you mentioned before,
[2453.84 - 2457.84] P:1613.31 E:0.102281 |  we didn't mention the great tackle he put in on the edge of his own box.
[2457.84 - 2462.84] P:1629.88 E:0.093185 |  He's now at the other side, having a pop-it goal from 18 yards out as well.
[2462.84 - 2463.84] P:1367.62 E:0.117734 |  So it's a throw for England,
[2463.84 - 2466.84] P:1508.77 E:0.085866 |  and Walker is going to take...
[2466.84 - 2469.84] P:1488.43 E:0.103499 |  Walker takes the throw down into the ground,
[2469.84 - 2471.84] P:1516.76 E:0.104145 |  bounces up, and as it was played forward,
[2471.84 - 2472.84] P:1484.91 E:0.115554 |  Meenu is in an offside position,
[2472.84 - 2473.84] P:1707.83 E:0.103179 |  but actually the referee says,
[2473.84 - 2475.84] P:1567.13 E:0.100157 |  I'm going to play the advantage here,
[2475.84 - 2477.84] P:1536.77 E:0.093493 |  because the Dutch are coming forward,
[2477.84 - 2485.84] P:1711.72 E:0.109479 |  although Seamans actually played it back towards the edge of his own penalty area.
[2485.84 - 2487.84] P:1882.53 E:0.120111 |  We've got quite a mix in front of us,
[2487.84 - 2490.84] P:1868.67 E:0.100292 |  the orange wall is to the left behind the goal,
[2490.84 - 2494.84] P:1748.21 E:0.105519 |  but there's a real mix of Dutch and English fans down in front of us.
[2494.84 - 2496.84] P:1600.92 E:0.121223 |  As Seamans plays it to the right,
[2496.84 - 2497.84] P:1767.47 E:0.097755 |  he's got too much on that,
[2497.84 - 2499.84] P:1747.53 E:0.092338 |  and it just rolls out of play for an England throw.
[2499.84 - 2503.84] P:1616.62 E:0.089444 |  I can see a woman down there just adjusting her.
[2503.84 - 2506.84] P:1620.27 E:0.091385 |  Probably an airline pilot's hat.
[2506.84 - 2509.84] P:1521.23 E:0.100652 |  Bright orange glitter on the front of it,
[2509.84 - 2510.84] P:1567.69 E:0.099291 |  and on the peak of the cap,
[2510.84 - 2514.84] P:1516.12 E:0.094787 |  she's got it set at a jaunty angle, I noticed.
[2514.84 - 2516.84] P:1445.68 E:0.103082 |  You're going to say something else from that, Joe?
[2516.84 - 2520.84] P:1630.87 E:0.102486 |  Well, she was actually about half an hour before we kicked off,
[2520.84 - 2522.84] P:1577.18 E:0.102116 |  carrying six pints down, not a three-one.
[2522.84 - 2525.84] P:1515.03 E:0.102110 |  No wonder it's at a jaunty angle, then, Alan.
[2525.84 - 2528.84] P:1350.90 E:0.100346 |  Here is Kane, got the ball inside his own heart,
[2528.84 - 2531.84] P:1416.52 E:0.103892 |  just clips it across into the path of Walker.
[2531.84 - 2535.84] P:1522.68 E:0.090262 |  Kara Southgate just appears in that cream shirt down there,
[2535.84 - 2538.84] P:1355.76 E:0.097162 |  and applauds the incentive of the England players.
[2538.84 - 2539.84] P:1686.39 E:0.111896 |  For all of the good play,
[2539.84 - 2542.84] P:1360.24 E:0.096868 |  and all of the near things that England have had in this first half,
[2542.84 - 2544.84] P:1359.95 E:0.112746 |  there is just the penalty to show from it,
[2544.84 - 2547.84] P:1375.43 E:0.103489 |  and in an absolutely ideal world,
[2547.84 - 2549.84] P:1361.36 E:0.102952 |  when they're playing like this in the first half,
[2549.84 - 2551.84] P:1455.08 E:0.105844 |  I'm sure Southgate and all England followers
[2551.84 - 2554.84] P:1352.41 E:0.100516 |  would like to see them ahead before the break.
[2554.84 - 2556.84] P:1354.48 E:0.094017 |  Walker, back towards Rice,
[2556.84 - 2558.84] P:1310.17 E:0.107718 |  Rice just sticks out his chest,
[2558.84 - 2560.84] P:1377.74 E:0.108955 |  uses Jude Bellingham,
[2560.84 - 2563.84] P:1448.24 E:0.102185 |  who will tap it back to John Stones.
[2563.84 - 2566.84] P:1476.69 E:0.109751 |  Maynou, in a very advanced position now,
[2566.84 - 2568.84] P:1450.10 E:0.112306 |  actually wanted the ball from Stones,
[2568.84 - 2572.84] P:1513.62 E:0.090872 |  but here's Thornton, who takes it up on the right-hand side,
[2572.84 - 2575.84] P:1415.91 E:0.107842 |  and then moves in field, gives it back to Stones.
[2575.84 - 2577.84] P:1342.93 E:0.105436 |  Then over the halfway line to Rice.
[2577.84 - 2579.84] P:1263.03 E:0.099882 |  Rice Bellingham says that he wants it.
[2579.84 - 2582.84] P:1307.60 E:0.096598 |  Actually, it goes to Gay, then back to Rice again.
[2582.84 - 2585.84] P:1509.46 E:0.101020 |  There's a much better temple about the England players.
[2585.84 - 2587.84] P:1425.04 E:0.095925 |  We so often say for England,
[2587.84 - 2590.84] P:1338.97 E:0.095600 |  these players, you do feel that moving the ball quickly
[2590.84 - 2591.84] P:1499.06 E:0.100129 |  is so important.
[2591.84 - 2593.84] P:1471.08 E:0.097254 |  Rice back out to Gay on the left-hand side.
[2593.84 - 2596.84] P:1415.68 E:0.092907 |  Trippie, Bellingham makes the run down into the pullback position.
[2596.84 - 2598.84] P:1575.78 E:0.104304 |  He's leaned into by De Vrij, keeps his feet.
[2598.84 - 2600.84] P:1644.33 E:0.103019 |  Bellingham then wins the pullback.
[2600.84 - 2602.84] P:1634.12 E:0.106068 |  Bellingham now whips it into the box,
[2602.84 - 2604.84] P:1614.77 E:0.086443 |  but Van Dijk is able to step forward
[2604.84 - 2606.84] P:1514.62 E:0.101999 |  and clear it away to the halfway line.
[2606.84 - 2607.84] P:1690.26 E:0.093862 |  Good again.
[2607.84 - 2609.84] P:1495.43 E:0.093114 |  Good running in behind from Bellingham.
[2609.84 - 2612.84] P:1619.39 E:0.101635 |  I think they're really controlling the midfield in there,
[2612.84 - 2616.84] P:1579.72 E:0.093324 |  and their movement is causing them all sorts of problems.
[2616.84 - 2619.84] P:1514.23 E:0.104610 |  Kyle Walker now it is, just forward and right of the centre-circle.
[2619.84 - 2623.84] P:1562.07 E:0.104279 |  Suddenly, we get a cooler breeze just blowing around the stadium.
[2623.84 - 2627.84] P:1476.06 E:0.100879 |  And a pinky sunset as well on those dark clouds
[2627.84 - 2632.84] P:1448.29 E:0.103178 |  above the yellow metalwork of this famous arena.
[2632.84 - 2633.84] P:1368.34 E:0.094724 |  Here is Declan Rice.
[2633.84 - 2635.84] P:1519.09 E:0.115077 |  Now, Rice through the middle of the folding.
[2635.84 - 2636.84] P:1434.38 E:0.099245 |  Folding with a scamper.
[2636.84 - 2640.84] P:1537.01 E:0.089562 |  Now, Bellingham turns near the corner of the penalty area.
[2640.84 - 2642.84] P:1498.32 E:0.104652 |  Gives it out to the left-hand side.
[2642.84 - 2644.84] P:1527.20 E:0.105871 |  Trippie is there. Trippie has ball across.
[2644.84 - 2647.84] P:1651.07 E:0.098415 |  Bellingham is just intercepted, but England back in possession.
[2647.84 - 2650.84] P:1625.22 E:0.091729 |  Again, it's Declan Rice, 30 yards from goal.
[2650.84 - 2652.84] P:1682.24 E:0.090384 |  England trying to crank up the pressure.
[2652.84 - 2654.84] P:1617.05 E:0.097995 |  The Dutch lying behind the ball.
[2654.84 - 2656.84] P:1458.81 E:0.100890 |  Bellingham again out there on the left-hand side.
[2656.84 - 2659.84] P:1512.21 E:0.097540 |  Up against Reinders, takes him on, drops the shoulder,
[2659.84 - 2662.84] P:1370.70 E:0.099056 |  goes back towards the byline, then pulls it back to Trippie.
[2662.84 - 2664.84] P:1436.40 E:0.101733 |  Then Rice makes himself available.
[2664.84 - 2666.84] P:1568.02 E:0.103479 |  It's coming square to Walker.
[2666.84 - 2668.84] P:1481.47 E:0.103867 |  It's coming square again to Kane.
[2668.84 - 2670.84] P:1513.33 E:0.097732 |  There's only Kane out there, so he has to chase after it.
[2670.84 - 2672.84] P:1504.89 E:0.098718 |  The England captain Kane under this,
[2672.84 - 2675.84] P:1537.07 E:0.101361 |  to Picayo Saka just outside the right corner of the penalty area.
[2675.84 - 2677.84] P:1611.72 E:0.095637 |  Walker makes the run.
[2677.84 - 2679.84] P:1706.02 E:0.102511 |  Saka, though, keeps possession.
[2679.84 - 2680.84] P:1726.03 E:0.102572 |  Takes it on past Beerman.
[2680.84 - 2682.84] P:1635.78 E:0.102637 |  Beerman still going with him.
[2682.84 - 2684.84] P:1684.28 E:0.109219 |  Saka then over to Bellingham.
[2684.84 - 2685.84] P:1688.13 E:0.099689 |  Now, Trippie on the overlap.
[2685.84 - 2688.84] P:1698.31 E:0.106741 |  Trippie across, but into the clubs of the broken,
[2688.84 - 2689.84] P:1758.50 E:0.101162 |  who makes the catch?
[2689.84 - 2692.84] P:1658.39 E:0.116837 |  That's just what you lose with not having the left footer
[2692.84 - 2694.84] P:1671.02 E:0.104452 |  on the left side in Keir and Trippie,
[2694.84 - 2696.84] P:1612.73 E:0.095865 |  because about 30 seconds before that,
[2696.84 - 2699.84] P:1628.90 E:0.102201 |  there was a ball that was crying out to be put in
[2699.84 - 2701.84] P:1587.39 E:0.101042 |  with the left foot, but he didn't.
[2701.84 - 2703.84] P:1556.65 E:0.104979 |  He didn't come back inside, but then the ball
[2703.84 - 2705.84] P:1825.48 E:0.084577 |  eventually goes back out to him,
[2705.84 - 2707.84] P:1696.19 E:0.090420 |  rather than actually whipping it across,
[2707.84 - 2709.84] P:1791.18 E:0.085961 |  he tries to chip it straight into the keeper's arms.
[2709.84 - 2712.84] P:1721.13 E:0.093324 |  Now the Dutch come forward, a rare attack for them,
[2712.84 - 2714.84] P:1768.42 E:0.097570 |  and it's being brought forward over,
[2714.84 - 2716.84] P:1804.89 E:0.089278 |  just in front of us by Beerman.
[2716.84 - 2719.84] P:1612.20 E:0.095093 |  Three minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
[2719.84 - 2722.84] P:1401.95 E:0.090587 |  And then, Shouten back to Reinders.
[2722.84 - 2728.84] P:1598.00 E:0.086180 |  And the pace just slows with the Dutch in possession.
[2728.84 - 2730.84] P:1610.48 E:0.099946 |  One-one is the score.
[2730.84 - 2733.84] P:1616.83 E:0.086578 |  Here's Nathan Ackie on the left-hand side.
[2733.84 - 2734.84] P:1565.95 E:0.104186 |  The threat is there.
[2734.84 - 2736.84] P:1575.56 E:0.085127 |  Certainly from the set piece,
[2736.84 - 2740.84] P:1672.50 E:0.100005 |  remember the Dumfries header that came off the top of the crossbar.
[2740.84 - 2744.84] P:1503.72 E:0.102797 |  But the Dutch just knocking it around in the central third,
[2744.84 - 2747.84] P:1661.30 E:0.103873 |  probably just enjoying a feel of the ball and some possession.
[2747.84 - 2750.84] P:1628.26 E:0.092923 |  Actually, we haven't seen this for some time in the match.
[2750.84 - 2755.84] P:1571.93 E:0.107936 |  So Beerman will use the captain, Virgil Van Dijk.
[2755.84 - 2759.84] P:1500.43 E:0.102948 |  And then Van Dijk just put the ball back towards
[2759.84 - 2761.84] P:1532.37 E:0.102825 |  the goalkeeper for Brogan.
[2761.84 - 2764.84] P:1702.10 E:0.102303 |  Half-time approaching, we'll have more on the events at Lourdes
[2764.84 - 2765.84] P:1794.67 E:0.092025 |  in the first test.
[2765.84 - 2768.84] P:1631.02 E:0.097539 |  Test match special will be back on air in the morning
[2768.84 - 2773.84] P:1602.77 E:0.096596 |  on Five Lives Sports Extra, with England having a dominant day.
[2773.84 - 2776.84] P:1748.85 E:0.106441 |  And on the subject of England, the rugby union team,
[2776.84 - 2778.84] P:1588.47 E:0.102629 |  you'll be able to hear the commentary live from Eden Park
[2778.84 - 2782.84] P:1496.74 E:0.098356 |  on the second test live from New Zealand on Saturday morning.
[2782.84 - 2785.84] P:1517.02 E:0.100786 |  And a rugby union daily podcast all this week
[2785.84 - 2787.84] P:1554.28 E:0.109745 |  with Chris Jones in New Zealand.
[2787.84 - 2789.84] P:1606.76 E:0.099676 |  And then Simon Seymons for the Dutch,
[2789.84 - 2792.84] P:1362.05 E:0.099902 |  giving it out to Ake on the left-hand side.
[2792.84 - 2795.84] P:1271.12 E:0.116161 |  Nathan Ake, head-loving behind him, Seymons,
[2795.84 - 2797.84] P:1429.15 E:0.122807 |  who set the ball rolling really.
[2797.84 - 2800.84] P:1570.62 E:0.101359 |  I think the goal that he scored almost helped to set the tone
[2800.84 - 2801.84] P:1617.31 E:0.079056 |  for the first half.
[2801.84 - 2803.84] P:1441.76 E:0.086768 |  Such a good finish that it was.
[2803.84 - 2806.84] P:1377.79 E:0.081766 |  Reinders back to De Vrij.
[2806.84 - 2809.84] P:1600.65 E:0.098760 |  And now Marlon out to the right.
[2809.84 - 2810.84] P:1682.07 E:0.097986 |  It goes to Dumfries.
[2810.84 - 2812.84] P:1595.55 E:0.099096 |  Dumfries with Tripp here in front of him.
[2812.84 - 2814.84] P:1567.90 E:0.104274 |  Probably the longest spell of possession that we've seen
[2814.84 - 2816.84] P:1603.01 E:0.095110 |  from the Dutch in the match so far.
[2816.84 - 2821.84] P:1702.05 E:0.101270 |  With still 90 seconds of the first 45 minutes to play.
[2821.84 - 2822.84] P:1413.02 E:0.115080 |  45 minutes plus.
[2822.84 - 2823.84] P:1556.92 E:0.112722 |  Here's Dumfries.
[2823.84 - 2826.84] P:1545.09 E:0.107074 |  Dumfries up against Tripp here, who steps in, puts in the challenge.
[2826.84 - 2833.84] P:1477.83 E:0.103262 |  And then once again, it is the Dutch who go back to Githrae
[2833.84 - 2835.84] P:1558.63 E:0.094166 |  and Van Dijk,
[2835.84 - 2839.84] P:1397.24 E:0.101058 |  tied up tightly at the back of his head, the Liverpool captain.
[2839.84 - 2842.84] P:1396.65 E:0.097146 |  And then Reinders back to De Vrij again.
[2842.84 - 2845.84] P:1473.27 E:0.103108 |  Into the last minute of added time at the end of the first half.
[2845.84 - 2848.84] P:1733.91 E:0.104512 |  Not sure the Dutch are actually going to go anywhere with this.
[2848.84 - 2852.84] P:1712.12 E:0.097873 |  Let's see as they play it forward to Simon, who's here on the left flank.
[2852.84 - 2854.84] P:1648.06 E:0.090472 |  Nathan Ackie is there as well.
[2854.84 - 2859.84] P:1440.72 E:0.095548 |  Simon has a little flick for the outside of his heel to Ackie.
[2859.84 - 2860.84] P:1353.77 E:0.096904 |  Ackie wants it back.
[2860.84 - 2861.84] P:1396.26 E:0.105674 |  Simon curls it to him.
[2861.84 - 2862.84] P:1435.00 E:0.098531 |  Ackie in with the challenge.
[2862.84 - 2863.84] P:1582.28 E:0.109335 |  Walker as well.
[2863.84 - 2865.84] P:1559.38 E:0.102952 |  And then Walker does well.
[2865.84 - 2866.84] P:1557.06 E:0.107388 |  Bull still in play though.
[2866.84 - 2867.84] P:1434.77 E:0.093457 |  Walker had to be very careful there.
[2867.84 - 2870.84] P:1441.91 E:0.100295 |  Gakpo plays it back towards the ball into the penalty area.
[2870.84 - 2872.84] P:1465.90 E:0.105026 |  Glans on from Ackie,
[2872.84 - 2874.84] P:1457.12 E:0.101257 |  but that will drop beyond the far post and wide.
[2874.84 - 2875.84] P:1604.94 E:0.097582 |  And it's a gold kick.
[2875.84 - 2877.84] P:1624.84 E:0.118407 |  And it remains 1-1 Alan Shearer.
[2877.84 - 2879.84] P:1763.46 E:0.097736 |  It was a good spell of possession for the Dutch one.
[2879.84 - 2882.84] P:1522.37 E:0.096397 |  They just moved it from right to left and then back to left to right.
[2882.84 - 2884.84] P:1697.42 E:0.115623 |  And then they eventually saw the opener
[2884.84 - 2886.84] P:1536.96 E:0.096693 |  and did really well to keep the ball in.
[2886.84 - 2889.84] P:1638.02 E:0.107451 |  And the balls then whipped into Ackie,
[2889.84 - 2891.84] P:1606.85 E:0.097910 |  who just got too much on it, didn't he?
[2891.84 - 2893.84] P:1279.39 E:0.097521 |  Then it was no problem.
[2893.84 - 2895.84] P:1593.58 E:0.099304 |  Just let it go out for the gold kick.
[2895.84 - 2897.84] P:1429.75 E:0.093710 |  I'd imagine that would be half-time then.
[2897.84 - 2899.84] P:1532.74 E:0.101960 |  Matt, a nice little tussle there, right from off there.
[2899.84 - 2901.84] P:1551.42 E:0.103534 |  That plush Manchester City training ground.
[2901.84 - 2902.84] P:1375.85 E:0.102354 |  Walker and Ackie.
[2902.84 - 2904.84] P:1439.42 E:0.092454 |  I'm surprised he kept it.
[2904.84 - 2907.84] P:1563.07 E:0.099778 |  He did really well to get his leg round and keep the ball in play.
[2907.84 - 2909.84] P:1674.65 E:0.104353 |  And there we have it, half-time in the semi-final.
[2909.84 - 2910.84] P:1642.35 E:0.106110 |  Netherlands won.
[2910.84 - 2912.84] P:1660.29 E:0.102497 |  England won as a great orange wave
[2912.84 - 2915.84] P:1736.02 E:0.104234 |  with people rise to their feet in front of us.
[2915.84 - 2920.84] P:1666.36 E:0.095532 |  And he's holding up his blazer as well with the Dutch lying on it.
[2920.84 - 2922.84] P:1702.43 E:0.079380 |  And somebody's giving you a bit of stick, Alan.
[2922.84 - 2924.84] P:1608.55 E:0.098741 |  Short thoughts on the first half?
[2924.84 - 2927.84] P:1668.65 E:0.088440 |  Very encouraged, very promising from England.
[2927.84 - 2929.84] P:1554.62 E:0.098793 |  I think their energy has been much better.
[2929.84 - 2931.84] P:1475.33 E:0.108555 |  Their presence has been really good.
[2931.84 - 2934.84] P:1641.43 E:0.094677 |  And they've created some really good chances,
[2934.84 - 2936.84] P:1832.45 E:0.092834 |  which we haven't seen in the previous game.
[2936.84 - 2938.84] P:1663.12 E:0.077189 |  So, yeah, I'm happy.
[2939.84 - 2941.84] P:1400.09 E:0.105957 |  Yes, extremely happy for me.
[2941.84 - 2943.84] P:1211.15 E:0.103524 |  I thought it was a top performance.
[2943.84 - 2946.84] P:1512.47 E:0.100234 |  Players that have shown up, we're talking about players like Foden.
[2946.84 - 2948.84] P:1531.61 E:0.096101 |  We're talking about Harry Kane.
[2948.84 - 2951.84] P:1510.14 E:0.084101 |  No, we're not talking about Mark Geh, he's been exceptional.
[2951.84 - 2953.84] P:1665.85 E:0.096804 |  He's been a real focus of the early games.
[2953.84 - 2955.84] P:1639.80 E:0.086799 |  But really, you want to be talking about the players
[2955.84 - 2957.84] P:1777.20 E:0.082139 |  at the end of the pitch performing.
[2957.84 - 2959.84] P:1644.63 E:0.098085 |  And I think there's two or three names there that have just been excellent.
[2959.84 - 2962.84] P:1487.09 E:0.080170 |  The first one is Zach has been excellent, drove it right from the off.
[2962.84 - 2964.84] P:1571.83 E:0.091268 |  And Kobe Maynou for me.
[2964.84 - 2966.84] P:1528.15 E:0.081164 |  Wow, what a first 45 minutes he's had.
[2966.84 - 2968.84] P:1534.69 E:0.085606 |  So, a half-time here in Dortmund.
[2968.84 - 2970.84] P:1498.65 E:0.092459 |  Zabby Siemens gave Netherlands the lead.
[2970.84 - 2973.84] P:1766.77 E:0.076934 |  Harry Kane equalised with the penalty.
[2973.84 - 2976.84] P:1676.88 E:0.081891 |  And it is Netherlands won, England won at the brick.
[2977.84 - 2979.84] P:1670.59 E:0.101991 |  I mean, the first thing to say is,
[2979.84 - 2982.84] P:1801.14 E:0.098969 |  I'm not sure who you fly with if you think that's an airline pilot's hat.
[2984.84 - 2986.84] P:1979.84 E:0.103812 |  Village people airways?
[2987.84 - 2990.84] P:1829.36 E:0.106026 |  Let's get down to Izzy Christy.
[2990.84 - 2992.84] P:1729.93 E:0.096061 |  You've been thinking about that, haven't you?
[2992.84 - 2994.84] P:1830.03 E:0.108885 |  Is he Christy?
[2994.84 - 2998.84] P:1747.27 E:0.092377 |  That thing was best 45 minutes at this tournament.
[2998.84 - 3002.84] P:1890.25 E:0.080799 |  Oh, some fantastic football being played there by England.
[3002.84 - 3004.84] P:1602.40 E:0.098269 |  I mean, they were zipping the ball around,
[3004.84 - 3006.84] P:1882.52 E:0.089215 |  they were piercing through the Dutch defence in the middle of it
[3006.84 - 3008.84] P:1801.36 E:0.083132 |  when it was the right time.
[3008.84 - 3011.84] P:1951.12 E:0.081353 |  Foden's come to life, he's been an absolute joy to watch.
[3011.84 - 3013.84] P:1938.32 E:0.088291 |  It's like he's wearing a Man City shirt again.
[3013.84 - 3015.84] P:1934.55 E:0.094995 |  And you've also got to give credit to the Dutch,
[3015.84 - 3017.84] P:1843.47 E:0.079318 |  because I think John just said it there in commentary.
[3017.84 - 3019.84] P:1845.46 E:0.094954 |  They set the tempo for the game,
[3019.84 - 3021.84] P:1946.45 E:0.090112 |  and they brought that side out of England
[3021.84 - 3025.84] P:1855.84 E:0.089855 |  because they conceded so early on to that fantastic goal by Zabby Siemens.
[3025.84 - 3029.84] P:1874.06 E:0.092815 |  But I think England, the fact that we've not mentioned Kodi Gappo
[3029.84 - 3032.84] P:1866.39 E:0.088739 |  is a massive plus, and I think Alan's also just mentioned it there.
[3032.84 - 3034.84] P:1886.86 E:0.085813 |  I was thinking the same, he must have read my mind.
[3034.84 - 3036.84] P:1858.50 E:0.086833 |  This game is crying out for Luke Schaarge.
[3036.84 - 3039.84] P:1906.31 E:0.085218 |  Trip has been fine, he's been absolutely fine,
[3039.84 - 3042.84] P:1845.81 E:0.084995 |  but the amount of crossing opportunities that we're missing
[3042.84 - 3045.84] P:1858.76 E:0.095960 |  and Bellingham going out there, get himself in the box,
[3045.84 - 3048.84] P:1829.73 E:0.077445 |  get Harry Kane inside the box and get the ball whipped in.
[3048.84 - 3052.84] P:1846.52 E:0.092770 |  England's right side, Matt, as you've mentioned, have bossed this.
[3052.84 - 3056.84] P:1827.21 E:0.085863 |  And we've seen, I think in previous games,
[3056.84 - 3060.84] P:1859.92 E:0.085670 |  we've seen evidence of a partnership between Foden and Manu
[3060.84 - 3063.84] P:1776.65 E:0.097400 |  when they are in a similar area of the field.
[3063.84 - 3067.84] P:1838.84 E:0.074094 |  You can see it tenfold tonight.
[3067.84 - 3069.84] P:1780.02 E:0.094061 |  He's fed in the ball a lot, I have to say,
[3069.84 - 3071.84] P:1721.83 E:0.096788 |  that they seem to be on a little wavelength,
[3071.84 - 3073.84] P:1773.04 E:0.095879 |  whether or not it's this side of the pitch,
[3073.84 - 3075.84] P:1838.97 E:0.089923 |  Bellingham tends to peel out to the left a little bit,
[3075.84 - 3078.84] P:1860.94 E:0.094162 |  but Foden, who's sitting more central and to the right,
[3078.84 - 3080.84] P:1912.15 E:0.094396 |  every time Manu drives forward with the ball,
[3080.84 - 3082.84] P:1894.45 E:0.091466 |  it seems to make a little run in,
[3082.84 - 3084.84] P:1901.84 E:0.081044 |  when he slipped him in for his quick feet,
[3084.84 - 3086.84] P:1961.20 E:0.098176 |  and really the ball, I thought it was in,
[3086.84 - 3088.84] P:1944.98 E:0.086938 |  and bang on the middle of the centre of the line.
[3088.84 - 3090.84] P:2013.32 E:0.085004 |  Such a great chance to create it,
[3090.84 - 3093.84] P:1930.98 E:0.091811 |  but between them, they've linked up probably three or four times
[3093.84 - 3095.84] P:2055.52 E:0.088394 |  in this first half to really good effect.
[3095.84 - 3098.84] P:1962.70 E:0.098714 |  He has an amazing awareness, Manu, doesn't he,
[3098.84 - 3101.84] P:1886.25 E:0.080573 |  of when to give it and when to run with it.
[3101.84 - 3103.84] P:1728.83 E:0.110908 |  And there was an example earlier in the first half,
[3103.84 - 3105.84] P:1750.68 E:0.093930 |  it may have been even before the England goal,
[3105.84 - 3108.84] P:1901.90 E:0.090334 |  where he turned inside his own box,
[3108.84 - 3110.84] P:1887.12 E:0.086800 |  and let the ball come across in Manu,
[3110.84 - 3113.84] P:1896.55 E:0.087304 |  and moved 20 yards with it, and took the Dutch press out of it.
[3113.84 - 3115.84] P:1944.45 E:0.090929 |  Yeah, he's aware of everything around him, you know,
[3115.84 - 3118.84] P:1860.64 E:0.083006 |  and what's also impressive is not when he passes,
[3118.84 - 3121.84] P:1877.62 E:0.096577 |  but how he passes it with the pace on it,
[3121.84 - 3123.84] P:1958.86 E:0.096407 |  so it enables to get there,
[3123.84 - 3126.84] P:1943.28 E:0.087097 |  because I said it last night on TV about the Spanish,
[3126.84 - 3129.84] P:1875.41 E:0.096843 |  what they do very well is they move it quickly,
[3129.84 - 3131.84] P:1883.47 E:0.098706 |  but they move it with pace,
[3131.84 - 3134.84] P:1820.14 E:0.092954 |  and when someone pings the ball into you as a player with pace,
[3134.84 - 3136.84] P:1948.69 E:0.087292 |  it's far easier to control.
[3136.84 - 3138.84] P:1896.78 E:0.083214 |  He's been brilliant at that in the first half.
[3138.84 - 3141.84] P:1822.03 E:0.095514 |  He's got a real casual style as well, hasn't he?
[3141.84 - 3143.84] P:1800.26 E:0.092415 |  He's got this relaxed body language,
[3143.84 - 3145.84] P:1875.38 E:0.076370 |  that looks nothing his face.
[3145.84 - 3148.84] P:1832.17 E:0.094386 |  I mean, you wouldn't know that he had any tension,
[3148.84 - 3150.84] P:1844.12 E:0.103183 |  or felt nervous at all.
[3150.84 - 3152.84] P:1788.76 E:0.083213 |  He's got this lovely, relaxed,
[3152.84 - 3154.84] P:1760.60 E:0.090639 |  super powerful when he's on the ball.
[3154.84 - 3158.84] P:1915.39 E:0.082065 |  If the Dutch had got a penalty from that challenge,
[3158.84 - 3160.84] P:1941.94 E:0.089892 |  do you think you would be...
[3160.84 - 3162.84] P:1889.41 E:0.088997 |  ...agreed about it?
[3162.84 - 3165.84] P:1912.97 E:0.090932 |  And also, from that defender's point of view,
[3165.84 - 3168.84] P:1982.68 E:0.067777 |  where he kind of just went...
[3168.84 - 3171.84] P:1843.30 E:0.095208 |  I mean, he sort of went to block it, not challenge it.
[3171.84 - 3174.84] P:1918.54 E:0.086647 |  Kane kicked him, and I know he's got his foot up, right,
[3174.84 - 3176.84] P:1915.59 E:0.091587 |  so you leave yourself vulnerable,
[3176.84 - 3180.84] P:1970.73 E:0.088822 |  but Harry Kane's follow-through has followed his...
[3180.84 - 3182.84] P:1977.36 E:0.093357 |  has volleyed his boot.
[3182.84 - 3185.84] P:1879.40 E:0.092610 |  I'm sure they look at that in the Premier League in overturn.
[3185.84 - 3188.84] P:1870.78 E:0.090519 |  I think if you give it either way, you'd be happy,
[3188.84 - 3190.84] P:1886.93 E:0.091307 |  but I don't think VAR needs to look at that
[3190.84 - 3192.84] P:1868.51 E:0.095113 |  and get into fear with the on-field decision.
[3192.84 - 3194.84] P:1833.17 E:0.095760 |  It was one of them for me.
[3194.84 - 3196.84] P:1942.41 E:0.091828 |  The referee could call it either way, you'd accept it,
[3196.84 - 3199.84] P:1821.21 E:0.088475 |  but he called it as no penalty, stay out of it.
[3199.84 - 3202.84] P:1867.49 E:0.098752 |  I think it's hard to then pull it to pieces on a slow-mo,
[3202.84 - 3206.84] P:1771.76 E:0.095630 |  and then give a foul and a yellow card with ridiculous.
[3206.84 - 3208.84] P:1858.43 E:0.100228 |  Look, there's no doubt that there's contact,
[3208.84 - 3211.84] P:1733.51 E:0.094283 |  but the contact isn't made from the defender.
[3211.84 - 3213.84] P:1770.33 E:0.101760 |  He's actually trying to block the ball
[3213.84 - 3215.84] P:1907.70 E:0.087887 |  and putting his foot up, which he has to do.
[3215.84 - 3218.84] P:1807.50 E:0.095246 |  The then-the-follow-through from Harry,
[3218.84 - 3220.84] P:2013.15 E:0.086389 |  because of the strike, makes the connection.
[3220.84 - 3223.84] P:1871.75 E:0.091491 |  I didn't think that was an absolute howler for it to be turned over.
[3223.84 - 3228.84] P:1786.21 E:0.100237 |  No. Alan, do you think Harry Kane's played the dark arts a bit there
[3228.84 - 3230.84] P:1767.76 E:0.085728 |  with his reaction?
[3230.84 - 3232.84] P:2004.89 E:0.108141 |  Well, do you know what, Izzy?
[3232.84 - 3234.84] P:1881.58 E:0.102237 |  I'm not playing him one little bit, but he's got up
[3234.84 - 3236.84] P:1783.28 E:0.096322 |  and he's taken the penalty, so he's OK, isn't he?
[3236.84 - 3239.84] P:1910.04 E:0.103716 |  I was going to ask you that, because you will have had eyes on him
[3239.84 - 3241.84] P:1977.21 E:0.098392 |  all the way through that, because he was very near you,
[3241.84 - 3244.84] P:1815.27 E:0.082391 |  and he hobbled, and he hobbled, and he hobbled
[3244.84 - 3248.84] P:1946.02 E:0.086851 |  all the way through the referee going to the screen.
[3248.84 - 3251.84] P:1911.29 E:0.094673 |  And by the time he'd done the square, he had the ball of the spot.
[3251.84 - 3253.84] P:2149.62 E:0.092935 |  Yeah, but that's fine. He might have hurt his foot.
[3253.84 - 3256.84] P:2047.41 E:0.081219 |  I mean, there was connection, but the connection was through
[3256.84 - 3258.84] P:1988.90 E:0.087892 |  no fault of the defenders. He's just gone to block the ball.
[3258.84 - 3261.84] P:1990.11 E:0.089687 |  The connection was because of the follow-through,
[3261.84 - 3266.84] P:2012.55 E:0.083437 |  so he might have hurt his boot, but I think it's a harsh decision
[3266.84 - 3268.84] P:1970.13 E:0.078828 |  and giving turning that over.
[3268.84 - 3270.84] P:1886.97 E:0.098990 |  I think they're a bit naughty sometimes when you do kick the bottom
[3270.84 - 3273.84] P:1866.76 E:0.086006 |  of someone's studs. It can be quite painful, right?
[3273.84 - 3277.84] P:1881.24 E:0.095797 |  Maybe. Maybe there's a little element of I'll ham it up a little bit,
[3277.84 - 3279.84] P:1796.22 E:0.108987 |  because he did stay down for quite a while.
[3279.84 - 3282.84] P:1751.00 E:0.092315 |  But the review took some time, didn't it?
[3282.84 - 3284.84] P:1715.49 E:0.105988 |  It was a long, old review to have a look at.
[3284.84 - 3286.84] P:1780.99 E:0.110656 |  One all here in Dortmund, then.
[3286.84 - 3290.84] P:1679.32 E:0.088173 |  Netherlands won, England won, interestingly.
[3290.84 - 3294.84] P:1664.10 E:0.105359 |  On the pitch down below, there is one England sub warming up,
[3294.84 - 3296.84] P:1841.14 E:0.086234 |  and that is Luke Shaw.
[3296.84 - 3300.84] P:1928.87 E:0.086084 |  We will see if he comes on for the second half, but at 5-9.
[3300.84 - 3302.84] P:1623.66 E:0.071553 |  Let's get the latest BBC News.

[3316.84 - 3319.84] P:1426.52 E:0.100967 |  The victims are the family of BBC 5 Live's racing commentator,
[3319.84 - 3323.84] P:1774.26 E:0.090398 |  John Hunt. His wife, Carol, and two of their daughters,

[3326.84 - 3329.84] P:1879.30 E:0.068763 |  at a house in Bushey and couldn't be saved.

[3332.84 - 3336.84] P:1718.50 E:0.089250 |  in North London this afternoon and is now receiving medical treatment.
[3336.84 - 3339.84] P:1601.31 E:0.073757 |  Hertfordshire police say no shots were fired by officers.

[3354.84 - 3358.84] P:1690.24 E:0.093194 |  And President Biden has again said that he'll stay in the presidential race
[3358.84 - 3361.84] P:1830.11 E:0.086412 |  after George Clooney said he should stand down.
[3361.84 - 3364.84] P:1337.88 E:0.092408 |  The actor is a long-standing Democratic donor and supporter,
[3364.84 - 3368.84] P:1469.91 E:0.080990 |  but said the party can't win the election with Joe Biden as its candidate.
[3368.84 - 3372.84] P:1543.04 E:0.114490 |  As we know, Jimmy will be hanging up his spikes.
[3372.84 - 3375.84] P:1113.78 E:0.112559 |  We wanted to mark this for the proper sit-down,
[3375.84 - 3379.84] P:1439.15 E:0.122422 |  meticulously researched and planned interview with Jimmy.
[3379.84 - 3381.84] P:1458.72 E:0.119851 |  Are you up for it?

[3421.84 - 3424.84] P:1687.37 E:0.086948 |  Close the opening day on 189 for three.
[3424.84 - 3428.84] P:1770.67 E:0.086885 |  So that's already enough for a lead of 68 over the West Indies.
[3428.84 - 3430.84] P:1776.72 E:0.097732 |  Jimmy Anderson playing this last test match,
[3430.84 - 3432.84] P:1740.48 E:0.083775 |  got the final wicket of the Tourists innings.
[3432.84 - 3434.84] P:1555.79 E:0.085021 |  They were bowled out for just 121.
[3434.84 - 3436.84] P:1601.18 E:0.098774 |  But it was fellow for the West Indies.
[3436.84 - 3438.84] P:1787.96 E:0.083890 |  They were bowled out for just 121.
[3438.84 - 3441.84] P:1760.81 E:0.088039 |  But it was fellow fast bowler and debutant Gus Atkinson,
[3441.84 - 3445.84] P:1625.24 E:0.081596 |  who took 7 for 45 to grab the headlines.
[3445.84 - 3447.84] P:1873.33 E:0.091826 |  It was pretty special.
[3447.84 - 3449.84] P:1751.47 E:0.093003 |  I obviously nerves this morning,
[3449.84 - 3451.84] P:1694.75 E:0.093732 |  but once I got the first wicket out of the way,
[3451.84 - 3454.84] P:1522.31 E:0.079246 |  I could sort of go from there and it went pretty well.
[3454.84 - 3456.84] P:1784.15 E:0.098418 |  What was your plan for that opening over,
[3456.84 - 3459.84] P:1667.35 E:0.079593 |  given that you took a wicket with your second delivery and test cricket?
[3459.84 - 3462.84] P:1917.27 E:0.098922 |  Just to get it down there in a good area.
[3462.84 - 3464.84] P:1680.85 E:0.089202 |  Got the wicket.
[3464.84 - 3468.84] P:1744.96 E:0.092528 |  I wanted to bowl it, but it came off well, so can't complain.
[3468.84 - 3471.84] P:1594.99 E:0.079588 |  What was the feeling at the point you got your first test wicket?
[3471.84 - 3473.84] P:1738.92 E:0.088946 |  A bit of relief, to be honest.
[3473.84 - 3475.84] P:1693.81 E:0.092768 |  Nice to get the first one out of the way quickly.
[3475.84 - 3478.84] P:1733.88 E:0.090545 |  So, yeah, as I said, relief and then went from there.
[3478.84 - 3480.84] P:1805.67 E:0.067775 |  There are some more details on the opening day,
[3480.84 - 3483.84] P:1702.88 E:0.088393 |  with former England captain Michael Vaughan and Jonathan Acre.
[3483.84 - 3485.84] P:1868.41 E:0.076639 |  Close the play of the first day,
[3485.84 - 3487.84] P:1360.06 E:0.084283 |  and England very much in control of this first test match.
[3487.84 - 3489.84] P:1787.71 E:0.091135 |  They lead West Indies by 68.
[3489.84 - 3491.84] P:1695.46 E:0.081139 |  They're 189 for three.
[3491.84 - 3493.84] P:1370.89 E:0.098058 |  Having bundled West Indies out for 121.
[3493.84 - 3495.84] P:1887.28 E:0.062496 |  They were 61 for three.
[3495.84 - 3499.84] P:1704.43 E:0.078541 |  They lost 7 for 60 after lunch, including 6 for 18 at one stage,
[3499.84 - 3501.84] P:1681.32 E:0.090188 |  and four wickets with a score on 88.
[3501.84 - 3503.84] P:1591.83 E:0.093544 |  A bit of a disaster there,
[3503.84 - 3507.84] P:1782.29 E:0.078481 |  as Atkinson in his first test match took three wickets in one over.
[3507.84 - 3509.84] P:1861.52 E:0.067508 |  He got his first wicket in test cricket,
[3509.84 - 3512.84] P:1578.07 E:0.077093 |  but just his second ball, a loose shot from Brathwick, the West Indian captain.
[3512.84 - 3515.84] P:1592.05 E:0.075673 |  He chopped the ball into his stumps, and that got Atkinson away.
[3515.84 - 3517.84] P:1601.02 E:0.099341 |  He finishes 7 for 45.
[3517.84 - 3520.84] P:1713.47 E:0.071448 |  The second-best England figures ever by a debutant,
[3520.84 - 3522.84] P:1681.20 E:0.061643 |  and the best in the first innings.
[3522.84 - 3527.84] P:1705.78 E:0.080742 |  And Jimmy Anderson really reduced to the role of an admiring onlooker at mid-on.
[3527.84 - 3531.84] P:1589.71 E:0.073965 |  He took 1 for 26. That was the number 11 from 10.4.
[3531.84 - 3535.84] P:1553.07 E:0.076538 |  It was a wicket for Wokes, who actually bowed rather better than that.
[3535.84 - 3538.84] P:1142.48 E:0.083639 |  11-0 was 1 for 29. He beat the bat a lot, moved the ball around.
[3538.84 - 3541.84] P:1687.64 E:0.084847 |  Ben Stokes actually was encouraging too. He found some swing.
[3541.84 - 3544.84] P:1789.97 E:0.078154 |  He took 1 for 14. There were some terrific catches in there.
[3544.84 - 3548.84] P:1671.03 E:0.088050 |  Harry Brooks, that is Miss Louis on his debut for 27, a wonderful catch.
[3548.84 - 3554.84] P:1677.61 E:0.066771 |  At third slip, and then Oli Pope as well to catch a hodgepack with points off Wokes.
[3554.84 - 3557.84] P:1793.74 E:0.078068 |  I mentioned a ball really well. Probably the worst ballie ball all day.
[3557.84 - 3561.84] P:1734.40 E:0.066185 |  Cut hard. Should have gone for 4. Pope took a superb catch.
[3561.84 - 3565.84] P:1697.58 E:0.070051 |  So for England, Ducat fell cheaply for 3. Crawley, 76.
[3565.84 - 3569.84] P:1803.25 E:0.068216 |  Pope, 57. At the close, Route 15, Brook, 25.
[3569.84 - 3572.84] P:1434.93 E:0.082533 |  We'll come back tomorrow for some more of the lead-on 68.
[3572.84 - 3575.84] P:1863.62 E:0.079071 |  Michael, your summation of what you've seen today.
[3575.84 - 3578.84] P:1467.50 E:0.072561 |  That's a perfect day from an England perspective.
[3578.84 - 3582.84] P:1514.19 E:0.080680 |  Ben Stokes won the toss. No surprise that he decided to bowl first.
[3582.84 - 3585.84] P:1534.54 E:0.064835 |  The West Indies made a quite good start. It was a nerve, it was, wasn't it?
[3585.84 - 3590.84] P:1712.95 E:0.073724 |  Jimmy Anderson, obviously in his last game, you could tell that there was a little bit of nerves around.
[3590.84 - 3594.84] P:1669.96 E:0.075939 |  The West Indies made a good start. And suddenly when they started to lose one or two,
[3594.84 - 3600.84] P:1844.59 E:0.073762 |  you could see the inexperience, you could see the lack of game time required to play in these conditions.
[3600.84 - 3605.84] P:1545.85 E:0.082411 |  And I will say that if we want the West Indies and these teams to come to the UK to compete,
[3605.84 - 3609.84] P:1738.82 E:0.077161 |  they're not at the standard of what we see from an England side in these conditions.
[3609.84 - 3612.84] P:1493.13 E:0.078231 |  Obviously, I just think they've got to have more game time.
[3612.84 - 3613.84] P:1572.96 E:0.068725 |  Agreed.
[3613.84 - 3617.84] P:1712.37 E:0.073768 |  I just look at that game they played last week. It was against the first-class caret.
[3617.84 - 3620.84] P:1739.41 E:0.080261 |  A lot of young, talented players. Just one game.
[3620.84 - 3622.84] P:1667.32 E:0.085265 |  You look at Schermart and it's not down to the bowlers today.
[3622.84 - 3626.84] P:1599.90 E:0.072472 |  The batter's like the West Indies down to be bowled out for 121 on that surface.
[3626.84 - 3628.84] P:1497.55 E:0.078836 |  Of course, Atkinson, absolutely magnificent.
[3628.84 - 3631.84] P:1664.63 E:0.077654 |  But I just look at the preparation of this West Indies side.
[3631.84 - 3635.84] P:1706.39 E:0.074030 |  I think, couldn't you have come an extra week and couldn't you have given your players two games,
[3635.84 - 3640.84] P:1770.87 E:0.080643 |  at least to get ready for these kind of conditions against the quality that they're going to be up against
[3640.84 - 3644.84] P:1668.79 E:0.080232 |  in the next few weeks? They probably will get better over the course of this Test Match series.
[3644.84 - 3648.84] P:1764.96 E:0.077574 |  But, you know, we really want the West Indies and these sides to come to this.
[3648.84 - 3652.84] P:1707.72 E:0.086285 |  You're shulanchoring a few weeks time to really be competitive and give us a spectacle.
[3652.84 - 3656.84] P:1531.94 E:0.086781 |  It's time schedule. They've got the Caribbean T20. They want the players back for that.
[3656.84 - 3658.84] P:1306.30 E:0.093506 |  I mean, all these things have to be crammed in.
[3658.84 - 3662.84] P:1643.96 E:0.090355 |  I just feel sorry for the players that they just don't seem to get the right preparation
[3662.84 - 3665.84] P:1787.18 E:0.077073 |  for the conditions that they're going to go and play in.
[3665.84 - 3670.84] P:1419.03 E:0.087150 |  You know, we want to see them do very well, but we also want to see a contest.
[3670.84 - 3674.84] P:1613.64 E:0.089653 |  I don't like seeing it. It's been great to see Gorsak and Sinon debut.
[3674.84 - 3678.84] P:1565.08 E:0.074509 |  It looks a real dearly bowl grape. But I don't like seeing days like we've seen today
[3678.84 - 3682.84] P:1643.60 E:0.078496 |  where it just looks so one-sided and we arrive now on day two, which pretty much,
[3682.84 - 3685.84] P:1695.48 E:0.071610 |  let's be honest, we know the result of the Test Match already.
[3685.84 - 3688.84] P:1660.92 E:0.085323 |  And it was just down to the ball didn't do a great deal.
[3688.84 - 3692.84] P:1653.00 E:0.071193 |  It did just enough and it was down to, if you can say to me, there was a jaffa,
[3692.84 - 3697.84] P:1639.91 E:0.079543 |  a genuine jaffa that was bowl today that a West Indian batter couldn't do anything about.
[3697.84 - 3702.84] P:1684.15 E:0.066133 |  I haven't seen it. I just saw a mistake after mistake after mistake.
[3702.84 - 3707.84] P:1559.14 E:0.071330 |  And you have to say that this West Indies side just look ill-prepared to play in these conditions
[3707.84 - 3709.84] P:1701.22 E:0.067902 |  against the quality that they're up against.
[3709.84 - 3713.84] P:1791.29 E:0.093000 |  Michael Vaughan and Jonathan Ang, you've played some more on the TMS pod on BBC Sounds
[3713.84 - 3719.84] P:1728.03 E:0.084506 |  and the team back on air from Lord's at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning on Sports Extra.
[3719.84 - 3725.84] P:1783.35 E:0.083225 |  The team at Wimbledon back on air at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon here on Five Live.
[3725.84 - 3730.84] P:1799.15 E:0.082287 |  Both sets of substitutes now warming up here in Dormund, although Matt Upsons has been
[3730.84 - 3733.84] P:1773.20 E:0.094748 |  keeping a specific eye on Luke Shorin as a warm-up.
[3733.84 - 3736.84] P:1804.76 E:0.077544 |  And look, he's being taped up at the moment. He's coming on.
[3736.84 - 3740.84] P:1709.91 E:0.090029 |  But even based on the warm-up, you said that's someone who's coming on a hard time.
[3740.84 - 3744.84] P:1792.30 E:0.091291 |  Proper warm-up. Lots of sprints, lots of change of directions, movement at the ball,
[3744.84 - 3748.84] P:1770.98 E:0.085477 |  one-on-one with one of the trainers. That is an oncoming-on-to-play warm-up.
[3748.84 - 3750.84] P:1742.45 E:0.079476 |  And yeah, I think he's just getting sorted now.
[3750.84 - 3755.84] P:1744.87 E:0.093965 |  That's an aggressive, I mean, actually, it looks like that Vaghaurs is coming on for the Dutch as well.
[3755.84 - 3759.84] P:1782.46 E:0.089613 |  But from the England point of view, Alan, that's an aggressive substitution.
[3759.84 - 3763.84] P:1720.40 E:0.089575 |  It's like we can do this in 90 minutes here with a bit more width on the left.
[3763.84 - 3767.84] P:1976.47 E:0.096967 |  Yeah, it's a positive substitute because there were two or three times when Kieran Trippier got out there
[3767.84 - 3770.84] P:1847.69 E:0.096159 |  and the ball should have come in. It should have come in quickly.
[3770.84 - 3773.84] P:1888.47 E:0.088989 |  But because he didn't, he was reluctant to use his left foot.
[3773.84 - 3777.84] P:1820.27 E:0.089455 |  He came back on his right and then they went pass, pass, pass over to the right-hand side.
[3777.84 - 3780.84] P:1977.08 E:0.092783 |  On the one occasion where he did try to cross it with a left foot,
[3780.84 - 3782.84] P:1859.63 E:0.086067 |  it goes straight into the goalkeeper's hands.
[3782.84 - 3785.84] P:1973.60 E:0.086139 |  So you're absolutely right. It's a positive substitution.
[3785.84 - 3787.84] P:1591.51 E:0.096942 |  I mean, as a centre forward, there's nothing more frustrating
[3787.84 - 3789.84] P:1860.83 E:0.088773 |  when you've got a great crossing opportunity.
[3789.84 - 3792.84] P:1861.64 E:0.082911 |  You're in the box and it's not getting delivered.
[3792.84 - 3793.84] P:1556.68 E:0.091491 |  I mean, you pull your air out, wouldn't you?
[3793.84 - 3794.84] P:1960.61 E:0.086055 |  If I hadn't, he...
[3796.84 - 3800.84] P:1792.90 E:0.091941 |  And the other thing, just from the Dutch point of view, as he Chris has said,
[3800.84 - 3805.84] P:1693.92 E:0.100573 |  is that Valkvegg-Horse changes things for them, as we have seen in previous games.
[3806.84 - 3808.84] P:1706.94 E:0.100415 |  He's so effective at what he does.
[3808.84 - 3811.84] P:1747.51 E:0.110685 |  It'd be interesting to see who he stands on.
[3811.84 - 3814.84] P:1821.35 E:0.096759 |  If he stands on gay, you're stones, or whether he mixes and matches,
[3814.84 - 3816.84] P:1875.66 E:0.092325 |  depending on where the ball is.
[3816.84 - 3818.84] P:1781.03 E:0.099819 |  But he's a threat and he knows what he's doing.
[3818.84 - 3820.84] P:1748.49 E:0.101154 |  And when the ball's looked into the box,
[3820.84 - 3823.84] P:1682.39 E:0.105498 |  he's so intelligent with the way he nods it down into space
[3823.84 - 3825.84] P:1579.32 E:0.102908 |  for his teammates to run onto.
[3825.84 - 3827.84] P:1586.34 E:0.097848 |  So that is something we definitely have to keep an eye on.
[3828.84 - 3830.84] P:1741.29 E:0.107728 |  Right, John Murray, all yours.
[3832.84 - 3833.84] P:1784.60 E:0.102785 |  Thanks, Mark.
[3833.84 - 3835.84] P:1887.72 E:0.102376 |  So, Vekhorst is on for Marlon.
[3835.84 - 3837.84] P:1719.03 E:0.083026 |  So Marlon's taken off, Matt.
[3837.84 - 3838.84] P:1718.98 E:0.104306 |  Surprised by that?
[3838.84 - 3841.84] P:1660.81 E:0.102105 |  Surprised, because you'd feel that Marlon's almost the perfect foil
[3841.84 - 3843.84] P:1802.51 E:0.092411 |  to be running off of Vekhorst with his pace.
[3843.84 - 3846.84] P:1850.49 E:0.096929 |  I mean, he's had put a lot of energy into that first half,
[3846.84 - 3847.84] P:1845.59 E:0.072240 |  but it's an interesting tap.
[3847.84 - 3850.84] P:1790.87 E:0.102018 |  They really did look like they'd ran out of a little bit of attacking ideas
[3850.84 - 3853.84] P:1932.84 E:0.084362 |  in that passage of play towards the end of the first half.
[3853.84 - 3857.84] P:1958.45 E:0.079480 |  So it doesn't surprise me that Kuhmann's made a change up top.
[3857.84 - 3860.84] P:1937.14 E:0.083200 |  And so, Vekhorst, the Burnley man.
[3861.84 - 3863.84] P:1729.71 E:0.087584 |  Well, I'm not sure we'll see him play for Burnley again,
[3863.84 - 3866.84] P:1625.70 E:0.097710 |  but he's on loan here in Germany with Hopperheim this season.
[3866.84 - 3869.84] P:1816.37 E:0.088195 |  He is on. He's come on as a substitute in every game.
[3869.84 - 3871.84] P:1758.23 E:0.107914 |  And indeed, he came on at halftime in the last match
[3871.84 - 3875.84] P:1645.05 E:0.086003 |  in the quarter-final against Turkey when the Dutch came from behind.
[3875.84 - 3879.84] P:1758.45 E:0.098978 |  And yes, Luxo is on for his 33rd cap
[3881.84 - 3887.84] P:1580.85 E:0.092224 |  after coming on in the 78th minute in the quarter-final against Switzerland.
[3887.84 - 3892.84] P:1620.11 E:0.089599 |  Now he is on at halftime and has both Alan Shearer and Matt Uppsen
[3892.84 - 3895.84] P:1623.10 E:0.102407 |  and Izzy Christensen down behind the goal of said this.
[3895.84 - 3897.84] P:1654.12 E:0.093413 |  It feels like a positive move.
[3897.84 - 3900.84] P:1690.59 E:0.094600 |  The second half begins here under darkening skies.
[3900.84 - 3904.84] P:1717.88 E:0.082873 |  Netherlands won, England won, England in the second half
[3904.84 - 3906.84] P:1740.97 E:0.075083 |  attacking from right to left.
[3906.84 - 3910.84] P:1561.06 E:0.090759 |  So they're attacking towards the mass of orange in the stands here,
[3910.84 - 3912.84] P:1601.45 E:0.104713 |  over 60,000 people.
[3912.84 - 3915.84] P:1577.04 E:0.095514 |  And the majority, I think, are Dutch supporters.
[3915.84 - 3919.84] P:1704.67 E:0.092911 |  Lots of empty seats still at the start of the second half
[3919.84 - 3923.84] P:1468.95 E:0.099478 |  as John Stones is hacked down by Vekhorst.
[3924.84 - 3929.84] P:1665.87 E:0.100771 |  What you're also seeing is Bellingham is playing more on the left-hand side as well,
[3929.84 - 3932.84] P:1833.59 E:0.094052 |  which has then given them more space in that middle
[3932.84 - 3935.84] P:1589.55 E:0.097211 |  for like we saw in the first half in Manu and Phil Ford.
[3935.84 - 3938.84] P:1841.35 E:0.099363 |  And so you'll see a switch, have no doubt, from playing a three
[3938.84 - 3940.84] P:1619.20 E:0.100651 |  and then playing a four at the back with Luxo.
[3940.84 - 3943.84] P:1764.48 E:0.098358 |  I know he's in the forward position at the moment,
[3943.84 - 3945.84] P:1722.04 E:0.089207 |  but he could also play in the four as well,
[3945.84 - 3948.84] P:1688.34 E:0.099828 |  which will free someone else up further forward.
[3948.84 - 3950.84] P:1586.92 E:0.101486 |  This is five-live BBC Sounds.
[3950.84 - 3952.84] P:1708.94 E:0.109135 |  BBC World Service are with us as well.
[3952.84 - 3955.84] P:1374.73 E:0.089609 |  Welcome to you wherever you're listening
[3955.84 - 3959.84] P:1515.89 E:0.092216 |  on what is actually a very pleasant night now.
[3959.84 - 3962.84] P:1442.84 E:0.112746 |  It's a little coolish tinge in the air here, dry at the moment.
[3962.84 - 3965.84] P:1364.00 E:0.105770 |  Manu, very impressive in the first half, plays the full forward,
[3965.84 - 3967.84] P:1625.00 E:0.106983 |  but it's blocked out of play for a throw into England,
[3967.84 - 3969.84] P:1531.85 E:0.103035 |  half inside their own heart.
[3969.84 - 3971.84] P:1498.63 E:0.100220 |  So the Netherlands now, the brookening goal,
[3971.84 - 3974.84] P:1540.56 E:0.095734 |  still the same back four, Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk and Ake.
[3974.84 - 3979.84] P:1470.83 E:0.087812 |  And then in midfield, Schouten, Reinders and Vierman.
[3979.84 - 3982.84] P:1582.02 E:0.100618 |  And then Siemens, Bijkhorst and Gackpul, it is now.
[3982.84 - 3985.84] P:1600.75 E:0.094964 |  And Ronald Koeman used two of his substitutes.
[3985.84 - 3988.84] P:1553.24 E:0.098389 |  And England with Pickford and Gull, Walker-Stones and Gay,
[3988.84 - 3990.84] P:1585.80 E:0.088214 |  Sakaran, Shaw in the wide areas,
[3990.84 - 3994.84] P:1576.02 E:0.094539 |  Manu and Rice in the middle, Fordon, Bellingham and Keane.
[3994.84 - 3999.84] P:1338.52 E:0.102302 |  That was Kara Southgate's first change of the night.
[3999.84 - 4003.84] P:1559.53 E:0.108310 |  Here is Luxo, into the action, having not played since the middle of February.
[4003.84 - 4006.84] P:1520.08 E:0.093872 |  Shaw clips one for it for Bellingham to chase.
[4006.84 - 4011.84] P:1498.63 E:0.108611 |  De Vrij has gone with him, and the ball is bouncing through
[4011.84 - 4014.84] P:1546.25 E:0.100763 |  off the England man for a goal kick to the Dutch
[4014.84 - 4016.84] P:1603.80 E:0.100503 |  and a huge cheer from all of those people behind that goal.
[4016.84 - 4019.84] P:1620.67 E:0.097248 |  I don't mind that though, at least the defenders running towards
[4019.84 - 4021.84] P:1707.92 E:0.107306 |  his own goal, we haven't seen enough of that in any way,
[4021.84 - 4023.84] P:1660.14 E:0.098377 |  in the previous games.
[4023.84 - 4025.84] P:1471.00 E:0.082596 |  It's good to see.
[4026.84 - 4032.84] P:1489.81 E:0.103456 |  So a goal kick that will be tapped square by Van Dijk to Februggen.
[4032.84 - 4036.84] P:1469.53 E:0.092692 |  And then Virgil Van Dijk kicks it away.
[4036.84 - 4040.84] P:1630.99 E:0.098449 |  And the ball is hit forward for the Dutch,
[4040.84 - 4043.84] P:1585.50 E:0.101598 |  but that will just bounce all the way through to Pickford.
[4043.84 - 4045.84] P:1567.20 E:0.105579 |  You're thinking that they've gone to a three.
[4045.84 - 4050.84] P:1631.78 E:0.102871 |  I think England have gone, I think, more to a four at the back,
[4050.84 - 4054.84] P:1563.55 E:0.100311 |  which has certainly pushed Sakaran into a really wide forward position
[4054.84 - 4057.84] P:1487.51 E:0.100086 |  and Bellingham's come to the left of Harry Keane.
[4058.84 - 4061.84] P:1408.98 E:0.108196 |  Yeah, here is Gay with the ball in his back,
[4061.84 - 4064.84] P:1631.73 E:0.095106 |  just taps it forward towards Rice,
[4064.84 - 4067.84] P:1476.56 E:0.112829 |  and then across it goes to John Stones.
[4067.84 - 4071.84] P:1426.67 E:0.103484 |  Again, Stones has been closed down by Begg Horst.
[4071.84 - 4076.84] P:1477.71 E:0.101038 |  Stones gave him a right glare when Begg Horst put in that early challenge
[4076.84 - 4078.84] P:1577.27 E:0.079476 |  on Stones.
[4078.84 - 4081.84] P:1602.35 E:0.099996 |  Begg Horst, before the match came out, he was the first man out,
[4081.84 - 4083.84] P:1387.50 E:0.105736 |  the Dutch players, he went straight to the Orange Wall,
[4083.84 - 4086.84] P:1467.92 E:0.101896 |  he was leading the cheering, as the ball is thrown forward for Sakaran.
[4086.84 - 4089.84] P:1601.69 E:0.093144 |  Sakar pulls it back across the penalty area, but it lands first,
[4089.84 - 4091.84] P:1570.08 E:0.102675 |  shouting.
[4091.84 - 4094.84] P:1620.06 E:0.106613 |  Begg Horst has come back into his own half,
[4094.84 - 4096.84] P:1722.63 E:0.116619 |  Simon's was caught out of position,
[4096.84 - 4098.84] P:1793.87 E:0.117218 |  but he was caught the wrong side of the ball,
[4098.84 - 4100.84] P:1559.22 E:0.098666 |  but then Shaw put in the challenge, took him over,
[4100.84 - 4102.84] P:1608.42 E:0.103128 |  and it's a free kick for the Dutch.
[4102.84 - 4104.84] P:1523.35 E:0.102081 |  I don't think any of the England players thought or expected Sakar
[4104.84 - 4107.84] P:1534.50 E:0.103268 |  to get that ball, because none of them attacked it into the box.
[4107.84 - 4109.84] P:1637.23 E:0.103862 |  He did really well in keeping it in and pulling it back
[4109.84 - 4111.84] P:1454.89 E:0.080577 |  towards the penalty spot.
[4111.84 - 4114.84] P:1513.06 E:0.100111 |  So the Dutch take their quick free kick,
[4114.84 - 4116.84] P:1473.49 E:0.084068 |  and there is
[4116.84 - 4118.84] P:1620.20 E:0.106743 |  Dumfries, who hit the post,
[4118.84 - 4121.84] P:1367.85 E:0.103060 |  the top of the post with a header from the corner in the first half,
[4121.84 - 4124.84] P:1349.40 E:0.099318 |  and then De Vrij,
[4124.84 - 4128.84] P:1567.16 E:0.101306 |  as the root hullet lookalike just walks past us,
[4128.84 - 4131.84] P:1403.40 E:0.098760 |  remarkably like root hullet.
[4131.84 - 4134.84] P:1522.62 E:0.098433 |  Here is Shouten,
[4134.84 - 4137.84] P:1549.53 E:0.108434 |  now to Simon's on the right-hand side, Shaw is able to intercept that pass,
[4137.84 - 4140.84] P:1388.12 E:0.111190 |  Ballinger gives it back to Luke Shaw,
[4140.84 - 4143.84] P:1463.29 E:0.115728 |  England in the white shirts, blue shorts and white socks tonight,
[4143.84 - 4145.84] P:1275.19 E:0.112478 |  and then a nice pass,
[4145.84 - 4147.84] P:1459.10 E:0.117720 |  and then a nice pass to De Vrij,
[4147.84 - 4149.84] P:1551.64 E:0.111961 |  still deep inside his own half-wings,
[4149.84 - 4151.84] P:1486.61 E:0.107074 |  a throw-in of Dumfries.
[4151.84 - 4153.84] P:1483.09 E:0.100713 |  I think you can buy those weeks down there,
[4153.84 - 4155.84] P:1536.83 E:0.107926 |  John, those root hullet ones.
[4155.84 - 4157.84] P:1471.13 E:0.103365 |  Yeah, but he had the moustache as well.
[4157.84 - 4159.84] P:1382.20 E:0.109055 |  Yeah, it might be a nice little addition at some point.
[4159.84 - 4161.84] P:1791.48 E:0.108633 |  Do you think so? Do you think he's come to that stage?
[4161.84 - 4163.84] P:1699.76 E:0.101325 |  Alan?
[4163.84 - 4165.84] P:1630.26 E:0.102824 |  You and Al.
[4165.84 - 4167.84] P:1637.38 E:0.100022 |  We'll get two for the two, but at the base of one, John.
[4167.84 - 4169.84] P:1731.94 E:0.113773 |  Not sure I could see Alan Shearer
[4169.84 - 4171.84] P:1382.11 E:0.098985 |  in a root hullet,
[4171.84 - 4173.84] P:1495.79 E:0.096535 |  but he's got a nice little bit of a strike now.
[4173.84 - 4175.84] P:1655.52 E:0.083408 |  Yeah, Netherlands won,
[4175.84 - 4177.84] P:1537.66 E:0.095043 |  England won,
[4177.84 - 4179.84] P:1588.73 E:0.100600 |  and Orange splashed all around the stands,
[4179.84 - 4181.84] P:1538.06 E:0.111063 |  here in Dortmund,
[4181.84 - 4183.84] P:1514.61 E:0.110514 |  blood light's taking effect.
[4183.84 - 4185.84] P:1451.49 E:0.107626 |  Mark Gay now with the ball at his feet,
[4185.84 - 4187.84] P:1628.36 E:0.103588 |  Harry Kane comes short,
[4187.84 - 4189.84] P:1523.67 E:0.104176 |  Harry Kane equalising in the first half
[4189.84 - 4191.84] P:1712.43 E:0.098051 |  with his 66th goal for England,
[4191.84 - 4193.84] P:1581.61 E:0.102671 |  Long and Ford from Gay looking for the run of Luke Shaw,
[4193.84 - 4195.84] P:1402.55 E:0.098954 |  but that's dealt with by the head of Dumfries,
[4195.84 - 4197.84] P:1530.07 E:0.097540 |  and then Shouten in field,
[4197.84 - 4199.84] P:1479.21 E:0.108507 |  Rice is chasing,
[4199.84 - 4201.84] P:1516.68 E:0.098331 |  and gets a header forward,
[4201.84 - 4203.84] P:1748.91 E:0.100506 |  Forden stretching for it,
[4203.84 - 4205.84] P:1767.09 E:0.107619 |  and then Forden is a judge,
[4205.84 - 4207.84] P:1603.09 E:0.084540 |  who is actually in an offside position,
[4207.84 - 4209.84] P:1311.39 E:0.104800 |  so it's a free kick to the Dutch off inside their own half.
[4209.84 - 4211.84] P:1387.97 E:0.110332 |  Not quite had the flow in the second half,
[4211.84 - 4213.84] P:1570.82 E:0.089897 |  and those changes that Ronald Koumen has made,
[4213.84 - 4215.84] P:1502.46 E:0.090362 |  they were given at times
[4215.84 - 4217.84] P:1594.83 E:0.111178 |  a little bit of a chasing by England
[4217.84 - 4219.84] P:1437.53 E:0.102291 |  in the first half,
[4219.84 - 4221.84] P:1457.69 E:0.089955 |  so it's a tactical response
[4221.84 - 4223.84] P:1396.41 E:0.088774 |  by the wily Ronald Koumen
[4223.84 - 4225.84] P:1445.94 E:0.106977 |  in his second spell
[4225.84 - 4227.84] P:1332.84 E:0.108093 |  as coach in the Netherlands side,
[4227.84 - 4229.84] P:1328.38 E:0.108416 |  and the 20 finals
[4229.84 - 4231.84] P:1384.07 E:0.097108 |  means as he was gleefully pointing out himself
[4231.84 - 4233.84] P:1560.91 E:0.097144 |  that a clause in his contract has been triggered,
[4233.84 - 4235.84] P:1413.11 E:0.091673 |  which means that he'll be coach until
[4235.84 - 4237.84] P:1494.07 E:0.098505 |  2026 in the World Cup
[4237.84 - 4239.84] P:1332.37 E:0.089276 |  in North America,
[4239.84 - 4241.84] P:1493.30 E:0.091872 |  Northern Central America.
[4241.84 - 4243.84] P:1527.58 E:0.105526 |  Here's Dumfries, left put a ball forward to Beckhorst.
[4243.84 - 4245.84] P:1516.80 E:0.109803 |  Stones allowed it to bounce into him,
[4245.84 - 4247.84] P:1705.96 E:0.110369 |  but Stones takes it away, had to be quick there,
[4247.84 - 4249.84] P:1584.75 E:0.093456 |  then was clipped by Reinders,
[4249.84 - 4251.84] P:1584.79 E:0.101643 |  that kept his feet,
[4251.84 - 4253.84] P:1639.44 E:0.111060 |  and John Stones still with the ball,
[4253.84 - 4255.84] P:1647.81 E:0.104631 |  goes back towards the edge of the penalty area.
[4255.84 - 4257.84] P:1500.83 E:0.105883 |  Such an important man for Garis Southgate
[4257.84 - 4259.84] P:1367.67 E:0.099120 |  over these four tournaments,
[4259.84 - 4261.84] P:1500.39 E:0.099352 |  started every single match,
[4261.84 - 4263.84] P:1514.16 E:0.094282 |  World Cup Euros, World Cup Euros,
[4263.84 - 4265.84] P:1337.05 E:0.101285 |  and here they are again, England,
[4265.84 - 4267.84] P:1332.22 E:0.103355 |  in the semifinal,
[4267.84 - 4269.84] P:1544.90 E:0.089251 |  World Cup, in the semifinal,
[4269.84 - 4271.84] P:1624.44 E:0.115110 |  three years ago, the Euros, remember,
[4271.84 - 4273.84] P:1505.09 E:0.102346 |  England went behind in that match as well,
[4273.84 - 4275.84] P:1515.35 E:0.102412 |  to that excellent free kick from Damsegaard,
[4275.84 - 4277.84] P:1511.23 E:0.101032 |  and eventually against the Danes,
[4277.84 - 4279.84] P:1456.28 E:0.090596 |  won it an extra time when
[4279.84 - 4281.84] P:1474.81 E:0.105140 |  Harry Kane scored from the penalty
[4281.84 - 4283.84] P:1552.50 E:0.098326 |  that was saved by Kasper Schmeichel.
[4283.84 - 4285.84] P:1464.84 E:0.099199 |  Here's Rice,
[4285.84 - 4287.84] P:1480.10 E:0.104512 |  then back to
[4287.84 - 4289.84] P:1478.01 E:0.098063 |  Rice again from Shaw,
[4289.84 - 4291.84] P:1661.01 E:0.089930 |  that semifinal victory,
[4291.84 - 4293.84] P:1689.79 E:0.098111 |  England's first tournament
[4293.84 - 4295.84] P:1604.10 E:0.098315 |  semifinal victory since 1966.
[4295.84 - 4297.84] P:1449.03 E:0.098753 |  Rice, across to Gay,
[4297.84 - 4299.84] P:1521.32 E:0.097331 |  England in possession,
[4299.84 - 4301.84] P:1389.46 E:0.095654 |  enjoying the possession,
[4301.84 - 4303.84] P:1567.88 E:0.107161 |  Walker, then out to Sacher on the right-hand side,
[4303.84 - 4305.84] P:1546.89 E:0.093323 |  Sacher again, very, very wide,
[4305.84 - 4307.84] P:1414.04 E:0.100019 |  noticeably wide,
[4307.84 - 4309.84] P:1611.85 E:0.080504 |  Nathan Ackicows with him,
[4309.84 - 4311.84] P:1482.70 E:0.091976 |  so the pass is back to Mark Gay,
[4311.84 - 4313.84] P:1498.15 E:0.107280 |  who will pick out Bellingham,
[4313.84 - 4315.84] P:1496.11 E:0.098216 |  drop a little deeper there,
[4315.84 - 4317.84] P:1468.56 E:0.092230 |  Bellingham receives it, and then sets off,
[4317.84 - 4319.84] P:1543.00 E:0.098573 |  plays the ball in field towards Thoden,
[4319.84 - 4321.84] P:1595.63 E:0.094142 |  Thoden trying to find a position,
[4321.84 - 4323.84] P:1643.74 E:0.097249 |  gives it to Shaw, Shaw's ball across,
[4323.84 - 4325.84] P:1736.68 E:0.107916 |  that's blocked by Gunn-Free,
[4325.84 - 4327.84] P:1512.66 E:0.100480 |  throw nice into play from Thoden,
[4327.84 - 4329.84] P:1772.80 E:0.110482 |  Bellingham, Shaw.
[4329.84 - 4331.84] P:1695.10 E:0.092820 |  That's where you want to get Luke Shaw,
[4331.84 - 4333.84] P:1531.47 E:0.096020 |  he tries to put it in first time,
[4333.84 - 4335.84] P:1554.09 E:0.102243 |  but it's just blocked.
[4335.84 - 4337.84] P:1723.83 E:0.105850 |  Makes England look almost totally different,
[4337.84 - 4339.84] P:1425.77 E:0.095614 |  in terms of the balance,
[4339.84 - 4341.84] P:1595.27 E:0.080569 |  that all tournament.
[4341.84 - 4343.84] P:1465.52 E:0.073471 |  Here's Rice, now to Thoden,
[4343.84 - 4345.84] P:1537.95 E:0.095893 |  again, who is over here to the left-hand side,
[4345.84 - 4347.84] P:1464.15 E:0.103780 |  goes back into the England half,
[4347.84 - 4349.84] P:1455.49 E:0.108995 |  Rice,
[4349.84 - 4351.84] P:1514.95 E:0.100605 |  the England supporters,
[4351.84 - 4353.84] P:1341.00 E:0.109667 |  getting their opportunity
[4353.84 - 4355.84] P:1494.20 E:0.103649 |  to pick out the Dutch fans,
[4355.84 - 4357.84] P:1428.33 E:0.089838 |  Kane bounces to Begg host,
[4357.84 - 4359.84] P:1505.82 E:0.114623 |  and now Reinders will bring that forward,
[4359.84 - 4361.84] P:1714.42 E:0.112721 |  he was took back there by Rice,
[4361.84 - 4363.84] P:1762.61 E:0.088340 |  Reinders though, kept his feet,
[4363.84 - 4365.84] P:1874.77 E:0.092600 |  played it forward to Simon,
[4365.84 - 4367.84] P:1730.51 E:0.104489 |  Simon's the man who scored the opening goal
[4367.84 - 4369.84] P:1728.99 E:0.096294 |  and the semi-final,
[4369.84 - 4371.84] P:1740.04 E:0.088984 |  Reinders then passes
[4371.84 - 4373.84] P:1758.96 E:0.112413 |  between Gunn-Free and Seamhams,
[4373.84 - 4375.84] P:1860.93 E:0.108983 |  and the three of them have a right going each other,
[4375.84 - 4377.84] P:1875.08 E:0.097982 |  out of play for a throw.
[4377.84 - 4379.84] P:1894.38 E:0.102100 |  Begg host wants the ball in early,
[4379.84 - 4381.84] P:1862.61 E:0.093907 |  that's what he demands,
[4381.84 - 4383.84] P:1813.59 E:0.101944 |  Seamhams tries to go around Geary,
[4383.84 - 4385.84] P:1521.90 E:0.066553 |  but there's just no way around him.
[4385.84 - 4387.84] P:1568.30 E:0.092774 |  So it's a throw into England,
[4387.84 - 4389.84] P:1576.43 E:0.100315 |  Begg host certainly has a presence,
[4389.84 - 4391.84] P:1526.35 E:0.094608 |  isn't he, 6'6".
[4391.84 - 4393.84] P:1471.73 E:0.097859 |  He also, we noticed, had an absolutely massive
[4393.84 - 4395.84] P:1568.01 E:0.096766 |  earring hanging off his right
[4395.84 - 4397.84] P:1635.57 E:0.092455 |  lop,
[4397.84 - 4399.84] P:1617.20 E:0.099403 |  it's like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean,
[4399.84 - 4401.84] P:1615.86 E:0.104651 |  throwing, the shore
[4401.84 - 4403.84] P:1602.72 E:0.097063 |  is going to take,
[4403.84 - 4405.84] P:1477.80 E:0.104568 |  shore up to Kane, but it's headed forward by Diveraille,
[4405.84 - 4407.84] P:1481.29 E:0.101940 |  chested down by Luke Shaw,
[4407.84 - 4409.84] P:1451.67 E:0.104771 |  and followed forward,
[4409.84 - 4411.84] P:1601.01 E:0.101754 |  Bellingham brings that down,
[4411.84 - 4413.84] P:1596.50 E:0.091877 |  Cuman says that was a handball,
[4413.84 - 4415.84] P:1500.48 E:0.091376 |  the referee didn't see it,
[4415.84 - 4417.84] P:1407.75 E:0.087894 |  and then Manu receives it,
[4417.84 - 4419.84] P:1424.05 E:0.103985 |  in a very tight area here,
[4419.84 - 4421.84] P:1558.09 E:0.107755 |  Seamhams puts in the challenge,
[4421.84 - 4423.84] P:1566.51 E:0.100423 |  and Kobe Manu knocks it down the line,
[4423.84 - 4425.84] P:1583.13 E:0.115099 |  to the Dutch half-windside,
[4425.84 - 4427.84] P:1705.04 E:0.087148 |  the score still 1-1, Matt Upsen.
[4427.84 - 4429.84] P:1670.62 E:0.097077 |  Interesting, I think England are close
[4429.84 - 4431.84] P:1375.79 E:0.090873 |  to this 60% possession in this game,
[4431.84 - 4433.84] P:1465.62 E:0.097102 |  which tells you how well we have played,
[4433.84 - 4435.84] P:1462.49 E:0.097089 |  we've been in a different animal
[4435.84 - 4437.84] P:1510.96 E:0.084582 |  with the ball,
[4437.84 - 4439.84] P:1573.87 E:0.107637 |  the confidence, the way the players
[4439.84 - 4441.84] P:1494.77 E:0.101686 |  are zipping it around,
[4441.84 - 4443.84] P:1398.38 E:0.110611 |  the changing information has had an impact,
[4443.84 - 4445.84] P:1478.91 E:0.112450 |  you feel, it is balanced with Luke Shaw,
[4445.84 - 4447.84] P:1413.94 E:0.101568 |  but it hasn't quite got that fluency
[4447.84 - 4449.84] P:1612.59 E:0.106463 |  of the first half, but the Dutch are really
[4449.84 - 4451.84] P:1419.92 E:0.104652 |  sitting in, unless there's a breakaway
[4451.84 - 4453.84] P:1275.58 E:0.097665 |  in that piece, that for me is the only
[4453.84 - 4455.84] P:1569.12 E:0.101845 |  way they can be a threat at the moment.
[4455.84 - 4457.84] P:1624.96 E:0.110263 |  So it is Dumfries,
[4457.84 - 4459.84] P:1436.75 E:0.101164 |  who will just knock the ball back
[4459.84 - 4461.84] P:1215.25 E:0.114217 |  to De Bruy on the edge of his penalty area,
[4461.84 - 4463.84] P:1183.31 E:0.110467 |  and indeed all the way
[4463.84 - 4465.84] P:1404.19 E:0.112239 |  back to Verbruggen, who's made a couple
[4465.84 - 4467.84] P:1300.37 E:0.102827 |  of decent saves, could save from Harry Kane
[4467.84 - 4469.84] P:1246.27 E:0.098077 |  in the early stages,
[4469.84 - 4471.84] P:1385.36 E:0.110882 |  kept out Phil Forden as well,
[4471.84 - 4473.84] P:1419.39 E:0.105385 |  Forden hit the post, had a ball stopped
[4473.84 - 4475.84] P:1358.41 E:0.108346 |  on the line as well, after a brilliant piece
[4475.84 - 4477.84] P:1306.17 E:0.108726 |  of play, the highlights of this tonight,
[4477.84 - 4479.84] P:1453.02 E:0.108831 |  by the way, on BBC One after the news,
[4479.84 - 4481.84] P:1372.06 E:0.099148 |  on the iPlayer, hope you've been enjoying
[4481.84 - 4483.84] P:1466.09 E:0.113737 |  all of our coverage from here in Germany
[4483.84 - 4485.84] P:1467.40 E:0.099335 |  of the Euros, across the
[4485.84 - 4487.84] P:1344.54 E:0.105874 |  various BBC platforms,
[4487.84 - 4489.84] P:1435.15 E:0.104295 |  and here's Rice, just in front
[4489.84 - 4491.84] P:1417.66 E:0.103866 |  of where Garry Southgate is, is watching,
[4491.84 - 4493.84] P:1489.84 E:0.101123 |  the ball is just touched out of play
[4493.84 - 4495.84] P:1598.37 E:0.105510 |  for a throw in that Luke Shaw will take
[4495.84 - 4497.84] P:1361.22 E:0.103841 |  back to Mark Gay, who gets it down,
[4497.84 - 4499.84] P:1527.22 E:0.111526 |  all of the reaction to whatever happens
[4499.84 - 4501.84] P:1479.21 E:0.099279 |  on the football daily at the Euros,
[4501.84 - 4503.84] P:1487.03 E:0.101493 |  when Runeys
[4503.84 - 4505.84] P:1486.78 E:0.118252 |  Euro 2004 on there as well,
[4505.84 - 4507.84] P:1353.75 E:0.088644 |  here is Gay
[4507.84 - 4509.84] P:1579.77 E:0.102167 |  across the stones, now to the right-hand side,
[4509.84 - 4511.84] P:1193.92 E:0.111613 |  to walk out, walk out
[4511.84 - 4513.84] P:1357.57 E:0.092305 |  with a long pass that Ackie gets
[4513.84 - 4515.84] P:1482.16 E:0.108247 |  his thigh to, Kane in on the challenge
[4515.84 - 4517.84] P:1456.84 E:0.100511 |  and Ackie just kept possession,
[4517.84 - 4519.84] P:1594.49 E:0.106035 |  and then used to Vry on the edge
[4519.84 - 4521.84] P:1522.23 E:0.101614 |  of the box, dumb free, says England,
[4521.84 - 4523.84] P:1332.31 E:0.100284 |  press them in there, but up it goes
[4523.84 - 4525.84] P:1453.05 E:0.103708 |  towards Beggos, John Stones with his hands
[4525.84 - 4527.84] P:1541.00 E:0.097193 |  in the back, with the big man, but Beggos
[4527.84 - 4529.84] P:1442.68 E:0.103354 |  does well, Siemens then curves it forward,
[4529.84 - 4531.84] P:1632.84 E:0.099008 |  but Shaw is able to pass it, and then
[4531.84 - 4533.84] P:1763.98 E:0.100260 |  John Stones takes it up again.
[4533.84 - 4535.84] P:1727.89 E:0.108652 |  Yeah, it was good hold of play from Beggos,
[4535.84 - 4537.84] P:1661.95 E:0.101521 |  that's one of the reasons why he's brought in
[4537.84 - 4539.84] P:1561.23 E:0.108159 |  into the game, but there's not enough runners
[4539.84 - 4541.84] P:1621.36 E:0.100433 |  that were going in behind and England had it covered.
[4541.84 - 4543.84] P:1719.57 E:0.102612 |  They've certainly had more possession
[4543.84 - 4545.84] P:1549.71 E:0.091067 |  without carrying that threat that they had
[4545.84 - 4547.84] P:1606.61 E:0.078644 |  in the first half.
[4547.84 - 4551.84] P:1659.69 E:0.104971 |  So England begin to move forward again.
[4551.84 - 4553.84] P:1665.66 E:0.095685 |  Here is the tall figure,
[4553.84 - 4555.84] P:1629.43 E:0.112419 |  Jude Dillingham with those big gaping
[4555.84 - 4557.84] P:1468.75 E:0.109570 |  holes in the back of his right sops,
[4557.84 - 4559.84] P:1477.25 E:0.095511 |  Dillingham again,
[4559.84 - 4561.84] P:1475.22 E:0.085744 |  just 21 to Luke Shaw,
[4561.84 - 4563.84] P:1448.98 E:0.105943 |  then back to
[4563.84 - 4565.84] P:1598.78 E:0.103745 |  Mark Gay,
[4565.84 - 4567.84] P:1574.57 E:0.105492 |  Cobby Manu comes short,
[4567.84 - 4569.84] P:1457.38 E:0.109218 |  still in the central third,
[4569.84 - 4571.84] P:1251.46 E:0.105832 |  then Declan Rice just
[4571.84 - 4573.84] P:1341.14 E:0.112607 |  adjusts himself,
[4573.84 - 4575.84] P:1099.82 E:0.106605 |  and passes it to Foden,
[4575.84 - 4577.84] P:1388.10 E:0.116465 |  who's dropped deep here,
[4577.84 - 4579.84] P:1171.46 E:0.112918 |  Foden looking up,
[4579.84 - 4581.84] P:1221.61 E:0.117966 |  with
[4581.84 - 4583.84] P:1534.51 E:0.123891 |  Thiem in front of him, still Foden,
[4583.84 - 4585.84] P:1310.76 E:0.105828 |  back it goes,
[4585.84 - 4587.84] P:1350.86 E:0.110940 |  and now England try to start again
[4587.84 - 4589.84] P:1491.65 E:0.103351 |  down the right-hand side, Walker actually gets
[4589.84 - 4591.84] P:1310.46 E:0.093392 |  his head down and sets up on a run,
[4591.84 - 4593.84] P:1416.58 E:0.087134 |  and then has to check back,
[4593.84 - 4595.84] P:1084.90 E:0.100004 |  and then back into his own half
[4595.84 - 4597.84] P:1324.26 E:0.126746 |  it goes. They've certainly become
[4597.84 - 4599.84] P:1659.75 E:0.116518 |  more solid, haven't they, the Dutch in the
[4599.84 - 4601.84] P:1452.10 E:0.114942 |  second half. Dillman came on
[4601.84 - 4603.84] P:1560.58 E:0.114058 |  towards the edge of the first period
[4603.84 - 4605.84] P:1344.88 E:0.089061 |  for DePy,
[4605.84 - 4607.84] P:1475.66 E:0.099150 |  Mark Gay,
[4607.84 - 4609.84] P:1388.09 E:0.093213 |  there's a
[4609.84 - 4611.84] P:1402.97 E:0.102434 |  deafening noise that's coming out of the
[4611.84 - 4613.84] P:1502.68 E:0.096896 |  Dutch fans.
[4613.84 - 4615.84] P:1467.35 E:0.110499 |  Now down the right-hand side with the
[4615.84 - 4617.84] P:1421.44 E:0.107719 |  cross from Walker,
[4617.84 - 4619.84] P:1400.84 E:0.107150 |  that is Bob Block bounces away, Cobby Manu
[4619.84 - 4621.84] P:1239.87 E:0.103043 |  gets that down to his feet,
[4621.84 - 4623.84] P:1314.80 E:0.101358 |  Manu, and England again
[4623.84 - 4625.84] P:1380.93 E:0.107730 |  go back towards the
[4625.84 - 4627.84] P:1377.55 E:0.089405 |  central defenders.
[4627.84 - 4629.84] P:1663.32 E:0.108241 |  I think Mark Gay
[4629.84 - 4631.84] P:1613.19 E:0.095713 |  says, just roll it to me, which he does,
[4631.84 - 4633.84] P:1668.47 E:0.106028 |  and Mark Gay is going to take it on through
[4633.84 - 4635.84] P:1449.82 E:0.091065 |  the middle, Cain comes deep, he's the middle
[4635.84 - 4637.84] P:1319.01 E:0.109770 |  of the half at the moment, the England captain,
[4637.84 - 4639.84] P:1216.17 E:0.110887 |  with his yellow boots playing the fall out
[4639.84 - 4641.84] P:1390.30 E:0.102987 |  towards Walker, and out of the right-hand side
[4641.84 - 4643.84] P:1537.88 E:0.103029 |  to Foden, who just moves away from Gatpole,
[4643.84 - 4645.84] P:1520.35 E:0.090161 |  Foden again, with that quick
[4645.84 - 4647.84] P:1377.02 E:0.096336 |  slick footwork that we've seen
[4647.84 - 4649.84] P:1267.32 E:0.102780 |  from the Manchester City fan,
[4649.84 - 4651.84] P:1464.61 E:0.104411 |  player to such great effect in this match.
[4651.84 - 4653.84] P:1501.98 E:0.107589 |  Cain is then challenged by
[4653.84 - 4655.84] P:1552.93 E:0.106464 |  DeVry, who enjoyed that,
[4655.84 - 4657.84] P:1452.64 E:0.108097 |  and it's out of play on the half-way line.
[4657.84 - 4659.84] P:1470.48 E:0.115711 |  Good defending from DeVry, it's the right ball
[4659.84 - 4661.84] P:1529.67 E:0.107380 |  in so Cain just tries to hold him off and then
[4661.84 - 4663.84] P:1608.70 E:0.093571 |  just clip the ball around, but
[4663.84 - 4665.84] P:1624.54 E:0.109812 |  DeVry's having none of it, he's tight and not leaving
[4665.84 - 4667.84] P:1545.93 E:0.100142 |  him at all, it's a good block.
[4667.84 - 4669.84] P:1640.65 E:0.116959 |  Yeah, they're a really experienced pair,
[4669.84 - 4671.84] P:1453.31 E:0.093466 |  those two aren't they, Van Dijk and
[4671.84 - 4673.84] P:1422.38 E:0.108074 |  Stefan DeVry,
[4673.84 - 4675.84] P:1571.56 E:0.099807 |  now Luke Shaw, just down in front of
[4675.84 - 4677.84] P:1455.99 E:0.097805 |  us, White Sox, just
[4677.84 - 4679.84] P:1572.75 E:0.114573 |  three-quarters of the way down his
[4679.84 - 4681.84] P:1493.41 E:0.099157 |  calves, Mark Gay, the
[4681.84 - 4683.84] P:1457.68 E:0.114767 |  Crystal Palace man,
[4683.84 - 4685.84] P:1606.46 E:0.111543 |  such a foot to Foden, Foden on the turn,
[4685.84 - 4687.84] P:1491.25 E:0.097761 |  that's how England and Manchester
[4687.84 - 4689.84] P:1505.09 E:0.108091 |  said he liked to see him play,
[4689.84 - 4691.84] P:1352.42 E:0.095706 |  using Dalligham to his left, now it's Cain,
[4691.84 - 4693.84] P:1587.01 E:0.097728 |  Cain's challenge goes down,
[4693.84 - 4695.84] P:1461.44 E:0.086688 |  DeVry put in that challenge,
[4695.84 - 4697.84] P:1511.38 E:0.097802 |  but took the ball, and even though Cain was on the ground,
[4697.84 - 4699.84] P:1531.32 E:0.111701 |  DeVry said, yeah, play on,
[4699.84 - 4701.84] P:1408.36 E:0.113419 |  and DeVry played for it, towards
[4701.84 - 4703.84] P:1535.24 E:0.105299 |  Dumfries, but that will just bounce out of play
[4703.84 - 4705.84] P:1616.92 E:0.113222 |  for a throw-in to England on the
[4705.84 - 4707.84] P:1481.67 E:0.101224 |  half-way line, Matt.
[4707.84 - 4709.84] P:1611.26 E:0.112069 |  Dumfries just having a complain there,
[4709.84 - 4711.84] P:1576.70 E:0.097209 |  Luke Shaw just checked his run, it was a good
[4711.84 - 4713.84] P:1709.84 E:0.094358 |  ball over the top from the Bruggen,
[4713.84 - 4715.84] P:1807.34 E:0.095688 |  actually, the Dutch winning the ball back,
[4715.84 - 4717.84] P:1790.69 E:0.095541 |  but they just can't seem to keep holding
[4717.84 - 4719.84] P:1836.84 E:0.097419 |  the ball at all, I mean, it's difficult for them,
[4719.84 - 4721.84] P:1864.51 E:0.098192 |  you just feel as time goes on in this
[4721.84 - 4723.84] P:1794.24 E:0.092943 |  game, you can't keep dropping deeper and
[4723.84 - 4725.84] P:1757.09 E:0.095146 |  deeper and defending how they are, I mean,
[4725.84 - 4727.84] P:1909.90 E:0.097397 |  they're packing out the midfield, very much
[4727.84 - 4729.84] P:1683.52 E:0.101082 |  three, sat in their veg horse up on his
[4729.84 - 4731.84] P:1735.93 E:0.077896 |  own, and they haven't got too much of
[4731.84 - 4733.84] P:1532.84 E:0.102018 |  an outlet, so England win the ball back,
[4733.84 - 4735.84] P:1615.88 E:0.097538 |  and then just building another wave of attacks
[4735.84 - 4737.84] P:1516.03 E:0.085518 |  to have to defend, it's very much the
[4737.84 - 4739.84] P:1417.28 E:0.105005 |  pattern in this second half so far.
[4739.84 - 4741.84] P:1651.72 E:0.084841 |  Yeah, the Dutch are sitting in here,
[4741.84 - 4743.84] P:1369.23 E:0.090418 |  a couple of my
[4743.84 - 4745.84] P:1519.33 E:0.102004 |  broadcasting friends who follow the Netherlands
[4745.84 - 4747.84] P:1473.17 E:0.099461 |  I saw them first, and I've seen the
[4747.84 - 4749.84] P:1476.85 E:0.101574 |  Netherlands live at this tournament, so first
[4749.84 - 4751.84] P:1272.03 E:0.098458 |  time I've seen them, asked them what they were thinking
[4751.84 - 4753.84] P:1538.42 E:0.100694 |  about the team, and they said,
[4753.84 - 4755.84] P:1697.45 E:0.114869 |  Kuman, he's such a conservative
[4755.84 - 4757.84] P:1532.29 E:0.091815 |  coach, rolling their eyes,
[4757.84 - 4759.84] P:1477.40 E:0.090625 |  so I think that give you an idea of the sort
[4759.84 - 4761.84] P:1581.54 E:0.097790 |  of reaction that there's been to the Dutch
[4761.84 - 4763.84] P:1443.98 E:0.101624 |  performance during the course of this tournament.
[4763.84 - 4765.84] P:1423.46 E:0.114934 |  Well, it's... Seen the rig of Bell somewhere?
[4765.84 - 4767.84] P:1586.45 E:0.096804 |  Yeah, he said everything when he brought
[4767.84 - 4769.84] P:1671.85 E:0.108413 |  Vierman on for the Pied, and how he looked at it,
[4769.84 - 4771.84] P:1678.86 E:0.113863 |  he thought it was an opportunity to shore things
[4771.84 - 4773.84] P:1558.94 E:0.108059 |  up as opposed to be more offensive,
[4773.84 - 4775.84] P:1703.66 E:0.105153 |  but it might be the smart move, because England,
[4775.84 - 4777.84] P:1845.06 E:0.107752 |  for me, are better. Here they are though, the Dutch
[4777.84 - 4779.84] P:1616.43 E:0.088723 |  trying to break with Gakpo,
[4779.84 - 4781.84] P:1712.02 E:0.096243 |  Gakpo, that's such a good tournament,
[4781.84 - 4783.84] P:1691.97 E:0.104250 |  then plays it to Dung Fries on the right
[4783.84 - 4785.84] P:1694.05 E:0.100951 |  hand side, Gakpo into the penalty area,
[4785.84 - 4787.84] P:1677.74 E:0.098139 |  the Dutch do have shirts in there, in from
[4787.84 - 4789.84] P:1643.11 E:0.102160 |  the left hand side, but he's got far too much on that.
[4789.84 - 4791.84] P:1671.28 E:0.108373 |  And the England fans cheer as it just
[4791.84 - 4793.84] P:1612.87 E:0.103148 |  drifts away beyond the far post, gulking.
[4793.84 - 4795.84] P:1629.55 E:0.101064 |  That's the threat they carry, both with
[4795.84 - 4797.84] P:1514.30 E:0.111065 |  Gakpo and with Seaman's either side
[4797.84 - 4799.84] P:1478.89 E:0.105745 |  of Veghoast, the both of those
[4799.84 - 4801.84] P:1770.90 E:0.098108 |  two either side that have got pace,
[4801.84 - 4803.84] P:1598.33 E:0.105737 |  and then they hope to get into danger areas
[4803.84 - 4805.84] P:1523.33 E:0.101127 |  and then put it into the box for the big man
[4805.84 - 4807.84] P:1421.86 E:0.092621 |  in Veghoast.
[4807.84 - 4809.84] P:1647.19 E:0.113513 |  We're all ready into the last half hour
[4809.84 - 4811.84] P:1478.71 E:0.092591 |  of this semi-final.
[4811.84 - 4813.84] P:1331.81 E:0.116529 |  So, just as I say that,
[4813.84 - 4815.84] P:1440.65 E:0.101510 |  thoughts begin to turn to
[4815.84 - 4817.84] P:1520.83 E:0.104289 |  what they might be after 90 minutes.
[4817.84 - 4819.84] P:1594.36 E:0.099386 |  Here's Foden, Foden
[4819.84 - 4821.84] P:1680.99 E:0.105182 |  inside his own half
[4821.84 - 4823.84] P:1501.04 E:0.087790 |  with Viermans sticking
[4823.84 - 4825.84] P:1372.78 E:0.096299 |  closely to him. Foden there just turns
[4825.84 - 4827.84] P:1373.70 E:0.112431 |  and there's a little bit of a reaction
[4827.84 - 4829.84] P:1393.34 E:0.095525 |  from him, bit of arms
[4829.84 - 4831.84] P:1569.41 E:0.089700 |  flailing from Foden, as if to say
[4831.84 - 4833.84] P:1397.25 E:0.104171 |  didn't have the options that I wanted there.
[4833.84 - 4835.84] P:1368.20 E:0.091541 |  Walker, now Rice makes himself available
[4835.84 - 4837.84] P:1510.97 E:0.098990 |  on the half way line.
[4837.84 - 4839.84] P:1319.93 E:0.096678 |  Rice just moving it from right
[4839.84 - 4841.84] P:1320.48 E:0.106496 |  to left, and then still coming
[4841.84 - 4843.84] P:1469.11 E:0.088387 |  forward.
[4843.84 - 4845.84] P:1532.06 E:0.101685 |  And now here is Mark Gay who's joined
[4845.84 - 4847.84] P:1396.09 E:0.116861 |  the attack from the left-hand side.
[4847.84 - 4849.84] P:1212.87 E:0.104683 |  Foden is available
[4849.84 - 4851.84] P:1263.75 E:0.098488 |  but the Dutch have got everyone
[4851.84 - 4853.84] P:1322.10 E:0.109617 |  apart from Veghoast behind the ball.
[4853.84 - 4855.84] P:1279.90 E:0.108166 |  England are going to have to find a way
[4855.84 - 4857.84] P:1328.00 E:0.107164 |  to take away through this.
[4857.84 - 4859.84] P:1401.87 E:0.104330 |  Bellingham, two Foden, now Shaw
[4859.84 - 4861.84] P:1351.05 E:0.108179 |  back towards Rice again
[4861.84 - 4863.84] P:1403.64 E:0.104158 |  who looks over his shoulder.
[4863.84 - 4865.84] P:1244.47 E:0.111521 |  Rice, now down the left-hand side.
[4865.84 - 4867.84] P:1425.75 E:0.100523 |  Luke Shaw with Seaman's
[4867.84 - 4869.84] P:1362.89 E:0.109882 |  very close quarters to Declan
[4869.84 - 4871.84] P:1444.47 E:0.113355 |  Rice. Foden is there as well
[4871.84 - 4873.84] P:1636.62 E:0.110688 |  in comes the challenge from Shouten
[4873.84 - 4875.84] P:1584.24 E:0.111868 |  but Rice was very quickly in
[4875.84 - 4877.84] P:1706.08 E:0.118004 |  and the referee says that
[4877.84 - 4879.84] P:1791.47 E:0.106859 |  Foden impeded Shouten and it's a pretty good
[4879.84 - 4881.84] P:1624.08 E:0.104424 |  kick to the Dutch half way inside the
[4881.84 - 4883.84] P:1727.96 E:0.099237 |  one half. We're yet to see an attempt
[4883.84 - 4885.84] P:1297.56 E:0.098785 |  on goal, Alan, from either side in the second
[4885.84 - 4887.84] P:1628.50 E:0.115651 |  goal. Yeah, I think England were
[4887.84 - 4889.84] P:1573.78 E:0.102257 |  knocking it around in Shaw and Foden
[4889.84 - 4891.84] P:1408.96 E:0.112065 |  and Declan Rice here down on England's
[4891.84 - 4893.84] P:1591.09 E:0.119218 |  left-hand side but they're actually
[4893.84 - 4895.84] P:1515.99 E:0.104944 |  going nowhere and the Dutch were
[4895.84 - 4897.84] P:1602.91 E:0.123046 |  quite happy to let them press and then
[4897.84 - 4899.84] P:1476.63 E:0.109024 |  on the goal they get the ball back
[4899.84 - 4901.84] P:1424.53 E:0.103737 |  and see Harry Kane just
[4901.84 - 4903.84] P:1413.35 E:0.105808 |  chatting away to
[4903.84 - 4905.84] P:1283.54 E:0.099598 |  the German referee
[4905.84 - 4907.84] P:1452.01 E:0.105119 |  Felix Speyer after that
[4907.84 - 4909.84] P:1401.45 E:0.099291 |  Bellingham might have been caught
[4909.84 - 4911.84] P:1619.85 E:0.105071 |  by a hand by Shouten
[4911.84 - 4913.84] P:1582.93 E:0.110635 |  but Shouten was able to play it back
[4913.84 - 4915.84] P:1465.64 E:0.098716 |  to the Brogdon and now here's
[4915.84 - 4917.84] P:1379.85 E:0.092209 |  Beeman and Seaman's
[4917.84 - 4919.84] P:1277.02 E:0.108546 |  and then Seaman's will knock it back into
[4919.84 - 4921.84] P:1385.98 E:0.103559 |  central defence
[4921.84 - 4923.84] P:1374.44 E:0.089094 |  to Van Dijk
[4923.84 - 4925.84] P:1337.04 E:0.113668 |  I mean they're cancelling each other out
[4925.84 - 4927.84] P:1390.01 E:0.095184 |  for the moment in the second half
[4927.84 - 4929.84] P:1535.87 E:0.103850 |  Shouten back to
[4929.84 - 4931.84] P:1518.98 E:0.085529 |  Deverey
[4931.84 - 4933.84] P:1572.55 E:0.108966 |  Nothing like the thrills and spills and
[4933.84 - 4935.84] P:1541.07 E:0.101289 |  creativity that was still in the first half
[4935.84 - 4937.84] P:1640.27 E:0.106681 |  but here it goes, Shouten with a pass
[4937.84 - 4939.84] P:1368.12 E:0.102629 |  down the right-hand side for Seaman
[4939.84 - 4941.84] P:1486.86 E:0.112286 |  but Pickford will pass it out
[4941.84 - 4943.84] P:1429.83 E:0.114987 |  so Declan Rice has come back almost into
[4943.84 - 4945.84] P:1411.16 E:0.111551 |  the left-back position
[4945.84 - 4947.84] P:1419.94 E:0.111931 |  Declan Rice
[4947.84 - 4949.84] P:1584.77 E:0.121656 |  back to Gey, he just chips it
[4949.84 - 4951.84] P:1795.64 E:0.102338 |  forward out of play and forced error
[4951.84 - 4953.84] P:1753.80 E:0.095025 |  and the Dutch supporters
[4953.84 - 4955.84] P:1673.81 E:0.103501 |  have taken real positivity from that
[4955.84 - 4957.84] P:1712.04 E:0.105601 |  and actually getting it to their feet and cheering
[4957.84 - 4959.84] P:1459.80 E:0.095867 |  their team on
[4959.84 - 4961.84] P:1254.81 E:0.096099 |  so Van Basten's shirt down there as well
[4961.84 - 4963.84] P:1379.41 E:0.098323 |  Pullut and Van Basten who scored
[4963.84 - 4965.84] P:1497.23 E:0.093172 |  the two goals when
[4965.84 - 4967.84] P:1549.12 E:0.119431 |  the Dutch won the Euros here in Germany
[4967.84 - 4969.84] P:1734.31 E:0.107475 |  back in 1988
[4969.84 - 4971.84] P:1655.09 E:0.090594 |  Gey in with a challenge from
[4971.84 - 4973.84] P:1558.55 E:0.103193 |  behind on Seaman's who
[4973.84 - 4975.84] P:1534.26 E:0.100068 |  goes down and wins the set piece on the right
[4975.84 - 4977.84] P:1685.84 E:0.109257 |  It's just two minutes of sloppy play
[4977.84 - 4979.84] P:1531.57 E:0.108381 |  we set up here on the left-hand side when they're in
[4979.84 - 4981.84] P:1642.79 E:0.104183 |  forward positions, now we've seen it in the defensive
[4981.84 - 4983.84] P:1663.18 E:0.104775 |  area where the ball can go quicker and earlier
[4983.84 - 4985.84] P:1594.00 E:0.097825 |  they get caught on the ball
[4985.84 - 4987.84] P:1700.36 E:0.104278 |  they give it out for a throw and it then comes back in
[4987.84 - 4989.84] P:1532.37 E:0.115999 |  and they give a foul away, it's unnecessary
[4989.84 - 4991.84] P:1454.63 E:0.102083 |  in a dangerous position
[4991.84 - 4993.84] P:1625.42 E:0.113390 |  It feels like it's a dangerous period of play this
[4993.84 - 4995.84] P:1413.64 E:0.101743 |  for England because the momentum
[4995.84 - 4997.84] P:1432.19 E:0.105009 |  they had in the first half has not been
[4997.84 - 4999.84] P:1507.49 E:0.104346 |  carried on into the second
[4999.84 - 5001.84] P:1615.78 E:0.106921 |  and the Dutch now with this set piece
[5001.84 - 5003.84] P:1498.80 E:0.112606 |  that
[5003.84 - 5005.84] P:1559.13 E:0.081954 |  Vierman is going to take
[5007.84 - 5009.84] P:1675.37 E:0.089404 |  from the right-hand side
[5009.84 - 5011.84] P:1405.53 E:0.105324 |  just
[5011.84 - 5013.84] P:1555.44 E:0.109722 |  the bottom of his boots is stood
[5013.84 - 5015.84] P:1674.21 E:0.098747 |  raises his right arm
[5015.84 - 5017.84] P:1502.62 E:0.102293 |  England holding their line
[5017.84 - 5019.84] P:1585.82 E:0.105219 |  just outside of the penalty area
[5019.84 - 5021.84] P:1345.47 E:0.114054 |  referee's in there talking to
[5021.84 - 5023.84] P:1203.15 E:0.095744 |  one of the Dutch players on the
[5023.84 - 5025.84] P:1463.49 E:0.111198 |  edge of the box, it's Van Dijk actually
[5025.84 - 5027.84] P:1337.41 E:0.092848 |  Van Dijk
[5027.84 - 5029.84] P:1468.60 E:0.090215 |  who's standing next to Kyle Walker
[5029.84 - 5031.84] P:1518.25 E:0.109386 |  who I think might be talking away to the Liverpool captain there
[5031.84 - 5033.84] P:1494.64 E:0.087786 |  Kyle Walker
[5033.84 - 5035.84] P:1623.77 E:0.090885 |  Vierman plays this in
[5035.84 - 5037.84] P:1681.58 E:0.114334 |  that's a lovely looking ball and it's
[5037.84 - 5039.84] P:1790.72 E:0.096210 |  Stab Goldich and saved by Pittford
[5039.84 - 5041.84] P:1609.33 E:0.085832 |  what a good save that was
[5041.84 - 5043.84] P:1626.02 E:0.095033 |  have to confess that
[5043.84 - 5045.84] P:1612.93 E:0.099572 |  looked like from Nathan Ackie that it was
[5045.84 - 5047.84] P:1640.77 E:0.097036 |  Goldbound and Pittford leaping to his left
[5047.84 - 5049.84] P:1707.37 E:0.096047 |  pushed it away wide
[5049.84 - 5051.84] P:1633.19 E:0.087158 |  come off death and right you know what I do know
[5051.84 - 5053.84] P:1677.87 E:0.110046 |  is it was a wonderful ball in
[5053.84 - 5055.84] P:1386.29 E:0.086078 |  real hard ball for the defenders
[5055.84 - 5057.84] P:1742.19 E:0.104881 |  and the goalkeeper to
[5057.84 - 5059.84] P:1579.85 E:0.095489 |  handle, but Pittford did really well
[5059.84 - 5061.84] P:1706.01 E:0.111505 |  and pushing it out for the corner
[5061.84 - 5063.84] P:1729.03 E:0.099798 |  Vierman to take this from the right-hand side
[5063.84 - 5065.84] P:1652.71 E:0.102239 |  first big chance at the second half
[5065.84 - 5067.84] P:1657.80 E:0.109590 |  still won the score
[5067.84 - 5069.84] P:1700.89 E:0.100052 |  after that excellent delivery with the free-kick
[5069.84 - 5071.84] P:1738.36 E:0.103738 |  and it comes in a tennered up and over by Dumfries
[5071.84 - 5073.84] P:1828.60 E:0.086332 |  at the near post and it's a goal kick to England
[5073.84 - 5075.84] P:1920.22 E:0.095591 |  you just can't afford to give them
[5075.84 - 5077.84] P:1944.34 E:0.096936 |  any chances you can't afford to try
[5077.84 - 5079.84] P:1745.19 E:0.087435 |  and let them get back into the game
[5079.84 - 5081.84] P:1769.55 E:0.090733 |  and England have done that themselves by
[5081.84 - 5083.84] P:1945.30 E:0.110984 |  giving silly fouls away and silly balls out
[5083.84 - 5085.84] P:1771.44 E:0.085965 |  for Throyens and just giving the encouragement
[5085.84 - 5087.84] P:1588.32 E:0.081233 |  that they may need
[5087.84 - 5089.84] P:1392.51 E:0.095718 |  down to Izzy who's behind that goal
[5089.84 - 5091.84] P:1537.75 E:0.094626 |  yeah the England fans are like
[5091.84 - 5093.84] P:1592.05 E:0.093832 |  called springs actually because
[5093.84 - 5095.84] P:1626.20 E:0.107606 |  they're just waiting for the next moment from England
[5095.84 - 5097.84] P:1531.50 E:0.096785 |  but I blame Ronald Koeman for that
[5097.84 - 5099.84] P:1507.91 E:0.107725 |  because he's been pretty negative hasn't he
[5099.84 - 5101.84] P:1465.72 E:0.102885 |  the way he set the team up in the second half
[5101.84 - 5103.84] P:1561.53 E:0.107876 |  it's kind of just nullified England
[5103.84 - 5105.84] P:1477.23 E:0.097112 |  but we've got to keep believing and
[5105.84 - 5107.84] P:1386.73 E:0.101293 |  staying in it because the fans are firmly behind them
[5107.84 - 5109.84] P:1484.06 E:0.092928 |  that's for sure
[5109.84 - 5111.84] P:1483.80 E:0.099361 |  I suppose headed back to Vogue Brogan on the edge of his penalty area
[5111.84 - 5113.84] P:1569.10 E:0.096241 |  and the Dutch goalkeeper is able to get it away
[5113.84 - 5115.84] P:1745.02 E:0.120095 |  first time downfield and
[5115.84 - 5117.84] P:1890.19 E:0.111665 |  Veg Horst is
[5117.84 - 5119.84] P:2022.95 E:0.115677 |  penalised for his
[5119.84 - 5121.84] P:2044.02 E:0.122483 |  physical challenge on John Stones who goes down
[5121.84 - 5123.84] P:2076.78 E:0.111268 |  Ronald Koeman can't believe it
[5123.84 - 5125.84] P:2037.82 E:0.109263 |  but it's a free kick to England
[5125.84 - 5127.84] P:2021.56 E:0.110525 |  I'm still not sure who that actually came off
[5127.84 - 5129.84] P:1874.25 E:0.091836 |  from the save from Pickford
[5129.84 - 5131.84] P:1713.26 E:0.087920 |  might have been Van Dyke, might have been Rice
[5131.84 - 5133.84] P:1776.33 E:0.085754 |  the two of them together
[5133.84 - 5135.84] P:1744.78 E:0.092506 |  but anyway free kick to England
[5135.84 - 5137.84] P:1858.80 E:0.108771 |  free kick to England and all this is a long ball up
[5137.84 - 5139.84] P:1721.01 E:0.091936 |  the goalkeeper Brogan had to get rid of it
[5139.84 - 5141.84] P:1719.54 E:0.118173 |  but in doing so it's a long ball up
[5141.84 - 5143.84] P:1696.32 E:0.092389 |  and he's trying to fight for it Veg Horst
[5143.84 - 5145.84] P:1758.48 E:0.109142 |  and Stones and at this level international football
[5145.84 - 5147.84] P:1537.23 E:0.104818 |  you're not going to get away with that
[5147.84 - 5149.84] P:1694.30 E:0.113528 |  when you're trying to, your arms are that high
[5149.84 - 5151.84] P:1312.52 E:0.092103 |  Alan England have not been able to get
[5151.84 - 5153.84] P:1435.34 E:0.111371 |  Saka into the game at all in the second half
[5153.84 - 5155.84] P:1565.68 E:0.104557 |  No, they've had a lot of possession
[5155.84 - 5157.84] P:1696.23 E:0.112172 |  but they've done very very little with it
[5157.84 - 5159.84] P:1752.55 E:0.107880 |  hardly ever been in the 18-yard box
[5159.84 - 5161.84] P:1522.45 E:0.100543 |  that caused a threat
[5161.84 - 5163.84] P:1559.38 E:0.099335 |  Here's Rice though, receives it from that free kick
[5163.84 - 5165.84] P:1463.74 E:0.102206 |  takes the ball through the middle, he has Bellingham
[5165.84 - 5167.84] P:1475.34 E:0.104749 |  now squared from him to Kobe Manu
[5167.84 - 5169.84] P:1206.18 E:0.101098 |  Manu, out to the right, Saka
[5169.84 - 5171.84] P:1368.81 E:0.105141 |  just backs away, I think the floodlights were in his eyes there for a moment
[5171.84 - 5173.84] P:1288.75 E:0.091259 |  Saka however
[5173.84 - 5175.84] P:1399.43 E:0.094240 |  was able to control it, Walker
[5175.84 - 5177.84] P:1408.28 E:0.099954 |  back to Manu, puts his foot on the ball
[5177.84 - 5179.84] P:1398.52 E:0.097128 |  Saka in field, Jordan tried to bring that down
[5179.84 - 5181.84] P:1549.02 E:0.091580 |  got away from him, cleared by De Vrij
[5181.84 - 5183.84] P:1764.64 E:0.099762 |  to Veg Horst, Veg Horst all action
[5183.84 - 5185.84] P:1728.06 E:0.099689 |  Stones is in on the challenge, gets the ball
[5185.84 - 5187.84] P:1655.38 E:0.110248 |  takes it away from him however
[5187.84 - 5189.84] P:1738.21 E:0.114085 |  that was straight back to the Dutch
[5189.84 - 5191.84] P:1578.00 E:0.088541 |  and to Shelton
[5191.84 - 5193.84] P:1464.04 E:0.096315 |  who was able to play to the left-hand side
[5193.84 - 5195.84] P:1289.61 E:0.097150 |  but the Dutch just actually almost pulled the handbrake
[5195.84 - 5197.84] P:1538.04 E:0.106582 |  on there instead of continuing to go forward
[5197.84 - 5199.84] P:1413.86 E:0.093491 |  back they go to the half-way line
[5199.84 - 5201.84] P:1483.76 E:0.097969 |  again, a pattern is emerging
[5201.84 - 5203.84] P:1473.12 E:0.091265 |  Here's Simon
[5203.84 - 5205.84] P:1449.13 E:0.106041 |  with Reinders
[5205.84 - 5207.84] P:1381.52 E:0.091791 |  just next to him but
[5207.84 - 5209.84] P:1310.02 E:0.100192 |  he's got a little bit of a backhand
[5209.84 - 5211.84] P:1372.63 E:0.110419 |  Dijk just gets the ball under control
[5211.84 - 5213.84] P:1538.46 E:0.109222 |  on the half-way line and taps it
[5213.84 - 5215.84] P:1559.00 E:0.112260 |  forward towards Reinders
[5215.84 - 5217.84] P:1527.71 E:0.101429 |  Reinders with a little shimmy
[5217.84 - 5219.84] P:1427.25 E:0.096358 |  Harry Kane goes with him, now Dumfries
[5219.84 - 5221.84] P:1150.99 E:0.110349 |  on the right-hand side
[5221.84 - 5223.84] P:1404.72 E:0.105255 |  back to De Vrij
[5223.84 - 5225.84] P:1516.03 E:0.086561 |  and then the fair-head, Shelton
[5225.84 - 5227.84] P:1478.03 E:0.110279 |  again, Nathan Ackie has got some space
[5227.84 - 5229.84] P:1495.68 E:0.090536 |  over there on the left-hand side
[5229.84 - 5231.84] P:1589.32 E:0.090745 |  and now Cody Gatpole on the left wing
[5231.84 - 5233.84] P:1740.80 E:0.104637 |  right foot across deep to the back post
[5233.84 - 5235.84] P:1816.36 E:0.108485 |  Pickford comes, gets his gloves to it
[5235.84 - 5237.84] P:1726.11 E:0.116113 |  there were two Dutch players at the back post
[5237.84 - 5239.84] P:1714.37 E:0.098735 |  but Pickford's touch takes it behind for Kornan
[5239.84 - 5241.84] P:1870.56 E:0.101994 |  Just in the defensive situation
[5241.84 - 5243.84] P:1679.62 E:0.099506 |  England did go back to the back five
[5243.84 - 5245.84] P:1727.34 E:0.097781 |  there and no surprise at all
[5245.84 - 5247.84] P:1741.10 E:0.099014 |  at every opportunity now, the Dutch
[5247.84 - 5249.84] P:1651.62 E:0.103134 |  on the left-hand side or the right-hand side
[5249.84 - 5251.84] P:1683.05 E:0.088786 |  their main aim is to fire balls
[5251.84 - 5253.84] P:1628.34 E:0.082746 |  into the box for the big man
[5253.84 - 5255.84] P:1682.05 E:0.097993 |  Kornan then from the right-hand side
[5255.84 - 5257.84] P:1726.75 E:0.076821 |  yeah it was Van Dijk
[5257.84 - 5259.84] P:1708.83 E:0.097615 |  who got the contact that forced
[5259.84 - 5261.84] P:1672.53 E:0.098868 |  to save from Jordan Pickford
[5261.84 - 5263.84] P:1628.15 E:0.097061 |  two or three minutes ago
[5263.84 - 5265.84] P:1867.50 E:0.098716 |  so one-one the score
[5265.84 - 5267.84] P:1697.72 E:0.103673 |  this is right in the balance again
[5267.84 - 5269.84] P:1609.56 E:0.102868 |  and referee Sviere
[5269.84 - 5271.84] P:1622.23 E:0.095280 |  is again
[5271.84 - 5273.84] P:1573.12 E:0.112967 |  right in the thick of it
[5273.84 - 5275.84] P:1682.01 E:0.109257 |  group of players there
[5275.84 - 5277.84] P:1670.17 E:0.113756 |  and here comes the Kornan
[5277.84 - 5279.84] P:1760.45 E:0.106824 |  the Dutch raise the volume
[5279.84 - 5281.84] P:1687.27 E:0.097703 |  Fierman
[5281.84 - 5283.84] P:1549.99 E:0.105734 |  it's a deep one this time
[5283.84 - 5285.84] P:1614.57 E:0.098772 |  headed goal with Bayer Kepert
[5285.84 - 5287.84] P:1710.72 E:0.099268 |  the whistle had already gone
[5287.84 - 5289.84] P:1699.44 E:0.096314 |  the referee gave him fair warning
[5289.84 - 5291.84] P:1759.92 E:0.053849 |  and I think he's
[5291.84 - 5293.84] P:1688.20 E:0.089611 |  just saying to Pickford
[5293.84 - 5295.84] P:1528.93 E:0.085654 |  what's he saying to Pickford
[5295.84 - 5297.84] P:1522.26 E:0.113947 |  anyway it's a free kick to England
[5297.84 - 5299.84] P:1584.84 E:0.101536 |  it was Fair Corson and Rice that were wrestling
[5299.84 - 5301.84] P:1755.08 E:0.100948 |  at the far post, they had each other
[5301.84 - 5303.84] P:1663.19 E:0.110602 |  by the neck really and as soon as the ref
[5303.84 - 5305.84] P:1666.00 E:0.102120 |  saw that he'd give a free kick for England
[5305.84 - 5307.84] P:1446.64 E:0.097888 |  and rightly so
[5307.84 - 5309.84] P:1566.50 E:0.077271 |  he twisted his head off
[5309.84 - 5311.84] P:1695.53 E:0.106140 |  Fair Corson has certainly
[5311.84 - 5313.84] P:1529.30 E:0.083110 |  put himself about
[5313.84 - 5315.84] P:1614.46 E:0.099040 |  as a friendly embrace
[5315.84 - 5317.84] P:1632.02 E:0.086346 |  very nice very much 50-50
[5317.84 - 5319.84] P:1801.07 E:0.088364 |  but like Al mentioned
[5319.84 - 5321.84] P:1488.22 E:0.098038 |  I think the referee just looked at it and thought
[5321.84 - 5323.84] P:1568.84 E:0.086822 |  well he's had too
[5323.84 - 5325.84] P:1731.41 E:0.107455 |  high around Rice, Rice was hugging him as well
[5325.84 - 5327.84] P:1469.02 E:0.095904 |  and I think England have to do that
[5327.84 - 5329.84] P:1464.75 E:0.103077 |  on that set place, we've got to be clever
[5329.84 - 5331.84] P:1408.22 E:0.105780 |  I think it's a big problem
[5331.84 - 5333.84] P:1492.59 E:0.099538 |  in those corners and England have to defend them well
[5333.84 - 5335.84] P:1585.03 E:0.096119 |  and be physical, match up
[5335.84 - 5337.84] P:1577.56 E:0.108661 |  against some really good headers
[5337.84 - 5339.84] P:1775.82 E:0.106921 |  of the ball, De Vij, Van Dijk
[5339.84 - 5341.84] P:1775.54 E:0.101701 |  we've got Veghoff standing out, OK done
[5341.84 - 5343.84] P:1545.93 E:0.102192 |  there's some good
[5343.84 - 5345.84] P:1647.16 E:0.115489 |  head in power in that team
[5345.84 - 5347.84] P:1566.46 E:0.087707 |  that's a concern
[5347.84 - 5349.84] P:1398.62 E:0.099799 |  Stones with a long pass there for Belling
[5349.84 - 5351.84] P:1547.38 E:0.097598 |  Chase but it was shabbarded behind by
[5351.84 - 5353.84] P:1457.49 E:0.109387 |  Shouten just watching on the field
[5353.84 - 5355.84] P:1572.20 E:0.102640 |  now over there on the far side, Phil Foulden
[5355.84 - 5357.84] P:1418.97 E:0.101440 |  talking to Pekai Osaka
[5357.84 - 5359.84] P:1469.45 E:0.112885 |  if we're thinking another change
[5359.84 - 5361.84] P:1497.86 E:0.098989 |  by Gareth Southgate, what's the change
[5361.84 - 5363.84] P:1429.18 E:0.092135 |  that is going to swing this
[5363.84 - 5365.84] P:1570.27 E:0.105157 |  back England's way in terms of the domination
[5365.84 - 5367.84] P:1795.05 E:0.094543 |  well because what the Dutch have done
[5367.84 - 5369.84] P:1745.67 E:0.101233 |  they're sitting right back and they've got so many bodies
[5369.84 - 5371.84] P:1815.27 E:0.098908 |  back there, it's very difficult to get the space
[5371.84 - 5373.84] P:1522.63 E:0.098826 |  Shouten's giving it away but Rice's pass forward
[5373.84 - 5375.84] P:1615.19 E:0.099655 |  is harmless way beyond anyone
[5375.84 - 5377.84] P:1507.32 E:0.087767 |  and through to the goalkeeper
[5377.84 - 5379.84] P:1654.86 E:0.106930 |  I was just wondering whether the legs of
[5379.84 - 5381.84] P:1724.22 E:0.099459 |  Watkins would do, you know
[5381.84 - 5383.84] P:1717.64 E:0.097412 |  in terms of running behind, I mean Bellingham's done it once
[5383.84 - 5385.84] P:1811.60 E:0.092118 |  or twice, I know there's not a lot of space
[5385.84 - 5387.84] P:1498.35 E:0.068461 |  in there because they're sitting back
[5387.84 - 5389.84] P:1601.79 E:0.104509 |  but we haven't caused them
[5389.84 - 5391.84] P:1708.42 E:0.092821 |  anywhere near enough problems in this second half
[5391.84 - 5393.84] P:1620.25 E:0.089659 |  compared to what we did in the first half
[5393.84 - 5395.84] P:1555.92 E:0.084562 |  Matt, what do you think, subsoice?
[5395.84 - 5397.84] P:1644.34 E:0.083464 |  I would think Ivan Tony
[5397.84 - 5399.84] P:1664.97 E:0.086027 |  and play two up and you'd have to
[5399.84 - 5401.84] P:1560.06 E:0.097579 |  take somebody out in the middle whether it be Foulden
[5401.84 - 5403.84] P:1705.03 E:0.090156 |  Bellingham or Maynou
[5403.84 - 5405.84] P:1636.98 E:0.096573 |  very difficult to pick who you'd take off
[5405.84 - 5407.84] P:1637.95 E:0.095741 |  but I think Ivan Tony
[5407.84 - 5409.84] P:1679.95 E:0.090034 |  or Watkins like Alimentian but Tony for me
[5409.84 - 5411.84] P:1601.31 E:0.102410 |  I think he's a real threat. It's 1-1
[5411.84 - 5413.84] P:1709.61 E:0.089210 |  BBC Radio 5 Live, semi-final night
[5413.84 - 5415.84] P:1542.90 E:0.090157 |  here in Dortmund for the right to meet Spain
[5415.84 - 5417.84] P:1571.88 E:0.098788 |  in Berlin on Sunday, we'll have that
[5417.84 - 5419.84] P:1712.27 E:0.094928 |  fully covered for you across the BBC
[5419.84 - 5421.84] P:1554.03 E:0.107974 |  it's live on BBC television and of course
[5421.84 - 5423.84] P:1546.04 E:0.107565 |  here on 5 Live, here is
[5423.84 - 5425.84] P:1520.57 E:0.097716 |  Reinders
[5425.84 - 5427.84] P:1441.55 E:0.101494 |  Reinders back to
[5427.84 - 5429.84] P:1542.06 E:0.109817 |  Siemens, now it's England who are parked
[5429.84 - 5431.84] P:1362.46 E:0.099155 |  inside their own heart
[5431.84 - 5433.84] P:1548.67 E:0.094392 |  Siemens
[5433.84 - 5435.84] P:1434.03 E:0.110576 |  to Ake
[5435.84 - 5437.84] P:1549.54 E:0.117418 |  Virgil van Dijk just turns to his right
[5437.84 - 5439.84] P:1538.01 E:0.099256 |  rolls the pass through the middle
[5439.84 - 5441.84] P:1595.41 E:0.110838 |  to Siemens, that's a little short
[5441.84 - 5443.84] P:1687.61 E:0.113733 |  to De Vrij and Bellingham in on the slide there
[5443.84 - 5445.84] P:1732.20 E:0.104290 |  that's naughty, in on De Vrij
[5445.84 - 5447.84] P:1818.61 E:0.102082 |  and a yellow card comes out for Jude Bellingham
[5447.84 - 5449.84] P:1738.21 E:0.105491 |  and I did wonder
[5449.84 - 5451.84] P:1908.44 E:0.089375 |  for a moment there
[5451.84 - 5453.84] P:1883.41 E:0.088115 |  whether the referee
[5453.84 - 5455.84] P:1879.85 E:0.100659 |  you know, he needs to be really careful
[5455.84 - 5457.84] P:1845.14 E:0.105525 |  because I saw him a minute ago look over to the bench
[5457.84 - 5459.84] P:1813.33 E:0.090025 |  at Gareth and sort of throw his arms
[5459.84 - 5461.84] P:1714.94 E:0.093087 |  in the air, as if to say this is not working
[5461.84 - 5463.84] P:1468.55 E:0.066805 |  Do you not think that
[5463.84 - 5465.84] P:1610.86 E:0.096489 |  when we go to that for
[5465.84 - 5467.84] P:1602.66 E:0.097761 |  one of them has to play this, it's the old
[5467.84 - 5469.84] P:1655.45 E:0.093800 |  issue isn't it, one having to play out on the left
[5469.84 - 5471.84] P:1679.50 E:0.096982 |  Bellingham's been out in here second half
[5471.84 - 5473.84] P:1732.23 E:0.102791 |  He's not comfortable doing it isn't he?
[5473.84 - 5475.84] P:1567.68 E:0.101405 |  And he doesn't look like, you know, it's not where
[5475.84 - 5477.84] P:1659.89 E:0.097010 |  he's at his best and he knows it and he kind of
[5477.84 - 5479.84] P:1611.10 E:0.069202 |  expresses that to be honest
[5479.84 - 5481.84] P:1686.48 E:0.089256 |  So the referee that Jude Bellingham once
[5481.84 - 5483.84] P:1630.45 E:0.085435 |  called out two or three years ago
[5483.84 - 5485.84] P:1589.13 E:0.098704 |  shows him a yellow card here
[5485.84 - 5487.84] P:1553.94 E:0.083126 |  But really, it was a simple decision
[5487.84 - 5489.84] P:1569.95 E:0.095532 |  right decision
[5489.84 - 5491.84] P:1836.95 E:0.110431 |  I think if he's going to do that then he's also got the option
[5491.84 - 5493.84] P:1708.08 E:0.101234 |  of Eze and Gordon as well as he on the left
[5493.84 - 5495.84] P:1483.98 E:0.093357 |  hand side
[5495.84 - 5497.84] P:1549.06 E:0.107180 |  Here is Manu, Manu has challenged
[5497.84 - 5499.84] P:1656.90 E:0.109856 |  illegally so
[5499.84 - 5501.84] P:1810.58 E:0.112227 |  by Gakpo so it's a free kick, Manu very quickly
[5501.84 - 5503.84] P:1865.97 E:0.091824 |  up to his feet there
[5503.84 - 5505.84] P:1586.29 E:0.089812 |  he wasn't staying down
[5505.84 - 5507.84] P:1710.47 E:0.092001 |  and England leave it
[5507.84 - 5509.84] P:1569.28 E:0.079127 |  for the free kick to be taken
[5509.84 - 5511.84] P:1476.39 E:0.094970 |  Yeah, not the
[5511.84 - 5513.84] P:1560.19 E:0.103148 |  dazzling play as it was at times
[5513.84 - 5515.84] P:1635.58 E:0.087690 |  in the first half from England
[5515.84 - 5517.84] P:1477.86 E:0.093430 |  and therefore it's 1-1
[5517.84 - 5519.84] P:1527.75 E:0.104855 |  and with the play that it is at the moment
[5519.84 - 5521.84] P:1347.40 E:0.094825 |  the pattern that it is, it would not be
[5521.84 - 5523.84] P:1514.82 E:0.095333 |  in the least surprising
[5523.84 - 5525.84] P:1515.70 E:0.099700 |  where this match to go into extra time
[5525.84 - 5527.84] P:1383.09 E:0.096514 |  Manu
[5527.84 - 5529.84] P:1574.29 E:0.103037 |  moving from right to left
[5529.84 - 5531.84] P:1678.40 E:0.109612 |  all the way the pass comes to
[5531.84 - 5533.84] P:1683.37 E:0.103720 |  Luke Shaw, Bellingham makes the run
[5533.84 - 5535.84] P:1577.21 E:0.092249 |  but Shaw goes back towards
[5535.84 - 5537.84] P:1717.56 E:0.095868 |  Rice
[5537.84 - 5539.84] P:1892.27 E:0.096865 |  and there were Mark Gay, Stones
[5539.84 - 5541.84] P:1912.13 E:0.127223 |  Fordham wants it over there on the right
[5541.84 - 5543.84] P:1974.34 E:0.122888 |  hand side, Fordham putting his arms
[5543.84 - 5545.84] P:2001.88 E:0.112045 |  apart on the right flank
[5545.84 - 5547.84] P:2004.33 E:0.116319 |  he wanted that more quickly
[5547.84 - 5549.84] P:1992.97 E:0.119066 |  you can see there his arm goes up again, Fordham
[5549.84 - 5551.84] P:2025.73 E:0.103568 |  Are you a bit
[5551.84 - 5553.84] P:1988.17 E:0.100071 |  surprised the shape's changed
[5553.84 - 5555.84] P:1982.93 E:0.103840 |  from the first half because
[5555.84 - 5557.84] P:2016.84 E:0.090907 |  it's a straight swap for Trippie
[5557.84 - 5559.84] P:1912.54 E:0.102658 |  you think it'd just be more balanced
[5559.84 - 5561.84] P:1968.71 E:0.101058 |  and more aggressive going forwards, it's really surprised me
[5561.84 - 5563.84] P:1932.74 E:0.096065 |  that we have really gone back to our back four
[5563.84 - 5565.84] P:1716.16 E:0.113354 |  Here now, Saka takes on Ake
[5565.84 - 5567.84] P:1654.03 E:0.110442 |  but Ake is able to play
[5567.84 - 5569.84] P:1511.88 E:0.106800 |  that via
[5569.84 - 5571.84] P:1680.11 E:0.119629 |  the England man and it's through for a goal kick
[5571.84 - 5573.84] P:1796.37 E:0.113040 |  and Phil Fordham is not happy
[5573.84 - 5575.84] P:1749.82 E:0.113582 |  he says something to the referee as he walks past him
[5575.84 - 5577.84] P:1777.69 E:0.099497 |  with his hands on his hips
[5577.84 - 5579.84] P:1829.20 E:0.110861 |  Van Dyke says something to the referee
[5579.84 - 5581.84] P:1721.54 E:0.097302 |  Saka is still down, maybe he just got
[5581.84 - 5583.84] P:1650.53 E:0.100682 |  his toe in stood on by Ake
[5583.84 - 5585.84] P:1801.16 E:0.092569 |  but it's a goal kick to the Dutch
[5585.84 - 5587.84] P:1565.80 E:0.093485 |  When you compare in the first half to the
[5587.84 - 5589.84] P:1744.97 E:0.111417 |  second half what we said about all the positives
[5589.84 - 5591.84] P:1628.53 E:0.092280 |  about the quick passing, about the energy
[5591.84 - 5593.84] P:1783.18 E:0.108054 |  and all of those things that were so good
[5593.84 - 5595.84] P:1696.22 E:0.086996 |  we haven't hardly seen any of it
[5595.84 - 5597.84] P:1526.72 E:0.084685 |  in the second half up to now
[5597.84 - 5599.84] P:1589.64 E:0.085718 |  right, thick horse
[5599.84 - 5601.84] P:1885.34 E:0.115730 |  with Gage, might have pulled his shirt there
[5601.84 - 5603.84] P:1807.18 E:0.098204 |  however, Siemens
[5603.84 - 5605.84] P:1754.38 E:0.118462 |  then to Gackporn, then Kyle Walker in with the challenge
[5605.84 - 5607.84] P:1872.45 E:0.111912 |  I think it was the 50-50
[5607.84 - 5609.84] P:1964.63 E:0.099473 |  the Dutch are
[5609.84 - 5611.84] P:1911.82 E:0.110626 |  in the stands saying that they felt that was a foul
[5611.84 - 5613.84] P:1797.32 E:0.110043 |  but I think it was well timed by Walker
[5613.84 - 5615.84] P:1774.73 E:0.102523 |  Here's Bellingham, gets his head to it on the left hand side
[5615.84 - 5617.84] P:1753.14 E:0.109680 |  but can't keep the ball in play
[5617.84 - 5619.84] P:1682.90 E:0.113986 |  so that's a throw in to the Dutch
[5619.84 - 5621.84] P:1578.72 E:0.111937 |  Bellingham had to be careful there, he's on a yellow card
[5621.84 - 5623.84] P:1636.21 E:0.110768 |  and he passed the ball away
[5623.84 - 5625.84] P:1644.37 E:0.100748 |  he's just got to watch himself
[5625.84 - 5627.84] P:1653.24 E:0.099892 |  in these circumstances
[5627.84 - 5629.84] P:1359.14 E:0.091141 |  a red card
[5629.84 - 5631.84] P:1466.05 E:0.092236 |  I mean that could be pivotal
[5631.84 - 5633.84] P:1522.02 E:0.103063 |  in terms of the way that a match that is poised
[5633.84 - 5635.84] P:1558.62 E:0.088610 |  like this goes
[5635.84 - 5637.84] P:1694.65 E:0.091430 |  Gareth needs to be careful here
[5637.84 - 5639.84] P:1760.14 E:0.105922 |  because he's got a frustrated young football
[5639.84 - 5641.84] P:1697.33 E:0.106987 |  out there on the left who doesn't really want to be there
[5641.84 - 5643.84] P:1595.68 E:0.090258 |  he's just been yellow carded for a tackle
[5643.84 - 5645.84] P:1634.18 E:0.099727 |  he's moaning to the manager
[5645.84 - 5647.84] P:1767.68 E:0.109602 |  to see it's not working at the minute
[5647.84 - 5649.84] P:1617.85 E:0.102526 |  he needs to be careful and have a think about taking him off
[5649.84 - 5651.84] P:1562.90 E:0.083336 |  Now here's Gackporn
[5651.84 - 5653.84] P:1611.76 E:0.089485 |  as the Dutch come forward
[5653.84 - 5655.84] P:1491.24 E:0.089247 |  the game has changed in the second half
[5655.84 - 5657.84] P:1185.58 E:0.089733 |  Reinders
[5657.84 - 5659.84] P:1299.17 E:0.108111 |  Gackporn again running at Bukai Osaka
[5659.84 - 5661.84] P:1417.26 E:0.086672 |  it's back in position
[5661.84 - 5663.84] P:1399.86 E:0.102891 |  it's part of the defence for the time being
[5663.84 - 5665.84] P:1506.64 E:0.099336 |  Reinders, square from him
[5665.84 - 5667.84] P:1488.19 E:0.094015 |  to Schouten
[5667.84 - 5669.84] P:1376.76 E:0.105514 |  and then back to De Vrij
[5669.84 - 5671.84] P:1720.48 E:0.098816 |  with
[5671.84 - 5673.84] P:1877.47 E:0.098213 |  just over 15 minutes
[5673.84 - 5675.84] P:1648.32 E:0.068597 |  to play
[5675.84 - 5677.84] P:1706.58 E:0.084396 |  Dumfries
[5679.84 - 5681.84] P:1425.33 E:0.108256 |  Reinders again who's appeared on the right hand side
[5681.84 - 5683.84] P:1454.82 E:0.104204 |  they're a very industrious three
[5683.84 - 5685.84] P:1602.79 E:0.102037 |  this midfield that the Dutch now have on the field
[5685.84 - 5687.84] P:1458.00 E:0.101069 |  with German coming on in the first half
[5687.84 - 5689.84] P:1552.07 E:0.115800 |  the other one Schouten
[5689.84 - 5691.84] P:1479.58 E:0.110231 |  now to Dumfries
[5691.84 - 5693.84] P:1582.88 E:0.108229 |  Schouten again
[5693.84 - 5695.84] P:1526.04 E:0.108706 |  back into the central area
[5695.84 - 5697.84] P:1516.38 E:0.115663 |  now through the middle
[5697.84 - 5699.84] P:1573.63 E:0.100480 |  Reinders wants it, Siemens
[5699.84 - 5701.84] P:1502.70 E:0.095651 |  the Dutch
[5701.84 - 5703.84] P:1411.48 E:0.106543 |  knocking the ball about
[5703.84 - 5705.84] P:1272.39 E:0.110593 |  as is their traditional style
[5705.84 - 5707.84] P:1705.65 E:0.100899 |  Van Dijk now back to Schouten
[5707.84 - 5709.84] P:1513.48 E:0.114920 |  again Siemens finds a little space
[5709.84 - 5711.84] P:1576.46 E:0.111174 |  on the right hand side
[5711.84 - 5713.84] P:1641.21 E:0.110916 |  Siemens a little dart forward towards the edge
[5713.84 - 5715.84] P:1406.56 E:0.099671 |  of the penalty area from him
[5715.84 - 5717.84] P:1545.66 E:0.087427 |  and then Reinders
[5717.84 - 5719.84] P:1565.03 E:0.093264 |  back to
[5719.84 - 5721.84] P:1615.91 E:0.097909 |  the German
[5721.84 - 5723.84] P:1371.09 E:0.087090 |  and then Schouten
[5723.84 - 5725.84] P:1547.28 E:0.109359 |  with Siemens
[5725.84 - 5727.84] P:1569.06 E:0.108375 |  and still the Dutch just knocking it
[5727.84 - 5729.84] P:1412.11 E:0.104988 |  close passes 10 yards then back towards
[5729.84 - 5731.84] P:1542.53 E:0.095927 |  Van Dijk now out to the left hand side
[5731.84 - 5733.84] P:1554.49 E:0.110416 |  Nathan Ake
[5733.84 - 5735.84] P:1466.59 E:0.109087 |  Gackporn is there as well with his heels on the white line
[5735.84 - 5737.84] P:1541.54 E:0.104059 |  now he's running it
[5737.84 - 5739.84] P:1273.30 E:0.109655 |  Ake is trusted to the area
[5739.84 - 5741.84] P:1691.48 E:0.099695 |  that's headed away by Declan Rice
[5741.84 - 5743.84] P:1694.16 E:0.105976 |  Harry Kane racing for it
[5743.84 - 5745.84] P:1571.50 E:0.107758 |  but can't get there
[5745.84 - 5747.84] P:1589.90 E:0.111373 |  Schouten comfortably there first
[5747.84 - 5749.84] P:1542.48 E:0.112498 |  and the Dutch
[5749.84 - 5751.84] P:1522.65 E:0.118054 |  their spirits are rising here
[5751.84 - 5753.84] P:1413.69 E:0.105886 |  because they're dominating the possession
[5753.84 - 5755.84] P:1430.35 E:0.110364 |  right now in the match and England are on the back foot
[5755.84 - 5757.84] P:1556.21 E:0.110307 |  they've dropped 20 yards further back
[5757.84 - 5759.84] P:1510.78 E:0.106454 |  and they're the one that are soaking up the pressure now
[5759.84 - 5761.84] P:1607.18 E:0.102294 |  they're the ones that are sitting back now
[5761.84 - 5763.84] P:1295.21 E:0.091919 |  England
[5763.84 - 5765.84] P:1496.62 E:0.116709 |  so it is again the Dutch
[5765.84 - 5767.84] P:1380.70 E:0.102224 |  with Schouten
[5767.84 - 5769.84] P:1346.99 E:0.103697 |  De Vrij
[5769.84 - 5771.84] P:1512.89 E:0.089420 |  then is able to come forward
[5771.84 - 5773.84] P:1676.79 E:0.083892 |  and then just tap it square again
[5773.84 - 5775.84] P:1596.87 E:0.099395 |  Reinders
[5775.84 - 5777.84] P:1550.88 E:0.095173 |  turns
[5777.84 - 5779.84] P:1551.52 E:0.109230 |  but Cobby Maynou comes across
[5779.84 - 5781.84] P:1322.55 E:0.101230 |  in front of him
[5781.84 - 5783.84] P:1408.54 E:0.076048 |  Nathan Ake
[5783.84 - 5785.84] P:1462.95 E:0.098089 |  and it is
[5785.84 - 5787.84] P:1440.90 E:0.100312 |  Viamen again in quite a deep lying position
[5787.84 - 5789.84] P:1525.81 E:0.106183 |  chips it out towards the left hand side where
[5789.84 - 5791.84] P:1495.48 E:0.105810 |  Gackporn is up against Walker this time
[5791.84 - 5793.84] P:1633.40 E:0.106026 |  Gackporn's ball in right footed into the penalty area
[5793.84 - 5795.84] P:1628.34 E:0.113247 |  might bounce down for the shot from Seamon's
[5795.84 - 5797.84] P:1707.24 E:0.104579 |  into the ground
[5797.84 - 5799.84] P:1701.64 E:0.105283 |  and then it bounces up and Pikvid is able to hold it comfortably
[5799.84 - 5801.84] P:1749.66 E:0.110989 |  well it's good for Gackporn
[5801.84 - 5803.84] P:1705.61 E:0.103950 |  1v1
[5803.84 - 5805.84] P:1700.01 E:0.102098 |  Kyle Walker who decides to come back inside on his right
[5805.84 - 5807.84] P:1678.24 E:0.106224 |  and whip it in there for Begost again
[5807.84 - 5809.84] P:1436.65 E:0.089210 |  and it falls well for Seamon
[5809.84 - 5811.84] P:1777.98 E:0.102871 |  but he just can't get his volley away
[5811.84 - 5813.84] P:1818.47 E:0.104655 |  hits it into the ground which is straight up Pikvid
[5815.84 - 5817.84] P:1754.61 E:0.099282 |  so down pitch side behind that goal to Izzy
[5817.84 - 5819.84] P:1728.79 E:0.093520 |  yeah a really long bit of play with that
[5819.84 - 5821.84] P:1622.82 E:0.105417 |  England had to just withstand and soak up the pressure didn't they
[5821.84 - 5823.84] P:1588.73 E:0.108481 |  Dutch moving the ball really well side to side
[5823.84 - 5825.84] P:1506.03 E:0.110691 |  it was a comfortable save
[5825.84 - 5827.84] P:1790.29 E:0.116321 |  in the end for Pikvid but the Dutch you can see
[5827.84 - 5829.84] P:1765.66 E:0.112244 |  just growing in enthusiasm
[5829.84 - 5831.84] P:1773.49 E:0.106464 |  getting that shot off will bring them confidence without a doubt
[5835.84 - 5837.84] P:1587.51 E:0.099928 |  but how much match is it the way that England
[5837.84 - 5839.84] P:1469.40 E:0.095451 |  are playing that is helping the Dutch confidence
[5839.84 - 5841.84] P:1578.69 E:0.099561 |  yes it's just
[5841.84 - 5843.84] P:1374.61 E:0.101911 |  we've not had the rhythm
[5843.84 - 5845.84] P:1588.43 E:0.098615 |  and then because the Dutch are getting back into it
[5845.84 - 5847.84] P:1525.81 E:0.110935 |  Beghorst has been a brilliant focal point
[5847.84 - 5849.84] P:1622.01 E:0.110053 |  I have to say he's relieving pressure
[5849.84 - 5851.84] P:1527.60 E:0.110453 |  not only getting hold of the ball
[5851.84 - 5853.84] P:1562.86 E:0.101551 |  he's then laying his teammates in and the Dutch have managed to get up the pitch
[5853.84 - 5855.84] P:1533.42 E:0.091184 |  and ride the storm
[5855.84 - 5857.84] P:1610.29 E:0.098137 |  whenever that ball goes in the box they're just looking for
[5857.84 - 5859.84] P:1610.69 E:0.084294 |  crossing opportunities
[5859.84 - 5861.84] P:1566.49 E:0.102286 |  Gackpo one on one he'll shift it onto his right foot
[5861.84 - 5863.84] P:1608.40 E:0.101118 |  and he will whip that in every time knowing that Beghorst
[5863.84 - 5865.84] P:1451.39 E:0.092595 |  and Seamon's are just waiting in the box room
[5865.84 - 5867.84] P:1686.77 E:0.100725 |  the race gave it away but it bounces back for England
[5867.84 - 5869.84] P:1648.45 E:0.106462 |  Parma and Watkins are going to come on
[5869.84 - 5871.84] P:1744.82 E:0.090313 |  for England
[5871.84 - 5873.84] P:1607.68 E:0.080064 |  here's Shaw
[5873.84 - 5875.84] P:1763.04 E:0.100215 |  Shaw now left for the ball across the box
[5875.84 - 5877.84] P:1691.06 E:0.089806 |  headed away by Van Gaik
[5877.84 - 5879.84] P:1610.01 E:0.096843 |  that'll come out to Rice
[5879.84 - 5881.84] P:1488.40 E:0.090613 |  he just has a look to see where Gackpo is
[5881.84 - 5883.84] P:1568.57 E:0.100304 |  and draws him and then gives it to Walker
[5883.84 - 5885.84] P:1632.16 E:0.090482 |  Walker makes ground up the right hand side
[5885.84 - 5887.84] P:1440.64 E:0.073037 |  then back towards Rice
[5887.84 - 5889.84] P:1527.18 E:0.103056 |  yeah it's really had the feel
[5889.84 - 5891.84] P:1797.85 E:0.099764 |  that England needed freshening up
[5891.84 - 5893.84] P:1825.29 E:0.103755 |  they needed substitutes
[5893.84 - 5895.84] P:1971.82 E:0.114456 |  and it is Watkins as you suggested
[5895.84 - 5897.84] P:1996.43 E:0.112459 |  Alan is going to come on and Parma as well
[5897.84 - 5899.84] P:2039.29 E:0.111718 |  so we're going to see a double change
[5899.84 - 5901.84] P:2056.82 E:0.108509 |  the question is who's coming up
[5901.84 - 5903.84] P:1966.04 E:0.113668 |  Forden now, Forden towards the edge of the area
[5903.84 - 5905.84] P:1860.73 E:0.100508 |  now to Walker, Walker's ball in
[5905.84 - 5907.84] P:1950.78 E:0.106803 |  Bacchia Saka
[5907.84 - 5909.84] P:1792.81 E:0.115771 |  to one England offside
[5909.84 - 5911.84] P:1637.62 E:0.110030 |  flag goes up and the goal is ruled out
[5913.84 - 5915.84] P:1637.59 E:0.103867 |  agony for England
[5915.84 - 5917.84] P:1696.32 E:0.108195 |  for the third time at the tournament
[5917.84 - 5919.84] P:1562.90 E:0.096699 |  they've had the ball in the net
[5919.84 - 5921.84] P:1727.04 E:0.100293 |  and the goals ruled out for offside
[5921.84 - 5923.84] P:1570.25 E:0.097878 |  on the one occasion that they do threaten
[5923.84 - 5925.84] P:1535.76 E:0.089107 |  down the right hand side
[5925.84 - 5927.84] P:1618.93 E:0.110314 |  oh that is very very tight
[5927.84 - 5929.84] P:1599.50 E:0.100388 |  that is so tight with Kyle Walker there
[5929.84 - 5931.84] P:1618.81 E:0.105677 |  and he picks out Bacchia
[5931.84 - 5933.84] P:1692.30 E:0.099422 |  Saka in the middle there
[5933.84 - 5935.84] P:1758.03 E:0.105793 |  and he finishes it really really well
[5935.84 - 5937.84] P:1615.95 E:0.086288 |  it's a tight call that is
[5937.84 - 5939.84] P:1592.49 E:0.087342 |  let's just see if it is
[5939.84 - 5941.84] P:1508.73 E:0.102387 |  confirmed
[5941.84 - 5943.84] P:1467.32 E:0.093284 |  yeah confirmed
[5943.84 - 5945.84] P:1521.04 E:0.092040 |  offside the goal is ruled out
[5945.84 - 5947.84] P:1580.08 E:0.097684 |  it remains Netherlands one England one
[5947.84 - 5949.84] P:1543.46 E:0.095077 |  but there we are
[5949.84 - 5951.84] P:1532.84 E:0.097826 |  I mean that's what England have been crying out for
[5951.84 - 5953.84] P:1784.43 E:0.089247 |  for the second half
[5953.84 - 5955.84] P:1651.20 E:0.099605 |  and who's coming off
[5955.84 - 5957.84] P:1866.83 E:0.108570 |  it is going to be Harry Kane
[5957.84 - 5959.84] P:1841.25 E:0.097981 |  so that's it Harry Kane
[5959.84 - 5961.84] P:1845.81 E:0.108669 |  taken off in the 80th minute
[5961.84 - 5963.84] P:1863.90 E:0.099097 |  today
[5963.84 - 5965.84] P:1824.65 E:0.077695 |  and
[5965.84 - 5967.84] P:1808.80 E:0.088043 |  the other
[5967.84 - 5969.84] P:1751.49 E:0.094661 |  I'm not sure if the number has actually gone up
[5969.84 - 5971.84] P:1653.15 E:0.102816 |  so it is Ford
[5971.84 - 5973.84] P:1707.97 E:0.104422 |  and Ford comes off
[5973.84 - 5975.84] P:1673.06 E:0.102579 |  interesting to see what the body language is like here
[5975.84 - 5977.84] P:1695.41 E:0.106032 |  Garry Southgate does go across to him
[5977.84 - 5979.84] P:1796.01 E:0.093531 |  Cole Palmer comes on
[5979.84 - 5981.84] P:1782.05 E:0.095568 |  Garry Southgate has a clasp of hands
[5981.84 - 5983.84] P:1640.19 E:0.107081 |  he puts his arm around him there's a little word between them
[5983.84 - 5985.84] P:1654.84 E:0.088264 |  Harry Kane as well gets a
[5985.84 - 5987.84] P:1477.60 E:0.097670 |  a hug a pat on the back the man who scored the equaliser
[5987.84 - 5989.84] P:1558.42 E:0.084559 |  from the penalty spot
[5989.84 - 5991.84] P:1460.45 E:0.105098 |  so there we are Watkins and Palmer
[5991.84 - 5993.84] P:1641.89 E:0.101150 |  let's see what they can bring Alan
[5993.84 - 5995.84] P:1686.01 E:0.097858 |  yeah well he'll certainly bring fresh legs
[5995.84 - 5997.84] P:1589.73 E:0.096068 |  he'll certainly bring someone who's
[5997.84 - 5999.84] P:1659.15 E:0.103015 |  willing to run in behind
[5999.84 - 6001.84] P:1741.66 E:0.098281 |  which he haven't had that at all other than that one occasion
[6001.84 - 6003.84] P:1676.26 E:0.095879 |  where Walker was just offside
[6003.84 - 6005.84] P:1612.89 E:0.103946 |  and someone who'll chase down
[6005.84 - 6007.84] P:1637.17 E:0.093400 |  and put them under pressure at the back
[6007.84 - 6009.84] P:1615.99 E:0.104697 |  we haven't had that at all
[6009.84 - 6011.84] P:1629.59 E:0.098375 |  well that's what he's doing now
[6011.84 - 6013.84] P:1586.43 E:0.093505 |  Watkins herring around the Aston Villa Top Scorer
[6013.84 - 6015.84] P:1552.06 E:0.094667 |  Bellingham now slides in but De Vrij hit that long
[6015.84 - 6017.84] P:1733.52 E:0.095798 |  Beko's got up
[6017.84 - 6019.84] P:1697.86 E:0.092541 |  and out to the Seamons but
[6019.84 - 6021.84] P:1632.76 E:0.101915 |  Luke Shaw was in and now Mark Gay
[6021.84 - 6023.84] P:1480.25 E:0.093028 |  back to goalkeeper Pickford
[6023.84 - 6025.84] P:1513.14 E:0.108924 |  so Cole Palmer
[6025.84 - 6027.84] P:1561.44 E:0.103595 |  has taken up a position
[6027.84 - 6029.84] P:1749.31 E:0.099610 |  over there on the right side of the midfield
[6029.84 - 6031.84] P:1731.13 E:0.107593 |  on the right side of the midfield
[6031.84 - 6033.84] P:1714.27 E:0.110900 |  and Mark Gay just playing it forward
[6033.84 - 6035.84] P:1703.37 E:0.108623 |  towards Covey Manu
[6035.84 - 6037.84] P:1652.75 E:0.108576 |  they've got less than 10 minutes to go
[6037.84 - 6039.84] P:1550.13 E:0.115351 |  Interesting Bellingham still out on this left hand side
[6039.84 - 6041.84] P:1504.41 E:0.104463 |  isn't it
[6041.84 - 6043.84] P:1609.62 E:0.105160 |  I mean he's operated here but he doesn't look
[6043.84 - 6045.84] P:1429.80 E:0.098622 |  particularly like he's in the zone
[6045.84 - 6047.84] P:1489.55 E:0.107599 |  or that interested in what he needs to do
[6047.84 - 6049.84] P:1444.12 E:0.092912 |  and he's made those two changes
[6049.84 - 6051.84] P:1438.45 E:0.108193 |  but he's still sitting over on this left hand side
[6051.84 - 6053.84] P:1312.44 E:0.106570 |  not really having much impact
[6053.84 - 6055.84] P:1234.43 E:0.087314 |  I have to say I do feel fulfilled Forden
[6055.84 - 6057.84] P:1362.09 E:0.093783 |  and he had a super first half
[6057.84 - 6059.84] P:1397.12 E:0.097847 |  and again
[6059.84 - 6061.84] P:1439.25 E:0.079941 |  he's done everything
[6061.84 - 6063.84] P:1344.11 E:0.102496 |  but score there and then his frustration
[6063.84 - 6065.84] P:1644.50 E:0.102668 |  drew in the second period
[6065.84 - 6067.84] P:1459.74 E:0.097543 |  and it probably was going to be
[6067.84 - 6069.84] P:1514.77 E:0.103065 |  either him or Bellingham in the end it was
[6069.84 - 6071.84] P:1534.43 E:0.088487 |  it was Forden
[6071.84 - 6073.84] P:1502.33 E:0.103733 |  Cole goes back to
[6073.84 - 6075.84] P:1557.58 E:0.091752 |  Pickford
[6077.84 - 6079.84] P:1694.09 E:0.099250 |  then Mark Gay
[6079.84 - 6081.84] P:1479.95 E:0.108639 |  and actually
[6081.84 - 6083.84] P:1539.76 E:0.107736 |  Bellingham has dropped all the way back
[6083.84 - 6085.84] P:1502.16 E:0.102906 |  into the back line almost
[6085.84 - 6087.84] P:1393.28 E:0.104398 |  to receive the ball from Pickford
[6087.84 - 6089.84] P:1494.75 E:0.094044 |  John Stones
[6089.84 - 6091.84] P:1401.86 E:0.096683 |  little ball over the half
[6091.84 - 6093.84] P:1688.93 E:0.093087 |  where line Palmer's first touches
[6093.84 - 6095.84] P:1699.87 E:0.086487 |  assured well struck back to Bellingham
[6095.84 - 6097.84] P:1573.81 E:0.074389 |  into the last 10 minutes
[6097.84 - 6099.84] P:1564.22 E:0.104696 |  reaching the stage of this match
[6099.84 - 6101.84] P:1469.65 E:0.094365 |  where now with the score
[6101.84 - 6103.84] P:1602.92 E:0.092570 |  level at 1-1 on 5 live
[6103.84 - 6105.84] P:1593.97 E:0.087174 |  and the World Service
[6105.84 - 6107.84] P:1722.89 E:0.114862 |  next goal might be enough to take the team
[6107.84 - 6109.84] P:1575.96 E:0.103386 |  into the final whoever is able to score it
[6109.84 - 6111.84] P:1674.38 E:0.072015 |  shouting
[6111.84 - 6113.84] P:1553.93 E:0.094448 |  then back to Reinders
[6113.84 - 6115.84] P:1446.22 E:0.085432 |  Watkins just
[6115.84 - 6117.84] P:1586.34 E:0.103628 |  patrolling the area next to him
[6117.84 - 6119.84] P:1423.94 E:0.096004 |  Palmer as well now Watkins
[6119.84 - 6121.84] P:1465.85 E:0.098187 |  again is putting shouting under pressure
[6121.84 - 6123.84] P:1323.42 E:0.099924 |  and then DeVry goes back to
[6123.84 - 6125.84] P:1435.47 E:0.097550 |  Van Dijk
[6125.84 - 6127.84] P:1626.33 E:0.089687 |  Virgil Van Dijk
[6127.84 - 6129.84] P:1431.63 E:0.096570 |  gets the ball back from shouting
[6129.84 - 6131.84] P:1577.42 E:0.120475 |  and Dijk just
[6131.84 - 6133.84] P:1399.06 E:0.104197 |  stares forward
[6133.84 - 6135.84] P:1392.17 E:0.108669 |  ball at his feet
[6135.84 - 6137.84] P:1387.57 E:0.102598 |  back it comes to the captain
[6137.84 - 6139.84] P:1447.67 E:0.093247 |  shouting virtually
[6139.84 - 6141.84] P:1342.94 E:0.104558 |  part of the back line
[6141.84 - 6143.84] P:1228.51 E:0.108011 |  as England put the press on
[6143.84 - 6145.84] P:1458.41 E:0.088692 |  Shaw didn't quite work there
[6145.84 - 6147.84] P:1404.91 E:0.109212 |  England press again
[6147.84 - 6149.84] P:1558.25 E:0.104115 |  Reiss it is now on DeVry
[6149.84 - 6151.84] P:1560.08 E:0.106713 |  and then on the goalkeeper for Brogan
[6151.84 - 6153.84] P:1593.98 E:0.104409 |  who puts his foot on the ball
[6153.84 - 6155.84] P:1688.27 E:0.089294 |  Cole Palmer over there to Van Dijk
[6155.84 - 6157.84] P:1515.29 E:0.097626 |  trying to play around this
[6157.84 - 6159.84] P:1475.76 E:0.099700 |  Reinders, Palmer chasing after him
[6159.84 - 6161.84] P:1463.57 E:0.096262 |  Reinders still going down the left wing
[6161.84 - 6163.84] P:1777.25 E:0.113329 |  in field that's lovely
[6163.84 - 6165.84] P:1676.47 E:0.110766 |  Ake Reinders now down the right
[6165.84 - 6167.84] P:1646.25 E:0.103927 |  still Reinders his ball across
[6167.84 - 6169.84] P:1858.72 E:0.097635 |  Vogue Veghorst is there
[6169.84 - 6171.84] P:1729.86 E:0.113460 |  excellent challenge from Gea
[6171.84 - 6173.84] P:1907.83 E:0.102762 |  you just put himself in there next to
[6173.84 - 6175.84] P:1962.68 E:0.102253 |  Veghorst and the ball bounce down for Pickford
[6175.84 - 6177.84] P:1985.89 E:0.112502 |  brilliant play from the Dutch the way they move it
[6177.84 - 6179.84] P:1956.46 E:0.094479 |  the way they pass it with base
[6179.84 - 6181.84] P:1997.28 E:0.090903 |  from the goalkeeper right through to defence
[6181.84 - 6183.84] P:1798.74 E:0.079309 |  to the midfield and then into England's back
[6183.84 - 6185.84] P:1947.53 E:0.110630 |  into the defensive area of England
[6185.84 - 6187.84] P:1984.10 E:0.100952 |  and they're looking to get the ball in
[6187.84 - 6189.84] P:1966.67 E:0.080453 |  for Vogue and he just can't get the connection
[6189.84 - 6191.84] P:1835.28 E:0.085413 |  what he wants but it was brilliant
[6191.84 - 6193.84] P:1709.16 E:0.084210 |  passing from the Dutch
[6193.84 - 6195.84] P:1688.96 E:0.082157 |  Netherlands best move of the match
[6195.84 - 6197.84] P:1676.30 E:0.088230 |  one-one the score
[6197.84 - 6199.84] P:1508.58 E:0.086079 |  England have not tested
[6199.84 - 6201.84] P:1511.00 E:0.080053 |  for Brogan in the second half
[6201.84 - 6203.84] P:1639.45 E:0.108042 |  but for all the chances they had in the first period
[6203.84 - 6205.84] P:1402.75 E:0.095177 |  when there was lots of positivity
[6205.84 - 6207.84] P:1597.59 E:0.080023 |  brought Luke Shaw on at half time
[6207.84 - 6209.84] P:1638.77 E:0.104031 |  it felt like that was a positive move
[6209.84 - 6211.84] P:1535.84 E:0.101415 |  but the changes that Ronald Kuhmann
[6211.84 - 6213.84] P:1530.30 E:0.097584 |  made have made it more difficult
[6213.84 - 6215.84] P:1543.23 E:0.101610 |  more awkward for England
[6215.84 - 6217.84] P:1571.31 E:0.104748 |  they've become more difficult opponents to play against
[6217.84 - 6219.84] P:1416.07 E:0.112178 |  Stones long pass from inside his own half
[6219.84 - 6221.84] P:1412.10 E:0.095622 |  Watkins on the chase it's headed away
[6221.84 - 6223.84] P:1537.87 E:0.095842 |  a little slip from Bellingham so Shouten gets there first
[6223.84 - 6225.84] P:1416.22 E:0.103457 |  Bellingham tries to step in in front of that
[6225.84 - 6227.84] P:1468.92 E:0.091619 |  Bellingham goes again
[6227.84 - 6229.84] P:1651.93 E:0.100854 |  now Luke Shaw with Dumfries leans into him
[6229.84 - 6231.84] P:1738.10 E:0.101214 |  Bellingham's there with a flick
[6231.84 - 6233.84] P:1603.22 E:0.110287 |  Shaw is there as well bounces up to
[6233.84 - 6235.84] P:1803.52 E:0.123171 |  Veghorst and the free kick has given England's way
[6235.84 - 6237.84] P:1932.57 E:0.114426 |  Bellingham wins the free kick
[6237.84 - 6239.84] P:2008.07 E:0.118319 |  Seymons is absolutely rating about that
[6239.84 - 6241.84] P:2005.76 E:0.110696 |  you can see why as well
[6241.84 - 6243.84] P:2020.75 E:0.109487 |  that was never a free kick
[6243.84 - 6245.84] P:1919.37 E:0.101880 |  I never thought that was a free kick at all
[6245.84 - 6247.84] P:1896.69 E:0.080303 |  that was a fair challenge
[6247.84 - 6249.84] P:1731.52 E:0.097073 |  however Bellingham reacted
[6249.84 - 6251.84] P:1706.37 E:0.094464 |  by trying to raise the England fans
[6251.84 - 6253.84] P:1618.53 E:0.097803 |  many of whom are down in the stand in front of us here
[6253.84 - 6255.84] P:1753.26 E:0.088914 |  so free kick set piece
[6255.84 - 6257.84] P:1842.95 E:0.086799 |  Shaw actually takes it short to game
[6257.84 - 6259.84] P:1830.42 E:0.095490 |  we're in the 85th minute
[6259.84 - 6261.84] P:1684.90 E:0.080527 |  so extra time not too far away
[6261.84 - 6263.84] P:1534.02 E:0.081921 |  he has Manu
[6263.84 - 6265.84] P:1499.75 E:0.099588 |  Rice stretching
[6265.84 - 6267.84] P:1721.86 E:0.128222 |  and Manu into the challenge
[6267.84 - 6269.84] P:1838.46 E:0.109458 |  the referee says
[6269.84 - 6271.84] P:1742.37 E:0.104347 |  the duch are in possession so he plays the advantage
[6271.84 - 6273.84] P:1729.06 E:0.100870 |  Seymons now clips it out to
[6273.84 - 6275.84] P:1789.64 E:0.105344 |  Gakpo over there on the far side
[6275.84 - 6277.84] P:1788.86 E:0.108897 |  Walker turning in field
[6277.84 - 6279.84] P:1846.21 E:0.116187 |  a challenge by Bukayo Saka
[6279.84 - 6281.84] P:1761.78 E:0.104374 |  sent him flying Gakpo to free kick
[6281.84 - 6283.84] P:1884.35 E:0.099986 |  and Bukayo Saka
[6283.84 - 6285.84] P:1859.59 E:0.092221 |  might be fortunate
[6285.84 - 6287.84] P:1897.37 E:0.111141 |  not to be booked for that set piece
[6289.84 - 6291.84] P:1771.76 E:0.101940 |  he just shoves him in the back doesn't he
[6291.84 - 6293.84] P:1690.36 E:0.102431 |  Gakpo that's their threat there's no doubt about it
[6293.84 - 6295.84] P:1778.78 E:0.095478 |  I said it earlier about
[6295.84 - 6297.84] P:1733.14 E:0.098559 |  Gakpo and Seymons either side
[6297.84 - 6299.84] P:1684.17 E:0.093226 |  of Veghorst and Seymons
[6299.84 - 6301.84] P:1720.94 E:0.111723 |  picking the ball up and he has the options
[6301.84 - 6303.84] P:1670.89 E:0.101469 |  of either Veghorst to his right
[6303.84 - 6305.84] P:1792.66 E:0.091922 |  or to the left Gakpo he picks him out
[6305.84 - 6307.84] P:1843.84 E:0.110890 |  this is a really dangerous area again
[6307.84 - 6309.84] P:1597.90 E:0.087437 |  on the left hand side
[6309.84 - 6311.84] P:1659.08 E:0.097180 |  and you know what's going to happen there's going to be whipped in with pace
[6311.84 - 6313.84] P:1634.68 E:0.098987 |  trying to find one of the big centre halves
[6313.84 - 6315.84] P:1642.47 E:0.091938 |  that would both come up
[6315.84 - 6317.84] P:1842.20 E:0.100570 |  it is a yellow card
[6317.84 - 6319.84] P:1467.76 E:0.093229 |  for Saka
[6319.84 - 6321.84] P:1666.62 E:0.111358 |  felt as though it had to be
[6321.84 - 6323.84] P:1706.85 E:0.104333 |  so we're going to see Theamon playing this free kick again
[6323.84 - 6325.84] P:1754.28 E:0.108175 |  he's proved already in this match
[6325.84 - 6329.84] P:1689.40 E:0.101712 |  that he has a very dangerous delivery
[6329.84 - 6331.84] P:1747.12 E:0.110401 |  the Dutch number 16
[6331.84 - 6333.84] P:1662.30 E:0.104205 |  standing out towards the left hand side
[6333.84 - 6335.84] P:1766.01 E:0.103455 |  England have got a two man wall there
[6335.84 - 6337.84] P:1689.35 E:0.108548 |  with the delivery into the box
[6337.84 - 6339.84] P:1701.65 E:0.105715 |  lots of movement
[6339.84 - 6341.84] P:1775.08 E:0.098027 |  Theamon plays it in van Dijk on the stretch
[6341.84 - 6343.84] P:1687.38 E:0.098936 |  couldn't get there and it's all the way through
[6343.84 - 6345.84] P:1777.43 E:0.088720 |  Veghorst van Dijk
[6345.84 - 6347.84] P:1826.93 E:0.104862 |  and the referee says
[6347.84 - 6349.84] P:1891.96 E:0.091651 |  goal kick and van Dijk is hopping there
[6349.84 - 6351.84] P:1716.83 E:0.112915 |  and there's a yellow card
[6351.84 - 6353.84] P:1818.11 E:0.105591 |  I presume to be the Dutch captain van Dijk
[6353.84 - 6355.84] P:1870.32 E:0.101401 |  for his reaction to that
[6355.84 - 6357.84] P:1898.24 E:0.103506 |  I understand his reaction because it should have been the corner
[6357.84 - 6359.84] P:1824.37 E:0.099485 |  it was John Storn's that flipped it by
[6359.84 - 6361.84] P:1834.19 E:0.093887 |  referee got it wrong again
[6361.84 - 6363.84] P:1739.16 E:0.084801 |  I'm really surprised with the delivery there actually
[6363.84 - 6365.84] P:1711.99 E:0.104140 |  after seeing his last ball in
[6365.84 - 6367.84] P:1710.87 E:0.090869 |  he just kind of like
[6367.84 - 6369.84] P:1654.51 E:0.089596 |  chips this one up to the back post
[6369.84 - 6371.84] P:1702.19 E:0.091385 |  it was hard to
[6371.84 - 6373.84] P:1684.92 E:0.090794 |  if you're going to get any contact on this it's hard to score
[6373.84 - 6375.84] P:1617.34 E:0.081391 |  with the ball
[6375.84 - 6377.84] P:1760.12 E:0.096908 |  with so little pace on it
[6377.84 - 6379.84] P:1429.49 E:0.102765 |  and he's shown he's got the ability to whip that with real
[6379.84 - 6381.84] P:1753.80 E:0.074322 |  fierce kind of speed to the ball
[6381.84 - 6383.84] P:1383.43 E:0.093415 |  I thought that was going to be the delivery
[6383.84 - 6385.84] P:1483.41 E:0.106042 |  that Theamon was going to put in
[6385.84 - 6387.84] P:1429.31 E:0.092261 |  Are you ready for more extra time
[6387.84 - 6389.84] P:1597.42 E:0.106537 |  with England again Matt?
[6389.84 - 6391.84] P:1520.73 E:0.107115 |  Always John always ready
[6391.84 - 6393.84] P:1482.06 E:0.092738 |  Just though it's heading that way
[6393.84 - 6395.84] P:1555.74 E:0.098059 |  it's John Storn's
[6395.84 - 6397.84] P:1533.34 E:0.115294 |  I must say it's been very good tonight John Storn's
[6397.84 - 6399.84] P:1417.68 E:0.104556 |  Pickford receives it from him
[6399.84 - 6401.84] P:1569.84 E:0.114871 |  and then over arms it out
[6401.84 - 6403.84] P:1320.59 E:0.099726 |  three minutes to go
[6403.84 - 6405.84] P:1446.19 E:0.114608 |  plus added time
[6405.84 - 6407.84] P:1518.20 E:0.102777 |  Gareth Southgate stands down there impassively
[6407.84 - 6409.84] P:1555.66 E:0.107472 |  If it goes England's way
[6409.84 - 6411.84] P:1651.46 E:0.100895 |  over the course of the next half hour
[6411.84 - 6413.84] P:1537.71 E:0.105365 |  you'll become the first man to take England
[6413.84 - 6415.84] P:1573.95 E:0.105515 |  to a final overseas
[6415.84 - 6417.84] P:1299.67 E:0.102900 |  but it feels like it's still quite a long way away
[6417.84 - 6419.84] P:1193.01 E:0.117320 |  Bellingham back to Rice
[6419.84 - 6421.84] P:1411.24 E:0.099295 |  now Oli Watkins
[6421.84 - 6423.84] P:1405.37 E:0.093491 |  Mark Gayne here at the centre circle
[6423.84 - 6425.84] P:1345.52 E:0.090653 |  Walker with a pass out
[6425.84 - 6427.84] P:1341.73 E:0.102566 |  towards the figure of
[6427.84 - 6429.84] P:1415.63 E:0.112695 |  Bukai Osaka
[6429.84 - 6431.84] P:1383.00 E:0.101991 |  challenged by Nathan Aki
[6431.84 - 6433.84] P:1451.11 E:0.090336 |  and then Sakai just sees an opening
[6433.84 - 6435.84] P:1345.14 E:0.099808 |  so he takes it on left foot of Bokai
[6435.84 - 6437.84] P:1443.16 E:0.104612 |  towards the left hand side
[6437.84 - 6439.84] P:1686.91 E:0.104074 |  Shaw is there, gets the ball under control
[6439.84 - 6441.84] P:1661.34 E:0.105472 |  Shaw's ball across
[6441.84 - 6443.84] P:1821.33 E:0.100611 |  Watkins on the stretch
[6443.84 - 6445.84] P:1807.70 E:0.105157 |  Parma shoots across goal
[6445.84 - 6447.84] P:1704.92 E:0.082977 |  wildly
[6447.84 - 6449.84] P:1713.95 E:0.095252 |  sliced it really
[6449.84 - 6451.84] P:1655.76 E:0.105054 |  low fives between Van Dijk
[6451.84 - 6453.84] P:1651.64 E:0.091174 |  and De Vries
[6453.84 - 6455.84] P:1632.28 E:0.105753 |  It's a really good ball from the left hand side
[6455.84 - 6457.84] P:1707.28 E:0.106277 |  from Rookshaw, they switch the play
[6457.84 - 6459.84] P:1738.46 E:0.094069 |  the long ball across and he takes the touch
[6459.84 - 6461.84] P:1636.66 E:0.099605 |  Shaw just puts it into the middle
[6461.84 - 6463.84] P:1680.45 E:0.093502 |  hoping that Watkins is going to get it on the end
[6463.84 - 6465.84] P:1872.56 E:0.104548 |  of it but he makes his run just that little bit
[6465.84 - 6467.84] P:1589.39 E:0.084796 |  too quick and it goes past him
[6467.84 - 6469.84] P:1810.73 E:0.074464 |  but falls to Parma
[6469.84 - 6471.84] P:1714.59 E:0.071915 |  just can't get it on target
[6471.84 - 6473.84] P:1500.38 E:0.079239 |  So goal kick
[6473.84 - 6475.84] P:1457.80 E:0.104952 |  it is
[6475.84 - 6477.84] P:1486.27 E:0.098641 |  and there's just a little lull in the noise
[6477.84 - 6479.84] P:1599.93 E:0.102722 |  around this cavernous stadium
[6481.84 - 6483.84] P:1269.54 E:0.109422 |  brilliant setting
[6483.84 - 6485.84] P:1557.45 E:0.104129 |  I remember watching the Germany-Italy
[6485.84 - 6487.84] P:1562.01 E:0.103430 |  World Cup semi-final
[6487.84 - 6489.84] P:1409.66 E:0.105932 |  in this stadium, that was an epic
[6489.84 - 6491.84] P:1520.16 E:0.104251 |  that went to extra time as well before the Italians
[6491.84 - 6493.84] P:1696.20 E:0.095160 |  shocked and knocked out
[6493.84 - 6495.84] P:1650.93 E:0.093886 |  the hosts
[6495.84 - 6497.84] P:1723.97 E:0.113412 |  this one level up 1-1
[6497.84 - 6499.84] P:1897.55 E:0.115889 |  Gage is eased over
[6499.84 - 6501.84] P:1871.03 E:0.115940 |  by Gatko, again the Dutch fans are furious
[6501.84 - 6503.84] P:1975.28 E:0.115275 |  that's not a foul
[6503.84 - 6505.84] P:2031.08 E:0.109732 |  no chance, is that a foul
[6505.84 - 6507.84] P:2007.82 E:0.108892 |  I can see why they're furious, the players are
[6507.84 - 6509.84] P:1899.65 E:0.101184 |  Well there's been a feeling
[6509.84 - 6511.84] P:1809.44 E:0.077808 |  among the Dutch fans that
[6511.84 - 6513.84] P:1747.31 E:0.085531 |  this was a bad appointment
[6513.84 - 6515.84] P:1818.79 E:0.090413 |  because of the history
[6515.84 - 6517.84] P:1636.22 E:0.102787 |  so it's in their heads already
[6517.84 - 6519.84] P:1772.77 E:0.066174 |  goal kick then
[6519.84 - 6521.84] P:1667.06 E:0.078050 |  free kick then, England played out
[6521.84 - 6523.84] P:1551.27 E:0.102400 |  towards the right-handside
[6523.84 - 6525.84] P:1737.11 E:0.089690 |  Walker, who's again, as the vice-captain
[6525.84 - 6527.84] P:1612.03 E:0.099207 |  Kyle Walker taking the arm band after
[6527.84 - 6529.84] P:1645.16 E:0.096262 |  Harry Kane went off and certainly
[6529.84 - 6531.84] P:1700.80 E:0.105704 |  Oli Watkins as you suggested would be the case
[6531.84 - 6533.84] P:1419.11 E:0.080838 |  Alan, you know, there is certainly
[6533.84 - 6535.84] P:1522.31 E:0.094828 |  he's brought something to England
[6535.84 - 6537.84] P:1569.78 E:0.098168 |  up front, the movement that he has
[6537.84 - 6539.84] P:1461.18 E:0.100662 |  as Parma is being chased back into his
[6539.84 - 6541.84] P:1565.14 E:0.100305 |  own half, gives it back towards Walker
[6541.84 - 6543.84] P:1615.71 E:0.095798 |  Walker all the way back to Pickford
[6543.84 - 6545.84] P:1586.16 E:0.096467 |  Pickford just allows the ball to roll
[6545.84 - 6547.84] P:1506.74 E:0.087124 |  onto his left foot and then passes
[6547.84 - 6549.84] P:1403.61 E:0.105086 |  it out to Mark Gay almost in the left
[6549.84 - 6551.84] P:1495.05 E:0.102506 |  back position, Gay is being pressed by
[6551.84 - 6553.84] P:1588.96 E:0.090745 |  Simon so plays it
[6553.84 - 6555.84] P:1522.16 E:0.087154 |  back to the goalkeeper, now
[6555.84 - 6557.84] P:1482.39 E:0.107142 |  John Stones receives it from him
[6557.84 - 6559.84] P:1454.69 E:0.103622 |  we're in the 90th minute
[6559.84 - 6561.84] P:1613.30 E:0.103895 |  the score is still 1-1
[6561.84 - 6563.84] P:1585.17 E:0.089475 |  John Stones
[6565.84 - 6567.84] P:1506.98 E:0.094011 |  Declan Rice
[6567.84 - 6569.84] P:1475.80 E:0.109275 |  comes short
[6569.84 - 6571.84] P:1454.08 E:0.096562 |  and then a stretch by
[6571.84 - 6573.84] P:1559.25 E:0.110420 |  Manu, Parma is able to take up
[6573.84 - 6575.84] P:1657.59 E:0.106335 |  possession of the ball, Parma, lovely ball to
[6575.84 - 6577.84] P:1705.35 E:0.115105 |  Watkins inside the area, Watkins
[6577.84 - 6579.84] P:1978.90 E:0.099826 |  Oli scored
[6579.84 - 6581.84] P:1844.30 E:0.106803 |  Watkins from an impossible angle
[6581.84 - 6583.84] P:1814.76 E:0.111655 |  across for Brogan and into
[6583.84 - 6585.84] P:1788.13 E:0.106741 |  the far bottom corner
[6585.84 - 6587.84] P:1889.78 E:0.112205 |  what a strike that is
[6587.84 - 6589.84] P:1766.82 E:0.099112 |  Ramon Oli Watkins
[6589.84 - 6591.84] P:1781.07 E:0.114618 |  big part in this
[6591.84 - 6593.84] P:1762.25 E:0.105446 |  England squad but the hero
[6593.84 - 6595.84] P:1615.12 E:0.113270 |  of the semifinal in Dortmund
[6595.84 - 6597.84] P:1768.31 E:0.103720 |  what a finish, Netherlands
[6597.84 - 6599.84] P:1704.68 E:0.112403 |  won, England 2
[6599.84 - 6601.84] P:1705.36 E:0.111116 |  and we're into added time in the
[6601.84 - 6603.84] P:1742.98 E:0.106572 |  semifinal, it seems England
[6603.84 - 6605.84] P:1671.68 E:0.096857 |  are set for Berlin
[6605.84 - 6607.84] P:1718.75 E:0.099287 |  thanks to Oli Watkins
[6607.84 - 6609.84] P:1661.28 E:0.110641 |  that is a sensational finish
[6609.84 - 6611.84] P:1645.27 E:0.109215 |  that's what he offers, he ran in
[6611.84 - 6613.84] P:1687.81 E:0.105412 |  behind, he wanted the ball delivered
[6613.84 - 6615.84] P:1644.93 E:0.103909 |  it was delivered, he took the touch
[6615.84 - 6617.84] P:1804.56 E:0.106161 |  what a turn, what a finish, the keeper's
[6617.84 - 6619.84] P:1686.94 E:0.107549 |  got no chance, he finds the bottom
[6619.84 - 6621.84] P:1573.33 E:0.070151 |  of the net
[6621.84 - 6623.84] P:1803.26 E:0.112953 |  that's what you want when you put a substitute
[6623.84 - 6625.84] P:1862.01 E:0.102929 |  on, you need him to impact the game
[6625.84 - 6627.84] P:1640.21 E:0.105671 |  that's what he brought him on for, for that
[6627.84 - 6629.84] P:1675.95 E:0.097113 |  run, for that touch and for that
[6629.84 - 6631.84] P:1694.20 E:0.092243 |  finish
[6631.84 - 6633.84] P:1542.89 E:0.105342 |  from the England fans in the stands
[6633.84 - 6635.84] P:1652.99 E:0.104795 |  the players on the pitch racing
[6635.84 - 6637.84] P:1772.88 E:0.108095 |  to Oli Watkins and also all
[6637.84 - 6639.84] P:1800.67 E:0.098353 |  of the coaches, Harry Kane
[6639.84 - 6641.84] P:1651.74 E:0.109679 |  the substitutes running down the line
[6641.84 - 6643.84] P:1625.93 E:0.096371 |  some of them came onto the pitch
[6643.84 - 6645.84] P:1612.60 E:0.113421 |  Izzy down pitch side, what was the reaction
[6645.84 - 6647.84] P:1652.03 E:0.113240 |  like from the England fans in the stands
[6647.84 - 6649.84] P:1712.24 E:0.112216 |  Oh my word, they have gone
[6649.84 - 6651.84] P:1676.18 E:0.107829 |  into absolute overdrive
[6651.84 - 6653.84] P:1712.20 E:0.118040 |  the arms, the shirts
[6653.84 - 6655.84] P:1734.43 E:0.119107 |  everything is in the air
[6655.84 - 6657.84] P:1580.34 E:0.113708 |  waving, so many of them are climbing
[6657.84 - 6659.84] P:1632.77 E:0.116031 |  upon the barriers, unbelievable
[6659.84 - 6661.84] P:1644.69 E:0.110034 |  the scenes and there's a red flag going on
[6663.84 - 6665.84] P:1652.56 E:0.099528 |  the Dutch, Ronald Koeman, what an
[6665.84 - 6667.84] P:1589.28 E:0.089507 |  agonising moment that was for him
[6667.84 - 6669.84] P:1718.03 E:0.107500 |  the goal going in just as
[6669.84 - 6671.84] P:1563.96 E:0.094988 |  we moved into added time
[6671.84 - 6673.84] P:1605.15 E:0.098830 |  Oli Watkins
[6673.84 - 6675.84] P:1655.85 E:0.100328 |  well with question Matt
[6675.84 - 6677.84] P:1403.35 E:0.109899 |  you and I when we've been commentating on
[6677.84 - 6679.84] P:1606.24 E:0.098611 |  England matches, whether he had it
[6679.84 - 6681.84] P:1494.08 E:0.100657 |  at international level, he had it there
[6681.84 - 6683.84] P:1527.07 E:0.098256 |  he's answered that question
[6683.84 - 6685.84] P:1464.61 E:0.101064 |  I mean, how quick did he
[6685.84 - 6687.84] P:1701.10 E:0.110036 |  take it, it was like a lovely swivel
[6687.84 - 6689.84] P:1529.24 E:0.107314 |  and hit all in one
[6689.84 - 6691.84] P:1766.53 E:0.104926 |  I just think it caught De Vrij out
[6691.84 - 6693.84] P:1691.84 E:0.103096 |  it was the covering defender going across
[6693.84 - 6695.84] P:1705.73 E:0.099599 |  with that diagonal running to the
[6695.84 - 6697.84] P:1630.04 E:0.096315 |  side of the box, but the
[6697.84 - 6699.84] P:1741.71 E:0.102241 |  speed in which he's turned and hit it
[6699.84 - 6701.84] P:1802.26 E:0.099514 |  it's just caught him off guard
[6701.84 - 6703.84] P:1756.73 E:0.094112 |  right through his legs and it's just
[6703.84 - 6705.84] P:1670.95 E:0.106625 |  nestled just inside the post
[6705.84 - 6707.84] P:1657.21 E:0.095921 |  it's absolutely inch perfect
[6707.84 - 6709.84] P:1745.86 E:0.097634 |  that finish, what a goal
[6709.84 - 6711.84] P:1720.57 E:0.103856 |  listen, there's a rash of substitutions being made
[6711.84 - 6713.84] P:1569.56 E:0.104530 |  now, Saka's coming off, Konza's coming on
[6713.84 - 6715.84] P:1549.29 E:0.109511 |  what you need to know by the way, we haven't
[6715.84 - 6717.84] P:1611.85 E:0.101088 |  said it yet, there are only
[6717.84 - 6719.84] P:1502.48 E:0.102884 |  two minutes of added time
[6719.84 - 6721.84] P:1482.19 E:0.100696 |  of being added on
[6721.84 - 6723.84] P:1589.62 E:0.105393 |  the Dutch are making changes
[6723.84 - 6725.84] P:1478.92 E:0.092049 |  they're going to bring on
[6725.84 - 6727.84] P:1603.28 E:0.112053 |  Zerkse as well, who we might
[6727.84 - 6729.84] P:1444.68 E:0.103737 |  see at Manchester United next season
[6729.84 - 6731.84] P:1498.77 E:0.110647 |  it's a double
[6731.84 - 6733.84] P:1673.70 E:0.109518 |  change, also the
[6733.84 - 6735.84] P:1662.79 E:0.104482 |  young Ajax striker Brian
[6735.84 - 6737.84] P:1546.57 E:0.110707 |  Robby is going to come on, this is his first appearance
[6737.84 - 6739.84] P:1490.01 E:0.113249 |  of the tournament, so Simon's comes
[6739.84 - 6741.84] P:1434.15 E:0.106215 |  off and Colin Gallagat
[6741.84 - 6743.84] P:1426.85 E:0.114052 |  came on for Cobby Mayn who into the midfield
[6743.84 - 6745.84] P:1498.92 E:0.110978 |  we know where this is
[6745.84 - 6747.84] P:1665.67 E:0.105258 |  Bola's going back to the goalkeeper and
[6747.84 - 6749.84] P:1613.36 E:0.093211 |  straight up front
[6749.84 - 6751.84] P:1654.44 E:0.118879 |  England
[6751.84 - 6753.84] P:1705.52 E:0.107756 |  now just trying to organise themselves
[6753.84 - 6755.84] P:1477.73 E:0.101059 |  Konza has
[6755.84 - 6757.84] P:1520.56 E:0.106464 |  gone to the right side of the three
[6757.84 - 6759.84] P:1728.42 E:0.105229 |  so it is very much a back five
[6759.84 - 6761.84] P:1644.12 E:0.089402 |  now for England
[6761.84 - 6763.84] P:1585.97 E:0.098093 |  and I already, we're in the fourth
[6763.84 - 6765.84] P:1669.56 E:0.095489 |  minute of added time now
[6765.84 - 6767.84] P:1713.91 E:0.110056 |  so it's all up to referee Felix
[6767.84 - 6769.84] P:1554.35 E:0.100286 |  Weier how long will be added
[6769.84 - 6771.84] P:1676.25 E:0.101376 |  on, the score, Netherlands
[6771.84 - 6773.84] P:1692.70 E:0.096127 |  England two, Beckholz tries to
[6773.84 - 6775.84] P:1718.25 E:0.094621 |  flick this ball on, Rice
[6775.84 - 6777.84] P:1773.29 E:0.108455 |  now with a stretch, Rice gets it down
[6777.84 - 6779.84] P:1663.91 E:0.107090 |  Rice takes it away to the half-way line
[6779.84 - 6781.84] P:1517.28 E:0.108314 |  past Ake, Col Parma is almost in on this
[6781.84 - 6783.84] P:1459.00 E:0.103704 |  Parma is on this but can't play
[6783.84 - 6785.84] P:1248.04 E:0.100516 |  it square and
[6785.84 - 6787.84] P:1565.84 E:0.081568 |  the Dutch back in possession
[6787.84 - 6789.84] P:1750.40 E:0.111567 |  Konza Gallagat chasing that ball, gets
[6789.84 - 6791.84] P:1736.21 E:0.113923 |  there ahead of Zerkse and deflects it
[6791.84 - 6793.84] P:1736.66 E:0.114042 |  out of play, three and a
[6793.84 - 6795.84] P:1683.16 E:0.114840 |  half minutes of added time have been played
[6795.84 - 6797.84] P:1558.49 E:0.104438 |  there's a yellow card coming out for
[6797.84 - 6799.84] P:1629.90 E:0.098723 |  someone on the England bench
[6799.84 - 6801.84] P:1580.30 E:0.104603 |  who's out of our sight underneath the
[6801.84 - 6803.84] P:1516.73 E:0.093342 |  roof of the dugout
[6803.84 - 6805.84] P:1530.17 E:0.116018 |  difficult to know who that was
[6805.84 - 6807.84] P:1500.47 E:0.107328 |  not sure it was Garry Southgate
[6807.84 - 6809.84] P:1340.31 E:0.108561 |  I think it was someone who was left
[6809.84 - 6811.84] P:1557.30 E:0.110963 |  anyway, we're only seconds away now
[6811.84 - 6813.84] P:1533.77 E:0.100662 |  England seconds away
[6813.84 - 6815.84] P:1596.02 E:0.104183 |  from a place
[6815.84 - 6817.84] P:1738.40 E:0.105132 |  in the final
[6817.84 - 6819.84] P:1542.24 E:0.112218 |  Shaw, heading it forward, another
[6819.84 - 6821.84] P:1474.57 E:0.100899 |  late show for England here
[6821.84 - 6823.84] P:1599.14 E:0.103170 |  with a truly stunning strike
[6823.84 - 6825.84] P:1591.50 E:0.106517 |  a surprising strike from
[6825.84 - 6827.84] P:1721.07 E:0.103462 |  Oli Watkins, Parma gives it away
[6827.84 - 6829.84] P:1672.19 E:0.108817 |  Zerkse through the middle, Zerkse
[6829.84 - 6831.84] P:1590.63 E:0.103648 |  tall, huge pair
[6831.84 - 6833.84] P:1501.64 E:0.112018 |  to Ake, now Gagbo on the left
[6833.84 - 6835.84] P:1350.06 E:0.105164 |  Gagbo's high ball into the England
[6835.84 - 6837.84] P:1424.02 E:0.099073 |  punch of the area to the back post, he's headed
[6837.84 - 6839.84] P:1532.19 E:0.104173 |  across the box, but chested down by
[6839.84 - 6841.84] P:1653.31 E:0.108586 |  Bellingham and Bellingham will just take this
[6841.84 - 6843.84] P:1613.24 E:0.097978 |  away downfield, we're now in the fifth
[6843.84 - 6845.84] P:1622.48 E:0.104603 |  minute of added time, depends how long
[6845.84 - 6847.84] P:1707.78 E:0.107164 |  the referee is going to add on here as
[6847.84 - 6849.84] P:1763.30 E:0.098142 |  Bellingham draws the foul
[6849.84 - 6851.84] P:1737.49 E:0.103548 |  winter free kick in front of the
[6851.84 - 6853.84] P:1797.49 E:0.096903 |  dugout and actually
[6853.84 - 6855.84] P:1606.23 E:0.109522 |  three of the England substitutes, Ramsdale,
[6855.84 - 6857.84] P:1681.68 E:0.098896 |  Gordon and Kieran Trippier come in
[6857.84 - 6859.84] P:1702.85 E:0.099896 |  applaud Bellingham for winning the free kick
[6859.84 - 6861.84] P:1514.66 E:0.085043 |  like that
[6861.84 - 6863.84] P:1724.89 E:0.089191 |  free kick to England
[6863.84 - 6865.84] P:1686.61 E:0.092665 |  they're almost there
[6865.84 - 6867.84] P:1541.94 E:0.103079 |  what a finish Alan
[6867.84 - 6869.84] P:1726.75 E:0.098077 |  what a finish, what a substitution
[6869.84 - 6871.84] P:1616.86 E:0.097907 |  that's what he offers
[6871.84 - 6873.84] P:1619.75 E:0.094676 |  what Harry hasn't been doing
[6873.84 - 6875.84] P:1733.87 E:0.109093 |  Harry has brought different qualities, we know
[6875.84 - 6877.84] P:1645.75 E:0.097716 |  that, he's stuck the penalty away really well
[6877.84 - 6879.84] P:1496.97 E:0.100389 |  but that's the one
[6879.84 - 6881.84] P:1552.26 E:0.108348 |  thing that he can do, that's why he brought
[6881.84 - 6883.84] P:1662.33 E:0.112072 |  him on to upset the defence and it's won
[6883.84 - 6885.84] P:1681.49 E:0.122583 |  the game for England
[6885.84 - 6887.84] P:1759.82 E:0.113621 |  there it is, the final whistle
[6887.84 - 6889.84] P:1752.25 E:0.114682 |  here in Dortmund and Harry Kane
[6889.84 - 6891.84] P:1645.27 E:0.111812 |  races onto the pitch
[6891.84 - 6893.84] P:1657.36 E:0.119285 |  and everyone's running to Olly Watkins
[6893.84 - 6895.84] P:1659.93 E:0.105950 |  the match winner
[6895.84 - 6897.84] P:1646.89 E:0.109122 |  perhaps the unlikely match
[6897.84 - 6899.84] P:1505.41 E:0.105786 |  winner
[6899.84 - 6901.84] P:1568.06 E:0.109675 |  Garas Southgate and his coaches
[6901.84 - 6903.84] P:1541.93 E:0.113121 |  celebrate Jimmy Floyd's hassle bank
[6903.84 - 6905.84] P:1404.52 E:0.109366 |  down there
[6905.84 - 6907.84] P:1579.57 E:0.117041 |  the Englishman against his Dutch nation
[6907.84 - 6909.84] P:1514.77 E:0.102228 |  they go across to
[6909.84 - 6911.84] P:1456.24 E:0.097587 |  Ronald Koeman
[6911.84 - 6913.84] P:1513.00 E:0.096459 |  and they are going
[6913.84 - 6915.84] P:1645.99 E:0.101944 |  to Berlin
[6915.84 - 6917.84] P:1710.26 E:0.099394 |  England are going to Berlin to the final
[6917.84 - 6919.84] P:1763.12 E:0.100122 |  and for the first time
[6919.84 - 6921.84] P:1668.66 E:0.098990 |  England will play in a final
[6921.84 - 6923.84] P:1650.30 E:0.093433 |  on foreign soil
[6923.84 - 6925.84] P:1718.62 E:0.095628 |  what a dramatic finish
[6925.84 - 6927.84] P:1539.64 E:0.105377 |  yet again from England
[6927.84 - 6929.84] P:1663.57 E:0.111214 |  Alan Shearer
[6929.84 - 6931.84] P:1740.96 E:0.102940 |  they had to suffer for large periods in that second half
[6931.84 - 6933.84] P:1742.10 E:0.106324 |  because of the switch that Ronald Koeman
[6933.84 - 6935.84] P:1773.32 E:0.112434 |  made, he got men behind the ball
[6935.84 - 6937.84] P:1680.57 E:0.102020 |  they just couldn't find a way
[6937.84 - 6939.84] P:1601.18 E:0.103684 |  and it was crying out for a substitute
[6939.84 - 6941.84] P:1517.93 E:0.108935 |  crying out for someone that could run
[6941.84 - 6943.84] P:1459.15 E:0.100319 |  behind and ask different questions
[6943.84 - 6945.84] P:1623.43 E:0.104747 |  of the two centre halves
[6945.84 - 6947.84] P:1549.51 E:0.107461 |  because they hadn't done that at all in the second half
[6947.84 - 6949.84] P:1589.97 E:0.108019 |  that man was Olly Watkins
[6949.84 - 6951.84] P:1574.59 E:0.114923 |  and he did it perfectly well
[6951.84 - 6953.84] P:1535.25 E:0.109614 |  the ball into him was brilliant
[6953.84 - 6955.84] P:1647.38 E:0.121734 |  but the touch and the finish
[6955.84 - 6957.84] P:1710.47 E:0.095661 |  were still flying, the keeper had no chance
[6957.84 - 6959.84] P:1543.41 E:0.093005 |  into the corner of the net
[6959.84 - 6961.84] P:1471.91 E:0.104602 |  and it's the England fans that you can hear
[6961.84 - 6963.84] P:1532.26 E:0.105726 |  they might have been outnumbered
[6963.84 - 6965.84] P:1522.64 E:0.113585 |  by the Dutch wall and all of this
[6965.84 - 6967.84] P:1563.36 E:0.105389 |  orange, great disappointment
[6967.84 - 6969.84] P:1449.90 E:0.109103 |  for them and Ronald Koeman
[6969.84 - 6972.84] P:1659.23 E:0.103989 |  who have fallen short here
[6972.84 - 6974.84] P:1520.94 E:0.098071 |  after he changed things
[6974.84 - 6976.84] P:1421.26 E:0.109880 |  quite significantly at half time
[6976.84 - 6978.84] P:1562.13 E:0.093029 |  but Olly Watkins, Matt Upsen
[6978.84 - 6980.84] P:1495.34 E:0.098548 |  has won the day
[6980.84 - 6982.84] P:1528.65 E:0.099928 |  that's unbelievable John to be honest
[6982.84 - 6984.84] P:1630.46 E:0.105309 |  I mean there were moments in that second half
[6984.84 - 6986.84] P:1682.97 E:0.093489 |  where you just felt
[6986.84 - 6988.84] P:1743.35 E:0.097294 |  we're in a bit of trouble here
[6988.84 - 6990.84] P:1717.48 E:0.107297 |  there was probably a ten minute spell where the Dutch really got on top
[6990.84 - 6992.84] P:1753.59 E:0.087187 |  put the ball in the box, a few set plays
[6992.84 - 6994.84] P:1634.12 E:0.098136 |  looked threatening
[6994.84 - 6996.84] P:1674.28 E:0.099800 |  we lost our rhythm
[6996.84 - 6998.84] P:1756.11 E:0.104982 |  credit to Gareth Southgate
[6998.84 - 7000.84] P:1641.18 E:0.094667 |  the changes that he made, how he adjusted it
[7000.84 - 7002.84] P:1587.34 E:0.100054 |  has just worked perfectly
[7002.84 - 7004.84] P:1656.14 E:0.085922 |  and the goal
[7004.84 - 7006.84] P:1642.64 E:0.102444 |  was just a thing of beauty from a centre-four perspective
[7006.84 - 7008.84] P:1515.67 E:0.105966 |  I mean the movement
[7008.84 - 7010.84] P:1622.45 E:0.105224 |  and the swivel and the turn and the hit
[7010.84 - 7012.84] P:1688.86 E:0.099911 |  all in one, it was so super sharp
[7012.84 - 7014.84] P:1518.71 E:0.100908 |  that it was just worthy
[7014.84 - 7016.84] P:1784.74 E:0.103793 |  of a winning goal, it was a cracking finish from Watkins
[7016.84 - 7018.84] P:1575.52 E:0.114705 |  Gareth Southgate just going around
[7018.84 - 7020.84] P:1613.51 E:0.116563 |  all of his players out there
[7020.84 - 7022.84] P:1620.12 E:0.105421 |  there's a huge hook for Cobby Nainu
[7022.84 - 7024.84] P:1422.75 E:0.121206 |  who had such a strong performance in the first half
[7024.84 - 7026.84] P:1418.77 E:0.101329 |  and there we are
[7026.84 - 7028.84] P:1673.01 E:0.110085 |  England have confounded the critics
[7028.84 - 7030.84] P:1604.51 E:0.102080 |  again
[7030.84 - 7032.84] P:1473.32 E:0.115519 |  they will be in Berlin on Sunday
[7032.84 - 7034.84] P:1593.81 E:0.104221 |  finalists
[7034.84 - 7036.84] P:1499.58 E:0.114008 |  runners up at Euro 2020
[7036.84 - 7038.84] P:1626.07 E:0.091694 |  now
[7038.84 - 7040.84] P:1745.73 E:0.097904 |  finalists again
[7040.84 - 7042.84] P:1672.37 E:0.104596 |  at Euro 2024
[7042.84 - 7044.84] P:1631.72 E:0.104354 |  and on Sunday night we will have
[7044.84 - 7046.84] P:1800.63 E:0.103027 |  Spain against England for you
[7046.84 - 7048.84] P:1763.76 E:0.086388 |  final score here
[7048.84 - 7050.84] P:1767.90 E:0.085021 |  Netherlands won
[7050.84 - 7052.84] P:1793.84 E:0.091454 |  England two
[7052.84 - 7054.84] P:1632.65 E:0.099621 |  first half
[7054.84 - 7056.84] P:1649.56 E:0.102066 |  and on Sunday night we are going to have
[7056.84 - 7058.84] P:1590.82 E:0.113813 |  a knock-champion
[7058.84 - 7060.84] P:1556.08 E:0.103619 |  again England coming up with drama and tension
[7060.84 - 7062.84] P:1571.45 E:0.115236 |  and Ollie Watkins
[7062.84 - 7064.84] P:1582.63 E:0.105945 |  is on his own in front of the England fans
[7064.84 - 7066.84] P:1542.67 E:0.104307 |  first of all before some of the England players
[7066.84 - 7068.84] P:1608.12 E:0.097128 |  go and join him
[7068.84 - 7070.84] P:1601.78 E:0.114315 |  and the England players let him have that moment
[7070.84 - 7072.84] P:1540.77 E:0.117060 |  in front of the England fans
[7072.84 - 7074.84] P:1752.14 E:0.085450 |  don't the easy he was there on his own
[7074.84 - 7076.84] P:1613.30 E:0.118170 |  for a little bit
[7076.84 - 7078.84] P:1598.98 E:0.103814 |  he was tapping his chest
[7078.84 - 7080.84] P:1795.63 E:0.099783 |  where the England crest is
[7080.84 - 7082.84] P:1661.05 E:0.120278 |  Alan called it in commentary didn't he
[7082.84 - 7084.84] P:1953.83 E:0.092140 |  bring on Watkins but
[7084.84 - 7086.84] P:1779.91 E:0.103697 |  just come on and do that
[7086.84 - 7088.84] P:1703.47 E:0.108621 |  and spoken about in the five live coverage
[7088.84 - 7090.84] P:1697.19 E:0.100190 |  about everybody in this tournament
[7090.84 - 7092.84] P:1617.55 E:0.111188 |  everybody at the place for England
[7092.84 - 7094.84] P:1600.23 E:0.117698 |  and that's Ollie Watkins moment
[7094.84 - 7096.84] P:1659.53 E:0.102414 |  Trent Alexander Arnold had his moment
[7096.84 - 7098.84] P:1641.24 E:0.114268 |  against Switzerland with that winning penalty
[7098.84 - 7100.84] P:1676.96 E:0.107870 |  and to take it and to be ready for it
[7100.84 - 7102.84] P:1619.65 E:0.111997 |  when you need it
[7102.84 - 7104.84] P:1562.04 E:0.108040 |  it's just an unbelievable level of character
[7104.84 - 7106.84] P:1472.50 E:0.105933 |  and resilience
[7106.84 - 7108.84] P:1662.35 E:0.108973 |  and a sense of calm in a moment
[7108.84 - 7110.84] P:1561.94 E:0.103898 |  and the country needed him
[7110.84 - 7112.84] P:1332.92 E:0.100198 |  and Gower Southgate he is owed
[7112.84 - 7114.84] P:1465.03 E:0.102689 |  a lot of credit for the way that he
[7114.84 - 7116.84] P:1366.85 E:0.099806 |  managed that game I'll tell you that
[7116.84 - 7118.84] P:1694.14 E:0.111529 |  they've given
[7118.84 - 7120.84] P:1676.73 E:0.100109 |  Ollie Watkins player of the match
[7120.84 - 7122.84] P:1707.60 E:0.102629 |  they didn't
[7122.84 - 7124.84] P:1670.45 E:0.121472 |  they didn't need to do that John
[7124.84 - 7126.84] P:1700.00 E:0.109698 |  I'm sure he's going to do as many interviews
[7126.84 - 7128.84] P:1592.24 E:0.104442 |  as he gets asked for
[7128.84 - 7130.84] P:1693.45 E:0.110461 |  he doesn't have to do the requisite
[7130.84 - 7132.84] P:1730.13 E:0.105739 |  player of the match one
[7132.84 - 7134.84] P:1732.74 E:0.108183 |  they've sent him again on his own
[7134.84 - 7136.84] P:1688.51 E:0.103682 |  and he's now
[7136.84 - 7138.84] P:1613.53 E:0.111081 |  the singing and dancing down there
[7138.84 - 7140.84] P:1584.09 E:0.099476 |  he's the man who's closest to
[7140.84 - 7142.84] P:1575.94 E:0.110260 |  the stand
[7142.84 - 7144.84] P:1713.31 E:0.099487 |  and really it's taken a while
[7144.84 - 7146.84] P:1650.01 E:0.112227 |  for Ollie Watkins as I was saying
[7146.84 - 7148.84] P:1765.76 E:0.103378 |  for Ollie Watkins
[7148.84 - 7150.84] P:1663.41 E:0.098475 |  you know this is his 14th cap
[7150.84 - 7152.84] P:1654.32 E:0.114605 |  it is his fourth goal
[7152.84 - 7154.84] P:1741.97 E:0.101395 |  but we've never been sure
[7154.84 - 7156.84] P:1636.15 E:0.101300 |  we've never been sure
[7156.84 - 7158.84] P:1625.34 E:0.100536 |  about him in an England
[7158.84 - 7160.84] P:1580.61 E:0.105303 |  show he's never looked quite like
[7160.84 - 7162.84] P:1658.38 E:0.104515 |  the player who's looked so good for Aston
[7162.84 - 7164.84] P:1674.82 E:0.106487 |  Diller
[7164.84 - 7166.84] P:1574.73 E:0.105740 |  who's the collective we
[7166.84 - 7168.84] P:1497.72 E:0.109514 |  there when we've talked
[7168.84 - 7170.84] P:1530.08 E:0.087871 |  about him playing for England
[7170.84 - 7172.84] P:1678.36 E:0.096358 |  yeah but you know he is
[7172.84 - 7174.84] P:1675.75 E:0.104729 |  he's put what he's very
[7174.84 - 7176.84] P:1643.58 E:0.104974 |  very good at it was crying out
[7176.84 - 7178.84] P:1642.93 E:0.110027 |  for that it was crying out for the energy
[7178.84 - 7180.84] P:1723.53 E:0.113774 |  not only just to put
[7180.84 - 7182.84] P:1742.02 E:0.113751 |  the centre hearts under pressure when they had the ball
[7182.84 - 7184.84] P:1756.12 E:0.111568 |  but more importantly
[7184.84 - 7186.84] P:1836.74 E:0.104599 |  for someone to run in behind
[7186.84 - 7188.84] P:1870.83 E:0.094744 |  those two centre hearts are not quick
[7188.84 - 7190.84] P:1827.50 E:0.100008 |  on the turn so when England had
[7190.84 - 7192.84] P:1802.94 E:0.092884 |  the ball in and around it wasn't just the long balls
[7192.84 - 7194.84] P:1932.49 E:0.104514 |  when they had the ball
[7194.84 - 7196.84] P:1846.50 E:0.094389 |  in and around the 18 yard box
[7196.84 - 7198.84] P:1811.26 E:0.094275 |  they needed to turn the defenders
[7198.84 - 7200.84] P:1871.15 E:0.096535 |  and that's what he is brilliant at
[7200.84 - 7202.84] P:1817.82 E:0.093545 |  he's been superb at doing that this season
[7202.84 - 7204.84] P:1706.21 E:0.110135 |  and he needed to do it once
[7204.84 - 7206.84] P:1741.45 E:0.078039 |  and that once is one Englander game
[7206.84 - 7208.84] P:1620.32 E:0.106699 |  that second half
[7208.84 - 7210.84] P:1778.43 E:0.096737 |  I think was really interesting because
[7210.84 - 7212.84] P:1720.64 E:0.099292 |  the Dutch brought on Venkhorst
[7212.84 - 7214.84] P:1682.81 E:0.092617 |  and he gave
[7214.84 - 7216.84] P:1597.50 E:0.103790 |  he gave them an option
[7216.84 - 7218.84] P:1778.36 E:0.105030 |  and Watkins came on
[7218.84 - 7220.84] P:1716.42 E:0.107818 |  to give England an option as well
[7220.84 - 7222.84] P:1725.91 E:0.108710 |  but a different type of option
[7222.84 - 7224.84] P:1706.75 E:0.109220 |  yeah absolutely completely different
[7224.84 - 7226.84] P:1763.87 E:0.104936 |  and Venkhorst I have to say
[7226.84 - 7228.84] P:1785.71 E:0.113752 |  was super effective at what he did
[7228.84 - 7230.84] P:1687.77 E:0.117326 |  and the Dutch found him brilliantly
[7230.84 - 7232.84] P:1797.05 E:0.106146 |  he was a good release when the pressure was on
[7232.84 - 7234.84] P:1854.71 E:0.098070 |  and he played his part
[7234.84 - 7236.84] P:1790.90 E:0.107994 |  but the two centre backs
[7236.84 - 7238.84] P:1722.91 E:0.099682 |  the two Dutch centre backs
[7238.84 - 7240.84] P:1848.04 E:0.109663 |  they loved getting tight
[7240.84 - 7242.84] P:1766.45 E:0.099067 |  the amount of times he gambled
[7242.84 - 7244.84] P:1710.52 E:0.105258 |  to get tight and win the ball
[7244.84 - 7246.84] P:1888.93 E:0.110242 |  or a tight pressure to a player's first touch
[7246.84 - 7248.84] P:1834.67 E:0.105640 |  when they got the back to goal
[7248.84 - 7250.84] P:1894.89 E:0.108989 |  and he was in front
[7250.84 - 7252.84] P:1926.69 E:0.095715 |  when he's running back the other way
[7252.84 - 7254.84] P:1931.05 E:0.086096 |  he's not as happy at all
[7254.84 - 7256.84] P:1697.62 E:0.096372 |  and it showed in that one moment
[7256.84 - 7258.84] P:1819.85 E:0.095993 |  that Oli Watkins exposed
[7258.84 - 7260.84] P:1740.41 E:0.098393 |  it showed and at this level
[7260.84 - 7262.84] P:1807.43 E:0.093202 |  it just needs that one moment
[7262.84 - 7264.84] P:1699.29 E:0.101604 |  and took advantage of it
[7264.84 - 7266.84] P:1723.88 E:0.094051 |  it's so clinical what Watkins did
[7266.84 - 7268.84] P:1703.93 E:0.102964 |  and like Alan said
[7268.84 - 7270.84] P:1656.81 E:0.096335 |  that is his trademark in that sense
[7270.84 - 7272.84] P:1713.88 E:0.110996 |  that kind of run
[7272.84 - 7274.84] P:1660.90 E:0.102065 |  I just watched as well at Southgate
[7274.84 - 7276.84] P:1704.38 E:0.108553 |  going to John Stones
[7276.84 - 7278.84] P:1599.75 E:0.101750 |  Alan didn't he in the second half
[7278.84 - 7280.84] P:1667.40 E:0.101675 |  against Venkhorst and I thought
[7280.84 - 7282.84] P:1770.01 E:0.084915 |  they had an excellent night stones
[7282.84 - 7284.84] P:1726.90 E:0.101646 |  well I think maybe
[7284.84 - 7286.84] P:1647.68 E:0.105273 |  Alan Matt is here
[7286.84 - 7288.84] P:1763.21 E:0.112950 |  you go first Alan probably sums up the two halves
[7288.84 - 7290.84] P:1706.71 E:0.094619 |  the first half you're thinking
[7290.84 - 7292.84] P:1610.33 E:0.113086 |  well Kobe Maynard and Phil Foden
[7292.84 - 7294.84] P:1765.50 E:0.100798 |  are probably England's two
[7294.84 - 7296.84] P:1825.41 E:0.093921 |  England's two players in the match
[7296.84 - 7298.84] P:1801.67 E:0.094798 |  based on the second half
[7298.84 - 7300.84] P:1809.95 E:0.096149 |  you might go Stones actually
[7300.84 - 7302.84] P:1794.14 E:0.104122 |  two very different halves
[7302.84 - 7304.84] P:1709.74 E:0.096936 |  we said it half time about the energy
[7304.84 - 7306.84] P:1687.37 E:0.097494 |  and the confidence
[7306.84 - 7308.84] P:1710.12 E:0.100711 |  and Phil Foden getting in that 10 rolling close
[7308.84 - 7310.84] P:1706.06 E:0.091446 |  and all sorts of problems
[7310.84 - 7312.84] P:1728.90 E:0.095545 |  without doubt it was England's best 45 minutes
[7312.84 - 7314.84] P:1776.74 E:0.096979 |  but it was very different second half
[7314.84 - 7316.84] P:1674.23 E:0.114479 |  because of the change that Ronald Coombs made
[7316.84 - 7318.84] P:1701.36 E:0.099350 |  because everyone sat back
[7318.84 - 7320.84] P:1743.77 E:0.095539 |  and there was no space
[7320.84 - 7322.84] P:1708.51 E:0.100962 |  everything was congested and it was tight
[7322.84 - 7324.84] P:1581.46 E:0.101393 |  and there was a slight change to the system
[7324.84 - 7326.84] P:1818.77 E:0.090642 |  where they went forward the back
[7326.84 - 7328.84] P:1804.95 E:0.104965 |  it was a little bit of surprise
[7328.84 - 7330.84] P:1822.50 E:0.087261 |  and there's no doubt Bellion wasn't as happy
[7330.84 - 7332.84] P:1784.30 E:0.106597 |  as he was in the first half or second half
[7332.84 - 7334.84] P:1800.55 E:0.089562 |  or third without any joy
[7334.84 - 7336.84] P:1838.04 E:0.098396 |  and I was just wondering when the changes
[7336.84 - 7338.84] P:1679.04 E:0.101573 |  wouldn't happen whether it was going to be
[7338.84 - 7340.84] P:1743.97 E:0.096552 |  on 20 minutes to go, 15 minutes to go
[7340.84 - 7342.84] P:1741.52 E:0.098875 |  they had to happen the changes
[7342.84 - 7344.84] P:1641.09 E:0.098253 |  were right and the changes were perfect
[7344.84 - 7346.84] P:1543.83 E:0.098040 |  and that change was Oli Watkins
[7346.84 - 7348.84] P:1573.67 E:0.101573 |  and what a night for him and what a night for England
[7348.84 - 7350.84] P:1613.45 E:0.094523 |  I was struggling with the back
[7350.84 - 7352.84] P:1774.44 E:0.095001 |  the change of formation
[7352.84 - 7354.84] P:1673.08 E:0.081754 |  because we looked
[7354.84 - 7356.84] P:1766.88 E:0.101707 |  so fluid in that first half
[7356.84 - 7358.84] P:1763.43 E:0.102363 |  it was a brilliant performance
[7358.84 - 7360.84] P:1730.97 E:0.093082 |  so many players excelled
[7360.84 - 7362.84] P:1666.11 E:0.100619 |  and we just couldn't hit that rhythm
[7362.84 - 7364.84] P:1564.79 E:0.104869 |  with the back four and bellied him on the left
[7366.84 - 7368.84] P:1641.86 E:0.115290 |  are you alright mate?
[7368.84 - 7370.84] P:1785.20 E:0.106911 |  I'm choking up
[7370.84 - 7372.84] P:1816.18 E:0.109737 |  Chappers, can I just come in there
[7372.84 - 7374.84] P:1703.14 E:0.101351 |  we've been most animated
[7374.84 - 7376.84] P:1564.62 E:0.111077 |  I've ever seen Garos Southgate
[7376.84 - 7378.84] P:1441.10 E:0.098383 |  right in front of me
[7378.84 - 7380.84] P:1656.36 E:0.111513 |  and we'll probably see it later
[7380.84 - 7382.84] P:1604.44 E:0.117134 |  we definitely will see it later on the highlights
[7382.84 - 7384.84] P:1507.46 E:0.104136 |  but we've seen him animated
[7384.84 - 7386.84] P:1509.47 E:0.105602 |  after the previous game against Switzerland
[7386.84 - 7388.84] P:1656.03 E:0.107874 |  he's just taken up another ten notches
[7388.84 - 7390.84] P:1594.56 E:0.104357 |  because there just seemed to be
[7390.84 - 7392.84] P:1423.36 E:0.102791 |  this
[7392.84 - 7394.84] P:1664.97 E:0.105826 |  deep, deep strength within him
[7394.84 - 7396.84] P:1537.30 E:0.101828 |  and he just was fainting to the crowd
[7396.84 - 7398.84] P:1331.58 E:0.111223 |  he was a lit red in me, he said one more
[7398.84 - 7400.84] P:1728.89 E:0.101411 |  to the crowd and the crowd responded to him
[7400.84 - 7402.84] P:1842.38 E:0.091140 |  and there just seemed to be
[7402.84 - 7404.84] P:1809.61 E:0.110502 |  so much that came out of him
[7404.84 - 7406.84] P:1602.98 E:0.118302 |  within that moment and he got
[7406.84 - 7408.84] P:1836.76 E:0.100300 |  he got it spot on, he got it spot on
[7408.84 - 7410.84] P:1788.06 E:0.105688 |  because he recognised, like Ellen described
[7410.84 - 7412.84] P:1688.61 E:0.100295 |  the weakness of the Dutch centre backs
[7412.84 - 7414.84] P:1712.92 E:0.099321 |  the strength then, how do we get on top of that
[7414.84 - 7416.84] P:1583.73 E:0.101005 |  Oli Watkins, he's the man
[7416.84 - 7418.84] P:1576.08 E:0.109991 |  and what did he do, he went on
[7418.84 - 7420.84] P:1748.61 E:0.099519 |  and won the game and it didn't go to extra time
[7420.84 - 7422.84] P:1402.67 E:0.092927 |  happy days
[7422.84 - 7424.84] P:1615.49 E:0.105271 |  well, you don't blame him though, Dizzy
[7424.84 - 7426.84] P:1701.52 E:0.110615 |  is he, you don't blame
[7426.84 - 7428.84] P:1773.14 E:0.104309 |  you don't blame him
[7428.84 - 7430.84] P:1689.79 E:0.094948 |  I mean, two weeks ago
[7430.84 - 7432.84] P:1660.95 E:0.094972 |  they were throwing
[7432.84 - 7434.84] P:1703.23 E:0.086035 |  big plastic
[7434.84 - 7436.84] P:1630.57 E:0.110877 |  skips at him and so on and so forth
[7436.84 - 7438.84] P:1663.15 E:0.099538 |  they've given him stick and by the way
[7438.84 - 7440.84] P:1655.25 E:0.105346 |  that's not just a fan, that's a media thing as well
[7440.84 - 7442.84] P:1716.48 E:0.098177 |  of which role parts are some more stronger
[7442.84 - 7444.84] P:1633.87 E:0.098690 |  in their criticism of him than others
[7444.84 - 7446.84] P:1739.75 E:0.098276 |  but I don't blame him
[7446.84 - 7448.84] P:1721.87 E:0.095338 |  for giving it back, to be honest
[7448.84 - 7450.84] P:1655.61 E:0.099295 |  I'd be giving it back 10 volts to some other people
[7450.84 - 7452.84] P:1742.58 E:0.101130 |  of course
[7452.84 - 7454.84] P:1841.52 E:0.090209 |  I think I'm not sure who's giving it back, I think he was actually enjoying it
[7454.84 - 7456.84] P:1682.34 E:0.094345 |  I think and so he should do
[7456.84 - 7458.84] P:1729.39 E:0.108980 |  he's made a huge decision tonight in terms of
[7458.84 - 7460.84] P:1680.36 E:0.095600 |  the substitution and it's worked
[7460.84 - 7462.84] P:1665.50 E:0.094935 |  perfectly for him, at times yet
[7462.84 - 7464.84] P:1590.43 E:0.100136 |  he's been criticised
[7464.84 - 7466.84] P:1664.64 E:0.107482 |  and rightly so because
[7466.84 - 7468.84] P:1731.04 E:0.099890 |  England haven't performed as they could have and should have
[7468.84 - 7470.84] P:1749.12 E:0.083825 |  in that first half tonight
[7470.84 - 7472.84] P:1734.25 E:0.100276 |  I thought that was absolutely magnificent
[7472.84 - 7474.84] P:1774.43 E:0.102414 |  it was more like what we wanted
[7474.84 - 7476.84] P:1783.97 E:0.092705 |  and then the second half it had to be a different performance
[7476.84 - 7478.84] P:1828.68 E:0.091046 |  he deserves all the credit
[7478.84 - 7480.84] P:1700.93 E:0.096462 |  I've done that you can
[7480.84 - 7482.84] P:1724.46 E:0.105107 |  kind of underestimate what that pressure valve is
[7482.84 - 7484.84] P:1703.83 E:0.099994 |  at this moment in time when
[7484.84 - 7486.84] P:1784.73 E:0.089022 |  you feel a certain way
[7486.84 - 7488.84] P:1705.72 E:0.098200 |  you feel very really
[7488.84 - 7490.84] P:1665.60 E:0.113070 |  passionate or you wanted to prove something wrong and then you do it
[7490.84 - 7492.84] P:1742.87 E:0.092192 |  it's an amazing feeling
[7492.84 - 7494.84] P:1717.09 E:0.103559 |  and I think that that valve just gets open
[7494.84 - 7496.84] P:1484.20 E:0.092079 |  and then
[7496.84 - 7498.84] P:1742.26 E:0.104304 |  that comes out in terms of just relieving
[7498.84 - 7500.84] P:1831.60 E:0.091312 |  that stress and letting
[7500.84 - 7502.84] P:1793.36 E:0.096633 |  people know what you're about
[7502.84 - 7504.84] P:1737.23 E:0.101929 |  and I think he's done that Garry Salker
[7504.84 - 7506.84] P:1658.00 E:0.096154 |  certainly in this game Alan said the decisions that he's made
[7506.84 - 7508.84] P:1695.74 E:0.101193 |  how the team have settled
[7508.84 - 7510.84] P:1634.82 E:0.092484 |  and just weathered that storm
[7510.84 - 7512.84] P:1668.75 E:0.099234 |  early on in this competition
[7512.84 - 7514.84] P:1747.24 E:0.085289 |  I think is
[7514.84 - 7516.84] P:1734.04 E:0.099302 |  you have to give a lot of credit to what that is
[7516.84 - 7518.84] P:1782.59 E:0.101510 |  some lovely moments
[7518.84 - 7520.84] P:1593.90 E:0.105749 |  here at the moment because the
[7520.84 - 7522.84] P:1635.88 E:0.103128 |  England friends and family
[7522.84 - 7524.84] P:1710.74 E:0.101618 |  are just down below us
[7524.84 - 7526.84] P:1705.54 E:0.106301 |  they're above the England dugout
[7526.84 - 7528.84] P:1763.82 E:0.089539 |  which is still got
[7528.84 - 7530.84] P:1577.03 E:0.109720 |  it's still wet on the top
[7530.84 - 7532.84] P:1599.58 E:0.108323 |  I'm assuming that's from all the rain earlier
[7532.84 - 7534.84] P:1559.30 E:0.106550 |  and not from beer that's been thrown
[7534.84 - 7536.84] P:1662.58 E:0.088377 |  over the course
[7536.84 - 7538.84] P:1666.75 E:0.113439 |  of the
[7538.84 - 7540.84] P:1675.82 E:0.105116 |  90 minutes
[7540.84 - 7542.84] P:1800.36 E:0.106306 |  just on the substitutions in all of this
[7542.84 - 7544.84] P:1696.06 E:0.107896 |  Alan, is that not only was it walking
[7544.84 - 7546.84] P:1739.55 E:0.099373 |  to the finish it was Palmer with the assist
[7546.84 - 7548.84] P:1634.35 E:0.101493 |  it worked perfectly for them
[7548.84 - 7550.84] P:1783.54 E:0.100749 |  I mean those two
[7550.84 - 7552.84] P:1743.68 E:0.107548 |  as I said when you put on as a substitute
[7552.84 - 7554.84] P:1767.91 E:0.108486 |  you either put on to try and save the game
[7554.84 - 7556.84] P:1667.48 E:0.095131 |  or impact the game in a different way
[7556.84 - 7558.84] P:1518.00 E:0.101557 |  we know why
[7558.84 - 7560.84] P:1792.62 E:0.098477 |  Palmer was brought on to try and get that little bit
[7560.84 - 7562.84] P:1605.46 E:0.102742 |  of quality on the ball which we
[7562.84 - 7564.84] P:1720.04 E:0.091976 |  couldn't find in the second half
[7564.84 - 7566.84] P:1605.21 E:0.104420 |  but we also know why Watkins
[7566.84 - 7568.84] P:1704.38 E:0.089575 |  was brought on to upset the defenders
[7568.84 - 7570.84] P:1531.39 E:0.103245 |  to run behind the defenders
[7570.84 - 7572.84] P:1809.39 E:0.105842 |  making use of himself and when he got a chance
[7572.84 - 7574.84] P:1661.64 E:0.096331 |  to put it away he couldn't get any better than that does it
[7574.84 - 7576.84] P:1588.22 E:0.103757 |  these are special moments
[7576.84 - 7578.84] P:1473.12 E:0.111271 |  for these England players and the England staff
[7578.84 - 7580.84] P:1647.66 E:0.104498 |  as well they're not really
[7580.84 - 7582.84] P:1615.61 E:0.095889 |  wanted to leave in front of the dugout
[7582.84 - 7584.84] P:1504.53 E:0.107365 |  with all their family and friends down below us
[7584.84 - 7586.84] P:1613.00 E:0.108355 |  and then what will happen now
[7586.84 - 7588.84] P:1483.50 E:0.103509 |  is that some of those
[7588.84 - 7590.84] P:1660.39 E:0.112049 |  the players will try and go into the tunnel
[7590.84 - 7592.84] P:1452.45 E:0.104635 |  the staff will as well
[7592.84 - 7594.84] P:1522.12 E:0.106226 |  and they'll want the ground just to quiet
[7594.84 - 7596.84] P:1590.27 E:0.113792 |  in a little bit and then they'll be able to come out
[7596.84 - 7598.84] P:1530.89 E:0.099405 |  and spend some time
[7598.84 - 7600.84] P:1552.17 E:0.098789 |  with their family and friends
[7600.84 - 7602.84] P:1427.28 E:0.105550 |  although I would say
[7602.84 - 7604.84] P:1669.00 E:0.105438 |  given by what's going on behind Izzy at the moment
[7604.84 - 7606.84] P:1660.56 E:0.103439 |  the fans aren't leaving the ground
[7606.84 - 7608.84] P:1630.77 E:0.105860 |  for the moment let's go down to the tunnel
[7608.84 - 7610.84] P:1612.26 E:0.103729 |  Gary Flint off what's going on down there
[7610.84 - 7612.84] P:1645.19 E:0.102767 |  a real contrast down here Mark
[7612.84 - 7614.84] P:1603.80 E:0.105838 |  we've got the England players coming in
[7614.84 - 7616.84] P:1500.71 E:0.115767 |  I mean literally they can hardly believe
[7616.84 - 7618.84] P:1502.11 E:0.108576 |  that they've managed to win this game
[7618.84 - 7620.84] P:1394.54 E:0.108577 |  right at the end actually
[7620.84 - 7622.84] P:1767.76 E:0.108022 |  said by Song who's obviously done a bit of work
[7622.84 - 7624.84] P:1556.60 E:0.109647 |  on five lives over the years just giving
[7624.84 - 7626.84] P:1705.84 E:0.100774 |  Kyle Walker a huge bear hook
[7626.84 - 7628.84] P:1573.47 E:0.098933 |  and a big hug for Harry Kane as well
[7628.84 - 7630.84] P:1674.97 E:0.102108 |  but on the other side just saw
[7630.84 - 7632.84] P:1537.75 E:0.106179 |  Virgil van Dijk come through
[7632.84 - 7634.84] P:1624.10 E:0.094658 |  basically his head in his shirt
[7634.84 - 7636.84] P:1703.24 E:0.110806 |  and I think it's safe to say
[7636.84 - 7638.84] P:1612.52 E:0.098299 |  the majority of those Dutch players
[7638.84 - 7640.84] P:1644.34 E:0.103428 |  are absolutely shell shocked
[7640.84 - 7642.84] P:1666.88 E:0.100328 |  they can't believe it
[7642.84 - 7644.84] P:1579.33 E:0.093298 |  they thought it was going to extra time
[7644.84 - 7646.84] P:1547.64 E:0.101268 |  and yet are they Watkins?
[7646.84 - 7648.84] P:1559.48 E:0.094770 |  and the answer for England
[7648.84 - 7650.84] P:1612.01 E:0.096644 |  well look I think we have to be
[7650.84 - 7652.84] P:1513.99 E:0.106600 |  brutally honest as well here
[7652.84 - 7654.84] P:1697.67 E:0.106651 |  for all the celebration and all the joy
[7654.84 - 7656.84] P:1720.34 E:0.107346 |  if we were doing Dutch radio tonight
[7656.84 - 7658.84] P:1599.72 E:0.105563 |  we would be going straight in
[7658.84 - 7660.84] P:1504.70 E:0.097803 |  on the referee wouldn't we
[7660.84 - 7662.84] P:1657.06 E:0.107104 |  certainly for me and he was awful
[7662.84 - 7664.84] P:1656.38 E:0.105483 |  from that point of view I mean
[7664.84 - 7666.84] P:1726.32 E:0.103255 |  certainly towards the end there was a couple of really
[7666.84 - 7668.84] P:1679.55 E:0.104584 |  dubious free kicks that he gave
[7668.84 - 7670.84] P:1540.43 E:0.103945 |  he actually broke up the play
[7670.84 - 7672.84] P:1750.29 E:0.096818 |  or broke up the Dutch winning the ball back
[7672.84 - 7674.84] P:1573.60 E:0.088888 |  and then attacking but
[7674.84 - 7676.84] P:1595.42 E:0.105469 |  I mean the huge talking point is the penalty
[7676.84 - 7678.84] P:1718.41 E:0.088921 |  I just think
[7678.84 - 7680.84] P:1715.12 E:0.092571 |  Dumfries is so hard done by
[7680.84 - 7682.84] P:1741.33 E:0.094331 |  he doesn't actually
[7682.84 - 7684.84] P:1647.58 E:0.098589 |  kick out into the challenge
[7684.84 - 7686.84] P:1594.58 E:0.098644 |  he just puts his foot up and
[7686.84 - 7688.84] P:1698.93 E:0.089547 |  Kane kicks through
[7688.84 - 7690.84] P:1728.42 E:0.103107 |  for me it shouldn't go to the VAR review
[7690.84 - 7692.84] P:1520.63 E:0.107281 |  and it should just be the on field decision
[7692.84 - 7694.84] P:1771.95 E:0.093765 |  I thought it was a real poor use
[7694.84 - 7696.84] P:1811.75 E:0.092847 |  of VAR
[7696.84 - 7698.84] P:1638.76 E:0.093124 |  I'm a Dutch player
[7698.84 - 7700.84] P:1632.15 E:0.099721 |  I'm Ronald Koeman then I'm absolutely
[7700.84 - 7702.84] P:1508.75 E:0.115544 |  seated if you remember when they brought it out
[7702.84 - 7704.84] P:1724.84 E:0.087257 |  they told it was sort of blinding obvious
[7704.84 - 7706.84] P:1500.52 E:0.095647 |  and they're not going to re-referee games
[7706.84 - 7708.84] P:1613.34 E:0.101973 |  that for me was a classic way
[7708.84 - 7710.84] P:1565.43 E:0.096874 |  of re-referring it the referee
[7710.84 - 7712.84] P:1720.43 E:0.089403 |  didn't give anything on the pitch
[7712.84 - 7714.84] P:1716.34 E:0.095950 |  he didn't think it was a penalty
[7714.84 - 7716.84] P:1611.72 E:0.107595 |  I didn't think it was a penalty so then for him to be sent
[7716.84 - 7718.84] P:1701.38 E:0.101314 |  there and overturn it I was really surprised
[7718.84 - 7720.84] P:1518.01 E:0.093262 |  I didn't even see it was being checked
[7720.84 - 7722.84] P:1690.56 E:0.103884 |  to be honest I didn't see it come up on the screen
[7722.84 - 7724.84] P:1524.81 E:0.100292 |  and I didn't assume there was either
[7724.84 - 7726.84] P:1450.95 E:0.080677 |  the other thing that you would say on that though
[7726.84 - 7728.84] P:1727.04 E:0.105973 |  I don't know if you felt it down there
[7728.84 - 7730.84] P:1668.56 E:0.106862 |  is he pitch side
[7730.84 - 7732.84] P:1579.55 E:0.086153 |  is that they allowed themselves to get
[7732.84 - 7734.84] P:1626.93 E:0.110731 |  wound up by those decisions
[7734.84 - 7736.84] P:1614.65 E:0.094716 |  and it's very easy for me to say sitting
[7736.84 - 7738.84] P:1624.87 E:0.104587 |  in the stand
[7738.84 - 7740.84] P:1588.93 E:0.084536 |  but maybe they could have done with the calm
[7740.84 - 7742.84] P:1572.37 E:0.101643 |  head or two in that last ten minutes
[7742.84 - 7744.84] P:1640.63 E:0.102581 |  the Dutch
[7744.84 - 7746.84] P:1606.65 E:0.091033 |  yes yeah you're right
[7746.84 - 7748.84] P:1838.28 E:0.098384 |  absolutely but I think
[7748.84 - 7750.84] P:1742.52 E:0.108202 |  they've got reasons to feel aggrieved because
[7750.84 - 7752.84] P:1510.30 E:0.109522 |  there was a few little challenges where
[7752.84 - 7754.84] P:1700.64 E:0.101378 |  I think it was Codegapo down on that right hand side
[7754.84 - 7756.84] P:1675.70 E:0.097347 |  in the second half
[7756.84 - 7758.84] P:1624.19 E:0.094880 |  he just nicked the ball
[7758.84 - 7760.84] P:1709.62 E:0.105338 |  I think Coby Maynou
[7760.84 - 7762.84] P:1725.59 E:0.104104 |  and he was away and then the referee pulled it back
[7762.84 - 7764.84] P:1762.55 E:0.086975 |  for a free kick
[7764.84 - 7766.84] P:1606.85 E:0.109691 |  and you know the England fans here are not complaining one little bit
[7766.84 - 7768.84] P:1605.65 E:0.094501 |  but that's another reason
[7768.84 - 7770.84] P:1603.53 E:0.104218 |  why the Dutch can feel that way
[7770.84 - 7772.84] P:1715.47 E:0.099677 |  and they'll definitely be going home
[7772.84 - 7774.84] P:1713.52 E:0.108171 |  you know feeling like they were hard
[7774.84 - 7776.84] P:1665.95 E:0.092918 |  done by but that's the
[7776.84 - 7778.84] P:1663.39 E:0.102026 |  presence of England and sometimes that happens
[7778.84 - 7780.84] P:1804.18 E:0.099032 |  and England in the end
[7780.84 - 7782.84] P:1718.42 E:0.100495 |  they played some fantastic football in the first half
[7782.84 - 7784.84] P:1558.69 E:0.106137 |  but we've got to remember
[7784.84 - 7786.84] P:1473.62 E:0.111819 |  we were drawing one all at half time
[7786.84 - 7788.84] P:1737.31 E:0.098270 |  and then it's actually the second half
[7788.84 - 7790.84] P:1675.39 E:0.100385 |  when they didn't play as well
[7790.84 - 7792.84] P:1572.76 E:0.106904 |  England but then we went on and won the game
[7792.84 - 7794.84] P:1711.97 E:0.097495 |  so it's just funny how things work
[7794.84 - 7796.84] P:1796.11 E:0.099616 |  but this team is in a fantastic position now
[7796.84 - 7798.84] P:1699.30 E:0.074785 |  to go and play Spain
[7798.84 - 7800.84] P:1716.11 E:0.114497 |  we will I'm sure
[7800.84 - 7802.84] P:1563.13 E:0.098842 |  look ahead to that final
[7802.84 - 7804.84] P:1576.65 E:0.103845 |  this evening I think we're going to spend a lot of the next few days
[7804.84 - 7806.84] P:1658.84 E:0.108585 |  looking ahead to that final as well
[7806.84 - 7808.84] P:1576.19 E:0.111202 |  let's hear from the player of the match
[7808.84 - 7810.84] P:1674.51 E:0.095029 |  let the winning goal scorer
[7810.84 - 7812.84] P:1749.11 E:0.099026 |  Oli Watkins and in his
[7812.84 - 7814.84] P:1758.19 E:0.094919 |  player of the match interview with Gabriel Clark
[7814.84 - 7816.84] P:1591.58 E:0.091342 |  unbelievable I've been waiting for that moment
[7816.84 - 7818.84] P:1388.92 E:0.079628 |  for weeks
[7818.84 - 7820.84] P:1618.80 E:0.085318 |  you know it's taken a lot of hard work to get
[7820.84 - 7822.84] P:1409.32 E:0.089679 |  to where I am today and
[7822.84 - 7824.84] P:1592.71 E:0.097725 |  grateful that I got the opportunity
[7824.84 - 7826.84] P:1515.64 E:0.085572 |  and I grabbed it with both hands and
[7826.84 - 7828.84] P:1454.26 E:0.087654 |  I'm delighted
[7828.84 - 7830.84] P:1615.95 E:0.086249 |  talk us through the goal
[7832.84 - 7834.84] P:1508.95 E:0.090052 |  I swear on my life my kids life
[7834.84 - 7836.84] P:1533.07 E:0.081453 |  I said to Cole Palmer
[7836.84 - 7838.84] P:1487.50 E:0.071662 |  we're coming on today
[7838.84 - 7840.84] P:1412.01 E:0.079372 |  and you're going to set me up
[7840.84 - 7842.84] P:1474.33 E:0.083753 |  and that's why I was so happy with Cole
[7842.84 - 7844.84] P:1728.53 E:0.100314 |  I knew as soon as he got the ball
[7844.84 - 7846.84] P:1581.31 E:0.079720 |  he was going to play me and you got to be greedy
[7846.84 - 7848.84] P:1608.65 E:0.085274 |  touch and finish and when I've seen it
[7848.84 - 7850.84] P:1425.00 E:0.093181 |  go in the bottom corner
[7850.84 - 7852.84] P:1632.64 E:0.096275 |  it's the best feeling ever
[7852.84 - 7854.84] P:1721.91 E:0.091821 |  and the manager's had a bit of criticism
[7854.84 - 7856.84] P:1509.02 E:0.080779 |  for not making substitutions early enough
[7856.84 - 7858.84] P:1431.56 E:0.081091 |  he's got it dead right tonight
[7858.84 - 7860.84] P:1685.84 E:0.086789 |  look there's been a lot of criticism
[7860.84 - 7862.84] P:1515.74 E:0.078827 |  but at the end of the day we're in the final
[7862.84 - 7864.84] P:1447.77 E:0.085863 |  and that's all that matters
[7864.84 - 7866.84] P:1443.66 E:0.076979 |  we're in the final
[7866.84 - 7868.84] P:1743.72 E:0.093550 |  and to sum it up for this team now
[7868.84 - 7870.84] P:1622.57 E:0.076577 |  you've seen last minute
[7870.84 - 7872.84] P:1637.82 E:0.080186 |  overhead kick equalises, penalties
[7872.84 - 7874.84] P:1689.97 E:0.086834 |  a last minute winner tonight
[7874.84 - 7876.84] P:1739.84 E:0.082928 |  something feels special here
[7876.84 - 7878.84] P:1643.83 E:0.088738 |  yeah exactly we've got that kind of
[7878.84 - 7880.84] P:1621.88 E:0.087271 |  bounce back factor you know going to go
[7880.84 - 7882.84] P:1656.16 E:0.081506 |  behind but we seem to it seems to kick us
[7882.84 - 7884.84] P:1503.39 E:0.089581 |  into gear and we never give up
[7884.84 - 7886.84] P:1399.97 E:0.083873 |  and we've won on penalties
[7886.84 - 7888.84] P:1372.47 E:0.090804 |  we've come from behind
[7888.84 - 7890.84] P:1514.28 E:0.082339 |  yeah one more game now
[7890.84 - 7892.84] P:1437.43 E:0.080382 |  one more game
[7892.84 - 7894.84] P:1568.52 E:0.084795 |  yeah ready
[7894.84 - 7896.84] P:1612.95 E:0.111041 |  maybe let him celebrate
[7896.84 - 7898.84] P:1634.68 E:0.101574 |  first of all the lines are open
[7898.84 - 7900.84] P:1757.25 E:0.099124 |  4-6-0-6
[7900.84 - 7902.84] P:1582.98 E:0.114370 |  Chris and Robbie on the way
[7902.84 - 7904.84] P:1730.73 E:0.110087 |  0-8-0-8-5-9-0-9-6-9-3
[7908.84 - 7910.84] P:1759.68 E:0.110031 |  I like Holly Watkins predictions there
[7910.84 - 7912.84] P:1688.08 E:0.089991 |  Matt Upsson
[7912.84 - 7914.84] P:1668.65 E:0.103912 |  the confidence
[7914.84 - 7916.84] P:1802.08 E:0.100365 |  but that's what we've seen I suppose during this tournament
[7916.84 - 7918.84] P:1666.94 E:0.095009 |  haven't we?
[7918.84 - 7920.84] P:1504.79 E:0.096660 |  we've seen England's subs
[7920.84 - 7922.84] P:1711.06 E:0.104846 |  come on and change the game
[7922.84 - 7924.84] P:1687.53 E:0.089701 |  I'll be honest I think one of the big things about this group is
[7924.84 - 7926.84] P:1714.20 E:0.097386 |  I think we've got a real
[7926.84 - 7928.84] P:1648.96 E:0.096885 |  a bit of a cocky arrogance about us
[7928.84 - 7930.84] P:1722.50 E:0.084000 |  in a good way
[7930.84 - 7932.84] P:1792.36 E:0.096297 |  not too much but you
[7932.84 - 7934.84] P:1701.40 E:0.097218 |  can't surmise back to the game against the French
[7934.84 - 7936.84] P:1494.86 E:0.104093 |  in the World Cup
[7936.84 - 7938.84] P:1590.85 E:0.107181 |  and that arrogance and belief that they feel they're better
[7938.84 - 7940.84] P:1693.78 E:0.093781 |  and that they can win
[7940.84 - 7942.84] P:1598.00 E:0.092540 |  I think this group has just kind of developed that
[7942.84 - 7944.84] P:1551.84 E:0.098514 |  over the last 18 months
[7944.84 - 7946.84] P:1778.11 E:0.086509 |  we've got a few individuals that are exceeding
[7946.84 - 7948.84] P:1901.96 E:0.096720 |  you know huge levels of
[7948.84 - 7950.84] P:1780.46 E:0.094009 |  performance in top teams across the world
[7950.84 - 7952.84] P:1861.05 E:0.098577 |  and across the board
[7952.84 - 7954.84] P:1723.07 E:0.086988 |  I think we are really confident
[7954.84 - 7956.84] P:1766.49 E:0.095566 |  as a group and it shows in the penalties
[7956.84 - 7958.84] P:1823.68 E:0.084908 |  and it shows in moments like that
[7958.84 - 7960.84] P:1663.37 E:0.097205 |  where we're just doing the right things
[7960.84 - 7962.84] P:1836.22 E:0.085304 |  hitting the right note at the right time
[7962.84 - 7964.84] P:1758.43 E:0.083894 |  in massive moments in games
[7964.84 - 7966.84] P:1828.60 E:0.082077 |  and if you're going to do that
[7966.84 - 7968.84] P:1841.60 E:0.088993 |  and you play well and you've got the players
[7968.84 - 7970.84] P:1758.97 E:0.090598 |  you've got a great chance of winning this thing
[7970.84 - 7972.84] P:1772.29 E:0.075559 |  Alan
[7972.84 - 7974.84] P:1928.03 E:0.107786 |  I feel drained
[7974.84 - 7976.84] P:1862.43 E:0.102423 |  I feel as if I've been out there myself
[7976.84 - 7978.84] P:1817.16 E:0.093098 |  it's a great night
[7978.84 - 7980.84] P:1743.86 E:0.083895 |  I mean at times you know
[7980.84 - 7982.84] P:1882.99 E:0.088377 |  we have to suffer international football
[7982.84 - 7984.84] P:1784.40 E:0.097714 |  it's not ever going to be easy
[7984.84 - 7986.84] P:1917.99 E:0.082596 |  I thought we really dominated the first half
[7986.84 - 7988.84] P:1812.60 E:0.092026 |  particularly after they scored
[7988.84 - 7990.84] P:1907.54 E:0.079815 |  it was a great response they upped their game
[7990.84 - 7992.84] P:1802.43 E:0.083338 |  they passed it in that great energy as I said
[7992.84 - 7994.84] P:1904.17 E:0.111355 |  and then the second half when it got really really tough
[7994.84 - 7996.84] P:1866.71 E:0.060886 |  they had to come up
[7996.84 - 7998.84] P:1878.83 E:0.088469 |  with different answers and they had to defend
[7998.84 - 8000.84] P:1897.00 E:0.088260 |  really well and they had to find a way
[8000.84 - 8002.84] P:1921.72 E:0.084038 |  again and this team
[8002.84 - 8004.84] P:1766.77 E:0.087275 |  has done that without playing spectacular
[8004.84 - 8006.84] P:1827.91 E:0.097414 |  football for four or five of the games
[8006.84 - 8008.84] P:1942.30 E:0.075359 |  they've just done enough
[8008.84 - 8010.84] P:1827.68 E:0.099667 |  when it really really mattered and they're into the final
[8010.84 - 8012.84] P:1879.72 E:0.096997 |  and they've got an incredible chance
[8012.84 - 8014.84] P:1729.81 E:0.083176 |  of winning it
[8014.84 - 8016.84] P:1764.85 E:0.102748 |  tonight for England to celebrate Izzy
[8016.84 - 8018.84] P:1750.40 E:0.102338 |  over the course of
[8018.84 - 8020.84] P:1741.16 E:0.099997 |  the next few days there will be
[8020.84 - 8022.84] P:1578.20 E:0.091063 |  obviously so much preview
[8022.84 - 8024.84] P:1614.92 E:0.112510 |  of the final against Spain which is a nine o'clock
[8024.84 - 8026.84] P:1525.21 E:0.105430 |  kickoff local time in Berlin
[8026.84 - 8028.84] P:1604.11 E:0.107209 |  eight o'clock in the UK
[8028.84 - 8030.84] P:1688.53 E:0.104937 |  we'll have all the build up full commentary course here on 5 Live
[8030.84 - 8032.84] P:1747.39 E:0.097316 |  watch it on BBC television as well
[8032.84 - 8034.84] P:1713.32 E:0.100729 |  and there will be a lot of analysis
[8034.84 - 8036.84] P:1615.77 E:0.102830 |  of England first half
[8036.84 - 8038.84] P:1470.19 E:0.095409 |  England second half
[8038.84 - 8040.84] P:1525.25 E:0.106408 |  and also of other games in this tournament
[8040.84 - 8042.84] P:1629.68 E:0.107824 |  where maybe they've gone off well and then dropped back a bit
[8042.84 - 8044.84] P:1645.74 E:0.078439 |  for that analysis
[8044.84 - 8046.84] P:1541.87 E:0.098810 |  to be fully in depth
[8046.84 - 8048.84] P:1766.63 E:0.097216 |  and fully fair tonight
[8048.84 - 8050.84] P:1787.66 E:0.081965 |  do you actually have to give the Dutch
[8050.84 - 8052.84] P:1676.60 E:0.088082 |  credit and Ronald Koeman credit
[8052.84 - 8054.84] P:1686.37 E:0.100938 |  for how he changed things as well
[8054.84 - 8056.84] P:1637.88 E:0.096634 |  it's not just a one way street is it
[8056.84 - 8058.84] P:1617.86 E:0.100722 |  no it's not and I think the first half
[8058.84 - 8060.84] P:1582.35 E:0.087582 |  we spoke about it before the game didn't we
[8060.84 - 8062.84] P:1581.75 E:0.096083 |  and we've got a lot of build up about
[8062.84 - 8064.84] P:1729.33 E:0.096070 |  the way that the Netherlands plays probably
[8064.84 - 8066.84] P:1735.01 E:0.086893 |  actually going to bring the best out of England
[8066.84 - 8068.84] P:1683.28 E:0.105035 |  because they went for it and I think one of the key moments
[8068.84 - 8070.84] P:1789.80 E:0.097140 |  in the match was Memphis Copaigo
[8070.84 - 8072.84] P:1839.02 E:0.092215 |  and off injured and it forced the Dutch
[8072.84 - 8074.84] P:1767.38 E:0.095905 |  to change their shape a little bit
[8074.84 - 8076.84] P:1650.51 E:0.094595 |  they'd obviously addressed that at half time
[8076.84 - 8078.84] P:1736.84 E:0.107080 |  brought on Valtveggors to
[8078.84 - 8080.84] P:1852.15 E:0.092221 |  essentially they looked like a 4-4-2 from where I'm sat
[8080.84 - 8082.84] P:1758.10 E:0.098457 |  and then just dropped off because
[8082.84 - 8084.84] P:1781.80 E:0.084827 |  previous teams in the tournament have had a success
[8084.84 - 8086.84] P:1783.97 E:0.096502 |  playing 4-4-2 against England
[8086.84 - 8088.84] P:1766.60 E:0.096352 |  they've completely slowed down England's rhythm
[8088.84 - 8090.84] P:1624.16 E:0.100071 |  and they're passing and frustrated us
[8090.84 - 8092.84] P:1664.62 E:0.098929 |  but what we did was we responded to that
[8092.84 - 8094.84] P:1482.26 E:0.090223 |  and I think the previous experiences of
[8094.84 - 8096.84] P:1676.13 E:0.109531 |  playing through this tournament
[8096.84 - 8098.84] P:1704.57 E:0.078499 |  against a 4-4-2
[8098.84 - 8100.84] P:1821.46 E:0.108857 |  actually helped England in that second half
[8100.84 - 8102.84] P:1751.61 E:0.093765 |  because all we needed was a moment
[8102.84 - 8104.84] P:1804.54 E:0.092680 |  and that happened because of the intelligence
[8104.84 - 8106.84] P:1655.05 E:0.098585 |  of the substitutes that came on
[8106.84 - 8108.84] P:1665.30 E:0.107141 |  and then the impact that they made
[8108.84 - 8110.84] P:1717.40 E:0.089548 |  so it's going to be a completely different
[8110.84 - 8112.84] P:1670.63 E:0.090790 |  ball game against Spain
[8112.84 - 8114.84] P:1594.37 E:0.095138 |  and of course we're not going to go into that now
[8114.84 - 8116.84] P:1720.27 E:0.089486 |  there'll be loads obviously like you say Chappers
[8116.84 - 8118.84] P:1921.00 E:0.086031 |  because Spain's at the ball
[8118.84 - 8120.84] P:1721.29 E:0.092301 |  England might perform at the same level
[8120.84 - 8122.84] P:1557.97 E:0.095460 |  that they did in the first half tonight
[8122.84 - 8124.84] P:1509.80 E:0.088555 |  which is really exciting for the England fans
[8124.84 - 8126.84] P:1601.36 E:0.106707 |  Olly Watkins winner
[8126.84 - 8128.84] P:1760.62 E:0.074797 |  was timed at
[8128.84 - 8130.84] P:1574.12 E:0.086869 |  89 minutes
[8130.84 - 8132.84] P:1536.66 E:0.091546 |  and 59 seconds
[8132.84 - 8134.84] P:1739.44 E:0.094488 |  which is the latest women's
[8134.84 - 8136.84] P:1702.87 E:0.097114 |  goal scored in a semi-finals
[8136.84 - 8138.84] P:1693.79 E:0.096372 |  at the Euros
[8138.84 - 8140.84] P:1742.47 E:0.090930 |  at all World Cup
[8140.84 - 8142.84] P:1512.61 E:0.097870 |  apparently excluding
[8142.84 - 8144.84] P:1636.19 E:0.083017 |  extra time
[8144.84 - 8146.84] P:1669.27 E:0.110353 |  but it was also England's only shot on target
[8146.84 - 8148.84] P:1483.75 E:0.095401 |  in the second half of this match
[8148.84 - 8150.84] P:1628.68 E:0.092665 |  I mean there might not have been brilliant performances
[8150.84 - 8152.84] P:1428.49 E:0.092918 |  in this but we've had drama
[8152.84 - 8154.84] P:1725.29 E:0.087636 |  haven't we? We can't deny that
[8154.84 - 8156.84] P:1658.79 E:0.095606 |  I mean back to Bellingham's overhead kick
[8156.84 - 8158.84] P:1450.74 E:0.091692 |  penalties that goal
[8158.84 - 8160.84] P:1579.23 E:0.085368 |  it just feels
[8160.84 - 8162.84] P:1584.73 E:0.090288 |  like it's going to be the time
[8162.84 - 8164.84] P:1576.12 E:0.105389 |  I'm going to say it's got that feeling
[8164.84 - 8166.84] P:1541.35 E:0.081983 |  like it's going to happen
[8166.84 - 8168.84] P:1630.97 E:0.094534 |  Naebon the trophy
[8168.84 - 8170.84] P:1845.47 E:0.095871 |  that's how it feels it just
[8170.84 - 8172.84] P:1848.28 E:0.103452 |  I can't explain why
[8172.84 - 8174.84] P:1653.11 E:0.069054 |  when England come
[8174.84 - 8176.84] P:1523.28 E:0.120941 |  would you be as a player
[8176.84 - 8178.84] P:1685.80 E:0.078779 |  and all the superstitions that you have and everything
[8178.84 - 8180.84] P:1599.63 E:0.104620 |  would you be thinking name on the trophy?
[8180.84 - 8182.84] P:1563.24 E:0.091298 |  If I would been through what these players
[8182.84 - 8184.84] P:1664.22 E:0.091849 |  have been through together
[8184.84 - 8186.84] P:1668.28 E:0.086089 |  and come to this point and still be standing
[8186.84 - 8188.84] P:1674.93 E:0.072911 |  absolutely
[8188.84 - 8190.84] P:1749.03 E:0.099308 |  I would because they should
[8190.84 - 8192.84] P:1603.79 E:0.100168 |  and then you're still an England player
[8192.84 - 8194.84] P:1755.45 E:0.113969 |  and someone looks like me interviews you
[8194.84 - 8196.84] P:1755.20 E:0.098373 |  in the billboard to the final says
[8196.84 - 8198.84] P:1687.64 E:0.086342 |  so much you get the names of the trophy
[8198.84 - 8200.84] P:1748.24 E:0.105531 |  Yeah, love that question don't you?
[8200.84 - 8202.84] P:1642.66 E:0.096295 |  I don't get that question from
[8202.84 - 8204.84] P:1763.29 E:0.098925 |  from numbs like you
[8204.84 - 8206.84] P:1861.39 E:0.068365 |  but it just feels
[8206.84 - 8208.84] P:1744.67 E:0.101445 |  right at every moment they've been doubted
[8208.84 - 8210.84] P:1551.92 E:0.099027 |  it's just a great story
[8210.84 - 8212.84] P:1652.70 E:0.077912 |  to this point and
[8212.84 - 8214.84] P:1723.82 E:0.104455 |  why shouldn't it go on?
[8214.84 - 8216.84] P:1750.04 E:0.104623 |  A new lot will happen at media than I
[8216.84 - 8218.84] P:1711.25 E:0.101294 |  saying settle down when I said this post game
[8218.84 - 8220.84] P:1857.50 E:0.101392 |  Whoa
[8220.84 - 8222.84] P:1918.89 E:0.061319 |  Come on
[8222.84 - 8224.84] P:1793.65 E:0.107667 |  Well
[8224.84 - 8226.84] P:1707.68 E:0.119307 |  I don't remember that
[8226.84 - 8228.84] P:1972.25 E:0.085263 |  As I often
[8228.84 - 8230.84] P:1899.78 E:0.094387 |  I don't remember
[8230.84 - 8232.84] P:1716.27 E:0.105618 |  John was definitely laughing at you
[8232.84 - 8234.84] P:1770.40 E:0.102851 |  absolutely laughing at you
[8234.84 - 8236.84] P:1831.08 E:0.106298 |  he's not here to defend himself
[8236.84 - 8238.84] P:1818.00 E:0.101129 |  so we'll have a go at John
[8238.84 - 8240.84] P:1685.92 E:0.094044 |  and I'll wait, I'll wait 5, 9, 9, 6, I'll
[8240.84 - 8242.84] P:1738.99 E:0.104556 |  3 if you want to get in touch
[8242.84 - 8244.84] P:1619.30 E:0.101507 |  and here is John now
[8244.84 - 8246.84] P:1439.67 E:0.099782 |  he won't defend himself
[8246.84 - 8248.84] P:1610.15 E:0.095039 |  instead he'll talk to Kobe Manu
[8248.84 - 8250.84] P:1450.32 E:0.106936 |  Yes, I won't do that in front of
[8250.84 - 8252.84] P:1575.99 E:0.100085 |  Kobe Manu who's part of an England
[8252.84 - 8254.84] P:1363.34 E:0.087765 |  team that has reached a final
[8254.84 - 8256.84] P:1541.95 E:0.081559 |  on foreign soil for the first time
[8256.84 - 8258.84] P:1455.61 E:0.101006 |  it's an undescribable feeling
[8258.84 - 8260.84] P:1254.38 E:0.098490 |  we're all buzzing
[8260.84 - 8262.84] P:1476.92 E:0.095207 |  it's been such a journey to get here
[8262.84 - 8264.84] P:1446.42 E:0.095430 |  I feel like we've built on all the performances
[8264.84 - 8266.84] P:1500.85 E:0.097529 |  that we've had leading to this point
[8266.84 - 8268.84] P:1518.45 E:0.085549 |  and I feel like the only way is up
[8268.84 - 8270.84] P:1502.63 E:0.086379 |  time to put ourselves into history
[8270.84 - 8272.84] P:1768.19 E:0.064479 |  Feel the first half performance was the best you've shown yet
[8272.84 - 8274.84] P:1628.80 E:0.093115 |  Yeah, I feel like in the first half
[8274.84 - 8276.84] P:1457.97 E:0.086664 |  it was clicking with the whole team
[8276.84 - 8278.84] P:1670.11 E:0.081962 |  everyone was getting on the ball, me, Phil, Decker, Jude
[8278.84 - 8280.84] P:1212.40 E:0.104840 |  we had to feel like we had the game under control
[8280.84 - 8282.84] P:1464.66 E:0.088493 |  in the middle of the park
[8282.84 - 8284.84] P:1706.02 E:0.115200 |  and I feel like the second half we just had to grind out
[8284.84 - 8286.84] P:1611.14 E:0.075056 |  it was tough, but the whole squad was a help
[8286.84 - 8288.84] P:1397.06 E:0.088893 |  the impact of the bench room
[8288.84 - 8290.84] P:1577.16 E:0.089418 |  Cole and Oli, I mean what a finish
[8290.84 - 8292.84] P:1684.67 E:0.102496 |  what a way to end it, so we're just buzzing
[8292.84 - 8294.84] P:1551.14 E:0.089748 |  Yeah, that finish from Oli Watkins
[8294.84 - 8296.84] P:1436.53 E:0.082674 |  that was the man
[8296.84 - 8298.84] P:1535.71 E:0.094681 |  who causes havoc at Aston Villa, wasn't it?
[8298.84 - 8300.84] P:1428.91 E:0.078752 |  Yeah, 100%
[8300.84 - 8302.84] P:1521.77 E:0.100928 |  we've seen what we've done in the season this season
[8302.84 - 8304.84] P:1315.12 E:0.084575 |  so it was
[8304.84 - 8306.84] P:1324.74 E:0.087308 |  the time was coming for him to score like that
[8306.84 - 8308.84] P:1600.53 E:0.095005 |  I knew I could feel it
[8308.84 - 8310.84] P:1492.03 E:0.086138 |  and he did that
[8310.84 - 8312.84] P:1348.39 E:0.091184 |  Kobe, it seems like five minutes
[8312.84 - 8314.84] P:1136.58 E:0.089497 |  sitting down with you in March
[8314.84 - 8316.84] P:1236.72 E:0.095479 |  where you had been
[8316.84 - 8318.84] P:1205.83 E:0.106696 |  catapulted into the senior squad
[8318.84 - 8320.84] P:979.34 E:0.089485 |  and here we are now
[8320.84 - 8322.84] P:1515.28 E:0.098530 |  Yeah, it's happened quick, but
[8322.84 - 8324.84] P:1716.07 E:0.100078 |  I've just been taking it day by day, game by game
[8324.84 - 8326.84] P:1354.64 E:0.087403 |  and
[8326.84 - 8328.84] P:1566.18 E:0.123568 |  now we're in the European Championship Final
[8328.84 - 8330.84] P:1163.73 E:0.086975 |  so, yeah, buzzing, buzzing
[8330.84 - 8332.84] P:1541.97 E:0.088128 |  What about taking on that Spanish team?
[8332.84 - 8334.84] P:1496.96 E:0.107822 |  Yeah, you know, everyone's seen they're a good side
[8334.84 - 8336.84] P:1244.35 E:0.093747 |  taking on some big teams
[8336.84 - 8338.84] P:1538.51 E:0.100768 |  but we'll be ready for that
[8338.84 - 8340.84] P:1744.32 E:0.078099 |  I feel like we're built up so much now
[8340.84 - 8342.84] P:1060.16 E:0.105819 |  building on the performances and now
[8342.84 - 8344.84] P:1310.46 E:0.082568 |  we're going to be ready for that and give it everything
[8344.84 - 8346.84] P:1373.73 E:0.088063 |  Listen off you go and enjoy it, thanks Kobe
[8346.84 - 8348.84] P:1289.00 E:0.081881 |  Cheers
[8348.84 - 8350.84] P:1683.16 E:0.103087 |  Thank you, Joe
[8350.84 - 8352.84] P:1652.33 E:0.112691 |  buzzing
[8352.84 - 8354.84] P:1577.62 E:0.112151 |  Some kid, isn't he Alan?
[8354.84 - 8356.84] P:1650.09 E:0.096009 |  I mean, just, just, not only as a player
[8356.84 - 8358.84] P:1833.48 E:0.083901 |  but just how he conducts himself
[8358.84 - 8360.84] P:1887.21 E:0.089349 |  how he talks
[8360.84 - 8362.84] P:1656.89 E:0.105152 |  how he takes everything in his strike
[8362.84 - 8364.84] P:1637.70 E:0.093304 |  class, I think everything about him
[8364.84 - 8366.84] P:1683.83 E:0.103857 |  isn't it just the way he sort of handles everything
[8366.84 - 8368.84] P:1684.45 E:0.089385 |  it's, um
[8368.84 - 8370.84] P:1933.79 E:0.099419 |  it's so impressive, he played a huge part
[8370.84 - 8372.84] P:1957.89 E:0.100818 |  particularly in the first half
[8372.84 - 8374.84] P:1701.01 E:0.090750 |  with his, with his passing
[8374.84 - 8376.84] P:1710.52 E:0.108069 |  and his pace of his passing
[8376.84 - 8378.84] P:1562.09 E:0.097861 |  nothing faces him, does it?
[8378.84 - 8380.84] P:1763.68 E:0.083448 |  at all, he just looks so comfortable
[8380.84 - 8382.84] P:1801.25 E:0.097183 |  and at home and everything that he's doing
[8382.84 - 8384.84] P:1744.86 E:0.083655 |  He added an, I don't know if
[8384.84 - 8386.84] P:1696.72 E:0.108007 |  I don't think he said that to John there
[8386.84 - 8388.84] P:1593.60 E:0.095382 |  but he added this when he spoke to TV earlier
[8388.84 - 8390.84] P:1596.59 E:0.085767 |  we're not just here to get to the final
[8390.84 - 8392.84] P:1601.62 E:0.111096 |  and call it quits, we've got a job to do
[8392.84 - 8394.84] P:1766.41 E:0.089106 |  Well, he was my player of the match
[8394.84 - 8396.84] P:1770.84 E:0.086814 |  I, I, I
[8396.84 - 8398.84] P:1726.01 E:0.091686 |  would go with him if I had to pick one
[8398.84 - 8400.84] P:1572.36 E:0.097592 |  out of an England team
[8400.84 - 8402.84] P:1719.24 E:0.102418 |  across the 90 minutes averaging out
[8402.84 - 8404.84] P:1581.69 E:0.090559 |  I thought he was absolutely superb
[8404.84 - 8406.84] P:1804.37 E:0.082239 |  he showed
[8406.84 - 8408.84] P:1683.19 E:0.086136 |  every side to his game tonight
[8408.84 - 8410.84] P:1657.15 E:0.081082 |  he was tackling, intercepting the ball
[8410.84 - 8412.84] P:1661.25 E:0.089629 |  getting into position
[8412.84 - 8414.84] P:1530.51 E:0.103426 |  what he did with the ball
[8414.84 - 8416.84] P:1622.39 E:0.095537 |  he's got this lovely way of letting the ball roll across
[8416.84 - 8418.84] P:1694.06 E:0.094054 |  or he puts his foot on top of it
[8418.84 - 8420.84] P:1592.96 E:0.090370 |  and he sees the space and he just rolls it
[8420.84 - 8422.84] P:1746.70 E:0.096883 |  quickly when he's gone
[8422.84 - 8424.84] P:1829.19 E:0.090837 |  he opens, he's got this kind of big stride
[8424.84 - 8426.84] P:1514.80 E:0.097681 |  he moves up the ground and then he's at the back
[8426.84 - 8428.84] P:1464.78 E:0.085363 |  and then he's slipping passes off
[8428.84 - 8430.84] P:1576.96 E:0.102497 |  he was absolutely superb
[8430.84 - 8432.84] P:1723.80 E:0.086613 |  and that, that kind of body language that he has
[8432.84 - 8434.84] P:1818.67 E:0.073795 |  he looks
[8434.84 - 8436.84] P:1714.40 E:0.097416 |  just, just completely relaxed but for, for player's age
[8436.84 - 8438.84] P:1745.55 E:0.093533 |  I mean he doesn't bear the
[8438.84 - 8440.84] P:1682.86 E:0.090397 |  the, the size of the occasion at all
[8440.84 - 8442.84] P:1589.97 E:0.084736 |  on his shoulder
[8442.84 - 8444.84] P:1650.41 E:0.113694 |  his, his stats is he tonight
[8444.84 - 8446.84] P:1740.77 E:0.073427 |  51 touches
[8446.84 - 8448.84] P:1649.22 E:0.086906 |  36 passes completed
[8448.84 - 8450.84] P:1713.32 E:0.097981 |  2 chances created
[8450.84 - 8452.84] P:1491.08 E:0.095258 |  100% long balls completed
[8452.84 - 8454.84] P:1644.55 E:0.093832 |  100% of his jewels won
[8454.84 - 8456.84] P:1749.93 E:0.096952 |  2 interceptions
[8456.84 - 8458.84] P:1603.60 E:0.088123 |  2 tackles and that, and that's the other thing
[8458.84 - 8460.84] P:1630.56 E:0.105432 |  and that and Alan I think mentioned it
[8460.84 - 8462.84] P:1802.37 E:0.095885 |  a half time
[8462.84 - 8464.84] P:1636.59 E:0.099751 |  2 or 3 times in that first half
[8464.84 - 8466.84] P:1610.52 E:0.077505 |  defensively he saved England
[8466.84 - 8468.84] P:1692.00 E:0.084803 |  yeah, yeah those stats are brilliant
[8468.84 - 8470.84] P:1685.38 E:0.098943 |  I was really actually thinking then when you were speaking
[8470.84 - 8472.84] P:1676.13 E:0.083138 |  I'd love to know his stats
[8472.84 - 8474.84] P:1834.39 E:0.096686 |  so thanks for filling that void chappers
[8474.84 - 8476.84] P:1809.29 E:0.101886 |  he, he, he's good for something
[8476.84 - 8478.84] P:1859.16 E:0.118482 |  hang on, is he, is he hold it
[8478.84 - 8480.84] P:1739.78 E:0.092424 |  hold it and just go back down to the tunnel
[8480.84 - 8482.84] P:1804.20 E:0.110109 |  next for John Murray Jude Bellingham
[8482.84 - 8484.84] P:1725.96 E:0.088902 |  yeah it's, it's Jude Bellingham
[8484.84 - 8486.84] P:1618.02 E:0.099288 |  and Jude the, the story
[8486.84 - 8488.84] P:1455.69 E:0.079450 |  goes on
[8488.84 - 8490.84] P:1424.48 E:0.110164 |  and I, I told you last time we lived to fight another day
[8490.84 - 8492.84] P:1573.08 E:0.099572 |  that we, you know, another late goal
[8492.84 - 8494.84] P:1560.45 E:0.096289 |  it'd be nice to score first at some point
[8494.84 - 8496.84] P:1496.81 E:0.078672 |  and have that kind of peace of mind
[8496.84 - 8498.84] P:1544.76 E:0.097546 |  but when you know that you have players coming
[8498.84 - 8500.84] P:1581.70 E:0.090728 |  off the bench are in the starting 11 now, going to go right
[8500.84 - 8502.84] P:1540.04 E:0.077276 |  to the end
[8502.84 - 8504.84] P:1636.65 E:0.087335 |  it really doesn't matter and we know
[8504.84 - 8506.84] P:1481.21 E:0.102243 |  we're always in the game, we know we're going to fight
[8506.84 - 8508.84] P:1600.07 E:0.090077 |  with each other till the end and you know the
[8508.84 - 8510.84] P:1619.82 E:0.102384 |  rewards come if you do the right things and we did that tonight
[8510.84 - 8512.84] P:1645.09 E:0.089757 |  it had a lot of different sides to it
[8512.84 - 8514.84] P:1509.56 E:0.088595 |  that game didn't it? Yeah definitely you know
[8514.84 - 8516.84] P:1756.62 E:0.100187 |  I think even when they scored the first goal
[8516.84 - 8518.84] P:1612.55 E:0.096903 |  I didn't think we were playing badly to be honest
[8518.84 - 8520.84] P:1552.62 E:0.095758 |  it's one of those things where ball turns over
[8520.84 - 8522.84] P:1708.37 E:0.081761 |  and it's a good finish to be fair and
[8522.84 - 8524.84] P:1703.27 E:0.104155 |  yeah we didn't even really take a dip after we conceded
[8524.84 - 8526.84] P:1614.37 E:0.095835 |  it felt like we got straight back into the rhythm of the game
[8526.84 - 8528.84] P:1675.63 E:0.088589 |  and that's probably why it took
[8528.84 - 8530.84] P:1648.96 E:0.087870 |  so quick to get back into it and
[8530.84 - 8532.84] P:1387.83 E:0.076727 |  yeah really happy
[8532.84 - 8534.84] P:1540.93 E:0.099528 |  really proud of the boys, the reaction again
[8534.84 - 8536.84] P:1587.85 E:0.102588 |  the attitude, the mentality
[8536.84 - 8538.84] P:1550.81 E:0.109077 |  the quality is one thing but those kind of
[8538.84 - 8540.84] P:1627.25 E:0.068447 |  characteristics you can't
[8540.84 - 8542.84] P:1723.82 E:0.099352 |  learn in everyday training
[8542.84 - 8544.84] P:1665.90 E:0.074645 |  you get it from experience
[8544.84 - 8546.84] P:1603.09 E:0.095630 |  and each other you know and
[8546.84 - 8548.84] P:1461.39 E:0.072221 |  really proud that it's rubbing off on each other
[8548.84 - 8550.84] P:1784.77 E:0.097254 |  I'm feeling the euphoria here
[8550.84 - 8552.84] P:1643.54 E:0.102034 |  you know England players, Garosław Skic, just to our left
[8552.84 - 8554.84] P:1719.19 E:0.043414 |  but
[8554.84 - 8556.84] P:1485.00 E:0.095529 |  you're here to win the whole thing aren't you?
[8556.84 - 8558.84] P:1754.99 E:0.109865 |  Yeah that's it and you know at the start of the
[8558.84 - 8560.84] P:1652.79 E:0.085932 |  tournament you look at it after a long season
[8560.84 - 8562.84] P:1541.93 E:0.074378 |  you think seven games, oh my god seven games
[8562.84 - 8564.84] P:1637.50 E:0.103255 |  and I think that's the way I've approached it
[8564.84 - 8566.84] P:1637.68 E:0.107891 |  and the game that's gone by whether it's positive
[8566.84 - 8568.84] P:1641.44 E:0.085307 |  negative it's one more down
[8568.84 - 8570.84] P:1629.59 E:0.097510 |  till we get to Berlin and now it's one more game
[8570.84 - 8572.84] P:1717.67 E:0.077373 |  and we're tired
[8572.84 - 8574.84] P:1702.89 E:0.103519 |  you know it's been a long season but it's
[8574.84 - 8576.84] P:1718.77 E:0.085270 |  one more last push for our country
[8576.84 - 8578.84] P:1612.62 E:0.095551 |  for our families for each other
[8578.84 - 8580.84] P:1753.09 E:0.098499 |  and for history really
[8580.84 - 8582.84] P:1574.50 E:0.066102 |  so we'll give it everything
[8582.84 - 8584.84] P:1600.09 E:0.077611 |  And for you it's Spain
[8584.84 - 8586.84] P:1797.88 E:0.103633 |  Yeah one season, the old club in the Champions League
[8586.84 - 8588.84] P:1812.51 E:0.089190 |  final and then the country that are playing
[8588.84 - 8590.84] P:1635.65 E:0.090227 |  in the European Championship final
[8590.84 - 8592.84] P:1637.73 E:0.094448 |  so yeah a weird one
[8592.84 - 8594.84] P:1549.96 E:0.078745 |  obviously you know a lot of the players well
[8594.84 - 8596.84] P:1461.97 E:0.064005 |  had an amazing tournament
[8596.84 - 8598.84] P:1468.38 E:0.103306 |  but you know I'm always confident
[8598.84 - 8600.84] P:1638.83 E:0.093852 |  in the ability and the characters that we have
[8600.84 - 8602.84] P:1560.23 E:0.091409 |  in our change room so it'll be interesting
[8602.84 - 8604.84] P:1496.07 E:0.084098 |  to get them to go toe to toe
[8604.84 - 8606.84] P:1471.24 E:0.089431 |  Jude well done, we'll see you in Berlin
[8606.84 - 8608.84] P:1581.76 E:0.081080 |  See you in Berlin mate
[8608.84 - 8610.84] P:1683.69 E:0.086543 |  Something very
[8610.84 - 8612.84] P:1725.02 E:0.104108 |  amusing about Jude Bellingham calling
[8612.84 - 8614.84] P:1783.02 E:0.096370 |  John Murray mate at the end of that interview
[8614.84 - 8616.84] P:1582.02 E:0.110303 |  I tell you what
[8616.84 - 8618.84] P:1787.39 E:0.093149 |  if Jude Bellingham finds himself at the start
[8618.84 - 8620.84] P:1709.73 E:0.089033 |  of that game on the left hand side
[8620.84 - 8622.84] P:1836.82 E:0.097309 |  I would imagine his teammate
[8622.84 - 8624.84] P:1888.39 E:0.095528 |  at Real Madrid, Danny Carver-Hall might
[8624.84 - 8626.84] P:1857.98 E:0.093090 |  give him an early little
[8626.84 - 8628.84] P:1813.50 E:0.066552 |  hello
[8628.84 - 8630.84] P:1774.22 E:0.108656 |  He may well do and I'm not too sure if
[8630.84 - 8632.84] P:1796.27 E:0.085176 |  Jude will like playing wide out on the left
[8632.84 - 8634.84] P:1773.64 E:0.095106 |  in that game, that was another feature of that second half
[8634.84 - 8636.84] P:1839.89 E:0.086012 |  that you could see that he wasn't
[8636.84 - 8638.84] P:1754.23 E:0.090926 |  too happy but he's happy to do it
[8638.84 - 8640.84] P:1860.87 E:0.079640 |  for the team and he'll do it to the best that he can
[8640.84 - 8642.84] P:1752.17 E:0.097508 |  but whether or not that really does
[8642.84 - 8644.84] P:1596.12 E:0.086839 |  slot in properly I think there is
[8644.84 - 8646.84] P:1668.63 E:0.075083 |  certainly something there but
[8646.84 - 8648.84] P:1795.52 E:0.093774 |  I mean he talks so well doesn't he, he's got such
[8648.84 - 8650.84] P:1788.36 E:0.085993 |  an amazing head on his shoulders
[8650.84 - 8652.84] P:1795.05 E:0.085072 |  for what he's done in such a short space of time
[8652.84 - 8654.84] P:1697.16 E:0.071441 |  and you know that again that belief
[8654.84 - 8656.84] P:1735.69 E:0.084816 |  of this group is going to win it
[8656.84 - 8658.84] P:1768.53 E:0.092630 |  it's just oozing out of the
[8658.84 - 8660.84] P:1673.49 E:0.070802 |  interviews at the moment after the game
[8660.84 - 8662.84] P:1830.54 E:0.109901 |  Is he trying to go back to your clubby menu point?
[8662.84 - 8664.84] P:1922.87 E:0.088609 |  Well yeah I mean
[8664.84 - 8666.84] P:1925.06 E:0.076156 |  just what stood out to me was
[8666.84 - 8668.84] P:1819.65 E:0.085773 |  the two interceptions in that first half
[8668.84 - 8670.84] P:1905.81 E:0.097076 |  really crucial reading of the game
[8670.84 - 8672.84] P:1891.67 E:0.085602 |  there was one that sustained an attack
[8672.84 - 8674.84] P:1824.34 E:0.089547 |  in the attacking third I think the Dutch had
[8674.84 - 8676.84] P:2006.90 E:0.091850 |  cleared the ball and he just slid and just kept
[8676.84 - 8678.84] P:1799.73 E:0.080363 |  the attack alive which I thought was fantastic
[8678.84 - 8680.84] P:1789.56 E:0.097671 |  and there was a defensive one as well in the first half
[8680.84 - 8682.84] P:1805.95 E:0.090553 |  and those were moments where you could feel
[8682.84 - 8684.84] P:1974.33 E:0.092592 |  the Dutch were turning the screw a little bit
[8684.84 - 8686.84] P:1878.39 E:0.073478 |  and for him just to read the game
[8686.84 - 8688.84] P:1776.71 E:0.085116 |  so well and to play with that intensity
[8688.84 - 8690.84] P:1873.14 E:0.083801 |  and that kind of awareness
[8690.84 - 8692.84] P:1478.56 E:0.093793 |  of when to release the ball, when to hold on
[8692.84 - 8694.84] P:1843.87 E:0.090074 |  to it a little bit longer it's just unbelievable
[8694.84 - 8696.84] P:1884.02 E:0.063814 |  for a 19 year old
[8696.84 - 8698.84] P:1708.70 E:0.106457 |  Let's see if we have a positive 606 trail
[8698.84 - 8700.84] P:1615.01 E:0.079936 |  Chris Sutton
[8700.84 - 8702.84] P:1745.56 E:0.065665 |  Oh yeah I mean
[8702.84 - 8704.84] P:1610.51 E:0.100309 |  what a result I'm absolutely delighted
[8704.84 - 8706.84] P:1875.44 E:0.093324 |  Mark especially for Gareth
[8706.84 - 8708.84] P:1730.20 E:0.086959 |  because normally 606s
[8708.84 - 8710.84] P:1763.48 E:0.082242 |  throughout this tournament it's been
[8710.84 - 8712.84] P:1686.20 E:0.088163 |  Gareth has got this wrong, Gareth has got that
[8712.84 - 8714.84] P:1833.61 E:0.077433 |  wrong, Gareth should be sacked
[8714.84 - 8716.84] P:1752.04 E:0.079389 |  I mean but tonight
[8716.84 - 8718.84] P:1825.46 E:0.090571 |  I thought his substitutions were first class
[8718.84 - 8720.84] P:1797.91 E:0.090537 |  taking off Harry Kane
[8720.84 - 8722.84] P:1754.51 E:0.078963 |  you know think about that it's been
[8722.84 - 8724.84] P:1651.50 E:0.085489 |  the main goal scorer for England for however long
[8724.84 - 8726.84] P:1722.71 E:0.085620 |  but being brave enough to take him off
[8726.84 - 8728.84] P:1844.93 E:0.079768 |  getting Watkins on and you made the point
[8728.84 - 8730.84] P:1655.65 E:0.093889 |  Mark about it was a cold Palmer who slipped
[8730.84 - 8732.84] P:1793.67 E:0.073795 |  the pass to him
[8732.84 - 8734.84] P:1727.21 E:0.091582 |  and he deserves a lot of credit for that
[8734.84 - 8736.84] P:1852.82 E:0.100906 |  and I'm with Izzy you didn't listen to Izzy
[8736.84 - 8738.84] P:1787.15 E:0.092683 |  and a lot of people haven't listened to me
[8738.84 - 8740.84] P:1865.11 E:0.088797 |  in this tournament it's not you start the tournament
[8740.84 - 8742.84] P:1782.79 E:0.069676 |  it's how you finish it
[8742.84 - 8744.84] P:1865.30 E:0.074103 |  I'm delighted for Gareth
[8744.84 - 8746.84] P:1806.63 E:0.090094 |  When did you say that?
[8746.84 - 8748.84] P:1851.23 E:0.059943 |  When did you say that?
[8748.84 - 8750.84] P:1688.26 E:0.096937 |  Well as you know Mark
[8750.84 - 8752.84] P:1805.95 E:0.085612 |  I'm always consistent with my opinions
[8752.84 - 8754.84] P:1777.74 E:0.085198 |  Mark and I've been saying the same thing
[8754.84 - 8756.84] P:1450.51 E:0.101086 |  all the way along now
[8756.84 - 8758.84] P:1820.95 E:0.052701 |  Oh yeah but when did you say it?
[8758.84 - 8760.84] P:1764.07 E:0.084182 |  I've said it all along
[8760.84 - 8762.84] P:1870.79 E:0.052911 |  OK
[8762.84 - 8764.84] P:1797.74 E:0.095802 |  Do you think anybody will ring in
[8764.84 - 8766.84] P:1828.07 E:0.085598 |  and find fault somewhere?
[8766.84 - 8768.84] P:1802.83 E:0.080629 |  No
[8768.84 - 8770.84] P:1937.41 E:0.060248 |  OK
[8770.84 - 8772.84] P:1672.87 E:0.079641 |  I've really really
[8772.84 - 8774.84] P:1592.22 E:0.102033 |  how can they find fault
[8774.84 - 8776.84] P:1700.93 E:0.085791 |  in what England have actually done
[8776.84 - 8778.84] P:1751.44 E:0.085444 |  they've got to
[8778.84 - 8780.84] P:1772.43 E:0.084394 |  you know a final
[8780.84 - 8782.84] P:1832.39 E:0.092259 |  I think listening to John Murray the first time England
[8782.84 - 8784.84] P:1902.37 E:0.087510 |  reached a final on
[8784.84 - 8786.84] P:1885.73 E:0.082706 |  foreign soil
[8786.84 - 8788.84] P:1707.59 E:0.089798 |  I've already had a message from one of my friends
[8788.84 - 8790.84] P:1885.43 E:0.081571 |  I haven't got many friends
[8790.84 - 8792.84] P:1937.03 E:0.077156 |  Oh God I'm just looking for a recipe
[8792.84 - 8794.84] P:1890.69 E:0.081674 |  for humble pie
[8794.84 - 8796.84] P:1836.88 E:0.074837 |  and he's one of thousands
[8796.84 - 8798.84] P:1820.67 E:0.088308 |  across the country who have doubted
[8798.84 - 8800.84] P:1769.85 E:0.082705 |  Gareth Southgate
[8800.84 - 8802.84] P:1789.17 E:0.060943 |  and Gareth Southgate has proven them wrong
[8802.84 - 8804.84] P:1807.68 E:0.102992 |  08 08 5 9 0 9
[8804.84 - 8806.84] P:1694.82 E:0.089435 |  6 9 3
[8806.84 - 8808.84] P:1742.94 E:0.102102 |  if you want to talk to Chris and Robbie
[8808.84 - 8810.84] P:1898.01 E:0.081785 |  they'll be on their way surely we should get
[8810.84 - 8812.84] P:1725.42 E:0.074207 |  Gareth Southgate at some moment
[8812.84 - 8814.84] P:1934.50 E:0.092723 |  we've done a lot of these games
[8814.84 - 8816.84] P:1718.69 E:0.091287 |  Matt Allen Izzy where we've sat
[8816.84 - 8818.84] P:1784.76 E:0.079636 |  by the family and friends
[8818.84 - 8820.84] P:1589.53 E:0.084463 |  as they wait for players to come out
[8820.84 - 8822.84] P:1634.47 E:0.104700 |  after what has not been a very
[8822.84 - 8824.84] P:1688.00 E:0.081560 |  good evening there are a lot of
[8824.84 - 8826.84] P:1802.70 E:0.094848 |  smiles down there at the moment
[8826.84 - 8828.84] P:1836.08 E:0.081698 |  they've got to embrace it
[8828.84 - 8830.84] P:1937.48 E:0.084652 |  they've got to enjoy it what an occasion
[8830.84 - 8832.84] P:1923.90 E:0.088813 |  and I hope they can
[8832.84 - 8834.84] P:1789.12 E:0.061946 |  they know when we heard from Jude didn't they
[8834.84 - 8836.84] P:1996.65 E:0.103969 |  and said there's one to go
[8836.84 - 8838.84] P:1896.30 E:0.080126 |  but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy tonight
[8838.84 - 8840.84] P:2083.93 E:0.095261 |  because they're under huge pressure
[8840.84 - 8842.84] P:1832.14 E:0.101303 |  and you have to be able to enjoy these moments
[8842.84 - 8844.84] P:2004.43 E:0.084977 |  that's what you're in the game for
[8844.84 - 8846.84] P:1974.46 E:0.095717 |  but also understand they've got one
[8846.84 - 8848.84] P:1876.69 E:0.062617 |  one big game to go
[8848.84 - 8850.84] P:1774.89 E:0.089469 |  it is really important they enjoy tonight
[8850.84 - 8852.84] P:1802.19 E:0.095747 |  actually it is and I'll take that back
[8852.84 - 8854.84] P:1687.98 E:0.086899 |  to the comments Gareth made before the
[8854.84 - 8856.84] P:1589.10 E:0.077519 |  the game and that it's not normal
[8856.84 - 8858.84] P:1822.93 E:0.072873 |  it's not normal that you keep achieving
[8858.84 - 8860.84] P:1694.14 E:0.069811 |  back you know back to back
[8860.84 - 8862.84] P:1638.76 E:0.094791 |  finals or semi-finals
[8862.84 - 8864.84] P:1586.78 E:0.089215 |  I mean these are big moments in any
[8864.84 - 8866.84] P:1751.24 E:0.071572 |  players career from any country
[8866.84 - 8868.84] P:1511.20 E:0.090624 |  but this group of players are doing it consistently
[8868.84 - 8870.84] P:1484.78 E:0.077392 |  we're now in another final
[8870.84 - 8872.84] P:1562.63 E:0.075215 |  to absolutely take a step back
[8872.84 - 8874.84] P:1697.83 E:0.102905 |  and see your family enjoy it
[8874.84 - 8876.84] P:1768.73 E:0.076062 |  embrace it you know they're amazing
[8876.84 - 8878.84] P:1766.90 E:0.081119 |  memories aren't they for these lads
[8878.84 - 8880.84] P:1653.19 E:0.071807 |  and you've got to make the most of it
[8880.84 - 8882.84] P:1767.14 E:0.093373 |  more reaction Harry Kane
[8882.84 - 8884.84] P:1648.38 E:0.066276 |  Inglard Cubs and with Kelly Somers
[8884.84 - 8886.84] P:1367.24 E:0.110207 |  Harry you England players have given them
[8886.84 - 8888.84] P:1318.79 E:0.098595 |  fans some memorable nights over the years
[8888.84 - 8890.84] P:1484.71 E:0.087385 |  but this one's up there isn't it
[8890.84 - 8892.84] P:1514.64 E:0.088682 |  100% I mean another
[8892.84 - 8894.84] P:1766.89 E:0.101948 |  another semi-final win it doesn't get more special than that
[8894.84 - 8896.84] P:1482.12 E:0.096142 |  so yeah unbelievable
[8896.84 - 8898.84] P:1759.83 E:0.090259 |  tournament so far we've had to show
[8898.84 - 8900.84] P:1760.89 E:0.096393 |  unbelievable character resilience
[8900.84 - 8902.84] P:1641.44 E:0.079461 |  physical strength
[8902.84 - 8904.84] P:1735.89 E:0.111503 |  mental strength which we've shown it all
[8904.84 - 8906.84] P:1539.71 E:0.092963 |  but there's still one more to go
[8906.84 - 8908.84] P:1787.61 E:0.103043 |  and we spoke a lot after the last final
[8908.84 - 8910.84] P:1492.53 E:0.087122 |  about being back here being back
[8910.84 - 8912.84] P:1484.89 E:0.094819 |  to where we belong and going that
[8912.84 - 8914.84] P:1733.51 E:0.101507 |  one step further now we have the opportunity on Sunday
[8914.84 - 8916.84] P:1654.05 E:0.099622 |  it'll be a really tough game of course
[8916.84 - 8918.84] P:1772.27 E:0.079985 |  but you know we can just take the
[8918.84 - 8920.84] P:1719.72 E:0.100478 |  belief that we from the last knockout games
[8920.84 - 8922.84] P:1612.15 E:0.075976 |  into that final now
[8922.84 - 8924.84] P:1754.29 E:0.106344 |  Talk me through the composure you showed for that penalty
[8924.84 - 8926.84] P:1606.87 E:0.084182 |  Yeah it was a
[8926.84 - 8928.84] P:1853.75 E:0.107077 |  it was a long wait obviously with the VAR now
[8928.84 - 8930.84] P:1814.32 E:0.097807 |  we're just waiting to see first if you're getting the penalty
[8930.84 - 8932.84] P:1549.16 E:0.085896 |  and then obviously it takes a bit of time
[8932.84 - 8934.84] P:1544.47 E:0.095041 |  to clear everyone out of the way but
[8934.84 - 8936.84] P:1752.63 E:0.101388 |  I practice them a lot you know
[8936.84 - 8938.84] P:1728.70 E:0.104415 |  it's something that can have a big impact on the game
[8938.84 - 8940.84] P:1854.40 E:0.100080 |  some people just assume they're easy
[8940.84 - 8942.84] P:1737.35 E:0.102607 |  or assume you just get on with it but they take a lot of practice
[8942.84 - 8944.84] P:1664.08 E:0.089465 |  a lot of mental strength as well
[8944.84 - 8946.84] P:1544.00 E:0.090941 |  and yeah of course I was really happy to see that one going
[8946.84 - 8948.84] P:1416.48 E:0.098348 |  Happy for Ollie I imagine as well
[8948.84 - 8950.84] P:1462.92 E:0.105402 |  we noticed that you went over to celebrate
[8950.84 - 8952.84] P:1577.95 E:0.088731 |  and with them pretty quickly
[8952.84 - 8954.84] P:1777.88 E:0.094296 |  Yeah look we're a team all 26 of us
[8954.84 - 8956.84] P:1582.19 E:0.104344 |  we did deep we talked a lot
[8956.84 - 8958.84] P:1817.52 E:0.092161 |  before the tournament about everyone being ready
[8958.84 - 8960.84] P:1750.27 E:0.099792 |  whether you play one minute five minutes
[8960.84 - 8962.84] P:1639.00 E:0.100798 |  whether you don't play at all you can have an impact
[8962.84 - 8964.84] P:1853.37 E:0.090063 |  on this team you can have an impact on this tournament
[8964.84 - 8966.84] P:1772.01 E:0.101797 |  and Ollie was the prime example he's been training well
[8966.84 - 8968.84] P:1814.39 E:0.098148 |  of course he's been itching to get on everyone wants to play
[8968.84 - 8970.84] P:1609.50 E:0.091350 |  everyone wants to get on but we got a world class
[8970.84 - 8972.84] P:1852.25 E:0.103236 |  world class squad so you have to
[8972.84 - 8974.84] P:1714.85 E:0.093232 |  be patient and when your opportunity comes
[8974.84 - 8976.84] P:1695.19 E:0.099786 |  you have to take it like he did today I mean
[8976.84 - 8978.84] P:1549.74 E:0.089155 |  what an unbelievable finish and I mean
[8978.84 - 8980.84] P:1555.26 E:0.088318 |  that moment will live with him forever
[8980.84 - 8982.84] P:1651.46 E:0.058804 |  See you on Sunday
[8982.84 - 8984.84] P:1715.32 E:0.103315 |  Harry Kay with Kelly Southerly
[8984.84 - 8986.84] P:1857.03 E:0.086970 |  with these friends and family because there are some who
[8986.84 - 8988.84] P:1802.38 E:0.076215 |  to a certain extent have been there before
[8988.84 - 8990.84] P:1833.91 E:0.094907 |  in their experience to this you know England obviously
[8990.84 - 8992.84] P:1729.76 E:0.091760 |  have made a final before on on home soil
[8992.84 - 8994.84] P:1793.63 E:0.099996 |  and you know Phil Foden or Declan Rice

[9004.84 - 9006.84] P:1928.51 E:0.084766 |  They must think is it always like this
[9006.84 - 9008.84] P:1826.44 E:0.080430 |  Yeah you've got people that are like
[9008.84 - 9010.84] P:1673.78 E:0.102950 |  kind of raising their eyes like oh here again
[9010.84 - 9012.84] P:1907.95 E:0.074232 |  and they're ones that are like wow
[9012.84 - 9014.84] P:1644.91 E:0.120190 |  what's going on
[9014.84 - 9016.84] P:1829.43 E:0.093406 |  all got a fresh round in having a little bit of a dance
[9016.84 - 9018.84] P:1827.43 E:0.083814 |  is pretty I mean honestly I mean what
[9018.84 - 9020.84] P:1690.83 E:0.095116 |  I know he hasn't gone on there
[9020.84 - 9022.84] P:1732.70 E:0.085920 |  but even a penny for his thoughts
[9022.84 - 9024.84] P:1893.65 E:0.096696 |  where he's your former club
[9024.84 - 9026.84] P:1779.30 E:0.090765 |  Alan's starting his season there and now he's in the thick of this
[9026.84 - 9028.84] P:1801.08 E:0.053422 |  Unbelievable
[9028.84 - 9030.84] P:2000.60 E:0.092350 |  What a night where's that guy going that's carrying
[9030.84 - 9032.84] P:2020.39 E:0.094944 |  that thing on his back with us selling the paints
[9032.84 - 9034.84] P:1664.86 E:0.106744 |  We need him here
[9034.84 - 9036.84] P:1698.24 E:0.093600 |  Adam Wharton's friends and family are just keeping him
[9036.84 - 9038.84] P:1873.92 E:0.097980 |  round there he ain't moving
[9038.84 - 9040.84] P:1906.52 E:0.109288 |  Send him over here guys
[9040.84 - 9042.84] P:1695.11 E:0.092390 |  Let's get some final thoughts
[9042.84 - 9044.84] P:1880.28 E:0.082736 |  from everybody
[9044.84 - 9046.84] P:1906.08 E:0.095791 |  Izzy I'll start with you because we should have
[9046.84 - 9048.84] P:1893.15 E:0.084594 |  listened to you all along
[9048.84 - 9050.84] P:1758.14 E:0.081307 |  Don't go there Chappie
[9050.84 - 9052.84] P:2047.12 E:0.098849 |  I remember saying it and I have to
[9052.84 - 9054.84] P:1983.19 E:0.087344 |  have a little word with John Murray if he was shaking his head
[9054.84 - 9056.84] P:1837.66 E:0.087000 |  out me but
[9056.84 - 9058.84] P:1725.42 E:0.080534 |  no I think that was a super performance
[9058.84 - 9060.84] P:1910.09 E:0.073623 |  a lot in it that England can take
[9060.84 - 9062.84] P:1682.65 E:0.101027 |  forward and I mean I'm so
[9062.84 - 9064.84] P:1860.96 E:0.070912 |  happy for Olly Watkins
[9064.84 - 9066.84] P:1929.85 E:0.095135 |  I keep speaking about it it's about moments
[9066.84 - 9068.84] P:1991.78 E:0.080633 |  and you know
[9068.84 - 9070.84] P:1823.13 E:0.090445 |  when you spoke about it there everyone's got a role to play
[9070.84 - 9072.84] P:1720.42 E:0.086075 |  and whatever that is and you've just got to buy into the project
[9072.84 - 9074.84] P:1923.44 E:0.087781 |  and you've got to be ready you've got to be sharp
[9074.84 - 9076.84] P:1896.41 E:0.084946 |  and Watkins comes on he's got one chance
[9076.84 - 9078.84] P:2003.76 E:0.072182 |  and he does it and look who's going to
[9078.84 - 9080.84] P:1922.63 E:0.057536 |  Bill in now
[9080.84 - 9082.84] P:1775.53 E:0.080900 |  Matt the stars are aligning
[9082.84 - 9084.84] P:1820.33 E:0.074377 |  aren't they things are happening this tournament's
[9084.84 - 9086.84] P:1932.51 E:0.088258 |  been like that at the
[9086.84 - 9088.84] P:1918.36 E:0.092167 |  right moment the right thing has happened
[9088.84 - 9090.84] P:2060.41 E:0.098992 |  whether it be a decision an amazing individual
[9090.84 - 9092.84] P:2004.12 E:0.089186 |  piece of skill
[9092.84 - 9094.84] P:2052.63 E:0.079194 |  or somebody's done something
[9094.84 - 9096.84] P:1984.20 E:0.100312 |  the manager's made the right choice it's just all
[9096.84 - 9098.84] P:1946.89 E:0.066792 |  slotting
[9098.84 - 9100.84] P:1838.76 E:0.090303 |  into place and it's building momentum
[9100.84 - 9102.84] P:1848.10 E:0.094926 |  and the performances are getting more assured
[9102.84 - 9104.84] P:1829.62 E:0.074314 |  the confidence and the arrogance on the pitch is there
[9104.84 - 9106.84] P:1850.46 E:0.066636 |  it feels good
[9106.84 - 9108.84] P:1753.33 E:0.087486 |  I just want to before we hear from Alan
[9108.84 - 9110.84] P:1600.52 E:0.092825 |  I just want to go back down
[9110.84 - 9112.84] P:1761.32 E:0.094936 |  to the tunnel have you got with you John mate
[9112.84 - 9114.84] P:1782.28 E:0.083995 |  well
[9114.84 - 9116.84] P:1677.01 E:0.084172 |  well I've got
[9116.84 - 9118.84] P:1535.83 E:0.091454 |  I've got the man who's become the first
[9118.84 - 9120.84] P:1490.38 E:0.093793 |  England manager to take a team
[9120.84 - 9122.84] P:1391.24 E:0.094410 |  to two finals Gareth Southgate congratulations
[9122.84 - 9124.84] P:1552.88 E:0.085582 |  thank you John it's a very special night
[9124.84 - 9126.84] P:1489.70 E:0.083254 |  and hopefully a special night for everybody at home
[9126.84 - 9128.84] P:1441.60 E:0.084093 |  went through the ringer again
[9128.84 - 9130.84] P:1706.62 E:0.082747 |  well
[9130.84 - 9132.84] P:1868.73 E:0.052560 |  I suppose in terms of
[9132.84 - 9134.84] P:1626.43 E:0.091396 |  a late goal but
[9134.84 - 9136.84] P:1521.48 E:0.074013 |  I thought our performance was really good
[9136.84 - 9138.84] P:1544.93 E:0.072073 |  best yet
[9138.84 - 9140.84] P:1515.07 E:0.089294 |  definitely
[9140.84 - 9142.84] P:1446.54 E:0.097173 |  we showed some signs of that in the last game with the ball
[9142.84 - 9144.84] P:1550.74 E:0.081714 |  and tonight we felt that
[9144.84 - 9146.84] P:1513.91 E:0.084506 |  you knew with
[9146.84 - 9148.84] P:1324.75 E:0.091645 |  the Netherlands that they have more quality
[9148.84 - 9150.84] P:1463.31 E:0.097276 |  so they can punish you like they did
[9150.84 - 9152.84] P:1553.35 E:0.064168 |  but
[9152.84 - 9154.84] P:1671.98 E:0.087835 |  maybe a little bit more opportunity to play
[9154.84 - 9156.84] P:1361.76 E:0.065789 |  and
[9156.84 - 9158.84] P:1590.15 E:0.094882 |  I thought our midfield players
[9158.84 - 9160.84] P:1760.79 E:0.073196 |  full folding especially
[9160.84 - 9162.84] P:1540.54 E:0.101220 |  just kept finding the space getting on the ball
[9162.84 - 9164.84] P:1546.81 E:0.078969 |  we had a lot of freedom to play
[9164.84 - 9166.84] P:1305.03 E:0.093591 |  and they had
[9166.84 - 9168.84] P:1720.33 E:0.098729 |  to keep changing what they were doing which meant
[9168.84 - 9170.84] P:1778.52 E:0.097811 |  we then had to keep changing what we were doing so
[9170.84 - 9172.84] P:1431.53 E:0.081561 |  very tactical wasn't it? it was a very complicated game
[9172.84 - 9174.84] P:1603.77 E:0.068765 |  particularly
[9174.84 - 9176.84] P:1310.06 E:0.087182 |  defensively you know Bacchio did
[9176.84 - 9178.84] P:1618.50 E:0.071941 |  an immense job for us
[9178.84 - 9180.84] P:1629.02 E:0.083408 |  he started as a wing back he covered into
[9180.84 - 9182.84] P:1745.35 E:0.094416 |  midfield he defended as a winger at times
[9182.84 - 9184.84] P:1473.05 E:0.079863 |  it was one of those nights
[9184.84 - 9186.84] P:1575.96 E:0.089293 |  where everybody had to be really flexible
[9186.84 - 9188.84] P:1683.08 E:0.088619 |  but the players made so many good decisions
[9188.84 - 9190.84] P:1461.31 E:0.076490 |  on the pitch
[9190.84 - 9192.84] P:1733.86 E:0.092856 |  and on the subject of good decisions
[9192.84 - 9194.84] P:1763.68 E:0.096457 |  substitutions you bring on those two guys
[9194.84 - 9196.84] P:1345.01 E:0.093130 |  Palmer and Watkins and they
[9196.84 - 9198.84] P:1587.09 E:0.090061 |  combined for a stunning goal really
[9198.84 - 9200.84] P:1301.69 E:0.082827 |  no it was
[9200.84 - 9202.84] P:1541.86 E:0.067584 |  I mean we were happy
[9202.84 - 9204.84] P:1526.35 E:0.097166 |  with how Phil and Harry were playing
[9204.84 - 9206.84] P:1499.05 E:0.080958 |  Harry had definitely
[9206.84 - 9208.84] P:1736.20 E:0.073388 |  had the knock in the first half
[9208.84 - 9210.84] P:1392.50 E:0.068897 |  but
[9210.84 - 9212.84] P:1617.93 E:0.073240 |  we've got a good bench
[9212.84 - 9214.84] P:1771.72 E:0.085386 |  we had freshness
[9214.84 - 9216.84] P:1709.55 E:0.090061 |  and we know that Oli can make those little
[9216.84 - 9218.84] P:1643.15 E:0.091053 |  runs down the side which
[9218.84 - 9220.84] P:1473.14 E:0.091957 |  at the beginning of a game can be a problem but definitely
[9220.84 - 9222.84] P:1375.01 E:0.093402 |  at the end can be an even bigger problem
[9222.84 - 9224.84] P:1738.43 E:0.082577 |  and
[9224.84 - 9226.84] P:1613.61 E:0.096497 |  Cole has been showing those moments as well
[9226.84 - 9228.84] P:1533.68 E:0.069111 |  so in many respects
[9228.84 - 9230.84] P:1627.89 E:0.094533 |  there's no way Phil deserved to come off but we just
[9230.84 - 9232.84] P:1503.99 E:0.086597 |  thought a bit of freshness
[9232.84 - 9234.84] P:1557.64 E:0.089646 |  and worth going through it before extra time really
[9234.84 - 9236.84] P:1301.27 E:0.076480 |  and so it's a
[9236.84 - 9238.84] P:1444.35 E:0.095029 |  final in Berlin on Sunday
[9238.84 - 9240.84] P:1671.29 E:0.074738 |  against Spain
[9240.84 - 9242.84] P:1582.17 E:0.100214 |  first time England have been to a final on foreign
[9242.84 - 9244.84] P:1439.37 E:0.085257 |  soil but I'm sensing here
[9244.84 - 9246.84] P:1356.81 E:0.098758 |  in the dressing room area the England players
[9246.84 - 9248.84] P:1455.87 E:0.090260 |  we've spoken to that there is
[9248.84 - 9250.84] P:1554.11 E:0.083574 |  a determination
[9250.84 - 9252.84] P:1335.79 E:0.078643 |  no question I mean
[9252.84 - 9254.84] P:1408.67 E:0.100438 |  this is what we came here to do and we've been
[9254.84 - 9256.84] P:1563.89 E:0.091201 |  building for two years towards this
[9258.84 - 9260.84] P:1364.38 E:0.102148 |  you know we've got to enjoy tonight
[9260.84 - 9262.84] P:1606.07 E:0.097101 |  because you have to enjoy nights like this
[9262.84 - 9264.84] P:1334.24 E:0.082966 |  but equally it's such a quick
[9264.84 - 9266.84] P:1327.17 E:0.088630 |  turn around and we've got a day less
[9266.84 - 9268.84] P:1386.37 E:0.098437 |  than the team we've been the best in the tournament
[9268.84 - 9270.84] P:1405.34 E:0.083105 |  so far so it's going
[9270.84 - 9272.84] P:1288.63 E:0.092409 |  to be a very very tough game
[9272.84 - 9274.84] P:1552.37 E:0.088279 |  but you wouldn't expect to get to a final
[9274.84 - 9276.84] P:1422.52 E:0.072013 |  and it not be so yeah
[9276.84 - 9278.84] P:1418.03 E:0.083915 |  it's fabulous for everybody at home
[9278.84 - 9280.84] P:1353.70 E:0.094678 |  to look forward to
[9280.84 - 9282.84] P:1254.55 E:0.102742 |  where we'll see you in Berlin then thanks Gareth
