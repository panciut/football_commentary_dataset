[8.24 - 17.20] P:1719.04 E:0.097201 |  winner's medal in 1953 after the Matthews final and on the program cover tonight that famous moment
[17.20 - 23.12] P:1740.63 E:0.092535 |  it's in black and white but I'm sure you remember it in vivid technical are those who can remember
[23.76 - 29.28] P:1932.53 E:0.104672 |  the Queen who is in her yellow coat and a yellow feathered hat handing the jewel

[43.68 - 51.52] P:1836.86 E:0.094870 |  of people have now put their lights on on their phones and Jeff Hearst and Burt Neumann and Debbie
[52.48 - 58.48] P:1777.14 E:0.100665 |  have walked to the side of the pitch and placed those white flowered wreaths on the side of the
[58.48 - 65.12] P:1539.79 E:0.090614 |  pitch and the two sets of players are gathered around the center circle to remember the late Queen
[111.52 - 129.60] P:1722.47 E:0.046770 |  the image of the Queen's face on the huge electronic screens above either end of the ground
[130.16 - 134.96] P:1786.77 E:0.099007 |  and it really was actually a very subtle and effective touch to to dim the lights inside
[134.96 - 140.24] P:1662.75 E:0.096427 |  Wembley Stadium just add that element of darkness and all of the lights in the stands
[142.24 - 147.52] P:1721.65 E:0.099871 |  so the team's now ready for the start of the match England and Germany playing each other
[148.48 - 155.52] P:1874.74 E:0.087314 |  for what is the 34th time old foes
[157.44 - 164.64] P:1751.37 E:0.097113 |  England in the red Germany in the white shirts just 55 days to go before the world cup kicks off
[165.36 - 173.04] P:1688.53 E:0.095111 |  and exactly two months to the day before England play Iran there is only this 90 minutes of
[173.04 - 179.68] P:1789.17 E:0.107767 |  football to play for England Danny Macalee blows his whistle a huge cheer from the Wembley crowd
[179.68 - 185.36] P:1706.29 E:0.090032 |  a full house here this evening and Germany get us underway and immediately fire the ball forward
[185.92 - 190.48] P:1651.20 E:0.102737 |  and there's a header away on the edge of the box it comes back to Harry Maguire who just
[190.48 - 196.48] P:1784.65 E:0.095785 |  lifts it forward into the center circle and Harry Kane is pulled over on the halfway line
[196.48 - 203.04] P:1769.06 E:0.087339 |  although I think he's given it for Kane's initial challenge on Schlotterbeck although Kane looks
[203.04 - 209.36] P:1588.02 E:0.091892 |  over his shoulder and glares at the referee as if to say how can you have the temerity not to give
[209.36 - 217.44] P:1702.52 E:0.099494 |  that my way Chris Sutton he does but he also looks over his shoulder and catches Schlotterberg in the
[217.68 - 224.16] P:1659.40 E:0.097983 |  neck and takes him out really so I think that was the correct decision so England and Germany
[224.16 - 228.88] P:1615.47 E:0.098333 |  the England side tonight if you've not heard two changes from Friday night in Milan Nick Pope
[228.88 - 233.76] P:1591.52 E:0.089666 |  continues in goal stones Dyer and Maguire the three central defenders James on the right
[233.76 - 237.68] P:1671.42 E:0.090519 |  Shaw on the left Dullingham and Rice in the middle Fodman Stirling either side of Kane
[238.24 - 243.28] P:1822.50 E:0.108195 |  and England win the ball back here Shaw plays it up towards Stirling Stirling who scored the opening
[243.28 - 250.80] P:1857.82 E:0.095222 |  goal if you remember in the last 16 at Euro 2020 and here is Stirling who does well on the left
[250.80 - 255.44] P:1791.39 E:0.103589 |  hand side gives it to Kane through the middle that's a crunching challenge on him from Schlotterbeck
[255.44 - 260.48] P:1781.31 E:0.087715 |  who gives a bit back there to the England captain who's okay he's quickly back up on his feet
[260.48 - 266.16] P:1659.72 E:0.091459 |  and England have it again on the halfway line so the German side tonight Tess Steggen of Barcelona
[266.16 - 272.00] P:1711.13 E:0.087674 |  in goal Manuel Neuer the usual captain had COVID last week so he's not involved Leon Goretzka
[272.00 - 277.52] P:1814.66 E:0.094793 |  likewise they courted it Octoberfest apparently so the back four tonight I'll tell you in a moment
[277.52 - 282.88] P:1844.64 E:0.102216 |  because England have it on the right hand side it's played for for Kane Kane turns and twists and
[282.88 - 287.52] P:1891.80 E:0.103728 |  plays the ball in and it comes off the shins of a German defender and out of play for a throwing
[287.52 - 292.56] P:1794.16 E:0.086500 |  down the right hand side Kane is going to take this quickly which he does back to Reese James
[293.20 - 299.04] P:1739.96 E:0.089833 |  James in field towards Declan Rice looking forward to seeing how this Rice-Bellingham
[299.04 - 304.88] P:1793.25 E:0.084238 |  partnership is going to look tonight and now Shaw on the left hand side Shaw gives it back
[304.88 - 309.52] P:1540.04 E:0.093392 |  and McGuire just stretching for it plays it to Eric Dyer playing for England again at Wembley
[309.52 - 314.24] P:1467.16 E:0.093737 |  after making his England return with the ball halfway inside his own half so that German side
[314.24 - 320.08] P:1611.61 E:0.085789 |  Tess Steggen in goal back four of Kera Zula Schlotterbeck and round and Kimmich and Gundewan
[320.08 - 325.20] P:1627.08 E:0.097329 |  in center field lots of familiar names in this German side Hoffman on the right who scored
[325.20 - 329.28] P:1685.28 E:0.100998 |  when they played each other in Munich in June in the nation's league earlier in the group
[329.28 - 335.76] P:1621.34 E:0.091575 |  Jungtjermal Moussiala the number 14 who played for so many of the young England teams but has
[335.76 - 341.60] P:1561.64 E:0.087762 |  committed himself to Germany exciting by a Munich talent Leroy Zanne on the left and Kai Havertz
[341.60 - 348.24] P:1683.42 E:0.089674 |  up front so Nilnil very early stages were in the third minute Chrisson yeah in England with a 343
[349.20 - 352.72] P:1794.32 E:0.098796 |  formation in the Germans setting up they started with a back four
[352.96 - 359.84] P:1736.34 E:0.075196 |  against Hungary went to a three back three in the second half but they'll try and dominate the ball
[359.84 - 367.84] P:1691.50 E:0.078447 |  the Germans will as they do in most games just lack that punch in recent times albeit they did get
[367.84 - 374.32] P:1619.80 E:0.086200 |  five against Italy but Kera Zaske really needs a performance from his England team this evening
[374.88 - 380.40] P:1343.73 E:0.107306 |  yep that was their only win in their last six internationals Germany and there are questions
[380.40 - 384.64] P:1416.19 E:0.103524 |  being asked about Hansi Flickside so that's the other side of the coin tonight it's important for
[384.64 - 390.48] P:1593.47 E:0.100638 |  Germany as well as England and England playing the ball too sterling he's way over there on the far
[390.48 - 395.60] P:1336.45 E:0.096507 |  side of the field but he's surrounded by Germans on either side of him and it is Germany who come
[395.60 - 402.08] P:1661.50 E:0.099927 |  away with the ball and it's deflected out of play in the end a German foot so Luxo has a
[402.08 - 408.08] P:1309.08 E:0.098603 |  throwing level with the edge at his own penalty area England Nil Germany Nil BBC Radio 5 Live
[408.16 - 415.84] P:1251.81 E:0.090398 |  Listen as well on BBC sounds tonight and Luxo still waiting to take this throwing making his
[415.84 - 422.48] P:1448.12 E:0.092090 |  return to the England starting line he's not started for club or country Luxo since August
[422.48 - 426.56] P:1540.88 E:0.107066 |  the 13th started Manchester United's first two matches of the season and there's a slip on the
[426.56 - 432.32] P:1746.69 E:0.085660 |  halfway line by Raum the left back but Rhys James was quickly closed down and James gets it back
[432.32 - 438.88] P:1588.82 E:0.081699 |  now from Bellingham Bellingham wants it Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund playing against so many
[438.88 - 446.40] P:1682.69 E:0.088199 |  familiar faces for him James now on the right hand side James being forced in field by Raum
[446.40 - 452.40] P:1724.25 E:0.090747 |  he is Bellingham again but kind of habits is after him so it has to go back to John Stones who gives
[452.40 - 456.24] P:1670.49 E:0.094685 |  it back to Nick Pope who quickly gets rid of it straight away I think that's probably the best
[457.12 - 461.68] P:1821.50 E:0.104666 |  option for the new Castle goalkeeper Keynes overhits it pass out to the left hand side
[461.68 - 466.96] P:1673.28 E:0.087927 |  sure can't reach that it's out of play for a three to the Germans yeah well Nick Pope interesting
[466.96 - 473.52] P:1667.13 E:0.079729 |  call getting the not again this evening but I've got to say he always looks a bit clumsy with his
[473.52 - 480.56] P:1702.81 E:0.083085 |  feet uncomfortable yeah clumsy uncomfortable but he kicked one out of play a couple of minutes ago
[480.56 - 486.72] P:1737.90 E:0.078984 |  didn't he and then taking no chances there but see the way the Germans have set up they'll
[486.72 - 493.12] P:1646.77 E:0.087227 |  really overload the centre of the pitch and England have got to find a way of getting up the pitch
[493.12 - 500.80] P:1731.38 E:0.092996 |  which they struggled to do and go against Italy they were from Declan Rice centrally then the balls
[500.80 - 505.84] P:1693.51 E:0.098346 |  played over the top for Sterling down the left hand side but that's tied it up by big Nicholas Zula
[505.84 - 511.52] P:1784.32 E:0.101538 |  passes it back to Kers Degen excellent goalkeeper to have as your second choice the Barcelona man
[511.52 - 516.40] P:1402.71 E:0.102778 |  who passes it out from the back and then Rhys James concedes a throw in just down in front of us
[516.40 - 521.28] P:1190.28 E:0.110758 |  here our commentary box back in our commentary box our glass fronted commentary box at Wembley Stadium
[522.16 - 528.88] P:1087.31 E:0.106598 |  in these better times round playing it infield to Kimmich who then passes it back to Thier Steegert
[528.88 - 534.80] P:1203.52 E:0.105921 |  second choice but it is his 30th cab lots of experience and here is young Muziala who's
[534.80 - 540.32] P:1358.80 E:0.096456 |  carrying the ball forward from the halfway line but then Declan Rice is able to step into his path
[540.32 - 545.12] P:1343.33 E:0.099458 |  but Muziala is back on the ball again the number 14 giving it out towards the the right hand side
[545.12 - 550.96] P:1426.10 E:0.090575 |  Hoffman is there now Kimmich is involved back more centrally to Gundawan square from Gundawan
[550.96 - 556.32] P:1482.57 E:0.106983 |  remember Gundawan was injured wasn't able to play in the game here at the Euros when England
[556.32 - 562.16] P:1532.54 E:0.096374 |  eventually and dramatically and excitingly won it with the two late goals now Thomas Mulla in the
[562.16 - 568.80] P:1533.70 E:0.091880 |  team tonight that's one of the four changes that Hansy Flick has made to his team from Friday night
[569.04 - 575.52] P:1533.40 E:0.088766 |  Rudiger suspended so he couldn't be involved Gnabry Mulla and Verna are all among the substitutes
[575.52 - 582.64] P:1282.38 E:0.100294 |  here is the Manchester City man Gundawan gives it to Hoffman and then back into the German half the
[582.64 - 588.40] P:1385.35 E:0.090980 |  white shirts of Germany with a big black stripe down the middle a little bit like the Ajax style
[588.40 - 594.56] P:1317.18 E:0.093066 |  black shorts and white socks so everyone's got their World Cup kits on in this in these international
[594.56 - 601.36] P:1301.37 E:0.096311 |  matches these are the shirts that we will see in Kata in two months time when we will bring you
[601.36 - 608.00] P:1465.64 E:0.097974 |  every blow of that World Cup on Five Live and here on BBC Radio here is Muziala nice nice turn
[608.00 - 613.68] P:1611.58 E:0.103795 |  away from Rice little touch to Kimmich but that breaks down and now Thornton can bring it forward
[613.68 - 618.24] P:1744.94 E:0.109670 |  for England over the halfway line Thornton just a little touch to Kane to his right hand side
[618.24 - 622.16] P:1654.46 E:0.108859 |  Sterling's available on the edge of the box Kane curls it in towards the back post but beyond the
[622.16 - 627.60] P:1555.41 E:0.100901 |  run of Thornton and it will run over the white line and behind for a goal kick that's when England
[627.60 - 632.96] P:1408.75 E:0.107130 |  look at their most dangerous turn over there belling him did well to win the ball back and
[633.52 - 640.56] P:1612.47 E:0.107988 |  England they're away as the ball goes out wide right to Harry Kane it's a terrific ball in it really
[640.56 - 648.24] P:1638.35 E:0.074901 |  is and he's not far away from picking out Raheem Sterling and Phil Thornton at the back post in fact
[648.48 - 657.36] P:1576.85 E:0.086949 |  so Germany with it inside their own penalty area that was another feature of the other night you
[657.36 - 661.20] P:1430.78 E:0.101820 |  know the talk of how England need to move the ball more quickly I feel like we say that virtually
[661.20 - 666.96] P:1391.27 E:0.092293 |  every time England get together at one stage or another but also making the right decisions and
[668.72 - 673.84] P:1452.91 E:0.093047 |  and that was better that more promising from England but nil nil very early stages here's
[673.84 - 679.68] P:1484.80 E:0.087617 |  Gundawan the bearded Gundawan looks up and then just taps it forward towards Muziala can play in
[679.68 - 685.76] P:1420.86 E:0.101753 |  any number of positions Muziala the 19 year old Bayern Munich man who's made a brilliant start to
[685.76 - 691.12] P:1408.34 E:0.094698 |  this season as well here is Gundawan 30 yards out just runs his foot over the ball England have
[691.12 - 694.96] P:1521.49 E:0.104498 |  got everyone apart from Harry Kane in their defensive third he has to cross from the right
[694.96 - 699.04] P:1616.65 E:0.098077 |  hand side which doesn't reach habits but Eric Dyer was behind behind him and headed behind for the
[699.04 - 705.20] P:1602.28 E:0.090955 |  first corner match to the visitors from Germany in Germany just controlling the game a little bit
[705.20 - 710.64] P:1614.00 E:0.097317 |  in the early stages England there said that was a 5-4-1 defending deep cross ball goes in
[711.84 - 717.04] P:1564.29 E:0.099459 |  the Germans have just lacked in that central striking position have heard starts up there tonight
[717.04 - 721.12] P:1547.62 E:0.097743 |  I'm not sure that's his favorite position I know he plays there for Chelsea
[722.08 - 727.60] P:1583.23 E:0.090639 |  well this corner looks as though it's going to be swung in by round now with RB Leipzig
[727.60 - 733.04] P:1517.12 E:0.095164 |  after his move in the summer round hits this very very deep towards the back post habits actually
[733.04 - 737.44] P:1642.96 E:0.094312 |  peeled away there tried to bring it down with his left foot but couldn't get a touch couldn't get a
[737.44 - 741.92] P:1802.37 E:0.109717 |  clean touch and he's buffered it off the ball and England bring it forward with John Stones who
[741.92 - 746.24] P:1653.59 E:0.107619 |  looks to thread a pass century that was a good pass to Sterling over the halfway line and then
[746.24 - 749.76] P:1535.88 E:0.095891 |  Sterling tried to play through to Fordham's run I think he might have been offside anyway
[749.76 - 754.88] P:1699.46 E:0.094297 |  as it is a German defender blocked it and that's a poor touch by Kane and Germany are able to clear
[754.88 - 760.88] P:1687.51 E:0.091743 |  it away on the edge of the box through Schrotter Beck and Eric Dyer then challenges in the centre
[760.88 - 766.08] P:1485.19 E:0.093295 |  circle but England have got it back yeah and that's when they have looked dangerous in the early stages
[766.08 - 774.88] P:1584.42 E:0.080417 |  England counter-attack and Stones with that tantalizing left foot crossfield pass just got there
[774.88 - 781.36] P:1518.21 E:0.089325 |  Sterling cut inside Fordham had made his run a little bit too early German high line
[783.20 - 787.76] P:1505.14 E:0.104633 |  that's Chris Sutton with us and Ross Townsend is here as well another England international
[787.76 - 792.08] P:1664.29 E:0.100795 |  Nick Pope is caught in possession and the ball bounces for Germany on the edge of the box and
[792.08 - 798.00] P:1705.12 E:0.098099 |  back it comes to Gundewan who hits the shot from the edge of the D just tried to whip it curled
[798.00 - 804.56] P:1604.92 E:0.090041 |  into the top corner but too high with the the shot by two or three feet but Nick Pope caught in
[804.56 - 812.00] P:1651.73 E:0.087068 |  possession he did he just delay took a heavy first touch in fact he was unaware of Havertz I
[812.00 - 816.08] P:1616.73 E:0.092400 |  think it was he put him under pressure the shot from Gundewan just over the bar but
[817.52 - 824.40] P:1576.03 E:0.089757 |  doesn't instill you with great confidence Nick Pope with the ball at his feet so why not Ramstail
[824.40 - 832.56] P:1542.93 E:0.086918 |  tonight why why you pop again I think it's a it's a strange call in many respects but a call
[832.56 - 838.80] P:1612.63 E:0.085329 |  which is saying to me Nick Pope you're my number two so Ramstail Ramstail's better with his feet
[838.80 - 844.56] P:1520.80 E:0.088523 |  than Nick Pope significantly but Ramstail did start the two matches the second two matches
[845.28 - 851.92] P:1449.77 E:0.095681 |  in in June in this competition against Italy in Hungary at Mollin new but Nick Pope's been selected
[851.92 - 857.68] P:1642.95 E:0.100281 |  for both of these here's Rice gets the ball down gives it a sterling on the left wing sterling
[858.48 - 862.48] P:1622.00 E:0.100960 |  is up against Kimmich out there actually got past Kimmich but then there was the covering challenge
[863.36 - 869.36] P:1686.91 E:0.101167 |  coming in from Tilo Kera and the ball bounces I would play for a Throin to England near the corner
[869.36 - 873.44] P:1477.51 E:0.091103 |  flag on the left hand side in front of all of those German flags that are dripped over the
[873.44 - 877.76] P:1528.79 E:0.090916 |  first few seats in that section in that corner actually the Throins got to be taken
[878.08 - 883.76] P:1540.45 E:0.088590 |  more towards the middle of the half sure we're now to play there but sure
[883.76 - 888.72] P:1499.97 E:0.089506 |  that's preferentially stopped him didn't he to say take it higher up yeah normally the other way
[888.72 - 894.00] P:1579.33 E:0.095546 |  around no sterling gives it back to Kane then Kane's return pass but he was blocked by Kera
[894.00 - 897.12] P:1615.00 E:0.104016 |  who actually just turns into no particular pressure and puts the ball out of play for
[897.12 - 901.60] P:1437.48 E:0.092747 |  another England throw down the left hand side this is seven or eight yards away from the corner flag
[902.56 - 911.12] P:1433.51 E:0.090592 |  uh yeah Stuart just hands the ball to Shaw who again takes it probably six or seven yards away
[911.12 - 916.96] P:1452.78 E:0.093266 |  from where it actually went out sterling now in the box Rice is there as well back to uh
[917.68 - 923.36] P:1573.03 E:0.097400 |  and the offside flag is up against Luke Shaw who'd come back from an offside position that was all
[923.36 - 930.64] P:1664.93 E:0.089283 |  rather odd yeah that that's the the assistant with the the light flag that infuriates people
[930.64 - 937.28] P:1564.18 E:0.082493 |  doesn't around the country with the late flag for offside it didn't look like it was offside
[938.08 - 944.80] P:1559.60 E:0.101401 |  well in fact yeah we're getting infuriated already tonight we've only played 12 minutes
[945.76 - 952.72] P:1520.27 E:0.094301 |  England nil Germany nil and very few empty seats around Wembley Stadium I guess it'll be
[953.84 - 958.56] P:1615.62 E:0.105820 |  early 80 000 as the ball is played down the left hand side but it's beyond sterling and it
[958.56 - 963.28] P:1521.21 E:0.089888 |  runs out of play and it's a throwing to the Germans halfway inside their own half in actual fact
[963.28 - 967.36] P:1597.96 E:0.089382 |  Germany will play a game before their opening match at the World Cup the Germans in a group with
[967.36 - 972.72] P:1494.37 E:0.087804 |  Japan Spain and Costa Rica but because they're one of the latest starters in the World Cup they've
[972.72 - 980.16] P:1366.32 E:0.085094 |  been able to organize a game on the Wednesday before so they'll play in muscat against a man on the
[980.16 - 985.76] P:1577.85 E:0.093156 |  Wednesday and then they'll fly to Qatar because you have to be in the country five days before you
[985.76 - 992.56] P:1574.60 E:0.089768 |  play so the Germans will have a friendly match before the real thing begins but not England this
[992.56 - 998.56] P:1471.13 E:0.091808 |  is the end of the meaningful action for garros southgate and his team still England nil Germany nil
[998.56 - 1005.28] P:1518.96 E:0.085353 |  and rather like the other night in Milan very few opportunities for the opening goal so far
[1005.92 - 1011.04] P:1461.40 E:0.090446 |  here is Gundawan he's had the the shot over the top of the English crossbar Gundawan gets it back
[1011.04 - 1015.52] P:1552.41 E:0.098794 |  looks over his shoulder and then he lifts a ball for that was very Manchester City style
[1015.52 - 1018.88] P:1362.98 E:0.100223 |  but England are able to deal with that on the edge of the box and he has Maguire now on the left
[1018.88 - 1024.48] P:1497.46 E:0.099032 |  hand side who clears but that's blocked down and now Maguire recovers and is able to put a foot in
[1024.48 - 1030.16] P:1621.13 E:0.088228 |  and block it out for another corner for the Germans yeah Maguire in the first instance trying to make
[1030.16 - 1037.12] P:1615.56 E:0.086147 |  the clearance it was blocked and there's a ball broke free in the wide area Maguire got a good
[1037.12 - 1042.48] P:1610.72 E:0.091962 |  block on recovered well well round took the first corner that Germany had from over there on the
[1042.48 - 1048.32] P:1460.07 E:0.088572 |  right hand side but this is going to be kimmick instead so this is an out swinger is it Germany
[1048.32 - 1053.44] P:1550.68 E:0.091208 |  play from right to left as we look from the dressing room side of the ground in the first half
[1053.44 - 1057.92] P:1420.63 E:0.093773 |  kimmick raises his right arm and then fires this into the back post it's over the top of habits
[1057.92 - 1062.40] P:1542.24 E:0.098903 |  it's headed back across the England penalty area Maguire headed it away not a further away by bearing
[1062.40 - 1067.20] P:1658.68 E:0.090520 |  him on the edge of the box a stretching header as he moved backwards by Harry Kane and then it's
[1067.20 - 1072.80] P:1488.27 E:0.086111 |  volleyed forwards into the centre circle by Rehan Sterling but the Germans are back in possession
[1072.80 - 1078.72] P:1535.46 E:0.093256 |  and the central defender Schubert gives it back to Gunduan who is behind him in Germany are able
[1078.72 - 1085.92] P:1442.85 E:0.089629 |  to assume possession of the ball again inside England territory. We're in about 80,000 people but
[1085.92 - 1092.96] P:1539.52 E:0.086358 |  Wembley very very quiet because they haven't seen anything yet to get them off their seats
[1092.96 - 1100.32] P:1495.48 E:0.083642 |  from England here's kimmick kimmick back to Schlotterbeck and then back in the centre circle
[1100.32 - 1107.76] P:1324.10 E:0.090286 |  Nicholas Zula to the right hand side it goes Kara the new West Ham signing playing it right back
[1107.76 - 1112.80] P:1449.58 E:0.099232 |  tonight Gunduan plays it in to the edge of the area but Bellingham dives forward and blocks that out
[1112.96 - 1120.24] P:1601.65 E:0.098481 |  actually well the referee spotted a foul by it was uh James on round who made a run on the inside
[1120.24 - 1126.96] P:1530.14 E:0.085829 |  of Rhys James this was off the ball yeah and uh and James bought round down and protested to the
[1126.96 - 1132.80] P:1459.69 E:0.088699 |  referee I don't know whether he's got a little heads up from one of the assistants there but this
[1132.80 - 1137.84] P:1357.78 E:0.090431 |  is a that's a good spot by the referee that I mean that was not in his eye line that was off the
[1138.56 - 1144.88] P:1358.71 E:0.084568 |  whether that was him who spotted it or whether you know an assistant has made that decision but
[1144.88 - 1153.04] P:1520.30 E:0.090343 |  good range this isn't it what 23 24 yards out well that's it that's it that's a cheap free free
[1153.04 - 1159.04] P:1383.50 E:0.096470 |  kick to concede by Rhys James a little naive you might say but this is left of centre and I've
[1159.04 - 1164.96] P:1405.17 E:0.104767 |  seen Gunduan be able to hit them from here Leroy Zane is there as well Zane is making it look as though
[1165.44 - 1170.24] P:1430.87 E:0.094912 |  it's going to be him to take this but this could easily be Gunduan with the with the right foot
[1170.24 - 1176.64] P:1623.67 E:0.091378 |  so this is going to be a test for Nick Taub England have put up a uh a five man wall a someone lying
[1176.64 - 1183.44] P:1439.32 E:0.093773 |  down behind it as well but there's also a four man German wall to the right as we look of the uh of
[1183.44 - 1188.64] P:1437.70 E:0.092551 |  the England wall and actually England have put two men behind the German wall looks like there's
[1188.72 - 1196.88] P:1637.91 E:0.095144 |  three walls there John all in all and also the man lying behind as well so it is Zane who will
[1196.88 - 1201.84] P:1686.54 E:0.107436 |  take and he hits it into the middle of the the wall to the left well the biggest wall the biggest
[1201.84 - 1208.16] P:1698.03 E:0.107236 |  wall yeah and then uh England bring it away and James his trip and it's a free kick to England
[1208.16 - 1213.52] P:1334.10 E:0.094994 |  half being saved around half and actually that seems to have woken up a few other crowd be the
[1213.60 - 1219.84] P:1410.26 E:0.094849 |  wall yeah the wall just standing firm and doing their job and the crowd are excited what how many
[1219.84 - 1225.20] P:1235.82 E:0.098889 |  minutes are we in now we are 17 minutes in stadium buzzing
[1226.80 - 1233.52] P:1568.86 E:0.095338 |  I don't think I've got quite that far England nil Germany nil once we've played 20 minutes we'll
[1233.52 - 1237.28] P:1418.33 E:0.097818 |  bring in Andros Townsend I think for a little thought on what's happened but there's not a great
[1237.28 - 1244.64] P:1447.61 E:0.091553 |  deal for Andros to analyze at this stage of the game but it is a free kick that England have near
[1244.64 - 1251.76] P:1502.14 E:0.085787 |  the centre circle that eric Dyer will wander forward to take I don't I don't think we're surprised
[1251.76 - 1258.48] P:1459.65 E:0.083025 |  by the way Gareth has set up you know they're set up to defend deep and counter against the
[1258.48 - 1264.96] P:1504.82 E:0.087514 |  German team who want to dominate the ball this is a German team who even though they've won only one
[1264.96 - 1269.92] P:1463.63 E:0.091412 |  of their last six matches as I mentioned that defeat on Friday night against Hungary that was
[1269.92 - 1275.20] P:1499.80 E:0.088982 |  Hansy Flick's first defeat as the as the manager of Germany of the national team champions league
[1275.20 - 1280.96] P:1488.51 E:0.095818 |  winning coach with Bayern Munich that's spectacular but relatively brief spell that he had in charge of
[1280.96 - 1288.64] P:1535.74 E:0.083114 |  Bayern Munich and losing his first match out of 14 after winning the first eight he has
[1288.64 - 1293.36] P:1389.16 E:0.093911 |  Tess Steggen with the ball in front of his penalty area Tess Steggen just knocking the ball
[1293.92 - 1298.16] P:1409.08 E:0.091315 |  two or three yards in front of himself and then over hitting the ball downfield that Nick Polk
[1298.16 - 1302.96] P:1520.39 E:0.105338 |  should deal with at the other end which he does just picks it up so England nail Germany nail BBC
[1302.96 - 1308.40] P:1459.12 E:0.096796 |  Radio 5 live and BBC sounds tomorrow night more nations league commentary with rather more on the
[1308.40 - 1315.20] P:1585.04 E:0.090986 |  line in the nations league as Scotland go for promotion to League A so our team will be in
[1315.20 - 1319.68] P:1636.72 E:0.091896 |  Krakow in Poland for Ukraine against Scotland you'll be hearing that if you're listening to five
[1319.68 - 1324.24] P:1529.87 E:0.092033 |  live this time tomorrow night ball played over the top four Germany he has Havertz on the right
[1324.24 - 1329.44] P:1497.49 E:0.088022 |  hand side one of the players in the German team not necessarily in the best of form with Chelsea
[1329.44 - 1334.16] P:1380.41 E:0.091952 |  at the start of this season ball headed forward for Sterling who nods it down and then it's taken
[1334.16 - 1342.00] P:1615.71 E:0.098683 |  up by Bellingham two Germans both of the central midfielders Gündewan and Kimmich catch Bellingham
[1342.00 - 1347.20] P:1490.56 E:0.097879 |  at the same time and it's a pre-kick for England inside their own half what about the theory Chris
[1347.84 - 1353.76] P:1463.77 E:0.085155 |  this this promising pair race in Bellingham might be even better if there were three of them in that
[1353.76 - 1358.08] P:1560.80 E:0.095432 |  central midfield area what have you made of the partnership between them so far
[1360.08 - 1366.16] P:1526.83 E:0.092747 |  look I thought Bellingham performed well the other evening in Italy I really did I think Declan Rice
[1367.36 - 1373.84] P:1613.85 E:0.090904 |  start of the season has been okay but I think his role is key in this England team he has to
[1373.84 - 1381.28] P:1628.73 E:0.090761 |  really move the ball really quickly in Sicef passes passes which we haven't seen really in an
[1381.28 - 1387.92] P:1573.15 E:0.089239 |  England jersey Schoes giving it away and it was given to Gündewan now on the right hand side comes
[1387.92 - 1392.64] P:1695.10 E:0.097612 |  back in field towards Kimmich Kimmich chips it from right to left headed away by James on the edge
[1392.64 - 1397.28] P:1509.08 E:0.103350 |  of the box and Phil Forden is there on the edge of his own penalty area plays it back to Stones and
[1397.28 - 1403.12] P:1581.62 E:0.095878 |  Pope had to clear very quickly there it was slightly under hit by Stones but Pope was quick
[1403.12 - 1408.88] P:1566.31 E:0.087700 |  quickly enough onto it and just right footed it rattled it away downfield I think it was Hoffman
[1408.88 - 1417.20] P:1635.68 E:0.085175 |  who Stones was completely unaware of Hoffman as the ball was popped back to him he had a blind pass
[1417.20 - 1423.04] P:1559.89 E:0.079358 |  back to Nick Pope he fortunately got his big right boot to it Harry Maguire just glances
[1423.04 - 1428.32] P:1429.87 E:0.099063 |  ahead across the penalty area and Schoes will clear it away towards the halfway line 20 minutes
[1428.32 - 1432.32] P:1397.10 E:0.098706 |  played then England nail Germany nail and Drostan Zenders here with us what have you what have you
[1432.32 - 1436.72] P:1556.34 E:0.090994 |  thought so far and I think it's clear that in the first 20 minutes this England side have
[1436.72 - 1443.60] P:1600.70 E:0.089362 |  picked up where they left off the other night not much attacking threat yes with the ball at his
[1443.60 - 1447.12] P:1663.11 E:0.098551 |  feet so I thought I better come in there and Ross but he's been able to take a touch and clear it
[1447.12 - 1452.48] P:1480.95 E:0.096832 |  away carry on yeah not much attacking threat defended very well as a unit as a collective not
[1452.48 - 1459.20] P:1650.78 E:0.089450 |  really given much space to this German side had a few counter attacking moments but again in isolation
[1459.52 - 1465.92] P:1462.48 E:0.083916 |  when the when the front three or the front five a counter attacking the back three aren't getting
[1465.92 - 1472.56] P:1475.08 E:0.090253 |  up high enough which isn't allowing us to then sustain attacks in in in in the German defensive
[1472.56 - 1478.80] P:1598.56 E:0.088729 |  half and yeah we're allowing them to get out but I'd like to see more combinations between our front
[1478.80 - 1484.32] P:1573.48 E:0.090591 |  three which we didn't get the other night we've seen one or two signs but not much to write home
[1484.32 - 1489.52] P:1604.15 E:0.103207 |  about no that sums it up very well James still playing it at the left hand side kinect is there
[1489.52 - 1493.92] P:1508.45 E:0.093631 |  on the edge of the box though to clear away and gunned a one is able to pass it back to his goal
[1493.92 - 1501.20] P:1518.07 E:0.089166 |  keep at Tess Deggen who pulls it on with left foot and finds the pass to the halfway line Havertz
[1501.20 - 1508.48] P:1578.63 E:0.092767 |  was onto that Zanne as well but then Eric Dyer back in position half winside his own half gives it
[1508.48 - 1513.20] P:1439.06 E:0.102865 |  to John Stones on the right hand side Stones ball forward looking for Bellingham that's headed down
[1513.20 - 1518.80] P:1575.16 E:0.099353 |  by Zula who hasn't quite got it away Foden was after it shot a bit with a touch Gundawan is in
[1518.80 - 1524.72] P:1573.72 E:0.103340 |  there as well it's bounced to Kain Kain right side of the penalty area Bellingham wants it short in
[1524.72 - 1531.04] P:1688.47 E:0.101636 |  fact Kain gives it to James and then in comes a very good challenge by left back round and Germany
[1531.04 - 1535.52] P:1486.91 E:0.097523 |  are off on the counter attack Zanne to Muziala Muziala could have gone long with the pass instead
[1535.52 - 1540.32] P:1511.55 E:0.099003 |  he goes square Hoffman now takes it on gets his head down up the right wing he goes into the
[1540.32 - 1544.96] P:1593.69 E:0.096551 |  England left back position Hoffman's cross to the back post it's turned back in field by round
[1544.96 - 1549.68] P:1706.16 E:0.104480 |  comes to round again and then a stretch away from McGuire to safety and the ball's out of play
[1550.24 - 1554.96] P:1698.84 E:0.103561 |  and England under pressure there England nil Germany nil halfway through the first half here
[1554.96 - 1562.08] P:1493.50 E:0.084629 |  at Wembley Stadium and it's time for Ian Dennis to halftime thank you John that all comes from
[1562.08 - 1566.24] P:1491.78 E:0.101395 |  Rhys James losing the ball there and that will do who wonders from McGuire I thought it was a
[1566.24 - 1571.20] P:1665.50 E:0.091544 |  timely intervention from in his penalty area England not missing out on the marketing opportunity
[1571.20 - 1576.48] P:1629.09 E:0.099194 |  to wear their away strip at home in the new kit they all red playing from left to right as we look
[1576.48 - 1581.92] P:1610.65 E:0.083250 |  against Germany in their white shirts with that broad black stripe going down the middle
[1581.92 - 1591.28] P:1588.36 E:0.084541 |  and it is nil nil on BBC Radio 5 Live there have been a couple of nervy moments for for Pope with
[1591.28 - 1597.12] P:1598.89 E:0.087727 |  the ball at his feet but apart from that England have certainly defended a lot better than they
[1597.12 - 1603.52] P:1585.13 E:0.089902 |  did if you think back to the opening 10 minutes quite a nervy start in Milan on Friday night
[1603.52 - 1609.20] P:1642.49 E:0.092483 |  Germany have a throw on this near side the left 10 yards in round to take it arcs its way in headed
[1609.20 - 1615.04] P:1690.07 E:0.098893 |  out by stones picked up by Rhys on the edge of his penalty area held up though by by Hoffman
[1615.04 - 1620.72] P:1722.20 E:0.103722 |  and then McGuire plays the ball forward and then it's laid back and now England can come forward
[1620.72 - 1624.96] P:1820.35 E:0.118335 |  and it's a ball through the middle looking towards Raheem Sterling Sterling enters the penalty
[1624.96 - 1630.96] P:1752.90 E:0.107559 |  area Sterling saved by the goalkeeper to Steggen cut back onto his left foot about 12 yards out from
[1630.96 - 1636.24] P:1761.25 E:0.103147 |  goal central position and to Steggen making the save all in blue away towards his right hand side
[1636.24 - 1641.92] P:1703.29 E:0.110951 |  by far the best opportunity of the game nil nil and what a pass this is I think it's Luke Shaw who
[1641.92 - 1648.32] P:1733.96 E:0.093586 |  hits the pass from from deep and it's curled around the back of the German defense and Raheem

[1652.56 - 1657.44] P:1770.64 E:0.103675 |  corner what a save that is Sterling with a layoff Foden towards Harry Kane it's played behind him
[1657.44 - 1662.88] P:1776.59 E:0.107292 |  and Kara the right back the West Ham United defender on the cover tucks in turns it behind for a
[1662.88 - 1667.60] P:1746.96 E:0.102352 |  corner kick but two really promising bits of play for England in the space of 60 seconds
[1667.60 - 1673.36] P:1675.43 E:0.100092 |  important clearance from Kara but Phil Foden should have taken greater care with his cross
[1673.36 - 1678.24] P:1771.24 E:0.099097 |  because Harry Kane would have had the easiest opportunities six yards out level with the
[1678.24 - 1684.64] P:1783.97 E:0.093451 |  near post poor pass from Phil Foden John scorn set piece so for England corner kick near side
[1684.64 - 1690.80] P:1786.74 E:0.097248 |  the right James to take it right armour loft in it comes now right footed was actually flicked on
[1690.80 - 1697.60] P:1770.71 E:0.096402 |  by John Stones in a way but Bellingham will keep that ball in play over on that far side
[1698.16 - 1703.52] P:1772.15 E:0.103023 |  the brush your Dortmund midfielder inside towards Raheem Sterling who turns links up once again
[1703.52 - 1708.40] P:1820.70 E:0.110495 |  with Bellingham and then it's taken off his toes by Hoffman and it's gone behind for another
[1708.40 - 1715.84] P:1758.87 E:0.105643 |  corner kick by far England's best spell of the game 26 minutes play goalie yeah and I suppose
[1715.84 - 1721.68] P:1636.56 E:0.108688 |  you know with the lack of goals in the last five games it's those moments when you have those
[1721.68 - 1728.32] P:1719.83 E:0.093025 |  opportunities just to be a bit more careful with that final ball and Foden missing Harry Kane
[1729.12 - 1733.12] P:1720.10 E:0.110568 |  all about those fine margins as the corner kick from the left hand side
[1733.68 - 1739.52] P:1691.58 E:0.109001 |  heavy goal it's by Kane comes back to Kane and with a dipping balling from the right hand side
[1739.52 - 1745.76] P:1814.73 E:0.103236 |  of the penalty area he hit it first time right footed and it drops probably about half a foot wide
[1745.76 - 1752.80] P:1496.61 E:0.094525 |  of that left hand post as we look 0-0 I mean this is such wonderful technique from Harry Kane as the
[1752.80 - 1761.60] P:1363.70 E:0.100097 |  ball dropping what would he be 14 yards out at an angle trying to dip the ball back over
[1761.60 - 1768.96] P:1386.87 E:0.100410 |  Ter Stegen into the far corner he wasn't far away a yard past Ter Stegen's right hand post
[1770.00 - 1773.84] P:1375.23 E:0.109153 |  when you're having great fun with John and he was talking about the various walls
[1773.84 - 1779.92] P:1377.00 E:0.104247 |  I'm surprised you never said it's a wall of silence because at the time Wembley was quite
[1779.92 - 1785.60] P:1358.51 E:0.095122 |  quiet but they've certainly been livened up with those England efforts three of them in
[1787.04 - 1791.68] P:1483.27 E:0.106045 |  rapid fire time but it's Germany now who are coming forward and the ball from the

[1819.52 - 1826.24] P:1713.16 E:0.093463 |  as now it's Zula a burly figure of the central defender of Germany he's
[1827.44 - 1833.28] P:1820.23 E:0.117721 |  lost it now with Wussi Arla and Kane to Sterling ladies off it was a heavy touch a very heavy
[1833.28 - 1838.32] P:1761.79 E:0.100371 |  touch from Raheem Sterling but once again that front three of Kane Sterling of Foden were looking
[1838.32 - 1844.80] P:1750.91 E:0.083475 |  to try and profit yeah and when Germany do overturn the ball that's when England have looked at
[1844.80 - 1851.28] P:1672.00 E:0.094631 |  their most dangerous but on the break there Kane into Sterling in a central position a really poor
[1851.28 - 1857.04] P:1675.01 E:0.088797 |  touch as Sterling just tried to cushion the ball to Phil Foden who've made a good run on the right

[1864.24 - 1874.56] P:1571.31 E:0.096470 |  successive matches for the first time since 2000 you have to go back to 1981 the only
[1874.64 - 1880.88] P:1477.13 E:0.093935 |  time in England's history where they fail to score in four successive games here is Gundelwander

[1955.92 - 1963.68] P:1647.93 E:0.106271 |  on the inside now to a to Hoffman and then Kara dives inside the penalty area looking for a penalty
[1963.68 - 1970.08] P:1684.74 E:0.107456 |  now that is where you're wanting your referee to take action I mean there there isn't a slight
[1970.08 - 1976.16] P:1744.17 E:0.098568 |  clip isn't there outside the box from Stirling but it's an exaggerated dive absolutely he's so
[1976.24 - 1982.40] P:1658.58 E:0.083872 |  much better than that Kara I knew you were going to say that ball played away by Tishtegen

[2203.76 - 2211.44] P:1599.36 E:0.095624 |  of course England have already been relegated and will the 2024 competition will be in the second tier

[2217.28 - 2222.64] P:1543.41 E:0.103166 |  get another word from there from Andros who's alongside us here before the the break is Gundelwan
[2222.64 - 2229.84] P:1551.42 E:0.095995 |  picks it up plays the ball forward headed away by by stones and then James has lost the ball to
[2229.84 - 2234.80] P:1615.90 E:0.091046 |  round the left back now it's with Mussiala and Mussiala was looking to try and get on that ball
[2234.80 - 2239.44] P:1688.12 E:0.109310 |  there on the edge of the area here is stones there with interception towards Foden and Foden can run
[2239.44 - 2244.72] P:1801.25 E:0.111480 |  forward Cain having to check his run stones just pulled up there looking towards sterling
[2244.72 - 2249.20] P:1674.90 E:0.101208 |  through the goalkeeper he's got a big problem there John Stones was looking to make a running
[2249.20 - 2255.20] P:1544.73 E:0.085152 |  behind the German high line he's gone down I'm not a medical expert they know but that's a right hand
[2255.20 - 2262.72] P:1671.23 E:0.084519 |  string Foden was looking towards sterling but whilst that was happening stones has pulled up
[2262.72 - 2268.08] P:1565.75 E:0.083221 |  and he sat down and he's now just on the halfway line and doesn't look like he's going to be in a
[2268.08 - 2273.44] P:1623.91 E:0.094391 |  position to continue so let's bring in Andros what have you you made of the game in Andros so
[2273.44 - 2279.20] P:1588.90 E:0.089058 |  far 10 minutes to go to halftime yeah again we've had our moments and spells initially straight
[2279.20 - 2284.24] P:1455.24 E:0.094056 |  after that 20 minute period we had a few attacks back to back we've managed to stay in their half
[2284.80 - 2289.68] P:1549.00 E:0.087862 |  for a few minutes which I haven't seen in the last definitely in the last 100 minutes of
[2289.68 - 2295.12] P:1469.09 E:0.087392 |  football that I've been watching England play including the other night but still I feel like
[2295.12 - 2300.72] P:1461.62 E:0.089396 |  when we're counter attacking it's too isolated where Declan Rice making a marauding run sterling's
[2300.72 - 2306.56] P:1456.44 E:0.086412 |  got in a few times we're not backing up the play there's too much space between those counter
[2306.56 - 2311.28] P:1432.68 E:0.090812 |  attacking and those behind the two midfielders need to get higher the three centre halves I know
[2311.28 - 2316.48] P:1470.56 E:0.088902 |  they're worried about their pace but they need to get higher as well we need to get some sustained
[2316.48 - 2322.80] P:1540.73 E:0.088156 |  possession in this German half and we're not doing that at the minute as Andros town's ends
[2322.88 - 2328.32] P:1557.82 E:0.093538 |  England international and here is Chris Sutton I mean it's very basic England's brand of football
[2328.32 - 2335.20] P:1612.46 E:0.086879 |  that you know that's the truth I mean when the ball goes back to Nick Pope he kicks the ball up
[2335.20 - 2340.00] P:1654.27 E:0.088906 |  the pitch Harry Kane tries to flick it on and Raheem Sterling makes a movement off him and
[2340.00 - 2345.28] P:1584.82 E:0.082785 |  but where England have been dangerous is in the turnover and when they've counterattacked and
[2345.28 - 2350.80] P:1413.84 E:0.096261 |  and you know it's just been that final ball at times but England haven't really found a way of
[2350.80 - 2357.52] P:1687.03 E:0.084231 |  playing out from the back through this German team who are pressing high but even if you are
[2357.52 - 2361.60] P:1448.69 E:0.100714 |  going to play that way it is very basic if you are going to play up to Harry Kane and try and get
[2361.60 - 2367.44] P:1760.88 E:0.094100 |  flip-bombs and try and get a knockdown if your two midfielders are on the halfway line they're never
[2367.44 - 2371.44] P:1661.80 E:0.091713 |  going to pick up the bits so then Germany win it back straight away and they're attacking us again
[2371.44 - 2378.32] P:1588.63 E:0.081357 |  and then we retreat back to our back to our shape in our own half so yes it's one thing playing
[2378.32 - 2382.56] P:1376.68 E:0.090291 |  basic playing up to Harry Kane but if you haven't got the runners off him or behind him back from him
[2382.56 - 2388.40] P:1768.29 E:0.108695 |  up you're not going to get any joy at all. John Stone's unable to continue and the way that he
[2388.40 - 2392.16] P:1778.86 E:0.095815 |  pulled up you would think that it'd be a doubt for the Manchester Derby a game incidentally you
[2392.16 - 2398.24] P:1737.66 E:0.094170 |  can hear live on Sunday afternoon on BBC Radio 5 live seven appearances for Manchester City five
[2398.24 - 2404.48] P:1757.11 E:0.086052 |  starts in the Premier League as well this season for for John Stones so a doubt ahead of the the
[2404.48 - 2409.92] P:1711.47 E:0.090097 |  Manchester Derby and he's replaced by his Manchester City teammate Kyle Walker that was one of two
[2409.92 - 2415.60] P:1694.60 E:0.089740 |  changes from the side that lost to Italy on Friday made by by Gareth Southgate so Kyle Walker
[2415.60 - 2422.96] P:1691.38 E:0.083865 |  comes on for his 70th cap for England tonight to play on the right side of that three-man defence
[2422.96 - 2431.92] P:1480.54 E:0.085442 |  talking of City, Gundewan, Stutterbeck with the cross headed away by Shaw who hasn't played in
[2431.92 - 2435.84] P:1578.07 E:0.103587 |  the Premier League for Manchester United since that defeat at Brentford he's actually had less
[2435.84 - 2440.88] P:1617.93 E:0.102300 |  game time for United than Harry Maguire here is Bellingham charging forward for the red of England
[2440.88 - 2446.96] P:1855.63 E:0.101420 |  to Sterling, Shaw's going to go on the overlap Sterling carries the ball forward now he utilises
[2446.96 - 2453.20] P:1753.91 E:0.105475 |  Shaw and the cross is charged down and deflected behind for a corner kick and it remains 0-0 with
[2453.20 - 2459.44] P:1355.84 E:0.099969 |  seven minutes to go to halftime and that attack stemmed from a wonderful pass from Phil Foden
[2459.44 - 2465.68] P:1545.26 E:0.100977 |  brave for 30 yards from his own goal little reverse pass in England once again looking at danger
[2465.68 - 2469.76] P:1655.84 E:0.088817 |  on the counter attack can they make something in this corner?

[2993.20 - 2997.84] P:1636.71 E:0.099267 |  extended away towards his right but as we look it was off target from the left hand post and
[2997.84 - 3003.52] P:1584.70 E:0.094543 |  behind for a goal kick nil nil in stoppage time the England defense very deep couple of yards
[3003.52 - 3010.48] P:1661.88 E:0.091588 |  inside the box and now he's sterling the closest man to Kimmick who shoots from a central area
[3011.12 - 3015.84] P:1663.70 E:0.084671 |  so he doesn't really shut him down and he's not far away Kimmick decent strike
[3017.36 - 3023.84] P:1679.57 E:0.086431 |  I don't give him too many shooting opportunities the reaction from tonight's game will be
[3024.96 - 3030.96] P:1778.73 E:0.114732 |  live if not before we're off air at 10 o'clock into Colin Murray's program that follows five live
[3030.96 - 3039.12] P:1680.64 E:0.088018 |  sports at 10 but the halftime whistle has sounded it's England nil Germany nil England had
[3040.64 - 3044.88] P:1705.88 E:0.101045 |  a couple of nervy moments for Nick Pope in goal and that low effort for Kimmick but apart from
[3044.88 - 3050.64] P:1720.16 E:0.095237 |  that the best spell was when Harry Kane had an effort that was off target and sterling
[3051.28 - 3056.80] P:1776.93 E:0.095126 |  with a obviously left foot brought out a save from from to Steggen in a flurry of activity
[3057.52 - 3062.32] P:1649.66 E:0.097594 |  but that's probably been about it as far as the goal mouth incidents are concerned
[3062.32 - 3068.40] P:1637.19 E:0.095152 |  and so mark a halftime England nil Germany nil you're still awake and Ross
[3071.60 - 3075.76] P:1624.15 E:0.095741 |  we've had our moments we've had our moments it's not been too bad that was just talking about
[3075.76 - 3084.00] P:1572.40 E:0.078841 |  it's listen to Chris I said no if you it's there's no intensity is that I mean from either side
[3084.00 - 3092.00] P:1627.13 E:0.077788 |  really it's all a bit a bit flat I think from from the German side they've had the
[3092.00 - 3095.76] P:1552.67 E:0.094794 |  lion's shell possession but they've not really troubled us at all they've not really
[3096.80 - 3100.24] P:1443.36 E:0.097879 |  dragged us out of position they've not gone down the side of us they've not gone over us
[3100.24 - 3105.20] P:1704.49 E:0.093190 |  they've not gone in behind us so I think from an England side even though we're not seeing large
[3105.20 - 3109.60] P:1551.74 E:0.083069 |  amounts of the ball I think we're very comfortable and where we're catching them on the counterattack
[3109.60 - 3113.76] P:1482.96 E:0.093422 |  we're very dangerous we're creating chances but we just need to be like the guy I said in commentary
[3113.76 - 3117.36] P:1644.89 E:0.094801 |  we need to be more clinical because we're not getting there as often as we would like
[3118.32 - 3125.68] P:1824.64 E:0.086208 |  Chris yeah I think there's an element of you know we we knew the way Gareth would
[3126.32 - 3131.44] P:1771.29 E:0.093012 |  set up how he sets up against the the better teams and it is to counterattack I think the truth is
[3131.44 - 3137.36] P:1734.01 E:0.089719 |  from the first half is you know as Andrew said Nick Pope hasn't really had anything to do in terms
[3137.36 - 3141.60] P:1666.94 E:0.087986 |  of shot stopping and there haven't been any big opportunities for the Germans if anything
[3142.08 - 3147.20] P:1561.61 E:0.094898 |  England have just been slightly wasteful when they have had opportunities the fold and cross
[3147.20 - 3152.16] P:1626.27 E:0.091940 |  where he has to find Kane I mean you know massive opportunity Sterling went through and you know
[3152.16 - 3157.36] P:1723.69 E:0.089109 |  it's a good save from from Ter Stegen came is a bit unlucky with uh with the volley there have been
[3157.36 - 3162.08] P:1689.74 E:0.094463 |  moments but England just have to be clinical in those moments and that's the story of the first
[3162.08 - 3168.96] P:1773.42 E:0.089658 |  half but I don't think that we it's not going to happen under Gareth for England to go toe to toe
[3168.96 - 3175.28] P:1723.52 E:0.090342 |  with the big nations and play an expansive uh brand of football it's not going to happen we have to
[3175.28 - 3181.92] P:1505.96 E:0.090541 |  accept what we are and you know it's been basic football at times Nick Pope hasn't taken any chances
[3181.92 - 3186.64] P:1499.12 E:0.093961 |  after he made an error early on and he's been like walloping balls up to Harry Kane who's trying to
[3186.64 - 3192.08] P:1467.37 E:0.091183 |  flick the ball on but where England have looked danger dangerous is uh is in the turnover when
[3192.08 - 3196.16] P:1572.12 E:0.091323 |  they've won the ball from Germany when Germany are throwing bodies forward and they have countered
[3196.48 - 3199.04] P:1487.36 E:0.087451 |  England have been a threat it's just they haven't been clinical enough

[3441.04 - 3446.48] P:1675.15 E:0.068943 |  up for and we thought that the club would be in but rather the fact that the communication and lack
[3446.48 - 3452.32] P:2055.77 E:0.071550 |  of answers and the complete uncertainty which is probably what concerns you the most whereas when
[3452.32 - 3457.28] P:1786.69 E:0.076121 |  you have good communication lines and there's a bit of certainty whichever way it may be you can
[3457.28 - 3462.08] P:1489.37 E:0.091603 |  move forward and I suppose the announcements in the last hour or two hours or whatever it might be
[3462.08 - 3467.92] P:1779.35 E:0.079645 |  have provided a bit of that we've got a call later on tonight you know as coaches and management so

[3478.32 - 3484.16] P:2195.75 E:0.096119 |  seen on Twitter with regards to the new owners you shared your frustration online too but as from
[3484.16 - 3489.04] P:1958.05 E:0.086398 |  today and I'm sure you get more clarity when you have your call what is your stance what is your
[3489.04 - 3494.24] P:1984.72 E:0.086850 |  position currently suspended from the Gallagher Premiership your employer coach players every
[3494.24 - 3500.16] P:1774.60 E:0.079054 |  single day but there is no competition. Yeah so as far as I'm concerned and the club's concerned
[3500.16 - 3506.40] P:1488.98 E:0.076261 |  Steve Dimes decided on Saturday told the management before the game told the players after the game
[3506.40 - 3510.48] P:1418.11 E:0.067199 |  we'd have to week off he said there's no point coming in because the other thing is the building
[3510.48 - 3518.16] P:1912.88 E:0.066487 |  now is an insured so it's been closed as of 4.30 this afternoon even the caretaker and his wife
[3518.16 - 3522.72] P:1735.50 E:0.064890 |  have been kicked out which is their accommodation for however long they've been there yeah I mean
[3522.96 - 3528.56] P:1567.90 E:0.080972 |  that's our appalling the whole situation is and the you know the lack of honesty and care that's
[3528.56 - 3533.68] P:1756.37 E:0.087368 |  gone into the situation to be honest with you so we can't train there so yeah look if we carried
[3533.68 - 3539.20] P:1703.43 E:0.066908 |  on training we might have to go on to a local school or a club or a field or something but I
[3539.20 - 3545.04] P:1609.70 E:0.074980 |  just don't think that does anyone any good so he's giving everyone the week off as far as that's
[3545.04 - 3552.32] P:2047.76 E:0.065566 |  concerned. I mean over the last few weeks being as you've said it's been really uncertain has
[3552.32 - 3558.24] P:1634.29 E:0.073991 |  the rugby been the gel between it all just keeping people together I know it doesn't mean
[3558.24 - 3565.04] P:1813.50 E:0.072130 |  much right now but you had a great result and sometimes rugby can bring the best of our people
[3565.04 - 3570.72] P:1652.94 E:0.080117 |  in that way has it done that in this situation? Yeah look at least it gives you something to
[3570.72 - 3575.84] P:1544.16 E:0.074340 |  focus on doesn't it for the time you're training and obviously the lads playing and you know us as
[3575.84 - 3580.32] P:1856.37 E:0.083478 |  coaches I suppose and the supporters just get behind the boys and they've all been fantastic
[3580.32 - 3586.08] P:1773.13 E:0.077143 |  and it gives you an outlet you know it's obviously an incredibly physically demanding game so
[3586.64 - 3590.24] P:1797.52 E:0.087069 |  your frustrations and anger and what other emotions you're feeling you know gives you an
[3590.24 - 3597.52] P:1808.58 E:0.074289 |  outlet but it can only go so far can't it really? Yeah we want to keep everyone on coaches and what
[3597.52 - 3602.08] P:1731.36 E:0.077744 |  I say but I mean Dimes you know he's obviously in charge of the rugby side has said that you know
[3602.08 - 3607.20] P:1605.82 E:0.072390 |  he wants to keep everyone on but he won't stand in a way of people don't want to leave and I think
[3607.20 - 3614.88] P:1883.75 E:0.070274 |  a small amount of people have asked whether they can leave I think it's you know their minds aren't
[3614.88 - 3619.68] P:1495.20 E:0.081742 |  made up I'm pretty sure well actually I know that everyone is committed to wanting to stay but obviously
[3619.68 - 3625.44] P:1723.45 E:0.077098 |  it gets to a point doesn't it where you can't just carry on being led down the garden path and
[3625.44 - 3630.72] P:1651.27 E:0.070388 |  something needs to happen and as I'll repeat you know now with the suspension and now the administration
[3631.76 - 3636.96] P:1732.63 E:0.070507 |  will be a lot closer to finding out what does happen. It's a must listen every week
[3636.96 - 3644.00] P:1772.18 E:0.073978 |  is the rugby union weekly this week more so than ever plenty more with Nick Easter with Hugo and
[3644.00 - 3651.44] P:1771.94 E:0.062022 |  Chris Ashton on the pod and the full episode will be out later tonight on BBC Sands. Now
[3651.44 - 3656.80] P:1905.65 E:0.071850 |  tomorrow night we've got live commentary of Scotland's Nations League decider against Ukraine
[3656.80 - 3663.04] P:1751.52 E:0.068727 |  in Poland Alistair Bruce Ball is there. Yes welcome to the beautiful city of Krakow in Southern Poland
[3663.04 - 3668.40] P:1907.49 E:0.086880 |  Pat Nevin and I have flown over today with a fair few blue-shirted, bequilted Scotland fans if
[3668.40 - 3673.04] P:1853.64 E:0.088179 |  that's a term I'm not sure it is they're hoping their team can get at least a point against Ukraine
[3673.04 - 3678.64] P:1859.76 E:0.088790 |  in our commentary game on Tuesday night to win group B1 of the Nations League we'll hear from the
[3678.64 - 3684.16] P:1953.58 E:0.085442 |  Scotland boss Steve Clark in a moment who's been talking ahead of the game. Pat Scotland obviously
[3684.16 - 3690.00] P:1796.39 E:0.079332 |  off the back of an excellent win against Ukraine last week but unfortunately Steve Clark is missing
[3690.00 - 3694.96] P:1679.71 E:0.078623 |  a lot of players and not just plays key players for this one. He has made a mistake of speaking
[3694.96 - 3698.64] P:1767.10 E:0.075759 |  in five live last week about the fact that we've got lots and lots of fillbacks I shouldn't have
[3698.64 - 3703.04] P:1555.42 E:0.092176 |  opened my mouth we've got hardly any left yet with so many injuries but really important ones
[3703.04 - 3707.84] P:1662.99 E:0.076418 |  obviously we knew a Robertson was out beforehand but it's certainly a big one for Cairnti and it'd
[3707.84 - 3711.84] P:1486.04 E:0.091726 |  be missing but maybe even more so and if you look down the line of centre backs that were missing
[3711.84 - 3716.56] P:1723.64 E:0.078934 |  just now Grant Hanley and Cooper were out before but McKenna missing as well so you're talking about
[3716.56 - 3721.52] P:1308.94 E:0.087993 |  an entire back lane almost it's been repped out of the team. Okay let's hear from the boss and one
[3721.52 - 3724.80] P:1795.85 E:0.097380 |  of his strikers ahead of the game so Pat's mentioned it some of the names missing Scott
[3724.80 - 3730.08] P:1812.59 E:0.090690 |  McTomonay as well actually suspended but Scott McKenna's key at the back Cairnti and one of the
[3730.08 - 3734.96] P:1788.72 E:0.097034 |  latest as well to withdraw from the squad Shay Adams now a doubt as well we're actually going to hear
[3734.96 - 3739.84] P:1606.31 E:0.081710 |  from him straight after we have heard from Steve Clark. It's actually disappointing because you
[3739.84 - 3745.76] P:1104.48 E:0.088459 |  don't want to lose any players from the squad at Cairnti and Scott to good players playing to the
[3745.76 - 3750.80] P:1082.62 E:0.094084 |  best of their ability but as I always say injuries are sent to test you there's now a chance for
[3750.80 - 3755.60] P:957.09 E:0.101236 |  someone else. One or two missing from training this morning we've got some kind of virus in the
[3755.60 - 3760.00] P:1097.71 E:0.108793 |  camp just sickness so when the Dyches Shay Adams couldn't train this morning they didn't feel very
[3760.00 - 3765.76] P:936.54 E:0.088984 |  well but they'll be on the plane so we've got that to worry about as well so we're not short of
[3765.76 - 3771.60] P:1078.66 E:0.100921 |  issues and we're also not short of determination to go there and finish the job. Now I feel great
[3772.00 - 3776.88] P:1013.04 E:0.081639 |  you know I trained this morning and feeling better but I think it's just that you know it's one of
[3776.88 - 3783.36] P:698.89 E:0.085253 |  them mornings where we have to get through it and so I can play I think yeah I think if it was
[3783.36 - 3788.64] P:731.95 E:0.085808 |  any worse than that I think I couldn't but you know I'm fit and I'm ready to go. Yeah there's been a
[3788.64 - 3794.40] P:575.37 E:0.092228 |  few injuries you know but I think that's that comes from boys putting their bodies on the line and
[3794.40 - 3798.48] P:602.72 E:0.093112 |  you know wanting to do well for the nation so I think yeah it's been tough but you know
[3799.36 - 3805.44] P:735.92 E:0.090610 |  brought some other players in and I think we've had a good two games in this campaign and I think
[3805.44 - 3811.12] P:708.85 E:0.106545 |  we just have to end it well now I think you know everyone wants to do well and everyone show how
[3811.12 - 3815.92] P:1149.38 E:0.097456 |  good we are as a team so it's just you know getting over that final line tomorrow. So those are the
[3815.92 - 3821.12] P:1869.30 E:0.085866 |  thoughts of the Scotland striker Shay Adams before him the manager Steve Clark Pat do you think
[3821.12 - 3825.84] P:1659.79 E:0.094638 |  there'll be a temptation given the players missing and given the fact that a point is enough
[3826.48 - 3831.84] P:1441.72 E:0.079938 |  to sit back and play for the point? I think he might be tempted to try and play three at the back
[3832.40 - 3838.72] P:1429.98 E:0.083325 |  problem is he's not got three it's a real difficult inform but he'll really have to think
[3838.72 - 3842.56] P:1615.62 E:0.071685 |  imaginatively but that's one thing that Steve Clark's good at he's had to adapt it and time's
[3842.56 - 3847.04] P:1456.80 E:0.089333 |  gone past and it's kind of worked so you know I'm really intrigued to know what he's going to do
[3847.04 - 3855.68] P:1788.48 E:0.059626 |  system wise personnel wise and I could almost not guess just now. Pat and Ali and Joel
[3855.68 - 3862.64] P:1349.57 E:0.062503 |  here more from them from seven o'clock tomorrow all the build-up and then the game in full with us
[3862.64 - 3868.64] P:1742.97 E:0.069763 |  one other football line not the first time that I've said this on Five Lives Sport. Watford have
[3868.64 - 3876.40] P:1810.30 E:0.062729 |  a new manager Slamm and Billage has signed an 18 month deal after Rob Edwards was the latest one
[3876.40 - 3884.96] P:1755.84 E:0.069220 |  to be sacked by the club we will have reaction to tonight's England game on the football daily
[3884.96 - 3889.76] P:1761.60 E:0.064691 |  podcast which you'll be able to download later on via BBC Sands and don't forget the rugby
[3889.76 - 3896.16] P:1655.90 E:0.072744 |  union weekly one will be up a little bit later on we're waiting for the second half to get underway
[3896.16 - 3901.68] P:1684.44 E:0.084642 |  at Wembley, Goalless at halftime, Andros Tansen what do you want to see more of in the second half?
[3904.32 - 3910.96] P:1254.54 E:0.089906 |  Definitely more in the final third more creativity more linking up but I think like Chris said earlier
[3910.96 - 3914.96] P:1048.84 E:0.085892 |  we've created the chances created four or five good chances just the final ball needs to be a
[3914.96 - 3919.04] P:1366.17 E:0.091532 |  bit more clinical when you're playing the low block you know you're not going to get that many
[3919.04 - 3924.56] P:1806.34 E:0.079216 |  chances but when you do get in the final third you need to make it count. Would you switch the
[3924.56 - 3931.28] P:1642.22 E:0.093953 |  wide men round Andros at all so they're playing on their natural side? No I think they're more
[3931.28 - 3936.48] P:1517.70 E:0.087364 |  comfortable I know nowadays the left footer plays on the right and the right footer plays on the
[3936.48 - 3940.56] P:1559.58 E:0.084677 |  left so I think they're both comfortable where they are they're both creating it's just I know it's
[3940.56 - 3945.12] P:1551.99 E:0.097990 |  rich it's very rich coming from me but it's just the the final ball is just that end product which
[3945.12 - 3953.68] P:1701.70 E:0.075615 |  is missing. So you've heard from Andros Chris is alongside him second half maybe has just got
[3953.68 - 3959.84] P:1681.38 E:0.081642 |  underway cool I don't want to miss a second of this sorry John Murray. He's very naughty isn't
[3960.24 - 3967.60] P:1306.21 E:0.098656 |  Mark Chapman. Second half begins here at Wembley Stadium on this dry September night England 0
[3967.60 - 3974.08] P:1638.60 E:0.091118 |  Germany 0. Germans have made a change Timo Werner once of Chelsea is onto the field now he's taken
[3974.08 - 3980.00] P:1474.28 E:0.087674 |  the place of Jonas Hoffman who was quite quiet I must say on the right hand side so Werner who's
[3980.00 - 3984.32] P:1581.19 E:0.096401 |  done well actually since he's gone back to RB Leipzig this season has already scored four goals
[3984.32 - 3987.44] P:1660.39 E:0.099874 |  Werner is on we'll just see where he's going to play if he's going to play through the middle
[3987.44 - 3994.00] P:1531.18 E:0.090091 |  which I suspect he will as Germany win a free kick inside their own penalty area he is isn't
[3994.00 - 3997.36] P:1563.37 E:0.101234 |  he Chris Sutton he's he's got the number nine on his back and he's playing through the middle
[3997.36 - 4005.36] P:1503.37 E:0.085132 |  up front Werner. Yeah and Havards just dropping into that number 10 roll towards the Germans
[4005.92 - 4010.72] P:1585.92 E:0.092591 |  and they're getting onto that ball and Werner backing in but like why winning it wouldn't that
[4010.72 - 4015.12] P:1515.73 E:0.093682 |  have been a lovely had England scored after 10 seconds and Chapman would have missed it.
[4015.84 - 4023.28] P:1639.44 E:0.088159 |  Well they didn't so England in the red shirts with the the blue trim this is the new the new
[4023.28 - 4029.36] P:1592.11 E:0.094870 |  kit with the the old style collar the navy blue collar and Germany in the white shirts big black

[4033.68 - 4038.56] P:1536.47 E:0.099549 |  second half England playing from right to left as they did when they scored the two goals here at

[4045.76 - 4051.36] P:1445.75 E:0.084763 |  against England. That's really bad from Luke Shaw the Shaw left wing back Declan Rice
[4052.24 - 4058.24] P:1483.37 E:0.093975 |  he got a long 40-yard ball from the centre of the pitch to Shaw who made a run in behind but
[4058.24 - 4064.80] P:1566.05 E:0.085276 |  he's looking across the line the German back line that's really poor. People haven't rushed back to
[4064.80 - 4069.12] P:1316.39 E:0.102774 |  their seats for the start of the second half still lots and lots of empty red seats people still
[4069.12 - 4074.88] P:1553.47 E:0.092716 |  coming in the exit the entrances and here is Werner for Germany square from him Kimmich Kimmich
[4074.88 - 4079.12] P:1772.91 E:0.103315 |  is onto this 30 yards out slips the ball through the Muziala he's got some space right side of the
[4079.12 - 4083.44] P:1693.46 E:0.097620 |  penalty area he pulls it back to the edge of the box but he pulls it straight to his young friend
[4083.44 - 4088.56] P:1562.89 E:0.108027 |  Jude Bellingham and Bellingham for England passes it forward quickly to Sterling and now Cain return
[4088.56 - 4093.36] P:1449.21 E:0.110153 |  pass to Sterling. Sterling's got away from Zula but the Germans are getting back in numbers Sterling
[4093.36 - 4097.52] P:1278.21 E:0.105286 |  on the left hand side puts his foot on the ball actually and now the Germans are all back in
[4097.52 - 4101.84] P:1292.55 E:0.108431 |  position and groans you can hear it from the England supporters and we'll run you through the teams
[4101.84 - 4107.68] P:1163.86 E:0.097804 |  again when we get a chance but England with it still inside German territory and the ball
[4107.68 - 4111.92] P:1158.34 E:0.104420 |  forwards towards Bellingham who plays it out to the right hand side Rhys James is there
[4111.92 - 4115.36] P:1229.02 E:0.099173 |  Bellingham again with a touch that's away from Fulton though and I think it will be
[4116.00 - 4120.40] P:1253.51 E:0.100515 |  taken up by Germany deep inside their own half it is with the back run. I think the
[4120.40 - 4124.96] P:1518.81 E:0.098142 |  frustration there for the England support and I get that is Sterling actually turned back
[4126.24 - 4132.56] P:1481.11 E:0.085959 |  when he had the run on Zula had the opportunity to go for goal but didn't back himself turned back
[4132.56 - 4138.00] P:1632.18 E:0.090804 |  and the chance was gone. England with Fulton he has been bright in the match Phil Fulton he's done
[4138.00 - 4142.64] P:1669.84 E:0.102213 |  a lot of good things now the ball square across the edge of the box to Sterling should Spurt
[4142.64 - 4148.48] P:1560.24 E:0.094353 |  test Deggan diving to his left is able to catch it actually leaping to his left. Yeah and it's a
[4148.48 - 4155.12] P:1439.49 E:0.089910 |  good run from Luke Shaw on the overlap and Kera just backs off because he's thinking about going
[4155.12 - 4160.24] P:1467.73 E:0.096657 |  with Shaw that allowed Sterling to come inside on his right foot and try to bend the ball into the
[4160.24 - 4166.00] P:1551.47 E:0.090365 |  far corner but smart goalkeeping. Germany it is now coming forward still nil and a nil on five live
[4166.00 - 4175.04] P:1536.83 E:0.075789 |  and BBC sounds ball out to the right hand side and Tilo Kera of West Ham playing the ball back
[4175.04 - 4180.40] P:1641.32 E:0.093487 |  towards the halfway line. England had to make a change during the first half blow from Manchester
[4180.40 - 4187.20] P:1455.98 E:0.089454 |  City John Stones seeming to have pulled a hamstring so he was replaced by Kyle Walker that's the only
[4187.20 - 4192.00] P:1725.15 E:0.091030 |  England change so far balls played over the top for Werner Werner Flix a foot in it but lifts it
[4192.00 - 4198.48] P:1606.51 E:0.080632 |  high over and in any case the offside flag is up against the blonde German number nine so the
[4198.48 - 4204.88] P:1517.61 E:0.090865 |  England team now Pope and goal Walker Dyer and Maguire are the three central defenders James on
[4204.88 - 4210.16] P:1586.14 E:0.090370 |  the right Shaw on the left Bellingham and Rice in the middle Foden and Sterling either side of Ken
[4210.16 - 4216.96] P:1561.49 E:0.098541 |  and the German team with Tess Deggan in goal as England have given it away to Muziala and Muziala
[4216.96 - 4223.92] P:1586.16 E:0.099220 |  takes on K and Maguire Muziala went down in the box there seemed to be contact and must say from
[4224.00 - 4230.16] P:1616.39 E:0.103399 |  my view here but the referee Danny Macaulay waved it away straight away who's having none of that in
[4230.16 - 4236.08] P:1794.30 E:0.101072 |  terms of it being a penalty well it's how much contact I've got to say my initial feeling was
[4236.08 - 4243.04] P:1722.73 E:0.084026 |  penalty there was enough contact for Muziala to go down balls out of the play now so the question
[4243.04 - 4247.60] P:1497.21 E:0.086998 |  is whether they're going to have a look at this on the AR they've got to look at this got to Muziala
[4247.60 - 4254.16] P:1672.02 E:0.089712 |  stands Maguire up little step over I mean Maguire catches him has to be a penalty it's clumsy
[4254.16 - 4259.60] P:1713.52 E:0.095902 |  defending from Maguire can't get his feet going that little step over there is contact here we are
[4259.60 - 4265.20] P:1601.67 E:0.098335 |  here we are it's Harry Maguire is going to concede a penalty here he kicked he kicked and caught
[4265.20 - 4270.72] P:1560.19 E:0.097362 |  Muziala on the on the ankle the ball had gone the referee is going across to have a look at the
[4270.72 - 4276.88] P:1513.41 E:0.097661 |  screen but the video assistant referee Paul van Virkel has called the referee over and this is
[4276.88 - 4281.28] P:1482.63 E:0.101018 |  an absolute certainty he's going to have a look at this and England are going to concede a penalty
[4281.28 - 4286.96] P:1560.30 E:0.094654 |  Harry Maguire is going to concede a penalty and there's the narrative for you right there absolutely
[4287.92 - 4294.24] P:1598.10 E:0.108611 |  it's unfortunate there's the rectangle from the referee booze from the crowd but he points to the
[4294.24 - 4301.60] P:1618.37 E:0.093817 |  penalty spot and Harry Maguire in the middle of the England half just lifts his hand to his face
[4301.60 - 4306.72] P:1614.66 E:0.095953 |  and walks back to his own penalty area the England players go across Declan Rice is going to have a
[4306.72 - 4311.52] P:1632.35 E:0.098246 |  word Harry Kane as well but it's no good the decision's been given Harry Kane just shepherds
[4311.52 - 4315.84] P:1510.33 E:0.096869 |  race away but it's a penalty and it's Ilkai Gundawan who's got the ball in his hands
[4316.88 - 4323.12] P:1610.14 E:0.101769 |  yeah and it's just Maguire who gives the ball away to Muziala plays a little square ball Maguire
[4323.12 - 4332.56] P:1712.51 E:0.091222 |  tries to find short Muziala pinches the ball and drives up Maguire clumsy challenge there's a penalty
[4333.36 - 4333.68] P:1666.77 E:0.087283 |  and
[4336.32 - 4341.20] P:1647.95 E:0.103169 |  it's a poor poor error from Maguire what a chance for the Germans to take the lead
[4342.00 - 4346.72] P:1441.73 E:0.104679 |  well Gundawan has still got the ball in his hands and there's still general milling around
[4347.60 - 4355.44] P:1490.16 E:0.112668 |  but Harry Maguire is going to be the focus having been involved England losing possession Maguire
[4355.44 - 4361.44] P:1637.71 E:0.108308 |  involved in that then Maguire conceding the penalty so it's Nick Paul Newcastle United's Nick
[4361.44 - 4366.16] P:1650.14 E:0.108777 |  Paul dancing around on his line Ilkai Gundawan right footed slots it away
[4367.76 - 4374.24] P:1682.24 E:0.101789 |  Paul went down to his left but couldn't get that very good penalty by the Manchester City midfielder
[4374.88 - 4381.60] P:1599.44 E:0.100974 |  and England are behind at Wembley in this final match before they head to the World Cup and Cata
[4381.60 - 4387.84] P:1592.25 E:0.101103 |  England on this five-match run without a win a one-nil down to the Germans here at Wembley
[4388.64 - 4395.60] P:1644.54 E:0.095211 |  yeah good penalty from Gundawan Pope actually stands up I think he thinks Gundawan is going down
[4395.60 - 4403.76] P:1569.37 E:0.095164 |  the middle Gundawan just slides the ball into Pope's left hand side just looking at this challenge
[4403.76 - 4411.84] P:1607.42 E:0.092528 |  again from Maguire in your right John that's the narrative why does Garith Southgate persist
[4411.84 - 4418.40] P:1751.22 E:0.096484 |  with Harry Maguire doesn't get enough club football the ball passed from him initially
[4419.84 - 4421.84] P:1598.64 E:0.114771 |  it's going to be hung out to dry here isn't he
[4424.08 - 4429.04] P:1516.62 E:0.101761 |  well as a football manager you in metaphorical terms you live and die by your decisions
[4430.32 - 4433.76] P:1492.54 E:0.102038 |  and Harry Maguire and the Fray just conceded that penalty
[4435.44 - 4439.60] P:1587.71 E:0.116419 |  and Germany lead England by one goal to nil so now they have to respond
[4439.60 - 4445.44] P:1724.08 E:0.111055 |  England to a searching for a goal right to the left hand side shore curls it across chested
[4445.44 - 4449.68] P:1521.30 E:0.115010 |  down by Bellingham but it bounces away now there are big appeals for a handball there from the
[4449.68 - 4454.48] P:1660.50 E:0.110886 |  England players Kane and Bellingham are saying that it struck a German arm the referee's having
[4454.48 - 4459.84] P:1662.76 E:0.109903 |  nothing to do with that either he's leaving that to be a R England come forward again but concede a
[4459.84 - 4467.68] P:1518.19 E:0.104120 |  free kick so this is a question of whether Paul van Buurkel is going to call the referee to have
[4467.76 - 4472.32] P:1569.61 E:0.096338 |  a look at that must say with the naked eye it wasn't obvious but we are now seeing it Chris
[4472.96 - 4479.04] P:1508.59 E:0.085884 |  as the ball came into the box oh it's uh it's Bellingham and round I don't say handball yeah
[4479.04 - 4486.80] P:1674.43 E:0.083376 |  there's no handball I think the England forwards clutching their wanting a decision which
[4488.16 - 4493.76] P:1721.44 E:0.094978 |  clearly wasn't there but now England they've sat in first half haven't they encountered
[4493.84 - 4497.28] P:1722.63 E:0.095664 |  got to take some initiative and take the game to Germany
[4498.88 - 4505.92] P:1682.76 E:0.094343 |  they have a precious situation in the nation's league this game that is effectively a dead
[4505.92 - 4511.28] P:1617.90 E:0.091137 |  rubber really as the balls played back to pulp who clears long towards the halfway line in the
[4511.28 - 4516.00] P:1474.02 E:0.098636 |  context of the nation's league there's really very little resting on this match England have already
[4516.00 - 4522.40] P:1602.16 E:0.093263 |  relegated Germany can't make the finals but it's important it's big for England this now it's big
[4522.48 - 4528.80] P:1625.19 E:0.093548 |  for England speak for Garis Southgate after his team selection Harry Maguire was at fault in the
[4528.80 - 4535.52] P:1515.41 E:0.094116 |  conceding of the opening goal here is Bellingham now Bellingham players have got to stand up to
[4535.52 - 4540.64] P:1663.63 E:0.110570 |  the moment stand up to the occasion Kane and Sterling there too are the most experienced men now the
[4540.64 - 4545.60] P:1678.71 E:0.103529 |  ball is Shaw on the left hand side Shaw in the full back position the German's quickly back in
[4545.60 - 4551.28] P:1599.85 E:0.100190 |  position now Rice receives it on the edge of the box gives it back to Sterling on the left hand side
[4551.28 - 4557.44] P:1546.44 E:0.102722 |  Sterling to Maguire Maguire looks up lifts a pass right over to the far side James takes that down
[4557.44 - 4562.40] P:1604.70 E:0.114998 |  James now approaching the penalty area on his right foot plays it to the edge of the box and Bellingham
[4563.12 - 4569.60] P:1624.97 E:0.100738 |  tried to curl a shot under the crossbar but lifted it over instead by a yard or two yeah it's funny
[4569.60 - 4575.28] P:1640.55 E:0.090967 |  isn't it the Germans take the lead and you know one of the first times in the game England then
[4575.28 - 4580.72] P:1665.63 E:0.091351 |  take the initiative a couple of good passages of players the balls fed out to the right hand side
[4580.72 - 4587.12] P:1782.01 E:0.088045 |  James feeds a lovely ball back to Bellingham from 18 yards out edge of the box should make
[4587.12 - 4595.28] P:1654.95 E:0.088735 |  Ter Stegen work full sails over the bar in the other match in this group Italy now lead two
[4595.28 - 4602.32] P:1680.88 E:0.107383 |  nil in Budapest in the Puskas arena against Hungary and it looks as though Italy Roberto Mancini's
[4602.32 - 4608.24] P:1704.95 E:0.102642 |  Italy who are not going to the World Cup are going to win this group and head to the finals next year
[4608.24 - 4614.88] P:1475.63 E:0.094305 |  the donations lead instead free kick sure Rice is fouled on the left hand side
[4614.88 - 4620.40] P:1588.03 E:0.088802 |  most teammate West Ham teammate Kara with the foul so it's a free kick set piece opportunity
[4621.04 - 4627.84] P:1628.51 E:0.085722 |  Harry Maguire an obvious target that would be that would turn the story on its head
[4628.88 - 4636.24] P:1622.70 E:0.084555 |  if he's able to get that big head to the ball and put this into the net so the free kick to be taken
[4636.72 - 4642.40] P:1628.86 E:0.097227 |  by James from the left hand side right footed he plays it in towards Ter Stegen but he got one
[4642.40 - 4647.76] P:1649.38 E:0.090648 |  of those big orange gloves to it and up a cut got a good distance on that with that punch
[4648.48 - 4651.84] P:1657.68 E:0.099234 |  caught that beautifully almost punched it to the halfway line
[4653.44 - 4660.40] P:1565.38 E:0.088084 |  England with Walker the substitute the first half substitute Manchester Derby coming on Sunday
[4660.40 - 4663.12] P:1635.08 E:0.110725 |  that's one of our commentaries from the Premier League this weekend
[4663.60 - 4668.64] P:1726.49 E:0.108964 |  England get the ball away down the right hand side with James James delays the cross and then
[4668.64 - 4672.96] P:1494.92 E:0.110117 |  just to win a corner strikes it straight into the defender and it's behind England corner
[4672.96 - 4678.40] P:1638.72 E:0.107640 |  he had the opportunity though Reese James to whip the ball in first time it's 2v2
[4678.96 - 4685.04] P:1668.02 E:0.095828 |  and Sterling inside the box German defenders running back towards the goal got a corner corner
[4685.76 - 4689.68] P:1676.14 E:0.110171 |  here's the delivery now to the near post it's a flick it bounces out belling him on the edge
[4689.68 - 4694.88] P:1568.40 E:0.094773 |  of the box shoots but he slipped the thing as he did so and hit a bouncing shot well wide of
[4694.88 - 4700.08] P:1552.78 E:0.088037 |  the right post as he looked at it just slips doesn't he belling him there a couple of decent
[4700.08 - 4705.76] P:1604.28 E:0.090942 |  opportunities there similar position to the one he ballooned over the bar it's not a great corner
[4705.76 - 4714.48] P:1527.93 E:0.086603 |  from Foden the ball for German defender just ricochets to him from 18 yards but that left
[4714.48 - 4722.48] P:1502.13 E:0.091298 |  standing foot slips and chance gone the score is England 0 Germany 1 an England facing the
[4722.48 - 4729.44] P:1476.05 E:0.090469 |  possibility of heading to the World Cup on a six match unbeaten run that would be the first time
[4729.44 - 4734.88] P:1528.97 E:0.092025 |  that England have gone six matches without a win for 29 years
[4735.12 - 4742.16] P:1677.50 E:0.086476 |  Dyer playing the ball out from the back Sterling now short
[4742.80 - 4747.36] P:1568.88 E:0.095636 |  the flick but it bounces out of play off the Manchester United man for a throw in on the
[4747.36 - 4754.16] P:1459.86 E:0.095765 |  halfway line it was Federico de Marco who scored the second goal for Italy hungry nil Italy 2
[4755.04 - 4759.20] P:1502.23 E:0.100316 |  so not that it England or Germany or bothered but that's Netherlands Croatia
[4760.16 - 4764.32] P:1544.14 E:0.105453 |  it looks like Italy and either Portugal or Spain will be the four teams through to the
[4765.12 - 4769.68] P:1502.03 E:0.113904 |  the nation's league finals next year rice puts in the challenge but Verna comes out with the ball
[4769.68 - 4774.40] P:1644.48 E:0.108999 |  there's a slip in the box by Dyer and Verna couldn't find the pass across the penalty area
[4775.04 - 4781.28] P:1609.07 E:0.096946 |  and Sané was all alone almost at the far post but but Verna couldn't find the pass and that's a
[4781.28 - 4787.76] P:1562.05 E:0.099447 |  let-off for England and Garis Southgate could easily have been 2-0 terrible from Timo wasn't it
[4787.76 - 4793.92] P:1601.49 E:0.098202 |  I mean that was impossible to miss that pass the Germans would have been 2-0 and it was awful
[4793.92 - 4800.24] P:1730.30 E:0.088772 |  the way he just fed the ball I think it was to Dyer with two German attackers free just to tap
[4800.24 - 4806.24] P:1603.06 E:0.097077 |  the ball in Dyer slipped as well at the crucial moment and he was fortunate England were fortunate
[4806.24 - 4813.36] P:1502.78 E:0.096392 |  Germany lead 1-0 half an hour to play half an hour for England to salvage this against Germany
[4814.32 - 4819.76] P:1464.03 E:0.100472 |  German supporters over there boyant they'll be enjoying this question is which of these teams
[4820.40 - 4825.04] P:1530.35 E:0.098780 |  would go to the World Cup off the back of a morale boosting win at the moment it's Hansy Flicks
[4825.04 - 4829.44] P:1577.19 E:0.111488 |  Germany and here they come again and there's a low shot from the edge of the box from Zula the
[4829.44 - 4834.16] P:1570.82 E:0.102956 |  central defender who did well exchange the pass around the edge of the penalty area and then try
[4834.16 - 4838.64] P:1578.58 E:0.100746 |  to pass it into the bottom corner but hit it a couple of feet wide yeah he's comfortable though
[4838.64 - 4845.84] P:1749.57 E:0.091905 |  Zula when he steps in gonna sit little pass in I think it's the Musiala who's wonderful waited
[4845.84 - 4852.40] P:1695.86 E:0.090639 |  cushion pass back to him allows him to take another touch and he's under pressure but fires a shot
[4852.40 - 4858.08] P:1678.55 E:0.099709 |  not far away from Nick Popes right hand post England have lost possession again they've given it away
[4858.08 - 4862.00] P:1565.14 E:0.094671 |  inside their own half Gundau and then the Gwaiar puts in the challenge and the ball bounces away
[4862.00 - 4867.44] P:1592.03 E:0.095709 |  to Sterling near the halfway line who bounces off Kaira but Havertz is able to pick it up
[4867.44 - 4872.40] P:1583.32 E:0.084581 |  and Germany have just got a they've got an extra spring at the moment they've got the goal
[4872.40 - 4877.44] P:1513.67 E:0.092224 |  they're a goal ahead and they just have the edge over England this is where yeah they're gonna make
[4877.44 - 4883.04] P:1511.69 E:0.091345 |  some subs on the England but this is where England and Garith Thaisgate you feel the team have to be
[4883.04 - 4889.92] P:1485.05 E:0.089229 |  brave and really press the Germans high if England just sit in and the Germans dominate
[4889.92 - 4895.36] P:1518.59 E:0.092666 |  possession then you can see it getting ugly in here yeah you can now Pukaj or Sackare can see
[4896.08 - 4900.08] P:1550.43 E:0.106114 |  is being prepared to come on remember Jack Grealish is not an option Jack Grealish who came on at
[4900.08 - 4905.04] P:1388.61 E:0.093206 |  the Euros here and and helped it to win the game for England Grealish suspended for this match
[4905.04 - 4911.04] P:1385.79 E:0.090691 |  after his yellow card in the San Siro the other night and I think Jordan Henderson is being
[4911.04 - 4916.80] P:1416.28 E:0.103085 |  prepared down there as well Rice stretchers into the challenge Bellingham stretches into the challenge
[4916.80 - 4921.92] P:1586.67 E:0.107920 |  McGuire stretches into the challenge but Musiala gets away and gives it to Furner and Furner shoots
[4921.92 - 4927.76] P:1641.97 E:0.096847 |  low across the face of goal and beyond the far post and again England are fortunate well
[4928.56 - 4935.76] P:1664.44 E:0.095523 |  I'm lucky that chance felt to Timo Verna because he got the feeling because it's Timo Verna that he
[4935.76 - 4943.52] P:1712.68 E:0.080336 |  would miss but a couple of challenges from England players not good enough the ball slipped into
[4943.52 - 4948.80] P:1686.27 E:0.094777 |  Verna who has that pace to get away the England backline but then from 12 yards at the angle
[4948.80 - 4954.00] P:1690.23 E:0.086047 |  he's trying to slide the ball across Pope into the far corner it slides a couple of yards
[4954.80 - 4961.76] P:1662.01 E:0.078274 |  couple of yards wide of Nick Pope's post terrific from Musiala though I mean that was
[4962.40 - 4968.24] P:1539.79 E:0.093057 |  that was wonderful stuff he could easily have been playing for England tonight against Germany
[4968.24 - 4972.16] P:1641.03 E:0.095746 |  even though he you know he's born in Germany he was born in Stuttgart but moved to this country
[4972.16 - 4977.36] P:1392.43 E:0.092551 |  as a seven-year-old was at Southampton was at Chelsea actually met Gareth Southgate when he was
[4977.36 - 4981.68] P:1382.50 E:0.097492 |  13 or 14 years old when he was a schoolboy when Gareth Southgate came to his school
[4981.68 - 4988.64] P:1690.54 E:0.088399 |  well we can't hold that against Gareth that's wonderful but real talent said it was a really
[4988.64 - 4992.96] P:1606.92 E:0.090827 |  tough decision but he came through the groups your friend Derek Ray put out a picture this
[4992.96 - 4999.20] P:1458.35 E:0.096908 |  afternoon with Bellingham and and Musiala sitting alongside each other in an England dressing room
[4999.20 - 5004.56] P:1416.22 E:0.094451 |  one of the young teams but Musiala he won the penalty tonight and he very nearly set Verna up
[5004.56 - 5012.56] P:1400.98 E:0.083783 |  for the second goal where England nil Germany won England needs something and Gareth Southgate
[5012.56 - 5019.12] P:1304.18 E:0.084183 |  going to make a couple of changes it's Mason Mount who is coming on with Pocayo Saka they thought
[5019.12 - 5024.24] P:1211.18 E:0.101126 |  saw Jordan Henderson standing up but he's not he's not coming on just yet if he is going to come on
[5025.12 - 5032.32] P:1447.33 E:0.089560 |  so uh two of the two of the players who've been real Gareth Southgate men hadn't they Saka and Mount
[5032.32 - 5038.08] P:1414.32 E:0.088255 |  if this this England team are going to be called on to see if they can help turn things around here's
[5038.08 - 5042.80] P:1544.10 E:0.094629 |  Eric Dyer at the back but Dyer's pasted straight the kinect and kinect chips it over the top Nick
[5042.80 - 5048.24] P:1675.61 E:0.107019 |  Popes come right to the edge of his box and clears it away and they left it to one another Walker
[5048.24 - 5052.56] P:1579.21 E:0.108046 |  and Pope and Pope in the end it didn't cross the line into the box and Pope cleared it but at the
[5052.56 - 5058.16] P:1622.39 E:0.094782 |  other end Foden plays it up but it bounces off Sterling and Germany will come again in the centre
[5058.16 - 5063.20] P:1515.44 E:0.104310 |  circle with the goal scorer Gundawan but he loses out in centrefield is club mate Thoden came back
[5063.20 - 5068.56] P:1470.44 E:0.084633 |  and tackled it Bellingham now to the right hand side I think that German goal the Gundawan penalty
[5069.20 - 5077.28] P:1519.48 E:0.085493 |  is actually making it a better game it is uh that was a nerfy moment for Nick Pope
[5078.56 - 5085.44] P:1573.86 E:0.094870 |  really indecisive there expecting the ball to run through to him and side is 18 yard box and then
[5085.44 - 5091.12] P:1605.36 E:0.094026 |  in the end a hacked clearance away Eric Dyer goes for a long diagonal pass down the right hand side
[5091.12 - 5095.04] P:1552.53 E:0.100625 |  to James he gets the ball under control immediately near the corner of the penalty area plays it in
[5095.04 - 5099.84] P:1517.21 E:0.100498 |  square but played it in short that was read so easily by Gundawan now it's headed forward though for
[5099.84 - 5104.48] P:1606.42 E:0.099870 |  Walker for England Harry Kane turns on the right hand side slips the ball down the right hand side
[5104.48 - 5110.56] P:1627.62 E:0.101751 |  it's clipped across to the near post bit headed behind by Schrotterbeck who was comfortably in the
[5110.56 - 5114.48] P:1425.26 E:0.107174 |  right area to head it behind and it's a corner to England from the right I don't think I'll make the
[5114.48 - 5119.84] P:1510.21 E:0.105187 |  double change yet but it's corner yeah it's really clean play from Harry Kane to slide the ball to
[5119.84 - 5126.56] P:1687.71 E:0.098215 |  Reese James but he's cross blocked can England make something Harry McGuire is calling for it
[5126.56 - 5132.00] P:1594.52 E:0.093044 |  McGuire and Kane standing together Thoden with the corner into the near post it's a flick and it's up
[5132.00 - 5137.28] P:1630.02 E:0.093497 |  and over the near post by Eric Dyer and it's a goal kick to Germany England are going to make a
[5137.28 - 5147.52] P:1658.23 E:0.099282 |  double substitution now. Well, Thoden is replaced Saka and Mount coming on
[5150.72 - 5157.76] P:1655.43 E:0.098996 |  and Raheem Sterling so Sterling and Thoden are off and Saka and Mount are on well
[5159.28 - 5163.60] P:1716.88 E:0.109225 |  well they sought themselves out let's bring in Andros Townsend for a word we're almost halfway
[5163.60 - 5168.48] P:1722.65 E:0.084511 |  through the second half Andros yeah I think the introduction of Timo Verna has completely
[5168.48 - 5173.28] P:1593.09 E:0.087108 |  changed the dynamic of this German front three we've said at half time how comfortable England
[5173.28 - 5178.16] P:1599.43 E:0.087259 |  were not really troubled and then you get someone like Verna with his pace and his willingness to
[5178.16 - 5182.88] P:1486.36 E:0.092732 |  run behind you get him stretching defences and all of a sudden even though he's not having joy
[5182.88 - 5187.04] P:1434.54 E:0.084278 |  himself he's stretching the defense and allowing the more technical players in behind him to get on
[5187.04 - 5192.88] P:1522.95 E:0.081551 |  the ball so yeah his introduction has really really hurt England. Thank you Andros England
[5192.88 - 5201.36] P:1510.61 E:0.077541 |  nailed Germany one BBC Radio 5 live 25 minutes to go what do you think Chris Thoden, Thoden and
[5201.36 - 5208.64] P:1623.55 E:0.096102 |  Sterling off? Yeah a little bit surprised. There's Harry Maguire left side of the penalty area
[5208.64 - 5213.52] P:1689.09 E:0.106893 |  Maguire still going between two Germans still going but then the challenge comes in on him and
[5213.52 - 5219.84] P:1699.02 E:0.097729 |  Maguire is dispossessed trying to rectify matters Havertz plays it forward to Verna Verna now Zane
[5220.00 - 5224.16] P:1598.16 E:0.102201 |  in the middle Verna still in possession 30 yards out he's on his right foot he plays it square to
[5224.16 - 5229.68] P:1695.51 E:0.109591 |  Havertz just outside the D a curling left foot shot it's in it's beyond the dive of Nick Pope
[5230.24 - 5237.68] P:1664.43 E:0.112797 |  Havertz scores and Germany lead here by two goals to nil and Garros Southgate stands on the edge
[5237.68 - 5243.76] P:1685.19 E:0.100774 |  of the coaching area it's going to be a defeat it seems to send England to the World Cup it's going
[5243.76 - 5252.32] P:1641.98 E:0.096361 |  to be six matches without a win and it's going to be another Nations League defeat damaging very
[5252.32 - 5261.84] P:1619.69 E:0.093214 |  damaging this terrible Nations League campaign and Germany now celebrate that goal that well taken
[5261.84 - 5270.48] P:1576.58 E:0.091019 |  goal from Kai Havertz black red and yellow flags flying in one corner of a very quiet Wembley stadium
[5270.48 - 5278.88] P:1582.27 E:0.099291 |  the rest of it extremely subdued England nil Germany to dare I say it was Harry Maguire who
[5278.88 - 5285.68] P:1648.97 E:0.097056 |  gave the ball away driving forward from England's left hand side cutting inside is dispossessed
[5285.68 - 5295.44] P:1660.52 E:0.095949 |  and the Germans break a great pace and as Verna with the ball across the box to Kai Havertz who's
[5295.44 - 5302.56] P:1774.82 E:0.096908 |  still got so much to do but 20 yards out right hand side of the box with his left foot finds the
[5302.56 - 5310.40] P:1692.41 E:0.086436 |  far top corner it's a brilliant finish the howitzer from Havertz into the far corner Pope no chance
[5311.12 - 5318.24] P:1684.29 E:0.087004 |  no way back for England another Maguire mistake and I sense it's going to get ugly in here
[5319.76 - 5325.12] P:1516.26 E:0.094222 |  midway through the second half here at Wembley Stadium Garros Southgate and his England team
[5325.20 - 5330.88] P:1553.76 E:0.095089 |  heading to another Nations League defeat England nil Germany to and for the remainder he is Ian
[5330.88 - 5337.44] P:1619.97 E:0.089320 |  Dennis thank you John so a double change being made there with Robin Goosens coming on and Serge
[5337.44 - 5344.96] P:1672.27 E:0.088608 |  Gnabry so Goosens replacing round at left back and Gnabry coming on for Sane on the left hand side
[5344.96 - 5350.88] P:1652.10 E:0.092771 |  for Germany as England looking for a way back into the game with a final quarter of this match
[5350.88 - 5360.72] P:1587.20 E:0.088191 |  remaining but trading 2-0 and a bad night for Harry Maguire culpable with both of the goals
[5361.60 - 5366.48] P:1542.44 E:0.094922 |  he gave away the first and then trying to win it back conceded the penalty and then losing the
[5366.48 - 5371.44] P:1651.61 E:0.101704 |  ball in the Germany half and then within a matter of seconds a fine curling effort as
[5371.44 - 5377.28] P:1748.38 E:0.103852 |  Bellingham shoots from distance but just outside the D as England all in red play from right to
[5377.28 - 5384.72] P:1704.85 E:0.084808 |  left right footed well positioned and a comfortable save for for Andre to Steggen it's a bit of
[5384.72 - 5391.68] P:1607.40 E:0.092448 |  sod's law for Harry Maguire isn't it the Havertz finish was so good such a brilliant effort to
[5391.68 - 5398.72] P:1669.71 E:0.085853 |  but the Germans 2-0 ahead you know normally from that range you've got to be perfect and Havertz was
[5398.72 - 5406.80] P:1620.50 E:0.081923 |  perfect and it's you know he can do no right can he Harry Maguire everything which he does at this
[5406.80 - 5414.48] P:1589.72 E:0.094678 |  moment in time is under so much scrutiny he gives the ball away on the edge of the German box and
[5414.48 - 5421.44] P:1580.70 E:0.094199 |  the Germans end up scoring blindly but England so far in this second half they haven't really had
[5422.08 - 5427.92] P:1607.25 E:0.098438 |  a passage of play where they actually look like scoring a couple of efforts from Bellingham
[5427.92 - 5434.16] P:1687.39 E:0.086687 |  on the edge of the box immediately after the Germans had scored took a bit of the initiative
[5434.16 - 5441.20] P:1648.44 E:0.105071 |  but now this is where you sense that England need to be brave here is Mason now picking up a loose
[5441.20 - 5445.04] P:1734.12 E:0.099660 |  ball on the left hand side and running forward goes down the left side of the penalty area
[5446.32 - 5453.04] P:1717.25 E:0.098144 |  scoops the ball in towards Harry Kane six yards out cleared away by Schlotterbeck the fair-haired
[5453.04 - 5462.00] P:1694.20 E:0.084572 |  central defender for Germany but it's over 560 minutes now England without a goal in open play
[5462.96 - 5470.80] P:1681.16 E:0.083982 |  they really have toiled of late in terms of creating opportunities they failed to score in
[5470.80 - 5476.16] P:1721.63 E:0.087910 |  four of their last five that goal against Germany in that 1-1 draw earlier on in the nation's
[5476.16 - 5482.16] P:1632.91 E:0.089592 |  late campaign was a penalty a sack of turns on the halfway line on the right back towards Rice
[5484.08 - 5489.04] P:1654.90 E:0.098868 |  as Rice runs forward and now towards Maguire he lays it off first time and we have under 19 minutes
[5489.04 - 5493.68] P:1761.98 E:0.090177 |  remaining with with you through until 10 o'clock tonight on five live sport we'll try and bring
[5493.68 - 5499.44] P:1724.93 E:0.086986 |  you as much reaction as we can down in the in the tunnel with John no doubt speaking to garris
[5499.44 - 5505.36] P:1723.22 E:0.098441 |  southgate and the number of the players has reached James forward ball Saka onto it right hand side
[5505.36 - 5510.64] P:1814.64 E:0.110156 |  back towards James James with a right footed cross comes out towards Shaw down into the ground
[5510.64 - 5517.36] P:1854.25 E:0.115090 |  it's cross the line surely goal is given and England have a goal back and it is Luke short
[5517.36 - 5524.00] P:1803.08 E:0.114310 |  to reduce the areas hope for England England one Germany two do you know what do you know what
[5524.00 - 5530.32] P:1750.47 E:0.111618 |  that stems from Jude Bellingham inside his own half being really brave on the ball is under pressure
[5530.32 - 5537.12] P:1779.74 E:0.097358 |  from three German attackers maneuvers the ball outright and then the ball is crossing England
[5537.12 - 5541.44] P:1778.76 E:0.102947 |  load the box for attackers in there goes all the way through to shore at the far post
[5542.08 - 5547.36] P:1724.24 E:0.099505 |  who takes a touch off his chest and chokes the ball down goes through test against legs
[5548.16 - 5556.88] P:1671.38 E:0.088351 |  and just over the line England showing a bit of character a bit of spirit back in this 21
[5556.88 - 5562.32] P:1653.68 E:0.102401 |  always concerned when the game doesn't immediately restart but it now does they must have been
[5562.32 - 5571.04] P:1644.44 E:0.104759 |  having a look at that for the AR for for something but after a delay it is to want an England now
[5573.04 - 5579.68] P:1637.97 E:0.100760 |  it's a stoppage in play and Luke short one of the players who's been questioned about being in
[5579.68 - 5584.72] P:1739.31 E:0.095147 |  the starting 11 only two Premier League starts from Manchester United only three appearances
[5584.72 - 5592.08] P:1548.63 E:0.089219 |  all season for Eric Tenhard with his third goal for his country this is first was against
[5592.08 - 5597.44] P:1359.18 E:0.100915 |  Italy in the Euro final there's a Germany player down let's have a word with Andrews Townsend
[5597.44 - 5601.44] P:1548.55 E:0.099450 |  our guest hitting out on five live sport sets us up for an interesting finale now doesn't it
[5602.00 - 5606.96] P:1287.22 E:0.095888 |  yeah it does and England have obviously had to be more adventurous since Germany scored their goal
[5606.96 - 5612.08] P:1262.44 E:0.084503 |  we've had to come out more brought on more attacking players and like Chris said in commentary
[5612.64 - 5616.08] P:1368.25 E:0.095095 |  Jude Bellingham a bit of adventure he drove full with the ball and he made
[5616.88 - 5620.16] P:1471.05 E:0.093101 |  he made the opening happen for us to get our first goal but now it's going to be interesting we've
[5620.24 - 5626.00] P:1521.90 E:0.092164 |  got 20 odd minutes to really throw some bodies forward and see if we can break this German resolve
[5626.56 - 5631.20] P:1818.11 E:0.100357 |  and what about whilst there's still the treatment going on to I think it's Kimmich who's getting
