 Just on the way at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea Liverpool, Pat Nevin and John Murray. Yes, Chelsea in possession. Long ball down the right-hand side for Pedro Neto to chase, but Van Dijk gets there. Just gives it back to Mamadash Vili, making his Premier League debut, Pat Nevin. Not sure about that. I don't think he much... However, he got rid of it. He did, but he took on his left foot, he should have taken on his right foot, and it gave Charles Pedro a chance to get very, very close to him, but having seen Mamadash Vili quite a few times on the national side, he is a top quality goalkeeper. Certainly as a shortstopper, we're going to find out how good he is. Yes, very, very able replacement, though, coming in for the injured, Alison. So Chelsea, Nill, Liverpool, Nill. Here at Stamford Bridge, where the smoke from the pre-match fireworks has cleared, although we can still smell them in the air, as Gravenbuck just put a foot in there and caught Fernandez. And Fernandez gets to his feet and looks quite angrily at referee Anthony Taylor, who allowed play to continue, but I think we had a good view of that, Pat, and he did catch him on the side of the ankle. As Bradley plays one forward, now four, Liverpool at the top of Sopo's lie, and then Rees-James is in position to chest it back to his goalkeeper, Sanchez. Just a little bit of a change of system, which also today, is very unusual to see such an adaptation. I thought Gusto was going to play right full back. It's not, as James is playing now. Gusto's playing a forward attacking air. So Chelsea are playing a 4-1-4-1 to start the game off. Yeah, with Gusto in this advanced position, and Rees-James has the right back. So Sanchez in goal, James at right back, Atchampong and Baddi Ashil, the two central defenders with Chalabar suspended after he was one of the three players, who've been sent off in the last four matches. Cucaraya at left back, then Caissado in the midfield, as Liverpool played forward, and out to the left-hand side. Now Gatpo into the penalty area tries to cross it, but it's blocked well by the teenager Atchampong, who get across quickly and was able to block it away, and Chelsea are able to clear it to the halfway line, where Pedro Neto concedes a foul, so free kick to Liverpool, who take it quickly. Anthony Taylor allows them to do that. Gatpo just keeps it in on the left-hand side. Gatpo in the full back position against Gusto, who's dropped back in there now. Then back to the edge of the penalty area, McAllister has challenged, good challenge from Enzo Fernandez, still bounces into the Chelsea penalty area. Gatpo back to the left-hand side, here's the cross. No, Salah was challenged by Cucaraya, who just got a touch on that, and was able to clear it away. Chelsea under some pressure from Liverpool here. It is the FIFA Club World Champions against the Premier League champions. So lots of trophy pedigree, lots of gold badges around the place, and Liverpool with the ball in the centre-circle. So yeah, the Chelsea forward-line pat, so Neto on the right-hand side, then Molo Gusto, then Enzo Fernandez, Garnaccio on the left, and João Pedro through the middle. Liverpool still attacking, there's a good start from them. And then into the penalty area, it comes, but too close to Sanchez, with McAllister making that burst forward. And the Liverpool team, Mamarash Villiangol, as we've mentioned. Bradley Canate, Van Dijk and Kierkes is the back four. Then Gravenberg, McAllister and Sopozlai in the advanced position again today, as opposed to right back. Salah and Gatpo in the wide positions. Alexander, Isaac through the middle, the new number nine, as Mamarash Villiangol receives the ball now from Canate, and the Liverpool goalkeeper can clear it to the halfway line. And Hugo Ekitike, incidentally, is among the substitutes, even though he had what was billed and said to be a thigh strain, McAllister's crossfield pass of Edg James, but also was hit too firmly and was out of play for a throw into Liverpool on the left. It's been a great start. So the game, real good test about it. Liverpool looking particularly dangerous down that left hand side. The try-out of the load, so it's not just those James, obviously the right full back just now. And they've got to that byline a couple of times, and both teams look to me as if they think the other sides of that week at the moment were going to go. Yeah, Pat Neven with us here, twice Chelsea player of the year, Scotland International, and we're sitting high here in the East Stand, watching Liverpool attack again. Gakpoch, couldn't quite get the pass to Sobozlai. Caesado brilliantly read that, actually. Sprinted forward, cut it out in classic Caesado style, and Chelsea are able to pass it back to the edge of their six-yard box. Excellent pace from this match, and on a slot so far, I would say Pat has got exactly what he wanted for a high tempo. A tempo start against Chelsea here, trying to take advantage of the fact that they have lost their last two Premier League games, and clearly there's a bit of edginess here at Stamford Bridge among the home sections. And of course there's history between these two teams as well, which adds to everything else that's on show, but of course Chelsea will keep the pace up, because Liverpool travelling a good distance over to Estam, though, there, and they had a hard night. Here's the chance. Here's one for it, for the ball to go to the edge of the penalty area, it ran away from him all the way through for a goal kick. Former Liverpool man Luis Díaz is scored for Bayern Munich after 14 seconds of their match against Eintracht Frankfurt, so Bayern Munich winning one nil away. Chelsea nil, Liverpool nil. We've heard, we just heard Bukaj Osaka a few moments ago, we've heard as well from Nuno Espírito Santo, we'll have more reaction to the three-o-clock kick-offs at half-time in this match, but Chelsea, Casero, need it away, and actually Gravenberg stepped in, Liverpool have got it back. Now Gravenberg again in the centre-circle, a little pass round the outside of Fernandez to McAllister. Back to Gravenberg once more, Liverpool knocking it about really nicely in the early stages. Now Salah to Isak, who passed it behind Salah, actually did well to keep it in play in the end. Kukarere puts in the challenge, he's up for this, no doubt. Kukarere against Salah as Liverpool have it back again, with Bradley, Bradley to Gravenberg, who just stretches for it. Chelsea have got all 11 men behind the ball, how refreshing it is to see these two sides playing each other in their first-choice kits as well, as Neto then puts the challenge in, down in the full-back position this time, and it's out of play for a corner to Liverpool. No excuses for Chelsea, blue shirts, blue shorts, white socks against Liverpool all in red. That doesn't normally stop them. Yeah, nobody can try to sell your third shirt in a certain part of the season, usually just before Christmas. But lots of interesting things in this game. And the battle with Kukarere, certainly against Mo Salah, is one of many I'm already enjoying in this game. Just before Christmas. Here's the corner for Liverpool, into the six-yard box, and Sanchez comes, gets a little touch on that with his fingertips, but Anthony Taylor says he spotted something in there, and he's given a free kick to Chelsea. He's repping before Christmas. No, I'm not saying it's just before Christmas just now. But no, it is a bit of a really interesting C-Q Karela against Salah and various other match-ups. But of course there's been a lot of talk during the week about the amount of goals that have been scored by both these sides from free kicks, from corner kicks, from all the different set pieces, and that maybe is the best chance that Anthony Taylor's had so far. Here's a grappling, a real wrestling match between Troll, Petrone, and Canate. It's then played over the top for Garnaccio to chase, but Mamadash, he was quickly out of his penalty area, and with his left hook was able to hike it out of play down the Chelsea left as they play from right to left, as we look from way up here in the first half on what is a sunny evening now. Christmas might be around the corner, Pat, but my goodness, what an autumnal day it was in London today, with the leaves swirling around in the aftermath of Storm Amy. Has Chelsea had it with James? What about... What's the thinking here with James and Gusto, do you think? Well, James will play a right full back, will then drop into a back three sometimes, if anyone else goes forward. It's very complicated. We'll come back to that. Here's a nice pass from Cucaré down the left-hand side to the bleach, Garnaccio, the former Manchester United man who does well against Bradley, and then Chelsea enjoying a bit of possession inside the Liverpool half after Liverpool's strong start to this match. Nilnil, if you've just joined us, if you've been out of the match this afternoon and just got back into the car, here is the hairy Cucaréa, who plays it in field, bounces back to Garnaccio, Garnaccio then, Enzo Fernandez is behind him, his ball into the box, Mamadash, filly with a stretch, but a very secure catch, actually. Just threw his arms up. I thought for a moment it was going to be over him, but no danger, caught it really confidently and well. Can I ask some goalkeepers, John-Anne, or you think, will this punch at those situations, because they're uncertain, Mamadash, really, he's never looked like that type of goalkeeper to me. If he can catch it, he will. Yes, Mamadash, filly, who has played a couple of times for Liverpool, but this is his Premier League debut, came on as a substitute. Obviously, when you were in Istanbul with them this week on Tuesday night, Pat, when Alisson picked up that injury, long one forward for Chelsea, but it will bounce through to Mamadash, filly, all in green, Alisson green, but orange gloves. The Georgian footballer of the year, last year, for 2024, and if you are tipping Kavic'a, Kavarad Scalia to that award, you must be decent. Extra special. I think Kavarad Scalia has won a few things before that. There's a good goalkeeper in Liverpool fans who haven't seen a great deal of them. I don't think you need to worry. You'll do OK. You were saying about Gusto and James. My daps at the moment, most of the time when they're in normal possession, I think Gusto will move into a slightly forward midfield draw, and James will go back and start it right back. But sometimes James will just port in as a back three and then walk forward from that, and that pushes Gusto even further forward. It's a version of what Peckbertole used to do with him and the third fullback going into midfield, but it's one step further developed from that. Let's see if it works. So it is 0-0 Chelsea, who, as I said, have lost their last two Premier League matches. Liverpool lost twice in the last eight days, as Salah is able to play one forward into the penalty area, but Isaac is outmuscled by Badi Ashild, who got himself in the right place in between Isaac and the ball, and it ran through for a goal kick. So 0-0 it is. Florian Vertz is on the bench for Liverpool again today. Still finding his way, feeling his way. Are you sure you were talking about that on Tuesday night with Ian in Istanbul? Yeah, definitely. I had some stats, I was... That's my surprise, I was on Liverpool TV yesterday morning, and I was talking to them, and their stats were saying that he has made more chances than anyone else in the Premier League this season. Canate dives in on the halfway line, Joe Pedro just got a touch to that. Chelsea continue attack, Garnaccio, then back to Enzo Fernandez 25 yards out. Still with it on the left-hand side, Liverpool fans booing and wishling Garnaccio, as a former Manchester United man, and then Qasado plays it over there to reach James in the centre-circle, so still 0-0. Interesting, Salah giving it another toe. At least in my talk, Chelsea look as if they're going to do something special. Here we go. Yeah, ball played for Enzo Fernandez, hit it square to Pedro, Malogusto tries to put in the cross, that's blocked by McAllister, it finds its way out to Netto on the right-hand side, thought he was going to cross with his left foot, then does bring it back onto his left foot, curls one in, but that's all about everyone, and all the way across the six-yard box and beyond the far post, and it is a goal kick pattern. Really good play by Netto, a very dangerous ball, and just tiny little bit too high, but I mean, that confused the centre-backs. It's interesting to see Netto, all he wants is a one-on-one versus Kierkees. The problem he's got is he's got two full-backs, Gusto and James, who both want to run by him, he can't kill all this piece he wants to run into. So they should decide when to and when not to run into that area. As the ball bounces back towards the edge of the Chelsea penalty area, but Badi Ashil is able to lift the volley out to the right-hand side and Rhys James pumps it forward, so Liverpool have got that at the back. So Chelsea, Liverpool nail this, five-live on a Saturday evening, the 5'30 kick-off as Mamadash Billy passes that and gives Virgil van Dijk no chance. That was at Nick height, Adam's apple height, and even though he let Ty got a touch on it, couldn't prevent it from going out for a throw-in to Chelsea, and the home sections very much enjoyed that van Dijk uncomfortable. You know, he can make great keepers these days, but they do the good footballers too. Excellent play, Kaisedo away from McAllister and shoots, and scores! That is a brilliant finish from Voices Kaisedo. It arrowed into the top corner. Nothing Mamadash Billy could do about that on his Premier League debut. Cracking start, cracking goal for Chelsea, one there against Liverpool. Well, he doesn't score that many, but he has last that. Absolutely into the top corner there. He's got it so clean, but he had so much space. Very noticeable, Liverpool have been giving a lot of space away in that sort of area, with the opposition 10s with play. Once again, it's Mamadash really tries, just plays the ball long this time. Very simple ball, he's given it away just before then, and the real problem you've got is if you lose it in that wrong area, too high up the park, there's no cover. This occasion, once again, for Liverpool, no cover, top corner for Kaisedo. Great goal, great hat. Giver made a good dive, made it look a better goal than it was. His star-cracker. Actually, he did get his fingertips to it, Mamadash Billy, as he dived to his right with his wrong hand, as it were. But there was a lovely little piece of footwork from Kaisedo that took him away from McAllister, just when he received the ball. He's the perfect touch, and he's made an excellent start to the game, Kaisedo. He's actually his third goal of the season already. He scored in the 5-1 at West Ham, scored as well in the 2-2 with Brentford. That's the pick of the bunch. Do you know what one thing I would say? Most Chelsea fans that I've talked to over the last few weeks, the complaint has been negativity. Just in Chelsea, Ben, I leave it to a negative for the players of God. Now, right from the start of this game, I've explained, it's been a 4-1, 4-1, not a 4-2, 3-1. So that's a way, leave it more positive, and think about who scored the goal. It's a mad builder who would have been one of the deeper-lying ones who's actually pushed up a lot of the cover. Now here's Jorah Pedro, receives it, left side of the penalty area. Suddenly, Chelsea are in full flow after Liverpool's very good start to the match, and Jorah Pedro's left foot across is over everyone, and will just bounce away out of play for a throw-in. But that was the very definition, wasn't it, of a rifling shot from... What was he, 22, 23 yards out, something like that? Got it so clean though. Back against Underland, and they've got three midfielders, but instead of two back, one up, it's actually one back, two up. And that's where they got the overload against McAllister. Here is Garnaccio now against Bradley, his ball into the area is cleared away by Canate. Do you remember when Chelsea signed him from Brighton? Do you remember Liverpool agreeing a fee with... Yeah, so close. What was that round about, £100 million, wasn't it? That was £110 million, that's right, it was £110 million, which forced Chelsea just to go a little higher, and he ended up here instead. Incredible, and he would do it, Jorah, for anything whatsoever. Mindtrack, Frank, third of equalised against Bayern Munich, it's 1-1. Garnaccio catches up with this ball down the left-hand side. Suddenly, Chelsea are transformed. Garnaccio back to Cucarrea, then infield, here is the goal scorer, they want him to shoot again, he's 35 yards away from goal this time, and he goes out, Garnaccio wisely, just plays it over the top, and it's headed out of play by Kirkes, for a throw-in under pressure from Neto, Neto takes the throw. Great response to this from Chelsea, who were really pinned back in by Liverpool in the early stages, but the champions, the Premier League champions, that is, find themselves 1-0 down again, Cucarrea with the ball into the box, but he's got too much on that, and it swirls away through the 6-yard box and behind for a goal kick. Chelsea leading Liverpool by 1-0 to Niel Kajseido's early goal. There is a choice of listening right now, Hulkeas St-Hallens is on Sports Extra, and the Saracens Bristol match is on Sports Extra 2, which you can hear only on the BBC Sounds app, Sports Extra 2. So that's your choice of listening, but also we'll be keeping you right across the fascinating Edinburgh Derby Gavin Wallace. It's 0-0 at the moment, and it is fascinating, both teams on beating so far this season, John. Hearts top of the league, if they win, they'll go 5 ahead of Celtic. A hip's win would see them go 3rd. That's how big it is already. 0-0, 3-played. Excellent play, Gagpole, then so much like with a chance, but it's blocked inside the 6-yard box, where both Cucarrea and Barri Ashile were there, one of them was able to make contact, and the offside flag then goes up. The ball comes back to him, it's bouncing just before him, but what he needs to make sure is he gets it low, gets it on target, with a lot of bit of a power. Now, he managed to do all that in the breakthrough, I thought there might have been an offside, but there wasn't. We've got a replay here. Sovislay does all the right things, but it's not the goalkeeper. I think it's Barri Ashile who gets his body in front of it. That really good break there for Liverpool, and a decent chance. Yeah, and I think Salah was deemed to be offside and interfering with play. I think it might have been Sovislay ran beyond and when he came back, he was then offside because he ran beyond the play. That Frankfurt goal's been disallowed, so Bayern Munich still winning 1-0. Chelsea won, Liverpool 0, and here is Sobos line-out, just outside the penalty area, trying to play it forward, but Chelsea defend a scurry and back in numbers. One of them was able to get a touch on that, and Chelsea have got it back. I mentioned the Hulkear St Helens playoff semi-final. That was a 5-30 kickoff, just like this Premier League match. What is the news with you, Chris Cooper? 15 minutes gone, John Hulkingston rovers 2, St Helens 0. The points from the boot of Arthur Moore, penalty wide out on the left-hand side after Jack Welzby was sin-bent. Their down to 12, they're up against it, 2-0 Rovers. 1-0 Chelsea here with almost 20 minutes played, and it's been a very watchable match so far, with it being such a windy day in London. I did wonder whether that might have had an effect, but not at all, Pat. One of the good things about Stamford Bridge is, it's very, very enclosed here. Not much of the wind going down there. Look at the flags in the corner flags. Absolutely motionless. I don't think it's having a great effect, but it's been a good game. It's gone on at a decent clip. A lot of players seem to be really sharp just now. Just watch them jump head-off the ball. Heat, he fancies himself against Canati. Put himself up against him all the time, twisting and turning and moving constantly, even when he's not got a ball. Yes, he already lured Canati in. Didn't be to put in a challenge. Actually, in the opposition half, very nearly got away from him in there. 1-0 Chelsea. I think they were a little nervous, the Chelsea supporters in the early stages, but the mood inside the ground has been transformed in the home sections. As you said, Pat, there's such a rich history, isn't there, between these clubs? Over the course of, probably the last quarter of a century now, over the course of the Abramovich years, and probably a little bit before that as well, as Caesero plays it for it. It is the 199th meeting in all competitions. Long ball for it by James. This is for Pedro Neto to race away down the right, but even he can't reach that in its outer play for throwing to Liverpool in their own left-back position. So Liverpool, after this testing week, having been in London last weekend and beaten by the currently very, very good Crystal Palace team, then having to go to Istanbul, now back to London, are already up against it. They certainly are. I mean, they look good. You do look good in the left hand side. Gakpo, who was quite quiet in the Istanbul, he's a very good start to this game. He's got the on-reach James quite a few times, and it is interesting. Almost all of the attacking play by Liverpool is on the left-hand side. It's just quite surprising when you've got a guy called Mosa on the right. It's barely been involved, Salah. 1-0 to Chelsea. Kaysedo, excellent goal. Look out for that match of the day tonight. Because new this season, all of the Premier League highlights available Saturday night, 8 o'clock. So you'll find then BBC Sport website, an app, and on the iPlayer as well. But Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney on match of the day tonight with Gabby Logan. Paul Bancers out of play on the halfway line, and it is a throw-in to Liverpool. I do get it. You were saying to me before the game, Pat, this Liverpool side looks to have a better balance, doesn't it? It does. The problem is, you need to be well-pressed by Canate. Try to give it to Van Dijk, but over-hitting ahead of him straight out of play for a throw. Not the first time over the last week or two. And certainly the game in Istanbul was very noticeable. Many times Liverpool gave it away in centre-back position, full-back position, deep-line midfield possession, and found themselves in very, very dangerous areas. You also have done that a few times this season as well, but they haven't done it much in this game so far. That might have been a foul-thrill by Pedro Neto, as he was looking to hurl it back into his own half, but as so often is the case, a blind eye has turned to that. Very noticeable game, top of Neto, up against Kirkess. I mean, Kirkess is the baton we saw just now. I'll tell you what, Neto fancies it. He's had one absolute clean foot race with him, and a show on the McLean pair of heels. He wants to get the ball all the time in that right-hand side, Neto. And Kirkess, who was brilliant going forward left-back area for Bournemouth, has he been over the half-wheeling yet? Not that I've seen. No, we've not really seen that Kirkess yet, have we, in the Liverpool shirt? He's got a challenge on his hands here against Neto. Another one of your former clubs, Pat Chelsea, that you must absolutely love coming here with so many wingers to watch. A surfeit of wingers. It's not just Chelsea. It's everywhere. Have a look at Arsenal. They're not bad for wingers. The current era has a very special time for wingers. Yes, and one of your new favourites, Estabal, is on the substitutes bench. Today, we'll probably see him later. Pat Eashill, nice play from him. Gives it to Gustav, who actually passed it slightly behind Neto. But, unless he's able to turn and set off towards Kirkess. Did you see Gustav ran right in his space again? Time and again, Neto's going, where can it go? He just ran into where I wanted to chase the pullback. Well, you know, Gustav's not playing in his natural position. As Garnaccio wins a free kick, half-way inside the Liverpool half, while they get themselves organised. Let's get another update from Chris Cooper at the Rubele. The whole Kingston Robes, 8th St Helen's Nill, making advantage of taking advantage of the numerical advantage. And Mikey Lewis has gone over in the corner, set up by Joe Burgess, great left-winger. He is for the whole Kingston Robes. The extra is added on from Morgay, from exactly the same spot, more or less, as the penalty a moment ago. Robes, 8th St Helen's Nill. Commentary continues on that, on Sport Extra, on your digital radio, BBC Sounds app, free kick, then 4th Chelsea, Neto, Chelsea leading by one goal to Nill. Spored in the 15th minute. And we are now in the 25th minute, and this free kick, Neto gesticulating. Rhys James actually runs over it and then runs away. This is out on the left-hand side, half-way inside the Liverpool half, and it's clipped forward by Neto into the Liverpool penalty area, headed out. Then the shot by Gustav, but not convincing, blocked in the area. They want him to shoot again, but he gives it to Neto, who runs onto it, and then curls it in right foot, that's a teaser. But Mamadashvili's able to come, leap high, catch it, then falls over as he over-arms it out. For Salah, here he is, finally into the action again. The former Chelsea player, Mo Salah, briefly, before things really took off for him. But all he can do there, Pat, is actually play the ball back into his own half, and it ends up with Mamadashvili again. They're going to defend it down the right back here, from Rhys James. He had a lot in his hands there, and he's got more Salah. He won him one, he's not got any cover, but he didn't dive in, didn't do anything silly, held him up. Well, as Salah is hauled over by Badi Ashil on the half-way line, then it's played forward for the run of Bradley, and referee Anthony Taylor, I thought he could have brought that play back. He's saying there was no foul there. Really? So he must have seen Salah doing the same to Badi Ashil. OK, here is Salah running at Badi Ashil into the penalty area from the right-hand side. But Badi Ashil did well enough, actually, stood up against him, and ends up Fernandez, the Chelsea number eight, was able to come back into his own half, and then played forward for Joao Pedro, who had to be offside, and indeed he was flagged. The rare sight of a flag actually going up, which gives you an idea how far offside he must have been. Well, I didn't think he was that far offside. That's a wee bit tighter than that. Mind you, Pat, this is the top team. Look how tight he was. However he was off. I agree with that, but there was definitely no daylight, and you're supposed to give it... You've got fear for a reason. For a reason, yeah. However, this is the top team, Anthony Taylor, Gary Bezic, Adam Nunn, the assistant. That is the World Cup team that'll work together. Has that both played forward for Kirkes, and he is bursting forward now. Pedro Neto has gone back with him, the two of them, on the opposite end of the pitch together, and Neto did his job on it, bounced off Kirkes and threw for Goldkirk. Do you know how you're talking earlier on about individual battles here, and the one between Kukerell and Sal? That is very interesting in itself, and it hasn't really exploded yet. The one between Kirkes and Neto has been really special so far, but that's the first time you're writing off that Kirkes has got to the violin. What arms has got that red net all right, Mercedes? The Goldkirk is taken by Robert Sanchez for Chelsea, and it's deflected out of play off Kirkes. Chelsea won, Liverpool nil, is the score, almost half an hour played. Television cameras just now focused in on some of the Chelsea players not involved in this match, most notably Col Parma, with the groin injury that's keeping him out for Chelsea, and for England as well. And Chalabas suspended for this match, because De Lape is out for a period of time, for Fana, Santos, the young midfielder as well, and you mentioned Tosan Adorabiojo as well. Here's Liverpool with Gravenberg, Saracen's winning 17-0 in that 5-25 kickoff in the prem. And speaking of England, the captain Harry Kane has scored again for Bayern Munich, Frankfurt nil, Bayern Munich 2 in that Bundesliga match. Kane who's almost unstoppable at the moment, as Thomas Tuchel was saying to me yesterday, he doesn't just score in every game, he seems to score two in every game. Yeah, but I was talking to a film note of a BBC's reporter, and it was quite surprising when I said I really rate Kane right alongside Harlan, absolutely alongside Harlan. Now you might have less goals in a certain amount of games, but look at the teams that Harry's played for before, you know, Clifford Spursford all that time, where as Harlan's always playing for the likes of Manchester City, etc. I know England fans love Harry, still think he's the best in the world, isn't he? Brilliant. Chelsea winning the ball back in the centre of third, in fact, Söder's lie was just caught there by Kaiseido, and that is giving us a free kick, and Söder's lie has stayed down, holding his left leg just above the knee, which he has stretched straight out. Anthony Taylor did bring it back for that one. Well, he's not moved that knee. The giveaways, very, very different giveaways you see with players, and I'm hoping it's not his left. I think, yeah. He got a roof right there. Sometimes with the harps, you feel a jar, and he's felt a jar at the top of his knee. That is the real fear always for footballers, you know, ACLs and things like that, but he's up, he's moving. His foot wasn't planted, so it's probably just a knock. Yeah, Söder's lie, who has been, you know, quite possibly Liverpool's best player this season. So why play him at the right back, when he's unsuited to? Well, he's in the midfield role here today, and Liverpool have got to come from behind. Kirk has played it all the way through, couldn't find the pass back to Gackpohl, Chelsea cheers for that, and it is through for a goal kick. So 1-0 Chelsea lead after earlier Arsenal won. So they are currently, if you look at the Premier League table now, top by one point after their 2-0 win against West Ham in our earlier five-live commentary match. Sports Extra, Manchester United were winning 2-0 against Sunderland. They're eighth in the table now, Manchester United. And here's Gackpohl, earlier Tottenham winning 2-1 at Leeds in the lunchtime kickoff, and Tottenham are in third. Frank Lampard's Coventry, top of the championship now, and doing very, very nicely. And scoring for fun. Just to very much in the Frank Lampard stale as a player. Lots of goals. Yeah, just looking for his banner, there it is. Halfway up the Matthew Harding stand. Super Frankie Lampard, number eight. White letters on the blue background. So 1-0 Chelsea lead. The former leaders, Middlesbrough, were beaten 1-0 at Portsmouth in the championship. All the news on the football pages of the BBC Sport website, as Chelsea thought they were away there, but the referee brought it back for a foul by Fernandez, so a free kick to Liverpool, ten yards inside their own half. As Pat suggested, Phil McNulty and Nizar Cancelo will be writing on this match on the website. They'll be able to read their words later. Here is Canate, passing it forward to Psalah. Psalah with the three goals that he scored so far in all competitions. He's challenged. Well, that was uncompromising from Fernandez. He went down. Liverpool still in possession. Anthony Taylor says play on, which they do with the long-haired Sobozlai, who goes back to halfway to Canate. Van Dijk now with Zwaopedro hering around, putting him under pressure. And then there's a misplace pass by Graven Burke, ahead of Perkis, out of play, throwing to Chelsea. And this hasling and harrying is working for Chelsea. Yeah, but it's just not as smooth with Liverpool at the moment. There hasn't been all season. We know that. It just isn't quite clicking. And we have hardly mentioned his ex-name, Old David. We know how brilliant a player he is. He's not linking up much. Certainly, most of us never get away from Coeuréa at any point in time. Chelsea fans feeling that Garnaccio was sandwiched there. No free kick, but then Gusto, poor pass from him, wasn't able to pass it forward for Netto. You could hear somebody smashing their fist against the table, top in frustration. Then it's played through, Coeuréa's with a touch, he squares it, could have gone for goal, but was unselfish, tried to square it for Zwaopedro. And Chelsea intercepted it, and were able to clear away and already attacking away downfield now on the left wing with Garnaccio. Garnaccio up against Bradley, moves infield, Coeuréa on the overlap, arrives now, the Spanish international. Fernandez then back to Coeuréa, who goes down, rather theatrically, as is often the case, but Anthony Taylor says it was a foul, and it's a yellow card for Bradley. So the Liverpool right back is booked for that, more on that from Pat Neven in a moment after you hear from Chris Cooper again. Hulkingston Rovers, 12, St. Hallens, 0, totally dominant so far. Second try of the night, this time it's come from Joe Burgess. The video ref had a look, but he said yes. Arte more couldn't add the extras, St. Hallens not had a sniff so far. 12-0 Hulke, AR. Coming through on Sports Extra, and also the Grand Final, you'll be able to hear that here on Five Live, this time next week, 6 o'clock kickoff, still hearts 0, pips 0. Pat? With that yellow card down, it has to give him a yellow card. But I'll tell you what, Coeuréa was very clever, because he was dragging Bradley back first, and both of them were dragging. Coeuréa knows when to leave goal, when the referee turns round. Since the referee turns round, all he sees is Bradley pulling him back, yellow card. He is very adept, isn't he, at that. Played square, Gusto then, lift 1 over top, a stretch from Pedro Netto, who is sliding, looking to pull it across, but wasn't able to make any contact. And it's a goal kick. Well-worked free kick there. Almost got him on in the byline, right when the six yards out to the goal line, which would have been a very dangerous place. When you looked at me for a comment there, I thought you were going to ask for a comment, the Hibbs-Harts game. Two unbeaten teams, that's a very positive way of putting it in the Hibbs of 1-1 in the hearts of 1-5. Yeah, it's obviously playing it to Salah. Salah has attempted threat of the ball. Pass Badia Shield doesn't work, because the Chelsea number five went to ground and was able to clear it away. No call will either, I don't think I mentioned his name, but when I was talking about the players who are unavailable, Big Miss with that knee injury, he may very well have been in the England setup as well under Thomas Tuchel. It's interesting yesterday, wasn't that the news on Jude Dyingham being left out? You know I'm not even mildly surprised at that. Well, the coach, the head coach, said that it was all in the interests of continuity. Here is Chelsea breaking forward now to the edge of the penalty area, where the excellent run from the teenager, the central defender, Atchamp-Pom to the edge, the Liverpool box eventually in came the challenge, put it out for a throw on the right-hand side. It's a little bit shaky a few times when he's come in to the Chelsea, atchamp-Pom, he's not moved that way today. I mean, getting the ball running forward, that's not the first time he's done it, and going into almost 18, posing 18 yard line, so real buster confidence from Atchamp-Pom. He may well get a run of a couple of games now. Yep, he may well do as Sanchez clears the way downfield, but splits Kukerea and Gonacho, and actually hit it straight on a slot, he tops the field, who killed it dead. Yeah, I was very impressed by that, one of the best touches of the game so far. You look at Liverpool, you just wonder, you know, lots of new players, we know that, you know, Vitz is not playing, but he's a new player, you're looking at, he's trying to fit in with the team and understand how to play. But there's not as many in today, I thought it would have been a lot more smooth than it has been so far. So it's 1-0 to Chelsea, BBC Radio 5 live, and Chelsea, Nettle comes out with the ball as Kirk has challenged him, so now, Nettle, away down the right wing, Van Dijk has cruised across, but Nettle takes him on and beats him, and then the low ball into the six yard box, is turned behind by the falling Canate, and it's a corner to Chelsea. First of all, Kirk is bad mistake, but Nettle took a good advantage of it. When he's got to run from that halfway line, Virgil van Dijk's thinking, OK, I'll get you in a position where I won't chase you, I won't have to get in a foot race with you. And I can see past your nettle, mech pedaling and thinking, I don't care, I'm going to run straight at you, because I can do you for pace. And he does, he gets to the byline there, gets the ball beyond him, and eventually the ball is kicked away in the six yard line, but nettle's really caught the eye at the start. That's good, that's really good. We have to say, Pat, he's a player I do love to watch when he's in full flow. Corner is taken short, Liverpool have conceded four of the now eight goals they've let in in the Premier League this season from set pieces, but Chelsea played short, Cucarrea now back, Garnaccio right foot, but curling it. There were a whole crowd of players in front of him, tried to whip it, bend it round them from just outside the D, not enough whip on it, it didn't come back in, it flashed past the post. I'll make a guess you tonight, you will see that analysed in match of day tonight, because that's one of the best set piece corners I've actually seen this season. Now he has gone, Garnaccio down the left hand side into the penalty area, sub-boss line with a challenge, Anthony Taylor was less than ten yards away, he was not interested, not in the slightest. And Van Dijkers walked over to Anthony Taylor, making the diving motion, suggesting that Garnaccio has thrown himself down. We'll find out, because the VAR will look at it, they have thrown himself down, but it's likely thrown himself down after some touch. And there's a little shove in the back by Schoab Osly, just a little shove with the left hand in his back. Now it's not a lot, but it might be enough, they might think from that angle. I think that would be tough, the VAR are having a look. It's up on all of the screens here, all around the ground. So Anthony Taylor, has he been called a cr- No, I think he's coming across with his yellow card. So someone who said Enzo Moresca, I think, has said something to the fourth official, Farai Halan, and it's a yellow card for Enzo Moresca, who sarcastically claps as Anthony Taylor runs back onto the pitch, so that is behind his back. And there's lots of pinting going on down there. A member of the Liverpool coaching staff has also got involved. The fourth official is just trying to step in between them. And they've looked at it and they've said, no, it's not a penalty, they've backed up Anthony Taylor's decision on the field. From the distance, like yourself, I didn't think that, and look at him, we have closed our penalty kick. You throw yourself to the ground. When you see it again, slow motion, every single angle, surprise, surprise, there's a little nudge. A little hand in the small of Canacho's back, and he's made the most of it, right, but there is a hand in his back. So, had he given it first time, he wouldn't have changed it. Definitely wouldn't have changed it. Yes, one of those, but I don't think Anthony Taylor would have been inclined to give that. I don't know what to say. You've made a look at the different levels and that you could give a penalty kick at. That's the level that seems to be harsh to give a penalty kick for me. Anthony Taylor famously, not Chelsea's favourite referee, corner taken short by Liverpool. It swirled away across the penalty area, and I say Chelsea, I mean Chelsea's supporters. He has Gakpo, Gakpo still going left-footed cross, but it's caught by Sanchez at the near post, and he's going to deliver it for Canacho to chase. Liverpool defenders back with him, Sobo's lie. Canacho trying to beat the two of them, the ball bounces up, and Sobo's lie is able to head it away, still probably seven or eight yards outside of the penalty area. And then Sobo's lie stands up to Fernandez's challenge, and it's played back to the edge of the box. I have to say, Pat, I'm quite enjoying this. Well, it was out in my mouth. I just looked up the clock there and it says 41 minutes. Thank you, where did that go? I mean, it has been a good game. It has been generally fought in a good way, you know, attacking not many players throwing themselves to the ground too easily. It's been quite an open game as well. There have been chances both sides, a lot of the people. I've had two very, very good chances. But at the moment, I have to say, one now. It's probably just about the right score in the fact that Chelsea have just... After the first ten minutes, I think they've been slightly better side. And after all of the money that Liverpool have spent, remember, more than any other club in the recent transfer window. In fact, these two were the top two, the biggest spenders in the world in the last transfer window. Liverpool spending, well, upwards of £400 million in Chelsea. Not that far behind them, £300 million, although they did make the Boog's balance, as Gusto plays it across field, Garnaccio inside the penalty area, but wasn't able to trap that. Like on a slot a few moments ago, it bounced away from him, Garnaccio. And with Enzo Fernandez, Enzo Fernandez looking to see if the opportunity is there to curl it into the box, but gives it back to Garnaccio, then further back and all the way back to the halfway line now. But the point I was going to make, Pat, is that this Liverpool team that's out there has really got a last-season feel to it, apart from Isaac through the middle, Kierkez at left back, and obviously Mamadrasz-Villi in goal, but Isaac has not been in the match. No, he hasn't been in the match yet. It's just not shuttered him yet. There's no link-up play. Right at the start, he tried to link up twice with Moshala, but neither of them really can get into the match now. A space opens up, they mate. Gives it to Salah. Left for the point, Isaac with a head-out, it's over the top. What a pass from Salah that outside of the boot pass from Salah on the right wing. That was almost perfection. Do you know how quickly I was trying to get that line, and they might get an understanding yet by the time of the end of the sentence? Salah's got the ball, and you're right. Left boot on Isaac's head. Now he was stretching for it a little bit, but I think he'll be a bit disappointed in himself that he doesn't get that on target. Not many opportunities over between the two of them, but they don't really need that many opportunities because of such quality players. I've said it before, I think Ekitiki, the way he plays, and maybe almost are better suited through the middle, and there's no doubt in my mind that eventually, during some games, and maybe even this one, you see Ekitiki and Isaac on the same bench at the same time. If you weren't listening earlier, Ekitiki is on the bench for Liverpool today. That was their best chance, Liverpool, Isaac with a header. Should he have done better there, Pat Richardson? Yeah, he'll know that he should get that on target. There was a little bit behind him, and he was stretching a wee bit, but that's the deal, you get them on target and ask the goalkeeper a question, and he didn't manage to do that, but at least he's got himself in the right position. Chelsea won, Liverpool 0-5 live. Listen as well by the BBC Sounds app. You can pause, rewind the live action. Garnaccio gets his ankle tapped by Bradley, who is on a yellow card, and it's a free kick. And he knows he's done it, and I don't think he's deliberately kicked him, but the feet were too quick to him, getting actually there. He's absolutely on his last warning now, isn't he, Bradley? With the shout for the penalty, by the way, it's just up on the screen now, and the explanation is that the contact on Saba's lie, from Saba's lie, on Garnaccio was deemed to be minimal. Well, I think that's almost exactly the worst time he's there. There's not enough in that to make you go down, certainly not on the stale, that he did go down, but that would be a very, very soft penalty. I think Chris Sutton might have his eyes on that for the simulation game tomorrow night on 6-0-6. Free kick then, two minutes of added time at the end of this entertaining first half, which has contained so far one goal, but a very good goal from Moises Caicedo, the Ecuadorian international. Here's the free kick from James. It's attempted, Neopo's glance just heads it up in the air, and then it's cleared away by McAllister, Salah, and Neto, a wrestling, and then the ball is pumped forward straight out of play goal. Here's a question that Liverpool fans will be asking just now. Remember the recent game, I think it was against Burnley, where Kirk has got booked for diving, and the manager took him off after 38 minutes, allegedly because he feared he would be sent off, right? Well, Bradley's been booked. He's just had another fill there that he knew could have been read. What does Anastasia do at half-time now? Does he keep him on? Does he take a chance? Because you're going to have to put somebody in there who's not an absolute out and out right back. You're going to have to do a front-ball, but you're going to have to ask Schoblezlai to go back into that area again, which hasn't looked brilliant, hasn't it? I suppose Joe Gomez is also an option. Must be a temptation. That's a shame for Bradley, because when he would love to get up front, you know, do some overlapping, work really well with Salah, there has been no opportunity to do that so far. Still Hart's nil, Hibbs nil, and we'll have more reaction to the afternoon three-o-clock kick-offs at half-time in this match on five-lie. All out of play for throwing two Liverpool. I think this will be the last action of the first half as Bradley takes the throw back to Canate, and there is the half-time whistle. So Liverpool after their two defeats in the last eight days, they've never lost three in a row under Anna Slott so far, but at half-time it's Chelsea who have beaten them one nil. They are, and again, Liverpool fans know they've not been firing in all cylinders this season. And once again, there's been moments where it looked okay, but the real stars you expect to shine Salah incredibly quiet. Isaac as well, but getting very, very little service, and it just has looked quite disjointed out there. When Chelsea without being absolutely brown have created a few chances themselves. There is not much in it, but I think Chelsea are edging it just now. One bit they did stand out. The ball was played to the right-hand side, it didn't even attempt the header alongside Cucarilla. And just a few moments before that, Cucarilla got the ball run away from, Salah stood still, didn't chase back. I suspect Anna Slott might have noticed that. But the goal, a really good one, a lovely shuffle from Caiseado past McAllister. Excellent finish, may well be a contender for goal of the month. Half-time, Chelsea won, Liverpool nil. But Liverpool right side is taking a little while to adjust, isn't it, to new players, Pat? How delicately put, Mark! But Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving was always going to be more than just a right-back going, wasn't it? Yes, I get your point, but I have to say I think Bradley's fabulous. I think Bradley, when he plays it, he's very, very best. When Liverpool on form, where they earn the front foot, he flies forward and looks almost as good, or maybe as good sometimes as Trent. However, he's not got forward at all at any point in this game. Salah's done very little, I mean he's not even chasing back. And anyway, that's the way he plays, and maybe he has to play that way because when he needs to expose the power, he might score two goals and he's done the right thing. But there's nothing coming from there. I think a little bit, a lot more dangerous left-hand side. Gack post down really, really well. Shubham's fine when he breaks through that kind of left-hand side from the midfield. He looks strong as well, but in the Premier League, you do need everybody working hard. And with the best will in the world, that's not most Salah these days. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant way as underlined three times in Red Pen. He's not famously the most hard-working player off the ball either. He just wonders sometimes, and he gets something there, he's going to really put himself about so that those two players can get the space. And when they get space, then they can be their brilliant selves. But what rate? And that right-hand side, it's not looked like. Chelsea lead by Golden Hill at the break-back with John and Pat for the second half. And then it's Natalie Pike and Christensen with 6-0-6, 0-8, 0-8-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. About ten minutes to go to halftime in the Edinburgh Derby, Gavin Wallace. That mark, it's 0-0 at the moment. Just as Hartzler in a dangerous area, but it comes to nothing. The best for Hartzler came through the Greek midfielder, Alexandros Kerasidis. He's had two good chances, one whistled over the bar and a free kick at the far side, just by the post. This is meaty, and it's a real derby, but it's still 0-0. The first half of the home side in Super League, Chris. Totally dominant, Hulkear 12, St. Helens 0, we're 10 seconds away from the interval. St. Helens haven't had a sniff, early points from a morgue penalty, and then tries from Lewis and Burgess. Could have been another one just a moment ago, but Pidermickel was held up by Jack Weltsby, who'd been sin-bin. There goes the halftime hooter. Rovers 12, Sts with an awful lot to do, 0. In the other sport that's going on at the moment, Carlisle, lead at Scunthorpe by a goal to 0 in the National League, and Scunthorpe are down to 10 in that game as well. Glynarvan won up on Porter down at halftime in the Northern Irish Premiership in the Scottish League 1, goalless between Queen of the South and Alloa. In the Welsh Premier League, Colwyn Bayer won up on Cynarvan, and in Rugby Union's Prem, Saracens have had a very good first half at home to Bristol. They lead by 24 points to 0 in the Rugby Championship at halftime. Benetton 3, Glasgow 14, Bulls lead Lensster by 22 points to 10.

And in the football today in the Premier League, Tottenham won 2-1 at Leeds in the lunchtime game. Arsenal have gone top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win at home to West Ham. Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0. Coventry put five past Sheffield Wednesday to go top of the Championship. Middlesbrough lost away at Portsmouth. The bottom two now in the Championship. Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday. Steven Nidger on top of League One and they have a game in hand on second place. Bradford after they beat Luton 2-0. Walsall are on top of League Two after coming from a goal down to beat Bristol Rovers 2-1. Newport have dropped to the bottom after they were beaten at home by Swindon. Steve Cotcroft and his first game back as Cheltenham manager saw them beat Fleetwood and they move out to the bottom two. And Manchester City have closed the gap at the top of the WSL to one point after a 3-2 win over Arsenal. 23 minutes past six will bring you some reaction to the day's football after Round On Me and the News.

This is Five Lives Sports with Mark Chapman. Listen on BBC Sounds. Chelsea Agola, Pawn, Liverpool at the break, second half on the way here on Five Lives. They're still goalless in the Edinburgh Derby between hearts and hips. Arsenal went top of the table earlier as they beat West Ham 2-0 in Mikhail Arteza's 300th game in charge of the club. He's been talking to John Sathl. And Mikhail, that rounded off a pretty good week, didn't it? A massive week, I would say. Two very tough matches against Newcastle Olympiacos. That has taken a lot of energy out of us, but we discussed that after doing that, today was the day to capitalise on what we've done in the last two months because we had some very difficult fixtures, some big injuries on top of that, a lot of players that have managed because they were coming from long-term surgeries as well. Overall, I think with today's win, we are in a really good position. Your 300th appearance today, so a good way to mark that. But how do you reflect on that time here? Well, the first thing is gratitude. First of all, to ownership, then to... Especially to my coaching staff, they've been with me since day one through all the up and downs. And I know that I have the best people in the world next to me, and I really value them. And without them, it was impossible to do my job, and especially enjoy it. And after all the plays and stuff that they've been with us, inspiring me, helping me, making me a very coach, helping me to thrive in difficult moments as well. And then, obviously, to our supporters, they've been always incredibly supportive with me. And 300 is a lot. So I just wanted to celebrate with a win. I've done it. We had an international break, so it's a good window now to put the breaks down a little bit and then I start to prepare the next book. Mason Mann got the first goal for Manchester United as they beat Sunderland 2-0. Here he is. I thought we showed a lot of character today, obviously coming off a very tough result. Yeah, there was a lot of pressure on us. There's a lot of pressure on us every game, as you know. So, yeah, for us to get the win today was very important. I think we've been solid at home. So we're building that confidence, and the start of the game was so important to really come out sharp the first five minutes, and we did that. And we're very happy to get the three points and then, obviously, moving into a bit of a break now, but we'll be focused to really improve as a team going into the next one. When you say there's pressure on you every game, when there's noise around the football club, is it easy for you as players to blank that out? Yeah, just don't look at it. Just don't look. It's as simple as that. We have to stay focused on what we do, what the manager wants us to do. The responsibilities that we have and what he wants, that's the most important thing for us. We know as players how much it hurts when we lose games and when we don't perform to what we know we can. So we know exactly how it feels when we're there. So it hurts us when we come off a defeat and we've got a week before the next game. We're sitting on it and we really have to look deep to really pull the character out of every single one of our players and the staff. But we've got it there. We showed today we can obviously come off a difficult game and perform, but we just need to do this consistently now. And I think we've got the players, we've got the team, we've got the staff to do that. Mason Mount after Manchester United's 2-0 win over Sunderland. The gamer, Alan Road at lunchtime, finished Leeds 1, Tottenham 2, the first goal scored by Mattis Tell and he's with Gareth Mowbray. Mattis, the first goal in the Premier League this season, how does it feel to be on the winning side here? For sure, I'm very happy about my first goal. And I will say that with the team we worked a lot this week and I just say out there this goal and I'm very happy about it. Deflected in? Was it on target? Was it going in anyway? I tried to, I had the opportunity to shoot so I tried to shoot and I scored so I'm very happy. Any win away in the Premier League is a big win but you seem to really keenly celebrate this one. How much does it mean to the team? Because the opponent was very, very good today. It was a tough game for us because of the opponent and we fought until the end and we showed them big mentality so that's why I think we deserve to win this game. Thanks Mattis. Mattis Tell who got Tottenham's first win in their 2-1 victory at Leeds, just the four Premier League games today. There's plenty of stuff going on in the Championship and League 1 and League 2 though. Natalie and Chris here with 6-0-6 at the end of the game at Stanford Bridge. Yes and Chris Tottenham is actually going to be here in the studio with me as well. Where is he? I think he's getting a sandwich after his work this afternoon. He swears he is going to be in the studio with me. It's very exciting. Oh you! I hope you like to speak to myself and Chris Tottenham. It's 08085 909693. We want to hear from Liverpool fans.

Three home wins in a row now from Manchester United. It was Amarim's 50th game in charge. So Reds, are you seeing any progress? I want to speak to WSL fans today. I was at the Manchester City Arsenal game earlier. Manchester City were phenomenal. So city fans, can you do it? Can you finally break Chelsea's dominance of the WSL? And Arsenal fans, are you out of the title race after five games? 08085 909693. And also Coventry fans, unbelievable in the championship. 27 goals have scored this season. Nine in four days. Is Frank Lampard going to return you to the promised land? We want to hear from you. 08085 909693. Well, like I say, it's good luck. Let's go to Tyne Castle as we approach halftime there. Gavin? Yeah, we're about 45 seconds away. We're a minute and a bit into the two minutes added on. Still 0-0. The best chances, as we said earlier, came to the Greek midfield. This play is a winger. Alexandros Keresides to both whistle just by the woodwork on both occasions. But yeah, halftime, it's coming now. 0-0. Thank you Gavin. Second half, maybe a minute or so away at Stamford Bridge. It looks John Murray as though Liverpool are going to make a change. Yeah, as flagged up by Pat just before the break, it looks as though it is going to be... ...Thurts coming on to replace Conor Bradley. I don't see him out there, so that Pat obviously means a switch from Saba's lie back to right back. Yeah, it wasn't me particularly clothe up there. It did exactly the same thing we cared for last week. Oh, the other week there against Burnley, so yeah, no surprise that change. Chelsea, just waiting for them. The Liverpool players are out there. Thurts is about to come on as it's up to Hukes. For the second time as Liverpool player, he's just getting his final instructions on a slot with the light from the floodlights glinting off the top of his head. Arm around his shoulder, gives him a pass on the back. Here come Chelsea. They come up the steps from the tunnel and pass underneath a banner that says World Champions on the top of the dugout. And there we see the number going up of Conor Bradley's number 12, who was booked in the first half. Then put another challenge in on Garnaccio and therefore Arna Slot has made that decision. So Florian Wirtz, the number 7, is on. Chelsea's team as it started, Sanchez as the goalkeeper, then James, Atchampong, Padilla Sheel and Cucarrea. Reisado, the goal scorer, then Neto, Gusto, Fernandez and Garnaccio with João Pedro through the middle. And the Liverpool team now sobozlai in position. Yes, he is as the right back, Canate Van Dijk and Kierkes in front of Mamadash Vili. Then Gravenberg, Nicalista, Wirtz, Salag Acpo and Izak. Liverpool on the move. Wirtz with a flick across, Salaslan shoots wide. Arriving on the corner of the six yard box, slightly stretching for it. And as he shot goalwards and wide, I think he caught Cucarrea on his follow through. But Chance not taken by Salas first minute of the second half. Yes, Tony is right for it, but he can usually do that. However, the touch by Wirtz is absolutely fabulous. What unbelievably good pass. Again, you'll see it match the day of the game. Chance to see this pass. Look at it. I mean, just the imagination. You put your body in that position, you make that pass. We can see the volume floating, can't you? Well, that was a bit of vision and a bit of talent in that one. Wow, goodness me. That was a work of art. That could have been in the Met where I was earlier this week. Chelsea won, Liverpool, Nail. Yeah, that's exactly what you need when people are questioning how quickly you're settling, something like that. Particularly if it had set up the goal, which you could easily have done as Gapol shoves over Rhys James, and that's a great kick to Chelsea inside their own home. They found a few good clear cut chances in me. Kierke has got through in the goalkeeper. So obviously, I think he had one kicked off a line early in the first half, and now you're looking at Mo Salah getting a one-on-one with the goalkeeper, admittedly at a bit of an angle. But even so, if anybody you know who's better from that sort of angle than Mo Salah usually. So, for all Liverpool, having been at their very best, they still had some very good clear cut chances. Yes, when he's at his best, he's got an airing knack. Mo Salah have been able to find the eye of the needle, hasn't he, in those sort of positions, but it wasn't this time. Paul is back with Mamadash Veli, beaten only by that brilliant shot from Caesedo in the 15th minute of this match. A lovely goal that, so a time and again at half-time. Although my suggestion that it might be the goal of a month has already been poo-pooed by you, Pat. I think Bournemouth have got a player who would claim to play a two-or-three in last night. I mean, certainly the third goal, you know, the dribble along the byline and the second half just didn't join. It's absolutely an absolute draw. Well, they'll all be on match of the day tonight, as that's rather an awkward clearance from Atchapun, who's off-balance and just sliced it straight out of play. The Liverpool supporters there, they know their team need them here. Liverpool facing the possibility of three defeats in a row. After seven wins in a row, now possibly three defeats in a row, but there's a long way to go. And Liverpool with Sabauslai back to Canate, still ten yards inside the Chelsea half as Liverpool attack towards the shed end as the ball is passing field. By Salah, but that's easy for Chelsea to clear on the edge of the box, barrier shield passing it away. Now it's with Gusto in this midfield position for Chelsea today with James at right back. James coming up to join them groans because Gusto wasn't able to take it on, and this Chelsea attack has sort of ground to a halt from quite a promising position. Here is Caesero, the goal scorer. Then Rhys James. Gusto back all the way in Liverpool. Chelsea are actually going to go all the way back towards their goalkeeper Sanchez, just out of his penalty area at the shed end. Walked around the back of there on the way into the ground today. I have to say, I always think this, the way that they've kept the back of the old shed, the shed wall, and they've got all of the pictures of so many of the great Chelsea players up there. It's like a Chelsea museum. There is one round the other side of the ground, actually, a museum, but you're right, it does look good and it's been never quite a long time. I'm surprised that the new owners haven't adapted it. With Ivy creeping up the wall as well. Bull played forward by James and Kirk has been able to catch that well ahead of Pedro Neto. So Liverpool go back to Mamadash Vili. Arsenal now top of the table after their win in our three o'clock commentary this afternoon. We're bringing you commentary on eight of the Premier League matches this weekend. Really busy day tomorrow. Join us from that with Steve Crossman. Five lives Premier League Sunday from 12 o'clock tomorrow. The five live commentaries, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and then Brentford Manchester City. So that's for you tomorrow afternoon. The Singapore Grand Prix will be on Sport Extra. We'll have commentary on the arc as well as Liverpool have the ball with Canate, just in front of the penalty area. Ekotike is on the bench. Isaac has been quiet just that one chance from that brilliant cross from Salah late in the first half. As Liverpool, the Verzies appealing for a handball and referee Anthony Taylor agrees. So it's a great kick to Liverpool inside their own half. One nil Chelsea lead, five minutes played in the second half. Line's open for 606. Have you been at a match this afternoon? Give Natalie Pike and Chris Sutton a call. 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3. It's free from mobiles and landlines. Ball forward now for Isaac to chase up against Kukere. Just well actually to keep it in. Hooks it in field. He'd scored the last two times he's been here with Newcastle. Isaac, but in the end Chelsea win it back. But Isaac's challenge has gone natural. No free kick. Gravenberg, low shot from him but straight at Sanchez. He's able to drop forward under his knees and gather the ball securely up into his chest. Good work there by Isaac. He's having to get work and get in the ball himself. He's not getting played in often enough by his team mates. And that's why he probably looks at Verz coming on and thinking, can I build a relationship with you? And if he can do, that could be special. Chouel Pedro is having a break away from the half. Wailang's still going right for a shot. Actually hits Van Dijk on the edge of the penalty area. It did open up from there though the space and then net all come. Can't find the pass to James and Kirk has just steps forward. He cuts out the pass then with his left foot, the Hungarian international up towards Isaac, but it bounces off and bounces back to him. And all he can do is knock it out of play for a throw on the halfway line. Well, everybody's watching Neto and he tried to play the ball to Rhys James. He's overlapped. Had he got his head up and looked in the middle, he had two players unmarked. Winlam, Chouel Pedro and the other one was Gusto. And both of them were unmarked around about the 18-yard line. But he didn't get his head up and look, and that's why there were huge groans around the ground, because that was a chance. Here's Garnaccio on the left-hand side. He's up against Sobozlai now who's able to get a touch on that. He was very tight on him, Sobozlai, on Garnaccio. Centrefield, McAllister, just lifts a pass forward and it bounces into the space in front of Salah, who's under this, comes inside by Yashil. Left-foot shot flies away over the top left corner into the Liverpool fans, actually, in the lower tier of the shed stand. But there's warm applause there for Liverpool's intent, if not for the finish. Yeah, and when he's exposed up, he is exposed up, and he gets the ball there, he's around from the halfway line. And you know, actually, probably three, four, five seconds before he actually gets a shot away, what he's going to do, he comes across the 18-yard line, Chelsea know he's going to do that, so they're pushing further along, further along. All the time the angles disappear in, and he can't quite get up on target. And now Chelsea, now this should be a big concern for Chelsea. And the fact that they're sitting their backs are going down constantly, like flies, is that? Try to see if it's bad, there shows a whole group of players around them. You know, who's sat down inside the penalty area, and the Chelsea medical men are on, and they are communicating with the rest of the staff on the side of the pitch, and what is this season, the Chelsea coaching anorak, which are a very dirty grey, sort of faded grey, padded jackets, and there's lots of head scratching going on down there, which kind of suggests to me that they think Paddy Ashile is not going to be able to continue here. I mean, a real concern, as I say, longer term for Chelsea, going for centre-backs, you know, for Fana, Colville, Towson, as you mentioned before, and if you can't make it here and can't play on, there are lots of options. You ask him to play Caesero centre-back, he can play Rhys James in centre-back, right centre-back, no problem whatsoever, he can do that. Yeah, they're going to make a change, Paddy. Liverpool are going to make a double change as well. Robertson and Jones are coming on for Liverpool. Interesting time for Arna Slott to do that, ten minutes gone in the second half. Can I say, I mean, it sounds as if I'm being slightly biased because of the Scottishness. I don't think Hercules has done enough to replace Robertson yet, yet he always seems to be getting that chance, so we shall see if Robertson comes on there and he can make some sort of effect in the game going forward. Gerkes says only one spin left to do in the game so far. Well, it is Romeo Lavia coming on for Chelsea, for what is only his second appearance of the season. If you know anything about Chelsea, you know what a rough time he's had with injuries. So, Gerkes is off, of course, with Robertson coming on, and the other change sees Kanaltec being withdrawn for Liverpool. So, Curtis Jones and Robertson coming on, and Virgil van Dijk is just now in discussions with Gravenberg and Sobozlai. So, it would appear that Gravenberg is going to play alongside van Dijk in central defence. Well, both central defence have really been mixed up, and of course, when Chelsea are doing that because they've got an injury, I don't think Kanaltec's injured perhaps. Well, he ran off the pitch. Exactly. It may well be that there's a temptation that Liverpool may be trying to go to a back three, try to leave it more positive, because Chelsea are very cleverly, keep on talking about this 4-1-4-1 they've played, but because they've got 4-1, then 4 in front, i.e. 2 central midfield players, it's killed the ability for Liverpool to get their players like Gravenberg and Mac Callister on the ball. Because they can't get on the ball, they can't control the game. So, tactically at the moment... James was in trouble there, he mis-controlled the ball, and then he clattered into the challenge, but against Gackpool, referee Taylor allows play to continue. They're both OK. It was one of those where I did wonder for a moment that one of them might have come off badly, but they're OK, Liverpool with it on the left-hand side. We're going to go to the Super League play-off semi-final when we get a chance, but Chelsea breaking away, that's one very well backed by Jones though, just whipped it away, dragged it away from the path of Neto, and took it on into centre-field. Left out of the England squad yesterday by Thomas Ducal, but mentioned into dispatch as Curtis Jones, and that's a tour pass from Mac Callister, straight out of play for a throwing to Chelsea. So, let's get the latest from Chris Kupac. It's game on, John. Hulk, AR 12, St Helen 6, from absolutely nothing, Dion Cross has scored, St Helen's first try. The first time they'd even got within 10 yards of the Rovers' line. Johnny Lomax has popped over the extras as well, just one score in it now, 12-6. In the prem, it's now Saracen's 31 Bristol, 0, that's a later score. That was a 5-25 kick-off. Long pass from Sancho, downfield, brilliant touch from Garnachal, takes him into the penalty area and squares it across the box, and there's no-one there to get a touch. Drow Pedro was the closest, not able to. It's actually been collected again for Chelsea by Pedro Neto. Neto on his left foot, Lavia, then in comes the challenge for Liverpool to win it back, and they lose it, Gackball, dispossessed by Gusto, and then a heavy touch from Fernandez, Liverpool play for Sobozlai. This is for Salot, a chase, but Sanches is right on the edge of his penalty area. And the Chelsea goalkeeper could collect. But how noticeable? Only to one pass straight over Sobozlai's head, because as a midfielder, you have to get in your position right when you play the right full-back. You cannot step a yard out of place. If you get it wrong, the wingers away, and it's a specialist position. He's completely got out of position there, and Garnachal has done well, but should have done even better than that and picked out a blue shot in the centre when he put it in. So, Chelsea won Liverpool Nile, and we have James and Aachenpong as the Chelsea central defenders, and Gravenberg and Van Dijk as the Liverpool central defenders. That's a nice touch by Hvertz. He's spun away there from Caissedo, but Lavia is able to win it back for Chelsea, and now, ends up Fernandez, sets off four, gives it into the path of Cucarera, who passes it forward to Garnachal on the left wing, Garnachal back to the overlapping, Cucarera to the byline, here comes the cross, and it's headed over by Pedro Neto at the back post, via a deflection off the head of Robertson for Chelsea corner. Chelsea, no. They absolutely know there's a problem in the right back area for Liverpool. Now, you can see, I'm actually looking at Sobozlai there, he's saying, is anyone going to come and help me? At some point in time, that's twice since he's gone back to right field back there, but he's been basically destroyed by Chelsea, and down there, he was 2v1 on that occasion, and Chelsea can smell a weakness there. Liverpool vulnerable, some set pieces this season, the corner to our right, and just here, through the gap, a purpley sunset, away in the distance, across west London, as the corner is taken by Pedro Neto and the thoughts of an e-post, and it's headed away by Virgil van Dijk for Liverpool. Chelsea still lead by one goal to nil, we are almost an hour into the match now, and Chelsea scored after 15 minutes. Line's open for 6-0-6 on 08, 08, 5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, hashtag BBC 6-0-6, text 85058 at your standard message rate match of the day tonight, and also on BBC Sounds, the new football interview this week is with Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike, so search football daily on the BBC Sounds app, and you will find that as Chelsea played out from Sanchez, Gravenberg just hoisted up in the air almost to our eye level, headed forward by van Dijk, that's taken down by Caesero, who picks out the pass to Cucarrea, pair flying, he then stops, passes it in field to Fernandez, now here's Lavia as well, I suppose the introduction of Lavia, okay yes they've lost one of the central defenders, but now you've got Lavia and Caesero as the two in central midfield with Gusto at right back, Liverpool win it back, Vert, then the ball in field from Roberts, and that's just presented it back to Chelsea again, and the Chelsea fans are urging their team on, and the second goal here, they want a bit of security, Fernandez to Gannacho, Gannacho, beats Sopo's Lai, still in possession, but running actually right across the field into the middle of the Liverpool half, and then forward from Gusto, turned out to the right-hand side, Pedro Neto, Pedro Neto, left with a ball into the box towards the back, POST, and it is cleared away of a fashion by Sopo's Lai, well, so Fernandez was arriving there and Sopo's Lai, I think was a little fortunate. He was incredibly fortunate, he didn't look behind, Fernandez came in right behind him, and he left it, and it just went through ends of Fernandez's leg there. If you're a fullback, you need to know everything behind you, he did, didn't you? I love Sopo's Lai as a player. I'm not over impressed by him as a right fullback, as you can probably tell. I think he just got a touch, he was looking to sweep it away, and I think he maybe just got a little touch, which meant that he hit Fernandez and bounced behind. Into the last half hour of this match, with Arsenal now at the top of the table, Chelsea leading Liverpool here by one goal to nil, the champions facing another defeat, Sopo's Lai though to the byline, Tzatz Gakpo scores in the six-yard box, took this chance at Liverpool a level, and it was Sopo's Lai, the standing right back there, searching for it, who put in the cross, and Cody Gakpo with the finish in the six-yard box, and it's Chelsea one, Liverpool one. First of all, Sopo's Lai who's basically taken apart as a defender, player in the second half, put him up front, in the right wing position almost, brilliant guest to the byline, creates the goal, he's had him completely created the goal, good ball he puts in there, trying to see if it was exact, whose first touch brings it down beautifully, right onto the foot of Gakpo, he's only a couple of yards out, he can scarcely miss that one, and he has roofed it from five yards. Well, that's about the relief for Liverpool, which is to be fair, they could have been 3-0 down, to start the same half. They could, yeah, crucial little touch from Isak in there, that was certainly a contribution with his back to goal, just a touch, and it fell perfectly into the path of Gakpo, arriving on the edge of the six-yard box, as you say, a path, to roof it into the Chelsea net, and it is all square now, and beautifully poised for the remainder of this match. You get a feeling both teams are going to go for it, as one of those ones, Tim, in the past, you thought, either or possibly both might think, yeah, points not bad, it's good enough, doesn't look like that with these two teams, I think they both feel as if, A, they have to win it, and B, the fancy they can. Yeah, and Chelsea having to make the change in central defence, where the injuries have really hit them, despite the sides of their squad, with James and Atchampong, Atchampong had to change position as well, didn't he, from the right-sided, central defender, the left-sided, and Liverpool have found a way through. I don't think I would question the other centre-backs there, I think just a really good overlap from Shovezlai from the right-back area, got in a good position. You know, he's really changed it there, because he wants to play forward, and you look at him, he's nowhere near marking as a right-back now, he's dumping Ghanaisu, so he's saying, okay, I'm not going to do that, we'll need to go man-for-man at the back, so that's very poised for Liverpool. That is Pat Nevin with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live, twice Chelsea's player of the year, Scotland International, and you were with Liverpool in midweek, when they weren't able to come up with the equaliser in what you told me, was the loudest atmosphere that you've ever heard in a football ground. Exactly, absolutely, and that's quite a big quote to make, you think of all the Everton Liverpools, all the derbies you get in London, Scotland England games, Celtic Rangers, all the European Cup games at Celtic Park, all those things. I think that noise there on that just about topped them all, it was incredible. I saw Ian yesterday, and Ian Dennis, and he said, he said, more or less the same thing. Chelsea won, Liverpool won, just seen a little replay of the goal. I don't think we can understate Isaac's role in that. He has gone out, Joe, into the Liverpool penalty area across the box, but cleared away by Andy Robertson, who is standing in front of Pedro Neto. I love this rescue award, John, because Shabuazla is going to beat every time, but he also can do things going forward. Vert rolls the ball into the space, Salah runs onto this, Salah on his left foot, oh, he's got it all wrong. And actually, well, the flag, has the flag on it. Yeah, he was offside. I'm absolutely convinced of his offside. I haven't even heard the flag in three hours. I mean, Chelsea took me far. I mean, it's a very open game, and it's the kind of game if you're in neutral, you're lovin', because that is now open, you have no idea what way this game's going to go now. They're looking for it. Chelsea have got another play of going down in Chelsea. They're not acting. Is it at your point? It can't be no extent a back. What is incredibly un-looking? If it is, you'll have to say, possibly a lot of you are back there. You know, possibly Casino could play in there. It is. It's at Chimpong, who's down, who's sitting with his legs wide apart, and the Chelsea medical people are right. And now, you know, if before Enzo Moresca and his coaches looked exasperated, then times that by three. He's pacing around with his hands in his pockets. So, well, we've got a stoppage. Let's see what the latest is in that big game in the Premier League. Hartz, Cabe, Gavin Wallace. 52 on the clock. It's still 0-0 at the moment. The first half is the same as the second. Both teams still trying to take control of this. There was a lot of meat, but not much in the way of Bones, and it stays that way 0-0. And from Edinburgh to the Super League playoff, Chris Cooper. Still, Holkiar 12, St Helens 6, and Helens getting right back into it with that try. But giving away a couple of silly penalties, but Rhys Martins not being able to capitalise. He went for the two, didn't get them, still 12, 6 rovers. In the Prem, Saracens 38, Bristol 5. In the National League, Skunkthorpe, Neil Carlyle won the later score. And yes, Pat at Chimpong cannot complete the match. He's having to be substituted. Chelsea have now lost both of their central defenders in this match with a long list of central defenders already on the injured list. Well, the two that started were probably the choices, 4-5, 1-2 and 3, Ben Engel. So that's 4-5 out now. Now, what they've brought in now is Hato is going to play out C, less centre-back. Now, he's capable of doing that, but he's very young. And they're having a couple of mistakes when he's had his little chances so far. But you've now got him and Rhys James as the centre-backs. He's that most thing. Give me a chance. Come in the ball. I'll find out if these two can play together. Yep, the Dutch international. Jarell Hato has come on to play alongside James. Chelsea with Gusto. Gusto's ball into the box, took a flick off ahead. Bounces down for Garnaccio. Garnaccio then back out of the box to Cucarrea. And Garnaccio is forced away by Subos Lai. And back to the halfway line and the newly arrived Hato plays it to James. And it goes all the way back to goalkeeper Sanchez. Frustration there. And in fact, the pass out, Lavia was in danger of losing it. Actually, Liverpool's goal scorer Gattor does have it back in the central third. Now Andy Robertson tears forward down the left, his ball into the box. That is intercepted by James. Then a challenge by Gusto on Robertson inside the box. I think he got enough of the ball there. But the Liverpool fans at that end thought for a moment that could have been a penalty. Chelsea though, take it away over the halfway line. Pedro Neto, the space there for Cucarrea. Cucarrea immediately looks to Garnaccio. He's up against Subos Lai. Garnaccio, low ball to Fernandez on the edge of the box. Enzo Fernandez, Chelsea man's gone down inside the penalty area, holding his head. It's Pedro Neto, still play continues. VAR will be having a look at that. And then Lavia's pass, actually Hato will do well to keep that in. He does. And Chelsea go back to the halfway line. And Pedro Neto is now back on his feet. He's using his shirt sleeve to wipe his nose perhaps. And suggesting that he was caught by a flailing Liverpool arm in the box. He was not having a complaint at any particular player. So you wonder if that was one of those ones where you knew he was just running on your head. He said, we didn't see it. No doubt we'll be... I'm not seeing any signs that they're having a look at it with the VAR yet. Chelsea won, Liverpool won. And Natalie Pike and Chris Sutton are waiting for your calls on 6-0-6, 08, 08-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3 to join in with the programme. Here is Joao Pedro, but his pass forward is deflected, actually. Hit to McAllister, that took it away all the way through to Mamadashvili to pick it up. So Chelsea took the lead in the first half through Caesero, but Cody Gakpo equalising just past the hour mark. And this match is poised at 1-1, lovely pass forward for Jones to run on to. Gravenberg with the initial pass, Jones then to Saller on the right-hand side, a cross for the outside of his boot, Jones tries to get his head to it, flick away to Gakpo, still inside the Chelsea box, it's laid up to McAllister, who drives it for that block inside the penalty area, to McAllister who overhits it through for Golkin. Brilliant, I mean Chelsea attacking with three players there in the Liverpool box, I would say about six seconds later, there's a half chance there for Liverpool, well blocked down there, and McCaster caught that one very, very well. But there's masses of space out there, many teams over the last five, six, seven years, if we go and see games in the Premier League and there's no space, and it's a bit dull, and it's a bit dry. There's so many open games at the moment, and this is absolutely one of them. So, 1-1, as we said before the match, two teams playing in this match who certainly don't want to lose this, and it's level at 1-1, but they are going for it, Kukareya now, as Chelsea launch another attack, Garnaccio back to Kukareya, Crosscoons got back, fall all the way across the box, but Robertson was there, actually Zhuao Pedro was challenged by Van Dijk, went down, but again, shouts for penalty in the stands, but not on the pitch, and now a pass over the top for Liverpool. This is the stereotypical end-to-end match, and Vert allows the ball to run to Salah, and then Salah back to the halfway line. What a shame for Verts, and a great possession there, but he basically felt, Salah's a main miner, need to let him get it, because that happened, slowed all the play down, Salah's a wee bit further behind, and it just kills all the momentum. Because what they know, I say it's 1-1, probably at the end of the match, 1-1 would be deemed as a good result, but the players on the pitch know that both oppositions have got makeshift defences, Van Dijk, so it's worth having a go, Rhys James, it tangles with Isaac, who goes down inside the box, Liverpool fans are howling and saying that James fouled him, hauled him over, James goes through his feet, motions that Isaac should get up, he's still on the ground, Anthony Taylor's not interested. He's not interested, but that's not the important part, the VER are interested. Wow, oh, there should they be. It looked like from where we were, lots of flailing arms. The tangle of flailing arms, and an arm does catch Isaac in the face. Rhys James is going to walk over to him now and offer him a hand to help him up, which he kind of reluctantly takes when he's hauled to his feet. You know what? Liverpool didn't get a penalty, it did get a penalty given against them in Europe for an incredibly similar thing, Gáil-Tássaraí, and it's a difference between what you get in Europe and what you get in the Premier League. That is so light, the penalty was given against Liverpool, it's incredibly light. That is going to be the last action for Alexander Isaac, he's booed off by the Chelsea supporters, and Ekateke, who ex-sanded us, he was out of this match yesterday, who got Ekateke, here he comes running onto the field. So Isaac, how do you feel he did today generally? It's hard, you didn't get a lot at the ball, not enough at the ball for him to make a chip. No, to me, a huge, huge difference to the game, but his little touches are great, like they always are. Very, very impressive, he will get better, there's no doubt. I'm going to see a triple change for Chelsea. The teenager, Mark Grillo, is going to come on for Jouel Pedro, so the number 38 takes his place up front, and that is Garnaccio being replaced by Jamie Gittins. Another of the summer arrivals, one replacing the other. A double change it is, not a triple change. So Jamie Gittins runs over there to the far side, signed from Borussia Dortmund for in the region of £50m. I haven't counted it up, but there are an awful lot of... Did you mention Estavao from Neto? No, I didn't. So it was a triple change. Estavao is on. The number 41, the 18-year-old Brazilian international, who also, if all of the clauses come together, will cost over £50m, £50m plus players everywhere you look on the pitch. If you're away on the stage, you're close to £50m. It's the going rate. So the number 41 is on. First time I've seen him live, Pat, looking forward to this. Chelsea, I know he's very much your cup of tea. Here he is for the first time, and you can feel the expectation. Inside Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea fans, that lovely lift of a sort of wow noise. Gusto back to Estavao, turns full 360 degrees, curls it in, attempted flick, but that's blocked by the Liverpool defender. That comes off Robertson. Labya putting him under pressure, and it's a corner to Chelsea. One-on-the-score. I'm so delighted you have that noise. It is a really special noise you get when certain types of players get the ball. These Chelsea fans have seen little bits of it, and they know what he's capable of. So deliverable, by the way, they're banged up two against, one against them. Corner is taken short by Chelsea. It's given back to Estavao, and this willowy young man looks to cross it, which he does into Robertson, which deflects it straight behind for another corner. So it's well Pedro. It's a whole friend line. Neto, Gior Pedro and Gennacho all go off. Youngster's coming on. That's a lovely thing. Here's Estavao again after the corner was taken short once more. They did work brilliantly, didn't they? One corner in the first half that Gennacho went close from it. Absolutely fantastic. Given away by Estavao, and now passed forward, Liverpool by Gacto, but Cucaraya is able to dispossess Vert, and then Estavao goes down, or thought that was a foul by Gacto. Referee Taylor doesn't give it. Ball bounces way over to the far side, and Fernandez is able to keep the ball in, waggles his foot over the ball, Cristiano Ronaldo side, before he passes it in field. The score is 1-1. We're into the last 15 minutes of this match now, and they are going for it, these two teams. There'll be plenty to talk about with Natalie Pike and Chris Sutton on 08-5, 9-9-6-9-3 on 6-06. Robertson dispossesses Estavao. Now Robertson sets off forward, goes for an early pass, right across the penalty area. Salas chasing this, bounces down in the Chelsea left-back area, and Cucaraya in the end finds it bouncing up in front of him, and he wags it into the stand. This is so more Salas, isn't it? He's did very little in the first half. He wasn't chasing back, he wasn't using his energy, and now he thinks, right, OK, I've conserved, I'm going to have a go at it now. You can see that he's got much more energy than you think he had, because he was just waiting for the space to open up, and it has to some degree. I think it might have been when one of the penalty shots took place. I looked at the screen here, and the camera's focused on a woman. There's Liverpool plate forward, but it's cut out by Gusto, who's able to carry the ball forward, and then Passdenfield Fernandez slides in, Subos lies there, oh, he blasts the ball into Cucaraya from close range, and he goes down, and he kicked the ball. They were out, it was sort of impact at the same time. Subos lies kick, ball, Cucaraya, and it's a yellow card, and I think that has been shown to Subos lie because of excessive force. Well, if he gets the ball there, he just looks like he had tackled to me. Again, we'll see it, if he's close to it there. Yeah, he's almost... That's not a tackle, he's actually like a shot. D'Bernes, he absolutely has not touched Cucaraya there. He's got the ball clean. Now, Cucaraya may well have twisted his ankle as he got the ball. Subos lies just kept the ball. I think that's an extraordinary, really harsh yellow card for Subos lie. Chelsea won, Liverpool won. So did you see who the woman was? At the point where I wanted to see a replay of the incident, there was an urgency to show this woman in the stand, and it turns out it's Madonna. Oh, really? Madonna has done the bridge. She... Here is Lavia, passing the ball here. Gittins, Jenny Gittins up against Subos lie. He's the latest man to try now. In fact, Fernandez has gone across, deflected all the way across the face of goal. Then Gravenberg got a touch on that. It could easily have deflected in, in fact, they've deflected across the six-yard box, and behind for another corner to Chelsea. Every time Chelsea get down the left, they get to the bioline, they get across every single time. Corner is taken short again, though, and here is Estaval, Estaval with the ball at his feet, and behind him, it is... ...the Caissedo who tries to take it round the outside, but loses out, and good work by Ekati Khe, who is able to get a deflection on that, and it's out of play for a throw-in to Liverpool, back to the Super League play-off, semi-final, Chris Cooper. Hulkingston-Rover sensing victory, 16-6. Another try, this time from Oliver Gildard, following a long kick down the left-hand side, long delay while the Ravidia referee confirmed it, the extra's not added, 16-6. Commentary on sports extra. Gatpo down the left wing into the box, then Leesit back to the edge of the area, Ekati Khe's shot was blocked, Subos lie shot is blocked, but now passes it straight through opponent LaVillette, who's able to clear it out for a throw on the far side. Again, you're hearts in your mouth, you're very Chelsea-fine, because they were looking at brilliant positions seconds ago, Liverpool break, but they just can't seem to get a break, good closing down by the Chelsea defenders, but that's very disappointing when he's passing that occasion. Saracen's 43 Bristol fly, there's the latest score in the prem, Ekati Khe on the edge of the area, set it up, Vurt, clips it across, now Gatpo inside the box, back to the edge of the penalty area, ran away from Vurt's heavy touch, Chelsea were able to clear, it's still 1-1 here at Stamford Bridge on five-live in the last ten minutes of this Premier League match, and all eyes on the action. It is a very good spectacle. Van Dijk to Robertson. If you asked me to put my neck on the line, Pat, I would be saying it's going to finish 1-1, but with Liverpool's results in the late goals... Yeah, he has Gatpo down the left, challenged by Gusto, I thought that might have been a foul, but he came out with the ball, Anthony Taylor says no, and he wins a throw in the Chelsea right back area. Yes, in Liverpool's matches so far this season, from the 83rd minute onwards, there have been eight goals in all competitions. Do you know what is really interesting to see that tackle? Again, he's going over as Slott's got a yellow card in this occasion. But he's going in there, he has got a little bit of the ball, and then Liverpool's play goes over the top of them. From the referee's point of view, and absolutely accept that modern football, modern Premier League, they usually get free kick for that. He's allowing it to flow a bit, isn't he? Slott's second yellow card of the season, he was booked at Crystal Palace last Saturday afternoon, Moresco when he got his in the first half, that's three for him in all competitions. Chelsea attack with Estabal, Estabal manages to find the ball in field, oh, Fernandez tried to let it go, it might have run to Gittins, it got a touch though from Van Dijk, now Chelsea have got it back again inside their own half, and start once more with Gusto, the player that is. And back to Hart's, Habes, Gavin Wallace. Oh, John, I thought we were getting into the groove there, still no, no, Martin Boyle was through one on one, he put it into the back of the net, but it was offside. Hart's now, Habes now. Yes, we got the Madonna river. Gavin's been sitting there waiting for that one. He has Gittins attacking down the left-hand side, in front of the watching Madonna, and then shoots Goal with to Mamadash Villi. Rather spectacularly, he dives to his left and pushes it away, comes out to Estabal, Estabal back into the box, curls it, Goal in, might have been creeping in, Mamadash Villi diving to his right this time, got those orange gloves with it to make sure it didn't corner. So old-school of this, isn't it? Just love it. One side to the other side. Madonna's here, Pat. Oh, yes, I know. Apparently she's a true blue. Oh, my God. Oh, dear me. I wish I could tell you who I stole that from. Well, I suspect that now Phil is sitting, Phil's sitting there to our left. Well done, Phil. He's got his hood pulled down, but I can see his teeth laughing. It's a corner then to Chelsea, 1-1. Here comes the corner into the six-yard box. Mamadash Villi comes, gets a punch on it, which takes it out of the penalty area to the right-hand side. Gusto, back in possession, back to James. But the pass was slightly astray, so it goes all the way back to the halfway line. Of course, the stars of stage and screen have traditionally come here, haven't they? Gusto. Ford Estabauer inside the box, lovely footwork on his left foot. Still going, plays it back out, and then the offside fly is open. Estabauer puts his palms apart, as if to say, if I'd known the flag was going to come up, I wouldn't have tried all of those tricks. To be honest, again, it's been really entertaining. The fact is Chelsea are playing a much more open game now, with just a one-setting match-fielder. It's a big reason why this game has been more open, and there's a large space for the players to show the skills a lot of that much. Chelsea 1, Liverpool 1. Oh, given away, given away by Gravenberg. Estabauer, now the chance for Gwil, but it ran away from him with the touch, and Mamadash Villi slid out, and was able to collect it quite comfortably, actually. And now, Liverpool on the move again. We're into the last five minutes now, but Gatpole played a pass for the run that never came from Robertson, but he's not giving this up, and he has won it back. Robertson on the dead-ball line. Gatpole with the cross, but poor easy catch for goalkeeper Sanchez. That's unusual from Kaisido that. He thought he was going to be strong enough, but he looked at it enough, Robertson. Chelsea now, here they come. That's asking a lot of Gittons. I'm not sure he's going to reach it. No, the pass forward from Fernandez. He apologises, just put too much on it, and it bounces through in between the stewards who are sitting there in their yellow and orange jackets, which gives you an indication that we're not far away from the end of this match, and the score level at 1-1. So, 6-0-6, not far away. 08, 08-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3 to join in with Natalie Pike and Chris Sutton. Still hearts, 0-0, Hames Nail. Coming on to replace McAllister in the midfield. So, I think that gives you a little bit of an indicator of how Arnaut Slott is thinking. Well, a couple of things. McAllister, you know, he's trying to protect him a bit. He needs a lot of rest. He was saying that over in Istanbul during the week there. It's had to use him for 80-odd minutes, but he's not doing that much of a massive effect in games like he has in the past and controlling them, and that may well be because he's playing against, but ultimately, it will be quite a 100% right yet. Chelsea won Liverpool won. And all of tomorrow's matches, you'll be able to hear in one place or another the Premier League matches, all of the top sport covered. Kukereya is fouled by Salah, so there's a cheer of, that's a little win, free kick to Chelsea inside their own half. And Newcastle, Nottingham Forest from two, and Brentford, Manchester City from four-thirty are the five live commentary matches, but commentary on all of them, some place or other, whether it's Sports Extra, Sports Extra Two, or indeed via the BBC website and app. One-one. Long pass forward from James, headed forward by Robertson. Gakpo, the Liverpool goal scorer, his second goal of the season, and a lovely little touch from Isaac to set it up after the cross from Sabao's lie, a ball out of play for a throw-in on the halfway line. Gusto gets it back after taking the throw and will go all the way back to Hato, who's under pressure here. Hato had to stand up there, which he does and then takes it away, well played under pressure. Passes it for DeLavia, and Lavia's ball through the left-hand side. Gittings could be in for the first touch, was really poor, and Sabao's lie was able to get back, take the ball away, and it was cleared out of play on the far side. One of those brown moments, Hato was under pressure, he drew in five players and took the ball out of play, hence the space that developed for Chelsea. Yeah, they come again, though, Chelsea, but that attempted cross was blocked by the recently arrived substitute, Endo. Then it's run back on the edge of the area by Hato. Hato's ball into the box for Chelsea, looking for Guillieu, it's cleared away, Taissedo's going to have another goal! He flies over the top of the crossbar, Manadas really got a touch to it with his fingertips, wasn't 100% sure, helped it over, corner Chelsea. You and I come to this place now and again, I come here with Dehnuk, but quite often, in the last few minutes, you see lots of people leaving. I haven't seen anyone leaving this one, with a minute and a half to go. No, well, the Chelsea fans and the Liverpool fans are not the best of friends. Are they? This rivalry that's been set up, if you're a supporter of theirs, the winning goal if it comes. Here's the corner which is cleared away at the near post-4 Liverpool. The Chelsea again, corner taker Estavao back to James. James curls it in nicely, headed goalwards, but caught by Namagrashvili, diving to his right. Back to the Super League play-off, Chris Kuba. OK, our fans can start to think about Old Trafford. 24-6 they now lead St Helens, subject to the video referee's review of the Burgess try. Good to me. Oliver Guildhardt, though, his try definitely counted. Martin couldn't add the extras. It's either 26 or it is. It's been disallowed. It's Holkiar 20, St Helens 6. They still need three scores. Commentary on Sports Extra, Liverpool quick breakaway pass. Set-up, Suppers lie on the edge of the area, but a weak shot actually went wide. Well, they had run the entire length of the baseman from right back there, but it was another very good chance. We've just seen a few moments. Long pass forward, looking for the run of Estabal, but too close to Namagrashvili, and Estabal has smuggled it out of the grasp of Namagrashvili, so that's a free kick. Also ends up Fernandez's down, and getting back to his feet. Ball forward to Ekatikay, but that is covered by Hato, and headed back to his goalkeeper. And seven minutes of added time. Well, there have been obviously plenty of substitutions and a couple of injuries. Bayern Munich are on the way to victory. Luis Diaz has scored a second goal. Harry Kane got the other one there, 3-0 up. Frank Ferd and Chelsea with Jamie Gittins passing the ball across the pitch to Gusto. Several Chelsea players out there have played in a variety of positions during the course of this match. Same applies to Liverpool as well. Lavia forward from him. Now here is Estabal again. Andi Robertson goes for the early cross. Headed wide by the arriving Fernandez. He had to adjust, and because of that, he couldn't head it on target. He headed it wide from six yards. How many times, again, Schobersleih, you have to keep your eyes behind you. If you have great fullback, you're not looking at the ball coming in, you're looking at who's running behind you. And he just runs straight past Schobersleih, and gets a completely free header. Well, suddenly, I let the two fullbacks, one of them being Graham Leso beforehand, he knew how to do that job. He's quite specialised, you need to keep your eyes on him. Yeah, and he was a little... You just missed time to run past him, otherwise. Lovely ball in, got the outside of the post. Lovely ball in by Estabal, though. Very difficult to defend. It was Chelsea won, Liverpool won. We're in seven minutes of added time. We'll wrap things up. 06, 08, 08, 05, 9, 09, 6, 9, 3. Fernandez. Oh, no. He tried to adjust his body, pass it forward for Gittings, and then over-hit the pass. He's blaming Gettings-Up. Absolutely not. Gettings-Up has latched onto that. That would have been... Super-sonic. I think I was going to say. So everyone on the edge of their seat, including Madonna. Chelsea won, Liverpool won. I suspect she's not on the edge of their seat, actually. She was very much languishing. It's a place to read yourself. It's Western Town, as well, isn't it? I've never seen her, yet. I don't think she's got the game necessarily. No, here is Gatko. Gatko, brilliantly. Dispossessed by Estabelle, who passes the ball through the middle for Fernandez to chase. Even with his brilliant physical powers, he couldn't reach that, going at full tilt. And it was all the way through to Mamadash Billy. That ball was on, though. He's won the ball, Estabelle. He's got his eyes off, he's seen the right pass. He just couldn't deliver it. In that situation, don't play in front of the player. Play on his feet and ask him to deal with it. Gatko now cutting in field. His pass was actually intercepted by the Taelas Estabelle running back into his own penalty area. Back to the rugby league, Chris Cooper. Getting tense. Hulkingston Rovers 20, St Helens 12. Harry Robertson with a try. Another lengthy delay for the video ref. Extra is added by Lomax. They need two tries. They've got five minutes. And now Curtis Jones finds some space to shoot over the top from an angle right side of the penalty area. Looks to the heavens. It's not an easy opportunity. He has an angle there. But you want to get it on target. You want to ask the goalkeeper a question. Love a little dummy. Keep it down, keep it on target. If the keeper saves it, it might go out to one of your own players. But he just got a little bit too excited there when he seen the goals in front of him. It was an angle, it was tough. But you've got to get it on target. And the rugby union, Saracens 43, Bristol 12. Now, and we've got Pat. Three minutes of added time to play. Anthony Taylor gives a free kick against Gittins. Liverpool... We're in on the slot team, aren't we now? Yes, we are. Slotage time, as they call it. Liverpool have not won here for... Well, it's over five years now. Tavik with Iketike, who hits a nice little ball through for Robertson, who took a touch, but then Kaiseido coming across to make sure that that was going to run all the way behind for a goal pick. Right back at Kaiseido again. We did similar with Robertson, who actually pushed a minute of mistake about ten minutes ago. He wasn't going to do it again. Kaiseido seen the danger. Mithuri killed it, which was stone dead. One-one, Chelsea coming forward again. A draw has been a popular result between these sides in those five years. Three of the four matches played. Now Gittins again, Gittins back to the edge of the penalty area. Fernandez, Fernandez with the ball inside the box, plays it for Kukareya. Cross-court, and the gentleman... Estabal with the winner! Sliding in in the six-yard box. What a time for the 18-year-old to score his first goal for Chelsea. And then Joe Mareska has set off and going to show Zebra Rino all the way down the touchline to congratulate the 18-year-old. It looks like Chelsea have snatched it almost right at the end, and that Liverpool are facing three defeats in eight days. Two-one, Chelsea. Well, Chelsea probably had slightly better chances in this game. But they went down the left-hand side again. It's been just too easy. Every single time they go down that left-hand side, they get to the back line, they get across, and I'm chilling out, they haven't had anybody who's trapped that back post and willing to take the chance to get in there. And Estabal, the oldest one in the book, just gets to the back post, if it arrives there, then you've got to open. He gets there, he's a very young player, but what a massive, massive moment it is there. We lovely play that left-hand side for Chelsea. They're looking for an offside there. I can't see any offside about it at all. It's Tukarela who puts the ball in for the top-end for Estabal. Estabal sliding in, Robertson stretching with him, but the teenager got there first, and from a little bit of an angle, right side of the six-yard box, was able to force it in, and they're just showing us pictures again. And that is a full-blown sprint from Muresca to leap under the shoulders of Estabal and Chelsea, winning by two goals to one. I don't think Chelsea would care about the red card from Muresca. He was on a yellow already, so he can't run down there to do anything except get the red card. Yeah, second yellow for... I think it's fair to say that he left the technical area there. By about 50 yards. He almost left FW six minutes. If he kept going like that, he'd be halfway down the Fulham Road by now. Wrong side, John. Salescourt was heading towards the... Good point. That's that way. Just watching it. Liverpool are going to try everything they can. They've only got seconds left. They've got Virgil van Dijk playing centre-forward now. But even for Liverpool, this is a big, big ask to get our last-moment goal. Chelsea now closing in on what will be their first Premier League win since August. And what a win it will be for them. The FIFA Club World Cup winners about to beat the Premier League champions in Liverpool facing their second Premier League defeat of the season. London Sellers Park last weekend. London, Stamford Bridge this weekend. And there can only be seconds left now. Anthony Taylor blows the whistle and that's it. It's over. Estabelle's goal in the sixth minute of added time has won it for Chelsea and beaten the Premier League champions. And Liverpool have scored there. So many late-winning goals themselves this season have been done by one here at Stamford Bridge today. Chelsea 2-1 winners. Well, in a season of very, very late goals, not just by Liverpool, it's happened against Liverpool. Obviously at Crystal Palace as well. But this time it's Chelsea. They've kept going. They look stronger and stronger at the end. And what they did, the rest have decided to go for a youth. Three attack-minded players brought on, all young, and one of them, Estabelle, gets into that back post and scores the goal. I mind you, there's a lot of pressure before this game. If they win this game, people forget that pressure for quite some time. And in top of that, Chelsea played very, very well today under difficult circumstances. Well, it looks like that one opens up the league a little bit. Rather Arsenal stay top of the league. Virgil van Dijk is leading the Liverpool players towards those Liverpool fans who are still inside the ground. Arnaz Lotz as well. Pat Arnaz Lotz just lost three in the row for his first time as the Liverpool manager. Yeah, it's never always going to go completely smooth when he starts to finish his win the league in his first season. He's had to change the squad up a little bit, you know, and he's had to change things up changing as well. Remember, as Arnaz Lotz said himself, Liverpool have got this big, gigantic target on the back now. Everybody wants to beat him. And this, I watched Galatasaray's. People celebrate as if they win the Champions League. The Champions League final has been Liverpool. Chelsea fans have celebrated when the Champions League final were being Liverpool. And that's the problem you've got if you are the champions. That's why it's hard to retain your title in this. And as any of you today, Chelsea fans are delighted that Liverpool fans are concerned. Arsenal fans will be off the scale, happy to snout. This is not often something you see when Chelsea have just won a match. The fireworks went off inside the ground and real signs of celebration all around Stamford Bridge. And that's absolutely it, Pat. You know, Liverpool having won the league so well last season and then spent the best part of half a billion pounds on new players. I mean, it's not panic stations, of course, by any means. But their next match after the international window is Manchester United at Anfield. 6-0-6 on the way, by the way. 08-0-8-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3 for the poles to Natalie Pike and Chris Sutton will be going there shortly. Final word, Pat. Really enjoyable game and one of the great things about the Premier League this season is there are a lot of teams playing very, very open football, not going for draws. Keep going until the last minute, until the last seconds. And in this game today, no-one's going to be clever, clever. It could have been Liverpool that scored the last minute winner. It was Chelsea that scored the last minute winner. And I suspect that the many teams are playing this now. Let's see how OK it can continue all the way to the end of the season. Yeah, fitted scenes of celebration still around Stamford Bridge. Pat, thank you very much for your company. Once again, here at Stamford Bridge. We also need to wrap things up in the Super League play-off semi-final. Chris Cooper. Scenes of celebration here. John for Hulkingston Rovers because they've beaten St Halleins by 20 points to 12, but slightly muted. They're going back to Old Trafford, a repeat of last year's grand final against Wigan. They've won nothing yet, but the treble is very much on. They totally blitz sakes in the first half, tries from Lewis and Burgess. In the second half, two from Gelhardt, ensure that the St Helens fight back was going to be minimal and inconsequential. Hulkingston Rovers, 20, St Helens, 12. And what about Hart's hips, Gavin Wallace? What about Hart's hips, Gavin Wallace? So, last we heard, the score was Hart's nil, Hibs nil. I'm just going to see if I can update that for you. It is indeed the score, Hart's nil, Hibs nil, the 545 kick-off, so a little while to go in that match, but the Chelsea players, the celebrate and Chelsea players have only now, I'm just saying, estival, the game is over. The celebrate and Chelsea players have only now, I'm just saying, estival, the man who today has scored his first goal for Chelsea, the 18-year-old, the summer signing from Palmeiras. What a day for him in his ninth appearance for Chelsea. He doesn't want to go, they're still scoring him down the tunnel. One of the things I would say about estival, it wasn't brilliant to come on today, but every time any Chelsea player gets a ball, they try and find him. That tells you a story about a player. An 18-year-old, everybody wants to get them involved. Every time they've got it, it tells you what he's capable of and what he's doing in training, he's going to be special. Yes, he is, he's got something about him, no question. And I can tell you in the national league, it did finish Skunkle United nil, Carl Eilig United won. So, five lives tomorrow on Premier League Sunday, we'll have all of the top sport covered. And all of the Premier League matches, you'll be able to hear commentary in one place or another.
