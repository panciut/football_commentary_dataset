[0.00 - 5.60] P:1748.15 E:0.075720 |  Then Nani on the right, Anderson Cleverly, Young, Welbeck and Rooney.
[5.60 - 9.88] P:1822.47 E:0.150242 |  And the Manchester United bench today includes people like Ferdinand Berbatov,
[9.88 - 12.68] P:1759.69 E:0.143834 |  Giggs and Hernandez on the Arsenal bench.
[12.68 - 16.72] P:1730.79 E:0.145796 |  Well, young men like Ozzy Yakup and Sunoo,
[16.72 - 20.44] P:1713.99 E:0.146705 |  who neither of whom has appeared in the Premier League.
[20.44 - 24.84] P:1774.30 E:0.143939 |  So Manchester United will play to Autiel Strepeden in the first half and right to left.
[24.84 - 29.68] P:1774.21 E:0.144000 |  Howard Webb is the referee, Arsenal in the chainstrip with Navy Blue and Turquoise.
[30.16 - 33.20] P:1866.28 E:0.125356 |  And we're about to get underway.
[34.08 - 36.12] P:1699.30 E:0.122667 |  Mark, final thought before the game?
[36.80 - 39.28] P:1770.54 E:0.151992 |  I just think Arsenal need to be really strong here, mate.
[39.28 - 41.48] P:1653.89 E:0.139660 |  I'm not sure they've got it in them, in all honesty.
[41.48 - 44.20] P:1817.80 E:0.124328 |  They've got so many inexperienced players,
[44.20 - 46.68] P:1714.47 E:0.145840 |  it's going to need the better players to play above themselves today
[46.68 - 49.08] P:1830.37 E:0.133148 |  to get any semblance of a positive result.
[49.08 - 52.92] P:1743.03 E:0.145304 |  Sam Alladies saying to us before the game that they need some possession.
[53.84 - 56.56] P:1654.86 E:0.148523 |  And they could really have done with Jack Wilshire out there today
[56.56 - 58.80] P:1622.00 E:0.130647 |  and Song in midfield, but they have to get on with it
[58.80 - 60.48] P:1703.41 E:0.129622 |  on what is quite a blustery afternoon.
[60.48 - 62.52] P:1852.71 E:0.133081 |  Totally misjudged the weather here, by the way.
[62.52 - 65.24] P:1749.24 E:0.133954 |  I thought it was August and it's freezing.
[65.24 - 68.40] P:1939.10 E:0.153334 |  As Clarence, a very nervous Clarence from Shejnay,
[68.40 - 72.28] P:1872.91 E:0.115496 |  is charged down by Danny Welbeck and it's going to be a goal kick to Arsenal.
[72.28 - 75.00] P:1690.86 E:0.131187 |  He just stumbled a little bit on his left foot
[75.00 - 77.16] P:1489.78 E:0.123307 |  and he thought, oh, Cracky, I've got to kick it with my left foot.
[77.16 - 81.84] P:1723.85 E:0.120298 |  And it just bought half a second for Welbeck to close the kick out down.
[83.56 - 85.60] P:1653.15 E:0.150511 |  So welcome to our coverage on Five Live
[85.64 - 88.24] P:1721.37 E:0.124695 |  of Manchester United against Arsenal.
[88.24 - 90.68] P:1733.31 E:0.147003 |  Arsenal yet to score in the Premier League this season.
[90.68 - 94.32] P:1744.41 E:0.123820 |  If they don't do it today, that'll be the first time it's happened since the 50s.
[94.32 - 97.20] P:1750.74 E:0.120632 |  Johnny Evans wearing number six this season.
[97.20 - 98.60] P:1786.42 E:0.156257 |  It used to be 23, of course.
[98.60 - 102.40] P:1813.53 E:0.126538 |  Now, Ashley Young near side, the Manchester United left.
[102.40 - 104.20] P:1760.53 E:0.149960 |  He's got three or four Arsenal players around him
[104.20 - 106.64] P:1906.64 E:0.122511 |  and he works it neatly to Anderson.
[106.64 - 108.52] P:1763.31 E:0.141363 |  Anderson running square with the ball at the moment,
[108.52 - 111.04] P:1715.37 E:0.110207 |  followed by Ramsey inside the centre-circle.
[111.04 - 113.36] P:1830.12 E:0.128264 |  Anderson checks and then he feeds Cleverley.
[113.36 - 115.08] P:1839.82 E:0.122954 |  The first time he's on the ball here.
[115.08 - 116.24] P:1871.25 E:0.154999 |  Cleverley into Welbeck.
[116.24 - 118.52] P:1878.38 E:0.122601 |  Welbeck's ball towards Rooney doesn't reach him.
[118.52 - 121.64] P:1863.87 E:0.128825 |  Juru clears, but it comes straight back to the home side once more.
[121.64 - 126.28] P:1851.08 E:0.126116 |  And the first touch in the game for De Haer outside of the penalty area.
[126.28 - 131.24] P:1916.39 E:0.111500 |  Just knocks it with his foot to Johnny Evans and United just hold.
[131.24 - 133.76] P:1909.52 E:0.117762 |  Ever is urging Evans to get rid of it.
[133.76 - 136.04] P:1827.95 E:0.117489 |  Now, Anderson back again to Evans.
[136.04 - 137.92] P:1787.96 E:0.128524 |  Evans back to goalkeeper De Haer.
[137.92 - 141.00] P:1784.85 E:0.128501 |  I think this Arsenal had sort of gone 4-5-1,
[141.00 - 143.80] P:1803.88 E:0.125939 |  which, I'm personally, would be the one, but on the wings,
[143.80 - 146.24] P:1767.41 E:0.131235 |  they're kind of going to push Walcott on the right forward
[146.24 - 149.12] P:1751.75 E:0.123332 |  and now Chavin on the left forward when they've got the ball
[149.12 - 151.88] P:1766.38 E:0.103693 |  to try and make it a 4-3-3.
[151.88 - 156.24] P:1708.45 E:0.135462 |  Anderson wants more, taking on Ramsey and doing well to hold onto it
[156.24 - 158.64] P:1804.66 E:0.126776 |  because Ramsey was determined in the tackle there
[158.64 - 160.76] P:1722.16 E:0.119788 |  and now Nani for Manchester United.
[160.76 - 164.84] P:1763.30 E:0.132889 |  Nani up against Cochaland, the youngster, looking to try and release Smalling.
[164.84 - 166.40] P:1832.88 E:0.139141 |  Smalling into the penalty area.
[166.40 - 167.72] P:1870.03 E:0.140890 |  Arsenal don't get it away.
[167.72 - 171.20] P:1890.78 E:0.138004 |  Shot from Cleverley just wide and Arsenal didn't deal with that
[171.20 - 173.20] P:1914.80 E:0.133838 |  and it was great running from Chris Smalling
[173.24 - 174.24] P:1875.49 E:0.128352 |  and it's a goal kick.
[174.24 - 177.60] P:1805.44 E:0.125269 |  Great running and strength, Mike, as well, which is very, very important.
[177.60 - 181.52] P:1709.04 E:0.130423 |  Also, when he got himself in the penalty area before he was stumbling,
[181.52 - 184.40] P:1633.40 E:0.144956 |  he saw that Cleverley was just hanging around on the edge of the penalty area
[184.40 - 185.64] P:1654.29 E:0.140673 |  where he played the ball back to him.
[185.64 - 188.64] P:1768.60 E:0.138439 |  He had to hit it early, Cleverley, and hit it with a little bit of pace,
[188.64 - 190.48] P:1740.13 E:0.114338 |  but no direction.
[190.48 - 191.44] P:1690.82 E:0.149194 |  It's very interesting.
[191.44 - 193.20] P:1609.38 E:0.134372 |  Smalling's looking the part at right back.
[193.20 - 197.08] P:1625.03 E:0.125706 |  Of course, they do have Rafael and Fabio as well, the young Brazilians.
[197.08 - 198.72] P:1699.80 E:0.121378 |  Gary Neville now having retired.
[198.72 - 201.68] P:1728.56 E:0.139239 |  The last time United played Arsenal this last season in the FA Cup,
[201.72 - 205.24] P:1679.84 E:0.123594 |  Fabio and Rafael both played as wingers in that game, I remember,
[205.24 - 206.28] P:1578.35 E:0.147542 |  in a 2-0 home win.
[206.28 - 209.24] P:1751.37 E:0.117782 |  Now, Jenkinson stabs the ball towards Van Persie,
[209.24 - 212.84] P:1714.25 E:0.120523 |  easy cut out by Evans and Anderson now into Welbeck.
[212.84 - 214.28] P:1766.97 E:0.094738 |  Good control from him.
[214.28 - 215.92] P:1790.02 E:0.125053 |  Good movement from Manchester United.
[215.92 - 218.24] P:1705.33 E:0.116395 |  Young back to Evans once more
[218.24 - 220.48] P:1763.51 E:0.114589 |  and Evans will give it to goalkeeper De Herre,
[220.48 - 224.60] P:1703.22 E:0.136429 |  just reminding you once again that Manchester City have won 5-1 today away to Spurs.
[224.60 - 228.08] P:1577.71 E:0.126371 |  What's the story of Anne Cochaland and the Arsenal holding midfield player?
[228.08 - 229.28] P:1836.34 E:0.087920 |  Do we know?
[229.32 - 232.76] P:1711.53 E:0.140549 |  Well, he's a player that Arsene Benga, he likes to do,
[232.76 - 235.68] P:1865.53 E:0.120945 |  sent out on loan to Lorion in France.
[235.68 - 239.48] P:1923.49 E:0.141160 |  And here comes Clevely... You're winding me up, by the way, aren't you?
[239.48 - 240.92] P:1632.01 E:0.125007 |  No, no, awesome!
[240.92 - 243.08] P:1802.69 E:0.129984 |  Here comes Ashley Young of Manchester United.
[244.28 - 248.48] P:1797.40 E:0.128473 |  You know that I was pouring over the research before the game.
[250.52 - 252.12] P:1727.43 E:0.158237 |  If you're really interested, I'll carry on.
[252.12 - 252.88] P:1878.86 E:0.161343 |  No, you're right.
[252.88 - 253.76] P:1705.42 E:0.080611 |  OK, thank you.
[253.76 - 257.48] P:1728.10 E:0.128733 |  It's Arsene Bynfour, Arsenal over on the far side,
[257.48 - 259.84] P:1869.13 E:0.140454 |  and he's lost the ball easily, cheaply really.
[259.84 - 263.24] P:1736.65 E:0.126263 |  Nani for Manchester United, Wellbeck, difficult control.
[263.24 - 265.40] P:1898.46 E:0.114645 |  Try to find Ashley Young on his left-hand side.
[265.40 - 268.00] P:1933.19 E:0.137086 |  Juru at full stretch, clears, into wall-cop,
[268.00 - 270.52] P:1921.61 E:0.134494 |  first time you mention him and he doesn't hold on to the ball.
[270.52 - 271.84] P:1859.98 E:0.109414 |  Wellbeck to Young.
[271.84 - 274.44] P:1873.25 E:0.133695 |  Rooney in good position down the left-hand side.
[274.44 - 277.64] P:1853.86 E:0.130639 |  Rooney cuts in and then tries a shot at the goalkeeper,
[277.64 - 280.52] P:1940.21 E:0.142545 |  and Shezny holds onto it and throws it out to Riziski.
[280.52 - 281.56] P:1853.11 E:0.146519 |  Yeah, well played, Ashley Young.
[281.56 - 285.20] P:1707.16 E:0.134143 |  He played the ball into Rooney on the left-hand side, then ran behind him,
[285.20 - 286.92] P:1761.94 E:0.128383 |  so he distracted the right back a little bit.
[286.92 - 289.12] P:1712.89 E:0.129009 |  Rooney comes inside and hits a decent shot,
[289.12 - 290.52] P:1718.25 E:0.101945 |  but comfortable save, certainly.
[290.52 - 292.36] P:1699.44 E:0.136040 |  Manchester United nil, Arsenal nil.
[292.36 - 295.32] P:1583.61 E:0.120995 |  Howard Webb's given Arsenal the free kick in the centre-circle.
[295.32 - 297.84] P:1595.73 E:0.111317 |  With great relief, they're about to take it.
[297.84 - 301.64] P:1640.99 E:0.115684 |  Riziski now, across the field to Traorey.
[301.64 - 304.16] P:1678.37 E:0.114172 |  The left back, now Riziski.
[304.16 - 305.60] P:1695.53 E:0.139452 |  It's very slow from Arsenal.
[305.60 - 308.40] P:1627.24 E:0.115190 |  Now Kokoland, just inside the centre-circle.
[308.40 - 310.32] P:1702.88 E:0.123755 |  Arsenal just trying to get a foothold here,
[310.32 - 311.52] P:1830.78 E:0.124633 |  just trying to get some possession.
[311.52 - 314.48] P:1658.85 E:0.124620 |  Juru, good ball, Kokoland slips it away from Anderson.
[314.48 - 315.96] P:1705.98 E:0.132245 |  Now Riziski to Van Persie.
[316.00 - 317.48] P:1698.71 E:0.109206 |  This is good play from Arsenal.
[317.48 - 320.04] P:1734.67 E:0.128795 |  It's Kokoland looking for the best option, calling for it.
[320.04 - 321.56] P:1854.66 E:0.112490 |  Arshavin over on the left.
[321.56 - 323.32] P:1735.40 E:0.123427 |  Van Persie in the penalty area.
[323.32 - 325.96] P:1784.51 E:0.122172 |  Here comes Arshavin, taking on Chris Smalling.
[325.96 - 327.00] P:1790.70 E:0.158325 |  Traorey's made a run.
[327.00 - 328.00] P:1922.26 E:0.110679 |  Arshavin's layoff.
[328.00 - 330.36] P:1809.89 E:0.130291 |  Traorey cuts it back, header away by Jones.
[330.36 - 331.72] P:1779.21 E:0.118402 |  Still not completely clear.
[331.72 - 333.12] P:1904.60 E:0.105752 |  Jenkinson tries a shot,
[333.12 - 335.56] P:1797.52 E:0.121642 |  charged down by Ever of Manchester United.
[335.56 - 338.12] P:1822.73 E:0.143871 |  Ball on the edge of the United area, and now Young clears,
[338.12 - 340.60] P:1867.14 E:0.110149 |  and that's the first real sign we've seen from Arsenal.
[340.60 - 342.40] P:1883.24 E:0.144399 |  Yeah, Arshavin did really well, actually.
[342.40 - 344.08] P:1792.84 E:0.141343 |  Just waited for Traorey to over that
[344.08 - 346.96] P:1774.45 E:0.121988 |  and played him a perfect ball where he didn't have to break his stride
[346.96 - 348.92] P:1699.86 E:0.121085 |  and just cross it into the United box.
[348.92 - 352.76] P:1780.08 E:0.138014 |  A problem for Arsenal, not enough whatever colour shirts they've got on in there.
[352.76 - 353.80] P:1559.38 E:0.118697 |  What are they, by the way?
[353.80 - 355.12] P:1694.78 E:0.104768 |  Well, I thought...
[355.12 - 356.68] P:1690.48 E:0.140128 |  sort of Navy and Turquoise.
[356.68 - 359.36] P:1619.83 E:0.133104 |  I thought when we were here on Monday night for the Spurs game,
[359.36 - 363.00] P:1597.65 E:0.116405 |  there was a big example of the contrast between the way United play
[363.00 - 363.96] P:1441.84 E:0.134234 |  and the way Arsenal play.
[363.96 - 366.72] P:1599.76 E:0.136088 |  When Wellbeck scored, I noticed when the cross came over,
[366.72 - 369.12] P:1710.30 E:0.136443 |  there were four United players in the penalty area.
[369.12 - 372.20] P:1835.02 E:0.128470 |  And that's always been Arsenal's problem, but now it's Arshavin.
[372.24 - 373.84] P:1725.22 E:0.125940 |  Looking to try and find van Persie.
[373.84 - 376.92] P:1842.34 E:0.124131 |  The door was closed by Evans, bit brighter from Arsenal,
[376.92 - 378.36] P:1821.07 E:0.132509 |  but it's Nil Nil at Old Trafford,
[378.36 - 381.20] P:1785.13 E:0.119265 |  and now Ashley Young taking on the full-back Jenkinson.
[381.20 - 383.68] P:1783.83 E:0.104414 |  Jenkinson just holding him, tight to the line.
[383.68 - 384.80] P:1786.28 E:0.132312 |  Young will have to get rid of this.
[384.80 - 387.00] P:1888.18 E:0.114003 |  Young now sweeps it across to the far side,
[387.00 - 391.96] P:1724.87 E:0.114659 |  smalling just inside the Arsenal half, into Nani, back again to smalling.
[391.96 - 394.72] P:1829.64 E:0.129102 |  United, Nil, Arsenal, Nils, smalling to Nani.
[394.72 - 396.68] P:1698.66 E:0.123141 |  Traorey didn't cut it out.
[396.68 - 397.88] P:1674.95 E:0.147791 |  Nani looking to work it in,
[397.88 - 399.80] P:1908.48 E:0.133935 |  and there are three United players in the penalty area,
[399.80 - 402.56] P:1895.68 E:0.126628 |  and it goes, Rooney jumps early but couldn't jump high enough,
[402.56 - 404.40] P:1900.84 E:0.125871 |  and it's gone behind for Golcic.
[404.40 - 407.72] P:1816.84 E:0.122054 |  Well, already, United are starting to test Arsenal at the back.
[407.72 - 410.12] P:1640.89 E:0.120203 |  Young was trying to run at Jenkinson before down,
[410.12 - 411.68] P:1697.34 E:0.086816 |  Manchester United is left.
[411.68 - 413.32] P:1667.19 E:0.145734 |  Nani there just cut inside Traorey,
[413.32 - 416.04] P:1747.20 E:0.125108 |  and he's clipped a ball with the outside of his right foot,
[416.04 - 417.84] P:1744.08 E:0.120117 |  which wasn't a bad cross at all.
[417.84 - 419.80] P:1798.98 E:0.109095 |  It really just couldn't quite reach.
[419.80 - 421.04] P:1746.98 E:0.159799 |  Threatening Sky ahead,
[421.04 - 422.96] P:1646.70 E:0.123641 |  it's going to rain in the next five minutes, I think.
[422.96 - 425.68] P:1807.03 E:0.134702 |  It's Nil Nil here, and it's Ashley Young of Manchester United.
[425.68 - 426.64] P:1844.08 E:0.173217 |  Ball play through!
[426.64 - 429.36] P:1870.86 E:0.141876 |  Wellbeck's onside, Wellbeck into the penalty area,
[429.40 - 431.80] P:1814.00 E:0.136489 |  and he shoots wide, should have done better.
[431.80 - 433.60] P:1924.83 E:0.127239 |  Kishelny tried to close him down.
[433.60 - 435.64] P:1889.31 E:0.129788 |  It's a fantastic ball to find Wellbeck,
[435.64 - 437.48] P:1867.69 E:0.134134 |  and he should have really had that one on target.
[437.48 - 438.36] P:1871.44 E:0.107382 |  Arsenal survived.
[438.36 - 441.16] P:1757.86 E:0.132448 |  Yeah, he didn't really take the ball well, Mike, when it was passed to him.
[441.16 - 444.16] P:1793.71 E:0.130035 |  He almost lost himself a half second, by the way.
[444.16 - 445.76] P:1606.60 E:0.145158 |  He didn't shape his body to take the ball.
[445.76 - 446.88] P:1769.56 E:0.119080 |  The other thing as well is,
[446.88 - 449.16] P:1674.79 E:0.139827 |  once he got in the penalty area, he could have had another touch,
[449.16 - 451.96] P:1747.42 E:0.127113 |  because Kishelny would have had to bring him down and foul him.
[451.96 - 454.60] P:1696.27 E:0.114473 |  That could have been penalty and red, of course.
[454.60 - 457.36] P:1759.13 E:0.138436 |  Has to make the most of his opportunities.
[457.36 - 460.92] P:1650.39 E:0.129536 |  Wellbeck, when he starts with people like Burbotoff and Hernandez,
[460.92 - 463.28] P:1801.75 E:0.108306 |  waiting to come on from the bench.
[463.28 - 464.84] P:1734.46 E:0.140595 |  Evans now looking to return it.
[464.84 - 468.48] P:1691.52 E:0.110466 |  No, he doesn't. He clips the ball over his head, tries to find Wellbeck.
[468.48 - 472.24] P:1674.41 E:0.112278 |  And Arsenal now trying to get hold of it once more in midfield.
[472.24 - 474.76] P:1831.87 E:0.130024 |  Ramsey, fouled by Ramsey on Wellbeck,
[474.76 - 477.04] P:1838.90 E:0.123812 |  given by Howard Webb, three-kick to Manchester United.
[477.04 - 479.48] P:1831.40 E:0.121143 |  Sorry, you'd also be extremely worried
[479.48 - 481.20] P:1708.25 E:0.115225 |  how there was that massive gap,
[481.20 - 484.16] P:1662.11 E:0.112578 |  the sort of right-sided Arsenal centre-back,
[484.16 - 485.32] P:1588.74 E:0.148347 |  but it was nowhere near.
[485.32 - 487.68] P:1571.56 E:0.116663 |  It wasn't as though Wellbeck had to make a clever run.
[487.68 - 489.28] P:1742.53 E:0.141550 |  Manchester United, Nill, Arsenal, Nill.
[489.28 - 493.32] P:1817.58 E:0.132882 |  A much-changed Arsenal, five changes, it's Rooney on the ball now for Manchester United.
[493.32 - 494.48] P:1742.62 E:0.162375 |  And it goes to Young!
[494.48 - 498.12] P:1909.58 E:0.121550 |  Ashley Young and Manchester United just has to hold things up, didn't take it.
[498.12 - 500.52] P:2039.99 E:0.136961 |  In his stride, Jura was there with Kishelny.
[500.52 - 502.84] P:1810.00 E:0.140214 |  Arsenal clear, but I tell you what, they were split again, Mark.
[502.84 - 505.20] P:1961.56 E:0.104426 |  They were split again, and I think Ashley Young's
[505.20 - 507.16] P:1881.60 E:0.136749 |  seemed to get the ball stuck underneath his feet,
[507.16 - 509.00] P:1670.64 E:0.135574 |  otherwise he'd have gone past the Arsenal defender.
[509.00 - 512.12] P:1810.79 E:0.136008 |  Now, Walcott, Arshavin, but no return ball from Arshavin.
[512.16 - 514.84] P:1857.63 E:0.135958 |  They could really do with the performance from him today, Arsenal,
[514.84 - 517.04] P:1730.63 E:0.126749 |  as the ball is thrown out by Deherre,
[517.04 - 519.04] P:1822.14 E:0.117976 |  and it's Chris Smalling of Manchester United.
[519.04 - 522.00] P:1707.90 E:0.128455 |  They've been saying he could do with the performance from Arshavin for six months.
[522.00 - 525.44] P:1686.11 E:0.111440 |  Nani now, looking to clip it over the top towards Rooney,
[525.44 - 528.84] P:1750.17 E:0.132925 |  headed away by Kishelny, and now Treyori to Rizitsky,
[528.84 - 531.44] P:1843.92 E:0.134727 |  one of the experienced players in this Arsenal team today.
[531.44 - 534.40] P:1788.95 E:0.134315 |  Lovely running now from Treyori over on the Arsenal left,
[534.40 - 536.16] P:1814.30 E:0.114775 |  and Percy trying to stay onside.
[536.16 - 540.40] P:1843.44 E:0.125627 |  Treyori still needs support now, and in the end, van Persie slipped,
[540.40 - 541.96] P:1830.52 E:0.134458 |  as the ball was played through to him,
[542.00 - 544.64] P:1795.43 E:0.134365 |  and Manchester United looking to try and counterattack now,
[544.64 - 545.92] P:1658.94 E:0.148535 |  with Nani over on the right.
[545.92 - 548.80] P:1809.24 E:0.132630 |  Manchester United, 0, Arsenal 0, 8.5 minutes gone.
[548.80 - 550.68] P:1740.11 E:0.129172 |  The ball fired down the right-hand side.
[550.68 - 552.76] P:1742.50 E:0.120831 |  Welbet will get the ball by the corner flag.
[552.76 - 554.12] P:1736.11 E:0.129072 |  Rooney's in the penalty area.
[554.12 - 555.64] P:1853.70 E:0.123638 |  Ashley Young's trying to join him.
[555.64 - 558.40] P:1748.01 E:0.136103 |  The ball with Nani now, on the edge of the area, right edge.
[558.40 - 560.96] P:1674.33 E:0.109193 |  Little reverse ball doesn't work, and Arsenal defend,
[560.96 - 563.20] P:1757.67 E:0.132320 |  and Rizitsky plays it early to Walcott.
[563.20 - 564.64] P:1655.62 E:0.119329 |  Walcott up against Everett.
[564.64 - 566.20] P:1835.34 E:0.095851 |  Everett's just holding him.
[566.20 - 568.32] P:1738.18 E:0.134900 |  Walcott now, facing the right way.
[568.32 - 570.72] P:1839.40 E:0.149121 |  Everett easily takes it away from him.
[570.76 - 572.44] P:1849.20 E:0.148685 |  Easy steal for Everett.
[572.44 - 576.28] P:1855.45 E:0.126357 |  And Manchester United now playing it through midfield.
[576.28 - 577.32] P:1839.91 E:0.146194 |  Cleverly looking to release.
[577.32 - 579.04] P:1733.43 E:0.137479 |  Welbet, great running for a Welbet.
[579.04 - 582.12] P:1856.70 E:0.147004 |  Welbet turns in the penalty area, lays it to the right-hand side.
[582.12 - 583.44] P:1955.72 E:0.144594 |  Young against...
[584.88 - 585.92] P:1829.15 E:0.156410 |  ...Coccoland.
[585.92 - 588.04] P:1642.33 E:0.140399 |  There was an appeal rather halfheartedly, I think,
[588.04 - 591.04] P:1827.88 E:0.118872 |  from most of the crowd, but not the players, for a push there.
[591.04 - 592.40] P:1516.20 E:0.141600 |  Wasn't given by Howard Webby.
[592.40 - 593.36] P:1728.75 E:0.106229 |  Waves play on.
[593.36 - 595.12] P:1655.90 E:0.124696 |  Get marked to talk about that in a moment,
[595.12 - 597.64] P:1830.67 E:0.133953 |  as Ramsey's getting in trouble here against Rooney.
[597.68 - 601.32] P:1807.77 E:0.115953 |  But the ball falls kindly for goalkeeperais Gesney,
[601.32 - 603.00] P:1757.11 E:0.147643 |  who clears to Treori Farseye.
[603.00 - 603.72] P:1764.58 E:0.110143 |  What do you think of that?
[603.72 - 605.44] P:1882.32 E:0.151097 |  I thought Coplan was just stronger, Mike.
[605.44 - 607.80] P:1816.19 E:0.135010 |  I thought his desire to get the ball was better than that
[607.80 - 609.20] P:1852.77 E:0.130066 |  of the youngs, in all honesty.
[611.08 - 613.20] P:1675.46 E:0.141373 |  Not only do we have the threat of rain,
[613.20 - 615.80] P:1630.13 E:0.125520 |  I think we've got the threat of a Manchester United goal here.
[615.80 - 617.80] P:1722.63 E:0.136331 |  What, a threat to another lanche at the moment.
[618.36 - 622.08] P:1718.57 E:0.143988 |  But it's still 0-0, and we've played nearly 10 minutes of the first half.
[622.08 - 625.72] P:1699.19 E:0.128819 |  On a day when Manchester City have beaten Spurs 5-1 in London
[625.72 - 628.80] P:1612.74 E:0.119216 |  with four goals from Giacomo and the other one from Aguero.
[628.80 - 630.32] P:1798.33 E:0.113023 |  Now, Ashley Young forward.
[630.32 - 633.72] P:1827.14 E:0.148350 |  A busy day for Kishelny up against Rune, fouled by Rune.
[633.72 - 635.20] P:1854.26 E:0.137403 |  I don't think he touched him.
[635.20 - 637.76] P:1757.67 E:0.123312 |  I really seriously didn't think he touched him.
[637.76 - 641.16] P:1765.01 E:0.136495 |  Howard Rebb obviously got a much better view than those in his ten yards away,
[641.16 - 644.16] P:1790.84 E:0.105781 |  there must have been some contact, but I never saw that.
[644.16 - 647.32] P:1812.30 E:0.142195 |  They're being overworked here as Ramsey's fouled by Cleverly.
[647.32 - 650.08] P:1768.43 E:0.093361 |  I don't know where he did that, really.
[650.08 - 653.48] P:1764.48 E:0.126105 |  Anyway, free kick is given to Arsenal just inside the Manchester United half.
[653.52 - 656.40] P:1598.15 E:0.109155 |  It just takes a bit of the pressure away from Arsenal.
[656.40 - 660.16] P:1643.80 E:0.119715 |  And Ramsey, who's really had to step forward into this Arsenal team
[660.16 - 664.16] P:1675.01 E:0.117569 |  now in the absence of Wilshire and Song and, of course, Fabricas and Nazary.
[664.16 - 668.72] P:1611.67 E:0.115685 |  And Kokoland now finds Troy Ori over on the Arsenal left-hand side.
[668.72 - 672.20] P:1625.02 E:0.110947 |  Back again to Kokoland. It's a little bit slow from Arsenal.
[672.20 - 675.84] P:1785.47 E:0.132282 |  Now, Juru, the Swiss international, 15 yards inside the United half,
[675.84 - 677.20] P:1728.04 E:0.117755 |  flips the ball into Van Persie.
[677.20 - 678.24] P:1699.98 E:0.135408 |  Van Persie's headed down.
[678.24 - 679.44] P:1842.36 E:0.136537 |  Rzitzki onto Wolcott.
[679.44 - 680.88] P:1701.87 E:0.130094 |  Wolcott inside the penalty area.
[680.88 - 682.36] P:1863.42 E:0.127875 |  Now, Van Persie takes over.
[682.36 - 685.52] P:1865.95 E:0.128016 |  Van Persie trying to get some space here on the edge of the penalty area.
[685.52 - 688.32] P:1764.72 E:0.126145 |  It'll drop to Rzitzki, and now Wolcott wants more.
[688.32 - 690.88] P:1736.57 E:0.102080 |  But the initial move broke down.
[690.88 - 694.00] P:1761.27 E:0.126453 |  Wolcott again, took it early and fires it easily wide.
[694.00 - 696.96] P:1858.67 E:0.127928 |  It was just a chance there for Arsenal, but it just didn't run for them.
[696.96 - 698.20] P:1932.40 E:0.121382 |  Yeah, this was a split second.
[698.20 - 701.56] P:1598.64 E:0.126996 |  Look, that numbers in a little bit of space in Manchester United's penalty area,
[701.56 - 703.16] P:1432.95 E:0.100526 |  but it pitted out.
[705.00 - 708.80] P:1668.00 E:0.115154 |  De Haer, who had a couple of dodgy moments in the second half,
[708.80 - 710.76] P:1636.35 E:0.118968 |  yet to be tested in this game.
[710.80 - 711.76] P:1458.96 E:0.152185 |  11 minutes gone.
[711.76 - 714.44] P:1846.86 E:0.123367 |  Manchester United nil, Arsenal nil.
[714.44 - 716.76] P:1679.16 E:0.146359 |  Arsenal's only win in recent times in the Premier League.
[716.76 - 720.76] P:1679.48 E:0.131326 |  Was that one nil against United at the end of last season with Ramsey's goal?
[720.76 - 722.32] P:1805.40 E:0.112854 |  Rooney now to Wellbeck.
[722.32 - 724.48] P:1834.91 E:0.116454 |  Wellbeck surrounded by Arsenal players.
[724.48 - 726.00] P:1866.10 E:0.148187 |  Wellbeck too strong for Rzitzki.
[726.00 - 728.92] P:1775.77 E:0.129613 |  It was a very poor attempt by Rzitzki to win the ball.
[728.92 - 731.48] P:1841.47 E:0.116418 |  Clips in by Nani. Wellbeck with a flicked header.
[731.48 - 733.68] P:1770.29 E:0.150317 |  And that's going to be a corner. No, goal kick.
[733.68 - 735.52] P:1814.25 E:0.124563 |  I think it should have been a corner.
[735.52 - 738.44] P:1700.24 E:0.127816 |  I thought certainly Wellbeck just got in front of the defender.
[738.44 - 740.44] P:1541.37 E:0.116734 |  It looked like the defender might have had the last touch.
[740.48 - 742.88] P:1711.85 E:0.142272 |  I'll tell you what, we've got Terry Neil sitting down here, of course,
[742.88 - 746.88] P:1809.42 E:0.126406 |  who was a former Arsenal defender and Arsenal manager with Don Howe.
[747.72 - 750.20] P:1705.48 E:0.145581 |  And he'd have been watching on.
[750.20 - 756.16] P:1698.64 E:0.139754 |  And I mean, that challenge from Rzitzki was so hard-hearted, Mark, wasn't it?
[756.16 - 757.24] P:1711.61 E:0.117670 |  Powered up.
[757.24 - 758.08] P:1682.82 E:0.175819 |  It really was.
[758.08 - 761.48] P:1520.19 E:0.138799 |  And that really wasn't the Arsenal way, of course, under Terry Neil.
[761.48 - 763.48] P:1615.73 E:0.116401 |  And then George Graham in particular.
[763.48 - 764.96] P:1612.22 E:0.143643 |  Mike, Vieram Petty.
[764.96 - 765.96] P:1592.53 E:0.097426 |  Yeah.
[765.96 - 768.60] P:1680.02 E:0.124394 |  He obviously didn't want to get his boots dirty, did he?
[768.60 - 769.80] P:1742.39 E:0.136789 |  Throw into Arsenal.
[770.48 - 774.80] P:1699.39 E:0.133332 |  Jenkinson, who's really having to grow up quickly in the Premier League.
[774.80 - 776.68] P:1760.71 E:0.123474 |  Summer signing from Charlton.
[776.68 - 777.88] P:1683.40 E:0.126791 |  Jenkinson to take it.
[779.12 - 780.20] P:1548.78 E:0.147285 |  Not much on for him.
[780.20 - 781.80] P:1422.31 E:0.122929 |  Howard Wood wants him to get on with it.
[781.80 - 784.40] P:1657.53 E:0.125281 |  Throws the ball in towards his captain, Van Persie.
[784.40 - 787.52] P:1682.66 E:0.124209 |  Evera heads it out for another throw into Arsenal.
[787.52 - 789.36] P:1655.93 E:0.130841 |  Manchester United, Neil. Arsenal, Neil.
[789.36 - 790.20] P:1580.24 E:0.108740 |  12 minutes gone.
[790.20 - 793.36] P:1537.76 E:0.136352 |  Van Persie's jumped under every high ball so far.
[793.36 - 795.96] P:1647.53 E:0.111053 |  And my count is four at the moment.
[795.96 - 797.80] P:1678.22 E:0.150831 |  Jenkinson into Van Persie once more.
[797.80 - 799.88] P:1810.54 E:0.107732 |  This time Evans takes it on the chest.
[799.92 - 802.28] P:1807.02 E:0.121985 |  Young, very tight for United near side.
[802.28 - 803.92] P:1853.72 E:0.129489 |  Wellbeck onto Ashley Young.
[803.92 - 805.44] P:1845.64 E:0.130911 |  Good movement from Ashley Young.
[805.44 - 806.96] P:1767.60 E:0.126654 |  Onto Wellbeck and now Rooney.
[806.96 - 807.96] P:1709.66 E:0.116807 |  Back again to Young.
[807.96 - 810.60] P:1844.79 E:0.133325 |  And back again to Young once more from Wayne Rooney.
[810.60 - 812.56] P:1773.30 E:0.138008 |  Now they need a bit of width over on the far side.
[812.56 - 814.24] P:1784.00 E:0.118814 |  Smallings there, United right.
[814.24 - 815.96] P:1858.02 E:0.125065 |  Nani, back again to Smalling.
[815.96 - 817.44] P:1937.05 E:0.109130 |  Cleverley wants to join in.
[817.44 - 819.64] P:1604.30 E:0.135446 |  Everybody from United wanting the ball here.
[819.64 - 820.80] P:1639.29 E:0.134539 |  Down that right-hand side.
[820.80 - 823.04] P:1838.56 E:0.142879 |  And now in field to Cleverley on the edge of the area.
[823.04 - 825.64] P:1902.03 E:0.115983 |  Cleverley shot is blocked by Kishelmi.
[825.64 - 827.44] P:1806.25 E:0.146129 |  And now Razitzki gives the ball away
[827.44 - 829.68] P:1823.27 E:0.110233 |  and United are back in business once more.
[829.72 - 832.28] P:1865.09 E:0.118640 |  Nani, it really is a seed here.
[832.28 - 833.60] P:1904.29 E:0.130136 |  Ball in from Smalling.
[833.60 - 836.00] P:1969.12 E:0.132968 |  Clipped away once more by Kishelmi.
[836.00 - 837.24] P:1827.04 E:0.167302 |  And the throw to United.
[837.24 - 839.16] P:1901.58 E:0.127397 |  And you can sense from the crowd here
[839.16 - 842.84] P:1831.22 E:0.126286 |  that they feel the first goal is not too far away potentially.
[842.84 - 844.64] P:1501.60 E:0.119015 |  Throw to United, 0-0.
[844.64 - 846.00] P:1602.03 E:0.097735 |  Anderson.
[846.00 - 847.48] P:1664.39 E:0.133676 |  And now Nani.
[847.48 - 849.24] P:1643.61 E:0.155839 |  Nani turning with Arsenal defenders.
[849.24 - 851.56] P:1749.93 E:0.127381 |  And now Smalling gallops down the right-hand side
[851.56 - 853.08] P:1869.48 E:0.100377 |  but this time won't get it.
[853.08 - 854.00] P:1774.69 E:0.129762 |  And it's a goal kick.
[854.00 - 856.84] P:1782.43 E:0.114985 |  But I don't think Smalling spent any time in his own half
[856.84 - 858.96] P:1557.98 E:0.114806 |  in these opening 30 minutes or so.
[858.96 - 861.12] P:1343.87 E:0.118056 |  Very, very little and quite right.
[861.12 - 862.44] P:1797.77 E:0.133690 |  He's making our chev,
[862.44 - 866.16] P:1527.60 E:0.115720 |  and basically have to run backwards towards his own goal
[866.16 - 867.48] P:1627.05 E:0.149516 |  while we can reach a 40-minute.
[867.48 - 868.84] P:1748.83 E:0.121909 |  Think about Smalling, Mark.
[868.84 - 870.48] P:1537.88 E:0.136440 |  There's often a product from him as well,
[870.48 - 872.00] P:1508.85 E:0.127914 |  isn't there, down that right-hand side?
[872.00 - 874.68] P:1762.22 E:0.093372 |  He's galloping forward and often...
[874.68 - 877.04] P:1693.29 E:0.126720 |  There's something at the end of it too, as...
[877.04 - 878.52] P:1773.59 E:0.138330 |  Jones, we haven't mentioned him yet.
[878.52 - 880.80] P:1586.34 E:0.110522 |  Climes and Beats van Persie in the air.
[880.80 - 881.88] P:1607.45 E:0.141719 |  Now here goes Kokoland.
[881.88 - 883.08] P:1786.38 E:0.137502 |  Kokoland against Cleverley.
[883.08 - 885.40] P:1898.78 E:0.128819 |  Really good defending in midfield by Cleverley.
[885.40 - 887.44] P:1767.75 E:0.106641 |  Anderson gives it back to him once more.
[887.44 - 890.12] P:1650.57 E:0.118385 |  The movement is better from Manchester United.
[890.12 - 892.00] P:1626.52 E:0.101184 |  Anderson now onto Nani,
[892.00 - 894.04] P:1732.46 E:0.122531 |  who's deserted that right-hand position.
[894.04 - 895.84] P:1637.12 E:0.120717 |  But no Smalling is there.
[895.84 - 897.92] P:1719.61 E:0.111194 |  Jones now on the halfway line.
[897.92 - 900.32] P:1694.42 E:0.119246 |  Jones into Cleverley again.
[900.32 - 903.32] P:1692.44 E:0.140297 |  Manchester United nil, Arsenal nil, Rune rather.
[903.32 - 905.56] P:1776.50 E:0.096473 |  And now Patrice Evera.
[905.56 - 907.72] P:1759.54 E:0.109890 |  Evera for Anderson.
[908.92 - 909.92] P:1641.56 E:0.134574 |  Anderson...
[911.80 - 913.08] P:1726.60 E:0.161122 |  Going through the centre-circle.
[913.08 - 915.56] P:1649.36 E:0.112701 |  They're singing Patrick Vieira's name around the crowd,
[915.60 - 917.32] P:1617.40 E:0.089943 |  for some reason.
[917.32 - 920.28] P:1832.47 E:0.151105 |  Anyway, Arsenal thought they were going to go forward,
[920.28 - 922.08] P:1787.46 E:0.122278 |  but there's a foul over on the far side.
[922.08 - 923.88] P:1786.15 E:0.113835 |  Jones has got caught on the ankle.
[923.88 - 925.16] P:1661.29 E:0.117880 |  Jones has been caught,
[925.16 - 928.60] P:1664.14 E:0.098453 |  and Howard Webb just moves across to see...
[928.60 - 930.04] P:1544.16 E:0.109140 |  What is it, a back problem?
[930.04 - 931.72] P:1697.22 E:0.118269 |  No, it's his ankle, I think.
[931.72 - 933.48] P:1752.23 E:0.095435 |  And it's Arshavin.
[933.48 - 935.00] P:1775.82 E:0.098868 |  The court seems to catch him.
[935.00 - 938.36] P:1559.72 E:0.113505 |  We've got a note, have we, from our producer here, Kokoland?
[938.36 - 939.48] P:1673.62 E:0.146603 |  Got a yellow, Arshavin.
[939.48 - 941.40] P:1549.72 E:0.056139 |  Oh, right, OK.
[941.40 - 943.64] P:1668.90 E:0.146885 |  Kokoland was discovered by Gilles Grimondi.
[943.64 - 944.64] P:1766.87 E:0.074790 |  OK.
[944.72 - 947.52] P:1568.20 E:0.118503 |  And he's a fullback, really, I think, isn't he, by trade?
[948.96 - 950.56] P:1569.54 E:0.123720 |  And... Oh, red. Yeah.
[952.40 - 956.44] P:1829.70 E:0.125682 |  And he's playing because he has to in defensive midfield today,
[956.44 - 958.72] P:1703.40 E:0.118237 |  in the absence of people like Frimpong and Son.
[958.72 - 960.72] P:1710.47 E:0.139491 |  Jones is not moving too well at the moment.
[960.72 - 963.48] P:1713.64 E:0.123883 |  Got Rio Ferdinand on the bench today, by the way.
[963.48 - 965.40] P:1749.07 E:0.120495 |  He'll be fine, Jones. It's just a kick, mate.
[965.40 - 966.52] P:1522.06 E:0.141026 |  Shorthabbie Gopelo,
[966.52 - 968.52] P:1454.08 E:0.125298 |  although he's been named in the other 21s,
[968.52 - 970.80] P:1558.29 E:0.100104 |  I'm sure Gopelo will perhaps fancy him
[970.80 - 972.64] P:1625.89 E:0.134140 |  for the senior squad when he announces it tonight.
[972.64 - 974.24] P:1606.40 E:0.117279 |  You'll hear that on Five Live.
[974.32 - 976.04] P:1719.41 E:0.138908 |  Later this evening with John Murray.
[976.04 - 978.04] P:1907.60 E:0.115628 |  Throw to Manchester United.
[978.04 - 979.04] P:1860.50 E:0.099388 |  And, er...
[979.92 - 981.56] P:1634.90 E:0.157846 |  Franco Baldini's here today.
[981.56 - 985.44] P:1688.22 E:0.108586 |  Javier Gopelo's right-hand man for a few more months, at least.
[985.44 - 987.68] P:1666.44 E:0.128872 |  Manchester United over on the far side.
[987.68 - 990.60] P:1662.67 E:0.115237 |  Nil-nil with Arsenal, but Arsenal are holding on here.
[990.60 - 992.44] P:1724.01 E:0.099190 |  The ball is with Nani.
[992.44 - 996.16] P:1855.56 E:0.126114 |  Nani now with a chance to witness one in, and he's won a corner.
[996.16 - 998.28] P:1866.34 E:0.150200 |  15 minutes gone, corner to Manchester United,
[998.28 - 1000.00] P:1822.10 E:0.123527 |  far side the right, Anderson to take.
[1000.00 - 1002.48] P:1733.73 E:0.123741 |  Yeah, Gopelo was at Tottenham's game, wasn't he?
[1003.36 - 1006.24] P:1738.62 E:0.144579 |  And he was at the Villa Walls game, suffering yesterday,
[1006.24 - 1008.04] P:1807.65 E:0.105184 |  I think, at lunchtime, too.
[1008.04 - 1011.04] P:1777.31 E:0.128143 |  So, corner kick to United, Nil-nil, Anderson to take.
[1011.04 - 1012.56] P:1784.01 E:0.136436 |  It's small, he's gone to the near post,
[1012.56 - 1014.24] P:1892.13 E:0.126709 |  and that was a flat by Chezny.
[1014.24 - 1017.28] P:1700.25 E:0.111967 |  He could have held on to that one, but he decided to punch it.
[1017.28 - 1019.28] P:1631.82 E:0.147996 |  Pat Rice is urging everybody out of defence
[1019.28 - 1021.16] P:1671.72 E:0.137383 |  as he stands down there in the technical area.
[1021.16 - 1022.96] P:1882.63 E:0.134680 |  And the ball breaks for Arshavin now.
[1022.96 - 1025.16] P:1813.72 E:0.108371 |  Counterattack from Arsenal, perhaps.
[1025.16 - 1026.64] P:1930.97 E:0.142613 |  Now, can Arshavin do something here?
[1026.64 - 1029.04] P:1757.41 E:0.121595 |  Lays it to the left. Van Persie up against Jones.
[1029.04 - 1030.56] P:1781.28 E:0.124103 |  We'll try and turn the defender.
[1030.60 - 1033.80] P:1725.77 E:0.126614 |  Van Persie's ball in, runs right across the face of goal,
[1033.80 - 1035.40] P:1921.22 E:0.116327 |  and Ashley Young clears.
[1036.40 - 1038.88] P:1683.91 E:0.152191 |  Into Cokaland, inside the centre-circle.
[1038.88 - 1041.84] P:1787.05 E:0.115275 |  Now, Rzitzki, as Anderson tries to come back to hold him up.
[1041.84 - 1044.32] P:1806.61 E:0.118429 |  The ball is with Jenkinson, the fallback.
[1044.32 - 1048.24] P:1862.08 E:0.139652 |  Jenkinson slips as he tries to deliver, gets another chance.
[1048.24 - 1050.96] P:1854.76 E:0.126564 |  In it goes, header up by Jones, poor though.
[1050.96 - 1052.68] P:1760.95 E:0.111205 |  Straight to Ramsey of Arsenal.
[1052.68 - 1055.88] P:1736.37 E:0.116868 |  Ramsey's surrounded immediately by Cleverley and Anderson.
[1055.88 - 1058.60] P:1850.38 E:0.129849 |  Still Ramsey, Van Persie waiting in the area.
[1058.64 - 1060.92] P:1861.03 E:0.123606 |  It's taken too long. Now it goes to the left.
[1060.92 - 1062.36] P:1954.83 E:0.111585 |  Troyor is in space.
[1062.36 - 1065.12] P:1831.29 E:0.122191 |  Van Persie, Walcott and Arshavin in the penalty area.
[1065.12 - 1068.12] P:1770.25 E:0.124763 |  Ramsey again, trying to unlock this United defence.
[1068.12 - 1070.36] P:1882.17 E:0.134953 |  He sees Rzitzki on the right unmarked.
[1070.36 - 1072.36] P:1942.47 E:0.129912 |  Rzitzki shoots, wildly.
[1072.36 - 1073.72] P:1837.18 E:0.126612 |  Oh, got a deflection.
[1073.72 - 1074.76] P:1769.21 E:0.137799 |  Yeah, Kemal Fandersen.
[1074.76 - 1076.60] P:1715.78 E:0.105477 |  Yeah, Kemal Fandersen, didn't he?
[1076.60 - 1078.16] P:1634.75 E:0.154274 |  But before, when Ramsey was on the ball,
[1078.16 - 1081.68] P:1661.17 E:0.133964 |  there was absolutely no movement for him whatsoever.
[1081.68 - 1083.36] P:1702.39 E:0.135050 |  He had nowhere to go for ages.
[1083.36 - 1085.36] P:1708.72 E:0.145267 |  Good noise from the Arsenal fans in the meantime.
[1085.36 - 1087.56] P:1559.11 E:0.126799 |  They may not make any noise at the Emirates,
[1087.60 - 1090.44] P:1557.47 E:0.117718 |  but they are here at Old Trafford.
[1090.44 - 1092.44] P:1338.80 E:0.154836 |  Four or five thousand of them away to our right.
[1092.44 - 1096.36] P:1700.99 E:0.111993 |  It's a corner kick to Arsenal near side of the field.
[1096.36 - 1099.96] P:1662.15 E:0.121191 |  Nil-nil and Robin Van Persie to take the corner.
[1099.96 - 1101.96] P:1743.57 E:0.118748 |  Juru's gone into the penalty area.
[1101.96 - 1104.24] P:1593.54 E:0.129382 |  In goes the corner kick. The header doesn't come for it.
[1104.24 - 1107.36] P:1798.00 E:0.116287 |  And it's headed away by Kishelny off-balance behind.
[1108.60 - 1111.40] P:1722.69 E:0.115391 |  And it's a goal kick to Manchester United.
[1111.40 - 1112.56] P:1391.08 E:0.161324 |  The header didn't want to know that.
[1112.56 - 1114.64] P:1625.08 E:0.137229 |  Well, he came a little bit.
[1114.64 - 1116.64] P:1507.90 E:0.131685 |  He came a little bit, came about three or four yards out,
[1116.72 - 1118.72] P:1658.50 E:0.106444 |  and then decided he wasn't going to get there,
[1118.72 - 1120.72] P:1579.28 E:0.098847 |  which was the right decision in the end.
[1120.72 - 1122.72] P:1681.38 E:0.138331 |  That was probably the most alarming thing, wasn't it?
[1122.72 - 1125.72] P:1659.04 E:0.132515 |  The game against Spurs, where he just completely failed in the air.
[1125.72 - 1127.72] P:1678.66 E:0.124158 |  Yeah. And they nearly scored.
[1127.72 - 1128.72] P:1608.60 E:0.123506 |  They hit the post, didn't they?
[1128.72 - 1130.72] P:1711.15 E:0.097674 |  I think we know we talked about...
[1130.72 - 1132.72] P:1609.09 E:0.121941 |  I think about being a goalkeeper for Manchester United.
[1132.72 - 1134.72] P:1635.96 E:0.113646 |  You've got to have massive concentration, Mike.
[1134.72 - 1137.72] P:1616.95 E:0.130127 |  Long spells in a game where your team has a ball all the time
[1137.72 - 1139.72] P:1808.32 E:0.113241 |  and all of a sudden break away.
[1139.72 - 1141.72] P:1673.31 E:0.124202 |  That's when you have to make the save.
[1141.72 - 1143.72] P:1488.59 E:0.089094 |  I wonder if it was a little bit down to that.
[1143.72 - 1145.72] P:1714.97 E:0.114879 |  They lost the great Dutchman, Van Desaar.
[1145.80 - 1148.80] P:1708.68 E:0.096682 |  The Dutchman that's been catching my eye in goal this season,
[1148.80 - 1151.80] P:1541.72 E:0.121503 |  has been Swansea's goalkeeper, who really has started the season really well.
[1151.80 - 1154.80] P:1486.38 E:0.126423 |  Now, we've got an injury problem to Everett, I think.
[1154.80 - 1156.80] P:1509.33 E:0.146043 |  Cleverley as well. Oh, Cleverley too.
[1156.80 - 1160.80] P:1548.08 E:0.097442 |  Everett's just going to have a drink of water, and Cleverley's got a cut.
[1160.80 - 1161.80] P:1410.79 E:0.126481 |  And he's right eye.
[1161.80 - 1164.80] P:1695.71 E:0.137674 |  So if you're joining us, 19 minutes gone at Old Trafford.
[1166.80 - 1169.80] P:1636.51 E:0.158565 |  Tottenham won Manchester City 5, was the big result earlier.
[1169.80 - 1172.80] P:1649.20 E:0.127043 |  Newcastle beat Fulham by two goals to one.
[1172.88 - 1175.88] P:1617.87 E:0.116271 |  Nottingham Forest won West Ham 4 in the championship.
[1175.88 - 1178.88] P:1755.20 E:0.102264 |  Celtic had a 2-0 win against St. Mirren.
[1178.88 - 1180.88] P:1553.82 E:0.114775 |  Rangers are one up against Aberdeen.
[1180.88 - 1183.88] P:1578.86 E:0.121827 |  Watford are trailing 1-0 at home to Birmingham City.
[1183.88 - 1189.88] P:1570.66 E:0.109733 |  Those are the latest scores, as Cleverley has treatment for a problem with an eye.
[1189.88 - 1191.88] P:1522.94 E:0.126042 |  A little cut above it, I think.
[1191.88 - 1193.88] P:1732.69 E:0.140514 |  It's one of those nicks that actually bleeds profusely.
[1193.88 - 1195.88] P:1566.69 E:0.110552 |  I don't think it's going to be that bad.
[1195.88 - 1198.88] P:1561.42 E:0.096984 |  Got the stick on it. We've played 20 minutes. It's 0-0.
[1198.88 - 1200.88] P:1521.44 E:0.130366 |  It's been mainly Manchester United.
[1200.96 - 1203.96] P:1467.85 E:0.137403 |  Arsenal had a few moments on the break, and now here come United.
[1203.96 - 1206.96] P:1724.69 E:0.141625 |  Lovely running from Nani at Trioeri in the end.
[1206.96 - 1208.96] P:1759.82 E:0.130037 |  Covers Nani.
[1208.96 - 1211.96] P:1835.10 E:0.103390 |  I think they're appealing that Trioeri got his boot in there,
[1211.96 - 1213.96] P:1752.67 E:0.144100 |  and they're saying it was a back pass, but it wasn't.
[1213.96 - 1214.96] P:1441.70 E:0.115084 |  It went to the goalkeeper.
[1214.96 - 1216.96] P:1717.39 E:0.139565 |  So United at the moment down to 10 men.
[1216.96 - 1219.96] P:1703.61 E:0.134794 |  As Jenkinson burst down the right-hand side, near side.
[1219.96 - 1221.96] P:1652.59 E:0.118664 |  Walcott and Van Persie are waiting.
[1221.96 - 1223.96] P:1903.69 E:0.127812 |  Goes to Rositski. Cleverley's still off the field.
[1223.96 - 1226.96] P:1806.32 E:0.116291 |  Rositski took too long there against Patrice Evera.
[1226.96 - 1229.96] P:1760.01 E:0.143624 |  Rooney doesn't cut it out, and it's Ramsey now.
[1230.04 - 1232.04] P:1693.92 E:0.123506 |  Into feet for Walcott.
[1232.04 - 1234.04] P:1840.09 E:0.117474 |  Walcott taking on Johnny Evans.
[1234.04 - 1238.04] P:1819.69 E:0.121034 |  Walcott slid the ball across, and it was too far away
[1238.04 - 1241.04] P:1753.47 E:0.112991 |  from Robin Van Persie, and it goes behind the flag over
[1241.04 - 1243.04] P:1661.38 E:0.116531 |  on the far side for Manchester United's goal kick.
[1243.04 - 1245.04] P:1753.14 E:0.124288 |  Yeah, I think because of his pace there,
[1245.04 - 1248.04] P:1509.24 E:0.113641 |  when he broke, I don't think anyone, even Van Persie,
[1248.04 - 1251.04] P:1369.00 E:0.126231 |  could have realised or could have probably got in there on the end of it.
[1251.04 - 1253.04] P:1499.54 E:0.104276 |  Balance of power at the moment in the game?
[1253.04 - 1255.04] P:1709.51 E:0.076216 |  Still Manchester United.
[1255.04 - 1257.04] P:1702.97 E:0.105439 |  Sir Alex Ferguson probably disappointed.
[1257.04 - 1259.04] P:1622.69 E:0.136075 |  Well, that doesn't get it.
[1259.12 - 1262.12] P:1725.06 E:0.113711 |  Yeah, Fisch played two or three minutes with ten men.
[1264.12 - 1268.12] P:1535.11 E:0.119736 |  The Hares kick out of the area to Anderson, gets it back again,
[1268.12 - 1271.12] P:1564.48 E:0.122773 |  and then gives it accurately to Jones, who's recovered from that injury,
[1271.12 - 1273.12] P:1682.19 E:0.107138 |  down the right-hand side.
[1273.12 - 1276.12] P:1692.18 E:0.130966 |  And a feel for handball, it's given, I think, against Arshavin.
[1276.12 - 1278.12] P:1749.65 E:0.124590 |  Free kick to Manchester United.
[1278.12 - 1280.12] P:1737.54 E:0.119454 |  Say you what, he's a lucky boy.
[1280.12 - 1282.12] P:1629.81 E:0.086961 |  He's been booked, don't forget, hasn't he?
[1282.12 - 1284.12] P:1276.09 E:0.088840 |  Yes, he has.
[1284.12 - 1286.12] P:1540.97 E:0.099148 |  Early on, wasn't he?
[1286.12 - 1288.12] P:1591.91 E:0.135510 |  Yeah, he got booked for the clash with Jones.
[1288.20 - 1290.20] P:1799.64 E:0.108200 |  Right.
[1290.20 - 1293.20] P:1889.27 E:0.139389 |  Now, great running from Evera, near side, United's left,
[1293.20 - 1295.20] P:1775.28 E:0.140139 |  Arsenal galloping back, Evera in the penalty area,
[1295.20 - 1297.20] P:1696.69 E:0.138166 |  slides it in behind everybody.
[1297.20 - 1300.20] P:1837.90 E:0.127762 |  And Arsenal clear it was Treore, who booted it to this near side.
[1300.20 - 1303.20] P:1866.84 E:0.110231 |  Mike, that was very quick from Evera,
[1303.20 - 1305.20] P:1707.98 E:0.126036 |  and in the end it was played behind them all.
[1305.20 - 1308.20] P:1768.95 E:0.133781 |  You didn't see Jenkinson's position, he was actually in midfield.
[1308.20 - 1310.20] P:1625.05 E:0.116911 |  I don't know what happened to him. Throw in taken.
[1310.20 - 1312.20] P:1781.00 E:0.120751 |  Ashley Young of Manchester United, little back heel from Young,
[1312.20 - 1314.20] P:1748.19 E:0.116487 |  got the call from Evera.
[1314.20 - 1317.20] P:1864.70 E:0.128649 |  Evera's ball in towards Rooney, good header away from Kisheldi,
[1317.28 - 1319.28] P:1828.53 E:0.124766 |  drops to Anderson though.
[1319.28 - 1321.28] P:1873.86 E:0.136075 |  Anderson loops it in towards Welbeck, Jiru struggling.
[1321.28 - 1324.28] P:1898.32 E:0.159090 |  Welbeck's header and the goal for Manchester United.
[1324.28 - 1326.28] P:1829.06 E:0.153088 |  It's been coming, 21.5 minutes gone.
[1326.28 - 1329.28] P:1886.18 E:0.145861 |  Kisheldi really at fault, should have cut it out.
[1329.28 - 1332.28] P:1878.17 E:0.141491 |  Welbeck scores and it's Manchester United one,
[1332.28 - 1335.28] P:1802.71 E:0.150132 |  Arsenal nil and another goal for Danny Welbeck.
[1335.28 - 1338.28] P:1894.02 E:0.137100 |  Yeah, well played, Danny Welbeck, because he got himself in there
[1338.28 - 1341.28] P:1854.15 E:0.137601 |  and he just bustled the Arsenal centre-backs out
[1341.28 - 1344.28] P:1858.57 E:0.142111 |  in the way it was just like a flick past edge of the box
[1344.28 - 1346.28] P:1818.96 E:0.126378 |  from Anderson, it bounced.
[1346.36 - 1349.36] P:1800.85 E:0.144961 |  As it bounced, Welbeck just attacked it and the two central defenders,
[1349.36 - 1353.36] P:1835.44 E:0.137921 |  Jiru and Vimal and almost were statuettes, never moved.
[1353.36 - 1356.36] P:1861.13 E:0.130235 |  And Welbeck, he's pinched the goal there.
[1356.36 - 1361.36] P:1766.41 E:0.119362 |  I think I read a stat that Welbeck's last five goals have all been headers
[1361.36 - 1364.36] P:1578.98 E:0.140821 |  in the Premier League, well, there's another one.
[1364.36 - 1369.36] P:1718.87 E:0.151294 |  Manchester United one, Arsenal nil.
[1369.36 - 1373.36] P:1700.44 E:0.156072 |  It was always going to be a really, really big ask for this Arsenal team.
[1373.44 - 1376.44] P:1596.12 E:0.152972 |  Here today, it's even more so now.
[1376.44 - 1379.44] P:1546.04 E:0.126326 |  Once more, the defence has been found wanting.
[1379.44 - 1381.44] P:1695.28 E:0.134478 |  Danny Welbeck's taken full advantage,
[1381.44 - 1385.44] P:1677.37 E:0.123247 |  it's one nil at the halfway point at the first half, and here's Alan Green.
[1385.44 - 1388.44] P:1631.99 E:0.120214 |  Well, I blame Kisheldi and Jiru.
[1388.44 - 1392.44] P:1821.63 E:0.135413 |  Well, more Jiru, Jiru just sort of got himself out of the way.
[1392.44 - 1395.44] P:1786.54 E:0.126571 |  At least Kisheldi then came and tried to challenge.
[1395.44 - 1398.44] P:1639.42 E:0.134961 |  Absolutely awful defending by Arsenal.
[1399.44 - 1402.44] P:1646.62 E:0.133180 |  Goodness gracious. They don't need a sense of that, though.
[1403.44 - 1406.44] P:1689.97 E:0.146247 |  It is terrible. Here's Evera from Manchester United,
[1406.44 - 1408.44] P:1700.96 E:0.135395 |  rushing forward, Bolzer in the penalty area,
[1408.44 - 1412.44] P:1752.07 E:0.124366 |  tries to regain his footing, also tries to block Jenkins' authentic clearance.
[1412.44 - 1417.44] P:1768.05 E:0.130553 |  Won back by Nani, he finds Evera and Arsenal a goal down.
[1417.44 - 1420.44] P:1725.39 E:0.107174 |  And very easily this could get into a right.
[1420.44 - 1423.44] P:1622.91 E:0.115441 |  Well, Jenkins in that... The play so badly, Arsenal.
[1423.44 - 1427.44] P:1685.53 E:0.117538 |  The right back looks and is playing as a very inexperienced player.
[1427.44 - 1430.44] P:1685.40 E:0.134495 |  Rooney towards Smalling, into the penalty area.
[1430.52 - 1433.52] P:1729.02 E:0.143277 |  Smalling in his right foot shoots across the physical wide.
[1433.52 - 1436.52] P:1979.74 E:0.139032 |  Well, you're brilliant to get himself in there, an engineer half a yard.
[1436.52 - 1438.52] P:1973.13 E:0.133528 |  And you know what he's done Alan,
[1438.52 - 1442.52] P:1847.40 E:0.137001 |  a classic defender in the opposition penalty area, he's tried to hit it too hard.
[1443.52 - 1447.52] P:1741.29 E:0.123167 |  Too many poor performances by Arsenal players, particularly in defence.
[1447.52 - 1451.52] P:1766.99 E:0.134417 |  Too many passengers further upfield, like Rosinski or Chavin,
[1451.52 - 1453.52] P:1732.68 E:0.132760 |  and I've got to say Van Persing.
[1453.52 - 1455.52] P:1619.31 E:0.120689 |  Walk-ups done nothing.
[1455.52 - 1457.52] P:1692.01 E:0.089892 |  Goodness.
[1457.52 - 1459.52] P:1745.85 E:0.133351 |  They are a complete shambles.
[1460.52 - 1464.52] P:1746.10 E:0.121616 |  A-Shaven though, sprints forward, can't find walk-up with a pass.
[1464.52 - 1467.52] P:1625.72 E:0.126038 |  It's played back by Cleverney, Dehaa.
[1467.52 - 1470.52] P:1653.12 E:0.124587 |  His clearance, not collected properly by Welbeck.
[1470.52 - 1472.52] P:1594.49 E:0.126979 |  Here's Ramsey, one of the few Arsenal players
[1472.52 - 1475.52] P:1684.74 E:0.104669 |  who doesn't deserve criticism at the moment.
[1475.52 - 1478.52] P:1536.50 E:0.117301 |  24 minutes played here in five-live at Old Trafford.
[1478.52 - 1482.52] P:1748.19 E:0.120245 |  Manchester United won Arsenal nil after Manchester City won 5-1
[1482.52 - 1486.52] P:1517.86 E:0.082926 |  at Tottenham earlier today.
[1486.60 - 1488.60] P:1526.66 E:0.050761 |  Oh.
[1488.60 - 1491.60] P:1425.20 E:0.101021 |  They are breathtakingly poor Arsenal.
[1491.60 - 1493.60] P:1671.88 E:0.135550 |  Ramsey.
[1493.60 - 1495.60] P:1626.62 E:0.109105 |  They're ordinary.
[1495.60 - 1497.60] P:1616.34 E:0.145224 |  Traorie on the far side of the field.
[1497.60 - 1499.60] P:1563.12 E:0.112486 |  Traorie now approaching the United Penalty Air,
[1499.60 - 1502.60] P:1724.83 E:0.127480 |  tackled by Smalling and the ball breaks kindly for United,
[1502.60 - 1505.60] P:1676.86 E:0.116104 |  and then the clearance by Jones wasn't collected by Nani's.
[1505.60 - 1508.60] P:1528.39 E:0.122246 |  It should have been, and it's out for an Arsenal throw-in.
[1508.60 - 1511.60] P:1632.98 E:0.089794 |  I think it needed to be Nani's feet.
[1511.60 - 1514.60] P:1610.17 E:0.136170 |  There's no... Jones had time to bring the ball down
[1514.68 - 1516.68] P:1714.58 E:0.130837 |  and pass it on the carpet.
[1516.68 - 1520.68] P:1641.49 E:0.104051 |  Throw-in for Arsenal goes back to Ramsey.
[1520.68 - 1522.68] P:1492.03 E:0.117144 |  And Ramsey towards the near side,
[1522.68 - 1527.68] P:1578.55 E:0.104851 |  and Juru probably most culpable for Welbeck's goal.
[1527.68 - 1531.68] P:1564.12 E:0.107208 |  Now, Kokolant is actually young quite well for young Clea.
[1531.68 - 1534.68] P:1683.60 E:0.097592 |  Out of position as a holding midfielder.
[1534.68 - 1536.68] P:1571.19 E:0.120657 |  Yeah. Gets the ball again.
[1536.68 - 1539.68] P:1661.06 E:0.084796 |  Just left of the centre-circle Kokolant.
[1539.68 - 1541.68] P:1544.59 E:0.121661 |  Whereas the win, there isn't any at the moment.
[1541.76 - 1543.76] P:1813.89 E:0.108161 |  It's with Rzitzki.
[1543.76 - 1546.76] P:1676.46 E:0.128578 |  Rzitzki now to the right full-back Jankensen.
[1546.76 - 1548.76] P:1565.44 E:0.128716 |  Midway inside the United half.
[1548.76 - 1550.76] P:1821.13 E:0.109716 |  Rzitzki wants more.
[1550.76 - 1553.76] P:1715.39 E:0.118843 |  Walkock and Van Persie central.
[1553.76 - 1556.76] P:1627.46 E:0.135813 |  Rzitzki goes to Walkot, who'd come off the United defence.
[1556.76 - 1558.76] P:1724.36 E:0.144729 |  Finds our Chavitt back towards Walkot.
[1558.76 - 1560.76] P:1699.42 E:0.130619 |  Walkot bull down.
[1560.76 - 1562.76] P:1815.67 E:0.141228 |  Pernaldi kick, surely.
[1562.76 - 1564.76] P:1714.44 E:0.121615 |  Evans was at fault. No question.
[1566.76 - 1569.76] P:1767.94 E:0.133458 |  Yeah, actually, Young's just gone to berate the fourth official.
[1569.84 - 1571.84] P:1706.03 E:0.126668 |  Furnace to him.
[1571.84 - 1573.84] P:1813.09 E:0.125619 |  His flag went across his chest straight away.
[1573.84 - 1575.84] P:1718.18 E:0.130239 |  Straight away.
[1575.84 - 1577.84] P:1660.19 E:0.132127 |  Theo Walkot got half a yard on Johnny Evans.
[1577.84 - 1579.84] P:1777.87 E:0.110318 |  It just looked like Johnny Evans just clipped him
[1579.84 - 1581.84] P:1689.44 E:0.124568 |  as Walkot was about to run onto the ball.
[1581.84 - 1583.84] P:1726.12 E:0.138744 |  What would be interesting to see, Alan,
[1583.84 - 1586.84] P:1784.51 E:0.131795 |  whether he was actually going to get that ball before it went out?
[1586.84 - 1588.84] P:1843.60 E:0.139862 |  Well, he pulled the player back.
[1588.84 - 1590.84] P:1890.08 E:0.112018 |  It's a penalty kick, without question.
[1590.84 - 1593.84] P:1815.39 E:0.127551 |  And now, completely against the run of play,
[1593.84 - 1596.84] P:1720.41 E:0.125607 |  Arsenal have an opportunity to level the scoreline.
[1596.92 - 1598.92] P:1779.57 E:0.120118 |  It's the new captain, Van Persie.
[1599.92 - 1601.92] P:1738.31 E:0.104527 |  De Haer in goal.
[1601.92 - 1606.92] P:1878.95 E:0.139004 |  Right. Big moment for the new Manchester United goalkeeper.
[1606.92 - 1609.92] P:1887.92 E:0.135048 |  Even more important for the new Arsenal captain.
[1609.92 - 1612.92] P:1904.73 E:0.138941 |  His side trailing 1-0 here at Old Trafford.
[1612.92 - 1614.92] P:1882.63 E:0.126507 |  27 minutes play.
[1614.92 - 1617.92] P:1877.74 E:0.113380 |  Hard web, trying to make sure everybody's back where they are.
[1617.92 - 1618.92] P:1745.19 E:0.141916 |  Here comes Van Persie.
[1618.92 - 1620.92] P:1862.05 E:0.144832 |  Left for Chubb! Saved by De Haer.
[1620.92 - 1622.92] P:1820.12 E:0.149652 |  Terrible penalty.
[1622.92 - 1624.92] P:1850.20 E:0.145352 |  Yeah, very good save, though.
[1625.00 - 1628.00] P:1860.31 E:0.146914 |  What will that do to his conference, by the way?
[1629.00 - 1632.00] P:1784.20 E:0.150665 |  I just thought it was a weak penalty by Van Persie.
[1632.00 - 1634.00] P:1782.24 E:0.149029 |  Goalkeeper mix the choice of it.
[1634.00 - 1637.00] P:1829.50 E:0.143283 |  Which way to go, but you've got to hit it harder than that.
[1639.00 - 1641.00] P:1788.58 E:0.155185 |  De Haer save.
[1641.00 - 1644.00] P:1834.97 E:0.113463 |  Corner to Arsenal, played in from the left,
[1644.00 - 1647.00] P:1711.98 E:0.127375 |  and it skips over the head of Van Persie.
[1647.00 - 1649.00] P:1719.19 E:0.138474 |  That just sums up his first 27 minutes.
[1649.00 - 1652.00] P:1673.42 E:0.128251 |  Actually, the first 27 minutes for Arsenal.
[1652.08 - 1655.08] P:1687.43 E:0.138840 |  It remains Manchester United 1-0.
[1655.08 - 1657.08] P:1823.09 E:0.126200 |  Young, who was booked for descent
[1657.08 - 1660.08] P:1815.97 E:0.142939 |  after the penalty was awarded by the right,
[1660.08 - 1662.08] P:1796.55 E:0.144469 |  runs down the left side, he wins the throw in.
[1662.08 - 1664.08] P:1794.32 E:0.131710 |  Hustlin Jenkinson into a mistake.
[1664.08 - 1666.08] P:1821.96 E:0.102526 |  Young takes the throw to Anderson.
[1666.08 - 1668.08] P:1726.94 E:0.132615 |  Anderson strapped for the end of Old Trafford,
[1668.08 - 1670.08] P:1493.14 E:0.132873 |  running towards the penalty area,
[1670.08 - 1672.08] P:1664.85 E:0.113087 |  but his attempted pass doesn't find his target,
[1672.08 - 1674.08] P:1554.57 E:0.133620 |  and here's the errant Van Persie.
[1674.08 - 1676.08] P:1624.03 E:0.115835 |  With Ramsey to his left.
[1676.08 - 1678.08] P:1778.48 E:0.131260 |  Rzitzki available, too.
[1678.08 - 1680.08] P:1628.42 E:0.123111 |  Ramsey ignores Rzitzki,
[1680.16 - 1682.16] P:1680.41 E:0.134000 |  tried to find Walko,
[1682.16 - 1684.16] P:1678.54 E:0.127335 |  who had broken forward too quickly
[1684.16 - 1686.16] P:1754.22 E:0.138183 |  and was offside, three-kick to Manchester United.
[1686.16 - 1688.16] P:1695.52 E:0.147546 |  Listen to the cheering for the goalkeeper.
[1688.16 - 1690.16] P:1538.99 E:0.135637 |  It would be a big lift for him.
[1690.16 - 1693.16] P:1563.42 E:0.127104 |  I just think Van Persie made it quite easy.
[1696.16 - 1698.16] P:1586.76 E:0.110013 |  Cleverly back to Evans,
[1698.16 - 1700.16] P:1734.28 E:0.126897 |  who was certainly guilty of falling
[1700.16 - 1702.16] P:1717.34 E:0.113457 |  at the Arsenal player,
[1702.16 - 1704.16] P:1546.30 E:0.128605 |  leading to the penalty.
[1704.16 - 1706.16] P:1802.21 E:0.143338 |  Walko, not really down the left side, really.
[1706.16 - 1708.16] P:1722.64 E:0.112296 |  Hedge of the penalty across us, takes an affliction,
[1708.24 - 1710.24] P:1810.31 E:0.123804 |  headed away, purely by Arsenal.
[1710.24 - 1712.24] P:1665.33 E:0.116163 |  Young collects it, yard outside the penalty.
[1712.24 - 1714.24] P:1785.56 E:0.128489 |  On the drive-thru, great shot, great goal!
[1716.24 - 1718.24] P:1795.84 E:0.145971 |  Wonderful strike by Ashley Young,
[1718.24 - 1720.24] P:1831.79 E:0.149321 |  Manchester United 2, Arsenal 0.
[1720.24 - 1722.24] P:1750.47 E:0.151382 |  Well, we had the perfect view of that, didn't we?
[1722.24 - 1725.24] P:1849.62 E:0.141065 |  When he just moved the ball out of his feet,
[1725.24 - 1727.24] P:1841.57 E:0.142948 |  as he cut him from the left,
[1727.24 - 1730.24] P:1903.86 E:0.143700 |  some kind of 10 yards alongside the 18-yard box,
[1730.24 - 1732.24] P:1940.68 E:0.137413 |  and he just curled beautifully.
[1732.24 - 1734.24] P:1920.28 E:0.143069 |  You knew as soon as he left his foot,
[1734.24 - 1736.24] P:1817.71 E:0.143869 |  it was less than in the back of the net.
[1736.32 - 1738.32] P:1818.43 E:0.145829 |  Manchester United's goal!
[1738.32 - 1740.32] P:1744.46 E:0.148312 |  What's your money on? 4 goals, 5 goals?
[1740.32 - 1742.32] P:1815.04 E:0.153534 |  I think Manchester City's total of 5
[1742.32 - 1744.32] P:1773.24 E:0.149069 |  could easily be scored by Manchester United here.
[1744.32 - 1746.32] P:1794.50 E:0.130196 |  Well, as you said before,
[1746.32 - 1748.32] P:1834.59 E:0.126533 |  there's quite a few very poor performances.
[1748.32 - 1750.32] P:1665.24 E:0.139780 |  Take nothing away from Manchester United,
[1750.32 - 1752.32] P:1691.39 E:0.125446 |  but Arsenal are absolutely all over the place.
[1752.32 - 1754.32] P:1750.90 E:0.122927 |  Object.
[1754.32 - 1756.32] P:1780.30 E:0.145785 |  The right bat, he should be excused.
[1756.32 - 1758.32] P:1817.37 E:0.120395 |  He's young, very inexperienced,
[1758.32 - 1760.32] P:1857.99 E:0.152711 |  he's getting absolutely no help whatsoever
[1760.32 - 1762.32] P:1758.76 E:0.146008 |  from in front of him, Alan.
[1762.32 - 1764.32] P:1781.73 E:0.149359 |  He's got a lot of experience,
[1764.40 - 1766.40] P:1627.21 E:0.115856 |  but never from in front of him, Alan.
[1768.40 - 1770.40] P:1654.34 E:0.133149 |  I can't read Mike's writing, sorry.
[1770.40 - 1772.40] P:1725.34 E:0.126964 |  Premier League penalties this season?
[1772.40 - 1774.40] P:1854.39 E:0.120578 |  Seven missed out of 10.
[1774.40 - 1776.40] P:1689.10 E:0.127280 |  Seven missed out of 10.
[1776.40 - 1778.40] P:1629.85 E:0.147414 |  Unless it said 24 Anadan three times a day or something.
[1778.40 - 1780.40] P:1805.51 E:0.110597 |  Hahahaha!
[1780.40 - 1783.40] P:1651.62 E:0.106998 |  I think that was a prescriptive note from Michael.
[1783.40 - 1785.40] P:1630.51 E:0.093448 |  But definitely well meant.
[1788.40 - 1790.40] P:1683.80 E:0.115471 |  Here's Walcott for Arsenal.
[1790.40 - 1792.40] P:1527.23 E:0.104642 |  Arsenal could have been level at 1-1,
[1792.40 - 1793.92] P:1562.54 E:0.115491 |  one instead of two nil died.
[1794.92 - 1796.56] P:1690.38 E:0.138899 |  And we've only played 29 minutes.
[1797.00 - 1800.60] P:1633.63 E:0.136116 |  Jenkinson down the right side plays it off the shins of Evera.
[1801.20 - 1804.04] P:1522.84 E:0.143312 |  And it's out for an Arsenal throw in a couple of yards in the corner fly.
[1804.80 - 1807.04] P:1369.18 E:0.138467 |  In the Manchester United half Arsenal right.
[1807.84 - 1810.72] P:1524.61 E:0.134520 |  Jenkinson to take the throw in.
[1811.12 - 1813.92] P:1527.28 E:0.142576 |  We're bringing use of the goal at Hartz in a moment through
[1813.92 - 1817.36] P:1639.88 E:0.126229 |  Brand McLaughlin but we'll do it now since Arsenal
[1817.36 - 1818.64] P:1575.91 E:0.121218 |  wasted the throw at Brand McLaughlin.
[1818.76 - 1821.12] P:1919.35 E:0.146844 |  Why not Alan? Yes it's a goal for Hartz.
[1821.12 - 1823.32] P:1861.13 E:0.119594 |  Coming six minutes before half time.
[1823.68 - 1827.56] P:1746.51 E:0.133124 |  Ryan Stevenson the finishing of a terrific move that involved
[1827.56 - 1829.04] P:1925.21 E:0.133394 |  Jamie Hamill and Ian Black.
[1829.24 - 1832.60] P:1820.07 E:0.128880 |  There was Stevenson just six yards out to hammer the ball into the back
[1832.60 - 1834.44] P:1837.92 E:0.113034 |  and it Hartz deservedly in front.
[1834.44 - 1835.88] P:1813.75 E:0.126357 |  Hartz won. Hibs Nell.
[1836.08 - 1837.04] P:1642.14 E:0.122274 |  Thank you very much indeed.
[1837.92 - 1842.24] P:1688.67 E:0.134806 |  Well we could have a scenario tonight where two huge north London clubs
[1843.12 - 1847.04] P:1671.50 E:0.110126 |  you know have a point between them at the start of the season.
[1848.00 - 1850.72] P:1686.95 E:0.133315 |  Arsenal would be eight points behind Manchester United.
[1850.72 - 1852.96] P:1814.77 E:0.138983 |  Chaviches De Haer spills the save.
[1852.96 - 1854.24] P:1828.79 E:0.137603 |  Van Persie shoots again.
[1854.24 - 1857.52] P:1779.96 E:0.144940 |  It hits the Spanier goalkeeper and he's lucky to get away with it.
[1857.52 - 1859.52] P:1876.78 E:0.128680 |  Well they set the second one because they hit him a little bit
[1859.52 - 1863.04] P:1901.00 E:0.131880 |  but the first one he shilled it way out to the right hand side.
[1863.04 - 1866.40] P:1799.98 E:0.130205 |  And it just happened to be that Van Persie was there but he was really quick
[1867.04 - 1868.88] P:1889.22 E:0.145024 |  in terms of getting his position again.
[1868.88 - 1869.60] P:1860.49 E:0.112114 |  De Haer.
[1871.20 - 1873.52] P:1804.08 E:0.146268 |  So he's been quite busy actually.
[1874.32 - 1874.88] P:1442.47 E:0.146159 |  De Haer.
[1875.84 - 1877.44] P:1739.09 E:0.148231 |  Manchester United two.
[1877.44 - 1879.60] P:1577.79 E:0.122017 |  Arsenal Nell here on five live in the BBC.
[1879.60 - 1881.20] P:1574.04 E:0.121235 |  Coverage in the Barclays Premier League.
[1881.20 - 1882.88] P:1784.53 E:0.098785 |  Smalling to Cleverley.
[1882.88 - 1884.16] P:1771.29 E:0.135137 |  Good ball by Cleverley.
[1884.16 - 1885.60] P:1774.17 E:0.133437 |  Quickly played to Rooney.
[1885.60 - 1887.28] P:1644.53 E:0.145650 |  Nanny with a run forward.
[1887.28 - 1888.40] P:1798.32 E:0.127076 |  Rooney crosses deeper.
[1888.40 - 1891.44] P:1663.23 E:0.140007 |  Looking for Waelberk who heads it wide when he should have been on target.
[1891.44 - 1892.40] P:1999.32 E:0.132972 |  Yeah should have scored.
[1892.40 - 1893.44] P:1981.64 E:0.120762 |  Great ball.
[1893.44 - 1895.36] P:2007.63 E:0.141346 |  It was a royal of the Robes diving had it wasn't it?
[1895.36 - 1896.40] P:1794.79 E:0.120302 |  Bottom corner.
[1896.40 - 1897.76] P:1853.24 E:0.137101 |  Great ball by Rooney.
[1897.76 - 1899.52] P:1799.47 E:0.147339 |  Lovely ball as well played into him.
[1899.52 - 1900.64] P:1762.97 E:0.151248 |  He's hit it on the run early.
[1900.64 - 1904.08] P:1749.36 E:0.128182 |  Curling away from Chesney and Waelberk should actually have scored.
[1904.08 - 1904.80] P:1766.54 E:0.141888 |  Should be three now.
[1905.60 - 1906.48] P:1671.30 E:0.139911 |  Without question.
[1908.08 - 1910.40] P:1693.79 E:0.115346 |  So Hernandez is warming up.
[1911.36 - 1912.00] P:1622.01 E:0.139360 |  Would you be?
[1914.00 - 1914.72] P:1701.54 E:0.144439 |  Remember me.
[1917.12 - 1919.36] P:1522.14 E:0.135560 |  Look I know I think Waelberk's got great talent
[1920.00 - 1922.56] P:1670.77 E:0.109950 |  but he's not a patch on Hernandez for me.
[1922.56 - 1923.28] P:1858.42 E:0.125711 |  Not yet no.
[1924.80 - 1926.00] P:1818.89 E:0.126034 |  Should have scored there.
[1926.00 - 1930.40] P:1737.81 E:0.103698 |  Should have been his second goal after the first one was presented to him by
[1930.40 - 1933.36] P:1819.66 E:0.141727 |  Shambolic defending from Kishelny and Juru.
[1933.36 - 1934.88] P:1846.52 E:0.153927 |  Was it he lost the ball again?
[1934.88 - 1935.84] P:1575.59 E:0.117908 |  Well there's a surprise.
[1936.40 - 1937.84] P:1605.37 E:0.140406 |  Nanny in the far side of the field.
[1937.84 - 1939.20] P:1656.30 E:0.137341 |  Into Cleverine in the penalty.
[1939.20 - 1940.88] P:1629.08 E:0.119595 |  Pulls it back towards Rooney.
[1940.88 - 1945.28] P:1642.60 E:0.128770 |  Just knocked up into the air by Kishelny and is properly cleared by Ramsey.
[1946.00 - 1950.32] P:1667.44 E:0.132406 |  At least away from the immediate danger area and then Kokola hustling Anderson
[1950.32 - 1952.00] P:1773.24 E:0.134487 |  and Anderson fouls him.
[1952.00 - 1953.20] P:1843.62 E:0.111990 |  Freaking to after.
[1953.20 - 1959.92] P:1734.80 E:0.102247 |  Yeah I'm not sure who said it on a Wednesday night about pay for an over the cracks
[1959.92 - 1962.00] P:1608.68 E:0.127161 |  with Arsenal's result in Udine.
[1962.00 - 1963.12] P:1569.66 E:0.118012 |  I said it this afternoon.
[1963.44 - 1966.56] P:1670.12 E:0.122753 |  Somebody said it straight away on Wednesday night and it might have been Darren Fletcher.
[1966.56 - 1967.36] P:1392.15 E:0.138534 |  How right he was.
[1967.36 - 1972.24] P:1718.66 E:0.121915 |  I'm really surprised at how limp this display is from Arsenal.
[1972.24 - 1976.80] P:1784.77 E:0.133134 |  And of course Ramsey's just taking part in it now by over hitting a pass
[1976.80 - 1980.32] P:1723.71 E:0.128740 |  beyond Van Persie straight out of play for a throw and he put his head in his hands.
[1981.44 - 1983.36] P:1495.06 E:0.138162 |  Haven't seen a clue of Arsene Wenger for a while.
[1983.36 - 1984.64] P:1626.94 E:0.124432 |  We've lost to his head in his hands.
[1984.64 - 1985.28] P:1670.65 E:0.087127 |  Alan.
[1985.28 - 1985.92] P:1742.59 E:0.112561 |  Oh Shavin.
[1986.80 - 1987.52] P:1716.04 E:0.127454 |  And Persie.
[1988.40 - 1989.12] P:1830.27 E:0.126710 |  Razitzki.
[1989.12 - 1990.16] P:1646.85 E:0.135434 |  Where's the time?
[1990.16 - 1990.64] P:1654.25 E:0.170416 |  Juru.
[1990.64 - 1991.60] P:1811.55 E:0.115644 |  Juru.
[1991.60 - 1992.56] P:1730.49 E:0.100534 |  Object at best.
[1994.00 - 1996.24] P:1609.21 E:0.138504 |  It's nearly half your outfield players.
[1997.36 - 1998.00] P:1514.32 E:0.149184 |  Repeat though.
[1998.00 - 1999.84] P:1648.55 E:0.121069 |  They've nine players missing.
[1999.84 - 2000.96] P:1867.76 E:0.118440 |  Three of them suspended.
[2000.96 - 2003.44] P:1621.99 E:0.097862 |  All of them would have expected to start today.
[2003.44 - 2004.80] P:1852.54 E:0.108285 |  Stepping off so getting this team.
[2007.36 - 2009.84] P:1707.59 E:0.125759 |  Terry Neil might get in the team as he is now.
[2009.84 - 2011.28] P:1821.33 E:0.115066 |  He's only got one shoe.
[2011.28 - 2011.84] P:1426.45 E:0.120631 |  That's enough.
[2013.12 - 2015.68] P:1707.16 E:0.129350 |  Jenkinson with a throw in to Juru.
[2015.68 - 2016.64] P:1777.52 E:0.112451 |  Back to Jenkinson.
[2017.52 - 2018.64] P:1780.70 E:0.137090 |  And here's Kachelny.
[2019.44 - 2021.36] P:1530.86 E:0.144270 |  On to the far side and Treore.
[2021.36 - 2022.72] P:1492.59 E:0.121438 |  We're seeing Arsene Wenger now.
[2023.28 - 2027.12] P:1601.43 E:0.087940 |  Who's looking pained, let's say.
[2027.68 - 2032.80] P:1654.47 E:0.113070 |  Leaning back in these comfortable coaching seats at Old Trafford.
[2032.80 - 2034.88] P:1782.54 E:0.131375 |  Did he really say that the season starts on the tenth?
[2034.88 - 2035.68] P:1628.01 E:0.152746 |  Yes, he did.
[2036.64 - 2037.44] P:1610.59 E:0.127113 |  Home to Sunderland.
[2037.44 - 2038.96] P:1756.08 E:0.102672 |  It's not the shooting season, is it?
[2038.96 - 2040.72] P:1508.23 E:0.131355 |  Walcott on the far side of the field.
[2043.28 - 2044.80] P:1492.42 E:0.153000 |  As our engineer enjoyed that crack.
[2045.36 - 2047.52] P:1561.30 E:0.137115 |  12 minutes to go to half time at five live.
[2047.52 - 2049.84] P:1641.92 E:0.126123 |  Manchester United two are still 0.
[2050.48 - 2054.48] P:1450.36 E:0.076399 |  It could be far more than that.
[2055.20 - 2057.52] P:1444.66 E:0.140569 |  And I fear for Arsenal that it will be far more than that.
[2057.52 - 2060.00] P:1617.35 E:0.086635 |  Well, the thing is, Mike made the point before.
[2060.00 - 2060.72] P:1364.21 E:0.113708 |  Look at the bench.
[2061.28 - 2061.52] P:1574.16 E:0.067589 |  Yeah.
[2062.16 - 2063.92] P:1552.82 E:0.107468 |  And look at Arsenal's bench.
[2064.48 - 2065.12] P:1754.84 E:0.094496 |  That's what I mean.
[2065.12 - 2066.32] P:1756.70 E:0.115331 |  I meant Arsenal's bench.
[2066.32 - 2067.20] P:1557.30 E:0.132679 |  Oh, Arsenal's bench.
[2068.16 - 2071.60] P:1879.10 E:0.111274 |  Tell us what you know about Ajuku or Sunoo.
[2072.72 - 2073.68] P:1613.32 E:0.120755 |  Yeah, all right.
[2073.68 - 2076.24] P:1777.62 E:0.119828 |  Answers on a postage stamp, please.
[2077.20 - 2081.76] P:1712.81 E:0.139343 |  Young, caught there by a shavon, but Manchester United had the ball.
[2081.76 - 2083.76] P:1704.11 E:0.140550 |  Advantage play, Evans plays it upfield.
[2083.76 - 2085.60] P:1809.66 E:0.128640 |  Well, back to the hamstring.
[2085.60 - 2086.56] P:1809.46 E:0.123480 |  Done a hamstring.
[2087.20 - 2090.64] P:1856.38 E:0.122621 |  With that question, chasing after that ball, Hernandez,
[2091.36 - 2092.80] P:1452.71 E:0.151588 |  limber up even more, you're coming on.
[2092.80 - 2095.12] P:1881.53 E:0.114850 |  Yeah, that is absolutely amazing.
[2096.32 - 2097.36] P:1830.06 E:0.122347 |  After what?
[2097.36 - 2099.60] P:1901.76 E:0.121408 |  Almost 35 minutes.
[2099.60 - 2101.76] P:1693.59 E:0.138408 |  How someone's hamstring goes, I'll never know.
[2102.88 - 2103.84] P:1703.37 E:0.121968 |  I've done it myself.
[2105.12 - 2105.84] P:1476.35 E:0.156290 |  Why, Mark?
[2105.92 - 2106.56] P:1625.13 E:0.160893 |  I don't know.
[2106.56 - 2107.12] P:1654.82 E:0.112318 |  I really don't.
[2107.12 - 2107.76] P:1744.07 E:0.166591 |  He's warm.
[2107.76 - 2109.12] P:1742.92 E:0.111280 |  He's been running.
[2109.12 - 2110.40] P:1836.84 E:0.113491 |  He's been sprinting.
[2110.40 - 2112.56] P:1786.36 E:0.129081 |  I have absolutely no idea.
[2114.72 - 2116.08] P:1931.17 E:0.156378 |  While he's going off-dark,
[2116.08 - 2119.44] P:1887.93 E:0.140354 |  and Hernandez will replace him with that question.
[2120.16 - 2122.64] P:1922.95 E:0.145899 |  Wayne Rooney getting fresh instruction.
[2125.36 - 2128.16] P:1778.84 E:0.145297 |  That's really tough for Welbert, having started the season so well.
[2129.12 - 2130.72] P:1907.10 E:0.136915 |  Yeah, it's a real tough blow.
[2131.68 - 2132.32] P:1786.95 E:0.160995 |  Goal today.
[2133.28 - 2136.00] P:1778.85 E:0.139489 |  Manjeet Arson will be delighted, Hernandez is coming on.
[2136.00 - 2137.68] P:1552.57 E:0.155249 |  Oh, yeah, that'll make it a lot easier, won't it?
[2140.88 - 2145.68] P:1762.83 E:0.117890 |  So, Chikarito, I think that's what the name is on his back.
[2145.68 - 2147.20] P:1920.83 E:0.116740 |  Is there a 606 tonight?
[2148.00 - 2149.28] P:1917.26 E:0.124317 |  Yes, sure there is.
[2149.28 - 2153.84] P:1734.26 E:0.118018 |  We need a physio, don't we, to explain to us why that happens
[2154.56 - 2155.44] P:1737.34 E:0.141312 |  with your hamstring.
[2156.24 - 2159.44] P:1655.04 E:0.156345 |  Well, in the absence of physio, I'm sure Robbie Savage will be able to explain.
[2162.32 - 2167.20] P:1838.24 E:0.124046 |  Hernandez comes on, and unfortunately Welbert's gone off, of course.
[2173.36 - 2176.16] P:1649.94 E:0.111990 |  Well, we're out, just getting to know for the producer.
[2176.16 - 2179.44] P:1639.93 E:0.120585 |  Arson are actually at home to Swansea on the 10th, not Sunderland.
[2180.32 - 2186.24] P:1614.96 E:0.098151 |  So, if a quote from Arson was accurate, he's completely lost the plot.
[2187.36 - 2190.00] P:1608.68 E:0.123284 |  Oh dear, Sunderland at home to Chelsea that day.
[2190.00 - 2190.96] P:925.91 E:0.126532 |  Oh, I don't want to think about it.
[2190.96 - 2191.60] P:1330.00 E:0.081770 |  That's not fair.
[2192.72 - 2193.44] P:1687.56 E:0.116231 |  That's not fair.
[2195.52 - 2199.04] P:1631.45 E:0.129731 |  Still in the name of the opposition, but the quote was definitely
[2200.00 - 2201.68] P:1677.44 E:0.129275 |  Arsenal's season starts on the 10th.
[2202.72 - 2205.04] P:1685.07 E:0.130826 |  Well, the other problem is three days to go to the deadline.
[2205.04 - 2208.72] P:1625.53 E:0.127618 |  If they're on the end of a three or four here, who's going to come to them, play for them?
[2208.72 - 2212.32] P:1730.27 E:0.122310 |  Razitzki, Devan Persi, left of the United penalty area, back to
[2212.96 - 2215.60] P:1710.60 E:0.129355 |  Arshavin, Arshavin, pulls off Jones.
[2216.24 - 2220.00] P:1809.40 E:0.100930 |  Arshavin turns away again, back to Razitzki.
[2220.08 - 2224.56] P:1727.72 E:0.133142 |  Arshavin once more, 25 yards out, shot is high and very wide.
[2224.56 - 2227.12] P:1777.83 E:0.106323 |  And it's half down with Hartz from McLaughlin.
[2227.12 - 2231.04] P:1918.96 E:0.124847 |  Yeah, Hartz won, Haberni and Nill, Ryan Stevenson with his third goal of the season,
[2231.04 - 2235.68] P:1875.00 E:0.124252 |  giving Hartz a deserved lead, saying that Matt Thornhill missed a glorious opportunity
[2235.68 - 2237.84] P:1947.63 E:0.114841 |  to equalise for Ibs just before the break.
[2237.84 - 2240.24] P:1836.19 E:0.128372 |  Half time here at Tye Castle, Hartz won, Ibs Nell.
[2240.80 - 2245.20] P:1662.57 E:0.125498 |  Here we play nearly 37 minutes in the first half in the Barclays Premier League.
[2245.20 - 2248.08] P:1603.79 E:0.135999 |  Manchester United two, Arsenal Nill here on five line.
[2248.96 - 2252.40] P:1834.05 E:0.103724 |  Smalling to Jones, into cleverly.
[2254.24 - 2256.88] P:1648.82 E:0.109001 |  I haven't noticed any real alteration up front.
[2256.88 - 2258.88] P:1628.35 E:0.124888 |  I don't know what the instruction Rooney was receiving,
[2259.44 - 2265.92] P:1600.11 E:0.115732 |  but he's still roaming and always dangerous though he's lost the ball there to the youngster
[2265.92 - 2267.44] P:1660.35 E:0.143028 |  at Cockleland and then he wins it back, Rooney.
[2268.00 - 2272.80] P:1706.74 E:0.100820 |  Back it goes to Anderson, Rooney, Evera, the captain in the absence of
[2272.80 - 2275.12] P:1834.16 E:0.115314 |  Viddic and Evera moving in fear.
[2275.68 - 2280.24] P:1811.79 E:0.127041 |  Finding Nanny, Nanny is smalling, breaking forward on the right side and accurately,
[2280.24 - 2284.72] P:1792.54 E:0.124482 |  oh I thought he had played the pass accurately, but it was a little too strong and it's
[2284.72 - 2286.80] P:1646.49 E:0.113228 |  out ahead of smalling, out of play for Thoreau.
[2286.80 - 2289.36] P:1628.65 E:0.120532 |  Mind you, our shavin look bothered, like he was going to track him back.
[2290.00 - 2290.80] P:931.45 E:0.137603 |  Oh yeah, not.
[2290.80 - 2292.08] P:1653.22 E:0.098912 |  You can count on that, not.
[2293.28 - 2296.64] P:1560.51 E:0.124946 |  Throw into Arsenal who trailed two Nill at all, Trafford and it could be worse.
[2298.08 - 2301.44] P:1738.51 E:0.116185 |  They've got another throw in, Midway inside their own half.
[2301.84 - 2309.12] P:1740.25 E:0.093696 |  Traore operating it left back, gives us one of the absentees and my goodness, they're missing
[2309.12 - 2313.60] P:1646.65 E:0.110114 |  Vermeelen, who's probably one of the very few players who's actually impressed in the opening
[2313.60 - 2315.44] P:1615.35 E:0.088320 |  weeks of the season for Arsenal.
[2316.24 - 2321.12] P:1791.34 E:0.137888 |  Jones to Rooney for Manchester United, a young who was clattered into by Jury and
[2321.12 - 2324.48] P:1792.87 E:0.136032 |  fouled twice by Jury as if the first time wasn't enough.
[2324.48 - 2329.04] P:1692.38 E:0.122208 |  You made the point quite rightly, Alan, about Arsenal missing so many players, 11,
[2329.04 - 2333.68] P:1680.68 E:0.127336 |  but if Manchester United had 11 players missing, they'd still have a formidable team.
[2333.68 - 2339.12] P:1743.83 E:0.111457 |  That's the point that everyone's trying to make to Arsenal Venger about the depth of squad
[2339.12 - 2341.20] P:1629.22 E:0.133232 |  and the quality of those players in the squad.
[2342.72 - 2343.44] P:1864.20 E:0.153854 |  He's stubborn.
[2345.20 - 2346.96] P:1769.93 E:0.149009 |  Can't think of any other explanation.
[2346.96 - 2347.76] P:2068.26 E:0.106900 |  He's stubborn.
[2348.88 - 2353.12] P:1674.91 E:0.116872 |  Free kick to Manchester United, nearly 30 yards from goal.
[2354.08 - 2355.44] P:1262.10 E:0.132288 |  Nani might have a pop.
[2356.08 - 2357.04] P:1531.02 E:0.155350 |  Rooney's a round.
[2357.60 - 2358.64] P:1613.84 E:0.130987 |  Anderson's a round.
[2359.12 - 2362.64] P:1728.45 E:0.093361 |  Nani clearly suggesting it's his.
[2362.64 - 2364.24] P:1663.91 E:0.107387 |  Seven minutes to half time.
[2364.24 - 2365.84] P:1928.28 E:0.130024 |  2-0 to Manchester United.
[2366.48 - 2369.44] P:1528.97 E:0.122633 |  Hardwerbs got the wall back the full 10 yards.
[2370.24 - 2372.96] P:1750.28 E:0.134679 |  And Rooney comes forward, leaves it for Nani.
[2372.96 - 2375.44] P:1634.10 E:0.114499 |  Nani should try to put it in his dipping, but not quickly enough.
[2375.44 - 2376.40] P:1733.84 E:0.091655 |  And it's over the crossbar.
[2376.40 - 2378.16] P:1584.22 E:0.115340 |  Yeah, it was a little bit of a nothing, wasn't it?
[2378.16 - 2380.00] P:1703.09 E:0.109124 |  Is it with the in-step, trying to curl it?
[2380.00 - 2380.88] P:1530.47 E:0.085807 |  He's having a beat, she says.
[2380.88 - 2382.00] P:1605.10 E:0.158054 |  Still thinks he's Ronaldo.
[2383.20 - 2384.72] P:1572.10 E:0.135213 |  Goal at Watford for Steve May.
[2384.72 - 2386.40] P:1696.75 E:0.124113 |  Yes, it's an equaliser for Watford.
[2386.40 - 2388.16] P:1601.54 E:0.112226 |  Watford won, Birmingham City won.
[2388.16 - 2391.04] P:1794.55 E:0.122668 |  The scorer, Marvin Sodell, it's been coming, I can tell you.
[2391.04 - 2392.64] P:1590.96 E:0.123862 |  But a wonderful individual goal.
[2392.64 - 2396.72] P:1551.25 E:0.131987 |  He lashed it in from 20 yards into May's far left-hand corner.
[2396.72 - 2398.80] P:1408.66 E:0.112747 |  It's Watford won, Birmingham won.
[2398.80 - 2401.20] P:1642.53 E:0.137226 |  It's a blustery afternoon in Manchester.
[2401.76 - 2404.48] P:1699.17 E:0.126972 |  Quite chilly, threat of rain in the air.
[2404.48 - 2408.16] P:1776.17 E:0.126521 |  But nothing but delight from Manchester United fans so far in this
[2408.80 - 2411.76] P:1738.84 E:0.124841 |  usually titanic game against Arsenal.
[2411.76 - 2413.28] P:1759.61 E:0.132180 |  So far it's very straightforward.
[2413.28 - 2414.72] P:1783.63 E:0.147150 |  That looked like a foul and young.
[2415.68 - 2417.20] P:1703.63 E:0.143314 |  Now Jenkins has got a problem.
[2417.76 - 2419.44] P:1727.57 E:0.156286 |  He's going to be at least a yellow card.
[2420.08 - 2421.68] P:1602.02 E:0.144842 |  Young was approaching the penalty area.
[2421.68 - 2424.80] P:1656.95 E:0.142803 |  It's going to be a yellow and the ball was going away from the goal, surely.
[2425.36 - 2428.48] P:1584.96 E:0.126194 |  Well, you hope that Hardweb's only producing yellow and it is.
[2428.48 - 2429.44] P:1751.92 E:0.138733 |  Just a yellow card.
[2429.44 - 2430.64] P:1753.50 E:0.111643 |  I think that's the right decision.
[2430.64 - 2431.60] P:1541.35 E:0.131538 |  That's enough.
[2431.60 - 2434.56] P:1757.16 E:0.129957 |  Why they're arguing with the referee, Lord alone knows.
[2434.56 - 2435.68] P:1564.86 E:0.108311 |  What is their problem?
[2437.20 - 2437.84] P:1336.63 E:0.170823 |  Pull them down.
[2438.96 - 2444.32] P:1787.93 E:0.122697 |  And this free kick is in an area that surely Wayne Rooney will take charge here.
[2444.64 - 2446.00] P:1450.92 E:0.142779 |  And tell Nanny to back off.
[2446.88 - 2450.48] P:1705.80 E:0.131344 |  I just wonder it might be a little bit too near in terms of getting the ball up
[2450.48 - 2452.48] P:1683.76 E:0.129645 |  and over the wall and down in towards the goal.
[2453.28 - 2456.80] P:1539.19 E:0.117931 |  It's only a yard from the edge of the penalty area.
[2456.80 - 2458.24] P:1742.27 E:0.135079 |  Slightly to the left of the D.
[2459.28 - 2460.48] P:1774.24 E:0.127054 |  Aniston's across there.
[2460.48 - 2463.36] P:1732.11 E:0.132763 |  So too is Ashley Young and Nanny still in the vicinity.
[2463.92 - 2469.44] P:1736.60 E:0.108153 |  But Wayne Rooney sort of standing up, scouring the ball from others as if...
[2469.44 - 2470.24] P:1605.94 E:0.142157 |  Look, I've seen Anderson.
[2470.24 - 2470.88] P:1586.66 E:0.142403 |  I'm going to take this.
[2470.88 - 2472.08] P:1778.38 E:0.107886 |  See what Anderson's doing.
[2472.08 - 2472.48] P:1760.39 E:0.080754 |  Look.
[2473.44 - 2475.12] P:1670.19 E:0.134038 |  What is that in front of the goalkeeper?
[2475.12 - 2476.00] P:1726.97 E:0.120649 |  Oh, dear.
[2476.00 - 2476.88] P:1782.16 E:0.152814 |  So they can't see.
[2477.44 - 2478.08] P:1868.66 E:0.114160 |  Do you see it?
[2478.08 - 2478.88] P:1649.44 E:0.119391 |  Yeah, I do see it.
[2480.56 - 2483.84] P:1712.67 E:0.132088 |  Now, if the ball goes straight into the net, why is he not in an offside position?
[2483.84 - 2486.00] P:1610.78 E:0.122251 |  I wonder what being too fair in one end of the stupid rule.
[2487.84 - 2490.80] P:1755.73 E:0.130288 |  Anyway, the free kick is a vote to be taken by Manchester United.
[2490.80 - 2491.84] P:1566.63 E:0.129838 |  Four minutes to go to halftime.
[2491.84 - 2492.72] P:1525.34 E:0.126030 |  They're leading too near.
[2492.72 - 2493.52] P:1583.30 E:0.140993 |  Teed up for Rooney.
[2493.52 - 2494.32] P:1954.23 E:0.129616 |  Rooney shot!
[2494.32 - 2494.88] P:1830.54 E:0.163497 |  Into the net!
[2496.00 - 2500.40] P:1776.15 E:0.145921 |  Rooney scores again and it's an emphatic first half for Manchester United.
[2500.40 - 2502.88] P:1825.52 E:0.150607 |  Manchester United three, Arsenal nil.
[2502.88 - 2504.16] P:1869.83 E:0.125785 |  Great free kick.
[2504.16 - 2505.04] P:1808.04 E:0.145493 |  Great free kick.
[2505.60 - 2507.68] P:1830.58 E:0.148988 |  Just played into the man who just stopped the ball.
[2507.68 - 2512.88] P:1844.32 E:0.142426 |  Rooney just moves a yard to his right-hand side and just curls it into the top corner.
[2512.88 - 2513.28] P:1840.39 E:0.135356 |  Brilliant.
[2514.80 - 2518.00] P:1697.75 E:0.152785 |  Anything City can do, Manchester United will try to do.
[2519.60 - 2521.84] P:1754.58 E:0.135130 |  City won 5-1 at Tottenham.
[2522.80 - 2528.48] P:1766.71 E:0.145254 |  And you do fear worry for Arsenal the way things are going here at Old Trapper.
[2529.28 - 2530.16] P:1866.93 E:0.090813 |  Well,
[2530.16 - 2533.20] P:1734.77 E:0.140184 |  one of the reasons you'd worry not just the fact it's 3-0
[2533.76 - 2536.64] P:1735.27 E:0.133826 |  is because four to five of them don't look as though they're bothered.
[2536.64 - 2538.64] P:1770.64 E:0.129931 |  I mean, I find that unbelievable.
[2542.48 - 2549.36] P:1730.81 E:0.116687 |  Well, United I think are probably looking better for the poverty of Arsenal's display.
[2549.36 - 2553.20] P:1735.42 E:0.122538 |  Yeah, but even so, you've still got to beat the team that you play against.
[2553.20 - 2555.76] P:1599.32 E:0.128967 |  Ramsey coming forward from the kickoff now.
[2555.76 - 2559.52] P:1729.10 E:0.120057 |  Ramsey plays it to Arshav and Arshav and into the penalty.
[2559.52 - 2560.80] P:1805.12 E:0.109126 |  The shot takes a couple of defection.
[2560.80 - 2562.40] P:1792.54 E:0.129109 |  Ramsey has an opportunity.
[2562.40 - 2567.36] P:1870.17 E:0.129834 |  Can't squeeze room for the shot and it should be cleared by Smalling and he's out of play.
[2567.36 - 2568.24] P:1788.42 E:0.137253 |  Goes for throwing.
[2568.24 - 2573.12] P:1844.30 E:0.131011 |  Ramsey was unlucky because he actually worked himself half yard and when he went from right
[2573.12 - 2576.56] P:1770.43 E:0.124514 |  to left about to clip it left foot toward goal, I think he started to slip.
[2578.56 - 2582.80] P:1650.33 E:0.114633 |  Throw in taken by Traorio in the far side of the field and then he,
[2583.84 - 2586.08] P:1568.12 E:0.144691 |  having taken the return pass tries to make progress.
[2586.64 - 2590.80] P:1740.36 E:0.115996 |  Foulters, Rooney the latest goal scorer back to Anderson.
[2590.80 - 2596.32] P:1638.63 E:0.099363 |  Anderson couldn't find Danny Koshelny to Jenkinson near side of the field
[2596.32 - 2598.96] P:1627.04 E:0.127872 |  and the young man comes forward and stabs it to Wolcott.
[2598.96 - 2601.12] P:1562.02 E:0.112594 |  Where's Wolcott been over the last 10 or 15 minutes?
[2601.84 - 2603.52] P:1768.86 E:0.153767 |  He's tackled there by Ashley Young.
[2603.52 - 2605.04] P:1829.85 E:0.116728 |  Well, he's not been thrown to Jenkinson.
[2605.04 - 2605.28] P:1463.38 E:0.112398 |  That's for certain.
[2605.28 - 2608.16] P:1825.17 E:0.142486 |  Paul Bregs-Rosinski, Jenkinson then crosses too deep.
[2608.16 - 2609.68] P:1780.21 E:0.114408 |  It's behind for a goal kick.
[2613.12 - 2615.20] P:1728.85 E:0.134951 |  I wonder what he says at halftime, Venger.
[2616.56 - 2618.32] P:1555.07 E:0.077645 |  I'd love to know.
[2619.12 - 2621.52] P:1696.43 E:0.116751 |  Apparently he doesn't speak for the first five minutes, does he?
[2622.64 - 2623.76] P:1609.73 E:0.151388 |  Did I think about it?
[2623.76 - 2624.40] P:1675.98 E:0.120266 |  Well, yeah, no.
[2624.40 - 2627.28] P:1749.55 E:0.133487 |  And that's some guy coming to you and maybe chasing the boots and the strip.
[2627.28 - 2630.32] P:1762.59 E:0.126113 |  And he says because he thinks 15 minutes is too long.
[2632.32 - 2634.48] P:1593.52 E:0.158102 |  Maybe 19 minutes is too long to have to play.
[2634.48 - 2635.52] P:1652.42 E:0.132872 |  You better know what he means.
[2635.52 - 2639.44] P:1679.25 E:0.114412 |  He said if I speak to him in the first five minutes, I have to tend to have forgotten what I said.
[2640.72 - 2645.28] P:1686.14 E:0.140680 |  Anderson streets the ball away towards the right side towards Nani, headed away by Traorio.
[2645.36 - 2647.60] P:1759.66 E:0.119515 |  Collected by Smalling, well done, Smalling.
[2647.60 - 2648.32] P:1668.53 E:0.130155 |  Finding Nani.
[2648.32 - 2652.96] P:1802.66 E:0.127731 |  Nani's crossing towards Hernandez, intercepted by Kishelny behind for a corner.
[2652.96 - 2655.04] P:1895.72 E:0.134784 |  Yeah, well done, Kishelny, this time, certainly.
[2655.04 - 2659.28] P:1832.53 E:0.123509 |  But again, it's Manchester United players in that final third, Alan.
[2659.28 - 2661.20] P:1788.15 E:0.147763 |  They just deliver all the time, don't they?
[2661.20 - 2662.72] P:1697.88 E:0.127208 |  If the ball's on, they just play it.
[2666.40 - 2668.08] P:1601.87 E:0.161049 |  Goodness, we're not even out of August yet,
[2668.08 - 2671.04] P:1822.49 E:0.132399 |  but it feels like the surrender of North London this weekend.
[2671.04 - 2672.00] P:1851.39 E:0.147996 |  Have you seen where Rooney is?
[2673.20 - 2674.40] P:1397.64 E:0.133748 |  What is really doing 30?
[2674.40 - 2676.24] P:1637.18 E:0.151447 |  You know why? He's only got 10 yards to walk to the...
[2676.24 - 2677.04] P:1345.02 E:0.135656 |  Completely unmarked.
[2677.60 - 2681.92] P:1782.42 E:0.109015 |  The corner came in and it's caught easily by Mr. Chesney.
[2682.64 - 2684.64] P:1615.46 E:0.113215 |  What's the period behind Rooney being out there?
[2684.64 - 2687.76] P:1580.91 E:0.118558 |  I think you thought ref might blow for half time and he was straight in, wasn't he?
[2687.76 - 2688.72] P:1861.20 E:0.165775 |  Into the dressing room.
[2689.92 - 2691.44] P:1730.10 E:0.130274 |  It was in for a pie and mushy peas.
[2693.12 - 2695.12] P:1439.34 E:0.147955 |  Or a visit to a little cubicle, I don't know.
[2696.80 - 2699.36] P:1352.36 E:0.122679 |  But I think we've got some time to be added on
[2700.40 - 2703.36] P:1595.78 E:0.131896 |  until we see how quickly Rooney makes to the dressing room.
[2705.04 - 2708.00] P:1744.62 E:0.141614 |  He's scored one of three Manchester United goals here
[2708.96 - 2710.32] P:1553.63 E:0.128338 |  so far in the first half.
[2711.44 - 2712.72] P:1361.12 E:0.119093 |  And they're not flattered by it.
[2713.28 - 2716.40] P:1750.60 E:0.107763 |  Actually, Young chips the ball behind Smalling
[2716.40 - 2717.68] P:1657.18 E:0.118890 |  and straight out of play it goes.
[2718.72 - 2719.60] P:1771.50 E:0.131569 |  You tend to say sorry.
[2719.60 - 2721.60] P:1596.45 E:0.113423 |  Well, you tend to forget about his goal, don't you?
[2723.04 - 2723.68] P:1561.35 E:0.119551 |  Great, wouldn't it?
[2725.12 - 2725.60] P:1338.36 E:0.116091 |  Excellent.
[2727.04 - 2729.28] P:1800.65 E:0.149110 |  Manchester United three Arsenal nil
[2729.28 - 2731.76] P:1371.32 E:0.100487 |  and we're about to be told by the fourth official
[2731.76 - 2735.36] P:1676.30 E:0.113157 |  how much extra pain Arsenal will have to endure
[2735.92 - 2738.40] P:1596.44 E:0.113867 |  before the five minutes of silence from Arsene Wenger.
[2739.28 - 2740.80] P:1572.33 E:0.129423 |  Jones heads the ball back.
[2740.80 - 2744.88] P:1780.45 E:0.119437 |  We've got three added minutes to the end of the first half.
[2744.88 - 2745.60] P:1928.65 E:0.123633 |  Just what you need.
[2746.24 - 2751.36] P:1729.28 E:0.099033 |  And of course, Dehaa also saved a penalty, remember, from Van Persing.
[2751.36 - 2752.40] P:1591.16 E:0.113251 |  That could have altered things.
[2752.40 - 2757.44] P:1659.30 E:0.106084 |  I don't think Arsenal are playing well enough to have deserved a 1-1 score line.
[2758.00 - 2760.00] P:1209.26 E:0.111576 |  But nevertheless, the lift that would have given them
[2760.88 - 2766.72] P:1756.32 E:0.107216 |  as it was Van Persing's soft spot kick was easily saved.
[2768.48 - 2769.44] P:1665.26 E:0.143768 |  Arsenal three kick.
[2769.44 - 2772.48] P:1658.39 E:0.107454 |  Kishelny to take it plays it to Juru.
[2774.64 - 2779.36] P:1638.97 E:0.113775 |  Juru onto Jenkinson near side of the field Arsenal right back to Kishelny.
[2779.36 - 2784.32] P:1574.44 E:0.108463 |  Kishelny takes it on his mid-drift and on to the far side and Treori.
[2784.88 - 2788.64] P:1622.33 E:0.107647 |  Treori now to Walcott on the left flank for a change.
[2788.64 - 2791.20] P:1545.03 E:0.112851 |  Walcott into Rositski onto Ramsey.
[2791.20 - 2792.80] P:1490.63 E:0.130251 |  Ramsey chips the ball forward.
[2792.80 - 2794.40] P:1415.49 E:0.121264 |  Oshavan heads it back to Walcott.
[2794.40 - 2796.08] P:1527.31 E:0.091732 |  Ockler from Walcott to take.
[2796.08 - 2798.80] P:1638.06 E:0.119127 |  But it's poofed in the air by Jones and then
[2798.80 - 2801.44] P:1476.80 E:0.141532 |  Young only beltered the ball back into his penalty area.
[2801.44 - 2802.64] P:1762.16 E:0.120357 |  Smalling headed it clear.
[2803.20 - 2806.56] P:1555.68 E:0.108442 |  Then Nani did enough to put off the Arsenal challenge
[2806.56 - 2809.20] P:1621.15 E:0.105539 |  and United still keep possession with Anderson.
[2809.20 - 2809.84] P:1510.62 E:0.127961 |  De Cleverie.
[2810.40 - 2812.48] P:1791.50 E:0.132658 |  Two minutes of added time still to go.
[2812.48 - 2814.48] P:1764.36 E:0.127265 |  Now Rooney spots the Chesney office line.
[2814.48 - 2815.68] P:1693.47 E:0.131470 |  Ships from long range.
[2815.68 - 2817.20] P:1675.43 E:0.137072 |  The Chesney gets back and saves.
[2818.16 - 2820.88] P:1917.30 E:0.135163 |  Yeah, good vision but Chesney knew James.
[2820.88 - 2823.28] P:1759.17 E:0.114594 |  He was always going to save it.
[2824.40 - 2826.72] P:1463.85 E:0.148538 |  You would hope for his sake or he would never live it down.
[2827.84 - 2830.64] P:1541.52 E:0.124934 |  Rositski over the halfway line left of the centre circle.
[2830.64 - 2834.00] P:1538.21 E:0.099032 |  Flicks it back to Oshavan onto Ramsey.
[2834.00 - 2835.28] P:1753.91 E:0.137318 |  Ramsey to Jenkinson.
[2835.28 - 2836.96] P:1568.27 E:0.132389 |  Jenkinson up to the edge of the penalty area
[2836.96 - 2840.40] P:1666.62 E:0.121236 |  and then his first touch was poor Evans plays it back to the hair
[2840.40 - 2842.48] P:1787.46 E:0.127072 |  and the hair's first-time clearance towards Rooney.
[2842.48 - 2844.80] P:1659.41 E:0.129762 |  He's been pushed in the back by Juru.
[2844.80 - 2846.00] P:1638.98 E:0.133601 |  Juru got away with it.
[2846.00 - 2847.84] P:1770.12 E:0.116343 |  Ball breaks to Ashley Young.
[2847.84 - 2849.52] P:1461.84 E:0.140992 |  Young feeds it through the middle towards Nani.
[2849.52 - 2851.28] P:1607.45 E:0.130877 |  Chesney out of his penalty area
[2851.28 - 2853.60] P:1670.49 E:0.108663 |  and he wax it up to the centre circle.
[2853.60 - 2856.64] P:1543.72 E:0.104895 |  Chesney down by Rositski to Kokolant.
[2857.28 - 2859.52] P:1610.04 E:0.124811 |  Kokolant to Rositski once more
[2859.52 - 2861.84] P:1741.15 E:0.112488 |  and then it's given away straight to Jones.
[2862.88 - 2865.04] P:1712.78 E:0.101880 |  Van Persie kind of touched the ball
[2865.04 - 2867.44] P:1405.17 E:0.091448 |  all that often in this first half.
[2867.44 - 2869.20] P:1556.97 E:0.104687 |  His most memorable touch was the penalty.
[2869.20 - 2872.56] P:1236.33 E:0.108656 |  The penalty which wasn't memorable at all.
[2872.56 - 2873.84] P:1658.22 E:0.132359 |  Anderson drills it forward.
[2873.84 - 2874.64] P:1640.49 E:0.136812 |  Rooney after it.
[2874.64 - 2875.84] P:1595.70 E:0.109967 |  Rooney is offside.
[2877.36 - 2878.24] P:1644.70 E:0.135777 |  Hard to spot there.
[2878.24 - 2880.48] P:1750.55 E:0.134393 |  A few stewards in yellow on that far side
[2880.48 - 2883.84] P:1702.38 E:0.097101 |  and I'm trying to spot the yellow flag of the assistant.
[2883.84 - 2885.04] P:1273.75 E:0.077967 |  Got it in the end
[2885.04 - 2886.64] P:1359.29 E:0.108810 |  and Arsenal got the free kick in the end.
[2886.64 - 2888.08] P:1635.41 E:0.094618 |  That would be the checkered flag though, wouldn't it?
[2888.08 - 2888.88] P:1114.54 E:0.146302 |  Whatever it is.
[2888.88 - 2889.36] P:1864.73 E:0.093943 |  You know what it is.
[2889.36 - 2890.40] P:1537.55 E:0.114275 |  Well, it's... Hold on a second.
[2890.40 - 2891.12] P:1887.35 E:0.114665 |  There's a checkered.
[2891.12 - 2892.32] P:1721.07 E:0.108730 |  It's white and red.
[2892.32 - 2893.52] P:1682.16 E:0.119444 |  Would it give you a chance?
[2893.52 - 2894.88] P:1789.30 E:0.107746 |  I think you'll find it's yellow and red.
[2896.48 - 2897.68] P:1365.99 E:0.123535 |  Yes, yellow and red.
[2897.68 - 2898.00] P:1179.76 E:0.095617 |  OK.
[2898.56 - 2900.24] P:1817.90 E:0.136457 |  And what more do you know about Sunoo?
[2900.24 - 2901.36] P:1693.97 E:0.115768 |  Me think there lies a problem here.
[2901.36 - 2901.84] P:1641.90 E:0.135737 |  I'm not too...
[2901.84 - 2902.40] P:1700.84 E:0.064678 |  A cup.
[2904.08 - 2904.96] P:1608.98 E:0.133047 |  A shavin'.
[2904.96 - 2906.40] P:1537.51 E:0.088497 |  Terrible cross.
[2906.40 - 2907.20] P:1437.57 E:0.145251 |  Only half cleared.
[2907.20 - 2908.16] P:1594.57 E:0.120853 |  A shavin' gets it back.
[2908.16 - 2909.04] P:1572.56 E:0.113685 |  Edge of the D.
[2909.04 - 2910.64] P:1633.81 E:0.136090 |  Ryzynski, end of the penalty.
[2910.64 - 2911.52] P:1721.83 E:0.126110 |  Walk up with a chance.
[2911.52 - 2913.84] P:1654.79 E:0.133370 |  Schitt's brought all the legs up to here.
[2913.84 - 2915.44] P:1652.95 E:0.129367 |  The hair felt again
[2915.44 - 2916.96] P:1534.54 E:0.129394 |  and Arsenal have a go back.
[2916.96 - 2919.52] P:1684.09 E:0.127743 |  Manchester United 3, Arsenal won.
[2919.52 - 2921.28] P:1865.14 E:0.107716 |  Yeah, well done, Walkup.
[2921.28 - 2922.56] P:1912.30 E:0.109211 |  Just passed through.
[2922.56 - 2924.32] P:1836.18 E:0.134921 |  Real sort of tight angle.
[2924.32 - 2925.84] P:1792.75 E:0.133225 |  He's hit it at the goalkeeper.
[2925.84 - 2927.44] P:1702.25 E:0.129844 |  He's gone down a bit like Bambi.
[2927.44 - 2928.64] P:1761.56 E:0.150686 |  His legs are all over the place
[2928.64 - 2931.44] P:1902.30 E:0.113931 |  and it's actually gone straight through his legs as well.
[2931.44 - 2932.00] P:1711.40 E:0.160200 |  3-1.
[2933.52 - 2934.56] P:1758.60 E:0.158313 |  Well, it's as well he's got
[2935.44 - 2937.76] P:1769.27 E:0.128281 |  such a contribution further upfield
[2937.76 - 2938.88] P:1762.30 E:0.113250 |  from Manchester United
[2938.88 - 2940.88] P:1713.00 E:0.131703 |  because that was definitely a goal keeping him at stake.
[2940.88 - 2943.44] P:1724.22 E:0.142858 |  Just a strange way he was Alan, the way he set himself.
[2943.44 - 2944.32] P:1136.66 E:0.139649 |  Oh dear, oh dear.
[2944.32 - 2945.36] P:1516.15 E:0.126229 |  Just seeing the replay,
[2945.36 - 2946.96] P:1608.65 E:0.128446 |  which is even worse than the first sight.
[2948.08 - 2949.20] P:1581.43 E:0.152982 |  We've had our added time.
[2950.00 - 2951.68] P:1506.72 E:0.146746 |  Referee hardware blows his whistle
[2952.24 - 2955.36] P:1765.90 E:0.133412 |  and reflect, Mark, if you will, on a 3-1 scoreline
[2955.36 - 2957.12] P:1855.54 E:0.107344 |  which could have been 6-1, 6-2.
[2957.12 - 2958.56] P:1864.03 E:0.131738 |  Yeah, it could certainly have been 6-1.
[2958.56 - 2961.20] P:1744.66 E:0.122033 |  And I think, you know, quite a few of the performances
[2961.28 - 2964.24] P:1556.26 E:0.124068 |  of some of the Arsenal players have been very, very poor.
[2964.24 - 2965.12] P:1789.89 E:0.130932 |  At least four of them.
[2965.12 - 2967.12] P:1658.46 E:0.120157 |  Manchester United have been at the most rampant,
[2967.12 - 2968.32] P:1691.32 E:0.117776 |  they started high tempo.
[2968.88 - 2970.40] P:1697.00 E:0.128133 |  But in saying that, after the first goal,
[2970.40 - 2973.12] P:1722.56 E:0.117664 |  well-capitalised on a mistake by the two centre backs,
[2973.84 - 2976.48] P:1684.20 E:0.131248 |  you know, honestly, that Van Persche had a great chance
[2976.48 - 2977.44] P:1607.64 E:0.119539 |  to make it 1-1.
[2977.44 - 2978.96] P:1741.11 E:0.113113 |  And then the next thing is,
[2978.96 - 2981.20] P:1682.71 E:0.135948 |  Manchester United go down the other end of the score.
[2981.20 - 2982.96] P:1808.92 E:0.134594 |  Two sensational goals afterwards.
[2982.96 - 2986.00] P:1739.56 E:0.126438 |  Goals two and three from Jung and from Rooney.
[2986.00 - 2989.52] P:1655.99 E:0.125365 |  A reply by Wolcott, but I have to say that this scoreline
[2989.52 - 2992.16] P:1687.15 E:0.110807 |  could be anything in Manchester United's favour.
[2992.16 - 2995.28] P:1764.48 E:0.135338 |  As it is, it's Manchester United 3, Arsenal 1.
[2995.28 - 2997.76] P:1652.65 E:0.140751 |  And they'll have to win by five clear goals
[2997.76 - 3000.88] P:1771.61 E:0.132730 |  if they're to join Manchester City at the top of the table.
[3000.88 - 3005.20] P:1657.23 E:0.123014 |  Manchester City beating Spurs, 5-1 at White Heart Lane earlier today.
[3005.20 - 3008.80] P:1799.27 E:0.129144 |  Reaction to come from that and Newcastle's 2-1 win over Fulham.
[3008.80 - 3010.48] P:1860.62 E:0.134494 |  West Brom against Stoke is still going on,
[3010.48 - 3012.48] P:1449.06 E:0.134705 |  but the deadlock has been finally broken.
[3012.48 - 3013.84] P:1619.56 E:0.115516 |  Alistair Bruce Ball.
[3013.84 - 3015.60] P:1872.74 E:0.095250 |  We're into four minutes of added time.
[3015.60 - 3017.84] P:1991.47 E:0.123562 |  Stoke scored in the 90th minute of the game.
[3017.92 - 3020.24] P:1776.18 E:0.132864 |  There's a volley here from Malumba, which goes flashing wide.
[3020.24 - 3022.16] P:1911.89 E:0.131427 |  So it's West Brom nil, Stoke 1,
[3022.16 - 3024.72] P:1932.01 E:0.110207 |  which if West Brom lose, will mean three straight defeats
[3024.72 - 3025.76] P:1888.54 E:0.125780 |  at the start of the season.
[3025.76 - 3027.60] P:1852.38 E:0.118152 |  It is a goal that will have to be watched
[3027.60 - 3029.60] P:1853.14 E:0.117711 |  on match of the day 2 tonight.
[3029.60 - 3031.68] P:1858.87 E:0.106306 |  There is some controversy about it.
[3031.68 - 3035.36] P:1752.16 E:0.125821 |  A long ball came bouncing through to the edge of the West Bomb area.
[3035.36 - 3038.08] P:1807.22 E:0.109106 |  Gabrielle Tamas was trying to shepherd it back to Ben Foster.
[3038.08 - 3040.80] P:1763.22 E:0.119417 |  Ben Foster came out, put his hands up,
[3040.80 - 3042.88] P:1640.27 E:0.130690 |  and he claims he had the ball in both hands,
[3042.88 - 3045.20] P:1797.51 E:0.111428 |  and it was kicked out of them by Ryan Shotten,
[3045.20 - 3047.12] P:1786.82 E:0.112659 |  who came in with a challenge with his foot up.
[3047.12 - 3049.52] P:1722.34 E:0.120112 |  I don't think Foster ever had the ball under control,
[3049.52 - 3052.08] P:1848.27 E:0.104456 |  and I think the reason he is claiming that he did
[3052.08 - 3054.80] P:1827.74 E:0.115469 |  is basically to make up for an embarrassing mistake by himself.
[3054.80 - 3056.16] P:1703.65 E:0.126769 |  I don't think he had both hands on it.
[3056.16 - 3057.68] P:1753.32 E:0.131116 |  I think he could have been braver.
[3057.68 - 3059.84] P:1898.80 E:0.115325 |  It's West Brom nil, Stoke 1.
[3059.84 - 3061.36] P:1922.25 E:0.112537 |  It's been an awful game, I have to say.
[3061.36 - 3063.20] P:1899.26 E:0.120140 |  We've got two minutes of added time to be played,
[3063.20 - 3065.68] P:1757.51 E:0.117010 |  but I think Ben Foster, former Stoke keeper, by the way,
[3065.68 - 3068.80] P:1773.03 E:0.119360 |  that was where he started his career, was at fault for the goal.
[3068.80 - 3071.52] P:1831.17 E:0.110780 |  Ryan Shotten has scored West Brom nil, Stoke 1.
[3071.52 - 3074.48] P:1604.46 E:0.141951 |  Well, they are specialising in late goals, aren't they, Stoke?
[3074.56 - 3077.36] P:1397.25 E:0.131342 |  With equaliser at Norwich not so long ago,
[3077.36 - 3080.96] P:2044.55 E:0.122671 |  with Kenwin Jones scoring in the 94th minute.
[3080.96 - 3083.84] P:1770.32 E:0.142600 |  It was, last time we heard from Steve May at Vicarage Road,
[3083.84 - 3087.12] P:1807.01 E:0.135915 |  Watford 1, Birmingham 1, but there have been two goals, Steve.
[3087.12 - 3089.76] P:1980.80 E:0.108194 |  Yes, it's Watford 2, Birmingham City 2 now.
[3089.76 - 3093.52] P:1823.27 E:0.121641 |  It looks as if we're looking at Watford's first home point of the season.
[3093.52 - 3095.60] P:1852.53 E:0.113142 |  They've scored their first home goals of the season,
[3095.60 - 3097.84] P:1874.28 E:0.124959 |  so they'll be quite delighted about that.
[3097.84 - 3100.56] P:1683.60 E:0.115044 |  And in fact, Martin Taylor, big Martin Taylor,
[3100.56 - 3102.40] P:1742.66 E:0.111947 |  formerly, of course, of Birmingham City,
[3102.40 - 3106.40] P:1887.13 E:0.123068 |  has just equalised with a header after Mayhill failed to hold a shot.
[3106.40 - 3110.40] P:1791.68 E:0.108859 |  And that was just after Chris Wood had put Birmingham back in the lead.
[3110.40 - 3112.80] P:1745.71 E:0.113936 |  Terrible defending from Watford on the right-hand side.
[3112.80 - 3115.20] P:1674.65 E:0.116365 |  They left Wood completely out on his own,
[3115.20 - 3117.52] P:1719.46 E:0.107836 |  Wood cut in and placed it past Loach.
[3117.52 - 3119.92] P:1838.25 E:0.106363 |  That was a second goal for Birmingham,
[3119.92 - 3122.64] P:1697.96 E:0.111766 |  and then the equaliser, as I say, from Martin Taylor.
[3122.64 - 3123.84] P:1633.29 E:0.109928 |  We're still playing here.
[3123.84 - 3126.08] P:1884.15 E:0.093345 |  It's Watford 2, Birmingham City 2.
[3126.08 - 3127.84] P:1557.12 E:0.151678 |  In the Clydesdale Bank Premier League today,
[3127.84 - 3130.16] P:1877.51 E:0.130954 |  two goals from Gary Hooper in the first half,
[3130.16 - 3132.56] P:1901.48 E:0.124443 |  gave Celtic a 2-0 win at St. Mirren.
[3132.56 - 3135.12] P:1453.67 E:0.159931 |  Rangers hoping to go above them playing Aberdeen today.
[3135.12 - 3135.92] P:1505.29 E:0.147538 |  Ian Turner.
[3135.92 - 3137.92] P:1850.19 E:0.108742 |  We're into stoppage time at the end of the game.
[3137.92 - 3139.12] P:1603.80 E:0.138240 |  Rangers won Aberdeen 0,
[3139.12 - 3141.44] P:1597.87 E:0.137199 |  and Rangers will be going back to the top of the league.
[3141.44 - 3144.00] P:1802.46 E:0.136713 |  And it looks as if they will extend their unbeaten home record
[3144.00 - 3146.88] P:1803.92 E:0.112085 |  against Aberdeen to 37 games.
[3146.88 - 3150.24] P:1901.37 E:0.119115 |  Stephen Davis expertly put Rangers in front in 15 minutes.
[3150.24 - 3152.64] P:1733.68 E:0.121001 |  The only highlight of a terrible first half.
[3152.64 - 3154.16] P:1919.27 E:0.116552 |  Doing much better in the second,
[3154.16 - 3156.40] P:1667.82 E:0.115095 |  Aberdeen have pushed at every opportunity.
[3156.40 - 3159.84] P:1780.44 E:0.121844 |  Ricky Foster really should have made it 1-1 with a diving header
[3159.84 - 3163.84] P:1773.42 E:0.111710 |  after Alan McGregor had pushed out a Scott Vernon shot from 20 yards.
[3163.84 - 3166.56] P:1625.78 E:0.119942 |  But he only hit the bar with that, and over it went,
[3166.56 - 3168.64] P:1908.64 E:0.108490 |  and there went Aberdeen's chances,
[3168.64 - 3171.44] P:1712.99 E:0.113831 |  of at least, if not a victory, a famous draw.
[3171.44 - 3173.76] P:1591.03 E:0.108030 |  We've got about one minute of added time to go.
[3173.76 - 3175.44] P:1684.16 E:0.122870 |  It's Rangers won Aberdeen 0.
[3175.44 - 3178.64] P:1792.66 E:0.152165 |  How Hibbs could do with a bit of luck, or just a goal at heart today?
[3178.64 - 3180.88] P:1612.80 E:0.149960 |  Hibbs bottom of the table, Brian McLaughlin.
[3180.88 - 3183.92] P:1933.67 E:0.113462 |  Yeah, and they need a goal, certainly, to get back into this game.
[3183.92 - 3185.44] P:1871.49 E:0.128802 |  They trailed by one goal to now,
[3185.44 - 3187.36] P:1720.77 E:0.109454 |  we're just a minute now, into the second half.
[3187.44 - 3189.92] P:1825.89 E:0.132069 |  Ryan Stevenson scoring the only goal so far,
[3189.92 - 3192.32] P:1934.02 E:0.112335 |  just six minutes before half time,
[3192.32 - 3195.12] P:1781.95 E:0.116661 |  but it was a deserved half-time lead for the home side.
[3195.12 - 3197.20] P:1972.26 E:0.117851 |  Hibbs though, came out strong in the second half,
[3197.20 - 3198.80] P:1697.10 E:0.139184 |  and already had one shot and goal.
[3198.80 - 3202.08] P:1929.09 E:0.120165 |  Ivan Sprill from 25 yards, testing Marine Kello.
[3202.08 - 3203.20] P:1947.71 E:0.093012 |  But they just can't get through.
[3203.20 - 3204.16] P:1712.40 E:0.135922 |  Hearts won Hibbs now.
[3204.16 - 3206.40] P:1583.84 E:0.156307 |  Well, it sounded like Rangers were cruising to victory
[3206.40 - 3208.00] P:1702.10 E:0.153000 |  towards the end of their game against Aberdeen,
[3208.00 - 3211.12] P:1844.96 E:0.152373 |  but there's been another goal who's got it, Ian Turner.
[3211.12 - 3213.76] P:1995.92 E:0.127411 |  Yeah, Rangers have it, it's now 2-0 Rangers.
[3213.76 - 3216.40] P:1845.51 E:0.118742 |  It's Stephen Naismith with his fourth of the season.
[3216.48 - 3218.96] P:1832.39 E:0.120172 |  It was a free kick from 20 yards, fired in.
[3218.96 - 3222.56] P:1538.65 E:0.121500 |  A terrible fumble by Aberdeen goalkeeper David Gonzalez,
[3222.56 - 3225.12] P:1818.15 E:0.118231 |  and there was Naismith from two yards to prod at home,
[3225.12 - 3227.44] P:1728.22 E:0.122952 |  and it will now be Rangers three points.
[3227.44 - 3228.72] P:1595.97 E:0.120277 |  They lead Aberdeen 2-0.
[3229.44 - 3231.76] P:1918.42 E:0.162081 |  If you missed it earlier, all sorts of shenanigans
[3231.76 - 3232.96] P:1942.81 E:0.117082 |  at the World Athletics Championships,

[3468.48 - 3470.56] P:2040.20 E:0.117039 |  So many goals from all the games today,
[3470.56 - 3472.16] P:2029.21 E:0.099262 |  particularly from Manchester.

[3478.88 - 3479.84] P:1778.75 E:0.126985 |  Steve May.
[3479.84 - 3481.84] P:1818.48 E:0.122699 |  Yes, Watford two, Birmingham City two.
[3482.48 - 3486.00] P:1682.35 E:0.117975 |  Very exciting finish for the Watford fans at the end of this match
[3486.00 - 3490.24] P:1752.13 E:0.121648 |  as Martin Taylor had a free header into Bowers-Mihalds' goal
[3490.24 - 3493.04] P:1770.61 E:0.111553 |  after Milad failed to deal with a 20 yard shot.
[3493.04 - 3497.60] P:1636.31 E:0.108341 |  Moments before that, Chris Wood had seemingly given Birmingham the win.
[3497.60 - 3501.52] P:1741.88 E:0.119938 |  This was after Marvin Sadell had levelled Adam Rooney's first half goal,
[3501.52 - 3503.76] P:1671.61 E:0.116004 |  probably in the end the right result for both sides.
[3503.76 - 3506.88] P:1616.54 E:0.098387 |  And certainly for Watford, it was their first home points of the season
[3506.88 - 3509.68] P:1694.03 E:0.099916 |  and their first goals at Vicarage Road this season.
[3509.68 - 3511.28] P:1691.24 E:0.091808 |  Watford two, Birmingham two.
[3511.28 - 3513.12] P:1782.04 E:0.164070 |  In the Clydesdale Bank Premier League,
[3513.12 - 3515.76] P:1958.98 E:0.147466 |  anything that Celtic can do, Rangers can do two,
[3515.76 - 3518.24] P:1583.07 E:0.141469 |  both went out of Europe and both won 2-0 today.
[3518.24 - 3520.32] P:1819.42 E:0.145567 |  Here's Ian Turner, what's Rangers Aberdeen?
[3520.32 - 3523.44] P:1770.53 E:0.130330 |  Yes, as you say, they have beaten Aberdeen by two goals 2-0.
[3523.44 - 3526.64] P:1878.84 E:0.123432 |  This was not a good Rangers performance, let me stress that.
[3526.64 - 3527.60] P:1671.85 E:0.152576 |  But it was good enough.
[3527.60 - 3529.92] P:1859.26 E:0.116809 |  Steven Davis gave them the lead on 14 minutes
[3529.92 - 3532.16] P:1881.31 E:0.123646 |  after being set up by Nikita Jalevich.
[3532.16 - 3535.28] P:1896.92 E:0.120210 |  Ricky Foster really should have equalised in the second half
[3535.28 - 3538.48] P:1618.42 E:0.125206 |  when Alan McGregor pammed a ball right into his path.
[3538.48 - 3541.20] P:1465.69 E:0.128396 |  His diving header, however, hit the bar and went over.
[3541.20 - 3544.56] P:1998.24 E:0.115758 |  And then right at the death, Steven Naismith was first to pounce
[3544.56 - 3547.28] P:1701.94 E:0.116161 |  on a mistake by the Aberdeen goalkeeper after a free kick.
[3547.28 - 3549.04] P:1975.08 E:0.112022 |  He tapped it in from close range.
[3549.04 - 3552.24] P:1642.72 E:0.125854 |  Rangers go to the top of the lead by beating Aberdeen 2-0.
[3553.12 - 3555.44] P:1572.85 E:0.145422 |  Now, earlier on this afternoon, the Barclays Premier League,
[3555.44 - 3557.52] P:1899.52 E:0.134242 |  Manchester City put in another really strong
[3557.52 - 3559.92] P:1996.07 E:0.130116 |  performance. Nasri went straight into the side.
[3560.56 - 3563.12] P:1656.63 E:0.132784 |  They're so much more threatening up front than last season.
[3563.12 - 3568.64] P:1793.04 E:0.118462 |  Today they won 5-1 at Tottenham to go to the top of the Premier League.
[3568.64 - 3571.68] P:1963.47 E:0.108591 |  Four of those goals came from Eddin Jekko,
[3571.68 - 3574.24] P:1881.96 E:0.082330 |  and he's been speaking to Jonathan Pierce.
[3574.24 - 3576.72] P:1505.30 E:0.122506 |  Could you dream about a start of the season like this?
[3576.72 - 3580.88] P:1169.69 E:0.090569 |  No, I have to say no, because it's something fantastic.
[3580.88 - 3585.52] P:1457.05 E:0.106600 |  You know, with the team to have after three games, nine points,
[3585.52 - 3589.92] P:1197.41 E:0.093850 |  and I scored six goals, and it's amazing.
[3589.92 - 3592.40] P:1526.93 E:0.136854 |  Have you had a goal scoring spell like this?
[3592.40 - 3599.04] P:1339.79 E:0.104766 |  I think I never scored six goals in, I don't know, maybe first 10 games,
[3599.04 - 3604.00] P:1416.80 E:0.100237 |  or maybe 15, and now it's six in only three games.
[3605.52 - 3608.96] P:1493.27 E:0.138396 |  What is the difference between you, the start of this season,
[3608.96 - 3611.76] P:1583.23 E:0.102084 |  and when you first came to English football last January?
[3611.76 - 3615.36] P:1346.84 E:0.114055 |  Yeah, when I came, everything was difficult for me,
[3615.36 - 3620.56] P:1116.06 E:0.131475 |  because I was the new in the best league in the world.
[3620.56 - 3624.08] P:1206.16 E:0.131745 |  And I said, OK, from the beginning it will be difficult,
[3624.08 - 3627.44] P:993.15 E:0.140596 |  but then I didn't have a pre-season with the team,
[3627.44 - 3630.96] P:1212.69 E:0.133169 |  and now I feel much better, much stronger, and after pre-season,
[3632.56 - 3635.20] P:1205.66 E:0.143756 |  everything is different, and I know the league better,
[3635.20 - 3641.52] P:1339.93 E:0.110111 |  and the players against us, we play, everything is different.
[3642.40 - 3646.64] P:1326.87 E:0.135635 |  How easy is it to play when you have Nazary, Silva, Aguero?
[3647.36 - 3652.64] P:1334.35 E:0.103643 |  Yeah, of course. I think we played today like a team, fantastic game,
[3652.64 - 3656.56] P:1326.35 E:0.113525 |  and I think also that Nazary will be fantastic for us.
[3657.68 - 3660.64] P:1431.84 E:0.127905 |  Is it near perfection playing football like this?
[3661.92 - 3665.76] P:1379.65 E:0.117833 |  I think today was fantastic, but it's just the start of the season,
[3665.76 - 3670.88] P:1198.50 E:0.116950 |  and we have nine points. It's perfect, I can say,
[3670.88 - 3674.16] P:1385.40 E:0.107938 |  but it's a lot of games to the end of the season.
[3674.16 - 3677.36] P:1851.13 E:0.119492 |  Eddin Jekyll with Jonathan Pierce, Jekyll scoring four goals today.
[3677.36 - 3679.44] P:1734.06 E:0.128573 |  When Harry Redknapp became the Spurs manager,
[3679.44 - 3681.44] P:1556.12 E:0.114226 |  they were right at the bottom of the Premier League
[3681.44 - 3682.96] P:1594.25 E:0.110155 |  when he took over from Juan de Ramiz,
[3682.96 - 3686.88] P:1877.67 E:0.119413 |  and that's exactly where they are now, not a great start to the season,
[3686.88 - 3690.08] P:1790.74 E:0.119953 |  bottom of the league after losing their first two games of the season
[3690.08 - 3691.76] P:2181.98 E:0.089807 |  to both Manchester teams.
[3691.76 - 3694.16] P:1438.26 E:0.123365 |  It's been difficult, two obviously, two very good sides,
[3694.16 - 3696.96] P:1325.51 E:0.122262 |  but today, again, for 35 minutes until they scored,
[3696.96 - 3698.24] P:1664.58 E:0.118001 |  we had as many chances today.
[3698.48 - 3702.56] P:1130.25 E:0.126301 |  I mean, we were opening them up, and they were, it was an end to end game.
[3702.56 - 3705.68] P:1216.04 E:0.117305 |  It was a very open game, but it was always going to be an open game
[3705.68 - 3708.64] P:1240.83 E:0.120621 |  because of the way they set up today, and the way we played today.
[3708.64 - 3712.00] P:1239.22 E:0.124771 |  I ended up with two wingers, two midfield players
[3712.00 - 3715.52] P:1088.41 E:0.116009 |  who had not defensive minded, Rafa and behind the striker.
[3716.72 - 3718.72] P:1626.76 E:0.141609 |  Really, we almost played with six forwards
[3718.72 - 3721.68] P:1042.75 E:0.113766 |  because we haven't got any defensive minded midfield players
[3721.68 - 3725.44] P:1219.91 E:0.121758 |  or defensive players that I could even fill the team up with if I wanted to.
[3725.44 - 3727.04] P:1599.35 E:0.124274 |  So that's how we went about it.
[3727.04 - 3729.60] P:1389.56 E:0.126097 |  We were going to slug it out a little bit today,
[3729.60 - 3732.08] P:1166.31 E:0.121425 |  but unfortunately for us, they got the first goal,
[3732.08 - 3733.76] P:939.82 E:0.121095 |  and they were a threat.
[3733.76 - 3736.56] P:1044.03 E:0.105410 |  I mean, they've got world-class players, forwards, there's no doubt about that.
[3736.56 - 3738.80] P:1477.70 E:0.130827 |  It's only a start, it's two games into the season,
[3738.80 - 3741.28] P:1002.48 E:0.127456 |  and when the end of the season comes, we'll be banged there again.
[3741.28 - 3742.56] P:886.33 E:0.077220 |  I've got no doubts about that.
[3742.56 - 3745.12] P:1358.04 E:0.136783 |  You like the defensive midfield players today.
[3745.12 - 3748.56] P:1554.53 E:0.130425 |  Is there any movement to bring people into fill those holes?
[3748.56 - 3751.36] P:1500.02 E:0.135279 |  That the window is coming to the end?
[3752.00 - 3754.24] P:1504.93 E:0.137894 |  Oh, we're looking. We've got one or two options, you know,
[3754.24 - 3758.00] P:1183.56 E:0.123193 |  and we're hoping to do a couple of bits of business if we can.
[3758.00 - 3759.20] P:1132.99 E:0.117126 |  You know, we'll have to wait and see.
[3759.20 - 3761.36] P:1395.35 E:0.131954 |  The biggest problem for us has been that,
[3761.36 - 3764.64] P:1425.04 E:0.121944 |  I think there's been too much talk about our players leaving.
[3764.64 - 3766.72] P:1352.36 E:0.119253 |  I think it's been a really unsettling pre-season.
[3766.72 - 3769.84] P:1245.66 E:0.114331 |  It's probably the worst pre-season I've ever had since I've been in football.
[3769.84 - 3771.36] P:757.45 E:0.116435 |  I've not enjoyed it one little bit.
[3771.36 - 3774.32] P:1445.98 E:0.141796 |  You know, it's Lucas staying as he goes, and every day non-stop.
[3774.96 - 3776.24] P:973.43 E:0.118806 |  It's all we ever get talked about.
[3776.24 - 3779.04] P:976.33 E:0.124403 |  We've really had, you know, he's the main player for us,
[3779.04 - 3781.36] P:1253.68 E:0.142050 |  and he's been linked every day, even this morning on drive,
[3781.36 - 3784.56] P:1252.77 E:0.111196 |  and then suddenly there's a £40 million off of coming in from Chelsea.
[3784.56 - 3786.32] P:1042.03 E:0.121814 |  You know, he's supposed to be playing today.
[3786.32 - 3788.08] P:1214.61 E:0.124977 |  I speak to him at Barse 11.
[3788.08 - 3790.48] P:906.00 E:0.136076 |  He tells me whether he's right to play or not.
[3791.12 - 3793.92] P:1444.36 E:0.129385 |  It's not been the ideal preparation, you know,
[3793.92 - 3796.40] P:1489.64 E:0.136288 |  and then suddenly Crouch is supposed to be going to Stoke.
[3796.40 - 3798.48] P:1302.50 E:0.118839 |  Is he going? He's in my team.
[3798.48 - 3799.84] P:1061.03 E:0.136433 |  We're talking about him going today.
[3799.84 - 3801.76] P:894.71 E:0.095204 |  I mean, it's been a difficult time.
[3801.76 - 3802.96] P:1488.98 E:0.166225 |  Is there any truth in those things,
[3802.96 - 3805.12] P:1214.18 E:0.132828 |  or will things progress in the next 24 hours?
[3805.12 - 3806.08] P:1243.83 E:0.154649 |  No idea. I don't know.
[3806.08 - 3808.24] P:1360.43 E:0.128080 |  Whoever Chelsea have made a £40 million off,
[3808.24 - 3809.04] P:557.77 E:0.095798 |  I wouldn't have a clue.
[3809.04 - 3812.00] P:876.62 E:0.118049 |  They wouldn't... They're dealing with the chairman with that,
[3812.00 - 3813.28] P:1390.67 E:0.133818 |  and the chairman stands all along.
[3813.28 - 3814.56] P:935.77 E:0.123588 |  It's been... He's not going to sell him.
[3814.56 - 3817.60] P:1229.53 E:0.109929 |  So if he sells him now, he's going to leave, you know,
[3817.60 - 3819.04] P:1283.01 E:0.125694 |  he's going to leave us a little bit up the swanee,
[3819.04 - 3820.64] P:864.49 E:0.134862 |  and it really would be about three days to go.
[3820.64 - 3824.24] P:1055.27 E:0.114164 |  If you're going to sell him, I'm sure he would have sold him two months ago.
[3824.24 - 3825.68] P:1850.35 E:0.139589 |  Well, they are up the swanee at the moment.
[3825.68 - 3828.16] P:1455.85 E:0.137639 |  Bottom of the league after losing five-one today at home
[3828.16 - 3830.56] P:1953.90 E:0.122068 |  to Manchester City, Edgian Zecker scoring four.
[3830.56 - 3834.24] P:1837.12 E:0.121811 |  Elsewhere, Newcastle won 2-1 against Fulhamuts and James is partly on bests,
[3834.24 - 3836.08] P:2012.93 E:0.099942 |  scored both Newcastle goals.
[3836.08 - 3840.24] P:1852.84 E:0.123632 |  West Brom lost a stoke by a goal to Nill at the Hawthorns.
[3840.24 - 3844.24] P:1771.68 E:0.125303 |  In the championship, West Ham won 4-1 at Nottingham Forest.
[3844.88 - 3847.20] P:1789.36 E:0.142789 |  Vicarage Road, Watford and Birmingham drew 2-2,
[3847.20 - 3850.72] P:1800.16 E:0.133283 |  and in the SPL, Rangers won 2-0 against Aberdeen.
[3850.72 - 3853.28] P:1617.03 E:0.124202 |  Celtic won 2-0 at St. Mirren in the Edinburgh Derby.
[3853.28 - 3856.48] P:1806.96 E:0.108975 |  Hearts lead bottom of the table, Hibs by a goal to Nill.
[3856.48 - 3859.84] P:1753.39 E:0.128934 |  And at half time, in the final Barquese Premier League match of the day,
[3859.84 - 3863.52] P:1941.54 E:0.130395 |  Manchester United lead Arsenal by three goals to one.
[3863.52 - 3865.20] P:1421.94 E:0.093119 |  What could happen in the second half?
[3865.28 - 3867.36] P:1686.05 E:0.127873 |  Let's rejoin our commentary team at Old Trafford.
[3867.36 - 3870.24] P:1570.58 E:0.122670 |  Mark Lawrensen, Alan Green and first, Mike Ingram.
[3870.24 - 3872.56] P:1598.67 E:0.126563 |  Welcome back, it was an eventful first half.
[3873.68 - 3876.64] P:1717.64 E:0.126268 |  The Manchester United revised lineup.
[3876.64 - 3879.20] P:1600.05 E:0.126550 |  Remember, Welbeck got a hamstring injury.
[3879.20 - 3882.40] P:1730.57 E:0.133008 |  He scored the first goal, he got a hamstring injury after 35 minutes
[3882.96 - 3884.72] P:1656.70 E:0.138987 |  and was replaced by Hernandez.
[3884.72 - 3887.04] P:1697.24 E:0.143926 |  So the Manchester United team is the hayering goal,
[3887.04 - 3890.88] P:1691.11 E:0.112335 |  Smalling, Jones, Evans and Evera, third in hands on the bench today.
[3890.88 - 3896.00] P:1622.92 E:0.113210 |  Then Nani Anderson, cleverly young, who scored a terrific second goal,
[3896.00 - 3898.80] P:1713.91 E:0.114380 |  United and then up front, Hernandez and Rooney,
[3898.80 - 3901.28] P:1669.83 E:0.120158 |  Rooney who got the third from a free kick.
[3901.28 - 3903.12] P:1613.74 E:0.118012 |  The Arsenal line-up in a moment,
[3903.12 - 3905.44] P:1697.66 E:0.130245 |  Manchester United playing from left to right in the second half.
[3906.16 - 3908.00] P:1718.21 E:0.133530 |  Good challenge coming in from Juru.
[3908.00 - 3910.24] P:1554.06 E:0.124677 |  What will that goal do for Arsenal just before half-time?
[3910.24 - 3914.64] P:1752.91 E:0.109645 |  Van Persie doesn't collect it and Evans knocks it out for throw in the other side.
[3915.20 - 3917.60] P:1625.31 E:0.129416 |  The Arsenal line-up, very unfamiliar line-up,
[3917.60 - 3921.04] P:1921.06 E:0.130033 |  Shezhenin goal, Jenkinson, Kishelny, Juru and Troyori,
[3921.04 - 3923.68] P:1686.40 E:0.124656 |  Kokolan who did okay really, the youngster in midfield,
[3923.68 - 3926.80] P:1485.41 E:0.128102 |  Ramsey, Rizitski, Walcott, Van Persie and Arshavim.
[3927.68 - 3931.36] P:1629.06 E:0.126959 |  What happened in the first half was that after Welbeck scored for Manchester United,
[3931.36 - 3934.72] P:1631.23 E:0.113607 |  Howard Webb gave a penalty against Manchester United at Old Trafford
[3934.72 - 3936.56] P:1749.06 E:0.098404 |  and Van Persie missed it.
[3936.56 - 3938.16] P:1556.65 E:0.136481 |  Oh rather, Dehaet saved it.
[3938.72 - 3940.64] P:1705.33 E:0.122265 |  So Arsenal failed to equalise,
[3940.64 - 3943.52] P:1748.73 E:0.141299 |  Young made it 2-0, Rooney 3-0 and then right on half-time
[3943.52 - 3946.08] P:1751.21 E:0.155208 |  as Juru seems to be holding onto it, it was the other way round.
[3946.56 - 3948.08] P:1630.15 E:0.132183 |  Reckless given the free kick to Arsenal.
[3948.08 - 3950.08] P:1593.30 E:0.119825 |  No, at first it was the right way.
[3950.08 - 3952.72] P:1534.22 E:0.143828 |  Rooney held Juru before Juru held Rooney.
[3953.44 - 3957.92] P:1546.52 E:0.120860 |  And then right on half-time, Walcott beat Dehaet very easily.
[3957.92 - 3961.52] P:1689.99 E:0.128006 |  It was a poor goal for the keeper to let in after saving a penalty earlier.
[3961.52 - 3964.88] P:1728.68 E:0.126497 |  Rizitski now into Ramsey in the area, awkward bounce for him
[3964.88 - 3966.48] P:1822.04 E:0.120793 |  and it just wouldn't come down for him
[3966.48 - 3970.16] P:1716.06 E:0.134259 |  and Cleverley now bringing the ball out and he gets away from Aaron Ramsey.
[3970.16 - 3973.36] P:1841.14 E:0.133832 |  Still Cleverley, Hernandez wants it near side and he finds him.
[3973.44 - 3975.12] P:1526.82 E:0.136266 |  The Mexican, Hernandez on the ball.
[3975.12 - 3978.40] P:1871.69 E:0.123255 |  Cleverley wants to return pass, goes from Nani to Hernandez.
[3978.40 - 3981.60] P:1777.69 E:0.123600 |  Should have gone through to Cleverley but Arsenal block, it's Cochaland there.
[3981.60 - 3984.64] P:1770.47 E:0.136282 |  Of course the news of Wielbeck's injury means that he's out of the England squad.
[3984.64 - 3988.64] P:1654.70 E:0.120599 |  I'm sure he would have been in it tonight for the matches against Bulgaria and Wales.
[3989.52 - 3992.24] P:1616.73 E:0.130432 |  Now it's André Archevin on a yellow card remember,
[3992.24 - 3994.48] P:1728.40 E:0.132925 |  looking to release Jenkinson, not a bad ball.
[3994.48 - 3998.40] P:1846.30 E:0.131546 |  Evera comes in with a great challenge and it's out of the penalty area
[3998.40 - 4001.28] P:1799.56 E:0.112853 |  and Evans is there now to try and complete the clearance.
[4001.28 - 4005.20] P:1829.41 E:0.127048 |  Evans into Young, Young's scooped ball into Rooney.
[4005.20 - 4010.00] P:1819.46 E:0.134854 |  Rooney against Juru, the ball drops to Young and now Rooney once more.
[4011.20 - 4014.16] P:1668.08 E:0.129876 |  The lines are open for 6-0-6 with Mark Chapman and Robbie Savage.
[4014.16 - 4018.24] P:1762.29 E:0.124662 |  That comes after the game, a benthful day, I'm sure Spurs fans in particular,
[4018.24 - 4021.76] P:1774.79 E:0.129016 |  after the 5-1 home defeat will want to speak to 6-0-6.
[4021.76 - 4024.72] P:1816.53 E:0.149453 |  Nani now for Manchester United, good run into the penalty area.
[4024.72 - 4027.60] P:1824.36 E:0.135113 |  Rooney just couldn't stretch but Arsenal fail to clear
[4027.60 - 4029.20] P:1790.67 E:0.127310 |  and Ashley Young has a chance.
[4029.20 - 4032.40] P:1760.30 E:0.146065 |  Young saved at the near post by the keeper, comes out again
[4032.40 - 4034.64] P:1761.74 E:0.140872 |  and Ashley Young was almost in for a second time
[4034.64 - 4036.40] P:1860.42 E:0.139522 |  and I'm not sure if I'd hit the post as well.
[4036.96 - 4039.60] P:1916.71 E:0.139051 |  It's come to this near side and it's an Arsenal throw in
[4039.60 - 4041.36] P:1752.19 E:0.146176 |  and they were all over the place there defensively.
[4041.36 - 4045.36] P:1781.88 E:0.133077 |  Oh my, the number of times when Manchester United had been in there
[4045.36 - 4049.20] P:1705.96 E:0.117511 |  and had space in which to decide what to do,
[4049.76 - 4053.20] P:1653.78 E:0.135649 |  Rooney, Young, all those kind of players has been amazing.
[4053.76 - 4057.36] P:1801.93 E:0.134284 |  Manchester United's 3 Arsenal 1, so at the moment it's Manchester 8,
[4057.36 - 4059.92] P:1626.99 E:0.124298 |  North London 2 today in the two games.
[4060.48 - 4065.68] P:1750.83 E:0.126405 |  Earlier Spurs won Manchester City 5 and now Evans for Manchester United
[4065.68 - 4068.72] P:1791.66 E:0.142121 |  and a feature for me of the first half is we saw nothing of Arsenal
[4068.72 - 4070.64] P:1783.23 E:0.129538 |  venga at all in the technical area.
[4070.64 - 4074.08] P:1696.82 E:0.135886 |  He's led it to Pat Rice today completely and Pat Rice is there again
[4074.08 - 4077.76] P:1832.90 E:0.128166 |  as Young goes forward and now Young's gone over, hobbled down
[4079.12 - 4083.12] P:1748.42 E:0.139538 |  and he of course is another player who can expect international duty next weekend.
[4083.12 - 4085.52] P:1755.51 E:0.122922 |  I think he's just been caught across the shin mate.
[4085.52 - 4087.52] P:1644.43 E:0.109924 |  I don't think it's a muscle injury.
[4089.52 - 4091.68] P:1802.82 E:0.155656 |  I think he's caught across the shin by Jenkinson.
[4091.68 - 4093.44] P:1778.54 E:0.137496 |  Right, free kick to Manchester United.
[4096.40 - 4098.00] P:1828.30 E:0.134760 |  Howard with the referee then.
[4098.00 - 4102.64] P:1832.30 E:0.131364 |  Manchester United 3 Arsenal 1, at least Arsenal have managed to avoid
[4103.92 - 4105.68] P:1835.43 E:0.144252 |  going through three games at the start.
[4105.68 - 4108.56] P:1760.61 E:0.136126 |  As a welcome world service I was just making the point that at least here today
[4108.56 - 4111.04] P:1657.96 E:0.125585 |  Krumm of comfort for Arsenal, at least they've avoided.
[4111.04 - 4115.44] P:1673.97 E:0.107092 |  It's not a free kick by the way, it's going to be a throw in over on the fast.
[4115.92 - 4119.36] P:1844.43 E:0.141952 |  At least they've avoided going three games at the start of the season without scoring.
[4119.92 - 4123.68] P:1675.24 E:0.121737 |  Had that happened today, it would have been the first time since the early 50s.
[4123.68 - 4127.76] P:1853.28 E:0.123652 |  Walcott's goal right on half time is Arsenal give the ball back to Manchester United
[4127.76 - 4131.04] P:1771.44 E:0.119237 |  because the game stopped so that Young could receive attention and now it's Jones.
[4131.84 - 4136.88] P:1716.65 E:0.115378 |  This highly promising centre back, full back as well, midfield if necessary.
[4137.44 - 4140.80] P:1850.80 E:0.128531 |  Manchester United and Nani and Smalling who had an excellent first off.
[4140.80 - 4142.16] P:1828.98 E:0.140324 |  Great return ball now for Nani.
[4142.16 - 4147.36] P:1840.11 E:0.147159 |  Troyor is out of position, Nani into the penalty area, Rooney's waiting and Nani goes for glory.
[4147.36 - 4152.72] P:1813.58 E:0.145254 |  Selfishly really, nooks the ball over the bar into the crowd and Rooney just gives him a look at the far post.
[4152.72 - 4154.72] P:1783.31 E:0.123977 |  I think it's a glare more than a look.
[4154.72 - 4159.60] P:1725.73 E:0.127901 |  The other thing is under pressure from Troyori, Nani could have gone down in the penalty area,
[4159.60 - 4164.32] P:1784.02 E:0.129253 |  that would have been a penalty and then secondly he had to pick Rooney out once he got into the
[4164.32 - 4167.60] P:1915.65 E:0.127836 |  position where he was. The angle was just so tight.
[4168.56 - 4172.56] P:1713.76 E:0.123841 |  Jenkinson, header down to Young Cockaland in midfield.
[4172.56 - 4178.00] P:1676.71 E:0.131826 |  Cockaland now lifts it towards Arshavin on the near side and Smalling just takes it away from Arshavin
[4178.64 - 4185.04] P:1779.18 E:0.121947 |  and Dehaire clears towards Nani and Nani can't control it and it's a throw to Arsenal just in
[4185.04 - 4190.56] P:1754.67 E:0.133729 |  front of Pat Rice down this near side. This is five live and BBC World Service, Manchester United three,
[4191.20 - 4196.88] P:1761.96 E:0.141358 |  Arsenal one, United went into a three-nil lead inside 41 minutes, Arsenal missing a penalty to
[4196.88 - 4202.80] P:1757.59 E:0.130520 |  Hairst saving from Van Persie and now Arsenal with a goal on half time and Wolcott was fouled by Evera.
[4203.52 - 4210.24] P:1800.88 E:0.129744 |  I mean the clearest foul it Howard Webb flattened him, absolutely flattened Theo Wolcott who hasn't
[4210.24 - 4218.40] P:1801.13 E:0.110657 |  moved since then. Webb is just standing over him and I think he's going to be okay.
[4219.44 - 4223.36] P:1681.42 E:0.131463 |  As there's a moment of a break here just for the World Service in particular just
[4223.44 - 4227.92] P:1730.03 E:0.129242 |  to sum it up what you've seen so far. Well men against boys is probably the best summation I could
[4227.92 - 4233.36] P:1693.38 E:0.131923 |  give it Manchester United by far and away and much better than Arsenal in every single department
[4233.36 - 4238.48] P:1765.42 E:0.128940 |  maybe apart from the goalkeeper had a number of chances in the first half, converted three of
[4238.48 - 4244.32] P:1694.74 E:0.117854 |  possibly six, replied from Arsenal after a missed penalty was from Wolcott very very late but it's
[4244.32 - 4249.28] P:1697.78 E:0.130688 |  I think this game's turned into a matter of how many can or how many do and how many do Manchester
[4249.36 - 4250.88] P:1658.43 E:0.127395 |  United want to score here?
[4251.60 - 4258.80] P:1754.98 E:0.137814 |  Ashwin, poor Arsenal they're playing from right to left and he loses the ball so easily to Nani
[4258.80 - 4263.12] P:1789.14 E:0.151188 |  and Nani almost got that through to Rooney. Nani will go in again though you think United were
[4263.12 - 4268.32] P:1876.29 E:0.140868 |  trailing three-one Rooney's on side early ball into Watson and there's Juru takes no chances
[4268.32 - 4273.12] P:1898.67 E:0.138143 |  and can seize the corner. Sorry mate it looked as though for me as though Rooney was just off
[4273.12 - 4279.12] P:1893.58 E:0.125285 |  anyway he's gone now but again and you've touched on it the easy way in which Arshavin
[4279.12 - 4284.16] P:1819.10 E:0.134001 |  just lost the ball yet again himself and Rositski have been disgraceful in that department.
[4285.76 - 4290.64] P:1796.96 E:0.149535 |  The hungar ear of the two sides here are leading by three goals to one. Manchester United want more
[4290.64 - 4297.12] P:1809.81 E:0.124334 |  goals corner kick to them, header behind by Jenkins and it's still in play and it's scraped away by
[4297.12 - 4302.64] P:1821.25 E:0.120714 |  Kishelny again unconvincing at the back from Arsenal Evans keeps it in and finds
[4302.64 - 4309.20] P:1769.66 E:0.125744 |  Cleverley the young midfield player. Cleverley cross the field to Evra. Evra as Manchester United
[4309.20 - 4313.92] P:1785.74 E:0.131725 |  move forward once more. Ashley Young the score of the second goal finds Rooney the score of the
[4313.92 - 4318.24] P:1786.31 E:0.132234 |  third goal they're all calling for it. Rooney's ball to Nani on the edge of the area challenge
[4318.24 - 4322.96] P:1828.29 E:0.128109 |  came in from Troyori and now it's Rositski of Arsenal three-one to Manchester United.
[4323.52 - 4329.12] P:1784.72 E:0.127879 |  Arshavin and now Ramsey just held up by Jones on the halfway line now Cochalin the young French
[4329.12 - 4333.84] P:1684.50 E:0.127743 |  player gives the ball away no Arsenal have still got it but they're not progressing now Ramsey
[4333.84 - 4339.76] P:1826.57 E:0.124114 |  wants more Ramsey feeds Rositski three-one to Manchester United Pat Rice claps his hands down
[4339.76 - 4345.44] P:1605.37 E:0.126335 |  there in the technical area and Walcott takes over but there isn't great ambition here from Arsenal
[4345.44 - 4350.56] P:1755.35 E:0.136220 |  Troyori van Persie's in the area Rositski back to Walcott is playing on the left hand side at the
[4350.56 - 4356.56] P:1820.76 E:0.137486 |  moment square ball to Rositski van Persie's calling and it goes towards van Persie saved by De Haer
[4357.28 - 4362.40] P:1933.92 E:0.135813 |  at the near postal was no offside and van Persie could have scored yeah he could have scored
[4362.40 - 4366.08] P:1838.82 E:0.138318 |  and he hit it first time it's a very good save by De Haer but he could have actually had another
[4366.08 - 4370.56] P:1743.14 E:0.124705 |  touch mark and then put it from his right foot to his left I think that would have been three two.
[4371.28 - 4375.36] P:1827.74 E:0.144688 |  Arsenal fans still trying to get behind their team here three-one down they're still
[4375.36 - 4381.44] P:1777.63 E:0.130491 |  giving plenty of support away in the right corner there three-one though to Manchester United and
[4381.44 - 4387.28] P:1836.96 E:0.140666 |  now Rositski getting away at Ashubin getting away from Ebra Andrej Arvishan. Ashubin runs a long way
[4387.28 - 4392.56] P:1834.52 E:0.132505 |  with the ball United defend it van Persie chases across to the far side he's got two United players
[4392.56 - 4396.72] P:1851.11 E:0.133616 |  who's never going to get through there Ebra bringing the ball out now for Manchester
[4396.72 - 4401.36] P:1856.60 E:0.117208 |  Anderson bringing the ball out and cleverly now just got a bit sloppy Manchester United
[4402.08 - 4408.72] P:1834.74 E:0.121726 |  three-one to Manchester United as Kishelny steps in and cleverly's in the way still Arsenal
[4408.72 - 4412.64] P:1818.79 E:0.137191 |  they must score the next goal if they have any chance of getting back into the game as the move
[4412.64 - 4417.60] P:1847.89 E:0.133408 |  breaks down danger for Arsenal here as they push forward getting caught on the counter by people
[4417.60 - 4421.52] P:1878.89 E:0.131016 |  like Nani who's on the ball at the moment might feelings come out to try and urge his side to
[4421.52 - 4427.92] P:1817.43 E:0.120571 |  concentrate three-one they lead cleverly for Manchester United young available down the left
[4427.92 - 4433.44] P:1833.74 E:0.138689 |  hand side and it goes now short to Hernandez good noise around old Trafford at the moment
[4433.44 - 4439.44] P:1733.39 E:0.120670 |  as the balls played down the line to Hernandez over on the left hand side Hernandez up against
[4440.08 - 4446.24] P:1789.42 E:0.132826 |  Cockalan Ashley Young now takes over dribbling skills from him goes past Jenkinson fuzzled
[4446.24 - 4450.72] P:1861.26 E:0.140153 |  in with too much pace Rooney won't get that it's a throw in near side for Arsenal yeah a great ball
[4450.72 - 4455.12] P:1716.80 E:0.132608 |  you know you had to fire it in with pace because he got round the back of everybody and defendants
[4455.12 - 4459.28] P:1831.72 E:0.128725 |  starting to catch him up Rooney just couldn't quite get there nearly 10 minutes gone in the
[4459.28 - 4464.16] P:1717.18 E:0.133520 |  second half I'll remind you of the other scores a rare appearance right sorry yeah of arson
[4464.16 - 4470.08] P:1739.31 E:0.120023 |  venger on the train for the first time in the game and we played nearly 10 minutes of the second
[4470.08 - 4476.24] P:1801.47 E:0.117768 |  half he's down there alongside Pat Rice now having sat really and watched almost a resign look on his
[4476.24 - 4482.64] P:1674.44 E:0.111979 |  face in the first half and now Jenkinson for Arsenal into Aaron Ramsey is that the character
[4482.64 - 4486.88] P:1895.02 E:0.130925 |  in the arsenal side to get back is that the leadership from van Persie loses the ball to
[4486.88 - 4491.68] P:1868.35 E:0.136493 |  Smalling and with great long strides Smalling brings the ball and nobody comes towards him
[4491.68 - 4495.76] P:1815.29 E:0.127062 |  and Smalling's run a long way with it and he fired it straight at Theo Walcott and he'll have
[4495.76 - 4500.96] P:1806.13 E:0.133505 |  to get back inside his own half now as very crisply Ramsey sends Arshavin on his way Arshavin inside
[4500.96 - 4507.36] P:1875.61 E:0.119426 |  Jones still it Arshavin Arshavin shoots wide it's a corner though for Arsenal yeah and I think
[4507.44 - 4511.68] P:1807.59 E:0.138597 |  Jones he's just saying too small and you know you went forward which is fine and you gave the
[4511.68 - 4516.00] P:1696.35 E:0.129827 |  ball away somebody has to fill in for you and he's absolutely totally right which should have been
[4516.00 - 4522.16] P:1810.56 E:0.122118 |  nanny in that particular instance Arshavin should have done better earlier today Newcastle 2 full
[4522.16 - 4530.24] P:1830.50 E:0.135217 |  on 1 Spurs 1 Manchester City 5 with 4 from Jeco West from it Javier Niel Stoke City 1 those are all

[4560.00 - 4565.12] P:1647.50 E:0.112834 |  against Hibbs in fact I think there's another goal there here's Brian McLaughlin yeah maybe through
[4565.12 - 4569.84] P:1800.16 E:0.139441 |  the second half it's no Hartz 2 to Aberdeen Niel in Blacks corner in from the right hand side

[4582.96 - 4587.92] P:1708.10 E:0.134655 |  Youngster of course they signed from Southampton so he's coming into the game in a moment on the
[4587.92 - 4592.48] P:1782.26 E:0.136227 |  15 just getting fun that's why some Venga came out just to talk to him really so Oxlade Chamberlain
[4592.48 - 4596.72] P:1748.29 E:0.141362 |  is coming on soon for Arsenal they trail here by three goals to one the ball is with Van Persie
[4596.72 - 4600.96] P:1777.72 E:0.139013 |  there's nobody in the penalty area Van Persie's got it and he just plays it square into Cochalan
[4600.96 - 4606.96] P:1871.49 E:0.131984 |  and Cochalan was caught in possession by Hernandez but Cleverley has to give it back to his goalkeeper
[4606.96 - 4612.48] P:1816.58 E:0.125317 |  and De Haer's high clearance to the halfway line should be headed back by Juru he's decided to
[4612.48 - 4618.56] P:1775.06 E:0.130685 |  control it and then finds Ramsey Manchester United 3 Arsenal 1 that was the half-time score here
[4618.56 - 4623.44] P:1831.14 E:0.132351 |  it's Andrei Arshavin tried a little reverse pass towards Walcott and now smalling to bring the
[4623.44 - 4628.08] P:1764.44 E:0.129162 |  ball out for Manchester United gives it to Jones Arshen Venga jumps up and down John Cleese

[4634.32 - 4640.32] P:1798.11 E:0.110561 |  about to come on Manchester United building down the left hand side Young cuts in against
[4640.40 - 4644.00] P:1775.98 E:0.137502 |  Jenkins and Jenkins does well on this occasion though and the Manchester United players have
[4644.00 - 4650.64] P:1819.27 E:0.112200 |  to regroup in midfield Anderson holds it and finds Cleverley back again to Anderson all the

[4671.76 - 4676.88] P:1846.65 E:0.145153 |  though as Anderson finds Cleverley Cleverley looking for a one two for the Nandes should have scored
[4676.88 - 4681.28] P:1870.38 E:0.136440 |  it's it's straight in the goalkeeper Mike he did the really hard thing which was getting himself
[4681.28 - 4686.64] P:1856.85 E:0.135265 |  in the penalty area two yards of space and just and just passed the ball really to the goalkeeper
[4686.64 - 4691.28] P:1865.27 E:0.133517 |  just he says no more than anything just about another touch well all the goals so far in this
[4691.28 - 4695.68] P:1873.22 E:0.140634 |  game from English players that should have been another one from Cleverley as now Arshavin shoots

[4720.16 - 4725.12] P:1789.58 E:0.133841 |  gone in the second half you're listening to five live BBC World Service and Austin Venger
[4725.12 - 4729.52] P:1804.07 E:0.139876 |  suddenly now has become more animated down there as he looks to get Oxlade Chamberlain
[4729.52 - 4734.72] P:1740.03 E:0.124452 |  into the game it's interesting to see who he takes off he's had a little bit more from Arshavin
[4734.72 - 4740.56] P:1762.50 E:0.133272 |  in the second half mind you he needed to the ball is with Cleverley darts forward for Manchester United
[4740.56 - 4747.60] P:1740.96 E:0.125253 |  and finds Hernandez Hernandez gets away from his markers Jones into Anderson back again to Jones
[4747.60 - 4752.96] P:1790.09 E:0.125412 |  and now for Hernandez once more in a deep position early ball to the far side of the field neatly
[4752.96 - 4758.96] P:1757.18 E:0.123741 |  brought down by Evera Young goes on the outside Evera coming forward for Manchester United another
[4758.96 - 4764.56] P:1793.13 E:0.136379 |  goal and it really will be all over Hernandez linking up with Young and now Anderson comes in
[4764.56 - 4770.56] P:1804.08 E:0.136790 |  finds Rooney Rooney to Nani lots of passes is there anything here at the end of it as Nani now
[4770.56 - 4777.12] P:1828.16 E:0.134872 |  takes on triory Nani's ball in away by Juru and the clearance complete by Ramsey but Jones meets it
[4777.12 - 4782.80] P:1711.10 E:0.120881 |  with a firm header Arsenal can't get out of their own half Evera's there once more tracking back on
[4782.80 - 4789.04] P:1864.50 E:0.130162 |  the half wayline and Evans finds Jones great piece of skill by Nani the way tricked to triory wasn't it
[4789.04 - 4795.84] P:1860.96 E:0.137369 |  Jones coming forward and then overrunning it as triory clears very weakly to Smalling Smalling
[4795.84 - 4800.32] P:1716.57 E:0.138550 |  and Jones whenever they can love to come out of their own half Nani now a run from Hernandez
[4800.32 - 4805.04] P:1788.53 E:0.134461 |  diverts a couple of Arsenal players Rooney now oh great ball from Rooney to release Hernandez
[4805.04 - 4811.36] P:1787.58 E:0.137066 |  early ball will find Young Hernandez though decides to chip and hangs it high and easy for the goalkeeper
[4811.92 - 4817.92] P:1776.40 E:0.129201 |  Nani did the exact same thing in the exact same position when Rooney again on this occasion
[4817.92 - 4822.48] P:1764.48 E:0.140073 |  pulled away to the far post completely on March Anderson for Manchester United leading by three
[4822.48 - 4826.88] P:1937.07 E:0.135205 |  goals to one and they've grown again in the last few minutes Manchester United Anderson again in
[4826.88 - 4832.16] P:1827.04 E:0.148415 |  the move Anderson on to Ashley Young Young shot saved by the keeper comes back to Young Nani should
[4832.16 - 4838.00] P:1840.35 E:0.147427 |  have got it in he was inside the six yard area and didn't get anything on the ball at all Arsenal
[4838.08 - 4843.20] P:1825.01 E:0.137504 |  still haven't cleared it's Wayne Rooney of Manchester United three one they lead into Hernandez on
[4843.20 - 4848.72] P:1797.05 E:0.135984 |  the edge of the area squirted forward by Hernandez and an offside is given Hernandez even then can't
[4848.72 - 4852.48] P:1775.50 E:0.128581 |  put the ball in the back of the net and it's a free kick to Arsenal now they can make the change
[4852.48 - 4858.40] P:1810.80 E:0.123374 |  yeah I think in the end first saved by Shezny but when the ball came to Nani it's almost though he
[4858.40 - 4863.52] P:1849.18 E:0.132477 |  stood on it didn't he was it was a Zoe's reaction surprised that the ball came to him it's a fantastic
[4863.52 - 4867.84] P:1676.45 E:0.130830 |  position to score well they've let them off the hook a bit in the second half Manchester United
[4867.84 - 4873.84] P:1745.69 E:0.121573 |  and it looks it cock a land I think coming yeah it is yeah so cock a land comes off and Alex Oxley
[4873.84 - 4879.92] P:1738.14 E:0.113940 |  Chamberlain makes his way where to the far side I think maybe this means Walcott down the centre
[4879.92 - 4883.84] P:1522.82 E:0.130658 |  does it know at the moment Walcott's going to play on the left so perhaps Arshivan's going to go in
[4883.84 - 4890.24] P:1797.77 E:0.121444 |  behind van Persing yeah so Oxley Chamberlain on down that right far side three one to Manchester
[4890.24 - 4895.92] P:1714.41 E:0.115705 |  United all the goals in the first half and now it's Cleverley the hard-working midfielder
[4895.92 - 4901.28] P:1781.99 E:0.145148 |  into Rooney lovely return Cleverley now onto Hernandez back comes the defender and Koshelny
[4901.28 - 4905.28] P:1832.73 E:0.137111 |  did really well there had to get that right otherwise it would have been a penalty if he'd
[4905.28 - 4910.64] P:1795.89 E:0.126523 |  brought that uh ascending off if he brought him down he was the last defender uh Arsenal lose
[4910.64 - 4916.96] P:1723.23 E:0.121511 |  their way completely and the ball now is collected by Dehaer so Walcott's in the position now where
[4916.96 - 4921.52] P:1715.46 E:0.143895 |  he scored of course for them in midweek in Italy against Duneze on the left hand side scored
[4921.52 - 4928.40] P:1739.99 E:0.134158 |  in the last three games hasn't he yeah and a throw out by Dehaer who had a very mixed first half
[4929.36 - 4933.44] P:1667.44 E:0.141030 |  saved a penalty let one in easily right at the end of the first half from Walcott
[4934.16 - 4938.32] P:1723.10 E:0.152188 |  Nani now Nani great ball to Rooney let's it run on to Hernandez and then as Rooney went for the
[4938.32 - 4944.48] P:1834.37 E:0.142737 |  return he was caught by Zuru and it's a free kick to Manchester United and a yellow car for Zuru
[4944.48 - 4949.92] P:1813.92 E:0.133453 |  yeah I'm not sure whether the referee actually saw that I think he reacted to the crowd as much as
[4950.00 - 4955.36] P:1736.76 E:0.127809 |  anything and he's and he's given a yellow in fairness to Howard Webb Zuru's not made
[4956.96 - 4961.12] P:1768.58 E:0.134421 |  a moan about it whatsoever he definitely had his hand on his back Zuru on Rooney's back
[4964.24 - 4971.04] P:1813.21 E:0.141978 |  well Rooney's already scored with one free kick this one is to the right as we look at it it's
[4971.76 - 4976.80] P:1763.89 E:0.142427 |  three yards maybe outside the penalty area Nani and Ashley Young in conversation with Rooney
[4977.76 - 4983.20] P:1773.87 E:0.124187 |  Duheshne in the Arsenal goal away to our right United score now and it really is game over
[4983.20 - 4988.40] P:1751.51 E:0.130055 |  Manchester United three Arsenal one on five live and well service 18 and a half minutes gone in the
[4988.40 - 4994.80] P:1804.38 E:0.112025 |  second half and deep in conversation and thought Rooney Young and now they're trying to distract the
[4994.80 - 5001.04] P:1836.52 E:0.136818 |  Arsenal defenders by wanting them back another yard or so it's touch to Rooney and Rooney scores
[5001.04 - 5006.40] P:1837.21 E:0.151456 |  for the second time from a free kick Rooney to Young and then a little carler from Wayne Rooney
[5006.48 - 5010.96] P:1779.97 E:0.141119 |  finds the back of the net for the second time in this game and wraps it up here at Old Trafford
[5010.96 - 5016.32] P:1858.34 E:0.140840 |  Manchester United four Arsenal one Mike I'm not sure because you're concentrating on the
[5016.32 - 5021.76] P:1818.64 E:0.146340 |  take of the free kick which was Rooney whether you saw the goalkeeper he gambled he thought once
[5021.76 - 5026.40] P:1707.27 E:0.148406 |  the ball came back to Rooney he was going to stick it in the top right and corner as we look and
[5026.40 - 5031.20] P:1837.04 E:0.138466 |  Rooney just very cleverly just dinked it over the other side and I won't say it trickled him but
[5031.20 - 5034.64] P:1776.82 E:0.145478 |  it just went in really really easily the goalkeeper completely hoodwinked
[5036.88 - 5042.64] P:1755.26 E:0.125380 |  well he's in very good nick at the moment isn't he Rooney very good nick which is good news
[5042.64 - 5049.28] P:1714.09 E:0.138848 |  with Fabio Capella and England a way to Bulgaria on Friday night you'll hear that on five live
[5049.28 - 5055.36] P:1709.43 E:0.137554 |  Manchester United four Arsenal one and to be honest there could have been many more goals as well
[5055.36 - 5060.08] P:1651.07 E:0.132101 |  for Manchester United here today if the final ball had been a little more convincing at times
[5060.64 - 5066.96] P:1850.86 E:0.120199 |  so four one they lead and it's all up now for Arsenal four one to Manchester United five one
[5067.76 - 5075.60] P:1773.40 E:0.125710 |  to Manchester City against Spurs north London one and truly drugged today by the city of Manchester
[5075.60 - 5084.48] P:1739.88 E:0.137920 |  nine two at the moment on aggregate and it's not all over here yet great noise around Old Trafford
[5084.48 - 5092.64] P:1744.55 E:0.141263 |  20 minutes gone in the second half and the thing was Mark even before Rooney made it absolutely sure
[5093.84 - 5096.88] P:1748.18 E:0.147400 |  there weren't really convincing signs that Arsenal were going to turn this around
[5096.88 - 5101.68] P:1799.00 E:0.130355 |  no they'd had a little bit of the ball and our shaving our shaving had a chance but apart from
[5101.68 - 5106.72] P:1762.56 E:0.118065 |  that they saved from Dehaire from Van Persie which was good but no United look like it could score
[5106.72 - 5111.20] P:1714.23 E:0.131722 |  at any time and our arson vengour has sat down now as the corner kick is taken for his team and it's
[5111.20 - 5117.60] P:1781.26 E:0.115204 |  a good jump and header away by Chris Smalling Rosicki very half-hearted from him in the first half
[5117.60 - 5122.00] P:1766.74 E:0.122041 |  and now it's Van Persie down the right hand side looking for a one two we're going to have changes
[5122.00 - 5128.64] P:1770.70 E:0.118328 |  here now Park is coming on in a moment for Manchester United it's a sort of game this United Arsenal
[5128.64 - 5132.72] P:1745.51 E:0.127259 |  that normally Park would start but of course he's coming back from injury he got the only
[5132.72 - 5136.80] P:1847.59 E:0.127993 |  goal in the Premier League game here between these two sides before Christmas last season
[5136.80 - 5141.84] P:1868.21 E:0.145052 |  and now what a great ball from Ashley Young from left to right to Smalling and Jones is galloping
[5141.84 - 5147.44] P:1882.43 E:0.131654 |  on the outside of Smalling Smalling gets a little bit tangled up but now he finds Wayne Rooney
[5147.44 - 5153.92] P:1867.84 E:0.149097 |  Jones calls for it he goes to Nani he should be 5-1 and Nani just slots it distinctly over the line
[5153.92 - 5161.28] P:1813.23 E:0.144917 |  to make it 5-1 to Manchester United it was 5-1 to Manchester City against Spurs here it's 5-1
[5161.92 - 5168.80] P:1844.68 E:0.148251 |  to Manchester United against the other half of North London Arsenal and Nani's goal is celebrated
[5168.80 - 5174.40] P:1870.12 E:0.134428 |  by All-In-Sundry here and it's a thumping home win I tell you what Mike I've watched that goal on
[5174.40 - 5179.76] P:1857.93 E:0.137170 |  match of the day two tonight started by Manchester United's corner flag and they just played the ball
[5179.76 - 5185.68] P:1801.19 E:0.129427 |  out and a great change of play ball from Young and in the end the ball threw to Nani I think it
[5185.68 - 5191.12] P:1739.12 E:0.145220 |  came from Rooney and he just dinked it over she says and he just committed himself absolutely brilliant
[5194.16 - 5198.24] P:1753.10 E:0.152274 |  well now they're going to really take the foot off the gas here Manchester United by making two
[5198.24 - 5204.24] P:1725.49 E:0.148917 |  changes and bringing on two players who started the Champions League final Ryan Giggs and Park
[5204.24 - 5209.60] P:1815.16 E:0.145456 |  that was Nani's last kick of the ball in this game he's been replaced by Giggs Anderson's going
[5209.60 - 5214.88] P:1779.55 E:0.154550 |  off as well we are at the halfway point at this and the other thing Mark just before we go to Alan
[5215.44 - 5219.52] P:1877.48 E:0.148726 |  in the build-up to that game we had both Jones and Smalling as well breaking out of defence
[5219.52 - 5225.60] P:1973.45 E:0.134757 |  in his options to attack so who's to say that's the end of the scoring yet still a corner of the
[5225.60 - 5232.16] P:1850.71 E:0.127303 |  game to go it's Manchester United 5 Arsenal 1 and here's Alan Green and I feel quite sorry for Sir
[5232.16 - 5238.32] P:1632.69 E:0.123871 |  Chesney who's made some outstanding saves for Arsenal and hasn't had a prayer with any of the
[5238.32 - 5244.80] P:1747.99 E:0.121348 |  goals that have gone past him I think Mike's right the scoring isn't finished Manchester United
[5245.04 - 5252.00] P:1642.18 E:0.130318 |  5 Arsenal 1 listen to 5 live at the BBC covers in the Barclays Premier League
[5252.64 - 5260.08] P:1656.28 E:0.117417 |  and too many of those Arsenal players out there aren't cutting it Rositski or Chavin van Persie
[5260.72 - 5270.08] P:1641.53 E:0.102545 |  and I have to say too Wolcott not done a lot here's Rositski to Ramsey Ramsey onto Jenkinson
[5270.08 - 5278.16] P:1662.28 E:0.115800 |  on the far side Jenkinson into Oxlade Chamberlain Jenkinson once more and now Ramsey still at 22
[5278.16 - 5284.64] P:1510.52 E:0.122650 |  minutes left for player remember here at Old Trafford van Persie to Wolcott left side for Arsenal
[5284.64 - 5289.68] P:1571.33 E:0.124443 |  level to the edge of the United Penalty here just dink the ball in carelessly hoping to find van
[5289.68 - 5295.28] P:1722.67 E:0.127188 |  Persie find a red shirt instead and here's Wayne Rooney who scored two sumptuous free kicks plays
[5295.28 - 5300.72] P:1631.76 E:0.126439 |  at Fulton Hernandez who's on side good anticipation by Sir Chesney well out of his penalty area to
[5300.72 - 5309.20] P:1738.17 E:0.103016 |  make the clearance gigs from Manchester United and to Rooney gigs again back to Jones Alan there
[5309.20 - 5315.60] P:1782.95 E:0.119009 |  are too many Arsenal players when they lose a ball he wants it not bothered here's Park right
[5315.60 - 5322.08] P:1766.83 E:0.133279 |  side Park just checks inside Traore finds Rooney 25 yards out tries to chip to Chesney hit the post
[5322.32 - 5328.96] P:1774.55 E:0.134417 |  goalkeeper beating so close to a hat trick we've been absolutely brilliant on it brilliant
[5331.12 - 5339.60] P:1707.83 E:0.119784 |  I think the overwhelming supporters inside Old Trafford are enjoying this apart from the
[5339.60 - 5345.20] P:1573.26 E:0.100749 |  Arsenal bunch unfortunately we made a great racket early in the second half not that they
[5345.20 - 5350.40] P:1826.62 E:0.118800 |  expected a comeback from their team but just trying to show their support here's Jones from
[5350.40 - 5355.76] P:1682.36 E:0.126373 |  Manchester United 20 minutes left for play here on to Park steps away from Juru finds
[5355.76 - 5361.04] P:1796.55 E:0.130737 |  young in the penalty area Hernandez waits back at go to Park on his left foot six one
[5365.12 - 5372.32] P:1843.50 E:0.143176 |  come back for the record books how easy was that how easy absolutely no pressure on any
[5372.32 - 5378.40] P:1848.54 E:0.141505 |  Manchester United player on the ball and you know what I say the Arsenal players are walking down
[5378.40 - 5383.44] P:1840.23 E:0.144704 |  so very very despondent Alan there's probably only four or five of them we've had a real go
[5383.44 - 5388.64] P:1775.97 E:0.143333 |  today they've come here they've been missing 11 players but they've also come here with half a
[5388.64 - 5395.20] P:1801.63 E:0.129803 |  team if they've been disgraced for one or two of them I mean van Persie is going around talking to
[5395.84 - 5403.44] P:1727.74 E:0.124988 |  the various players at the moment but if he had a hand mirror he could look at it as to his own display
[5404.08 - 5411.12] P:1771.32 E:0.128375 |  but United have been really good as well they've been rampant but uh and the quality of the
[5411.12 - 5414.48] P:1690.73 E:0.139527 |  goals as well as the exit but talk about contribute to your own downfall
[5416.48 - 5424.80] P:1679.13 E:0.132819 |  sixth one how many more are shavin to Ramsey in the centre circle and Ramsey moves forward
[5424.80 - 5429.76] P:1645.67 E:0.116970 |  the Vades Park plays it back to Rezitzky van Persie with movement up front
[5429.76 - 5433.92] P:1636.45 E:0.130268 |  ball goes towards shavin back to Rezitzky in the van Persie edge of the penalty
[5433.92 - 5439.60] P:1646.33 E:0.110583 |  tries to back heel it to Walcott didn't come off and it's cleared by Evra Jankensen to Oxley
[5439.60 - 5444.56] P:1663.11 E:0.119167 |  Chamberlain on the far side of the field back to Jenkins Jankensen into our shavin a yard
[5444.56 - 5449.36] P:1617.43 E:0.117120 |  outside the penalty now Ramsey's shot takes an affliction off of defender behind for a corner
[5449.36 - 5452.72] P:1732.52 E:0.136185 |  yeah Ramsey's one of the few Arsenal players actually kept going one of the very few
[5453.68 - 5456.00] P:1722.84 E:0.110114 |  and to Chesney yeah
[5458.16 - 5461.68] P:1574.43 E:0.144242 |  yeah I know I know a conceding six goal but actually played quite well mom
[5464.16 - 5466.08] P:1662.47 E:0.150947 |  he did he has
[5468.48 - 5474.88] P:1662.29 E:0.129166 |  corner the strat for then to Arsenal swung in left but he and Kishelny's header is wide
[5475.44 - 5480.40] P:1691.62 E:0.128002 |  relatively free header Jones jumped too early yeah sure actually at least hit the target Kishelny
[5481.36 - 5487.52] P:1624.22 E:0.115207 |  not good not good from an Arsenal perspective and he's got what many now one two three days
[5487.52 - 5493.36] P:1740.86 E:0.120036 |  of the transfer window and well you're not exactly inexplicable yeah if he doesn't make some
[5494.00 - 5498.56] P:1743.19 E:0.115509 |  substantial purchases Benger and not exactly looking at attractive outfit to come and play for

[5760.96 - 5767.52] P:1772.67 E:0.117561 |  that Hernandez might have been just offside obviously not given there's also Mengus shaking his head

[6152.16 - 6158.96] P:1632.98 E:0.126066 |  well Arsenal I've had the Mickey taken out of them today and it's hard to find any positives
[6158.96 - 6161.52] P:1693.80 E:0.130838 |  they're going to bring on two substitutes now
[6162.88 - 6163.36] P:1650.57 E:0.177244 |  Shamak
[6165.20 - 6170.32] P:1662.57 E:0.137666 |  how low has he sunk if he's only being brought on as a striker with seven minutes to go
[6170.32 - 6179.28] P:1651.44 E:0.125159 |  and land landsbreak two final changes van Persie is being replaced and so too is Walcott
[6183.76 - 6188.08] P:1565.58 E:0.143979 |  Walcott remembers to applaud the Arsenal fans some of which have already made their way
[6189.12 - 6196.48] P:1566.09 E:0.101472 |  out of Old Trafford so van Persie's day is over so too is the Walcott's and
[6197.44 - 6201.92] P:1603.35 E:0.113559 |  do you recover or how long does it take to recover from a defeat like this
[6201.92 - 6207.76] P:1724.21 E:0.131070 |  well you know the R11 players I know it's just three points yeah and the R11 players out so it
[6207.76 - 6212.40] P:1584.39 E:0.121967 |  depends on how quickly you can get the majority of those players back you know we keep saying
[6212.40 - 6216.40] P:1621.40 E:0.143418 |  they needed players before they even sold Nazary and Fabrikas
[6218.48 - 6222.72] P:1632.23 E:0.116570 |  so the question needs posing how much responsibility does Arsene Vengerhaven have for that
[6222.72 - 6225.36] P:1498.49 E:0.128565 |  he has a lot he has to have a lot of responsibility Alan
[6225.92 - 6230.80] P:1571.04 E:0.123651 |  and Graham Taylor I don't know if you've heard Graham but Graham said about the the soft muscle
[6230.80 - 6238.32] P:1667.32 E:0.104829 |  injuries that are suffered by Arsenal players yeah well too many of them I think the ground's
[6238.32 - 6245.84] P:1605.88 E:0.102205 |  got a lot to do with that though smally to gigs gigs right at the center circle to runny who's
[6245.84 - 6252.56] P:1701.58 E:0.108826 |  got his hat trick remember now back to cleverly gigs gigs flicked forward offside flag against

[6262.48 - 6267.92] P:1527.97 E:0.119228 |  even think of one and I think Ramsey played yeah and the goalkeeper the goalkeeper and
[6267.92 - 6273.44] P:1627.18 E:0.102207 |  cockle over for his substitution and Sagesney faultless for the seven goals that have gone past
[6273.44 - 6280.32] P:1670.12 E:0.093514 |  him faultless the fact there's more reason to criticize the hair than there is Sagesney yeah
[6281.60 - 6287.20] P:1580.01 E:0.126321 |  Ramsey onto Chammak Chammak lost the ball far too easily was giving it back and lost it again
[6288.32 - 6292.24] P:1602.26 E:0.148360 |  he looked good when he first came in to the Premier League it's not just losing the ball
[6292.24 - 6297.36] P:1665.86 E:0.124366 |  Alan it's then not breaking into at least a jog he's that he's sort of trotting around the
[6297.36 - 6302.40] P:1579.11 E:0.117365 |  center circle and Bismol actually young from Manchester United on the far side of the field
[6302.40 - 6307.44] P:1555.50 E:0.119511 |  into Rudy yard outside the penalty here his cross wasn't great headed away and uh
[6308.16 - 6314.16] P:1592.03 E:0.104153 |  now Arsenal can counterattack if that's the right phrase uh for a situation facing them
[6314.16 - 6323.36] P:1612.58 E:0.098271 |  trailing by seven goals to do here at Manchester United or Chavin onto Ramsey Ramsey with
[6323.36 - 6327.68] P:1748.26 E:0.127694 |  Lansbury do his right cuts in onto his left foot second time under his left foot and should
[6327.68 - 6332.40] P:1726.23 E:0.122541 |  score was just right oh it was as well and a hair was flat footed he's almost sort of

[6839.12 - 6844.56] P:1635.37 E:0.155902 |  to reflect and digest what we've seen today 19 goals in four Barclays Premier League games here
[6844.64 - 6850.80] P:1699.38 E:0.131761 |  today's results Manchester United eight Arsenal two if it came up on the video printer it would

[6880.48 - 6885.76] P:1535.08 E:0.137709 |  out of nine goal difference plus nine goals scored 12 so that's an average of four a game you'd think
[6885.76 - 6890.00] P:1462.97 E:0.140023 |  they'd be top it would have been absolutely identical but for that last goal man United

[6923.68 - 6929.28] P:1798.44 E:0.128260 |  the ball away failing to miss chances giving chances to the opposition but really when you lose
[6929.28 - 6936.08] P:1775.83 E:0.117506 |  the ball and you you're not even got the inclination to run back and make a challenge I think it says

[7029.52 - 7034.08] P:1818.49 E:0.126136 |  two-horse race or is it far too early no no it's far far far too early chart chelsea haven't
