[0.00 - 6.50] P:1835.86 E:0.126670 |  Well, thanks Kali, yes, thousands and thousands of those Liverpool supporters have got here
[6.50 - 12.34] P:1782.23 E:0.137382 |  to Kiev by hook or by crook and they have brought hundreds of flags and banners that
[12.34 - 18.18] P:1665.28 E:0.150869 |  are dragged all over the Olympic Stadium here. The Real Madrid fans in white and purple created
[18.18 - 26.86] P:1626.71 E:0.144846 |  a mosaic to our right. Hasta el final, Vamos Real was the message from them. This referee
[26.88 - 32.94] P:1816.59 E:0.140327 |  is from Serbia, Milorad Mazic, who is just going through his pre-match routine in the
[32.94 - 38.38] P:1684.87 E:0.144011 |  centre circle. The teams to repeat are as follows, Real Madrid with Kilo Navas in goal,
[38.38 - 44.52] P:1720.75 E:0.141061 |  Kavahal Varan, Ramos and Marcello at the back, Kasimiro, Modric Kros and then Isko behind
[44.52 - 50.30] P:1627.87 E:0.155623 |  Benzema and Ronaldo and Liverpool with Karius, Alexander Arnold, Lovren van Dijk and Robertson,
[50.32 - 58.02] P:1699.80 E:0.144113 |  Henderson, Vinaldo Manilna, Salah, Firmino and Mane. So this is the 2018 Champions League
[58.02 - 62.42] P:1856.92 E:0.140763 |  final and it begins with Liverpool kicking off and playing the ball back into central
[62.42 - 67.54] P:1885.29 E:0.122575 |  defence. Liverpool in the all red kit with the white trim pumped forward towards the
[67.54 - 73.54] P:1957.96 E:0.131967 |  edge of the Real Madrid penalty area and Real Madrid who are all in white. The five European
[73.54 - 78.14] P:1800.95 E:0.131536 |  cup finals that Liverpool have won have all been against teams playing in white. Salah
[78.38 - 81.78] P:1724.72 E:0.144202 |  playing the ball through into the penalty area and an important touch from Varan who came
[81.78 - 87.66] P:1810.96 E:0.146636 |  across in front of Mane in the penalty area, got his toe to it. And the first contribution
[87.66 - 94.66] P:1853.58 E:0.131041 |  from Cristiano Ronaldo on the half way line is a buffeting from Dejan Lovren. Right on
[94.66 - 100.54] P:1881.35 E:0.122541 |  the half way line Ronaldo was knocked off the field, went down clutching his back but
[100.54 - 105.78] P:1974.96 E:0.140615 |  he's on his feet. So this is five live BBC Radio, Merseyside are with us as well for
[105.82 - 110.10] P:2025.15 E:0.139257 |  the commentary this evening so welcome to those listeners and with us in the commentary box
[110.10 - 114.54] P:2007.47 E:0.135877 |  Chris Waddle who's played in the final of this competition and Mark Lawrenceon who's
[114.54 - 118.82] P:1897.28 E:0.137713 |  won it with Liverpool. Get a word from them in a moment but Real Madrid who in this first
[118.82 - 123.30] P:1798.06 E:0.137873 |  half will be playing from right to left. Here is Cristiano Ronaldo with a little flick
[123.30 - 128.26] P:1849.48 E:0.130865 |  and then Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a huge cheer for his first touch in the Champions
[128.26 - 132.66] P:1750.90 E:0.133738 |  League final which is to whack the ball down field to the other end to Navas. Right start
[132.66 - 137.94] P:1829.66 E:0.137167 |  with Liverpool rolled it back, quick and long, high pressure on Real Madrid both horses
[137.94 - 143.42] P:1798.82 E:0.139420 |  suddenly just cleared away and as you say Lovren from Cinti Ronaldo welcome to the game but
[143.42 - 150.90] P:1848.03 E:0.123734 |  you can see Real Madrid do not panic, look at the play the way out. Real Madrid nil, Liverpool
[150.90 - 157.22] P:1842.67 E:0.125709 |  nil and here's Marcelo on the half way line. Real Madrid bidding to win this competition
[157.22 - 162.46] P:1884.50 E:0.134564 |  for the third season in a row that's not been done since the 70s. Here's Ronaldo on the
[163.26 - 167.90] P:1874.42 E:0.128418 |  left-hand side Ronaldo plays the ball to the edge of the area, Modric slightly behind him
[167.90 - 171.34] P:1844.34 E:0.150774 |  now the ball to the right-hand side which is chipped in towards Isco but the offside
[171.34 - 177.66] P:1862.14 E:0.139530 |  flag is up and in any case Carrius was out smartly. Carrius did really well John he starts
[177.66 - 182.86] P:1750.81 E:0.137222 |  in position he was out very very quickly. Carvajal with the cross looking for Isco
[182.86 - 186.38] P:1706.29 E:0.137459 |  through the middle. Right move Ronaldo and he fancies his chances on his left-hand side
[186.38 - 191.10] P:1658.55 E:0.145585 |  doesn't he very well a talent he is we know that but he's really come really quite wide
[191.10 - 195.26] P:1672.35 E:0.151647 |  he normally plays a lot now and what we saw you did talk about that Chris didn't you whether
[195.26 - 201.98] P:1657.75 E:0.149662 |  Ronaldo would play in a wide position or whether he would be tucked in but clearly they are
[201.98 - 207.34] P:1799.53 E:0.141701 |  looking to exploit the 19 year old Alexander Arnall but Liverpool coming forward with their
[207.34 - 212.46] P:1844.88 E:0.134768 |  front line Salah now back towards Vainal de Mejerci shot which is blocked on the edge of the penalty
[212.46 - 217.90] P:1784.36 E:0.150830 |  area and Veran is able to turn and clear it away downfield. Many of those banners are mentioned
[218.54 - 225.10] P:1804.09 E:0.123179 |  and referenced the fact that we're watching European Royal Key here tonight. Real Madrid
[225.10 - 231.58] P:1901.94 E:0.151938 |  who have the best record in European club competitions. Winners of the European Cup
[231.58 - 238.14] P:1926.80 E:0.144960 |  or the Champions League 12 times over the years and Liverpool the most successful British club
[238.14 - 242.70] P:1908.45 E:0.138188 |  in European competitions. He has fun date with a pass down the left-hand side but it's beyond
[242.70 - 247.50] P:1736.40 E:0.126075 |  Robertson and bounces out of play for a throw. I think if Liverpool was ready to keep pushing
[247.50 - 251.26] P:1821.94 E:0.143115 |  the full box on and make a run when they're getting good possession they will get in because
[251.26 - 256.06] P:1727.88 E:0.123027 |  it's a way men will not chuck them. Liverpool win the ball back on the left-hand side and
[257.02 - 261.18] P:1690.92 E:0.144556 |  it's played away by Carvajal towards the edge of the penalty area but the pitch was a little
[261.18 - 267.42] P:1809.69 E:0.138444 |  heavy there from Casamiro and now here is Salah 44 goal more Salah. Tarleks and Arnall who swings
[267.42 - 271.58] P:1791.08 E:0.154208 |  the low cross in towards the edge of the penalty area and Veran is able to come across. Great ball in
[273.42 - 277.42] P:1786.02 E:0.141144 |  Alexander Arnall never even thought about just delivering it with pace had to be dealt with
[277.66 - 282.22] P:1651.19 E:0.123380 |  takes the throw Alexander Arnall flicked on by Vinaldo but cleared away by Real Madrid
[282.22 - 285.66] P:1488.21 E:0.149846 |  on the edge of the penalty area. Can you see John already Real Madrid I'm not worried about going
[285.66 - 289.66] P:1496.01 E:0.135497 |  pressing the ball high look there everyone's in their own half they're saying yeah go on you can
[289.66 - 296.54] P:1885.44 E:0.125709 |  have the ball we're going to cut you on the break. Long pass from Van Dijk but it's headed down on the
[296.54 - 302.06] P:1733.88 E:0.144000 |  edge of the area by Sergio Ramos the Real Madrid captain now up towards Cristiano Ronaldo who over
[302.06 - 307.10] P:1805.42 E:0.152948 |  ran it trains he was fouled referee Mazic says no Liverpool with Salah more Salah in with a challenge
[307.18 - 312.54] P:1865.01 E:0.146617 |  on Salah that looked like a foul and it is giving Liverpool's way I think Ronaldo's going to have a
[312.54 - 316.62] P:1732.69 E:0.138629 |  word with their referee as well you're not allowed to tackle him don't forget well he overran the
[316.62 - 321.34] P:1630.36 E:0.138981 |  ball he lost control there wasn't a foul and that was a foul definitely more cello there a bit slow
[323.50 - 328.14] P:1716.61 E:0.153970 |  so BBC Radio Merseyside are with us the World's Servers are with us as well to welcome to everyone
[328.14 - 333.74] P:1700.72 E:0.142996 |  who's listening around the world to this truly global event even if it is in inverted commas the
[333.74 - 340.30] P:1671.51 E:0.135511 |  European Cup final and of course two listeners on five live free kick to Liverpool it's nil nil we've
[340.30 - 345.74] P:1619.16 E:0.145075 |  played almost five minutes James Milner is waiting over the ball Salah is there as well
[346.62 - 352.62] P:1717.82 E:0.134137 |  we're not quite got things ready yet because the two-man Real Madrid wall Modric is one of them
[353.18 - 359.82] P:1767.75 E:0.141821 |  and um is putting his hand over his mouth where he speaks to referee Mazic so we're ready for the
[359.82 - 365.10] P:1681.76 E:0.153384 |  free kick near the right corner of the box is Liverpool player Milner holds his left arm in the
[365.10 - 370.30] P:1894.16 E:0.140903 |  air Salah comes up runs over the ball Milner delivers it square towards Salah who shoots but it was
[370.30 - 375.02] P:1839.15 E:0.132936 |  charged down by Modric who was one of the members in the wall threw himself in front of the shot from
[375.02 - 379.42] P:1695.79 E:0.132847 |  Salah and blocked it actually back into the Liverpool half where Alexander-Arnold's clearance was
[379.42 - 385.50] P:1798.06 E:0.124420 |  very nearly closed down by Isco but it was that Carrier's fortunately was positioned perfectly
[385.50 - 392.06] P:1633.44 E:0.134481 |  to be able to calmly play the ball away and the ball is kept in over on the far side the Real Madrid
[392.06 - 396.54] P:1703.70 E:0.139603 |  right but it's pulled down now towards the edge of the penalty area but the the covering challenge
[396.54 - 403.74] P:1901.79 E:0.134710 |  came in and so Tony Cross the German who is able to run the ball out towards the left hand side
[403.74 - 409.58] P:1878.76 E:0.139762 |  and eventually it finds its way back to Marcelo on the edge of his own penalty area so Real Madrid
[409.58 - 417.10] P:1984.34 E:0.136428 |  in possession and here's Sergio Ramos who has scored in two Champions League finals memorably
[417.10 - 423.90] P:1923.81 E:0.136395 |  against Atlético Madrid in Lisbon Sergio Ramos so much experience in this side it is exactly the
[423.90 - 431.82] P:1878.14 E:0.128239 |  same Real Madrid team that started the match in Cardiff a year ago and actually there are five
[432.46 - 438.86] P:1839.37 E:0.129771 |  of this Real Madrid team that have started all four of these recent European Cup Champions League
[438.86 - 444.94] P:1723.41 E:0.134648 |  finals for Real Madrid Ronaldo couldn't keep the ball couldn't bring it down so Milner finds the
[444.94 - 450.78] P:1802.25 E:0.143656 |  ball to Firmino who passes it through but Veran crucially just got there ahead of Mane just outside
[450.78 - 457.90] P:1867.95 E:0.147526 |  the D. Wow also Navas what was Navas doing he was in no man's land goalkeeper sprinted out crucially
[457.90 - 464.22] P:1789.25 E:0.128118 |  though Veran got the touch and was able to tackle Mane so Liverpool with Vain Alden out towards the
[464.22 - 469.18] P:1769.00 E:0.130137 |  left hand side Robertson is there the Scottish left back now back to Vain Alden again middle of the
[469.18 - 475.10] P:1801.94 E:0.127195 |  Real Madrid half and he clips a very high pass out to Alexander-Arnold on the right hand side
[475.10 - 478.54] P:1873.28 E:0.133457 |  he's able to take it down a little ball he's looking for one two gives it to Salado Salado
[478.54 - 483.10] P:1847.24 E:0.141260 |  looks for goal bounces into the area Alexander-Arnold's on to it but Navas is able to come out and
[483.10 - 487.10] P:1899.65 E:0.145195 |  smother the ball brilliant at the feet of the teenage fullback very bold he's got to say Liverpool
[487.10 - 491.74] P:1732.89 E:0.130945 |  scored a very positive there right tempo moving the ball very quick Real Madrid are absolutely
[491.74 - 496.62] P:1757.04 E:0.134961 |  terrified to come at least well not even gone the other centre circle they don't they want to get
[496.62 - 500.38] P:1731.26 E:0.139780 |  in 30 yards on the goal they don't want to come any higher the playing little place he made up for
[500.38 - 507.58] P:1795.15 E:0.129612 |  his earlier indecision there Kailor Navas by Lawrence very very very brave and Liverpool were very nearly
[507.58 - 515.90] P:1741.07 E:0.126435 |  in Kailor Navas the Costa Rican World Cup goalkeeper he has Milner Liverpool has started quite well
[515.90 - 519.90] P:1856.14 E:0.149822 |  he has Henderson Henderson kicks the ball out towards the left hand side to Robertson
[520.54 - 525.50] P:1762.85 E:0.135921 |  and you can hear the reaction from those thousands of Liverpool supporters in the end to our left
[525.50 - 530.46] P:1795.20 E:0.134155 |  Vijn Alder middle of a Real Madrid half chips the ball Robertson's in space on the right hand side
[530.46 - 537.18] P:1844.23 E:0.136269 |  so Carvajal goes out there but the cross comes in towards Firmino who's leaning forward and couldn't
[537.18 - 540.94] P:1722.73 E:0.139707 |  glance it on as he enjoyed it to do a lot of joy with the fullbacks aren't they they're not going
[540.94 - 545.50] P:1705.55 E:0.139426 |  to track back Ronaldo's not Modric doesn't really want to go out there now that he wants to play narrow
[545.50 - 549.02] P:1771.73 E:0.141173 |  so really if they can keep getting that ball weight and then he looking for quality from the
[549.02 - 555.02] P:1744.31 E:0.126113 |  Liverpool fullbacks and the ball didn't go out of the penalty area for this latest Real Madrid
[555.02 - 560.70] P:1684.97 E:0.128332 |  goal kick Sergio Ramos kept it in I think also John with what Chris says there is that you know
[560.70 - 565.74] P:1667.04 E:0.137418 |  joy from the Liverpool fullbacks is if you know that you're not going to get tracked back once
[565.74 - 570.46] P:1637.60 E:0.144926 |  you get the ball it's imperative that the three forwards get in the box and get early crosses in
[571.10 - 578.22] P:1652.54 E:0.135520 |  it's a really large part of this game isn't it the fullback positions whether it's Trent Alexander
[578.22 - 584.30] P:1734.89 E:0.137662 |  Arnold and Cristiano Ronaldo or Marcelo and Mo Salah but it is Real Madrid with the ball on the
[584.30 - 590.14] P:1777.43 E:0.136178 |  right hand side and Liverpool Robertson is able to win it back and clear up the line it's kept in
[590.14 - 595.66] P:1716.81 E:0.149348 |  on the left hand side by Mane and Mane now driving it on Modric comes in with a challenge on it's
[595.66 - 599.18] P:1794.74 E:0.147670 |  a good one too I thought he was beaten there for a moment Modric but he recovered very well he's
[599.18 - 603.26] P:1536.73 E:0.130201 |  got to do everything Modric's on he's technically great he works ever so hard for the team great
[603.98 - 609.18] P:1704.25 E:0.144926 |  yeah he is one of the five that I mentioned who started all of the recent four finals Liverpool
[609.18 - 613.74] P:1654.95 E:0.137664 |  coming forward the ball into the penalty area but it just ran away from Fomino on the edge of the box
[613.74 - 619.02] P:1673.39 E:0.136760 |  and so Real Madrid were able to clear it long into the Liverpool half cross though now is under the
[619.02 - 624.54] P:1828.97 E:0.148336 |  ball uses Modric oh Modric's has a little heavy the challenge from behind by Mane and it is a free kick
[624.54 - 629.90] P:1881.44 E:0.146685 |  to Real Madrid I'm not sure the referee actually saw that although it was a free kick he did not see
[629.90 - 637.34] P:1723.76 E:0.130983 |  it was looking the other way Real Madrid 0 Liverpool 0 this is the Champions League final the genuine
[637.34 - 642.62] P:1814.70 E:0.149457 |  sound of the Champions League final live from Kiev on BBC radio Modric slipping the ball
[642.62 - 647.50] P:1834.48 E:0.136973 |  forward towards Benzema it's a question whether Benzema would start this game Gareth Bale only
[647.50 - 653.26] P:1823.07 E:0.131960 |  on the substitutes bench tonight and now Modric swings a high crossfield ball at Alexander Arnold
[653.26 - 658.54] P:1725.58 E:0.137514 |  heads away but Marcelo is quickly up onto it Marcelo turns away from Milner on his left foot
[658.54 - 663.10] P:1774.96 E:0.159845 |  shoots but drags it well wide by four or five. Marcelo picked that up really well he swallows
[663.10 - 667.26] P:1825.72 E:0.136042 |  that now and got ahead of his anticipation was excellent a bit nice bit of skill to get a back
[667.26 - 672.30] P:1614.88 E:0.126777 |  on who's left football you're not happy with the shot that was well weighed already tonight
[673.18 - 678.86] P:1684.04 E:0.138172 |  the big football news back home the fact that Fullerman are in the Premier League next season
[678.86 - 686.06] P:1565.33 E:0.136478 |  after winning 1-0 against former European champions Aston Villa 1-0 the final score at Wembley and he
[686.38 - 693.50] P:1593.11 E:0.137766 |  0-0 with 10 minutes on the clock in Kiev and what has been a perfect day weather wise well it's
[693.50 - 699.02] P:1581.58 E:0.148362 |  actually been quite breezy and you can just feel a breeze swirling around the inside of the stadium
[699.02 - 704.78] P:1658.25 E:0.131396 |  but hardly a cloud in the sky warm sunshine but now it's a little cooler and these are almost
[704.78 - 713.34] P:1718.24 E:0.129198 |  perfect conditions for football here's Carvajal to Modric back it goes to Varan in central defence
[713.34 - 720.30] P:1694.96 E:0.138164 |  suddenly Ronaldo finds himself right through the middle probably part of the the plan for Zinedine
[720.30 - 725.50] P:1675.00 E:0.140392 |  Zidane who's looking to become the first coach to win the Champions League three years running
[726.38 - 730.62] P:1661.71 E:0.136630 |  amazing to think that he faced questions last night about how he was under pressure as the
[730.62 - 737.42] P:1856.43 E:0.139528 |  Real Madrid coach here is Kroos and now Isko whistles from the Liverpool supporters because Real Madrid
[737.42 - 741.98] P:1961.18 E:0.145841 |  have had I think the longest period of sustained possession that we've seen in the match so far
[741.98 - 746.94] P:1894.10 E:0.138326 |  from either team never a good at it on the one such angles and like it can just play as well in
[746.94 - 751.74] P:1839.60 E:0.137402 |  going anybody and they look after the ball Liverpool which talks so much about the thrilling run that
[751.74 - 756.54] P:1826.71 E:0.143736 |  they've had to this Champions League final but as Sergio Ramos was pointing out tonight and he's in
[756.54 - 761.98] P:1660.89 E:0.132958 |  possession right now they have had a tough road the defending champions themselves having won
[761.98 - 767.42] P:1772.05 E:0.119018 |  against the champions of France the champions of Italy and the champions of Germany in the knockout
[767.42 - 772.70] P:1711.09 E:0.124405 |  rounds of this competition and they're still standing even though the only finished third
[772.70 - 779.18] P:1732.20 E:0.147951 |  in the Spanish League this season many can only beat champions maybe they can so it is third in
[779.18 - 785.66] P:1620.73 E:0.143204 |  the Spanish League against fourth in the Premier League but forget that they are European royalty
[785.66 - 790.70] P:1691.53 E:0.143794 |  Mane there's a high foot there on on Mane that they're caught in from Isko but the referee allows
[790.70 - 796.78] P:1723.93 E:0.122893 |  play to continue and Mane is okay so Real Madrid back in possession inside their own half and after
[796.78 - 802.94] P:1801.83 E:0.135026 |  that sort of frantic first six or seven minutes suddenly Real Madrid have just taken control of
[802.94 - 807.18] P:1736.72 E:0.140250 |  things but we thought this could happen John you know we knew Liverpool started right the year for
[807.18 - 811.42] P:1847.90 E:0.133741 |  first six minutes they've dropped off the pace a little bit because there's a lot of respect for
[811.42 - 816.78] P:1802.08 E:0.154251 |  Real Madrid yeah Henderson playing it through I think Mane was caught there by Kross in the centre
[816.78 - 821.34] P:1780.64 E:0.150248 |  circle it was a bouncing ball that was running away from him and referee message says yes he was
[821.34 - 825.98] P:1666.02 E:0.128487 |  it's a free kick to Liverpool and they take it short here's Alexander Arnett you've got the ball for
[826.06 - 830.22] P:1635.70 E:0.126961 |  last time no three or four minutes they have Alexander Arnett gives it to Vain Aldam Vain Aldam
[830.22 - 835.34] P:1733.45 E:0.138248 |  who scored that that ever so important goal as it turned out in the end in Rome all Robertson does
[835.34 - 840.70] P:1746.19 E:0.140303 |  very well and takes it on and plays it across the edge of the penalty area it bounces back and now
[840.70 - 845.26] P:1804.36 E:0.151699 |  Mane's little ball to Salah Salah shoots on the turn it's blocked Mane in the area he should
[845.26 - 849.66] P:1756.96 E:0.148952 |  he defected to Firmino on the left hand side of the box Firmino just holds it up against Carvajal
[849.66 - 854.06] P:1700.45 E:0.136852 |  plays it back out of the penalty area that was a clever ball from Firmino now it's worked towards
[854.06 - 858.54] P:1811.57 E:0.139466 |  Alexander Arnett on the right hand side chips it across Navas dives forward twinches it out of
[858.54 - 863.74] P:1729.38 E:0.157566 |  the penalty area where Ronaldo wins ahead of the Liverpool are back in possession and there we saw
[863.74 - 871.02] P:1685.06 E:0.132682 |  it really for the first time Liverpool suddenly causing alarms for the Real Madrid defence just
[871.02 - 875.66] P:1698.89 E:0.145301 |  mayhem John just absolute mayhem in there when the ball comes in from Madrid's tiny here here they
[875.66 - 881.02] P:1664.16 E:0.142078 |  come again Vain Aldam to the edge of the area but he has challenged and challenged well by Casamiro
[881.02 - 886.14] P:1780.60 E:0.156584 |  and now Real Madrid cross the halfway line and it's passed out a play by Cross most unlike
[886.14 - 892.30] P:1818.22 E:0.157826 |  an Inpenso Mal frustratingly to Cross points in the other direction is it to say I wondered it there
[892.30 - 897.74] P:1592.67 E:0.142979 |  not there to be fair he ran quick checks then went again and Cruz very rarely gives the ball away
[897.74 - 902.06] P:1596.33 E:0.149804 |  let's be honest just a little bit more than a standing which they needed a breather there to get
[902.06 - 906.70] P:1625.88 E:0.146316 |  up the field and also Ronaldo ran out to the right so he didn't even come to the ball himself
[907.34 - 913.74] P:1743.91 E:0.146820 |  it is 0-0 Real Madrid 0 Liverpool 0 5 live World Service Radio Merseyside from the BBC
[914.30 - 920.86] P:1647.51 E:0.133411 |  the stadium here 70,000 capacity to mark of a real 70,000 capacity how would the two clubs only
[920.86 - 929.10] P:1781.38 E:0.136405 |  get 16,000 kickouts is it well Chris said it there really throwing on the halfway line Marcelo
[929.10 - 936.46] P:1678.93 E:0.129216 |  to take this towards Benzema to not have the best of seasons Calum Benzema and now inside his own
[937.42 - 942.54] P:1792.14 E:0.151308 |  little one twos with Marcelo and cross then up towards this goal but it bounces off a little
[942.54 - 947.50] P:1802.44 E:0.151722 |  bit of this goal but Liverpool then lose possession and now it's been taken on by Carvajal on the right
[947.50 - 952.78] P:1766.67 E:0.153578 |  hand side plays the ball Ronaldo into a penalty area on the right drives it go with but over
[952.78 - 958.54] P:1759.48 E:0.146885 |  the angle of post and bar went for it himself he had options in the middle but Ronaldo in that
[958.54 - 963.82] P:1635.73 E:0.136524 |  position was only one thing in his mind exactly John good little move was that he commits himself
[963.82 - 968.70] P:1563.13 E:0.141481 |  Robertson so easy and then he's looking to be very as a quick glance doesn't say what is one
[968.70 - 974.78] P:1688.16 E:0.133638 |  thing in his mind power goes all across far was on that far away we've had 15 minutes now mark
[974.78 - 980.30] P:1595.08 E:0.142364 |  what are you thinking so far I'm thinking this this is really even Steven I think Madrid are
[980.30 - 985.58] P:1503.24 E:0.129377 |  frightened to death when Liverpool get the ball in and around the Madrid penalty area and maybe
[985.58 - 990.14] P:1630.86 E:0.136067 |  Liverpool a little bit in so far as they know there's always that risk that they might get caught
[990.14 - 995.34] P:1682.09 E:0.113634 |  on the break but probably Liverpool led you know I know a lot of people have made the point about
[995.34 - 1000.06] P:1968.03 E:0.137854 |  how you know Real Madrid the only experience and whatnot Jurgen Klopp was very clear to say it
[1000.06 - 1006.46] P:1875.04 E:0.127478 |  yesterday yes that's all very well but they've not played us before no and you know in Liverpool
[1006.46 - 1011.02] P:1784.69 E:0.140218 |  the way they played up they do not respect any other team and they just run at them which we've
[1011.02 - 1016.70] P:1699.73 E:0.133980 |  seen and now Milner loses out in an aerial bounce of the ball so Marcelo takes it on now here's
[1016.70 - 1022.94] P:1818.37 E:0.126332 |  the dangerous Modric for this long-lanke blonde hair giving it to Carvajal on the right hand side
[1022.94 - 1029.66] P:1835.15 E:0.124890 |  Ronaldo who's now taken up a position on the right little shimmy from him quick movement of the feet
[1029.66 - 1034.94] P:1810.29 E:0.130245 |  in the way that almost only Ronaldo can and then plays a backwards pass it's made its way to Isco
[1034.94 - 1041.18] P:1848.56 E:0.129743 |  on the left hand side Isco with a flourish plays it to Sergio Ramos now in the full back position
[1041.18 - 1046.14] P:1764.66 E:0.136206 |  Isco little ball towards Marcelo back to Isco on the left hand side Isco's right foot across
[1046.14 - 1051.42] P:1720.91 E:0.135524 |  towards the back post a leap and a header away by Robertson comes out to Casanero and little
[1051.42 - 1055.74] P:1700.44 E:0.149152 |  angle ball from him towards Ronaldo strong challenge from Mane but there was cover there from
[1055.74 - 1061.02] P:1724.12 E:0.140811 |  Modric now the ball on the right hand side with Real Madrid and then Ronaldo was on his heels
[1061.66 - 1067.50] P:1739.99 E:0.151417 |  and Liverpool weren't Robertson weren't and now Liverpool breaking over the halfway line with
[1067.50 - 1073.58] P:1813.75 E:0.135028 |  Mane Salah points where he wants it but Mane held the ball there and it goes back to Henderson in
[1073.58 - 1079.50] P:1887.82 E:0.142163 |  the centre circle nil nil if you've just joined us here in Kiev Alexander-Arnold goes for a high
[1079.50 - 1083.18] P:1790.65 E:0.129622 |  angle pass towards the edge of the area but that was watched all the way onto the forehead of
[1083.18 - 1088.30] P:1707.99 E:0.147814 |  Varela. You can see the temptation and release Salah one on one with Ramos on a race he fenced
[1088.30 - 1094.22] P:1783.74 E:0.155885 |  his chances didn't he but the wrist back comes in. Carlos pass from I think it was Carvajal on the
[1094.22 - 1100.38] P:1738.69 E:0.147059 |  right hand side across his own penalty area not a particular danger but it was nowhere near anyone
[1100.38 - 1104.54] P:1665.50 E:0.144403 |  else in white and it went in for a corner the only person that was near to it was with Ramos and
[1104.54 - 1109.50] P:1557.73 E:0.147390 |  he decided that he probably couldn't deal with it because he was facing his own goal so we have
[1109.50 - 1117.66] P:1619.01 E:0.139851 |  the first corner of this 2018 Champions League final Liverpool have it almost 18 minutes played
[1118.62 - 1128.30] P:1753.78 E:0.143183 |  and the corner to be taken from the right and we have Mane in the six yard but here's the delivery
[1128.30 - 1132.06] P:1764.94 E:0.141599 |  go on to back post now that comes for it was struggling there were two Liverpool players
[1132.06 - 1136.38] P:1864.79 E:0.129694 |  van Dyck most forcibly put in the challenge don't think he's given that as a free kick
[1136.38 - 1141.90] P:1716.86 E:0.124246 |  he's had it over no and I think the next corner to get our free kick do exactly the same thing
[1141.90 - 1146.94] P:1600.80 E:0.140627 |  the goalkeeper was nowhere near it nowhere no where near he ended up on his back side
[1147.50 - 1151.90] P:1647.17 E:0.140033 |  you've got to say he's really he keeps his shape because he's a very good shot stopper isn't he
[1151.90 - 1157.02] P:1660.82 E:0.149054 |  we know across his and he punches everything when he can and but he is a very very good shot stopper
[1157.90 - 1163.90] P:1590.16 E:0.144864 |  but obviously constant rumors about whether he might be replaced as the Real Madrid goalkeeper
[1164.62 - 1172.14] P:1684.17 E:0.127082 |  here is Marcelo off inside his own half Jürgen Klopp standing with his hands clasped behind his back
[1172.78 - 1179.74] P:1820.96 E:0.144382 |  Jürgen Klopp who's lost in his last five finals as a manager either at Liverpool where he said
[1179.74 - 1183.90] P:1849.09 E:0.143139 |  two of them the League Cup and the Europa League in Basel two years ago against Sevilla
[1183.98 - 1190.30] P:1787.84 E:0.132853 |  Uni Emery's Sevilla if you remember and then before that three with Borussia Dortmund Real Madrid
[1190.30 - 1195.66] P:1800.45 E:0.139580 |  with the ball at the back being pressed by Klopp's Liverpool and they have to go back to us
[1195.66 - 1199.10] P:1526.80 E:0.140460 |  the time they're on they've got to the brilliant they're playing the ball a feet and little given
[1199.10 - 1203.66] P:1691.98 E:0.148298 |  goals they've got nobody can run in behind now not one player stretches them they don't not one of
[1203.66 - 1207.66] P:1553.71 E:0.154321 |  them takes off is if they come to the ball and say I'm off go on play it play it down the side
[1207.66 - 1216.22] P:1535.24 E:0.164467 |  and I'll trace it nobody does five live Real Madrid nil Liverpool nil and it's Ali Ali Ali
[1216.86 - 1223.66] P:1608.56 E:0.158358 |  from the Liverpool supporters twirling their scarves above their heads I mean 16 000 official
[1223.66 - 1228.14] P:1677.81 E:0.151323 |  ticket allowance but there are many more than 16 000 Liverpool supporters in this stadium here
[1228.14 - 1233.50] P:1494.96 E:0.155369 |  tonight as Marcelo rubs the back of his head he was challenged with no free kick referee has
[1233.50 - 1238.70] P:1536.96 E:0.153331 |  allowed it to run when he when he can and Real Madrid back in possession with almost 20 minutes
[1238.70 - 1246.06] P:1453.50 E:0.169380 |  played when it is still nil nil for round goes for a long left-footed ball it's got a lot of the
[1246.06 - 1250.62] P:1593.57 E:0.153141 |  drop over his shoulder but couldn't keep it in it's out of play for a three-in John that's two or
[1250.62 - 1255.26] P:1575.80 E:0.145714 |  three times if you use the diagonal and basically they just put it out of play Madrid good pressure
[1255.26 - 1259.74] P:1769.15 E:0.138468 |  from Liverpool they're almost sensing come on then what what you're going to do and as Chris says
[1260.22 - 1264.94] P:1707.55 E:0.143323 |  until Madrid make the pitch bigger they're going to struggle to get possession in the
[1264.94 - 1270.14] P:1656.35 E:0.147111 |  third final third or Liverpool's final third certainly yeah they have unsettled Real Madrid
[1270.14 - 1277.50] P:1596.24 E:0.159966 |  I mean the latent track is always there from Real Madrid but one of the many banners in the
[1277.50 - 1286.94] P:1522.40 E:0.140105 |  Liverpool end reads we are what you fear the Scousers are here which had a certain ominous tone to it
[1286.94 - 1291.74] P:1612.73 E:0.145548 |  here's Isco who turns infield away from Vine Elgin on a little challenge that's why I'm very
[1291.74 - 1296.78] P:1642.46 E:0.126889 |  surprised that the ball didn't stop and you can sense you can come on and somebody will actually
[1296.78 - 1303.66] P:1532.37 E:0.112310 |  they will both run in behind unless it's his game plan the other thing as well is is that
[1304.30 - 1309.74] P:1512.23 E:0.149174 |  Carvajal basically is the only right-sided player who's got any chance of getting forward
[1309.74 - 1315.02] P:1551.80 E:0.146475 |  there's nobody in front of him this is a because it's almost like Carvajal and Robertson are playing
[1315.02 - 1323.42] P:1434.81 E:0.128738 |  against each other in both ends. Real with the ball at the back Sergio Ramos Real Madrid's number
[1323.42 - 1331.42] P:1730.82 E:0.141733 |  four 32 years old now long pass from him Isco Ronaldo currently through the middle but a challenge
[1332.22 - 1338.38] P:1933.86 E:0.155555 |  on Carvajal on the half way line James Milner with it he's fine John Benzema goes rolling around
[1338.38 - 1343.10] P:1974.23 E:0.132658 |  is rolling around the mid-mid player because he wants a booking
[1345.98 - 1350.14] P:1708.30 E:0.137504 |  quick free kick looking for an elbow through the middle that it was calmly dealt with by Van
[1350.14 - 1355.74] P:1708.61 E:0.125192 |  Dijk the January sizing and signing the world record defender and now Robertson with a long
[1355.74 - 1360.94] P:1766.37 E:0.144942 |  ball over the top his stretch it's missed by Baran it's not on towards Mane but the covering
[1360.94 - 1366.86] P:1719.30 E:0.126934 |  challenge from Sergio Ramos to take the ball away from Mane that was a really good opportunity for
[1367.10 - 1373.58] P:1743.42 E:0.134814 |  Liverpool the header to try and play Mane in was actually too heavy if he'd been the right way
[1373.58 - 1378.62] P:1776.77 E:0.151073 |  Mane would have been in on goal on that pass that's Mark Lawlinson Kelly Kates is with us here we'll
[1378.62 - 1384.86] P:1740.16 E:0.123694 |  have a six or six by the way at the end of this match so you can talk to Kelly and Mark about the
[1384.86 - 1391.18] P:1774.03 E:0.138677 |  Champions League final and whatever unfolds over the course of the next what hour or so here is
[1391.18 - 1396.46] P:1721.14 E:0.128171 |  Vijnaldum it's Mil-Mil Vijnaldum turning away from Isco and playing the ball out for Robertson
[1396.46 - 1401.02] P:1691.54 E:0.133968 |  on the left hand side so Liverpool have started well they have created threats here they come
[1401.02 - 1407.18] P:1702.69 E:0.126336 |  again with Vijnaldum they will play the ball out towards the left hand side and Milner exchanges
[1407.18 - 1412.38] P:1682.17 E:0.160665 |  passes gets it back Milner's low ball in towards Firmino who turns and shoots it's booked away to
[1412.38 - 1418.06] P:1782.20 E:0.161757 |  Alexander-Royals he drives it in and it's saved by Kelly now that's more on that from Chris Wubble
[1418.06 - 1421.58] P:1832.40 E:0.160195 |  and from Mark Lawlinson and Alan Dream now the half-time
[1425.82 - 1431.02] P:1771.03 E:0.159574 |  two chances for Liverpool to take the lead first Firmino and then Alexander-Arnold
[1431.74 - 1434.62] P:1787.63 E:0.148951 |  and actually Madrid just held them out
[1436.22 - 1441.02] P:1576.50 E:0.147650 |  Madrid are rocking Alan they're absolutely rocking here it'd be a great time to score
[1441.98 - 1447.02] P:1625.02 E:0.156171 |  oh wait it was a great save you really caught it well and it was he got down very
[1447.02 - 1451.26] P:1738.05 E:0.164716 |  too straight and held on to it but they've just they did the play nice football round
[1451.26 - 1454.38] P:1664.49 E:0.160599 |  they did but they just can't get up the pile it's there's nobody wants to run
[1456.14 - 1463.18] P:1595.94 E:0.142839 |  van Dijk plays it heftily outfield beyond Manny and is headed curfew back by Carpajal to goalkeeper
[1463.18 - 1470.46] P:2004.50 E:0.153431 |  Navas just feel Mark with Liverpool starting too brightly they need to score yeah
[1471.02 - 1475.74] P:1829.59 E:0.141519 |  yeah but I think I think they feel that's really the last passes you played that you know
[1475.74 - 1481.42] P:1793.85 E:0.148764 |  that these very very possible Madrid now can't even get their passing going
[1481.42 - 1487.10] P:1781.61 E:0.137462 |  the pressing for Liverpool is wonderful the ball is back with Karius Karius said to the captain
[1487.10 - 1493.42] P:1741.65 E:0.138063 |  Henderson and now the German keeper wants more Ronaldo just falling out there with with Benzemar
[1493.42 - 1497.18] P:1665.92 E:0.141142 |  as well in terms of closing people down so it's all good for Liverpool's final view
[1497.34 - 1504.78] P:1710.82 E:0.141330 |  and Ronaldo cuts out rather frustrated figure at the moment you know looking for support from the referee
[1506.06 - 1510.06] P:1492.15 E:0.153416 |  that would be unfair support if he got it Alexander-Arnold with a throw and

[1542.62 - 1547.26] P:1757.04 E:0.143126 |  Isco where can he go and look pressing absolutely magnificent are they fouled him
[1547.98 - 1553.90] P:1811.74 E:0.161784 |  he fouled it I don't think Liverpool players think that it was a foul but he had him running towards
[1553.90 - 1557.90] P:1870.76 E:0.152103 |  his own goal as Salah's gone down yeah it doesn't look too good he's going to blow in the face
[1557.90 - 1563.34] P:1763.12 E:0.138535 |  is he short shoulder yeah he's holding his left shoulder look he's still on it it was the way he
[1563.34 - 1569.42] P:1749.92 E:0.135082 |  went down yeah he's doing it yeah he's gracious ouch ouch ouch just watching the replay the tackle was
[1569.42 - 1576.62] P:1804.19 E:0.127715 |  by Ramos the captain of Real Madrid Salah felt very awkwardly I hope that's not
[1576.62 - 1582.38] P:1795.49 E:0.143019 |  dislocated Liverpool must hope that he'll be all right to continue playing he certainly
[1582.38 - 1588.86] P:1576.31 E:0.144132 |  impainted the moment in receiving treatment yeah physio and the doctor on but just going back to
[1588.86 - 1594.06] P:1574.27 E:0.150956 |  the point is we worry about Salah from Liverpool's point of view they just have Madrid going towards
[1594.06 - 1599.50] P:1579.44 E:0.146177 |  on goal there's three Liverpool players around the Madrid player the last thing he wanted him to do
[1599.50 - 1604.78] P:1573.94 E:0.151593 |  was was fouling because he was he was panicking he could have pinched the ball off and I think
[1604.78 - 1608.78] P:1427.86 E:0.153005 |  they can sense it now Liverpool are feeling the game now 25 minutes and I think they're thinking
[1608.78 - 1613.74] P:1532.90 E:0.142835 |  you know what we can up the level here in the last five minutes of not the Real Madrid settle
[1614.62 - 1619.74] P:1574.28 E:0.155087 |  and the two had two decent half chances haven't we're seeing replay after replay if he instantly
[1619.74 - 1623.58] P:1538.26 E:0.152816 |  involved in Ramos and Salah do you think it was a foul by Ramos
[1626.46 - 1631.74] P:1784.09 E:0.174047 |  he certainly pulled Salah's right arm back Salah's onto his feet and this is little off the Liverpool fans
[1632.30 - 1636.54] P:1767.21 E:0.158400 |  and I think it's okay it's fine might be sore and he's pointing again
[1637.82 - 1643.02] P:1604.46 E:0.151483 |  to the physios and Liverpool fans will be concerned by the way talking about Liverpool fans
[1643.58 - 1649.66] P:1837.55 E:0.149516 |  if you look out from our commentary position in the west side of the arena Liverpool fans
[1649.74 - 1656.54] P:1748.80 E:0.136306 |  stretch from our right all along in front of us all around towards the left and about two
[1656.54 - 1663.18] P:1748.37 E:0.146657 |  thirds around the other side it looks like it's two thirds red to one third white for Real Madrid
[1663.18 - 1667.66] P:1786.35 E:0.148141 |  well somebody said before they'd be about Liverpool about 40,000 Liverpool supporters
[1667.66 - 1672.38] P:1754.49 E:0.146433 |  in the stadium so that would be about right well the attendance tonight is 63,000 not the capacity
[1672.38 - 1678.94] P:1799.46 E:0.136920 |  70,000 63,000 players resumed Salah's back on the pitch ball said Mani in the far side Mani and
[1678.94 - 1684.30] P:1756.05 E:0.143309 |  Pimino started very brightly Mani beats one Real player taking on a second gets the cross in
[1684.30 - 1691.26] P:1874.75 E:0.156576 |  did he hit a defender well yes the referee responded belatedly I think he was helped out by the
[1691.26 - 1696.38] P:1859.19 E:0.149958 |  touchline official who looked along and well decided it's a corner at Liverpool stop dress
[1696.38 - 1701.74] P:1691.92 E:0.148916 |  touchline official how does something actually you see the manicured build-up before the game
[1702.78 - 1707.42] P:1653.04 E:0.154106 |  the way the five officials were running in tandem across the pitch yes they've been
[1707.50 - 1713.82] P:1666.15 E:0.145947 |  rehearsing out for weeks you know it's really ridiculous Milner will take the resultant corner
[1713.82 - 1720.86] P:1759.42 E:0.134180 |  for Liverpool and now Real Madrid might be just concerned about Virgil van Dijk yeah stick it
[1720.86 - 1724.78] P:1644.84 E:0.144051 |  stick it and in the other corners and we look like stick it in the same place see what the
[1724.78 - 1730.62] P:1826.71 E:0.138062 |  goalkeeper does do not foul him there it's played in towards Navas goalkeeper punches it away but
[1730.62 - 1737.10] P:1749.99 E:0.130867 |  this time the referee spots an infringement spots a foul and it's a free kick no Salah's down again
[1737.58 - 1744.78] P:1805.72 E:0.150965 |  this is worrying for Liverpool yeah it's hard to tell how Navas was fouled there
[1745.90 - 1751.50] P:1720.18 E:0.142131 |  Mohammed Salah's lying down in the middle of the Real Madrid half this would be a terrible
[1751.50 - 1759.74] P:1701.22 E:0.127807 |  blow he's in tears my shoulder you could lip read what he said there right shoulder I have to say a
[1759.74 - 1765.58] P:1575.62 E:0.136428 |  dislocated man in a european cup final and at Heisel I knew straight away though that was
[1765.58 - 1771.34] P:1695.33 E:0.132315 |  dislocated because I've done it before I don't know whether it is is fully dislocated but but
[1771.34 - 1777.42] P:1623.17 E:0.135480 |  obviously it's like a ball and socket thing and once it comes out once Alan it stays out permanently
[1777.42 - 1786.14] P:1563.05 E:0.146123 |  unless you have an operation while he's in tears and it is double tears because of the pain and the
[1786.14 - 1791.90] P:1636.11 E:0.161832 |  agony of knowing that he's about to leave the champions league final he's back on his feet again
[1792.54 - 1801.66] P:1663.07 E:0.151332 |  but I think that's only to walk off the field he's been top of it by Mane but Mohsala 44 goals this
[1801.66 - 1808.54] P:1733.66 E:0.155454 |  season 10 of them in the champions league a fantastic season for the Egyptian and it's not
[1808.54 - 1814.30] P:1869.51 E:0.151916 |  just the champions league final of the state year it's also Egypt in the World Cup you think
[1814.38 - 1819.90] P:1873.17 E:0.152304 |  the lana's coming up yep it is he's coming on the lana's coming on there this is this well you
[1819.90 - 1826.70] P:1833.73 E:0.154031 |  cannot underestimate the size of the blow to little two and he's coming out while I need it here
[1828.94 - 1836.06] P:1920.92 E:0.154120 |  well this is such a blow but I have to say of the front three so far in the opening
[1836.86 - 1843.98] P:1786.85 E:0.146880 |  28 29 minutes it's been manning for meal that have caused most difficulty for the Real Madrid
[1844.38 - 1849.18] P:1741.75 E:0.145128 |  yes it might just be the threat of Salah on the other side occupying two defenders and it's given
[1849.18 - 1857.82] P:1765.80 E:0.150067 |  Mane and Firmino the room to play so Mohsala is off after 30 minutes of the 2018 Champions League
[1857.82 - 1865.50] P:1823.43 E:0.157389 |  final the world will the lana play what's up on the left Mane will come right on the right and
[1865.50 - 1873.18] P:1834.06 E:0.152271 |  Firmino still through the middle it's a throw for Liverpool without question and it's heartening for
[1873.18 - 1880.06] P:1793.89 E:0.153874 |  Real Madrid who started the lesser impressive of the two tiers but it doesn't stop Liverpool
[1880.06 - 1886.30] P:1717.29 E:0.132398 |  pressing now it doesn't here's Van Dijk heading the ball away to Robertson as the game resumes
[1886.30 - 1891.98] P:1746.30 E:0.144261 |  ball played forward brilliantly chested pass by Firmino to the lana lana looks to find Mane
[1891.98 - 1897.58] P:1778.07 E:0.128622 |  can't quite do so I really I really cut looking at Madrid they're like a dog's dinner that they're
[1897.58 - 1907.02] P:1815.93 E:0.139203 |  absolutely all over the place the ball is back with Ramos whose challenge for or otherwise led
[1907.02 - 1914.94] P:1820.41 E:0.138178 |  to Salah's substitution Marcello into Cruz Cruz at the halfway line forward it goes Benzema takes
[1914.94 - 1920.30] P:1771.42 E:0.146003 |  it up Benzema oh plays it that's danger here for Liverpool Mavrick inside the penalty here Mavrick
[1920.30 - 1925.34] P:1841.61 E:0.164064 |  just shot was limp unconvincing heads of defender and he goes out of play for the glory great block
[1925.42 - 1931.02] P:1745.06 E:0.144181 |  by Robertson now excellent defending he got really really close and in those situations
[1931.02 - 1935.98] P:1793.93 E:0.146194 |  you're full back the first rule is make sure you're in in the way of it so it hits you at the very
[1935.98 - 1942.14] P:1639.05 E:0.131285 |  least Robertson cost a couple of quid it's a fantastic save unbelievable yeah unbelievable story
[1944.22 - 1949.50] P:1646.52 E:0.153467 |  from the throwing Real Madrid in possession it's still 0-0 here Liverpool and Real Madrid
[1950.14 - 1956.14] P:1870.09 E:0.155518 |  in Kiev Marcello back to Ramos who's being pulled by the Liverpool fans who clearly feel
[1957.02 - 1964.06] P:1824.58 E:0.142990 |  that his involvement in the challenge on Salah led to the Egyptians injury maybe maybe that's
[1964.62 - 1971.58] P:1775.23 E:0.133158 |  a bit harsh on Ramos anyway Cruz plays it forward to Isco right to Ronaldo on the left side Ronaldo
[1971.58 - 1976.70] P:1813.19 E:0.139160 |  to your outside the penalty here finds Marcello back to Ronaldo no takes it up Benzema with a shot
[1976.70 - 1981.42] P:1703.42 E:0.155938 |  as the ball broke down it's cleared by Liverpool's Milder and it goes towards the far side out of play
[1981.42 - 1985.66] P:1588.93 E:0.147144 |  for throwing to Real Madrid good defending by Liverpool as soon as the ball came to Benzema
[1985.66 - 1990.38] P:1684.96 E:0.140932 |  Milder was there very very quickly just stood up and say again just hit me I'm in the way
[1991.10 - 1999.02] P:1674.22 E:0.147426 |  having dominated since Salah's gone off Real have taken charge here's Isco once more
[1999.58 - 2004.14] P:1582.42 E:0.166792 |  tackled by Manny Manny wins the ball well Manny takes it past two Real players my
[2004.14 - 2009.10] P:1768.49 E:0.166087 |  taking it past the third that's what the challenge was that and I'm quite far out
[2010.14 - 2014.14] P:1798.77 E:0.147099 |  he's got my cousin here a lot he's got a free kick yeah he did a well he did a well Manny
[2014.14 - 2017.58] P:1761.49 E:0.145340 |  very cleverly disguised he was very good at getting free kicks you've got to say that but
[2017.58 - 2023.42] P:1805.59 E:0.136613 |  uh they've just stepped up the gears a little bit they have definitely good ball by Cruz I defined Isco
[2025.18 - 2030.78] P:1785.16 E:0.138750 |  Marcello to his left but it was played infield to Benzema I know it's with Modric just inside
[2030.78 - 2036.22] P:1619.47 E:0.137642 |  the centre circle inside the Liverpool half onto Carvajal on the far side of the field
[2036.22 - 2042.62] P:1734.94 E:0.147304 |  12 minutes to go to half time here you're missing the five life the World Service and Radio Merseyside
[2043.74 - 2048.70] P:1769.67 E:0.163821 |  Radio Merseyside will be particularly concerned about the disruption caused by
[2049.74 - 2056.22] P:1659.23 E:0.164223 |  the substitution of Mo Salah no good crossfield ball by Ramos to the far side
[2057.10 - 2062.22] P:1669.06 E:0.141503 |  control world two by Carvajal taking up ball played on to Carvajal again then the challenge
[2062.22 - 2068.94] P:1762.88 E:0.133041 |  came in by Robertson ball breaks to Lallana who came on a substitute for Mo Salah he chips it
[2068.94 - 2074.38] P:1761.42 E:0.150203 |  towards Fomino who's had a play off a Real body it's a throw into Liverpool who gets Liverpool
[2074.38 - 2079.10] P:1679.32 E:0.143004 |  the chance to move up the pitch yeah yeah just a little bit whoops somebody's done
[2079.82 - 2088.70] P:1802.51 E:0.158062 |  is that Ronaldo no no it's the right back is it not Carvajal Carvajal
[2092.54 - 2100.46] P:1691.33 E:0.137103 |  Ronaldo did I suppose console Mo Salah as he had to go off much of the way console David Beckham
[2100.46 - 2105.26] P:1692.04 E:0.146899 |  when he was instrumental in Beckham being set up in the World Cup game many years ago between
[2105.34 - 2108.78] P:1635.12 E:0.159338 |  England and Portugal he didn't wish the goal was not happy to get to Carvajal
[2108.78 - 2112.54] P:1616.71 E:0.155797 |  a little wink Carvajal pulled his arm string a few games ago didn't he where he missed the semi
[2112.54 - 2116.94] P:1580.41 E:0.165707 |  didn't he yeah he's only just come back after the hands away injury I think the way he's reacting
[2116.94 - 2122.22] P:1579.03 E:0.175779 |  is crying again I think he's crying in house he knows he's gone as well so if he plays like he did
[2122.22 - 2128.78] P:1592.73 E:0.164985 |  last day he put Vasquez way but he struggled badly yes Vasquez is on the bench he should put
[2128.78 - 2134.30] P:1612.95 E:0.160543 |  that shoulder if he's going to put anybody with respect to Carvajal if he has to be substituted
[2135.26 - 2139.50] P:1757.27 E:0.165744 |  there's no comparison in terms of the substitutions that have been enforced this is really interesting
[2139.50 - 2143.34] P:1630.60 E:0.155728 |  so Liverpool are having a break now they're coming over I was going to say and clock clock wasn't
[2143.34 - 2147.74] P:1668.57 E:0.158457 |  anywhere neither now he's jogging over to the players obviously to have a little word with them
[2149.34 - 2154.38] P:1499.97 E:0.174454 |  the break in play useful for Liverpool and the stretch is coming on for Carvajal
[2155.18 - 2161.02] P:1519.87 E:0.157526 |  the right full back of Ray on the drill 10 minutes to half time but quite a lot of time will have
[2161.02 - 2165.58] P:1418.51 E:0.153832 |  to be added on at the end of the regular 45 minutes because of the two injuries that have been
[2165.58 - 2173.10] P:1750.31 E:0.129632 |  sustained suddenly Carvajal's on his feet again is the stretcher on the pitch and over reaction
[2173.10 - 2174.30] P:1610.47 E:0.115792 |  I think that shows coming up
[2177.74 - 2180.62] P:1749.32 E:0.143933 |  interesting yeah Carvajal's definitely not continuing
[2180.62 - 2189.26] P:1757.78 E:0.156330 |  well he's crying as well it's not sure it is not to that is the better defender
[2190.70 - 2194.62] P:1634.18 E:0.156290 |  well that was evident any time we've been watching Ray on the drill of late
[2195.18 - 2205.02] P:1665.71 E:0.120748 |  seeing Vasquez at right back so Nacho being instructed by Zinedine to that and the Real
[2205.02 - 2212.38] P:1724.90 E:0.124552 |  coach telling him what he wants maybe more attention paid to Manny when he's done that side
[2213.58 - 2217.66] P:1743.63 E:0.149500 |  having managed him pretty well very good very good but this might not work out particularly well
[2217.66 - 2221.10] P:1753.69 E:0.156021 |  for Liverpool lines that is more of a naturally defended Nacho
[2224.06 - 2229.34] P:1800.34 E:0.157007 |  while the Liverpool fans are applauding Carvajal as he's going off behind the goal to the left
[2229.34 - 2233.42] P:1726.09 E:0.149703 |  that's where most of the Liverpool fans are I say that's for most of them but there are two
[2233.42 - 2237.82] P:1728.03 E:0.140659 |  thirds around this stadium I don't think Nacho is going to affect because Adam Lallana is playing
[2237.82 - 2241.10] P:1624.96 E:0.156153 |  on the left isn't he Adam Lallana is not really going to see and I'm taking you one when I get the
[2241.10 - 2247.02] P:1733.78 E:0.151648 |  ball like Marnie but Robinson might well maybe maybe the game resumes Liverpool in possession
[2247.74 - 2252.46] P:1779.97 E:0.152173 |  following a Liverpool throw in it's back to Carrius Carrius sweeps it towards the far side
[2253.18 - 2258.06] P:1619.39 E:0.156463 |  neat header in field by Robertson tripped on Lallana gets to the ball chips it high
[2258.94 - 2261.10] P:1707.15 E:0.152511 |  falls down to Liverpool Milner take it through
[2263.66 - 2269.34] P:1814.88 E:0.152028 |  the pace of the pass just took the ball away from the Liverpool player through to the goalkeeper
[2269.34 - 2272.38] P:1747.35 E:0.139500 |  just wouldn't come down with it a little bit of loft on it
[2274.06 - 2279.10] P:1753.45 E:0.141668 |  here's Ronaldo with a pass to Benzema Benzema just nudges it back to Marsello and now it's
[2279.10 - 2287.74] P:1883.56 E:0.131675 |  Casinira to Modric Modric onto the far side of the field it's go back to the news right full
[2287.82 - 2294.22] P:1942.26 E:0.135008 |  back Nacho Modric wants more for Real Madrid eight minutes to half time plus a fair amount
[2294.78 - 2301.98] P:1931.38 E:0.142465 |  of added time that you can expect probably four minutes here's Ramos Liverpool supporters
[2301.98 - 2307.10] P:1884.39 E:0.143149 |  recognize it was Ramos in possession boom now it's played down the left flank and it's knocked

[2715.10 - 2721.74] P:1672.87 E:0.125250 |  I'm afraid I'm sorry tonight isn't great now I'm afraid I'm not afraid but Real Madrid's
[2721.74 - 2728.86] P:1703.08 E:0.138262 |  play isn't great which is great as it were inside the last minute of the first 45 at a time to come
[2728.86 - 2732.78] P:1744.28 E:0.144421 |  cross into the penalty by Benzler shot into the side netting so you won't you can see we're not
[2732.78 - 2737.58] P:1726.14 E:0.152694 |  real images not great but the last five ten point six minutes yeah really in the game the donated
[2737.58 - 2742.46] P:1719.83 E:0.118665 |  Liverpool have come off the gas and they're asking for trouble the drops really deep Liverpool
[2743.42 - 2749.58] P:1694.58 E:0.137415 |  and also Henderson sorry Robinson was so tucked in there that really should be able to chest that
[2749.58 - 2755.82] P:1736.63 E:0.135805 |  ball down when the cross comes in and roll it back to carriers right only three added minutes seems
[2755.82 - 2762.46] P:1800.33 E:0.132678 |  rather mean considering the two substantial injuries yeah Salah and Carver half certainly Salah's
[2762.46 - 2767.42] P:1681.86 E:0.127373 |  injuries seem to be at least three or four minutes on its own yeah you know he would down twice
[2767.42 - 2772.62] P:1733.33 E:0.142695 |  and he couldn't move and Carver half as well Liverpool has chipped in from the left-hand side
[2772.62 - 2777.10] P:1562.10 E:0.130962 |  by Liverpool but not before I think an Econo to play yesterday's the throw into Real Madrid
[2778.06 - 2783.10] P:1752.10 E:0.137857 |  and momentarily two balls I think we're on the pitch I think generally Klopp will be very pleased
[2783.10 - 2788.62] P:1652.62 E:0.144566 |  with Orville's first half apart from the last couple of warnings we've had late on in the first
[2788.62 - 2792.86] P:1613.25 E:0.158090 |  half where they just lacked a little bit of concentration and you can see how Madrid can
[2792.86 - 2797.34] P:1564.57 E:0.151577 |  get in the clear zone if they don't keep that tempo up and that person high up the field I'm
[2797.34 - 2801.58] P:1632.76 E:0.147084 |  seeing all the time really high but at least the middle of the park they've just showed me on it
[2801.58 - 2807.10] P:1686.74 E:0.136349 |  in the last five minutes what they can do there's a great ball by Cruz to the right side that's taken
[2807.10 - 2813.82] P:1726.12 E:0.129375 |  up by Nacho Nacho taps the ball in field it's with Cruz on the edge of the centre certainly
[2813.82 - 2818.46] P:1780.70 E:0.131661 |  chips it to Marcello Marcello controls it instantly good play from the Brazilian ball back edge of
[2818.46 - 2822.86] P:1823.71 E:0.146250 |  the Liverpool penalty area will he get the cross and no he can't do because Alexander Arles gets in
[2822.86 - 2827.82] P:1811.96 E:0.143486 |  the tackle even at the concentration of a corner very good defending what's the ball stood on his
[2827.82 - 2835.18] P:1782.44 E:0.123591 |  feet that was don't watch the feet what's the ball cornered around Madrid who have been much better
[2835.74 - 2842.54] P:1848.69 E:0.128038 |  since Salah went off injured Cruz to take the corner from the left-hand side only four
[2843.42 - 2848.46] P:1778.43 E:0.140961 |  white shirts in the penalty area and I think Liverpool had got everybody back I want to
[2848.46 - 2853.82] P:1718.37 E:0.124250 |  surprise Liverpool one possession to pull a corner from a player of the quality of Cruz
[2854.38 - 2860.06] P:1765.27 E:0.132832 |  here's Isco Isco not getting past Manny Manny's too strong from well played Manny
[2860.62 - 2865.82] P:1801.04 E:0.122586 |  on to Firmino Firmino taps it into the Henderson Henderson's chip in the direction of Manny but
[2865.82 - 2869.82] P:1760.23 E:0.119687 |  it's gone out of play on the throw into Real Madrid Marcello to take it
[2870.38 - 2877.26] P:1767.86 E:0.121625 |  Liverpool mustn't concede a goal here just before half time maybe the better side in the first half
[2879.02 - 2883.66] P:1753.01 E:0.124629 |  Real have it on the far side of the field with Baran Baran to
[2887.02 - 2892.46] P:1772.60 E:0.138634 |  Casemiro and Casemiro plays at the left side chested back by Marcello this is good play by
[2892.46 - 2898.38] P:1767.02 E:0.127035 |  Real on the left plate captain field to Benzema Benzema lines up the shot should
[2899.02 - 2904.38] P:1802.77 E:0.135610 |  wide carries had it covered got to say they've just come off the pace and you know Salah went off
[2905.34 - 2909.50] P:1701.69 E:0.132091 |  but the last 10 minutes you've got to say that Real Madrid have dominated the game they've had two
[2909.50 - 2914.14] P:1727.28 E:0.134684 |  decent chances and Liverpool really have been the best save for what 35 minutes of the game and
[2914.14 - 2920.54] P:1803.00 E:0.128841 |  they've just come off just seeing a replay of the offside against Ronaldo the assistant in the
[2920.54 - 2926.46] P:1770.82 E:0.136216 |  first I was completely correct though it was interesting he only raised his flag after the save
[2926.46 - 2931.02] P:1784.18 E:0.134303 |  had been made by Karius and Benzema tucked it away into the net as long as he raises it
[2933.02 - 2940.54] P:1718.10 E:0.124566 |  that's the heads of him, the clash of heads, Cruz and Milner, well Firmino it is rather and it's
[2940.54 - 2947.42] P:1583.47 E:0.134951 |  going to be Casemiro for the near-orders he seems to have come off worst
[2949.10 - 2954.22] P:1546.84 E:0.137365 |  referee demanding the ball I think he may well be growing the half-time whistle
[2954.22 - 2959.18] P:1614.97 E:0.141407 |  good news is Bobby's teeth are all right, his blue, yeah he has he wants half time
[2960.38 - 2966.78] P:1919.06 E:0.145660 |  but let's hope Casemiro is okay, well there's an accident with Casca Peds sending off for
[2966.78 - 2971.82] P:1764.70 E:0.131478 |  Milner's fault I think as well I think Liverpool generally have been in control of the game but
[2972.78 - 2978.14] P:1672.64 E:0.121811 |  once Salah has gone off it's a little bit it's a little bit like we've we've saw in Madrid they
[2978.14 - 2982.94] P:1700.47 E:0.120846 |  were kind of rattled for a long period of that game from the start and then all of a sudden
[2982.94 - 2988.30] P:1759.39 E:0.124087 |  Liverpool thought they'd done the job as Chris said they'd stop pressing and once they start pressing
[2988.30 - 2992.86] P:1740.99 E:0.128107 |  the two opportunities that Madrid had were as good as any opportunities in the game so far
[2992.86 - 2998.30] P:1719.42 E:0.121360 |  Chris yeah I agree I think 35 minutes Liverpool played which you expect they had a couple of
[2998.30 - 3002.22] P:1746.28 E:0.116994 |  good chances Navasmej couple saves they looked threatening all the time with the pace that's
[3002.22 - 3006.22] P:1731.64 E:0.122423 |  10 minutes they just come off the pace don't know why Ramsey came back in the game they look very
[3006.22 - 3012.46] P:1799.77 E:0.119854 |  dangerous themselves half-time Neil Mill thank you Kelly yes Real Madrid Mill Liverpool Mill
[3012.46 - 3019.42] P:1732.71 E:0.133783 |  so both sides had to make a substitution in the first half Salah replaced by Lallana and
[3019.50 - 3026.30] P:1627.12 E:0.145694 |  Carvajal replaced by Nacho and really they were agonising scenes to watch both players who were
[3026.30 - 3032.06] P:1693.00 E:0.140295 |  so upset having to leave the field in the first half of the Champions League final so Real Madrid
[3032.06 - 3038.22] P:1629.21 E:0.130819 |  with Navasen goal Nacho the substituted right back Verran Ramos and Marsello is the second half
[3038.22 - 3046.30] P:1781.37 E:0.127157 |  begins Real Madrid kicking off Casamiro and Modric and Croce in midfield with Isco, Benzema and Ronaldo
[3046.30 - 3052.06] P:1720.70 E:0.127387 |  there's been lots of movement between Ronaldo Isco and Benzema Ronaldo has been on the left he's
[3052.06 - 3056.38] P:1648.50 E:0.143071 |  been through the middle and he's been on the right hand side and the Liverpool team now carries
[3056.38 - 3062.14] P:1450.51 E:0.129519 |  in goal Alexander Arnold Lovren van Dyke and Robertson Henderson van Alden and Milner and then
[3062.14 - 3068.94] P:1710.32 E:0.116140 |  Lallana now on the left Mané on the right and Firmino through the middle so it is Neil Mill
[3069.58 - 3075.90] P:1818.67 E:0.120877 |  second half just a few seconds old and Liverpool in the almost all red kit with
[3075.90 - 3082.06] P:1649.21 E:0.111330 |  the white trim white numbers on the backs against the famous all white of Real Madrid the record
[3082.06 - 3086.78] P:1687.35 E:0.138875 |  winners of the European Cup he has Mané in the area on the left hand side goal running towards the

[3381.90 - 3388.78] P:1608.33 E:0.150257 |  well you won't concede a softer goal will you and he's trying to say to the referee Karius that
[3388.78 - 3393.34] P:1709.78 E:0.146496 |  obviously there was a problem with Benzema I don't think there was he tried to roll it really
[3393.34 - 3398.22] P:1693.63 E:0.129417 |  quickly and all Benzema did was actually just put his foot in the way and it just seemed to bounce
[3398.22 - 3406.14] P:1690.57 E:0.142512 |  off it it was such a simple goal but what it's a schoolboy howler absolutely schoolboy howler
[3406.14 - 3412.38] P:1773.92 E:0.138503 |  there's no way Karius can say that's a foul no that is bad decision making bad decision making
[3412.38 - 3420.06] P:1729.03 E:0.152177 |  I think he knew it Karius he knew that yeah yeah he was he was resigned to it he just under armed it
[3420.06 - 3427.42] P:1816.07 E:0.135037 |  into the outstretched left leg of Benzema who was leaning forward and it really just hit him
[3427.42 - 3431.10] P:1601.29 E:0.142550 |  and rebounded into the net Benzema the goal is scored against Bayern and the goal
[3431.66 - 3439.42] P:1652.96 E:0.142986 |  right wouldn't make a decision slipping over yeah well again everyone was saying yesterday

[3504.86 - 3509.74] P:1669.98 E:0.130385 |  by Jürgen Kron they don't all the time and that's all they've been brought up yeah but listen they
[3509.74 - 3515.58] P:1617.55 E:0.143572 |  spoke everyone last night spoke about how in a final like this the moments of luck fortune
[3515.58 - 3524.14] P:1571.17 E:0.150046 |  that's what it is mistakes whatever it's all but that is really a catastrophic in football in terms
[3524.14 - 3531.10] P:1812.70 E:0.154643 |  a catastrophic way to go a goal down in the match like this one nil Real Madrid lead this is five live
[3531.10 - 3535.10] P:1841.36 E:0.160593 |  ready on those you side in the world service from the BBC you can hear the frustration of
[3535.10 - 3539.98] P:1876.80 E:0.142852 |  another pool fans Mark Lawrence and yeah well also now Milner's on at the referee you know the
[3539.98 - 3546.14] P:1674.89 E:0.129469 |  senior pros in the Liverpool team we've almost got you've got to say forget it come on we need a goal
[3546.14 - 3550.62] P:1789.56 E:0.119476 |  let's just start playing football let's forget about everything else and let's get back to the
[3550.62 - 3556.70] P:1665.56 E:0.135960 |  way we played for the first half an hour at least in the first half so without more salad and now a
[3556.70 - 3561.82] P:1572.18 E:0.133456 |  goal behind here comes Robertson playing the ball in from the left hand side but it's lifted up
[3561.82 - 3567.82] P:1571.63 E:0.134779 |  not not completely away by Casemiro and Mane was able to get to it that was poor from Real Madrid
[3567.82 - 3573.90] P:1765.69 E:0.146056 |  Mane plays it to Milner Milner left it in it takes a flick off the head of Ferran which took it away
[3573.90 - 3579.02] P:1783.60 E:0.153586 |  from Firmino who was inside the six yard box and it's through for a corner that's a good response
[3579.02 - 3583.42] P:1832.64 E:0.152173 |  to play ball in by Milner wasn't it just misses this smile he just gets it tooks on him around
[3583.42 - 3589.42] P:1734.04 E:0.156564 |  Disney I mean you can't get out of the far post towards the corner Milner running over to take the
[3589.42 - 3594.46] P:1707.86 E:0.140137 |  corner with his arms whips up the Liverpool supporters at that end of the ground Liverpool
[3594.46 - 3600.22] P:1519.06 E:0.149777 |  both teams attacking towards the the ends where the bulk of their supporters are Milner with the
[3600.22 - 3604.78] P:1620.88 E:0.138001 |  corner one nil down Liverpool here it is it's a high one towards the penalty spot and it's headed
[3604.78 - 3609.58] P:1824.91 E:0.175876 |  by Lovren and pocked into the net by Mane Liverpool have equalised
[3612.14 - 3619.42] P:1798.53 E:0.172456 |  Real Madrid were in front for only four minutes the header from Lovren and Mane got the crucial
[3619.42 - 3625.18] P:1784.06 E:0.164867 |  touch inside the six yard box to make it Real Madrid one Liverpool one well that's the way you
[3625.18 - 3631.02] P:1603.62 E:0.161221 |  reply when you go go down in the final and a joke go to give away well done to Mane just
[3631.02 - 3636.46] P:1691.42 E:0.159168 |  involved in an incident with Ramos he's just got on with it and he's put Liverpool right back in this
[3636.46 - 3643.02] P:1710.50 E:0.157452 |  game I've got to say he's been Liverpool's best player tonight Mane's been excellent we're just
[3643.02 - 3647.34] P:1711.00 E:0.154454 |  looking at it here no he's not offside he's well onside he's reacted first got there before they
[3647.34 - 3651.74] P:1772.41 E:0.152535 |  keep up and it's a good touch but he reacts more shallow does it the goalie does it and he's there
[3652.70 - 3658.38] P:1698.53 E:0.151435 |  definitely onside and he's headed as well he could head about Lovren yeah strong Mane has been the
[3658.46 - 3665.82] P:1760.74 E:0.156442 |  best player tonight for Liverpool well everyone was predicting goals I don't think many were predicting
[3665.82 - 3672.78] P:1775.01 E:0.157586 |  no no at half time but we've now had a goal a piece and we're 10 minutes into the second half
[3672.78 - 3677.34] P:1819.44 E:0.153672 |  nothing gets you going more than a goal John well it's certainly got those Liverpool supporters
[3677.34 - 3683.34] P:1806.55 E:0.151765 |  going smoke bombs have been let off there is red smoke oh that's it a lunging challenge by
[3684.30 - 3688.30] P:1805.53 E:0.145903 |  Roberton on Nacho and Real Madrid coming forward Nacho's okay he's back on his feet
[3688.30 - 3692.86] P:1808.40 E:0.152131 |  Marcelo plays it square he has crossed into the penalty area his goal but it was intersected
[3692.86 - 3697.26] P:1768.22 E:0.153906 |  crucially by Henderson got my game now isn't it Tim O's back now both teams going for it
[3697.82 - 3705.50] P:1635.68 E:0.146764 |  feels like a cut match this is more what we expected one one after the free goal scored by
[3705.50 - 3708.94] P:1515.19 E:0.165303 |  Benzema terrible error by Karius terrible error
[3710.70 - 3717.58] P:1526.16 E:0.169668 |  and as Mark and Chris have been saying absolutely crucial that Karius not easy puts that out of his
[3717.58 - 3723.58] P:1595.38 E:0.165462 |  mind he's just got to forget about it he's helped massively by the fact that Mane has equalised
[3724.14 - 3728.86] P:1559.70 E:0.164019 |  says Marcelo now for Real Madrid goal towards Ronaldo beautiful touch from Ronaldo turns
[3728.86 - 3733.98] P:1655.02 E:0.159605 |  goes for the pipeline Lovren slides in and is able to scoop it away out for a throw down the length
[3734.06 - 3739.50] P:1532.50 E:0.167270 |  you can feel the game being extended quite you can just as you as you're watching it it's starting
[3739.50 - 3745.18] P:1605.52 E:0.176287 |  to spread out completely brilliant noise from the Liverpool supporters absolutely superb
[3746.46 - 3752.14] P:1464.89 E:0.171237 |  Real Madrid take the throw Marcelo gets it back swirls it in and it's headed away by
[3752.14 - 3760.22] P:1625.44 E:0.155814 |  Van Gaik just readjusted Liverpool's number four clears it out to Isco on the right hand side
[3760.22 - 3767.34] P:1550.35 E:0.158603 |  Isco back towards Nacho who came on as the substitute for Carvajales in the Spanish
[3767.34 - 3773.10] P:1472.38 E:0.164757 |  World Cup squad Nacho we will have courage of the World Cup on five live for you coming up in the
[3773.10 - 3777.74] P:1513.80 E:0.168801 |  next couple of weeks whenever there's a match on you'll hear it either on five live or sports extra
[3777.74 - 3783.58] P:1439.42 E:0.159367 |  live from Russia Marcelo little touch then back towards the halfway line and Mane puts in the
[3783.58 - 3789.90] P:1724.24 E:0.151486 |  challenge and now Sergio Ramos takes it on wins a throw in off by Naldum on the far side and Mane
[3789.90 - 3793.98] P:1669.29 E:0.144575 |  has taken a knock and he's down on his knees and Cruz left his foot in a little bit there because
[3793.98 - 3797.90] P:1702.45 E:0.143756 |  he lost possession and he got it back he sort of left his foot in Armani
[3800.06 - 3806.86] P:1587.38 E:0.151253 |  Sergio Mane that goal by the way was his 20th of the season the third Liverpool player to reach
[3806.86 - 3813.58] P:1548.26 E:0.157739 |  20 this season after Salah and Firmino and he now has also got 10 goals in the Champions League
[3813.58 - 3817.82] P:1484.36 E:0.153094 |  this season just like Salah and Firmino in the competition proper that is
[3818.70 - 3823.90] P:1680.30 E:0.157797 |  one won the score Jürgen Klopp wildly waving his arms on the edge of the coaching area as
[3823.90 - 3829.10] P:1754.96 E:0.157773 |  Nacho was put under pressure but Real Madrid calmly and the great pressing played away
[3830.14 - 3837.90] P:1830.26 E:0.154662 |  out of difficulty that red smoke is still drifting across the Kiev stadium here and we can smell it
[3837.90 - 3843.58] P:1563.84 E:0.152579 |  as well here's Modric back towards Isko Liverpool flying into the challenges Milner in with the
[3843.58 - 3848.94] P:1689.07 E:0.145306 |  latest one on Modric and then Casamiro had three Liverpool players around him then that's given
[3848.94 - 3853.10] P:1687.21 E:0.150859 |  away by Van Dyke and Real Madrid back in possession in St. Paul. That's fantastic at the minute that
[3853.10 - 3857.50] P:1629.73 E:0.134187 |  goal was given at least a late point how long can they keep it up well that they just got a common
[3857.50 - 3863.34] P:1656.15 E:0.143207 |  goal and it's over 18, pressure the right team that's what they're trying to do Mane who's okay back
[3863.34 - 3868.46] P:1650.95 E:0.159064 |  on his feet but Marcelo is wriggling away from him. Marcelo goes down the ball runs free there's no
[3868.46 - 3874.54] P:1777.28 E:0.161837 |  free kick now it's taken on but Van Alden sort of lost his foot in there as much as anything.
[3875.10 - 3879.98] P:1840.35 E:0.170588 |  Modric now Modric just overrun it and Robertson came in with a challenge and whacked it away
[3880.78 - 3886.30] P:1831.76 E:0.164404 |  I think he made contact with Modric as well but he's got a ball good tackle. Not him wrong with that
[3886.30 - 3891.90] P:1765.24 E:0.145407 |  yeah the ball had a ball. Good tackle. Well done Nefri by the way. I think he's he's led it close
[3891.98 - 3893.74] P:1690.54 E:0.132188 |  yeah. Not Nefri a few questions.
[3896.06 - 3900.46] P:1692.23 E:0.158326 |  One won the score. We just over half an hour to play.
[3901.66 - 3909.26] P:1724.64 E:0.143780 |  Benzemaak. Benzemaak scored the Real Madrid opening goal. Now Modric on the right hand side
[3909.26 - 3916.54] P:1670.75 E:0.149702 |  plays it back towards Nato behind him. Cross swings the ball out towards the left hand side
[3916.54 - 3920.94] P:1575.79 E:0.150984 |  where it's taken down and played forward to Ronaldo who's on the left hand side Ronaldo turns
[3921.02 - 3925.74] P:1661.45 E:0.152375 |  gives it back to Isco. Isco moving in from the left hand side a little past square
[3925.74 - 3931.74] P:1643.76 E:0.140584 |  Casamiro turns under pressure gives it to Modric. Modric sets himself and then drifts around Milner
[3931.74 - 3936.86] P:1743.07 E:0.146728 |  Modric still going. Nato now. Nato's ball across into the penalty go shut on the train from Isco
[3936.86 - 3941.18] P:1812.62 E:0.148639 |  and Carrios diving to his left as able to block it around the post. I don't think he needed the
[3941.18 - 3945.82] P:1699.10 E:0.140223 |  stadium. I think he was going wide I suppose after making a big mistake you can understand why he did
[3945.82 - 3951.82] P:1633.40 E:0.130675 |  decide to save it. There's a reaction save making a big conference corner nevertheless.
[3951.82 - 3959.34] P:1744.42 E:0.132847 |  One won the score. Cross to take it. The tall blonde-haired German with the out swinger towards
[3959.34 - 3964.86] P:1747.23 E:0.145359 |  the edge of towards the penalty spot that is headed away by Firmino for Liverpool. Cross had come back
[3964.86 - 3972.54] P:1838.03 E:0.150293 |  from an upside position and the flag went up with a push. Isco is substitution and it's Gareth Bale
[3972.54 - 3978.46] P:1772.30 E:0.133627 |  coming on for Real Madrid. It's not going to be Isco and it is Isco. So Gareth Bale
[3981.82 - 3988.78] P:1848.32 E:0.138507 |  runs onto the field to appear in a Champions League final for the fourth time which is the
[3989.50 - 3995.18] P:1687.91 E:0.146846 |  same number of Champions League finals that Ryan Giggs played in and on he comes. Isco's off gets
[3995.18 - 4000.46] P:1625.96 E:0.150098 |  a pat on the back from Zidane and Bale sends out a couple of instructions there. Well it looks like
[4000.46 - 4005.34] P:1566.47 E:0.154175 |  Bale's going to start on the right obviously and then cutting. They will be quite now because
[4005.34 - 4008.38] P:1534.93 E:0.163757 |  Ronaldo wants to play the left and the left he is not allowed to play on the left.
[4011.18 - 4017.58] P:1698.26 E:0.153626 |  Real Madrid won Liverpool won and Gareth Bale honors the substitute just as in Cardiff in the
[4017.58 - 4025.02] P:1830.52 E:0.142613 |  final last year when Real Madrid successfully defended the title. He also had a play for a twin
[4025.66 - 4028.06] P:1690.01 E:0.148746 |  to the holders halfway inside their own half.
[4030.54 - 4036.62] P:1747.03 E:0.133478 |  Taken by natural. Bale gets his first touch but behind him Robertson lifts the ball into the
[4036.62 - 4042.78] P:1723.36 E:0.133644 |  Real Madrid half then Varan stabs it away with his right foot. Vijn Elden's clearance
[4042.78 - 4049.10] P:1876.71 E:0.144875 |  pass forward is blocked by Croes and Lovren has to go back to his goalkeeper. Carriers behind him.
[4050.06 - 4055.98] P:1891.75 E:0.152274 |  Carriers just plays it with his right foot out to his right and then the blonde hair German goalkeeper
[4055.98 - 4060.94] P:1617.33 E:0.134311 |  long ball downfield onto the head of Varan. Modric picks up the loose ball in midfield
[4060.94 - 4065.90] P:1554.59 E:0.130855 |  and plays it to Marsello who's off on one of those marauding Marsello runs. He has Ronaldo
[4065.90 - 4069.58] P:1770.78 E:0.142653 |  out there with him as well. Ronaldo back to Marsello who tried to thread it through. There were
[4069.58 - 4074.70] P:1648.26 E:0.134448 |  three Liverpool players there though and it was blocked away towards the halfway line. Real Madrid
[4074.70 - 4084.38] P:1724.47 E:0.135743 |  will start again. Gareth Bale. His dark hair tied up on the back of his head. Bale to Modric
[4084.38 - 4092.38] P:1672.37 E:0.142560 |  and then Bale again passing it back into his own half and now Varan the tall Frenchman finds
[4092.38 - 4097.58] P:1566.71 E:0.150068 |  Modric on the right hand side here just makes a dart in front of where Zinedine Zidane the great
[4097.58 - 4103.66] P:1549.66 E:0.139504 |  Zidane who scored that brilliant goal in the final at Handen stands. Croes now out towards the left
[4103.66 - 4109.58] P:1753.70 E:0.130849 |  hand side where it's taken down by Ronaldo. Ronaldo drifting from left to right. Henderson puts in
[4109.58 - 4114.06] P:1698.97 E:0.138651 |  the final challenge so Ronaldo plays it back to Casamiro who plays it to his fellow Brazilian
[4114.06 - 4119.58] P:1817.41 E:0.152688 |  Marsello on the left hand side. Marsello is right footed ball and overhand kick it's in from Bale.
[4119.58 - 4125.42] P:1741.58 E:0.167624 |  What a goal! What a brilliant goal in the Champions League final from Gareth Bale and
[4125.42 - 4132.06] P:1734.05 E:0.165819 |  Real Madrid are back in front against Liverpool crushing for Liverpool but what a goal from
[4132.06 - 4136.54] P:1586.95 E:0.161784 |  Gareth Bale. You don't see him any better now what an occasion as well he's only been on the field
[4136.54 - 4142.70] P:1466.09 E:0.167650 |  five minutes he's had both four touches what a goal that is. Now when the ball comes in you think
[4142.70 - 4148.14] P:1653.69 E:0.162977 |  no danger he can't he's gonna maybe he's up to bring it down maybe flick it on next thing he's in the
[4148.14 - 4154.70] P:1647.10 E:0.164149 |  air well what a goal that is and what a substitution as well that Zinedine Zidane on at the right hand
[4154.70 - 4160.78] P:1699.36 E:0.143212 |  it's just it's just an absolute wonder goal this as Kristin oh you don't score from there apart from
[4160.78 - 4167.98] P:1713.90 E:0.141789 |  then look at that. It's like Ronaldo has given it's stunning but this is the Champions League final.
[4167.98 - 4173.82] P:1704.22 E:0.140485 |  What a goal yeah well how many seconds before that did I mention Zinedine Zidane's goal that he scored at
[4173.82 - 4180.14] P:1672.77 E:0.135966 |  Handan Park seven and that goal might be the end of the hall that goal is that goal is better better
[4180.14 - 4185.66] P:1619.25 E:0.137047 |  better better oh yeah you're not getting any better more difficult job more difficult you're not getting
[4185.66 - 4193.42] P:1705.57 E:0.143748 |  many better now look at the manager look at that wow what a reaction what a goal Zidane what a goal
[4193.42 - 4198.94] P:1721.90 E:0.140747 |  a man who scored that goal I mean that is a tribute in itself the way that Zidane would what do you
[4198.94 - 4204.54] P:1712.92 E:0.144783 |  call that you're sort of flicking his wrist isn't it and snapping his fingers. Liverpool used to do that
[4204.54 - 4210.30] P:1632.57 E:0.133062 |  one so yeah Terry McDonnell Terry might use to do that. You um the thing now is with Liverpool just
[4210.30 - 4216.46] P:1664.98 E:0.142274 |  just get back to playing again well we've had to come from a goal down once already in this final
[4216.46 - 4220.14] P:1594.09 E:0.132103 |  and you've got to look John differences in the bench as you know you bring bail on they can
[4220.14 - 4225.74] P:1546.40 E:0.135400 |  know they could you know they could bring a censor on but you look at the Liverpool how are you
[4225.74 - 4233.34] P:1584.72 E:0.155317 |  going to change it. Cool that therein lies the problem doesn't it for Liverpool is that the
[4233.34 - 4238.78] P:1595.11 E:0.160919 |  poor city in terms of the substitutions they look a bit dead you know when they come off the place
[4238.78 - 4242.86] P:1542.71 E:0.152008 |  now it's really hard for them not this and don't as well but they have come off the place but they're
[4242.86 - 4248.78] P:1605.59 E:0.154604 |  not on the pace Liverpool they're on the good no look at Rowan oh no Natios Natios wanted ahead of
[4248.78 - 4253.42] P:1700.48 E:0.138021 |  Robertson and now Robertson trying to recover against Bale but he is able to be that in the ball
[4253.42 - 4262.14] P:1754.00 E:0.136518 |  as that brought back to Carrius but it is Real Madrid 2 Liverpool 1 we have 25 minutes to play
[4262.22 - 4267.34] P:1667.79 E:0.149697 |  I think the Spanish radio station behind us is still finishing off the commentary on the
[4267.34 - 4271.58] P:1440.45 E:0.137444 |  Gallup Bill Gold. I think I still got that is an amazing goal but was it better than
[4271.58 - 4277.98] P:1641.46 E:0.146464 |  Ronaldo's at Juventus away? Not sure but I think given given the circumstances I know but
[4277.98 - 4283.02] P:1640.73 E:0.121491 |  if we're talking about a goal yeah it doesn't matter what ratchet is would you say I still think
[4283.02 - 4290.78] P:1597.95 E:0.137200 |  Ronaldo's might say that. I'm going for Bales I think the game does make a difference and he'd
[4291.26 - 4294.70] P:1680.54 E:0.142507 |  only had four touches how do you score when you've only had four touches?
[4294.70 - 4300.30] P:1743.57 E:0.133060 |  I just never wore one. Yeah obviously you couldn't need one now you know why. I mean the buzz is
[4300.30 - 4306.94] P:1830.28 E:0.131020 |  still going around the Kiev stadium the Liverpool supporters obviously disconsolate you know it can
[4306.94 - 4314.14] P:1751.14 E:0.130343 |  only shock you to concede a goal like that Marcelo what a contrast between the two goals
[4314.14 - 4320.38] P:1746.25 E:0.126195 |  that Real Madrid have scored. Football? How mad is football? Marcelo swinging the ball across
[4320.38 - 4326.62] P:1782.21 E:0.135507 |  it was Marcelo's cross but Bale had so much to do with his back to goal and got the perfect contact
[4327.18 - 4333.18] P:1740.16 E:0.151879 |  what was he 14 yards out 15 yards out? See the look on the goalkeeper's face it was how on earth
[4333.18 - 4338.14] P:1542.45 E:0.152927 |  did that happen? Man that's why he's right with the first goal. Well for very different reasons but
[4338.14 - 4344.62] P:1569.22 E:0.142452 |  he got the perfect contact Bale struck it so cleanly and it arched into the top corner of the net
[4345.58 - 4352.62] P:1778.66 E:0.136134 |  so two-one to Real Madrid and Garret Bale we saw him scoring the final in Lisbon but this was
[4352.62 - 4359.26] P:1667.10 E:0.133155 |  something else and Liverpool now are you watching it again? I'm watching it never he's not watching
[4359.26 - 4367.74] P:1815.64 E:0.127740 |  that. Never tired so almost midway through the second half it feels like we've just seen such a
[4368.94 - 4373.58] P:1607.24 E:0.147220 |  and it feels like at this side in moment it was such a good goal. Well I think Liverpool have gone
[4373.58 - 4380.94] P:1636.50 E:0.135261 |  flat John Anthony yet they have. It's like whoa how on earth do we react from that? However there
[4380.94 - 4386.14] P:1599.23 E:0.149406 |  is still only one goal in it Real Madrid leading Liverpool by two goals to one on five live and
[4386.14 - 4393.10] P:1599.96 E:0.142747 |  here's Alan Green to take you through to the 90 minutes. Liverpool look flattened it was a stunning
[4393.10 - 4403.42] P:1560.29 E:0.116125 |  goal from the watchman. Now can Liverpool respond? Here's Lovren. Lovren with Alexander Arnglund
[4403.42 - 4408.06] P:1720.74 E:0.146654 |  the far side but he hits it long looking for Manny and forces the defender to put the ball out of
[4408.06 - 4415.02] P:1725.79 E:0.119937 |  play it's a throw in to Liverpool a third the way inside the Real Madrid half and now that's a good
[4415.02 - 4422.14] P:1862.18 E:0.131127 |  ball to Lanallan that is offside though free kick to Real Madrid. It's not a bad ball to play though
[4422.14 - 4427.42] P:1840.27 E:0.139672 |  Alan because it just makes you think a little bit Madrid at the back you know don't push out so easily
[4427.42 - 4431.34] P:1701.43 E:0.129923 |  so give Liverpool a little bit more room to play in front of them. It's trying to find that energy
[4431.34 - 4436.38] P:1644.27 E:0.131129 |  don't mark in 20 minutes to go basically and it's it's hard you can see that they've run it with
[4436.38 - 4441.18] P:1728.15 E:0.131881 |  steam slightly and it's very hard for the team to press and press and Real Madrid's confidence
[4441.18 - 4446.94] P:1647.37 E:0.136473 |  are up removing the ball around very well. You know you can't keep revisiting them in the well can you?
[4446.94 - 4453.18] P:1704.29 E:0.151102 |  In the end it wins out. Here's Robertson playing the ball in towards Manny. Manny sir always had an
[4453.18 - 4458.70] P:1796.55 E:0.164131 |  un-goal goodness gracious from Arnglund. He looked at it for almost there put the ball into his own
[4458.70 - 4465.42] P:1785.70 E:0.133174 |  net it's behind for a corner but he actually did brilliantly Alan did brilliantly. He did brilliantly.
[4465.42 - 4469.98] P:1912.70 E:0.141829 |  Manny comes to him he's just got to dink it over the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper's a normal.
[4471.26 - 4477.82] P:1728.49 E:0.133736 |  The goalkeeper's allowed the place at both ends. Roberts is okay and it's a Liverpool corner
[4477.82 - 4481.82] P:1790.78 E:0.139880 |  from the left Milner to take it 21 minutes to go here in the Champions League final
[4481.82 - 4486.46] P:1853.24 E:0.137215 |  played in towards the far post. Punch clear by Navas it's going ahead to play in the far
[4486.46 - 4491.74] P:1816.93 E:0.142190 |  side of the field for another throw in to Liverpool. I keep sticking it in there by the way he will
[4491.74 - 4498.30] P:1598.13 E:0.122496 |  make another mistake him. Looking for Alan pulling on that Virgil van Dijk shirt. He sounds surprised Alan.
[4498.30 - 4503.98] P:1662.43 E:0.143887 |  Every time the ball goes in any box. What gets me is that referees do not clamp down in that.
[4503.98 - 4511.82] P:1697.26 E:0.134464 |  All season the Premier League it's ignored throwing taken goes to Manny. Manny switches
[4511.82 - 4516.46] P:1769.62 E:0.150307 |  the play when Alden just inside the penalty back to Manny. Manny on the left for John
[4516.46 - 4525.34] P:1812.69 E:0.160782 |  hits the post almost 2-2. This game is over. Manny for me has been excellent and I've got to say
[4525.34 - 4529.34] P:1734.96 E:0.150768 |  you know he's been a threat when he's on the left he came on the right he went quite a little bit
[4529.34 - 4533.58] P:1666.67 E:0.123381 |  before the time but second half I feel like he's going to get back in the game it's going to be
[4533.58 - 4538.94] P:1677.96 E:0.140534 |  a little bit of a salamow and wasn't it cutting in from the right left foot. 20 minutes to go
[4538.94 - 4543.66] P:1752.68 E:0.157909 |  you're seeing a five line to World Service and Radio Merseyside on the BBC. Stick it underneath
[4543.66 - 4548.94] P:1680.42 E:0.137413 |  the crossbar don't foul the goalkeeper. Milner right footed in towards the goalkeeper but
[4549.50 - 4554.38] P:1767.36 E:0.142880 |  that was well caught by Navas admittedly he wasn't under much pressure and he throws the ball
[4554.38 - 4558.06] P:1747.13 E:0.150647 |  out towards this side of the field. It's an awful throw and it's straight out of play.
[4558.06 - 4565.90] P:1802.13 E:0.137168 |  Modric is furious. Navas apologizes. Ramos is furious. They're all furious. Well I said when
[4565.90 - 4572.62] P:1629.63 E:0.131641 |  Salah had to go off I thought he was the quieter of the front three. I picked Manny ahead of from you
[4572.62 - 4582.54] P:1666.17 E:0.131134 |  know Manny's had a great game. Here's Rolana. Rolana on to Ronaldo. Ronaldo just jinxed into the right.
[4583.26 - 4590.94] P:1695.98 E:0.132409 |  Alexander-Arnold into Ronaldo again. Ronaldo has two Real players closing down on them now a third
[4590.94 - 4597.26] P:1819.62 E:0.131050 |  so he's forced to clear back to Lovren inside the Liverpool half. 26 minutes played in the second half.
[4597.26 - 4604.70] P:1885.44 E:0.142514 |  Real Madrid lead Liverpool by two goals to one the first Real goal presented by frankly a disgraceful
[4604.70 - 4611.98] P:1857.36 E:0.128614 |  error by Carrius. Absolutely appalling. He has shown some good form of late but there are many
[4611.98 - 4618.78] P:1618.31 E:0.131112 |  Liverpool fans who have convinced Liverpool need a new number one goalkeeper. Mignol is probably away
[4618.86 - 4625.18] P:1735.41 E:0.135849 |  in the summer as well. Here Liverpool bring it forward. Passed by Ronaldo took an important
[4625.18 - 4632.78] P:1747.88 E:0.136419 |  deflection off the Real player and now Real play it towards Modric. He's got De Bale to his right.
[4632.78 - 4638.06] P:1772.10 E:0.146544 |  He's played forward to Ronaldo instead. Benjamin is available. Ronaldo into the penalty. Ronaldo
[4638.06 - 4642.46] P:1865.76 E:0.146184 |  he's thought about going down there. He did think about going down and there wasn't a challenge on
[4642.46 - 4648.14] P:1649.50 E:0.152399 |  him. He just thought about going down. Typical Ronaldo as it is he won the ball behind for a goal
[4648.70 - 4653.58] P:1775.22 E:0.129500 |  kick. Yeah. And I did well. He slid in as though to make the challenge and just withdrew his foot
[4653.58 - 4657.50] P:1649.55 E:0.137156 |  and just threw my run. I think once he slid in I think Ronaldo then can I thought he's going to
[4657.50 - 4662.46] P:1784.46 E:0.144757 |  make contact but he's forced to clear up all he didn't. Here's Henderson to Alexander-Arne the ball
[4662.46 - 4669.10] P:1830.80 E:0.130125 |  still inside the Liverpool half. Henderson needs to rally his troops. Back it goes to Lovren and
[4669.10 - 4675.10] P:1521.43 E:0.122718 |  now Van Dijk. Look how far the pitch Robertson is. Liverpool aren't going to go out with a run
[4675.10 - 4683.02] P:1824.91 E:0.129929 |  for that for sure. No. Ball is back with Karius again and Karius forward to Henderson. Henderson
[4683.02 - 4687.10] P:1779.62 E:0.150162 |  was under a little bit of pressure there but Henderson plays the ball back to his goalkeeper
[4687.10 - 4692.94] P:1874.66 E:0.127503 |  once more. You're going to come yelling instructions from the edge of his technical area. There's a
[4692.94 - 4698.38] P:1736.86 E:0.140805 |  downside on the edge too. Ball breaks kindly for Ronaldo. Ronaldo manning through the middle for
[4698.38 - 4703.26] P:1759.15 E:0.156622 |  Manitou is right. Firmino crosses the ball. Kifra goes. Firmino shoots and then it's saved
[4703.26 - 4708.70] P:1826.69 E:0.165003 |  him anywhere I think. It was upside against Milano. I don't think it was that handball.
[4709.50 - 4714.70] P:1754.41 E:0.147010 |  It hit him. It hit his arm but he's so so close. So so close. I agree with you.
[4716.30 - 4721.90] P:1644.26 E:0.138578 |  Yeah he never moved his arm towards the ball. No chance. That was a great ball through the middle.
[4721.90 - 4727.26] P:1822.35 E:0.163520 |  Controlled immediately. I know. Here's Ronaldo could finish Liverpool off and he shoots it wide.
[4727.26 - 4732.38] P:1788.97 E:0.153320 |  What a tackle that is. What a tackle by Robertson. Absolutely sensational tackle.
[4733.50 - 4737.26] P:1670.47 E:0.141530 |  That should have been the end by the way. I always bend them all. I ball up down the middle
[4737.26 - 4741.82] P:1718.43 E:0.142520 |  and now where is the defence. Brilliant tackle this is. Yeah brilliant. My word.
[4743.42 - 4746.78] P:1706.51 E:0.144339 |  Do you know something? It's not a corner. I know it's not. It's not a corner
[4747.58 - 4753.42] P:1704.54 E:0.137448 |  because Robertson played the ball into Ronaldo's foot. What's that fifth official doing there?
[4753.42 - 4758.06] P:1700.68 E:0.153632 |  He's up to the goal. He's only two foot eight away. It's such a nice uniform. He's in the program.
[4758.78 - 4760.62] P:1752.53 E:0.150853 |  Yeah it's how much is it costing the program.
[4763.50 - 4769.18] P:1717.14 E:0.132783 |  Anyway corner to Real Madrid. It shouldn't have been. Real lead two one. 16 minutes of the
[4769.18 - 4774.86] P:1599.91 E:0.116327 |  rebounds to go. Real Madrid heading for a third successive Champions League title. Corner plate
[4774.86 - 4781.34] P:1694.40 E:0.117118 |  short. Marcello back to Modric. Marcello's available again. Left of the penalty here.
[4781.34 - 4786.14] P:1767.74 E:0.129926 |  He crosses high into the box. The header back by Ramos. Liverpool keep the pressure on.
[4786.22 - 4790.38] P:1757.73 E:0.136037 |  They might counter attack here. I'll tell you what it's a big intersection that by
[4790.38 - 4797.26] P:1732.02 E:0.141887 |  Nacho. It's a big intersection Alan. Liverpool are all away. Yeah he's given a free kick here
[4797.26 - 4803.26] P:1778.73 E:0.121643 |  against Alexander Arnal for the tackle on Nacho. Corti's foot, Corti, Nacho's left foot. Has it been
[4803.26 - 4807.82] P:1604.12 E:0.125540 |  a booking? No. No. Well he went to book Marnay when they started arguing about seeing it was an
[4807.82 - 4812.22] P:1604.35 E:0.145230 |  elbow he changed his move. Yeah I think he looked at Ramos and thought very high. How can they give
[4812.30 - 4816.94] P:1577.58 E:0.152237 |  a card? Very tackle on Ramos. Very high Liverpool. Not the space to put that ball in.
[4819.34 - 4824.46] P:1529.54 E:0.167052 |  Liverpool do not concede a third. Not with a quarter of an hour to go. I knew the problem is
[4824.46 - 4829.90] P:1653.07 E:0.143784 |  the goalkeeper looks like he's trying to come and rectify his mistake here. It's chipped in.
[4829.90 - 4834.62] P:1750.78 E:0.152122 |  Either flies up or offside immediately. There are at least two Real Madrid players offside.
[4835.66 - 4840.38] P:1796.14 E:0.137639 |  Free kick to Liverpool. Be careful what you do with it Karius.
[4842.38 - 4847.82] P:1862.02 E:0.139641 |  Karius had Benzema close to him again. I think that was such a schoolboy mistake.
[4847.82 - 4854.70] P:1831.00 E:0.128464 |  Oh it's just awful. It's just a howler. No that was Kirlis initially from Ronaldo and
[4854.70 - 4860.14] P:1804.33 E:0.139238 |  now Real have it on the far side of the field. Searching for the killer goal. Good tackle
[4860.14 - 4865.50] P:1714.35 E:0.144531 |  though by the Liverpool captain Henderson. Finds Alexander Arnal. He drives it forward for
[4865.50 - 4869.58] P:1719.67 E:0.132547 |  Benzema. Certainly barged into Ramos. That should have been a free kick. It wasn't given.
[4871.50 - 4875.10] P:1828.87 E:0.147357 |  It's handball against Rolando. Was it handballed?
[4877.82 - 4881.82] P:1652.98 E:0.146001 |  We're a long way away. Really really quickly as well wasn't it? Trying to pinch it.
[4883.50 - 4890.06] P:1683.80 E:0.142837 |  You're in the clock. Yeah concern. Stick or twist time. What does he do? Well he's got nothing really
[4890.06 - 4897.10] P:1730.77 E:0.140465 |  to throw on. Well he could throw on Salanki. Yeah well you go a little bit kind of
[4897.66 - 4904.38] P:1571.11 E:0.136652 |  root oneish. Yeah maybe put Toklalana in behind. The front three we'll see. Anyway it's a Real
[4904.38 - 4909.18] P:1658.51 E:0.122209 |  Madrid free kick which has been rather wasted. When Albus passed back to Alexander Arnal wasn't
[4909.18 - 4914.30] P:1640.46 E:0.130009 |  great though. He finds Firmino in towards Ronaldo again. That was a loose pass by the Brazilian.
[4914.38 - 4919.26] P:1764.13 E:0.155745 |  Moderate takes it up. Firmino wins it back. Ball inside the centre so it goes with Lallana.
[4920.06 - 4925.26] P:1801.65 E:0.132078 |  That tackle by Firmino. Encourages the Liverpool fans. Now it's with Robertson. Back to the captain
[4925.26 - 4932.22] P:1967.88 E:0.135702 |  Henderson. Henderson to Lovren. Lovren takes it further forward. Ronaldo turns and runs away from
[4932.22 - 4937.66] P:1894.09 E:0.144398 |  Cruz. Good ball to Milner. Left edge of the fender. No cross in goodness. That hadn't been cleared
[4937.66 - 4942.62] P:1802.37 E:0.145824 |  by Varan. Lallana was there. But Liverpool have a throw in on the near side of the field.
[4942.62 - 4949.26] P:1757.99 E:0.121741 |  Great position in Varan as well to clear the cross. Throne back to Robertson. Now Van Dijk
[4949.82 - 4954.70] P:1598.32 E:0.133260 |  to Henderson. Real Madrid have got everybody back behind the ball apart from Ronaldo. There's
[4954.70 - 4960.14] P:1725.23 E:0.137446 |  the cross into their penalty area headed away. Lovren meets the head of clearance. Taps it back
[4960.14 - 4967.66] P:1755.54 E:0.119931 |  to Henderson. Square pass to the left of Van Dijk and on to Robertson. Robertson will want to attack
[4967.66 - 4975.34] P:1727.84 E:0.142350 |  at every possible opportunity. Henderson forward to Milner. Milner tackled. That was a dive by
[4975.34 - 4980.62] P:1737.91 E:0.143619 |  Nacho. Rightly ignored by the referee but he should have avoided it. Yeah, as soon as he saw the
[4980.62 - 4987.42] P:1701.07 E:0.114765 |  referee was giving nothing he was on his feet. Well they all do it. Now Firmino. Good play by
[4987.42 - 4991.98] P:1659.92 E:0.149579 |  the Brazilian. Holding off a challenge. Taps the pass forward. Milner level with the edge of the
[4991.98 - 4996.62] P:1665.58 E:0.142612 |  Real Madrid penalty. It checks under his right foot. Where is the ball going though? He's tackled
[4996.62 - 5002.06] P:1797.32 E:0.143086 |  by Modric. Birch. Challenge and now Cruz. Clears it. Straight to Liverpool's possession once more.
[5002.06 - 5007.18] P:1725.16 E:0.158829 |  Alexander-Arnold on the far side of the field. 13 minutes to go plus added time. Real Madrid lead
[5007.18 - 5012.94] P:1714.68 E:0.125940 |  2-1. Alexander-Arnold passes forward. Took a deflection off a Real player. Didn't reach Firmino
[5012.94 - 5018.46] P:1650.85 E:0.121976 |  properly and Marcelo with the clearance to the captain on the far side. I said the captain.
[5018.46 - 5023.90] P:1794.86 E:0.152240 |  Ronaldo, he acts like the captain. You know it's me, me, me all the time. Here's Milner.
[5024.54 - 5031.26] P:1740.80 E:0.125888 |  Milner back to Ronaldo. Onto Manny. Liverpool's best player in the night. Manny runs away from
[5031.26 - 5037.50] P:1811.10 E:0.122858 |  one tackle. Can't beat the second tackle. Manny's gone down at the moment. I think he's okay.
[5039.02 - 5044.70] P:1761.64 E:0.143823 |  But Real have the ball. Run forward by Bayer which is completely ignored by Cruz. Well I think he
[5044.70 - 5049.42] P:1796.15 E:0.131554 |  started the pass. I think he started. He was just shifting the ball from foot to foot and he just
[5049.42 - 5058.62] P:1630.86 E:0.121386 |  didn't have that split second to deliver it. Casemiro to Cruz. And back to Ramos. Ramos who may
[5058.62 - 5065.18] P:1638.62 E:0.142751 |  well be lifting the Champions League trophy for the third season in succession. 32th time at all
[5065.18 - 5072.54] P:1744.46 E:0.147651 |  for Real Madrid. Are they in the better side? Yes, actually probably over the course of the play now.
[5073.34 - 5079.10] P:1625.93 E:0.145428 |  They have but I mean how mad is it that the first goal is given to them and the second goal is an
[5079.10 - 5086.78] P:1625.15 E:0.123313 |  absolute worthy. There's 35 minutes I thought Liverpool were good. Better side, looked the more
[5086.78 - 5092.62] P:1639.67 E:0.121325 |  likely to score and then they sort of come off the pace. I think they're looking for fans need to
[5092.62 - 5097.66] P:1660.35 E:0.136798 |  find another course. Have you never walked alone at the moment? Many of them are in despair. A way
[5097.66 - 5105.66] P:1780.64 E:0.139262 |  to a left. I don't think Liverpool may have exploited the flank. They've got in great areas
[5105.66 - 5111.98] P:1863.64 E:0.152537 |  in order to make them be there but the second half, it's all played men for. They're on the good
[5111.98 - 5117.50] P:1679.42 E:0.150100 |  dunk track, the full box. They let them run and they've not exploited it. They turn around to Ramos
[5117.50 - 5123.74] P:1489.80 E:0.149255 |  and quickly play forward to Cruz. Cruz just showed a halfway line. Good ball to the left side. Ronaldo,
[5124.54 - 5130.62] P:1738.30 E:0.142399 |  Bales well to the unmarked. Ball is back with Marcelo on the Real right. One-two played by
[5130.62 - 5136.78] P:1622.59 E:0.146742 |  Marcelo and then he gets the ball wide to Ronaldo again. I think Real are just happy to retain
[5136.78 - 5140.62] P:1637.07 E:0.148694 |  possession at the moment. They're the good of it Alan. Yeah they are good. They're going to do,
[5140.62 - 5146.06] P:1465.22 E:0.151311 |  get in front, keep the ball, invite the foul. Liverpool not hurting them at the moment. Moggish
[5146.06 - 5151.18] P:1610.91 E:0.140526 |  tries to turn the ball into the path of the Welshman but hits Robertson and it's out of play for
[5151.18 - 5156.06] P:1548.35 E:0.132826 |  throwing no one in any great urgency to take it. A little bit of an absence of clot at the moment
[5156.06 - 5160.14] P:1657.68 E:0.131187 |  on the touch line. It's going to be a shame. I wonder if he's having a chat with the coach and
[5160.14 - 5166.38] P:1625.80 E:0.129118 |  staff on what he's going to do next. Inside the last 10 minutes of the regular 90. Here's Ramos.
[5167.10 - 5171.58] P:1718.82 E:0.141858 |  Mani puts him under pressure. Ramos just got the ball back to his goalkeeper Navas
[5172.14 - 5177.10] P:1712.19 E:0.138217 |  and Navas now he swings his right foot and directs it towards Garret Bear, beaten in the air by Van
[5177.10 - 5185.50] P:1684.66 E:0.127324 |  Dijk but the judge runs to Nacho. No, Moggish. And do Casamiro and that's a loose pass by Casamiro
[5185.50 - 5191.26] P:1752.41 E:0.127375 |  but Milner unfortunately for Liverpool slipped and couldn't intercept properly. Now it's with
[5191.26 - 5198.06] P:1735.10 E:0.141922 |  Bale. Ronaldo through the middle. Arlval often the far side with Benjamin. Benjamin should save by
[5198.06 - 5203.02] P:1732.08 E:0.149801 |  Carrius. What a sensational pass by Bale. Unbelievable by the way.
[5208.22 - 5213.82] P:1668.17 E:0.152076 |  Well Carrius I don't think can quite make up for his error that led to the first real goal but he's
[5213.82 - 5220.14] P:1752.14 E:0.130295 |  trying hard throwing to Ray on the dribble on the far side of the field. It's with Benzema.
[5220.86 - 5224.94] P:1578.12 E:0.144803 |  Benzema to the left of the whole penalty here. Knocks it back to Marcello and that's Cruz.
[5225.50 - 5230.38] P:1809.27 E:0.131363 |  Marcello wants more. Liverpool can't get the ball. Yeah the other thing is all of a
[5230.38 - 5234.38] P:1865.25 E:0.134132 |  soon when you're starting to run backwards you don't all start to feel tired.
[5235.10 - 5242.22] P:1803.38 E:0.145764 |  John all that pressure Liverpool applied in the first half. No, Mani may well be the first car.
[5242.22 - 5247.98] P:1824.05 E:0.142180 |  Milner, yeah it is. Yeah Mani, Milner's just going through the crump. I saw Robin's car before.
[5248.94 - 5257.26] P:1730.02 E:0.140347 |  Oh Ramos again. Kelce, please. Here comes Emery Shan. No he's not coming. I'll go away please.
[5257.26 - 5265.98] P:1832.85 E:0.135031 |  He's getting a game done away with. Well Ramos waited. How do you know something? Why? The way he
[5265.98 - 5278.06] P:1945.54 E:0.148121 |  reacted was a disgrace Ramos. A yellow card for Mani and Emery Shan with his last minutes
[5278.62 - 5284.30] P:1648.49 E:0.131622 |  in a Liverpool shirt. Right so let's try and see what they're going to do now. Push one out of them over
[5284.30 - 5289.74] P:1711.17 E:0.150128 |  on the right a little bit. That'll be the same. Please just take one last push. But there's almost
[5289.74 - 5294.22] P:1711.01 E:0.150724 |  there's almost three of them holding hands there in midfield. Eight minutes plus out of time remaining
[5294.22 - 5300.30] P:1757.96 E:0.139349 |  here. Here's Real Madrid lead Liverpool by two goals to one. Here's Bale shooting from one way.
[5300.30 - 5307.98] P:1752.49 E:0.169165 |  What a mistake by Carrius. The ball hit directly to him and that is the end of Carrius as Liverpool's
[5307.98 - 5313.82] P:1672.01 E:0.166420 |  number one goalkeeper. That is a shocking error and Real Madrid lead two. Well there's no excuse
[5313.82 - 5320.46] P:1592.11 E:0.175223 |  and even if the ball moved a little bit in the air even if it moved his position in terms of his
[5320.46 - 5327.58] P:1549.03 E:0.174419 |  hands it was just nowhere near it. It kind of went through him completely. Yeah well Bale laid
[5327.58 - 5331.90] P:1513.97 E:0.174834 |  himself up and he does have a good shot. He's got to say he does have moves a lot. What did you say
[5331.90 - 5337.02] P:1616.03 E:0.163422 |  at that level? Just punch it away. Just keep it out of the net Chris. Ninety nine and a half times out
[5337.02 - 5343.74] P:1627.69 E:0.147119 |  of a hundred. You're saying that for fun. Bale's second goal of the game. His first was fantastic.
[5343.74 - 5349.50] P:1645.24 E:0.144992 |  His second and not his fault. No. Another goalkeeper mistake. He's hit it well by the way.
[5349.58 - 5355.74] P:1680.16 E:0.138769 |  He's come and saved. What is he 30 yards? It moves with a goalie. Oh. Why is he seeing a replay?
[5355.74 - 5362.30] P:1569.91 E:0.134509 |  It's a shocker. Why is the goalie falling to the ground? I really don't know. Oh my goodness.
[5363.18 - 5372.54] P:1672.67 E:0.151203 |  Patikake. Patikake. Baker's man on it. Tiro. Oh no. Well for so long Mille-Aix looked perhaps the
[5372.54 - 5379.10] P:1707.99 E:0.142837 |  better option for Carrius. Then Carrius got the number one vote from Jürgen Klopp. Now he's shown
[5379.18 - 5384.86] P:1739.15 E:0.140591 |  twice tonight that he ain't good enough. He's a goer as Liverpool's goalkeeper. He was actually
[5384.86 - 5392.30] P:1772.03 E:0.145603 |  watching the replay on the big screen opposite end. It's surely beyond Liverpool night. They must
[5392.30 - 5398.70] P:1729.36 E:0.147195 |  know that particularly with the clotting goal. Oh there he goes. Here's Kacke. Kacke goes on for a
[5398.70 - 5403.66] P:1764.51 E:0.157477 |  hat trick. Failing to the penalty area. Brilliant tackle. Ronaldo's asking for the pass. Should have
[5403.66 - 5407.74] P:1748.67 E:0.138254 |  played Ronaldo. I'm sure they've gone over. What are you on a hat trick? You know, he's got very
[5407.74 - 5412.22] P:1738.05 E:0.141836 |  excited there, didn't he? Yeah. And his last touch was like the heaviest touch he's had since he's
[5412.22 - 5416.38] P:1607.42 E:0.143376 |  been on the pitch. He goes past Henderson. Oh that's heavy, wasn't it? Loveburn does well with
[5416.38 - 5425.42] P:1633.98 E:0.145235 |  him. Very good. Great tackle by Loveburn. Put Loveburn in goal. Yeah, exactly. There's a Liverpool
[5425.42 - 5430.38] P:1650.39 E:0.161598 |  goalkeeper. I don't think he's shown tonight that both his hands are useless.
[5433.18 - 5439.50] P:1603.09 E:0.156144 |  How did you come back from this as well? You can't come back from this. Liverpool fans that in their
[5439.50 - 5445.42] P:1656.62 E:0.133998 |  despair tonight will be laughing at the very thought that Carrius is their number one goalkeeper.
[5445.42 - 5450.62] P:1603.02 E:0.146550 |  I don't think he's been playing all that. Sorry? Everybody said, oh great he's been the last three
[5451.18 - 5457.98] P:1593.02 E:0.137480 |  months. Improved. Better. Improved. That's all. Remember the shot from Roma where he left
[5457.98 - 5464.70] P:1591.27 E:0.150534 |  through his hands and hit the cross one, came out and that was at 0-0. No, just another corner.
[5464.70 - 5469.10] P:1575.17 E:0.144586 |  It just takes the wind out yourselves. Look at Liverpool. Look at them body language. Absolutely.
[5469.10 - 5476.22] P:1582.43 E:0.156746 |  Just completely. For example, very young Liverpool fans in tears. They're shielding their eyes.
[5476.46 - 5481.66] P:1326.14 E:0.160345 |  They can't believe that, you know, they'd be playing with a goalkeeper behind them and a
[5481.66 - 5489.26] P:1479.07 E:0.154273 |  schoolboy team who would make such mistakes. The ball is behind. It's a goal kick to Liverpool.
[5490.06 - 5497.98] P:1426.73 E:0.154241 |  Four minutes to go. Real Madrid fans can't believe they're good fortune tonight in having,
[5498.54 - 5504.46] P:1379.67 E:0.131798 |  in effect, two goals scored by the Liverpool goalkeeper. Yeah, mind you, the one that did score
[5504.46 - 5510.38] P:1459.58 E:0.136282 |  was worth it. Oh, it was wonderful. No denying that at all. Henderson, on towards Fremina,
[5511.02 - 5515.34] P:1576.58 E:0.147664 |  tackled by Casimiro and now it's with Ronaldo on the far side of the field. He rushes to keep
[5515.34 - 5522.94] P:1690.17 E:0.145522 |  it in play. He's sleeping. Ronaldo hasn't scored a goal tonight. He's tackled there and beaten
[5524.06 - 5530.30] P:1609.48 E:0.138067 |  and Alexander-Arnold just to the right of his penalty area. It's a 4-2 Ronaldo and now
[5530.38 - 5534.30] P:1663.72 E:0.151847 |  managed lockdown by Marcelo. Clever foul, isn't it? Again, this is what we talk about.
[5534.94 - 5538.70] P:1635.65 E:0.131510 |  Miles from your own goal. Bring him down. Ways 25-30 seconds.
[5540.86 - 5547.66] P:1616.96 E:0.133864 |  A little over three minutes to go. Plus added time. But not remotely enough. This is not Barcelona in
[5547.66 - 5557.26] P:1617.43 E:0.127774 |  1999 when United trailed 1-0 going into added time. Silver spirit defined two added time goals
[5557.26 - 5562.14] P:1617.91 E:0.141128 |  to win the European Cup under Seraldox Ferguson. Liverpool look totally deflated tonight.
[5563.02 - 5568.78] P:1634.24 E:0.143835 |  Two goals behind. There's no coming back from this. Now, here's Henderson just over the halfway line.
[5569.66 - 5576.54] P:1647.47 E:0.157366 |  Henderson to Schaen and Schaen to Ronaldo. Still find out a very strange substitution.
[5576.54 - 5580.70] P:1562.58 E:0.150629 |  Bring Henry Schaen on. Once the lanky's on the bench. Well, he's just brought down with two
[5580.70 - 5586.14] P:1647.93 E:0.141878 |  light players, hasn't he? There's a cross into the Real penalty area. It's headed away. There's a
[5586.14 - 5595.18] P:1704.34 E:0.132021 |  foul. He had a look. Is it Nacho? Yeah, Fumio was a bit late. He's frustrated. You can see that.
[5595.18 - 5599.66] P:1688.86 E:0.141242 |  But Nacho had a look at the referee. Is there going to be a sensio coming on? Is it for
[5600.38 - 5603.42] P:1721.47 E:0.132957 |  Benzema? Will he take Ronaldo off? He won't take Rony off.
[5606.78 - 5614.06] P:1770.04 E:0.149743 |  Well, a sensio is coming off and he's coming on for Benzema.
[5615.02 - 5621.42] P:1805.24 E:0.164398 |  I thought it might have been. The sulk would have been enormous.
[5624.46 - 5631.18] P:1858.38 E:0.156681 |  Yeah, you don't take Norisco offending Ronaldo. Not unless you're absolutely sure that his career
[5631.18 - 5636.38] P:1847.25 E:0.154832 |  is on the dome. So it's funny that you talk about what happened. I don't know if you thought it
[5636.38 - 5641.42] P:1847.59 E:0.151580 |  was me at the stakes, but the game basically has done a little to a first 35 minutes before.
[5642.22 - 5646.06] P:1832.25 E:0.139921 |  Get yourselves in front. You've got a chance. They didn't. I really came back in the game after
[5646.06 - 5652.14] P:1633.60 E:0.151905 |  the outpot then. Real Madrid was all over XB in 65-70 minutes. Take control of the game. Knowledge,
[5652.14 - 5657.50] P:1619.32 E:0.143318 |  basically. We always said, I think, at the start of the game, not back in ourselves,
[5657.50 - 5662.62] P:1710.36 E:0.140468 |  but Liverpool to win needed to score the first goal. I think that was definitely key to this game.
[5662.62 - 5669.74] P:1697.18 E:0.137001 |  But Manny, having scored so soon after Real Madrid, took the lead while it might just have opened
[5669.82 - 5676.46] P:1765.94 E:0.142082 |  up for Liverpool. Maybe it was the psychological blow of losing Salah after 29 minutes of the game.
[5677.02 - 5680.06] P:1529.40 E:0.154984 |  Or maybe the fact that a goalkeeper was absolutely hopeless.
[5680.06 - 5683.18] P:1467.06 E:0.170440 |  And it could have been playing with 10 men there tonight. Liverpool wouldn't be much
[5683.18 - 5691.74] P:1543.92 E:0.155413 |  worse off. And I'm sure Minule, I've seen interviews with Minule and he's far too nice a guy to take
[5691.74 - 5699.42] P:1595.35 E:0.129571 |  any pleasure and carry his discomfort. But would he have been any worse Minule? It's
[5699.42 - 5704.86] P:1717.36 E:0.132209 |  chipped forward towards Manny. Manny into the penalty area. Well covered though by Ramos,
[5704.86 - 5709.58] P:1764.09 E:0.136884 |  the Real captain. And then Manny went the ball back and he's fouled. And it's a free kick
[5710.46 - 5716.06] P:1750.67 E:0.142441 |  to Liverpool. I know we've started Ramos off and say, you know, he's a clever professional.
[5716.06 - 5719.34] P:1516.68 E:0.132999 |  He's been good tonight. Very, very clever. He's been good though. Very clever.
[5719.66 - 5727.02] P:1705.15 E:0.123631 |  So Liverpool have a free kick, which Alexander-Arnold will swing in. He's come across to the
[5727.02 - 5731.90] P:1655.39 E:0.131585 |  near side of the field. Fourth official ready to tell us how many minutes they're being added on.
[5731.90 - 5735.02] P:1693.54 E:0.120660 |  I've added time. I don't think it matters. But it's three.
[5738.30 - 5742.86] P:1658.82 E:0.129018 |  Alexander-Arnold, six yards in from the Liverpool left touch line.
[5742.86 - 5750.22] P:1738.91 E:0.123527 |  Not far in advance of the front edge of the penalty area. Swings in towards the fire post,
[5750.22 - 5756.38] P:1791.26 E:0.128054 |  headed down. The lamb is there. His was a weak shot and it's taken away by Modric.
[5757.02 - 5762.46] P:1713.23 E:0.128400 |  And Modric clears it. Well, the way Juventus played, I did the final last year in Cardiff,
[5762.46 - 5767.74] P:1783.19 E:0.129225 |  the way Juventus played in the first half, four-one flattered Real Madrid. I just hope
[5767.74 - 5772.30] P:1649.65 E:0.134419 |  now they don't score a fourth goal. I can't see the clinic where they've got his two.
[5772.94 - 5778.78] P:1606.95 E:0.149786 |  He's basically kept what a goal. Mistaken, obviously. But it's just that they have a
[5778.78 - 5782.62] P:1501.79 E:0.153860 |  style of playing, don't they? And you think, oh, they look rattled. They look slow. They're not
[5782.62 - 5787.26] P:1426.62 E:0.146131 |  got anything going for them. But the person would be able to keep that ball moving, keep the ball
[5787.26 - 5794.38] P:1608.76 E:0.132923 |  moving. Yeah. Here's Shad. Wins. Two tackles. Ball breaks back to an alder, but he can't control it.
[5794.46 - 5798.14] P:1590.38 E:0.136717 |  He decided to play and soft for an alder. It's going to be a throw into Real Madrid on the far
[5798.14 - 5804.14] P:1579.88 E:0.128769 |  side of the field. It's an unbelievable achievement in today's modern football to win this thing three
[5804.14 - 5809.74] P:1647.22 E:0.135969 |  years, right? Yes, right now. Fully agree. And Zidane, the first coach to win three in success.
[5810.86 - 5816.06] P:1627.77 E:0.141880 |  Wonderful achievement. And still, some Real Madrid fans aren't convinced. Real on the attack.
[5816.06 - 5820.38] P:1679.81 E:0.137644 |  He's played in towards Ronaldo and that was the vital interception by Van Dijk.
[5820.46 - 5825.90] P:1718.26 E:0.131316 |  Ascensio, what a ball. What a ball. What a throwing. What a throw. It was a three ball.
[5828.94 - 5836.38] P:1574.83 E:0.148531 |  Corner to Real Madrid. We played half of the additional time. What do you say if you're the
[5836.38 - 5842.62] P:1458.14 E:0.158644 |  manager to the goalkeeper? Good guy. It's almost impossible, isn't it? Yeah. I don't know how you
[5842.62 - 5847.98] P:1507.64 E:0.147911 |  can say anything that could console him without the goalkeeper knowing that he's finished his
[5847.98 - 5860.38] P:1347.66 E:0.130352 |  Liverpool's number one. He must be on his way. After the Brazilian goalkeeper at Roma, allegedly,
[5862.22 - 5865.18] P:1677.03 E:0.158915 |  and yet, thinking all those goals that Liverpool scored against Roma.
[5869.26 - 5875.26] P:1502.83 E:0.144569 |  There must be many schoolboy goalkeepers better than Karius. Here's Henderson. Henderson plays
[5875.26 - 5880.62] P:1655.58 E:0.141960 |  it towards the left side. Liverpool player, apparently injured on maybe it's just a bit
[5880.62 - 5887.18] P:1730.83 E:0.147155 |  of cramp on the far side of the field. Robertson was well tackled. Real on the counter attack.
[5887.18 - 5892.06] P:1739.32 E:0.149382 |  And now it's with Ronaldo. Down the right side. Great first attack. There's a fan on the pitch
[5892.06 - 5897.42] P:1703.78 E:0.148201 |  at the moment. Inside the penalty where Ronaldo is. Ronaldo shoots and what is going on? Some
[5898.06 - 5904.70] P:1906.78 E:0.165900 |  village of lost an idiot. Well, I don't know who he represents, but he's entirely wrong.
[5906.54 - 5912.22] P:1800.74 E:0.141165 |  Thankfully, he's not wearing a Liverpool red shirt, but I can't tell who he supports. He won
[5912.22 - 5918.94] P:1665.06 E:0.139078 |  a 19 key. Have clinic, would you? Stroke jam. Maybe the night will be a year. There is the final
[5918.94 - 5926.70] P:1707.55 E:0.167012 |  whistle. The referee's had enough. Liverpool had enough. And Real Madrid are champions of Europe
[5926.70 - 5932.62] P:1648.34 E:0.158903 |  for the 13th time. No one can deny their pedigree. Liverpool certainly matched them
[5932.62 - 5940.22] P:1723.67 E:0.147965 |  with the first half for 35 minutes. They were the better side. But Real fans celebrate and Liverpool
[5940.22 - 5946.30] P:1755.31 E:0.153574 |  fans, the majority of fans inside the stadium can't emphasize that enough. Two thirds Liverpool
[5946.30 - 5952.38] P:1423.41 E:0.160240 |  for one third Real Madrid. And they're looking at Karius and thinking, what on earth have we got?
[5952.86 - 5958.70] P:1529.52 E:0.160610 |  One of the Liverpool outfield players has gone to the goalkeeper. That tells you all you need to
[5958.70 - 5966.06] P:1526.83 E:0.155086 |  know. What on earth would you say to him? For goodness sake. I mean, I feel really, really sorry
[5966.06 - 5971.90] P:1620.41 E:0.144029 |  for him. And I think the second, the second era was worse than the first area. The second era is
[5971.90 - 5976.70] P:1785.27 E:0.154453 |  we'd all would have stopped that. Yeah, but he doesn't need to do anything. No. He thinks somebody
[5976.70 - 5981.58] P:1618.68 E:0.164268 |  would go up, son. Well, that tells you, listen, every, every trick he tells the story. Why don't
[5981.58 - 5985.98] P:1500.55 E:0.163745 |  the players go, look, he's made mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes. And I don't want him
[5985.98 - 5992.38] P:1513.04 E:0.167229 |  going for me. But Real Madrid players who've gone to Karius. Thank you very much. Thank you very,
[5992.38 - 6000.46] P:1684.32 E:0.153610 |  very, very much. Dear, oh dear. Still, no Liverpool player has gone towards Karius.
[6001.42 - 6006.22] P:1659.14 E:0.138766 |  That Lovren is the nearest one. All right, a member of the Liverpool back post,
[6006.22 - 6013.90] P:1748.25 E:0.161417 |  asking to put his arm around him. No, Karius is crying. But there's no comeback from that.
[6013.90 - 6020.54] P:1745.90 E:0.149840 |  There is no comeback from that. As a player, but no, but I mean, you know, and as much as
[6020.54 - 6026.06] P:1694.72 E:0.153373 |  Scott will say about him, they look after him and everything like that. You hit the nail on the head
[6026.06 - 6031.18] P:1716.72 E:0.145699 |  before, and the crowd won't have it. No, the Liverpool supporters just, they just didn't
[6031.18 - 6035.02] P:1759.88 E:0.152455 |  will not have him. To be honest, it's a bit like Emory Schoen being brought on the substitute.
[6035.02 - 6040.22] P:1676.17 E:0.144746 |  Well, I think that's different. I don't think that any Liverpool fan would have appreciated that.
[6041.02 - 6045.10] P:1749.08 E:0.141936 |  Well, no, they wouldn't have appreciated it. But unfortunately, what's happened to the goalkeeper,
[6045.90 - 6052.62] P:1621.15 E:0.135654 |  you cannot, you cannot be at the club and come back from that. It is absolutely impossible,
[6052.70 - 6058.94] P:1705.97 E:0.140572 |  I'm afraid. I feel really, really sorry for him. But it was too rid, well, it was schoolboy Howard,
[6058.94 - 6065.98] P:1607.27 E:0.134882 |  you cannot describe them as any other way. Liverpool players are mostly dying on the pitch at the moment.
[6067.18 - 6075.18] P:1836.30 E:0.143302 |  It has not been Liverpool's life. There's no question. This is 1981. We visited, that's the last
[6075.18 - 6082.30] P:1794.10 E:0.143689 |  European Cup stroke Champions League final that Real Madrid lost. Alan Kennedy scored the only
[6082.30 - 6088.94] P:1814.36 E:0.147396 |  goal that night. But tonight, it's Real Madrid's win. And you have to say that on the balance of
[6088.94 - 6097.58] P:1756.13 E:0.141288 |  play over the 90 plus minutes, they deserve it. Yeah. And clots on amongst all the players, some of
[6097.58 - 6103.34] P:1804.68 E:0.151142 |  the other substitutes, generally all the players who played in the game. I don't think he's gone over
[6103.34 - 6111.98] P:1865.84 E:0.155757 |  to the goalkeeper. How can you be sincere? Well, controlling the keeper in these second stages.
[6112.86 - 6116.22] P:1771.63 E:0.157379 |  That's the point that I'm trying to make. It's what do you do?
[6118.06 - 6125.02] P:1813.93 E:0.149930 |  And it's unfortunate that the goalkeeper has almost become a bigger talking point as an
[6125.02 - 6131.50] P:1768.62 E:0.150370 |  absolutely wonderful goal from Gareth Baird. Absolutely brilliant it was, nothing short of.
[6132.22 - 6137.90] P:1753.43 E:0.144860 |  A couple of the Liverpool substitutes have gone up night towards Carrier. So see Danny Yings in the
[6137.90 - 6146.38] P:1605.59 E:0.134641 |  vicinity. Jürgen Klopp still hasn't made his way on the pitch. Oclet Chamberlain. They would have missed
[6146.38 - 6150.78] P:1567.43 E:0.151544 |  the player that came tonight. I think if you look at the team and you look at the game now,
[6152.14 - 6157.10] P:1675.51 E:0.152487 |  first 35 minutes, I thought everybody was on the game and looked good for Liverpool.
[6157.74 - 6161.50] P:1709.94 E:0.159775 |  And obviously Salah goes off, but if you actually look at the game overall, I thought the back four
[6161.50 - 6167.50] P:1698.25 E:0.147590 |  was done alright. I think the back four did okay. And I think Marnier was Liverpool's best player
[6167.50 - 6173.34] P:1779.50 E:0.137709 |  for me by males. And I think the back four in Marnier can really say they played up to their
[6173.34 - 6178.54] P:1770.65 E:0.142181 |  level which had been played. It's finished. Liverpool won Real Madrid 3.
