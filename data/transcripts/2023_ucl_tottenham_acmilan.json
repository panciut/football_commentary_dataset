  "transcript": " When we look at these attacking options for Tottenham, Michael, does Conte's rigidity in sticking to 3-4-3 mean that he can't get the best out of Son, Kane and Richarlison? I think that's always the talking point, isn't it? If you get the extra midfield player in, you play it as a 2 at the top, how do you get all of these front players to have so much choice? Cool as F's keep us with the wider one, we've seen Lucas Mora coming in doing it with Richarlison. They've got a lot, haven't they? The one name we do know is always at the top of it, is obviously Harry Kane. If you have another one in the middle of the pitch, you could bring Son on if he's going to play in a 2, so there's many ways to actually make that improvement. But it's just again, it's collectively as a group keeps making the problems. I just don't know where it's going to end up, but I still look as well as because the appointment of Conte, and I know I'm going back to it so many times, is because it was on a short-term type level. You never seem to know what the future brings, so I had the question of the manager when he's not going to be there for the next two or three years, other clubs you sort of go, well, he's here for such a long time. I'm still trying to work out and I don't get why the inconsistent levels there, especially with those type of front players as well, there should be scoring more. About a month ago on a match of the day two, and I can't remember the pundit they did here, might have been Matthew Upton, said it's not far off a thankless task to be in a midfield too for Tottenham. It must be really difficult to be in a two in that midfield. It's the hardest position on the pitch, that's for sure, it's a midfield area, Strikers have it easy, they don't have to do any man hearing off, so it's a two at this level, very difficult. Would you change their formation, Chris? Do you want me to comment on that petty comment from Michael at all? No, rise above it, Chris, rise above it. I will, no, I... You're better than that. Well, I'm not. No, you know what, I think it is really difficult for, you know, it'll be difficult for Skippen and Hoybear this evening, you know, that they are often outnumbered, they are exposed. But what do we know about Antonio Conte, he's a stickler, he doesn't care what people think. You know, this is a system which over the years has brought him a fair bit of success and he's sticking with it. So, I mean, it will be really interesting tonight because Milan will start with a, well, it looks like a 3-4-3, but, you know, they often play like a box in midfield and so they'll be looking for overloads in there, which hence will cause Tottenham problems. Have you said all of this, Michael? I mean, you could, I mean, you could, and we dissected Tottenham every which way this evening. You could easily see them winning 3-0, couldn't you? Easy. I mean, they're that type of team. Easy. You look straight away, you'd be sat there thinking what we've been worried about, one comfortably, very, very easy. I was just going to say to Chris, do you know, like, when you talk about the hurricane and that sun, would you prefer that somebody won either side in a 3 with 2 behind, or would you prefer to be in that, you know, in the 2? Do you know what's really interesting tonight? Simon Kier talking about the first game and Milan's tactics, and their tactic was block the ball into Hurricane, and then, you know, that's what Simon Kier said, and, you know, we can press the other. So that's there, that'll be their tactic again this evening. I don't think Hurricane is too bothered. What we do know is that, you know, when he gets on the half-turn, if he has runners off him, he is so accurate with his passing. So whether it's just with Son, that relationship, which he has, or Kula Tepeski, he seems to have a good understanding with absolutely everyone. Right then, there are nearly six minutes into the game in Munich, and it's Bayern, Niel, Paris Saint-Germain, Niel, and of course the Germans lead from the first leg by Golds, but we'll keep you very much up to date with that. It's a hard time in the women's super league, Arsenal 2, Liverpool, Niel, and there are about ten minutes to hard time in the other game, and it's Chelsea 2, brighter Niel in the women's super league. And there's three games in the Scottish Premiership, Celtic, Niel, Hartz 1, Hibs 1, Rangers 1, and Livingston 1, Dundee, United, Niel. Michael Goengrin is having a nice hot cup of tea, stay warm, and we'll talk at half-time and enjoy the warmth of the studio. Looking forward to it. How will Chris just down some gloves? No. He went for a warm-up, I believe. He went inside for quite a while, I believe, and had a little bit of a break. Let's use your cliché, say, let's hope the game keeps him warm this evening. Tottenham against AC Milan, second leg at the last 16 of the Champions League, Antonio Conte side a goal down from the first leg. Let's bring in Chris Sutton and Ian Dennis. Thanks, Mark. Well, at Stamford Bridge last night, there was a 10-minute delay, and Chelsea overturned a slender deficit. So those that have gathered here at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will hope there is a repeat in North London as to what happened in West London last night. For what Sun described as Tottenham's most important game of the season, as Harry Kane leads out first, as they always do, keeping with tradition on a European night, all in white, as Theo Hernandez leads out AC Milan, and their strong travelling support over in that far corner have all lifted their white scarves above their heads, as the Champions League anthem sounds on a wet, wintry evening in Tottenham Hotspur, as the two managers embraced down below, will hope that they can find their cutting edge. Certainly, they won't be lacking vocal support tonight, Chris Sutton. A tremendous atmosphere within the stadium. With the weight of expectation now on Tottenham Hotspur, this is their season here tonight. Lose and they'll be trophiless once again, so a huge night. For the last three years, this is the side, Conte, back in the dugout after an absence of three weeks following his emergency gall bladder surgery, brings back Emerson Royallet right wing back to replace Poro. So Forster is in goal, Romero Longley and Davis is the back three. And the team member is suspended, but Hoibier is back from his European band. Emerson and Perisic is the wing backs, Hoibier and Skip in the centre of midfield, Kulesowski, Kane and Sont are the front three, and as the two captains meet with a toss of a coin to the French referee, Planantourpa, the left hand side in their red and black striped shirts and black shorts. Mike Lenion is in goal, back three of Kululu, Tamori and Chow, Messi and Hernandez will be the wing backs, Tanali and Krunjic in the centre of midfield, Brahim Diaz, Liao and Olivier Giroud on his return to the capital. But if you include the opening game in the first leg three weeks ago, his record against Tottenham, 19 appearances and just the four goals, one six, drawn five and lost eight. The former Arsenal and Chelsea striker is currently four games without a goal, as Spurs support, both vocal and hopeful, because you have to go back two years for the last time that Tottenham-Hotspur lost three successive matches, so never in Antonio Conte's reign has that happened. If it was to happen, then surely his reign will be coming to an end. Have you got that feel regardless anywhere, I guess? Yeah, has Pochettino linked with a return to Tottenham I saw this morning, does feel like it could fizzle out, certainly will fizzle out. Antonio Conte, if they won't find a way of going through this evening. Well certainly his press conference focused on his absence after three weeks away. If they were to exit the competition tonight, I'm sure the press conference and the papers headlines will all be about his future, because his contract that he signed, that 18-month deal runs out at the end of the season, and certainly there is a feeling that that option to extend it for a further year will not be exercised. So first all in white are playing from right to left as we look. A skip with a downward header to Kulosevski, tries to get away from Theo Hernandez, but the French referee says there was a foul, and therefore Milan are playing from left to right, and they're attacking that gigantic south stand towards our right-hand side, the largest single-tier stand in the country that holds 17,500. Menon, all in orange, that luminous orange outside of his penalty area, and then Chow plays the ball out towards Timore, forward now to T'Nali. T'Nali tries to come forward over the halfway line, shrugs off the challenge of Hoibier from behind him, and Theo Hernandez with that cross, that was blocked by Romero, and out it goes for a throw to Milan. Yeah, looking forward to watching T'Nali, tenacious midfield, but with a wonderful range of passing. The start's so important for Tottenham, isn't it? They want this fan base to get behind the team, got a start on the front foot. That was the sloppy start in San Siro that cost them with the early goal from Brahim Diaz. By and large, they were comfortable in Milan three weeks ago, with those we were saying in the build-up, grateful to that missed opportunity from the Chow header, and to Ketlar when he came on the bench, just T'Nali wins the ball in midfield to the Milan captain. Hernandez now runs forward, links up with Shiru, and the challenge from Romero takes him out. Romero's going to be careful. He's one of two Tottenham players who's on a yellow card in this starting 11, that could potentially rule him out of a quarter-final appearance. Should he get a yellow card, and it should, of course, Tottenham get through. There's actually... I think it was Skip who brought Hernandez down. We know Hernandez likes to get forward on that left-hand side from Milan, and an early opportunity from the free kick from the central area, halfway in Tottenham's half. There's been winch-re-shallows throughout the day in the capital. Persistent light rain is falling here on a very chilly night in north London. Has Milan wait to take this free kick in a central area? Tanali and Hernandez. It's going to be Hernandez left-footed, a rather flat ball, arcs its way out of the penalty area, and Perichic didn't deal with it. He actually played back by Chow, messiest with a cross headed away by Davis, and it will be retrieved by Kululu on the halfway line, going all the way back to the Milan goalkeeper. Celtic won, Hartz won, Hibbs won, Rangers won, Livingston won, Dunn the United NIL, other ladies scores in the Scottish Premiership, and in the WSL Arsenal 2, Liverpool NIL, Chelsea 2, Brighton and Hove Albion NIL, and there's no goals in the other game in the Champions League, last 16, Bayern against Paris, San Schumann. This is exclusive radio commentary from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, and this is the voice of Chris. It's just interesting the way Milan have set up under Piolli, and known for their flexibility, the thought that they would be, and start with three centre halves are actually, good like they're shaping up in the back four, over four, two, three, one, but that may change. Great noise, as I'm sure you can hear, coming through however you listen to BBC Radio 5 Live these days. The Tottenham supporters are certainly responding to the call of Conte, who wanted an amazing atmosphere. Now can his team respond to what he said, the energy he wants to give them from the training field, since he returned back to the training complex on Monday. Hoibier in the centre circle, challenge comes in from Giroud, picked up now by Krunjic in the midfield, ball goes through to Forster. It's good from Skip, actually making the challenge. He just hurt himself on making that challenge on Krunjic, it's good work from Giroud pinching the ball back, but I like what I've seen from Skip, saw him for a season at Norwich City on loan. He did well, bearing in mind they were bereft of options three weeks ago, and Milan, it was Skip and Sar that started in the midfield. You look at Milan's back line now, it is a tree. They're changing all the time, but that's the way they have changed of late under Piolli. It's seen an improvement in their fortunes as well up until the weekend when they lost at Fiorentina. Halftime in the WSL, Kelly Summers at Chelsea. Chelsea 2, managerless Brighton, Niel, Goon right in penalty and a chest-car to strike, mean Chelsea are in control. Niel had one ruled out of Sidewars, Kankowicz hit the bar, Chelsea responding well to their lead cup final defeat, and as it stands, going within a point of the league leaders Manchester United. Chelsea 2, Brighton Niel. Niel Niel here, this is Perichic, looking to Kulosewski, Kulosewski beaten though in the put chase, Tamori glided across the surface, that greasy wet surface, but in fact the French referee, Clemence Taupan, is going to bring it back for a free kick for a late challenge on Perichic. Yeah, it was a brilliant touch from Perichic. He tried to feed the ball through from Kulosewski, and he did feed the ball through. It was a really strong challenge from Kululu, Kululu thankful that Tamori really put the burners on then, got back, looked like Kulosewski might get there before him. Getting used to that Celtic equaliser, Roddy Poseid. Yes indeed, a massive incident lately, Maide getting it from six yards, like the opener by Gineli, there was a long VR offside check before, it was granted Maide has now gone off, you're replaced by Jota, there was a red card check for that one, but at the moment it's all square in Glasgow, and Edinburgh won each between Celtic and Harps. Livingston lead, bottom of the table, done de-united by a goal to Niel. Perichic is hobbling badly as he makes his way out to this near side the left, the ball is played through, they find Son in the central area, they lay off to Emerson, out then to Kulosewski, back with Son, triangular passing patterns, the back heel there by Emerson gives the ball away, up towards Giroux, cut out though by Romero, runs forward for Tottenham-Hotspur, we've been playing for seven minutes, still no goals, Milan lead one-nil, on aggregate, Chow brings it forward, stop though by Hoibier, Chow back to his feet, looking for the forward ball towards Giroux, cut out by Ben Davis, crowd urging Tottenham-Hotspur. Romero enters the centre-circle, plays it to Hoibier, and now out to Davis, ball inside is a diagonal one, quite low, Son, skip, finds Kulosewski, comes into a central area, Emerson provides the width, far side, Emerson now with the ball at his feet, Kulosewski's gone ahead of him, plays the ball inside to skip, here is Hoibier now, has a little glance over his left shoulder, plays it back towards skip, and at the minute, Milan have got a number of people back behind the ball, but they reach the feet of Kane, Kane tries to deliver the cross from the right-hand side, he gets the throw. They were mentioned before the game, Simon Kier in the first game saying they stopped that supply into Harry Kane, but what a wonderful first touch from him. George across the ball then, it was blocked, he's the creator, it was the best creator and best finisher. Got to stop Harry Kane, Milan have. It was a real tussle between Kier and Kane three weeks ago, an old-fashioned tussle at times, he was manhandling Harry Kane, certainly Kat Nevin wasn't too impressed with the officiating at the time, that's the poor clearance by Milan to Hoibier, under 30 yards out from goal, he finds Kane inside right, channel the penalty area, tries to work over the cross, good handling though by the French international goalkeeper, Mike Mignol. He used his body very well there, Harry Kane, trying to stand the ball up on that right-hand touchline, couldn't get enough on it. Kulisevsky and Somme playing really narrow in and around, Harry Kane working off his little flicks on his hold-up play. It's all of a skip getting it, a bit of a telling off in the referee. Yeah, wasn't necessarily a hold-up play, he was holding on to the out, just trying to tug him back around the hips, so again, quite lenient, the French referee and just a talking to to the Spurs would feel them. Kulula, messy ass coming forward to Nali on the overlap, blocking from Perichic, who of course was played under Piolli for a season, when he's time into Milan, and he seems to be running freely as well after that late challenge, but Milan in front of the south stand, the way towards our right, they've got a throw almost down by the corner flag, ten minutes almost played, messiest with the throw. Poybierre, chance to clear, taken away from him by Somme, his own player, he played it back to Davies who clips it up towards the halfway line and then Kulula will just find Tamori, from a Chelsea player who's recently returned after injury, he was back against Fiorentina at the weekend after missing six matches with a hip problem, Menon goes long and directs and Longley gets the shout from Fraser Forster and it goes through. Both sides beaten at the weekend, they win the Fiorentina, as far as my Wolves, Romero collected a ball from Forster, they pressed and they won the ball back there over at Milan, Fernandez left hand side, played it back to the edge of the area, Grunitz lost it, one back point, Poybierre, Spurs come forward, Kain, Kulusevski right hand side, enters the penalty area, Kulusevski pulls it back, Emerson shots, takes the deflection and Menon had to just readjust and then dive to his left to make his mothering save, nil nil. Yeah, Poybierre initially did brilliantly with Milan, had bodies forward, intercepts the ball and pops it into Harry Kane, he's on the halfway line, he plays the ball in turn out to Kulusevski, trying to drive inside on that left foot, lays the ball off and Emerson, royal, he's got a safe effort with his left foot, side foot takes his deflection and a comfortable save. Tottenham have it though, this is Skip, midway through the Milan half, running away from Tarnale, got a nudge in the back there, referee though, let's play continue, in fact didn't actually play the advantage, I, they clearly didn't see anything wrong with that, here is Davis short of the halfway line, Sond being tracked by Kululu, does well, Emerson tucked in, plays it out now to Kulusevski, coming in off that right touch line, Kulusevski's left foot across, Paracic was making that late run towards the far post, if you notice the Milan support, and it's amazing how many of them are all wearing black, there are a large number, all in black, however there are three who are just standing on their seats, in fact there's now four, you thought you were cold without gloves, they're bare chested. Are they stupid? I mean it's freezing. It is freezing, they'll be shivering for their stupidity, if that's what you want to say, so it might make you feel a little bit warmer, the Al, was he taken down off the board, it was a tussle, referees coming under pressure from a lot of the Milan players. It was long late, it was really good from Diaz on the half turn, and Liao had made that run, and he's the one who's going to try and stretch the Tottenham back line out. Long late knows exactly what he's doing, brings him down, makes no attempt to play the ball, really surprised the referee hasn't brandished the yellow card, and so is Piolli. He's been very lenient in these opening 13 minutes, the French referee, so long late along with Romero, on that yellow peril if you like, but no action taken. Liao is the one they've got to watch, there were moments in San Siro ways, he's a real live wire, Hernandez breaking forward, Hernandez with a cross, took a deflection and diverted it into the path of Fraser Forster. Talk about Liao, but that was a brilliant ball into Hernandez who loves to get forward on that left hand side. You're thinking if he can get the ball past long late, Giroud was free at the far post with an easy tap in, the cross was deflected. To Hernandez, he'll look to get forward at every opportunity, the Milan captain on that far side, plays it back to Tamori, Tamori, that goes into that central area, midway through his own half for Malik Chow, only reaching double figures tonight with his 10th appearance, signed from Schalke, of course he had that golden opportunity with a header in the second half in San Siro, Spurs really could have been a lot worse for them, as it is, they're looking to try and overturn that early goal from Brayhinde Yaz from Milan in that first leg. So Milan still have the advantage 1-0 on aggregate, as Kalulu turns away from Sond, Brayhinde Yaz, dispossessed by Davis, Sond midway through his own half, plays it back, long lay now along the ground, it reaches Emerson, 10 yards inside his own half, little flick then to Kulisewski on the half way line, and now back with Romero, 15 minutes played here, delayed kickoff, it remains 0-0, another goal of Easter Road, Connie McLaughlin. It's Hibs I Rangers 2, Antonio Tjola giving Rangers the lead, the layoffers from Fashionsacala and Tjola slotted into the back of the net, Hibs I Rangers 2. Thanks Connie, Celtic still touring 1-1 at Hota Hearts, Livingston 1-0, Hernandez far side to Nali, chips it long, looking for Giroud to make the run. Perishic actually might have played him onside there, the booze obviously for Giroud and picked up by Forster. It's a really good run from Giroud because I suspect the three Tottenham centre-harsles think, well at 36 he's never been the quickest, everything's going to be to feet and then coming deep, but living long way, something to think about there, well time drawn in behind. Here is that to Nali, Giroud again has never made a diagonal run in steadily out, totally offended by Romero, this has got me, yellow card, surely, there it is, and Romero now is suspended for the first leg of the quarter-final, should Tottenham get through. That is just a wild challenge isn't it from Romero, this is a real opportunity for Milan, Paul just popped into the out, Romero goes to ground, it's actually out down and must be a 26-27 yards out central position for Milan, just dived in there, Romero seen into it before. That's his 20th yellow card for Tottenham in his 54th appearance, he's got to make sure that he doesn't get a third red card in Tottenham colours. Anyway what he has done, he's given Milan a free kick, it's under 30 yards out from goal, it's fractionally left of centre, Milan playing from left to right, 17 minutes played, 0-0 BBC Radio 5 live are also available on BBC sounds, and Giroud is there, Brahim Diaz also is now just taking four or five steps away, Spurs have everybody back. Giroud is now going to join, no he's not, he's just going to have a word with the two Milan players in front of the Tottenham wall, Brahim Diaz is poised, he leaves it, Giroud touches it, Tnali plays it, Messi has opened up the opportunity and pulls it wide, hit it right footed across the face of goal, out for a goal kick, 0-0. I'll tell you what, it's dreadful defending, and Davis it really is, clever little free kick routine from Milan, ball into Tnali and fizzed out right to Messi as Davis thinks he can win the ball in front of Messi as he doesn't, Messi takes a good first touch, shoots across goal, really chokes the shot, pulls the shot, well wide a Fraser Forster's right hand post should have done better, should have worked Forster. You could already sense the frustration from the Tottenham crowd, Milan have probably started the better, certainly the crowd then as it went to, I think it was Ben Davis, the lack of urgency, the fact that it seemed a little bit more cautious, the Spurs fans were on at them. Here is Cerkane outside the centre circle, Foybier runs forward, remember the motto, to dare is to do. Here is Perichic, Foybier, 19 minutes played, still 0, long lay, ball played forward to skip, there's been no real threat so far from Tottenham, Kulaceski might change that now, Emerson on the overlap, plays him in, he waits, doesn't deliver it first time, Emerson's low ball easily cleared away by Timore, header one by Romero, Davis plays it out towards Emerson, Spurs fans want to see Tottenham on the front foot, Foybier brings it off the chest, finds Kain, the return ball almost reached the Dane, broken up though in the midfield by Krunjec, kept alive by Davis, it's gone now, Spurs, wrought on and Davis mis-controls the ball. And it's catching, look how many now are those bare-chested Milan fans behind the goal, at first there were three, then there were four, now there's about a dozen. Yeah, there's more than a dozen, let's see how long it lasts then. Of all the nights to do it, tonight wasn't one of them. Anyway, that was better from Tottenham. Yeah, it was, I'm surprised Harry Kain missed that pass to Foybier, looked for a little give-and-go, good interception from Chow, full touch from Davis, on the overlap from Perisic, just got to be ruthless when they get the opportunity. Longley now is Shona Yellow, can't, Tottenham's defensive problems are mounting should they reach the last eight. And Conte is now Shona Yellow as well. So both Longley and Romero will miss the quarter-final first leg, should Spurs get through. And Conte's been booked too. Also, let's just think about this evening, they've put themselves under massive pressure on Llan Romero now. They've not fought any more reckless challenges. Conte said he's found his energy again, Ian. Let's see the challenge from Longley. I don't think that, he does catch Giroud with his arm, but he's using his arms as leverage to leap and attack the ball, and sometimes these collisions, these clashes happen. Well, Dyer will be back, but both central defenders there, Longley and Romero have been booked. Spurs meanwhile, as Chris Sutton quite rightly says, have got to focus on the task in hand before worrying about reaching the last eight. They've got to try and start posing a threat to Milan's back line, as we approach the midway point of this first half. To Nali, Giroud is able to continue after that blow to the head with a free kick. Ciao in the centre circle, back to the dark-haired to Nali. Messi out to Kallulu, down below, back with the to Nali once again. And Milan controlling the game at the moment. To Mori. This is where once again, when they're in possession, they switch to the four that you've said about before, and then they push Teo Hernandez further up on that left flank. Yeah, he's flexible. Bioli, interesting reading his comments before the game. Spurs won't surprise us, and in fairness, the Spurs set-up doesn't surprise anybody. This is what Conte does. For whatever reason, he thinks his team are going to grind this Milan team down. Grunits has lost the ball in the midfield of his own half. Hoibier plays it to Son. Shoots from distance, takes the deflection, Off-Krunjic, and it was back behind for a corner kick. What can they do from a set-piece? Struggling to get any sort of momentum from open play. Son to take the corner kick. Notice that there are three South Korean flags that are being waved. Not too far from Son as he prepares to take the corner on this near side of the left. Milan have everybody back. Nil-Nil on the night. Milan lead 1-0 overall. Son rolls it in to Hoibier, back towards Son left-hand side. Son kills it towards the far post. Too much on it. And once again, you can sense that frustration inside the stadium. The stadium of over 62,000 supporters. One off the training ground there. Hoibier coming short. Just to work a different angle for Son to cross the wall in for. Looking for Harry Kane at the far post, but the cross really wayward. Two or three yards over Kane's head. Here is Yerou, dispossessed by Davis. Trying to win it back with Diaz. From the Manchester City player Romero in the centre circle. Hits a hopeful ball downfield. Perisic was getting after it, but it goes out of play for a goal kick. You of course played against Milan in the Champions League, didn't you? During your time for Celtic. Send a midfield. I was. I think we drew Nil-Nil. That's right, at home. Won't be lost away 3-1, is that right? That is correct, yeah. Equalised and considered two late goals in the San Siro. You were booked in San Siro on that night. You'll be hoping for more than one card for your 50th birthday on Friday, I'm sure. Wow. 50 really? Yeah. I've got to say you don't look it. I thought you were near a 55. So did my wife. Forlster. To Davis. To Davis. Early birthday wishes anyway. Kane dropped steep for Toppen. Emerson over the halfway line ahead of him to Kuleszewski. He gets in behind Hernandez. Hernandez though gets back all side and good defending. All the last touch came off Hernandez. I think he thought it was going to go out for a goal kick. It is a goal kick. It is a goal kick. He was right. He was right. It's just a shame, isn't it? But Antonio Conte and Spurs that... All the Spurs players can't hold on to the ball like Harry Kane. Brilliant from deep there. Releasing the ball and popping it out right. And came to nothing in the end. Goal kick is taken short back to Mignon. Couple of touches inside that penalty area. Plays it out wide to Timore. Timore then hits it long. Jiru on the halfway line. Toppen with Tyria. Half time at East-Sarouk. Kona McGlockin. Hip-fond, Rangers 2. Hips early lead only lasted four minutes. A corner goes their own goal. Giving them the advantage. But James Tavernier's penalty cancelled that out. And Antonio Tchola put them ahead after the layoff from fashion to Cal. As always, they'll be very much keeping an eye and an ear on what's happening in Glasgow, given the fact that Celtic at the moment are drawing with Hips, Hips, Hips on Rangers 2. Yes, they are. Celtic won, Hartz won and Livingston won. Dundee united nil. Emerson is down over on that far side. This is an 8-10 kickoff. We were delayed by 10 minutes. There's still no goals in unit between Bayern and Paris-Saint-Germain. The Milan supporters are making all the noise. So, whilst there's a stoppage in play, we'll get the half-time details from Roddy for Celtic. Celtic won, Hartz won. Ginelli putting Hartz ahead after a long VR offside check. And then Mairi equalising for Celtic after the same. Mairi then came off, Ginelli on top, Jota came on. Jota hit the post. Make sense of all of that if you can. Celtic won, Hartz won. No sign of Porro yet. He is warming up, though, down below. Emerson is still getting treatment in the WSL. Kelly Summers watching Chelsea Brighton. Yeah, the second half has got underway. 52 minutes on the clock. It's still Chelsea 2. Brighton nil. A reminder. Guru Wrightons penalty and Jess Carter's first half strike mean the Blues are in cruise control and going within a point of Manchester United at the summit. No real chances in this second half. 2-0. Commentary that continues on sports extra. Arsenal 2 Liverpool nil in the WSL is also a latest score. Emerson is on his feet. What have you made of Tottenham's start? In the 28th minute, it's nil-nil and they've created very little. Yeah, Manon hasn't had anything of note to do in the Milan goal. I'm surprised with what's at stake this evening. Tottenham know what they have to do and it's... They've actually seemed to be playing with a bit of fear. cautious. I mean, look, nothing's lost yet for Tottenham, but I expected a start of far greater intensity. It's nil-nil, BBC Radio 5 live. Milan at the minute has got to be set a comfortable. I think if you're Piolli and you've weathered the first half an hour, as they've done, he would be absolutely made up with that. Minion of the edge of his area, the goalkeeper hits it downfield. Emerson is back on the pitch, heads it away. Giroud knocks it back to Hernandez, the left wing back. Tomori gets a touch, Tnali at a walking pace, easily picks out Krunjic, and Krunjic then to Chow. Chow forward to Tnali, again no pressure on the ball. Tnali strokes it out towards Liao, left-hand side. He's got pace, he's got tricks, he's got the skills. He's certainly got the thread as he looks to come forward now, but Skip just did enough, but Brahim Diaz helps it out towards Messi on this right-hand side. Messi has now shown on the outside by Perichic, goes back in field to Brahim Diaz, but Milan at the minute just stringing the passes together. Krunjic, it'll turn, shot by Diaz, loses the ball, Perichic to Skip, up towards Kane. Kuleseski streaking ahead of him, he finds it. Kuleseski now running forward, stumbles, no power, says the referee, and Tnali brings the ball clear, much to the frustration of the Spurs crowd. Half an hour play, Milan on the attack, Liao drifting inside from the left, finds Messi. Messi, running forward onto his left foot, Messi has a goal, and it's a way with Finish, it's into that south stand, it's a goal kick. 15 minutes to go and a half time, Niel Niel. You can hear the booze ringing around. Kuleseski did slip, and then Milan break the other end, and Messi has, on that right-hand side, a right wing back, you could say, Milan being very fluid, but likes to come inside on that left foot, decent shooting opportunity. Spurs, Perichic and Davis need to really be switched onto that, high and wide, the effort was. Spurs play out from the back, and then Forster goes long towards Harry Kane. He was unable to hold onto the ball, Messi now has it on the right-hand side, turns back on the halfway line to Kalulu, midway through his own half, and he will go back to Menon. Menon just waits, he's certainly bolstered the Milan side after coming back for the last two games against Atalanta and Fiora and Tina after being out for five months with a calf injury. Then Davis to Sont, hardly mentioned Sont's name in the commentary so far. Another move breaks down for Spurs. That front three have been very, very quiet. Kulaszewski with a trick on Hernandez in the centre-circle. Three-kick to Milan. I think that's something which has been levelled at the top in the midfield this season. They're not creative enough on the ball. Yes, wayward pass from Skip. Milan coming forward again. It's been too comfortable for Milan. It's been too tepid from Tottenham. Can't say talking about the players need to put themselves under pressure. T'Nali forward ball, Giroud takes it neatly off the chest. It was offside anyway. He did try for the acrobatics, but it didn't quite come off. Play continues. Kane picks it up now outside the centre-circle. He looks towards Sont, won't reach him, and Tomori takes it away from Sont over on that far side, and then Tomori plays it back towards his goalkeeper. Kulaszewski will run towards Mignon, clears high, downfield, and he's picked out Messi as... And Messi as now to Brahim Diaz. Closed down by two players, Longley and Perichic, but he holds onto the ball and then knocks it back. Remember when they played Chelsea, and everyone was saying they turned the corner, and they were lauding, remember on match of the day too, I think it was, about the wing-backs providing the width for Tottenham. The same system tonight. There's been no width, and the wing is offside against Teo Hernandez. Where is the creativity going to come from from this Tottenham side? It's, as always, it's Harry Kane, isn't it? Ball into Harry Kane and hope... He provides a wonder pass, a brilliantly weighted pass for runners off him. But they haven't used the width very well this evening. Kulaszewski normally good in those 1v1 situations. Hasn't got the better of Hernandez, really. Tomori, Emerson Royal has got forward, but very little end product, and Perichic has had a quiet game. Hasn't he so far? Yes, he has. I think many spare supporters will say he's been disappointing since his arrival from Italy and into Milan. When you think that last season, when he won the Coppa Italia, he contributed 10 goals. He's yet to score, and this is his 35th appearance. Harry would love to change that against Milan, but another ball given away in the midfield. If Antonio Conte's wish was to transfer his energy to the players, it hasn't worked. It's been an erastrune 35 minutes so far from Tottenham, Oxford. One where they're lacking penetration, lacking creativity, and toiling at the moment. It's not the transfer of energy which is required, it's a transfer of ability in the Tottenham midfield. It's full of you out with the Aaron Parson. You use the word that this side looked fearful. It's an atmosphere that they really should be looking to thrive in when you've got the vocal support for Tottenham and a sell-out crowd of just under 63,000. Kulaceski, diagonal ball, finds Emerson. Emerson to Harry Kane. Harry Kane's cross took a deflection, diverted away by the legs of Menon, and then a head-to-behind for a corner kick, per spur. Yeah, that was Emerson. Coming into a central role, and the players are in the third to fourth. That pops the ball out right to Harry Kane. Harry Kane is in fact trying to feed a cross in to Sonnet the Far Post, takes a deflection, and Menon makes a save. Corner taken quickly and short. Back to Kulaceski, clips over the cross. No-one read it in the Far Post, and it was over here and out for a goal kick, 0-0. You have to be a BFG there to read that. I mean, blimey, that was similar to the Son cross, wasn't it, where they had the corner? That's just gone high and over Harry Kane at the Far Post. Hurried, too much haste. A lack of quality, final third. Composure. Absolutely. Nine minutes to go at a half-time in a frustrating first half. 0-0. Romero to Longley. Poivier drops midway through his own half. Davis is out towards his left-hand side. Back to Poivier again. Poivier chips it across to Romero. Emerson is ahead of him. As he comes short, Chow read that as he was trying to play into Harry Kane. He goes out of play, it's a spurs throw. Harry Kane himself takes it on that right touch line. Back to Romero. Poivier again, drops short on the halfway line, goes back. Romero being chased by Giroud to Forster. Awkward ball for Forster for Ben Davis. It forced him further back, deeper into his own half. And then Son can't get the better of Messi, yes. Yeah, if there's a criticism of Fraser Forster as a goalkeeper, he's never had a great reputation for being good with the ball at his feet. That pass put Davis under all sorts of pressure. Five yards out behind him, and the ball popped into Son who had to come deep. Good world to win a throw in. Well, they snatched top spot, if you recall, in Group D in the final seconds against Marseille. They might well be having to leave it late the way it's going. They're certainly going to need to improve on the performance in the second half. We've got about seven and a bit minutes to go to the break. And you'll hear, I'm sure, yourselves, when the whistle sounds from the Spurs support, because they will not be impressed. Especially, you know, talking before the game about Melanze-Way record this season, and they have been so, so far away from home. And you think, well, Tottenham will come out of the trap, so they'll try and catch this Melanze team cold, and really take the game to them. But it's tentative Tottenham. It's tame Tottenham. Certainly, the Spurs supporters wouldn't accept a tame surrender. But Davis almost ran into the wall to the out. Emerson picks it up now in the halfway line. Fines came. Back with Skip. Skip to Longley. Longley now finds Davis. Perishic should have made the run. Davis, though, goes back. Hoybierre. Where's that ambition? Where's that sense of adventure? Perishic. Now with Davis, the playing in front of Melanze. Here now is Romero on the halfway line. Davis forward ball. Hoybierre. Romero. Not really going anywhere, though, at Tottenham. Romero now finds Kulesheski. Tried to thread it forward towards Sond. Emerson might have been the better option for the wick on the right-hand side. Kulesheski chops down Giroux, and it's a free kick to Melanze. They actually were really patient there. Tottenham went forward, came back out, and then they did create an overload with Kulesheski in off the line in the central area. But his pass was full. Has he been booked there? Kulesheski, I don't think so. He's lucky to get away with that. More than down Giroux. The last reach, the quarter-finals in 2012. That early Brahim-Diaz goal from three weeks ago is still the difference between the two sides. But Menon really hasn't been tested at all, except maybe that Kane cross that forced him to deflect it away with his legs. You could have saved that. Probably as tall as Menon, to be fair. Whether I've got the same agility as him, I doubt. Is that a lie? And not as old as you. Here is Skip, returning and getting the ball back from Kane. Goes down under a challenge, gets a free kick. Says everything at the minute, the smurfs support is cheering free kicks. Because in open play, they're just not creating, and they don't look like they're going to create. Kulesheski cleared away by Tamori. They're waiting for that magic moment, and you wouldn't put it past them. Because some of the players they have at their disposal. Here is Davis. Half-time, by the way, in Munich, Bayern still lead by a goal to Niel in that time. Benfica and of course, Chelsea last night, through to the last eight, the draws on the 17th of March. As Forster hits it long, Perichic has stayed forward, he gets the flick on, but there's nobody to run in behind. Sondin didn't go early enough, there's a big diagonal, booming kick from Forster. Perichic got up well, but Sondin didn't gamble early enough, and the line in possession. Kronijic on the edge of his own penalty area, plays it to Kalulu, who hits it downfield, flick on there by Giroud, taken on the chest by Laow, tightly marked by Romero, Spurs have it back, Emerson plays it forward, Harry Kane is dropping deeper and deeper to get hold of the ball. Now it's with Romero to Davis, three minutes to go to halftime. Sondr wriggles away from the challenge of Kalulu. Emerson again is forward, Sondr holds on to the ball. Kane, the crowd wanted it played early. Just that degree of hesitation. Now with Davis, what could have been half a promising moment on the right, Milan now have got... Enough men back behind the ball, Spurs of Ponderis, Kulacsevski, right-hand side, Kulacsevski with a cross, Perichic downward header at the far post, easily claimed by the goalkeeper. No power on the header, Nil Nil. Hanging ball, Perichic got up well, trying to head the ball down to Harry Kane, but... ..in the end, gathered. But you're right, the fact that Sond just hesitated with that pass allows the Milan backline to regroup and get into position. Brahim Diaz comes forward, gets away from Hoibier, his diagonal ball has gone behind Liao, who made a run towards the inside right channel of the penalty area. Emerson runs it away for Spurs, all in white, playing from right to left with two minutes to go to halftime. Still Nil Nil, BBC Radio 5 live and also live on BBC Sound. Hoibier goes back to skip, skip forward ball, easily intercepted by Hernandez. And Hernandez then stopped by skip. Emerson flies into the sliding challenge. Krujnic though picks it up. And then Milan have been tied, you're in possession. And they just comfortably keep the ball, and Tanali just strokes it from that far side of the left to Kalulu on this near side. Spurs are going to have 45 minutes here to save their season. No, absolutely right. I mean, what do we know though? We know that Spurs have been inconsistent all season. Quite frankly, they have been bang average in this first half, so maybe I'll be in the second half where they really kick into gear. That's got to be the hope. Here is Messi-Ass, that's a smart turn there was Davis. But having seen Milan in both games against Chelsea in the group stages, being in San Siro three weeks ago, this is not the great Milan side. And yet Tottenham are making them look so superior. I couldn't agree more. I mean, Chelsea, who have struggled their season, blew Milan away twice, didn't they? Tanali, his forward ball cleared away by Longley. Chow plays it to Timore. Hernandez on that far side, plenty of space. We're about to find out how much added on time there will be by the fourth official here. You'll know when the half-time whistle sounds. I'm sure the Spurs supporters will let their feelings know. In fairness, Fraser Forstner has had very little to do as well. But in saying Milan have been the more confident team. Two minutes about it on time, which we're now into. But Milan equally don't have to chase the game, do they? The onus is on Tottenham. Hence why we all expected to really fly out of the traps. But it's the Tottenham team this season who have shown that at times they're very fragile. You look at the last couple of results, Sheffield United, Wolves, a couple of losses. And they are just half a yard short all over the pitch, aren't they, so far? Here is Emerson, stopped by Hernandez. Back to Hoivier. Hoivier leaves it for Emerson. Six yards inside the Milan half. Fiennes Davis, Perichic is ahead of him. Davis will run forward. Croatian international, his cross right foot at his curling, claimed by Manuel. The target was Harry Kane, underarm throwout, towards Liao, who's got the pace to come forward now for Milan. And he opens it up to Brahim Diaz. Diaz, man inside, is Kronjic. Kronjic, looking to Sheru, he was already peeling back the left foot. That was a very important header away by Emerson. Otherwise, Sheru had the goal in his sights. It goes out for a throw to Milan, far side. One into the other, and they work it well, Milan. And Sheru, doing that all his career, just peels away from his marker at the far post, asking for a diagonal ball to be whipped in. Kronjic did that. Emerson, crucial head up. It certainly was. Milan have been the more cohesive unit. They've had that. They strike you as a better balance side. Spurs really are struggling here. Throw comes in from the far side, Gia was forward. Refredo gives the goal kick to Tottenham. But I would imagine that that probably would be it for this first half. Just the two minutes have added on. The ball headed, Steffen Piolli, and indeed is the halftime whistle. And the booze and cheers tell the story of frustration here after a first half of Tottenham, Hotspur, Mellan, and Niel. And if Spurs don't book up their ideas, they're heading out of Europe and their season will be over. Yeah, absolutely. An enormous second half for Tottenham, who haven't turned up. They have been miles off it. Really tame and tepid against the Milan team, who haven't travelled well this season. Milan have been the better team, but you have to say, Spurs still do have hope, but they actually need to start taking the game to Milan and gambling and risking. They certainly do. Halftime in the Tottenham, Hotspur Stadium, Tottenham, Hotspur, Niel, Milan, Niel. The reaction says it's all Chris, doesn't it, really, of those fans? It's just... It's been a remarkable performance with what does it stake. I mean, just going back to what Son said before the game, the most important game of the season. It doesn't feel like it with the Tottenham performance in that first half. They've been way off it. Harry Kane has shown some nice touches and held on to the ball well. We know he can do that. They haven't created anything of note. They've had a couple of crossing opportunities from corners, which have been wayward. They had the cross from Terrasic halfway into the Milan half-right, putted from out near the Bailand. That's not... I'm near the touchline. Sorry. That's not a great crossing position. But they really lack creativity in the middle of the park. Skip is Walkman-like, you know, tenacious, his tackles, Hoibier, very, very similar to that. I think it's a massive problem for them. But they still have hope. They get the next goal in this tie. They're well and truly back in it. From the land's point of view, I'm sure Piolli thought, you know, Spurs are going to come out of the traps, they're going to come after them. I bet he's spoken the changing room before to the Milan players. We have to weather the first 15 minutes. But Spurs didn't really lay a glove on them. Really disappointed. That creativity, Michael Brown, goes back to the pre-match discussion about two in midfield, doesn't it? That's exactly what we're talking about. You're looking to see how deep Harry Kane comes right back in to get the ball. Yes, he's great as it comes into feet, or he bats it off around the corner, et cetera, holds on, brings other people in. But really, that extra midfielder probably crying out for it to be a little bit more solid, a little bit crazier from the middle of the pitch to be able to feed these strikers whether it be Son, whether it be Kane in better positions, higher up the pitch, shots on target, non-existent chappers in a game that has this much intensity, this much pressure on the side. And really, that level of patience is not really washing is it with these Spurs supporters, the frustrations in the ground as the board develops a round on build-up, they're just not having it. So it's going to have to be a huge difference and much quicker, higher tempo, second half has not been great one bit. Michael Brown, Chris Sutton with us this evening back for the second half. It's goalless at half-time in Munich as well between Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain. So Bayern are going through there at the moment, 1-0 on aggregate. Two games in the women's Super League this evening, five minutes to go at Arsenal, they lead Liverpool by two goals to nil. Kelly Summers is watching Chelsea against Brighton. Yeah, we're in the closing stages here, Mark. Chelsea 3, Brighton nil, just as Brighton were getting back into it. Turland with a couple of chances could have made it interesting will Chelsea have surely finished them off. Samka playing it across to Kania to tap home. Chelsea 3, second bottom Brighton nil. Chelsea are going within a point of leaders man United. The two incidentally face off on Sunday. That's the game you can watch live on BBC 2 at 12.30. Let's go to Hibbs where there's been another goal, Conny McLachlan. It is, and it's another one for Rangers. That's now three for them, one for the home side. A mistake at the back by Hibbs, allowing the fashions to call it. Who looked like he's pretty much put this game to bed now. Rangers are hoping, of course, the score line stays the same in glass, but it's currently one-one, isn't it, between Celtic and Hards? Hibbs, one, Rangers three. Is it Roddy? It is indeed, and we are well into the second half now. We are 11 minutes and to be precise, still one each. And it was a very eventful first half with the Hards taking the lead, Josh Giunelli from a Halliday cross. It was a long VR offside check as there was at the equaliser when Maeda rolled home from six yards. Then Maeda went off and Jota came on, and Giunelli went off for Hards and Uta came on, and then Jota hit the post. So it was a lively first half. Since then, the Celtic fans have not been entirely happy at Hards' performance because they've taken the game to Celtic more than the fans had expected. At the moment, though, it's Celtic won Hards' one, and by the way, they know all too well what the score line is from Easter Road. One other game in the Scottish Championship this evening, and on the hour, Dundee United, the bottom club have equalised at Livingston. Livingston won Dundee United won. We will talk about the players' championship in the gulf during half-time. We'll touch on Manchester United ahead of their Europa League game against Real Betis as well, hopefully here from Marcus Rashford after Stuart Clarkson. Listen on BBC Sounds. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thank you, Mark. Good evening.

And we'll be back at Tottenham shortly, where it is goalless at half time. So Milan are going through on aggregate goalless in the other Champions League game as well between Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain. So Bayern lead by a goal to nil on aggregate and the second half has just got underway in that game. The players' championship gets underway tomorrow at Sawgrass. Our correspondent Ian Carter joins us now. And oh, we're talking live, are we? And the proposed changes here. Who'd have thought? Who'd have thought? Yeah, who'd have thought, Kehey? Listen, I think it's fair to say that pretty much every conversation with a player here this week has involved discussion of the proposed changes that are going to come to the PGA Tour all in response to the arrival. And I suppose the threat of the Saudi Arabia-funded Live Tour. In short, what we're going to see, Mark, is several smaller field tournaments with no cut next year, but plenty of opportunity still for players to force their way into those designated events that will feature, what, 70 to 80 players. I've actually been speaking to the US Open Champion, Matt Fitzpatrick. Guess what? It came up as a subject of conversation and asked him for his take on the proposed changes. My big thing is, regardless of who you are or what the scenario is, if you want to compete the best and you want to win the best rewards, then you've got to play the best. And whether that's putting in the work, whether that's playing the best in the tournament, that's what you've got to do. You look at Tiger or all his interviews, it says the same thing. You've got to find it in the dirt. I seem to remember it being his quote. So I think it doesn't really matter who you are. You've got to play well to be part of it. And I think that is what is exciting, that you do have a chance to be part of it and play well this year and get in amongst the thick of it. But at the same time, I can understand why there's mixed reviews of it. But I just think golf's a game of getting it in the hole and as few shots as possible and whoever can do that the best, the most often, is the best player. And I think that is the most important thing from this, is that there is a possibility for anyone to be in these top events that everyone's kind of talking about. And likewise, you can go out and do it. There's nothing stopping you. It's not like anyone's stopping you from being in these events. You go out and play well this year and that's where you end up. What's the best answer to live? I don't really know what the answer is to live. I think it's just such a huge combination of not problems or issues, just scenarios, variables. And I think it's difficult to find what the right answer is. I think this is an A answer. Hopefully this is the long-term future and it works out well and it is the answer, like you say. There's things going on so please go on to the next show... Until you see it next year. To see how fans react. I don't think we'll know. Back to Ian shortly... configuredly scored off. The Reapp이�d was delivered by Sout 有chiefsof味nhash닥 . M pasture pencil shot por mong . two-one at the moment. Details of that fourth goal for Rangers from Connie McLaughlin. Yeah if there was any fear mark that Rangers might drop points here again at Easter Road as they did earlier in the season, well that has very much been put to bed because that is now for Antonio Choloch again linking up with fashion Stakala who sent in the cross and it was Choloch who sent David Marshall the wrong way. Hibs won Rangers 4. Now let's go back to the goal because by putting aside the proposed changes and live and all of that the start of the year has been absolutely fascinating and and you it will obviously continue this week. Absolutely and what we've seen is the best players in the world winning the biggest tournaments. You know on the DP World Tour the biggest tournament so far was the Dubai Desert Classic. Rory McRoy won that. John Rahm is a multiple winner this year. He is the world number one at the moment. McRoy's number three in the sandwich. Scotty Scheffler who defended his title in Phoenix so week in week out the big names are hitting the heights on the leaderboard and those three interestingly have been paired together or grouped together for the first two rounds so they'll command an awful lot of attention. One thing I would say is that this is a capricious place this golf course and it can serve up a very unpredictable list of former champions so I don't think it's a given that one of the big names will win this week and the other thing to say is because of live no Cameron Smith here as a defending champion indeed 31 players who were here last year who are now competing on the Saudi Arabia funded circuit and not eligible to play in this week's event. Okay thank you very much Ian commentary of day three of the players championship on sports extra from eight o'clock on Saturday and from eight forty five on Sunday. By and have just had a goal ruled out for offside I think in the Allianz arena so it's still goal was there between themselves and Paris Saint-Germain but one nil to Bayern on aggregate tomorrow night on five live sport we're going to bring the Europa League commentary of Manchester United against Real Betis. Haven't got time to hear from Marcus Rashford but he said about their performance against Liverpool we didn't give up that's nonsense is there a difference Michael Brown between not giving up but their heads going. It looked like they give up quite a bit in the second half once it gets to a certain score line as a committal icing in that second half so yeah I understand what he means by saying no sort of professional footballer gives up but to have that score line you look at you look around and and you look at your teammates and you say what's happening if you got that certain bit of extra desire and those question marks fired around that team when that capitulation happened so it's a really obviously shocking second half and it's how they recover now it happens occasionally but it shouldn't happen in that type of game should it live up to be Manchester United chapter because it was such a freak result Chris do you have any doubts about how they respond tomorrow I think that I think it's a difficult game I think that's got to draw with with with room Madrid at the weekend and you know they're a capable team but oh look honestly it's you know the result because it was against a great rival in in Liverpool and there's that bad feeling within the game and it's a one-off total humiliation but you know when you consider where Manchester Manchester United were at the start of the season when Ted Tenhard came in difficult start but they've been on an incredible run as of late take that 45 minutes aside against Liverpool I think the mentality they'll have to show is there again but I still think they're heading strongly in the right direction under ten Hargan and they will prove that from now to the rest of the season. Okay teams are coming back out at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium so goalless in in Munich between Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain it's a very odd have you got that on on monitor Michael? I haven't had the game on no not at the game it's a very odd offside decision which would be based on whether Thomas he Thomas Muller is offside but I would imagine there's an argument and a debate about whether he actually touched the ball and from the screen out but it's very difficult to tell but that looked like what the argument may have been in Munich but that is still goalless and Bayern are going through on aggregate is finishing the women's super league between Arsenal and Liverpool and Arsenal have won 2-0 Chelsea lead Brighton 3-0 as they approach stoppage time there right massive 45 minutes for Tottenham and Frantonio Conte alongside Chris and Ian. Thank You Mark I had a message at half time from a wise football observer who said no two halves are the same but when the stadium announcer has just said to the supporters it's our biggest 45 minutes of the season you know what you have to do at first I was thinking I wonder if he's addressing that to the players who are waiting to come out and then he said give us the vocal support the vocal support hasn't been lacking Tottenham's adventure creativity and threat in front of goal has a long lay who got a knock in the chest by Juru has gone down holding his face and there's a stoppage in play now the side has made a change incidentally Forsters in goal for Spurs Romero Longley and Davis at the back three Emerson and Perichich, Poybier and Skipp in the centre of midfield Kuleseski, Kane and Son for Milan Mike Menon is in goal Kululu, Tamori and Chiao at the back three Messi and Hernandez at the wing backs right and left respectively Karani Ichin Tanali in the centre of midfield Diaz Liao and Olivier Giroud Spurs in the second half all in white are attacking the south stand those 17 and a half thousand supporters will try to suck them towards them as Spurs play from left to right the vocal support hasn't been found wanting tonight Skipps ball looking to be intercepted by Brahim Diaz nice footwork too he's gone now down that was Romero well Romero has been booked incidentally he has been and you can see the Milan players getting and then around the referee saying hang on it was Romero and Romero making a point of trying to help well he has helped Diaz up and apologising he needs to be careful there was a there was an outstretched left arm that just caught Brahim Diaz in the in the face another goal in a featured WSL game Kelly Summers yeah surely nothing more than a consolation for Brighton Chelsea three Brighton one Danielle Carter off the bench with a fifth of the season interim boss Amy Merrickson we pleased how they've not given up but they're not going to get any points from this time as we enter additional time Chelsea three Brighton one Arsenal have beaten Liverpool by two goals to nil five live final score is available tonight on the red button the iPlayer and the BBC sport app you can also listen to us through BBC sounds nil nil Kuleseski back to skip goes forward to Kuleseski runs forward out to Emerson Emerson's cross from the right flying header away by Tomori skip to Kuleseski there were cries of shoot there for skip after of course that he'd scored his first goal against Chelsea in that area of the field and he's 61st attempt ball spread out by Hoyby air to Kuleseski off the chest level the penalty area right hand side onto the left foot crosses dangerous ball in Perichich was there and the ball played forward by Emerson Kuleseski too far ahead of him tempo that's a maybe from Trottenham goal kick Chrisson well it's not good ahead of ourselves I mean it was a cross ball in from the right hand side left footed from Kuleseski or be a decent run across the near post but they need to be more creative in the second half well the decision there has gone against Ben Davis against Brian Diaz the crowd reaction they seem baffled he was just pulling the shirt actually it was a very good spot from the French referee in his ultra blue referees jersey Clemente Seltic still need hearts to one Rangers have fallen up at Easter road done the United level now at Livingston 1-1 in the Scottish Premier ship four minutes into the second half Spurs it's a tempestate kickoff are we to have an additional 30 minutes they need to score by a golden ill they have been decent at home they've won four of their last five with the exception being the North London Derby certainly got to put in a much improved performance in this second half as Romero has Kuleseski ahead of him again there was a reluctance to pass the ball early and forward Kane on the halfway line in field finds Huybierre in the centre circle Huybierre's diagonal ball reaches Kuleseski right hand side Kuleseski pulls it back skip plays it in low headed out by it's a really poor cross right good position but you just feel now within the stadium our building a little bit of momentum playing with the desired aggression here is Kuleseski running away from Teo Hernandez stepping out of defence was Chow wouldn't fall towards Son Kululu got a foot into the challenge and releases Hernandez and they've got Messi as away now on the right and Messi as pulls it back Brahim Diaz might come back a second chance he's still there very good save by Forster hooked away by Emerson only as far as Hernandez shoots left footed back in towards the out and out it goes through a goal kick that was a scare for Spurs 0-0 Well it was and just how big a save could this be in the context of this tie it's really well worked from Milan ball out right to Messi as feeds the ball to Diaz edge of the box Diaz side-footed the shot it comes back off a Tottenham defender he gets a break of the ball and from six yards out has Forster to beat and Forster big right shin keeps the ball out of the Spurs net big chance for Milan and Diaz not taken big moment in the game Fraser Forster keeps Spurs in the tie to go 1-0 down on the night and 2-0 on aggregate really would have been a tall order for Spurs Brahim Diaz looking for a goal early in the second half but it's his goal early in the first half from the first leg that still is the difference full-time now at Chelsea Kelly Southern Chelsea 3 Brighton 1 a guru right and penalty and strikes from Jess Carter and Johanna cannery it means Chelsea go within a points of the leaders man United for the two meet here on Sunday managers Brighton did get a late consolation by Daniel Carter but they remain just second bottom Chelsea 3 Brighton 1 and it's a latest score by and one Paris Saint-Germain nil Eric Supermoting a score just past the hour so by and now have a two goal cushion against Paris Saint-Germain changes being made here and it is going to be Pedro Porro coming on and it's Perisic who has gone off so he looked like he was hobbling off didn't he but he did have that heavy challenge in the very early on in the game so Emerson now has switched to the left-hand side and Porro straight away is not too impressed with T'Nali but they make up so Porro has come on for Perisic another defensive change nil Nill it remains the night of frustration in the Champions League for Tottenham Hotspur a season that is resting on Champions League glory and fighting for fourth Champions League qualification and exit here and another season without silverware and already of course many a question mark over Antonio Conte's future might well learn it just have the 12 games left of his tenure as Brahim de Atz challenge comes in on the diminutive Spaniard and it will be a free kick to Malat as he rides around in agony as I think no no that persistent drizzle continues to fall on this chilly night in Tottenham nine minutes into the second half it was actually son really careless in possession tried to play of all blind round the corner it came into him first time was committed by Emerson and a decent position this from Milan Messi has also gone down he's actually feeling his hamstring on his right leg so the Spurs supporters are brewing they think it's time-wasting tactics I'd imagine that Salamacas would come on to replace Messi that would be like for like Salamacas played there in the in the first leg in that position they might well have fallen away from the to challenge Napoli you think they were only eight points behind Napoli after the winter break and now they've dropped to fifth in Serie A and 18 points behind the runaway leaders but looking for the last eight in this competition for the first time in 11 years the only might be making that change down below certainly you can't really take a risk with a hamstring and Messi as I think he's going to be coming off they're indicating that the change needs to be made Salamacas absolutely spot on as you usually in might be one of the nicest things you've said to me Christopher that was sarcasm so Salamacas will be coming on the Belgian international to replace Messi as taking his time to get this substitution and here it comes that was a lengthy shot each and Messi asses off Salamacas is on with a hot skiff and a jump 12 minutes into the second half free kick remember for Milan ten yards in from the right touch line playing from right to left as we look good strong support from Milan in that corner to Nali to take it right footed Romero with a header away six yards out Salamacas will pick it up being chased by Kuleseski back towards Tomori Tomori has time then to pick his spot hits it right footed and that was a clear foul on the on Bendavis and it will be a Tottenham free kick on the edge of their penalty area at some stage Tottenham are going to have to throw caution to the wind Antonio Conte who like his two of his three central defenders was booked in that first half is barking out the orders the layoff by Son towards Harry Kane Harry Kane looking to get away from Tomori who dives in with his outstretched right foot out for a throw taking quickly on the right skip lets it come across him and as a result Smerza force back towards the halfway line for what goes to Hoibier spreads the ball out to Poro brings it under control near side the right Poro can't get past Hernandez it's a spur throw down by the corner flat showing a bit of urgency they know what's at stake you just wonder why this didn't happen earlier here is Romero wins that duel with Hernandez can't pick out Kuleseski there's all the urgency but they still haven't found the creativity trailing by a golden ill in the tie Hoibier to Davis forward ball to Kane Chao tight behind him Kane uses his strength clips it across to Poro Poro on the inside Tomori there first Tomori told to get up right rightly so riding around when there's no real challenge from the referee well the referee telling him to get up Conte telling Tomori to get up Hoibier wins the ball and went through the Milan half Kane he now goes to Brown gets a free kick I think he's played for that I do he takes a brilliant first touch but it's already on the way down let's have a look it may be wrong he's already on the way down Harry Kane that simulation but this is dangerous point of view 27 25 27 yard time what would you say right hand side of the box I'd say 25 it's right of center they need something special Poro is the one who's placed it down son is also there BBC Radio 5 live and BBC sound we're also on the red button for five live final score still no change in those three games and the Scottish Premiership or the other time the Champions League spur supporters listening to five live to this national exclusive radio commentary from inside the stadium will hope that something comes from this son is shielding the ball from the wall great noise inside the stadium it's for who's gonna hit it wait for the referee's whistle Poro runs up right footed into the top of the three-man wall Jiru clears it away the hour will give chase Hoibier lets the ball run down his chest and then with the back pass Emerson will pick it up just in front of his own penalty area we are an hour into the game and manual still hasn't had a save of note to make in the Milan goal half an hour remains dispersed to keep their hopes of silverware alive Poro fed forward to more it comes across out of play goes through throw another balls bouncing on to the pitch I think stop though by one of the substitutes Poro takes it short the throw to Kuleszewski Kuleszewski back behind Davis Rahim Diaz was putting him under pressure Davis slid to keep the ball back with Spurs now it's with Kuleszewski Poro right corner of the penalty area Poro's cross takes an inflection to Nali is back there to play it away up towards Jiru at no point in this game have Milan been really really stretched at the back yeah but you just sense it's Poro's come on this right-hand side he's gonna roast the crowd up with what's at stake Spurton and Hafton up the levels aren't they the crowd are upping their levels the players need to take part yeah they certainly do don't think there was ever any danger that the crowd wouldn't play their part when Antonio Conte called for an amazing atmosphere but come the Spurs players step up in a season of inconsistency five times this season they've suffered back-to-back defeats at no time have they suffered three on the spin but a draw will feel like a defeat with an exit from the Champions League Huybierre up towards Kane the layoff to skip forward ball cut out by Tamori to Nali marshalling that midfield with these expertise and Teo Hernandez runs into the challenge and that was Poro and it will be and Milan throw on the halfway line the fourth official had Antonio Conte to his right and if he'd have turned to his left and had gone eyeball to eyeball with the ball headed Milan coach Piolli so much riding on this game one goal would take us to time if Tottenham could find it the Milan supporters all in black a bouncing up and down in unison behind that goal away towards our left hand side Spurs supporters very little to bounce about hopping mad maybe the song just a little bit too far ahead of him Salamacus wins the challenge on that far side the right Spurs win it back there is that desire they need to show the quality in that final third that has so far been lacking here is Kuleseski to skip now Longley tracked by Tarnali Romero gotta be careful Liao was putting him under pressure goes back to his goalkeeper Fraser Forster and Forster hits it away downfield left footed little flick on by Emerson now playing on that far side the left you don't have the San Siro but it's Italian voices you can hear this Poro with a switch of play searching diagonal ball finds Son controls it well Son been subdued so far cross takes an inflection wouldn't quite reach Kuleseski to Maury was there to clear up to Orseru recovery from skip Spurs win it back Kuleseski to Kane side on to goal looking to turn gets the shot away by Foul to Hoivier Hoivier looks for a sighted goal Hoivier's cross that was better touched over in the air posed by Menon he's got to get a shot off earlier though I think initially when the ball comes to the Hoivier edge of the box he takes a touch under pressure from Tarnali but should have got his shot off and then he drives in the angle against him and Menon does make a save at his near post just over his head he tries to whip the crowd up the crowd have been waiting for the players can't fault the crowds enthusiasm Poro with a corner little flick head up bounces away comes out to the left side Poro once again on the right good teasing ball in two players went for the same ball it was Kane and Longley cleared away on that far side it'll be an uncontested drop ball in favour of Milan 25 minutes remaining for Spurs still 0-0 Milan player down to Maury, Maury is it? inside his own box they actually didn't defend the corner well because the right footed out swing of Ben Davies gets across the near post and as the ball comes out across comes in Harry Kane just cannot get his head on the ball in Scotland it's Livingston 1, Dundee United 1, Rangers still lead Hibbs by four goals to one and another goal at Celtic ready for side and it's the one that makes sure that Celtic will maintain their nine-point lead, Cian Hanksabanovich coming on as the substitute, Harps allowed them to wander across the edge of the penalty there suddenly there was an opening he exploited it fine-cuddling shot Celtic three-hards one and Bayern still lead Paris Saint-Saint-Germain by a goal to 0-2-0 on aggregate then as here is Brian Diaz picking up a loose ball running forward edge of the area he's got the run of Salamac as instead he waits for Liao his shot right footed strikes from Aero it'll be picked up by Tnali this is the worry now because Milan might be able to strike on the counterattack when Spurs are going in search of the goal that they so badly crave what a touch from Giroudo the stunning first touch outside of the left foot foot was spin on the ball in behind him to Liao he read the spin and Milan had a good break came to nothing Khrunyach back to Tamori and now all the way back to Mike Menon who plays a diagonal ball to Chow midway through the Milan half Tamori back towards his goalkeeper one touch up his right foot hits it long downfield we're almost midway through the second half it's still goalless in this second leg is here is Liao combining with Hernandez back towards Liao Liao enters the penalty area Liao prods it Brahim Diaz waits to turn Diaz shot deflected Giroud saved by Forster Foghild initially but he made the save why did Diaz not shoot first time as the ball was crossed in as a lovely one two from Liao and Hernandez Liao's little step over pokes the ball with his right boot to Diaz who could get a shot off uncontested 12 13 yards out takes a touch and Spurs scramble ball out left and Giroud the angle against him fires a shot straight up Forster Harry Kane finds Son edge of the area breaks out to skip plays it towards Emerson Emerson now on the left left corner the area onto his right foot curls over the cross Hernandez took him heads it away Poro says this one's mine right corner the penalty area plays it to Kula Sechke fires over the cross on the stretch away is Tamori Huybier lifts it back every outfield player in the half away towards our right hand side when midway through the second half you listen to five live it's nil nil Poro with the cross Harry Kane with a stooping header he must have been about six inches off the floor as he flew himself to the ground well-wide goal kick nil nil unlike Harry Kane to misjudge the flight of the ball Poro who's made a real difference whips the ball in and Kane balls much the on the floor when he heads it he knows that was the wrong decision a poor decision from him started to really open up now had to Richarlison is going to be coming on that was an excellent sliding challenge made by by Skip no foul says the referee skip runs forward Richarlison waiting to come on then for a rare for top man Teo Hernandez is still down it's not a head injury it's not a head injury yet the French referee has stopped play and you can certainly sense and understand the gripe that the supporters have with that with Teo Hernandez if everybody did that we'd never get frustrated yeah yeah you're clearly frustrated the Spurs fans have frustrated the Spurs venture all up in arms the brilliant challenge by Skip it was a strange decision when it comes to Richarlison it's Emerson coming off so Emerson is that well that would indicate they're going to go to a back four David Stendall play left back long lay and Romero and Poro was the as the right back this has been a note passed by Richarlison to Romero why doesn't he just tell it it's quite odd isn't it well i'm no tactical mastermind but we worked it out from here 20 minutes away so son actually has gone quite wide on the left Richarlison up along Harry Kane Kulesevsky at the minute is in a central area here is Son something needs to happen 15 years without silverware could be another season even then the Champions League was a long shot for Spurs giving this chance to some of the sides still in it as their ball has been lifted forward towards Leowen Leowens is the penalty area and on the half he clips it over the top on the run right footed goal kick Neil Lill that's the danger and Leow has a blistering pace that high Spurs back line Romero did well ran alongside him Leow got the shot off but was under pressure well over the bar here is Kulesevsky running central area to Richarlison Richarlison to Poro Poro with a shot always on the rise right footed 25 yards out over the top into the south stand and 19 minutes remain and it is still Neil Mill Paul from Poro leaning back they have just really lacked that composure in the final third and the quality has been required it's not been there yet haven't created enough haven't tested Milan enough haven't asked enough questions but there is still time with 18 minutes for that to change just skip charges forward out to Kulesevsky Kulesevsky on the right wins a corner kick for Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham looking to knock at that Milan door might be asking too much to win it in the 90 with the two goals that they require but a one-nil score line would take us into extra time Poro with a corner kick near side the right left arm aloft out-swinger headed out by Schaou headed further away by Salomakas comes to skip hits it forward it'll be claimed by Mike Menion full time at Easter Road have gone Rangers 4 convincing win now for Rangers despite an early goal giving Hibs the leading own goal with Porsche James Savner penalty and a fruitful partnership between Antonio Ciolek and Fashions of Cala produced another three Hibs stay five points behind Harj and forth and their seven game unbeaten run is over Hibs one Rangers four Livingston one Dundee United one is also a four-time score so Dundee United now three points behind Kilmarnock down there at the at the bottom of the table Charleston there and up to his old tricks as that ball was hooked back in from central area from skip and Jan claimed the ball comfortably Rich Charleston just followed through into him left a bit on him Kulesewski the familiar voice of Chris Sutton on BBC Radio Five Live Rich Charleston gets a free kick the challenge from Chow with Charleston in the the referee's coming under a lot of pressure now there's so much at stake with 17 minutes remaining and it's still goalless yeah he turned the wrong way though Rich Charleston he turned inside on his right foot and Son was free on the left hand side had he turned the other way but Spurs have a free kick can this be the moment there needs to be one certainly song to take it it's a good way out over 30 yards out the free kick right foot it curls it forward Kane's at that far post he gets a corner kick he's Hernandez jumping in front of him out of play it goes for a throw those 17 and a half thousand Spurs supporters who in that banked tier towards our right hand side are willing Spurs on 16 minutes of normal time remain and it's still 0-0 song to take the corner kick and it curls all the way over the top onto the roof of the net out for a goal kick that pretty much sums up Son's season doesn't it really does climb yet an opportunity where Tottenham have created very very little in the game good opportunity crowded box from the corner kicking he whips it on top of the net Brahim Diaz challenged by skip ball played forward to Kane but he's outside the centre circle of the Milan half still looking for the goal to level the tie Kane plays the ball towards Hoibierre Davis will go on the overlap Hoibierre waits 30 yards out from goal to Porro Porro sending across up in the air it goes Harry Kane and Tamori bouncing ball out of play corner kick to Tottenham used his body well there Harry Kane Tamori thought about going and attacking the ball as it looped up into the air coming back onto the pitch now there are two balls on the pitch there's three balls on the pitch the multi-ball system didn't work at all and then all of a sudden there were too many so Porro to take the corner kick on the right and the quarter of an hour remains in its nil nil Porro right footed out swinger over the head of Richarlison out of the penalty area it goes picked up by Son, Son midway through the Milan half back towards skip the last remaining outfield player on the edge of the centre circle down onto his haunches in frustration his Conte out to his technical area Svers being patient onto that left hand side cross lifted in gathered in by Menon full-time minute Celtic right off the side for the second game succession Celtic come from behind in this case to Josh Chinelli of hearts after only six minutes a fine header cancelled by a sliding shot by Danzin Maida both goals required the air checks both scorers went off to do the place by Jota Maida the second half saw Celtic assert themselves with a cute angle drive by Keogh and a spectacular finish for Haksar Banevic 3-1 victory in Costa Conqueror's 100th game in charge he's going to go here he's going to go we could have trouble here Romero catching Hernandez the Milan bench we're pleading for a yellow card and Romero has been shown a second yellow and then the red will follow he was booked in the first half he himself is in the technical area actually of the Milan dugout but Hernandez is down but when he gets to his feet he will be shown the red card by the French referee and Svers are going to have to do it the hard way well he's so so reckless from Romero he spoke didn't we about the early booking putting himself under pressure and he gambled on a challenge with Hernandez had to win the ball Hernandez went past him he flew in took Hernandez out who's still down and the referee has absolutely no choice it's an easy decision it is a second yellow and Svers guess what they've shot themselves in the foot the red card is out he's just waiting to brandish it Romero is getting treatment in the Milan technical area I think it's one of those where Romero knows he hasn't timed it I might be wrong I hope Romero is okay but I think he knows that it's a mistimed reckless challenge and he's trying to play the referee there but his mind's made up yeah nobody's fooled there well regular observers of Serie A would know about the aggressive style of Christian Romero 39 yellows and three reds in 102 Serie A games for Atalanta and there is the red card and that's the third dismissal in his Tottenham career his second of the season Romero is sent off and with 12 minutes remaining Tottenham Hotspur needing a goal a down to 10 men Turpan or Turpin stands and delivers the second yellow well Sanchez he's going to be coming on so they're going to have to sacrifice somebody here now Antonio Conte and it's all going horribly wrong for Tottenham Hotspur what's a really stupid challenge though from Romero plays on the edge doesn't he yes he does but that's just a really poor decision you know he knows he's on a yellow card so at the moment they've gone to Porro, Longley and Davis as a back three a skip towards Son sliding in was Kalulu Salamaka's on that right hand side he won't get the better of Ben Davis he stood up to the challenge well finds Hoyby air Hoyby air now to skip back out it goes to that left hand side 10 minutes remaining Kane picking it up and running forward but in the end it was Creniac who just came across and in the end he's rudely tackled by Harry Kane Byron have got a second goal as well so Byron three nil up on aggregate now against Paris Saint-Germain it's very hard to work out what system Tottenham are playing now it looks like Kulessevsky has gone back into a right back position is Richie Arleson getting fired up again Serge Gnabry has got that clinch up for Byron in the 89th minute so they will join Chelsea and Benfica in that quarterfinal draw so Benicera is going to be coming on the former Tottenham player and we're also going to see Divock Origi who's going to be coming on two for the closing 10 minutes Divock Origi who of course scored against Spurs in that Champions League final for Liverpool four years ago it's Origi for Olivier Giroud and it was Benicera who's come on for Brahim Diaz so that in many ways is just to shore up that that midfield as Brahim Diaz an attacking option being taken away by Benicera who returned at the weekend after being out since late January with it with a five problem central midfielder Ishmael Benicera the Algerian international but Milan with Leal Spurs just have to hope for one moment but it's certainly not easy when you down to 10 men here now is Tamori all cut out by Kuleszewski, Hoivier lifted forward then up towards Somme Spurs big-name players haven't delivered Somme yesterday in the press conference talked about we've got to give it everything well they've lacked quality as it's going to be a quick free kick that Kuleszewski will take and it's played out now to that far side for Davis but Milan win the ball back Salamakis the interception though from Davis on that far side back it goes then to Harry Kane who wins it down by the corner flag goes down into the challenge the referee will give the free kick to Tottenham Chrisson yeah well Kane doesn't need invitation to go down I think he dives again Harry Kane he does does make contact not enough contact to go down but there's the substitution boo that decision from Antonio Conte they were boo's for Sanchez coming on for Kuleszewski well they won't be booing if he scores off the set piece so Kuleszewski is off Sanchez is on I mean this this delivery is so so important I am with the numerical advantage Porro over the ball left hand side of the box this will be an in-swinger from the free kick not even six yards up from the byline Porro takes the deflection off the head of Salamakis it will run through to Harry Kane Harry Kane plays it towards Somme to Sanchez Sanchez Gaube Hernandez the repealing for a penalty strong penalty appeals more from the crowd actually than the Tottenham players as Leal runs forward it will be checked by VAR Leal strong running Leal enters the penalty area it'll fall to Tnali tried to place it block him in from Porro who did well Sanchez went down it wasn't a big protest from him as the protest from the thousands of Spurs fans from within the stadium what a chance from Tnali at the other end though blocks I think it was it long late I think it was Porro Porro blocks it Porro got back big chance took his time tried to pick his spot and feed the ball into the far corner Mars Fraser forced from a central area they've wasted some opportunities haven't they Milan they certainly have they've actually had the better chances I think Christian Stelini may have asked the fourth official there was a dismissive waiver the hand for from the fourth official so got the impression there that the VAR had seen nothing in that penalty appeal from Tottenham this is all they've got now Spurs balls up to Kane Richarlison knocked down football here is Sanchez to head it forward they've just got to go direct Benissar coming forward now as it goes to Salamakas five minutes of normal time they've lacked ideas they've lacked imagination this Tottenham hot spur aside and for a game which was we're just seeing this penalty appeal from Tottenham that is Sanchez gets to the ball just in front of Hernandez there's no contact Sanchez goes down well Antonio Conte could just have a dozen games left of his Spurs tenure and his record once again is one of underachieving when it comes to the Champions League. Teo Hernandez to Liao Liao can't find a way through left corner of the area he will still run forward he holds onto the ball does Liao they doubled up on him in Poro and Skip but Liao gets away from both of them and finds Tanali Tanali tried to nudge it back into the path of Liao there was Skip up towards Harry Kane four minutes remaining Harry Kane holds onto the ball, Boivier up towards Richie Richie wasn't convincing trail the leg and it just bounced off his heel and at no point did you really feel that Spurs were going to trouble Milan there Benissar shoots from distance. He's been strike that 30 yards out things why not not a lot of movement up ahead of him and forced it gets down to his left hand side and makes the save Antonio Conte as the ball was up there to Harry Kane his sixth season in the Champions League only once in his previous five has he gone past the last 16. Juventus to the quarterfinals Chelsea the last 16 into two group stage campaigns to match one of the group stages when he was in Turin and failing to deliver here with Tottenham Assont picks up the ball on that left corner of the area three minutes remain of normal time up towards Richie, heads in in front of Hernandez to Poro his header back towards Richie looking to turn right corner of the area but Tanali who's been terrific from Milan breaks it up Sanchez lifts it forward and that's cleared away by Salamakis and Bayern have beaten Paris Saint-Germain by two goals to nil so they are through winning three nil on aggregate and it looks like we will know the first quartets of the last eight lineup and it will only include one English representative that of Graham Potters Chelsea joining Benfica, Bayern and Milan and Stefano Piolli who won Milan's first title since 2011 with their title last year the Italian champions are looking for a first appearance in the quarterfinals of this competition in 11 years. He called it though I mean it's not over yet but Piolli said Spurs won't surprise us actually haven't laid a glove on Milan The bleak winter's night was the feel approaching the stadium tonight and it's certainly got that bleak outlook as far as Tottenham are concerned Rebic is going to be coming on Ante Rebic and Liao the player will go off and again a substitution that just reeks of Piolli to Stifling Tottenham who you could probably count the amount of chances on one hand and all the talk yesterday from Son and Antonio Conte in the press conference have actually just proved to be quite hollow. Save our season this was for Spurs they have the biggest issue I think the endeavor has been there in fairness the lack of quality the lack of creativity and the stupidity from Romero by my watch we're entering the last 60 seconds of normal time the fourth official will be interesting although some cynics might suggest Tottenham could play for another half an hour and still they would not score such as being the lack of opportunities that they've created for what was their biggest game of the season here is Rebic loses out to Sanchez on the stretch to the right of the centre circle is Hoibier. Poro now runs forward Poro faced by Hernandez. Hernandez comes across out of play it goes for a throw all eyes on the fourth official down below Jeremy Pinyard who only now is entering the digits six minutes have added on time. Easily interception by Salamacas at right wing back inside now towards Euregi. Euregi in the centre circle holds onto the ball and passes it out towards Benissaire. Benissaire to Salamacas. At that pass from Ben Davies something's up Spurs evening doesn't it? Short misplaced. T'Nali leads it towards Hernandez and now T'Nali on this near side the left back towards Hernandez Spurs chasing desperate to get hold of the ball and they're going to have to maybe try and summon up something from when they snatch that dramatic finish in Marseille with the down to ten men here. The ball is played forward and it's Euregi trying to get the shot away that was blocked by Sanchez on the edge of the area. Back pass towards Fraser Forster. Futsi's left foot through that and easily headed away by Chow. Poro will then foul Rebic. We talk about playing into Milan's hand. Poro hacking down Rebic. I've got to say the three young centre halves of Milan being this evening have been superb. They've barely put the foot wrong. Tamarion Chow and Kalu Lu. Marseille's Kainan co very very well. The iconic stadium of San Ciro will be hosting quarterfinal football in Europe's elite competition again unless something extraordinary dramatic happens in the next four minutes. I've added on time here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Nil Nil. And Tottenham Hotspurt. With Harry Kane back with Skip to Hoyby Air. Hoyby Air taken out by Chow. Chow will be booked. A yellow card taking one for the team. 30 yards out from goal. Free kick. It requires something very very special. Talk that up didn't I? It's not what a good game Chow has had but that's careless from him and this looks like Tottenham's best bet set play. A very deep for the Milan line. I don't know about Chow. It might be a Reba Dercci. As far as Tottenham Hotspur are concerned with three minutes remaining. Nil Nil. Very deep that Milan defensive line. It is. Usually deep. Free kick. 30 yards out. Son to take it. Harry Kane with a header. What a save by Mike Marion. Full stretch away towards his right-hand side. Low gets down. The best opportunity that Tottenham have created but now there's a counter attack. It's Hernandez to Origi. Origi in the penalty area. Hits the post and bounces into the arms of Fraser Forster. Drama at both ends. It's a brilliant save. Mentioned Milan and how deep the back line was. There were eight yards from their own goal and Harry Kane gets a glancing header. Manion down to his right-hand side. Makes a brilliant save. Then at the other end Origi strikes a ball off the left-hand post of Forster and Forster. Juggles the ball. Catches it and spurs now back on the attack. Ball pumped into the penalty area. Sanchez trying to flick it on. Poivier is there. Two minutes remain. Sanchez with a cross. Just agonisingly over the head of Son and Milan clear. Kaluulu up towards Tnali. If he can ride the challenge he's fouled by Skip. That's going to be another yellow card but Milan don't care. Tnali has been terrific for Milan. The Italian international winning a free kick and eating up valuable seconds. Yeah he's had a very very strong game. Good defensive instinct. Screened his back line well. Good use of the ball just seeing that Harry Kane again has all whipped in from a central area. A decent glance on that Harry Kane. Manion eventually really worked an excellent save. Tassarooshanu who had an eye operation during the World Cup. Sometimes it necessarily been questioned with some of his goalkeeping but the experience of Manion has certainly come to Milan's aid there as the ball is pumped out of play over on that far side and we're now entering the last 60 seconds. One more minute remains and Milan have a throw on the right hand side. To dare is to do to dream. Those dreams are going to be in tatters for Tottenham. Well another trophy-less season by the looks of it. Ball hit long by Davis for Charleston in that challenge with Tamori. Knotted on. Hoibier was there. Put out of play by Chao. Now or never. 25 seconds remain. Son combining with Davis. Davis low balling from the left and there at the back is Krunjic to clear it long. Rebic will give chase and by my watch we have 10 seconds remaining and Rebic will now try and outstretch long leg. But there is the final whistle and a chorus of boos as Tottenham-Hotford crash out to the Champions League. No happy ending for Conte. And another season without Silverware for Spurs. What a disappointing way to exit Europe's elite competition. 0-0 on the night. Milan celebrate their first appearance in the last eight since 2012. 1-0 they go through an aggregate. And there are ways to go out of the Champions League. But tonight Tottenham just did not perform such a disappointing performance from them. It was really flat in the final third. The only save which Manon had to make was in extra time from the free kick from the Harry Kane. Glancing head out by. I thought Milan came here with a swagger. They are a team of really poorly away from home this season. But Spurs did not start well, did finish well. And this season is not going to end well once again. They have taken a step backwards this season. Too little, too late. And it is another season without any trophies for Tottenham-Hotspur. They are out of Europe. They are left just fighting for Champions League qualification. As the Milan players celebrate with the supporters on that far side, it is finished goalless and Milan go through to the quarter-finals. Tottenham fans make correctors here Ian. But I can't remember as angry a reaction from Tottenham fans at the end of the game under Antonio Conte. Can you? No, but I think it has been brewing. Not just because of the lack of consistency this season. But the style of football. The style of football is not the Tottenham way and the supporters have had their fill coinciding with the exit of the FA Cup last week for what was a competition that is crying out to be won for a club like Tottenham-Hotspur. When you think of the few Premier League representatives who were left in it. And then to go out in this manner where they lacked an adventure and ambition in the first half didn't create enough opportunities. So I think it has just come to a head and also as well they've got a manager who doesn't want to commit. They know that the manager is not going to be here at the end of the season and I think everything now is coming to their head and I think this now is for Spurs as a football club. They are now, well they're in a crossroads, they need to, they've got to make the call because they've got a plan, they've got a plan for the future and there's a lot of questions that now need to be asked. What do you mean they've got to make the call? What about the manager's future? Well it's all about recruitment. Why, yes you've got still top four to five four but if the manager is not going to be here next season why don't you try and say right okay. But is the manager driving recruitment? I mean they've got a director of football so presumably the manager isn't solely driving the recruitment. That's on Parateaching now. Yeah so Parateaching now and the hierarchy of Tottenham-Hotspur have got to address which direction Tottenham-Hotspur are going to want to go in. You could bring in a manager now who could assess the playing squad with the 12 games that remain in the Premier League and then no with Parateaching a joined up approach know exactly how you're going to target next season. Or do you wait until till May and then say okay now we're going to make the decision. I'd agree with what Ian's saying there Mark because they have to make a decision in which direction the club is going in and I know Conte's had a really difficult time recently and you know his first game back today but there needs to be clarity moving forward. There are a lot of unhappy Spurs fans within this stadium this evening. They've been unhappy with the season's performances. They were you know they were maddened by the Spurs team which was picked against Sheffield United going out against Lower League a Lower League opposition. But tonight wasn't good enough against a team I think many Spurs fans have viewed as beatable. But at least if you're going to go out don't go out with a whimper. One I think once the Milan goalkeeper was worked in injury time deep into injury time. There's a real lack of creativity within this Spurs team. What direction of the club going in? You know it's okay you know they're competing for another Champions League place but if you're not going to compete in the Champions League when you have a genuine chance as they had tonight. Spurs fans you know I can understand the frustration. Michael Brown with us as well. James Horncastle obviously covers Italian football and Saria tweeted I'm surprised Conte hasn't been able to bend this team to his will and impose his mentality on it and then went on to say this is the most insipid Conte team since he briefly got a crack at Atalanta his first top flight gig. Insipid is the word isn't it? It's amazing really obviously we've seen an improvement when Conte first went to Inchappers but then to be like this I've always thought with this uncertainty of the future of the manager. I think what Denner was saying there let's be sure let's see which direction they're going to go make that decision now. Is the manager going to be with them next season or is he not? I've seen Daniel Lever look for a bounce in results before 12 games to go and try and make the Champions League. He might feel his right decision to do that now and I thought he was looking really really likely that he wasn't going to be here next season and then literally somebody from the Spurs Camp said to me that's his way he waits till the end of the season. I was a little bit sort of puzzled with that type of reaction but today you look at their performance with what was on the line for it and there was no near as high as intensity what you would expect. Desire running forward it was too little too late and the Romero challenge with his experience right on the byline pretty much summed up the day but it started too slow in the first half Jaipur's. Well yeah I mean I did see I did see one message from Tim Spears who covers Tottenham for the Athletic. You said I've watched Papa John's trophy ties that I felt like they've had more riding on them in that first half which is a very good description of that first 45 minutes. Romero Chris doesn't help Antonio Conte but and people within football could try and bamboozle us with tactics and formations and this and that and so on and so forth but quite simply Romero gets sent off you are one nil down on aggregate you have 10 minutes left to make it through to the Champions League quarterfinals and you persist with wanting your three at the back or whatever and you bring Kula Sestioff and bring Davison Sanchez on. Explain it because adversely every football family will be utterly bemused by that substitution. Yeah it was strange I mean you know the irony was they won a free kick didn't they and the free kick actually on the left hand side Poro took it it wasn't a good free kick but you know you'd argue Sanchez is better in the air than Kula Sestioff but in terms of needing a moment of magic a bit of creativity that didn't make sense you know just just touching on Romero though what's what an idiot really I mean you know he always plays on the edge but I mean he's absolutely killed his team this evening the fact that you know he just has to show a bit of nerves a bit of discipline you know so Impet just wanting to get to the ball he knows is on a yellow card and if he's gonna make a late challenge you know he knew that he'd you know it'd be sent off that was stupid the game was up then and in the end all Spurs had was was long balls up to Kane and Richard Allison and what was the reaction like Chris sorry since what was the reaction like in that stadium was their anger all around they sort of seemed there was that booing that sort of does it look really like it's going to be into you know no way back for Conte and how do you pick the players up I don't look I'm not so sure it's one of those words it was it's not easy to judge whether there's no way back for Conte I think that Ian absolutely nailed it Spurs fans now want clarity on you know what is what is the way forward now you know it's just competing for the top four and up it doesn't help when Arsenal are absolutely flying their their biggest rivals but it's about it's always been this season from the way I've seen Spurs about their performance levels and the performance levels haven't been there all season and Spurs have always prided themselves on on Spurs fans have always prided themselves on being entertained and this season it has been utter dross and that's that's the biggest issue and we heard the feeling at the end of the game this this wasn't a great Milan team by any stretch of the imagination it was a winnable game but you know as Ian said again you know before the game all all the talk most important game of the season Conte saying that he's got the energy you know this this being the defining game for Spurs and they and they put up that show that was awful can you explain that substitution Michael I'll look and say honestly you're looking at you think you're a scenario threat they're going to put the ball in the box a little bit more I mean I don't know but you can see straight away the supporters whatever he does there they're already dead against him aren't they for what types of decisions he's gone on and made and it's just a really another like really frustrating performance I'm watching it I'm thinking go on have a go try and put it into some areas and you look at those changes last week against Sheffield United it was for this game wasn't it you're looking in saying that's the build-up this is the biggest game that they've got to produce yet they stayed very very safe as we said really what was the attacking options from Milan away from home being really really poor it was a game they could have went on it was too little too late towards the end of the game here's a message what can I just say Mark just on on Kuleszewski though Kuleszewski looks a shadow of the player which yeah you know he was a you know a few months ago and and son this season I mean they have been miles off the pace so look Kuleszewski didn't have a great evening but it was it was well he's more he may not have had a great evening and he may not be in great form but he's he's more likely to create something than Davison Sanchez isn't he yes I'd agree thanks Ian we got this message from John you have to look at this season as a failure now even if we make the top four when you consider where us and asked were at the end of last season and compare the impact to the signings there's have been good all hours have flopped were stagnant which is another good word to go along with in Sippit that we had earlier but the question would remain you know everybody busts their gut to make top four but why bust a gut to make top four if you're going to go out in such a flat way although the obvious answer is money yeah but the supporters want the glory and that is what Tottenham's tradition is all about it's about a style of football and it's about the the glory and it's 15 years without success and I think this this is just a culmination of things it was worth saying before and Michael and Chris have both touched upon it it stems a lot from from last week at Bramble Lane I listened to 606 and there was a caller who was saying after they lost to Sheffield United that they would have preferred to have played a stronger side for that game a weak and team for the following game in the Premier League got through in the FA Cup you know there's no guarantee that they're going to get top four Liverpool now are coming with it with a run that's what the Tottenham fans wanted but I've seen them here and they haven't played good football the Spurs supporters are not being entertained and that frustration is boiled over at the end because also as a football club there are a lot of questions for the for the the hierarchy to answer what was calling about the Sheffield United defeat was it was like the the club's hierarchy or that or the management team didn't understand the fans on that on that evening you know that they didn't that which is that's a pretty catastrophic error really isn't it because you know touch touch upon at the start of the show that Spurs fans want trophies give yourself the best chance of doing that when you say hierarchy Chris when you say that do you know you're saying above Conte are you saying Conte because of you watching the European managers they would want the Champions League really than one of the Carabao Cup stroke FA Cup I'm sure they'd be looking at it's slightly different to possibly us well I don't think Spurs can be that arrogant after being trophy-less or you know barely winning a trophy and but you know you have to you have to understand what your what your fans want and I think that look however whoever made that decision it must have been Conte to pick the team against Sheffield United then that was that that was a really poor one and that put the pressure on on tonight's performance and and they didn't turn up hence why there's so much anger but Chris I do go back to Ian's point that it wasn't a team of 19 year olds that they put out at Sheffield United did their front three that evening were Lucas Mora Rich Arleson who was Brazil's number nine at the World Cup and Son who was at the World Cup who's who's Tottenham's best player well Harry Kane where was he on the bench he was on the bench yep absolutely so that that so there are one man so there are one man so there are one man team well a one man forward line pretty much this season aren't they but that you know that was that was the wrong decision you know bring him on when you when you when you're struggling to try and turn things around start him get ahead and then take him off that's that's that's that's that's a you know admission that they got it wrong the fact that they have to bring him on you know earlier on Mark you use the word they've stagnated you could actually say spurs of regressed and then if you assess the wider picture and we're talking now about what's the future of Antonio Conte the other ramifications are is that there are a number of players this season who have not performed and then equally Harry Kane might be thinking well I tell you what I want trophies and I'm not going to get them here at Tottenham Hotspur so Harry Kane now might be leaving as well and then all of a sudden spurs have gone even further back because they've lost their best player tell you what we keep throwing all these different words out but you might we you might end up as a guest on Dictionary Corner on Collins countdown aren't you because he'll be listening to that and he'll be thinking you might be perfect for a stint on countdown I might suggest that to Colin in a little arm I would love that I'm so honestly it'd be brilliant he'll be here at half past ten so we'll we'll suggest that you might want to try carefully we're calling at the moment Mark I would imagine why you know is light with these little films we've moved on from Sunday although that does bring me on to this point Michael thank you for that from Callum who says Conte doesn't want to be there and I don't want to watch his team and I think look from a human being perspective nobody can really put themselves in Conte shoes and imagine what he's gone through over the last 12 months with the loss of three people close to him and the health issues that he's had and having the operation and stuff but fans can tell can't they when a manager doesn't want to be there you you will have seen it up here I mean you've mentioned Manchester United but United fans felt like that towards Marino Marino always gave the impression they didn't really want to be in Manchester at Manchester United and that's a big thing for fans it's a big call I had it with that's what actually was always with Spurs and it was Jack Santini Jappers and he was in the building big expectation here he is in his coming Daniel Levy's brought him in he couldn't get the type of backroom staff he wanted that he want you know and it was just becoming an absolute fast didn't want to be there it was a matter of time waiting for him to go and it becomes so so difficult you're looking across the training ground and and it's is it this is it this scenario that's going to end now that the manager doesn't want to be there he's not prepared to leave his finances Daniel Levy's saying well I'll wait I don't need to make the decision now and it's it's a standoff and that's the other option Chris yeah I'd you know I'd absolutely agree with with Michael I think the stuff on you know doesn't want to be there but you know he has been through a hell of a lot hasn't he can't say with you know with this operation and you know and in many respects he could have you know taken taken longer off but he wanted to front up tonight I actually admire him for doing that I mean you know his biggest issue is is the players on the pitch let him down I mean there are Spurs fans who will say well he lets us down with the way that he plays and it's negative they're set up but there are a number of Spurs players this season who simply just haven't turned up I mean Son has just fallen off a cliff hasn't he I mean what what has happened to him this season",
