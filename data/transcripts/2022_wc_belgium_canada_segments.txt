[0.00 - 6.88] P:1742.89 E:0.064760 |  Anustacio in midfield, Buchanan, Hoylert, Lariat, Nottingham Forest player who's currently
[6.88 - 15.00] P:1853.63 E:0.098483 |  on loan at Toronto FC and Jonathan David, the highly rated Jonathan David up front.
[15.00 - 21.44] P:1767.14 E:0.085184 |  So this is Belgium, Canada in Group F and the match begins and the ball is immediately
[21.44 - 28.26] P:1684.76 E:0.086756 |  played back to goalkeeper Boyan to our right, the Canadian side in the white shirts with
[28.26 - 33.90] P:1626.79 E:0.090574 |  the red numbers and Belgium in these rather vivid red shirts with the black sleeves, black
[33.90 - 36.70] P:1782.99 E:0.077391 |  shorts and black and red socks.
[36.70 - 43.06] P:1751.94 E:0.085856 |  So this is the fourth and final commentary today from here in the Gulf at this World Cup
[43.06 - 47.74] P:1612.25 E:0.088998 |  and it is the star studded Belgians, the team ranked number two in the world.
[47.74 - 52.58] P:1787.83 E:0.090990 |  Once again here they are setting out an attempt to win what would be Belgium's first major
[52.58 - 57.98] P:1703.52 E:0.091188 |  senior tournament title and it is the Canadians in possession inside their own heart but that's
[57.98 - 59.30] P:1568.32 E:0.085130 |  a poor pass.
[59.30 - 63.86] P:1784.40 E:0.105489 |  It's given away to Batuay and Batuay shoots for goal and it's deflected but it's deflected
[63.86 - 68.46] P:1679.06 E:0.101251 |  relatively close to Boyan the goalkeeper who's able to drop down to his left and hold onto
[68.46 - 69.46] P:1491.79 E:0.096868 |  it.
[69.46 - 72.14] P:1513.27 E:0.097691 |  I don't know whether that was nerves or what it was Dion Dublin but it wasn't very good
[72.14 - 73.14] P:1549.50 E:0.110151 |  from...
[73.14 - 76.78] P:1605.47 E:0.095693 |  No it wasn't and you can't make those kind of mistakes at all, not this early in the
[76.78 - 78.42] P:1586.02 E:0.094245 |  game anyway against the team right Belgium.
[78.42 - 82.50] P:1747.64 E:0.106063 |  You cannot, he has Junior Hoylert now on the left hand side, Junior Hoylert now of Reading
[82.50 - 86.38] P:1756.04 E:0.099276 |  taking the ball under the full back position, crossing for the near post and it is cleared
[86.38 - 87.38] P:1802.11 E:0.089249 |  away.
[87.78 - 91.26] P:1670.66 E:0.085146 |  The ball is blocked by the right hand side and now Jonathan David in the middle but
[91.26 - 96.26] P:1777.28 E:0.092475 |  they have it back Alfonso Davis, Alfonso Davis real quality there with the number 19
[96.26 - 99.86] P:1649.70 E:0.099805 |  on his back, cuts in field he's on his right foot, little ball towards the edge of the
[99.86 - 104.58] P:1672.67 E:0.087632 |  area, David turns it out towards the right hand side and now on the overlap Johnston
[104.58 - 109.30] P:1692.62 E:0.090521 |  tries to get the crossing, that is blocked by Carrasco, it bounces back to Alastair Johnson
[109.30 - 114.18] P:1772.90 E:0.099618 |  the right back and Canada this is much better from them, into the penalty area they go and
[114.42 - 118.42] P:1703.20 E:0.101476 |  well enough by Ustaccio the Porto man, the midfielder inside the box but it was blocked
[118.42 - 121.86] P:1651.91 E:0.100082 |  out source just a couple of yards away the Belgian defender and they were able to get
[121.86 - 127.90] P:1788.42 E:0.098103 |  it away so there we are in the first two minutes, Canada very very bad at the back but actually
[127.90 - 129.38] P:1736.83 E:0.093397 |  pretty good at the front.
[129.38 - 133.54] P:1594.74 E:0.098713 |  Yes sharp moving it about from the left hand side over to the right hand side two players
[133.54 - 139.18] P:1751.72 E:0.099526 |  combining well, little one two as well, last ditch defence from Belgium but they weren't
[139.18 - 140.70] P:1642.90 E:0.091677 |  expecting that in the first five minutes.
[140.70 - 146.22] P:1644.93 E:0.088775 |  No I bet they weren't so great day this for Canada making only their second appearance
[146.22 - 153.46] P:1727.96 E:0.087358 |  at a World Cup and their English coach John Herdman down there in Newcastle United supporter
[153.46 - 159.82] P:1669.97 E:0.086597 |  from County Durham and it looked like was that a late challenge on Fertonga the ball
[159.82 - 166.38] P:1709.44 E:0.084940 |  had already gone and it was late from Buchanan the midfielder but I think Fertonga will be
[166.38 - 167.38] P:1738.13 E:0.065827 |  okay Dion.
[167.58 - 172.42] P:1624.17 E:0.092585 |  Yeah he'll be fine just a bit of a body check there just caught him while his weight wasn't
[172.42 - 176.62] P:1653.62 E:0.086562 |  on his right foot knocked him over he's fine I was watching actually the warm up before
[176.62 - 182.02] P:1604.35 E:0.087534 |  the game started and Michy Bacciari looks very very sharp he put a few shots in the top corners
[182.02 - 187.38] P:1672.82 E:0.085473 |  as well so he is wanting to get on the score sheet as all good centre forwards will want
[187.38 - 190.46] P:1543.50 E:0.070718 |  to but he's looking sharp I feel for this defence tonight.
[190.46 - 196.02] P:1669.67 E:0.093340 |  Yep so it is 0-0 very early stages Bacciari in very decent goal scoring form for Fener
[196.02 - 200.06] P:1635.26 E:0.096922 |  Bacciari 8 goals this season but Canada have won the ball back and it's played out towards
[200.06 - 204.46] P:1649.10 E:0.091730 |  the right hand side Buchanan is there double step over from Buchanan of against Carrasco
[204.46 - 209.26] P:1524.68 E:0.095210 |  chosen by Roberto Martinez as the left wing back there was some debate over who that would
[209.26 - 213.98] P:1716.44 E:0.081438 |  be but it's Carrasco who got the nod and he's been able to concede a throw in on the far
[213.98 - 221.94] P:1634.82 E:0.074607 |  side so Alastair Johnson this well thought of right back Blontair short Blontair takes
[221.94 - 225.14] P:1587.40 E:0.091630 |  the throw but that's a poor touch actually from Hutchinson and the ball is out of play
[225.14 - 234.26] P:1776.63 E:0.072577 |  for a throw in to Belgium so yes tonight in Doha Canada become only the second team
[234.26 - 240.62] P:1647.36 E:0.077640 |  from their country to play at a men's World Cup and they have the chance tonight to become
[240.62 - 245.96] P:1783.23 E:0.084715 |  the first Canadian team to actually score a goal at the World Cup and to win a point
[245.96 - 250.94] P:1729.88 E:0.087099 |  at the World Cup and it is Belgium clearing the ball away with Fatonga who is okay Alderviro
[250.94 - 254.82] P:1726.86 E:0.088047 |  that bounces to left footed clearance from him on the edge of the box and then there's
[255.50 - 259.42] P:1698.39 E:0.087139 |  a foul on the halfway line by Batchewa he was putting it about a bit quite a physical
[259.42 - 264.82] P:1726.00 E:0.079669 |  challenge that Chouay sort of turns and points to his own chest as if to say to the referee
[264.82 - 265.82] P:1784.52 E:0.049250 |  what a foul.
[265.82 - 271.82] P:1643.91 E:0.079653 |  Yeah he sort of I think he called to Victoria there didn't even know he was there to be
[271.82 - 276.86] P:1815.73 E:0.076576 |  honest just turn he was there and he just caught his shoulder knocked him over referee
[276.86 - 278.54] P:1763.17 E:0.078891 |  pulled it back for a free kick.
[278.54 - 286.26] P:1474.34 E:0.087218 |  The referee by the way is Yanni Zikazoui of Zambia who you might remember from the Africa
[286.26 - 292.02] P:1664.85 E:0.090220 |  Cup of Nations earlier this year this was the referee who twice blew the final whistle
[292.02 - 298.70] P:1762.81 E:0.086114 |  early during the Tunisia-Mali match during the the Cup of Nations first in the 86th minute
[298.70 - 305.74] P:1601.72 E:0.081320 |  realized his mistake then said carry on and then actually blew the final whistle on 89
[305.74 - 311.30] P:1642.07 E:0.085546 |  minutes and 47 seconds when Mali were leading 1-0 it caused quite a fuss at the time and
[311.30 - 316.26] P:1443.44 E:0.091069 |  when I saw that he was refereeing this game I have to say I was slightly surprised but
[316.26 - 322.82] P:1699.85 E:0.082108 |  clearly FIFA have confidence in him otherwise he wouldn't be here and everyone makes mistakes
[322.82 - 324.74] P:1513.75 E:0.089464 |  even though that was quite a big one.
[324.74 - 326.58] P:1775.06 E:0.070156 |  Have you made a mistake on this?
[326.58 - 329.90] P:1553.47 E:0.071575 |  Yeah I have to make mistakes every day.
[329.90 - 337.02] P:1635.04 E:0.083522 |  Belgium NIL, Canada NIL, Victoria playing the ball back to goalkeeper Bojan who passes
[337.02 - 342.26] P:1603.55 E:0.075539 |  it out from the back and then the ball is deflected by Carasco out of play for a throwing
[342.26 - 343.26] P:1660.50 E:0.077380 |  to Canada.
[343.26 - 349.86] P:1723.98 E:0.082753 |  Actually the officials tonight is very very much a league of nations affair in that the
[349.86 - 356.06] P:1679.55 E:0.081721 |  referee is from Zambia the assistants are from Colombia and Algeria the fourth officials
[356.06 - 365.46] P:1672.71 E:0.071190 |  from Japan and the VAR the main VAR official is from Venezuela so they're hoping I think
[365.46 - 369.66] P:1656.67 E:0.064814 |  for international understanding between the officials tonight.
[369.66 - 373.10] P:1605.86 E:0.095076 |  Here it is with Belgium playing it forward towards the edge of the box that's headed
[373.10 - 378.26] P:1656.05 E:0.090062 |  away by Johnston it bounces down now for Carasco and Carasco turns but in comes the challenge
[378.26 - 384.18] P:1676.83 E:0.097115 |  on him good one as well it was to win it back for Canada from Ustakio and then Carasco tries
[384.18 - 387.98] P:1614.87 E:0.100020 |  to win it back but fails and falls on his backside and now Buchanan on the right hand
[387.98 - 397.38] P:1771.73 E:0.086330 |  side and his cross into the middle is actually deflected wide by junior Heilert.
[397.38 - 402.50] P:1771.86 E:0.096088 |  Fiery deflection and it is a corner to Canada but Buchanan's done well you're right actually
[402.50 - 404.00] P:1628.35 E:0.100025 |  Dion it was David wasn't it?
[404.00 - 410.06] P:1745.16 E:0.088158 |  Good chance by the way Jonathan David there just getting across then Donk at the near
[410.06 - 414.86] P:1753.05 E:0.080338 |  post just trying to anticipate getting to that ball first doesn't quite connect they
[414.86 - 419.54] P:1678.06 E:0.095983 |  get there at the same time that's a good chance a really good chance they're not sitting back
[419.54 - 422.82] P:1793.68 E:0.084458 |  they're not waiting for Belgium at all.
[422.82 - 428.50] P:1694.47 E:0.093279 |  So it's a corner from the right hand side junior Heilert to take this raises both arms steps
[428.50 - 435.18] P:1743.56 E:0.086015 |  away three four five strides first big set-piece chance for Canada nil-nil on five life Heilert
[435.18 - 439.70] P:1569.89 E:0.087011 |  waits and now here is the delivery with a corner it's a deep one towards the penalty spot it's
[439.70 - 446.02] P:1770.31 E:0.092518 |  taken down and shot Corbett's and deflected but took the pace off it the shot that was
[446.02 - 451.26] P:1705.03 E:0.088593 |  was hit well by Buchanan who's already caught the eye but it took the pace off it and Courtois
[451.26 - 454.98] P:1661.58 E:0.092051 |  in the Belgian goal just had to make a couple of steps to his left to catch the ball.
[454.98 - 458.50] P:1547.01 E:0.092420 |  Yeah it was it was it was more or less on the penalty spot two yards from the penalty spot
[458.50 - 464.02] P:1779.04 E:0.092754 |  and he just turns takes a touch smacks it through about three players it took about two deflections
[464.02 - 469.26] P:1710.44 E:0.087094 |  Courtois gone left he's gone right and just by chance the ball went to him.
[469.26 - 475.98] P:1677.80 E:0.083886 |  Well hang on the referee has stopped play and said that the AR is checking for a possible
[475.98 - 481.82] P:1742.68 E:0.098533 |  penalty a potential handball now I'm not sure about in fact the referee the referee is very
[481.82 - 487.14] P:1808.50 E:0.093517 |  quickly drawn the rectangle in the air and has been called across to have a look at the
[487.14 - 491.46] P:1764.49 E:0.087521 |  screen so I'm guessing we've not seen the pictures yet I'm guessing that that is Buchanan's
[491.46 - 496.34] P:1793.71 E:0.090070 |  shot that must have struck the arm possibly an outstretched arm maybe an arm above the
[496.34 - 504.42] P:1795.93 E:0.077522 |  head of a Belgian defender and we're seeing it now and Carrasco's arm is is out in front
[504.42 - 509.58] P:1756.51 E:0.082442 |  of his body and it comes off his wrist. It is it is and you know what it's actually it's
[509.58 - 515.02] P:1794.50 E:0.068873 |  a good strike it's going goalbound as well yeah and it has hit his left left wrist it's
[515.02 - 520.50] P:1882.62 E:0.087598 |  going into the right hand side of Courtois goal it hits his hand it is going goal would
[520.54 - 525.54] P:1606.48 E:0.090279 |  I think they're quite I think they're quite strong I think Juan Soto of Venezuela is quite
[525.54 - 530.94] P:1799.15 E:0.104846 |  clear he believes it's a penalty and yes there we are there is the decision Canada have been
[530.94 - 536.10] P:1720.27 E:0.101035 |  awarded an early penalty the video assistant referee has stepped in I think Carrasco is
[536.10 - 540.34] P:1686.29 E:0.093243 |  going to be shown a yellow card as well for that I'm not sure we knew a great deal about
[540.34 - 547.78] P:1770.96 E:0.080606 |  it in all honesty but he is yellow carded for it and it was goalbound and I think Jonathan
[547.78 - 554.74] P:1734.17 E:0.079132 |  David has already got the ball on the spot he's not going to waste any time here at all so Canada
[554.74 - 566.06] P:1737.41 E:0.062092 |  what an opportunity this is in the 10th minute in fact the Canada it's Alfonso Davis who has
[566.06 - 575.46] P:1740.28 E:0.073509 |  got the ball and he's put it on the spot what a moment this is here in Doha in 2022 Canada have
[575.46 - 584.50] P:1808.30 E:0.064774 |  a golden opportunity here to score their first goal at a World Cup but Alfonso Davis of Bayern
[584.50 - 592.98] P:1758.40 E:0.061206 |  Munich has to beat Tebow Courtois of Real Madrid this is a heavyweight penalty contest Alfonso
[592.98 - 601.10] P:1742.25 E:0.061345 |  Davis with his left foot has his eyes on the ball total concentration the stadium almost
[601.14 - 607.26] P:1852.39 E:0.071573 |  quiet as it waits for this huge moment a chance for Canada to take the lead against Belgium
[607.26 - 613.98] P:1860.21 E:0.079233 |  still he waits and now up he steps left footed and it's saved by Courtois and it comes back to
[613.98 - 619.58] P:1802.18 E:0.106099 |  Davis and he was impeded there was a teammate going for the same ball and he's hooked the
[619.58 - 626.50] P:1894.33 E:0.097369 |  follow-up high and wide and the chance has gone for Canada the chance has gone for Alfonso Davis
[627.02 - 632.62] P:1834.90 E:0.100731 |  and Tebow Courtois man of a match in the Champions League final remember saves from the penalties
[632.62 - 638.46] P:1891.28 E:0.088402 |  saves from the penalty spot down to his right pushing it away and it's a goal kick to Belgium
[638.46 - 644.78] P:1634.64 E:0.092148 |  the off-penalty it's a really poor penalty I mean I've taken a few penalties as well not at this
[644.78 - 651.54] P:1779.75 E:0.086655 |  level but when you put the ball down so early and you're waiting in your stud you can have so many
[651.54 - 655.38] P:1802.07 E:0.093592 |  thoughts going in your head I'd like to have the ball in my hand I'd like to wait till the last
[655.42 - 662.58] P:1756.05 E:0.079769 |  minute and prepare properly really poor penalty we know how good Tebow Courtois is at penalty saves
[662.58 - 667.90] P:1659.61 E:0.075699 |  and it's a really really bad one it's not even in the corner it'll be really disappointed with that
[667.90 - 676.10] P:1776.84 E:0.054569 |  no Venom no direction nothing at all such a disappointment for Canada can you imagine them
[676.10 - 683.82] P:1746.12 E:0.074420 |  all over that great that huge country televisions radios tablets you name it devices that would
[683.86 - 693.74] P:1776.82 E:0.071272 |  have been for them what a start all tuned into the stadium here the Ahmed bin Ali stadium and such
[693.74 - 699.02] P:1736.77 E:0.081630 |  disappointment here's Jonathan David though Canada bright coming forward Buchanan is challenged and
[699.02 - 704.42] P:1745.11 E:0.070992 |  then advances to Whitzel on the edge of the box and Belgium have got it back what a disappointment
[704.42 - 711.78] P:1826.55 E:0.064282 |  for Canada what a let-off for Belgium yeah it is a let-off actually Belgium was you know that
[711.78 - 715.58] P:1801.31 E:0.090788 |  they're actually just looking down to each of the now Vitzel's looking now looking at Tealemans and
[715.58 - 719.34] P:1797.27 E:0.083896 |  as if to say well let's just get the ball down let's just play for a bit get hold of the ball
[719.34 - 724.86] P:1740.84 E:0.069978 |  let's not force things and and Canada on the front foot they've had most of the ball as well in
[724.86 - 730.02] P:1721.71 E:0.077556 |  Belgium's final third yeah look really sharp coming forward and here they are on the right-hand
[730.02 - 735.10] P:1773.05 E:0.084756 |  side with Buchanan again who's seen a lot of the ball in the early stages and he wins a throw in
[735.10 - 741.54] P:1828.18 E:0.067455 |  off Carrasco so this is Tejon Buchanan who plays for Club Bruges who are one of the teams of the

[745.26 - 752.50] P:1828.25 E:0.074845 |  quickly and the shot is dragged wide from over on the on the right-hand side larry it is who just
[752.50 - 759.14] P:1667.20 E:0.072902 |  snatched it rather the Nottingham Forest man as he is is on loan as I say in Canada and it is a
[759.14 - 766.18] P:1701.98 E:0.072111 |  goal kick to Belgium they'll get they seem to be getting in in those sort of pockets in front of
[766.34 - 772.10] P:1689.82 E:0.076667 |  the back three of Belgium very easy turning and then picking a few one twos between each other
[772.10 - 778.26] P:1800.49 E:0.072177 |  yes they are and here's Hutchinson now the shaven-headed Hutchinson 39 years old to highlight
[778.26 - 783.22] P:1917.22 E:0.089558 |  on the left deep cross to the back post Buchanan nods it across it's come out David pulls it
[783.22 - 786.74] P:1819.18 E:0.091827 |  under his left foot shoots but that's blocked and Belgium should get it away but it's been
[786.74 - 790.94] P:1663.67 E:0.104483 |  given away and now David with another chance there might be another penalty in there you know
[791.26 - 797.82] P:1819.45 E:0.077795 |  although the offside flag is up and and the Canadian players I think are going to the referee
[797.82 - 802.70] P:1656.17 E:0.084041 |  and saying how about that for another penalty but I think the flag had already gone up before the
[802.70 - 808.14] P:1832.41 E:0.074803 |  challenge came in on Jonathan David yes it had and it would have been it would for Tongan took
[808.14 - 812.86] P:1828.58 E:0.090334 |  the legs of Jonathan David but he'd already received the ball in an offside position. We're
[812.86 - 817.74] P:1671.95 E:0.087413 |  looking at the replays here on our screens that would have definitely been a penalty if the offside
[817.74 - 823.26] P:1719.30 E:0.080553 |  flag hadn't been raised there was a a moment there when oh I think it was Jonathan David swung
[823.26 - 827.82] P:1862.34 E:0.084030 |  with his left foot he was about 12 yards out it was going goal woods when he struck it but if it
[827.82 - 833.58] P:1704.94 E:0.078243 |  had just laid it to his left Hutchinson was there on the penalty spot three strike at goal there the
[833.58 - 837.66] P:1880.91 E:0.074047 |  decisions you have to make the correct decisions if you're going to give yourself a chance to score
[837.66 - 842.30] P:1630.23 E:0.073745 |  a goal against a team like these. Belgium Nailed Canada Nailed that's Dion Dublin with us of course

[896.54 - 902.14] P:1734.36 E:0.064243 |  Canada Nailed and Belgium half-creeked that was quite a creaky piece of defending actually by
[902.14 - 909.34] P:1656.15 E:0.078647 |  Fertongan who is now 35 years old there's some there's some elderly elderly some older gentlemen
[909.34 - 916.06] P:1640.27 E:0.086041 |  out there on the pitch this evening aren't there Fertongan at 35 and Vohjan the goalkeeper 35 but
[916.06 - 923.10] P:1759.20 E:0.089773 |  no one's older than Atiba Hutchinson 39 years old who sets a record tonight as the second oldest
[923.10 - 928.70] P:1709.35 E:0.089891 |  outfield player at a World Cup the only outfield player older than Atiba Hutchinson is the famous

[935.58 - 941.18] P:1842.44 E:0.092371 |  junior Hoylert who chested across the penalty area David is in the middle Hoylert is bright shoots
[941.18 - 947.26] P:1776.05 E:0.085423 |  across goal but wider the far post from the far side of the penalty area a low shot skidded across
[947.26 - 951.98] P:1638.33 E:0.097314 |  the turf and beyond the far post you know it's a really good ball you know a really really good
[952.06 - 958.30] P:1876.66 E:0.080753 |  it's just fed into that left hand channel down Belgium's left down Canada's right it's fed from
[958.30 - 964.70] P:1764.75 E:0.083821 |  there in towards junior Hoylert he gets in between Fertongan who was I don't know who it was at the
[964.70 - 969.34] P:1791.30 E:0.087429 |  back there at the time but he gets in between Fertongan and out of their old and it's so easy
[969.34 - 973.82] P:1756.87 E:0.081872 |  one ball just cuts out three defenders they're just not switched on at the moment Belgium
[974.46 - 981.18] P:1746.72 E:0.073855 |  they're not Belgium Nail Canada Nail and we heard from our friend Christoph Terreur part of the
[981.26 - 986.06] P:1801.53 E:0.092151 |  five live Euroleague show before the before the match he was telling me he says the problem is
[986.06 - 992.14] P:1727.53 E:0.074527 |  Belgium haven't played well for a year together it's real concerns over this brilliant record for
[992.14 - 997.74] P:1664.99 E:0.090363 |  such a long time under Roberto Martinez world rank number one for such a long time but they lost that
[997.74 - 1002.94] P:1806.37 E:0.087050 |  position to Brazil earlier this year but now here they are coming forward but we've seen nothing of
[1002.94 - 1006.94] P:1508.40 E:0.084990 |  them in an attacking sense and I don't think I've said Kevin De Bruyne's name yet since the start of
[1006.94 - 1010.70] P:1659.06 E:0.083131 |  the match no I don't think he's had many touches he's trying to get on the ball but he's kind of
[1010.70 - 1015.74] P:1424.66 E:0.065756 |  being man marked in the middle of the park one in front one behind every every time he a Belgian
[1015.74 - 1019.90] P:1629.91 E:0.074791 |  player looks up to try and find him he'll find he'll find his feet he'll find the pace in the game
[1019.90 - 1025.10] P:1646.03 E:0.081837 |  he usually does Azard is fouled center field Alistair Johnston put in the challenge
[1025.90 - 1030.70] P:1687.25 E:0.088287 |  booze from the Canadian supporters but it's a pre-kicked to Belgium five or six yards inside
[1030.70 - 1034.78] P:1610.77 E:0.068383 |  the Canadian half and they're in they're in Canadians half I don't know how many times
[1034.78 - 1038.78] P:1547.31 E:0.081158 |  they've been in this half not many we've seen all the action in Belgium's final furs because
[1038.78 - 1044.30] P:1779.25 E:0.057551 |  Canada have been so good in this opening a few minutes so a free kick to Belgium yes they
[1044.30 - 1050.38] P:1777.06 E:0.073602 |  lost to Egypt in Q8 in their final warm-up match last week as we were hearing earlier so that means
[1050.38 - 1058.62] P:1706.02 E:0.072774 |  they've now lost six of their last 17 internationals Belgium most unlike them having lost only four of
[1058.62 - 1064.46] P:1620.54 E:0.080765 |  the first 60 under Roberto Martinez's management ball in from the right-hand side from Telemans
[1065.26 - 1070.06] P:1523.35 E:0.075661 |  of course this team is absolutely littered with players who either play or have played in the
[1070.06 - 1078.14] P:1617.79 E:0.062333 |  Premier League eight of this starting lineup that applies to and we have six of this Belgium team
[1078.14 - 1083.50] P:1753.36 E:0.076237 |  that are playing at their fifth tournament either World Cup or European Championships a great great
[1083.50 - 1091.42] P:1767.64 E:0.067103 |  experience as the ball goes back to Courtois Tibaut Courtois he's got 98 caps now should make it to
[1091.42 - 1096.22] P:1662.85 E:0.095223 |  100 all being well at the tournament and now here is Kevin de Bruyne for the first time receiving
[1096.22 - 1100.14] P:1702.34 E:0.096030 |  the ball in the centre circle and carrying it forward but over hitting the pass through for
[1100.14 - 1105.74] P:1780.13 E:0.086381 |  Carasco and goalkeeper Boyan can take three or four big steps forward and just picks the ball up
[1105.74 - 1111.42] P:1764.39 E:0.086850 |  as if it was a back pass from Kevin de Bruyne yeah he was striding past the age in Hutchinson he
[1111.42 - 1116.70] P:1789.56 E:0.082675 |  left him for dead for pace he was going straight towards the middle of the D and he picked the
[1116.70 - 1122.62] P:1927.35 E:0.092180 |  wrong pass Telemans was flying down his right shoulder he just didn't lift his head Kevin de Bruyne
[1122.62 - 1130.06] P:1689.55 E:0.070499 |  I can't believe I'm saying it but he made the wrong choice Belgium nil Canada nil five live
[1130.06 - 1136.14] P:1645.85 E:0.066470 |  and BBC sounds for this fourth match of the day first time I've covered one of what is here in
[1136.14 - 1141.74] P:1731.82 E:0.066091 |  Qatar one of the 10 o'clock kickoffs so it's going to be a late finish tonight by the time we get
[1141.74 - 1148.94] P:1762.06 E:0.085706 |  back onto the road into Doha and visit the petrol station as well which we have to do on the way back
[1148.94 - 1153.02] P:1605.52 E:0.101142 |  Yes we do yes I know the way out the stadium I've been here before don't worry about it
[1154.06 - 1159.90] P:1765.61 E:0.082409 |  The ball on the right hand side with Belgium inside their own half Castania have left the
[1159.90 - 1165.82] P:1730.20 E:0.080082 |  city of course up towards Batuay and then Whitzel chests the ball down and gives it on the halfway
[1165.82 - 1171.50] P:1722.44 E:0.084210 |  line to the captain Aidan Azad who crouches low and chests it down and then sets off on one of his
[1171.50 - 1178.22] P:1687.56 E:0.079622 |  weaving runs and is upended by Buchanan so it's a free kick again to Belgium near the centre circle
[1178.22 - 1183.74] P:1524.67 E:0.092054 |  Yeah I think when you watch Aidan Hazad play if you ever watch him play and he plays the ball
[1183.74 - 1189.26] P:1877.25 E:0.072916 |  forward and follows that ball forward in any of the thirds of it you can always sense that
[1189.26 - 1193.50] P:1739.49 E:0.088213 |  something's going to happen when he plays and stays then you know he's just controlling the game
[1193.50 - 1198.06] P:1703.05 E:0.073216 |  when he plays and goes forward he's making something happen there and then
[1198.06 - 1205.66] P:1658.06 E:0.072457 |  yeah one of the best players at the World Cup four years ago got the silver ball as the runner-up
[1205.66 - 1214.86] P:1741.42 E:0.080247 |  in the player of the tournament competition to Luka Modric this tonight for Azad his 124th appearance
[1214.86 - 1221.18] P:1708.28 E:0.077938 |  for Belgium and of course the issue with him has been his fitness at Real Madrid just played six
[1221.18 - 1227.50] P:1741.80 E:0.087492 |  times for Real Madrid this season so far but fit to captain and start at the first match of the World
[1227.58 - 1231.74] P:1554.66 E:0.088831 |  Cup for Belgium tonight where it is nil nil but Canada have been the better team at least in an
[1231.74 - 1236.14] P:1735.25 E:0.087915 |  attacking sense they've really caused problems for Belgium and the main news so far the fact that
[1236.14 - 1241.10] P:1721.56 E:0.083164 |  they had a chance to score their first goal at a World Cup but Alfonso Davis's penalty poor penalty
[1241.10 - 1247.10] P:1661.67 E:0.093680 |  Dion was saved by Couretois yeah it wasn't it wasn't a great save but it's the same he expects to make
[1247.10 - 1252.54] P:1695.09 E:0.087230 |  himself and it's just all the energy that they have and they're using it well at the moment they are
[1252.54 - 1257.50] P:1756.90 E:0.075035 |  the press is good whenever the the full backs get it and Belgium the press is there in three and
[1257.50 - 1262.70] P:1675.43 E:0.085233 |  four players they're not going on their own no space for Belgium to play through the lines at all
[1262.70 - 1269.74] P:1756.08 E:0.051466 |  they're looking frustrated at the moment Belgium nil nil 20 minutes played already so penalty save
[1269.74 - 1275.66] P:1640.15 E:0.077691 |  second night running I've seen a penalty saved after a chore kept out Robert Lewandowski last night
[1276.38 - 1283.02] P:1510.44 E:0.077066 |  tonight Couretois makes the save one of the very best goalkeepers as you will no doubt be aware
[1283.02 - 1288.30] P:1586.90 E:0.093528 |  Telemans is now tripped in the central third Roberto Martin has steps forward to right to the
[1288.30 - 1294.46] P:1717.34 E:0.077323 |  white line on the edge of the pitch and feeling that the referee I think the point is is that
[1294.46 - 1298.94] P:1598.81 E:0.083352 |  there've been a number of little fouls on Belgian players in the central third of the field and that's
[1298.94 - 1303.42] P:1607.76 E:0.079219 |  the latest of them Whitzel plays the ball back to the middleman of the three central defenders
[1303.42 - 1309.66] P:1753.34 E:0.071296 |  Toby Aldervireld who turns and gives it out to the left hand side and then it's back to Fautonghen
[1309.66 - 1317.10] P:1607.66 E:0.066063 |  now who is back with Anderlecht now Toby Aldervireld to his right now playing for Royal Antwerp
[1317.10 - 1321.74] P:1669.05 E:0.082149 |  back in his home country and then from the back Kamal Miller for Canada over hits that pass he
[1321.74 - 1326.70] P:1809.29 E:0.079788 |  was looking for Buchanan so Belgium now move forward with it again Carrasco with the bleached
[1326.70 - 1333.74] P:1737.77 E:0.079485 |  hair is being impeded he's being tugged by Laria so it's a free kick to Belgium inside their own
[1333.74 - 1340.22] P:1667.85 E:0.062548 |  half but quite well organised Canada looks like everyone knows the job that they're supposed to do
[1341.26 - 1349.90] P:1780.60 E:0.049662 |  and Belgium begin to come forward again here's Leander Dendonka of Aston Villa turns and gives
[1349.90 - 1356.14] P:1664.01 E:0.079664 |  it back to Toby Aldervireld and then a long long right footed pass from Aldervireld looking for
[1356.30 - 1361.02] P:1731.33 E:0.103116 |  it and Azad who takes that down brilliantly and gets away from Johnston and Azad back to the edge
[1361.02 - 1367.34] P:1892.24 E:0.097560 |  of the area to Telemans and Telemans across the bat away right side of the area. Puts the shot
[1367.34 - 1372.46] P:1868.52 E:0.099364 |  over the top of the crossbar he was slipping he was stretching for it Kamal Miller the central
[1372.46 - 1378.46] P:1790.40 E:0.089439 |  defender slid in as well and he actually deflected it up and over the top for what is a corner.
[1379.10 - 1384.70] P:1635.57 E:0.102299 |  Yeah Telemans actually lays it into Batshuay Telemans is on the edge of the on the edge of the box he
[1384.70 - 1389.98] P:1659.44 E:0.090294 |  lays it to his right Batshuay is there and Batshuay takes a touch doesn't need to take a touch it's
[1389.98 - 1395.42] P:1782.94 E:0.090228 |  a side foot it's on the angle about two yards away from the corner of the six yard box if he just
[1395.42 - 1400.22] P:1701.94 E:0.091363 |  if he backs himself with a nice strong ankle I think he's got a chance of scoring there he takes a
[1400.22 - 1408.78] P:1821.28 E:0.070900 |  touch and the defender nips him. Well defended by Miller Kamal Miller so it's a corner Belgium's
[1408.78 - 1414.38] P:1815.58 E:0.081434 |  first corner still 0-0 De Bruyne had to take this from way down in front of us out swinger
[1414.38 - 1421.42] P:1784.02 E:0.094369 |  towards the penalty spot but that is headed away by Steven Vittoria and now Canada looked to break
[1421.42 - 1425.74] P:1672.00 E:0.086276 |  through Davis but there was an important tackle in the middle of air in the middle of that and then
[1425.74 - 1430.62] P:1752.69 E:0.083211 |  a long pass forward that Kuatua is going to deal with out he clears it but he gives it away but
[1430.62 - 1439.10] P:1788.23 E:0.075435 |  Whitzel was able to to head forward the deflection in center field and junior Hoylert is able to in
[1439.10 - 1443.50] P:1596.87 E:0.082502 |  fact under pressure he puts it out of play for a throw on the halfway line John Herdman down there
[1443.50 - 1448.38] P:1814.68 E:0.074933 |  just fields the ball and gives it back for the throw to be taken. John Herdman tonight another
[1448.38 - 1453.98] P:1845.48 E:0.071296 |  sort of historical line John Herdman tonight becomes the first person to manage at both the
[1453.98 - 1462.22] P:1716.02 E:0.067758 |  men's and the women's world cup what an achievement that is he will always be able to say that this
[1462.22 - 1469.98] P:1829.00 E:0.092283 |  man from County Durham mad king fan of Newcastle United and now then Doncat passing it away from
[1469.98 - 1476.06] P:1782.43 E:0.099185 |  the back Tealamans that's a lovely pass and Bobrna has the run of the pitch he's got so much space
[1476.06 - 1480.62] P:1800.94 E:0.100336 |  and now he gives it to the edge of the area to Azad and Azad under pressure into the penalty area
[1480.62 - 1486.22] P:1788.98 E:0.090975 |  he's forced very wide it was Laria coming back and putting the challenge in on him it was quite
[1486.22 - 1491.58] P:1771.99 E:0.105034 |  forceful on the edge of the area but Azad stayed on his feet yeah he did Laria did really well there
[1491.58 - 1497.26] P:1791.04 E:0.074110 |  and Johnston shepherded hazard didn't allow him to get his head up to cross the ball or do any little
[1497.26 - 1502.94] P:1699.31 E:0.065507 |  bits of skill and they forced him back towards his teammate took a deflection and that was the
[1503.82 - 1508.14] P:1567.57 E:0.074993 |  the best thing that could have happened Belgium Nill Canada Nill I don't think there's quite as
[1508.14 - 1511.82] P:1586.35 E:0.093051 |  big an attendance inside the stadium tonight as there was for the Wales match when you were here
[1511.82 - 1517.26] P:1575.34 E:0.089508 |  the other night as Belgium win a free kick in center field quite a lot of empty red seats around
[1517.26 - 1524.46] P:1713.55 E:0.076642 |  the place and I noticed as well just been shown that um the FIFA have put out an updated an updated
[1524.54 - 1530.62] P:1583.06 E:0.079489 |  stadium capacity list so goodness knows how that how that's happened long pass from center field
[1531.18 - 1536.62] P:1798.77 E:0.080435 |  but Castaña making a burst into the box there was a defender in front of him and it hit him the
[1536.62 - 1541.66] P:1712.12 E:0.084698 |  long pass from center field from Aldervireld and bounced through for a goal kick so this stadium
[1541.66 - 1551.90] P:1732.06 E:0.072688 |  Ahmad bin Ali which was originally slated as being 40 000 capacity is now 45 000 and 32
[1553.66 - 1559.34] P:1523.70 E:0.069821 |  and and all of the stadiums have got different attendances well have a closer look at that later
[1559.34 - 1565.74] P:1659.18 E:0.059064 |  is that on the BBC sport website is it no FIFA have put it out so you'll find it there fascinating
[1566.54 - 1574.78] P:1712.01 E:0.079499 |  Belgium Nill Canada Nill and Alfonso Davis on the left hand side an elaborate step over but
[1574.78 - 1579.90] P:1761.46 E:0.104337 |  it's taken him up towards the edge of the area and he gets the ball back and Davis plays it square
[1579.90 - 1585.90] P:1766.11 E:0.085118 |  but then the uh a rather slashing shot from the veteran Hutchinson the captain on the edge of
[1585.90 - 1590.70] P:1691.51 E:0.097682 |  the area that lack conviction and it was wide by three or four yards yeah you can see Davis there
[1590.70 - 1594.86] P:1435.06 E:0.098290 |  he's receiving it on the right on the left hand side he wants to stay on his left foot but the
[1594.86 - 1600.22] P:1611.17 E:0.088429 |  Belgian players aren't allowing him to do that so shifted it to his uh to his older teammate and he
[1600.22 - 1605.66] P:1605.08 E:0.073100 |  slashed it over but brilliant skill though to get past to to the Belgian players I think uh you know
[1605.66 - 1609.74] P:1726.98 E:0.081045 |  they've already missed the great opportunity tonight from the penalties bot to score their first
[1609.74 - 1615.90] P:1663.55 E:0.076921 |  World Cup goal but were it to be a Tiber Hutchinson to score it winning his 97th cap tonight you know
[1615.90 - 1622.30] P:1774.21 E:0.082901 |  this this wildly and hugely popular footballer wherever he's gone in the world if he'd scored
[1622.30 - 1627.50] P:1693.63 E:0.083174 |  that from the edge of the D for Canada's first goal at a World Cup I mean that would be fairytale
[1627.50 - 1633.18] P:1645.50 E:0.083447 |  stuff however maybe maybe thought about the moment as he was arriving on the ball and he hit it wildly
[1633.18 - 1638.94] P:1714.71 E:0.093169 |  wide and now Witzholz been fouled that is another foul by the uh the midfielder Ustacul
[1639.90 - 1645.58] P:1719.46 E:0.091972 |  of Porto and again Roberto Martinez is pointing to various points on the field as if to say how
[1645.58 - 1649.26] P:1450.22 E:0.093305 |  many how many fouls are going to be allowed on my players before there's a yellow card
[1649.26 - 1654.14] P:1554.13 E:0.077737 |  happy is he no it's not uh good physical contact though they don't mind that these Canadian players
[1654.14 - 1659.10] P:1577.10 E:0.076961 |  are really getting close to the Belgian midfield players not allowing Witzholz and De Bruyne to
[1659.10 - 1663.26] P:1425.03 E:0.077402 |  lift their heads not having their own way at the moment the other point about Hutchinson Dion is
[1663.26 - 1669.18] P:1600.77 E:0.069579 |  he's been able to play only one match this season because he had a bruised bone so he's just played
[1669.18 - 1675.82] P:1644.78 E:0.079059 |  one competitive match this season so you know you can understand him perhaps not looking absolutely
[1675.82 - 1683.98] P:1739.84 E:0.082973 |  tip top as Canada win the ball back deep inside their own half and it is Ustacul who is challenged
[1683.98 - 1693.26] P:1698.65 E:0.071561 |  by Witzholz and now Davis Davis being forced back by Keylemens and doesn't like the challenge
[1693.26 - 1697.82] P:1769.70 E:0.082193 |  actually looks over his shoulder at Keylemens for for the force of the challenge that he put in on him
[1697.82 - 1702.78] P:1627.00 E:0.082757 |  but back through the goalkeeper Boyan the ball is played out towards the right hand side now in the
[1702.86 - 1707.34] P:1698.28 E:0.096984 |  middle of the field Jonathan David's come rather deep Harry Kane style but passes the ball down the
[1707.34 - 1711.50] P:1713.87 E:0.100351 |  right hand side to Lariat and Buchanan's in the middle and Lariat takes it on into the box and
[1711.50 - 1717.10] P:1779.37 E:0.084762 |  pulls it back but Castania came across from the right wing back position and was there to prevent
[1717.10 - 1722.30] P:1691.98 E:0.082644 |  it from reaching junior Hoylert in the middle and Belgium Cleart still goalless five live in BBC
[1722.30 - 1727.42] P:1702.80 E:0.093501 |  sounds live here at the World Cup in Qatar and Canada coming forward again and Witzholz just
[1727.98 - 1732.54] P:1742.28 E:0.096716 |  putting the tackle in but the ball still live Lariat tries to play it across the penalty area
[1732.54 - 1738.30] P:1740.68 E:0.078630 |  that's blocked by the defender for Tongan and Belgium get it away down there panic panic from
[1738.30 - 1742.94] P:1660.17 E:0.080190 |  those five at the back they're going into a five at the back when they haven't got the ball now
[1742.94 - 1746.70] P:1716.87 E:0.100040 |  Belgium they're they're worried about the movement they're worried about going down the side with
[1746.70 - 1750.86] P:1673.32 E:0.080495 |  pace they're worried about Hoylert coming in from the left hand side and getting across the center
[1750.86 - 1756.14] P:1649.14 E:0.081174 |  halves the Tongan out of their own the gaps between them are massive so they're loving that as well
[1756.14 - 1759.58] P:1728.29 E:0.100995 |  the Canadian players and now he has Johnston bringing the ball forward from the right back
[1759.58 - 1764.54] P:1853.03 E:0.097245 |  position for Canada and he's still going to the edge of the area oh and he's surely fouled he's
[1764.54 - 1768.62] P:1824.50 E:0.105596 |  surely brought down on the edge of the penalty area no the referee arms play to continue then
[1768.62 - 1773.18] P:1808.23 E:0.098817 |  Johnston gets up and shoots and it's saved by Courtois Johnston again heads it across the
[1773.18 - 1778.14] P:1690.70 E:0.088458 |  penalty area and Belgium are able to get it away but that looked to me as though Dendonka
[1778.14 - 1784.06] P:1724.91 E:0.084586 |  caught him in the box I thought he took his legs just on the edge of the box well it looked like
[1784.06 - 1789.10] P:1790.51 E:0.099418 |  that to me referee didn't even didn't even look at it and the players haven't haven't made a great
[1789.10 - 1795.34] P:1850.81 E:0.088142 |  deal of it so well watch that again out of interest with interest when it when it appears
[1796.30 - 1803.58] P:1782.62 E:0.075607 |  play still continuing the staccio plays it up towards the the lively figure of Buchanan
[1803.58 - 1808.78] P:1708.86 E:0.092399 |  and Buchanan is running at Alderv-Ireld and now he's trying to find a way into the penalty
[1808.78 - 1813.50] P:1646.88 E:0.081888 |  area past Castania but just overheated and for Tongan was able to come across and put it out of
[1813.50 - 1819.74] P:1691.86 E:0.087352 |  play on the half course and Havoc absolutely causing havoc at the moment yes they are just
[1819.74 - 1825.26] P:1706.24 E:0.090206 |  through just through energy and and getting in behind the ball and not allowing Belgium any time
[1825.26 - 1829.90] P:1606.41 E:0.082025 |  I mean Buchanan up top and David and Hoylert they're just there's three up there and they're just
[1829.90 - 1838.54] P:1708.09 E:0.056956 |  sort of rotating it's working well at the moment for them looking really well and uh I know a little
[1838.54 - 1842.70] P:1772.63 E:0.096476 |  television here in the commentary position they've shown us a replay of the Johnston shot but they've
[1842.70 - 1850.38] P:1831.62 E:0.085401 |  not shown a replay of the Dendonka challenge on Johnston so it's gone and uh the staccio playing
[1850.38 - 1855.58] P:1875.12 E:0.103370 |  the ball forward and Canada coming forward again dangerously Buchanan back to David David shot
[1855.58 - 1862.46] P:1812.61 E:0.085378 |  is blocked by the defender Alderv-Ireld threw himself in the way of it and took all the pace of it
[1862.46 - 1869.10] P:1820.80 E:0.076642 |  off it and Kutwa was able to catch decision making in the final third for Canada that's all it is
[1869.10 - 1873.74] P:1740.82 E:0.076863 |  they're just I think what's happening they're getting into gold scoring situations but there's
[1873.74 - 1878.06] P:1733.88 E:0.090716 |  a better gold scoring situation and they can't see it there's other players that are flying down the
[1878.06 - 1884.14] P:1837.35 E:0.088029 |  left flying down the right and they're just choosing the wrong option they've had three or four good
[1884.14 - 1891.74] P:1826.29 E:0.082714 |  chances to test Kutwa and they haven't done it you can't keep letting these chances pass you by
[1892.38 - 1899.58] P:1750.90 E:0.077632 |  the score is Belgium 0 Canada 0 and Dion Dublin I think we've seen enough football we know what's
[1899.58 - 1905.74] P:1806.48 E:0.071743 |  going to happen here don't we looking that way they are going to pay dearly for not taking those
[1905.74 - 1911.42] P:1707.47 E:0.101252 |  chances and here's Batuay on the edge of the area but Miller is able to win it from him for Canada
[1911.42 - 1917.50] P:1685.50 E:0.098297 |  and now Hutchinson chips it to the left hand side and Davis now slipped by Tealamon so Davis is away
[1917.58 - 1923.02] P:1751.69 E:0.096329 |  he's left him on the ground Davis and plays it in field Hoylert is battling through it with Azard
[1923.02 - 1928.30] P:1810.87 E:0.097801 |  and they went shoulder to shoulder and Hoylert has come out with it and Hoylert now chips across to
[1928.30 - 1933.82] P:1776.60 E:0.097492 |  the back post and did it off balance can only head it up in the air and wide of the far post but
[1933.82 - 1939.98] P:1798.97 E:0.108321 |  again really really good from Canada yet not just not just the nice football the play not just the
[1939.98 - 1947.10] P:1738.37 E:0.100302 |  chances but the commitment and the mindset and their shape is very very good every time the physical
[1947.10 - 1952.70] P:1761.77 E:0.090668 |  battles there the two number tens Hoylert and Hazard going shoulder to shoulder knocking Hazard
[1952.70 - 1958.70] P:1734.88 E:0.089516 |  over once in the Bournemore here's Debrona though receives it from Batuay Debrona now on the left
[1958.70 - 1963.34] P:1858.85 E:0.100122 |  wing currently goes for a high crossfield pass Batuay is underneath this should go it's been
[1963.34 - 1975.02] P:1856.54 E:0.066764 |  it's deflected off Miller and the goalkeeper caught it the assistant has flagged three flags for
[1975.02 - 1984.14] P:1804.73 E:0.064882 |  goal kick anyway Batuay is being helped to his feet and it is indeed given as a goal kick
[1984.14 - 1989.02] P:1477.00 E:0.097797 |  yes it's it's exactly what you were saying John it's we know what's going to happen here and
[1989.02 - 1994.30] P:1653.30 E:0.083583 |  Kevin Debrona gets free a bit of time to pick a pass he picks the collect pass Batuay pulling
[1994.30 - 1998.38] P:1728.28 E:0.084548 |  away from the defender doesn't quite catch it but doesn't matter how good you're playing doesn't
[1998.38 - 2003.50] P:1595.76 E:0.088004 |  matter how well organized you are if you don't use this time to score a goal you are very very
[2003.50 - 2008.30] P:1490.76 E:0.089042 |  vulnerable yeah mark my words everyone I'm gonna put my neck on the line go on then after last
[2008.30 - 2012.70] P:1684.68 E:0.089108 |  night boldly predicting early on in the game that Robert Levendowski would score his first goal at
[2012.70 - 2020.22] P:1645.55 E:0.090518 |  the World Cup and sitting there with the microphone having that go for you licking my lips as he stood
[2020.22 - 2024.22] P:1494.74 E:0.096200 |  over that penalty thinking here we are I'm going to be proved right you weren't feeling smug
[2024.22 - 2031.18] P:1565.95 E:0.091246 |  where you are of course but I'm gonna I'm not gonna learn from my mistake you're gonna get on
[2031.18 - 2036.46] P:1529.72 E:0.066401 |  you're gonna get on you're gonna get on I'm gonna say tonight Belgium are going to make Canada pay
[2036.46 - 2042.38] P:1556.98 E:0.073502 |  for these missed chances yeah I can't I can't disagree with that I'm afraid however yes we might
[2042.38 - 2050.14] P:1713.74 E:0.075806 |  be wrong so don't go anywhere everyone Belgium nil Canada nil this match also on BBC one so you
[2050.14 - 2056.62] P:1715.96 E:0.088324 |  might want to go and watch it but I have to say you can listen to us and watch it here's Castania
[2056.62 - 2061.50] P:1744.96 E:0.090773 |  down the right hand side you won't reach that and pulls it back but the ball was already over the
[2061.50 - 2070.54] P:1792.86 E:0.069278 |  line and it is a goal kick so Belgium will drop back into position but it's been an unconvincing
[2070.54 - 2076.54] P:1600.18 E:0.086543 |  display from from Belgium so far I mean and and also the other point is when Belgium come forward
[2077.18 - 2083.34] P:1672.20 E:0.095079 |  Canada are leaving them so much space yeah they are it's because Belgium they haven't had the bubble
[2083.34 - 2089.34] P:1723.15 E:0.085859 |  when they do beat that press when they do beat the energy then you do have the brouhna running at
[2089.34 - 2094.54] P:1699.02 E:0.089366 |  your defence and bits and hazard with the ball and then they're starting to spin back towards their
[2094.54 - 2100.46] P:1774.60 E:0.083453 |  own goal it's lush defense it's they've gone away with it at the moment like I've said while you have
[2101.98 - 2107.02] P:1625.16 E:0.086088 |  your team in the ascendancy you have to get yourself on the score sheet Belgium nil Canada nil
[2107.74 - 2113.66] P:1705.39 E:0.070552 |  every few moments the attention is drawn to the lights that flash on the top of the stadium
[2113.66 - 2118.54] P:1618.82 E:0.083544 |  there's like a big metal frame around the roof of the stadium here and you can see it from miles
[2118.54 - 2124.14] P:1703.29 E:0.083372 |  around and the stadiums lit up colourfully as well for a night match but those lights flash on and off
[2124.14 - 2129.58] P:1741.90 E:0.078287 |  all of the time feels like driving out here almost on the fringes of the city of Doha
[2130.30 - 2136.86] P:1775.56 E:0.069518 |  and it's just the the desert beyond Belgium lose possession Canada have it back inside their own
[2136.86 - 2142.86] P:1688.89 E:0.075062 |  half uh Christophe Theroux was also telling me that that Belgium are based on the other coast
[2142.86 - 2148.54] P:1793.40 E:0.080799 |  of Qatar so we're here on the east coast they're over on the west coast so they're actually about
[2148.54 - 2155.34] P:1713.04 E:0.078508 |  an hour and a half's drive away from Doha right across the middle of the country rather than staying
[2155.34 - 2163.18] P:1674.19 E:0.066305 |  here in the uh in the big city here's Davis he says it's very nice over there as well Davis
[2163.18 - 2167.66] P:1650.01 E:0.096047 |  playing the ball to the right hand side to Johnston and Johnston now is able to bring it forward
[2167.66 - 2172.62] P:1677.28 E:0.064539 |  and goes for an early ball into the middle but that's headed away by Alderweirald and Belgium
[2172.62 - 2177.18] P:1670.12 E:0.086907 |  should be able to clear they do up to Azad but Azad runs into Hutchinson and Hutchinson passes it
[2177.18 - 2182.06] P:1662.72 E:0.073015 |  forward to the right hand side to to larry at and then it bounces away off Whitzel out towards the
[2182.06 - 2187.42] P:1700.66 E:0.066544 |  far side where it is kept in by Carrasco and then Carrasco back to Whitzel and Belgium have
[2187.42 - 2192.22] P:1719.60 E:0.078159 |  got it halfway inside their own half we've got less than 10 minutes to go it's a half time
[2192.78 - 2198.46] P:1506.09 E:0.072768 |  I think that's right yes it is my stopwatch was misbehaving last night I was blaming on the desert
[2198.46 - 2203.42] P:1696.38 E:0.074168 |  heat although it's very pleasant in here tonight isn't it it's his cast nice temperature isn't it
[2203.42 - 2209.82] P:1564.12 E:0.067946 |  lovely temperature helped by the air conditioning no doubt I'm not thinking that I'm sure the vest
[2209.82 - 2215.02] P:1691.00 E:0.076283 |  isn't working for you tonight I don't know I'm afraid yes it's I think you I think you're mixing
[2215.02 - 2220.94] P:1742.53 E:0.088319 |  me we look up with Ian Dennis a lot a lot of people do you know the ball is up towards the
[2220.94 - 2229.10] P:1811.86 E:0.075929 |  halfway line which is flicked on and then the Vittoria passes it to Ostacchio been really bright
[2229.10 - 2237.58] P:1793.17 E:0.072028 |  really encouraging this this display this first world cup display for Canada since 1986 when they
[2237.58 - 2242.14] P:1607.88 E:0.095110 |  lost all three of their matches one nil to France two nil to Hungary two nil to the Soviet Union
[2242.78 - 2247.90] P:1582.82 E:0.074711 |  so lost all three without scoring a goal ball on the right hand side and it is the Canadians trying

[2534.14 - 2539.02] P:1590.77 E:0.063657 |  away on his left foot and Belgium have got it back inside their own half again mentioned about
[2539.02 - 2543.98] P:1717.80 E:0.079631 |  how people in Canada will have been feeling watching that penalty hearts and mouths and the
[2543.98 - 2549.90] P:1670.36 E:0.070885 |  disappointment when it was say poor penalty from Alfonso Davis but at the same time can you imagine
[2549.90 - 2555.18] P:1660.85 E:0.077388 |  the reaction there is in Belgium and they have been quite critical of the way that the Belgian

[2560.86 - 2565.10] P:1668.85 E:0.076329 |  tournament I mean if you let them back into this game now if you're allowed to have time in the
[2565.10 - 2571.26] P:1632.89 E:0.073665 |  ball and pick a pass they will find a way through one or two one or two times in this game yeah

[2580.70 - 2587.10] P:1700.28 E:0.067078 |  but it's sent forward and then Donca will return it to Tibo Couretois so in the last four either will
[2587.10 - 2592.78] P:1629.45 E:0.074822 |  cup a European championship tournaments they've gone quarter final quarter final semifinal quarter
[2592.78 - 2602.06] P:1693.74 E:0.058788 |  final not able to really capitalise on the great talent that they've had they've had and still have
[2604.94 - 2612.78] P:1676.39 E:0.068369 |  it is de Bruyne winning his 95th cap tonight four of the six men who've won 100 caps or more
[2613.34 - 2618.46] P:1598.17 E:0.077450 |  for Belgium are on the field in this match tonight four out of the six Centurions
[2619.66 - 2623.90] P:1686.99 E:0.108550 |  forward from Alderweil that's that long pass again looking for Carasco it's bounce from Batuay
[2624.62 - 2633.66] P:1929.58 E:0.100048 |  brilliant finish left foot bang one nil Belgium and Michy Batuay is dancing in the corner of the
[2633.66 - 2640.46] P:1922.50 E:0.091786 |  stadium here Belgium have made Canada pay they didn't take their chances
[2642.22 - 2649.18] P:1863.99 E:0.101348 |  and Batuay has Belgium won Canada nil just before halftime one of the simplest finishes he will
[2649.18 - 2655.10] P:1848.93 E:0.099005 |  ever come across Michy Batuay he puts it in the back of an in between two defenders Johnston
[2655.10 - 2662.62] P:1866.99 E:0.082520 |  Victoria switched off he gets in between them half volley straight ball straight passes about
[2662.70 - 2671.26] P:1726.65 E:0.083274 |  10 yards out little side foot pass the keeper meet and drink but that's why easy easy I did say
[2671.26 - 2677.10] P:1684.62 E:0.080975 |  if you don't take your chances you are in trouble came from that Alderviral pass yeah not the not
[2677.10 - 2681.34] P:1629.06 E:0.093157 |  the first time that that's caused problems for the Belgian backline for the Canadian backline
[2681.34 - 2686.30] P:1691.16 E:0.084763 |  clearly something that Roberto Martinez has identified and it's worked yeah and it was
[2686.30 - 2689.90] P:1581.39 E:0.090608 |  and at the time that ball was being played Kevin de Bruyne was talking to the manager
[2689.90 - 2695.02] P:1716.13 E:0.090981 |  he was chatting to his manager getting instruction Kevin de Bruyne wasn't in the island any of the
[2695.02 - 2698.54] P:1736.33 E:0.105244 |  Canadian players they must be thinking where is he back to why he's straight in straight ball
[2699.18 - 2705.34] P:1766.42 E:0.087612 |  very very good finish composed finish so no look at who he's on the uh on the injured list but
[2705.34 - 2714.14] P:1654.40 E:0.088106 |  Batuay's come in and Batman as he likes to style himself has scored his 27th goal for Belgium
[2714.70 - 2719.82] P:1623.55 E:0.080331 |  and they are in front Roberto Martinez his side Koutar saved the penalty early on in the match
[2719.82 - 2725.34] P:1647.91 E:0.084174 |  Batuay scores near half time five minutes of added time at the end of this first half that is like
[2725.34 - 2732.54] P:1662.03 E:0.076916 |  by the standards of this World Cup so another five minutes before the halftime whistle will be blown
[2734.70 - 2741.10] P:1606.96 E:0.070164 |  Batuay and the Belgium supporters inside the stadium will be feeling much better about themselves
[2742.06 - 2749.26] P:1725.06 E:0.081103 |  the television here has just shown a close-up of the those famous big goggily eyes of Pierre
[2749.26 - 2755.82] P:1606.98 E:0.090333 |  Luigi Collina who's in charge of the referees at FIFA and Belgium now looking for a second goal
[2755.82 - 2760.86] P:1720.22 E:0.093350 |  before halftime de Bruyne at the Azar who hits a pass through the middle along the grass but
[2760.86 - 2765.98] P:1772.10 E:0.072501 |  Boyan's able to come out and pick it up it's a really good finish by Batuay it wasn't up for the
[2765.98 - 2770.06] P:1548.96 E:0.092348 |  goal just allowed the ball to drop over his shoulder the defender was there yeah with him Miller came
[2770.06 - 2775.66] P:1641.56 E:0.071728 |  across but just as it bounced up he hit it and steered it with his left foot beyond and across
[2775.66 - 2781.66] P:1699.06 E:0.081757 |  the goalkeeper and into the net there's Canada come forward with Davis Davis then passes her into
[2781.66 - 2786.86] P:1727.95 E:0.089968 |  the area now a chance for David who pulls the ball across the six yard box but into the path
[2786.86 - 2790.78] P:1566.48 E:0.099566 |  of Fatongan who was able to clear it away and again story of the night for the miss me that
[2790.78 - 2794.22] P:1681.22 E:0.092018 |  nice story of the night for them getting into really good areas and then just choosing the wrong
[2794.22 - 2798.86] P:1734.88 E:0.084816 |  pass or the execution of that pass isn't there they're still getting white shirts into the box
[2799.50 - 2805.18] P:1787.24 E:0.084509 |  but there's just a feeling now that the more Belgium have the ball the more they'll take control
[2805.66 - 2815.10] P:1794.13 E:0.066485 |  the more they'll score 1-0 so Canada are still in it but you know Dion you'll have been in this
[2815.10 - 2819.42] P:1605.29 E:0.082155 |  position many many times as a professional when you've been involved in this sort of match and
[2819.42 - 2823.82] P:1663.35 E:0.102961 |  you get back into the dressing room and you're 1-0 down but here's Larry at Larry Arocos our
[2823.82 - 2829.74] P:1815.67 E:0.087689 |  chance in the middle for Buchanan on the left foot sliding in edge of the six yard box and he's
[2829.74 - 2833.82] P:1606.41 E:0.099837 |  lifted it over the top of the bar another big chance gone for Canada I think that's Larry
[2833.82 - 2838.86] P:1887.87 E:0.098170 |  who just puts it across it's a really good ball by the way it's two yards away from the six yard
[2838.86 - 2844.86] P:1675.13 E:0.066329 |  box he's put it over the bar I don't know how he's put it over the bar Buchanan will look back at
[2844.86 - 2849.90] P:1738.83 E:0.076909 |  this one and I'll say that's just a tapping it's what he's tried to do the balls come in with pace
[2849.90 - 2854.46] P:1792.64 E:0.080374 |  and then you just let it hit your foot he's tried to strike the ball he's striked it too hard and
[2854.46 - 2858.46] P:1698.40 E:0.084994 |  it's gone over the bar chance after chance they've had they've had the best chances tonight
[2858.86 - 2868.06] P:1870.22 E:0.068959 |  they've had 1-0 Belgium lead in this group where Morocco and Croatia drew 0-0 earlier
[2869.26 - 2876.06] P:1697.43 E:0.073623 |  and Belgium's next game is against Morocco the next matches in this group are in are on Sunday
[2877.10 - 2881.82] P:1750.95 E:0.087957 |  Canada still coming forward five minutes of added time we've had almost three of them so there's
[2881.82 - 2888.22] P:1656.45 E:0.077119 |  still time Davis is off and away from Gulsko Rabatua'i and then Davis rather runs into
[2889.42 - 2894.70] P:1749.98 E:0.088726 |  then Doncads no free kick for that De Bruyne I couldn't find the pass through to Azadi actually
[2894.70 - 2901.26] P:1650.80 E:0.071430 |  passed it straight into Vittoria so it is Canada again who have it dated to the right hand side
[2901.26 - 2905.50] P:1562.82 E:0.093904 |  Larry is there again Carrasco puts in the challenge that ball's going to run behind for a corner it
[2905.50 - 2910.86] P:1653.03 E:0.091133 |  is next to the flag over on the far side so it is a late corner in the first half for Canada
[2910.86 - 2915.66] P:1594.18 E:0.100129 |  yeah I think the way forward for Camerij is getting Davis further forward getting in the final third
[2915.74 - 2919.58] P:1793.86 E:0.081478 |  down that left hand side letting create Habak he wants to take players on
[2919.58 - 2923.58] P:1667.08 E:0.097539 |  but if he gets him wrong in that left back spot then he's in trouble get him up the pitch a bit more
[2925.26 - 2931.42] P:1816.64 E:0.087111 |  Davis is going to take the corner trots over there and receives the ball from in front of the
[2932.14 - 2938.62] P:1756.39 E:0.083148 |  ever-changing electronic sponsors hoardings and then steps away and Canada from the set piece
[2938.62 - 2942.78] P:1796.63 E:0.100111 |  just before halftime in comes the delivery over the top of Carrasco and then Estaccio with a shot
[2942.78 - 2946.78] P:1791.58 E:0.084912 |  on the edge of the area hits a defender and is cleared away I don't think they're shouting for
[2946.78 - 2952.30] P:1659.16 E:0.088643 |  a handball this time finds its way back to Davis on the right hand side Davis against Carrasco
[2952.30 - 2956.94] P:1795.87 E:0.091140 |  Davis beats him one way Carrasco though as he tried to beat him again managed to get the foot in
[2956.94 - 2961.90] P:1680.46 E:0.094493 |  took the ball away and actually Aidan Azad now carries it up towards the halfway line and then
[2961.90 - 2968.86] P:1806.23 E:0.083523 |  passes it over the line to De Bruyne and De Bruyne now in that way of his plays the ball across the
[2969.42 - 2975.82] P:1733.54 E:0.086129 |  the area behind Azad Canada get it away De Bruyne though is in there again and then Alistair Johnston
[2976.54 - 2981.98] P:1698.14 E:0.079381 |  is underneath it and volleys it to the halfway line it's got a very old-fashioned sound hasn't
[2981.98 - 2989.26] P:1622.54 E:0.076541 |  it for some reason Alistair Johnston the Canadian right back I don't think there are any other Alistair's

[3013.82 - 3019.50] P:1805.90 E:0.098322 |  oh yes and there is the halftime whistle well that's been eventful Belgium are winning 1-0 at
[3019.50 - 3026.78] P:1836.78 E:0.086492 |  halftime Batchewaey scoring in the 44th minute Canada should have scored their first World Cup goal

[3032.38 - 3037.18] P:1650.44 E:0.103907 |  I can feel his disappointment from here and the responsibility remember he's a young man 22 years
[3037.18 - 3042.70] P:1624.97 E:0.088011 |  old he took the responsibility and hit a poor penalty that Couretois saved but all of the other
[3042.70 - 3048.06] P:1648.14 E:0.074606 |  chances Canada have had they've come they've gone and Belgium are winning beyond Dublin
[3051.42 - 3056.46] P:1725.54 E:0.090514 |  Belgium to take charge of this game they haven't they haven't needed to to be fair because Canada
[3056.46 - 3062.14] P:1654.35 E:0.090621 |  have been wasteful in front of goal and that's the only negative I have on them to be honest with
[3062.14 - 3066.94] P:1571.28 E:0.089739 |  you they've been absolutely outstanding for 35 minutes in the first half very positive
[3066.94 - 3073.02] P:1698.85 E:0.087453 |  lots of energy final third need to do better Belgium just waited and waited and waited quality
[3073.02 - 3079.74] P:1642.52 E:0.081181 |  past quality finish but it is still alive it's not over yet halftime Belgium won Canada no
[3080.46 - 3083.98] P:1735.42 E:0.110090 |  it's been really entertaining though John and Dion that there've been some
[3084.54 - 3090.94] P:1747.88 E:0.091921 |  real moments for Canada they're way ahead in terms of shots on goal not necessarily shots on target
[3090.94 - 3096.38] P:1805.84 E:0.081038 |  but they've had 13 shots compared to Belgium's four and it just feels like that finesse that
[3096.38 - 3102.54] P:1791.04 E:0.078486 |  experience of being at major tournaments is just missing in that Belgium side in the Belgium side
[3102.54 - 3107.26] P:1670.93 E:0.097177 |  or the Canadian side sorry Canada side sorry Dion yeah yeah yeah no but no but you're right in
[3107.26 - 3112.54] P:1673.31 E:0.089480 |  everything you say there Kelly because they've done everything right they really have they've won the
[3112.54 - 3117.50] P:1732.94 E:0.084397 |  ball back with pace they've closed down the Belgium midfield players that can change a game
[3117.50 - 3122.86] P:1812.87 E:0.086283 |  with pace they haven't had a chance to do anything they've wanted to do for 35 minutes so they've
[3122.86 - 3127.42] P:1758.14 E:0.092979 |  done everything with pace and unfortunately they've tried to finish when they get into those positions
[3127.42 - 3132.62] P:1473.55 E:0.090753 |  with pace and there's no calm there's no ice cool number nine that's going to put the ball in the
[3132.62 - 3137.66] P:1512.00 E:0.089775 |  back of the net or haven't seen it as yet that's what they have to do get the ball back with pace
[3137.66 - 3143.66] P:1479.98 E:0.082127 |  and then calm down they haven't had that calm down moment yes Kelly you've for me she backed
[3143.66 - 3148.38] P:1584.72 E:0.098073 |  Schwaid to get the goal that's put Belgium up at halftime I mean John many people would have been
[3148.38 - 3155.66] P:1617.49 E:0.084418 |  questioning his inclusion in this starting 11 maybe so you know Lukaku is injured as I say he's got
[3155.66 - 3165.10] P:1610.60 E:0.078327 |  this this hamstring problem but but Batuayi has been quite a Roberto Martinez man hasn't he in the
[3165.26 - 3171.18] P:1798.52 E:0.094650 |  time that Roberto Martinez has been in charge and as I say you know he is in decent goal scoring form
[3171.18 - 3175.90] P:1847.56 E:0.092073 |  he's got he's got eight of them for for Fenerbahce this season which is where he's playing now scored

[3187.66 - 3194.54] P:1702.89 E:0.088772 |  goal well. Dion just looking at at Canada and from their perspective look they might not go on to
[3194.62 - 3198.38] P:1837.25 E:0.103350 |  win this game Belgium already have the advantage and they also have the experience playing
[3198.38 - 3204.06] P:1885.92 E:0.095177 |  in the second half but from what we've seen of Canada over these 45 minutes they could really
[3204.06 - 3209.42] P:1828.41 E:0.092935 |  be a lot of fun at this tournament yes they seem to be enjoying it as well you know in the first
[3209.42 - 3213.50] P:1860.14 E:0.098711 |  half an hour they really enjoyed their football they played some really good stuff they look confident

[3234.14 - 3238.78] P:1710.75 E:0.102483 |  I mean by that he hasn't gone back to defend he's found that little pocket and when they win it back
[3238.78 - 3243.82] P:1748.14 E:0.096638 |  he's the man that gets the ball he's the man that dictates the pace of Belgium's attacks and you
[3243.82 - 3248.14] P:1881.40 E:0.106988 |  know he's going to start taking charge of this game again Pat Nevin who's here with me in the

[3530.78 - 3532.78] P:1665.68 E:0.107267 |  Pat Nevin is alongside me,
[3532.78 - 3535.78] P:1939.90 E:0.102212 |  Julien Laurent joins us from the Akmaid-Binali stadium,
[3535.78 - 3539.78] P:1923.61 E:0.081554 |  having watched the first 45 minutes of Belgium's game against Canada,
[3539.78 - 3542.78] P:1704.25 E:0.095989 |  which they lead by a goal to nail.
[3542.78 - 3546.78] P:1803.85 E:0.091265 |  Earlier Germany suffered a drop to beat by Japan.
[3546.78 - 3550.78] P:1724.65 E:0.101678 |  Japan came from a goal down to beat the 4-time winners by 2 goals to 1.
[3550.78 - 3553.78] P:1826.32 E:0.098551 |  We will reflect on that very shortly.
[3553.78 - 3556.78] P:1729.64 E:0.097741 |  Just a quick word on that first half, Julien.
[3557.78 - 3559.78] P:1629.63 E:0.100361 |  I thought I loved this Canada team.
[3559.78 - 3563.78] P:1593.40 E:0.102699 |  I have to say, I had high expectations because they've been fantastic in the way they qualified.
[3563.78 - 3565.78] P:1937.57 E:0.100414 |  John Herdman, the English coach,
[3565.78 - 3569.78] P:1783.74 E:0.100938 |  I think he's doing a great job after doing a great job with the women's side,
[3569.78 - 3571.78] P:1936.46 E:0.096780 |  and even with the youth teams.
[3571.78 - 3574.78] P:1615.95 E:0.098964 |  Now with this team, the players that they have,
[3574.78 - 3576.78] P:1661.10 E:0.097190 |  I mean, Ustakio Porto-Mitfield,
[3576.78 - 3578.78] P:1697.89 E:0.101635 |  he's a superb player, he's only 25,
[3578.78 - 3581.78] P:1911.91 E:0.081886 |  and I'm sure soon he'll be in a much bigger club.
[3581.78 - 3583.78] P:1685.89 E:0.111564 |  Atiba Hershinson is 39 years old,
[3583.78 - 3585.78] P:1794.75 E:0.106668 |  he's the oldest player in this tournament,
[3585.78 - 3589.78] P:1805.20 E:0.097456 |  he's the only man in his squad who was born the last time Canada in 1986,
[3589.78 - 3591.78] P:1873.82 E:0.089881 |  when they were in the World Cup,
[3591.78 - 3593.78] P:1525.50 E:0.104698 |  and he's still bossing that Mitfield, he's bossing Witzel,
[3593.78 - 3595.78] P:1854.65 E:0.091774 |  he's bossing Tilleman's, and them too.
[3595.78 - 3597.78] P:1714.51 E:0.109562 |  I've run the game, but football can be cruel sometimes,
[3597.78 - 3600.78] P:1793.03 E:0.090892 |  and like the boys were saying, just one mistake on that long ball,
[3600.78 - 3602.78] P:1525.65 E:0.116482 |  that was not even for Batra,
[3602.78 - 3605.78] P:1850.40 E:0.093497 |  it was clearly aimed for Carrasco,
[3605.78 - 3607.78] P:1836.26 E:0.093404 |  and the penalty missed, and the chances that they had,
[3607.78 - 3609.78] P:1396.34 E:0.106752 |  there's a second half to play,
[3609.78 - 3611.78] P:1835.76 E:0.078374 |  but you wonder if that goal psychologically, I think,
[3611.78 - 3613.78] P:1655.47 E:0.078618 |  could be a bit of a blow for Canada.
[3613.78 - 3615.78] P:1766.63 E:0.105545 |  More to come from Chile and Laurent, and from Pat,
[3615.78 - 3618.78] P:1752.63 E:0.097455 |  more now though on Germany's Shock to Feet by Japan.
[3618.78 - 3621.78] P:1714.87 E:0.081720 |  Here's Ilke Gundurren at full time.
[3621.78 - 3623.78] P:1274.10 E:0.076807 |  We have no other choice, to be honest,
[3623.78 - 3625.78] P:1125.49 E:0.106785 |  than try to be confident, you know,
[3625.78 - 3628.78] P:1247.12 E:0.078595 |  and play on the best possible level,
[3628.78 - 3632.78] P:1167.37 E:0.074649 |  because unfortunately, because of the result today,
[3632.78 - 3634.78] P:1034.75 E:0.068348 |  that's already our first final,
[3634.78 - 3636.78] P:1148.54 E:0.086997 |  so every game now is going to be a final,
[3636.78 - 3640.78] P:1377.74 E:0.081671 |  I think it could have been better if we would have won today, obviously.
[3640.78 - 3642.78] P:1340.39 E:0.106239 |  The pressure wouldn't be that high,
[3642.78 - 3646.78] P:1191.67 E:0.063828 |  but now with that result today, we have to win.
[3646.78 - 3648.78] P:1418.50 E:0.096159 |  I think in general, with the performance,
[3648.78 - 3652.78] P:1077.58 E:0.085056 |  we know there's maybe still a lack of certain things,
[3652.78 - 3654.78] P:1151.53 E:0.103852 |  but when you look just on paper,
[3654.78 - 3656.78] P:1040.52 E:0.103984 |  I think we were quite dominant,
[3656.78 - 3659.78] P:1195.19 E:0.077292 |  and at the end of the day, we had the chances, you know,
[3659.78 - 3661.78] P:1186.95 E:0.096914 |  we had the chances to score earlier,
[3661.78 - 3664.78] P:1383.09 E:0.094768 |  the second one, even a third one, to be honest,
[3664.78 - 3666.78] P:1106.72 E:0.093567 |  where the keeper was also doing well,
[3666.78 - 3669.78] P:989.79 E:0.085960 |  we hit the post, I think the crossbar once,
[3669.78 - 3674.78] P:1319.45 E:0.076727 |  and I hit the post, so, yeah,
[3674.78 - 3677.78] P:1467.89 E:0.069190 |  I don't think we really played that bad, to be honest.
[3677.78 - 3679.78] P:1853.73 E:0.082765 |  Pat Ilke Gundurren makes an excellent point,
[3679.78 - 3681.78] P:1682.78 E:0.081049 |  which is that Germany dominated the game,
[3681.78 - 3683.78] P:1849.76 E:0.080549 |  they had plenty of chances,
[3683.78 - 3687.78] P:1834.67 E:0.095547 |  they missed opportunities by the narrowest of margins,
[3687.78 - 3690.78] P:1922.64 E:0.078858 |  and yet, it feels like Japan's performance
[3690.78 - 3692.78] P:1829.11 E:0.072060 |  deserved something from the game.
[3692.78 - 3695.78] P:1770.06 E:0.086955 |  I think the way they played the second half of Japanese,
[3695.78 - 3697.78] P:1844.85 E:0.092751 |  they were much lighter, I'd say, sides.
[3697.78 - 3699.78] P:1838.89 E:0.097940 |  I mean, I think most people just watch football,
[3699.78 - 3703.78] P:1840.16 E:0.100499 |  and if you've not got to say that you are behind right from the start,
[3703.78 - 3705.78] P:1959.59 E:0.103858 |  you want to say that it's trying harder,
[3705.78 - 3707.78] P:1908.28 E:0.090125 |  you want to say there's more energetic,
[3707.78 - 3710.78] P:1858.18 E:0.086358 |  there are lives there that are not just taking it all for granted,
[3710.78 - 3712.78] P:1631.27 E:0.065526 |  and that was the Japanese side in the second half,
[3712.78 - 3714.78] P:1662.77 E:0.099963 |  and I thought they were growing actually superb,
[3714.78 - 3715.78] P:1744.22 E:0.080663 |  and never stopped.
[3715.78 - 3718.78] P:1700.25 E:0.072361 |  I kept on waiting for them to run out of gas,
[3718.78 - 3721.78] P:1605.13 E:0.088078 |  and it never seemed to happen, so I was brilliant to say that,
[3721.78 - 3725.78] P:1872.31 E:0.073872 |  and of course, Gundurren has to kind of say that to some degree,
[3725.78 - 3730.78] P:1820.04 E:0.082360 |  but I don't think it's that amazing that the result ended up the way it was,
[3730.78 - 3732.78] P:1929.12 E:0.070560 |  purely by the way the game was played.
[3732.78 - 3735.78] P:1773.58 E:0.073646 |  And it is a shock, but can I suggest this to you?
[3735.78 - 3740.78] P:1824.33 E:0.075405 |  Here are the last games they played in competitions with Germans.
[3740.78 - 3743.78] P:1882.05 E:0.076153 |  In Russia, lost to Mexico, lost to South Korea,
[3743.78 - 3746.78] P:1734.15 E:0.077694 |  they won against Sweden in 95-minute, 95-minute winner.
[3746.78 - 3749.78] P:1859.70 E:0.074681 |  Euros lost to France, won Portugal,
[3749.78 - 3752.78] P:1744.62 E:0.069366 |  drew Hungary, lost England, this time lost Japan.
[3752.78 - 3755.78] P:1735.02 E:0.077059 |  That's play date, they've only won two.
[3755.78 - 3761.78] P:1730.96 E:0.075705 |  It isn't going to be a shock anymore if they keep on playing with major championships.
[3761.78 - 3765.78] P:1708.72 E:0.094067 |  And maybe it wasn't a shock in terms of, as you say, the form coming into this one,
[3765.78 - 3768.78] P:1673.78 E:0.091335 |  but that scoreline of Germany won Japan too,
[3768.78 - 3771.78] P:1772.88 E:0.089542 |  will still send shockwaves through this World Cup,
[3771.78 - 3774.78] P:1859.89 E:0.077243 |  especially because Germany haven't lost a World Cup game
[3774.78 - 3779.78] P:1900.06 E:0.092552 |  in which they led at half time since 1978 in Argentina
[3779.78 - 3784.78] P:1748.93 E:0.091376 |  when they were 3-2 up against Austria
[3784.78 - 3789.78] P:1767.97 E:0.083702 |  and they went unbeaten in their previous 21 matches like that before today.
[3789.78 - 3796.78] P:1864.10 E:0.084467 |  Spain though go on and make a 7-0 winning performance against Costa Rica
[3796.78 - 3798.78] P:1872.24 E:0.078768 |  and they were just extraordinary.
[3798.78 - 3801.78] P:1732.01 E:0.095506 |  And I know Costa Rica didn't put up much opposition,
[3801.78 - 3806.78] P:1813.26 E:0.078691 |  but it's still a game in which Spain have got a record of such narrow wins
[3806.78 - 3811.78] P:1813.22 E:0.085881 |  in these competitions that have a real chance.
[3811.78 - 3817.78] P:1859.28 E:0.080501 |  At least they look that way of going on and being some way successful in this competition.
[3817.78 - 3820.78] P:1515.46 E:0.087539 |  One quite line about them, very simple line about them.
[3820.78 - 3825.78] P:1926.10 E:0.075018 |  I didn't know when you commit this tournament, something a team can flourish.
[3825.78 - 3827.78] P:1706.93 E:0.083277 |  And I just didn't know about it.
[3827.78 - 3829.78] P:1798.22 E:0.094237 |  I thought it would be too early for the Spanish.
[3829.78 - 3832.78] P:1794.90 E:0.078750 |  You're seeing the petals opening now.
[3832.78 - 3834.78] P:1563.64 E:0.101430 |  We're absolutely seeing them opening now,
[3834.78 - 3837.78] P:1764.45 E:0.078945 |  so I think that's exciting for the Spanish.
[3837.78 - 3842.78] P:1665.72 E:0.084581 |  We could get anything from here on in, but the youngsters, they were brilliant today.
[3842.78 - 3845.78] P:1758.34 E:0.092062 |  They were fantastic. It was a brilliant performance from Spain,
[3845.78 - 3849.78] P:1798.17 E:0.084254 |  even regardless of the opposition with that 7-0 victory for them.
[3849.78 - 3853.78] P:1888.27 E:0.095339 |  Tomorrow there are four games for you as well, including one of the favourites,
[3853.78 - 3855.78] P:1834.39 E:0.091959 |  Brazil, yet to get their campaign underway.
[3855.78 - 3857.78] P:1880.24 E:0.087641 |  That's across Five Live and BBC sounds.
[3857.78 - 3863.78] P:1822.14 E:0.086506 |  You've got Rick Edwards on BBC Five Live Breakfast, rather, from Qatar from 6 o'clock in the morning.
[3863.78 - 3866.78] P:1720.55 E:0.090804 |  10 o'clock, Switzerland against Cameroon.
[3866.78 - 3869.78] P:1733.02 E:0.094852 |  1 o'clock is Uruguay against South Korea.
[3869.78 - 3873.78] P:1891.49 E:0.083070 |  Portugal take on Ghana at 4 o'clock.
[3873.78 - 3877.78] P:1893.97 E:0.085373 |  Guess who will be featured heavily ahead of that game.
[3877.78 - 3879.78] P:1619.80 E:0.102352 |  And then Brazil take on Serbia.
[3879.78 - 3881.78] P:1921.07 E:0.076111 |  That one is a 7 o'clock kickoff.
[3881.78 - 3885.78] P:1874.17 E:0.092544 |  You will not miss a single commentary here on Five Live Sporting.
[3885.78 - 3889.78] P:1719.86 E:0.084437 |  It will be covered right across Five Live and on BBC sounds.
[3889.78 - 3893.78] P:1780.05 E:0.090653 |  The players are getting set to come out of the tunnel for the second half
[3893.78 - 3896.78] P:1893.12 E:0.097827 |  in the game between Belgium and Canada.
[3896.78 - 3902.78] P:1838.45 E:0.088832 |  It's 1-0 to Belgium as things stand and therefore is for the second half.
[3902.78 - 3904.78] P:1662.54 E:0.094322 |  It's Dion Dublin and John Murray.
[3906.78 - 3908.78] P:1881.86 E:0.103798 |  Thank you very much, Kelly.
[3908.78 - 3911.78] P:1655.14 E:0.095668 |  It looks like Belgium are going to make a couple of changes.
[3911.78 - 3918.78] P:1715.62 E:0.099526 |  So even though they scored that goal late in the first half, Roberto Martinez is going to make those changes.
[3918.78 - 3923.78] P:1697.07 E:0.108611 |  We'll say thank you very much to Julian Laurent, who has been up here in our commentary position.
[3923.78 - 3927.78] P:1707.67 E:0.096744 |  We'll hear from Julian again, I'm sure, before too long at this World Cup.
[3927.78 - 3935.78] P:1559.62 E:0.100078 |  But the two changes, Dion, it looks like Kerasko has been taken up from the left-hand side, the left wing back.
[3935.78 - 3942.78] P:1554.85 E:0.096903 |  And as a result, instead, Castania is going to move across to the left.
[3942.78 - 3946.78] P:1607.96 E:0.092931 |  And Thomas Mounier has made his return.
[3946.78 - 3948.78] P:1650.27 E:0.096127 |  And he's got a mask on as well.
[3948.78 - 3952.78] P:1584.81 E:0.094221 |  Remember the problem with Thomas Mounier, the Borussia Dortmund man as he is now,
[3952.78 - 3954.78] P:1637.92 E:0.095014 |  is that he had a broken cheekbone.
[3954.78 - 3958.78] P:1626.70 E:0.091846 |  He broke his cheekbone last month and so was doubtful for this game.
[3958.78 - 3962.78] P:1592.19 E:0.089608 |  Roberto Martinez has brought him on at half-time.
[3962.78 - 3968.78] P:1619.26 E:0.088539 |  And the other change in central midfield, Keelamans has been taken off at half-time.
[3968.78 - 3973.78] P:1627.18 E:0.093146 |  And it's the young Evertonian, Amadou Onana, who has come on to replace him.
[3973.78 - 3979.78] P:1523.50 E:0.090148 |  Maybe they just want to get more control of the ball in there, maybe a bit more physical presence in there as well.
[3979.78 - 3982.78] P:1597.81 E:0.080965 |  I mean, I'm looking at Castania now.
[3982.78 - 3985.78] P:1571.81 E:0.097403 |  He's so much higher up the pitch than he was in the first half.
[3988.78 - 3993.78] P:1622.35 E:0.100477 |  So two changes for Roberto Martinez, but his team are winning by one goal to nil.
[3993.78 - 3997.78] P:1652.65 E:0.090135 |  But he can't have been happy with what he saw in the first half by a long shot,
[3997.78 - 4002.78] P:1575.99 E:0.085708 |  particularly the way that Belgium defended, conceded the penalty,
[4002.78 - 4006.78] P:1503.65 E:0.094342 |  which is a little unfortunate, one of those handballs from a powerful shot.
[4006.78 - 4013.78] P:1631.43 E:0.076204 |  But might have conceded at least one more penalty and could open on a number of occasions.
[4013.78 - 4018.78] P:1517.87 E:0.092008 |  Yeah, and that's just down to the hard work of the Canadian players.
[4018.78 - 4023.78] P:1440.88 E:0.080010 |  Now Belgium are trying to grasp this game, take control of it.
[4023.78 - 4026.78] P:1508.39 E:0.101056 |  They're making the pitch very, very big indeed.
[4026.78 - 4032.78] P:1491.84 E:0.078804 |  Big areas for the Canadian players to run into to try and squeeze now.
[4032.78 - 4034.78] P:1381.92 E:0.090633 |  It's going to be a different game in the second half.
[4034.78 - 4040.78] P:1518.20 E:0.083638 |  That's Dion Dublin with us here at the Akhmud bin Ali stadium,
[4040.78 - 4047.78] P:1634.77 E:0.088580 |  two-tier stadium all the way around, colourful red seats, purple hoardings everywhere.
[4047.78 - 4055.78] P:1710.78 E:0.075258 |  The pink World Cup livery, and I would have said something in the region of 35,000 or so people inside the stadium.
[4055.78 - 4056.78] P:1748.41 E:0.054461 |  So not quite full.
[4056.78 - 4059.78] P:1717.87 E:0.080766 |  Belgium leading by one goal to nil.
[4059.78 - 4062.78] P:1781.34 E:0.077435 |  Belgium in the red shirts with the black trim, black shorts,
[4062.78 - 4065.78] P:1430.41 E:0.085595 |  and these sort of black and red socks that have a design on them
[4065.78 - 4067.78] P:1689.60 E:0.088025 |  that makes it look as though their feet are on fire.
[4067.78 - 4070.78] P:1593.56 E:0.094672 |  There's sort of flames licking up from their boots, I know it is.
[4070.78 - 4077.78] P:1648.64 E:0.083703 |  And Canada in the all-white kit with the red trim, they've just won a free kick inside their own half Bat-Chouay.
[4077.78 - 4080.78] P:1740.93 E:0.079105 |  So Canada with the free kick and the teams.
[4080.78 - 4084.78] P:1664.69 E:0.078142 |  Now Courtois in goal for Belgium, the penalty saver in the first half.
[4084.78 - 4088.78] P:1598.95 E:0.075615 |  Dendonka, Aldervire Olden-Fortonghen are the three central defenders.
[4088.78 - 4092.78] P:1590.12 E:0.089565 |  Now Thomas Murnier the right wing back, Castaniers moved across to be the left wing back.
[4092.78 - 4096.78] P:1673.14 E:0.078367 |  And Nanna and Witzel in the middle, then De Bruyne, Azad and goal scorer Batchouay.
[4096.78 - 4103.78] P:1765.48 E:0.086879 |  Canada coming forward with Buchanan who's really been one of the brightest players for this Canadian team.
[4103.78 - 4107.78] P:1681.63 E:0.089902 |  Holds off the challenge from Castania, plays it back centrally.
[4107.78 - 4110.78] P:1708.76 E:0.101608 |  Lovely from Ustakayo, plays it into the error.
[4110.78 - 4113.78] P:1849.98 E:0.094501 |  Bound the header goes wide from David.
[4113.78 - 4116.78] P:1962.52 E:0.091578 |  Ten yards out, snatched at it really with his head.
[4116.78 - 4120.78] P:1769.02 E:0.095781 |  It was coming over his shoulder and he nodded it down and it bounced wide.
[4120.78 - 4122.78] P:1761.14 E:0.077385 |  It's a lovely ball as well isn't it?
[4122.78 - 4125.78] P:1708.13 E:0.094417 |  Should really score, he's eight yards out, it's not a bad header at all.
[4125.78 - 4131.78] P:1586.49 E:0.071677 |  I think he gets a nutmegs I think on Kevin De Bruyne.
[4131.78 - 4133.78] P:1708.44 E:0.098045 |  That'll go down in his history books.
[4133.78 - 4136.78] P:1660.71 E:0.090353 |  That was Ustakayo.
[4136.78 - 4139.78] P:1366.46 E:0.085921 |  Well that is definitely one too.
[4139.78 - 4144.78] P:1582.79 E:0.091393 |  It'll be clipping that one up once, the Oris Fernsdon family will be for the old social media.
[4145.78 - 4153.78] P:1638.13 E:0.075535 |  Belgium playing for Tonga has just gone down onto one knee and now climbs up and he seems okay.
[4153.78 - 4158.78] P:1700.71 E:0.089052 |  Castania is just looking at him there to see if he's alright but he is so the throwing is going to be taken.
[4158.78 - 4164.78] P:1755.97 E:0.079567 |  Great moment for Stefan Ustakayo who Julian was talking about, it wasn't he at half time.
[4164.78 - 4169.78] P:1654.94 E:0.066524 |  The Canadian number seven who plays for Porto,
[4169.78 - 4174.78] P:1545.37 E:0.092985 |  Porto started all of their group matches in the Champions League this season and they ended up winning the group.
[4174.78 - 4179.78] P:1622.34 E:0.072726 |  They'll play Inter in the last 16 and here come Belgium though.
[4179.78 - 4186.78] P:1829.31 E:0.067548 |  Wanderlup, Batua'i shifting from foot to foot, a little shimmy from him as well against Lariat
[4186.78 - 4190.78] P:1559.08 E:0.071843 |  and then passes the ball back into his own half and then a little tangle as well.
[4190.78 - 4195.78] P:1581.25 E:0.087686 |  A notice between Lariat and Batua'i off the ball just pushing one another away with their arms
[4195.78 - 4200.78] P:1742.88 E:0.064847 |  and then back the ball goes into the middle of the Belgian defence.
[4200.78 - 4207.78] P:1525.13 E:0.053841 |  Four minutes played in the second half and Azad allows the ball to bounce through
[4207.78 - 4213.78] P:1739.57 E:0.089475 |  but it doesn't reach Batua'i and that's a lovely turn from David away from the newly arrived Anana
[4213.78 - 4218.78] P:1743.23 E:0.084751 |  and now he has Alfonso Davis and Davis plays it square to Ustakayo but it just ran away from him.
[4218.78 - 4223.78] P:1728.24 E:0.093871 |  He's on his right foot though and he goes for goal from the angle but pulls it well wide across the face of goal.
[4223.78 - 4229.78] P:1688.75 E:0.085714 |  There were two men in there, Buchanan and David but it was whipped across them and wider the far left.
[4229.78 - 4235.78] P:1678.47 E:0.094475 |  Yeah he was never comfortable at all, he's 22 yards out, 23 yards out on the angle, Ustakayo just pulls it.
[4235.78 - 4241.78] P:1723.76 E:0.077221 |  Tebow-Corto are just letting that one just run off for a goal kick harmlessly.
[4241.78 - 4244.78] P:1747.30 E:0.095725 |  Davis there trying to get into those dangerous areas as well.
[4244.78 - 4249.78] P:1614.50 E:0.087174 |  If he can get forward a bit more they might get a little bit of joy. He's the key for them, he's the key for Canada.
[4249.78 - 4253.78] P:1703.41 E:0.081829 |  The ball being headed back by central defender Vittoria to his goalkeeper.
[4253.78 - 4256.78] P:1472.41 E:0.084581 |  I was asking you Deon, we never got a chance to get the answer.
[4256.78 - 4263.78] P:1629.24 E:0.086982 |  You know to be in a team that does what they did in the first half Canada and then to find themselves one-nil down to a late goal,
[4263.78 - 4268.78] P:1740.03 E:0.086677 |  the effect that that has but he has Junior Hoylert on the left hand side, the Reading man.
[4268.78 - 4274.78] P:1584.77 E:0.082845 |  Plays it back but a little bit short the pass and that meant that Murnier could get in there but Azad won't reach that
[4274.78 - 4280.78] P:1669.28 E:0.094847 |  and it's absolutely walloped forward by Vittoria who lands it in amongst the Canadian supporters over on the far side
[4280.78 - 4283.78] P:1465.28 E:0.080753 |  and they're absolutely loving that, they love that don't they in North American sport.
[4283.78 - 4284.78] P:1630.88 E:0.103106 |  Oh yes.
[4284.78 - 4287.78] P:1487.79 E:0.078287 |  The ball goes into the crowd, it's like the event of the night.
[4287.78 - 4291.78] P:1354.10 E:0.100659 |  Yes they have a bit of a juggle with it, hold on to it for a little while as well.
[4291.78 - 4296.78] P:1704.55 E:0.083255 |  But in answer to your question Johnny you can be kind of demoralising when you played so well
[4296.78 - 4301.78] P:1578.46 E:0.088781 |  and then you find yourself down at half time and you've dominated the first half for 35 minutes
[4301.78 - 4304.78] P:1718.78 E:0.073428 |  but it's just all about putting the ball in the back of the net.
[4304.78 - 4308.78] P:1760.57 E:0.093121 |  The ball played back to Courtois, he's got to be quick now that was hit with some pace by Castaña
[4308.78 - 4314.78] P:1675.47 E:0.086754 |  and Courtois had to get that under control and Buchanan wasn't far away from him but he did,
[4314.78 - 4319.78] P:1672.14 E:0.072711 |  he managed to get it down, get it away and Belgium have got it inside their own half.
[4319.78 - 4322.78] P:1526.38 E:0.094835 |  Witzel's going to give him another test with the back pass which he pulls onto his left foot
[4322.78 - 4325.78] P:1610.48 E:0.076872 |  and then passes out towards the left hand side.
[4325.78 - 4330.78] P:1527.44 E:0.081874 |  Good from Castaña to Kevin de Bruyne, a little bit deeper, it's Dion said in the first half
[4330.78 - 4337.78] P:1607.31 E:0.068553 |  we didn't see much of Kevin de Bruyne back inside his own half, I assume that is on orders
[4337.78 - 4343.78] P:1647.44 E:0.079986 |  from the manager, from Roberto Martinez, the former FA Cup winning manager with Wigan Athletic,
[4343.78 - 4350.78] P:1806.79 E:0.085865 |  Onnana, now to the right hand side, Amadou Onnana, the new signing for Everton
[4350.78 - 4358.78] P:1799.16 E:0.088726 |  at the start of this season from Lille, very highly thought of, 21 years old now here he is playing in a World Cup
[4358.78 - 4367.78] P:1712.34 E:0.071149 |  and Azard is inside his own half, halfway inside his own half and passing the ball back to Fatoum
[4367.78 - 4371.78] P:1452.27 E:0.088030 |  forward from Alderviro, Alderviro to whose pass led to the Batuay goal
[4371.78 - 4375.78] P:1632.53 E:0.095280 |  and now Eden Azard has got space, plays the ball in field, de Bruyne is there,
[4375.78 - 4382.78] P:1641.28 E:0.084462 |  square from him, into Onnana, Onnana, right footed ball, over hits it, what an opening that was for Onnana
[4382.78 - 4391.78] P:1652.70 E:0.073129 |  and Spade again, Belgium there, Onnana in the kind of position that, I'm tempted to say we just wouldn't see that in the Premier League
[4391.78 - 4396.78] P:1539.72 E:0.075677 |  No, absolutely not. The number of times Belgium have been given time and space and haven't taken advantage of it.
[4396.78 - 4402.78] P:1792.90 E:0.097905 |  No, it's just that wrong ball again, it's having so many options and choosing the wrong one every single time
[4402.78 - 4409.78] P:1726.92 E:0.068829 |  they should really be making better use of those chances that they have but they've got the goal they need at the moment
[4409.78 - 4417.78] P:1697.52 E:0.087439 |  It could be two, it could be three. It is only one though and it's been a collision there in centre field
[4417.78 - 4425.78] P:1678.37 E:0.090380 |  That's going to be a yellow card for Murnier from the Zambian referee, Yanni Sekazwe says that was an illegal challenge
[4425.78 - 4434.78] P:1620.90 E:0.074961 |  I guess he must have seen an arm, a flailing arm from Murnier, yes he did, on Junior Highlet he caught him with his forearm
[4434.78 - 4442.78] P:1617.75 E:0.071970 |  and Murnier who himself, last month fractured his cheekbone from an aerial challenge
[4442.78 - 4447.78] P:1570.94 E:0.099911 |  has caught Highlet who is okay, I'm pleased to say but it's a yellow card for Murnier
[4447.78 - 4453.78] P:1535.95 E:0.073437 |  Even though it was clumsy, very very clumsy but it's probably a subconscious thing there, thinking I've got to protect myself
[4453.78 - 4456.78] P:1483.81 E:0.075198 |  not a failing elbow at all but just caught him
[4456.78 - 4461.78] P:1594.24 E:0.078690 |  So Murnier is yellow card, it's a 60th cap tonight, Thomas Murnier
[4461.78 - 4467.78] P:1645.57 E:0.086708 |  So free kick then, as a result for Canada, forward and left of the centre circle, Belgium holding a very high line
[4467.78 - 4473.78] P:1740.80 E:0.063761 |  just waiting for the delivery from Bustacchio, who just waits and waits
[4473.78 - 4478.78] P:1669.97 E:0.067984 |  and now he comes up and he plays the free kick over the back line but he's put too much on
[4478.78 - 4485.78] P:1561.07 E:0.093997 |  And that's why, out of error he would say get out, he's seen to his team mates there, there was nine of them in a line
[4485.78 - 4489.78] P:1682.75 E:0.097467 |  red shirts, nine and don't go anywhere, he's got his arms out by his side
[4489.78 - 4493.78] P:1702.35 E:0.093636 |  like it's an error playing, they're saying this is the line, stay here
[4493.78 - 4497.78] P:1660.09 E:0.079661 |  and that forces the goalkeeper to have lots and lots of space
[4497.78 - 4503.78] P:1705.61 E:0.086790 |  And Dendonca has got to be careful here, David is putting a challenge in on him
[4503.78 - 4507.78] P:1698.68 E:0.101944 |  next to the dead ball line, that was playing out from the back, goes wrong again
[4507.78 - 4509.78] P:1826.84 E:0.096273 |  and it's resulted in a Canadian corner
[4509.78 - 4516.78] P:1697.18 E:0.082362 |  Yeah that's a really good play, really good play that is, forcing Belgium into another mistake
[4516.78 - 4520.78] P:1643.58 E:0.084450 |  See this could be dangerous, out from the corner, from the left hand side for Canada
[4520.78 - 4529.78] P:1652.23 E:0.078167 |  It is, so we'll see once again, Camal Miller just arriving in the penalty area
[4529.78 - 4537.78] P:1616.33 E:0.069611 |  He's the sort of guy who could really have a presence in the opposing penalty area
[4537.78 - 4543.78] P:1732.99 E:0.088743 |  Miller very strongly built, the corner is taken short and they lose it
[4543.78 - 4549.78] P:1676.94 E:0.072510 |  The belly got into the penalty area and Belgium were able to nip in and clear it away downfield
[4549.78 - 4554.78] P:1577.06 E:0.083971 |  In fact it was De Bruyne who was able to get in there and clear it away, that was a waste of opportunity
[4554.78 - 4558.78] P:1658.38 E:0.073931 |  Yeah get the ball in the box, you've got your centre halves up, I was a centre half now
[4558.78 - 4561.78] P:1508.45 E:0.103151 |  Scream and get the ball in the box, make sure you don't waste my time
[4561.78 - 4567.78] P:1809.02 E:0.087150 |  Lovely from Buchanan, hooked it over the top of Fadongan, goes for goal actually from the angle
[4567.78 - 4570.78] P:1809.63 E:0.102821 |  At least that's what I assume he was doing, maybe it was a cross
[4570.78 - 4573.78] P:1758.64 E:0.089402 |  But I think he saw Courtois perhaps off his line and went for it
[4573.78 - 4577.78] P:1621.63 E:0.087304 |  But he ballooned it, bent it way over the top of the crossbar from an impossible angle really
[4577.78 - 4581.78] P:1380.27 E:0.090038 |  It's not bad skill at all from Buchanan down the right hand side
[4581.78 - 4586.78] P:1658.08 E:0.078960 |  Fadongan there, he was just trying to head it and took it over his head and got the ball wrong
[4586.78 - 4591.78] P:1695.65 E:0.088749 |  John Herb is going to make a change and another Canadian player has gone down, that's another
[4591.78 - 4598.78] P:1764.17 E:0.096054 |  It was a Nanna who was going to come, he's booked for that, a Nanna coming together
[4598.78 - 4604.78] P:1729.66 E:0.088516 |  He was carrying the ball away and that is a yellow card for the other Belgian substitutes
[4604.78 - 4609.78] P:1503.12 E:0.089296 |  So both of the Belgian subs who came on at half time, a Nanna and Murnier have now been yellow carded
[4609.78 - 4614.78] P:1570.17 E:0.097171 |  I think he's actually been told to come on and just a bit more physical presence
[4614.78 - 4616.78] P:1576.81 E:0.104403 |  Not a lot in that to be honest with you
[4616.78 - 4618.78] P:1486.82 E:0.095109 |  Just an arm off, just a hand off
[4618.78 - 4623.78] P:1390.34 E:0.087035 |  Yeah, just a hand off there, may have caught him with the forearm but nothing at all, players are on the feet
[4623.78 - 4625.78] P:1654.16 E:0.061176 |  Yellow card though, he's got a yellow card for that
[4625.78 - 4629.78] P:1653.70 E:0.076508 |  The Canadian coach John Herbman is going to make a double change now
[4629.78 - 4634.78] P:1791.57 E:0.086715 |  There'll be his first two changes, Belgium are winning 1-0, this is 5-live and BBC sounds
[4634.78 - 4638.78] P:1688.18 E:0.082172 |  Wherever you go during the course of this World Cup, I know you'll be busy during the day
[4638.78 - 4642.78] P:1665.44 E:0.085093 |  These early kick-offs back at home, 10 o'clock in the morning
[4642.78 - 4647.78] P:1726.14 E:0.087571 |  You can follow us on your device via BBC sounds
[4647.78 - 4653.78] P:1698.88 E:0.078160 |  Here's Azard, I see Kyle Lahren of Club Bruges is going to be one of the players coming on for Canada
[4653.78 - 4658.78] P:1740.26 E:0.071586 |  They're centre forward, who is Canada's record scorer
[4658.78 - 4663.78] P:1659.27 E:0.071893 |  So John Herbman feeling that they're not able to find the net
[4663.78 - 4666.78] P:1509.91 E:0.097993 |  So he's going to bring on the man who scored more goals for Canada than anyone else
[4666.78 - 4671.78] P:1797.98 E:0.067862 |  And Ismail Cone is coming on as well, 20-year-old midfielder
[4671.78 - 4675.78] P:1760.47 E:0.063172 |  For his first taste of the World Cup
[4675.78 - 4683.78] P:1782.13 E:0.070594 |  And Junior Hoylert is the first number to go up, the number 10
[4683.78 - 4688.78] P:1868.44 E:0.079952 |  So Kyle Lahren coming on for him
[4689.78 - 4696.78] P:1792.64 E:0.099352 |  And it is Atiba Hutchinson as I did wonder whether he would last the distance
[4696.78 - 4704.78] P:1671.54 E:0.083483 |  And he's lasted almost an hour, the oldest player at this World Cup
[4704.78 - 4706.78] P:1697.25 E:0.096624 |  The oldest outfield player at this World Cup
[4706.78 - 4710.78] P:1675.54 E:0.086002 |  The second oldest outfield player ever to play in the World Cup
[4710.78 - 4714.78] P:1603.02 E:0.094771 |  Is now getting high fives and low fives and pats on the back from all of his teammates
[4714.78 - 4719.78] P:1308.70 E:0.102490 |  It's an amazing story, he just got a little bit leggy, he was getting heavy-legged
[4719.78 - 4722.78] P:1102.56 E:0.073064 |  39 years old, that's not bad
[4722.78 - 4725.78] P:1106.07 E:0.099831 |  Oh he tied at 39, wasn't playing international football at 39
[4725.78 - 4729.78] P:1207.10 E:0.092259 |  Well when I said to Vincent Company, he said there's someone playing in this match who's older than me
[4729.78 - 4735.78] P:1557.20 E:0.066792 |  So those two changes are made
[4735.78 - 4739.78] P:1534.48 E:0.073861 |  And as I say, it is Ismail Cone
[4739.78 - 4744.78] P:1781.30 E:0.074512 |  The 39 year old is replaced by the 20 year old in midfield
[4744.78 - 4750.78] P:1727.09 E:0.055084 |  And it is a free kick to Belgium, halfway inside their own half
[4750.78 - 4756.78] P:1702.92 E:0.075856 |  Great story, Cone as well at 20, he only made his professional debut in February
[4756.78 - 4762.78] P:1721.35 E:0.081070 |  And after seven appearances, won his first cap and now he's playing at the World Cup
[4762.78 - 4764.78] P:1761.78 E:0.073537 |  That's not bad
[4764.78 - 4769.78] P:1730.55 E:0.096713 |  And it is Canada, and here he is actually, the newly arrived, number 15 Cone
[4769.78 - 4773.78] P:1789.54 E:0.085006 |  Estaccio works it to the left hand side
[4773.78 - 4777.78] P:1756.46 E:0.102140 |  And Jonathan David is out there and he gets the ball down and he cuts in field on his right foot
[4777.78 - 4781.78] P:1602.55 E:0.090128 |  But he couldn't find the pass into the area, still battling for it on the edge of the box
[4781.78 - 4784.78] P:1732.41 E:0.078545 |  And it loops right across the edge of the penalty area
[4784.78 - 4786.78] P:1607.25 E:0.083318 |  And Belgium are able to clear it away
[4786.78 - 4791.78] P:1723.21 E:0.078310 |  In this second half, as we look, Canada in the white are playing from left to right
[4791.78 - 4795.78] P:1712.28 E:0.073664 |  And here the ball is played to the left hand side again
[4795.78 - 4800.78] P:1657.79 E:0.106682 |  And this time it's Buchanan who's over there and he's upended by Mounier who's already on a yellow card
[4800.78 - 4804.78] P:1719.26 E:0.083276 |  It is a free kick, I don't think it'll be any more than that, but he has to be careful
[4804.78 - 4810.78] P:1715.37 E:0.083790 |  Yeah, committed, Mounier there, really did, some nice little bit of foot to foot skill there
[4810.78 - 4814.78] P:1560.61 E:0.085052 |  Very, very good play from Buchanan, but you've got to do it more, you've got to do it more
[4814.78 - 4819.78] P:1684.91 E:0.070179 |  You've got to commit those players that have got a yellow card into challenges
[4819.78 - 4822.78] P:1255.61 E:0.083641 |  Are they going to be disciplined? Another high line as well
[4822.78 - 4825.78] P:1426.61 E:0.080540 |  Another high line from Belgium on the edge of the 18 yard line
[4825.78 - 4831.78] P:1609.07 E:0.084178 |  But now they've got the 6 foot 2 Kyle Lahren in there as well, the silent giant as they're calling
[4831.78 - 4835.78] P:1564.90 E:0.063126 |  It won't be silent if he puts this in the back of the net
[4835.78 - 4841.78] P:1692.01 E:0.089920 |  Canada still looking for their first goal at a World Cup in their second appearance at the tournament finals
[4841.78 - 4845.78] P:1901.08 E:0.086120 |  Free kick on the left hand side
[4845.78 - 4848.78] P:1746.81 E:0.106127 |  It's the Canadian fans voices that you can hear in that corner
[4848.78 - 4851.78] P:1698.19 E:0.092825 |  That's where all of the Wales fans were in this stadium the other night
[4851.78 - 4856.78] P:1679.32 E:0.091069 |  Here's the free kick from Estakio, he's put too much on that, bend it way beyond the far post and it's all the way through
[4856.78 - 4858.78] P:1747.69 E:0.084549 |  And another set piece of disappointment for Canada
[4858.78 - 4864.78] P:1599.86 E:0.089294 |  Yeah, that's poor from Estakio on the left hand side trying to curl it in towards the keeper
[4864.78 - 4868.78] P:1717.42 E:0.095304 |  But put it into that area where all the white shirt, don't try and put too much on it
[4868.78 - 4873.78] P:1651.32 E:0.059470 |  Just make sure it gets in the right area, that's the whole idea
[4873.78 - 4880.78] P:1709.39 E:0.081057 |  Belgium 1, Canada 0 and Belgium very nearly again lose the ball playing out from the back
[4880.78 - 4883.78] P:1659.62 E:0.093467 |  However this time they've been able to work it forward to Azad
[4883.78 - 4889.78] P:1653.08 E:0.053422 |  And Azad being challenged by Johnston, Azad back to Whitzel
[4889.78 - 4892.78] P:1525.95 E:0.058904 |  And Belgium now with the ball in centre field
[4892.78 - 4895.78] P:1463.28 E:0.068615 |  It's still uncomfortable for Belgium this
[4895.78 - 4901.78] P:1453.05 E:0.091859 |  It is, they want the game a little bit slower, they want it slow, quick, quick, slow
[4901.78 - 4904.78] P:1504.16 E:0.081317 |  That's how they want it, Canada wants it quick all the time
[4904.78 - 4910.78] P:1621.62 E:0.078586 |  So they're just trying to slow it down, draw out those white shirts and then they play their football Belgium
[4910.78 - 4917.78] P:1840.85 E:0.073807 |  And for Tongan under pressure, clearance is charged down by Davis
[4917.78 - 4920.78] P:1571.23 E:0.066785 |  And the ball is out of play for what he's given us as a throw
[4920.78 - 4926.78] P:1698.97 E:0.078078 |  We're going to see the latest Belgian change and it's Aidan Hazard, the captain is off
[4926.78 - 4934.78] P:1771.49 E:0.083642 |  So both captains have been substituted and coming on for Belgium, it is the Brighton man Leandro Trossard
[4934.78 - 4940.78] P:1673.91 E:0.081640 |  Who personally I feel is one of the best players in the Premier League this season
[4940.78 - 4945.78] P:1776.06 E:0.089499 |  Every time I see him, he impresses me, scored a hat-triggered Anfield this season
[4945.78 - 4949.78] P:1865.07 E:0.087137 |  And here he comes now for his first taste of the World Cup
[4949.78 - 4957.78] P:1648.13 E:0.088480 |  Leandro Trossard replaces Aidan Hazard, who has what, slitted in and out of the game Aidan Hazard tonight
[4957.78 - 4963.78] P:1362.84 E:0.090925 |  Yeah, he's wanting to do what he's done for years but he just hasn't got that lightning pace anymore
[4963.78 - 4968.78] P:1477.02 E:0.091360 |  Great feet, great balance but hasn't affected the game as he wanted to
[4968.78 - 4972.78] P:1655.87 E:0.095771 |  Canada with the ball on the right hand side, it is played back, Buchanan's onto this
[4972.78 - 4978.78] P:1802.82 E:0.086996 |  But he gets right underneath the shot and he has almost landed it in the middle tier
[4978.78 - 4985.78] P:1617.21 E:0.089013 |  Of the stadium, in fact it was caught there by a spectator who is standing right on the back row of the lower tier
[4985.78 - 4993.78] P:1679.49 E:0.087102 |  And that also was wasteful from Buchanan, who's been excellent, he's been excellent all the way up to that final third
[4993.78 - 4999.78] P:1564.85 E:0.095831 |  That final third, that last shot, that last pass, I mean Buchanan there, the ball's ended up on the edge of the D
[4999.78 - 5004.78] P:1743.60 E:0.095155 |  20 yards out, 25 yards out and he wound himself up that much that it's just landed
[5004.78 - 5009.78] P:1523.16 E:0.090672 |  Nearly in that second tier, just take your time, that's what I was saying to Kelly at half time
[5009.78 - 5014.78] P:1622.12 E:0.084090 |  If they could calm down with their finishing, they might have a more of a chance in this game
[5014.78 - 5017.78] P:1551.21 E:0.056590 |  So you've got to say, telling Kelly to calm down
[5017.78 - 5022.78] P:1790.88 E:0.068493 |  Oh no, nobody can get Kelly to calm down, you're joking, impossible
[5022.78 - 5029.78] P:1651.53 E:0.073502 |  Well, Belgium 1, Canada 0 is the score and we've got just over 25 minutes to play
[5029.78 - 5037.78] P:1775.68 E:0.067982 |  Four more commentaries tomorrow as the final two groups get underway, groups G and H
[5037.78 - 5044.78] P:1768.15 E:0.079391 |  So tomorrow night, this time if you're listening to Five Live, you will be listening to Brazil against Serbia
[5044.78 - 5050.78] P:1560.65 E:0.076903 |  Which I think is an interesting one, but whenever Brazil play at the World Cup, you want to be tuned into it
[5050.78 - 5054.78] P:1710.29 E:0.056580 |  Belgium with it, with Trossard
[5054.78 - 5066.78] P:1758.37 E:0.074416 |  And now Murnier, and Murnier's crosses deflected straight behind by the defender, by Vittoria for a corner to Roberto Martín as a side
[5066.78 - 5071.78] P:1579.94 E:0.092801 |  Yeah, Trossard in such good form in the Premier League, it wouldn't surprise me if he gets himself on the scoresheet
[5071.78 - 5074.78] P:1631.44 E:0.082772 |  He doesn't panic when he gets in front of goal
[5074.78 - 5081.78] P:1720.46 E:0.090778 |  Kevin De Bruyne who's being cheered there, that's the area where most of the Belgian supporters are gathered in there
[5081.78 - 5088.78] P:1580.60 E:0.082319 |  The Red Devils, Le Diable Rouge, and they've got their wigs and they've got their Belgian flags
[5088.78 - 5097.78] P:1690.84 E:0.079367 |  And they're watching Kevin De Bruyne take this corner, a deep one to the back post that is headed down by Dendonca
[5097.78 - 5103.78] P:1644.15 E:0.067755 |  And there might have been a handball in there and it's a free kick to Canada on the edge of their own penalty area
[5103.78 - 5109.78] P:1609.39 E:0.069071 |  So Canada will reset themselves again, one-nil Belgium lead, Batuay's go
[5109.78 - 5116.78] P:1551.61 E:0.084725 |  Yeah, even though Belgium have started to get a grip of this game and play it at their pace, there's only one goal in this game
[5116.78 - 5124.78] P:1687.12 E:0.078064 |  Canada still can get something out of this game if they can find a little bit more form than they had in the first half, a bit more confidence
[5124.78 - 5126.78] P:1719.14 E:0.048347 |  They're still in this game
[5126.78 - 5132.78] P:1675.45 E:0.079157 |  Here's Onana, Onana in the centre circle, this is powerful still from him, takes it on into the penalty area
[5132.78 - 5140.78] P:1736.65 E:0.094529 |  And then it bounces away from him, it might have been fouled right on the edge of the box by Cone who went with him
[5140.78 - 5145.78] P:1763.27 E:0.081063 |  And he could have gone down, he stumbled, he missed control of the ball and it bounced away from him
[5145.78 - 5150.78] P:1700.08 E:0.095319 |  Yeah, I think he'd actually got away from Cone but then his touch was bad and it went into the keeper
[5150.78 - 5157.78] P:1779.47 E:0.065229 |  He lost his balance, he actually did well to stay on his feet there and he could have shot for goal but his touch was poor
[5157.78 - 5160.78] P:1692.46 E:0.081467 |  That might have been a foul on Fatongan, no it's not given
[5160.78 - 5165.78] P:1670.76 E:0.093806 |  And so Kyle Lahren is able to take it on and pass it back towards the edge of the penalty area
[5165.78 - 5171.78] P:1757.99 E:0.096412 |  And it's worked square by Davis and Estaccio's under this and Estaccio's square to Davis again who tried to give him it back
[5171.78 - 5177.78] P:1767.45 E:0.100656 |  But he gave it straight to Belgium and it bounced forward to De Bruyne and De Bruyne has passed to Batuaille
[5177.78 - 5182.78] P:1738.78 E:0.087882 |  He is intercepted by a sliding Camal Miller who gets to his feet and celebrates
[5182.78 - 5187.78] P:1621.32 E:0.088929 |  The fact that he put in what was a very important challenge and took the ball away from Batuaille
[5187.78 - 5191.78] P:1741.14 E:0.079074 |  So Canada again, come forward, Buchanan now on the left hand side
[5191.78 - 5197.78] P:1732.39 E:0.079614 |  He's very much in a roving sort of role, Buchanan and then Davis to the right, Johnston
[5197.78 - 5205.78] P:1779.11 E:0.083786 |  Now it's hit low and well wide actually by Larria with a shot, sort of snapshot from the edge of the area from a slight angle on the right
[5205.78 - 5207.78] P:1671.05 E:0.079679 |  But wider than near post by a yard
[5207.78 - 5213.78] P:1563.79 E:0.095968 |  Yeah, good for Canada though because they're getting more of Davis on the ball in that sort of central area so it can affect things
[5213.78 - 5218.78] P:1519.68 E:0.085510 |  I'm very surprised that I think I've seen Kevin De Bruyne misplace two passes tonight
[5218.78 - 5220.78] P:1437.14 E:0.091734 |  Important passes as well
[5222.78 - 5226.78] P:1759.00 E:0.071905 |  Belgium playing the ball out from the back again
[5226.78 - 5229.78] P:1648.59 E:0.062201 |  That's what they want, Belgium, they want this second goal
[5229.78 - 5235.78] P:1693.24 E:0.095200 |  And here is Kevin De Bruyne who rides two challenges and he's got away from Portofen
[5235.78 - 5241.78] P:1879.23 E:0.101722 |  And De Bruyne now, square to Batuaille, right foot shot is blocked and a super block that was
[5241.78 - 5246.78] P:1883.83 E:0.095983 |  Larria coming back and throwing himself in front of Batuaille as he hit the shot
[5246.78 - 5249.78] P:1778.92 E:0.097641 |  And was able to deflect it well wide and behind for a corner
[5249.78 - 5254.78] P:1717.94 E:0.098014 |  That is brilliant defending by the way because Kevin De Bruyne is on the right hand side
[5254.78 - 5261.78] P:1792.09 E:0.093234 |  I think it's Trossard that's flying in, he's taking all the defenders away and Larria has come from 30, 40 yards
[5261.78 - 5267.78] P:1782.81 E:0.077366 |  Splinted, what a block, brilliant block, 18 yards out
[5267.78 - 5270.78] P:1665.65 E:0.076084 |  Saved himself and his team an extra goal
[5270.78 - 5277.78] P:1645.47 E:0.091439 |  Here's the corner though for Belgium from De Bruyne that is headed up in the air and then Canada clear
[5277.78 - 5285.78] P:1554.58 E:0.074580 |  But that's a slip and that means Belgium are back in business with Trossard who over hits the pass to Witzel on the left hand side
[5285.78 - 5289.78] P:1627.40 E:0.078441 |  But Batuaille is out there as well and now the ball is played centrally on Nanna
[5289.78 - 5296.78] P:1639.53 E:0.074193 |  A touch to his right to Murnier, De Bruyne is there as well, this is 30 yards from the Canadian goal
[5296.78 - 5301.78] P:1671.83 E:0.082391 |  Trossard in a central position and the Brighton man gives it to the Leicester man, Castagna
[5301.78 - 5306.78] P:1709.34 E:0.092476 |  And now Batuaille inside the box, he's got to beat two men, he's still going inside the penalty area
[5306.78 - 5311.78] P:1677.37 E:0.091839 |  But eventually it gets away from him, there were just too many legs in there in the end, Canadian legs that is
[5311.78 - 5313.78] P:1694.55 E:0.090056 |  And they were able to scrape it away
[5313.78 - 5322.78] P:1729.60 E:0.083067 |  Yeah that defence not moving on that occasion, not getting sucked into the good play that Belgium are having now in 30 yards
[5322.78 - 5324.78] P:1480.56 E:0.046394 |  In the final third
[5327.78 - 5331.78] P:1626.38 E:0.074908 |  The ball back with Couretois in the goal to our right
[5333.78 - 5340.78] P:1618.89 E:0.082683 |  Batongan back to Couretois and his long clearance to the half way line is headed in field by Johnston
[5340.78 - 5347.78] P:1594.12 E:0.059509 |  And now Witzel back to Trossard again, this is still in the central third of the field
[5348.78 - 5354.78] P:1495.61 E:0.071262 |  And Witzel will play it back into the line of the three central defenders
[5354.78 - 5359.78] P:1486.04 E:0.080206 |  Then Donka on the right hand side, now Murnier with the black mask on his face, on Nanna
[5359.78 - 5362.78] P:1485.77 E:0.096389 |  Turn from him, that was clever stuff
[5362.78 - 5367.78] P:1589.84 E:0.085677 |  Witzel then sends it forward to De Bruyne, whose pass is over hit again, Dion
[5367.78 - 5370.78] P:1536.25 E:0.091188 |  Over hit from the great man, Couretois, goalkeeper
[5370.78 - 5376.78] P:1376.44 E:0.102408 |  Not quite on it at the moment De Bruyne, he's getting more and more of the ball and he's going to continue to affect this game in a positive way
[5376.78 - 5381.78] P:1673.76 E:0.080038 |  He's in the middle of the pot, right in the centre of the pitch, he's got Witzel behind him
[5381.78 - 5385.78] P:1741.87 E:0.074105 |  He's got Trossard in front of him, he's just left to do what he needs to do
[5385.78 - 5390.78] P:1631.60 E:0.074508 |  He's got the protection all around him, so those misplaced passes will become good ones very very soon
[5390.78 - 5396.78] P:1690.56 E:0.066956 |  That's Dion Dublin with us here in Qatar at the World Cup
[5398.78 - 5401.78] P:1582.83 E:0.085091 |  And Belgium with Witzel inside their own half
[5401.78 - 5406.78] P:1650.13 E:0.070765 |  The other thing that will be happening tomorrow as well as four more World Cup commentaries
[5406.78 - 5412.78] P:1659.77 E:0.084310 |  England and Wales will be doing their talking tomorrow ahead of the second group matches
[5412.78 - 5417.78] P:1535.54 E:0.075404 |  That will be played on Friday, so that will be played on Thursday
[5417.78 - 5425.78] P:1800.44 E:0.084633 |  As the ball bounces forward towards De Bruyne, but it bounces away from him
[5426.78 - 5431.78] P:1736.01 E:0.097444 |  Kostanio was trying to take it on, but Canada have cleared it downfield and then out from the back
[5431.78 - 5433.78] P:1536.90 E:0.080334 |  Then Donca comes to put it out of play on the far side
[5433.78 - 5437.78] P:1629.08 E:0.105108 |  They had a chance then Canada, they broke down for Belgium, it was five on five
[5437.78 - 5441.78] P:1894.27 E:0.077057 |  They really should have went with pace, chose the right decisions
[5441.78 - 5447.78] P:1775.09 E:0.076275 |  I think it was David there and Larrin choosing the wrong options, not getting past that first red shirt
[5447.78 - 5449.78] P:1787.86 E:0.050929 |  Another good chance gone
[5449.78 - 5453.78] P:1716.77 E:0.059685 |  Here's Buchanan on the left hand side, Buchanan moving infield
[5453.78 - 5458.78] P:1732.54 E:0.068553 |  And then a little touch out to the far side by Kyle Larrin
[5458.78 - 5462.78] P:1719.99 E:0.074482 |  And then Canada played, that's a misplaced pass actually
[5462.78 - 5466.78] P:1586.32 E:0.093591 |  And Estaccio had to be sharp there, otherwise Trossard was on to that, but he was
[5466.78 - 5471.78] P:1750.16 E:0.083933 |  He just got there, the Porto man, and now he's on his feet again, but over hits the pass through
[5471.78 - 5474.78] P:1765.61 E:0.083984 |  And Alderviral can come across and put it out of play
[5474.78 - 5479.78] P:1741.56 E:0.065227 |  Davis takes a quick throw to Estaccio, Davis again Alfonso Davis
[5479.78 - 5482.78] P:1650.84 E:0.080834 |  Always giving it away, he's passed the ball to Kevin De Bruyne
[5482.78 - 5485.78] P:1517.65 E:0.089260 |  That could be costly, and De Bruyne has got away from Johnston
[5485.78 - 5489.78] P:1596.46 E:0.094307 |  And now Kevin De Bruyne making ground up the left hand side, he's gone for the early pass
[5489.78 - 5493.78] P:1670.74 E:0.092523 |  Batchouais on the far side of the penalty area, tried to pull it down
[5493.78 - 5496.78] P:1731.85 E:0.082400 |  But the touch was heavy and ran away from him out for a throw on the far side
[5496.78 - 5500.78] P:1634.50 E:0.095498 |  Yeah, the correct ball from Kevin De Bruyne, but it was just a poor touch from Batswijk
[5500.78 - 5504.78] P:1865.95 E:0.079751 |  And then his left shoulder trying to bring it down on the volley, tough tough
[5504.78 - 5507.78] P:1643.39 E:0.079192 |  Normally when we see Kevin De Bruyne put those sort of passes across
[5507.78 - 5515.78] P:1736.59 E:0.072633 |  It's not meant to be disrespectful to Batchouais, but you see people like Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden
[5515.78 - 5517.78] P:1893.52 E:0.067399 |  Pulling those down into the ground
[5517.78 - 5520.78] P:1620.33 E:0.071940 |  Yeah, playing in a completely different way
[5520.78 - 5524.78] P:1688.54 E:0.089855 |  He has Buchanan though, running forward for Canada and playing the ball behind Kyle Lahren
[5524.78 - 5526.78] P:1607.51 E:0.083060 |  So Belgium were able to get that away again
[5526.78 - 5528.78] P:1430.86 E:0.106816 |  That's happened so many times, isn't it?
[5528.78 - 5534.78] P:1664.65 E:0.079641 |  So much positive play from Canada, really asking questions and posing problems for Belgium
[5534.78 - 5535.78] P:1661.38 E:0.104296 |  So really
[5535.78 - 5540.78] P:1692.63 E:0.073868 |  The final pass, it's just, you know, it's sometimes a great run
[5540.78 - 5544.78] P:1721.20 E:0.066913 |  But then the play on the balls played the pass where he was stood
[5544.78 - 5548.78] P:1768.85 E:0.084836 |  And it just seems to be falling into the hands of a redshirt every single time
[5548.78 - 5550.78] P:1538.45 E:0.096440 |  But they're being incredibly positive still, Canada
[5550.78 - 5553.78] P:1650.81 E:0.096123 |  Kone's come on and made a difference, Buchanan's really positive as well
[5553.78 - 5557.78] P:1763.53 E:0.088691 |  Lahren's really trying to make as many runs as he possibly can
[5557.78 - 5560.78] P:1627.67 E:0.083677 |  They're still in this one and they're very positive with their play
[5560.78 - 5563.78] P:1709.11 E:0.077593 |  Canada again with it in the centre circle, Vittoria goes for the long pass
[5563.78 - 5567.78] P:1686.17 E:0.085480 |  Lahren's come for it, but he was well watched actually by Dendonka
[5567.78 - 5570.78] P:1554.88 E:0.074820 |  Who was able to move across and head it down
[5570.78 - 5574.78] P:1629.55 E:0.085492 |  Grones from the Belgian fans inside the ground, Batchouais
[5574.78 - 5577.78] P:1680.88 E:0.084271 |  It doesn't stick with him again, so Canada play it forward
[5577.78 - 5579.78] P:1633.64 E:0.090711 |  But Johnston's beaten to it by Castania
[5579.78 - 5584.78] P:1634.22 E:0.068768 |  Castania just has to check back and now Trossard turns
[5584.78 - 5588.78] P:1665.96 E:0.068696 |  And then gives it to Kevin De Bruyne just forward of the centre circle
[5588.78 - 5591.78] P:1649.67 E:0.097917 |  And he finds Batchouais out towards the right-hand side
[5591.78 - 5594.78] P:1777.77 E:0.081730 |  Now back to Trossard, edge of the box on his left foot
[5594.78 - 5597.78] P:1763.61 E:0.083567 |  The tackle's going and the tackle was effective actually
[5597.78 - 5601.78] P:1803.77 E:0.053779 |  In the end from Vittoria
[5601.78 - 5605.78] P:1707.26 E:0.059748 |  Who was able to take it away from Trossard
[5605.78 - 5608.78] P:1608.46 E:0.081966 |  Long pass downfield for Canada, but I think that's asking too much
[5608.78 - 5611.78] P:1594.86 E:0.074725 |  Of Lariat it is and it's through for a goal kick
[5611.78 - 5614.78] P:1696.38 E:0.098976 |  One-nil Belgium lead
[5614.78 - 5617.78] P:1783.94 E:0.066453 |  Just to clarify
[5617.78 - 5620.78] P:1560.51 E:0.082241 |  Beginning to lose track of what day of the week it is here
[5620.78 - 5624.78] P:1437.19 E:0.097332 |  It's a wetten's day today, so tomorrow England and Wales will be doing their talking
[5624.78 - 5630.78] P:1660.04 E:0.082527 |  And then on Friday it will be England against USA and Wales against Iran
[5630.78 - 5635.78] P:1706.90 E:0.076114 |  Another change for Canada
[5635.78 - 5642.78] P:1602.86 E:0.082159 |  Sam Adakubi has come on to replace Lariat
[5642.78 - 5645.78] P:1509.05 E:0.086449 |  Who was playing on the right-hand side of midfield
[5645.78 - 5650.78] P:1466.53 E:0.078068 |  Now Adakubi as a left back
[5650.78 - 5656.78] P:1694.72 E:0.080904 |  Plays in Turkey for Haidtay Spor in the Turkish Super League
[5656.78 - 5660.78] P:1526.31 E:0.063347 |  So he has gone over there onto the left-hand side
[5660.78 - 5663.78] P:1619.95 E:0.055140 |  So that is the number three for Canada
[5663.78 - 5666.78] P:1533.45 E:0.069378 |  John Hoedman has certainly switched it up here hasn't he
[5666.78 - 5671.78] P:1718.29 E:0.052380 |  In terms of rather Graham Potter like
[5671.78 - 5678.78] P:1633.64 E:0.068516 |  He's been moving his pieces around the various formations that he's deployed here
[5678.78 - 5682.78] P:1528.97 E:0.076580 |  Davis Alfonso Davis has had a spell on the right-hand side
[5682.78 - 5684.78] P:1561.49 E:0.059208 |  He's played at left back
[5684.78 - 5689.78] P:1603.12 E:0.083296 |  Now Adakubi has come on at left back and Davis has gone over into left midfield
[5689.78 - 5692.78] P:1737.50 E:0.073955 |  And Belgium played forward but that will bounce through to goalkeeper
[5692.78 - 5694.78] P:1620.78 E:0.098135 |  He's back in his bench isn't he? He's back in his bench
[5694.78 - 5698.78] P:1606.91 E:0.097895 |  He likes his squad, he trusts everybody and everybody is getting some bit of time
[5698.78 - 5701.78] P:1548.41 E:0.083717 |  And if he needs to bring off some of the players that have done well from today
[5701.78 - 5707.78] P:1606.62 E:0.057595 |  Then he knows he looks over his shoulder and he thinks, yeah I trust my bench
[5707.78 - 5712.78] P:1708.18 E:0.055192 |  One-nil Belgium lead, so this match is still in the balance
[5712.78 - 5714.78] P:1459.79 E:0.079079 |  And it's a performance this
[5714.78 - 5718.78] P:1607.82 E:0.074180 |  I've seen enough tournament football and seen teams play their opening matches
[5718.78 - 5723.78] P:1597.17 E:0.077507 |  To know that this is a performance that will receive some criticism in Belgium
[5723.78 - 5728.78] P:1611.58 E:0.074786 |  I'm absolutely certain of that unless they've run away with it in the last 15 minutes or whatever
[5728.78 - 5734.78] P:1741.22 E:0.069305 |  But Canada have posed them problems and I think it's going to be very interesting to see what happens to Canada
[5734.78 - 5737.78] P:1696.64 E:0.081624 |  From this point on their matches against Croatia and Morocco
[5737.78 - 5740.78] P:1531.26 E:0.085618 |  Ball on the left-hand side but that's an easy one for Belgium to deal with
[5740.78 - 5743.78] P:1722.44 E:0.072226 |  And Courtois pluses it away from the back
[5743.78 - 5746.78] P:1649.78 E:0.081869 |  15 minutes or thereabouts to go, plus added time
[5746.78 - 5748.78] P:1639.99 E:0.059994 |  That might be another 15 minutes
[5748.78 - 5751.78] P:1675.95 E:0.077607 |  Belgium left-footed ball forward to the halfway line
[5751.78 - 5753.78] P:1645.98 E:0.073722 |  That Miller heads that forward
[5753.78 - 5755.78] P:1851.26 E:0.030800 |  And now
[5755.78 - 5759.78] P:1853.58 E:0.061797 |  Atacoubi it is getting his first touches of the match
[5759.78 - 5764.78] P:1582.91 E:0.074770 |  Londoner Atacoubi incidentally did have a spell at Brighton on loan
[5764.78 - 5767.78] P:1785.68 E:0.091059 |  He's played in Norway, now he's playing in the World Cup
[5767.78 - 5770.78] P:1756.07 E:0.099666 |  And now we're watching Buchanan on the right-hand side again
[5770.78 - 5775.78] P:1808.50 E:0.087569 |  Buchanan plays it across, Lauren the ball got away from him at the crucial moment
[5775.78 - 5778.78] P:1642.36 E:0.090061 |  And Alderv-Ireld was able to step in and clear it away
[5778.78 - 5783.78] P:1652.07 E:0.055353 |  Buchanan sat down, he might have a problem
[5783.78 - 5786.78] P:1810.40 E:0.086014 |  He's certainly hoping not, he's trying to get to his feet
[5786.78 - 5789.78] P:1477.71 E:0.051438 |  Is it cramp, Jonas just cramp? Ah that's okay
[5789.78 - 5791.78] P:1696.09 E:0.040653 |  Stacchio
[5791.78 - 5796.78] P:1682.44 E:0.063477 |  Right-footed pass right across the field to the left-hand side here
[5796.78 - 5803.78] P:1686.15 E:0.067991 |  And then back it goes into the centre-circle to the chiseled beard of Vittoria
[5803.78 - 5808.78] P:1605.18 E:0.058912 |  Slip from Cone but he's able to get up and play it back
[5808.78 - 5811.78] P:1562.03 E:0.079778 |  And the ball is worked over towards the left-hand side
[5811.78 - 5814.78] P:1568.39 E:0.076268 |  They're going to make another couple of changes, one apiece
[5814.78 - 5820.78] P:1617.45 E:0.072193 |  For Canada, Jonathan Asorio is going to come onto the field
[5820.78 - 5822.78] P:1730.75 E:0.071274 |  His Colombian heritage
[5822.78 - 5827.78] P:1684.39 E:0.084097 |  They are an exceptionally diverse bunch as well, this Canadian squad
[5827.78 - 5831.78] P:1778.15 E:0.092719 |  There's heritage there from all over the world
[5831.78 - 5838.78] P:1741.73 E:0.073833 |  There's a long passes played forward towards the left-hand side for Canada
[5838.78 - 5841.78] P:1627.62 E:0.078287 |  That is Davis who is over there again
[5841.78 - 5845.78] P:1573.90 E:0.092311 |  Adacubi hits a high ball to Larria on the edge of the penalty area
[5845.78 - 5849.78] P:1727.48 E:0.097169 |  And now the shot on the turn from David that hit a body in there
[5849.78 - 5853.78] P:1730.93 E:0.089007 |  And hopefully in the crowd amongst all of those maple leaves on the far side
[5853.78 - 5856.78] P:1284.70 E:0.085158 |  For a possible penalty but nothing doing certainly for that one
[5856.78 - 5859.78] P:1727.93 E:0.076951 |  Buchanan who's shaken off his little bout of cramp
[5859.78 - 5863.78] P:1664.10 E:0.086360 |  He crosses from the right and Belgium cleared away on the edge of the box
[5863.78 - 5868.78] P:1583.24 E:0.069110 |  Adacubi again on the left-hand side with the turquoise boots
[5868.78 - 5872.78] P:1658.07 E:0.088392 |  Now Stacchio who's been very influential in the midfield in this match
[5872.78 - 5875.78] P:1520.43 E:0.045628 |  The number seven
[5875.78 - 5879.78] P:1657.37 E:0.084599 |  Vittoria, the central defender right footed pass from him out to the far side
[5879.78 - 5883.78] P:1639.24 E:0.083887 |  Now Jump and Murnier gets there first and heads it out of play away from Adacubi
[5883.78 - 5885.78] P:1664.72 E:0.090898 |  Throwing to Canada and we will see these changes now
[5885.78 - 5889.78] P:1545.15 E:0.070795 |  So Jonathan Asorio coming on for Canada
[5889.78 - 5894.78] P:1791.32 E:0.079869 |  But first it is going to be Lewis Appenda coming on to replace Baciuai
[5894.78 - 5898.78] P:1508.81 E:0.088173 |  Who I think has laboured a little bit in the second half
[5898.78 - 5904.78] P:1731.75 E:0.084175 |  The young forward Appenda who actually scored in that warm-up match against Egypt
[5904.78 - 5908.78] P:1789.44 E:0.087835 |  Last week the Lons striker 22 years old
[5908.78 - 5911.78] P:1701.22 E:0.079915 |  He's going to replace the goal scorer Baciuai
[5911.78 - 5914.78] P:1710.01 E:0.086613 |  Yeah Baciuai just got a little bit lazy in the latter stages
[5914.78 - 5917.78] P:1517.84 E:0.087067 |  He's going to be a bit leggy of course he has took his goal brilliantly
[5917.78 - 5921.78] P:1392.85 E:0.090904 |  Yes he did but I think the players in and around have got a bit frustrated
[5921.78 - 5925.78] P:1602.05 E:0.089078 |  He started to flick things and not hold it in and put his team under pressure
[5925.78 - 5930.78] P:1487.00 E:0.094684 |  So get him off, get him fresh legs again, bit of a rest and getting ready for the next game
[5930.78 - 5934.78] P:1444.41 E:0.092608 |  So Appenda is on, no Lukaku if you're wondering by the way
[5934.78 - 5939.78] P:1597.67 E:0.079218 |  He's had a hamstring problem and so Roberto Martínez taking no chances with him
[5939.78 - 5943.78] P:1542.18 E:0.072893 |  With most of the World Cup still ahead of us
[5943.78 - 5948.78] P:1575.58 E:0.074249 |  But Appenda is on up front and the ball bounces off by a distance actually
[5948.78 - 5953.78] P:1737.05 E:0.066860 |  But he's able to chase after it and Belgium move forward again
[5953.78 - 5958.78] P:1597.35 E:0.060736 |  But the ball to the left hand side, Castagna to Trossard who tried to give him it back
[5958.78 - 5962.78] P:1605.60 E:0.072946 |  But Buchanan is there and Buchanan is being manhandled by Castagna
[5962.78 - 5964.78] P:1511.98 E:0.090186 |  And that is a clear free kick
[5964.78 - 5967.78] P:1526.09 E:0.094956 |  Didn't like that did he Buchanan? Hey, bit of physical contact
[5967.78 - 5970.78] P:1773.76 E:0.065106 |  He's still trying to jump off that cramp
[5970.78 - 5974.78] P:1680.15 E:0.078500 |  It's so painful when you get bowed to cramp in one area
[5974.78 - 5976.78] P:1672.45 E:0.063499 |  It's really hard to get rid of
[5976.78 - 5979.78] P:1446.02 E:0.085708 |  If you're on your way home tonight this match is live on BBC Television incident
[5979.78 - 5981.78] P:1425.20 E:0.090268 |  You might be able to see the last knockings of it
[5981.78 - 5984.78] P:1706.02 E:0.089340 |  You might see Canada's first goal at a World Cup
[5984.78 - 5987.78] P:1868.81 E:0.067622 |  If they're able to find a way through
[5987.78 - 5990.78] P:1619.65 E:0.081511 |  At the moment, they had a chance early on in the match
[5990.78 - 5992.78] P:1600.76 E:0.088303 |  What a chance as well, the penalty that they had
[5992.78 - 5995.78] P:1630.93 E:0.077885 |  Alfonso Davis having it saved by Courtois
[5995.78 - 5998.78] P:1726.03 E:0.059419 |  That was way back in the 11th minute
[5998.78 - 6000.78] P:1543.37 E:0.072471 |  And now one nail down
[6000.78 - 6004.78] P:1697.79 E:0.077547 |  How they will rue that if this is the final score
[6004.78 - 6007.78] P:1641.77 E:0.095546 |  But it's not over yet and Johnston crosses
[6007.78 - 6013.78] P:1836.70 E:0.094273 |  And there's the header from Larin that is saved by Courtois to his right
[6013.78 - 6015.78] P:1778.85 E:0.089290 |  And actually caught by him as well
[6015.78 - 6020.78] P:1721.74 E:0.093689 |  He's about 5 yards further out than the 18-yard box
[6020.78 - 6022.78] P:1847.31 E:0.089045 |  And he just crosses it
[6022.78 - 6024.78] P:1959.48 E:0.103767 |  He doesn't even look, just whips it into that area
[6024.78 - 6027.78] P:1806.52 E:0.091434 |  Just couldn't get enough on the header
[6027.78 - 6031.78] P:1555.48 E:0.081882 |  Larin, really difficult header
[6031.78 - 6033.78] P:1627.93 E:0.090288 |  But Courtois dealt with it
[6033.78 - 6036.78] P:1707.87 E:0.079148 |  Like the top-class goalkeeper he is
[6036.78 - 6038.78] P:1551.45 E:0.069239 |  When he's been called on tonight
[6038.78 - 6041.78] P:1734.09 E:0.064015 |  Courtois again has done his job
[6041.78 - 6043.78] P:1677.58 E:0.074426 |  That performance, I don't think I'll ever forget
[6043.78 - 6046.78] P:1628.47 E:0.084479 |  That goalkeeping performance in the Champions League final last season
[6046.78 - 6047.78] P:1295.02 E:0.089743 |  From another match
[6047.78 - 6048.78] P:1881.87 E:0.078821 |  And that's it for Buchanan
[6048.78 - 6050.78] P:1770.60 E:0.097506 |  Well, he's done well tonight
[6050.78 - 6055.78] P:1722.95 E:0.077614 |  And also coming off is Ostacchio
[6055.78 - 6058.78] P:1623.31 E:0.095281 |  So two of the star men have been taken off by John Herdman
[6058.78 - 6060.78] P:1631.93 E:0.091384 |  For the last 15 minutes
[6060.78 - 6065.78] P:1593.42 E:0.072593 |  Yeah, he's probably resting them, I would imagine
[6065.78 - 6068.78] P:1578.77 E:0.084586 |  He has Larin on the right-hand side
[6068.78 - 6069.78] P:1550.07 E:0.085964 |  Larin for Canada
[6069.78 - 6070.78] P:1586.33 E:0.083177 |  Now Davis
[6070.78 - 6072.78] P:1650.59 E:0.101153 |  And Davis hits a low ball into the area
[6072.78 - 6074.78] P:1737.41 E:0.091554 |  Poor contact door from Davis
[6074.78 - 6075.78] P:1715.99 E:0.096556 |  Easily cleared away
[6075.78 - 6077.78] P:1648.74 E:0.100103 |  And then there's a collision
[6077.78 - 6078.78] P:1600.93 E:0.102749 |  Trossard on Davis
[6078.78 - 6080.78] P:1629.44 E:0.090233 |  And that's a yellow card for that challenge
[6080.78 - 6081.78] P:1868.98 E:0.096819 |  Just stretching into it
[6081.78 - 6083.78] P:1560.45 E:0.090839 |  A little clumsy from Alfonso Davis
[6083.78 - 6084.78] P:1610.49 E:0.080196 |  Yellow card
[6084.78 - 6087.78] P:1575.75 E:0.092437 |  Yeah, I think he just caught Trossard high on the knee there
[6087.78 - 6089.78] P:1438.70 E:0.072570 |  Unintentional, to be honest with you
[6089.78 - 6092.78] P:1580.36 E:0.079889 |  But referees on the spot
[6092.78 - 6093.78] P:1653.00 E:0.051717 |  Trossard still down
[6093.78 - 6094.78] P:1018.95 E:0.086306 |  Maybe a painful one
[6094.78 - 6095.78] P:1666.43 E:0.087792 |  Yeah, just catches him on the ankle
[6095.78 - 6097.78] P:1518.12 E:0.054954 |  I think it was actually
[6097.78 - 6098.78] P:1429.34 E:0.092457 |  He's been good tonight
[6098.78 - 6100.78] P:1469.64 E:0.085296 |  I've enjoyed watching him play, Davis
[6100.78 - 6102.78] P:1540.97 E:0.079591 |  Very talented young man
[6102.78 - 6104.78] P:1486.28 E:0.087098 |  Played down the left, played down the middle
[6104.78 - 6105.78] P:1754.94 E:0.029906 |  Played anywhere
[6105.78 - 6108.78] P:1514.87 E:0.090638 |  Liam Miller has come on for Canada
[6108.78 - 6110.78] P:1661.17 E:0.094195 |  And also, as we said, Jonathan Asorio
[6110.78 - 6113.78] P:1406.20 E:0.088232 |  So Liam Miller, the former Liverpool youngster
[6113.78 - 6118.78] P:1682.41 E:0.077129 |  Who also played on loan for Kilmarnock and Charlton
[6118.78 - 6120.78] P:1536.29 E:0.090765 |  Just the one appearance for Liverpool
[6120.78 - 6122.78] P:1725.89 E:0.077260 |  In the FA Cup that Tygan Shrewsbury
[6122.78 - 6123.78] P:1508.01 E:0.063322 |  A couple of years ago
[6123.78 - 6126.78] P:1620.27 E:0.071543 |  So Liam Miller, the number 23
[6126.78 - 6132.78] P:1659.37 E:0.055321 |  Is on playing on the left-hand side
[6132.78 - 6133.78] P:1397.78 E:0.089861 |  There he is now
[6133.78 - 6135.78] P:1571.07 E:0.081282 |  Over on that flank of the field
[6135.78 - 6137.78] P:1730.84 E:0.071822 |  And actually concedes a free kick
[6137.78 - 6139.78] P:1708.51 E:0.078875 |  That's his first contribution to the game
[6139.78 - 6142.78] P:1664.15 E:0.085463 |  Now playing his football for Basel, by the way, in Switzerland
[6142.78 - 6145.78] P:1670.59 E:0.045855 |  So a free kick to Belgium
[6145.78 - 6147.78] P:1540.03 E:0.062656 |  Over there on the far side of the field
[6147.78 - 6150.78] P:1796.73 E:0.045064 |  I think one or two have been headed off
[6150.78 - 6153.78] P:1578.94 E:0.099064 |  As I say, we're a good half-hours drive away from
[6153.78 - 6156.78] P:1389.45 E:0.088636 |  Central Doha, where we're sitting here inside the stadium
[6156.78 - 6158.78] P:1536.47 E:0.081060 |  Davis now bringing the ball in field
[6158.78 - 6161.78] P:1642.00 E:0.091425 |  He's away from Whitzel, plays it to the edge of the area
[6161.78 - 6163.78] P:1601.87 E:0.081809 |  He went down looking for the return
[6163.78 - 6165.78] P:1653.88 E:0.075157 |  But he's back up on his feet again
[6165.78 - 6167.78] P:1723.79 E:0.096874 |  And now, Canada with the ball on the edge
[6167.78 - 6168.78] P:1724.50 E:0.098873 |  Of the penalty area
[6168.78 - 6170.78] P:1745.34 E:0.096085 |  Asorio it is into the action for the first time
[6170.78 - 6172.78] P:1422.52 E:0.078094 |  But plays it forward and there's nobody there in a white shirt
[6172.78 - 6173.78] P:1795.34 E:0.066674 |  For Canada
[6173.78 - 6176.78] P:1673.02 E:0.090579 |  The line of Belgian defenders are able to clear it away
[6176.78 - 6178.78] P:1764.66 E:0.096251 |  Miller now takes it up for Canada again
[6178.78 - 6180.78] P:1715.70 E:0.088292 |  Miller slips into the box
[6180.78 - 6181.78] P:1698.02 E:0.087962 |  It might bounce for Canada
[6181.78 - 6184.78] P:1616.83 E:0.069250 |  But it is cleared away
[6184.78 - 6187.78] P:1679.06 E:0.095251 |  Just inside the penalty area by Aldervireld
[6187.78 - 6189.78] P:1810.80 E:0.071884 |  Canada come again
[6189.78 - 6191.78] P:1620.57 E:0.100636 |  They're certainly not giving this up
[6191.78 - 6193.78] P:1666.86 E:0.089294 |  As you would expect, they wouldn't one-nil down
[6193.78 - 6195.78] P:1766.03 E:0.080558 |  But in fact, it is Appenda
[6195.78 - 6197.78] P:1712.42 E:0.112101 |  Who's able to carry the ball away downfield
[6197.78 - 6201.78] P:1793.02 E:0.079750 |  And Alistair Johnston puts in the challenge
[6201.78 - 6203.78] P:1785.75 E:0.106933 |  Which receives a yellow card
[6203.78 - 6205.78] P:1680.15 E:0.095626 |  He was nearly away Appenda
[6205.78 - 6207.78] P:1679.50 E:0.072234 |  And Johnston just brought him down
[6207.78 - 6209.78] P:1486.03 E:0.108314 |  Yeah, I think Appenda was away
[6209.78 - 6212.78] P:1607.83 E:0.078685 |  A bit of a toss-up of five yards, the two of them
[6212.78 - 6215.78] P:1644.45 E:0.084827 |  And yes, he's at Lunge
[6215.78 - 6217.78] P:1872.71 E:0.099322 |  Johnston is just getting out four
[6217.78 - 6219.78] P:1579.91 E:0.078584 |  He's getting out muscled and he's
[6219.78 - 6221.78] P:1092.44 E:0.086609 |  He's out to bring Appenda down there
[6221.78 - 6223.78] P:1293.20 E:0.113017 |  With a bit of a scissor tackle from behind
[6223.78 - 6226.78] P:1511.95 E:0.073119 |  I think he was looking to take on the last defender as well
[6226.78 - 6228.78] P:1671.14 E:0.036754 |  So yeah, you can see that one
[6230.78 - 6231.78] P:1820.21 E:0.085099 |  So it's a free kick
[6231.78 - 6234.78] P:1531.55 E:0.062606 |  And actually Appenda has stayed down there
[6234.78 - 6237.78] P:1686.45 E:0.065789 |  And is actually receiving treatment
[6240.78 - 6242.78] P:1691.71 E:0.088865 |  So the physios are there
[6242.78 - 6246.78] P:1542.25 E:0.077414 |  The medical people just making sure that everything's okay
[6246.78 - 6249.78] P:1668.12 E:0.062634 |  With Asorio, with Appenda
[6249.78 - 6254.78] P:1689.09 E:0.060561 |  Certainly Roberto Martinez wouldn't want an injury to Appenda
[6254.78 - 6257.78] P:1784.05 E:0.050249 |  We're just saying it again
[6257.78 - 6260.78] P:1617.56 E:0.074395 |  Dion, it was a bit of a reckless challenge
[6260.78 - 6262.78] P:1793.05 E:0.089279 |  Yeah, it's very reckless
[6262.78 - 6264.78] P:1502.32 E:0.094957 |  It's a definite lunge
[6264.78 - 6266.78] P:1744.43 E:0.091669 |  At the point, he is low with his feet
[6266.78 - 6269.78] P:1609.58 E:0.085821 |  Yes, he's low with his feet and Appenda's in the air as well
[6269.78 - 6273.78] P:1764.46 E:0.080515 |  So none of his studs or feet are in the ground
[6273.78 - 6275.78] P:1519.66 E:0.078678 |  So he's up in the air, so which is good
[6275.78 - 6277.78] P:1612.52 E:0.074563 |  It's quite a relief, wasn't it?
[6277.78 - 6278.78] P:1292.65 E:0.080019 |  Absolutely
[6278.78 - 6281.78] P:1622.11 E:0.084216 |  For him there, and also it was a similar sort of challenge
[6281.78 - 6283.78] P:1514.78 E:0.089001 |  To the one that was put in on Harry Kane the other night
[6283.78 - 6284.78] P:1679.00 E:0.085222 |  Which led to the concern
[6284.78 - 6285.78] P:1682.33 E:0.068001 |  Yeah, clumsy
[6285.78 - 6288.78] P:1581.61 E:0.079684 |  I have to say, we got wind of that very late last night
[6288.78 - 6292.78] P:1618.15 E:0.069798 |  And that very much put a bit of a dampener on things
[6292.78 - 6295.78] P:1669.62 E:0.077436 |  But it seems, certainly the talk today
[6295.78 - 6298.78] P:1656.03 E:0.081586 |  The reports today are that Harry Kane was involved with training
[6298.78 - 6301.78] P:1749.61 E:0.066817 |  For England, down at Al-Wakra
[6301.78 - 6303.78] P:1559.38 E:0.081908 |  So we'll learn more about that
[6303.78 - 6306.78] P:1568.43 E:0.086264 |  I'm talking to Gareth Southgate tomorrow afternoon there
[6306.78 - 6308.78] P:1646.26 E:0.079677 |  So we'll get chapter and verse
[6308.78 - 6310.78] P:1524.05 E:0.092129 |  And see how things are exactly
[6310.78 - 6312.78] P:1608.23 E:0.083193 |  So listen out for that on Five Life
[6312.78 - 6314.78] P:1675.50 E:0.094712 |  Free kick though, that is played in by Tabrna
[6314.78 - 6317.78] P:1719.29 E:0.070296 |  But headed up and over the top of the crossbar
[6317.78 - 6321.78] P:1815.92 E:0.057189 |  By Dendonka, on the edge of the six yard box
[6321.78 - 6323.78] P:1890.21 E:0.086320 |  Yeah, good chat, just reaching
[6323.78 - 6325.78] P:1794.52 E:0.084934 |  Couldn't get high enough, couldn't get over it
[6325.78 - 6328.78] P:1618.01 E:0.060093 |  Always, always going over
[6328.78 - 6332.78] P:1844.27 E:0.042711 |  Another great ball in there from Kevin Dabrna
[6332.78 - 6338.78] P:1811.91 E:0.053173 |  So we have five minutes, just over five minutes to play
[6338.78 - 6341.78] P:1635.20 E:0.080106 |  Plus at a time, Belgium still leading Canada
[6341.78 - 6342.78] P:1436.97 E:0.078342 |  By one goal to nil
[6342.78 - 6344.78] P:1514.54 E:0.088510 |  And here's Kevin Dabrna, turns again
[6344.78 - 6346.78] P:1706.66 E:0.107611 |  And sets off on a run, a direct run to the edge of the day
[6346.78 - 6349.78] P:1670.82 E:0.079930 |  And goes for goal, but got right underneath the shot
[6349.78 - 6353.78] P:1777.37 E:0.081897 |  And lofted it high over the angle of post and bar
[6353.78 - 6354.78] P:1546.11 E:0.087357 |  Into the crowd
[6354.78 - 6356.78] P:1629.29 E:0.085659 |  And Canada have got the ball back very quickly
[6356.78 - 6358.78] P:1745.01 E:0.086994 |  And are already off downfield
[6358.78 - 6360.78] P:1778.40 E:0.070672 |  Having taken a very quick goal kick
[6360.78 - 6364.78] P:1764.95 E:0.065460 |  And in centre field, Kone turns
[6364.78 - 6366.78] P:1807.16 E:0.055798 |  Didn't have too many options
[6366.78 - 6368.78] P:1538.00 E:0.074959 |  So the momentum of that has been somewhat slowed
[6368.78 - 6371.78] P:1612.93 E:0.052797 |  At a Kube though, is able to get it down
[6371.78 - 6375.78] P:1623.50 E:0.075338 |  Osorio now, Osorio back to At a Kube
[6375.78 - 6377.78] P:1615.25 E:0.081029 |  Time beginning to run out for Canada
[6377.78 - 6379.78] P:1797.54 E:0.101006 |  Good looking, cross though, but Larry in the middle
[6379.78 - 6382.78] P:1800.17 E:0.095324 |  It was slightly behind him, he had to readjust
[6382.78 - 6385.78] P:1725.26 E:0.077870 |  And just ended up off balance, ballooning it
[6385.78 - 6386.78] P:1488.13 E:0.078476 |  High over the top
[6386.78 - 6389.78] P:1585.12 E:0.107777 |  I don't know whether to say they've been unlucky
[6389.78 - 6391.78] P:1532.39 E:0.096493 |  Or the quality's not been there
[6391.78 - 6394.78] P:1373.91 E:0.090169 |  I mean, some of the chances that they've had in the final
[6394.78 - 6396.78] P:1721.83 E:0.088611 |  That was a difficult one actually
[6396.78 - 6399.78] P:1806.50 E:0.085767 |  For Larry, the ball was slightly too high for him
[6399.78 - 6402.78] P:1708.95 E:0.052525 |  He couldn't get it down, he couldn't get over it
[6402.78 - 6405.78] P:1445.05 E:0.085875 |  But they've just got themselves into some really good positions
[6405.78 - 6407.78] P:1226.54 E:0.104167 |  They've played well tonight, they really have
[6407.78 - 6410.78] P:1743.51 E:0.069674 |  They just need to work on that
[6412.78 - 6414.78] P:1698.18 E:0.083849 |  That's Dion Dublin, this is Five Live
[6414.78 - 6417.78] P:1434.98 E:0.080067 |  And BBC sounds, be all up and running again
[6417.78 - 6419.78] P:1624.23 E:0.079246 |  At breakfast tomorrow morning with Rick Edwards
[6419.78 - 6421.78] P:1643.28 E:0.077474 |  Who's here with us in Qatar
[6421.78 - 6424.78] P:1624.96 E:0.080235 |  So from six o'clock, Five Live Breakfast at the World Cup
[6424.78 - 6426.78] P:1691.33 E:0.072067 |  I don't know if the Borebal Challenge will be back
[6426.78 - 6428.78] P:1505.66 E:0.085800 |  In operation tomorrow, have you done that yet Dion?
[6428.78 - 6430.78] P:1523.23 E:0.083387 |  Or have you managed to successfully avoid it?
[6430.78 - 6431.78] P:1596.12 E:0.078356 |  I think I've avoided that
[6431.78 - 6432.78] P:1633.49 E:0.088742 |  Have you? Do you want it? Well done
[6432.78 - 6434.78] P:1282.72 E:0.085114 |  Yes, I'm hoping to do the same myself
[6434.78 - 6437.78] P:1717.18 E:0.088364 |  Castaner heading it forward towards De Bruyne
[6437.78 - 6440.78] P:1729.53 E:0.096026 |  And De Bruyne now finds the ball to the edge of the area
[6440.78 - 6442.78] P:1802.52 E:0.104031 |  La Trossade, and Trossade now takes it
[6442.78 - 6445.78] P:1680.95 E:0.084035 |  Towards the dead ball line and overruns it in the end
[6446.78 - 6449.78] P:1768.53 E:0.091729 |  And it is a good kick, and it comes to nothing
[6449.78 - 6451.78] P:1641.86 E:0.098216 |  Not clicking for Belgium
[6451.78 - 6453.78] P:1633.18 E:0.080856 |  Not at the moment, it's not
[6453.78 - 6455.78] P:1685.99 E:0.092762 |  They've created some good half chances
[6455.78 - 6458.78] P:1684.26 E:0.077845 |  But Canada have stood firm, they've worked really hard
[6458.78 - 6461.78] P:1721.50 E:0.074640 |  Not a cramp out there now for the Canadian players
[6461.78 - 6463.78] P:1645.54 E:0.073040 |  They've worked so hard
[6463.78 - 6466.78] P:1709.86 E:0.084265 |  And this falls into the category of unconvincing
[6466.78 - 6468.78] P:1669.31 E:0.099086 |  Opening victory for Belgium
[6468.78 - 6470.78] P:1638.38 E:0.103162 |  Yes, I would say so
[6470.78 - 6473.78] P:1666.96 E:0.091592 |  I really want to say that they've managed the game well
[6473.78 - 6475.78] P:1757.34 E:0.091353 |  But they haven't been in total control of this game
[6475.78 - 6478.78] P:1661.22 E:0.082124 |  In order to call it good game management
[6478.78 - 6481.78] P:1698.35 E:0.075181 |  Just getting over the line, in my opinion
[6481.78 - 6486.78] P:1720.60 E:0.067879 |  Reaching into the book of cliched stereotypes
[6486.78 - 6491.78] P:1685.79 E:0.064800 |  It's also going to be a plucky opening defeat for Canada
[6491.78 - 6492.78] P:1507.84 E:0.092773 |  Or is it?
[6492.78 - 6494.78] P:1624.51 E:0.106875 |  As the ball bounces into the penalty area
[6494.78 - 6496.78] P:1660.75 E:0.092408 |  And Larrant was almost in
[6496.78 - 6499.78] P:1799.63 E:0.106548 |  But it just got away from him again at the crucial moment
[6499.78 - 6504.78] P:1775.17 E:0.075774 |  And across came Jan Fertongen to plant it out of play
[6504.78 - 6506.78] P:1674.62 E:0.100243 |  Yeah, just there were all three of them were there
[6506.78 - 6508.78] P:1475.74 E:0.084119 |  Davis was there, Lavin was there
[6508.78 - 6510.78] P:1735.12 E:0.087087 |  David was there as well
[6510.78 - 6513.78] P:1550.50 E:0.092877 |  The three of them, little over, ricocheted off a few defenders' legs
[6513.78 - 6517.78] P:1759.44 E:0.075396 |  And landed to a Belgium player yet again
[6517.78 - 6520.78] P:1679.84 E:0.059785 |  The silent giants being too silent
[6520.78 - 6523.78] P:1773.33 E:0.084958 |  They wanted to turn up the volume
[6523.78 - 6525.78] P:1872.57 E:0.102637 |  But they've lost possession, Asorio
[6525.78 - 6530.78] P:1773.87 E:0.054486 |  And so Belgium, long, long crossfield pass
[6530.78 - 6534.78] P:1791.71 E:0.066563 |  Which is headed back and down by David
[6534.78 - 6536.78] P:1721.52 E:0.092623 |  And now Davis takes it on through the middle
[6536.78 - 6540.78] P:1560.06 E:0.080126 |  Alfonso Davis, I've lost count now of the number of different positions
[6540.78 - 6542.78] P:1512.59 E:0.088133 |  Alfonso Davis has played in
[6542.78 - 6545.78] P:1754.70 E:0.076863 |  He's the heartbeat of this team
[6545.78 - 6546.78] P:1433.22 E:0.097561 |  He holds off Whitzel
[6546.78 - 6549.78] P:1742.78 E:0.087156 |  And he plays it to Miller on the left hand side
[6549.78 - 6551.78] P:1645.43 E:0.085134 |  And Miller with the right-footed cross
[6551.78 - 6555.78] P:1712.50 E:0.062104 |  And that's headed away though by Aldervirald in the middle
[6555.78 - 6559.78] P:1786.79 E:0.078621 |  And Canada have to start again from the halfway line
[6559.78 - 6562.78] P:1833.37 E:0.061597 |  I think they're going to run out of time
[6562.78 - 6566.78] P:1744.64 E:0.054016 |  We're in the 88th minute
[6566.78 - 6567.78] P:1696.94 E:0.090243 |  There's one more chance, John
[6567.78 - 6568.78] P:1657.90 E:0.062534 |  There's one more chance
[6568.78 - 6572.78] P:1748.50 E:0.089326 |  Let's see, here is Atacubi taking it on towards the dead ball line
[6572.78 - 6575.78] P:1841.16 E:0.094731 |  And winning a corner, it's a corner for Canada
[6575.78 - 6577.78] P:1714.68 E:0.098407 |  And it's at that end
[6577.78 - 6581.78] P:1804.57 E:0.102368 |  And of course, Canadian Maple Leaf flags are being waved again
[6581.78 - 6585.78] P:1753.27 E:0.092416 |  And now there are people down there dressed as Mounties as well
[6585.78 - 6588.78] P:1846.35 E:0.078402 |  Of course there are, there had to be
[6588.78 - 6592.78] P:1830.78 E:0.094609 |  And it's a corner that will be played in from the left hand side
[6592.78 - 6595.78] P:1911.87 E:0.091751 |  For Canada, this could be the final chance
[6595.78 - 6598.78] P:1824.66 E:0.094545 |  Who knows, and it goes, oh it's wasted
[6598.78 - 6602.78] P:1694.06 E:0.095304 |  It is utterly wasted, it's ballooned across from the left hand side
[6602.78 - 6604.78] P:1605.77 E:0.093916 |  Over everyone inside the box
[6604.78 - 6606.78] P:1612.00 E:0.079219 |  Whether they were in red or white, and it's a goal kick
[6606.78 - 6608.78] P:1713.46 E:0.106500 |  That's where you need a little bit of care
[6608.78 - 6611.78] P:1728.59 E:0.094251 |  And you just make sure the ball ends up in the heart
[6611.78 - 6613.78] P:1637.58 E:0.084130 |  Of that Belgium penalty area
[6613.78 - 6615.78] P:1713.36 E:0.095755 |  And he just puts too much on it
[6615.78 - 6618.78] P:1732.64 E:0.079100 |  Harmlessly goes out for a goal kick
[6618.78 - 6619.78] P:1558.30 E:0.080055 |  What a waste that is
[6619.78 - 6624.78] P:1718.08 E:0.075520 |  So looking down there to see the fourth official
[6624.78 - 6626.78] P:1728.33 E:0.076828 |  The Japanese fourth official
[6626.78 - 6628.78] P:1702.00 E:0.078525 |  Can't see the board yet
[6628.78 - 6631.78] P:1557.86 E:0.075357 |  But the 90 minutes are almost up
[6631.78 - 6635.78] P:1517.92 E:0.073314 |  Belgium leading Canada by one goal to nil
[6635.78 - 6639.78] P:1704.02 E:0.069588 |  As Belgium actually come forward with Murnier
[6639.78 - 6641.78] P:1583.37 E:0.097658 |  Just outside the area on his right foot
[6641.78 - 6643.78] P:1642.01 E:0.082700 |  Curled a shot with the outside of his boot
[6643.78 - 6645.78] P:1573.97 E:0.096735 |  It hit Victoria who was falling over at the time
[6645.78 - 6647.78] P:1749.07 E:0.079018 |  And bounces away wide
[6647.78 - 6649.78] P:1639.11 E:0.092752 |  And it is five minutes of added time
[6649.78 - 6653.78] P:1734.99 E:0.050996 |  Belgium have got five minutes
[6653.78 - 6657.78] P:1614.12 E:0.078219 |  Before they can record yet another opening win
[6657.78 - 6658.78] P:1692.35 E:0.066723 |  At a World Cup
[6658.78 - 6661.78] P:1653.32 E:0.083575 |  But actually this would equal the World Cup record
[6661.78 - 6665.78] P:1659.69 E:0.076579 |  Of eight consecutive World Cup group wins
[6665.78 - 6669.78] P:1532.90 E:0.085633 |  If they are able to see it out
[6669.78 - 6671.78] P:1678.55 E:0.092713 |  And at the moment they have got a corner
[6671.78 - 6673.78] P:1473.07 E:0.098865 |  So they are down the right end of the field
[6673.78 - 6675.78] P:1619.80 E:0.054900 |  To do just that
[6675.78 - 6677.78] P:1624.14 E:0.069254 |  Kevin De Bruyne over there
[6677.78 - 6680.78] P:1711.92 E:0.074542 |  Just lifts the ball up with the top of his foot
[6680.78 - 6682.78] P:1658.21 E:0.080976 |  Then puts it back in the quadrant
[6682.78 - 6684.78] P:1674.43 E:0.068341 |  Trossard makes a run over there
[6684.78 - 6686.78] P:1712.58 E:0.086334 |  Belgium looking to take this short
[6686.78 - 6687.78] P:1615.99 E:0.067292 |  Which they do
[6687.78 - 6688.78] P:1515.04 E:0.102139 |  And De Bruyne then receives it back
[6688.78 - 6689.78] P:1525.81 E:0.107511 |  And he is into the area
[6689.78 - 6691.78] P:1792.04 E:0.074509 |  And he shoots I think from a very tight angle
[6691.78 - 6693.78] P:1648.91 E:0.082087 |  But straight at goalkeeper Bojan
[6693.78 - 6695.78] P:1638.75 E:0.083479 |  Who is able to go down quite easily
[6695.78 - 6696.78] P:1380.69 E:0.092243 |  And hold it
[6696.78 - 6699.78] P:1457.74 E:0.090740 |  And then over arms it out here to the right hand side
[6699.78 - 6701.78] P:1659.59 E:0.074734 |  To Adakubi the left back
[6701.78 - 6703.78] P:1605.80 E:0.071647 |  Who is appearing now on the right wing
[6703.78 - 6705.78] P:1683.82 E:0.062018 |  Now in centre field
[6705.78 - 6707.78] P:1711.51 E:0.072134 |  Johnston plays it to Asorio
[6707.78 - 6709.78] P:1657.79 E:0.070855 |  Asorio just drifts away
[6709.78 - 6710.78] P:1850.91 E:0.088807 |  Keeps possession
[6710.78 - 6712.78] P:1672.51 E:0.089302 |  Still going Asorio
[6712.78 - 6714.78] P:1686.93 E:0.069917 |  Little pass forward to Corne
[6714.78 - 6716.78] P:1614.54 E:0.101305 |  Corne now to Alastair Johnson on the right hand side
[6716.78 - 6718.78] P:1668.26 E:0.090344 |  He puts his foot on the ball actually
[6718.78 - 6720.78] P:1627.76 E:0.090939 |  And Johnston crosses and it's deflected
[6720.78 - 6722.78] P:1595.96 E:0.088302 |  And Larin gets a header on it
[6722.78 - 6724.78] P:1667.37 E:0.092037 |  But he was impeded by Dendonka
[6724.78 - 6725.78] P:1813.01 E:0.076107 |  Who was in his way
[6725.78 - 6727.78] P:1553.00 E:0.099840 |  And he headed actually into the defender
[6727.78 - 6728.78] P:1541.29 E:0.080995 |  Looped up in the air
[6728.78 - 6730.78] P:1690.41 E:0.100341 |  And Courtois was able to make the catch
[6730.78 - 6731.78] P:1606.67 E:0.099870 |  Yes one of those catches
[6731.78 - 6732.78] P:1385.37 E:0.088430 |  They hold it for a couple of seconds
[6732.78 - 6734.78] P:1624.60 E:0.094059 |  And they fall on their elbows
[6734.78 - 6736.78] P:1609.90 E:0.057372 |  Kilowitter time
[6736.78 - 6738.78] P:1622.77 E:0.088749 |  Belgium I think will want this game
[6738.78 - 6740.78] P:1543.00 E:0.101179 |  Dunlund does today at ASAP
[6740.78 - 6742.78] P:1520.77 E:0.041343 |  They know they can play better than this
[6742.78 - 6744.78] P:1620.24 E:0.051925 |  Yeah this
[6744.78 - 6746.78] P:1583.00 E:0.078761 |  Has not done anything to
[6746.78 - 6748.78] P:1726.55 E:0.085397 |  Johnston company who I spoke to him earlier
[6748.78 - 6750.78] P:1806.84 E:0.063209 |  Described Belgium
[6750.78 - 6752.78] P:1657.66 E:0.072289 |  In terms of contenders to win this
[6752.78 - 6754.78] P:1506.13 E:0.089460 |  He said they're one of the outsiders
[6754.78 - 6756.78] P:1620.00 E:0.078855 |  Belgium and they've done nothing tonight
[6756.78 - 6758.78] P:1550.37 E:0.046040 |  To dispel that
[6758.78 - 6760.78] P:1702.08 E:0.087807 |  They will have to get better
[6760.78 - 6761.78] P:1736.03 E:0.068816 |  But of course in a tournament
[6761.78 - 6763.78] P:1615.27 E:0.091922 |  You can grow into a tournament
[6763.78 - 6765.78] P:1505.09 E:0.071960 |  And sometimes a disappointing start
[6765.78 - 6767.78] P:1505.84 E:0.088500 |  Is not the worst thing
[6767.78 - 6769.78] P:1686.43 E:0.083744 |  If you actually win the game
[6769.78 - 6770.78] P:1751.38 E:0.075071 |  But here's Miller
[6770.78 - 6771.78] P:1580.32 E:0.098438 |  Into the penalty area
[6771.78 - 6773.78] P:1602.98 E:0.074669 |  But his ball across is poor really
[6773.78 - 6775.78] P:1643.70 E:0.095804 |  Easily cleared away by Murnier
[6775.78 - 6777.78] P:1566.76 E:0.095858 |  And now Trossard has some space
[6777.78 - 6778.78] P:1582.11 E:0.068221 |  On the left hand side
[6778.78 - 6780.78] P:1707.61 E:0.067481 |  Trossard runs
[6780.78 - 6782.78] P:1530.71 E:0.097984 |  Just in front of where his manager Roberto Martinez
[6782.78 - 6784.78] P:1299.61 E:0.071651 |  Is standing there
[6784.78 - 6786.78] P:1533.21 E:0.071543 |  And then passes it back to De Bruyne
[6786.78 - 6788.78] P:1678.05 E:0.071874 |  And he has Witzel centrally
[6788.78 - 6790.78] P:1479.82 E:0.065906 |  Witzel back to a Nanna in the centre circle
[6790.78 - 6792.78] P:1575.79 E:0.068929 |  And the Everton man
[6792.78 - 6794.78] P:1602.13 E:0.096370 |  Exchanges passes with the Aston Villa man
[6794.78 - 6796.78] P:1652.15 E:0.065914 |  Then Donka
[6796.78 - 6798.78] P:1710.16 E:0.098533 |  And then here are the two old Tottenham boys
[6798.78 - 6800.78] P:1724.01 E:0.065140 |  Alderweirald and Fertonghen
[6800.78 - 6802.78] P:1770.59 E:0.056364 |  With it on the edge of the penalty area
[6803.78 - 6805.78] P:1813.10 E:0.060456 |  I mean if it stays like this
[6805.78 - 6806.78] P:1417.90 E:0.108148 |  It will be a clean sheet
[6806.78 - 6808.78] P:1706.41 E:0.084065 |  So they'll take the positives from that
[6808.78 - 6810.78] P:1708.08 E:0.082528 |  But it could easily not have been
[6810.78 - 6812.78] P:1586.35 E:0.097526 |  Yeah it's the only time in the game
[6812.78 - 6814.78] P:1605.72 E:0.083977 |  Where Belgium have had total control
[6814.78 - 6815.78] P:1831.02 E:0.106457 |  Right now
[6815.78 - 6816.78] P:1548.63 E:0.090629 |  The last couple of minutes
[6816.78 - 6817.78] P:1649.86 E:0.091742 |  Where they've just passed it about
[6817.78 - 6818.78] P:1873.08 E:0.085378 |  They've kept it
[6818.78 - 6819.78] P:1737.92 E:0.105391 |  Kevin De Bruyne is in charge
[6819.78 - 6820.78] P:1728.82 E:0.102197 |  And he's pointing
[6820.78 - 6821.78] P:1577.07 E:0.104870 |  He's telling everybody where to go
[6821.78 - 6823.78] P:1809.68 E:0.078315 |  But they haven't had it easy tonight
[6823.78 - 6824.78] P:1318.16 E:0.110251 |  Belgium not at all
[6824.78 - 6825.78] P:1695.98 E:0.072801 |  They're about to work really hard
[6825.78 - 6826.78] P:1275.20 E:0.099932 |  To get their goal
[6826.78 - 6829.78] P:1705.35 E:0.079379 |  We've now had three minutes of the five
[6829.78 - 6831.78] P:1723.97 E:0.062836 |  And Appenda is under the ball
[6831.78 - 6833.78] P:1696.08 E:0.082938 |  He's thinking about a shot from 25 yards
[6833.78 - 6835.78] P:1703.35 E:0.074543 |  But he actually in the end
[6835.78 - 6837.78] P:1749.54 E:0.058691 |  Came under pressure so played it back
[6837.78 - 6840.78] P:1658.74 E:0.058726 |  And it finds its way to Castaña
[6840.78 - 6841.78] P:1652.90 E:0.067721 |  On the left hand side
[6841.78 - 6842.78] P:1530.64 E:0.089592 |  Started as the right wing back
[6842.78 - 6844.78] P:1567.13 E:0.082389 |  Second half left wing back
[6844.78 - 6845.78] P:1509.11 E:0.090593 |  De Bruyne that's nice from him
[6845.78 - 6846.78] P:1833.87 E:0.092348 |  On the edge of the box
[6846.78 - 6848.78] P:1766.54 E:0.075639 |  Appenda is then challenged
[6848.78 - 6850.78] P:1602.84 E:0.086208 |  And the ball bounces back to goalkeeper Bojan
[6850.78 - 6852.78] P:1796.28 E:0.062301 |  So Canada need to go direct
[6852.78 - 6854.78] P:1712.99 E:0.101239 |  And they do from the goalkeeper
[6854.78 - 6856.78] P:1711.29 E:0.091929 |  This is a long one for Larin to chase
[6856.78 - 6857.78] P:1718.26 E:0.075475 |  But he won't reach that
[6857.78 - 6859.78] P:1618.35 E:0.058235 |  It's through bouncing onto the chest of Couretois
[6860.78 - 6862.78] P:1674.97 E:0.076268 |  Who's able to chest it down
[6862.78 - 6863.78] P:1493.01 E:0.079452 |  And now eventually picks it up
[6863.78 - 6865.78] P:1704.66 E:0.071989 |  And then just tosses it
[6865.78 - 6869.78] P:1616.32 E:0.078978 |  Almost basketball style to the left hand side
[6869.78 - 6871.78] P:1649.90 E:0.062087 |  Castaña whips it in field
[6871.78 - 6872.78] P:1589.16 E:0.087447 |  De Bruyne is there
[6872.78 - 6874.78] P:1511.98 E:0.087003 |  He lifted back to Castaña
[6874.78 - 6875.78] P:1394.71 E:0.085088 |  Who passes it forward to Trossard
[6875.78 - 6878.78] P:1697.77 E:0.077487 |  And Trossard is tackled successfully
[6878.78 - 6880.78] P:1772.71 E:0.078122 |  By Camal Miller
[6880.78 - 6881.78] P:1565.30 E:0.088010 |  Who has then gone down
[6881.78 - 6883.78] P:1571.61 E:0.083021 |  And I think that's a bit of cramp as well
[6883.78 - 6884.78] P:1641.12 E:0.090073 |  From the big central defender
[6884.78 - 6885.78] P:1349.64 E:0.083652 |  Yeah he's stretching there
[6885.78 - 6886.78] P:1713.30 E:0.092808 |  Played well tonight
[6886.78 - 6887.78] P:1652.34 E:0.092676 |  Miller really well
[6887.78 - 6888.78] P:1478.50 E:0.088924 |  In fact they've played well
[6888.78 - 6890.78] P:1456.35 E:0.074966 |  Defensively
[6890.78 - 6891.78] P:1802.10 E:0.024538 |  Canada tonight
[6891.78 - 6892.78] P:1595.52 E:0.109741 |  He stayed down
[6892.78 - 6893.78] P:1814.69 E:0.092891 |  He's just
[6893.78 - 6895.78] P:1576.50 E:0.062089 |  He's out of the Wes Morgan's
[6895.78 - 6896.78] P:1487.07 E:0.064014 |  Yes he is
[6896.78 - 6897.78] P:1444.93 E:0.112981 |  He's a build of central defender
[6897.78 - 6898.78] P:1592.09 E:0.098297 |  Absolutely right
[6898.78 - 6899.78] P:1254.96 E:0.084218 |  Yes he is
[6899.78 - 6900.78] P:1421.97 E:0.066464 |  Whole hearted defender
[6900.78 - 6901.78] P:1651.73 E:0.082879 |  Big chest
[6901.78 - 6902.78] P:1855.79 E:0.072398 |  Yeah big chest
[6902.78 - 6904.78] P:1783.74 E:0.066212 |  Strong, powerful
[6904.78 - 6906.78] P:1712.50 E:0.103359 |  Imposing, worked really hard
[6906.78 - 6908.78] P:1669.66 E:0.070877 |  Powerful run up
[6908.78 - 6911.78] P:1727.76 E:0.060539 |  Sweat dripping off his brow
[6911.78 - 6912.78] P:1500.51 E:0.077051 |  Worked really hard tonight
[6912.78 - 6914.78] P:1579.63 E:0.076177 |  Throw into Belgium
[6915.78 - 6919.78] P:1719.61 E:0.073555 |  We have 30 seconds of the 5 minutes to play
[6919.78 - 6921.78] P:1660.47 E:0.082588 |  So it's got to be now for Canada
[6921.78 - 6922.78] P:1641.60 E:0.089985 |  It's got to be this move
[6922.78 - 6924.78] P:1696.67 E:0.071546 |  Golkiba catches it from
[6924.78 - 6925.78] P:1613.94 E:0.094408 |  Appendaz Kross from the left hand side
[6925.78 - 6927.78] P:1653.71 E:0.084659 |  Munder arms it out
[6927.78 - 6928.78] P:1809.57 E:0.083533 |  And now Atacubi
[6928.78 - 6930.78] P:1673.39 E:0.086366 |  Atacubi to Osorio
[6930.78 - 6931.78] P:1611.38 E:0.052185 |  Belgium have dropped back
[6931.78 - 6932.78] P:1595.73 E:0.106816 |  Everyone apart from Appendaz
[6932.78 - 6934.78] P:1712.45 E:0.086150 |  Drop back into position here
[6934.78 - 6935.78] P:1388.67 E:0.082094 |  And they're allowing Osorio
[6935.78 - 6937.78] P:1622.02 E:0.096324 |  To carry the ball forward
[6937.78 - 6938.78] P:1679.65 E:0.080802 |  It's got to find a way past
[6938.78 - 6939.78] P:1718.20 E:0.071169 |  All of this red and black
[6939.78 - 6940.78] P:1570.25 E:0.088304 |  And that is it
[6940.78 - 6942.78] P:1637.66 E:0.114271 |  The whistle goes
[6942.78 - 6943.78] P:1818.43 E:0.082171 |  I'll make that a little short
[6943.78 - 6945.78] P:1832.10 E:0.096228 |  Of the 5 minutes
[6945.78 - 6946.78] P:1739.48 E:0.092208 |  Of added time
[6946.78 - 6948.78] P:1785.48 E:0.089432 |  From this referee
[6948.78 - 6950.78] P:1755.72 E:0.105572 |  Who is not averse to blowing early
[6950.78 - 6952.78] P:1824.43 E:0.080233 |  However, that is it
[6952.78 - 6953.78] P:1654.84 E:0.080315 |  That is the final whistle
[6953.78 - 6955.78] P:1620.27 E:0.100475 |  And that is a hard fought
[6955.78 - 6957.78] P:1751.44 E:0.076710 |  Opening win for Belgium
[6957.78 - 6958.78] P:1740.39 E:0.084960 |  And actually you can tell that
[6958.78 - 6960.78] P:1820.51 E:0.098972 |  From the reaction of their players
[6960.78 - 6961.78] P:1841.96 E:0.077016 |  Who look mighty relieved
[6961.78 - 6962.78] P:1950.75 E:0.106315 |  That they've got out of this
[6962.78 - 6964.78] P:1647.13 E:0.093144 |  With 3 points from their first match
[6964.78 - 6966.78] P:1737.92 E:0.090125 |  And for Canada
[6966.78 - 6967.78] P:1833.58 E:0.046723 |  Disappointment
[6967.78 - 6969.78] P:1663.57 E:0.090754 |  The missed penalty early in the match
[6969.78 - 6971.78] P:1790.91 E:0.097025 |  The opportunity to score their first goal
[6971.78 - 6972.78] P:1816.68 E:0.104827 |  At the World Cup
[6972.78 - 6974.78] P:1686.03 E:0.089181 |  That was not taken by Alfonso Davis
[6974.78 - 6976.78] P:1535.19 E:0.091462 |  A disappointing penalty
[6976.78 - 6977.78] P:1672.51 E:0.065247 |  That was comfortably saved
[6977.78 - 6979.78] P:1706.62 E:0.097885 |  By Courtois down to his right
[6979.78 - 6981.78] P:1790.99 E:0.093104 |  So they are still looking
[6981.78 - 6982.78] P:1704.56 E:0.080650 |  For that first point
[6982.78 - 6984.78] P:1848.49 E:0.083450 |  And first goal at a World Cup
[6984.78 - 6986.78] P:1762.14 E:0.088321 |  Belgium have won it 1-0
[6986.78 - 6987.78] P:1805.47 E:0.055463 |  Dion?
[6987.78 - 6989.78] P:1842.29 E:0.084998 |  Yeah, I'm convinced by them
[6989.78 - 6990.78] P:1350.35 E:0.109413 |  At the moment
[6990.78 - 6991.78] P:1767.23 E:0.080915 |  Belgium they were OK tonight
[6991.78 - 6993.78] P:1738.65 E:0.100228 |  They just got over the line
[6993.78 - 6995.78] P:1730.35 E:0.086823 |  Yes, we know they have the quality
[6995.78 - 6996.78] P:1673.08 E:0.067502 |  Just can't get enough
[6996.78 - 6998.78] P:1607.25 E:0.088577 |  Oh, very clever John
[6998.78 - 6999.78] P:1703.22 E:0.076275 |  Just can't get enough
[6999.78 - 7000.78] P:1283.55 E:0.093370 |  That's the song playing in the background
[7000.78 - 7001.78] P:1279.13 E:0.086264 |  If you can't hear it
[7001.78 - 7003.78] P:1870.58 E:0.083336 |  Canada very impressed with them
[7003.78 - 7005.78] P:1732.34 E:0.086605 |  Worked really hard for 70%
[7005.78 - 7006.78] P:1691.16 E:0.080815 |  Of this game
[7006.78 - 7007.78] P:1438.54 E:0.111767 |  They were in it
[7007.78 - 7009.78] P:1852.70 E:0.086454 |  They created lots of chances
[7009.78 - 7010.78] P:1515.57 E:0.117194 |  They were very unlucky
[7010.78 - 7011.78] P:1767.07 E:0.077164 |  In front of goal
[7011.78 - 7012.78] P:1624.59 E:0.094733 |  I've got to say
[7012.78 - 7013.78] P:1917.86 E:0.094542 |  In regards to Ricochet
[7013.78 - 7014.78] P:2039.48 E:0.086164 |  He's off the shins
[7014.78 - 7017.78] P:1776.11 E:0.097532 |  They all fell to a Belgium red shirt
[7017.78 - 7019.78] P:1820.81 E:0.071726 |  But when they did have their chances
[7019.78 - 7020.78] P:1984.03 E:0.087996 |  They just snatched at them
[7020.78 - 7022.78] P:1589.70 E:0.083087 |  They didn't have the coolness of mind
[7022.78 - 7024.78] P:1719.86 E:0.092398 |  To hit the target and work
[7024.78 - 7026.78] P:1850.35 E:0.086684 |  Courtois, the quality showed
[7026.78 - 7027.78] P:1187.47 E:0.098204 |  They were unlucky Canada
[7027.78 - 7030.78] P:1664.56 E:0.078218 |  Belgium just, just deserved it
[7030.78 - 7031.78] P:1403.00 E:0.057815 |  So there we are
[7031.78 - 7032.78] P:1585.49 E:0.111798 |  Just the one goal so far
[7032.78 - 7033.78] P:1712.79 E:0.102212 |  In this group
[7033.78 - 7035.78] P:1577.92 E:0.097991 |  Morocco-Nil, Croatia-Nil
[7035.78 - 7036.78] P:1742.10 E:0.074724 |  In the first match today
[7036.78 - 7038.78] P:1700.63 E:0.082575 |  And now Belgium 1
[7038.78 - 7041.78] P:1768.47 E:0.084483 |  Canada-Nil is the final score
[7041.78 - 7044.78] P:1764.24 E:0.071922 |  Here at the Ahmed bin Ali
[7044.78 - 7046.78] P:1718.58 E:0.091106 |  Do you know what you've both said it
[7046.78 - 7047.78] P:1765.31 E:0.103496 |  John Murray and Dion Dublin
[7047.78 - 7049.78] P:1695.37 E:0.089680 |  At the stadium four is this evening
[7049.78 - 7050.78] P:1649.03 E:0.095177 |  You've both said it
[7050.78 - 7051.78] P:1851.25 E:0.079113 |  And there was a kind of
[7051.78 - 7053.78] P:1566.73 E:0.108092 |  Underwhelming 1-0 victory
[7053.78 - 7054.78] P:1858.61 E:0.084468 |  For Belgium this one
[7054.78 - 7056.78] P:1870.59 E:0.084523 |  But for Canada
[7056.78 - 7059.78] P:1808.60 E:0.084268 |  This feels like a World Cup
[7059.78 - 7061.78] P:1761.42 E:0.090372 |  That they might not qualify
[7061.78 - 7062.78] P:1621.56 E:0.087555 |  From the group
[7062.78 - 7063.78] P:1866.11 E:0.096939 |  But there's certainly going to be
[7063.78 - 7064.78] P:1649.73 E:0.080815 |  Some performances in there
[7064.78 - 7066.78] P:1802.92 E:0.102345 |  That are going to be really enjoyable
[7066.78 - 7069.78] P:1657.12 E:0.074645 |  They faded a bit towards the end though, didn't they?
[7069.78 - 7071.78] P:1577.30 E:0.087968 |  Yeah, listen, I think
[7071.78 - 7072.78] P:1616.08 E:0.100497 |  I think Vittorio and Johnston
[7072.78 - 7073.78] P:1597.87 E:0.095229 |  And Milo at the back
[7073.78 - 7075.78] P:1708.14 E:0.099327 |  That little sort of free
[7075.78 - 7076.78] P:1387.99 E:0.114834 |  Did really well
[7076.78 - 7077.78] P:1461.66 E:0.114397 |  They worked really hard
[7077.78 - 7078.78] P:1727.94 E:0.076395 |  And I think it's down to them
[7078.78 - 7080.78] P:1575.87 E:0.084360 |  Defensively that only
[7080.78 - 7082.78] P:1560.12 E:0.103590 |  That Belgium only scored the 1
[7082.78 - 7083.78] P:1697.45 E:0.095902 |  I don't know what it is with Belgium
[7083.78 - 7085.78] P:1565.94 E:0.091899 |  They're just looking a little bit leggy
[7085.78 - 7086.78] P:1504.05 E:0.094649 |  Ideas Kevin De Bruyne
[7086.78 - 7087.78] P:1281.76 E:0.107947 |  Wasn't on it tonight
[7087.78 - 7089.78] P:1536.43 E:0.093963 |  When he did put a couple of good crosses in
[7089.78 - 7090.78] P:1700.52 E:0.103138 |  I was kind of surprised that
[7090.78 - 7092.78] P:1660.78 E:0.078509 |  He put some good crosses in
[7092.78 - 7094.78] P:1559.57 E:0.097042 |  Yeah, just a little bit
[7094.78 - 7096.78] P:1435.18 E:0.100517 |  Not convinced at all
[7096.78 - 7098.78] P:1478.62 E:0.088674 |  If they want to really go any further
[7098.78 - 7100.78] P:1480.74 E:0.085478 |  In this they're going to have to pick it up
[7100.78 - 7103.78] P:1460.19 E:0.098110 |  100% because any other team they play
[7103.78 - 7105.78] P:1451.60 E:0.091117 |  And they get that much time on the ball
[7105.78 - 7107.78] P:1438.64 E:0.098055 |  Like Canada did in the first half
[7107.78 - 7109.78] P:1519.94 E:0.089614 |  They'll score goals against Belgium
[7109.78 - 7112.78] P:1576.24 E:0.089925 |  John Hurdman's gathered together
[7112.78 - 7114.78] P:1427.04 E:0.098113 |  All of his players and the substitutes
[7114.78 - 7115.78] P:1270.21 E:0.109102 |  And all of the staff actually
[7115.78 - 7117.78] P:1362.77 E:0.089019 |  In the centre circle
[7117.78 - 7119.78] P:1528.69 E:0.088819 |  And they've created a ring around him
[7119.78 - 7121.78] P:1531.35 E:0.102008 |  And he's standing in there in the middle
[7121.78 - 7122.78] P:1607.99 E:0.089254 |  The Englishman
[7122.78 - 7124.78] P:1501.68 E:0.084231 |  And he's got his hand in one pocket
[7124.78 - 7127.78] P:1557.12 E:0.096262 |  He's making his point with the other hand
[7127.78 - 7130.78] P:1634.62 E:0.091890 |  He's turning around 360 degrees
[7130.78 - 7133.78] P:1549.94 E:0.098590 |  This is a very public show of
[7133.78 - 7135.78] P:1674.95 E:0.088674 |  Togetherness really
[7135.78 - 7138.78] P:1623.94 E:0.093862 |  From the Canadian team, the Canadian squad
[7138.78 - 7141.78] P:1716.25 E:0.092772 |  And he's clearly giving the message
[7141.78 - 7142.78] P:1549.30 E:0.109815 |  That in these coming matches
[7142.78 - 7144.78] P:1722.84 E:0.098231 |  For Canada, against Croatia and Morocco
[7144.78 - 7147.78] P:1656.83 E:0.105606 |  And they've now all turned in tightly together
[7147.78 - 7150.78] P:1723.59 E:0.100949 |  On him and are still all together
[7150.78 - 7152.78] P:1767.78 E:0.093350 |  In the centre circle in a very tight huddle
[7152.78 - 7153.78] P:1622.65 E:0.108588 |  Yeah, I think that's great
[7153.78 - 7154.78] P:1634.25 E:0.117972 |  I really do
[7154.78 - 7155.78] P:1806.45 E:0.121762 |  I really do
[7155.78 - 7156.78] P:1671.62 E:0.103498 |  He's basically saying, listen
[7156.78 - 7159.78] P:1719.60 E:0.100490 |  I can basically tell you what he's saying
[7159.78 - 7161.78] P:1735.84 E:0.089056 |  He's saying, listen, you guys did well tonight
[7161.78 - 7163.78] P:1784.94 E:0.103697 |  You're playing against a Belgium side
[7163.78 - 7165.78] P:1718.42 E:0.109628 |  One of the outsiders, whoever they are
[7165.78 - 7166.78] P:1747.57 E:0.098922 |  Got some of the best in the world
[7166.78 - 7168.78] P:1696.83 E:0.105144 |  But I am proud of you tonight
[7168.78 - 7169.78] P:1776.93 E:0.087268 |  Well done
[7169.78 - 7170.78] P:1830.05 E:0.096886 |  The fans are proud
[7170.78 - 7171.78] P:1733.24 E:0.104448 |  All the flags are being waved
[7171.78 - 7172.78] P:1664.95 E:0.096529 |  And the manager's proud
[7172.78 - 7174.78] P:1823.14 E:0.102390 |  They were unlucky tonight
[7174.78 - 7175.78] P:1560.44 E:0.087739 |  Very unlucky
[7175.78 - 7178.78] P:1776.29 E:0.096694 |  Yeah, most of the bulk of the Canadian fans
[7178.78 - 7179.78] P:1668.44 E:0.098533 |  Are still in their positions
[7179.78 - 7182.78] P:1603.53 E:0.103986 |  And he's now leading his team across there
[7182.78 - 7185.78] P:1706.25 E:0.089579 |  And he's applauding the spectators
[7185.78 - 7186.78] P:1692.70 E:0.094981 |  I mean, thousands of them, I hear
[7186.78 - 7188.78] P:1656.67 E:0.095104 |  I presume they'll have come, of course
[7188.78 - 7191.78] P:1729.14 E:0.108056 |  From Canada, probably from all corners of the world
[7191.78 - 7192.78] P:1809.76 E:0.082921 |  Here to Qatar
[7192.78 - 7194.78] P:1676.96 E:0.096790 |  And they've all got their Canadian flags
[7194.78 - 7196.78] P:1564.51 E:0.098200 |  The red and white with the maple leaf on
[7196.78 - 7199.78] P:1757.51 E:0.091030 |  And they're enjoying the moment together
[7199.78 - 7202.78] P:1756.70 E:0.082803 |  Even though they've lost the match
