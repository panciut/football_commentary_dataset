 ...Rabbiol, Dembele, Griezmann and Bappé in Giroux. The referee is from Brazil, Wilton Sampao. He blows his whistle and this World Cup quarter-final between England and France is underway, with the French kicking off. And Harry Maguire receives the ball on the edge of the box and just sweeps the ball out of play on the far side. It's flat. The ball's flat. The quarter-final of the World Cup when it starts as it goes with a flat ball. Well, that is extraordinary, isn't it? Talk about attention to detail. Well, as a test, there's an early test for Wilton Sampao, the Brazilian referee, and Luxor has actually just handed the ball from the side of the pitch to Dembele, and Dembele obligingly throws it back to Jordan Pickford. So, England and France. If England are to reach the semifinals, they will have to do something. They've never done before, not the current World Champions out at a World Cup. England with the ball on the left-hand side, up towards Bellingham. And then it's deflected out of play, and England have a throw, 10 yards inside the French half, but Luxor has come up to take. England at this World Cup, obviously won their group, beat the highest ranked team in Asia, played the champions of North and Central America, another home nation in Wales. They knocked out the African champions, but now it is the holders, and it is England in possession with Harry McQuire, puts his right foot on the ball, has a little look forward, and then plays a long pass down the left flank, which is headed in field. Phil's folding into the action for the first time, but Dembele was back there, and France are able to take possession on the edge of the penalty area with the McCarno and the pressure from Sampao, plays it away, and now it's being brought forward by Hernandez. He loves to get forward, K.O. Hernandez. Now Mbappe is in possession for the first time. Listen to the reaction. He takes on and moves inside Kyle Walker, but there were two England men there, both Saka and Henderson, and they forced Mbappe back, but he slips the ball in between them. Kyle Walker steps in, and there's Rabiot, to play it back towards the half-way line. So there we are, Rob Green, first round. Yep, it's one little opening there that hadn't Mbappe ready. He was waiting to pounce. Saka misjudging that pass, gambling, shouldn't have gone, and all of a sudden, Hernandez, as you say, John, loves to get forward. Yeah, they come again, this time a back heel from Mbappe near the edge of the England penalty area. Rabiot, but then Deutlund Reiss is able to come across, take the ball away, and that's a confidence booster early for him to play a little role like that. Yeah, every touch from these, England play the first touch, is just to get the feet in the game, but not only that. Oh, the ball's been won back by Saka near the centre-circle. He carries it forward, gives it to Kane on the right. Kane tried to cross it, but crossed it straight into Ufa-McCarno, and the ball bounces out towards the right-hand side, where Kane's able to flick it, actually, over his shoulder and infield towards Deutlund Reiss. And so Harry Kane drives a high pass towards the edge of the area. Faran comes across and is able to head it down, and now it's bouncing down into the left full-back position, where France will get it away, although Ufa-McCarno has given it straight to Henderson. And now Henderson to Fulton, and Fulton shot his block by Faran, who is right in front of him, on the edge of the box, Manchester City, blocked by Manchester United. But there are so many familiar confrontations on the pitch this evening, as England come down the left-hand side with Bellingham. Griezmann is right back there, almost in his own right-back position, to put in the challenge on Bellingham, and it was a successful one, and the French have it. England nail, France nail on this Saturday night. There is live Champions Cup rugby union on Sports Extra right now, but there's every chance you might be travelling back from one of the matches domestically this evening. And if you are in your car, I would imagine you're glued to this, as Maguire wins the ball back from Griezmann. And now Maguire in front of the centre-circle, angles are passed, out towards the left-hand side, Thordon takes it down, Phil Thordon, still England in possession, Bellingham is out there as well, Bellingham. Then to Luxior, who dances away from the challenge of Griezmann. Bellingham turns, still two Frenchmen in front of it. And then Thordon with a flick, De Ballet with a challenge, and the referee says, yes, free kick England. Yeah, really strong start by England, confidence start, one on the front foot, and it's two styles, England pressing, they lose the ball high in the France half, they're going, they're going for it, they're looking to press, Sackle one-one, misjudged the other, that's the risk. France will drop, they'll drop into that medium to low block, that Julian was talking about, they're comfortable sitting in their own half. So a free kick, first free kick on the left-hand side. England, at the 12 goals that they've scored at this World Cup, only two have been from set pieces. So here is Luxior waiting on the left-hand side, England who are playing from left to right as we look in this first half. Sure, waiting, one foot in front of the other on the left-hand side. Referee still sorting one or two things out on the edge of the penalty area. Harry Maguire, the eye is naturally drawn to him, right towards the far side of the penalty area, Shaw swings it in, Maguire is deepening the air, and the ball is headed away, and actually there was an offside flag up against England, and it's a free kick to the French in their own penalty area. An interesting little battle in there, Harry Kane looking to block the runs. Just Maguire was a fraction offside, maybe, but Kane was doing the blocking for Declan Rice in the centre, Maguire and Stones at the far post. It's a formidable force, and as you look at it for England attacking that ball. England, Nill, France, Nill. So this is five-live, via BBC Sounds as well, if you're on the move tonight, and we're also live across Africa on the World Service tonight. The two goals, by the way, from the set pieces that England have scored so far, the goal that Saka scored in the first match against Iran, which came from a corner, from Shaw, which was headed across the box by Maguire, and the other was the free kick, the Marcus Rashford free kick, against Wales in the third group match. Rashford on the bench tonight, a long ball forward from the back, four France, Walker heads it down, but he's headed it straight to Giroux, and now Mbappe with the right-footed ball, Maguire with a challenge on Giroux in the area, who couldn't get to it, England struggling to get it away. Dembale on the right-hand side, comes back centrally, Kunde is there, his left-footed ball is straight into the part of Shaw, who took a heavy touch, and Dembale was there, so Shaw had to quickly... recover and put it out of play. Now, discussion going on between Stones and Walker. He didn't hear the call, he's saying, we heard it from up here. Just play it back to Pickford, he was waiting. That's Rob Green, England's World Cup goalkeeper. We're watching from on high, up here on the top tier, at this Al-Beh stadium. The dark, desert skies are bulged, and the other thing that we've not mentioned is, this is, by a distance, the inverted commas, coolest night of this World Cup so far, as Henderson carries the ball forward, and then it's played back into the back line. I don't think there's many people at home having much sympathy for us out here. That is a very good point. Henderson, out to the left. It's quite breezy as well, but it's clops on tonight, as Maguire plays the ball to the right, to Stones. Here gives it back to Maguire. He has a little look forward, and then drags the ball onto his right foot and goes for a long, long pass, which I think will be beyond Sakuride's and Ben's's through for a goal kick. So England, France, Mill, Mark mentioned earlier, the terrible news about the death of our journalistic colleague, Grant Wall, last night, who was at the match, the late match last night. FIFA have paid tribute to him tonight, and have put a bouquet on his assigned seat for this match inside the stadium. So they've got a lot of things wrong, FIFA, but that is a nice touch. Goal kick that Loris will take down there to our right. 143rd cap, it's also a record 18th World Cup appearance for France. He's making this evening, Bellingham getting up high, but Rabiot is head-and-a-cross, there's a stretch from Giroud, who plays the ball back into his own half. And France start with Varan, who just works it towards the right-hand side. Dempeli is there, Griezmann looking for those spaces. Back to Dempeli, whose low ball in is all half cleared on the edge, with the six-yard box by Stones. England were a little fortunate there that that didn't drop to a blue shirt. Yeah, really, good block by John Stones. Out, stretch right, like just getting the faintest of touches was enough, but that play down right, rather than what we anticipated, down the left, opened us up. Yeah, Griezmann, this is good. Dempeli and Griezmann together on the right-hand side, Jake's almost past them, Bellingham puts in the challenge, went to ground. He's saying that he deflected the ball back onto Griezmann in behind, but the assistant on the far side says, corner France. Still a photos, just a little fraction too high. He's leaving, Luxor exposed out there, against the two of Griezmann, who's drifted out there with Dempeli. Very difficult to hinder out to the two of them. So England now have to face the set piece. And the referee, bright orange shirt, has trotted across with meaning to talk to Jordan Pickford, 50th cap tonight, clean sheets in his last three here at this World Cup. Bapé is standing on him, players are grouped around the penalty spot. Three England, four England players standing in front of it, the French players in the line, a little bit like the England set piece routine at the last World Cup. So Griezmann with a corner delivery into the near post, is headed away. Harry Kane was there, inside the six-yard box at the near post, and folded. He's able to get a deflection off Dempeli, and it's out for a throw in to England. Deltwith. Yeah, there's a good header by Harry Kane. John Snow's a just-losted man, I think it's Olivier Giroud. Just by half a yard, it's so difficult in there. Having all those bodies, you've got to find your man, stay with him, tracking. And of course, they're hot on the holding in this World Cup. Yeah, Yulia Ferre, defended set pieces against Olivier Giroud. He's a real presence in there, isn't he? He's cute, cute in the mind. Oh, and back the course, went back by Frank Transe, shore caught up the field, Griezmann out to the right. That's like diving head-off from Giroud, but it's straight at goalkeeper Pickford. He had to stretch for that, and Stones was putting him under pressure as well. And he headed it probably through about knee-thigh height, but straight at Pickford. Nihon impossible to score from there, going back towards your own goal. Getting the angle on it was hard, but Luke Shaw is isolated out there. England just needs to readjust slightly. Thought the threat was going to come down the left, and a minute, de Ballet, he's finding space down the right, and it's all due to Griezmann just drifting. And they're onto that, Frank Transe. Didier Deschamps and his team have either worked on that before the match, or they've spotted it already in this game, and Griezmann is spending a lot of time over there. So first savoured the match then, first attempt on goal, on target by Olivier Giroud. But England, with a ball on the other side, their right-flat walker plays it centrally to the 19-year-old, Jude Dalingham. Being such an important figure in this England run to the last eight of the World Cup. If you have just got into your car, switched on your radio, the extraordinary news of the World Cup already today is that Morocco are through to the last four, the first African team to reach the semifinals of the World Cup. And Morocco will play the winners of this one on Wednesday night in this stadium. And that will be like this one, seven o'clock kick-off in the UK, ten o'clock kick-off here in Qatar. France with a ball inside their own heart. And back it goes into the round, just touches out towards the left-hand side. And now up on the car now, looking for Theo Hernandez. Theo Hernandez moving in field and then knocking it back into central defence to Varan. Missed the first match, Varan, that having fear that he would miss the whole World Cup with that injury at Chelsea really just a few weeks ago. It's been a remarkable recovery for the Manchester United now. Theo Hernandez again, touches foot on the ball and then passes it back into the centre-circle. England are just sitting off the World Champions at the moment, Varan coming forward again. There's Griezmann out towards the right-hand side again. Griezmann squared and Rabiol then back to Griezmann and then out comes Henderson to put Griezmann under pressure. Theo Hernandez once more and it goes back to the halfway line to Ufa Mokami. And then in comes Reis for the challenge, that's good, excellent tackle. Harry Kane is able to take it on, he's got Frenchman either side of him. Kane is forced to take it out towards the right flank, Reis is there as well. Henderson behind him and Henderson goes back to the halfway line. What a tackle. Yeah, brilliant and we've seen it so many times with Declan Reis waiting, picking the pass to attack, did it with conviction. So it is now England with the ball inside the French half. And here is Declan Reis again, had a confident start to the game. Reis back again to Walker who looks up. England with the back four again tonight, again the 4-3-3 as Walker takes it again from Jordan Henderson. So now again seven players have started all five matches that England have played at this World Cup. So that is real consistency of selection for the second time at the tournament. Garry Southgate's name and unchanged team having not done it in 53 matches. The first time in end of unchanged team in 54 matches against USA. Henderson's giving it away, Rabiot will take it on, Saka's trying to get there, he goes into the box, gives it to him, Pappe crosses to the back post but Dempelet can't get there, Shaw went with him, they were shoulder to shoulder and Dempelet on the stretch could only put it behind the far post. Well there's the danger from France, Jordan Henderson who's just a slow square ball inside that lack of pace on the ball allowed Rabiot, it's a pounce and from there could they find him, Pappe they could, could he find Dempelet at the far post, he couldn't but France sit, they wait, they'll be patient, they know they've got the ability, they've got the pace, the hurt is on the break. England, Niel, France, Niel BBC Radio 5 live, 6-0-6 tonight as well by the way from 10 o'clock UK time. Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton will be taking your calls, now the TD highlights on the Saturday night, BBC One after the news and then the World Cup Daily podcast in the morning with all of the fallout and reaction from whatever happens over the course of the next hour and a half all there abouts. Still goalless, Maguire and Stoves intercession, now Jordan Henderson after that little error could have been costly but England were able to repel the French, Dullingham to the left hand side, to Luke Shaw and England again content to have it inside their own half. Maguire and now Henderson almost dropping back in between the two central defenders. Yeah the difference between France and England at the moment is the two wide meant of France hanging wide, England are coming narrow making the pitch narrow. Rice turns, it's the ball to Walker on the right hand side, Walker has Saka, Saka is forced out into a wide position, he's claiming that he was fouled, no free kick given, it's being brought forward from the back by Upa Mercano by Inmunic, he gives that to Umpape of Paris Saint-Germain and Umpape had three England players around it and Umpame Mercano is still there and Umpape now gets away from Rice, he's central, gives the ball to the right hand side to Gembelli in the box and Umpape is still available on the edge of the area, back it comes to Griezmann, 20 yards out, now back with the shot, oh what a goal! To Umpape, from 23 yards, the cleanest of strikes, France take the lead and for the first time in this world, Governing the W. 16 minutes played, England nil, France won. Well we thought it might be something special and it was, it may not be from the people, we thought it would be but the threat is there, if you double up out wide it leaves the space in the middle, Germaini stood waiting in the centre of the pitch all the time and space that he wanted to pick the ball up, he was a long way out, he had a good touch, he picked his spot and he hammered it into the corner, three players on one side of the pitch, Tracod and Mbappe, two players on the other side of the pitch with them felling, there's got to be space somewhere, there is in the middle and it's a well worked goal from France. Just took a touch, it was pinpoint, Tickford diving down to his right and on his 50th cap he couldn't get there and the ball was buried into the bottom corner of the England net, France ahead, England behind and the goal was scored just a few yards away from Juliette Farrington. And the celebrations took place at the corner flag to my right John and Jordan Tickford has just taken his place right back at the game restarted, he had a long conversation with Declan Rice and John Stones, he's looking so frustrated and also with Carrie Maguire on that one, hands on hips but the game is back under way, Tickford seems to be now trying to control his frustrations as he's watching on over the pitch. Well England have not been in this position at this World Cup, one nil down, so England have to respond, Tsuomenei scoring brilliantly really, the Real Madrid youngster just 22 years old, just his second goal for France and now England with Saka on the right hand side, Henderson on the overlap, Saka plays it back to Kyle Walker, going in suggesting he might have been fouled on the edge of the box off the ball, however it is Saka again, Saka moving in field, that was a foul by Rabiol, went in rather clumsily and rather heavily on Saka and it is a free kick right of centre and this is what 22-23 yards out, he's done very very fortunate not to get a yellow card there, he goes down, two-footed tackle from behind, not a great deal of force in it, which probably saved him, but a threat for England, Luke Shaw standing over the ball, he'll fancy this. So it is a sad piece of opportunity, England going behind in the 17th minute, that excellent strike it really was, so purely hit on his right foot, but England with Henderson and Shaw and also John Stones has just walked out of the England, putting up a wall next to the French wall, there is a four Frenchman standing in the actual wall, Griesman's on the corner of it, Henderson is pointing at McGuire and now they've backed away and Luke Shaw is left alone, although Jordan Henderson is still making urges and he's telling what it is Harry Kendo is in position on the edge of that wall, so McGuire, there are two England players in this in this wall to the left, as Shaw is looking at it, could be Henderson, could be Shaw, Henderson runs over it, Luke Shaw hits it, but it's sprayed out, Laurie's who's able to take what one and a half steps to his left and gather the ball into his chest. Quick free from Laurie's, it's just that gap between McGuire and Kane, allowed him to see the ball, if you're going to put a wall up, stand together, it's a nightmare for a goalkeeper, don't give that gap, England nil, France won, the only goal for Didier Deschamps side, clinical, and Didier Deschamps standing down there now on the edge of the coaching area, out of contract after this World Cup, what a career, World Cup winning coach, World Cup winning captain, won the Euros, won the Champions League, I mean he's almost done it all and now he's attempting to become the first coach to win back to back World Cups, since real well the early days of the competition, it is England in possession on the halfway line, Stones, Stones just moving the ball across the centre circle and then Bellingham drops deep and will knock it square, Walker who's stretched for that and then Stones nicely turns away from trouble, as Bellingham in front of him, uses Jordan Henderson, now Saka on the right hand side, Saka, Henderson on the overlap, Saka little ball into the box, oh great turn by Kane, out comes Loris, makes the save, Henderson chips it across to the back post, a stretch there by Bellingham, it bounces down in Griesman, is able to clear it away, what a turn by Kane to get away from up on McCano inside the box, but what a save from Loris against his clubmate, fantastic save ready really well, came sliding out low, but managed to hold his arm up high to block the chip, did that for such clever play from Kane, you can't gamble like that, you can't think you're gonna win it, you can't, you can't nick it, he was out so quickly there and there we are, that's the first first time that they have faced off in this game, he was asked about potentially taking penalties against him last night, Harry Kane, he said well you know the thing is I hardly ever take penalties against him at club level, normally take penalties against second third choice goalkeepers, not your first choice, there is that, he's also seen a few, so England denied by the French captain, World Cup winning captain of four years ago, France currently with this goal line on course to get for the semi-finals again, Griezmann playing the ball back to up on McCano, the D on the edge of the penalty area, significant triumph that was though for Kane against him, but France working it forward really nicely and Bapu, those passes intercepted on the halfway line, Beringham Henderson, Beringham wanted it played down the line, challenge came in from Theo Hernandez, ball runs out of play into the French coaching area and it is an England throw, so Tua Mane becomes only the fourth French player to score at this World Cup after himself and Bapu with his five, Giroud and Rabiot who scored the first French goal of the tournament, the full-on win against Australia, England with it in the centre circle, here's John Stones, Bane to Henderson, it's been played at a good tempo, I'm sure the temperature tonight will help with that, Shaw on the left hand side, got the air conditioning of course, but it does feel significantly less warm here tonight, Rice puts his foot on the ball and plays it out to the left hand side to Luke Shaw, now back to McIntyre, so England, Garry Southgate with things to ponder as he stands with his hands in his pockets and watches Harry Kane drop into the centre circle, Rice is there, Thornton comes deep, then Rice forward and through the middle, the Kane, all lovely touch, through towards Bellingham, he's claiming Harry Kane was actually talking to the referee when Bellingham tried to flick it back to Kane, yeah it's handball to try and block the through ball to Bellingham, he's appealed, momentary pause, the situation, or the opportunity went for England because the return ball had come, he does look sharp, I must say Saka hits it in field, but heads it straight to the bombacado and now Hernandez, the left back has given it away, Kane, Kane is into the penalty area, goes down there's a challenge, Kane's flair on his face in the box under that challenge from up on the corner, the referee was close probably eight yards away and he immediately said no, ball bounces out of play on the halfway line, Kane still standing with palms apart, the question is, well I must say that looks like a penalty to me, there's contact, there's a throw of the leg, he goes to play the ball between Harry Kane's leg, that's a penalty, that's a penalty, it's soft but it's from behind, he doesn't win the ball, it's a penalty, it was right on the edge of the penalty area, suppose there's a question there and we are now having a check, the throwing's not been taken, there is a check going on, a VAR check for a possible penalty and we might have that, Kane against Laurie's moment, who we were talking about long before a possible penalty shootout, still the check is going on, the referee just turns away and says I'm still waiting, still waiting, Walker has got the ball to take the throw and the referee is just saying halt, he's putting his hand up like one of those old-time policemen and saying do not take the throw yet, this is a long, long to the naked eye, it seems clear that Kane was caught on the leg by Obama-McCarno, he knows, Harry Kane knows what he's doing, he knows he's the wrong side of Obama-McCarno, he knows that the McCarno's gone to play the ball and he knows that he's in the penalty area, here's the whistle and it's play on, it's not a penalty, well, working that out, the only suggestion I can come up with is that it wasn't in the penalty area, therefore there isn't a decision to be made on whether it was a penalty or not, but Kane fell in the area, it looked like from where we are, there's certainly contact in and around the area, we've seen what, one replay of it from an angle, so it's not looking down the line a little bit like the Japanese ball with the cross etc etc, when Kane fell sprawling into the penalty area, it did look as though it was on the line, maybe slightly over, but no penalty, well that is a controversial moment, we'll let you know if we do get a chance to see that again from a better angle, but it remains England-Nill, France-1, but again Kane pausing problems against Obama-McCarno, yeah that's twice now and Harry Kane fancies it against Obama-McCarno, Obama-McCarno doesn't know when to go, when to come back, when to hold, it's one that certainly Harry Kane really licking his lips on, but what we do know is that it must have been a close call because that took a long time, by FIFA standards that took a long time to rule upon, so France play a long ball for it from the far side, the right hand side from Kunde, but way beyond anyone in a blue shirt, almost half an hour played and France have the edge, the two times winners of the World Cup, 1998 and of course in Moscow, back in 2018, three times finalists, England looking to follow up what they did in the World Cup four years ago and then of course reaching the final last year at the Euros, Maguire carrying it, but towards the halfway line and then a right-footed ball, Henderson is out here, Henderson gets a touch, the ball runs to Saka who tries to win a throw in which succeeds in doing against Fernandez, but then the throw is cut out by Rabiol, but given back to Saka and Saka now up to the edge of the box uses Henderson, Henderson slips the ball in between the legs of Fernandez, but Obama-McCarno is there, clears it, straight to England though, straight to Walker, Jekyll and Rice on his right foot thought about the shot, gives it to Harry Kane who shoots and that needed a good save from Loris who is left, got a good sight on it, but again, Loris denies Kane, fantastic strike from Harry Kane, little work deflection on that which made Loris adjust, maybe he'd have to work his feet, adjust in midair, kinked his body almost to make that save, corner then for England, this is England's first corner of this quarter final, France put two men on England and this is almost like a carbon copy of what we saw when France had their corner at the other end, so two England players, one in front of the other, Kane and Maguire, the two Harrys are there, two Frenchmen just next to the penalty spot, to pack six yard box, Cordon with the delivery, it's flicked across the penalty area, advances down, scorn the six yard box and it's scrambled away by France, Rabiot was able to pounce on the ball and the French were fortunate there, there was no one in a white shirt, good delivery from Cordon, I think schoolboy stuff almost there, an absolute bundle on the ball, just anybody just putting something on the line just to get in the way from France, those problems, Dalligan now to the right hand side, yes Henderson, Henderson, turns, gives it back to Walker on the halfway line, he hit that shot Harry Kane, probably 25 yards giving the angle on the right hand side, but Laurie's diving was there, parrying it away, so that's two saves for Laurie's against Kane and then Dalligan, I don't think England will get that free kick, but Dalligan wants near the edge of the box, Saka, that might have been a foul, ball bounces away in behind and the assistant is not giving a decision, so both sets of players down there are retealing and the referee says it's a goal kick, Saka still talking about it, that's what the whistle is for that you can hear, the referee saying to Bukajosaka, come on come away, the goal kick France, but it's been a good response from England, you have to say that they were rocked by that goal and they weren't coming up with answers, it's been really positive since then, been on the front but been asking the questions, we've seen a replay of the goal, we certainly haven't seen a replay of the penalty incident, so England nil, France won, hopefully we'll get to see it at some stage, you would like to think as it bounces out of play for a throw into England half inside their own half, so England behind, it really hasn't happened very often at tournament Sunday Gareth Southgate, remember the semi-final against Denmark, when the Dames scored the first goal that England had conceded at the Euros last year and England eventually turned it around in extra time, a fortunate penalty in extra time to win it, even themselves out in the end, it's taken a couple of years, throwing for England, Bellingham, Rabiot is able to take it down, but it has been a good response to going a goal down, you know that's a shell shock in a match like this, on occasion like this, as Loris plays it forward, but you're on a tightrope aren't you, one nil down, Kane Winkser, Shugged over by Rabiot, 10 yards inside his own half, you're on a tightrope, one nil down against France with the attacking Callans that they have and the damage that they can do is England push forward and what they can do on the break, absolutely, but they're doing it in the right way I think and they're forcing Loris to kick long, they have hardly played out from the back really France and you're looking for England, where can we cut the supply off, certainly in Bafail, Dembale don't want to get me going ahead in the ball, so we've got Ryse McGuire, Stones there for that, they'll fancy them, over half an hour played, 33 minutes at straight on the clock and England go back to Stones in central defence, Stones carrying it forward into the centre circle and passing it short to Gallingham, Orl who's giving it away to Mbappe and Mbappe moves away out towards the left hand side, Walker is there, he takes on Walker who has a success against Mbappe, block me attempt the ball, he was looking a slippy pass then, Walker blocked it and then there's a foul on Saka and England have a free kick, yeah, did well, between them Saka and Walker, particularly Walker holds his hand up for Bellingham immediately, there's a pull back with ball, Thornton Hart was in your mouth for a moment there from an English perspective, but Carl Walker was calm, composed, ready well, England got away with two mistakes now centre field, Henderson early on in the match, Jude Dallingham there, you wouldn't like to see England make another mistake like that, there's only so many you feel you can make like that, Maguire with that long pass out towards the right hand side looking for Saka, but it's headed away by Hernandez, Henderson now, Henderson in field towards Dukaio Saka, Saka back to Henderson, then to Saka again, Saka goes away from Ravio into the penalty area still going and then Hernandez puts in the challenge, referee was right there three four yards away, immediately pointed and said that Hernandez had got the ball in that challenge with Saka, so Jiru now over the halfway line, here's Dembele on the right hand side, Luke Shaw has gone with him, Thornton is now coming back to help Shaw and that means that he has to go back further to the goal scorer, Turemeini, who I've hardly mentioned his name, well interesting, we've hardly mentioned Griezmann after since saying he was finding the spaces, just there, he held the centre circle, no no no no no, just give me the ball back here, I don't want to make difference right now, I want to control the game. England nail France one for placing the semi-finals against Morocco, as Griezmann will give it back to Verran, Verran just shuffles forward in those orange boots and then a pass from Dembele down the right to Griezmann and Griezmann is not able to get past Garryman, Luke found himself as the recovering man in the left back position and then hits a long left-footed pass up to the halfway line and France will start again in the centre circle, yeah they've recovered that, England had that storm for probably one 10-15 minutes or so but the French now have got more of the ball and more of the possession, Griezmann then in goes right, strong challenge again, this one on the radio and the French have to go all the way back to their goal. But it's better for me that Bellingham has just been a little bit more composed, a little bit more aware in there and looking where Griezmann is and saying right okay that's my role, I'm going to have to be the one to get out to him. The French have got it, the blue, white and red, Griezmann, long left-footed ball out to the left-hand side that is tested down by Hernández, the sack that was back there, I mean you can see the work that has to be done here, the balls teams, yeah there's there's that doubling up, the four players are expected for both teams because of the threats that there are, this time it was Sacher helping out Walker, France, here's Tua Mane, Tua Mane away the two number eights together running away from us so we can see them clearly, those numbers, gold on the back of the blue French shirt and Tua Mane actually plays it with Henderson following him all the way back to goalkeeper, Loris, long and left-footed from him, and comes McGuire with the challenge, ball runs to Fordham, Fordham, there's Prypt by Griezmann, that's a free kick, that's a free kick to England, the other half-way line, yeah they're doing a good job though England again, Loris, they're not messing around, they're not they've had Veran as the spare man at the back, they could easily play it out, they didn't, they went long to Giroud, Rice in front, Stones and McGuire in behind, we'll have that thank you very much, translating 1-0, 17th minute goal from Orlean, Tua Mane, the young king as they call it, clearly got a great great future ahead of him and he's the man who's making the difference between England and France just now, Henderson playing the ball back to McGuire, then out to the left hand side, Shaw kills it for it but that's asking too much of Bellingham, although Veran on the edge of the box just cleared away with Bellingham arriving on the scene, now Walker alone allows the ball to bounce over Shaw's end, just gets up and bolleys it back to Jordan Pickford in the goal, England conceding for the third time at this tournament, two goals against Erran but that one there, super strike really, we've seen some really outstanding goals haven't we in the knockout stages and indeed throughout the course of this World Cup, Stones back to the left hand side to McGuire, Shaw's available out on the left but McGuire's going to look for that long pass again to Henderson, that's asking a lot of the Liverpool captain, he won't reach that, skidded off the turf and into the advertising hoardings, you've probably heard the splat as it did so, so a throw into France, yeah it's on though, it's on because outside, out there John Henderson's pulling very wide, Sackers coming inside, that combination, that pair and have had joy down this right hand side, combining along with Harry Kane, that's where the chances have come from so a throw in to France, I said in my preview this morning, you know talking about the milestones that the two goalkeepers would reach this evening, one or the other could keep a clean sheet tonight, they might well be on the winning team and at the moment that would be Hugo Loris and Bapé with a run forward but he has his heels clipped, goes down, that's a free kick, just caught there, little foul by Jordan Henderson but a free kick in the middle of the England half towards the left hand side, set peace chance for France, you look at Karl Walker and the relative success that he's had so far off against Gillian and Bapé, yes you don't want him running up against him but you've got to pack your man, you pack your man to defend England holding their line outside the penalty area, Griezmann, he can be brilliant with these deliverings from this sort of area, Griezmann winning his 115th cap tonight, Griezmann actually plays it short, it's flicked into the penalty area on the left hand side and then Hernandez works it across, Arland, Bapé is underneath that but it bounced up, he snatched at it rather, the great man and lifted it high over the crossbar from 12-13 yards, it was awkward, it was clever initially, have a couple of passes to get it to Téhanan, there's an hit well just to cut it back and then from there you are heart and mouth moment as it comes to him, then a good 20 rows back, England nil, France won, five lives and BBC sounds and across Africa on the World Service, at the moment it would be France, Morocco which would be extraordinary event as the ball is played to the left hand, to the right hand side by Saca, Saca juggles the ball and then gets it down on the playing surface, Saca infield to Folden, now John Stones halfway inside the French half, gives it to his Manchester City team, now he has Henderson on that flank as well, he's appeared for the time being on the right, Henderson rolls the ball into the penalty area to Bellingham and then Bellingham angles it back to Saca and then Saca curls it in, looking for that ball to the back post which is headed away defensively, Kunde was able to come across and get up in front of Harry Kane and make the clearance clear of the way downfield, a little bit of a stretch there for Rice but there was a foul by Dan Ballet on the West Ham captain and it's a free kick to England 10 yards inside the row, Rob Green. Yeah it's just it's good possession for England in writing around the French penalty area but just feeling that they're a man short in the combination so just need another man in there to combine, to finish off a pass, to finish off a move, it's just not quite there yet. Thornton sending it through the middle Bellingham back towards Rice again, so England in centrefield, Declan Wright just opens his palms and then plays it through to Thornton but as the challenge came in it ran away from him, France have got it back, Greensman and then Gippa McConaugh back to Greensman again but comes Kunde from the right back position, we've not seen too much of him pushing forward Kunde but he is now advancing in the forward position, Dembele then plays it back to Rabiot and then we'll all through the middle to run back there and then back into the centre circle, halftime less than four minutes away, big team talk coming for Gareth Southgate and it stays like this, Greensman to the right hand side, Dembele again dangerously onto his left foot but England are wise to that, Bellingham comes across and blocks it out, just rolled down the right hand side, ten yards back from the corner flag, it's taken quickly to Dembele, Dembele rolls it in field, Trumani is there, confident flick back centrally to Gippa McConaugh who swings a right footed pass to the left hand side, Hernandez, now Rabiot, Rabiot with Saka in front of him, Bame takes a touch as John Stones comes in, the ball runs out of play and Bame went sprawling down, now he's on his knees off the field suggesting that the referee got a push from John Stones, referee not interested throwing England, good decision not enough in that looking for it, went down easy, well I hope we'll be able to see a better view of the England penalty appeal at halftime and there's the yellow card the first one for a trip on Kyle Walker as he was bringing the ball forward and it is, Greensman who is yellow carded for that, not his first foul, no knew what he was doing, Walker was away through the minutes driving into the centre of the pitch and see it so often just that deliberate trip but I would say he's been an absolute joy to watch Greensman so far, he has been the difference between the two teams, he's hated the play when France have had it, yeah super player as we know and even though he's not yet got under the score sheet at this World Cup he's been such an important part, Greensman of what Didier Deschamps side of done so far at this tournament and the moment the World Champions are on course to return to the semi-final this time, Declan Rice does well, gets away but he comes to the sliding challenge, it was Dembele who put that in on Declan Rice, 30 yards from the French goal and he's back up on his feet and he's bringing the ball forward Dembele and Bellingham puts in the challenge but Dembele keeps his feet, centrally is now and then rolls it back to Tune in, he was just behind the ravioli there as well with that hair tied back behind his head and now Kundé on the right flank France just knocking it around inside the England half, Bapu is now drifted inside playing also, well he is a second centre forward alongside Olivier Giroud, I think he's feeling a little bit left out on that left-hand side and England have handled him well in the main, he's not been the problem, the problem is England are losing, Saka to Walker and then Rice, Cross it goes to Bellingham, how do they, to the left flank again, Shaw is there, so Bellingham makes that run, he just so well find the space, Bellingham takes on his man, left for the ball into the penalty area, that's cleared away by Varan, back out to where it came from, headed forward by Kundé, flicked forward by Griezmann, the French supporters down in that corner of the ground, enjoyed that, a big French cheer went up for that, they've got their their tricklers, their French tricklers, they're twirling them around as France come forward over the halfway line, I mean when cut out that attack and then K.H.T. is up with the McCarno, saw his chance there, Kain took a touch and having come out second against Harry Kain and at least have a couple of occasions, in he went there and put in the challenge out for a throw, he's tried to nick a couple and failed, he wasn't going to miss that one and it wasn't a nick, it was not, Kain shrugged it off and was up on his feet very quickly, so we'll have four minutes about a time at the end of this first half, France leading through the 17th minute goal, Henderson back to to John Sturms, he gives it to McGuire, who's right over there on the left hand side, Guire has a look forward and he's going for that pass again, the crossfield pass back there, who is stationary as he controlled it on his left instep, Henderson makes the overlapping run, France have got three men there but Sackle rolls it infield and Walker arrives and now Kain under pressure from up on McCarno back to Sackle, he finds Kain but is back to the penalty area and England go back and then Kain goes down again up on McCarno suggesting there was nothing in that but it was long after the ball had gone, now Sackle centrally trying to find a way through but no he can't do that, too congested, France bring the ball away, Touemene, Touembappe, Walker just stands off him, Bellingham arrives to help out the England right back, now Griezmann that might have been afoul by Sackle on Touemene but France have still got it out to the right hand side it goes, Griezmann is there with his bleach-blonde hair, Griezmann turns and just gives it back behind him, had almost two minutes of the thought to be added on at the end of this first half Griezmann just there on the ball, he's like he's playing in the park, he just did a little twirl on the ball in the centre of the pitch, he's playing without a care in the world, he's wandered around at times but it's so clever what he's doing, the pockets he's picking up, the spaces he's finding France very happily take this score line at the break, one goal and in fact they go and take it all the way back into their own half, Gouppermakano they hit a long pass that Walker will just turn around to run behind and it will be a goal kick for England, take this quickly which he does into the third minute of added time, Maguire carrying the ball forward, just knocks it to his right, just thought about the long ball, Kane is through the middle in between the two central defenders moment at England still with the ball inside their own half, Bellingham goes down, that was off the ball, Saka has it, so England go back again, 90 seconds of the first half to play, stones to Maguire on the left hand side, Floodan makes a run for it, Shaw gives it back to Maguire and then it's a long pass from Shaw, that's asking a lot, it might have come off Pounday, the two of them went together, it gave it to England's corner right at the end of the first half, England have stayed in the game, without the better you'd say after France have scored, won't be this two, this aren't even if they don't score, but fantastic opportunity at the end. So looking down to our right, England this time for this corner which is only that second of the match, there are now four or five England players, so all of the England players in the penalty area are doing the bus queue routine and whatever you like to call it, three, four, five of them lining up one behind the other, the French defenders are there, here's Floodan's delivery, Maguire's underneath it but it's over Maguire and it bounces out to the right hand side, 30 seconds of the first half to play, Bellingham's ball back in is miss hit and that gives France the chance to come out with it but then Bellingham in with a challenge, over McCarno first time on the edge of the box, slices it away, the referee stopped play because Hernandez I think it is has come off worst in that challenge and so the referee has stopped playing, in England are saying well it's not a head injury, why do you stop play? No it looked awkward, it looked like not a clumsy challenge from Duke Bellingham but he won the ball but it's full blooded and it's he's dropped to his knees as he's got into the challenge, he's almost out of control but won the ball, he was a good corner from England, Harry Maguire was free, it's a good routine, just slightly over hit, Hernandez is back on his feet, play is going to resume with a dropped ball and I think that'll be it at the end of the first half, we've already had 30 seconds over the four minutes of added time, England nil, France won, really not too many chances in the match, beautifully taken goal by Tuanani in the 17th minute, Girere had his header before that, Bappe had that one chance really and England's opportunities have been better and there is the halftime whistle, Hugo Loris has made two important saves, England thought they should have had a penalty, there was a long DAR look at it, that was when England shortly after England had taken the lead but the DAR decision was no penalty and so that Tuanani goal means that France, the champions had the edge at halftime, still England players, Harry Maguire, Foden, Bellingham as well are talking to the officials as they now head towards the dressing rooms, Rob Green. Well, signs of good teams, they score when they're on top and France scored when they were on top, they scored a wonder goal, wonder strike, England had their time on top, created a couple of chances, didn't score and that's the difference really so far, it's on a knife edge but France have just had that moment of quality when they were on top. England are going to reach semi-finals at consecutive World Cups, they're going to have to do it from behind at halftime, England nil, France won is the score and Mark Chapman is here with us inside the Albaid Stadium. England have had more attempts at goal, Rob Green have had more possession, they're frustrated at the end, they need to channel that frustration. Yep, but also not this hard, I think they'd be encouraged, they can get into the game and you look at the way that they've gone about it and at times have managed to win the ball back, I think that's the key thing, win the ball back high and then go again and recycle the ball is their modern parlance but from there I think they've got more in the tank than France, they've got more to stay in the game, they've got a score whilst we're in it and on top. In the main Antoine Griezmann's killing England, isn't he? Oh he's been an absolute pleasure to watch Griezmann, he's so clever, what he's doing is dropping real deep to receive the ball, playing a one-touch pass into a defender or another midfielder and then making that run behind Bellingham, forcing Bellingham out on that left-hand side and he doesn't know whether to stay or go, does Bellingham and he's controlling the pace, there was a moment in the game there when normally we'd ask for the ball, he was like no, calm, let me get into the position where I want to receive it to her England and he's been the best player on the pitch by far. The inside right channels or the right channel is actually where both sides are probably getting the most joy actually because England's most amount of joy comes from Saka and Kane maybe drifting over more this one. What's really happening is Saka's staying really wide, Kane coming deep which is being effective and what Kyle Walker has noticed that when he's got an opportunity to go and Bap is not coming with him and on one occasion it's positive if you get the outcome of a goal or an assist but unfortunately him being up the field then trying to get back it forced three players around and Bap and what do we say where's the space going to be, he's going to be on the other side, ball goes over to the side and it's a Griezmann who gets the assist for two of many and this is such an intriguing game, tactical battle has been brilliant but I think England actually have been excellent, you know Kane had a couple of chances on another day against Leriz, he sticks that away, they could have had a penalty so they'll go into the halftime with their heads held high, they just need to make sure they finish some challenges in the second half. We've only seen one replay, I have to say to the naked eye it looked like the challenge on Kane was outside the box which I'm guessing is why the referee wasn't sent to the monitor to agide on it because it must have been outside the box and they are judged on that. There are some suggestions there might have been a foul on Saka in the build-up to the French goal but I mean that was way back in the move, it's a gilet en aron back with us, it's a fascinating game of chicken in many ways, it's England press press and if England go for the press and France beat it from their own defensive line with England high up then that's where France are then going to cause the dangers. Yeah you're right I think everything we expected really that we mentioned in the build-up the role for Griezmann who, Michael is right, I've been outstanding really the player of this game, the way he's controlled, the way he finds that space and then you're right on the penalty that Rob was saying recovered the ball high because it's a high recovery on that penalty shout and England have to do that more, you can still put Theo on the pressure, you can put Kunde on the more pressure even than that, you can put Chouamini on the more pressure where I thought France was at times quite comfortable is that clearly Chouamini is on Bellingham, clearly Rabiot is on Henderson and either Giroud or Griezmann follows Reiss which means I think for them has to come inside to create a bit more trouble in this French side because right now when the game is in front of them when Maguire or Stone have the ball or Reiss drops it's a bit too easy, it's a bit too predictable. And that's what I thought I said maybe Rob the last 10-15 minutes I mean we saw Foden over here on the right at one stage I wonder whether they got word out try and go in those half spaces between you know inside a little bit and see what what trouble you could cause and maybe Bellingham as well. Yeah what are you looking at the switch and Harrogua has done the switch a lot which is great and find it if you find your man but then that man's isolated on his own because he's such a long way from his own players so you need to get the players over us in the commentary saying we're a player short at the moment in the build up in the combinations and that's what we're trying to do allow Phil Foden to come and wall the way across because yeah sackers going wide sackers fine enjoy so get out there get Henderson out there and then play a little game of keep ball can you get it into the little area bit up next to the penalty area to then drive in that's going to be the key that's where we are because also Kane will come over and he's got the hat up a hand against Upper McCarna. Yeah Kane's decided Upper McCarna is who he's going to go up against doesn't he? And we said it again before before the game I think it was it's obvious one Upper McCarna makes a big mistake on a big chance and I think Kane is a little bit slower I have to say to if he'd been a bit sharper he would have been even earlier on the ball and I think he would have been there too early for Lloris and instead Athol he was slightly slow to react maybe or to get in in front of Upper McCarna and then Lloris makes a really good save and we mentioned Hugo before on how he had to respond tonight and having a good game and so far I have to say he's done great and there will be more pressure for Mingdan in the second half for me it's not going to be a nice watch that second half I can guarantee you. Jules it would be fair to say wouldn't it I mean you're down there. Pissed out England did seem to cut frustrated figures at the end of that first half. Frustrated figures but Jordan Pickford wants to watch watching Killian and Bate from this viewpoint behind Jordan Pickford's goal in the first half a devastating pace that he's got he turned Declan Rice in the middle in the build up to that goal that frustrated Jordan Pickford he hasn't been in the best of moves obviously in the first half and he had a really long chat with Declan Rice as the French players were celebrating in the corner flag to my left here and then interestingly during that VAR penalty check Garith Southgate had a long conversation with Declan Rice as well he's been turned by Mbappe two or three times in this first half and the England fans behind me the mood was so good we had the cardboard cut out of David Beckham who's also here in the stadium tonight but just looking around me now they're sort of slouched on the on the wall in front of them if they are on the front row others are just checking in on their phones the mood certainly needs to be lifted and the way they they ran off the England players they ran off the pitch to go into that halftime team talk it didn't look too bad they thought we're still in it they the mood looked good as far as the players were concerned but Jordan Pickford probably the most frustrated of the loss and hopefully you know whatever's being said in that dressing room right now at halftime that energy is going to be channeled if you're an England fan and a more positive response will be in the second half well John Murray's used a sort of mixture of Mime and ITV screens to to try and see because they've had more replays than us to try and see whether it was outside the box or not yeah well our colleagues Simon Lydix and they're down there and I caught their eye and they're intimated that they felt that it was a penalty and I've I can see their pictures from here and I must say the picture we've not had these pictures it did look to me as though the contact was inside the penalty area Rob at the I can't Harry Kane is I don't know how many hundreds of games he's played and hundreds of goals he's scored he knows what he's doing he's not going to go down if he's outside the box in his instinct it's under his feet or it's not he knows where he is so surely he's there he's the best person to judge that he knows he's got the wrong side of a moment up on the car now he knows the tackles come in he knows where he is either in or around the penalty area I just I mine thinks that penalty the replays are tight but I still stick with that I think so I have to say I thought it was a pen straight away from where from where we sit here I think we had a very good angle of it I have to be honest I'm not even sure it's outside of the box I think that yeah I think I thought it was going to be given as a review from the arm. Jules for the moment thank you and Rob and Micah and John second half on the way England go down against the French as we approach eight at court let's just take the latest BBC News.

England 202 for five in their second innings at the closed coverage back and away from around 445 on Sports Extra tomorrow morning later tonight on Sports Extra we've got boxing Josh Warrington against Luis Alberto Lopez in that IBF featherweight title fight at Leeds Arena former Supermiddleweight champion Karl Frosch joins us from there now what are his chances Karl? Josh Warrington he's got a hard fight ahead of him I mean is Lopez the slight favourite it's hard it's hard to say only 29 years old he's had a good career 26 wins only two losses and he's on a good bit of a run so I think Warrington's got his work quite out but his here at home in Leeds you know what he's like he's a warrior he finds a little bit like myself where's his heart on his sleeve gets stuck in he tries to win every round he's he's a tough strong guy Warrington it's hard to write him off I've done that a couple of times in the past I thought Lee Selby might do him on skill and that Warrington was just too much for him so if he can turn up tonight like he did against someone like Selby I reckon he's got every chance of winning this it's a good one they've paused the bounce haven't they so that everybody can watch the foreboard before the boxing restart I mean he's a Leeds lad in front of is he in front of his home crowd if this goes wrong for England here in Qatar tonight he'll just hope that his own fans can rouse themselves to get themselves going for the fight well hopefully he can build them back up yeah but how do they stop a boxing match for a football match I asked myself I suppose it is the World Cup so we can we can allow that but no if we do lose which I hope we don't what was still one we're one nil down aren't we I mean what a shame and Harry Kane's had a couple of chances well did he he needed to clip one over the goalkeeper then he he had that I don't look like a penalty to me he got tucked down I never went to the AR like I've seen worse penalties given I'm not a massive football fan but I want England to do the business you might have seen more replays of it then by the sounds of it than than we have here Carlson because you've got you seem to have a better view the penalty than the ones they showed us in the monitor listen look if if if Josh Warrington wins tonight what will be next for him well is it that Asian is at that career where now he needs to be in world title fights so I mean you've got Lee Ward from Nottingham which I think is a great fight but he's been injured injured with his arm but with his arm he's had a bad arm but Leo Santa Cruz for me that's a great fight and that's one I'd like to see because I've seen him a couple of times live and I think he's made for Josh Warrington that'd be a great win for him so I'd like to see that one happen thank you very much Carl come on wonder what kind of injury you had for a minute thank you very much Carl Frotz with us and the boxing live on sports extra from around 10 o'clock Josh Warrington against Luis Alberto Lopez and then the cricket back on sports extra 445 tomorrow morning the French are already back out and England are going to create chances in the second half Mike aren't they on the evidence of that first that's what they have to keep reminding themselves for sure they just have to be patient but I think at some stage they're going to have to bring folding inside and bring on some pace of a sterling or a rashford to exploit down the wings because on that counter attack France do look a little bit vulnerable Kane's coming deep so if they can get runners in behind they'll create a little bit more okay England are back out Paul is on the centre spot let's rejoin Rob Green and John Murray thank you Mark no changes so England with Tickford Walker Stones McGuire and Shaw Henderson Rice and Bellingham Saka Kane and Foden and France also in change for this match Loris Kunde Varan Uppermakano and Hernandez Gulskoor a Tumani and Ravio Gimbele Griezmann and Bapé and Giroud just so Jermaine Genus who was on his way up to his seat I said to him penalty he said yes penalty should have been but it wasn't so England have got to put it behind them and respond in the second half Rob Green with us here in the commentary position as the second half begins England kickoff in the white shirts blue shorts and white socks against France in the dark blue shirts with the green numbers and trim white shorts and red socks and in the second half England as we loop from where up here are playing from right to left a massive 45 minutes of world cup football coming here on five live and BBC sounds and across Africa on the world service from here in Qatar Tickford with the ball well outside his penalty area passes it to Luke Shaw and then McGuire back to Luke Shaw Bellingham allows it to run Bellingham then takes it back from Fordham and Bellingham carrying it on is challenged by Dembele at Runster Fordham whose cross low into the penalty area is lacked behind by Upo McCarno and that's a yellow card for Dembele's challenge on Jude Bellingham and the referee played an advantage there it will be a corner and that is a yellow card for Dembele. Good early play from England combining down the left hand side Bellingham taking the blow and it was a rash challenge from Dembele but England have to stay confident in this half have to keep on creating the chances and have to stay positive when they're out of possession I think that's key to this second half corner for England from the left Fordham to take it flight to he's looking for McGuire but it's headed away by Varan comes out to the edge of the area oh Bellingham with a shot from the D and Loris makes the save leaping high that was brilliantly hit in the D and Bellingham there is waving his arms at the England fans behind that goal to tell them to up the volume third big save from Loris. Yeah fantastic save and one that gets congratulations from his team makes Bellingham can't believe it probably just too close to Loris too central but great reactions hit it really well. Fordham's gone out to the far side now to take this corner so it'll be a left-footed in swinger just the two men near the penalty spot this time lots of movement in the six yard box deep onto the back post McGuire with a header and it bounces off Rice back into the clubs of Loris. McGuire again found the space got his head to the ball but it didn't fall for England. Loris sixes and sevens that went drifting way beyond his far post and tripped over his own feet I think it's starting to think it's someone's day when the ball just dropped back into his hands rather than into the net. I'm thinking back to the remember the nation's league final of last year which is a brilliant match and Loris had just one of those days and he's had he's had a lot of one of those days playing for the French national team and here he is that's why he's won 143 caps and it is France who are ringing the ball out from the back twice kept out Harry Kane in the first half important save from Bellingham even though you perhaps was found wanting a little there in those moments and Super McConnell takes the ball away from Henderson and then is fouled by Saka and that is a free kick just to the left of the centre circle stopped in his tracks by Saka that's a mismatch isn't it Saka Saka taking down up a McConnell to a Manny and then France going back into their own half France with the ball on the left hand side Rabiol giving it to Mbappe and Mbappe now to England then there Henderson and Walker and then down he goes that is a free kick Jordan Henderson is pleading and I think he's suggesting that there wasn't a great deal in that and Mbappe has thrown himself to the ground but it's a free kick that's been given yeah it's a modern day foul where Mbappe's running down the wing does a step over pushes the ball forward and then stops running and Jordan Henderson runs into the back of his heels minimal contact he had possession decided to fall over wins a free kick in a dangerous area yeah it is Griezmann has gone over there to take it Griezmann holding figure in the first half four friends Griezmann waiting to take this England here's Griezmann's delivery into the near post what a good delivery that was had it away by Kane it was four England was whipped in with pace well defended by the captain by the centre forward and France are forced back into the centre circle and give it all the way back to to goal keep out Loris long through the middle for him and then offside flag goes up against the French so free kick to England must say Jordan Henderson's covered a lot of ground in this match really good running there he says thankless that he's not gonna never gonna get the ball but he forces Larisse into an early clearance which then makes Olivier Giroud offside England win the ball back job done I hear they had six days six days off since the last matches he said to me after one of the matches I never get this with Liverpool never have these many days off in between matches England nil France won Harry Maguire and then across to John Stones Stones now takes out the pass to the right-hand side that's where Henderson is again Saka is available in field and then back to Henderson he pulls his pass in field to Declan Wright's walk-up with a touch John Stones in the centre circle France still lead by one goal to Nill it led for a long time now in the match then Stones carries it forward gives it to Henderson out there on the far side Saka makes the run Henderson finds him in the box Saka takes it on pulls it across it's cleared away by Yoko Mikano comes out Henderson hits the shot that's blocked by Ravio inside the area and France survive and actually more than survive they're taken away on the counter attack and Bappe all the pass through the middle to Shiru who takes a poor touch and it bounces the Stones and England then take possession again and look to come forward that was a waste by France brilliant Bappe pass that Shiru wasn't able to take advantage of Saka now Saka slips it into the area balling him back to Saka oh Saka is the penalty he was sent smalling Shuremeini dived in lovely footwork from the Arsenal man and this time they were denied in the first half but not in the second and England have a penalty and it's going to be Kane against Loris from the spot well there was absolutely no doubt about this one Saka did really well they've looked sharp down that right hand side since the start of second half and again he drove inside got onto his left foot too many knew he knew that as soon as he stepped across soon as he made that lunge there was very little argument from any French player and it's Tottenham versus Tottenham well this is absolutely fascinating Yugo Loris they're great friends they spend so much time together but Bappe's just going over to Loris to give him some advice I think he knows all he needs to know I think so spent so much time together wives and families on days off and they're not looking at one another Harry Kane is standing over the ball leaning forward Harry Kane this to equal Wayne Rooney's 53 goals for England stands up now shuffles back Loris steps forward huge moment in the World Cup quarterfinal Kane waits one foot in front of the other there's the whistle and the England captain just walks forward and doesn't like the way that the ball is placed on the spot you never see this you never see this he's walked forward and replaced the ball on the spot and now we'll step back again Harry Kane from the penalty spot for England against Hugo Loris up he comes right footed and drives it in it's 1-1 Kane beats Loris and it's England 1 France 1 and it's game on in front of the England fans so composed so cool to be able to stand and wait and say no it's not right I'm going to do it on my terms and he did it in a Harry Kane way the Harry Kane penalty that we've seen so many times batters it home to lorises right but England have been sharp in this second half it's been a bright start they got the reward whilst they've been playing well Loris went the wrong way dive to his left Kane fired it into the net and that means that Harry Kane draws alongside Wayne Rooney on 53 goals for England 80 caps 53 goals and power to add and now that is two goals in the knockout stages of this World Cup for Harry Kane England's record scorer from the penalty spot to his 17th goal for England but France coming forth Ravioli the shot which is dived and saved down to his left by Pickford and it just opened up for the France midfielder but Pickford kept it out fantastic run completely missed by the England backline big save from Jordan Pickford what he's expected to make but he said be ready he was alive the England defence wasn't Kane has carried the ball out of play on the halfway lane well it's opening up now Harry Kane scored his goal at the end where Juliet Farrington is watching in amongst all other photographers and Harry Kane took three puffs of breath before he fired that penalty into the back of the net he then kissed his hand and he then screamed in delight as he ran towards the corner flag to my right and then the rest of the England players just absolutely piled on to him John. England coming forward with Thornton on the left hand side taking Juliet Thornton back towards Kane Kane who's challenged good challenge as well from Ravioli and now he has Mbappe has gone with him they check back together still going shoulder to shoulder Mbappe trying to get around the outside he has he's pulled it across on his bench off Dempeli inside the penalty area however back to Griezmann Griezmann's ball across the box is straight into the path of Henderson who's able to volley it away well Walker had some triumphs in the first half but Mbappe won that one but England playing it down the left Thornton will struggle to keep that in and he can't reach it and it's out of play what a contest that was Walker and Mbappe there is the man there is the moment that a lot of these neutrals here have come to see where's the next drum free shoulder to shoulder raise it's incredible goodness me that was like you name it center and frost that's me and you John not quite but um there were quite a few horsepower at work there and Walker was beaten by him only just but he was beaten by him and actually it could easily have resulted in France retaking the lead so this is a good response from France really from from England taking them back yeah you wondered how they'd respond England responded really well to conceding and they've been on the front for ever since really they're all of a sudden England that laps the concentration the stats show the next five minutes after a goal goes in it is crucial that you do not concede because it happens so often and England have just switched off five live and BBC sounds we're across Africa on the world service it's England one France one there is a 606 phone in tonight after five live sport with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton and the winners of this match will play Morocco here on Wednesday night but it could go long but the taste and intensity of this match I mean who would bet against more goals during the course of the 90 minutes yeah it was a little bit slow a little bit passive at times when France were dictating and then France could sit in now all of a sudden it's been moments of real electricity credit to Sacher as well for the winning of the penalty yeah he's a real joy we've on this on the right hand side and he had joy moments before and maybe picked the wrong pass while driving down to the line and trying to cut it back but there did well took the extra touch Tura Manny Gamble got it wrong England one France one so Harry Kane with the equaliser from the spot the ball coming back at the England defence stones heads it forward Dalligan then nods it back into the full back position and Luke Shaw it's a long left-footed pass Griezmann heads it back into his own half per rare Harry Kane now that is eight goals at a world cup so he's two behind Gary Lennick as England record he stretches his record to 12 goals in major tournaments either European Championship or World Cup which is an England record on his own now here is Maguire passing the ball back to Golgi Bapitford where the ball it is beat it's just having a little bit of a breather after that intense first 10 minutes or so to the second great full pass to Shaw yes I think we all are Rob Green England World Cup goalkeeper watching from on high we'll hear from Michael Richards later as well who's with us here and Harry Maguire carrying the ball towards the halfway line Maguire just tapping the ball to the left Dalligan then goes back towards John Stones so even Stevens now his first meeting between England and France at a World Cup knockout match through the middle to Saka Saka now finds a position in shoots but weekly the French were closing in on all sides four of them and in the end it was a weak shot but an exciting run yeah finding real joy all over the pitch now Saka is in a central position just in the middle of midfield picked up the ball and drove he's on to his weaker foot four players virgin on him so the more comfortable safe the release here's the dangerous Griezmann oh a lovely reverse pass to Mbappe Mbappe then under pressure gives it to Dembele Dembele on his left foot shoots well that's blocked in the box by Stones and Stones has got enough on it to deflect it out for a throw down here on the right hand side Kunde kicks to Dembele Dalligan tight to him Dembele again turns Dembele and Dalligan goes with him Dembele runs away in field gives it to Mbappe and Dembele tries to work it in field that was blocked by Walker dances to Bellingham Harry Kane makes a run one way Foden makes a run four down the left Bellingham plays it into the full back position Foden holds off Kunde Foden has got it no support from there though so Foden takes it on in the middle and then back towards Bellingham there is support now Henderson centrally 30 yards out out to the right hand side Saka back to Jordan Henderson again and then Bukai Osaka taking on Theo Hernandez Hernandez just watches and then Harry Kane makes himself available and on to his left foot shoots low but weekly this time Loris is able to go down to his left and just drop on it everything is going through Bukai Osaka at the minute he has been absolutely brilliant in the second half got joy in the first half but now just taking it on a level I can take this to the French defense I can take these guys on I can dictate the play much like Griezmann was doing in the first half this is why Garry Southgate brought Saka back into the starting lineup for the previous match he said he's just being too good in training and in the matches so he can't leave him out just a really really good play The question is when the change is come who's going to come off? Here's Foden Foden forward to Bellingham then Foden again turns inside Griezmann and Foden puffs that puffs that chest out and Foden's off on the run now from inside his own half and he's fouled by Griezmann leaning into him right Griezmann who has been yellow carded already in this match commits the foul when Foden could have been away that yeah Foden's in power the referee is having none of it there's four or five England players making that exact point and I think what saves him is Olivier Giroud has a little tug then Turemene has a go and then it's Griezmann with the last one I think it's just gone his way down before which saves Griezmann well that falls into the category of if he hadn't already been booked yes he would have been booked it needs to be a strong yellow England won France won France scored in the 17th minute of the first half England equalised with Harry Kane's penalty in the 54th free kick on the halfway line referee Sam Powell says come on get on with it and that's what Harry Maguire now do it right foot at board just dropped into the full back position for Foden to be challenged by Kunde, Shaw and Kane Kaine tries to find the pass but Kunde cuts it out and now Griezmann's bringing it forward Declan Rice is there doing the job but I'm sure Garas Southgate told him to do to snuff out the danger of Griezmann puts it out for the front yeah fantastic work from Declan Rice everyone's seen it so many times for England now Kane's got real jeopardy in it opening up all over let's say Harry Kane has has really caught the eye tonight scoring the equaliser equal in Wayne Ruining's England record and at the moment though England having to defend France finding Kunde on the right hand side neither coaches made a change yet and we've played over an hour there's an overhead pass from the centre field England will happily take that it's through from Dembele for a goal kick to England face Harry Kane's penalties plenty of times and we did the work that Leriz would have done that every goalkeeper has done that has ever faced Harry Kane and we worked out if he does take it to your right hand side you've got no chance to save and he hit it that hard anyway so you may as well go to your left that's what Leriz did remember well I mean he's hit something I just unstoppable the one that he scored for his 50th goal for England in Munich in the summer in the nation's league there's an extraordinarily hit penalty past Manuel Neuer Kane on the right here he is playing the ball to Saka and Saka goes down in between two French defenders we're at for you again right there it says no free kick it did look like one and then England have penalised Henderson so they take it quickly the French greasemen England have got to settle themselves forget about it ball is played by Turemene had to the left hand side a little wiggle of the hips from Mbappe back to Turemene chips into the area beyond Giroud who falls rather awkwardly actually but it was pre-ondoned through and it's a goal kick and Saka has gone down in center field having been on the receiving end of that double challenge yeah it was a foul it was clear as day I'm not sure what a little somehow a scene but maybe a Giroud down at the other end just caught it studs in the ground I think sliding for that ball yeah it did look awkward didn't it from Giroud as he stretched for it and I think I did see him just feeling that his hand string as he was getting up Saka meanwhile is okay just there was a bit of movement on the on the side of the pitch should have been a foul Saka playing now Rabiel giving him a behind and yeah it's baffling he's right there he stood there watching the game he's in a good position yeah great position right up with the player the referee but didn't get it it's a Jordan Henderson just chatting with Saka there yeah one piece he's gonna be able to carry on because he's hobbling a bit would be a loss player that he's that he's been a man who won the penalty he's just he's just testing himself Saka on the far side Rice keeps possession for England just keeping half an eye on where the players and half an eye on Pocayo Saka England substitutes warming up down to Highlath England won France won so the semifinals on Tuesday night both seven o'clock kickoffs UK time you'll hear Argentina Croatia and then a Wednesday night Morocco against question mark after their win against Portugal earlier on the season that was an amazing listen actually I listened to the last 20 minutes or so Pat Nevin and Alistair Bruce Ball that that is one I would say go back on sounds and have a listen to the last 20 minutes or so of that was it was really quite emotional actually he has Griezmann Griezmann now with the ball in field playing the ball but that's uh it isn't intercepted by Saka it's found its way to Kio Hernandez now Mbappe 40 yards out Mbappe and works into the left hand side and then Hernandez again Mbappe more centrally Saka in front of him Mbappe finds the pass deep across the area Dembele cushions it back into the box but straight to the white shirts of England oh and then Fund does brilliantly well with what was a poor pass from Rice somehow he managed to get that ball control it turn and get it away that was almost a break dance move and a fantastic bit of control at the same time now he did that I've no idea England won France won Halle Le Bleu they're singing I haven't heard the coop back to the meson champ yet or summit and the ball just rolling away behind for a gold kick for England won the score bought the match to play penalty shootouts in both matches yesterday one meal in the earlier match I have to say Rob coming here like I said it's you in the car I felt that this would be settled in 90 minutes well you've all tightened up haven't they games they've gone along and uh yeah that game at the end and earlier for Portugal there's all hands to the bump from Morocco and Saka is being handled by Hernandez and this time the ironic cheers from the England supporters many of them in the in the seats behind the goal to our left the free kick this time sat peace for England all to the right yeah and it might be sound a bit old school but England are winning the aerial battles all over the pitch when the ball goes long and so Jordan Pickers hits a couple long Kane's won the ball and it's the second ball might sound like I'm from 1996 or before but sometimes it works for the break free kick for England on the right then it's so often in this world cup this is the fifth match they found the head of Harry McGuire but it's not ended up in the net remember the header he had against the bar in the in the opening group match for England against Iran so three kick on the right the score is one one Henderson fires it in this time oh it's just right just right in the foot of the post big chance but just wide I think he saved it no reaction of the England player says he saved it it looked like it's all kept yeah looks like he was drifting wide the Reese was covered it that's for sure but he's threatened a few times outside of the post the very outside of the post I think Maurice had that color Rob yeah got a good dive in a good time England won France won another near thing that's the second time now that McGuire has struck post all bar at this world cup Kane does extremely well looking for the run of Saka this time Hernandez gets the better of Saka by Fair means he has Rice to Henderson at the Declan Rice again looks up here's the pass long to the left hand side Ford wins the header Francis Tishor in the box shows attempted cross that was blocked by the defender who is right in front of it Rice again is there to head it down and then Harry Kane back towards the halfway line I think we can declare currently England on the better team Rob also I think out of all the quarterfinals this has been the most enthralling out of them really two good well-matched teams in terms of the interplay and players yes here is Shaw Shaw now takes it on had to look whipped to the cross oh just wide Saka was arriving Hernandez was there I think they got there almost together and the ball well the official say it was Saka who got the touch because he's been given as a gold kick I don't know I think he's making that up he doesn't know he's finally given a gold kick by luck more fun more fun than judgment he's made the right decision it's just off the inside of Saka's heel I think it may be clipped Hernandez's shin and then hit the shin of Saka as they were arriving on the edge of the six yard box and flew at an angle back across and behind and that was the right decision he's given a free kick I think foul on Hernandez in the end debatable yeah maybe the wrong decision England one France one and then upside flag against Griesen on the edge of the England penalty area and there's applause from Harry McGuire very pointedly actually which I think is making a point so uh one one it remains England involved in only the third match against France at a World Cup group match in 1966 in the famous year and like Garas Southgate I raced home from school for the match in 1982 when Brian Robson scored after 27 seconds those pick fit takes this free kick downfield and it's out of play but Saka with a challenge on Hernandez foul and that is a free kick to France 10 yards inside their own half but McCarnell to take this it's a long one but that's going nowhere for France and Jordan Tickford just takes the ball into his gloves well we've got less than 20 minutes to play so less than 20 minutes to go until extra time yeah England on the front foot in the minute there's just a moment there where McCarnell hit that ball and he just had the air of desperation about it just hitting a long hopeful ball to Olivia Giroux who was nowhere near it still neither manager has made a change which is remarkable at this World Cup here's Sean the left hand side swings a high pass across to the back post headed away by Hernandez Henderson is on to this hand is news right behind him and it's out of play Rabi actually right behind him it's out of play Torrin is taken and then Bellingham is turned in the box by Ruben McCarnell went down and he's slapping the turf Bellingham that looked more hopeful to me in terms of a penalty show well he never actually had the ball under control up on my car nose comfortable neither of them were near it so it's not a clear and obvious error Rice steps in against Griezmann Rice stretches for the header but the ball does find Griezmann this time as it comes back over the halfway line and then Griezmann to Dempeli well it was a good ball actually from Griezmann that he got his feet on Dempeli and as a result been rather labored fashion couldn't get it and it was out of play for a throwing to England back down pitch side Juliette Larrington where Steve Holland has just told Mason Mount to go and warm up and in fact he has taken his bib off so it looks like he's coming up and coming on and also an indication is that I can see in the distance a book is being clicked through so he's going to get his instruction and it looks like Mason Mount is going to be making a substitute appearance for England in the next couple of minutes or so I can see that as one won the score France come forward down the right hand side he has Dempeli on the right flank pulls it back under his left foot as he likes to do crosses into the penalty area acrobatic clearance by Walker it comes up Tremainy Rabiol together on the left hand side Rabiol then goes back to Hernandez and Hernandez has pulled to the back post a stretch but a stretch and a header wide by Olivier Giroud goal kick England Mali applauses across and it's a clever cross it's a clever bit of play from Olivier Giroud because he knew that he wasn't going to eat John Stones or Harry Maguire so I'll tell you what drift a bit further and fancied with Johnson's against Luke Short who was a little bit over here England may be making the change first but I do feel that France are the more tired of the two teams 68,895 here in Albate the stadium to the north next to where they used to do the the pearl fishing up on the coast as we've both learned in the museum of Qatar so Mason Mount coming on but not yet Maguire strides forward with the ball for England sure then to Bellingham lovely lovely control from Bellingham in the box Bellingham then back to shore sure curls it in but that's beyond anyone in a white shirt Hernandez heads it away and it comes out to him Batte who's got that lazy just look what I'm about to do to you look about him passes it forward good challenge though from Declan Rice it's been excellent in the game Declan Rice friends with the ball centrally and it's played back into central defence and then on to Griezmann and then across again to Rabiot who will carry it forward deep into the England half Batte slipped it in between two England men the cross from Rabiot to the back post D'Abele heads it across oh what a save from Tickford to keep out Sheree 10 yards out of the volley and Tickford diving to his left to his right pushes it away wider the goal and behind for a corner huge moment in the game fantastic save really well worked and it's the moment Olivier Sheree has been waiting for a volley on his left foot he's held his time in the penalty area just waiting and waiting and waiting it's a big big save huge on his 50th cap Tickford here's the corner though headed away then he approached for England by Kane comes out for Varan and it's worked to the left hand side and still up for the set piece here's the ball in Sheree this time 2-1 France 6 yards out super powerful centre forwards and England are behind the game in the quarterfinal and France are going mad England have got to do it all again and now time's running out England 1 France 2 it's a wonderful and it's from that man Griezmann right from the touch line fires in a wonderful cross and Olivier Sheree he's made that run a million times in his career across the near post and he's asking for that ball giving himself hardly out of space please just find me just find me and he does it to perfection steals in takes a little nick of Harry Maguire that Pete Tickford they had the warning in England they didn't listen they've got to do it again as you say and here's the change now Henderson is off Jordan Henderson makes way for Mason Mount who comes on into the midfield and Raheem Sterling as well is going to come on for England so a double change so Jordan Henderson is off and it is Bukaj Osaka it must be that problem because otherwise you wouldn't be taking Bukaj Osaka off the match that he's had no he wouldn't needing them now to create something so to creative influences out there this is a surprise though isn't it that it's Sterling and not Rashford well he's fresh say that having been at Holman back back down to Juliet Flarrington well it could soon well be Marcus Rashford making an appearance because he's now just going through a war walk on his own the Raheem Sterling substitution John that was a very quick substitution which was being made all being discussed about whilst that corner was being taken but Marcus Rashford now is doing a warm-up so maybe he will be England's third substitution into this game so Mason Mount is on having come on as a substitute in the previous match against Seneca all but I think Jordan Henderson the amount of ground that he's covered today I think it was almost an inevitability that Mount would come on for him in the midfield yep with that creativity that he has we Zinglin need that right now I wonder how France will approach it now with just over 10 minutes ago here's one over the top for England oh that's a that's a strong third challenge from Hernandez and I mean as the run was made by Mount into the penalty area there seemed to be a shove on his back he went down not given and England aren't happy about that Steve Hollander's up on the edge of the coaching area they want the referee to have a look at that on VAR Harry McGuire saying the same thing Declan Rice too the referee is waiting Hernandez he came in with well quite a shove in the back but the body into his back and I think VAR is taking over and having a look at this for another possible penalty for England but it's clumsy at best and Hernandez has no inclination of playing the ball Mason Mount isn't anywhere near the ball himself but the contact is there the intent is there and he hits him clean in the back we're waiting we're waiting this is a huge moment England two one down France oh here's the rectangle and France look to the skies their players they know what's coming here Hernandez it was a poor challenge into the back of Mason Mount who is making his run into the area the referee now is out of our sight hopefully now we're seeing the pictures and that does look like a blatant shove in the back of Mason Mount in the area it's a gift it's a gift it is absolutely it's a disaster but Hernandez if this is given because Mason Mount has no chance of playing the ball Wilton Stamphow is standing in front of the television screen hands on his hips here he comes there's the rectangle again he points to the spot and for the second time in the match it's going to be Harry Kane against Hugo Lloris to level things up and the 82 minutes on the clock and tube diagram has gone with the referee to the penalty spot and I think that is suggesting that perhaps that could be a red card for Hernandez you know Mason Mount is in there in the penalty area and the referee now is now rather blatantly producing a yellow card for Hernandez well I don't see it denying a clear goal scoring opportunity because Mason Mount never had control of the ball Lloris was going to be the favorite to win it but as I said it's an absolute disaster for Hernandez what he's thinking why he needs to do it I have no idea it's straight in the back of him Mason Mount bundled over in the box we're here again penalty again and this this is now for Harry Kane to top the list on his own but that is a side issue what is more important here is that with 83 minutes on the clock now that England need this England need this to level up this quarter final and again it's the same routine remember how last time he re-spotted it and again Lloris is looking down at the ground with his hands on his knees in the goal and Harry Kane is not looking at him if ever England needed Harry Kane it's now time running out the world champions are leading this to level it up Harry Kane waits Lloris on his line he sent him the wrong way last time we're waiting for the whistle still waiting this needs the nerve of the coolest man on the field oh he's put it over the bar he's missed it Harry Kane has landed the ball in amongst the England fans and France celebrate as though they themselves have scored it remains England one France two and Harry Kane is consoled by Mason Mount he runs his fingers through his hair he can't believe it England can't believe it the golden chance to equalise has gone and France continue to lead with six minutes to play and that that could be decisive that moment could be the moment that sees England out of this world cup and Thornton is being replaced now by Marcus Rashford Robdream what a moment what a moment same routine that we've seen Harry Kane do so many times throughout his career and he just gets it wrong he hits under the ball it clears the bar by a distance the Reese is going the right way he's gone for the height I think he knows that the Reese is going to guess it he's done it so many times throughout his career for Tottenham and for England it's such a crucial moment well the question is is that it can England respond to that with only minutes left five minutes of the 90 England one France two Marcus Rashford is now on the field Marcus Rashford England's joint top scorer at this world cup England coming forward but that's that's given us a foul for France a free kick for France against Duke Ellingham and and clearly here France will take as long as they can Kunde is getting to his feet after being on the receiving end of that and France trying to wind the clock down now as you would expect that they would what a reprieve what a reprieve from France haven't been the best aside in the second half had five minutes of pressure created two chances took one and in England the opportunity long and forward from Laurie Spanches across the England penalty area and the choirs able to get there just ahead of Bappy inside the box back to Walker Walker is tricked by Laurie so that's a free kick to England Walker looks over his shoulders jaggers at the at the huge figure of Olivier Giroud so France still lead through that brilliant header from Giroud from a brilliant ball in from Driesman but the story I'm afraid it's going to be penalties again isn't it for England at a major tournament but this time not a penalty shootout and Harry Kane who has missed penalties that's the fourth one he's missed for England but the most costly there's Mason Mount is fouled on the right hand side there will be a 606 on five live tonight to take your calls Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton hashtag dvc 606 and the TV highlights are on BBC one five live World Cup daily podcast as well to download in the morning with all of the reaction but we will get you the live interviews on from down in the dressing room area and at the moment those interviews are going to be downbeat downcast England players free kick for England still time ball headed across the box by McGuire clear away by France comes back to McGuire might have been stood by Kunde referee says no balling him with a two but that's out for a throwing a throwing for England well if we've seen anything in this World Cup it is injury time and there will be plenty of it so England just have to compose themselves don't need to rush it it's just seen them launch one into the box needs to back ourselves to create one big chance rice now back to Dalingham and then in field the Mason Mount the Mason Mount makes room for himself and shoots gracefully from 25 yards there were options inside the box but he liked the look of it now he went for it but it was the wrong decision why yeah you can see why he went for it by just thinking the reason the form he's been in tonight the options are there use them he just skips up in front of him high and handsome into the crowd but it's the same England have that belief that you'll always get one more chance in a game and just keep digging out the possession keep recycling it keep creating the opportunities by the way in the midst of all of one of those dramas France brought on Coleman for Demperre which is Didier Deschamps first change and now there's been a challenge by Maguire and it's a free kick and the it's happened in the eye line of the bench and I think that's going to be a yellow card for Harry Maguire it is which is England's first yellow card of this World Cup but goes the card now and a free kick for France is an aerial challenge he led with his arm his forearm on Driesman you just need to balance out the desperation to win the ball back to being over assertive because you know every opportunity is going to be taken kill the game slow it down England won France 2 the holders are going through into the semi-finals to play Morocco England are going out at the quarter-finals Varan long and right footed towards the edge of the box it's headed across and Bapé takes that down tried to turn Stoenstead a good job on him prevented him from doing that very very dangerous for a moment Walker then up towards Sterling who chested in field Sterling is on for this it's a 50-50 now Sterling goes into it with them Bapé the ball bounces in field France have got it back and then there's a challenge from Mason Mount just too much adrenaline I think in on that one too much force on Rabiot and it's a free kick to France on the left clever from Rabiot just got his body in the way just went down eight minutes Rob about a time still time still time England won France 2 so Argentina against Croatia and with this scoreline it will be Morocco against France the last four England I've got to come up with a late late show just to take this to extra time feels like a tall order and at the moment the taller order because Griesman standing over the ball on the left hand side and Griesman's free kick is headed away by Rashford on the edge of the box knotted back in by Rabiot England will clear through McGuire it's away from Kane in the centre circle France have got it Hernandez Hernandez back out to Griesman who heads it forward and Bapé is onto this he gets there ahead of Walker Walker stands off it any other corner flag and Bapé taking on Walker goes to the fire line the support coming as well and that support is good from England and from Raheem Sterling and Rice will carry it away but he's under pressure still in the England right back area this is in added time at the end of this World Cup quarterfinal up to the centre circle Kane does well to win the header to Rashford back to Kane now the space for Shaw white shirts are pouring forward for England Shaw with the cross into the back post Laurie stretching whether he got a touch for that or not I'm not sure he did it's a corner to England from the right Rob Green yep better from England just that bit of composure on the ball from Harry Kane allowed the space found the space to get the Ries taking no chances Harry McGuire denied by the woodwork twice in the tournament now is your time so corner to England from the right to one France lead Harry Kane's second missed penalty making the difference here's the corner in but it's headed away for France well headed away by Upo McCarno comes out to Sterling Sterling steers it back to Walker they're staying up two minutes of the eight have been added on Bellingham comes short Bellingham turns gives the ball to the right hand side England need to come up with what would be that 14th goal of this World Cup Sterling with the cross Laurie's comes in next to catch outside the penalty area McGuire's claiming he was fouled I think that's hopeful to think that England could get another penalty on the AR well should have had three we're gonna get a third of now just one little bit of hope in the ball in wasn't the bodies the concentration it was McGuire on his own so uh France take this ball downfield Kingsley Coleman Big Shaw was able to get back and then the ball was run away by Declan Rice Coleman chasing him and he forced him to play it out of play so that is a throw into the French by Bellingham saying should it be England's throw the referee says firmly no it is Francis and Tumani will leave it to Cunde to turn so two one France lead Tumani gave France the lead early on in the match England equalised in the second half through the Harry Kane penalty Olivier Giroud's header struck France back in front and then the crucial moment it would seem when England won a second penalty given on the AR but Harry Kane struck it over the top of the crossbar Sterling Sterling curls one forward Hernandez heads it away Mason Mount chasing Dyingham's in there as well but Hernandez just goes long hits it long that's one from back eight to chase John Stones gets there first three minutes almost four minutes about a time there are only four minutes to play four minutes to take this to extra time right to McGuire McGuire now to the left hand side watch your belief like England watch your hunger like Bellingham swinging it for the right hand side they've got to find a way past the world champion Sterling on the right Sterling with the cross to the back post sure is that the headed back across didn't get enough on it was under pressure only half headed away by Cunde England still putting pressure on McGuire now to the left hand side to shore goes for the early cross to close the lorries and he's able to come forward in spectacularly captured takes a great cross all to the ground gets the applause gets the congratulations from his teammates the thanks that kills some more seconds and it has been hopeful from England in this injury time almost five minutes of added time played only three minutes to go England have got to just go for it actually John Stones has has gone the ground having taken a knock in the challenge with Olivier Giroux and he might have had his left foot stood on and you know urgency is important for England but Stones can't can't get up just and he's still down receiving treatment just how fallen his foot awkward so the the medical men have been waved on by the time John Stones receives his treatment here and there has to be a question whether he's going to be able to continue in this match because the way that he's gone down that's good andi julia thurington tick site jack realish is going to come on to the pitch john he's ready to got his shirt on and he's ready to come on for England i'm not too sure if that is going to be for john stones but another substitution is going to be made by England and it is jack realish who is going to enter the final few minutes of this match if that's all i obviously say is the over six minutes of being played stretcher is has got halfway under the field and actually england are saying kind of walker are saying to the stretcher bearers to turn around and go back off the field and john stones is back on his feet now i mean there's only seconds to play in the match and whether he's able to move on it he's now walking he's looking down at the ground the the physios are either side of him he's going to have to leave the field realish still waiting to come on and from an england point of view they have to hope that this time is added on the play will resume with a drop ball in the centre circle it would seem jack realish is being waved on stones is still off the field on the far side and it is stones who is going to be substituted so central defender off jack realish on there are only seconds left for him to influence the game well if it does get to extra time let's worry about the shape and the positions of everybody after because we need to do something fast yeah drop ball the ball is played back to ugo lorries france lead by two goals to one there are only seconds left in this quarterfinal the ball finds its way to and batte on the left wing and batte is going to take it down towards the corner flag and then he's fouled by sterling just a trip no he's not he threw himself down and the referee's not buying it it's out and it's a goal kick and this is probably the last attack the eight minutes are almost up pickford strikes this long downfield it had to go long it was flicked on rashford's chasing it cleared away comes back to belliger ravioli the challenge middle of the french half hooked forward by mount sterling this is the last attack of the match the french fans are urging the brazilian referee to blow the whistle rice back to sterling again sterling pulls it onto his left foot he's got to go into the penalty area sterling to the right hand side bill belliger now back to rice rice goes out towards the right wing here's the cross into the box to rashford heading away by forrand comes out to maguire who's fouled on the d on the edge of the box he was clumsily and awkwardly fouled by germany by colman and it's a three kick to england right on the edge of the d and it's now and ever this is it and it's something out of nothing because the chance of god he felt harry maguire's created something well this is very close rob this is very close to where rashford scored his free kick against wales left of center maybe slightly closer yep you're looking at it you said someone like rashford the way he's support tending to think it doesn't suit him to be that bit closer to the goal the recent man of his experience will not be taking a gamble he'll hold his ground but we are beyond added time we're in the 10th minute of added time england won france two this is the drama of the world cup these are moments that we will remember for years and years matches like this moments like this and it all comes down to this france have put up their wall hernandez is lying behind it the stage is set under the floodlights here at alpache it's marcus rashford with england's last chance to take this quarter final next for time rashford steps back and he's ready now and he waits and marcus rashford with his right foot from the free kick oh just right just right at the top corner agony it caught the stanchion at the back of the goal and it bounced down lorries could only watch and it was france who breathed a sigh of relief it's a goal kick and i think this will be it it is it is friends are through the holders are into the semi finals again and garrison date looks to the skies and thinks of what might have been french celebrations england go out in the quarter finals here in catar and england's players england's players look at the ground and harry came him it's all on his own the england captain the big moment the huge moment he took responsibility with that penalty that he sent over the top of the crossbar he's inconsolable now his team mates are going to him and are trying to say the right things are trying to find the right words but really everyone knows nothing will do here and there must be tears down there it's tears again for england it was at the end of the final last year against italy that was a penalty shoot out and again at a major tournament this time at a world cup it's penalties again but in this case one scored by harry came and one missed by harry came and england are out and down the pitch side and juliet farrington well the england players harry came's team mate politely asked for the camera operators who are on the pitch trying to obviously grab every picture every shot that they could to to move away from harry came because he was inconsolable jude belligan had his shirt over his face he was lying on his back before he got back up onto his feet but when rashford's free kick went over harry came pan and you as you were saying in your commentary that was that he looked up into the skies in indisperate and was just trying to take it all in i'll just i'll just jump in there because garrow south gate has gone around all of the drench players and now he's moving to the england players and bakayosaka out there and now garrow south gate goes across to harry came and he embraces him and the two speak words together and now they hook together and harry came has garrow south gate slapping on the back and talking to him and it's like history repeating itself this last year it was garrow south gate consoling bakayosaka after his miss penalty and this year it's garrow south gate consoling harry came after his miss penalty and this is garrow south gate who famously missed a penalty of his own for england at the end of euro 96 that put england out of the tournament penalties penalties penalties england won france two and france celebrating as england commiserate mark chappan while some things are the same rob green there are other elements that aren't and it's very difficult to find fault with any aspect of england this evening and even if you go back to the euro's final there were criticisms about substitutions you know tactics etc manchini changing things did south gate that was all back then people may correct me but i can't think of anything to criticising england over this evening it was a fantastic performance they got rocked by an early goal they faced a team that were coming up with answers and problems for england early on and they answered those and they got around it and they responded and they came back into the game and for the life of me i'm still not sure as to why it wasn't a penalty in the first half but they still went they got back into the game they had more shots in france they had more possession than france the only thing i would say is that they had the warning from the chance from elivia jiru to say you can't leave this guy's space and they did a second time and they were punished and it was a moment of real quality from one of the standout players of the evening greaseman for the cross for the goal which was one of the moments of the game if i could give anybody the ball to take a penalty now you'd give it to harry kane and it's that is football that is the captain he is the penalty taker and he is there to miss and it happened and you would not begrudge any of the england players because they've all played their part and it was a really really good performance from them tonight i'm just uh i'm just watching the uh the sort of media it's all media scroll it's it's england staff and uh itv waited to do the interviews of course um and harry kane went straight down the tunnel understandably um no surprise that jordan henderson then steps up to do that interview we will get our own interviews as well they're cutting a disconsolate bunch understandably as they trudge down the tunnel jack greelish one of the last to go john stones as well jude bellingham may well be the last player off the field along with bakaya sakka and that may be mason mount as well it is mason man they're the final three but bellingham and sakka can have absolutely no complaints about the world cups the day of hard um mika you know we will we will look at different things we will look at the penalties we'll look at the goals conceded but overall overall as a group there's 26 players and there's a manager and there's a coaching staff they should be holding their heads up i can't believe the player the march by the way has gone to elivia asia rea and not grease them in the stadium but um inland of inland have got nothing to to be um well they've got everything to be proud about yeah of course i think that's the the word i was going to use that they should be proud of their performances um in this world cup a lot of people talked about in the group they've not faced anyone and they can only be what's in front of but today i've seen a resilient england i've seen them come back from when they'd suffered adversity in the game um they mixed up the play at times they never gave up but it was just the crucial moments in the game which i couldn't get over the line um i'm proud of every single one of them players tonight because the game was such in the balance and when we talked to before the game about where's this game going to be won you know i i did say individually that the french players are better just because of i watched them week in week out and i think sometimes we can be snobby to other leagues because we watched the premier league and i don't think england necessarily was was the worst team today i don't i i can really say that but it's just in the moments they made it count and we didn't and that was a difference in the game today rob said it more shots more possession but goals win your games and unfortunately they couldn't put enough in today they got they know they've got away with them they're celebrated there like like that that was a win like they couldn't dream of with that penalty as they gave away that penalty and it was it was something they couldn't have got away with and they had two big moments in the two periods of play in the game where they were on top and they scored from them both now that's a sign of a really good side england had far more moments where they were on top and couldn't capitalise the thing is with the the the french player and we've got julien coming in in a minute but it's all about the big moments isn't it you know we can talk about how good our players have performed tonight but we talked about world-class players and druid was sort of swept aside he's too old he's not good enough for the premier league he goes over to italy has a fantastic season becomes france all-time gold scorer and delivers in the big moments and unfortunately we couldn't find it in our boys today but they still come proud of their performance as mike says uh sheela and aran has uh has joined us kind of snuck in slightly sleep sheetishly on the end of that row in many ways this this is this is probably a harder 50 minutes for you than if you'd lost where you'd have probably felt more comfortable comfortable sitting with us it was a horrible yeah it was a horrible second half i think england have been the better side i have to be honest here england were better especially in that second half and there was there was a moment where you were so so much better that you should have capitalised and you didn't and to go back to what rob said if you don't kill a team like us if you don't kill a team like france when you can when the when that team is on the floor then he might come back to haunt you and that's exactly what happened there's no way we can play that game another nine times and england would win nine times even even without the can penalty england could have won should have won that game it's just that a team like france with that kind of experience with the kind of players like grisman and jihru even with an mbappin no eyes no in a no in a good then well defended owned by walker and stones and hand the sand if you don't if you don't put us down then that can happen you would say as well that laryse was one of the better players which tells the story in itself and you turn around and say again it's it's you cannot fault the england team you can't it's just those moments let's um let's get some reaction we'll get reaction throughout the course of the evening we can now hear from jordan henderson you know straight after the game it's difficult to find the right words um i thought we'd give everything in the game you know disappointed to go one no down but i thought the character and the mentality to keep going in in the second half and find the equalizer so i can't see any more really you would give it everything and unfortunately it wasn't ever enough very difficult for them to do the interviews after an evening like that matt upson joins us as well um you've heard what rob and miker and jewels have said just just opening for a new you would agree would you i i would um unfortunately i mean i think england were were great bar the first 15 minutes i thought that it took us that long to get into the game in terms of believing that we're a team that could go and beat france i don't think we started the match like that um but then we grew into it game control got confident started to realize that we can match france in a lot of different ways and maybe even beat them and that's how it felt and it was just key moments in the game i mean i go back to to miker's point about them having better players than us it's almost like a they have the arrogance and the belief because they are serial winners on this level we're not and i think that we're kind of trying to develop that and trying to grow that maybe you have to actually something has to fall from you have to win something for it to really happen um but they've just got this edge in moments in the game where the piece of quality comes in there in the right place at the right time and it's clinical there's the there's no second chances um and i have to credit france for being outstanding at that but i thought we were we were brilliant on the night and it's just such a shame that we couldn't see it through i thought that the team were excellent i thought harry cayne was excellent forget that you know the goal of the panel the penalty miss i thought his contribution was outstanding i mean upper man khan i had no clue how to handle him um and for me the referee was was was appalling i thought it was terrible the referee some really bad decisions and and that didn't help either i think you've nailed it matt and there was a moment in the second uh at the second goal for france where greezman got the ball and you saw the gap that ollie jiru had and you went oh no and you knew that that moment that it was there for the taking we had a number of moments like that where jiru tell me tell me tell me if i'm wrong but probably more moments in the game where you'd go oh no yeah completely and we didn't yeah we didn't take it and that's that's the difference for as much as you say that though rum i i totally agree with what you're saying i just always felt like france were always in the game if england would have lifted it if they would have scored i felt like france could have scored as well every time i made you feel like that mike i just feel like i just believe and bap he he didn't have his greatest game today but when he did his little touches in his flicks and he created the space for others it just seemed like if they needed a goal it could come as well and i know england were the better team but i just think when i was watching them going forward i was honestly i had about 10 mini heart attacks every time and bap he was nailed the ball because he creates so much for the team we talked about greezman and we talked about the matchups no no one's been talking about greezman the performance he had today was one of the best performances i've seen at this world cup the ball for the for the for the second goal we're thinking it's red and butter for for a high maguire that's what he loves in there but it was pinpoint and we go back to what we said in the in the build-up as well those clutch games there you need to learn how to win them this is not a given you don't you don't just work up i work up quarter finals semi final and just against the big nation the nation that's been there before the world champions not always the steal and then go and win if you know almost 100 perfect in in every sense defensively offensively in midfield in your substitutions because i don't understand why bukayo sake came off today for rames telling who's been away for five days i really this one i don't think that the field is on south gate that's not what i'm saying but sake was one of england's best player in that second half he got the penalty that got you back into the game and then you took him off for someone who's been back in london for the last five days that didn't i didn't really get that however to win games like this you need to have everything almost perfect and the french were far from it but i think that kind of experience and the know-how helps them massively because to go back to what i said earlier when you miss chances after chance they believe is growing at the same time as you're missing chances and they think you know what they don't take their chances if we have one we will take it and that's what we did i think sake was injured but uh for that i don't think he got back in but i do think okay maybe i didn't i know we don't we don't know anyway but maybe no but he was fantastic tonight as an individual performance you win a tournament by like this not by being the best team but by winning when you aren't the best team and that's what france did tonight it was interesting that we were talking a lot of them before the game about that the the midfield and how they're going to cope with the with the defensive and those adjustments and i thought the first goal was a little bit of a representation of that we got a little bit deep we got torn deca and rice tried to make the tackle on an unbap pay and then we sat back so we weren't out high enough to get pressure on the ball it was a brilliant strike but i just felt that midfield we again that fine detail that the juniors talking about there we were just five yards off it chappers and in in a game like this you know what that moment of quality you get punished um that discussion matt though between uh experience and winning mentality and belief that they are all slightly different aren't they because there was there was absolutely no doubt that england believed for the well 100 minutes in the end there i i i never you know they were on the front foot for the majority of the time i know i keep going back to it but it but it feels like a very different defeat to me to many of the others that i've done over the last you know 20 years of going to world cup that that was that was a side that did believe probably until probably until we went into stoppage time and john stones going off and all of that i i thought they were positive but there's a difference there between belief and experience and and winning mentality and an execution of that and i think that that's something i mean i i didn't like i said i i didn't think the first 15 minutes we started quite high enough with that and it wasn't until after the first goal that i thought we'd really reacted and came into our own and then started to play with that that presence and that purpose and and the belief a bit more but you know i think we're talking a little bit about about execution of of these things so when you get into that area you work so hard like england did to create these chances and it's just that fine detail whether that does come down to like what mike is saying about the quality whether they are a bit better than us in certain areas and having that that quality of player perhaps it is that but both goals i thought defensively we could have done you know harry maguire once that ball gets played out for the second phase of a set piece you're only looking for a juror don't worry about anything else no one in the box the space doesn't matter where is he am i the right side am i physically up against him so he can't head the ball and just those little those little details just went the other side um you know it's a real shame it's a difficult difficult watch actually but that's that's that's matt on that just on that on the from a defender's point of view i'll bring mike green after either what we're taught well and i suppose it's elite sport isn't it but we're talking fine margins because yeah gerud to create the space for himself fantastic the ball was absolutely unbelievable so it it's not as if an england centre half got themselves caught under it or necessarily got really pulled away by by by a run everything from the french point of view was perfect for that goal but but chappers there's a centre back playing for him you'd expect that tonight wouldn't you would you expect anything different from juror or greaseman you wouldn't so so your position has to be absolutely spot on and you have to make that quick decision in the box to say where's juror where's my man like forget the space forget anyone else he's the person that's going to hurt us here i need to go and physically lock in against him and it's later on in the game however many what minute was that 78th minute nearly 80 minutes gone you know the the cut the focus and the concentration is all there and i think just those tiny little moments and whether that is tournament winning tournaments knowing how to you know we talk about that perhaps that's what that is in a nutshell just getting those things right and making sure you either score or don't concede in in those incidents like it yeah i would i would agree with with what matt's saying um i think you know looking at it you know when people talk about that the fine no margins in in football that's what juror does and that's what i was worried about in the game you know everyone was talking about in batting batting no you know everyone's got to focus on their individual battles and unfortunately and a split second and we took you know you you play sunday league chapters and you play regular you play that a decent decent level and you might have three seconds to think about when a ball comes in maguire might have a second and a half and and that's the the level that we were talking about and juror didn't have a good game today he stretched us and he tried to stay high didn't win that many headers but he comes alive in the box and unfortunately for maguire it wasn't really a mistake but it was just the know-how from juror where to be at the right time sometimes it's just that i had 15 seconds to wait for a ball to be a don't worry about that still not myself under underneath it on the backside with the striker scoring anyhow matt sorry now it mike is right because it's a it's a tiny fraction the ball actually comes off maguire into the goal drew heads it and then it hits it is that close to him that it's a half the yard of that fraction and and we are talking such fine margin on all of these things you know the tackle from hananda's where sure crosses the ball and you think foden's going to arrive and or was it sacked we think it was sacked was going to score you know tiny tiny margins and sometimes they go your way sometimes they don't but there must be something behind why they go your way more and i think that that's you know that's what we're talking about that's the kind of difference in that fine detail jiru is 36 years old 36 and in a game of of this caliber of that level iizaj to still be alive and score that goal there after 18 minutes where he's had nothing apart from the one just before where it's not about i think it's a good save for big first but it's said that you expect him to make it went with his instep he should have probably come with his the volley actually with you sorry are you telling it on the jiru how to volleyball i just said he would have explained what he did but yet with nothing almost in that game he kept believing and waiting for that ball to come and when grisman delivered there it was perfect and it still amazes me even even after all those years rob played with him i've been his friends for 12 years and still on a game like this where i think he might not be good enough tonight because he's too the opposition is too strong it's too good it would be isolated it would be this and yet he found a way to impact the game in that way i just find it incredible well not only that but he was on for the whole time at 36 having having started no he didn't start the the final group game did he tune his game no no yeah so having having played every other game at this woke up he does some of mbappe's running and pressing for him when mbappe maybe comes inside and jiru then goes out wide to do and and there wasn't one ball that went long towards i this ingrid center half from lorice that he didn't compete for i mean i know i'm slightly surprised he got player of the match because yeah i thought i mean i thought grisman bossed it when he needed to but as you say for a man of that age and his france is all-time leading male goal scorer as well and yet it still feels like he doesn't get the credit yeah and four years ago at the world cup that we won he didn't he didn't score a single goal and i think he got a love stick for it and people don't really understand what else he brings if they don't see him scoring which is strange but you can repeat it they still don't get it and for him to be here now with four goals i think after after what happened four years and four years older as well it's just it's just remarkable the mental strength that he had and we don't have to go back again to how difficult the star of his career had been because nobody believed him we said that already when he broke the when he broke the record but still to be there and play like the only time he panicked was the last the last clearance where he messed it up and then i led to the rashford free kick and i think you could see on his face he was like please don't score now because i messed up he should have hit the ball literally to south arabia not even in this stadium but but that's the only thing really that you can have against him tonight incredible difference i wonder rob as as jul says you you know him you've been in teams with him i wonder whether as we said pre-match with jordan henderson being at a stage of your career where you don't have to prove anything to anybody you've won everything that there is to win you know how good you are your teammates know how good you are just go and play football yeah and that's exactly just go and play football that's what he's done we said before that he could have stayed at chelsea and not played and he still made the choice to go and play because he wanted to play here he's a goal away from being the top scorer in the tournament now and it's remarkable that he could nick it off in baffled by the time the final comes and i think his longevity yes but he's just his willingness to keep doing the same things because he knows they're right and it's either being a good teammate it's either sticking in there when it's not going for you like to not or just making that run making the run across the near post like he has done so many times and the knowledge of how to do it he might not be quick in the feet he certainly is in the mind and just that moment there he said to him tell him go on put it there and he did and you knew what the outcome would be and that's what it is and that's the sign of a great striker now people may not like him people might this stats say he's a great striker there is here he's on the pitch he's just scored the winner in the quarter final of a world cup six weeks ago he's not on the squad he's not in the squad he's not on the plane Deshaun doesn't have him in the squad he has benzema he's got Killian he's got youngsters behind like a turam or colomani those kind of guys there's no and kunku but there's no leave your zero on his list and it's very late that i think Deshaun thought am i really gonna not gonna take him in here for everything that he can bring even off the bench because carin benzema would have started tonight had he been fit had he been with us here and yet now when we look at it it was like there was no way you can not bring someone like him in your squad at the world cup for all the reason that we've just explained on to an greaseman my cut now has 28 assists for france that's the most of any player for the national team over the last 50 years so he's gone ahead of tiari on re and zinedine zidane who are both on 26 so tiari on re's lost the goal scoring andy andy in the sem one good month for him terrible terrible world cup for tiari on re very terrible i'll be texting him after as well just pick that name up i didn't i didn't say it i just said i'll be texting him but no yeah i mean greaseman east east at the tempo from the first half the best player in the first half he got into little pockets of space he slowed it down when he needed to he released the ball at the right time the weight of his pass was excellent and he kept driving him on why he liked about you know he's worked great he picked up a yellow card i thought them belly worked really hard today as well but greaseman's just got a calmness when he's on the ball the way he turns and the way he plays excellent let's go jump in we can get some reaction to that england performance car walker is with john morray yes the the first man out is the the senior man in the squad actually who's come to speak to us kyle walker um kyle you've just come out of the dressing room there just gives an idea of what the feeling is obviously it's down it's quiet it's disappointment but as you just said there you know one of the senior ones and i've been here unfortunately before um for club and country where the the result hasn't gone your way and it's about you know it's about taking responsibility i feel that we've all done what we needed to do to get to this point we come against the world champions which is a good team but it's about making sure that the differences in both bots you know we obviously a lot of shots more than them but they scored two we lose a game and that's the game of football incredibly fine margins aren't there between two good teams i think that's the perfect way to to say it's fine margins it's a chess game um i think you've seen some of the results that we've seen over the last couple of days that you know it's either penalties or the going right to the wire um listen we would have loved to have sung in our way i think that we have played well there's no way to feel ashamed about how we've gone out there obviously we would have wanted to go to the semi-final and possibly the final you know because i thought it was a great chance but it is what it is it's football we have to dress ourselves down and like i've just said on the radios and tv's there it's a fantastic bunch of lads to work with that's the manager and staff included and the future's bright you know you got the likes of Phil Ford and Jude Bellingham obviously Marcus Rush was so very young you know these players have got to lead the way for the younger generation that's going to come through and you know we look forward to the euros log and tell us how Harry Kane is you have not seen him come out yet you know took responsibility but do you think that the fact it was Harry Kane against Loris was a factor no no not whatsoever i mean harry kane faces ramsdale pulp and pickford in the premier league and nine times out of ten he puts them away you know that's that's how he's one of harry's jobs and one of harry's specialities you know in penalties but he's put one in the back of the net and then you know he's put one over it eats football would i have wanted anyone else on that penalty no not one bit i feel that he's proving himself and we shouldn't even be questioning him on that it's a it's a penalty you can miss or you can score that's the simple thing about it he's put one away in his miss one let's not dwell on it let's move forward i'm sure he'll be back and i know he will be back in fact because that's the type of character that he is and the leader it is on and off the field and we just look forward to the euros now kyle thanks very much for coming and talking to us thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you john real emotion in car walkers voice and actually my career as you can see from from where we are here this is the hard we've talked every game about the england players coming out to see their families afterwards and how nice it is and lots of smiles and stuff i tell you what down there at the moment and a few of the england players have come out i can just see jack greelish coming out now there are a lot of kids needing a lot of cuddles from their dads down there as the england players come out let's go back to the tunnel though elivier jiroux is live with john murray yes it's the other side of the the story now with elivier jiroux who scored elivier an absolute classic center forwards header to win them to win the quarterfinal wasn't it yeah yeah definitely a good cross from anton was ready in a box he put the ball where i expected it so yeah the right place at the right time if i can say and i'm very proud for this team you know we put so much effort in the game to to keep the results and unfortunately they they came back in a game they were pushing very very hard you know to win this game but we kept our team cohesion solidarity generosity you know to to keep believing in ourselves and we knew that we we would have some more chances to score i had the opportunity just before the game just before the goal with a nice head head back to from musman i tried to just put it on a target but pick for the made a good save and i knew that i was praying for a minute a second to get another one and well god's plan it gave me the chance to put it back off the net and i'm very grateful and i'm very proud for my country just one more thing because i know you're in demand could you believe it that harry came didn't score that penalty uh always believe always believe like my orthobiography i think you never know in football um he tried to hit it hard you know and maybe uh yeah we were lucky and this penalty but you know it's football um after we were we were strong one more time all together but yeah you have to say that england play a very good game and i would like to tell them that uh we were we are very proud to be a very strong team of england alivia ishary thank you very much thank you bon chance in the semi-final okay him uh that was a nice interview from alivia ishary although have you been giving him tips on how to plug a book at any given opportunity he was yeah he was wasn't he yeah yeah was that you mike or is that what you've been telling him no no that's not me today i'm not getting blamed for that today 08 085 nano 9 693 uh 606 is on the way uh and follows us but go just going back to those scenes miker down there they're as i said there are a lot of kids who are needing hugs down there it's um it's more than just losing a football match for the friends and the families yeah i mean everyone wants to see their their families and i think a couple of the families have been out as well some for the the whole tournament and you know it's devastating you can't really put into words how you feel because the euros final when we went one ahead against italy and then we we dropped deep and the the sort of opinion was everything was too negative but no one can say this was negative today this is all positive and you know the group that they've got that being brilliant the the played the socks off the try to win the game was it meant to be and i just love the characters of all the players i think the interviews that they give the so articulate they're so helpful and you just wanted them to go that step further just because the role great lads but i'm sure they're all happy to uh to go home to their families now i just hope that people back in england don't see this as a setback this kind of of course is not as good as a semi-final or a final of the euros but this can't be seen as a setback this can't be seen maybe maybe because of where you're going to go home from the quarter finals but in the progression and development that we were talking with rob about before this is a learning this has to be part of the learning curve for what is still a very young team so it's so i tell you what will go back down and then we'll explore that a little bit more but kara southgate is now live with john yes kara southgate is here commiserations garith how are they how's harry ken how are you uh look the uh it's a incredibly quiet dressing room as you'd expect um what i've said to them is that not only have they played incredibly well against the top top top team tonight and gone toe to toe all the way and really deserved more from the game um but that's how they've been across the whole tournament and the entire squad the entire staff have been brilliant for me to lead um i think we've improved as the tournament's gone on i think we've shown a different side to ourselves than perhaps we've seen in the past um and that was shown tonight and yeah i can't the word's difficult because it hurts tonight it's you were years in preparing and uh building for a world cup and of course it's uh yeah to go out in the way we have is is really cruel does it almost feel unjust you know last year you finished with bukayo sake in your arms and here you finish with harry kane in your arms miss penalties your own history with penalties it really seems unfair almost doesn't it that sport yeah it's part of football and um we we are a team and we've won as a team and we we lose as a team and across the hundred minutes there are many things that were really really good and a lot of things that weren't so good and that's how the the game ends up with the score line that it does so it's not about one chance that was missed or one goal that was conceded um there's been a tremendous collective all the way through we wouldn't be where we are without harry's leadership and his goals frankly so i don't have any uh there's no recriminations in our dressing room at all and um this group with the age of a lot of them have shown a side that can go on and and you know continue to challenge and stay on the big stages we have been in the last few years yeah because people will will look at it won't they and they'll say they'll say semi-final final quarter final but do you do you feel that this here is the best that we've seen from your england team and and does does that give you that determination to go with them and see what you can do in 2024 i think tonight's performance against you know as good a team as we've faced frankly um was was fantastic to see um but in the end we're in the business of winning and we haven't done enough to win so for all the positive feel about the performance um you know we're sitting going home and uh yeah tonight that's very difficult and what will you do you'll stick with it yeah you'll stick with it after every tournament we've sat and reflected because you know these tournaments take a huge amount of energy and um tonight is not a good night to make good decisions um i think i think it's right for myself and the fa to to talk everything through because i know how that process has been after previous tournaments and you you you yeah you need time really um it's an important call for all of us thanks gareth thanks john thank you congratulations gareth savgate live with john morrie 08085 909693 rob green michael richards matt upson and julien loran are all with us um you heard gareth there matt talk about you know the past two tournaments england have played better football at this tournament than when they got to the final of the euro's or the semi finals of the last world cup haven't they yeah i'd agree with that um i would agree with with the manner in how we played has has been better um i think it's a team that's growing it's a team that's improving it's a group of players that to me look very strong together you know we have a real togetherness which is a strength on the pitch um and i think you've seen that in players that have come into this tournament not in great form and have played well you know i think we've defended well as a group and that was a real suspect area in the last six months and it's been it's been good it's been very good on the whole um the midfield looks really exciting spoke about before the game we've got great attacking options and depths of squad um and i think that we have played better and and we look at more convincing team it seems crazy because we've gone out in the quarter finals this time we haven't done as well as the last world cup or like you said made a final in the euros but i think there's a lot to take from this that show that england are moving in the right direction um and maybe it needs a lot of these experiences of defeat maybe negative experience to keep improving as a group and whether or not we can turn that into a win i hope so but there's a lot of positive there's a lot that the whole squad and the manager have to be really proud of if england had gone back to a back three tonight mica and say lost one nil or or even two one um then the criticism would would be different i think do you know what do you know what i mean they they've been a front foot team in bar bar the game against the usa really they've been a front foot team in this world cup yeah exactly that i mean we talked about that many times would we be negative and i don't think southgate can be accused of being negative it was on the front foot they took it to france and another day they could have won the game and i think that's why there will be a lot of positivity obviously with the missing the pen and the history of england football it's never nicer to miss a pen and look france might have scored another goal who said you know if he would have gone to extra time and england you know front still might have won but i don't think there can be any negatives about england at all the the only one area where we can improve is being potent in front of goal and unfortunately we couldn't do that today just on the on the experience and tournaments and history before you before you win one joules so england england have gone semi finals world cup final at the euros quarter finals now before france won in 2018 you lost the final of the euros at home to portland in 2016 was the 2014 a world cup where france imploded or was that was that normal no it's a game that actually reminded me of this we lost to us germany in the semifinal in the quarter in the quarter finals that was it yeah yeah where france played better than germany considered goal on set pieces and that was it and the frustration that we had that night is the frustration that you and the players will have now for england because we were so close and yet we didn't just have that know-how just have that sort of clinicality and the the ruthlessness you know where to have won again in germany who who looked like on the page like never in that really and they never panicked and i don't think the french really panicked to that even when they were under pressure even when england were the better side and that's that's part of the learning curve there's one thing i would say though the the crochet game modridge and his flair ran that game in 2018 the final of the euros variety had a very similar role and gris man to there again and i think england will have to learn on how to deal with those flair players who do you not used to play against because they actually not that many in the promelig where all the england players play and also maybe what's lacking at time in the england team is that bit of flair and yeah rice henderson belingham are great the ringers are great maybe maybe a james madison could bring that bit of a bit of magic when you you don't expect it or when you expected the least i've been saying all tournament in terms of i think foden doesn't play centrally because he's not trusted defensively and gris man does is not the most hardworking he worked hard today but he give them an outlet and he was a different so instead of having one of our most creative players out on the wing i agree i would like to see him in the central to start dictating games and the gris man experiment of this four cup let's not forget this is a position that he never played in before three weeks ago and to see him perform like this against england such a strong england side in a quarter finals of the world cup in a new position for him shows that it can be done with the right coaching with the right mentality with the right players well now everybody is gris man but still and i think that's a bit missing at times for england because like we said in the first half it was a bit predictable second half was a bit different i give you that but i think a madison or a foden more central even mounts his best could bring that extra little thing i think matt would you go along with that i would i mean i'd love to see filchvoden central and actually matt in the first half when he did for the last 10 minutes so he just started to drift a bit yeah yeah he came inside the pitch and i just think he's got this ability to twist and turn and to find those passes he's clever on the edge of the 18-yard box in terms of lifting balls over players threading passes through exactly what what jules is talking about there that that little bit of creative creativity and magic is being performed in front of the 18-yard box as opposed to wide on the wing um and for me that makes it a little bit more potent and i think that seeing him in that right i would just like to see him play there more just to just to get the feel of what that looked like or whether or not it did cost us out of possession and defensively we didn't look as good a team as what we would if say henderson was in the midfield and belligan was slightly deeper i don't disagree with anything anybody's saying but i do point out that gree greezman was very wide on the wing when he crossed it for the winning goal which was a big he was a corner before so he was wide from the corner that we can still provide magic moments from the wing true true and for fordonded he's got a few assists from from the wing of course but in terms of we're talking more about dictating the pace of of the game and i think him in that central area would have more the impact going forward um on the penalty on the miss penalty rob is it just one of those things is there an element of it being against your club goalkeeper and taking a second penalty against him in the game i mean only harry cayne will be able to tell us i suppose no why you're asking me well i did think that i'd be happy about really but you know just i'd keep going with it and hopefully you'll feel a bit of time with it answer no i do think that there is an extra bit of something in there with the the second penalty the fact that it was against lorise's buy and buy i do think that second penalty around is a little bit harder because the mind games are that bit more and you saw like you saw how far and hard lorise went into his dive and he was so convinced at this moment and it was something that i don't know whether harry cayne had thought about or whatever but he went that he decided to go a little bit higher and yes boy it went a lot higher grini would you have anticipated that okay that would you have died you have to dive that side knowing where harry cayne likes to put his penalties and he went the opposite side to the first one there's only one way lorise was going to dive on that second one no i think having having lorise dived the wrong way there was only one way that lorise could go then because if he'd have dived the same way i did it in a game where i dived the same way three times on a penalty that was retaken twice and got the wrong way every time and it looked ridiculous it looked ridiculous to tell her what you're doing you just watched two of them go that way but well he's got to go what the other way wants but i do yeah but i was desperate and i'm captain hindsight here it you're desperately saying just go down the middle go down the middle the one thing lorise was not going to do with standstill but we're going to talk about the referee yeah we'll do it let me just say something quickly the first frankfurt game in the champions league harry cayne scored the first penalty he's got a second penalty late he takes it and blasted over the bar exactly the same way and i do wonder i'm not saying that he can't take two penalties and score them in the same game that's not what i'm saying however that's two games now in the same season in the space of two months or something where clearly the second penalty and that game i mean suppose we're three two up so it was the ninth-jet many or something they still won the game it's not it's not the same caliber tonight but there might be something in there that second penalties which i think for everybody must be quite hard to take and we will talk about the referee and we'll do that after we hear from harry maguire with kelly summers harry i imagine that's incredibly difficult to take what's the manager has just said to you in the dressing room in there yeah he's just said it's difficult to take like he've just said he's really proud of us what he's asked of us tonight in a big occasion on a big stage against a good team we delivered we've dominated the game really we've dominated the ball we've dominated the chances we've had all the pressure and this is tournament football you can find yourself on the end of a result because of they've been clinical in two moments and we haven't so this is this is why there's so many upsets and why tournament football everyone loves because anything can happen and but we know that we've played well tonight but ultimately not well enough we saw you all rallying around you caps in harry kane at the end what's he been like in that dressing room too well we all know he's a big character he's our leader he's our captain we follow him he's been magnificent ever since i've stepped into this ever since i've stepped in to make my debut for for my country he's been here he's been the leader he's welcomed me and he'll pick himself up he's a world-class striker and when you're taking as many penalties as he does throughout the season he's going to miss us so it'll be hurt it'll be disappointed as as are all of us of course of course we're not looking at and blaming age at all he's he's our tallies man he's he's got us out of trouble so many times in the past and ultimately we we wasn't clinical enough throughout the game not just not just stage with his penalties those two penalties were decisions you did get from the referee but what did you make of his performance overall really poor very poor from minute one five six fouls in the first 15 minutes not one yellow card for me it's a foul for the first goal leading up to to bichaya um i can't really go into explain how bad his performance really was um but yeah i don't want to go into too much because i'm getting fine but it was really really poor his decisions throughout the game not just the big decisions but even though the big decisions were wrong you never give us anything but yeah throughout the game it was really poor well there you go matt upson that that starts the discussion on the referee doesn't it well nicely chappers if i'm honest and i'm i'm happy i won't get fined and i'm happy to go into a bit bit more detail um it arigua spot on i thought he was appalling the referee some of the the the fouls right in front of his face that were going on and they were genuine attempts for the ball but just missed time tackles or clashes or legs coming together um you know we can go back to the the one on sacca before the goal that that one's a little bit in the balance i think it's there's contact um perhaps that one but but there was another one on sacra in the second half right in front of him we got a sandwich between two players and clearly tripped nobody won the ball play on that the harry came with uppermint carnaugh on on the penalty shout i mean i don't know if anyone else has got a view on it but i kind of understand well the only that's not a foul the only thing we thought matt and still still on these monitors we've only had one we haven't actually had a replay of it was to was to think var must have decided that the initial contact was outside the box but we were told by them you bring it back to a free kick yeah but we were told by we can't you can't do that with the ar can you you could only give it as a penalty or not a penalty but um but itv said to us that they thought they thought it was on the line and it was it was a penalty so i thought the lack of uh the lack of showing was pretty damning on the replays and in its uh it's guilt and its omission omission really and so yeah i think there there was there was a number in there decisions that were baffling and decisions that weren't made that really did need to be and and that's not an english thing i mean you're you're nodding as well here yeah there were there were tackles that looked fine that you gave free kicks for there were there were blatant fouls that he that he played play on his judgment seemed suspect at that time i mean he wasn't as bad as last night's one but i mean no i mean but i was going to say last night even in the portuguese the portugal morocco game i think there was a few things that was a bit dodgy last night certainly as well so a lot of players now complaining about referees which is not good there's one on sacca in the second half just on the 30 yards almost 30 yards from the front he doesn't give that one which is a blatant one and then after that i think there's just a push on rabbiou and he gives that for france and i was even me i was like come on man come on that's the one that's the one i remember yeah and i think even the the penalty were mason mount i mean he had to put that in that that was to me quite a clear foul real time um could that be a red as well or not because i'm not sure man can get to the ball so i can understand the foul and the penalty but red i think would have been would have been harsh yeah it wasn't he wasn't denying the goal scoring opportunity he has to have the ball under control or be within reach of the ball and he was neither so that wasn't a red but yeah it was it some of it was just mystifying i mean i didn't see enough of the portugal morocco game to know whether the referee was was poor or not but michael what you would say is up until the quarter finals in the main we've had some very good refereeing performances and actually the games have been good because of it and now we've had we well certainly in the two evening games the last two days they've been iffy yeah they've been flowing nice um the referees have been really good to be honest but yeah over the last couple i think in group games it's not as intense you know once you get out the group and it's not that's when you know the decisions are a little bit erratic and if you noticed as well both benches every time there's a decision they was up you didn't see so much of that in the group games and they're just a little bit more under pressure do you think there's referees here in the quarter finals eyeball in the final to say well hold on a minute if i make my mark here and make a show of myself and make a name for myself here then i get the final yeah i mean certainly obviously your team cannot be still in the competition for you to go so the brazilian referee tonight of course mateu laos last night i mean he can't last last night he needs to go on holidays he needs to go on holidays there's nice places around here he can go to Dubai on holidays if he wants he can't referee again but but yeah rob is right at some point those kind of referees will be thinking okay my team is 90 more in tournament i've got a shout uh mica final thoughts yeah i mean positive positive obviously it's it's a disappointing night for for everyone um but i think the the boys can hold their heads high you want to see them finishing them chances but all in all you know the way they approach the game the way they never give up yeah they can proud of their performance tonight matt yeah i completely agree with mica i think it's you know it's so so disappointing to watch and the feeling after another defeat and knock out stages of a tournament but i just think england have done you know that produced so many good things across this tournament in many different ways you know the the squad is together the team's positive we've gone out in a in a manner that you can look at and go we really had a go tonight and and it's one of those things the fine margins we spoke about but really proud of of the of the players and you know they should be proud of themselves that's as emotional rob a set of interviews that we've had actually after recent losses i i because you know what it feels to me like they feel it more compared to the the final against isli and the semi-final against Croatia and i think they thought this tournament was there for them actually and understandably so it was opening up you look at the way it's gone and the way that the just the shocks the results and it's it's opening up and look we've we've been through recriminations and i've been through recriminations personally and you you know you look at this group of 18 months ago and the abuse that they took for missing penalties and this is not the time for that this is not the moment this is not the man who should be facing recriminations this is not the team nor the manager they've done a brilliant job it was a good performance tonight a really good performance it lacked in just the finest and finest of margins and that was it and that is football and as we said at some point much early this evening before you were with us jules and morocco argentina final would be good for the fans that are always wondering when you would have a dig like that yeah so it would be france argentina or france Croatia again we can have a repeat from four years ago which is be great this will be an away game on wednesday it would be oh it will it will i mean and and that's something that they will have to do it here because we've seen a lot of team struggle against morocco portugal belgium of course spain as well because of that atmosphere yeah and and a very different game as well because france will have 70 percent or 65 percent of the board they will have to play in a very different way they won't have space they won't have all of that so it's another one that deschan has to work out he's getting nervous already i know yeah but well done obviously i didn't want to thank you allelie blue still you know jules thank you very much you and all the reaction on the world cup daily podcast which will be on the feed very shortly and here are chris and robbie
