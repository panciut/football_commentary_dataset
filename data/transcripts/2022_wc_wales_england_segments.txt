[0.00 - 4.52] P:1979.33 E:0.065432 |  And the players of both teams take a knee before kick-off here.
[4.52 - 5.96] P:1984.70 E:0.111260 |  And there's the whistle.
[5.96 - 7.56] P:1964.83 E:0.107433 |  And the game begins.
[7.56 - 11.80] P:1857.71 E:0.095978 |  Wales in the red shirts, white shorts and red socks.
[11.80 - 14.60] P:1831.49 E:0.090194 |  And England in their first choice colours as well.
[14.60 - 16.60] P:1830.56 E:0.106202 |  The white shirts with the blue trim on the shoulders,
[16.60 - 19.24] P:1807.07 E:0.094422 |  the dark blue shorts and the white socks.
[19.24 - 22.00] P:1697.74 E:0.105804 |  So it is Wales against England. This is five live.
[22.00 - 26.36] P:1695.48 E:0.104342 |  And BBC sounds, of course, the match is live on BBC Television tonight.
[26.36 - 27.72] P:1656.53 E:0.104131 |  It's on BBC One.
[27.84 - 30.44] P:1815.97 E:0.094787 |  If you're on your way home, don't miss it.
[30.44 - 33.64] P:1647.77 E:0.099002 |  Guy Mowbray, Jermaine Genus and Danny Gabbard on with a commentary there.
[33.64 - 38.32] P:1787.90 E:0.090787 |  But if you would like to watch it with five lives radio commentary
[38.32 - 41.64] P:1740.51 E:0.088998 |  synced up to the pictures, then go to the BBC Eye Player
[41.64 - 43.72] P:1761.92 E:0.085183 |  and look for World Cup Extra.
[43.72 - 46.76] P:1704.96 E:0.102323 |  So Wales with a throw-in inside their own half.
[46.76 - 48.76] P:1763.19 E:0.085719 |  It'd be interesting to see, as we've discussed,
[48.76 - 50.80] P:1575.37 E:0.099555 |  what sort of a start to this game is it?
[50.80 - 53.64] P:1744.59 E:0.091685 |  Is it going to be hair-and-scare-and from the off?
[53.64 - 54.92] P:1671.92 E:0.082940 |  It is England in possession.
[54.92 - 57.24] P:1945.99 E:0.114667 |  Kane playing it back and misplaces the pass.
[57.24 - 59.56] P:1903.39 E:0.098430 |  It's a huge cheer for that from the red wall.
[59.56 - 60.68] P:1824.75 E:0.095211 |  That's gone down well.
[60.68 - 64.36] P:1849.62 E:0.088212 |  Matt Upsson, Mike Erichers with us here in the commentary position.
[64.36 - 66.68] P:1683.09 E:0.099190 |  And Jane Ludlow, former Welsh,
[66.68 - 68.56] P:1804.14 E:0.090242 |  a national former Welsh manager,
[68.56 - 71.48] P:1739.32 E:0.097581 |  is with us as well from back in the studio.
[71.48 - 72.32] P:1727.99 E:0.072150 |  Matt?
[72.32 - 73.84] P:1685.04 E:0.116459 |  Yeah, I think it has been that kind of start.
[73.84 - 75.24] P:1686.88 E:0.111850 |  It's a little bit scrappy, isn't it?
[75.24 - 78.56] P:1835.22 E:0.095119 |  Just that pass from Harry Kane there would indicate
[78.56 - 80.56] P:1714.02 E:0.114774 |  that the tensions are a little bit high.
[80.56 - 82.84] P:1691.74 E:0.105937 |  And I think it's going to be a little bit back territory
[82.84 - 84.08] P:1682.58 E:0.116654 |  in these opening stages.
[84.08 - 87.20] P:1717.95 E:0.110869 |  Neither team are going to get their foot on the ball properly.
[87.64 - 89.56] P:1661.87 E:0.113581 |  And Wales had a clear intention from kick-off,
[89.56 - 91.28] P:1745.66 E:0.112238 |  which was to go long for Keith for more,
[91.28 - 94.08] P:1813.70 E:0.104466 |  straight back to Ben Davis, long ball into more,
[94.08 - 96.80] P:1917.00 E:0.109076 |  try and pick up those knock-downs and play from there.
[96.80 - 101.80] P:1940.83 E:0.107077 |  Nice and stones, taking the ball out from the back after controlling it.
[101.80 - 104.08] P:1677.62 E:0.107187 |  And yes, Gareth Bale on the right-hand side,
[104.08 - 106.56] P:1798.61 E:0.088531 |  and James on the left-hand side.
[106.56 - 110.16] P:1832.17 E:0.104198 |  And it is England in possession on the left-hand side.
[110.16 - 114.52] P:1740.59 E:0.101724 |  In the first half, Wales are playing from left to right, as we look.
[114.52 - 117.16] P:1744.66 E:0.101995 |  Jude Bellingham then strokes the ball into centre-field.
[117.28 - 120.40] P:1614.97 E:0.103159 |  And I think after the most recent performances for England,
[120.40 - 124.12] P:1702.72 E:0.098785 |  of course, in the nil-nil draw against the United States
[124.12 - 128.64] P:1759.83 E:0.101852 |  and for Wales in what turned out to be a deeply disappointing match
[128.64 - 132.28] P:1810.92 E:0.107990 |  against Iran, the reaction is just to see what sort of performance
[132.28 - 135.16] P:1907.29 E:0.103402 |  the two teams are able to put here in here tonight.
[135.16 - 137.44] P:1885.52 E:0.107267 |  Shaw gets the ball back way down below.
[137.44 - 141.08] P:1872.67 E:0.096852 |  So here on the left-hand side and then goes back into his own half
[141.08 - 146.16] P:1740.68 E:0.093110 |  to Harry Maguire, named as the man of the match against the United States.
[146.20 - 149.60] P:1588.08 E:0.110068 |  It's interesting, John, to see how high Aaron Ramsey is at the moment.
[149.60 - 152.60] P:1708.13 E:0.104536 |  He's really pressing high, sitting almost in front of Declan Rice,
[152.60 - 156.00] P:1765.73 E:0.098424 |  trying to push up behind Keefer Moore from that midfield area.
[156.00 - 160.72] P:1696.53 E:0.092139 |  I think he's going to play that role of link in between the back four
[160.72 - 164.48] P:1782.37 E:0.098404 |  or the midfield and Keefer Moore, and also try and pressure England a little bit.
[165.64 - 167.08] P:1880.10 E:0.106297 |  Nil-nil, very early stages.
[167.08 - 168.96] P:1689.92 E:0.088679 |  England with it on the right-hand side.
[168.96 - 173.92] P:1714.75 E:0.096251 |  Incidentally, Iran-USA is on television on BBC Two right now.
[173.96 - 176.84] P:1776.82 E:0.103819 |  Here is Rice playing the ball to the left-hand side to Shaw.
[176.84 - 179.00] P:1748.47 E:0.096383 |  Rashford is outside him on the touchline.
[179.00 - 181.16] P:1810.26 E:0.104802 |  This is only the second match that Rashford has started,
[181.16 - 182.88] P:1829.94 E:0.111454 |  a World Cup or a European Championship,
[182.88 - 185.08] P:1782.20 E:0.110190 |  and a run from him up to the edge of the penalty area,
[185.08 - 190.08] P:1882.17 E:0.101199 |  but ran into red shirts and lost possession, and Wales were able to clear.
[190.08 - 191.56] P:1843.57 E:0.102714 |  England back in possession though.
[191.56 - 195.32] P:1958.86 E:0.103224 |  Shaw back into his own half and then back to Harry Maguire,
[195.32 - 198.24] P:1953.80 E:0.101126 |  and England have it inside their own territory.
[198.24 - 203.44] P:1881.93 E:0.102995 |  So Maguire's pass deflected forward off Ramsey
[203.44 - 207.00] P:1894.85 E:0.093566 |  and bounces down for Rashford,
[207.00 - 209.76] P:1850.60 E:0.104205 |  quickly onto it to play it back into his own half.
[209.76 - 211.56] P:1857.22 E:0.104264 |  So there was the clamour for Fordham.
[211.56 - 214.32] P:1719.55 E:0.096772 |  He started wide on the right-hand side,
[214.32 - 217.04] P:1739.56 E:0.092184 |  and Rashford here on the left-hand side.
[217.04 - 221.00] P:1824.74 E:0.101151 |  So Phil Fordham starting a match in a World Cup for the first time.
[221.00 - 225.32] P:1863.63 E:0.098392 |  Just one substitute appearing so far at this tournament in the first group match
[225.32 - 230.88] P:1797.40 E:0.092901 |  when he came on as a substitute in the 71st minute in the route of Iran.
[231.88 - 235.60] P:1833.94 E:0.104328 |  Maguire, just to his right, to Stones.
[235.60 - 239.12] P:1862.23 E:0.110733 |  This is rather like the opening stages of the USA game.
[239.12 - 241.44] P:1916.62 E:0.111392 |  England keeping possession inside their own half.
[241.44 - 245.56] P:1914.18 E:0.094326 |  Rice then goes back to Maguire, and very patient from England,
[245.56 - 248.44] P:1890.43 E:0.095568 |  and now Pickford will get a touch as well as it's played across to him,
[248.44 - 250.12] P:1933.78 E:0.088475 |  just passes it out short.
[250.12 - 252.04] P:1964.04 E:0.103367 |  Kyle Walker, his first involvement.
[252.04 - 254.12] P:1949.39 E:0.089149 |  Kyle Walker at this tournament,
[254.12 - 256.44] P:1904.36 E:0.096886 |  first time he's played since the Manchester Dadi,
[256.44 - 258.24] P:1827.36 E:0.091190 |  having now recovered from that joint injury.
[258.24 - 259.88] P:1912.14 E:0.100074 |  So no cure and tripp yet tonight,
[260.08 - 262.44] P:1741.48 E:0.111710 |  and England still knocking it around in their own half.
[262.44 - 265.00] P:1702.44 E:0.115099 |  It's been nice to see us move it with a little bit more purpose.
[265.00 - 267.04] P:1824.86 E:0.107295 |  I know that sometimes you're calming the game,
[267.04 - 269.16] P:1802.76 E:0.115811 |  but I think being a bit more progressive with our passing,
[269.16 - 271.56] P:1872.25 E:0.101889 |  moving the ball quicker around the back,
[271.56 - 272.64] P:1744.14 E:0.112892 |  especially with Harry Maguire,
[272.64 - 275.28] P:1836.93 E:0.098418 |  who's holding onto the ball for quite a long time,
[275.28 - 276.92] P:1752.93 E:0.111156 |  and rather kind of lend the ball, get it back,
[276.92 - 280.96] P:1780.79 E:0.095685 |  and then the pitch changes, and you can maybe find that pass.
[280.96 - 282.76] P:1855.20 E:0.102839 |  Just as you spoke, Matt,
[282.76 - 285.92] P:1925.01 E:0.104683 |  Maguire went for a long pass down the left-hand side that Rashford,
[285.92 - 288.60] P:1839.86 E:0.097773 |  with his heels on the white line, couldn't keep the ball in play,
[288.64 - 291.48] P:1743.40 E:0.090441 |  and maybe is the throwing to Wales.
[291.48 - 294.36] P:1905.49 E:0.102331 |  Let's bring in an early thought from Jane Ludlow back in the studio.
[294.36 - 295.36] P:1935.39 E:0.046010 |  Jane?
[295.36 - 296.80] P:1689.56 E:0.109691 |  Well, look, it's what we thought.
[296.80 - 298.00] P:1953.42 E:0.107055 |  It's a lower block from us.
[298.00 - 299.96] P:1863.44 E:0.100636 |  You know, we're defending the half-way line back.
[299.96 - 301.52] P:1740.55 E:0.101581 |  At times it looks like a 4-4-2,
[301.52 - 304.16] P:1702.18 E:0.096845 |  but it's actually a 4-4-1-1 defensive shape,
[304.16 - 305.84] P:1771.90 E:0.084755 |  and you've got Aaron Ramsey,
[305.84 - 307.84] P:1615.68 E:0.110187 |  predominantly defensively on the pitch there
[307.84 - 309.76] P:1801.75 E:0.076889 |  to deal with Declan Rice today.
[309.76 - 311.24] P:1860.61 E:0.108775 |  And even in the first few minutes,
[311.24 - 314.12] P:1709.41 E:0.102469 |  you can see England will generally play with, like, a single pivot.
[314.12 - 315.92] P:1835.72 E:0.098609 |  So Declan Rice dropping off,
[315.92 - 318.12] P:1797.07 E:0.081948 |  dropping off, looking for the ball from the back line.
[318.16 - 321.00] P:1770.82 E:0.105652 |  But it'll be interesting to see if they end up doing too deep a line
[321.00 - 323.00] P:1890.63 E:0.090685 |  in midfielders, how we cope with that.
[323.00 - 326.68] P:1900.03 E:0.109599 |  Because right now, Aaron Ramsey is on that pitch to defend Declan Rice,
[326.68 - 329.36] P:1892.67 E:0.099917 |  and that looks like 99% of his job tonight.
[330.12 - 331.40] P:2004.39 E:0.063924 |  Thank you, Jane.
[331.40 - 334.20] P:1688.50 E:0.103715 |  Wales, Nill, England, Nill, England thought they were away there,
[334.20 - 339.16] P:1790.70 E:0.089302 |  but referee, Levinchich, brought it back for a foul centrefield by Jordan Henderson.
[339.16 - 341.64] P:1825.96 E:0.100710 |  So Wales played back to Danny Ward.
[342.72 - 344.56] P:1924.19 E:0.109188 |  And great form for Leicester,
[344.56 - 348.84] P:1850.77 E:0.107774 |  for the resurgent Leicester City, played every minute at the Euro.
[348.84 - 350.40] P:1951.20 E:0.094045 |  So it has two-in-a-minute experience,
[350.40 - 354.56] P:1950.97 E:0.097748 |  but this is his first time starting at the World Cup, Danny Ward.
[354.56 - 356.64] P:1838.24 E:0.110637 |  He now is banning him on the left-hand side,
[356.64 - 358.16] P:1841.86 E:0.098532 |  over the halfway line to Rashford,
[358.16 - 360.64] P:1921.97 E:0.104155 |  who just passes it back to Declan Rice,
[360.64 - 364.08] P:1868.45 E:0.099250 |  who's managed to find a little bit of space away from Aaron Ramsey.
[364.08 - 367.60] P:1779.24 E:0.098925 |  Now the Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, out to the right-hand side.
[367.60 - 371.28] P:1711.20 E:0.091609 |  I thought he'd settled things down, Henderson, against the United States,
[371.28 - 374.84] P:1760.16 E:0.106446 |  when he came on as a substitute, he was playing at a third World Cup.
[374.84 - 377.08] P:1730.59 E:0.088829 |  Jordan Henderson, now to the left-hand side.
[377.08 - 379.84] P:1641.49 E:0.108648 |  I think it was a surprise to see him in the starting line-up today,
[379.84 - 382.84] P:1807.02 E:0.098682 |  was it, for a game like this, which is going to require
[382.84 - 386.60] P:1890.44 E:0.105380 |  that kind of more experienced head, maybe, in moments,
[386.60 - 388.68] P:1886.30 E:0.106156 |  of just handling the game in the occasion.
[389.28 - 391.08] P:1848.60 E:0.121164 |  Yes, likewise, similar thought.
[391.08 - 394.52] P:1888.44 E:0.113843 |  I think we knew that he was going to play from the moment that he was put up
[394.52 - 398.56] P:1877.65 E:0.105047 |  to speak to the media in the FIFA conference yesterday, Jordan Henderson.
[398.60 - 403.92] P:1846.42 E:0.103207 |  Ramsey is bundled over, five or six yards inside his own half,
[403.92 - 407.64] P:1800.54 E:0.095497 |  six minutes on the clock, Wales nil, England nil,
[407.64 - 411.36] P:1851.85 E:0.098906 |  still Iran nil, USA nil.
[412.40 - 416.20] P:1872.28 E:0.111209 |  Now, back it goes into Sevverfield, with Joel Rodon.
[417.20 - 419.72] P:1879.11 E:0.119132 |  Now out to the left-hand side, where James Grant keeping in.
[419.72 - 422.92] P:1891.69 E:0.101602 |  It's a throwing to England just inside the Welsh half.
[422.92 - 428.24] P:1825.36 E:0.099066 |  Joel Rodon, who is currently on loan in France with Wren,
[428.24 - 432.40] P:1828.45 E:0.098462 |  but from Tottenham, and there are actually 11 different British clubs
[432.40 - 435.56] P:1701.27 E:0.094794 |  represented by the 22 that are starting this match.
[435.56 - 437.28] P:1808.15 E:0.107142 |  England with Fordham trying to take it on,
[437.28 - 439.96] P:1864.89 E:0.090357 |  but wasn't able to get the ball under control.
[439.96 - 443.52] P:1898.27 E:0.098347 |  It's through the middle, the Kephamoura, and now Ford from Bale,
[443.52 - 445.16] P:1942.77 E:0.097708 |  but he's put far too much on that pass,
[445.16 - 449.04] P:2009.89 E:0.112599 |  Bale in the centre-circle, and it was right between it,
[449.04 - 451.32] P:1859.54 E:0.093002 |  bisected the two Welsh players, now for a throw.
[451.32 - 454.12] P:1805.96 E:0.102978 |  The Kephamoura just dragged in, both set the hearts of God,
[454.12 - 457.00] P:1720.86 E:0.090276 |  short for the ball and laid it off, and there's a big space
[457.04 - 460.48] P:1847.97 E:0.106974 |  in behind Karl Walker, and it was a poor pass over.
[460.48 - 462.80] P:1607.59 E:0.106518 |  I don't think they had any real runners into that area either,
[462.80 - 467.12] P:1622.77 E:0.092911 |  but I'm just still waiting for England to really show a bit of confidence
[467.12 - 471.00] P:1756.22 E:0.099962 |  with the ball and get a few passes together, a few combinations.
[471.88 - 474.92] P:1749.06 E:0.117073 |  In the Wales half, really, they've had the ball in and around their own half-way line,
[474.92 - 477.96] P:1768.91 E:0.101847 |  but nothing of note yet getting forwards into the wire players.
[477.96 - 480.16] P:1699.77 E:0.098246 |  I don't think Fordham's really seen the ball.
[481.36 - 484.40] P:1831.26 E:0.095116 |  So, Wales have got it in the centre-circle,
[484.52 - 487.64] P:1887.00 E:0.092933 |  and it's played back into central defence.
[487.64 - 490.20] P:1826.92 E:0.112749 |  The Mepham passes it back down here to Nico Williams,
[490.20 - 492.04] P:1835.82 E:0.092499 |  who's switched over to the right-hand side,
[492.04 - 494.32] P:1810.34 E:0.089141 |  playing us right back in this formation.
[494.32 - 496.44] P:1853.69 E:0.096922 |  Nico Williams now with nothing in for us,
[496.44 - 499.64] P:1979.36 E:0.108052 |  ball from centre-field, from Ankerty, but that...
[499.64 - 503.12] P:1950.00 E:0.103868 |  It aids Dan James on the far side as well, didn't get a chance, really,
[503.12 - 505.60] P:1850.70 E:0.100089 |  and it's had a play for a throw in to England.
[505.60 - 507.48] P:1756.91 E:0.098523 |  Yeah, now the team really is settling into it.
[507.48 - 510.92] P:1858.39 E:0.098262 |  No, not at all, and just that kind of a pit-in margin there for me.
[510.92 - 512.76] P:1820.64 E:0.109628 |  I think Dan James needs to almost stay wide.
[512.76 - 515.20] P:1883.10 E:0.099234 |  He'd rather him have his heels on the touchline
[515.20 - 516.64] P:1831.56 E:0.097266 |  and wait for that ball to get through,
[516.64 - 519.84] P:1762.90 E:0.095708 |  and then he's coming on to that pass and driving it a defender,
[519.84 - 523.52] P:1758.78 E:0.086481 |  but you're right, Jon, it's pretty much a scrappy start, isn't it?
[523.52 - 528.64] P:1806.62 E:0.081502 |  No real quality of any passes put together in control possession.
[528.64 - 530.16] P:1674.20 E:0.100162 |  England bringing the ball out from the back.
[530.16 - 532.92] P:1776.55 E:0.088053 |  That's Matt Upsen with us, played at the World Cup for England,
[532.92 - 535.00] P:1851.37 E:0.081412 |  scored at the World Cup for England,
[535.00 - 541.56] P:1769.63 E:0.097196 |  and it's currently 0-0 here in what is the 104th match between these sides.
[541.56 - 547.52] P:1832.69 E:0.090621 |  The first one back in 1879, 143 years ago, was played at the Oval,
[547.52 - 550.52] P:1787.66 E:0.075211 |  with the pitch covered in snow.
[550.52 - 555.64] P:1879.09 E:0.111931 |  I know this is a Winter World Cup, but Kane playing it through for Rashford through the middle.
[555.64 - 559.00] P:1969.48 E:0.094633 |  Ward comes out and makes a good stop at his feet.
[559.00 - 563.92] P:1917.43 E:0.096866 |  Came out quickly there, Danny Ward, and really England opened up the Welsh defence there.
[563.92 - 567.16] P:1850.75 E:0.098995 |  One pass from Kane through the middle, Rashford running onto it.
[567.16 - 570.80] P:1928.01 E:0.092967 |  We spoke before the match about how they could work together,
[570.84 - 574.00] P:1828.32 E:0.089854 |  and that was the great effect that Wales were saved by Danny Ward.
[574.00 - 577.04] P:1897.92 E:0.086098 |  Out of nothing, great anticipation from Declan Rice,
[577.04 - 579.08] P:1836.56 E:0.095626 |  steps in and just wins that ball in the midfield.
[579.08 - 585.12] P:1860.47 E:0.084212 |  It was bobbling about into Kane, and what I loved is that as soon as Rashford saw Declan Rice win that ball,
[585.12 - 591.56] P:1792.47 E:0.088039 |  his reaction to make that run in behind in the most hurtful place he could of the Welsh back four,
[591.56 - 593.96] P:1799.42 E:0.092599 |  and Harry Kane has the vision to try and slide him in.
[593.96 - 597.84] P:1753.84 E:0.089376 |  Decent pass, actually, just couldn't lift it over the keeper, Marcus Rashford,
[597.84 - 600.04] P:1922.09 E:0.086660 |  but good opportunity for England.
[600.08 - 603.60] P:1955.72 E:0.089252 |  Ward saved England, Jane looked low, but that was worrying.
[603.60 - 608.44] P:1932.52 E:0.109959 |  Here he was, and look, we're banking up with two banks of four right now, fairly compact units,
[608.44 - 611.76] P:1835.16 E:0.106812 |  but as soon as England moved the ball right to left a couple of times in switch play,
[611.76 - 615.56] P:1864.96 E:0.094169 |  there's gaps opening up in our midfield, which has nearly happened there again,
[615.56 - 618.88] P:1932.73 E:0.106548 |  straight through central areas, and it is a bit of a worry for us.
[618.88 - 621.76] P:1880.61 E:0.098433 |  England win it back, Walker gives it to his club mate, Foden,
[621.76 - 625.12] P:1712.55 E:0.090106 |  now back to Walker on the right-hand side, and he angles it back to Henderson,
[625.16 - 630.04] P:1809.93 E:0.086267 |  and Henderson's ball across the penalty area is cleared away by Nico Williams at the back post.
[630.76 - 638.96] P:1912.84 E:0.094660 |  Nico Williams being found by Jordan Henderson, his former club mate, Wales Nill, England Nill.
[638.96 - 642.92] P:1582.85 E:0.095330 |  Let's see how things have started between Iran and the USA, Conor McNamara.
[642.92 - 647.44] P:1812.45 E:0.106817 |  Nill Nill with just the first attempted goal from Eunice Moussa, the United States number six,
[647.44 - 651.00] P:1713.63 E:0.098165 |  whose birthday it is today, slightly leaning back, he drilled it over the top,
[651.00 - 655.92] P:1740.29 E:0.099862 |  as things stand, England and Iran going through, it's Iran Nill, USA at the moment, Nill.
[655.92 - 663.60] P:1914.02 E:0.093164 |  Yep, it's as you were, England four points, Iran three points, USA two points, Wales one point,
[663.60 - 667.40] P:1747.98 E:0.102008 |  coming into tonight, Rice playing it square to Stones,
[667.40 - 674.08] P:1754.05 E:0.099158 |  and now Kyle Walker on the right-hand side, and then back into his own half,
[674.08 - 677.56] P:1715.48 E:0.091411 |  and England I think will go not quite all the way back to Pickford,
[677.64 - 684.68] P:1768.10 E:0.095729 |  and Stones is going to keep possession, so the group winners tonight will play Senegal in the last 16,
[684.68 - 691.28] P:1715.43 E:0.098834 |  we know that now after the earlier matches, and the runners-up will play Louis van Gaal and the Netherlands,
[691.28 - 697.80] P:1775.38 E:0.110702 |  Wales Nill, England Nill, Wyatt goes for a long, long crossfield pass looking for Walker,
[697.80 - 703.20] P:1662.82 E:0.105282 |  but it's foleyed away by Ben Davis, and then England take up possession again inside the long half.
[703.20 - 708.64] P:1808.08 E:0.109252 |  England have settled a little bit after that chance, I think maybe if it was just a little shot for Wales,
[708.64 - 715.68] P:1898.60 E:0.108065 |  just to realise that it can happen very quickly, and they're just holding their position more than pressing in,
[715.68 - 720.04] P:1933.02 E:0.097207 |  and England having comfortable possession of the ball in their own half,
[720.04 - 724.96] P:1874.52 E:0.094335 |  just need to create those spaces and just get their key players on the ball.
[724.96 - 730.32] P:1832.04 E:0.098005 |  Long pass from Pickford, just to the left of the penalty area, looking for Kane,
[730.44 - 736.08] P:1847.63 E:0.103083 |  but that's dealt with by Rodon, and so Wales have got it back again.
[736.08 - 741.40] P:1842.60 E:0.093468 |  Jo Allen is starting a match for the first time since mid-September,
[741.40 - 745.96] P:1834.64 E:0.105982 |  a long pass forward from Williams, but that's William the run of Gareth Bale,
[745.96 - 750.88] P:1724.46 E:0.110112 |  Pickford's able to underarm it out to John Stones, now to Walker on the right-hand side,
[750.88 - 753.36] P:1932.61 E:0.099067 |  but he just goes back to Pickford.
[753.36 - 758.96] P:1880.81 E:0.108311 |  Well, we wonder whether it might be a gun haul in start, it's not, no, it's not a gun haul start,
[758.96 - 763.52] P:1713.68 E:0.100256 |  it's not a start of it scrappy, as you'd expect, neither team really settled in the first five minutes,
[763.52 - 768.32] P:1536.63 E:0.102730 |  a lot of loose balls, the balls bobbling around in midfield, going out for throw-ins,
[768.32 - 772.88] P:1683.67 E:0.087848 |  but the game's finally settled, like I said, I think that chance for Marcus Rashford
[772.88 - 776.88] P:1777.43 E:0.089935 |  has just sent a little message of how quickly the game could turn,
[776.88 - 781.72] P:1891.46 E:0.090169 |  maybe it just causes a little bit of caution sometimes, and it's just settled.
[781.72 - 786.00] P:1885.03 E:0.112396 |  Walker's pass, a long pass from right to left this time, chested down by Shaw.
[786.08 - 789.60] P:1889.95 E:0.108517 |  Might have been a hand ball by Nico Williams, it was, as the referee.
[789.60 - 791.96] P:1830.58 E:0.111472 |  That's a pretty good, a decent position on the left wing.
[791.96 - 796.44] P:1724.01 E:0.109769 |  It is, I mean, I think he tucks his arm behind his back, Nico Williams,
[796.44 - 801.72] P:1770.01 E:0.097354 |  just to try and stop that pass, it just clips his hand, I think it's just a reaction from him.
[801.72 - 806.20] P:1679.54 E:0.100210 |  It's a nice position, you look at the threat that Harry Maguire was,
[806.20 - 810.40] P:1718.46 E:0.094512 |  especially in the first game, from any kind of crosses or set pieces,
[810.40 - 813.80] P:1761.01 E:0.089317 |  he's certainly a player that England need to look at.
[813.88 - 817.60] P:1765.55 E:0.096265 |  Shaw and Rashford are together here on the left-hand side,
[817.60 - 822.36] P:1770.94 E:0.097051 |  the two of the Manchester United men just looking at each other, having a little word,
[822.36 - 827.44] P:1797.04 E:0.087653 |  and then Rashford looks down, Shaw looks into the centre,
[827.44 - 831.72] P:1623.20 E:0.103081 |  Wales holding their line about a yard inside the penalty area.
[831.72 - 834.84] P:1815.16 E:0.104182 |  Harry Kane, closest to the penalty spot.
[834.84 - 839.16] P:1962.57 E:0.108637 |  Shaw waiting to take this, left foot in front of right,
[839.16 - 843.00] P:1898.85 E:0.113534 |  there's the whistle from the referee, it will be looked Shaw with the free kick,
[843.00 - 846.56] P:1829.79 E:0.107360 |  played in towards the back post looking for Maguire, but that's headed away,
[846.56 - 849.52] P:1916.85 E:0.107212 |  it comes out to Foulden, kicks it down and shoots from the angle,
[849.52 - 854.08] P:1883.98 E:0.105262 |  but drags it wide through a number of players inside the box, but goal kick, nil-nil.
[854.08 - 857.72] P:1933.27 E:0.107878 |  Yeah, I think he just tries to hit that through the bodies there, Phil Foden,
[857.72 - 861.96] P:1939.73 E:0.112353 |  picks up a good position, identifies that the ball's going to get cleared,
[861.96 - 865.72] P:1851.41 E:0.114411 |  and he tries to hit that near post through the legs of a couple of Welsh players,
[865.72 - 870.08] P:1740.64 E:0.091723 |  just to see what happens really, but he just doesn't execute it.
[870.12 - 874.68] P:1772.89 E:0.097305 |  Not a clean strike, just drags the ball well wider that near post.
[874.68 - 879.00] P:1773.67 E:0.090107 |  Good noise inside the stadium for Wales England, the red wall,
[879.00 - 885.24] P:1802.38 E:0.089948 |  they stand out so clearly behind that goal that Danny Ward is protecting to our left,
[885.24 - 891.28] P:1781.98 E:0.093191 |  and the England fans all around the Lourdes here at the other end with so many England flags.
[891.28 - 895.12] P:2012.34 E:0.123992 |  Ward, that's a pull, they're hit by Ward, he's got that all done,
[895.12 - 898.32] P:1936.12 E:0.099820 |  and he immediately apologises, just scuffed it straight out of play,
[899.04 - 903.36] P:1830.44 E:0.094724 |  I think he's even chuckling to himself, to be honest, it was that far off, wasn't it?
[903.36 - 906.92] P:1748.65 E:0.091928 |  But he's got some credit in the bank mat already, that was a decent stop.
[906.92 - 911.24] P:1723.08 E:0.092668 |  No, he comes out quickly, Marcus Rashford tries to lift the ball over him,
[911.24 - 915.08] P:1803.75 E:0.083844 |  but he was off the line and saw the danger and came out, it was a good block.
[915.08 - 919.08] P:1843.14 E:0.099222 |  Yeah, informed, five clean sheets in his last six Premier League appearances.
[919.08 - 922.28] P:1956.51 E:0.118340 |  England with the ball on the right hand side, Foden trying to find Henderson,
[922.28 - 927.52] P:1950.87 E:0.097020 |  but of course comes Davis and puts it out of play, and it's a throw in for England.
[927.56 - 933.20] P:1915.50 E:0.101689 |  The wail are there in that far corner, it's going to be left to Kyle Walker to take this.
[933.20 - 938.04] P:1906.82 E:0.102723 |  England with Foden and Henderson in the full-back position, and it is Foden that's used,
[938.04 - 941.88] P:1755.87 E:0.093379 |  and now he's trying to find a way into the penalty area between a couple of Wales players,
[941.88 - 944.48] P:1808.37 E:0.086023 |  but it's played back to Henderson, and now back to Walker,
[944.48 - 947.20] P:1768.66 E:0.086948 |  and Walker sort of scoops it in field with his right foot,
[947.20 - 949.60] P:1879.53 E:0.095217 |  and Wright plays it back to the halfway line.
[949.60 - 952.80] P:1815.26 E:0.088954 |  Still goalers, first 15 minutes have now been played.
[952.80 - 957.32] P:1905.08 E:0.101018 |  One big chance when Kane slipped through Rashford through the middle,
[957.36 - 960.68] P:1968.88 E:0.106666 |  and Ward came out to make the save.
[960.68 - 963.64] P:1897.73 E:0.109568 |  Still no-nil in the other match.
[963.64 - 968.56] P:1862.83 E:0.086050 |  McGuire just knocks it to his right, to Stones,
[968.56 - 971.64] P:1771.28 E:0.089234 |  there was not too much movement in front of John Stones,
[971.64 - 974.80] P:1896.85 E:0.095363 |  so just takes another touch and gives it back to McGuire.
[974.80 - 977.28] P:1859.46 E:0.097700 |  This is all very static, I must say.
[977.28 - 979.96] P:1701.71 E:0.107716 |  Mass is a possession at the moment though for England, isn't it?
[979.96 - 984.12] P:1810.75 E:0.103052 |  Right, he's a little bit in their own half and not particularly threatening,
[984.12 - 988.04] P:1859.34 E:0.097621 |  but Wales just need to get a hold of the ball to the edge of the area to Kane.
[988.04 - 988.84] P:1841.62 E:0.104633 |  Then, Cleo.
[988.84 - 992.64] P:1956.82 E:0.112436 |  And then, Kane, that was heavy, the challenge from behind on him by Metham.
[992.64 - 997.56] P:1827.79 E:0.096649 |  Kane went down, felt the contact, gets a free kick, left of centre, 25 yards out.
[997.56 - 1002.36] P:1862.20 E:0.085806 |  This is a nice distance, and he's got a nice bit of angle on this free kick.
[1002.36 - 1006.64] P:1792.42 E:0.104201 |  It's left of centre, probably between the penalty spot and the edge of the 18-yard bot,
[1006.64 - 1008.92] P:1752.66 E:0.082277 |  but, like you say, about 10 yards out.
[1008.92 - 1012.32] P:1708.01 E:0.086046 |  It's almost ideal for that dipping free kick
[1012.36 - 1016.36] P:1750.69 E:0.089826 |  that if you can get it up and down over the wall, could cause a real problem toward...
[1018.16 - 1021.64] P:1891.93 E:0.098495 |  So there are four England players around this free kick.
[1021.64 - 1024.20] P:1840.68 E:0.088737 |  Rashford is behind it, Foulden's there as well.
[1024.20 - 1027.04] P:1761.38 E:0.102515 |  Henderson, Rice, and actually now he's five.
[1027.04 - 1028.44] P:1833.23 E:0.084189 |  Yeah, that's half the team.
[1029.92 - 1032.56] P:1761.34 E:0.097130 |  Rashford wanders away, so it won't be him.
[1032.56 - 1034.80] P:1591.13 E:0.110503 |  He looks slightly hand-dogged as he does so.
[1034.80 - 1039.96] P:1725.68 E:0.103553 |  Maybe he did fancy having a go, and he's having a chat with John Stones now on the edge of the wall.
[1040.00 - 1047.48] P:1857.63 E:0.101501 |  So Declan, Rice, Shaw, and actually Stones and Rashford are now walking back to Henderson.
[1047.48 - 1049.76] P:1834.19 E:0.109876 |  They're thinking, where's Tripp here?
[1051.16 - 1052.36] P:1881.58 E:0.121104 |  Why's he not here?
[1052.36 - 1053.52] P:1895.26 E:0.097172 |  On the bench.
[1054.12 - 1059.40] P:1769.53 E:0.108408 |  And Stones and Rashford then walk back into position, and Henderson's lining them up.
[1060.64 - 1062.52] P:1834.69 E:0.103927 |  I'm not sure there's going to be a shot here.
[1062.52 - 1066.12] P:1740.07 E:0.112685 |  I think it could be a left-footed Luke Shaw to the back post for Harry Maguire.
[1066.12 - 1071.92] P:1752.71 E:0.098435 |  If you look at the match-up of the back post, whether or not that's going to get floated to that back post area...
[1072.44 - 1075.24] P:1627.29 E:0.099748 |  We've got everything but a white board for this one.
[1075.76 - 1080.16] P:1610.66 E:0.098340 |  Henderson and Rice and Foulden are standing in front of the ball, Shaw behind it.
[1080.16 - 1083.68] P:1801.39 E:0.094869 |  It's tapped to Rice, then Shaw curls it into the back post.
[1083.68 - 1086.56] P:1901.42 E:0.112016 |  Maguire's there, headed across, but he heads it into the side net.
[1086.56 - 1090.28] P:1924.68 E:0.112339 |  Now he's claiming that it took a touch-off and a fender,
[1090.28 - 1093.64] P:1820.60 E:0.102325 |  but the assistant on the far side is indicating that it was a goal kick.
[1093.68 - 1098.84] P:1781.39 E:0.094517 |  So Wales nil, England nil, five-live and BBC sounds, here in Doha at the World Cup.
[1098.84 - 1103.12] P:1812.60 E:0.094037 |  And Jane Ludlow is watching from, well, a little further away, Jane.
[1103.52 - 1106.12] P:1800.12 E:0.103981 |  Yeah, just a little bit further away, Manchester, but look,
[1106.12 - 1108.88] P:1834.18 E:0.104045 |  I was expecting a bit more then, guys, to be fair.
[1108.88 - 1112.12] P:1734.80 E:0.091570 |  That set-up of the set-play, I was expecting something unusual.
[1112.12 - 1116.04] P:1819.28 E:0.091511 |  And look, thankfully for the Welsh team that, you know, we've ended up here,
[1116.04 - 1117.76] P:1695.56 E:0.104312 |  and it fell easy at the end of it.
[1117.76 - 1120.44] P:1724.08 E:0.090563 |  But we're living a little bit dangerously, look.
[1120.44 - 1122.80] P:1870.85 E:0.086881 |  England have so much possession, I guess.
[1122.84 - 1126.04] P:1911.16 E:0.103307 |  As long as there's that clean sheet for us, we've still got a chance.
[1126.04 - 1127.56] P:1932.59 E:0.099180 |  And that's how I'm looking at this game right now,
[1127.56 - 1129.56] P:1905.41 E:0.080081 |  because we can't get hold of the ball at the moment.
[1129.56 - 1132.52] P:1825.89 E:0.085984 |  You know, Wales must win, or they're going home after this.
[1132.52 - 1135.12] P:1798.06 E:0.093887 |  And they also need Iran and USA to draw.
[1135.12 - 1138.68] P:1749.47 E:0.094736 |  So they're doing that a bit. Iran nil, USA nil.
[1138.68 - 1141.08] P:1787.70 E:0.102350 |  And Stone's putting the ball out of play for a throw,
[1141.08 - 1143.08] P:1891.39 E:0.116311 |  but Wales have been forced back into their own half
[1143.08 - 1145.52] P:1932.24 E:0.092228 |  and actually struggling to keep that in,
[1145.52 - 1148.36] P:1874.09 E:0.099621 |  was Ben Davis, who stretched and played it back to Ward,
[1148.36 - 1151.48] P:1926.45 E:0.099938 |  who's put under pressure, so his clearance is onto the head of Shaw.
[1151.52 - 1153.20] P:1844.61 E:0.095016 |  And now Dalligan was very nearly in there,
[1153.20 - 1154.80] P:1817.25 E:0.073755 |  but he was beaten to it by Mepper.
[1154.80 - 1158.60] P:1741.82 E:0.079963 |  Currently England with 75% possession.
[1158.60 - 1161.84] P:1742.75 E:0.094167 |  And England with it again, halfway inside their own half.
[1161.84 - 1165.76] P:1797.03 E:0.101736 |  So Wales nil, England nil, and Conor McNamara watching the other match.
[1165.76 - 1167.96] P:1713.80 E:0.109392 |  It is still Iran nil, USA nil.
[1167.96 - 1169.48] P:1667.98 E:0.108684 |  It's been all USA so far.
[1169.48 - 1170.96] P:1659.88 E:0.090102 |  The best attempt on target,
[1170.96 - 1173.08] P:1641.21 E:0.098558 |  ahead of from Christian Pulisic that was saved.
[1173.08 - 1174.76] P:1466.04 E:0.106372 |  Iran can still top the group.
[1174.76 - 1176.32] P:1756.22 E:0.096528 |  Even a draw might be enough to see them through,
[1176.32 - 1179.24] P:1571.31 E:0.104458 |  but for USA only a win is going to be enough for them.
[1179.24 - 1180.96] P:1831.57 E:0.086038 |  Nil, nil for the moment.
[1180.96 - 1184.40] P:1721.17 E:0.098684 |  Just to repeat, it is possible that England and Wales
[1184.40 - 1186.24] P:1815.03 E:0.093423 |  could both go through tonight.
[1187.68 - 1189.04] P:1801.27 E:0.081555 |  20 minutes play.
[1189.04 - 1191.40] P:1663.97 E:0.076174 |  Wales nil, England nil.
[1191.40 - 1193.56] P:1750.91 E:0.098491 |  And Stones and Maguire again,
[1193.56 - 1198.12] P:1854.92 E:0.101919 |  who they must be topping the passing statistics at the moment.
[1198.12 - 1201.12] P:1761.97 E:0.095597 |  Stones and Maguire, we've seen them constantly,
[1201.12 - 1203.08] P:1891.40 E:0.096005 |  knocked with all to one another.
[1203.08 - 1205.16] P:1917.26 E:0.099964 |  Tickford will hit this long,
[1205.16 - 1207.68] P:1869.80 E:0.091730 |  and he will hit it onto the head of Mepper,
[1207.68 - 1210.24] P:1827.37 E:0.098387 |  who heads it forward, then Joellen nods it on,
[1210.24 - 1212.04] P:1860.19 E:0.103971 |  but it's headed forward for England by Stones.
[1212.04 - 1215.76] P:1907.68 E:0.095511 |  Rashford gamble there, it was just clear away,
[1215.76 - 1217.36] P:1799.70 E:0.106964 |  near the edge of the penalty area,
[1217.36 - 1221.08] P:1950.12 E:0.108318 |  and Walker misses his kick against Kipa Mua,
[1221.08 - 1225.04] P:1775.53 E:0.092202 |  who puts in the challenge, sends Walker sprawling at its England ball.
[1225.04 - 1226.48] P:1618.79 E:0.110971 |  It's a little bit of indecision there,
[1226.48 - 1228.88] P:1669.03 E:0.101564 |  wasn't there between Kair Walker and John Stones?
[1228.88 - 1230.04] P:1792.65 E:0.105041 |  The ball bounced between them,
[1230.04 - 1231.64] P:1703.04 E:0.087811 |  and it's kind of like equal distance,
[1231.64 - 1235.04] P:1868.62 E:0.096825 |  and neither one really took control of the situation.
[1235.04 - 1239.16] P:1832.64 E:0.099977 |  Then Kair Walker had to have a little acceleration to deal with the ball,
[1239.20 - 1244.36] P:1958.41 E:0.088713 |  gets there first, and Kipa Mua goes to the ground and makes the foul.
[1244.36 - 1246.12] P:1897.81 E:0.104143 |  But you're absolutely right, John,
[1246.12 - 1248.16] P:1626.09 E:0.107692 |  in terms of wearing England and having a lot of the ball
[1248.16 - 1250.40] P:1687.89 E:0.080997 |  between the two centre-backs.
[1250.40 - 1252.92] P:1674.82 E:0.111497 |  It's not where you want the ball, you need to be a bit more progressive,
[1252.92 - 1256.20] P:1726.06 E:0.094325 |  and I know it can be difficult if Wales are going to drop off and sit
[1256.20 - 1260.08] P:1885.44 E:0.077765 |  and try and make life difficult to break them down.
[1260.08 - 1261.40] P:1806.41 E:0.104563 |  You've got to try and find a different way,
[1261.40 - 1263.32] P:1841.27 E:0.107467 |  whether or not that is into the front a little bit more,
[1263.32 - 1265.32] P:1914.59 E:0.109561 |  and just getting Harry Kane more involved,
[1265.32 - 1269.04] P:1940.14 E:0.095595 |  with little balls clipped over the top, or put it into his feet.
[1269.08 - 1271.72] P:1832.52 E:0.103043 |  Rashford to Rice, and then Rice up towards Foden,
[1271.72 - 1274.64] P:1806.83 E:0.096926 |  who lays it off instantly to the right-hand side to Walker.
[1274.64 - 1277.36] P:1779.74 E:0.098052 |  Walker uses Henderson, he takes a couple of touches,
[1277.36 - 1280.48] P:1798.59 E:0.091605 |  then back to the right-hand side, and Kyle Walker,
[1280.48 - 1283.64] P:1864.93 E:0.088698 |  winning his 71st cap tonight,
[1283.64 - 1286.68] P:1882.93 E:0.098396 |  and it's all the way back to Maguire.
[1286.68 - 1290.72] P:1797.88 E:0.097069 |  Touch from Rice, now taken out to the left-hand side,
[1290.72 - 1293.76] P:1884.38 E:0.105718 |  Shaw, and then Rice again, who's on the left wing,
[1293.76 - 1296.92] P:1867.82 E:0.095001 |  plays it in field, a touch from Rashford back to Shaw,
[1296.96 - 1299.60] P:1787.78 E:0.104577 |  gets it onto his left foot, and then swings the ball in.
[1299.60 - 1302.68] P:1904.07 E:0.104165 |  Henderson, but it bounced awkwardly and bounced up.
[1302.68 - 1304.56] P:1832.96 E:0.103665 |  Took a touch off his head, he did well in the end,
[1304.56 - 1306.24] P:1876.13 E:0.094925 |  to keep it in on the far side.
[1306.24 - 1309.40] P:1892.74 E:0.097608 |  Walker in field, Rice is there, he's got some space.
[1309.40 - 1311.08] P:1880.57 E:0.091935 |  He takes it out to the right-hand side,
[1311.08 - 1312.40] P:1706.29 E:0.117598 |  and then slips it to the right,
[1312.40 - 1316.12] P:1926.27 E:0.105806 |  and Henderson's ball across is played away in the middle by Meatham,
[1316.12 - 1318.32] P:1937.40 E:0.112671 |  and out for a throw down the right, and England there,
[1318.32 - 1320.40] P:1926.00 E:0.106091 |  were stretching Wales, finding spaces.
[1320.40 - 1322.84] P:1910.39 E:0.109147 |  I'm surprised Harry Kane did really react.
[1322.84 - 1325.40] P:1951.60 E:0.108910 |  The moment that ball got played back into Henderson,
[1325.40 - 1327.28] P:1913.18 E:0.105367 |  he didn't make that run across the defender,
[1327.28 - 1330.20] P:1899.14 E:0.108643 |  he almost just stayed on his heels around the penalty spot,
[1330.20 - 1331.32] P:1786.53 E:0.108485 |  and he was easily dealt with,
[1331.32 - 1333.72] P:1880.29 E:0.095418 |  but it was a good position Jordan Henderson was in.
[1333.72 - 1335.48] P:1951.34 E:0.102371 |  He'd really got to that byline,
[1335.48 - 1338.72] P:1864.13 E:0.093905 |  and he had the free range just to pick someone out in the 18-yard box.
[1338.72 - 1342.32] P:1690.12 E:0.082351 |  And then Henderson is fouled on the far side, near the corner flag,
[1342.32 - 1345.12] P:1720.51 E:0.090002 |  by Ben Davis, so it's a free kick to England,
[1345.12 - 1348.32] P:1642.19 E:0.093460 |  just about eight or 10 yards back from the corner flag on the right-hand side,
[1348.32 - 1350.40] P:1735.01 E:0.097134 |  not too far away from all of those red shirts,
[1350.40 - 1352.20] P:1796.14 E:0.072708 |  with the Welsh dragon on them,
[1352.20 - 1355.48] P:1848.41 E:0.084904 |  and a free kick to be played in.
[1355.48 - 1357.76] P:1785.92 E:0.095516 |  So, up comes Maguire again.
[1357.76 - 1360.92] P:1809.90 E:0.087517 |  Harry Kane takes up a position at the back post,
[1360.92 - 1365.36] P:1761.27 E:0.090346 |  Declan Rice and Bellingham near the penalty spot.
[1365.36 - 1369.92] P:1816.63 E:0.103993 |  So, Wales bringing Keatham, who were back in there as well,
[1369.92 - 1377.12] P:1827.13 E:0.097158 |  at the far side of the penalty area, near the near post, as we look.
[1377.12 - 1378.76] P:1842.54 E:0.105376 |  So the free kick is played in,
[1378.80 - 1381.60] P:1869.41 E:0.092237 |  by Henderson, Maguire couldn't reach it,
[1381.60 - 1383.92] P:1882.85 E:0.101234 |  and now Rashford has to keep it in,
[1383.92 - 1385.32] P:1774.16 E:0.095273 |  which he does on the left-hand side,
[1385.32 - 1388.76] P:1814.53 E:0.096741 |  and Rashford will take on Joellen and shoot Galvez,
[1388.76 - 1391.48] P:1924.83 E:0.095462 |  and that is headed away by Nico Williams,
[1391.48 - 1395.28] P:1865.02 E:0.100400 |  who took that right on the forehead with his knees bent,
[1395.28 - 1397.28] P:1767.85 E:0.106094 |  and it's actually knocked him over backwards,
[1397.28 - 1399.40] P:1905.90 E:0.088125 |  and the referee's immediately stopped play.
[1399.40 - 1402.92] P:1769.65 E:0.102189 |  For the best place to take that ball is on the forehead at that speed.
[1402.92 - 1405.92] P:1856.80 E:0.079548 |  When it hits you on the top of the head, that's when...
[1405.92 - 1407.76] P:1861.34 E:0.111823 |  you start to get a little bit starry-eyed,
[1407.76 - 1409.76] P:1802.96 E:0.069950 |  but it did... Maybe it did.
[1409.76 - 1411.92] P:1747.00 E:0.100912 |  I think it just dipped his head down, didn't it?
[1411.92 - 1415.32] P:1855.29 E:0.094414 |  So if it catches you on the forehead, you're kind of hardened to deal with that,
[1415.32 - 1417.32] P:1822.62 E:0.080855 |  a lot better than when it's on the top,
[1417.32 - 1421.32] P:1742.55 E:0.090270 |  and that's why you kind of reel backwards once the ball had hit him.
[1421.32 - 1425.16] P:1803.14 E:0.106133 |  Really was travelling for Marcus Rashford, it was a long-range shot,
[1425.16 - 1427.16] P:1890.64 E:0.115614 |  hitting straight in the head, full-on.
[1427.16 - 1429.64] P:1928.19 E:0.101900 |  He's going to need a little bit of treatment here.
[1429.64 - 1432.56] P:1843.50 E:0.117794 |  So we have played a quarter of the match now,
[1432.56 - 1435.20] P:1773.55 E:0.111390 |  with the first quarter is over, just the one chance, really.
[1435.20 - 1436.92] P:1845.17 E:0.113675 |  I would say one direct chance,
[1436.92 - 1439.16] P:1918.51 E:0.106637 |  the opportunity that Rashford had through the middle.
[1439.16 - 1444.00] P:1776.04 E:0.103935 |  Let's see what Jane Ludlow, former Wales manager, has made of that first quarter.
[1444.00 - 1447.40] P:1795.44 E:0.109979 |  Well, the positives for Wales are there is still nil-nil.
[1447.40 - 1450.44] P:1823.31 E:0.100005 |  There's been huge possession for England,
[1450.44 - 1452.64] P:1845.02 E:0.107055 |  and had a couple of chances in and around the box,
[1452.64 - 1455.08] P:1829.84 E:0.112265 |  but nothing, obviously, apart from the great chance early on,
[1455.08 - 1457.84] P:1868.11 E:0.100085 |  which Danny Ward did very well to save.
[1457.84 - 1461.40] P:1897.95 E:0.106140 |  So in that sense, I think Wales are doing pretty well.
[1461.40 - 1465.12] P:1855.05 E:0.104968 |  No quarter of the match in, and nil-nil, it's a good start for us,
[1465.12 - 1468.52] P:1777.83 E:0.094894 |  but ideally, we'd like a little bit more of the ball
[1468.52 - 1471.52] P:1764.80 E:0.087572 |  to actually threaten England when we actually do have the ball
[1471.52 - 1473.68] P:1817.08 E:0.066808 |  and retain the ball better.
[1473.68 - 1478.16] P:1786.10 E:0.092445 |  Thank you, Jane. So far, we've seen almost nothing from Gareth Bale.
[1478.16 - 1479.92] P:1801.03 E:0.093990 |  Now, it's represented in the stats.
[1479.92 - 1483.44] P:1601.40 E:0.098536 |  I mean, it's interesting how they have the stats on the little screen here, isn't it,
[1483.44 - 1486.48] P:1850.36 E:0.097839 |  because you get the ball in contest for a percentage,
[1486.48 - 1490.24] P:1863.11 E:0.103308 |  so it can be a bit misleading, but I'm looking at Wales' possession stats,
[1490.24 - 1494.40] P:1699.27 E:0.100680 |  and what is that, John? 19% of the game so far.
[1494.68 - 1497.84] P:1660.55 E:0.099828 |  It's very difficult to score a goal when you have the ball that little,
[1497.84 - 1500.28] P:1656.46 E:0.097716 |  and like you said, Wales need that goal.
[1500.28 - 1504.84] P:1690.00 E:0.100781 |  They need to win this game, so by somehow, they have to get hold of the ball.
[1506.12 - 1510.04] P:1758.06 E:0.097170 |  We also have Juliette Carrington, who's down pitch save behind the goal.
[1510.04 - 1512.04] P:1819.65 E:0.086347 |  And the England dead, Juliette.
[1512.04 - 1517.44] P:1805.96 E:0.100527 |  We've just had a rendition of the national anthem from the England fans behind me.
[1517.44 - 1519.40] P:1799.33 E:0.088152 |  I've got to say, it's gone a little bit flat.
[1519.40 - 1523.80] P:1850.40 E:0.092095 |  I think that just reflects the performance so far that we're seeing,
[1523.80 - 1526.52] P:1841.61 E:0.099700 |  you know, an England controlling possession, as you say,
[1526.52 - 1528.56] P:1700.87 E:0.096553 |  but it's been fairly conservative so far.
[1528.56 - 1531.32] P:1889.63 E:0.094683 |  Chesney Hawks, though, does seem to be enjoying it on my left.
[1531.32 - 1535.60] P:1691.47 E:0.088673 |  He's going to be performing at halftime, as we know.
[1536.32 - 1538.24] P:1812.20 E:0.098648 |  Yes, Mike Corvidge, I like it.
[1538.24 - 1540.32] P:1708.62 E:0.103728 |  Well, Mark Chapman's home, which is looking forward to that,
[1540.32 - 1542.12] P:1618.92 E:0.095291 |  and Mike, maybe left side.
[1542.12 - 1543.92] P:1639.69 E:0.103233 |  He's just looking so excited.
[1543.92 - 1545.16] P:1721.94 E:0.121522 |  He's sitting to my right.
[1545.16 - 1546.40] P:1989.70 E:0.088390 |  He can run to it.
[1546.40 - 1548.24] P:1713.52 E:0.114258 |  Here's Maguire carrying the ball forward.
[1548.24 - 1550.36] P:1808.84 E:0.102445 |  Shaw, the Rashford on the left-hand side,
[1550.36 - 1552.72] P:1808.68 E:0.100794 |  he comes to challenge two Welsh players on him,
[1552.76 - 1555.40] P:1785.57 E:0.107572 |  and it is thrown away and taken away by Nico Williams,
[1555.40 - 1561.00] P:1870.28 E:0.114240 |  who is back on the field after being checked out and checked over.
[1561.00 - 1563.84] P:1741.05 E:0.093436 |  He's OK, but keep him low, can't keep the ball in,
[1563.84 - 1567.76] P:1929.44 E:0.098895 |  and it's a throw into England, almost right on the halfway line.
[1567.76 - 1572.24] P:1848.89 E:0.104362 |  So, Nil Nil, get another update on Iran, USA.
[1572.24 - 1574.92] P:1799.13 E:0.099800 |  Let's do that now, as the ball is blocked out for another England throw.
[1574.92 - 1575.44] P:1944.23 E:0.074817 |  Connor.
[1575.44 - 1577.88] P:1744.86 E:0.110228 |  26 minutes played, Iran Nil, USA Nil.
[1577.88 - 1580.08] P:1784.34 E:0.093102 |  Iran have had their first attack of the game.
[1580.08 - 1583.36] P:1659.84 E:0.101062 |  And Taeremi into the penalty area, was surprised he didn't take it on himself.
[1583.36 - 1585.92] P:1634.01 E:0.100777 |  He was unselfish, he tried to lay it back for Osmoon,
[1585.92 - 1588.16] P:1692.61 E:0.095497 |  but the USA got too many defenders back there.
[1588.16 - 1591.68] P:1624.86 E:0.094805 |  There's only been the one shot on target from the game from Pulisic.
[1591.68 - 1593.92] P:1638.47 E:0.083967 |  It's Iran Nil, USA Nil.
[1593.92 - 1597.68] P:1699.97 E:0.090047 |  So, it is currently England going through as group winners,
[1597.68 - 1601.56] P:1798.32 E:0.100179 |  and Iran has run us up, as the table was at the start of play.
[1601.56 - 1604.00] P:1870.67 E:0.098389 |  England play the ball down the right wing,
[1604.00 - 1607.08] P:1921.60 E:0.092168 |  and a foul on Ben Davis,
[1607.08 - 1609.72] P:1753.86 E:0.097003 |  and it is a free kick to Wales down there,
[1609.72 - 1612.80] P:1885.35 E:0.097029 |  just a great deal of contact from Phil Forden,
[1612.80 - 1615.20] P:1863.77 E:0.084546 |  but enough to draw the foul and a free kick.
[1615.20 - 1619.52] P:1883.12 E:0.088951 |  So, what do you reckon, Matt, from a Welsh point of view so far?
[1619.52 - 1622.00] P:1906.50 E:0.073380 |  And is this better from England?
[1623.24 - 1626.28] P:1768.67 E:0.082578 |  Not yet, for me, and I think it's better.
[1626.28 - 1629.12] P:1767.77 E:0.094507 |  We haven't got into a rhythm, we've had a lot of possession,
[1629.12 - 1632.72] P:1761.56 E:0.100043 |  but that's mainly due to the fact that Wales haven't been able to keep the ball,
[1632.72 - 1635.12] P:1779.81 E:0.094329 |  and then once we have the ball, they're kind of sitting in their shape.
[1635.12 - 1638.28] P:1874.28 E:0.093468 |  So, we're able to control large parts of the game,
[1638.28 - 1640.48] P:1856.33 E:0.105661 |  but in and around our own half or on the half-way line.
[1640.48 - 1645.08] P:1913.89 E:0.109096 |  But I haven't seen us really clip yet or connect anything like the first game
[1645.08 - 1648.44] P:1896.05 E:0.091365 |  in terms of combinations of movement and passing.
[1648.44 - 1651.24] P:1827.30 E:0.108854 |  We haven't really opened Wales up other than that chance,
[1651.24 - 1655.04] P:1822.22 E:0.095476 |  which came from a turnover, brilliant piece of anticipation from Declan Rice,
[1655.04 - 1657.36] P:1833.59 E:0.102770 |  who won the ball in the attack in half.
[1657.36 - 1660.88] P:1832.01 E:0.092386 |  So, yeah, I think England, you know, a lot to improve on,
[1660.88 - 1663.52] P:1632.13 E:0.092257 |  in terms of having possession and being a threat with the ball.
[1663.52 - 1666.96] P:1654.99 E:0.098264 |  And Gwaiar putting it out of play, clearing it from near the edge of the penalty area.
[1666.96 - 1670.24] P:1535.75 E:0.095554 |  Still Wales, England 0-5-5, BBC Senate.
[1670.24 - 1674.88] P:1637.44 E:0.099962 |  Now, yes, Kefamua against Rice, 25 yards from the England goal,
[1674.88 - 1678.16] P:1821.19 E:0.097902 |  surrounded by England players, Bellingham got the important touches,
[1678.16 - 1679.76] P:1843.86 E:0.107094 |  played up into the centre-circle,
[1679.76 - 1684.92] P:1972.34 E:0.107365 |  and then Kane is able to latch onto the loose ball after Bellingham was challenged.
[1684.92 - 1686.96] P:1941.86 E:0.111739 |  That plays it forward, gives it back to Wales,
[1686.96 - 1692.76] P:1925.72 E:0.109855 |  and Williams is now bringing it forward, and he's leaned into and fouled by Jordan Henderson.
[1692.80 - 1697.08] P:1791.62 E:0.096361 |  As it says, he's all captain, who then almost lands on top of him,
[1697.08 - 1698.88] P:1838.75 E:0.084847 |  gives him a pat on the backside,
[1698.88 - 1703.36] P:1860.41 E:0.091839 |  and that isn't going to get him off a ticking off from referee Vintcourt.
[1703.36 - 1705.48] P:1717.02 E:0.089273 |  Ah, it was Clumsy from Jordan Henderson.
[1705.48 - 1708.40] P:1851.27 E:0.081663 |  He's never going to get the right side of Nico Williams.
[1708.40 - 1712.24] P:1764.35 E:0.097880 |  I mean, Harry Kane, he's got to try and release that ball a little bit earlier, a moment ago.
[1712.24 - 1717.92] P:1825.51 E:0.078185 |  It was a great tackle from Aaron Ramsey recovering into that area of the pitch,
[1717.92 - 1721.16] P:1761.63 E:0.103016 |  but the foul from Jordan Henderson puts him in a little bit of position now, doesn't it?
[1721.16 - 1722.68] P:1888.69 E:0.075281 |  He's got to be careful.
[1723.84 - 1725.68] P:1866.50 E:0.117667 |  It's good to see a couple of tackles, though, John.
[1725.68 - 1729.24] P:1813.10 E:0.101713 |  Well, Dan James has caught John Stones with a late one there, actually.
[1729.24 - 1732.36] P:1779.64 E:0.093248 |  It's good to see a bit of tackling going, it's been a little bit flat, isn't it,
[1732.36 - 1736.76] P:1814.10 E:0.093025 |  in terms of incident, and if you're not going to have too much quality with the ball in the opening stages,
[1736.76 - 1739.92] P:1898.23 E:0.100272 |  you want to see a bit of that fire and the tackles going in,
[1739.92 - 1742.00] P:1758.87 E:0.098355 |  and we're starting to see that a little bit more in the game.
[1742.00 - 1744.32] P:1883.26 E:0.084549 |  And there we are, the first yellow card, Dan James.
[1744.32 - 1746.40] P:1814.82 E:0.087222 |  It was late, it was late for John.
[1746.40 - 1751.12] P:1816.87 E:0.084271 |  It was, and I think it was, like you said, the third tackle in the space of a minute or two.
[1751.24 - 1753.20] P:1806.07 E:0.092513 |  And the referee's got the yellow card out.
[1753.76 - 1758.56] P:1843.10 E:0.080955 |  So almost half an hour played, not a very good game, must be said.
[1758.96 - 1760.88] P:1720.33 E:0.090481 |  It's not a thrill at by any means.
[1761.28 - 1763.76] P:1699.53 E:0.108732 |  It's a little bit like the games I used to watch when I was growing up,
[1763.76 - 1770.20] P:1799.31 E:0.087013 |  between Wales and England, many of them, in the home nation's championship,
[1771.16 - 1774.72] P:1845.89 E:0.091908 |  when very often, people forget, you know, very often you hear people say,
[1774.72 - 1777.32] P:1754.28 E:0.082573 |  oh, wouldn't it be great to bring back the home internationals?
[1777.32 - 1779.56] P:1869.34 E:0.101242 |  Actually, many of them were rubbish.
[1780.56 - 1782.76] P:1881.57 E:0.094672 |  Here's Stone.
[1782.76 - 1784.88] P:1740.46 E:0.084600 |  We can crowbar a couple into the schedule.
[1785.88 - 1787.64] P:1672.09 E:0.100829 |  There's not enough games going on.
[1790.12 - 1791.88] P:1887.52 E:0.110420 |  A flight meeting's closed, didn't it?
[1791.88 - 1795.48] P:1859.11 E:0.088688 |  Both played by Stone, out towards the far side, kept in,
[1795.48 - 1799.28] P:1843.83 E:0.081317 |  and then worked back out to the left-hand side.
[1799.28 - 1802.12] P:1788.00 E:0.099692 |  James is there, walkers with him, shoulder to shoulder,
[1802.12 - 1804.20] P:1898.66 E:0.086479 |  and then Bellingham takes all back.
[1804.20 - 1807.48] P:1920.15 E:0.083339 |  Not seeing too much of Jude Bellingham yet in this match.
[1807.52 - 1809.60] P:1910.69 E:0.070260 |  20th cap tonight.
[1809.60 - 1813.64] P:1743.29 E:0.091507 |  The youngest man to win 20 caps for England, since Wayne Rooney.
[1813.64 - 1815.40] P:1906.78 E:0.091794 |  It's a different role for him, isn't it?
[1815.40 - 1817.40] P:1999.00 E:0.111302 |  He's just playing a little bit higher up the pitch.
[1817.40 - 1820.28] P:1838.33 E:0.104295 |  He's got Declan Rice and Henderson operating in that area,
[1820.28 - 1821.72] P:1785.84 E:0.102317 |  where he normally likes to be,
[1821.72 - 1824.56] P:1779.05 E:0.095508 |  and then making those surging runs from a bit deeper at the moment.
[1824.56 - 1827.24] P:1941.78 E:0.090729 |  He's just picked the ball up in, like, a number 10 position,
[1827.24 - 1828.72] P:1936.31 E:0.080581 |  with his back to goal.
[1828.72 - 1830.12] P:1867.47 E:0.093155 |  It's a different requirement for him.
[1830.12 - 1830.84] P:1730.91 E:0.079245 |  That was better.
[1830.84 - 1833.56] P:1800.98 E:0.094758 |  He was watching him because you were talking about him, and he called for it.
[1833.56 - 1834.24] P:1997.45 E:0.082137 |  Got it.
[1834.24 - 1836.04] P:1807.21 E:0.094031 |  England's still with it on the right-hand side.
[1836.04 - 1837.32] P:1859.56 E:0.089664 |  Here is Foden, turns.
[1837.36 - 1838.88] P:1890.13 E:0.068754 |  He's full of energy, Foden.
[1838.88 - 1841.72] P:1754.67 E:0.089134 |  Then back to Walker, back to Rice, 30 yards out.
[1841.72 - 1843.64] P:1824.41 E:0.075315 |  Challenge comes in from Keefa Mua,
[1843.64 - 1845.36] P:1621.43 E:0.093366 |  but back to Henderson on the right-hand side.
[1845.36 - 1847.20] P:1611.64 E:0.081350 |  Foden and Henderson there together.
[1847.20 - 1848.40] P:1680.04 E:0.084043 |  Henderson receives it.
[1848.40 - 1850.64] P:1569.64 E:0.086801 |  Now back to Rice, black hair bobbing,
[1850.64 - 1852.60] P:1783.66 E:0.098033 |  as he does so across to Harry Maguire,
[1852.60 - 1854.36] P:1722.32 E:0.090900 |  who's going to have a little wander forward,
[1854.36 - 1856.28] P:1869.89 E:0.096066 |  and he does towards the corner of the penalty area.
[1856.28 - 1858.64] P:1917.06 E:0.105356 |  He's now into the box, and he drives it across.
[1858.64 - 1861.44] P:1965.00 E:0.103306 |  I think he was going for goal, and he may hit it,
[1861.44 - 1862.88] P:1941.31 E:0.101709 |  and it's actually out for a throwing.
[1862.88 - 1865.88] P:1929.26 E:0.099370 |  I thought it looked like a deflection from Harry Maguire there
[1865.92 - 1867.20] P:1930.73 E:0.074854 |  when he hit this ball.
[1867.20 - 1870.44] P:1856.75 E:0.093278 |  He does those drives forward, which I quite like.
[1870.44 - 1874.12] P:1856.60 E:0.092905 |  He carries the ball really well, and he gets it onto his left foot.
[1874.12 - 1876.52] P:1875.83 E:0.088081 |  Maybe she should just pop it wide at that point
[1876.52 - 1878.60] P:1826.74 E:0.102066 |  and allow whoever's out there just to try and cross the ball.
[1878.60 - 1881.24] P:1892.46 E:0.090214 |  But he tries to just almost fire it across the goal.
[1881.24 - 1882.84] P:1934.79 E:0.074468 |  I don't think it was a shot.
[1882.84 - 1884.96] P:1835.45 E:0.097570 |  It goes out for a throwing on the far side.
[1885.68 - 1886.88] P:1824.26 E:0.095982 |  Yep, that won't be it.
[1886.88 - 1889.84] P:1709.72 E:0.092417 |  I want me to get the pen out for that one either.
[1889.84 - 1895.64] P:1841.26 E:0.079478 |  So just the one note that I've made, the Rashford chance early on in the game.
[1895.68 - 1896.96] P:1573.30 E:0.104439 |  Henderson hooking it over the top.
[1896.96 - 1900.16] P:1747.12 E:0.094781 |  That's way beyond anyone in a white shirt, and Wales have got it at the back.
[1900.16 - 1902.32] P:1832.10 E:0.085584 |  Let's bring in Jane Ludlow again.
[1903.52 - 1907.32] P:1595.35 E:0.110752 |  Well, it's not the game that keeps you on the edge of your seat right now, guys, is it?
[1907.32 - 1910.52] P:1734.58 E:0.077704 |  But from a Welsh perspective, it's great, it's 0-0 still.
[1910.52 - 1912.68] P:1765.67 E:0.075615 |  It keeps the team in with a chance.
[1912.68 - 1916.00] P:1763.90 E:0.093841 |  From an England perspective, quality could be better in the final third,
[1916.00 - 1918.24] P:1588.09 E:0.090422 |  but Wales fans will be happy that it's not right now.
[1919.48 - 1923.52] P:1908.54 E:0.098511 |  No, I don't think at the moment, if Netherlands and Senegal now have to,
[1923.56 - 1925.80] P:1816.72 E:0.080990 |  after winning the group and finishing runners-up
[1925.80 - 1928.36] P:1875.03 E:0.073177 |  and knowing that they'll play the teams from this section,
[1928.36 - 1930.76] P:1792.36 E:0.092614 |  they're not going to be quaking in their boots watching this.
[1930.76 - 1934.84] P:1746.77 E:0.094018 |  I think Jane's spot on is not the most riveting game I've ever seen,
[1934.84 - 1937.92] P:1857.70 E:0.084175 |  and need a team England as well,
[1937.92 - 1941.96] P:1816.35 E:0.092340 |  and not playing particularly well in terms of looking at a threat
[1941.96 - 1944.72] P:1853.40 E:0.093174 |  or looking any kind of danger with the ball.
[1944.72 - 1946.68] P:1893.27 E:0.074642 |  And there's a lot of possession in that.
[1946.68 - 1950.68] P:1776.73 E:0.085667 |  I keep saying I know Wales are trying to make life difficult,
[1950.68 - 1952.36] P:1686.01 E:0.093752 |  sitting in there, not allowing too much space.
[1952.36 - 1953.76] P:1637.69 E:0.095342 |  But England have to do more.
[1953.76 - 1957.32] P:1838.65 E:0.089214 |  We have to have more movement off the ball and interchanging position
[1957.32 - 1962.44] P:1852.86 E:0.090872 |  and try and run in behind or be more direct, whatever it needs.
[1962.44 - 1964.12] P:1640.87 E:0.078815 |  It needs something a bit different.
[1964.12 - 1966.76] P:1900.25 E:0.082054 |  But remember, England's objective here,
[1966.76 - 1969.68] P:1941.69 E:0.088060 |  their first objective at this World Cup,
[1969.68 - 1971.36] P:1920.58 E:0.099993 |  was to finish top of this group.
[1972.60 - 1975.08] P:1831.37 E:0.100259 |  So let's see where things are at the end of the night.
[1976.00 - 1977.96] P:1925.90 E:0.093517 |  Here's Rice back to Thordon.
[1977.96 - 1981.04] P:1783.37 E:0.087071 |  Thordon, and to Rice again, that'll go through to Henderson.
[1981.08 - 1985.08] P:1920.54 E:0.099262 |  Rice, once more, England keeping possession, moving it forward.
[1985.08 - 1987.16] P:1830.68 E:0.093961 |  Walker with the cross, that's headed away.
[1987.16 - 1989.44] P:1926.40 E:0.070561 |  It was right onto the head of Meppen,
[1989.44 - 1991.68] P:1896.99 E:0.106139 |  who is headed out over on the far side.
[1991.68 - 1994.24] P:1813.54 E:0.105578 |  It's roll to England, halfway inside the half,
[1994.24 - 1999.04] P:1856.73 E:0.105548 |  and Nico Williams has sat down now on the edge of the area.
[1999.04 - 2000.84] P:1883.66 E:0.103893 |  I didn't see him receiving a knock,
[2000.84 - 2003.04] P:1905.48 E:0.103434 |  and referee is pointing to his head,
[2003.04 - 2005.28] P:1876.83 E:0.102888 |  and it looks as though he is dazed after being hit.
[2005.28 - 2009.24] P:1806.38 E:0.087069 |  I think it was on the top of the head by the shot from...
[2009.24 - 2010.04] P:1882.34 E:0.055890 |  Was it Rashford?
[2010.08 - 2011.28] P:1877.34 E:0.084131 |  It was Rashford, yeah.
[2011.28 - 2012.44] P:1795.10 E:0.076396 |  On his right foot.
[2012.44 - 2015.08] P:1814.95 E:0.088026 |  And he's not... It looks as though he is struggling,
[2015.08 - 2017.76] P:1868.15 E:0.081049 |  whether there's a bit of double vision,
[2017.76 - 2023.76] P:1868.43 E:0.085388 |  what it is, he sat down, he's talking to the two medical men
[2023.76 - 2026.60] P:1842.74 E:0.080448 |  from Wales, and they're chatting,
[2026.60 - 2028.96] P:1761.14 E:0.095710 |  and they're giving him a slurp of water.
[2028.96 - 2032.36] P:1875.66 E:0.091345 |  So it's another chance for the players to come across
[2032.36 - 2034.16] P:1816.23 E:0.076755 |  and receive the water bottles.
[2034.16 - 2037.44] P:1875.08 E:0.098251 |  So Luke Shaw is down there, Garret Southgate just wandering forward
[2037.44 - 2039.08] P:1913.63 E:0.101954 |  to have a little word with him.
[2039.08 - 2043.84] P:1836.49 E:0.089134 |  Well, Paige, likewise, is actually chatting with his coaching staff,
[2043.84 - 2047.32] P:1901.74 E:0.090918 |  and we will have another stoppage here.
[2047.32 - 2050.64] P:1831.95 E:0.098490 |  So it looks as though Conor Roberts is going to be prepared to come on,
[2050.64 - 2053.36] P:1817.21 E:0.090302 |  so that is going to be it for Nico Williams,
[2053.36 - 2056.60] P:1828.81 E:0.098946 |  who has moved across the players the right back, and this back four,
[2056.60 - 2059.60] P:1796.62 E:0.096049 |  and Conor Roberts, the number 14, the Burnley man,
[2059.60 - 2062.76] P:1850.96 E:0.082758 |  top of the championship, is going to come on to replacing.
[2062.76 - 2066.08] P:1808.59 E:0.099980 |  So Wales, Nail, England, Nail, 10 minutes to go to halftime,
[2066.08 - 2069.40] P:1745.77 E:0.099480 |  and what's happening in the Iran-USA game?
[2069.40 - 2070.24] P:1598.13 E:0.086501 |  Conor McNamara.
[2070.24 - 2073.80] P:1682.21 E:0.109570 |  Still Iran-Nail, USA-Nail, still the USA on top.
[2073.80 - 2075.80] P:1559.54 E:0.102000 |  They've had more passes in the final third tonight
[2075.80 - 2078.52] P:1715.66 E:0.098006 |  than in either of the games against Wales or England,
[2078.52 - 2080.08] P:1659.83 E:0.102472 |  and they've just had a big opportunity.
[2080.08 - 2083.68] P:1817.35 E:0.101471 |  Tim Ware, who scored against Wales just on the edge of the penalty area,
[2083.68 - 2084.80] P:1602.38 E:0.093859 |  two defenders in front of him,
[2084.80 - 2087.32] P:1645.07 E:0.097444 |  he absolutely went for power rather than accuracy.
[2087.32 - 2090.04] P:1736.34 E:0.097603 |  He blazed it over the top, but a good chance.
[2090.04 - 2092.92] P:1658.64 E:0.101611 |  Iran-Nail, USA-Nail, as things stand,
[2092.92 - 2096.84] P:1673.91 E:0.086370 |  the USA would be going out and Iran going through with England.
[2096.84 - 2099.28] P:1834.06 E:0.086955 |  Five-lives from the BBC.
[2099.28 - 2102.08] P:1733.39 E:0.110037 |  This was a night, final night in Group B at this World Cup,
[2102.08 - 2105.76] P:1736.16 E:0.091039 |  where you thought there could be all sorts of swings and exciting possibilities,
[2105.76 - 2108.16] P:1694.03 E:0.094758 |  and at the moment, there's not been a goal in either match,
[2108.16 - 2110.48] P:1863.64 E:0.086725 |  and it's all been rather dull.
[2110.48 - 2112.48] P:1756.95 E:0.095005 |  So Williams is still...
[2112.48 - 2113.96] P:1842.37 E:0.091753 |  He's on his feet now.
[2113.96 - 2116.88] P:1879.21 E:0.085761 |  Keep selling it, John.
[2116.88 - 2119.32] P:1744.86 E:0.120717 |  You have to speak to the three people of the world.
[2119.32 - 2120.84] P:1714.06 E:0.096885 |  No, I completely agree.
[2120.84 - 2123.16] P:1610.44 E:0.083612 |  I mean, you're kind of sitting here thinking,
[2123.16 - 2126.76] P:1782.53 E:0.093197 |  well, let's try and delve into what's going on,
[2126.76 - 2130.12] P:1934.69 E:0.108575 |  how are England playing, what's Wales' approach,
[2130.12 - 2133.08] P:1927.47 E:0.105092 |  given the fact that they have to win this game.
[2133.08 - 2135.80] P:1848.86 E:0.105992 |  And, yeah, the game isn't speaking, that, is it?
[2135.80 - 2138.36] P:1913.98 E:0.100025 |  No, it certainly is not.
[2138.36 - 2139.64] P:1876.37 E:0.113067 |  Put very well.
[2139.64 - 2144.68] P:1872.24 E:0.104107 |  So, Williams, Nico Williams is being loudly applauded off the field.
[2144.68 - 2147.16] P:1838.50 E:0.101609 |  That's a really disappointing way, isn't it?
[2147.16 - 2148.96] P:1884.65 E:0.090410 |  And a sad way for his...
[2149.92 - 2153.20] P:1941.07 E:0.102053 |  Potentially, his World Cup to come to an end.
[2153.20 - 2154.20] P:1972.63 E:0.099185 |  Jane Ludlow?
[2155.48 - 2159.00] P:1822.80 E:0.097651 |  Yeah, it's not a great way for the World Cup to end for the guy, is it?
[2159.00 - 2162.20] P:1936.73 E:0.098131 |  But, you know, the thing I'm most surprised about
[2162.20 - 2164.72] P:1909.64 E:0.103077 |  with regards to Wales set up so far in this game
[2164.72 - 2166.96] P:1648.61 E:0.108765 |  is we're working really hard to win the ball back.
[2166.96 - 2170.52] P:1766.43 E:0.089930 |  But when we win the ball back, you're expecting a quick transition,
[2170.52 - 2172.80] P:1740.51 E:0.076701 |  play longer, earlier.
[2172.80 - 2174.64] P:1752.09 E:0.095402 |  But Wales are actually looking to retain.
[2174.64 - 2176.44] P:1732.67 E:0.093918 |  Now, whether that's the game plan,
[2176.44 - 2178.64] P:1794.78 E:0.090330 |  I'd be surprised that that is the game plan.
[2179.44 - 2181.88] P:1861.51 E:0.113827 |  Long throw for England into the Welsh penalty area,
[2181.88 - 2184.56] P:1692.37 E:0.076654 |  but that's a judge who have been a foul.
[2184.56 - 2185.56] P:1382.61 E:0.110449 |  And...
[2186.60 - 2189.00] P:1600.25 E:0.097414 |  Wales win the free kick.
[2189.00 - 2193.68] P:1598.63 E:0.102174 |  And just the challenge by, well, McGuire and Stoams were both in there,
[2193.68 - 2196.32] P:1772.87 E:0.078779 |  and McGuire is penalised.
[2196.32 - 2198.52] P:1680.65 E:0.100511 |  I didn't see too much in that, John, whether or not I think it was...
[2198.52 - 2200.36] P:1922.18 E:0.091200 |  Might have been a shove from Stoams initially,
[2200.36 - 2205.48] P:1880.09 E:0.085680 |  as Keith Lemoore actually just goes clattering into Meppam, I think it is.
[2205.48 - 2207.56] P:1774.05 E:0.097536 |  Whether or not it was just a bit of contact from Stoams
[2207.56 - 2208.96] P:1707.78 E:0.085984 |  that sent him on his way.
[2210.36 - 2214.68] P:1886.23 E:0.080074 |  So Conor Roberts is on for what is his 44th cap tonight.
[2214.68 - 2218.20] P:1809.78 E:0.093196 |  And Wales, this is a rare foray forward from Wales.
[2218.20 - 2220.60] P:1833.98 E:0.109041 |  Ramsay near the edge of the box, back to Kepa Mour.
[2220.60 - 2222.68] P:1942.70 E:0.117336 |  Reiss put the challenge in, I thought he fouled him.
[2222.68 - 2223.68] P:1941.73 E:0.105239 |  I did.
[2223.68 - 2226.36] P:1923.36 E:0.096319 |  Kepa Mour, that's not given us a free kick.
[2226.36 - 2227.88] P:1808.17 E:0.114054 |  And England are quickly away on the move,
[2227.88 - 2231.08] P:1826.27 E:0.090454 |  White Shirts pouring forward, down the flanks and in the middle.
[2231.08 - 2233.20] P:1917.89 E:0.103027 |  And here's a flick from Bellingham, nice.
[2233.20 - 2235.80] P:1878.37 E:0.115892 |  And then a back heel by Walker, and Bellingham in the area,
[2235.80 - 2237.36] P:1984.98 E:0.111186 |  and Forden on the turn!
[2237.40 - 2243.32] P:1962.63 E:0.101482 |  Left foot shot, flies wide and high, beyond the far top left corner.
[2243.32 - 2246.16] P:1989.95 E:0.101279 |  But that was better, much better from England.
[2246.16 - 2250.24] P:1933.24 E:0.105317 |  Absolutely, first little flurry from England to get excited about.
[2250.24 - 2256.00] P:1923.32 E:0.100302 |  It's that man, Drew Bellingham, showing the skills and the flicks and the twirls.
[2256.00 - 2258.24] P:1927.64 E:0.107839 |  Really does swivel so well on the ball,
[2258.24 - 2263.12] P:1924.56 E:0.085368 |  it was a cheeky little back heel just to find Foden in the opposing box,
[2263.12 - 2265.84] P:1874.09 E:0.075722 |  but it just had a bit of flow to it, John, didn't it?
[2265.88 - 2267.96] P:1715.34 E:0.101586 |  The ball turned over, England broke forwards,
[2267.96 - 2271.40] P:1883.85 E:0.088062 |  and all of a sudden you've got three or four White Shirts in support,
[2271.40 - 2275.36] P:1817.63 E:0.087409 |  making runs, high energy, that's what we want to see more of.
[2275.36 - 2278.84] P:1834.36 E:0.093541 |  But Wales had a really good case for a free kick,
[2278.84 - 2281.24] P:1800.35 E:0.104878 |  Kepa Mour, which would have been in Garret Vale territory.
[2281.24 - 2283.52] P:1791.53 E:0.101512 |  I thought he'd lost the ball, John, but I thought Declan Rice
[2283.52 - 2286.24] P:1880.24 E:0.097567 |  just prodded his leg out and made contact with him.
[2286.24 - 2287.84] P:1871.69 E:0.102760 |  This is Vale, now into the action,
[2287.84 - 2291.60] P:1894.44 E:0.095571 |  could get completely past Harry Maguire,
[2291.60 - 2294.32] P:1873.46 E:0.098543 |  but still Wales in possession, Ampedou,
[2294.32 - 2297.36] P:1880.23 E:0.106017 |  now Ramsey just outside the area, gives it to Squared Allen,
[2297.36 - 2299.04] P:1895.77 E:0.109329 |  who's shot is blocked down by Rice,
[2299.04 - 2301.44] P:2017.92 E:0.104239 |  and England could be off on the counterattack again here,
[2301.44 - 2304.64] P:1956.28 E:0.105008 |  Rashford in possession, running from deep inside his own half,
[2304.64 - 2307.40] P:1882.56 E:0.089897 |  down the left wing, Conor Roberts just under the field,
[2307.40 - 2309.76] P:1899.06 E:0.084770 |  he's passed him, gives it back to Rice though,
[2309.76 - 2313.08] P:1815.08 E:0.088802 |  and Rice could have gone for the pass out to the right-hand side, Henderson,
[2313.08 - 2315.36] P:1871.32 E:0.094632 |  took a little moment there to give it the walk-out,
[2315.36 - 2318.64] P:1726.12 E:0.089715 |  and Wales are now back in position, it's Foden on the right-hand side,
[2318.64 - 2320.84] P:1860.95 E:0.094457 |  Foden low ball into the box, that's cleared,
[2320.84 - 2322.84] P:1886.03 E:0.093548 |  Henderson swills it in, takes the deflection,
[2322.88 - 2325.80] P:1958.77 E:0.100573 |  Rashford with the overhead kick,
[2325.80 - 2330.12] P:1995.55 E:0.106533 |  that would have been truly spectacular from 13-14 yards out,
[2330.12 - 2332.68] P:1946.95 E:0.092056 |  but with the bicycle kick he pulled it wide,
[2332.68 - 2334.52] P:1804.20 E:0.098074 |  of the left post by three or four yards,
[2334.52 - 2339.44] P:1820.58 E:0.074297 |  so it's 0-0 here in the Ahmed Bin Ali Stadium,
[2339.44 - 2343.16] P:1746.65 E:0.088508 |  but there has been a goal in the Iran-USA match,
[2343.16 - 2344.04] P:1579.24 E:0.103326 |  Conor McNamara.
[2344.04 - 2346.76] P:1699.66 E:0.106154 |  Yes, developments of the game, developments in the group,
[2346.76 - 2350.92] P:1834.72 E:0.107921 |  because the USA have taken the lead, Iran-0, USA won,
[2350.92 - 2355.24] P:1783.53 E:0.093424 |  Christian Pulisic finishing from close range after death-header,
[2355.24 - 2357.24] P:1769.09 E:0.108516 |  back along the edge of the six-yard box,
[2357.24 - 2359.84] P:1745.05 E:0.100283 |  Pulisic injured himself colliding with the goalkeeper,
[2359.84 - 2362.64] P:1698.55 E:0.102803 |  but the ball into the back of the net, we've seen the replays,
[2362.64 - 2364.20] P:1734.61 E:0.096126 |  there's no offside flags,
[2364.20 - 2367.60] P:1682.15 E:0.100888 |  and this will mean that the USA will be moving up the standings,
[2367.60 - 2371.52] P:1772.98 E:0.098668 |  as things stand, they go to second in Group B behind England,
[2371.52 - 2374.24] P:1615.70 E:0.102901 |  and Iran would be going out if it remains like this,
[2374.24 - 2378.36] P:1749.56 E:0.098601 |  the opening goal of the night in this group, Iran-0, USA won.
[2378.44 - 2381.12] P:1935.09 E:0.111703 |  And here's Forden for England, Forden taking it on,
[2381.12 - 2384.28] P:1955.97 E:0.103163 |  riding the challenges, giving it to Kane, now to Rashford.
[2384.28 - 2388.28] P:1978.99 E:0.098036 |  Rashford's ball across is blocked behind for a corner,
[2388.28 - 2391.24] P:1924.24 E:0.089267 |  and that again, threatened to open up for England,
[2391.24 - 2393.48] P:1891.87 E:0.100876 |  Conor Roberts blocked it behind, corner from the left.
[2393.48 - 2395.64] P:1984.02 E:0.098234 |  Yeah, it's not like intentional build-up,
[2395.64 - 2397.88] P:1944.51 E:0.101737 |  but what I like about it, it's got real purpose
[2397.88 - 2399.96] P:1936.53 E:0.102139 |  when England are going forward, Phil Foden then,
[2399.96 - 2403.04] P:1966.54 E:0.088000 |  skips past the tackle, the ball bubbles on,
[2403.04 - 2405.56] P:1859.85 E:0.095687 |  does really well to maintain it, feeds it to Kane,
[2405.56 - 2406.88] P:1917.57 E:0.095624 |  it comes out wide to Rashford,
[2406.88 - 2409.12] P:1844.46 E:0.087699 |  and I just don't think he quite selects the right pass,
[2409.12 - 2411.56] P:1838.13 E:0.090054 |  he tries to square the ball, and I think the ball
[2411.56 - 2416.12] P:1838.69 E:0.087856 |  right across the face with his left foot in front of all the England players.
[2416.12 - 2420.32] P:1818.21 E:0.087656 |  You had Foden just really making his way into that six-yard box for a tap-in.
[2421.20 - 2427.00] P:1899.50 E:0.096358 |  0-0 on five-lie, first match between two of our home nations at a World Cup,
[2427.00 - 2430.40] P:1804.52 E:0.103824 |  not too much to get excited about so far, but...
[2430.40 - 2431.40] P:1754.99 E:0.115675 |  He's getting there, John.
[2431.40 - 2434.52] P:1901.44 E:0.090932 |  Yeah, better signs of promise in the last few minutes.
[2434.56 - 2437.92] P:1935.87 E:0.098034 |  Foden takes the corner in, it's headed to the edge of the area,
[2437.92 - 2441.56] P:1858.58 E:0.090228 |  and then Henderson lifts it over the top, Rashford's trying to get there,
[2441.56 - 2444.48] P:2035.88 E:0.104143 |  it bounces behind, it was off the head of Ben Davis,
[2444.48 - 2447.48] P:1973.54 E:0.097214 |  and it is a corner to England from the right-hand side.
[2447.48 - 2451.20] P:1869.22 E:0.106431 |  He's got to keep applying pressure, good quality delivery into the box,
[2451.20 - 2453.76] P:1905.69 E:0.113343 |  we need to make more of these set plays,
[2453.76 - 2458.28] P:1887.60 E:0.106221 |  he's been a major asset for England in the past, especially in Russia.
[2459.48 - 2463.88] P:1909.49 E:0.099506 |  We have the ability to be effective, Foden to take it from that far side,
[2463.88 - 2466.84] P:1951.12 E:0.101123 |  left-footed into the near post, and it's headed up and away,
[2466.84 - 2472.76] P:1938.54 E:0.080979 |  and back out towards that side by Duel Rodon, so it's out for a throw to England.
[2472.76 - 2478.16] P:1791.17 E:0.090050 |  In fact, in the last sort of five minutes or so, Wales have offered more in the game.
[2478.16 - 2482.56] P:1810.52 E:0.088858 |  And as a result of that, England have had the opportunity to counterattack,
[2482.56 - 2484.16] P:1717.13 E:0.098015 |  and that's made it a better game.
[2484.16 - 2489.24] P:1805.79 E:0.096509 |  Exactly, I think England might prefer if Wales do come out and have a bit more of the ball
[2489.24 - 2493.08] P:1881.23 E:0.073870 |  and push men forward as they have to.
[2493.16 - 2495.40] P:1815.29 E:0.106556 |  I think that's going to play into England's hands, to be honest,
[2495.40 - 2499.40] P:1905.42 E:0.086216 |  because the counterattack that we have can be really good.
[2499.40 - 2503.44] P:1994.53 E:0.094389 |  Let's not forget, Wales have to win this game.
[2503.44 - 2505.44] P:1891.27 E:0.096045 |  They had a standard chance of going through.
[2505.44 - 2507.88] P:1846.93 E:0.090391 |  They need the other match to be a draw, it's not.
[2507.88 - 2512.72] P:1830.19 E:0.100383 |  USA are winning, so at the moment England would finish top of the group
[2512.72 - 2515.28] P:1957.17 E:0.082834 |  in the United States in second.
[2517.36 - 2521.40] P:1965.38 E:0.097882 |  Halftime approach, Shaw for England.
[2521.40 - 2525.68] P:1874.88 E:0.091741 |  Back into his own half, Harry Maguire now passing 50 caps,
[2525.68 - 2529.80] P:1869.49 E:0.090391 |  he's 51st tonight across to John Stones, he's 62nd,
[2529.80 - 2534.12] P:1904.15 E:0.100039 |  and Stones just giving it back again to Harry Maguire.
[2534.12 - 2537.56] P:1868.26 E:0.103184 |  What we've got as well with Walker coming in, we've gone back for England
[2537.56 - 2541.16] P:1834.97 E:0.095076 |  to this half Manchester City, half Manchester United back four,
[2541.16 - 2544.48] P:1917.15 E:0.104545 |  Walker and Stones and Maguire and Shaw.
[2544.48 - 2547.64] P:1853.54 E:0.101238 |  I've also got Walker just coming inside the pitch as well,
[2547.68 - 2551.48] P:1902.68 E:0.103517 |  which is very Manchester City-like from that fall-back position
[2551.48 - 2554.48] P:1863.98 E:0.101513 |  to try and allow Phil Foden to get hold of the ball.
[2554.48 - 2559.32] P:1997.96 E:0.104993 |  Maguire, Thor, Thor down on the stretch a long pass,
[2559.32 - 2561.96] P:1829.03 E:0.105562 |  which was asking an awful lot of Phil Thor, and he went for it,
[2561.96 - 2565.00] P:1847.58 E:0.097198 |  saw it, but he got a foot to it and couldn't keep it in.
[2565.00 - 2567.36] P:1817.87 E:0.096917 |  He was always just drifting the wrong way, wasn't it?
[2567.36 - 2572.24] P:1816.61 E:0.089208 |  Nice idea from Harry Maguire, just to try and switch that play and stretch.
[2572.24 - 2575.00] P:1739.87 E:0.107821 |  Wales a little bit and Phil Foden just couldn't get there.
[2576.00 - 2578.00] P:1836.70 E:0.092212 |  What are you thinking, James Ludlow?
[2578.00 - 2582.00] P:1849.01 E:0.102911 |  I'm thinking the game's playing out as we probably would have thought.
[2582.00 - 2585.00] P:1709.34 E:0.092473 |  For Wales it's about getting through the first 45,
[2585.00 - 2589.00] P:1810.46 E:0.098730 |  trying to keep clean sheet, getting no-nil and throw everything at it.
[2589.00 - 2592.00] P:1853.50 E:0.077848 |  The second half, because Wales are going to have to change something,
[2592.00 - 2593.00] P:1707.04 E:0.074742 |  second half, on.
[2593.00 - 2596.00] P:1856.57 E:0.077183 |  Here's Kane in the centre-circle, but surrounded by Redshirts,
[2596.00 - 2599.00] P:1939.20 E:0.119398 |  he's been fouled by one of them, Redwold didn't quite land.
[2599.00 - 2602.00] P:1930.53 E:0.092465 |  Dan James, it was, he just ran into Kane, blocked him,
[2603.00 - 2606.00] P:1862.46 E:0.095689 |  so free kick to England. Juliet Farrington takes out.
[2606.00 - 2607.00] P:1897.91 E:0.075959 |  What can you see?
[2607.00 - 2611.00] P:1862.37 E:0.104660 |  Well, I can see that Wales look like they are going to make a substitution
[2611.00 - 2612.00] P:1788.84 E:0.106133 |  before half-time.
[2612.00 - 2615.00] P:1748.28 E:0.104262 |  I can see one of their players getting ready in the distance.
[2615.00 - 2618.00] P:1761.31 E:0.106369 |  They're obviously further away from me than the England benches,
[2618.00 - 2620.00] P:1691.89 E:0.094735 |  but look out for that one.
[2620.00 - 2623.00] P:1799.94 E:0.091039 |  And just to say on Nico Williams as well, that substitution,
[2623.00 - 2626.00] P:1936.02 E:0.094202 |  he came off, that was a concussion change,
[2626.00 - 2628.00] P:1846.35 E:0.091252 |  that substitution where Williams came off
[2628.00 - 2631.00] P:1881.45 E:0.102137 |  and he went straight down the tunnel with a member of the Wales medical team.
[2632.00 - 2634.00] P:1948.96 E:0.087186 |  Yep, so Wales would have that extra change.
[2634.00 - 2637.00] P:1870.23 E:0.113578 |  Rashford, now to the edge of the area, pulled it back, Shaw, race.
[2637.00 - 2641.00] P:1937.34 E:0.092711 |  He gives it to his left, Rashford in the box, lots of Redshirts to beat,
[2641.00 - 2644.00] P:1864.21 E:0.083939 |  plays it slightly behind both Bellingham and Shaw,
[2644.00 - 2646.00] P:1954.40 E:0.109107 |  but Bellingham has done well.
[2646.00 - 2648.00] P:2037.62 E:0.105356 |  And Roberts is able to put in the challenge for Wales
[2648.00 - 2650.00] P:2013.06 E:0.107325 |  to deflect it behind for Cornetto England.
[2650.00 - 2653.00] P:1933.51 E:0.098745 |  Yeah, tight area for England to have to operate in.
[2653.00 - 2655.00] P:1865.41 E:0.103974 |  It's quite good play just to get into the area,
[2655.00 - 2659.00] P:1788.53 E:0.103285 |  and all of a sudden there's that many Redshirts in and around the 18-yard box.
[2659.00 - 2663.00] P:1804.62 E:0.092264 |  The ball came out to Bellingham and he just tried to go around the outside
[2663.00 - 2666.00] P:1820.00 E:0.088573 |  and got muscled out of it in the end.
[2666.00 - 2670.00] P:1853.95 E:0.097348 |  Fodden with this corner for England, looking for McGuire,
[2670.00 - 2673.00] P:1835.51 E:0.081891 |  but they had three men around McGuire Wales,
[2673.00 - 2676.00] P:1861.93 E:0.089971 |  and it's headed away out to Garrafale who takes the ball down
[2676.00 - 2680.00] P:1930.16 E:0.096834 |  and gives it to Davis, and sweeps it forward with his left foot,
[2680.00 - 2683.00] P:1898.76 E:0.101232 |  and Bellingham was there on the halfway line for England.
[2683.00 - 2686.00] P:1845.87 E:0.097042 |  Now McGuire, who's still up there, he's halfway inside the Welsh Hark,
[2686.00 - 2691.00] P:1896.68 E:0.086813 |  he has Ampedu right with him, so it gives it to the right-hand side.
[2691.00 - 2696.00] P:1947.37 E:0.098907 |  Now England move it towards the left.
[2696.00 - 2699.00] P:1980.23 E:0.107865 |  Ramsay just warned us across in front of Stones,
[2699.00 - 2702.00] P:1923.56 E:0.104484 |  so Shaw spotted on the left-hand side,
[2702.00 - 2705.00] P:1865.07 E:0.099895 |  then back to the Stones again, long-raping pass,
[2705.00 - 2707.00] P:1904.77 E:0.110894 |  but straight through the middle end of the clubs,
[2707.00 - 2709.00] P:1971.18 E:0.109407 |  and they didn't do it.
[2709.00 - 2711.00] P:1938.01 E:0.101464 |  And five minutes about it's time.
[2711.00 - 2714.00] P:1710.70 E:0.101551 |  I'm looking at how deep Ampedu and Joe Alenard for Wales.
[2714.00 - 2718.00] P:1810.35 E:0.100708 |  They can't be further than five yards off the toes of the two centre-backs
[2718.00 - 2722.00] P:1724.67 E:0.083173 |  for most of the time, and I think that says a lot
[2722.00 - 2724.00] P:1759.91 E:0.093060 |  in terms of being able to play through.
[2724.00 - 2727.00] P:1780.98 E:0.096031 |  They don't want England to be able to play through the middle of the pitch,
[2727.00 - 2730.00] P:1922.11 E:0.095007 |  but they've had one chance through the middle, and that was on a turnover.
[2730.00 - 2733.00] P:1799.97 E:0.102434 |  So I don't think they're going to allow England to try and manoeuvre that ball,
[2733.00 - 2737.00] P:1899.23 E:0.092126 |  get a player like Bellingham in that area to turn on the ball
[2737.00 - 2741.00] P:1863.58 E:0.083800 |  and then find those passes, because they're just so deep in on top of each other
[2741.00 - 2743.00] P:1891.14 E:0.104536 |  that the space really has to go wide.
[2743.00 - 2747.00] P:1966.70 E:0.097610 |  Kane, very deep, gives it to Rashford, who tried to play it back to the far side,
[2747.00 - 2751.00] P:1897.95 E:0.108038 |  groans from the England supporters, as Kyle Walker is in there.
[2751.00 - 2757.00] P:1903.29 E:0.095800 |  Quite a heavy challenge actually in the middle of the field, in the centre-circle,
[2757.00 - 2761.00] P:1803.05 E:0.090987 |  on Dan James, but it's a free kick, and that's all it is.
[2761.00 - 2762.00] P:1760.86 E:0.109588 |  Just from behind, isn't it?
[2762.00 - 2764.00] P:1752.89 E:0.102482 |  It just kind of came from the side and behind their car walk.
[2764.00 - 2768.00] P:1931.12 E:0.077912 |  He's looked quite good though, looked quite physical in this game so far,
[2768.00 - 2771.00] P:1952.01 E:0.095401 |  enjoying the shoulder-to-shoulder challenges.
[2771.00 - 2775.00] P:1824.01 E:0.084052 |  So in that time at the end of the first half, Wales are coming forward.
[2775.00 - 2781.00] P:1868.32 E:0.076857 |  Wales, at some point, you know, have got to be positive about this.
[2781.00 - 2783.00] P:1868.64 E:0.098858 |  There's only one goal in the other match.
[2783.00 - 2785.00] P:1787.39 E:0.087156 |  In fact, let's get an update from Conor McNamara.
[2785.00 - 2787.00] P:1815.34 E:0.098696 |  Yes, we're in stoppages at the end of the first half.
[2787.00 - 2789.00] P:1671.98 E:0.102386 |  It is still 1-0 to the USA.
[2789.00 - 2792.00] P:1708.59 E:0.094050 |  The goal from Christian Pulisic, and the USA have been involved in two goals in the tournament.
[2792.00 - 2795.00] P:1681.38 E:0.099828 |  He scored one, he's assisted the other.
[2795.00 - 2797.00] P:1771.48 E:0.097991 |  Iran have not had a shot in this game so far.
[2797.00 - 2801.00] P:1779.55 E:0.095112 |  As you can imagine, John, the American fans are hooping and hollering,
[2801.00 - 2803.00] P:1829.10 E:0.103630 |  and they are very much enjoying what they're seeing here.
[2803.00 - 2806.00] P:1719.90 E:0.077372 |  Iran nil, USA won for now.
[2806.00 - 2808.00] P:1786.39 E:0.054417 |  Who'd have thought that?
[2808.00 - 2810.00] P:1751.96 E:0.098399 |  American fans hooping and hollering.
[2810.00 - 2814.00] P:1926.37 E:0.088829 |  Ward passing the ball out towards the far side,
[2814.00 - 2818.00] P:1812.31 E:0.101607 |  but Walker comes and wins the header, but straight at Joe Allen, who's able to take it down.
[2818.00 - 2821.00] P:1777.81 E:0.095946 |  Brennan Johnson, by the way, who is getting ready to come on.
[2821.00 - 2823.00] P:1883.68 E:0.107498 |  Oh, Joe Allen's giving it away.
[2823.00 - 2825.00] P:1862.66 E:0.089459 |  He's past it straight to Henderson, and now square to Kane.
[2825.00 - 2829.00] P:1896.50 E:0.101841 |  Kane, 25 yards out, slips it into the edge of the area to Bellingham.
[2829.00 - 2831.00] P:1894.44 E:0.101618 |  Now to Shaw on the left-hand side.
[2831.00 - 2833.00] P:1979.13 E:0.093860 |  Wales just able to clear.
[2833.00 - 2838.00] P:1928.72 E:0.108738 |  It was behind the pass, there's actually behind Meppam, who is able to get a touch.
[2838.00 - 2840.00] P:1927.90 E:0.096827 |  Back into the box though.
[2840.00 - 2842.00] P:1900.53 E:0.107178 |  Kane's going to try the shot, that's deflected.
[2842.00 - 2849.00] P:1940.55 E:0.104947 |  From maybe a couple of feet away from the strike of the England captain by Meppam,
[2849.00 - 2851.00] P:1930.24 E:0.111350 |  took it behind and wide of the goal.
[2851.00 - 2852.00] P:1856.19 E:0.119554 |  Corner again to England.
[2852.00 - 2857.00] P:1898.59 E:0.106792 |  On the previous charge, John, I counted seven red Wales shirts in the penalty area
[2857.00 - 2859.00] P:1843.50 E:0.099156 |  when England had that ball there.
[2859.00 - 2863.00] P:1922.65 E:0.092921 |  And I just think there's so many bodies that they've just got to keep chipping away England,
[2863.00 - 2867.00] P:1832.49 E:0.096365 |  getting in good areas, maybe having shots from in and around the edge of the box,
[2867.00 - 2870.00] P:1782.70 E:0.091442 |  like Harry Cainty there, because for a goalkeeper,
[2870.00 - 2872.00] P:1834.61 E:0.104737 |  any kind of effort on the edge of the box through all those bodies,
[2872.00 - 2875.00] P:1816.50 E:0.091527 |  it's going to be difficult if the ball just deflects the pass shoot.
[2875.00 - 2878.00] P:1874.05 E:0.084175 |  Folding then with this latest England corner.
[2878.00 - 2880.00] P:1831.43 E:0.077143 |  Again, it's to the back post.
[2880.00 - 2887.00] P:2000.10 E:0.098194 |  Headed back across underneath the crossbar, but caught quite comfortably by Danny Ward.
[2887.00 - 2891.00] P:1906.05 E:0.090093 |  Backpedaling, it was John Stones who got the header on the far side of the six yard box.
[2891.00 - 2897.00] P:1813.64 E:0.086173 |  And another Welshman has gone down on his knees near the corner of the penalty area.
[2897.00 - 2898.00] P:1879.47 E:0.093866 |  Might be Ampedu.
[2898.00 - 2899.00] P:1542.91 E:0.104833 |  Yes, Ampedu.
[2899.00 - 2905.00] P:1948.53 E:0.103888 |  Yeah, so just a little stoppage there and the referee's gone across.
[2905.00 - 2909.00] P:2012.73 E:0.091986 |  So in added time at the end of the first half, Jane Ludlow.
[2909.00 - 2913.00] P:1909.08 E:0.105716 |  Well, it's been a pretty uninspiring first half of football, isn't it?
[2913.00 - 2917.00] P:1789.21 E:0.080556 |  But I think Wales would be relatively happy if this ends,
[2917.00 - 2920.00] P:1601.75 E:0.099366 |  and they'll know first 45 minutes, they'll be relatively happy walking inside.
[2920.00 - 2923.00] P:1653.27 E:0.092455 |  And do expect changes when they come out second half,
[2923.00 - 2926.00] P:1642.81 E:0.093031 |  because you know, everybody knows Wales have to get a result from this today.
[2926.00 - 2933.00] P:1771.13 E:0.092747 |  Now, whether that's younger, fresher legs to come on and try and exploit the space behind England,
[2933.00 - 2934.00] P:1872.69 E:0.071645 |  who knows.
[2934.00 - 2937.00] P:1577.34 E:0.097915 |  But right now, look, the one thing Wales are doing well is getting bodies in the box
[2937.00 - 2939.00] P:1874.42 E:0.067172 |  and defending for the likes.
[2939.00 - 2941.00] P:1984.31 E:0.083141 |  That's what they're doing.
[2941.00 - 2945.00] P:1944.21 E:0.104953 |  And they're coming forward, actually, and the latter stage is here at the first half, Ramsey.
[2945.00 - 2948.00] P:1861.77 E:0.088546 |  And the throw-in is won off Rashford.
[2948.00 - 2951.00] P:1831.92 E:0.086495 |  Conor Roberts, for some reason, pushed Rashford in the chest.
[2951.00 - 2955.00] P:1943.20 E:0.101051 |  So I think Rashford was trying to stop him getting to the ball to take a quick throw.
[2955.00 - 2958.00] P:1840.83 E:0.099788 |  And that must be something that the referees have been told about.
[2958.00 - 2962.00] P:1884.98 E:0.093041 |  That's what I'd take from that, because the referee was all over that.
[2962.00 - 2965.00] P:1886.52 E:0.083376 |  And has come across and told them both off.
[2965.00 - 2969.00] P:1868.14 E:0.087770 |  Throw-in, Roberts to take it. Conor Roberts backs up against the hoardings,
[2969.00 - 2971.00] P:1785.41 E:0.085174 |  down on this side of the ground.
[2971.00 - 2974.00] P:1944.86 E:0.086261 |  There's a Cameron, virtually following it.
[2974.00 - 2978.00] P:1918.64 E:0.095482 |  Roberts comes up, takes the throw, he actually angles it back towards the...
[2978.00 - 2981.00] P:1886.49 E:0.110747 |  And now, Jo-Avins into the area and shoots!
[2981.00 - 2983.00] P:1912.89 E:0.107355 |  Left footed, but that flies away.
[2983.00 - 2985.00] P:2019.38 E:0.105183 |  Right of the England goal.
[2985.00 - 2990.00] P:2024.43 E:0.102728 |  Pickford diving to his right, but he's quite comfortable that it was not on target.
[2990.00 - 2993.00] P:1901.90 E:0.105907 |  That's just about the best moment that Wales have had.
[2993.00 - 2995.00] P:1886.74 E:0.085021 |  Nice throw-in play.
[2995.00 - 2999.00] P:1821.13 E:0.085792 |  Nicely worked. That's thought out and premeditated, I think.
[2999.00 - 3004.00] P:1876.16 E:0.080715 |  The throw-in goes backwards. Jo-Avins just drifts into that little hole.
[3004.00 - 3008.00] P:1995.36 E:0.105567 |  And the ball pops into him and he gets a shot off. It's a nice throw-in.
[3008.00 - 3013.00] P:1970.72 E:0.109932 |  And there's the halftime whistle, just having a listen to see if there's any reaction from the supporters.
[3013.00 - 3016.00] P:1949.05 E:0.108594 |  There's actually loud applause from the Wales fans down there.
[3016.00 - 3018.00] P:1980.07 E:0.098924 |  The England fans left sole.
[3018.00 - 3021.00] P:1873.74 E:0.106763 |  What an odd campaign it's been for England so far.
[3021.00 - 3027.00] P:1821.32 E:0.092713 |  6-2 in the first match, starting a match like no other England team has ever done before
[3027.00 - 3030.00] P:1823.23 E:0.087895 |  by scoring six goals in their opening game.
[3030.00 - 3036.00] P:1728.83 E:0.089395 |  Then nil-nil against the United States, and now nil-nil in the first half against Wales.
[3036.00 - 3044.00] P:1869.26 E:0.092928 |  I think what says it all is, I've just spent 10, 15 seconds describing how good the throwing was from Wales.
[3044.00 - 3050.00] P:1744.76 E:0.097442 |  And that to me says what this 45 minutes has brought, to be honest.
[3050.00 - 3054.00] P:1606.59 E:0.085461 |  It's not been great. We've expected more from England.
[3054.00 - 3059.00] P:1692.37 E:0.094829 |  I think Wales can go in at halftime feeling like it's kind of the mission that they had.
[3059.00 - 3063.00] P:1597.71 E:0.093221 |  And they're halfway along. They haven't conceded. They're still in the game.
[3063.00 - 3067.00] P:1537.42 E:0.089970 |  Got an opportunity to win it. And England need to snub that out.
[3067.00 - 3073.00] P:1611.72 E:0.095146 |  And they need to stamp their authority on this game and start putting something together to be more authoritative,
[3073.00 - 3078.00] P:1722.95 E:0.093133 |  more attacking-minded in creating chances.
[3078.00 - 3081.00] P:1663.33 E:0.094581 |  And maybe as the game goes on, those moments will open up.
[3081.00 - 3085.00] P:1715.65 E:0.086064 |  But Jane Ludlow, thing is, Wales have got to win this game.
[3085.00 - 3089.00] P:1711.61 E:0.091852 |  So at some point, they've got to throw caution to the wind, yeah?
[3089.00 - 3093.00] P:1640.92 E:0.093160 |  Yeah, and touching on what you've just said, the game will open up, won't it?
[3093.00 - 3097.00] P:1630.46 E:0.095751 |  When Wales start doing that and throwing more players forwards and attacking a little bit more
[3097.00 - 3100.00] P:1580.97 E:0.090926 |  and hopefully exploiting some space behind the back line for England,
[3100.00 - 3104.00] P:1673.12 E:0.097709 |  then those gaps are going to open up. And what we've seen in the first 45 minutes
[3104.00 - 3108.00] P:1759.96 E:0.100649 |  is some of the England opportunities have come from those turnovers and transitions.
[3108.00 - 3114.00] P:1777.16 E:0.084084 |  So it should be a more inspiring second 45 minutes because it's all still to play for.
[3114.00 - 3118.00] P:1919.70 E:0.079768 |  So it is Wales-nil, England-nil.
[3118.00 - 3120.00] P:1933.06 E:0.098610 |  Good throw, Meryteen, wasn't it?
[3120.00 - 3123.00] P:1825.33 E:0.077549 |  Brilliant throw, Ian. Did you enjoy it?
[3123.00 - 3127.00] P:1650.24 E:0.098121 |  Yeah, I'm genuinely kind of about how to ask you at the moment.
[3127.00 - 3133.00] P:1694.54 E:0.092775 |  I mean, we can keep eulogising about that.
[3133.00 - 3138.00] P:1544.77 E:0.079648 |  I know. Well, it's not good, is it, that we're talking about that.
[3138.00 - 3141.00] P:1822.45 E:0.083641 |  But there isn't that many other moments.
[3141.00 - 3144.00] P:1704.30 E:0.092120 |  Should we take into account the fact that Wales have sat there?
[3144.00 - 3147.00] P:1538.11 E:0.101211 |  I think that's something that you need to look at and go,
[3147.00 - 3151.00] P:1773.63 E:0.081890 |  well, perhaps that is a reason. If it opens up, second half will have another look.
[3151.00 - 3154.00] P:1849.55 E:0.096097 |  We'll talk more about this game in a moment.
[3154.00 - 3159.00] P:1760.44 E:0.094956 |  The better game of the two tonight without a shadow of a doubt is Iran against USA.
[3159.00 - 3162.00] P:1851.48 E:0.088272 |  Plenty of chances for USA.
[3162.00 - 3165.00] P:1787.50 E:0.102238 |  They've just had a second ruled out for offside, Conor McEvoy.
[3165.00 - 3168.00] P:1700.44 E:0.106465 |  Yeah, we've only seen one replay, but it looks very tight, Mark.
[3168.00 - 3171.00] P:1863.07 E:0.099882 |  But the second goal has not been allowed to stand
[3171.00 - 3175.00] P:1787.64 E:0.100497 |  and it's the Christian Pulisic effort that has got the USA in front here tonight.
[3175.00 - 3178.00] P:1751.57 E:0.107756 |  That they have to win a draw could be enough for Iran.
[3178.00 - 3183.00] P:1790.52 E:0.095494 |  But really, it's a game in which the USA have dominated in possession in terms of territory.
[3183.00 - 3186.00] P:1722.66 E:0.097894 |  There's only been one breakaway counterattack from the Iranians
[3186.00 - 3189.00] P:1590.23 E:0.104427 |  and they messed it up. Two attackers over the penalty area.
[3189.00 - 3192.00] P:1576.96 E:0.097393 |  Taremi tried to lay it back to Osmoon.
[3192.00 - 3195.00] P:1721.00 E:0.102301 |  Probably should have taken it on himself. USA were able to give away.
[3195.00 - 3199.00] P:1807.71 E:0.104340 |  There was another chance as well for the United States when they were three on two
[3199.00 - 3202.00] P:1719.86 E:0.093810 |  and between them, Weyer and Sargent messed it up.
[3202.00 - 3206.00] P:1790.80 E:0.100516 |  Now we're getting to see that computer generated image of where they show the offside
[3206.00 - 3209.00] P:1788.83 E:0.094735 |  and Weyer's just stepped in the wrong side of the defender.
[3209.00 - 3214.00] P:1752.14 E:0.098278 |  Correct decision. The second goal doesn't stand and it's Iran-nil, USA-one
[3214.00 - 3216.00] P:1723.38 E:0.090904 |  at the moment, England and USA going through.
[3216.00 - 3220.00] P:1767.80 E:0.093950 |  They've continued, haven't they, Conor, with how they played against England, the USA?
[3220.00 - 3222.00] P:1704.63 E:0.099796 |  Taremi just with the energy and the intensity.
[3222.00 - 3225.00] P:1581.60 E:0.101801 |  Yeah, and I'd even add to that, you know, and still the lack of a proper number nine.
[3225.00 - 3228.00] P:1809.06 E:0.097977 |  You know, you feel that the amount of getting it out to white positions,
[3228.00 - 3230.00] P:1567.97 E:0.090102 |  Dest has been excellent.
[3230.00 - 3234.00] P:1556.02 E:0.097167 |  Robinson on the left-hand side delivery, but they don't have anyone in the middle to finish off.
[3234.00 - 3236.00] P:1877.57 E:0.109083 |  Pulisic was really brave when he scored.
[3236.00 - 3240.00] P:1708.91 E:0.097160 |  He clattered into the goalkeeper here to leave their field to receive treatment,
[3240.00 - 3242.00] P:1665.17 E:0.094169 |  but he did come back on again.
[3242.00 - 3246.00] P:1619.04 E:0.081643 |  But you think if USA had a proper number nine, they'd be some team.
[3246.00 - 3250.00] P:1753.78 E:0.093662 |  Conor, thank you very much. By the way, that game is on BBC Two,
[3250.00 - 3255.00] P:1803.03 E:0.092385 |  if you want to watch USA against Iran, Wales, England on BBC Two.
[3255.00 - 3258.00] P:1831.55 E:0.068419 |  What? Why are you pointing at me?
[3258.00 - 3262.00] P:1822.04 E:0.093909 |  Because that was absolutely... I don't blame you.
[3262.00 - 3265.00] P:1837.10 E:0.108929 |  What for telling people to go watch BBC Two?
[3265.00 - 3267.00] P:1698.78 E:0.085453 |  Basically, turn over.
[3267.00 - 3269.00] P:1871.35 E:0.080579 |  Because that was painful.
[3269.00 - 3273.00] P:1738.84 E:0.081284 |  That was, I mean, the happiest man in the world in myself.
[3273.00 - 3276.00] P:1796.09 E:0.075444 |  Can't even pick positives out of that game.
[3276.00 - 3284.00] P:1814.12 E:0.081033 |  What about Matt's point of how much you judge it by Wales hitting it?
[3284.00 - 3287.00] P:1753.94 E:0.108052 |  Yeah, I think we knew Wales were going to do that.
[3287.00 - 3290.00] P:1845.22 E:0.091515 |  They were going to try to keep it tight first half,
[3290.00 - 3293.00] P:1865.87 E:0.095945 |  and then second half they're going to have to take more risks.
[3293.00 - 3295.00] P:1951.40 E:0.095620 |  That is exactly what happened against USA.
[3295.00 - 3298.00] P:1956.92 E:0.097263 |  It was a low block at times for them,
[3298.00 - 3301.00] P:1841.79 E:0.096176 |  and England just moving the ball too slow.
[3301.00 - 3304.00] P:1786.43 E:0.088640 |  When they get in the offensive third, it needs to be sharp,
[3304.00 - 3308.00] P:1724.01 E:0.095408 |  and every time they have moved the ball quickly, they've got the two chances.
[3308.00 - 3310.00] P:1847.76 E:0.074341 |  I absolutely agree with that.
[3310.00 - 3316.00] P:1584.49 E:0.089168 |  I cannot bear when teams sit off and players still don't move the ball with intensity.
[3316.00 - 3319.00] P:1637.80 E:0.099582 |  That isn't a licence to just go slow and stand on the ball.
[3319.00 - 3321.00] P:1810.06 E:0.091521 |  For me, you've got to move it quicker.
[3321.00 - 3323.00] P:1658.35 E:0.093379 |  Because making that pass and even getting it back,
[3323.00 - 3325.00] P:1844.51 E:0.092050 |  the picture then changes a little bit in front of you.
[3325.00 - 3327.00] P:1827.33 E:0.101103 |  It might just be a small change,
[3327.00 - 3329.00] P:1803.67 E:0.103972 |  but it might be enough to then find that ball-threaded through
[3329.00 - 3331.00] P:1854.02 E:0.091484 |  or a bit of space over the top.
[3331.00 - 3333.00] P:1926.72 E:0.092374 |  Yeah, and that's exactly why.
[3333.00 - 3336.00] P:1766.32 E:0.092469 |  When you've got the Rice and Henderson,
[3336.00 - 3338.00] P:1735.86 E:0.114569 |  I think we need a Rice or a Henderson.
[3338.00 - 3340.00] P:1830.02 E:0.082529 |  I don't think we need both of them.
[3340.00 - 3343.00] P:1735.33 E:0.094712 |  I would have the Folden more in the middle
[3343.00 - 3345.00] P:1779.39 E:0.092774 |  and have a Sacka on the right-hand side
[3345.00 - 3347.00] P:1838.92 E:0.103708 |  because then you've got Bellinom making the runs.
[3347.00 - 3349.00] P:1961.69 E:0.097588 |  You've got Folden getting that little pocket of space,
[3349.00 - 3351.00] P:1930.81 E:0.109089 |  and they've got Rice showing it up.
[3351.00 - 3353.00] P:1891.68 E:0.082901 |  Does Bellinom look as effective to you
[3353.00 - 3357.00] P:1729.06 E:0.102734 |  when he's receiving that ball with his back to play with players all around him?
[3357.00 - 3359.00] P:1613.07 E:0.099785 |  For me, that isn't where I want to see it.
[3359.00 - 3363.00] P:1794.71 E:0.077884 |  I'd rather see Phil Folden do that than Jude Bellinom, to be honest.
[3363.00 - 3365.00] P:1900.90 E:0.086039 |  Is that for you then, Matt?
[3365.00 - 3368.00] P:1864.24 E:0.097540 |  Is that the midfield area that is predominantly responsible
[3368.00 - 3370.00] P:1956.78 E:0.090163 |  for how quickly that ball has moved along?
[3370.00 - 3373.00] P:1813.76 E:0.087976 |  No, I think it's a massive responsibility in the centre-backs, to be honest.
[3373.00 - 3375.00] P:1488.63 E:0.101700 |  And the full-back starts there.
[3375.00 - 3377.00] P:1716.12 E:0.097163 |  It's how quickly you want to move that ball.
[3377.00 - 3380.00] P:1838.97 E:0.098060 |  If there's no pressure, you still fire that ball out with intensity.
[3380.00 - 3382.00] P:1846.03 E:0.093871 |  One or two touches.
[3382.00 - 3383.00] P:1819.41 E:0.100037 |  Move it quick.
[3383.00 - 3385.00] P:1923.19 E:0.088694 |  And as you're moving that ball side to side,
[3385.00 - 3387.00] P:1842.57 E:0.096606 |  the team has to move along with you.
[3387.00 - 3389.00] P:1729.83 E:0.102434 |  Wales have to shuffle, and all of a sudden,
[3389.00 - 3392.00] P:1768.04 E:0.089766 |  you might see that little hole open up, but it's got to be moved quicker.
[3392.00 - 3396.00] P:1772.92 E:0.087926 |  The centre-backs always control the tempo of the game
[3396.00 - 3398.00] P:1822.62 E:0.086125 |  when you've got possession.
[3398.00 - 3401.00] P:1699.73 E:0.093669 |  When a team sits really deep like that, you've got to step out.
[3401.00 - 3403.00] P:1924.16 E:0.097078 |  McGuire did it on a couple occasions.
[3403.00 - 3406.00] P:1683.24 E:0.096406 |  And apart from the Bug Cross, it worked.
[3406.00 - 3409.00] P:1794.77 E:0.105706 |  If you set the tempo slow from the back,
[3409.00 - 3411.00] P:1782.67 E:0.103402 |  and the rest of the team is slow as well,
[3411.00 - 3414.00] P:1759.01 E:0.097634 |  we need to move the ball quicker and get into the mid-areas
[3414.00 - 3416.00] P:1758.81 E:0.087115 |  and try to hurt Wales.
[3416.00 - 3421.00] P:1816.25 E:0.093246 |  Well, the half-time entertainment is just about to start here.
[3421.00 - 3423.00] P:1863.40 E:0.096434 |  And we had a little chat earlier.
[3423.00 - 3426.00] P:1885.72 E:0.100961 |  This man was on five-life breakfast this morning as well.
[3426.00 - 3429.00] P:1914.30 E:0.081864 |  And one member of the team went and told that
[3429.00 - 3433.00] P:1872.55 E:0.095200 |  Chesley Hawkes was providing the half-time entertainment.
[3433.00 - 3435.00] P:1754.62 E:0.063824 |  Said who?
[3435.00 - 3438.00] P:1642.35 E:0.074081 |  Now, you were...
[3438.00 - 3443.00] P:1462.21 E:0.107743 |  This was number one in 1991, I think, so you were three years old.
[3443.00 - 3444.00] P:1412.37 E:0.098812 |  Three.
[3444.00 - 3445.00] P:1660.25 E:0.066287 |  I gasped.
[3445.00 - 3447.00] P:1332.14 E:0.111838 |  Chappers, when he didn't know who.
[3447.00 - 3450.00] P:1505.91 E:0.107077 |  Oh, I thought you meant you gassed at the excitement of Chesley Hawkes
[3450.00 - 3452.00] P:1533.13 E:0.108616 |  in the half-time shows.
[3452.00 - 3454.00] P:1495.51 E:0.114434 |  Well, that balances up.
[3454.00 - 3456.00] P:1597.04 E:0.098784 |  Mike had not done it.
[3456.00 - 3460.00] P:1490.36 E:0.096386 |  Now, when you hear it, Mike, and now, is it familiar?
[3460.00 - 3463.00] P:1577.34 E:0.103614 |  I've never heard this song before in my life, Chappers.
[3463.00 - 3468.00] P:1447.33 E:0.108145 |  Well, John Murray said to me he was really keen to sing along with the chorus, so...
[3468.00 - 3472.00] P:1393.52 E:0.128270 |  Oh, no, I hit that perfectly for you.
[3472.00 - 3474.00] P:1546.10 E:0.110269 |  I hit it perfectly for you.
[3474.00 - 3476.00] P:1545.37 E:0.100832 |  Well, once a radio, one DJ.
[3476.00 - 3478.00] P:1547.16 E:0.100439 |  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[3482.00 - 3485.00] P:1465.46 E:0.128473 |  Biker, you've heard of Big Crosby.
[3485.00 - 3486.00] P:1365.61 E:0.101293 |  Who?
[3486.00 - 3488.00] P:1288.30 E:0.117979 |  Big Crosby!
[3488.00 - 3492.00] P:1408.41 E:0.098948 |  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[3492.00 - 3495.00] P:1626.33 E:0.097663 |  Well, and there's the difference in our eras, John.
[3495.00 - 3498.00] P:1799.16 E:0.101956 |  I go Chesley Hawkes, you go Big Crosby.
[3498.00 - 3499.00] P:1609.70 E:0.108712 |  There we are.
[3499.00 - 3502.00] P:1836.98 E:0.085603 |  My point is, you know white Christmas, obviously.
[3502.00 - 3504.00] P:1605.02 E:0.096139 |  You know white Christmas.
[3504.00 - 3506.00] P:1767.30 E:0.093268 |  Jane, do you wish you were here?
[3506.00 - 3509.00] P:1590.98 E:0.105444 |  To be honest, guys, I was hoping you'd stop talking so I could listen.
[3509.00 - 3511.00] P:1661.34 E:0.113347 |  This is a tune.
[3511.00 - 3513.00] P:1876.47 E:0.071501 |  This is my era.
[3513.00 - 3514.00] P:1808.76 E:0.110777 |  My era, too.
[3514.00 - 3518.00] P:1677.45 E:0.101839 |  It's very disappointing that Micah doesn't know who he is.
[3518.00 - 3521.00] P:1792.02 E:0.104133 |  And what was great on five live breakfast this morning?
[3521.00 - 3525.00] P:1831.76 E:0.102582 |  Chesley Hawkes said, he said to Rick, he's doing the half-time entertainment.
[3525.00 - 3527.00] P:1876.31 E:0.100542 |  He's only doing one song.
[3527.00 - 3531.00] P:1795.42 E:0.099439 |  And Rick said, so which one are you doing?
[3531.00 - 3535.00] P:1867.15 E:0.087004 |  Right, he only had one big hit, basically, Micah.
[3535.00 - 3537.00] P:1933.06 E:0.084820 |  That's the big one.
[3537.00 - 3538.00] P:1844.03 E:0.107325 |  Micah already knew.
[3538.00 - 3539.00] P:1783.11 E:0.091175 |  Oh, right, okay, right.
[3539.00 - 3540.00] P:1773.47 E:0.121512 |  I've been informed that.
[3540.00 - 3543.00] P:1859.78 E:0.089261 |  Thank God for Chesley Hawkes, because he filled two or three minutes
[3543.00 - 3546.00] P:1832.30 E:0.100811 |  when I couldn't have been able to talk about it with the football.
[3546.00 - 3548.00] P:1839.41 E:0.098438 |  Second half on the way, goal is here.
[3548.00 - 3552.00] P:1775.61 E:0.100611 |  USA leader, Ranby, Goulton Hill, England and the USA,
[3552.00 - 3555.00] P:1659.15 E:0.095690 |  qualifying as things stand.
[3555.00 - 3560.00] P:1688.06 E:0.084805 |  As Chesley rocks it down there, let's just pause for the latest BBC News.
[3560.00 - 3565.00] P:1463.82 E:0.123934 |  Take the World Cup with you at our 2022 on BBC Sounds.
[3565.00 - 3568.00] P:1510.09 E:0.118729 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3568.00 - 3570.00] P:1395.59 E:0.105376 |  With the BBC News, I'm Jill McKenzie.
[3570.00 - 3574.00] P:1692.86 E:0.087214 |  The UK Health Security Agency says around 20 people could have died
[3574.00 - 3578.00] P:1487.23 E:0.095627 |  because of a mistake in a COVID lab that led to 39,000 positive tests
[3578.00 - 3580.00] P:1567.56 E:0.083184 |  being reported as negative.
[3580.00 - 3585.00] P:1663.64 E:0.081744 |  Experts estimate that the error led to an extra 55,000 infections last year.
[3585.00 - 3588.00] P:1693.84 E:0.078966 |  A man's due at Westminster Magistrates Court tomorrow
[3588.00 - 3591.00] P:1581.61 E:0.093232 |  after being arrested in connection with the deaths of at least 27 people
[3591.00 - 3594.00] P:1651.92 E:0.090922 |  who drowned trying to cross the English Channel last year.
[3594.00 - 3597.00] P:1782.14 E:0.082591 |  The 32-year-old could be extradited to France,
[3597.00 - 3599.00] P:1647.12 E:0.062860 |  where he faces manslaughter charges.
[3599.00 - 3602.00] P:1651.22 E:0.090706 |  The Royal College of Nursing says up to 100,000 nurses
[3602.00 - 3604.00] P:1078.92 E:0.108382 |  will strike in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
[3604.00 - 3607.00] P:1679.23 E:0.077775 |  on the 15th and 20th of December.
[3607.00 - 3611.00] P:1389.18 E:0.091776 |  Action has been suspended in Scotland after the government made a higher pay offer.
[3611.00 - 3615.00] P:1555.13 E:0.090872 |  And for the first time ever, less than half of the population of England and Wales
[3615.00 - 3617.00] P:1640.64 E:0.079016 |  say they identify as Christian.
[3617.00 - 3623.00] P:1433.12 E:0.079086 |  It's now 46% down from almost 60% in the last census 10 years ago.
[3633.00 - 3635.00] P:1441.39 E:0.108714 |  And this is How We Hustle.
[3635.00 - 3638.00] P:1034.28 E:0.140075 |  I was going maybe 90%, but that 10% can change your life.
[3638.00 - 3641.00] P:1217.72 E:0.127550 |  It's one big game and I just want to get the best score and the best win.
[3641.00 - 3645.00] P:1281.03 E:0.123947 |  This is the podcast where the best in the business talk to us about their hustle.
[3645.00 - 3649.00] P:1309.24 E:0.130245 |  I understand where I want to go. I appreciate what I've done and where I've been.
[3649.00 - 3653.00] P:1494.85 E:0.122076 |  Obviously everything happens for a reason in it, but I feel like I'll be so missing, it'll be ridiculous.
[3653.00 - 3657.00] P:1510.77 E:0.117364 |  The Hustle continues with season two of How We Hustle with me, Yanny.
[3657.00 - 3659.00] P:1610.83 E:0.099264 |  Whatever I wanted to do, I'd do it.
[3659.00 - 3661.00] P:1581.44 E:0.087392 |  Listen first on BBC Sounds.
[3661.00 - 3663.00] P:1220.93 E:0.106391 |  BBC Five Live.
[3663.00 - 3665.00] P:1023.12 E:0.126360 |  The FIFA World Cup.
[3665.00 - 3669.00] P:1376.27 E:0.113710 |  Qatar 2022 with Mark Chapman.
[3669.00 - 3671.00] P:1915.80 E:0.092656 |  Fair play to Jesse Hawks. He's just finished.
[3671.00 - 3675.00] P:1830.91 E:0.100501 |  He went acapella for a while to try and get the crowd singing along, but...
[3675.00 - 3679.00] P:1859.88 E:0.092960 |  I'll be honest, there's not much enthusiasm in this stadium.
[3679.00 - 3681.00] P:1766.90 E:0.105478 |  I think that might have something to do with the first half.
[3681.00 - 3686.00] P:1962.47 E:0.096416 |  Jules, you were singing along. You're pitch-eyed. You had a great view.
[3686.00 - 3688.00] P:1855.71 E:0.098045 |  Sorry, I was just about to have a crisp.
[3688.00 - 3690.00] P:1890.79 E:0.110609 |  Yes, I was singing along there.
[3690.00 - 3693.00] P:1967.47 E:0.104686 |  It was interesting because he's changed his shirt.
[3693.00 - 3698.00] P:1886.59 E:0.090962 |  He's got a glitter guitar strap and he's an absolute big fan of Declan Rice.
[3698.00 - 3701.00] P:1899.60 E:0.102113 |  He had an England shirt on earlier, and he was sitting in the England dugout.
[3701.00 - 3706.00] P:1935.53 E:0.100670 |  He said, do you think it'll be on the BBC at half-time?
[3706.00 - 3709.00] P:1929.22 E:0.095026 |  I said, well, I'm sure it'll be on the radio.
[3709.00 - 3713.00] P:1857.15 E:0.094668 |  But then, as he was coming out to perform that,
[3713.00 - 3715.00] P:1740.81 E:0.086400 |  Callum Wilson was one of the substitutes.
[3715.00 - 3718.00] P:1834.29 E:0.089964 |  He was on the pitch and he gave him the big thumbs up.
[3718.00 - 3723.00] P:1806.58 E:0.094367 |  But I really think he was hoping that Declan Rice would come to him.
[3723.00 - 3727.00] P:1812.85 E:0.094915 |  When the players were coming out to do their warm-ups before the match,
[3727.00 - 3729.00] P:1844.79 E:0.101122 |  he was hanging around that area.
[3729.00 - 3732.00] P:1803.92 E:0.089575 |  I think he absolutely rinsed the video on his phone.
[3732.00 - 3734.00] P:1515.88 E:0.099264 |  He was so excited.
[3734.00 - 3737.00] P:1623.97 E:0.091267 |  As I was walking past to him, before that moment,
[3737.00 - 3740.00] P:1622.19 E:0.093848 |  he was saying, this is the closest I'm going to get to Declan Rice
[3740.00 - 3743.00] P:1740.54 E:0.091022 |  wearing an England shirt with Declan Rice on the back.
[3743.00 - 3746.00] P:1723.21 E:0.095087 |  He was hoping at full-time, dependent on the result,
[3746.00 - 3748.00] P:1689.98 E:0.086716 |  dependent on the move that Declan Rice is in.
[3748.00 - 3750.00] P:1647.88 E:0.090460 |  But he might just go over and have a selfie with him.
[3750.00 - 3753.00] P:1719.89 E:0.093172 |  Absolutely. Good stuff, Chesley Hawks.
[3753.00 - 3755.00] P:1822.18 E:0.080383 |  The half-time entertainment here.
[3755.00 - 3757.00] P:1791.25 E:0.092973 |  Goalless between Wales and England.
[3757.00 - 3759.00] P:1709.29 E:0.089914 |  USA leader, Ran by Goldsdale.
[3759.00 - 3761.00] P:1914.34 E:0.097179 |  So England would top the group. USA would be second.
[3761.00 - 3764.00] P:1843.94 E:0.094509 |  England would be playing Senegal in the last 16.
[3764.00 - 3768.00] P:1913.92 E:0.084046 |  The USA would be playing the Netherlands as they stand.
[3768.00 - 3772.00] P:1954.79 E:0.085544 |  Michael Richards, Matt Upsson, Jane Ludlow, all with us.
[3772.00 - 3776.00] P:1980.22 E:0.083587 |  And for how long do you go more of the same, then, Jane,
[3776.00 - 3778.00] P:1907.84 E:0.074639 |  if you're Rob Page?
[3778.00 - 3781.00] P:1820.75 E:0.082544 |  Oh, that's an interesting question.
[3781.00 - 3783.00] P:1679.96 E:0.092411 |  Look, we've got to go for it, haven't we?
[3783.00 - 3785.00] P:1778.50 E:0.088140 |  But when?
[3785.00 - 3788.00] P:1812.93 E:0.079007 |  For me, it'd be from straight off, second half.
[3788.00 - 3792.00] P:1781.86 E:0.086168 |  Let's get out there and let's just throw it in England
[3792.00 - 3793.00] P:1736.82 E:0.084636 |  and see what we get.
[3793.00 - 3795.00] P:1890.95 E:0.083494 |  Because reality check, now,
[3795.00 - 3797.00] P:1753.18 E:0.087132 |  we have to throw everything we can at this game.
[3797.00 - 3801.00] P:1717.07 E:0.086149 |  Wales can't afford to wait until the last 10 minutes, 20 minutes
[3801.00 - 3803.00] P:1858.73 E:0.062843 |  to try and change this match.
[3803.00 - 3805.00] P:1822.08 E:0.093630 |  Rob Page could make that decision,
[3805.00 - 3807.00] P:1792.50 E:0.064740 |  but I'd be surprised if he does.
[3807.00 - 3810.00] P:1849.68 E:0.087518 |  The other side of that, Michael, is, of course,
[3810.00 - 3813.00] P:1851.56 E:0.087414 |  as soon as Wales did get up the other end
[3813.00 - 3816.00] P:1818.56 E:0.087982 |  and create either one chance or a half chance,
[3816.00 - 3819.00] P:1857.37 E:0.076735 |  they were vulnerable to the break, weren't they?
[3819.00 - 3820.00] P:1854.48 E:0.060353 |  Yeah, exactly.
[3820.00 - 3824.00] P:1844.22 E:0.080810 |  I think they're going to have to open up at some stage.
[3824.00 - 3828.00] P:1846.49 E:0.079173 |  I think it's just that transition came again.
[3828.00 - 3830.00] P:1879.14 E:0.099581 |  It's coming a little bit too deep.
[3830.00 - 3832.00] P:1751.04 E:0.093721 |  But like we said before the game,
[3832.00 - 3834.00] P:1745.31 E:0.104380 |  when you've got the winning ones like Rashford,
[3834.00 - 3836.00] P:1892.27 E:0.097747 |  they've got into the opportunity,
[3836.00 - 3839.00] P:1953.02 E:0.087246 |  that is what they want to do, exploit them spaces.
[3839.00 - 3842.00] P:1851.48 E:0.097306 |  But I want to see a lot more for England in the second half.
[3842.00 - 3846.00] P:1724.90 E:0.102488 |  And also, James, would you agree that if England did move the ball quicker,
[3846.00 - 3848.00] P:1921.43 E:0.096916 |  that Wales would have issues?
[3848.00 - 3851.00] P:1842.13 E:0.113262 |  It's going to be a gamble if Wales do go on the tack
[3851.00 - 3853.00] P:1747.04 E:0.103896 |  when we retain the ball better and we attack.
[3853.00 - 3856.00] P:1763.87 E:0.095786 |  Look, there's going to be gaps there for England to exploit,
[3856.00 - 3858.00] P:1702.12 E:0.106096 |  and Wales have got to hope that they don't exploit us.
[3858.00 - 3860.00] P:1854.76 E:0.095946 |  The guys who are left defensive-balance-wise
[3860.00 - 3862.00] P:1715.58 E:0.093902 |  have to do a great job for Wales, the reality.
[3862.00 - 3865.00] P:1521.66 E:0.083140 |  Wales have to score some goals in this match.
[3866.00 - 3870.00] P:1774.69 E:0.092504 |  Big old substitution that's just happened here.
[3870.00 - 3875.00] P:1644.16 E:0.087037 |  Gareth Bale is off and Brennan Johnson is on.
[3875.00 - 3877.00] P:1804.17 E:0.096485 |  So remember, Iran-Neil USA won.
[3877.00 - 3879.00] P:1777.28 E:0.100545 |  If you want to watch that, it is on BBC Two.
[3879.00 - 3883.00] P:1840.65 E:0.089689 |  If you want to watch Wales England, it's on BBC One.
[3883.00 - 3885.00] P:1851.24 E:0.092320 |  But you can hit the red button
[3885.00 - 3888.00] P:1876.94 E:0.086887 |  and you can get our commentary with the pictures.
[3888.00 - 3891.00] P:1784.30 E:0.098867 |  It's all synced up, it won't be delayed or anything else.
[3891.00 - 3894.00] P:1840.81 E:0.087366 |  And then you can enjoy, hopefully, the second half
[3894.00 - 3899.00] P:1755.52 E:0.091102 |  in the company of Matt Upsson and the one and only John Murray.
[3899.00 - 3901.00] P:1902.19 E:0.080875 |  Very good.
[3901.00 - 3903.00] P:1959.12 E:0.089648 |  Well, that's a big moment.
[3903.00 - 3905.00] P:1975.85 E:0.082368 |  Gareth Bale is substituted.
[3905.00 - 3909.00] P:1885.56 E:0.085385 |  So is that the end of his career in international football?
[3909.00 - 3912.00] P:1891.01 E:0.101173 |  And indeed, what will he do after this match?
[3912.00 - 3916.00] P:1881.37 E:0.076525 |  And clearly, the question cannot be answered
[3916.00 - 3919.00] P:1748.81 E:0.101225 |  until we know what's happening to Wales in this tournament.
[3919.00 - 3921.00] P:1859.29 E:0.094666 |  But that could be it, Matt Upsson.
[3921.00 - 3923.00] P:1779.67 E:0.099237 |  Yeah, it has potential, doesn't it?
[3923.00 - 3925.00] P:1871.45 E:0.097614 |  It's come off at half-time.
[3925.00 - 3928.00] P:1800.87 E:0.093336 |  Whether or not that's a sweep for Brennan Johnson coming on,
[3928.00 - 3930.00] P:1815.11 E:0.102163 |  who's quite a lively, bright young player.
[3930.00 - 3932.00] P:1921.33 E:0.074931 |  He's got a good bit of pace.
[3932.00 - 3935.00] P:1836.81 E:0.082146 |  He can go past players, good runner with the ball.
[3935.00 - 3939.00] P:1795.53 E:0.087283 |  Obviously, Gareth Bale is there for those moments, those free kicks.
[3939.00 - 3941.00] P:1800.60 E:0.104384 |  The responsibility of taking penalties,
[3941.00 - 3944.00] P:1888.54 E:0.108203 |  dealing with the pressure is obviously excellent with that.
[3944.00 - 3946.00] P:1719.70 E:0.097326 |  But he hasn't been effective in this game so far.
[3946.00 - 3949.00] P:1839.86 E:0.096589 |  Whether or not Rob Pace just thinks freshening it up in that area,
[3949.00 - 3953.00] P:1774.55 E:0.093020 |  the pitch is an essential thing for Wales in given the situation.
[3953.00 - 3958.00] P:1909.59 E:0.093607 |  So that is it for the 33-year-old Gareth Bale in this match.
[3958.00 - 3965.00] P:1805.31 E:0.088162 |  And the 21-year-old Brennan Johnson of Nottingham Forest comes on instead.
[3965.00 - 3969.00] P:1789.58 E:0.092382 |  So, Johnson on the right-hand side, which is where Gareth Bale was playing,
[3969.00 - 3972.00] P:1716.93 E:0.093163 |  but he was almost anonymous in the first half, Gareth Bale.
[3972.00 - 3975.00] P:1787.40 E:0.075849 |  And you can understand why the decision is there.
[3975.00 - 3977.00] P:1911.61 E:0.086706 |  Tough decision, but he's made it.
[3977.00 - 3979.00] P:1840.71 E:0.085167 |  Tough call, but he wasn't effective,
[3979.00 - 3981.00] P:1672.82 E:0.103556 |  wasn't involved in the player getting on the ball.
[3981.00 - 3983.00] P:1873.08 E:0.081030 |  Brennan Johnson has an opportunity now
[3983.00 - 3987.00] P:1884.83 E:0.088072 |  to show that he's the player that should start in that position.
[3987.00 - 3990.00] P:1893.06 E:0.099999 |  Wales-0, England-0. Five-life BBC sounds.
[3990.00 - 3994.00] P:1935.65 E:0.093114 |  The match, Wales have to win if they're going to stand a chance of going through.
[3994.00 - 3996.00] P:1902.99 E:0.102866 |  But they need the other match to be a draw,
[3996.00 - 3998.00] P:1987.52 E:0.091998 |  and it is currently Iran-0, USA-1.
[3998.00 - 4000.00] P:2004.43 E:0.097809 |  England just have to...
[4000.00 - 4003.00] P:1869.66 E:0.110610 |  As Ramsey will go for a long pass looking for Brennan Johnson,
[4003.00 - 4006.00] P:1987.97 E:0.095575 |  who I think felled Luke Shaw.
[4006.00 - 4009.00] P:2022.77 E:0.101384 |  Shaw went down in the D on the edge of the box.
[4009.00 - 4011.00] P:1947.32 E:0.100707 |  I think that was given as a free kick.
[4011.00 - 4013.00] P:1884.78 E:0.110049 |  Yeah, it was a free kick. Just a little shove
[4013.00 - 4015.00] P:1802.05 E:0.103582 |  and pushing the back on Luke Shaw,
[4015.00 - 4018.00] P:1909.65 E:0.081360 |  but, you know, I like the start, the Wales thinking.
[4018.00 - 4020.00] P:1830.31 E:0.081615 |  Brennan Johnson got high up the pitch.
[4020.00 - 4023.00] P:1859.03 E:0.091311 |  He's got the pace to get beyond Luke Shaw.
[4023.00 - 4025.00] P:1741.71 E:0.095170 |  If the pass is right, and he times his run white,
[4025.00 - 4029.00] P:1816.50 E:0.082381 |  he's capable of getting in on goal if everything comes together.
[4029.00 - 4033.00] P:1818.43 E:0.087867 |  But Gareth Bale's been involved in so many big moments for his clubs.
[4033.00 - 4038.00] P:1958.07 E:0.095578 |  And, of course, the Wales, the free kick that actually got them here
[4038.00 - 4041.00] P:1795.31 E:0.095425 |  against Ukraine in June. Wales have not won since that match.
[4041.00 - 4044.00] P:1829.46 E:0.092719 |  It'd be interesting to hear what Jane Ludlow's thoughts are
[4044.00 - 4049.00] P:1841.01 E:0.088375 |  on that substitution on the decision to take off Gareth Bale at half time.
[4049.00 - 4052.00] P:1724.53 E:0.087721 |  Well, to be fair, I think it saw a stat half time
[4052.00 - 4055.00] P:1795.86 E:0.096380 |  where it was 0% pass completion from Gareth Bale.
[4055.00 - 4058.00] P:1739.88 E:0.097948 |  He hardly touched the ball first half.
[4058.00 - 4062.00] P:1906.70 E:0.095126 |  So, you know, probably the right decision from Pagie, but a tough one.
[4062.00 - 4065.00] P:1921.00 E:0.086700 |  And every Welsh person loves Gareth Bale. We'll always love him
[4065.00 - 4068.00] P:1672.60 E:0.100701 |  for everything he's done for us as a nation so far in his career,
[4068.00 - 4071.00] P:1524.89 E:0.102472 |  whether that continues or not. We love him to bits.
[4071.00 - 4074.00] P:1894.52 E:0.068872 |  Thanks, Jane. Wales, Nail, England, Nail.
[4074.00 - 4077.00] P:1807.48 E:0.104026 |  Five-live. And we're watching England coming forward from left to right
[4077.00 - 4079.00] P:1849.73 E:0.088891 |  in this second half.
[4079.00 - 4082.00] P:1817.99 E:0.097012 |  And here's Phil Forden taking the ball up on the left-hand side,
[4082.00 - 4085.00] P:1936.01 E:0.114783 |  not going to run towards the edge of the penalty area and goes down.
[4085.00 - 4088.00] P:1974.19 E:0.107561 |  And the referee just thought a moment but then gives it.
[4088.00 - 4090.00] P:2020.59 E:0.097882 |  It's a free kick. The challenge.
[4090.00 - 4093.00] P:1949.32 E:0.101157 |  Forden running at pace at the Welsh defence.
[4093.00 - 4096.00] P:1760.91 E:0.090190 |  You know, that's the sort of exciting play that people want to see from Phil Forden.
[4096.00 - 4099.00] P:1767.20 E:0.098139 |  That's why they wanted him on the field against the United States.
[4099.00 - 4103.00] P:1860.95 E:0.083894 |  And in the end, he was just caught there, I think, by Jor-Rodon.
[4103.00 - 4106.00] P:1902.10 E:0.088640 |  Yep, he was Rodon with the final touch.
[4106.00 - 4109.00] P:1890.17 E:0.081665 |  But there are the moments you want from Phil Forden
[4109.00 - 4114.00] P:1792.43 E:0.094990 |  picking the ball up on the left-hand side and driving inside with his right foot.
[4114.00 - 4119.00] P:1830.98 E:0.089617 |  And then actually just turning back onto his left which drew the tackle and the foul.
[4119.00 - 4123.00] P:1869.70 E:0.096621 |  And again, we're in that territory, aren't we?
[4123.00 - 4125.00] P:1903.45 E:0.112892 |  Here in trippier territory.
[4125.00 - 4129.00] P:1731.95 E:0.104625 |  Sticked these in for England and there's a big debate again.
[4129.00 - 4132.00] P:1754.96 E:0.109971 |  I mean, how many shirts around that ball? Seven?
[4132.00 - 4134.00] P:1761.37 E:0.108866 |  Walked by Harry Kane. He's walked away from it.
[4134.00 - 4136.00] P:1884.47 E:0.101287 |  It looks as though it's going to be Rashford.
[4136.00 - 4142.00] P:1900.16 E:0.099377 |  So the three kick that we saw in the first half, there was a mighty conch blow about it.
[4142.00 - 4146.00] P:1898.40 E:0.099629 |  It was worked quite intricately and didn't come to anything.
[4146.00 - 4149.00] P:1808.01 E:0.095649 |  This time Henderson standing in front of the ball.
[4149.00 - 4152.00] P:1814.18 E:0.097447 |  I mean, from this sort of position, it's 25 yards out.
[4152.00 - 4154.00] P:1874.69 E:0.079635 |  An angle on the left-hand side.
[4154.00 - 4156.00] P:1764.01 E:0.108818 |  You would think that Rashford would go for goal from here.
[4156.00 - 4159.00] P:1802.19 E:0.096750 |  I would have thought so. With power.
[4159.00 - 4162.00] P:1757.70 E:0.104734 |  Yeah, and that's what it looks like. Jordan Henderson runs away.
[4162.00 - 4166.00] P:1874.24 E:0.102890 |  So the stage is left to Marcus Rashford with the free kick.
[4166.00 - 4168.00] P:2062.26 E:0.110129 |  Oh, what a free kick!
[4168.00 - 4172.00] P:2014.67 E:0.115206 |  England take the lead and that was special.
[4172.00 - 4177.00] P:2027.73 E:0.116630 |  Marcus Rashford does it for England.
[4177.00 - 4183.00] P:2022.40 E:0.115605 |  And his teammates race after him down here off the field.
[4183.00 - 4186.00] P:2014.29 E:0.116171 |  And he is then ghosted by the ball.
[4186.00 - 4188.00] P:2029.26 E:0.111506 |  The opening goal.
[4188.00 - 4191.00] P:1952.02 E:0.123860 |  England lead Wales by one goal to nil.
[4191.00 - 4194.00] P:1963.09 E:0.110533 |  And Wales hopes of staying at this World Cup
[4194.00 - 4197.00] P:1955.83 E:0.106517 |  and now absolutely hanging by a thread.
[4197.00 - 4200.00] P:1927.31 E:0.107698 |  And England are heading for the top of the group.
[4200.00 - 4203.00] P:1959.71 E:0.097954 |  Rashford punches the air.
[4203.00 - 4205.00] P:1933.77 E:0.106460 |  What a great moment for him.
[4205.00 - 4207.00] P:1922.45 E:0.110999 |  His second goal at this World Cup.
[4207.00 - 4209.00] P:1954.55 E:0.100712 |  Wales nail England one.
[4209.00 - 4212.00] P:1866.45 E:0.111872 |  Well, we thought he was going to hit it from the position of the ball.
[4212.00 - 4215.00] P:1933.24 E:0.095643 |  And we thought he was going to hit it with power.
[4215.00 - 4218.00] P:1858.94 E:0.108324 |  He certainly did disappoint. It was a great strike.
[4218.00 - 4220.00] P:1928.17 E:0.104374 |  The ball goes in on the goalkeeper's side.
[4220.00 - 4225.00] P:1956.83 E:0.105615 |  So whether or not he's a little bit unsighted, warding goal.
[4225.00 - 4228.00] P:1941.38 E:0.115276 |  He's not standing far enough over to the left for me
[4228.00 - 4230.00] P:1905.24 E:0.115889 |  because he's got his wall on the other side.
[4230.00 - 4232.00] P:1875.26 E:0.098731 |  But take nothing away from the hit.
[4232.00 - 4237.00] P:1901.36 E:0.099995 |  Marcus Rashford's got that lovely ability to hit the ball quite flat with topspin.
[4237.00 - 4241.00] P:1908.27 E:0.101387 |  Gets plenty of dip on the ball and pace and power.
[4241.00 - 4244.00] P:1890.20 E:0.104434 |  And he rockets it into the far corner of the goal.
[4244.00 - 4247.00] P:1840.98 E:0.097866 |  Really good strike from Marcus Rashford.
[4247.00 - 4250.00] P:1806.55 E:0.095636 |  Wales nail England one.
[4250.00 - 4254.00] P:1884.75 E:0.099986 |  And it's the England supporters' voices that you can hear.
[4254.00 - 4256.00] P:1861.62 E:0.102678 |  Wales playing the ball out from the back.
[4256.00 - 4259.00] P:1862.13 E:0.098817 |  The match they have to win and now they're 1-0 down.
[4259.00 - 4261.00] P:1866.83 E:0.104585 |  Kane on the right-hand side plays it across.
[4261.00 - 4263.00] P:2028.74 E:0.119987 |  Forden arrives at the back post.
[4263.00 - 4265.00] P:2059.88 E:0.108309 |  It's 2-0.
[4265.00 - 4272.00] P:2046.09 E:0.111590 |  And Phil Forden now scores his first goal at a World Cup.
[4272.00 - 4275.00] P:2024.47 E:0.113577 |  Great moment for Rashford and seconds later.
[4275.00 - 4277.00] P:1943.52 E:0.115439 |  A great moment for Forden.
[4277.00 - 4279.00] P:2028.07 E:0.110135 |  2-0 England.
[4279.00 - 4282.00] P:1992.09 E:0.106955 |  I'm just looking at Phil Forden's face.
[4282.00 - 4285.00] P:1957.67 E:0.111702 |  He looks so elated. He doesn't know what to do almost.
[4285.00 - 4287.00] P:1964.68 E:0.101806 |  He's just got this massive beaming smile.
[4287.00 - 4291.00] P:1946.44 E:0.112639 |  Can't believe the opportunity he's just had at the back post.
[4291.00 - 4293.00] P:1940.30 E:0.105135 |  Attack that ball home.
[4293.00 - 4295.00] P:1903.11 E:0.111839 |  It's a cross from Harry Kane.
[4295.00 - 4299.00] P:1930.33 E:0.112719 |  England work it really well on the right-hand side.
[4299.00 - 4304.00] P:1939.93 E:0.106639 |  But you have to credit Phil Forden the way he gets in that far post.
[4304.00 - 4306.00] P:1869.01 E:0.115439 |  He sees the opportunity developed.
[4306.00 - 4309.00] P:1863.58 E:0.108648 |  He just doesn't stand on his heels and stay out of the pitch.
[4309.00 - 4312.00] P:1787.12 E:0.113771 |  He sees Harry Kane get his head up and he whips the ball.
[4312.00 - 4314.00] P:1935.40 E:0.095290 |  It's a brilliant cross.
[4314.00 - 4316.00] P:1822.81 E:0.114309 |  He literally rolls it right in between.
[4316.00 - 4318.00] P:1926.77 E:0.107781 |  Ward and Roden.
[4318.00 - 4320.00] P:1955.83 E:0.102667 |  Really nice pace on the ball in.
[4320.00 - 4322.00] P:1741.21 E:0.105269 |  It's so inviting from Harry Kane.
[4322.00 - 4327.00] P:1938.64 E:0.098492 |  He's got one thought in his mind to fizz that ball across the edge of the six-yard box.
[4327.00 - 4329.00] P:1816.66 E:0.111424 |  And there's Phil Forden just arriving.
[4329.00 - 4333.00] P:1886.50 E:0.088244 |  Simple tapping with his left foot to do England.
[4333.00 - 4339.00] P:1986.25 E:0.102920 |  Well, there's a moment that Phil Forden will remember for the rest of his days.
[4339.00 - 4342.00] P:1984.31 E:0.107707 |  Starting a match at the World Cup for the first time,
[4342.00 - 4346.00] P:1884.93 E:0.089929 |  Garret Southgate brought him in and now scoring as well.
[4346.00 - 4348.00] P:1823.08 E:0.109787 |  And England score two in two minutes.
[4348.00 - 4352.00] P:1932.79 E:0.094161 |  And Wales have been absolutely shattered by that.
[4352.00 - 4355.00] P:1969.51 E:0.101981 |  Garret Vale has been substituted.
[4355.00 - 4358.00] P:1929.34 E:0.104415 |  England have scored twice really in a matter of seconds.
[4358.00 - 4362.00] P:1941.42 E:0.092413 |  And now their hopes of staying on beyond this match,
[4362.00 - 4364.00] P:1968.37 E:0.102271 |  well, they are fading so quickly.
[4364.00 - 4366.00] P:1949.55 E:0.079826 |  Jane Ludlow.
[4366.00 - 4368.00] P:1993.00 E:0.125020 |  What shall I say?
[4368.00 - 4371.00] P:2027.80 E:0.114616 |  I sit here with two different feelings, I'll be honest.
[4371.00 - 4373.00] P:1999.63 E:0.110609 |  And you're a city staff member,
[4373.00 - 4377.00] P:1988.88 E:0.114015 |  so I'm so happy for Phil Forden and do what we expect him to do
[4377.00 - 4379.00] P:1887.98 E:0.101977 |  to be fair when he steps on the pitch.
[4379.00 - 4381.00] P:1858.65 E:0.112925 |  But I sit here also as a Welsh person
[4381.00 - 4385.00] P:1849.21 E:0.090117 |  and somebody who would have been desperate before the start of this game
[4385.00 - 4387.00] P:1648.07 E:0.102992 |  for the lads to do well.
[4387.00 - 4388.00] P:1787.02 E:0.074131 |  But we're not seeing it.
[4388.00 - 4390.00] P:1593.36 E:0.105300 |  And I just hope that they can keep it together now
[4390.00 - 4394.00] P:1772.01 E:0.093339 |  and not fall apart because that potentially could happen.
[4394.00 - 4396.00] P:1970.35 E:0.094559 |  The game's potentially gone.
[4396.00 - 4399.00] P:1880.07 E:0.104880 |  Is there an opportunity for Rob Page to put younger people on the pitch
[4399.00 - 4402.00] P:1967.97 E:0.088271 |  to gain experience potentially yet?
[4402.00 - 4404.00] P:1979.95 E:0.093333 |  Thank you, Jane.
[4404.00 - 4407.00] P:1900.53 E:0.091338 |  Yep, England now in complete control.
[4407.00 - 4410.00] P:1929.21 E:0.104918 |  It's changed in the almost a twinkling of an eye with those two goals.
[4410.00 - 4413.00] P:2022.60 E:0.108509 |  From Rashford and Forden, the two players that Garry Southgate
[4413.00 - 4415.00] P:1887.14 E:0.093253 |  has brought in tonight, playing in the wide positions
[4415.00 - 4418.00] P:1731.34 E:0.097538 |  either side of Kane, and Kane sets up the goal for Forden.
[4418.00 - 4421.00] P:1838.12 E:0.095808 |  It's interesting, isn't it, with that team selection,
[4421.00 - 4424.00] P:1862.63 E:0.100505 |  as you've mentioned, John, the players that have been brought in
[4424.00 - 4427.00] P:1940.95 E:0.087839 |  and impacted the game with goals.
[4427.00 - 4429.00] P:1874.44 E:0.104235 |  I mean, it took a little while to get going.
[4429.00 - 4433.00] P:1754.51 E:0.101802 |  We thought it would open up or hoped it would open up in the second half.
[4433.00 - 4435.00] P:1842.85 E:0.084926 |  England have made that happen in fairness
[4435.00 - 4437.00] P:1670.97 E:0.100497 |  with that free kick from Rashford.
[4437.00 - 4439.00] P:1754.78 E:0.087423 |  I mean, I had a look again.
[4439.00 - 4441.00] P:1872.71 E:0.104955 |  I can ask questions of the goalkeeper.
[4441.00 - 4443.00] P:1802.35 E:0.099298 |  You shouldn't really get beat that easily on that side.
[4443.00 - 4445.00] P:1718.04 E:0.112945 |  If you're going to set your wall up on the right,
[4445.00 - 4448.00] P:1875.68 E:0.089847 |  you have to cover the other side of the goal better.
[4448.00 - 4452.00] P:1860.88 E:0.090273 |  But it was a really good strike for Marcus Rashford in the corner
[4452.00 - 4455.00] P:1993.84 E:0.094995 |  and a decent height as well.
[4455.00 - 4458.00] P:1912.73 E:0.104790 |  So, Wales now, it's a full-on hope, you'd have to say.
[4458.00 - 4460.00] P:1848.66 E:0.099586 |  Ramsey crossing from the right-hand side,
[4460.00 - 4462.00] P:1800.23 E:0.097475 |  but it's beyond Keitha Moore in the middle.
[4462.00 - 4466.00] P:1851.07 E:0.093833 |  It reaches out here on the left-hand side.
[4466.00 - 4469.00] P:1957.66 E:0.105934 |  The ball driven right across from James,
[4469.00 - 4471.00] P:1951.61 E:0.112805 |  across the face of the England six-yard box
[4471.00 - 4473.00] P:1980.75 E:0.108678 |  and beyond the far post.
[4473.00 - 4475.00] P:1921.61 E:0.110968 |  The goal came to England.
[4475.00 - 4477.00] P:1923.74 E:0.108921 |  No one can get a touch in the middle.
[4477.00 - 4478.00] P:1738.12 E:0.116073 |  A good response from Wales, though.
[4478.00 - 4479.00] P:1769.46 E:0.098551 |  Straight up the other end of the pitch.
[4479.00 - 4480.00] P:1871.55 E:0.101211 |  Two good crosses.
[4480.00 - 4483.00] P:1796.95 E:0.100314 |  One Keitha Moore nearly gets his head on the end.
[4483.00 - 4485.00] P:1921.41 E:0.082396 |  Dan James keeps the ball in,
[4485.00 - 4489.00] P:1863.94 E:0.100898 |  puts it onto his right foot and just whips the ball across the face.
[4489.00 - 4492.00] P:1891.04 E:0.084549 |  He's only just bouncing wider the far post.
[4492.00 - 4495.00] P:1902.80 E:0.096194 |  Remember the equation tonight coming into this match,
[4495.00 - 4498.00] P:1845.50 E:0.102654 |  what England had to do was avoid a four-goal defeat.
[4498.00 - 4502.00] P:1956.73 E:0.091489 |  Now, they're leading by two goals to nil.
[4502.00 - 4505.00] P:1741.06 E:0.097972 |  And the question is, with this goal line, two nil here,
[4505.00 - 4507.00] P:1888.90 E:0.087852 |  really who from the other match
[4507.00 - 4509.00] P:1931.62 E:0.091371 |  is going to go through as group runners-up?
[4509.00 - 4512.00] P:1857.02 E:0.092880 |  And what's the latest with that Conor McNamara?
[4512.00 - 4513.00] P:1788.12 E:0.116482 |  Well, at the moment, it's USA John.
[4513.00 - 4516.00] P:1585.08 E:0.103411 |  Iran nailed USA one, but one goal can change everything through the round.
[4516.00 - 4518.00] P:1869.64 E:0.114092 |  Keep a ball, goal for goal, it's deflected,
[4518.00 - 4520.00] P:1871.05 E:0.097580 |  and that's a very good save by Pickford.
[4520.00 - 4522.00] P:1888.70 E:0.102930 |  He had to adjust very quickly there.
[4522.00 - 4524.00] P:1882.38 E:0.102357 |  Moore had a goal for 25 yards
[4524.00 - 4526.00] P:1906.68 E:0.097411 |  and Pickford moving to his left.
[4526.00 - 4529.00] P:1841.31 E:0.093606 |  It took a big deflection off the head of...
[4529.00 - 4530.00] P:1839.21 E:0.068212 |  John Stones.
[4530.00 - 4531.00] P:1754.20 E:0.118107 |  ...or Stones, was it?
[4531.00 - 4532.00] P:1715.14 E:0.092202 |  No, it was the player.
[4532.00 - 4536.00] P:1728.45 E:0.104912 |  It was the player, and Pickford reacted really well, pushing away to his right.
[4536.00 - 4539.00] P:1775.12 E:0.101893 |  Sometimes his defender, you're almost better off just leaving that one.
[4539.00 - 4542.00] P:1706.15 E:0.097171 |  As the shot goes in, getting that little touch
[4542.00 - 4544.00] P:1716.82 E:0.092334 |  is sometimes worse for the goalkeeper.
[4544.00 - 4548.00] P:1762.20 E:0.098641 |  He glances it, and Jordan Pickford had to really get to his right-hand side quickly.
[4548.00 - 4550.00] P:1877.91 E:0.084651 |  Wales first corner, they take it quickly.
[4550.00 - 4552.00] P:1878.88 E:0.069908 |  Ramsey gives it back to James.
[4552.00 - 4557.00] P:1911.52 E:0.089233 |  James ball across the box, and then it's headed away, and the offside flag is up in any case.
[4557.00 - 4560.00] P:1916.27 E:0.075551 |  And now, Wales are having a go.
[4560.00 - 4563.00] P:1837.92 E:0.094391 |  They're having a go as they did towards the end of the first half,
[4563.00 - 4565.00] P:1728.55 E:0.075332 |  but they're having a go when they're 2-0 down.
[4565.00 - 4567.00] P:1713.88 E:0.082868 |  Yes, so often the case, isn't it?
[4567.00 - 4571.00] P:1689.25 E:0.098057 |  You know, teams sometimes free up a little bit when they feel it's over,
[4571.00 - 4574.00] P:1760.91 E:0.095206 |  or the pressure isn't there to try and keep that clean sheet,
[4574.00 - 4576.00] P:1650.84 E:0.105589 |  and they can loosen up and go forwards, because, like you say,
[4576.00 - 4581.00] P:1831.97 E:0.102095 |  the game at the moment is dead and buried for them, so they have to free up a little bit.
[4581.00 - 4585.00] P:1921.83 E:0.099696 |  Wales-nil, England 2, substitution in the offing.
[4585.00 - 4587.00] P:1864.35 E:0.093853 |  Juliet Farrington down, pick side.
[4587.00 - 4590.00] P:1939.50 E:0.093500 |  Free substitutions, a triple substitution.
[4590.00 - 4594.00] P:1861.27 E:0.100179 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold taking his instruction from Garry Southgate.
[4594.00 - 4598.00] P:1808.62 E:0.093786 |  Callum Wilson will also be coming on as to Calvin Phillips.
[4598.00 - 4601.00] P:1755.08 E:0.098875 |  A lot of strapping on that shoulder with Calvin Phillips,
[4601.00 - 4604.00] P:1824.52 E:0.090918 |  but they're already getting to the edge of the pitch,
[4604.00 - 4608.00] P:1921.96 E:0.091346 |  and that triple substitution is about to be made just very, very quickly.
[4608.00 - 4613.00] P:1909.92 E:0.089734 |  John, on Marcus Rashford, after he scored that goal, he went down to his knees,
[4613.00 - 4616.00] P:1969.24 E:0.090777 |  he pointed to the skies, he crossed his chest before the match restarted
[4616.00 - 4618.00] P:1958.04 E:0.102344 |  and before Phil Foden scored England's second,
[4618.00 - 4621.00] P:1838.43 E:0.100278 |  but the triple substitution now underway.
[4621.00 - 4624.00] P:1905.86 E:0.105354 |  Yes, England making this triple change,
[4624.00 - 4629.00] P:1821.63 E:0.097650 |  and I think this is an indication that Garry Southgate now is comfortable, confident
[4629.00 - 4634.00] P:1834.49 E:0.096938 |  that England will win the group, because Harry Kane is coming off,
[4634.00 - 4638.00] P:1915.20 E:0.084333 |  Declan Rice is coming off, and also Kyle Walkat,
[4638.00 - 4641.00] P:1837.58 E:0.088096 |  who's made his comeback tonight in terms of starting a match.
[4641.00 - 4646.00] P:1882.32 E:0.083534 |  So, changes being made, and let's bring in Micah Richards as well.
[4646.00 - 4649.00] P:1779.27 E:0.088783 |  Things have changed rather, Micah, since we last heard from you.
[4649.00 - 4652.00] P:1816.91 E:0.081549 |  Absolutely brilliant, exactly what the game needed.
[4652.00 - 4655.00] P:1725.84 E:0.075649 |  If you look at England and where they've set up in the second half,
[4655.00 - 4658.00] P:1836.65 E:0.088117 |  they've pressed the ball, which needed to the second goal.
[4658.00 - 4662.00] P:1802.45 E:0.081464 |  Great free kick from Rashford, but we talked about Foden,
[4662.00 - 4666.00] P:1772.60 E:0.086513 |  and his lack of minutes in this tournament.
[4666.00 - 4670.00] P:1922.87 E:0.086155 |  Even if he's not scoring or assisting, he creates space for others.
[4670.00 - 4673.00] P:1685.46 E:0.080924 |  On this occasion, he nips in at the back post,
[4673.00 - 4677.00] P:1777.82 E:0.075444 |  and he's just... he brings so much to this team.
[4677.00 - 4680.00] P:1593.66 E:0.079719 |  And for me, I've been starting him every game.
[4680.00 - 4684.00] P:1819.04 E:0.084814 |  Matt? Yeah, I agree, I love his reaction,
[4684.00 - 4687.00] P:1711.84 E:0.095143 |  because he is a fair way back when Harry Kane wins the ball
[4687.00 - 4689.00] P:1693.57 E:0.094422 |  or gets the ball at his feet.
[4689.00 - 4692.00] P:1579.97 E:0.101502 |  He has to make up a lot of ground to get in at that far post,
[4692.00 - 4697.00] P:1762.87 E:0.078496 |  but he's got this kind of brain that identifies things so quickly.
[4697.00 - 4700.00] P:1682.74 E:0.088157 |  So, he's able to react, sprint into that back post.
[4700.00 - 4703.00] P:1682.44 E:0.102712 |  Okay, it's a simple tapping, but it's all about the vision of seeing it
[4703.00 - 4706.00] P:1778.57 E:0.081893 |  and then getting yourself into that area.
[4706.00 - 4708.00] P:1825.34 E:0.062960 |  I thought he did that. Excellent.
[4708.00 - 4712.00] P:1952.12 E:0.071651 |  So, Wales nil England 2.
[4712.00 - 4716.00] P:1872.19 E:0.097836 |  And the place has still not resumed,
[4716.00 - 4719.00] P:1814.56 E:0.106450 |  because there's a stoppage,
[4719.00 - 4723.00] P:1878.51 E:0.097351 |  and we're actually going to see Ben Davis taking off the field.
[4723.00 - 4727.00] P:1814.60 E:0.104904 |  Now, what the problem was there with him,
[4727.00 - 4729.00] P:1845.54 E:0.095319 |  he wasn't entirely clear,
[4729.00 - 4735.00] P:1783.91 E:0.095955 |  Joel Morell of Portsmouth is being sent on by Rob Page,
[4735.00 - 4739.00] P:1669.00 E:0.093479 |  and Ben Davis is walking away, I see, down there, the Tottenham man,
[4739.00 - 4743.00] P:1913.59 E:0.090689 |  and walking away down the tunnel with his head bowed.
[4743.00 - 4746.00] P:1883.94 E:0.101257 |  So, 2 nil to England.
[4746.00 - 4750.00] P:1902.58 E:0.104456 |  England heading through as group winners with this scoreline.
[4750.00 - 4752.00] P:1740.75 E:0.110868 |  And Iran USA latest, Konan McNamara.
[4752.00 - 4755.00] P:1772.22 E:0.117360 |  Yeah, jeopardy here. Iran need a goal.
[4755.00 - 4757.00] P:1723.63 E:0.098136 |  Their World Cup comes to an end tonight.
[4757.00 - 4760.00] P:1742.80 E:0.103816 |  Iran nil USA 1 Pulisic, who scored just before half-time,
[4760.00 - 4762.00] P:1771.33 E:0.091972 |  had to be substituted during the break.
[4762.00 - 4765.00] P:1742.43 E:0.096662 |  He was injured in the process of scoring the goal.
[4765.00 - 4767.00] P:1574.67 E:0.098832 |  Saman Gedos, the Brentford player, has come on,
[4767.00 - 4770.00] P:1651.51 E:0.094211 |  and he's had a chance for Iran and put it over the crossbar.
[4770.00 - 4772.00] P:1759.64 E:0.100500 |  That's been their only decent opportunity so far,
[4772.00 - 4776.00] P:1638.17 E:0.096344 |  but one goal can change everything here. Iran nil USA 1.
[4776.00 - 4778.00] P:1727.49 E:0.049863 |  Thank you, Konan.
[4778.00 - 4781.00] P:1913.50 E:0.075146 |  So, England making those three changes, Matt Upson,
[4781.00 - 4785.00] P:1774.14 E:0.084519 |  as the ball goes back to Danny Ward, who passes it out from the back,
[4785.00 - 4788.00] P:1818.76 E:0.089324 |  and then Jo-Alan's put under pressure,
[4788.00 - 4791.00] P:1861.52 E:0.083375 |  and Morell, who's just come on in midfield,
[4791.00 - 4796.00] P:1912.91 E:0.092793 |  ball played to the left-hand side, Konan Roberts has now moved across to the left flank.
[4796.00 - 4801.00] P:1891.57 E:0.081170 |  So, there's been a little rejig by Wales and Rob Page.
[4801.00 - 4804.00] P:1840.76 E:0.099111 |  I think the England substitutions are not too surprising.
[4804.00 - 4809.00] P:1851.95 E:0.094097 |  Maybe the plan for Karl Walker all along might have just been an hour.
[4809.00 - 4813.00] P:1839.84 E:0.092068 |  Just about on that hour mark now, the other substitutions,
[4813.00 - 4815.00] P:1677.63 E:0.100387 |  they make total sense for me.
[4815.00 - 4817.00] P:1604.74 E:0.115919 |  Declan Rice played nearly every minute.
[4817.00 - 4819.00] P:1658.77 E:0.110642 |  Harry Kane, he'll play every minute, so to give those guys a break
[4819.00 - 4824.00] P:1748.35 E:0.096233 |  and an opportunity for Calvin Phillips and Alan Wilson,
[4824.00 - 4827.00] P:1786.69 E:0.099566 |  to do the squad the world of good.
[4827.00 - 4830.00] P:1840.06 E:0.088488 |  What we're seeing there is these players being given an opportunity
[4830.00 - 4833.00] P:1801.03 E:0.107723 |  for a bit of game time to use the squad,
[4833.00 - 4837.00] P:1802.31 E:0.096995 |  and also something of an international comeback as well for Callum Wilson
[4837.00 - 4839.00] P:1942.12 E:0.096033 |  and Trent Alexander-Arnold,
[4839.00 - 4842.00] P:1959.72 E:0.103526 |  and Calvin Phillips making his comeback from Interies.
[4842.00 - 4845.00] P:1757.79 E:0.117547 |  Jordan Henderson is caught by Ramsey.
[4845.00 - 4848.00] P:1789.68 E:0.100051 |  He was running away from Aaron Ramsey, and he's caught him there,
[4848.00 - 4853.00] P:1799.73 E:0.087429 |  and he's gone down, and it was right next to one of the pitchside microphones.
[4853.00 - 4855.00] P:1921.46 E:0.077493 |  Didn't sound good, did it?
[4855.00 - 4857.00] P:1875.91 E:0.094490 |  Really didn't sound good.
[4857.00 - 4861.00] P:1848.55 E:0.096009 |  It's a poor tackle from Aaron Ramsey from behind.
[4861.00 - 4865.00] P:1792.40 E:0.095649 |  He catches Jordan Henderson, who's still laying on the floor,
[4865.00 - 4870.00] P:1839.98 E:0.089384 |  holding his right ankle, and he let out a really big yelp.
[4870.00 - 4873.00] P:1803.12 E:0.085256 |  Yeah, he did. It was a blood-curdling scream.
[4873.00 - 4875.00] P:1507.37 E:0.106043 |  Yeah, he's ankle, just in the replay.
[4875.00 - 4878.00] P:1849.57 E:0.079953 |  His ankles turned and kind of just plants in the turf
[4878.00 - 4880.00] P:1422.65 E:0.090447 |  as the tackle comes in from Ramsey.
[4880.00 - 4882.00] P:1716.46 E:0.092921 |  He really catches that right ankle of Jordan Henderson.
[4882.00 - 4884.00] P:1877.86 E:0.078013 |  Looks nasty on the replay.
[4884.00 - 4888.00] P:1920.10 E:0.081241 |  And a yellow card for Aaron Ramsey.
[4888.00 - 4892.00] P:1908.46 E:0.096501 |  So 2-0 to England.
[4892.00 - 4895.00] P:1931.62 E:0.099533 |  Where do Wales go, Jane Ludlow, now in this?
[4895.00 - 4897.00] P:1926.10 E:0.102191 |  What do they do?
[4897.00 - 4899.00] P:2000.73 E:0.117488 |  I mean, it's a vain hope, isn't it?
[4899.00 - 4902.00] P:1914.97 E:0.074712 |  But I suppose wireless hope?
[4902.00 - 4905.00] P:1956.04 E:0.103230 |  Yeah, look, if you're standing on that touchline tonight,
[4905.00 - 4910.00] P:1832.78 E:0.100420 |  I think definitely Rob Page's thoughts now are the future,
[4910.00 - 4913.00] P:1817.54 E:0.100296 |  and how do you use the next 30 minutes of this game
[4913.00 - 4917.00] P:1756.41 E:0.106838 |  to benefit the Welsh national team going forwards?
[4917.00 - 4920.00] P:1824.11 E:0.102551 |  And is that giving opportunities to the younger generation of players
[4920.00 - 4923.00] P:1810.18 E:0.097589 |  so that they get used to the pressure of playing in these tournaments
[4923.00 - 4925.00] P:1782.31 E:0.092995 |  and playing against the calibre of players
[4925.00 - 4927.00] P:1854.56 E:0.085740 |  that they've come up against tonight?
[4929.00 - 4931.00] P:1923.96 E:0.109675 |  Well, Jordan Henderson has got to a 3-0.
[4931.00 - 4933.00] P:1988.28 E:0.105985 |  It looks as though he's OK.
[4933.00 - 4935.00] P:2026.39 E:0.109461 |  It's clearly a painful one, but he's all right
[4935.00 - 4937.00] P:1954.97 E:0.087077 |  and he's able to walk back onto the 3-0.
[4937.00 - 4939.00] P:2035.61 E:0.106474 |  The trouble with those is, it's one of those
[4939.00 - 4943.00] P:2073.44 E:0.111815 |  where tomorrow morning, your ankle could be twice the size.
[4943.00 - 4945.00] P:1797.15 E:0.092197 |  It's that kind of ankle roll.
[4945.00 - 4948.00] P:1776.49 E:0.098301 |  Hopefully it's not, and hopefully be able to just settle it down
[4948.00 - 4950.00] P:1720.37 E:0.101214 |  and ice it up and it'll be fine.
[4950.00 - 4952.00] P:1701.20 E:0.095375 |  But he's moving about OK.
[4952.00 - 4954.00] P:1790.43 E:0.080237 |  He's done well to get back on his feet,
[4954.00 - 4956.00] P:1804.99 E:0.087702 |  and he's just kind of running it off.
[4956.00 - 4958.00] P:1861.03 E:0.098186 |  Five Live at the World Cup.
[4958.00 - 4961.00] P:1646.75 E:0.094068 |  We'll have all of the reaction and debate and analysis
[4961.00 - 4964.00] P:1673.17 E:0.103131 |  on the Five Live World Cup Daily podcast from BBC Sounds.
[4964.00 - 4968.00] P:1576.37 E:0.106911 |  That's where you can rewind the live radio as well.
[4968.00 - 4970.00] P:1801.62 E:0.098484 |  I'm not sure I'd necessarily encourage you to rewind
[4970.00 - 4974.00] P:1779.87 E:0.111155 |  the first half of this match, but there we are.
[4974.00 - 4979.00] P:1794.99 E:0.096076 |  As Wales' winner-free kick for a fellow on Jules Rodon.
[4979.00 - 4981.00] P:1815.07 E:0.098152 |  You'll never be able to rewind the half-time,
[4981.00 - 4983.00] P:1666.88 E:0.100239 |  I'd say, with a quick little bit of distance.
[4983.00 - 4985.00] P:1548.58 E:0.118753 |  He has the chest in the holes.
[4985.00 - 4987.00] P:1716.35 E:0.095417 |  That could be worth it.
[4987.00 - 4989.00] P:1879.30 E:0.081638 |  Good suggestion, mate.
[4989.00 - 4993.00] P:1850.35 E:0.093015 |  And England, you know, how much has that changed
[4993.00 - 4995.00] P:1690.71 E:0.097349 |  our view on what's happening here tonight?
[4995.00 - 4997.00] P:1615.79 E:0.099507 |  What happened in those two minutes
[4997.00 - 5000.00] P:1594.73 E:0.095267 |  early in the second half when Rashford and Fulton score?
[5000.00 - 5003.00] P:1653.88 E:0.094112 |  Well, I think, you know, that is exactly what this game needed.
[5003.00 - 5005.00] P:1521.56 E:0.108667 |  It's what England needed to do in terms of coming out
[5005.00 - 5009.00] P:1675.49 E:0.093731 |  in the second half and assert their authority on the game.
[5009.00 - 5011.00] P:1728.47 E:0.082193 |  And, you know, Wales came out
[5011.00 - 5013.00] P:1690.78 E:0.091850 |  and looked to be a little bit more open.
[5013.00 - 5015.00] P:1685.79 E:0.089621 |  I think we worked the ball quite nicely.
[5015.00 - 5017.00] P:1775.59 E:0.066017 |  The moments of quality, weren't they?
[5017.00 - 5019.00] P:1792.22 E:0.085084 |  And they were few and far between in the first half.
[5019.00 - 5022.00] P:1664.27 E:0.089344 |  We didn't really see hardly any, did we?
[5022.00 - 5024.00] P:1704.98 E:0.100175 |  So Marcus Rashford with a really nice free kick.
[5024.00 - 5027.00] P:1730.85 E:0.090329 |  Harry Kane, good delivery into the box.
[5027.00 - 5029.00] P:1795.58 E:0.079897 |  Fulton and Fulton arriving.
[5029.00 - 5032.00] P:1791.23 E:0.077850 |  Just better key moments for England.
[5032.00 - 5034.00] P:1816.58 E:0.081505 |  Another thing that occurs to me,
[5034.00 - 5037.00] P:1753.46 E:0.083065 |  is that the first goal that we've seen direct from a free kick?
[5037.00 - 5039.00] P:1832.94 E:0.085858 |  At least well-cooked.
[5039.00 - 5041.00] P:1682.74 E:0.119499 |  You're asking me a question now.
[5041.00 - 5043.00] P:1861.79 E:0.079967 |  I've seen a few goals.
[5043.00 - 5048.00] P:1832.65 E:0.098725 |  I can't actually picture too many that go direct from a free kick.
[5048.00 - 5052.00] P:1791.71 E:0.101700 |  So Marcus Rashford scoring from round about 25 yards.
[5052.00 - 5054.00] P:1790.11 E:0.095395 |  It was beautifully struck as well.
[5054.00 - 5056.00] P:1830.71 E:0.112980 |  But I know that you had reservations.
[5056.00 - 5059.00] P:1733.38 E:0.100544 |  And here is Danny Ward, who pulls the ball into his left foot
[5059.00 - 5061.00] P:1841.52 E:0.106173 |  and clears to the halfway line.
[5061.00 - 5062.00] P:1736.65 E:0.094363 |  Road on is okay.
[5062.00 - 5064.00] P:1641.25 E:0.086412 |  Obscide flag against Rashford.
[5064.00 - 5066.00] P:1536.08 E:0.101405 |  And it's a free kick too.
[5066.00 - 5068.00] P:1744.74 E:0.073013 |  Reservations about the goalkeeper.
[5068.00 - 5071.00] P:1688.35 E:0.085917 |  I just think you listen to goalkeepers
[5071.00 - 5073.00] P:1687.31 E:0.084829 |  and they're talking about these kind of things.
[5073.00 - 5076.00] P:1741.03 E:0.088474 |  If you've got your wall one side
[5076.00 - 5078.00] P:1587.05 E:0.100288 |  and you get beat the other side,
[5078.00 - 5081.00] P:1648.99 E:0.087915 |  where you're supposed to be guarding that part of the goal,
[5081.00 - 5084.00] P:1500.34 E:0.113915 |  if somebody bends it over the wall into the opposite top corner or whatever,
[5084.00 - 5086.00] P:1728.25 E:0.111483 |  you have to kind of give them a little clap.
[5086.00 - 5089.00] P:1799.34 E:0.114018 |  But getting beat on your side is not acceptable.
[5089.00 - 5092.00] P:1869.02 E:0.109672 |  The Rockham Abdelhamid Sapir.
[5092.00 - 5093.00] P:1757.86 E:0.114958 |  So there's been one.
[5093.00 - 5095.00] P:1932.10 E:0.101616 |  Yes, so there has been one.
[5095.00 - 5097.00] P:1905.81 E:0.106255 |  The first free kick of this road.
[5097.00 - 5101.00] P:1827.31 E:0.098463 |  I think I was probably driving off into the desert at that stage.
[5101.00 - 5103.00] P:1826.99 E:0.104148 |  Trippieette is coming on.
[5103.00 - 5104.00] P:1709.87 E:0.087292 |  Probably.
[5104.00 - 5106.00] P:1787.27 E:0.089136 |  Yes, having taken the wrong turn.
[5106.00 - 5110.00] P:1720.43 E:0.094151 |  Trippieette is on and Shaw comes off.
[5110.00 - 5112.00] P:1510.94 E:0.100317 |  I'm not surprised by that either,
[5112.00 - 5115.00] P:1624.97 E:0.101837 |  because Luke Shaw is a very important player for England
[5115.00 - 5118.00] P:1665.33 E:0.088068 |  that this will come as the left back.
[5118.00 - 5122.00] P:1808.57 E:0.084452 |  And it's great to have the versatility of Kieran Trippieette, isn't it?
[5122.00 - 5124.00] P:1737.49 E:0.095467 |  You can fill in on that right side all.
[5124.00 - 5127.00] P:1759.25 E:0.066317 |  You look very comfortable at left back.
[5127.00 - 5129.00] P:1701.63 E:0.093442 |  Take a decent free kick as well.
[5129.00 - 5133.00] P:1756.92 E:0.086739 |  And it means that Kieran Trippieette can have a go on that side as well
[5133.00 - 5135.00] P:1754.10 E:0.083157 |  in the closing stages of this match.
[5135.00 - 5138.00] P:1818.76 E:0.097177 |  I mean, I know he's played there before, obviously many, many times.
[5138.00 - 5141.00] P:1738.37 E:0.077873 |  But not at this world cup yet.
[5141.00 - 5142.00] P:1763.68 E:0.082006 |  So Trippieette is on.
[5142.00 - 5144.00] P:1808.58 E:0.079961 |  Wales nail England 2
[5144.00 - 5148.00] P:1843.84 E:0.094492 |  and Wales going all the way back to go keep up the wall.
[5148.00 - 5150.00] P:1749.39 E:0.102806 |  Back to Iran, USA.
[5150.00 - 5155.00] P:1773.41 E:0.106108 |  Yeah, USA still in position to go through behind England into the last 16.
[5155.00 - 5159.00] P:1591.43 E:0.097254 |  As things stand, we've got just over a quarter of the match to go.
[5159.00 - 5161.00] P:1767.00 E:0.088403 |  The Christian Pulisic goal was the difference.
[5161.00 - 5163.00] P:1613.16 E:0.103421 |  Iran haven't been as good today as they were against Wales.
[5163.00 - 5166.00] P:1712.78 E:0.092548 |  But remember, both Iran goals against Wales
[5166.00 - 5168.00] P:1701.60 E:0.094561 |  came in stoppage time on Friday.
[5168.00 - 5170.00] P:1705.66 E:0.093201 |  They won't give up to the very end.
[5170.00 - 5172.00] P:1634.06 E:0.101160 |  And one goal which an equaliser for Iran here,
[5172.00 - 5175.00] P:1635.76 E:0.083735 |  they would move into second place in the group.
[5175.00 - 5178.00] P:1602.74 E:0.069452 |  I think Iran scored goals in the eighth, the eleventh,
[5178.00 - 5182.00] P:1733.71 E:0.098500 |  and the 13th minutes of out of time at this world cup.
[5182.00 - 5187.00] P:1812.15 E:0.097286 |  Bows out of play for a throwing to Wales inside their own half.
[5187.00 - 5192.00] P:1731.97 E:0.075772 |  But England have got complete control now in this match.
[5192.00 - 5196.00] P:1729.78 E:0.091080 |  And I think you can take your pen out
[5196.00 - 5198.00] P:1816.47 E:0.084460 |  and you can go to your wall chart
[5198.00 - 5203.00] P:1585.17 E:0.076993 |  and you can begin to write Netherlands against USA
[5203.00 - 5206.00] P:1570.51 E:0.076950 |  and Senegal against England.
[5206.00 - 5208.00] P:1604.37 E:0.105971 |  We spoke at half time, you said to me about that.
[5208.00 - 5211.00] P:1481.84 E:0.112632 |  Wales are going to have to come out in the second half.
[5211.00 - 5215.00] P:1750.35 E:0.108335 |  And I said to you, I'm not sure if they can come out
[5215.00 - 5217.00] P:1745.51 E:0.118788 |  and actually be effective and get a hold of the ball.
[5217.00 - 5219.00] P:1700.91 E:0.108439 |  And I think it's been such a tricky game for them
[5219.00 - 5221.00] P:1679.99 E:0.112644 |  to be able to get a hold of the ball.
[5221.00 - 5223.00] P:1701.98 E:0.116434 |  They just haven't had it all game really.
[5223.00 - 5226.00] P:1707.48 E:0.102032 |  Maybe don't like USA just yet, Conor McNamara.
[5226.00 - 5228.00] P:1768.09 E:0.114095 |  Don't fill in your wall chart yet
[5228.00 - 5230.00] P:1797.83 E:0.104644 |  because Iran have had their best chance.
[5230.00 - 5232.00] P:1935.40 E:0.103878 |  Get us again, the halftime substitute.
[5232.00 - 5235.00] P:1924.84 E:0.107095 |  He tried to wrap his foot around it, he's about 12 yards out.
[5235.00 - 5237.00] P:2028.21 E:0.091898 |  This is a glorious chance.
[5237.00 - 5239.00] P:1832.24 E:0.097989 |  He's slightly has to step back onto it
[5239.00 - 5241.00] P:1854.69 E:0.096502 |  and that he puts the laces through it.
[5241.00 - 5243.00] P:1860.78 E:0.102757 |  But that is the biggest let-off for the United States.
[5243.00 - 5245.00] P:1761.18 E:0.099245 |  They remain 1-0 in front
[5245.00 - 5247.00] P:1680.02 E:0.098399 |  and at the moment they are going through.
[5247.00 - 5249.00] P:1855.94 E:0.080229 |  But that's the best we've seen from Iran.
[5249.00 - 5251.00] P:1703.27 E:0.084120 |  That's where the drama is now.
[5251.00 - 5253.00] P:1769.90 E:0.083050 |  England with the ball at the back.
[5253.00 - 5256.00] P:1835.18 E:0.090652 |  Pickford playing it out to Stones to his right.
[5256.00 - 5258.00] P:1880.73 E:0.084686 |  Stones chips it forward.
[5258.00 - 5260.00] P:1740.78 E:0.098639 |  Alexander-Arnold now back to Calvin Phillips.
[5260.00 - 5262.00] P:1905.91 E:0.082699 |  And Phillips hits a long pass
[5262.00 - 5265.00] P:1817.73 E:0.106994 |  with the top of his right foot over the top to Rashford.
[5265.00 - 5266.00] P:1856.79 E:0.097558 |  What a good pass that was.
[5266.00 - 5268.00] P:1818.61 E:0.104250 |  Rashford into the penalty area.
[5268.00 - 5270.00] P:2034.39 E:0.115622 |  And Rashford shoots and scores!
[5270.00 - 5272.00] P:1937.45 E:0.116067 |  Straight through Danny Ward.
[5272.00 - 5275.00] P:1902.40 E:0.118089 |  That's a bad one for the Welsh goalkeeper.
[5275.00 - 5278.00] P:1951.89 E:0.111738 |  But Rashford scores his second goal of the match.
[5278.00 - 5281.00] P:1902.93 E:0.116839 |  And England lead by three goals to mill.
[5281.00 - 5284.00] P:1875.46 E:0.106265 |  And England can prepare to go through
[5284.00 - 5287.00] P:1830.65 E:0.110279 |  into the knockout stages as the group winners.
[5287.00 - 5291.00] P:1904.29 E:0.107263 |  I just love so many different things about that goal.
[5291.00 - 5293.00] P:1869.07 E:0.104252 |  I love how direct it was.
[5293.00 - 5295.00] P:1833.06 E:0.109563 |  I love the vision of Calvin Phillips
[5295.00 - 5297.00] P:1621.38 E:0.109700 |  to be able to chip that ball over the top.
[5297.00 - 5300.00] P:1784.50 E:0.105397 |  Knowing he's got the pace of Marcus Rashford
[5300.00 - 5302.00] P:1763.43 E:0.102412 |  to get behind the right back.
[5302.00 - 5304.00] P:1777.01 E:0.110255 |  He had a little gamble on the shorter ball.
[5304.00 - 5307.00] P:1891.59 E:0.090065 |  Rashford was the wrong side.
[5307.00 - 5309.00] P:1828.85 E:0.098996 |  Calvin Phillips sees it.
[5309.00 - 5311.00] P:1794.16 E:0.099253 |  Brilliant ball over the top.
[5311.00 - 5314.00] P:1767.80 E:0.106559 |  And from this position, he's got a couple of options, Marcus Rashford.
[5314.00 - 5316.00] P:1819.96 E:0.095397 |  He could set Callum Wilson,
[5316.00 - 5319.00] P:1694.71 E:0.096087 |  but such is his confidence after that free kick.
[5319.00 - 5321.00] P:1720.30 E:0.094415 |  He's on a roll at the moment.
[5321.00 - 5323.00] P:1844.63 E:0.102859 |  Third goal in the tournament.
[5323.00 - 5325.00] P:1771.76 E:0.098353 |  He drifts it onto his left foot.
[5325.00 - 5327.00] P:1638.65 E:0.102355 |  It's just a lovely clean strike.
[5327.00 - 5329.00] P:1617.69 E:0.080861 |  He goes through Ward's legs in goal.
[5329.00 - 5331.00] P:1549.64 E:0.103025 |  He could maybe save it
[5331.00 - 5333.00] P:1733.43 E:0.089204 |  if he's really in a good position with his feet.
[5333.00 - 5335.00] P:1802.44 E:0.092946 |  But it just hits the inside of his heel
[5335.00 - 5337.00] P:1780.77 E:0.096820 |  and he goes into the back of the net
[5337.00 - 5339.00] P:1850.81 E:0.092026 |  because he hits it with real power.
[5339.00 - 5341.00] P:1851.37 E:0.085602 |  It's just such a confident goal from Marcus Rashford.
[5341.00 - 5344.00] P:1749.87 E:0.095060 |  So, Wales nil, England 3.
[5344.00 - 5346.00] P:1790.30 E:0.094532 |  Two goals for Rashford.
[5346.00 - 5348.00] P:1890.36 E:0.108291 |  He's on a hat trick.
[5348.00 - 5350.00] P:1985.86 E:0.097290 |  Phil Forden scoring the one in between.
[5350.00 - 5353.00] P:1858.61 E:0.099014 |  And Rashford looks alive.
[5353.00 - 5355.00] P:1742.29 E:0.086518 |  Yeah, confident.
[5355.00 - 5358.00] P:1764.26 E:0.090673 |  And he can tell, can't he, that just the fact that he's took that chance on
[5358.00 - 5360.00] P:1819.97 E:0.076244 |  with his left foot tells you where he's at
[5360.00 - 5362.00] P:1646.46 E:0.090247 |  in terms of feeling that he can score.
[5362.00 - 5364.00] P:1715.33 E:0.054082 |  And that's brilliant for England.
[5364.00 - 5366.00] P:1705.25 E:0.082422 |  So, mentioned for Marcus Rashford,
[5366.00 - 5370.00] P:1740.73 E:0.082782 |  this is only the second match that he's started
[5370.00 - 5373.00] P:1833.33 E:0.088460 |  at a World Cup or a European Championship.
[5373.00 - 5375.00] P:1868.47 E:0.095759 |  And it's his fourth tournament.
[5375.00 - 5377.00] P:1887.17 E:0.099698 |  Lots of substitute appearances.
[5377.00 - 5380.00] P:1698.50 E:0.092193 |  It's actually his 15th appearance, but only his second start.
[5380.00 - 5383.00] P:1639.37 E:0.094318 |  So, straight away,
[5383.00 - 5385.00] P:1646.29 E:0.105106 |  what that does to you mentally,
[5385.00 - 5388.00] P:1585.74 E:0.093804 |  you've been to so many tournaments and not really played a part
[5388.00 - 5390.00] P:1701.68 E:0.106857 |  and just been training and part of the squad.
[5390.00 - 5392.00] P:1758.12 E:0.093501 |  It's not easy.
[5392.00 - 5394.00] P:1621.47 E:0.112235 |  Getting this opportunity for him, he must be feeling that
[5394.00 - 5396.00] P:1500.15 E:0.101322 |  I've got to grab this with both hands.
[5396.00 - 5398.00] P:1759.90 E:0.089241 |  If I get on the grass, I've got to show my worth.
[5398.00 - 5400.00] P:1539.64 E:0.088567 |  And he's done that in his World Cup.
[5400.00 - 5402.00] P:1658.66 E:0.104062 |  Long ball downfield for Wales, Keven Moore gets his chest to it.
[5402.00 - 5404.00] P:1823.92 E:0.093812 |  Dan James tries to get there, but England,
[5404.00 - 5407.00] P:1871.81 E:0.104985 |  Calvin Kolbs it is, comes across and then Trent Alexander-Arnold
[5407.00 - 5409.00] P:1660.04 E:0.093896 |  hits a high pass downfield, looking for
[5409.00 - 5411.00] P:1617.47 E:0.086823 |  Callum Wilson through the middle.
[5411.00 - 5413.00] P:1666.62 E:0.090441 |  But Jo-Alan is back in possession.
[5413.00 - 5415.00] P:1699.19 E:0.092329 |  He just sees, passes Trent Alexander-Arnold,
[5415.00 - 5417.00] P:1447.32 E:0.099849 |  that he just, no one else sees, you know,
[5417.00 - 5420.00] P:1536.57 E:0.102157 |  and he's got the technical capability to execute it.
[5420.00 - 5422.00] P:1787.61 E:0.110642 |  Brennan Johnson receives it from Ramsey,
[5422.00 - 5424.00] P:1825.61 E:0.100304 |  and Brennan Johnson pulls it across,
[5424.00 - 5426.00] P:1879.84 E:0.091616 |  but John Stones is able to step across
[5426.00 - 5428.00] P:1748.12 E:0.101189 |  and Phil Forden is able to play it downfield
[5428.00 - 5431.00] P:1810.23 E:0.099602 |  with a half-way line, Wilson, and a thick.
[5431.00 - 5433.00] P:1885.30 E:0.102281 |  It's a shame.
[5433.00 - 5435.00] P:1748.93 E:0.108533 |  Great touch, wasn't it?
[5435.00 - 5437.00] P:1657.16 E:0.102852 |  First touch was there from Callum Wilson, brilliant hold-off,
[5437.00 - 5439.00] P:1840.71 E:0.104961 |  but just misplaced his pass.
[5439.00 - 5442.00] P:1833.36 E:0.114924 |  That's Matt Upson, played for England at the World Cup,
[5442.00 - 5444.00] P:1930.84 E:0.102160 |  scored for England at the World Cup.
[5444.00 - 5446.00] P:1812.63 E:0.117007 |  Jane Ludlow is with us tonight as well,
[5446.00 - 5448.00] P:1749.03 E:0.109329 |  back in the BBC studio,
[5448.00 - 5451.00] P:1621.39 E:0.089025 |  and the Games Up channel, afraid it's good for Wales.
[5451.00 - 5454.00] P:1327.68 E:0.100303 |  Yeah, once our second goal went in, it was up then,
[5454.00 - 5456.00] P:1706.09 E:0.093977 |  but I think, you know, the third goal,
[5456.00 - 5458.00] P:1465.00 E:0.071952 |  when you look at that from a Welsh perspective,
[5458.00 - 5460.00] P:1601.23 E:0.086229 |  it's a trend of this World Cup has been
[5460.00 - 5463.00] P:1370.53 E:0.091683 |  how poor Wales have been pressing in the opposition half,
[5463.00 - 5467.00] P:1381.86 E:0.097377 |  and you can see why Robert Page decided to go with a low block first half
[5467.00 - 5470.00] P:1648.86 E:0.083025 |  to try and give Wales a chance, because it's a part of our game,
[5470.00 - 5473.00] P:1607.78 E:0.097602 |  that in previous campaigns has been phenomenal.
[5473.00 - 5476.00] P:1705.29 E:0.092913 |  It's been great, but in this World Cup it's been awful.
[5476.00 - 5479.00] P:1803.01 E:0.080785 |  Our pressing organisation opposition half has just kept...
[5479.00 - 5481.00] P:1621.62 E:0.097606 |  It's just left us wide open defensively,
[5481.00 - 5484.00] P:1902.81 E:0.097010 |  our back form has struggled to be able to compete.
[5484.00 - 5487.00] P:1931.28 E:0.104135 |  Morrell deflects the ball into the path of Wilson,
[5487.00 - 5489.00] P:1767.67 E:0.105687 |  and Wilson now up to the edge of the area,
[5489.00 - 5491.00] P:1845.43 E:0.109387 |  and Rashford could be in for the hat-trick,
[5491.00 - 5494.00] P:1882.95 E:0.104323 |  which hits the shot, and it's saved by the left foot of Danny Ward.
[5494.00 - 5497.00] P:1833.26 E:0.107365 |  The shot from an angle, and Ward saves it with his left foot.
[5497.00 - 5500.00] P:1816.98 E:0.101114 |  Rashford wants that hat-trick. He's desperate for it.
[5500.00 - 5502.00] P:1892.82 E:0.119254 |  He's put loads of energy, loads of runs.
[5502.00 - 5505.00] P:1826.31 E:0.098881 |  Getting wide is completely different to the first half
[5505.00 - 5507.00] P:1738.91 E:0.106662 |  in the way that England are attacking,
[5507.00 - 5509.00] P:1874.16 E:0.083299 |  and I know the games change completely,
[5509.00 - 5513.00] P:1838.44 E:0.099111 |  but we're just going forward in surges, lots of white shirts, movement,
[5513.00 - 5517.00] P:1713.84 E:0.091859 |  overlapping players, and Rashford with his right foot strikes it.
[5517.00 - 5520.00] P:1651.20 E:0.099707 |  Not the most powerful of strikes, easily saved by Ward,
[5520.00 - 5523.00] P:1655.23 E:0.083386 |  but nonetheless there's another effort on goal from him.
[5523.00 - 5525.00] P:1713.61 E:0.085988 |  An actual fact in the second half.
[5525.00 - 5528.00] P:1597.26 E:0.084595 |  Suddenly England, the England that played against Iran.
[5528.00 - 5531.00] P:1805.37 E:0.077121 |  To corner then, from the right.
[5531.00 - 5535.00] P:1858.92 E:0.091135 |  Gordon plays it in, and Danny Ward's able to come and make the catch.
[5535.00 - 5538.00] P:1729.26 E:0.103162 |  And he has that ball in his hands.
[5538.00 - 5541.00] P:1787.57 E:0.084802 |  So USA one-lil up against Iran.
[5541.00 - 5544.00] P:1834.37 E:0.095854 |  Currently England going through as group winners,
[5544.00 - 5546.00] P:1733.78 E:0.103162 |  and USA has run us up,
[5546.00 - 5549.00] P:1781.77 E:0.107242 |  and Wales in danger of losing the ball on the edge of their own box,
[5549.00 - 5551.00] P:1778.09 E:0.091676 |  and Fodeners slipped into a challenge there,
[5551.00 - 5554.00] P:1787.01 E:0.103986 |  and just keeping an eye on him because he stayed down,
[5554.00 - 5556.00] P:1852.51 E:0.106536 |  and I think he's been caught,
[5556.00 - 5558.00] P:1805.36 E:0.102100 |  and now it's Wales at the other end with Johnson,
[5558.00 - 5560.00] P:1982.01 E:0.108288 |  who will shoot from the angle, but that's dropped by Trippia,
[5560.00 - 5562.00] P:1889.70 E:0.109057 |  and he's coming up to Bill Foden,
[5562.00 - 5565.00] P:1758.83 E:0.099526 |  and he's climbing to his feet, and he's in a little bit of pain there.
[5565.00 - 5567.00] P:1627.04 E:0.104669 |  And this is a worry for England.
[5567.00 - 5571.00] P:1696.75 E:0.091898 |  It was a slip, they slipped into the challenge, and...
[5571.00 - 5573.00] P:1698.04 E:0.092769 |  Marcus Rashford sat down as well.
[5573.00 - 5575.00] P:1611.04 E:0.080484 |  And Rashford has also sat down.
[5575.00 - 5578.00] P:1605.13 E:0.092726 |  Yeah, cramp Marcus Rashford, he's just stretching his calf out,
[5578.00 - 5579.00] P:1748.68 E:0.114118 |  but the Foden one...
[5579.00 - 5580.00] P:1729.61 E:0.097963 |  Thought it was on his feet.
[5580.00 - 5581.00] P:1832.59 E:0.106766 |  Foden was on his feet.
[5581.00 - 5582.00] P:1866.30 E:0.108654 |  It was a bit awkward, wasn't it?
[5582.00 - 5585.00] P:1850.51 E:0.098253 |  He tried to put the brakes on with the tackle, with Roden,
[5585.00 - 5589.00] P:1762.31 E:0.099817 |  and he just got his right ankle just caught underneath him as Roden comes in.
[5589.00 - 5594.00] P:1838.32 E:0.084055 |  So like he jarred it in the serve, actually, is the right ankle.
[5594.00 - 5600.00] P:1815.65 E:0.089572 |  Juliet Barrington had a view from that, from the pitch side.
[5600.00 - 5601.00] P:1815.31 E:0.110488 |  Yeah, I'm just watching him now,
[5601.00 - 5604.00] P:1667.52 E:0.091769 |  and he just sort of bent over again to give it a little feel.
[5604.00 - 5608.00] P:1708.15 E:0.090709 |  I think it's his right ankle, and it was just a clash of collision,
[5608.00 - 5612.00] P:1684.51 E:0.081774 |  or the sliding, he slid with Roden around him.
[5612.00 - 5616.00] P:1695.19 E:0.089157 |  Just on Marcus Rashford, he's now joined to top goal scorer in the race
[5616.00 - 5617.00] P:1473.15 E:0.084989 |  for the Golden Boot.
[5617.00 - 5619.00] P:1394.11 E:0.095840 |  John, I thought you would have had that one ready.
[5619.00 - 5623.00] P:1752.42 E:0.104280 |  There's a few of them there, it's a log jam on three Jules.
[5623.00 - 5628.00] P:1681.36 E:0.076348 |  I want them through them just at the moment.
[5628.00 - 5630.00] P:1703.53 E:0.085266 |  Wales Nill, England three.
[5630.00 - 5633.00] P:1808.17 E:0.089469 |  What's happening in Iran-USA, Connor?
[5633.00 - 5636.00] P:1740.14 E:0.090584 |  It's less than 20 minutes to go plus the stopper,
[5636.00 - 5639.00] P:1604.98 E:0.098395 |  so this is very, very tense now for Iran.
[5639.00 - 5640.00] P:1498.80 E:0.089740 |  Iran-Nil, USA one.
[5640.00 - 5642.00] P:1679.06 E:0.104882 |  USA have not been able to turn the screw.
[5642.00 - 5645.00] P:1645.74 E:0.088541 |  They haven't been able to add to Christian Bullisic's opening goal
[5645.00 - 5648.00] P:1635.42 E:0.097812 |  just ahead of half-time, and Iran are beginning to sense
[5648.00 - 5649.00] P:1633.27 E:0.088365 |  they might be creeping into it.
[5649.00 - 5652.00] P:1725.38 E:0.099156 |  A double change to Kali and Tauravi have both come on.
[5652.00 - 5656.00] P:1784.53 E:0.076122 |  It is Iran-Nil, USA one.
[5656.00 - 5662.00] P:1750.33 E:0.085565 |  So it's in the balance for the United States, but not so for England.
[5662.00 - 5663.00] P:1793.61 E:0.092929 |  Three-nil up.
[5663.00 - 5665.00] P:1758.99 E:0.085865 |  Two goals for Rashford.
[5665.00 - 5667.00] P:1730.98 E:0.089952 |  Forden seems to be okay.
[5667.00 - 5670.00] P:1761.24 E:0.091676 |  Rashford, just thinking it was a little bit of cramp.
[5670.00 - 5673.00] P:1837.84 E:0.092062 |  Yeah.
[5673.00 - 5676.00] P:1875.88 E:0.120178 |  So England have the ball at the back and winning a throw-in
[5676.00 - 5677.00] P:1752.83 E:0.094351 |  in the left-back position.
[5677.00 - 5681.00] P:1701.18 E:0.089490 |  And I think Garth Southgate is just having a look.
[5681.00 - 5684.00] P:1740.24 E:0.090049 |  He's made now the England manager.
[5684.00 - 5691.00] P:1797.43 E:0.100641 |  Four of his changes, and it is Jack Grealish
[5691.00 - 5694.00] P:1688.53 E:0.107888 |  who is coming on now on Nill Mercy here
[5694.00 - 5698.00] P:1914.69 E:0.113821 |  against the Tyring Wales who are heading out of the World Cup.
[5698.00 - 5699.00] P:1994.87 E:0.116278 |  And that's it.
[5699.00 - 5700.00] P:1911.21 E:0.112937 |  Marcus Rashford actually saw.
[5700.00 - 5703.00] P:1942.29 E:0.116219 |  I think that tells us that Phil Forden is okay.
[5703.00 - 5706.00] P:1991.44 E:0.110839 |  Otherwise, Forden would be off the field now.
[5706.00 - 5710.00] P:1968.95 E:0.111459 |  And Rashford, he just looks a little bit as though he's been affected by that cramp.
[5710.00 - 5711.00] P:1967.55 E:0.116362 |  Walks off the field.
[5711.00 - 5713.00] P:1944.93 E:0.116484 |  Two goal, Marcus Rashford.
[5713.00 - 5714.00] P:1843.39 E:0.106951 |  What a great night for him.
[5714.00 - 5720.00] P:1762.74 E:0.098556 |  And Garth Southgate comes across and puts his left arm around his shoulders
[5720.00 - 5722.00] P:1575.14 E:0.103094 |  and says, well done, young man.
[5722.00 - 5723.00] P:1663.19 E:0.109731 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[5723.00 - 5725.00] P:1511.08 E:0.094237 |  Big pat on the back for him.
[5725.00 - 5726.00] P:1629.40 E:0.110001 |  He's had a great evening.
[5726.00 - 5729.00] P:1350.51 E:0.099684 |  He started with a massive opportunity for him.
[5729.00 - 5731.00] P:1564.08 E:0.092776 |  And he has grabbed it with both hands.
[5731.00 - 5733.00] P:1730.99 E:0.100639 |  Something that I really feel he needed to do.
[5733.00 - 5739.00] P:1733.22 E:0.075188 |  He's done it well and he gets a good stand innovation from England fans
[5739.00 - 5744.00] P:1800.89 E:0.083228 |  to our right behind the goal who fully appreciated his job tonight.
[5744.00 - 5747.00] P:1807.97 E:0.076620 |  Yeah, he had the chance to get the hat trick.
[5747.00 - 5750.00] P:1781.93 E:0.106279 |  But England with the ball deep inside their own heart,
[5750.00 - 5753.00] P:1834.78 E:0.109443 |  it's been won forward by Bannigan who passes it crossfield.
[5753.00 - 5756.00] P:1850.89 E:0.105362 |  Alexander-Arnold's able to get the ball under control.
[5756.00 - 5761.00] P:1687.22 E:0.099922 |  And he will have a look forward and actually set off and a run himself.
[5761.00 - 5765.00] P:1581.28 E:0.105958 |  Alexander-Arnold, look towards the centre circle to Cullum Wilson.
[5765.00 - 5767.00] P:1565.62 E:0.110308 |  And then Alexander-Arnold again in the challenge.
[5767.00 - 5772.00] P:1561.89 E:0.114047 |  Now out of position, he's held Joe Morrell so it is a free kick to Wetzel.
[5772.00 - 5778.00] P:1572.98 E:0.111155 |  I think you can also take from this game that Jude Bellingham likes playing that slightly deeper role for England.
[5778.00 - 5783.00] P:1849.68 E:0.111334 |  To me, he looks so at home, so comfortable, doing a defensive job,
[5783.00 - 5786.00] P:1805.78 E:0.111727 |  winning balls back in his own heart from that driving run.
[5786.00 - 5790.00] P:1662.79 E:0.115378 |  Whether he goes past the player or passes it, he gets it back.
[5790.00 - 5796.00] P:1531.42 E:0.110457 |  But I just love seeing him come from deep as opposed to receiving the ball with his back to goal
[5796.00 - 5799.00] P:1506.99 E:0.105726 |  and having to work in that area of the pitch.
[5799.00 - 5801.00] P:1375.41 E:0.112749 |  Harry Wilson has replaced Dan James.
[5801.00 - 5803.00] P:1649.27 E:0.117919 |  It's been given away by Ramsey.
[5803.00 - 5807.00] P:1833.40 E:0.108386 |  Wilson takes it up to the edge of the area and he gives it to his left.
[5807.00 - 5809.00] P:1867.89 E:0.111138 |  And it's struck forwards by Bellingham, it's saved.
[5809.00 - 5814.00] P:1816.84 E:0.109732 |  And then turned wide in the six yard box somehow by Phil Forden,
[5814.00 - 5818.00] P:1802.01 E:0.099345 |  who had the goal in front of him, there were a couple of defenders coming in.
[5818.00 - 5821.00] P:1893.49 E:0.104646 |  He was slightly off balance and he hooked it wide somehow.
[5821.00 - 5823.00] P:1989.73 E:0.101842 |  Unbelievable this really.
[5823.00 - 5825.00] P:1778.55 E:0.105010 |  It's a decent save from Warden.
[5825.00 - 5828.00] P:1853.34 E:0.094262 |  It's a bad mistake from Wows that gave the ball away initially.
[5828.00 - 5833.00] P:1837.34 E:0.089643 |  Cullum Wilson was able just to pick the ball up and he's driving at the edge of the penalty box.
[5833.00 - 5837.00] P:1643.92 E:0.081288 |  It's a nice pass to his left, to Bellingham.
[5837.00 - 5842.00] P:1726.50 E:0.091950 |  On his right foot he tries to bend it round to the far post with his right foot.
[5842.00 - 5849.00] P:1673.17 E:0.101472 |  It's a little bit central, Ward gets down and deals with it and then the rebound can't turn that in either.
[5849.00 - 5851.00] P:1654.06 E:0.094295 |  But poor mistake from Wows.
[5851.00 - 5857.00] P:1657.02 E:0.095036 |  They've got to make sure they don't give loose balls away like that and make the score line even worse for themselves.
[5857.00 - 5866.00] P:1623.18 E:0.088347 |  Wows coming forward but this is the end of this World Cup journey for Wows here tonight.
[5866.00 - 5874.00] P:1642.19 E:0.084689 |  They've been able to get through the knockout stages at every World Cup or European Championship that they've played at,
[5874.00 - 5878.00] P:1658.10 E:0.085224 |  but not at Qatar 2022.
[5878.00 - 5885.00] P:1605.43 E:0.095074 |  It really hasn't happened for them and they have looked like a team at the end of the cycle.
[5885.00 - 5891.00] P:1479.16 E:0.106209 |  They looked a bit tired at times, hasn't it, and not got that freshness or energy to be able to impact the game
[5891.00 - 5896.00] P:1689.61 E:0.099623 |  or even change the game, which is where I think they've been really disappointed.
[5896.00 - 5901.00] P:1566.85 E:0.104012 |  Still USA lead around by one goal to nil, so they are going through as Groupon as up,
[5901.00 - 5909.00] P:1525.04 E:0.103355 |  but that match in the last 16, I think you can put that on your wall chart, Senegal against England.
[5909.00 - 5919.00] P:1658.60 E:0.104583 |  And that is Sunday, the 4th of December, it will be 7 o'clock in the evening and that will be up at the Al Bay Stadium in the north of Doha here.
[5919.00 - 5927.00] P:1471.00 E:0.098272 |  Tonight we are out to the west and after this, Wales will be heading back west, back home.
[5927.00 - 5935.00] P:1552.79 E:0.093542 |  And with just the one point that they were able to get from the opening draw against the United States.
[5935.00 - 5945.00] P:1645.50 E:0.088768 |  Marcus Rashford with his goals tonight, joining Enne Valencia, Kylian Mbappe and Cody Gacpol who are on 3.
[5945.00 - 5952.00] P:1595.59 E:0.086361 |  So we talked about Harry Kane as the potential Golden Boot winner, Matt, but instead...
[5952.00 - 5960.00] P:1465.65 E:0.098126 |  Yeah, I mean, it's a tough call before a competition, you'd always put him as a name in and amongst the list, wouldn't you, with his goal record.
[5960.00 - 5969.00] P:1480.24 E:0.096119 |  But Harry Kane would just be delighted that England are progressing and I think that for him, it's got massive personal goals obviously,
[5969.00 - 5978.00] P:1506.96 E:0.100621 |  but for England to be successful to play in those big semis or finals, or even win a World Cup for him is just an amazing experience.
[5978.00 - 5980.00] P:1527.44 E:0.108702 |  And he's set up another goal tonight.
[5980.00 - 5982.00] P:1516.37 E:0.106386 |  Yeah, he has, he's played his part hasn't he?
[5982.00 - 5987.00] P:1602.43 E:0.097021 |  And if you remember at the Euros last year, who's sterling who scored the goal in the group.
[5987.00 - 5992.00] P:1655.29 E:0.102571 |  And it was only in the knockout stages that Kane actually began to get on the score sheet, scored 4 goals in the knockout stage.
[5992.00 - 6000.00] P:1695.29 E:0.092631 |  Well, it's great you're getting goals from all over the pitch, it's another key thing for any good team that you can score from different areas of the field, from midfield,
[6000.00 - 6004.00] P:1553.38 E:0.100093 |  even if centre-backs come in, defenders, wide players, it all helps.
[6004.00 - 6012.00] P:1835.75 E:0.092527 |  It's another stoppage for an injury, I think that is going to be it for Joe Allen, who clearly was absolutely desperate.
[6012.00 - 6021.00] P:1810.81 E:0.097627 |  Rob Tage was desperate to have him here, you know, they've worked wonders to get him fit to play at this World Cup because of the hamstring injury that he suffered at Swansea.
[6021.00 - 6028.00] P:1719.50 E:0.107707 |  But that is it, he was able to come on as a substitute in the previous match, started this match, but that's it for him, Jened Luglow.
[6030.00 - 6036.00] P:1563.99 E:0.106757 |  Yeah, it's been great to get him on the pitch, if you're a Welsh fan, because another great servant for the national team.
[6036.00 - 6042.00] P:1349.04 E:0.097580 |  But it's also good, take positives from this, it's good to see the younger generation getting on the pitch now and let's see what they can do.
[6042.00 - 6050.00] P:1449.96 E:0.096029 |  It's not about getting the results in any shape or form tonight, it's about getting some exposure for our younger lads to start that transition process
[6050.00 - 6051.00] P:1364.26 E:0.092391 |  and look further ahead.
[6052.00 - 6059.00] P:1832.23 E:0.088544 |  Yeah, which is exactly what he's doing, Rob Tage bringing on Reuben Colwell of Cardiff, the 20-year-old for a taste of the World Cup action,
[6059.00 - 6068.00] P:1741.15 E:0.083890 |  even if it is in a situation where Wales are 3-0 down to England here after England have significantly upped it in the second half.
[6068.00 - 6076.00] P:1720.22 E:0.083535 |  And they have, haven't they? This second half performance has been reminiscent of the performance against the round.
[6076.00 - 6083.00] P:1703.69 E:0.094290 |  Yeah, it's gone up a couple of gears from the first half and whether or not it's partly because of Wales, but England have to take credit for that.
[6083.00 - 6091.00] P:1702.89 E:0.091804 |  Here is Grealish into the action, ball to Bellingham inside the penalty area, but it bounces away from him and Wales are able to clear it away downfield.
[6091.00 - 6102.00] P:1669.02 E:0.100832 |  We're into the last 10 minutes now, the thought will be in the closing stages to take commentary on the closing minutes of Iran against the United States
[6102.00 - 6106.00] P:1594.23 E:0.093565 |  because that match will decide who plays against the Netherlands on Saturday.
[6106.00 - 6113.00] P:1586.64 E:0.085570 |  And the other thing as well is with England playing on Sunday, that is now, you know, that's a significant gap now.
[6113.00 - 6114.00] P:1716.81 E:0.090476 |  Yeah.
[6114.00 - 6120.00] P:1661.47 E:0.098992 |  Which is the way that the draw has worked out. And England always knew this from the moment the draw was made in Doha on April the 1st,
[6120.00 - 6127.00] P:1564.26 E:0.084832 |  that if they were able to progress as group winners, they would have a significant break before the group and the next stage.
[6127.00 - 6137.00] P:1742.41 E:0.099126 |  It certainly plays a part, doesn't it, in making the landscape as good as what you can for yourself in tournament football in terms of recovery and preparation.
[6137.00 - 6139.00] P:1788.73 E:0.068187 |  It does make a difference.
[6139.00 - 6143.00] P:1668.24 E:0.093002 |  Ball played over the top for Wales and Harry Maguire, holes down.
[6143.00 - 6148.00] P:1839.26 E:0.096893 |  Kiefa Muir, which that could easily have been a yellow card for Harry Maguire.
[6148.00 - 6151.00] P:1729.22 E:0.111157 |  It could have been a hold of his shirt, big hand full of Kiefa Moir's shirt.
[6151.00 - 6153.00] P:1839.41 E:0.102026 |  He's been fortunate there.
[6153.00 - 6158.00] P:1812.38 E:0.098433 |  Yeah, because you do not want one of the central defenders to head into the knockout stages on a yellow card.
[6158.00 - 6159.00] P:1783.95 E:0.083984 |  No.
[6159.00 - 6160.00] P:1774.96 E:0.088950 |  And England are yet to pick one up.
[6160.00 - 6163.00] P:1799.14 E:0.087005 |  Yeah, absolutely. And it just got the wrong side of him.
[6163.00 - 6170.00] P:1667.14 E:0.091193 |  I think he just didn't read the situation quick enough. Kiefa Muir got the wrong side and then he was grappling with him to bring him back.
[6170.00 - 6172.00] P:1595.58 E:0.088299 |  So it is a free kick.
[6172.00 - 6175.00] P:1684.09 E:0.083070 |  England want to keep a clean sheet here tonight as well.
[6175.00 - 6180.00] P:1710.08 E:0.094450 |  Free kick is going to be taken for Wales by Harry Wilson, the recently arrived substitute.
[6180.00 - 6186.00] P:1636.41 E:0.094125 |  Harry Wilson, the full man is just wiping his brow with his left wrist.
[6186.00 - 6188.00] P:1745.98 E:0.092679 |  And Wilson hits the free kick into the wall.
[6188.00 - 6191.00] P:1738.14 E:0.107009 |  It bounces back for the Wales number eight on the far side.
[6191.00 - 6194.00] P:1750.62 E:0.092731 |  He's going to allow it to bounce out of play for a throw in.
[6194.00 - 6196.00] P:1684.26 E:0.074476 |  So back to Iran, USA.
[6196.00 - 6198.00] P:1523.83 E:0.104049 |  Conor McNamara is watching the pictures.
[6198.00 - 6205.00] P:1818.14 E:0.098432 |  18 minutes on the stadium clock in the United States, hanging on to this one-nil lead that they have because of Christian Pulisic's goal.
[6205.00 - 6206.00] P:1744.26 E:0.105159 |  There's a free kick to Iran.
[6206.00 - 6208.00] P:1724.62 E:0.095247 |  It is midway inside the United States half.
[6208.00 - 6211.00] P:1715.86 E:0.095982 |  They haven't had many of these attacking set pieces in the game.
[6211.00 - 6214.00] P:1740.58 E:0.099606 |  Remember, one goal would change everything if there could be an equaliser here.
[6214.00 - 6216.00] P:1763.50 E:0.100066 |  Iran would go through.
[6216.00 - 6221.00] P:1812.38 E:0.092660 |  If it finished 1-1, USA would go home even though they wouldn't have lost the game at this tournament.
[6221.00 - 6226.00] P:1807.20 E:0.098000 |  And just as they're about to take the free kick, the Americans are going to use a little bit of time wasting here and make a double change.
[6226.00 - 6228.00] P:1726.67 E:0.107194 |  But for the moment, John, Iran nil USA 1.
[6228.00 - 6237.00] P:1853.42 E:0.086141 |  As the Wales with Colwell has a go for goal from just outside the area, but it flies away over the top of the England crossbar.
[6237.00 - 6239.00] P:1644.40 E:0.093987 |  So Wales nil England 3.
[6239.00 - 6244.00] P:1716.96 E:0.096483 |  Now, we will have a choice of listening, by the way, later in the evening for you.
[6244.00 - 6249.00] P:1676.16 E:0.095139 |  Five Life Sport will continue until 6.06 at 10 o'clock.
[6249.00 - 6252.00] P:1559.21 E:0.091017 |  So Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton will take your calls.
[6252.00 - 6259.00] P:1582.24 E:0.088878 |  But also, Radio 1 are putting out a celebration playlist of tracks tonight, straight after the match,
[6259.00 - 6264.00] P:1605.31 E:0.102297 |  which was going to be, depending on which team were in the ascendancy tonight,
[6264.00 - 6268.00] P:1631.74 E:0.096077 |  maybe it would have been a Welshman, it would have been an Englishman.
[6268.00 - 6274.00] P:1615.38 E:0.100428 |  It is going to be Jordan Pickford's choice that you will hear on Radio 1 straight after this match.
[6274.00 - 6276.00] P:1628.45 E:0.099321 |  Do you think you'll have picked Chesney Hawks?
[6276.00 - 6277.00] P:1653.01 E:0.098813 |  Who knows?
[6277.00 - 6278.00] P:1271.30 E:0.107292 |  Hopefully.
[6278.00 - 6282.00] P:1573.78 E:0.088828 |  That would be it. I wonder if last time that was played on Radio 1.
[6282.00 - 6284.00] P:1547.34 E:0.090336 |  Wales nil England 3.
[6284.00 - 6286.00] P:1648.38 E:0.082784 |  Back to Iran USA. Conor.
[6286.00 - 6288.00] P:1820.20 E:0.106667 |  Stopping moment for the United States.
[6288.00 - 6292.00] P:1683.36 E:0.099730 |  Across from the right-hand side for Iran is the American defence trying to step out.
[6292.00 - 6294.00] P:1598.21 E:0.111096 |  There was this corridor of uncertainty. They were all on side.
[6294.00 - 6297.00] P:1684.61 E:0.104063 |  And the goalkeeper, Matt Ryan, held his nerve as the ball came in.
[6297.00 - 6299.00] P:1773.65 E:0.100490 |  It bounced off one of the Iranian attackers.
[6299.00 - 6303.00] P:1701.65 E:0.099743 |  There was an appeal. It may have come off an arm of a defender, Moore, who has just come on.
[6303.00 - 6308.00] P:1766.58 E:0.101580 |  I think he'll get away with that. And it's Iran nil USA 1. USA going through as it stands.
[6308.00 - 6313.00] P:1614.48 E:0.069714 |  England just knocking the ball around inside their own half.
[6313.00 - 6318.00] P:1663.35 E:0.079506 |  The damage was done in the early part of the second half of the match.
[6318.00 - 6322.00] P:1572.67 E:0.083547 |  England scoring their goals in the 50th, 52nd and 68th minutes.
[6322.00 - 6325.00] P:1732.07 E:0.076538 |  And after that, the game was up.
[6325.00 - 6328.00] P:1673.75 E:0.102045 |  Callum Wilson now takes the ball on through the middle. Nice touch from him.
[6328.00 - 6329.00] P:1761.85 E:0.085063 |  He just looks sharp.
[6329.00 - 6330.00] P:1948.27 E:0.122002 |  He's looked sharp.
[6330.00 - 6334.00] P:1579.52 E:0.098033 |  He really has Callum Wilson. The first game, and since he's come on today,
[6334.00 - 6340.00] P:1835.64 E:0.080245 |  he looks right at it for any little inkling of ball over the top, down the side.
[6340.00 - 6344.00] P:1818.36 E:0.086790 |  Just tried to throw a nice little shift of body weight there to throw.
[6344.00 - 6348.00] P:1798.15 E:0.094928 |  I think it was road in the wrong side. And then he could just go straight at the goal.
[6348.00 - 6351.00] P:1673.25 E:0.099779 |  And I think he's just got this direct mindset at the moment.
[6351.00 - 6355.00] P:1592.67 E:0.078059 |  It's a good player to bring on when the game's a little bit stretched.
[6356.00 - 6361.00] P:1753.16 E:0.090352 |  Yeah, having had to wait, well, three years actually,
[6361.00 - 6367.00] P:1755.23 E:0.089854 |  in between caps before he got this recall on the back of his Newcastle form.
[6367.00 - 6371.00] P:1629.11 E:0.084394 |  And England with the ball inside their own half,
[6371.00 - 6374.00] P:1781.39 E:0.082107 |  played up towards the figure of Jack Dreeleish there,
[6374.00 - 6377.00] P:1597.30 E:0.098854 |  but he's beaten to the ball and Wales will come forward again.
[6377.00 - 6380.00] P:1696.13 E:0.097505 |  And a long task looking for Moore on the edge of the box,
[6380.00 - 6384.00] P:1837.92 E:0.102236 |  and he's got the ball in the chest, sit down onto his right foot, and curling the shot.
[6384.00 - 6389.00] P:1901.16 E:0.097326 |  Blide and high, and Harry Maguire and John Stones.
[6389.00 - 6392.00] P:1852.00 E:0.091295 |  There are low fives in there, John Stones watched him,
[6392.00 - 6395.00] P:1727.08 E:0.091244 |  forced him onto the right foot and he couldn't get it on target.
[6395.00 - 6397.00] P:1654.53 E:0.102034 |  That was a good touch for him, Keith and Moore, just pulled off,
[6397.00 - 6400.00] P:1813.31 E:0.079541 |  brought the ball down on his chest, good control.
[6400.00 - 6405.00] P:1838.41 E:0.089484 |  But John Stones was a good distance away, matched him, striped for stride,
[6405.00 - 6409.00] P:1877.09 E:0.088626 |  just shuffling to try and block the shot, and in the end, Keith and Moore
[6409.00 - 6413.00] P:1935.01 E:0.072475 |  both rolled it with his right foot, but it was high and wide.
[6413.00 - 6417.00] P:1843.75 E:0.079444 |  So it's been a good night in the end for England,
[6417.00 - 6421.00] P:1789.74 E:0.084220 |  and for Gareth Southgate, and Phil Forden.
[6421.00 - 6425.00] P:1707.99 E:0.100923 |  I don't know who will get to interview after the match tonight.
[6425.00 - 6427.00] P:1708.35 E:0.096574 |  Rashford and Forden obviously will be on the list,
[6427.00 - 6430.00] P:1687.94 E:0.087225 |  we'll hear from Gareth Southgate as well in that hour,
[6430.00 - 6432.00] P:1813.02 E:0.079221 |  and reaction as well from the Welsh camp.
[6432.00 - 6434.00] P:1737.57 E:0.080204 |  I'm sure it'll be delighted Phil Forden.
[6434.00 - 6438.00] P:1695.52 E:0.085554 |  That was his first goal in 17 England appearances.
[6438.00 - 6442.00] P:1671.98 E:0.084480 |  If you remember, the two goals against Iceland at Wembley,
[6442.00 - 6444.00] P:1663.94 E:0.077080 |  but it's not scored since.
[6444.00 - 6446.00] P:1733.47 E:0.088764 |  So, great night for him.
[6446.00 - 6451.00] P:1743.36 E:0.082438 |  We'll keep you posted on what happens here at the Ahmed bin Ali stadium
[6451.00 - 6453.00] P:1704.25 E:0.091068 |  in the final minutes of this match,
[6453.00 - 6456.00] P:1657.14 E:0.093298 |  but England are going through as group winners, comfortable group winners.
[6456.00 - 6459.00] P:1664.91 E:0.089125 |  We'll be back here in a moment or two,
[6459.00 - 6465.00] P:1584.28 E:0.093518 |  but first the final stages in Iran, USA, with Conor McNamara.
[6465.00 - 6469.00] P:1718.50 E:0.102300 |  5 minutes of normal time to play, and this is still in the balance.
[6469.00 - 6472.00] P:1682.45 E:0.097259 |  Iran, Nill, USA won.
[6472.00 - 6475.00] P:1780.52 E:0.096701 |  Christian Pulisic scored the goal just before half-time,
[6475.00 - 6479.00] P:1679.52 E:0.096730 |  bravely bundling it over the line before colliding with the goalkeeper.
[6479.00 - 6481.00] P:1756.87 E:0.101968 |  He was to pick up an injury in that incident,
[6481.00 - 6483.00] P:1630.88 E:0.097694 |  he couldn't celebrate the goal at all.
[6483.00 - 6485.00] P:1661.46 E:0.098223 |  He's tried to soldier onto the break,
[6485.00 - 6487.00] P:1650.66 E:0.095026 |  but did not resume for the second half.
[6487.00 - 6489.00] P:1642.00 E:0.094471 |  And I think it's fair to say that the United States
[6489.00 - 6492.00] P:1736.50 E:0.095647 |  have missed Christian Pulisic in the second half.
[6492.00 - 6495.00] P:1684.13 E:0.094816 |  They haven't had a shot on target in the second period.
[6495.00 - 6497.00] P:1661.19 E:0.096043 |  Now, Josh Sargent has had to go off as well.
[6497.00 - 6501.00] P:1546.01 E:0.093506 |  He's been hurt, and they are lacking a bit of presence up front.
[6501.00 - 6503.00] P:1737.86 E:0.089771 |  Hadji Reider's come on.
[6503.00 - 6506.00] P:1635.06 E:0.098181 |  Shaquille Moore, Brendan Aronson of Leeds United has Iran...
[6506.00 - 6509.00] P:1651.57 E:0.091061 |  Iran have a possession, and they know that one goal here,
[6509.00 - 6511.00] P:1754.20 E:0.097389 |  not just would draw them level in the game,
[6511.00 - 6515.00] P:1661.72 E:0.089029 |  it would move them ahead of the United States in the group.
[6515.00 - 6518.00] P:1722.26 E:0.102578 |  So, this is high jeopardy now for the United States,
[6518.00 - 6521.00] P:1700.04 E:0.091763 |  as Ezzaloy plays it down the right-hand side,
[6521.00 - 6524.00] P:1793.46 E:0.097298 |  trying to pick out Jalali, one of the substitutes, has come on.
[6524.00 - 6527.00] P:1733.17 E:0.094599 |  It comes back to Rezzi, and the player who scored against Wales,
[6527.00 - 6529.00] P:1699.42 E:0.109778 |  last time out on Friday.
[6529.00 - 6533.00] P:1684.59 E:0.094558 |  USA are playing so deep here, they're pretty much all inside their final third.
[6533.00 - 6537.00] P:1647.03 E:0.093644 |  Simon Godos of Brentford, who had a good opportunity in the second half,
[6537.00 - 6540.00] P:1672.78 E:0.098107 |  but he put it over the top, and then that's a poor ball,
[6540.00 - 6542.00] P:1685.09 E:0.101478 |  played over the United States defenders,
[6542.00 - 6544.00] P:1711.55 E:0.090327 |  and it carries all the way through to Matt Turner,
[6544.00 - 6546.00] P:1548.30 E:0.098708 |  and the goalkeeper falls down on the ball.
[6546.00 - 6548.00] P:1783.94 E:0.102971 |  And there's a few boos and cheers,
[6548.00 - 6550.00] P:1685.10 E:0.107348 |  and a few hollers of the booboo Zayla as well,
[6550.00 - 6555.00] P:1729.89 E:0.093768 |  which has been the implement of choice for Iranian fans inside the stadium.
[6555.00 - 6559.00] P:1737.82 E:0.093819 |  There has been a yellow card shown to Hossein Qadani for a descent.
[6559.00 - 6562.00] P:1555.02 E:0.097070 |  It's a game that in the main has been competitive,
[6562.00 - 6565.00] P:1616.96 E:0.101354 |  but we haven't had too many nasty challenges in the game.
[6565.00 - 6569.00] P:1612.32 E:0.097472 |  We've had, I think, two yellow cards now, as down the left-hand side,
[6569.00 - 6571.00] P:1668.18 E:0.099151 |  a chance for the United States to attack, and had you right,
[6571.00 - 6573.00] P:1703.10 E:0.097730 |  lovely ball into the penalty area.
[6573.00 - 6575.00] P:1801.28 E:0.097062 |  Aronson's cross in, this could be it for the USA,
[6575.00 - 6577.00] P:1789.76 E:0.110736 |  Shaquille Moore, but he's off balance,
[6577.00 - 6579.00] P:1734.23 E:0.100632 |  he saw the penalty area on the right-hand side,
[6579.00 - 6581.00] P:1661.37 E:0.104552 |  he couldn't get his body angle the right way,
[6581.00 - 6583.00] P:1722.65 E:0.099458 |  and he couldn't get the shot on target,
[6583.00 - 6585.00] P:1571.63 E:0.097945 |  and Iran are able to clear it.
[6585.00 - 6587.00] P:1858.76 E:0.107603 |  A second goal for USA here would turn the screw,
[6587.00 - 6590.00] P:1727.22 E:0.101204 |  would seal the deal, but they're hanging on at the moment.
[6590.00 - 6593.00] P:1743.45 E:0.103028 |  The clock takes on, 87 minutes on the clock.
[6593.00 - 6595.00] P:1602.48 E:0.095551 |  Iran nil, USA 1.
[6595.00 - 6598.00] P:1712.83 E:0.098604 |  England is still leading Wales by three goals to nil,
[6598.00 - 6600.00] P:1638.30 E:0.105003 |  and they're into the final 20 seconds of normal time there.
[6600.00 - 6604.00] P:1734.40 E:0.096364 |  This second half started a little bit behind the England game,
[6604.00 - 6606.00] P:1646.14 E:0.099422 |  defending for USA to do.
[6606.00 - 6608.00] P:1658.52 E:0.091987 |  You couldn't get there before the cross comes in,
[6608.00 - 6610.00] P:1625.04 E:0.100943 |  but the ball is headed away by Shaquille Moore,
[6610.00 - 6613.00] P:1703.22 E:0.103425 |  and he takes no chances, and even though there was no opponent around him,
[6613.00 - 6616.00] P:1696.16 E:0.094717 |  he's headed it out to give a throw-in to Iran,
[6616.00 - 6619.00] P:1667.43 E:0.100121 |  and they are back underway again, and a chance to deliver it to the penalty area
[6619.00 - 6622.00] P:1746.54 E:0.097379 |  by poor Ali Janji, who's the centre half,
[6622.00 - 6624.00] P:1612.69 E:0.096261 |  who's playing up like a midfielder now,
[6624.00 - 6627.00] P:1738.58 E:0.092785 |  because Iran have got to throw the kitchen sink at this.
[6627.00 - 6629.00] P:1651.23 E:0.107030 |  Iran nil, United States 1.
[6629.00 - 6632.00] P:1733.56 E:0.099727 |  USA, who've had a couple of draws coming into this game.
[6632.00 - 6634.00] P:1693.88 E:0.092483 |  They've played well in their opening matches,
[6634.00 - 6635.00] P:1730.69 E:0.106538 |  struggled to score goals,
[6635.00 - 6638.00] P:1780.29 E:0.092764 |  pleased to have got that goal from Christian Pulisic in this one,
[6638.00 - 6642.00] P:1600.59 E:0.101940 |  but will it be enough, because USA have not looked like adding to the tally.
[6642.00 - 6646.00] P:1667.50 E:0.087063 |  Iran come in the attack with Jalal, down the left-hand side this time,
[6646.00 - 6648.00] P:1731.20 E:0.098318 |  and that's a good crunching tackle.
[6648.00 - 6650.00] P:1820.82 E:0.104915 |  Shaquille Moore attracts him all the way to the byline,
[6650.00 - 6654.00] P:1609.59 E:0.096721 |  and slides in, and the ball goes out of play out by the corner flag,
[6654.00 - 6657.00] P:1711.87 E:0.096558 |  but for a throw-in, a throw-in on the left-hand side,
[6657.00 - 6659.00] P:1621.79 E:0.098017 |  that four of that, it will remain on the...
[6659.00 - 6660.00] P:1602.02 E:0.105566 |  It's going to be a corner.
[6660.00 - 6663.00] P:1694.59 E:0.096261 |  It went down on the corner kick-side of the corner flag.
[6663.00 - 6667.00] P:1785.22 E:0.088576 |  Iranian fans, up on their feet, still supportive,
[6667.00 - 6669.00] P:1720.65 E:0.106423 |  still believing that the one goal could come here.
[6669.00 - 6671.00] P:1792.42 E:0.102594 |  This really feels like sudden-death football.
[6671.00 - 6674.00] P:1751.84 E:0.102134 |  Bulkums in Tim Reem dramatically fall to the ground.
[6674.00 - 6676.00] P:1692.23 E:0.089612 |  Referee spotted that, but waves play on,
[6676.00 - 6679.00] P:1728.67 E:0.096821 |  and possession will be cleared away up towards the halfway line,
[6679.00 - 6684.00] P:1688.95 E:0.098264 |  where Aronson with the bright yellow boots tries to skip away from two defenders,
[6684.00 - 6685.00] P:1535.04 E:0.096233 |  and the ball goes out of play,
[6685.00 - 6687.00] P:1657.11 E:0.096419 |  and that will be a throw-in to the United States,
[6687.00 - 6691.00] P:1757.00 E:0.102985 |  who are almost there two minutes of the regulation 90 to go.
[6691.00 - 6693.00] P:1540.31 E:0.099376 |  Back to the Wales England game, and John Murray.
[6693.00 - 6696.00] P:1656.54 E:0.082738 |  We're into the second of four minutes of added time.
[6696.00 - 6700.00] P:1754.17 E:0.090441 |  Wales Nill, England three, could easily have been a fourth for England.
[6700.00 - 6702.00] P:1616.00 E:0.099945 |  Ball played in from the right-hand side,
[6702.00 - 6704.00] P:1653.87 E:0.098027 |  Maguire headed it back across,
[6704.00 - 6707.00] P:1762.54 E:0.095681 |  and John Stones on the edge of the six-yard box put it over the bar,
[6707.00 - 6710.00] P:1739.73 E:0.085744 |  so still just three-nil to England.
[6710.00 - 6711.00] P:1858.72 E:0.104697 |  Thanks very much, John.
[6711.00 - 6714.00] P:1674.75 E:0.087921 |  Here it is, still on that knife edge.
[6714.00 - 6718.00] P:1500.56 E:0.093490 |  Iran Nill, USA won, so much talk in the build-up, the politics,
[6718.00 - 6720.00] P:1766.36 E:0.095044 |  the history between these two nations.
[6720.00 - 6723.00] P:1530.46 E:0.094592 |  They met at the 1998 World Cup.
[6723.00 - 6725.00] P:1648.10 E:0.098939 |  They don't meet often in other sports.
[6725.00 - 6728.00] P:1656.28 E:0.092512 |  They don't meet often in diplomatic circles.
[6728.00 - 6729.00] P:1651.28 E:0.088289 |  There is always a bit of an edge,
[6729.00 - 6733.00] P:1613.49 E:0.095975 |  and then you bring into the whole factor of things,
[6733.00 - 6736.00] P:1646.81 E:0.100418 |  the current situation that the anti-government protest in Iran at the moment,
[6736.00 - 6740.00] P:1682.91 E:0.099568 |  the scrutiny of players who looked uncomfortable singing the national anthem,
[6740.00 - 6742.00] P:1570.37 E:0.095127 |  but they did so in the build-up to this game,
[6742.00 - 6746.00] P:1664.09 E:0.093078 |  as the USA come again with Eunice Musa,
[6746.00 - 6748.00] P:1803.81 E:0.105001 |  who's only 20 years of age.
[6748.00 - 6751.00] P:1711.53 E:0.103988 |  He's birthday today, and he's at a storming performance in the midfield.
[6751.00 - 6753.00] P:1684.46 E:0.098208 |  This time he gives it away, ball over the top,
[6753.00 - 6756.00] P:1709.09 E:0.093828 |  but Taremi is way too far in front of the front-men.
[6756.00 - 6760.00] P:1553.28 E:0.098755 |  Taremi won't get there, and the pass from Taremi runs all the way through to Matt Turner,
[6760.00 - 6762.00] P:1769.98 E:0.103775 |  and the United States are almost there.
[6762.00 - 6765.00] P:1588.65 E:0.091774 |  The clock ticks on into the 90th minute now.
[6765.00 - 6769.00] P:1685.27 E:0.093560 |  We will find out shortly what is going to be added on for the stoppages,
[6769.00 - 6774.00] P:1627.48 E:0.093518 |  but this is a game in which Iran will feel they've never really got out of third-fourth gear.
[6774.00 - 6778.00] P:1624.33 E:0.099536 |  USA were dominant in terms of possession, and indeed territory in the first half.
[6778.00 - 6780.00] P:1764.26 E:0.089569 |  They had plenty of chances.
[6780.00 - 6782.00] P:1551.20 E:0.101532 |  They were delighted when the goal did come for Pulisik.
[6782.00 - 6785.00] P:1630.38 E:0.099078 |  It was a header back across the edge of the six-yard box.
[6785.00 - 6788.00] P:1606.21 E:0.107234 |  There's going to be nine minutes, nine minutes added on here.
[6788.00 - 6791.00] P:1671.51 E:0.101625 |  There is quite a way to go. There is time for Iran.
[6791.00 - 6794.00] P:1577.17 E:0.088731 |  The goal came from Des Heder back across the six-yard box.
[6794.00 - 6797.00] P:1667.30 E:0.098538 |  Pulisik bravely running in, beating the goalkeeper,
[6797.00 - 6801.00] P:1633.50 E:0.102842 |  getting it over the line, and then crunching in and hurting himself in the process.
[6801.00 - 6805.00] P:1694.49 E:0.099150 |  But that's the goal that could be about to send the United States through.
[6805.00 - 6808.00] P:1680.24 E:0.095331 |  England already on their way to that last 16,
[6808.00 - 6811.00] P:1667.24 E:0.105258 |  and the United States within a whisker of joining them, it would appear.
[6811.00 - 6814.00] P:1662.12 E:0.099310 |  They're almost done and dusted in the Wales England.
[6814.00 - 6816.00] P:1695.24 E:0.099061 |  Game England still three goals to the good.
[6816.00 - 6818.00] P:1569.44 E:0.099617 |  All the goals in the second half.
[6818.00 - 6821.00] P:1749.46 E:0.098311 |  Iran trying to muster some late drama here.
[6821.00 - 6824.00] P:1696.79 E:0.095132 |  Godos back in the midfield to Ezat Deloy.
[6824.00 - 6827.00] P:1739.96 E:0.098980 |  He gives a short pass to the right-hand side,
[6827.00 - 6832.00] P:1515.15 E:0.087993 |  and it's played up in front of Reis Elan on the right-hand side,
[6832.00 - 6833.00] P:1646.06 E:0.101821 |  but he can't find any way through.
[6833.00 - 6835.00] P:1802.58 E:0.105454 |  And the United States have still got energy in the boots.
[6835.00 - 6839.00] P:1740.55 E:0.097200 |  They're still petroling the tank as they sock oxygen into those lungs
[6839.00 - 6841.00] P:1762.67 E:0.107567 |  and close down the options.
[6841.00 - 6842.00] P:1678.16 E:0.080956 |  Chance to attack for Celali.
[6842.00 - 6845.00] P:1715.21 E:0.099612 |  Down the left-hand side, swings in across, and back there.
[6845.00 - 6847.00] P:1626.36 E:0.103561 |  Tim Reim is able to clear the wall all the way.
[6847.00 - 6852.00] P:1714.07 E:0.104026 |  Walter Zimidim, by the way, has also come on as a further defensive reinforcement
[6852.00 - 6855.00] P:1654.51 E:0.096864 |  for the United States of America, who lead by a goal to it.
[6855.00 - 6857.00] P:1666.57 E:0.105112 |  It stays like this, they're through.
[6857.00 - 6859.00] P:1690.90 E:0.096240 |  Iran just need one goal.
[6859.00 - 6862.00] P:1671.50 E:0.106713 |  Now they want to free-kick the Iranians on the edge of the penalty area,
[6862.00 - 6864.00] P:1720.47 E:0.100112 |  but the referee's not interested in the appeals,
[6864.00 - 6868.00] P:1610.32 E:0.108351 |  and the full-time whistle has gone in the Wales England game.
[6868.00 - 6869.00] P:1783.67 E:0.095542 |  Back to John Murray.
[6869.00 - 6870.00] P:1868.29 E:0.086520 |  It has finished.
[6870.00 - 6873.00] P:1731.22 E:0.097777 |  Wales nil, England three.
[6873.00 - 6876.00] P:1729.94 E:0.103351 |  Stodgy in the first half, but England turned it on in the second.
[6876.00 - 6878.00] P:1583.41 E:0.095558 |  Rashford scored two.
[6878.00 - 6882.00] P:1743.70 E:0.102336 |  Phil Foulden scored as well on his first start at a World Cup.
[6882.00 - 6884.00] P:1823.45 E:0.090357 |  There could have been more two.
[6884.00 - 6885.00] P:1795.27 E:0.089307 |  So that's it for Wales.
[6885.00 - 6888.00] P:1626.33 E:0.104976 |  This World Cup journey is over for them,
[6888.00 - 6891.00] P:1659.77 E:0.097058 |  and England go through as group winners.
[6891.00 - 6895.00] P:1683.97 E:0.097403 |  Garrel Southgate said their first objective in Qatar was to win the group.
[6895.00 - 6900.00] P:1687.17 E:0.097029 |  That's what they've done after a 3-0 win here at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.
[6900.00 - 6903.00] P:1690.96 E:0.100705 |  Almost 4-10, we'll have 6-06 coming up,
[6903.00 - 6908.00] P:1741.79 E:0.096353 |  but all the reaction with Mark Chapman wants the live game finishes here.
[6908.00 - 6910.00] P:1667.04 E:0.108128 |  Iran, USA, one nil to the United States,
[6910.00 - 6912.00] P:1847.66 E:0.092611 |  but a free-kick to the Iranians,
[6912.00 - 6915.00] P:1872.60 E:0.110716 |  and resident plays it in as a diving header just wide.
[6915.00 - 6919.00] P:1819.48 E:0.095517 |  Hands down the best chance that Iran have had in the game so far.
[6919.00 - 6922.00] P:1774.13 E:0.099788 |  It's the central defender for Ali Ghanji,
[6922.00 - 6926.00] P:1761.05 E:0.103753 |  and that was so agonisingly close for Iran.
[6926.00 - 6927.00] P:1732.13 E:0.086134 |  He's diving header.
[6927.00 - 6931.00] P:1690.92 E:0.107316 |  He's bravely throwing his head down where boots and shin guards are,
[6931.00 - 6934.00] P:1673.90 E:0.100461 |  and he puts it about a foot and a half wide.
[6934.00 - 6937.00] P:1759.81 E:0.101278 |  Matt Turner, the goalkeeper, diving to his right-hand side.
[6937.00 - 6940.00] P:1845.95 E:0.097493 |  So relieved to see that off target.
[6940.00 - 6944.00] P:1867.77 E:0.096323 |  Iran are not out of this yet.
[6944.00 - 6947.00] P:1866.84 E:0.099944 |  I've just seen a stat that says in the last 15 minutes,
[6947.00 - 6950.00] P:1787.68 E:0.097952 |  Iran have had over 85% possession.
[6950.00 - 6955.00] P:1640.30 E:0.089707 |  That is the late heat that they are putting on their opponents here,
[6955.00 - 6958.00] P:1721.19 E:0.098120 |  and the United States are struggling to contain them.
[6958.00 - 6960.00] P:1310.91 E:0.100361 |  Remember, we spoke about it earlier on,
[6960.00 - 6963.00] P:1741.75 E:0.099517 |  those late goals that the Iranians tend to muster up.
[6963.00 - 6967.00] P:1704.27 E:0.095679 |  Five of the last eight goals that they have scored in tournaments
[6967.00 - 6970.00] P:1662.04 E:0.106414 |  have come very, very late after the 90 minutes are up.
[6970.00 - 6973.00] P:1632.71 E:0.093920 |  Each of the last eight goals that Iran have scored in a work-up
[6973.00 - 6975.00] P:1656.57 E:0.092790 |  have been in the second half of games.
[6975.00 - 6978.00] P:1662.74 E:0.102444 |  They tend to get better as games go on,
[6978.00 - 6980.00] P:1621.76 E:0.095215 |  and the United States are looking at the clock,
[6980.00 - 6982.00] P:1753.79 E:0.098255 |  which is slowly ticking on,
[6982.00 - 6986.00] P:1723.02 E:0.097872 |  and we still have in excess of five minutes of stoppage time to play.
[6986.00 - 6989.00] P:1652.58 E:0.092343 |  Still 1-0 to the United States of America.
[6989.00 - 6994.00] P:1774.27 E:0.101049 |  This would be a huge victory for them if they can go through to the last 16.
[6994.00 - 6999.00] P:1638.22 E:0.092774 |  The ball is back with Berenva to suffer that concussion against England.
[6999.00 - 7002.00] P:1729.16 E:0.101567 |  The Iranian goalkeeper missed the Wales match as a result.
[7002.00 - 7004.00] P:1633.18 E:0.095519 |  Back in tonight though for Iran,
[7004.00 - 7007.00] P:1735.93 E:0.098424 |  and he clears the ball away and it goes out of play for a throw-in.
[7007.00 - 7009.00] P:1657.83 E:0.090540 |  And Robinson will take his time over this.
[7009.00 - 7012.00] P:1557.32 E:0.099536 |  Anthony Robinson, who's had a good game on the left side of the defence
[7012.00 - 7014.00] P:1729.21 E:0.092727 |  for the United States.
[7014.00 - 7016.00] P:1637.04 E:0.091265 |  He attempts a very long throw-in,
[7016.00 - 7019.00] P:1561.75 E:0.093635 |  trying to get it down to Shaquille Moore,
[7019.00 - 7021.00] P:1565.89 E:0.100750 |  and the ball goes out of play,
[7021.00 - 7023.00] P:1788.74 E:0.086400 |  and it'll be another throw-in to the United States,
[7023.00 - 7025.00] P:1574.62 E:0.103560 |  and they will of course take their time over this
[7025.00 - 7029.00] P:1706.19 E:0.094078 |  and try to add to some of the frustration that the Iranians are feeling now.
[7029.00 - 7030.00] P:1542.33 E:0.096773 |  Iran need a goal.
[7030.00 - 7032.00] P:1700.17 E:0.083826 |  In order to get that, they need possession.
[7032.00 - 7034.00] P:1565.07 E:0.100960 |  They get it back with Ryzean,
[7034.00 - 7036.00] P:1689.96 E:0.093636 |  that's a good pass down the right-hand side,
[7036.00 - 7039.00] P:1721.39 E:0.103519 |  and Gadas shows a clean pair of heels to get away from Adams,
[7039.00 - 7040.00] P:1718.91 E:0.081180 |  but he's run it out of play.
[7040.00 - 7041.00] P:1883.31 E:0.108712 |  Good acceleration,
[7041.00 - 7044.00] P:1684.49 E:0.092941 |  and I think you might have tweaked his cap sprinting out to that
[7044.00 - 7045.00] P:1511.89 E:0.090581 |  because he's hobbling now,
[7045.00 - 7047.00] P:1451.05 E:0.105082 |  but he ran away from Adams,
[7047.00 - 7048.00] P:1636.09 E:0.085381 |  but he ran the ball out of play,
[7048.00 - 7051.00] P:1727.24 E:0.103864 |  and the United States of America edge closer
[7051.00 - 7053.00] P:1685.10 E:0.095863 |  to what would be a famous victory.
[7053.00 - 7057.00] P:1712.95 E:0.092810 |  Their first of this World Cup in Qatar 2022.
[7057.00 - 7060.00] P:1719.67 E:0.101165 |  Gamesmanship from Tyler Adams, the United States captain,
[7060.00 - 7063.00] P:1680.69 E:0.097654 |  as he waits as much time as he can ahead of this throw-in.
[7063.00 - 7066.00] P:1665.95 E:0.097406 |  Now Anthony Robinson puts the ball up his shirt to wipe it,
[7066.00 - 7070.00] P:1702.45 E:0.094567 |  and again, add to the frustrations the Iranians are feeling.
[7070.00 - 7072.00] P:1634.08 E:0.091832 |  The throw-in from the left full-back position,
[7072.00 - 7074.00] P:1824.37 E:0.090499 |  up into midfield.
[7074.00 - 7076.00] P:1766.81 E:0.096196 |  Hadji Wright, the substitute, tries to control it.
[7076.00 - 7077.00] P:1708.95 E:0.098127 |  Harrison won't keep it in play.
[7077.00 - 7079.00] P:1729.79 E:0.093180 |  The ball is going out for a throw-in to Iran.
[7079.00 - 7081.00] P:1600.16 E:0.095756 |  They've got it back inside the American half,
[7081.00 - 7085.00] P:1825.84 E:0.092994 |  and there are still at least three minutes of stoppages to go.
[7085.00 - 7089.00] P:1705.01 E:0.091225 |  Here come Iran with Albu Fazz Jalalie on the left-hand side,
[7089.00 - 7092.00] P:1737.96 E:0.100278 |  runs in to the energetic Eunice Musa.
[7092.00 - 7093.00] P:1769.46 E:0.102204 |  That's very good from Musa,
[7093.00 - 7095.00] P:1759.36 E:0.097545 |  and then Jalalie's frustrated, and he bites back,
[7095.00 - 7097.00] P:1717.23 E:0.099678 |  and he's going to see yellow for that,
[7097.00 - 7100.00] P:1746.23 E:0.095980 |  and it's a free kick to the United States of America,
[7100.00 - 7103.00] P:1719.30 E:0.094165 |  and you can bet that they will take their time over this.
[7103.00 - 7107.00] P:1818.48 E:0.091468 |  The USA, who've had two draws coming into this third and deciding match,
[7107.00 - 7110.00] P:1697.73 E:0.091826 |  it was the group that was still technically all open.
[7110.00 - 7112.00] P:1742.45 E:0.102437 |  All four teams could have gone through tonight.
[7112.00 - 7114.00] P:1666.35 E:0.094322 |  Obviously Wales would have needed a miracle,
[7114.00 - 7115.00] P:1651.32 E:0.109292 |  and that hasn't happened,
[7115.00 - 7117.00] P:1538.28 E:0.094381 |  and they've been beaten by England by three goals,
[7117.00 - 7121.00] P:1630.68 E:0.100142 |  and they'll have more reaction to come very shortly here on Five Live to that.
[7121.00 - 7124.00] P:1656.81 E:0.104712 |  But this is the closing stages of Iran against the USA,
[7124.00 - 7126.00] P:1630.56 E:0.096247 |  and it is still there for Iran.
[7126.00 - 7128.00] P:1471.98 E:0.105269 |  There is still the hope,
[7128.00 - 7130.00] P:1662.96 E:0.095670 |  which will be agonising for them at the moment.
[7130.00 - 7133.00] P:1760.41 E:0.101751 |  Shaqeel Moore on the right-hand side has given the ball away.
[7133.00 - 7135.00] P:1650.57 E:0.102077 |  That's a really poor pass.
[7135.00 - 7137.00] P:1798.55 E:0.097742 |  Mohamedy goes long in searching.
[7137.00 - 7141.00] P:1642.34 E:0.089992 |  Acrobatic header by Tim Reem to get the ball away.
[7141.00 - 7143.00] P:1737.45 E:0.091941 |  Now the Americans have to sprint backwards again,
[7143.00 - 7145.00] P:1549.68 E:0.105044 |  as Iran pump it down the right-hand side,
[7145.00 - 7148.00] P:1797.21 E:0.096840 |  and Reem comes across and uses all his experience there.
[7148.00 - 7152.00] P:1702.72 E:0.097433 |  There's a little dummy knowing that the ball would go out for an American throw,
[7152.00 - 7155.00] P:1823.94 E:0.096211 |  and that just takes some of the simmer off the foil again,
[7155.00 - 7159.00] P:1661.02 E:0.099144 |  as the Iranians are beginning to dramatically run out of time now.
[7159.00 - 7162.00] P:1728.84 E:0.096913 |  By my clock, two minutes of stoppages to go.
[7162.00 - 7164.00] P:1537.70 E:0.097062 |  There may be a little bit more added arm.
[7164.00 - 7167.00] P:1715.40 E:0.093237 |  The Spanish referee does glance at his wristwatch,
[7167.00 - 7169.00] P:1764.92 E:0.099445 |  as Iran immediately regained possession,
[7169.00 - 7171.00] P:1654.03 E:0.100303 |  and USA, when they look back at this game,
[7171.00 - 7176.00] P:1716.37 E:0.094720 |  they'll be so disappointed at how they failed to retain the ball in this second period.
[7176.00 - 7179.00] P:1636.90 E:0.101371 |  They've had the one-goal lead, but they've not looked comfortable in it at all.
[7179.00 - 7181.00] P:1859.81 E:0.091963 |  Good lead by Walker Zimmerman to head the ball away.
[7181.00 - 7183.00] P:1783.67 E:0.102639 |  The USA playing with three centre-halves now.
[7183.00 - 7187.00] P:1633.36 E:0.097875 |  Reem, Carter Vickers, and Zimmerman, as they try to get it away,
[7187.00 - 7188.00] P:1701.96 E:0.104349 |  but they can't hold it up again.
[7188.00 - 7190.00] P:1806.25 E:0.098876 |  Everyone's on the attack for Iran.
[7190.00 - 7193.00] P:1675.44 E:0.098590 |  Carter Vickers inside the penalty area, puts a big right boot on it,
[7193.00 - 7196.00] P:1774.97 E:0.102212 |  and clears it away, but there's no enough field for the United States,
[7196.00 - 7200.00] P:1673.68 E:0.093279 |  and this will be Iran to attack once more down the left-hand side.
[7200.00 - 7203.00] P:1771.74 E:0.092099 |  But it's held up in quite heavy traffic there.
[7203.00 - 7206.00] P:1822.00 E:0.096879 |  It's all become very feisty in a scramble now.
[7206.00 - 7207.00] P:1721.50 E:0.089032 |  It's scrappy football.
[7207.00 - 7209.00] P:1801.00 E:0.097195 |  This is like something on the street,
[7209.00 - 7211.00] P:1649.79 E:0.102310 |  but that is how the Americans will like it at the moment,
[7211.00 - 7214.00] P:1673.36 E:0.095667 |  as the clock ticks on and we're now into the eighth minute.
[7214.00 - 7216.00] P:1681.52 E:0.079585 |  Nine to be added on.
[7216.00 - 7221.00] P:1786.14 E:0.101497 |  The Iranian goalkeeper, Peran van, comes as far out of his penalty area as he dares,
[7221.00 - 7223.00] P:1787.80 E:0.097739 |  lumps it forward high and hopeful.
[7223.00 - 7226.00] P:1727.63 E:0.099581 |  Good leap by Walker Zimmerman to clear it away.
[7226.00 - 7228.00] P:1767.15 E:0.088893 |  Had she right false to the ground,
[7228.00 - 7230.00] P:1760.85 E:0.101541 |  but can't control it for the United States of America.
[7230.00 - 7233.00] P:1769.55 E:0.094382 |  Possession is picked up by Jalalie on the left-hand side.
[7233.00 - 7235.00] P:1674.85 E:0.092868 |  Doesn't fancy pumping it in.
[7235.00 - 7236.00] P:1637.81 E:0.101429 |  Gives it back to the defender, Hosseini.
[7236.00 - 7237.00] P:1800.06 E:0.112462 |  Now he goes long.
[7237.00 - 7239.00] P:1748.27 E:0.102454 |  Then it's a victory, and a one.
[7239.00 - 7241.00] P:1879.90 E:0.103410 |  Mariah comes out, ball through his legs,
[7241.00 - 7242.00] P:1711.13 E:0.112275 |  and it's cleared away by Zimmerman.
[7242.00 - 7244.00] P:1832.76 E:0.106861 |  That was so close for Iran.
[7244.00 - 7247.00] P:1728.67 E:0.099236 |  The goalkeeper was not megged, but the ball had no pace,
[7247.00 - 7249.00] P:1771.10 E:0.109940 |  and it couldn't carry over the goal line.
[7249.00 - 7253.00] P:1735.37 E:0.105437 |  America regained possession, and it's cleared away by Western McKinney,
[7253.00 - 7256.00] P:1786.59 E:0.099039 |  and this is absolutely frantic now.
[7256.00 - 7258.00] P:1626.36 E:0.098322 |  We're about to go into the ninth minute.
[7258.00 - 7262.00] P:1770.55 E:0.102491 |  The Iranians are all making the rectangular gesture,
[7262.00 - 7264.00] P:1752.64 E:0.102248 |  and they want the officials to look at this,
[7264.00 - 7265.00] P:1756.06 E:0.103736 |  and they wanted to go to VAR.
[7265.00 - 7267.00] P:1816.86 E:0.102087 |  What do they think they've seen?
[7267.00 - 7268.00] P:1840.86 E:0.097216 |  The ball was flicked on.
[7268.00 - 7270.00] P:1870.55 E:0.095355 |  Out came the goalkeeper, not megged to his.
[7270.00 - 7273.00] P:1780.59 E:0.107221 |  I think they're trying to say that goalkeeper Matt Ryan
[7273.00 - 7278.00] P:1792.76 E:0.098232 |  commits a foul on poor Ali Gaddi, who's coming in,
[7278.00 - 7279.00] P:1595.39 E:0.092062 |  but I don't think...
[7279.00 - 7280.00] P:1830.81 E:0.097094 |  I think he's fallen his feet.
[7280.00 - 7282.00] P:1901.08 E:0.104910 |  He's already lost his balance.
[7282.00 - 7284.00] P:1773.99 E:0.097322 |  He's tried to collide into the goalkeeper.
[7284.00 - 7286.00] P:1774.79 E:0.110649 |  I'd be surprised if the video assistant referee
[7286.00 - 7288.00] P:1749.17 E:0.092860 |  wants to come and deem that to be a foul.
[7288.00 - 7290.00] P:1807.97 E:0.098898 |  The protester continued.
[7290.00 - 7293.00] P:1662.93 E:0.103278 |  It was Terame, who was the player who collided with the goalkeeper,
[7293.00 - 7296.00] P:1631.24 E:0.107383 |  and he's now leading right up into the goalkeeper's face.
[7296.00 - 7301.00] P:1769.89 E:0.095268 |  The case for the prosecution here to say that this might be a penalty.
[7301.00 - 7304.00] P:1815.25 E:0.102520 |  Could it be that Carter Vickers was pulling back his shoulder?
[7304.00 - 7306.00] P:1781.22 E:0.091376 |  If there is a touch, it's only a glancing one.
[7306.00 - 7308.00] P:1693.07 E:0.094618 |  The arm of the goalkeeper is on the...
[7308.00 - 7311.00] P:1764.75 E:0.100348 |  The defender is on the attacker's shoulder.
[7311.00 - 7313.00] P:1677.37 E:0.096486 |  But yes, the ball is back in play.
[7313.00 - 7316.00] P:1750.34 E:0.101107 |  There is no further review from the video assistant referee
[7316.00 - 7319.00] P:1727.95 E:0.104291 |  who has looked at it, but deem there is no case to answer.
[7319.00 - 7321.00] P:1647.19 E:0.093768 |  We're now into the 10th minute of stoppages.
[7321.00 - 7323.00] P:1755.83 E:0.099593 |  The ball is cleared away at the back
[7323.00 - 7326.00] P:1795.30 E:0.102594 |  for the United States of America by Western McKenney.
[7326.00 - 7329.00] P:1705.86 E:0.098355 |  Now, Iran have pushed everyone forward and they're thin at the back.
[7329.00 - 7331.00] P:1684.65 E:0.098476 |  As Aronson rolls an in-front of right.
[7331.00 - 7333.00] P:1881.65 E:0.103843 |  This could settle it, but he's exhausted right,
[7333.00 - 7336.00] P:1710.80 E:0.102306 |  and he falls over like a man with no energy left,
[7336.00 - 7339.00] P:1817.99 E:0.097417 |  and he's terrible cross, he's picked up by the goalkeeper,
[7339.00 - 7341.00] P:1687.97 E:0.099001 |  and Piran Van Pump it down.
[7341.00 - 7343.00] P:1650.28 E:0.108286 |  Iran need one goaler, they're out.
[7343.00 - 7345.00] P:1861.76 E:0.106367 |  USA hold on to this and they're through,
[7345.00 - 7348.00] P:1694.13 E:0.105218 |  along with England who've beaten Wales by three goals to nil.
[7348.00 - 7351.00] P:1800.96 E:0.101124 |  This is five-life and BBC sounds of the World Cup.
[7351.00 - 7353.00] P:1786.30 E:0.101541 |  We're into the 11th minute of stoppage time.
[7353.00 - 7355.00] P:1807.75 E:0.108939 |  Iran nil, USA won.
[7355.00 - 7357.00] P:1700.27 E:0.100622 |  The Iranians pump it into the penalty area.
[7357.00 - 7359.00] P:1873.81 E:0.102318 |  Walker zoom him in his back.
[7359.00 - 7362.00] P:1794.03 E:0.100541 |  He heads it away, and the full-time whistle blows,
[7362.00 - 7364.00] P:1822.69 E:0.102721 |  and both players fall to the ground
[7364.00 - 7368.00] P:1735.44 E:0.099199 |  like boxes at the end of 15 grueling rounds.
[7368.00 - 7372.00] P:1687.28 E:0.098374 |  There's barely a smile of celebration from the Americans on the pitch,
[7372.00 - 7374.00] P:1737.69 E:0.102298 |  because they've given it everything.
[7374.00 - 7377.00] P:1670.62 E:0.100462 |  The energy comes from the substitutes and the backroom staff
[7377.00 - 7380.00] P:1634.63 E:0.100589 |  who've run on from the technical area.
[7380.00 - 7382.00] P:1644.88 E:0.102282 |  The Iranians are down and out.
[7382.00 - 7384.00] P:1736.89 E:0.102983 |  In truth, they weren't good enough today.
[7384.00 - 7386.00] P:1580.78 E:0.095674 |  They didn't muster the attempts and target
[7386.00 - 7388.00] P:1750.22 E:0.099951 |  that might have troubled Matt Turner.
[7388.00 - 7391.00] P:1678.49 E:0.102679 |  But it is the United States who, unbeaten in the group,
[7391.00 - 7395.00] P:1632.99 E:0.102009 |  will make their way now into the last 16 of the World Cup.
[7395.00 - 7398.00] P:1676.55 E:0.103581 |  They gained revenge from 1998
[7398.00 - 7402.00] P:1575.55 E:0.100989 |  when in Leon the Americans were beaten by Iran.
[7402.00 - 7405.00] P:1607.89 E:0.100707 |  Iran's controversial World Cup is over,
[7405.00 - 7407.00] P:1741.28 E:0.103150 |  and it'll be interesting to see what stories will follow
[7407.00 - 7409.00] P:1556.54 E:0.101206 |  about homecomings from their players.
[7409.00 - 7412.00] P:1614.92 E:0.098718 |  But here and now, from a foot-falling point of view,
[7412.00 - 7414.00] P:1892.81 E:0.105840 |  this is USA's day.
[7414.00 - 7418.00] P:1721.33 E:0.100220 |  They have beaten Iran, and they go through to the last 16.
[7418.00 - 7420.00] P:1671.45 E:0.101270 |  Iran nil, USA won.
[7420.00 - 7422.00] P:1590.69 E:0.091373 |  Mark. That was breathless, Connor.
[7422.00 - 7423.00] P:1638.01 E:0.077900 |  Breatless.
[7423.00 - 7425.00] P:1737.90 E:0.089800 |  Breathing through the ears.
[7425.00 - 7430.00] P:1631.26 E:0.097662 |  Michael Richards, we've got it on in a monitor in the stadium
[7430.00 - 7433.00] P:1605.65 E:0.099165 |  where England are beaten Wales by three goals to nil.
[7433.00 - 7437.00] P:1806.25 E:0.088089 |  I don't think I've ever seen a game with qualification on the line,
[7437.00 - 7440.00] P:1727.33 E:0.095452 |  so where one team is going to celebrate and one team is going to lose,
[7440.00 - 7443.00] P:1720.06 E:0.094577 |  where both sets of players just fall to their knees at the end
[7443.00 - 7445.00] P:1629.05 E:0.096243 |  because they're exhausted.
[7445.00 - 7448.00] P:1603.53 E:0.082803 |  Absolutely brilliant scenes there.
[7448.00 - 7451.00] P:1562.12 E:0.102819 |  I think it was Moosa who was in picture at the time.
[7451.00 - 7454.00] P:1487.70 E:0.090362 |  It's been brilliant. It was brilliant against England again.
[7454.00 - 7456.00] P:1694.84 E:0.099861 |  But what a result for USA.
[7456.00 - 7457.00] P:1607.53 E:0.095348 |  They came here.
[7457.00 - 7459.00] P:1651.72 E:0.087662 |  A lot of people didn't give them a chance,
[7459.00 - 7462.00] P:1544.21 E:0.085658 |  but to get that win when it mattered the most,
[7462.00 - 7464.00] P:1727.78 E:0.081993 |  absolutely outstanding from USA.
[7464.00 - 7466.00] P:1460.05 E:0.101912 |  Chances rise at the end for Iran.
[7466.00 - 7469.00] P:1511.65 E:0.103376 |  There were claims for penalties as well,
[7469.00 - 7470.00] P:1584.99 E:0.119074 |  but the USA hold on.
[7470.00 - 7472.00] P:1685.47 E:0.086436 |  They finished second in the group.
[7472.00 - 7474.00] P:1518.13 E:0.094271 |  England have topped the group.
[7474.00 - 7476.00] P:1729.33 E:0.104727 |  They have to beat them Wales by three goals to nil.
[7476.00 - 7477.00] P:1786.74 E:0.100827 |  They've done finished third.
[7477.00 - 7479.00] P:1581.58 E:0.075443 |  Wales a bottom.
[7479.00 - 7482.00] P:1563.15 E:0.104616 |  England will now meet Senegal in the last 16.
[7482.00 - 7485.00] P:1607.91 E:0.070752 |  They beat Ecuador earlier today by two goals to one.
