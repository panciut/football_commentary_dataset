[0.00 - 7.32] P:1952.88 E:0.080073 |  Here we go then, the last 16 between Morocco and Spain.
[7.32 - 13.00] P:2137.28 E:0.114523 |  Morocco looking to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in their history.
[13.00 - 16.40] P:2123.22 E:0.111458 |  Spain, the winners of course in 2010.
[16.40 - 24.00] P:2106.90 E:0.107997 |  What Spain will we see this afternoon as the players stopped over on the far side,
[24.00 - 29.00] P:1985.59 E:0.096688 |  early free kick conceded by Hakim Ziesch of Morocco and Spain.
[29.00 - 32.00] P:1888.62 E:0.089252 |  We'll have a set piece, Jordi Arbour going down.
[32.00 - 36.00] P:1857.29 E:0.097914 |  A little bit excitable right at the start, I don't think he's particularly badly injured there,
[36.00 - 39.00] P:1829.75 E:0.098490 |  Ziesch reminding him that he was there.
[39.00 - 44.00] P:1929.25 E:0.109144 |  I don't think they've had a kick yet, have they? They may have had a header, they've not had a kick yet.
[44.00 - 46.00] P:2118.73 E:0.127799 |  But you expect that's going to be part of the game.
[46.00 - 50.00] P:2228.71 E:0.119722 |  These whistles and purges you hear there when Spain round the ball.
[50.00 - 54.00] P:2244.71 E:0.124012 |  They're going to have to have very strong throws because they're going to have to keep the halftrack for a while,
[54.00 - 56.00] P:2246.55 E:0.110259 |  because Spain will keep the ball.
[56.00 - 60.00] P:2227.86 E:0.117518 |  So here is Rodgerie in possession for Spain playing at centre half,
[60.00 - 62.00] P:2239.49 E:0.106012 |  as he has done throughout this tournament.
[62.00 - 67.00] P:2180.65 E:0.110409 |  And Spain now with La Porte just inside their own half, and we can take you through the line-up.
[67.00 - 72.00] P:2224.52 E:0.110203 |  So Morocco with Bono in goal, the back four of Hakimi,
[72.00 - 78.00] P:2004.29 E:0.107063 |  Aguierde of West Ham, Zais, the former Walsman and Mazraoui ahead of them.
[78.00 - 83.00] P:1820.24 E:0.107076 |  It's Anahi, Amrabat and Amala, Ziesch of Chelsea,
[83.00 - 87.00] P:1777.67 E:0.104759 |  Bouffal, formerly of Southampton and in the series, the Sevilla man,
[87.00 - 92.00] P:1663.96 E:0.105581 |  who plays his club football in Spain up front as the ball is out on the far side
[92.00 - 97.00] P:1916.38 E:0.100571 |  for a Spain throw, a little push there by Jordi Alba.
[97.00 - 100.00] P:1944.53 E:0.109044 |  After that Hakimi looks a bit nervous there.
[100.00 - 103.00] P:2003.51 E:0.110063 |  You know, considering he's played at a very salt level,
[103.00 - 108.00] P:1878.27 E:0.117178 |  he shouldn't be nervous there in the Southamberica Bowl he tried to play out the line.
[108.00 - 111.00] P:1821.82 E:0.119929 |  Referee Stoke again for some reason.
[111.00 - 115.00] P:1782.30 E:0.121044 |  I think he has got two players, Ziesch, very, very close to him.
[115.00 - 117.00] P:1809.22 E:0.117719 |  I don't think they can hit him.
[117.00 - 118.00] P:1758.81 E:0.118976 |  So low.
[118.00 - 120.00] P:1712.81 E:0.108567 |  Yeah, the noise inside the stadium.
[120.00 - 122.00] P:1749.87 E:0.112363 |  I think that's the afters of that little push by Jordi Alba,
[122.00 - 125.00] P:1882.17 E:0.110509 |  which Ziesch didn't react to whatsoever,
[125.00 - 131.00] P:2157.98 E:0.112376 |  but the referee coming over very quickly, Fernando Rappayini of Argentina
[131.00 - 134.00] P:2231.98 E:0.103038 |  and saying, no, none of that.
[134.00 - 138.00] P:2257.14 E:0.116341 |  And you can understand why in this cauldron of noise
[138.00 - 141.00] P:2293.35 E:0.113194 |  the official is wanting to get on top of things very quickly.
[141.00 - 145.00] P:2253.52 E:0.114970 |  I have to say, there was very little in it from Jordi Alba and Ziesch,
[145.00 - 148.00] P:2262.17 E:0.097219 |  but the official's aware.
[148.00 - 154.00] P:2210.61 E:0.110285 |  What a huge match this is in the noise inside Education City Stadium.
[154.00 - 155.00] P:2092.27 E:0.116114 |  Most of it for Morocco.
[155.00 - 159.00] P:2065.33 E:0.115685 |  That's why the whistles you can hear because Spain in position.
[159.00 - 164.00] P:1841.73 E:0.098679 |  And the big cheer as Ferran Torres is challenged by Sofiambu Falpol
[164.00 - 166.00] P:2078.06 E:0.101122 |  out of play for a Spain throw.
[166.00 - 169.00] P:2203.28 E:0.115131 |  Spain have Simone in goal, the back four of Llorente,
[169.00 - 171.00] P:2234.35 E:0.114595 |  Rodri, La Porte and Alba ahead of them.
[171.00 - 176.00] P:2205.56 E:0.108739 |  It's Gavi, Bousquets and Pedri, youth that experience intermingling
[176.00 - 180.00] P:2167.99 E:0.103094 |  in that Spain trio in midfield with Torres,
[180.00 - 182.00] P:2189.00 E:0.101636 |  the former Manchester City man,
[182.00 - 185.00] P:2176.69 E:0.100648 |  Almo and Asensio up front.
[185.00 - 189.00] P:2117.99 E:0.110710 |  Spain in position over on the far side, nil, nil.
[189.00 - 192.00] P:2127.23 E:0.119324 |  Three minutes played here on five live BBC sounds
[192.00 - 195.00] P:2197.33 E:0.110209 |  and across Africa on the BBC World Service.
[195.00 - 199.00] P:2256.28 E:0.105203 |  The left hand side comes Spain, very patient in position,
[199.00 - 204.00] P:2224.52 E:0.111442 |  but Morocco, well, one thing, and I'm loath to make predictions,
[204.00 - 208.00] P:2202.37 E:0.108788 |  but one thing that you would be surprised to see is Morocco panicking
[208.00 - 212.00] P:1965.24 E:0.113013 |  at any point in this match as the ball comes forward into the penalty area,
[212.00 - 215.00] P:1907.14 E:0.089079 |  cleared away by Ziesch, the big up and under.
[215.00 - 218.00] P:1946.96 E:0.097361 |  Spain will pick it back up just outside the penalty area,
[218.00 - 223.00] P:1783.00 E:0.099762 |  but it bounces off Asensio and Morocco will tidy up out to the right hand side
[223.00 - 227.00] P:1890.03 E:0.090244 |  and then Schraff, Hakimi, one of their star players,
[227.00 - 230.00] P:1870.77 E:0.116259 |  teammate of a couple of the Spain squad as well at PSG,
[230.00 - 234.00] P:2040.56 E:0.105504 |  Colour Soler and Palace Arabia, both on the bench for Spain today,
[234.00 - 241.00] P:2176.45 E:0.097534 |  but such a talented fallback over on that right hand side from Morocco.
[241.00 - 243.00] P:2147.40 E:0.117140 |  Spain in possession on the half-way line,
[243.00 - 248.00] P:2250.86 E:0.107500 |  but yes, Morocco's World Cup has been utterly marvellous.
[248.00 - 251.00] P:2174.14 E:0.108442 |  They finished top of their group, they drew with Croatia,
[251.00 - 255.00] P:2172.64 E:0.105430 |  they didn't concede, they beat Belgium, yes, Belgium have been disappointing,
[255.00 - 257.00] P:2095.53 E:0.122075 |  but didn't concede, as Pat mentioned earlier,
[257.00 - 259.00] P:2147.64 E:0.103469 |  the only goal that's gone in was against Canada,
[259.00 - 261.00] P:2057.80 E:0.106379 |  a match that they still won to top the group,
[261.00 - 263.00] P:2091.36 E:0.112213 |  Spain in possession still on the half-way line,
[263.00 - 265.00] P:2121.97 E:0.096268 |  it was one of those before the tournament, Pat.
[265.00 - 268.00] P:2175.86 E:0.109260 |  You'd think they'd be hard pressed to get out of the group,
[268.00 - 271.00] P:2200.99 E:0.101688 |  but now we're saying they're the ones that you'd really back
[271.00 - 274.00] P:2117.68 E:0.106830 |  if there's going to be an upset in the last 16, it could well be Morocco.
[274.00 - 278.00] P:1915.99 E:0.108939 |  Yeah, we actually just started with it, this game is incredible.
[278.00 - 281.00] P:1910.31 E:0.120228 |  They have tackled everything, and now they're getting their first break.
[281.00 - 283.00] P:1827.94 E:0.112968 |  And here they come down the right-hand side,
[283.00 - 287.00] P:1777.89 E:0.106071 |  it's the Chelsea man hacking Zee Esch, just overran it,
[287.00 - 291.00] P:1826.46 E:0.105507 |  poor touch, and the ball goes behind for a Spain goal kick, Mill Hill.
[291.00 - 294.00] P:1748.21 E:0.099978 |  Zee Esch tried to run outside as man.
[294.00 - 297.00] P:1708.06 E:0.110159 |  I don't think I've ever seen that from Zee Esch before,
[297.00 - 300.00] P:1754.66 E:0.110743 |  because he's so uncomfortable on his right foot,
[300.00 - 302.00] P:1792.77 E:0.115075 |  on that right hand side, he always comes back,
[302.00 - 304.00] P:1894.49 E:0.116911 |  comes into his left foot and tries to cross him down.
[304.00 - 307.00] P:1783.70 E:0.113470 |  That's the first chance of having to keep the ball, keep the ball at all.
[307.00 - 311.00] P:1828.33 E:0.115964 |  But what is, as I say, very noticeable, they are knacking into tackles.
[311.00 - 315.00] P:1946.96 E:0.112340 |  They are giving the Spanish no time at all, they're not letting them...
[315.00 - 319.00] P:2164.42 E:0.116802 |  If they come with the final touch and get close,
[319.00 - 321.00] P:2281.17 E:0.108514 |  every single Moroccan player is in there,
[321.00 - 324.00] P:2259.10 E:0.117670 |  they're definitely tackles, not getting half a yard.
[324.00 - 327.00] P:2124.83 E:0.112527 |  Here you go, Spain note down the right-hand side with Llorente,
[327.00 - 329.00] P:1753.66 E:0.112362 |  good sliding challenge from Roman Saís,
[329.00 - 332.00] P:1722.76 E:0.104469 |  and the ball takes a nick off, Marcos Llorente as well,
[332.00 - 336.00] P:1860.96 E:0.094793 |  and it will go out for Morocco, goal kick, Mill Hill.
[336.00 - 338.00] P:1727.83 E:0.094408 |  0-0, 5.5 minutes play.
[338.00 - 341.00] P:1577.58 E:0.098855 |  Yes, Zee Esch's participation in the World Cup,
[341.00 - 343.00] P:1566.15 E:0.095001 |  if you only go back four months or so,
[343.00 - 345.00] P:1630.79 E:0.096418 |  was very much in doubt.
[345.00 - 348.00] P:1517.31 E:0.099319 |  He'd fallen out with the previous manager, Vahid Halid Hodzic.
[348.00 - 350.00] P:1584.60 E:0.106529 |  He'd retired from international duty,
[350.00 - 352.00] P:1504.89 E:0.102618 |  quit the national side in February.
[352.00 - 356.00] P:1761.88 E:0.105014 |  But that is one of the many plus points you can say about the reign
[356.00 - 361.00] P:1652.55 E:0.098211 |  of Valid Regragi, the former Morocco defender,
[361.00 - 364.00] P:1812.49 E:0.103969 |  apart from tactics and how they've done at this World Cup,
[364.00 - 366.00] P:1799.14 E:0.105919 |  bringing players back into the national fold
[366.00 - 370.00] P:1825.15 E:0.087303 |  that had fallen out with Halid Hodzic and Zee Esch,
[370.00 - 372.00] P:1752.70 E:0.105784 |  foremost amongst those.
[372.00 - 374.00] P:1774.46 E:0.105863 |  Here come Morocco, down the left-hand side,
[374.00 - 376.00] P:1833.76 E:0.115514 |  Sophie and Bilfau goes down,
[376.00 - 379.00] P:2014.45 E:0.107456 |  there's nothing really in that, and Spain will clear away.
[379.00 - 381.00] P:1991.24 E:0.102134 |  They won't keep position, though,
[381.00 - 384.00] P:1861.09 E:0.092236 |  and it will be a throw to Morocco, which they take quickly.
[384.00 - 386.00] P:1611.38 E:0.110394 |  Left-hand side, midway through the Spain half,
[386.00 - 389.00] P:1651.05 E:0.098318 |  but they'll go all the way back to Roman Saís,
[389.00 - 393.00] P:1521.69 E:0.085341 |  who will square it to his centre-half partner,
[393.00 - 398.00] P:1584.06 E:0.099180 |  Naif Aguard, who will be appearances for West Ham this season.
[398.00 - 400.00] P:1706.46 E:0.105529 |  He was another one for different reasons,
[400.00 - 403.00] P:1888.02 E:0.093999 |  whose participation was in doubt,
[403.00 - 405.00] P:2042.99 E:0.109725 |  missed most of the season with an ankle injury,
[405.00 - 407.00] P:2126.47 E:0.098905 |  came back at the end of October,
[407.00 - 411.00] P:2025.46 E:0.098340 |  but those two Saís and Aguard very much the heart
[411.00 - 415.00] P:2036.26 E:0.092719 |  of that Moroccan solid defence of Spain have it,
[415.00 - 417.00] P:1886.32 E:0.109122 |  just inside their own heart, goblets.
[417.00 - 419.00] P:1818.04 E:0.109891 |  I know, it suggests the heart-heart as well.
[419.00 - 421.00] P:1899.57 E:0.117834 |  They put in the tackle, it's very interesting,
[421.00 - 424.00] P:1801.28 E:0.109012 |  they had a goal-kick, Morocco there,
[424.00 - 426.00] P:1876.85 E:0.109223 |  they've actually worked on their goal-kicks
[426.00 - 428.00] P:1833.54 E:0.107930 |  for a long ball to the left-hand side,
[428.00 - 430.00] P:1809.05 E:0.105411 |  they've got three players up for it,
[430.00 - 431.00] P:1941.52 E:0.090942 |  and they won it there.
[431.00 - 434.00] P:1870.06 E:0.113152 |  Now, I think they were almost preparing for Aspelikweta,
[434.00 - 436.00] P:2032.39 E:0.105624 |  with the lack of height to be there,
[436.00 - 437.00] P:1990.97 E:0.120228 |  but they still got the knock-on,
[437.00 - 440.00] P:2157.12 E:0.110499 |  and it shows you that they work on every part of the game,
[440.00 - 442.00] P:2235.78 E:0.110943 |  even their goal-kicks.
[443.00 - 446.00] P:2232.55 E:0.115530 |  So, Spain in position in the centre-circle,
[446.00 - 448.00] P:2247.56 E:0.119058 |  and Ramon did that, you can watch this match
[448.00 - 450.00] P:2343.42 E:0.115761 |  with our commentary on the BBC iPlayer,
[450.00 - 453.00] P:2289.52 E:0.107401 |  if you would like to, just search for World Cup Extra,
[453.00 - 455.00] P:2209.92 E:0.102836 |  and you'll find the feed that is synced up
[455.00 - 459.00] P:2333.92 E:0.106285 |  with our five-live commentary with your pictures,
[459.00 - 464.00] P:2200.55 E:0.101848 |  as the ball is with Gavi, just inside the Morocco half.
[464.00 - 466.00] P:2230.27 E:0.106173 |  Spain work it now to Pedring,
[466.00 - 468.00] P:2227.15 E:0.098883 |  it's all very neat and tidy,
[468.00 - 471.00] P:2192.40 E:0.093024 |  but Morocco in good shape.
[471.00 - 476.00] P:2233.11 E:0.108210 |  Spain trying to thread the ball through that red wall,
[476.00 - 480.00] P:2364.50 E:0.105740 |  those banks of five and four,
[480.00 - 482.00] P:2248.78 E:0.102985 |  as they work it out to this right-hand side.
[482.00 - 484.00] P:2187.88 E:0.111054 |  And here is Ferran Torres,
[484.00 - 485.00] P:2106.95 E:0.101679 |  who's a manches to City Man,
[485.00 - 487.00] P:2046.65 E:0.116886 |  lovely footwork into the penalty area,
[487.00 - 489.00] P:1973.92 E:0.109726 |  and tried the cute little back heel,
[489.00 - 494.00] P:1854.67 E:0.106231 |  and Spain will concede the free-kick inside the Morocco penalty area,
[494.00 - 496.00] P:1624.23 E:0.099444 |  Sofiane Amrabat going down,
[496.00 - 498.00] P:1476.60 E:0.086535 |  but that was nice from Torres.
[498.00 - 501.00] P:1669.35 E:0.096430 |  It was Brita Wall, he walks in there,
[501.00 - 503.00] P:1498.59 E:0.097526 |  and there's a red wall in front of him.
[503.00 - 506.00] P:1797.66 E:0.088032 |  As I say, if you get into the dangerous positions,
[506.00 - 508.00] P:1702.52 E:0.097372 |  they will close you down, but not one, not two.
[508.00 - 510.00] P:1753.01 E:0.097311 |  It's something three, something four.
[510.00 - 512.00] P:1733.20 E:0.107579 |  He's very, very little space out,
[512.00 - 513.00] P:1675.08 E:0.110669 |  so he did one little trick,
[513.00 - 514.00] P:1825.25 E:0.090717 |  but he needs more than one,
[514.00 - 517.00] P:1660.95 E:0.114884 |  he needs about three or four in the row there.
[517.00 - 520.00] P:1788.13 E:0.105232 |  I think there is one weakness that can begin
[520.00 - 522.00] P:1748.43 E:0.109991 |  to see one possible weakness
[522.00 - 525.00] P:1996.26 E:0.098229 |  in that back line of the Moroccans.
[525.00 - 527.00] P:2272.20 E:0.101849 |  When they hold the line,
[527.00 - 529.00] P:2289.90 E:0.115600 |  it is about 20 yards outside the 18-yard line,
[529.00 - 531.00] P:2236.98 E:0.103367 |  there's a gap there.
[531.00 - 533.00] P:2255.01 E:0.116695 |  If you had an Iniesta plane,
[533.00 - 534.00] P:2304.78 E:0.111483 |  I would be worried sick.
[534.00 - 536.00] P:2322.41 E:0.107961 |  They've not gotten an Iniesta plane,
[536.00 - 537.00] P:2243.21 E:0.108123 |  but they've got two players,
[537.00 - 538.00] P:2364.09 E:0.118724 |  so you never know,
[538.00 - 540.00] P:2306.41 E:0.115112 |  that ball just over the top
[540.00 - 543.00] P:2242.29 E:0.101306 |  may well be on for Spain at one point.
[543.00 - 546.00] P:2140.89 E:0.111838 |  Spain in position with the port up to the left-hand side now,
[546.00 - 549.00] P:2112.79 E:0.103351 |  but ball over the top doesn't count as going long, does it?
[549.00 - 550.00] P:1853.25 E:0.140920 |  No, but I'm not the way here to play it,
[550.00 - 554.00] P:2190.16 E:0.108104 |  not because it'll be from inside the opponent's heart.
[554.00 - 556.00] P:2201.38 E:0.123608 |  Just every now and again someone makes a run
[556.00 - 557.00] P:2223.74 E:0.116906 |  that may be fair in Torres,
[557.00 - 558.00] P:2322.47 E:0.098338 |  sometimes it's almost,
[558.00 - 561.00] P:2225.28 E:0.113602 |  but they're taking turns to make a little zippy run,
[561.00 - 564.00] P:2188.61 E:0.104281 |  just needing one of them right.
[564.00 - 566.00] P:2076.11 E:0.111432 |  Spain in possession,
[566.00 - 567.00] P:2071.08 E:0.090848 |  out to the left-hand side they go,
[567.00 - 568.00] P:2014.76 E:0.107795 |  and Jordi Alba,
[568.00 - 570.00] P:2098.25 E:0.107859 |  Tani Alba may have made the run,
[570.00 - 572.00] P:1896.12 E:0.108573 |  but Alba got some field instead,
[572.00 - 573.00] P:1702.59 E:0.105070 |  towards a sense he owns,
[573.00 - 576.00] P:1893.29 E:0.098786 |  very well dispossessed by Sophie and Amrabat,
[576.00 - 577.00] P:1670.59 E:0.110715 |  all the way back to Bono,
[577.00 - 580.00] P:1820.22 E:0.094572 |  who clears long over halfway line,
[580.00 - 582.00] P:1807.96 E:0.100657 |  looking for, in the series,
[582.00 - 584.00] P:1822.97 E:0.093452 |  the tall Moroccan centre forward.
[584.00 - 585.00] P:1872.79 E:0.096636 |  It's cleared away by Spain,
[585.00 - 588.00] P:1752.92 E:0.106464 |  in the series who did score.
[588.00 - 590.00] P:1795.31 E:0.108688 |  Coming off the bench the last time these sides met
[590.00 - 591.00] P:1872.67 E:0.115937 |  at the World Cup in 2018,
[591.00 - 594.00] P:1813.70 E:0.116783 |  that finishes a two-wheel draw very late,
[594.00 - 595.00] P:1954.10 E:0.111024 |  equaliser for Spain,
[595.00 - 598.00] P:1937.88 E:0.108972 |  and the wals around the stadium,
[598.00 - 602.00] P:1892.19 E:0.098029 |  because Spain have conceded a free kick,
[602.00 - 604.00] P:1739.28 E:0.113030 |  just outside their own penalty area,
[604.00 - 607.00] P:1761.14 E:0.106475 |  good driving run by Sofiane Bufal.
[607.00 - 608.00] P:1602.98 E:0.108231 |  Spain aren't happy with the decision,
[608.00 - 611.00] P:1637.42 E:0.109716 |  but Rocco with a set piece in a very good position here.
[611.00 - 614.00] P:1926.21 E:0.098928 |  Eh, I think Spain should have got free kick before it.
[614.00 - 618.00] P:1903.49 E:0.099511 |  B, 100% convinced her to have fell on the first,
[618.00 - 620.00] P:1880.88 E:0.105413 |  but I think he's fallen down, he's slacked already.
[620.00 - 622.00] P:1905.75 E:0.103967 |  However, they've got a free kick,
[622.00 - 624.00] P:1847.89 E:0.115058 |  it's about 30 yards out,
[624.00 - 626.00] P:1908.80 E:0.097860 |  and they're very fortunate to get it,
[626.00 - 627.00] P:1911.93 E:0.078962 |  but if they score here,
[627.00 - 632.00] P:1821.28 E:0.097742 |  the Spain's scores will be furious for the referee.
[632.00 - 636.00] P:1762.48 E:0.105232 |  Yeah, Pat's called it, very, very soft indeed.
[636.00 - 639.00] P:1677.23 E:0.105092 |  They were furious at the award,
[639.00 - 641.00] P:1675.89 E:0.078042 |  and as Pat rightly points out,
[641.00 - 644.00] P:1717.06 E:0.101643 |  they will be even more furious
[644.00 - 648.00] P:1630.06 E:0.087246 |  if they end up conceding from this set piece.
[648.00 - 651.00] P:1664.21 E:0.096623 |  So, Rocco, the two players over this,
[651.00 - 654.00] P:1695.88 E:0.082309 |  one of them is Astraf Hakimi,
[654.00 - 659.00] P:1763.72 E:0.080995 |  the other is Hakim Ziesh.
[659.00 - 662.00] P:1696.24 E:0.094276 |  Spain, with the players in the light blue shirts,
[662.00 - 665.00] P:1639.77 E:0.108329 |  lined up just inside their own penalty area,
[665.00 - 667.00] P:1661.44 E:0.119513 |  0-0 here, 11 minutes gone,
[667.00 - 670.00] P:1767.10 E:0.109035 |  will be Hakimi, and it's just over the bar.
[670.00 - 673.00] P:1945.52 E:0.096696 |  I think Simon have it covered, you know,
[673.00 - 675.00] P:1952.31 E:0.099928 |  good power in it, it's a good distance out,
[675.00 - 678.00] P:1832.48 E:0.104305 |  but with that sort of wall, there was four in the wall,
[678.00 - 680.00] P:1950.12 E:0.089169 |  it's going to have to be absolutely perfect.
[680.00 - 683.00] P:1989.11 E:0.109059 |  Noticeable, the Spanish do not play a player
[683.00 - 686.00] P:2146.42 E:0.106827 |  line during the carpet at the back,
[686.00 - 689.00] P:2214.42 E:0.115414 |  so I think they all have noticed that,
[689.00 - 692.00] P:2281.75 E:0.110243 |  Rocco, I think Ziesh will have noticed it,
[692.00 - 694.00] P:2276.45 E:0.112456 |  the entire wall jumped,
[694.00 - 696.00] P:2263.46 E:0.119931 |  and there was a gap underneath,
[696.00 - 698.00] P:2261.35 E:0.107426 |  so if they get another free kick.
[698.00 - 701.00] P:2106.26 E:0.112996 |  Yeah, good spot pattern, no draft excluder.
[701.00 - 703.00] P:2036.68 E:0.111862 |  Spain come down the left-hand side,
[703.00 - 704.00] P:2003.57 E:0.110316 |  ball into the penalty area,
[704.00 - 705.00] P:1869.27 E:0.111417 |  it's over the head of Asensio,
[705.00 - 708.00] P:1867.09 E:0.090774 |  by the head of Roman Ziesh,
[708.00 - 710.00] P:1695.84 E:0.112353 |  and up towards halfway, go Rocco,
[710.00 - 713.00] P:2226.52 E:0.089590 |  but Biscuits gets the foot in,
[713.00 - 715.00] P:2141.06 E:0.113660 |  and Spain will work it out to the left-hand side
[715.00 - 716.00] P:2232.37 E:0.115930 |  with Giuliava,
[716.00 - 719.00] P:2019.66 E:0.099373 |  his ball in towards Staniomo is too short,
[719.00 - 721.00] P:1823.74 E:0.105572 |  and Rocco again with the interception,
[721.00 - 722.00] P:1568.14 E:0.100141 |  all the way back to Bono,
[722.00 - 724.00] P:1682.58 E:0.114259 |  who's close down inside his own penalty area,
[724.00 - 726.00] P:1729.55 E:0.105298 |  taking a bit of a chance there,
[726.00 - 727.00] P:1649.31 E:0.117746 |  and he's it out in the end,
[727.00 - 728.00] P:1690.22 E:0.112034 |  very calm, he's a Saiz,
[728.00 - 729.00] P:1772.24 E:0.112134 |  it's one of those that,
[729.00 - 730.00] P:1824.13 E:0.101054 |  if that works out,
[730.00 - 733.00] P:1721.18 E:0.111282 |  then brilliantly, calmly done by Rocco,
[733.00 - 735.00] P:1697.28 E:0.109285 |  as Maserari wins the throw as well,
[735.00 - 736.00] P:1837.01 E:0.079745 |  but if it doesn't,
[736.00 - 738.00] P:1637.61 E:0.103457 |  we're all looking at the goalkeeper saying,
[738.00 - 740.00] P:1464.15 E:0.095955 |  what on earth are you doing?
[740.00 - 743.00] P:1686.58 E:0.099134 |  It is a sweet thing, if it does work out,
[743.00 - 746.00] P:1792.07 E:0.100354 |  but what a chance he takes there,
[746.00 - 747.00] P:1714.22 E:0.104661 |  that's extraordinary,
[747.00 - 749.00] P:1744.04 E:0.119045 |  with the Spanish players around him,
[749.00 - 751.00] P:1773.14 E:0.100891 |  and he's trying little tricks and dummies,
[751.00 - 753.00] P:1611.98 E:0.121479 |  and he's on little sex yardling,
[753.00 - 754.00] P:1587.98 E:0.123495 |  not intelligent to do that,
[754.00 - 756.00] P:1941.80 E:0.091128 |  you know, it's suggested.
[756.00 - 757.00] P:1896.66 E:0.102987 |  Free kick to Rocco,
[757.00 - 759.00] P:1351.52 E:0.114006 |  it's swung over to the right-hand side
[759.00 - 760.00] P:1405.50 E:0.105256 |  by Sofiane Bufels,
[760.00 - 761.00] P:1551.89 E:0.109402 |  yes, she wins the head of it,
[761.00 - 763.00] P:1712.96 E:0.097721 |  sends it back into the Morocco half,
[763.00 - 765.00] P:1665.38 E:0.100758 |  looking for a red shirt,
[765.00 - 766.00] P:1407.02 E:0.089565 |  it's collected by Amrabat,
[766.00 - 769.00] P:1861.56 E:0.101398 |  he goes down and wins the free kick,
[769.00 - 772.00] P:1706.50 E:0.104166 |  as Bono watches on inside his own penalty area,
[772.00 - 775.00] P:1580.86 E:0.092532 |  he's had a bit of a mixed tournament so far,
[775.00 - 777.00] P:1367.21 E:0.118915 |  Bono, he's the number one for Sevilla,
[777.00 - 778.00] P:1654.46 E:0.104080 |  so another one that plays
[778.00 - 779.00] P:1576.07 E:0.090097 |  his club football in Spain,
[779.00 - 781.00] P:1570.76 E:0.106552 |  so they two starts here,
[781.00 - 783.00] P:1436.69 E:0.107553 |  pulled out just before kick-off against Belgium,
[783.00 - 784.00] P:1439.48 E:0.106061 |  because he wasn't feeling well,
[784.00 - 786.00] P:1666.59 E:0.111463 |  had a really good match against Croatia
[786.00 - 787.00] P:1683.32 E:0.108672 |  in the nil-nil draw,
[787.00 - 790.00] P:1524.77 E:0.106610 |  but some nervy moments against Canada,
[790.00 - 792.00] P:1780.33 E:0.106533 |  and there were shades of that,
[792.00 - 795.00] P:1986.50 E:0.109029 |  as he played the ball out of his own penalty area
[795.00 - 796.00] P:1774.02 E:0.103642 |  a couple of moments ago,
[796.00 - 797.00] P:1670.68 E:0.114364 |  Morocco in position,
[797.00 - 801.00] P:1894.52 E:0.084662 |  just inside the Morocco half,
[801.00 - 803.00] P:1697.31 E:0.100165 |  and it's out to the right-hand side,
[803.00 - 806.00] P:1727.34 E:0.080917 |  and yes, they work it all the way back
[806.00 - 808.00] P:1575.75 E:0.090080 |  to just outside their own penalty area,
[808.00 - 809.00] P:1802.62 E:0.085431 |  and a get of West Ham.
[809.00 - 811.00] P:1756.91 E:0.090921 |  Well, nearly got to 15 minutes without,
[811.00 - 812.00] P:1767.28 E:0.098540 |  there wasn't a go,
[812.00 - 814.00] P:1821.99 E:0.084408 |  too many chances in the Moroccans,
[814.00 - 816.00] P:1789.76 E:0.104257 |  and you can see there's a little adaptation,
[816.00 - 818.00] P:1786.80 E:0.098891 |  a little change in the style of the game now,
[818.00 - 820.00] P:1867.31 E:0.106449 |  beforehand they were sitting in those banks
[820.00 - 822.00] P:1807.81 E:0.089073 |  that you perfectly described,
[822.00 - 825.00] P:1804.81 E:0.094074 |  and just allowing the possession for the Spanish,
[825.00 - 826.00] P:1828.12 E:0.086509 |  it's not happening now,
[826.00 - 828.00] P:1634.39 E:0.110813 |  look, they've opened the game up now,
[828.00 - 829.00] P:1784.59 E:0.088640 |  and they've widened the game up,
[829.00 - 830.00] P:1605.64 E:0.116592 |  as if to say,
[830.00 - 832.00] P:1887.58 E:0.096183 |  okay, we're here now, we're going to play.
[833.00 - 836.00] P:1750.16 E:0.102793 |  They're in possession over on the far side,
[836.00 - 840.00] P:1585.47 E:0.097770 |  one element of Morocco that hasn't led up at all,
[840.00 - 842.00] P:1651.96 E:0.109089 |  the fans behind the goal away to our right,
[842.00 - 844.00] P:1745.29 E:0.112449 |  banging the drums, waving the flags,
[844.00 - 847.00] P:1690.59 E:0.101017 |  they believe, as Masrari comes down the left-hand side,
[847.00 - 848.00] P:1590.20 E:0.107319 |  down to the bar line,
[848.00 - 849.00] P:1674.07 E:0.114300 |  digs the ball across,
[849.00 - 851.00] P:1772.93 E:0.108249 |  and Seymour takes that very well,
[851.00 - 853.00] P:1872.96 E:0.110621 |  on the edge of his six-yard box,
[853.00 - 854.00] P:1850.68 E:0.088629 |  under pressure too.
[855.00 - 856.00] P:1947.31 E:0.106293 |  Yeah, I mean,
[856.00 - 857.00] P:2005.74 E:0.105393 |  and good understanding,
[857.00 - 858.00] P:1876.48 E:0.101029 |  doing the left-hand side,
[858.00 - 859.00] P:1829.69 E:0.105779 |  they've looked very good from the start,
[859.00 - 861.00] P:1852.79 E:0.110434 |  it's not a good ball in the sedution,
[861.00 - 864.00] P:1933.19 E:0.106643 |  Masrari, we can do much better than that,
[864.00 - 865.00] P:1979.73 E:0.094012 |  but Hamon Bifal,
[865.00 - 866.00] P:1872.13 E:0.111929 |  they look at this,
[866.00 - 868.00] P:1887.57 E:0.116006 |  they've got a very, very good understanding,
[868.00 - 869.00] P:1795.16 E:0.113373 |  they're both really good players,
[869.00 - 871.00] P:1872.88 E:0.102635 |  but sometimes you can have that,
[871.00 - 872.00] P:1676.31 E:0.111595 |  and they don't work together,
[872.00 - 874.00] P:1693.08 E:0.098953 |  they want to work together,
[874.00 - 875.00] P:1758.69 E:0.107337 |  and I always like to go back
[875.00 - 877.00] P:1864.46 E:0.091741 |  and win wingers' partnerships,
[877.00 - 878.00] P:1887.34 E:0.108367 |  but very good sometimes.
[880.00 - 881.00] P:2080.10 E:0.106300 |  Spain in possession,
[881.00 - 882.00] P:2054.71 E:0.113036 |  just inside the run-off,
[882.00 - 884.00] P:2174.71 E:0.107078 |  what was your favourite one then, Pat?
[884.00 - 886.00] P:2188.87 E:0.107699 |  Well, I saw the Scottish manager,
[886.00 - 889.00] P:2011.14 E:0.095781 |  Steibie Clark wasn't bad to work with,
[889.00 - 891.00] P:2009.85 E:0.097429 |  but there have been many before I offend anyone.
[891.00 - 893.00] P:2286.62 E:0.097791 |  Hello, Seibik, are you listening?
[893.00 - 895.00] P:2198.75 E:0.089731 |  Spain in possession,
[895.00 - 896.00] P:2175.32 E:0.114589 |  just inside their own half.
[896.00 - 898.00] P:2240.50 E:0.114495 |  Nil Nil, 15 minutes gone
[898.00 - 899.00] P:2366.98 E:0.112607 |  on five live BBC sounds
[899.00 - 900.00] P:2208.45 E:0.107511 |  and a cross-apricot
[900.00 - 902.00] P:2201.29 E:0.113846 |  on the BBC World Service.
[902.00 - 905.00] P:2260.02 E:0.109422 |  Morocco in the last 16,
[905.00 - 907.00] P:2153.65 E:0.101785 |  for the second time in their history,
[907.00 - 909.00] P:2208.07 E:0.105612 |  the first time for 36 years,
[909.00 - 912.00] P:2252.24 E:0.110223 |  they have never got further than this stage,
[912.00 - 913.00] P:2251.05 E:0.093869 |  but then Nil Nil is Spain
[913.00 - 916.00] P:2191.21 E:0.103592 |  after what has been an outstanding world cup
[916.00 - 919.00] P:2122.89 E:0.102596 |  for Wali's Regragris side.
[919.00 - 922.00] P:2261.64 E:0.103959 |  And the Spain in possession just inside the Morocco half
[922.00 - 925.00] P:2254.09 E:0.101237 |  just passing along that back four.
[925.00 - 926.00] P:2351.02 E:0.103810 |  Again, it's remarkable to think that.
[926.00 - 929.00] P:2165.75 E:0.102993 |  He's only been in charge since the end of August.
[929.00 - 932.00] P:2270.18 E:0.110011 |  And to get by, and that's not easy,
[932.00 - 934.00] P:2237.68 E:0.098982 |  but sometimes it's a simple thing
[934.00 - 936.00] P:2156.64 E:0.113645 |  that you can win it by bringing
[936.00 - 937.00] P:2197.83 E:0.124803 |  our favourite player back
[937.00 - 938.00] P:2304.97 E:0.112929 |  come to his much love,
[938.00 - 940.00] P:2179.38 E:0.111916 |  then he's done that with Z.
[940.00 - 944.00] P:2121.02 E:0.106011 |  Spain building down the left-hand side,
[944.00 - 946.00] P:2119.55 E:0.122922 |  depending on who's there now to do
[946.00 - 948.00] P:1952.34 E:0.098780 |  and does manage to do it.
[948.00 - 950.00] P:1908.59 E:0.103781 |  Anu Nahi between them,
[950.00 - 953.00] P:1693.93 E:0.086852 |  throw goes out and goes Spain's way.
[953.00 - 955.00] P:2017.07 E:0.084338 |  Goal is here, that education city
[955.00 - 956.00] P:2033.66 E:0.102000 |  staying in the Spain,
[956.00 - 958.00] P:2089.65 E:0.104709 |  knocking back into the centre circle
[958.00 - 960.00] P:2223.20 E:0.105459 |  and the rotary of Manchester City
[960.00 - 962.00] P:2105.86 E:0.104156 |  now worked out to the former City Man
[962.00 - 963.00] P:2140.34 E:0.116134 |  Ferran Torres,
[963.00 - 965.00] P:2022.91 E:0.102542 |  whips the ball to the edge of the area,
[965.00 - 966.00] P:1682.68 E:0.119052 |  it's cleared away by Morocco
[966.00 - 968.00] P:1981.86 E:0.077892 |  and they'll control as well
[968.00 - 970.00] P:1682.03 E:0.088945 |  and play it back to Sophie and Amra.
[970.00 - 972.00] P:1712.44 E:0.106064 |  But again, they're happy to play around
[972.00 - 973.00] P:1618.70 E:0.115883 |  in the road penalty area in Morocco.
[973.00 - 975.00] P:1644.54 E:0.096437 |  That's a little bit more safety first.
[975.00 - 977.00] P:1665.28 E:0.103877 |  Still very good distribution from Borne,
[977.00 - 979.00] P:1827.42 E:0.088635 |  but Altsi Masrari, the left back,
[979.00 - 980.00] P:1730.80 E:0.119716 |  Zaheese then lifting it forward,
[980.00 - 982.00] P:1866.28 E:0.102711 |  a little too casual there ahead of Masrari
[982.00 - 983.00] P:1856.38 E:0.104133 |  and picked up by Yerente,
[983.00 - 985.00] P:1881.08 E:0.102127 |  Amra back with the foot in,
[985.00 - 986.00] P:1981.06 E:0.100086 |  Spain picking up once more,
[986.00 - 987.00] P:1793.24 E:0.110586 |  Ferran Torres then goes down,
[987.00 - 988.00] P:1874.56 E:0.104726 |  he wants the free kick,
[988.00 - 991.00] P:1909.07 E:0.104853 |  the assistant right next to him says no.
[991.00 - 993.00] P:1836.64 E:0.084185 |  It's a Morocco phone, no, no.
[993.00 - 997.00] P:1759.18 E:0.108390 |  Yep, I'm absolutely amazed
[997.00 - 999.00] P:1647.15 E:0.109006 |  that the keeper wants to play it out from there.
[999.00 - 1001.00] P:1688.73 E:0.108621 |  Sometimes it's on, sometimes it's not.
[1001.00 - 1002.00] P:1740.40 E:0.107434 |  Looking at it,
[1002.00 - 1004.00] P:1745.51 E:0.111514 |  they've got a little bit of physicality up around as well,
[1004.00 - 1006.00] P:1533.12 E:0.120386 |  they could maybe use that a wee bit more,
[1006.00 - 1008.00] P:1801.00 E:0.105691 |  but he wants to play it out for the back
[1008.00 - 1010.00] P:1707.41 E:0.115767 |  and do you know what, he's got a way with it so far.
[1010.00 - 1012.00] P:1689.22 E:0.113716 |  As you've said, there's been a few hairy moments
[1012.00 - 1014.00] P:1657.47 E:0.103021 |  in this tournament so far.
[1014.00 - 1016.00] P:1796.16 E:0.104828 |  My heart's in my mouth for him.
[1016.00 - 1018.00] P:1722.93 E:0.102567 |  Every time he does it, back there.
[1018.00 - 1020.00] P:1772.47 E:0.099913 |  By the way, a lot of words about the Spanish supporters,
[1020.00 - 1022.00] P:1918.93 E:0.097019 |  they are massively outnumbered,
[1022.00 - 1023.00] P:2213.28 E:0.095822 |  but they've kept on singing as well,
[1023.00 - 1024.00] P:2312.83 E:0.102325 |  so well done.
[1024.00 - 1026.00] P:2320.15 E:0.103277 |  Yep, good atmosphere,
[1026.00 - 1028.00] P:2163.49 E:0.109396 |  the chees and whistles though are coming
[1028.00 - 1031.00] P:2112.22 E:0.108843 |  from the Moroccan fans with Spain in position.
[1031.00 - 1033.00] P:1878.58 E:0.091941 |  Now it's won back by Amra Bats,
[1033.00 - 1035.00] P:1911.97 E:0.091642 |  who again plays it back to Zaheese
[1035.00 - 1036.00] P:1767.23 E:0.100900 |  under a bit of pressure,
[1036.00 - 1037.00] P:1690.48 E:0.106247 |  they go all the way back to Borne,
[1037.00 - 1038.00] P:1626.75 E:0.100551 |  what's he going to do here?
[1038.00 - 1039.00] P:1725.16 E:0.113071 |  Again he delays,
[1039.00 - 1042.00] P:1798.84 E:0.105646 |  again he lifts it out to Maserari on the left-hand side.
[1042.00 - 1044.00] P:1832.11 E:0.092352 |  Spain know that that is what's going to happen
[1044.00 - 1046.00] P:1737.28 E:0.102856 |  and they put the pressure on there with Ferran Torres
[1046.00 - 1047.00] P:1709.85 E:0.105976 |  and they've won the throw.
[1047.00 - 1048.00] P:1754.93 E:0.098294 |  I think you're right, Pat,
[1048.00 - 1051.00] P:1897.39 E:0.088898 |  it's one of those where you're watching it from up here,
[1051.00 - 1053.00] P:1910.71 E:0.113095 |  behind the stands, I'm with you.
[1053.00 - 1056.00] P:1904.24 E:0.108195 |  My heart is in my mouth every time that happens
[1056.00 - 1058.00] P:1763.19 E:0.108562 |  and also because he's playing it out exactly the same way,
[1058.00 - 1060.00] P:1883.51 E:0.111036 |  all they need to do is get in front of Maserari
[1060.00 - 1062.00] P:1829.11 E:0.109352 |  and suddenly they're in.
[1062.00 - 1065.00] P:1970.47 E:0.104041 |  I'd be surprised if they don't actually catch me at one point,
[1065.00 - 1067.00] P:2015.47 E:0.104734 |  but he actually looks really calm,
[1067.00 - 1069.00] P:2092.57 E:0.112882 |  he looks really comfortable and confident,
[1069.00 - 1071.00] P:2085.52 E:0.112655 |  which kind of tells me he can play a bit,
[1071.00 - 1073.00] P:2052.51 E:0.109035 |  so you know, fair enough,
[1073.00 - 1075.00] P:2117.14 E:0.102838 |  if he not gets away,
[1075.00 - 1076.00] P:2133.28 E:0.117337 |  but if it works,
[1076.00 - 1078.00] P:2061.33 E:0.104243 |  if it works for him,
[1078.00 - 1080.00] P:1860.27 E:0.108595 |  you know, you should keep on doing it,
[1080.00 - 1082.00] P:1960.09 E:0.083121 |  but there are certain go-kippers
[1082.00 - 1085.00] P:1629.08 E:0.106203 |  who want to do that all the time and others.
[1085.00 - 1088.00] P:1755.45 E:0.103335 |  And you know that he wants to get involved in the play,
[1088.00 - 1090.00] P:1790.46 E:0.107925 |  do you know there are keepers like that?
[1090.00 - 1091.00] P:1856.57 E:0.080878 |  You're desperate to go,
[1091.00 - 1094.00] P:1774.99 E:0.106900 |  I'd love to be playing deep man field.
[1094.00 - 1096.00] P:1785.28 E:0.108709 |  He's just throwing a good ball out.
[1096.00 - 1099.00] P:1874.54 E:0.087376 |  His controller balls from Bairney's boot to a field-batch
[1099.00 - 1102.00] P:2027.57 E:0.098127 |  who have missed control a couple of times already.
[1102.00 - 1105.00] P:2091.34 E:0.111076 |  Spain have taken the throw quickly, swung in by Torres,
[1105.00 - 1108.00] P:1864.61 E:0.111206 |  flashes past all the blue shirts inside the penalty area
[1108.00 - 1111.00] P:1737.71 E:0.100181 |  and cleared away by the red shirts of Morocco.
[1111.00 - 1113.00] P:1838.69 E:0.100160 |  Hakimi up towards Zee Esh,
[1113.00 - 1115.00] P:1739.96 E:0.096968 |  no nonsense from La Porte who clears forward,
[1115.00 - 1118.00] P:1763.37 E:0.104973 |  Olmow will pick it up, then Piel for handball there,
[1118.00 - 1121.00] P:1795.18 E:0.091942 |  but the whistle's already gone for a Morocco free kick.
[1121.00 - 1125.00] P:1647.76 E:0.082131 |  And Morocco in possession once more.
[1125.00 - 1128.00] P:1616.98 E:0.093874 |  I think they'd be delighted with it, Morocco.
[1128.00 - 1130.00] P:1792.00 E:0.098637 |  Absolutely delighted, because it looks, you know,
[1130.00 - 1133.00] P:1728.49 E:0.094944 |  for ten minutes as if they're having to get a kick at the ball.
[1133.00 - 1135.00] P:1650.37 E:0.099232 |  But it's a real belief about them, isn't it?
[1135.00 - 1136.00] P:1701.35 E:0.100130 |  Here's the keeper again.
[1136.00 - 1140.00] P:1729.73 E:0.096333 |  He's lumped at this time, well done, probably sensible.
[1140.00 - 1143.00] P:1718.40 E:0.097353 |  Yep, up towards halfway, looking for Sofiam Boufal.
[1143.00 - 1144.00] P:1798.79 E:0.101679 |  Spain will win it back,
[1144.00 - 1147.00] P:1862.80 E:0.094338 |  Foutin, though, in the centre of the park,
[1147.00 - 1150.00] P:2005.01 E:0.091042 |  almost gets it back from Morocco, from Anahi,
[1150.00 - 1154.00] P:1964.85 E:0.094862 |  but Spain will steal the ball back themselves.
[1154.00 - 1158.00] P:1966.95 E:0.089493 |  And then with Pedri going down in the free kick on halfway.
[1158.00 - 1159.00] P:1963.43 E:0.096550 |  Portugal against Switzerland,
[1159.00 - 1164.00] P:1980.44 E:0.102842 |  the final last 16 match coming up for you on five live this evening.
[1164.00 - 1168.00] P:2146.56 E:0.102381 |  Seven o'clock kickoff UK time, Alistair Bruseboul,
[1168.00 - 1171.00] P:2263.98 E:0.109006 |  and Rob Green will be your team for that one here.
[1171.00 - 1174.00] P:2226.13 E:0.103429 |  On five live BBC Sounds in across Africa
[1174.00 - 1178.00] P:2288.59 E:0.103903 |  on the BBC World Service, 19 and a half minutes played.
[1178.00 - 1182.00] P:2187.26 E:0.104360 |  Here's Morocco, Nile, Spain, Nile, Spain play it forward,
[1182.00 - 1184.00] P:1822.70 E:0.098444 |  straight into Anahi.
[1184.00 - 1187.00] P:1775.54 E:0.111601 |  Lovely skill down the left by Sofiam Boufal.
[1187.00 - 1190.00] P:1711.33 E:0.096324 |  Again, goes for the switch of play, looking for Hakim Zes,
[1190.00 - 1191.00] P:1574.72 E:0.104533 |  it's well read by Jordi Alba,
[1191.00 - 1195.00] P:1838.23 E:0.096921 |  almost then just got a little push in the back by Ashraf Hakimi,
[1195.00 - 1197.00] P:1814.12 E:0.089381 |  but the referee is happy to let that go.
[1197.00 - 1201.00] P:1730.85 E:0.106002 |  Morocco can come down the right-hand side, nice play by Zes.
[1201.00 - 1204.00] P:1643.11 E:0.112232 |  Hakimi will pick it up over on the far side, Alba's there with him,
[1204.00 - 1208.00] P:1757.74 E:0.090051 |  So Hakimi just stops and checks and tries to swing it into the area,
[1208.00 - 1211.00] P:1690.36 E:0.110720 |  does manage to get it in, La Porte is there underneath it,
[1211.00 - 1213.00] P:1831.72 E:0.089404 |  heads it up towards halfway,
[1213.00 - 1216.00] P:1787.29 E:0.106033 |  header one in turn by Aguierre of Morocco,
[1216.00 - 1220.00] P:1932.13 E:0.106077 |  and then, I'm about going down and winning the free kick.
[1220.00 - 1223.00] P:1948.98 E:0.109997 |  Again, more and more I rate the Spanish players.
[1223.00 - 1226.00] P:1869.35 E:0.101558 |  They felt that was just a perfectly normal challenge, you know.
[1226.00 - 1227.00] P:1767.62 E:0.117317 |  He pulled the head to head,
[1227.00 - 1229.00] P:1637.75 E:0.104574 |  now I've had a look at it here a second time,
[1229.00 - 1232.00] P:1746.41 E:0.102788 |  do you know what, referee's got that one spot on.
[1232.00 - 1234.00] P:1685.78 E:0.112840 |  Little nudge in the back there, I think it was Gabi,
[1234.00 - 1237.00] P:1715.52 E:0.105293 |  he made sure that he couldn't get the ball,
[1237.00 - 1242.00] P:1748.83 E:0.102991 |  and of course, on the right-hand side with his left foot is Amman Zes,
[1242.00 - 1247.00] P:1677.55 E:0.104621 |  and we all know he can deliver on his sixpence when he is on form.
[1247.00 - 1251.00] P:1820.58 E:0.095542 |  So Hakimi's Zes of Chelsea, an option.
[1251.00 - 1254.00] P:1756.36 E:0.096601 |  Hakimi's over there as well, but it will be Zes, good delivery,
[1254.00 - 1257.00] P:1718.12 E:0.110467 |  it's headed away on the edge of the area, important header,
[1257.00 - 1261.00] P:1766.80 E:0.090541 |  because Salim Amalal was racing into the area,
[1261.00 - 1266.00] P:1648.15 E:0.086417 |  and had that not been cut out, he would have been in for an effort on goal,
[1266.00 - 1270.00] P:1554.07 E:0.089610 |  but it is still 0-0 midway through the first half,
[1270.00 - 1274.00] P:1631.50 E:0.102718 |  as the ball is all the way back with Bono, the Morocco number one.
[1274.00 - 1281.00] P:1574.67 E:0.098660 |  Play is it out to again, and now Sofian Amrabat approaching the halfway line,
[1281.00 - 1285.00] P:1739.63 E:0.097318 |  options over on the left-hand side, so he uses Sofian Bouffal,
[1285.00 - 1287.00] P:1806.33 E:0.120506 |  a lovely skill from Bouffal.
[1287.00 - 1290.00] P:1657.95 E:0.112802 |  One way, then the other, he goes against Llorente, ball into the area,
[1290.00 - 1292.00] P:1658.26 E:0.103986 |  and it's flicked on, Spain just about gets something on it,
[1292.00 - 1294.00] P:1751.01 E:0.109825 |  picked up by Zes, right-hand side of the box,
[1294.00 - 1298.00] P:1759.55 E:0.102767 |  Q defending by Dani Almo back there, who blocks the cross-in as well,
[1298.00 - 1301.00] P:1922.17 E:0.104244 |  and the ball goes out for a Morocco throw,
[1301.00 - 1304.00] P:1866.36 E:0.100521 |  but that's excellent defending by Olmo against Zes.
[1304.00 - 1309.00] P:1646.60 E:0.105613 |  Yeah, he defended well, but Llorente, any feel-back who's done me that much,
[1309.00 - 1312.00] P:1759.09 E:0.111895 |  I mean, it's a classic by the ticket to get back in again.
[1312.00 - 1316.00] P:1820.14 E:0.121707 |  He felt for that, like the worst, almost as bad as famous,
[1316.00 - 1319.00] P:1722.31 E:0.117516 |  you know, Yuan Kruyff many years ago did,
[1319.00 - 1324.00] P:1751.34 E:0.118623 |  but it was a definite take on Dani, Llorente just looked completely at the place,
[1324.00 - 1327.00] P:1740.95 E:0.108710 |  and Bouffal got great left from that.
[1327.00 - 1330.00] P:1637.35 E:0.110507 |  Yeah, he started brightly, the former Southampton man,
[1330.00 - 1333.00] P:1839.26 E:0.091260 |  Morocco picking up on the right-hand side,
[1333.00 - 1335.00] P:1969.51 E:0.110950 |  currently playing his trade with Anjaye,
[1335.00 - 1337.00] P:1833.08 E:0.084787 |  bottom of Ligue 1 at the moment,
[1337.00 - 1341.00] P:1749.65 E:0.090337 |  and another, he returned from injury shortly before the World Cup,
[1341.00 - 1345.00] P:1721.79 E:0.093918 |  it hits those tails that are always so intriguing, isn't it, Pat?
[1345.00 - 1349.00] P:1639.96 E:0.101968 |  You know, Morocco having an absolutely brilliant tournament in the last 16,
[1349.00 - 1352.00] P:1663.31 E:0.104412 |  the second time in their history, the first time for 36 years,
[1352.00 - 1356.00] P:1832.00 E:0.109401 |  and yet several of these players were a couple of weeks away
[1356.00 - 1360.00] P:1690.42 E:0.111026 |  from not being able to be involved as the ball is cleared out by Spain Morocco throw,
[1360.00 - 1362.00] P:1645.73 E:0.109755 |  and they're really growing into this match.
[1362.00 - 1366.00] P:1767.32 E:0.107714 |  Yeah, I mean, as they say, that first 10 minutes, you're not so sure,
[1366.00 - 1371.00] P:1746.36 E:0.101195 |  but slowly they've just got into it very great by defending by Le Porte,
[1371.00 - 1375.00] P:1731.24 E:0.093477 |  he had to get over quite, so back was caught a possession,
[1375.00 - 1380.00] P:1913.96 E:0.096213 |  and they're just little signs now of concern, I would suggest, for the Spanish.
[1380.00 - 1384.00] P:2213.98 E:0.103839 |  You know, they're not being overplayed, but there are signs of concern.
[1384.00 - 1389.00] P:2247.19 E:0.115897 |  Spain in possession, they played out to the right-hand side,
[1389.00 - 1392.00] P:2283.51 E:0.115515 |  and Marcus Llorente, big call by Luis Enrique,
[1392.00 - 1395.00] P:2331.92 E:0.118313 |  who is in hot reverse to making a big call or two,
[1395.00 - 1398.00] P:2282.89 E:0.108383 |  to start Llorente ahead of, has been a quitter,
[1398.00 - 1401.00] P:2283.82 E:0.111405 |  and Carvajal is world-cut debut,
[1402.00 - 1405.00] P:2187.30 E:0.111714 |  just offering a bit more pace down that right-hand side
[1405.00 - 1407.00] P:2161.66 E:0.111471 |  to deal with the pace of Sofie and Bufal,
[1407.00 - 1409.00] P:1908.70 E:0.111930 |  but at the moment Bufal is very much getting the better of him,
[1409.00 - 1411.00] P:1741.45 E:0.109826 |  he's just stolen the ball from Llorente,
[1411.00 - 1412.00] P:1809.76 E:0.105939 |  he's still appealing for the free kick,
[1412.00 - 1416.00] P:1848.46 E:0.097512 |  as Bufal brings it centrally, Morocco have it on the halfway line,
[1416.00 - 1419.00] P:1777.56 E:0.093172 |  Bufal has gone down and stayed down,
[1419.00 - 1421.00] P:1839.80 E:0.089294 |  and the referee has stopped play,
[1421.00 - 1424.00] P:1649.94 E:0.097205 |  so Zee Esch has to stop over on that far side.
[1424.00 - 1425.00] P:1769.32 E:0.047850 |  Nice.
[1425.00 - 1428.00] P:1703.48 E:0.090789 |  You know, first of all Llorente's having a difficult time,
[1428.00 - 1431.00] P:1739.15 E:0.086708 |  but I do think he looks as if he was kicked down,
[1431.00 - 1434.00] P:1776.14 E:0.104188 |  and the referee's, you don't often say about him though,
[1434.00 - 1437.00] P:1738.01 E:0.100378 |  if he's hanging in any particular direction,
[1437.00 - 1439.00] P:1721.67 E:0.098585 |  he's certainly helping Morocco,
[1439.00 - 1441.00] P:1618.13 E:0.097443 |  he's a wee bit more than he's helping the Spanish just now,
[1441.00 - 1442.00] P:1773.56 E:0.076978 |  he's getting a little bit of a loop,
[1442.00 - 1445.00] P:1738.99 E:0.094395 |  and I haven't got a horse in this race,
[1445.00 - 1447.00] P:1807.49 E:0.091403 |  but even me, I'm thinking,
[1447.00 - 1451.00] P:1696.75 E:0.095241 |  this is the referee who's been swayed slightly by the crowd at the moment,
[1451.00 - 1455.00] P:1828.38 E:0.084828 |  and I think, by the way, well with a little stop and play there,
[1455.00 - 1457.00] P:1851.20 E:0.086808 |  Juliette just showed me there,
[1457.00 - 1459.00] P:1683.77 E:0.089698 |  right in front of the supporters,
[1459.00 - 1460.00] P:1686.23 E:0.087315 |  there's a guy with his back to him,
[1460.00 - 1462.00] P:1802.68 E:0.088525 |  he's wearing green trousers,
[1462.00 - 1465.00] P:1747.54 E:0.107335 |  and he is orchestrating every single move,
[1465.00 - 1467.00] P:1669.01 E:0.107947 |  and every single song, so we're hearing it here,
[1467.00 - 1469.00] P:1549.27 E:0.088774 |  and we know we've seen that in the past,
[1469.00 - 1472.00] P:1626.75 E:0.109616 |  this guy's good, he knows and they react
[1472.00 - 1474.00] P:1652.10 E:0.106169 |  to every single thing that he does,
[1474.00 - 1476.00] P:1825.60 E:0.100067 |  on both sides of the ground.
[1476.00 - 1479.00] P:1676.58 E:0.108620 |  What I love as well as Morocco clear the ball away from the back
[1479.00 - 1481.00] P:1977.16 E:0.090524 |  is that every now and then,
[1481.00 - 1483.00] P:1792.07 E:0.100429 |  he's checking over his shoulder just to see what's going on,
[1483.00 - 1485.00] P:1831.52 E:0.102736 |  because as a fan, that's taking one for the team,
[1485.00 - 1487.00] P:1850.41 E:0.094237 |  he's facing the fans,
[1487.00 - 1489.00] P:1719.33 E:0.114500 |  the Spain play the ball into the penalty area,
[1489.00 - 1491.00] P:1983.62 E:0.110422 |  his ball back, and it's off the bar,
[1491.00 - 1493.00] P:1896.98 E:0.113613 |  the flag goes up, brilliant,
[1493.00 - 1496.00] P:1823.47 E:0.112450 |  blocked by Anrabat as well back there,
[1496.00 - 1498.00] P:1911.51 E:0.104055 |  the offside flag went up,
[1498.00 - 1502.00] P:1874.67 E:0.103562 |  Ferran Torres did look offside as the ball was played in,
[1502.00 - 1505.00] P:1888.15 E:0.090967 |  but what defending that is from Anrabat,
[1505.00 - 1507.00] P:1839.85 E:0.112777 |  he didn't know that, he blocks it,
[1507.00 - 1509.00] P:1828.83 E:0.099613 |  Spain really should have put the first half in a way
[1509.00 - 1512.00] P:1689.97 E:0.105149 |  that hit the bar, it would have been ruled out for offside,
[1512.00 - 1514.00] P:1930.51 E:0.104500 |  but it's one of those where, again,
[1514.00 - 1516.00] P:1667.14 E:0.079003 |  Bono's got something on it,
[1516.00 - 1519.00] P:1807.74 E:0.093076 |  as the ball was driven in by Gavi.
[1519.00 - 1521.00] P:1744.21 E:0.074255 |  But it was a great save, wasn't it?
[1521.00 - 1523.00] P:1771.31 E:0.092207 |  Bono gets an arm on it,
[1523.00 - 1526.00] P:1773.73 E:0.097362 |  then it goes up to the crossbar,
[1526.00 - 1528.00] P:1747.94 E:0.106138 |  it's a strange save, but it's a good save,
[1528.00 - 1530.00] P:1757.67 E:0.090954 |  and you're right, the defenders up there,
[1530.00 - 1531.00] P:1702.46 E:0.100820 |  very quick, they can't tell,
[1531.00 - 1533.00] P:1701.01 E:0.096275 |  I mean, they suspected it was offside,
[1533.00 - 1535.00] P:1697.10 E:0.092039 |  but that's exactly the right way to do it,
[1535.00 - 1537.00] P:1549.36 E:0.094779 |  keep on playing until the whistle,
[1537.00 - 1539.00] P:1785.80 E:0.095786 |  it was five yards offside by the real,
[1539.00 - 1542.00] P:1662.03 E:0.108240 |  it was a stick on, but, you know, they kept going.
[1542.00 - 1544.00] P:1706.52 E:0.095297 |  Yep, players keep going, commentators keep going,
[1544.00 - 1546.00] P:1531.38 E:0.105103 |  that's what we have to do, and you never know,
[1546.00 - 1548.00] P:1854.98 E:0.114724 |  we've seen a couple, haven't we Pat,
[1548.00 - 1551.00] P:2217.09 E:0.100246 |  where we thought, oh, that's clearly offside,
[1551.00 - 1553.00] P:2236.41 E:0.116875 |  it's Cameroon going, wasn't it, again,
[1553.00 - 1556.00] P:2287.02 E:0.104765 |  a free-b-car, and in the end it was spot on now,
[1556.00 - 1559.00] P:2090.27 E:0.114713 |  Flagstay down for now with Asensio into the penalty area,
[1559.00 - 1562.00] P:1915.03 E:0.105466 |  side-knitting, Torres was arriving in the centre,
[1562.00 - 1565.00] P:1825.68 E:0.097136 |  and the flag continued to stay down,
[1565.00 - 1568.00] P:1772.62 E:0.105084 |  VAR would have had a look, but that was a big chance for Spain.
[1568.00 - 1570.00] P:1850.96 E:0.092674 |  Do you know about five minutes in, I said,
[1570.00 - 1574.00] P:1928.00 E:0.097734 |  I can see a weakness, that's it, that is exactly it,
[1574.00 - 1576.00] P:1925.80 E:0.114337 |  and you know that it's going to happen at some point,
[1576.00 - 1578.00] P:1822.10 E:0.110488 |  because if you leave that amount of space behind,
[1578.00 - 1581.00] P:1949.40 E:0.112030 |  the moment you do not close down the midfielder,
[1581.00 - 1583.00] P:2004.70 E:0.099217 |  you don't have to be that great,
[1583.00 - 1585.00] P:1905.66 E:0.107076 |  you can flick it in, that's our position,
[1585.00 - 1588.00] P:1797.41 E:0.085214 |  it doesn't get on target, you should do slightly better than that.
[1588.00 - 1591.00] P:1613.32 E:0.097583 |  And having seen the replay, he was onside,
[1591.00 - 1594.00] P:1515.27 E:0.105103 |  I'm not surprised, as I said, five minutes in the game,
[1594.00 - 1598.00] P:1656.26 E:0.080188 |  I can see where the problem is, where the weakness is,
[1598.00 - 1601.00] P:1736.79 E:0.087244 |  in the Spanish players, they can clearly see that,
[1601.00 - 1603.00] P:1691.12 E:0.104423 |  and they've got to get real quality in there,
[1603.00 - 1605.00] P:1994.41 E:0.098128 |  but you have to get good possession in the midfield
[1605.00 - 1607.00] P:2057.29 E:0.106066 |  before you can do that.
[1608.00 - 1612.00] P:1885.21 E:0.103558 |  Asensio goes down, wins the free-kick on the edge of the centre circle,
[1612.00 - 1616.00] P:1807.84 E:0.095552 |  0-0, 26 minutes played in this last 16-type,
[1616.00 - 1620.00] P:1970.54 E:0.089104 |  you're on five live BBC sounds, and a cross-African.
[1621.00 - 1624.00] P:2235.46 E:0.113820 |  On the BBC World Service, here is Rodri in possession,
[1624.00 - 1626.00] P:2205.48 E:0.105158 |  closed down by Amala,
[1626.00 - 1630.00] P:2213.12 E:0.097922 |  but Spain work it out to the left-hand side.
[1630.00 - 1633.00] P:2250.69 E:0.108937 |  Now in field once more to Rodri,
[1633.00 - 1637.00] P:2243.80 E:0.104762 |  Llorente plays it forward, exchanges passes with Gavi,
[1637.00 - 1641.00] P:2136.97 E:0.104888 |  he has toppled more records for Spain at this World Cup,
[1641.00 - 1643.00] P:2194.60 E:0.104139 |  their youngest World Cup goal scorer,
[1643.00 - 1646.00] P:2219.22 E:0.102579 |  their youngest World Cup appearance maker,
[1646.00 - 1649.00] P:1851.09 E:0.103474 |  still just 18 years of age,
[1649.00 - 1652.00] P:1771.58 E:0.101621 |  the Barcelona man as the ball goes out to the left-hand side,
[1652.00 - 1654.00] P:2240.92 E:0.099310 |  Spain have it once more, 0-0,
[1654.00 - 1656.00] P:2380.59 E:0.107519 |  Rodri comes over the halfway line,
[1656.00 - 1659.00] P:2298.62 E:0.106728 |  and the whistles and the cheers start up again,
[1659.00 - 1662.00] P:2124.08 E:0.118811 |  and the man in the green trousers is checking over his shoulder
[1662.00 - 1665.00] P:2066.29 E:0.112190 |  to see what Spain are doing, he's waving his arms,
[1665.00 - 1667.00] P:2169.84 E:0.109332 |  the drum being beaten,
[1667.00 - 1670.00] P:2167.71 E:0.101112 |  the red and white drum right in front of him,
[1670.00 - 1672.00] P:2226.07 E:0.108543 |  he's good at keeping time, isn't he,
[1672.00 - 1674.00] P:2179.29 E:0.105620 |  whilst also good at multitasking, I think we can say,
[1674.00 - 1676.00] P:2052.75 E:0.111113 |  is Spain have it on the halfway line?
[1676.00 - 1678.00] P:2259.35 E:0.111244 |  I'm worried about him, see if he loses his foot now,
[1678.00 - 1681.00] P:2209.10 E:0.099397 |  he'll be out for the next game.
[1681.00 - 1684.00] P:2142.49 E:0.100278 |  Spain have the ball over on the far side,
[1684.00 - 1687.00] P:2264.45 E:0.111090 |  goal is him, Morocco looking to reach the quarter-finals
[1687.00 - 1690.00] P:2264.02 E:0.097805 |  for the first time in their history,
[1690.00 - 1693.00] P:2157.01 E:0.107531 |  so the port has it, and now Morocco going back
[1693.00 - 1698.00] P:2116.80 E:0.096611 |  into those banks to try and get Spain to have to play through them
[1698.00 - 1700.00] P:1863.93 E:0.111757 |  as the ball is into the penalty area,
[1700.00 - 1702.00] P:1722.91 E:0.108565 |  takes the deflection and leaves up for Bono.
[1702.00 - 1705.00] P:1955.43 E:0.099313 |  The thing about that run, we were talking about where they've got a weakness,
[1705.00 - 1709.00] P:1797.84 E:0.088830 |  the problem is Spain haven't got an absolute natural to make that run,
[1709.00 - 1713.00] P:1880.38 E:0.088135 |  there are certain players who, you're living in that sort of position,
[1713.00 - 1716.00] P:1848.72 E:0.098334 |  they love to get from just the eight of the ten and get behind,
[1716.00 - 1718.00] P:1812.68 E:0.084396 |  they've got eights and tens and players that have,
[1718.00 - 1720.00] P:1846.42 E:0.103978 |  but they generally want to stay with the ball,
[1720.00 - 1723.00] P:1904.15 E:0.096730 |  and hold the ball and not make those runs constantly beyond,
[1723.00 - 1726.00] P:1903.27 E:0.104088 |  so it's up to Ferranter, it's up to Almor,
[1726.00 - 1729.00] P:1881.85 E:0.101219 |  to continue doing it for the one that finally pays off.
[1729.00 - 1732.00] P:1833.42 E:0.099207 |  Ball out to the right-hand side by Amra Bac, to Ziesh,
[1732.00 - 1735.00] P:1841.36 E:0.088791 |  she will pull it back to Hakimi,
[1735.00 - 1737.00] P:1711.52 E:0.102825 |  and we're all the way back with Aguierd,
[1737.00 - 1741.00] P:1798.29 E:0.080564 |  and we're all the way back with Bono, the Morocco keeper.
[1741.00 - 1744.00] P:1530.54 E:0.103489 |  He sends it up to the halfway line, looking to get over the head of Llorente,
[1744.00 - 1746.00] P:1734.56 E:0.100831 |  he chests it down, but again, Bufal anticipates,
[1746.00 - 1749.00] P:1840.32 E:0.083433 |  wins the ball, Llorente trips him,
[1749.00 - 1753.00] P:1574.64 E:0.099388 |  that is not going too well at Spain at right back so far.
[1753.00 - 1756.00] P:1872.29 E:0.090346 |  He just doesn't look natural out there,
[1756.00 - 1759.00] P:2172.39 E:0.097565 |  I mean he can play so many positions, can he, Llorente?
[1759.00 - 1762.00] P:2254.70 E:0.101198 |  But, you know, often if you put a centre-back in a midfield,
[1762.00 - 1766.00] P:2162.64 E:0.101991 |  it's a very special position for a back, it's seriously specialist.
[1766.00 - 1769.00] P:2148.57 E:0.100882 |  You know, in my career, a centre-back came out to Mark,
[1769.00 - 1772.00] P:2150.13 E:0.097725 |  a right-back, a left-back, I'm thinking partying,
[1772.00 - 1776.00] P:2063.42 E:0.099228 |  and he does look as if he's not as comfortable as others.
[1777.00 - 1779.00] P:1823.29 E:0.119445 |  Morocco intercepts the ball,
[1779.00 - 1781.00] P:1772.37 E:0.103942 |  Sais plays it forward to the edge of the area,
[1781.00 - 1784.00] P:1881.52 E:0.099193 |  very, very calmly done by Rodri,
[1784.00 - 1787.00] P:1797.06 E:0.100489 |  steers it all the way back to Unise Seamon.
[1787.00 - 1790.00] P:1883.36 E:0.102178 |  They're trying to out-cool each other, aren't they, these defenders?
[1790.00 - 1793.00] P:1935.08 E:0.089701 |  I can't believe he tried to play that long, so he didn't try to.
[1793.00 - 1795.00] P:1886.81 E:0.103219 |  He actually played that back to his goalkeeper there,
[1795.00 - 1799.00] P:1908.09 E:0.092057 |  the pressure was under, he was getting chased down.
[1799.00 - 1803.00] P:1876.18 E:0.096692 |  Now in this area, he's a goal scorer, he can score, he will chase.
[1803.00 - 1807.00] P:1883.07 E:0.086926 |  It was millimetres, but he looked comfortable, didn't he?
[1807.00 - 1809.00] P:1544.22 E:0.116905 |  He did, Le Vorte on the ball over the half-way line,
[1809.00 - 1812.00] P:1754.23 E:0.103465 |  we know he's usually midfield, he has fielded in for Manchester City
[1812.00 - 1816.00] P:1957.50 E:0.101969 |  at centre-half as well, but that was a midfielders' ball back.
[1817.00 - 1820.00] P:1943.08 E:0.101622 |  He's in centre-half's position to the goalkeeper,
[1820.00 - 1822.00] P:1895.60 E:0.106664 |  and he did it very well as Rodri picks up the ball
[1822.00 - 1824.00] P:1953.66 E:0.105704 |  on the edge of the centre-circle,
[1824.00 - 1828.00] P:1884.16 E:0.109818 |  as the noise rises once more inside Education City.
[1830.00 - 1835.00] P:1981.73 E:0.106903 |  The Morocco fans believe that their team can make history this evening.
[1835.00 - 1837.00] P:1678.61 E:0.109604 |  The most important day in our footballing history,
[1837.00 - 1841.00] P:1721.01 E:0.101271 |  that's what manager Walid Regragi has called it,
[1841.00 - 1845.00] P:1682.25 E:0.099076 |  Spain in possession, just inside the Morocco half,
[1845.00 - 1850.00] P:1874.66 E:0.100832 |  0-0 on five-life BBC sounds in across Africa on the BBC World Service.
[1850.00 - 1853.00] P:2067.14 E:0.101911 |  He talked about bringing popular players like Ziersh back.
[1853.00 - 1857.00] P:2138.70 E:0.106312 |  Regragi himself such a popular player when it comes to Morocco's history,
[1857.00 - 1861.00] P:1932.20 E:0.103994 |  it was part of the side that reached the Africa Cup Nations final back in 2004,
[1861.00 - 1866.00] P:1897.69 E:0.085286 |  as Bono clears away from Morocco up towards half-way,
[1866.00 - 1869.00] P:1800.97 E:0.108406 |  and had impressed so much domestically too,
[1869.00 - 1872.00] P:1881.82 E:0.095550 |  as Manali wins a free-kick on half-way.
[1872.00 - 1876.00] P:1792.86 E:0.093238 |  Sorry, Camovie Vicky, Gavi just get taken out in the back there,
[1876.00 - 1879.00] P:1791.56 E:0.087067 |  referee gives nothing, the ball comes up seconds later,
[1879.00 - 1882.00] P:1920.48 E:0.101224 |  immediately going to give a free-kick to Morocco.
[1882.00 - 1884.00] P:1882.37 E:0.101211 |  Now, it's actually quite stunning,
[1884.00 - 1886.00] P:1753.97 E:0.105157 |  and it's now becoming quite noticeable
[1886.00 - 1889.00] P:1799.24 E:0.104708 |  that the Spanish players are getting really infuriated by it.
[1890.00 - 1892.00] P:1700.48 E:0.116928 |  Now, Luis Enrique as well as Morocco,
[1892.00 - 1894.00] P:1629.06 E:0.102766 |  playing up towards the edge of the penalty area,
[1894.00 - 1897.00] P:1847.42 E:0.081079 |  pulled back to the left back, Masraoui,
[1897.00 - 1899.00] P:1685.08 E:0.099400 |  and now here is Sofie Ambufeu,
[1899.00 - 1902.00] P:1688.92 E:0.101181 |  getting a lot of joy against Llorente down the left-hand side from Morocco.
[1902.00 - 1905.00] P:1802.98 E:0.095115 |  The ball in was poor though, but Morocco have won it back.
[1905.00 - 1908.00] P:1753.50 E:0.089815 |  Here is Bufal once more, and they're doubling up on him now.
[1908.00 - 1912.00] P:1863.45 E:0.088880 |  And that shows you what a torrid time he is giving Llorente.
[1912.00 - 1914.00] P:1775.47 E:0.109832 |  Gavi, it was coming over to help out.
[1914.00 - 1916.00] P:1735.48 E:0.109750 |  So Morocco say, all right, we'll go down the right-hand side,
[1916.00 - 1919.00] P:1815.00 E:0.094122 |  because we've got Chelsea's Hakim Ziersh over there,
[1919.00 - 1923.00] P:1757.31 E:0.105353 |  and here he goes, trying to work his way down to the bar line,
[1923.00 - 1926.00] P:1748.15 E:0.113476 |  but Jordi Alba gets a foot in, Morocco throw nil-nil.
[1926.00 - 1928.00] P:1815.53 E:0.104363 |  Yeah, and when he goes from left to right,
[1928.00 - 1930.00] P:1728.37 E:0.106452 |  you know they'll get great skill there.
[1930.00 - 1933.00] P:1809.04 E:0.101492 |  And he's actually a different player when he's wearing a Moroccan shirt.
[1933.00 - 1937.00] P:1860.46 E:0.102401 |  You know, he looks more live and more up to it, the upper it.
[1937.00 - 1942.00] P:1868.58 E:0.108331 |  He basically, he is a central player for them, so I'll carry on in a minute.
[1942.00 - 1944.00] P:1720.64 E:0.112814 |  Very good defending by Masraoui in the shot,
[1944.00 - 1947.00] P:1822.63 E:0.106047 |  Drivenini saved by Unais Simon.
[1947.00 - 1951.00] P:1993.35 E:0.096017 |  Morocco have their tails up, nil-nil.
[1951.00 - 1954.00] P:1904.89 E:0.113035 |  Well, you can see him wind them that one up for about four seconds, can you?
[1954.00 - 1956.00] P:1785.52 E:0.085716 |  He's going to have a hat here.
[1956.00 - 1959.00] P:1789.86 E:0.109912 |  It's a long way out, it went through bodies, it's one of those ones.
[1959.00 - 1963.00] P:1863.33 E:0.095583 |  Hanagot, a little bit of deflection, and by the way,
[1963.00 - 1966.00] P:1813.13 E:0.103892 |  it did touch the shirt of Rodri, didn't it?
[1966.00 - 1970.00] P:1906.30 E:0.088483 |  Hanagot deflection, I don't think he can save that.
[1970.00 - 1972.00] P:1895.57 E:0.115782 |  Ball forward by Spain is a good one,
[1972.00 - 1975.00] P:1754.17 E:0.101293 |  and since he just can't take it in his stride, if he had done,
[1975.00 - 1978.00] P:1601.14 E:0.106401 |  he would have been in, it's all the way through with Bono, it's nil-nil.
[1978.00 - 1981.00] P:1675.84 E:0.087591 |  That ball again, it's exactly the same ball,
[1981.00 - 1985.00] P:1749.68 E:0.104035 |  and I'm noticing it's happened time and again, just now and again, it's on.
[1985.00 - 1989.00] P:1688.62 E:0.108414 |  And the thing is, if you keep on playing the way that Morocco are playing just now,
[1989.00 - 1992.00] P:1745.04 E:0.098485 |  you know, there's a lot more of the balls being passed by the Spanish,
[1992.00 - 1996.00] P:2013.58 E:0.094627 |  they're getting a lot more in position, but it gets harder to cut that,
[1996.00 - 1998.00] P:2177.36 E:0.113900 |  it gets harder to close down the midfield,
[1998.00 - 2001.00] P:2244.86 E:0.117036 |  because as soon as you let, you know, this gets to the player,
[2001.00 - 2006.00] P:2283.20 E:0.110525 |  Pedru special, Gaby special, if you give them any space at all,
[2006.00 - 2009.00] P:2279.95 E:0.106666 |  and their head gets up and there's a gap behind, they will find it,
[2009.00 - 2011.00] P:2312.78 E:0.117657 |  they absolutely will find it.
[2011.00 - 2014.00] P:2244.91 E:0.103321 |  Here comes Rodri for Spain, stops and checks,
[2014.00 - 2016.00] P:2175.97 E:0.104768 |  on the edge of the centre circle, forward to Pedru,
[2016.00 - 2019.00] P:2030.07 E:0.113155 |  brilliant ball through to Ferran Torres, down to the bar line,
[2019.00 - 2022.00] P:2007.58 E:0.109271 |  digs it in from the right-hand side, Akimis there, wins the header,
[2022.00 - 2025.00] P:1865.42 E:0.109126 |  comes out to Dani Olmo, that's brilliant defending by Zs,
[2025.00 - 2028.00] P:1873.60 E:0.104667 |  just stole back and took it off almost, toes inside the penalty area,
[2028.00 - 2030.00] P:1916.15 E:0.110959 |  Spain having once more, but it's broken down,
[2030.00 - 2034.00] P:1852.70 E:0.104268 |  and now Morocco can try and counter, down the left-hand side, they go,
[2034.00 - 2037.00] P:1820.74 E:0.104986 |  Boufal tries the cross with Paul again, it's really poor,
[2037.00 - 2039.00] P:1835.74 E:0.106312 |  it bounces all the way through to Unicez,
[2039.00 - 2042.00] P:1822.16 E:0.104495 |  all in bright yellow inside the Spain penalty area.
[2042.00 - 2046.00] P:2049.73 E:0.091994 |  I'm just looking at that back lane now, they're asking the question,
[2046.00 - 2049.00] P:2217.83 E:0.107227 |  they're turning over the manager, do you want it this high,
[2049.00 - 2052.00] P:2212.74 E:0.113302 |  are you sure you want it this high, both centre-halves have turned around the manager,
[2052.00 - 2055.00] P:2291.25 E:0.111510 |  and he said, yeah, that's what I want you, keep doing it,
[2055.00 - 2060.00] P:2257.88 E:0.110343 |  it's a tight one, and it's a lane, but it's a high wire lane.
[2060.00 - 2064.00] P:2118.98 E:0.113379 |  Here is Jordi Alba, lovely turn by Gaby, down to the left-hand side of the penalty area,
[2064.00 - 2068.00] P:2057.86 E:0.115605 |  plays the ball across, will come all the way through to the other side of the box with Ferran Torres,
[2068.00 - 2072.00] P:2079.51 E:0.107482 |  down to the bar line, couple of twists and turns, still has it Torres,
[2072.00 - 2075.00] P:2136.40 E:0.098534 |  despite the challenge coming in, and Rotary has it now,
[2075.00 - 2078.00] P:2175.27 E:0.116398 |  and they're really pushing up now, the light blue shirts of Spain,
[2078.00 - 2082.00] P:2197.20 E:0.112555 |  out to the left-hand side, they go once more, Hakimi with the foot in,
[2082.00 - 2086.00] P:2233.47 E:0.116419 |  so Spain go back again to Le Port, the Morocco fans whistling and cheering,
[2086.00 - 2090.00] P:2141.60 E:0.114014 |  and trying to put Spain off their stride,
[2090.00 - 2093.00] P:2176.87 E:0.116666 |  but they're getting into their stride now, Spain, as they play it forward,
[2093.00 - 2096.00] P:2186.85 E:0.119590 |  little one-two on the edge of the penalty area, out to the right-hand side,
[2096.00 - 2100.00] P:2176.08 E:0.113134 |  and Ferran Torres, the red shirts are back in numbers for Morocco,
[2100.00 - 2104.00] P:2168.53 E:0.110994 |  Pedri has it, just outside the box, plays it back once more to Le Port,
[2104.00 - 2109.00] P:2122.92 E:0.107565 |  30 yards out, slides it through, Olmo, lovely control, tried to chip it out once again,
[2109.00 - 2114.00] P:1870.82 E:0.102693 |  headed away by Morocco, and then, Reinaji is caught on the edge of the area,
[2114.00 - 2118.00] P:1804.34 E:0.099216 |  he cleared it up towards halfway anyway, and Morocco will have a free kick,
[2118.00 - 2120.00] P:1619.19 E:0.095691 |  but that was more like it from Spain.
[2120.00 - 2123.00] P:1629.27 E:0.106907 |  Whoa, the Moroccan needed that breather, didn't he?
[2123.00 - 2127.00] P:1780.70 E:0.096644 |  They knew they were in real trouble there, it is a free kick, and that's...
[2127.00 - 2131.00] P:1725.88 E:0.101675 |  You know, if you get that amount of space, you slow down,
[2131.00 - 2134.00] P:1633.57 E:0.099190 |  if you get that close down, you sink to yourself, right,
[2134.00 - 2137.00] P:1778.66 E:0.102211 |  my team are under serious, serious pressure here,
[2137.00 - 2140.00] P:1747.66 E:0.100801 |  give them a little bit of a break, because hands being kept on going
[2140.00 - 2143.00] P:1717.83 E:0.105188 |  for another minute or so, that you feel as if they were going to break through,
[2143.00 - 2149.00] P:1724.98 E:0.088269 |  long, deep breath now, for those Moroccan defenders, because they live dangerous like that.
[2149.00 - 2153.00] P:1803.48 E:0.085975 |  It's whether Spain can actually keep on doing it at that pace for the entire time,
[2153.00 - 2155.00] P:1656.48 E:0.085473 |  I don't think they can, that's the problem.
[2155.00 - 2157.00] P:1700.28 E:0.107143 |  Well, it's been ebb and flow, hasn't it, from Spain,
[2157.00 - 2160.00] P:1716.70 E:0.095698 |  and that's partly because Morocco have been pushing them back,
[2160.00 - 2163.00] P:1650.64 E:0.094691 |  but they've taken their time over that free kick,
[2163.00 - 2166.00] P:1525.18 E:0.097701 |  just as Pat says, to give themselves that little bit of a breather,
[2166.00 - 2169.00] P:1826.75 E:0.096987 |  and we're about almost getting a foot in, Spain will have it though,
[2169.00 - 2173.00] P:1994.21 E:0.099806 |  out to the right-hand side, and Llorente, who goes all the way back to Rodry,
[2173.00 - 2176.00] P:2090.39 E:0.109913 |  who touched it back to Simon, closed down by Enesiri,
[2176.00 - 2179.00] P:2094.21 E:0.104369 |  who hasn't had too much to work with the Tall Morocco striker,
[2179.00 - 2181.00] P:2140.32 E:0.093466 |  and Spain will bring it forward.
[2181.00 - 2185.00] P:2139.82 E:0.094707 |  You mentioned the slight brush of the shirt there that the ball had on Rodry
[2185.00 - 2188.00] P:2196.55 E:0.106263 |  a couple of minutes ago, talking about brushes of the shirt,
[2188.00 - 2191.00] P:2004.02 E:0.105441 |  that's why Roman Saïs has a goal so far in this World Cup,
[2191.00 - 2195.00] P:1836.56 E:0.104074 |  so Beery's free kick against Belgium, looked as though it had gone all the way in,
[2195.00 - 2200.00] P:1825.91 E:0.100517 |  took the slightest nick of Saïs's shirt, as Morocco won't keep it in on the far side.
[2200.00 - 2203.00] P:1707.60 E:0.105691 |  It's one of those where it doesn't even change the flight of the ball,
[2203.00 - 2206.00] P:1794.18 E:0.106076 |  but because here they have the sensors in the ball, they really can tell
[2206.00 - 2209.00] P:1883.05 E:0.092923 |  if it's brushed a player, if it's touched a player at all.
[2209.00 - 2212.00] P:1953.81 E:0.101650 |  So FIFA gave the goal to Saïs. Do you know what Saïs did?
[2212.00 - 2214.00] P:2065.60 E:0.108935 |  He said, give it to Beery, he deserves it.
[2214.00 - 2216.00] P:2068.14 E:0.108615 |  Now, who does that not remind you of?
[2216.00 - 2218.00] P:2220.64 E:0.082158 |  Um, yes.
[2218.00 - 2221.00] P:2251.17 E:0.111619 |  I saw a little gentleman who may be playing a wee bit later on tonight,
[2221.00 - 2223.00] P:2319.55 E:0.116704 |  that we can hear in Radio 5 Live.
[2223.00 - 2226.00] P:2223.88 E:0.111460 |  Completely coincidentally, Portugal against Switzerland is coming up,
[2226.00 - 2229.00] P:2163.91 E:0.106154 |  7 o'clock UK time, Alice De Grisball,
[2229.00 - 2232.00] P:2202.76 E:0.106711 |  and Rob Green, your commentary team for that one,
[2232.00 - 2234.00] P:2196.62 E:0.110211 |  did you win us on 5 Live in BBC Sounds,
[2234.00 - 2237.00] P:2186.29 E:0.113870 |  here across Africa on the World Service as well.
[2237.00 - 2240.00] P:2010.37 E:0.112292 |  It's 0-0 between Morocco and Spain in this last 16 tie
[2240.00 - 2242.00] P:1879.41 E:0.105759 |  as the ball goes out of play from a Morocco throw,
[2242.00 - 2245.00] P:1799.35 E:0.105160 |  and Spain again are protesting this time for Antares,
[2245.00 - 2248.00] P:1887.94 E:0.084579 |  is chewing the assistant 0, but to no avail,
[2248.00 - 2252.00] P:1760.43 E:0.101798 |  and Morocco have this throw deep inside their own territory.
[2252.00 - 2256.00] P:1937.65 E:0.105437 |  What the Moroccans would love to get is that they could get before,
[2256.00 - 2258.00] P:1989.60 E:0.105480 |  or they could get the ace in the final clock.
[2258.00 - 2261.00] P:1929.07 E:0.104693 |  Now, high up the pitch, in an area where they've got one-on-one,
[2261.00 - 2264.00] P:1866.39 E:0.099784 |  they could get some sort of help to the centre forward.
[2264.00 - 2266.00] P:1725.29 E:0.105458 |  As you said just a moment ago,
[2266.00 - 2269.00] P:1743.99 E:0.090409 |  in the series, he's had very, very little to work on,
[2269.00 - 2272.00] P:1856.81 E:0.096694 |  and he's chased, and he's hurried, and he's using his physicality
[2272.00 - 2274.00] P:1936.55 E:0.085860 |  as much as he can.
[2274.00 - 2277.00] P:1909.02 E:0.110774 |  He's getting nothing out of Roger and La Porte at the moment.
[2277.00 - 2280.00] P:1960.18 E:0.100230 |  Well, he's actually come deep there, with Spain having it in the centre circle.
[2280.00 - 2282.00] P:1882.24 E:0.104868 |  He did win the header from the throw in the series,
[2282.00 - 2285.00] P:1972.57 E:0.097792 |  tried to flick it on towards Sophie Ambu Foul.
[2286.00 - 2289.00] P:1577.61 E:0.096442 |  But Spain, intercepted, and Morocco will do the same,
[2289.00 - 2293.00] P:1675.70 E:0.092891 |  and have it outside their own penalty area, 0-0.
[2293.00 - 2296.00] P:1761.99 E:0.084037 |  As Hakimi plays it out to that right-hand side,
[2296.00 - 2299.00] P:1716.87 E:0.099059 |  and Anahi ball over the top, Hakimi will chase,
[2299.00 - 2302.00] P:1657.22 E:0.099450 |  so won't keep it in just too much on it out for a Spain throw.
[2302.00 - 2304.00] P:1846.79 E:0.095930 |  You know, it's quite as Morocco,
[2304.00 - 2307.00] P:1836.51 E:0.081620 |  if you look at how they've played all the way through this tournament,
[2307.00 - 2309.00] P:1869.02 E:0.091761 |  you know, they suck up a bit of pressure,
[2309.00 - 2312.00] P:1988.18 E:0.090718 |  they're accepting they're not going to get a lot of the ball in certain situations,
[2312.00 - 2316.00] P:2016.74 E:0.092322 |  but they, I mean, they change speed of attack,
[2316.00 - 2319.00] P:2039.01 E:0.100744 |  and then the angle of the champ, so unexpectedly,
[2319.00 - 2321.00] P:2135.44 E:0.110825 |  because they do it so irregularly,
[2321.00 - 2324.00] P:2127.87 E:0.102707 |  and Anahi are feeling they're just holding on,
[2324.00 - 2326.00] P:2142.78 E:0.106780 |  wanting to get to maybe the last 20 minutes or so,
[2326.00 - 2328.00] P:2095.66 E:0.105936 |  and I think they can let loose a wee bit,
[2328.00 - 2330.00] P:2184.45 E:0.107399 |  but they want to wait at that amount of time.
[2330.00 - 2333.00] P:2272.13 E:0.106969 |  Dangerous play, a very dangerous play,
[2333.00 - 2337.00] P:2214.44 E:0.105545 |  but it feels like they can just hold on to this game, keep it at 0-0,
[2337.00 - 2339.00] P:2190.71 E:0.112950 |  and they've got very close to getting on the way half-time.
[2339.00 - 2342.00] P:2282.12 E:0.100582 |  After that, they can let loose.
[2342.00 - 2344.00] P:2164.08 E:0.108755 |  Spain coming down the left-hand side,
[2344.00 - 2346.00] P:2016.53 E:0.110775 |  they've ball into the penalty area,
[2346.00 - 2348.00] P:1819.37 E:0.109239 |  pleaded away by Masrari,
[2348.00 - 2350.00] P:1859.82 E:0.092213 |  it was another good delivery down the left,
[2350.00 - 2354.00] P:1798.20 E:0.097018 |  but no light blue shirt in the right place to receive it from Gavi,
[2354.00 - 2357.00] P:1670.25 E:0.107282 |  and now Morocco can come forward out to the left-hand side,
[2357.00 - 2359.00] P:1708.38 E:0.100733 |  we've found we'll just about get there,
[2359.00 - 2362.00] P:1799.29 E:0.083945 |  Dink sits through three blue shirts,
[2362.00 - 2364.00] P:1567.78 E:0.104286 |  back towards his own goal,
[2364.00 - 2368.00] P:1780.97 E:0.085070 |  but Amrabat sends the ball forwards with no real purpose,
[2369.00 - 2372.00] P:1928.91 E:0.082861 |  and Spain will pick up possession midway through their own half.
[2372.00 - 2375.00] P:2079.58 E:0.105169 |  Remind you, you can listen to all the debate, reaction and analysis
[2375.00 - 2378.00] P:1973.68 E:0.104422 |  on the World Cup Daily podcast,
[2378.00 - 2380.00] P:2102.47 E:0.089399 |  download that every day from BBC Sounds,
[2380.00 - 2382.00] P:2065.54 E:0.104501 |  and the Sports Desk podcast is your place to go
[2382.00 - 2388.00] P:2203.61 E:0.103884 |  if you want a wider look at the issues around this World Cup tournament.
[2388.00 - 2390.00] P:2129.22 E:0.107185 |  All out to the left-hand side,
[2390.00 - 2392.00] P:2215.86 E:0.104421 |  here goes Spain over the halfway line,
[2392.00 - 2395.00] P:2222.16 E:0.107896 |  we'll scoop the ball across to Rodri,
[2395.00 - 2397.00] P:2198.04 E:0.093100 |  just inside the centre-circle,
[2397.00 - 2399.00] P:2229.64 E:0.104405 |  plays it forward now to Pedri,
[2399.00 - 2401.00] P:2255.95 E:0.113810 |  the run had been made through the centre,
[2401.00 - 2404.00] P:2206.84 E:0.095456 |  but Pedri didn't quite release Marco Asensio in time,
[2404.00 - 2406.00] P:2113.79 E:0.111409 |  so they're working out to the left-hand side once more,
[2406.00 - 2408.00] P:2155.15 E:0.111356 |  Jordi Alba looking for the run of Dani Alma,
[2408.00 - 2410.00] P:1832.62 E:0.103809 |  that's very well defended over there.
[2410.00 - 2412.00] P:1876.80 E:0.113027 |  I mean, this is it, isn't it?
[2412.00 - 2415.00] P:1839.31 E:0.101024 |  Morocco, individually, so many players are having brilliant tournaments,
[2415.00 - 2418.00] P:1885.80 E:0.091892 |  but to get to this stage, to the last 16,
[2418.00 - 2420.00] P:1640.81 E:0.105958 |  for the first time in 36 years,
[2420.00 - 2422.00] P:1826.46 E:0.104553 |  they needed their biggest players to step up,
[2422.00 - 2425.00] P:1709.65 E:0.101598 |  ZH has been brilliant, and Ashraf Hakimi has been brilliant.
[2425.00 - 2429.00] P:1687.04 E:0.106176 |  Yeah, and I suppose the way the team's set up has been brilliant as well,
[2429.00 - 2431.00] P:1861.99 E:0.095929 |  but Hakimi actually right out of the stand there,
[2431.00 - 2433.00] P:1725.75 E:0.102005 |  looked a little bit nervous for me,
[2433.00 - 2435.00] P:1792.38 E:0.091348 |  but he's actually grown into the game,
[2435.00 - 2437.00] P:1686.73 E:0.108988 |  and he's got an amazing pace when he breaks,
[2437.00 - 2438.00] P:1836.92 E:0.087809 |  on that right-hand side.
[2438.00 - 2440.00] P:1781.17 E:0.105692 |  I talked to the link-up, the left-field back,
[2440.00 - 2442.00] P:1835.88 E:0.084718 |  and the left-winger, the same in the right,
[2442.00 - 2444.00] P:1750.50 E:0.100773 |  it's not been working quite as well,
[2444.00 - 2446.00] P:1751.03 E:0.093619 |  but don't write it off in this game yet,
[2446.00 - 2448.00] P:1787.78 E:0.096237 |  absolutely don't write it off.
[2449.00 - 2451.00] P:1744.38 E:0.087829 |  Ball over the top from Bono,
[2451.00 - 2455.00] P:1854.77 E:0.098310 |  Chester Danwell by Bufal, who was caught,
[2455.00 - 2457.00] P:1888.02 E:0.100704 |  says the referee by Gavi,
[2457.00 - 2459.00] P:1926.76 E:0.101003 |  who ran away wagging his finger,
[2459.00 - 2460.00] P:1874.14 E:0.093146 |  well switched on there from Spain,
[2460.00 - 2463.00] P:1857.60 E:0.087673 |  because Morocco thought about taking that free quickly
[2463.00 - 2466.00] P:1773.75 E:0.094227 |  with Amraba, despite Bufal still being down,
[2466.00 - 2468.00] P:1600.78 E:0.091556 |  but it's another one-pack where Spain feeling
[2468.00 - 2471.00] P:1761.91 E:0.098257 |  that they've not got the rubber degree.
[2471.00 - 2472.00] P:1882.21 E:0.099136 |  It doesn't matter, actually.
[2472.00 - 2474.00] P:1847.28 E:0.095329 |  In this game, you have to just accept it,
[2474.00 - 2476.00] P:1767.58 E:0.092177 |  you have to put it off with it.
[2476.00 - 2478.00] P:1760.11 E:0.107525 |  If you walk about more than all the time,
[2478.00 - 2481.00] P:1761.61 E:0.094139 |  and you lose your concentration in your play,
[2481.00 - 2483.00] P:1823.49 E:0.088982 |  which fortunately they didn't there,
[2483.00 - 2485.00] P:1824.69 E:0.083046 |  then it can have a negative effect,
[2485.00 - 2487.00] P:1665.40 E:0.083712 |  and it can have that negative effect in how you're playing,
[2487.00 - 2490.00] P:1912.89 E:0.088245 |  so the Spanish feel upset about it,
[2490.00 - 2492.00] P:1731.72 E:0.085643 |  but they have to put it to the back of Amraba.
[2492.00 - 2493.00] P:1726.62 E:0.109679 |  They did lose their concentration,
[2493.00 - 2494.00] P:1530.89 E:0.091975 |  but Gavi is still complaining,
[2494.00 - 2497.00] P:1692.04 E:0.094332 |  he's as good as multitasking as our friend
[2497.00 - 2498.00] P:1632.99 E:0.120667 |  in the green trousers over there,
[2498.00 - 2500.00] P:1597.90 E:0.106514 |  still orchestrating the Morocco fans,
[2500.00 - 2502.00] P:1528.55 E:0.101496 |  who have now got their phones out and are waving
[2502.00 - 2504.00] P:1620.40 E:0.105656 |  at the other end of the ground as their team attack
[2504.00 - 2507.00] P:1679.18 E:0.098921 |  down this left-hand side, ball into the penalty area,
[2507.00 - 2510.00] P:1803.65 E:0.102563 |  cleared away poorly, will come back into the penalty area
[2510.00 - 2513.00] P:1763.79 E:0.102590 |  from the right-hand side, well headed away by Biscuits,
[2513.00 - 2516.00] P:1730.36 E:0.093609 |  picked up by Bufail, who digs it back in once more,
[2516.00 - 2519.00] P:1607.81 E:0.110867 |  and the header is over from the edge of the six-yard box,
[2519.00 - 2524.00] P:1832.92 E:0.094901 |  and what a chance that was for Morocco and West Hamza again.
[2524.00 - 2527.00] P:1800.00 E:0.102738 |  Yeah, again, it's got into a brilliant area.
[2527.00 - 2529.00] P:1953.12 E:0.095094 |  I would argue that's the best chance of the game.
[2529.00 - 2531.00] P:1810.61 E:0.096350 |  I would say definitely the best chance of the game.
[2531.00 - 2533.00] P:1859.11 E:0.095375 |  They get into a good position,
[2533.00 - 2535.00] P:1795.88 E:0.099926 |  not a good clearance in the first place,
[2535.00 - 2538.00] P:1856.85 E:0.101114 |  goes to the right-hand side, put to the back post.
[2538.00 - 2541.00] P:1968.28 E:0.098887 |  The skills of Bufail are absolutely fantastic.
[2541.00 - 2543.00] P:2060.63 E:0.101016 |  Anyway, they get the ball in,
[2543.00 - 2545.00] P:2175.30 E:0.095707 |  I guess it's got to do better, hasn't it?
[2545.00 - 2546.00] P:2204.52 E:0.116140 |  Got to get that on target.
[2546.00 - 2548.00] P:2099.91 E:0.092852 |  It's a header, back post, it's unchallenged,
[2548.00 - 2551.00] P:2134.69 E:0.104376 |  it's not about seven yards out, got to get it on target.
[2551.00 - 2553.00] P:2019.36 E:0.107734 |  Well, he has scored once for Morocco,
[2553.00 - 2557.00] P:1940.50 E:0.094202 |  but that was a huge opportunity to break the deadlock,
[2557.00 - 2559.00] P:1740.08 E:0.095905 |  but two and a half minutes until half-time,
[2559.00 - 2561.00] P:1596.26 E:0.109771 |  a size clears away under pressure.
[2561.00 - 2564.00] P:1810.11 E:0.092700 |  It's still Morocco, Niel, Spain, Niel,
[2564.00 - 2567.00] P:1760.46 E:0.096797 |  good hold-up play by Enna Sirius.
[2567.00 - 2569.00] P:1684.83 E:0.112456 |  Morocco spread it out to the left-hand side
[2569.00 - 2572.00] P:1754.44 E:0.103857 |  and Bufail wants more, urged forward.
[2572.00 - 2574.00] P:1663.38 E:0.102494 |  Has Maserawi on the overlap,
[2574.00 - 2576.00] P:1775.41 E:0.102915 |  here he is, the left back plays the ball into the area,
[2576.00 - 2578.00] P:1682.53 E:0.114901 |  Seymour watches, it's met at the far post,
[2578.00 - 2580.00] P:1832.87 E:0.103885 |  just about cleared away by Spain,
[2580.00 - 2582.00] P:1800.43 E:0.108809 |  once again inside their own six-yard box.
[2582.00 - 2585.00] P:1873.24 E:0.109424 |  All that almost sat up so nicely for Morocco.
[2585.00 - 2588.00] P:1920.39 E:0.116393 |  It's had a play on half-way for a Morocco throw
[2588.00 - 2590.00] P:1880.40 E:0.113773 |  and listened to Education City.
[2590.00 - 2591.00] P:1995.77 E:0.099933 |  Do you know what?
[2591.00 - 2594.00] P:1926.52 E:0.116928 |  Is they don't write off those understandings
[2594.00 - 2596.00] P:1746.98 E:0.117015 |  between the throwbacks and the wingers there.
[2596.00 - 2598.00] P:1792.84 E:0.103289 |  I mean, it's what they all just want in the game,
[2598.00 - 2600.00] P:1624.87 E:0.104399 |  but they have an amazing understanding.
[2600.00 - 2604.00] P:1837.08 E:0.103433 |  I think Bufail is giving the ball away once or twice in this game,
[2604.00 - 2607.00] P:1713.27 E:0.110232 |  but I'm looking at him thinking, it doesn't matter, mate,
[2607.00 - 2608.00] P:1828.96 E:0.121878 |  you've got to get on the ball
[2608.00 - 2611.00] P:1911.25 E:0.111340 |  because you're opening up that defence now in a game.
[2611.00 - 2613.00] P:1786.86 E:0.116474 |  You get a great understanding of your throwback,
[2613.00 - 2617.00] P:1796.38 E:0.117338 |  Maserawi, who's running constantly behind you and beyond you.
[2617.00 - 2620.00] P:1744.02 E:0.112982 |  He's overlapped and he's underlapping as well.
[2620.00 - 2622.00] P:1719.74 E:0.112365 |  They might do it too often, but when they do,
[2622.00 - 2624.00] P:1917.21 E:0.105080 |  it isn't bothering them, they're dead.
[2624.00 - 2626.00] P:1859.30 E:0.103833 |  Here comes Spain, though,
[2626.00 - 2629.00] P:1923.23 E:0.104200 |  central position in field now to Rodgerie in the centre circle.
[2629.00 - 2632.00] P:2097.80 E:0.110020 |  0-0 on five-high BBC sounds
[2632.00 - 2635.00] P:2174.49 E:0.107240 |  and across Africa on the BBC World Service.
[2635.00 - 2637.00] P:2205.65 E:0.095411 |  Here is Llorente,
[2637.00 - 2641.00] P:2185.66 E:0.102179 |  plays it in field once more to La Porte in Spain.
[2641.00 - 2643.00] P:2073.39 E:0.107748 |  We'll just slow things down, and they often do,
[2643.00 - 2647.00] P:2137.24 E:0.102420 |  but I wonder whether this is also slightly a defensive ploy
[2647.00 - 2650.00] P:2199.26 E:0.105853 |  because Morocco have just fashioned a couple of very good chances
[2650.00 - 2652.00] P:2299.68 E:0.100151 |  in the last five minutes.
[2652.00 - 2654.00] P:2239.63 E:0.121064 |  They just impress you the way Morocco,
[2654.00 - 2657.00] P:2322.21 E:0.113531 |  they don't have a lot of the ball, they defend well.
[2657.00 - 2660.00] P:2087.43 E:0.114641 |  Here comes Ferran Torres, though, down the right-hand side,
[2660.00 - 2664.00] P:2014.66 E:0.108484 |  Ball in, looking for a sensio, almost managed to latch onto it.
[2664.00 - 2666.00] P:1914.47 E:0.106954 |  It's well defended at the back by Aguierre,
[2666.00 - 2668.00] P:1820.85 E:0.105317 |  who's missed that chance at the other end.
[2668.00 - 2671.00] P:1960.63 E:0.097798 |  He has fulfilled his defensive duties there, it's the Spain corner.
[2671.00 - 2674.00] P:2095.23 E:0.102917 |  Yep, well done, Spain, turning out the pressure.
[2674.00 - 2677.00] P:2167.03 E:0.107487 |  Taking short, Morocco need to stay switched on,
[2677.00 - 2681.00] P:2084.44 E:0.113197 |  as the ball is swung in right-fitted by Pedri, it's a poor cross,
[2681.00 - 2684.00] P:1806.86 E:0.108586 |  and it's all the way out of play for a Morocco goal kick.
[2684.00 - 2685.00] P:1792.16 E:0.116174 |  0-0.
[2685.00 - 2688.00] P:1789.03 E:0.101468 |  That actually summed up one of the problems with Spain.
[2688.00 - 2691.00] P:1707.59 E:0.100823 |  That was a brilliant ball, into a great area,
[2691.00 - 2694.00] P:1671.96 E:0.096270 |  and there were five Moroccans ushering it out,
[2694.00 - 2697.00] P:1683.05 E:0.099421 |  and there was not one Spaniard attacking the ball.
[2697.00 - 2700.00] P:1799.26 E:0.093303 |  I mean, there's a wide player, you're delighted with that ball.
[2700.00 - 2702.00] P:1737.71 E:0.107464 |  It's between the centre-backs and the goalkeeper,
[2702.00 - 2704.00] P:1560.44 E:0.105585 |  it's zapping with a better goal,
[2704.00 - 2708.00] P:1771.59 E:0.101729 |  but no, not one blue shot, a sky blue shot,
[2708.00 - 2711.00] P:1634.12 E:0.092312 |  attacked that ball, and that's a problem.
[2711.00 - 2718.00] P:1706.70 E:0.095515 |  One minute about a time, at the end of an absorbing, pulsating first half,
[2718.00 - 2720.00] P:1707.43 E:0.085462 |  particularly for Morocco,
[2720.00 - 2723.00] P:1747.55 E:0.085917 |  who will be absolutely delighted with how this has gone,
[2723.00 - 2727.00] P:1666.31 E:0.088353 |  other than perhaps that Aguierre didn't stick that header away a few moments ago,
[2727.00 - 2730.00] P:1619.63 E:0.101617 |  as Bono sends the ball for Morocco.
[2730.00 - 2735.00] P:1810.83 E:0.092418 |  Over the halfway line, the header is won well by Rodgerie,
[2735.00 - 2739.00] P:1842.39 E:0.086918 |  but Morocco will pick it up once more with O'Naghi.
[2739.00 - 2744.00] P:1846.16 E:0.088589 |  Pays it back to the left back, Maserawi,
[2744.00 - 2748.00] P:1783.81 E:0.087763 |  Luis Enrique down there on the touchline, waving his arms.
[2748.00 - 2750.00] P:1743.30 E:0.090191 |  Morocco will be very happy.
[2750.00 - 2753.00] P:1886.99 E:0.092994 |  I don't think Spain will be all that pleased with this first half.
[2753.00 - 2756.00] P:2044.10 E:0.110754 |  They have put together some nice moves, and might do so here.
[2756.00 - 2759.00] P:2078.82 E:0.113555 |  Suddenly it's almost four on three, the Red Shirts getting back.
[2759.00 - 2763.00] P:1929.71 E:0.109590 |  Ammo leaves it, and it's cleared away by Maserawi on the penalty spot.
[2763.00 - 2769.00] P:1918.68 E:0.094744 |  Fine margins, fine, fine margins as the whistle goes for halftime,
[2769.00 - 2774.00] P:1852.10 E:0.104466 |  and Pat that pretty much sums it up for Spain, almost brilliant,
[2774.00 - 2776.00] P:1852.57 E:0.111378 |  but the final ball not quite there,
[2776.00 - 2779.00] P:1686.45 E:0.112005 |  and in truth we haven't seen enough of those moves in this first half.
[2779.00 - 2782.00] P:1674.30 E:0.104638 |  I think on balance, although Spain looked really dangerous in those positions,
[2782.00 - 2784.00] P:1679.23 E:0.094550 |  Morocco have been the better side.
[2784.00 - 2787.00] P:1731.32 E:0.112504 |  In some ways, yeah, I mean, they've got a lot more of possession.
[2787.00 - 2790.00] P:1649.70 E:0.093951 |  If you look at the passing stats, I haven't seen them yet for a while,
[2790.00 - 2795.00] P:1597.04 E:0.101808 |  but they must be passing much, much more than the Moroccans have done.
[2795.00 - 2797.00] P:1603.06 E:0.103954 |  However, the Moroccans have a game plan.
[2797.00 - 2800.00] P:1705.81 E:0.088503 |  The game plan is to defend in a very specific way.
[2800.00 - 2803.00] P:1798.50 E:0.091287 |  It's organised constantly the same way, so it works well.
[2803.00 - 2807.00] P:1770.37 E:0.097529 |  They've only lost one goal in this tournament so far, but boy did they break quickly.
[2807.00 - 2810.00] P:1728.97 E:0.079365 |  And that is a danger, you're right.
[2810.00 - 2815.00] P:1812.25 E:0.092514 |  So a big 45 minutes to come, as Morocco look to reach the quarterfinals
[2815.00 - 2817.00] P:1567.83 E:0.100389 |  for the first time in their history.
[2817.00 - 2821.00] P:1534.46 E:0.094362 |  Spain, the 2010 winners looking to avoid,
[2821.00 - 2823.00] P:1495.89 E:0.092934 |  well, could we even call it an upset?
[2823.00 - 2825.00] P:1608.19 E:0.106964 |  I think we still could, they are still favourites,
[2825.00 - 2829.00] P:1630.20 E:0.094351 |  but Morocco certainly justifying why many people back them
[2829.00 - 2832.00] P:1568.71 E:0.090079 |  to pose real problems for Spain in this tie.
[2832.00 - 2835.00] P:1617.88 E:0.081853 |  Half-time in Education City, it's goalless.
[2835.00 - 2838.00] P:1618.30 E:0.087596 |  Not exactly chance-laden, is it, Pat?
[2838.00 - 2843.00] P:1530.01 E:0.083668 |  I sort of think in many ways the best thing about that first half is the Spanish kit.
[2843.00 - 2848.00] P:1639.92 E:0.096162 |  Well, the Man City kit, which clearly looks like it is just now.
[2848.00 - 2851.00] P:1580.31 E:0.092542 |  I think Pep Guardiola's having an effect here.
[2851.00 - 2855.00] P:1563.79 E:0.101909 |  In all honesty, if there wasn't a phenomenal atmosphere in here,
[2855.00 - 2857.00] P:1673.54 E:0.096208 |  it would be a pretty average game.
[2857.00 - 2860.00] P:1584.54 E:0.105079 |  But it's a game of chess, and I understand what they're doing.
[2860.00 - 2862.00] P:1692.86 E:0.102541 |  And sometimes you get games like the walk-up,
[2862.00 - 2865.00] P:1619.60 E:0.109270 |  they're not always going to be flying here and there,
[2865.00 - 2868.00] P:1774.69 E:0.102455 |  there's not always going to be silky football from the Brazilians.
[2868.00 - 2870.00] P:1645.98 E:0.099821 |  You're going to have ones that are a technical battle,
[2870.00 - 2873.00] P:1637.89 E:0.099411 |  and this is a good high-level technical battle.
[2873.00 - 2875.00] P:1707.04 E:0.114181 |  You know where the weaknesses are.
[2875.00 - 2878.00] P:1660.77 E:0.101601 |  GM was kind enough to tell us beforehand, and he's right.
[2878.00 - 2881.00] P:1612.40 E:0.105972 |  He's absolutely right where the problems are.
[2881.00 - 2884.00] P:1556.56 E:0.110136 |  You can see where the one or two little weaknesses are,
[2884.00 - 2887.00] P:1683.92 E:0.103654 |  where the Moroccans are just about holding on,
[2887.00 - 2890.00] P:1634.31 E:0.091050 |  but there's enough of a story there that they're thinking,
[2890.00 - 2894.00] P:1705.28 E:0.088599 |  hold on to this, technically live slightly by your fingernails,
[2894.00 - 2897.00] P:1538.15 E:0.097256 |  by the first half.
[2897.00 - 2900.00] P:1491.26 E:0.086997 |  But the second half, then change it, then manipulate it,
[2900.00 - 2904.00] P:1599.16 E:0.092724 |  and then make sure you've got the wingers and the fillbacks flying.
[2904.00 - 2907.00] P:1628.40 E:0.096604 |  Because at the moment, if there's one person I want to see on the ball just now,
[2907.00 - 2910.00] P:1676.05 E:0.088830 |  it's Buffal. I'm loving him on the ball.
[2910.00 - 2913.00] P:1462.12 E:0.094176 |  And he gives away none again, but that dummy.
[2913.00 - 2915.00] P:1591.60 E:0.094154 |  You're going to talk about it, aren't you?
[2915.00 - 2919.00] P:1797.07 E:0.088590 |  Well, we are, because as Sebastian Bassop in the studio would be said to be,
[2919.00 - 2923.00] P:1758.34 E:0.106493 |  unfortunately for Laurenti, that's going to be all over YouTube now, forever.
[2923.00 - 2926.00] P:1699.46 E:0.094373 |  Forever, as he said to it for a hot dog.
[2926.00 - 2930.00] P:1642.93 E:0.095911 |  Yeah, it's going to be on YouTube, Instagrammeries and everything.
[2930.00 - 2937.00] P:1362.48 E:0.088238 |  Because the dummy was amazing, but that was a bit of a challenge defending from Laurenti,
[2937.00 - 2939.00] P:1541.10 E:0.076256 |  but I don't take no credit from Buffal.
[2939.00 - 2943.00] P:1490.68 E:0.084425 |  But in terms of this pain, yeah, it's the game is a chess game.
[2943.00 - 2949.00] P:1458.59 E:0.084266 |  Morocco is tactically in place, they're eating on counterattack,
[2949.00 - 2954.00] P:1467.32 E:0.101016 |  and they really make a good use of Buffal and Akim Zeyeshev.
[2954.00 - 2960.00] P:1643.24 E:0.087262 |  I don't know why, but it's going to take a lot from the Spanish touch to break them down.
[2960.00 - 2965.00] P:1648.31 E:0.083368 |  They've almost done it, but it has to be perfect for them to get a goal.
[2965.00 - 2970.00] P:1575.58 E:0.091274 |  You can understand the Moroccan high line and the risk and reward,
[2970.00 - 2973.00] P:1646.61 E:0.093869 |  because it's not that often they get in behind.
[2973.00 - 2978.00] P:1412.13 E:0.094217 |  It's not that often, and if I was a Moroccan player or manager,
[2978.00 - 2983.00] P:1531.16 E:0.087026 |  I would have adopted this tactic, this shape, because that plays in their favour.
[2983.00 - 2988.00] P:1604.17 E:0.086383 |  They know they're not going to have most of the ball, they rather give the ball to Spain
[2988.00 - 2990.00] P:1688.45 E:0.091995 |  and hit them where it hurts.
[2990.00 - 2993.00] P:1540.50 E:0.098646 |  And I think Spain with the time, they've got to be really patient,
[2993.00 - 2998.00] P:1540.92 E:0.093105 |  but they've got to really be careful, because one or twice they've been kind of exposed,
[2998.00 - 3003.00] P:1592.02 E:0.082880 |  and if Moroccans are more efficient going forward, I think they can really hurt Spain.
[3003.00 - 3008.00] P:1859.48 E:0.085971 |  Kian Balagay with us as well, it has panned out as you said it would so far.
[3008.00 - 3011.00] P:1773.59 E:0.090107 |  Yes, and I've just heard of a stat that's an interesting stat,
[3011.00 - 3016.00] P:1677.39 E:0.086489 |  the biggest amount of Cops of T being prepared in the first half of a game in this world cup.
[3016.00 - 3020.00] P:1828.91 E:0.084292 |  You go and nothing happens, Cops back in, still the same kind of stuff.
[3020.00 - 3027.00] P:1688.39 E:0.078297 |  This is the story, I think, as you've been describing of a team waiting for the little gap of a space to be created,
[3027.00 - 3029.00] P:1403.44 E:0.089317 |  and another one just waiting for the mistake.
[3029.00 - 3036.00] P:1595.27 E:0.077180 |  But I feel there's been a tiny little change of dynamics, because it feels like all of a sudden,
[3036.00 - 3039.00] P:1483.24 E:0.073683 |  Morocco starts to feel, how about if we go forward a bit?
[3039.00 - 3043.00] P:1712.08 E:0.075229 |  So they go into the changing room with that question mark left in the air.
[3043.00 - 3047.00] P:1512.32 E:0.082538 |  Will they try to capitalise that, the fact that when they attack things happen?
[3047.00 - 3056.00] P:1767.45 E:0.072244 |  Meanwhile, it hasn't been enough high pace, high rhythm, enough movements for Spain to be dangerous.
[3056.00 - 3061.00] P:1657.36 E:0.087270 |  The only chance that one of us sensed it when he was running behind, that was it.
[3061.00 - 3065.00] P:1634.19 E:0.064990 |  So, yeah, I'm just going to make another look of the team.
[3065.00 - 3069.00] P:1834.71 E:0.095538 |  Well, just before you do, Pater Vicky mentioned it in commentary.
[3069.00 - 3075.00] P:1699.52 E:0.083771 |  Myself and Seb have talked about it here. Spain needs to keep their cool with the ref.
[3075.00 - 3082.00] P:1822.67 E:0.090254 |  It does appear noticeable that the decisions are going more Morocco's way than they are Spain's way.
[3082.00 - 3087.00] P:1585.21 E:0.083082 |  They need to not let that distract them, which is easier said than done.
[3087.00 - 3094.00] P:1609.62 E:0.082284 |  Yeah, they will be worried. All the team for Gabi, I think, who's the one who's most likely to lose it at some point.
[3094.00 - 3100.00] P:1621.43 E:0.079024 |  Everybody else, players that play for Manchester City or Barcelona, they would have been in these situations.
[3100.00 - 3105.00] P:1518.23 E:0.081007 |  It does feel a little bit like every time a Morocco players' fold or a referee falls for it.
[3105.00 - 3108.00] P:1528.21 E:0.075718 |  But in any case, yeah, that should be out of the head.
[3108.00 - 3111.00] P:1628.67 E:0.075158 |  It's about concentrating on moving the ball from side to side.
[3111.00 - 3118.00] P:1635.67 E:0.081548 |  I mean, Pat will tell me, but it did feel like the full backs, Alba on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side,
[3118.00 - 3120.00] P:1559.31 E:0.086944 |  they make a lot of wrongs that were not found.
[3120.00 - 3126.00] P:1681.78 E:0.072327 |  What's the point of making this style when they're supposed to do that and nobody feels brave enough to find that pass?
[3126.00 - 3128.00] P:1734.62 E:0.064842 |  So, it's all very, very predictable.
[3129.00 - 3134.00] P:1813.10 E:0.089352 |  I'll jump in and just say you're right because we'll be talking about, from the first five minutes,
[3134.00 - 3138.00] P:1644.64 E:0.086986 |  the obvious ball that is going to be the Moroccans is there.
[3138.00 - 3139.00] P:1432.47 E:0.097023 |  You can see what it is.
[3139.00 - 3144.00] P:1492.09 E:0.098342 |  They're about 25 yards, 20 yards outside the 18-yard line with the whole line.
[3144.00 - 3148.00] P:1671.14 E:0.084650 |  Javi needs to ask who I mentioned before, they would destroy that.
[3148.00 - 3154.00] P:1728.74 E:0.094518 |  They would just tell that, he said, because they would run across the line and they would give it intelligence to runs.
[3154.00 - 3157.00] P:1774.25 E:0.082376 |  The problem is they've not got quite that quality yet.
[3157.00 - 3161.00] P:1664.86 E:0.101628 |  They will keep on making the runs, I think Alba will keep on making the runs,
[3161.00 - 3163.00] P:1787.02 E:0.096038 |  Ormell will, Torres will.
[3163.00 - 3166.00] P:1691.94 E:0.099190 |  Whereas before, you always knew that ball would arrive.
[3166.00 - 3172.00] P:1829.02 E:0.086594 |  It's not quite that standard yet and that's the weakness, that's the problem with the Spanish at the moment.
[3172.00 - 3180.00] P:1794.79 E:0.097361 |  And just for Pat to finish, Sophie-Anne Bufal's numbers at halftime, 27 touches, 11 duels won,
[3180.00 - 3188.00] P:1777.34 E:0.088529 |  5 take-horns completed, 3 tackles, 3 ball recoveries, 3 crosses attempted and one chance created.
[3188.00 - 3190.00] P:1766.79 E:0.107053 |  He's been the man of that first half.
[3190.00 - 3196.00] P:1838.39 E:0.099420 |  Second half on the way with Pat and Vicky, Sebastian Bassoni, Guillain Balaghea with us as well.
[3196.00 - 3200.00] P:1685.65 E:0.083745 |  Gold us at the break between Morocco and Spain. Here's Jill McKenzie.
[3221.00 - 3224.00] P:1680.29 E:0.083503 |  Labour's Shadow Health Secretary is worth treating.
[3243.00 - 3248.00] P:1513.69 E:0.090969 |  Well, Health Secretary Steve Barclay says his door is open to meet with unions ahead of the strikes.
[3249.00 - 3256.00] P:1529.54 E:0.095780 |  Unions representing rail workers have been urged by the government to not hold the country to ransom after new strikes over Christmas were announced.
[3256.00 - 3263.00] P:1707.58 E:0.077613 |  The RMT boss, Mick Lynch, said he regretted the disruption but blamed ministers for negotiations stalling.
[3263.00 - 3268.00] P:1554.32 E:0.091143 |  The Conservative peer, Baroness Mone, says she's taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords.
[3268.00 - 3276.00] P:1572.08 E:0.088137 |  She denies claims that she lobbied on behalf of a company called PPE Medpro, which won government contracts during the COVID pandemic.
[3276.00 - 3281.00] P:1490.95 E:0.076808 |  Her lawyers have previously said she had no role or function in the company.
[3281.00 - 3287.00] P:1718.54 E:0.090419 |  Nine children across the UK are now known to have died from an illness linked to the bacterial infection, Strep A.
[3287.00 - 3292.00] P:1652.72 E:0.084200 |  The latest victim is a five-year-old from Belfast called Stella Lily Mukhawkendale.
[3292.00 - 3294.00] P:1406.54 E:0.076384 |  Our island correspondent is Chris Page.
[3294.00 - 3302.00] P:1827.89 E:0.086356 |  She was a pupil at Black Mountain Primary School in West Belfast, just a couple of miles from where I am now
[3302.00 - 3311.00] P:1842.30 E:0.084423 |  and the school has paid tribute to her on social media saying she was a bright and talented little girl, very popular and she will be much missed.
[3311.00 - 3318.00] P:1691.28 E:0.087455 |  And a man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of common assault after an egg was allegedly thrown in the direction of King Charles.
[3318.00 - 3324.00] P:1590.66 E:0.084236 |  Bedfordshire Police say the suspect is being questioned after the incident outside Luton Town Hall.
[3333.00 - 3343.00] P:1517.93 E:0.101348 |  The latest travel and the M4 in South Wales, so heading west towards Cardiff to Junction 29 at the A48M with the interchange of vehicle overturned, recoveries underway.
[3343.00 - 3347.00] P:1244.65 E:0.102145 |  There are two lanes closed at the scene and the queues go back to Junction 26 at Malpus Road.
[3347.00 - 3352.00] P:1477.21 E:0.096886 |  The M62 in Manchester west bound queues near the Eccles interchange at Junction 12, a vehicle caught fire.
[3352.00 - 3356.00] P:1254.70 E:0.090135 |  There are two lanes still closed at the scene and it's taking about half an hour.
[3356.00 - 3361.00] P:1406.95 E:0.097429 |  A1M in North Yorkshire, northbound queues heading towards the M1 from 42 at Selby Fork.
[3361.00 - 3363.00] P:873.53 E:0.098948 |  That's a broken down vehicle in one of the lanes.
[3363.00 - 3370.00] P:1109.91 E:0.093957 |  Slow in Oxfordshire, the M40 Southbound at 10 at Brackley, that's a lorry which overturned at the roundabout at the end of the slip road, the exit slip.
[3370.00 - 3378.00] P:1230.14 E:0.095930 |  And also problems on the trains, it's because of the warehouse fire at Wolverhampton so you'll find one of the roads closed as well which is the A454 Wollinall Road,
[3378.00 - 3385.00] P:1350.12 E:0.092588 |  still closed in Wolverhampton in both directions and then it's affecting the trains as well so everything passing through Wolverhampton and Birmingham stations.
[3385.00 - 3387.00] P:1259.39 E:0.093036 |  One of that should be five live travel.
[3397.00 - 3403.00] P:1311.71 E:0.111761 |  Expert analysis and debate with some of the biggest names in football on the World Cup Daily podcast.
[3403.00 - 3409.00] P:1672.61 E:0.111311 |  What Gareth Southgate wants is that they can perform under the most intense pressure they will ever experience.
[3409.00 - 3412.00] P:1714.97 E:0.123403 |  And a bit of fun in match of the day top 10 with Gary Lenaker.
[3412.00 - 3419.00] P:1020.43 E:0.120601 |  Micah Richards is back along with Alan Shearer and myself for the biggest international football tournament on the planet.
[3419.00 - 3423.00] P:1264.91 E:0.103674 |  Take the World Cup with you. Listen on BBC Sounds.
[3423.00 - 3427.00] P:1168.05 E:0.115455 |  BBC Five Live. The FIFA World Cup.
[3427.00 - 3431.00] P:1147.22 E:0.117903 |  Qatar 2022 with Mark Chapman.
[3431.00 - 3437.00] P:1856.17 E:0.079222 |  Morocco nil Spain nil in the latest last 16 game here at the 2022 World Cup.
[3437.00 - 3447.00] P:1900.12 E:0.069834 |  Portugal against Switzerland from seven o'clock tonight here on Five Live and BBC Sounds highlights of both games on BBC One and the iPlayer from just after half 11.
[3447.00 - 3451.00] P:1836.83 E:0.069932 |  This evening a couple of head coaching bits of news for you.
[3451.00 - 3459.00] P:1852.56 E:0.074014 |  The main one being that just nine months before the men's rugby union, World Cup England have sacked head coach Eddie Jones.
[3459.00 - 3466.00] P:1862.18 E:0.070885 |  And the other one being that Michael O'Neill has reportedly agreed to deal to become the Northern Ireland manager for the second time.
[3466.00 - 3471.00] P:1842.93 E:0.057358 |  An official announcement is expected later this week.
[3471.00 - 3479.00] P:1854.09 E:0.073290 |  Now England's quarterfinal against France is of course on Five Live and BBC Sounds from seven o'clock this Saturday evening.
[3479.00 - 3486.00] P:1745.25 E:0.068801 |  All the talk during the tournament has been about Kylian Mbappe got two in their three won win over Poland.
[3486.00 - 3488.00] P:2035.84 E:0.066278 |  So he's the tournament's top scorer.
[3488.00 - 3493.00] P:1920.84 E:0.081300 |  Olivier Giroud became France's all-time leading male goal scorer in that game.
[3493.00 - 3497.00] P:1755.64 E:0.065587 |  But today even he couldn't avoid talking about his teammate.
[3497.00 - 3504.00] P:1455.58 E:0.084629 |  He's amazing and he's still young, which is scary because he still can improve his game.
[3504.00 - 3514.00] P:1412.70 E:0.086359 |  But he's very efficient, you know, and from the beginning of the competition, he's been crucial for us.
[3514.00 - 3521.00] P:1131.19 E:0.076966 |  He's obviously the best striker I play with and all the teams I play.
[3521.00 - 3526.00] P:1108.31 E:0.086274 |  But yeah, we still have not seen the best of Kylian.
[3526.00 - 3531.00] P:1542.44 E:0.087245 |  I hope it's going to come soon and it will beat all the records.
[3531.00 - 3535.00] P:877.40 E:0.091110 |  So I know that, you know also.
[3535.00 - 3539.00] P:1328.24 E:0.071685 |  So I think he's unbelievable.
[3539.00 - 3544.00] P:1236.64 E:0.083820 |  Your thoughts on this current England team, are you surprised by how they've played here?
[3544.00 - 3547.00] P:1083.80 E:0.089803 |  So far they are the good tournaments.
[3547.00 - 3551.00] P:1441.91 E:0.080859 |  I hope they will have a tough game on Saturday.
[3551.00 - 3560.00] P:1081.17 E:0.087595 |  And I know very well this team and we were talking with Hugo regarding this game and we said,
[3560.00 - 3563.00] P:629.67 E:0.104095 |  we don't want to lose against England.
[3563.00 - 3570.00] P:1310.76 E:0.083963 |  That's a special game for us, but yeah, they have quality but quantity also in the squad.
[3570.00 - 3573.00] P:1042.23 E:0.091811 |  So it will be a nice game to watch.
[3573.00 - 3579.00] P:1076.89 E:0.091579 |  I think interesting and I hope it's going to go well for us.
[3579.00 - 3587.00] P:1760.17 E:0.076631 |  Olivier Giroud there, but Sarah Menet, French football journalist, Kylian Mbappe has not trained today.
[3587.00 - 3591.00] P:1615.47 E:0.062711 |  Good afternoon Mark.
[3591.00 - 3597.00] P:1868.59 E:0.066847 |  Yes, we understand he was not part of collective training earlier in the afternoon,
[3597.00 - 3599.00] P:1474.76 E:0.072635 |  but no major concern.
[3599.00 - 3604.00] P:1691.15 E:0.066549 |  He took part in an indoor individual training in the gym.
[3604.00 - 3607.00] P:1714.61 E:0.088101 |  So no major concern for him.
[3607.00 - 3612.00] P:1611.68 E:0.070997 |  He has been complaining about a Nenco from time to time at the start of the World Cup.
[3612.00 - 3616.00] P:1606.16 E:0.066249 |  So nothing serious, but he's been complaining a little bit about his uncle.
[3616.00 - 3621.00] P:1839.71 E:0.064856 |  Pity the poor French press officer.
[3621.00 - 3629.00] P:1757.13 E:0.095630 |  When he or she found out there was going to be no Mbappe at training and realised what was about to come their way.
[3629.00 - 3631.00] P:1660.12 E:0.077798 |  What am I going to do?
[3631.00 - 3634.00] P:1712.47 E:0.065122 |  Oh my God, what do you do with that?
[3634.00 - 3638.00] P:1743.70 E:0.080887 |  Do you know what the mood is like within that French squad?
[3638.00 - 3643.00] P:1936.14 E:0.062228 |  Very good mood, we understand there's a very good mood, there's a very good team spirit.
[3643.00 - 3647.00] P:1751.57 E:0.073542 |  I think that's one of the strengths of DDA Digchamps management.
[3647.00 - 3655.00] P:1675.87 E:0.074861 |  The team, even the guys who are not playing, even the guys who know they will probably spend the rest of the competition on the bench,
[3655.00 - 3658.00] P:1863.72 E:0.076501 |  are taking parts into celebrations.
[3658.00 - 3665.00] P:1708.15 E:0.073462 |  I think everybody's living well together and they're obviously getting ready for Saturday's big game.
[3665.00 - 3670.00] P:1865.30 E:0.065315 |  The work started this morning because yesterday they had a bit of a break.
[3670.00 - 3674.00] P:1813.54 E:0.080599 |  DDA Digchamps for the first time in an international competition,
[3674.00 - 3682.00] P:1964.64 E:0.060174 |  offerised the players' families and the staff families to come and visit the players after the qualification against Poland.
[3682.00 - 3689.00] P:1637.50 E:0.069770 |  So they've seen their wives and their kids a little bit and work started this morning to get ready for that big clash against England on Saturday.
[3689.00 - 3691.00] P:2023.46 E:0.093120 |  Good stuff, Sarah. Thank you very much Camilla.
[3691.00 - 3694.00] P:1938.82 E:0.063459 |  Sarah Meneu, French football journalist.
[3694.00 - 3699.00] P:1754.85 E:0.076976 |  There will obviously be a lot of talk about England against France ahead of Saturday's quarterfinal,
[3699.00 - 3703.00] P:1880.88 E:0.065923 |  which you will hear with us here on Five Live.
[3703.00 - 3709.00] P:1812.24 E:0.075919 |  Second half about to get back underway at the Education City Stadium, back to Pat and Vicki.
[3709.00 - 3717.00] P:1785.07 E:0.095625 |  Perfect timing mark, we have just kicked off and it is Morocco in the red shirt, the dark green shorts,
[3717.00 - 3719.00] P:1540.19 E:0.101839 |  and the red socks that get us underway.
[3719.00 - 3724.00] P:1702.27 E:0.096398 |  The light blue shirts, the white shorts and the light blue socks.
[3724.00 - 3728.00] P:1707.39 E:0.102416 |  No changes made by either manager at half-time, Pat.
[3728.00 - 3732.00] P:1947.89 E:0.082584 |  So what are we expecting for this second half?
[3732.00 - 3737.00] P:2025.97 E:0.101599 |  What I'm expecting and what I'm hoping for, maybe we'll be able to do different things.
[3737.00 - 3742.00] P:2188.74 E:0.105891 |  If any team, either team could score a goal here, this game will completely change and we'll open up.
[3742.00 - 3751.00] P:2160.22 E:0.096499 |  It will become more end-to-end, but it's settled into a very odd pattern, where controlled by Manchester.
[3751.00 - 3755.00] P:2010.29 E:0.111614 |  Well, it's Roger in possession in a light blue shirt, isn't it?
[3755.00 - 3756.00] P:1674.69 E:0.105462 |  To the ports.
[3756.00 - 3761.00] P:2058.96 E:0.107383 |  And they're playing exactly like a pet Guardiola team.
[3761.00 - 3763.00] P:2158.62 E:0.097300 |  But it's exactly what it's like.
[3763.00 - 3766.00] P:2188.12 E:0.093296 |  But they need to change it slightly.
[3766.00 - 3773.00] P:2245.76 E:0.095490 |  If you're Spain, you need to change this slightly because you're actually falling into the trap of the Moroccans.
[3773.00 - 3774.00] P:2218.97 E:0.094081 |  I actually think you are.
[3774.00 - 3778.00] P:2274.39 E:0.103854 |  And the Moroccans will just, I think, get stronger and better as game goes on.
[3778.00 - 3781.00] P:1967.44 E:0.096325 |  So Spain haven't got out of their own half yet, having won back possession.
[3781.00 - 3784.00] P:2127.36 E:0.093425 |  They're passing it along that back four.
[3784.00 - 3788.00] P:2052.47 E:0.101959 |  We'll take you through the line-ups in a moment, but now they just go through the gear span.
[3788.00 - 3789.00] P:2008.84 E:0.099937 |  They've gone backwards again.
[3789.00 - 3791.00] P:2019.45 E:0.105156 |  So Bono in goal for Morocco.
[3791.00 - 3793.00] P:2083.71 E:0.094678 |  And the goal for Akemi.
[3793.00 - 3795.00] P:1943.64 E:0.080645 |  Aged, Saiz.
[3795.00 - 3796.00] P:1620.68 E:0.120448 |  And Masrawi.
[3796.00 - 3799.00] P:1807.74 E:0.098150 |  A Spain winner free kick just outside the Morocco penalty area.
[3799.00 - 3803.00] P:1839.62 E:0.087994 |  Nahi, Amrabat and Amala ahead of them.
[3803.00 - 3808.00] P:1941.83 E:0.079956 |  Ziesh, Boufal and Nasseri up front.
[3808.00 - 3810.00] P:1913.76 E:0.118018 |  Nice little bit of play there, but Ferran Torres.
[3810.00 - 3812.00] P:2070.18 E:0.083087 |  You've not seen enough of that yet.
[3812.00 - 3817.00] P:2055.79 E:0.100942 |  He stood up, he's defender, caught baston with a really nice little knockback.
[3817.00 - 3819.00] P:2098.75 E:0.107044 |  Then kept his run going.
[3819.00 - 3824.00] P:2122.64 E:0.099377 |  That's the question of Masrawi, which you haven't done that often in the game so far.
[3824.00 - 3827.00] P:2282.24 E:0.108291 |  So maybe Lewis and Ricky said, right, the change is,
[3827.00 - 3830.00] P:2319.68 E:0.104292 |  to you, Akemi, going to take a full-back for once.
[3830.00 - 3834.00] P:2211.77 E:0.104595 |  It's not happening the first half, it's now happening in the second.
[3834.00 - 3836.00] P:2047.29 E:0.115420 |  So a two-player Morocco wall.
[3836.00 - 3838.00] P:2052.99 E:0.102842 |  Bono has just told Amrabat.
[3838.00 - 3840.00] P:2099.38 E:0.111120 |  It looked like he was saying go join the wall,
[3840.00 - 3843.00] P:2149.22 E:0.106913 |  but Amrabat has taken up a position just on the edge of the penalty area.
[3843.00 - 3846.00] P:2121.02 E:0.102830 |  Spain knocked the free kick around between them, now goes into the area,
[3846.00 - 3850.00] P:1721.98 E:0.107783 |  headed away well by Nasseri, the tall striker back there for Morocco.
[3850.00 - 3852.00] P:1845.01 E:0.090371 |  And the ball goes out of play for Spain.
[3852.00 - 3855.00] P:1814.23 E:0.105768 |  Spain is Cimón in goal, the back four of Llorente, right back,
[3855.00 - 3857.00] P:1998.32 E:0.092599 |  Rodri, La Porte and Albert.
[3857.00 - 3862.00] P:2017.18 E:0.096294 |  Gavi, Bousquets, the only survivor of that 2010 World Cup win.
[3862.00 - 3867.00] P:2050.81 E:0.089300 |  And Pedri in the midfield with Torres, Almo and Asensio up front,
[3867.00 - 3870.00] P:2105.80 E:0.098246 |  as Uthrow goes all the way back to Rodri.
[3870.00 - 3872.00] P:2210.07 E:0.102921 |  Midway through the Morocco half,
[3872.00 - 3875.00] P:2182.14 E:0.106216 |  and now Spain will work it back to La Porte on the edge of the centre circle.
[3875.00 - 3877.00] P:2176.89 E:0.094491 |  That's the thing for Spain.
[3877.00 - 3880.00] P:2178.70 E:0.101319 |  The attacking powers that they have on the bench, if they need to change it,
[3880.00 - 3883.00] P:2117.28 E:0.107519 |  if it stays nil-nil, they've got the players to bring on and do that.
[3883.00 - 3885.00] P:2287.01 E:0.112706 |  You're reading my mind, aren't you?
[3885.00 - 3890.00] P:2197.24 E:0.103239 |  But I'm just looking and thinking, surely Marató has got to be a decision at some point
[3890.00 - 3894.00] P:2234.20 E:0.108170 |  because his score's goals, he's also a striker, it's a set of following.
[3894.00 - 3897.00] P:2069.82 E:0.108821 |  Again, almost from Spain, Almo into Asensio,
[3897.00 - 3900.00] P:1790.66 E:0.099782 |  the ball is cleared away for a Spain throw.
[3900.00 - 3902.00] P:1793.94 E:0.105927 |  And Morocco aren't very happy about that.
[3902.00 - 3905.00] P:1880.23 E:0.092298 |  They felt that Spain have got the final touch on that ball,
[3905.00 - 3906.00] P:1938.86 E:0.106749 |  but it is a throw for Spain.
[3906.00 - 3910.00] P:2038.13 E:0.103825 |  Jordi Alba will take it level with the penalty spot on the left-hand side.
[3910.00 - 3914.00] P:2014.74 E:0.103503 |  Nil-nil here on 5-Live, BBC Sounds, and across Africa on the World Service.
[3914.00 - 3918.00] P:1765.53 E:0.107481 |  As Almo is dispossessed, and Zee Esch now will pick it up down the right-hand side,
[3918.00 - 3919.00] P:1891.57 E:0.111456 |  and he's roared forward.
[3919.00 - 3923.00] P:1861.07 E:0.101930 |  Zee Esch cutting in field, played the ball forward just too much on it,
[3923.00 - 3927.00] P:1882.72 E:0.096574 |  intercepted at the back by La Porte and all the way back by Jordi Alba.
[3927.00 - 3931.00] P:1713.37 E:0.109732 |  Seamon then closed down under pressure inside his own area, does clear,
[3931.00 - 3935.00] P:1787.02 E:0.103142 |  but only as far as Amrabat, as they come forward once more, Morocco.
[3935.00 - 3940.00] P:1801.16 E:0.103308 |  Trying to trick his way into the penalty area is Amala, cleared away by Spain.
[3940.00 - 3942.00] P:1964.92 E:0.096523 |  And they win the free kick as well.
[3942.00 - 3944.00] P:1743.26 E:0.098131 |  Well, end to end there, Pat, for a moment.
[3944.00 - 3945.00] P:1382.37 E:0.115224 |  Yeah, for a moment.
[3945.00 - 3947.00] P:1703.04 E:0.100641 |  I mean, that's a lot more interesting.
[3947.00 - 3951.00] P:1862.53 E:0.088878 |  The ball that was brilliantly actually right to start from Zee Esch,
[3951.00 - 3954.00] P:1862.41 E:0.101546 |  she gets about 50-60 yards there, running with good pace,
[3954.00 - 3957.00] P:1920.68 E:0.099480 |  cut sensei, there's a ball right to Buffal.
[3957.00 - 3959.00] P:1956.57 E:0.102067 |  He doesn't play it.
[3959.00 - 3963.00] P:1931.60 E:0.110010 |  If he plays that ball, Buffal's got one-on-one, and he can attack the goalkeeper.
[3963.00 - 3967.00] P:1918.23 E:0.107610 |  So, from Morocco, they broke very well, broke very quickly,
[3967.00 - 3971.00] P:1988.65 E:0.090480 |  as they tend to last ballplayed, the session wasn't clear.
[3973.00 - 3975.00] P:1891.18 E:0.120637 |  Spain in possession on the halfway line.
[3975.00 - 3978.00] P:1842.57 E:0.106508 |  You know, now you've said Manchester City, I'm having to concentrate so hard,
[3978.00 - 3979.00] P:1975.41 E:0.104612 |  and not say that.
[3979.00 - 3981.00] P:2028.33 E:0.106613 |  But he's Spain into the penalty area.
[3981.00 - 3985.00] P:2147.59 E:0.108640 |  Ascensio, left-hand side, full start of the box, good defending by Morocco.
[3985.00 - 3986.00] P:2184.13 E:0.115311 |  Olmó will pick it up.
[3986.00 - 3989.00] P:2343.13 E:0.110195 |  Now all the way back with Jordi Alba as the whistle starts again.
[3989.00 - 3993.00] P:2229.53 E:0.111240 |  Here is Rodri, just stepping forward a little bit more from that centre half position.
[3993.00 - 3996.00] P:2098.22 E:0.107796 |  Pedri plays it to Llorente, out to the right-hand side,
[3996.00 - 4000.00] P:1913.57 E:0.101173 |  where Ferran Torres waits, and the flag eventually goes up.
[4000.00 - 4003.00] P:1786.45 E:0.099913 |  He was well challenged in the end, but the flag is up for offside.
[4003.00 - 4005.00] P:1640.76 E:0.109683 |  0-0, five minutes gone in the second half.
[4006.00 - 4008.00] P:1769.26 E:0.111431 |  Yeah, much better actually.
[4008.00 - 4010.00] P:1774.58 E:0.091834 |  Well, it's a much better, a bit better.
[4010.00 - 4012.00] P:1711.38 E:0.102056 |  Certainly a bit better was in the first half.
[4012.00 - 4016.00] P:1804.02 E:0.097886 |  The good thing about Spain is actually they're moving it a little bit quicker through,
[4016.00 - 4020.00] P:1729.56 E:0.105772 |  you know, the zones that they feel with the forehand, it was far too slow,
[4020.00 - 4023.00] P:1666.46 E:0.100004 |  it was around the back line, it was giving the Moroccans plenty of time
[4023.00 - 4026.00] P:1750.35 E:0.098480 |  to get men behind the ball, but also get their structure right.
[4026.00 - 4029.00] P:1715.22 E:0.094178 |  At the moment, Spain are moving it a little bit quicker now.
[4029.00 - 4032.00] P:1742.27 E:0.095203 |  I suspect Luis Ramos has had a word with it.
[4032.00 - 4035.00] P:1864.70 E:0.096235 |  You know, if you keep on doing this, you'll end up at penalty kicks,
[4035.00 - 4037.00] P:1797.24 E:0.097484 |  and do they really want that?
[4038.00 - 4042.00] P:1758.48 E:0.096864 |  Bono takes this free kick from Morocco over the halfway line.
[4042.00 - 4045.00] P:1728.73 E:0.087142 |  They certainly won't want it, Spain, but I tell you what,
[4045.00 - 4048.00] P:1656.47 E:0.096659 |  those players are better be prepared, because Luis Enrique in the build-up to this
[4048.00 - 4052.00] P:1868.69 E:0.101578 |  saying that he'd given the Spanish players homework over a year ago at a Spain training camp.
[4052.00 - 4058.00] P:2262.63 E:0.105392 |  He wanted them to get here to the World Cup, having taken over at least a thousand penalties
[4058.00 - 4060.00] P:2205.71 E:0.106082 |  in practice at their clubs.
[4060.00 - 4064.00] P:2187.56 E:0.108648 |  So I hope he's got tallies of them, and everyone had to hand in the sheets
[4064.00 - 4068.00] P:1987.74 E:0.104392 |  of when they did it and where they did it, as Morocco concedes the free kick
[4068.00 - 4074.00] P:1819.17 E:0.097116 |  and it's Hakimi's turn to get frustrated with Gavi, rather than the other way around, Spain free kick.
[4074.00 - 4077.00] P:1887.45 E:0.093675 |  Yeah, I think penalties have been, well, they have been important already,
[4077.00 - 4081.00] P:2049.89 E:0.094845 |  and if you look to the first two particular penalty kicks on Japanese,
[4081.00 - 4085.00] P:2087.45 E:0.103481 |  the other night, I mean, absolutely awful, like I've got a cheat.
[4086.00 - 4089.00] P:2179.13 E:0.112930 |  That wasn't the best penalty kick taker, but there are certain players
[4089.00 - 4094.00] P:2219.37 E:0.106058 |  who just don't think I've switched it in the jab, and you can't look like it at all.
[4094.00 - 4098.00] P:2102.95 E:0.098800 |  Morocco clear the ball up towards half-way, the header is won by Rodri,
[4098.00 - 4101.00] P:2088.28 E:0.099325 |  and out to the right-hand side it goes.
[4101.00 - 4107.00] P:2193.17 E:0.105866 |  Back to Rodri once more, and now La Porte, Spain moving over the halfway line,
[4107.00 - 4110.00] P:1901.71 E:0.098552 |  trying to ease through the gears, but it's well intercepted by Zee Esch,
[4110.00 - 4113.00] P:1733.10 E:0.098940 |  and Morocco will bring the ball away. We have to say Zee Esch is Hakimi,
[4113.00 - 4116.00] P:1774.65 E:0.100732 |  thought he was pulled back there and eventually does get the free kick.
[4116.00 - 4120.00] P:1866.39 E:0.104038 |  He's forced the referee's hand there, hasn't he? And Luis Enrique is absolutely furious,
[4120.00 - 4124.00] P:1846.35 E:0.101224 |  because it was a real tussle for Hakimi, he's decided to stop and say,
[4124.00 - 4127.00] P:1777.19 E:0.109652 |  and he does have his arm, to be fair, but...
[4127.00 - 4132.00] P:1961.02 E:0.108174 |  So does Hakimi, he's one of those ones who gave the decision now.
[4132.00 - 4135.00] P:1904.11 E:0.114309 |  I don't think it was the referee who gave the decision,
[4135.00 - 4139.00] P:1924.34 E:0.098977 |  but once again, it's a durian, the Spanish players,
[4139.00 - 4142.00] P:1847.44 E:0.102694 |  but they just cannot let it get to him, they cannot let it affect him.
[4142.00 - 4145.00] P:1850.22 E:0.095157 |  Yeah, I think the Spain boss Luis Enrique increased with you as well,
[4145.00 - 4149.00] P:1812.06 E:0.099120 |  passed as the free kick is wasted by a Gehrz,
[4149.00 - 4154.00] P:1658.64 E:0.091390 |  outs over to the left-hand side, but straight out of play for a Spain throw.
[4154.00 - 4160.00] P:1738.03 E:0.094474 |  Do you notice like in games like this, you look at 55, 60 minutes and think,
[4160.00 - 4163.00] P:1650.93 E:0.105748 |  right, okay, think we make some changes, if it's not going your way,
[4163.00 - 4166.00] P:1811.35 E:0.103773 |  you know, either team can consider it, maybe more Spain,
[4166.00 - 4171.00] P:1968.72 E:0.099905 |  and we'd say maybe more Spain, I think they're the more likely to make the quicker substitutions,
[4171.00 - 4175.00] P:2181.30 E:0.108296 |  but with your mind on the fact that it could be 30 more minutes,
[4175.00 - 4178.00] P:2357.29 E:0.107609 |  and you want to keep your penalty kick takers on there,
[4178.00 - 4181.00] P:2345.26 E:0.120623 |  there's a lot to be taken into account before you make those decisions.
[4181.00 - 4186.00] P:2238.32 E:0.101968 |  Long way to go, Spain in possession on this left-hand side,
[4186.00 - 4188.00] P:2325.35 E:0.102906 |  eight minutes gone in this second half,
[4188.00 - 4193.00] P:2107.76 E:0.109376 |  Nil Nil on five-life BBC sounds in across Africa on the BBC World Service now,
[4193.00 - 4198.00] P:1849.77 E:0.093642 |  Hakimi has brought down Gavi there, just outside the penalty area,
[4198.00 - 4201.00] P:1680.29 E:0.107765 |  and he's on the left-hand side, he's protesting his innocence there, Hakimi.
[4201.00 - 4205.00] P:1970.20 E:0.082187 |  I wouldn't have given that, I still wouldn't give that.
[4205.00 - 4208.00] P:2012.15 E:0.106840 |  He's actually thrown his right leg into the defender,
[4208.00 - 4212.00] P:2052.51 E:0.096618 |  defenders try to get away, and he's thrown his leg forward.
[4212.00 - 4214.00] P:2171.75 E:0.094091 |  It's one of those ones, if you're a defender, you think,
[4214.00 - 4217.00] P:2099.14 E:0.097426 |  what can I do, I'm just running along?
[4217.00 - 4218.00] P:2158.29 E:0.112273 |  I think that's the point he's making.
[4218.00 - 4221.00] P:1906.44 E:0.095371 |  Yep, exactly that point to Sergio Brasquez,
[4221.00 - 4224.00] P:2011.19 E:0.087338 |  a Spain trier, cheeky one, and take the free kick quickly,
[4224.00 - 4226.00] P:1946.05 E:0.099580 |  but the referee isn't happy with that,
[4226.00 - 4229.00] P:2047.80 E:0.107184 |  I know I'm still organising the wall and having a conversation,
[4229.00 - 4232.00] P:2142.30 E:0.105694 |  so it will have to be a little bit more orthodox for Spain,
[4232.00 - 4237.00] P:2216.02 E:0.109242 |  who have Dani Olmo and Marco Asensio over this wide-left position,
[4237.00 - 4240.00] P:2172.45 E:0.116939 |  Nil Nil, nine minutes gone in the second half,
[4240.00 - 4242.00] P:2187.23 E:0.112455 |  all the red shirts that they're defending from Morocco,
[4242.00 - 4248.00] P:2182.43 E:0.109252 |  two-player wall, and the light blue shirts of Spain away,
[4248.00 - 4250.00] P:1970.47 E:0.115992 |  so it's laid off to Dani Olmo, who went for goal,
[4250.00 - 4254.00] P:1882.67 E:0.105111 |  and Bono gets two big fists behind it and punches it away.
[4254.00 - 4257.00] P:1822.03 E:0.099991 |  Well, we're far away, Pat, I think you can see the look of surprise
[4257.00 - 4260.00] P:1824.90 E:0.098602 |  from here from Bono, but he did stand up well to it,
[4260.00 - 4263.00] P:1877.05 E:0.093946 |  and that was a little bit of ingenuity from Spain there.
[4263.00 - 4267.00] P:2086.78 E:0.100477 |  Yep, much, much livelier, they've moved it a little bit quicker,
[4267.00 - 4269.00] P:2205.26 E:0.112852 |  unexpected, something else to be working in,
[4269.00 - 4272.00] P:2196.70 E:0.109964 |  and the training ground, but it was straight out the goalkeeper,
[4272.00 - 4275.00] P:2218.19 E:0.103719 |  and it's one of those ones, it looks like you've had your letter
[4275.00 - 4277.00] P:2269.49 E:0.105284 |  and you've hammered them.
[4277.00 - 4280.00] P:2067.99 E:0.102111 |  That's true, Asensio tries the little back heel,
[4280.00 - 4283.00] P:1953.01 E:0.099772 |  looking for the run of Ferran Torres, cleared away by Morocco,
[4283.00 - 4289.00] P:1969.39 E:0.084118 |  and the ball goes out of play for a throw, which Rodri will take.
[4289.00 - 4292.00] P:2038.54 E:0.098664 |  They have already held Croatia at this tournament.
[4292.00 - 4296.00] P:2129.67 E:0.098188 |  Morocco, they scored two late goals to beat Belgium,
[4296.00 - 4298.00] P:2179.33 E:0.083069 |  two clean sheets into the bargain.
[4298.00 - 4302.00] P:2270.35 E:0.102194 |  They won that group, beat in Canada in their final match,
[4302.00 - 4305.00] P:2102.77 E:0.092122 |  Spain finishing runners-up to Japan,
[4305.00 - 4307.00] P:2114.60 E:0.100399 |  but it's Spain in possession,
[4307.00 - 4311.00] P:2076.84 E:0.089084 |  and Spain, who 10 minutes gone in this second half,
[4311.00 - 4314.00] P:2157.70 E:0.109793 |  are just looking a little bit more in control now
[4314.00 - 4316.00] P:2180.87 E:0.101370 |  and a little bit more dangerous.
[4318.00 - 4321.00] P:2116.27 E:0.112043 |  Rodri finds the ports on the halfway line, who is Gavi,
[4321.00 - 4323.00] P:2128.48 E:0.101790 |  but this is what they do, Spain.
[4323.00 - 4327.00] P:2075.60 E:0.098940 |  There's a lull and a wave, and then a lull will come again,
[4327.00 - 4330.00] P:1873.03 E:0.106179 |  but now the blue wave is coming forward down the left-hand side,
[4330.00 - 4333.00] P:1962.10 E:0.107559 |  and Akimi, who had intercepted, has been dispossessed by Olmo.
[4333.00 - 4337.00] P:1912.71 E:0.101929 |  Akimi gets back in, Olmo goes down, no free kick given.
[4337.00 - 4340.00] P:1813.97 E:0.103754 |  Olmo doesn't really protest on the edge of the penalty area.
[4340.00 - 4342.00] P:1660.31 E:0.116429 |  He did have a look at the referee, who says no,
[4342.00 - 4344.00] P:1748.48 E:0.107424 |  and now Amrabat over the halfway line,
[4344.00 - 4347.00] P:1792.94 E:0.102243 |  and the flag goes up very quickly against Enesiri,
[4347.00 - 4349.00] P:1680.02 E:0.112271 |  and he did look offside there,
[4349.00 - 4351.00] P:1782.42 E:0.105534 |  and that's real frustration for Morocco,
[4351.00 - 4354.00] P:1816.67 E:0.094080 |  because that was the right ball, but Enesiri didn't hold his run,
[4354.00 - 4356.00] P:1980.73 E:0.087387 |  and that could have been a real chance.
[4356.00 - 4359.00] P:1990.65 E:0.102297 |  That is the game plan in a second,
[4359.00 - 4361.00] P:1897.94 E:0.105800 |  and it showed you they're breaking ground there.
[4361.00 - 4362.00] P:1745.89 E:0.122365 |  They're doing it again now.
[4362.00 - 4364.00] P:1791.32 E:0.112099 |  They're coming forward again down the left-hand side.
[4364.00 - 4366.00] P:1761.29 E:0.094759 |  Enesiri waits in the centre,
[4366.00 - 4369.00] P:1657.21 E:0.111727 |  challenge on the edge of the area, referee again,
[4369.00 - 4370.00] P:1833.10 E:0.102119 |  lets it go.
[4370.00 - 4373.00] P:1951.69 E:0.114857 |  This time it goes Spain's way, but foul going down.
[4373.00 - 4376.00] P:2164.36 E:0.099131 |  As was Masraoui, the left back.
[4376.00 - 4378.00] P:2191.21 E:0.113177 |  The two of them working it down that left-hand side.
[4378.00 - 4381.00] P:2189.53 E:0.106283 |  Might have been a handball in the end from Morocco too,
[4381.00 - 4385.00] P:2206.91 E:0.108423 |  and we play on Spain in possession with Jordi Alba.
[4385.00 - 4389.00] P:2179.43 E:0.099827 |  Goes in field to Biscuits, out to the right-hand side,
[4389.00 - 4392.00] P:2078.13 E:0.088505 |  and now Ferrantores under pressure,
[4392.00 - 4394.00] P:1829.12 E:0.099519 |  and under that pressure, won't keep it in,
[4394.00 - 4397.00] P:1749.46 E:0.093117 |  and it's a throw to Morocco, nil-nil.
[4397.00 - 4400.00] P:1788.76 E:0.080563 |  The way they're playing, it's like if it was...
[4400.00 - 4404.00] P:1757.86 E:0.098896 |  If the national team was on something from the Animal Kingdom,
[4404.00 - 4405.00] P:1697.64 E:0.102376 |  they'd be a cobra.
[4405.00 - 4408.00] P:1787.85 E:0.099919 |  They just sit there and sit there and they hold that,
[4408.00 - 4410.00] P:1626.60 E:0.113807 |  and then they strike with brilliant, brilliant pace,
[4410.00 - 4413.00] P:1745.10 E:0.106210 |  and they know what they're doing, they're just waiting.
[4413.00 - 4416.00] P:1695.49 E:0.102984 |  The more this is going on, the more I'm impressed.
[4416.00 - 4420.00] P:1673.39 E:0.094988 |  By then, yes, the Spanish have got more of the ball,
[4420.00 - 4422.00] P:1819.27 E:0.091531 |  but the way that they're breaking down,
[4422.00 - 4425.00] P:1692.80 E:0.103462 |  it's as if they're just growing and growing and growing into it.
[4425.00 - 4428.00] P:1736.94 E:0.093880 |  It's exactly what they've done against the Belgians.
[4428.00 - 4433.00] P:1681.26 E:0.107081 |  It's so brave to do that, to allow that much possession away,
[4433.00 - 4436.00] P:1689.17 E:0.103977 |  and it feels like they're going to get at least one or two chances
[4436.00 - 4438.00] P:1743.08 E:0.098169 |  before the end of this game in the Moroccans.
[4438.00 - 4439.00] P:1748.04 E:0.072747 |  Can they take them?
[4439.00 - 4441.00] P:1546.52 E:0.112898 |  Throw to Morocco on the far side as their manager,
[4441.00 - 4446.00] P:1592.79 E:0.094339 |  Walid Regragi, stands, arms folded in his black suits
[4446.00 - 4449.00] P:1740.70 E:0.096765 |  and white trainers on the edge of his technical area.
[4449.00 - 4452.00] P:1622.77 E:0.096248 |  They've advanced a few more yards with another throw.
[4452.00 - 4455.00] P:1731.19 E:0.093502 |  Still unbeaten under Regragi, as we mentioned earlier,
[4455.00 - 4458.00] P:1760.34 E:0.094423 |  he's only been in charge since the end of August.
[4458.00 - 4461.00] P:1700.81 E:0.089356 |  Six games, four wins, including against Belgium,
[4461.00 - 4464.00] P:1826.18 E:0.091123 |  two draws, including against Croatia.
[4464.00 - 4468.00] P:1724.46 E:0.080295 |  They are going from strength to strength in this tournament,
[4468.00 - 4473.00] P:1830.84 E:0.098150 |  and they once again are giving a very good account of themselves,
[4473.00 - 4475.00] P:1964.54 E:0.106928 |  Morocco, nil-nil with Spain.
[4475.00 - 4478.00] P:1907.55 E:0.090181 |  The Spain have it just outside their own penalty area.
[4478.00 - 4481.00] P:1813.04 E:0.094227 |  Pedri Spindbott down, so they'll have a free kick a few yards up now.
[4481.00 - 4484.00] P:1902.03 E:0.101862 |  Zee Esch, there's no need to do that there.
[4484.00 - 4486.00] P:1886.30 E:0.089515 |  Spain had bowled the ball up with Jordi Alba
[4486.00 - 4488.00] P:1887.75 E:0.094809 |  to where the free kick was going to be taken from,
[4488.00 - 4490.00] P:2023.25 E:0.096708 |  and Zee Esch just kicked it backwards,
[4490.00 - 4492.00] P:2055.65 E:0.099367 |  so referee's happy to let it go,
[4492.00 - 4494.00] P:2178.03 E:0.110972 |  and it all simmers down into nothing,
[4494.00 - 4499.00] P:2253.30 E:0.106399 |  but just can't let your concentration and your discipline waver.
[4499.00 - 4502.00] P:2211.08 E:0.113671 |  On a stage like this, where Morocco are looking to get to the quarterfinals
[4502.00 - 4505.00] P:2204.80 E:0.109997 |  for the first time in their history, it's so finely poised.
[4505.00 - 4507.00] P:2205.97 E:0.104440 |  Just don't give the referee an excuse.
[4507.00 - 4510.00] P:2261.85 E:0.103796 |  Yeah, to make me know that he's actually got that in his game.
[4510.00 - 4514.00] P:2158.55 E:0.109975 |  He's given away a free kick now again, but he's got away with it.
[4514.00 - 4516.00] P:2008.32 E:0.111697 |  Avanti's played as Almo comes forward,
[4516.00 - 4518.00] P:1923.32 E:0.106838 |  cleared away by Amrabat.
[4518.00 - 4520.00] P:1833.15 E:0.099027 |  Morocco aren't happy, they want a free kick,
[4520.00 - 4523.00] P:1849.05 E:0.084969 |  they have a player down, but the ball has gone out of play,
[4523.00 - 4526.00] P:1827.29 E:0.098747 |  and now the referee is just stopping play
[4526.00 - 4532.00] P:1604.54 E:0.084797 |  to make sure that nothing on towards has happened for Kimia Walsh,
[4532.00 - 4533.00] P:1404.07 E:0.093888 |  who was colliding with Gavi.
[4533.00 - 4536.00] P:1774.42 E:0.083857 |  Yeah, he's just run into him, actually, that's quite a short one.
[4536.00 - 4539.00] P:1875.31 E:0.086551 |  They're probably making a bounce, yesh.
[4539.00 - 4541.00] P:1918.38 E:0.097242 |  You know, silly to kick the ball away.
[4541.00 - 4544.00] P:1881.76 E:0.106604 |  He's made three or four tackles already, and he's given free kicks away.
[4544.00 - 4546.00] P:1991.88 E:0.095261 |  Do you know the next one?
[4546.00 - 4548.00] P:2077.58 E:0.109407 |  The referee's thinking, I'll help you.
[4548.00 - 4549.00] P:2237.90 E:0.125669 |  Don't do it, you're absolutely right.
[4549.00 - 4552.00] P:2230.78 E:0.099563 |  It's silly to do that with so much riding on it.
[4552.00 - 4554.00] P:2178.20 E:0.117757 |  Spain in possession, forward by Busquets,
[4554.00 - 4557.00] P:2276.66 E:0.098987 |  well, blocked away for Morocco,
[4557.00 - 4559.00] P:2368.88 E:0.111850 |  and will come right back to Spain,
[4559.00 - 4562.00] P:2165.78 E:0.085215 |  and the red shirts of Morocco would just drop
[4562.00 - 4568.00] P:2289.50 E:0.105299 |  and be jumping ever deeper with the light blue shirts of Spain creep forward.
[4568.00 - 4571.00] P:2222.78 E:0.110060 |  Jordi Albin out, turns into central position,
[4571.00 - 4574.00] P:1985.49 E:0.108198 |  plays the ball into the area, headed away by Roman Saiz,
[4574.00 - 4577.00] P:1915.14 E:0.095512 |  forward again by Busquets, but no danger there,
[4577.00 - 4579.00] P:1875.83 E:0.087055 |  no light blue shirts in the box,
[4579.00 - 4582.00] P:1780.72 E:0.096979 |  and it's all the way through with Bono, nil, nil.
[4582.00 - 4584.00] P:1861.24 E:0.066719 |  It's amazing how often when something happens,
[4584.00 - 4587.00] P:1918.48 E:0.096071 |  you immediately look down towards the bench and think,
[4587.00 - 4589.00] P:1900.47 E:0.076956 |  yeah, surely now, surely now.
[4589.00 - 4591.00] P:1987.26 E:0.102070 |  It's a good-out feeling about the Spanish.
[4591.00 - 4595.00] P:1900.40 E:0.092549 |  Surely now, you've got to consider what else you can do.
[4595.00 - 4598.00] P:1822.29 E:0.089209 |  Yep, it is 60 minutes now that another has gone.
[4598.00 - 4603.00] P:1923.62 E:0.081129 |  They've created minimal chances, very, very few chances,
[4603.00 - 4605.00] P:1843.76 E:0.105679 |  and they know they're actually in a lot of bad danger
[4605.00 - 4607.00] P:1713.36 E:0.096429 |  with the speed that the Moroccans are breaking at.
[4607.00 - 4610.00] P:1945.34 E:0.088891 |  This game is extraordinarily finely poised,
[4610.00 - 4612.00] P:1856.78 E:0.095169 |  and you should be controlling it if you're Spain,
[4612.00 - 4614.00] P:1896.22 E:0.086832 |  and I'm not sure they are.
[4614.00 - 4617.00] P:1762.92 E:0.108668 |  They're in possession just inside their own half.
[4617.00 - 4619.00] P:1732.88 E:0.104871 |  Moroccan friend in the green trousers
[4619.00 - 4621.00] P:1877.01 E:0.100885 |  takes a look over his left shoulder once more
[4621.00 - 4625.00] P:1810.96 E:0.105101 |  as he leads the Moroccan fans behind that goal away to our right.
[4625.00 - 4628.00] P:1886.40 E:0.098796 |  You have to say as well, he's bouncing up and down now.
[4628.00 - 4630.00] P:2036.52 E:0.108769 |  You're right, Paine.
[4630.00 - 4632.00] P:1815.91 E:0.112658 |  He just needs to be a little bit careful there on that wall, doesn't he?
[4632.00 - 4634.00] P:1923.32 E:0.105554 |  He's having a great time.
[4634.00 - 4636.00] P:1735.96 E:0.111775 |  Morocco have had a great time at this World Cup.
[4636.00 - 4640.00] P:1820.85 E:0.095875 |  It's nil nil with Spain very much in this armoroco,
[4640.00 - 4643.00] P:1810.72 E:0.102609 |  as the free kick is given to Spain,
[4643.00 - 4645.00] P:1875.59 E:0.099727 |  and the referee comes over very quickly.
[4645.00 - 4647.00] P:1888.77 E:0.106643 |  Really, the Moroccan substitutes and the manager,
[4647.00 - 4649.00] P:1923.46 E:0.099366 |  Walid Regragi, who were furious there,
[4649.00 - 4651.00] P:1907.87 E:0.107041 |  they've not quite come on the pitch,
[4651.00 - 4653.00] P:1922.05 E:0.091838 |  but half the subs jumped off the bench,
[4653.00 - 4656.00] P:1899.45 E:0.104198 |  and the referees come over to calm them down as much as anything else.
[4656.00 - 4658.00] P:2055.24 E:0.091180 |  Yeah, we didn't see them changing.
[4658.00 - 4660.00] P:2023.28 E:0.092146 |  They are changing now, Spanish.
[4660.00 - 4662.00] P:1943.31 E:0.100564 |  Slightly overdue in my mind.
[4662.00 - 4664.00] P:2049.73 E:0.095107 |  It's taken a wee while for them to do it.
[4664.00 - 4666.00] P:2039.24 E:0.099107 |  They need to add something else going forward.
[4666.00 - 4668.00] P:2214.98 E:0.105797 |  You can't be getting out of the World Cup here.
[4668.00 - 4671.00] P:2146.56 E:0.102182 |  You're just almost sleepwalking towards going out,
[4671.00 - 4673.00] P:2104.09 E:0.109890 |  so he's going to make a couple of changes in a minute.
[4673.00 - 4674.00] P:2155.04 E:0.102692 |  Thank you.
[4674.00 - 4676.00] P:2237.30 E:0.103190 |  They're waiting till this three kicks
[4676.00 - 4679.00] P:2240.45 E:0.106020 |  have been taken, the last chance for one or two players.
[4679.00 - 4684.00] P:2193.15 E:0.110388 |  And no surprise, Alvaro Morata is one of those changes coming on.
[4684.00 - 4686.00] P:2154.91 E:0.105452 |  Carlos Soler is the other, but Morata
[4686.00 - 4688.00] P:2172.07 E:0.101368 |  has only started one match at this World Cup,
[4688.00 - 4693.00] P:2204.49 E:0.093623 |  but has scored in every single World Cup match here.
[4693.00 - 4696.00] P:2200.49 E:0.109148 |  The only player to net four in a row for Spain at a World Cup,
[4696.00 - 4699.00] P:2257.54 E:0.091547 |  or across a World Cup is David Villar.
[4699.00 - 4701.00] P:2140.85 E:0.100333 |  Spain needs something.
[4701.00 - 4702.00] P:2087.12 E:0.097259 |  It's nil nil.
[4702.00 - 4705.00] P:2123.80 E:0.104424 |  They've taken the free kick short, knocked it around between them.
[4705.00 - 4707.00] P:1805.11 E:0.105307 |  Jordi Alvaro's ball into the area.
[4707.00 - 4709.00] P:1751.41 E:0.106065 |  A bit of a swing and a misclearance by Roman Saiz.
[4709.00 - 4711.00] P:1850.29 E:0.089489 |  Bono under pressure punches.
[4711.00 - 4714.00] P:1694.32 E:0.107187 |  Not a great one, but does squeeze its way out of the penalty area
[4714.00 - 4717.00] P:1773.23 E:0.102266 |  and might turn into a great break for Morocco.
[4717.00 - 4719.00] P:1859.10 E:0.099386 |  Perhaps a bit of fortune.
[4719.00 - 4722.00] P:1770.46 E:0.104695 |  Ziesh, play continues as Ziesh was caught there.
[4722.00 - 4724.00] P:1820.44 E:0.103153 |  Referee was happy to play the advantage
[4724.00 - 4726.00] P:1747.84 E:0.097969 |  and good decision in the end.
[4726.00 - 4729.00] P:1761.21 E:0.097075 |  And Nahi can't keep going down that right-hand side
[4729.00 - 4732.00] P:1854.90 E:0.082561 |  without a play from a Morocco throw.
[4732.00 - 4734.00] P:1801.36 E:0.105774 |  They're just about to make a change here,
[4734.00 - 4736.00] P:1896.01 E:0.080437 |  but they bear the careful.
[4736.00 - 4738.00] P:1817.60 E:0.091168 |  I'm trying to see who that is down there.
[4738.00 - 4741.00] P:1809.78 E:0.089290 |  There's an injury to one of the Spanish players.
[4741.00 - 4743.00] P:1706.09 E:0.105393 |  And if you're going to make two changes,
[4743.00 - 4746.00] P:1731.11 E:0.095597 |  then one of your players is going to come down with what may well be
[4746.00 - 4747.00] P:1757.87 E:0.059794 |  a hamstring injury.
[4747.00 - 4749.00] P:1779.06 E:0.086043 |  We shall see.
[4749.00 - 4751.00] P:1723.64 E:0.105530 |  Well, they have made the first change.
[4751.00 - 4754.00] P:1471.66 E:0.104504 |  Ascensios number is up, so he's coming off.
[4754.00 - 4757.00] P:1604.62 E:0.102175 |  And Gavi is being replaced by Carlos Soler.
[4757.00 - 4759.00] P:1524.09 E:0.106866 |  So, Morato on for a centre.
[4759.00 - 4761.00] P:1611.00 E:0.093628 |  They're not waiting, are they, Spain?
[4761.00 - 4763.00] P:1652.12 E:0.108329 |  I guess if he wants to make this tactical change anyway,
[4763.00 - 4765.00] P:1595.13 E:0.099222 |  Luis Enriquez, he's got three more substitutes
[4765.00 - 4767.00] P:1733.90 E:0.083207 |  that he can make.
[4767.00 - 4769.00] P:1687.93 E:0.094085 |  Remember your extra time,
[4769.00 - 4771.00] P:1688.23 E:0.081516 |  but yeah, there's a lot of substitution you make.
[4771.00 - 4773.00] P:1796.15 E:0.084435 |  That's absolutely fine.
[4773.00 - 4775.00] P:1841.94 E:0.088561 |  He certainly moved on a little bit.
[4775.00 - 4777.00] P:1819.78 E:0.088262 |  Ascensio was stunningly quiet tonight, wasn't he?
[4777.00 - 4779.00] P:1727.06 E:0.104650 |  Staggeringly quiet.
[4779.00 - 4781.00] P:1705.05 E:0.093201 |  Very, very little input into the game today.
[4781.00 - 4783.00] P:1628.28 E:0.095189 |  So, I don't think he could complain.
[4783.00 - 4785.00] P:1745.04 E:0.092417 |  And Moratas, come on.
[4785.00 - 4788.00] P:1882.57 E:0.092373 |  He's got a good focal point now that they can get the ball up to.
[4788.00 - 4791.00] P:1862.38 E:0.103649 |  But that little break there, just before the substitutions were made,
[4791.00 - 4793.00] P:1750.74 E:0.098568 |  that was another warning sign, wasn't it?
[4793.00 - 4796.00] P:1777.30 E:0.094726 |  And it has to be said, Luis Enriquez, Gavintu,
[4796.00 - 4798.00] P:1792.22 E:0.094268 |  he spotted the warning signs.
[4798.00 - 4800.00] P:1756.01 E:0.077004 |  He had to change.
[4803.00 - 4805.00] P:1771.16 E:0.113635 |  Well, Hakimi is getting a pat on the back of the head.
[4805.00 - 4808.00] P:1604.68 E:0.103066 |  It was Jordi Alba, who was down receiving treatment,
[4808.00 - 4810.00] P:1674.32 E:0.089064 |  but he's back up to his feet.
[4810.00 - 4813.00] P:1350.70 E:0.100845 |  He looks as though he will be able to continue.
[4813.00 - 4816.00] P:1423.09 E:0.108170 |  Luis Enriquez clutching a water bottle in his left hand.
[4816.00 - 4818.00] P:1692.11 E:0.097122 |  He's waving his right hand.
[4818.00 - 4820.00] P:1661.43 E:0.106663 |  Saying, come up, push up.
[4820.00 - 4823.00] P:1544.32 E:0.101052 |  Because Morocco are in possession, just outside their own penalty area,
[4823.00 - 4825.00] P:1481.14 E:0.099378 |  all the way back to Bronnow now,
[4825.00 - 4828.00] P:1576.14 E:0.093805 |  who clears left footed out to the left-hand side.
[4828.00 - 4830.00] P:1572.26 E:0.103762 |  And Sofian Boufal, the former Southampton man.
[4830.00 - 4832.00] P:1742.35 E:0.097677 |  Crossfield pass, down the right.
[4832.00 - 4834.00] P:1838.99 E:0.087446 |  He was looking for that run of Zesh.
[4834.00 - 4836.00] P:1679.95 E:0.100307 |  It's all the way through the United Seamond.
[4836.00 - 4840.00] P:1866.30 E:0.099760 |  For all, Boufal has done well in many areas, Pat.
[4840.00 - 4842.00] P:1879.52 E:0.100119 |  His distribution, those Crossfield passes, the vision's great.
[4842.00 - 4844.00] P:2039.62 E:0.098583 |  The execution hasn't quite been there.
[4844.00 - 4846.00] P:2038.04 E:0.111502 |  I don't know, there's big weaknesses in the game.
[4846.00 - 4848.00] P:2044.37 E:0.106456 |  I think his decision-making's been poor.
[4848.00 - 4850.00] P:2173.99 E:0.106817 |  Quite a few attains, but he will do something
[4850.00 - 4852.00] P:2276.14 E:0.111708 |  very, very skillful every now and again.
[4852.00 - 4854.00] P:2207.35 E:0.107865 |  To be honest, I don't think he's going to last much longer.
[4854.00 - 4857.00] P:2275.91 E:0.101999 |  I'm having a look up there, and he seems to be struggling a wee bit.
[4857.00 - 4859.00] P:2263.52 E:0.118809 |  Maybe a calf problem.
[4860.00 - 4864.00] P:2222.34 E:0.104758 |  So ball out to the left-hand side, where Dani Olmo picks it up for Spain.
[4864.00 - 4867.00] P:2316.51 E:0.110563 |  Nil-nil here on five-live BBC Sounds,
[4867.00 - 4870.00] P:2294.29 E:0.098256 |  and a cross-Africa on the BBC World Service.
[4870.00 - 4876.00] P:2051.65 E:0.104286 |  Ball out to the right-hand side, and Ferran Torres cleared away well at the back by Masrawi,
[4876.00 - 4880.00] P:2122.65 E:0.090475 |  and will be picked up by Spain on the half-way line.
[4880.00 - 4886.00] P:2161.71 E:0.096411 |  In field now to La Porte, who will square it to Pedri, Spain.
[4886.00 - 4889.00] P:2092.30 E:0.113405 |  Pick and choose where they want to send the passes.
[4889.00 - 4892.00] P:2222.11 E:0.105527 |  So comfortable, as we know in possession.
[4892.00 - 4894.00] P:2218.09 E:0.094291 |  They send it out to the right-hand side,
[4894.00 - 4896.00] P:2142.07 E:0.105849 |  Soler the substitute will find Ferran Torres,
[4896.00 - 4900.00] P:2131.65 E:0.109048 |  who picks the ball into the area, cleared away by Roman Saiz,
[4900.00 - 4903.00] P:2115.54 E:0.093197 |  and will come back out to Spain once more.
[4903.00 - 4906.00] P:2285.47 E:0.107675 |  Midway through the Morocco half, here is Emeric La Porte.
[4906.00 - 4910.00] P:2172.56 E:0.111504 |  All the red Morocco shirts back inside their own half as the ball into the area
[4910.00 - 4914.00] P:1871.53 E:0.098043 |  just had too much on it, and Masrawi can watch it behind.
[4914.00 - 4919.00] P:1745.57 E:0.087578 |  Decent run by Ferran Torres, but to no avail.
[4919.00 - 4922.00] P:1618.39 E:0.097726 |  Well, the least of it's something for now when they hit it into the box.
[4922.00 - 4926.00] P:1754.15 E:0.090042 |  I suspect the amount of games that these teams have had so close together,
[4926.00 - 4930.00] P:1759.63 E:0.109410 |  the tension involved, we will see a lot of substitutions now.
[4930.00 - 4935.00] P:1758.16 E:0.108988 |  And it's the first chance that Morocco has had to do that, not going to do that.
[4935.00 - 4938.00] P:1760.32 E:0.105919 |  And you are absolutely right about Sophie and Bufal.
[4938.00 - 4945.00] P:1757.03 E:0.100877 |  His game is done, and coming on is 20-year-old Abdei Ezzazouli.
[4945.00 - 4950.00] P:1854.18 E:0.104072 |  He's been in and out of the side for Osasuna this season, he's on loan from Barcelona.
[4950.00 - 4955.00] P:1769.21 E:0.099605 |  20 years old, he's made a handful of appearances for Barcelona.
[4955.00 - 4962.00] P:1809.09 E:0.089414 |  And again, it's one that struggled with injury in the build-up to the World Cup.
[4962.00 - 4966.00] P:1818.50 E:0.101342 |  Born in Morocco, moved to Spain as a seven-year-old.
[4966.00 - 4973.00] P:1851.30 E:0.094333 |  So playing his club football against the Saiz that he's hoping to knock out.
[4973.00 - 4979.00] P:1666.91 E:0.097415 |  The side he's called home, or the country he's called home from when he was a young boy.
[4979.00 - 4982.00] P:1876.43 E:0.073403 |  But now on for Morocco.
[4982.00 - 4989.00] P:1897.19 E:0.073338 |  Morocco, who are still 0-0 with Spain as Hakimi loses out to Marasa.
[4989.00 - 4993.00] P:1907.86 E:0.091277 |  Ball forward from Olmó, who is poor, Saiz is underneath it once again,
[4993.00 - 4997.00] P:1899.68 E:0.099789 |  so dominant in the air, he's enjoying another good match.
[4997.00 - 5004.00] P:2209.76 E:0.096355 |  The Morocco captain, the former Walseran, for Spain pick it up just inside the Morocco half.
[5004.00 - 5011.00] P:2335.66 E:0.105344 |  Mid-weight through the second half, 0-0, and you wonder the longer this ticks on,
[5011.00 - 5018.00] P:2326.37 E:0.111067 |  whether Morocco will start to feel, is this Belgium all over again, two late goals, they want 2-0.
[5018.00 - 5020.00] P:2304.99 E:0.103127 |  And they do the same to Spain.
[5020.00 - 5023.00] P:2336.75 E:0.100517 |  They've also did the same tactical change as well.
[5023.00 - 5028.00] P:2290.53 E:0.105766 |  And they've got to see extra going play now through the middle a little bit more.
[5028.00 - 5033.00] P:2248.29 E:0.107889 |  So we shall see if he has the effect that he's had in previous games now, it's central.
[5033.00 - 5037.00] P:2144.02 E:0.108391 |  Here comes Spain with Rodri, out to the right-hand side, and Llorente,
[5037.00 - 5040.00] P:2215.22 E:0.097726 |  he's got both palms outstretched, so he'll give you an option.
[5040.00 - 5045.00] P:2073.83 E:0.099642 |  He doesn't have too many, so he goes to the right-hand side, and Ferran Torres, he does well.
[5045.00 - 5049.00] P:1783.21 E:0.100250 |  Masró, he does better than Morocco. Let's back gets a put in Spain throw, 0-0.
[5049.00 - 5054.00] P:1959.04 E:0.092432 |  Had a good game both of them, Hakimi and Masró, very very seldom have they been beaten
[5054.00 - 5058.00] P:2178.40 E:0.103657 |  by any of the players they've come up against, and that's when the real strong points
[5058.00 - 5062.00] P:2218.31 E:0.098577 |  come up, you can say the defence, but those two feel bad.
[5062.00 - 5068.00] P:2055.95 E:0.103782 |  Here comes Spain down the left-hand side, Jordi Alba plays it off Hakimi for the corner.
[5068.00 - 5073.00] P:1852.05 E:0.089396 |  I suppose this is when you're happy, if you've got Maratán, he's very very good in the up,
[5073.00 - 5078.00] P:2058.23 E:0.101064 |  certainly attacking balls, and this is maybe one area where Spain finally
[5078.00 - 5080.00] P:2208.57 E:0.110234 |  may actually play a ball into the middle.
[5080.00 - 5085.00] P:2198.43 E:0.111512 |  They'll clear the corner's shot, and Maratán will be thinking, please give me a chance.
[5085.00 - 5088.00] P:2175.77 E:0.107630 |  They've played it short, will they eventually get it in?
[5088.00 - 5095.00] P:2208.84 E:0.103740 |  Maratán is still in there on the move as Pedri pulls it back to Jordi Alba,
[5095.00 - 5099.00] P:2279.63 E:0.106850 |  and now Pedri wants more, and it's all very intricate once again from Spain,
[5099.00 - 5103.00] P:2282.14 E:0.112880 |  as Soler has it on the left-hand side, and now Pedri wants more.
[5103.00 - 5107.00] P:2116.98 E:0.103556 |  Jordi Alba will swing it in left-footed, poor delivery from the Barcelona man,
[5107.00 - 5112.00] P:2228.76 E:0.097467 |  he's picked up the clearance though, and Llorente will have it over on the right-hand side.
[5112.00 - 5117.00] P:2225.33 E:0.102607 |  He plays it forward as Spain work it all the way back to the halfway line.
[5117.00 - 5121.00] P:2122.16 E:0.101803 |  That ball did not go into the box at all from that corner, and they're in the centre-circle.
[5121.00 - 5124.00] P:2231.79 E:0.108301 |  Honestly, it's really disappointing if you're at Maratán.
[5124.00 - 5129.00] P:1936.57 E:0.107431 |  It might do now, Maratán into the penalty area, very good sliding challenge
[5129.00 - 5134.00] P:1861.43 E:0.094813 |  to just ease him out of the box, that was great defending by Ashraf Hakimi,
[5134.00 - 5141.00] P:1796.48 E:0.090342 |  and the ball is cleared away by Morocco, and they'll bring it forwards once more.
[5141.00 - 5145.00] P:2025.09 E:0.081227 |  And the ball goes out of play.
[5145.00 - 5151.00] P:1831.28 E:0.101546 |  It was a great tackle, Vicky, but it goes with his left foot,
[5151.00 - 5155.00] P:1839.04 E:0.101951 |  and it's one of those ones where really that's a right foot to tackle,
[5155.00 - 5159.00] P:1844.86 E:0.105087 |  and if you get that wrong it looks clumsy, so yeah, it turned it perfectly,
[5159.00 - 5162.00] P:1968.44 E:0.082271 |  yeah, it was a great tackle, but yes, he took a chance.
[5162.00 - 5166.00] P:2091.52 E:0.106101 |  He should give the praise to Aged, it was he who stood in the West Ham man,
[5166.00 - 5170.00] P:1954.72 E:0.100121 |  it just limped away from it as well, so we will keep an eye on that,
[5170.00 - 5175.00] P:1810.62 E:0.092991 |  moving incredibly freely at the moment as the ball is back with Bono up to the halfway line.
[5175.00 - 5179.00] P:1800.83 E:0.097144 |  24 minutes gone in this second half, this round of 16 tie,
[5179.00 - 5185.00] P:2010.66 E:0.089112 |  and we are still to find the breakthrough against Morocco and Spain.
[5185.00 - 5189.00] P:2026.80 E:0.097924 |  Rodri in possession on the halfway line, squares it to his Manchester City teammate,
[5189.00 - 5194.00] P:2038.13 E:0.098453 |  Emirate Le Porte, and now Jordi Alba, out to the left-hand side,
[5194.00 - 5198.00] P:2035.14 E:0.093437 |  and Pedri now will pick it up, and Rodri,
[5198.00 - 5201.00] P:2005.90 E:0.103607 |  and this is where Spain can start to mesmerise you,
[5201.00 - 5207.00] P:2053.69 E:0.091671 |  but what will Luis Enrique be thinking down there as he, well, we can tell,
[5207.00 - 5210.00] P:2008.98 E:0.103540 |  he's pointing, he's saying get it over to the right-hand side,
[5210.00 - 5214.00] P:2146.92 E:0.096849 |  as he waves his right forefinger over to that right-hand side,
[5214.00 - 5218.00] P:2274.89 E:0.104961 |  where Ferran Torres has been whizzing up and down the wing,
[5218.00 - 5222.00] P:2308.54 E:0.096740 |  but it's central with Rodri, he plays it out,
[5222.00 - 5225.00] P:2203.96 E:0.103999 |  they're getting over to the right-hand side, now they are out there,
[5225.00 - 5230.00] P:2220.94 E:0.098588 |  Soler to that right-hand position of Llorente,
[5230.00 - 5235.00] P:2335.15 E:0.097954 |  but they've worked it back again, and Morocco continue to drop deep,
[5235.00 - 5240.00] P:2290.36 E:0.100323 |  it's 0-0 on five-life BBC sounds, and a cross-Africa on the World Service,
[5240.00 - 5244.00] P:2292.82 E:0.103550 |  here is Pedri, back to Le Porte once more.
[5244.00 - 5247.00] P:2229.17 E:0.096340 |  It's metronomic, isn't it? It's just metronomic.
[5247.00 - 5251.00] P:2253.23 E:0.100631 |  And sometimes that's impressive, as long as it's got an end product,
[5251.00 - 5254.00] P:2256.04 E:0.105197 |  and there's a zip passing, and a Speedy pass at the end,
[5254.00 - 5258.00] P:2330.35 E:0.103568 |  there just hasn't been enough of that so far from Spain.
[5258.00 - 5261.00] P:2317.08 E:0.109061 |  Soler will head off to the right-hand side once again,
[5261.00 - 5265.00] P:2262.67 E:0.111149 |  and now all the way back to Rodri, and the series got bored,
[5265.00 - 5270.00] P:2223.30 E:0.097722 |  and has come to close Rodri down, and now he drops back into that defensive line
[5270.00 - 5274.00] P:2318.36 E:0.098243 |  for Morocco, and Rodri has it once again.
[5274.00 - 5278.00] P:2203.90 E:0.106738 |  The G is, we presume from the Morocco fans, but occasionally,
[5278.00 - 5281.00] P:2168.72 E:0.100494 |  the Spain fans get frustrated with this sort of passing as well.
[5281.00 - 5283.00] P:2202.39 E:0.105553 |  It's impossible to tell inside the stadium,
[5283.00 - 5285.00] P:2274.68 E:0.104166 |  Morocco have been during Spain when they've been in possession,
[5285.00 - 5288.00] P:2317.54 E:0.100425 |  but depending on the thoughts of the Spain fans watching on as well,
[5288.00 - 5291.00] P:2089.03 E:0.106335 |  because they're not at the moment getting near the penalty area,
[5291.00 - 5293.00] P:1793.68 E:0.112559 |  we know that that's how they like to build up,
[5293.00 - 5296.00] P:1910.16 E:0.096444 |  and if they can find the final ball and get a goal, well, all good,
[5296.00 - 5299.00] P:1862.59 E:0.100973 |  but they've lost possession, Zeehash has played it back in,
[5299.00 - 5301.00] P:1844.37 E:0.095839 |  and Sais goes over the top,
[5301.00 - 5304.00] P:1748.23 E:0.099991 |  and he's defending here to do for Llorente.
[5304.00 - 5306.00] P:1856.39 E:0.091620 |  I've been waiting for this.
[5306.00 - 5309.00] P:1884.13 E:0.091664 |  The youngsters come on there, see who plays against the field back.
[5309.00 - 5311.00] P:1874.35 E:0.097715 |  Give them the ball, give them a chance.
[5311.00 - 5313.00] P:2012.21 E:0.105523 |  He's playing against Llorente, he's not comfortable.
[5313.00 - 5316.00] P:2118.34 E:0.115858 |  But here comes Spain, and now suddenly it opens up a little bit,
[5316.00 - 5320.00] P:1973.24 E:0.101734 |  as Morocco lose possession, excellent sliding challenge.
[5320.00 - 5323.00] P:1659.69 E:0.107349 |  Wins the ball back from Morocco outside their own penalty area,
[5323.00 - 5325.00] P:1719.45 E:0.100844 |  and the ball is over the top,
[5325.00 - 5328.00] P:1753.21 E:0.092914 |  Jordi Alba will win the header, but only into space,
[5328.00 - 5330.00] P:1761.26 E:0.112646 |  and will be picked up by Zeehash, midway through the Spain half.
[5330.00 - 5334.00] P:1811.84 E:0.106910 |  Plays it forward, Zeehash, it just ran past Amalah,
[5334.00 - 5336.00] P:1730.10 E:0.093234 |  and will be picked up by Llorente.
[5336.00 - 5339.00] P:1795.41 E:0.093981 |  Amalah looking a little bit tired out there now,
[5339.00 - 5342.00] P:1975.36 E:0.095567 |  but in a good position, but now has to get back into fend.
[5342.00 - 5345.00] P:1949.87 E:0.098956 |  They've worked so hard, these Moroccan players.
[5345.00 - 5347.00] P:2047.99 E:0.101827 |  Defensively, their discipline's been excellent.
[5347.00 - 5350.00] P:1987.00 E:0.096076 |  We thought it would be, they've only conceded once.
[5350.00 - 5353.00] P:1959.26 E:0.102908 |  Still so far at this World Cup, that was against Canada.
[5353.00 - 5358.00] P:2161.15 E:0.086153 |  But now, as we approach the final 18 minutes,
[5358.00 - 5361.00] P:2070.86 E:0.101499 |  is where that concentration needs to be maintained,
[5361.00 - 5363.00] P:2013.77 E:0.102829 |  and Spain haven't kept their concentration there.
[5363.00 - 5367.00] P:1887.17 E:0.099407 |  Daniil Mo offside, Morocco free-keep midway through their own half.
[5367.00 - 5368.00] P:1518.54 E:0.108187 |  0-0.
[5368.00 - 5372.00] P:1650.43 E:0.085828 |  I think you may have touched on the most important point of the game there.
[5372.00 - 5374.00] P:1820.35 E:0.096237 |  The Moroccans have chased quite a lot.
[5374.00 - 5376.00] P:1922.96 E:0.097010 |  I mean, they've tried to keep their energy,
[5376.00 - 5378.00] P:1875.50 E:0.089241 |  they get back in the line,
[5378.00 - 5380.00] P:1701.58 E:0.103613 |  allowed Spain to have the ball in front of them,
[5380.00 - 5383.00] P:1726.16 E:0.095379 |  but it's much, much harder when you haven't got the ball,
[5383.00 - 5386.00] P:1819.76 E:0.104158 |  and you've played all these games, and again, you said right at the start,
[5386.00 - 5390.00] P:1866.20 E:0.094810 |  they've not made many changes, so you get to feeling them in Morocco,
[5390.00 - 5394.00] P:1909.02 E:0.086614 |  you would expect them to be more likely to win this game
[5394.00 - 5398.00] P:1860.11 E:0.094376 |  if they could win it in 90, more than 120, because they may get tired.
[5398.00 - 5401.00] P:1994.81 E:0.106463 |  Crossfield pass from Zeeh, after a lovely bit of skill,
[5401.00 - 5403.00] P:2094.00 E:0.108546 |  is intercepted by Llorente.
[5403.00 - 5406.00] P:2270.59 E:0.100214 |  That hasn't worked that often, the Crossfield ball from Morocco.
[5406.00 - 5409.00] P:2291.49 E:0.106150 |  I just wonder whether Zeeh could have just kept going down that right-hand side.
[5409.00 - 5411.00] P:2263.15 E:0.113907 |  He really looked like he was finished right there,
[5411.00 - 5413.00] P:2220.38 E:0.099455 |  but Spain have it over on the left now.
[5413.00 - 5417.00] P:2321.75 E:0.103534 |  Here is Dani Olmo, plays it in field to Pedri, close down by Amrabat,
[5417.00 - 5419.00] P:2120.77 E:0.098865 |  meant for the return ball to Olmo.
[5419.00 - 5422.00] P:1826.68 E:0.091969 |  That's quite fiercely backed by Hakimi Tabano.
[5422.00 - 5425.00] P:1871.38 E:0.090557 |  Zeeh tries to control, does get enough on it to send it to Amrabat,
[5425.00 - 5429.00] P:1990.42 E:0.101577 |  but that's poor from Amrabat, and it's just shouting at Zeeh there.
[5429.00 - 5431.00] P:2019.39 E:0.085213 |  Frustration perhaps from playing the pass,
[5431.00 - 5434.00] P:1986.37 E:0.102270 |  but also just wants Morocco to push up a little bit more,
[5434.00 - 5438.00] P:2189.60 E:0.099386 |  and Morocco, all of a sudden, I mean, Spain have slowed it to walking pace,
[5438.00 - 5441.00] P:2200.38 E:0.100684 |  but Morocco responding in kind, getting back into shape.
[5441.00 - 5447.00] P:2180.46 E:0.099869 |  And this is where tired legs, tired minds could come into the equation here.
[5447.00 - 5450.00] P:2125.04 E:0.107873 |  We're into the final 16 minutes plus at a time.
[5450.00 - 5456.00] P:2137.32 E:0.096161 |  It's still goal-less here on 5 Live BBC Sounds and across Africa on the World Service.
[5456.00 - 5459.00] P:2214.06 E:0.101030 |  Nico Williams is preparing to come on for Spain,
[5459.00 - 5462.00] P:2219.27 E:0.106888 |  who have it midway through the Morocco half-central position.
[5462.00 - 5466.00] P:2274.94 E:0.102141 |  Out to the left now it goes, and Pedri, Jordi Elba plays it in field to Olmo.
[5466.00 - 5468.00] P:1909.26 E:0.112187 |  All lovely term as he caught there by Amrabat,
[5468.00 - 5471.00] P:1865.29 E:0.104696 |  but he stayed down Olmo, referee says no.
[5471.00 - 5473.00] P:1952.43 E:0.109138 |  Amrabat then runs into the referee, accidentally.
[5473.00 - 5475.00] P:2111.20 E:0.106021 |  Spain have worked it out to the right-hand side,
[5475.00 - 5478.00] P:1882.58 E:0.103279 |  excellent defending by Masrao, he just stuck out a boot,
[5478.00 - 5481.00] P:1821.82 E:0.095499 |  dispossessed Ferran Torres, and clears it forward,
[5481.00 - 5484.00] P:1933.98 E:0.095952 |  but it's given away by the substitute as Azuli,
[5484.00 - 5488.00] P:2032.62 E:0.094615 |  and Spain pick it up once more midway through the Morocco half.
[5488.00 - 5490.00] P:2166.00 E:0.101212 |  It's got to take Nico Williams about 10 minutes to get on, isn't it?
[5490.00 - 5495.00] P:2050.28 E:0.095957 |  As the ball is out to the right-hand side again, Masrao is there,
[5495.00 - 5498.00] P:1840.44 E:0.095802 |  makes the interception, ball goes out of play for Spain,
[5498.00 - 5500.00] P:1731.44 E:0.102344 |  and now the change will be made,
[5500.00 - 5503.00] P:1772.97 E:0.083674 |  and it's Ferran Torres' number that's coming up,
[5503.00 - 5505.00] P:1787.44 E:0.092847 |  and Nico Williams will replace it.
[5505.00 - 5509.00] P:1874.68 E:0.098220 |  I suppose that's something on the feather in the cap of those full-backs.
[5509.00 - 5512.00] P:1941.31 E:0.096116 |  Players are playing against, keep on getting taken off,
[5512.00 - 5514.00] P:1814.04 E:0.111022 |  so they've done really, really well.
[5514.00 - 5517.00] P:1852.80 E:0.097805 |  So Nico Williams, maybe a little bit more direct,
[5517.00 - 5519.00] P:1852.98 E:0.098890 |  a bit more power about him as well,
[5519.00 - 5521.00] P:1944.43 E:0.084450 |  so the Spanish are trying things now.
[5521.00 - 5524.00] P:2018.41 E:0.086305 |  They know that Plane certainly didn't work,
[5524.00 - 5526.00] P:2095.96 E:0.092724 |  and I just wonder if there is a Plane being...
[5526.00 - 5529.00] P:1999.78 E:0.103836 |  Yeah, four goals for Athletic Bilbao this season,
[5529.00 - 5533.00] P:1942.79 E:0.105186 |  for Nico Williams, has featured in every match so far at this World Cup.
[5533.00 - 5539.00] P:2072.54 E:0.099232 |  Spain in position, 0-0 into the final, 14.5 minutes.
[5539.00 - 5542.00] P:1971.39 E:0.098439 |  Good skill by Busquets, very good skill,
[5542.00 - 5544.00] P:1801.12 E:0.102085 |  so went it back by Morocco.
[5544.00 - 5546.00] P:1931.04 E:0.087376 |  A little casual on the edge of their own penalty area,
[5546.00 - 5548.00] P:1655.59 E:0.112486 |  but they do get away with it.
[5548.00 - 5551.00] P:1811.48 E:0.099793 |  That was in the series back there, the tall, rangy centre half.
[5551.00 - 5553.00] P:1734.99 E:0.099438 |  Beautiful play on the edge of his own box.
[5553.00 - 5555.00] P:1915.05 E:0.080238 |  Calmness under pressure, a bit of skill as well,
[5555.00 - 5557.00] P:1665.27 E:0.106078 |  as CS plays it all the way back to Bono.
[5557.00 - 5560.00] P:1686.11 E:0.107381 |  Loose touch, almost charged down by Jordi Alba,
[5560.00 - 5562.00] P:1892.50 E:0.099932 |  and again, we haven't seen that for a while from Morocco,
[5562.00 - 5564.00] P:1772.21 E:0.099571 |  but they've just got to be careful there
[5564.00 - 5567.00] P:1961.11 E:0.104066 |  as the Kiwi is caught by La Porte,
[5567.00 - 5571.00] P:1988.22 E:0.107729 |  and that will be our first yellow card of the game.
[5571.00 - 5574.00] P:1921.21 E:0.118747 |  And La Porte is climbing, he never touched them.
[5574.00 - 5576.00] P:1742.36 E:0.094126 |  Now, the difficulty of this angle,
[5576.00 - 5581.00] P:1777.00 E:0.103036 |  referee is very close, tiny, tiny, tiny step,
[5581.00 - 5586.00] P:1623.16 E:0.091665 |  and the referee couldn't get to his pocket quick enough there, could he?
[5586.00 - 5588.00] P:1668.15 E:0.092107 |  He was desperate to get it out there.
[5588.00 - 5590.00] P:1848.08 E:0.093902 |  I think the referee felt that the challenge
[5590.00 - 5592.00] P:1874.42 E:0.104146 |  where he stood up was going to be made,
[5592.00 - 5594.00] P:1908.34 E:0.084050 |  but he took his feet away there.
[5594.00 - 5599.00] P:1820.63 E:0.084635 |  There was no great challenge, so I think he'll survive.
[5599.00 - 5602.00] P:1865.72 E:0.082062 |  Well, he's gone over there to have a word with the Kiwi,
[5602.00 - 5604.00] P:1869.88 E:0.104233 |  and he's been down, and whatever he said to the Kiwi
[5604.00 - 5607.00] P:1819.25 E:0.093916 |  is annoyed the Kiwi enough that he's stopped grabbing his leg,
[5607.00 - 5609.00] P:1673.47 E:0.109896 |  and he's been down, and he's been down,
[5609.00 - 5611.00] P:1533.41 E:0.097888 |  and he's been down enough that he's stopped grabbing his leg,
[5611.00 - 5615.00] P:1644.17 E:0.098199 |  and he's got up very quickly in irritation.
[5615.00 - 5618.00] P:1767.57 E:0.073229 |  It's more than how hard a toenail break can be.
[5618.00 - 5621.00] P:1679.58 E:0.088643 |  No, and that's the actual fact, but it's the tiny little felt.
[5621.00 - 5623.00] P:1880.04 E:0.087142 |  There's nothing more than that.
[5623.00 - 5625.00] P:1817.30 E:0.092743 |  The referee is getting his card out right away,
[5625.00 - 5629.00] P:1842.94 E:0.090855 |  desperate to throw it in the face of the Spaniard.
[5629.00 - 5632.00] P:1967.42 E:0.104329 |  This is really unfair. There's nothing in that, absolutely nothing.
[5632.00 - 5636.00] P:2154.69 E:0.094631 |  And there hasn't been a huge bunch of Spanish girls this game anyway.
[5636.00 - 5639.00] P:2148.71 E:0.113019 |  Spain in possession, midway through their own half, 0-0.
[5639.00 - 5641.00] P:2284.21 E:0.096673 |  13 minutes to side of time to play.
[5641.00 - 5642.00] P:2194.06 E:0.109826 |  I think you're right, Pat.
[5642.00 - 5644.00] P:2217.67 E:0.097451 |  I think he thinks that La Porte is going to catch him on the knee,
[5644.00 - 5646.00] P:2081.11 E:0.107428 |  which would be a yellow, but then he doesn't,
[5646.00 - 5648.00] P:2351.68 E:0.092849 |  and he's already given the free-kick, and says,
[5648.00 - 5651.00] P:2270.88 E:0.098504 |  well, you might as well have the yellow card into the bargain.
[5651.00 - 5653.00] P:2179.48 E:0.099439 |  So here comes Spain, down the left-hand side with Olmone.
[5653.00 - 5658.00] P:2231.92 E:0.094053 |  Plays it back to Jordi Alba, now back to Pedri,
[5658.00 - 5660.00] P:2160.70 E:0.085714 |  looking for the run through the centre,
[5660.00 - 5663.00] P:2032.73 E:0.104460 |  will Ricochet kindly, Marata plays it out to the left-hand side.
[5663.00 - 5665.00] P:1993.06 E:0.112877 |  Jordi Alba's ball in, cleared away by Marocca.
[5665.00 - 5668.00] P:1870.63 E:0.105352 |  Danny Olmone will pick it up on the edge of the box and drive,
[5668.00 - 5671.00] P:1837.74 E:0.102864 |  and it's high, and it's wild, and it's wide.
[5671.00 - 5674.00] P:1840.46 E:0.089171 |  And it's not impressive. It really isn't impressive.
[5674.00 - 5677.00] P:1918.52 E:0.087029 |  And again, goes on, came with a chant beforehand.
[5677.00 - 5680.00] P:1850.43 E:0.113329 |  We've chatted a number of people who have watched Spanish football.
[5680.00 - 5684.00] P:1949.92 E:0.106197 |  Game ball, game was very, very good on it, just saying.
[5684.00 - 5687.00] P:1944.05 E:0.106812 |  It sounds a bit yawning, you know, it sounds like they're going to get a cup of tea.
[5687.00 - 5690.00] P:1973.43 E:0.106159 |  As you know, they're doing the great thing about the Spaniards
[5690.00 - 5693.00] P:1890.94 E:0.109737 |  before the hand, 10 years going by.
[5693.00 - 5698.00] P:1952.39 E:0.092180 |  That explosion, with that piece of beautiful brilliance that you would get
[5698.00 - 5701.00] P:1820.16 E:0.090103 |  from the great players, just not seen enough of it here.
[5701.00 - 5704.00] P:1691.85 E:0.100404 |  We watched it in the first game, yeah, it was impressive there.
[5704.00 - 5707.00] P:1746.65 E:0.101255 |  Even at the start of the second game against Germany, it was impressive,
[5707.00 - 5710.00] P:1854.60 E:0.073792 |  but it has faded badly.
[5710.00 - 5713.00] P:1901.67 E:0.105179 |  Might be kept in for Morocco by Enna Ciri,
[5713.00 - 5717.00] P:2055.34 E:0.094530 |  and Spain come forward over the halfway line with Biscuits.
[5717.00 - 5720.00] P:2116.50 E:0.097929 |  The Morocco fans still banging the drum.
[5720.00 - 5723.00] P:2176.88 E:0.108198 |  Our friend in the green trousers is there still orchestrating things.
[5723.00 - 5726.00] P:2051.95 E:0.101416 |  You've seen a couple of lion outfits in the crowd as well.
[5726.00 - 5728.00] P:2205.67 E:0.095710 |  Morocco's nickname is the Atlas Lions.
[5728.00 - 5731.00] P:2162.22 E:0.099629 |  They're the last African country left in this World Cup,
[5731.00 - 5734.00] P:2155.10 E:0.087454 |  the last Arab country as well.
[5734.00 - 5738.00] P:2132.15 E:0.096531 |  They knew they'd get big support here in Qatar, and they have done.
[5738.00 - 5742.00] P:2155.08 E:0.097776 |  They've come in their numbers, and they are seeing their side holding
[5742.00 - 5747.00] P:2100.72 E:0.094196 |  the 2010 World Cup winners, Spain, in this last 16 time.
[5747.00 - 5750.00] P:1944.27 E:0.112563 |  Spain now coming down the right-hand side.
[5750.00 - 5754.00] P:1833.74 E:0.092473 |  Ball in, oh, Dani Olmo was in there, and the sliding challenge was made,
[5754.00 - 5756.00] P:1773.83 E:0.092458 |  and the ball spins away.
[5756.00 - 5760.00] P:1885.36 E:0.100357 |  Good chance there for Dani Olmo, and he's saying, well, was I caught there?
[5760.00 - 5763.00] P:1961.89 E:0.072280 |  Well, I'm going to ask a question.
[5763.00 - 5765.00] P:1851.00 E:0.091123 |  Spain allowed to do that.
[5765.00 - 5768.00] P:1888.15 E:0.081197 |  Run out of play, I'm trying to beat them.
[5768.00 - 5772.00] P:1895.72 E:0.103381 |  They so rarely do it, that it kind of jumps out at you
[5772.00 - 5774.00] P:1887.80 E:0.102130 |  when someone like Nika Worms comes on.
[5774.00 - 5777.00] P:1898.12 E:0.098106 |  He's got a big trick on him, he's just causing furl's down the lane,
[5777.00 - 5781.00] P:1901.91 E:0.100411 |  and he just is possibly the best half chance of this half for them.
[5781.00 - 5785.00] P:1898.91 E:0.094690 |  So, it's really surprising that Nika Worms hasn't been brought on.
[5785.00 - 5788.00] P:1851.93 E:0.094264 |  Just to adapt it, ask a different question.
[5790.00 - 5793.00] P:2083.95 E:0.090513 |  So, Spain in possession.
[5793.00 - 5796.00] P:2092.66 E:0.095286 |  Here is Jordi Alba, I have to say,
[5796.00 - 5799.00] P:2188.12 E:0.093416 |  that was an absolutely outstanding challenge from again.
[5799.00 - 5802.00] P:2181.98 E:0.106192 |  No way, a penalty for Spain, but they're into the penalty area.
[5802.00 - 5805.00] P:2050.55 E:0.107526 |  Once again, ball is pulled across, good charge down.
[5805.00 - 5808.00] P:1883.41 E:0.096634 |  It's the Spain corner, Morocco, we're appealing for an offside flag.
[5808.00 - 5812.00] P:1895.19 E:0.096312 |  They didn't come, they stayed switched on, they defended it just as it would be,
[5812.00 - 5816.00] P:1813.83 E:0.103278 |  but they're disappointed that the flag hasn't been raised over on the far side.
[5816.00 - 5818.00] P:2131.16 E:0.108072 |  They want to make a couple of substitutions,
[5818.00 - 5821.00] P:2147.51 E:0.108610 |  but classically, you're not going to do that, going there again,
[5821.00 - 5823.00] P:2179.20 E:0.107294 |  so they're going to let this play out.
[5823.00 - 5826.00] P:2242.94 E:0.098793 |  And they played the corner shorts,
[5826.00 - 5829.00] P:2231.59 E:0.093525 |  full back, full Spain,
[5829.00 - 5832.00] P:2182.09 E:0.107452 |  and will be squared now to Jordi Alba.
[5832.00 - 5836.00] P:2019.21 E:0.103973 |  Dinks the ball into the penalty area, cleared away by Morocco
[5836.00 - 5838.00] P:1649.82 E:0.095302 |  and helped on on the edge of the box,
[5838.00 - 5840.00] P:1816.52 E:0.096897 |  but they won't be able to fashion the counter.
[5840.00 - 5843.00] P:1882.50 E:0.086535 |  This is the problem from Morocco, they're defending so well,
[5843.00 - 5846.00] P:1990.89 E:0.101678 |  but the players are so deep that there is no outlet really,
[5846.00 - 5848.00] P:2106.51 E:0.082798 |  and it's coming straight back at them.
[5848.00 - 5851.00] P:2089.87 E:0.097548 |  However, as Pat has touched on throughout this match,
[5851.00 - 5855.00] P:2087.55 E:0.094922 |  we know, we know Spain have the quality out of nothing,
[5855.00 - 5859.00] P:2176.61 E:0.102509 |  to gear up, to go through the gears, to put together a lovely move,
[5859.00 - 5862.00] P:2169.50 E:0.093565 |  and to take the lead and to break Moroccan hearts,
[5862.00 - 5865.00] P:2204.05 E:0.100328 |  but they haven't done it enough so far.
[5865.00 - 5867.00] P:2139.26 E:0.110820 |  What can Nico Williams do here?
[5867.00 - 5869.00] P:1936.83 E:0.106960 |  Place the ball through into the area, Marata down to the bar,
[5869.00 - 5871.00] P:1814.99 E:0.102823 |  and all whips it right across the face of goal.
[5871.00 - 5874.00] P:1817.68 E:0.099813 |  The angle was disappearing all the time,
[5874.00 - 5877.00] P:1921.52 E:0.086461 |  and it's across the goal line and spins out.
[5877.00 - 5880.00] P:1608.77 E:0.111511 |  Well, if he'd scored from there, it would have been pretty remarkable.
[5880.00 - 5882.00] P:1942.33 E:0.094427 |  Could he have done anything else, Pat?
[5882.00 - 5884.00] P:1735.90 E:0.106949 |  No, I think he did, evidently.
[5884.00 - 5886.00] P:1970.02 E:0.093330 |  The movement was good.
[5886.00 - 5888.00] P:1797.32 E:0.100985 |  Once again, it's livened them up a little bit,
[5888.00 - 5890.00] P:1927.75 E:0.098414 |  since they've made that change.
[5890.00 - 5893.00] P:1943.71 E:0.095722 |  Well, the two changes, Marata, they'll make the strikers run.
[5893.00 - 5895.00] P:1906.21 E:0.101954 |  So at least there's something to aim at.
[5895.00 - 5897.00] P:1850.82 E:0.092388 |  So he makes the strikers run there, he's very, very wide,
[5897.00 - 5899.00] P:1814.53 E:0.069262 |  so it's understandable, it didn't get in.
[5899.00 - 5902.00] P:1889.01 E:0.099367 |  But again, it's Nico Williams, a little bit of pace,
[5902.00 - 5904.00] P:1931.26 E:0.095191 |  go and ask a question about the defender,
[5904.00 - 5906.00] P:1849.52 E:0.105791 |  and it's livened things up a little bit.
[5906.00 - 5908.00] P:1927.77 E:0.058852 |  Well, for Spain anyway.
[5910.00 - 5912.00] P:1909.92 E:0.109846 |  So they're making three substitutions, that's right.
[5912.00 - 5914.00] P:1585.65 E:0.084300 |  There's a little change being made.
[5914.00 - 5917.00] P:1798.54 E:0.107273 |  And it's not really a huge surprise,
[5917.00 - 5919.00] P:1708.78 E:0.084314 |  that they're going to make those sort of changes just now,
[5919.00 - 5921.00] P:1713.75 E:0.103799 |  because they are getting tired.
[5921.00 - 5924.00] P:1780.95 E:0.091561 |  There's an exhaustion almost about the team.
[5924.00 - 5927.00] P:1818.52 E:0.086615 |  And it makes good sense, they've done that.
[5930.00 - 5933.00] P:1704.46 E:0.070214 |  So the players coming on,
[5933.00 - 5935.00] P:1888.42 E:0.077812 |  Waleed Shedira,
[5935.00 - 5938.00] P:1870.23 E:0.069429 |  Abdulhamid Sabiri,
[5938.00 - 5941.00] P:1892.89 E:0.073885 |  and Yahya Atiyat-Alar,
[5941.00 - 5943.00] P:1818.77 E:0.060771 |  Fort Morocco,
[5943.00 - 5944.00] P:1897.36 E:0.085973 |  Off-Go,
[5944.00 - 5946.00] P:1939.98 E:0.066478 |  In the Serie,
[5946.00 - 5947.00] P:1838.39 E:0.085237 |  Amalaa,
[5947.00 - 5950.00] P:1878.73 E:0.083741 |  and Mazrawi, who's had a very good game.
[5950.00 - 5952.00] P:1827.75 E:0.102718 |  We are still waiting to get back underway.
[5952.00 - 5954.00] P:1797.82 E:0.094428 |  Can I say, well done getting all them there,
[5954.00 - 5956.00] P:1955.86 E:0.087829 |  because they're coming so quickly.
[5956.00 - 5958.00] P:1813.03 E:0.094557 |  And the other thing is,
[5958.00 - 5960.00] P:1906.43 E:0.098195 |  players are going off the pitch all over the place,
[5960.00 - 5962.00] P:1947.18 E:0.091285 |  sometimes as well, you know,
[5962.00 - 5964.00] P:1756.87 E:0.096134 |  so it's hard to see which ones are going off,
[5964.00 - 5965.00] P:1863.58 E:0.087114 |  and which ones are coming on.
[5965.00 - 5967.00] P:1800.33 E:0.106743 |  But they needed to make those changes, Morocco.
[5967.00 - 5969.00] P:1873.60 E:0.100702 |  You just see a lot of tiredness creeping in,
[5969.00 - 5971.00] P:1797.67 E:0.092355 |  they're not getting off the field as often as they were,
[5971.00 - 5973.00] P:1868.19 E:0.102002 |  you know, at the start of the second half.
[5973.00 - 5975.00] P:1844.23 E:0.088194 |  And also, you know,
[5975.00 - 5977.00] P:1884.66 E:0.097404 |  if you get that liveliness from Marata coming on,
[5977.00 - 5980.00] P:1716.11 E:0.090188 |  and from Nico Williams on the right wing there,
[5980.00 - 5982.00] P:1840.97 E:0.092384 |  they need a little bit more vitality.
[5982.00 - 5984.00] P:1954.64 E:0.098602 |  Now Ziesha's gone down,
[5984.00 - 5986.00] P:1778.85 E:0.091022 |  so Morocco have won a free kick.
[5986.00 - 5987.00] P:1958.07 E:0.080605 |  So Waleed Shedira,
[5987.00 - 5990.00] P:1783.99 E:0.105937 |  he's the leading scorer in the Italian second tier this season,
[5990.00 - 5993.00] P:1654.96 E:0.102270 |  nine goals in 12 games.
[5993.00 - 5995.00] P:1959.50 E:0.067458 |  So he is on.
[5995.00 - 5998.00] P:1804.23 E:0.082599 |  Yahya Atiat-Ellar played under
[5998.00 - 6001.00] P:1803.99 E:0.098069 |  Morocco's manager Waleed Ragraghi,
[6001.00 - 6003.00] P:1782.92 E:0.096901 |  as they won the African Champions League
[6003.00 - 6005.00] P:1774.24 E:0.096604 |  with Waira Dacasa Blanca.
[6005.00 - 6008.00] P:1774.13 E:0.086905 |  That was the positive domestic spell
[6008.00 - 6011.00] P:1702.11 E:0.097904 |  that earned Ragraghi the Morocco job.
[6011.00 - 6013.00] P:1723.18 E:0.082301 |  And Adha Mead Sabiri,
[6013.00 - 6015.00] P:1823.49 E:0.093358 |  well thought he had a goal at the World Cup
[6015.00 - 6017.00] P:1886.46 E:0.084197 |  with that free kick that nearly went all the way in
[6017.00 - 6019.00] P:1570.34 E:0.093099 |  against Belgium,
[6019.00 - 6021.00] P:1745.91 E:0.062959 |  but took that tiny nick off Roman Saiz
[6021.00 - 6023.00] P:1432.27 E:0.108878 |  for my Huddersfield man as well,
[6023.00 - 6025.00] P:1773.03 E:0.068926 |  a handful of appearances for them.
[6025.00 - 6027.00] P:1885.68 E:0.107985 |  And having just made the triple change,
[6027.00 - 6032.00] P:1636.59 E:0.075727 |  Morocco might have to make another one as well,
[6032.00 - 6035.00] P:1779.05 E:0.083320 |  because it's the West Ham man, Naif Aged,
[6035.00 - 6037.00] P:1698.47 E:0.111284 |  who's put in some brilliant blocks,
[6037.00 - 6040.00] P:1917.74 E:0.103899 |  but he's been struggling in the last 15 minutes,
[6040.00 - 6042.00] P:1929.89 E:0.086981 |  and he just can't continue.
[6042.00 - 6044.00] P:1837.89 E:0.108802 |  So that's another break, and he has played very well.
[6044.00 - 6046.00] P:1698.37 E:0.091226 |  I have to say he's played superbly well.
[6046.00 - 6049.00] P:1466.78 E:0.093937 |  But you can tell when a player is just desperate
[6049.00 - 6050.00] P:1545.22 E:0.117186 |  to stay on the field,
[6050.00 - 6052.00] P:1647.18 E:0.084991 |  he does end that he stays on the field,
[6052.00 - 6054.00] P:1517.38 E:0.104872 |  but he's not able to do that.
[6054.00 - 6056.00] P:1471.33 E:0.085295 |  And El Yameek's going to come on now.
[6056.00 - 6059.00] P:1578.90 E:0.093477 |  And he's going to get a few questions asked about him,
[6059.00 - 6061.00] P:1758.52 E:0.087678 |  because Minata's movement's been much better.
[6061.00 - 6063.00] P:1705.51 E:0.102434 |  Everyone's always known about Minata's movement.
[6063.00 - 6065.00] P:1686.86 E:0.080071 |  It's always been good.
[6065.00 - 6066.00] P:1690.68 E:0.097977 |  The question in the past,
[6066.00 - 6068.00] P:1782.43 E:0.090797 |  was what's your finishing like?
[6068.00 - 6069.00] P:1665.22 E:0.083624 |  Is that good enough?
[6069.00 - 6071.00] P:1736.61 E:0.095823 |  And certainly in his period of time at Chelsea,
[6071.00 - 6072.00] P:1593.44 E:0.102518 |  it wasn't brilliant,
[6072.00 - 6075.00] P:1745.45 E:0.086790 |  but it's been much better since he's been back to spin.
[6076.00 - 6077.00] P:1967.98 E:0.094142 |  So Morocco,
[6077.00 - 6080.00] P:1780.10 E:0.108792 |  swing the free kick out to the left-hand side.
[6080.00 - 6081.00] P:1894.43 E:0.074436 |  El Yameek,
[6081.00 - 6084.00] P:1699.60 E:0.088866 |  another one of those who plays his club football
[6084.00 - 6087.00] P:1623.58 E:0.091120 |  in Spain for Real Valladolid.
[6088.00 - 6092.00] P:1837.84 E:0.076569 |  Taking part at his first World Cup,
[6092.00 - 6094.00] P:1874.61 E:0.079879 |  and Armorrocco
[6094.00 - 6097.00] P:1793.32 E:0.085839 |  to reach the quarterfinals for the first time
[6097.00 - 6099.00] P:1907.64 E:0.073012 |  in their history.
[6099.00 - 6101.00] P:1848.87 E:0.098521 |  The nil-nil with Spain,
[6101.00 - 6105.00] P:1907.07 E:0.083194 |  will they get, as they did against Belgium,
[6105.00 - 6108.00] P:1844.84 E:0.091181 |  one or two late chances?
[6108.00 - 6110.00] P:1754.61 E:0.107783 |  This man might help to create them.
[6110.00 - 6112.00] P:1830.18 E:0.116383 |  But the ball is in the area,
[6112.00 - 6113.00] P:1843.61 E:0.096365 |  the header is down,
[6113.00 - 6116.00] P:1900.55 E:0.103701 |  the shot on the turn is scrambled
[6116.00 - 6118.00] P:1840.84 E:0.103821 |  towards Unai C-Mod.
[6118.00 - 6120.00] P:1878.87 E:0.106843 |  Well, almost, almost,
[6120.00 - 6123.00] P:1865.55 E:0.090196 |  for the substitute Valladolid Shedira.
[6123.00 - 6126.00] P:1751.36 E:0.095264 |  In part, they're going to get those chances.
[6126.00 - 6127.00] P:1694.40 E:0.111376 |  That is the game plan.
[6127.00 - 6129.00] P:1656.99 E:0.107662 |  We've watched it, we've watched it time and again.
[6129.00 - 6131.00] P:1783.52 E:0.100014 |  They're becoming quite infrequent,
[6131.00 - 6133.00] P:1798.92 E:0.103449 |  these little breaks now,
[6133.00 - 6135.00] P:1688.48 E:0.116841 |  but they don't have to do it quite long,
[6135.00 - 6137.00] P:1639.10 E:0.101900 |  and they zapped up the field there.
[6137.00 - 6139.00] P:1586.57 E:0.122640 |  They say, if they're just waiting for that time-lil moment,
[6139.00 - 6142.00] P:1853.69 E:0.116980 |  they'll soak up as much pressure as they possibly can.
[6142.00 - 6144.00] P:1756.89 E:0.120986 |  And they do it with danger,
[6144.00 - 6146.00] P:1910.05 E:0.115508 |  so it's well enough that they're good enough to strike
[6146.00 - 6148.00] P:1893.11 E:0.108749 |  and they can go and attack that.
[6148.00 - 6150.00] P:1854.67 E:0.115965 |  That was a little more than a half chance.
[6150.00 - 6153.00] P:1924.27 E:0.108490 |  But definitely, that's why they've end up this period, isn't it?
[6154.00 - 6156.00] P:1851.98 E:0.116110 |  Our friend in the green trousers
[6156.00 - 6158.00] P:1594.71 E:0.112435 |  is clapping his hands together once again.
[6158.00 - 6162.00] P:1711.01 E:0.106679 |  The noise is rising inside Education City,
[6162.00 - 6166.00] P:1764.65 E:0.091967 |  because Morocco very much still believe.
[6166.00 - 6169.00] P:1701.79 E:0.105579 |  Four minutes plus added time to play.
[6170.00 - 6172.00] P:1702.00 E:0.096852 |  Well, it's one of those parts.
[6172.00 - 6174.00] P:1659.14 E:0.106523 |  We know where a goal from Spain might come from.
[6174.00 - 6176.00] P:1687.99 E:0.098412 |  They've got enough players on the pitch,
[6176.00 - 6179.00] P:1586.23 E:0.105255 |  but looking at the game overall and the performance so far,
[6179.00 - 6181.00] P:1776.31 E:0.088564 |  it is still one of those where you think,
[6181.00 - 6183.00] P:1576.28 E:0.095219 |  where is this going to come from for Spain?
[6183.00 - 6185.00] P:1596.23 E:0.094222 |  You would not be surprised if, you know,
[6185.00 - 6188.00] P:2042.94 E:0.106596 |  obviously it's getting close to finishing now and now.
[6188.00 - 6191.00] P:2203.36 E:0.118408 |  Who wants to take a chance when it comes to, you know, extra time,
[6191.00 - 6193.00] P:2215.17 E:0.113827 |  against the extra time?
[6193.00 - 6195.00] P:2267.60 E:0.113422 |  Because then there's a fair factor.
[6195.00 - 6197.00] P:2257.96 E:0.119017 |  If you lose a goal there,
[6197.00 - 6199.00] P:2321.74 E:0.119787 |  you will always be the member for it.
[6199.00 - 6201.00] P:2340.32 E:0.114625 |  And that's an effect, it's a very, very negative effect.
[6201.00 - 6203.00] P:2241.45 E:0.106579 |  People shouldn't think that.
[6203.00 - 6204.00] P:2189.45 E:0.111358 |  We should think of the positive things,
[6204.00 - 6206.00] P:2135.07 E:0.111482 |  but we do it negatively sometimes.
[6206.00 - 6209.00] P:1834.09 E:0.114633 |  Here goes Nico Williams down the right-hand side.
[6209.00 - 6212.00] P:1857.23 E:0.101913 |  Very good covering for Morocco.
[6212.00 - 6214.00] P:1884.44 E:0.082520 |  And they'll clear away.
[6214.00 - 6216.00] P:1856.42 E:0.087434 |  We should be able to clear away.
[6216.00 - 6218.00] P:1697.72 E:0.105411 |  But Nico Williams has done well to charge that down.
[6218.00 - 6221.00] P:1944.33 E:0.096041 |  The substitute Atty at Alado plays it off him.
[6221.00 - 6223.00] P:1771.38 E:0.103761 |  And it's a throw to Morocco deep in their own territory.
[6223.00 - 6228.00] P:1787.02 E:0.087078 |  It's one of those, as Luis Enrique squats down on the edge of his technical area.
[6228.00 - 6232.00] P:1872.28 E:0.099190 |  I'm not in any way saying that Spain came into this match playing for penalties.
[6232.00 - 6235.00] P:1752.70 E:0.106508 |  But when you've told all your players to go and practice a thousand of them
[6235.00 - 6237.00] P:1628.41 E:0.113270 |  before you turn up for the World Cup,
[6237.00 - 6241.00] P:1749.85 E:0.104431 |  there's just not a sense that Spain are too bothered
[6241.00 - 6244.00] P:1774.71 E:0.106711 |  about pushing this to win it in normal time.
[6244.00 - 6246.00] P:2003.16 E:0.104282 |  The nice and Spanish win.
[6246.00 - 6248.00] P:2028.98 E:0.111318 |  Here come Morocco.
[6248.00 - 6252.00] P:1876.17 E:0.099461 |  And they find a way through the lights blue shirts
[6252.00 - 6255.00] P:1830.01 E:0.084991 |  of Spain's defence.
[6255.00 - 6257.00] P:1821.53 E:0.102085 |  Out to the right-hand side.
[6257.00 - 6259.00] P:1740.70 E:0.120092 |  They go nice and a wanton.
[6259.00 - 6263.00] P:1802.70 E:0.102646 |  Almost, but Anahi can't pick up that return ball.
[6263.00 - 6268.00] P:1881.49 E:0.092883 |  And Ashraf Hakimi looks to the heavens because that was so close.
[6268.00 - 6270.00] P:1774.87 E:0.101360 |  That was a beautiful play.
[6270.00 - 6273.00] P:1787.43 E:0.105922 |  When they get the one touch, the one-twos,
[6273.00 - 6275.00] P:1673.49 E:0.118479 |  and the final thubs, I say they don't have them very often.
[6275.00 - 6278.00] P:1771.82 E:0.114315 |  But when they do, they've got real belief in their ability.
[6278.00 - 6280.00] P:1821.13 E:0.108333 |  And that was just like a leg.
[6280.00 - 6284.00] P:1749.20 E:0.115185 |  He was exhausted and he just couldn't make it to the violin with a ball he didn't put.
[6284.00 - 6287.00] P:1957.41 E:0.104690 |  Here goes Spain, though, Alvaro Marata in behind,
[6287.00 - 6289.00] P:1994.30 E:0.109813 |  checks inside the penalty area, pulls it back.
[6289.00 - 6292.00] P:1921.17 E:0.111696 |  Nico Williams' excellent sliding block by Anahi,
[6292.00 - 6294.00] P:1900.51 E:0.109270 |  and it's cleared away by Morocco.
[6294.00 - 6297.00] P:1922.53 E:0.101038 |  Huge chance for Spain in the dying moments of this game.
[6297.00 - 6299.00] P:1723.40 E:0.106475 |  But once again, it's a striker's movement.
[6299.00 - 6301.00] P:1881.47 E:0.105973 |  You know, Marata will keep on doing that.
[6301.00 - 6304.00] P:1871.40 E:0.109613 |  Nico Wernst on the right-hand side, they've lifted the Spanish side.
[6304.00 - 6307.00] P:1967.74 E:0.092998 |  Now, I think the flag went up.
[6307.00 - 6309.00] P:1876.06 E:0.103365 |  I think the assistant got that one wrong.
[6309.00 - 6312.00] P:1867.07 E:0.105920 |  I think he was onside. I'm pretty confident he was onside there.
[6312.00 - 6317.00] P:1935.84 E:0.097274 |  So, you know, he's got a little bit of that unlucky there because the break was great.
[6317.00 - 6320.00] P:1787.61 E:0.091711 |  Maybe the... Actually, I was going to say, maybe it was the second movement,
[6320.00 - 6323.00] P:1686.06 E:0.104021 |  but I'm looking at where the three kicks were taken.
[6323.00 - 6325.00] P:1769.85 E:0.115669 |  And that's the initial movement.
[6325.00 - 6328.00] P:1758.77 E:0.112091 |  So, having said that, via I would have sorted out, wouldn't it?
[6329.00 - 6331.00] P:1785.73 E:0.111052 |  So, free kick to Morocco.
[6331.00 - 6334.00] P:1626.58 E:0.110408 |  Out to the right-hand side, they go with Ashraf Hakimi.
[6334.00 - 6336.00] P:1750.96 E:0.108051 |  Dani Almo wins the header.
[6336.00 - 6338.00] P:1487.66 E:0.105757 |  Throw to Morocco.
[6338.00 - 6342.00] P:1633.71 E:0.101163 |  Looking to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in their history.
[6342.00 - 6344.00] P:1750.75 E:0.081284 |  But I have a feeling...
[6344.00 - 6349.00] P:1700.43 E:0.096157 |  And I don't mind bringing in the commentators, because a late goal is always a joy for the neutral.
[6349.00 - 6352.00] P:1920.14 E:0.095331 |  But I have a feeling we're heading to extra time.
[6352.00 - 6354.00] P:2051.82 E:0.095691 |  What can Spain say about this, though?
[6354.00 - 6357.00] P:1981.95 E:0.106886 |  Soler, Marata, and suddenly it's all clicking for Spain.
[6357.00 - 6360.00] P:2130.83 E:0.112603 |  Dani Almo down the left-hand side.
[6360.00 - 6362.00] P:2185.22 E:0.108075 |  Was he put down there by Anahi?
[6362.00 - 6364.00] P:1894.25 E:0.107986 |  Yes, he was.
[6364.00 - 6367.00] P:1965.75 E:0.088437 |  And this will be a free kick to Spain.
[6367.00 - 6371.00] P:1846.39 E:0.086688 |  And a belated yellow card for Roman Saiz.
[6371.00 - 6376.00] P:1935.97 E:0.097136 |  He wasn't the player over there making the challenge, but the referee unhappy with something.
[6376.00 - 6382.00] P:2141.52 E:0.097118 |  The key thing for Spain is this is a great position, just outside the penalty area,
[6382.00 - 6389.00] P:2164.46 E:0.103766 |  midway between that 18-yard line and the byline level with the edge of the box.
[6389.00 - 6390.00] P:2103.95 E:0.110604 |  You know what?
[6390.00 - 6393.00] P:2096.23 E:0.109889 |  I know they love to play a lot of football, but...
[6393.00 - 6395.00] P:2145.95 E:0.099700 |  Come on, Spain, put it in the middle.
[6395.00 - 6397.00] P:2094.45 E:0.107797 |  Please, put a cross in there.
[6397.00 - 6399.00] P:2113.93 E:0.094342 |  Give your centre-back something to attack.
[6399.00 - 6401.00] P:2153.05 E:0.103256 |  Give Marata something to attack.
[6401.00 - 6403.00] P:2214.81 E:0.114665 |  There's only moments left of the game.
[6403.00 - 6406.00] P:2246.34 E:0.101449 |  You've got to give him a chance to attack something.
[6406.00 - 6410.00] P:2153.32 E:0.112282 |  So it's a two-man Morocco wall, the bright red shirt.
[6410.00 - 6417.00] P:2124.53 E:0.103748 |  It's just being orchestrated by Bono as we enter five minutes of added time.
[6417.00 - 6420.00] P:2035.54 E:0.114163 |  The referee had already done the spray, and then Bono said,
[6420.00 - 6424.00] P:2172.36 E:0.103434 |  no, actually, I want it slightly to the right, so the referee's done the spray again.
[6424.00 - 6431.00] P:2112.47 E:0.104768 |  So here we go, free kick to Spain, swung in by Soler, looking for the run at the far post.
[6431.00 - 6437.00] P:1953.04 E:0.105684 |  And that is a huge chance for Marata, completely unmarked, just got underneath it,
[6437.00 - 6442.00] P:1806.81 E:0.103810 |  sends it over the bar, the man who scored in every match at this World Cup for Spain.
[6442.00 - 6444.00] P:1979.81 E:0.077691 |  It goes begging.
[6444.00 - 6448.00] P:1935.18 E:0.103827 |  You know what? He cannot believe he's missed that so badly.
[6448.00 - 6452.00] P:1902.26 E:0.107695 |  He has got so much space, he's just ghosted around the back there.
[6452.00 - 6454.00] P:1925.60 E:0.108001 |  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[6454.00 - 6458.00] P:1904.27 E:0.092306 |  There's a neat little block to get in the space there, but it's not an easy angle.
[6458.00 - 6464.00] P:1873.71 E:0.090715 |  He's almost a corner of a six yard box, but really, he's got to get that in target.
[6464.00 - 6466.00] P:1755.70 E:0.091782 |  Was he even close to in target?
[6466.00 - 6469.00] P:1819.22 E:0.092829 |  Let's see if it's hit his nose and gone over the top.
[6469.00 - 6472.00] P:1936.81 E:0.112133 |  Headed forward by Morocco, Rodri's underneath it, strong back pass to Una.
[6472.00 - 6476.00] P:1961.32 E:0.102251 |  Una Simon, he takes a loose touch and just gets away with it.
[6476.00 - 6478.00] P:1973.81 E:0.087044 |  Goodness me.
[6478.00 - 6481.00] P:1736.16 E:0.093057 |  Hearts in mouths, moments for Spain.
[6481.00 - 6488.00] P:1775.73 E:0.099133 |  And Una Simon raises a hand of apology because he was closed down so quickly there by Ezzel Zuley.
[6488.00 - 6490.00] P:1826.19 E:0.077408 |  My word.
[6490.00 - 6492.00] P:1822.95 E:0.110772 |  I just love to get Ezzel Zuley on the ball.
[6492.00 - 6496.00] P:1930.30 E:0.100464 |  We've hardly seen him on the ball, but I've seen enough of his movement.
[6496.00 - 6498.00] P:2010.51 E:0.096111 |  He is lightning quick.
[6498.00 - 6504.00] P:1938.78 E:0.099631 |  I've no doubt he's got plenty of skill as well, but he's never so far in this game.
[6504.00 - 6506.00] P:1845.89 E:0.096217 |  Manus to get a one-on-one with Valenti.
[6506.00 - 6510.00] P:2063.04 E:0.090505 |  And if he does, I'm back and you cared this thing.
[6510.00 - 6516.00] P:2145.30 E:0.101184 |  Now, Elio Mics gone down, and the free kick has gone Morocco's way.
[6516.00 - 6520.00] P:2095.29 E:0.096801 |  Avarro Morassar, it was involved.
[6520.00 - 6526.00] P:1841.81 E:0.095317 |  Just watching there because the Morocco manager, Waleed Regragi, has come over.
[6526.00 - 6533.00] P:1728.02 E:0.101484 |  He's pulled away a member of his own coaching staff, or I think was going to go and tend to Elio Mique.
[6533.00 - 6535.00] P:1726.67 E:0.103529 |  Elio Mique's now back up to his feet.
[6535.00 - 6541.00] P:1803.06 E:0.089995 |  So, Morocco very much looking to push in these final few moments.
[6541.00 - 6543.00] P:1828.34 E:0.097840 |  They're not playing for extra time.
[6543.00 - 6548.00] P:1925.55 E:0.093104 |  Of course, if this ball comes straight back at them, they'll drop back into that defensive shape.
[6548.00 - 6552.00] P:1822.37 E:0.102628 |  But interesting there that Regragi wanting things to get moving quickly,
[6552.00 - 6555.00] P:1881.81 E:0.109764 |  and the ball in, he's headed on inside the area.
[6555.00 - 6559.00] P:1927.24 E:0.109776 |  Misku, they'll try and go for it, and Ines Simon makes the save.
[6559.00 - 6565.00] P:1832.36 E:0.095364 |  The whistle's already gone, but again, it's Severe and Shadira in there.
[6565.00 - 6566.00] P:1883.25 E:0.115792 |  And the Misku from Shadira.
[6566.00 - 6569.00] P:1862.15 E:0.110083 |  I mean, that's as bad as the miss from Morassar at the other end.
[6569.00 - 6573.00] P:2122.20 E:0.095245 |  Yeah, but it's well offside, and I think there was no doubt it was offside.
[6573.00 - 6574.00] P:1985.98 E:0.103276 |  They had to play it through.
[6574.00 - 6577.00] P:2099.66 E:0.089306 |  But, you know, we do talk about high lanes now and again.
[6577.00 - 6579.00] P:2044.19 E:0.097170 |  It can get a bit tiresome.
[6579.00 - 6583.00] P:2095.09 E:0.093753 |  But that was stupidly high, wasn't it, from the Spanish side?
[6583.00 - 6586.00] P:2173.11 E:0.109134 |  And hardly ran a man from deep there and played the right ball,
[6586.00 - 6590.00] P:2326.80 E:0.109703 |  and that would have been one-on-one with Severe and it wouldn't have been offside.
[6590.00 - 6592.00] P:2269.41 E:0.112603 |  It was swapped for how high that lane was.
[6593.00 - 6595.00] P:2207.43 E:0.114223 |  So, Spain in possession.
[6595.00 - 6601.00] P:2240.25 E:0.113893 |  We played three of the minimum five minutes added on at the end of this last 16 tie.
[6601.00 - 6607.00] P:2255.82 E:0.108438 |  We're heading to extra time, unless either side can fashion a chance late on.
[6607.00 - 6610.00] P:2281.02 E:0.110819 |  Unaissimon plays it out to Rodri.
[6610.00 - 6618.00] P:2294.98 E:0.110856 |  Shadira, the tall striker from Morocco, just looking, moving around on the halfway line.
[6618.00 - 6620.00] P:2338.66 E:0.108238 |  But Spain will play it out to this left-hand side.
[6620.00 - 6622.00] P:2290.47 E:0.117353 |  But as Pat says, they won't force it.
[6622.00 - 6629.00] P:2366.96 E:0.108820 |  Can they find one more opportunity to try and unlock this red wall of Moroccan shirts?
[6629.00 - 6634.00] P:2065.52 E:0.110848 |  Out to the right-hand side, they go, and Nico Williams could put in on the far side by Azazouli.
[6634.00 - 6637.00] P:1859.38 E:0.102710 |  He felt Morocco should have the throw as well, but it's gone the way of Spain,
[6637.00 - 6642.00] P:2267.24 E:0.107867 |  taken by Nico Williams in field now to Imaricla Porte,
[6642.00 - 6647.00] P:2357.43 E:0.111693 |  out to the left-hand side and Jordi Alba into the final minute of added time.
[6647.00 - 6650.00] P:2276.75 E:0.110672 |  A goal now, surely breaks Moroccan hearts.
[6650.00 - 6654.00] P:2090.79 E:0.107264 |  So, Spain come forward, Danny almost gone down, and he's won the free kick.
[6654.00 - 6658.00] P:1836.13 E:0.100316 |  And again, this is a good position, just up from the penalty area.
[6658.00 - 6662.00] P:1918.19 E:0.079893 |  12 yards or so, wide left.
[6662.00 - 6666.00] P:2013.85 E:0.092458 |  And Spain, we have to say Pat, have been invented from their set pieces.
[6666.00 - 6667.00] P:1996.38 E:0.109590 |  What will they try this time?
[6667.00 - 6670.00] P:2091.17 E:0.101348 |  Yeah, I mean, the last one worked very, very well.
[6670.00 - 6673.00] P:2136.03 E:0.101653 |  And when I took it on, it got the header, nice little block,
[6673.00 - 6676.00] P:2241.01 E:0.107939 |  you went to the back post, do they have an understanding there?
[6676.00 - 6680.00] P:2196.54 E:0.115606 |  The idea, normally, from this position, is just to put it on in an angle with the back post
[6680.00 - 6682.00] P:2210.84 E:0.104005 |  and let players attack it.
[6682.00 - 6685.00] P:2121.83 E:0.110303 |  A goal now, surely sends Spain through to the quarter-finals,
[6685.00 - 6689.00] P:1879.84 E:0.114270 |  and it almost went all the way through from Danny Olmo.
[6689.00 - 6692.00] P:1832.00 E:0.105872 |  The runners were in there, Bono didn't take his eye off the ball,
[6692.00 - 6695.00] P:1895.91 E:0.105202 |  and he shoveled it behind for a corner.
[6695.00 - 6699.00] P:2033.79 E:0.101712 |  Oh, Spain almost catching out Morocco, right at the end of this match.
[6699.00 - 6702.00] P:2134.52 E:0.114571 |  That's exactly what the ball described, and that's exactly what the ball split out.
[6702.00 - 6705.00] P:2284.08 E:0.112364 |  It was played brilliantly, well done, Bono.
[6705.00 - 6707.00] P:2241.07 E:0.108867 |  Corner to Spain from the far side.
[6707.00 - 6709.00] P:2047.87 E:0.108123 |  This surely will be the last action of the game.
[6709.00 - 6712.00] P:1942.50 E:0.101848 |  LePort with the header stabbed away by Morocco.
[6712.00 - 6714.00] P:1834.26 E:0.106671 |  It'll bounce out, will it go out for the corner?
[6714.00 - 6717.00] P:1954.61 E:0.103645 |  No, it hits the corner flag and goes out for the throw,
[6717.00 - 6721.00] P:2003.16 E:0.098653 |  but there will not be time to take it.
[6721.00 - 6724.00] P:1966.63 E:0.100507 |  0-0 after 90 minutes.
[6724.00 - 6726.00] P:1918.43 E:0.110858 |  Extra time here we come. Pat Nevin.
[6726.00 - 6730.00] P:1758.03 E:0.104785 |  Yeah, and just to hope that some people get a goal,
[6730.00 - 6733.00] P:1704.07 E:0.102646 |  because I'm not sure the entire game deserves a goal,
[6733.00 - 6736.00] P:1629.16 E:0.106593 |  but at the moment there are a lot of tired players out there,
[6736.00 - 6739.00] P:1797.98 E:0.094224 |  and it may well be it's the least tired players,
[6739.00 - 6743.00] P:1766.08 E:0.085060 |  not the best players who actually end up winning this game of football.
[6743.00 - 6745.00] P:1962.57 E:0.086957 |  Here we go then, Mark.
[6745.00 - 6747.00] P:1702.21 E:0.096679 |  It's half an hour of extra time to come.
[6747.00 - 6750.00] P:1725.38 E:0.084586 |  After 90, it's Morocco 0, Spain 0.
[6750.00 - 6756.00] P:1796.36 E:0.078700 |  And we'll get to that extra time after the latest BBC News with Jill McKenzie.
[6756.00 - 6760.00] P:1411.15 E:0.122667 |  Take the World Cup with you, Qatar 2022.
[6760.00 - 6765.00] P:1642.06 E:0.109904 |  On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[6765.00 - 6766.00] P:1469.32 E:0.108842 |  Thanks, Mark.
[6766.00 - 6768.00] P:1179.34 E:0.099110 |  Thousands of ambulance workers across England and Wales
[6768.00 - 6770.00] P:1739.42 E:0.084870 |  are going to go on strike on the 21st of December
[6770.00 - 6773.00] P:1864.10 E:0.077387 |  in a dispute of repair and patient safety.
[6773.00 - 6776.00] P:1514.11 E:0.102444 |  The coordinated walkout by the GMB Unison and Unite Unions
[6776.00 - 6780.00] P:1829.76 E:0.070498 |  will only affect non-life-threatening calls.
[6780.00 - 6783.00] P:1432.39 E:0.092235 |  Further talks have been held between the RMT Union and rail companies
[6783.00 - 6785.00] P:1899.37 E:0.078538 |  to try to avert further strikes.
[6785.00 - 6788.00] P:1637.06 E:0.093231 |  An additional walkout between Christmas Eve and the 27th of December
[6788.00 - 6790.00] P:1828.08 E:0.079546 |  was announced yesterday.
[6790.00 - 6793.00] P:1673.70 E:0.098419 |  Eight days of industrial action in the Rye White pair
[6793.00 - 6795.00] P:1644.84 E:0.090613 |  and conditions had already been confirmed for next week
[6795.00 - 6797.00] P:1799.38 E:0.063392 |  and the start of January.
[6797.00 - 6800.00] P:1625.18 E:0.090644 |  Nine children across the UK and I know to have died from an illness
[6800.00 - 6803.00] P:1891.32 E:0.079332 |  linked to the bacterial infection Strepe A.
[6803.00 - 6805.00] P:1541.73 E:0.088556 |  The latest victims are five-year-old from Belfast
[6805.00 - 6807.00] P:1311.17 E:0.085761 |  called Stella Lily McCorkindale.
[6807.00 - 6809.00] P:1759.60 E:0.078839 |  And the Conservative peer, Lady Mone,
[6809.00 - 6811.00] P:1458.66 E:0.093297 |  has taken a leave of absence from the House of Lords.
[6811.00 - 6813.00] P:2125.88 E:0.088908 |  She's been linked to PPE Med Pro,
[6813.00 - 6815.00] P:1552.56 E:0.095536 |  which is a company which won government contracts
[6815.00 - 6817.00] P:1578.06 E:0.087626 |  during the COVID pandemic.
[6817.00 - 6819.00] P:2014.37 E:0.081514 |  But her lawyers have previously said she had no role
[6819.00 - 6821.00] P:1738.39 E:0.080583 |  or function in the firm.
[6821.00 - 6824.00] P:1668.95 E:0.080118 |  Her spokesperson says she's now focusing on clearing her name.
[6824.00 - 6826.00] P:1833.94 E:0.097850 |  That's right, and the news headlines now.
[6826.00 - 6828.00] P:1491.59 E:0.093840 |  Time to take a look at the travel. Here's Orner.
[6829.00 - 6831.00] P:1369.86 E:0.113701 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[6831.00 - 6835.00] P:1615.25 E:0.110459 |  Listen live on digital, online, smart speaker,

[6837.00 - 6840.00] P:1275.98 E:0.106842 |  Thanks, Lisa. So the M8 in Glasgow queuing on the eastbound side,
[6840.00 - 6844.00] P:1564.47 E:0.099183 |  that's from 26th at Hillington to the M74 interchange at Junction 20.
[6844.00 - 6846.00] P:1562.15 E:0.094497 |  It's after an accident.
[6846.00 - 6848.00] P:1162.19 E:0.101647 |  The M4 in South Wales queuing around Cardiff,
[6848.00 - 6852.00] P:1258.02 E:0.103218 |  24th at the Caldera, heading towards 29th at the A48M interchange.
[6852.00 - 6855.00] P:1162.84 E:0.105567 |  Now that's because of the westbound side where the vehicle overturned.
[6855.00 - 6857.00] P:1138.61 E:0.092680 |  There's still one lane closed at the scene.
[6857.00 - 6859.00] P:1367.63 E:0.113562 |  The M1 Sloan North found at Junction 38 at Woolley.
[6859.00 - 6862.00] P:1184.80 E:0.091787 |  That's emergency repairs with one lane closed.
[6862.00 - 6865.00] P:1121.14 E:0.109490 |  And still problems on the train through Wolverhampton and Birmingham
[6865.00 - 6866.00] P:940.18 E:0.091067 |  because of the warehouse fires.
[6866.00 - 6868.00] P:1080.45 E:0.090395 |  One imagined 5 Live travel.
[6887.00 - 6890.00] P:1376.91 E:0.122277 |  I don't care if it's been half a century or half an hour,
[6890.00 - 6892.00] P:1452.99 E:0.124729 |  that man has to pay for what he did to her.
[6892.00 - 6896.00] P:1536.38 E:0.117552 |  If anyone asks, I'll say you should be here till you rot.
[6896.00 - 6899.00] P:1499.54 E:0.089808 |  Star Sunday night on BBC Eyed Layer.
[6909.00 - 6911.00] P:1687.47 E:0.074115 |  And thank you to Lisa McCormack for the news.
[6911.00 - 6913.00] P:1859.13 E:0.076345 |  Not Jill McKenzie.
[6913.00 - 6916.00] P:1846.66 E:0.078553 |  Very difficult to tell who the news reader is from over here in Doha.
[6916.00 - 6919.00] P:1680.41 E:0.087481 |  Right, let's... I'll stick to that excuse.
[6919.00 - 6923.00] P:1816.05 E:0.085252 |  Right, let's bring in Guillem Balagay-Golus after 90 minutes.
[6923.00 - 6926.00] P:1988.61 E:0.080772 |  Spain's last four knockout games at major tournaments
[6926.00 - 6929.00] P:1964.51 E:0.079421 |  have all gone to extra time, so we shouldn't be surprised, Guillem.
[6929.00 - 6934.00] P:2024.79 E:0.063714 |  Yes, because we do like that kind of player that stops this happening.
[6934.00 - 6937.00] P:1915.75 E:0.081684 |  But at least the strikers on, they add a little bit of edge.
[6937.00 - 6941.00] P:1936.77 E:0.082020 |  Nico Williams on the right-hand side helps with runs on the right wing.
[6941.00 - 6944.00] P:1943.13 E:0.059846 |  But Spain likes a little bit of continuity.
[6944.00 - 6947.00] P:2021.69 E:0.088954 |  We were searching for a space before, now for the move
[6947.00 - 6950.00] P:1778.75 E:0.051417 |  that makes the difference mostly down the wing.
[6950.00 - 6953.00] P:1824.35 E:0.074775 |  And Morocco, they liked the quality in the last decision,
[6953.00 - 6957.00] P:2040.61 E:0.070764 |  but I don't know if it's maybe in Spanish, but they have paced, they combine well,
[6957.00 - 6960.00] P:1756.38 E:0.078904 |  and there is a sense of danger when they're next to the box.
[6960.00 - 6963.00] P:2167.19 E:0.073588 |  It's just that I feel that generally, at this stage of the competition,
[6963.00 - 6966.00] P:1676.46 E:0.077968 |  when you need more things, there's an alarming lack of layers
[6966.00 - 6971.00] P:1854.61 E:0.059539 |  and alternatives from Spain with teams that defend as compact
[6972.00 - 6975.00] P:1508.04 E:0.062915 |  and as disciplined as Morocco have done today.
[6975.00 - 6979.00] P:1903.79 E:0.060924 |  Was it better for you, Pat Nevin, Spain's second half performance?
[6979.00 - 6982.00] P:1790.86 E:0.095933 |  Mildly, tiny bit.
[6982.00 - 6984.00] P:1831.45 E:0.103569 |  I think Guillem's absolutely right.
[6984.00 - 6986.00] P:1572.25 E:0.090501 |  It's not that the performance is there,
[6986.00 - 6990.00] P:1760.47 E:0.088260 |  it's the substitutions that have adapted it and made it better and made it...
[6990.00 - 6994.00] P:1718.95 E:0.097320 |  You've got a focus now, you've got somebody who makes normal strikers' runs.
[6994.00 - 6997.00] P:1867.32 E:0.090630 |  You've got a white player who actually tries to beat somebody.
[6997.00 - 7000.00] P:1504.62 E:0.102519 |  Wow! So Nico Williams has made a big difference as well.
[7000.00 - 7006.00] P:1777.52 E:0.087780 |  So yeah, a little bit better, but I can see what Guillem was talking about beforehand.
[7006.00 - 7010.00] P:1765.05 E:0.079571 |  He wasn't hyper-excited with things, and yeah, I get it, mate.
[7013.00 - 7015.00] P:1837.28 E:0.088173 |  I'm on my fifth cup of tea.
[7015.00 - 7018.00] P:1814.37 E:0.080279 |  Your fifth, did you say?
[7018.00 - 7021.00] P:1761.29 E:0.082656 |  Yeah, because you know you're going to go, you're going to come back
[7021.00 - 7023.00] P:1756.27 E:0.068864 |  and nothing would have happened, so...
[7025.00 - 7028.00] P:1772.50 E:0.079729 |  Where is Morocco's threat going to come from, Pat,
[7028.00 - 7032.00] P:1762.24 E:0.085063 |  in this second half, in this period of extra time?
[7032.00 - 7034.00] P:1767.43 E:0.097176 |  Well, the broadcast is a period on.
[7034.00 - 7038.00] P:1759.30 E:0.094392 |  The hazards really, is your young player, the brook and the left wing, right?
[7038.00 - 7041.00] P:1821.77 E:0.095290 |  And it's one of those things, and now and again I see a player,
[7041.00 - 7044.00] P:1927.80 E:0.081610 |  and I think I've not actually seen you touch the ball,
[7044.00 - 7049.00] P:1967.58 E:0.091561 |  but boy, you look the right pace, you look the right attitude,
[7049.00 - 7053.00] P:1805.70 E:0.084893 |  so it may well be that the head and the left hand side is the biggest threat.
[7053.00 - 7054.00] P:1897.01 E:0.056995 |  We shall see.
[7054.00 - 7055.00] P:1621.10 E:0.091164 |  All right, Guillem, thank you.
[7055.00 - 7059.00] P:2019.52 E:0.086080 |  Back on the way, I know for definite this is Vicky Sparks.
[7059.00 - 7062.00] P:2120.15 E:0.096984 |  Thanks very much, Mark Chatlin.
[7062.00 - 7064.00] P:2114.66 E:0.105833 |  Out to the left-hand side, go Spain.
[7064.00 - 7067.00] P:2169.80 E:0.091670 |  As we get underway in extra time,
[7067.00 - 7071.00] P:2105.22 E:0.102004 |  Jordi Alba picks it up, Spain playing from right to left,
[7071.00 - 7073.00] P:2086.82 E:0.098645 |  0-0 it finished after the 90.
[7073.00 - 7077.00] P:2156.42 E:0.084812 |  Spain in the light blue shirts with the change kit,
[7077.00 - 7079.00] P:2064.31 E:0.091711 |  the white shorts and the light blue socks,
[7079.00 - 7082.00] P:2137.81 E:0.090759 |  Morocco in the bright red shirts,
[7082.00 - 7085.00] P:2005.16 E:0.089218 |  the green shorts and the bright red socks,
[7085.00 - 7088.00] P:2027.74 E:0.098753 |  and Morocco, friend in the green trousers,
[7088.00 - 7092.00] P:2123.92 E:0.095151 |  has just had a little break in between normal time and extra time,
[7092.00 - 7097.00] P:2093.13 E:0.095280 |  but he's getting ready to start up the Moroccan choir once again.
[7097.00 - 7101.00] P:2085.02 E:0.090936 |  Spain in possession inside their own half.
[7101.00 - 7105.00] P:2176.77 E:0.091298 |  Morocco, who have enjoyed such an outstanding tournament here,
[7105.00 - 7110.00] P:2052.48 E:0.082430 |  looking to reach the last eight for the first time in their history.
[7110.00 - 7114.00] P:1867.91 E:0.103285 |  What can they do in extra time early on against Spain,
[7114.00 - 7116.00] P:1782.92 E:0.088470 |  as Shadira approaches the penalty area,
[7116.00 - 7119.00] P:1860.95 E:0.099064 |  trying to latch onto that ball over the top from Ziesh.
[7119.00 - 7122.00] P:1878.29 E:0.097051 |  It's cleared away by Llorente up to Nico Williams.
[7122.00 - 7126.00] P:1750.53 E:0.094318 |  Morocco will win it back, but illegally so over on the far side
[7126.00 - 7131.00] P:1965.33 E:0.082817 |  with Ezol Zuli and Spain in possession mid-way through their own half.
[7131.00 - 7135.00] P:2074.87 E:0.095984 |  So Morocco with Bono in goal, the back four now of Hakimi,
[7135.00 - 7139.00] P:2116.95 E:0.095906 |  El Yamec, Saiz and Atiat-Ala ahead of them at Tsunahi,
[7139.00 - 7146.00] P:1976.12 E:0.079536 |  Amrabat and Sabiri with Ziesh, Shadira and Ezol Zuli up top
[7146.00 - 7150.00] P:1826.42 E:0.092846 |  as the throw goes to Spain on the far side,
[7150.00 - 7152.00] P:1648.62 E:0.093520 |  and they have it just outside the centre circle.
[7152.00 - 7155.00] P:1785.66 E:0.103804 |  Spain with Simon in goal, the back four of Llorente,
[7155.00 - 7159.00] P:1934.04 E:0.077806 |  Rodri, Le Porte and Albert ahead of them.
[7159.00 - 7164.00] P:1840.00 E:0.079137 |  It's Pedri, Busquets and Soleir with Nico Williams,
[7164.00 - 7169.00] P:1805.55 E:0.078020 |  Daniomo and now Alvaro Marata up top.
[7169.00 - 7172.00] P:1782.80 E:0.107603 |  Most of them get the ball a bit more often to Alvaro Marata.
[7172.00 - 7175.00] P:1967.07 E:0.096498 |  You know he's capable of scoring, you know he'll make the right runs.
[7175.00 - 7178.00] P:2168.51 E:0.102716 |  If you put it into the right area, he'll get there.
[7178.00 - 7180.00] P:2232.09 E:0.107334 |  He's shown it already twice, he's had a head at the back post,
[7180.00 - 7183.00] P:2322.95 E:0.112983 |  he should have done better with, and also he's a run through
[7183.00 - 7187.00] P:2266.97 E:0.103359 |  where I don't think it was offside and he didn't make the best of the chance.
[7187.00 - 7190.00] P:2286.02 E:0.117220 |  But he's been just about the only player that Spansha had.
[7190.00 - 7192.00] P:2226.50 E:0.112088 |  He's been willing to go there and hurt himself
[7192.00 - 7196.00] P:2054.72 E:0.091861 |  to get into the dangerous areas and at Moroccan defence.
[7196.00 - 7202.00] P:1928.58 E:0.092143 |  Here are Zee Esch and Ashraf Hakimi linking up nicely down the right-hand side.
[7202.00 - 7204.00] P:1681.72 E:0.107967 |  Borgo's out of play for a Morocco throw
[7204.00 - 7209.00] P:1861.69 E:0.094615 |  and there's a little hand-clasped there between Luis Enrique and Hakim Zee Esch
[7209.00 - 7211.00] P:1732.73 E:0.106072 |  who almost bundled the Spain manager over
[7211.00 - 7213.00] P:1941.79 E:0.112979 |  and Le Porte taking his eye off the ball there.
[7213.00 - 7215.00] P:2104.99 E:0.098310 |  It does just keep it in and prevent the corner.
[7215.00 - 7218.00] P:2142.81 E:0.103608 |  It feels to me nice to see him on as Zee Esch drifts into this central position
[7218.00 - 7224.00] P:1963.95 E:0.100536 |  and now as Azuli will close down Rodri who clears long over the half-way line.
[7224.00 - 7228.00] P:1842.51 E:0.106872 |  If you're Morocco then, if you're their manager, Waliid Regragi,
[7228.00 - 7230.00] P:1850.37 E:0.087136 |  what's your game plan for extra time, Pat?
[7230.00 - 7236.00] P:1845.18 E:0.090702 |  More of the same, roughly, but the hope that there are some slightly older players
[7236.00 - 7239.00] P:1857.59 E:0.096399 |  and that's in the Spanish side, particularly maybe at the back.
[7239.00 - 7242.00] P:1728.74 E:0.084568 |  There's a couple that I've had long seasons and they've found it,
[7242.00 - 7244.00] P:1867.97 E:0.081448 |  may find it a little bit difficult.
[7244.00 - 7247.00] P:1942.62 E:0.087634 |  So make sure when you do get that break, that final ball,
[7247.00 - 7250.00] P:1863.20 E:0.086358 |  that final ball has to be much, much better.
[7250.00 - 7255.00] P:1851.73 E:0.087759 |  Zee Esch has been okay, but again, his final ball hasn't been up to very, very best standard.
[7255.00 - 7259.00] P:1851.30 E:0.083444 |  But you might only get one chance. You better take it.
[7260.00 - 7265.00] P:1946.10 E:0.099577 |  Ball forward looking for Zee Esch, but laterally the free kick is given against Hakim Zee Esch
[7265.00 - 7267.00] P:1903.11 E:0.103008 |  and that's one of those who has gone down.
[7267.00 - 7269.00] P:1938.38 E:0.096322 |  He feels it's a free kick in the referee's side.
[7269.00 - 7272.00] P:2014.59 E:0.091500 |  No, it's going to go the other way.
[7272.00 - 7273.00] P:2069.09 E:0.103021 |  He's really annoying the referee.
[7273.00 - 7277.00] P:2050.07 E:0.087599 |  He's just kicked the ball away again when he's sitting on the ground
[7277.00 - 7279.00] P:2126.43 E:0.110833 |  and you can't deal with that just now.
[7279.00 - 7282.00] P:2086.22 E:0.097065 |  He's walking back. He's not getting himself back into position.
[7282.00 - 7285.00] P:2131.36 E:0.107639 |  And at the moment, you know, if you're walking about in a little huff
[7285.00 - 7288.00] P:2220.92 E:0.109316 |  and your team loses a goal and you've got to walk up
[7288.00 - 7291.00] P:2290.82 E:0.094984 |  because you're in a bit of a bad mood, it's unacceptable.
[7291.00 - 7293.00] P:2095.17 E:0.119332 |  Well, he's not on a yellow card, Hakim Zee Esch,
[7293.00 - 7296.00] P:2261.38 E:0.104124 |  but the point is, under another referee, he might well be.
[7296.00 - 7299.00] P:2150.93 E:0.107166 |  Jordi Alba plays the ball to the edge of the D.
[7299.00 - 7303.00] P:1815.26 E:0.096358 |  That was tempted layoff towards Busquets from Carlos Soleir,
[7303.00 - 7305.00] P:1819.08 E:0.095372 |  but Morocco get the interception
[7305.00 - 7308.00] P:1626.65 E:0.089307 |  and Zee Esch has it out on the right-hand side.
[7308.00 - 7313.00] P:1870.92 E:0.093111 |  0-0, four minutes gone in extra time here on 5-5, BVC sounds.
[7313.00 - 7315.00] P:1636.41 E:0.109578 |  And across Africa on the BVC World Service.
[7315.00 - 7318.00] P:1730.00 E:0.108989 |  And here you go, Morocco in behind is Shadira.
[7318.00 - 7320.00] P:1756.41 E:0.111510 |  The flag stays down. Shadira, brilliant challenge
[7320.00 - 7323.00] P:1674.80 E:0.104476 |  as the flag now goes up on this near side.
[7323.00 - 7326.00] P:1843.16 E:0.097335 |  But what excellent defending by La Porte.
[7326.00 - 7328.00] P:1783.77 E:0.106090 |  Again, he didn't know the flag was going to go up.
[7328.00 - 7332.00] P:1911.40 E:0.095127 |  Neither did Shadira, and really, he should have sucked that away,
[7332.00 - 7334.00] P:1777.87 E:0.086658 |  but La Porte superb defending.
[7334.00 - 7338.00] P:1921.55 E:0.088692 |  Jouan, I think he is offside, but it's a shoulder
[7338.00 - 7341.00] P:1970.49 E:0.094282 |  or a bit of the chest, something like that.
[7341.00 - 7343.00] P:2070.23 E:0.104745 |  There's not much in it. Trying to bend his one run,
[7343.00 - 7347.00] P:2101.47 E:0.103748 |  didn't bend it quite enough, but that's a little bit of a freiner.
[7347.00 - 7350.00] P:2190.42 E:0.103905 |  That's a little bit of a wakerer for that defence.
[7350.00 - 7353.00] P:2208.63 E:0.098678 |  They got back in time, and of course, he's not lightning quick,
[7353.00 - 7357.00] P:2207.07 E:0.093594 |  but you cannot give them that many chances.
[7357.00 - 7361.00] P:2203.29 E:0.106210 |  Jordi Alba in possession on the halfway line for Spain.
[7361.00 - 7365.00] P:2178.02 E:0.103430 |  Goalless in extra time in this round of 16-time.
[7365.00 - 7368.00] P:2283.38 E:0.102454 |  The Spain working out to the right-hand side,
[7368.00 - 7371.00] P:2285.82 E:0.106295 |  and Nico Williams here is Llorente now, looking for options.
[7371.00 - 7375.00] P:2164.30 E:0.098336 |  Plays it forward from Marasa, challenge for Saiz, stays down.
[7375.00 - 7378.00] P:2025.14 E:0.097030 |  And the decision is free kick to Spain,
[7378.00 - 7381.00] P:1828.34 E:0.088474 |  and Raymond Saiz just grimaces in frustration.
[7381.00 - 7385.00] P:1739.58 E:0.081075 |  Spain with the set piece midway through the Morocco half-right-hand side.
[7385.00 - 7389.00] P:1962.66 E:0.087664 |  He's got himself in front of the defender there, so it is a free kick.
[7389.00 - 7391.00] P:1971.67 E:0.094094 |  He didn't really need the rolling about,
[7391.00 - 7395.00] P:2401.99 E:0.106449 |  but he's got the free kick, and he's actually given a little roll-five to the defender.
[7395.00 - 7399.00] P:2335.13 E:0.106801 |  Well, he's up now, Marasa, just ambling towards the penalty area.
[7399.00 - 7404.00] P:2316.52 E:0.096422 |  Marasa, who has scored in every World Cup match so far,
[7404.00 - 7407.00] P:2329.12 E:0.109763 |  can he find the breakthrough for Spain?
[7407.00 - 7410.00] P:2294.82 E:0.105964 |  Chances have been largely few and far between
[7410.00 - 7415.00] P:2296.85 E:0.096789 |  that Dani Almo free kick, locked deceiving Bono in the Moroccan goal
[7415.00 - 7419.00] P:2285.24 E:0.095720 |  right at the end of normal time.
[7419.00 - 7422.00] P:2017.34 E:0.112666 |  As the ball is chipped over into the area, looking for Nico Williams.
[7422.00 - 7425.00] P:2012.30 E:0.102623 |  Well, headed away by Morocco and Natiaz-Ala.
[7425.00 - 7428.00] P:2123.01 E:0.097541 |  He's not the tallest at all, the left back,
[7428.00 - 7431.00] P:2278.26 E:0.092558 |  but good leap there to clear the ball away.
[7431.00 - 7435.00] P:2274.78 E:0.099914 |  The Spain have it once more with Pedri, looking for the run through the centre.
[7435.00 - 7438.00] P:1967.04 E:0.105921 |  The header this time run by Saiz will come out to Nico Williams,
[7438.00 - 7442.00] P:2052.29 E:0.100348 |  right-hand side of the box, very well stood up by Morocco
[7442.00 - 7444.00] P:1828.70 E:0.109839 |  on the edge of their own penalty area,
[7444.00 - 7447.00] P:2014.73 E:0.100605 |  and Azuli will try and latch onto it, defended well by Spain.
[7447.00 - 7450.00] P:2122.34 E:0.100817 |  They have a touch from Puskets, out to the right-hand side,
[7450.00 - 7452.00] P:2242.81 E:0.107389 |  and Llorente, here is Nico Williams once more,
[7452.00 - 7454.00] P:2153.26 E:0.108361 |  approaching the penalty area, nice bit of skills,
[7454.00 - 7457.00] P:1979.19 E:0.109076 |  getting down to the bar line, pulls the ball across just over the head of Marasa,
[7457.00 - 7462.00] P:1904.87 E:0.091486 |  and it's cleared away by Aljamik, and out to the right-hand side,
[7462.00 - 7464.00] P:2141.81 E:0.100476 |  where Llorente will pick it up for Spain.
[7464.00 - 7467.00] P:1988.25 E:0.104436 |  Nico Williams wants more good battle going on there
[7467.00 - 7470.00] P:1710.50 E:0.105258 |  between him and the Morocco left-back Atiyah Salah,
[7470.00 - 7472.00] P:1764.88 E:0.089688 |  and Atiyah Salah gets the better of him.
[7472.00 - 7474.00] P:1494.67 E:0.106740 |  That time it's out from Morocco, throw nil-nil.
[7474.00 - 7478.00] P:1825.76 E:0.104806 |  But it's another very, very good piece of play down the right-hand side.
[7478.00 - 7482.00] P:1902.00 E:0.099708 |  Williams has done far more in this game than the players he replaced,
[7482.00 - 7485.00] P:1880.97 E:0.102892 |  and he's been up for much, much less time,
[7485.00 - 7487.00] P:1762.46 E:0.097856 |  so he can hold his head high.
[7487.00 - 7490.00] P:1860.57 E:0.089477 |  He's done well, whatever happens in the end of this game.
[7490.00 - 7494.00] P:1884.25 E:0.094581 |  So a double change coming up for Spain.
[7494.00 - 7501.00] P:1843.68 E:0.085593 |  Andro Balde and Anso Fatih are coming on for Dani Almo and Jordi Alba.
[7501.00 - 7508.00] P:1701.70 E:0.094683 |  A reminder that both sides have the opportunity to make an extra substitution in extra time.
[7508.00 - 7511.00] P:1767.12 E:0.089881 |  So Spain now up to five.
[7511.00 - 7514.00] P:1684.78 E:0.097762 |  Morocco had already made their five in normal time,
[7514.00 - 7520.00] P:1670.93 E:0.085479 |  so both will get one more, should they wish to use it in Spain again?
[7520.00 - 7527.00] P:1780.53 E:0.087822 |  Just shaking things up with personnel as they have it just inside their own half.
[7527.00 - 7531.00] P:2261.33 E:0.099420 |  Nil-nil here on five live, BBC Sounds,
[7531.00 - 7538.00] P:2240.15 E:0.104184 |  and across Africa on the BBC World Service as Rodgery plays it out to the right-hand side,
[7538.00 - 7541.00] P:1956.16 E:0.095408 |  and Nico Williams, he won't keep on to it,
[7541.00 - 7546.00] P:1913.08 E:0.081837 |  and there's Alzuli does well down the left, Morocco in the throw.
[7546.00 - 7550.00] P:1747.08 E:0.089485 |  At the moment, I don't think you can call it who's more likely to score
[7550.00 - 7554.00] P:1881.03 E:0.088109 |  because of the breaking capabilities of the Moroccans,
[7554.00 - 7557.00] P:1842.59 E:0.092895 |  because they've already done it in this competition.
[7557.00 - 7561.00] P:1824.06 E:0.101736 |  Because the Spanish, you wonder if they're ever going to get desperate,
[7561.00 - 7567.00] P:1944.51 E:0.087298 |  or if they're actually that comfortable with the penalty kicks, with the possibility of penalty kicks.
[7567.00 - 7569.00] P:2134.69 E:0.113600 |  One big thing they'll say, they've made another couple of changes now,
[7569.00 - 7571.00] P:2144.96 E:0.089952 |  that should liven it up a little bit.
[7571.00 - 7573.00] P:2331.88 E:0.101547 |  Both white players have been changed,
[7573.00 - 7578.00] P:2323.49 E:0.098159 |  and they've got a lot of bit more pace and more directness in those white areas.
[7578.00 - 7582.00] P:2147.48 E:0.099727 |  So Spain in possession, just inside their own half.
[7582.00 - 7585.00] P:2226.98 E:0.103205 |  Nine minutes gone already in this first period of extra time,
[7585.00 - 7589.00] P:2063.64 E:0.107772 |  as the ball over the top looking for the run of Ansou Fassi, well-won by Hakeemi,
[7589.00 - 7592.00] P:1928.71 E:0.081268 |  and cleared away by Attyatallah,
[7592.00 - 7595.00] P:1866.68 E:0.096820 |  full Morocco won't be kept in by Alzuli,
[7595.00 - 7599.00] P:1904.15 E:0.061950 |  and Spain have the throw.
[7599.00 - 7604.00] P:2007.00 E:0.089622 |  Marcus Llorente will take it back to Rodri.
[7604.00 - 7608.00] P:2237.50 E:0.099514 |  And again, Morocco just getting the red shirts back and into position,
[7608.00 - 7614.00] P:2271.29 E:0.101204 |  as La Porte has made that excellent challenge to Denier offside, Shadira,
[7614.00 - 7617.00] P:2363.01 E:0.107322 |  although it would have been tight, plays it forward,
[7617.00 - 7620.00] P:2007.06 E:0.112538 |  and now into the penalty area, goes Marata left-hand side of the box,
[7620.00 - 7624.00] P:1963.45 E:0.105578 |  pulls the ball across, excellent header away on the edge of the six-yard box,
[7624.00 - 7629.00] P:1817.42 E:0.101641 |  and Morocco will complete the clearance through Azazuli up towards halfway.
[7629.00 - 7632.00] P:1949.17 E:0.091241 |  But again, that's good movement from Spain.
[7632.00 - 7636.00] P:2096.56 E:0.108970 |  Yeah, again, and it's Marata. He's on the shoulder, he'll make the move,
[7636.00 - 7640.00] P:2224.15 E:0.104927 |  he'll ask a question, and then he'll wasn't doing that in the first half at all,
[7640.00 - 7643.00] P:2281.18 E:0.111422 |  and he just looks a much more natural striker,
[7643.00 - 7648.00] P:2291.98 E:0.114342 |  and at the moment he looks by far the most likely player to score in that field.
[7648.00 - 7652.00] P:2027.82 E:0.114719 |  Ball out to the right-hand side, lifted in, bounces almost all the way through this time,
[7652.00 - 7658.00] P:1893.60 E:0.099985 |  and the shot was driven in by Baldey, and spins out of play for a Spain throw.
[7658.00 - 7663.00] P:1881.19 E:0.108979 |  It is all Spain at the moment, and Morocco are coming under real pressure in their own penalty area.
[7663.00 - 7668.00] P:2041.83 E:0.100576 |  Baldey with the throw, takes it quickly down to Ansu Fati of Barcelona out for the corner.
[7668.00 - 7672.00] P:2000.30 E:0.096814 |  I'm being triggered here, they've got a corner kick, and previously in that spin,
[7672.00 - 7676.00] P:2054.39 E:0.097591 |  they've taken some corner kicks, taken them short, they've ended up in their own penalty vaults.
[7676.00 - 7681.00] P:2198.82 E:0.101638 |  They seem to do the same this time, Spain, they really need to get it in, they've taken a shot, however.
[7681.00 - 7685.00] P:2126.67 E:0.108647 |  However, still, because they're still playing it around, and Pedri tried to play it in,
[7685.00 - 7688.00] P:1808.63 E:0.108970 |  and they might be caught here, Spain is Morocco trying to come forward,
[7688.00 - 7691.00] P:1862.70 E:0.099820 |  it's a good club covering clearance by Baldey.
[7691.00 - 7695.00] P:1803.05 E:0.095791 |  Now to play, but again, Pat, it's just wasted.
[7695.00 - 7700.00] P:1731.17 E:0.086943 |  Yeah, there's a technical term for the way they're playing their corners, they're rubbish.
[7700.00 - 7705.00] P:1731.40 E:0.102144 |  They're just a bit rubbish, they've tried to play them short, they end up losing the ball,
[7705.00 - 7710.00] P:1850.79 E:0.093161 |  they end up in their own penalty vaults, they end up defending from their own corner kicks,
[7710.00 - 7716.00] P:1863.42 E:0.083764 |  and I know they don't believe in their ability to just put the ball in the box, but surely it's better than that.
[7716.00 - 7720.00] P:1693.18 E:0.102236 |  And to be fair, Morocco have the height of Saís, who's been so dominant in the year,
[7720.00 - 7724.00] P:1775.03 E:0.097737 |  El Yameek is the same, however, they've got Marathe in there,
[7724.00 - 7728.00] P:1822.99 E:0.105387 |  as Azuli tries to trick his way past Rodri in the penalty area,
[7728.00 - 7732.00] P:1865.38 E:0.080191 |  and ends up fouling the Manchester City man, so it's a free kick to Spain.
[7732.00 - 7738.00] P:2032.82 E:0.098013 |  But just, if you're not going to swing it in straight away, do something on the third pass.
[7738.00 - 7740.00] P:2231.65 E:0.097962 |  You actually need to do something with it.
[7740.00 - 7745.00] P:2307.93 E:0.109055 |  I mean, teams work on their set pieces all the time, a lot of goals are scored from set pieces.
[7745.00 - 7751.00] P:2329.24 E:0.107732 |  You're actually just giving away opportunities there by not at some point making sure it ends up in the box.
[7751.00 - 7757.00] P:2263.05 E:0.106136 |  So Spain in possession, just inside the Morocco half, 0-0 on five-live BBC sounds,
[7757.00 - 7762.00] P:1920.11 E:0.107061 |  and across Africa on the BBC World Services, Morocco get themselves into a real mix-up at the back there,
[7762.00 - 7765.00] P:1865.86 E:0.104310 |  cleared away by Saís, well Bono was coming for the ball over the top,
[7765.00 - 7768.00] P:1919.35 E:0.103861 |  looked all day long as though he was going to get there first,
[7768.00 - 7774.00] P:1846.27 E:0.093546 |  but the substitute centre half, Jouel El Yameek, basically charges into his own goalkeeper,
[7774.00 - 7779.00] P:1719.69 E:0.099215 |  won the header out of his own goalkeeper's hands, and was lucky that Saís was there to tidy up.
[7779.00 - 7784.00] P:1709.80 E:0.103215 |  Yep, his eyes shut as well, and that's the problem, if you do change the centre-backs,
[7784.00 - 7787.00] P:1706.08 E:0.101666 |  and when they've worked together and look brilliant, both centre-backs,
[7787.00 - 7790.00] P:1738.98 E:0.104491 |  and they work well with the keeper, they all understand each other,
[7790.00 - 7793.00] P:1700.42 E:0.104058 |  but you have to make changes sometimes because of injury,
[7793.00 - 7797.00] P:1773.46 E:0.090281 |  and they've done that and the understanding certainly wasn't there.
[7797.00 - 7803.00] P:2203.54 E:0.102712 |  Let off for Morocco, two and a half minutes to play in this first period of extra time,
[7803.00 - 7811.00] P:2304.97 E:0.099831 |  0-0 in the round of 16 with Spain, here is Pedri, plays it forward now to Rodri,
[7811.00 - 7816.00] P:2291.31 E:0.094314 |  and the half-way line will be picked up for Spain,
[7816.00 - 7821.00] P:2269.29 E:0.097031 |  and then squared back across to Imariq La Porte,
[7821.00 - 7826.00] P:2330.01 E:0.111746 |  left-hand side goes Pedri once more, and Rodri has it in the centre-circle,
[7826.00 - 7834.00] P:1925.02 E:0.091417 |  will go for goal from 40 yards, slips, it's over the bar, that's not what they need to try.
[7834.00 - 7838.00] P:1752.50 E:0.102847 |  About a real bad desperation there is no doubt that's exactly what that is,
[7838.00 - 7841.00] P:1897.53 E:0.101507 |  but you do have to remember, look players are tired now,
[7841.00 - 7845.00] P:1994.87 E:0.103116 |  they've had a lot of games, they've had a lot of football in a short period of time,
[7845.00 - 7848.00] P:1981.64 E:0.097323 |  they've seen it together, not looking on and walked up,
[7848.00 - 7851.00] P:1918.72 E:0.103174 |  where you'd actually come in to look a little bit of a rest as well.
[7851.00 - 7856.00] P:1886.03 E:0.101186 |  You can actually see that in some of the players, certainly some of the players in Sky Blue down there,
[7856.00 - 7860.00] P:1796.11 E:0.100764 |  they've been way, way below, what I'd have expected them to,
[7860.00 - 7865.00] P:1858.53 E:0.087622 |  and that all goes around the fact that that was a hell of a tired looking shot.
[7865.00 - 7871.00] P:1786.56 E:0.104777 |  It was, as Morocco come forward, nice footwork on the edge of the penalty area,
[7871.00 - 7876.00] P:1745.14 E:0.109943 |  and all the way through almost goes Shadira, and Seymour makes the save,
[7876.00 - 7881.00] P:1881.24 E:0.109160 |  that was a beautiful bit of play, set up brilliantly by Anahi, Shadira into the area,
[7881.00 - 7891.00] P:1964.38 E:0.100261 |  took the shot, Seymour makes the save, and now it opens up for Spain as Pedri tries to squeeze it in field to the waiting team-mates,
[7891.00 - 7895.00] P:1798.77 E:0.103809 |  but he won't find the light blue shirt and the ball goes out of play.
[7895.00 - 7898.00] P:1599.49 E:0.099392 |  What a chance for Morocco, and that's brilliant play.
[7898.00 - 7903.00] P:1818.77 E:0.089264 |  You know what, one will buy some distance, that's the best chance of the game.
[7903.00 - 7906.00] P:1791.38 E:0.095551 |  For either team, that is the best chance of the game.
[7906.00 - 7910.00] P:1813.38 E:0.101211 |  You just got to get it with some power either side of the goalkeeper, it's not a tough angle.
[7910.00 - 7916.00] P:1858.26 E:0.096700 |  He's gone well, he's got himself into very good position, Shadira hasn't he?
[7916.00 - 7920.00] P:1792.54 E:0.099128 |  He looks a bit awkward the way he moves, he's big, he's a bit lumbering,
[7920.00 - 7924.00] P:1883.40 E:0.095880 |  but he's got himself into a very good position so far, but he should have finished better.
[7924.00 - 7934.00] P:1946.38 E:0.098017 |  The build-up play into that was by Anahi, was magnificent, absolutely sliced through that entire defence in midfield
[7934.00 - 7937.00] P:2031.70 E:0.093750 |  of Spain and he should be ahead.
[7938.00 - 7945.00] P:2231.36 E:0.107196 |  Well, as Dean Anahi, a Spain Havages inside the centre-circle, was playing in the French third tier 18 months ago,
[7945.00 - 7951.00] P:2246.03 E:0.115311 |  made his debut in January and he's become a very important player for Morocco over the past year or so,
[7951.00 - 7956.00] P:2043.70 E:0.099109 |  Spain come down the right-hand side, cleared away well by Ramon Saïs.
[7956.00 - 7964.00] P:1969.63 E:0.089501 |  We played the 15 minutes in this first period of extra time into one minute of added time
[7964.00 - 7972.00] P:2110.19 E:0.104214 |  and Morocco will be reflecting on that chance that Shadira has just had as the ball is all the way across the penalty area
[7972.00 - 7976.00] P:1827.94 E:0.104706 |  headed out by Zee Esch for a Spain corner and this one there will be time to take.
[7976.00 - 7978.00] P:1941.16 E:0.108419 |  Now, what do we do Pat Nevin, do we go short again?
[7978.00 - 7982.00] P:2128.99 E:0.104725 |  Well, they've got about 20 seconds to take the corner kick so they'll probably play it back to the keeper.
[7982.00 - 7987.00] P:2194.13 E:0.114599 |  No, come on, they must put it in there, they must get a chance to attack it.
[7987.00 - 7991.00] P:2246.17 E:0.110004 |  They've got, you know, the ports got attacked, the Rodries got attacked.
[7991.00 - 7996.00] P:2094.20 E:0.109205 |  Sole is over this, Spain are players tumbling into each other really inside the penalty area
[7996.00 - 8002.00] P:1893.18 E:0.091287 |  and the referee has gone over, will he say that Spain will take the corner again?
[8002.00 - 8004.00] P:1807.26 E:0.073460 |  Got to, yeah, absolutely.
[8004.00 - 8008.00] P:2054.24 E:0.099992 |  Yeah, I was a little, I think even looking at the corner when it's played in so, you know,
[8008.00 - 8013.00] P:2232.63 E:0.110289 |  it was just falling over each other, that's all it was but actually it was a pure corner
[8013.00 - 8016.00] P:2248.71 E:0.119489 |  and was getting the goalkeeper's hand so he's got another chance.
[8016.00 - 8019.00] P:2217.93 E:0.111017 |  There's a poor corner and Morocco will say, well, we didn't do much wrong there.
[8019.00 - 8024.00] P:2119.44 E:0.110936 |  But they have another corner to defend and it's swung in once again by Soler and Bodo Kams,
[8024.00 - 8029.00] P:1932.70 E:0.103302 |  gets a good punch on it, it's met by Llorente, cleared away by Morocco once more,
[8029.00 - 8032.00] P:2064.39 E:0.094476 |  out of play for a Spain throw.
[8033.00 - 8040.00] P:1986.43 E:0.097903 |  And the referee just telling Spain not to take this throw just yet because Marata has stayed down
[8040.00 - 8046.00] P:1915.59 E:0.092362 |  on the edge of the six yard box and it looks as though as the referee continues to talk to Marata,
[8046.00 - 8052.00] P:1771.12 E:0.098278 |  that will be that for the first half, the players are coming over, the substitutes are wandering onto the pitch.
[8052.00 - 8057.00] P:1844.72 E:0.095786 |  And now Pat Nevin, 15 minutes of extra time to play.
[8057.00 - 8061.00] P:1671.47 E:0.091551 |  I mean, I just, I don't think we're going to see Spain do anything different and Morocco,
[8061.00 - 8065.00] P:1566.48 E:0.098993 |  I mean, why would they? Their game plan is working absolutely fine.
[8065.00 - 8071.00] P:1653.34 E:0.096180 |  You think about it, with that break that they had there, that was all about pace, break,
[8071.00 - 8077.00] P:1744.15 E:0.099296 |  you'll get the odd chance, they got the chance, they just didn't take it and they could have been sitting here
[8077.00 - 8082.00] P:1795.01 E:0.100790 |  one nil off and Spain would have been trying everything, they would have been playing short corners
[8082.00 - 8088.00] P:1760.00 E:0.088549 |  and they actually scored that goal there, they've been throwing everything at Morocco, as it is, it's still wide open.
[8088.00 - 8097.00] P:1805.12 E:0.084630 |  So half time in extra time, Kelly, Morocco nil, Spain nil, are we heading for the P word?
[8097.00 - 8104.00] P:1641.29 E:0.094124 |  It might well happen and if it does, Vicky Sparks and Pat Nevin will be across every single one of them.
[8104.00 - 8110.00] P:1784.80 E:0.088934 |  Pat, you said to Chappers earlier on that you think that this game could be decided now by the team that's fitters,
[8110.00 - 8117.00] P:1767.11 E:0.090216 |  not necessarily the team that's best. Can you look at the experience in the Spain squad compared to that in the Morocco squad?
[8117.00 - 8120.00] P:1728.67 E:0.087685 |  Does that count mentally as well as physically?
[8120.00 - 8128.00] P:1854.97 E:0.094131 |  That's a great question actually. Before this World Cup, I'd have known the answer and the answer is, you go with the experienced players,
[8128.00 - 8131.00] P:1757.62 E:0.087713 |  they know they're playing in the biggest leagues, they're ultra fit.
[8131.00 - 8138.00] P:1790.42 E:0.097212 |  There's been times during this World Cup where the less fancy teams, the teams from Africa, from North Africa, from the Middle East
[8138.00 - 8142.00] P:1881.26 E:0.080842 |  have shocked the rest of them by playing at that incredible intensity.
[8142.00 - 8145.00] P:1754.18 E:0.104076 |  The Japanese have been like that as well for various games.
[8145.00 - 8152.00] P:1855.68 E:0.097088 |  So I'm afraid Kelly, it's such a good question. I don't know the answer. We're going to find out in the next 15 minutes.
[8152.00 - 8156.00] P:1796.21 E:0.112138 |  Well, that's exactly it. Only time will tell as to what turns out to be the difference.
[8156.00 - 8162.00] P:1865.76 E:0.093940 |  But again, it could just be about one moment over the next 15 minutes or else.
[8162.00 - 8169.00] P:1812.01 E:0.092207 |  We will be heading to penalties between Morocco and Spain. With you for the rest of Extra Time, it is Pat Nevin and Vicky Sparks.
[8169.00 - 8177.00] P:1839.70 E:0.089430 |  Thanks Kelly. So Morocco preparing to get us underway at the start of this second period of Extra Time.
[8177.00 - 8184.00] P:1804.62 E:0.087772 |  It's about nerves, it's about concentration, it's about executing the game plan.
[8184.00 - 8190.00] P:1892.34 E:0.095805 |  Morocco have executed theirs to a tee and they're going for goal from kickoff. Well, there you go.
[8190.00 - 8196.00] P:1877.64 E:0.089945 |  Sales over the bar. You know, Simon was watching it, wasn't too far off his line either.
[8196.00 - 8200.00] P:1850.37 E:0.099732 |  Well, that was certainly in the script at some point, wasn't it?
[8200.00 - 8205.00] P:2218.49 E:0.103812 |  It's absolutely nothing wrong with that. You know, a keeper goes and stands in the 18-yard lane.
[8205.00 - 8211.00] P:2179.03 E:0.105241 |  If he's not paying attention just for a second and you get it on target from the kickoff, there's got a chance.
[8211.00 - 8215.00] P:1856.24 E:0.109159 |  Here comes Spain looking for Marasa through the middle, cleared away by Morocco.
[8215.00 - 8223.00] P:1982.52 E:0.099612 |  Nico Williams is jumping for it, won't reach it but it will be picked up by Soler. 25 yards out, plays it out to the left-hand side
[8223.00 - 8229.00] P:1860.55 E:0.099772 |  but Ansifati can't bring it under his spell and the ball is out of play for Morocco. Goal kick.
[8229.00 - 8234.00] P:1880.85 E:0.098758 |  Just for a moment there, the player would not mention a great deal of his amrabat.
[8234.00 - 8241.00] P:1894.58 E:0.100201 |  And I've been watching for about 70 minutes now and I'm thinking you're going to have to go off any minute now because you're wrecked.
[8241.00 - 8247.00] P:1948.73 E:0.101273 |  But he's still going and he's still going. If you look at the middle of the field there, his head's down,
[8247.00 - 8253.00] P:1803.42 E:0.096957 |  he looks as if he's just about to go on his knees. He's been lit up for the vast majority of the second half there
[8253.00 - 8259.00] P:1816.55 E:0.098205 |  and certainly he's been lit up all the way through at the time. But wow, he's put in a shot.
[8259.00 - 8265.00] P:1567.50 E:0.098766 |  Absolutely, the ball is sent out to the right-hand side by Bonnet, won't be kept in by Morocco.
[8265.00 - 8272.00] P:2092.92 E:0.100037 |  Enjoying a great season with your own Tina. Sokian Amrabat has been with Liverpool amongst others,
[8272.00 - 8279.00] P:2240.36 E:0.102476 |  but such a key man in the centre of the midfield from Morocco who are level with Spain.
[8279.00 - 8289.00] P:2172.49 E:0.101799 |  0-0, two minutes gone in this second period of extra time here on 5 Live, BVC Sounds and across Africa on the BVC World Service.
[8289.00 - 8298.00] P:2168.17 E:0.105226 |  Spain in possession, didn't get in the field. Amrabat will now close down, but Spain do work it well down the left-hand side
[8298.00 - 8303.00] P:1881.79 E:0.103753 |  as Balde will chase, very well defended by Ashraf Akimi.
[8304.00 - 8309.00] P:1870.04 E:0.101589 |  He's quality, isn't he? I mean, as a full-back, you know, we know he's got pace, we've watched him over there,
[8309.00 - 8314.00] P:1922.86 E:0.098041 |  he's got phenomenal pace. But he's reading the game, he's been fantastic as well.
[8314.00 - 8322.00] P:1952.59 E:0.099240 |  I mean, it's been one of the highlights of the game, is watching the full-backs against the Wangers for both sides,
[8322.00 - 8329.00] P:1928.62 E:0.103152 |  but none of them have actually won it yet, have they? None of the Wangers have actually won it enough to go and put the perfect ball
[8329.00 - 8337.00] P:1807.67 E:0.091089 |  and to set up a really nice piece of play. At the moment, I just want to see those full-backs getting a little bit further forward.
[8337.00 - 8340.00] P:1933.10 E:0.097839 |  And maybe he, more than anyone else, Akimi is the one who could do it.
[8340.00 - 8343.00] P:1998.81 E:0.102815 |  He launches the ball forward, Akimi looking for Zee Esch.
[8344.00 - 8348.00] P:1771.24 E:0.091659 |  We won't keep it in, and it goes out for a Spain goal kick.
[8348.00 - 8356.00] P:2093.42 E:0.102275 |  So, they can quickly buy Unise Seymon. Are we to see a little injection of urgency into this Spain side
[8356.00 - 8363.00] P:2084.52 E:0.104127 |  in this second period of extra time as some of that manages almost to steal that away from Busquets.
[8363.00 - 8368.00] P:2159.00 E:0.097989 |  It's all the way back with Unise Seymon as Spain do work it back to their goalkeeper.
[8368.00 - 8371.00] P:2162.37 E:0.105713 |  Well, he's picking and choosing his moments, isn't he, Amrabat?
[8371.00 - 8376.00] P:2204.38 E:0.102430 |  But he has given absolutely every drop of sweat out there.
[8377.00 - 8380.00] P:2177.43 E:0.111987 |  Here comes Spain, dinking the ball towards the penalty area.
[8380.00 - 8384.00] P:2021.18 E:0.092458 |  Llorente won't get there though, and Morocco will clear away.
[8385.00 - 8387.00] P:1784.52 E:0.103530 |  The miss cue though by Ezel Zuli.
[8387.00 - 8392.00] P:2111.37 E:0.095291 |  And it's a Spain throw as Luis Enrique comes right up to the edge of his technical area.
[8392.00 - 8396.00] P:2162.91 E:0.096853 |  Applauds as La Porte sends it forward.
[8396.00 - 8399.00] P:1933.93 E:0.092665 |  Ati et alas underneath it for Morocco.
[8399.00 - 8405.00] P:1922.71 E:0.097566 |  Head around and the Spain substitutes are out very quickly to try and get things moving again quickly.
[8405.00 - 8407.00] P:2260.09 E:0.104943 |  Llorente sends it back to Rodri.
[8407.00 - 8410.00] P:2233.13 E:0.111132 |  And I think there is a little bit more urgency about Spain.
[8410.00 - 8415.00] P:2233.22 E:0.116514 |  They're not changing the way they play necessarily, but in terms of the restarts, in terms of getting things moving,
[8415.00 - 8417.00] P:2218.38 E:0.110626 |  they've just upped it a bit.
[8417.00 - 8419.00] P:2260.66 E:0.121880 |  You're right, they have, they moved it.
[8419.00 - 8422.00] P:2257.24 E:0.110831 |  You asked the question, why do you not do that earlier?
[8422.00 - 8425.00] P:2373.69 E:0.120492 |  Are we able to do that earlier? Do you not think you can keep up that sharp edge?
[8425.00 - 8429.00] P:2142.18 E:0.099270 |  Or is it just the personnel that are on just now with the substitutes that they made
[8429.00 - 8431.00] P:2040.05 E:0.102027 |  want to move it that little bit quicker?
[8431.00 - 8434.00] P:2212.02 E:0.092001 |  I don't think that is the case. I think it's coming from the back.
[8434.00 - 8437.00] P:2173.57 E:0.111732 |  And here at the back for Spain is Rodri.
[8437.00 - 8439.00] P:2253.86 E:0.107336 |  Squares it to La Porte.
[8439.00 - 8443.00] P:2077.23 E:0.094427 |  Ball forward is poor, cleared away by Eliamique.
[8443.00 - 8444.00] P:1881.29 E:0.088635 |  Out of play.
[8444.00 - 8447.00] P:1672.18 E:0.092584 |  It will be a throw on the far side to Spain.
[8447.00 - 8451.00] P:2136.85 E:0.096239 |  And it's been a little bit more than four minutes gone in the second period of extra time.
[8451.00 - 8456.00] P:2297.99 E:0.109359 |  It's very, very noticeable that Marata has got himself nailed on to Elmir.
[8456.00 - 8461.00] P:2232.97 E:0.109950 |  He has made sure that he's against the defender who's most likely to turn off.
[8461.00 - 8464.00] P:2260.67 E:0.105884 |  And very, very clever play by Marata.
[8464.00 - 8468.00] P:2172.57 E:0.107784 |  Yeah, given up on getting anything out of Soiís, who's had another good game,
[8468.00 - 8470.00] P:2245.32 E:0.091405 |  the Morocco captain.
[8470.00 - 8475.00] P:1954.63 E:0.092822 |  But Eliamique, as Pat says there, has looked a little bit shaky
[8475.00 - 8479.00] P:1748.87 E:0.095852 |  coming off the bench as Spain charged the ball down just outside the penalty area.
[8479.00 - 8481.00] P:1627.99 E:0.110532 |  Morocco will clear away all that's not good.
[8481.00 - 8484.00] P:1744.39 E:0.097571 |  Saís has gone down clutch in the back of his leg.
[8484.00 - 8489.00] P:1865.56 E:0.098926 |  Or if that's a hamstring, that is terrible news for Morocco as they look to come forward.
[8489.00 - 8491.00] P:1880.90 E:0.104373 |  Shadira, they won't latch onto it.
[8491.00 - 8493.00] P:2080.73 E:0.087238 |  They have one more change.
[8493.00 - 8496.00] P:1981.08 E:0.100897 |  They can make Morocco and Saís is done.
[8496.00 - 8500.00] P:2079.85 E:0.099801 |  Saís is done and the referee stopped play here in Spain,
[8500.00 - 8503.00] P:1924.89 E:0.102808 |  and they're furious because they're saying, look, yes, he's injured,
[8503.00 - 8505.00] P:1856.19 E:0.109053 |  but it's not a serious injury.
[8505.00 - 8507.00] P:1677.38 E:0.113776 |  It's not a dangerous injury that we're worried about.
[8507.00 - 8509.00] P:1770.79 E:0.094669 |  Morocco are saying, well, come on, our captain's gone down,
[8509.00 - 8511.00] P:1864.98 E:0.100963 |  and the referee stopped play.
[8511.00 - 8513.00] P:1892.70 E:0.089430 |  Spain are in possession inside their own half.
[8513.00 - 8515.00] P:1772.16 E:0.091506 |  What's your perspective on that?
[8515.00 - 8517.00] P:1903.14 E:0.071417 |  I have no idea why he stopped the play.
[8517.00 - 8519.00] P:1810.39 E:0.108815 |  It's not a head injury.
[8519.00 - 8521.00] P:1961.62 E:0.079175 |  For head injuries, you stop the play.
[8521.00 - 8526.00] P:1809.09 E:0.091166 |  You know, it's up to the Spanish to decide are we going to be professional,
[8526.00 - 8528.00] P:1558.08 E:0.092804 |  trying to go and win the game here,
[8528.00 - 8530.00] P:1700.36 E:0.092226 |  and then go that bit of an advantage because the players get injured,
[8530.00 - 8533.00] P:1777.06 E:0.092187 |  or are we going to be, you know, doing sports and the like thing.
[8533.00 - 8535.00] P:1814.40 E:0.080881 |  It's their choice.
[8535.00 - 8536.00] P:1763.53 E:0.096315 |  I don't know if it's the referee's choice.
[8536.00 - 8537.00] P:1746.32 E:0.109096 |  There's 100 referees out there,
[8537.00 - 8539.00] P:1814.48 E:0.099060 |  because no, no, no, we make the decisions.
[8539.00 - 8542.00] P:1808.00 E:0.099376 |  But if you stop it to game, everything, someone goes down.
[8542.00 - 8544.00] P:1772.81 E:0.113106 |  You can manipulate the play that way,
[8544.00 - 8546.00] P:1688.66 E:0.104558 |  and I'm really surprised the referee stopped that.
[8546.00 - 8548.00] P:1873.77 E:0.076023 |  Really surprised.
[8548.00 - 8549.00] P:1826.79 E:0.122801 |  Well, he's trying to...
[8549.00 - 8551.00] P:1808.48 E:0.083622 |  It may just be cramp.
[8551.00 - 8552.00] P:1828.65 E:0.082403 |  Well, that's it.
[8552.00 - 8553.00] P:1800.95 E:0.100984 |  He's trying to jog.
[8553.00 - 8555.00] P:1826.06 E:0.078897 |  The stretch is gone.
[8555.00 - 8558.00] P:1743.29 E:0.098432 |  He's almost jogged over to the sidelines.
[8558.00 - 8561.00] P:1835.93 E:0.101414 |  Morocco have the substitution ready to go if needed.
[8561.00 - 8563.00] P:1985.24 E:0.075092 |  Badda Benoun.
[8563.00 - 8565.00] P:1846.50 E:0.104464 |  But Roman Saiz is receiving some treatment.
[8565.00 - 8567.00] P:1947.47 E:0.100445 |  They're strapping up that left thigh,
[8567.00 - 8569.00] P:2264.21 E:0.094508 |  so it may not be the hamstring.
[8569.00 - 8571.00] P:2280.42 E:0.115611 |  He may be able to continue,
[8571.00 - 8573.00] P:2250.23 E:0.111641 |  and Badda Benoun has gone to sit back down.
[8573.00 - 8576.00] P:2137.11 E:0.094767 |  So, Carlos Soler for Spain,
[8576.00 - 8578.00] P:2064.20 E:0.109288 |  just outside the penalty area.
[8578.00 - 8580.00] P:2077.69 E:0.105137 |  Morocco temporarily down to 10 with Saiz off the pitch,
[8580.00 - 8582.00] P:2155.87 E:0.107124 |  but he's such a huge player.
[8582.00 - 8584.00] P:2250.10 E:0.096759 |  If he can get back on, they'll be desperate
[8584.00 - 8586.00] P:2224.70 E:0.094757 |  to get him back on.
[8586.00 - 8588.00] P:2140.65 E:0.115711 |  Spain in possession.
[8588.00 - 8590.00] P:2171.31 E:0.100737 |  Play the ball out to the left-hand side.
[8590.00 - 8591.00] P:2221.71 E:0.118124 |  And he is back on Saiz.
[8591.00 - 8593.00] P:2257.37 E:0.077549 |  He's not moving freely,
[8593.00 - 8596.00] P:2151.86 E:0.107918 |  but he's back on to take his place in the defence.
[8596.00 - 8598.00] P:2043.75 E:0.107769 |  As Spain come forward once more,
[8598.00 - 8600.00] P:2028.63 E:0.107757 |  whether that's a wise decision or not,
[8600.00 - 8604.00] P:2178.02 E:0.100045 |  we will find out how freely can the Morocco captain move
[8604.00 - 8606.00] P:1887.50 E:0.114805 |  as Spain into the penalty area left-hand side,
[8606.00 - 8608.00] P:1970.41 E:0.103860 |  pull back across, cleared away by Morocco,
[8608.00 - 8610.00] P:1842.61 E:0.098828 |  and Amrabat will help it on,
[8610.00 - 8612.00] P:2012.35 E:0.086977 |  on the edge of the penalty area.
[8612.00 - 8614.00] P:2160.69 E:0.108546 |  Shadira won't latch on to it, though.
[8614.00 - 8616.00] P:2157.79 E:0.104770 |  There are some tired legs out there,
[8616.00 - 8618.00] P:2192.85 E:0.108160 |  and all eyes on Roman Saiz.
[8618.00 - 8620.00] P:2207.74 E:0.108263 |  How freely can he move?
[8620.00 - 8622.00] P:2171.78 E:0.100100 |  Because Spain, well, if they've got anything about them,
[8622.00 - 8624.00] P:2040.59 E:0.101370 |  they'll try and test him,
[8624.00 - 8626.00] P:1701.84 E:0.113231 |  but they can't keep it in.
[8626.00 - 8628.00] P:1707.05 E:0.103222 |  Nico Williams has let the ball go out of play,
[8628.00 - 8630.00] P:1850.53 E:0.091054 |  and Morocco have a throw in.
[8630.00 - 8632.00] P:1637.62 E:0.111635 |  And now, Pat, if Saiz is struggling,
[8632.00 - 8634.00] P:1786.15 E:0.096615 |  surely the aim for Morocco has to be keep it tight
[8634.00 - 8636.00] P:1809.18 E:0.108495 |  and get to penalties.
[8636.00 - 8638.00] P:1992.67 E:0.104281 |  I have to say, I am startled that he's still on that field just now,
[8638.00 - 8640.00] P:1915.60 E:0.103381 |  because the way he's dragging his leg behind him,
[8640.00 - 8642.00] P:1970.57 E:0.111837 |  it looks like a player that, if he's asked to go and chase somebody,
[8642.00 - 8644.00] P:1924.38 E:0.093254 |  he's not harming them.
[8644.00 - 8646.00] P:1934.72 E:0.108874 |  He'll ping that hamstring,
[8646.00 - 8648.00] P:1914.93 E:0.107090 |  or else he'll get cramp again, he won't be able to run.
[8648.00 - 8651.00] P:1973.64 E:0.091930 |  So this is a huge chance
[8651.00 - 8653.00] P:1750.77 E:0.080917 |  that Morocco are taking just now, if he can.
[8654.00 - 8657.00] P:1844.66 E:0.106570 |  Midway through the second period of extra time,
[8657.00 - 8660.00] P:1745.64 E:0.103461 |  they've won another throw down the left-hand side, Morocco.
[8660.00 - 8662.00] P:1767.64 E:0.081004 |  We have made five changes, though.
[8662.00 - 8666.00] P:1818.24 E:0.089026 |  They have, but they do get the extra one in added time,
[8666.00 - 8669.00] P:1735.57 E:0.102261 |  so that is the relief for Morocco
[8669.00 - 8672.00] P:1687.38 E:0.102286 |  that they get the one more change they can make.
[8672.00 - 8675.00] P:1705.43 E:0.095693 |  And it's one of those that, again,
[8675.00 - 8678.00] P:2002.15 E:0.080892 |  find margins,
[8678.00 - 8682.00] P:2260.32 E:0.101301 |  that there's the option there, should they need to use it.
[8682.00 - 8685.00] P:2315.89 E:0.108171 |  Here, Al-Spain in position.
[8685.00 - 8687.00] P:2316.29 E:0.108368 |  Midway through their own half.
[8687.00 - 8691.00] P:2324.85 E:0.104038 |  La Porte, out to the left-hand side is the option,
[8691.00 - 8693.00] P:2246.99 E:0.104999 |  but he coasted to me instead.
[8693.00 - 8695.00] P:2187.11 E:0.111364 |  Well, that's where you think, surely that's the ball,
[8695.00 - 8697.00] P:2306.33 E:0.098577 |  but he'll know only when he's in field instead.
[8697.00 - 8699.00] P:2299.98 E:0.116592 |  Do you want any of the things that's jumping out?
[8699.00 - 8701.00] P:2286.82 E:0.114114 |  I mean, just know, I mean, there's very, very tension in that stadium.
[8701.00 - 8704.00] P:2298.59 E:0.111069 |  Obviously, the Moroccans are really uptight about it.
[8704.00 - 8706.00] P:2311.01 E:0.101354 |  They would love to get to penalty kicks.
[8706.00 - 8708.00] P:2180.61 E:0.110545 |  Do you know why? Behind both goals.
[8708.00 - 8711.00] P:1987.55 E:0.093592 |  Yeah, completely in abundance.
[8711.00 - 8714.00] P:2044.05 E:0.106713 |  There's so many of those Moroccan fans behind the goal.
[8714.00 - 8716.00] P:2056.97 E:0.113141 |  Here comes Spains, he eschies down,
[8716.00 - 8718.00] P:2003.16 E:0.112635 |  Play continues, Amrabat gets the fit in.
[8718.00 - 8720.00] P:1895.68 E:0.102102 |  Oh, brilliant skill from Amrabat.
[8720.00 - 8722.00] P:1873.90 E:0.101167 |  Fantastic to win it, to keep it,
[8722.00 - 8725.00] P:1787.75 E:0.109563 |  and to have the composure to set Morocco away.
[8725.00 - 8728.00] P:1767.65 E:0.112445 |  Here is Shadira, driving towards the penalty area.
[8728.00 - 8730.00] P:1741.42 E:0.113645 |  Shadira into the box, can he find room for the shot?
[8730.00 - 8732.00] P:1559.67 E:0.114693 |  He ran out of legs, he ran out of room.
[8732.00 - 8734.00] P:1769.27 E:0.101833 |  He ran into Oonaie Simon.
[8734.00 - 8736.00] P:1900.70 E:0.099430 |  Do you know what?
[8736.00 - 8738.00] P:1815.45 E:0.108591 |  He is a loveable character, the way he won.
[8738.00 - 8741.00] P:1941.59 E:0.102815 |  He just looks so lumbering, but he keeps on going,
[8741.00 - 8744.00] P:1933.42 E:0.103732 |  he keeps on chasing, he does run out of gas at the end there
[8744.00 - 8747.00] P:1922.10 E:0.101152 |  and runs out of legs, even though he's just come on,
[8747.00 - 8750.00] P:2078.52 E:0.109708 |  his substitute, but he's given Rodger in La Porte
[8750.00 - 8752.00] P:2139.13 E:0.100633 |  something to think about.
[8752.00 - 8754.00] P:2161.20 E:0.104470 |  They have to watch out for everything,
[8754.00 - 8756.00] P:2166.59 E:0.109824 |  they're taking those runs.
[8756.00 - 8759.00] P:2201.50 E:0.091920 |  He's had two opportunities now, and still no gosh, are we?
[8759.00 - 8762.00] P:2110.01 E:0.102609 |  Five and a half minutes plus added time to play.
[8762.00 - 8764.00] P:2042.39 E:0.111231 |  Good interception by Hakimi,
[8764.00 - 8766.00] P:1859.39 E:0.101165 |  although Pedri has gone down and stayed down,
[8766.00 - 8769.00] P:1877.85 E:0.104288 |  and Morocco will come forward with Nahi,
[8769.00 - 8772.00] P:1907.69 E:0.099850 |  forward once more, Hakimi.
[8772.00 - 8774.00] P:2061.78 E:0.111258 |  No free kick.
[8774.00 - 8777.00] P:1996.70 E:0.114566 |  The referee say no, you just ran into your opponent there.
[8777.00 - 8780.00] P:2162.63 E:0.116948 |  And the referee's decided to be players down there,
[8780.00 - 8782.00] P:2213.63 E:0.111019 |  he's been allowed to play on this time.
[8782.00 - 8785.00] P:2159.30 E:0.120120 |  You know, it just seems to change all the time, that rule.
[8785.00 - 8788.00] P:2184.02 E:0.110181 |  Into the final five minutes,
[8788.00 - 8791.00] P:2134.53 E:0.121323 |  0-0 between Morocco and Spain in extra time,
[8791.00 - 8794.00] P:2134.43 E:0.107930 |  ball out to the right-hand side, Nico Williams will chase,
[8794.00 - 8796.00] P:1817.47 E:0.108838 |  Ati at Alam will get there.
[8796.00 - 8798.00] P:1795.75 E:0.113699 |  That's been a good battle, it's gone down to play
[8798.00 - 8801.00] P:1949.78 E:0.082666 |  for a Morocco goal kick, and you have to say,
[8801.00 - 8803.00] P:1743.14 E:0.109193 |  Ati at Alam has been very good since coming on.
[8803.00 - 8805.00] P:1862.83 E:0.099458 |  Fabulous, still was there in my mouth.
[8805.00 - 8807.00] P:1826.44 E:0.117512 |  I mean, he's up against Nico Worms, he's come on,
[8807.00 - 8810.00] P:1846.97 E:0.109662 |  and he left the game up when he came on.
[8810.00 - 8813.00] P:1895.15 E:0.114961 |  However, Ati Alam comes on himself to you, I thought,
[8813.00 - 8815.00] P:1917.68 E:0.101302 |  well, they've got a problem there.
[8815.00 - 8817.00] P:1842.63 E:0.123338 |  Well, apparently not, he's lightning-quick,
[8817.00 - 8820.00] P:1895.95 E:0.096462 |  playing at scale, and totally fearless.
[8820.00 - 8823.00] P:1893.14 E:0.111334 |  Well, he's a player that manager Walid Ragraghi knows
[8823.00 - 8827.00] P:1613.61 E:0.099062 |  very well indeed part of the side, under Ragraghi,
[8827.00 - 8830.00] P:1655.50 E:0.109066 |  that won the African Champions League last season.
[8830.00 - 8833.00] P:1674.21 E:0.093905 |  Oh, I'd add Casablanca, the Moroccan champions.
[8833.00 - 8837.00] P:1634.15 E:0.108142 |  He's given several of those players a chance in this Morocco squad.
[8837.00 - 8840.00] P:1734.70 E:0.096462 |  And he's come on, the 27-year-old,
[8840.00 - 8843.00] P:1698.66 E:0.097449 |  and acquitted himself very well so far.
[8843.00 - 8846.00] P:1890.95 E:0.099889 |  Four minutes of added of extra time to play,
[8846.00 - 8848.00] P:1795.86 E:0.087996 |  then we'll be into added time.
[8848.00 - 8851.00] P:1857.50 E:0.084829 |  Nil-nil as Morocco pick-up possession,
[8851.00 - 8855.00] P:1889.26 E:0.093600 |  and suddenly Morocco are starting to stream forward.
[8855.00 - 8858.00] P:1756.56 E:0.109110 |  Ati at Alam, and there's Azuli just get themselves
[8858.00 - 8861.00] P:1853.88 E:0.111180 |  into a bit of a tangle there, and that might open it up,
[8861.00 - 8863.00] P:2022.46 E:0.105494 |  because suddenly that left-back position is vacated,
[8863.00 - 8865.00] P:2016.16 E:0.121227 |  and Nico Williams plays it in field to Marata.
[8865.00 - 8868.00] P:2031.30 E:0.109878 |  Marata bearing down on the Morocco goal still going.
[8868.00 - 8871.00] P:1917.44 E:0.110909 |  Marata, terrible ball through.
[8871.00 - 8873.00] P:1818.23 E:0.096994 |  Chance wasted for Spain.
[8873.00 - 8876.00] P:1872.49 E:0.095085 |  He was trying to play an Anzu Fassi,
[8876.00 - 8878.00] P:1666.00 E:0.110097 |  and it was a shocker of a pass.
[8878.00 - 8880.00] P:1893.37 E:0.093602 |  It was a great break for Spain.
[8880.00 - 8882.00] P:1613.63 E:0.109612 |  They had four players up there.
[8882.00 - 8884.00] P:1969.07 E:0.085516 |  Marata was one of them, didn't shoot, tried to feed Fassi,
[8884.00 - 8886.00] P:1910.74 E:0.112660 |  and it's behind.
[8886.00 - 8888.00] P:1893.17 E:0.107893 |  Do you know in that situation, last night with Brazil,
[8888.00 - 8891.00] P:1974.24 E:0.100544 |  they scored every single time,
[8891.00 - 8893.00] P:1805.96 E:0.120714 |  but the Spanish weren't able to do that.
[8893.00 - 8895.00] P:1749.98 E:0.097155 |  It was a shame though, because the misunderstanding
[8895.00 - 8898.00] P:1776.66 E:0.116023 |  with Ati Alam and the youngster Azuli,
[8898.00 - 8899.00] P:1730.00 E:0.116581 |  they came on.
[8899.00 - 8901.00] P:1856.16 E:0.115842 |  I mean, it was quite amateurish,
[8901.00 - 8903.00] P:1861.18 E:0.119381 |  that misunderstanding, the way it can say,
[8903.00 - 8905.00] P:1754.77 E:0.118678 |  and that was the biggest chance I would see
[8905.00 - 8907.00] P:1722.59 E:0.119952 |  Spain had to score, and they weren't able
[8907.00 - 8909.00] P:1853.50 E:0.117688 |  to even get shot on target.
[8909.00 - 8911.00] P:1727.27 E:0.114813 |  Bono clears over the halfway line.
[8911.00 - 8913.00] P:1608.40 E:0.107334 |  The Spain substitutes around in the technical area,
[8913.00 - 8915.00] P:1785.11 E:0.098519 |  saying, look, he's time-wasting.
[8915.00 - 8918.00] P:1999.17 E:0.105354 |  That shows that Spain really want to push on and win this.
[8918.00 - 8920.00] P:1986.66 E:0.113418 |  Morocco might settle for penalties,
[8920.00 - 8922.00] P:2033.84 E:0.104346 |  as Nico Williams, did he keep that in?
[8922.00 - 8925.00] P:1886.59 E:0.105434 |  Play continues for now, and the corner's been given,
[8925.00 - 8927.00] P:1766.46 E:0.112724 |  and Morocco are saying, that went out of play.
[8927.00 - 8930.00] P:1843.41 E:0.088589 |  The assistant is saying, no, he didn't.
[8930.00 - 8932.00] P:1820.52 E:0.116593 |  Yeah, nothing you can really do about that,
[8932.00 - 8934.00] P:2015.24 E:0.092004 |  because it's not going to go...
[8934.00 - 8936.00] P:1964.88 E:0.084380 |  Is it going to go to the...
[8936.00 - 8937.00] P:1840.22 E:0.107652 |  Is Jesus Mane?
[8937.00 - 8939.00] P:1966.69 E:0.075090 |  That's staggering.
[8939.00 - 8940.00] P:1858.32 E:0.100664 |  That is weird.
[8940.00 - 8942.00] P:1794.26 E:0.095351 |  No, it is definitely Jesus Mane.
[8942.00 - 8944.00] P:1840.58 E:0.096089 |  Looks like it's going to go to the goal kick,
[8944.00 - 8945.00] P:1989.62 E:0.064587 |  and he believes it's gone out.
[8945.00 - 8949.00] P:1727.45 E:0.091255 |  So change being made for Spain,
[8949.00 - 8951.00] P:1774.79 E:0.112989 |  Pablo Sarabia is coming on.
[8952.00 - 8955.00] P:1598.80 E:0.106753 |  And the substitute is being substituted.
[8955.00 - 8957.00] P:1687.65 E:0.110580 |  Nico Williams is off now.
[8957.00 - 8959.00] P:1682.00 E:0.090609 |  We're moments away from penalties.
[8959.00 - 8960.00] P:1807.76 E:0.112022 |  That's got to be it.
[8960.00 - 8962.00] P:1634.16 E:0.100491 |  Williams hasn't done anything wrong.
[8962.00 - 8964.00] P:1752.24 E:0.098328 |  That's not his fault there,
[8964.00 - 8967.00] P:1753.81 E:0.091797 |  and you just want somebody who's confident with a penalty kick.
[8969.00 - 8971.00] P:1763.65 E:0.099188 |  You wouldn't be surprised if you've gotten
[8971.00 - 8975.00] P:1773.44 E:0.095623 |  some sort of attitude from the Moroccans here.
[8975.00 - 8976.00] P:1864.13 E:0.102565 |  They're taking the time here.
[8976.00 - 8977.00] P:1882.71 E:0.099319 |  Who are they going to take off?
[8977.00 - 8979.00] P:1953.12 E:0.081439 |  They seem to have... No, they've changed their mind.
[8979.00 - 8981.00] P:1861.45 E:0.091389 |  They were actually going to make a decision there with...
[8981.00 - 8983.00] P:1828.27 E:0.081846 |  So that's it.
[8983.00 - 8985.00] P:1705.12 E:0.089055 |  That's the question, isn't it?
[8987.00 - 8989.00] P:1958.95 E:0.091473 |  If you take the nahi off now,
[8989.00 - 8992.00] P:1975.17 E:0.091112 |  and Sainz can't last these last few minutes,
[8992.00 - 8994.00] P:2012.57 E:0.101736 |  they probably want to make a change,
[8994.00 - 8996.00] P:1878.97 E:0.096598 |  but they want to make it the seconds to go.
[8996.00 - 8998.00] P:1865.71 E:0.094223 |  Yeah, will they get the chance?
[8998.00 - 9000.00] P:1955.80 E:0.064809 |  That's the question.
[9000.00 - 9003.00] P:1895.05 E:0.105721 |  Paul has gone out of play for a spain throw.
[9003.00 - 9007.00] P:1935.22 E:0.098090 |  90 seconds of extra time, plus added time to play.
[9007.00 - 9010.00] P:2053.98 E:0.098232 |  It's goalless. It's Spain in possession.
[9010.00 - 9012.00] P:2136.75 E:0.107230 |  On five live BBC sounds,
[9012.00 - 9015.00] P:2194.15 E:0.112596 |  and a cross Africa on the BBC World Service.
[9015.00 - 9017.00] P:2233.72 E:0.114770 |  Here is Rodri on the halfway line.
[9017.00 - 9020.00] P:2278.92 E:0.115807 |  The Morocco fans inside this stadium once again,
[9020.00 - 9022.00] P:2211.91 E:0.120122 |  cheering and whistling,
[9022.00 - 9026.00] P:2199.94 E:0.106912 |  trying to see their team up to the line for penalties.
[9026.00 - 9028.00] P:2015.22 E:0.107080 |  And then we'll see who crosses it.
[9028.00 - 9032.00] P:1904.93 E:0.086526 |  But Llorente's done well. He's won the corner for Spain.
[9032.00 - 9034.00] P:1945.11 E:0.091489 |  Well, it was really tense.
[9034.00 - 9035.00] P:1903.51 E:0.097426 |  Look at the intensity of Spain.
[9035.00 - 9036.00] P:1923.50 E:0.095022 |  Much, much better now.
[9036.00 - 9038.00] P:1903.85 E:0.106793 |  They're going to make that change,
[9038.00 - 9041.00] P:1961.66 E:0.095718 |  and it is going to be a nahi who actually comes off.
[9041.00 - 9042.00] P:2072.91 E:0.100003 |  He's played really well.
[9042.00 - 9044.00] P:1973.50 E:0.095701 |  He's a lovely player to watch.
[9044.00 - 9046.00] P:1938.19 E:0.102092 |  He's got a silky scale,
[9046.00 - 9048.00] P:1938.38 E:0.105697 |  but he kind of cruises over the ground,
[9048.00 - 9051.00] P:2001.94 E:0.085705 |  and he's a player I would watch him every week.
[9051.00 - 9054.00] P:1989.80 E:0.099244 |  And on comes Badr Benu,
[9054.00 - 9057.00] P:1968.76 E:0.076863 |  who plays his club football in Qatar.
[9057.00 - 9059.00] P:1911.91 E:0.103388 |  His World Cup debut,
[9059.00 - 9061.00] P:1896.25 E:0.114648 |  he was actually named in the squad,
[9061.00 - 9064.00] P:1899.21 E:0.101625 |  the Provisional Squad of 23 for 2018,
[9064.00 - 9067.00] P:2020.87 E:0.102186 |  and then a late change was made tactically,
[9067.00 - 9070.00] P:2064.62 E:0.103456 |  and then the Serie got the place instead.
[9070.00 - 9072.00] P:1975.59 E:0.115355 |  The Spain, swing the corner in,
[9072.00 - 9075.00] P:2014.68 E:0.091076 |  is cleared away by Morocco,
[9075.00 - 9078.00] P:2140.88 E:0.099511 |  played forwards by Spain once more,
[9078.00 - 9080.00] P:2183.98 E:0.101316 |  out to the left-hand side.
[9080.00 - 9083.00] P:2182.23 E:0.110610 |  As we approach out of time at the end of extra time,
[9083.00 - 9085.00] P:1908.43 E:0.114193 |  and the ball is stolen by Morocco,
[9085.00 - 9086.00] P:1917.31 E:0.092843 |  they'll look to counter,
[9086.00 - 9088.00] P:1873.09 E:0.108361 |  but Spain should be there.
[9088.00 - 9091.00] P:1933.97 E:0.099271 |  Busquets is, and Tidey's all the way back to Uniceman.
[9091.00 - 9094.00] P:2077.06 E:0.095454 |  Three minutes of added time.
[9094.00 - 9096.00] P:2121.72 E:0.115289 |  What about the pace now, Spain?
[9096.00 - 9099.00] P:2147.38 E:0.109111 |  They're playing the way you thought they should have played.
[9099.00 - 9100.00] P:2058.30 E:0.125770 |  And now they're going?
[9100.00 - 9102.00] P:2196.39 E:0.115117 |  Maybe even more than that.
[9102.00 - 9103.00] P:2218.02 E:0.104041 |  They're trying to lift it,
[9103.00 - 9105.00] P:2260.40 E:0.103059 |  they're trying to ask different questions.
[9105.00 - 9107.00] P:2240.33 E:0.123064 |  It seems so late to do it.
[9107.00 - 9109.00] P:2295.69 E:0.116837 |  Hey, if you're going to score a goal in the last three minutes,
[9109.00 - 9110.00] P:2252.16 E:0.107909 |  it's the right thing to do,
[9110.00 - 9112.00] P:2278.41 E:0.113752 |  but it was one chance to take.
[9112.00 - 9114.00] P:2244.68 E:0.108545 |  You have a capable of doing quicker.
[9114.00 - 9117.00] P:2207.99 E:0.112456 |  Ball is out to the left-hand side once more for Spain,
[9117.00 - 9120.00] P:2201.80 E:0.103060 |  into three minutes of added time
[9120.00 - 9124.00] P:2194.75 E:0.112311 |  on five-life BBC sounds and across Africa on the World Service.
[9124.00 - 9125.00] P:2142.66 E:0.110601 |  Out to the right-hand side,
[9125.00 - 9128.00] P:2136.69 E:0.113038 |  and Llorente plays it in field.
[9128.00 - 9129.00] P:2040.70 E:0.107474 |  Sarabia, the substitute.
[9129.00 - 9131.00] P:2021.66 E:0.109558 |  Little bit of space on the edge of the box,
[9131.00 - 9133.00] P:1926.56 E:0.105375 |  but Busquets well blocked away by Saïs,
[9133.00 - 9136.00] P:1967.93 E:0.097160 |  who is still shouldering on.
[9136.00 - 9139.00] P:1952.73 E:0.102873 |  And the ball is cleared over halfway by Morocco,
[9139.00 - 9142.00] P:2076.86 E:0.096803 |  and we have two minutes for someone to find a goal
[9142.00 - 9143.00] P:1900.06 E:0.112454 |  or its penalties.
[9143.00 - 9144.00] P:2144.84 E:0.095167 |  Do you know what?
[9144.00 - 9146.00] P:2179.23 E:0.101083 |  Both sides has to take a penalty kick.
[9146.00 - 9148.00] P:2210.23 E:0.110443 |  You know, it almost can't run.
[9150.00 - 9154.00] P:2170.20 E:0.110086 |  Ball is out to the left-hand side for Spain once more.
[9154.00 - 9156.00] P:2232.01 E:0.111024 |  You wonder if that's why they're trying to keep him on
[9156.00 - 9159.00] P:2223.15 E:0.101518 |  as much as anything else.
[9159.00 - 9162.00] P:2204.34 E:0.111538 |  Spain in position with Busquets,
[9162.00 - 9164.00] P:2180.52 E:0.112307 |  central position out to the right-hand side.
[9164.00 - 9167.00] P:2225.43 E:0.107143 |  Sarabia, left-footed delivery into the area.
[9167.00 - 9170.00] P:1824.95 E:0.107102 |  The header flicked in and just cleared away
[9170.00 - 9173.00] P:1864.12 E:0.095729 |  inside his own six-yard box by El Yameek,
[9173.00 - 9176.00] P:1883.33 E:0.103279 |  and it's one of those parts that from our angle,
[9176.00 - 9179.00] P:1950.37 E:0.087191 |  we could not see where that was going.
[9179.00 - 9181.00] P:2015.00 E:0.115719 |  Could have been an on-goal, and honestly,
[9181.00 - 9183.00] P:2124.20 E:0.108336 |  see if it would have been had if given up in football.
[9183.00 - 9187.00] P:2212.86 E:0.109231 |  That would be heartbreaking and grossly unfair.
[9187.00 - 9190.00] P:2150.84 E:0.108136 |  So, corner from this right-hand side for Spain.
[9190.00 - 9193.00] P:2242.89 E:0.104045 |  We're approaching the final minute of added time
[9193.00 - 9196.00] P:2212.47 E:0.091996 |  at the ends of extra time.
[9196.00 - 9200.00] P:2185.58 E:0.104071 |  A Spain goal now surely breaks Moroccan hearts.
[9200.00 - 9202.00] P:2189.52 E:0.101649 |  They have the corner from the right.
[9202.00 - 9205.00] P:2061.83 E:0.094745 |  It's headed away powerfully by Shadira
[9205.00 - 9208.00] P:2186.12 E:0.100432 |  on the edge of his own six-yard box.
[9208.00 - 9211.00] P:2256.00 E:0.106781 |  Ball is back with Spain.
[9211.00 - 9213.00] P:2215.49 E:0.110582 |  Pedri wants it on this right-hand side
[9213.00 - 9216.00] P:2245.03 E:0.116144 |  and gets it now, midway through the Morocco half.
[9216.00 - 9218.00] P:2233.38 E:0.114448 |  We're into the final minute of added time
[9218.00 - 9220.00] P:2126.72 E:0.094119 |  as Busquets picks it up.
[9220.00 - 9224.00] P:2160.43 E:0.107928 |  Outside the penalty area, Spain looking to work the opportunity.
[9224.00 - 9226.00] P:2133.90 E:0.112201 |  Busquets out to the left-hand side.
[9226.00 - 9228.00] P:2003.99 E:0.105546 |  Ball is swung in right-footed,
[9228.00 - 9231.00] P:1728.24 E:0.117314 |  and Sarabia at the far post, all the way across goal
[9231.00 - 9233.00] P:1791.03 E:0.096925 |  on the tightest of angles,
[9233.00 - 9235.00] P:1810.39 E:0.105066 |  and the Spain substitutes are on the pitch,
[9235.00 - 9238.00] P:1792.31 E:0.104385 |  and they drift and melt back into that technical area
[9238.00 - 9241.00] P:1935.09 E:0.095844 |  because that was a huge chance for the winner
[9241.00 - 9243.00] P:1758.67 E:0.106489 |  to send them through to the quarterfinals.
[9243.00 - 9247.00] P:1826.66 E:0.102540 |  Yes, I grant you that it was a difficult angle,
[9247.00 - 9249.00] P:1909.59 E:0.098010 |  but there's a chance for Gordy.
[9249.00 - 9251.00] P:1877.56 E:0.112207 |  I think they might have even had the post.
[9251.00 - 9254.00] P:1940.20 E:0.096150 |  He's falling to put such an acute angle.
[9254.00 - 9257.00] P:1917.04 E:0.109582 |  And in many ways, that's actually a hard to have a take-off.
[9257.00 - 9259.00] P:1880.53 E:0.117900 |  Because keep us coming out, he's not at the angle.
[9259.00 - 9262.00] P:1973.46 E:0.094476 |  He's actually had the back post there.
[9262.00 - 9265.00] P:1950.81 E:0.099081 |  Oh, that's incredible course.
[9265.00 - 9267.00] P:1883.56 E:0.114501 |  Why weren't Spain playing like this before?
[9267.00 - 9268.00] P:1962.32 E:0.101304 |  Too late now.
[9268.00 - 9270.00] P:1885.24 E:0.114948 |  The width of the woodwork away,
[9270.00 - 9274.00] P:1974.81 E:0.094287 |  but it's not enough for Sarabia and Spain,
[9274.00 - 9276.00] P:1909.32 E:0.111207 |  and we are heading to penalties
[9276.00 - 9278.00] P:1924.27 E:0.107934 |  for the second time at this World Cup.
[9278.00 - 9281.00] P:1887.79 E:0.099846 |  Croatia prevailed against Japan,
[9281.00 - 9284.00] P:1866.93 E:0.089773 |  who will prevail out of Morocco and Spain.
[9284.00 - 9287.00] P:1741.84 E:0.105901 |  It finishes at the end of extra time.
[9287.00 - 9290.00] P:1706.48 E:0.088151 |  Morocco nil, Spain nil.
[9290.00 - 9292.00] P:1782.01 E:0.105199 |  Vicky and Pat will give you a couple of minutes
[9292.00 - 9295.00] P:1719.29 E:0.097844 |  to draw up your penalty grids on the back of your notes
[9295.00 - 9297.00] P:1694.72 E:0.086215 |  ahead of the penalty shootout at that game
[9297.00 - 9299.00] P:1573.66 E:0.111136 |  between Morocco and Spain.
[9299.00 - 9301.00] P:1704.28 E:0.105361 |  Guillem Balegay is also with us.
[9301.00 - 9304.00] P:1811.46 E:0.093095 |  Guillem Pat asked the question right at the end of commentary there.
[9304.00 - 9307.00] P:1721.82 E:0.093400 |  Why haven't Spain played like that earlier in the game?
[9307.00 - 9308.00] P:1544.05 E:0.090843 |  What's your answer?
[9308.00 - 9312.00] P:1594.24 E:0.090899 |  We are playing against a team that didn't want to play.
[9312.00 - 9314.00] P:1657.30 E:0.099244 |  It was still like that, and by the way,
[9314.00 - 9316.00] P:1577.13 E:0.076322 |  great choice of a way of defending.
[9316.00 - 9319.00] P:1725.61 E:0.089700 |  They were very alert, they didn't make any mistakes.
[9319.00 - 9321.00] P:1709.23 E:0.079673 |  That Morocco did were very good.
[9321.00 - 9325.00] P:1641.44 E:0.064475 |  They could have done better with the last decision
[9325.00 - 9327.00] P:1387.23 E:0.081542 |  when they attacked, but in terms of defending,
[9327.00 - 9329.00] P:1730.40 E:0.075900 |  they stopped us, they blocked us.
[9329.00 - 9332.00] P:1683.95 E:0.091671 |  We couldn't have a single space in the first hour,
[9332.00 - 9334.00] P:1513.40 E:0.074756 |  and then we went for a single move,
[9334.00 - 9337.00] P:1554.56 E:0.079575 |  especially attacking with Nico Williams.
[9337.00 - 9339.00] P:1617.50 E:0.069234 |  That didn't happen fully either,
[9339.00 - 9342.00] P:1615.15 E:0.079487 |  and we needed Ounei Simon to actually make sure
[9342.00 - 9346.00] P:1771.24 E:0.091921 |  that we didn't concede in the first half of the extra time.
[9346.00 - 9351.00] P:1547.20 E:0.080433 |  So it wasn't just us, it was the way that we were forced to play.
[9351.00 - 9354.00] P:1571.24 E:0.079475 |  But at the end, there is tiredness,
[9354.00 - 9357.00] P:1708.49 E:0.081886 |  there are players that want to play that shouldn't be on the pitch,
[9357.00 - 9360.00] P:1555.08 E:0.080573 |  as I think the centre-back of Morocco wasn't ready to continue,
[9360.00 - 9363.00] P:1875.58 E:0.081803 |  but in any case, the chances came.
[9363.00 - 9366.00] P:1660.86 E:0.097156 |  It was almost an on-goal of Al-Yamik and Salabiya,
[9366.00 - 9368.00] P:1712.72 E:0.070933 |  hit the post, the far post,
[9368.00 - 9371.00] P:1694.98 E:0.073038 |  and now it's all done to a lottery.
[9372.00 - 9375.00] P:1660.52 E:0.088310 |  Guillem Balagay, it is going to penalties.
[9375.00 - 9378.00] P:1666.13 E:0.099745 |  Education City between Morocco and Spain
[9378.00 - 9381.00] P:1684.52 E:0.095762 |  will be back there very shortly as the players
[9381.00 - 9383.00] P:1835.85 E:0.090189 |  are huddled around their managers,
[9383.00 - 9387.00] P:1755.96 E:0.090478 |  getting last-minute preparations ahead of that penalty shootout.
[9387.00 - 9391.00] P:1655.07 E:0.094850 |  The next game is a 7 o'clock kick-off at the Lusail Stadium.
[9391.00 - 9394.00] P:1728.98 E:0.090259 |  It's between Portugal and Switzerland.
[9394.00 - 9398.00] P:1720.98 E:0.093103 |  Your commentary team will be Rob Green and Alistair Bruce Ball and Ali.
[9398.00 - 9401.00] P:1900.32 E:0.078559 |  Big team news coming out of that one.
[9401.00 - 9404.00] P:1890.14 E:0.085808 |  Definitely. On a team news front, this is fairly seismic.
[9404.00 - 9407.00] P:1880.03 E:0.089900 |  Cristiano Ronaldo playing his fifth,
[9407.00 - 9410.00] P:1779.54 E:0.086114 |  and potentially, we're pretty sure on, his final World Cup,
[9410.00 - 9414.00] P:1838.38 E:0.079359 |  he's not starting for Portugal in this last 16 game.
[9414.00 - 9418.00] P:1859.06 E:0.086727 |  Now, that is a big call from Fernando Santos, of course.
[9418.00 - 9420.00] P:1924.61 E:0.095031 |  He has started the first three games.
[9420.00 - 9423.00] P:1857.13 E:0.091057 |  There's lots of Portuguese fans back home who I think will agree with the decision.
[9423.00 - 9426.00] P:1919.52 E:0.087703 |  We all know there was a poll in the newspaper back there,
[9426.00 - 9431.00] P:1821.62 E:0.081864 |  70% were saying they would agree if Fernando Santos did that.
[9431.00 - 9434.00] P:1816.76 E:0.083241 |  He's done it if Portugal do go out of the World Cup tonight,
[9434.00 - 9436.00] P:1862.45 E:0.071359 |  and he's not starting Ronaldo, which he isn't.
[9436.00 - 9438.00] P:1757.26 E:0.079798 |  Then clearly, his neck is on the line.
[9438.00 - 9441.00] P:1851.80 E:0.090022 |  The one thing I would say just before you go into a penalty shootout
[9441.00 - 9443.00] P:1725.96 E:0.080662 |  in that game, Spain, Morocco,
[9443.00 - 9445.00] P:1954.76 E:0.087082 |  if Cristiano Ronaldo started the game, Kelly,
[9445.00 - 9448.00] P:1850.92 E:0.080984 |  it's very unlikely he'd play 120 minutes and finish it.
[9448.00 - 9451.00] P:1849.26 E:0.079684 |  The one thing it does allow Fernando Santos to do is,
[9451.00 - 9454.00] P:1917.04 E:0.084625 |  if it gets tied, what a substitute to bring off the bench,
[9454.00 - 9458.00] P:1820.57 E:0.077299 |  and what a man, obviously, to have involved in a penalty shootout
[9458.00 - 9460.00] P:1846.24 E:0.085855 |  if this game goes all the way later on.
[9460.00 - 9463.00] P:1946.07 E:0.084944 |  But I can't think of the last game in a major tournament
[9463.00 - 9467.00] P:1782.05 E:0.073728 |  when Cristiano Ronaldo was fit that he didn't start for Portugal.
[9467.00 - 9468.00] P:1789.05 E:0.081838 |  But that is the news.
[9468.00 - 9472.00] P:1821.73 E:0.085972 |  21-year-old Benfica striker, Gonzalo Ramos,
[9472.00 - 9474.00] P:1738.44 E:0.078949 |  is starting up front for Portugal.
[9474.00 - 9476.00] P:1766.55 E:0.075538 |  Ronaldo does not start this game.
[9476.00 - 9477.00] P:1570.77 E:0.062457 |  Thank you, Ellie.
[9477.00 - 9480.00] P:1669.89 E:0.096878 |  And as Ellie said, what a substitute to be able to bring on.
[9480.00 - 9483.00] P:1903.06 E:0.094146 |  Should it be tied late on, and there are tired legs
[9483.00 - 9484.00] P:1658.33 E:0.082835 |  in that Switzerland defence.
[9484.00 - 9487.00] P:1679.95 E:0.094390 |  They will not look forward to seeing Cristiano Ronaldo on the pitch,
[9487.00 - 9489.00] P:1731.84 E:0.078543 |  but he doesn't start for Portugal.
[9489.00 - 9491.00] P:1579.97 E:0.087271 |  We'll be back there for the rest of the team news,
[9491.00 - 9494.00] P:1760.74 E:0.087329 |  and to build up to that 7 o'clock kickoff
[9494.00 - 9497.00] P:1819.18 E:0.091420 |  at the Lisei Stadium between Portugal and Switzerland.
[9497.00 - 9501.00] P:1785.59 E:0.101308 |  Meanwhile, last-minute preparations underway for a penalty shootout
[9501.00 - 9504.00] P:1879.84 E:0.103616 |  as the captain's head over to talk to the referee,
[9504.00 - 9507.00] P:1906.21 E:0.097224 |  Morocco taking on Spain at Education City.
[9507.00 - 9511.00] P:1972.95 E:0.089039 |  It was nil-nil after 120 minutes.
[9511.00 - 9513.00] P:1904.41 E:0.098768 |  Pat and Vicky are still there.
[9513.00 - 9517.00] P:1839.48 E:0.086392 |  Pat, this is a situation that Spain could have avoided.
[9517.00 - 9520.00] P:1801.95 E:0.093009 |  There were enough opportunities for them in this match.
[9520.00 - 9525.00] P:1869.98 E:0.077099 |  They just really struggled to get that final finish on the ball.
[9525.00 - 9529.00] P:1819.35 E:0.087279 |  Yeah, just a wee bit disappointed with them, actually,
[9529.00 - 9532.00] P:1749.01 E:0.108376 |  because the increase in tempo, as the game went on,
[9532.00 - 9534.00] P:1836.52 E:0.106866 |  I think they've done that earlier.
[9534.00 - 9536.00] P:1831.04 E:0.112327 |  I don't think Morocco would be able to stand with it.
[9536.00 - 9538.00] P:1890.53 E:0.093128 |  So if you're going to try and one-wall cups,
[9538.00 - 9540.00] P:1733.33 E:0.099196 |  you have to be, maybe, still a bit braver
[9540.00 - 9544.00] P:1726.54 E:0.105094 |  to be able to do that and take a chance with your energy levels
[9544.00 - 9546.00] P:1659.62 E:0.093174 |  to start a wee bit quicker than they did.
[9546.00 - 9548.00] P:1775.23 E:0.093349 |  However, they didn't.
[9548.00 - 9552.00] P:1829.29 E:0.101061 |  And as we speak, is that Hacking Zee, actually, I think?
[9552.00 - 9554.00] P:1858.01 E:0.107622 |  I'll try to see if it is. No, maybe not.
[9554.00 - 9556.00] P:1768.67 E:0.107793 |  Anyway, first penalty kick in a minute, Kelly.
[9556.00 - 9558.00] P:1810.57 E:0.093389 |  We're nearly there.
[9558.00 - 9560.00] P:1781.51 E:0.104537 |  Well, we're slightly behind you in terms of the pictures
[9560.00 - 9562.00] P:1793.82 E:0.104675 |  in the studio compared to at the stadium.
[9562.00 - 9566.00] P:1817.24 E:0.098530 |  So I can see Eunice Simon making his way to the goal,
[9566.00 - 9569.00] P:1847.45 E:0.082283 |  and the penalty shootout is about to get underway.
[9569.00 - 9572.00] P:1892.12 E:0.078652 |  Pat Nevin is there, and Vicky Sparks.
[9572.00 - 9574.00] P:1956.22 E:0.077534 |  Thanks, Kelly.
[9574.00 - 9577.00] P:1589.60 E:0.108195 |  So the first penalty will be taken by Morocco.
[9577.00 - 9583.00] P:1772.97 E:0.078990 |  It will be taken by Abdulhamid Sabiri off the bench,
[9583.00 - 9585.00] P:1689.47 E:0.099084 |  up against Eunice Simon,
[9585.00 - 9588.00] P:1833.92 E:0.094711 |  who with Bono is just getting his final instructions from the referee.
[9588.00 - 9592.00] P:1721.54 E:0.105329 |  Eunice Simon, who saved three penalties at Euro 2020
[9592.00 - 9594.00] P:1728.77 E:0.101361 |  in penalty shootouts for Spain,
[9594.00 - 9597.00] P:1689.32 E:0.104331 |  two against Switzerland in the quarterfinal, which they won,
[9597.00 - 9600.00] P:1856.72 E:0.090363 |  won against Italy in the semi-final, which they lost.
[9600.00 - 9603.00] P:1720.64 E:0.100200 |  And of course, Spain have been here before.
[9603.00 - 9606.00] P:1617.20 E:0.094603 |  They lost in the last 16 on penalties to Russia
[9606.00 - 9608.00] P:1466.94 E:0.097107 |  at the last World Cup.
[9608.00 - 9610.00] P:1700.84 E:0.104370 |  Pat Nevin, as Luis Enrique says,
[9610.00 - 9614.00] P:1637.80 E:0.107075 |  this is a moment of maximum tension, a time to show your nerve,
[9614.00 - 9617.00] P:1876.91 E:0.103944 |  and that you can shoot the penalty in the way you've decided
[9617.00 - 9620.00] P:1827.33 E:0.096367 |  if you have trained it a thousand times.
[9620.00 - 9622.00] P:1701.56 E:0.101858 |  That's what he told his Spain players to do.
[9622.00 - 9625.00] P:1765.49 E:0.105754 |  He wanted them to repractice to 1,000 penalties in the last year.
[9625.00 - 9628.00] P:1839.72 E:0.078965 |  How will they fare with that practice?
[9628.00 - 9631.00] P:1874.15 E:0.092937 |  How will Sabiri fare here?
[9631.00 - 9634.00] P:1825.79 E:0.085578 |  He's had to wait too long. That's unfair.
[9634.00 - 9636.00] P:1837.45 E:0.108134 |  He's taking the first penalty for Morocco,
[9636.00 - 9638.00] P:1901.16 E:0.088372 |  up against Eunice Simon.
[9638.00 - 9641.00] P:1805.22 E:0.118154 |  It's Sabiri, and he sends Simon the wrong way,
[9641.00 - 9645.00] P:1875.47 E:0.107004 |  and Morocco score the first penalty of the shootout.
[9645.00 - 9648.00] P:1909.28 E:0.113797 |  We're happy for him because in this World Cup,
[9648.00 - 9653.00] P:2001.98 E:0.110481 |  the referees have taken an eternity talking to the goalkeepers beforehand.
[9653.00 - 9656.00] P:2074.71 E:0.116934 |  The first player up stands there on the penalty spot,
[9656.00 - 9658.00] P:2080.68 E:0.113169 |  suffering that pressure.
[9658.00 - 9661.00] P:2122.31 E:0.121528 |  That makes that 10-times as good a penalty as it was before.
[9661.00 - 9663.00] P:2141.85 E:0.115963 |  Well done, Sabiri.
[9663.00 - 9667.00] P:2146.37 E:0.108228 |  So now, for Spain, it's Pablo Ciarabia,
[9667.00 - 9671.00] P:2184.04 E:0.102346 |  who hits the outside of the far post
[9671.00 - 9674.00] P:2133.65 E:0.112681 |  in the dying seconds of extra time.
[9674.00 - 9678.00] P:2134.23 E:0.103767 |  Another substitute off the bench, up against Borno,
[9678.00 - 9681.00] P:2172.70 E:0.107734 |  the Morocco number one.
[9681.00 - 9685.00] P:2093.81 E:0.102495 |  Ciarabia to take Spain's first penalty
[9685.00 - 9690.00] P:2138.05 E:0.109186 |  to draw the shootout level in the early stages at 1-1.
[9690.00 - 9693.00] P:2078.08 E:0.103679 |  It's Ciarabia, and he's hit the post!
[9693.00 - 9697.00] P:1910.27 E:0.112444 |  He's hit the post again, just as he did in the match.
[9697.00 - 9700.00] P:1921.50 E:0.107395 |  But this time, how costly could it be for Spain?
[9700.00 - 9702.00] P:1803.94 E:0.111978 |  Advantage Morocco.
[9702.00 - 9705.00] P:1758.40 E:0.121112 |  You cannot believe the noise in this place.
[9705.00 - 9707.00] P:1903.92 E:0.100853 |  It's ear-busting.
[9707.00 - 9710.00] P:1766.15 E:0.115556 |  It took a long time to make up his mind there.
[9710.00 - 9713.00] P:1806.39 E:0.112277 |  He goes right away. That's probably put him off.
[9713.00 - 9715.00] P:1771.94 E:0.111652 |  That's not going to be retaken again.
[9715.00 - 9717.00] P:1871.98 E:0.110679 |  Had it been Justin, say, the post,
[9717.00 - 9719.00] P:1755.38 E:0.119095 |  I think they'd keep him there.
[9719.00 - 9722.00] P:1981.00 E:0.092442 |  I've saved it. He was already over there waiting for it.
[9722.00 - 9726.00] P:1596.75 E:0.097394 |  Ciarabia is consoled by his teammates.
[9726.00 - 9731.00] P:1675.88 E:0.100004 |  And it's Morocco's main man, Chelsea's Hakim Ziesh.
[9731.00 - 9734.00] P:1613.05 E:0.107073 |  A few months ago, he might not even have been here,
[9734.00 - 9736.00] P:1817.74 E:0.107181 |  but under the new manager,
[9736.00 - 9738.00] P:1796.10 E:0.085967 |  he's reconciled with the national side.
[9738.00 - 9742.00] P:1817.02 E:0.093923 |  And Ziesh, with the chance to get Morocco a 2-0 advantage.
[9742.00 - 9744.00] P:1934.39 E:0.108035 |  It's Ziesh! It's fantastic!
[9744.00 - 9746.00] P:1947.79 E:0.110938 |  It's powerful! It's down the middle!
[9746.00 - 9750.00] P:1879.69 E:0.115192 |  Morocco lead by two penalties to Nile in the shootout.
[9750.00 - 9752.00] P:1916.74 E:0.104907 |  Spain have taken one less.
[9752.00 - 9755.00] P:1892.99 E:0.110800 |  You know, seven personalities are made for that sort of situation.
[9755.00 - 9758.00] P:1974.32 E:0.115515 |  He's one of them. You know, he's got the sweetest left foot.
[9758.00 - 9761.00] P:2008.13 E:0.119870 |  He has just leathered that down the middle.
[9761.00 - 9765.00] P:2101.87 E:0.120617 |  People who've gone away probably have still gone in.
[9765.00 - 9769.00] P:2124.16 E:0.118487 |  What a great opportunity that's for the Moroccans
[9769.00 - 9774.00] P:2138.26 E:0.114782 |  and what pressure, though, on every single Spanish penalty taker.
[9774.00 - 9779.00] P:2097.18 E:0.108242 |  So, Carlos Soler places the ball on the spot.
[9779.00 - 9781.00] P:2094.78 E:0.121365 |  Bono, all in the dark, purple kit,
[9781.00 - 9786.00] P:2138.06 E:0.105120 |  is told to get back on his line by the referee.
[9786.00 - 9789.00] P:2119.36 E:0.104684 |  If Soler misses this,
[9789.00 - 9792.00] P:2166.43 E:0.116472 |  Morocco will lead 2-0 in this penalty shootout,
[9792.00 - 9794.00] P:2066.39 E:0.115099 |  with two penalties apiece.
[9794.00 - 9798.00] P:2000.70 E:0.109480 |  It's Soler! It's saved by Bono!
[9798.00 - 9801.00] P:2065.17 E:0.118337 |  Remarkable!
[9804.00 - 9806.00] P:1860.02 E:0.124986 |  If I should just dive to the left,
[9806.00 - 9808.00] P:1684.36 E:0.121241 |  that every scene he's seen is going to have a lot of look at it.
[9808.00 - 9810.00] P:1825.89 E:0.119301 |  I wonder if they keep us moved.
[9810.00 - 9812.00] P:1828.02 E:0.116223 |  We've got another look at it here.
[9812.00 - 9814.00] P:1821.94 E:0.111501 |  I think he's all right now.
[9814.00 - 9816.00] P:1918.08 E:0.103136 |  I think that's going to stand.
[9816.00 - 9818.00] P:1888.91 E:0.115597 |  Nape man for the Spanish.
[9818.00 - 9820.00] P:1845.00 E:0.109765 |  Absolute nape man for the Spanish.
[9820.00 - 9823.00] P:1885.22 E:0.112250 |  There's so much pressure on every penalty if there's no,
[9823.00 - 9827.00] P:1862.91 E:0.105533 |  and so much less pressure on the Moroccans.
[9827.00 - 9829.00] P:1806.24 E:0.105013 |  Wow, what a chance they've gone out.
[9829.00 - 9833.00] P:1712.34 E:0.102309 |  And what a moment this is for Bade Benu,
[9833.00 - 9837.00] P:1757.65 E:0.105467 |  named in the Provisional Squad of 23, four years ago,
[9837.00 - 9841.00] P:1809.74 E:0.095467 |  then left out for tactical reasons, nothing else,
[9841.00 - 9846.00] P:1835.33 E:0.094482 |  off the bench, late on in extra time, to take this penalty.
[9846.00 - 9850.00] P:1897.37 E:0.100820 |  It's Benu, and it's saved by Simon.
[9850.00 - 9853.00] P:1836.81 E:0.102824 |  It was a poor penalty, and hope for Spain.
[9853.00 - 9856.00] P:1953.09 E:0.083607 |  Morocco slip up, Spain back in it.
[9856.00 - 9858.00] P:1766.63 E:0.111699 |  Oh, that was a terrible one there.
[9858.00 - 9861.00] P:1984.71 E:0.095226 |  You almost seemed to scuff the ball.
[9861.00 - 9863.00] P:1938.38 E:0.114476 |  I think it might have even hit his left foot,
[9863.00 - 9866.00] P:2090.55 E:0.104027 |  and his right foot when he's taken it.
[9866.00 - 9869.00] P:2095.66 E:0.109563 |  Terrible penalty, very easy one for the goalkeeper.
[9869.00 - 9871.00] P:2135.11 E:0.110718 |  But his teammates are up beside him saying,
[9871.00 - 9875.00] P:2120.39 E:0.105944 |  come on, we're still here, we're still in this.
[9875.00 - 9879.00] P:2099.74 E:0.103581 |  And this man knows what it takes to win a World Cup.
[9879.00 - 9881.00] P:2064.63 E:0.113553 |  This man knows what it takes to perform
[9881.00 - 9885.00] P:2116.84 E:0.107393 |  on the biggest stage of all, Sergio Biscuits for Spain.
[9885.00 - 9888.00] P:2124.06 E:0.110084 |  Morocco lead by two penalties to Nile.
[9888.00 - 9891.00] P:2140.93 E:0.110028 |  They'll have taken three each after this.
[9891.00 - 9895.00] P:2125.17 E:0.106545 |  Can Biscuits get Spain on the board?
[9895.00 - 9898.00] P:2203.32 E:0.101242 |  Bono waits on his line.
[9898.00 - 9901.00] P:2151.93 E:0.102278 |  It's Biscuits, it's a central run-up,
[9901.00 - 9904.00] P:2021.91 E:0.105969 |  and it's saved by Bono.
[9904.00 - 9909.00] P:1911.69 E:0.109302 |  Spain have missed all three of their penalties,
[9909.00 - 9914.00] P:1846.21 E:0.107397 |  and a man of that experience, you didn't see that coming,
[9914.00 - 9918.00] P:1830.59 E:0.105996 |  but that's what pressure can do, no matter the caps,
[9918.00 - 9923.00] P:1876.41 E:0.107444 |  no matter the years, and Morocco are a penalty away
[9923.00 - 9928.00] P:1918.27 E:0.098038 |  from the first World Cup quarter-final in their history.
[9928.00 - 9930.00] P:1957.39 E:0.104219 |  There's absolutely astonishing,
[9930.00 - 9933.00] P:1817.54 E:0.105920 |  they've been put up in the kicks, there's no doubt about that,
[9933.00 - 9935.00] P:1707.74 E:0.119749 |  but they keep us ready to everyone,
[9935.00 - 9938.00] P:1765.01 E:0.114991 |  and he's gone the right way three times in a row.
[9938.00 - 9942.00] P:1870.60 E:0.105052 |  So you're right, not only has he got this one kick
[9942.00 - 9945.00] P:1862.05 E:0.099152 |  to get him through, there's probably a couple more after,
[9945.00 - 9950.00] P:1868.04 E:0.104283 |  if they need it, but wow, what a situation by any footballer.
[9950.00 - 9954.00] P:1962.23 E:0.100877 |  Ashraf Hakimi, born in Madrid,
[9954.00 - 9960.00] P:1767.73 E:0.097844 |  his parents from Morocco places the ball on the spot.
[9960.00 - 9965.00] P:1775.01 E:0.093022 |  He has the chance to send Spain out of the World Cup,
[9965.00 - 9970.00] P:1903.39 E:0.105982 |  and Morocco through, it's Hakimi, it's brilliant,
[9970.00 - 9975.00] P:1888.12 E:0.111550 |  it's deep down the middle, and it's history from Morocco
[9975.00 - 9978.00] P:1886.68 E:0.114762 |  through to the World Cup quarter-finals
[9978.00 - 9981.00] P:1754.44 E:0.112443 |  for the first time in their history,
[9981.00 - 9985.00] P:1816.30 E:0.109875 |  and Spain might have practised a thousand penalties
[9985.00 - 9989.00] P:1795.36 E:0.109741 |  before this tournament, but it doesn't avail them,
[9989.00 - 9994.00] P:1780.66 E:0.110998 |  they miss every single one, Bono the hero, Hakimi the hero,
[9994.00 - 9998.00] P:1827.48 E:0.107604 |  Morocco the heroes, they're through to the quarter-finals.
[9998.00 - 10000.00] P:1790.34 E:0.119703 |  And I can't argue that they don't deserve it,
[10000.00 - 10003.00] P:1709.84 E:0.116462 |  they've been brought away, they've walked through this tournament,
[10003.00 - 10006.00] P:1581.37 E:0.116088 |  they've had to defend it, some of it's been ugly defending,
[10006.00 - 10008.00] P:1627.73 E:0.117321 |  but it's been intelligent defending it as well,
[10008.00 - 10011.00] P:1652.56 E:0.112329 |  but there'll be scouts as well in top of that,
[10011.00 - 10014.00] P:1741.14 E:0.111610 |  but the heart, the fight, the spirit they're showing,
[10014.00 - 10017.00] P:1673.98 E:0.106657 |  but also the guts during those penalty kicks,
[10017.00 - 10019.00] P:1607.58 E:0.129606 |  I've heard a lot of noises in this World Cup,
[10019.00 - 10024.00] P:1833.03 E:0.106890 |  I've not heard one like that one, it's about a billion years off,
[10024.00 - 10028.00] P:1833.73 E:0.109166 |  and what a moment, what an historic moment,
[10028.00 - 10031.00] P:1761.45 E:0.118709 |  not just for Morocco, but for African football as well.
[10031.00 - 10033.00] P:1745.24 E:0.108648 |  For African football, that's really, really big,
[10033.00 - 10037.00] P:1822.24 E:0.113486 |  but for Morocco themselves, brilliant play,
[10037.00 - 10040.00] P:1769.79 E:0.120967 |  and Spain, I don't ever want to win this competition,
[10040.00 - 10043.00] P:1799.18 E:0.112363 |  but they don't actually deserve to be any further than this,
[10043.00 - 10045.00] P:1828.84 E:0.118080 |  just with the lack of effort they put in,
[10045.00 - 10047.00] P:1822.95 E:0.111455 |  there'll be a lot of talk about in Spain
[10047.00 - 10049.00] P:1792.14 E:0.111547 |  and what it means for the future,
[10049.00 - 10051.00] P:1922.37 E:0.099503 |  but Morocco, they couldn't care less.
[10051.00 - 10058.00] P:1849.40 E:0.102284 |  The jubilation, the sheer elation inside this stadium is remarkable,
[10058.00 - 10061.00] P:1800.85 E:0.103242 |  it is packed with Morocco fans,
[10061.00 - 10064.00] P:1853.23 E:0.098003 |  they have just seen their side make history,
[10064.00 - 10067.00] P:1801.17 E:0.105326 |  he said their manager, Walid Rehgaragi,
[10067.00 - 10072.00] P:1729.03 E:0.110504 |  this was the most important day in Morocco's footballing history,
[10072.00 - 10075.00] P:1932.18 E:0.103559 |  and they've made history, Pat.
[10075.00 - 10078.00] P:1716.52 E:0.113460 |  No, they've made history, they're still celebrating,
[10078.00 - 10082.00] P:1599.36 E:0.104583 |  the keeper, I've got to say it, Bono,
[10082.00 - 10086.00] P:1635.50 E:0.112449 |  what a beautiful day for that guy, it's absolutely perfect for him,
[10086.00 - 10089.00] P:1780.49 E:0.112518 |  he's getting thrown up down, the manager,
[10089.00 - 10091.00] P:1645.32 E:0.106797 |  he's celebrating as well just now.
[10091.00 - 10094.00] P:1724.52 E:0.110707 |  Behind the goals, we talked about it during the game,
[10094.00 - 10097.00] P:1783.19 E:0.109404 |  if it goes to penalty kicks, this is a home match,
[10097.00 - 10101.00] P:1882.48 E:0.110847 |  it doesn't matter what end, it's been when the toss,
[10101.00 - 10103.00] P:1920.78 E:0.106065 |  it doesn't matter what end the pitch,
[10103.00 - 10108.00] P:1872.48 E:0.109962 |  they're going to be taking penalty kicks into a sea
[10108.00 - 10111.00] P:1800.52 E:0.109370 |  of constantly moving Moroccan fans,
[10111.00 - 10113.00] P:1809.51 E:0.110427 |  constantly screaming Moroccan fans,
[10113.00 - 10116.00] P:1797.65 E:0.112748 |  they wouldn't take the penalties into the green trousers guy,
[10116.00 - 10118.00] P:1814.05 E:0.112604 |  who is going as well there,
[10118.00 - 10121.00] P:1767.85 E:0.112562 |  which is the wrong decision once again by the Spanish,
[10121.00 - 10125.00] P:1733.52 E:0.111245 |  what a moment, what incredible scenes we're seeing here.
[10125.00 - 10128.00] P:1759.04 E:0.106337 |  Do you know what, I didn't clock whether he watched them,
[10128.00 - 10131.00] P:1650.98 E:0.107276 |  or whether he was still whipping up the crowd as he's been doing,
[10131.00 - 10135.00] P:1749.93 E:0.108696 |  but I think he'd be forgiven for having a cheeky look over his shoulder,
[10135.00 - 10137.00] P:1755.44 E:0.103201 |  and you mentioned what a moment this is for Morocco,
[10137.00 - 10141.00] P:1835.94 E:0.102109 |  Pat, but absolutely a moment for African football as well,
[10141.00 - 10145.00] P:1785.48 E:0.109595 |  Morocco are the fourth African side to reach the World Cup quarter finals,
[10145.00 - 10149.00] P:1787.51 E:0.104856 |  that's after Cameroon, Senegal and Ghana,
[10149.00 - 10154.00] P:1742.83 E:0.109311 |  and we knew they'd have the support here in Qatar as well as an Arab nation,
[10154.00 - 10157.00] P:1777.90 E:0.094955 |  but what they have done here,
[10157.00 - 10159.00] P:1791.81 E:0.110121 |  while Idrik Raghi, let's just reiterate this again,
[10159.00 - 10162.00] P:1772.45 E:0.108005 |  he took over at the end of August,
[10162.00 - 10165.00] P:1807.58 E:0.104798 |  I mean this is absolutely remarkable,
[10165.00 - 10169.00] P:1819.02 E:0.101743 |  he managed to get Hakim Zeyesh back into the fold after he'd fallen out
[10169.00 - 10171.00] P:1776.55 E:0.099807 |  with the previous manager,
[10171.00 - 10174.00] P:1710.67 E:0.105841 |  and he brought players back in, Masrawi as well,
[10174.00 - 10178.00] P:1744.86 E:0.108242 |  and now he's in the middle of the players, he's been thrown into the air,
[10178.00 - 10180.00] P:1737.10 E:0.109414 |  and unfortunately they've dropped him,
[10180.00 - 10183.00] P:1711.83 E:0.110452 |  but it's a good job that Bono had better hands in the penalty shootout
[10183.00 - 10185.00] P:1677.64 E:0.116315 |  than the rest of the Morocco players did there,
[10185.00 - 10187.00] P:1720.52 E:0.109100 |  but I don't think he'll mind a bit Raghri.
[10187.00 - 10190.00] P:1683.62 E:0.116631 |  No, you're the only one who's got a chance to see that moment,
[10190.00 - 10193.00] P:1759.15 E:0.110241 |  the camera was up above him, and he was being thrown up,
[10193.00 - 10196.00] P:1955.87 E:0.101173 |  the look on his face was a face of madness,
[10196.00 - 10199.00] P:1804.00 E:0.107919 |  he has completely and utterly lost it down there,
[10199.00 - 10203.00] P:1784.81 E:0.100938 |  and rightly so, I'm looking at all the fans, the Morocco fans,
[10203.00 - 10208.00] P:1796.58 E:0.103917 |  behind the goals there, what they're doing is they're celebrating with the players just now,
[10208.00 - 10210.00] P:1840.47 E:0.112311 |  they've not even gone up the other end now,
[10210.00 - 10212.00] P:1785.82 E:0.098482 |  there's a whole bunch of fans, when I say bunch of fans,
[10212.00 - 10214.00] P:1806.42 E:0.112249 |  there's a whole end of fans up the other end,
[10214.00 - 10218.00] P:1800.97 E:0.107111 |  who are going to have the same celebration with them in a couple of minutes when they get there,
[10218.00 - 10224.00] P:1825.36 E:0.110640 |  it really is extraordinary, you can see, you can feel how much it means to this nation.
[10224.00 - 10228.00] P:1740.50 E:0.103821 |  And we've talked a lot in this tournament part about what Spain could or couldn't do,
[10228.00 - 10233.00] P:1608.95 E:0.110207 |  and of course they've been focused on them from being semi-finalists at the Euros last year,
[10233.00 - 10239.00] P:1714.87 E:0.100059 |  forget Spain, they're out now, that's done, how far can this Morocco side go?
[10239.00 - 10242.00] P:1812.39 E:0.107321 |  No one thought they'd have gotten this far,
[10242.00 - 10248.00] P:1741.45 E:0.104809 |  so in a way, there's a downside, it's the actual World Cup final this,
[10248.00 - 10252.00] P:1816.87 E:0.104768 |  and because it's a World Cup final, can they do that sort of thing again?
[10253.00 - 10256.00] P:1740.94 E:0.108484 |  Do you know, I don't want to put a rain in your parade,
[10256.00 - 10261.00] P:1777.25 E:0.103992 |  but I would be suspecting this might be the last win in the competition this season,
[10261.00 - 10265.00] P:1833.99 E:0.101021 |  they know it's so hot, they've done plenty, they're getting this far.
[10265.00 - 10268.00] P:1537.31 E:0.109964 |  Well they've started the celebrations in earnest now,
[10268.00 - 10272.00] P:1675.61 E:0.101569 |  they've done it with their manager, they've done it with their own teammates,
[10272.00 - 10275.00] P:1671.53 E:0.107675 |  and now they go up to warnings of the Morocco fans,
[10275.00 - 10279.00] P:1648.14 E:0.106426 |  as Pat says, they'll have to make their way all the way down the other end of the pitch
[10279.00 - 10283.00] P:1550.14 E:0.109495 |  to the other Morocco end which is waiting patiently, I don't think they'll mind a job.
[10283.00 - 10287.00] P:1710.26 E:0.107826 |  I think it could be a while, Kelly, before these Morocco players leave the pitch
[10287.00 - 10291.00] P:1783.16 E:0.108599 |  because they have achieved what no side from Morocco has done before,
[10291.00 - 10294.00] P:1881.54 E:0.107436 |  only their second time in the last 16 anyway,
[10294.00 - 10298.00] P:1721.44 E:0.101268 |  their first time in the knockout stages for 36 years,
[10298.00 - 10303.00] P:1799.82 E:0.102781 |  and now they write a new chapter in the history of the Atlas Lions,
[10303.00 - 10306.00] P:1702.48 E:0.107078 |  they are through to the quarter-finals of the World Cup
[10306.00 - 10310.00] P:1612.77 E:0.090250 |  for the very first time at the expense of Spain.
[10310.00 - 10313.00] P:1669.73 E:0.114845 |  Vicky, this has been a World Cup of tears,
[10313.00 - 10319.00] P:1684.27 E:0.102292 |  for Spain, Alvaro Morato is sobbing at the final whistle and led off the pitch,
[10319.00 - 10322.00] P:1782.64 E:0.104624 |  but from Morocco in the stands and from the players,
[10322.00 - 10327.00] P:1771.83 E:0.105325 |  there are tears of joy as they celebrate their progress to the quarter-finals,
[10327.00 - 10331.00] P:1569.06 E:0.104644 |  where they will play either Portugal or Switzerland,
[10331.00 - 10333.00] P:1590.20 E:0.106857 |  that game kicks off at 7 o'clock,
[10333.00 - 10339.00] P:1663.74 E:0.106473 |  and at the end of that, Morocco will know who they will face in the quarter-finals of this World Cup.
[10339.00 - 10342.00] P:1596.61 E:0.114206 |  Luis Enrique shrugging his shoulders, he looks philosophical,
[10342.00 - 10345.00] P:1522.32 E:0.103692 |  he knows that Spain had their opportunity,
[10345.00 - 10350.00] P:1523.55 E:0.109301 |  that this is a young Spain side who will be able to go again in four years' time,
[10350.00 - 10355.00] P:1641.28 E:0.109870 |  maybe even in two years' time at the European Championships in Germany,
[10355.00 - 10358.00] P:1581.53 E:0.105988 |  but from Morocco this is a peak achievement,
[10358.00 - 10362.00] P:1606.73 E:0.109862 |  and who knows what lies ahead for them in this competition.
[10362.00 - 10365.00] P:1656.71 E:0.108679 |  They've been a fantastic tournament for them already,
[10365.00 - 10369.00] P:1556.53 E:0.106698 |  and they stay on the pitch and they celebrate with those Morocco fans,
[10369.00 - 10371.00] P:1680.09 E:0.106402 |  and we can hear what it means.
[10371.00 - 10375.00] P:1507.02 E:0.114751 |  There are so many Morocco fans, not just inside the stadium,
[10375.00 - 10380.00] P:1691.04 E:0.108116 |  but across Doha, and even as they spill out and start to spill out at the stadium,
[10380.00 - 10385.00] P:1625.30 E:0.109434 |  at Education City, we will see the scenes of celebration throughout Doha
[10385.00 - 10391.00] P:1568.86 E:0.109817 |  from those Morocco fans who you'd imagine are going to be celebrating right into the night,
[10391.00 - 10396.00] P:1566.36 E:0.108693 |  here in Qatar as they progress to the quarter-finals of the World Cup.
[10396.00 - 10400.00] P:1620.59 E:0.106888 |  We're also joined by Mahir Mazahi, a North African football journalist.
[10400.00 - 10407.00] P:1581.91 E:0.114902 |  Mahir, we're seeing and hearing how much this means to Moroccans inside Doha.
[10407.00 - 10412.00] P:1577.98 E:0.103585 |  How much does it mean to Morocco for the national team to get this far in the competition?
[10412.00 - 10416.00] P:1453.54 E:0.101754 |  When you've been following this team over the last few years,
[10416.00 - 10419.00] P:1424.90 E:0.083088 |  there are so many great little storylines that make you the wider public
[10419.00 - 10422.00] P:1484.32 E:0.091996 |  and things like, in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations,
[10422.00 - 10425.00] P:1417.91 E:0.093350 |  the last time there was a real significant penalty shootout,
[10425.00 - 10428.00] P:1612.75 E:0.085946 |  Morocco crashes out to the African Union's Berlin,
[10428.00 - 10431.00] P:1675.32 E:0.085969 |  and right before that, Haqouz-Zesh has a chance to pick a match away
[10431.00 - 10434.00] P:1516.59 E:0.094319 |  and score a penalty himself and he misses,
[10434.00 - 10438.00] P:1365.14 E:0.088320 |  and that really sets like a really complicated episode with him and the Moroccan national team
[10438.00 - 10440.00] P:1502.09 E:0.071184 |  for a long period of time.
[10440.00 - 10443.00] P:1518.91 E:0.071262 |  Vetter Benin, the third country taker for Morocco tonight,
[10443.00 - 10448.00] P:1446.40 E:0.089309 |  he was out practically all of 2022 because he had suffered heart regions after a COVID-19 infection.
[10448.00 - 10450.00] P:1353.22 E:0.092045 |  Now he's making appearance at the World Cup,
[10450.00 - 10452.00] P:1451.90 E:0.090974 |  so you really start thinking about all of these storylines combining.
[10452.00 - 10455.00] P:1346.01 E:0.086797 |  That's why it's so emotional for all the players and the fans.
[10455.00 - 10461.00] P:1699.21 E:0.095105 |  We're seeing how many Morocco fans have made it over to Doha to support their team.
[10461.00 - 10466.00] P:1687.32 E:0.096370 |  They were behind both goals, they were spread out across the whole stadium,
[10466.00 - 10470.00] P:1601.92 E:0.094062 |  but inside the country, obviously there are going to be celebrations.
[10470.00 - 10477.00] P:1670.43 E:0.100027 |  And does it... I mean, Vicky was asking Pat there about how far they can go in the tournament for tonight,
[10477.00 - 10480.00] P:1680.02 E:0.093144 |  although it's a football question that is valid to ask,
[10480.00 - 10484.00] P:1635.64 E:0.098364 |  but people celebrating this win, does it matter in this moment?
[10484.00 - 10486.00] P:1477.28 E:0.105315 |  They won't care, right now they won't care.
[10486.00 - 10491.00] P:1441.32 E:0.098753 |  And you've asked about Morocco, I mean schools have been letting children out one hour early to watch the matches
[10491.00 - 10494.00] P:1471.48 E:0.095893 |  and tie their factories, cities like Mohamediyah have shut down
[10494.00 - 10498.00] P:1321.83 E:0.099142 |  because simply two-thirds of their employees have called in sick on matchdays.
[10498.00 - 10502.00] P:1510.35 E:0.096548 |  The country literally shuts down when this team is playing it,
[10502.00 - 10506.00] P:1582.75 E:0.094720 |  and right now they won't care about whether it's Portugal or Switzerland that they're playing next.
[10506.00 - 10511.00] P:1463.21 E:0.095972 |  Right now they're just rebelling in all of this emotion and all of this joy that you see.
[10511.00 - 10518.00] P:1345.40 E:0.095829 |  And one final thing, we've seen, you know, it's been going viral when Ashraf Khakimi, for example, goes and runs and kisses his mother.
[10518.00 - 10523.00] P:1314.64 E:0.103410 |  But one thing that the Moroccan Federation has done a really good job of is sort of latching onto these intangibles,
[10523.00 - 10525.00] P:1297.94 E:0.105572 |  things like emotion and love.
[10525.00 - 10529.00] P:1394.45 E:0.093282 |  And what they've done is they've paid for every single player to have their parents at this World Cup.
[10529.00 - 10534.00] P:1379.34 E:0.093308 |  So what you might be seeing on the pitch is a lot of these players head over to this pitch side,
[10534.00 - 10539.00] P:1402.14 E:0.093541 |  go to the family box and hug their mothers because they actually really, truly believe at the Federation
[10539.00 - 10542.00] P:1398.77 E:0.090425 |  that that could be conducive to success on the pitch as well.
[10542.00 - 10546.00] P:1635.20 E:0.098049 |  Yeah, and part of that huge Morocco contingent here in Doha.
[10546.00 - 10550.00] P:1689.53 E:0.104596 |  And I don't know if you can hear them in the streets behind me here in the studio,
[10550.00 - 10557.00] P:1710.87 E:0.096176 |  even hear the car horns being honked along all the streets as Morocco fans start to celebrate.
[10557.00 - 10562.00] P:1547.13 E:0.100529 |  And there's people who aren't even Moroccan who will start to celebrate because they love a tournament upset,
[10562.00 - 10568.00] P:1669.88 E:0.094673 |  but you talk about that emotion and the fact that they have the support of their families here in Doha.
[10568.00 - 10573.00] P:1613.64 E:0.100782 |  And that's the kind of thing that, as you say, the kind of intangible that needs to be honed,
[10573.00 - 10578.00] P:1604.26 E:0.100286 |  particularly in the latter stages of a game when legs start to get tired, when emotion starts to take over,
[10578.00 - 10581.00] P:1666.26 E:0.094774 |  and nerves kick in in a penalty shootout.
[10581.00 - 10585.00] P:1641.28 E:0.089735 |  And that's where maybe they had the advantage over Spain.
[10585.00 - 10589.00] P:1446.51 E:0.088226 |  Absolutely. I think that's probably one of the most important points that we can make this tournament.
[10589.00 - 10594.00] P:1374.18 E:0.094315 |  Look, on paper, I don't think there's any doubt that Spain are probably a more talented side than Morocco.
[10594.00 - 10598.00] P:1544.16 E:0.091313 |  So where do you get the advantage if you're an underdog? It has to be with the intangibles.
[10598.00 - 10600.00] P:1526.34 E:0.094053 |  It has to be with things like motivation, home field advantage.
[10600.00 - 10606.00] P:1410.22 E:0.098986 |  I read a study from 2003 from Northumbria University that says that when players feel like they're playing at home,
[10606.00 - 10608.00] P:1570.23 E:0.093129 |  there's a 3% increase in testosterone.
[10608.00 - 10616.00] P:1529.68 E:0.095284 |  I mean, we underestimated how much of an advantage it is having, you know, the World Cup on home territory.
[10616.00 - 10620.00] P:1524.48 E:0.101718 |  And this isn't really home territory, but it kind of is, right?
[10620.00 - 10625.00] P:1566.51 E:0.092827 |  I mean, 15,000 Moroccans living in Qatar, tens of thousands have made the trip over,
[10625.00 - 10630.00] P:1484.07 E:0.094179 |  and then you also have the Espresso from, you know, the Algerian Dastro in Qatar, the Tunisian Dastro in Qatar,
[10630.00 - 10632.00] P:1380.47 E:0.089574 |  and even local Qatar is supporting this team.
[10632.00 - 10635.00] P:1363.02 E:0.083084 |  So those intangibles, as you've already pointed out, Kavi, I think are making all the difference.
[10635.00 - 10640.00] P:1707.49 E:0.094957 |  And when you're playing in a tournament where you can get through on, you know, penalty shootouts,
[10640.00 - 10645.00] P:1426.19 E:0.084001 |  and you have a good organized defense, I think those intangibles can make all the difference in the world.
[10645.00 - 10650.00] P:1757.01 E:0.092682 |  A World Service football correspondent, John Bennett is inside Education City Stadium
[10650.00 - 10652.00] P:1825.70 E:0.094740 |  and is joined, Pat and Vicky.
[10652.00 - 10658.00] P:1820.59 E:0.100874 |  John, first of all, is there any sign that anybody might want to leave this place?
[10658.00 - 10663.00] P:1941.65 E:0.106607 |  No, there isn't. Wow. I don't think I've experienced many atmospheres like that.
[10663.00 - 10669.00] P:1776.01 E:0.085226 |  I've been to five Africa Cup of Nations tournaments before, but that was something else.
[10669.00 - 10673.00] P:1797.19 E:0.107059 |  When the Spain players, as I'm sure you heard, were stepping up to take the penalties,
[10673.00 - 10675.00] P:1796.53 E:0.094532 |  the whistles were deafening.
[10675.00 - 10679.00] P:1879.07 E:0.099543 |  I don't think many footballers could cope in those conditions.
[10679.00 - 10682.00] P:1749.47 E:0.103389 |  And here, Mejia is absolutely spot on.
[10682.00 - 10688.00] P:1787.65 E:0.096244 |  I think the atmosphere had such a big part to play in this Morocco performance today
[10688.00 - 10691.00] P:1736.66 E:0.102928 |  and their performances during the whole tournament.
[10691.00 - 10695.00] P:1876.89 E:0.097383 |  And I have to, as well, take my hat off to Waleed Regragi, the head coach.
[10695.00 - 10699.00] P:1812.64 E:0.108576 |  He only took over, well, 80 days before the tournament started.
[10699.00 - 10701.00] P:1837.66 E:0.096986 |  What a job he has done.
[10701.00 - 10705.00] P:1714.46 E:0.100619 |  I was in the pretty much press conference yesterday and I was so impressed with him, Kelly.
[10705.00 - 10708.00] P:1856.45 E:0.092854 |  For one thing, he spoke in four different languages.
[10708.00 - 10711.00] P:1750.66 E:0.102887 |  The second thing, he kept everyone so calm.
[10711.00 - 10715.00] P:1914.58 E:0.106170 |  Everyone was trying to hype the game up, but he took the pressure off his players,
[10715.00 - 10719.00] P:1856.80 E:0.092787 |  but he was confident. He said, we're going to come out swinging.
[10719.00 - 10723.00] P:1738.40 E:0.103922 |  And that's exactly what they did. They took the game to Spain.
[10723.00 - 10730.00] P:1738.59 E:0.096892 |  I know at times there weren't many chances, but it was such a controlled performance from Morocco today.
[10730.00 - 10733.00] P:1739.96 E:0.079089 |  And I think they deserve to be in the last day.
[10733.00 - 10737.00] P:1812.61 E:0.087776 |  John, does Pat have his microphone or are you using Pat's?
[10737.00 - 10739.00] P:1778.41 E:0.121360 |  No, no, I've got mine.
[10739.00 - 10741.00] P:1611.44 E:0.098273 |  Oh, you're still there? I was just... No, no, no.
[10741.00 - 10746.00] P:1822.42 E:0.102455 |  I was going to ask you because, as John mentioned there, and Mejia was telling us as well,
[10746.00 - 10753.00] P:1821.42 E:0.099411 |  and you and Vicky have described, behind both goals there was this huge Morocco presence.
[10753.00 - 10755.00] P:1547.22 E:0.102232 |  And there was all that whistling inside the stadium.
[10755.00 - 10759.00] P:1701.52 E:0.096122 |  Every time the Spain players were going up to take their penalties,
[10759.00 - 10762.00] P:1876.74 E:0.088882 |  as a player, does that make a difference?
[10762.00 - 10770.00] P:1815.61 E:0.096107 |  Do you, even if you can maybe tune out with your hearing, do you absorb that energy?
[10770.00 - 10775.00] P:1856.35 E:0.093398 |  Well, different for different players, obviously, but the vast majority, of course it does.
[10775.00 - 10777.00] P:1796.68 E:0.096221 |  We're human beings.
[10777.00 - 10783.00] P:1881.43 E:0.100928 |  With all those tens of thousands of people screaming, shouting, whistling, trying to put you off,
[10783.00 - 10788.00] P:1761.77 E:0.102191 |  it's a wee bit harder than the same amount of people cheering you on.
[10788.00 - 10790.00] P:1946.60 E:0.100371 |  So what an advantage you gave them.
[10790.00 - 10794.00] P:1989.58 E:0.093490 |  We talked about it during the game, that if they could just get to these penalty kicks,
[10794.00 - 10798.00] P:1844.82 E:0.099102 |  that is one massive advantage that Morocco were going to have.
[10798.00 - 10804.00] P:1835.89 E:0.094264 |  And as I say, when Spain won the toss-up, and he's thinking, where do I go?
[10804.00 - 10809.00] P:1898.79 E:0.103322 |  Both sides of Morocco have nowhere to turn because the noise is going to be deafening.
[10809.00 - 10812.00] P:1863.42 E:0.098961 |  I was just thinking, you were talking about the Moroccan fans.
[10812.00 - 10815.00] P:1912.28 E:0.089840 |  See if you've got a flat nose, they're sook tonight.
[10815.00 - 10817.00] P:1811.99 E:0.111444 |  Don't bother, don't go to bed, you're wasting your time.
[10817.00 - 10819.00] P:1933.53 E:0.113039 |  I think the tournament needed this though.
[10819.00 - 10825.00] P:1808.74 E:0.097984 |  I really think the tournament needed one of Saudi Arabia, Morocco or Tunisia to go really far,
[10825.00 - 10830.00] P:1797.00 E:0.101588 |  to go deep in the tournament because their fans have really created something special in the city,
[10830.00 - 10836.00] P:1799.01 E:0.102319 |  not only in the stadiums but as Pat is saying, in the souk, around different areas of the city.
[10836.00 - 10839.00] P:1738.08 E:0.110312 |  They've really created a different atmosphere at this World Cup.
[10839.00 - 10843.00] P:1816.66 E:0.101719 |  So obviously the Spain fans won't like me saying this, but for the tournament,
[10843.00 - 10846.00] P:1674.98 E:0.101192 |  I think it's fantastic to have Morocco in the last eight.
[10846.00 - 10849.00] P:1767.83 E:0.085610 |  By the way, I've changed my mind. I think they've got a chance.
[10849.00 - 10851.00] P:1762.16 E:0.099598 |  I think they've got a chance in the next game.
[10851.00 - 10854.00] P:1912.14 E:0.065365 |  Right afterwards, I was talking to Vicky.
[10854.00 - 10858.00] P:1744.12 E:0.093422 |  But they're going to have these fans behind them again.
[10858.00 - 10862.00] P:1638.06 E:0.096606 |  They're going to have such belief. They have won the World Cup and now they're fearless.
[10862.00 - 10864.00] P:1681.72 E:0.109802 |  It makes you all go and enjoy it.
[10864.00 - 10867.00] P:1825.41 E:0.076902 |  So I've changed my mind. I think they've got a great good chance.
[10867.00 - 10869.00] P:1873.92 E:0.117827 |  I'm also watching.
[10869.00 - 10871.00] P:1809.74 E:0.095380 |  They have a fantastic chance.
[10871.00 - 10874.00] P:1902.91 E:0.096513 |  Sorry Kelly, I think it all comes from the head coach.
[10874.00 - 10877.00] P:1931.79 E:0.112427 |  He has given these players so much freedom, so much belief.
[10877.00 - 10879.00] P:1851.55 E:0.088842 |  And I don't think they will fear anyone going forward.
[10879.00 - 10882.00] P:1621.58 E:0.094517 |  I think they've got a great chance in the quarterfinals.
[10882.00 - 10886.00] P:1725.16 E:0.097156 |  And as Mahir was saying, they've got a way of harnessing that emotion
[10886.00 - 10889.00] P:1784.70 E:0.101813 |  and being able to channel it and use it positively.
[10889.00 - 10894.00] P:1586.36 E:0.096646 |  And that is something that may well help them when they take on either Portugal or Switzerland.
[10894.00 - 10900.00] P:1726.24 E:0.093691 |  We'll learn which of those two they'll be facing when that one kicks off at 7 o'clock UK time.
[10900.00 - 10903.00] P:1590.34 E:0.108688 |  I'm just watching on local television here in Doha.
[10903.00 - 10909.00] P:1752.33 E:0.095609 |  They've got a camera in Casablanca, inside a fan area in Casablanca.
[10909.00 - 10915.00] P:1744.46 E:0.094065 |  And the celebrations there are as wild as anything that we're seeing inside the Education City Stadium here.
[10915.00 - 10918.00] P:1584.48 E:0.102526 |  As Morocco advanced to the quarterfinals.
[10918.00 - 10920.00] P:1751.95 E:0.083274 |  So there's real celebration from there.
[10920.00 - 10926.00] P:1782.90 E:0.095575 |  Bono the hero with two penalties saved from Soler and from Busquets to give Morocco the chance.
[10926.00 - 10928.00] P:1895.94 E:0.086515 |  And Hakimi the chance.
[10928.00 - 10934.00] P:1772.27 E:0.097854 |  Hakimi of course as Vicky was telling us, born in Madrid and knocked Spain out of this World Cup.
[10934.00 - 10939.00] P:1718.98 E:0.094261 |  And Michael Colfield, the sports psychologist, says when people Google Bono in the future,
[10939.00 - 10945.00] P:1723.63 E:0.094571 |  the first thing you might get is a beautiful image of a Moroccan goalkeeper in the future.
[10945.00 - 10947.00] P:1961.04 E:0.105962 |  Guillem Balagay joins us now.
[10947.00 - 10952.00] P:1825.85 E:0.095514 |  Guillem, the flip side of all this celebration and this beautiful moment for Morocco
[10952.00 - 10957.00] P:1726.04 E:0.090739 |  and for their national team is that Spain are out of this tournament.
[10957.00 - 10961.00] P:1674.30 E:0.107310 |  A lot of the talk beforehand was about how young and inexperienced they were,
[10961.00 - 10963.00] P:1661.50 E:0.081364 |  how this maybe wasn't the tournament for them.
[10963.00 - 10970.00] P:1813.27 E:0.098365 |  But there have been moments from Spain that suggested maybe they might be maturing a little earlier than this.
[10970.00 - 10974.00] P:1795.44 E:0.078679 |  What's your first thoughts on Spain's exit from this World Cup?
[10974.00 - 10979.00] P:1741.09 E:0.088438 |  I could see coming. Many, many could see coming.
[10979.00 - 10982.00] P:1580.63 E:0.084788 |  And it's not just the fact that penalty anything can happen.
[10982.00 - 10988.00] P:1756.09 E:0.099521 |  It's just that you could see the progression in a tournament and this is no time to react,
[10988.00 - 10993.00] P:1711.66 E:0.088748 |  no time really to get better unless you are in the right dynamic and Spain wasn't.
[10993.00 - 10998.00] P:1715.92 E:0.094736 |  Start with Costa Rica doing well with Germany, we could have lost, lose against Japan.
[10998.00 - 11001.00] P:1620.60 E:0.092316 |  And here you have to say Morocco played better.
[11001.00 - 11003.00] P:1665.43 E:0.101723 |  And I'm not sure what Lucerne De Cours said about that,
[11003.00 - 11007.00] P:1729.10 E:0.080652 |  but they played better because they were closer to their game plan.
[11008.00 - 11013.00] P:1716.44 E:0.093677 |  So do you think Spain got their game plan wrong or they didn't execute it properly?
[11013.00 - 11016.00] P:1743.79 E:0.086005 |  The game plan is the one that we have.
[11016.00 - 11020.00] P:1726.84 E:0.095425 |  The problem is, and there is no other, Lucian-Ricke insisted on this,
[11020.00 - 11023.00] P:1757.53 E:0.082591 |  we got one way of playing and this is it.
[11023.00 - 11025.00] P:1758.80 E:0.106064 |  And it works well against bigger sides.
[11025.00 - 11029.00] P:1728.00 E:0.086713 |  I was hoping, against hope, that we could go through this.
[11029.00 - 11032.00] P:1784.34 E:0.079365 |  You wouldn't be impressed, nobody would.
[11032.00 - 11035.00] P:1641.11 E:0.095034 |  But then against bigger sides you're going to see a better Spain
[11035.00 - 11040.00] P:1545.65 E:0.091789 |  because there is a bit more space because they are size from now on that is wonderful as well.
[11040.00 - 11045.00] P:1678.76 E:0.088283 |  But against teams like Morocco, fingers crossed we don't concede in a counter,
[11045.00 - 11047.00] P:1639.31 E:0.096100 |  fingers crossed we don't concede in a set piece
[11047.00 - 11050.00] P:1621.34 E:0.096942 |  and fingers crossed at some point something happens that benefits us,
[11050.00 - 11052.00] P:1684.69 E:0.081167 |  but it just didn't happen.
[11052.00 - 11057.00] P:1596.40 E:0.076539 |  And that has to have, you have to put some questions on the table.
[11057.00 - 11061.00] P:1574.35 E:0.081859 |  Why don't we shoot from outside the box?
[11061.00 - 11063.00] P:1578.91 E:0.086152 |  Why aren't we good at set pieces?
[11063.00 - 11067.00] P:1594.37 E:0.092766 |  Why don't we have a striker that can hold the ball when we are under pressure?
[11067.00 - 11070.00] P:1654.69 E:0.078532 |  Why are we not more physical?
[11070.00 - 11074.00] P:1761.15 E:0.081289 |  And why have we chosen just one way of playing?
[11074.00 - 11079.00] P:1617.86 E:0.078872 |  It's disappointing, but I could see coming.
[11079.00 - 11084.00] P:1664.70 E:0.088553 |  You sound frustrated, Guillem, do you see this as a wasted opportunity at this tournament?
[11084.00 - 11086.00] P:1651.18 E:0.089208 |  Oh no, no, no.
[11086.00 - 11090.00] P:1754.37 E:0.088236 |  We're not, nowhere close to France, to England, to Brazil or to Argentina.
[11090.00 - 11094.00] P:1666.19 E:0.092759 |  We're nowhere close, we don't have that special player that Argentina have
[11094.00 - 11096.00] P:1575.73 E:0.087367 |  and obviously France as well.
[11096.00 - 11100.00] P:1630.78 E:0.060800 |  We don't have the prowess up front like you have.
