[0.00 - 4.28] P:1561.31 E:0.084646 |  Evening. Welcome to the Olympic Stadium in Berlin.
[4.28 - 8.60] P:1769.79 E:0.094300 |  England's man came so close to a Euro's win three years ago
[8.60 - 11.48] P:1286.29 E:0.077823 |  before losing the final on penalties.
[11.48 - 13.72] P:1400.91 E:0.084866 |  So, the wait goes on.
[13.72 - 15.72] P:778.09 E:0.079537 |  MUSIC PLAYS
[19.36 - 22.12] P:1813.64 E:0.099575 |  Now, what must make this particularly satisfactory for you?
[22.12 - 24.44] P:1604.09 E:0.086753 |  Not just Bobby's play for England, but Jack too.
[24.44 - 27.00] P:1857.98 E:0.089784 |  Yes, it's not right to have so much pride
[27.00 - 29.24] P:1488.65 E:0.071214 |  as when the balls broke under the tunnel.
[29.24 - 31.24] P:1514.28 E:0.088655 |  I'm not a woman that gets carried away,
[31.24 - 34.44] P:1450.33 E:0.085399 |  but I think this is the highlight of anybody's life.
[34.44 - 38.84] P:1144.09 E:0.095841 |  We've had all kinds of other methods to keep them going
[38.84 - 41.32] P:1127.55 E:0.072020 |  whilst we've waited for this final coming along.
[41.32 - 44.32] P:943.90 E:0.096054 |  We've had a half-accounted man putting tournament,
[44.32 - 46.76] P:1324.26 E:0.107461 |  and then this evening we'll go to a local cinema.
[46.76 - 48.76] P:1635.97 E:0.113125 |  BELL RINGING
[50.76 - 52.76] P:1683.48 E:0.125701 |  And here comes Hirst. He's got...
[52.76 - 55.76] P:1677.06 E:0.115228 |  Some people are on the pitch. They think it's all over.
[55.76 - 58.24] P:1858.80 E:0.119180 |  It is now. It's four.
[58.24 - 60.96] P:1338.95 E:0.091533 |  All your instructions to the team at halftime, Mr Ramsey?
[60.96 - 62.96] P:891.24 E:0.085101 |  My instructions to the team at halftime.
[62.96 - 65.44] P:1029.72 E:0.104974 |  I haven't the faith. I can't remember. I don't think I told them anything.
[65.44 - 66.44] P:1340.71 E:0.078251 |  Did you not? Yeah.
[66.44 - 70.96] P:1622.62 E:0.079960 |  And it's her Majesty the Queen shaking hands at this moment with Bobby Moore.
[70.96 - 74.76] P:1159.39 E:0.076925 |  Well, Bobby, how are you feeling now? You look a little ruffled.
[74.76 - 76.24] P:1525.70 E:0.086056 |  I feel a little ruffled, Ken.
[76.24 - 78.76] P:1655.83 E:0.121728 |  It's your reme it's okay for England.
[78.76 - 80.52] P:1607.85 E:0.114704 |  CHEERING
[80.52 - 84.44] P:1772.23 E:0.113680 |  It's only 12 inches high, solid gold,
[84.44 - 87.76] P:1707.09 E:0.106240 |  and it means England are the world champion.
[87.76 - 89.76] P:1356.26 E:0.086576 |  It's the best.
[89.76 - 91.76] P:978.87 E:0.084708 |  MUSIC
[91.76 - 93.76] P:789.73 E:0.048749 |  BELL RINGING
[102.76 - 105.76] P:1208.71 E:0.093397 |  It's one small step for man.
[107.76 - 109.76] P:1150.16 E:0.104551 |  One giant leap for man.
[109.76 - 112.76] P:1749.66 E:0.108819 |  Hey! What a thing!
[112.76 - 116.76] P:1869.39 E:0.105857 |  You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.
[116.76 - 119.76] P:1590.66 E:0.094655 |  At dot 3D, oldest smile.
[119.76 - 122.76] P:1762.45 E:0.096769 |  I'm playing all the right moves.
[122.76 - 124.76] P:985.28 E:0.075586 |  But not necessary.
[124.76 - 126.76] P:1699.81 E:0.109635 |  And the right order.
[126.76 - 129.76] P:1570.12 E:0.103018 |  The four-e-lil Keegan! Oh, super-go, by Kevin Keegan!
[129.76 - 132.76] P:1782.00 E:0.107053 |  Red Robb has done it for a four-time!
[132.76 - 134.76] P:1704.32 E:0.107833 |  MUSIC
[134.76 - 136.76] P:1910.77 E:0.092883 |  We hope we know education.
[136.76 - 139.76] P:1503.65 E:0.104011 |  The chance here for Brookings. Brookings scored, you know.
[139.76 - 142.76] P:1285.02 E:0.084854 |  Whether it's discord, may we ring harmony?
[142.76 - 146.76] P:1079.95 E:0.095885 |  You boys took the hell of a beating.
[146.76 - 148.76] P:1266.64 E:0.106362 |  What a brilliant go-by John Vaughn!
[148.76 - 150.76] P:1483.05 E:0.083185 |  It's saddest, most for-lawn figure,
[150.76 - 152.76] P:1489.80 E:0.074311 |  as Brian Robson is head on his chest.
[152.76 - 154.76] P:1844.29 E:0.108993 |  Relax!
[154.76 - 157.76] P:1457.39 E:0.100352 |  And that is why Maradona's the greatest player in the world.
[157.76 - 159.76] P:1767.18 E:0.095842 |  He buried the English defense.
[160.76 - 163.76] P:1826.10 E:0.121335 |  Round the world, it's time for Live Aid.
[163.76 - 165.76] P:1962.80 E:0.112774 |  Hooray, Hooray!
[165.76 - 168.76] P:1923.42 E:0.119941 |  And the English defense must carry in the blame for that.
[168.76 - 170.76] P:1381.55 E:0.105281 |  Standing on top of the Berlin Wall,
[170.76 - 173.76] P:1773.38 E:0.100837 |  which for years has been the most potent symbol of the division of Europe.
[174.76 - 176.76] P:1882.05 E:0.116366 |  What as good as anybody in the top?
[176.76 - 179.76] P:1846.85 E:0.102771 |  Wobble has ballooned it over the bar!
[179.76 - 181.76] P:1768.30 E:0.106771 |  Can we not knock it?
[181.76 - 184.76] P:1605.40 E:0.127310 |  You've got a roll in it, you've got a...
[184.76 - 186.76] P:1640.74 E:0.113615 |  There's Gascoigne. Oh, brilliant!
[186.76 - 188.76] P:1763.65 E:0.112042 |  Oh, yes! Oh, no!
[188.76 - 191.76] P:1676.53 E:0.081491 |  Obviously very upset, particularly for Gareth, of course.
[191.76 - 194.76] P:1696.89 E:0.122949 |  Come on, I really, really, really want a zig-zag, ah!
[194.76 - 196.76] P:1724.07 E:0.105567 |  A new dawn has broken, has it not?
[196.76 - 199.76] P:1682.54 E:0.121762 |  And it seems to me...
[199.76 - 201.76] P:1626.24 E:0.097461 |  Iceberg, right ahead!
[202.76 - 205.76] P:1910.79 E:0.105733 |  Oh, he's sent back a moth! Oh, my words!
[205.76 - 208.76] P:1708.85 E:0.089177 |  The position had become increasingly untenable
[208.76 - 210.76] P:1332.46 E:0.082640 |  for both the FA and for Glenn.
[210.76 - 213.76] P:1806.95 E:0.093420 |  You can't tell me what to do, you ain't my mother!
[213.76 - 215.76] P:1787.99 E:0.102462 |  Yes, I am!
[215.76 - 219.76] P:1782.49 E:0.093656 |  Two aircraft have crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York.
[219.76 - 221.76] P:1849.07 E:0.108347 |  Oh, and Siemens lost it!
[222.76 - 225.76] P:1842.76 E:0.118869 |  The Portuguese goalkeeper can send in Lidder!
[225.76 - 228.76] P:1113.86 E:0.098664 |  They've been very good in training, but when we come into these final stages,
[228.76 - 231.76] P:1137.63 E:0.099630 |  we miss it and I'm very sorry for the fans.
[232.76 - 235.76] P:1199.09 E:0.100996 |  And the Bulls are for England and for Steve McLaren.
[235.76 - 237.76] P:1538.05 E:0.108311 |  Nice to see you all, the fans' been here.
[237.76 - 240.76] P:1581.52 E:0.112349 |  It's the Bulls' party. Surely crossed the line!
[240.76 - 242.76] P:1563.51 E:0.098494 |  It's not being given!
[242.76 - 244.76] P:943.51 E:0.100790 |  The Golden Generation's a silly phrase anyway.
[244.76 - 246.76] P:1665.94 E:0.113585 |  A water to the city of London.
[246.76 - 248.76] P:1710.90 E:0.113603 |  There are wind down!
[248.76 - 251.76] P:1750.09 E:0.104466 |  And the British man has just won Wimbledon!
[251.76 - 255.76] P:1408.81 E:0.114593 |  Luis Suarez was a man on a mission as he put England on the verge of a World Cup exit.
[255.76 - 260.76] P:1405.21 E:0.101500 |  Halideis has been out of work since losing the England job after just 67 days
[260.76 - 262.76] P:1189.81 E:0.101836 |  in the wake of a newspaper sting.
[262.76 - 265.76] P:1573.14 E:0.091586 |  The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union.
[265.76 - 269.76] P:1650.43 E:0.112015 |  Croatia reaches the World Cup final.
[269.76 - 273.76] P:1534.76 E:0.104833 |  The ghost of 66 lives on for England.
[273.76 - 275.76] P:1342.41 E:0.095365 |  You must stay at home.
[275.76 - 278.76] P:1270.66 E:0.114364 |  No female rider has won the Grand National!
[278.76 - 280.76] P:1287.23 E:0.116105 |  Rachel Blackmore is out in front!
[280.76 - 286.76] P:1766.54 E:0.108545 |  Gareth Southgate's England losing a penalty shootout in the final.
[286.76 - 289.76] P:1813.63 E:0.116234 |  What a terrible twist for England.
[289.76 - 294.76] P:1645.42 E:0.115547 |  And Charlie Chloe Kelly could have won in an extra time for England!
[294.76 - 298.76] P:814.01 E:0.098955 |  Queen Elizabeth was 96 and her death brings to an end
[298.76 - 301.76] P:1044.29 E:0.081739 |  the longest reign in British history.
[301.76 - 306.76] P:1244.90 E:0.101177 |  Liz Tras has announced her resignation just 45 days after becoming Prime Minister.
[306.76 - 309.76] P:1076.23 E:0.111361 |  It's hard to describe Bobby Charlton in just a few words
[309.76 - 312.76] P:1057.47 E:0.104722 |  because he had such an incredibly long, illustrious and successful career.
[312.76 - 318.76] P:1356.03 E:0.101608 |  What Peck and what Jurgen and what Arson and all the great managers have done and are doing,
[318.76 - 320.76] P:1403.00 E:0.094279 |  Terry was doing that back in 96.
[320.76 - 322.76] P:1498.60 E:0.091830 |  I would love to keep playing but I can't.
[322.76 - 325.76] P:1615.87 E:0.093935 |  Physically it's just too tough now.
[325.76 - 331.76] P:1061.44 E:0.090321 |  Walk into the morning, the sunlight of hope getting stronger through the day.
[331.76 - 334.76] P:1161.72 E:0.079415 |  Change begins now.
[337.76 - 351.76] P:1592.12 E:0.074138 |  And if you are thinking now that your sporting, political and cultural life has just flashed before your ears,
[351.76 - 354.76] P:1450.80 E:0.061720 |  then you are not alone.
[354.76 - 360.76] P:1671.61 E:0.081537 |  58 years since England lifted the World Cup at Wembley.
[360.76 - 367.76] P:1657.63 E:0.083184 |  And now the men are trying to lift the Euros on a gloriously sunny evening
[367.76 - 370.76] P:1601.46 E:0.086150 |  here in the German capital, Berlin.
[370.76 - 372.76] P:1677.19 E:0.081604 |  Our correspondent, John Murray.
[372.76 - 374.76] P:1789.20 E:0.077282 |  I'll tell you what jumped out at me during the course of that.
[374.76 - 376.76] P:1866.79 E:0.104545 |  Was it more than wise?
[376.76 - 380.76] P:1657.93 E:0.076519 |  There are a number of things that jumped out at me during the course of that.
[380.76 - 385.76] P:1847.37 E:0.081970 |  But not least the famous iconic Norwegian commentary.
[385.76 - 391.76] P:1682.52 E:0.094640 |  And that's the reason why I'm so excited because on that night when England were beaten by Norway,
[391.76 - 397.76] P:1792.50 E:0.092840 |  Orga Harida was in that team and he was the manager of Iceland that beat England in the last match
[397.76 - 403.76] P:1751.14 E:0.091159 |  before this tournament when, let's be honest, after that defeat we wondered what would become of England.
[403.76 - 408.76] P:1741.16 E:0.077758 |  And even more so during the course of the group stage when some lows were hit.
[408.76 - 414.76] P:1697.82 E:0.092364 |  But I've just been at the back of this stadium with Matt Upsen who's here with us at the point where the gates were open
[414.76 - 421.76] P:1724.18 E:0.087480 |  and running in through the turnstiles to get into their position because this is big history tonight for England.
[421.76 - 428.76] P:1700.98 E:0.095549 |  Never appeared in a major men's tournament final outside, not only outside England, outside Wembley Stadium.
[428.76 - 430.76] P:1586.81 E:0.093189 |  And here we are in Berlin witnessing this.
[430.76 - 437.76] P:1737.63 E:0.084950 |  This could be one of those nights, one of those occasions that will very much have its place
[437.76 - 440.76] P:1630.27 E:0.091774 |  in the list of events that we just heard at the start of the programme.
[440.76 - 443.76] P:1694.36 E:0.103796 |  Matt Upsen, you'd be mentioned. You were out there with John?
[443.76 - 451.76] P:1797.15 E:0.077352 |  Yeah, we were just getting some light refreshment before the proceedings begin and it is just magnificent.
[451.76 - 460.76] P:1793.32 E:0.089691 |  The feel of this ground, driving in, seeing it, the history, the quality of how it shines outside
[460.76 - 465.76] P:1713.81 E:0.092346 |  and you come in, it dips all the way down into a pitch that's a lot lower than ground level.
[465.76 - 470.76] P:1764.12 E:0.100758 |  It's absolutely stunning and it's a huge arena and like John said, there are a lot of fans sprinting
[470.76 - 476.76] P:1675.32 E:0.095163 |  through that turnstile, they were sprinting to be the first in the stadium, get their seat, get settled in anticipation
[476.76 - 479.76] P:1705.24 E:0.098645 |  for what is just a huge night for England.
[479.76 - 488.76] P:1768.36 E:0.092737 |  It is a city that doesn't hide from its history, whether that has been good or bad over many centuries.
[488.76 - 495.76] P:1722.78 E:0.091867 |  The bell from the 1936 Olympics, John, is outside this ground.
[495.76 - 503.76] P:1642.85 E:0.090046 |  It is there as a piece of history, but as a reminder of what came after that Olympics.
[503.76 - 510.76] P:1695.85 E:0.089584 |  There is history everywhere you look in this stadium and of course in this city.
[510.76 - 516.76] P:1760.36 E:0.094926 |  Every brick in this stadium, it feels like, has a story to tell.
[516.76 - 520.76] P:1707.64 E:0.103284 |  It's been brilliantly redesigned this stadium, it's one of the best stadiums in the world, I would say.
[520.76 - 525.76] P:1691.45 E:0.099974 |  You're absolutely right, for example, first thing this morning I was out up at the Berlin Wall Memorial,
[525.76 - 528.76] P:1695.23 E:0.096816 |  which on a Sunday morning, I didn't really think of it in those terms,
[528.76 - 533.76] P:1761.96 E:0.089116 |  but being there on a Sunday morning in the advance of what we're about to see here,
[533.76 - 539.76] P:1778.94 E:0.093083 |  that is proper history, but we've got sporting history with the potential of being in the making tonight,
[539.76 - 545.76] P:1830.34 E:0.098166 |  not just for England, but for Spain as well, can become the first team to win the European Championship four times.
[545.76 - 550.76] P:1767.98 E:0.089320 |  There are plenty of notable achievements that the Spanish side could notch up as well.
[550.76 - 556.76] P:1723.79 E:0.099490 |  Izzy Christensen, former England international, has been part of our team for every single
[556.76 - 562.76] P:1741.34 E:0.092421 |  England game at this tournament, and you always thought England would get here, didn't you?
[562.76 - 567.76] P:1609.08 E:0.099990 |  I did, I've been there from the very start, even in the group stages,
[567.76 - 572.76] P:1667.43 E:0.093668 |  which seems like a long while ago when England were not playing particularly well,
[572.76 - 578.76] P:1721.89 E:0.090710 |  but they just seem to have gathered this unbelievable momentum and spirit within the group,
[578.76 - 583.76] P:1687.43 E:0.091049 |  and that is why we're here, and I echo what the guys have said.
[583.76 - 590.76] P:1719.95 E:0.091568 |  It is absolutely incredible this place, the luxury of being here very early to be able to absorb everything,
[590.76 - 596.76] P:1776.25 E:0.088431 |  and where I'm sitting behind the pitch, behind the goal, which let's just hope it's just one-half,
[596.76 - 603.76] P:1671.03 E:0.088237 |  that Jordan Pickford is going to be defending, that this is just an amazing place, and what a pride to be here.
[603.76 - 612.76] P:1639.77 E:0.098756 |  Izzy is behind the goal away to our left, there are TV cabins that have been built for all the different TV broadcasts behind her.
[612.76 - 616.76] P:1854.90 E:0.092003 |  The sun is shining, or maybe a third of this pitch at the moment.
[616.76 - 622.76] P:1826.96 E:0.095133 |  There are broadcasting crews along the whole of this near-side touchline.
[622.76 - 628.76] P:1791.00 E:0.094835 |  The actual trophy is gleaming in the sunshine, just level with the penalty area.
[628.76 - 635.76] P:1674.01 E:0.103715 |  At the end, Izzy is watching. A whole load of UEFA dignitaries are down below in the mouth of the tunnel.
[635.76 - 645.76] P:1645.42 E:0.098822 |  I can see David Moyes there as well, Rafael Benitez, so they are all the technical advisors and assessors that UEFA have had at this tournament.
[645.76 - 650.76] P:1649.20 E:0.097738 |  Chris Sutton also part of our team. What are your initial? You don't have to look surprised.
[650.76 - 653.76] P:1738.25 E:0.106727 |  I was always going to bring you in here. What are your initial thoughts?
[653.76 - 658.76] P:1506.35 E:0.094764 |  I didn't know. I was on this particular part, but no, thanks for inviting me on.
[658.76 - 662.76] P:1552.97 E:0.100119 |  It's a brilliant moment. You've got to savour these moments.
[662.76 - 670.76] P:1593.98 E:0.101119 |  England in major finals hasn't happened too often, so you've got to smell it in, drink it in.
[670.76 - 678.76] P:1632.87 E:0.096547 |  What an opportunity for this England team who didn't start the tournament great, but they're finishing it okay.
[678.76 - 685.76] P:1655.26 E:0.094413 |  They're going to have to go up another level or two to beat this Spanish team, but it's all about the opportunity.
[685.76 - 693.76] P:1675.82 E:0.102094 |  John Murray has had his binoculars on the UEFA dignitaries and he's smirking, which either means I have mistook David Moyes or Rafael Benitez,
[693.76 - 695.76] P:1544.45 E:0.101336 |  or there's somebody completely random in the middle.
[695.76 - 700.76] P:1782.73 E:0.108770 |  I'm smiling because Fabio Capello was down there. Nice of Fabio to be here tonight.
[700.76 - 707.76] P:1770.88 E:0.103647 |  Avram Grant as well was also part of that group down there, but particularly Fabio Capello immediately makes me think of Sven Joranetti.
[707.76 - 715.76] P:1729.07 E:0.096268 |  Sven Joranetti makes me think of Sven Joranetti as well. I think everyone will know that Sven's health is clearly very, very, very poor.
[715.76 - 719.76] P:1666.35 E:0.104181 |  I wonder whether he'll be keeping an eye on this here tonight as well, if he can.
[719.76 - 731.76] P:1664.15 E:0.101217 |  Absolutely. That is our team inside the stadium. Plenty to come between now and kickoff, which is at 8 o'clock UK time, 9 o'clock here in the German capital.
[731.76 - 739.76] P:1701.05 E:0.100998 |  Let's bring in Alan Shearer next. I spoke to him a little earlier about what will be going through the England players' minds over the last 24 hours or so.
[739.76 - 747.76] P:1914.42 E:0.083656 |  Excited, nervous. You just couldn't wait to get out there and play because you've spoken so much, listened to everything.
[747.76 - 752.76] P:1884.93 E:0.082004 |  You've played the semi-final and that's the result you wanted.
[752.76 - 758.76] P:1773.64 E:0.087795 |  You just want to get out onto the grass and start warming up and playing and starting to do your stuff.
[758.76 - 769.76] P:1571.79 E:0.076334 |  Do you think from what you've seen as the tournament has progressed, they have played with less pressure and less fear, as Garry Southgate has said?
[769.76 - 778.76] P:1691.05 E:0.069560 |  Well, their performances have been better. Certainly quarter-final was, you could see, shoots of improvement.
[778.76 - 783.76] P:1719.71 E:0.082095 |  Semi-final, it was the best 45 minutes we've seen in the tournament from them.
[784.76 - 790.76] P:1708.19 E:0.080323 |  Field forwarding, I thought, was magnificent. May and here, I thought, was magnificent also.
[792.76 - 804.76] P:1702.89 E:0.080804 |  But look, we've all had to put up with that word pressure at some stage. You don't get to elite top-level sport, top-level football without having any pressure.
[804.76 - 810.76] P:1956.20 E:0.090003 |  Unfortunately, or fortunately, because some people live off that, they feed off that. They want that.
[810.76 - 820.76] P:1878.80 E:0.083466 |  So pressure comes with being an England footballer. And now I get these, there might be more because I and other players before me and after me
[820.76 - 830.76] P:1830.92 E:0.085154 |  weren't able to deliver that trophy. But 66 was the last time it happened and we've all had to carry that burden at times
[830.76 - 838.76] P:1852.91 E:0.083371 |  and it sometimes has been a burden. But this is a really, really, really talented squad who have got an incredible chance to make history.
[838.76 - 845.76] P:1658.23 E:0.078919 |  Joe Hart gave me a real insight into that, this lunchtime, when he was on five live with us, about, and he said,
[845.76 - 851.76] P:1641.03 E:0.060970 |  two or three minutes before the end of the Iceland defeat, he was standing in goal thinking,
[851.76 - 856.76] P:1576.23 E:0.080779 |  right, what am I going to explain this? What am I going to be asked about here? How are we going to get hammered?
[856.76 - 864.76] P:1698.07 E:0.079214 |  How do I explain the way everything has happened? And that was such an insight into what can go through when it isn't going well.
[864.76 - 871.76] P:1810.57 E:0.079079 |  And I wonder whether, and I asked him this as well, those thoughts get less as you progress through a tournament.
[871.76 - 881.76] P:1756.07 E:0.075693 |  Yeah, but I think that's where you have to give Gareth Salki great credit because he's been through the pain of missing a penalty.
[881.76 - 892.76] P:1832.50 E:0.080060 |  He's been through the hurt of losing the semi-final. He's also been in squads where perhaps the togetherness wasn't as big or as good as it should have been.
[892.76 - 901.76] P:1786.40 E:0.072148 |  So what he's done as England manager is that he's tried to rectify what wasn't perhaps correct when he was playing.
[901.76 - 909.76] P:1802.11 E:0.081338 |  And one of the big things that he's done is that togetherness and team spirit and belief and keep going to the end and finding a way.
[909.76 - 914.76] P:1984.03 E:0.089228 |  We've all of us at some stage during this tournament have used those words.
[914.76 - 918.76] P:1851.41 E:0.086453 |  And I think that's what you have to admire most about this team.
[918.76 - 931.76] P:1751.03 E:0.071723 |  Now, they're a moments team because they've produced great moments at really critical, important times without playing free-flowing football,
[931.76 - 938.76] P:1798.91 E:0.072656 |  without showing the, perhaps, the ability or the attitude or whatever you want to call it.
[938.76 - 942.76] P:1812.99 E:0.092305 |  But that's okay, isn't it? Absolutely. There's no harm in that.
[942.76 - 950.76] P:1914.00 E:0.090583 |  And there's no harm in us or you or anyone else being analytical and critical and saying what's gone right and what's gone wrong.
[950.76 - 952.76] P:2016.09 E:0.071584 |  And you hear that, don't listen to the noise.
[952.76 - 957.76] P:1854.15 E:0.074708 |  Well, unfortunately, that's what comes with the territory of playing for England.
[957.76 - 966.76] P:1825.68 E:0.080939 |  And whilst you have the talent that this squad have, they have to finally get over the line because Gareth had us to a final.
[966.76 - 972.76] P:1968.02 E:0.093185 |  He's had us to a semi-final. Now, this is an unbelievable opportunity, as I said, for these guys to go and make history.
[972.76 - 974.76] P:1728.57 E:0.070106 |  What kind of game are you expecting?
[974.76 - 981.76] P:1821.28 E:0.077607 |  Well, I don't think Spain will change. They have their routine. They have how they want to press.
[981.76 - 988.76] P:1798.09 E:0.084462 |  They have how they want their wingers to stay wide and get the balls into the box and lots of crosses because that's what they do.
[988.76 - 995.76] P:1796.18 E:0.081977 |  And they won't change. So I'm hoping that because they want to play on the front foot, that might suit us.
[995.76 - 999.76] P:1729.52 E:0.081701 |  And there's no doubt about it that they do give chances away.
[999.76 - 1007.76] P:1745.11 E:0.088023 |  When you look at their game against Germany in the quarter-finals, I think it was, Germany had three, four, five really good opportunities.
[1007.76 - 1016.76] P:1730.40 E:0.081941 |  When you look at their game against France in the semi-final, France had two, maybe three really good chances, particularly the Mbappe one.
[1016.76 - 1025.76] P:1808.70 E:0.082351 |  So that, for me, is encouraging. If they can show the energy and the pace with the passing that they did in the first half against the Netherlands,
[1025.76 - 1031.76] P:1713.36 E:0.077607 |  then they will create chances and then it's up to them to try and take them. That will be the big difference in the game.
[1031.76 - 1035.76] P:1527.70 E:0.087630 |  The start of this season feels a very, very, very long time ago.
[1035.76 - 1043.76] P:1688.35 E:0.085644 |  I think our very first Sase 5-Life sport of the season, we talked about Erling Haarland because you'd gone to interview him pre-season.
[1043.76 - 1050.76] P:1666.40 E:0.086936 |  We talked about his age really and because of the age of our kids, whatever, actually marvelling at his composure at that age.
[1050.76 - 1059.76] P:1622.04 E:0.076160 |  We're going to see two players here tonight, one for Spain and one for England who are teenagers, in Yamal and Kobe Mane.
[1059.76 - 1060.76] P:1508.28 E:0.094035 |  I know.
[1060.76 - 1065.76] P:1610.76 E:0.074989 |  And their composure more than anything else is astounding.
[1065.76 - 1066.76] P:1950.81 E:0.109448 |  Well, he's 17 now, isn't he?
[1066.76 - 1068.76] P:2034.90 E:0.110809 |  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[1068.76 - 1072.76] P:1780.57 E:0.078939 |  Let's hope we had a few drinks to celebrate his birthday.
[1072.76 - 1074.76] P:1896.30 E:0.108721 |  If he can drink it, certainly.
[1074.76 - 1076.76] P:1751.02 E:0.088990 |  I think the constant that you can.
[1076.76 - 1077.76] P:1844.48 E:0.087728 |  All right, OK.
[1077.76 - 1078.76] P:1846.61 E:0.076500 |  Let's hope he did.
[1078.76 - 1080.76] P:1767.63 E:0.084942 |  But yeah, it's quite remarkable.
[1080.76 - 1087.76] P:1842.20 E:0.081671 |  I mean, the performances that both those guys have put in because it was a problem for England, the midfield.
[1087.76 - 1093.76] P:1814.16 E:0.086197 |  I mean, Gareth tried Trent in the first couple of games, then he put Conagallagher in and then once he released Kobe Mane,
[1093.76 - 1096.76] P:1722.94 E:0.082265 |  I think he's just been sensational.
[1096.76 - 1101.76] P:1843.86 E:0.083829 |  He's just taken everything in his stride, looked so comfortable in everything that he's done.
[1101.76 - 1103.76] P:1856.02 E:0.096700 |  And Yamal exactly the same.
[1103.76 - 1109.76] P:1819.65 E:0.092800 |  I mean, it is staggering what these youngsters have done and are doing.
[1109.76 - 1119.76] P:1867.32 E:0.083230 |  I mean, both players, you know, if either player, if Mane or if Yamal did something really special and won the trophy for their country tonight,
[1119.76 - 1121.76] P:1751.57 E:0.080540 |  they could end up playing the tournament.
[1121.76 - 1122.76] P:1516.59 E:0.044022 |  Yeah.
[1122.76 - 1127.76] P:1782.92 E:0.076890 |  Which at such young age, when you think about it, is remarkable.
[1127.76 - 1129.76] P:1849.72 E:0.118002 |  Alan Shearer, it's always to be a little earlier.
[1129.76 - 1132.76] P:1658.03 E:0.093222 |  And obviously, we did Google Drink The Age on the constant.
[1132.76 - 1134.76] P:1672.46 E:0.093920 |  He can't have a drink at the moment.
[1134.76 - 1136.76] P:1694.36 E:0.104552 |  He is underage.
[1136.76 - 1141.76] P:1754.67 E:0.101138 |  Group of England fans down below, given their biggest cheer of the afternoon so far to Kia Stammer,
[1141.76 - 1146.76] P:1753.97 E:0.107193 |  who has just come from an interview with Gary Neville to walk down the steps at the mouth of the tunnel.
[1146.76 - 1149.76] P:1779.53 E:0.090696 |  They're backing him over for a photo.
[1149.76 - 1153.76] P:1766.84 E:0.098887 |  And then the security kept it going down the stairs of the tunnel.
[1153.76 - 1159.76] P:1884.33 E:0.104018 |  The Spanish team with Ian Dennis, who has commentated on five of their six at this tournament.
[1159.76 - 1160.76] P:1888.45 E:0.052473 |  See.
[1160.76 - 1162.76] P:1871.11 E:0.093883 |  Great.
[1164.76 - 1167.76] P:1977.66 E:0.108854 |  The Spanish team, yes, they've made two changes from the...
[1167.76 - 1169.76] P:1985.87 E:0.111824 |  I thought you were going to say something else.
[1169.76 - 1173.76] P:1885.65 E:0.100926 |  The two changes from the semi-final against France as expected.
[1173.76 - 1177.76] P:1841.63 E:0.096621 |  Danny Carvajal and Robin Leigh-Norman both back from suspension.
[1177.76 - 1180.76] P:1858.00 E:0.103030 |  So they replace Jesus Navas and Nacho.
[1180.76 - 1182.76] P:1873.14 E:0.096185 |  Simon is in goal.
[1182.76 - 1187.76] P:1831.66 E:0.095816 |  Carvajal, Leigh-Norman, Le Porte, Cuccarea, Olmo, Rodri, Fabian,
[1187.76 - 1194.76] P:1905.83 E:0.101031 |  Yamal, who today actually becomes the youngest player to play in the major final at 17 years and a day.
[1194.76 - 1202.76] P:1814.78 E:0.097479 |  Nico Williams and Alvaro Morata and the England team bus is about two or three minutes away from arriving here in Berlin.
[1202.76 - 1208.76] P:1841.52 E:0.103077 |  We're going to get the England team a little bit later on because Guillain Balagay from EuroLeague
[1208.76 - 1212.76] P:1846.31 E:0.093216 |  and who is part of our coverage throughout the whole of the night tonight,
[1212.76 - 1215.76] P:1763.81 E:0.096337 |  spanned out of a problem with releasing their team early.
[1215.76 - 1217.76] P:1836.33 E:0.095227 |  It's all very grown up.
[1217.76 - 1218.76] P:1451.41 E:0.055841 |  It is now.
[1218.76 - 1222.76] P:1823.51 E:0.099365 |  Well, I was just thinking how many of these players would have started the tournament
[1222.76 - 1224.76] P:1723.05 E:0.093495 |  and you know, probably 10 out of 11.
[1224.76 - 1227.76] P:1827.62 E:0.109069 |  So there's not huge surprises that you can make anyway.
[1227.76 - 1233.76] P:1807.14 E:0.088661 |  I just knew that Danny Olmo eventually was going to start, but with Pedri getting injured, that came quicker.
[1233.76 - 1235.76] P:1705.53 E:0.102278 |  And then it was just the Grimaldo Cuccarea thing.
[1235.76 - 1237.76] P:1855.64 E:0.090521 |  Cuccarea has been doing so well on the left hand side.
[1237.76 - 1239.76] P:1706.56 E:0.099002 |  The rest, you can have it.
[1239.76 - 1241.76] P:1787.34 E:0.085301 |  Yeah, this is the 11.
[1241.76 - 1245.76] P:1887.42 E:0.101567 |  And I mean, that's a good thing for them because of how they've performed in this tournament.
[1245.76 - 1248.76] P:1838.95 E:0.080053 |  You know, there's been no need to change.
[1248.76 - 1255.76] P:1893.13 E:0.102871 |  There's been need like every other team to actually bring players on at key moments to change how the game is being played.
[1255.76 - 1258.76] P:1855.78 E:0.082510 |  Sorry, Andy, we're able to rest them on for the last group game.
[1258.76 - 1260.76] P:1878.98 E:0.084780 |  And you might have changed the majority of his team.
[1260.76 - 1265.76] P:1810.54 E:0.088962 |  Which, which, yeah, it was good for the likes of Roderick, who's played over 5,000 minutes already.
[1265.76 - 1270.76] P:1849.56 E:0.083818 |  But this, the foundations of this team has been there for a while.
[1270.76 - 1278.76] P:1997.11 E:0.084273 |  This is a team, the philosophy of which is be the best you can be, follow a bit of order, be generous and help your teammates.
[1278.76 - 1281.76] P:1804.76 E:0.072500 |  And then you go shoot, attack and see what happens.
[1281.76 - 1291.76] P:1828.69 E:0.097404 |  A team represented as we just seen them coming out by Nico Williams and Lameel Yamal, sons of African immigrants and leader manager who's never ever the story.
[1291.76 - 1294.76] P:1830.93 E:0.087127 |  So why is there not too like about this Spain?
[1294.76 - 1297.76] P:1854.80 E:0.100579 |  If you were in the final, you will be supporting Spain.
[1297.76 - 1301.76] P:1796.93 E:0.082665 |  As I say, you've done five of their six, Ian.
[1301.76 - 1303.76] P:1794.21 E:0.087939 |  What's not to like about them?
[1303.76 - 1305.76] P:1925.60 E:0.087538 |  That's very true actually.
[1305.76 - 1307.76] P:1800.15 E:0.108709 |  Well, there's a lot to like about them.
[1307.76 - 1311.76] P:1908.45 E:0.093839 |  I mean, Yamal and Williams are exciting on the flank.
[1311.76 - 1314.76] P:1890.85 E:0.084928 |  I know Gehrm is a huge fan of Olmo.
[1314.76 - 1320.76] P:1920.49 E:0.099085 |  He took his opportunity, although there was a lot of talk actually going into that quarterfinal against Germany.
[1320.76 - 1322.76] P:1841.22 E:0.102090 |  A lot of speculation that he was going to replace Petri.
[1322.76 - 1324.76] P:1894.23 E:0.097398 |  Petri was injured early.
[1324.76 - 1327.76] P:1923.01 E:0.089921 |  Olmo came on to good effect and has been outstanding.
[1327.76 - 1332.76] P:1804.81 E:0.094718 |  And we all know about what Roderick can do, but the player that I've liked the most is Fabian in the midfield.
[1332.76 - 1335.76] P:1924.13 E:0.094595 |  I think he's so composed on the ball.
[1335.76 - 1338.76] P:1936.18 E:0.088561 |  He's so effective. He's a modern day number eight.
[1338.76 - 1343.76] P:1952.82 E:0.093476 |  And I just think that he, for me, has been so consistent throughout this tournament.
[1343.76 - 1353.76] P:1972.32 E:0.089028 |  But that said, Cucarrea, who in this game, sorry, in this stadium in the opening game against Croatia made his first competitive start for Spain.
[1353.76 - 1356.76] P:1983.53 E:0.081408 |  I still don't think has been tested.
[1356.76 - 1360.76] P:1974.40 E:0.096805 |  There was a spell with Mussiala in Stuttgart in the quarterfinal.
[1360.76 - 1367.76] P:1923.65 E:0.084184 |  But I still think that Cucarrea can be exposed only because Spain, they do attack.
[1367.76 - 1371.76] P:1860.26 E:0.099600 |  The four backs will get forward and Cucarrea will support Williams at every opportunity.
[1371.76 - 1379.76] P:1922.12 E:0.090199 |  But Saka, and you can think back to April when Arsenal beat Chelsea 5-0, Cucarrea was at fault for four of the five goals.
[1379.76 - 1382.76] P:1872.01 E:0.090119 |  And I think that Saka can get the beating of Cucarrea.
[1382.76 - 1384.76] P:1929.06 E:0.104734 |  Chris, you did the semi-final in MENIUM.
[1384.76 - 1388.76] P:1809.99 E:0.095893 |  The three of us, oh, four of us were game, sorry, we're all doing the semi-final in MENIUM.
[1388.76 - 1390.76] P:1811.97 E:0.095818 |  I thought Dembele did have a better go with it.
[1390.76 - 1395.76] P:1745.83 E:0.099217 |  I just can remind you that, I thought Dembele had the better of Cucarrea.
[1395.76 - 1400.76] P:1876.07 E:0.105137 |  And you're right to look at that as an area which England will certainly target.
[1400.76 - 1402.76] P:1837.01 E:0.091068 |  You know, Saka such a wonderful dribbler.
[1402.76 - 1405.76] P:1901.91 E:0.096122 |  The Spanish team don't have too many weaknesses.
[1405.76 - 1410.76] P:1886.87 E:0.106651 |  I mean, you watch them throughout the tournament, they've scored the most goals, they've conceded the least amount of goals.
[1410.76 - 1413.76] P:1956.32 E:0.094926 |  They play with a wonderful symmetry.
[1413.76 - 1420.76] P:1899.63 E:0.103587 |  They're a beautifully balanced team where England are a bit lopsided, a bit eschewed if you like.
[1420.76 - 1427.76] P:1823.74 E:0.093384 |  But it's about finding a way, but performance-wise, it's about whether Spain can really go again
[1427.76 - 1432.76] P:1779.22 E:0.100530 |  and maintain that high level of performance which they have all the way through the tournament,
[1432.76 - 1436.76] P:1842.06 E:0.095571 |  maybe other than a 25-minute spell against Germany.
[1436.76 - 1438.76] P:1762.03 E:0.082979 |  But that aside, they're going to take some beating.
[1438.76 - 1441.76] P:1691.35 E:0.087812 |  OK, I'll share one little story I heard.
[1441.76 - 1446.76] P:1766.27 E:0.089305 |  We can say it now because you don't have access to Gareth Southgate or anybody of the coaching staff of England.
[1446.76 - 1452.76] P:1898.31 E:0.081860 |  The first 10-15 minutes, it is taking every single game time to adjust.
[1452.76 - 1458.76] P:1795.04 E:0.096202 |  Adjust the pressure high, for instance, England decides to build in a different way, that is not prepared, you have to adjust.
[1458.76 - 1463.76] P:1835.43 E:0.089870 |  That is the time because we'll go at you, we'll try to hang you, get the ball early.
[1463.76 - 1467.76] P:1856.33 E:0.085912 |  If you beat that, there's a lot of space, France did that very, very well.
[1467.76 - 1472.76] P:1842.43 E:0.095870 |  At three counters, in one of them they scored, the other two could have been 2-0 and then the game over.
[1472.76 - 1474.76] P:1847.72 E:0.092312 |  So you're very, very good at the counter.
[1474.76 - 1481.76] P:1856.36 E:0.096438 |  Those 10-15 minutes are going to be crucial, but the manager has the team to do is not to risk a lot.
[1481.76 - 1483.76] P:1902.45 E:0.075243 |  If you're not clear, track back.
[1483.76 - 1489.76] P:1916.03 E:0.100731 |  Do you not think in the game against France that Williams in particular was very good at helping out Cooke-Area?
[1489.76 - 1493.76] P:2000.94 E:0.088884 |  The reason I highlighted Mussiallo against Germany is that Germany were getting around the back of Spain.
[1493.76 - 1498.76] P:1983.55 E:0.095108 |  France by and large, Mussiallo was cutting inside, wasn't he?
[1498.76 - 1502.76] P:1845.68 E:0.082218 |  They weren't getting around the back of Cooke-Area because Williams came back to help out.
[1502.76 - 1510.76] P:1843.91 E:0.097501 |  You insist on the idea of Cooke-Area's weakness, but let me tell you that, Brodery for instance, Danny Olmo,
[1510.76 - 1516.76] P:1766.80 E:0.095285 |  players that perhaps didn't know Cooke-Area so well, they are surprised about him and not so much going forward
[1516.76 - 1519.76] P:1858.51 E:0.092536 |  because he doesn't do it that often with Nico Williams doing the weak.
[1519.76 - 1524.76] P:1949.83 E:0.087444 |  It's with the pro-activitness, if that's a word, of his defence.
[1524.76 - 1532.76] P:1870.00 E:0.093004 |  When somebody like Dembélé comes at him, he doesn't step back, he just goes forward and goes to the clash, doesn't let players turn.
[1532.76 - 1536.76] P:1841.49 E:0.088459 |  He does a lot of very good technical defensive movements.
[1537.76 - 1538.76] P:1814.50 E:0.110269 |  So that's my defence.
[1538.76 - 1546.76] P:1810.64 E:0.099635 |  And also, within that, Matt, because of the position that you played, it's how La Pau helps him out on that side.
[1546.76 - 1549.76] P:1795.24 E:0.099162 |  It's what one of the midfielders in front of him does to help out on that side.
[1549.76 - 1557.76] P:1804.90 E:0.093545 |  Absolutely. It's Ruiz, it's La Pau who again brings a lovely balance to a team, he's got that lovely left foot stepping out of defence.
[1557.76 - 1565.76] P:1754.39 E:0.095925 |  I agree with Chris, for me the major difference between Spain and England, they've found this lovely balance in the team.
[1565.76 - 1569.76] P:1803.54 E:0.102558 |  I love the fact that your mouth has got that beautiful left foot on the right-hand side,
[1569.76 - 1572.76] P:1914.62 E:0.100026 |  Cucarilla gets up wide, stretches the pitch, Williams come in inside.
[1572.76 - 1579.76] P:1884.33 E:0.100240 |  You've got little triangles and movement and angled passes all over the pitch and the ability to counterattack.
[1579.76 - 1584.76] P:1817.00 E:0.091144 |  They're not as obsessed with possession as what that Spanish philosophy used to be.
[1584.76 - 1589.76] P:1751.72 E:0.103940 |  So they will sucker punch you, they will move the ball forward quickly, they're not afraid to be direct.
[1589.76 - 1597.76] P:1869.95 E:0.089688 |  I don't think we should press too high, I think the capabilities for Spain to play through us could kill us, so maybe sit off.
[1597.76 - 1600.76] P:1812.86 E:0.107169 |  Is the other thing in this discussion easy as well?
[1600.76 - 1607.76] P:1815.67 E:0.092837 |  What Bacchio Sacken might have to consider from his defensive duties if he is nominally a wingback?
[1609.76 - 1617.76] P:1777.55 E:0.098981 |  So far this tournament, Bacchio Sacken, in fact, Arsenal, week in week out in the Premier League, we see he's got such good defensive instincts,
[1617.76 - 1622.76] P:1755.61 E:0.103514 |  he's got a really good understanding of which position to be in when he's in a defending action,
[1622.76 - 1628.76] P:1739.79 E:0.103664 |  when the ball comes from the other side, he's really well placed, most of the time to pick up a second ball,
[1628.76 - 1635.76] P:1863.10 E:0.101587 |  and he's so good at retaining the ball, whatever he is on the pitch, he draws in fouls and releases defensive pressure.
[1635.76 - 1642.76] P:1918.21 E:0.107521 |  And I just think that that's going to be a big, big ask for Bacchio Sacken tonight, but has he done it before? Absolutely.
[1642.76 - 1653.76] P:1880.21 E:0.116604 |  The cheers that you can hear at the moment are from the England fans, because they are coming out to just take in their surroundings.
[1653.76 - 1664.76] P:1863.98 E:0.107904 |  Declan Rice has just given his Arsenal teammate David Ryre a huge shake in the hands and a huge hug as well as he comes out onto the pitch.
[1664.76 - 1672.76] P:1822.40 E:0.108195 |  And David Ryre has now just done the same with Ivan Tony as well, because he was at Brentford, was Ryre before moving on to Arsenal.
[1672.76 - 1680.76] P:1830.40 E:0.098884 |  And now Spain just being beckoned in, they've just been beckoned to go in, as England have come out.
[1680.76 - 1684.76] P:1694.46 E:0.093845 |  John Murray has got his binoculars out, what are you looking at?
[1685.76 - 1693.76] P:1857.27 E:0.107347 |  I was just having a general look to see what the mood was, so I was looking to see what the interaction was between Ivan Tony and David Ryre.
[1693.76 - 1696.76] P:1879.74 E:0.099578 |  And they're still talking to one another off the field.
[1696.76 - 1704.76] P:1862.28 E:0.102179 |  And actually one little insight from the dressing room the other night after the semifinal was Louis Dunk and Bart McBruggan in the dressing room together,
[1704.76 - 1710.76] P:1889.10 E:0.102504 |  in the area outside the dressing rooms, had a long, long, long chat together, the two of them,
[1710.76 - 1717.76] P:1739.69 E:0.105693 |  which I thought was the sort of thing you only see when you're down there in that area to see two professionals who are on the other side of the coin, but clubmates.
[1717.76 - 1721.76] P:1828.99 E:0.100095 |  And it was just really interesting to see.
[1721.76 - 1729.76] P:1796.41 E:0.104200 |  I do think that one of the nice things actually, Izzy, about this England team and this England squad,
[1729.76 - 1732.76] P:1829.57 E:0.097251 |  is its variety of club connections.
[1732.76 - 1735.76] P:1722.34 E:0.102065 |  I mean, there's a lot been spoken about Crystal Palace.
[1735.76 - 1744.76] P:1761.12 E:0.105045 |  I read an article this week, I was saying yesterday about how they should thank Brentford for Ivan Tony and Oli Watkins and Esra Conza,
[1744.76 - 1749.76] P:1824.98 E:0.106855 |  who've all had bit roles to play at some point or other in this tournament.
[1749.76 - 1756.76] P:1890.06 E:0.093762 |  This is not a squad just drawn from the top three, four, five?
[1756.76 - 1758.76] P:1916.27 E:0.098318 |  No, and it's wonderful to see.
[1758.76 - 1766.76] P:1847.00 E:0.103412 |  And when the England squad was announced, there was a lot of emphasis on Crystal Palace because of the number of players within this squad.
[1766.76 - 1772.76] P:1856.71 E:0.098674 |  And from the outside, looking into the squad, you can really feel and see the camaraderie amongst the players.
[1772.76 - 1781.76] P:1806.58 E:0.099429 |  And I think that bringing that club mentality into an England shirt has been one of the key factors in reshaping the look and the culture of this England team.
[1781.76 - 1789.76] P:1818.81 E:0.099424 |  And I see no surprise that how this England team are performing and what Gareth Southgate's done, which I know we're going to come on to later,
[1789.76 - 1795.76] P:1798.68 E:0.092804 |  but it is that kind of ease of a club mentality, familiarity every day in and around the squads.
[1795.76 - 1804.76] P:1787.89 E:0.098166 |  And you can just see that, you know, it's not a surprise that England are doing well when the players seem to be enjoying each other's company.
[1804.76 - 1810.76] P:1801.22 E:0.110158 |  And another big interaction between Jude Dalligan and Danny Carverhaal.
[1810.76 - 1817.76] P:1794.23 E:0.112987 |  They met Gheam over the half-way line and they actually, I mean, it was a proper embrace.
[1817.76 - 1821.76] P:1805.47 E:0.111274 |  And Hosello as well, obviously all Real Madrid players.
[1821.76 - 1826.76] P:1865.99 E:0.099252 |  I was just going to say that because this, I think, this is the game of our times.
[1826.76 - 1829.76] P:1885.04 E:0.106747 |  These are the two best leagues in the world.
[1829.76 - 1834.76] P:1894.34 E:0.095501 |  These are some players that play together and they've got a lot of respect for each other.
[1834.76 - 1839.76] P:1907.15 E:0.087843 |  Some of which have met, for instance, in the 17s World Cup final.
[1839.76 - 1848.76] P:1950.64 E:0.097389 |  Influence mutually because you take in our coaches and players, but we take the way you run the business and the physicality of football.
[1848.76 - 1855.76] P:1825.67 E:0.099216 |  You've got basically a manager that has openly admitted that two of his references are Pebo de Lola and Pochadino,
[1855.76 - 1863.76] P:1847.04 E:0.094557 |  obviously of his Spanish influence, and just generally the best we can get right now in football, isn't it?
[1863.76 - 1870.76] P:1829.59 E:0.099063 |  Yeah, I mean, these are the guys, aren't they? Carverhaal and Natro Fernandez and Hosello and Bellingham,
[1870.76 - 1877.76] P:1910.91 E:0.099922 |  who just a few weeks ago experienced one of the great things that you can go through as a footballer,
[1877.76 - 1880.76] P:1808.77 E:0.108555 |  to win the Champions League, the 15th Champions League for Real Madrid together,
[1880.76 - 1884.76] P:1788.29 E:0.108124 |  and now here they are tonight on a pausing side to the match of similar magnitude.
[1884.76 - 1890.76] P:1832.36 E:0.110586 |  To feel like his game has explained that so beautifully, it is a final for our times, isn't it?
[1890.76 - 1895.76] P:1825.67 E:0.105516 |  Yeah, absolutely, and the players, and I think also you've got to take into mind they've been away a long time.
[1895.76 - 1902.76] P:1884.87 E:0.108129 |  It's the end of a long journey. It's going to be an emotional moment to see them for a lot of these players
[1902.76 - 1905.76] P:1789.19 E:0.110475 |  and certainly seeing each other beforehand, seeing their teammates.
[1905.76 - 1910.76] P:1805.51 E:0.116523 |  It's probably a bit of comfort in that as well, Chappers, that you see your teammates that you're used to seeing day in, day out.
[1910.76 - 1914.76] P:1739.91 E:0.109519 |  Spain's still out there, England coming back in.
[1914.76 - 1920.76] P:1691.45 E:0.110532 |  Presumably Carverhaal will be giving Bellingham a hug about three minutes in once he's just clattered him, will he?
[1920.76 - 1922.76] P:1799.58 E:0.118803 |  Clattered them, is the right word for him, yes?
[1922.76 - 1928.76] P:1747.49 E:0.119261 |  Let's hear from Karl Walker, shall we? He's sent to win his 90th cap this evening.
[1928.76 - 1932.76] P:1850.68 E:0.097138 |  He's been talking to Steve Crossman about his time in an England shirt.
[1932.76 - 1936.76] P:1595.88 E:0.079796 |  He's been sunriding, he's been sunriding, I can tell you that.
[1936.76 - 1945.76] P:1672.29 E:0.064884 |  From getting my first cap under Capello to my 90th cap in a European championship final, it's something special.
[1945.76 - 1950.76] P:1732.19 E:0.079820 |  Obviously I did spend probably 18 months to two years out of the team as well.
[1950.76 - 1955.76] P:1772.62 E:0.060653 |  Comeback, first game against Icelanders, my 49th cap gets sent off.
[1955.76 - 1961.76] P:1596.33 E:0.079841 |  But I think these things that you have to go through in a process, I don't think, as I said before,
[1961.76 - 1967.76] P:1666.60 E:0.083718 |  in a Manchester City shirt that we got to the final in Porto against Chelsea, lost that and then we go and win it in Istanbul.
[1967.76 - 1973.76] P:1569.06 E:0.072226 |  So hopefully we can follow in the footsteps as I've done at the club where we've got to a final and we've got close.
[1973.76 - 1982.76] P:1668.10 E:0.071553 |  And then this time we go that one step further, but I feel that we're finding the right groove at the right time and that's what's key in tournaments.
[1982.76 - 1986.76] P:1797.02 E:0.076877 |  So even years apart, can losing a final then help you win a final?
[1986.76 - 1995.76] P:1566.45 E:0.068239 |  I think so. I think you have been there before, you've experienced that walkout, walking past the trophy and you've experienced the emotion.
[1995.76 - 2006.76] P:1751.40 E:0.057465 |  We're on a different turf now, maybe that might work in our benefit where there's not so much pressure on us, but people, you know, players,
[2006.76 - 2009.76] P:1762.12 E:0.074031 |  we have to deliver on big occasions that have experienced these finals before.
[2009.76 - 2015.76] P:1617.87 E:0.080082 |  So when you're coming out of that tunnel, for the lads that haven't been there before, would you say to them,
[2015.76 - 2021.76] P:1754.74 E:0.070238 |  maybe don't look at that trophy, maybe don't think about lifting it just yet, maybe just look straight ahead and crack on?
[2021.76 - 2026.76] P:1677.54 E:0.070104 |  I say do whatever works for you. If you want to look at it, if you want to touch it, whatever you want to do,
[2026.76 - 2034.76] P:1525.15 E:0.075938 |  and if that makes you play in the way that you're meant to play and do the job that you're meant to do, so be it, you know, people have different patterns.
[2034.76 - 2037.76] P:1630.66 E:0.073223 |  Some people like to get g'd up before the game, jumping around.
[2037.76 - 2045.76] P:1654.14 E:0.068947 |  Others, I say this with Kevin De Bruyne, he gets changed 10 minutes before the game and he's normally playing Candy Crush.
[2045.76 - 2052.76] P:1773.66 E:0.075590 |  That's what he does. If he works for him, it can work for anyone, so you all have certain routines and I don't think that that should change.
[2052.76 - 2053.76] P:2112.26 E:0.093141 |  It's one game of football.
[2053.76 - 2055.76] P:1428.80 E:0.041001 |  What's your process then?
[2055.76 - 2057.76] P:1851.85 E:0.055535 |  Just chill. Just chill.
[2057.76 - 2059.76] P:1793.77 E:0.070603 |  No Candy Crush.
[2059.76 - 2063.76] P:1604.16 E:0.081519 |  I do actually play Candy Crush while I'm getting a massage to be fair.
[2063.76 - 2068.76] P:1434.54 E:0.064106 |  I listen to my own music. I always make sure that I speak to my mom before the game.
[2068.76 - 2074.76] P:1633.72 E:0.069907 |  That's something that I've done throughout it and she gives me just a little bit of home comfort.
[2074.76 - 2079.76] P:1434.48 E:0.079179 |  Your mom tells you everything that you want to hear, so she calms me down a little bit like that.
[2079.76 - 2087.76] P:1630.67 E:0.063292 |  But I feel that in my career now I've experienced so many highs, but also I've experienced a lot of lows as well.
[2087.76 - 2094.76] P:1348.68 E:0.083785 |  Hopefully people can look at me and lean on me a little bit in tough moments to find a little bit of balance in their head.
[2094.76 - 2097.76] P:1443.71 E:0.071381 |  Does your mom ground you as well in a moment like that?
[2097.76 - 2105.76] P:1759.50 E:0.067487 |  Completely. My mom's been my rock. She's been the one person that's stuck behind me through thick and thin.
[2105.76 - 2108.76] P:1745.22 E:0.087310 |  She was umming and owing. She didn't come to the semi-final because she can't watch.
[2108.76 - 2116.76] P:1814.19 E:0.071537 |  If you see her in the ground, she goes for walks because she hates watching the game, but I managed to persuade her to come to the final.
[2116.76 - 2121.76] P:1488.10 E:0.063693 |  So she will be there. I'll look for her in the crowd and then it's game time then.
[2121.76 - 2125.76] P:1737.99 E:0.088680 |  There are a few of them actually in that Spain team that you played in your first cap.
[2125.76 - 2130.76] P:1681.27 E:0.080609 |  I was looking at some of the names, Busquets, Alonso, Javi, Iniesta, great players come and go.
[2130.76 - 2133.76] P:1685.79 E:0.082110 |  And now of course it's Rodgery who you know just a little bit.
[2133.76 - 2135.76] P:1612.50 E:0.055742 |  Yeah, he's a fantastic player.
[2135.76 - 2142.76] P:1792.98 E:0.066927 |  Obviously what he does on the football field speaks for itself, but I think his dedication to the game,
[2142.76 - 2147.76] P:1527.86 E:0.073895 |  to how he adapts and not being injured for all the games that he plays in,
[2147.76 - 2153.76] P:1795.00 E:0.069447 |  he's a testament to himself and just shows what a great character he is, not just on the field but off the field.
[2153.76 - 2160.76] P:1682.85 E:0.067575 |  So we know what he possesses. You know the Man City boys know that first and foremost what he possesses,
[2160.76 - 2164.76] P:1639.72 E:0.062675 |  but there's also weaknesses in that Spain team that we need to exploit.
[2164.76 - 2165.76] P:1664.17 E:0.048861 |  Such as?
[2165.76 - 2167.76] P:1643.59 E:0.080309 |  We'll keep that to ourselves.
[2167.76 - 2174.76] P:1815.62 E:0.058943 |  Is it hard to take someone who you know well, respect, love, he's been such a big part of that 60 team with you
[2174.76 - 2178.76] P:1799.32 E:0.058409 |  and make them the enemy for a short period of time?
[2178.76 - 2182.76] P:1543.96 E:0.068064 |  Is it hard no? I'm wearing this badge. I represent this country.
[2182.76 - 2188.76] P:1466.01 E:0.062591 |  I played against probably my best friend, that city, Manu Akandji, and his penalty got saved.
[2188.76 - 2190.76] P:1742.30 E:0.056798 |  Did I want him to score?
[2190.76 - 2193.76] P:1528.49 E:0.060493 |  Personally, as Manu and his friendships, of course I did.
[2193.76 - 2197.76] P:1550.69 E:0.063311 |  Was I happy when he missed? More than happy because that gave us the advantage.
[2197.76 - 2201.76] P:1502.22 E:0.076161 |  Just the same with Nathan Ackie, probably the nicest man I've ever met in football,
[2201.76 - 2206.76] P:1395.93 E:0.056854 |  but it's dog eat dog and we're both representing our countries proudly.
[2206.76 - 2211.76] P:1576.84 E:0.066165 |  So come the end of it, you know, whoever wins between Spain and England,
[2211.76 - 2219.76] P:1591.01 E:0.065472 |  I'll have the respect for Rotary as a teammate to go and shake the hands and we move on and we move on from that.
[2219.76 - 2224.76] P:1580.88 E:0.076452 |  I want to ask you about John Stones as well. Again, obviously someone you know like the back of your hand for so many years.
[2224.76 - 2231.76] P:1865.26 E:0.075935 |  When you're playing with him as one of three centre backs, do you get a different experience of John Stones
[2231.76 - 2235.76] P:1633.88 E:0.060803 |  and what is he like to play with in that position?
[2235.76 - 2243.76] P:1617.84 E:0.062806 |  No, John's class. I think he's shown that for a number of years and I think people probably wrote him off a couple of years ago
[2243.76 - 2251.76] P:1652.94 E:0.072215 |  and he's got his head down. He's dedicated, you know, his full life to the game and yesterday everyone's chilling.
[2251.76 - 2260.76] P:1627.47 E:0.076059 |  He's on his bike riding to the gym doing his gym work and making sure he puts in that extra yard to become the best player that he can be.
[2260.76 - 2264.76] P:1583.67 E:0.060788 |  Playing as a three, not much different to City because that's how we build up.
[2264.76 - 2269.76] P:1561.48 E:0.071150 |  Normally he's floating around, running here, there and everywhere, six, eight, ten,
[2269.76 - 2276.76] P:1618.04 E:0.069352 |  popping up on the wing but to have someone next to me that I know, that I'm comfortable with, that I know his strengths,
[2276.76 - 2284.76] P:1539.99 E:0.064542 |  I know his weaknesses, I know what he likes to do. Obviously it's a massive plus but I feel for everyone in the team.
[2284.76 - 2291.76] P:1645.06 E:0.073288 |  We've played together now for a number of years so we know each other's games and how we like to receive the ball and stuff like that.
[2291.76 - 2298.76] P:1587.21 E:0.063022 |  So it has to come together and the best thing about this is one game of football, that anything can happen.
[2298.76 - 2303.76] P:1685.45 E:0.056390 |  And lastly, how much would it mean to do it for Garra Southgate as well?
[2303.76 - 2313.76] P:1702.95 E:0.052514 |  That's probably at the top of the list. We do it for the group of people that have been here that have sacrificed six weeks
[2313.76 - 2321.76] P:1627.21 E:0.060382 |  and that's not just a place because it's an honour to play for the country but for the media, the medics, the chefs, the nutritionists.
[2321.76 - 2330.76] P:1693.02 E:0.061377 |  They've all put their summer into this and you can see with the celebrations when we went and scored and all they scored that goal,
[2330.76 - 2337.76] P:1697.34 E:0.061695 |  just how much it means to everyone, not just because we're in a final but because of what we've had to come through.
[2337.76 - 2343.76] P:1443.95 E:0.079207 |  I speak about the media but the media have wrote us off, said we've not done this, we've not done that.
[2343.76 - 2350.76] P:1581.61 E:0.075644 |  I've seen certain quotes from certain players saying we haven't got the heart and we just rely on certain individuals
[2350.76 - 2359.76] P:1651.86 E:0.071441 |  and that gives us fuel because we're not individuals, we're a team and we all work for each other and complement each other in the best way that we can.
[2359.76 - 2370.76] P:1609.35 E:0.069991 |  So coming back to what you say, it's not just for the set of lads, a group of people that are here, it's for Garra, the fans and everyone associated with this country.
[2370.76 - 2376.76] P:1827.81 E:0.099523 |  Karl Walker with Steve Crossman, so many different things you could pick out of that, Chris Sutter.
[2376.76 - 2385.76] P:1860.43 E:0.092623 |  I just want to start about, he was effusive in his praise of John Stones of course and Walker, Stones, Pickford and Rice
[2385.76 - 2396.76] P:1752.08 E:0.095815 |  and the four who have played every minute of the tournament so far, which is kind of either the spine or in Walker's sense the vice captain,
[2396.76 - 2398.76] P:1704.57 E:0.098010 |  the leader when Kane isn't on there.
[2398.76 - 2402.76] P:1740.27 E:0.106099 |  Yep, absolutely, I think they're all decent leaders.
[2402.76 - 2414.76] P:1714.81 E:0.103758 |  You think about Karl Walker and what a great servant he's been to England, he'll get a big test tonight against Nico Williams when he is dragged into that wide area
[2414.76 - 2419.76] P:1724.49 E:0.096941 |  whether he's right back or England are a bit of a hybrid team, he's right side and the half.
[2419.76 - 2427.76] P:1774.85 E:0.100037 |  But he's been a phenomenal player for England and when you think his England career, he's had the competition from Trent Alexander-Arnold in that.
[2427.76 - 2435.76] P:1850.02 E:0.101964 |  In that right back position, Kieran Trippier, but he's always been a constant under Garra, there's that trust that he's going to go out and perform
[2435.76 - 2443.76] P:1840.84 E:0.097970 |  and he has done in this tournament, he's been one of England's best performers, but he's going to have to perform at another level this evening.
[2443.76 - 2453.76] P:1836.35 E:0.101432 |  If you can keep combinations from club level at international level, particularly defensively actually, you've got an advantage, haven't you?
[2453.76 - 2462.76] P:1850.59 E:0.100081 |  It has to be an advantage for sure, just listening to Karl Walker talk there about how he understands John Stones, what he likes to do, what he doesn't like to do,
[2462.76 - 2469.76] P:1849.44 E:0.101077 |  he'll anticipate certain moves that he knows he's going to step in or try and do something and he'll adjust his position accordingly
[2469.76 - 2476.76] P:1833.63 E:0.098690 |  and that's really small tweets, but this is the type of game where those small things make a big, big difference.
[2476.76 - 2484.76] P:1805.25 E:0.102547 |  Let's face it, defensively, was the area coming into this tournament where we were all really fearful about and talk about how the centre-back problem
[2484.76 - 2490.76] P:1879.82 E:0.098389 |  and it's ended up being a real strength and the foundation of how England have got to this final.
[2490.76 - 2498.76] P:1861.73 E:0.104664 |  Karl Walker was actually put up by the FA just a few moments ago to do the TV Pipside interview for BBC TV.
[2498.76 - 2505.76] P:1896.02 E:0.096153 |  I think it's quite interesting who gets picked to do these pre-match injuries, particularly before a final.
[2505.76 - 2512.76] P:1765.84 E:0.104666 |  Spain, Guillem Balague, have gone with Marco Cugarela, presumably to put Ian Dennis' criticism to him ahead of this tournament.
[2512.76 - 2516.76] P:1849.23 E:0.100908 |  Yeah, you look around and who is people doubting, put Cugarela in.
[2516.76 - 2523.76] P:1842.48 E:0.090651 |  Is one of those players that will absolutely say nothing? I think that's what he's in.
[2523.76 - 2529.76] P:1925.24 E:0.093563 |  The other thing in all of that, in view of Karl Walker, was his description of Rodri,
[2529.76 - 2539.76] P:1984.29 E:0.095632 |  I'm talking about Rodri as a teammate, Rodri as an opponent. He is the most important player for Spain tonight, isn't he?
[2539.76 - 2545.76] P:1874.52 E:0.098647 |  No doubt. You can have the ones that will take the headlines, but I think, as in, you know,
[2545.76 - 2552.76] P:1897.22 E:0.092479 |  somebody scores a fantastic goal, we'll be talking about him, but Rodri, if Spain wins, will be the player of the tournament.
[2552.76 - 2556.76] P:1801.33 E:0.092485 |  That's what I think the technical guys of UEFA think enough.
[2556.76 - 2563.76] P:1862.10 E:0.097676 |  But what I find fascinating, and I'm not sure I've got the explanation for it, everybody knows what Rodri does.
[2563.76 - 2568.76] P:1868.73 E:0.103785 |  This is a new thing, because Sergio Bousquez has been doing it for 15 years, and he wasn't never in the individual awards,
[2568.76 - 2572.76] P:1835.43 E:0.091173 |  he wasn't talked about as a genius or a great player, but Rodri has.
[2572.76 - 2580.76] P:1801.69 E:0.093721 |  I think the Wanda 1580 kind of helps his course greatly, and that he's a Manchester City as well,
[2580.76 - 2583.76] P:1739.43 E:0.093607 |  but he has been winning, and the managers have been talking about it.
[2583.76 - 2586.76] P:1959.14 E:0.091309 |  I'm not sure if people know what he does, but yeah, he's crucial.
[2586.76 - 2593.76] P:1875.61 E:0.084899 |  Can you, can you, is he, negate Rodri's effect on a team?
[2593.76 - 2599.76] P:1807.29 E:0.087570 |  I shouldn't have last night, didn't we, Guillaume and Matt, about, you know, you have a decision to make.
[2599.76 - 2605.76] P:1743.46 E:0.100506 |  Do you put a player on him and say, stay with him for the whole game, wherever he goes, you stay with him.
[2605.76 - 2610.76] P:1857.18 E:0.103824 |  But if you do that, you lose a player in your own structure, in your press.
[2610.76 - 2612.76] P:1876.63 E:0.102556 |  In my opinion, you don't need to do that.
[2612.76 - 2616.76] P:1789.43 E:0.100853 |  I touched on it last night on Five Live about space being an issue, not necessarily people.
[2616.76 - 2622.76] P:1847.93 E:0.088470 |  Of course, we know how effective Rodri is on the ball, but he's effective when he gets the ball from deep,
[2622.76 - 2629.76] P:1895.50 E:0.092151 |  so it's which spaces England are going to nullify, which spaces are England going to allow Spain to play in,
[2629.76 - 2633.76] P:1795.78 E:0.102090 |  and Matt was touching on this earlier about if England press high, we're in trouble.
[2633.76 - 2640.76] P:1821.34 E:0.098627 |  And I think that we can't be frustrated if England do actually drop, because if we drop off and be a little,
[2640.76 - 2644.76] P:1722.65 E:0.101338 |  I'm not saying deep, I'm saying sort of middle, middle area of the pitch, we need to be compact.
[2644.76 - 2652.76] P:1817.49 E:0.099943 |  By doing that, we might actually help to stop Rodri doing what he's best at, which is passing the ball through the lines.
[2652.76 - 2657.76] P:1903.00 E:0.092127 |  And I'm saying that as the sprinklers are on the pitch here, the ball is going to be fizzing around.
[2657.76 - 2662.76] P:1804.37 E:0.095179 |  And when Rodri gets on the ball with space and time, he can pass through the lines and he can be the catalyst
[2662.76 - 2667.76] P:1800.82 E:0.103016 |  to get Spain on the attack. So we do have to think firmly how we are going to stop him doing that,
[2667.76 - 2670.76] P:1788.91 E:0.092525 |  and I think space is the biggest issue, we've got to close the gaps.
[2670.76 - 2678.76] P:1821.63 E:0.097284 |  Also, I feel that if you stop Rodri, we've got that brand of player on the pitch that can help the organisation,
[2678.76 - 2684.76] P:1835.06 E:0.091363 |  be Laporte coming from deep, or Dani Almot dropping deep, or Fabian Ruiz as well.
[2684.76 - 2690.76] P:1803.63 E:0.085702 |  And it is in contrast perhaps the type of player that England don't have that often,
[2690.76 - 2696.76] P:1887.50 E:0.093889 |  you've got to play a 19-year-old there, but go and try to stop Rodri, because others will step in for him, I feel.
[2696.76 - 2698.76] P:1947.10 E:0.109814 |  I was going to say Germany tried it, didn't they, with Gunda 1.
[2698.76 - 2702.76] P:1986.30 E:0.097871 |  And then as soon as Spain took the lead, the Germany game plan changed.
[2702.76 - 2707.76] P:1936.62 E:0.103271 |  It was almost as if they were trying to contain Spain, and then visibly you saw them change straight away,
[2707.76 - 2709.76] P:1941.78 E:0.092640 |  and then they were going on the attack.
[2709.76 - 2713.76] P:1851.51 E:0.095803 |  John asked Garra Southgate last night, do you have a plan for Rodri?
[2713.76 - 2715.76] P:1806.64 E:0.104549 |  It'll be interesting to see what England do.
[2715.76 - 2718.76] P:1914.95 E:0.097824 |  Do they adopt what Germany did and try and put somebody on him,
[2718.76 - 2722.76] P:1929.30 E:0.100282 |  or do they just leave him and then maybe go on the attack themselves?
[2722.76 - 2726.76] P:1844.48 E:0.095104 |  But if we're in that kind of more hybrid formation that Chris mentioned earlier,
[2726.76 - 2730.76] P:1836.56 E:0.097286 |  you're going to have Bellingham and Foden relatively central.
[2730.76 - 2733.76] P:1777.53 E:0.104266 |  If we've slaughtered into that five, they're going to be more central,
[2733.76 - 2736.76] P:1748.76 E:0.095020 |  they're going to be right in that vicinity of Rodri and Fabian,
[2736.76 - 2741.76] P:1764.55 E:0.099582 |  and it'd be interesting to see whether there is a little bit of an out-of-possession kind of game plan to say,
[2741.76 - 2744.76] P:1800.29 E:0.106947 |  right, you two, it's going to be quite an even match-up in there.
[2744.76 - 2747.76] P:1818.51 E:0.101810 |  Can you go and stop the engine room of what Spain have?
[2747.76 - 2750.76] P:1819.33 E:0.106899 |  Can we limit the amount of time? You can't stop it,
[2750.76 - 2754.76] P:1873.51 E:0.104063 |  but can you limit the impact that Rodri can have on the game?
[2754.76 - 2758.76] P:1979.08 E:0.101055 |  When you talk about out-of-possession, that's where Spain have actually been equally impressive.
[2758.76 - 2762.76] P:1914.44 E:0.100916 |  They've been impressive with the ball, but they've been impressive without it.
[2762.76 - 2764.76] P:1958.46 E:0.094796 |  We've seen Spain throughout this tournament.
[2764.76 - 2767.76] P:1958.97 E:0.097171 |  At times, teams press them high.
[2767.76 - 2771.76] P:1817.62 E:0.104901 |  You can try to stop Rodri, you've got Fabian Ruiz.
[2771.76 - 2773.76] P:1833.04 E:0.082346 |  Kukare has come through on the ball.
[2773.76 - 2777.76] P:1841.55 E:0.101978 |  Danny, the other side, they pop the ball into the wide areas.
[2777.76 - 2782.76] P:1878.92 E:0.095489 |  Their patterns of play, they are the most organised team.
[2782.76 - 2784.76] P:1828.51 E:0.102910 |  They are telepathic, the Spanish in the way.
[2784.76 - 2786.76] P:1880.72 E:0.109941 |  I'm low in this build-up.
[2786.76 - 2788.76] P:1861.34 E:0.101450 |  But they are, and they have been.
[2788.76 - 2791.76] P:1826.10 E:0.109567 |  They have a marvellous understanding of the wide players,
[2791.76 - 2794.76] P:1887.69 E:0.101514 |  but ones who were so young.
[2794.76 - 2797.76] P:1880.38 E:0.104097 |  If there's space in behind, they'll make that movement in behind,
[2797.76 - 2799.76] P:1777.17 E:0.109645 |  they'll threaten in behind, and when that's not on,
[2799.76 - 2802.76] P:1772.00 E:0.106369 |  they'll come into the little pocket, so it's all right saying,
[2802.76 - 2805.76] P:1837.66 E:0.104651 |  well, we'll go man-to-man with Rodri, man-to-man with Ruiz,
[2805.76 - 2807.76] P:1886.85 E:0.121660 |  but there's always an out.
[2807.76 - 2810.76] P:1904.49 E:0.090171 |  I think that they like teams who press them high,
[2810.76 - 2813.76] P:1742.03 E:0.096307 |  because they are that accomplished, they are that well-balanced,
[2813.76 - 2817.76] P:1860.82 E:0.084679 |  that I've not seen too many teams take the ball off them high up the pitch.
[2817.76 - 2822.76] P:1851.98 E:0.094006 |  Switch back to England. The team news is in, John.
[2822.76 - 2826.76] P:1910.46 E:0.093999 |  The news is, first start of the tournament for Luke Shaw,
[2826.76 - 2830.76] P:1810.04 E:0.093569 |  who turned 29 on Friday with Kieran Trippier out of the side
[2830.76 - 2832.76] P:1853.39 E:0.093981 |  for the first time here.
[2832.76 - 2835.76] P:1808.45 E:0.095775 |  There was a groin issue for him on Wednesday.
[2835.76 - 2839.76] P:1731.12 E:0.098887 |  I see one or two reports suggesting that he might have been unwell,
[2839.76 - 2842.76] P:1833.00 E:0.097237 |  Kieran Trippier, but I'm sure we'll find out about that
[2842.76 - 2844.76] P:1753.77 E:0.101693 |  when we hear from Gareth Southgate.
[2844.76 - 2846.76] P:1875.15 E:0.095354 |  That's it, just the one change.
[2846.76 - 2849.76] P:1748.32 E:0.102943 |  The names of the men who hope to write themselves
[2849.76 - 2853.76] P:1855.02 E:0.096444 |  into English football history are Pickford, Walker, Stones and Gay,
[2853.76 - 2859.76] P:1753.58 E:0.094690 |  Saka, Menu, Rice and Shaw, Thornton, Bellingham and Kane.
[2859.76 - 2861.76] P:1748.07 E:0.099163 |  So with Luke Shaw coming in, Mark,
[2861.76 - 2865.76] P:1845.65 E:0.095185 |  we're talking about his first competitive start for almost five months now,
[2865.76 - 2868.76] P:1777.16 E:0.096523 |  having come on as a substitute in the last two rounds.
[2868.76 - 2871.76] P:1791.85 E:0.104017 |  And this, remember, is the man who scored in the second minute
[2871.76 - 2873.76] P:1836.88 E:0.095800 |  of the last European Championship final.
[2873.76 - 2876.76] P:1760.49 E:0.100224 |  But other than that, it's the same players,
[2876.76 - 2878.76] P:1791.07 E:0.092341 |  the other 10 players who started against the Dutch.
[2878.76 - 2882.76] P:1858.29 E:0.093441 |  So that means eight of this team will have started all seven of the matches.
[2882.76 - 2886.76] P:1828.53 E:0.094428 |  And actually, six of this team started that final
[2886.76 - 2889.76] P:1851.79 E:0.093044 |  against Italy three years ago at Wembley.
[2889.76 - 2893.76] P:1848.68 E:0.103067 |  And if he plays his part tonight and it is successful,
[2893.76 - 2896.76] P:1831.59 E:0.104272 |  then Mattox and Luke Shaw's time that run to perfection.
[2896.76 - 2898.76] P:1743.42 E:0.095549 |  He has, isn't he? Right on cue.
[2898.76 - 2900.76] P:1923.37 E:0.089427 |  Just fit enough for the final.
[2900.76 - 2902.76] P:1868.83 E:0.091688 |  Not bad timing from Luke Shaw, is it?
[2902.76 - 2907.76] P:1839.17 E:0.095562 |  But he's actually looked better than what I thought he was going to...
[2907.76 - 2911.76] P:1733.67 E:0.101068 |  be in the moments where he's come on off the bench.
[2911.76 - 2913.76] P:1821.03 E:0.103247 |  And whether or not there's an injury or an illness
[2913.76 - 2916.76] P:1844.73 E:0.101430 |  that has just kind of forced the issue a little bit,
[2916.76 - 2919.76] P:1747.90 E:0.098343 |  he certainly brings obviously the left footed balance
[2919.76 - 2923.76] P:1888.50 E:0.105104 |  and the ability to deliver a ball first time on the run.
[2923.76 - 2926.76] P:1898.26 E:0.097524 |  There was one moment in the Dutch game where it was crying out for a cross
[2926.76 - 2928.76] P:1800.15 E:0.098056 |  into the box and it just didn't come in.
[2928.76 - 2932.76] P:1914.81 E:0.099693 |  So at least you know this evening, if there is an opportunity to do that,
[2932.76 - 2935.76] P:1876.25 E:0.104373 |  with Bellingham arriving, folding around there, Kane in the box,
[2935.76 - 2937.76] P:1832.82 E:0.099198 |  then that can be a real threat for England.
[2937.76 - 2941.76] P:1841.03 E:0.101358 |  England did tell us yesterday that all 26 players did train,
[2941.76 - 2944.76] P:1805.51 E:0.108142 |  but I can't imagine it would be a very light session yesterday anyway.
[2944.76 - 2947.76] P:1898.07 E:0.101449 |  However, Trippier is named among the substitutes.
[2947.76 - 2952.76] P:1898.32 E:0.104368 |  It's hard not to have an element of sympathy for Kieran Trippier, isn't it?
[2952.76 - 2957.76] P:1785.48 E:0.103702 |  I mean, everybody has cried out for a left footer on the left side.
[2957.76 - 2961.76] P:1748.55 E:0.098194 |  I get that. But he has performed admirably in this tournament.
[2961.76 - 2963.76] P:1785.22 E:0.086360 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[2963.76 - 2966.76] P:1763.15 E:0.086162 |  I mean, it does suggest to me that it, you know,
[2966.76 - 2969.76] P:1850.76 E:0.099493 |  Gareth is a stickler for loyalty,
[2969.76 - 2972.76] P:1800.72 E:0.101111 |  and you know, Gareth is cautious at times with his approach.
[2972.76 - 2978.76] P:1825.18 E:0.104351 |  You know, I suspect there is probably some niggle or illness with Trippier.
[2978.76 - 2981.76] P:1901.43 E:0.105772 |  He's not quite right. I suppose the issue with Luke Shaw,
[2981.76 - 2984.76] P:1920.82 E:0.094612 |  that's right, of course, is going to give England a far better balance
[2984.76 - 2988.76] P:1763.55 E:0.105142 |  down that left-hand side, which they have no doubt missed throughout the tournament.
[2988.76 - 2991.76] P:1869.39 E:0.107234 |  But how long has Luke Shaw gone to last?
[2991.76 - 2993.76] P:1792.95 E:0.106244 |  And that is, you know, that's certainly going to be an issue.
[2993.76 - 2995.76] P:1870.81 E:0.104885 |  It makes you wonder about the shape as well,
[2995.76 - 2997.76] P:1726.83 E:0.100555 |  because I think Gareth is going to have to come out.
[2997.76 - 3000.76] P:1746.33 E:0.105217 |  I mean, you're playing against a player completely fearless,
[3000.76 - 3003.76] P:1790.07 E:0.099273 |  a young player, top of his game, massive threat,
[3003.76 - 3006.76] P:1813.97 E:0.105183 |  his deliveries into the box, crossing-wise is just fantastic.
[3006.76 - 3009.76] P:1824.46 E:0.102574 |  To get him tight to your mouth for Luke Shaw,
[3009.76 - 3011.76] P:1786.78 E:0.101602 |  I mean, that's an interesting one-on-one,
[3011.76 - 3013.76] P:1855.98 E:0.092622 |  and your first start for quite a few months, isn't it?
[3013.76 - 3015.76] P:1800.42 E:0.101842 |  Welcome to the game.
[3015.76 - 3017.76] P:1985.52 E:0.100292 |  Does Shaw on the left-hand side,
[3017.76 - 3021.76] P:1813.13 E:0.083211 |  is he allowed them to sort of shuffle
[3021.76 - 3025.76] P:1771.96 E:0.104230 |  whether they want to be a four or a three on either side?
[3025.76 - 3027.76] P:1768.92 E:0.094258 |  Yeah, quite possibly.
[3027.76 - 3032.76] P:1801.75 E:0.097509 |  I think bringing him in gives England the opportunity,
[3032.76 - 3035.76] P:1770.38 E:0.102836 |  and I have a confession here. I am with Dano on this.
[3035.76 - 3037.76] P:1875.07 E:0.095689 |  I think Kukareya is an issue.
[3037.76 - 3040.76] P:1811.32 E:0.089300 |  I say an issue. He's been fantastic this tournament.
[3040.76 - 3043.76] P:1824.74 E:0.103783 |  Defending the back post, I think, is his weakness,
[3043.76 - 3045.76] P:1786.01 E:0.112374 |  and we're being really, really pinnicky there.
[3045.76 - 3049.76] P:1793.29 E:0.091446 |  But I think Luke Shaw providing that balance for England
[3049.76 - 3053.76] P:1863.71 E:0.098492 |  with the left foot, I think gives England the opportunity
[3053.76 - 3057.76] P:1813.61 E:0.095293 |  to put balls to the back post with a natural left footer
[3057.76 - 3059.76] P:1874.77 E:0.091870 |  and to attack that area of the pitch late
[3059.76 - 3061.76] P:1839.90 E:0.098885 |  with the likes of Bellingham and Kane.
[3061.76 - 3065.76] P:1845.87 E:0.092298 |  I think could be a real strength for England.
[3065.76 - 3068.76] P:1795.72 E:0.098463 |  Can I just say, though, one of the players in Spain
[3068.76 - 3073.76] P:1841.51 E:0.098051 |  that do more long runs, more intensive runs,
[3073.76 - 3077.76] P:1780.85 E:0.095705 |  who is capable to start and stop
[3077.76 - 3079.76] P:1771.32 E:0.098508 |  and move to one side and deal with La Mignamal,
[3079.76 - 3081.76] P:1891.26 E:0.100818 |  who Luke Shaw is going to face.
[3081.76 - 3084.76] P:1859.45 E:0.100997 |  When you just come back from injury, you had not much fit.
[3084.76 - 3087.76] P:1797.36 E:0.103034 |  Isn't it the worst thing to actually having to do those runs?
[3087.76 - 3091.76] P:1792.66 E:0.093663 |  Yeah, it is. It's the biggest test you're going to face,
[3091.76 - 3093.76] P:1760.53 E:0.106817 |  those kind of one-on-one situations.
[3093.76 - 3096.76] P:1889.57 E:0.104666 |  He only needs half a yard to cross the ball.
[3096.76 - 3098.76] P:1850.78 E:0.103088 |  His left foot crosses it into that back post area.
[3098.76 - 3100.76] P:1810.25 E:0.105497 |  It's just fantastic.
[3100.76 - 3103.76] P:1874.88 E:0.095009 |  Sorry, Matt, if you look at the training environment
[3103.76 - 3106.76] P:1865.73 E:0.096277 |  that Luke Shaw has had over the past four to five weeks,
[3106.76 - 3108.76] P:1858.15 E:0.093834 |  coming back to full fitness,
[3108.76 - 3111.76] P:1756.80 E:0.103905 |  and the players that haven't played so much in the England squad,
[3111.76 - 3113.76] P:1848.89 E:0.100894 |  you've got the likes of Ezzah Bowen,
[3113.76 - 3115.76] P:1660.77 E:0.112609 |  who were all unbelievable at dribbling with the ball.
[3115.76 - 3118.76] P:1787.06 E:0.110442 |  I would not have been surprised if there's been a number of occasions
[3118.76 - 3121.76] P:1882.27 E:0.102206 |  during Luke Shaw's rehabilitation and back-to-full fitness journey.
[3121.76 - 3124.76] P:1876.67 E:0.109014 |  The heel have been caught up and tested 1v1
[3124.76 - 3128.76] P:1767.82 E:0.112483 |  against those types of players in sort of specific training drills,
[3128.76 - 3130.76] P:1837.56 E:0.105548 |  which have got him ready.
[3130.76 - 3133.76] P:1734.50 E:0.112627 |  And to be completely honest, there is absolutely no way
[3133.76 - 3135.76] P:1870.42 E:0.103871 |  he would be playing tonight unless he's hit the metrics,
[3135.76 - 3138.76] P:1794.58 E:0.107839 |  he's hit the numbers, and he's also shown us in the last two games,
[3138.76 - 3140.76] P:1754.88 E:0.099576 |  to me, he looks ready.
[3140.76 - 3142.76] P:1790.37 E:0.117616 |  Yeah, I totally agree with Izzy.
[3142.76 - 3147.76] P:1857.26 E:0.117460 |  I don't often agree with Izzy, but he has to be ready now, doesn't he?
[3147.76 - 3151.76] P:1725.17 E:0.100905 |  Because there was a gamble bringing him here,
[3151.76 - 3154.76] P:1782.29 E:0.113021 |  and he's had long enough to get himself fit.
[3154.76 - 3157.76] P:1869.72 E:0.107410 |  Gareth can't take a risk.
[3157.76 - 3160.76] P:1843.59 E:0.109276 |  You can't emulate match-minutes, though, Chris.
[3160.76 - 3163.76] P:1926.66 E:0.113558 |  No, you can't make somebody training as much as you want.
[3163.76 - 3170.76] P:1840.87 E:0.108204 |  I know what you're saying, but he has to be 99.9% sure,
[3170.76 - 3172.76] P:1840.48 E:0.100005 |  because otherwise it isn't worth the risk.
[3172.76 - 3175.76] P:1875.59 E:0.109757 |  He's got to trust him this evening.
[3175.76 - 3179.76] P:1844.04 E:0.099576 |  Gareth must have watched you malplaying the tournament,
[3179.76 - 3182.76] P:1887.38 E:0.104800 |  he knows what he's up against, so there must be that element of trust.
[3182.76 - 3185.76] P:1820.59 E:0.106528 |  I mean, that would be a huge dereliction of duty
[3185.76 - 3188.76] P:1654.99 E:0.114483 |  if he had watched a vinyo malplay at the tournament.
[3188.76 - 3193.76] P:1822.80 E:0.105051 |  Exactly, but everybody knows how damn good he is.
[3193.76 - 3196.76] P:1865.87 E:0.101709 |  So, from Luke Shaw's perspective, to be fair,
[3196.76 - 3199.76] P:1901.13 E:0.111923 |  he's got a brilliant temperament,
[3199.76 - 3202.76] P:1828.83 E:0.104962 |  he doesn't seem like a guy who gets particularly phased,
[3202.76 - 3206.76] P:1826.96 E:0.098768 |  but he could be spinning this evening against you, Mal.
[3206.76 - 3211.76] P:1698.54 E:0.109914 |  You and Izzy have bickered quite a lot over the course.
[3211.76 - 3214.76] P:1841.62 E:0.104707 |  The car journey here was like having a brother and sister.
[3214.76 - 3219.76] P:1752.96 E:0.103380 |  Did you see the retro Spain track seats when they came out to the pitch?
[3219.76 - 3227.76] P:1803.93 E:0.109759 |  Well, yeah, it's funny, sir, because it's all from 1996.
[3227.76 - 3230.76] P:1799.36 E:0.110181 |  And that is it, isn't it, Gareth?
[3230.76 - 3234.76] P:1754.93 E:0.114792 |  Not with Chris's gym gear, which might be actually from 1986,
[3234.76 - 3237.76] P:1907.59 E:0.104408 |  but the Spain is a nod to those Euros.
[3237.76 - 3240.76] P:1881.75 E:0.117267 |  Yeah, we played, we played in the win on the tournament.
[3240.76 - 3243.76] P:1921.41 E:0.102377 |  No, I'm saying because it's the game that you all forgotten.
[3243.76 - 3247.76] P:1922.27 E:0.103940 |  We deserved to beat you that day, with your penalties at the end.
[3247.76 - 3249.76] P:1625.63 E:0.109401 |  It really hurt.
[3249.76 - 3253.76] P:1762.35 E:0.106047 |  And I don't know why we chose that one, because it was not a good tournament.
[3253.76 - 3256.76] P:1741.72 E:0.104432 |  This is Five Live.
[3256.76 - 3260.76] P:1732.72 E:0.109600 |  We are in Berlin, the sun just going behind the cloud.

[3483.76 - 3486.76] P:1143.11 E:0.130091 |  The Spanish players, you could see them enjoying themselves.
[3486.76 - 3488.76] P:1265.84 E:0.098938 |  And trusting each other.
[3488.76 - 3493.76] P:1148.26 E:0.111258 |  For a while there it was rough, but lately I've been doing...
[3493.76 - 3495.76] P:1548.70 E:0.119912 |  Van Gogh is there!
[3495.76 - 3498.76] P:1576.05 E:0.115970 |  With a header in the six-yard box.
[3498.76 - 3501.76] P:1698.19 E:0.116778 |  The Retreaters, the penalty area and scores.

[3504.76 - 3509.76] P:1715.69 E:0.119657 |  Walker pulls it across, double it by Chican, Lefkut in it goes.
[3509.76 - 3511.76] P:1726.09 E:0.117374 |  And England have the lead.
[3511.76 - 3513.76] P:1748.23 E:0.115939 |  Fabian Ruiz looks for shooting opportunity.
[3513.76 - 3515.76] P:1744.47 E:0.118232 |  Just get the shot away and scores.
[3516.76 - 3518.76] P:1568.02 E:0.130622 |  And Spain has scored two quick goals
[3518.76 - 3521.76] P:1583.82 E:0.126242 |  and take a stranglehold of this game here in Berlin.
[3527.76 - 3530.76] P:1829.40 E:0.117781 |  Listen to this reaction from the England supporters.
[3530.76 - 3531.76] P:1830.64 E:0.118596 |  Listen to this.
[3531.76 - 3536.76] P:1729.42 E:0.118757 |  Whistles and cheers and boos all around the stadium here in Frankfurt.
[3536.76 - 3540.76] P:1772.40 E:0.107121 |  That has been a torrid match for Garacel in his team.
[3540.76 - 3544.76] P:1332.67 E:0.093656 |  The most important thing here is that the supporters stay with the team.
[3544.76 - 3546.76] P:1397.23 E:0.112624 |  I'm looking at Garacel, gate on the monitor,
[3546.76 - 3549.76] P:1254.31 E:0.115164 |  hands in his pockets, looking at the floor.
[3550.76 - 3553.76] P:1505.91 E:0.112998 |  I think he feels what's coming, John is not looking good.
[3557.76 - 3559.76] P:1299.51 E:0.111268 |  They're throwing next to the corner flag.
[3560.76 - 3562.76] P:1410.99 E:0.120766 |  Here's the throw, flat to the near post.
[3564.76 - 3565.76] P:1500.79 E:0.112223 |  Flaked on.
[3570.76 - 3572.76] P:1585.32 E:0.129804 |  Oh, it's one-one.
[3572.76 - 3574.76] P:1507.96 E:0.125395 |  It's the man, two-bottom.
[3578.76 - 3579.76] P:1477.56 E:0.136116 |  He saved England.
[3579.76 - 3581.76] P:1400.00 E:0.127910 |  He saved Garacel, gate.
[3585.76 - 3589.76] P:1667.47 E:0.114439 |  I think at this moment in time, all the other countries left in these Euros
[3589.76 - 3593.76] P:1854.30 E:0.109840 |  are looking at this Spanish team thinking they are the team to beat.
[3593.76 - 3594.76] P:1722.60 E:0.121355 |  Moreno with a header.
[3595.76 - 3598.76] P:1710.76 E:0.131189 |  Moreno with a knockout blow, surely.
[3598.76 - 3600.76] P:1335.21 E:0.109903 |  We have a plan, we have an intention.
[3600.76 - 3603.76] P:1599.33 E:0.118665 |  The amount of this left throw goes for Kelly Eppert.
[3603.76 - 3604.76] P:1607.25 E:0.130003 |  Oh, what a super goal.
[3604.76 - 3606.76] P:1684.04 E:0.127109 |  What a super goal.
[3606.76 - 3609.76] P:1501.20 E:0.130521 |  And a crowing moment for the medium now.
[3609.76 - 3614.76] P:1645.74 E:0.128051 |  Oh, it's a big, what a goal for Kiyosaka Vixi.
[3614.76 - 3615.76] P:1544.22 E:0.110284 |  What was?
[3615.76 - 3618.76] P:1525.43 E:0.111816 |  Drags down the corner, puts the ball on the spot.
[3620.76 - 3621.76] P:1573.09 E:0.105226 |  It becomes...
[3622.76 - 3626.76] P:1610.79 E:0.124155 |  And drives it in, and he slipped that through.
[3626.76 - 3627.76] P:1560.16 E:0.110496 |  Pressure.
[3627.76 - 3628.76] P:1372.36 E:0.103579 |  What pressure?
[3628.76 - 3630.76] P:1424.96 E:0.115589 |  Pressure is for tyres.
[3630.76 - 3632.76] P:1485.68 E:0.111051 |  It's a different generation.
[3632.76 - 3633.76] P:1734.45 E:0.112854 |  They don't feel it.
[3633.76 - 3635.76] P:1619.09 E:0.130198 |  Oh, my great opportunity.
[3635.76 - 3636.76] P:1713.60 E:0.127796 |  It's going in.
[3636.76 - 3641.76] P:1549.21 E:0.122243 |  And the team at the tournament soldiered their way to Sunday's final in Berlin.
[3641.76 - 3642.76] P:1887.80 E:0.115515 |  What can...
[3642.76 - 3643.76] P:1785.55 E:0.110228 |  Oh, he scored.
[3643.76 - 3644.76] P:1912.61 E:0.115743 |  What can...
[3644.76 - 3645.76] P:1669.99 E:0.113909 |  What an impossible angle.
[3645.76 - 3648.76] P:1609.44 E:0.105582 |  England are going to Berlin to the final.
[3648.76 - 3653.76] P:1629.43 E:0.107777 |  And for the first time, England will play in a final on foreign soil.
[3654.76 - 3657.76] P:1040.39 E:0.100079 |  These beautiful things that I've got.
[3659.76 - 3663.76] P:1751.44 E:0.106363 |  Just over 50 minutes from kick-off course of the tournament,
[3663.76 - 3667.76] P:1867.84 E:0.110101 |  it has turned out that Ian Dennis has been the voice of Spain,
[3667.76 - 3669.76] P:1876.50 E:0.107551 |  and John Murray, the voice of England,
[3669.76 - 3672.76] P:1814.88 E:0.105967 |  they come together tonight and John has the team news.
[3672.76 - 3675.76] P:1803.62 E:0.109978 |  Yes, at times during that, I wasn't sure I was even going to get here.
[3675.76 - 3678.76] P:1869.76 E:0.113998 |  In all honesty, the stress has been so great.
[3678.76 - 3681.76] P:1793.76 E:0.089615 |  But here we are, happy together, haven't we?
[3681.76 - 3682.76] P:1929.45 E:0.085408 |  Yes.
[3684.76 - 3688.76] P:1856.14 E:0.106169 |  Well, I'm pleased he's picked up something from all of those Spain matches.
[3688.76 - 3691.76] P:1966.72 E:0.113137 |  Right, yeah, the teams tonight, if you haven't heard,
[3691.76 - 3696.76] P:1815.17 E:0.107663 |  Lux Shaw's in, Lux Shaw's in to start on the left-hand side for England.
[3696.76 - 3698.76] P:1797.50 E:0.102487 |  So Kieran Tripp, yeah, on the bench.
[3698.76 - 3700.76] P:1786.92 E:0.110944 |  But the rest of the team pick-for-ing goal,
[3700.76 - 3703.76] P:1817.89 E:0.104063 |  Walker-Stones in game, Saka, Maynou, Rice,
[3703.76 - 3706.76] P:1858.35 E:0.089949 |  then Lux Shaw, Foden, Bellingham and Kane.
[3706.76 - 3708.76] P:1818.09 E:0.099628 |  Incidentally, it's just been pointed out to me.
[3708.76 - 3711.76] P:1913.76 E:0.107397 |  That means that Lux Shaw is the only man in either team
[3711.76 - 3714.76] P:1879.20 E:0.096718 |  to have scored in a major tournament final.
[3714.76 - 3716.76] P:1811.57 E:0.101250 |  Because the Spanish side, a couple of changes.
[3716.76 - 3721.76] P:1821.29 E:0.101947 |  Carvajal and Leno Mande have come back in from suspension for Navas and Nacho.
[3721.76 - 3725.76] P:1846.22 E:0.104911 |  So Simon and Cole, Carvajal, Leno Mande, Le Porte and Cucarrea,
[3725.76 - 3729.76] P:1815.41 E:0.097576 |  Rodri and Ruiz, Yamal, Olmore, Williams and Morata.
[3729.76 - 3732.76] P:1937.28 E:0.109159 |  Petri was out of the tournament with his knee injury in the quarter-final.
[3732.76 - 3734.76] P:1938.89 E:0.101359 |  There's no Ayozou Perez on the bench.
[3734.76 - 3737.76] P:1891.46 E:0.107564 |  He missed the last training session for Spain with a muscle injury,
[3737.76 - 3738.76] P:1908.17 E:0.110094 |  so he's out as well.
[3738.76 - 3740.76] P:1927.21 E:0.101122 |  So they're reduced by two in terms of numbers.
[3740.76 - 3743.76] P:1889.67 E:0.112178 |  Both sets of goalkeeping units are out and warming up here and there,
[3743.76 - 3746.76] P:1883.99 E:0.105964 |  warming up in front of their own fans.
[3746.76 - 3749.76] P:1756.65 E:0.093517 |  I mean, both sets of fans are scattered throughout the stadium,
[3749.76 - 3752.76] P:1777.29 E:0.105042 |  but in with very much have the end to the left.
[3752.76 - 3756.76] P:1891.69 E:0.109243 |  Jordan Pickford and the goalkeepers there are in front of those fans.
[3756.76 - 3759.76] P:1953.39 E:0.102779 |  Unice Seymour and his goalkeeping contingent
[3759.76 - 3763.76] P:1803.29 E:0.109909 |  in front of the bright red wall of Spanish fans away to our right.
[3763.76 - 3766.76] P:1837.71 E:0.108524 |  There's just a glimmer of sunshine shining on them.
[3766.76 - 3770.76] P:1712.68 E:0.110361 |  And the whole stadium is actually singing Wonderwall at the moment.
[3770.76 - 3772.76] P:1739.52 E:0.103484 |  And let's hear from Gareth Southgate,
[3772.76 - 3775.76] P:1880.32 E:0.108586 |  who a few moments ago was pitched side with Kelly Summers.
[3775.76 - 3779.76] P:1677.02 E:0.088883 |  Gareth, another Euro's final, three years on from the last one.
[3779.76 - 3782.76] P:1539.74 E:0.073113 |  How does the feeling going into this one compare to the last one?
[3782.76 - 3787.76] P:1383.14 E:0.078170 |  Yeah, it's a really good question because we feel calm.
[3787.76 - 3791.76] P:1230.79 E:0.082118 |  I think we realise what a wonderful opportunity.
[3791.76 - 3795.76] P:1434.62 E:0.081537 |  And football is about days like this with the chance
[3795.76 - 3799.76] P:1599.81 E:0.077583 |  to make history, the chance to make our country happy.
[3799.76 - 3802.76] P:1364.66 E:0.083222 |  And we've got to make sure we do it.
[3802.76 - 3804.76] P:1397.57 E:0.085764 |  One change to your side tonight.
[3804.76 - 3805.76] P:1630.98 E:0.086140 |  Luke Shaw starts.
[3805.76 - 3809.76] P:1498.65 E:0.064377 |  Tests don't get much bigger, do they, than having to stop Lameenya Maltonite?
[3809.76 - 3811.76] P:1716.53 E:0.062494 |  No, but he's an experienced player.
[3811.76 - 3815.76] P:1498.91 E:0.080348 |  And we feel that his return to play we've managed pretty well.
[3815.76 - 3818.76] P:1351.62 E:0.084663 |  He clearly gives us that balance on the left.
[3818.76 - 3821.76] P:1405.30 E:0.082245 |  So, yeah, he's ready to play.
[3821.76 - 3823.76] P:1442.56 E:0.079667 |  I mean, Kieran's done a brilliant job for the team.
[3823.76 - 3828.76] P:1398.87 E:0.086135 |  And the way he's handled everything the last few weeks has been absolutely top class.
[3828.76 - 3831.76] P:1280.12 E:0.080410 |  This week you said to beat Spain, you'll need to be perfect.
[3831.76 - 3833.76] P:1472.91 E:0.054177 |  What does that entail?
[3833.76 - 3835.76] P:1430.78 E:0.094067 |  Well, firstly, we've got to use the ball well.
[3835.76 - 3836.76] P:1359.24 E:0.076992 |  They press really well.
[3836.76 - 3842.76] P:1385.58 E:0.086649 |  We've got to move the ball quickly through their press or around their press.
[3842.76 - 3845.76] P:1244.53 E:0.094511 |  And then we've got to be disciplined in the way we defend.
[3845.76 - 3848.76] P:1507.07 E:0.081123 |  You can't just go tearing around the pitch.
[3848.76 - 3849.76] P:1080.33 E:0.091575 |  They've got good players.
[3849.76 - 3850.76] P:1132.83 E:0.080497 |  They use the ball well.
[3850.76 - 3855.76] P:1385.95 E:0.081814 |  But we really believe we've got everything in the squad to be able to get the win.
[3855.76 - 3858.76] P:1546.73 E:0.077868 |  Your team have made so much history over the past eight years.
[3858.76 - 3860.76] P:1469.62 E:0.075638 |  You could make the biggest piece of history tonight.
[3860.76 - 3863.76] P:1477.57 E:0.077933 |  What would it mean to you to lift the trophy later this evening?
[3863.76 - 3866.76] P:1275.61 E:0.079460 |  Yeah, it isn't about what it means to me.
[3866.76 - 3869.76] P:1559.85 E:0.083426 |  It's about what it means for English football.
[3869.76 - 3874.76] P:1505.78 E:0.077590 |  This group of players have been privileged to work with for the last six weeks.
[3874.76 - 3877.76] P:1492.06 E:0.078266 |  And we want to give everybody the night of their lives.
[3877.76 - 3878.76] P:1354.74 E:0.091992 |  One final sign. Best of luck.
[3878.76 - 3879.76] P:1840.74 E:0.033999 |  Thank you.
[3880.76 - 3886.76] P:1827.00 E:0.102796 |  Behind closed doors, John Murray, it will mean something to him.
[3886.76 - 3895.76] P:1696.72 E:0.099900 |  But his whole tenure has never been about him on the positive side of things.
[3895.76 - 3898.76] P:1766.66 E:0.102765 |  Only about him on the negative side of things.
[3898.76 - 3902.76] P:1906.07 E:0.092110 |  I.e. he'll take the negative stuff head on to protect his players.
[3902.76 - 3903.76] P:1788.84 E:0.113111 |  Yeah, we saw that.
[3903.76 - 3909.76] P:1822.57 E:0.107117 |  I thought particularly so after the disappointing draw against Slovenia
[3909.76 - 3912.76] P:1779.12 E:0.104599 |  in the third group match when England did finish top of the group.
[3912.76 - 3916.76] P:1761.88 E:0.108049 |  But the performances in that match and, of course, most of the match against Denmark
[3916.76 - 3917.76] P:1619.89 E:0.115619 |  had been very, very poor.
[3917.76 - 3919.76] P:1883.55 E:0.101841 |  And he took it on himself, didn't he?
[3919.76 - 3920.76] P:1597.34 E:0.110035 |  Broke away from the players.
[3920.76 - 3922.76] P:1749.97 E:0.103121 |  He went to the supporters.
[3922.76 - 3925.76] P:1872.67 E:0.113441 |  He knew very well what the reaction was going to be like.
[3925.76 - 3928.76] P:1920.71 E:0.095174 |  But he was saying to the players exactly what you've articulated there,
[3928.76 - 3931.76] P:1744.90 E:0.096364 |  that I'm going to take this on myself.
[3931.76 - 3937.76] P:1888.64 E:0.090649 |  And I just find the whole Southgate story, it is just compelling.
[3937.76 - 3941.76] P:1794.39 E:0.105159 |  Where it all goes back to the missed penalty at Euro 96,
[3941.76 - 3946.76] P:1837.81 E:0.100906 |  his own faltering managerial career, really, then his move to the FA,
[3946.76 - 3949.76] P:1878.39 E:0.096113 |  and then ending up in this job after Sam Alladais.
[3949.76 - 3952.76] P:1849.25 E:0.098387 |  And the eight years that we've had, the ups and downs,
[3952.76 - 3954.76] P:1775.31 E:0.113808 |  the fact that there was the penalty shootout,
[3954.76 - 3956.76] P:1823.59 E:0.103610 |  Vukaj Osakar in exactly the same position as he was,
[3956.76 - 3960.76] P:1832.92 E:0.090896 |  Saka scores in the penalty shootout win against Switzerland.
[3960.76 - 3962.76] P:1896.21 E:0.105529 |  And here we are back in the final.
[3962.76 - 3965.76] P:1934.63 E:0.096984 |  It just feels like an incredible story
[3965.76 - 3968.76] P:1823.13 E:0.099469 |  that leads, needs a last chapter, right then.
[3968.76 - 3972.76] P:1872.14 E:0.106175 |  I mean, we are in the final, although at the moment it feels like a 90s karaoke night.
[3972.76 - 3974.76] P:1896.40 E:0.106066 |  But... Good for you then.
[3974.76 - 3976.76] P:1700.84 E:0.106550 |  I'm completely ameliorated.
[3976.76 - 3979.76] P:1735.99 E:0.110648 |  Whether to ask a question or break into song, it can't work out.
[3979.76 - 3981.76] P:1762.54 E:0.107521 |  Chris, your views on Garas Southgate,
[3981.76 - 3984.76] P:1794.24 E:0.108744 |  the producers just said to me, she wants me to sing.
[3984.76 - 3986.76] P:1803.43 E:0.115913 |  So, answer the question.
[3986.76 - 3989.76] P:1812.74 E:0.100284 |  I'd rather give you my views on Garas Southgate.
[3989.76 - 3994.76] P:1849.21 E:0.113283 |  Look, is it a guy who, for some strange reason, I don't get it,
[3994.76 - 3998.76] P:1849.13 E:0.112493 |  where his managerial career with England has sort of split the country.
[3998.76 - 4001.76] P:1808.70 E:0.109789 |  There are a lot of people who don't rate him,
[4001.76 - 4005.76] P:1927.36 E:0.102291 |  or don't view him as a pure coach.
[4005.76 - 4008.76] P:1863.73 E:0.101654 |  I think that that is really unfair.
[4008.76 - 4011.76] P:1911.95 E:0.098861 |  I suggest that you look at the job which he's done.
[4011.76 - 4015.76] P:1793.30 E:0.110429 |  We're sitting here in Berlin tonight, back-to-back Eurofinals.
[4015.76 - 4017.76] P:1841.36 E:0.103684 |  I mean, that's amazing in itself.
[4017.76 - 4021.76] P:1855.76 E:0.109540 |  A guy who's got us to a World Cup semi-finals,
[4021.76 - 4023.76] P:1855.86 E:0.106825 |  to a World Cup quarter-final.
[4023.76 - 4025.76] P:1900.02 E:0.107084 |  Harry came, missed the penalty in that.
[4025.76 - 4027.76] P:1918.02 E:0.109161 |  Things could have been different.
[4027.76 - 4030.76] P:1916.10 E:0.111755 |  But over the piece, Gareth has created his own history.
[4030.76 - 4032.76] P:1941.76 E:0.111140 |  I'm a bit like John.
[4032.76 - 4035.76] P:1916.41 E:0.101646 |  I'd just like to see for him more than anybody,
[4035.76 - 4039.76] P:1908.04 E:0.108086 |  England make that final step and become triumphant this evening,
[4039.76 - 4041.76] P:1929.86 E:0.108241 |  because I think he deserves it.
[4041.76 - 4043.76] P:1922.03 E:0.101210 |  This is a guy, England top the group,
[4043.76 - 4047.76] P:1823.66 E:0.109085 |  and then people are chucking things out at Gareth about how easy the draw is.
[4047.76 - 4049.76] P:1947.63 E:0.101835 |  What more can he do?
[4049.76 - 4052.76] P:1828.89 E:0.114718 |  I put money on S-Cup 7 Reats, going on next, but go on.
[4052.76 - 4056.76] P:1954.38 E:0.104235 |  I think that if they lose tonight,
[4056.76 - 4059.76] P:1979.86 E:0.108117 |  I think the critics will rise again,
[4059.76 - 4062.76] P:1840.17 E:0.113652 |  because he hasn't been able to win the trophy.
[4062.76 - 4065.76] P:1959.28 E:0.109523 |  I'm certain of that, but what I would say is,
[4065.76 - 4068.76] P:1948.46 E:0.108768 |  I think in years, in decades to come,
[4068.76 - 4072.76] P:1925.97 E:0.111077 |  I think history will be very kind to Gareth Southgate as the England manager.
[4072.76 - 4075.76] P:1910.94 E:0.117288 |  It's not just about the senior side.
[4075.76 - 4077.76] P:2040.74 E:0.113840 |  I think it was 2010.
[4077.76 - 4080.76] P:1959.85 E:0.117694 |  England had this plan called the English DNA.
[4080.76 - 4083.76] P:1856.55 E:0.103069 |  Dan Ashworth was heavily involved with Gareth.
[4083.76 - 4086.76] P:2047.73 E:0.108571 |  You look at other European nations,
[4086.76 - 4090.76] P:1983.08 E:0.110983 |  and you see how they treated the under-17s,
[4090.76 - 4092.76] P:1937.54 E:0.117680 |  the under-19s, the under-21s.
[4092.76 - 4096.76] P:1955.90 E:0.115901 |  Even the under-21s, we've been quite disparaging about that in the past.
[4096.76 - 4099.76] P:1923.40 E:0.111804 |  When we won it last year, ironically against Spain,
[4099.76 - 4102.76] P:1909.73 E:0.114760 |  it was the first time that England had won it since about 1984.
[4102.76 - 4106.76] P:1918.49 E:0.112752 |  But since that DNA was formed,
[4106.76 - 4108.76] P:1938.23 E:0.108959 |  and they went to St George's Park,
[4108.76 - 4111.76] P:1867.15 E:0.103788 |  they've had success at the under-17s,
[4111.76 - 4113.76] P:1935.27 E:0.105676 |  winning the World Cup against Spain.
[4113.76 - 4115.76] P:1933.56 E:0.091089 |  They've had obviously the under-21s last year.
[4115.76 - 4117.76] P:1996.28 E:0.095563 |  The under-19s have won it.
[4117.76 - 4119.76] P:1897.71 E:0.080057 |  The women have won it.
[4119.76 - 4120.76] P:1984.61 E:0.106673 |  The Euros.
[4120.76 - 4122.76] P:2011.07 E:0.108267 |  It's all at St George's Park,
[4122.76 - 4124.76] P:1945.58 E:0.106944 |  so it's not just about the national side,
[4124.76 - 4129.76] P:1876.46 E:0.101070 |  where Gareth Southgate has actually helped transform the national setup.
[4130.76 - 4132.76] P:1795.29 E:0.106461 |  Whether or not this is right,
[4132.76 - 4137.76] P:1681.13 E:0.105276 |  for me, it runs deeper than winning a trophy,
[4137.76 - 4139.76] P:1827.49 E:0.101445 |  because what he's laid down,
[4139.76 - 4142.76] P:1862.06 E:0.096137 |  the foundations that he's laid down about,
[4142.76 - 4145.76] P:1764.22 E:0.109622 |  having a balanced level environment
[4145.76 - 4148.76] P:1878.55 E:0.102487 |  to come and enjoy, be part of a team,
[4148.76 - 4150.76] P:1941.76 E:0.111498 |  level across the board
[4150.76 - 4152.76] P:1917.42 E:0.108862 |  in terms of how people are treated,
[4152.76 - 4154.76] P:1933.01 E:0.111927 |  and the encouragement and what have you.
[4154.76 - 4156.76] P:1904.62 E:0.110085 |  And to develop that the way he has,
[4156.76 - 4158.76] P:1911.13 E:0.106318 |  from all of these experiences
[4158.76 - 4160.76] P:1925.84 E:0.106792 |  that he's had as a player and a coach,
[4160.76 - 4162.76] P:1886.65 E:0.112286 |  is what you see here in this England team,
[4162.76 - 4165.76] P:1892.84 E:0.109703 |  and has he done a lot of the yards
[4165.76 - 4168.76] P:1860.94 E:0.110351 |  that a lot of the top coaches have in terms of games managed?
[4168.76 - 4170.76] P:1786.48 E:0.117890 |  No, he hasn't probably got that repertoire,
[4170.76 - 4172.76] P:1821.33 E:0.115446 |  but he's managed massive games now.
[4172.76 - 4174.76] P:1774.22 E:0.122685 |  Sven has written in the Telegraph,
[4174.76 - 4178.76] P:1714.04 E:0.114542 |  wrote a dig, Gareth article in the Telegraph, Chris.
[4178.76 - 4179.76] P:1790.09 E:0.111407 |  He says,
[4179.76 - 4182.76] P:1767.24 E:0.114009 |  the job of England manager brings with it a beautiful pressure.
[4182.76 - 4185.76] P:1846.99 E:0.102923 |  I feel it, Sir Bobby Robson felt it.
[4185.76 - 4188.76] P:1849.36 E:0.113571 |  Every one of the 13 managers since Sir Al
[4188.76 - 4189.76] P:1746.30 E:0.095718 |  will have felt it.
[4189.76 - 4191.76] P:1947.08 E:0.108417 |  None of us succeeded,
[4191.76 - 4194.76] P:1817.42 E:0.105051 |  but none has come closer than Gareth Southgate.
[4194.76 - 4197.76] P:1744.61 E:0.101078 |  Yep, and all true.
[4197.76 - 4200.76] P:1864.68 E:0.123232 |  I remember 1990 very well,
[4200.76 - 4201.76] P:1907.02 E:0.114049 |  the excitement of that World Cup
[4201.76 - 4204.76] P:1922.23 E:0.120984 |  where England nearly got there,
[4204.76 - 4209.76] P:1927.95 E:0.115412 |  the famous Gazzamoment and what have you.
[4209.76 - 4213.76] P:1904.05 E:0.110649 |  And that's something which I think,
[4213.76 - 4217.76] P:1902.63 E:0.114550 |  it's been so harsh, the criticism towards Gareth.
[4217.76 - 4219.76] P:1854.47 E:0.120142 |  When you think of his eight years
[4219.76 - 4221.76] P:1797.43 E:0.117569 |  and what England have done,
[4221.76 - 4224.76] P:1846.58 E:0.117070 |  and the building blocks which Matt has spoken about,
[4224.76 - 4226.76] P:1788.53 E:0.119290 |  which have been put in place,
[4226.76 - 4228.76] P:1817.98 E:0.113293 |  and very, very similar to the Spanish manager,
[4228.76 - 4230.76] P:1782.27 E:0.119119 |  Gilles LeFrenter in terms of building blocks
[4230.76 - 4232.76] P:1762.59 E:0.112260 |  with the younger team,
[4232.76 - 4235.76] P:1778.86 E:0.115155 |  and then developing into the senior manager.
[4235.76 - 4239.76] P:1834.49 E:0.108765 |  But I do think from Gareth's perspective,
[4239.76 - 4242.76] P:1741.95 E:0.115534 |  he will go down in folklore if he gets over the line.
[4242.76 - 4244.76] P:1775.91 E:0.114968 |  I agree with John, in years to come,
[4244.76 - 4247.76] P:1740.98 E:0.101154 |  there will be that deeper respect
[4247.76 - 4249.76] P:1645.52 E:0.119602 |  from your real football fan
[4249.76 - 4251.76] P:1835.34 E:0.110987 |  who looks back at these years and these finals,
[4251.76 - 4253.76] P:1688.26 E:0.106288 |  regardless whether England win tonight,
[4253.76 - 4256.76] P:1794.10 E:0.110781 |  and think, blimey, he's done a really excellent job.
[4256.76 - 4259.76] P:1846.21 E:0.094639 |  Is he Chrisius at pitside?
[4259.76 - 4261.76] P:1796.47 E:0.120138 |  Yeah, apart from John Pitfid singing along
[4261.76 - 4263.76] P:1578.84 E:0.117581 |  to Robbie Williams Angels,
[4263.76 - 4265.76] P:1827.97 E:0.105396 |  and a bit of a racist before,
[4265.76 - 4267.76] P:1690.40 E:0.104967 |  in sync to doing his leg swings in the warm-up,
[4267.76 - 4269.76] P:1713.46 E:0.102337 |  which I thought was impressive.
[4269.76 - 4272.76] P:1642.28 E:0.118539 |  And yeah, just quickly on Gareth Southgate,
[4272.76 - 4275.76] P:1767.39 E:0.107430 |  I would say he's more of a cultural architect.
[4275.76 - 4277.76] P:1821.23 E:0.100697 |  And then he's a coach,
[4277.76 - 4279.76] P:1697.68 E:0.114641 |  and he uses the staff,
[4279.76 - 4281.76] P:1566.00 E:0.118255 |  Steve Holland is assistant coach, Jimmy Floyd Assabanko,
[4281.76 - 4283.76] P:1756.78 E:0.106627 |  I'm staring at right now,
[4283.76 - 4286.76] P:1751.50 E:0.110996 |  going around the group always with a smile on his face.
[4286.76 - 4289.76] P:1629.61 E:0.114127 |  He just knows how to blend the squad together,
[4289.76 - 4292.76] P:1741.13 E:0.110698 |  and I said it earlier, I see no surprise
[4292.76 - 4295.76] P:1776.88 E:0.101993 |  that the way that he's enhanced this group,
[4295.76 - 4297.76] P:1557.73 E:0.125147 |  bringing up the enthusiasm of youth
[4297.76 - 4299.76] P:1721.09 E:0.109527 |  that like Deno touched on,
[4299.76 - 4301.76] P:1789.89 E:0.110829 |  have been successful in the youth age groups with England,
[4301.76 - 4303.76] P:1740.74 E:0.112873 |  bringing them in, blending them with the experience
[4303.76 - 4305.76] P:1763.86 E:0.106471 |  that's in this squad.
[4305.76 - 4307.76] P:1765.65 E:0.119215 |  He's just done a terrific job,
[4307.76 - 4309.76] P:1636.84 E:0.108075 |  and the boys seem to be absolutely delighted
[4309.76 - 4311.76] P:1700.58 E:0.108655 |  to meet up with each other, play with each other,
[4311.76 - 4314.76] P:1612.37 E:0.104498 |  and then what better than this, playing in a European final?
[4314.76 - 4318.76] P:1606.96 E:0.109803 |  And I also think what might be top of the bill
[4318.76 - 4321.76] P:1674.04 E:0.115676 |  out of all of it, is the fact that you can't help,
[4321.76 - 4323.76] P:1751.35 E:0.116480 |  whether you agree with a style of play,
[4323.76 - 4325.76] P:1768.14 E:0.104670 |  or him as a coach, or his tack, whatever,
[4325.76 - 4327.76] P:1786.60 E:0.119809 |  you can't help but step away and mire
[4327.76 - 4330.76] P:1640.28 E:0.108229 |  that he's an absolute class act as a human being,
[4330.76 - 4332.76] P:1695.49 E:0.111497 |  and the way he's absorbed this stuff,
[4332.76 - 4334.76] P:1719.19 E:0.116565 |  the way he's faced it, the way he's dealt with it,
[4334.76 - 4337.76] P:1553.60 E:0.110007 |  how he speaks, you can't help but step away.
[4337.76 - 4340.76] P:1746.25 E:0.109764 |  He's just a blooming decent bloke.
[4340.76 - 4342.76] P:1692.25 E:0.121552 |  I'm joking about the songs that are being played,
[4342.76 - 4345.76] P:1749.57 E:0.108108 |  but what strikes me, John Murray, at the moment,
[4345.76 - 4351.76] P:1644.92 E:0.109322 |  is this has a very different feel tonight than three years ago.
[4351.76 - 4353.76] P:1710.03 E:0.120359 |  I don't want to, I'm not trying to temp fate,
[4353.76 - 4356.76] P:1860.21 E:0.113395 |  I'm not trying to go there, but by this stage three years ago,
[4356.76 - 4362.76] P:1641.72 E:0.092019 |  it was horrible, and we were starting to try to find a balance
[4362.76 - 4364.76] P:1686.15 E:0.121689 |  through looking forward to the game,
[4364.76 - 4367.76] P:1692.23 E:0.104678 |  and knowing that there was a lot of disgraceful
[4367.76 - 4370.76] P:1729.48 E:0.102094 |  and disgusting scenes going on around Wembley,
[4370.76 - 4373.76] P:1715.83 E:0.115042 |  it feels more of a party vibe inside the moment.
[4373.76 - 4375.76] P:1681.59 E:0.110275 |  The Spanish fans have sung along with Vindaloo
[4375.76 - 4379.76] P:1621.79 E:0.113490 |  and footballs coming home, it feels different at the moment.
[4379.76 - 4381.76] P:1718.22 E:0.109426 |  I think it's important to say that.
[4381.76 - 4383.76] P:1667.03 E:0.105465 |  Absolutely, at the moment.
[4383.76 - 4387.76] P:1751.03 E:0.113125 |  The feeling this morning, I thought, was very similar.
[4387.76 - 4389.76] P:1653.76 E:0.108582 |  I remember thinking to myself,
[4389.76 - 4392.76] P:1734.29 E:0.113557 |  I do remember feeling like this in advance of the game at Wembley,
[4392.76 - 4395.76] P:1700.24 E:0.104119 |  and the excitement, let's get it in perspective,
[4395.76 - 4397.76] P:1872.21 E:0.112931 |  what we do in and out.
[4397.76 - 4400.76] P:1789.07 E:0.110464 |  We are observers, we commentate on the match,
[4400.76 - 4403.76] P:1758.24 E:0.110567 |  but it's obviously a big night in our professional lives,
[4403.76 - 4406.76] P:1649.01 E:0.114188 |  it's an exciting night about what we might be able to describe.
[4406.76 - 4409.76] P:1767.26 E:0.102840 |  I remember three years ago just thinking about
[4409.76 - 4412.76] P:1817.73 E:0.106725 |  what might lie ahead, and how it could be
[4412.76 - 4416.76] P:1798.52 E:0.107225 |  one of the most satisfying and enjoyable nights of my professional life.
[4416.76 - 4419.76] P:1829.96 E:0.107180 |  It turned out to be one of the most traumatic.
[4419.76 - 4422.76] P:1738.22 E:0.111011 |  It was, you know, a night I'll never forget
[4422.76 - 4424.76] P:1838.99 E:0.115044 |  for many, many of the wrong reasons.
[4424.76 - 4427.76] P:1839.57 E:0.109927 |  And that's why I think there's another reason tonight
[4427.76 - 4430.76] P:1782.37 E:0.105912 |  for England to try and put things right
[4430.76 - 4433.76] P:1816.44 E:0.102044 |  and put that right in the past.
[4433.76 - 4436.76] P:1739.55 E:0.111816 |  There is gear, Balak, isn't it?
[4436.76 - 4439.76] P:1748.34 E:0.114498 |  It just feels like there's a real party atmosphere at the moment.
[4439.76 - 4442.76] P:1778.08 E:0.094192 |  Because you play at home, there's a lot of you,
[4442.76 - 4444.76] P:1853.48 E:0.111983 |  there's five of you for each one of us.
[4444.76 - 4448.76] P:1910.10 E:0.107312 |  So you've got the numbers you did, it's roughly 50,000 to 12,000.
[4448.76 - 4451.76] P:1784.37 E:0.099484 |  We were talking about it with the Spanish Federation,
[4451.76 - 4455.76] P:1719.40 E:0.101803 |  because they were given about 12,500 tickets, same as the FA,
[4455.76 - 4459.76] P:1742.39 E:0.088736 |  but England fans, very clever,
[4459.76 - 4463.76] P:1729.89 E:0.100929 |  they actually started buying tickets before the Tournament started.
[4463.76 - 4466.76] P:1784.08 E:0.102336 |  When UEFA released new tickets,
[4466.76 - 4469.76] P:1658.29 E:0.105604 |  they rewarded those that have been followed the national side,
[4469.76 - 4472.76] P:1819.11 E:0.100651 |  and usually we don't travel, England fans travel.
[4472.76 - 4476.76] P:1815.67 E:0.104748 |  And, you know, they're very good at moving around and getting tickets.
[4476.76 - 4478.76] P:1808.26 E:0.101098 |  It's not a problem, it's not a problem.
[4478.76 - 4481.76] P:1823.41 E:0.106949 |  Could Spanish fans have not thought of that?
[4481.76 - 4483.76] P:1779.57 E:0.111289 |  Is the internet slow in Spain?
[4483.76 - 4486.76] P:1859.28 E:0.114883 |  No, we just don't care that much, we keep winning, Chris.
[4486.76 - 4490.76] P:1805.33 E:0.108259 |  So, you know, not that exceptional, this.
[4490.76 - 4494.76] P:1752.86 E:0.114183 |  As Guillaume says, Spain keep winning the dominated world football
[4494.76 - 4497.76] P:1813.61 E:0.109013 |  between 2008 and 2012,
[4497.76 - 4499.76] P:1874.02 E:0.115054 |  they won two Euros, one World Cup.
[4499.76 - 4502.76] P:1871.69 E:0.104255 |  Former Chelsea and Manchester United midfielder
[4502.76 - 4504.76] P:1752.84 E:0.102637 |  played a part in the 2010 World Cup,
[4504.76 - 4507.76] P:1893.71 E:0.106220 |  they also scored in the Euro 2012 final.
[4507.76 - 4509.76] P:1762.68 E:0.109349 |  He was on five live with us earlier,
[4509.76 - 4511.76] P:1766.67 E:0.107056 |  and telling us about the current team,
[4511.76 - 4514.76] P:1873.92 E:0.097052 |  but also what playing in his squad was like.
[4514.76 - 4518.76] P:1667.33 E:0.085641 |  I've never felt as confident as we were there in any other team.
[4518.76 - 4521.76] P:1317.06 E:0.094300 |  Like, we were playing against the biggest nations in the world,
[4521.76 - 4524.76] P:1542.94 E:0.074871 |  and we felt, okay, let's see if we win one or two nil today.
[4524.76 - 4527.76] P:1660.41 E:0.070148 |  So, there was never a fear of maybe we lose,
[4527.76 - 4529.76] P:1582.91 E:0.084617 |  and that was incredible.
[4529.76 - 4532.76] P:1605.61 E:0.089850 |  We played against France away, England, all the biggest countries,
[4532.76 - 4534.76] P:1375.35 E:0.083055 |  and we felt, okay, we're going to win today.
[4534.76 - 4537.76] P:1773.47 E:0.091416 |  So, having that mentality and feeling like a family,
[4537.76 - 4539.76] P:1205.08 E:0.099143 |  because we were there for many years,
[4539.76 - 4543.76] P:1459.83 E:0.089224 |  more or less the same players together, until 2014 or something like that.
[4543.76 - 4547.76] P:1490.55 E:0.075049 |  So, it was a great feeling of, we are enjoying football,
[4547.76 - 4550.76] P:1145.25 E:0.089791 |  we are playing at our best, and we are winning every single game.
[4550.76 - 4553.76] P:1554.84 E:0.086331 |  So, the night before every game, we met in Pepe's room.
[4553.76 - 4558.76] P:1449.40 E:0.074620 |  We used to have some hot chocolate croissants, plate cards,
[4558.76 - 4561.76] P:1596.75 E:0.066093 |  talk, and go to sleep late, actually.
[4561.76 - 4563.76] P:929.46 E:0.110971 |  So, the doctor was not happy with that,
[4563.76 - 4566.76] P:1562.37 E:0.083364 |  but we won every game because of the camaraderie, you know, the connection.
[4566.76 - 4570.76] P:1358.70 E:0.087216 |  And so, yeah, the captains, Pepe, Fernando Torres,
[4570.76 - 4573.76] P:1360.96 E:0.073738 |  I mean, we had a lot of important players.
[4573.76 - 4575.76] P:1791.60 E:0.093818 |  We have two head coaches this evening,
[4575.76 - 4579.76] P:1707.78 E:0.076165 |  two team managers who've come through the age groups
[4579.76 - 4582.76] P:1380.17 E:0.074000 |  within the national setup.
[4582.76 - 4586.76] P:1706.87 E:0.075403 |  How important do you think that is, and how significant?
[4586.76 - 4588.76] P:1423.82 E:0.090459 |  Very, very important for this generation of players,
[4588.76 - 4592.76] P:1305.93 E:0.075426 |  because many of the players that are playing great now,
[4592.76 - 4594.76] P:1470.19 E:0.069237 |  and they're feeling that they're important players,
[4594.76 - 4597.76] P:1657.38 E:0.065628 |  like Fabián Ruiz, Daniel, Mo, Nico,
[4597.76 - 4599.76] P:1401.14 E:0.076991 |  he had them when they were kids.
[4599.76 - 4602.76] P:1655.76 E:0.087397 |  He had them when they were under 15, under 17, under 19.
[4602.76 - 4607.76] P:1704.57 E:0.072026 |  When he took charge, he said that he knew all the players in Spain
[4607.76 - 4611.76] P:1701.90 E:0.066421 |  from 15 years to 18 years, and I think that was true.
[4611.76 - 4615.76] P:1719.82 E:0.088684 |  Of course, he's showing it, but he's giving responsibility to players
[4615.76 - 4617.76] P:1136.59 E:0.086449 |  that maybe other coaches wouldn't have,
[4617.76 - 4620.76] P:1401.80 E:0.068431 |  but he knew they could give him what they're doing now,
[4620.76 - 4624.76] P:1586.87 E:0.081499 |  like Fabián, for example, which I think has been one of the best players
[4624.76 - 4627.76] P:1715.13 E:0.069628 |  in the tournament alongside Rodri.
[4627.76 - 4630.76] P:1363.89 E:0.078668 |  Maybe another coach wouldn't have picked him,
[4630.76 - 4633.76] P:1512.91 E:0.069065 |  but I think it's credit to the coach to spot the players
[4633.76 - 4637.76] P:1483.19 E:0.074585 |  that he thought could play his style and bring them to the best level.
[4637.76 - 4640.76] P:1613.43 E:0.101004 |  Olmo looks for Marata, comes out to Yamael,
[4640.76 - 4643.76] P:1745.91 E:0.114826 |  Yamael onto his left foot, goes for Kelly Yeppas!
[4643.76 - 4646.76] P:1747.83 E:0.123789 |  Oh, what a super goal! What a super goal!
[4646.76 - 4649.76] P:1592.15 E:0.122282 |  And a crowing moment for Lomín Yamael,
[4649.76 - 4653.76] P:1576.17 E:0.120978 |  the youngest ever player in a European championship,
[4653.76 - 4658.76] P:1600.33 E:0.119429 |  is now the youngest ever goal scorer in the history of the European championship,
[4658.76 - 4660.76] P:1556.81 E:0.119232 |  and that is a goal to remember!
[4660.76 - 4664.76] P:1537.02 E:0.074414 |  I've watched yesterday with Xavi, and the way he speaks about him
[4664.76 - 4668.76] P:1541.99 E:0.080227 |  is like he's never been such a unique talent for... since many, many years,
[4668.76 - 4671.76] P:1690.58 E:0.103339 |  and he was the one that saw him in the academy
[4671.76 - 4675.76] P:1617.75 E:0.086685 |  and put him in the first team when he was 15 or almost 16,
[4675.76 - 4681.76] P:1761.90 E:0.079119 |  so it has to be so special to be performing for both Barcelona,
[4681.76 - 4684.76] P:1343.53 E:0.090730 |  Wiking, Wicoud, and now the national team in the Euros
[4684.76 - 4687.76] P:1748.50 E:0.088910 |  to be doing what he's doing, and what I love about him is
[4687.76 - 4690.76] P:1488.29 E:0.080392 |  that he's the other defenders, older than them, more experienced than them,
[4690.76 - 4693.76] P:1544.08 E:0.068263 |  they're afraid of him, and what I love from him also is that
[4693.76 - 4696.76] P:1470.60 E:0.085135 |  he's not only a one against one player, he makes the right decisions,
[4696.76 - 4699.76] P:1734.23 E:0.071240 |  he plays the pass when he has to, he shoots when he has to,
[4699.76 - 4703.76] P:1667.94 E:0.077347 |  and I think for his age, of course, a super complete player.
[4703.76 - 4706.76] P:1331.16 E:0.086080 |  But both wingers will do that for Spain, won't they?
[4706.76 - 4709.76] P:1483.35 E:0.098346 |  We have been in an era of so many wide men,
[4709.76 - 4712.76] P:1628.61 E:0.067615 |  take it, come back inside, give it to them in the field,
[4712.76 - 4716.76] P:1334.51 E:0.090183 |  and what Spain, I know both will come inside as well,
[4716.76 - 4718.76] P:1512.30 E:0.085418 |  but they have a directness about them.
[4718.76 - 4721.76] P:1277.70 E:0.091585 |  Very much, both him and Nico Williams, which is also playing great,
[4721.76 - 4724.76] P:1443.87 E:0.076627 |  I mean, he's even quicker than Lameela, I think,
[4724.76 - 4727.76] P:1252.16 E:0.086749 |  but they're a little bit different, but both very vertical,
[4727.76 - 4731.76] P:1586.20 E:0.071841 |  and credit to the coach, credit to Luis de la Fuente
[4731.76 - 4734.76] P:1713.49 E:0.075658 |  for acknowledging that they both could stretch the pitch,
[4734.76 - 4738.76] P:1555.30 E:0.084946 |  make so wide, and one against one, they're very, very good.
[4739.76 - 4743.76] P:1800.19 E:0.116032 |  That was one matter to talk to me a little earlier on
[4743.76 - 4748.76] P:1812.23 E:0.106809 |  when we did a show at lunchtime, Guillain Balagay, Chris Sutton in Dennis,
[4748.76 - 4750.76] P:1818.63 E:0.100906 |  Giorgio Mori Matux and Izzy Christensen,
[4750.76 - 4754.76] P:1889.79 E:0.103667 |  all part of our team here in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin
[4754.76 - 4758.76] P:1779.36 E:0.103566 |  as the sun starts to set away to our left.
[4758.76 - 4762.76] P:1785.40 E:0.087828 |  Just try and explain, and we've touched on it before, Guillain,
[4762.76 - 4765.76] P:1822.01 E:0.105991 |  but the difference that Luis de la Fuente has made
[4765.76 - 4767.76] P:1828.49 E:0.108313 |  to the culture of the Spanish team?
[4767.76 - 4770.76] P:1873.35 E:0.092857 |  Yeah, the idea is an all-idea, if you like.
[4770.76 - 4773.76] P:1860.01 E:0.103815 |  Let's make this federation, this football team, a club.
[4773.76 - 4776.76] P:1887.94 E:0.093951 |  So let's treat it almost like a club.
[4776.76 - 4778.76] P:1821.37 E:0.106161 |  So what is coming through the ranks?
[4778.76 - 4781.76] P:1837.82 E:0.103017 |  Well, let's use them into the first team.
[4781.76 - 4784.76] P:1774.81 E:0.095425 |  Let's have more meals than you normally have.
[4784.76 - 4787.76] P:1742.27 E:0.096645 |  Let's travel together, let's talk more often to them,
[4787.76 - 4790.76] P:1843.51 E:0.103228 |  and he's created that. That's the number one thing.
[4790.76 - 4794.76] P:1771.51 E:0.102398 |  Secondly, his idea has always been bring me to the club,
[4794.76 - 4798.76] P:1691.06 E:0.094791 |  and he's always been bringing me good people more than good players,
[4798.76 - 4801.76] P:1828.50 E:0.097719 |  just because he knows that there are a lot of good players,
[4801.76 - 4803.76] P:1804.09 E:0.097495 |  but he needs good people for the brand of football
[4803.76 - 4806.76] P:1823.79 E:0.102577 |  that he's put in this play, which is running a lot
[4806.76 - 4810.76] P:1849.23 E:0.089004 |  to try to get the ball back, helping each other,
[4810.76 - 4813.76] P:1683.17 E:0.095564 |  and understanding intelligence.
[4813.76 - 4815.76] P:1881.81 E:0.111384 |  That's what he needs of his players.
[4815.76 - 4818.76] P:1862.05 E:0.099891 |  So all that put together with an ego-free,
[4818.76 - 4820.76] P:1777.96 E:0.101122 |  it's like he never talks about itself.
[4820.76 - 4823.76] P:1740.43 E:0.091952 |  We ask in every press conference a bit of a joke now,
[4823.76 - 4825.76] P:1849.57 E:0.108264 |  what is it you've done for this team?
[4825.76 - 4827.76] P:1744.94 E:0.110276 |  He always answers, I sort of want me.
[4827.76 - 4829.76] P:1828.08 E:0.094097 |  He just never gets him out of that,
[4829.76 - 4832.76] P:1750.15 E:0.103710 |  but he has a very clear idea of what he makes a very good team,
[4832.76 - 4834.76] P:1673.70 E:0.102782 |  and this is the example for him.
[4834.76 - 4838.76] P:1749.44 E:0.102905 |  Did you see lots of similarities with Southgate,
[4838.76 - 4841.76] P:1756.06 E:0.109028 |  as I was explaining it all, discussing with one?
[4841.76 - 4844.76] P:1831.01 E:0.092567 |  Yeah, very much so, because we keep talking about the tactics,
[4844.76 - 4846.76] P:1696.20 E:0.100951 |  and yes, they play in different ways,
[4846.76 - 4848.76] P:1797.01 E:0.090323 |  and perhaps one is more conservative than the other,
[4848.76 - 4851.76] P:1792.14 E:0.089048 |  but they both know that they represent a country.
[4851.76 - 4855.76] P:1802.69 E:0.092439 |  They both try to put in front of everybody's eyes
[4855.76 - 4858.76] P:1838.54 E:0.093708 |  the best values possible, togetherness, cohesion,
[4858.76 - 4862.76] P:1780.49 E:0.112342 |  generosity of effort, understanding of each other.
[4862.76 - 4865.76] P:1801.09 E:0.104212 |  Even the captain, I'm looking at Morata now,
[4865.76 - 4868.76] P:1942.13 E:0.102399 |  the captain chosen by Luis de la Fuente,
[4868.76 - 4870.76] P:1909.87 E:0.104097 |  is similar to a hurricane.
[4870.76 - 4874.76] P:1883.92 E:0.104043 |  This is a guy that is very sensitive, a lovely guy,
[4874.76 - 4877.76] P:1842.41 E:0.112209 |  not the guy that would show the highest, the lowest,
[4877.76 - 4879.76] P:1829.29 E:0.108615 |  but he will look after everybody.
[4879.76 - 4883.76] P:1873.13 E:0.107377 |  So they're more the coaches, and they've got a more the team around them.
[4883.76 - 4888.76] P:1862.26 E:0.116420 |  What was the view in Spain, when he was given the job?
[4888.76 - 4892.76] P:1858.91 E:0.101765 |  Well, imagine if to replace Gareth Southgate, you get John Smith?
[4892.76 - 4895.76] P:1934.82 E:0.104484 |  Some kind of thing. It's like, who is this guy?
[4895.76 - 4897.76] P:1861.37 E:0.102515 |  But then it makes sense, you start looking at it.
[4897.76 - 4900.76] P:1756.26 E:0.107217 |  This is the guy that has won the under 19s European Championships,
[4900.76 - 4905.76] P:1803.60 E:0.107513 |  the under 21s European Championships, the Silver Medal in Tokyo,
[4905.76 - 4912.76] P:1798.57 E:0.105736 |  and he's done it with Cucurella, Unai Simon, Pedri, Broderi, Javián.
[4912.76 - 4915.76] P:1840.10 E:0.106968 |  So, ah, right, he knows the guys. Not only knows the guys,
[4915.76 - 4918.76] P:1878.93 E:0.109884 |  they will kill for him because he's taking them into the first team.
[4918.76 - 4922.76] P:1840.57 E:0.104842 |  He's got to have an ear and an eye on what's new,
[4922.76 - 4926.76] P:1845.69 E:0.109317 |  and he's found his two wingers, and he's put it into the side.
[4926.76 - 4929.76] P:1859.55 E:0.118345 |  If you recall the night when you beat Italy in Gelsenkirk,
[4929.76 - 4931.76] P:1772.67 E:0.110477 |  and we did the commentary, and we were saying that Spain
[4931.76 - 4935.76] P:1745.00 E:0.109076 |  appears to have gone under the radar coming into this tournament,
[4935.76 - 4939.76] P:1904.91 E:0.108845 |  back home, was there not a newspaper article that said now
[4939.76 - 4943.76] P:1890.24 E:0.111788 |  that all of a sudden 50 million people are starting to board the train,
[4943.76 - 4945.76] P:1897.26 E:0.097100 |  and that they started to believe?
[4945.76 - 4947.76] P:1840.91 E:0.103780 |  Yeah, because Italy has always been a reference to us.
[4947.76 - 4949.76] P:1825.74 E:0.102300 |  We've been knocked out by Italy often.
[4949.76 - 4953.76] P:1797.02 E:0.105596 |  We grew into that era of 2008, 2012,
[4953.76 - 4955.76] P:1783.72 E:0.101006 |  from the back of a penalty shootout against Italy.
[4955.76 - 4959.76] P:1761.20 E:0.101266 |  It's our reference point, and the way we did it,
[4959.76 - 4961.76] P:1849.49 E:0.102518 |  it was like we killed them.
[4961.76 - 4963.76] P:1851.63 E:0.098891 |  I don't know if you were in the press conference of Espalete,
[4963.76 - 4967.76] P:1774.83 E:0.100086 |  but it was like, oh my God, for like 45 minutes,
[4967.76 - 4970.76] P:1829.61 E:0.104033 |  oh my God, so we all fell in love with it, including,
[4970.76 - 4973.76] P:1838.95 E:0.097921 |  and this has been interesting, because of the TikTok generation
[4973.76 - 4976.76] P:1761.51 E:0.098770 |  of Lamin Yamal and Nico Williams,
[4976.76 - 4979.76] P:1720.50 E:0.104417 |  there was a bunch of youngsters that weren't interested about football.
[4979.76 - 4982.76] P:1765.28 E:0.089793 |  They just, it was too long, the games are too long,
[4982.76 - 4985.76] P:1770.15 E:0.090042 |  and anyway, just keep me like TikTok or whatever.
[4985.76 - 4989.76] P:1794.25 E:0.091801 |  Now they embraced football because of them too, certainly,
[4989.76 - 4991.76] P:1949.95 E:0.112221 |  but because of the way we play.
[4991.76 - 4994.76] P:1872.20 E:0.088106 |  It's also brave and offensive and good.
[4994.76 - 4996.76] P:1922.39 E:0.110293 |  You don't want to kill that, do you?
[4996.76 - 4998.76] P:1984.81 E:0.087728 |  You should let us win.
[4998.76 - 5003.76] P:1847.38 E:0.104816 |  Let's hear from a player starting for Spain tonight.
[5003.76 - 5006.76] P:1768.50 E:0.105683 |  Certain members of the team have been quite critical
[5006.76 - 5008.76] P:1817.79 E:0.099044 |  of Marc Kucaraya this evening,
[5008.76 - 5010.76] P:1803.83 E:0.093924 |  but he's given a pre-match interview,
[5010.76 - 5013.76] P:1884.98 E:0.106541 |  pitchside about what tonight means for him.
[5014.76 - 5017.76] P:1943.62 E:0.095128 |  Yeah, for sure, I think it's very special to stay here,
[5017.76 - 5020.76] P:1671.41 E:0.102996 |  start the game, this is the final, I think we work very hard,
[5020.76 - 5023.76] P:1865.45 E:0.084659 |  not only me, I think the team, and we deserve to stay here,
[5023.76 - 5026.76] P:1624.29 E:0.091905 |  and today is a night to enjoy, we try to do our best and win the game.
[5026.76 - 5030.76] P:1692.23 E:0.075181 |  I love that phrase, today is a night to enjoy.
[5030.76 - 5034.76] P:1652.45 E:0.072650 |  Apart from winning, how do you enjoy it and forget about the pressure?
[5034.76 - 5038.76] P:1814.19 E:0.079771 |  Yeah, for sure, I think staying here is like a present,
[5038.76 - 5040.76] P:2000.68 E:0.090033 |  I think we work hard a lot to stay here,
[5040.76 - 5042.76] P:1851.19 E:0.095650 |  we need to suffer a lot like a team, like a family,
[5042.76 - 5046.76] P:1728.80 E:0.088899 |  I think we stay a lot of time together, a long way ago we started here,
[5046.76 - 5050.76] P:2010.66 E:0.088736 |  so I think today we need to enjoy, I think we should play in our level,
[5050.76 - 5053.76] P:1821.12 E:0.091902 |  we enjoy this game, I think we have a lot of chances to win.
[5053.76 - 5057.76] P:1571.06 E:0.083728 |  My last one is, I know a lot of your colleagues in the Spain team
[5057.76 - 5061.76] P:1714.70 E:0.093179 |  understand the English football and culture, but you do too.
[5061.76 - 5063.76] P:1695.91 E:0.073081 |  Is there something, anything that's interesting or special
[5063.76 - 5066.76] P:1759.23 E:0.089136 |  about the way that the English approach football?
[5066.76 - 5070.76] P:1887.99 E:0.084466 |  No, I think the English players and the English football is very hard,
[5070.76 - 5073.76] P:1584.27 E:0.091344 |  they have a lot of players with young and with a lot of talent,
[5073.76 - 5076.76] P:1828.56 E:0.086838 |  so today is a tough game, but I think if we do our job,
[5076.76 - 5078.76] P:1710.26 E:0.085773 |  we do what we need to do and what we plan,
[5078.76 - 5081.76] P:1770.30 E:0.082562 |  I think we have big chances to win today.
[5081.76 - 5087.76] P:1783.09 E:0.115223 |  Mark, Kukareya, they're lovely, Mark, to hear how excited he is about tonight.
[5087.76 - 5090.76] P:1827.82 E:0.106351 |  Well, I mean, just imagine what you'd be feeling like
[5090.76 - 5092.76] P:1786.32 E:0.110369 |  if you just criticised him and hammered him
[5092.76 - 5095.76] P:1756.09 E:0.113519 |  when he's about to live his dream tonight.
[5095.76 - 5097.76] P:1793.48 E:0.099798 |  You're trying to make us feel bad.
[5097.76 - 5100.76] P:1783.78 E:0.118584 |  You were very reasonable, I think.
[5100.76 - 5105.76] P:1870.71 E:0.107572 |  Well, I'm always reasonable, but no, it's hard not to look past
[5105.76 - 5109.76] P:1825.14 E:0.101926 |  a potential weak link in the chain there,
[5109.76 - 5111.76] P:1793.35 E:0.118241 |  and I know Gim will defend him all the way
[5111.76 - 5115.76] P:1869.39 E:0.112717 |  and his performances haven't been bad at all.
[5115.76 - 5118.76] P:1896.51 E:0.112875 |  We know him very well from the Premier League,
[5118.76 - 5122.76] P:1773.33 E:0.115525 |  and as Dano's already mentioned, we've seen Sacher up against him.
[5122.76 - 5124.76] P:1856.12 E:0.118460 |  Not that that's any relation to this moment here,
[5124.76 - 5126.76] P:1860.46 E:0.110510 |  because it's completely different in a different environment,
[5126.76 - 5129.76] P:1886.24 E:0.112838 |  having played five games really well,
[5129.76 - 5132.76] P:1854.34 E:0.110193 |  but there's just this thing that the thing that we're going to hold on to
[5132.76 - 5134.76] P:1964.09 E:0.103624 |  is that back post capability.
[5134.76 - 5137.76] P:1897.66 E:0.112675 |  Can we be physical and forceful in that area of the pitch?
[5137.76 - 5139.76] P:1888.42 E:0.126507 |  I just want to go pitch side. Izzy is there,
[5139.76 - 5145.76] P:1771.26 E:0.109486 |  and we're into the last 90 seconds of the pre-match warm-up, Izzy.
[5145.76 - 5150.76] P:1845.87 E:0.117571 |  Yeah, and I am absolutely delighted that England's warm-up goal
[5150.76 - 5152.76] P:1911.98 E:0.120501 |  is not behind in front of me, sorry,
[5152.76 - 5155.76] P:1782.33 E:0.112598 |  because I've spent a lot of the time during this tournament
[5155.76 - 5158.76] P:1860.17 E:0.112741 |  behind the England's shooting area,
[5158.76 - 5161.76] P:1742.90 E:0.106557 |  which, as you can imagine, the way some of those guys hit the ball
[5161.76 - 5164.76] P:1897.13 E:0.108567 |  has been a real challenge dodging the ball
[5164.76 - 5168.76] P:1903.27 E:0.110187 |  whilst staying in tune with you guys up there in the commentary position
[5168.76 - 5171.76] P:1856.68 E:0.103141 |  about when you're going to come next to me, Chappers.
[5171.76 - 5175.76] P:1770.01 E:0.118503 |  What's going to happen next is the teams are going to go off
[5175.76 - 5177.76] P:1879.34 E:0.108146 |  as they do this countdown,
[5177.76 - 5180.76] P:1834.20 E:0.118017 |  and then what looks like about 100 test cricketers
[5180.76 - 5183.76] P:1730.85 E:0.114361 |  have come into the arena, away to our left,
[5183.76 - 5185.76] P:1817.95 E:0.105740 |  dressed in all white.
[5185.76 - 5190.76] P:1765.51 E:0.106040 |  I am assuming they are the dancers for the closing ceremony.
[5190.76 - 5194.76] P:1670.64 E:0.113305 |  And by the way, if you're listening to us on the iPlayer now
[5194.76 - 5198.76] P:1669.71 E:0.115773 |  as part of the service where you can watch the BBC TV pictures,
[5198.76 - 5200.76] P:1576.94 E:0.114413 |  but you get our build-up,
[5200.76 - 5204.76] P:1628.52 E:0.119935 |  and then you will obviously get our commentary for the match
[5204.76 - 5205.76] P:1684.61 E:0.127551 |  for whatever reason.
[5205.76 - 5207.76] P:1595.19 E:0.120615 |  I don't know how these things work,
[5207.76 - 5212.76] P:1701.37 E:0.113381 |  but our feed of our build-up will disappear for six minutes
[5212.76 - 5214.76] P:1626.20 E:0.119250 |  and you'll get the closing ceremony.
[5214.76 - 5216.76] P:1652.99 E:0.110463 |  Don't worry about it in the end.
[5216.76 - 5218.76] P:1779.15 E:0.110581 |  You'll still get the commentary for the game,
[5218.76 - 5221.76] P:1699.80 E:0.119167 |  but the closing ceremony will replace our discussion
[5221.76 - 5225.76] P:1705.30 E:0.109733 |  for about six minutes.
[5225.76 - 5228.76] P:1716.68 E:0.112618 |  I want to just touch, and we're going to hear from Harry Kane
[5228.76 - 5231.76] P:1718.68 E:0.112400 |  in just a moment, on Alvaro Morata.
[5231.76 - 5235.76] P:1673.22 E:0.111355 |  And what do you think his personal determination is
[5235.76 - 5238.76] P:1726.60 E:0.115468 |  to ram a few words down a few people's throat tonight?
[5238.76 - 5241.76] P:1790.37 E:0.114510 |  We'll do that. No doubt about it.
[5241.76 - 5244.76] P:1786.45 E:0.111013 |  Everybody talks about him as the perfect leader,
[5244.76 - 5247.76] P:1843.64 E:0.109951 |  and mostly it's about what he does on the pitch
[5247.76 - 5249.76] P:1774.26 E:0.112364 |  that people may not realise.
[5249.76 - 5251.76] P:1906.44 E:0.111992 |  He's the forward of the whole tournament
[5251.76 - 5254.76] P:1750.02 E:0.108554 |  that makes more runs to defend.
[5254.76 - 5256.76] P:1753.28 E:0.104632 |  He's the one that's still the ball more often.
[5256.76 - 5259.76] P:1848.00 E:0.088404 |  He does a lot of things that perhaps are not in stats,
[5259.76 - 5262.76] P:1814.07 E:0.105169 |  but if he does it, everybody else is doing it.
[5262.76 - 5266.76] P:1793.92 E:0.106025 |  But his leadership gets seen perhaps weeks before the tournament
[5266.76 - 5269.76] P:1779.47 E:0.096513 |  when he embraces La Minhia Malware,
[5269.76 - 5272.76] P:1797.77 E:0.104709 |  he looks after them and he's always on the phone to them.
[5272.76 - 5275.76] P:1875.40 E:0.090760 |  That kind of thing, the other leader, of course, in Roderick,
[5275.76 - 5278.76] P:1760.46 E:0.105824 |  and that is the one that we'll just be telling everyone
[5278.76 - 5280.76] P:1754.03 E:0.104280 |  what to do on the pitch.
[5280.76 - 5283.76] P:1818.35 E:0.102666 |  That combination plus the martial in defence of La Porte,
[5283.76 - 5286.76] P:1735.42 E:0.101608 |  that's the axis in which the whole team is facing.
[5286.76 - 5290.76] P:1754.29 E:0.106245 |  What are his centre-hearts challenges do you think he's facing Morata?
[5290.76 - 5292.76] P:1754.51 E:0.108051 |  I think you've just got to be aware of him physically.
[5292.76 - 5294.76] P:1683.89 E:0.107306 |  I think he can be a problem when the ball's wide,
[5294.76 - 5297.76] P:1815.30 E:0.107007 |  certainly when La Mal's crossing the ball into that back post area.
[5297.76 - 5300.76] P:1827.78 E:0.107652 |  He will peel off and look to get his head on the end of it.
[5300.76 - 5303.76] P:1736.19 E:0.106704 |  He's very good at measuring those kind of runs.
[5303.76 - 5305.76] P:1831.19 E:0.104135 |  As Guillaume said, he makes very clever movements,
[5305.76 - 5309.76] P:1813.79 E:0.095848 |  and I think a lot of what he's done is to drag you out of a hole
[5309.76 - 5311.76] P:1856.85 E:0.102632 |  where it's unselfish.
[5311.76 - 5314.76] P:1748.23 E:0.102945 |  He might not benefit, but Daniomo will,
[5314.76 - 5317.76] P:1802.31 E:0.106561 |  or Roderick will arrive, or Nico Williams will pull in there.
[5317.76 - 5320.76] P:1830.78 E:0.104507 |  So I think there's a centre-half, you've got to really have one eye on.
[5320.76 - 5323.76] P:1800.35 E:0.105655 |  Do I need to drop into that, or step away from that space
[5323.76 - 5325.76] P:1783.16 E:0.096369 |  and vacate where I'm at?
[5325.76 - 5328.76] P:1751.97 E:0.091369 |  And that's a very tricky split-second decision you have to make as a centre-back.
[5328.76 - 5330.76] P:1670.91 E:0.102158 |  Does it help having a back-three then in that situation?
[5330.76 - 5333.76] P:1839.27 E:0.110709 |  Well, possibly yes, because you have a freedom with a back-three.
[5333.76 - 5335.76] P:1800.73 E:0.108820 |  We're one of you, whether it be central or wide,
[5335.76 - 5338.76] P:1883.08 E:0.102387 |  you've got the ability to lock in and go tight,
[5338.76 - 5341.76] P:1748.85 E:0.104593 |  because you've got one extra centre-back in that covering position.
[5341.76 - 5343.76] P:1809.03 E:0.104162 |  So that could suit England tonight,
[5343.76 - 5345.76] P:1756.34 E:0.105090 |  as they have that kind of hybrid shuffle.
[5345.76 - 5348.76] P:1828.76 E:0.107160 |  I expect him to be in a back-three quite frequently,
[5348.76 - 5350.76] P:1685.54 E:0.099880 |  and that may well help with Murata.
[5350.76 - 5353.76] P:1748.31 E:0.108520 |  Do you think they'll move out of a back-three, is he,
[5353.76 - 5355.76] P:1720.32 E:0.106697 |  England at times now?
[5355.76 - 5358.76] P:1788.21 E:0.107396 |  For example, when that substitution was made in the semi-final,
[5358.76 - 5360.76] P:1688.78 E:0.104479 |  when Luke Shaw came on for the second half,
[5360.76 - 5362.76] P:1788.85 E:0.110587 |  we thought the formation would stay the same,
[5362.76 - 5364.76] P:1632.08 E:0.095060 |  and yes, it didn't really.
[5364.76 - 5366.76] P:1750.55 E:0.109005 |  Yeah, I think that was more to do with the way
[5366.76 - 5369.76] P:1724.08 E:0.103340 |  that the Netherlands actually set up in the second half.
[5369.76 - 5372.76] P:1879.58 E:0.103183 |  They went into a more of a 4-4-2, and Luke Shaw, when he came on,
[5372.76 - 5374.76] P:1800.43 E:0.083582 |  the desired effect was to get him further forward
[5374.76 - 5376.76] P:1833.80 E:0.107768 |  and get him into those crossing areas,
[5376.76 - 5378.76] P:1716.01 E:0.099631 |  but I think he had to stay a little bit more back.
[5378.76 - 5382.76] P:1792.43 E:0.094967 |  But I think that the Cow Walker, you know, spoke about it there,
[5382.76 - 5386.76] P:1748.51 E:0.107440 |  with the comfort in John Stones having him next to him,
[5386.76 - 5389.76] P:1652.79 E:0.115906 |  and knowing that they've got the freedom to move when needed,
[5389.76 - 5392.76] P:1817.34 E:0.102630 |  but it all just depends on where the threat is,
[5392.76 - 5394.76] P:1829.29 E:0.096675 |  and they've got to make sure that if they do swing,
[5394.76 - 5397.76] P:1775.59 E:0.116228 |  if wing-backs do push on, or if full-backs do push on,
[5397.76 - 5399.76] P:1753.27 E:0.113804 |  the centre-backs and the covering of the field
[5399.76 - 5402.76] P:1851.37 E:0.110301 |  has to be so alert to just cover those spaces
[5402.76 - 5405.76] P:1916.77 E:0.100566 |  that we leave open when the ball turns over.
[5405.76 - 5407.76] P:1829.17 E:0.117819 |  We've spoken about Alvaro Morata,
[5407.76 - 5409.76] P:1641.30 E:0.120735 |  then let's talk about England's centre-board,
[5409.76 - 5413.76] P:1754.61 E:0.105175 |  England's captain Harry Kane, he's been talking to Ian.
[5413.76 - 5417.76] P:1788.60 E:0.090908 |  How are you feeling, because you're the first man to captain England
[5417.76 - 5419.76] P:1730.98 E:0.060902 |  in two finals? Some achievement.
[5419.76 - 5422.76] P:1625.75 E:0.077343 |  Yes, no, it's a great achievement,
[5422.76 - 5424.76] P:1604.76 E:0.082091 |  and one I'm extremely proud of,
[5424.76 - 5426.76] P:1613.37 E:0.059781 |  because, you know, being the captain, being a leader,
[5426.76 - 5428.76] P:1568.67 E:0.087110 |  it's an important responsibility to the team,
[5428.76 - 5432.76] P:1699.63 E:0.073933 |  and also the country as well, so, yeah, fantastic achievement,
[5432.76 - 5435.76] P:1548.66 E:0.065590 |  but ultimately, you know, I don't want to be the captain to lose
[5435.76 - 5438.76] P:1562.63 E:0.091584 |  two finals either, so I have the opportunity to try and put that right.
[5438.76 - 5441.76] P:1523.56 E:0.074729 |  There's a lot of excitement, there's a lot of nerves, of course,
[5441.76 - 5443.76] P:1597.12 E:0.067825 |  but, you know, once we're out on that pitch,
[5443.76 - 5445.76] P:1759.37 E:0.071562 |  it's just about giving everything for the badge, everything for the country,
[5445.76 - 5446.76] P:1832.00 E:0.056803 |  and we'll do that.
[5446.76 - 5448.76] P:1598.85 E:0.081537 |  Other than the result three years ago,
[5448.76 - 5450.76] P:1613.50 E:0.071946 |  is the one thing that you've learnt,
[5450.76 - 5452.76] P:1812.56 E:0.058402 |  and you're going to take from that defeat,
[5452.76 - 5454.76] P:1677.46 E:0.069778 |  and try and harness it and turn it into a positive?
[5454.76 - 5457.76] P:1720.78 E:0.079861 |  Well, I just think you take all past experiences.
[5457.76 - 5459.76] P:1742.27 E:0.090039 |  You know, I'm someone who always tries to look at positive things
[5459.76 - 5462.76] P:1732.77 E:0.073751 |  and use bad moments to help you in the future,
[5462.76 - 5465.76] P:1623.86 E:0.089242 |  and I think that a lot of the players who were in that final,
[5465.76 - 5468.76] P:1697.09 E:0.075608 |  you know, just know what to expect leading up to a final,
[5468.76 - 5470.76] P:1488.76 E:0.076349 |  there's a lot of media, there's a lot of fan attention,
[5470.76 - 5472.76] P:1369.54 E:0.058114 |  there's a lot of different things that go into it,
[5472.76 - 5474.76] P:1689.20 E:0.093538 |  and it's just about being calm,
[5474.76 - 5477.76] P:1616.45 E:0.066537 |  because, you know, there's nothing we can do until nine o'clock,
[5477.76 - 5479.76] P:1610.80 E:0.081756 |  just have to be relaxed and just be in the moment,
[5479.76 - 5481.76] P:1711.19 E:0.064815 |  we've prepared, it's just like every other game,
[5481.76 - 5484.76] P:1524.97 E:0.078215 |  you go into it with a belief that you can win,
[5484.76 - 5485.76] P:1163.21 E:0.045876 |  and that's what we're doing.
[5485.76 - 5487.76] P:1414.67 E:0.063074 |  But it's not like any other game, is it?
[5487.76 - 5489.76] P:1708.86 E:0.056883 |  Because it does have a different feel to it.
[5489.76 - 5491.76] P:1691.94 E:0.104068 |  Yeah, but, you know, every knockout game in a major tournament
[5491.76 - 5493.76] P:1770.71 E:0.074613 |  has that feel to it, because, you know,
[5493.76 - 5495.76] P:1485.26 E:0.094436 |  you're one game away from going home,
[5495.76 - 5497.76] P:1633.78 E:0.066216 |  and now we're at the stage where you're one game away from winning,
[5497.76 - 5501.76] P:1635.95 E:0.069848 |  and you're one game away from having a really tough loss,
[5501.76 - 5503.76] P:1889.56 E:0.079234 |  so of course there's more on it,
[5503.76 - 5505.76] P:1705.87 E:0.080628 |  but I think you try and block that out,
[5505.76 - 5508.76] P:1805.70 E:0.060746 |  you're more experienced, and just kind of focusing on what you can control,
[5508.76 - 5510.76] P:1889.37 E:0.070323 |  and that's, you know, your preparation,
[5510.76 - 5512.76] P:1678.67 E:0.069348 |  that's, you know, getting enough sleep,
[5512.76 - 5513.76] P:1776.13 E:0.082769 |  and all those types of things,
[5513.76 - 5516.76] P:1654.37 E:0.069968 |  and then a football game can go in many different ways,
[5516.76 - 5518.76] P:1769.30 E:0.069094 |  as we've seen in this tournament already,
[5518.76 - 5520.76] P:1579.03 E:0.090152 |  there can be highs and lows throughout the game,
[5520.76 - 5522.76] P:1560.70 E:0.080001 |  and we've dealt with that really well so far,
[5522.76 - 5523.76] P:1765.50 E:0.031320 |  and it will be no different.
[5523.76 - 5524.76] P:1646.03 E:0.074347 |  Have you dared to dream again?
[5524.76 - 5526.76] P:1848.19 E:0.069254 |  I know you'd have had those same dreams three years ago,
[5526.76 - 5529.76] P:1529.54 E:0.074226 |  or has that experience taught you not to think that far ahead?
[5529.76 - 5531.76] P:1749.98 E:0.106445 |  No, I think you, of course you think about it,
[5531.76 - 5533.76] P:1457.57 E:0.078069 |  I think we're just talking there, you know,
[5533.76 - 5535.76] P:1568.84 E:0.084553 |  I think Olly spoke about manifesting positive things,
[5535.76 - 5537.76] P:1741.35 E:0.072187 |  and I think it's important to, you know,
[5537.76 - 5538.76] P:1383.55 E:0.075291 |  say that you want to win it,
[5538.76 - 5540.76] P:1558.82 E:0.078321 |  and you know, I made that pretty clear back in 2018,
[5540.76 - 5542.76] P:1798.14 E:0.085376 |  when we, before the World Cup started,
[5542.76 - 5544.76] P:1666.92 E:0.076229 |  when no one gave us a chance,
[5544.76 - 5546.76] P:1597.09 E:0.080311 |  so I think you have to believe you can win,
[5546.76 - 5548.76] P:1548.46 E:0.082019 |  you have to think about what winning looks like,
[5548.76 - 5550.76] P:1619.89 E:0.076934 |  and how can you get there, and all those moments,
[5550.76 - 5552.76] P:1456.63 E:0.085491 |  and, you know, all that positive energy,
[5552.76 - 5555.76] P:1692.61 E:0.075807 |  and that belief is what sometimes pushes teams over the line,
[5555.76 - 5558.76] P:1733.69 E:0.070793 |  and we feel the belief is growing from the fans,
[5558.76 - 5560.76] P:1631.03 E:0.072055 |  and everyone involved, so, yeah, we need everyone,
[5560.76 - 5562.76] P:1711.13 E:0.065411 |  including the fans, to get us over the line,
[5562.76 - 5564.76] P:1822.58 E:0.072432 |  isn't it exciting, possibly?
[5565.76 - 5568.76] P:1908.61 E:0.111355 |  Harry Kane talking to Ian Dennis, how did you find him?
[5568.76 - 5571.76] P:1913.18 E:0.095035 |  I've got to say, found him very, very relaxed.
[5571.76 - 5574.76] P:1801.00 E:0.102441 |  In the press conference, there was a funny moment
[5574.76 - 5577.76] P:1714.83 E:0.092445 |  where a journalist asked that the two of them,
[5577.76 - 5580.76] P:1735.52 E:0.089172 |  him and Gareth Southgate, members of Euro 96,
[5580.76 - 5582.76] P:1845.31 E:0.103407 |  and equipped, well, Gareth, you better answer that,
[5582.76 - 5584.76] P:1921.25 E:0.099933 |  because you were around, I was only three,
[5584.76 - 5586.76] P:1813.00 E:0.103718 |  and then we came down into the tunnel area
[5586.76 - 5590.76] P:1819.70 E:0.098461 |  to do that interview, and we finished our interview
[5590.76 - 5592.76] P:1825.61 E:0.104181 |  a little earlier, and we just had two or three minutes
[5592.76 - 5595.76] P:1837.25 E:0.087903 |  just chatting off air, and I reminded him
[5595.76 - 5597.76] P:1913.04 E:0.102923 |  that England are unbeaten in this stadium.
[5597.76 - 5599.76] P:1866.02 E:0.074386 |  They've never lost six times here
[5599.76 - 5601.76] P:1911.28 E:0.101543 |  in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin.
[5601.76 - 5603.76] P:1974.68 E:0.098101 |  Last time, 2016, he scored.
[5603.76 - 5606.76] P:1998.39 E:0.100484 |  England came from 2-0 down to beat Germany by three goals
[5606.76 - 5608.76] P:1939.64 E:0.101799 |  for two, and Eric, we were reminiscing about that,
[5608.76 - 5610.76] P:1937.85 E:0.104509 |  and then we're also reminiscing about
[5610.76 - 5613.76] P:2009.22 E:0.096322 |  a Nations League encounter in Seville.
[5613.76 - 5616.76] P:1974.70 E:0.085332 |  Last time, that actually England played Spain.
[5616.76 - 5618.76] P:1975.12 E:0.102648 |  England were three up at halftime,
[5618.76 - 5621.76] P:2046.93 E:0.094875 |  and we were talking about Eric Dyer once again.
[5621.76 - 5623.76] P:1924.70 E:0.111485 |  He went into a sliding challenge
[5623.76 - 5625.76] P:1943.34 E:0.103159 |  very early on with Sergio Ramos.
[5625.76 - 5627.76] P:1980.39 E:0.103311 |  Very wet conditions, really wet night that night,
[5627.76 - 5629.76] P:1977.01 E:0.093399 |  and I thought that set the tone for an excellent
[5629.76 - 5632.76] P:1895.00 E:0.095867 |  England performance, and England went after Spain
[5632.76 - 5634.76] P:1964.31 E:0.094348 |  that night in the first half.
[5634.76 - 5636.76] P:1923.93 E:0.108785 |  As it turns out, they won 3-2, they were hanging on at the end,
[5636.76 - 5639.76] P:1979.55 E:0.094138 |  but if England do that tonight, it'll be interesting.
[5639.76 - 5643.76] P:1901.78 E:0.103384 |  Not the only player to score for England in this stadium, is he?
[5645.76 - 5647.76] P:1791.15 E:0.123226 |  Me? Yeah, I thought you were asking.
[5647.76 - 5649.76] P:1815.62 E:0.112357 |  I thought you were asking, is he, then?
[5649.76 - 5651.76] P:1772.00 E:0.116861 |  No, I was very fair.
[5651.76 - 5654.76] P:1836.03 E:0.105729 |  Well, I was asking Chris, I know that.
[5654.76 - 5659.76] P:1823.26 E:0.103133 |  Yeah, I topoked one home in that left hand goal over there.
[5659.76 - 5661.76] P:1796.90 E:0.084886 |  The 2-1 win.
[5661.76 - 5663.76] P:1837.36 E:0.101679 |  Chris has played in this stadium, though.
[5663.76 - 5665.76] P:1718.21 E:0.095247 |  I know. Yeah, I have, yeah.
[5665.76 - 5667.76] P:1676.08 E:0.089617 |  Fund memories, Chris.
[5667.76 - 5669.76] P:1621.70 E:0.102080 |  You put me away, didn't you?
[5669.76 - 5671.76] P:1768.88 E:0.108163 |  No, I didn't.
[5671.76 - 5674.76] P:1934.54 E:0.099775 |  He played for Chelsea against Hurtable in Champions League 1999,
[5674.76 - 5677.76] P:1885.22 E:0.105005 |  and I said, what happened in the other match at Stamford Bridge?
[5677.76 - 5680.76] P:1893.25 E:0.090304 |  He said, I can't remember. I said, you were sent off.
[5680.76 - 5683.76] P:1757.07 E:0.104509 |  It's unnecessary. It's all about positivity tonight.
[5683.76 - 5685.76] P:1878.38 E:0.106194 |  We're all in this together. Don't spoil the flow, then.
[5685.76 - 5687.76] P:1799.54 E:0.100406 |  Job, Barry. And on that theme, you know,
[5687.76 - 5690.76] P:1877.19 E:0.107043 |  we're talking about the Gareth Southgate human story.
[5690.76 - 5693.76] P:1921.84 E:0.107775 |  We really shouldn't forget about the Harry Kane human story,
[5693.76 - 5696.76] P:1992.14 E:0.103752 |  the fact that he's still trying to chase this first winners' medal,
[5696.76 - 5699.76] P:1917.20 E:0.108185 |  this first trophy of his career.
[5699.76 - 5703.76] P:1835.10 E:0.095818 |  You know, if that happens tonight for him, then, you know,
[5703.76 - 5706.76] P:1857.23 E:0.104148 |  I think we should certainly be donating a certain amount of time later
[5706.76 - 5708.76] P:1857.80 E:0.109155 |  in the evening to...
[5708.76 - 5710.76] P:1897.62 E:0.098582 |  He's finally managed to get this moment.
[5710.76 - 5713.76] P:1854.90 E:0.108183 |  Someone said to him actually in the media conference yesterday,
[5713.76 - 5717.76] P:1858.71 E:0.114714 |  Harry, would you exchange all of your various trophies and baubles
[5717.76 - 5721.76] P:1823.21 E:0.104485 |  that you've won, all your top scorer medals, accolades, etc.
[5721.76 - 5723.76] P:1846.88 E:0.109943 |  for one trophy?
[5723.76 - 5725.76] P:1810.38 E:0.107463 |  We said, yeah, for sure. Yeah.
[5725.76 - 5729.76] P:1795.01 E:0.116515 |  I did think that was a very strange question, really.
[5729.76 - 5732.76] P:1811.13 E:0.104506 |  I mean, is he... At this tournament,
[5732.76 - 5734.76] P:1839.93 E:0.115730 |  he's still in the running for the Golden Boot.
[5734.76 - 5737.76] P:1815.44 E:0.111014 |  He's the joint top scorer. There are loads of them on three.
[5737.76 - 5740.76] P:1828.21 E:0.109916 |  He's scored with his left, with his right and with his head.
[5740.76 - 5742.76] P:1786.81 E:0.111356 |  I know one of them was a penalty,
[5742.76 - 5744.76] P:1791.01 E:0.098791 |  and they've all been in the penalty area.
[5744.76 - 5748.76] P:1850.66 E:0.095283 |  His top speed in the tournament is 32 kilometres an hour.
[5748.76 - 5752.76] P:1822.38 E:0.103766 |  Yamal's is 32.1 kilometres an hour.
[5752.76 - 5756.76] P:1872.35 E:0.094238 |  There's a perception that he's not had a good tournament.
[5756.76 - 5760.76] P:1835.10 E:0.099442 |  Wow. And yet all of that would beg to differ.
[5760.76 - 5763.76] P:1866.53 E:0.094056 |  Yeah, I mean, that's interesting about the top speed
[5763.76 - 5766.76] P:1839.02 E:0.100197 |  in particular, because a lot of said, you know,
[5766.76 - 5768.76] P:1763.61 E:0.107773 |  he's not had the space to run into, he's dropping too deep,
[5768.76 - 5771.76] P:1876.73 E:0.098233 |  and I guarantee he wouldn't be running at 32 kilometres an hour
[5771.76 - 5774.76] P:1758.77 E:0.106499 |  to drop deep and receive the ball. That's far too quick.
[5774.76 - 5777.76] P:1851.19 E:0.098263 |  You need to be running at those sorts of speed into the channels.
[5777.76 - 5779.76] P:1882.80 E:0.105911 |  I mean, maybe it was in a high-pressure situation
[5779.76 - 5781.76] P:1825.17 E:0.102781 |  where he was pressing from the front or something,
[5781.76 - 5783.76] P:1821.30 E:0.109875 |  but nonetheless, that's impressive stats for his age
[5783.76 - 5786.76] P:1756.85 E:0.096639 |  and for the season he's had. I think that's quite cool.
[5786.76 - 5790.76] P:1880.90 E:0.100006 |  But it's fascinating, isn't it, that he could end up being the taunt.
[5790.76 - 5792.76] P:1839.47 E:0.098874 |  If he scores tonight, the tournament's top-goal scorer.
[5792.76 - 5794.76] P:1813.22 E:0.100483 |  After all the criticism that he's had,
[5794.76 - 5796.76] P:1763.50 E:0.103351 |  but himself in a similar way to Garas Southgate,
[5796.76 - 5799.76] P:1792.56 E:0.095836 |  he's just taking it on his chin, and he's dealt with it,
[5799.76 - 5801.76] P:1734.51 E:0.105894 |  and he's not listened to any of the critics,
[5801.76 - 5803.76] P:1726.11 E:0.100972 |  and he's just done what he does.
[5803.76 - 5806.76] P:1712.20 E:0.097881 |  And we spoke about Morata, obviously the Spain captain
[5806.76 - 5808.76] P:1728.26 E:0.113628 |  playing this sort of unselfish role.
[5808.76 - 5811.76] P:1875.34 E:0.098475 |  In fact, if you went through all the last six games for England
[5811.76 - 5814.76] P:1824.73 E:0.098682 |  and you could pick out, you know, clips of Harry Kane's unselfishness,
[5814.76 - 5817.76] P:1851.72 E:0.109292 |  I'm sure there'll be a lot of them, because his role, he knows,
[5817.76 - 5821.76] P:1787.59 E:0.106382 |  is to be there to score goals, and that's literally what he has to do.
[5821.76 - 5824.76] P:1735.05 E:0.109110 |  He has to occupy centre-backs, and just the name of Harry Kane,
[5824.76 - 5826.76] P:1790.00 E:0.100902 |  he's a threat to whoever's marking him.
[5826.76 - 5832.76] P:1748.87 E:0.112453 |  Yeah, the criticism of it, Mark, I've found it astonishing, really.
[5832.76 - 5835.76] P:1896.77 E:0.091951 |  The guys joined top scorer in the competition.
[5835.76 - 5838.76] P:1872.28 E:0.115205 |  I'm not saying he's been his very, very best.
[5838.76 - 5842.76] P:1887.82 E:0.100260 |  I don't think that he has offered a big enough threat in behind,
[5842.76 - 5845.76] P:1932.29 E:0.109293 |  but the onus isn't just on him to offer that threat.
[5845.76 - 5849.76] P:1790.34 E:0.110834 |  It's on Sackers, on Bellingham, it's on Foden, it's on other players as well.
[5849.76 - 5852.76] P:1803.03 E:0.100586 |  We know what Harry Kane's strengths are as a centre-forward.
[5852.76 - 5854.76] P:1890.39 E:0.110514 |  He's a brilliant finisher.
[5854.76 - 5859.76] P:1905.65 E:0.112061 |  Has he been given enough opportunities in this tournament so far?
[5859.76 - 5861.76] P:1871.38 E:0.116167 |  No, he hasn't, but what do we know tonight?
[5861.76 - 5865.76] P:1873.17 E:0.112295 |  If there is half a chance, you wouldn't want anybody else on that pitch
[5865.76 - 5868.76] P:1787.98 E:0.112053 |  to be striding on it and trying to take it.
[5868.76 - 5872.76] P:1873.87 E:0.114494 |  Harry Kane, over the years, has been a phenomenal finisher.
[5872.76 - 5876.76] P:1729.63 E:0.110387 |  He still is, he hasn't lost it, give him chances, he'll score.
[5876.76 - 5880.76] P:1731.19 E:0.102914 |  Don't you think that he's been one of the players that's had to adapt the most
[5880.76 - 5884.76] P:1691.80 E:0.112893 |  to Garry Southgate trying to get Bellingham and Foden into the team?
[5884.76 - 5889.76] P:1766.57 E:0.115969 |  Do you not think that he really has had to change his game up a little bit, Chris,
[5889.76 - 5893.76] P:1942.33 E:0.118485 |  because he can't go into areas where normally he'd be very comfortable?
[5893.76 - 5898.76] P:1974.32 E:0.109443 |  Yeah, I think he's at the age now where it's just a habit,
[5898.76 - 5902.76] P:1736.38 E:0.105182 |  the fact that he wants to always drop in and drop deep.
[5902.76 - 5904.76] P:1863.64 E:0.113826 |  That's why I get the best out of him as well, don't I?
[5904.76 - 5908.76] P:1818.34 E:0.108339 |  Absolutely, and he always needs those runners off him,
[5908.76 - 5913.76] P:1876.77 E:0.112734 |  but when he does get on the half-turn, there's hardly a better passer in the England team,
[5913.76 - 5916.76] P:1909.25 E:0.118724 |  and he's so accurate with his passing so good at his link-up play,
[5916.76 - 5921.76] P:1878.35 E:0.115980 |  but he doesn't offer him behind enough, but we know the reason for that.
[5921.76 - 5926.76] P:1914.10 E:0.114306 |  What did the Scottish media make of everything to do with Kane?
[5926.76 - 5930.76] P:1973.09 E:0.113592 |  We've been praying and using our context to see if Kane was on the bench
[5930.76 - 5934.76] P:1863.14 E:0.110718 |  for tonight's game, as it happened by the looks of it.
[5934.76 - 5937.76] P:1999.69 E:0.106746 |  It goes back to the expectations.
[5937.76 - 5941.76] P:2055.27 E:0.097448 |  You've got players that are so famous, such big names,
[5941.76 - 5944.76] P:1964.03 E:0.097453 |  some of them the best in the competitions they're playing,
[5944.76 - 5947.76] P:1893.62 E:0.089150 |  that not only you expect them to play, they've got to shine.
[5947.76 - 5951.76] P:1812.47 E:0.095378 |  And sometimes Matthew was saying this, balance is absolutely crucial,
[5951.76 - 5953.76] P:1905.80 E:0.109950 |  it's not easy to find it.
[5953.76 - 5956.76] P:1853.85 E:0.100398 |  I don't think England have found it, it's a team of moments,
[5956.76 - 5960.76] P:1826.22 E:0.102216 |  but I've got players like Kane that can bring those moments forward.
[5960.76 - 5962.76] P:1896.31 E:0.108061 |  Do you think it's also easy?
[5962.76 - 5968.76] P:1835.04 E:0.111307 |  It helps that there's an acceptance,
[5968.76 - 5972.76] P:1808.38 E:0.108613 |  even that after an hour, after 70 minutes,
[5972.76 - 5976.76] P:1857.74 E:0.115316 |  if there's a change to be made and it needs to be a change-up from,
[5976.76 - 5979.76] P:1913.07 E:0.113458 |  then that's what England are going to do.
[5979.76 - 5985.76] P:1833.53 E:0.102438 |  Without a doubt, I think this is the biggest opportunity ever for England.
[5985.76 - 5987.76] P:1852.42 E:0.111281 |  To create this new history,
[5987.76 - 5991.76] P:1787.10 E:0.104857 |  and Galshouse will need to make some bold decisions on that touchline,
[5991.76 - 5994.76] P:1846.87 E:0.114740 |  but he's very well placed, very well quick to do that.
[5994.76 - 5997.76] P:1808.57 E:0.106604 |  He can turn over his shoulder and look at the bench that he's got,
[5997.76 - 6001.76] P:1911.50 E:0.112834 |  and he's got a plethora of talent, he's got players that he can turn to.
[6001.76 - 6004.76] P:1794.12 E:0.113114 |  He's also got a sense of unpredictability about it,
[6004.76 - 6006.76] P:1825.09 E:0.118015 |  because you would have thought in the previous game,
[6006.76 - 6008.76] P:1773.04 E:0.110346 |  you would have thought maybe Ivan Tony's going to come on
[6008.76 - 6010.76] P:1723.20 E:0.109495 |  after he scored the penalty against Switzerland.
[6010.76 - 6012.76] P:1780.29 E:0.114023 |  No, no, no, he looked at Oli Watkins,
[6012.76 - 6014.76] P:1802.81 E:0.110447 |  and Oli Watkins only needed five minutes.
[6014.76 - 6017.76] P:1761.65 E:0.105489 |  He produced in the moment, and who knows who Galsythgate's going to turn to,
[6017.76 - 6022.76] P:1804.05 E:0.113349 |  but I think if the game needs it, he will have to take Harry Kane off,
[6022.76 - 6025.76] P:1683.93 E:0.099313 |  because he knows he's got the strength on the bench.
[6026.76 - 6029.76] P:1776.48 E:0.116947 |  Yeah, I mean, he's shown that he's willing to make that decision,
[6029.76 - 6034.76] P:1684.59 E:0.108891 |  when he needs to make a change that benefits the outcome for the team,
[6034.76 - 6036.76] P:1664.07 E:0.124126 |  he'll make it regardless of who you are,
[6036.76 - 6039.76] P:1834.02 E:0.117299 |  whether you're captain, whether you're the lead, goal scorer,
[6039.76 - 6041.76] P:1807.02 E:0.115370 |  whoever it needs to be, and I think it has to be that way.
[6041.76 - 6045.76] P:1776.20 E:0.114928 |  You have to make the right call at the right moment that benefits the team.
[6046.76 - 6051.76] P:1720.43 E:0.126895 |  It's no doubt Oli Watkins is a different type of centre forwards to Harry Kane.
[6051.76 - 6054.76] P:1662.17 E:0.111257 |  We saw that within, I think, a minute of him coming on.
[6054.76 - 6058.76] P:1644.11 E:0.120257 |  He makes those runs in behind, which Kane isn't so good at.
[6058.76 - 6062.76] P:1700.38 E:0.115936 |  I'm not so sure about the speed stat on Harry Kane, where they got that from.
[6062.76 - 6066.76] P:1792.21 E:0.117588 |  Maybe a tachyric, maybe he had the win behind him on that particular occasion.
[6066.76 - 6070.76] P:1912.11 E:0.115129 |  But Oli Watkins does offer that greater threat in behind,
[6070.76 - 6073.76] P:1882.49 E:0.117743 |  and that's something Gareth I'm sure we'll be thinking about,
[6073.76 - 6078.76] P:1877.25 E:0.114464 |  because it's also about Kuta Rea as being a possible weakness for Spain,
[6078.76 - 6084.76] P:1915.55 E:0.116831 |  but I'm not so sure the centre half of Spain are blessed with real great pace.
[6085.76 - 6089.76] P:1869.53 E:0.125579 |  It's true, it's not only true, you actually have got a team that will defend so high,
[6089.76 - 6091.76] P:1886.27 E:0.113723 |  the highest in the competition,
[6091.76 - 6094.76] P:1920.98 E:0.108537 |  that if you beat that pressure, as Salged said,
[6094.76 - 6098.76] P:1659.22 E:0.103116 |  it will be a terrible thing to the fan, and we're not the fastest going back either.
[6098.76 - 6102.76] P:1837.25 E:0.107714 |  That's your chance, that is one of the opportunities for England, as Francis Rubin.
[6102.76 - 6106.76] P:1700.14 E:0.113571 |  How important, when you are around the England Campion,
[6106.76 - 6109.76] P:1733.37 E:0.120692 |  or John, you've probably been around the England Campion
[6109.76 - 6117.76] P:1764.11 E:0.117142 |  during this tournament, how important is his leadership with this group?
[6119.76 - 6121.76] P:1772.48 E:0.116672 |  Sorry, who are we talking about?
[6121.76 - 6123.76] P:1956.34 E:0.122080 |  Harry Kane, John.
[6123.76 - 6125.76] P:1920.84 E:0.121427 |  I'm struggling to actually do that.
[6125.76 - 6126.76] P:1845.65 E:0.111313 |  The England captain?
[6126.76 - 6128.76] P:1814.82 E:0.108576 |  Yeah, do you know him?
[6128.76 - 6130.76] P:1886.66 E:0.116468 |  I'm just struggling to...
[6130.76 - 6133.76] P:1921.69 E:0.127342 |  Leoni was drowning you out there, believe it or not.
[6135.76 - 6141.76] P:1976.81 E:0.114000 |  I would say that he is the classic lead-by-example man,
[6141.76 - 6145.76] P:2090.80 E:0.117782 |  and the number of goals that he scored, he's just been so reliable.
[6145.76 - 6151.76] P:2050.04 E:0.109572 |  I think, I mean, the number of previews that I've done for this match
[6151.76 - 6153.76] P:2076.52 E:0.116538 |  during the course of the last few days,
[6153.76 - 6157.76] P:2006.16 E:0.114702 |  almost every single person has asked me about leaving Harry Kane
[6157.76 - 6159.76] P:1915.94 E:0.113143 |  out of the team for the final,
[6159.76 - 6163.76] P:1926.81 E:0.115505 |  and I've just responded with some of the things you were saying about him earlier
[6163.76 - 6167.76] P:1966.32 E:0.115989 |  in terms of the numbers, and also the fact that he scored 15 goals
[6167.76 - 6169.76] P:1788.59 E:0.108542 |  in his last 19 England internationals,
[6169.76 - 6173.76] P:1775.84 E:0.110267 |  and all of that is leading by example,
[6173.76 - 6177.76] P:1724.51 E:0.108340 |  and he's looked up to by so many members of the squad.
[6177.76 - 6179.76] P:1717.21 E:0.114147 |  He's a class act, isn't he?
[6179.76 - 6182.76] P:1827.33 E:0.113819 |  But you touched before about making those changes off the bench,
[6182.76 - 6184.76] P:1918.59 E:0.118110 |  and we do have to give a little nod to the fact
[6184.76 - 6190.76] P:1932.37 E:0.117803 |  that England have a fantastic ability to bring players on to impact the game.
[6190.76 - 6193.76] P:1935.13 E:0.120576 |  We've done that magnificently well in this tournament.
[6193.76 - 6198.76] P:1861.80 E:0.118798 |  Garry Southgate has now started to time those substitutions almost to perfection,
[6198.76 - 6202.76] P:1952.17 E:0.112911 |  and I think that could be a real asset in this game as it goes on.
[6202.76 - 6206.76] P:1876.39 E:0.125816 |  I think somebody said a couple of days ago to me,
[6206.76 - 6211.76] P:1870.64 E:0.117006 |  Harry Kane could never score the type of goal Ollie Watkins scored.
[6211.76 - 6215.76] P:1917.90 E:0.117798 |  You look at Harry Kane's career as a finisher.
[6215.76 - 6219.76] P:1956.66 E:0.120845 |  You can argue Ollie Watkins is a player who couldn't score the type of goal
[6219.76 - 6223.76] P:1976.72 E:0.118185 |  as Harry Kane scores, you know, his numbers are phenomenal,
[6223.76 - 6227.76] P:1879.44 E:0.110897 |  and John's right, in terms of goals, he's missed a consistency.
[6227.76 - 6230.76] P:1781.98 E:0.114989 |  You cannot think about dropping in.
[6230.76 - 6233.76] P:1896.93 E:0.108821 |  Well, you could also argue that Ollie Watkins, Chris,
[6233.76 - 6235.76] P:1882.80 E:0.113082 |  gets the chance to score that type of goal
[6235.76 - 6239.76] P:1871.04 E:0.108403 |  because Harry Kane has tired out the defenders for an hour,
[6239.76 - 6242.76] P:1840.12 E:0.113111 |  72 minutes before he comes on, couldn't he?
[6242.76 - 6246.76] P:1905.15 E:0.110686 |  At the time, Matt's touched on it, I thought it was really strong management,
[6246.76 - 6250.76] P:1883.62 E:0.105789 |  not an easy decision to make to bring your captain off a finisher like him,
[6250.76 - 6253.76] P:1832.46 E:0.110497 |  but it was about in that moment, that feeling from Garry Southgate
[6253.76 - 6256.76] P:1820.93 E:0.105621 |  that that's an area where England could exploit,
[6256.76 - 6259.76] P:1888.77 E:0.109991 |  and also Cole Palmer playing the pass, that worked really well,
[6259.76 - 6264.76] P:1844.57 E:0.105947 |  and that will give Garry's confidence tonight that if it isn't quite working with Harry Kane,
[6264.76 - 6268.76] P:1873.72 E:0.107171 |  maybe we'll see Ollie Watkins come on even earlier.
[6268.76 - 6271.76] P:1897.87 E:0.110846 |  I've just noticed that Garry Southgate and Luis Del Apprente
[6271.76 - 6274.76] P:1919.81 E:0.111618 |  have already emerged, they've already walked up the steps there,
[6274.76 - 6277.76] P:1896.52 E:0.104349 |  and actually together on the carpet,
[6277.76 - 6280.76] P:1876.86 E:0.102725 |  they had a big embrace, the two of them, and a few words together
[6280.76 - 6282.76] P:1909.28 E:0.109926 |  before they went to their dugouts.
[6282.76 - 6285.76] P:1796.98 E:0.106879 |  Wow, they probably didn't want to miss a second of that closing ceremony.
[6285.76 - 6292.76] P:1857.66 E:0.106471 |  Are we expecting Guillem for this to be spanned to dominate
[6292.76 - 6295.76] P:1911.89 E:0.109095 |  and England to look for moments?
[6295.76 - 6297.76] P:1844.78 E:0.096918 |  Because that's the pattern of the tournament.
[6297.76 - 6302.76] P:1842.08 E:0.106259 |  And because the only way for us to do damage is to actually play the way that we play.
[6302.76 - 6304.76] P:1777.93 E:0.114861 |  We will have the ball, we will play good football,
[6304.76 - 6308.76] P:1870.47 E:0.107593 |  we've got the midfielders to do that, we've got the wingers to do, to do hurt,
[6308.76 - 6312.76] P:1789.54 E:0.103514 |  but yes, there will be perhaps at the end the feeling that,
[6312.76 - 6318.76] P:1755.21 E:0.111308 |  oh, a spanned play where England won, or a spanned play where, well, and a spanned one,
[6318.76 - 6321.76] P:1854.72 E:0.113779 |  but it's all to do with those moments, and you've got the quality of the players,
[6321.76 - 6324.76] P:1801.93 E:0.106519 |  better quality than we have.
[6324.76 - 6330.76] P:1805.34 E:0.120503 |  And Giorgio Chiellini is just bringing out the men's European Championship trophy.
[6330.76 - 6336.76] P:1746.16 E:0.112577 |  Got the Spanish ribbons on one side, the English ribbons on the other.
[6336.76 - 6342.76] P:1741.93 E:0.115187 |  He actually arrived in the car park around the same time as we did at the stadium.
[6342.76 - 6346.76] P:1822.00 E:0.118276 |  I did wonder whether he maybe would have two-footed Chris just for a whole time's sake
[6346.76 - 6349.76] P:1832.89 E:0.114370 |  because he got out of the van, he didn't.
[6349.76 - 6354.76] P:1781.83 E:0.111984 |  You're sort of in a fog of smoke down there at the moment because of the fireworks.
[6354.76 - 6358.76] P:1852.14 E:0.109783 |  Yeah, I didn't know whether I'd be describing the smells as much during the tournament,
[6358.76 - 6362.76] P:1867.65 E:0.106615 |  but I actually quite like the smell that's been left from all the pyrotechnics,
[6362.76 - 6366.76] P:1878.20 E:0.106663 |  and the multicoloured, I don't know what they were, that flew up into the sky
[6366.76 - 6373.76] P:1874.64 E:0.107037 |  has left the most incredible image that myself and one of the social media guys, Sam, next to me,
[6373.76 - 6376.76] P:1827.15 E:0.110374 |  has taken some fantastic pictures for five live.
[6376.76 - 6379.76] P:1863.49 E:0.114899 |  Looks absolutely magnificent.
[6379.76 - 6386.76] P:1840.47 E:0.120148 |  And it looks magnificent from down there, and this famous, famous old stadium
[6386.76 - 6392.76] P:1873.52 E:0.113260 |  with so much history behind it, both good and bad, rises to its feet
[6392.76 - 6399.76] P:1801.05 E:0.114701 |  as both teams come out of the tunnel, led by their two-strikeers, Alvaro Morata
[6399.76 - 6403.76] P:1881.97 E:0.110826 |  and Spain in their red tracksuit tops away to our left.
[6403.76 - 6409.76] P:1922.67 E:0.109854 |  And Harry Kane in his white tracksuit top, and white shores and white socks to our right.
[6409.76 - 6415.76] P:1811.66 E:0.109595 |  And they come together now next to the officials, and the mascots as well in front of them.
[6415.76 - 6419.76] P:1717.73 E:0.116223 |  Kane holding a white penance as well as is Alvaro Morata.
[6419.76 - 6426.76] P:1729.70 E:0.109961 |  They've walked past their flags, and behind them, giant replicas of the two shirts
[6426.76 - 6432.76] P:1766.16 E:0.112227 |  are fluttered by some of the volunteers here in Berlin.
[6432.76 - 6438.76] P:1734.82 E:0.108779 |  As we rise to our feet for the national anthems, starting with England.

[6551.04 - 6554.52] P:1597.15 E:0.120621 |  And as both sets of players applaud
[6554.52 - 6557.64] P:1749.02 E:0.112565 |  the stadium and all the various bits of paraphernalia,
[6557.64 - 6561.32] P:1593.13 E:0.113393 |  the big white flag that covers the pitch for the closing ceremony,
[6561.32 - 6566.00] P:1603.06 E:0.116304 |  being wrapped up, all the flags being taken off by the volunteers.
[6566.00 - 6569.32] P:1569.85 E:0.116454 |  And both sets of players shake hands,
[6569.32 - 6573.76] P:1633.02 E:0.117144 |  inward going along the line to shake the hands of their Spanish counterparts,
[6573.76 - 6577.60] P:1662.08 E:0.110139 |  and then they will get ready for their team photos,
[6577.60 - 6580.52] P:1548.22 E:0.118156 |  and then we will be ready to go.
[6580.52 - 6586.84] P:1496.94 E:0.117065 |  It is the men's European Championship Final involving England.
[6586.84 - 6592.72] P:1551.90 E:0.115297 |  Never before have we been able to say we've been here before.
[6592.72 - 6595.24] P:1640.25 E:0.119126 |  I wonder whether the outcome will be different.
[6595.24 - 6600.28] P:1582.94 E:0.116933 |  Our commentary team, Izzy Christiansen, Matt Upton, Chris Sutton,
[6600.28 - 6603.88] P:1759.07 E:0.103580 |  John Murray, and first of all, Ian Dennis.
[6603.88 - 6607.00] P:1826.64 E:0.104258 |  Thank you, Mark. Well, Garis Southgate says...
[6607.00 - 6611.48] P:1744.32 E:0.108377 |  He's not a believer in fairy tales, but a believer in dreams.
[6611.48 - 6614.36] P:1842.00 E:0.107809 |  But he also says we have to make it happen.
[6614.36 - 6617.16] P:1764.05 E:0.110793 |  And Spain, the best team in the tournament,
[6617.16 - 6619.32] P:1822.06 E:0.106469 |  stand in England's way.
[6619.32 - 6621.76] P:1728.42 E:0.114179 |  And they have made two changes,
[6621.76 - 6625.20] P:1708.54 E:0.115996 |  as Carvajal and Leynor-Mand are back from suspension
[6625.20 - 6628.32] P:1717.72 E:0.110418 |  to replace Nabas and also Nacho.
[6628.32 - 6632.84] P:1793.21 E:0.113702 |  So Simon is in goal, Carvajal, Leynor-Mand, Le Port and Cucaraya,
[6632.92 - 6639.16] P:1674.92 E:0.109317 |  and midfield of Rodgerie, Fabian, Olmo, and then LaMigna Mal.
[6639.16 - 6645.08] P:1775.58 E:0.111170 |  The youngest-ever player to play in a major final at 17 years and a day,
[6645.08 - 6648.16] P:1746.59 E:0.106995 |  Nico Williams and Alvaro Marata.
[6648.16 - 6651.48] P:1719.81 E:0.110335 |  England have made one change from the team that beat the Netherlands,
[6651.48 - 6655.72] P:1841.28 E:0.109566 |  and that is Luke Shaw coming in for his first England start
[6655.72 - 6661.40] P:1799.72 E:0.113616 |  in 391 days since he played against North Macedonia last year.
[6661.44 - 6667.12] P:1860.21 E:0.109464 |  His last start in football was back in February at Kenilworth Road.
[6667.12 - 6671.68] P:1867.93 E:0.109924 |  What a contrast from Kenilworth Road to this iconic stadium.
[6671.68 - 6673.64] P:1747.00 E:0.106639 |  Pickford in goal for England.
[6673.64 - 6676.44] P:1840.01 E:0.110677 |  Walker-Stones and Gehe is the back three.
[6676.44 - 6679.60] P:1817.74 E:0.100793 |  Saka and Shaw are the wing-backs.
[6679.60 - 6683.64] P:1843.47 E:0.104764 |  Rice, Maynou, who is actually the English...
[6683.64 - 6686.84] P:1815.68 E:0.111420 |  England's youngest-ever player to play in a major final.
[6686.84 - 6692.64] P:1658.89 E:0.110751 |  The Manchester United teenager, Foden, Bellingham and Harry Kane.
[6693.92 - 6696.60] P:1829.89 E:0.114232 |  Chris Sutton. What a setting.
[6697.96 - 6699.52] P:1872.95 E:0.118756 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[6700.36 - 6702.44] P:1808.32 E:0.117086 |  They have destiny for both teams,
[6702.44 - 6705.64] P:1876.39 E:0.110226 |  and they both have different journeys to get to this stage,
[6705.64 - 6707.52] P:1690.41 E:0.105830 |  to get to the final.
[6707.52 - 6712.92] P:1842.81 E:0.113342 |  England have had to fight and graft, have had moments of quality.
[6713.76 - 6715.64] P:1826.27 E:0.118735 |  But they're here, and the Spanish team,
[6715.64 - 6719.24] P:1785.58 E:0.112518 |  I think they've been superior to every other team in this tournament.
[6719.24 - 6722.24] P:1815.72 E:0.116027 |  They've been slick the way that they've performed.
[6722.24 - 6725.24] P:1786.66 E:0.118477 |  They've been swashbuckling really easy on the eye.
[6726.36 - 6729.36] P:1808.55 E:0.126043 |  England have got to really raise their level tonight
[6729.36 - 6732.44] P:1845.10 E:0.114403 |  and hit a level they haven't found in this tournament so far,
[6732.44 - 6734.76] P:1859.62 E:0.109257 |  but what do we know? They're capable.
[6734.76 - 6737.12] P:1900.02 E:0.111261 |  They have the players who are capable.
[6737.12 - 6739.84] P:1678.06 E:0.118158 |  They just need to knit everything together tonight
[6739.84 - 6742.88] P:1830.05 E:0.115133 |  and cause the Spanish team a threat or two.
[6742.92 - 6745.96] P:1824.99 E:0.120106 |  We welcome listeners to the BBC World Service,
[6745.96 - 6749.40] P:1806.35 E:0.115013 |  wherever you are in the world, it's a pleasure to have you company,
[6749.40 - 6755.56] P:1855.75 E:0.107366 |  as we're about to kick off the first men's overseas final for England,
[6755.56 - 6764.92] P:1820.95 E:0.108250 |  a day of destiny, 57 years and 350 days after the 1966 World Cup triumph.
[6765.76 - 6769.40] P:1869.71 E:0.112431 |  A nation hopes, a nation prays.
[6769.40 - 6771.48] P:1839.42 E:0.114672 |  Does it expect Matt Upton?
[6771.52 - 6773.92] P:1865.66 E:0.115790 |  Of course it does. Of course it expects,
[6773.92 - 6776.64] P:1766.67 E:0.115457 |  and that has been the theme through the whole tournament.
[6776.64 - 6781.08] P:1727.30 E:0.110463 |  That's why it's been such a bumpy ride for Garry Southgate and his players,
[6781.08 - 6782.48] P:1696.71 E:0.111037 |  and they've stood up to that challenge.
[6782.48 - 6785.40] P:1575.86 E:0.109657 |  Now is a massive, massive test.
[6785.40 - 6788.00] P:1736.97 E:0.114190 |  Will the grit and the heart of this England team
[6788.00 - 6791.64] P:1736.56 E:0.118026 |  be able to produce an iconic result?
[6791.64 - 6797.20] P:1765.23 E:0.113393 |  Or will this well-oiled, smooth Spanish machine just wipe us away?
[6798.20 - 6800.16] P:1783.45 E:0.120606 |  England are all in white.
[6800.16 - 6804.48] P:1746.41 E:0.114121 |  They are playing from left to right as we look against the Spain side,
[6804.48 - 6807.64] P:1744.93 E:0.110897 |  that has their red shirt, the navy blue shorts,
[6807.64 - 6810.88] P:1811.07 E:0.107945 |  and that little flash of yellow down the side.
[6810.88 - 6815.00] P:1726.27 E:0.111245 |  And when we mentioned a warm welcome to the BBC World Service,
[6815.00 - 6817.72] P:1718.91 E:0.111722 |  should also welcome, as well, to those listening,
[6817.72 - 6821.12] P:1770.75 E:0.107294 |  to the British Forces Broadcasting Service,
[6821.12 - 6824.00] P:1816.87 E:0.109306 |  who are taking our five live commentary here tonight,
[6824.00 - 6826.04] P:1735.04 E:0.100580 |  whether you're on an RAF base,
[6826.08 - 6829.24] P:1696.52 E:0.115984 |  a Royal Navy ship, or a Trooper Broad.
[6829.24 - 6830.72] P:1671.27 E:0.099971 |  Welcome.
[6830.72 - 6833.84] P:1719.60 E:0.104428 |  And good luck.
[6833.84 - 6837.24] P:1739.28 E:0.103882 |  Our Spain, with Le Normand at the back,
[6837.24 - 6841.08] P:1731.69 E:0.116261 |  just passes the ball square to Le Porte.
[6841.08 - 6844.00] P:1798.04 E:0.120886 |  Le Porte, who missed the opening game here against Croatia,
[6844.00 - 6847.40] P:1810.47 E:0.103306 |  but has played in every other game since, out towards your mouth,
[6847.40 - 6849.28] P:1892.05 E:0.108456 |  and held up by Shaw.
[6849.28 - 6851.76] P:1854.37 E:0.110072 |  And Shaw now to Baligam able to turn.
[6851.76 - 6855.52] P:1875.65 E:0.105717 |  Shaw gets forward in around 10 seconds' time.
[6855.52 - 6859.20] P:1849.68 E:0.105550 |  You think back to three years ago, it was around that moment
[6859.20 - 6861.84] P:1849.80 E:0.102864 |  that he was giving England the lead against Italy.
[6861.84 - 6863.32] P:1843.08 E:0.097571 |  Yeah, it was.
[6863.32 - 6867.60] P:1756.73 E:0.111135 |  He's going to have to make sure he's up to the task this evening.
[6867.60 - 6870.40] P:1803.69 E:0.117695 |  What a test he's got with your mouth,
[6870.40 - 6873.60] P:1830.36 E:0.118692 |  and that head-to-head duel actually looks like England.
[6873.60 - 6878.04] P:1742.69 E:0.111302 |  We spoke about before England, a bit of a hybrid model,
[6878.04 - 6882.88] P:1817.02 E:0.115569 |  at the moment they're at a flat back four.
[6882.92 - 6887.16] P:1783.70 E:0.120055 |  One thing we're not trying to allow is Spain to get any real control.
[6887.16 - 6889.76] P:1797.86 E:0.110499 |  It's going to be difficult.
[6889.76 - 6892.36] P:1815.70 E:0.117241 |  Should also say, this game is live on BBC One,
[6892.36 - 6895.88] P:1720.02 E:0.107618 |  and through the television, you do have that facility
[6895.88 - 6900.64] P:1792.18 E:0.113645 |  to go to the iPlayer and the Euros channel to listen to our commentary
[6900.64 - 6904.88] P:1782.74 E:0.110432 |  and watch with the pitchers automatically synced up as well,
[6904.88 - 6909.36] P:1806.06 E:0.109024 |  if you so wish, as there is still a haze from the pyrotechnics
[6909.44 - 6913.72] P:1750.71 E:0.110716 |  that is just loitered inside this bowl-like arena,
[6913.72 - 6917.00] P:1802.02 E:0.116038 |  where the bulk of the Spanish support is away towards our right,
[6917.00 - 6918.16] P:1876.92 E:0.091994 |  the red shirts.
[6918.16 - 6920.40] P:1821.29 E:0.109885 |  There is a lot of white shirts, but equally,
[6920.40 - 6924.24] P:1804.67 E:0.112837 |  I've seen a number of German supporters wearing their white shirts over here.
[6924.24 - 6927.36] P:1731.26 E:0.108408 |  So it does look like the English are outnumbering
[6927.36 - 6930.56] P:1791.31 E:0.106565 |  their Spanish counterparts significantly,
[6930.56 - 6933.40] P:1801.63 E:0.112364 |  which no doubt is the case, as the England supporters
[6933.40 - 6936.20] P:1877.62 E:0.107501 |  with just so many St George's flags,
[6936.20 - 6938.36] P:1694.80 E:0.101928 |  straight here, there and everywhere,
[6938.36 - 6941.92] P:1745.70 E:0.107690 |  but the main England support is to our left-hand side,
[6941.92 - 6944.68] P:1844.51 E:0.097031 |  where there's that gap in the stadium, the Marathon gate,
[6944.68 - 6948.00] P:1830.41 E:0.108222 |  in this iconic arena that holds 71,000,
[6948.00 - 6951.12] P:1754.10 E:0.100124 |  and our referee is Francois L'etecte,
[6951.12 - 6956.04] P:1774.71 E:0.102362 |  from France, as Walker made his debut against Spain
[6956.04 - 6958.56] P:1720.94 E:0.108075 |  back in 2011, clear as long,
[6958.56 - 6960.92] P:1738.83 E:0.112168 |  and Léonard Mande brings them to control.
[6960.92 - 6962.76] P:1864.07 E:0.112883 |  Noutreaux's had a good start to the game.
[6962.76 - 6965.28] P:1720.41 E:0.115041 |  He's won his first one-on-one duel with your mouth,
[6965.28 - 6968.28] P:1806.51 E:0.107794 |  tried to come inside, and he's just nicked it again off Marathe.
[6968.68 - 6970.48] P:1938.67 E:0.118816 |  He looks like he's bright and up to it,
[6970.48 - 6974.12] P:1751.55 E:0.110371 |  and really taking up good positions in that left-back slot at the moment,
[6974.12 - 6976.44] P:1834.67 E:0.107970 |  like Chris mentioned, in a flat-back four.
[6976.44 - 6980.08] P:1856.40 E:0.106669 |  Yamal comes inside, Carvajal is ahead of him.
[6980.08 - 6984.84] P:1876.66 E:0.107798 |  But Bellingham back there takes it away from his realm-adrift teammate.
[6984.84 - 6986.72] P:1867.80 E:0.115903 |  Spain will quickly win the ball back.
[6986.72 - 6989.40] P:1813.73 E:0.096438 |  That's something that we've talked about.
[6989.40 - 6992.00] P:1800.59 E:0.104232 |  They're attacking prowess.
[6992.00 - 6993.88] P:1902.23 E:0.103869 |  They're exciting wingers.
[6993.88 - 6998.12] P:1880.48 E:0.106904 |  They will cut inside, but also their ability to win the ball back.
[6998.16 - 7000.64] P:1806.39 E:0.103105 |  Off the ball, they've been equally as impressive.
[7000.64 - 7003.52] P:1804.90 E:0.100358 |  Marathe lays it off, Olmo picks it up,
[7003.52 - 7005.08] P:1843.91 E:0.099789 |  drifting out towards the right.
[7005.08 - 7008.00] P:1821.88 E:0.100680 |  Marathe has made the run back in towards the penalty area.
[7008.00 - 7011.36] P:1855.88 E:0.104935 |  Williams will pick it up on this near side, the left level of the area.
[7011.36 - 7014.40] P:1855.35 E:0.110809 |  Cucarera goes ahead of him, swings it in, it was a low ball,
[7014.40 - 7015.84] P:2004.49 E:0.097239 |  scabbed behind by Stokes.
[7015.84 - 7018.64] P:1924.05 E:0.108174 |  I've got to say, I'm looking forward to that duel.
[7018.64 - 7021.36] P:1941.96 E:0.106849 |  Mica Williams and Kyle Walker.
[7021.36 - 7023.28] P:1855.40 E:0.116472 |  Williams has been devastating in this tournament,
[7023.28 - 7025.48] P:1833.50 E:0.104674 |  shifts the ball onto his stronger right foot,
[7025.52 - 7028.60] P:1870.78 E:0.101706 |  whips it in and John Stones just about does enough.
[7028.60 - 7033.52] P:1837.97 E:0.106402 |  Level with his near post, gets his studs on the ball, goes behind.
[7033.52 - 7035.08] P:1852.09 E:0.107888 |  The Spanish corner.
[7035.08 - 7037.92] P:1746.23 E:0.107697 |  Le Normande is up from the back, the port is there,
[7037.92 - 7039.40] P:1824.92 E:0.092268 |  Roger is at target,
[7039.40 - 7043.00] P:1775.52 E:0.109730 |  watch for the little darting run of Carvajal towards the near post.
[7043.00 - 7048.00] P:1845.05 E:0.104375 |  And it goes towards Carvajal, and it was headed away by Bellingham.
[7048.00 - 7052.92] P:1872.48 E:0.098637 |  Of course, Bellingham will know that one very well from their realm-adrift days.
[7052.96 - 7055.56] P:1878.13 E:0.109389 |  That goal that he scored at Wembley in the Champions League final
[7055.56 - 7057.52] P:1909.92 E:0.104003 |  is already scored inside this stadium.
[7057.52 - 7063.16] P:1859.63 E:0.106438 |  He got the third goal against Croatia just before half-time in their opening match.
[7063.16 - 7065.16] P:1874.57 E:0.107645 |  They've won all six games.
[7066.48 - 7070.76] P:1802.95 E:0.108999 |  No sign has ever done that in the history of the European Championship.
[7070.76 - 7075.20] P:1841.37 E:0.115334 |  In major tournament football, only Brazil have won all seven matches.
[7075.20 - 7078.52] P:1716.76 E:0.107572 |  That was in the 2002 World Cup.
[7078.52 - 7082.28] P:1848.83 E:0.111287 |  Le Porte, forward ball, Williams, Cucarera on the overlap.
[7082.28 - 7086.64] P:1831.02 E:0.107332 |  Williams has just drifted inside, provides the width for Cucarera to get forward.
[7086.64 - 7090.64] P:1749.21 E:0.111618 |  Fabian down the line, Cucarera back towards Fabian Ruiz,
[7090.64 - 7093.12] P:1778.75 E:0.108262 |  and here now is Le Porte once again.
[7093.12 - 7097.16] P:1630.86 E:0.113437 |  England, with the exception of Harry Kane, have got everybody behind the ball.
[7097.16 - 7100.48] P:1635.71 E:0.103152 |  Fabian now will come in field.
[7100.48 - 7106.20] P:1653.92 E:0.115915 |  Saka, in praise by his defensive work in that semifinal success by Gareth Southgate.
[7106.20 - 7109.84] P:1808.82 E:0.112241 |  You can actually hear how many German supporters are inside the stadium,
[7109.88 - 7113.76] P:1735.61 E:0.111479 |  because it's the German supporters who were booing Cucarera.
[7113.76 - 7116.84] P:1706.48 E:0.110953 |  They did it in the semifinal in Munich,
[7118.20 - 7123.44] P:1821.84 E:0.114811 |  all because of the handball that was not awarded in their quarter-final defeat against Utgar.
[7123.44 - 7126.24] P:1699.77 E:0.109757 |  But that's the reason why Cucarera is being booed and jeered.
[7126.24 - 7127.60] P:1688.75 E:0.110662 |  It's not really his fault, though, is it?
[7127.60 - 7128.24] P:1465.83 E:0.095706 |  No.
[7128.24 - 7129.84] P:1746.85 E:0.101167 |  It's a bit harsh, doesn't it?
[7129.84 - 7134.16] P:1559.67 E:0.115127 |  It'll get louder and louder if the semifinal was anything to go by.
[7134.16 - 7135.48] P:1673.65 E:0.117705 |  Le Porte.
[7135.48 - 7138.84] P:1722.09 E:0.112257 |  I mean, you're already seeing great balance from Spaniard.
[7138.84 - 7141.04] P:1800.34 E:0.121551 |  Williams and Cucarera never on the same line,
[7141.04 - 7143.60] P:1839.21 E:0.112794 |  or they always just provide in an angle,
[7143.60 - 7148.12] P:1793.59 E:0.109555 |  make them very difficult to pick up and always available to receive the ball on the angle.
[7148.12 - 7151.40] P:1742.66 E:0.106910 |  Here is Le Noman, the voices of Mattsen,
[7151.40 - 7155.32] P:1748.45 E:0.112816 |  Christen and Izzy Christensen with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live,
[7155.32 - 7158.12] P:1709.53 E:0.104621 |  and BBC Sound, seven minutes played.
[7158.12 - 7163.08] P:1772.72 E:0.113324 |  This European Championship final, the 17th European Championship,
[7163.08 - 7166.36] P:1735.55 E:0.112590 |  where we've had 10 different winners in the past.
[7166.36 - 7168.52] P:1692.68 E:0.113613 |  Could England make it in 11?
[7168.52 - 7172.28] P:1799.71 E:0.111891 |  Spain are looking for a record fourth success,
[7172.28 - 7177.20] P:1703.51 E:0.114738 |  as the England supporters with that little ditzy about, Phil Foden,
[7177.20 - 7179.76] P:1655.14 E:0.111391 |  and Le Porte, formerly of Manchester City.
[7179.76 - 7182.32] P:1609.42 E:0.110089 |  Out to Williams on this near side, the left.
[7182.32 - 7184.88] P:1672.18 E:0.110708 |  Williams in field, Fabian with a little flick,
[7184.88 - 7187.36] P:1826.04 E:0.113323 |  Walker was alert, Rotary wins the ball back,
[7187.36 - 7190.44] P:1840.30 E:0.109805 |  Williams, Walker did well, loose ball comes out to Fabian,
[7190.44 - 7192.16] P:1832.38 E:0.107555 |  there was Rice to tidy up,
[7192.16 - 7194.76] P:1897.49 E:0.113353 |  but already they're looking a threat down the left-hand side.
[7194.76 - 7195.88] P:1895.46 E:0.113272 |  Unbelievable.
[7196.84 - 7199.80] P:1859.97 E:0.117570 |  Yeah, I'm saying they've been so dominant,
[7199.80 - 7203.52] P:1764.09 E:0.107208 |  it's seven and a half minutes from the England of...
[7203.52 - 7205.32] P:1784.29 E:0.118652 |  ..other in the early moments,
[7205.32 - 7209.72] P:1722.93 E:0.112959 |  gotten into the Spanish half, can't find a way to get up the pitch.
[7209.72 - 7211.96] P:1681.28 E:0.116293 |  It's a rear-guard action early on.
[7211.96 - 7214.16] P:1756.88 E:0.109897 |  I've got to say, I didn't expect anything else.
[7214.16 - 7217.72] P:1704.09 E:0.115411 |  This is going to be the game where England have to dig deep,
[7217.72 - 7221.60] P:1739.21 E:0.108349 |  defend strongly, and pick those moments.
[7221.60 - 7223.92] P:1764.73 E:0.113317 |  There's a moment of sign there, Mat,
[7223.96 - 7229.08] P:1672.56 E:0.108369 |  that so far Spain have had 72 of 76 passes completed,
[7229.08 - 7231.28] P:1712.42 E:0.116679 |  England just 11 of 14.
[7231.28 - 7233.52] P:1751.30 E:0.113485 |  That's how it feels, isn't it, Chris just said?
[7233.52 - 7236.40] P:1731.56 E:0.113848 |  It's total dominance at the moment, the way they're moving the ball
[7236.40 - 7239.56] P:1886.22 E:0.113719 |  is devastating, and England are just sitting off
[7239.56 - 7243.64] P:1886.92 E:0.112140 |  and trying to just defend deep, not come too far out,
[7243.64 - 7245.16] P:1864.45 E:0.106414 |  because as we spoke beforehand,
[7245.16 - 7247.16] P:1855.19 E:0.109027 |  I think if they do come too high up the pitch,
[7247.16 - 7249.16] P:1711.31 E:0.101015 |  they're just going to get picked off,
[7249.16 - 7251.16] P:1683.07 E:0.106752 |  and trying to make the pitch a little bit more compact,
[7251.16 - 7253.16] P:1758.65 E:0.104854 |  and the quality of the one-touch pass
[7253.16 - 7256.16] P:1668.37 E:0.109872 |  and the anticipation of Rodney, if it does pop out into the middle,
[7256.16 - 7259.16] P:1732.26 E:0.114120 |  he seems to be first to the ball and just keeping those attacks alive.
[7259.16 - 7261.16] P:1725.05 E:0.111632 |  Gerrard Southgate, incidentally,
[7261.16 - 7264.16] P:1654.63 E:0.112486 |  he's just been gently with his left hand, just waving England forward.
[7264.16 - 7267.16] P:1815.35 E:0.112220 |  I think he was conscious they were sitting a little bit too deep.
[7267.16 - 7271.16] P:1773.11 E:0.111190 |  Rice tried to thread the ball out to the near side, the right,
[7271.16 - 7273.16] P:1684.36 E:0.104800 |  but again, that's where Spain are so impressive,
[7273.16 - 7276.16] P:1727.00 E:0.107819 |  the way they hunt and to try and win the ball back
[7276.16 - 7278.16] P:1729.96 E:0.112200 |  as quickly as possible,
[7278.16 - 7281.16] P:1628.66 E:0.114945 |  and then nine minutes played on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[7281.16 - 7285.16] P:1676.89 E:0.114656 |  Inside a stadium where England are undefeated
[7285.16 - 7289.16] P:1698.33 E:0.115498 |  in their previous six visits as Walker with a throw
[7289.16 - 7292.16] P:1633.02 E:0.116213 |  in front of the ball headed coach, Luis Delapuente,
[7292.16 - 7295.16] P:1609.12 E:0.117309 |  done ever so well since he has taken charge
[7295.16 - 7297.16] P:1650.16 E:0.109720 |  of the Spanish national side,
[7297.16 - 7301.16] P:1618.72 E:0.114883 |  picked it all in yellow, clears the ball out towards Saka,
[7301.16 - 7303.16] P:1674.59 E:0.110619 |  up against Cucaraya, holds off the challenge.
[7303.16 - 7307.16] P:1552.30 E:0.110647 |  Cucaraya just gives him a little push in the back with his left hand.
[7307.16 - 7309.16] P:1602.00 E:0.110289 |  England back with stones now.
[7309.16 - 7311.16] P:1737.87 E:0.113132 |  Marathe will drop towards him.
[7311.16 - 7314.16] P:1678.53 E:0.111739 |  Pickford made himself available on the edge of the area.
[7314.16 - 7316.16] P:1853.25 E:0.117284 |  You see how high the Spanish line is.
[7316.16 - 7319.16] P:1786.90 E:0.112163 |  England have to have that thread in behind.
[7319.16 - 7322.16] P:1784.68 E:0.109918 |  It's not Harry Kane making the movement,
[7322.16 - 7324.16] P:1846.30 E:0.118100 |  certainly Saka needs to.
[7324.16 - 7326.16] P:1849.63 E:0.121859 |  Rice with a lay-off.
[7326.16 - 7328.16] P:1816.19 E:0.110917 |  Bellingham was caught by Rodgery.
[7328.16 - 7330.16] P:1816.61 E:0.112349 |  Francois Luttexier will give that free kick.
[7330.16 - 7334.16] P:1934.45 E:0.111514 |  He won't take any action against the Manchester City player, though.
[7334.16 - 7336.16] P:1830.14 E:0.111868 |  It was a bouncing ball.
[7336.16 - 7339.16] P:1866.93 E:0.112687 |  Declan Rice tried to pop it into Drew Bellingham,
[7339.16 - 7341.16] P:1742.80 E:0.110197 |  but gave him a bouncing ball.
[7341.16 - 7343.16] P:1766.18 E:0.106398 |  He just got there first.
[7343.16 - 7346.16] P:1643.04 E:0.115717 |  He goes down relatively easily, Bellingham,
[7346.16 - 7348.16] P:1748.44 E:0.114875 |  but wins the foul.
[7348.16 - 7352.16] P:1733.20 E:0.115094 |  It's a welcome bit of breathing space in the Spanish half,
[7352.16 - 7355.16] P:1693.47 E:0.118286 |  getting the territory a little bit further up the pitch for England,
[7355.16 - 7358.16] P:1661.16 E:0.116705 |  who have just been camped in our own half
[7358.16 - 7360.16] P:1753.10 E:0.111558 |  for the first ten minutes of this game.
[7360.16 - 7363.16] P:1760.49 E:0.113946 |  Highline to deal with this free kick from the Spanish defense.
[7363.16 - 7365.16] P:1572.35 E:0.120311 |  0-0.
[7365.16 - 7368.16] P:1687.18 E:0.114724 |  BBC Radio 5 Live and the World Service.
[7368.16 - 7370.16] P:1714.91 E:0.112645 |  Sure to take it. Left-footed.
[7370.16 - 7372.16] P:1808.38 E:0.113929 |  Art tips way deep.
[7372.16 - 7375.16] P:1829.91 E:0.114532 |  Referee's blown his whistle, pushing inside the penalty area.
[7375.16 - 7378.16] P:1808.64 E:0.106548 |  The court was the player who was knocked to the floor,
[7378.16 - 7381.16] P:1699.93 E:0.105673 |  and that will be a Spain free kick.
[7381.16 - 7383.16] P:1500.70 E:0.116305 |  It was gay here.
[7383.16 - 7385.16] P:1480.90 E:0.132566 |  That's so soft, isn't it?
[7385.16 - 7388.16] P:1804.08 E:0.115306 |  The court feels the slightest bit of contact
[7388.16 - 7391.16] P:1785.77 E:0.129332 |  from the constant referee in that situation.
[7391.16 - 7393.16] P:1729.36 E:0.123047 |  He did very little wrong there.
[7393.16 - 7395.16] P:1767.35 E:0.111445 |  Soft.
[7395.16 - 7397.16] P:1809.32 E:0.121206 |  La Porte, square ball.
[7397.16 - 7400.16] P:1760.47 E:0.099573 |  They no man back to Simon.
[7400.16 - 7404.16] P:1761.32 E:0.105835 |  Simon, who's tasted success in the development teams for Spain
[7404.16 - 7406.16] P:1556.39 E:0.103869 |  under Luis de la Fuente.
[7406.16 - 7410.16] P:1671.16 E:0.106025 |  Herrera, a number of his disciples, if you like,
[7410.16 - 7412.16] P:1641.17 E:0.106491 |  that have served him so well.
[7412.16 - 7415.16] P:1648.24 E:0.115482 |  There's Carvajal with a long diagonal ball.
[7415.16 - 7418.16] P:1810.93 E:0.110778 |  He runs towards Fabian, he now runs out.
[7418.16 - 7421.16] P:1797.07 E:0.112238 |  He knows where Williams is and he plays it first time.
[7421.16 - 7424.16] P:1874.39 E:0.109654 |  And Williams latches onto it, left-hand side.
[7424.16 - 7426.16] P:1843.71 E:0.100598 |  Stones has to cover.
[7426.16 - 7429.16] P:1886.33 E:0.113176 |  Williams enters the penalty area, goes on the outside.
[7429.16 - 7431.16] P:1970.32 E:0.103003 |  Stones makes a terrific challenge.
[7431.16 - 7433.16] P:1931.01 E:0.109758 |  Out it goes for a corner kick.
[7433.16 - 7435.16] P:1882.33 E:0.107988 |  I'll tell you what, danger there.
[7435.16 - 7437.16] P:1831.56 E:0.104563 |  Massive danger for England.
[7437.16 - 7440.16] P:1832.16 E:0.114246 |  Walker out of position up the pitch,
[7440.16 - 7442.16] P:1805.23 E:0.118151 |  and then Stones is isolated,
[7442.16 - 7445.16] P:1849.67 E:0.111508 |  and Williams, who's been devastating in those 1v1 situations,
[7445.16 - 7447.16] P:1849.32 E:0.106150 |  throws a step over.
[7447.16 - 7449.16] P:1792.76 E:0.100381 |  Stones, it's brilliant defending.
[7449.16 - 7451.16] P:1846.05 E:0.104771 |  Doesn't fall for it.
[7451.16 - 7454.16] P:1801.45 E:0.114793 |  Makes the block, but he's troubled for an England player.
[7454.16 - 7456.16] P:1753.57 E:0.105547 |  Kyle Walker.
[7456.16 - 7460.16] P:1730.98 E:0.107174 |  Doesn't know what happened, does he hold in his hamstring?
[7460.16 - 7466.16] P:1784.71 E:0.109919 |  Well, this would be a real shame for Kyle Walker.
[7466.16 - 7468.16] P:1705.62 E:0.108548 |  He went sliding in.
[7468.16 - 7470.16] P:1835.56 E:0.111058 |  He actually...
[7471.16 - 7474.16] P:1782.67 E:0.118732 |  He caught the feet of Delafuente.
[7474.16 - 7477.16] P:1751.09 E:0.111008 |  It's actually Delafuente in the way of him.
[7477.16 - 7481.16] P:1774.28 E:0.109556 |  Did he catch his knee as it goes from grass to Astroturf?
[7481.16 - 7483.16] P:1739.96 E:0.111390 |  There's a little ridge.
[7483.16 - 7486.16] P:1846.27 E:0.108277 |  Whether or not he just jards something, he's hobbling back on.
[7486.16 - 7489.16] P:1849.55 E:0.112523 |  But back to what Stones did in that defending.
[7489.16 - 7491.16] P:1761.26 E:0.112884 |  His body shape was superb.
[7491.16 - 7494.16] P:1781.02 E:0.115488 |  He did not allow Williams inside, forced him on the outside.
[7494.16 - 7497.16] P:1801.90 E:0.111828 |  Williams with a corner kick, he goes deep.
[7497.16 - 7500.16] P:1831.06 E:0.107859 |  And it was off target from Les Mourmans.
[7500.16 - 7505.16] P:1843.50 E:0.105746 |  I can tell you, by the way, and Izzy will verify this,
[7505.16 - 7508.16] P:1780.89 E:0.104106 |  there are a number of ridges down there.
[7508.16 - 7512.16] P:1748.37 E:0.101763 |  When we walked pitchside yesterday, I stumbled two or three times.
[7512.16 - 7514.16] P:1717.30 E:0.102994 |  I was like a late-night reveler.
[7514.16 - 7516.16] P:1763.42 E:0.110867 |  Izzy, you'll vouch for that, won't you?
[7516.16 - 7519.16] P:1732.50 E:0.105220 |  Oh, yes, Deno, lots of ridges down here.
[7519.16 - 7522.16] P:1812.39 E:0.112851 |  Can I just go back to that tackle that John Stones made?
[7522.16 - 7524.16] P:1768.83 E:0.108976 |  I was absolutely magnificent right in front of me.
[7524.16 - 7527.16] P:1721.59 E:0.107706 |  He had to time it to perfection, and he did.
[7527.16 - 7530.16] P:1727.70 E:0.111189 |  And there was a real chest pump between him and Pickford after that,
[7530.16 - 7532.16] P:1773.73 E:0.107275 |  because that was an important challenge by him.
[7532.16 - 7534.16] P:1902.97 E:0.110175 |  You could almost go back to that conversation
[7534.16 - 7537.16] P:1834.23 E:0.111366 |  we were having with Dyer on Ramos
[7537.16 - 7541.16] P:1791.99 E:0.113536 |  when the sides last met in England won 3-2 in October 2018
[7541.16 - 7542.16] P:1947.58 E:0.111676 |  in the Nations League.
[7542.16 - 7544.16] P:1815.91 E:0.111028 |  But that is a big moment. It is.
[7544.16 - 7547.16] P:1856.94 E:0.109870 |  Because it just lifts, it gives you the belief
[7547.16 - 7549.16] P:1751.09 E:0.102060 |  to chest pump with the goalkeeper.
[7549.16 - 7551.16] P:1723.09 E:0.106620 |  He knows that's a massive tackle,
[7551.16 - 7553.16] P:1777.22 E:0.107052 |  because that is a huge...
[7553.16 - 7556.16] P:1789.44 E:0.111905 |  William's running at you in that area of the box
[7556.16 - 7557.16] P:1876.05 E:0.098984 |  with space around you.
[7557.16 - 7559.16] P:1681.57 E:0.109285 |  I mean, that's big trouble for a centre-back,
[7559.16 - 7560.16] P:1661.71 E:0.113251 |  and he handled it brilliantly.
[7560.16 - 7563.16] P:1631.47 E:0.115856 |  That's why I had John Stones in my team at the tournament.
[7563.16 - 7565.16] P:1823.22 E:0.112589 |  Was he in there?
[7565.16 - 7567.16] P:1759.74 E:0.109251 |  Was that with the rest of the Spanish squad?
[7567.16 - 7568.16] P:1682.52 E:0.107605 |  Mostly.
[7568.16 - 7571.16] P:1787.56 E:0.109302 |  Here is Le Normand out to Carvajal.
[7571.16 - 7573.16] P:1652.26 E:0.099836 |  He'd have made it, wouldn't he? Carvajal at right back.
[7573.16 - 7575.16] P:1636.64 E:0.099441 |  He was in, yeah.
[7575.16 - 7576.16] P:1699.61 E:0.092013 |  He was in mine.
[7576.16 - 7577.16] P:1708.95 E:0.102103 |  Roderick,
[7577.16 - 7579.16] P:1760.06 E:0.096698 |  Square-ball,
[7579.16 - 7581.16] P:1762.61 E:0.100775 |  coming onto it is Le Port,
[7581.16 - 7583.16] P:1803.72 E:0.107203 |  feeds it out towards Williams.
[7583.16 - 7585.16] P:1856.88 E:0.115041 |  Walker still not running too freely at the moment.
[7585.16 - 7587.16] P:1850.41 E:0.097059 |  Sack is going to have to help out.
[7587.16 - 7588.16] P:1857.51 E:0.097429 |  Cross comes into the penalty area.
[7588.16 - 7589.16] P:1843.10 E:0.113328 |  Marathe was lurking,
[7589.16 - 7591.16] P:1860.16 E:0.106436 |  header away by Maynou.
[7591.16 - 7592.16] P:1856.59 E:0.107991 |  Foden plays it back.
[7592.16 - 7594.16] P:1848.65 E:0.109265 |  Now Bellingham can run forward.
[7594.16 - 7597.16] P:1859.87 E:0.107490 |  Look how quickly surrounded by the red shirts of Spain.
[7597.16 - 7598.16] P:1903.65 E:0.112626 |  It's so impressive.
[7598.16 - 7602.16] P:1824.32 E:0.112253 |  It's incredible the way the Spanish players recover.
[7602.16 - 7604.16] P:1773.76 E:0.108589 |  Bellingham's driving.
[7604.16 - 7606.16] P:1719.14 E:0.109501 |  I think there's left-hand side.
[7606.16 - 7609.16] P:1668.81 E:0.110328 |  It doesn't have any real options other than to keep going.
[7609.16 - 7610.16] P:1626.94 E:0.094345 |  Actually,
[7610.16 - 7612.16] P:1656.03 E:0.113722 |  Marlou gets back and makes the challenge,
[7612.16 - 7613.16] P:1517.12 E:0.113200 |  but surrounded there,
[7613.16 - 7614.16] P:1660.94 E:0.106828 |  chewed Bellingham.
[7614.16 - 7616.16] P:1779.75 E:0.112995 |  The early stages, first 15 minutes,
[7616.16 - 7619.16] P:1678.37 E:0.104603 |  you've got to say this has been a bit of a mismatch.
[7619.16 - 7621.16] P:1608.33 E:0.114514 |  Spain have been so, so dominant.
[7621.16 - 7625.16] P:1746.30 E:0.105434 |  You see that they have clear patterns of play.
[7625.16 - 7626.16] P:1637.26 E:0.112695 |  England,
[7626.16 - 7628.16] P:1564.24 E:0.105487 |  it's going to say pretty bitty.
[7628.16 - 7630.16] P:1712.55 E:0.113952 |  Trippier has been warming up.
[7630.16 - 7633.16] P:1879.32 E:0.115191 |  Walker now looks okay as he accelerates forward.
[7633.16 - 7634.16] P:1847.76 E:0.115208 |  Lingland attacks.
[7634.16 - 7635.16] P:1872.82 E:0.103425 |  Saka,
[7635.16 - 7636.16] P:2000.56 E:0.113623 |  Walker's going to go on the overlap.
[7636.16 - 7637.16] P:1878.88 E:0.116926 |  Walker is here now.
[7637.16 - 7638.16] P:1869.95 E:0.107290 |  It's a first-time cross,
[7638.16 - 7639.16] P:1993.41 E:0.110277 |  drilled in with pace,
[7639.16 - 7642.16] P:1879.21 E:0.105989 |  cut out by LePorte for a corner kick.
[7642.16 - 7643.16] P:1871.12 E:0.113671 |  There you go.
[7643.16 - 7647.16] P:1883.11 E:0.111765 |  That's the first time we've seen England
[7647.16 - 7648.16] P:1817.80 E:0.126844 |  really attack confidently.
[7648.16 - 7650.16] P:1900.57 E:0.112052 |  Quick switcher play.
[7650.16 - 7651.16] P:1886.97 E:0.112607 |  Saka driving the inside,
[7651.16 - 7652.16] P:1725.95 E:0.122482 |  feeds Walker,
[7652.16 - 7654.16] P:1810.40 E:0.118230 |  who's been roaring down that right-hand side.
[7654.16 - 7656.16] P:1841.65 E:0.108472 |  Good positioning.
[7656.16 - 7658.16] P:1701.23 E:0.113075 |  Matt from LePorte at the near post.
[7658.16 - 7659.16] P:1993.47 E:0.102872 |  Yeah, he just read it, didn't he?
[7659.16 - 7660.16] P:1953.81 E:0.100240 |  Got across.
[7660.16 - 7661.16] P:1851.67 E:0.102514 |  I mean, I thought
[7661.16 - 7663.16] P:1847.06 E:0.107632 |  they might have just put a bit of height on the ball, really,
[7663.16 - 7664.16] P:1881.75 E:0.108327 |  because it was quite comfortable
[7664.16 - 7666.16] P:1868.40 E:0.112996 |  just blocking it with his side foot.
[7666.16 - 7667.16] P:1788.18 E:0.110105 |  But what a run.
[7667.16 - 7669.16] P:1820.19 E:0.106870 |  What an overlapping run from Karl Walker
[7669.16 - 7672.16] P:1813.47 E:0.105668 |  and really exploited that space down the side.
[7672.16 - 7674.16] P:1862.67 E:0.116015 |  Pilpoden with a corner, plays it in low.
[7674.16 - 7676.16] P:1852.77 E:0.111106 |  Cleared by Marata.
[7676.16 - 7678.16] P:1849.34 E:0.107473 |  Spain had everybody back with their red shirts
[7678.16 - 7680.16] P:1861.00 E:0.109764 |  in and around their own penalty area.
[7680.16 - 7682.16] P:1834.09 E:0.086546 |  Declan Rice picks it up,
[7682.16 - 7684.16] P:1780.53 E:0.103911 |  still inside the Spanish half,
[7684.16 - 7686.16] P:1831.93 E:0.098589 |  back towards Walker,
[7686.16 - 7687.16] P:1822.86 E:0.105367 |  deliberates what to do,
[7687.16 - 7689.16] P:1867.68 E:0.104270 |  switches it out towards that far side,
[7689.16 - 7690.16] P:1778.91 E:0.106036 |  the left for Shaw,
[7690.16 - 7692.16] P:1779.07 E:0.108818 |  gay he now running back into
[7692.16 - 7694.16] P:1810.14 E:0.113142 |  midway through the English half,
[7694.16 - 7696.16] P:1805.10 E:0.112105 |  then leaves it towards Declan Rice.
[7696.16 - 7698.16] P:1778.75 E:0.105746 |  Cobbie Maynou just says,
[7698.16 - 7699.16] P:1718.90 E:0.117759 |  slow down, we're OK.
[7699.16 - 7701.16] P:1756.79 E:0.103898 |  Passes it then towards Stone.
[7701.16 - 7704.16] P:1735.04 E:0.106231 |  Foden demands it to his feet, gets it, heavy touch,
[7704.16 - 7706.16] P:1731.45 E:0.103816 |  plays it back towards Maynou,
[7706.16 - 7708.16] P:1696.02 E:0.112235 |  and then a hurried ball, Stone,
[7708.16 - 7709.16] P:1828.87 E:0.104193 |  so he'll keep it in play.
[7709.16 - 7711.16] P:1742.68 E:0.109154 |  He's hounded now by Williams,
[7711.16 - 7713.16] P:1814.98 E:0.114229 |  and he has to clip that one back rather awkwardly.
[7713.16 - 7715.16] P:1870.07 E:0.105824 |  Just an anxious moment for Pickford,
[7715.16 - 7717.16] P:1851.87 E:0.103814 |  forced him two or three yards further back,
[7717.16 - 7719.16] P:1806.80 E:0.104786 |  and he's all yellow,
[7719.16 - 7721.16] P:1895.93 E:0.109901 |  but his distribution hits it downward head up,
[7721.16 - 7724.16] P:1884.31 E:0.106626 |  Belligham Shaw now looks to try that switch of play
[7724.16 - 7725.16] P:1813.23 E:0.110799 |  from left to right,
[7725.16 - 7727.16] P:1942.42 E:0.104561 |  and Sacher up against Kukereya.
[7727.16 - 7729.16] P:1889.87 E:0.107274 |  Kukereya back pedals,
[7729.16 - 7730.16] P:1923.77 E:0.108007 |  Williams come to help him out,
[7730.16 - 7731.16] P:1934.64 E:0.106929 |  they'll double upon Sacher.
[7731.16 - 7733.16] P:1879.26 E:0.098721 |  Sacher away from Kukereya,
[7733.16 - 7734.16] P:1909.18 E:0.105249 |  plays it back,
[7734.16 - 7736.16] P:1901.28 E:0.112195 |  Rice arriving, good block from Rodgery,
[7736.16 - 7738.16] P:1903.49 E:0.113277 |  Ball spins up in the air,
[7738.16 - 7741.16] P:1912.72 E:0.108469 |  Belligham takes it away, Shaw takes over,
[7741.16 - 7743.16] P:1969.13 E:0.109983 |  left hand side, Shaw's low ball,
[7743.16 - 7745.16] P:1922.54 E:0.108439 |  almost reaches Sacher,
[7745.16 - 7747.16] P:1882.38 E:0.117403 |  cleared on the half, followed by Kukereya,
[7747.16 - 7749.16] P:1820.67 E:0.107852 |  Svane defending well, 0-0,
[7749.16 - 7751.16] P:1828.03 E:0.105531 |  and England trying to take the game to Svane,
[7751.16 - 7754.16] P:1797.48 E:0.116501 |  here in Berlin, with 17 minutes play.
[7754.16 - 7756.16] P:1787.18 E:0.116815 |  Much better from England,
[7756.16 - 7758.16] P:1835.21 E:0.115168 |  first of all, Sacher down the right hand side,
[7759.16 - 7761.16] P:1853.10 E:0.121682 |  Shaw was blocked from Declan Rice,
[7761.16 - 7763.16] P:1737.62 E:0.120422 |  20 yards out, and in the cross from Shaw,
[7763.16 - 7764.16] P:1748.78 E:0.115048 |  which Kukereya dealt with.
[7764.16 - 7766.16] P:1921.78 E:0.112499 |  Sacher up against Kukereya,
[7766.16 - 7768.16] P:1893.81 E:0.108162 |  Walker bombing on the inside this time,
[7768.16 - 7770.16] P:1927.22 E:0.101838 |  Sacher on the stretch,
[7770.16 - 7772.16] P:1899.47 E:0.110388 |  Bowden just couldn't take it there,
[7772.16 - 7774.16] P:1944.41 E:0.113021 |  as he's leport just to step forward
[7774.16 - 7776.16] P:1889.94 E:0.113032 |  and break up that move.
[7776.16 - 7779.16] P:1902.08 E:0.109514 |  I'll tell you, I watched the goals earlier today,
[7779.16 - 7782.16] P:1930.91 E:0.108463 |  Arsenal beat Chelsea in April 5-0,
[7784.16 - 7786.16] P:1857.88 E:0.119440 |  and I think Kukereya was at fault for the Glen White goal,
[7786.16 - 7789.16] P:1877.91 E:0.113334 |  it didn't react quick enough when he scored from close range,
[7789.16 - 7792.16] P:1833.43 E:0.108755 |  Habert's got in between Kukereya and the central defender,
[7792.16 - 7794.16] P:1769.94 E:0.109996 |  and the fourth and fifth goals,
[7794.16 - 7796.16] P:1765.68 E:0.112199 |  Sacher had Kukereya on the right hand side,
[7796.16 - 7797.16] P:1766.92 E:0.107709 |  but both of them.
[7797.16 - 7799.16] P:1722.70 E:0.118021 |  Well, England looked to switch that ball earlier,
[7799.16 - 7801.16] P:1846.72 E:0.115249 |  that's the beauty about having the left footer with Shaw,
[7801.16 - 7804.16] P:1792.57 E:0.113634 |  he can get his head up and he can just ping that left foot diagonal
[7804.16 - 7806.16] P:1740.31 E:0.118233 |  all the way across the field,
[7806.16 - 7808.16] P:1678.66 E:0.113494 |  and it just gives Sacher a bit of momentum
[7808.16 - 7810.16] P:1632.06 E:0.117887 |  going into that 1v1 situation,
[7810.16 - 7812.16] P:1768.31 E:0.110920 |  which Kukereya's kind of done okay with,
[7812.16 - 7814.16] P:1762.86 E:0.113319 |  but you can see the pattern Spain have,
[7814.16 - 7816.16] P:1761.27 E:0.111163 |  it's lovely and fluid,
[7816.16 - 7817.16] P:1714.57 E:0.116287 |  but when we get on the ball,
[7817.16 - 7820.16] P:1660.17 E:0.120603 |  we've got players that can create really top passes,
[7820.16 - 7822.16] P:1645.53 E:0.118611 |  that can go past players,
[7822.16 - 7825.16] P:1629.95 E:0.115715 |  and we've just got this energy about us getting the ball in the box,
[7825.16 - 7827.16] P:1679.47 E:0.111110 |  and it's been very much that,
[7827.16 - 7829.16] P:1767.65 E:0.111620 |  it's like a boxing match where one team is just
[7829.16 - 7831.16] P:1575.98 E:0.118315 |  defending most of the time,
[7831.16 - 7833.16] P:1644.06 E:0.117274 |  and then they've got these little flurries that will come out,
[7833.16 - 7835.16] P:1432.43 E:0.111607 |  and that is England.
[7835.16 - 7837.16] P:1543.74 E:0.115809 |  Here is Olmo, quite quiet so far,
[7837.16 - 7839.16] P:1732.70 E:0.116608 |  Olmo, Marat has made the run, plays it behind him,
[7839.16 - 7841.16] P:1871.55 E:0.112187 |  and Mal tried to get there,
[7841.16 - 7843.16] P:1808.79 E:0.108803 |  excellent defending on the cover,
[7843.16 - 7845.16] P:1801.45 E:0.115291 |  tucking in there was the left back Luke Shaw,
[7845.16 - 7849.16] P:1778.05 E:0.111034 |  that burst of pace from the now 17 year old,
[7849.16 - 7851.16] P:1642.23 E:0.116201 |  that is birthday yesterday.
[7851.16 - 7853.16] P:1726.16 E:0.117528 |  You're right about Danny Olmo,
[7853.16 - 7854.16] P:1802.66 E:0.120946 |  he has been very quiet,
[7854.16 - 7859.16] P:1721.72 E:0.113980 |  he's always trying to pick up those spaces between the England back line
[7859.16 - 7861.16] P:1643.10 E:0.118809 |  and the England midfield,
[7861.16 - 7863.16] P:1691.26 E:0.113983 |  and it's actually been an upgrade on Pedri,
[7863.16 - 7865.16] P:1759.08 E:0.113532 |  since he's come into the team,
[7865.16 - 7867.16] P:1828.31 E:0.114721 |  Luke Shaw,
[7867.16 - 7869.16] P:1731.21 E:0.120266 |  he's had that situation really well.
[7869.16 - 7874.16] P:1724.95 E:0.118309 |  I mean, Duke Bellingham really has got the left side shift today, hasn't he?
[7874.16 - 7877.16] P:1708.18 E:0.120734 |  He's really sticking to the left hand side of the pitch for England,
[7877.16 - 7881.16] P:1713.21 E:0.121597 |  that kind of position that nobody's really feeling particularly natural in.
[7881.16 - 7884.16] P:1745.22 E:0.110150 |  Olmo, out to Carvajal on the right,
[7884.16 - 7887.16] P:1856.30 E:0.111668 |  Carvajal delivers the cross straight down the throat of Jordan Pickford,
[7888.16 - 7892.16] P:1864.87 E:0.108138 |  as the Sun is setting that end of the ground,
[7892.16 - 7896.16] P:1736.70 E:0.110633 |  so there's a little bit of a pink haze in that gap of the stadium,
[7896.16 - 7898.16] P:1717.87 E:0.109600 |  the marathon gate here in Berlin,
[7898.16 - 7902.16] P:1784.94 E:0.111502 |  19 minutes played on BBC Radio 5 Live,
[7902.16 - 7905.16] P:1706.30 E:0.102933 |  Spain nil, England nil,
[7905.16 - 7907.16] P:1840.58 E:0.116467 |  in this European Championship final,
[7907.16 - 7912.16] P:1900.78 E:0.112221 |  as Shaw didn't quite keep the ball in play.
[7912.16 - 7915.16] P:1891.39 E:0.099905 |  It'll be a Spain throw, Matt Obstin.
[7915.16 - 7919.16] P:1839.49 E:0.112419 |  Another little surge where you think Duke Bellingham's going to do something,
[7919.16 - 7921.16] P:1633.67 E:0.109820 |  went round one player,
[7921.16 - 7923.16] P:1853.87 E:0.114840 |  then sees the ball to try and flick it down the line for Shaw,
[7923.16 - 7925.16] P:1822.31 E:0.107459 |  but just couldn't keep it in.
[7925.16 - 7928.16] P:1791.06 E:0.113955 |  Fabio, referee's played the advantage.
[7928.16 - 7930.16] P:1825.94 E:0.114048 |  Out to Williams on this, near side the left,
[7930.16 - 7932.16] P:1825.64 E:0.101528 |  Williams up against Walker,
[7932.16 - 7935.16] P:1857.81 E:0.104856 |  Walker threatens to dive in, then changes his mind.
[7936.16 - 7938.16] P:1742.72 E:0.117928 |  Cucarera provides the support,
[7938.16 - 7940.16] P:1877.55 E:0.109167 |  Rodry in field,
[7940.16 - 7943.16] P:1780.82 E:0.116731 |  Lamingo Mow this time in a central area,
[7944.16 - 7946.16] P:1839.99 E:0.114262 |  once he's on that left foot of his,
[7946.16 - 7950.16] P:1792.58 E:0.106617 |  Olmo just trying to see if there's a way through,
[7950.16 - 7952.16] P:1824.72 E:0.117595 |  Mayn who forces Olmo away,
[7952.16 - 7954.16] P:1850.84 E:0.104493 |  goes back out towards Williams, but again,
[7954.16 - 7956.16] P:1742.05 E:0.111870 |  Walker...
[7956.16 - 7958.16] P:1781.94 E:0.131393 |  It's interesting because he won the early exchanges,
[7958.16 - 7960.16] P:1826.39 E:0.122504 |  didn't even Williams,
[7960.16 - 7962.16] P:1922.81 E:0.119623 |  Walker did with Joland,
[7962.16 - 7964.16] P:1882.62 E:0.118599 |  he looks slightly reluctant,
[7964.16 - 7967.16] P:1877.93 E:0.114286 |  when the ball does go out wide to him,
[7967.16 - 7969.16] P:1841.81 E:0.109614 |  to actually get it, Carl Walker.
[7969.16 - 7971.16] P:1814.21 E:0.111109 |  England fans cheering because
[7971.16 - 7973.16] P:1726.92 E:0.112881 |  Saccar has just barged over Cucarera,
[7973.16 - 7976.16] P:1603.26 E:0.107775 |  and he didn't get any support from the French official,
[7976.16 - 7978.16] P:1700.68 E:0.113412 |  as Le Port now in the centre circle.
[7978.16 - 7981.16] P:1719.55 E:0.109049 |  Every outfield player is in the half away towards,
[7981.16 - 7983.16] P:1691.58 E:0.109778 |  our left-hand side,
[7983.16 - 7985.16] P:1708.75 E:0.105272 |  Lamingo Mow, triangular passing
[7985.16 - 7988.16] P:1805.21 E:0.113213 |  between the two central defenders and Fabio.
[7989.16 - 7991.16] P:1849.48 E:0.116536 |  Cucarera this time goes central,
[7991.16 - 7993.16] P:1752.69 E:0.108992 |  Rodry is out on this left with Williams,
[7993.16 - 7995.16] P:1762.84 E:0.117272 |  and here is Williams now up against Sacke,
[7995.16 - 7998.16] P:1679.45 E:0.110103 |  he gets past Saccar, he's then got Walker to deal with.
[7999.16 - 8001.16] P:1687.78 E:0.109243 |  Williams delivers the cross,
[8001.16 - 8003.16] P:1713.63 E:0.108428 |  this is Fabian, Bellingham.
[8004.16 - 8007.16] P:1789.92 E:0.114232 |  Fabian turns, so composed on the ball is Fabian,
[8007.16 - 8010.16] P:1839.65 E:0.119167 |  but now Foden will bring it away for England,
[8010.16 - 8013.16] P:1762.91 E:0.108661 |  and back towards Saccar on this near side,
[8013.16 - 8015.16] P:1721.08 E:0.106797 |  Williams tries to put him under pressure,
[8015.16 - 8017.16] P:1746.17 E:0.115167 |  Cucarera higher up the pitch,
[8017.16 - 8019.16] P:1916.42 E:0.113715 |  fouls Foden.
[8019.16 - 8021.16] P:1903.36 E:0.112801 |  I mean, what Fabian did there,
[8021.16 - 8024.16] P:1936.72 E:0.117009 |  absorbing the force of Bellingham,
[8024.16 - 8026.16] P:1833.69 E:0.107433 |  not only that, but then he uses him
[8026.16 - 8028.16] P:1726.23 E:0.129819 |  and he rolls in with his touch,
[8028.16 - 8030.16] P:1756.34 E:0.111723 |  I mean, it was world-class midfield play,
[8030.16 - 8032.16] P:1823.23 E:0.113719 |  the way he just handled that ball, created time,
[8032.16 - 8035.16] P:1699.37 E:0.115425 |  and then offloads it into his teammate, Olimo.
[8035.16 - 8038.16] P:1716.73 E:0.118607 |  I mean, just some of the technical capability
[8038.16 - 8042.16] P:1722.17 E:0.117620 |  of that Spanish midfield is absolutely phenomenal.
[8043.16 - 8046.16] P:1724.56 E:0.122855 |  Stones waits to take the free kick.
[8047.16 - 8050.16] P:1766.12 E:0.118814 |  No team, incidentally, has reached consecutive Euro finals
[8050.16 - 8052.16] P:1907.81 E:0.112026 |  and has lost two in a row.
[8052.16 - 8055.16] P:1798.87 E:0.113098 |  Four times that a nation has got to back to back,
[8055.16 - 8059.16] P:1815.67 E:0.110039 |  finals, England are hoping
[8059.16 - 8064.16] P:1854.48 E:0.117148 |  to wipe away the disappointment
[8064.16 - 8067.16] P:1676.33 E:0.111308 |  and that gut-wrenching defeat on penalties
[8067.16 - 8071.16] P:1738.74 E:0.117117 |  three years ago to Italy at Wembley Stadium.
[8072.16 - 8075.16] P:1693.52 E:0.117365 |  As Leynall Mann climbs to head the ball away,
[8075.16 - 8077.16] P:1772.98 E:0.114634 |  Rice with the aerial, Jules wins that,
[8077.16 - 8079.16] P:1723.87 E:0.101990 |  LePort head her away, now it's with Marata,
[8079.16 - 8082.16] P:1734.34 E:0.109852 |  the Spain captain, can't hold on to the ball,
[8082.16 - 8086.16] P:1859.07 E:0.112397 |  as he stumbles and Stones sees it out of play
[8086.16 - 8088.16] P:1769.10 E:0.105525 |  and it will be a Spain throw.
[8088.16 - 8090.16] P:1873.37 E:0.113931 |  Well, midway through the first half,
[8090.16 - 8092.16] P:1851.78 E:0.116872 |  you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live,
[8092.16 - 8095.16] P:1797.49 E:0.109517 |  BBC Sounds and the World Service.
[8095.16 - 8097.16] P:1849.49 E:0.113917 |  We're here in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin
[8097.16 - 8099.16] P:1882.59 E:0.102462 |  and to take you through to halftime
[8099.16 - 8101.16] P:1823.57 E:0.108038 |  is our correspondent John Murray.
[8101.16 - 8103.16] P:1802.46 E:0.117030 |  Thank you, Ian.
[8103.16 - 8106.16] P:1727.46 E:0.115001 |  So it is Spain on the attack,
[8106.16 - 8108.16] P:1774.39 E:0.110358 |  all played up to Williams,
[8108.16 - 8111.16] P:1741.77 E:0.112560 |  Williams moving infield and then with the outside of his boot
[8111.16 - 8115.16] P:1690.17 E:0.108495 |  he actually passes it some distance behind the now 17-year-old
[8115.16 - 8119.16] P:1651.64 E:0.111468 |  Lamin Yamal, who scored that stunning goal in the semi-final.
[8119.16 - 8121.16] P:1675.26 E:0.117246 |  Ball lifted into the penalty area,
[8121.16 - 8123.16] P:1859.41 E:0.120871 |  but the England goalkeeper, Pickford,
[8123.16 - 8125.16] P:1890.44 E:0.111952 |  comes out and takes the catch.
[8125.16 - 8127.16] P:1761.87 E:0.113926 |  Certainly the opening period of the game
[8127.16 - 8129.16] P:1735.48 E:0.114438 |  did feel quite ominous as Foden's given it away
[8129.16 - 8131.16] P:1868.85 E:0.115582 |  to Olmol, Olmol then to Yamal,
[8131.16 - 8133.16] P:1832.93 E:0.108880 |  Yamal into the area on the right-shoots,
[8133.16 - 8135.16] P:1914.37 E:0.108106 |  but he was closed down by Marque
[8135.16 - 8137.16] P:1858.91 E:0.111211 |  and that's blocked it out for a Spanish corner,
[8137.16 - 8140.16] P:1802.53 E:0.109018 |  England cannot, England cannot make mistakes like that
[8140.16 - 8141.16] P:1742.89 E:0.106323 |  from Foden.
[8141.16 - 8143.16] P:1683.96 E:0.121687 |  No, really careless from Foden.
[8143.16 - 8146.16] P:1798.65 E:0.114631 |  Under pressure from Rodri, gave the ball straight to Dani Olmol.
[8146.16 - 8148.16] P:1810.56 E:0.112037 |  Corner's taken short to Williams,
[8148.16 - 8150.16] P:1832.70 E:0.108700 |  Williams left for the ball to the edge of the box,
[8150.16 - 8152.16] P:1852.44 E:0.104179 |  that's headed away.
[8152.16 - 8154.16] P:1884.12 E:0.114452 |  John Ston's got it extremely well there
[8154.16 - 8156.16] P:1814.99 E:0.109140 |  and nodded it out to Sacco.
[8156.16 - 8158.16] P:1849.83 E:0.114305 |  I think might have got his heels clipped,
[8158.16 - 8160.16] P:1826.05 E:0.106402 |  that's what the referee says.
[8160.16 - 8162.16] P:1859.20 E:0.118275 |  The French referee says Carvajal,
[8162.16 - 8164.16] P:1871.57 E:0.105711 |  just brought him down and Harry Kane,
[8164.16 - 8167.16] P:1887.81 E:0.109104 |  as the captain has gone over to speak to the French referee
[8167.16 - 8169.16] P:1867.78 E:0.116402 |  and immediately the Spanish players, Carvajal,
[8169.16 - 8172.16] P:1737.95 E:0.110158 |  it was all waving arms and no, no, no,
[8172.16 - 8174.16] P:1773.39 E:0.105999 |  he's made too much more of that.
[8174.16 - 8176.16] P:1729.29 E:0.095424 |  Chris, Matt, what do you think?
[8176.16 - 8179.16] P:1815.58 E:0.105373 |  Well, I think it is a cheeky foul from Carvajal,
[8179.16 - 8181.16] P:1746.11 E:0.111650 |  he's got the wrong side, Sacco is through there
[8181.16 - 8183.16] P:1778.71 E:0.106351 |  and he just clips him and he doesn't cleverly
[8183.16 - 8186.16] P:1761.44 E:0.110787 |  use all that experience and then even looks at the referee
[8186.16 - 8188.16] P:1705.68 E:0.113125 |  as if to say he's making the most of it,
[8188.16 - 8189.16] P:1766.92 E:0.114764 |  but it was certainly cynical
[8189.16 - 8191.16] P:1692.67 E:0.109303 |  and I can understand why Harry Kane's gone over
[8191.16 - 8193.16] P:1787.57 E:0.107962 |  to have a chat with the referee to say,
[8193.16 - 8196.16] P:1629.96 E:0.115883 |  hey, he's got good rhythm, he's the wrong side of him,
[8196.16 - 8198.16] P:1748.08 E:0.100734 |  we're on a breakaway and he clips his heels,
[8198.16 - 8201.16] P:1748.47 E:0.114491 |  it should be a yellow card and I think he may be right.
[8201.16 - 8204.16] P:1789.55 E:0.107659 |  I think the reaction, that's a high foot from Williams on Menu,
[8204.16 - 8206.16] P:1825.30 E:0.115774 |  but Menu keeps his feet, the 19-year-old,
[8206.16 - 8209.16] P:1905.49 E:0.114681 |  lovely change of feet, Kane, Shaw arriving on the left-hand side,
[8209.16 - 8212.16] P:1902.41 E:0.108572 |  Shaw in the challenge, wins a 50-50,
[8212.16 - 8214.16] P:1909.97 E:0.113155 |  still looks Shaw on his right foot now, Menu,
[8214.16 - 8217.16] P:1805.35 E:0.112898 |  the ball runs away and Kukere is able to sweep it away,
[8217.16 - 8222.16] P:1858.41 E:0.110670 |  downfield and when England have probed Chris,
[8222.16 - 8224.16] P:1886.47 E:0.112725 |  they have looked dangerous and here they come again
[8224.16 - 8226.16] P:1913.56 E:0.108158 |  with Sacco on the right-hand side,
[8226.16 - 8228.16] P:1941.42 E:0.109942 |  they've got two men on him, he's tackled back by Morata,
[8228.16 - 8231.16] P:1868.10 E:0.112837 |  Kukere in with the challenge, then Menu plays it spare,
[8231.16 - 8234.16] P:1864.84 E:0.111994 |  Harry Kane in the line, green boots the England captain,
[8234.16 - 8236.16] P:1847.23 E:0.113632 |  under pressure is able to play it forward
[8236.16 - 8239.16] P:1808.49 E:0.118079 |  and has actually been pulled up for sliding into the challenge
[8239.16 - 8242.16] P:1868.55 E:0.111417 |  and it's a yellow card for the England captain,
[8242.16 - 8245.16] P:1895.98 E:0.114056 |  as the Spanish player arrived there,
[8245.16 - 8250.16] P:1804.30 E:0.108078 |  Kane slid into it and referee La Texie has pulled out the yellow card.
[8250.16 - 8253.16] P:1765.94 E:0.111890 |  I actually thought initially that Harry Kane
[8253.16 - 8257.16] P:1809.43 E:0.098457 |  tried to buy a foul was on his way down,
[8257.16 - 8262.16] P:1763.77 E:0.110511 |  this is not a Nudge from Olmo, I'll tell you it's a poor challenge though.
[8262.16 - 8264.16] P:1737.81 E:0.101587 |  He wins the ball though, Chris, didn't he?
[8264.16 - 8269.16] P:1746.21 E:0.107290 |  He does follow through and he catches Fabian Ruiz on his ankle,
[8269.16 - 8271.16] P:1794.26 E:0.109672 |  that's a yellow card offence,
[8271.16 - 8273.16] P:1761.64 E:0.112870 |  he's got to say the dancing feet with Luke Shaw
[8273.16 - 8276.16] P:1727.01 E:0.102167 |  and there's been a fair bit of Kukere la bashing
[8276.16 - 8278.16] P:1696.78 E:0.110451 |  from us this evening,
[8278.16 - 8281.16] P:1720.80 E:0.114286 |  but I'll tell you he's made two timely clearances
[8281.16 - 8283.16] P:1823.15 E:0.108883 |  when England have got forward.
[8283.16 - 8287.16] P:1803.26 E:0.105357 |  Yeah, he's got inside well hasn't he, on that back post,
[8287.16 - 8290.16] P:1723.33 E:0.116357 |  he's anticipated, I mean none of them have been in the air,
[8290.16 - 8293.16] P:1762.91 E:0.110722 |  I think he gets really challenged when the ball's floating into the back post,
[8293.16 - 8296.16] P:1839.24 E:0.108598 |  but on the ground he's took up good positions, he's read it,
[8296.16 - 8298.16] P:1816.73 E:0.111197 |  he's got his body the right side, like you say Chris,
[8298.16 - 8300.16] P:1688.44 E:0.112219 |  he's dealt with it so far in this game.
[8300.16 - 8303.16] P:1692.77 E:0.116749 |  Fabian Ruiz who is on the wrong end of that challenge,
[8303.16 - 8307.16] P:1632.95 E:0.116976 |  as you've said, Kane did get the ball,
[8307.16 - 8310.16] P:1710.57 E:0.115293 |  but did follow through with a foot into his ankle
[8310.16 - 8312.16] P:1684.80 E:0.119794 |  and Fabian Ruiz felt that.
[8312.16 - 8317.16] P:1781.15 E:0.109201 |  Yeah, it was a little bit reckless from Harry Kane.
[8317.16 - 8319.16] P:1874.11 E:0.120585 |  I don't think that's a yellow card Chris personally,
[8319.16 - 8323.16] P:1867.00 E:0.120366 |  I think how can you control your follow through once you've won the ball?
[8323.16 - 8328.16] P:1801.68 E:0.115860 |  Yeah, I get that, but in this day and age,
[8328.16 - 8331.16] P:1675.09 E:0.115483 |  in the 1970s, that then.
[8331.16 - 8334.16] P:1797.75 E:0.099571 |  So that's the first yellow card of this final,
[8334.16 - 8338.16] P:1691.05 E:0.101273 |  the 2024 UEFA European Championship Final,
[8338.16 - 8344.16] P:1599.21 E:0.110929 |  here in Berlin, all of us witnessing something that we've never seen before here tonight,
[8344.16 - 8348.16] P:1664.97 E:0.114451 |  England appearing in a final outside the United Kingdom,
[8348.16 - 8352.16] P:1632.91 E:0.111900 |  outside Wembley Stadium to be absolutely precise.
[8352.16 - 8357.16] P:1630.54 E:0.119442 |  England have been taken to extra time in both of their previous finals,
[8357.16 - 8360.16] P:1885.83 E:0.121461 |  World Cup European Championship,
[8360.16 - 8364.16] P:1730.63 E:0.109021 |  Shaw gets a big round of applause as he puts the ball out of play,
[8364.16 - 8368.16] P:1618.84 E:0.116247 |  Luke Shaw, the only man on the field who scored in a major final,
[8368.16 - 8372.16] P:1599.52 E:0.116230 |  we discovered just before the match when that was pointed out to us.
[8372.16 - 8375.16] P:1700.04 E:0.111815 |  Spain bringing the ball forward from the back.
[8375.16 - 8378.16] P:1688.54 E:0.116993 |  Now, over the course of the entire history of the England national team,
[8378.16 - 8383.16] P:1670.40 E:0.117116 |  only 31 men have played in finals with those who are on the pitch here today,
[8383.16 - 8387.16] P:1704.16 E:0.114659 |  Williams, then Marata, back to Fabian Ruiz who seems OK.
[8387.16 - 8390.16] P:1749.05 E:0.107232 |  Yamal now, just outside the England panel of the area,
[8390.16 - 8393.16] P:1838.48 E:0.111658 |  back to Fabian Ruiz who played it forward, it hit Yamal,
[8393.16 - 8398.16] P:1826.15 E:0.112625 |  back to the area and Mark Gay, who was able to hook it away, facing his own box.
[8398.16 - 8401.16] P:1813.90 E:0.104588 |  The opening stages of the match tonight, Spain dominating it so much,
[8401.16 - 8405.16] P:1867.16 E:0.113019 |  and now here's Fabian Ruiz to the edge of the area, takes a shot, then it comes off.
[8405.16 - 8410.16] P:1925.41 E:0.110841 |  Gay actually took all of the pace off it and it just looked straight through,
[8410.16 - 8413.16] P:1675.93 E:0.109734 |  bounced into the ground to Jordan Pickford.
[8413.16 - 8417.16] P:1716.30 E:0.111813 |  It was dangerous, Fabian. Ruiz is a drifter.
[8417.16 - 8421.16] P:1687.95 E:0.112608 |  Sometimes you'll see him alongside Rodry,
[8421.16 - 8424.16] P:1696.67 E:0.104065 |  often you'll see him drift forward and make those runs.
[8424.16 - 8429.16] P:1618.36 E:0.104253 |  Good little shift initially, the scuffed his shot, deflection,
[8429.16 - 8431.16] P:1600.81 E:0.112033 |  Jordan Pickford gathered easily.
[8431.16 - 8433.16] P:1710.87 E:0.107108 |  Your mouth came inside there, didn't it?
[8433.16 - 8436.16] P:1634.57 E:0.109356 |  Carvajal have made a brilliant run on the overlap,
[8436.16 - 8439.16] P:1829.85 E:0.103813 |  maybe should have just popped it out wide, but he's so desperate
[8439.16 - 8443.16] P:1761.08 E:0.109971 |  to get inside onto his left foot, and so far England have just funneled him into that area,
[8443.16 - 8447.16] P:1710.16 E:0.103019 |  but have got enough bodies in there to not allow him to do anything too creative.
[8447.16 - 8451.16] P:1741.30 E:0.110446 |  Spain, Nill, England, Nill. This is five live from the BBC.
[8451.16 - 8454.16] P:1722.90 E:0.109558 |  They're on the move on this Sunday night, their BBC sounds,
[8454.16 - 8458.16] P:1803.27 E:0.111846 |  and we're on the World Service as well, all around the globe,
[8458.16 - 8462.16] P:1715.39 E:0.108027 |  and as Ian said, BFBS are very welcome to our coverage tonight too.
[8462.16 - 8466.16] P:1786.66 E:0.111282 |  Pickford all in yellow, long downfield from the England goalkeeper, Bellingham.
[8466.16 - 8471.16] P:1798.70 E:0.104986 |  The Real Madrid mad up against Spain, carries the ball out towards the left-hand side,
[8471.16 - 8475.16] P:1775.62 E:0.106218 |  but couldn't keep it in and it's a throw into Spain ten yards back from the corner flag.
[8475.16 - 8479.16] P:1777.65 E:0.106796 |  Yep, Spain look exactly what they are, Chris, a team that has been in great form
[8479.16 - 8483.16] P:1654.81 E:0.107306 |  with great confidence and have won all of their matches, some of them handsomely.
[8483.16 - 8485.16] P:1612.38 E:0.104151 |  Yep, absolutely.
[8487.16 - 8490.16] P:1870.48 E:0.119049 |  I mean, they're in pretty dominant in this game so far,
[8490.16 - 8494.16] P:1736.62 E:0.105837 |  but England have limited them to very few efforts.
[8494.16 - 8496.16] P:1665.87 E:0.108057 |  I think we had the shot from Javier Mouy,
[8496.16 - 8499.16] P:1714.09 E:0.113613 |  so I think all in all Garret's out gate will be satisfied.
[8499.16 - 8502.16] P:1794.49 E:0.108471 |  Already the first half hour of this final has whizzed by,
[8502.16 - 8506.16] P:1648.30 E:0.109106 |  Thornton chasing around, but the ball's played back to the goalkeeper,
[8506.16 - 8510.16] P:1693.12 E:0.105556 |  Unaiz Simon, who's got an excellent penalty-saving record,
[8510.16 - 8513.16] P:1636.93 E:0.114377 |  incidentally, Unaiz Simon even better than Jordan Pickford.
[8513.16 - 8517.16] P:1796.13 E:0.107336 |  Here's Kane, 30 yards out, but in comes the challenge and that just carries it through.
[8517.16 - 8522.16] P:1769.65 E:0.111466 |  And back to the Spanish goalkeeper, number 23, you can see that brightly now,
[8522.16 - 8527.16] P:1632.56 E:0.113645 |  that number on the back of his black shirt, the floodlights of this brilliant stadium,
[8527.16 - 8531.16] P:1715.20 E:0.115136 |  just beginning to take effect, massive oval ball,
[8531.16 - 8535.16] P:1775.54 E:0.109615 |  summer sky above, that huge gap at one end,
[8535.16 - 8540.16] P:1709.06 E:0.116907 |  as Williams with a flick through the middle, and then Morata didn't get the,
[8540.16 - 8544.16] P:1801.86 E:0.109288 |  the sort of round the corner pass on it that he wanted to, to Olmore,
[8544.16 - 8548.16] P:1627.64 E:0.108563 |  so Pickford is able to play it out from the back and then walk out of the halfway line,
[8548.16 - 8551.16] P:1593.52 E:0.109517 |  but that's headed forward by Rodry, the Manchester City man,
[8551.16 - 8554.16] P:1814.99 E:0.113937 |  and then Olmore in on the challenge, that looked like a high foot it was,
[8554.16 - 8557.16] P:1863.93 E:0.113939 |  says the referee, by Olmore, and that'll be a free kick.
[8557.16 - 8559.16] P:1857.70 E:0.121171 |  I think it was Rice who was on the other end of that,
[8559.16 - 8562.16] P:1919.34 E:0.114459 |  and then adds a yellow card for Olmore as well.
[8562.16 - 8566.16] P:1939.15 E:0.109426 |  I think, I think that the base of his foot made contact with Declan Rice.
[8566.16 - 8570.16] P:1808.33 E:0.112296 |  Yeah, I feel like it. I mean, another look on the monitor,
[8570.16 - 8573.16] P:1793.80 E:0.102226 |  but I suspect it's a similar one to Harry Kane,
[8573.16 - 8576.16] P:1751.18 E:0.104007 |  and he received his yellow.
[8576.16 - 8578.16] P:1641.60 E:0.108706 |  He's unhappy about it, Danny Olmore.
[8578.16 - 8580.16] P:1830.02 E:0.102659 |  Oh yeah, Kickland, that's a mid-trip.
[8580.16 - 8582.16] P:1671.66 E:0.104364 |  It's a poor challenge, actually.
[8582.16 - 8583.16] P:1698.82 E:0.111001 |  It's a poor challenge.
[8583.16 - 8584.16] P:1559.33 E:0.106215 |  Olmore.
[8584.16 - 8585.16] P:1825.70 E:0.104351 |  Yeah.
[8585.16 - 8586.16] P:1800.85 E:0.131462 |  Very high.
[8586.16 - 8589.16] P:1680.84 E:0.101134 |  I'll tell you, maybe having a look at that.
[8589.16 - 8591.16] P:1636.25 E:0.111082 |  We might have a look at it.
[8591.16 - 8596.16] P:1651.71 E:0.107210 |  I suspect that stick with the referee's decision, don't you?
[8596.16 - 8599.16] P:1641.21 E:0.107733 |  Oh, that's, I mean, that's quite a high boot.
[8599.16 - 8606.16] P:1783.22 E:0.103219 |  He's thrown his studs into Declan Rice's thigh high up.
[8606.16 - 8607.16] P:1754.59 E:0.105971 |  That's a poor scowling from.
[8607.16 - 8608.16] P:1704.48 E:0.099540 |  It's a hit from, isn't it?
[8608.16 - 8611.16] P:1742.57 E:0.103776 |  I mean, he's practically hit by where that boot's gone.
[8611.16 - 8612.16] P:1761.94 E:0.115879 |  Let's go down to pitch side,
[8612.16 - 8613.16] P:1713.71 E:0.109056 |  and I think you could see that, Izzy, as well.
[8613.16 - 8614.16] P:1523.68 E:0.118352 |  Is that your rend?
[8614.16 - 8617.16] P:1591.96 E:0.116598 |  Yeah, I've not had the luxury of a replay,
[8617.16 - 8619.16] P:1644.15 E:0.104217 |  but I thought Declan Rice was quite clever,
[8619.16 - 8622.16] P:1532.73 E:0.113711 |  because he went down early on the angle,
[8622.16 - 8623.16] P:1670.47 E:0.111355 |  just to get his body in the way,
[8623.16 - 8625.16] P:1539.74 E:0.113736 |  and I can see what Danny Olmore's trying to do.
[8625.16 - 8627.16] P:1612.58 E:0.110473 |  He's trying to chop the ball on the half-turn.
[8627.16 - 8631.16] P:1621.75 E:0.107129 |  But it sounds up there, Chris, like it was a bad challenge.
[8631.16 - 8633.16] P:1675.13 E:0.115890 |  Is he going to get sent off for that half an hour
[8633.16 - 8635.16] P:1842.39 E:0.122472 |  into a big, your way for sure, piece of it?
[8635.16 - 8636.16] P:1867.06 E:0.106764 |  Well...
[8636.16 - 8639.16] P:1689.20 E:0.111889 |  What are you saying, John?
[8639.16 - 8640.16] P:1764.28 E:0.117293 |  I just posed the question.
[8640.16 - 8641.16] P:1466.39 E:0.107834 |  That's what this is.
[8641.16 - 8643.16] P:1533.61 E:0.114275 |  That's a very poor challenge.
[8643.16 - 8646.16] P:1701.48 E:0.113764 |  But it's not quite got the intent, though, has it?
[8646.16 - 8647.16] P:1672.51 E:0.113329 |  I mean, it is a bit...
[8647.16 - 8649.16] P:1737.60 E:0.113902 |  It's very scruffy to have your foot that high,
[8649.16 - 8652.16] P:1749.97 E:0.108380 |  but I don't think the intent is there.
[8652.16 - 8654.16] P:1688.80 E:0.109762 |  I think he left a bit on him, mate.
[8654.16 - 8656.16] P:1795.55 E:0.093510 |  Yeah, he gets his yellow card for that.
[8656.16 - 8657.16] P:1642.39 E:0.092630 |  Here's Bellingham.
[8657.16 - 8661.16] P:1748.11 E:0.122813 |  Bellingham now just moves away as the challenge comes in
[8661.16 - 8663.16] P:1784.19 E:0.120711 |  on him from Rodry,
[8663.16 - 8666.16] P:1864.83 E:0.116012 |  and the referee says,
[8666.16 - 8667.16] P:1830.70 E:0.111715 |  yeah, that's a free kick.
[8667.16 - 8671.16] P:1875.97 E:0.110099 |  Well, you can't give a foul, in my opinion,
[8671.16 - 8673.16] P:1840.09 E:0.120619 |  when he gave the foul.
[8673.16 - 8675.16] P:1838.99 E:0.112863 |  There was an earlier tug on Bellingham,
[8675.16 - 8677.16] P:1781.61 E:0.115988 |  whose feet were brilliant, little pirouette,
[8677.16 - 8679.16] P:1799.05 E:0.103719 |  but then he stayed in control,
[8679.16 - 8682.16] P:1745.15 E:0.097616 |  gave the ball away, and the referee blew up.
[8682.16 - 8685.16] P:1701.70 E:0.115386 |  Stornes plays a bansong pass out to Shaw on the left-hand side.
[8685.16 - 8687.16] P:1773.57 E:0.102468 |  Luke Shaw now, attacking the penalty area,
[8687.16 - 8689.16] P:1727.08 E:0.115383 |  winning his 34th cap tonight,
[8689.16 - 8692.16] P:1771.61 E:0.111453 |  and then Shaw loses possession near the edge of the box,
[8692.16 - 8694.16] P:1707.83 E:0.120518 |  and there's Fabian Ruiz under pressure, as well,
[8694.16 - 8696.16] P:1634.71 E:0.109000 |  and turns it back into the penalty area.
[8696.16 - 8700.16] P:1697.13 E:0.121107 |  And I think there's been contact between Fabian Ruiz
[8700.16 - 8702.16] P:1761.16 E:0.108682 |  and Phil Fordham now, as well.
[8702.16 - 8704.16] P:1752.42 E:0.105582 |  And we're going to have another little stoppage.
[8704.16 - 8706.16] P:1719.76 E:0.119764 |  It was just as Fabian Ruiz turned back and played it back.
[8706.16 - 8707.16] P:1652.35 E:0.115007 |  The two of them came together.
[8707.16 - 8709.16] P:1816.00 E:0.110266 |  Yeah, Fordham tried to pick his pocket.
[8709.16 - 8711.16] P:1767.54 E:0.114400 |  He didn't know who's there, Fabian Ruiz,
[8711.16 - 8713.16] P:1775.42 E:0.118163 |  and it was actually a little bit unlucky,
[8713.16 - 8715.16] P:1608.62 E:0.111827 |  because that ball could have popped out anywhere.
[8715.16 - 8717.16] P:1536.49 E:0.123559 |  It ends up back with Simon in goal,
[8717.16 - 8719.16] P:1613.78 E:0.123173 |  but Fordham very nearly forced the mistake there
[8719.16 - 8721.16] P:1573.66 E:0.116295 |  from Fabian Ruiz.
[8721.16 - 8724.16] P:1707.46 E:0.118296 |  It's another very tactical game of international football,
[8724.16 - 8726.16] P:1751.49 E:0.115490 |  this between these sides, as Chris has mentioned.
[8726.16 - 8728.16] P:1601.13 E:0.117261 |  England dropping into a back four,
[8728.16 - 8730.16] P:1795.30 E:0.115478 |  and then sometimes you look at it and you think
[8730.16 - 8733.16] P:1699.31 E:0.118056 |  it almost looks like 4-4-2 with Bellingham on the left-hand side
[8733.16 - 8736.16] P:1574.93 E:0.116983 |  and Fordham up through the middle with Harry Kane,
[8736.16 - 8740.16] P:1604.85 E:0.113678 |  Williams, the Spanish in their red shirts with the yellow trim,
[8740.16 - 8744.16] P:1548.12 E:0.117851 |  quite baggy blue shorts, as well, with the yellow and red trim,
[8744.16 - 8748.16] P:1496.59 E:0.114550 |  and he has L'Enormand, Robin L'Enormand,
[8748.16 - 8751.16] P:1578.83 E:0.115615 |  who plays the ball to another former Manchester City man,
[8751.16 - 8753.16] P:1633.46 E:0.120180 |  Laporte, who's carried the ball on now,
[8753.16 - 8755.16] P:1590.07 E:0.117528 |  deep into England territory.
[8755.16 - 8758.16] P:1395.85 E:0.116821 |  And then there's Jack O'Rea, a little flurry of booze for him
[8758.16 - 8760.16] P:1603.81 E:0.117890 |  from the German fans, and then Ruiz.
[8760.16 - 8762.16] P:1619.71 E:0.110988 |  He has Carvajal over there on the right-hand side.
[8762.16 - 8765.16] P:1530.32 E:0.114003 |  Remember him scoring the opening goal in the Champions League final
[8765.16 - 8768.16] P:1751.28 E:0.116425 |  at Wembley. Now Yermal on the right-hand side, takes on Shaw,
[8768.16 - 8770.16] P:1850.82 E:0.115762 |  and Shaw goes with him and just gets a foot in to put it behind
[8770.16 - 8772.16] P:1928.10 E:0.106137 |  for a Spanish corner.
[8772.16 - 8774.16] P:1791.57 E:0.119388 |  He does really well, Shaw.
[8774.16 - 8777.16] P:1798.22 E:0.110747 |  Clever from Yermal, drives the outside.
[8777.16 - 8780.16] P:1707.34 E:0.110443 |  We know he likes to come inside on his left foot,
[8780.16 - 8783.16] P:1665.65 E:0.116387 |  but takes Luke Shaw to the byline.
[8783.16 - 8785.16] P:1786.68 E:0.107596 |  First from Luke Shaw,
[8785.16 - 8787.16] P:1705.06 E:0.106691 |  and pokes it behind for a corner.
[8787.16 - 8790.16] P:1772.63 E:0.112286 |  It was a little moment there where I thought he had the half-yard,
[8790.16 - 8792.16] P:1807.80 E:0.101410 |  but he just recovered, didn't he?
[8792.16 - 8795.16] P:1757.20 E:0.113430 |  He did. Shaw did well, looked it out against Yermal,
[8795.16 - 8798.16] P:1639.81 E:0.124478 |  who tonight becomes the youngest man to appear
[8798.16 - 8801.16] P:1721.20 E:0.111562 |  in a European Championship or World Cup final.
[8801.16 - 8805.16] P:1900.71 E:0.111521 |  The Spanish corner is in, and there were bodies falling all over the place,
[8805.16 - 8808.16] P:1715.28 E:0.115141 |  and in the end, it's hit, I think, one of the England defenders,
[8808.16 - 8811.16] P:1677.58 E:0.111561 |  I think possibly gay, bounced behind, and after all of that,
[8811.16 - 8814.16] P:1705.66 E:0.105302 |  I thought that must be a cert that that would be given as a free-kick.
[8814.16 - 8817.16] P:1685.50 E:0.111188 |  I think LeMortland, LeNormand's disappointed
[8817.16 - 8819.16] P:1748.44 E:0.114406 |  because he was in the best position to attack this,
[8819.16 - 8822.16] P:1735.89 E:0.117961 |  he gets a good run at it, Rice has his arm over.
[8822.16 - 8825.16] P:1874.96 E:0.115660 |  He's got to be careful, Declan Rice.
[8825.16 - 8827.16] P:1842.46 E:0.105939 |  That could be trouble, Chris,
[8827.16 - 8829.16] P:1778.06 E:0.121890 |  because he really does grapple into the floor off the board.
[8829.16 - 8833.16] P:1824.55 E:0.114954 |  That's a worry, Rice on LePort,
[8833.16 - 8836.16] P:1787.51 E:0.119689 |  and the referee blows his whistle.
[8836.16 - 8840.16] P:1701.00 E:0.111608 |  It is possible that VAR could call the referee's attention to that.
[8840.16 - 8842.16] P:1577.22 E:0.103881 |  There's no doubt.
[8842.16 - 8844.16] P:1653.05 E:0.115361 |  Well, Rice isn't facing the correct way,
[8844.16 - 8846.16] P:1660.64 E:0.122346 |  he's not looking at the ball,
[8846.16 - 8848.16] P:1786.79 E:0.103649 |  or he wasn't looking at the ball, looking at the man.
[8848.16 - 8850.16] P:1748.32 E:0.109647 |  Corner, taken short on the left-hand side,
[8850.16 - 8852.16] P:1696.37 E:0.110016 |  second consecutive Spanish corner,
[8852.16 - 8854.16] P:1798.17 E:0.117343 |  it's played back out to the edge of the area.
[8854.16 - 8857.16] P:1783.76 E:0.110913 |  Ormore with a low shot, that's blocked by Cain inside his own penalty area.
[8857.16 - 8860.16] P:1807.80 E:0.111926 |  Cain trying to pass it away, which he does up to Manu,
[8860.16 - 8862.16] P:1740.51 E:0.121412 |  who keeps the ball in up against Ormore,
[8862.16 - 8864.16] P:1827.71 E:0.110793 |  but Ormore's the favourite to get there,
[8864.16 - 8866.16] P:1823.23 E:0.113337 |  just in front of where Garry Southgate is pacing.
[8866.16 - 8868.16] P:1839.88 E:0.107038 |  And then Ormore turns, brings it forward for Spain,
[8868.16 - 8870.16] P:1775.26 E:0.115391 |  and then Nel Nel Nel if you just switched on.
[8870.16 - 8872.16] P:1715.08 E:0.112502 |  The match is on BBC One tonight.
[8872.16 - 8876.16] P:1578.40 E:0.111213 |  You can see it there, watch it again on the iPlayer,
[8876.16 - 8879.16] P:1704.09 E:0.116027 |  the same way that you could listen to our commentaries again
[8879.16 - 8882.16] P:1613.54 E:0.124737 |  via BBC Sounds or rewind the live radio.
[8882.16 - 8888.16] P:1743.05 E:0.125533 |  Spain with Rodry, Rodry, then to the number eight, Fabian Ruiz.
[8888.16 - 8894.16] P:1754.88 E:0.119090 |  Unbeaten for Spain, Fabio Ruiz, and this is his 29th cap.
[8894.16 - 8897.16] P:1682.76 E:0.112599 |  Now it's being brought forward from the back by Lundor Mande,
[8897.16 - 8899.16] P:1719.61 E:0.108982 |  Carvajal is over there on the far side,
[8899.16 - 8901.16] P:1660.76 E:0.109706 |  a Spain attack towards the end,
[8901.16 - 8903.16] P:1610.65 E:0.113544 |  holding the bulk of the England supporters.
[8903.16 - 8906.16] P:1700.00 E:0.109468 |  Now Cucarrea, with all of that hair bobbing.
[8906.16 - 8909.16] P:1661.42 E:0.110768 |  More hair now on the left-hand side, with Williams.
[8909.16 - 8912.16] P:1630.43 E:0.115886 |  Williams right footed, but that's over everyone in Shaw.
[8912.16 - 8917.16] P:1866.05 E:0.117731 |  A little bit like what we might see from England players
[8917.16 - 8919.16] P:1811.71 E:0.110954 |  at Trent Bridge this coming week,
[8919.16 - 8922.16] P:1733.95 E:0.109945 |  just let it go by outside the off-stump for a goal kick.
[8922.16 - 8926.16] P:1670.79 E:0.110313 |  I just think the distance that Karl Walker gets there
[8926.16 - 8928.16] P:1681.71 E:0.111531 |  is spot on at the moment with Williams.
[8928.16 - 8931.16] P:1685.68 E:0.118039 |  He's a tricky customer, but he's keeping him in areas
[8931.16 - 8934.16] P:1684.53 E:0.114556 |  where he can't get into really top-notch crossing positions.
[8934.16 - 8936.16] P:1611.24 E:0.117198 |  That one there was a bit hopeful, it was very deep.
[8936.16 - 8938.16] P:1742.60 E:0.112433 |  He kind of just chips it to that back post.
[8938.16 - 8941.16] P:1669.66 E:0.118930 |  He's not allowing him to get his head up and get any rhythm.
[8941.16 - 8944.16] P:1736.30 E:0.110334 |  He's doing a good job in that right back position, Karl Walker.
[8944.16 - 8947.16] P:1781.53 E:0.121933 |  It is Spain nil, England nil in the final here in Berlin.
[8947.16 - 8949.16] P:1759.37 E:0.107974 |  And on the subject of other sports,
[8949.16 - 8951.16] P:1624.71 E:0.112905 |  a very good win for Robert McIntyre
[8951.16 - 8953.16] P:1762.61 E:0.109339 |  in the Scottish Open this evening
[8953.16 - 8956.16] P:1773.22 E:0.104381 |  by one shot from Adam Scott to set him up
[8956.16 - 8959.16] P:1776.03 E:0.107030 |  for the Open Championship at Trun next week.
[8959.16 - 8962.16] P:1687.12 E:0.111339 |  So Robert McIntyre winning on home soil
[8962.16 - 8964.16] P:1651.92 E:0.109428 |  and will have the Open fully covered for you
[8964.16 - 8967.16] P:1655.88 E:0.109367 |  on Thursday on Five Live.
[8967.16 - 8970.16] P:1714.96 E:0.109414 |  Here Spain come forward, ball on the right-hand side.
[8970.16 - 8972.16] P:1716.66 E:0.119390 |  Williams has now switched over onto the right flank
[8972.16 - 8973.16] P:1757.44 E:0.111336 |  for the time being.
[8973.16 - 8976.16] P:1702.19 E:0.113223 |  And Nico Williams then back towards Carvajal, who's behind him.
[8976.16 - 8980.16] P:1583.90 E:0.110215 |  Carvajal lifts a pass to the halfway line, Le Porte.
[8980.16 - 8983.16] P:1799.49 E:0.111807 |  And now, Saudi-based,
[8983.16 - 8986.16] P:1589.21 E:0.115342 |  Emerick Le Porte takes that down, plays it infield towards Rodry.
[8986.16 - 8989.16] P:1573.08 E:0.119262 |  And then Rodry, one of those economical passes from him.
[8989.16 - 8992.16] P:1680.55 E:0.116142 |  Williams still on the right-hand side up against Shaw.
[8992.16 - 8994.16] P:1678.20 E:0.109543 |  Williams reversing into the penalty area.
[8994.16 - 8996.16] P:1605.88 E:0.109563 |  Now Yamael is there. Yamael still in the box.
[8996.16 - 8998.16] P:1672.12 E:0.121439 |  That's blocked away by Ballingham.
[8998.16 - 9000.16] P:1759.71 E:0.113927 |  He's second favourite to get there, Ballingham.
[9000.16 - 9003.16] P:1752.28 E:0.114054 |  In comes the challenge from Lonewot. No man, he wins that back.
[9003.16 - 9004.16] P:1763.68 E:0.111784 |  Cross from Carvajal,
[9004.16 - 9006.16] P:1679.23 E:0.117403 |  is blocked on the edge of the England penalty area.
[9006.16 - 9009.16] P:1741.49 E:0.121233 |  Then Carvajal gets up, heads it down to Yamael,
[9009.16 - 9011.16] P:1613.36 E:0.114820 |  to way over there on the right wing.
[9011.16 - 9013.16] P:1765.86 E:0.118478 |  Left for the ball into the box, that's blocked by Shaw,
[9013.16 - 9014.16] P:1682.94 E:0.110618 |  blocked it out to Ballingham.
[9014.16 - 9017.16] P:1771.91 E:0.116522 |  Ballingham brilliantly manages to go past.
[9017.16 - 9020.16] P:1817.59 E:0.121357 |  One challenge from Rodry, then goes down.
[9020.16 - 9023.16] P:1759.93 E:0.109278 |  Spain have got it back, they're building some momentum here.
[9023.16 - 9025.16] P:1744.47 E:0.111081 |  38 minutes played in the first half.
[9025.16 - 9027.16] P:1709.20 E:0.117727 |  And then the cross from Travian Ruiz,
[9027.16 - 9029.16] P:1823.68 E:0.113027 |  but that's all that everyone, whether in white or red,
[9029.16 - 9031.16] P:1842.65 E:0.118636 |  in the box, and it's a goal kick to England, Chris.
[9031.16 - 9034.16] P:1793.53 E:0.114229 |  Yeah, it's been that final ball which has let Spain down,
[9034.16 - 9036.16] P:1612.01 E:0.111953 |  time and time again.
[9036.16 - 9041.16] P:1668.76 E:0.116625 |  Another cross, well, diagonal pass over, hit there.
[9041.16 - 9044.16] P:1606.94 E:0.117369 |  England clever little nutmeg from Ballingham,
[9044.16 - 9049.16] P:1726.54 E:0.113545 |  on Rodry, but didn't have any players forward from him.
[9049.16 - 9053.16] P:1703.70 E:0.119577 |  No man, running the ball back, it's wave after wave,
[9053.16 - 9056.16] P:1711.56 E:0.111861 |  but England at this moment in time, stifling Spain.
[9056.16 - 9058.16] P:1647.09 E:0.112601 |  Yes, that's what they're doing.
[9058.16 - 9060.16] P:1536.38 E:0.116534 |  You'll have enjoyed that, Ballingham.
[9060.16 - 9062.16] P:1594.07 E:0.115153 |  The nutmeg on the great Rodry.
[9062.16 - 9066.16] P:1674.69 E:0.119340 |  Here is Manu, just holding the ball up.
[9066.16 - 9071.16] P:1818.05 E:0.117294 |  It's the first time, we've had two teenagers starting the final like this,
[9071.16 - 9075.16] P:1735.57 E:0.111251 |  as it's played back by Stones at pace to Pickford,
[9075.16 - 9079.16] P:1779.54 E:0.112734 |  who had to control that under pressure, but cleared it away.
[9079.16 - 9082.16] P:1777.70 E:0.113331 |  First time two teenagers have started in a final like this,
[9082.16 - 9085.16] P:1704.00 E:0.116326 |  World Cup, European Championship, Yamao and England's Manu.
[9085.16 - 9088.16] P:1760.61 E:0.121255 |  Williams with a flick, tried to flick it past Walker,
[9088.16 - 9090.16] P:1771.04 E:0.115028 |  but Walker was just able to get something on that.
[9090.16 - 9093.16] P:1597.25 E:0.122171 |  He seems OK after that early problem that he had with Walker.
[9093.16 - 9096.16] P:1791.11 E:0.114852 |  And now, he has filled for him desperately unlucky,
[9096.16 - 9099.16] P:1756.58 E:0.114030 |  not to have scored or been involved in a goal so far at these Euros,
[9099.16 - 9102.16] P:1680.03 E:0.113091 |  particularly in the semifinal against the Netherlands.
[9102.16 - 9105.16] P:1622.01 E:0.119161 |  England going back towards the halfway line.
[9105.16 - 9109.16] P:1852.55 E:0.120786 |  England trying to win something for the first time since, you know, when,
[9109.16 - 9112.16] P:1934.10 E:0.118779 |  and trying to win this competition for the first time.
[9112.16 - 9115.16] P:1935.90 E:0.122817 |  Most of the great nations have won the Euros,
[9115.16 - 9117.16] P:1951.44 E:0.116152 |  but not England.
[9117.16 - 9121.16] P:1899.72 E:0.122931 |  Walker on the halfway line goes in field towards Stones.
[9121.16 - 9124.16] P:1893.81 E:0.122175 |  Stones then just drops a shoulder, takes it away from Marata.
[9124.16 - 9128.16] P:1885.91 E:0.115117 |  Stones then strides forward, the Manchester City defender, still going Stones.
[9128.16 - 9131.16] P:1930.10 E:0.107648 |  Tried to slip the pass forward towards Harry Kane.
[9131.16 - 9133.16] P:1817.07 E:0.110428 |  Spain had too many numbers in there,
[9133.16 - 9136.16] P:1830.53 E:0.115108 |  and now Stones is out of position as Spain break forward with Williams.
[9136.16 - 9139.16] P:1787.51 E:0.106318 |  Williams in the centre circle, telling him, tackling back,
[9139.16 - 9141.16] P:1777.90 E:0.107392 |  but he managed to get the pass to Yamao.
[9141.16 - 9144.16] P:1770.18 E:0.112105 |  Yamao with Luxure, tight on him, uses Williams,
[9144.16 - 9146.16] P:1779.74 E:0.107912 |  two of the McClose quarters.
[9146.16 - 9150.16] P:1766.13 E:0.116120 |  Williams and Yamao, these two exciting white players that Spain
[9150.16 - 9154.16] P:1833.67 E:0.117489 |  have used to the full at this tournament, still male-male,
[9154.16 - 9159.16] P:1726.60 E:0.115584 |  half-time approaching, Kukareya back to the halfway line, towards La Porte,
[9159.16 - 9164.16] P:1757.97 E:0.114598 |  and then La Porte goes to his fellow French-born central defender,
[9164.16 - 9169.16] P:1629.37 E:0.114700 |  as the name suggests, Lino Mand, with the ball at his feet,
[9169.16 - 9172.16] P:1637.24 E:0.114784 |  big mop of hair, then through to Olmaw,
[9172.16 - 9176.16] P:1735.96 E:0.109630 |  flexed out to the far side, Williams is still over there on the right flank,
[9176.16 - 9183.16] P:1702.08 E:0.111478 |  Carvajal puts his foot on the ball, the wily, much-decorated Danny Carvajal,
[9183.16 - 9186.16] P:1714.44 E:0.119210 |  missed the semi-final after his sending off against the Germans,
[9186.16 - 9189.16] P:1716.43 E:0.119777 |  wins the throw-in, then Yamao's able to take it on,
[9189.16 - 9191.16] P:1739.41 E:0.113455 |  showed too much of that to Foden who put in the challenge,
[9191.16 - 9194.16] P:1737.92 E:0.117436 |  broke down for the Spanish, but it comes back to the red shirts again,
[9194.16 - 9197.16] P:1758.26 E:0.119700 |  then Rodry through the middle, that's excellently won by Rice,
[9197.16 - 9199.16] P:1753.25 E:0.111900 |  and now it's the white shirt who are coming forward,
[9199.16 - 9202.16] P:1778.55 E:0.111475 |  brought on by these thousands and thousands of England fans in the stadium,
[9202.16 - 9205.16] P:1763.83 E:0.111254 |  here in Berlin, ball on the left-hand side with Bellingham,
[9205.16 - 9207.16] P:1777.56 E:0.108987 |  misplaced pass, however, it comes back to Kane,
[9207.16 - 9211.16] P:1853.09 E:0.115336 |  Kane hits one of those curling passes, he had a sacre on the right-hand side,
[9211.16 - 9214.16] P:1817.13 E:0.111644 |  he's got him one-on-one now, sacre against Kukareya,
[9214.16 - 9217.16] P:1657.82 E:0.120100 |  but details well, Kukareya, low ball from Manu into the edge of the area,
[9217.16 - 9220.16] P:1802.00 E:0.111404 |  nice thinking, but it was intercepted,
[9220.16 - 9225.16] P:1644.21 E:0.119498 |  and now the Spanish sweep-down field, the momentum of the game is just increasing here,
[9225.16 - 9228.16] P:1621.56 E:0.117405 |  a little bit of end-to-end, but Spain with it inside their own half.
[9228.16 - 9235.16] P:1777.55 E:0.119544 |  Yeah, Walker has got to say his recovery run from near the Spanish byline,
[9235.16 - 9241.16] P:1826.17 E:0.113974 |  all the way back because Williams had broken out, that was wonderful to watch.
[9241.16 - 9245.16] P:1765.92 E:0.118036 |  Spain again come down the right, but that's all by hit by Yamael,
[9245.16 - 9247.16] P:1746.28 E:0.116064 |  and it's out of play for a throwing to England.
[9247.16 - 9251.16] P:1749.01 E:0.114523 |  I've just been told Chris that England have just completed their 100th pass
[9251.16 - 9256.16] P:1794.77 E:0.111872 |  in the 40th minute, Spain are currently up to 257 completing.
[9256.16 - 9262.16] P:1760.10 E:0.117004 |  Yeah, well let's get the bunting out for England, 100 passes, completed.
[9262.16 - 9268.16] P:1819.00 E:0.119420 |  I've got to say, I've seen Spain a lot in this tournament, it's the most ineffective.
[9268.16 - 9275.16] P:1695.87 E:0.115286 |  I've seen the Spanish wide players, Yamael and Williams, who have been their go-to guys.
[9275.16 - 9279.16] P:1648.91 E:0.120482 |  The biggest problem you can give Karl Walker is that Williams has ended up disappearing on the other side
[9279.16 - 9283.16] P:1738.00 E:0.114284 |  of the pitch to try and get some joy, and he's not really getting too much from him
[9283.16 - 9287.16] P:1572.11 E:0.114176 |  in one-on-one situations, but you've got to admire the way Spain do in the ball.
[9287.16 - 9291.16] P:1637.39 E:0.117730 |  We can't get passes in because when it turns over, we're a little bit stretched,
[9291.16 - 9295.16] P:1731.08 E:0.121946 |  and there's four or five red shirts just hunting the ball down, it's impressive to see.
[9295.16 - 9299.16] P:1771.91 E:0.120046 |  That's a nice ball for it into the penalty area for Marata, who might get an opportunity,
[9299.16 - 9303.16] P:1832.37 E:0.108124 |  but actually Mark Gade did exceptionally well when I thought he was past in there,
[9303.16 - 9307.16] P:1742.30 E:0.114238 |  and John Stolz helped out as well, and in the end, between them,
[9307.16 - 9312.16] P:1731.60 E:0.116159 |  they were able to deflect it behind off Marata for what is a corner in the end off Stolz.
[9312.16 - 9315.16] P:1629.01 E:0.119209 |  There's a little split-second there where Gade, he's in the right position,
[9315.16 - 9320.16] P:1737.02 E:0.113980 |  but Marata just flicks it past the flady leg of Gade, he tries to get around the other side,
[9320.16 - 9323.16] P:1754.10 E:0.116471 |  but he does well with his body, gets his arms out, makes himself big,
[9323.16 - 9327.16] P:1639.28 E:0.113616 |  and difficult to get around in the box, and he's set in the back part of Stolz,
[9327.16 - 9330.16] P:1704.79 E:0.119583 |  just comes across and pokes it out for a corner.
[9330.16 - 9334.16] P:1711.81 E:0.111081 |  It's corner number six to the Spanish, still 0-0.
[9334.16 - 9338.16] P:1705.87 E:0.114246 |  Williams takes it into the edge of the six-yard box, that's headed across the area for England.
[9338.16 - 9343.16] P:1570.90 E:0.115727 |  Maynou's able to get that down, Fabian Riz is putting pressure on the Manchester United teenager,
[9343.16 - 9349.16] P:1795.50 E:0.118045 |  he's still got it there, and then it's played out by Fabian Riz for the goal kick.
[9349.16 - 9354.16] P:1731.51 E:0.119080 |  So Spain, Nill, England, Nill, all across the BBC tonight.
[9354.16 - 9358.16] P:1786.80 E:0.116114 |  I hope you've enjoyed our coverage of the Euros across all of the various platforms.
[9358.16 - 9362.16] P:1778.25 E:0.116094 |  I hope you might even have been out here and experienced it for yourself.
[9362.16 - 9364.16] P:1630.97 E:0.113140 |  It's certainly been memorable.
[9364.16 - 9369.16] P:1785.53 E:0.113453 |  Sometimes the football hasn't been the absolute best and the most thrilling.
[9369.16 - 9374.16] P:1745.55 E:0.118646 |  The match is on BBC One, and if you like, you can listen to our coverage.
[9374.16 - 9377.16] P:1765.15 E:0.113593 |  The radio commentary synced up with the pictures.
[9377.16 - 9381.16] P:1708.00 E:0.119244 |  If you go to your red button or the i-player and look for Euros extra,
[9381.16 - 9384.16] P:1746.66 E:0.110109 |  and there will be a six-or-six tonight as well with you and Robbie Chris
[9384.16 - 9388.16] P:1665.39 E:0.109484 |  on five live after the end of the match, however long it takes.
[9388.16 - 9390.16] P:1554.32 E:0.111852 |  Yep, let's hope it's a cheery one.
[9390.16 - 9393.16] P:1662.89 E:0.106888 |  Let's hope it's a cheery one, just like Christmas.
[9393.16 - 9396.16] P:1667.24 E:0.112901 |  Here's Carvajal, being put under pressure by Bellingham.
[9396.16 - 9399.16] P:1828.56 E:0.110540 |  Bellingham's dispossessed in the middle. Bellingham finds Kane.
[9399.16 - 9402.16] P:1817.13 E:0.109551 |  Kane shot his block. It'll bounce out though to Walker.
[9402.16 - 9405.16] P:1883.93 E:0.118626 |  Walker will get there first and he's been bundled over by Williams.
[9405.16 - 9407.16] P:1899.52 E:0.117942 |  That was a real sprint.
[9407.16 - 9409.16] P:1876.25 E:0.117785 |  It was a proper race, shoulder to shoulder,
[9409.16 - 9412.16] P:1819.77 E:0.111570 |  and Walker says, how about that for a yellow card to the referee,
[9412.16 - 9414.16] P:1656.63 E:0.115668 |  but it's just going to be a free kick, I think.
[9414.16 - 9417.16] P:1736.33 E:0.117466 |  I think he's been the best player on the pitch in this first half, Carl Walker.
[9417.16 - 9419.16] P:1710.40 E:0.116830 |  I've got to say, when Bellingham did win the ball,
[9419.16 - 9422.16] P:1734.18 E:0.113147 |  I just wondered, Matt, where they could have played it inside to Foden.
[9422.16 - 9424.16] P:1748.98 E:0.110400 |  Quicker, whether there was that option,
[9424.16 - 9426.16] P:1825.38 E:0.118306 |  but Kane took a touch.
[9426.16 - 9429.16] P:1773.34 E:0.114800 |  What a block that is from Rodry to get out to him.
[9429.16 - 9432.16] P:1785.35 E:0.114336 |  There's a problem to Spain, because in clearing that,
[9432.16 - 9435.16] P:1758.31 E:0.118717 |  Rodry and Laporte collided,
[9435.16 - 9439.16] P:1740.89 E:0.117532 |  and Rodry looked to have really overstretched there.
[9439.16 - 9444.16] P:1706.72 E:0.109203 |  As he slid into Laporte, this former clubmate,
[9444.16 - 9446.16] P:1752.68 E:0.103102 |  and it could be a problem for Laporte.
[9446.16 - 9449.16] P:1732.80 E:0.112636 |  Yeah, Laporte doesn't look too comfortable on the floor,
[9449.16 - 9453.16] P:1791.88 E:0.109224 |  but I have to admire that covering tackle from Rodry.
[9453.16 - 9455.16] P:1736.91 E:0.113635 |  I mean, it did get slipped into Kane,
[9455.16 - 9458.16] P:1697.59 E:0.114633 |  and Rodry is the type of player that, you know, a lot of the work
[9458.16 - 9461.16] P:1790.09 E:0.107872 |  he gets through goes unnoticed, but it was a fantastic tackle,
[9461.16 - 9465.16] P:1471.86 E:0.119946 |  and then the follow-through, the ports just standing there,
[9465.16 - 9468.16] P:1589.45 E:0.129520 |  planted in the turf, and his knee goes into his ankle,
[9468.16 - 9471.16] P:1703.12 E:0.112831 |  whether or not he just jars his ankle or his knee,
[9471.16 - 9474.16] P:1760.98 E:0.106653 |  he's back upon his feet, but brilliant defensive play
[9474.16 - 9476.16] P:1724.71 E:0.115959 |  from the Spanish captain.
[9476.16 - 9479.16] P:1806.38 E:0.117850 |  The man with the deepest voice in Germany
[9479.16 - 9482.16] P:1779.94 E:0.116374 |  has just announced that there are two minutes about a time
[9482.16 - 9485.16] P:1781.92 E:0.123037 |  at really boomed around the stadium.
[9488.16 - 9490.16] P:1855.49 E:0.131807 |  Great kick to England on the right, then.
[9490.16 - 9493.16] P:1860.99 E:0.120714 |  Think Laporte OK, Rice holds up an arm,
[9493.16 - 9495.16] P:1915.82 E:0.114171 |  Rice plays it in towards the back post,
[9495.16 - 9498.16] P:1871.82 E:0.115669 |  it comes up a Spanish header, then the shot on the far side.
[9498.16 - 9502.16] P:1868.82 E:0.112020 |  From a stretching fold, and we're straight at Simon,
[9502.16 - 9504.16] P:1778.56 E:0.114976 |  who is able to gather it.
[9504.16 - 9507.16] P:1703.60 E:0.124260 |  Yeah, it's a really good ball, then.
[9507.16 - 9509.16] P:1800.78 E:0.128381 |  I think it comes off the Normandy,
[9509.16 - 9513.16] P:1730.05 E:0.120404 |  clicks a header on, and Bowden, yeah, he's just stretching.
[9515.16 - 9517.16] P:1556.15 E:0.128060 |  He gets a toe on the ball,
[9517.16 - 9520.16] P:1675.71 E:0.107268 |  it goes goalwards, but it's going to trouble
[9520.16 - 9522.16] P:1677.94 E:0.115825 |  nice and long at that pace.
[9522.16 - 9524.16] P:1825.27 E:0.122912 |  Laporte hits a long pass downfield,
[9524.16 - 9527.16] P:1761.27 E:0.118918 |  Pickford has come, I think the ball will roll away,
[9527.16 - 9531.16] P:1829.62 E:0.117429 |  because even though it's had Yamal and Walker chasing after it,
[9531.16 - 9534.16] P:1642.11 E:0.112675 |  it was out of play for a goal kick,
[9534.16 - 9537.16] P:1703.49 E:0.114482 |  Walker has fancied that once, against the 17-year-old.
[9537.16 - 9540.16] P:1718.44 E:0.120876 |  The 34-year-old against the 17-year-old?
[9540.16 - 9543.16] P:1764.25 E:0.112612 |  I just love the way that age, in that kind of difference,
[9543.16 - 9546.16] P:1679.71 E:0.117457 |  he still just cruises, and when he gets there,
[9546.16 - 9548.16] P:1696.24 E:0.106652 |  it's like a puff at the chase, as if to say,
[9548.16 - 9551.16] P:1695.70 E:0.113179 |  I weren't even trying, I was just cruising to that ball,
[9551.16 - 9553.16] P:1697.71 E:0.103118 |  I didn't even put the gas on.
[9553.16 - 9555.16] P:1609.52 E:0.115015 |  I mean, that is how good a first half he is.
[9555.16 - 9558.16] P:1695.93 E:0.112016 |  Chris is right, I mean, Walker has been spot-on
[9558.16 - 9560.16] P:1521.29 E:0.110833 |  in his first half so far.
[9560.16 - 9563.16] P:1655.35 E:0.114630 |  We talk about England having another chance here,
[9563.16 - 9566.16] P:1685.68 E:0.112976 |  the 34-year-old, this might be Walker's last chance.
[9566.16 - 9568.16] P:1531.27 E:0.119153 |  Whether he'd gone to the World Cup,
[9568.16 - 9572.16] P:1651.31 E:0.112683 |  he did think about retiring from international football after Qatar,
[9572.16 - 9575.16] P:1543.43 E:0.117344 |  but stayed on for this, and here he is in the final,
[9575.16 - 9578.16] P:1746.42 E:0.122160 |  Champions League winner, and there is the half-time whistle,
[9578.16 - 9581.16] P:1801.15 E:0.119255 |  the two minutes are up, Barrett Southgate walks away,
[9581.16 - 9585.16] P:1810.93 E:0.117204 |  and off they go, 0-0 at half-time.
[9585.16 - 9589.16] P:1599.95 E:0.122095 |  Spin, winning on points, but 0-0 the score.
[9589.16 - 9591.16] P:1679.27 E:0.120285 |  He really doesn't manage on...
[9591.16 - 9594.16] P:1649.91 E:0.112553 |  I actually think Barrett Southgate in England will go in a half-time.
[9594.16 - 9597.16] P:1737.96 E:0.107952 |  It's been pretty much job done, they've stifled Spain,
[9597.16 - 9601.16] P:1640.97 E:0.118440 |  they've stopped Spain from really getting any decent attempts
[9601.16 - 9603.16] P:1543.36 E:0.123679 |  on Jordan Pickford's goal.
[9603.16 - 9606.16] P:1546.83 E:0.119766 |  England haven't carried enough of a threat,
[9606.16 - 9608.16] P:1613.01 E:0.116720 |  but I think 0-0 at half-time.
[9608.16 - 9612.16] P:1452.12 E:0.122645 |  It's all to play for England, it's still there.
[9612.16 - 9616.16] P:1569.63 E:0.123026 |  I've written down two chances, Ruiz's shot that was blocked,
[9616.16 - 9619.16] P:1587.27 E:0.115819 |  and that folding effort right at the end of the half,
[9619.16 - 9621.16] P:1576.20 E:0.117484 |  was England's best-so-far-matt.
[9621.16 - 9624.16] P:1728.89 E:0.119283 |  Do I need to start thinking about you-know-what?
[9624.16 - 9626.16] P:1698.44 E:0.110228 |  Well, I wouldn't get the paper out yet, John,
[9626.16 - 9629.16] P:1622.65 E:0.114005 |  and start drawing charts for you-know-what.
[9629.16 - 9632.16] P:1553.63 E:0.110660 |  But it's a possibility, after that first 45,
[9632.16 - 9636.16] P:1602.92 E:0.104988 |  and England have set up very well, very defensively,
[9636.16 - 9640.16] P:1576.48 E:0.110948 |  I think to stop Spain, certainly in wide areas,
[9640.16 - 9644.16] P:1493.24 E:0.114821 |  and have done that very effectively, and have well in this game.
[9644.16 - 9648.16] P:1510.52 E:0.120876 |  So, half-time in this beautiful and cosmopolitan city,
[9648.16 - 9651.16] P:1553.59 E:0.115801 |  it is Spain, Nill, England, Nill,
[9651.16 - 9655.16] P:1660.53 E:0.108081 |  and on the subject of cosmopolitan, Mark Chapman.
[9656.16 - 9658.16] P:1607.00 E:0.130209 |  Oh, how very kind of you.
[9658.16 - 9661.16] P:1541.89 E:0.120051 |  You've been a drunkly old one, or I'm reading.
[9661.16 - 9663.16] P:1588.24 E:0.112617 |  Yeah, in the dentist.
[9665.16 - 9668.16] P:1697.87 E:0.118368 |  I don't know easy how much you were watching all the players that came off.
[9668.16 - 9671.16] P:1608.02 E:0.112663 |  Rotary just paused before everybody else.
[9671.16 - 9674.16] P:1753.69 E:0.117806 |  He looked at his knee, or his hamstring, or something,
[9674.16 - 9677.16] P:1591.03 E:0.114060 |  and then he put his hands through his hair.
[9677.16 - 9680.16] P:1796.37 E:0.121295 |  I mean, look, we've seen him look tired at various stages of the tournament.
[9680.16 - 9682.16] P:1753.57 E:0.114711 |  I'm sure he'll come back after the second half.
[9682.16 - 9685.16] P:1824.01 E:0.107332 |  But I just wonder if there is something there.
[9685.16 - 9687.16] P:1783.27 E:0.111285 |  Yeah, potentially.
[9687.16 - 9691.16] P:1786.50 E:0.110075 |  I think England have been the ones who have suffered a lot,
[9691.16 - 9694.16] P:1911.26 E:0.111898 |  but I think Spain will go in there, feeling a little bit...
[9694.16 - 9696.16] P:1882.64 E:0.096232 |  You know, they've been by far the better team.
[9696.16 - 9699.16] P:1848.60 E:0.102360 |  They've dominated the possession, they've had the better chances,
[9699.16 - 9701.16] P:1888.53 E:0.093096 |  albeit very few of them,
[9701.16 - 9704.16] P:1914.69 E:0.106746 |  but it's proven that England are so resilient,
[9704.16 - 9706.16] P:1984.95 E:0.099198 |  and the defence in particularly...
[9706.16 - 9709.16] P:1890.72 E:0.105410 |  You've seen some fantastic tackles from John Stones and Mark Gay,
[9709.16 - 9712.16] P:1809.79 E:0.109862 |  right in front of me, about 10 or 15 metres away,
[9712.16 - 9714.16] P:1644.85 E:0.101581 |  where they've made last-ditch tackles.
[9714.16 - 9718.16] P:1775.37 E:0.111645 |  And Spain have got to, you know, perhaps revert to what Plan B might look like,
[9718.16 - 9720.16] P:1770.74 E:0.100278 |  because like the guys I've set up there,
[9720.16 - 9722.16] P:1822.53 E:0.102858 |  the fullbacks, Cal Walker and Luke Shaw in particular,
[9722.16 - 9724.16] P:1742.43 E:0.095049 |  have covered their wing, is excellent.
[9724.16 - 9727.16] P:1745.66 E:0.114876 |  Yeah, far English fullbacks are their best-to-players, Mark.
[9727.16 - 9729.16] P:1917.13 E:0.105010 |  Yeah, I agree.
[9729.16 - 9731.16] P:1949.31 E:0.107060 |  I think Walker's had a brilliant half,
[9731.16 - 9734.16] P:1923.70 E:0.116559 |  both defensively and offensively, two or three times,
[9734.16 - 9736.16] P:1826.09 E:0.102112 |  or twice in particular.
[9736.16 - 9738.16] P:1869.68 E:0.110306 |  It's been like a steam train on the overlap,
[9738.16 - 9742.16] P:1841.13 E:0.106262 |  one to get the ball, and one as a decoy for Saka to come inside.
[9742.16 - 9747.16] P:1866.54 E:0.105556 |  But one-on-ones, we're limiting positions on the pitch
[9747.16 - 9750.16] P:1841.87 E:0.107628 |  to Yamal and Nico Williams,
[9750.16 - 9752.16] P:1887.78 E:0.113252 |  where they're going to cross the ball in areas
[9752.16 - 9755.16] P:1877.75 E:0.100348 |  which aren't as effective as what they could be.
[9755.16 - 9757.16] P:1901.62 E:0.110715 |  I think that that's the key.
[9757.16 - 9759.16] P:1888.33 E:0.107196 |  It's hard to stop a play, wants to come inside,
[9759.16 - 9761.16] P:1889.07 E:0.106513 |  shift it half a yard and whip it,
[9761.16 - 9763.16] P:1799.02 E:0.108368 |  but they're doing it from areas that aren't as effective,
[9763.16 - 9765.16] P:1861.59 E:0.110092 |  and we're defending those situations really well.
[9765.16 - 9768.16] P:1880.02 E:0.094033 |  Keir Balagay is with us.
[9768.16 - 9770.16] P:1951.65 E:0.098628 |  Is it?
[9770.16 - 9772.16] P:1812.95 E:0.093065 |  Who's going to be the bravest here?
[9772.16 - 9776.16] P:1843.82 E:0.100974 |  There is that, but I disagree with Issey.
[9776.16 - 9779.16] P:1792.38 E:0.092458 |  I think England are playing better than Spain.
[9779.16 - 9781.16] P:1965.44 E:0.099142 |  Yes, England have got less possession,
[9781.16 - 9784.16] P:1863.59 E:0.095348 |  but this is the game that South could imagine.
[9784.16 - 9787.16] P:1993.49 E:0.095483 |  This is closer to the game that South could imagine
[9787.16 - 9789.16] P:1869.58 E:0.102512 |  than the one that Luzo Lapuente imagined,
[9789.16 - 9792.16] P:1994.10 E:0.104978 |  because you come back at the back,
[9792.16 - 9794.16] P:1921.76 E:0.105373 |  there's no space between the lines.
[9794.16 - 9797.16] P:1997.00 E:0.093939 |  We play as always, trying to put that place between the lines,
[9797.16 - 9799.16] P:1955.16 E:0.105977 |  but they've got no space.
[9799.16 - 9802.16] P:1803.64 E:0.092377 |  All right, let's go wide, and the full-backs are beating us.
[9802.16 - 9804.16] P:1831.88 E:0.108970 |  You mentioned the mark, it's true.
[9804.16 - 9806.16] P:2028.46 E:0.111723 |  We're scared of losing the ball,
[9806.16 - 9809.16] P:1842.67 E:0.102025 |  so we are predictable and slow-building up.
[9809.16 - 9812.16] P:1891.76 E:0.102342 |  No many drive with the ball if it's not Laporte.
[9812.16 - 9815.16] P:1911.01 E:0.094162 |  We lack that pace,
[9815.16 - 9817.16] P:1852.79 E:0.106321 |  and every time you attack, it feels dangerous,
[9817.16 - 9821.16] P:1827.52 E:0.103864 |  even though you haven't really generated any kind of dangerous movement,
[9821.16 - 9823.16] P:1944.33 E:0.098766 |  and you're looking for the moment,
[9823.16 - 9825.16] P:1944.88 E:0.099723 |  and it almost happened in a corner.
[9825.16 - 9827.16] P:1879.43 E:0.098104 |  So it's what South could was thinking of.
[9827.16 - 9830.16] P:1926.60 E:0.108433 |  Spain gave, Spain have been the better side.
[9830.16 - 9832.16] P:1917.91 E:0.108536 |  Doing what?
[9832.16 - 9834.16] P:1786.25 E:0.116212 |  We didn't do what we came out to do.
[9834.16 - 9837.16] P:1884.10 E:0.106604 |  We didn't do anything we came out to do.
[9837.16 - 9840.16] P:1856.52 E:0.105829 |  Spain have actually been more composed on the ball than England.
[9840.16 - 9843.16] P:1873.85 E:0.091636 |  What have England done in an attacking sense?
[9843.16 - 9846.16] P:1847.51 E:0.098651 |  Take the point about the Spade wide players
[9846.16 - 9849.16] P:1784.32 E:0.104439 |  and the fact they haven't created lots of opportunities.
[9849.16 - 9852.16] P:1806.58 E:0.104640 |  I think that Gareth will go in extremely happy,
[9852.16 - 9855.16] P:1720.00 E:0.105907 |  but England haven't been a better side than Spain.
[9855.16 - 9858.16] P:1820.58 E:0.100525 |  But you don't need to attack.
[9858.16 - 9860.16] P:1884.49 E:0.099299 |  That's the thing, and you almost scored.
[9860.16 - 9862.16] P:1848.73 E:0.098893 |  That, by the way, you may be frustrating for fans,
[9862.16 - 9864.16] P:1834.36 E:0.083960 |  but that's what Southgate is doing.
[9864.16 - 9867.16] P:1852.26 E:0.108178 |  And that's what they've done throughout the tournament.
[9867.16 - 9871.16] P:1860.97 E:0.107829 |  It's about finding a way, and they've found a way so far.
[9871.16 - 9875.16] P:1907.22 E:0.091075 |  Gareth was talking about his not-believer in fairytales.
[9875.16 - 9877.16] P:1738.24 E:0.106800 |  That was yesterday, wasn't it?
[9877.16 - 9879.16] P:1888.85 E:0.114056 |  If England win this tournament,
[9879.16 - 9882.16] P:1968.56 E:0.109131 |  could they be described as the ugly duckling?
[9882.16 - 9885.16] P:1926.64 E:0.107763 |  Do you think Roger's got a problem?
[9885.16 - 9888.16] P:1986.32 E:0.107954 |  There's a Spain substitute here warming up.
[9888.16 - 9890.16] P:1902.64 E:0.099188 |  Definitely.
[9890.16 - 9892.16] P:1887.47 E:0.116698 |  If I know who it is.
[9892.16 - 9895.16] P:1916.35 E:0.104315 |  But certainly, he was touching the back of his leg,
[9895.16 - 9897.16] P:1932.40 E:0.107867 |  hamstring or ischios,
[9897.16 - 9899.16] P:1954.90 E:0.096844 |  and certainly it's a prong,
[9899.16 - 9903.16] P:2001.21 E:0.102881 |  because he walked in talking to one of the fishers of the team.
[9903.16 - 9906.16] P:1887.40 E:0.105223 |  It was in that challenge with Kane there, wasn't it?
[9906.16 - 9908.16] P:2005.93 E:0.108576 |  I think he really was at full stretch there.
[9908.16 - 9910.16] P:1967.33 E:0.105485 |  It was a brilliant block.
[9910.16 - 9912.16] P:1963.59 E:0.092368 |  He clad into the port,
[9912.16 - 9915.16] P:2073.92 E:0.109624 |  but he certainly just caught his ankle in the turf as well
[9915.16 - 9918.16] P:1978.91 E:0.109274 |  at the same time, or his knee, and just jarred something.
[9918.16 - 9921.16] P:1967.73 E:0.087567 |  So whether or not that is a problem.
[9921.16 - 9923.16] P:1824.40 E:0.113531 |  Looks like Michel Marino, maybe.
[9923.16 - 9925.16] P:1816.46 E:0.097646 |  Certainly one of the best.
[9926.16 - 9928.16] P:1922.51 E:0.111630 |  It's Zubemendi.
[9928.16 - 9930.16] P:1789.02 E:0.107600 |  Who is Mendi?
[9930.16 - 9932.16] P:1951.92 E:0.113156 |  That is where Roger plays.
[9932.16 - 9934.16] P:2023.61 E:0.106951 |  So that means Roger will go into the central defence.
[9934.16 - 9936.16] P:2069.01 E:0.094535 |  No, I think Roger is off.
[9936.16 - 9939.16] P:1923.54 E:0.122782 |  The way Roger was at the end of that first half,
[9939.16 - 9942.16] P:1879.53 E:0.114736 |  I agree. I think Roger is off for the break.
[9942.16 - 9944.16] P:2006.60 E:0.109655 |  Well, his record for club and country,
[9944.16 - 9948.16] P:1980.08 E:0.107714 |  Roger, he's lost two games in 91 matches.
[9948.16 - 9951.16] P:1960.79 E:0.106777 |  That is massive, if that's the case.
[9951.16 - 9954.16] P:1883.49 E:0.117792 |  Keep an eye on that during half-time goal,
[9954.16 - 9957.16] P:1900.80 E:0.110905 |  as then after the first 45 here in Berlin,
[9957.16 - 9960.16] P:1886.06 E:0.098758 |  between Spain and England,
[9960.16 - 9963.16] P:1731.12 E:0.113406 |  it is seven minutes to nine o'clock,
[9963.16 - 9965.16] P:1829.13 E:0.102073 |  and here's the latest BBC News.
[9965.16 - 9968.16] P:1490.57 E:0.123061 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[9968.16 - 9970.16] P:1637.29 E:0.100627 |  Listen on BBC Sound.
[9970.16 - 9972.16] P:1535.10 E:0.107126 |  And with the update, I'm Stuart Clarkson.
[9972.16 - 9974.16] P:1412.22 E:0.102825 |  Good evening, President Biden has promised a swift
[9974.16 - 9977.16] P:1762.65 E:0.088266 |  and thorough investigation into the assassination attempt
[9977.16 - 9979.16] P:1799.20 E:0.088266 |  against Donald Trump.
[9979.16 - 9981.16] P:1550.27 E:0.107078 |  While the president was injured during a campaign rally
[9981.16 - 9983.16] P:1774.44 E:0.094455 |  in Pennsylvania last night,
[9983.16 - 9985.16] P:1809.70 E:0.097311 |  Mr. Biden says he had a short and good conversation
[9985.16 - 9987.16] P:1088.20 E:0.074812 |  earlier with his rival for the presidency.
[9987.16 - 9989.16] P:1591.82 E:0.084127 |  Mr. Trump is a former president
[9989.16 - 9991.16] P:1335.58 E:0.075737 |  and nominee of the Republican Party,
[9991.16 - 9994.16] P:1788.15 E:0.068862 |  already receives a heightened level of security.
[9994.16 - 9996.16] P:1856.00 E:0.078082 |  And I've been consistent in my direction
[9996.16 - 9998.16] P:1730.56 E:0.077976 |  of the Secret Service to provide him with
[9998.16 - 10001.16] P:1940.91 E:0.086874 |  every resource, capability and protective measure
[10001.16 - 10003.16] P:1907.65 E:0.076319 |  necessary to ensure his continued safety.
[10003.16 - 10005.16] P:1769.31 E:0.091062 |  I've directed the head of the Secret Service
[10005.16 - 10008.16] P:1861.11 E:0.074629 |  to review all security measures
[10008.16 - 10010.16] P:1578.00 E:0.073273 |  for the Republican National Convention,
[10010.16 - 10013.16] P:1933.34 E:0.072190 |  which is scheduled to start tomorrow.
[10013.16 - 10016.16] P:1636.64 E:0.056797 |  And third, I've directed an independent review
[10016.16 - 10019.16] P:1674.80 E:0.084853 |  of the national security at yesterday's rally
[10019.16 - 10021.16] P:1817.06 E:0.072093 |  to assess exactly what happened,
[10021.16 - 10024.16] P:1783.43 E:0.064048 |  and we'll share the results of that independent review
[10024.16 - 10026.16] P:1207.93 E:0.068179 |  with the American people as well.
[10026.16 - 10029.16] P:1800.53 E:0.075654 |  And finally, we must unite as one nation
[10029.16 - 10031.16] P:1811.61 E:0.067709 |  to demonstrate who we are.

[10086.16 - 10088.16] P:1782.46 E:0.108316 |  like that of Liam and Noel Gallagher.

[10156.16 - 10160.16] P:1690.06 E:0.111906 |  And beats Novak Djokovic once again.
[10160.16 - 10164.16] P:1689.96 E:0.109989 |  This time in 2027 minutes.
[10164.16 - 10169.16] P:1703.57 E:0.114345 |  Only half the time it took him to win in five sets on Centre Court last year.
[10169.16 - 10173.16] P:1552.38 E:0.084818 |  It was a little bit different from last year.
[10173.16 - 10176.16] P:1460.17 E:0.066666 |  Obviously I'm not new anymore.
[10176.16 - 10179.16] P:1500.20 E:0.094106 |  I knew what I have to do before the match,
[10179.16 - 10185.16] P:1862.23 E:0.085178 |  what I have to do to deal better with the nerves, with the situations.
[10185.16 - 10188.16] P:1819.38 E:0.077956 |  I think I did it pretty well.
[10188.16 - 10191.16] P:1496.03 E:0.095613 |  The day before it was really calm for me.
[10191.16 - 10193.16] P:1548.40 E:0.090006 |  I played some golf.
[10193.16 - 10196.16] P:1712.64 E:0.056822 |  I didn't think about the match.
[10196.16 - 10198.16] P:1581.71 E:0.096763 |  So it was a really helpful day for me.
[10198.16 - 10203.16] P:1593.80 E:0.078091 |  And today, just one hour before the match,
[10203.16 - 10206.16] P:1831.65 E:0.076724 |  I started to feel the nerves and to feel the situation.
[10206.16 - 10209.16] P:1759.89 E:0.077700 |  Before that, it was a really calm day for me.
[10209.16 - 10212.16] P:1768.88 E:0.086144 |  So it was a really different situation for me.
[10212.16 - 10215.16] P:1955.21 E:0.072493 |  I did it so much better than last year.
[10215.16 - 10217.16] P:1615.88 E:0.069123 |  So I'm really proud about it.
[10217.16 - 10221.16] P:1112.09 E:0.074198 |  You were absolutely spot on with your tennis in terms of the standard you were playing to.
[10221.16 - 10223.16] P:1476.59 E:0.057736 |  You come to serve for it.
[10223.16 - 10224.16] P:1170.55 E:0.101009 |  You're 40 love up.
[10224.16 - 10227.16] P:1166.74 E:0.060615 |  And suddenly there's just a tiny weenie wobble.
[10227.16 - 10229.16] P:1435.07 E:0.059538 |  You got things back on track.
[10229.16 - 10232.16] P:1277.88 E:0.073492 |  You get championship points again in the tiebreak and talk us through it.
[10232.16 - 10233.16] P:1782.93 E:0.045199 |  What's happening in your head?
[10233.16 - 10238.16] P:1588.50 E:0.083417 |  Well, yeah, 40 love serving after playing great points.
[10238.16 - 10241.16] P:1669.95 E:0.046915 |  I knew that the Novak is...
[10241.16 - 10243.16] P:1538.86 E:0.058823 |  It was not going to give up.
[10243.16 - 10244.16] P:1722.77 E:0.054253 |  I played great points.
[10244.16 - 10246.16] P:1841.92 E:0.079032 |  I had to stay there.
[10246.16 - 10248.16] P:1880.92 E:0.077445 |  I knew that I had to stay there.
[10248.16 - 10250.16] P:1763.94 E:0.091352 |  It was just a game.
[10250.16 - 10253.16] P:1706.94 E:0.072648 |  You know, after that break, five-four.
[10253.16 - 10258.16] P:1558.42 E:0.066100 |  So it wasn't meant that I was going to lose that set.
[10258.16 - 10262.16] P:1838.78 E:0.077612 |  So I had to stay there to still play in the way that I was playing.
[10262.16 - 10266.16] P:1635.04 E:0.089120 |  I played great few games and then in the tiebreak I did everything that I had.
[10266.16 - 10272.16] P:1573.97 E:0.083223 |  Playing great shots, great points and then being with so much ball up again.
[10272.16 - 10280.16] P:1749.52 E:0.087566 |  So I tried to make it a little bit different or play a big serve that I did.
[10280.16 - 10285.16] P:1653.93 E:0.060832 |  Hopefully, yeah, I say thanks God that I got the win at the end.
[10285.16 - 10288.16] P:1815.49 E:0.108770 |  Carlos Alcarrath with Clare Balding.
[10288.16 - 10295.16] P:1609.71 E:0.102584 |  And then, he went on to defend his double title with Gordon Reed.
[10295.16 - 10300.16] P:1656.66 E:0.110330 |  Bob McIntyre won the Scottish Open after birding the final hole at the Renaissance Club.
[10300.16 - 10304.16] P:1684.02 E:0.109436 |  Adam Scott finished one shot behind in second.
[10304.16 - 10307.16] P:1498.85 E:0.107314 |  After his win, Bob McIntyre said, it's incredible.
[10307.16 - 10313.16] P:1621.79 E:0.111716 |  Next week is a new week, but I tell you, I'm going to celebrate this with my family, friends and everyone here.
[10313.16 - 10315.16] P:1567.25 E:0.107604 |  I'm going to celebrate this one hard.
[10316.16 - 10320.16] P:1628.97 E:0.103776 |  We'll pitch up to the open when we pitch up to the open.
[10320.16 - 10327.16] P:1686.60 E:0.110650 |  Our coverage of the 152nd Open Championship begins with a preview show on Wednesday night
[10327.16 - 10333.16] P:1538.42 E:0.103686 |  and then from 10am on 5 live on Thursday morning.
[10333.16 - 10340.16] P:1579.35 E:0.108191 |  Just watching the Spanish technical area here and there is absolutely no doubt, Guillem.
[10340.16 - 10344.16] P:1686.59 E:0.108107 |  The Zubramendi is coming on. He spent most of half-time warming up.
[10344.16 - 10351.16] P:1738.53 E:0.104110 |  He's just done the final thing to indicate he's coming on, which is to take off that sort of lemon warm-up shirt
[10351.16 - 10357.16] P:1661.64 E:0.108958 |  that the Spanish wear and change into his number 18 red kit and he is on.
[10357.16 - 10363.16] P:1734.33 E:0.104602 |  Yeah, he hasn't got the personality of Rodri, but he's a player that many big teams won
[10363.16 - 10367.16] P:1690.76 E:0.108745 |  because he's very good in his positional football.
[10367.16 - 10372.16] P:1736.01 E:0.104188 |  He will make his passing simple, but he doesn't drive the whole team.
[10372.16 - 10376.16] P:1714.91 E:0.111143 |  So he's going to need help from Pani Olmore, from Fabian.
[10377.16 - 10381.16] P:1643.77 E:0.112318 |  Is he? That has to change things for England as they come out here
[10381.16 - 10385.16] P:1574.47 E:0.104254 |  and realise that the Spanish are going to have to make a change.
[10388.16 - 10392.16] P:1535.32 E:0.111538 |  No, is he, isn't there? OK, Matt, do you want to answer that as you're next to me?
[10392.16 - 10398.16] P:1562.15 E:0.105359 |  Yeah, I mean, it's a massive boost, isn't it? You're taking off a player who is a secret weapon
[10398.16 - 10402.16] P:1652.28 E:0.105317 |  in the sense he doesn't lose football matches. You know, they're the facts around Rodri.
[10402.16 - 10406.16] P:1646.71 E:0.104790 |  Whether or not he's effective in this particular game, but that is him as a player.
[10406.16 - 10410.16] P:1664.35 E:0.112456 |  And he has been. I mean, he's orchestrating it, the challenge that he made.
[10410.16 - 10414.16] P:1586.12 E:0.105950 |  He gets through all the ground, so it's a massive, massive loss for Spain.
[10414.16 - 10420.16] P:1693.97 E:0.106255 |  And what a boost for England in a game that is playing out actually near perfect
[10420.16 - 10423.16] P:1661.89 E:0.101821 |  to probably what Garry Southgate did picture it.
[10423.16 - 10428.16] P:1797.06 E:0.109623 |  Emeric Laporte has come out with his arm around Carl Walker.
[10428.16 - 10431.16] P:1729.89 E:0.111512 |  And to get back out onto the pitch here at the Olympic Stadium,
[10431.16 - 10438.16] P:1611.39 E:0.106187 |  there are some stairs down to then come up, to then go and get some stairs up to come out.
[10438.16 - 10442.16] P:1649.02 E:0.111540 |  But next to the staircase, there's also an escalator.
[10442.16 - 10447.16] P:1621.56 E:0.109758 |  So Carl Walker and Emeric Laporte got the escalator together,
[10447.16 - 10452.16] P:1649.60 E:0.112772 |  which given the amount of running Crystal to Carl Walker's had to do at the speeds he's had to go out.
[10452.16 - 10457.16] P:1606.03 E:0.110207 |  I think I'd take the escalator rather than the stairs to get myself ready for the second half.
[10457.16 - 10463.16] P:1593.14 E:0.108689 |  Yeah, absolutely. Good decision from Carl Walker. He's made good decisions all evening so far.
[10463.16 - 10468.16] P:1618.26 E:0.113082 |  I've got to say that the way he has nullified Nico Williams, who has been sensational in this tournament,
[10468.16 - 10474.16] P:1620.09 E:0.110674 |  I'm not saying it surprised me, but that was certainly a key battle going into this game.
[10474.16 - 10478.16] P:1762.22 E:0.112807 |  Nico Williams, after that, he drove at him in the first couple of minutes.
[10478.16 - 10483.16] P:1850.15 E:0.119575 |  Carl Walker got the better of him, but since then he's become a little bit hesitant.
[10483.16 - 10485.16] P:1806.29 E:0.116491 |  He looks like he doesn't believe he can go past him.
[10485.16 - 10489.16] P:1901.16 E:0.113972 |  Carl Walker best player in the first half all over the pitch.
[10489.16 - 10493.16] P:1865.33 E:0.116484 |  Just needs to replicate that form in the second half.
[10493.16 - 10496.16] P:1787.11 E:0.109385 |  What a boost for England. Whatever anybody says.
[10496.16 - 10500.16] P:1943.48 E:0.111457 |  Spain losing Rodgery. He is the heartbeat of their team.
[10500.16 - 10503.16] P:1852.03 E:0.105056 |  I mean, that's a massive shot in the arm for England.
[10503.16 - 10508.16] P:1794.21 E:0.107575 |  And if England can shift it quicker, Crossfield, that's where they seem to be able to carry the most threat,
[10508.16 - 10509.16] P:1809.15 E:0.100888 |  but it's got to be quickly.
[10509.16 - 10514.16] P:1838.03 E:0.103881 |  Quickly, Aura's that one direct ball. Luke Shaw did it once with his left foot,
[10514.16 - 10518.16] P:1851.01 E:0.101933 |  pinged it straight out to Saka. Then there isn't the support for Kukere,
[10518.16 - 10521.16] P:1892.62 E:0.106376 |  and he can just maybe build up ahead of steam with Walker on the overlap.
[10521.16 - 10526.16] P:1970.25 E:0.100979 |  He just seems to be like a train going forwards, and if they can create those scenarios.
[10526.16 - 10530.16] P:1907.41 E:0.099870 |  But I just think it's going to be a grindy performance.
[10530.16 - 10532.16] P:1882.47 E:0.110132 |  It has been so far. It's been very gritty.
[10532.16 - 10535.16] P:1925.62 E:0.099230 |  The back four have played exceptional stones in Gehie,
[10535.16 - 10539.16] P:1943.00 E:0.108829 |  as well as the full backs, really good tactically and with their movement,
[10539.16 - 10543.16] P:1933.87 E:0.104492 |  the discipline, positioning, and I was playing out well so far for England,
[10543.16 - 10545.16] P:1854.43 E:0.108205 |  even though they're just not having much of the ball.
[10545.16 - 10547.16] P:1991.51 E:0.099628 |  Very quickly, you all right, Gim?
[10547.16 - 10549.16] P:1959.62 E:0.103512 |  We have to beat the full backs.
[10549.16 - 10552.16] P:1885.27 E:0.115450 |  There will be occasions in which it will be 1v1.
[10552.16 - 10555.16] P:1764.36 E:0.100417 |  If Nico and Lamin can beat them, that's our chance.
[10555.16 - 10557.16] P:1878.57 E:0.096677 |  Otherwise, it's going English way.
[10557.16 - 10559.16] P:1847.40 E:0.108993 |  Big boost for England, then.
[10559.16 - 10562.16] P:1821.42 E:0.093343 |  Rodry is off in Dennis.
[10562.16 - 10564.16] P:1842.39 E:0.110409 |  And just to reiterate, this is...
[10564.16 - 10567.16] P:1826.26 E:0.106265 |  He's almost irreplaceable for club and country.
[10567.16 - 10569.16] P:1734.31 E:0.118894 |  There was 2 defeats in 91.
[10569.16 - 10571.16] P:1501.29 E:0.130044 |  That was the Scott-McTomonet effect, by the way.
[10571.16 - 10574.16] P:1586.09 E:0.129442 |  It was Scotland and Manchester United who inflicted those 2 defeats.
[10574.16 - 10579.16] P:1696.66 E:0.123591 |  But Martin Zubermendi is coming on for just his 10th appearance for Spain.
[10579.16 - 10581.16] P:1657.84 E:0.123731 |  He's a 25-year-old bit-fielder,
[10581.16 - 10584.16] P:1788.30 E:0.116505 |  plays for Real Sociedad who finished 6th in La Liga.
[10584.16 - 10587.16] P:1721.34 E:0.127339 |  He's got a £51 million release clause, incidentally,
[10587.16 - 10590.16] P:1770.63 E:0.110945 |  and he's been heavily linked with Arsenal.
[10590.16 - 10593.16] P:1810.12 E:0.106803 |  As Spain get us back underway,
[10593.16 - 10597.16] P:1756.09 E:0.104827 |  and we're still deadlocked at 0-0 here in Berlin,
[10597.16 - 10599.16] P:1805.14 E:0.105483 |  as Spain in their red shirts,
[10599.16 - 10602.16] P:1741.04 E:0.112342 |  navy blue shorts are playing from left to right,
[10602.16 - 10606.16] P:1732.02 E:0.117760 |  as we look against England all in white,
[10606.16 - 10609.16] P:1587.19 E:0.112999 |  as the English fans sing the national anthem
[10609.16 - 10612.16] P:1580.17 E:0.119904 |  for a side that has Jordan Pickford in goal.
[10612.16 - 10616.16] P:1615.81 E:0.112258 |  Back three of Walker, Stones and Gay-Heat.
[10616.16 - 10620.16] P:1696.16 E:0.120644 |  Saka and Shaw, his first start of the tournament,
[10620.16 - 10624.16] P:1772.21 E:0.108655 |  as the wing-backs Rice, Maynard Bellingham, Coden,
[10624.16 - 10626.16] P:1836.75 E:0.111151 |  and the captain, Harry Kane.
[10626.16 - 10628.16] P:1696.94 E:0.119070 |  Spain now line up with Simon,
[10628.16 - 10632.16] P:1579.37 E:0.121224 |  back four of Carvajal, Le Normand, Le Porte and Cucaraya,
[10632.16 - 10636.16] P:1670.63 E:0.102404 |  almost Zubermendi, and Fabian, Fabian Ruiz,
[10636.16 - 10638.16] P:1642.87 E:0.109674 |  Yamal, Williams and Marata.
[10638.16 - 10642.16] P:1672.26 E:0.107352 |  Cucaraya on that far side, up against Williams, close.
[10642.16 - 10646.16] P:1719.81 E:0.107778 |  To him though was Carl Walker, they have to pass the ball back to Le Porte.
[10646.16 - 10648.16] P:1759.10 E:0.110562 |  He's no stranger to carry the ball forward.
[10648.16 - 10653.16] P:1722.84 E:0.110222 |  Fabian forward to Carvajal, first-time ball to La Mignamal.
[10653.16 - 10655.16] P:1900.22 E:0.107367 |  He's going to cut inside, it's on to his left foot,
[10655.16 - 10658.16] P:1896.38 E:0.117271 |  he passes the ball, Williams arriving on mark,
[10658.16 - 10663.16] P:2013.02 E:0.110335 |  and Williams scores, just over 60 seconds into the second half.
[10663.16 - 10667.16] P:1828.89 E:0.110693 |  And Williams had all the time in the world to fire past Jordan Pickford.
[10668.16 - 10672.16] P:1688.98 E:0.121066 |  And it means that in every knockout stage of this Euro tournament,
[10672.16 - 10675.16] P:1669.57 E:0.119241 |  England concede first, but here in the final,
[10675.16 - 10677.16] P:1794.87 E:0.116935 |  it's Spain who lead 1-0.
[10677.16 - 10681.16] P:1772.04 E:0.110089 |  Well, that is the sucker punch that Guillaume's talking about.
[10681.16 - 10686.16] P:1734.01 E:0.107748 |  That's what he asked for, a half-time, and it gets delivered.
[10686.16 - 10690.16] P:1705.93 E:0.117200 |  What a ball from Carvajal, that's the pass that creates this face.
[10690.16 - 10693.16] P:1618.73 E:0.117899 |  It's a flip, with the outside of the boot,
[10693.16 - 10697.16] P:1728.38 E:0.117422 |  it's near the halfway line, and he spins it inside Luke Shaw,
[10697.16 - 10701.16] P:1719.50 E:0.113134 |  who's on the outside, your mouth comes inside,
[10701.16 - 10705.16] P:1632.71 E:0.118018 |  steps into the pitch, rolls it to his teammate and good friend,
[10705.16 - 10709.16] P:1657.62 E:0.117927 |  Nico Williams on his left foot, and it's a super-composed finish.
[10709.16 - 10713.16] P:1666.06 E:0.118600 |  Side foot, slotted into the far corner,
[10713.16 - 10716.16] P:1838.26 E:0.104567 |  Walker's desperate to get across, but he can't get the block in.
[10716.16 - 10719.16] P:1848.48 E:0.107625 |  Pickford stays on his feet, tries to make himself big,
[10719.16 - 10722.16] P:1840.01 E:0.105610 |  but such is the quality of the finish.
[10722.16 - 10725.16] P:1740.69 E:0.119128 |  It's a superly worked goal from Spain,
[10725.16 - 10728.16] P:1800.12 E:0.111726 |  with both the wide players contributing massively.
[10728.16 - 10731.16] P:1706.10 E:0.113291 |  Let's go pick side, is it Christensen?
[10731.16 - 10735.16] P:1726.23 E:0.111037 |  Well, I had a good view from behind the goal.
[10735.16 - 10738.16] P:1668.97 E:0.113831 |  What a finish that is, you've got to admit, that's wonderful play.
[10738.16 - 10741.16] P:1595.07 E:0.109444 |  We said it half-time about the wingers being nullified
[10741.16 - 10744.16] P:1600.37 E:0.107239 |  by our full-backs Walker and Shaw, but my word, they cut us open then.
[10744.16 - 10748.16] P:1724.20 E:0.098114 |  England had done this before, they can do it again, they can get back into it.
[10748.16 - 10749.16] P:1490.10 E:0.131639 |  Chris?
[10749.16 - 10753.16] P:1609.27 E:0.121342 |  The end England, I mean, they've been resilient in this competition,
[10753.16 - 10756.16] P:1743.55 E:0.113335 |  so far they're going to have to dig deeper this evening.
[10756.16 - 10761.16] P:1699.91 E:0.111083 |  There I was talking about Spain losing the heartbeat of the team.
[10761.16 - 10764.16] P:1729.50 E:0.109763 |  I mean, it's a brilliant move, and that's right,
[10764.16 - 10767.16] P:1727.74 E:0.109026 |  the pass from Carval, pass of the evening outside of the right foot,
[10767.16 - 10769.16] P:1673.92 E:0.102751 |  playing around with the owners,
[10769.16 - 10773.16] P:1706.04 E:0.117719 |  and then your maul with the composure,
[10773.16 - 10776.16] P:1680.81 E:0.123635 |  defined as opposite winger Williams, who still had a fair bit to do.
[10776.16 - 10779.16] P:1698.14 E:0.110994 |  Brilliant compose finish from him, though.
[10779.16 - 10782.16] P:1813.02 E:0.115981 |  Ball up towards Merata, Carval, howl, clips it in field,
[10782.16 - 10786.16] P:1784.55 E:0.117335 |  Williams again arriving outside the area, and Mark passes the ball to Olmo,
[10786.16 - 10788.16] P:1931.52 E:0.116693 |  creates the space with his first touch,
[10788.16 - 10791.16] P:1854.38 E:0.107077 |  and then left foot, it drags it wide off target.
[10791.16 - 10794.16] P:1794.51 E:0.109754 |  That could so easily have been a second goal for Spain.
[10794.16 - 10797.16] P:1625.03 E:0.113035 |  Yeah, and England have got to compose themselves.
[10797.16 - 10800.16] P:1719.12 E:0.122959 |  Maybe slightly fortunate Carval with the ball to Olmo initially,
[10800.16 - 10804.16] P:1733.71 E:0.111764 |  flicks the header out to Williams, makes it forward,
[10804.16 - 10808.16] P:1708.12 E:0.111815 |  Ronu then, Williams finds him, takes a brilliant first touch,
[10808.16 - 10811.16] P:1688.68 E:0.115987 |  it's got to hit the target left foot, and he pulls a shot
[10811.16 - 10814.16] P:1659.88 E:0.107784 |  by the Pickfords, left hand post.
[10814.16 - 10819.16] P:1682.97 E:0.114654 |  Well, England, as Izzy said, went behind to Slovakia in the last 16,
[10819.16 - 10823.16] P:1667.78 E:0.109304 |  and of course they did exactly the same in the quarters and the semi.
[10823.16 - 10826.16] P:1748.43 E:0.117725 |  Indeed, they're the first side to actually reach a final by going behind
[10826.16 - 10829.16] P:1695.94 E:0.116219 |  in the last eight and the last four.
[10829.16 - 10832.16] P:1647.63 E:0.107802 |  And in the build-up to this game,
[10832.16 - 10836.16] P:1656.82 E:0.116652 |  Garas Southgate yesterday was talking about the long-term vision.
[10836.16 - 10841.16] P:1661.27 E:0.119845 |  They've used the analogy of the 1966 World Cup final, where England,
[10841.16 - 10845.16] P:1721.23 E:0.114390 |  for those of a certain age, will recall that they went behind.
[10845.16 - 10848.16] P:1657.29 E:0.115158 |  Oh, as Bellingham dived in, Carvajal got away from that challenge,
[10848.16 - 10852.16] P:1561.72 E:0.113525 |  made it on the halfway line, wins it back, Bellingham on the left,
[10852.16 - 10854.16] P:1503.93 E:0.120441 |  and there was Carvajal.
[10854.16 - 10856.16] P:1696.34 E:0.128614 |  The ominous statistic is this, though,
[10856.16 - 10859.16] P:1708.64 E:0.119580 |  that Spain have never lost a European championship knockout game
[10859.16 - 10861.16] P:1728.67 E:0.114944 |  when they've scored first.
[10861.16 - 10865.16] P:1634.96 E:0.118626 |  Yeah, Duke Bellingham has to be careful, he keeps his composure.
[10865.16 - 10868.16] P:1799.26 E:0.117608 |  So when he gets frustrated, certainly being the go-behind,
[10868.16 - 10872.16] P:1633.04 E:0.112032 |  he can just tend to maybe be a little bit rash, and that tackle there,
[10872.16 - 10875.16] P:1673.63 E:0.113624 |  it was fortunate for him to make contact, they've been in big trouble.
[10875.16 - 10878.16] P:1666.35 E:0.123948 |  Bellingham collects the ball and runs sure on the overlap.
[10878.16 - 10881.16] P:1785.27 E:0.112984 |  Carvajal tries to squeeze it out and succeeds.
[10881.16 - 10885.16] P:1820.39 E:0.115938 |  I think for the first time tonight, we're able to hear Spanish voices
[10885.16 - 10887.16] P:1759.78 E:0.110334 |  inside the Olympic Stadium here in Berlin.
[10887.16 - 10891.16] P:1765.56 E:0.111211 |  Gold kick to Spain, five-lie, the World Service, BBC sounds,
[10891.16 - 10893.16] P:1593.57 E:0.115397 |  and it's Spain who are leading 1-0.
[10893.16 - 10897.16] P:1652.81 E:0.116997 |  It's not amazing how a goal changes the game,
[10897.16 - 10902.16] P:1679.46 E:0.118372 |  and we actually saw England brave enough to play through the Spanish midfield there.
[10902.16 - 10905.16] P:1637.78 E:0.113781 |  I've got to say, the pass from Bellingham was so, so sloppy,
[10905.16 - 10910.16] P:1681.51 E:0.121045 |  England in a good position, hyped the pitch, easy pass to Luke Shaw, missed.
[10910.16 - 10915.16] P:1641.60 E:0.113143 |  Headed away by Gehir, hooked forward, kept in play by Shaw.
[10915.16 - 10918.16] P:1713.78 E:0.113402 |  Time just to slow it down on the halfway line,
[10918.16 - 10920.16] P:1645.54 E:0.114250 |  as England all in white, play from right to left,
[10920.16 - 10923.16] P:1736.63 E:0.111167 |  Maynou looks to get away from Olmo, passes it behind him.
[10925.16 - 10929.16] P:1834.61 E:0.116040 |  Towards Declan Rice, now towards Walker,
[10929.16 - 10932.16] P:1733.19 E:0.110494 |  six yards short of the halfway line, pings it forward towards Saka,
[10932.16 - 10936.16] P:1838.10 E:0.106737 |  takes it in his stride, Cook-Harre matches it, step by step,
[10936.16 - 10941.16] P:1765.69 E:0.105743 |  still snapping away at the heels, infield, Foden, 30 yards out from goal.
[10941.16 - 10946.16] P:1786.93 E:0.113637 |  Rice, now across towards Shaw, Bellingham is on this near side of the left,
[10946.16 - 10949.16] P:1790.82 E:0.114789 |  he's going to run back infield, every red shirt back behind the ball.
[10950.16 - 10956.16] P:1874.24 E:0.112032 |  As Rice, towards Stones, out towards Saka level, the penalty area,
[10956.16 - 10961.16] P:1754.23 E:0.110510 |  infield to Maynou, Maynou, back with Rice, Spain though working hard,
[10961.16 - 10964.16] P:1792.62 E:0.109246 |  keeping their shape, popped up a little bit to Bellingham,
[10964.16 - 10968.16] P:1879.98 E:0.112605 |  rolls it out towards Walker, Walker right hand side, it's a deep cross,
[10968.16 - 10973.16] P:1703.65 E:0.115028 |  very deep in fact, and Shaw will not keep the ball in play.
[10973.16 - 10976.16] P:1808.02 E:0.121032 |  It's better possession, moving the ball a lot nicer there, England,
[10976.16 - 10979.16] P:1737.45 E:0.117812 |  getting hold of the ball even, we haven't had much of it
[10979.16 - 10984.16] P:1729.97 E:0.114294 |  in this game so far, and the game plan all sat on keeping a clean sheet,
[10984.16 - 10991.16] P:1732.71 E:0.117725 |  keeping Spain out, now we've gone behind, it's going to have to be a significant switch,
[10991.16 - 10994.16] P:1784.27 E:0.118793 |  you feel, they're going to have to come out of the shell a little bit, England,
[10994.16 - 10997.16] P:1705.50 E:0.117512 |  try and get hold of the ball, and like Chris said, play through the lines
[10997.16 - 10999.16] P:1508.08 E:0.105962 |  and be a little bit more adventurous.
[10999.16 - 11002.16] P:1714.97 E:0.120325 |  They're going to have to show the levels of resilience that they showed
[11002.16 - 11007.16] P:1792.52 E:0.118641 |  in the previous knockout matches, that certainly Spain have started
[11007.16 - 11012.16] P:1709.19 E:0.103904 |  with a swagger to this second half, as Williams picks it up,
[11012.16 - 11019.16] P:1644.59 E:0.116807 |  back it goes to Kukareya, Le Porte, and now with his central defensive partner,
[11019.16 - 11024.16] P:1572.43 E:0.120467 |  Le Norman, Le Norman midway through the Spain half,
[11024.16 - 11027.16] P:1647.47 E:0.119623 |  Bowdoin runs towards him, along the ground to Carvajal,
[11027.16 - 11030.16] P:1649.05 E:0.115361 |  Bellingham will try and put Carvajal under pressure,
[11030.16 - 11033.16] P:1673.94 E:0.119578 |  Kane now runs towards the goalkeeper, Unai Simon,
[11033.16 - 11037.16] P:1688.96 E:0.121412 |  hits the ball low, reaches Marata, holds it up, lays it off,
[11037.16 - 11041.16] P:1875.43 E:0.113777 |  Zubemendi now coming forward, shrugs off the challenge of Stones,
[11041.16 - 11045.16] P:1894.84 E:0.111202 |  and Stones impeded him, he's going to get a yellow card, seems harsh.
[11045.16 - 11050.16] P:1817.24 E:0.108568 |  Seems very harsh, I mean he's shaking his head, I mean he had the momentum there,
[11050.16 - 11055.16] P:1664.26 E:0.106860 |  Zubemendi, lovely play from Marata, super centre forward play hold up,
[11055.16 - 11060.16] P:1743.96 E:0.110234 |  slots in the midfield play running past him, and Stones, he does have some contact
[11060.16 - 11063.16] P:1760.04 E:0.112738 |  but I think Zubemendi goes down really easily,
[11063.16 - 11065.16] P:1854.79 E:0.116258 |  but the referee's always going to give a yellow card there
[11065.16 - 11068.16] P:1640.00 E:0.109470 |  because he's stopping him from making progress in behind.
[11068.16 - 11075.16] P:1740.82 E:0.116058 |  Third yellow card of the evening, Kukareya squealed as he went to ground
[11075.16 - 11080.16] P:1619.27 E:0.115031 |  under the challenge of Saka, Spain keeping the ball, Fabian,
[11080.16 - 11085.16] P:1653.92 E:0.119557 |  such a versatile midfielder, he can go forward, he can also just drop deep as well,
[11085.16 - 11088.16] P:1497.00 E:0.119507 |  and here he is now in between the two central defenders,
[11088.16 - 11092.16] P:1589.25 E:0.113430 |  the defenders have split quite wide, full backs of Pushdan, Kukareya,
[11092.16 - 11097.16] P:1674.22 E:0.108040 |  out towards Williams, there's a real skip in his step isn't there,
[11097.16 - 11101.16] P:1657.33 E:0.112795 |  Vanico Williams with the opening goal, his second of the tournament
[11101.16 - 11106.16] P:1530.55 E:0.115534 |  after that fine goal that he scored against Georgia in the last 16,
[11106.16 - 11112.16] P:1630.98 E:0.112343 |  Spain with Zubemendi, Marata took Gehi with him as he dropped very, very deep.
[11113.16 - 11119.16] P:1688.12 E:0.116074 |  Now it is with La Porte, Fabian will pass the ball back.
[11119.16 - 11123.16] P:1616.45 E:0.124598 |  They're set up with the ball, Spain, the way they make the pitch big,
[11123.16 - 11129.16] P:1668.96 E:0.121136 |  and when England have it, the midfield, they just seem to just suck space out of the equation,
[11129.16 - 11134.16] P:1752.84 E:0.119403 |  nobody can have any time to have the ball, and they're really getting to their flow now.
[11134.16 - 11138.16] P:1648.39 E:0.117526 |  Glentier vocal backing though from the legions of England supporters
[11138.16 - 11140.16] P:1832.47 E:0.118010 |  who are here inside the Olympic Stadium,
[11140.16 - 11143.16] P:1822.93 E:0.117764 |  that Marata picks it up, drives at the heart of England defence,
[11143.16 - 11147.16] P:1831.22 E:0.113543 |  Gehi got a good block in there, and he's really pumped up,
[11147.16 - 11151.16] P:1819.76 E:0.114272 |  he knows that that was an important challenge, and he's trying to fire up his teammates too.
[11151.16 - 11156.16] P:1596.81 E:0.114978 |  Yeah, I mean it's a brilliant block from Gehi, I think Marata would have been better served
[11156.16 - 11160.16] P:1566.26 E:0.116769 |  to pop the ball out to Williams on the left-hand side, he was off balance when he got the shot off,
[11160.16 - 11166.16] P:1651.96 E:0.113229 |  but you're right Gehi fired up, needs to keep his composure though.
[11167.16 - 11172.16] P:1678.21 E:0.114355 |  This is Supermendi, left of the centre-circle, out towards that far side of Pavia,
[11172.16 - 11177.16] P:1682.94 E:0.114953 |  in field now to Olmo, lays it back towards the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder,
[11177.16 - 11182.16] P:1619.97 E:0.119286 |  Léonard Mann as it bounces onto his chest, gets it out from underneath his feet, forward ball,
[11182.16 - 11187.16] P:1841.52 E:0.118224 |  La Mignumal looks for that forward ball, Marata's got goal side, it's going goalwards,
[11187.16 - 11192.16] P:1885.71 E:0.109726 |  and it was cleared away inside the six-shot box by Stokes, Carvajal keeps it alive,
[11192.16 - 11197.16] P:1891.34 E:0.109903 |  back towards La Mignumal, onto his left foot, and then dispossessed by Bellingham,
[11197.16 - 11201.16] P:1761.84 E:0.117332 |  and Bellingham then drops his shoulder and runs away from the 17-year-old,
[11201.16 - 11205.16] P:1760.50 E:0.111766 |  but Bellingham then runs in towards Carvajal, flicks it back, Spain trying to put England
[11205.16 - 11209.16] P:1750.56 E:0.115795 |  and the pressure, rice with the clearance, only as far as Pavia, forward ball,
[11209.16 - 11215.16] P:1882.82 E:0.112190 |  this is Williams just outside the D, shoots low, off target, and England look rattled.
[11215.16 - 11220.16] P:1686.60 E:0.113402 |  England really, Spain have missed two really good chances,
[11220.16 - 11224.16] P:1665.09 E:0.118729 |  I wouldn't say that's a chance from Williams, 22-23 yards out,
[11224.16 - 11232.16] P:1658.81 E:0.113017 |  centrally pulls this shot, hits it well, goes a yard, wide of Jordan Pickford's right-hand post,
[11232.16 - 11236.16] P:1691.59 E:0.114282 |  but Spain where they want to be now, in control.
[11237.16 - 11241.16] P:1833.87 E:0.112724 |  That goal for Williams was the first shot on target for Spain,
[11241.16 - 11244.16] P:1793.32 E:0.108956 |  since then they've had another two in the space of six minutes.
[11244.16 - 11247.16] P:1691.68 E:0.110596 |  They're just accumulating pressure now, and that came from a chance,
[11247.16 - 11250.16] P:1754.57 E:0.112239 |  the early Marata chance where he just slipped it past Pickford.
[11250.16 - 11254.16] P:1725.49 E:0.113502 |  I don't think it was going to be on target, but Stones had to deal with it,
[11254.16 - 11257.16] P:1692.78 E:0.104024 |  and then we're a little bit stretched and flustered,
[11257.16 - 11260.16] P:1661.11 E:0.121901 |  Drew Bellingham's doing his thing, but in the wrong area of the pitch, he offloads it,
[11260.16 - 11264.16] P:1650.19 E:0.115076 |  then the ball forward gets cut out, and Spain are brilliant at that.
[11264.16 - 11267.16] P:1676.53 E:0.111986 |  When they want to hunt it back and turn it over, they've got,
[11267.16 - 11271.16] P:1650.78 E:0.113356 |  we've doubled the amount of turnovers in the offensive third in this whole tournament,
[11271.16 - 11274.16] P:1679.96 E:0.102215 |  that's how good they are at possession, and it shows,
[11274.16 - 11277.16] P:1755.62 E:0.115469 |  and then England is so stretched, the shot is easier to come off.
[11278.16 - 11281.16] P:1839.28 E:0.126752 |  Wonderful crossfield ball by Walker to Shaw,
[11281.16 - 11284.16] P:1778.69 E:0.110028 |  played it into Bellingham, did the dummy for it to reach Harry Kane,
[11284.16 - 11288.16] P:1741.14 E:0.111860 |  before it could reach Bellingham, he was taken out, they were looking for a free kick.
[11288.16 - 11291.16] P:1799.12 E:0.115918 |  England have won the ball back, gay heat towards Stones,
[11291.16 - 11297.16] P:1782.33 E:0.111252 |  being urged on by the banks of England's supporters in their white shirts behind that goal.
[11297.16 - 11302.16] P:1739.67 E:0.112380 |  At the marathon gate end of the Olympic Stadium here in Berlin,
[11302.16 - 11306.16] P:1700.86 E:0.109803 |  willing to see Garra Southgate side, get an equaliser,
[11306.16 - 11311.16] P:1712.47 E:0.110908 |  but 57 minutes played in this contest, in this European Championship final,
[11311.16 - 11316.16] P:1625.52 E:0.113373 |  and Oli Watkins is going to be coming on, England are trailing.
[11318.16 - 11325.16] P:1677.14 E:0.112159 |  Yep, I mean it looks like it'll be Harry Kane who comes off as a possibility of playing two up top,
[11325.16 - 11331.16] P:1796.47 E:0.108362 |  but Spain have that high line at the back, and England haven't really exploited it.
[11331.16 - 11333.16] P:1787.57 E:0.115107 |  England and the pressure trying to beat the press,
[11333.16 - 11338.16] P:1890.11 E:0.112598 |  Bryce collected it, was facing his own goal on the edge of the penalty area up towards Manu,
[11338.16 - 11342.16] P:1791.84 E:0.113994 |  running out of space on that far side, and it goes out of play for Spain.
[11342.16 - 11348.16] P:1725.53 E:0.109427 |  You've got to admire the pressure again, Spain apply, it is sensational, I have to say, without the ball.
[11348.16 - 11352.16] P:1666.57 E:0.112011 |  I mean we can talk as much about the wingers, but England have it,
[11352.16 - 11357.16] P:1660.10 E:0.113666 |  they are pressed in and it's organised and the fallback's in, centre-backs are going in with the plate,
[11357.16 - 11361.16] P:1744.61 E:0.112919 |  there's nowhere to go, and England are really struggling to get hold of the ball
[11361.16 - 11363.16] P:1723.03 E:0.110704 |  and build any kind of waves of attacks.
[11363.16 - 11369.16] P:1695.02 E:0.112427 |  It's been a key feature of Spain's play throughout this tournament,
[11369.16 - 11377.16] P:1609.32 E:0.115322 |  whereby far they have been the most impressive side, as they look for a seventh straight win here at the Euros.
[11377.16 - 11383.16] P:1646.91 E:0.116584 |  Back it goes from Le Normand to Simon, his clearance will pick out Olmote,
[11384.16 - 11389.16] P:1805.82 E:0.113105 |  Olmote gets away from the challenge of Bryce, threads it forward to Marata,
[11389.16 - 11395.16] P:1827.26 E:0.108187 |  La Mignumal, who's been doing his English homework during the course of this tournament,
[11395.16 - 11399.16] P:1763.68 E:0.108367 |  he necessarily thought an English exam would come at the end of it,
[11399.16 - 11405.16] P:1720.83 E:0.107938 |  just after passing his 17th birthday, as they now switch it to the left-hand side to Nico Williams.
[11405.16 - 11407.16] P:1850.02 E:0.105356 |  But Spain are in total control.
[11407.16 - 11410.16] P:1648.14 E:0.106920 |  It's not the first kick that Simon's misquoted though, is it?
[11410.16 - 11413.16] P:1650.58 E:0.117165 |  I've seen him a few times in this tournament shank some kicks,
[11413.16 - 11417.16] P:1763.18 E:0.115929 |  he wants a havertz for that great chance, we maybe could have equalised for him.
[11417.16 - 11422.16] P:1834.87 E:0.117897 |  Here is Olmote, looking for Marata into that run of the inside right-hand on the penalty area.
[11422.16 - 11425.16] P:1808.52 E:0.111102 |  Chris, you might recall in the semi-final against France,
[11425.16 - 11429.16] P:1753.03 E:0.118019 |  Simon's distribution went straight to a couple of French players, I recall, late in the second half.
[11429.16 - 11434.16] P:1728.55 E:0.112839 |  Yeah, he's got away with a couple this evening, hasn't he?
[11434.16 - 11439.16] P:1799.94 E:0.116159 |  He's only pretty composed on the ball, but we've all got a shank in us at times, Ian.
[11440.16 - 11443.16] P:1854.93 E:0.119915 |  You see him in the golf course, have you?
[11443.16 - 11447.16] P:1860.11 E:0.115360 |  Here is Bellingham, England trailing, here in Berlin, Bellingham,
[11447.16 - 11450.16] P:1951.46 E:0.111333 |  floats the ball out towards Saka, far side the right,
[11450.16 - 11454.16] P:1911.00 E:0.114477 |  six, seven yards over the halfway line, collects it back to his feet from Walker,
[11454.16 - 11459.16] P:1937.76 E:0.110807 |  runs forward, Cucarera is actually noticeably dropped off Saka on this occasion.
[11459.16 - 11463.16] P:1877.34 E:0.116217 |  Williams is helping out too, back it goes to Saka, Foden makes the run-off,
[11463.16 - 11466.16] P:1860.70 E:0.112209 |  and in towards the penalty area, tried the cut back towards Kane,
[11466.16 - 11469.16] P:1806.40 E:0.105584 |  great defending though by Carvajal, the right back tucked in,
[11469.16 - 11473.16] P:1812.73 E:0.105968 |  England get it back, Maynou, wins that 50-50 against Cucarera,
[11473.16 - 11476.16] P:1835.29 E:0.111611 |  ball loops up into the air on the far side, tries the little flick,
[11476.16 - 11480.16] P:1827.78 E:0.107182 |  doesn't reach Saka, battling for it, gets it away from Williams.
[11480.16 - 11482.16] P:1805.80 E:0.118582 |  England now with every outfield player in the Spain half,
[11482.16 - 11487.16] P:1799.32 E:0.113713 |  looking for an equaliser on five-live in the World Service with half an hour to go.
[11487.16 - 11492.16] P:1750.65 E:0.115294 |  The England supporters respond, and England get a throw midway through the Spain half,
[11492.16 - 11496.16] P:1879.33 E:0.105037 |  as Watkins, who got the winner against the Dutch, comes on,
[11496.16 - 11500.16] P:1864.04 E:0.109381 |  and it's Harry Kane, who now is probably, well, he's played,
[11500.16 - 11506.16] P:1901.75 E:0.112930 |  this is his sixth final for club and country, his previous five, he's yet to win,
[11506.16 - 11511.16] P:1878.24 E:0.115387 |  and still he's yet to score, maybe though could there still be a happy ending
[11511.16 - 11513.16] P:1872.62 E:0.112261 |  if Watkins can deliver some magic.
[11513.16 - 11521.16] P:1829.45 E:0.116732 |  That's a big call from Garry Southgate, Harry Kane hasn't really had any opportunities in this match,
[11521.16 - 11525.16] P:1890.52 E:0.111720 |  and he's just making that switch again, that the sharpness and the brightness
[11525.16 - 11531.16] P:1734.42 E:0.112415 |  that Oli Watkins brings with his mobility, hoping he can have the same kind of impact he did in the semi-final.
[11531.16 - 11537.16] P:1760.31 E:0.106944 |  Here is Gay He to Walker, brings it under control, forward of the centre circle.
[11537.16 - 11542.16] P:1821.45 E:0.101950 |  Now with Maynou, Maynou gets one challenge, comes out towards Bellingham,
[11542.16 - 11545.16] P:1850.27 E:0.107018 |  Bellingham curls it to Saka, bit of space around Saka,
[11545.16 - 11552.16] P:1855.81 E:0.102786 |  closed down now by Kukereya and Williams, support from Walker, in field to Rice,
[11552.16 - 11558.16] P:1687.29 E:0.102253 |  30 yards out from goal, Gay He, runs forward, lays it out,
[11558.16 - 11564.16] P:1792.05 E:0.108268 |  fractally behind Shaw on the left-hand side, Gay He's continued to run, Shaw remains in close proximity,
[11564.16 - 11569.16] P:1796.64 E:0.108927 |  level of the area, Spain though defending well, leading, still protecting that advantage,
[11569.16 - 11577.16] P:1863.26 E:0.113120 |  as Rice plays the ball in field, Walker once again out towards Saka, still they try that ploy,
[11577.16 - 11581.16] P:1869.23 E:0.116449 |  Saka against Williams, upended and he gets the free kick, let's go behind that goal,
[11581.16 - 11584.16] P:1854.20 E:0.117211 |  is he what a reception for Oli Watkins when he came on?
[11584.16 - 11589.16] P:1811.95 E:0.112968 |  Yeah, the fans have been calling for it, they've been singing his name and Gower Southgate responded
[11589.16 - 11594.16] P:1848.93 E:0.106536 |  and Kane was given a fantastic exit applause from the fans as he went off,
[11594.16 - 11598.16] P:1734.54 E:0.101320 |  but I think the fans are absolutely delighted to see Oli Watkins enter the pitch.
[11598.16 - 11604.16] P:1699.64 E:0.109044 |  Now the French referee, Francois L'Étexier is calling Carl Walker and Marata together,
[11605.16 - 11614.16] P:1712.69 E:0.115321 |  it was just the challenge from Williams, upending Saka, and then there was a little bit of a coming together.
[11614.16 - 11621.16] P:1770.82 E:0.118833 |  There's a little something with Kukereya, where he got involved and there was a little grapple and a grip
[11621.16 - 11624.16] P:1734.99 E:0.110570 |  and he just having a word with both skippers.
[11625.16 - 11631.16] P:1790.36 E:0.106519 |  Foden waits to take the free kick, about 10 yards in from the right touch line,
[11631.16 - 11638.16] P:1843.77 E:0.107305 |  not quite level with the penalty area as England all in white play from left to right.
[11639.16 - 11645.16] P:1879.58 E:0.113994 |  Foden wipes the bead of sweat, the England supporters with the thunderclap,
[11645.16 - 11651.16] P:1812.61 E:0.115453 |  building up the anticipation here in Berlin, the arm goes a lot, swings it over now,
[11651.16 - 11657.16] P:1823.05 E:0.106033 |  headed out by Le Porte, headed further away by Yamal and it's Declan Rice who's the one
[11657.16 - 11664.16] P:1798.54 E:0.112772 |  who's got a retreat towards the halfway line and now back to Jordan Pickford all in yellow
[11664.16 - 11670.16] P:1776.96 E:0.112786 |  and Pickford will hit it long, Foden will give chase, Kukereya seem more concerned about Foden
[11670.16 - 11675.16] P:1802.25 E:0.115755 |  than the ball for a time, Foden's got goalside, done well back towards Saka,
[11675.16 - 11680.16] P:1837.52 E:0.117664 |  Saka now on the right hand side, Belligan creeps forward, rolls well, creates the opportunity
[11680.16 - 11683.16] P:1919.13 E:0.110686 |  and shoots left footed just off target.
[11684.16 - 11686.16] P:1858.59 E:0.110691 |  Goal kicks, main still lead.
[11686.16 - 11691.16] P:1794.24 E:0.114357 |  Yeah, England building a bit of momentum, gotta say the take from Belligan,
[11691.16 - 11698.16] P:1799.65 E:0.116398 |  the ball fired across on the edge of the box, Carvalen, Olmo, the Spanish players
[11698.16 - 11705.16] P:1840.14 E:0.119851 |  collide with each other, Belligan has a little pirouette, the ball just gets away from him
[11705.16 - 11708.16] P:1772.79 E:0.109380 |  a little bit and fires a left footed shot.
[11708.16 - 11710.16] P:1699.49 E:0.115659 |  Well, why did the goal?
[11710.16 - 11715.16] P:1766.84 E:0.106527 |  You just feel it's going to have to be something ridiculous like that from Duke Bellingham
[11715.16 - 11720.16] P:1654.21 E:0.116006 |  or Foden or whoever to get England back in this game, it's going to be a little piece
[11720.16 - 11723.16] P:1680.09 E:0.110214 |  of magic on the edge of the box.
[11724.16 - 11727.16] P:1771.36 E:0.121224 |  Put by Farre England's best moment of the second half.
[11731.16 - 11735.16] P:1650.18 E:0.112399 |  It's going to be a goal kick, which Le Porte is going to take,
[11735.16 - 11740.16] P:1635.64 E:0.114999 |  Carvalen is all right to continue after getting treatment, Spain still leading with that goal
[11740.16 - 11744.16] P:1718.34 E:0.114041 |  early in the second half on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[11744.16 - 11748.16] P:1623.08 E:0.115923 |  Don't forget the golf coverage on Thursday from 10 o'clock in the open championship
[11748.16 - 11754.16] P:1724.94 E:0.115970 |  at Royal Trun, the best and comprehensive over four days.
[11754.16 - 11760.16] P:1700.91 E:0.112221 |  And from the tranquil settings of Ayrshire to here we are in Berlin, where it's Raukes
[11760.16 - 11766.16] P:1760.84 E:0.116452 |  and England looking for an equaliser as Watkins with that floated forward ball
[11766.16 - 11770.16] P:1709.68 E:0.115581 |  was just trying to make that run from Le Normand, goes out for a goal kick.
[11770.16 - 11775.16] P:1697.76 E:0.112434 |  And there you go, space in behind, Watkins movement is brilliant,
[11775.16 - 11782.16] P:1718.30 E:0.116439 |  just peels on the shoulder of Le Normand, the ball from Stones is delightful.
[11784.16 - 11787.16] P:1857.57 E:0.128112 |  Watkins nearly gets on the end of it, something different now for the Spanish
[11787.16 - 11789.16] P:1801.27 E:0.114980 |  to think about.
[11789.16 - 11793.16] P:1811.29 E:0.119958 |  And it will create space, Chris, even if Watkins does get on that ball,
[11793.16 - 11799.16] P:1688.45 E:0.117753 |  it might enable Foden and Bellingham to have a little bit more space to do their thing.
[11800.16 - 11805.16] P:1811.69 E:0.117114 |  Seymour's goal kick, he had it back by Stones, he's picked up by Rice,
[11805.16 - 11809.16] P:1606.84 E:0.112260 |  running all the way back to the edge of the D of his own penalty area.
[11810.16 - 11813.16] P:1701.33 E:0.124364 |  There are 25 minutes remaining here in Berlin.
[11814.16 - 11821.16] P:1683.80 E:0.118098 |  And England are facing Euro heartache once again.
[11822.16 - 11826.16] P:1670.07 E:0.110005 |  Pickford goes long, Kukereya plays it forward,
[11826.16 - 11830.16] P:1771.49 E:0.111082 |  Williams has been electrifying in this second half, forward to Marathe,
[11830.16 - 11835.16] P:1880.84 E:0.116096 |  Olmo now towards La Mignol, La Mignol shoots and Pickford with a low save,
[11835.16 - 11840.16] P:1897.61 E:0.112068 |  got down very, very well towards his right to turn it behind for a corner kick.
[11840.16 - 11845.16] P:1756.71 E:0.107042 |  Well, just how big a moment could that be, let's say, from Jordan Pickford.
[11845.16 - 11851.16] P:1776.97 E:0.103544 |  It's so slick from Spain, ball quick switch from Olmo to Yamalu,
[11851.16 - 11854.16] P:1792.82 E:0.110683 |  gets a bit fortunate with his first touch, but he curls beautifully,
[11854.16 - 11859.16] P:1783.67 E:0.107686 |  the ball is heading for the far corner, bending in a Pickford.
[11859.16 - 11862.16] P:1702.60 E:0.113014 |  Big right hand, or little right hand I should say,
[11862.16 - 11865.16] P:1734.08 E:0.109277 |  around the post, crucial right hand.
[11865.16 - 11869.16] P:1757.91 E:0.109292 |  Only three sides have ever overcome a one-goal deficit
[11869.16 - 11875.16] P:1792.93 E:0.111038 |  in a final of the European Championship, as Williams swings in the corner,
[11875.16 - 11879.16] P:1777.37 E:0.110100 |  comes to the edge of the area, Foden gets there first, Manu,
[11879.16 - 11884.16] P:1863.90 E:0.110296 |  Manu looks to shield the ball away from Fabian, and then Marathe gets there,
[11884.16 - 11887.16] P:1912.35 E:0.114898 |  and then hammers the ball into the advertising hoardings,
[11887.16 - 11891.16] P:1906.92 E:0.107842 |  the Spanish players are pumped up, and they actually get the throw as well
[11891.16 - 11893.16] P:1837.20 E:0.115222 |  on this right hand side.
[11893.16 - 11896.16] P:1674.37 E:0.100108 |  As Spain are going to be making a change,
[11896.16 - 11900.16] P:1702.95 E:0.108050 |  and Oya Sabel is going to be coming on.
[11900.16 - 11904.16] P:1695.14 E:0.111954 |  He is a player who served Luis de La Puente so well,
[11904.16 - 11910.16] P:1730.65 E:0.111604 |  he was part of the under-21 Euro success back in 2019.
[11910.16 - 11914.16] P:1733.35 E:0.118440 |  He's appeared in all seven games now,
[11914.16 - 11917.16] P:1837.51 E:0.113937 |  as Marathe turns to applaud the Spanish support,
[11917.16 - 11921.16] P:1868.92 E:0.113030 |  bearing in mind that the Spanish captain has said
[11921.16 - 11925.16] P:1889.93 E:0.103413 |  this is likely to be his last major tournament.
[11925.16 - 11930.16] P:1678.85 E:0.112690 |  Truly, his own perceived lack of respect in his own country.
[11930.16 - 11934.16] P:1890.05 E:0.107594 |  So he makes way, is it farewell to Elvaro Marathe?
[11934.16 - 11937.16] P:1887.67 E:0.102514 |  We shall see, but Miquel Oya Sabel comes on.
[11937.16 - 11940.16] P:1720.50 E:0.101338 |  Another player from Real Sociedad.
[11940.16 - 11944.16] P:1701.51 E:0.114788 |  Well, any number nine looking about link up, hold up play,
[11944.16 - 11947.16] P:1672.38 E:0.109486 |  I mean, that's been a masterclass from Marathe this evening.
[11947.16 - 11949.16] P:1756.84 E:0.117287 |  We're midway through the second half,
[11949.16 - 11953.16] P:1772.84 E:0.102893 |  and England have the remaining quarter to salvage it here in Berlin
[11953.16 - 11956.16] P:1755.38 E:0.107352 |  on five-line to take it through to full-time.
[11956.16 - 11958.16] P:1720.55 E:0.103445 |  Here's John Murray.
[11958.16 - 11959.16] P:1624.73 E:0.108693 |  Thank you, Ian.
[11959.16 - 11963.16] P:1667.56 E:0.115150 |  Darkness has now fallen here in Berlin,
[11963.16 - 11966.16] P:1706.37 E:0.122342 |  and England are trailing in the final.
[11966.16 - 11970.16] P:1665.74 E:0.113727 |  Pickford takes this goal kick out to Walker on the far side.
[11970.16 - 11973.16] P:1784.41 E:0.117106 |  Then back to Walker, who is under pressure.
[11973.16 - 11976.16] P:1920.80 E:0.113664 |  There are spaces now opening up for Spain.
[11976.16 - 11979.16] P:1828.65 E:0.107819 |  All-Mall with a left-handed ball flicked into the penalty area.
[11979.16 - 11981.16] P:1803.23 E:0.114800 |  Stone's headed away wide of goal,
[11981.16 - 11984.16] P:1825.60 E:0.111542 |  but it will bounce out for a corner on the right-hand side.
[11984.16 - 11989.16] P:1908.51 E:0.116917 |  And as England do try to force the issue in a Spana in a position here, Chris,
[11989.16 - 11992.16] P:1864.64 E:0.108045 |  where they could quite easily pick England off.
[11992.16 - 11994.16] P:1735.07 E:0.112777 |  Yep, absolutely.
[11994.16 - 11996.16] P:1655.74 E:0.119932 |  England need to be brave on the ball,
[11996.16 - 11999.16] P:1717.20 E:0.112167 |  but I've got to say, we marvelled at the way Spain
[11999.16 - 12001.16] P:1617.03 E:0.120192 |  have played in this tournament on the ball,
[12001.16 - 12006.16] P:1790.86 E:0.109249 |  but off the ball, they work so hard to win the ball back.
[12006.16 - 12010.16] P:1843.67 E:0.113328 |  So a corner to be taken from just down to our right here by Yamal.
[12010.16 - 12012.16] P:1844.97 E:0.104612 |  Left-footed in, it goes.
[12012.16 - 12014.16] P:1865.11 E:0.106451 |  Pickford comes, gets an awkward punch on it, actually.
[12014.16 - 12015.16] P:1761.90 E:0.105697 |  It bounces out of the area.
[12015.16 - 12018.16] P:1870.67 E:0.106550 |  All-Mall on the left-hand side, his side cross.
[12018.16 - 12021.16] P:1870.92 E:0.110419 |  Pickford comes again and dives and gets something on that.
[12021.16 - 12025.16] P:1853.84 E:0.103844 |  A left-faced, I think it was, away from a crowd of players.
[12025.16 - 12027.16] P:1830.60 E:0.104030 |  Williams gets there ahead of Saka.
[12027.16 - 12030.16] P:1849.40 E:0.113561 |  Now on the right-hand side, it swung right across to the back post,
[12030.16 - 12033.16] P:1687.03 E:0.099937 |  where Gay had to make that header, which he did.
[12033.16 - 12037.16] P:1848.21 E:0.115520 |  Spain really prushing now, and then Ruiz with a shot from 25 yards.
[12037.16 - 12040.16] P:1913.66 E:0.109798 |  That flies over by a yard or so.
[12040.16 - 12043.16] P:1856.48 E:0.113058 |  It remains 1-0, but England under pressure.
[12043.16 - 12046.16] P:1865.82 E:0.113772 |  Yeah, a couple of really lovely moments from Spain there.
[12046.16 - 12049.16] P:1835.34 E:0.103881 |  Ruiz hits his strike with his left foot.
[12049.16 - 12054.16] P:1813.56 E:0.114309 |  Jordan Pickford, rather unconventionally dealing with a couple of crosses
[12054.16 - 12055.16] P:1803.52 E:0.114095 |  into the box by punching.
[12055.16 - 12057.16] P:1802.48 E:0.115554 |  The first one was actually really quite poor,
[12057.16 - 12058.16] P:1825.16 E:0.116182 |  just drops it down into the box.
[12058.16 - 12061.16] P:1733.59 E:0.113054 |  Second one gets good distance,
[12061.16 - 12064.16] P:1813.63 E:0.116084 |  but when these waves of balls into the box and attacks
[12064.16 - 12068.16] P:1823.38 E:0.115673 |  and Spain start to build, we really do get a little bit ragged, England.
[12068.16 - 12071.16] P:1916.78 E:0.119445 |  And, you know, that's where we're at,
[12071.16 - 12073.16] P:1894.65 E:0.117001 |  and we just can't get out of the ball, John.
[12073.16 - 12075.16] P:1815.48 E:0.119010 |  It's just nowhere near good enough with the ball,
[12075.16 - 12077.16] P:1858.35 E:0.119600 |  and the pressure from Spain is superb.
[12077.16 - 12079.16] P:1900.16 E:0.116662 |  Yep, we've played almost 70 minutes,
[12079.16 - 12081.16] P:1904.84 E:0.113138 |  and Garis Southgate makes another change.
[12081.16 - 12082.16] P:1981.65 E:0.103711 |  Cole Palmer is on.
[12082.16 - 12088.16] P:1812.58 E:0.116505 |  Cole Palmer coming on for his fifth appearance at this Euro.
[12088.16 - 12091.16] P:1867.98 E:0.112696 |  As England break downfield, but as Watkins battled for it,
[12091.16 - 12094.16] P:1860.85 E:0.111802 |  it was cleared away, and Palmer has come on for Manu.
[12094.16 - 12096.16] P:1860.34 E:0.114345 |  So Manu has been taken off,
[12096.16 - 12098.16] P:1867.09 E:0.104630 |  so this is quite a significant change for England.
[12098.16 - 12102.16] P:1778.86 E:0.117504 |  Yeah, just for a second, that one long ball,
[12102.16 - 12107.16] P:1827.34 E:0.114140 |  and looked like the Spanish end-a-halves hadn't dealt with it well enough,
[12107.16 - 12109.16] P:1795.01 E:0.114991 |  and Watkins had an opportunity.
[12109.16 - 12111.16] P:1785.83 E:0.112327 |  Palmer's pass, that's cut out by Cugareya,
[12111.16 - 12113.16] P:1866.70 E:0.103150 |  and it will bounce to the red shirts of Spain.
[12113.16 - 12117.16] P:1805.91 E:0.107095 |  Fabian Ruiz, although it's won back by Saka, now on the right-hand side.
[12117.16 - 12120.16] P:1800.91 E:0.114621 |  Just need to see how England have rearranged this now.
[12120.16 - 12126.16] P:1749.34 E:0.102945 |  Cole Palmer, someone you could see him fitting very nicely into this Spanish side.
[12126.16 - 12128.16] P:1723.51 E:0.110872 |  There's Spain with Carvajal.
[12128.16 - 12131.16] P:1778.47 E:0.107951 |  Carvajal just moves into England territory,
[12131.16 - 12133.16] P:1683.87 E:0.109909 |  then all-mall back out to the right-hand side,
[12133.16 - 12135.16] P:1680.02 E:0.115214 |  where Yamal goes back into his own home.
[12135.16 - 12137.16] P:1685.60 E:0.124599 |  Yeah, we want to see Cole Palmer
[12137.16 - 12140.16] P:1559.90 E:0.116596 |  fit well into the England team, John, this evening.
[12140.16 - 12142.16] P:1525.83 E:0.112253 |  Yes, that's the priority.
[12142.16 - 12146.16] P:1727.79 E:0.113179 |  There will be a 6-0-6 on five-life, by the way, with Chris and Robbie Savage.
[12146.16 - 12150.16] P:1698.71 E:0.110058 |  So the lines will be open, 08, 08, 05, 9, 09, 6, 9, 3.
[12150.16 - 12153.16] P:1703.20 E:0.114457 |  As Simon clears up to the half-way line,
[12153.16 - 12156.16] P:1764.25 E:0.111455 |  Shaw goes in tight with Yamal.
[12156.16 - 12158.16] P:1783.38 E:0.117150 |  Now here is Oyazaba,
[12158.16 - 12163.16] P:1805.09 E:0.117098 |  and the referee's brought it back for an offside flight against Oyazaba.
[12163.16 - 12166.16] P:1711.69 E:0.118552 |  So 1-0 it is, and Tain is already running out.
[12166.16 - 12168.16] P:1645.45 E:0.106648 |  20 minutes to go.
[12168.16 - 12171.16] P:1715.47 E:0.115874 |  Yeah, it looks like Palmer has come on,
[12171.16 - 12174.16] P:1571.31 E:0.126978 |  and he's playing narrow off that right-hand side.
[12174.16 - 12177.16] P:1675.36 E:0.123189 |  Bowden has come across narrow off the left-hand.
[12177.16 - 12179.16] P:1651.86 E:0.115694 |  Bellingham has just dropped a little bit,
[12179.16 - 12183.16] P:1621.20 E:0.118727 |  not necessarily in the main position that deep.
[12183.16 - 12186.16] P:1579.23 E:0.124089 |  But he's certainly more central, Bellingham.
[12186.16 - 12188.16] P:1684.23 E:0.123597 |  It's a positive change, though, Chris, isn't it,
[12188.16 - 12191.16] P:1657.85 E:0.123675 |  that he's made in that stage of the game,
[12191.16 - 12193.16] P:1784.40 E:0.123387 |  where if you don't do something, it'll just pass you by.
[12193.16 - 12195.16] P:1877.50 E:0.121404 |  Bellingham slides in, doesn't make the pass.
[12195.16 - 12197.16] P:1844.96 E:0.110306 |  Now it's played for Oyazaba, left side of the area,
[12197.16 - 12199.16] P:1978.56 E:0.112162 |  shoots from an angle, but straight at Pickford.
[12199.16 - 12202.16] P:1848.18 E:0.111722 |  And he's able to deal with that quite comfortably
[12202.16 - 12204.16] P:1797.43 E:0.114128 |  and plays it out to Bellingham,
[12204.16 - 12206.16] P:1920.02 E:0.112866 |  who is very quick there, quick area, committed himself.
[12206.16 - 12208.16] P:1956.45 E:0.112098 |  Now Palmer to Saka down the right-hand side.
[12208.16 - 12210.16] P:1955.05 E:0.106137 |  England attack with Saka.
[12210.16 - 12212.16] P:1830.17 E:0.111811 |  Bowden and Watkins in the penalty area.
[12212.16 - 12214.16] P:1798.73 E:0.103672 |  Saka still in possession across to Bellingham.
[12214.16 - 12216.16] P:1876.30 E:0.112249 |  Back to Palmer, left for charge!
[12216.16 - 12218.16] P:2134.71 E:0.114491 |  One-one!
[12219.16 - 12221.16] P:2051.33 E:0.113097 |  Col Palmer!
[12221.16 - 12224.16] P:1919.97 E:0.108918 |  He's got the dead eye for England!
[12224.16 - 12227.16] P:1921.25 E:0.115803 |  What a finish that was!
[12227.16 - 12230.16] P:1770.32 E:0.118349 |  Spine were opened up there!
[12230.16 - 12233.16] P:1765.79 E:0.116220 |  And Col Palmer took full advantage.
[12233.16 - 12236.16] P:1700.95 E:0.117516 |  And England are back level.
[12237.16 - 12239.16] P:1539.66 E:0.121106 |  One-one the score.
[12239.16 - 12242.16] P:1784.20 E:0.120636 |  England take full advantage there.
[12242.16 - 12245.16] P:1813.43 E:0.118528 |  A quick ball from Jordan Pickford.
[12245.16 - 12248.16] P:1936.12 E:0.114116 |  It all starts with the England keeper.
[12248.16 - 12250.16] P:1739.99 E:0.117221 |  Great spot from him.
[12250.16 - 12252.16] P:1858.25 E:0.119496 |  Spine on the attack, they commit bodies forward.
[12252.16 - 12254.16] P:1896.34 E:0.102668 |  But then he pings it out,
[12254.16 - 12256.16] P:1821.23 E:0.117335 |  and ends up with Palmer, who feeds Saka.
[12256.16 - 12259.16] P:1801.67 E:0.113634 |  It's one-by-one in that position.
[12259.16 - 12261.16] P:1850.66 E:0.110660 |  Chops and changes, it comes in.
[12261.16 - 12263.16] P:1755.94 E:0.113291 |  Bellingham with the setback onto the edge of the box.
[12263.16 - 12266.16] P:1801.46 E:0.118335 |  And is this ever been more tailor-made
[12266.16 - 12268.16] P:1872.23 E:0.109901 |  for a left-footed effort on goal?
[12268.16 - 12271.16] P:1851.87 E:0.106182 |  But I have to say, that is composure.
[12271.16 - 12273.16] P:1827.01 E:0.115040 |  That is super technique.
[12273.16 - 12275.16] P:1851.97 E:0.109004 |  He picks his spot, Palmer.
[12275.16 - 12277.16] P:1812.08 E:0.110035 |  He doesn't get flustered.
[12277.16 - 12279.16] P:1861.48 E:0.114812 |  He's up a body, he's over the ball.
[12279.16 - 12281.16] P:1740.36 E:0.113137 |  He just places it with real power
[12281.16 - 12283.16] P:1906.69 E:0.113172 |  and precision in the far corner.
[12283.16 - 12286.16] P:1809.56 E:0.109833 |  Absolutely fantastic finish from Col Palmer.
[12286.16 - 12288.16] P:1854.66 E:0.111503 |  Scored by Palmer in the goal.
[12288.16 - 12291.16] P:1887.53 E:0.111321 |  Where is he? Christensen is down behind.
[12291.16 - 12294.16] P:1848.67 E:0.118320 |  Well, well, well, we have what's called limbs again.
[12294.16 - 12297.16] P:1827.45 E:0.116808 |  The noise behind me is unbelievable.
[12297.16 - 12300.16] P:1928.57 E:0.116146 |  I saw Col Palmer strike a few of those in the warm-up.
[12300.16 - 12303.16] P:1818.97 E:0.113943 |  And he's just done the exact same at the time
[12303.16 - 12306.16] P:1815.12 E:0.105752 |  when his country needed him. What a finish.
[12306.16 - 12308.16] P:1831.21 E:0.106143 |  Spain won England 1.
[12308.16 - 12312.16] P:1877.45 E:0.111628 |  Col Palmer scoring very much, as Matt Upson said,
[12312.16 - 12316.16] P:1895.08 E:0.117633 |  in the manner that he scored all of those goals for Chelsea this season.
[12316.16 - 12318.16] P:1805.04 E:0.112685 |  25 of them, Chris Sutton.
[12318.16 - 12321.16] P:1658.90 E:0.121203 |  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there was an argument
[12321.16 - 12324.16] P:1678.94 E:0.115314 |  coming into the tournament that he should start going for boys.
[12324.16 - 12326.16] P:1685.29 E:0.111684 |  He made a difference from the bench.
[12326.16 - 12329.16] P:1746.83 E:0.116163 |  And once again, the layback from Bellingham was first-class.
[12329.16 - 12332.16] P:1845.57 E:0.112163 |  Loudoun to come on to it. Left footed.
[12332.16 - 12335.16] P:1863.35 E:0.114679 |  And now the ball is won back by Bellingham.
[12335.16 - 12337.16] P:1874.19 E:0.115306 |  And he has Palmer again with a little bit of space.
[12337.16 - 12340.16] P:1887.24 E:0.103141 |  Gives it to Saka. Saka against Kukareya.
[12340.16 - 12342.16] P:1948.49 E:0.107052 |  Kakes him on on the outside.
[12342.16 - 12344.16] P:1891.29 E:0.115148 |  Gets a low ball across that is cleared away
[12344.16 - 12346.16] P:1933.96 E:0.118817 |  on the edge of the six-yard box by La Porte.
[12346.16 - 12349.16] P:1815.17 E:0.122703 |  And now listen to this from the England supporters.
[12349.16 - 12354.16] P:1810.94 E:0.118126 |  Thousands and thousands of them here in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin.
[12354.16 - 12358.16] P:1797.59 E:0.117709 |  They sense that England, having been one-nil down
[12358.16 - 12361.16] P:1827.39 E:0.116650 |  since the second minute of the second half,
[12361.16 - 12364.16] P:1785.31 E:0.106842 |  now with that super strike from Palmer.
[12364.16 - 12367.16] P:1765.69 E:0.113027 |  What was it? Maybe 22, 23 yards out.
[12367.16 - 12370.16] P:1725.61 E:0.115340 |  That flew low into the bottom corner.
[12370.16 - 12373.16] P:1640.55 E:0.108338 |  Now all-square again.
[12373.16 - 12375.16] P:1687.98 E:0.117592 |  England with Palmer.
[12375.16 - 12377.16] P:1844.75 E:0.113240 |  Again in the full-back position.
[12377.16 - 12379.16] P:1814.30 E:0.122400 |  In comes the challenge, you know.
[12379.16 - 12383.16] P:1830.62 E:0.119163 |  It goes and Palmer himself says to the England supporters over there.
[12383.16 - 12387.16] P:1709.87 E:0.116825 |  Raises his hands, tells them to make more noise.
[12387.16 - 12390.16] P:1668.58 E:0.119219 |  He's a remarkable young man, isn't he, Palmer?
[12390.16 - 12393.16] P:1728.64 E:0.121616 |  He is. He doesn't lack confidence.
[12393.16 - 12397.16] P:1829.31 E:0.117280 |  Such a classy player, but just going back to that save,
[12397.16 - 12401.16] P:1796.28 E:0.108853 |  John from Jordan Pickford from the Yamala.
[12401.16 - 12404.16] P:1759.30 E:0.117161 |  But how crucial has that been?
[12404.16 - 12408.16] P:1773.27 E:0.115295 |  The chances that they had, the opportunity that Old Moe had
[12408.16 - 12411.16] P:1750.15 E:0.110257 |  that shot at Chris, the face of goal, Marata as well.
[12411.16 - 12413.16] P:1593.78 E:0.108490 |  But they couldn't get the second goal.
[12413.16 - 12416.16] P:1737.00 E:0.115541 |  And Ian mentioned how rare it is that in a European championship
[12416.16 - 12418.16] P:1602.47 E:0.118212 |  a team will win from being a goal down.
[12418.16 - 12420.16] P:1711.14 E:0.109234 |  As Pickford launches one downfield,
[12420.16 - 12423.16] P:1708.47 E:0.108590 |  that will bounce all the way through for a goal kick.
[12423.16 - 12426.16] P:1768.39 E:0.117620 |  It did actually happen in the last European championship final,
[12426.16 - 12429.16] P:1630.81 E:0.113089 |  where England led for such a long time.
[12429.16 - 12434.16] P:1649.81 E:0.119898 |  And it ended up in a penalty shootout that was won by the Italians.
[12434.16 - 12436.16] P:1727.64 E:0.119508 |  That was three years ago.
[12436.16 - 12439.16] P:1738.80 E:0.114240 |  Now there are 15 minutes to play.
[12439.16 - 12442.16] P:1600.43 E:0.124164 |  And a quite different-looking England team now
[12442.16 - 12444.16] P:1720.13 E:0.116275 |  that we're looking down on here with the changes
[12444.16 - 12448.16] P:1638.26 E:0.115125 |  that Gary Southgate has made with Kane and Maynou coming off.
[12448.16 - 12450.16] P:1723.59 E:0.120607 |  So, Fellingham now central.
[12450.16 - 12452.16] P:1573.41 E:0.116884 |  Parma is quite central too.
[12452.16 - 12454.16] P:1641.46 E:0.116417 |  And only Watkins through the middle.
[12454.16 - 12457.16] P:1645.64 E:0.119634 |  Yeah, but a bit more energy.
[12457.16 - 12459.16] P:1667.89 E:0.110686 |  Maybe a bit more belief.
[12459.16 - 12461.16] P:1665.61 E:0.117924 |  I mean, he's got the vacuum off.
[12461.16 - 12463.16] P:1634.40 E:0.118011 |  Spain, Parma for England.
[12463.16 - 12465.16] P:1602.34 E:0.113045 |  He's pretty fearless as well, isn't he?
[12465.16 - 12468.16] P:1680.85 E:0.117245 |  I mean, it isn't just been the theme of England's games
[12468.16 - 12470.16] P:1696.81 E:0.115553 |  almost through this whole tournament.
[12470.16 - 12473.16] P:1779.19 E:0.114803 |  I mean, we've seen so many where they've started
[12473.16 - 12475.16] P:1805.68 E:0.111197 |  to go on behind, they've been hanging on,
[12475.16 - 12478.16] P:1767.43 E:0.104300 |  and they come back and those changes off the bench
[12478.16 - 12480.16] P:1787.67 E:0.111911 |  have a huge impact.
[12480.16 - 12482.16] P:1758.82 E:0.106592 |  He has all-mall though.
[12482.16 - 12487.16] P:1746.25 E:0.107483 |  All-mall. One of the six joint top scorers.
[12487.16 - 12489.16] P:1806.07 E:0.109509 |  Harry Kane won't score any more after.
[12489.16 - 12491.16] P:1896.91 E:0.117480 |  He was substituted.
[12491.16 - 12494.16] P:1880.29 E:0.119614 |  He has Yamal. Yamal in field.
[12494.16 - 12497.16] P:1894.43 E:0.120103 |  Now it's driven on down into the full-back position
[12497.16 - 12500.16] P:1881.65 E:0.117579 |  by Carvajal, who's now got the captain's armband
[12500.16 - 12503.16] P:1811.69 E:0.117009 |  in incidentally since Marata was taken off.
[12503.16 - 12506.16] P:1658.56 E:0.118668 |  Yamal, Spain were rocked by the equaliser.
[12506.16 - 12509.16] P:1699.30 E:0.113168 |  Of course, they would be, but now they're back
[12509.16 - 12511.16] P:1759.09 E:0.115628 |  in their stride again.
[12511.16 - 12513.16] P:1792.16 E:0.112795 |  Here's Cucarrea on the car side.
[12513.16 - 12516.16] P:1677.76 E:0.119022 |  Saca chases him, ball in field,
[12516.16 - 12519.16] P:1707.07 E:0.114979 |  towards the other Spanish substitute, Zubimendi.
[12519.16 - 12522.16] P:1683.18 E:0.115517 |  Now Williams back to Cucarrea.
[12522.16 - 12524.16] P:1830.89 E:0.122821 |  It's 1-1 if you've just switched on.
[12524.16 - 12526.16] P:1614.26 E:0.113929 |  If you're on your way home, it's on BBC One tonight.
[12526.16 - 12529.16] P:1551.93 E:0.111356 |  Here is Lleon O'Mound.
[12529.16 - 12531.16] P:1655.38 E:0.122197 |  Fabian Noury, just thought of a centre-circle.
[12531.16 - 12533.16] P:1643.30 E:0.107286 |  Gives it to his right.
[12533.16 - 12536.16] P:1782.24 E:0.114244 |  Lleon O'Mound uses Carvajal on the right-hand side.
[12536.16 - 12538.16] P:1834.27 E:0.113610 |  Carvajal's ball in, that looks dangerous.
[12538.16 - 12540.16] P:1754.05 E:0.113849 |  It's gone a long way. Walk-up.
[12540.16 - 12542.16] P:1664.57 E:0.103862 |  Allowed it to bounce, and it bounced past him,
[12542.16 - 12544.16] P:1643.16 E:0.114298 |  but Williams had to run out into the full-back position.
[12544.16 - 12546.16] P:1661.69 E:0.108370 |  He's got it now.
[12546.16 - 12548.16] P:1775.10 E:0.120524 |  The Spaniard into the near post,
[12548.16 - 12550.16] P:1693.62 E:0.116907 |  and an excellent header won by John Stornes,
[12550.16 - 12553.16] P:1705.58 E:0.112606 |  who's bitten the pressure there from Oyazabao.
[12553.16 - 12556.16] P:1679.41 E:0.115064 |  And it is a corner though from the left-hand side for Spain.
[12556.16 - 12558.16] P:1495.49 E:0.119276 |  It does well.
[12558.16 - 12560.16] P:1653.07 E:0.121453 |  Williams shifts the ball on the outside of Carl Walker.
[12560.16 - 12562.16] P:1689.87 E:0.112580 |  Stanzela put a...
[12562.16 - 12564.16] P:1765.34 E:0.113217 |  ...cross-up strong, strong in the challenge.
[12564.16 - 12566.16] P:1848.01 E:0.114554 |  I thought he was fouled.
[12567.16 - 12569.16] P:1874.82 E:0.127121 |  Ozzabao.
[12569.16 - 12572.16] P:1949.77 E:0.122244 |  And should have had a free kick.
[12572.16 - 12574.16] P:1930.58 E:0.119464 |  Corner for Spain.
[12574.16 - 12577.16] P:1800.18 E:0.118713 |  Williams to take. The man who opened the scoring.
[12577.16 - 12580.16] P:1640.88 E:0.114811 |  Referee, LaTexiae, just...
[12580.16 - 12582.16] P:1677.35 E:0.111938 |  There you can hear him.
[12582.16 - 12585.16] P:1730.67 E:0.113392 |  He's not happy with some of the things that are going on.
[12585.16 - 12587.16] P:1858.05 E:0.110322 |  In comes the corner, headed away by Balingham.
[12587.16 - 12589.16] P:1838.44 E:0.112663 |  It comes out to Fabian Ruiz.
[12589.16 - 12591.16] P:1874.69 E:0.113387 |  Miscontrolled it, plays it across the box,
[12591.16 - 12593.16] P:1882.13 E:0.110458 |  and Parmas there underneath it, just to...
[12593.16 - 12597.16] P:1763.79 E:0.112913 |  ...to pull it away, and it will land just approximately one foot
[12597.16 - 12599.16] P:1654.65 E:0.112270 |  from where Gareth Southgate is standing there.
[12599.16 - 12602.16] P:1655.74 E:0.114099 |  Gareth Southgate first-hand.
[12602.16 - 12606.16] P:1705.24 E:0.118844 |  There's England manager to take a team into two finals.
[12606.16 - 12609.16] P:1692.00 E:0.116416 |  And it's in the balance, still in the balance.
[12609.16 - 12612.16] P:1724.83 E:0.122345 |  When there were one nil up, Spain had seen as though a second goal
[12612.16 - 12614.16] P:1740.50 E:0.121187 |  wasn't too far away, but it didn't come.
[12614.16 - 12618.16] P:1708.51 E:0.113381 |  And that goal parma equalised that super goal that it was.
[12618.16 - 12623.16] P:1714.61 E:0.115306 |  His first on this kind of stage, his first big tournament goal.
[12623.16 - 12626.16] P:1572.53 E:0.117739 |  And what is...
[12628.16 - 12631.16] P:1671.10 E:0.115833 |  ...still an infant England career,
[12631.16 - 12635.16] P:1590.81 E:0.113215 |  a Spain comfort, with it on the left-hand side.
[12635.16 - 12639.16] P:1556.53 E:0.112698 |  To play that to the far side by Zubemendi.
[12639.16 - 12642.16] P:1661.50 E:0.109369 |  And then back towards the halfway line.
[12642.16 - 12645.16] P:1802.79 E:0.118312 |  Spain lost Rodry to injury at half-time,
[12645.16 - 12647.16] P:1934.74 E:0.122160 |  but then within seconds they've taken the lead.
[12647.16 - 12649.16] P:1885.01 E:0.110406 |  He has Carvajal now.
[12649.16 - 12652.16] P:1926.06 E:0.114927 |  Carvajal, ball forward into the penalty area on the right-hand side.
[12652.16 - 12655.16] P:1896.99 E:0.112941 |  Oh, Yazabaal keeps it in, but he slipped as he did so.
[12655.16 - 12657.16] P:1917.24 E:0.115184 |  And actually the ball bounced out of play,
[12657.16 - 12659.16] P:1945.11 E:0.119959 |  and it is a goal kick to England.
[12659.16 - 12661.16] P:1856.23 E:0.117718 |  And we have ten minutes to go.
[12661.16 - 12663.16] P:1780.65 E:0.107278 |  It's flashed by, hasn't it?
[12663.16 - 12667.16] P:1784.66 E:0.117662 |  It is, but England's strong suit in this tournament
[12667.16 - 12672.16] P:1666.66 E:0.116169 |  has been the way that they finish games.
[12672.16 - 12677.16] P:1755.33 E:0.118105 |  They come back into games three times before tonight.
[12677.16 - 12681.16] P:1811.07 E:0.121317 |  They came back, got over the line. Can they do it again?
[12681.16 - 12686.16] P:1795.89 E:0.115562 |  Yeah, last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, no shortage of drama.
[12686.16 - 12689.16] P:1696.77 E:0.109294 |  As Pickford takes the goal kick through the middle,
[12689.16 - 12692.16] P:1724.84 E:0.114301 |  Spain have got it, and we'll play it back to Simon in the goal.
[12692.16 - 12695.16] P:1760.11 E:0.119867 |  In front of Izzy Christensen, down at pitch level.
[12695.16 - 12699.16] P:1592.31 E:0.107000 |  I've just noticed a very frantic signal from Lin Oman,
[12699.16 - 12703.16] P:1713.42 E:0.100545 |  the centre-back for Spain, to the bench to substitute.
[12703.16 - 12707.16] P:1695.45 E:0.109248 |  So I think he must be struggling, in which case if he does go off,
[12707.16 - 12711.16] P:1621.28 E:0.110977 |  that could be another little swing into the advantage of England again.
[12711.16 - 12713.16] P:1759.06 E:0.097867 |  Thank you, Izzy.
[12713.16 - 12716.16] P:1712.18 E:0.121126 |  Imagine that would be Nacho, who would come on,
[12716.16 - 12720.16] P:1769.85 E:0.124069 |  which is not a bad replacement for the Real Madrid Champions League
[12720.16 - 12722.16] P:1608.16 E:0.116920 |  winning captain.
[12722.16 - 12724.16] P:1786.01 E:0.113357 |  He's off now, isn't he, of course?
[12724.16 - 12727.16] P:1608.37 E:0.121965 |  I think he's won a few things, hasn't he, Nacho, over the years?
[12727.16 - 12731.16] P:1766.82 E:0.110083 |  Yeah, he might win a few more things in Saudi Arabia.
[12731.16 - 12733.16] P:1599.55 E:0.114298 |  Who knows?
[12733.16 - 12738.16] P:1522.36 E:0.119293 |  Spain won, England won, and Fabian Ruiz inside his own half.
[12738.16 - 12743.16] P:1719.48 E:0.111032 |  Lines are open on five-lives for 6-0-6, 08, 08, 5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3
[12743.16 - 12746.16] P:1804.10 E:0.116683 |  to talk to Robbie and Chris once everything's wrapped up here.
[12746.16 - 12748.16] P:1820.80 E:0.115709 |  Foulden does extremely well to win it back.
[12748.16 - 12750.16] P:1767.39 E:0.113950 |  Bellingham, and now Palmer.
[12750.16 - 12753.16] P:1883.58 E:0.114382 |  Palmer's dispossessed, Williams carries it forward.
[12753.16 - 12756.16] P:1847.50 E:0.110539 |  Williams, there are defenders back up to the edge of the D.
[12756.16 - 12759.16] P:1742.68 E:0.118325 |  Just lays it off, Danny Olmore, through to Williams.
[12759.16 - 12761.16] P:1897.22 E:0.120576 |  Williams back to Olmore.
[12761.16 - 12763.16] P:1930.17 E:0.102724 |  Now, Yamal, all good save, Pickford.
[12763.16 - 12768.16] P:1848.12 E:0.113566 |  Really opened up for the 17-year-old, but he couldn't pass Pickford.
[12768.16 - 12772.16] P:1817.49 E:0.117570 |  Well, that's two crucial saves.
[12772.16 - 12774.16] P:1707.77 E:0.115779 |  Incredible save from Pickford.
[12774.16 - 12776.16] P:1538.27 E:0.109876 |  He read the shot from Yamalu.
[12776.16 - 12779.16] P:1643.83 E:0.113211 |  Once again, the ball sat from trying to find the far corner.
[12779.16 - 12782.16] P:1724.12 E:0.111965 |  Pickford did it brilliantly, palmed the shot out.
[12782.16 - 12784.16] P:1694.53 E:0.112483 |  I think Yamal should be scoring now.
[12784.16 - 12788.16] P:1787.25 E:0.110402 |  Should be scoring, but Pickford, one-on-one.
[12788.16 - 12790.16] P:1742.03 E:0.112064 |  It was from an angle the shot on his left foot,
[12790.16 - 12793.16] P:1792.81 E:0.111141 |  but Pickford was able to beat it away.
[12793.16 - 12796.16] P:1785.42 E:0.120870 |  Spain won, England won.
[12796.16 - 12799.16] P:1800.17 E:0.120444 |  Spain looked it again here.
[12799.16 - 12803.16] P:1807.82 E:0.118575 |  We've got eight minutes to play, plus added time.
[12803.16 - 12807.16] P:1751.42 E:0.123620 |  Again, Cavian Nerees, Cavian Ruiz back to the right-hand side,
[12807.16 - 12808.16] P:1830.41 E:0.105560 |  to Carvajal.
[12808.16 - 12811.16] P:1656.30 E:0.110521 |  Carvajal, though, goes back to Leung-Normand near the halfway line.
[12811.16 - 12815.16] P:1738.67 E:0.113311 |  And, yeah, Natjo is being prepared to come on with his immaculate hair.
[12815.16 - 12817.16] P:1790.15 E:0.115693 |  He has Williams on the left-hand side.
[12817.16 - 12818.16] P:1875.02 E:0.121811 |  Walker does well.
[12818.16 - 12820.16] P:1876.85 E:0.114050 |  Walker managed to win it from him,
[12820.16 - 12824.16] P:1822.31 E:0.115436 |  but then the challenge came in from Zubin M.D.
[12824.16 - 12825.16] P:1717.93 E:0.112958 |  And here we will have that change.
[12825.16 - 12828.16] P:1723.83 E:0.115416 |  And, yeah, he's got a problem. Leung-Normand hasn't been.
[12828.16 - 12831.16] P:1647.16 E:0.114615 |  Yeah, like you say, it's a good replacement.
[12831.16 - 12833.16] P:1632.85 E:0.116054 |  Plenty of experience and know-how,
[12833.16 - 12836.16] P:1725.56 E:0.111192 |  but Spain just stepped it up a gear out of possession.
[12836.16 - 12838.16] P:1693.43 E:0.116790 |  I'm having a look at the replay from Yamal.
[12838.16 - 12841.16] P:1693.65 E:0.114087 |  Yamal, he doesn't hit the corner anywhere near.
[12841.16 - 12844.16] P:1700.94 E:0.109525 |  Well enough, Jordan Pickford, you know,
[12844.16 - 12847.16] P:1632.19 E:0.124958 |  fully anticipating the ball to be bent right into that far post,
[12847.16 - 12850.16] P:1562.84 E:0.133781 |  and he just hits it, kind of catches it a little bit central.
[12850.16 - 12853.16] P:1632.13 E:0.116328 |  Yamal makes the save a little bit easier for Pickford,
[12853.16 - 12855.16] P:1465.67 E:0.122309 |  but it was Cole Palmer that just got robbed
[12855.16 - 12858.16] P:1785.19 E:0.102669 |  from just fantastic midfield pressure from Spain
[12858.16 - 12860.16] P:1755.10 E:0.112949 |  to turn the ball over again.
[12860.16 - 12863.16] P:1702.08 E:0.103783 |  And this game now, wow, it is so well-poised.
[12863.16 - 12866.16] P:1632.17 E:0.108140 |  Yes, it is. The 34-year-old Natjo is on.
[12866.16 - 12868.16] P:1784.47 E:0.108352 |  England played forward towards Bellingham,
[12868.16 - 12870.16] P:1610.88 E:0.108855 |  who got up in the challenge with Le Port,
[12870.16 - 12875.16] P:1636.43 E:0.112114 |  but over both of them through to Simon on the edge of his penalty area.
[12875.16 - 12879.16] P:1588.55 E:0.112639 |  Spain played forward towards Fabian Ruiz,
[12879.16 - 12883.16] P:1571.66 E:0.116388 |  and then he has Natjo in possession for the first time.
[12883.16 - 12886.16] P:1575.80 E:0.114020 |  It's not bad when you've got experience like that
[12886.16 - 12887.16] P:1625.87 E:0.110175 |  to bring him to the field.
[12887.16 - 12892.16] P:1632.20 E:0.118535 |  Natjo after just the 23 years at Real Madrid.
[12892.16 - 12897.16] P:1646.55 E:0.114132 |  Spain, Zubinendi now. Zubinendi.
[12897.16 - 12900.16] P:1677.86 E:0.116225 |  Natjo makes himself available in the centre-circle,
[12900.16 - 12903.16] P:1609.91 E:0.115424 |  and then steps forward, strives forward,
[12903.16 - 12905.16] P:1590.17 E:0.110797 |  rolls the ball to his left,
[12905.16 - 12908.16] P:1599.71 E:0.116987 |  or Yazaba makes a run, but the ball stayed with all-mour.
[12908.16 - 12910.16] P:1641.60 E:0.114137 |  Williams, Williams 25 yards out.
[12910.16 - 12912.16] P:1594.50 E:0.108749 |  He has Yamal again.
[12912.16 - 12914.16] P:1718.06 E:0.110259 |  Now to Carvajal on the right-hand side.
[12914.16 - 12915.16] P:1696.71 E:0.119492 |  This is danger for England.
[12915.16 - 12918.16] P:1695.90 E:0.108962 |  Carvajal back to Fabian Ruiz,
[12918.16 - 12920.16] P:1811.15 E:0.113897 |  and again to Carvajal on the right,
[12920.16 - 12922.16] P:1881.78 E:0.115780 |  blocked by Killforden,
[12922.16 - 12924.16] P:1829.49 E:0.112990 |  and bounces back for Carvajal,
[12924.16 - 12926.16] P:1712.68 E:0.114534 |  who's able to keep possession for Spain.
[12926.16 - 12928.16] P:1638.25 E:0.116164 |  Yamal from a deep-lying position.
[12928.16 - 12930.16] P:1638.49 E:0.119506 |  Williams, Williams, the 22-year-old,
[12930.16 - 12932.16] P:1710.82 E:0.114018 |  bounces back to Williams,
[12932.16 - 12934.16] P:1761.80 E:0.115190 |  and then a touch from an England player,
[12934.16 - 12936.16] P:1833.45 E:0.118295 |  sends it wide, well wide of the goal,
[12936.16 - 12938.16] P:1879.84 E:0.108849 |  but it's a corner to Spain.
[12938.16 - 12942.16] P:1777.33 E:0.106418 |  Very little space in and around the box.
[12942.16 - 12944.16] P:1707.31 E:0.110647 |  Ball, Spain, but Williams finds a way,
[12944.16 - 12947.16] P:1648.93 E:0.106136 |  pops the ball into Olmote, tries to receive it.
[12947.16 - 12951.16] P:1687.38 E:0.113288 |  And it's put behind for the Spanish corner.
[12951.16 - 12954.16] P:1747.56 E:0.116306 |  So Yamal trots across.
[12954.16 - 12957.16] P:1723.47 E:0.115483 |  Williams, Yamal's birthday yesterday,
[12957.16 - 12959.16] P:1699.95 E:0.111036 |  Williams' birthday the day before.
[12959.16 - 12961.16] P:1748.58 E:0.108120 |  The two of them together.
[12961.16 - 12963.16] P:1761.36 E:0.117683 |  Yamal left for it into the edge of the six-yard box,
[12963.16 - 12964.16] P:1723.28 E:0.107791 |  stones heads it down and away,
[12964.16 - 12966.16] P:1784.95 E:0.114569 |  and Oates players collided at the back post.
[12966.16 - 12969.16] P:1754.54 E:0.110481 |  Gay ended up on the ground.
[12969.16 - 12973.16] P:1767.00 E:0.116968 |  The Zubemendi was challenging him,
[12973.16 - 12975.16] P:1847.36 E:0.117149 |  but the ball was cleared away downfield,
[12975.16 - 12978.16] P:1787.15 E:0.114895 |  and the Spanish goalkeeper, Simon, quickly out to Cucarreal.
[12978.16 - 12980.16] P:1837.46 E:0.106446 |  One won the score, five live from the BBC,
[12980.16 - 12982.16] P:1809.29 E:0.115049 |  and the World Service.
[12982.16 - 12985.16] P:1809.25 E:0.110925 |  Long one for it for Yamal, into the area on the right-hand side.
[12985.16 - 12987.16] P:1887.40 E:0.106842 |  Yamal hooks it across, Pickford comes, gets a hand to it,
[12987.16 - 12990.16] P:1906.76 E:0.115018 |  and just manages to touch it away,
[12990.16 - 12993.16] P:1838.47 E:0.114976 |  and keep possession to take it away from Oyazabao.
[12993.16 - 12996.16] P:1798.70 E:0.112104 |  And a sun ball over the top for Yamal,
[12996.16 - 12998.16] P:1745.27 E:0.114866 |  absolutely inch-perfect from the field,
[12998.16 - 13001.16] P:1823.88 E:0.113541 |  just curved over the top of Luke Shaw,
[13001.16 - 13003.16] P:1809.97 E:0.108897 |  and Pickford tapping the ball with his hand,
[13003.16 - 13006.16] P:1899.20 E:0.109441 |  catching it just after he touches it on the penalty spot.
[13006.16 - 13008.16] P:1971.51 E:0.103074 |  You've just got to be careful,
[13008.16 - 13012.16] P:1949.87 E:0.115337 |  you expect that patient build-up from Spain all the time,
[13012.16 - 13014.16] P:1964.54 E:0.114955 |  but every now and then they've got the capabilities
[13014.16 - 13016.16] P:2003.13 E:0.118466 |  of just flipping that one in behind,
[13016.16 - 13019.16] P:1958.12 E:0.119333 |  which makes it so difficult that you have to get your position
[13019.16 - 13021.16] P:1982.38 E:0.116745 |  in spot on all the time.
[13021.16 - 13024.16] P:1940.14 E:0.116870 |  Changes number three and four are coming for England.
[13024.16 - 13027.16] P:1875.05 E:0.108084 |  Trippier was preparing himself, but he's put his bib back on,
[13027.16 - 13030.16] P:1866.26 E:0.110037 |  so it looks as though it's going to be Conagallica coming on next
[13031.16 - 13034.16] P:1793.38 E:0.102066 |  for England, the Chelsea man.
[13034.16 - 13037.16] P:1697.02 E:0.110015 |  Occasionally the Chelsea captain this season,
[13037.16 - 13039.16] P:1788.43 E:0.125542 |  as Spain played through the middle, he has all-mour again,
[13039.16 - 13042.16] P:1851.60 E:0.111357 |  all-mour through the middle, Oyazabao back out to the left-hand side
[13042.16 - 13045.16] P:1969.05 E:0.114260 |  to Kukarea, and on the ball, he's in!
[13045.16 - 13047.16] P:2065.51 E:0.114662 |  Kukarea with the pass,
[13047.16 - 13051.16] P:1968.12 E:0.112059 |  and Oyazabao on the edge of the six-yard area,
[13051.16 - 13056.16] P:1860.08 E:0.109857 |  finds a way past Pickford, and Spain are back in front,
[13057.16 - 13061.16] P:1646.13 E:0.128976 |  with Audley, less than four minutes to play.
[13061.16 - 13065.16] P:1502.16 E:0.125924 |  It's Spain two, England one, that could be the clincher,
[13065.16 - 13071.16] P:1475.81 E:0.132682 |  that could be the goal that beats England in the final year in Berlin.
[13071.16 - 13076.16] P:1628.40 E:0.133941 |  Well, what a hammer blow at this stage in the game.
[13076.16 - 13079.16] P:1550.54 E:0.136200 |  England dragging themselves back into this match
[13079.16 - 13082.16] P:1546.92 E:0.127330 |  with a fantastic goal from Palmer,
[13083.16 - 13087.16] P:1608.08 E:0.126504 |  and the Spanish have just created another opportunity of their own,
[13087.16 - 13091.16] P:1642.18 E:0.121993 |  and he's tucked it away, I mean, it's a simple touch into the box,
[13091.16 - 13095.16] P:1611.56 E:0.122224 |  I mean, it's a great ball in, the space was on that far side,
[13095.16 - 13097.16] P:1547.08 E:0.130636 |  it goes through Olimo in midfield,
[13097.16 - 13101.16] P:1700.89 E:0.123452 |  he flicks it into Alazabao, who plays it first time wide,
[13101.16 - 13103.16] P:1596.28 E:0.120488 |  and it's a very tight offside shot,
[13103.16 - 13108.16] P:1713.34 E:0.115484 |  but Kukarea finds a delivery, it's a brilliant ball in,
[13108.16 - 13113.16] P:1755.08 E:0.110715 |  Walker just misses it by a fraction to block the cross,
[13113.16 - 13118.16] P:1794.10 E:0.114365 |  as such is the quality of the ball from Kukarea first time on the ground,
[13118.16 - 13121.16] P:1708.45 E:0.115993 |  and the centre forward does what every great centre forward does
[13121.16 - 13123.16] P:1704.46 E:0.110295 |  in terms of getting across their marker,
[13123.16 - 13125.16] P:1658.57 E:0.119199 |  and he gets the first touch on the ground,
[13125.16 - 13129.16] P:1621.62 E:0.122935 |  steers it past Pickford, who's got no chance really,
[13129.16 - 13132.16] P:1624.11 E:0.122368 |  it's such close range, it's nearly on the six-yard box line,
[13132.16 - 13136.16] P:1644.17 E:0.133574 |  and Spain stepping to the lead again.
[13136.16 - 13139.16] P:1699.68 E:0.124657 |  Just looking to see if the referee is going to allow the restart,
[13139.16 - 13142.16] P:1843.10 E:0.112032 |  because there was a tight ace offside in there,
[13142.16 - 13145.16] P:1657.47 E:0.126530 |  Garas Southgate's changed his plans, Ivan Tony's now coming on,
[13145.16 - 13150.16] P:1660.42 E:0.120402 |  not from the Gallica, Chris, yeah, the England resumed play,
[13150.16 - 13152.16] P:1788.59 E:0.110675 |  the goal stands, Spain to England, one.
[13152.16 - 13155.16] P:1764.02 E:0.117288 |  Yeah, I've got to say, it was so, so tight,
[13155.16 - 13158.16] P:1798.08 E:0.116609 |  got to get Tony on that, throw everything at it.
[13158.16 - 13162.16] P:1816.21 E:0.119768 |  We've now, we're in the 88th minute, England are two-one down,
[13162.16 - 13165.16] P:1880.84 E:0.119772 |  they've come from being eliminated.
[13165.16 - 13167.16] P:1927.36 E:0.119792 |  Oh, ball played through to Watkins,
[13167.16 - 13169.16] P:1776.50 E:0.111894 |  Watkins on the turn, but it got away from him,
[13169.16 - 13171.16] P:1884.59 E:0.112494 |  Dalyngan played it through, brilliant pass,
[13171.16 - 13173.16] P:1876.09 E:0.118355 |  and on the turn, it just got away from Watkins,
[13173.16 - 13175.16] P:1715.35 E:0.115982 |  and Spain put it behind for a corner.
[13175.16 - 13178.16] P:1748.41 E:0.118092 |  I tell you what, he's so unlucky, Olly Watkins,
[13178.16 - 13181.16] P:1694.35 E:0.120808 |  positioning great in between the two Spanish centre halves,
[13181.16 - 13183.16] P:1769.82 E:0.117404 |  just lets his first touch, little pirouette,
[13183.16 - 13185.16] P:1738.30 E:0.113230 |  his first touch gets away from him,
[13185.16 - 13191.16] P:1718.63 E:0.111477 |  that allows the experienced Nat Joe to get round and clear the danger.
[13191.16 - 13195.16] P:1781.95 E:0.114785 |  Right, Tony is on, Foden is off, Phil Foden is off.
[13195.16 - 13198.16] P:1824.37 E:0.122456 |  Garry Southgate going for it here, he has to,
[13198.16 - 13201.16] P:1797.17 E:0.117144 |  Marino is going to come on as well for Spain,
[13201.16 - 13205.16] P:1752.77 E:0.115489 |  so Luis de la Fuente is taking off the young man,
[13205.16 - 13209.16] P:1816.54 E:0.127146 |  Yamal, who's being played, replayed,
[13209.16 - 13213.16] P:1762.14 E:0.127151 |  but yeah, it will happen now, they're taking some time over this,
[13213.16 - 13216.16] P:1877.90 E:0.126636 |  he's off, so Yamal, who could have finished it,
[13216.16 - 13219.16] P:1651.40 E:0.123902 |  actually when he had that chance, the Pickford saved,
[13219.16 - 13222.16] P:1826.69 E:0.120776 |  the Yazzabals, second goal for Spain,
[13222.16 - 13227.16] P:1707.92 E:0.125349 |  so Marino is on, Parma with the corner from the left-hand side,
[13227.16 - 13230.16] P:1593.00 E:0.128609 |  we're almost into the 90th minute here,
[13230.16 - 13234.16] P:1881.35 E:0.112557 |  England, again, facing defeat at the Euros,
[13234.16 - 13238.16] P:1828.05 E:0.120161 |  have got to come up with something, they did it in the last 16,
[13238.16 - 13241.16] P:1912.15 E:0.112764 |  they did it in the quarter-final, they did it in the semi-final,
[13241.16 - 13243.16] P:1965.35 E:0.113309 |  here's the final, Parma's in, rise for that,
[13243.16 - 13245.16] P:1994.19 E:0.106599 |  brilliant save, it's headed for it,
[13245.16 - 13249.16] P:1951.58 E:0.109852 |  it was headed off the line, it was headed brilliantly off the line,
[13249.16 - 13253.16] P:1962.15 E:0.107289 |  Gani Almo, somehow got that away,
[13253.16 - 13256.16] P:1947.07 E:0.112372 |  the initial header from Rice, brilliantly saved,
[13256.16 - 13260.16] P:1867.15 E:0.104738 |  and then Gays' header, what a clearance that was,
[13260.16 - 13265.16] P:1902.74 E:0.108636 |  the header from Gays, the header from Gays was straight at Almo on the line,
[13265.16 - 13268.16] P:1840.38 E:0.117113 |  and in that moment, in that moment, that could be it,
[13268.16 - 13272.16] P:1801.83 E:0.099651 |  that could be the clincher, is he right in front of you?
[13272.16 - 13276.16] P:1724.45 E:0.117255 |  Oh my word, that was so, so close, it was Gani Almo on the line,
[13276.16 - 13278.16] P:1720.08 E:0.104410 |  wasn't it, excellent reading from him,
[13278.16 - 13283.16] P:1751.69 E:0.112617 |  but it was like pinball inside the box, so, so close from England.
[13285.16 - 13289.16] P:1791.37 E:0.114265 |  That was Gani, oh no, there, from England's perspective,
[13289.16 - 13292.16] P:1680.08 E:0.120578 |  I've got to say the initial head-up from Declan Rice,
[13292.16 - 13294.16] P:1584.23 E:0.122491 |  I think he should get that further into the corner,
[13294.16 - 13298.16] P:1872.10 E:0.106920 |  it's a decent save from Simon,
[13298.16 - 13302.16] P:1910.06 E:0.113854 |  who dives to his right-hand side, golden opportunity,
[13302.16 - 13306.16] P:1904.96 E:0.115633 |  Gaihi, that's instinctive, but Almo in the right place,
[13306.16 - 13309.16] P:1873.21 E:0.105137 |  and Spain hanging on.
[13309.16 - 13311.16] P:1864.71 E:0.119617 |  We are into four minutes of added time,
[13311.16 - 13314.16] P:1689.14 E:0.112504 |  but rather England will have an opportunity as good as that,
[13314.16 - 13316.16] P:1789.93 E:0.111471 |  Spain on the way to victory,
[13316.16 - 13319.16] P:1823.95 E:0.111543 |  on the way to winning this trophy for the fourth time,
[13319.16 - 13325.16] P:1795.43 E:0.108721 |  England looks like it's going to be two consecutive defeats
[13325.16 - 13327.16] P:1809.06 E:0.110944 |  in European Championship finals,
[13327.16 - 13331.16] P:1854.10 E:0.104388 |  but there are still best part of four minutes, Matt.
[13331.16 - 13334.16] P:1785.13 E:0.115244 |  Well, I'm just trying to recover from that opportunity,
[13334.16 - 13337.16] P:1775.67 E:0.111713 |  I was convinced that that was going to get in the back of the net,
[13337.16 - 13340.16] P:1710.71 E:0.110095 |  I mean the head-up from Rice had plenty of power,
[13340.16 - 13342.16] P:1783.55 E:0.116452 |  maybe he could have steered it a little bit further,
[13342.16 - 13345.16] P:1909.36 E:0.118913 |  wider the keeper, but I mean, what a mele.
[13345.16 - 13348.16] P:1825.27 E:0.109397 |  Spain have won a free kick on the edge of that penalty area,
[13348.16 - 13351.16] P:1902.97 E:0.116885 |  after, and it's a yellow card that has been showing,
[13351.16 - 13354.16] P:1839.67 E:0.117720 |  I think it was a high footing on Nacho there,
[13354.16 - 13358.16] P:1898.84 E:0.107667 |  he's ended up on the ground, it's kicked by Watkins.
[13358.16 - 13363.16] P:1906.04 E:0.117416 |  It's an accidental high boot from Watkins,
[13363.16 - 13367.16] P:1822.48 E:0.116482 |  trying to win the ball, does catch the defender,
[13367.16 - 13371.16] P:1763.64 E:0.118991 |  Gugarae's reaction is so over the top,
[13371.16 - 13373.16] P:1807.15 E:0.119140 |  and you know what the Spanish will do now,
[13373.16 - 13377.16] P:1826.54 E:0.111095 |  they'll take the time, no rush,
[13377.16 - 13382.16] P:1747.31 E:0.112276 |  try and run down the clock with a gamesmanship.
[13382.16 - 13386.16] P:1744.74 E:0.113906 |  But every team, every club team, every international team,
[13386.16 - 13389.16] P:1831.20 E:0.116665 |  these are the rules of the modern game.
[13389.16 - 13392.16] P:1801.93 E:0.118644 |  So it's a free kick to Spain,
[13392.16 - 13394.16] P:1828.70 E:0.123668 |  we've still got just over two minutes to go,
[13394.16 - 13397.16] P:1731.50 E:0.116408 |  I see Rodry down there who had to go off at half-time,
[13397.16 - 13399.16] P:1749.59 E:0.111281 |  Rodry's trying to marshal the troops,
[13399.16 - 13402.16] P:1719.76 E:0.113030 |  Garae Southgate standing with his left hand on his hip,
[13402.16 - 13407.16] P:1584.47 E:0.112797 |  he's made his changes, Tony is on, alongside Watkins,
[13407.16 - 13411.16] P:1783.41 E:0.104099 |  Rice lifted forward, final seconds these,
[13411.16 - 13413.16] P:1877.80 E:0.114897 |  he has Palmer, the man who gave England hope,
[13413.16 - 13416.16] P:1919.37 E:0.111590 |  cold Palmer, still inside his own half though,
[13416.16 - 13419.16] P:1966.58 E:0.113245 |  Palmer is fouled by Williams, free kick,
[13419.16 - 13421.16] P:1882.39 E:0.111853 |  England have to take it, does that,
[13421.16 - 13423.16] P:1823.30 E:0.113509 |  he plays it to Gae in the centre circle,
[13423.16 - 13425.16] P:1880.11 E:0.118555 |  losing possession, actually wins a free kick,
[13425.16 - 13427.16] P:1851.05 E:0.112451 |  Danny Olomou files,
[13427.16 - 13430.16] P:1712.25 E:0.121710 |  Danny almost contribution there to clear it off the line,
[13430.16 - 13432.16] P:1893.75 E:0.120039 |  he's going to be one of the joint top scorers,
[13432.16 - 13435.16] P:1895.13 E:0.113907 |  could almost be given another goal for clearing it off the line.
[13435.16 - 13438.16] P:1645.64 E:0.122862 |  Absolutely, Ryder's made such an impact at the other end
[13438.16 - 13442.16] P:1719.79 E:0.124946 |  of the pitch, false pane, but that looks like
[13442.16 - 13444.16] P:1733.79 E:0.125867 |  it's going to be crucial.
[13444.16 - 13446.16] P:1665.60 E:0.129650 |  90 seconds to play,
[13446.16 - 13448.16] P:1642.11 E:0.126735 |  by the standards of the Slovakia match,
[13448.16 - 13450.16] P:1656.10 E:0.115077 |  this is still early for England,
[13450.16 - 13452.16] P:1821.58 E:0.118532 |  Pickford, longer the edge of the area,
[13452.16 - 13454.16] P:1823.48 E:0.102898 |  headed out to Saka on the right-hand side,
[13454.16 - 13457.16] P:1873.77 E:0.118427 |  Kukarela goes close, Kukarela is a
[13457.16 - 13459.16] P:1907.09 E:0.117509 |  wins a free kick, I guess there must have been
[13459.16 - 13461.16] P:1865.70 E:0.114523 |  a flailing arm there from Saka,
[13461.16 - 13464.16] P:1857.11 E:0.114076 |  and Kukarela has ended up in a heap on the ground.
[13464.16 - 13467.16] P:1882.87 E:0.116506 |  He's got every right to get his arm out there, Saka,
[13467.16 - 13470.16] P:1849.85 E:0.111921 |  he's just protected himself, it's not a foul,
[13470.16 - 13473.16] P:1919.03 E:0.115181 |  he's thrown himself on the floor, I mean,
[13473.16 - 13476.16] P:1876.74 E:0.119371 |  I don't think he particularly catches him either,
[13476.16 - 13479.16] P:1879.61 E:0.117800 |  but he's just not a foul, he's got every right to get his arm out,
[13479.16 - 13481.16] P:1825.55 E:0.116156 |  and we look at a replay of the goal,
[13481.16 - 13485.16] P:1831.52 E:0.119820 |  and the half-tight the offside was on that.
[13485.16 - 13488.16] P:1886.36 E:0.124036 |  Normally if you go down like Kukarela did there,
[13488.16 - 13492.16] P:1887.60 E:0.111158 |  you get stretched off, I mean, it's absolutely pathetic,
[13492.16 - 13494.16] P:1820.66 E:0.106509 |  he did four rolls,
[13494.16 - 13499.16] P:1860.90 E:0.112207 |  and guess what? He's back in his feet, and he's all right.
[13499.16 - 13503.16] P:1826.55 E:0.111513 |  It looks as though England are going to fall at the last.
[13503.16 - 13506.16] P:1821.92 E:0.115099 |  We've got 30 seconds of added time to play,
[13506.16 - 13508.16] P:1812.08 E:0.113224 |  Spain haven't taken this free kick yet,
[13508.16 - 13513.16] P:1828.32 E:0.114525 |  all of the Spanish substitutes, the unused substitutes,
[13513.16 - 13516.16] P:1732.09 E:0.112914 |  the coaching staff are waiting on the edge of the pitch,
[13516.16 - 13518.16] P:1944.07 E:0.117232 |  Paul Ford Gay gets a touch to that,
[13518.16 - 13520.16] P:1805.56 E:0.109979 |  the referee's given England the free kick,
[13520.16 - 13523.16] P:1810.38 E:0.110911 |  that means this is last chance, this is last chance,
[13523.16 - 13526.16] P:1860.62 E:0.111689 |  for England and Gareth Southgate,
[13526.16 - 13529.16] P:1895.80 E:0.117154 |  the team with the late, late show at this Euros,
[13529.16 - 13533.16] P:1915.41 E:0.117414 |  there is no more time, Spain have won it,
[13533.16 - 13538.16] P:1864.58 E:0.111369 |  England are beaten, Gareth Southgate stands with his hands on his hips,
[13538.16 - 13544.16] P:1776.33 E:0.108624 |  not to be again, no happy ending for Gareth Southgate,
[13544.16 - 13547.16] P:1773.56 E:0.119473 |  no glorious final chapter.
[13547.16 - 13551.16] P:1648.62 E:0.121365 |  Gareth Southgate goes across to the winning coach,
[13551.16 - 13555.16] P:1583.17 E:0.116826 |  Luis Delo 20, says well done,
[13555.16 - 13557.16] P:1657.66 E:0.124814 |  Spain 2-1 winners,
[13557.16 - 13560.16] P:1718.56 E:0.113868 |  England players down all over the pitch,
[13560.16 - 13565.16] P:1693.18 E:0.119590 |  and Spain win the European Championship by winning all seven matches,
[13565.16 - 13569.16] P:1668.44 E:0.116229 |  there's no question the best team has won this tournament,
[13569.16 - 13574.16] P:1603.32 E:0.117203 |  but England beaten finalists at Wembley in Euro 2020,
[13574.16 - 13579.16] P:1577.03 E:0.121271 |  now beaten finalists at Euro 2024, here in Berlin,
[13579.16 - 13581.16] P:1491.72 E:0.119884 |  2-1 the final score.
[13581.16 - 13585.16] P:1599.79 E:0.129877 |  I don't think anybody could argue that Spain didn't deserve it,
[13585.16 - 13588.16] P:1616.69 E:0.125366 |  they had better opportunities, they were the dominant team,
[13588.16 - 13591.16] P:1389.68 E:0.127215 |  they've been the outstanding team in the tournament,
[13591.16 - 13594.16] P:1682.55 E:0.122202 |  and in many respects they had to do it the hard way tonight,
[13594.16 - 13599.16] P:1561.45 E:0.128413 |  losing Rodri, their leader in the middle of the park at half time,
[13599.16 - 13601.16] P:1742.93 E:0.120037 |  you're worried about them second half,
[13601.16 - 13603.16] P:1494.08 E:0.120429 |  they came out of the traps in the second half,
[13603.16 - 13607.16] P:1676.24 E:0.119894 |  got themselves in front, but England have proved their gutsy throughout the tournament,
[13607.16 - 13609.16] P:1380.10 E:0.118838 |  they proved their resilience,
[13609.16 - 13612.16] P:1512.38 E:0.125590 |  couple of substitutions, Game On made a difference,
[13612.16 - 13614.16] P:1743.31 E:0.114753 |  Palmer got them back into it,
[13614.16 - 13619.16] P:1637.16 E:0.115771 |  but it's a really slick move from Spain for the Asabelt,
[13619.16 - 13621.16] P:1761.40 E:0.119883 |  good ball out wide to Kukareya,
[13621.16 - 13623.16] P:1742.50 E:0.106668 |  inch perfect cross,
[13623.16 - 13625.16] P:1690.82 E:0.124423 |  and I think his nickname for Asabelt is Bigfoot,
[13625.16 - 13628.16] P:1658.58 E:0.115898 |  he got his Bigfoot onto the ball, into the back of the net,
[13628.16 - 13632.16] P:1434.69 E:0.116740 |  and it's Spain's deserved title.
[13632.16 - 13635.16] P:1630.52 E:0.129448 |  Matt, can't argue with that,
[13635.16 - 13640.16] P:1530.32 E:0.118106 |  I mean, as much as you will and you want it to happen for England,
[13640.16 - 13643.16] P:1582.26 E:0.122309 |  and I'm desperate for that, we all want to see it,
[13643.16 - 13645.16] P:1629.30 E:0.103407 |  we want to feel it,
[13645.16 - 13649.16] P:1788.09 E:0.112059 |  you cannot argue with over the tournament,
[13649.16 - 13653.16] P:1832.04 E:0.107662 |  and for the lion's share of this game,
[13653.16 - 13657.16] P:1835.98 E:0.117448 |  Spain have showed what a quality outfit they really are,
[13657.16 - 13659.16] P:1748.77 E:0.109857 |  with some exciting talent,
[13659.16 - 13662.16] P:1836.53 E:0.114816 |  they've got a lovely way of creating chances,
[13662.16 - 13667.16] P:1714.17 E:0.112701 |  very, very good goals with quick, slick passing from wide areas,
[13667.16 - 13670.16] P:1636.67 E:0.108168 |  and England did their best to hang in there,
[13670.16 - 13673.16] P:1736.62 E:0.109736 |  produced a brilliant moment from Cole Palmer,
[13673.16 - 13678.16] P:1703.70 E:0.109940 |  but yet again, we end up in this position and it's heartbreaking,
[13678.16 - 13681.16] P:1566.96 E:0.108497 |  but you can't disagree that Spain deserve it.
[13681.16 - 13684.16] P:1779.10 E:0.107368 |  Yep, just like Wembley three years ago,
[13684.16 - 13688.16] P:1720.15 E:0.109909 |  Gareth Southgate and his team are going to have to walk past
[13688.16 - 13693.16] P:1672.31 E:0.106579 |  that Henri Delonée trophy and pick up the runners-up medals
[13693.16 - 13699.16] P:1680.92 E:0.118478 |  after Spain win by two goals to one against England here in Berlin.
[13699.16 - 13701.16] P:1717.37 E:0.115901 |  Matt Chappell.
[13701.16 - 13705.16] P:1743.37 E:0.117296 |  And as the stage comes on to the field
[13705.16 - 13709.16] P:1661.14 E:0.119810 |  and England players continue to console each other,
[13709.16 - 13712.16] P:1768.79 E:0.116584 |  Gareth Southgate goes round them all,
[13712.16 - 13716.16] P:1706.15 E:0.112867 |  and some of the subs have come out to console the players
[13716.16 - 13718.16] P:1653.45 E:0.108387 |  that have been playing.
[13718.16 - 13722.16] P:1865.01 E:0.106210 |  Jordan Pickford alone in yellow
[13722.16 - 13726.16] P:1870.49 E:0.109827 |  goes over to the fans behind your goal, is he, actually?
[13726.16 - 13728.16] P:1853.05 E:0.114753 |  And is applauded in there.
[13728.16 - 13731.16] P:1718.49 E:0.111103 |  Joined by another goalkeeper, Aaron Ramstell.
[13731.16 - 13735.16] P:1762.59 E:0.116134 |  Yeah, Jordan Pickford has been absolutely exceptional.
[13735.16 - 13738.16] P:1796.67 E:0.112177 |  Those couple of saves, Chris mentioned it in commentary.
[13738.16 - 13742.16] P:1820.26 E:0.112429 |  They could have been so, so crucial for England
[13742.16 - 13744.16] P:1771.03 E:0.117114 |  to keep them in the game,
[13744.16 - 13746.16] P:1838.24 E:0.114935 |  but when Col Palmer equalised,
[13746.16 - 13750.16] P:1830.35 E:0.112663 |  you thought that the momentum had shifted right back into England's favour
[13750.16 - 13753.16] P:1829.74 E:0.117147 |  and that England would perhaps go on a win it,
[13753.16 - 13757.16] P:1853.03 E:0.113592 |  but you've got to hand it to Spain to absorb that English pressure
[13757.16 - 13759.16] P:1780.33 E:0.111412 |  to then get themselves back on the front foot.
[13759.16 - 13762.16] P:1780.80 E:0.112511 |  And Jordan Pickford, he could do nothing about that winning goal.
[13762.16 - 13765.16] P:1819.86 E:0.110568 |  It was right in front of him. It was a clean finish.
[13765.16 - 13768.16] P:1551.23 E:0.110869 |  And Guillaume, I know, I wonder if he's still with us up there,
[13768.16 - 13770.16] P:1681.45 E:0.104303 |  but we were wrong all along about Kukareya
[13770.16 - 13773.16] P:1589.99 E:0.109708 |  providing that assist for the winning goal in the European final.
[13773.16 - 13777.16] P:1722.09 E:0.110427 |  The interesting thing with the Kukareya assist was
[13777.16 - 13779.16] P:1826.88 E:0.107379 |  Kyle Walker, who has been,
[13779.16 - 13782.16] P:1653.25 E:0.113059 |  I think everybody would agree was England's best player on the night
[13782.16 - 13785.16] P:1677.22 E:0.106173 |  and was immense in the first half.
[13785.16 - 13790.16] P:1726.09 E:0.110215 |  Kyle Walker sank to his knees after that cross was put in.
[13790.16 - 13792.16] P:1642.95 E:0.106367 |  I don't know if you thought, look,
[13792.16 - 13795.16] P:1609.52 E:0.106649 |  it would be great to have tactically made to tell me that ups,
[13795.16 - 13798.16] P:1636.74 E:0.121193 |  but it was all of half a yard out of position, maybe, if that.
[13798.16 - 13802.16] P:1822.51 E:0.107195 |  If that, but, and he was half an inch away
[13802.16 - 13805.16] P:1755.42 E:0.114974 |  from getting a tiny nick on the ball and just deflecting it into a different path.
[13805.16 - 13807.16] P:1832.54 E:0.110076 |  I mean, they're the margins, aren't they?
[13807.16 - 13810.16] P:1713.92 E:0.108136 |  It was tiny and it must be so frustrating for him,
[13810.16 - 13813.16] P:1812.75 E:0.114660 |  but it was all one touch. The ball into him was lovely from Olomo.
[13813.16 - 13816.16] P:1784.01 E:0.109694 |  He could have gone wide earlier, but he decides to go central,
[13816.16 - 13819.16] P:1717.62 E:0.108042 |  which then Walker has to adjust his position a little bit,
[13819.16 - 13822.16] P:1827.17 E:0.105554 |  and then it goes back out wide to Kukareya.
[13822.16 - 13826.16] P:1832.14 E:0.107151 |  He's then on his bike, but first time cross was inch perfect.
[13826.16 - 13830.16] P:1838.39 E:0.104757 |  And, you know, the finish from Bigfoot did the job.
[13830.16 - 13833.16] P:1767.58 E:0.114914 |  The Spaniards at the moment are in front of their fans
[13833.16 - 13835.16] P:1659.64 E:0.113473 |  and celebrate, they've actually left the pitch
[13835.16 - 13838.16] P:1726.71 E:0.107544 |  and gone on to the surrounding areas.
[13838.16 - 13842.16] P:1782.83 E:0.103966 |  Big old stadium, this is a big gap between the pitch and the stands.
[13842.16 - 13845.16] P:1789.34 E:0.109347 |  So there's a real throng of them over there
[13845.16 - 13848.16] P:1714.95 E:0.107564 |  and the photographers are following them as well.
[13848.16 - 13852.16] P:1780.03 E:0.109455 |  And to be fair to them, Guillem, to be fair to the Spanish team,
[13852.16 - 13856.16] P:1847.41 E:0.101060 |  they could have had three, four, maybe five in the second half.
[13856.16 - 13858.16] P:1729.87 E:0.117988 |  It is the way to read it.
[13858.16 - 13861.16] P:1767.82 E:0.108495 |  Spain has the things that make you a champion.
[13861.16 - 13866.16] P:1859.39 E:0.117345 |  Layers, resilience, quality, personality in a place like Wembley,
[13866.16 - 13871.16] P:1791.09 E:0.110704 |  and the ability, the mental strength to turn things around.
[13871.16 - 13875.16] P:1767.35 E:0.109545 |  One is a difficult moment, like considering that goal from England.
[13875.16 - 13879.16] P:1834.49 E:0.109401 |  And England didn't have so much, but could have won it
[13879.16 - 13883.16] P:1830.28 E:0.101681 |  with a plan that is frustrating, I guess, with the quality you have.
[13883.16 - 13885.16] P:1870.69 E:0.104436 |  But that's taken you this far.
[13885.16 - 13889.16] P:1823.58 E:0.099518 |  It's the next step that perhaps you have to start looking,
[13889.16 - 13892.16] P:1865.63 E:0.100494 |  should we just play better, should we do things better,
[13892.16 - 13894.16] P:1875.20 E:0.101040 |  should we dominate, should we keep the ball?
[13894.16 - 13899.16] P:1862.43 E:0.098787 |  What happened, and again, we've been in this situation throughout the tournament,
[13899.16 - 13902.16] P:1780.23 E:0.111001 |  and there'll be a lot deeper analysis over coming days.
[13902.16 - 13906.16] P:1798.66 E:0.109150 |  But just in the immediate aftermath of the game, Izzy,
[13906.16 - 13908.16] P:1694.78 E:0.113267 |  I'll start with you down there,
[13908.16 - 13912.16] P:1841.32 E:0.102412 |  is that both times they went behind England,
[13912.16 - 13916.16] P:1862.81 E:0.106893 |  they then suddenly looked more urgent and created chances.
[13916.16 - 13919.16] P:1815.74 E:0.095178 |  When they were level, that didn't really...
[13919.16 - 13922.16] P:1729.98 E:0.112157 |  or you didn't feel like that really happened.
[13922.16 - 13927.16] P:1877.28 E:0.104276 |  Yeah, I did think that when England got back into the game,
[13927.16 - 13929.16] P:1872.85 E:0.099834 |  I thought there could be only one winner here,
[13929.16 - 13932.16] P:1845.54 E:0.096564 |  because you could feel the atmosphere,
[13932.16 - 13937.16] P:1756.95 E:0.109592 |  you could see the zip and the extra bit that the England players were putting into it,
[13937.16 - 13939.16] P:1786.67 E:0.106979 |  and you thought there's only going to be one winner here,
[13939.16 - 13943.16] P:1793.41 E:0.109313 |  but Spain, again, just mentioned there, the resilience,
[13943.16 - 13945.16] P:1740.07 E:0.106004 |  the layers to their team culture,
[13945.16 - 13947.16] P:1785.54 E:0.101475 |  is that they just rode out that pressure
[13947.16 - 13949.16] P:1782.95 E:0.113716 |  and just sucked the enthusiasm away from England
[13949.16 - 13951.16] P:1801.47 E:0.094271 |  and just went back at them,
[13951.16 - 13953.16] P:1931.55 E:0.095004 |  and the best form of defence's attack
[13953.16 - 13957.16] P:1894.75 E:0.105610 |  and the way that Spain just caught us open at times
[13957.16 - 13959.16] P:1784.36 E:0.103393 |  was you've got to hold your hands up and say,
[13959.16 - 13962.16] P:1849.49 E:0.089423 |  it's fantastic football.
[13962.16 - 13966.16] P:1881.85 E:0.108018 |  The Spanish team in this tournament,
[13966.16 - 13969.16] P:1895.75 E:0.111402 |  they have just been so superior,
[13969.16 - 13971.16] P:1783.09 E:0.104582 |  and you are right, that does happen a lot in football,
[13971.16 - 13973.16] P:1746.10 E:0.108827 |  doesn't it, when a team takes the lead
[13973.16 - 13976.16] P:1777.23 E:0.112998 |  and then another team will actually start having a go,
[13976.16 - 13978.16] P:1803.39 E:0.102603 |  and that's exactly the correct question,
[13978.16 - 13980.16] P:1885.73 E:0.111373 |  why actually is that?
[13980.16 - 13982.16] P:1791.26 E:0.096620 |  Well, they have to be braver,
[13982.16 - 13987.16] P:1907.11 E:0.110426 |  but the issue was, is England weren't brave enough on the evening
[13987.16 - 13989.16] P:1902.70 E:0.100713 |  to make that next step?
[13989.16 - 13993.16] P:1941.64 E:0.111535 |  And in this tournament, actually, it's not a bad thing.
[13993.16 - 13995.16] P:1828.86 E:0.106390 |  In fact, it's a really good thing for football
[13995.16 - 13997.16] P:1797.47 E:0.104613 |  because Spain won the tournament,
[13997.16 - 13999.16] P:1813.18 E:0.111557 |  playing the brand of football which they played,
[13999.16 - 14001.16] P:1746.93 E:0.111426 |  because let's get it right,
[14001.16 - 14003.16] P:1866.46 E:0.106465 |  had England got over the line tonight,
[14003.16 - 14006.16] P:1768.83 E:0.106581 |  it would have been all about the way that England defended,
[14006.16 - 14008.16] P:1874.62 E:0.096876 |  they tried to stifle Spain.
[14008.16 - 14010.16] P:1728.48 E:0.108854 |  Spain played the beautiful game,
[14010.16 - 14012.16] P:1810.22 E:0.104626 |  England didn't, but the beauty of Gareth's team
[14012.16 - 14014.16] P:1823.94 E:0.100891 |  this tournament has been getting over the line,
[14014.16 - 14017.16] P:1842.03 E:0.104328 |  but tonight you have to look at it and think,
[14017.16 - 14020.16] P:1939.08 E:0.100270 |  well, you know, for England to get to the next level,
[14020.16 - 14022.16] P:1869.32 E:0.110515 |  have they got the players who can do that?
[14022.16 - 14024.16] P:1971.05 E:0.104286 |  I believe that they have,
[14024.16 - 14027.16] P:1939.82 E:0.111083 |  England have been lopsided in this tournament
[14027.16 - 14032.16] P:1947.55 E:0.106557 |  and there's been anodity about the way they've tried to get up the pitch
[14032.16 - 14034.16] P:1971.21 E:0.112041 |  or, you know, up the field.
[14034.16 - 14036.16] P:1885.56 E:0.106813 |  Harry Kane didn't offer enough tonight,
[14036.16 - 14039.16] P:1961.76 E:0.105850 |  didn't make those movements in behind.
[14039.16 - 14041.16] P:1978.83 E:0.113418 |  Oli Watkins, when he came on,
[14041.16 - 14044.16] P:1941.08 E:0.115770 |  I actually felt all bit England was still doing a lot of defending
[14044.16 - 14046.16] P:1955.50 E:0.108590 |  that he was a better option
[14046.16 - 14048.16] P:1842.77 E:0.116455 |  and it wouldn't have been a surprise
[14048.16 - 14050.16] P:1916.17 E:0.110274 |  had he got in behind the Spanish back lines.
[14050.16 - 14052.16] P:1908.98 E:0.114951 |  But look, there's a lot to think about,
[14052.16 - 14054.16] P:1959.83 E:0.113091 |  there's a lot to digest.
[14054.16 - 14057.16] P:1970.81 E:0.109322 |  I think overall it's been a good tournament for Gareth Southgate,
[14057.16 - 14059.16] P:1938.31 E:0.110456 |  but just come up short once again.
[14059.16 - 14061.16] P:1962.03 E:0.105690 |  Well, I think, you know,
[14061.16 - 14063.16] P:1892.01 E:0.118923 |  Gareth made that change relatively early, didn't he,
[14063.16 - 14065.16] P:1918.89 E:0.114473 |  Kane, of Watkins on.
[14065.16 - 14069.16] P:1879.51 E:0.116770 |  And, yeah, I mean, he's not been at his sharpest this tournament,
[14069.16 - 14071.16] P:1895.19 E:0.105099 |  Harry Kane, he's still been, you know,
[14071.16 - 14073.16] P:1964.88 E:0.115434 |  effective in front of goal when he's had the chance,
[14073.16 - 14076.16] P:2018.22 E:0.094991 |  but I just feel that it, you know,
[14076.16 - 14079.16] P:1963.56 E:0.113220 |  does it hurt more when you lose playing like that
[14079.16 - 14082.16] P:2009.42 E:0.107946 |  than if you'd have lost playing like Spain.
[14082.16 - 14084.16] P:1954.23 E:0.116190 |  It's a different feeling.
[14084.16 - 14088.16] P:1839.61 E:0.111821 |  When you lose with the quality of player that England have
[14088.16 - 14091.16] P:1916.58 E:0.118109 |  in a game where we try to grind it all the time,
[14091.16 - 14093.16] P:1912.95 E:0.118257 |  it's a different feeling.
[14093.16 - 14095.16] P:1912.66 E:0.123441 |  You know, it's always a wonder of what if,
[14095.16 - 14098.16] P:1969.06 E:0.114670 |  could we play, could we be more expansive like that,
[14098.16 - 14100.16] P:1886.65 E:0.124317 |  and then you lose in a manner
[14100.16 - 14102.16] P:1956.96 E:0.114762 |  where you feel like you've thrown everything at it.
[14102.16 - 14104.16] P:1914.21 E:0.108814 |  And I think the players have done that
[14104.16 - 14107.16] P:1883.26 E:0.124751 |  in the way that we've played the whole tournament,
[14107.16 - 14109.16] P:1918.47 E:0.113938 |  but it's not that football that Chris is talking about,
[14109.16 - 14112.16] P:1951.23 E:0.120598 |  the way that you kind of really take it to another team
[14112.16 - 14113.16] P:1868.25 E:0.117644 |  with the ball.
[14113.16 - 14116.16] P:1965.00 E:0.117079 |  Just do it, try and give you some kind of picture
[14116.16 - 14120.16] P:1931.19 E:0.116880 |  of what's going on at the moment down there.
[14120.16 - 14124.16] P:1884.38 E:0.116772 |  They brought a stage on in a variety of different parts,
[14124.16 - 14127.16] P:1848.41 E:0.115427 |  and then assembled it on the pitch.
[14127.16 - 14130.16] P:1862.05 E:0.115791 |  They then think they've built it in slightly the wrong place.
[14130.16 - 14132.16] P:1892.89 E:0.115854 |  So they had a whole load of volunteers
[14132.16 - 14134.16] P:1837.57 E:0.114244 |  in Bomba-Builder, the Ella Hardhat,
[14134.16 - 14137.16] P:1885.28 E:0.112362 |  who then tried to push the stage,
[14137.16 - 14139.16] P:1774.16 E:0.118587 |  maybe three yards to the left,
[14139.16 - 14141.16] P:1819.88 E:0.120859 |  and have failed in doing that.
[14141.16 - 14143.16] P:1866.91 E:0.114792 |  And so at the end of trying to shift it,
[14143.16 - 14146.16] P:1823.27 E:0.121780 |  they've decided, stop it, we're going to leave it where it is,
[14146.16 - 14149.16] P:1787.49 E:0.115269 |  and we'll run off and we'll get on with the ceremony.
[14149.16 - 14151.16] P:1789.37 E:0.120735 |  Whilst let me make the right picks here of that,
[14151.16 - 14155.16] P:1698.91 E:0.113082 |  Izzy has been watching the various ways
[14155.16 - 14157.16] P:1654.53 E:0.121958 |  the England players are consoling each other
[14157.16 - 14159.16] P:1732.28 E:0.113642 |  on the far side of the field.
[14159.16 - 14161.16] P:1704.25 E:0.121577 |  Yeah, we've got Bellingham, well,
[14161.16 - 14163.16] P:1736.82 E:0.122755 |  he was just sat on the grass on his own,
[14163.16 - 14166.16] P:1814.88 E:0.114202 |  John Stones doing the same, having a moment to themselves,
[14166.16 - 14168.16] P:1894.34 E:0.104271 |  and Harry Kane went over to Jude Bellingham
[14168.16 - 14171.16] P:1999.66 E:0.108087 |  and consoled him for quite a long length of time.
[14171.16 - 14173.16] P:2053.85 E:0.102407 |  But you can just see here the players,
[14173.16 - 14176.16] P:2027.61 E:0.111977 |  they are understandably so dejected,
[14176.16 - 14179.16] P:2019.78 E:0.103945 |  and I do think that they gave everything.
[14179.16 - 14181.16] P:1784.78 E:0.110437 |  Yeah, of course, we'll pick it to pieces later
[14181.16 - 14184.16] P:1805.43 E:0.115731 |  and think about what and discuss what they could have done better,
[14184.16 - 14187.16] P:1880.15 E:0.111471 |  but I thought Gower Southgate was brave with the substitutions,
[14187.16 - 14189.16] P:1764.12 E:0.116641 |  and Jude Bellingham's just right in front of me right now,
[14189.16 - 14192.16] P:1811.21 E:0.113680 |  just applauding the fans, and they're giving it back to him.
[14192.16 - 14196.16] P:1820.09 E:0.111063 |  And I'm sure he's got many, many more finals ahead of him.
[14196.16 - 14199.16] P:1837.55 E:0.115890 |  And is Gower Southgate in the middle of that?
[14199.16 - 14201.16] P:1872.44 E:0.106110 |  I seem to have lost him at the moment.
[14201.16 - 14204.16] P:1873.66 E:0.109707 |  He was doing it, oh, hang on, John, yes, sorry.
[14204.16 - 14206.16] P:1975.43 E:0.118368 |  Yeah, you know, he's just come over to do it
[14206.16 - 14208.16] P:2002.09 E:0.109919 |  the first of his interviews down pitchside,
[14208.16 - 14212.16] P:2002.66 E:0.104889 |  so he's just about 15 yards from the halfway line
[14212.16 - 14214.16] P:1848.25 E:0.114382 |  behind one of those boards.
[14214.16 - 14217.16] P:1927.24 E:0.107172 |  OK, and so he'll be doing that,
[14217.16 - 14221.16] P:1784.19 E:0.104216 |  and we will bring you some reaction.
[14221.16 - 14226.16] P:1884.66 E:0.107590 |  I would say maybe two-thirds of the England fans at the moment
[14226.16 - 14227.16] P:1879.52 E:0.119491 |  have stayed behind.
[14227.16 - 14229.16] P:1932.52 E:0.106721 |  There are quite large swathes of graces,
[14229.16 - 14233.16] P:1943.72 E:0.106828 |  but plenty have stayed for this trophy presentation.
[14233.16 - 14238.16] P:1919.76 E:0.109196 |  The Spanish fans understandably, to our right, bouncing up and down.
[14238.16 - 14244.16] P:1955.32 E:0.109560 |  I mean, the thing was, Spain probably created more chances
[14244.16 - 14247.16] P:1672.90 E:0.125032 |  at one all, really,
[14247.16 - 14249.16] P:1834.34 E:0.118885 |  and it felt like in that last 50-20 minutes
[14249.16 - 14251.16] P:1771.96 E:0.119197 |  than they had in the rest of the game.
[14251.16 - 14254.16] P:1849.17 E:0.120061 |  I still stick to my idea that the first half of England
[14254.16 - 14257.16] P:1907.96 E:0.113590 |  was what they tried to do and stopped us,
[14257.16 - 14260.16] P:1860.30 E:0.113543 |  especially the wingers, having an impact.
[14260.16 - 14263.16] P:1800.53 E:0.120663 |  And the first action that a winger beats a defender
[14263.16 - 14265.16] P:1838.07 E:0.114540 |  in the second half is a goal.
[14265.16 - 14268.16] P:1906.28 E:0.097412 |  And after that, more chances happened.
[14268.16 - 14270.16] P:1929.54 E:0.114727 |  That was the moment to actually kill the game,
[14270.16 - 14272.16] P:1784.48 E:0.106252 |  and we don't do that. We don't kill the end,
[14272.16 - 14274.16] P:2026.93 E:0.100792 |  and Pickford was good.
[14274.16 - 14277.16] P:1952.99 E:0.107697 |  And then when we conceded, which was against the odds,
[14277.16 - 14279.16] P:1991.01 E:0.111303 |  but that's England, isn't it? Just one moment.
[14279.16 - 14281.16] P:1968.37 E:0.122390 |  The moment appeared.
[14281.16 - 14284.16] P:1953.65 E:0.114392 |  I thought, well, that's it.
[14284.16 - 14286.16] P:1927.38 E:0.114222 |  Extra time. Look at them. They tied.
[14286.16 - 14288.16] P:1873.71 E:0.116447 |  And yet they surprised me again.
[14288.16 - 14290.16] P:1869.93 E:0.120017 |  Like, they'd done in the whole tournament.
[14290.16 - 14292.16] P:1977.38 E:0.107691 |  They were like, no, no, we're going at it.
[14292.16 - 14295.16] P:1935.66 E:0.113457 |  Without fear, brave, courageous,
[14295.16 - 14297.16] P:1960.93 E:0.115391 |  that's what was won in the tournament.
[14297.16 - 14300.16] P:1867.19 E:0.118880 |  They've given Nico Williams the player of the match here, Chris.
[14300.16 - 14304.16] P:1846.79 E:0.114465 |  Although what was also quite interesting in that last 50 minutes
[14304.16 - 14306.16] P:1807.60 E:0.121017 |  was once Morata was...
[14306.16 - 14307.16] P:1738.37 E:0.114938 |  I thought Morata was great.
[14307.16 - 14309.16] P:1839.66 E:0.109185 |  Once Morata was taken off,
[14309.16 - 14312.16] P:1767.84 E:0.116144 |  they used Nico Williams centrally every now and then,
[14312.16 - 14314.16] P:1782.64 E:0.101176 |  and that just changed that dynamic a bit.
[14314.16 - 14317.16] P:1616.43 E:0.118611 |  Yeah, I mean, in the second half,
[14317.16 - 14321.16] P:1637.88 E:0.119922 |  I think both him and Yamal off the other side
[14321.16 - 14324.16] P:1658.30 E:0.118837 |  played narrower at times,
[14324.16 - 14326.16] P:1803.06 E:0.121460 |  brilliant the way they both linked up.
[14326.16 - 14329.16] P:1744.43 E:0.114109 |  And actually, fair play to them for being courageous,
[14329.16 - 14332.16] P:1699.17 E:0.116081 |  the wide players, because they both were really quiet
[14332.16 - 14335.16] P:1729.47 E:0.116365 |  in the first half, but they have this belief
[14335.16 - 14337.16] P:1768.88 E:0.105073 |  and the confidence.
[14337.16 - 14340.16] P:1768.32 E:0.114633 |  I'm not so sure he would have been my player of the match,
[14340.16 - 14342.16] P:1783.63 E:0.112893 |  but he was mightly effective.
[14342.16 - 14345.16] P:1714.61 E:0.109298 |  I think he would be my player of the tournament overall.
[14345.16 - 14348.16] P:1778.58 E:0.103529 |  Do you know we've talked about the flexibility of the Spanish players?
[14348.16 - 14350.16] P:1657.23 E:0.116041 |  They realised that they couldn't beat the full-backs.
[14350.16 - 14353.16] P:1823.66 E:0.114154 |  So what you got was La Mina and Nico coming inside.
[14353.16 - 14356.16] P:1945.74 E:0.098288 |  And sometimes, like, no, I tell you what,
[14356.16 - 14359.16] P:1871.49 E:0.113587 |  the two of us are going to join the full-back in one of the wings.
[14359.16 - 14363.16] P:1660.37 E:0.125575 |  So they kept trying different ways to see which way worked,
[14363.16 - 14366.16] P:1818.58 E:0.112143 |  and sometimes players are too fixated in their position,
[14366.16 - 14368.16] P:1854.98 E:0.107900 |  in their obligations, not them too.
[14368.16 - 14371.16] P:1825.31 E:0.109433 |  Because with the goal, Carvajal nicks it round the corner,
[14371.16 - 14374.16] P:1781.98 E:0.112360 |  and he's inside of Luxuor already to have the pass,
[14374.16 - 14376.16] P:1864.27 E:0.112820 |  so he's already come inside.
[14376.16 - 14379.16] P:1767.64 E:0.109827 |  I think Luxuor quite knows where he is.
[14379.16 - 14382.16] P:1889.70 E:0.101158 |  It was a fantastic touch, but Spanish subs come on,
[14382.16 - 14384.16] P:1799.53 E:0.111421 |  and you see more of the same.
[14384.16 - 14386.16] P:1716.74 E:0.095938 |  It's the system, it's the method.
[14386.16 - 14389.16] P:1745.66 E:0.101298 |  We want an England player to come on to change it,
[14389.16 - 14392.16] P:1647.55 E:0.108125 |  and I think that, for me, speaks a lot about the two teams,
[14392.16 - 14396.16] P:1747.10 E:0.113058 |  that is well, kind of, you know, entrenched in how they're going to go about things,
[14396.16 - 14400.16] P:1755.29 E:0.115641 |  and the England team that are looking for that one-off piece of magic to change the game.
[14400.16 - 14404.16] P:1629.11 E:0.122949 |  Józef Killini is now bringing that trophy back out.
[14404.16 - 14406.16] P:1453.37 E:0.124571 |  Remember, he brought it out of the start of the match,
[14406.16 - 14409.16] P:1484.17 E:0.125100 |  had both sets of ribbons on it, hard-breakingly for England,
[14409.16 - 14413.16] P:1798.31 E:0.114868 |  as he carries it onto the plinth on the stage.
[14413.16 - 14416.16] P:1650.03 E:0.118635 |  It just has the Spanish colours on it.
[14416.16 - 14419.16] P:1740.89 E:0.117628 |  The Spanish team have formed a guard of honour,
[14419.16 - 14422.16] P:1648.27 E:0.117567 |  waited for England to go and pick up their runners-up medals.
[14422.16 - 14426.16] P:1636.37 E:0.119791 |  The Spanish backroom staff, who stay behind a ribbon game,
[14426.16 - 14430.16] P:1754.78 E:0.095272 |  have all put on Spanish home shirts with the number four on the back.
[14430.16 - 14436.16] P:1722.81 E:0.108961 |  Yeah, Luz de la Fuente always insists with the idea that at the end of the game
[14436.16 - 14439.16] P:1708.45 E:0.115655 |  there's a photo of everyone in the changing room,
[14439.16 - 14441.16] P:1816.97 E:0.123941 |  and number four is the amount of times
[14441.16 - 14445.16] P:1899.61 E:0.115041 |  who won the European Championships, like not the nation in Europe.
[14445.16 - 14448.16] P:1848.66 E:0.115262 |  They are going to start the presentation.
[14448.16 - 14452.16] P:1770.36 E:0.110247 |  They start with the young player of the tournament,
[14452.16 - 14457.16] P:1672.19 E:0.110358 |  which is probably not surprising that it goes to La Mena Malmatoxen.
[14457.16 - 14459.16] P:1724.40 E:0.097867 |  Not a shock, is it? Let's face it.
[14459.16 - 14463.16] P:1620.08 E:0.107945 |  I mean, you know, what a tournament.
[14463.16 - 14466.16] P:1865.50 E:0.105469 |  What a burst onto the scene for a young man.
[14466.16 - 14468.16] P:1911.16 E:0.099162 |  One goal and four assists, isn't it?
[14468.16 - 14471.16] P:1732.05 E:0.112723 |  Incredible, incredible. What a player and no fans.
[14471.16 - 14475.16] P:1876.94 E:0.104035 |  That goal being one-off, if not the goal of the tournament.
[14475.16 - 14477.16] P:2003.66 E:0.109602 |  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it was a super-strike,
[14477.16 - 14479.16] P:1994.57 E:0.110802 |  and you know, completely...
[14479.16 - 14483.16] P:1932.86 E:0.107680 |  It's just such a slam dunk in that this young man is the young player of the tournament.
[14483.16 - 14488.16] P:1830.12 E:0.110934 |  So La Mena Mal walks off back down the Guard of Honor
[14488.16 - 14492.16] P:1849.11 E:0.115960 |  with the young player of the tournament,
[14492.16 - 14496.16] P:1812.31 E:0.118258 |  and now they are giving the player of the tournament,
[14496.16 - 14500.16] P:1932.55 E:0.108122 |  which... Why are you rolling your eyes, Chris?
[14500.16 - 14502.16] P:1909.64 E:0.117846 |  Well, I mean, it's Rodrey, isn't it?
[14502.16 - 14505.16] P:1865.69 E:0.121681 |  He's been quite good, not as good as Nico Williams,
[14505.16 - 14507.16] P:1750.05 E:0.118734 |  but he didn't play the second half, so I don't think he's...
[14507.16 - 14509.16] P:1734.94 E:0.117292 |  Well, he's played with the tournament, not the match.
[14509.16 - 14511.16] P:1875.77 E:0.111975 |  Yeah, I know, but you've got to be...
[14511.16 - 14513.16] P:1785.87 E:0.120405 |  You've got to see it around the final, haven't you?
[14513.16 - 14516.16] P:1733.32 E:0.112862 |  OK, let's talk to somebody who's not miffed the day
[14516.16 - 14519.16] P:1675.31 E:0.122534 |  gave it to Nico Williams 30 seconds before he's announced to Rodrey.
[14519.16 - 14522.16] P:1818.95 E:0.108945 |  You have to say he's, he does, fully deserved.
[14522.16 - 14524.16] P:1768.35 E:0.106255 |  Rodrey? Yeah.
[14524.16 - 14527.16] P:1775.93 E:0.100535 |  Oh, yeah, yeah. I don't know why Chris has rolled in his eyes.
[14527.16 - 14530.16] P:1635.12 E:0.107519 |  It's not like Chris to do something like that.
[14530.16 - 14533.16] P:1845.55 E:0.110715 |  But no, I think... I think he's been exceptional.
[14533.16 - 14536.16] P:1854.60 E:0.120636 |  And we spoke a half-time, didn't we? His absence in the second half
[14536.16 - 14539.16] P:1853.56 E:0.116558 |  would be a real advantage for England. Absolutely not.
[14539.16 - 14541.16] P:1868.43 E:0.106913 |  And it just goes to show the depth in that team
[14541.16 - 14543.16] P:1779.87 E:0.107025 |  and the trust that Delafuente has in the team
[14543.16 - 14545.16] P:1726.70 E:0.112520 |  and what he can bring on and affect the game.
[14545.16 - 14547.16] P:1691.16 E:0.109516 |  But Rodrey, across the whole tournament,
[14547.16 - 14549.16] P:1783.92 E:0.110246 |  he's been absolutely sublime to watch.
[14549.16 - 14553.16] P:1820.62 E:0.109026 |  Back to the point, you bring the sub on, doesn't change.
[14553.16 - 14555.16] P:1737.30 E:0.113336 |  No. Doesn't change the system. We still go.
[14555.16 - 14557.16] P:1767.27 E:0.106734 |  He was excellent, wasn't he?
[14557.16 - 14559.16] P:1727.26 E:0.106524 |  Excellent, and all over the pitch they do that.
[14559.16 - 14561.16] P:1815.85 E:0.107652 |  We bring on a sub, we want them to change it.
[14561.16 - 14564.16] P:1729.21 E:0.107433 |  We want something different, magical to happen.
[14564.16 - 14569.16] P:1950.85 E:0.103938 |  And, you know, it's hard to play against that kind of machine that Spain are.
[14569.16 - 14571.16] P:1800.98 E:0.118952 |  We've moved on from young player of the tournament
[14571.16 - 14573.16] P:1692.03 E:0.102633 |  to player of the tournament.
[14573.16 - 14575.16] P:1728.65 E:0.111926 |  Go through the guard of honour.
[14575.16 - 14577.16] P:1741.05 E:0.110967 |  Next are the officials.
[14577.16 - 14579.16] P:1698.63 E:0.109641 |  You get a smattering of booze.
[14579.16 - 14582.16] P:1708.74 E:0.102250 |  They necessarily didn't really do anything wrong.
[14582.16 - 14584.16] P:1511.86 E:0.111941 |  Did they jump worry in that game?
[14584.16 - 14586.16] P:1623.87 E:0.111392 |  Not really comes to mind.
[14586.16 - 14588.16] P:1898.08 E:0.115838 |  No, I thought he handled it well.
[14588.16 - 14590.16] P:1822.83 E:0.100783 |  I'm going to refer to the final.
[14590.16 - 14592.16] P:1588.29 E:0.101659 |  Francois, the taxier,
[14592.16 - 14595.16] P:1825.64 E:0.110088 |  and he's just receiving his medal.
[14595.16 - 14601.16] P:1822.81 E:0.109468 |  And they're having a good chat, aren't they, with Alexander Chetley?
[14601.16 - 14604.16] P:1801.67 E:0.115048 |  That's rather dull, so let's go back to it.
[14604.16 - 14608.16] P:1696.59 E:0.114805 |  I think when you actually look at the line of where Inglada are,
[14608.16 - 14611.16] P:1641.31 E:0.112875 |  and you've got Steve Holland, Garisavka,
[14611.16 - 14613.16] P:1765.01 E:0.117139 |  and Harry Kane all next to each other.
[14613.16 - 14616.16] P:1629.74 E:0.123446 |  And actually, Harry Kane now with his hands on his head.
[14616.16 - 14619.16] P:1882.66 E:0.112245 |  For a long time, he was just pinching the bridge of his nose
[14619.16 - 14621.16] P:1710.76 E:0.119885 |  at his eyes and looking at the floor.
[14621.16 - 14624.16] P:1802.52 E:0.111120 |  He must be absolutely heartbroken down there.
[14624.16 - 14626.16] P:1779.19 E:0.101407 |  Yeah, it's absolutely horrible.
[14626.16 - 14628.16] P:1827.51 E:0.127847 |  The body language of all the England players,
[14628.16 - 14632.16] P:1767.59 E:0.111788 |  dejected, Covi Maynou just stood on his own leaning against the post.
[14632.16 - 14634.16] P:1841.60 E:0.109640 |  Just having a little moment to himself,
[14634.16 - 14637.16] P:1857.00 E:0.113598 |  Declan Rice on the floor looking extremely dejected.
[14637.16 - 14642.16] P:1866.22 E:0.115637 |  Can't even look at what's going on with the Spanish celebrations.
[14642.16 - 14646.16] P:1755.90 E:0.111050 |  It really is probably the worst feeling ever.
[14646.16 - 14649.16] P:1814.06 E:0.118169 |  Yeah, and Jude Bellingham over on the far side,
[14649.16 - 14651.16] P:1851.22 E:0.114157 |  well, at the penalty area, really,
[14651.16 - 14653.16] P:1839.53 E:0.122646 |  and he's had his back to it all
[14653.16 - 14656.16] P:1883.89 E:0.116002 |  and looked at the fans over on the far side,
[14656.16 - 14659.16] P:1849.46 E:0.113910 |  and he now joins the back of this group.
[14659.16 - 14661.16] P:1831.79 E:0.120514 |  Harry Kane is leading them,
[14661.16 - 14666.16] P:1847.41 E:0.119849 |  but Bellingham and Maynou stood alone with their thoughts, really,
[14666.16 - 14669.16] P:1903.37 E:0.111029 |  at the last two at the back of that line,
[14669.16 - 14672.16] P:1816.37 E:0.114768 |  and the backroom staff applaud the England players.
[14672.16 - 14674.16] P:1774.30 E:0.117347 |  He and Dennis has to do the Spanish players
[14674.16 - 14677.16] P:1786.91 E:0.112961 |  as they walk up to get their runners-up medals
[14677.16 - 14679.16] P:1842.66 E:0.108316 |  and have to trudge past that trophy,
[14679.16 - 14681.16] P:1819.43 E:0.117389 |  as Harry Kane just gives it a little look
[14681.16 - 14684.16] P:1805.91 E:0.111120 |  and then deep breath and hangs his head back
[14684.16 - 14687.16] P:1567.14 E:0.110219 |  as he heads to the steps to take him off the stage.
[14687.16 - 14689.16] P:1897.48 E:0.118237 |  Well, when we were speaking here yesterday
[14689.16 - 14690.16] P:1858.27 E:0.114166 |  and I said, what an achievement,
[14690.16 - 14694.16] P:1944.95 E:0.109977 |  you're going to be the first man to captain England in two finals.
[14694.16 - 14697.16] P:1902.32 E:0.109265 |  And he said, yeah, but I don't want to be remembered
[14697.16 - 14699.16] P:1949.34 E:0.109047 |  as the first captain to lose two finals,
[14699.16 - 14701.16] P:1902.13 E:0.104489 |  which is exactly the case.
[14701.16 - 14703.16] P:1860.79 E:0.109837 |  And also, Jude Bellingham,
[14703.16 - 14705.16] P:1782.44 E:0.110189 |  I don't know if you watched it,
[14705.16 - 14708.16] P:1828.87 E:0.098600 |  as they're applauded by their entire backroom staff down below,
[14708.16 - 14710.16] P:1685.97 E:0.109258 |  but just after the final whistle,
[14710.16 - 14713.16] P:1811.26 E:0.103297 |  Jude Bellingham was the first England player to come off the pitch
[14713.16 - 14717.16] P:1813.26 E:0.097579 |  and he kicked one of the blue drinks buckets
[14717.16 - 14721.16] P:1789.26 E:0.108558 |  in anger as he then sat in the dugout,
[14721.16 - 14725.16] P:1815.73 E:0.105031 |  and they will be hurting yet again
[14726.16 - 14728.16] P:1786.72 E:0.124330 |  after the disappointment at Wembley from three years ago
[14728.16 - 14733.16] P:1908.07 E:0.108319 |  to lose the first nation to lose back-to-back Eurofinals.
[14734.16 - 14738.16] P:1789.50 E:0.115097 |  And they've come now into a little roped-off area,
[14738.16 - 14743.16] P:1697.94 E:0.111872 |  and the England backroom staff continue to applaud
[14743.16 - 14748.16] P:1780.15 E:0.105386 |  as the final few players come past to get their runners-up medals,
[14748.16 - 14752.16] P:1697.64 E:0.101675 |  Maynou, and then Bellingham, and then Walker,
[14752.16 - 14754.16] P:1765.17 E:0.116268 |  who was probably England's best player this evening,
[14754.16 - 14756.16] P:1688.61 E:0.103605 |  and then finally, Garisavgate,
[14756.16 - 14759.16] P:1759.98 E:0.105094 |  who gets a consoling pat on the back,
[14759.16 - 14765.16] P:1774.31 E:0.108062 |  and then a hug from Alexander Seferin of UEFA before he gets that medal,
[14765.16 - 14768.16] P:1771.93 E:0.114842 |  and he doesn't look at the trophy, doesn't sound Garisavgate,
[14768.16 - 14771.16] P:1809.99 E:0.106546 |  as he walks off the stage,
[14771.16 - 14775.16] P:1822.57 E:0.098962 |  and England will now stand in that little roped-off area,
[14775.16 - 14780.16] P:1791.81 E:0.115529 |  and they will go through the painful routine of watching the victors
[14780.16 - 14784.16] P:1789.13 E:0.112365 |  pick up this trophy described by John Murray.
[14785.16 - 14789.16] P:1897.00 E:0.115946 |  The Spanish fans lost two tiers to our right.
[14789.16 - 14794.16] P:1859.59 E:0.105949 |  The flags are waving, the famous yellow and red flags of Spain
[14794.16 - 14799.16] P:1678.89 E:0.115906 |  are dotted all around that section of this huge Olympic Stadium here in Berlin,
[14799.16 - 14805.16] P:1671.49 E:0.112005 |  with the floodlights shining down, and it is the coach, Luis de la Fuente,
[14805.16 - 14809.16] P:1741.00 E:0.109713 |  the 63-year-old coach.
[14809.16 - 14812.16] P:1741.37 E:0.112812 |  Don't be fooled by his trendy shoes,
[14812.16 - 14817.16] P:1671.54 E:0.121428 |  but what a job that he's done winning trophies with the young teams,
[14817.16 - 14821.16] P:1692.05 E:0.118444 |  the young Spanish teams, and now he's done it at senior level,
[14821.16 - 14826.16] P:1800.54 E:0.113564 |  the third oldest coach in a European Championship final,
[14826.16 - 14830.16] P:1849.64 E:0.119616 |  and the two who were older than him also won it as well,
[14830.16 - 14833.16] P:1656.22 E:0.109875 |  Luis Aragonés, one of his predecessors,
[14833.16 - 14838.16] P:1715.49 E:0.110223 |  and Otto Reihagel of Greece, so Luis de la Fuente,
[14838.16 - 14843.16] P:1796.72 E:0.109286 |  just the Justices Spectacles, the fourth man to lead Spain
[14843.16 - 14848.16] P:1853.41 E:0.113034 |  to victory at the European Championship after José Villalonga,
[14848.16 - 14853.16] P:1733.08 E:0.120620 |  I mentioned Luis Aragonés, and Vicente Del Bosque as well.
[14853.16 - 14857.16] P:1755.57 E:0.117894 |  He's the coach, now the players are receiving their medals as well.
[14857.16 - 14860.16] P:1770.86 E:0.123613 |  Alexander Cephrine, the king of Spain is there, isn't he, Guillem?
[14860.16 - 14865.16] P:1727.40 E:0.118333 |  The king of Spain, King Felipe is part of the presentation party.
[14865.16 - 14869.16] P:1677.61 E:0.123889 |  Big fan, who's an Alético Madrid, big football fan,
[14869.16 - 14872.16] P:1710.71 E:0.116350 |  who's an Alético Madrid supporter, so he'll be happy for Borata.
[14872.16 - 14875.16] P:1827.36 E:0.125572 |  Gave a really big call to Luis de la Fuente,
[14875.16 - 14880.16] P:1918.94 E:0.109999 |  and it is a time to celebrate, because it's not just a team that has played,
[14880.16 - 14886.16] P:1873.48 E:0.117735 |  as you say, the right way, it's done with La Mínia Mal,
[14886.16 - 14889.16] P:1787.78 E:0.118735 |  and Marco Williams being the face of the country,
[14889.16 - 14892.16] P:1761.52 E:0.116731 |  with the right values of solidarity,
[14892.16 - 14895.16] P:1533.75 E:0.104956 |  a manager that doesn't want their attention,
[14895.16 - 14901.16] P:1413.03 E:0.103255 |  and has taken national football level at a completely new height, I think.
[14901.16 - 14906.16] P:1472.49 E:0.109695 |  It's very difficult to see teams play this well the whole tournament.
[14906.16 - 14911.16] P:1566.52 E:0.112201 |  I remember in 2012, we were conservative in our approach with possession,
[14911.16 - 14913.16] P:1471.99 E:0.105001 |  but in the final, we beat Italy.
[14913.16 - 14915.16] P:1472.95 E:0.116439 |  We've done it from the beginning to the end,
[14915.16 - 14918.16] P:1414.57 E:0.113131 |  and we bet we beat everything that's put in front of us.
[14918.16 - 14919.16] P:1700.51 E:0.110862 |  Not easy to do.
[14919.16 - 14924.16] P:1738.45 E:0.122027 |  Guillem, I'm just seeing Jesus Navas receiving his medal, the 38-year-old,
[14924.16 - 14928.16] P:1634.40 E:0.116552 |  what a great moment for him, didn't get on here, but he'll retire in December.
[14928.16 - 14931.16] P:1719.96 E:0.124124 |  I'm thinking of the Real Madrid players down there as well,
[14931.16 - 14935.16] P:1756.27 E:0.113491 |  the Vunla League, the Champions League, and the European Championship.
[14935.16 - 14940.16] P:1823.56 E:0.113988 |  And so, Nacho and Carvajal and Hossalu, of course,
[14940.16 - 14943.16] P:1832.29 E:0.113316 |  but now it's the moment that the King of Spain, King Felipe,
[14943.16 - 14946.16] P:1822.14 E:0.114333 |  along with Alexander Chefering, hands Alvaro Morata,
[14946.16 - 14950.16] P:1748.22 E:0.107016 |  that chunky European Championship trophy,
[14950.16 - 14952.16] P:1728.43 E:0.114884 |  and Spain are about to hold it aloft.
[14952.16 - 14955.16] P:1898.29 E:0.108858 |  This is the team that won all seven matches.
[14955.16 - 14958.16] P:1705.65 E:0.120728 |  This is the team that were the team of the tournament,
[14958.16 - 14960.16] P:1801.23 E:0.119371 |  and they are European champions.
[14960.16 - 14966.16] P:1731.99 E:0.110775 |  Spain, four times now they've won it, the first team to win it four times.
[14966.16 - 14969.16] P:1677.86 E:0.121118 |  And what a run that they've had here with all of their victories
[14969.16 - 14974.16] P:1818.15 E:0.121922 |  as the fireworks go off on the roof of Berlin's Olympic Stadium,
[14974.16 - 14976.16] P:1853.75 E:0.121616 |  and the Golden Glitter comes down.
[14976.16 - 14980.16] P:1768.23 E:0.122157 |  Spain started out this tournament here in Berlin,
[14980.16 - 14983.16] P:1847.42 E:0.115513 |  with an opening victory against Croatia,
[14983.16 - 14986.16] P:1849.91 E:0.118782 |  and those wins kept coming.
[14986.16 - 14989.16] P:1827.77 E:0.120889 |  Italy, Albania in the group stage,
[14989.16 - 14993.16] P:1796.46 E:0.115467 |  in the knockout stage, Georgia, Germany, France,
[14993.16 - 14995.16] P:1547.24 E:0.125459 |  and then England in the final.
[14995.16 - 14997.16] P:1551.43 E:0.113709 |  Seven wins out of seven,
[14997.16 - 15000.16] P:1798.44 E:0.118101 |  and those Spanish players down there in the red shirts
[15000.16 - 15003.16] P:1902.85 E:0.107676 |  hand the trophy around and hold it aloft,
[15003.16 - 15007.16] P:1911.40 E:0.100171 |  and a huge cheer as Rodry lifted into the air.
[15007.16 - 15010.16] P:1834.08 E:0.104170 |  And there we have it, England stand to one side
[15010.16 - 15015.16] P:1698.39 E:0.089082 |  and watch the Spanish celebrations here in Berlin.
[15015.16 - 15021.16] P:1654.21 E:0.105754 |  And they do, and by the time the confetti finishes falling to the ground,
[15021.16 - 15024.16] P:1635.79 E:0.119808 |  all the England players are down the tunnel.
[15024.16 - 15029.16] P:1794.40 E:0.137192 |  They have already left the scene and left the pitch
[15029.16 - 15032.16] P:1737.58 E:0.130856 |  to their Spanish counterparts to celebrate,
[15032.16 - 15036.16] P:1842.45 E:0.120393 |  and watching them down in the tunnel is Gary Flintoff.
[15036.16 - 15041.16] P:1505.62 E:0.127790 |  As you can imagine, Mark, there isn't a single smile or semi-smile
[15041.16 - 15045.16] P:1543.91 E:0.119813 |  on any of the England players' faces as they make their way back
[15045.16 - 15049.16] P:1278.01 E:0.125055 |  towards the stairs of the escalator that you mentioned earlier in the programme.
[15049.16 - 15051.16] P:1458.48 E:0.117070 |  One or two have their heads bowed,
[15051.16 - 15054.16] P:1497.50 E:0.117843 |  but the majority of them just sort of stared ahead of them
[15054.16 - 15058.16] P:1294.61 E:0.113413 |  as they walked down the tunnel and took a right turn back towards the dressing rooms.
[15058.16 - 15060.16] P:1252.03 E:0.110210 |  And as has been the narrative really,
[15060.16 - 15063.16] P:1518.85 E:0.115474 |  an opportunity missed this evening may be,
[15063.16 - 15067.16] P:1057.37 E:0.112512 |  but ultimately they will know that they were beaten by the better side.
[15070.16 - 15073.16] P:1577.05 E:0.117461 |  OK, as we are the champions, rings out here.
[15073.16 - 15075.16] P:1791.97 E:0.108063 |  Let's hear from Harry Kane,
[15075.16 - 15078.16] P:1801.63 E:0.105842 |  who before he went up to pick up his medal,
[15078.16 - 15081.16] P:1514.58 E:0.095971 |  his runners-up medal, spied with Kelly Somers.
[15081.16 - 15086.16] P:1484.97 E:0.093784 |  Harry, commiserations given how that game played out, how much does that hurt?
[15086.16 - 15089.16] P:1402.37 E:0.098169 |  Yeah, I mean, losing in a final is as tough as it gets.
[15089.16 - 15093.16] P:1376.13 E:0.088767 |  I think we've done really well to get back into the game and get back to 1-1,
[15093.16 - 15098.16] P:1391.65 E:0.095224 |  and then we couldn't quite use that momentum to push on.
[15098.16 - 15102.16] P:1416.29 E:0.093794 |  We couldn't quite keep the ball, and then we got punished for it towards the end of the game,
[15102.16 - 15106.16] P:1213.55 E:0.086878 |  so, I mean, yeah, it's as painful as it could be in a football match.
[15106.16 - 15110.16] P:1260.10 E:0.092899 |  Why do you think you couldn't build on it when Cole did go back into it?
[15110.16 - 15113.16] P:1468.84 E:0.105566 |  Why do you think you couldn't build on it when Cole got you back into it?
[15113.16 - 15117.16] P:1487.62 E:0.091415 |  No, we didn't quite keep the same intensity and pressure, I guess.
[15117.16 - 15119.16] P:1503.83 E:0.086109 |  We didn't quite keep the ball well enough.
[15119.16 - 15121.16] P:1684.10 E:0.104883 |  You know, it's the last stage of the tournament,
[15121.16 - 15125.16] P:1388.72 E:0.089589 |  there's a lot of tired legs, there's a lot of tired mentality there,
[15125.16 - 15130.16] P:1483.24 E:0.086544 |  and yeah, we just struggled, and then obviously we got caught with the ball in behind.
[15130.16 - 15132.16] P:1556.28 E:0.097530 |  And then, yeah, you know, these are down to big moments.
[15132.16 - 15135.16] P:1597.61 E:0.098882 |  We had a big moment at the end there where they cleared one off the line,
[15135.16 - 15139.16] P:1497.42 E:0.088273 |  and it could have been different, but yeah, for now, it's just really disappointing.
[15139.16 - 15143.16] P:1329.47 E:0.093182 |  For you personally, how tough as a player and captain has this tournament been?
[15143.16 - 15145.16] P:1302.19 E:0.099141 |  You came off again tonight with England needing a goal.
[15145.16 - 15147.16] P:1501.39 E:0.086897 |  Yeah, no, it's been a tough tournament.
[15147.16 - 15151.16] P:1499.82 E:0.095867 |  We've had to show a lot of resilience, me personally, and the whole team as well.
[15151.16 - 15155.16] P:1496.29 E:0.099190 |  It's been a difficult ride, we've done it really well to get here,
[15155.16 - 15158.16] P:1410.25 E:0.092409 |  and ultimately we've got to be judged on this game.
[15158.16 - 15161.16] P:1533.99 E:0.103445 |  We wanted to do it so badly for ourselves, but also for the fans,
[15161.16 - 15164.16] P:1376.84 E:0.098245 |  and everyone who's believed in us the whole way.
[15164.16 - 15167.16] P:1383.86 E:0.084916 |  So right now it's just huge disappointment.
[15167.16 - 15170.16] P:1263.59 E:0.090812 |  Lots of talk about the manager's future and whether this could have been his last game.
[15170.16 - 15172.16] P:1166.91 E:0.101776 |  Do the players want him to stay on?
[15172.16 - 15175.16] P:1408.52 E:0.090757 |  Yeah, look, we made it clear we loved the manager, but that's his decision.
[15175.16 - 15177.16] P:1293.37 E:0.096453 |  This is not the time to talk about that now.
[15177.16 - 15179.16] P:1267.24 E:0.091529 |  So look, that's down to him.
[15179.16 - 15182.16] P:1454.90 E:0.102162 |  He'll go away and think about it. Right now we're all just hurting.
[15183.16 - 15186.16] P:1798.55 E:0.102394 |  Harry Kane with Kelly Somers.
[15186.16 - 15190.16] P:1782.79 E:0.111045 |  It was a bit difficult to hear some of that because of how loudly they were playing.
[15190.16 - 15192.16] P:1795.28 E:0.106201 |  We are the champions here.
[15192.16 - 15197.16] P:1829.44 E:0.108759 |  But what I did hear Matt Upton was him say it's been a tough tournament.
[15197.16 - 15200.16] P:1860.68 E:0.107914 |  We've had to show a lot of resilience.
[15200.16 - 15205.16] P:1806.18 E:0.121293 |  And maybe what we saw in this final encapsulates the kind of tournament
[15205.16 - 15207.16] P:1737.57 E:0.111319 |  that England have had really.
[15207.16 - 15212.16] P:1864.81 E:0.117258 |  I completely agree. How the game is gone, the kind of way that we've played,
[15212.16 - 15217.16] P:1873.97 E:0.116114 |  but we're playing against a much better opposition than we've faced anywhere near
[15217.16 - 15219.16] P:1936.69 E:0.110607 |  so far in this tournament.
[15219.16 - 15224.16] P:1712.82 E:0.105539 |  I thought the first half would have been satisfactory to how England could have
[15224.16 - 15227.16] P:1899.65 E:0.112782 |  won this tournament that you're going at 0-0.
[15227.16 - 15231.16] P:1966.14 E:0.104331 |  Okay, you've not had much of the ball, but you've stopped their real threat.
[15231.16 - 15235.16] P:1946.71 E:0.118301 |  And from then on, you obviously the early goal in the second half really did change the game
[15235.16 - 15238.16] P:1722.08 E:0.118440 |  and it opened up a bit and there was differences to it.
[15238.16 - 15244.16] P:1860.34 E:0.114856 |  But I mean, it's not been an easy follow England this tournament.
[15244.16 - 15250.16] P:1917.17 E:0.112705 |  We've spent a lot of time in and around it absorbing a lot of the kind of comments
[15250.16 - 15253.16] P:1890.43 E:0.109421 |  and analysing when we sat off the matches.
[15253.16 - 15255.16] P:2004.35 E:0.110679 |  Haven't we tried to analyse the game?
[15255.16 - 15256.16] P:1941.65 E:0.129661 |  It's been confusing.
[15256.16 - 15260.16] P:1948.27 E:0.111030 |  It has. It's been difficult because there hasn't been that clear style or plan.
[15260.16 - 15265.16] P:2005.31 E:0.108885 |  And we've gone into the tournament, kind of not knowing who our central midfield player is going to be.
[15265.16 - 15270.16] P:2068.40 E:0.115826 |  And you find out two games in and he's made a lot of really good calls in this tournament,
[15270.16 - 15275.16] P:1998.39 E:0.113808 |  Gareth, but when you compare it to that team in red that we've watched this evening
[15275.16 - 15278.16] P:1979.84 E:0.110042 |  and how they've gone about attacking this tournament
[15278.16 - 15284.16] P:2005.64 E:0.113345 |  and kind of really taking it apart and taking their game, putting their stamp on it,
[15284.16 - 15286.16] P:2038.85 E:0.108595 |  it's night and day.
[15286.16 - 15290.16] P:1893.51 E:0.117672 |  And I think you can really tell by, you know, just by watching both teams play.
[15290.16 - 15293.16] P:1864.18 E:0.127503 |  So imagine for a second that you won today.
[15293.16 - 15294.16] P:1835.31 E:0.114961 |  It could have happened.
[15294.16 - 15295.16] P:1958.96 E:0.104173 |  Yep.
[15295.16 - 15297.16] P:1834.42 E:0.120790 |  You got the interest of time, penalties, whatever.
[15297.16 - 15301.16] P:1932.69 E:0.118915 |  Who would have come out and say, right, that was great,
[15301.16 - 15306.16] P:1907.78 E:0.112532 |  but to actually match what Spain have done, the losers,
[15306.16 - 15309.16] P:1811.05 E:0.120654 |  we really have to move on and try something else.
[15309.16 - 15310.16] P:1842.19 E:0.121062 |  Nobody.
[15310.16 - 15311.16] P:1949.38 E:0.092180 |  Yeah?
[15311.16 - 15314.16] P:1798.73 E:0.114776 |  No, because it wouldn't have been the time tonight, would it?
[15314.16 - 15318.16] P:1891.99 E:0.119312 |  No, but I'm saying, would have been the analysis of the federation, of the media of yourself,
[15318.16 - 15321.16] P:1895.92 E:0.115637 |  saying, yeah, we won, but actually we have more.
[15321.16 - 15322.16] P:2026.09 E:0.105026 |  We should have to show more.
[15322.16 - 15324.16] P:1988.66 E:0.121568 |  We shouldn't just show resilience.
[15324.16 - 15329.16] P:1899.10 E:0.102629 |  So in a way, it's not a terrible defeat, can I say that?
[15329.16 - 15330.16] P:1852.14 E:0.057960 |  In a way.
[15330.16 - 15334.16] P:1957.39 E:0.115600 |  But isn't that like the conversation that we had with Julian Lorona ahead of the semi-final,
[15334.16 - 15339.16] P:1883.67 E:0.106527 |  that he was happy for France to slog their way through to the last four,
[15339.16 - 15344.16] P:1976.10 E:0.109527 |  and yet when they lost, he then said they were going to slaughter Didier Deschamps.
[15344.16 - 15349.16] P:1668.89 E:0.101159 |  That's what I'm getting at, that the potential happens with France as well.
[15349.16 - 15352.16] P:1669.49 E:0.110797 |  Winning doesn't explain everything, not in my eyes,
[15352.16 - 15357.16] P:1817.52 E:0.116317 |  because in the long term, you're going to find a day like today, which is not going to be enough.
[15357.16 - 15361.16] P:1889.52 E:0.117095 |  So you have now an opportunity to grow from this and say, you know what,
[15361.16 - 15365.16] P:1816.52 E:0.111109 |  Bellingham and Fodden and Saka, the better players that we see,
[15365.16 - 15368.16] P:1794.96 E:0.119452 |  the minor is going to be 21 in the next tournament.
[15368.16 - 15371.16] P:1834.83 E:0.118086 |  There is the opportunity to dominate the games,
[15371.16 - 15373.16] P:1875.62 E:0.115437 |  to be the guys that decide what happens in the pitch,
[15373.16 - 15375.16] P:1793.65 E:0.117950 |  but not by not having the ball, by having it.
[15375.16 - 15378.16] P:1925.32 E:0.109099 |  You have the flexibility to go and give your all out.
[15378.16 - 15380.16] P:1836.82 E:0.112315 |  That doesn't happen overnight, does it?
[15380.16 - 15384.16] P:1893.64 E:0.106715 |  That gets built, that gets put in, although all those qualifiers,
[15384.16 - 15388.16] P:1919.36 E:0.109080 |  all those friendly matches, it's a theme, it's a constant theme that's getting fed into it.
[15388.16 - 15392.16] P:1945.67 E:0.112612 |  And on the bag maybe, are heralds for the feed.
[15392.16 - 15394.16] P:2028.93 E:0.122825 |  I don't think England will be able to grow,
[15394.16 - 15397.16] P:1941.73 E:0.120504 |  because now there will be the uncertainty over the manager's future.
[15397.16 - 15399.16] P:1932.41 E:0.115663 |  That will now be the major talking point,
[15399.16 - 15402.16] P:1879.07 E:0.115616 |  he'll be asked, no doubt by John and others.
[15402.16 - 15404.16] P:1921.74 E:0.114053 |  Already we had Kelly Somers asking Harry Kane,
[15404.16 - 15406.16] P:1915.78 E:0.108508 |  I asked Harry Kane that question yesterday,
[15406.16 - 15410.16] P:1920.74 E:0.117827 |  do you fear that this is going to be Garry Southgate's last game in charge?
[15410.16 - 15412.16] P:1780.61 E:0.116810 |  There will be a number of people back home,
[15412.16 - 15415.16] P:1934.59 E:0.109589 |  who will think now that he should leave.
[15415.16 - 15418.16] P:1910.23 E:0.114064 |  And not like Guillain, who think England has still got an opportunity to grow.
[15418.16 - 15421.16] P:1911.43 E:0.115726 |  Should there be, well there needs to be a quick decision,
[15421.16 - 15425.16] P:1927.77 E:0.117130 |  because we can talk about the rights and the wrong,
[15425.16 - 15428.16] P:1907.36 E:0.115414 |  but essentially it's what happens next.
[15428.16 - 15431.16] P:1842.70 E:0.118902 |  And the thing which has disappointed me in this tournament,
[15431.16 - 15434.16] P:1818.26 E:0.117973 |  going into the tournament, you see the attacking players,
[15434.16 - 15437.16] P:1925.92 E:0.121105 |  that Games just mentioned, which we've talked about.
[15437.16 - 15440.16] P:1845.08 E:0.122138 |  I expected far more from England in the final third,
[15440.16 - 15442.16] P:1684.17 E:0.113265 |  that hasn't happened, what are the reasons for that?
[15442.16 - 15444.16] P:1839.31 E:0.118998 |  And this is why it's a good thing,
[15444.16 - 15446.16] P:1752.74 E:0.115841 |  I'm gathered for Garry Southgate and the England team,
[15446.16 - 15448.16] P:1771.78 E:0.117565 |  it's a good thing Spain have won this tournament.
[15448.16 - 15450.16] P:1784.78 E:0.117032 |  Because they have played a beautiful game,
[15450.16 - 15455.16] P:1832.82 E:0.119645 |  they have a lovely balance to their play.
[15455.16 - 15459.16] P:1860.09 E:0.117492 |  You look at them player for player, going into the tournament,
[15459.16 - 15461.16] P:1866.54 E:0.119704 |  and you talk about the England stars,
[15461.16 - 15465.16] P:1866.06 E:0.117758 |  would you say that Spain have more stars?
[15465.16 - 15467.16] P:1869.13 E:0.115478 |  I think there's a debate to be had there,
[15467.16 - 15471.16] P:1930.75 E:0.113000 |  but Spain are a team, and England are bits and pieces.
[15471.16 - 15473.16] P:1831.75 E:0.099658 |  But does De La Fuente not create that, Chris?
[15473.16 - 15477.16] P:1869.07 E:0.105109 |  That's, you know, that these players are shining in a system in a way.
[15477.16 - 15478.16] P:1814.11 E:0.115279 |  Absolutely.
[15478.16 - 15480.16] P:1918.97 E:0.116563 |  But that's not an individual thing, is it?
[15480.16 - 15481.16] P:1952.16 E:0.113585 |  It can't be individual.
[15481.16 - 15483.16] P:1834.43 E:0.116838 |  No, and that's right, but then you've got to say,
[15483.16 - 15486.16] P:1923.60 E:0.111659 |  Gareth was hampered with the left-back situation.
[15486.16 - 15490.16] P:1955.72 E:0.117856 |  That was, always has been clumsy, hasn't it?
[15490.16 - 15492.16] P:1935.52 E:0.113900 |  Right, but the left-back...
[15492.16 - 15494.16] P:1980.83 E:0.114879 |  Yeah, but that doesn't take away the theme, though, does it?
[15494.16 - 15497.16] P:1791.31 E:0.110256 |  You know, look, Spain bring on, you know, key players come off,
[15497.16 - 15500.16] P:1807.53 E:0.110207 |  they bring in another player, it's business as usual.
[15500.16 - 15501.16] P:1755.90 E:0.065277 |  It stays the same.
[15501.16 - 15503.16] P:1911.45 E:0.118694 |  But to illustrate Chris's point,
[15503.16 - 15506.16] P:1962.45 E:0.109092 |  Gareth Sosidad had five players in this squad,
[15506.16 - 15510.16] P:1916.08 E:0.110068 |  which is as many as Real Madrid have had
[15510.16 - 15513.16] P:1817.27 E:0.106760 |  in 12 major tournaments combined.
[15514.16 - 15518.16] P:1834.22 E:0.106314 |  He's moulded a team, lots of our players.
[15518.16 - 15520.16] P:1740.58 E:0.116196 |  And that was going to be my next point to you, is he?
[15520.16 - 15526.16] P:1817.87 E:0.107659 |  Which is, we all are culpable in some ways,
[15526.16 - 15531.16] P:1881.99 E:0.105278 |  I think, with the football community, or the media,
[15531.16 - 15536.16] P:1783.29 E:0.107842 |  all fans of getting to a tournament, getting to a squad of players,
[15536.16 - 15539.16] P:1782.93 E:0.105863 |  and saying, well, they have to play, and they have to play,
[15539.16 - 15541.16] P:1690.19 E:0.116527 |  and they have to play because they're a great player,
[15541.16 - 15543.16] P:1802.40 E:0.120272 |  or they're a Premier League player of the year,
[15543.16 - 15545.16] P:1700.73 E:0.126079 |  or they're a La Liga player of the year,
[15545.16 - 15546.16] P:1771.89 E:0.112511 |  or they're a footballer of the year,
[15546.16 - 15549.16] P:1805.56 E:0.122754 |  or they're a contender for the ball, whatever it may be.
[15549.16 - 15554.16] P:1744.66 E:0.117150 |  Every great team can't fit all its great players in, necessarily.
[15554.16 - 15558.16] P:1776.18 E:0.123925 |  Absolutely not, and we've seen it over the years in major tournaments.
[15558.16 - 15562.16] P:1730.70 E:0.118413 |  Big names from big nations being dropped,
[15562.16 - 15564.16] P:1736.38 E:0.116542 |  we've seen it with Portugal.
[15564.16 - 15566.16] P:1756.35 E:0.115669 |  Why did they not progress further in the tournament?
[15566.16 - 15568.16] P:1626.42 E:0.118383 |  The elephant in the room is Cristiano Ronaldo,
[15568.16 - 15569.16] P:1750.16 E:0.101707 |  who stayed on the pitch.
[15569.16 - 15571.16] P:1702.28 E:0.110919 |  He's a big name, but was he right for the team?
[15571.16 - 15573.16] P:1650.93 E:0.113149 |  Was he right for the system? Probably not.
[15573.16 - 15576.16] P:1865.56 E:0.110583 |  And I wouldn't necessarily say England.
[15576.16 - 15578.16] P:1644.38 E:0.120505 |  We had our discussions earlier in the tournament
[15578.16 - 15580.16] P:1761.76 E:0.108671 |  about Foden and Bellion, and I hold my hands.
[15580.16 - 15584.16] P:1486.08 E:0.111697 |  I've been somebody that's, I mean, there's absolutely no space
[15584.16 - 15587.16] P:1648.49 E:0.108237 |  to criticise either of those players because of how talented they are.
[15587.16 - 15590.16] P:1625.31 E:0.105887 |  Do they work together? In my opinion, no.
[15590.16 - 15594.16] P:1664.34 E:0.113485 |  Can they find that formula in the future? Absolutely.
[15594.16 - 15595.16] P:1783.37 E:0.118784 |  But it might be something different.
[15595.16 - 15596.16] P:1676.80 E:0.105283 |  It might be a different tweak.
[15596.16 - 15600.16] P:1722.24 E:0.113560 |  I think one of the massive positives that we've seen emerge is,
[15600.16 - 15603.16] P:1744.76 E:0.104116 |  I think the midfield is pretty set for the next five years,
[15603.16 - 15605.16] P:1518.12 E:0.111132 |  at least, with Kobimeno alongside Declan Rice.
[15605.16 - 15612.16] P:1602.52 E:0.111228 |  Have they played probably at 60 to 70% of their in-possession ability?
[15612.16 - 15615.16] P:1591.10 E:0.105766 |  Yeah. So there, again, there's a little bit of excitement
[15615.16 - 15618.16] P:1656.37 E:0.110109 |  with some space to grow. There's more to give.
[15618.16 - 15624.16] P:1678.39 E:0.107761 |  But I think that that is what makes international management so difficult.
[15624.16 - 15627.16] P:1793.65 E:0.115833 |  And Dela Fuente here tonight and throughout the tournament
[15627.16 - 15631.16] P:1713.73 E:0.111384 |  has shown that he's got the knouse to make the correct decisions
[15631.16 - 15635.16] P:1690.07 E:0.103933 |  to provide a team of exceptional balance and fluidity.
[15635.16 - 15637.16] P:1712.42 E:0.107648 |  And England have yet, really, throughout this tournament
[15637.16 - 15639.16] P:1645.32 E:0.101590 |  to find that correct formula.
[15639.16 - 15641.16] P:1633.10 E:0.107353 |  They've fallen back on their resilience and their heart
[15641.16 - 15642.16] P:1728.21 E:0.100332 |  and their determination.
[15642.16 - 15645.16] P:1718.89 E:0.102233 |  But fundamentally, I think justice has been done tonight.
[15645.16 - 15647.16] P:1746.93 E:0.098414 |  The best footballing team has won,
[15647.16 - 15650.16] P:1723.42 E:0.099536 |  and everybody has thoroughly enjoyed watching this Spanish team play.
[15651.16 - 15656.16] P:1702.39 E:0.123305 |  When you talk about, you know, fitting your best players into the team,
[15656.16 - 15658.16] P:1784.57 E:0.123222 |  well, we have this tournament,
[15658.16 - 15661.16] P:1867.78 E:0.098212 |  and has it been the most effective team?
[15661.16 - 15664.16] P:1714.68 E:0.111674 |  I think that's the thing you're going to take away from it, Chris,
[15664.16 - 15667.16] P:1926.49 E:0.103261 |  whether or not you can try and put your best players in.
[15667.16 - 15669.16] P:1739.78 E:0.105618 |  Yeah, I get that.
[15669.16 - 15672.16] P:1874.70 E:0.116816 |  But then, so then, the argument would be, there's no doubt,
[15672.16 - 15676.16] P:1807.79 E:0.113887 |  England have been so one-sided in the way that they play.
[15677.16 - 15680.16] P:1813.88 E:0.106745 |  But the left-hand side, England have been, you know, redundant.
[15680.16 - 15683.16] P:1839.74 E:0.114675 |  They've been, you know, so ineffective.
[15683.16 - 15685.16] P:1974.42 E:0.110278 |  But who's the answer from the left-hand side?
[15685.16 - 15688.16] P:1801.64 E:0.111775 |  But that would have been the point one, see, in that sense.
[15688.16 - 15692.16] P:1804.69 E:0.103903 |  You, therefore, if the two of them can't play together,
[15692.16 - 15695.16] P:1839.34 E:0.109114 |  but you have as, or you have Gordon,
[15695.16 - 15698.16] P:1816.94 E:0.105612 |  you've got an out-and-out win with that.
[15698.16 - 15701.16] P:1768.38 E:0.108756 |  Yeah, and I get all that right.
[15701.16 - 15705.16] P:1918.77 E:0.104362 |  But I also get what Gareth would be thinking.
[15705.16 - 15708.16] P:1968.74 E:0.106183 |  You know, he's going to put out the best team
[15708.16 - 15710.16] P:1903.52 E:0.117157 |  which he thinks can win a game.
[15710.16 - 15712.16] P:1801.78 E:0.112118 |  That's going to be his thinking.
[15712.16 - 15715.16] P:1815.88 E:0.116456 |  So there's a reason why Ezra and Gordon aren't playing,
[15715.16 - 15717.16] P:1953.59 E:0.106039 |  albeit I take your point.
[15717.16 - 15719.16] P:1906.30 E:0.116992 |  But he will have his own reasons.
[15719.16 - 15721.16] P:1877.06 E:0.110658 |  I'd love to know what those reasons are.
[15721.16 - 15725.16] P:1904.75 E:0.113250 |  I think the left-back situation was ridiculous coming into the tournament,
[15725.16 - 15726.16] P:1971.78 E:0.104038 |  nursing sure through.
[15726.16 - 15728.16] P:1908.94 E:0.113938 |  I mean, he didn't do badly tonight.
[15728.16 - 15731.16] P:1852.87 E:0.113969 |  I'm not knocking him, but that was crazy.
[15731.16 - 15733.16] P:1806.18 E:0.113491 |  Let's, let's...
[15733.16 - 15736.16] P:1864.01 E:0.109075 |  No, no, no, the thing is, England got to the final.
[15736.16 - 15738.16] P:1874.69 E:0.112701 |  So, you know, something went right,
[15738.16 - 15741.16] P:1795.64 E:0.105662 |  but is it sustainable for the future to play on heart and resilience?
[15741.16 - 15743.16] P:1859.45 E:0.105913 |  Yes, you need that, but it's not sustainable
[15743.16 - 15745.16] P:1769.56 E:0.114810 |  when you've got the likes of Spain,
[15745.16 - 15747.16] P:1777.22 E:0.111378 |  who are so incredible with the football
[15747.16 - 15749.16] P:1844.49 E:0.110158 |  and can destroy you in a matter of seconds
[15749.16 - 15752.16] P:1786.37 E:0.106307 |  by moving the ball from left to right, like they did tonight.
[15752.16 - 15755.16] P:1719.60 E:0.120012 |  Here are the thoughts of Gareth Southgate with Kelly.
[15755.16 - 15759.16] P:1515.04 E:0.102536 |  Gareth, commiserations, another final, another heartbreak ultimately.
[15759.16 - 15761.16] P:1328.72 E:0.083641 |  How do you reflect on that?
[15762.16 - 15768.16] P:1470.09 E:0.094047 |  Yeah, look, I think we've competed until the very end of the final.
[15769.16 - 15774.16] P:1425.08 E:0.093849 |  I think today we didn't, we didn't keep possession of the ball quite well enough.
[15774.16 - 15777.16] P:1349.35 E:0.084821 |  And especially when we defended well,
[15777.16 - 15780.16] P:1535.58 E:0.100198 |  we got moments where they press you really well,
[15780.16 - 15782.16] P:1409.24 E:0.087537 |  you've got to get out of that pressure,
[15782.16 - 15784.16] P:1424.95 E:0.086181 |  and we weren't able to do that.
[15784.16 - 15787.16] P:1332.98 E:0.094133 |  And yeah, in the end, that meant they had more control of the game,
[15787.16 - 15790.16] P:1333.07 E:0.086598 |  and that can wear you down a bit.
[15790.16 - 15794.16] P:1408.10 E:0.079241 |  That said, we were still right in there when we get the equaliser,
[15794.16 - 15797.16] P:1375.58 E:0.089840 |  so the game was still wide open.
[15797.16 - 15799.16] P:1295.56 E:0.076319 |  I'd need to see both the goals back to be able to,
[15799.16 - 15801.16] P:1309.78 E:0.082187 |  I haven't really watched them back,
[15801.16 - 15805.16] P:1231.33 E:0.087457 |  but yeah, obviously a big chance at the end as well to equalise.
[15805.16 - 15809.16] P:1278.54 E:0.082994 |  So yeah, as always in these games, it's fine margins,
[15809.16 - 15811.16] P:1292.02 E:0.094124 |  but I think they were the best team in the tournament,
[15811.16 - 15814.16] P:1300.52 E:0.091276 |  and I think over the piece they deserved to win.
[15814.16 - 15817.16] P:1377.81 E:0.089235 |  Substitutes have changed games for you throughout the tournament.
[15817.16 - 15819.16] P:1287.80 E:0.090473 |  Col Palmer almost did it for you again,
[15819.16 - 15823.16] P:1420.27 E:0.091274 |  but did it feel like maybe it was one game, one moment too far?
[15824.16 - 15828.16] P:1229.01 E:0.083041 |  I don't know, I mean, it's easy to say that.
[15830.16 - 15834.16] P:1333.62 E:0.092934 |  And there's definitely a disadvantage to having a day less to prepare,
[15834.16 - 15838.16] P:1331.28 E:0.089978 |  but we were still in the game at 80 minutes,
[15838.16 - 15843.16] P:1203.40 E:0.075064 |  and yeah, it's going to take a while to sort of pick all the bones out of it really.
[15843.16 - 15845.16] P:1297.15 E:0.096046 |  You took Harry Kane off your captain,
[15845.16 - 15848.16] P:1405.40 E:0.088179 |  England's record goal scorer early once again.
[15848.16 - 15851.16] P:1406.33 E:0.087162 |  Who's getting him into the games, getting the best out of him?
[15851.16 - 15854.16] P:1256.92 E:0.078602 |  Been a bit of a problem for you in England this tournament.
[15854.16 - 15858.16] P:1303.23 E:0.089312 |  Yeah, look, I think physically it's been a tough period for Amy.
[15858.16 - 15861.16] P:1373.56 E:0.077806 |  He came in short of games,
[15861.16 - 15867.16] P:1158.89 E:0.086362 |  and not quite got up to the level that we'd have all hoped.
[15867.16 - 15869.16] P:1453.98 E:0.093168 |  The games are hugely demanding,
[15869.16 - 15873.16] P:1343.30 E:0.087291 |  and we felt Ollie's freshness would allow us to press a bit better,
[15873.16 - 15877.16] P:1279.50 E:0.086195 |  which we needed to do, would offer us a threat in behind.
[15877.16 - 15883.16] P:1378.30 E:0.081298 |  So I thought the two substitutes that came on did what we wanted them to really.
[15884.16 - 15887.16] P:1820.47 E:0.110750 |  Gary Southgate with Kelly Somers-Eat,
[15887.16 - 15889.16] P:1809.80 E:0.105682 |  he also said in another post-match interview,
[15889.16 - 15891.16] P:1854.33 E:0.100568 |  whether this was with ITV or not,
[15891.16 - 15893.16] P:1820.19 E:0.101788 |  now's not the time to talk about my future.
[15893.16 - 15896.16] P:1892.55 E:0.104884 |  I mean, it is fine margins, isn't it, Izzy?
[15896.16 - 15901.16] P:1762.37 E:0.098853 |  Because for all, we all dive deep into what's gone wrong,
[15901.16 - 15903.16] P:1834.14 E:0.088390 |  and this and that and the other,
[15903.16 - 15907.16] P:1823.77 E:0.099894 |  there was a saving of clearance off the line right at the end.
[15907.16 - 15910.16] P:1782.91 E:0.107026 |  There was actually a ball into Oli Wockies that he tried to turn with
[15910.16 - 15913.16] P:1803.52 E:0.088879 |  and just couldn't quite control it. They had chances at the end.
[15913.16 - 15915.16] P:1871.52 E:0.115497 |  And there was also that chance,
[15915.16 - 15918.16] P:1872.51 E:0.101057 |  I think it was down the right-hand side in the second half.
[15918.16 - 15920.16] P:1803.66 E:0.102987 |  I think it might have been Foden,
[15920.16 - 15922.16] P:1823.03 E:0.089062 |  got a really nice little ball into the six-yard box,
[15922.16 - 15924.16] P:1822.08 E:0.109017 |  and Harry Kane was just looking at the back post,
[15924.16 - 15927.16] P:1825.57 E:0.095239 |  and I'm thinking Harry Kane,
[15927.16 - 15929.16] P:1692.97 E:0.111925 |  getting him into that central area of the box,
[15929.16 - 15931.16] P:1748.13 E:0.096773 |  he would have had a typical Harry Kane tap in,
[15931.16 - 15934.16] P:1808.44 E:0.112187 |  but he just wasn't in there, and critical of Harry Kane,
[15934.16 - 15936.16] P:1788.43 E:0.106394 |  but they did have chances,
[15936.16 - 15939.16] P:1730.99 E:0.110909 |  and Oli Wockies made a massive difference running in behind,
[15939.16 - 15942.16] P:1742.90 E:0.110652 |  and I thought, at this point, when they tried knocking the ball in behind England,
[15942.16 - 15945.16] P:1708.35 E:0.108886 |  I thought, hang on a minute, I think we're going to get Spain on their back here,
[15945.16 - 15947.16] P:1763.93 E:0.106923 |  but unfortunately, might you say,
[15947.16 - 15949.16] P:1870.83 E:0.101825 |  because it was the fine margins tonight.
[15949.16 - 15956.16] P:1851.37 E:0.115459 |  I don't quite know where Gareth was going with the Harry Kane wasn't fit enough.
[15956.16 - 15958.16] P:1828.74 E:0.117721 |  I don't understand that.
[15958.16 - 15962.16] P:1739.57 E:0.108732 |  I mean, there has to be questions asked of Gareth,
[15962.16 - 15966.16] P:1869.27 E:0.097372 |  why is playing a player who is unfit?
[15966.16 - 15969.16] P:1899.68 E:0.108304 |  Do you think he's looked as sharp as what you think is better?
[15969.16 - 15971.16] P:1896.40 E:0.099131 |  Well, I don't, but we're not in the England camp,
[15971.16 - 15975.16] P:1867.05 E:0.107618 |  we don't know how fit or unfit he is,
[15975.16 - 15979.16] P:1930.21 E:0.099964 |  but I don't see that, if it's a fitness issue,
[15979.16 - 15982.16] P:1917.00 E:0.105215 |  why he's actually starting a game,
[15982.16 - 15984.16] P:1948.95 E:0.105332 |  because you don't want to carry players,
[15984.16 - 15986.16] P:1820.62 E:0.111470 |  and that's essentially what Gareth is saying,
[15986.16 - 15992.16] P:1917.09 E:0.100843 |  and that's also a slight on Oli Wockies and Ivan Tony, isn't it?
[15992.16 - 15995.16] P:1905.57 E:0.105694 |  From the outside, I hear all of you,
[15995.16 - 15999.16] P:1797.15 E:0.109737 |  and I sense what's happening, because you happen in other tournaments,
[15999.16 - 16001.16] P:1853.37 E:0.111682 |  you're going to look for one, two, three reasons,
[16001.16 - 16004.16] P:1918.96 E:0.106308 |  one, two, three names to explain all this,
[16004.16 - 16007.16] P:1866.98 E:0.104383 |  but out of everything we said, what Matthew said earlier,
[16007.16 - 16010.16] P:1882.67 E:0.104379 |  is the one that resonates the closest to what's happening in Spain,
[16010.16 - 16013.16] P:2015.62 E:0.108818 |  if you want that as a reference, is the culture.
[16013.16 - 16017.16] P:1960.16 E:0.111514 |  Do you want a team to play without shackles on?
[16017.16 - 16019.16] P:1842.29 E:0.118741 |  Do you want them to be brave?
[16019.16 - 16023.16] P:1940.19 E:0.110697 |  Do you want to approach the game, dominating it, being offensive?
[16023.16 - 16027.16] P:2007.98 E:0.108186 |  Then you have to change leadership perhaps,
[16027.16 - 16029.16] P:1932.77 E:0.103413 |  or certainly from the Federation,
[16029.16 - 16032.16] P:1953.37 E:0.093461 |  he has to come a different kind of thing, you can ask Gareth how to do it,
[16032.16 - 16036.16] P:1953.14 E:0.108590 |  can you do more of what has taken Spain to win, he may be able to do it.
[16036.16 - 16041.16] P:1879.09 E:0.111366 |  Do you know what, is it time we started to look at other areas of the team,
[16041.16 - 16046.16] P:1815.55 E:0.116715 |  other areas where we think we're alright in that position,
[16046.16 - 16048.16] P:1866.92 E:0.110209 |  and when I say that, what about Declan Rice,
[16048.16 - 16050.16] P:1926.69 E:0.105967 |  when you watch the Spanish midfielders play,
[16050.16 - 16055.16] P:1990.06 E:0.111903 |  the way they knit the game together, why can't Declan Rice do that?
[16055.16 - 16061.16] P:1969.60 E:0.109071 |  That's not really his game, but that's something that I think England can improve.
[16061.16 - 16066.16] P:1993.28 E:0.111156 |  Does he do it well for Michael Arthetta, a Spanish coach that likes to move the ball quickly?
[16066.16 - 16068.16] P:1874.65 E:0.119371 |  I think he has a slightly different role, doesn't he?
[16068.16 - 16073.16] P:2024.66 E:0.107860 |  That's what I'm saying, so it's about the picture,
[16073.16 - 16077.16] P:1967.47 E:0.105929 |  you can't take that from there, it comes from the top,
[16077.16 - 16080.16] P:1959.35 E:0.115710 |  and it filters down the style and how you play,
[16080.16 - 16085.16] P:1982.62 E:0.107360 |  you know, some of these players play for top coaches, Guardiola, Arthetta,
[16085.16 - 16088.16] P:1913.90 E:0.108967 |  in terms of the style, it's very similar to this.
[16088.16 - 16091.16] P:1937.91 E:0.109229 |  You don't have to hold the midfielder of that quality anywhere,
[16091.16 - 16096.16] P:1952.12 E:0.112146 |  you just don't have it, you're just playing a 19-year-old who may be that kind of player,
[16096.16 - 16099.16] P:1964.80 E:0.112984 |  we're not so sure yet, so imagine in a tournament like this,
[16099.16 - 16102.16] P:2000.30 E:0.107834 |  in a final like this, like the 19-year-old will do, because you just don't have it.
[16102.16 - 16108.16] P:1986.30 E:0.109265 |  You're also, I don't know Matt, you're probably, it's very difficult to compare,
[16108.16 - 16112.16] P:2008.10 E:0.106949 |  and like for like tonight with the two midfielders,
[16112.16 - 16116.16] P:1981.09 E:0.108855 |  because whenever one of the England players had the ball,
[16116.16 - 16120.16] P:1941.88 E:0.112775 |  they had like three men round them, whenever Spain had the ball,
[16120.16 - 16125.16] P:2008.80 E:0.107945 |  that press in which again has been talking about all tournament, wasn't that?
[16125.16 - 16129.16] P:1950.69 E:0.107818 |  But that's another thing that's cultural, it's coached, it's drilled,
[16129.16 - 16134.16] P:1980.16 E:0.112471 |  and I spoke about, I mean last summer we were in Malta,
[16134.16 - 16137.16] P:1954.37 E:0.111445 |  or whatever game, qualifier or friendly, whatever it is,
[16137.16 - 16141.16] P:1995.01 E:0.104228 |  they're the moments where I'm sure they must have to look at the objective,
[16141.16 - 16144.16] P:1883.14 E:0.106493 |  and okay you need to win because it's a qualifier or it's a friendly,
[16144.16 - 16146.16] P:2015.39 E:0.112162 |  you want to play well, but there'll be a theme to right,
[16146.16 - 16149.16] P:1913.20 E:0.103048 |  we have to play like this today, and it might not go that well,
[16149.16 - 16152.16] P:1998.33 E:0.105388 |  but the thing, the target you're looking to hit as a coach was achieved,
[16152.16 - 16154.16] P:1946.90 E:0.104606 |  and I think that's how you get your message into the group,
[16154.16 - 16162.16] P:1957.37 E:0.097310 |  that's what you care about, and how can Spain produce that kind of collective theme?
[16162.16 - 16164.16] P:1995.06 E:0.112485 |  For one of the best players for Spain throughout the whole tournament,
[16164.16 - 16167.16] P:2008.66 E:0.100637 |  there's been Fabian Ruiz, Paris Saint-Germain,
[16167.16 - 16172.16] P:1996.65 E:0.107138 |  after Euro 2020, he had about a three year absence from the national side,
[16172.16 - 16177.16] P:1946.09 E:0.097359 |  he's brought him back in after that amount of time,
[16177.16 - 16180.16] P:1929.53 E:0.113260 |  he links the play, when Rodri goes off, he drops a bit deeper,
[16180.16 - 16186.16] P:1946.38 E:0.100545 |  composed on the ball, works hard off it, he's been a player,
[16186.16 - 16188.16] P:1907.17 E:0.115430 |  we haven't got that type of player.
[16188.16 - 16194.16] P:1868.93 E:0.103703 |  No, but the out of possession side of it is huge for their success,
[16194.16 - 16199.16] P:1876.41 E:0.103093 |  because where they're winning the ball then allows them to play quickly as well.
[16199.16 - 16202.16] P:1857.95 E:0.111596 |  I spoke to Declan Rice after one of the warm up games,
[16202.16 - 16205.16] P:1921.55 E:0.106225 |  and he said being a number six gives me the confidence, that's my best position,
[16205.16 - 16207.16] P:1934.75 E:0.102604 |  but he doesn't play as a six.
[16207.16 - 16210.16] P:1877.19 E:0.104631 |  No, but he doesn't play like I say domestically,
[16210.16 - 16213.16] P:1912.84 E:0.111499 |  now he's moved a little bit higher up, hasn't he, and wide,
[16213.16 - 16217.16] P:1966.65 E:0.113404 |  and he doesn't play in that area, but do we have a Rodri?
[16217.16 - 16220.16] P:1983.50 E:0.100408 |  We're going back again to the same thing,
[16220.16 - 16223.16] P:1925.61 E:0.103458 |  can he play in this position, can he play in that position?
[16223.16 - 16227.16] P:1938.11 E:0.113649 |  We ask the players to actually be able to identify what position they need to be,
[16227.16 - 16233.16] P:1908.14 E:0.106274 |  at what particular move, and it seems to be like there's a rigidity about how Indian players play.
[16233.16 - 16237.16] P:1852.77 E:0.100821 |  But don't you feel it needs to be about the start, and then you find the players after?
[16237.16 - 16240.16] P:1807.79 E:0.107681 |  Do you look for the player first, and say,
[16240.16 - 16243.16] P:1776.10 E:0.107035 |  oh, we're going to have to play like this because they're good at this,
[16243.16 - 16245.16] P:1725.97 E:0.099983 |  or is it this is how we're going to play, and then...
[16245.16 - 16248.16] P:1803.70 E:0.106430 |  Do you know it's not going to go that way, it's going to go about the manager,
[16248.16 - 16250.16] P:1830.63 E:0.105426 |  and the players, and the game, and the form of...
[16250.16 - 16254.16] P:1927.16 E:0.108758 |  But that, I think, that's the conversation that needs to be had in England.
[16254.16 - 16258.16] P:2041.54 E:0.108947 |  Why can't Declan Rice play that way?
[16258.16 - 16263.16] P:2026.32 E:0.114361 |  You know, a lot made of Bobby Maynou and his tournament,
[16263.16 - 16266.16] P:1964.08 E:0.106222 |  and people talk about how outstanding he has been.
[16266.16 - 16269.16] P:2008.31 E:0.109067 |  He also went missing tonight.
[16269.16 - 16274.16] P:2007.77 E:0.109331 |  So if they are England's two number sixes, or pivots,
[16274.16 - 16278.16] P:1998.71 E:0.106062 |  it's their responsibility to actually get on the ball and make the play.
[16278.16 - 16282.16] P:1919.23 E:0.108673 |  That's what Rodri does, that's what Faberian Ruiz does.
[16282.16 - 16286.16] P:1906.66 E:0.086219 |  But they have to be set up to have the ball, Chris, don't they?
[16286.16 - 16290.16] P:1862.27 E:0.091072 |  They have to be set up to have the ball, but I mean...
[16290.16 - 16293.16] P:1889.96 E:0.089213 |  You know, that's a basic principle of play.
[16293.16 - 16295.16] P:2002.68 E:0.104414 |  So why...
[16295.16 - 16300.16] P:1974.25 E:0.090070 |  So this, from England's perspective, is how do we get to that next level, isn't it?
[16300.16 - 16305.16] P:1936.66 E:0.100625 |  How can we... Nothing wrong with copying the way Spain play, by the way.
[16305.16 - 16306.16] P:1781.22 E:0.118130 |  Absolutely.
[16306.16 - 16309.16] P:1894.88 E:0.099027 |  How are we going to get there? And it's being brave enough to do that.
[16309.16 - 16313.16] P:1937.54 E:0.089210 |  And tonight, you see that Spain have that...
[16313.16 - 16316.16] P:1893.66 E:0.093657 |  They all have that trust in each other.
[16316.16 - 16321.16] P:1926.32 E:0.094652 |  Where, at England, it's like they aren't quite on the same wavelength,
[16321.16 - 16323.16] P:1843.16 E:0.096426 |  but this is the top, top level.
[16323.16 - 16326.16] P:1860.95 E:0.094528 |  Spain have done it to every team in this tournament, by the way.
[16326.16 - 16328.16] P:1799.38 E:0.090402 |  This isn't just in England, though.
[16328.16 - 16334.16] P:1875.25 E:0.105754 |  08, 08, 05, 9, 09, 6, 03. Chris is doing 6-0-6 in just a couple of minutes.
[16334.16 - 16336.16] P:1917.99 E:0.096579 |  You ready for that?
[16336.16 - 16338.16] P:2002.36 E:0.103326 |  Yeah, I can't wait.
[16338.16 - 16340.16] P:2024.24 E:0.099204 |  Do you want me to do it, Chris?
[16341.16 - 16344.16] P:1836.96 E:0.086944 |  LAUGHTER
[16344.16 - 16346.16] P:1829.76 E:0.112263 |  Final thoughts from everybody.
[16346.16 - 16348.16] P:1985.81 E:0.104705 |  I'll start with you, Guillem.
[16348.16 - 16351.16] P:1884.66 E:0.104803 |  Just on Spain, congratulations, because, as everybody has mentioned,
[16351.16 - 16353.16] P:1874.78 E:0.098149 |  they have been the best team in the tournament.
[16353.16 - 16356.16] P:1879.00 E:0.103812 |  And because he has, and this is not because I'm a Spanish,
[16356.16 - 16358.16] P:1701.83 E:0.098907 |  I'm glad that the best team has won,
[16358.16 - 16360.16] P:2001.27 E:0.095513 |  because that is...
[16360.16 - 16364.16] P:1850.34 E:0.103659 |  The kind of conversation we have in here, and I'm sure the Federation in England, etc.,
[16364.16 - 16367.16] P:1952.40 E:0.084366 |  will be like, what is it that they're doing?
[16367.16 - 16369.16] P:1941.91 E:0.091963 |  Because we won, it become fashionable.
[16369.16 - 16372.16] P:1943.26 E:0.096630 |  If we had lost, it should be the same kind of conversation,
[16372.16 - 16375.16] P:1925.88 E:0.090204 |  but what happens with the runners-up, people forget them.
[16375.16 - 16379.16] P:1928.91 E:0.091321 |  So I'm glad that what has happened in this tournament, it will not be forgotten.
[16379.16 - 16384.16] P:1922.95 E:0.103598 |  Is he final thoughts from behind the goal for the final time here in Germany?
[16384.16 - 16388.16] P:1873.38 E:0.099610 |  Well, just a terrific performance from Spain, an absolute joy to watch,
[16388.16 - 16390.16] P:1712.80 E:0.106263 |  the football they've played throughout the whole tournament,
[16390.16 - 16393.16] P:1883.58 E:0.102308 |  and plenty of question marks for the future for England,
[16393.16 - 16395.16] P:1697.60 E:0.093379 |  but also an exciting place to be as well.
[16395.16 - 16401.16] P:1833.23 E:0.098996 |  Yeah, another confusing post-match at the end of quite a confusing tournament, Matt.
[16401.16 - 16404.16] P:1915.25 E:0.099353 |  Well, just jump on the England rollercoaster, Chappers.
[16404.16 - 16406.16] P:1880.14 E:0.100335 |  That's how it's felt, to be honest.
[16406.16 - 16409.16] P:1730.50 E:0.109239 |  It's been up and down, it's been here and there, has it been entertaining?
[16409.16 - 16411.16] P:1644.73 E:0.095133 |  Yes, has there been drama?
[16411.16 - 16415.16] P:1868.97 E:0.097300 |  But that collective control and feel and message,
[16415.16 - 16419.16] P:1812.69 E:0.101603 |  you just feel that is that required to see that final bit over the line
[16419.16 - 16421.16] P:1815.95 E:0.089462 |  and get a tournament win?
[16421.16 - 16423.16] P:2051.88 E:0.109691 |  As he talks about the question marks,
[16423.16 - 16426.16] P:1913.89 E:0.103558 |  this now will be, as Guillem quite rightly says about the manager,
[16426.16 - 16428.16] P:1976.41 E:0.105344 |  the FA will leave it to him.
[16428.16 - 16431.16] P:1924.21 E:0.107862 |  He's seriously wavered after the World Cup in Qatar.
[16431.16 - 16434.16] P:1969.79 E:0.102876 |  That's why his contract is until December,
[16434.16 - 16437.16] P:1984.18 E:0.124925 |  because they know the FA, Mark Bullingham, that his emotions,
[16437.16 - 16439.16] P:2071.71 E:0.108734 |  his feelings will be running high.
[16439.16 - 16442.16] P:2029.45 E:0.106561 |  They will give him time to decompress.
[16442.16 - 16445.16] P:1987.44 E:0.098238 |  The FA will want Garas Southgate to continue,
[16445.16 - 16449.16] P:1933.24 E:0.108929 |  but Garas Southgate has always maintained that he will not outstay his welcome
[16449.16 - 16453.16] P:1946.46 E:0.101766 |  and the criticism that he's received here in this tournament has hurt him.
[16453.16 - 16459.16] P:1882.49 E:0.104471 |  I would expect Garas Southgate, it will be he who makes the decision, not the FA.
[16459.16 - 16462.16] P:1860.99 E:0.102994 |  You know him pretty well, what's your gut feeling?
[16462.16 - 16465.16] P:1868.52 E:0.099683 |  My gut feeling is, is that regardless,
[16465.16 - 16468.16] P:1725.88 E:0.104536 |  he would go whether they won or lost tonight.
[16470.16 - 16473.16] P:1743.74 E:0.096097 |  And we will end with John Murray in the tunnel.
[16473.16 - 16476.16] P:1751.40 E:0.098334 |  Yep, I'm just watching Luis Della Fuente,
[16476.16 - 16479.16] P:1606.33 E:0.115108 |  who has just walked into the interview area down here.
[16479.16 - 16484.16] P:1562.88 E:0.106685 |  He's wreathed in smiles, very much a contrast with Garas Southgate.
[16484.16 - 16487.16] P:1651.89 E:0.103905 |  When he walked down here about ten minutes ago,
[16487.16 - 16490.16] P:1634.69 E:0.103461 |  disappointment etched all over his face.
[16490.16 - 16494.16] P:1689.50 E:0.100027 |  As he walked down past us, turned to the right and went into the dressing room,
[16494.16 - 16497.16] P:1599.55 E:0.100614 |  and actually it's just now that the England dressing room door has opened
[16497.16 - 16501.16] P:1446.01 E:0.100999 |  and some of the players are beginning to come out to give their thoughts
[16501.16 - 16503.16] P:1591.18 E:0.101775 |  on what's happened here tonight.
[16503.16 - 16506.16] P:1606.01 E:0.104692 |  Garas Southgate is going to address the players first
[16506.16 - 16509.16] P:1497.94 E:0.115730 |  and I know the conversation that you've had about his future,
[16509.16 - 16514.16] P:1554.20 E:0.112442 |  I think Ian's absolutely right, this whole issue of not outstaying his welcome.
[16514.16 - 16516.16] P:1692.30 E:0.105609 |  But remember, he is contracted until December,
[16516.16 - 16521.16] P:1597.56 E:0.099257 |  so I think the next question would be whether he does stay on for those extra months
[16521.16 - 16527.16] P:1596.36 E:0.098687 |  depending on whether England are in a position,
[16527.16 - 16530.16] P:1637.20 E:0.106049 |  the FA are in a position to bring in his successor.
[16530.16 - 16533.16] P:1463.91 E:0.103638 |  But my feeling would be pretty much like everyone else
[16533.16 - 16537.16] P:1585.58 E:0.092614 |  that he feels that this was the last chapter of the story.
[16538.16 - 16540.16] P:1735.98 E:0.111508 |  John, thank you very much.
[16540.16 - 16544.16] P:1796.68 E:0.100879 |  More reaction throughout the night and on the football daily pod.
[16544.16 - 16549.16] P:1924.97 E:0.104008 |  It's another Euros done, it's another Euros that ends in disappointment
[16549.16 - 16551.16] P:1868.31 E:0.094844 |  for England's men.
[16551.16 - 16557.16] P:1929.12 E:0.101315 |  Tournaments like this are no easy feat to organise, produce and engineer.
[16557.16 - 16562.16] P:1894.93 E:0.100049 |  So to all of our teams who have helped do that for those of us on air over the last month,
[16562.16 - 16564.16] P:1895.33 E:0.086613 |  thank you very much.
[16564.16 - 16568.16] P:1798.36 E:0.094565 |  But there is no trophy lift for England's men and the wait goes on.
[16568.16 - 16572.16] P:1772.68 E:0.097569 |  606 is next here on Five Live from Berlin.
[16572.16 - 16573.16] P:1858.98 E:0.058641 |  Good night.
