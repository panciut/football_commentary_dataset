  "transcript": " Central defenders, Toloibre, Bernucci and Achebe, then Di Lorenzo on the right, Di Marco on the left, Giorgio Ginho with Varela and Cristante, then Raspidori and Scamica of West Ham, and the England side tonight, Nick Pope, Walker, Dyer and Maguire, James Rice, Bellingham and Saka, Foden, Sterling and Kane. There was a lovely touch when the national anthem was being played, that the huge screen on the opposite side of the ground showed an image of Queen Elizabeth tinged in black and we will have a minute's silence before the game. Respectfully observed and the Italians also wearing black armbands tonight and on the subject of armbands as you might be aware the one love armband is being won by Harry Kane for the first time tonight and he will be wearing it in catap as well along with the captains of nine other European nations. So it is Italy against England, you're with us here live in Milan at San Siro, England are going to play from left to right in the first half with these new white shirts with the blue shoulder trim, blue shorts, white socks, there's the whistle from the Spanish referee, Jesus Kiel Manzanoff and England play it straight back to Eric Dyer who gets his first touch in international football for almost two years, Rice heads it forward towards Sterling and the referee spotted an infringement and it's a great kick to Italy who are wearing all as Uri Blue, the Savoy Blue of Italy, loved the way that they all swayed together, the team while the anthem was being sung. So Italy in possession the ball played away from the back towards the halfway line, Kyle Walker wins the header, Harry Kane gets a touch on that, it's been chased by Foden and the pass back to Donoromak is forced but the big man, the player of the tournament at the Euros is able to clear it away left footed but England back in possession on the halfway line. For those who've just switched on, Matt Upsham, just a word on how you feel about this team that's been picked by Garrett Southgate tonight. I'm excited about it, John, looking at it when I rode it down and looked at the formation and started to picture how they're going to play. I think it's a really exciting team, I mean Declan Rice has started really sharply in the midfield, won an early header, snapped into a tackle, I think the players are going to be really on the front foot in this game. Italy nil, England nil, three kick to England on the halfway line, a foul on Phil Foden, just a high foot on him that came in from Tristanse, so three kick to England. The Minutas-Salons by the way also remembering the victims of the recent flood in Italy which killed at least 10 people and England take the free kick, square and actually go back into their own half back to Eric Dyer. So here is a first touch for the Manchester United captain Harry Maguire, they'll be great, scrutiny on how he fares tonight out on the far side, left side of the central defensive three, plays it back into Dyer and then back to Walker and Flail Walker is pointing to Eric Dyer but goes back to Nick Paulp who gets his first touch or just the one cap for him last season but his first match, England's first match as a with him as a Newcastle United player and he's in the team so a big night for Nick Paulp as well tonight than the England goal match. Yeah I think he's got a show that is composed and calm enough with the ball at his feet, I think he's had a really good season so far, great with his hands and climbing crosses, a big lad but having the ball at the feet is where he's got to really improve at. Nice from Scamaca in the centre circle, Borralla now with some space but he over hits the pass, that is way over the head of DiMarco, the blonde head, the dyed blonde head DiMarco and it's out for a thrill to England, 10 yards away from their own corner flag which is taken by James back to Walker, long right footed ball from him looking for Kane but it comes off the head, an Italian head and through to Benucci who's winning his 117th cap tonight, the great Leonardo Benucci of Juventus which means that he is now equal with the equally great Giorgio Chiellini and Benucci sends this pass downfield and Maguire in a poor position and the shot from Raspidori is saved by Paulp down to his right but actually the offside flag was up and if Raspidori had been able to find the net it wouldn't have counted but that was uncertain from Maguire. Yeah he was just really trying to claw him back, I don't think he quite saw the run of Raspidori until it was too late and Harry Maguire just got the wrong side, yes Linesman's got his flag up so he's offside but just a little early warning shot you know when you're not really that tuned in in terms of game ready and having played week in week out it's going to take a little bit of time just to get that awareness and distance right. That's a let-off for Harry Maguire, yeah I mean yes he was offside so it wouldn't have stood but you know if it had been valid you know what the marital would have been and now here is Raspidori again on the edge of the penalty area but Rice was quickly across to block the shot and the ball ricocheted away out of play for a throw in down the left hand side near the corner flag. It will be uncertain from Rhys James and Karl Walker there, they've had a couple of words so far, Karl Walker really remonstrate and I just I think it's too often that those two players have maybe played together in that kind of situation but I think he's looking for for Rhys James to get a little bit higher up the pitch and be a little bit more progressive and look forward with the ball. To Marco River, cross towards the back post and the back post header from Scammercat was pushed away by Tope it was going in you know and he's got a hand to it and made a push it onto the crossbar and it was scrambled behind for a corner. Well great run and leap from Scammercat, this is exactly what he's all about, big target man good in the air, gets up really well, he has a run on Harry Maguire who's backfelling and I don't even know if he realises he's going to come and head that ball there, Harry Maguire, he's had a really difficult opening period in this game. Scammercat has yet to score for Italy, this is his eighth cap, here's the corner, it comes in, Benucci swings the leg, it was up at waist high, missed it though, Maguire was there, another cross comes in from the left hand side from DeMarco, it takes a flick of a head driven back across, only half cleared by Saka and now it is volleyed away, volleyed away to comparative safety by Harry Kane who is back there inside the penalty area. What a cross it was from DeMarco though on the left hand side. Well it's just the type of ball that you know you can cross when you have a player like Scammercat in the box, I mean his movement was good, he just peeled onto that back post area, he had one or two strides on Harry Maguire who was backfelling and he just didn't really get off the ground, Harry Maguire and Scammercat really got up high and above him, he's a good head up, decent save from Pope. Well Harry Maguire's got a lot of improving to do, if the early stages are anything to go behind here, Scammercat now, the West Hand man takes it on and shoots from, well best part of 30 yards and he had options ahead of him to his right and to his left but he went for goal. And there's a lot of space, a couple of times now Scammercat has dropped into that area and there's not a centre back that's gone with him and that is the, you know one of the things I thought when I saw the selection is playing Dyer and Maguire together, it was quite an interesting selection from Garry Southgate because they're both a little bit similar in kind of the way they play and move and just a couple of times maybe more reluctant to want to go all the way in tight and leave that space in behind. If you're wondering John Stones is suspended, he was sent off against Hungary on that forgettable night for England, forgettable but in many ways unforgettable. England's heaviest home defeat for almost a century and they've got a lot of improving to do themselves as a team after what happened that day. He has Walker for England, turns and plays it back to Nick Poulth who's already had to make that one save, now passes it out to Walker, will also be looking to see Nick Poulth playing in the absence of the injured Jordan Pickford, what his footwork is like, he is such a good shot stopper probably in the form of his career. I spoke to him earlier this week Nick Poulth as Italy play the ball out from the back, DiMarco up towards Walker though for England, lifts a high one forward towards Harry Kane who pulls it down against Georginho, Tottenham and Chelsea there and then it goes back from the edge of the area from a chair-beat to the huge figure of the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Donnarumma. Now there was a suggestion that he might get a hostile welcome Donnarumma because of the way that he left AC Milan who of course played our home matches here at San Siro and I did notice some whistles there from the crowd for the home goalkeeper when he had a touch of the ball. Here's Jude Bellingham sent a field but he shoved over, challenge from Raspidori for the Raspidori, sent Jude Bellingham down to free kick, the home fans didn't like that. No not at all just caught him from behind Raspidori but Jude Bellingham looking to make those runs from midfield, when the ball gets played wide into the wing back area Bellingham is generally the player who's on on the move looking to get in that space, drive forwards with the ball, something that England needs to do better in this game. England with a ball inside their own heart, Italy nil, England nil. Choice of listening tonight by the way the Bath-Wasks Premiership match is over on Sports Extra on your digital radio via BBC Sounds. Sterling allows the ball to pass through his legs, Kane was looking to run on to it but it's tidied up by Benucci who turns it back to Donnarumma, there are definitely whistles for the Italian goalkeeper, it was rather acrimonious the way that he left, Italy played forward but Gair is able to step forward and heads away, the attempted pass forward by Barella, Bellingham gets the ball back, awkward bouncing so he gives it to Sacher on the far side who takes it down, Declan Rice is there back, it goes to McGuire and McGuire is just going to knock it across the England penalty area to the man all in yellow, short sleeved yellow shirt, Nick Polk who passes it back to the Manchester United captain Harry McGuire who has lost his place in the Manchester United Premier League starting line up and now Italy have the ball back on the right hand side played forward by Di Lorenzo, now blue shirt four and four, here's the cross but far too close to Nick Polk, he's there to make a routine catch into his mid-riff. Interesting start in the game isn't it, Italy really pressing high whenever the ball's loose and England player gets on it in their own half, there's a swarm of blue shirts really trying to win it back straight away but England not quite hit their stride yet in terms of with the ball, the confidence and the passing, you can tell that they've got more intensity about them but just that little bit of belief and quality and hopefully just come into their game. That was interesting as well, that last Italian move involving Toloi who's playing as a right-sided central defender and Di Lorenzo, the Toloi can play as a right back and the two of them working well together, Di Lorenzo, the Napoli captain and Toloi of Atalanta, England coming forward though and winning a free kick fell on Sterling halfway inside the Italian half. Well this is an area as well when you look at the team selection we've got good headers of the ball in the team, you've got targets like Dyer and Maguire, Harry Kane and I think set pieces is something that could be a real strength of England's. Well let's see, it's going to be Foden to take this, the Manchester City man, from, it'll be 35 yards out given the angle over towards the left hand side, England, Kane making movement towards the penalty spot in it comes from Foden, Bellingham stuck out a leg, it's cleared away by Di Marco, comes back for Foden, Foden goes through one challenge, Sterling in the box, takes it out into the full back position and then Sterling, little ball in field, Bellingham stretches, gives it to his midfield partner Rice and now back again on the left hand side to Raheem Sterling, Sterling winning his 78th cap tonight, the most capped player in this England starting line-up, Sterling with it again, his first match for England as a Chelsea man, right foot ball into the box and there's a back post header actually from Harry Maguire who is still up there, he was under pressure, he managed to head it on target but it was an easy catch really, it just dropped into the clubs of Donnarumma. Yeah I like the way he stayed up there, Harry Maguire didn't just drop back into his centre back position, Raheem Sterling got his head up on the left hand side, shifted it onto his right foot, saw Maguire and just thought a chip of all over to that back post area and Harry Maguire like he said won the header but it's a good challenge from the Italian defender that just didn't allow him a clean contact. Yeah so it just dropped very gently into the clubs of Donnarumma, looked like he was catching a tennis ball didn't it with those great big clubs at his, such a huge man all in red tonight which I think makes him look even bigger, 11 minutes played, 12 minutes played now, Italy nil, England and England playing it out from the back, England lose tonight they will be relegated from this group to the second tier of the nation's league but a draw and they were still just about being with a chance of avoiding that ignominie, England with the ball on the left hand side inside the Italian heart. Sharp into the tackle at the moment Italy, really are you know when the ball's any second ball there's a lot of flat out running commitment trying to get to the ball tackling, winning anything that's dropping in that midfield area. Well they made a strong start, Italy those, the crosses from the left hand side from DiMarco, you mentioned it to us before the game Matt, you know that's a real threat that they have but England in possession in the centre circle with Eric Gaiac just gets the ball back, puts his foot on it, last time he played for England it was also in this back three with Walker to his right and Maguire to his left in the November of 2020 that's a pure ball across from Reis, beyond Walker and it's out of play for a throw on the halfway lane, he's better than that. He is, puts his hand up in acknowledgement to his teammate to say yep that one's on me but I'm liking the look of Eric Dyer on the ball in the middle of that three John Stirling does well, wins the ball centre field, takes it onto the edge of the box gives it to right side of the area, Kane goes for the shot it's deflected up in the air forward and jumping for it but Italy are able to clear and get it towards Scamica on the halfway line, Bellingham puts in the challenge but Reis is able to cut out the attempted forward pass and now Harry Kane in some space 30 yards out, Kane goes past Giorgino in into the box and then there is a final line of defence in Toloi but they haven't cleared it and Bellingham was very nearly onto that but the ball ran to DeMarco just outside the penalty area in Italy do come forward, Barela now but Barela over hits the pass, Gronz from the home supporters and Nick Paul has got the ball. That's the second time Barela has hit that ball, signalling to Scamica, he wants him to peel out, he wants him to come wide as opposed to to central but I mean if moment of the go is I think it was just taken off Jude Bellingham's toe wasn't it by Cristante, just got a toe on the ball I felt Bellingham was really going to get there if he won that ball his first touch was into that kind of D on the edge of the box and it was a certain shooting opportunity. Italy Nail, England Nail, it's Matthew Upsen with us here on Five Live inside the San Siro, Matt who played for England at the World Cup and in eight weeks time Matt will be there, eight weeks today it'll be the week before the World Cup, England will be there and we will bring you comprehensive coverage, the usual service that you would expect from a World Cup on BBC Radio Five Live. Sterling is challenged on the halfway line by Tolloi and now he has Raspidori and the 22 year old Raspidori turns infield and gives it to Barela on the right hand side, Saka just came across in court his ankles he went down it's a free kick to Italy in a good position out to the right near the corner of the penalty area. Yes definitely a foul from Bacchio Saka just hung his leg out well he was recovering back into position but again the ball given away by Raheem Sterling really nice progressive pass from Eric Dyer I think it was into his feet but England just aren't quite clicking in their passing and movement and support at that moment he's going into the front and they're not really seeing that pass just to offload the ball and the Italians are really getting around them quickly. Free kick on the right so Raspidori is there but also DiMarco has gone across as well those green boots of his green boots blonde hair and he'll be looking to whip this in with his left foot so it'll be dipping into Nick Pope. England have just got a one-man wall Saka forward and is standing three or four yards to the right so Nick Pope has got a good line of sight on this it is DiMarco actually leaves it for Raspidori it's a routine and then it comes back again to DiMarco who does eventually take it it was like something out of the May Day celebrations there I thought it was round and round the the May poll almost like a bit of acting it was like nothing to do with me oh yep now I'm gonna take it DiMarco ran round the ball past the ball then Raspidori ran up to the ball stopped and DiMarco continued his run around in a circle and then hit it in they've won a corner after all of that 0-0 the score five life from the BBC corner from the right hand side here it is it's an out swing at the words the back post and the referee says I think it went did it go out of play before it curled back in or did he spot a push in there it's not entirely clear too short I think it may have been an infringement yeah because it's going to be taken the free kick between the six yard box and the edge of the penalty area so Italy nil England nil um just over quarter runnel a play what have you thought so far that's I think England looked much fresher bit brighter you can see the intent of what they want but just that that quality and the the timing of the movement and the support when the ball goes forward has to be right just there Pope again with a pass just too many misplaced passes at the moment that was um too close for comfort that pass out from Nick Pope just past Raspidori but we've seen a few of those haven't we you know all over the pitch it is ninth captain I think Pope as I say so far in his previous eight caps he's conceded just the one goal that was when England won against Poland and actually it was a it was a poor ball out if you remember when Nick Pope played at the John Stones and Jakob Morda scored for Poland in that qualifier that England eventually won 2-1 Italy nil England nil Bellingham has fouled on the halfway line we've got a name for the soprano Matt you'll be very excited it was Carly Paula Carly Pauly who was the the wonderful singer of the Italian and indeed the England national anthem go back on sounds and hear it again it was incredible here is Reese James James being put under pressure by Di Marco but Kyle Walker was there as a second line of defense and it finds its way back to Eric Dyer in the middle of the England half as they come out Maguire is again peeled right over there to the left hand side but he's quickly closed down by Borella so has to come by Scamaker so has to come back in field to Eric Dyer forward from him Phil Forden just gets away from him but James was there and gives it back to Phil Forden such an important player for England for Garis Southgate England team Phil Forden he needs to get the best out of him and he's not scored in his last 13 appearances for England Phil Forden here's Harry Kane on the far side he is challenged he is fouled by Benucci and it is a free kick to England seven or eight yards inside the Italian half in the other match in this group the leaders Hungary have taken the lead in Leipzig against Germany Adam Shalli has scored and it is Germany 0 Hungary 1 goal in the 17th minute England trying to find a pass through to Saka that is intercepted but England have got it back now Saka is it distilling but it comes to challenge on him from Toloi and then Declan Rice slides in and advances out of play in the end for what is given as an England throw referee says the final touches off Borelli he doesn't like that palms apart shaking his head towards the Spanish referee but England take the throw it's very honest from Borella to stay on his feet there Declan Rice comes sliding in doesn't get a piece of the ball at all maybe just a tiny slice of it but not enough to to suggest that he wins the ball and Borelli just manages to almost don't know how he does it actually just misses the contact from Declan Rice he really went to ground and threw everything at that challenge he caught man and not ball yeah that was red card territory but he didn't so uh England in possession inside their own half passing it back to Nick Taub Italy Nell England Nell Taub long ball from him on this occasion but it's right under the chest of Toloi wearing the number four tonight they do wear these golden numbers on their shirts the blue shirts the the Italians the European champions as we cannot forget that they are European champions but have failed to qualify for the World Cup and indeed have failed now to qualify for the last two World Cups. Gareth Southgate just watching down there on the edge of the coaching area he's going for a chocolate brown suit tonight I notice on fashion week in Milan the ball comes back to Walker who turns it to Pope inside the penalty area Pope delays and then plays it long towards Stirling but he's beaten in the air by Toloi and Italy come again but passes somewhere behind DeMarco and it bounces out of play for a throw in to uh to England they're not really building up too much from the back Italy are they it's all very much reactive in terms of turnover winning the ball and then trying to find those passes as quick as they can and catch England out is England really who are having a lot more time on the ball at the back across their back three Eric Dyer seen a lot of the ball so far in this game. Italy Nell England Nell is the score with just over 20 minutes on the clock James scooping the ball forward for Bellingham who's made a run forward gets the ball down under pressure from Benucci think Benucci just had a little word with Reese James off the ball there I don't know what that was about Bellingham now on the right hand side Belling drops his shoulder goes left then goes right gives it to James and then Reese James passing it back towards Kyle Walker who goes to Eric Dyer in the centre circle he's got a kind of it's like a reddish streak in his yeah Reese James yeah reminds me of Dickie Davis world of sport many many years ago what's another one fashion week they're all at it here's Dyer and then Walker goes back to the edge of the penalty area it's actually quite a throwback to see two managers in suits yeah you're very very rarely see that these days I suppose Garo Southgate knowing it's Mancini knowing that it is fashion week Mancini very light gray suit to be the softest Italian wool no doubt as he sets off and sits down on his seat England playing the ball inside their own half not really going anywhere but that's good from Gordon to Bellingham and now down the right hand side to James and Kane's waiting in the middle and here's the cross from James but it's cut out that the knee opposed by a chair he doesn't go out of play it's hiked away by DiMarco and then Bellingham puts in the challenge and it's out for a throw to Italy halfway inside their own half a pause from Garo Southgate down there for that well that's the move that I think's on all day if England managed to get three or four passes off and maneuver that space Rhys James in behind there with his pace is on all day I mean a chairby's not going to want to come out of that area and try and deal with that he's in the box he just gets his cross wrong Rhys James it's kind of in between takes it really early you need to whip that across the face in between Donnarumma and the Italian defenders would have caused the problem but he just doesn't get the right contact on the cross. Scamica is fouled by Dianne of the halfway line so that's a free kick it's interesting here James Horncastle suggesting that if Tiro and Morbillet of Lazio had been fit then it would have been a back four tonight and basically because he's injured they've changed the system. I can totally see that I mean it when we got the team we looked at it and it was very much raised eyebrows as the first time he's played a back three as it as the Italian manager isn't it I think he said so that just shows you how unusual it is. Good from Kane in the centre circle gives it to Foden Foden now nicely rolls the pass to the left hand side to Sterling Sterling now into the pan of the area but two Italians challenge and then Sterling also puts in the challenge in the referee who's just a few yards away so that was a foul on Borrella who went down like a flash but it was a foul yeah disputed by Sterling but it's a free kick to Sterling. Well Borrella really got got his work done early then got in from a midfield position to support Gugginio and Rahim Sterling was it just didn't really make his mind up early enough how he wanted to offload that ball there were two Italian players he wasn't going to go past both of them and just got the ball caught under his feet. As I say the Friday night premiership match is on Sports Extra the score currently Bath Nill Wasps 11 and in the United rugby championship Glasgow 7 Cardiff 7 and Lenster 14 Benetton 3 are later scores. Italy Nill England Nill that's a reminder that it is a Friday night here in Milan and indeed everyone else as the ball is played back to Donnarumma inside the penalty area passes it out to Bonucci famously scorer of the equalising goal at Wembley on that unforgettable night for many many reasons at Wembley last year and then Borrella over hits that pass again for no that was Georgino let him off it was Georgino he hit that pass downfield way beyond anyone in a blue shirt so England have got it back Nill Nill. Yes interesting with with Scamica he's held the ball up really well when he's come into him but I just got quite on the same wavelength as the midfield players at the moment in terms of the movement is making a couple of times I've expected him to go somewhere and he's gone in the opposite direction or drop deep when he they thought he was going to go long it's not quite awkward from pulp inside the penalty area with the ball gave it to Dyer he did not look comfortable at all but England have been able to survive that and Rice is carrying the ball away he was being fouled there but England are still coming forward so the advantage has been played Foden now still inside his own half Foden moving from right to left gets it back from Maguire Foden still going low towards Saka but as he peeled away it just took a touch with his right instep that showed it to Italy and now Italy are coming forward on the half way line Tristante finds the ball to the right hand side to Borrella and Borrella's ball into the middle oh that's a poor touch by Raspidori near the penalty spot slightly awkward for him but his first touch it bounced well away from him in England cleared and that was a let-off well Saka was high and narrow when he gave the ball away that reaction from that position when you're playing Wimbach has to be quicker to get back in position because that whole left side was open Italy work it wide there and very nearly created a goal scoring opportunity still goalless here in the Giuseppe Miata Germany 0 hungry 1 there's the latest score in Leipzig and the other match in the group and later we'll have news of the tennis the big night for Roger Federer tonight playing his final match before retirement playing in the doubles at the Labour Cup Ruffel Fuller will join us to tell us more about that later here is Giorgio Gigno Giorgio Gigno low ball through the middle to Raspidori telling him in with the tackle on him got more of man than he did of ball and that's given us a free kick around about halfway between the centre circle and the edge of the England penalty area it's a bad challenge from from Bellingham in the sense that it's given a free kick away and a dangerous area didn't need to go out and commit himself Raspidori was always going to have his body in between Bellingham and the ball just looking at the replay of his touch there Raspidori just he had just controlled that with his left foot off that cross it was a real good goal scoring opportunity some more news on Carly Pauli in a minute or two so uh brace yourself for that impressed by that John wouldn't you yeah but first Italy have got this free kick that Raspidori plays out to the right hand side Barella though was quickly closed down by Fordon so he had to give it back to DiMarco groans you can hear the groans from the Italian supporters they wanted that delivered in to Scamaca and that's what DiMarco is looking to do now towards the back post it's pulled back but then Harry Kane was actually in position to to cut out the ball that was volleyed back from the dead ball line by DiLorenzo and the England captain was able to clear it it's still nil nil England's penultimate match before the World Cup Italy playing the ball out towards the right hand side DiLorenzo's onto this and then Napoli captain was able to look for support out there from Barella and then he gets it back but England are forcing him back towards the halfway line and he plays it to the captain that fluorescent green armband Leonardo Benucci. It's certainly got the feel of both teams not quite being at their best hasn't it you know in terms of the quality the pass just in a pass here from the Tristan team perfectly illustrated by the pass from Tristan to get it out of his feet long diagonal I mean it's not particularly difficult passing for a player of his quality and he bashes it straight out into touch and we've seen quite a lot of those instances two or three times he's gone up to Raheem Sterling he's not got hold of the ball it's bounced off him or he's tried to play it first time around the corner and got it wrong and the quality in this game hasn't quite lived up to the opening. The game's really being played mainly between the penalty areas yeah so we've seen the the header from Scamica the back post header that was saved by Pope I think he pushed it up onto the crossbar we've not seen it again here's DiMarco now down the left hand side dangerous again swings the ball in but it comes off James who's only seven or eight yards away and it's behind for what is a corner to Italy from the left hand side this time for England really there's only that Harry Maguire header I think that's it isn't it promising stuff around the edge of the penalty area but it's not no chances really no so a corner for DiMarco to take and he stepped back up the line and then swings it in left foot a bit straight into the gloves of Nick Pope who caught the ball it stuck to his gloves like balloons. He can swing a ball in can't he DiMarco it's got it's got the swerve and that dip as well he hits it quite I don't know kind of kind of flat it's got quite a unique style but he really does get plenty of swerve on the ball difficult to to judge. One of the new internationals made his first appearances in the nation's league in June so this is his fifth cab and this is his home ground plays for Inter does the left back left wing back Federico DiMarco. England with Stirling who goes down and wins the free kick but this is seven or eight yards inside the penalty area it was Toloi who is tight on Stirling but down he went and won the free kick and England played short his Foden Foden followed all the way by Achirby the central defender who now drops back into position as England crossed the halfway line Declan Rice black hair bobbin Stirling now with his white shirt outside these very dark blue shorts goes back to Eric Dyer in the centre circle Dyer looks up Dyer goes long but that's too long for England and Don Gerome just holds out an arm and taps the ball down and still no no I liked it I think it was on and he signaled with his hand to Raheem Stirling and he he put his head in his hands after Dyer because I think he knows he could have hit that ball with the right weight he just over hit it by about 10 yards but he's got the quality just to drop that ball in there it was a straight ball and a straight run which is quite unusually but the space was there between I think it's Toloi and Benucci so Italy playing the ball out from the back it's just in front of their own penalty area played out to Toloi on the right hand side but back it comes to Benucci and Carly Pauly Matt was actually born and raised in Mansfield but her mother's family are from the Elecce so she had the proverbial foot in both caps and boy did she take advantage of that that was the opera singer who sang the anthems before the game Italy Nill England Nill it's been it has been the highlight of the night so far because it's an interesting match but it is not full of thrills and spills no not that's a poor touch as well by by a cheer being the ball bounces out for a throw to England not when you see it on paper and I think you're looking at paper to think oh yeah this this could be quite a good run high quality I know Italy have got a lot of players out but yeah it's not quite lived up to the standards in terms of passing and touch quality so far Walker playing the ball back to Dyer seem an awful lot of the ball on his England return Eric Dyer 46th cap tonight here's Maguire now receiving it on the left hand side and you see Phil Foulden's dropping deeper and deeper all the time to get the ball and try and influence the match and now Sterling doing the same thing as well actually coming back into his own half at England ended up going back to Nick Pope yeah well they're both quite well matched up aren't they in terms of formations and Italy as we said touched on earlier out of possession have been really pressing they've been really getting after England anything in the midfield scammer cut is getting for a lot of work in that front line Roberto Mancini has actually gone with a 5 3 2 which you do not often see these days no Sterling is challenged but that is very tight there very tight the marking from Tolloy on Sterling the ball still in play on the far side and De Lorenzo has got to be careful and Sterling is quickly on to him and Sterling's won a free kick after De Lorenzo with it with a heavy touch there wins the free kick and England have it on the left hand side and when I say it's 5 3 2 Raspidori is either up alongside Scammercourt or he's then dropping very quickly back into the midfield isn't he yeah he's playing to it I think when you play as a centre forward like Scammercourt probably does make sense to play one up alongside him because he's going to hold the ball up really well with knockdowns flick-ons and to have a player running off him could be a real asset free kick wide on the left but England have sent the big man up and here is the delivery from Thornton in towards the penalty spot Kane got his head to it but glanced it across the box it comes out to James who shoots and the deflection takes it right across the penalty area I think it shook your corner we had a great view of that yeah actually we saw that it took a touch off an Italian leg or body on its way behind but the referee didn't have that angle no and he's guessed basically he has guessed it's given a goal kick I like the fact that I think it was a Christanti put his foot out and it clearly just came off a bit you know significant deflection off of him but I like the way that Rhys James had his first touch and wanted to to shoot in that situation we've seen him hit balls from that area of the pitch before and be really successful scored some really good goals from just outside the box Rhys James yes he has not scored for England yet this is his 14th cap but it's Matt's six goals for Chelsea last season Italy nail England nail England could really do with winning this game and they certainly can't afford to lose it otherwise they'd be relegated for the second tier of the nation's league Bellingham as England have it on the right hand side into Kane Kane plays it into Benuccio and there is Shins and it bounces behind and this is a corner for England their first of the match yeah I didn't quite want to miss Benuccio there really Harry Kane there was enough distance between them Benuccio came out and tried to block the most obvious angle across the box but I thought Kane maybe just going to pull that one back a little bit onto the penalty spot area for any England player arriving in the box Rhys James has come across to take this corner this is at the end where the England fans are right up near the the spotlight under the roof a good couple of thousand of them up there with the flags James takes the corner it's headed by Dyer across the box cleared by Italy comes out to Foden nice footwork it's played by Maguire back out to James James Cross is intercepted by the outstretched left foot of DiMarco and that is behind for another England corner good from England yeah lovely little lift of the ball from Phil Foden he had his touch it was so tight no space a tour and an Italian player came out and he just lifted the ball over his feet lovely got him behind him and then another cross from Rhys James it was blocked so a second almost second consecutive corner from the right James raises his right arm and it goes to the near post Rhys tries to flick it it's blocked by the man behind him and then it's sort of hiked back in by Bellingham but it was a bouncing effort and it just bounced through harmlessly to Donna Rummer and Italy looked to play it away quickly oh and that's Harry Maguire putting in the challenge on Barela but he got the ball committed himself got the ball and put it out only just I mean Barela came from the wrong side of him didn't he Harry Maguire already kind of launched himself into the sliding challenge and just got there before Barela literally at the same time as uh England now could open up here for Sterling four to the centre circle Sterling absolutely rattles it onto the chest of Kane who did well to control that but then the attempted past James was cut out by DiMarco and Italy now come forward with purpose Scammercat back to Barela Rhys is with him though so just checks his progress and then Christante receives it from him in England a very quickly back in position behind the ball nil nil the score five life from the BBC on a Friday night five life sport tomorrow the headline act tomorrow commentary on the grand final the St. Helens Leeds grand final from six o'clock but we also have commentary tomorrow on the Arsenal Topham game in the women's super league as the balls played over the top for Italy and it comes back to the edge of the box the initial intention was Scammercat there but it came back to Christante on the edge of the area he tried it an effort but that was blocked on the edge of the area and England were able to clear it to the halfway line Italy take up possession again though here is Giorgio and he gets it back in the centre circle turns the full 360 degrees and actually a little bit more than that and then now finds a chairby and the central defenders left footed crosses headed down and away by Dyer and then Nick Puld is able to clear it after it was tapped back to him by Rhys James still nil nil but Declan Rice putting in the challenge centre field Italy on the move again with Christante forward to Raspidori and then Christante finds Kyle Walker arriving so Italy go back to Toloi again now here is Giorgio Giorgio squared at Christante Rice puts in the challenge and that means that England have been able to get it back and clear the halfway line but Italy take possession again and England just on the back foot at the moment Matt Upton. Scammercat can't get hold of the ball I mean it's been what we've touched on the pass it hasn't been up to the level for me in this game from England has been too many misplaced passes not enough assurance when they're moving the ball and Italy just keep winning the ball back and then getting back in possession having their spells it's really like you say they've been played very much in the central area of the pitch and not a lot of penalty box action in this game. No there's no and it was an issue lack of goals put it very simply in those matches in the Nations League in June just the one penalty in Munich from Harry Kane and created so little when you consider that they scored the 39 goals in the group which was a record in a qualifying group for England but against the better opposition that's the concern England have struggled in the Nations League to create chances Italy coming forward trying to create chances of their own but it's cleared away by Dyer and then folding his box and it's a free kick to England. The photo just using his body well gets between the ball and a chair beat I think it is he's gone all the way up the pitch from the left side centre back position to win the win the foul but England just not really gelling in terms of movement and passing it has to be said it's just that that's the key for me in this game any piece of quality when they have got three or four passes off they've created something there's been a bit of space there's then been a runner they're not short in in running energy are there when you look up likes of Walker James Bellingham Sacker all in kind of midfield or defensive roles there's so much energy in this team if they just get the passing going on they can really create something they have to use the old phrase cancelled each other out Sterling to Kane just forward of the centre circle Foulden gives it back to Kane now here's James on the right-hand side James into the box now puts his foot on the ball drags it back still going Reese James he's got Kyle Walker behind him Walker takes a touch and then plays the ball through tried to thread it through the gap for James to run on to the walkers pass was overhead and it's a goal kick and it comes to nothing and I think Reese James ever really wanted that pass in there Walker wanted to play that ball it was the most aggressive pass that straight ball in behind the fallback but Reese James never really committed to that run and it was always going to run out of play so it remains Italy Nail England Nail official figure incidentally is 4451 England fans are here and they've brought probably over a hundred England flags across the St George up there in the in the gobs Italy coming for it Tristan he plays it across but it's behind Scamaca Toloi now joins the attack but Sterling went with him and England have been able to win the ball back from Italian from Toloi and Saka gives it to Harry Kane and Harry Kane runs from the centre circle and Kane shoots but it whizzes away over the top of the crossbar by four or five yards well for one of the first times in this game the Italians really did commit themselves forward and leave himself a bit open at the back Harry Kane is just traveling with the ball and I think he thought they're just going to keep backing off I'm going to hit one but it's always harder for me to hit the ball to get that clean strike when the ball's rolling away from you at pace and he was always stretching for the strike and the ball was always rising so it is still Nail Nail Nail goes down and that's a free kick to England half inside the Italian half yes Harry Kane doesn't score too many goals from outside of the penalty area for England I remember the one in Warsaw that was a cracking goal the late goal in Warsaw a couple of years ago but it's a free kick now England have already had one from this sort of position Folden's going to take this from the left hand side so again Italy are holding their line three or four yards outside of the penalty area down to our right Folden waiting over there one foot slightly in front of the other up goes the right arm here's the delivery from Folden looking for rice but I think Benucci got his head to it first and the ball bounces out of play and the referee says is he giving a free kick Eric Dyer has run towards the referee on his way back to the halfway line or did he just give the goal I think it's for a shove sure if you had his in the back I think it's a free kick for a shove but good delivery into the box the Italians defended it well Benucci Declan rice was kind of between Benucci and and Tolloi Benucci just won that ball but it's for a shove on the edge of the box I think so it's still nil nil the official attendance has come through which is 50,640 which is swelled by as I say almost four and a half thousand England fans but that means that it's sort of getting towards two-thirds full the San Siro so we can see lots of the coloured seats empty around the place as England with Walker played out to James but DeMarco is able to get the challenge in and then Walker DeMarco is there with him DeMarco saying the final touch was off Walker which took it behind but referee Manzano says no goal kick England's it's been a little bit uncertain this right hand side isn't it Walker and James have not really been on the same wavelength with the ball it's hard to kind of see where that that's heading at the moment I mean James is pulling quite wide but they're a little bit on top of each other and whether or not there's not quite the same support because on the other side Sack has come and really narrowed into that position more so and James is staying wide on this side Foden's a little bit higher than him they're just a little bit on that same line up and down this right hand side and need to come off the angle a little bit to create some space the crowd getting onto Nick Paul because he takes that goal kick and Benucci back headed to the goalkeeper at the other end nil nil so England in November those three group matches against Iran USA and then Wales so that is the 21st of November the 25th of November and the 29th of November and there is the halftime whistle here in September and it's nil nil at halftime and I think it deserves to be that upset yeah not quite the game I was picturing all member saying to you when I saw the team lines up I'm looking forward to this game this could be one of those real high quality matches but it hasn't been that and I think both teams you can't lack the willingness and and almost like that the endeavor that they're showing to want to be sharp to want to be on the front foot but that just hasn't been matched by the quality with the ball whether it's nerves whether it's a little bit of lack of confidence in the system or with each other who knows but it's not quite delivering what it should do at this stage at halftime no it is not and I think really it can only improve first half of very few chances and here in Milan at the break it is Italy nil England nil I think the excitement peaked pre-kickoff with the soprano singers isn't it John it all kind of went a bit downhill from there Carly was a real star yes I assume I should bring her on for the second half yeah and I there's got to be something in that just in the Garisouth gate does or says at halftime because Matt you said specifically about the passing in this England side and whether it was potentially an issue with confidence or nerves but that's a bit of a worry isn't it two months out for a well cut well I just think it's yeah that the quality hasn't been in the game I think it's been both sides to be honest but but England certainly haven't got hold of the ball and passed with the quality that we know they have I think Eric Dyer has has made a difference in that central road is but is very composed as comfortable with the ball and I think he's passed it pretty well but in terms of receiving skills in the midfield areas and higher up the pitch in terms of sacca and sterling it hasn't quite been at that level that you'd want because there's such impact players and they play so quickly when they're in sync and the touch is good and they'll play quickly round the corner one touch two touch and it's great to watch so you know it hasn't quite been there yet Matt John we'll be back with you with the second half shortly before we go to the news though let's bring in Everton winger Andros Townsend Andros would you make that 45? I think the boys covered most of it I think focusing on the positive really like the back three especially Eric Dyer that the way Matt touched on really composed really calm as a real figure communicating well with the two next to him he's the one who's looking to break lines forward always looking to get England's attack started and Declan Rice as well covering Akiah Sacher when he goes forward Sacher finds more natural midfield position as opposed to a wing back so there are positives obviously that watching that burst off there are a lot of things to work on as well I'm sure Carrefour and I'm sure we will break down those things after the break. Yes we will that does lead us nicely into the news we're going to be back with Andros shortly also dipping into a big night of tennis at London's O2 Arena and looking ahead to the Super League Grand Final but first let's get the news on 5Life Sport with Richard Foster. Listen on BBC Sounds this is BBC Radio 5 Live the Chancellor says his mini budget marks a new era for the British economy and he denies he's taking a gamble. Quasi Quarteng announced the biggest set of tax cuts for 50 years but there was no independent data to show how the measures will be paid for. Our political correspondent is Zoe Conway. There's also concern about whether this looks like too much of a reward for the rich we've got the former cabinet minister Julian Smith conservative saying that the cut to the tax for the very richest is he says wrong and so there's a real danger here that this idea that this is the billionaire's budget as as the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davy calls it that that charge will stick. Labour shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves says the Chancellor's plans will reward the already wealthy and won't help people struggling with rising prices. The Conservative MP Mal Stride chairs the Treasury Select Committee he told 5Life there should have been independent scrutiny from the office for budget responsibility. They certainly were able to do it there has been an argument well this all happened very quickly and therefore the OBR wouldn't have had time to have done all the work necessary well that really doesn't stack up because I wrote as chair of the committee to the head of the OBR a while ago and asked if he was ready to provide a forecast for any fiscal event that may occur in September and the answer was broadly yes we're ready. That concern was reflected in the value of shares and of sterling the pound sank to a new 37 year low against the dollar it's now trading at $1.09 to the pound the FTSE 100 index closed down nearly 2 percent. Other stories this evening and one of the bosses of Metta which owns Instagram has been giving evidence into the death of Molly Russell the 14 year old who killed herself after watching harmful videos online. Elizabeth Lagone says the question of why the children should be able to see images of suicide is a complicated issue and the RMT unions announced a 24 hour strike on Scott rail on Monday the 10th of October in a dispute about pay. The stopper shall follow three rail strikes across Britain on the 1st, the 5th and the 8th of October. Brand new drama on BBC iPlayer. Why didn't I appreciate ordinary life? How fragile it all was. You thought you were choosing your life. But actually you were just heading towards that moment. Starring Keely Hawes. Crossfire. Watch tonight on BBC iPlayer. Five life sport with Emma Thondas. So half time then it is goalless between Italy and England. The first half from England really lacking in spark and cohesion and quality. So lots to get into with Andrews Townsend again shortly. But firstly we'll bring you up to speed with sport elsewhere and in cricket and England's men completed a 63 run victory over Pakistan to lead 2-1 in the 7 match T20 series. Meanwhile, some of us have avoided relegation from Division 1 in the county championship. That is with victory over North Hans. On sports extra right now you can hear rugby union commentaries bath take on Wasps in the Gallagher Premiership where Wasps currently lead 31 points to 7. That is it half time. The Super League Grand Final takes place on Saturday with St Helens looking to win the competition for a full straight year. Standing in their way though are the leads Rhinos. We can hear now from the two head coaches going head to head at Old Trafford. Rowan Smith only took charge of leads in April with his side's second bottom of the Super League. However, he wouldn't be drawn on what if anything has changed since his arrival. It's really hard for me to make a judgment and accurate judgment on that because I like I don't know what was happening previous and you know I believe there was a lot of good things happening and there was a good roster and a good bunch of people but for whatever reason it just hadn't clicked and so I came in with you know open eyes and ready to be adaptable and listen and you know make some changes in some areas that I thought you know just suited me and my style but also that would suit our players as well. With the way that we played and also just the way things were around the environment so it's hard to say what's you know different to earlier in the year I've just guess I've tried to be myself and tried to be adaptable to the group I'm working with. And there's obviously a Smith thing going on here because I mean your uncle two leads to their first grand final win in something like 30 odd years and that was you know a revelation and what you've done here is a revelation. Have you spoken much to Uncle Tony this week? Not this week we've had a couple of messages and he sort of reminded me about enjoying the week and obviously he's been here and done that a lot so to have that reminder was a good one to to make sure you know enjoy it rather than you know stress too much about the yet potential outcome and just just enjoy the week and as we have done for the last few months it's been an enjoyable place to be and we've built a bit of momentum and there's a good vibe around and a belief in the group so it's good to have Tony there to have a chat too but yeah I think I just got to try and be myself that's the main thing. That was leads Rhinos head coach Ron Smith chatting to Dave Woods there. His counterpart tomorrow Christian Wolth takes charge of St Helens for the final time. It'll mark the end of a three-year stay that has seen his side win three successive super league grand finals now on the verge of an unprecedented fourth so will this one mean the most? They're all special they all come with challenges you know I think about how I felt after the 2021 I would have said that was the most special at that time I'm pretty sure and probably would have done the same last year and I've got no doubt I feel that way if we can get to that sort of result this weekend but I think we have had to overcome more challenges this year in different ways and we've had different challenges in 2020 and 2021 but there are more around off-field stuff whereas challenges this year have come on-field and you know not just the number of injuries or the number of suspensions the amount of chop and change but who those players have been as well and there've been some of the best players in the competition in their position and you know the guys we play without this week you know Al Worms, Lewis Dodd, Regan Grace, they're three players that will play in any team and you know make a big influence in any team and certainly make a big influence in a grand final and with Al Worms you've got a case there to say that he's one of the best in his position in the world not just in this competition as well so I think we have had to overcome you know some big obstacles this year and I've been really proud of how the group's gone about that and you know what makes them such a special group is the way they want to compete, the way they want to fight, the way they want to overcome adversity and that's what this year's been about and for those reasons the fact that we're here I'm extremely proud of the group and if we could go ahead and win it I think I would be more proud than other years and you know the other thing that I've got to add to that is it becomes a little bit harder every year to have that same fight, have that same hunger, the opposition get better and to get to where we are there's been a challenge in those ways as well and I'd be extremely proud that's for sure if we can go and lift the trophy at the end of it. And it's day one of the Lever Cup at the O2 Arena in London our tennis correspondent Russell Fuller is with us and Andy Murray is in action Russ but the main attraction still to come. Yes Roger Federer and Raphael Nadal teaming up to play doubles in what will be Federer's final match as a professional to come after Andy Murray against Alex Diminor and Murray for team Europe against Diminor for Team World has just taken the first set which lasted 81 minutes by seven games to five he's playing some wonderfully creative shots against the man who is the higher ranked player Alex Diminor just outside the world's top 20. The Lever Cup feed is currently providing pictures of that match and also they have a camera on the various team rooms and if you look at the European team room at least a few minutes ago you could have seen Raphael Nadal and Roger Federer sitting around the dining room table chatting in Federer by the looks of things enjoying a bowl of fruit salad. Wow what a group of players at the O2 Arena in London tonight it won't be much longer we can talk about all those names in the same sense it's certainly not competing against each other anyway so that's all the action and the latest from the Lever Cup at London's O2 Arena. Our focus though certainly until 10 o'clock this evening here on Five Live Sport is on the football England and Italy currently goalless in Milan at San Siro won't be long until we're back with our commentary team John Murray and Matt Upton but for the time bringing being let's bring back in Andros Townsend. Andros it does seem to be this lack of cohesion on the pitch doesn't there across the entire thing they're really struggling to stitch together certainly the attacking players they're likes to fold in they're really having to drop a bit deeper aren't they so what's the plan how do we get them more into the game? I think first and foremost that the two wingers folding sterling need to work better with Harry Kane if Harry Kane drops in like he likes to do we need runners in behind we need runners stretching the Italian back three so then Harry Kane can either drop off and get on the ball and get space and get turned or we can we can stretch them and get our our quick players in against their back three but I think our defensive third have done very well like I spoke about before the back three Declan Rice in particular in particular marshalling well that left hand side and Saka does get forward but needed just a bit more creativity a bit more freedom a bit more ideas not even in the final third but we're barely getting there in the middle third Do you sense nerves out there Matt said he seemed to sense it when he was watching on it in commentary but do you think that might be part of the problem when it comes to this lack of fluidity between the players so far? I wouldn't put it down to nerves I think maybe the first five ten minutes you saw a few rest decisions where normally players would have the confidence to bring the ball down from the sky and get playing but I think it's just been the lack of ideas I think it's always difficult to play against Italians they play a low block they do very well they're notoriously hard to break down but we're making it easier for them where we're standing up against them there's no runners off and there's no interchanging when they've got the ball at the back and Georginio's dropping off to get in it there's no real pressure on the ball and I don't think that's the problem with the front three it's because we're so deep defensively that the front three can't get up to the ball can't get any real pressure on the ball I think collectively as a team we need to get higher up the pitch to allow our front three to really start defending from the front like we see the players do from when they're playing for their clubs. Do you expect to see any changes in personnel coming out of the break? Initially no I think Gareth would trust his players that he has on the pitch to try and change it themselves try and find a way to fake them down but of course as soon as you start hitting 55-60 minutes the name that springs to me immediately is Jack Rielish he's the game changer can he get on can he he will get on the ball he will get on the ball in the middle third he will commit players and he hopefully he'll get closer to Harry Kane and get Harry Kane in the game. Well already there's lots for us to talk about and just Townsend's going to be back with us again after the game but a big second 45 coming up for England just to bring you up to speed with what else is going on in the nation's league this evening. The other teams in that group A3 Hungary still ahead 1-0 against Germany so Hungary still leading Germany by Goltenil in the other game still goalless though at San Siro the players have emerged for the second half so I'll hand you back to our commentary team out there in Milan this evening is John Murray alongside Matt Upsett. Thanks Emma yes welcome back to Milan just watching Gareth Southgate in that dark brown suit making his way under the perspex top of the dugout no changes from him at halftime it's the same England team they're out there already Italy are just emerging now so the England team Pope Walker Dyer and Maguire James Rice Bellingham and Saka and Foden and Sterling either side of Kane Matthew Upsett who do you want to see more from from England in the second half well I think we could see more from our wing bats certainly I don't think we've seen the best of Saka and Rice James in that first half but also I think Drew Bellingham as well can get forwards and make those runs I thought the point that Andros made was was bang on in that there's just not enough movement stretching the pitch asking questions of the Italian team who do defend very well there has to be more questions asked in this second half yeah Andros Townsend with this turn out we'll hear from him again at halftime he's watching from back in the UK but Matthew Upsett will play with Englanders here alongside me up in the second tier on the dressing room side Giuseppe Miata stadium Italy are out as well their run changed so as they started the match with Donoroma in goal Toloi, Bernucci and a Cherby the three central defenders Dilerenzo on the right DiMarco on the left then Giorgio with Barela and Cristante either side of him and Raspidori and Scamaca up front second half begins the score Italy nil England nil disappointing first half not many thrills and spilled at all and then Bernucci now at the start of the second half it's a pass that was right out of the first half playbook he hit it straight out of play England take the throw but Sterling is surrounded by Italian blue and so the home side have it back and now Brian Cristante of Roma Giorgio Zemrinho's Roma his ball for that's cleared away by England and Italy have it again with Giorgio inside his own heart and Bernucci just works it out towards the left hand side and then a Cherby a high pass over the top James was underneath that for England though a Cherby was trying to find DiMarco down the left hand side England in the new white shirts tried to find Sterling with the pass but that went astray and it's the same same old thing that we saw in the first half misplaced passes not a good start to the second half two or three things it just aren't quite at it Raheem Sterling doesn't look quite at it for me at the moment to be honest in terms of of having the ball and when he's bitten he's been smothered out he's got to try and offload it a little bit quicker there's two or three players around him there has to be he'll try and find a pass out it's just the Italian players are getting all around him and just smothering him out of the game Bellingham slides into the challenge and misses the ball and Italy move it out to the left DiMarco's ball into the middle cleared away by Dià and he had to get there because Cristante was arriving and he must have been millimeters away with that outstretched foot Cristante from getting a touch but Dià just cleared it well you're absolutely right he was so close to getting on the end of that Cristante but here is Sterling now breaking from inside his own half takes the ball under the edge of the area Benucci with the challenge he caught him Sterling went down and it's a yellow card for the Italian captain for that challenge on the edge of the box on Raheem Sterling but sent him flying down and actually fell into the penalty area but the free kick is just outside well Benucci really protesting strongly with the referee feels he got a piece of the ball and it ricocheted off Sterling but that's just so much better from Raheem Sterling it's not complicated it's just direct it's confident driving at a centre back in that position trying to go past him he's asking the question of Benucci here who for me doesn't get enough of the ball sticks a leg out to lunge into the tackle and Sterling goes over it and wins a free kick right on the edge of the 18-yard box yellow card for Benucci I'm not sure how much contact there was you know on Sterling maybe not maybe not but but he's lured the leg out from Benucci to put that across him and he's just gone over it he's lured he's lured the leg and then Sterling Sterling falling sharply there not for the first time today great position this isn't it James with the free kick we were talking about what he might be capable of they've got a man lying down behind the wall to form an Italian wall chance for Rhys James here from the free kick left of centre two yards outside the box James hits it up and over the wall and high over the bar and he's been mocked by those Italian fans in the lower tier behind the goal who almost I think they are actually doing mock laughter at him way over the top didn't threaten the goal well he's tried to strike it in that manner that you would see a player try and strike the ball if if it was a 10 15 yards further out you know that flat strike where you get that dip on the ball to bounce in front of the goalkeeper he's never going to get it up and down hitting it from that range it was only a yard outside the 18 yard box it needed you know much more finesse on that kind of free kick from that kind of range it's Lee Nell England Nell BBC Radio 5 Live it's a not a Friday night spectacular this by any means here's DeMarco down the left hand side James into the challenge they wanted a free kick the home supporters you can you can hear that but referee Manzano from Spain is unmoved and England have the ball inside the penalty area England in the second half playing from right to left as we look these new white shirts vivid white shirts with the two-tone blue areas on the shoulders dark blue shorts and Harry Kane winning the ball back from Toloy on the halfway line and Harry Kane now approaching the penalty area the angle is against him he shoots and it comes off Benucci and bounces away and behind and Benucci comes across and he cuddles Toloy and he um jeez up his fellow defenders there Cornette Winger well Benucci does well but I have to say I thought Harry Kane could have just flipped this ball across the box early Phil Foden really got on his bike at the back post throws his hands up in the air Foden almost saying he's just got to put the ball across the box and he's in for a strike on goal but he opts to shoot Harry Kane and Benucci just narrowed that angle. James has come across to take out that it's a red streak isn't it it's a sort of reddish pink ready sort of pinky so it's a couple of colors in here. Streak in his hair James with the corner for England towards the back post came as after it the Toloy stood up hard stood up strong and I think he might actually have headed the back of Toloy's head Harry Kane and he's ended up on his front flat on his face he is moving but he's got his hands up to his face and the referee is indicating that the medical people need to come on because he's taken a bash in the face. Yeah whether it's his nose or a part of his face I think as he tried to hit that ball Toloy was there and he just headed almost the side of his head with his face and Harry Kane still laying face down in the grass. Just being handed my pass to go down and go into the interview area post match things are going to have to happen in this match for me to have something to ask questions about and he was just caught he was just caught on the side of the face we're seeing on the replayer I don't think there's any blood there but they'll have to go through the usual check so Italy nil England nil match a few chances it's good opportunity good position that for the James free kick but he just didn't just skyed it really over the crossbar. Just smashed it so hard and you've got a wall in front of you with with a player laying on the floor it needed to be placed somewhere do you know what I mean to get it up and down or to hit it that hard you've even got hit it and the wall breaking you might get a shot on target but it's always going to go over the bar.

Germany nil Hungry 1 was the latest score that we heard and on sports extra right now Bath wasps and the latest is Bath seven wasps 31 while in the United Rugby Championship Glasgow 28 Cardiff 17 and Lester 35 Benetton 10. No action being missed because Kane is still being looked at. He's got a bang to the mouth he's got a bit of a bloodied mouth Harry Kane I think that was the part of his face that struck the side of Toloi's head. Tammy Abraham's warming up down here. Matt but I think Harry Kane is going to come back under the field. Yeah it'd be okay he's just kind of wiped himself down and got on with it but you're right the physio had to check everything. Steve Holland he's got a south gate assistant in his tracksuit he's just come out of the technical area as well just to check and see that Kane is okay he's reached the halfway line and he will be able to come back on. He can currently play with just the 10 men with Kane off the field Italy nil nil Italy with Toloi. Toloi gives it back to Giorgio and the Chelsea manager shuffles forward and then checks back and plays it back to Toloi behind him England have got everyone back behind the ball with Kane off the field and the fourth official I think is not letting Kane back on as Italy play the ball over the top for an easy catch for Pope who comes out of his six yard box and I think the fourth official is saying that there's still blood on his face therefore he can't come back on to the field well he's just been handed loads of different pieces of tissue basically just to keep wiping the blood away I think he's got a cut inside his mouth and obviously it's continuously bleeding so he's still not on the field England are still playing with 10 men but Bellingham now that's strong from him shrugs off Giorgio Bellingham takes it towards the edge of the box gives it to Foden Foden though has three Italians around him gives it back to James square from him to Rice but Rice passes behind Saka the England left wing back tonight the Arsenal man and now Harry Maguire back to Walker and still Kane is not allowed to come back onto the field Foden back to Rice England with it on the far side still Kane is being handed tissues he's got tissues in both hands the fourth official is saying he still can't come back onto the field well I mean there's going to come a point where they're going to say well can he can he come back into play I mean he's been stood there now for quite some time Nick Pulp has hit the ball straight out of play on the halfway line and the referee's raced across now just to give Kane the knot well that was a bit didn't make sense because the referee came over had one look and went what you did come on come on yeah he was already four or five yards on yeah Italy nil England nil oh that's a nice touch from Scamica Harry Maguire comes towards him Scamica turns gives it to the edge of the penalty area it might break for Raspidore but he ran into white England shirts and England clear through Maguire who just puts his left foot through the ball and waxes at a way downfield still nil nil 10 minutes played of the second half and the longer this match goes on the chances increase of a fifth consecutive draw in internationals between Italy and England four draws in a row of course one of them ended up in a penalty shootout victory for Italy at Wendley last year but they are they're very well matched there's really not much between them on the field tonight and it is Italy with Benucci the 35 year old Benucci still going strong craggy as ever ball played from him over the top of Raspidore who puts in DeMarco who plays it across and the offside flag was up actually against Borella who in any case couldn't slide it into the net full stretch on the edge of the six yard box he slid it wide yeah I mean I'm not sure if it was Borella all the the pass before that to DeMarco that was just delayed I think Borella had won it extra touch and then slid the ball wide to DeMarco yeah I think it's the first one from from DeMarco who's trying to hold his run he puts the ball across I mean it is a bad miss I think he was quite quite delighted to see the flag go up if I'm honest he's got to hit the target there. Borella yeah Italy nil England nil remains the score bounce back for Italy against Scamica Scamica who is very good actually as involvement in that last Italy move and then he's basically hauled over by Bellingham oh and now to England he's getting it in the end as well he's getting a foul to England doesn't he can you explain that to me well the only thing I can think of is whether or not Bellingham got his his body across for the ball and then obviously the tangle the referee's interpreted it was was was the fault of Scamica that's a strange one it is I mean I can understand Italy's frustration but yeah they're not giving the ball back to England and Phil Foghren was trying to get it back and he was pushed away shoved away and then DeMarco sat down on the far side so disjointed yeah it's a really poor game actually yeah neither team has has been fluid at all John have they in terms of I can't really say what England's game plan is in possession here what we're trying to what we're trying to achieve and nor Italy either like you said it has to be said both teams are looking a little bit out of sorts I think that are going to have a lot to do against Germany on Monday night to to convince in their last match before the World Cup at this rate but we've still got half an hour and more to play and Bucaio Saca concedes a throw in on the halfway line just bounced back into him and out of play so to throw in I think Italy are going to make the first change Roberto Mancini is I see with his assistant with that distinctive mustache the two of them in discussions they've got the files out but England have won it back on the halfway line Sterling plays it forward Bellingham now runs away from Giorgio Bellingham gives it to Foden on the left Foden chips it across Keynes arriving but a chair he got there first with his head but the offside flag is up against Foden I think and it's a free kick to Italy no no yeah it shouldn't be offside there Phil Foden I mean Italy's line must have been really good Bellingham the ball ricocheted off off Harry Kane and Bellingham was driving at the back four but I think it was Tonali Toloy who just stepped up didn't he caught Foden offside by half a yard Italy nail England 0 almost 15 minutes played in the second half so half an hour to go Italy take the short goal kick out Dona Roma gets it back and then Dona Roma right goes along but straight to James and James actually will give it back to Eric Dyer so England substitutes they're out warming up Grealish is down there Matt looks sure as well I can see Ward Prouse and Mason Mount but England on the field coming forward and the ball to the right hand side Kane whips it across and it came off Toloy who very nearly it was about a foot away from scoring an own goal in fact he defended it well and with his left in step put it beyond the far post and behind best passenger play from England by far and it was so so simple but just executed with quality great play from Eric Dyer he passes the ball through and it's that one touch ball round the corner from Raheem Sterling and Drew Bellingham was making that run from midfield straight into his path Kane peels wide then we get the cross in the box and it was much much better the type of move you want to see from this England team he has James corner it's a very deep one Maguire got there headed it back Bellingham heads it into the box Kane hooks it goalwards but it was at an awkward height Bellingham's taken a bang on the head actually as he was able to foul isn't it it's got to be a foul that John surely what you're suggesting that might be a penalty well I think the initial contact was outside the box but whoever that was was it Barela I don't know who it was who was Kane charging it was Barela really clattered into Drew Bellingham got his head to it we're seeing it again now and it was just outside the penalty area and as he got to it the Italian player made contact with Bellingham sent him sprawling down into the box I think it was outside the area the point of contact as you said so now we've got a stoppage for to do the appropriate checks on Drew Bellingham so Italy nil England nil so who's going to be called forward for England then we've got half an hour left obviously you know multiple substitutions can be made the five changes I mentioned Grealish Mount I would be very surprised if we don't see them coming onto the pitch what do you think yeah I think you can either yeah but possibly look at Tammy Abraham whether he's going to get on and get some minutes and and take Harry Kane off possibly I mean I'm really not sure John it's one of those where it's a difficult one to gauge what a manager would be thinking and who he needs to change all I know is that the move building up to that situation that forced that corner was exactly the type of play that you want to see from England it was slick it was one touch the timing of the movement and the running was good it was Bellingham driving through from midfield everything that you picture when you look down at that team sheet and you look at the formation and see how the players can move and play off each other Italy are actually going to make the changes first I see Tomasso Pobega of Milan AC Milan is going to come on to win his second cap into the midfield so he's the number six and also down there I think that's Wilfried and Jonto of Leeds United the new Leeds United man who's not yet played for Leeds actually after his move right at the end of the transfer window so that's it for Scamica who actually showed some nice touches yeah in the in the second half but again you know that's now eight appearances for him still waiting for his first goal for Italy the West Ham man so and Jonto is on for him and it is Barella who is being replaced by Tomasso Pobega so a double change from Roberto Mancini I think the England changes won't be far away in that no I wouldn't have thought so but I agree with you I thought Scamica had a decent game but he played well showed better touch than what I thought he had a couple times he brought the ball down and showed good good soft touch with his feet England replace number eight so two changes for Italy Italy Nail England Nail five live from the BBC Daya gets up and heads away a long ball on the edge of the penalty area Italy headed forward he has and Jonto with his first touch a little forward number 11 on his back and Toloi and it's threaded forward by Giorgio Gigno now on the right hand side with Cristante Harry Maguire just leans into the challenge and down goes Di Lorenzo that's a free kick free kick to Italy in a good position right corner of the penalty area it's clumsy from Harry Maguire I don't know why he tries to creep around the side of of Di Lorenzo that the danger is along the other side of Di Lorenzo that's straight past down the line where it's going to get slipped in there his position is poor Harry Maguire he tries to anticipate and step in front and and has to shove him to the floor and this is a dangerous situation just wide of the 18-yard box so a free kick to Italy in the end two hour right the four and a half thousand England fans looking down on this I think it's going to be Di Marco well it's Di Marco standing to the right of the ball if he's going to whip it in it's this routine again it is Di Marco and it goes comes off an England head he's well headed away actually it was Walker who was in there he did very well because it was a dangerous delivery England have cleared the penalty area but there's a back heel flick and now the ball across from the right hand side from Raspidori is beaten away beaten behind the near post by Nick Paulp and it's a corner it's a great header from Karl Walker initially we were right along the line of that John and it was I think that was just about curling into that far post we're certainly going to hit the post and maybe go in and Karl Walker just gets his neck around the ball and manages to head it outwards as well here's the corner Raspidori to the near post attempted flake that was blocked away and Janjon to hitch the shot but that comes off Harry Kane from his head high across the penalty area and behind the far post for another Italian corner from the left hand side Milner well England really under fire at the moment the Italians two or three efforts on the goal back to back really starting to apply a little bit of pressure so a corner this time from the left hand side so DeMarco has made his way over there and there is the option of taking it short the referee is just blowing his whistle because I think there's a bit of pushing and shoving and you're not going to believe this but I think Leonardo Benucci might be involved in it Eric Dyer as well the two of them so the referee sport into them both and then Benucci immediately proceeds to put himself all over the day in it comes to the near post pop comes get a one-handed punch on that doesn't clear the penalty area edge of the box Bellingham who's back on the field obviously is fouled and it's a free kick to England just outside the penalty area Harry Kane trained to win get the ball back to take a quick free kick and he was blocked and he's complaining for the referee it's that sort of night yeah it is niggly it is niggly and it's getting into that stage in the game where you really got to roll your sleeves up and try and produce that piece of calm that that cold piece of quality that's going to have a defining moment on this game I still feel that that's the way it's going to go Drew Bellingham does really well in that situation shows good anticipation to defensively to win that ball and draw the tackle on the edge of his own box but midway through the second half Italy nil England nil or italia ingletera as it says on that hoarding above the the entrance on the far side of the stadium good accent John well I'm a natural yeah very it's authentic it's the it's the fashion week effect that it's had on me but at least I know what what we're going to be wearing next year now did you think about that before you packed the suitcase there you better bring your best the funny thing about coming because I've been to Milan in fashion week before I've been to Paris in fashion week as well what four fashion week not four fashion week yes working for horse and hound here's Giorgio bringing the ball forward towards the halfway line plays it back though to Benucci behind him and the funny thing is you can actually spot people all over the place who are here for fashion week Benucci or hits it down that's a lovely touch from raspidori inside the box back onto his right foot shoots that's an excellent goal and it'll take the lead and England are behind here in Milan a super finish from jacka moe raspidori it was a real rasp and pulp diving to his left couldn't get there and England are facing defeat again in the nations league and facing relegation Italy won England nil that right there was that piece of cold quality I was talking about just a few minutes ago it was going to be something like that that was going to define this game and steal it for either side and raspidori well is turned up with a piece of real quality not just to finish the initial touch from the long ball from Benucci was absolutely majestic the way he's just brought it down over his shoulder but it's one thing here with Karl Walker the moment he's got raspidori facing out wide to the left hand side he cannot allow him back on his right foot his whole body shape car walker has to force him wide he's in a great position it's almost like I've done the work I've got back I've dealt with it but then his distance just backs off gives him at half a yard or more two yards shifts it onto his right foot and absolutely buries it in the bottom corner past Pope's left hand it's a great strike but should have been prevented by Karl Walker Italy won England nil great celebration as well he ran away did the heart sign with his hands and ran away to the halfway line actually back towards Mancini it actually had a little bit of tar deli about it from the world cup final the 82 world cup final that wasn't emotional it was but the finish as well actually had a little bit of a touch of that about it right well England have got to respond now England have to find their first goal from open play in this nation's league competition this time round and Jack Dreylich is is going to be sent on and also look sure as well but England now with Foden to James on the right hand side Foden has a look over his shoulder England facing defeat and facing relegation here Bellingham back to Walker and then Walker is left on the ground and that's an illegal challenge from the newly arrived Pope Gap so free kick to England out towards the right hand side I think they're going to get the changes made first of all sure as well isn't it Luke Shaw yep and uh just waiting for the board to be raised well it was raised there and I think we saw the number of Saka Bukayo Saka coming off so that is it for um no I think there might be a change of mind and maybe the changes aren't going to be made just yet England are going to take the free kick first so Saka who's almost to the halfway line is sent back you could time to score now wouldn't it for Bukayo Saka when he knows he's about to be substituted so England one nil down James to take this free kick James curls it in Daya was underneath that with the head up it sends it high over the top he's been challenged by a chairbeat who got in his way to Golpe this is so far far out you're not going to score with a header from the edge of the penalty box are you in the balls that narrow the cross from from Reese James was just too far out no one's going to be able to get any kind of parallel direction on that yeah so Bukayo Saka is off and uh Jack Greelish is on for his 24th cap and Luke Shaw is also coming on to the field so Shaw presumably you would think is going to take over as the uh as the left wing back but it's Kyle Walker yeah who's been taken off so Saka and Walker are off and Shaw comes on Reese James to right side centre back where Walker was and or back for now possibly possibly let's just see how it's no I think you're right John yeah I think as they've now got in position it's a back four with Eric Dyer and Harry Maguire centre backs Reese James at right back Luke Shaw at left back and a midfield of Rice Greelish and Bellingham so Rice sitting as the one in front and Bellingham and Greelish a little bit higher up so we've now got the two England men who can't get into the Manchester United Premier League starting line up at the moment on the field for England yeah Maguire and Shaw playing next to one another Italy leading 1-0 that fine finish from Raspidori in the 69th minute 68th minute I say it has been timed as and um Bukayo Saka so the left wing back how did you think that that worked tonight for Saka not particularly good no um has to be said there was not a lot of uh input into the game in terms of effecting the play um it just didn't didn't work out did it at all there was no no real threat from that side of the pitch just trying to work out how this is operating for England now with with Sterling and Greelish and Kane on the field so Greelish has uh pulled out to a left-sided position here Donna Rummer has been put into pressure by Kane but that was lovely dragged the ball back and beat Harry Kane sent him the wrong way and cleared it away it's composure for you wouldn't it yeah I think I think Rice and Bellingham have now gone to a two so it's a four two three one with Jack Greelish out on on the left hand side and Raheem Sterling just looks to be playing off of Harry Kane yeah Sterling is well he is wearing the number 10 tonight and he's actually now in the number 10 position Raheem Sterling right so that that's quite a significant change having gone a goal behind and uh and really we're into the last 20 minutes now 74th minute Italy one England nil dia stretching for it but it bounces through to Nyonto McGuire comes in with the challenge and Nyonto goes down no free kick McGuire plays it to James still inside the England half James back to Luxor on the left hand side and then Joel long short long and forward for Kane who allows it to run because he knew he was coming from an offside position but Greelish can't get there and it's just played across by Toloi Tagolki by Donna Rummer it is by the way still Germany nil Hungary one so Hungary would go to 10 points in the group Italy would go second in the table with eight points and England would be relegated with the scores as they are now but Hungary have got a very good chance if it stays like that unbelievable isn't it and German this would be Germany's first defeat under Hansi Flick England Germany on Monday night just picturing Zolt Nodsch score the winner in the final job well remembered here's McGuire plays the ball back to Polp Nick Polp has been unconvincing with his his footwork tonight I think that's another thing that we've taken from this evening and Polp now playing it out across the back line and actually sure can't keep that in and just as I mentioned that no poor poor piece of footwork a poor delivery then clearance from Nick Polp out for a throw it is but I'm not seeing that many white shirts really moving into space to want to receive that ball so in that case you better off just putting your foot through it this Italian attack breaks down on the edge of the box came to nothing 15 minutes to go and Dingland now in a position where it feels like it's a it's a desperate bid to salvage something from this match I mean they're not going to get the performance tonight that the hope was from England supporters that they would see something to encourage them eight weeks away from the World Cup but that's not happened and it's been an Italy side it's been a stodgy sort of game it's not been the kind of match where you would expect to see a sparkling performance but that certainly has not materialised for England Kane that's good nice touch to Fordham Fordham's away Vanuci's out of position now Fordham to his Manchester City teammate Grealish Grealish with a touch but Italy are back in position Shaw joins in now on the left low ball right across the penalty area cleared away by Italy comes out to Rice Rice Square to Birmingham Birmingham just outside the D stabs it to Kane Kane drives it from the angle comes back to him shoots again and that's a double save from Donorumma both efforts more or less at him but hit well by Kane Kane plays it in again from the right hand side Giorgio Stretches to block that and Italy are able to take it away and run it away with DiMarco but there we are England finally creating something and now Fordham again Fordham stabbing it back Shaw Shaw his cross by the way Luke Shaw that was just good banking for someone to put it into the net but there was no one there in white and now Sterling goes between two men to the edge of the penalty area Vanuci though stands up strong takes the ball off him and England now finally one nil down in the last 15 minutes have come to life all of a sudden England just look far far better the lovely passage of play nice movement running off the ball one and two touch again very similar to that one that was earlier and I mean how big is Donorumma in goal you can just smash the ball at the goal he's just it's just so he just fills the whole net doesn't he as Harry Kane really put his foot through that strike England pinning Italy back now Bellingham to left hand side of the corner of the box Shaw back to Rice again Rice is going to have a go no he beats and Yonzo and then turns it back to behind him Italy it's all hands to the pump now the games changed completely Italy went ahead but now England are all over them Vanuci puts in the challenge on Grealish but not enough for a penalty Grealish went down but Donorumma as the ball went between them was able to drop on it I mean when Kane pulled wide for that effort I don't know if maybe just firing that ball back across there was a lot of bodies in that six-yard box weren't there he elects to strike at Donorumma from quite a narrow angle and so hard to score pass I think he's just hoping that he was going to maybe deflect off a couple of bodies on the way through and wind up in the back of the net but he struck it so cleanly the big Italian goalkeeper was more than a match for it that's Matt Upson this is five live from the BBC England heading to defeat here in Milan one nil down Giacomo Raspidori but England with the change of formation changed her back for the fact that Italy are leading so they're trying to preserve what they've got that Grealish has brought a bit of life to England and we're seeing Foden in the right sort of areas now and Harry Kane forcing those two saves from Donorumma. I mean another player has been quite ineffective Phil Foden has he in this game by his standards he's not really just not in the right areas no he's not been had the space or the ability to to get on the ball and all of a sudden now he's looking far more threatening Sterling that's better and he also has been enlivened in that number 10 role Dallin and Nog loses it and then actually commits a foul and also writes two and that is a free kick to Italy and they'll be in no hurry whatsoever to take this the Italians with the with the one nil lead that they have we will have more from Andros Townsend once the match is finished he'll be joining us from back in the UK for the last 20 minutes of the program five live sport on air till 10 tonight but time running out for England here time running out in the top tier of the nation's league and everything that comes from that I mean it will affect the the seeding for the European Championship draw so it means that England will have a tougher group than they've become accustomed to but the match is still being played and where there's life McGuire to Kane and now here is Grealish on the left hand side Giorgio in with the challenge Giorgio on the net that looked like a foul from Di Lorenzo and Grealish it was free kick to England and a yellow card for Di Lorenzo for that challenge on the Manchester City man I mean I've got to say it is the one part about the Italian game that has really impressed me tonight their ability to hunt as a group in small groups twos and threes and fours when they've lost that ball the recovery they have for the the supporting team player is absolutely been brilliant that I think that's been a real problem for England whenever they've gotten that ball there's no time whatsoever to get your head up and have a look you've got shirts all around you and Di Lorenzo just a little bit too much they're crossed the line and made that foul and got a yellow card for it the goal scorer is being substituted Giacomo Raspidori is being replaced by none other than Manolo Gabiadini the former Southampton man now with Sampdoria who is winning his first cap since 2017 30 years old now and the last time he played was when Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup and lost here in this stadium to Sweden in the playoff England with a free kick James plays it in but spread at Donoroma who touches it away that was not far away from Dyer but the goalkeeper got his gloves to it it's that Donoroma again the scourge of England at the European Championship and now James has it on the left hand side Grealish Grealish was challenged there by Inyanto and that's a foul as well on Jack Grealish Cristante was involved in that as well by the way that that coming together for England and Italy Giorgino and Grealish just a few moments ago remember extra time in the Euro final a Giorgino challenge that might have been a red card yeah here's Rice to the right hand side into the last 10 minutes now we're in the 82nd minute of the match as it says on the huge absolutely massive screen on the far side of the ground with the two crests of the two countries and up there as well under the Italian crest 68 Raspidori the only goal that we've seen Maguire still deep inside his own half Rice he has Luke Shaw substitute Shaw plays it to Ken the Ken's still inside his own half Benicio's gone all the way there with him and Benicio's now on the right wing and Benicio plays it infield it's away from Gaby Agini but Tobega takes it onto the edge of the box but England put the challenge in it's actually Eric Dyer and James has now taken the ball away to the halfway line Stirling is there Stirling tightly watched by a chairbeam Grealish in the central area the three centre backs have stepped that well for Italy as well one of those wide ones whenever it's gone short they've gone all the way in very Italian style and you've got Benucci in between the pair of them just orchestrating things communicating really directing the play either side of him well Italy under Mancini have kept just the one clean sheet in our last seven matches but Mancini's made the change of system tonight going to three at the back to match up England and a clean sheet this evening which would be their second in the nation's league remember the nil nil draw against Wolves their second against England in the nation's league would get them the win he has Dallingham though outside the box under his left foot should put wildly wide but thanks to his face the 19 year old Tolloy was with him and forced him to shoot wide it's a tough tough effort leaning on his left foot always falling to the side just probably almost that desperation to want to get a shot off on goal I mean that for me John is one of the most concerning things for him at the moment is the lack of goal opportunity in this game and in previous matches it's now starting to really become an issue yes yes you know the two or three games in a row you can't go okay but we're now talking what five six matches where the goals haven't really all the chances aren't really being created yeah problem is as I say you know having racked up the goals in the qualifiers against the weaker teams that were in England's qualifying group for the World Cup scoring all of those goals that what's going to be directed at England now is that you're not up to it against the better teams and that's what the the facts that we're witnessing back up well that's what the nation's league exposes Paul played through the Gabbiadini there's no flag yet Gabbiadini through the top save with his legs and the ball bounces out to the edge of the box still no flags so he was given on side Gabbiadini now to the left hand side to DeMarco plays it across top couldn't get there in the middle and sliding in at the back post I mean it came at pace DeLorenzo arriving and he couldn't direct it on target and the ball eventually bounces out of play for a throw to Italy near the corner flag well the ball pinged right off the off the post and it came straight into lucho's feet I mean I don't think you knew you didn't know anything about it whatsoever but I mean that was quite loose the way Gabbiadini managed to get through here on goal and it was a poor finish for me actually it was a real one on one with with Pope and if he just picks a corner out he probably scores and it's two nil but I think it actually hit the foot of the post from DeMarco's cross yeah so deep pulp hit the foot of the post and DeLorenzo diving in sliding in as you say it had rebounded to shore who was able to clear it away so it is still one nil to Italy could easily have been two nil that yeah for sure I mean that was a great opportunity for Gabbiadini he should score he's one on one with Pope and should pick a corner so throwing Italy wants to make another change but the throwing is taken and Nyonto that's a nice turn shore puts in the challenge and Nyonto shrugged off it Grealish flicks it to shore shore plays it back to Grealish near the edge of his own box he was fouled Jack Grealish and the referee is going to bring it back for the free kick that England take quickly England urgency now we're into the last five minutes security announcements come out hello English fans well they're getting their instructions the four and a half thousand England fans I don't know how many of them are going to cat at but it's been another performance that raises many many doubts about what England will be capable of when it comes to the World Cup in two months time Sterling ball played forward to him the challenge came in and he was left on the ground looked to foul didn't it I think it's only been given as a throw in yeah whether or not the linesman was looking right at it and didn't flag whether or not he felt that Raheem Sterling went down a little bit too easy I think there was some contact as the ball was bouncing up around Raheem Sterling's chest but maybe not enough contact to warrant him going over so it is a throw in for Italy which is pulled up the line by a chirby, Maguire nods it forward Maguire is able to to find batting him batting him on the stretch Maguire has to come into the rescue paper planes are now being thrown from the the top tiers of the stand that's why you can hear the cheers from the supporters who are cheering when the paper planes reach the playing surface it's been a poor match decided by a very good finish actually from Raspidori unless England can come up with a late equaliser, Pobega leaves it for DiMarco the moment though it's Italy who are coming forward it's Italy on the attack and the ball is played through to the edge of the box it might come back to DiMarco on the edge of the area but Reiss just got there there's another paper aeroplane appears from above our heads Durlorezzo now just outside the area he gives it square Cristante with the shot but that's up and over the top left corner and into the Italian fans behind the fence great chance Cristante receives the ball on his left foot first touch across his body and he's just leaning back and blasts it over the bar if he just goes cold on it and just places it in the corner with a side foot I think he would have scored and England looking a little bit vulnerable again and the Italians having a bit of a surge late on and Roberto Mancini is going to make his final two changes Federico DiMarco is coming off a lovely round of applause from him Emerson is coming on the West Ham man to replace DiMarco and also leaving the field Giorgio Gigno of Chelsea that's the end of his evening and it will be the number seven Davide Fratesi who is actually a late call into this squad to replace the injured Verratti of PSG Fratesi winning his fourth cap tonight the day after his 23rd birthday so Giorgio Gigno is off the field he's just done his thing tonight Giorgio Gigno this is his sort of game this one yeah yeah just keeps it ticking over sits in front of the the back three wins fouls passes it simple he's had a decent game but it's hard to pick any player that's really stood out and you've gone wow I mean it certainly from an attacking sense I thought DiMarco has been as good as anyone yeah DiMarco's been good I think Eric Dyer has had a pretty good game if I'm honest and I think he's been very good with the ball yeah I think um as England take a throw in deep inside their own territory we are now in the 90th minute Garas Southgate's made just the two changes tonight with uh with Grealish and Shaw coming on so no Mason Mount this evening back it comes to Rice but it's going to come for England it's going to come late James low ball to Sterling edge of the area there's a little bit of space for him tries to play it to belly him in the box but Italy did well stepped up it was actually Di Lorenzo and Di Lorenzo now is leading the counter attack and the ball bounces out to Inyanto on the left hand side he keeps it in blue shirts pouring forward even though they've got a one in a lead and Inyanto into the area beats James and then shoots from the angle into the back of Eric Dyer's legs and it bounces out for throwing on the far side and the spectators jumping over the holdings trying to get onto the field but he's he actually has he has jumped over the holders and he's running onto the field just keeping my eye on him because he seems so determined to get onto the pitch he's got a bit of place as well John yeah I did worry about what he might be doing but I do think he's just a yeah he is it's just another one of those crowd it's just another one of those pitch invaders and of course you know now certainly in the UK if you do this you are facing a long ban you're not going to another football match for a long long time and actually you're going to have criminal proceedings taken against you so after that it's going to be a throw in for Italy we're well into added time seven minutes was it six six minutes of added time to play so England have got six minutes less than six minutes now to come up with this equaliser otherwise it's going to be relegation tonight from the nation's league Grealish on the edge of his own penalty area plays the ball intricately inside his own box between two Italians and um and England still haven't cleared it from their own defensive third here he is again Grealish but he's at the wrong end of the pitch here he's not going to affect things at the other end England have got to get forward and they've got to get forward quickly and that's what they're doing with Harry Maguire Maguire opens his legs and takes it over the halfway line but then shore and rice now Bellingham Bellingham and Jontopoets arrives on him Thoden Thoden turns infield he's on his left foot square from him to shore Luke Shaw just outside the box back to Thoden Thoden didn't have too many options there and might have been fouled no he wasn't fouled Italy could break away but rice comes in and is able to play it over the top James now juggles the ball Sterling has it on the right hand side Raheem Sterling two Italians in front of him he's in the full back position uses his now Chelsea clubmate Rhys James Grealish out there as well Sterling takes it up once again but Italy have got everyone back behind the ball trying to defend this one-nil lead that they have back it goes for England into the centre circle shore to rice forward to rice rice is going to shoot down it goes but Donnarumma is able to drop onto it and clutch it very safely and securely into his chest that shot from Declan Rice from outside the box solid goalkeeping from Donnarumma had a bit of sting on that shot from Rice and it bounced awkwardly right in front of the goalkeeper had a bit of real swerve and dip on it but he really kept his eye on it very solid piece of handling from Donnarumma two and a half minutes of the six about a time have gone already Jack Grealish is unhappy and he's been yellow carded speaking out of turn to the referee I think he's frustrated by the the treatment that he's had since he's come onto the field Jack Grealish it's been fouled a lot he has been fouled a lot which he always is because he's that type of player but that reaction I'm afraid means that he's going to be suspended from Monday night right so he's out of the Germany game Jack Grealish well that is costly then yeah I mean you know he'll be in the World Cup squad I don't think there's any doubt about that is that but no but from his perspective yeah it's you know to miss a game because of that yeah it's not on yeah it's just frustration and he's so close to the referee he's right in his face and that's why the yellow card came England win another little free kick dire to James James ball into the box chair he stretches and then Gabiagini's on the edge of the penalty area Gabiagini just shrivels it out of play on the far side throwing to England on the right almost four minutes so just two minutes to play no a poor throw and Jondo has actually nipped in and got the ball back and he's going to carry it away downfield he's actually drawn the foul from James as well and that's very well played by the little new Leeds United man to win the free kick for Italy it's quite an impact player isn't he very pacy very strong Jonto done really well there won the ball back and knew exactly what he was doing the moment he was faced up between Rhys James and I think it was Dyatt he just wanted to run across the pass of Rhys James there's a little bit of contact and over he goes and Italy can now just slow the pace of the game down again and they are now really only a matter of seconds away from recording what will be for Italy only their second win in this nation's lead group but it'll leave England with two points from five matches and it means that this England team two months before the World Cup their relegation will be confirmed for the next playing of the the nation's league England will be in league B next time it comes round but this will affect the seeding for the European Championship in a couple of weeks time means England will be in a tough group for the Euros qualifying but still we play the still time yet James Italy backing away James Cross Belliam with a header but he's put it over top from seven yards out. Chards big chance Jude Bellingham gets up well the only thing is he's not coming onto this ball he's kind of jumping and heading from a standing position it's always harder to to guide the ball where you want it when you've got that momentum coming onto it you can really power the ball into the net and he just tries to to head this one he gets higher he gets really good contact on the ball which just can't get over and he goes probably about a foot over the crossbar now Italian fans are running down the stands behind Donoroma's goal like getting ready to celebrate this victory against England Bellingham playing it forward Kane gets a touch advances through Stirling can't get there and Benucci just hoists it away out of play and make it that the six minutes are up England have got a throw but I think this will be the last action it's taken back to the halfway line Eric Dyer's got it it has to go forward for England he gives it square to McGuire and McGuire carries it on and now it's to Shaw and Shaw flicks it forward for Bellingham and then Bellingham back to Shaw again the ball rattles and ricochets back to Grealish for 30 seconds over the six minutes now the calling for the whistle to be blown Grealish and Shaw on the left hand side still Grealish he's been tugged back Grealish now trying to force his way into the penalty area but it's taken away for Italy by Fratasi and Fratasi's over the halfway line and England vainly trying to get back it's actually rolled behind Emerson on the left hand side and actually now he's been taken away by Pabega down towards the corner flag just to see out the victory and England have got two men there with him the ball bounces out of play but that's it there's the final whistle and England here in Milan England are relegated from the nation's league two months before they go to the World Cup in Qatar England suffer the ignominy of a relegation they've been beaten by one goal to nail a fine goal from Raspidori in the second half but it's not happened again for England tonight and this nation's league campaign has proved to be really really disappointing for Gareth Southgate who shakes hands with Roberto Mancini down there on the pitch but really it's faltered and these have been the worst of times for England under Gareth Southgate or just having the word relegation at the moment for this group of players it's just rubbing salt into the wound really it's more for me about the performance or the lack of performance it has to be said in terms of as a team being able to be creative be cohesive have that kind of gel with the movement and the passing and it be smoother it's just not particularly smooth at the moment from England and we're really struggling to create good goal scoring opportunities you know you can always take some positives from the game I thought there was a couple of performances I thought Eric Dyer now looks to be more of you know one of our stronger centre backs for selection at the moment I thought he had a pretty steady game and looks to be more willing and comfortable to try and get on the ball and break lines with the pass and and try and create something from that position but it's just a pretty negative night for England yeah it is Harry Kane just leaving the field the reaction of the England players on the final whistle many of them dropped to the ground I think that was a reflection of the fact that they know eh they're beaten with B they weren't able to come up with the performance that they wanted to by any means here tonight Italy have won it one nil here in the land and England will be relegated from the nation's league",
