  "transcript": " begin one nil up after their victory and their away goal at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last week and Ajax plan to reach their first Champions League final since 1996. Ajax tonight are wearing that famous pit with the white sleeves and white sides of the shirt and the broad red band vertically up the front and the back white numbers white shorts and white socks with red trim and their captain their captain this boy mountain Matthias Delict the 19 year old shaking hands with the experienced world cup winning captain that Tottenham having goal he's all in orange Hugo Larisse he's indicating that the the teams are going to switch around actually and it's actually a late change to the Ajax team. Neres must have a problem because it appears that Casper Dahlberg the the young Danish striker is out there on the field the number 25 he's very blonde hair long blonde hair here he is yeah next to the the center circle so a late change for Ajax and it's Neres David Neres who has not been able to come out clearly been injured in the warm-up so so I think he's on the bench at the weekend wasn't in what and he was an injured certainly an injury concerned came on as a sub in the cook for the weekend yeah there you go and no that's a massive blow because he has been a key player for Ajax in this competition got the important goal here against Juventus so I think we'll see Tadich come out to the left-hand side and Dahlberg centre forward by trade we'll go up top so it is Ajax against Tottenham Hotspur we're live here in the Jullhand-Kreuth arena on the south side of Amsterdam on a mild evening the roof is open we can see the blue sky above and Tottenham kickoff 90 minutes away from their first Champions League final but it's a tall order tonight to win through here and turn this tie around I hope you enjoyed the drama last night I hope you're listening to Five Live and Ian Dennis and Alan Shearer with the commentary I can't promise that we'll be able to provide anything quite as dramatic as that but this Champions League very very rarely fails to deliver at this stage of the competition and so Ajax who are playing from right to left in the first half against Tottenham who are wearing their two-tone green the jade green and the dark green sleeves and shoulders and Ajax with the ball inside their own half so Ajax now having made that change yep you're right Chris Dahlberg playing through the middle and Tadich on the left-hand side they have an Anna in goal who's got the ball at his feet now clearing the ball away as Lucas Moura tried to close him down and it is out of play on the halfway line Tadich just leaned into by Trippia it is only a throw in says the referee who's the German Felix Brich so the Ajax team on Anna in goal a back four of Mas Raui, Delict, Blint and Talia Fico in midfield Schoenach, Van der Beek and De Jong van der Beek who scored the only goal of the tie so far and then Ziak on the right Tadich on the left now the top scorer this season and Dahlberg through the middle and Anna with the ball at his feet again left-footed curls a long pass out but Sissoko shields that and it's out of play for another throw and Tottenham tonight, Loris, Trippia, Aldervirel for Tongan and Rose, Wanyama and Sissoko, Ericsson, Ali, Lucas Moura and Son Sissoko swinging a high pass from right down below us out to the far side to Danny Rose and Son who is on the left-hand side just for the time being Son takes possession and knocks it back into his own half and we've got the two former Ajax central defenders for Tongan and Aldervirel, Jan for Tongan who's wearing a per-specs mask on his face didn't play at the weekend, Mauricio Pocciettino said yesterday he's fine there's no problem with his his well-being he said it's not an issue but he is wearing that per-specs mask as the ball is played back to daily Blint, Blint onto his left foot curls the pass here to the left-hand side where the left back the Argentine Talia Fico finds Taditch, Taditch is away from Trippia back onto his right foot but the former Southampton man on his left foot again and then uses his right to poke it forward for Vanderbake and Vanderbake turns near the corner flag now plays it in field a stretch from Taditch that takes it back to De Jong and now he is Schöner, Schöner square from him and the ball is lifted into the penalty area and Chester down by Dahlberg but he couldn't get the ball under control it's clear to where it rattles around then a shot on the edge of the penalty area from Ziak which is blocked on the edge of the box and now Tottenham Bragg Lucas Moura receives it from Dali Ali but delict leans into him and wins the ball back for Ajax, Chris Sutton. Yeah and he should have fed Song Moura as a chance, Song on the left-hand side on the overlap didn't feed the ball through as a chance for Ajax I just wondered whether there was an offside in there. Ziak now to Taditch edge of the penalty area shoots and a save by Lloris full length left hand to it and that is a top save from the Tottenham goalkeeper to push it round the post. Yeah as Taditch off the left-hand side I think it takes a deflection off Kiran Trippi as left ankle and Lloris is a big left hand to get it round the post. You feel Lloris is gonna have to have a big night for Spurs. Well that will make him feel good Clearly there have been questions about his form this season got a good sight of it perhaps the deflection helped him but a good save nevertheless. Corner then for Ajax this is the first of the match it's nil nil very early stages here on BBC Radio 5 Live. The out swinging corner, delict with a header! Scores! Ajax are in front only four minutes on the clock and it is the 19 year old captain towering above anyone else heading in from seven or eight yards it flew past Lloris that is the early goal that the Johan Cruyff arena wanted and there is an explosion of noise in here and this semi-final now has just become all the harder for Tottenham. One nil Ajax, two nil on aggregate. It's a poor from Tottenham's point of view but this young man is going to play for the first time in a row. He's in the first place as delict lights up the arena it's the perfect start from Ajax. I think he runs off Trippier is just checking this the referee Spurs players surrounding the referee asking for a foul I didn't think it was but it's a towering header no one on the post for Spurs and Spurs are really gonna have to do this the hard way. So Trippier marking delict and Delhi Ali was centrally on the six yard line but he lost and he did lost Trippier. I think Trippier is there as a blocker gone half zone all that but Ali didn't attack the ball but as soon as he got the run delict unstoppable clinical header. So one nil we've now played five and a half minutes and Matthias delict it's his seventh goal of the season remember he scored the crucial goal the winner away against Juventus here's Son on the left hand side Son now into the penalty area does well. Pliss and Cross hits the post. Paul scrambles inside the box. Ericsson on the stretch could only stab it into a defender on the edge of the six yard area and the post cleared. What a start to the game I think it was a cross from Son really good driving run down the left hand side went across the ball in and then let it go. Hit the post and somehow Ajax scrambled it to safety lacks goalkeeping though from an Anna. Certainly was he stepped off his lane at the near post and Son drove it low and he hit the foot of the post. Ericsson was in the box stretching for it but couldn't get any meaningful shot in on it and it was blocked on the edge of the area and so it is still Ajax one Tottenham nil but we've got to start here a little like the Etihad Stadium in the in the previous round for Tottenham. Spurs responded in the Etihad just watching again the corner and it is Trippier I have to say it's really poor from Trippier initially you know he's there as a blocker delict just shrugs him aside gets an easy run and powers over Ali and heads it home the perfect start for Ajax. Yeah deli Ali was effectively stationary as delict was making the run high above him or at least a head above him and that was enough for delict to head it what a good head or as well though central defender classic central defenders goal from a set piece. Well he's a powerhouse who can play but really disappointed from Trippier you know he's been assigned to do a job there make sure you get a block on don't make it easy I'm not saying Ali covered himself in glory as well but very difficult and the defender that powerful gets a run and a jump on you. So two nil on aggregate Sasoko it's challenged he is fouled as that daily Blint comes in and captures Sasoko who's just stayed down rubbing his right knee right thigh. It's a bouncing ball I think that's a naughty challenge he's lucky to get away with that. Ali Blint. Studge up, studge up caught him on the side of the knee daily Blint free kick and nothing more than that could easily have been a yellow card. One nil Ajax lead free kick though Trippier to take this in curls it beyond the defensive line flick back in from the left hand side by deli Ali and cleared out into the full back position on the far side. Ericsson turns plays it back to Danny Rose. Rose then in field towards Sasoko with those distinctive white wrist bands on each wrist. Long to the right hand side to Trippier. Here's Lucas Moura. Lucas Moura plays the ball straight into Taditch and so Tottenham are back in possession closer to the halfway line Trippier going back into his own half and we see for the first time Eric Ten Haag the coach who has had this terrific season they're in the running for a treble and no one expected it. Their first match in this competition in the second qualifying round was played just ten days after the World Cup final. Here's Trippier many of these Tottenham players of course were only just back from the World Cup. Here is Wanyama plays it to the left hand side for Tongan and now Wanyama up towards Lucas Moura and he's leaned into by Blint and Tottenham come out with the ball. Lucas Moura now to Dali Ali 30 yards out taking it onto the edge of the D and that's a superb sliding interception and tackle. Guess who? From Frankie De Jong the Barcelona bound Frankie De Jong. Nipped it away beautifully but he has Ericsson now on his old stamping ground. Oh lovely reverse past it Dali Ali curling shot wide of the far post from the left side of the penalty area. I think the flag went up anyway but what a start to the game really open. Lovely reverse pass from Ericsson. We know he's capable and he is marginally very tight Dali Ali offside but off the mark as well it was a poor effort. So Ajax have continued their record of scoring in every match at home this season. They've only lost one in any competition here that was to Real Madrid in the last 16 and of course they went and won so convincingly and so brilliantly in the Bernabal. That was their 166th goal of the season in all competitions. One Nile Ali here the ball is played by Vanderbake to the right hand side. Ziak on his left foot shoots but it took a double deflection bounces back to the red and white of Ajax. Blint is almost joining in the attack now here's Tali Fico to Ziak edge of the penalty area forced wide into the full back area Tadicic close quarters. Ziak still going curls over the cross to the back post and Danny Rose is able to chest it back to Loris who sets off Tottenham immediately on the counter attack. Danny Rose just cantering forward at the moment and then passing the ball to Son on the left wing. Son turns and takes on Delict who gets in the challenge. Huge tears such a favourite here this 19-year-old who played in the Europa League final two years ago against Manchester United remember as a 17-year-old he's the youngest man ever to have achieved 100 appearances for the Ajax first team. Talked about leading by example he's a real powerhouse pace reads the game well he's got the lot Eric Tenhark saying he's not gonna be it next season all the big guns are gonna be in for him and Chris as well as that as well as being supremely talented it looks like a film star tall blonde hair swept back blue eyes big jaw he could be in a Western taking on John Wayne that's one for our younger listeners Ajax leading Tottenham by one goal to nil it's not serious serious yet but it is it was a tall order now it's a really tall order well I mean Spurs is clear what they have to do now but they have looked to threat in the early stages going forward however van der Beek now to Schoen back to van der Beek inside the penalty area now back to Schoen about Ericsson comes in with a challenge van der Beek still puts the challenge in on Cicoko but Ericsson was there to chip it away to the halfway line but across from right back comes Mas Raui and clears but Lucas Moura now running with intent at the Ajax defence but under pressure passes the ball beyond Delhi Ali and Mas Raui who is back out right back Mas Raui the Moroccan international one of the Moroccan internationals in the Ajax squad like Zeeck he's played most of the season at right back but it just come back from injury which is why Veltman played in the first leg. He's a versatile player at Mas Raui playing midfield as well but all these Ajax players very very comfortable wherever they play. Ericsson lifting the ball into the area Lucas Moura just heads it on and the ball drops into the clubs of the Cameroon international goalkeeper Andre Onanak so Ajax leading by one goal to nil. I'm sure you can hear the brilliant atmosphere they have a massive absolutely massive red and white drum which is right in the middle of the end to our right and there are a number of Ajax supporters who are gathered around it with the taps off as they say in Glasgow as you'll know Chris as the ball goes back to Onanak out to the right-hand side Chris Sutton who once scored for Celtic here in this competition in this stadium here now is I suspect there'll be some taps off that night to celebrate it as well. Here's Zeeck Zeeck playing the ball forward now for the run through the middle by Dolberg drafted in late oh and then Zeeck catches Danny Rose he was late and sent Danny Rose sprawling I think he's okay three kicks off. Very clever from Danny Rose under pressure Zeeck behind him just let it run through his legs out on the left hand touch line but Zeeck at the World Cup was a bit of a disappointment has to be said and he's been a revelation right foot left foot good shot on him. Ball played up from the back by Aldervayrock headed on by Lucas Moura deli-ali the ball bounces down delict is there delict wins it back from deli-ali stronger just looked like a greater hunger there and he took the ball away and Ajax are back in possession inside their own half. Chris all of the European ties that you were involved in this sort of situation you know what what it taught them what is that what has their approach got to be now? Well I mean you know at the start the emphasis would have been on balance not conceding an early goal it's the worst possible start you know Spurs know they can't concede again but in the first leg they didn't really look a threat going forward they've looked at threatening these early stages they just have to be clinical whether it's the final pass or they get the opportunity there's still no rush from Spurs. BBC Radio 5 Live live in Amsterdam Ajax winning 1-0 on the night 2-0 on aggregate As Fertonghen is caught there by Dolberg on the halfway line and with the free kick to Spurs get the ball rolling quickly Fertonghen just getting to his feet just putting his hand up to his mask I think he was just readjusting it as Lucas Moura now 15 yards inside the Ajax half loses possession Cisoco is able to win it back strong holds off Kaddic and Trippier passes a little ahead of Cisoco who slides into the challenge with Calio Fico there were feet raised there as the two of them came together they're still on the ground Cisoco is pleading his innocence Calio Fico has reacted quite strongly there to the challenge that came in and referee Brick is actually reaching for his yellow card to Cisoco. Well do you know what referee let the earlier one go daily blend I think Cisoco feels he can get the ball he goes to ground and that's the issue now I think it's a yellow card but that shouldn't be the first one of this evening I think Maritjo Pochettino he's unhappy about that and quite rightly so he's all in black tonight Maritjo Pochettino looks a little bit like he could be in the Western that Matthias Delink might be in here's the ball down the left-hand side that's deflected out of play and it's a throwing to top them half inside their own half we've only seen the bad and the ugly of first so far defensively. Yep we had the spaghetti last night throwing from Trippia here's Lucas Moura, Lucas Moura rolls the ball to the left-hand side yep we watched that night of nights last night for Liverpool in an Italian restaurant with absolutely no one else. Son tries to take the ball through the middle Delik is able to take the ball away and now Ziak his pass hits Rose and then Ziak is able to turn it all the way back to Delik again on the edge of the penalty area. Ziak's almost in his own right back area little ball to De Jong and now Ziak and this is this is trademark Ajax this season they are passing the ball slickly and quickly out from the back and they're passing it around Tottenham and you can hear the reception to this as well from the Ajax supporters inside the stadium around us 55,000 or so. They cannot let De Jong dictate the players in Deli Alley's area he needs to be all over him Deli Alley don't let him get his head up everything goes through him. Wintery orchestrates the attacks. Chris for those listeners who might not have seen Frankie De Jong play you know Barcelona are spending something like 75 million euros on him he's 21 he's 22 this week actually on Sunday tell everyone what it is about him that that makes him worth that money. Well in a city famous for their artists I mean he is an absolute artist he really is he glides through the game and is in possession. Vanderbake is flicking the ball to Ziak Ziak crafts a pass that's beyond Kadditch down the left and bounces beyond him and out of play throwing to Tottenham. I can't remember seeing two young players delict under De Jong who are this mature at this stage of their careers and they play like 32 year olds have a hundred caps they really do. Yes De Jong in midfield he's a bit more of a Rembrandt isn't he whereas delict at the back he's a little bit more Jackson Pollock throwing four Ajax on this side of the field up towards Dolberg bounces down and then it's just a little push from Dolberg and it's a free kick to Tottenham half way inside their own half almost 20 minutes played and that early-burly start to the match is just settled down now which I guess is good for Ajax as well with that goal. Well we know they have more goals and don't we I mean but credit to them because that change at the start and they're injured they've adapted very well Dolberg going centrally. Kadditch on the left-hand side keeping the ball van der Big actually turns and back heals it to Kadditch when he could actually have just passed it to him and now Talia Fico goes to ground very easily against the Solco in with a challenge second foul on Solco against Talia Fico and it's one Ajax a free kick on the left-hand side half way inside the Tottenham half. It's looking good for Ajax at the moment. 28 minutes on the clock Ajax one Tottenham nil. It's gonna have to be quite a comeback quite a Champions League fight back if we're going to see only the second final featuring two English clubs in the Champions League. Free kick chance for Ajax to make it even worse. Now Ziak plays it in and it's headed up and away by Fatongan did well actually for Fatongan running back into his six yard box and heading it away and Lukas Moura now for to Christian Eriksen. Christian Eriksen has two men on him manages to find the pass to Song who's come all the way across to the right-hand side but he has the ball nipped away from him by Mas Raui and they're at it again Ajax passing the ball from the back and then it goes back into central defence to the goal scorer Delict. So quick and slick with their transitions. Ajax was good defending from Mas Raui. This first broke out. Ajax four times European champions not since 1995 as Tottenham play the ball back into the centre circle. Tottenham trying to get to their first European final since the 1984 UEFA Cup. Here's Cisoco in the centre circle Cisoco battles his way through two three challenges still going Cisoco plays it to Son on the right-hand side Son approaching the penalty area step over goes for the curling shot it's deflected right across the area but Rose couldn't get there and Mas Raui was able to step out and clear it away and then Zeeck is challenged he's found free kick to Tongan coming in for the challenge free kick to Ajax. Spurs hard done by there but that was a good positive driving run from the powerhouse Cisoco in the middle of the park for a few bodies popped the ball out wide and a shot from Son came to nothing. Ajax one nil up and Mauritio Pochettino has plenty to think about there on the touch line Spurs second semifinal of the season they've lost in semifinals in each of the last three seasons and two nil down on aggregate here are looking at another exit in the last four. Still three-quarters of the match to play though as the ball is passed forward by Talia Fico but Alderviral will get there and steer it back to Lloris on his left foot passes the ball out to Wanyama edge of the penalty area back it goes into the box to Tongan the whistles in the Gias are trying to put the jitters on Tottenham who are passing it out Ajax style Rose nice flick from Ericsson back to Rose who's over the halfway line Rose is then shoved over referee allows play to continue Deli Ali what a pass to Son Son stabs it goalwards I know Nana is able to drop down to his left and make that a routine save. I tell you what that was really good from Spurs Ericsson in his own half clever little flick to release Rose. Pop the ball into Deli Ali it's a really incisive ball son in between the two centre halves he just can't get the ball out of his feet enough. He prods the ball and Nana gets down to his left hand side half a chance for Spurs. More like it that's what they want that was good from Deli Ali as well and here he is Deli Ali Lucas Moura who's driving into the penalty area lays it back Ericsson with a shot straight at the Nana from an angle on his left foot he shot straight at the Ajax goalkeeper's chest. Well they have to be clinical at some stage Spurs and it was a really good driving run from Lucas Moura got in between the centre halves actually prods the ball back of it Ericsson you expect him from that range how many times what 16 yards out how many times have we seen the net bulge over the years two chances there for Tottenham now that gives Spurs fans two and a half thousand to serve them up in the corner of the Johan Cruyff arena on the far side a little bit of hope but you're right Chris they've got the take them they cannot afford to see chances come and go like that. Trippie a long and forward but that just drifts straight out of play and Ajax still lead by that goal in the fifth minute from Matthias Deliq from the corner. He can only describe that pass from Trippie as a shank and he is moving very awkwardly and holding his right groin I do believe he's had problems in that area before but he's had a very shaky start to the game. Yes he has caught out or at least Deliqt lost Trippie for the the only goal of the night so far so let's just keep an eye on Kieran Trippie. I suppose the question is is Deliqt why is Alder Vierle not picking up Ajax's best header of a football? A very good question Free kick to Tottenham on the halfway line just in front of the where the managers are standing in their technical areas Maurizio Pochettino looks as though he's got the weight of the world on his shoulder at the moment. Alder Vierle to take this free kick. It's going to take it short back to Fautongan in the centre circle and then square towards in fact Tottenham are going backwards into their own half. I notice as we commentate here there's a couple of young people moving around the media area with a tray full of drinks have very thoughtful that is as Alder Vierle is going to play the ball all the way back to Hugo Lurries. Now to Fautongan inside the box passes it just in front of Dolberg out to the right hand side Alder Vierle and then Ericsson comes short Trippie back to Alder Vierle again struggling to get out here but it goes Delialli is beaten in the air by Deliqt stretch from Fautongan to headed to Delialli middle of the Tottenham half. This is rather unconvincing from Spurs here they're really unsettled by Ajax. A little bit too slow at the moment but we talked about Ajax at the start being fearless they're putting a high press on Spurs for that's better from Delialli. Lovely from Delialli, beats two men takes the ball on towards the edge of the penalty area Son low cross to Murat but it deflects off Murat back to Talia Fika who's able to clear to the halfway line but good again from Delialli and here Son on the right hand side receives the ball moves away from Blint, Ericsson centrally back to Sasoko on the right hand side Sasoko looks up low ball to Son near the edge of the penalty area first time touch to Ericsson Ericsson moving from right to left then rolls the ball to Danny Rose puts his foot on it plays it into Ziek and the ball spins away for what is Tottenham's first corner of the match. A better passage of play from Spurs and I tell you I know Ajax are confident playing well only takes a goal from Spurs right back in it and two to the through currently one nil on the night two nil on aggregate to the Dutch league leaders here the ball played in from the left hand side from the corner from Rose Lucas Murat off balance hits the shot but because he was off balance it just screwed away well wide of the right post and it's behind for a goal kick to Ajax who are leading by one goal to nil we'll have more from Darren Fletcher who's back in the five live studio Darren Fletcher played so many Champions League games from Manchester United Chris Sutton here in the stadium with me played so many Champions League games for Celtic and Ajax with the ball back halfway inside their own half and going all the way back to goalkeeper Onana who passes it out towards the far side long pass from Delict he's looking for the Dane Dahlberg through the middle who pulls the ball down and then in steps Alderv Irelts who's able to take the ball away from it. Sissoko passes the ball it takes a deflection Ziek and the ball runs back to Loris who's able to come out and pick the ball up on the edge of the penalty area and we'll hear from another former Manchester United man at half time by the way Phil Neville on the day that he named his England squad for the women's World Cup so Phil Neville at half time here is Sissoko down the right-hand side Blint turns follies it downfield ball into the full back position Alderv Irelts turns and then we'll clear the ball back into the box to Loris Loris to Fautongan on the edge of the penalty area then back into the six yard box to Loris who signals long has taken the ball right out into the left back position and does hit the long pass but guess who's underneath that delict well don't kick it on him he's there powerhouse the dominant one in the air at the back Loris kicks it straight down his throat and he hasn't missed a thing so far this evening just runs his fingers through that blunt hair as the ball bounces out of play on the far side for a throwing to Ajax who will go back into their own half the atmosphere is vibrant here show the Ajax supporters so many of them will have been confident positive hopeful for heading to Madrid where they'll play Liverpool or a Nana that's a mistake from the Ajax goalkeeper it's kicked the ball straight out of play for a throwing to Tottenham I was gonna say he's usually brilliant with his feet a couple of moments ago I'm glad I didn't here's Ericsson Ericsson infield towards Wanyama Wanyama moving from right to left and then incomes to Vanderbake with a challenge and then De Jong finds Ziek in the centre circle and Ziek's pass out to the left hand side to Tadditch who's cutting into the box now Tadditch against Aldervayra leaves him on the ground shoots right across the face of goal and narrowly wide of the far post and across for a goal kick well Spurs still in this competition by a matter of inches really poor play from Wanyama who's still down in the Ajax half took too long on the ball too many touches it was Vanderbake who stole the ball off him and then released Tadditch and this isn't a Tadditch I remember from Southampton in any way shape or form drives from the left hand side Aldervayra backs off and off and he just pulls the ball with his left foot from an acute angle narrowly passed the far right hand post of Larissa's goal so close Wanyama is on his feet he's okay Dhu San Tadditch has scored 34 goals this season and that is more that's many more than he scored across four seasons for Southampton 23 goals in four seasons for Southampton but he's just fitted in here perfectly 22 assists as well as his 34 goals incredible really and he's played a number of positions but mainly as a false nine there's always been a talented footballer just got a stoppage in play Chris at the moment I was wondering what was going on because Larissa's standing with the ball in the six yard box in his hands it's because the referee's microphone is not working and obviously that's absolutely crucial with VAR because he needs to speak to Bastion Dancott and Markle Fritz who are sitting in the video assistant room right they've got that sorted out Iax leading 1-0 BBC Radio 5 live 2-0 on aggregate Tottenham have had chances but the chances have come and gone Son who is is playing mainly on the left hand side Laura mainly through the middle here's Rose Rose incomes the challenge from Schoenach bounces out of play that's given us an Iax throw which Danny Rose protest strongly about throwing is taken and here is Frankie De Jong another of the Iax blonde bombshells back it goes to De Jong and the pass is deflected off son out of play for another throw to Ziek there on the far side it's actually going to be taken by Maizraoui we've played 32 minutes huge screens hanging from the roofs at either end of the stadium high above the two penalty areas little foul and a free kick to Dolberg nearly caught the ball there he has Son playing it in field to the halfway line to Ericsson Ericsson on his left foot passes it straight into Schoenach and now Iax again every minute the ticks by this becomes so much harder for Tottenham you know they've got to win here tonight cannot be extra time now incidentally so we won't have penalties we won't have that sort of drama Tottenham have got to turn this around a 2-1 win on the night would be enough for them with the two away goals but he has Muir on the right hand side daily blint in with a challenge that's good from the moment former Manchester United man and then blint 1-2 with Schoenach then blint to van der Beek and now Ziek in the centre-circle Ziek goes the pass to the right-hand side Talia Fiko Tadec near the halfway line just almost right next to where the coach Eric Kane Haag with his bald head is standing Tottenham win it back Ali his ball through towards the edge of the penalty area but De Jong was there and was able to unforese play the ball back to Onana and again it's with De Jong in the left back position De Jong just running the ball away still going Delhi Ali into the challenge then Van Yammer as well and he's upended and Danny Rose actually blasts the ball across the pitch and it hits the referee and he apologises immediately but a free kick for the foul on De Jong. Yeah I said De Jong he glides in possession he's got the feet of a ballet dancer he has an outstanding player started off as a centre half and read that situation when Spurs looked like they're getting in behind he has the absolute lot a range of passing knows when to run and when to play. Blint heads along ball for and it's headed away by Tribya Ericsson and then it's deflected and Blint is there feet of a ballet dancer famous dutch ballet dancers you can go first Onana to the halfway line where is Ali Bruce where is he he's in Valencia he has Van Der Beek takes it away from the halfway line Van Der Beek now Tadich is free on the left Tadich receives it he's into the box now pulls it back C-Hack left foot 2-0 Ajax they're on the way to the final this exciting young team of just torn shot number part again from the angle a left foot shot curled beyond the dive of Luris it's 2-0 on the night it's 3-0 on aggregate surely Tottenham can't come back from this. So long long way back for Spurs but what a finish from ZX the Moroccan magician really good play from Ajax down the left hand side and the ball is weighted into ZX 16 17 yards out on the angle and it's just rolled into his path and he whips the ball superbly across Luris who has no chance Luris floundering at that but what a player what a team what a moment you just don't see it for Spurs now it's a brilliant finish it really was clinical that's what Ajax have been that's what Spurs haven't been that's what they've lacked that clinical edge 2-0 on the night 3-0 on aggregate 3-0 when was the last time a team came from 3-0 down to go through in a Champions League semi-final there's a question for you less than 24 hours ago but this is completely different Chris this is now mammoth for Tottenham to get through well as the score stands they've got to win 3-2 nothing else nothing less than that will do so that would obviously mean that Ajax don't score again and here is Vandabake and ZX just scoring the second goal plays it to Tadda to just set that goal up he's on his right foot ball cut out by a stretching how the viral on the edge of the penalty area and here's Frankie De Jong who's going back into his own half just there as well cleaning everything up we've hardly mentioned Vandabake what an important player he is just plays in and behind the centre-forward will drift in make penetrating runs getting those little positions in between centre half and midfield another young top player kept hold of him linked with Roma strongly at the start of the season they are just full of it aren't they they are great seen inside the stadium here almost 55,000 people and in the end to our right where the bulk of the popular support is that's where the big drum is that's where only the boys with their shirts off are standing I mean it looks like that stand is moving on its own they're all dancing and celebrating and they really are thinking about an Ajax trip to Madrid now Ajax against Liverpool what would have been effectively a Johan Cruyff tribute night was cancelled last night with the prospect of Barcelona against Ajax in the final but it might well be that the club where Johan Cruyff really made his name will be there in the final Tottenham this is spur season John they've got Champions League football I don't think they have to worry too much about things turning around at the weekend they've just got to get one and hope yeah the chances that they've missed they've been costly because then Ajax have scored that second goal here's Ericsson trying to find his way through it's blocked on the edge of the box by Masraoui comes out this is so called chip or it's over the top of Son and now Ziek is there and he under pressure placed the ball out what about what about son on the left-hand side Lucas Moore in the middle do they necessarily need to change anything just yet Tottenham they've had opportunities haven't they and he's elected to start with son but son has drifted out to the right-hand side I just think that second goal has really knocked the stuffing out of Spurs they need to regroup Pocitino has gone to sit down on his seat just next to the mouth of the tunnel for the time being Ajax to Tottenham 0 Delhi Ali to Ericsson all lovely pass from Ericsson to Rose Rose chips into the back post and on the turn Calio Fico on this far side of the penalty area turns before Trivia could get there to clear it away on his left foot Tottenham need those moments to turn into clear chances when Ericsson set up Danny Rose on the left-hand side Trivia pulls the ball back and gives it back to Aldervayra 5 minutes to go to halftime just a little bit more than that plus added time song then back to Fatongan Aldervayra's five yards inside the Ajax half just beginning to shuffle forward so circle makes himself available packet goes to Fatongan in the center circle move the ball quickly because he's just taking a breather sitting deep letting Spurs play in front of them we know they will break really quickly when they win that ball back prospective a final between two English clubs in the Champions League is slipping further and further away all of the time may yet have an all English club final in the Europa League though will have that for you tomorrow night commentary and coverage from the second leg of the semi-finals from the Europa League this time tomorrow here on 5 live commentary from Valencia with Alastair Bruce ball and Don Hutchison with Arsenal and will also be at Stanford Bridge where Chelsea have their second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt that's five lives football commentaries and coverage tomorrow night top them 2-0 down here inside their own half Delhi Ali back to Sasoko Danny Rose has made a run into the center circle and Danny Rose now takes it on towards the edge of the box and gives it to Son who's touch was poor gave the ball straight away to De Jong and now it's up to cottage and I acts are breaking away again De Jong dummy to hit the long pass to Tadage goes back into his own half and gives it to the bearded Dane Schoenig they've been quite wasteful John haven't they Spurs in and around the I X box unlike some there heavy touch the I X defender that's a poor pass from Blink though giving the ball back to Tottenham Tottenham I mean how important how valuable how significant would a goal be for half time be for Spurs absolutely be you're looking for characters now just hang on in there they need a miracle Trippie up curling the ball forward Blink comes across gets there ahead of son who has popped up on the right hand side here but plays it downfield and Aldervire old under pressure from Dolberg has to play it back to his goalkeeper and Laurie's chips at away to the halfway line Masarowe wins that easily and then it's played for by Ziek but the ball will run away over the white line and behind for a goal kick to Tottenham who trailed 2-0 on the night 3-0 on aggregate Chris Sutton that Moroccan connection down the right-hand side it was an opportunity Ziek reverse pass left footed just over hit it looks a real threat doesn't he Ziek he does Tottenham oh Trippie a playing the ball across very nearly gave it to Dolberg Dolberg put in the challenge why you haven't been putting the challenge as well on Lassa sure now the two of them got there at the same time but that was that was a stout challenge from Cicilco and he's left a little bit on sure now who stayed down well I tell you what it was it was a terrible pass from Trippie who has been way off the pace sure now the day steals it off defend that and is a strong challenge from Wanyama free kick then for Ajax yeah as he stepped into the challenge just stepped on the foot the top of his left foot and it's a free kick too far to shoot I think from sure now sure now that's a sure number 20 is back on his feet remember he scored from a free kick against real Madrid plays it into the area it's headed across by delict and then headed out of play by Wanyama and behind and it is a corner for Ajax from the right hand side and they've got Tottenham here just exactly where they want them leading by two goals to nil on the night half-time approaching there'll be no hurry here to take this corner and we see the Tongan now edging over towards delict and Trippie it's very strange why does the Tongan just mark him I mean delict is cowering over Trippie it sort of underlines it really if you weren't listening earlier Trippie delict got away from Trippie in the scoring of the opening goal in the fifth minute corner is eventually taking shots the act plays it back then into the area by Masraoui headed away on the edge of the six yard box by Alderviral Tottenham break Lucas Moura plays it out towards the right hand side Cisoco gets there but the red and white Ajax shirts are dropping back into position and actually Cisoco goes back to Alderviral who chips it airily that's easy for the young to win in the air and it's headed out and down for a throwing fourth official is ready with his board it's been Ajax is half comprehensively they've scored two goals Tottenham have created chances Son hit the post with that effort from the angle Son had the chance saved Ericsson had the shot saved but the chances weren't taken and now where Tottenham are playing the ball back for Tongan to Loris Loris passing it beyond Ziyec Danny Rose now taking it on down the left hand side still going rose the back puts in the challenge to the ball but to the man as well free kick but that's what you're talking about intensity Ziyec shut the goalkeeper down and he must have ran back 70 yards sprinted hurtle back to get the challenge in on Danny Rose Alderviral long ball right down the middle right down the throat of an hour who can come out and catch the ball right in front of his face no problem at all to nil to Ajax by the way if you're listening to us on your way home you can carry on listening to our commentary while you watch five live final score by the BBC iPlayer tonight via the red button on your television or on the BBC sport website and app just look for five live final score to nil to Ajax added time at the end of the first half two minutes of out of time and here is van der Beek who wins the throwing off Ericsson and Ajax will allow the ball to roll out of play they won the cup final Ajax on Saturday they said it was easy four nil win against the Villains fair didn't celebrate I think it saw the article daily blintz saying his job done celebrated on the pitch then went home recovered and all the focus on this tie this game daily blintz I got a chance to speak to yesterday in the press conference I said to daily I hope for the BBC daily you give us an answer in English asked a long involved question and he gave me a full some answer in Dutch here's Ericsson double Dutch no just the single here's Cadditch and then Trippie is able to play the ball back yeah Trippie I'm sure will be singled out you know certainly in the scoring of the first Ajax goal but but otherwise as well he's not had the best of seasons Paul Hartley Danny Rose then into the challenge but the half-time whistle goes and here's the reaction that you can hear inside the Johan Trojfarina they approve and well they might they're winning 2-0 they're on the way to the final Chris looks that way Spurs needed miracle the worst possible start conceding from a set piece guess who scored it delict the young leader powering a header in and the second goal real quality from Zeik a long long way back for Spurs nigh on impossible but they have to hope they would have seen what happened last night they can turn this round you have to say you just don't see it no delict leading the way through grit from Ajax too good from Ajax 2-0 3-0 on aggregate here in Amsterdam Spurs fans won't agree Chris but they are an absolute joy to watch on the Ajax well yeah absolutely they have been all the way through this season and especially in this competition let's not forget the maturity they showed away from home against Real Madrid and Juventus played both teams off the park they are so assured they trust each other they've been absolutely fantastic I just wondered tonight you know your question you're trying to cling for things for Spurs you know that would they feel the pressure at home soft goal as it was the first one I'm not saying it settled Ajax down I think they play that way anyway but I mean they just look streaks ahead don't they and the biggest issue for Spurs any three goals but you can't can't sit here and say I can't see Ajax scoring again they are ruthless 167 goals that season that's two more goals than canals in Amsterdam thank you that's a that's a impressive stat and the impressive research as well just on the first goal Daraf Lechler alongside me that Chris called soft was actually clever by Ajax but also could have been disallowed I'm surprised it's not chappers you spotted it before me Vanderebeek is completely blocked for Tongan and the Licks got a free header because the Tongan was allocated to Licks wasn't it he was allocated to him so he's marking them all of a sudden just before the kicks taken Vanderebeek steps in front backs him blocks him the Licks gets a free header fantastic will work for my acts but with VAR looking it back I was expecting it to be disallowed but for whatever reason he obviously doesn't think it's a fail but it's a clear fail for me let me read some text Omar on Ajax these I X boys are simply these I X boys exclamation marks simply brilliant display of character from them under the leadership of a team it's crazy Max as a football fan watching Ajax play is a bit like going to a Michelin star restaurant for dinner yes it's just football but it's just beautifully done Jack not an anti spurs thing but this I X team were an absolute joy to watch it would do the Champions League a great service if a team that has spent as little as I X win the final in possession and out of possession you could just see how well coached and drilled they are listen everyone talk about I X in possession because the different spurs that looks like hard work when they're playing out I actually simple but their energy and their work rate is unbelievable you know no egos in the team they're all helping each other their pressman numbers they're stifling spurs the odd time spurs have broke through the press they have looked dangerous but it's very very difficult to watch them do it they know it's a struggle I X of put them under so much pressure but then amazingly when they went when they went to up they completely changed and they went into a low block and they let spurs pass the ball in front of them and now they're conserving energy because they know it's going to be a long game and spurs have to do something special now to beat them a second goal was fantastic as well what finish the way to pass from Tadich but what a finish from the lad you know he's got his head down and he's whipped the ball left foot and the back and it fantastic as the echo who is on Ramadan at the moment and actually after 24 minutes of that first half took a gel from the physio got to out once it got to after 15 minutes then that was able he was able to have some here did did say pretty much that he might go and get a drink at that stage but he was able to go and get a gel Anthony made no mistake about it this I act side could easily beat Liverpool to win the Champions League keep them coming 85058 out 5 live sport Fred Finn Jones I think since John one commentator of the air says Fred Finn Jones I don't know if you've seen this tweet to you John but I think since John has one commentator the year he's gone a lot more high brow I've been scratching my head at a few of the references that's all for Chris's benefit so I know that he appreciates that sort of brand to Jackson Pollock keep them coming 8508 at 5 live sport Iax 2 Tottenham nil at halftime an awful lot for Mauricio Pochettino's team to do in the second half and we'll bring that to you over the next hour so but first let's just pause for the news with Nick Hatfield on digital BBC sounds smart speaker and online this is BBC Radio 5 live the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have named their baby son Archie Harrison

is your football station this is five live this is five live your football station the UEFA Champions League with Mark Chapman Iax 2 Tottenham nil at half time three nil to the Dutch side on aggregate the second half on the way England squad has been named today head of the women's World Cup in France this summer they were announced in a unique way each of the 23 selects of players find out that they've been picked through a series of celebrity messages on social media so these were announced by the likes of Prince William Raheem Sterling and David Beckham it gives me great pleasure to be able to announce that England's defensive rock and captain Steph Horton will be on the plane to France Steph congratulations I know you and the team will do the nation proud Stanway Stanway as you know today is a big day today and I've been given the permission to confirm that you're going to France hi it's David Beckham here I just want to announce that Nikita Paris will wear the number seven shirt obviously it's a shirt that I wore for many years with pride it's a shirt that I kept in my country and so I know that Nikita will do exactly the same where this shirt with pride this is what Phil Neville thought about the way the squad was announced I think this watershed moment's been coming for a long time I think the growth has been incredible probably quicker than probably what people can sometimes handle but what I would say the work that the guys have done on the announcement today I think probably took my players breath away I've got to say that they were blown away with it it was surprised they did not know what was happening we wanted to reward them for what was has been a tremendous journey for them and to give them a platform individually to tell the world that they're going to a World Cup the World Cup is a pinnacle you know nobody should be embarrassed nobody should be shy about telling the world that you're going to a World Cup you know it's the announcements there it's been done everyone's excited about it now it's time to get down to work Vicki Sparks will be part of our commentary team for the World Cup and joins us now where were the surprises Vicki well I think the the squad chappers was was largely expected Steph Horton of course the Manchester City skipper leading the side no real big surprises in terms of inclusions and great to see Beth Mead in their very talented young forward impressed as Arsenal won the title this season she's one of 11 players who will be heading to their first ever World Cup and England really do have a plethora of young attacking talent the likes of Georgia's Stanway of Manchester City the PFA young player of the year Nikita Paris also of Manchester City has had a brilliant season as well Fran Kirby also makes it now she's been managing a knee problem recently but has been playing for Chelsea which is key and then you have the more experienced heads like Horton like Chelsea captain Karen Carney like Manchester City's Jill Scott so it's a really exciting blend of youth and experience and the main thing is the young players are still players that are winning things at the top level which will be important going into this tournament and despite as you said the 11 players who made their World Cup debuts they've still had international experience with things like the she believes cut absolutely I mean the she believes cut was such an important win for England that was the invitational tournament earlier this year hosted by the USA Brazil and Japan were involved as well and England won that for the first time and managed to get a draw against the USA who are the current world champions so yeah as you say they have experience at international level a lot of them played at Euro 2017 that was quite a few of those players first major tournament and they've been winning things at domestic level they've been going far in the Champions League over recent years particularly with Manchester City and the Chelsea players so these are not young inexperienced players who haven't been on the big stage the Manchester City side any player from that side is in the squad played at Wembley in front of 45,000 people last weekend in the FA Cup final so that as well will stand them in good stead going into this there are some big names missing though yes Leon midfielder is he Christiansen now she was probably the one who was closest to making the squad although it was touch and go in terms of if you predicted she'd get in probably 50-50 but Phil Neville says she's devastated now now she's been recovering from an ankle injury and Neville confirmed that she would have been fit for the tournament but others have impressed in her place while she's been out she was injured back at the she believes Cup it's a tough decision and I think he hasn't hidden behind the injury either he's been honest about the reasons for not taking her saying other players have stepped up in midfield but it's a big disappointment for her England's most cat player in the men's all the women's game Farah Williams also misses out now she hasn't been as involved in recent squads so not much of a surprise in that way but certainly she is an experienced player and certainly could have brought something to the squad she's 35 now Phil Neville adamant it's not the end of her England career says that she was unlucky to miss out the other big one Jordan knobs of Arsenal they've known she's been out for a while she's been out since November after rupturing her it was confirmed several months ago that she would miss the World Cup so she will be a big miss that they knew about anyway but England's have most of their top talent available and that's hugely important because Chappers it is going to be a very fiercely contested World Cup yeah but whilst it may be fiercely contested Phil Neville hasn't shied away from the fact that he wants them to embrace their chances of winning it I mean he's talking them up not talking them down absolutely and I think his attitude has been very positive in that respect he's very careful to say you know we're not going to win it but it's clear reading between the lines that they desperately want to make the final they had their best ever finished at a World Cup back in 2015 when they won the bronze medal had the agony of that late Laura Bassett own goal against Japan who are in their group this this World Cup so yeah they will definitely want to go deep into the competition but there's five or six teams who I think really have the potential to make the final you've got the current world champions USA you've got the hosts France will see this is a huge opportunity to put past values behind them Germany the Netherlands Australia perhaps the dark horses but absolutely England will be up there in terms of those teams that have a very good chance of making the final and a good chance of winning it Vicki thank you Vicki Sparks of the sport headlines England's first one day against Pakistan was abandoned due to persistent rain at the oval Pakistan reached 82 in the 90s and others that were possible Joffre archer took one of those wickets

Frankfurt tomorrow night commentary of Valencia against Arsenal though will be here on five live in the Europe Europa League semi-final second legs and the former Brentford boss Mark Warbison has now been appointed as the new QPR manager back to Amsterdam I guess first Darren Fletcher in the studio with me do you I mean what can Spurs doing this second half they just got to believe I wouldn't be surprised to see Laurenti come on they have to try something different now you know I absolutely they're going to sit in and try and out in the break and maybe a game for Laurenti now be direct get the balls forward they've got to try something either make the need of miracle need a bigger miracle than Liverpool had last night what you cackling at Chris I can hear you laughing in the background Darren's ahead of the game there Laurenti's waiting to come on all right well we haven't seen that we haven't seen the pictures genuinely we haven't been okay oh honestly we we have not who's he coming on for do you know looks like when the Emma right okay so they have son and more I decided of Laurenti would you Darren looks that way yeah they've got to go for it they've got to be direct as I said before when I scored a second goal they start to set a little bit deeper and Laurenti are causing problems especially on daily blend they've got to get balls in the box what they try first half didn't work they've got an uphill challenge now but they've got to go throw everything at it and give it one last big effort if they lose by four or five it doesn't matter they've just got to give it one they've got to just leave everything out in the pitch second half a tactical acumen in the studio here with Darren Fletcher Chris Sutton is alongside John Murray thank you Mark yes welcome back to Amsterdam Tottenham are out they've been out there for some time actually but we're still waiting for the IX players to to emerge IX leading by two goals to nil delict with a header in the fifth minute an excellent finish on his left foot from Ziek in the 36th so two nil on the night three nil on aggregate and Tottenham now well they've got to find something they've got to find some of the spirit of I don't know Bill Nicholson Keith Birkin Shaw Tottenham's European trophy winning managers players like Dave Mackay and Cliff Jones and Steve Perriman and Alan Mullery who've all scored goals in semifinals for Tottenham in Europe but they yet to find a goal in this semifinal and there's the confirmation from the board that it is Victor Wanyama who makes way and Jorente comes on so now the Tottenham team Chris Sutton, Loris, Trippia Alderviral, Fertonghenan, Rose, Cisoco and Ali, Erickson, Moura, Son and Jorente Yep and he's a Marigio Pocciudino has gone all in Wanyama and Cisoco the two so-called protectors in the first half for Tottenham looks like Erickson will go in now alongside Cisoco in that central midfield area but Lorente needs service he had no choice really got the hope they can get a goal early in this second half and go from there they have to believe they do Ajax to kick off at the start of the second half as they started the match with Anana in goal back four of Mas Raui, Delict, Blint and Talia Fico, Schöner, Vanderbake and De Jong in the middle and then Ziek on the right, Tadich on the left and Dolberg as the central striker after David Neres was ruled out with an injury in the warm-up so Dolberg came in to replace him for the start of the match a very loud announcement being made for the I presume the Tottenham supporters throwing to spurs immediately down the left-hand side Tottenham well obviously need an early goal apparently I've just been told that the top trends on social media in the UK at the moment are Ajax and Tottenham, Trippia, Ziek, Delict, Wanyama, Tadich, De Jong and Archie, I hadn't seen that at the bottom I wondered why I'd been given that here is Jurente plays it through into the penalty area stretch from Delict under pressure from Delia Li and it's gone straight behind for a corner yes a good turn from Lorenzo and he scooped the ball over Delict who actually read the situation well and he got a vital touch full stretch left-footed and goes behind Delia Li would have been in with an easy finish so it's a corner for Tottenham from the left-hand side set peace chance Tottenham need these need a goal Ericsson plays it in to the the post that's where Aldervireld was making his run but the two Ajax man men there I think it might well have been Delict who got the header away and now Trippia brings it forward but loses possession he's tackled Van der Beek across the field to the left-hand side to Tadich who just had to wait for the ball and in so in doing so the momentum then slowed and Tadich's passes beyond Ziek and through for Goldberg. There's a real opportunity as a can poor play from Trippia maybe an argument that he should have been hooked a half time 3v2 for Ajax the ball from Van der Beek was behind Tadich and the momentum was lost. 2-0 3-0 on aggregate so Tottenham really do need a footballing miracle here at the home of Ajax of Amsterdam the Johan Cruyff Arena where you really cannot avoid the image of Johan Cruyff all around this place there's an absolutely fantastic black and white photograph right at the top of the escalators here at the highest level of the stand down at the bottom there's a bronze bust of Johan Cruyff's face his influence is just across Ajax across Dutch football European football is immense it's like a monument to the man here is Lucas Moura on the halfway line who's challenged Van der Beek to the right here's Mazraoui Ziek comes short Ziek's pass straight at Danny Rose and Tottenham in the all-green the two-tone green kit playing from right to left in the second half as we look here high on the dressing room side of the ground play it forward forward now from there from Mazraoui but Tottenham have got that back in front of their own penalty area so 2-0 this goal 3-0 on aggregate so Spurs are looking here at having to win by three goals to two on the night three goals without reply Lucas Moura wriggling away from the challenge of Tally of Fico into the center circle to Danny Rose Danny Rose then shrugs off Ziek Rose takes it on he's on his left foot dinks it into the box but it's behind Delhi Ali the ornity on the far side of the penalty area puts his arms wide apart as if to say what why couldn't you find me Tottenham come again Ericsson on the right-hand side Ericsson Ericsson's curling ball into the box delict is there to hit it away on the half ball he rather scuffed the clearance but got it away in any case then fires the ball up towards Dolberg the blonde head dint bounces off him Tottenham have got it back and then exuberance from Dolberg he's straight into Rose and concedes a free kick yellow card comes out it was a late challenge but once again Tottenham wasteful in that final third Danny Rose good driving run opened up for him just that final pass as a nasty challenge from Dolberg Rose the Ajax forward number 25 is booked for that 2-0 and Tottenham with it on the right-hand side Kieran Trippier you know the fact that Kieran Trippier was trending on social media I'm sure he'll be receiving a great deal of criticism on there we obviously highlighted the way that he's played but it's not just been tonight has it his form this season just has been nowhere near his form last season here is Son on the left-hand side son takes it on turns back plays it back to Danny Rose behind him Rose puts his foot on the ball Son now is away he's managed to get away from Masraoui into the penalty area but the covering challenge from Schoenert still Son though Son to Deli Ali Deli stretches will touch back towards Cisoco Cisoco then into the centre circle to Fatongan Fatongan now to the right-hand side to Alderviral here is Trippier adjusts his body plays it in field towards Lucas Moura Trippier again and then Ericsson back closer to the halfway line Trippier now has space on the right but pulls the ball square in field to Cisoco Cisoco and Rose Rose 40 yards out now to Son on the left-hand side Son couple of stepovers into the box on his right foot but Ajax very quickly close him down two men were on Son there back to Rose Cisoco 30 yards out Cisoco the ball will roll all the way to the right-hand side to Trippier who pulls it back onto his right foot the cross is headed away near the corner of the penalty area Ericsson though wins it back with a header for Tottenham Alderviral joined the attack on the right-hand side on his left foot here's the ball in looking for Laurenti and it came off delicts head and flew away beyond the far post for a corner a really good period of possession force was walking the ball across the pitch I got Laurenti in now who is a physical presence he's good with his head they've got to give him the service corner then Ericsson to take it Ericsson waits the referee has just blown his whistle and is pointing at Deli Ali on the goal line Deli Ali there is Deli Ali standing right in front of goalkeeper Arnana here's Ericsson's corner the near post that's a comfortable easy header away by Frankie De Jong and then Danny Rose as man handbought Ziak and it's a free kick to Ajax halfway inside their own half and the referee points at Danny Rose just wondering whether he might have thought about a yellow card for Danny Rose for that. Yeah Ziak drew the foul I think that's the third corner though that Ericsson has taken Paul in is it the first man every time what about Kieran Trippier Chris what what's happened to him he's a shadow of the player he was maybe fatigued there's a player who's he's had injuries as well he has but he certainly lost his confidence and a really poor start to the game missed his first challenge but he's not the only one Trippier passing the ball nicely to Sissoko on the right hand side Sissoko takes it on and then lifts a ball into the middle Danny Rose pushing well forward again Rose manages to squeeze it to Son quickly has two men on him again but moving infield right foot shot blocked no buzz by Masraoui back to Ericsson Ericsson's teasing ball into the back post Delhi Ali with a chance super safe by Arnana on the volley the ball bounced up he shot goalwards from close range five or six yards and the Ajax goalkeeper made great ground to his left to push it away what's a pass from Ericsson picks out Ali defense splitting pass but Ali has to score that it's a brilliant save from Arnana corner then from the right hand side a stretching header from Urenta in between two Ajax men but headed it up and over the top haven't got time to miss chances now Spurs really haven't 36 37 minutes left he's six yards out on the six yard line needs to go back across the goalkeeper it's a good height from Arnana but if Delhi Ali goes back across he scores the goal was a gaping a confident Delhi Ali buries that so it remains 2-0 on the night and 3-0 on aggregate as Dolberg wins a free

his own half plays a crossfield ball to Moura who releases Ali he reverses the ball back to Moura drives into the box and it's all about staying calm they haven't been clinical enough so far Lucas Moura was then just a climber just a climber for Spurs some excellent composure there as well Delhi Ali not least the way that he beat the challenge that came in on him and just rolled the ball into

the challenge clears it away as he's put under pressure by Trippia Alda viral's got it back near on the half way line then high ball cross field deli Ali takes it down deli Ali drifts now away from Zia and deli Ali with a flourish passes the ball back to Alda viral Alda viral's ball to Trippia on the right-hand side son is there son back to Trippia puts his foot on the ball son makes a run little pass infield towards the soco near the corner of the box so soco turns onto his left foot but turns into trouble however the ball is taken up for Tottenham again by Fertonga and now Danny Rose again rose against Masraoui who is backing away roses cross edge of the area he has son in the D son sees Trippia Trippia in space on the right ball across your edge it's saved it's saved by another ball still in the box Lucas Moura now Moura turned his scored he scored it's a second goal for Tottenham and Moura has got spurs right back into this out of almost nowhere it's Ajax to Tottenham too beer is pouring down on us there are Tottenham fans behind us throwing plastic glasses of beer and what are that there's another one they're absolutely drenched but Tottenham fans celebrating because it's 2-2 3-2 on aggregate and I can smell beer well miracles do happen I don't know how Laurenti misses these two yards out it's on a plate for him and Anna saves and Shurnak tries to scramble the ball I tell you what brilliant feet from Lucas Moura hammers the ball into the back of the net and Ajax are panicking we've got a VAR goal check we've got a VAR check going on so player has not resumed Ajax have made a change and the right back Joel Veltman is coming on and it's Lassa Shurnak who has made way from the midfield so Mazra he's going to move into the midfield the check is over the goal is given the goal is confirmed it is Ajax to Tottenham to Lucas Moura scored twice it's 3-2 on aggregate Chris can't believe it we saw a miracle last night at Anfield and fair play to Spurs Ritual Pochettino, Gamble put Laurenti on and they are putting Ajax under all sorts of pressure. 15 ninth minute that goal was scored Lucas Moura scored twice in four minutes and now Chris what we said about the weight of expectation a test for this largely young team well they've been rocked back by Tottenham however here's Ziak rides the challenge Ziak shot kicks a deflection which took it wide of goal and behind for a corner. Well do you know what I think Ajax are thinking now we need to score again because Spurs are creating chances let's get back on the front foot. Apparently there is a row of Tottenham fans behind us and it was them that were celebrating and throwing the pier it's a corner Ziak to take it Ziak to the edge of the six yard box it's headed down and away by Llorente who was back in there in the middle of all that the second goal Llorente the chance that he wasn't able to score a save from point blank range by your Nana however Lucas Moura did ever so well to win the ball back the loose ball inside the penalty area turn on to his left foot and lash it in from seven or eight yards. Fantastic finish but I think it was seven euros fifty for a pint last night I wouldn't be wasting my beer. Here's Llorente now on his left foot shoots for goal and it's wildly wide and high and behind and he hangs his head. Well I've never seen him score from outside the box he probably has but with his weaker foot off balance and better serve give it to Moura he's the man in form. So it's on it's on for Tottenham they're still behind three two on aggregate but one more goal without reply and it would be Tottenham Liverpool in the final. It's played up towards Tadich who is shoulder to shoulder with Patongan and it is the Belgian who gets the touch behind corner Ajax. I'll tell you what now John you can smell the fear in this stadium they've had it in their hands Ajax. Don't smell the fear I can smell the beer. Zeeak here's the corner towards the back post headed down by Delik but Tottenham have done the job on him went down then the shot flies in from daily blink from 25 yards plus and it flew over the top of the crossbar. It wasn't far away good first touch allowed him to get the shot off. Bouncing ball a yard over Larissa's bar just watching the Spurs goal again it is an unbelievable piece of goalkeeping from Anana to block Llorente but then the scramble from Schoenig he panics Moura Composure personified finishes it off. We have less than half an hour to play. 2-2 on the night but here come Ajax and Zeeak with a chance that is wide on his left foot from 12 yards out the cross from the left from Taliofico perfect for Zeeak and he swept it wide. Good move down the left hand side pulled across Zeeak doesn't break his stride 12 yards out left hand side of the goal goes down his hands and these inches pass that far post Tottenham breathe a big sigh of relief. Now Tottenham come again Delhi Ali was so close to finding the pass through to Son it was intercepted and cut out by Delik though here's Sussoko Tottenham are now finding space all over the place son on the right son in the full back position into the box now two Ajax man there Trippias available here's the cross from Trippia headed down by Llorente comes back to look as Moura whose shot is deflected off to lift and wide and behind corner. What's the block from Delik? Llorente headed a ball breaks Moura 12 yards out hammers the shot Delik dives to his left hand side and the ball goes past for a Tottenham corner. This Champions League semi-final has just gone absolutely crazy to corner from the right for Tottenham here's the delivery and a stretch from Llorente it's headed up by Llorente. I thought it came off Blint. I think it did and that's a mismatch against Llorente he has caused problems physical presence get the ball into him Moura buzzing in and around him the spurs on the offensive two two and it's a gold kick for Ajax and the referee is onto this telling Anana to get on with it Ajax are looking to waste time by the way everything seems to be calm behind us where the Tottenham fans are in the stand in amongst the Ajax fans they threw the beer but everything seems to have been quite cordial in all honesty. It wasn't cordial though. Here's Trippie I can still smell it but my notes are soaked. Here's Trippie forward to Deli Alley. Deli Alley on the left hand side they've come to life now Tottenham here's Sone he's popped up on the left hand side Sone is away between two Ajax men into the box challenge came in the ball bounces back to the edge of the area and the referee has given that. A push from Sone. A bit harsh. He's looked at danger off the left-hand side. Chris quickly because we haven't got a chance. Darren Fletcher in the studio mentioned about the first goal that Deli scored but maybe BAR could have picked that up for a foul by Vanderbake on Fertongan. I don't think it was clear and obvious I think the bigger issue for Spurs is why was Trippie picking up Deli and not Fertongan and Fertongan was wrong side of Vanderbake anyway. Tottenham are in the mood now Ericsson with a long pass forward to Urenti. Urenti square to Deli Alley. Ajax are chasing shadows here. Deli Alley now to the man the two-goal man Lucas Moura. Trippie is arriving on the right-hand side. Trippie has cross hits the defender. Talia Fico and deflect behind. Past the near post and behind for Kona. I thought for a moment there it might fly into his own net. It's Alio. It's Spurs with the courage in this second half. They've been down and out in this competition before. Just one goal. Son swells the ball in from the right but we're beyond anyone inside the penalty area. He was looking for Urenti. Urenti just made a late across to him and we will see another Ajax change. Eric Ken Hark is concerned about what he's seeing here. Already Schoenert has been withdrawn and now it's going to be Dolberg who is making way having been drafted in right at the last moment to start this match when David Nere has picked up an injury. And it is Daly Sinkgraven who's coming on who can play left back. He can play in midfield and he's going out there to the left-hand side. The number eight Netherlands under 21 international. Here's another young young prospect Sinkgraven. Another versatile player and Taditch goes. Up in the centre forward or false nine role. Ajax two. Tottenham two. Tottenham have come from two nil down. Two Lucas Moura goals in the 55th and the 59th minutes of the match. We have delict playing the ball to Daly Blint who's past is out of play and suddenly they are rattled here Ajax. And if Spurs get another I mean could this eclipse Liverpool from last night? I would say no but it's not far short. The ball comes back to Alderviral. Turns and gives it to Lorese. We're into the last quarter of the match now. Jurenti wins a header. Daly Ali it flicks his heels actually and bounces back. Jurenti has then beaten to it by De Jong. Now van der Beek. Van der Beek to Ziak. Ziak back onto his left foot. Clays the ball back towards the halfway line and then De Jong. The touch from Masraoui. Masraoui now to the right-hand side to Ziak. Ziak rolls it across Masraoui in the box. Turns, shoots, hits the shins of Katongan and then Danny Rose is able just to touch it away. However Ziak's back in possession going around the outside of Rose and then Daly Ali puts in the challenge but the flags up. They went out for a throw in. And now Daly Ali just needs to keep us cool here because he's walking past Ziak who's clearly had something to say but fortunately he has been sensible enough just to move away from the situation. It's getting hot in here isn't it? What a tension. Ziak and Ali. Ziak pointing the finger at Ali but he had run the ball out of play. Ajax 2, Tottenham 2, 3-2. Tyaks in the second leg of this semi-final. Liverpool waiting. They'll be in Madrid on June the first. We'll be there as well. Five live for the commentary on the Champions League final. This time tomorrow night Europa League semi-final commentary live from Valencia with Alistair Bruce Ball and Don Hutchison. Valencia Arsenal and will also be at Chelsea for their second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt. One more goal without reply and we would have a Champions League final involving two English clubs. Here's De Jong. De Jong to Vandermake who under pressure from Fertong and managed to find the pass to Masraoui. Masraoui now. Ziak left-footed, clips it to the back post. It's tested down by Taditch and Tribia makes a crucial interception to put it behind for a corner. Well why didn't Taditch leave that to St Graven who was behind him and would have had a free head as a lovely ball from Ziak who chops inside on the right-hand side and just feeds it into the far post. Taditch I thought he should have left it. But getting some answers now though from Ajax they've recovered after the jolt of those two goals. Ziak with a corner, delict heads it across the penalty area away by Lucas Moura then headed back by St Graven to Ziak. Ziak's cross, Laurie's comes he gets a hand to it, delicts and the penalty area on the right-hand side, delicts right in across, Laurie makes the save he pushes it out into the penalty area and he's fortunate there that it fell to a top-n-foot to clear. Oh I think Larisse gets lucky twice, flaps at the first one and just pushes it to delict. It's a good cutback from delict fired across and Larisse gambles, gets a right-hand to it, pushes it centrally into the box but Tottenham scramble clear. One of the last 20 minutes now the Ajax supporters the crowd here in the Johan Cruyff arena trying to do their bit and see the team through to the Champions League final. They're edging it just at the moment but that is all it is and here now Ajax with the ball on the left-hand side and oh a challenge by Trippier on the edge of the box they're howling for a free kick referee Brick says no and Tottenham clear it downfield. Well I think he tries to buy that Ducan Tadich on his way down. Ajax start again, daily bling thought he passed it out of play but it was kept in by St Graven then the ball through the middle for Tadich, Fatongan goes across with him a back heel by Tadich but he rather telegraphed that and Aldervayral was able to put it across the field. The ball was offside Tadich initially eventually the flag goes up but Ajax have responded a little bit they're trying to get another goal they just leave the backdoor open for Spurs. Free kick to Tottenham on the edge of their own area I suspect Lucas Moura will now be trending ahead of Archie, poor Archie, he's just been born, he had Victor Wanyama trending above him in the first half. Here he's off the field now though so he'll probably have dropped down the pecking order. The ball played back by Ajax to daily bling, we're setting ourselves for what could be a dramatic finale to these two nights of Champions League semi-finals that have provided some thrills and spills for us haven't they? Here's Aldervayral playing the ball back towards Laurie's alone red and white Ajax flag with the the image of the great warrior, the mythical warrior Ajax right in the middle of it. Here Tripier plays the ball forward, lovely from Llorente takes the ball down gives it to Deli Alli, Deli Alli's cross into the shins of delift straight behind corner to Tottenham from the right. Well that they're playing to his strengths Llorente has a lovely ball into him but he takes it on his chest on the heart and slides the ball into Alli who fires it off deli and wins the corner. He's changed the game, Llorente, since he came on even though these missed chances, he's had an awful shot at goal, it's what they call a curate egg. Here's Tripier, Tripier with the corner headed to the new post, wide of the far post by Aldervayral. Kets up well, it's a good corner, outswinger from Tripier, pace on the ball, Aldervayral level with the near post, six seven yards out, just can't get it on target and Anana, he's not rushing. Archie's hanging in there, apparently on the trending, Anana's now involved, it's a goal kick to Ajax and Anana is taking his time, television cameraman appears from nowhere in front of us and walks along in front of our bench, they're beginning to move towards their positions for the end of the match, that's a concern for Tottenham, they need another goal, here's Deli Alli, Cisoco, Cisoco plays it past De Jong and he's away from him and Cisoco gives it to Lucas Moura, right side of the area, it's pulled back and it's cut out by Sinkgraven who is arriving back, Tottenham, the offside flag is up, it was played towards the halfway line but Fatongan got there first. Once again it's the powerhouse Cisoco driving from midfield, Rolises Moura right hand side of the box, I was wondering is it an angle whether he could have got a shot off, decided to pull it back, Sinkgraven, right place, right time to clear the ball. 2-2 is the score here, it's BBC Radio 5 Live, 3-2 to Ajax on aggregate and we are now into the last 15 minutes or at least we are now, he has Loris chipping the ball away, here to the left hand side, Rose takes it down, Reds your pochettino stalking around down there, ball intercepted by Masarawi, Rose was a little heavy with this challenge from behind on Z-Act, no free kick, most displeased by that, that looked like a handball by Danny Rose and it was and Rose bounces the ball into the pitch, bounces the ball at the referee actually and it bounces over his head and that's a yellow card for Danny Rose. It's just Dar from Danny Rose because it just allows Ajax to take the stink out of the game, Spurs in the ascendancy, it was a handball, you can't catch the ball Danny, but then he punches the ball, picks it up, punches it into the floor, just allows Ajax to try and regain a bit of composure. Here is Rose, now free kick from Delic, who has hit straight at him, Rose up towards Llorente, might have been hauled over there by Daley Blint, lovely from Sissoco to go past Daley Blint, Sissoco then very nearly passed Veltman to who just managed to get the touch, the substitute and now it's back with Onana who will clear, the time seems to be whizzing around for Tottenham, just feel the way the game is going, they will create at least one more chance, here is Christian Eriksen on his old home ground, oh Danny Rose is then taken out, cut the ball back, Ziek arrived, took a shins away, it's free kick and that's going to be a yellow card for Ziek, that's been some tussle, Ziek and Rose, it's clever from Rose, draws Ziek in, just chops back, left footed onto the ball, Ziek fouls him, but I tell you this stadium now is getting nervy, the pressure is on for Ajax, can they see it through, Spurs don't know when they beat, that's Chris Sutton with us on 5 live, so much Champions League experience, we've got Darren Fletcher alongside Mark Chapman back in the studio who played so many Champions League games with Manchester United, we'll have more from him at the end of this game, we'll try and get you the thoughts of Mauricio Pochettino as well and as I say Europa League commentary, Valencia Arsenal tomorrow night on 5 live, ball up towards Llorente, near the edge of the box Llorente is picked up for a foul on Blint, Llorente is a big guy, it's a lovely weighted diagonal ball into him and all he does is trying to hold his ground and he catches Blint with his right arm, I don't really see how that's about, he's allowed to fight for his space, again Anana taking his time, 2-2, 3-2 to Ajax on aggregate, have you enjoyed our commentaries this week, join us on Sunday as well for the last day of the Premier League, throwing two Tottenham rows up towards Gallialli, now here's Son on the left hand side, Son turns back towards the halfway line and gives it to Fatongan, on 5 live Sunday we will have commentary on Brighton Manchester City, on 5 live Sports Extra, Liverpool against Wolves, but the whole picture will be covered for you, here is Sissoko, Sissoko and then loses possession, and on the halfway line Tadic, Dusan Tadic, the 34 goal Tadic, gives the ball to Sinkgraven, now back to Vandabek who hits the shot, that's blocked by Fatongan on the edge of the area, Vandabek turns, gives it back to Sijek, left foot shot, hits the post and comes out and rows clears, so close to a third goal on the night for Ajax, oh rattle's off, Larissa's left hand post, is that the breaks Spurs need? Hit the post in the first leg through Neres, that was important, Zeeek there, his shot striking the upright and bouncing out and now Tottenham winning the ball back inside Ajax territory, but that's a foul by Lucas Mora, he wins the ball Lucas Mora, but these two teams are now just slugging it out, Ajax go forward, Spurs go forward. They are going at it, Hammer and Tong, Ajax with a free kick, 10 minutes to play, I think some more Tottenham fans are actually, are they being moved out to down to the left? It's a beer fest isn't it, just beer everywhere. Cisoco back towards Ericsson, Ericsson goes for a high long ball, Delict is under that, heads it out here to the right hand side, Veltman has cleared it straight to Ericsson, Ericsson now into the path of Deli Alias stretch, but Veltman got in there first, wins it back inside his own half, he has Van Der Big, his pass to Zeeek, what a brilliant touch from Zeeek, running up for Tongan now, Zeeek back to Tadditch, for Tongan, excellent challenge. What a challenge from Tongan, great driving run from Zeeek, out of the right hand side, releases Tadditch for Tongan, had to get that right. Oh and then Zeeek is all over and hacks down Danny Rose, Zeeek has just been yellow carded, Tottenham are going to make another change, Kieran Kripia is coming off and Eric Lamella is making his return from injury, Eric Lamella who's had quite a spell out with a hamstring problem, not played in the last 11 matches, remember him scoring in the Champions League at Wembley against Barcelona, Eric Lamella, where's he going Chris centrally, I think he is, yep he's going centrally, Mora has gone out to the right hand side, Laurenti on the edge of the area, heads it down, here's Lamella, into the action, straight into the action, gives the ball to Son, Son now, Lamella has made a run across the penalty area to the left hand side, Lamella, still Lamella, back it goes to Danny Rose, we're into the last 10 minutes now, Deli Ali lays it off to Lamella just outside the day, change of feet, Laurenti in the box, Laurenti back to Lamella, just intercepted by Daily Blint and cleared away, so close, that would have been a clear chance if he'd been able to thread it through, Ericsson's ball in, folly away by Daily Blint, leaning back and Ajax are creaking here, well he's using all his experience there, Daily Blint, two crucial interceptions, Cisoco's gone to right back, four spurs, Ben Davis is going to come on next, Mauricio Pochettino has his arm around the Welshman on the edge of the coaching area, Ajax, Taddage, high foot from Taddage, that's a free kick, they don't like that, either inside the arena, and Tottenham wanted to take the free kick quickly, but it's Danny Rose who's coming off, perhaps mindful of the fact that Rose and Ziak are in a right tussle here and both of them are on a yellow card, and fresh legs, Davy slotting in, that left back, what is it, how many minutes, eight minutes for Spurs to get something that's unbearable, the tension in this stadium, Son on the left hand side, Tempers are just raised to our left here, Ajax fan actually with a steward who are exchanging views, it's like that, Tempers' tension is high, Alderviro to Cisoco, who as Chris Sutton says is taken over right back or at least on the right side, Alderviro, Costa for Tongan, we're in the 83rd minute here in Amsterdam, Tottenham must score and not concede, and they'll be through to the final, right now it is Ajax going through, but St Graven has lost the ball, Lucas Moore into the box, Lucas Moore is deflected back to Llorente, Llorente on to his left foot, he's crowded out and Vanderbake will pass it away, it's seen for all the world, it was about to open up for Spurs and then a foul, Davy's wins the ball, I'll tell you what Llorente, what an impact he's made, just can't quite get the shot off, crucial interception from St Graven, Ziek, I think Davy's pinches the ball off him, he goes down Ziek, Jarente's made life really tough for daily Blint, he has the smart move peeling on Blint, you can't cope with his physicality, but at the moment is Ajax who are going through, but we have had well at halftime it was three nil on aggregate, we weren't expecting this, great credit to Tottenham, two goals from Lucas Moore, the first Tottenham player to score in a European semi-final, since Mickey Hazard, Davis heads the ball away to Song, Veltman is all over Song, that's a free kick, they're howling again in the stands and Frankie De Jong runs towards referee, break, just feel they're losing a little bit of composure Ajax here, yep, seen him like that, De Jong animated, they know what's at stake here, both teams do, Tongan goes long, Jarente again up against Blint, chest sits down, bounces away and Ajax are able to clear, Vanderbake now, as Ajax looked the breakaways, Crossfield pass was deflected, Ziek who's a real danger man, scored one, hit the post with another that would have finished it, surely, Ziek again, one-twos, now Talia Fico is going to get involved, the left back is marauding forward, gives it to St Graven on the left hand side, St Graven, Ziek is there, corner of the box, Ziek across the edge of the penalty area, that was quite a heavy challenge by Alderviral on the left back, Talia Fico is now out of the game, no free kick, Tottenham bringing it forward, they're bringing it forward down the left hand side, we have just five minutes to play, plus added time, great Champions League drama here on Five Live in Amsterdam, Shasoko on the right, back it goes, near the halfway line to Alderviral, now Ericsson, Ericsson, composure from Tottenham here, Alderviral receives it, shuffles forward, gives it to Shasoko on the right hand side, Shasoko's ball hitting, does reach Son, Son in the box on the right, Son shoots, outstretched foot of Talia Fico deflects it wider than the opposed, corner again to Tottenham, yes good from Son inside the box, she's trying to create an angle on the right hand side and fire across in another corner to Spurs and they've looked at threat from set pieces now, Laurenti's on, ball about the delivery, remember the corner at the Etihad, the controversial goal that was scored by Laurenti, let's keep our eyes on him, he's near the penalty spot at the moment, Lamella with the delivery this time, Ericsson with the delivery, here it goes, Laurenti gets his head to it, it's headed against the crossbar by Fertogun, it bounces down, Fertogun can't force it over the line, now Tottenham have hit the frame of the goal, are they going to get a better chance than that Spurs, Lucas Moura high ball into the box, O'Nanna's come with a punch, he's punched it straight to Lamella, he gives it back to Ericsson, Ericsson less than five minutes to go, Fertogun just hit the crossbar, still Ericsson finds a little space to give it to Lamella, Lamella edge of the D, rolls it across to the left hand side to Son, Son now inside the box, the crowded box, Son shoots from the angle, high over the angle of post and bar, goal kick, the angles against Son, little step over, then the right hand side, sales feltment, narrow angle and it goes over but the chance was from Fertogun, he's got the score, he hits the bar, he's four yards out, it's a coming together Laurenti, I think it's the leg that the ball just floats, it hangs in the air and Fertogun, that was the chance for Spurs needed. Just seeing a flash up on the board, Tottenham had 20 attempts at goal to Ajax's 13 but are they going to get a better chance than that one? We're in the 88th minute here, Ajax 2, Tottenham 2, 3-2 to Ajax on aggregate, Onanna with a goal kick, Deli Ali heads it forward, Dalia Fico out there, Lucas Moura, caught Lucas Moura on the follow through, the ball bounces on the halfway line, Deli Ali's been fouled, 87.5 minutes played, free kick, Ericsson trots across to take base, huge huge moment, a place and the Champions League final is at stake here in the next few minutes, do not go anywhere, it's Ajax's at the moment, Ajax Liverpool, one goal for Tottenham without reply, it would be Tottenham Liverpool in Madrid, Ericsson across to Davis, Davis takes it on, floats the ball in, that's headed across the box by De Jong for Ajax and then Vanda Beg just dumps it high into the centre circle, oh Ericsson gets a touch and he steered it out of play for a throw to Ajax down the left hand side, that's a break, that gives them a break, they're waiting to make a change as well, Ajax, which will be their second change, I think it is, and it's Magashan who's coming on the Argentine central defender, throwing for Ajax, Frankie De Jong is going to take it down towards the corner flag, Tottenham have got it back, Alderviral, 88.75 minutes played, the bounce is out of play for throwing to Tottenham inside their own heart, here's the substitution then, Vanda Beg is sacrificed to bring on Magashan, Lisandro Magashan, who whether he goes into central midfield or whether he takes a place at the back, let's just see, to throw in to Tottenham, Cisoco is waiting to take it, I think they're trying to get a bit of physical presence on Magashan, Spurs have been quite direct, Vanda Beg has still got ten yards to get off the pitch and eventually on he comes, looks as though he's going to take his place in the back line and in fact Daily Blint is being moved forward into midfield and Magashan at the back, here it is forward, 89 minutes and 45 seconds, see how long there will be added on, Tottenham must score to get into the Champions League final, Ajax are going through, five minutes of added time, Ericsson back to the halfway line, Gronz as everyone sees, five minutes go up on the big screens, Fertonga forward to the edge of the area, Lucas Moura wins the header, Caliopico allowed it to bounce, Calioli was almost onto it, he was cleared away and now Lamello has lost possession, Ajax played forward towards Tadic, Tadic up against Fertonga, takes it to the edge of the box, slips it through, Fricky De Jong, but across comes Aldervayrault to block it behind, corner Ajax. It was good for Mike, it's a lovely weighted pass from De Jong, the centre of the park releases Tadic, De Jong carries on his run and Tadic releases him right to the side of the box for Tongan, gets back, Ajax are going to take the time with this corner, keep the ball in Tottenham's half. In actual fact they don't have anyone in the penalty area, Ajax, they have a corner and everyone stayed back, Bar, the corner taker, Ziak and Tadic is going across to take it short and he's miscontrolled it, he was trying to shield it from Eriksson, he's miscontrolled it straight out of play, we've already had one minute of the five minutes of added time, Tottenham must score, otherwise they're out in the semi-final. Davis cuts the ball back against Ziak, he's got space in front of him, Ben Davis opens his legs now but his pass is cut out by Daily Blint now in midfield, Ziak loses out to Deli Ali inside Ajax territory, Eriksson plays it across towards Alderviro, Alderviro's going to go for the long ball, there's no one on the left wing, he's past it straight out of play and he screams at Ben Davis for not being there. That's wasteful, Alderviro, there's still time for Spurs, there is time, Ajax trying to kill the game, no rush for Ajax, can they see it through? Throwing is going to be taken by Veltman, the noise here is intense, the atmosphere is just tense, Veltman with a throw, Ziak back to Mazraoui, spotted the run through the middle, St Graven is up against the Soko, it's one against one, St Graven plays it across, Ziak is in, Ziak to win it, saved by Larisse, bounces out to Tadich, Tadich curls it, wider the far post, Hugo Larisse has just kept Tottenham in this semi-final for the final minutes. It's a big save down to his left hand side, brilliant strike from Ziak, Spurs quick punt up the pitch, comes back at Tottenham now, Alderviro is under it for Tongan, two minutes, almost three minutes of the five of added time, it's gone long for Spurs, Murat beating to it by De Jong, Talia Fico, overhead kick away, Sissoko, Chess sit down, in comes the challenge from St Graven, for Tongan sticks out a leg, sends the ball forward, now Lukas Murat, Ziak the ball won't come down, Lukas Murat, Pog prods it forward and then across is De Jong to see it out of play, we're into the fourth minute of five of added time, if it's going to come for Tottenham it's going to come late, Ericsson up to Llorente, tried to flick it on, only half cleared, Deli Ali nods it back across the box, Deli heads it away, Ericsson, Ericsson sees Lukas Murat arriving on the right, back to Ericsson, he's shot blocked behind, corner. Daily Blindu gets the block and really well worked from Spurs, quick one two right down side of the box, Ericsson, you can't let him shoot from there, Daily Blindu all over and this is it, this must be the last chance, Loris has come up, the goalkeeper's coming up, this is it, this is the chance, this is Spurs' chance from the corner, Ericsson, high towards the penalty spot, you're edging with the header over, high and over, in between two Ajax men, we have played four minutes of added time and it's a goal kick and Ajax are 60 seconds away. As Loris goes forward it's an out-swinger from Ericsson, it actually looked at one stage like Loris may get on the end of it but Llorente got up, just couldn't direct the header on target. And Ana says the ball that he's been given isn't the right ball and he's thrown it away Is that it again? The ball boy's given him another ball, he's been yellow carded, the referee's run across and then he threw the ball away again and he's got another one and it's a goal kick so referee break has to add on another minute, surely. 20 seconds to go, the goal kick, downfield from Ajax, stumped back into the Ajax half, delict wins the header, then Zieg beaten to it by Davis, Son, back to Sissoko, long and forward and high, five minutes of added time are up, Gaglialli slips it through, he's just won it, he's won the semi-final right at the very end, oh what incredible drama, they can't come back from this, Ajax players are flat on their faces all over the pitch, Bocciatino has run onto the field, he's down on his knees, Lucas Moura has scored a second half hat trick, Lucas Moura is right at the bottom of a pile of top of Hotspur, they're going to the final, they are going to the Champions League final to play Liverpool, I cannot believe it, it is extraordinary, I've never seen anything like it, I really haven't, Spurs have been gallant, they've been bold, the rentes caused problems, just a lovely touch from deli Ali, a death touch outside of the right foot, Moura's got so much to do, still left footed, precision into the far corner, unbelievable from Spurs, they just don't know when they're beat, Lucas Moura right now, play has not restarted yet, Mouritio Bocciatino was down on his knees on the pitch, praying, I don't know, for whatever gods it is who have seen Tottenham through here, Lucas Moura with a hat trick, Tottenham are winning 3-2 on the night, Amsterdam is in shock, the Ajax players can barely get ready to kick off, it's all changed right at the end, Ajax are going out, we will have kick off, they've lined up on the halfway line Ajax with rugby formations, eight men, they take the kick off, all eight men run forward, we're still playing, daily blend forward, couldn't find delict, son in with a challenge, Ajax now know that if they score they'll be going through and we are now into the eighth minute of added time, deli Ali has bundled off the pitch by Masrawi, throw in, there will be time to take this, I think referee Brick was telling Ajax how long he was going to play, you know, well virtually everybody in the box, Veltman got a long throw on him, it's not over yet, Veltman with a long throw, a second take, here it is into the penalty area, it bounces down, Thor Tottenham, it's cleared away, just keeping an eye on the referee as Tottenham Lamella's lost possession, delict plays it across, that's headed away on the edge of the box by Llorente, Tottenham are off again on another counter attack, still we play on, still it goes, Lucas Moura then forward to Cisoco, Sons in the middle, Cisoco challenged by Blint, that's not a free kick, it's the final whistle, Tottenham have done it, the staff all run onto the field, Mauricio Pochettino walks across and shakes hands with Eric Tenhaag who must feel shell shocked, the Ajax coach, but what a night, what a second half for Tottenham Hotspur, for the first time Tottenham are in the Champions League final and they celebrate wildly and well they might, the match completely turned around in the second period, they're dancing, Tottenham players are dancing on the pitch here in Amsterdam, they're going to play Liverpool in Madrid, come on you Spurs, unbelievable, resolved belief character, Pochettino went all in, second half Llorente up top but Moura was the man, what a finish, clever touch from Ali, absolute bedlam, bedlam in here, Ajax two Tottenham three, three three on aggregate, Tottenham go through on the away goals rule and on the first of June in Madrid, will be there for Tottenham, Liverpool at half time, you could not have believed we'd be saying that, well you know you talk about last night Liverpool making the impossible, possible and Spurs again tonight, half time they were out, they were done but so many times in this competition they have dug deep, they don't know when they're beaten, this Spurs side have just showed so much character determination, resolved they've been stretched all season, the main man Harry Cano but they've got there, they've got there in the end, Spurs are in a Champions League final as they say, scenes, Mauritial Pochettino all in black, is walking around, he's hugging anyone who will hug him back, all of his coaching staff, the players are still there on the far side of the field, Lucas Moura, he's got the match ball and he's written himself tonight with the Champions League history, hat trick into Tottenham's history, Miracle Moura and the Tottenham fans up in the corner celebrate and the Ajax players now are going to their supporters who are applauding them and cheering them to the heavens and in the end the weight of expectation and the way Tottenham played in the second half meant that Ajax have fallen just short after their Champions League campaign began in July, it ends here in May but Tottenham will go to Madrid in June and what a night, what a another extraordinary incredible, stupendous, magnificent night of Champions League football, Ajax two, Tottenham three, Mark Trappman, pick the bulls out of that. Mauritial Pochettino is in tears, he's walking around the pitch in the Jankreuz stadium in tears, hugging his players, hugging his backroom staff, taking the applause of those Tottenham fans who have gone out there, I can't think of seeing another managerial reaction like that Darren, it's remarkable and understandable and actually a joy to see that emotion and that feeling. It's unbelievable as you say, he's crying like a baby, he's actually sobbing, he was on his knees when they scored the goal, unbelievable to see as you say, it gets you emotional watching him, how much this means to him and what he's done tonight respires, it's unbelievable to see a manager like that, the reaction they've got as well, it's incredible. Social media's gone in to melt down, I can't read any of them out because they're all swearing and therefore I notice your technique, Chris, you just shouted and screamed quite loudly to make sure you got all your swear words out of your system before you could then analyse the Lucas Mora goal, I know what you were doing. You know what, I should have been allowed to swear, I've never experienced anything like that, I've watched the Liverpool game on television last night, I mean Tottenham just dragged themselves up, they kept going and going and going and you just thought time was out for them, but all season in the Champions League they've been special haven't they, they really have, I mean the scenes here are just incredible, how have they done this, I really don't know but testament to the manager, testament to him for making the change and testament to the players for just you know for their sheer guts, they just kept going and going and going and got their reward against a top young team. Mauricio Pochettino is with his players now in the corner where the Tottenham fans are all up in the second tier in that corner and he's peeled away and he's pointing at himself and then pointing at the players and he's backed away and he's worshipping, he's giving a sort of worshipping motion to encourage the supporters to give the players their due for what they've achieved in the second half here and the hugs and kisses go on and the contrast inside the stadium here between those in green and the Ajax players who have actually now moved back, they're doing a lap of honour here, the Ajax players and they're actually mingling now with the Tottenham, I mean all of them down there have contributed to the night that we've seen here and Pochettino himself, you know the great Bill Nicholson, he couldn't reach a European cup final, Pochettino becomes the first Tottenham manager to do that and after this season that they have had to be in a Champions League final and let me remind you we were with them right at the start of this run mark, lost a way to Inter in the group match, then lost at Wembley to Barcelona, then got a draw if you remember that one against PSV, needed to go to Barcelona and get something, they got the draw against a weekend Barcelona team but then what happened at the Etihad with the late drama there, the Raheem Stirling goal that seemed to have knocked them out, yet they lived on and here I think the clock ticked up to the end of the five minutes of added time when Lucas Moura scored that clincher.",
