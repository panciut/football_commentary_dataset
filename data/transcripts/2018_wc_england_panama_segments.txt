[0.00 - 5.76] P:1475.03 E:0.277182 |  I hope the pictures are working a little better than the televisions of the commentary positions which have all gone on the blink
[6.16 - 7.76] P:1663.17 E:0.270003 |  at the moment, but
[7.76 - 14.60] P:1556.14 E:0.275431 |  Here we are ready now then for England's second match at World Cup 2018 here in Russia
[14.80 - 17.90] P:1532.06 E:0.277641 |  Just waiting for the teams to walk out the bearers of the flags

[23.00 - 26.36] P:1703.51 E:0.308825 |  They've never been brought out together for a senior international before
[26.76 - 28.76] P:1731.87 E:0.299748 |  And out now come the
[28.84 - 36.72] P:1740.85 E:0.304545 |  Officials and the teams and actually the the ball girl who has picked the ball off the plinth and given it to the referee
[36.72 - 38.72] P:1664.99 E:0.304519 |  In fact, she's still got it now is turning around
[38.72 - 41.84] P:1585.79 E:0.275192 |  I can tell you because she was on five live breakfast this morning
[41.84 - 47.40] P:1605.87 E:0.267067 |  She is eight year old Alicia Singh from Huddersfield who won a competition to carry out the match ball
[47.60 - 50.76] P:1583.49 E:0.278157 |  She said she wanted to meet Harry Kane more than anyone else
[51.24 - 56.16] P:1421.42 E:0.285675 |  They arrived here last thing last night. She's eight years old and she's here with her dad Ravi
[56.36 - 60.16] P:1354.10 E:0.282911 |  He'll be up in the stands and he said that he when he saw her walk out with the ball
[60.16 - 62.16] P:1601.43 E:0.234897 |  He said it would be in floods of tears
[62.36 - 64.36] P:1384.70 E:0.255482 |  So big day for her
[64.56 - 68.80] P:1269.45 E:0.245000 |  And obviously it's a World Cup match. It's a big day for England and Panama
[69.52 - 74.88] P:1296.49 E:0.238498 |  And here in the stadium in Nizhny Novgorod. We're ready for the Antons
[76.12 - 78.12] P:1618.13 E:0.372959 |  Wow some fantastic scenes here
[79.40 - 84.72] P:1644.19 E:0.330216 |  That's only the second time that the anthem of Panama has been played before a match of the World Cup finals
[85.44 - 87.24] P:1628.88 E:0.311446 |  And I'm not prone to this sort of thing
[87.24 - 94.40] P:1536.74 E:0.306394 |  But that almost brought tears to my eyes watching the way that the Panama players were singing the songs and also an andario Gomez
[94.44 - 97.84] P:1503.01 E:0.262621 |  Who's Colombian their coach so obviously not from Panama?
[98.08 - 104.54] P:1651.51 E:0.282669 |  He's standing watching his Panama players singing their anthem with a massive smile on his face
[104.96 - 109.56] P:1484.17 E:0.252124 |  Great to see and the supporters as well many of them in tears in the stands here
[109.92 - 117.52] P:1553.78 E:0.272328 |  So here we are in Nizhny Novgorod, that's a new venue for England never played here before never played Panama before in a senior
[117.64 - 124.88] P:1708.45 E:0.258564 |  International's the 38th different country that England have played at a World Cup so it's an historic event here a beautiful setting
[124.88 - 128.48] P:1564.80 E:0.232038 |  It's a glorious afternoon. I mean it's too hot for playing football
[128.72 - 131.96] P:1671.80 E:0.238310 |  But it's a beautiful summer's day in this
[132.72 - 139.40] P:1457.82 E:0.262222 |  Futuristic stadium. It looks wonderful angled white columns all the way around a sort of circular effect and above our heads in amongst all
[139.40 - 145.42] P:1562.68 E:0.237047 |  The white metal work we've got dark blue and light blue and white panels on the roof and the bright Russian
[145.80 - 149.32] P:1650.37 E:0.244285 |  Sunshine is shining through in this stadium
[149.32 - 155.40] P:1709.89 E:0.256707 |  Which is very close to the banks of the Volga River where it meets the Oka
[156.24 - 157.84] P:1865.36 E:0.238189 |  so
[157.84 - 166.04] P:1689.77 E:0.282429 |  Hurricane is shaking hands with the unmistakable captain of Panama Roman Torres the number five thirty two years old and having the
[166.16 - 168.72] P:1793.18 E:0.268823 |  Photographs taken with the Egyptian officials
[169.08 - 174.68] P:1707.63 E:0.271868 |  Gayad Grisha is the referee if you've missed it the team news England making just the one change
[175.00 - 178.68] P:1611.40 E:0.236777 |  And that is Loftus cheek in for the injured deli alley
[178.68 - 182.64] P:1597.48 E:0.256551 |  So England with Jordan Pickford Kyle Walker John Stones and Harry McGuire
[182.84 - 189.68] P:1575.68 E:0.256801 |  Kiran Trippier and Ashley Young of the wing backs Jordan Henderson with Jesse Lindgard and Ruben Loftus cheek out of sight and Raheem Sterling
[189.92 - 196.36] P:1494.47 E:0.257555 |  Playing behind Harry Kane and the Panama team unchanged from their first match Jaime Pinedo is their goalkeeper
[196.68 - 203.28] P:1543.96 E:0.279216 |  Michael Murillo Roman Torres Fidel Escobar and Eric Davis are the back for midfield of five with Gabriel Gomez in the middle
[203.28 - 211.56] P:1434.39 E:0.280325 |  Amanda Cooper and Annabelle Godoy either side of him with Edgar Barca and Jose Luis Rodriguez the white players and then the 37 year old
[212.32 - 216.68] P:1545.47 E:0.233729 |  blast Perez playing upfront for Panama
[217.68 - 219.68] P:1637.65 E:0.298399 |  43 goals in
[219.68 - 226.52] P:1453.08 E:0.272723 |  119 international appearances, but Panama have never beaten a European team in print 10 previous matches
[226.84 - 229.24] P:1475.62 E:0.290564 |  England they're on an 11 match and beaten run
[229.24 - 236.16] P:1519.15 E:0.274040 |  It's over a year since England last lost and they need to win this match to confirm their place in the last
[236.40 - 241.04] P:1674.88 E:0.266837 |  16 at this World Cup which they would do with one match to spare
[241.04 - 244.32] P:1687.58 E:0.277709 |  So that's the target Chris Waddle. Yep first 10 for me John
[244.32 - 248.60] P:1601.51 E:0.271107 |  Go and blast it go in the faces. These will not be used to playing any tempo or football
[248.60 - 256.36] P:1502.67 E:0.289300 |  We're other play whether it's in America whether it's in Panama, wherever it is Guatemala, Chile, Guatemala, Peru, Bulgaria, Romania, sorry
[256.64 - 259.68] P:1560.15 E:0.283605 |  Yes, wherever you want to name they're not used to playing high tempo
[259.68 - 263.20] P:1647.16 E:0.263857 |  So first 10 15 minutes of late this England do like they did against Sinigir
[263.44 - 267.28] P:1712.46 E:0.248312 |  Obviously will convert the Chastis and after that they can dictate the pace of the game
[267.28 - 273.72] P:1684.42 E:0.301586 |  So here we are Sunday afternoon the 24th of June. It is almost 3 p.m. Here in Nizhny Novgorod
[274.36 - 278.60] P:1644.54 E:0.304164 |  It's 1 p.m. Back in the UK. It's 7 a.m. back in Panama
[279.24 - 284.86] P:1753.09 E:0.284183 |  And the game begins they'll have got up early to watch this one. This is one they didn't want to miss
[285.92 - 290.22] P:1658.24 E:0.261054 |  England begin the match white shirts blue shorts white socks
[290.22 - 297.44] P:1570.64 E:0.266912 |  They're playing from right to left as we look high just to a right overlooking the halfway line and Panama are in there
[297.92 - 299.58] P:1578.50 E:0.248100 |  It's actually pillow box red
[299.58 - 304.82] P:1605.07 E:0.250086 |  I would say shirts shorts and socks with the white trim. This is the first team to play a box six
[305.78 - 311.42] P:1560.58 E:0.252263 |  So there you go. That may be the shape of things to come Gomez is so deep in there
[311.42 - 317.26] P:1491.54 E:0.259964 |  He is almost part of the back line. So England in possession on this swelteringly hot afternoon
[317.26 - 319.26] P:1458.33 E:0.255866 |  I don't have an exact temperature
[319.34 - 323.78] P:1612.44 E:0.272760 |  But the indication was that it would be something around 30 31 degrees Celsius
[323.78 - 329.10] P:1479.12 E:0.270437 |  But gala Southgate said yesterday and Danny Murphy backed it up actually it's easier if you're in possession
[329.58 - 334.30] P:1532.90 E:0.283348 |  And England coming down the right-hand side and England now could be in business here
[334.30 - 338.14] P:1583.77 E:0.298329 |  The ball is pulled across Lingard with a touch. It was a poor touch actually it bounced away from him
[338.54 - 341.30] P:1433.31 E:0.305190 |  Henderson tries to win it back for England on the edge of the penalty area
[341.30 - 344.78] P:1500.62 E:0.275978 |  It bounces down is whacked away and there's a foul given Panama's way
[346.42 - 348.42] P:1571.78 E:0.204584 |  And actually it's
[348.42 - 350.90] P:1297.99 E:0.290307 |  There's an England man down. Is it Jesse Lingard?
[352.50 - 354.50] P:1391.75 E:0.276826 |  Yes, I think it is
[354.74 - 358.94] P:1396.31 E:0.279109 |  He's taken a bang in the midst of all of that Jordan Henderson was in there
[359.58 - 365.86] P:1337.52 E:0.267157 |  He was caught Jesse Lingard by an elbow and we you know, we know very well about the
[366.38 - 370.70] P:1440.04 E:0.285188 |  Robust nature of this Panama team five bookings in the first match
[371.06 - 373.06] P:1495.49 E:0.251140 |  Gabrielle Gomez jumped for that
[373.06 - 379.50] P:1501.75 E:0.273027 |  I'm using his arms trying to try to use them as levers and he caught Lingard on the side of the jaw
[379.50 - 385.22] P:1534.94 E:0.254001 |  I don't think you meant that. I don't think he saw Lingard with a brave start by inlock just to get no don't have rights
[386.30 - 388.30] P:1520.95 E:0.270947 |  trying to pull it back, but
[388.90 - 394.54] P:1484.06 E:0.273067 |  The key is the tempo, but I know it's hot. We keep talking about how hot it is and uncomfortable to play in but
[395.18 - 397.86] P:1557.87 E:0.259376 |  England's just got to get that first goal as early as possible for me
[397.86 - 403.18] P:1588.19 E:0.249583 |  And then then total control the game because we've saw already Panama setting up with a back six at times
[403.54 - 409.68] P:1686.22 E:0.257289 |  And it's done his limitations for them. They're making sure that Jesse Lingard is okay. He's up. He's on his knees and
[410.54 - 413.62] P:1662.12 E:0.290199 |  He's been spoken to because obviously there is the concussion issue
[413.66 - 418.26] P:1633.13 E:0.276126 |  You've spoken about at this World Cup in relation to Amrabat of Morocco
[418.26 - 425.30] P:1685.47 E:0.267057 |  And so they're going through the procedure here to check that everything is okay with Jesse Lingard and that there is no
[425.30 - 430.58] P:1682.73 E:0.253244 |  There are five checks and clearly the England medical people are going through those checks with Jesse Lingard
[430.58 - 436.38] P:1585.64 E:0.262194 |  So we'll just have to wait to see that they are satisfied that there is no concussion issue here the referee
[438.30 - 441.06] P:1608.80 E:0.256954 |  Gihad Grisha is just
[441.90 - 443.90] P:1381.54 E:0.252850 |  Keeping an eye on this and then
[444.14 - 448.90] P:1543.25 E:0.284149 |  Jesse Lingard is being led off to the far side of the field and I think we can take it from that that he's going to be okay to
[448.90 - 454.30] P:1650.36 E:0.294436 |  Continue so with that lengthy stoppage. We've already played almost three minutes here BBC radio five live
[454.30 - 457.42] P:1566.10 E:0.286313 |  This is the World Cup on the BBC on that five live
[457.42 - 459.38] P:1587.09 E:0.303130 |  You can listen via the BBC sport app
[459.38 - 465.02] P:1587.23 E:0.292080 |  But also it's a BBC television game this afternoon Guy Mowbray and Danny Murphy are just sitting to our left here
[465.02 - 467.98] P:1638.90 E:0.297927 |  So you can watch it if you're on your way home on BBC one
[467.98 - 473.26] P:1673.08 E:0.286791 |  And if you like you can listen to our you can continue listening to our five live commentary via the red button
[473.26 - 477.22] P:1816.55 E:0.273606 |  Panama making their first attack down the left hand side free kick Jose
[477.74 - 480.42] P:1580.20 E:0.306119 |  Luis Rodriguez is fouled and it's a free kick out on the left
[480.42 - 485.74] P:1641.20 E:0.287800 |  Well, I just think it's a long clearance by the keeper couple head has worn trippier gives a silly foul push away
[485.74 - 487.34] P:1790.17 E:0.250346 |  Don't get involved in that
[487.34 - 490.02] P:1765.58 E:0.303556 |  Play your football. You don't want to go down. We know that physical
[490.02 - 493.82] P:1782.25 E:0.265125 |  We know they like to stop the game and foul don't go don't go that play your football
[494.38 - 497.10] P:1760.48 E:0.257434 |  Free kick which is going to be swung in left-footed
[498.02 - 501.22] P:1673.57 E:0.250327 |  By the left back Eric Davis Eric with a C
[501.46 - 505.98] P:1507.63 E:0.275867 |  Here it is the delivery with the left foot headed away by the England captain Harry Kane near the penalty spot
[505.98 - 509.98] P:1667.24 E:0.269934 |  It comes out and an effort from distance from 40 yards plus
[510.74 - 514.70] P:1708.69 E:0.260050 |  He teeded up Edgar Barsenas went for the volley went for glory
[514.90 - 518.18] P:1602.74 E:0.249267 |  My goodness if he'd scored from there that would have been Panamanian glory
[518.18 - 521.42] P:1182.11 E:0.263332 |  But it was high over the top of the crossbar. It was a long way away from the goal
[521.42 - 524.26] P:1478.99 E:0.289386 |  That was a very ambitious, but there you go look back in their own half
[524.74 - 526.74] P:1545.19 E:0.218186 |  This city is a six nearly and
[527.38 - 530.06] P:1526.97 E:0.246892 |  Three in front of them one up front on his own and the counter attack
[530.06 - 536.02] P:1732.27 E:0.320757 |  Oh passion Lingard back on the field short to Ashley young and that means that Panamaro a on a dangerous attack
[536.02 - 541.64] P:1730.95 E:0.334909 |  Here is Barsenas who plays it square and it's blazed over the top by Annabelle Godoy in the area
[542.62 - 544.30] P:1773.42 E:0.293037 |  16 yards out
[544.30 - 550.58] P:1661.88 E:0.289352 |  He saw the England goal open up in front of him and with his left foot. He sliced it horribly wide
[550.58 - 554.86] P:1660.97 E:0.248764 |  Oh what a chance you knock it about a chance on his left foot. He comes to save for it
[554.86 - 558.54] P:1631.50 E:0.267069 |  He's just a scapegoat you think he's done everything right. He's not gonna blast it
[558.54 - 561.30] P:1594.73 E:0.254900 |  He's gonna place it from the edge of the box high and wide again
[562.38 - 563.86] P:1810.22 E:0.206820 |  Kailas from England
[563.86 - 567.38] P:1668.28 E:0.250685 |  Yeah, they've got a watch for that. They're gonna have a lot of football at the back in the midfield
[567.38 - 570.30] P:1678.29 E:0.261735 |  Don't get sloppy in the at the minute. I think the plane a little bit too slow
[570.98 - 575.66] P:1650.73 E:0.225339 |  England nil Panama nil England with that loftest cheek
[575.66 - 580.44] P:1695.09 E:0.232037 |  But the ball runs under his feet and it runs back to Davis and now
[580.98 - 583.62] P:1717.65 E:0.293904 |  Godoy who just missed that chance gives it back to
[584.30 - 591.28] P:1696.24 E:0.280437 |  Rodriguez on the left wing Rodriguez works it in field and he's court laid there Rodriguez the ball had gone and
[592.26 - 598.38] P:1756.61 E:0.254519 |  It's a free kick the Panama and loftest cheek just gets a word no more than that after committing that foul
[598.90 - 603.94] P:1664.25 E:0.253177 |  Just a little show just late a little trip, but nothing major. What's England just having self
[603.94 - 605.94] P:1639.41 E:0.247877 |  They kind of sell it the minute give
[606.34 - 610.34] P:1716.90 E:0.294770 |  You've got to give their Panama credit that started very bright. I've got a good shape with them
[610.34 - 611.30] P:1535.13 E:0.177937 |  Well
[611.30 - 615.38] P:1547.12 E:0.277949 |  Country-tucking football at the minute, but England got the settle down move the ball quicker
[616.02 - 619.62] P:1713.15 E:0.256940 |  That's what they did in the early stages against Chinna's here
[619.62 - 624.30] P:1614.56 E:0.262918 |  But it's not been the case just yet free kick taken and it's hoisted right across the penalty area
[624.30 - 626.30] P:1620.54 E:0.216138 |  But Pickford's going to allow that to bounce
[626.46 - 630.18] P:1518.52 E:0.285232 |  Into the shadows there is a circle because it's a circular roof here
[630.18 - 635.14] P:1566.70 E:0.259322 |  So we have a circle of sunshine which is currently on the far side of the field around about
[635.14 - 640.22] P:1518.71 E:0.249654 |  What probably a quarter of the playing surface at the moment and most of the stand on the far side
[640.22 - 645.68] P:1539.70 E:0.244734 |  They must be baking in there on the opposite side. It's a day when everyone needs to drink water here and
[646.54 - 650.10] P:1577.50 E:0.253735 |  England bringing the ball forward from the back with Kyle Walker
[650.10 - 653.22] P:1609.09 E:0.245709 |  He is the only England player who's on a yellow card after the
[653.90 - 656.82] P:1586.89 E:0.262657 |  opening group matches five of the Panama team are
[657.30 - 659.46] P:1716.77 E:0.294852 |  My Harry McGuire now England just keeping it
[659.46 - 665.28] P:1798.92 E:0.274689 |  But again without that pace that Chris is talking about but I think just get the feeling here that the message from Garos
[665.28 - 668.86] P:1701.84 E:0.278718 |  Southgate has been to keep possession and make Panama work
[668.86 - 672.34] P:1646.01 E:0.251211 |  But as a result they're not moving it as quickly as they did against
[672.82 - 673.66] P:1443.51 E:0.306154 |  Tunisia however
[673.66 - 679.08] P:1620.27 E:0.284977 |  There's a long ball over the top from that walk out towards trivia who takes it on but the challenge comes in and it bounces
[679.90 - 686.02] P:1686.83 E:0.269802 |  Behind off Davis for the first corner. Good run by Tripp. He has watched it great run great time and great ball in
[687.70 - 691.98] P:1681.39 E:0.269164 |  Whole trip they're often give a down south the gold kick that he fed up, but it's gone out of the corner
[691.98 - 694.98] P:1727.79 E:0.277592 |  We know already we've seen the tournament out strong England odd set pieces
[695.54 - 703.38] P:1591.00 E:0.275122 |  Someone waves the flag of China up the set of gray steps behind where Kearn and Tripp here is going to take this corner for England
[703.70 - 710.74] P:1571.39 E:0.264173 |  Scored with a corner right at the end of the game against Tunisia and let's see if Harry Kane is going to be allowed
[711.94 - 713.94] P:1672.52 E:0.267679 |  And the referee is actually called across
[714.26 - 718.14] P:1471.52 E:0.300035 |  Everybody still do it look he's doing it. He's just told him to stop and look he goes and does it
[718.14 - 723.34] P:1496.86 E:0.272091 |  I repeat it again Harry Kane standing a couple of yards inside the area God I has actually put his arms around
[723.74 - 730.90] P:1701.59 E:0.274335 |  He's not holding and actually Harry McGuire has just been pulled over by Gabriel Dolmets. Do you want to dance?
[730.94 - 732.62] P:1855.67 E:0.203498 |  It was
[732.62 - 737.98] P:1587.40 E:0.232246 |  Do you want to waltz it's a waltz isn't it? Yeah, well is it it could be Latin American. Oh good one
[738.62 - 740.62] P:1605.92 E:0.263705 |  I'm trying it
[744.06 - 750.30] P:1727.85 E:0.306213 |  Tripp yet with the corner from the right. No Kings, but McGuire has been pulled over and the balls had it into the net
[750.70 - 756.38] P:1874.58 E:0.325739 |  John Stones is there totally unmarked. He's sneaked in 11 yards out
[756.50 - 761.14] P:1828.14 E:0.313563 |  He just placed a header into the back of the net. It's his first goal for England
[761.18 - 766.94] P:1757.45 E:0.291545 |  He scored it here at the World Cup in Russia and England in front with eight minutes on the clock
[767.18 - 772.38] P:1678.81 E:0.279533 |  One nail over Panamap. Well, I've got to say though. I'd say at Leemard the referee pulled them up twice
[772.90 - 776.66] P:1680.06 E:0.284028 |  All the storming another second game England look really strong at set pieces
[777.10 - 781.46] P:1696.43 E:0.283666 |  They're all running around each other don't know who's picking stones if he gets away to great header
[782.02 - 788.26] P:1651.97 E:0.282295 |  Goalkeeper's right. No chance bottom corner really good header and as I said England look really threatening from set pieces
[790.10 - 791.82] P:1510.26 E:0.240159 |  Tripp here's corner
[791.82 - 794.06] P:1549.54 E:0.248663 |  Stones with the header and frankly
[794.82 - 796.82] P:1518.37 E:0.258382 |  They don't get much easier than that
[797.82 - 801.58] P:1563.63 E:0.270854 |  Stone I don't think stones had anyone within three or four yards of him and
[802.38 - 805.86] P:1497.27 E:0.286297 |  I mean England players were being hauled over in all
[806.30 - 812.78] P:1543.82 E:0.271097 |  Parts of the penalty area and actually just seeing the replay of garrus Southgate who begins by appealing for a penalty and ends up
[813.14 - 818.90] P:1650.06 E:0.259985 |  Celebrating the very straightforward goal that John Stones has scored for England to make it one now
[819.86 - 823.46] P:1531.32 E:0.273142 |  Exactly what they needed an early call now they can control the game
[824.46 - 827.54] P:1514.77 E:0.257207 |  You know, they're not chasing it and I'm gonna be nervous about it
[827.54 - 831.98] P:1498.13 E:0.251539 |  They're in control now. They've just got to keep the tempo open next five ten minutes, but look after the ball
[833.54 - 835.54] P:1452.84 E:0.264019 |  The good win from here for Panama
[838.38 - 846.66] P:1495.56 E:0.250255 |  They're in possession with Murillo who wins the throwing I think he was an Oleg John Stones goal Murillo the right back. Yeah
[847.66 - 853.38] P:1596.64 E:0.259125 |  Well England as Panama take the throw in and lose possession immediately Henderson now
[853.38 - 857.90] P:1629.19 E:0.283680 |  Lin guard who fortunately seems to have shaken off that no when he's chopped down by Cooper
[857.90 - 860.94] P:1493.55 E:0.262335 |  I was terrible. On the halfway line. That was a poor tackle that
[861.54 - 867.50] P:1479.14 E:0.247713 |  Yellow card quite rightly so I deserve that. That's just reckless and there's no need for it
[867.50 - 869.50] P:1463.51 E:0.271832 |  So and that's him out of the Belgian game
[869.90 - 872.26] P:1471.93 E:0.289853 |  Out of the Tunisia game so late. It's
[873.42 - 875.74] P:1331.48 E:0.286570 |  That's his second yellow card of the tournament. So
[876.66 - 878.66] P:1408.55 E:0.251951 |  Winning his 99th cap
[879.02 - 883.10] P:1225.77 E:0.278195 |  Armando Cooper will not win his 100 here at the World Cup
[884.54 - 890.42] P:1366.34 E:0.271094 |  You could I mean that's almost brainless, isn't it so early in the game as well now and
[892.38 - 893.74] P:1343.01 E:0.265068 |  Discipline
[893.74 - 898.62] P:1373.63 E:0.279532 |  England one Panama nil BBC five live first of our three commentaries today
[898.74 - 902.18] P:1387.91 E:0.239266 |  The next two are the second set of matches in group H
[902.18 - 909.06] P:1342.31 E:0.243742 |  And that is the group that the two teams from the England Belgium group group G will play in the last 16
[909.06 - 910.82] P:1362.06 E:0.268458 |  So first of all four o'clock PST
[910.82 - 916.54] P:1414.77 E:0.248614 |  We have Japan against Senegal and then at seven o'clock this evening PST Poland against Columbia
[916.54 - 918.54] P:1481.02 E:0.269725 |  Which comes alive from inside the stadium in Kazan
[919.18 - 925.30] P:1490.76 E:0.269732 |  Here is Harry Maguire winning the ball on the halfway line and it's out of play for a throw that Murillo takes down the right hand side
[925.30 - 930.70] P:1634.32 E:0.294216 |  Barca knows is after this Barca knows pulls a low ball across its moment just cleared by Walker. I thought he'd missed it
[931.18 - 933.18] P:1433.59 E:0.246645 |  That will come from money McGuire
[933.62 - 938.30] P:1687.03 E:0.282628 |  Tana boy, which was never on given away by Walker and now a chance here for
[938.54 - 944.90] P:1657.89 E:0.293534 |  Rodriguez into the penalty area chips it across and he's chipped it over both of his teammates inside the penalty area
[945.26 - 950.70] P:1459.41 E:0.251195 |  Drifted over bar centers being some shaking moments for England defensively moments
[950.70 - 955.10] P:1503.32 E:0.273502 |  Yeah, and Harry McGuire said it gives a ball around the halfway lane. They got a throw in they took it quick and
[955.46 - 957.46] P:1436.87 E:0.276225 |  Hell Walker just as well. He was there
[958.46 - 962.30] P:1398.76 E:0.220311 |  Had a forward for Panama by Roman Torres
[962.42 - 969.54] P:1494.90 E:0.245064 |  He's winning his 110th cap this evening Henderson plays it forward the ball though was out of play over the touch line
[970.02 - 972.02] P:1415.71 E:0.215344 |  next to the England dugout
[972.10 - 974.10] P:1339.16 E:0.231641 |  before he did so so
[974.34 - 982.10] P:1418.95 E:0.263930 |  It's offside against Sterling Garas Southgate just appeared he is wearing the waistcoat again. No jacket, but a waistcoat a
[982.54 - 984.30] P:1394.01 E:0.256837 |  waistcoat
[985.18 - 987.18] P:1526.82 E:0.210747 |  That's what it is you think
[987.34 - 992.46] P:1627.15 E:0.242443 |  Forward from Torres flick header on by blast Perez, but it comes down and England have got the ball at the back
[992.46 - 997.14] P:1458.09 E:0.237653 |  So you just joined us England this match kicked off almost 12 minutes ago
[997.14 - 1003.46] P:1536.42 E:0.230266 |  And they're already in front through John Stones first goal for England as he wins here his 28th cap
[1003.86 - 1008.62] P:1458.68 E:0.238429 |  And it was a simple header in from 11 or 12 yards out from a corner from trivia
[1008.62 - 1014.26] P:1593.85 E:0.261117 |  England score another goal from from a corner Henderson long and forward out towards lofters cheek
[1014.26 - 1019.86] P:1575.64 E:0.279293 |  Who pulls away and tried to pull the ball out of the sky and I suspect they're actually miscontrolled it behind for a goal kick
[1019.86 - 1025.14] P:1452.70 E:0.244453 |  I suspect he might have been looking straight at the Sun when he looked into the heavens. That's what he'll say as well
[1026.82 - 1030.46] P:1632.73 E:0.270689 |  Okay, what we're just in a replay great clearance because I was a certain tapping
[1031.26 - 1037.06] P:1522.20 E:0.268918 |  But give Panama a bit of credit. They actually look very dangerous on the counter attack England for all the one they love haven't settled yet
[1037.66 - 1039.66] P:1477.99 E:0.220740 |  One nil England
[1041.46 - 1044.06] P:1506.53 E:0.242082 |  Had a one on the far side the
[1044.94 - 1050.70] P:1547.07 E:0.242352 |  Panama left by Perez who's pulled out towards the left flank so much experience in this Panama side
[1050.70 - 1058.22] P:1594.33 E:0.243065 |  But the Ferrari never experienced anything quite like this or at least before they came to the World Cup already beaten 3-0 by Belgium
[1058.82 - 1066.90] P:1672.17 E:0.254844 |  And now Panama taking on England currently ranked number 12 in the world Panama down in 55th in the FIFA World Rankets
[1067.06 - 1072.78] P:1457.71 E:0.273139 |  Panama in possession in the sunshine on the far side of the field on the Volga River side of the stadium
[1073.02 - 1079.42] P:1514.31 E:0.267084 |  Back who comes back to Fidel Escobar who was going to hit a long pass straight into the path of Henderson giving it away
[1079.42 - 1084.10] P:1734.90 E:0.282787 |  And Henderson's first time pass through the middle for Harry Kane who can't latch on to it and goalkeeper
[1084.10 - 1087.62] P:1597.00 E:0.272623 |  Pineda was able to come out and pick up anything right Henderson didn't he maybe it's the
[1087.98 - 1092.36] P:1612.66 E:0.271088 |  Heavily war at the pitch maybe it just slipped on and went away from Harry Kane
[1092.48 - 1095.76] P:1556.32 E:0.303991 |  Kane's won it back from Torres that was careless by Roman Torres
[1095.96 - 1102.08] P:1487.34 E:0.268298 |  But then Kane is challenged and beaten by Maria who wins the ball back from the England captain and eventually it's deflected out of play
[1102.48 - 1106.04] P:1277.76 E:0.277119 |  Offaling guard for a throw into Panama half to inside their own half good chance
[1106.04 - 1109.74] P:1371.52 E:0.276008 |  John Chris, I'm gonna stick my neck out and say I think there might be more goals in this one
[1111.44 - 1113.44] P:1441.09 E:0.286724 |  I wouldn't say we're sticking a neck out
[1114.20 - 1116.20] P:1529.26 E:0.259659 |  My turn was in my cheek
[1116.20 - 1118.20] P:1520.72 E:0.270887 |  Oh
[1118.40 - 1120.40] P:1640.53 E:0.252120 |  Nintendo
[1121.64 - 1123.64] P:1379.68 E:0.293647 |  There could be more goals at bull things
[1125.28 - 1129.40] P:1414.72 E:0.266632 |  Quarter an hour played very nearly and it's England one Panama nil
[1129.96 - 1134.48] P:1549.91 E:0.255599 |  Pineda takes the free kick downfield for Panama's headed away comes out for
[1135.00 - 1139.48] P:1697.50 E:0.264692 |  Sterling who's not yet been able to get into the game really and he's picked up here for a foul
[1140.20 - 1146.56] P:1705.34 E:0.242958 |  On Eric Davis so free kick to Panama a few yards inside the England half
[1147.24 - 1149.64] P:1571.91 E:0.289140 |  It looks as though the stadium here is almost full
[1151.00 - 1153.00] P:1559.30 E:0.218538 |  45,000 capacity
[1153.32 - 1160.20] P:1564.35 E:0.275844 |  Torres now Roman Torres swings the ball out towards the left-hand side towards Davis and Davis will take it on just a little ball in
[1160.20 - 1164.96] P:1626.12 E:0.277548 |  Field towards Godoy and now Davis again up it goes towards Jose Luis Rodriguez
[1165.00 - 1170.00] P:1628.58 E:0.268954 |  And now Panama keeping possession but being forced by Henderson back towards the center circle
[1170.00 - 1176.76] P:1577.60 E:0.251100 |  So the ball is moved out to the right-hand side for Panama as they play from left to right and now Armando Cooper
[1177.68 - 1180.48] P:1636.94 E:0.245965 |  Cooper with a ball to Godoy
[1181.20 - 1183.88] P:1684.26 E:0.261085 |  Mario again, this is good possession from
[1184.40 - 1190.60] P:1670.38 E:0.280506 |  From Panama England just standing off them and Mario does well to go around Ashley young and Mario takes it on and plays it
[1190.60 - 1193.16] P:1763.27 E:0.295414 |  into a central position a curling shot from
[1193.80 - 1198.76] P:1678.89 E:0.303692 |  The central area from Barcelona's on his left foot that was only a yard wide
[1199.76 - 1203.00] P:1900.13 E:0.250155 |  I've got to say clean clean walk 15 minutes and
[1204.16 - 1209.36] P:1764.79 E:0.293111 |  They look the better side overall. I mean England about score from a set-piece, but in general play
[1210.32 - 1216.40] P:1774.71 E:0.272425 |  They've got down the flanks on three or four occasions and that was a great effort left foot what 25 yards bent
[1216.40 - 1219.92] P:1672.48 E:0.265668 |  I don't think pick they would have gotten here it looked me enough it went outside the post
[1220.48 - 1227.04] P:1607.58 E:0.241525 |  Were it not for John Stones headed goal for England this would have been a concerning start yet for England
[1228.92 - 1235.12] P:1560.67 E:0.254701 |  England bringing it out from the back stones passes it forward it finds its way to Lingard strong challenge comes in on Lingard
[1235.12 - 1239.36] P:1610.01 E:0.277911 |  But he managed to evade it and then sterling deflects the ball into Torres is mid-riff. He's gone down
[1240.56 - 1244.36] P:1668.23 E:0.269715 |  In some pain actually in a stayed down and England win the ball back
[1245.08 - 1250.36] P:1514.21 E:0.248366 |  Henderson gives it to young and I think the referee wants to stop playing out to see how Torres is
[1250.96 - 1253.68] P:1517.51 E:0.249105 |  It's funny that isn't it? Well see I think I'm sure you'd be all right
[1254.88 - 1259.16] P:1441.27 E:0.265721 |  When Panama had the ball it didn't put the ball out as soon as England would have offered me say put it out
[1259.44 - 1261.44] P:1540.64 E:0.225764 |  You know of order so I
[1262.12 - 1264.40] P:1726.87 E:0.290953 |  Don't think there's anything wrong just so replay
[1266.32 - 1273.32] P:1668.16 E:0.268630 |  There's no contact I think he's kicked the football. Yeah, did he just he just catches ankle is ankle ball. I'm not sure
[1274.08 - 1279.00] P:1503.87 E:0.268451 |  Anyway, he's he's down and England are taking the opportunity the England players to come across and
[1279.84 - 1285.12] P:1604.48 E:0.265733 |  And and have a drink here the water bottles are being provided for three four five six seven
[1286.04 - 1288.04] P:1771.98 E:0.180153 |  England players
[1288.04 - 1290.64] P:1563.07 E:0.290105 |  Jordan Henderson now carries one over towards Harry McGuire
[1290.64 - 1296.16] P:1667.02 E:0.250474 |  He's going to take one as well to to stones and walk up and England have just got to have a think here
[1296.16 - 1297.68] P:1499.53 E:0.296577 |  Go to Southgate speaking to one or two
[1297.68 - 1300.92] P:1704.18 E:0.263654 |  He's got up the tempo is very congested in that middle of the park
[1301.12 - 1305.88] P:1673.75 E:0.256044 |  They're using the wing backs overseas the width, but maybe people like stealing can they get sort of that?
[1306.48 - 1308.24] P:1680.77 E:0.262013 |  Go and stand away for ten minutes
[1308.24 - 1311.60] P:1739.17 E:0.274162 |  Just see what they do the opposition because he's basically playing as a second straight out
[1311.60 - 1313.80] P:1641.97 E:0.238978 |  He's got there's enough bodies around but
[1314.76 - 1317.04] P:1707.69 E:0.278945 |  It's just frustrating they get never really in the ball
[1317.04 - 1322.80] P:1654.72 E:0.276607 |  But the Indian art moving the ball quick enough so they're causing our own problems England are leading Panama though by one goal to
[1322.80 - 1327.80] P:1656.15 E:0.256016 |  Now they're stiflingly hot afternoon on what seems to be quite a dry pitch
[1328.52 - 1331.76] P:1701.49 E:0.289964 |  By the way in the final one-day international in the series
[1332.44 - 1336.16] P:1557.22 E:0.260055 |  Australia eight wickets down now last we heard they were
[1336.56 - 1338.96] P:1523.60 E:0.262713 |  181 for eight we'll get an update for you on that
[1339.04 - 1344.68] P:1490.25 E:0.248079 |  But you can hear the ball by ball commentary or on five live sports extra with Jonathan Agnew and the team Jimmy Anderson
[1344.68 - 1346.96] P:1268.44 E:0.247284 |  It's part of the team Adam Gilchrist as well
[1347.48 - 1350.56] P:1379.25 E:0.254344 |  That's on your digital radio or via BBC
[1351.44 - 1355.12] P:1301.82 E:0.276723 |  iPlayer radio Lingards suggesting there that he's been pulled over off the ball
[1356.12 - 1358.24] P:1456.22 E:0.273203 |  Looks towards the referee England are in possession
[1358.76 - 1363.12] P:1271.09 E:0.232894 |  Torres is back on the field for Panama with his main of dreadlocks
[1363.12 - 1367.12] P:1414.96 E:0.262790 |  He's he could be the strongest looking outfield player at this world cup
[1367.12 - 1373.56] P:1312.97 E:0.230771 |  He has thighs that are the size of tree trunks the ball with England on the halfway line
[1374.24 - 1375.52] P:1335.84 E:0.163000 |  Maguire
[1375.52 - 1378.56] P:1289.32 E:0.222152 |  ten yards inside Panama territory and then
[1378.88 - 1384.96] P:1516.22 E:0.256977 |  Maguire turns after receiving the ball back from young gives it to the goal scorer stones to his right walker tries
[1385.16 - 1390.44] P:1437.84 E:0.261605 |  To head a long pass towards trip here, but he's overhead that and it drifts out of play for a three into Panama
[1390.44 - 1394.76] P:1362.54 E:0.279076 |  No, it's it's rather disjointed from England still Chris with nearly 20 minutes play
[1394.76 - 1399.40] P:1336.24 E:0.255823 |  They're gonna get more joy on the flanks. They are down in the middle eight packed the middle of three in the back
[1399.40 - 1403.52] P:1485.58 E:0.256016 |  The two full backs are quite narrow you need width and obviously they're getting it from the wing backs
[1403.52 - 1405.96] P:1626.84 E:0.262846 |  But I'm still is not getting any joy now
[1405.96 - 1410.28] P:1619.06 E:0.255464 |  It's up to him to find some space and it may just be standing wait for ten minutes gives him that joy
[1410.28 - 1414.36] P:1632.37 E:0.208280 |  Yeah, but at the moment he is central just behind Harry Kane
[1415.36 - 1419.48] P:1531.86 E:0.241961 |  In the England front line, but the ball was with the back line at the moment Walker
[1420.24 - 1421.20] P:1678.19 E:0.193777 |  Walker
[1421.20 - 1427.40] P:1710.08 E:0.255991 |  Rolls it up towards Kane who drops deep then a touch from Ruben Loftus cheek who started mainly on the right side
[1427.44 - 1432.52] P:1641.81 E:0.300043 |  Incidentally Loftus cheek, but then trivia with a ball into Lingard inside the penalty area two defenders come across
[1432.84 - 1439.04] P:1776.47 E:0.298862 |  Down goes Lingard. He was sandwiched. It's a penalty. It's a penalty to England Torres came came across
[1439.28 - 1444.68] P:1713.10 E:0.258992 |  The other central defender Escobar was there as well. They caught Lingard between them. It's a penalty
[1444.96 - 1449.48] P:1735.59 E:0.240912 |  Well, Lingard is brilliant at making runs in behind we saw in the first game
[1450.56 - 1454.84] P:1696.08 E:0.262400 |  There's two of us Tabata around him. He's gone to ground in and the referees give it
[1454.84 - 1459.38] P:1666.82 E:0.251361 |  I don't have they're gonna use bar, but it's pushing and shoving and they'll think they've been hardly done by
[1459.38 - 1462.84] P:1558.28 E:0.250535 |  He's gone down quite easily to be honest, but it makes a great run in behind. That's what he's good at
[1463.04 - 1468.18] P:1609.73 E:0.238881 |  Well, they're checking VAI is actually checking for possible offside leading up to the penalty
[1468.36 - 1471.76] P:1584.11 E:0.243924 |  See, I don't think that that as a penalty would be overturned
[1471.76 - 1478.72] P:1600.11 E:0.243964 |  I think they'd go with the referees call on that as a penalty, but it depends whether there was an offside in the build-up
[1478.72 - 1480.72] P:1716.62 E:0.207260 |  So we're waiting here
[1481.00 - 1483.84] P:1648.20 E:0.261365 |  For that to be checked. We're not seeing the pictures right now
[1483.84 - 1487.20] P:1690.98 E:0.255292 |  We've got the pictures it was trippiest ball to Lingard
[1487.20 - 1492.52] P:1558.55 E:0.253833 |  I think Lingard was was onside there as he took it into the box into the six yard box when he was fouled
[1493.36 - 1495.52] P:1587.88 E:0.260379 |  Let's see what the referee is going to do here
[1496.20 - 1502.28] P:1622.19 E:0.237752 |  Yep, the penalty I think has been given we've not seen it on the screen yet
[1502.40 - 1504.04] P:1659.23 E:0.238816 |  It's not been confirmed on the screen
[1504.04 - 1510.00] P:1587.55 E:0.271811 |  But but he the Panama players are being sent away Torres is walking towards the Egyptian referee with his palms apart
[1510.28 - 1513.64] P:1748.62 E:0.273446 |  But but he's telling them they need to leave the penalty area
[1514.04 - 1519.16] P:1751.08 E:0.265563 |  The Panama players and Harry Kane now has yep the check is over that's confirmed
[1519.32 - 1524.64] P:1709.54 E:0.265407 |  So Harry Kane now has a chance to put England into a 2-0 lead from the penalty spot
[1524.76 - 1526.76] P:1806.20 E:0.285227 |  Actually one of the Panama players the
[1527.28 - 1532.48] P:1744.82 E:0.267028 |  The highly experienced Gabriel Gomez is now going across and talking to Harry Kane
[1532.88 - 1535.24] P:1737.89 E:0.250419 |  He just looks over his shoulder at him
[1535.80 - 1542.56] P:1700.89 E:0.259489 |  As if he was one of those flies from Volgograd and it knows him and now there's there's some pushing and showing
[1542.56 - 1545.48] P:1539.16 E:0.266184 |  What's the goal he doing on the edge of the area the goalkeeper's standing
[1545.76 - 1550.88] P:1467.12 E:0.273047 |  Leaning against the post a little like the way that Neville Southall used to I don't think you save it from there
[1550.88 - 1554.26] P:1577.84 E:0.264916 |  Well, I wouldn't have thought so I would describe that as an open invitation
[1555.00 - 1558.46] P:1578.31 E:0.276156 |  Canes putting the ball on the spot. It's all calmed down on the edge of the area
[1558.92 - 1565.30] P:1500.41 E:0.251619 |  Kane is ready to take it the goalkeeper Pineda is still leaning against the post
[1566.12 - 1569.28] P:1736.71 E:0.248274 |  And now finally he walks over
[1570.24 - 1574.00] P:1796.26 E:0.273006 |  And it's ready to face the penalty for from Harry Kane
[1574.52 - 1579.64] P:1868.07 E:0.311882 |  Harry Kane from the spot drives it high into the net and it's 2-0 to England and
[1580.00 - 1582.48] P:1809.56 E:0.322398 |  Harry Kane yet again scores
[1583.92 - 1586.28] P:1725.20 E:0.306794 |  Having started as captain of England
[1587.04 - 1593.44] P:1712.12 E:0.280559 |  2-0 against Panama. Well, you don't say them do you April so much power to that top corner goal is right
[1594.32 - 1597.16] P:1753.83 E:0.262274 |  Absolutely no chance well struck excellent then
[1600.64 - 1605.64] P:1673.85 E:0.277955 |  That was hit with some force and actually just seeing at the replay from the camera and
[1606.00 - 1612.28] P:1544.15 E:0.267433 |  And came hit it right towards the camera and it was past the the goalkeeper Pineda before he could play
[1612.28 - 1615.56] P:1603.66 E:0.246435 |  He'd have to split in slow slow motion now. It was it that hard
[1616.56 - 1617.92] P:1283.47 E:0.249023 |  and
[1617.92 - 1625.08] P:1566.72 E:0.268220 |  It is 2-0 to England here and Harry Kane that makes it three goals for Kane here at this World Cup
[1625.68 - 1631.84] P:1598.48 E:0.251047 |  He scored nine goals in the seven matches in which he has captained England
[1632.04 - 1635.22] P:1378.96 E:0.288700 |  That is 11 in his last nine England appearances
[1635.40 - 1641.10] P:1632.67 E:0.246019 |  It means that he scored in five consecutive England matches now and just for one more
[1641.10 - 1644.24] P:1769.22 E:0.232646 |  It is a total of 16 in 26 appearances
[1645.20 - 1650.92] P:1584.79 E:0.252501 |  For Harry Kane in an England shirt. This cheek even loft is cheek has just fouled
[1652.28 - 1658.58] P:1452.27 E:0.261554 |  Rodriguez and a yellow card for loft is cheek who has not particularly settled on his first
[1659.30 - 1665.50] P:1433.69 E:0.261851 |  Cup of three kicks away now was his last chance to referee's book them the news from back home at Old Trafford
[1666.22 - 1670.00] P:1499.45 E:0.274812 |  Australia 205 all out actually in just 34.4 overs
[1670.22 - 1677.30] P:1484.36 E:0.246001 |  So England obviously will need 206 to win in their 50 in order to make it a 5-0 series white wash
[1677.30 - 1679.82] P:1366.19 E:0.257719 |  You can hear that over on five life sports extra right now
[1680.02 - 1686.46] P:1489.48 E:0.221220 |  But Harry Kane scoring from the penalty spot to make it 2-0 and England despite
[1687.14 - 1692.38] P:1306.71 E:0.248303 |  The way that they've played which hasn't been terribly impressive how in total control now not total control. I think
[1693.74 - 1696.62] P:1428.10 E:0.270270 |  Panama had a few half chances when the current attack, but
[1697.22 - 1701.84] P:1418.43 E:0.250644 |  They can't defend they've give to a certain set piece and then a silly penalty giveaway
[1701.84 - 1704.26] P:1514.29 E:0.260286 |  I mean what chance you got if you give gifting goals
[1706.38 - 1714.26] P:1541.40 E:0.262648 |  So 2-0 to England here in England on course on their way to a place in the last 16 with one match to spare four years ago
[1714.86 - 1717.90] P:1421.06 E:0.233114 |  Remember England were out after having played two matches
[1718.38 - 1725.30] P:1389.17 E:0.272248 |  Mind you there as you'll remember that we're playing Italy in Uruguay here England have had to play against Tunisia and Panama, but
[1726.26 - 1728.78] P:1592.32 E:0.272744 |  That's the look of the draw Roy Hodgson
[1728.78 - 1735.22] P:1489.08 E:0.281939 |  I'm sure we'll be looking at this and thinking of only my England team had had Tunisia and Panama to play in those first two matches in Brazil
[1735.54 - 1737.10] P:1647.38 E:0.218391 |  Here's Henderson
[1737.10 - 1743.94] P:1548.72 E:0.269985 |  Henderson playing it across towards Kyle Walker Walker pings one of those diagonal passes towards Lingard who latches onto this
[1743.94 - 1746.90] P:1417.59 E:0.272973 |  Inside the penalty area, but it just ran away from over the dead ball line
[1747.14 - 1749.18] P:1605.09 E:0.242525 |  And it's a gold kick to Panama Chris Waddle
[1749.18 - 1754.26] P:1404.42 E:0.269545 |  I've got how much time on the ball England now and a lot of Panama players are thinking how many is this gonna be?
[1755.18 - 1758.78] P:1703.64 E:0.285415 |  You know the working quite hard to give silly free kicks away all the time
[1758.78 - 1761.98] P:1623.85 E:0.294372 |  They've gifted England two goals and you've got to say England didn't really start very well
[1762.22 - 1768.90] P:1739.60 E:0.244380 |  They look nervous say what sloppy didn't play quick enough and they've been gifted to go so now they can relax and look after the ball
[1769.14 - 1775.50] P:1630.85 E:0.200710 |  Free kick to Panama half rain side their own half
[1776.70 - 1779.30] P:1641.91 E:0.226999 |  It's chipped out towards the left-hand side to
[1780.06 - 1787.78] P:1676.26 E:0.226063 |  Eric Davis who plays his football in Slovakia. He was voted into the Slovakian league team of the season
[1788.06 - 1790.06] P:1470.26 E:0.183761 |  he plays for
[1790.06 - 1795.38] P:1510.50 E:0.239792 |  Dronaiska Streda in Slovakia and now he's playing in the World Cup for Panama
[1795.54 - 1798.96] P:1621.54 E:0.234821 |  That that very much is the world game isn't it?
[1799.82 - 1804.62] P:1707.87 E:0.246913 |  England take the gold kick out towards Harry McGuire now towards Ashley young young
[1805.54 - 1808.06] P:1810.88 E:0.215684 |  Ashley young at the age of 32
[1808.74 - 1810.74] P:1615.31 E:0.236864 |  Playing in the World Cup for the first time
[1811.26 - 1816.02] P:1530.15 E:0.253287 |  Playing the ball across now Kyle Walker in possession Walker shuffled forward with it
[1816.02 - 1822.38] P:1520.47 E:0.254173 |  But then went square to John Stones and now Jesse Lingard back to Walker again first time touch to Henderson
[1822.38 - 1826.02] P:1400.36 E:0.264911 |  And now once again Kyle Walker takes it on a few more yards
[1826.02 - 1830.82] P:1563.19 E:0.257490 |  Give us a little ball into Harry Kane stun passed back to Henderson ball lifted over the top to Sterling who?
[1831.38 - 1835.42] P:1608.11 E:0.250880 |  Shakes off the defender, but the offside flag was up against Raheem Sterling free kick
[1835.42 - 1838.82] P:1424.50 E:0.279855 |  Perfect talking point right him still incumbent the game wasn't it will it be Rashford?
[1838.82 - 1843.50] P:1553.80 E:0.265295 |  He's not got into the game. It's always been caught offside two or three teams silly fouls a giveaway couple
[1844.58 - 1846.58] P:1486.24 E:0.224635 |  Very frustrating for him at the moment
[1847.14 - 1853.66] P:1486.38 E:0.256902 |  That's Chris Waddle played in the World Cup when England reached the quarter finals in Mexico played in the World Cup when England reached
[1853.66 - 1860.90] P:1638.86 E:0.253826 |  The semi-finals in Italy and at halftime back in the studio near Red Square with Mark Chapman will hear from the 1990
[1861.42 - 1863.90] P:1646.24 E:0.282257 |  World Cup captain Terry Butcher and Chris Sutton as well
[1863.90 - 1869.06] P:1686.30 E:0.243643 |  And then there will be 606 following this match when Kelly Cates will take the reins with
[1869.30 - 1873.22] P:1443.07 E:0.259908 |  Terry and Chris Sutton and we'll let you know when the lines are open for that
[1873.98 - 1878.90] P:1605.51 E:0.264614 |  During the course of a second half long ball fought towards Sterling but beaten in the air by a combination of
[1879.34 - 1881.22] P:1627.37 E:0.206570 |  Escobar and Torres
[1881.22 - 1888.06] P:1543.97 E:0.260268 |  Goalkeeper Pinedo it was it was odd wasn't it the way that Pinedo prepared to face the Harry Kane penalty?
[1888.14 - 1890.14] P:1520.22 E:0.248833 |  I'm sure they've seen anything like that
[1890.98 - 1892.34] P:1636.86 E:0.224139 |  nine games
[1892.34 - 1896.42] P:1552.98 E:0.269617 |  Well, they didn't work Harry won out. He certainly did that was Harry's game
[1897.14 - 1901.46] P:1619.87 E:0.265605 |  England to Panama nil or as they say here in Russia Gary Gary
[1901.94 - 1907.54] P:1674.29 E:0.237029 |  We've learned that the word Harry is pronounced in Russia like Gary
[1907.66 - 1911.14] P:1677.00 E:0.232705 |  So they talk about Gary Potter and Prince Gary
[1911.86 - 1916.26] P:1657.52 E:0.245230 |  So Harry or Gary Kane has given England a two-nil lead
[1916.26 - 1921.86] P:1509.08 E:0.254667 |  And here's Davis on the left-hand side Davis swills a long ball into the D on the edge of the England box
[1921.86 - 1925.82] P:1447.80 E:0.263648 |  But John Stones is there in position to head it away comes out to Rod Regat
[1926.22 - 1930.50] P:1754.27 E:0.263153 |  He turns all full of busy and hustle and bustle
[1931.46 - 1933.46] P:1654.52 E:0.235733 |  Then it's taken over by Godoy
[1933.58 - 1937.46] P:1541.91 E:0.281643 |  Davis this is good from Panama again playing the ball inside the England half
[1937.70 - 1944.54] P:1631.20 E:0.252311 |  A series of little passes at close quarters with the England players just standing off and then it goes back towards the halfway line
[1944.94 - 1947.70] P:1624.18 E:0.271414 |  Where Gomez will play it back into his own half
[1948.14 - 1953.10] P:1701.60 E:0.263219 |  To nil England if you just joined us on five live on this Sunday afternoon wherever you are
[1953.42 - 1957.86] P:1546.90 E:0.258540 |  And here is Muriel with the ball on the right-hand side infield towards
[1958.86 - 1960.18] P:1583.39 E:0.248932 |  Bar Senes
[1960.18 - 1964.38] P:1419.97 E:0.267351 |  Bar Senes receives it back and plays it out towards the left-hand side where
[1964.82 - 1968.86] P:1568.59 E:0.287334 |  Gabriel Gomez playing in this very deep line position the highly experienced
[1969.14 - 1973.90] P:1407.29 E:0.286249 |  Gabriel Gomez the player who's played more times to Panama than anyone else over the course of their footballing history
[1973.90 - 1978.18] P:1581.72 E:0.266669 |  And now it's stabbed forward by Davis off-trip yet out of play for a throw into Panama
[1978.42 - 1981.78] P:1524.45 E:0.271090 |  Halfway inside the England half. It's good play by Panama just keeping the ball
[1981.78 - 1984.86] P:1631.65 E:0.277647 |  But you can say it's good play by England that they're saving their energy
[1985.22 - 1988.66] P:1698.40 E:0.271924 |  They don't have to go chase chase chase and they've got a good shape at the minute
[1988.66 - 1989.74] P:1565.56 E:0.231178 |  They can't get behind them
[1989.74 - 1994.54] P:1658.45 E:0.248820 |  Which is exactly what Garaslav will have wanted from this game to get into a lead
[1994.54 - 2000.74] P:1695.23 E:0.246132 |  They've got a two goal lead and now able to whatever extent they can conserve their energy
[2000.74 - 2004.98] P:1733.44 E:0.281232 |  But Panama in possession playing the ball on the edge of the box and it slipped through now
[2004.98 - 2009.66] P:1749.86 E:0.320749 |  That took an affliction into the path of Rodriguez who goes for glory from the tightest of angles
[2009.66 - 2013.94] P:1677.22 E:0.289903 |  And he slashes it wide over the bar with two of his teammates waiting in the middle blast
[2013.98 - 2019.38] P:1677.45 E:0.263737 |  Blas Perez there the experienced striker says to him why didn't you just put it on my head?
[2019.50 - 2023.06] P:1613.99 E:0.269031 |  Well, it's not just that I think you've found a lot of countries now have improved
[2023.06 - 2026.74] P:1654.76 E:0.243027 |  You know organization wise and defensively in shape
[2026.98 - 2030.58] P:1551.82 E:0.248520 |  But that final third so important when he can't score goals and you can see
[2031.30 - 2034.90] P:1564.48 E:0.274162 |  Panama for all some of the approach plays nice. They do not look like scoring goals
[2035.62 - 2036.74] P:1569.40 E:0.258944 |  And you know as well
[2036.74 - 2039.14] P:1419.97 E:0.259547 |  I think there's an element as I said from those
[2039.94 - 2042.30] P:1600.13 E:0.299418 |  Journalists from Panama who I was speaking to here yesterday
[2042.82 - 2047.42] P:1385.33 E:0.250032 |  The whole country wants them to score a goal and I suspect the players will know that as well
[2047.42 - 2053.58] P:1482.75 E:0.249261 |  The players will think that they want to get a goal and I think I'm gonna go against England at this World Cup and as a result of that
[2054.26 - 2056.46] P:1663.88 E:0.229944 |  There's a there's a certain frenzy
[2056.46 - 2063.06] P:1687.65 E:0.248176 |  I think when they get into the England defensive third and they've lost their heads a couple of times already in that position that
[2063.10 - 2066.62] P:1493.15 E:0.269354 |  Opportunity that Godoy had inside the penalty area when it was still no no
[2066.66 - 2070.78] P:1624.98 E:0.232174 |  That was a great chance to give Panama the lead and he hit it badly wide
[2070.78 - 2075.54] P:1715.59 E:0.271724 |  So he has trippier on the right-hand side curling ball towards sterling sterling now round the defender
[2075.54 - 2079.90] P:1557.52 E:0.251623 |  But Pineda the goalkeeper comes out and is able to slide out on his side and gather the ball
[2079.90 - 2085.46] P:1634.97 E:0.250520 |  I think it was just playing a very slow tempo. What's there? You know, it seems Panama's got the ball good possession
[2086.42 - 2088.50] P:1675.70 E:0.248510 |  What's there? They're not hurt in the plane in front of England
[2088.50 - 2092.78] P:1644.16 E:0.270250 |  So, you know a lot of people later see England turn around get the ball back get it forward quick
[2093.06 - 2096.18] P:1601.52 E:0.269255 |  Very hot day in England at a minute on managing the game very well
[2096.18 - 2102.22] P:1671.33 E:0.261028 |  And there's a sugar in the back of lofters cheap lofters cheek who's come into the side to replace deli alley
[2102.54 - 2106.94] P:1601.65 E:0.255092 |  There's has not had the best opening half hour Raheem Sterling who kept this place
[2107.46 - 2112.62] P:1531.98 E:0.237152 |  Simply hasn't seen enough of the ball. He has Ashley young. There was some talk that that rose might come in
[2112.62 - 2118.30] P:1521.02 E:0.258390 |  I think it was always likely that Garry Southgate would stick with Ashley young and so he has he has walk and now playing it
[2118.30 - 2122.34] P:1701.98 E:0.259477 |  Towards sterling who tries to find a little bit of space to Panama players
[2122.66 - 2129.06] P:1602.16 E:0.248829 |  Come in either side of an ice trip does he played the ball for and it's a free kick to England just forward and right at the center circle
[2130.46 - 2136.02] P:1675.14 E:0.266824 |  Another set piece for me get it in the box because they don't need to roll it short get the center half's up
[2136.46 - 2138.22] P:1713.01 E:0.171604 |  Get a delivery in there
[2138.22 - 2141.18] P:1665.98 E:0.212109 |  Harry Kane prowling menacingly
[2141.74 - 2143.18] P:1570.18 E:0.209556 |  in the D
[2143.18 - 2145.18] P:1727.64 E:0.197243 |  walks across
[2145.18 - 2150.10] P:1677.56 E:0.243184 |  The free kick in a good position for trivia just to drop it in behind the back line
[2151.30 - 2152.82] P:1769.17 E:0.286942 |  Cain's actually made a
[2152.82 - 2155.78] P:1561.09 E:0.272313 |  Run out a move out towards the right hand side
[2155.78 - 2162.26] P:1579.80 E:0.253614 |  Maybe looking to pick up the pieces after the balls played to the back post to one of the central defenders stones and McGuire
[2162.46 - 2168.02] P:1687.54 E:0.262725 |  Are both up there lofters cheek to trivia does deliver it into the back post McGuire heads it across
[2168.02 - 2171.70] P:1700.07 E:0.245586 |  And it lands on the roof of the net goal kick to nil England
[2171.70 - 2176.62] P:1721.35 E:0.241611 |  Yep every set piece in there get and all your tempted attempts to think of something different
[2176.62 - 2181.34] P:1621.98 E:0.262760 |  Maybe just keep the ball roll it short, but why England are so powerful in the air
[2182.26 - 2186.54] P:1630.09 E:0.262101 |  Well, it's very unlucky as a back across the goal one fortune drops on top of the net
[2187.30 - 2192.14] P:1744.56 E:0.248837 |  Instead in the top corner. This is BBC 5 live every match here at this World Cup
[2192.14 - 2196.86] P:1626.60 E:0.253361 |  Whenever there's a match on you'll be able to hear commentary from us here at BBC radio
[2197.06 - 2201.28] P:1586.57 E:0.258423 |  Whether it's on 5 live on sports extra whether it's via the website
[2201.74 - 2204.86] P:1535.48 E:0.275500 |  You will be able to hear it and also I believe we're being listened to by
[2206.14 - 2210.50] P:1553.52 E:0.276115 |  Broadcasters in Canada during the course of this World Cup, so it's very good to have you with us as well
[2210.98 - 2217.78] P:1592.01 E:0.257850 |  That goal that Harry Kane has scored from the penalty spot here means he's obviously now scored three goals in the group stages of the World Cup
[2217.78 - 2226.86] P:1637.93 E:0.254005 |  That's not been done for England since Gary Lenaker back in 1986 in one of the World Cups that you played in where as we heard before the game Gary Lenaker
[2227.86 - 2233.00] P:1598.29 E:0.272916 |  Really made his name really took that step onto the world stage and that of course is what
[2233.50 - 2236.42] P:1492.06 E:0.281808 |  Harry Kane is attempting to do here. I mean, he's already a world player
[2236.42 - 2239.96] P:1639.13 E:0.280994 |  He has already you know feared as one of the best strikers in the world, but
[2240.42 - 2244.14] P:1605.28 E:0.264901 |  To score goals in a World Cup finals Chris is so important, isn't it?
[2247.14 - 2252.58] P:1531.13 E:0.273588 |  So for England as well and you know you want you number nine whoever is having man strike out of your foot in the ball in the back
[2253.38 - 2260.22] P:1615.28 E:0.258340 |  Harry Kane now 16 goals in 26 appearances for England, which is a very good record to nail England and the
[2260.62 - 2266.62] P:1479.92 E:0.255932 |  Sun probably a lone cloud has passed in front of the Sun, which is just disappeared for a moment or two
[2266.62 - 2267.90] P:1374.57 E:0.195225 |  They'll be back though
[2267.90 - 2269.42] P:1373.77 E:0.221420 |  Take my word for that
[2269.42 - 2274.26] P:1646.08 E:0.256620 |  There's trippier plays the ball back halfway into his own half just over 10 minutes to go to half time
[2274.46 - 2279.54] P:1714.62 E:0.255598 |  We will have quite a deal of time to be added on at the end of this first half for the lengthy stoppages
[2279.54 - 2285.90] P:1700.59 E:0.274852 |  We've had a couple of VAR's we've had the injury to Lingard Henderson now sweeping a ball down the left flank
[2285.90 - 2290.78] P:1651.55 E:0.276676 |  Young will do well to keep this in he has kept it in he'll do well to keep stop it from going out for a throw in
[2290.78 - 2294.10] P:1580.51 E:0.252895 |  He's failed to keep it from going out for a throwing. It's a great time
[2294.10 - 2296.30] P:1612.35 E:0.252758 |  A wing back makes a run forward
[2296.30 - 2301.18] P:1554.93 E:0.259379 |  There's nobody tracks him because the full boxer the wing backs have been tucked in the wingers ahead of them
[2301.18 - 2306.66] P:1401.99 E:0.266626 |  Do not want to run with the young or trippier so that ball is on all the time. What's he gonna go away?
[2306.66 - 2308.66] P:1695.85 E:0.188005 |  You'll get a lot of joy
[2308.98 - 2316.06] P:1643.76 E:0.247368 |  So the throwing to be taken by Maria with the the bleach blonde top to his hair throws it up towards
[2317.50 - 2321.66] P:1597.09 E:0.257104 |  Freak it conceded by stones for his challenge from behind on Barcelona's
[2322.58 - 2327.62] P:1511.12 E:0.285986 |  Davis has it on the left-hand side. Here's Rodriguez. There's been a run being made by Anibal Godoy Godoy
[2327.86 - 2331.50] P:1762.20 E:0.283850 |  Plays it forward just as Loftus cheek comes in from the with the challenge
[2331.50 - 2337.90] P:1543.40 E:0.253864 |  He goes down the balls played forward and the referee says no free kick off this cheek at a time that spot on because if not
[2338.66 - 2341.50] P:1398.57 E:0.263308 |  Would have been a second yellow. I think he's looked a little nervous
[2341.50 - 2348.88] P:1615.12 E:0.234926 |  I really don't think that the pitch surface is is helping the match in terms of the fact that it looks a little sticky as many
[2348.88 - 2350.88] P:1535.90 E:0.259550 |  But many of the pitches here have done
[2351.30 - 2355.66] P:1675.80 E:0.249300 |  the 2-0 to England and you know that the conversation is going to be
[2356.54 - 2359.70] P:1544.73 E:0.262235 |  Once England get these three points in the bag
[2360.22 - 2365.18] P:1618.49 E:0.277864 |  Over how many changes should be made for the Belgium game? How many changes will Belgium make?
[2365.22 - 2367.94] P:1621.59 E:0.270977 |  How important is it to finish first or second in the group?
[2368.66 - 2370.22] P:1666.40 E:0.264867 |  But for Garroth Southgate
[2370.22 - 2374.14] P:1561.60 E:0.274864 |  Yeah, you have to continue to be professional about it and think first of all
[2374.14 - 2378.18] P:1641.67 E:0.255641 |  We need to finish the job here against Panama. They pretty much got it done
[2378.18 - 2383.70] P:1522.27 E:0.250034 |  You would think two goals up on on a team like this one more goal would put it beyond doubt
[2383.90 - 2389.42] P:1624.61 E:0.254728 |  Here's young infield towards Lingard. Lingard with little ball now to Sterling Sterling back to Lingard
[2389.42 - 2392.34] P:1799.39 E:0.318179 |  This is nice. Lingard with a cardic shot. That's wonderful
[2392.70 - 2396.30] P:1801.26 E:0.329651 |  That's a super goal for England from Jesse Lingard
[2396.90 - 2400.86] P:1828.42 E:0.302036 |  3-0 England out of sight and we've still got
[2401.50 - 2407.34] P:1692.64 E:0.307126 |  Well over a half a football to player here in Nishne North Garad England 3 Panama 0
[2407.34 - 2411.14] P:1663.90 E:0.279061 |  That was a class goal by Jesse Lingard wasn't it picks it up
[2411.74 - 2415.82] P:1654.61 E:0.290011 |  Change your pace for the energy up to tempo 1 2
[2416.10 - 2421.90] P:1663.89 E:0.275256 |  What a finish inside the 4th him and Sterling link up brilliant. He just uses a defender to bend it around them
[2422.62 - 2427.18] P:1589.02 E:0.291329 |  And he just bends it around a great angle goalkeeper cannot get anywhere near it
[2427.46 - 2432.38] P:1613.64 E:0.276830 |  Scrapes that just hits under side of the bar and into the net what a goal by Jesse Lingard
[2433.30 - 2439.38] P:1707.72 E:0.273460 |  Jesse Lingard gets the feeling of scoring a goal at a World Cup finals for the very first time and it's 3-0
[2439.90 - 2441.42] P:1583.74 E:0.273786 |  Lovely finish lovely build up
[2441.42 - 2447.90] P:1628.34 E:0.262325 |  They picked their way really through the Panama players in red and in the end the curling shot from the edge of the penalty area
[2447.90 - 2452.30] P:1600.94 E:0.281409 |  There was nothing that Pinedo could do about it so England 3 Panama 0 and still
[2452.94 - 2455.58] P:1596.17 E:0.286188 |  Probably 10 minutes and more to play in this first half
[2455.98 - 2457.50] P:1656.63 E:0.242900 |  Well, let's be honest
[2457.50 - 2462.14] P:1516.88 E:0.267890 |  Panama given the game and spells but they can't defend we've saw that already especially set pieces
[2462.14 - 2465.54] P:1340.26 E:0.282597 |  But in that case that was just a very good goal and I would be good goal against anybody
[2465.90 - 2468.46] P:1557.66 E:0.259511 |  Lovely one two with Sterling and what a finish
[2468.94 - 2472.22] P:1379.83 E:0.280673 |  Uses a defender as I said that gives them the angle to bend around them
[2472.78 - 2476.14] P:1548.83 E:0.282657 |  Great finish and it's it's game over now. It's just how many England want to score
[2476.86 - 2483.26] P:1378.87 E:0.260821 |  And Sterling very much played his part in that goal that'll maybe settle him a little played a really important part
[2483.66 - 2486.78] P:1382.37 E:0.284101 |  That was Manchester City and Manchester United combined for England
[2487.10 - 2489.34] P:1433.34 E:0.289611 |  All played into the penalty area but straight at stones
[2489.66 - 2494.06] P:1256.36 E:0.272720 |  He was able to turn and clear it away now Jordan Henderson has space inside his own half
[2494.06 - 2497.02] P:1475.07 E:0.280603 |  Lovely little touch from the man who's just scored that goal Jesse Lingard
[2497.02 - 2501.82] P:1487.20 E:0.273669 |  But it breaks down between Lingard and Henderson and now Barcelona plays it to the left hand side
[2501.82 - 2507.74] P:1447.70 E:0.268566 |  Rodriguez is there the left winger Rodriguez taking on Trippier pulls it back onto his right foot but uses his left
[2508.22 - 2510.22] P:1162.59 E:0.227572 |  and he has support there
[2510.46 - 2512.86] P:1616.70 E:0.298762 |  And Davis's ball in takes a touch Perez
[2513.34 - 2519.10] P:1491.12 E:0.264238 |  But the touch wasn't enough to deflect it on goal and it was his haste far post for a goal kick to England 3-0
[2519.18 - 2522.62] P:1353.07 E:0.261465 |  It's a bit fair. They can't defend. We know that Panama but going forward
[2522.70 - 2524.94] P:1346.34 E:0.283263 |  They're not too bad. They've got a lot of movement on energy
[2525.02 - 2528.54] P:1523.15 E:0.283202 |  It's that final third out John and when you get it in your box, that's where the good teams
[2529.18 - 2532.14] P:1249.55 E:0.280535 |  Put the ball in the bottom there and forward to Panama are not going to do that
[2532.22 - 2534.62] P:1462.43 E:0.285532 |  So some of the approach plays okay. It's good on the eye
[2535.26 - 2537.26] P:1424.14 E:0.278310 |  But you just can see they're not going to score goals
[2538.06 - 2540.86] P:1460.85 E:0.304990 |  1-0 in the eighth minute through John Stone's header
[2541.50 - 2543.34] P:1434.73 E:0.253269 |  2-0 in the 22nd
[2543.34 - 2549.66] P:1451.82 E:0.271232 |  Harry Kane's penalty after Lingard was fouled and Lingard himself scored the third in the 36
[2549.74 - 2557.74] P:1485.86 E:0.267684 |  So it's 3-0 to England and another free kick is conceded by Panama. This is just about in the middle of the Panama half
[2558.54 - 2563.74] P:1377.58 E:0.284552 |  Worth a hit with these modern day balls and not give the ball back. They're not one of the get booked in that. They're just silly aren't they?
[2564.86 - 2567.90] P:1344.51 E:0.282445 |  Why don't we just give the ball back and go back what they're trying to prove so
[2568.70 - 2570.70] P:1370.40 E:0.292904 |  The 3-0 down look they're arguing again
[2571.26 - 2575.34] P:1332.95 E:0.241616 |  And deputy a red today by the way. I'm not about their shirts neither. Yeah
[2577.10 - 2579.74] P:1352.13 E:0.270715 |  You're going for red card. Yeah. Yeah red card for Panama
[2580.46 - 2582.22] P:1566.12 E:0.228940 |  Okay
[2582.22 - 2584.22] P:1647.49 E:0.282603 |  Only one of them's being booked so far
[2584.86 - 2586.22] P:1670.94 E:0.233564 |  Cooper
[2586.22 - 2591.10] P:1617.21 E:0.276839 |  I don't know why Harry Kane doesn't hit this but a terrific shot. I don't know. That's what I said to you during the Tunisia game
[2591.42 - 2595.10] P:1593.47 E:0.273811 |  We've seen Trippier take three or four free kicks in the you know, there's no pace on them
[2595.58 - 2597.58] P:1541.94 E:0.256317 |  God pass the post on to the goalie's arms
[2599.34 - 2601.50] P:1444.81 E:0.279610 |  I'm not sure he was even a contender to take it
[2602.94 - 2604.94] P:1486.02 E:0.261853 |  Free kick then Trippier
[2606.46 - 2609.66] P:1488.60 E:0.298064 |  Ashley Young's just standing in front of the ball. It's a two-man Panama wall
[2610.62 - 2612.62] P:1471.22 E:0.229936 |  Panama wall as opposed to canal
[2613.10 - 2614.22] P:1441.96 E:0.207462 |  Trippier
[2614.22 - 2619.58] P:1432.17 E:0.282873 |  Waiting to take it Walker just comes up behind him Panama. I've got everyone back behind the ball here 3-0 down
[2620.38 - 2621.26] P:1438.44 E:0.244403 |  Oh
[2621.26 - 2627.98] P:1618.64 E:0.268242 |  And the referee is just saying there's some pushing and pulling on the edge of the area. I think on leftist cheek
[2628.78 - 2632.62] P:1606.32 E:0.294659 |  Or is it Kane? Anyway, it's taken short by Trippier. It's played over the top by Henderson
[2632.70 - 2636.46] P:1797.49 E:0.343513 |  It's headed across well good save from sterling, but it's finished off at the back post
[2637.02 - 2639.02] P:1832.68 E:0.322816 |  John Stones has scored another one
[2639.18 - 2643.66] P:1827.15 E:0.344651 |  Two goal John Stones at the World Cup and it's 4-0 to England before halftime
[2644.22 - 2648.22] P:1704.71 E:0.307973 |  By the way John every set piece that was well worked by the way. I've got to give credit to England there
[2648.70 - 2650.70] P:1742.10 E:0.300935 |  Oh checking if I'm possible offside
[2651.18 - 2653.42] P:1685.81 E:0.294802 |  Leading up to the goal. So don't
[2654.14 - 2658.46] P:1641.35 E:0.286728 |  Righted that well, it's too late. I have written it down, but I might need my tip x pen here
[2659.10 - 2661.10] P:1596.49 E:0.261265 |  England are celebrating
[2661.10 - 2667.66] P:1662.82 E:0.276367 |  But VAR it's the it's the South African official Danny Macalee who is the he's off
[2669.50 - 2671.50] P:1634.18 E:0.325283 |  So he was offside originally
[2672.06 - 2676.22] P:1524.73 E:0.287800 |  Originally and the ball falls to him and he heads it in the roof of the net from a couple of years out
[2676.22 - 2682.06] P:1519.91 E:0.246516 |  I would think they'd give it because it's the next phase. Yeah next phase. So he was offside originally, but
[2683.58 - 2689.34] P:1545.94 E:0.275020 |  Says they're still checking on the on our screen here, but the players have gone back into position
[2689.98 - 2691.98] P:1696.67 E:0.247479 |  And the referee is just waiting
[2692.70 - 2697.50] P:1480.35 E:0.281573 |  And he is speaking we can see because he has his hand to his ear. He says don't kick off yet to Panama
[2698.14 - 2700.14] P:1518.10 E:0.290041 |  because he's waiting for the final say so
[2700.78 - 2703.90] P:1488.35 E:0.259702 |  From the the video assistant referee
[2705.98 - 2707.98] P:1666.96 E:0.252894 |  We're still waiting
[2707.98 - 2710.70] P:1558.64 E:0.301337 |  And the Panama players are saying why can't we kick off here?
[2712.14 - 2715.18] P:1516.43 E:0.291272 |  That's because the definitive final decision has not been made yet
[2715.26 - 2720.78] P:1648.20 E:0.251883 |  I think it's an interest not to kick off the way they're playing the the the dutch video assistant referee Danny
[2721.26 - 2723.26] P:1587.63 E:0.253514 |  Macalee is still looking at this
[2724.86 - 2726.86] P:1510.00 E:0.282733 |  And the referee now on the field
[2727.58 - 2733.18] P:1495.97 E:0.264124 |  Is explaining to the Panama players that this might be a a ruling in your favor here
[2734.46 - 2738.54] P:1611.96 E:0.286715 |  But no it has been given it is John Stone's goal and it is England for
[2739.02 - 2744.38] P:1476.28 E:0.246135 |  Panama nil and we've got four minutes plus plenty of added time by the way well worked set piece
[2744.38 - 2749.50] P:1518.98 E:0.267389 |  I've got to say it was great to watch their movement in the way they did it and what's the training ground routine
[2750.22 - 2753.66] P:1588.70 E:0.282872 |  They say England looks so strong at set pieces. They can win games on set pieces
[2754.62 - 2757.26] P:1589.68 E:0.279679 |  And just to explain again Chris the reason that was given
[2757.50 - 2760.94] P:1568.89 E:0.270868 |  Stones was in an offside position when the free kick was taken over by Tripp here
[2760.94 - 2764.62] P:1403.75 E:0.226919 |  But they've considered that the play moved into a second phase
[2765.42 - 2770.46] P:1547.15 E:0.258029 |  Before it made its way two stones who headed it in close to him. He played them on in the second phase
[2770.46 - 2773.42] P:1484.60 E:0.232574 |  So that was where I got it. So it took a while to
[2774.22 - 2776.30] P:1580.24 E:0.213328 |  sort it out but
[2776.30 - 2777.98] P:1674.92 E:0.229759 |  How many did England want?
[2777.98 - 2783.26] P:1554.49 E:0.254371 |  John Stone's the record scorer World Cup game. Well, I think that was Hungry El Salvador, wasn't it? 10-1
[2784.22 - 2786.22] P:1842.95 E:0.259828 |  In 82
[2786.46 - 2788.86] P:1412.95 E:0.305664 |  Well, look out to us. Look out. It's out for one hit
[2790.06 - 2792.06] P:1606.93 E:0.203591 |  In this heat though
[2792.06 - 2794.06] P:1650.81 E:0.295547 |  You think that anyway here they come again
[2794.14 - 2799.90] P:1629.71 E:0.268079 |  And now the ball's played across for Lingard to hit a shot that strikes the back of a defender and takes it wide of goal for a corner
[2800.30 - 2802.06] P:1670.26 E:0.200383 |  to England
[2802.06 - 2807.50] P:1497.04 E:0.303707 |  And they start arguing a bit among themselves now Panama and he has another set piece coming and this could be another goal
[2808.46 - 2810.70] P:1475.53 E:0.301215 |  They can't defend against them in England. They're very good at them
[2811.66 - 2813.66] P:1497.10 E:0.249346 |  And that spells trouble for Panama
[2814.06 - 2815.90] P:1807.74 E:0.212615 |  Well, everyone who got up
[2815.90 - 2819.26] P:1635.10 E:0.274184 |  7 a.m. In the morning John Stone's on a hot trick back in Panama
[2820.38 - 2826.38] P:1517.62 E:0.271081 |  They might witness a John Stone's hat trick. That's something that I know for sure has never been seen at a World Cup before
[2827.26 - 2833.26] P:1565.00 E:0.242193 |  It's a corner from the right then for England and and you know that there are definite signs here
[2833.90 - 2835.90] P:1541.34 E:0.247105 |  That the referee in this match
[2835.98 - 2839.02] P:1587.73 E:0.278930 |  Gahad Grisha has taken note FIFA have taken note
[2839.34 - 2846.06] P:1433.91 E:0.272739 |  Because he is very hot here on holding inside the penalty area and he's making it very clear to the Panama players
[2846.70 - 2850.86] P:1447.73 E:0.271417 |  The defender with Harry Kane has his arms around it, but not holding it now
[2850.94 - 2852.30] P:1666.94 E:0.322875 |  Kane is being hold over
[2852.30 - 2853.50] P:1647.24 E:0.272850 |  Kane's being hold over
[2853.50 - 2859.58] P:1638.83 E:0.303723 |  Maguire heads it goalwards and it's being caught and the penalty's being given to England well done for the holding on Harry Kane
[2861.18 - 2863.18] P:1767.30 E:0.243236 |  There we are it's easy
[2863.66 - 2865.66] P:1747.48 E:0.226833 |  Well done referee
[2866.86 - 2870.46] P:1613.05 E:0.269447 |  The uh about time the video assistant referee is being
[2871.26 - 2873.50] P:1376.81 E:0.244442 |  Consulted but the referee has given this
[2874.46 - 2878.30] P:1556.78 E:0.297511 |  They are checking the foul they're checking to see if it is a foul. I mean the pictures we have been shown
[2879.34 - 2881.34] P:1381.70 E:0.275104 |  on mario on stones, but it was
[2881.42 - 2884.70] P:1372.07 E:0.285848 |  I mean we could see with the naked eye it was harry kane who was being pulled over
[2885.26 - 2890.86] P:1500.04 E:0.269749 |  No, look harry kane. You know we're getting a bothered for every player. It is unbelievable. That's a tango never mind the walls
[2890.94 - 2892.14] P:1397.81 E:0.239840 |  God I
[2892.14 - 2895.50] P:1407.28 E:0.262988 |  Was all over him all over him. It's a penalty all day
[2895.66 - 2899.26] P:1615.88 E:0.244040 |  But the referees went up to them every corner and said stop holding
[2900.62 - 2904.22] P:1483.14 E:0.274814 |  So a chance for harry kane to score another one and move alongside
[2905.02 - 2905.98] P:1404.66 E:0.241854 |  messers
[2905.98 - 2907.42] P:1634.46 E:0.201256 |  Ronaldo
[2907.42 - 2912.30] P:1604.97 E:0.241917 |  And lucarcu as the joint leading scorer at will cook 2018
[2913.10 - 2917.10] P:1506.59 E:0.276262 |  And this has been where the game is going harry kane could get five or six today
[2917.50 - 2922.62] P:1584.99 E:0.277790 |  Yellow cards being shown in there as well to one of the panamar players. I think it's escobar
[2923.58 - 2926.06] P:1598.64 E:0.281307 |  That might have been something that he said
[2926.86 - 2932.06] P:1567.06 E:0.270321 |  Now torres the captain his fellow central defender is complaining about that how long does this take for
[2932.70 - 2935.02] P:1707.09 E:0.254617 |  What was give him a red and get him off?
[2935.34 - 2939.34] P:1670.99 E:0.269168 |  We must have there must be 10 minutes of added time to play at the end of this first half
[2939.66 - 2941.66] P:1622.05 E:0.244588 |  Might as well play the ball half again
[2943.98 - 2944.62] P:1840.96 E:0.252458 |  Uh
[2944.62 - 2948.30] P:1573.30 E:0.273383 |  Show this by the way players are still going around inside the penalty area
[2948.54 - 2953.02] P:1636.51 E:0.292713 |  Wonder what the gulkier is going to do here after his laissez-faire approach to the first
[2953.02 - 2957.58] P:1491.08 E:0.258782 |  There he does a handstand listen at the moment. He's actually standing two yards in front of harry kane again
[2957.58 - 2959.90] P:1410.26 E:0.281885 |  He can't stay there and not save it from here neither
[2961.34 - 2964.22] P:1495.60 E:0.272196 |  Harry kane's pulling the ball on the spot as if he wasn't there
[2964.94 - 2968.94] P:1543.68 E:0.271572 |  Pineda, I'm not sure if he's talking to harry kane kane stands up looks at the referee
[2969.26 - 2973.10] P:1581.42 E:0.258642 |  The referee's currently checking to see that the panamar players are outside the penalty area
[2973.58 - 2975.90] P:1597.56 E:0.264767 |  The gulkier are still standing next to kane
[2976.54 - 2981.26] P:1617.98 E:0.268398 |  Now turns away. He always spotted a little bit of rubbish on the ground in the six yard box
[2981.90 - 2983.90] P:1662.98 E:0.200264 |  Is it mondia?
[2983.90 - 2987.34] P:1551.75 E:0.258923 |  Now panado is back on the line and we can see this penalty
[2987.82 - 2992.22] P:1666.18 E:0.272613 |  Be taken so this for harry kane's fourth goal at this world cup from the penalty spot
[2992.62 - 2997.26] P:1751.38 E:0.282720 |  If it's as good as the last one, we'll be in the net. Here comes kane. It is as good as the last one
[2997.58 - 2999.58] P:1790.65 E:0.334711 |  It's two goals for harry kane today
[2999.82 - 3002.78] P:1788.59 E:0.306473 |  It's four goals for harry kane at this world cup
[3002.94 - 3009.02] P:1708.20 E:0.302788 |  He's the joint leading scorer and england are five nil and this really against panamar is too easy
[3009.34 - 3013.66] P:1688.86 E:0.292068 |  So easy it's going to be a cricket score just saw him beat australia. This is going to be the same score
[3013.66 - 3015.02] P:1739.25 E:0.245039 |  Why it looks at it?
[3015.02 - 3017.42] P:1510.39 E:0.303906 |  Unbelievable every time they go four they're going to score
[3018.62 - 3022.30] P:1474.40 E:0.296908 |  Unbelievable what a pen again by the way. How hard does he hit that? Wow
[3025.50 - 3031.82] P:1591.62 E:0.270151 |  England five panamar nil and how much additional time have it two minutes
[3032.94 - 3035.26] P:1482.49 E:0.289882 |  Two minutes now he means two days
[3038.54 - 3040.54] P:1400.52 E:0.286056 |  It's not real is it?
[3041.34 - 3043.34] P:1431.99 E:0.321925 |  That's producer gary's seen the board
[3044.22 - 3047.82] P:1651.06 E:0.304567 |  England go straight off this pitch and go on the next pitch to play belgian the way he's going
[3050.22 - 3053.42] P:1592.96 E:0.257027 |  Straight to kelin ingrad do not pass mosco
[3054.94 - 3059.42] P:1564.93 E:0.238030 |  So it's five nil to england. We're almost at half time
[3059.82 - 3064.62] P:1589.98 E:0.246240 |  We have harry maguire's down harry maguire has been caught there
[3065.02 - 3069.98] P:1573.95 E:0.250941 |  It's a it's a clash as he challenged for the ball kupa with kupa who's been booked
[3071.18 - 3073.18] P:1481.10 E:0.255201 |  Already in this match kupa
[3073.82 - 3077.10] P:1453.33 E:0.259015 |  I've got the feeling that was just a coming together, you know
[3077.90 - 3079.90] P:1258.24 E:0.272280 |  And maguire turn
[3080.54 - 3082.54] P:1376.15 E:0.206384 |  Oh, he's he he's lit
[3083.18 - 3089.34] P:1461.38 E:0.273202 |  So kupa challenging and he's caught by an arm it's just a flailing
[3091.26 - 3094.06] P:1444.70 E:0.288192 |  You're giving me that is not a flailing or not a frame whatever you're saying
[3094.86 - 3101.98] P:1415.49 E:0.248870 |  Because his fist is clenched. Yeah, he's looking to catch the opponent. He's telling me go off the pitch. No, he said i'm not going off. He said okay stay on
[3104.78 - 3109.34] P:1440.17 E:0.257764 |  Well, we've already played these laughable two minutes that added time
[3110.06 - 3113.98] P:1348.08 E:0.260193 |  That have been indicated at the end of the first half maguire is
[3114.86 - 3116.86] P:1354.23 E:0.256758 |  spitting down on the pitch
[3117.26 - 3120.94] P:1285.04 E:0.282499 |  I don't know if there is a little bit of blood there or not, but he he doesn't have to go off the field
[3121.98 - 3123.98] P:1264.14 E:0.310033 |  And and torres as well
[3124.70 - 3127.26] P:1228.23 E:0.282211 |  Torres put his head into harry maguire's head
[3127.90 - 3131.34] P:1354.26 E:0.287349 |  This was in the aftermath of that when they were standing up and everyone was uh
[3131.82 - 3138.14] P:1340.17 E:0.267337 |  Was milling around talking about it. I think the heads did touch, isn't it? Yeah, definitely. Well the video referee can look at that
[3139.34 - 3141.34] P:1393.18 E:0.290583 |  I mean you can check red card offences
[3143.66 - 3146.14] P:1391.11 E:0.304188 |  So presumably they'll see that in the mosco bunker
[3146.94 - 3151.82] P:1509.07 E:0.266873 |  But if it gets to half time and no action has been taken they can't go back to that incidentally
[3152.70 - 3157.34] P:1330.29 E:0.308824 |  So the score line here bbc radio five live england's second match at this world cup. They're on their way through
[3157.58 - 3162.06] P:1458.09 E:0.258040 |  They're on their way to victory. It's five nil and really the second half here is going to be a procession
[3162.06 - 3165.74] P:1451.10 E:0.290065 |  Which is exactly and there is the halftime whistle. We played precisely three minutes
[3166.38 - 3168.38] P:1765.16 E:0.288324 |  of time at the end of the first half
[3168.78 - 3173.90] P:1629.45 E:0.291248 |  But that is exactly what garrison's gate will have wanted in the first half here because the game's out of sight in these
[3173.98 - 3179.90] P:1629.20 E:0.274517 |  Stiflingly hot conditions england really should just now manage it to the final whistle in the second half
[3180.22 - 3184.14] P:1513.53 E:0.304854 |  Well done england you've got to say they've managed the game. Well every step please every time at four
[3184.22 - 3186.54] P:1715.84 E:0.291887 |  They're going to score and tell me they want to score now
[3187.02 - 3192.30] P:1433.10 E:0.279707 |  Actually the panamore team and squad are getting together in the center without the manager
[3192.86 - 3194.86] P:1347.34 E:0.259873 |  And they have the meeting the whole
[3195.10 - 3199.58] P:1539.10 E:0.287582 |  Team and the substitutes are going across there as well the england players are now leaving the field
[3200.22 - 3205.02] P:1539.80 E:0.290187 |  And the substitutes are coming on but the panamore team are stayed out on the pitch in the center circle
[3205.74 - 3208.86] P:1444.19 E:0.309152 |  And there's no sign of urn and darryl gourmet's. Yes, there he is actually
[3209.26 - 3213.90] P:1530.86 E:0.256316 |  He's standing on the edge of his coaching area with his hands on his hips as if to say
[3214.94 - 3216.94] P:1312.03 E:0.216434 |  What what are you doing?
[3217.10 - 3220.22] P:1336.16 E:0.267385 |  And now the players turn having called the substitutes out
[3220.70 - 3225.42] P:1479.68 E:0.273650 |  Let's just see what the interaction is like with coach gourmet's as they walk past him
[3226.54 - 3228.54] P:1549.50 E:0.296047 |  Five nil down at halftime panamore
[3229.26 - 3230.94] P:1567.68 E:0.220679 |  They walk past him
[3230.94 - 3238.14] P:1527.92 E:0.244439 |  Without too much of a reaction from either party. I think that's going to be an interesting panamore dressing room at halftime
[3238.14 - 3240.14] P:1555.59 E:0.255756 |  I don't know. John if he's going to follow them in
[3241.18 - 3245.02] P:1686.66 E:0.301677 |  He's just stand looking at him and nobody's looking at him as they walk past him. He's just stood in the
[3245.90 - 3249.42] P:1594.17 E:0.270423 |  He's starting slowly to walk behind him. I don't think he's going to go in
[3250.46 - 3252.46] P:1640.87 E:0.284150 |  He's now talking to some of his staff there
[3254.22 - 3259.98] P:1485.13 E:0.269943 |  This is the the columbian coach of panamore the players have now disappeared from our site into the blue tunnel
[3261.18 - 3265.26] P:1569.98 E:0.285710 |  And the panamore coach is still standing out there with his with his coaching assistant
[3265.26 - 3271.74] P:1479.97 E:0.266458 |  So we'll just keep an eye on on him as we return you to our studio in red square in moscow
[3272.14 - 3277.66] P:1590.49 E:0.258869 |  Where mark Chapman and terry butcher and chris suck my waiting for us with a score line of england five
[3278.06 - 3280.06] P:1292.02 E:0.278727 |  Panamore nil at halftime
[3280.14 - 3284.70] P:1443.04 E:0.252819 |  Well, you said mark there one of our listeners got in touch saying it could be a record score
[3285.34 - 3288.46] P:1592.71 E:0.257964 |  It is going to be a record score believe it or not england's biggest win
[3288.78 - 3294.30] P:1514.78 E:0.262830 |  That they've ever had at a world cup finals tournament as the second half gets underway here in nision in off garod
[3294.70 - 3302.30] P:1666.33 E:0.241781 |  Is by three goals three nil wins. They've had three of those poland 86 paraguay in 86 and then it
[3303.34 - 3305.34] P:1487.44 E:0.226696 |  2002 in the last 16
[3305.42 - 3313.26] P:1573.35 E:0.236757 |  Against denmark. So it will be a record victory for england at a world cup finals tournament
[3313.26 - 3317.18] P:1423.16 E:0.241000 |  That we're going to see here barring a comeback from panamore that i think would be
[3318.14 - 3320.30] P:1465.53 E:0.257909 |  fanciful to suggest might happen
[3320.94 - 3325.90] P:1638.35 E:0.289836 |  And it is also the first time that england have scored three goals in a match at a world cup
[3326.38 - 3328.38] P:1636.02 E:0.217932 |  Since 2002
[3328.38 - 3332.54] P:1527.14 E:0.298477 |  So we are underway in the second half no changes for either side
[3332.94 - 3337.18] P:1549.76 E:0.286476 |  And we saw pictures from the tunnel on our screens here of the panamore players coming out
[3337.58 - 3342.06] P:1498.91 E:0.262900 |  And there seemed to be a certain amount of disgruntlement chris waddle as they did so mutiny
[3342.38 - 3343.26] P:1712.46 E:0.216916 |  um
[3343.26 - 3348.54] P:1520.04 E:0.259466 |  mutiny there was uh, you could see they're all talking about what the coach must have said whether they agreed or not
[3348.54 - 3352.62] P:1582.26 E:0.253781 |  They're all saying the wrong thing often weren't listening but in the tunnel to each other
[3353.34 - 3357.10] P:1484.58 E:0.254074 |  They um, I'm very disappointed and it it's up to england yet
[3357.66 - 3360.06] P:1474.70 E:0.266190 |  All they need to do is get set pieces more than anything
[3360.70 - 3367.74] P:1548.52 E:0.292736 |  That's chris waddle with us on bbc radio five live at the world cup here in russia and we are watching jessie lingard coming forward for england
[3367.74 - 3373.50] P:1628.46 E:0.274030 |  I will run you through those teams england making just the one change with ruben lofters cheek taking the place of deli ali
[3374.30 - 3377.50] P:1537.97 E:0.272925 |  But england in possession with kyle walker walker
[3377.58 - 3380.70] P:1385.44 E:0.291566 |  I did wonder whether he might come out because he's on a yellow card
[3381.10 - 3385.18] P:1417.25 E:0.317044 |  But the ball is played through now for harry kane left side of the penalty area who's got away from torres
[3385.18 - 3389.66] P:1430.61 E:0.293506 |  But is forced wide and kane then plays it back towards ashley young england playing from left to right
[3390.06 - 3392.86] P:1351.29 E:0.301664 |  As we look from up here high on the dressing room side
[3393.02 - 3396.70] P:1451.20 E:0.306977 |  It ball slipped into sterling sterling angles it across towards lofters cheek
[3396.86 - 3400.86] P:1275.41 E:0.304038 |  But the defender davis was able to come in and just get there ahead of lofters cheek
[3401.10 - 3403.74] P:1186.40 E:0.315609 |  So england start again from near the halfway line
[3404.30 - 3406.14] P:1339.35 E:0.273405 |  pigford engol
[3406.14 - 3410.54] P:1181.79 E:0.298622 |  walk at stones and maguire at the central defenders trippie run young at the wing backs
[3410.86 - 3415.50] P:1391.40 E:0.272464 |  Henderson lingard and lofters cheek in midfield with sterling behind harry kane
[3415.90 - 3419.34] P:1248.83 E:0.289179 |  And the panamar team with panado engol mario
[3419.74 - 3422.62] P:1436.76 E:0.267308 |  romantores escobar and davis the back four
[3423.18 - 3426.46] P:1343.17 E:0.289465 |  Gomez in the center of midfield with cooper and godeye either side of him
[3426.62 - 3432.94] P:1324.83 E:0.263555 |  barsenas on the right rodriguez on the left and pares up front and panamar in the all red kit
[3434.38 - 3441.26] P:1558.74 E:0.286674 |  With the white numbers and the white trim are in possession inside their own half england first choice kits for this one
[3441.26 - 3444.14] P:1505.56 E:0.233399 |  white shirts blue shorts and white socks and
[3444.54 - 3448.30] P:1484.61 E:0.285534 |  rodriguez loses possession so lofters cheek turns it back in field towards trippie
[3448.46 - 3452.70] P:1589.00 E:0.283531 |  In fact Henderson gets there first with a past kane who flips it over the top for sterling
[3452.86 - 3455.58] P:1458.24 E:0.283035 |  But the headers won by escobar on the edge of the penalty area
[3455.74 - 3459.18] P:1476.57 E:0.269327 |  And panamar will look to pass the ball away from the back again
[3459.34 - 3461.66] P:1589.78 E:0.292118 |  Number of the substitutes are warming up down there
[3462.22 - 3467.02] P:1481.77 E:0.282189 |  But they are panamar substitutes no immediate sign of a change for england pares pares
[3467.34 - 3470.94] P:1504.61 E:0.293924 |  Puls the ball down on the halfway line and plays it centrally to godoy
[3471.34 - 3473.98] P:1484.73 E:0.319324 |  Now it's out the barsenas on the right hand side who's cutting in field
[3473.98 - 3479.82] P:1481.78 E:0.305128 |  He's waiting for support from the outside from mario and then plays a ball in which is nowhere near cooper inside the penalty area
[3479.82 - 3481.82] P:1363.75 E:0.308520 |  It just runs through to pick that earlier again
[3482.30 - 3486.94] P:1435.83 E:0.305574 |  Yeah, so good football by panamar to get to the 18 yard line and again run out of idea
[3486.94 - 3492.86] P:1693.02 E:0.313696 |  Kane plays it through for sterling sterling's on side goalkeeper comes out and makes a tackle on sterling on the edge of the penalty area
[3492.86 - 3495.34] P:1617.14 E:0.253294 |  Just outside the box a good tackle it was as well
[3495.66 - 3497.34] P:1633.88 E:0.279506 |  Strong challenge by the keeper isn't it?
[3497.34 - 3499.34] P:1900.12 E:0.208344 |  Sterling's just got up now
[3499.34 - 3503.74] P:1692.47 E:0.256701 |  But it's you've got to watch lofters cheek as well. He's on a yellow. So any silly challenge
[3504.46 - 3506.46] P:1527.79 E:0.247665 |  Anything late
[3506.46 - 3509.58] P:1435.21 E:0.286096 |  Got a monitor that as well. But it's how many goals in you want to score. Yeah
[3509.66 - 3513.98] P:1515.89 E:0.270288 |  Loftus cheek has been yellow carded in this game walkers on a yellow card from the first match
[3514.70 - 3519.50] P:1503.81 E:0.275009 |  In terms of a suspension for the belgium game, but england leading panamar by five goals to nil

[3557.74 - 3559.74] P:1543.80 E:0.201127 |  Which was the pick of the goals
[3559.74 - 3561.34] P:1516.92 E:0.175047 |  and england
[3561.34 - 3567.98] P:1588.00 E:0.262369 |  Defending at the moment with lingard the ball bounces away from him though peres tries to play through the england backline
[3567.98 - 3570.30] P:1552.85 E:0.280966 |  There's a little bit of hesitation between walker and trippier
[3570.78 - 3573.18] P:1401.34 E:0.267642 |  But walker runs away with the ball into the full back position
[3573.82 - 3577.74] P:1488.13 E:0.276525 |  And as he pulls it back the challenge came in and he pulled it back behind the dead ball line
[3577.74 - 3583.10] P:1693.82 E:0.269101 |  So panamar have their first corner. Yeah, he could have played it away. Co water a little drag back there little
[3583.74 - 3585.74] P:1746.66 E:0.301790 |  Turn and it's just run out of play
[3587.50 - 3589.02] P:1721.55 E:0.281309 |  And then as I say
[3589.02 - 3590.78] P:1720.28 E:0.280916 |  Look good at set pieces in both boxes
[3590.78 - 3596.54] P:1716.54 E:0.278771 |  So chris i'll ask you what the correct approach should be the professional approach for england in this second half bearing
[3596.54 - 3600.54] P:1541.42 E:0.284160 |  Mind this is lobby don't let slobby keep the tempo right move the ball when you have to don't answer yet
[3600.94 - 3603.66] P:1609.03 E:0.303291 |  Corner from the left hand side for panamar. It's flicked on at the near post
[3603.66 - 3609.26] P:1541.91 E:0.257679 |  But it's headed away at the back post for england by walker and england will break away on the counter attack as
[3610.46 - 3613.50] P:1678.66 E:0.254168 |  Henderson has challenged by both
[3614.62 - 3619.74] P:1582.01 E:0.276208 |  From both sides by a combination of davis and rodriguez and now here is rodriguez on the left
[3619.74 - 3625.10] P:1495.09 E:0.248551 |  But he can't keep the ball in and it's a throwing for england deep inside their own half point being point being
[3626.38 - 3627.82] P:1706.19 E:0.279499 |  Looking further ahead
[3627.82 - 3634.14] P:1605.15 E:0.258236 |  Obviously england want to progress in this tournament. Do you just just keep it steady steady performance in the second half?
[3634.14 - 3637.98] P:1584.72 E:0.265120 |  Just play the game out. Don't don't get risk. Don't don't take liberties. Don't get injuries
[3638.30 - 3642.06] P:1640.64 E:0.265825 |  Um, just keep the ball moving do what you did first half really, you know
[3642.38 - 3644.94] P:1486.33 E:0.276333 |  And if you get set pieces put in there, there are easy goals the gifts
[3645.18 - 3649.98] P:1576.98 E:0.252581 |  So just keep the ball on don't get slobby. Don't concede and you know, don't let people say well

[3784.62 - 3792.38] P:1621.75 E:0.261037 |  No, and the referee actually walks across and says to god I look I've already given one penalty against you for wrestling down harry kane
[3792.78 - 3797.66] P:1666.81 E:0.266901 |  Don't do it. I'll give a penalty. He's doing it. He's standing right next to him with his arms out wide
[3798.86 - 3803.58] P:1511.44 E:0.279388 |  And and kane is standing in front of him and now god I as the bulls played in from the corner
[3804.70 - 3809.58] P:1649.78 E:0.255641 |  And it's cleared away by panamart just outside of their own penalty area. He did
[3809.98 - 3816.46] P:1639.72 E:0.230318 |  Yeah, he did slightly changes approach god I that slightly. Yeah, you only had one on one on this time
[3816.70 - 3818.70] P:1829.30 E:0.187316 |  Well, he is he's
[3819.66 - 3823.50] P:1511.15 E:0.289001 |  The referee keeps giving them and that's the rules gives them. It's the only way you learn
[3825.26 - 3828.70] P:1554.62 E:0.209345 |  Yep, totally agree walk up playing the ball
[3829.98 - 3833.02] P:1592.35 E:0.232975 |  To young and then back to stones
[3833.50 - 3835.18] P:1568.18 E:0.247352 |  And I mentioned walk up
[3835.18 - 3837.34] P:1443.47 E:0.270787 |  There was a bit of walking football there from england
[3837.82 - 3843.26] P:1603.96 E:0.262546 |  And I think that might be the order of the day in the second half for large parts with the the win the points
[3843.58 - 3848.70] P:1655.75 E:0.238996 |  The qualification for the last 16 already secure for garrus south gates team
[3850.14 - 3855.58] P:1628.59 E:0.261328 |  And as we've mentioned the issue of goal difference obviously comes into this now
[3856.46 - 3858.46] P:1641.05 E:0.250519 |  with belgium
[3859.10 - 3862.54] P:1611.44 E:0.273007 |  Having a goal difference coming into this match of plus six
[3863.26 - 3866.78] P:1525.83 E:0.257084 |  england now also have a goal difference of plus six
[3867.98 - 3872.46] P:1528.36 E:0.281264 |  Ball played for trippie add on the right, but he won't reach that and advances through into the advertising hoardings
[3873.26 - 3877.98] P:1591.97 E:0.272482 |  It's hard for england to get the tempo back up and simply because it's too easy for them
[3878.70 - 3883.50] P:1457.51 E:0.271029 |  It's so easy at the minute they can do what they want with the ball and it's become a little bit slow
[3885.66 - 3891.02] P:1646.33 E:0.245434 |  And so panado has this goal kick from down to our right
[3892.38 - 3896.94] P:1560.93 E:0.263418 |  Deep into the england half where it's headed forward by kyle walker bounces back though and
[3897.34 - 3900.62] P:1741.31 E:0.271692 |  Will be taken on through the middle by kupa kupa
[3901.18 - 3907.66] P:1651.63 E:0.287334 |  Now back to the right hand side where godoy thought about the ball into the penalty area instead turns and gives it out to the right hand side to
[3908.30 - 3909.34] P:1806.56 E:0.276798 |  mario
[3909.34 - 3915.58] P:1571.38 E:0.278104 |  Who plays in america as a number of these panamar players do mario plays for new york red bulls in the mls
[3915.98 - 3920.94] P:1554.64 E:0.278569 |  Here they come panamar again with a deep cross trippie gets his head to it at the back post and then a follow-up header
[3921.18 - 3926.78] P:1555.63 E:0.243886 |  From the england right wing back to nod it out of play for a throwing the davis the number 15
[3927.02 - 3932.86] P:1549.71 E:0.271088 |  Arrived to take level with the edge of the england penalty area five live england leading panamar

[3939.10 - 3941.98] P:1592.95 E:0.254757 |  taken short by davis and then
[3942.54 - 3947.42] P:1421.70 E:0.264987 |  rodriguez is all over the back of trippie and it's a free kick to england and now right back position
[3947.58 - 3954.14] P:1450.22 E:0.294699 |  Now face of the game is completely gone as an as it's a warm down in england have won the game quite comfortably in the first half
[3954.14 - 3957.66] P:1581.67 E:0.278815 |  So it's just a matter of playing it out don't get injuries. No silly bookings
[3958.86 - 3961.42] P:1428.06 E:0.253787 |  If you get your chance obviously take it but
[3963.26 - 3965.26] P:1551.17 E:0.278686 |  If you're out and about back home on this
[3965.82 - 3968.06] P:1429.69 E:0.314424 |  Sunday afternoon, which may well be sunny where you are
[3968.78 - 3971.82] P:1407.76 E:0.279985 |  Can't be hotter than it is here in nisney, nove garrad
[3972.06 - 3974.78] P:1569.51 E:0.291160 |  But the match is on bbc one when you get back in

[3980.46 - 3982.46] P:1754.24 E:0.286152 |  Ball played forward for sterling to chase
[3982.86 - 3986.94] P:1542.10 E:0.277011 |  He's up against eskibar, but a little tug by sterling or was that the offside?
[3987.02 - 3990.94] P:1498.74 E:0.258109 |  No, just a little tug. I think was good to his quick eskibar. Oh, you run sterling it
[3991.02 - 3994.46] P:1370.82 E:0.263193 |  Well, he's the quicker one of the two of the central defenders the panamar
[3995.02 - 4000.94] P:1450.68 E:0.267840 |  Reporters that I was speaking to yesterday pointed to eskibar and torres who are the the two central defenders
[4001.42 - 4009.74] P:1536.62 E:0.272679 |  As I've said roman torres is extremely well built and they said to me eskibar. He's quick torres not so quick
[4010.70 - 4015.42] P:1649.82 E:0.309977 |  England putting the ball back with lofters cheek just inside the panamar half
[4015.90 - 4018.06] P:1746.77 E:0.315280 |  lofters cheek just drifts away from
[4018.70 - 4022.30] P:1678.17 E:0.308141 |  Godoy now harry kane sentry plays it out to the right hand side
[4023.26 - 4029.50] P:1636.32 E:0.297498 |  Come back from an offside position. That was a little kill and tebilla rolls the ball away with his foot
[4029.98 - 4034.54] P:1654.32 E:0.263543 |  You do not want to pick up the cheap yellow card for that in these circumstances
[4034.86 - 4038.46] P:1453.30 E:0.264890 |  Free kick that panamar will take
[4039.26 - 4041.26] P:1621.27 E:0.285792 |  through fidel eskibar
[4041.90 - 4043.90] P:1525.89 E:0.261981 |  a great disappointment this
[4044.06 - 4046.06] P:1459.31 E:0.298902 |  Obviously, it means that panamar will be out
[4046.46 - 4052.94] P:1537.66 E:0.278749 |  As our tunisia already with a scoreline like this with belgium and england taking maximum points from their first two matches
[4053.66 - 4056.86] P:1599.39 E:0.259163 |  But the final match in the group between panamar and tunisia
[4057.18 - 4062.94] P:1604.45 E:0.274415 |  You know that will be a cause of great pride for these two sides that we've seen already at this world cup tunisia having
[4063.26 - 4068.46] P:1562.31 E:0.272583 |  Not played at the world cup for for some while panamar involved in their very first world cup
[4068.78 - 4071.58] P:1500.71 E:0.278609 |  I'm sure the target there will be to get the wins scores and goals
[4072.14 - 4076.54] P:1386.94 E:0.290491 |  But they will be heading home after the knockout stage whereas england will be heading through to the last 16
[4077.10 - 4081.66] P:1476.62 E:0.285577 |  Depending on what happens in that game against belgium in kaliningrad
[4081.98 - 4087.50] P:1493.97 E:0.286550 |  Which is on thursday by the way seven o'clock uk time back to an evening kickoff for england on thursday night
[4087.50 - 4094.54] P:1592.22 E:0.259018 |  You will be able to hear it here with us on bbc radio five live from way out to the west of russia the most
[4094.62 - 4099.02] P:1443.56 E:0.244480 |  Westerly venue england in possession inside the panamar half with maguire
[4099.26 - 4104.38] P:1595.94 E:0.265789 |  It'll ball forward towards sterling the challenge comes in from mario and then sterling concedes a free kick
[4105.34 - 4109.66] P:1573.90 E:0.284687 |  garris southgate's shown faith with raheem sterling and although he has been involved
[4110.14 - 4114.70] P:1429.89 E:0.261883 |  In some of the goals, I would say his overall play it. It hasn't really happened for you know
[4115.42 - 4120.22] P:1600.82 E:0.286114 |  I'd say not as well. Yes, he's had a little bit of moments link up with lindgard fire lindgard's great goal
[4120.22 - 4125.90] P:1611.87 E:0.263778 |  But um the odd bit i mean we're talking a little bit here and um, yeah, it hasn't happened again from me
[4126.06 - 4131.42] P:1599.55 E:0.297143 |  And now it's the easiest thing in the world really in these circumstances for garris southgate to say to him
[4131.42 - 4133.42] P:1578.36 E:0.261528 |  Right, I am going to make changes
[4133.42 - 4137.90] P:1735.83 E:0.292185 |  For the the match against belgium and you would expect that rashford for sterling would be one of them
[4138.14 - 4143.50] P:1589.09 E:0.288111 |  We will perhaps see rashford, of course before the end of this game as mario crosses into the edge of the england penalty area
[4143.50 - 4147.74] P:1631.68 E:0.277582 |  But it's cleared away. Actually, it's panamah who are going to make the first change as they win a free kick
[4147.74 - 4153.42] P:1495.55 E:0.269869 |  But they take it quickly so it won't happen just yet mario gives it to bar senes on the right hand side bar senes plays the
[4153.42 - 4155.26] P:1283.29 E:0.267979 |  infield godoy is there

[4168.46 - 4170.06] P:1412.09 E:0.231184 |  But he's just turned 20
[4170.06 - 4173.66] P:1326.19 E:0.280524 |  Jose luisa rodriguez now plays it back towards the center circle
[4174.06 - 4176.78] P:1292.97 E:0.288531 |  Chipped by eskibar out to mario on the right hand side
[4176.86 - 4179.66] P:1136.24 E:0.303843 |  england are just allowing panamah to have possession inside their half
[4180.06 - 4185.42] P:1654.77 E:0.303670 |  Now eventually they move it further forward towards the edge of the box godoy with a touch godoy and pares
[4185.74 - 4191.26] P:1541.27 E:0.291862 |  Run into one another but pares plays it out to the right hand side to mario. Here's the cross but it's in to be the backside
[4191.82 - 4192.86] P:1636.69 E:0.245211 |  of uh
[4192.86 - 4197.02] P:1460.83 E:0.285729 |  Of henderson who'd come across and panamah have to go all the way back into their own half
[4197.26 - 4199.90] P:1705.80 E:0.290601 |  They are still waiting to bring on ricardo avia
[4200.46 - 4205.02] P:1696.82 E:0.276680 |  But england have won the ball back and england now have options as it's played
[4205.58 - 4211.10] P:1557.39 E:0.286839 |  Out to the right hand side to lofters cheek rather labored step over from lofters cheek and john stones who brought the ball out
[4211.42 - 4214.22] P:1536.58 E:0.266000 |  Just prods it back into his own half
[4214.70 - 4220.70] P:1501.62 E:0.296179 |  Looks like according to rachel burton who's down behind the the goal in front of many of the england supporters in the stand
[4221.26 - 4227.50] P:1467.59 E:0.272027 |  It looks like delf and vadi might be getting their opportunity to come on to the pitch and actually just as i say that i see them
[4227.58 - 4228.94] P:1704.95 E:0.238131 |  both emerge from
[4228.94 - 4235.26] P:1519.51 E:0.290903 |  Underneath the roof of the england dugout. So this will be a first appearance at the at the world cup for both jamie vadi and

[4237.34 - 4242.22] P:1522.69 E:0.288789 |  england five panamah nil is the score the scorers john stones with two
[4242.62 - 4247.90] P:1559.94 E:0.296474 |  harry came with two penalties which means he's the joint leading scorer at this world cup now with rinaldo and lucacu
[4248.30 - 4250.30] P:1532.34 E:0.274769 |  And lingard with the pick of the goals
[4250.94 - 4254.78] P:1671.44 E:0.285866 |  Here is lofters cheek. He's on his left foot. He shoots. Oh, it's deflected in
[4255.74 - 4257.74] P:1848.90 E:0.312916 |  it hit harry kane
[4258.22 - 4261.10] P:1834.51 E:0.311372 |  And it's deflected past a helpless
[4261.74 - 4267.90] P:1778.07 E:0.303732 |  Jaime panado into the back of the panamah net and it is six nil the question is
[4268.14 - 4273.90] P:1721.52 E:0.282802 |  Is that harry kane's hat trick or is it a first goal for england for rooven lofters cheek?
[4274.38 - 4276.38] P:1441.63 E:0.286188 |  Well, i'm gonna go harry kane
[4277.18 - 4280.14] P:1664.84 E:0.285312 |  Hat trick as he hits it he's offside by the way if it is is
[4281.10 - 4287.18] P:1541.90 E:0.275405 |  And actually they are checking it he's offside. We've got the signal. They are checking for offside in the build up to the goal
[4287.98 - 4289.18] P:1635.53 E:0.224942 |  so
[4289.18 - 4293.34] P:1608.84 E:0.258490 |  I think that is going to be ruled out he's offside
[4294.70 - 4296.70] P:1537.90 E:0.252149 |  They're going to make the change
[4296.70 - 4302.14] P:1392.98 E:0.282610 |  Meanwhile as we wait for the decision to be made the players are coming back to the halfway line to get into position for kickoff
[4302.62 - 4310.14] P:1583.11 E:0.252010 |  But we've not yet got the decision and godoy is coming off for panamah
[4311.34 - 4313.34] P:1494.06 E:0.283159 |  To be replaced by avia
[4314.38 - 4316.38] P:1604.12 E:0.276454 |  And the check is over
[4318.54 - 4321.10] P:1576.05 E:0.341763 |  And he does look offside on the pictures we have
[4322.38 - 4329.82] P:1736.20 E:0.309140 |  And going off now we're trying to go off scoiaz to walk off. Wow. So has the goal been given? Yeah. Yeah, the goal has been given
[4332.22 - 4339.50] P:1640.17 E:0.279493 |  And it is harry kane's goal and he becomes only the third man to score a hat trick for england at a world cup finals
[4339.66 - 4344.54] P:1573.23 E:0.267430 |  Tournament and he is now the leading scorer at this tournament with five
[4345.10 - 4347.10] P:1536.16 E:0.297525 |  He didn't know much about the third one
[4347.50 - 4350.46] P:1449.81 E:0.267395 |  But he is accepting it very gratefully
[4350.94 - 4357.18] P:1486.56 E:0.276856 |  And he has been substituted having recorded the hat trick and england lead panamah by six goals to nil
[4357.98 - 4359.98] P:1658.58 E:0.251136 |  Then god off for delf
[4363.10 - 4365.10] P:1825.52 E:0.288779 |  Panamah have brought on
[4366.14 - 4370.14] P:1655.83 E:0.291092 |  Ricardo avia the 21 year old who plays his football
[4371.34 - 4374.14] P:1622.35 E:0.270604 |  In belgium with gent the number 19
[4374.78 - 4376.78] P:1550.85 E:0.288100 |  And england have made the two changes
[4377.10 - 4383.82] P:1569.92 E:0.266052 |  So vaadi and delf are on for their first taste of action at a world cup and they've taken the places of kane
[4384.54 - 4386.54] P:1385.11 E:0.297399 |  And jesse lingard as well
[4386.86 - 4390.14] P:1245.02 E:0.304675 |  Is is being taken off by england so vaadi
[4390.86 - 4392.86] P:1361.93 E:0.251141 |  And delft are into the action
[4393.50 - 4397.02] P:1387.92 E:0.291053 |  Carlos southgate has one more possible change that he can make but it is now
[4398.54 - 4401.50] P:1248.99 E:0.276044 |  A record scoreline of six nil for england
[4402.30 - 4403.50] P:1361.71 E:0.243610 |  their biggest
[4403.50 - 4408.70] P:1412.26 E:0.326237 |  Margin of victory their biggest win ever at a world cup finals as the balls played back by eskibar to panado
[4408.78 - 4412.14] P:1535.27 E:0.316329 |  Who mis-controlled it on the edge of the area sterling is still there putting him under pressure
[4412.30 - 4415.50] P:1324.19 E:0.270062 |  And as a result he was able to catch up with the ball and chip it out of play on the far side
[4416.14 - 4421.26] P:1454.83 E:0.295223 |  I've got to say I'm certain of the way england has scored some great goal and set pieces a lot they've done their job

[4444.46 - 4449.90] P:1202.75 E:0.249199 |  I mean we were talking about putting better teams than panamah away, but they have put them away
[4451.90 - 4453.66] P:1520.59 E:0.275114 |  But at times you feel
[4453.66 - 4455.66] P:1397.48 E:0.294625 |  They almost couldn't have failed to put them away
[4456.14 - 4460.22] P:1352.29 E:0.295315 |  Henderson to lofty's cheek on the right hand side lofty's cheek now back to jordan henderson
[4460.38 - 4463.34] P:1316.64 E:0.274745 |  Then jordan henderson plays a square ball behind everyone in a white shirt
[4463.90 - 4469.10] P:1474.91 E:0.295986 |  Jordan henderson this would be a great opportunity for henderson if he can to get his first goal for england. It's been a long time coming
[4470.06 - 4474.54] P:1369.11 E:0.272059 |  Go back with mario though as panamah pass it out from the back, which they do up towards coupa

[4493.02 - 4495.66] P:1599.01 E:0.277141 |  But six nil with still 25 minutes to play
[4496.22 - 4499.50] P:1631.44 E:0.258551 |  We've got the list of um world cup record scores

[4502.06 - 4504.62] P:1313.03 E:0.282337 |  Seven nil would get england into the top ten
[4505.82 - 4508.94] P:1442.64 E:0.287614 |  Here's mario on the right hand side. It is six nil at the moment
[4510.38 - 4517.26] P:1751.36 E:0.323690 |  Now god oi plays it through mario could be in here chips pickford and it's blocked inside the six yard box by a combination
[4517.50 - 4521.90] P:1518.15 E:0.295108 |  Of walkout and stones and they volley it out of play on the first time it plays stay down mariella

[4526.70 - 4530.38] P:1345.13 E:0.297599 |  That's not the play let them run in behind look nobody goes in as through ball
[4530.94 - 4533.66] P:1681.87 E:0.262697 |  He's trying to lift it over pickford. He gets slight hand to it
[4534.46 - 4536.46] P:1679.37 E:0.253389 |  and england clear the lanes
[4537.58 - 4540.30] P:1519.02 E:0.290967 |  Uh checking for possible penalty
[4541.26 - 4545.10] P:1515.11 E:0.300330 |  I presume that's the way that pickford came out there the check is over
[4546.06 - 4548.06] P:1547.56 E:0.308331 |  The referee has a look over his shoulder
[4549.02 - 4553.42] P:1565.83 E:0.277253 |  But that's only because england are going to make their next change and actually danie rose is going to come on
[4553.42 - 4558.38] P:1584.25 E:0.276408 |  So we're not going to see marcus rashford today in these circumstances. I think that's wise don't you chris?
[4558.86 - 4564.38] P:1598.51 E:0.270862 |  To now with six nil up to keep rashford. Maybe already said to rashford on the bench down there
[4564.46 - 4567.74] P:1355.57 E:0.281476 |  Maybe already said to him before this game. I'm planning to start you against belgium
[4569.74 - 4572.22] P:1402.08 E:0.320458 |  So six nil to england bbc radio five live

[4586.46 - 4590.70] P:1464.84 E:0.270887 |  And uh, we'll get an england score for you when we get a chance from old trafford
[4592.54 - 4594.30] P:1594.12 E:0.240924 |  Panamara are going to make
[4594.30 - 4597.66] P:1509.91 E:0.311882 |  Their next two changes as well. So it looks as though we'll see danie rose coming on
[4598.38 - 4600.46] P:1374.09 E:0.289680 |  And also a couple of panamanian players too
[4601.26 - 4603.26] P:1481.43 E:0.276694 |  It's a six nil
[4603.26 - 4605.66] P:1532.32 E:0.306805 |  With just the one further goal in the second half
[4606.38 - 4609.98] P:1620.71 E:0.296495 |  Just have a feeling that they might look at that again
[4610.62 - 4612.62] P:1741.06 E:0.283120 |  Oh england are 50 for five
[4613.42 - 4615.42] P:1536.15 E:0.273937 |  chasing 206 to win
[4616.30 - 4621.82] P:1688.86 E:0.283467 |  So uh 50 for five. I'm not sure how many overs that is but i'm not sure that's going to be a factor
[4622.46 - 4624.46] P:1458.63 E:0.272877 |  So uh six nil
[4626.06 - 4628.06] P:1538.38 E:0.266267 |  Just being told how many overs
[4628.22 - 4630.22] P:1685.83 E:0.217777 |  14 overs
[4630.30 - 4632.30] P:1562.61 E:0.269866 |  50 for five after 14 overs
[4632.46 - 4639.98] P:1527.33 E:0.277581 |  Mario plays the ball back into his own half the sun comes out brightly again on what is now late afternoon here in nizhny Novgorod
[4640.54 - 4645.26] P:1735.19 E:0.238705 |  As davis plays it in field to kupa kupa finds
[4645.50 - 4650.22] P:1481.39 E:0.278590 |  Fabian delph in front of him so turns and plays it back into his own half to the burly
[4651.26 - 4652.70] P:1681.14 E:0.255644 |  brawny figure
[4652.70 - 4658.86] P:1468.88 E:0.286580 |  Of roman torres the captain of panamara. I think there'll be uh repercussions for panamara after this match
[4659.82 - 4665.74] P:1516.53 E:0.281348 |  In terms of the what happened at halftime the players gathering together before they went off the field the fact that they're six nil down
[4666.22 - 4670.62] P:1621.17 E:0.262858 |  But they've just been outplayed england have played around them here the substitute
[4671.18 - 4673.18] P:1527.56 E:0.243535 |  Avila
[4673.58 - 4675.58] P:1659.41 E:0.252937 |  On the halfway line
[4675.58 - 4677.58] P:1478.84 E:0.295195 |  Plays it in field towards mario
[4677.82 - 4682.06] P:1397.91 E:0.283141 |  And of course with that six goal now that means that england's goal difference is better than belgium's
[4682.22 - 4684.22] P:1515.68 E:0.265670 |  So currently if it stays like this
[4684.54 - 4690.62] P:1540.79 E:0.242487 |  England will be top of the group and a draw would mean against belgium would mean that england will top the group
[4690.70 - 4692.70] P:1714.74 E:0.231479 |  I think that's what belgium won, isn't it?
[4693.10 - 4694.22] P:1703.17 E:0.211582 |  well
[4694.22 - 4698.86] P:1436.44 E:0.278344 |  That is well, that's what reverter martin is says that he wants. I used to just being out of hand
[4702.62 - 4705.98] P:1706.39 E:0.269881 |  Right first change is made and it is going to be
[4707.58 - 4710.54] P:1472.16 E:0.284744 |  barsenas who is replaced
[4711.82 - 4713.26] P:1352.95 E:0.272435 |  and uh
[4713.34 - 4718.14] P:1404.09 E:0.277542 |  Also coming off now is gabriel gomez. So this might be his final moment
[4718.70 - 4722.38] P:1437.43 E:0.290030 |  Because the expectation is that he will retire from international football
[4722.78 - 4728.62] P:1396.82 E:0.289065 |  After this world cup this is his 144th cap and he's applauded off for the great service that he's given the team
[4728.94 - 4733.58] P:1538.87 E:0.292099 |  handshake from urn and darriel gomez the coach as well as uh gabriel gomez
[4734.30 - 4737.42] P:1585.35 E:0.299860 |  Takes a seat and he's replaced by felipe baloy
[4738.22 - 4741.34] P:1444.33 E:0.301655 |  Who plays for municipal in guatemala?
[4742.30 - 4748.86] P:1635.62 E:0.300360 |  And uh he is under the field. Strange england substitution. trippie is coming off and ashton's gone to right wing back
[4749.02 - 4751.02] P:1302.38 E:0.322018 |  Yeah, well he can play there. We know that very well
[4752.70 - 4760.54] P:1563.17 E:0.301044 |  So obviously we know though chris that kyrion trippie is very highly valued by gareth southgate as a member of this england team
[4760.54 - 4763.98] P:1278.12 E:0.290621 |  So he's taking no chances with trippie. It doesn't want anything to happen to him
[4765.42 - 4770.30] P:1590.36 E:0.277956 |  So as a result, danny rose is under the field and will be able to show gareth southgate what he can do
[4770.78 - 4773.42] P:1456.58 E:0.296734 |  In an attacking sense as an attacking fullback
[4774.06 - 4779.02] P:1379.72 E:0.301942 |  He's winning his 19th cap here and he too is playing his first match for england at the world cup finals
[4779.50 - 4784.06] P:1346.57 E:0.292183 |  so england leading panamarr by six goes to nil bbc radio five live and
[4784.62 - 4790.54] P:1449.80 E:0.269448 |  That's it in terms of the changes that gareth southgate can make and as chris waddle said ashley youngest come across to play
[4790.86 - 4792.86] P:1315.31 E:0.257816 |  as the right wing back
[4793.34 - 4795.34] P:1489.22 E:0.284758 |  england in possession
[4795.74 - 4797.74] P:1261.19 E:0.288931 |  inside panamarr territory
[4797.98 - 4802.38] P:1448.44 E:0.302806 |  Although harry maguire just runs it back into his own half and gives it to john stones
[4803.10 - 4805.10] P:1393.43 E:0.252054 |  and stones gets it back
[4805.34 - 4806.54] P:1570.03 E:0.245128 |  from
[4806.54 - 4807.82] P:1536.39 E:0.195185 |  walker
[4807.82 - 4811.10] P:1576.81 E:0.274014 |  Just have a feeling they'll look at that harry cayne hat trick goal again, you know
[4811.98 - 4814.30] P:1650.19 E:0.293983 |  Just to wear a pass by lofters cheek
[4815.10 - 4817.10] P:1478.08 E:0.314846 |  So walker has to run back into his own half
[4817.90 - 4823.66] P:1561.49 E:0.293772 |  Because if the shot if the shot from walker was from lofters cheek was on target if it was on target
[4823.66 - 4828.94] P:1587.40 E:0.256765 |  Which I have a feeling it was that would be lofters cheeks goal certainly in terms of premier league judgment
[4831.26 - 4835.50] P:1419.82 E:0.254816 |  Walker plays the ball across the back line to maguire and now
[4837.50 - 4839.82] P:1534.75 E:0.263601 |  The ball is given back by rose
[4840.62 - 4844.54] P:1358.03 E:0.272856 |  To henderson we've missed a very obvious line. I'm just thinking by the way
[4845.18 - 4847.18] P:1460.78 E:0.300039 |  If it is a hat trick
[4848.06 - 4852.38] P:1552.63 E:0.305372 |  Come on young playing it into the edge of the area comes off torres and now
[4853.34 - 4859.90] P:1493.57 E:0.273363 |  The ball runs away and it's played away by godoy who's able to clear it towards the halfway line
[4861.26 - 4863.26] P:1584.38 E:0.275947 |  as uh
[4864.06 - 4865.18] P:1724.47 E:0.270453 |  Cooper
[4865.18 - 4869.02] P:1436.79 E:0.296428 |  rolls it into the center to central defender eskibar and now
[4869.42 - 4872.22] P:1564.42 E:0.313873 |  Murillo takes a heavy touch and he's going to be dispossessed by sterling
[4872.22 - 4874.78] P:1529.06 E:0.296623 |  He is on then he hacks down sterling who is away from him
[4874.94 - 4880.14] P:1484.62 E:0.276087 |  That's going to be a yellow card and it's a chance for another set piece to be delivered into the panamarr penalty area
[4880.38 - 4883.66] P:1530.65 E:0.261769 |  Yep another card once in this in the next game as well
[4885.82 - 4887.82] P:1546.11 E:0.296230 |  If that is a hat trick for harry kane
[4888.30 - 4893.50] P:1512.60 E:0.296764 |  It is of course for harry kane a panamarr and you were going to say that that's why I didn't want to say it
[4894.78 - 4897.58] P:1558.53 E:0.269295 |  Because I thought about it and I thought I'm not going to say that
[4898.38 - 4901.98] P:1543.63 E:0.274338 |  We all say some bad ones don't we but I'm not I'm turning my back on you
[4903.34 - 4908.14] P:1330.60 E:0.273172 |  Right free kick young is going to take this in it's not harry kane on the field anymore
[4908.14 - 4913.58] P:1476.34 E:0.238542 |  So who's the target's going to be or our panamarr going to to play it cleanly
[4916.38 - 4918.38] P:1660.73 E:0.283984 |  One man wall
[4918.38 - 4922.86] P:1504.62 E:0.291168 |  Young waiting to take this we've got a mexican wave starting up or is that a panamanian way?
[4924.30 - 4926.30] P:1476.22 E:0.305122 |  young
[4931.50 - 4934.06] P:1330.11 E:0.327970 |  Holding their line on the edge of the penalty area
[4934.54 - 4938.54] P:1647.83 E:0.284298 |  Young flakes the ball in towards the back post maguire heads it back across
[4938.62 - 4941.26] P:1720.19 E:0.289219 |  There's a little touch from the head and then it's back to henderson
[4941.66 - 4945.58] P:1535.47 E:0.311311 |  Who sends his volley wide at the top corner? I thought he was on for his first goal
[4945.58 - 4948.46] P:1346.01 E:0.265593 |  Yeah, so did I put technique as well. He's not happy
[4949.66 - 4952.14] P:1533.83 E:0.309209 |  He's actually thought that was going in another set piece
[4952.78 - 4957.50] P:1568.06 E:0.290208 |  Maguire so strong in the air comes out and he gets his great technique by him just kind of the target
[4958.46 - 4964.54] P:1592.22 E:0.282285 |  Hey, never jimmy vardy actually headed it back to to henderson who was looking to they were almost a mark hugh style
[4965.26 - 4967.90] P:1549.86 E:0.264573 |  volley from the edge of the area, but he pulled it just right
[4969.50 - 4973.98] P:1552.44 E:0.293065 |  So on this beautiful afternoon absolutely gorgeous afternoon here in this part of russia we're actually
[4974.62 - 4976.62] P:1810.19 E:0.288968 |  About four hours
[4976.70 - 4981.10] P:1681.28 E:0.303942 |  on the train to the east of of moscow will be going back there tomorrow
[4981.74 - 4983.74] P:1765.31 E:0.281746 |  and uh russia
[4983.98 - 4986.86] P:1611.89 E:0.320398 |  Russia and yes the the song that is being sung
[4987.42 - 4993.50] P:1524.26 E:0.299768 |  In the stadium here by the locals and they are waving the flags of russia all around the place and lifting them high
[4995.42 - 5000.22] P:1591.60 E:0.290273 |  So a little bit of a local flavor from our friends in nijny Novgorod
[5001.26 - 5004.30] P:1349.08 E:0.303051 |  Beautiful afternoon as I said it's at the confluence of these two rivers
[5004.30 - 5005.82] P:1001.54 E:0.264198 |  There are loads of little islands
[5005.82 - 5011.42] P:1400.72 E:0.266717 |  We took the cable car didn't we over the vulgar yesterday and as we did so and actually for a few minutes
[5011.90 - 5017.82] P:1310.29 E:0.262959 |  Rather disconcertingly it came to a stop and it was very quiet as we hung
[5018.94 - 5023.50] P:1396.96 E:0.293323 |  About a hundred feet above the vulgar river and it all we could only hear the wind
[5023.98 - 5026.78] P:1274.28 E:0.278227 |  It's a little like being in where eagles dare wasn't it?
[5027.66 - 5030.38] P:1283.80 E:0.292043 |  And we wondered whether we might be still there now, but
[5030.86 - 5032.86] P:1484.21 E:0.258520 |  Fortunately it got moving again
[5032.94 - 5035.42] P:1510.39 E:0.290587 |  So we'd had mark shatman with us in there can you imagine?
[5036.14 - 5041.34] P:1558.73 E:0.309806 |  Mark time stills looking very much so he has rose on the left hand side for england marievo wins it back
[5041.42 - 5045.82] P:1647.56 E:0.307453 |  From here's a ball over the top pickfords come a long ways chested it down on the edge of the panlea in his day
[5045.82 - 5051.66] P:1585.61 E:0.249322 |  We'll just stab it out towards the right hand side here where kyle walker will give it to the now right wing back
[5052.14 - 5053.74] P:1547.75 E:0.206386 |  ashley young

[5056.14 - 5059.34] P:1579.53 E:0.284336 |  england were five nil up at halftime. They're on the way to a record score
[5059.34 - 5064.54] P:1640.23 E:0.247201 |  They're on the way to topping the group going into that final match with belgium and uh
[5065.58 - 5070.62] P:1527.60 E:0.278980 |  I'm sure garris southgate will have to answer the question about how many changes he's going to make for the belgium game
[5070.62 - 5074.70] P:1392.52 E:0.274122 |  Particularly given what reberto martinez said about his intentions yesterday
[5075.50 - 5081.18] P:1666.03 E:0.310718 |  However, we will bring you um those interviews with garris southgate and the england players during the course of 606
[5081.50 - 5084.70] P:1651.17 E:0.306188 |  The lines are open for that but panamar on the move down the left hand side
[5085.18 - 5090.62] P:1650.58 E:0.299824 |  That's what they want. They want to see their team score a goal rodriguez whips it across and actually daniel rose
[5091.10 - 5094.78] P:1583.85 E:0.286194 |  Nick's contact with it. It hits the corner flag and it goes out for a corner to panamar
[5094.86 - 5099.10] P:1633.61 E:0.286992 |  I do not look threatening in any set piece of thought up in england doing very well, but uh
[5099.74 - 5105.18] P:1576.84 E:0.311075 |  There's a good race that down that left hand side wasn't it there rodriguez given caro a good run for his money
[5107.18 - 5110.30] P:1720.23 E:0.318495 |  The attendance 43 319
[5110.94 - 5112.62] P:1538.07 E:0.269093 |  inside this
[5112.62 - 5118.46] P:1674.08 E:0.309949 |  Very attractive. It's actually possibly the most attractive stadium that we've been to yet corner for panamar in towards the near post
[5118.54 - 5119.58] P:1816.05 E:0.347379 |  The glanche across
[5119.58 - 5121.58] P:1676.55 E:0.325296 |  And chares at the chance at the back post
[5121.90 - 5128.54] P:1700.64 E:0.324366 |  Roman chares of all people the man who scored the famous goal could have scored an almost even more famous goal
[5129.10 - 5131.90] P:1664.71 E:0.303121 |  They're first at the world cup finals, but he slid it wide
[5131.98 - 5136.70] P:1521.58 E:0.270494 |  Well, you gotta say jordan Anderson lets the first man get in front and harry mcguire switches off at the far post
[5137.34 - 5139.34] P:1716.69 E:0.202745 |  And he should have scored
[5141.66 - 5143.66] P:1716.22 E:0.294184 |  He got the goal against costa rica
[5144.14 - 5148.94] P:1641.28 E:0.263389 |  That helped clinch qualification when they beat costa rica panamar and made it to russia
[5149.74 - 5154.86] P:1539.91 E:0.276904 |  If he'd scored the first one and four them at the world cup finals despite the score line of six nil at the moment
[5155.34 - 5160.14] P:1454.02 E:0.278460 |  I mean, I don't know what that what they might do with him in terms of making a national hero, but
[5161.02 - 5164.62] P:1729.07 E:0.277740 |  But um, have you'd scored that one? Well, he's made for life
[5165.50 - 5167.50] P:1817.20 E:0.288037 |  However, he put it wide
[5169.34 - 5171.58] P:1797.39 E:0.273403 |  So it's still six nil
[5173.18 - 5175.18] P:1884.70 E:0.265727 |  And england
[5175.66 - 5180.62] P:1698.20 E:0.300724 |  With uh loftest cheek who runs into trouble and panamar looked to break away again
[5180.94 - 5183.98] P:1683.68 E:0.278316 |  To get the feeling now that they are going for this goal here
[5184.86 - 5186.94] P:1568.72 E:0.283583 |  That they're being beaten. They're going to be heavily beaten
[5187.42 - 5193.58] P:1657.01 E:0.289364 |  But whenever they get the ball they are heading directly towards the penalty area, which is what they're doing now with kupa
[5194.14 - 5199.82] P:1662.99 E:0.271669 |  And armando kupa is just checked by henderson and it's a free kick 15 yards inside the england half to panamar
[5200.70 - 5202.70] P:1762.23 E:0.265943 |  And here they go forward again
[5202.86 - 5210.06] P:1586.19 E:0.290833 |  He just had a great opportunity to score didn't it? I don't I don't I'm not gonna say but I don't think we get a better chance than what they just had
[5211.58 - 5214.46] P:1738.45 E:0.307001 |  A free kick it's going to be played in
[5215.66 - 5218.86] P:1721.99 E:0.288066 |  Left-footed from the uh substitute
[5221.42 - 5226.94] P:1656.72 E:0.358890 |  England holding the line outside the penalty area. Villar pays it in and it's in it's in they've scored one
[5228.14 - 5230.64] P:1797.56 E:0.376068 |  Well brilliant for them. It's Philippe Bouloy
[5231.74 - 5239.10] P:1788.81 E:0.341477 |  Who has scored panamar's first ever goal at a world cup finals? He scored it against england. It's six one
[5240.06 - 5246.54] P:1703.06 E:0.343843 |  And the panamar players and the supporters are celebrating as though they've won the world cup here in russia
[5247.98 - 5252.62] P:1695.67 E:0.327896 |  Well, I've got to say I don't know what the back lane of england. We're doing so. You know when you've got to play the ball you've got to drop
[5253.58 - 5258.38] P:1739.34 E:0.303142 |  It's a great ball in I've got a good credit one on the wall. He bends it around after you and it's
[5258.78 - 5263.34] P:1664.59 E:0.305223 |  There's three or four them. Nobody tracks. They all just put their hand up so he's offside
[5264.14 - 5266.54] P:1549.12 E:0.304421 |  Two come back with what four reds waiting to put it in
[5267.50 - 5269.50] P:1713.90 E:0.264875 |  Bad defendant by englander
[5270.78 - 5276.22] P:1683.70 E:0.291534 |  Stretch for it on his right foot and he caught it well enough and hit a low bouncing shot
[5276.70 - 5278.70] P:1557.52 E:0.281077 |  Passed jordan pickford's dive to his left
[5279.18 - 5284.14] P:1642.70 E:0.275562 |  It's the first goal england have conceded from open play at this world cup the penalty against tunisia
[5284.54 - 5289.90] P:1543.61 E:0.273916 |  And that one here and we now have a score line of england six panamar one
[5290.94 - 5294.22] P:1719.23 E:0.304430 |  And that means that uh england's goal difference is now back to

[5650.70 - 5651.82] P:1740.29 E:0.247793 |  baloi
[5651.82 - 5654.78] P:1546.56 E:0.283019 |  At the back baloi chips it out to the left hand side
[5655.26 - 5659.50] P:1638.67 E:0.278216 |  Where davis controls it. We've got just over five minutes to play the score
[5660.06 - 5662.06] P:1474.90 E:0.242627 |  england six panamar
[5662.38 - 5664.94] P:1342.74 E:0.245416 |  One no one has ever said that before
[5665.58 - 5669.90] P:1667.92 E:0.281737 |  And a bbc radio commentary when any commentary at a world cup finals
[5670.86 - 5672.86] P:1710.21 E:0.312179 |  Since half taking playing the cigars on
[5677.02 - 5679.02] P:1770.58 E:0.275439 |  And you said to me
[5679.66 - 5681.90] P:1802.29 E:0.280015 |  Pre-kick for panamar
[5682.62 - 5690.22] P:1715.33 E:0.273624 |  But avila will take and avila it was who played in the free kick from not too far away from this position
[5690.78 - 5692.78] P:1629.77 E:0.250051 |  Very similar when baloi
[5692.94 - 5697.42] P:1633.87 E:0.269270 |  Scored the panamar goal and here is avila looking to play it into the same position
[5697.42 - 5702.30] P:1540.71 E:0.247863 |  But this time walker gets up one challenge to head it away comes out to fidel eskibar
[5703.42 - 5705.42] P:1788.96 E:0.212508 |  now uh
[5705.42 - 5707.42] P:1761.62 E:0.245400 |  Backheeled by mario
[5707.42 - 5711.10] P:1616.94 E:0.256743 |  Torres it's popped up on the right wing now roman torres
[5712.38 - 5717.10] P:1342.77 E:0.290373 |  It's got a rather testimonial feel at the end of this game now after the celebrations for the panamar goal
[5717.66 - 5721.18] P:1519.48 E:0.254063 |  england cruising to victory as they have been really since
[5721.82 - 5726.94] P:1569.70 E:0.303345 |  Since they scored the second in all of this game. Yes, definitely. It's been such an easy game for them and um
[5727.42 - 5730.38] P:1654.67 E:0.278764 |  You know you've got to beat what's in front in that's what they've done
[5730.94 - 5735.18] P:1716.71 E:0.298984 |  Convincingly beat them second half to just come off the pace that managed the game they're saving their energy
[5735.98 - 5738.78] P:1589.19 E:0.263572 |  Disappointment is have conceded a goal which we didn't want them to
[5739.50 - 5741.50] P:1607.95 E:0.246718 |  Six one
[5742.22 - 5746.30] P:1635.91 E:0.309593 |  Time running out and henderson playing it for vadi vadi on the chase now
[5746.30 - 5751.42] P:1638.96 E:0.270579 |  He gets there first ahead of three panamanians there's no one in the middle eventually they do arrive sterling
[5752.06 - 5755.42] P:1512.18 E:0.269615 |  Vadi crosses delft as well to pull that down and then try to
[5756.06 - 5760.94] P:1338.10 E:0.265914 |  Set rows away on the left-hand side, but as he slid as he as he went down he overhitted
[5761.50 - 5766.38] P:1435.23 E:0.279959 |  Torres has got it back. That was your arm string probably until after pulling it down at full stretch
[5768.78 - 5773.50] P:1355.56 E:0.286891 |  You don't want to get injured the world cup in the final moments of a six one win against panaman
[5774.54 - 5776.54] P:1606.18 E:0.224437 |  davis
[5776.70 - 5781.02] P:1315.51 E:0.275934 |  Davis now for panaman that comes off the head of rodriquez
[5782.62 - 5785.74] P:1292.07 E:0.293404 |  Then back once again to davis near the halfway line
[5786.94 - 5788.30] P:1511.31 E:0.231603 |  just really
[5788.30 - 5794.38] P:1451.31 E:0.274039 |  Seeing this game out now if england happened to get another chance to score another one then all well and good, but
[5795.02 - 5797.02] P:1599.75 E:0.246289 |  I don't think they're going to bust a gut
[5798.78 - 5800.78] P:1581.62 E:0.270063 |  Escobar to avila
[5801.18 - 5807.10] P:1504.27 E:0.278706 |  Escobar continues to come forward but finds delft in front of him so turns and plays it back into the back line to ball
[5809.98 - 5811.98] P:1580.48 E:0.286676 |  Now davis receives possession
[5812.38 - 5817.50] P:1595.34 E:0.284760 |  And rodriquez little ball in field towards kupa kupa's ball over the top
[5817.98 - 5821.66] P:1616.73 E:0.288615 |  Blas Perez is on side left side of the box brings the ball down
[5822.38 - 5828.14] P:1691.77 E:0.259355 |  Forced out into the full back position by kyle walker peres and now davis is involved as well
[5829.34 - 5831.34] P:1795.53 E:0.234259 |  ashley young
[5832.62 - 5835.34] P:1504.02 E:0.287360 |  Chases after both him and rodriquez
[5835.74 - 5841.34] P:1542.43 E:0.264023 |  So panaman returned it towards the halfway line again with two and a half minutes of the 90 to play
[5842.06 - 5844.86] P:1467.50 E:0.290679 |  And then at a time but panaman are going to be going home
[5845.34 - 5849.42] P:1586.97 E:0.275247 |  After the group stage of their very first world cup, but what an effort really to get here
[5850.06 - 5852.86] P:1473.37 E:0.288685 |  Ahead of the united states and their final qualifying group
[5853.02 - 5857.18] P:1621.83 E:0.274839 |  Here's rodriquez rodriquez taking on walker and pick that is able to come out and
[5857.66 - 5859.82] P:1425.16 E:0.274987 |  And scoop it up along the dead ball line
[5859.90 - 5864.46] P:1468.31 E:0.279925 |  Yeah, it's been quite an effort when you think about it from panaman this country population of only
[5865.10 - 5867.98] P:1482.12 E:0.271717 |  3.8 million it is an isthmus
[5868.54 - 5873.02] P:1386.83 E:0.288108 |  As we've been discussing panaman a narrow strip of land with water on either side
[5873.10 - 5874.78] P:1307.59 E:0.257922 |  It has the famous canal
[5874.78 - 5880.06] P:1383.46 E:0.271089 |  But they've made their mark on world sport by making their way to a world cup finals and okay
[5880.06 - 5886.54] P:1280.84 E:0.269632 |  They lost 3-0 to belgium and they're losing 6-1 to england, but uh, you know, it's it's being here
[5887.26 - 5890.86] P:1238.86 E:0.293854 |  Exactly you've done they've done brilliant to get you but you've found out that
[5891.98 - 5894.62] P:1349.34 E:0.299328 |  You know the well out of the depth here where the play games were
[5895.10 - 5897.66] P:1613.67 E:0.285529 |  qualified from obviously they're in every game is close
[5898.46 - 5900.22] P:1538.64 E:0.275539 |  But this is a new level of control
[5900.22 - 5904.06] P:1492.57 E:0.295873 |  But what it's done as well is as we heard from gary stemple the former millwall
[5904.62 - 5905.58] P:1671.32 E:0.204674 |  community
[5905.58 - 5910.54] P:1580.12 E:0.278336 |  Officer who's played such a big part in developing panamanian football and coaching
[5910.94 - 5917.02] P:1656.92 E:0.292325 |  What this will do will look like the london olympics as the phrase went to inspire a generation because baseball
[5917.34 - 5919.98] P:1497.78 E:0.269485 |  Has has long been the sport in panaman
[5920.30 - 5926.62] P:1473.51 E:0.257506 |  But lots of young kids growing up in panaman watching their team play at the world cup finals might uh might be inspired
[5927.66 - 5931.18] P:1414.00 E:0.275021 |  Instead to turn to football. So who knows where it'll lead for panaman
[5932.38 - 5934.22] P:1478.59 E:0.246061 |  6-1 and
[5934.22 - 5937.42] P:1372.65 E:0.281194 |  What's that on the surface of the pitch one of the players
[5937.90 - 5942.14] P:1445.83 E:0.272113 |  Look just though you're pulling bits out of a sock and they're orange pieces
[5942.78 - 5947.18] P:1175.79 E:0.293516 |  They look like orange pieces of material and they're littered in the middle of the the panaman half
[5948.62 - 5953.90] P:1431.66 E:0.261510 |  It's a free kick to england out towards the left hand side that young is looking to take
[5955.02 - 5960.06] P:1519.47 E:0.286748 |  Just raises his right arm. So they swing it in right footed so it'll swing towards the goalkeeper
[5960.70 - 5962.70] P:1372.28 E:0.201894 |  Poneido
[5962.70 - 5967.50] P:1475.28 E:0.260829 |  The referee again is concerned and making his point about holding on the england players
[5967.66 - 5969.66] P:1722.28 E:0.181685 |  There's the whistle
[5971.58 - 5977.58] P:1623.11 E:0.267211 |  Ashley young plays it in a glancing header from Henderson took a deflection, but it ran through to Poneido the goalkeeper
[5977.98 - 5982.86] P:1666.63 E:0.272711 |  So we're in the 90th minute chris. Who who would you pick out for for england in this match?
[5982.86 - 5987.10] P:1577.35 E:0.265788 |  And we also obviously want to talk about lofters cheek who came in to the side and sterling as well
[5987.50 - 5988.38] P:1543.54 E:0.221672 |  um
[5988.38 - 5992.22] P:1533.36 E:0.269390 |  You know, it's it's hard to actually say who's played very very well
[5992.30 - 5995.50] P:1655.85 E:0.250670 |  I would think just an ingrid looked good till he went off for me
[5996.46 - 5998.78] P:1525.81 E:0.299280 |  The rest of the players have just done enough they've managed the game
[5998.78 - 6001.98] P:1574.60 E:0.257175 |  Well, it's definitely not as good as the performance the first time against in is here
[6002.46 - 6003.66] P:1524.09 E:0.280234 |  But it's called six goals
[6003.66 - 6006.46] P:1554.87 E:0.275622 |  Henderson takes a quick free kick up towards the edge of the penalty area
[6006.46 - 6008.14] P:1727.20 E:0.239637 |  It was the four minutes of added time
[6008.14 - 6010.14] P:1596.98 E:0.283490 |  Rose and sterling are involved rose with the cross
[6010.14 - 6015.26] P:1483.61 E:0.245157 |  But there's no one there in a white england shirt and davis is able to chest it down inside his box and volley it away
[6015.82 - 6017.82] P:1466.81 E:0.270431 |  and again on sterling and
[6018.06 - 6023.02] P:1620.81 E:0.271146 |  And also lofters cheek who started his first competitive match for england. I think lofters cheeks did okay
[6023.18 - 6025.58] P:1762.21 E:0.271782 |  I think i've seen play better. I think he's looked a
[6026.62 - 6030.14] P:1674.99 E:0.310101 |  Bit late but it seems he's not free in his movement attempt, but um
[6031.34 - 6035.42] P:1628.14 E:0.297192 |  He's cleared this very time say he's done a job. I wouldn't say he was old standard today. He's done a job
[6035.42 - 6037.42] P:1715.65 E:0.247881 |  But um sterling for me
[6037.58 - 6040.70] P:1699.04 E:0.292426 |  For a role he's playing still not in the game enough doesn't look like he's gonna score
[6040.86 - 6044.70] P:1660.21 E:0.272994 |  Didn't really look as he was going to set anything up neither. So and that's what you've been judged on
[6045.26 - 6049.58] P:1687.73 E:0.276127 |  That's chris waddle on five live and you can have your say on six or six very soon
[6049.66 - 6054.78] P:1484.16 E:0.269304 |  Oh eight eight five nine or nine six nine three with kelly kates and terry budger and chris sudden
[6055.02 - 6058.06] P:1522.11 E:0.287276 |  Who are back in red square in our studio there?
[6058.46 - 6060.70] P:1399.58 E:0.279289 |  So england six panama one
[6061.34 - 6065.66] P:1463.19 E:0.264599 |  And we are in added time at the end of this match and and as it is
[6066.22 - 6069.02] P:1374.21 E:0.276419 |  england and belgium's records are identical
[6069.66 - 6075.66] P:1461.95 E:0.264104 |  They will both have a goal difference of plus six. They've both scored eight goals. They've both conceded two goals
[6076.62 - 6080.70] P:1513.09 E:0.261882 |  So it'll come down to what happens in that match in kelin and grad to decide
[6081.42 - 6084.94] P:1516.63 E:0.305278 |  Who goes through as group winners and who goes through as group winners up?
[6085.66 - 6086.70] P:1512.51 E:0.231688 |  here
[6086.70 - 6088.70] P:1581.94 E:0.247156 |  ashley young four england
[6088.78 - 6091.74] P:1555.61 E:0.288197 |  And now loft is cheap just stretches for the ball on the halfway line
[6092.78 - 6093.90] P:1503.14 E:0.264768 |  Henderson
[6093.90 - 6100.78] P:1518.35 E:0.280077 |  Goes to pass out towards the left flank but mario got there ahead of danie rose rose though challenges and for the aerial ball
[6101.18 - 6105.26] P:1411.82 E:0.277999 |  And mario has deflected it out of play so rose takes a quick throw into sterling
[6105.26 - 6107.90] P:1434.84 E:0.260757 |  He's got no one near him sterling wants to go on a run here
[6108.46 - 6110.46] P:1361.49 E:0.263468 |  He's just got a via in front of him now
[6110.70 - 6117.66] P:1437.34 E:0.265518 |  So touches it back behind him to delt two minutes of added time to play before we're done here in nisioni novgorod loft is cheap
[6118.06 - 6119.34] P:1528.96 E:0.211975 |  loft is cheap
[6119.34 - 6121.34] P:1383.05 E:0.268900 |  Is challenged that
[6121.58 - 6126.54] P:1444.88 E:0.275315 |  Strong uses those strong shoulders of him to to keep possession and england go all the way back
[6126.94 - 6129.34] P:1508.79 E:0.259049 |  Towards pickfed so for england
[6129.42 - 6133.74] P:1521.55 E:0.235700 |  It will extend their run of unbeaten matches to 12
[6134.70 - 6137.02] P:1614.19 E:0.264757 |  It'll be the fourth win in a row for england
[6137.90 - 6141.10] P:1530.41 E:0.245681 |  But from an early stage of this match it was never in any doubt
[6143.02 - 6148.70] P:1513.01 E:0.268762 |  Harry kane currently being credited with the hat trick two penalties and one that hit him and went in
[6148.94 - 6155.42] P:1491.25 E:0.270979 |  However, when we look at the history books in 20 years time, we maybe won't remember that and it's actually the first hat trick that
[6156.30 - 6159.50] P:1537.49 E:0.275382 |  Has been scored for england for almost eight years
[6161.58 - 6169.10] P:1578.16 E:0.276364 |  Ball deflected out of play for a three to panamar england's last hat trick scored by germain de for who got three against bulgaria back in 2010
[6170.62 - 6174.06] P:1704.72 E:0.284016 |  Torres with the ball at the back plays it across to eskibar
[6175.58 - 6177.42] P:1608.64 E:0.249316 |  And now kupa
[6177.42 - 6179.58] P:1607.53 E:0.304727 |  To the left-hand side to davis
[6180.46 - 6182.46] P:1549.40 E:0.286047 |  It's been a lesson for panamar here
[6182.86 - 6185.50] P:1564.43 E:0.292753 |  England have been ruthless against them. They just weren't able to cope
[6185.74 - 6189.90] P:1497.02 E:0.287031 |  Chris for anyone who didn't hear the first half not able to cope with england set pieces really
[6189.98 - 6194.62] P:1602.35 E:0.291546 |  Nails apart in teams and yes, they're honest. They give what they are the right naive
[6195.50 - 6197.82] P:1624.78 E:0.313204 |  Silly free kicks so you pens have given away
[6198.54 - 6200.54] P:1663.49 E:0.280302 |  Very naive say not a lot of discipline
[6201.02 - 6203.90] P:1670.13 E:0.295281 |  The fade-off rating spells some little moments of hard but
[6204.54 - 6206.54] P:1816.98 E:0.284084 |  england different cost-computing at the time
[6206.62 - 6209.58] P:1502.78 E:0.283565 |  Avila, Avila carrying it on. Delph with the challenge
[6210.06 - 6214.06] P:1514.93 E:0.298570 |  Now rodriguez again on the left-hand side who has been busy for panamar cross from davis
[6214.06 - 6219.10] P:1692.60 E:0.301898 |  The captain overhead kick, payas shoots on the turn but it's blocked by maguire and the ball bounces to walker
[6219.18 - 6224.86] P:1492.00 E:0.263322 |  Who's able to pass it away sterling lets the ball run underneath his foot so panamar have possession back
[6225.42 - 6226.54] P:1624.02 E:0.206074 |  balai
[6226.54 - 6230.78] P:1590.12 E:0.270354 |  Forward towards kupa delphi slid in with a challenge panamar coming again
[6230.78 - 6237.74] P:1484.77 E:0.274867 |  Rodriguez is going to have an optimistic shot from 25 yards from an angle and he hits it well way to the far post for a gold kick
[6238.30 - 6240.30] P:1525.46 E:0.288498 |  I think that's about it four minutes played
