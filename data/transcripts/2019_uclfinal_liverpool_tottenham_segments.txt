[0.00 - 4.16] P:1791.65 E:0.103246 |  Thank you, Mark, yes. I hope you're able to enjoy all of this with us,
[4.16 - 8.40] P:1738.64 E:0.094797 |  whether it's finished in 90 minutes, whether we need extra time,
[8.40 - 12.08] P:1636.71 E:0.102955 |  whether we need penalties, but it's been quite a week, hasn't it?
[13.40 - 18.00] P:1796.95 E:0.100048 |  This is the second all-English European final of the week.
[18.00 - 23.24] P:1831.71 E:0.093104 |  Unprecedented that one country should provide all four teams
[23.24 - 25.24] P:1756.48 E:0.077276 |  in the two major finals.
[25.24 - 28.64] P:1801.03 E:0.098464 |  And the Tottenham and Liverpool players
[28.88 - 33.60] P:1759.03 E:0.097385 |  having conducted the handshakes and now pausing for the team pictures.
[33.60 - 35.80] P:1783.20 E:0.091881 |  And it's actually more than the team pictures, Chris.
[35.80 - 38.84] P:1779.98 E:0.086868 |  They've actually both called all of the squad members,
[38.84 - 40.84] P:1603.40 E:0.096562 |  all 23 named for photographs.
[40.84 - 44.64] P:1756.01 E:0.100501 |  Yeah, and it's all Richard Pochettino talk about that togetherness.
[44.64 - 48.44] P:1777.25 E:0.106911 |  You know, they're a squad as a whole, a team as a whole.
[48.44 - 51.24] P:1877.66 E:0.100832 |  And that's good to see. Sums up both managers that.
[52.04 - 53.64] P:1728.28 E:0.107031 |  And they break away now.
[55.24 - 58.04] P:1841.75 E:0.104660 |  Liverpool to the right, Tottenham to the left.
[59.04 - 64.44] P:1728.68 E:0.101908 |  Liverpool in the all red kit and Tottenham are all in white.
[64.44 - 68.44] P:1772.64 E:0.105148 |  Apart from that blue band around the bottom of the shirts, around their waist.
[68.44 - 72.84] P:1678.32 E:0.105527 |  And the players go around and just give one another a final word,
[72.84 - 76.24] P:1757.11 E:0.089938 |  a little hug and prepare for kickoff.
[76.24 - 81.24] P:1792.73 E:0.093785 |  The referee, who is the highly experienced Damius Scrimina.
[81.24 - 84.04] P:1735.92 E:0.093858 |  It's actually something of a surprise that he hasn't refereed
[84.04 - 87.64] P:1688.86 E:0.088835 |  a Champions League final before now, but this completes the set for him.
[87.64 - 92.64] P:1702.58 E:0.095159 |  World Cups, European Championships, all of the major European finals,
[92.64 - 95.04] P:1626.13 E:0.094658 |  one of the top referees around.
[95.04 - 97.44] P:1735.70 E:0.099092 |  And he's walking towards the centre circle now.
[97.44 - 100.24] P:1734.30 E:0.091396 |  Let me just run you through the teams again before kickoff.
[100.24 - 104.64] P:1593.11 E:0.085704 |  Tottenham, Laurie Sengol, Trippia Aldervirold, Fatongan and Rose,
[104.64 - 109.64] P:1639.51 E:0.086299 |  Sissoko and Winks, Ericsson, Ali, Son and Harry Kane.
[109.64 - 116.04] P:1619.12 E:0.092255 |  So both Kane and Winks start the match having not played since April the 9th.
[116.04 - 120.84] P:1645.22 E:0.094445 |  And Liverpool with Allison, Alexander-Arnold, Matip van Dijk and Robertson,
[120.84 - 127.04] P:1502.76 E:0.082805 |  Fabinho, Henderson and Vijnaldum, Salah, Firmino and Mane.
[127.04 - 129.44] P:1516.31 E:0.103216 |  The final will be underway shortly.
[129.44 - 134.64] P:1450.05 E:0.093609 |  But first, as Mark Pugac mentioned, the players are gathering around the centre circle.
[134.64 - 140.64] P:1457.34 E:0.105745 |  And we will have a moment to remember Jose Antonio Reyes,
[140.64 - 143.64] P:1600.32 E:0.101975 |  the shopping news that we heard this morning
[144.24 - 150.24] P:1599.34 E:0.091124 |  that the former Arsenal man has been killed in a car crash at the age of 35.
[150.24 - 155.24] P:1611.21 E:0.100395 |  But he was an Atletico Madrid player and actually outside the stadium
[155.24 - 159.64] P:1608.68 E:0.103976 |  they have plaques on the ground to honour all of the great players
[159.64 - 163.44] P:1685.16 E:0.091070 |  who played for Atletico Madrid at their old stadium.
[163.44 - 167.64] P:1723.45 E:0.090305 |  And there is one out there on the concourse with his name on it.
[167.64 - 173.44] P:1736.04 E:0.098587 |  And now the applause around the stadium to remember Jose Antonio Reyes.
[173.64 - 176.64] P:1761.92 E:0.127504 |  APPLAUSE
[190.64 - 194.64] P:1538.71 E:0.113029 |  The shocking news I was reading on the BBC Sport website,
[194.64 - 197.64] P:1615.73 E:0.103344 |  he only married again in 2017.
[197.64 - 201.64] P:1312.40 E:0.109026 |  He's got three young children and he would have been playing,
[201.64 - 206.64] P:1428.47 E:0.100582 |  would have been due to play tomorrow for extra Madura in the second division.
[206.64 - 208.64] P:1160.49 E:0.089010 |  So sad.
[209.64 - 214.64] P:1466.42 E:0.103638 |  Right, we are set for kick-off now, the 2019 Champions League final.
[214.64 - 219.64] P:1505.26 E:0.106760 |  The Champions League final between two clubs that haven't been champions of England for many a year,
[219.64 - 226.64] P:1619.98 E:0.098442 |  many a decade, but tonight either Tottenham or Liverpool will be kings of Europe.
[226.64 - 232.64] P:1663.00 E:0.095993 |  The sky is blue, the Spanish sun is shining down on the Metropolitan
[232.64 - 237.64] P:1536.52 E:0.097057 |  or here on the north-east fringe of the city of the Spanish capital.
[237.64 - 241.64] P:1563.97 E:0.115091 |  And it is Liverpool who get us underway with the captain, Jordan Henderson,
[241.64 - 247.64] P:1444.54 E:0.089220 |  who plays the ball back into central defence to Matip who strikes it downfield.
[247.64 - 250.64] P:1568.32 E:0.103143 |  Liverpool are playing from right to left in the first half.
[250.64 - 255.64] P:1649.55 E:0.100231 |  You're listening to us on BBC Radio 5 Live, but the World's servicers are with us as well.
[255.64 - 259.64] P:1677.03 E:0.097301 |  As Henderson plays the ball over the top to Sario Mane on the edge of the area.
[259.64 - 263.64] P:1720.27 E:0.119275 |  Mane into the box crosses it, it strikes the arms of Sissoko, it's a penalty!
[263.64 - 268.64] P:1682.71 E:0.113100 |  Referee Scrimina has pointed to the spot, it's a handball,
[268.64 - 273.64] P:1738.47 E:0.105009 |  it struts the outstretched arm of Sissoko with less than 30 seconds on the clock.
[273.64 - 276.64] P:1721.00 E:0.106753 |  Liverpool have a penalty, Chris Suggin.
[276.64 - 281.64] P:1650.92 E:0.099086 |  Well, that's an unbelievable call from the referee.
[281.64 - 285.64] P:1810.17 E:0.098803 |  Mane kicks the ball against, I think it hits Sissoko's chest.
[285.64 - 291.64] P:1754.67 E:0.094109 |  But first, his arm is out, it hits his arm, but that is soft, he can't give that.
[291.64 - 295.64] P:1812.92 E:0.100503 |  This will be reviewed by VAR, Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager here as well.
[295.64 - 299.64] P:1703.42 E:0.097009 |  I don't think he did that, that's so early in the game, it's hit him on his chest.
[299.64 - 302.64] P:1651.29 E:0.089408 |  I think he will, but it's hit him on his chest, hit him on the arm.
[302.64 - 310.64] P:1616.70 E:0.091248 |  This is the referee who gave the penalty to Manchester United in the dying stages at the park de Prans.
[310.64 - 316.64] P:1636.61 E:0.096489 |  The check is over, it's a penalty and Salah is ready to take it.
[316.64 - 324.64] P:1593.26 E:0.089019 |  We're in the second minute now and Referee Scrimina has actually walked right across to the goal line
[324.64 - 326.64] P:1615.42 E:0.102938 |  to talk to Hugo Lloris who's standing behind the line.
[326.64 - 331.64] P:1518.60 E:0.101251 |  He saved his last three penalties that have been taken against him,
[331.64 - 334.64] P:1541.56 E:0.083929 |  the French goalkeeper and Tottenham captain.
[334.64 - 339.64] P:1689.83 E:0.088574 |  But this is Mohamed Salah who had to go off early in the Champions League final one year ago
[339.64 - 343.64] P:1786.05 E:0.083101 |  in Kiev, here in the second minute.
[343.64 - 347.64] P:1764.41 E:0.103679 |  He's going to take a penalty left footed and scores!
[347.64 - 350.64] P:1680.73 E:0.118429 |  Lloris dives to his left but couldn't stop it.
[350.64 - 358.64] P:1614.30 E:0.116095 |  It was struck with too much pace by Mohamed Salah and Liverpool are in front
[358.64 - 363.64] P:1607.88 E:0.114661 |  with two minutes on the clock, a controversial penalty award.
[363.64 - 367.64] P:1618.26 E:0.113826 |  Controversial as it was, did we expect anything else?
[367.64 - 369.64] P:1470.51 E:0.109209 |  It was magnificent!
[369.64 - 374.64] P:1545.01 E:0.107854 |  Mohamed Salah starts with the straight run, a couple of steps to his right
[374.64 - 377.64] P:1464.16 E:0.114862 |  and then he hammers the ball down the middle of the goal.
[377.64 - 381.64] P:1630.02 E:0.112212 |  Lloris goes early and Liverpool take the lead.
[381.64 - 385.64] P:1523.10 E:0.109887 |  I think the challenge the referee has got is that his arm is in a strange position
[385.64 - 387.64] P:1602.81 E:0.096157 |  but it does hit his chest first.
[387.64 - 389.64] P:1596.37 E:0.107325 |  I've got to say I don't know what his arm is up there for
[389.64 - 392.64] P:1623.62 E:0.104101 |  but it does hit the corner of his chest, sorry, and then goes in.
[392.64 - 399.64] P:1595.33 E:0.103585 |  Fantastic execution with his laces, power, pace, bravery to go more or less down the middle.
[399.64 - 401.64] P:1576.48 E:0.101225 |  He takes a brave kick, stands still.
[401.64 - 404.64] P:1626.01 E:0.093450 |  Lloris went the right way, diving to his left.
[404.64 - 408.64] P:1709.40 E:0.102028 |  It actually went above his head, just above his head by probably a couple of feet
[408.64 - 412.64] P:1688.21 E:0.095222 |  but it was just struck too powerfully and it's shot them nil.
[412.64 - 415.64] P:1594.16 E:0.094642 |  Liverpool won in the Champions League final.
[415.64 - 420.64] P:1671.93 E:0.102819 |  He knew exactly what he wanted to do, stroked it in, a beautifully confident penalty.
[421.64 - 423.64] P:1677.88 E:0.095943 |  So important now to stay calm, I think.
[423.64 - 426.64] P:1645.86 E:0.100218 |  So important, not easy by the way but Tottenham stay calm now.
[426.64 - 429.64] P:1603.11 E:0.101264 |  Does the game open up? Did Liverpool go to Keiji?
[429.64 - 432.64] P:1457.80 E:0.102378 |  Did they open the game up and go for it? It's going to be interesting.
[432.64 - 434.64] P:1539.14 E:0.105221 |  Well, there's no rushes for Tottenham.
[434.64 - 437.64] P:1546.73 E:0.104855 |  We talked about them being behind in this competition.
[437.64 - 441.64] P:1544.05 E:0.098322 |  They've come back all season against all odds.
[441.64 - 444.64] P:1673.95 E:0.103201 |  A goal down in two minutes, shouldn't worry this Tottenham team.
[445.64 - 447.64] P:1451.06 E:0.107576 |  Tottenham nil, Liverpool won.
[447.64 - 450.64] P:1583.95 E:0.086849 |  If you miss kickoff, you've missed the opening goal.
[450.64 - 452.64] P:1624.73 E:0.093424 |  A handball given against Sasoko.
[452.64 - 455.64] P:1640.06 E:0.102113 |  Mane was on the left side of the penalty area near the edge of the box.
[455.64 - 459.64] P:1622.76 E:0.097166 |  Just looked to play it across and Sasoko's arm was outstretched
[459.64 - 462.64] P:1523.86 E:0.094650 |  and it hit him just right at the top of his right arm.
[462.64 - 466.64] P:1590.97 E:0.109123 |  The one thing you would say is why is Sasoko got his arm up in that position?
[466.64 - 468.64] P:1528.41 E:0.108019 |  No, I agree. It's in a natural position.
[468.64 - 472.64] P:1375.96 E:0.114417 |  I think that's got him in trouble actually because it does hit his chest first
[472.64 - 474.64] P:1375.55 E:0.113938 |  but it is a strange position to have your arm in
[474.64 - 477.64] P:1409.06 E:0.100245 |  and nowadays you have to say what is your arm doing up there?
[477.64 - 481.64] P:1562.93 E:0.108320 |  The penalty was awarded after 23 seconds of the Champions League final.
[481.64 - 484.64] P:1364.19 E:0.110663 |  Look at Liverpool now on the press, really on the press front foot.
[484.64 - 486.64] P:1495.83 E:0.102867 |  Look at the body language, a shift in it.
[486.64 - 490.64] P:1191.63 E:0.098559 |  You know, really trying to stop their authority after the back on the back of that goal.
[490.64 - 493.64] P:1570.74 E:0.108107 |  But as Sean Deitch and Chris Setten are rightly saying,
[493.64 - 496.64] P:1558.41 E:0.119123 |  Tottenham have been here before in this situation.
[496.64 - 499.64] P:1501.75 E:0.106516 |  They've never been here before though in the Champions League final.
[499.64 - 503.64] P:1435.64 E:0.099712 |  The first time they have ever been in this position.
[503.64 - 507.64] P:1518.87 E:0.103026 |  In the final of Europe's Premier Club competition
[507.64 - 510.64] P:1502.17 E:0.098457 |  and within two minutes they're one nil down.
[510.64 - 514.64] P:1558.72 E:0.100929 |  He has Dali Ali though on the corner of the penalty area into Son inside the parks
[514.64 - 518.64] P:1691.16 E:0.100579 |  and then in comes the challenge from Henderson just to talk or get behind for a corner to Spurs.
[518.64 - 522.64] P:1717.03 E:0.090290 |  There's a good run from Ali trying to get in on the diagonal in behind.
[522.64 - 526.64] P:1781.06 E:0.093811 |  Alexander Arnold actually hits Alexander Arnold in the backside.
[526.64 - 531.64] P:1807.90 E:0.098772 |  He prods the ball to Son and Henderson, was alert and poked the ball behind.
[532.64 - 535.64] P:1732.04 E:0.084768 |  Tottenham get an opportunity from a corner.
[535.64 - 538.64] P:1805.00 E:0.079207 |  Corner to be taken from the left.
[538.64 - 540.64] P:1792.64 E:0.075303 |  The end to our right.
[540.64 - 545.64] P:1835.50 E:0.090828 |  Three tiers, four if you include the hospitality tier, is completely red.
[545.64 - 547.64] P:1771.08 E:0.102706 |  That's where the Liverpool fans are. They are jubilant.
[547.64 - 550.64] P:1826.73 E:0.080918 |  But Tottenham with the set piece.
[550.64 - 553.64] P:1874.00 E:0.101180 |  Harry Kane on the edge of the six yard box, Dali Ali just in front of it.
[553.64 - 556.64] P:1738.37 E:0.098626 |  Here's the delivery curling towards the back post.
[556.64 - 559.64] P:1653.47 E:0.106113 |  The target was for Tongan but it was headed away by Van Dijk.
[559.64 - 564.64] P:1590.24 E:0.092259 |  And now Socol is able to take the ball down and play it all the way back into his own half.
[564.64 - 567.64] P:1509.33 E:0.091791 |  That's been one of the big differences set piece wise for Liverpool.
[567.64 - 570.64] P:1422.13 E:0.093974 |  Defensively Van Dijk is like a magnet in there.
[570.64 - 573.64] P:1332.58 E:0.092437 |  When the ball goes in there he's like a magnet to that ball. He heads everything.
[573.64 - 579.64] P:1551.34 E:0.090791 |  Tottenham nil, Liverpool one. BBC Radio 5 Live, the World Service.
[579.64 - 584.64] P:1583.52 E:0.098904 |  Listeners on BBC London and Radio Merseyside are with us as well.
[584.64 - 588.64] P:1591.31 E:0.090679 |  So welcome to you all. Fabinho playing it through the middle now to
[588.64 - 593.64] P:1560.10 E:0.090905 |  Sadio Mane who turns and moves to his right. Henderson is there, little touch from him.
[593.64 - 597.64] P:1488.88 E:0.083510 |  Now back to Mane who just rolls his left foot over the ball,
[597.64 - 600.64] P:1668.86 E:0.095610 |  then gives it in to Salah on the edge of the box.
[600.64 - 604.64] P:1625.11 E:0.104645 |  Heavy touch there from Son on the edge of his own area and then it's sliced out of play
[604.64 - 606.64] P:1589.79 E:0.100602 |  on the far side for a throwing to Liverpool.
[606.64 - 610.64] P:1697.58 E:0.097677 |  That Liverpool attack all came from a really sloppy ball.
[610.64 - 613.64] P:1474.88 E:0.079835 |  Kira and Trippie in that right bank position.
[613.64 - 617.64] P:1522.44 E:0.098640 |  Nervy start from him but Mane looks electric doesn't he?
[617.64 - 621.64] P:1444.22 E:0.095277 |  His early sages, drifting in, linking up.
[621.64 - 623.64] P:1332.52 E:0.099249 |  What a start for Liverpool.
[623.64 - 625.64] P:1563.07 E:0.090735 |  I was saying this morning, Chris, when we were on breakfast,
[625.64 - 630.64] P:1440.41 E:0.088236 |  that if this Champions League final throws up even anything like,
[630.64 - 635.64] P:1699.04 E:0.092163 |  even a fraction of the thrills and spills that we've seen in the Champions League this season,
[635.64 - 638.64] P:1608.48 E:0.100196 |  then it should be quite a spectacle and it started with a bang.
[638.64 - 643.64] P:1635.30 E:0.092596 |  Here, Tottenham with Son on the left-hand side. Alexander-Arnold does well.
[643.64 - 646.64] P:1762.85 E:0.108816 |  The ball rolls towards the dead ball line and he turns and plays it out for a throw up the line.
[646.64 - 648.64] P:1707.83 E:0.106734 |  Do you know what one of the hardest things is?
[648.64 - 652.64] P:1400.40 E:0.091917 |  Imagine all the planets going to immediately change everything on the point of both sides,
[652.64 - 654.64] P:1461.38 E:0.097676 |  particularly Tottenham of course.
[654.64 - 658.64] P:1380.67 E:0.104632 |  That early goal changed the whole field of what all the tactical plan was.
[658.64 - 660.64] P:1592.02 E:0.113534 |  Sean Dij, the Burnley manager is here with us.
[660.64 - 663.64] P:1591.31 E:0.103043 |  Chris Sutton who's played and scored in the Champions League.
[663.64 - 666.64] P:1627.13 E:0.105900 |  Welsh international Robbie Savage is here as well.
[666.64 - 667.64] P:1519.24 E:0.115342 |  He'll be hosting 6-0-6.
[667.64 - 670.64] P:1448.66 E:0.117172 |  We'll hear from him in a little while as well.
[670.64 - 673.64] P:1542.38 E:0.109533 |  But here is Socol, inside his own half.
[673.64 - 676.64] P:1561.13 E:0.099115 |  Tottenham trying to recover from conceding the early goal.
[676.64 - 679.64] P:1447.63 E:0.099779 |  And then Erexham plays the ball forward beyond the Liverpool backline.
[679.64 - 682.64] P:1549.17 E:0.096591 |  Alexander-Arnold back to Allyson who had to stretch for that
[682.64 - 685.64] P:1593.91 E:0.096743 |  and he immediately apologises to Liverpool right back.
[685.64 - 687.64] P:1590.80 E:0.089881 |  That was nervy, wasn't it, from Alexander-Arnold?
[687.64 - 691.64] P:1679.16 E:0.097239 |  Not the best ball. Allyson's stretch actually went down.
[691.64 - 695.64] P:1543.90 E:0.084335 |  Throin taken to Socol. He's 30 yards out, angles it back.
[695.64 - 698.64] P:1508.72 E:0.091289 |  Stumble from Trippier here but Winx is in possession.
[698.64 - 701.64] P:1610.71 E:0.096184 |  Harry Winx who's come back after a groin operation
[701.64 - 704.64] P:1848.26 E:0.084373 |  and yet is fit to start the Champions League final.
[704.64 - 707.64] P:1779.01 E:0.100438 |  Alderweirow swings the ball out high to the left-hand side.
[707.64 - 709.64] P:1667.71 E:0.108758 |  Rose, heavy touch from him.
[709.64 - 712.64] P:1778.22 E:0.096109 |  He was at full pace, took a touch but it bounced away
[712.64 - 714.64] P:1524.26 E:0.075589 |  and out of play for a throw into Liverpool.
[714.64 - 717.64] P:1448.10 E:0.073304 |  This early in the game, I think, particularly from Tottenham,
[717.64 - 719.64] P:1495.75 E:0.093418 |  they've got to stick to whatever the plan was.
[719.64 - 721.64] P:1460.91 E:0.093676 |  We don't know what the internal plan was from the manager.
[721.64 - 726.64] P:1459.75 E:0.092013 |  Stick with Alton, 1-0, it's a tough bit of a pill to swallow this early in the game.
[726.64 - 729.64] P:1365.80 E:0.098603 |  But just stick with what you thought was right because it's still in theory right.
[729.64 - 732.64] P:1296.71 E:0.094260 |  And I don't throw that when the stake arm keeps delivering it.
[732.64 - 737.64] P:1530.80 E:0.092852 |  Throin for Alexander-Arnold but it was intercepted by the chest of Cisoco
[737.64 - 739.64] P:1634.91 E:0.098364 |  who claimed that he was fouled by Fabinho.
[739.64 - 741.64] P:1635.81 E:0.076054 |  Referee Scamino says no, hit downfield.
[741.64 - 744.64] P:1595.47 E:0.092378 |  Danny Rose on the left-hand side, a high foot from Firmino
[744.64 - 746.64] P:1624.53 E:0.092152 |  but didn't make contact with the Tottenham left back.
[746.64 - 749.64] P:1733.91 E:0.082554 |  Deli Alley back to Rose.
[749.64 - 752.64] P:1919.05 E:0.105148 |  And I suppose Chris as well, you mentioned it already.
[752.64 - 758.64] P:1947.40 E:0.089692 |  The setbacks that they have had to deal with in this Champions League this season,
[758.64 - 763.64] P:1875.22 E:0.093261 |  they have remarkably Tottenham always been able to get back eventually into their stride.
[763.64 - 765.64] P:1948.49 E:0.105408 |  Yeah, and that will all be in the memory bank.
[765.64 - 769.64] P:1818.45 E:0.095689 |  The trouble they have is they are playing an outstanding Liverpool team.
[769.64 - 771.64] P:1772.63 E:0.086408 |  Son down the left-hand side, this looks promising.
[771.64 - 774.64] P:1689.90 E:0.093047 |  Tried to slip the ball in field, Henderson was able to get a foot in.
[774.64 - 776.64] P:1726.29 E:0.092637 |  Ericsson on the edge of the box, back to Son now.
[776.64 - 780.64] P:1754.75 E:0.100512 |  Son trying to weave his way through past two men but then the final line of defence.
[780.64 - 785.64] P:1624.60 E:0.104730 |  And then it comes out to Cisoco who hits the shot from 25 yards plus
[785.64 - 787.64] P:1732.26 E:0.094596 |  and it flies away over the bar.
[787.64 - 792.64] P:1582.84 E:0.092533 |  A live leap from Son off that left-hand side, dancing feet inside the box
[792.64 - 797.64] P:1522.30 E:0.093271 |  and then Firmino, good interception again and as the ball goes out to Cisoco
[797.64 - 800.64] P:1449.99 E:0.101354 |  I just wondered could he have hit it first time, took a touch
[800.64 - 805.64] P:1390.14 E:0.098024 |  and then wild where the shot goes a long way over the Liverpool bar.
[805.64 - 808.64] P:1412.92 E:0.097358 |  Alison, the Liverpool goalkeeper passing the ball out.
[808.64 - 812.64] P:1666.07 E:0.086339 |  As Liverpool like to do Firmino, he was under pressure from Son.
[812.64 - 814.64] P:1665.49 E:0.082741 |  Kane wasn't far away.
[814.64 - 818.64] P:1565.03 E:0.097397 |  So from the middle of his own half he turned and just gave the ball back to Alison
[818.64 - 820.64] P:1691.44 E:0.116020 |  and now it's long for Liverpool from Manny to Chase.
[820.64 - 823.64] P:1612.77 E:0.092906 |  Manny left side of the box and then
[823.64 - 828.64] P:1680.53 E:0.103658 |  Incomes Kieran Trippier with the challenge, just got there, timed it well, corner Liverpool.
[828.64 - 831.64] P:1435.13 E:0.091316 |  It's the second time they've put it in behind Trippier, you know,
[831.64 - 834.64] P:1547.86 E:0.090566 |  that looks to me like the early questions are being asked,
[834.64 - 837.64] P:1391.27 E:0.094312 |  you know, can we get our wide players, our fast wide players,
[837.64 - 840.64] P:1438.22 E:0.100855 |  can we get them high and wide, can we get them working off the shoulder
[840.64 - 842.64] P:1522.32 E:0.089756 |  of the back floor at Tottenham?
[842.64 - 847.64] P:1733.22 E:0.097686 |  He's a player Trippier who's really lacked confidence this season
[847.64 - 853.64] P:1712.27 E:0.089451 |  and Liverpool, it's a plan and trying to exploit Spurs in that right back position.
[853.64 - 857.64] P:1537.63 E:0.091644 |  Very powerful from Setpieces, by the way, Liverpool this season,
[857.64 - 860.64] P:1482.24 E:0.095365 |  I think they've got 30 of their 89 goals from Setpieces in the Premier League,
[860.64 - 862.64] P:1481.27 E:0.091743 |  varying sorts including penalties of course.
[862.64 - 867.64] P:1583.43 E:0.098189 |  It's interesting here as well, Sean, the Liverpool players are very much crowding Lloris.
[867.64 - 871.64] P:1664.48 E:0.091458 |  They've got five men virtually on the goal line, they're surrounding Lloris.
[871.64 - 875.64] P:1469.98 E:0.090168 |  It looks like they're going to whip it on top of him, see what the referee does with this.
[875.64 - 879.64] P:1685.28 E:0.095740 |  That's the plan, remember the goal that Lloris conceded at Anfield just a couple of months ago.
[879.64 - 884.64] P:1584.32 E:0.097648 |  Alexander-Ianl plays it in, Lloris gets up there, punches it down into the penalty area,
[884.64 - 890.64] P:1685.05 E:0.090125 |  it bounces out of the box and is cleared away downfield, a clear Liverpool tactic.
[890.64 - 895.64] P:1549.89 E:0.072528 |  Yep, load the ball in but that was a good French fist.
[895.64 - 905.64] P:1452.97 E:0.091168 |  Tottenham 0, Liverpool 1, here in Madrid, lovely orangey sunshine on the top of the roof of the Metropolitan,
[905.64 - 910.64] P:1440.22 E:0.092147 |  where it says Madrid 19 final and we've got the crests of the two clubs.
[910.64 - 915.64] P:1357.89 E:0.097377 |  Liverpool long pass downfield but that's way beyond Mohamed Salah.
[915.64 - 919.64] P:1432.63 E:0.096395 |  He's got his goal in the Champions League final, be it from the penalty spot,
[919.64 - 926.64] P:1424.31 E:0.103828 |  so that edges him ahead of Manet in the Liverpool top scorer stakes this season, his 27th of the season.
[926.64 - 932.64] P:1560.14 E:0.091406 |  And some say he's had an indifferent season, ridiculous.
[932.64 - 937.64] P:1593.75 E:0.098731 |  Tottenham with a throw, Rose takes it when the Spurs go marching in.
[937.64 - 942.64] P:1605.83 E:0.109134 |  We're hearing that in full force now as Kane goes into the challenge.
[942.64 - 948.64] P:1610.71 E:0.087609 |  It was Alexander-Arnold, it was Matip who came in with the challenge,
[948.64 - 952.64] P:1703.10 E:0.087997 |  caught Kane who went spiralling over and crashed down onto the surface.
[952.64 - 958.64] P:1589.96 E:0.089166 |  He's okay, he's going to be back on his feet, it's a free kick and I think Matip is going to be only ticked off for that.
[958.64 - 962.64] P:1766.57 E:0.099019 |  I actually thought he wins the ball first time against Ali.
[962.64 - 966.64] P:1443.31 E:0.082434 |  I'm very, very surprised that he has a booked in there, very surprised.
[966.64 - 970.64] P:1438.94 E:0.092685 |  I know they often talk referees letting the game settle but I'm very surprised.
[970.64 - 975.64] P:1706.64 E:0.102082 |  Free kick taken quickly to Son, it was taken quickly by Dali Ali, he was a little unfortunate.
[975.64 - 982.64] P:1560.86 E:0.082587 |  It was just deflected off Son onto the Liverpool defender and it bounced away from him
[982.64 - 986.64] P:1427.67 E:0.086709 |  and Liverpool were able to clear downfield, so it's a throw in to Tottenham, half inside, they're on half.
[986.64 - 993.64] P:1372.53 E:0.098382 |  We played 12 minutes, BBC Radio 5 live, the World Service, BBC London, Radio Merseyside, live from beautiful Madrid
[993.64 - 999.64] P:1306.75 E:0.091829 |  where the weather, the temperature, he said it was going to be around about 30 degrees, it's kickoff.
[999.64 - 1005.64] P:1235.30 E:0.097086 |  Coming up here in the stand, it's absolutely beautiful. Won't be so easy down there on the pitch.
[1005.64 - 1012.64] P:1361.49 E:0.093936 |  Here is Tha Tongan at the back, he was another one who was doubtful after picking up an injury, an ankle injury in the semi-final in Amsterdam.
[1012.64 - 1020.64] P:1492.87 E:0.086694 |  Like it goes to Hugo Lloris, Lloris, long and left footed towards the halfway line but Alexander-Arnold wins the head up for Liverpool
[1020.64 - 1025.64] P:1522.44 E:0.093605 |  five times European champions, Van Dijk heads it over the halfway line, rolls.
[1025.64 - 1031.64] P:1557.67 E:0.093246 |  Now here's Son on the left-hand side, Son back into central defence again for Tha Tongan, Liverpool whistles
[1031.64 - 1038.64] P:1827.90 E:0.104048 |  because Tottenham have the ball inside their own half and then it's drilled forward, left footed by Tha Tongan.
[1038.64 - 1045.64] P:1706.61 E:0.096684 |  Trippier at full tilt, gets there as well, near the dead ball line, turns, gives it back to Ericsson, near the right corner of the box.
[1045.64 - 1053.64] P:1750.89 E:0.094890 |  Now it's back to Soco with the white wristbands on, back to Ericsson on the right-hand side, Ericsson whips a left-footed ball towards the back post
[1053.64 - 1058.64] P:1673.32 E:0.098087 |  but Alexander-Arnold was able to get up and head it out towards the far side for a throw.
[1058.64 - 1062.64] P:1691.96 E:0.092613 |  That wasn't a very good crossing position, Sean, they had a couple of times to put the ball in.
[1062.64 - 1067.64] P:1383.74 E:0.090737 |  Yeah, I mean a nice roll-up from Ericsson, he knows, got great delivery, I'm amazed he didn't just whip that in.
[1067.64 - 1072.64] P:1406.88 E:0.101881 |  You know, the power, the pace that he's got to put that in, you can see Tottenham now even to open the pitch up,
[1072.64 - 1078.64] P:1440.96 E:0.098010 |  that means that Liverpool have to be defensively resilient, work on their distances, work on their shape.
[1078.64 - 1082.64] P:1508.28 E:0.081705 |  But as I said, you know, in the show, very, very good on transition Liverpool,
[1082.64 - 1087.64] P:1374.35 E:0.087379 |  really dangerous game Tottenham have got to play now because they've got to open up, try and open up on Liverpool defence,
[1087.64 - 1091.64] P:1400.04 E:0.097760 |  working at a good block at the moment, but it's a dangerous tactic I think.
[1091.64 - 1096.64] P:1567.04 E:0.104149 |  Another raking pass from central defence, from this time Alder-Viral, Trippier was right on the white line
[1096.64 - 1102.64] P:1544.80 E:0.101365 |  and he chested it back in but the ball was already out, so Liverpool have a throw, just down in front of us,
[1102.64 - 1110.64] P:1364.02 E:0.084333 |  next to where the blue carpet is, in front of the tunnel with the image of the trophy itself,
[1110.64 - 1115.64] P:1521.22 E:0.099819 |  just off the field, in between where Jurgen Klopp is standing with his hands behind his back,
[1115.64 - 1121.64] P:1699.60 E:0.090219 |  Mauricio Pochettino currently just sitting down in the dugout, Mauricio Pochettino,
[1121.64 - 1127.64] P:1612.45 E:0.086464 |  yet to win the major trophy as a manager, Espanyol, Southampton,
[1127.64 - 1134.64] P:1683.47 E:0.097941 |  and now Tottenham and Jurgen Klopp, who's looking to win his first trophy as the manager of Liverpool.
[1134.64 - 1140.64] P:1560.66 E:0.096756 |  Mauricio Pochettino, five years this week since he was appointed, he has delialli, but it bounces away from him,
[1140.64 - 1146.64] P:1461.39 E:0.101022 |  Robertson's pass was a little fortunate there, bounce back to him, and then Vinaldon also can't keep the ball,
[1146.64 - 1152.64] P:1546.02 E:0.104007 |  and Tottenham have got it back inside their own half, and Pochettino now suddenly appears from underneath the roof of the dugout,
[1152.64 - 1157.64] P:1509.51 E:0.080954 |  skipping forward in clearly anger to the edge of the coaching area.
[1157.64 - 1160.64] P:1633.20 E:0.105033 |  Alexander-Andre allows the ball to bounce behind from the ball.
[1160.64 - 1165.64] P:1620.00 E:0.088328 |  You know, both teams they play, we spoke about it, good distances, good on the front foot, trying to get the back foot up,
[1165.64 - 1172.64] P:1430.44 E:0.092509 |  and if you notice the main threat at the moment has been getting good quality in mind, either back four.
[1172.64 - 1176.64] P:1453.46 E:0.104358 |  Quarter of an hour played, Tottenham nil, Liverpool won, with 15 minutes played,
[1176.64 - 1183.64] P:1529.48 E:0.095992 |  why don't we bring in Robbie Savage for a view on the first 15 minutes of the match, Robbie?
[1183.64 - 1191.64] P:1410.30 E:0.096563 |  Yeah, I'm not sure Liverpool have played in that, well I think Tottenham have come into the game since the penalty was ward after 23 seconds.
[1191.64 - 1200.64] P:1525.26 E:0.092336 |  See, I think it is a penalty, I think with the new, you know, the way V-I's instructed in the Champions League, I think that is a penalty.
[1200.64 - 1210.64] P:1404.19 E:0.091085 |  Thanks Robbie. I think as well, you know, when you see that, now we are used to the fact that in a UEFA match, that will be given as a penalty.
[1210.64 - 1216.64] P:1486.06 E:0.097318 |  Yeah, and I think that is the magic of V-I-R though, because I think, my personally, my initial reaction, as you know, was that was harsh.
[1216.64 - 1220.64] P:1580.15 E:0.099267 |  The more I looked at it, the more I saw this out of position right on, then you think, no, it's got to be given.
[1220.64 - 1222.64] P:1632.27 E:0.098530 |  So that's what V-I-R's there for.
[1222.64 - 1230.64] P:1501.21 E:0.085162 |  We were both at the V-I-R meeting when we, John, referees, they're told to give them as harsh as it seems.
[1230.64 - 1238.64] P:1408.61 E:0.104229 |  That's what Damia Scrimina did in Paris, when Marcus Rashford scored the penalty and won the match for Manchester United, or won the tie for Manchester United.
[1238.64 - 1241.64] P:1304.68 E:0.095695 |  And that's what he did here when Salah scored in the second minute.
[1241.64 - 1249.64] P:1616.85 E:0.104307 |  So Liverpool leading 1-0, here's Henderson, the Liverpool captain gives it to Alexander-Arnold, who's going to shoot from the angle, 30 yards out,
[1249.64 - 1253.64] P:1790.49 E:0.103048 |  and that was not far away across goal and wide of the foot of the post.
[1253.64 - 1261.64] P:1559.35 E:0.085947 |  Here's another interception, good reading of the play from Favigno, Prodster-Ball to Henderson, who feeds it to Alexander-Arnold.
[1261.64 - 1269.64] P:1603.97 E:0.084663 |  He must be all of 30 yards out, and he cuts across the ball, all sorts of swads on it, and he's not far away.
[1269.64 - 1273.64] P:1605.92 E:0.070184 |  Just past that right-hand post of Larisse.
[1273.64 - 1283.64] P:1699.46 E:0.107814 |  Tottenham-Nill, Liverpool 1, and we've got a pitch in Vada, who's running into the centre-circle, so play obviously has to be stopped.
[1283.64 - 1293.64] P:1643.36 E:0.094374 |  And she has now been caught by a couple of stewards and is being taken away, the ball was just in the centre of the field.
[1293.64 - 1295.64] P:1608.36 E:0.091773 |  So 1-0 to Liverpool.
[1295.64 - 1302.64] P:1680.33 E:0.087628 |  Liverpool have actually conceded the first goal in their last four Champions League finals, European Champions League finals.
[1302.64 - 1310.64] P:1681.81 E:0.091200 |  Not this time, they're ahead in this match, and incidentally when Liverpool have won this trophy, the five times they've won it,
[1310.64 - 1315.64] P:1606.15 E:0.072089 |  they've all been against teams wearing white.
[1315.64 - 1318.64] P:1483.50 E:0.091797 |  Liverpool in red tonight, Tottenham in white.
[1318.64 - 1320.64] P:1608.50 E:0.092532 |  So you're ruling Spurs out then, John?
[1320.64 - 1325.64] P:1612.15 E:0.083496 |  Well, I'm not ruling them out because they played a team in white last year and lost.
[1325.64 - 1330.64] P:1402.72 E:0.071486 |  Here's Alisson with the ball, as players back underway.
[1330.64 - 1333.64] P:1421.77 E:0.084322 |  Ball towards the left-hand side, towards Robertson.
[1333.64 - 1338.64] P:1565.22 E:0.092321 |  And then Sario Mane felt that he was fouled there as the challenge came in from Tripp, yeah?
[1338.64 - 1341.64] P:1583.96 E:0.099836 |  Ericsson plays it through the middle, bounces off Henderson.
[1341.64 - 1343.64] P:1496.09 E:0.091724 |  Now it's back with Matip.
[1343.64 - 1346.64] P:1567.63 E:0.098751 |  And now Fabinho in the centre-circle, Henderson takes it on.
[1346.64 - 1349.64] P:1684.36 E:0.111533 |  Henderson sees space for Robertson on the left-hand side.
[1349.64 - 1353.64] P:1681.93 E:0.094071 |  This is typical Andy Robertson, off he goes, down the left wing.
[1353.64 - 1358.64] P:1648.92 E:0.094017 |  But then that's typical Sosoko to come in, strongly is able to get a touch on the ball.
[1358.64 - 1362.64] P:1651.51 E:0.102448 |  And then Robertson with a touch too, and he's able to shappered it behind four.
[1362.64 - 1364.64] P:1707.68 E:0.110574 |  Goal kick to Tottenham near the corner.
[1364.64 - 1368.64] P:1225.32 E:0.094391 |  So important when Tottenham are playing, they're passing through them in for the gut to keep the ball.
[1368.64 - 1373.64] P:1391.81 E:0.096135 |  On turnover there, you can see how quickly Mane, or quickly Salah, they break off their shape,
[1373.64 - 1376.64] P:1603.25 E:0.079025 |  and they drive towards the goal, waiting for the chance to operate on transition,
[1376.64 - 1378.64] P:1366.73 E:0.086257 |  waiting for the quality to come in behind the back four,
[1378.64 - 1381.64] P:1524.15 E:0.079408 |  and they know they've got the place to get away from the back four of Tottenham.
[1381.64 - 1384.64] P:1637.87 E:0.101857 |  Ball up towards Harry Keane, not really being able to get into the game just yet.
[1384.64 - 1385.64] P:1413.98 E:0.108511 |  Tottenham one-nil down.
[1385.64 - 1388.64] P:1714.09 E:0.116999 |  Oh, that's a lovely ball from Ericsson, through towards Son,
[1388.64 - 1392.64] P:1665.13 E:0.110017 |  and then crucial defending from Trent Alexander-Arnold,
[1392.64 - 1397.64] P:1645.62 E:0.102769 |  who went across with Son and was able to just get a touch on the ball and take it away from him.
[1397.64 - 1403.64] P:1630.80 E:0.095101 |  But classic Ericsson with that pass from inside his own half, probably ten yards inside his own territory.
[1403.64 - 1406.64] P:1723.01 E:0.092144 |  Tottenham still pressing here, Deli Alley, square.
[1406.64 - 1408.64] P:1800.73 E:0.090840 |  Now it's with Winx, back to Deli Alley.
[1408.64 - 1411.64] P:1816.17 E:0.103024 |  Winx allows it to run to Ericsson just outside the D.
[1411.64 - 1413.64] P:1712.42 E:0.112047 |  So close to slipping it through again, Ericsson,
[1413.64 - 1417.64] P:1637.03 E:0.106523 |  but this time Henderson was able to intercept and prevented from reaching Son.
[1417.64 - 1420.64] P:1543.42 E:0.086934 |  Great defending there, great team play for Henderson,
[1420.64 - 1422.64] P:1602.85 E:0.094288 |  to work back, to into his back four to stop that chance.
[1422.64 - 1428.64] P:1693.22 E:0.087803 |  Ball swung in from the left-hand side, but straight into the arms of Allyson, Chris Sutton.
[1428.64 - 1433.64] P:1664.30 E:0.103268 |  Yeah, we just saw that the earlier chance came from really good hold-up play from Harry Keane.
[1433.64 - 1437.64] P:1536.48 E:0.068011 |  Death touch into the path of Ericsson.
[1437.64 - 1440.64] P:1703.40 E:0.080585 |  Question marks over Keane, his fitness.
[1440.64 - 1445.64] P:1571.04 E:0.088024 |  Can he last? Is he fully fit? It's a decent start, but they need to give him the service.
[1445.64 - 1449.64] P:1563.47 E:0.100368 |  Yeah, if you've just joined us, the team news was that Keane and Winx are fit.
[1449.64 - 1452.64] P:1500.92 E:0.098505 |  They're both playing, they both started the Champions League final,
[1452.64 - 1458.64] P:1322.04 E:0.089517 |  and likewise Firmino for Liverpool, who's not really got into the game Firmino for Liverpool.
[1458.64 - 1461.64] P:1457.57 E:0.093866 |  Here's Henderson, now on the halfway line, Henderson towards the right-hand side.
[1461.64 - 1465.64] P:1663.43 E:0.099283 |  Salah is out there, just runs his foot over the ball as he does as he moves in field,
[1465.64 - 1469.64] P:1681.79 E:0.095465 |  then gives a pass to Firmino, back to Salah, left for a shot, took a deflection.
[1470.64 - 1473.64] P:1798.05 E:0.109333 |  Off Aldervire Old, which took it further wide of the goal,
[1473.64 - 1478.64] P:1571.75 E:0.094037 |  and it's another Liverpool corner, and let's see if they crowd Larissa again.
[1478.64 - 1484.64] P:1652.32 E:0.093137 |  Again, it's a good driving run from Salah, off that right-hand side, links up,
[1484.64 - 1490.64] P:1799.54 E:0.086404 |  gets a shot off about 25 yards out, deflects wide of the goal.
[1491.64 - 1494.64] P:1830.03 E:0.094899 |  Looks like it's same again, John.
[1494.64 - 1497.64] P:1733.09 E:0.100585 |  They are walking with a sort of air of menace, aren't they?
[1497.64 - 1501.64] P:1662.86 E:0.090077 |  They've been strong at set pieces, it's a great chance for them there.
[1501.64 - 1505.64] P:1437.64 E:0.095530 |  Tottenham have got to really be diligent and really, really be alive here.
[1505.64 - 1509.64] P:1690.44 E:0.093248 |  Five men all around the Tottenham goalkeeper, Tottenham defenders in there as well.
[1509.64 - 1513.64] P:1607.35 E:0.086032 |  Alexander-Arnold with their delivery, Loris comes, gets a punch on it,
[1513.64 - 1520.64] P:1581.19 E:0.081122 |  this time a left fist, which takes it bouncing out into the hoardings on the far side for a throw in.
[1520.64 - 1522.64] P:1679.66 E:0.090039 |  He's dealt with it well, Larissa, two corners.
[1522.64 - 1526.64] P:1643.12 E:0.103670 |  They're asking questions, it looks like a round-in, but he's dealt with it well.
[1527.64 - 1531.64] P:1771.08 E:0.096297 |  One-nil Liverpool lead, throwing to Liverpool.
[1531.64 - 1537.64] P:1662.39 E:0.099043 |  Jordan Henderson just having a little word with referee Skamina, not sure what that was about.
[1537.64 - 1543.64] P:1534.57 E:0.100633 |  Just throwing to Liverpool, halfway inside the Tottenham half, already over 20 minutes played.
[1543.64 - 1547.64] P:1385.53 E:0.099590 |  Mohamed Salah's penalty, the difference between the sides.
[1547.64 - 1550.64] P:1319.96 E:0.105854 |  The throwing taken towards Salah in the box on the right-hand side,
[1550.64 - 1555.64] P:1555.75 E:0.098247 |  turns and shoots left-footed from an almost impossible angle, and actually it was so impossible.
[1555.64 - 1558.64] P:1542.82 E:0.089452 |  It's gone straight across the penalty area and bounced out for a throw in.
[1558.64 - 1563.64] P:1589.79 E:0.083854 |  You don't often see that from Mohamed Salah, a shot which goes out for a throw in.
[1563.64 - 1570.64] P:1713.07 E:0.094379 |  He uses his body so well, you can't get too tight to Salah, he feels for Tommen, good sharp turn.
[1570.64 - 1574.64] P:1432.42 E:0.086464 |  There's a skill in that mate, always good at finding the stand.
[1574.64 - 1579.64] P:1418.88 E:0.100934 |  Incidentally, not just out for a throw in, it was ten yards away from the cornerflip.
[1579.64 - 1583.64] P:1462.14 E:0.090759 |  Fomino into the box from the left-hand side, his little ball in field was read by for Tommen,
[1583.64 - 1588.64] P:1478.82 E:0.082420 |  who was able to move across and clear it away. Liverpool back in possession.
[1588.64 - 1596.64] P:1525.84 E:0.087170 |  Robertson, Fomino now, Manet with a flick, with the inside of his right foot out to the left.
[1596.64 - 1602.64] P:1605.41 E:0.110920 |  Find Alden, ball crossed from Robertson, looking for the arriving Salah, but Danny Rose got a touch to it.
[1602.64 - 1606.64] P:1621.10 E:0.108485 |  Such an important touch with his head, which took it flying out for a throw on the right.
[1606.64 - 1611.64] P:1578.97 E:0.097496 |  How many times has he on the money, Robertson, left-hand touch line, so many assists this season.
[1611.64 - 1613.64] P:1626.14 E:0.091323 |  Rose took up a good position.
[1613.64 - 1616.64] P:1381.44 E:0.085815 |  Same as we were saying about Ericsson, that's why I couldn't believe he turned it down.
[1616.64 - 1619.64] P:1596.22 E:0.096414 |  At the other end of the pitch, Trippier rolls it back, Ericsson's got the same shape as Robertson,
[1619.64 - 1623.64] P:1567.37 E:0.083831 |  Danny's right foot out, working the ball into the box with power.
[1623.64 - 1628.64] P:1426.59 E:0.088315 |  The ugly ball as they call it, Centre-Altes hate that, fizzing in, power, whip, horrible to deal with.
[1628.64 - 1632.64] P:1609.19 E:0.093419 |  Tottenham still penned back in there, defensive third, Son gave it away there.
[1632.64 - 1637.64] P:1547.86 E:0.089464 |  Liverpool coming again, Robertson to the left-hand side, the manage is drifting from right to left,
[1637.64 - 1641.64] P:1744.83 E:0.102504 |  towards the dead ball line, Trippier goes with him, Trippier's able to stick out a left leg
[1641.64 - 1643.64] P:1670.22 E:0.109278 |  and block it behind another Liverpool corner.
[1643.64 - 1651.64] P:1626.22 E:0.097503 |  Ericsson getting dragged back, doing a job defensively, but that match-up, Mane against Trippier.
[1651.64 - 1657.64] P:1608.51 E:0.094887 |  Liverpool, a lot of play down this left-hand side, Trippier stood up well there.
[1657.64 - 1662.64] P:1468.50 E:0.090644 |  Liverpool were in great form, coming into the end of the season as they chased Manchester City all the way.
[1662.64 - 1669.64] P:1580.95 E:0.093061 |  They've won 13 of their last 14 matches and actually this team, so just one change from the last league match of the season.
[1669.64 - 1674.64] P:1605.30 E:0.089223 |  Corner taken short this time to Henderson in the box, now Robertson swings it in from the left-hand side.
[1674.64 - 1679.64] P:1523.35 E:0.103306 |  That's headed away on the edge of the area and Robertson, as the two players turn,
[1679.64 - 1681.64] P:1514.83 E:0.111018 |  Kieran Trippier and Robertson together.
[1681.64 - 1687.64] P:1611.08 E:0.106544 |  Robertson, I'm not sure whether it's just a swinging arm that has caught Trippier,
[1687.64 - 1691.64] P:1610.78 E:0.094242 |  who just recoiled back and felt the ground clutching his face.
[1691.64 - 1700.64] P:1552.33 E:0.091530 |  Well, see the referee, it's a mean of having words with Robertson, he's just running, his arm catches Trippier.
[1700.64 - 1707.64] P:1604.28 E:0.087791 |  It's a natural movement, isn't it? He catches Trippier in the eye or in the nose.
[1707.64 - 1714.64] P:1476.06 E:0.079864 |  I mean, Trippier goes down, should he go down there? It was hardly vicious.
[1714.64 - 1718.64] P:1397.77 E:0.097567 |  It happened very close to the top technical area.
[1718.64 - 1723.64] P:1493.60 E:0.109141 |  Mauricio Pochettino, I think he must have said something because the referee's just paused play here
[1723.64 - 1730.64] P:1359.94 E:0.109418 |  and he is speaking quite animatedly with Mauricio Pochettino and then they pat one another on the chest and everything's all right.
[1730.64 - 1735.64] P:1518.62 E:0.097206 |  It just looked like that, Mauricio Pochettino, like he's losing his cool.
[1735.64 - 1740.64] P:1652.11 E:0.069999 |  If he angrived out, it was the early goal and he looks rattled.
[1740.64 - 1748.64] P:1699.55 E:0.089490 |  Not difficult in these conditions to lose your cool, Chris. You might need that jumper later though.
[1748.64 - 1752.64] P:1789.30 E:0.099224 |  Well, I was mocked earlier, wasn't I by Sean Giles and Robbie Savage,
[1752.64 - 1756.64] P:1834.88 E:0.094720 |  but I can assure the listeners, Chris, did tell us it could get freezing.
[1756.64 - 1759.64] P:1816.39 E:0.110190 |  We're actually freezing. We are quite high in this.
[1759.64 - 1761.64] P:1713.41 E:0.087672 |  I can assure you this is not going to get freezing like that.
[1761.64 - 1765.64] P:1733.13 E:0.090050 |  Quite high in the stand, but not that high. It's all relative.
[1765.64 - 1770.64] P:1647.36 E:0.099829 |  Cisoco just playing the ball back to goalkeeper, Lloris, in the penalty area to our left.
[1770.64 - 1773.64] P:1467.79 E:0.093609 |  Topman just keeping the ball inside their own half.
[1773.64 - 1778.64] P:1498.92 E:0.094729 |  Lloris goes a lot and Van Dijk is able to unchallenge, headed back towards the half-way line
[1778.64 - 1781.64] P:1637.81 E:0.093879 |  where Cisoco under pressure from Vain Alden,
[1781.64 - 1785.64] P:1485.54 E:0.089204 |  and then controls it out for a throw into Liverpool, 10 yards inside their own half.
[1785.64 - 1790.64] P:1425.15 E:0.102365 |  25 minutes played. You're listening to us on the World Service, BBC Radio 5 Live,
[1790.64 - 1796.64] P:1346.82 E:0.102834 |  BBC London and Radio Merseyside on a beautiful evening here in the northeast of Madrid.
[1796.64 - 1799.64] P:1366.39 E:0.082175 |  Throw in Robertson, takes it up the line.
[1799.64 - 1802.64] P:1398.30 E:0.087910 |  Trippie, who's recovered from that hand in the face,
[1802.64 - 1806.64] P:1469.84 E:0.090581 |  then Somme just can't bring the ball under control in the centre-circle.
[1806.64 - 1810.64] P:1459.62 E:0.086957 |  They'll go forward again, but then Cisoco is able to turn it,
[1810.64 - 1814.64] P:1516.73 E:0.087224 |  roll it back all the way to Hugo Lloris in the penalty area to our left.
[1814.64 - 1816.64] P:1446.43 E:0.096022 |  I think both managers are there a minute,
[1816.64 - 1819.64] P:1596.85 E:0.100390 |  but a little bit unsettled with too many turnovers, too many cheap turnovers,
[1819.64 - 1822.64] P:1262.05 E:0.095521 |  too many simple things going right, simple passes that are not finding the mark.
[1822.64 - 1824.64] P:1524.98 E:0.100149 |  Just up and again there, you know, too many turnovers,
[1824.64 - 1827.64] P:1435.64 E:0.088134 |  and I think both managers will be a bit disappointed with that so far.
[1827.64 - 1830.64] P:1497.24 E:0.095152 |  Yeah, 20 days since they last played a match,
[1830.64 - 1834.64] P:1413.67 E:0.100566 |  whether that's a factor or not, I don't know, whether the heat plays a part in that,
[1834.64 - 1836.64] P:1419.58 E:0.080263 |  but it has had that to it.
[1836.64 - 1839.64] P:1593.94 E:0.091112 |  Oh, yes, I think so, but you know, that time,
[1839.64 - 1846.64] P:1533.98 E:0.089095 |  those extra three weeks have allowed Tottenham to get key players fit for this game,
[1846.64 - 1849.64] P:1673.24 E:0.101977 |  so I don't think Spurs will be moaning about that too much.
[1849.64 - 1851.64] P:1608.41 E:0.091780 |  Liverpool, of course, for me, no fit.
[1851.64 - 1853.64] P:1373.24 E:0.105151 |  Harry Kane.
[1853.64 - 1856.64] P:1598.21 E:0.097851 |  Ball out towards the left-hand side.
[1856.64 - 1859.64] P:1686.93 E:0.093135 |  Fertonghen now rolls back towards Fertonghen.
[1859.64 - 1863.64] P:1417.58 E:0.096047 |  Alderviro is available on the edge of his penalty area.
[1863.64 - 1866.64] P:1609.50 E:0.104447 |  And then the Tottenham central defenders just exchanging passes,
[1866.64 - 1869.64] P:1595.17 E:0.103630 |  and then Firmino comes forward and closes down Alderviro.
[1869.64 - 1873.64] P:1510.93 E:0.102333 |  He has to go long and Trippia plays it on the volley into Robertson,
[1873.64 - 1877.64] P:1561.52 E:0.090161 |  and it bounces out of play next to Maritio Puccettino,
[1877.64 - 1880.64] P:1460.43 E:0.100398 |  who then has the ball thrown at him by a ball toy,
[1880.64 - 1882.64] P:1461.20 E:0.074481 |  and it hits him in the chest.
[1882.64 - 1887.64] P:1624.49 E:0.088339 |  Trippia has got a ball from somewhere, and he takes the throw.
[1887.64 - 1892.64] P:1514.84 E:0.096536 |  Alderviro again with Liverpool press here with Firmino,
[1892.64 - 1896.64] P:1483.93 E:0.089677 |  Fertonghen just angles it to Winx, now to Soko,
[1896.64 - 1898.64] P:1620.42 E:0.101798 |  Spurs still inside their own half.
[1898.64 - 1901.64] P:1463.12 E:0.104689 |  And then the long ball from Alderviro through the middle,
[1901.64 - 1904.64] P:1670.79 E:0.098550 |  Son on the chase running at an angle from left to right,
[1904.64 - 1907.64] P:1661.21 E:0.092297 |  takes the ball down, runs it out into the full-back position.
[1907.64 - 1910.64] P:1710.99 E:0.100801 |  I thought he looked offside, but he made the run.
[1910.64 - 1912.64] P:1656.62 E:0.062522 |  It was a tight one.
[1912.64 - 1915.64] P:1526.75 E:0.099547 |  You can see both sides, I like I say, because they're both pressing sides,
[1915.64 - 1917.64] P:1387.85 E:0.077797 |  they want to get on the front foot.
[1917.64 - 1920.64] P:1613.93 E:0.084245 |  The backfours got to come up, but you can see very effective both sides
[1920.64 - 1922.64] P:1585.50 E:0.080532 |  when they have lengthened the pitch.
[1922.64 - 1924.64] P:1400.05 E:0.087419 |  They have asked questions in behind the backfours.
[1924.64 - 1926.64] P:1491.67 E:0.078131 |  Very close there, very close to getting in top.
[1926.64 - 1929.64] P:1391.19 E:0.081818 |  1-0 Liverpool lead.
[1929.64 - 1933.64] P:1481.85 E:0.089914 |  Liverpool supporters in great heart here.
[1933.64 - 1936.64] P:1423.33 E:0.097728 |  16,000 more of them, more than that.
[1936.64 - 1939.64] P:1566.28 E:0.101540 |  Similar allocation for Tottenham as well to our left,
[1939.64 - 1942.64] P:1597.90 E:0.110927 |  so many white shirts, ball up towards Manet,
[1942.64 - 1945.64] P:1682.99 E:0.098222 |  who was challenged from behind by Alderviro.
[1945.64 - 1949.64] P:1632.44 E:0.084209 |  It's given as a free kick, Alderviro throws his arms up in the air,
[1949.64 - 1951.64] P:1441.73 E:0.085221 |  free kick to Liverpool, forward of the centre-circle.
[1951.64 - 1953.64] P:1423.42 E:0.080821 |  I think it was trippier on Manet.
[1953.64 - 1956.64] P:1443.48 E:0.087670 |  Diagonal ball from Alexander-Arnold,
[1956.64 - 1960.64] P:1536.48 E:0.091702 |  went inside his own half, wasn't the best of balls, fired into him.
[1960.64 - 1963.64] P:1526.72 E:0.091779 |  I think Liverpool got a little bit lucky there,
[1963.64 - 1966.64] P:1517.40 E:0.074141 |  looks off to me at the wall of the free kick.
[1966.64 - 1969.64] P:1214.24 E:0.099888 |  Free kick. Alexander-Arnold is over it.
[1969.64 - 1973.64] P:1514.00 E:0.093725 |  As I say, it's probably 10 yards ahead of the centre-circle,
[1973.64 - 1975.64] P:1501.08 E:0.080503 |  so it's a long, long way out.
[1975.64 - 1978.64] P:1580.37 E:0.085685 |  He's not going to shoot. He's not going to shoot, Sean.
[1978.64 - 1981.64] P:1597.48 E:0.103840 |  I think it's a long break-in short, and then Alexander-Arnold curls it in,
[1981.64 - 1984.64] P:1575.09 E:0.088280 |  and Sisoko moved towards it, jumped with it,
[1984.64 - 1987.64] P:1414.43 E:0.060133 |  but allowed it to go through for a goal kick.
[1987.64 - 1990.64] P:1394.77 E:0.089842 |  I wonder whether Sisoko got a touch on that,
[1990.64 - 1993.64] P:1512.74 E:0.079916 |  switched on, was alert.
[1994.64 - 1996.64] P:1517.25 E:0.104081 |  Almost half an hour played,
[1996.64 - 1999.64] P:1458.00 E:0.092060 |  and Liverpool leading through
[1999.64 - 2002.64] P:1577.35 E:0.099730 |  the penalty that was awarded after 23 seconds
[2002.64 - 2004.64] P:1424.37 E:0.093093 |  of the Champions League final,
[2004.64 - 2007.64] P:1502.40 E:0.098233 |  and Tottenham in a little bit of trouble at the back.
[2007.64 - 2009.64] P:1358.81 E:0.086196 |  I'm very surprised there.
[2009.64 - 2012.64] P:1314.88 E:0.083996 |  They've set the press there,
[2012.64 - 2015.64] P:1429.27 E:0.089337 |  and they're still fighting their way to get out of there.
[2015.64 - 2017.64] P:1500.40 E:0.102360 |  They've finally got out of there,
[2017.64 - 2020.64] P:1569.27 E:0.109665 |  but they're working every hard time just to get the ball out of their own half.
[2020.64 - 2023.64] P:1443.06 E:0.095082 |  They may have to mix their play a little bit more, even from goal kicks.
[2023.64 - 2025.64] P:1663.71 E:0.099440 |  Fabinho with a challenge on Kane.
[2025.64 - 2027.64] P:1481.27 E:0.095759 |  That's a foul, a little foul,
[2027.64 - 2029.64] P:1690.57 E:0.062123 |  and a free kick to Tottenham.
[2029.64 - 2032.64] P:1674.83 E:0.103108 |  Just when Tottenham were looking to break over the half-way line,
[2032.64 - 2034.64] P:1844.56 E:0.091828 |  Ericsson involved again.
[2034.64 - 2036.64] P:1753.21 E:0.094775 |  He's been involved in, well,
[2036.64 - 2040.64] P:1729.03 E:0.097819 |  the best of what Tottenham have been able to do so far in this final.
[2041.64 - 2044.64] P:1550.14 E:0.100475 |  Loris, long left-footed over the half-way line.
[2044.64 - 2046.64] P:1455.07 E:0.081770 |  Bancers off Matip.
[2046.64 - 2049.64] P:1495.68 E:0.093228 |  Van Dijk has to move across towards his left-hand side,
[2049.64 - 2052.64] P:1471.96 E:0.093267 |  and then scoops a pass that Robertson will do well to keep in.
[2052.64 - 2054.64] P:1667.07 E:0.094229 |  In fact, he can't reach it.
[2054.64 - 2057.64] P:1563.41 E:0.082996 |  Bancers out of play just next to Jürgen Klopp for a throw into Tottenham.
[2057.64 - 2060.64] P:1464.58 E:0.080045 |  Trippier was quickly on the scene, wanted to take a quick throw to Ericsson,
[2060.64 - 2062.64] P:1479.44 E:0.071121 |  but thinks twice.
[2062.64 - 2064.64] P:1546.96 E:0.093883 |  Kane plays it forward.
[2064.64 - 2068.64] P:1570.87 E:0.089643 |  That bounce was into the path of Van Dijk,
[2068.64 - 2071.64] P:1444.92 E:0.099567 |  who just clears it away downfield, and Tottenham have a throw.
[2071.64 - 2073.64] P:1438.13 E:0.072897 |  Very effective at some other in the play at the minute, Liverpool.
[2073.64 - 2075.64] P:1441.24 E:0.101500 |  You know, their distances are good, they're compact,
[2075.64 - 2077.64] P:1401.71 E:0.096544 |  they're breaking into the...
[2077.64 - 2079.64] P:1331.24 E:0.101263 |  You know, the main lines are passed.
[2079.64 - 2081.64] P:1391.43 E:0.088021 |  I know Tottenham want to get into the pockets, I want to get into.
[2081.64 - 2083.64] P:1495.14 E:0.090891 |  Doing a really good job at the minute, Liverpool.
[2083.64 - 2085.64] P:1240.80 E:0.099850 |  They're just containing Tottenham.
[2085.64 - 2088.64] P:1316.66 E:0.095681 |  Fine lines between them in the Premier League this season.
[2088.64 - 2090.64] P:1420.34 E:0.107096 |  Both matches finished 2-1 to Liverpool,
[2090.64 - 2093.64] P:1396.21 E:0.094968 |  but they were the winners at Wembley early in the season.
[2093.64 - 2097.64] P:1323.95 E:0.095767 |  But Tottenham gave them a real fright in the second half at least at Anfield.
[2097.64 - 2100.64] P:1519.70 E:0.096811 |  Here's Salah. Salah playing the ball through towards Firmino,
[2100.64 - 2103.64] P:1398.36 E:0.085745 |  but Aldervayrold was able to move into position
[2103.64 - 2107.64] P:1304.07 E:0.092453 |  and take the ball away from the Liverpool number nine.
[2107.64 - 2109.64] P:1395.62 E:0.078186 |  Tottenham still with the ball.
[2109.64 - 2112.64] P:1625.76 E:0.099678 |  In fact, the offside flag goes up and it's a free kick to Spurs.
[2112.64 - 2114.64] P:1545.01 E:0.092267 |  Halfway inside their own half.
[2114.64 - 2119.64] P:1532.30 E:0.091272 |  The 2019 Champions League final being 1-1 now by Liverpool.
[2121.64 - 2123.64] P:1707.37 E:0.090628 |  Trippia.
[2123.64 - 2125.64] P:1544.35 E:0.102906 |  Here's Harry Winks.
[2125.64 - 2128.64] P:1561.29 E:0.095787 |  Missed the last nine matches just like Harry Kane.
[2128.64 - 2132.64] P:1460.24 E:0.104850 |  Now Aldervayrold, who has played in a losing Champions League final
[2132.64 - 2134.64] P:1547.65 E:0.102346 |  for the team that plays in this stadium,
[2134.64 - 2139.64] P:1506.68 E:0.086454 |  Atletico Madrid, when they were beaten in the first of the all Madrid finals.
[2139.64 - 2142.64] P:1571.72 E:0.097522 |  We'll talk about an all-the-final between two English clubs.
[2142.64 - 2147.64] P:1533.06 E:0.092803 |  Of course, we've had two Champions League finals in recent years
[2147.64 - 2149.64] P:1627.12 E:0.100862 |  between two teams from this city.
[2149.64 - 2153.64] P:1544.46 E:0.107073 |  Here's Rose over the halfway line that plays the ball behind Son.
[2153.64 - 2155.64] P:1481.61 E:0.118582 |  Another little error.
[2155.64 - 2157.64] P:1609.64 E:0.100345 |  Too many unforced errors at the mid.
[2157.64 - 2159.64] P:1603.46 E:0.080344 |  Both sides, but particularly Tottenham.
[2159.64 - 2161.64] P:1444.16 E:0.075400 |  Too many moments like that.
[2161.64 - 2163.64] P:1451.48 E:0.076960 |  Simple moments to build something into the game.
[2163.64 - 2166.64] P:1395.29 E:0.082939 |  To build to be effective, to get in the top third with quality.
[2166.64 - 2168.64] P:1493.93 E:0.089996 |  Too many at the moment.
[2168.64 - 2170.64] P:1389.83 E:0.086798 |  He did well initially. Rose knocked the ball around Henderson,
[2170.64 - 2172.64] P:1282.59 E:0.085548 |  left-hand side.
[2172.64 - 2175.64] P:1452.68 E:0.089098 |  Just a really poor pass. Goes out for Throw into Liverpool.
[2176.64 - 2178.64] P:1474.91 E:0.106552 |  Throw into Liverpool.
[2178.64 - 2180.64] P:1289.23 E:0.070964 |  And then, the final.
[2180.64 - 2182.64] P:1530.51 E:0.106134 |  Fine Aldervayrold plays it back to Alexander-Arnold,
[2182.64 - 2185.64] P:1575.88 E:0.104440 |  who just hits the ball rather aimlessly to Cisoco in the centre-circle.
[2185.64 - 2189.64] P:1681.56 E:0.097584 |  And Cisoco is able to drive on so close to Cisoco
[2189.64 - 2192.64] P:1609.63 E:0.086903 |  to finding the pass diagonally to Son,
[2192.64 - 2194.64] P:1736.85 E:0.111434 |  but Matic was in just the right place.
[2194.64 - 2198.64] P:1792.73 E:0.100211 |  You say that, but Alexander-Arnold's error came from a really poor pass
[2198.64 - 2200.64] P:1752.64 E:0.084845 |  back from Wijnaldum.
[2200.64 - 2202.64] P:1743.06 E:0.092469 |  Ericsson now for Tottenham.
[2202.64 - 2204.64] P:1739.08 E:0.091493 |  Rolls it to the left-hand side to Danny Rose.
[2204.64 - 2206.64] P:1765.06 E:0.092541 |  Blue boots, quick steps,
[2206.64 - 2208.64] P:1654.76 E:0.105546 |  and he gets the movement that he wanted there.
[2208.64 - 2210.64] P:1728.94 E:0.099379 |  Danny Rose, who's berating his team-mates
[2210.64 - 2212.64] P:1749.64 E:0.091181 |  and has to play it back towards the halfway line.
[2212.64 - 2216.64] P:1688.86 E:0.091870 |  Now Harry Winks turns on the ball, plays it centrally to Deli Alley.
[2216.64 - 2219.64] P:1685.16 E:0.092993 |  A flick from him. Harry Kane takes it up.
[2219.64 - 2222.64] P:1758.05 E:0.102350 |  Then back towards the halfway line to Winks.
[2222.64 - 2224.64] P:1666.93 E:0.126879 |  Winks passes it behind.
[2224.64 - 2226.64] P:1611.13 E:0.109507 |  Trippie, it's another error.
[2226.64 - 2228.64] P:1624.94 E:0.094652 |  Passed out of play by Harry Winks this time.
[2228.64 - 2230.64] P:1450.44 E:0.095473 |  Another really poor pass.
[2230.64 - 2234.64] P:1594.23 E:0.100780 |  And Trippie is the out-ball because Liverpool's back for a so narrow.
[2234.64 - 2236.64] P:1561.49 E:0.079162 |  But Trippie are hugging the touch line,
[2236.64 - 2239.64] P:1515.95 E:0.084669 |  but that was awful, awful.
[2239.64 - 2241.64] P:1478.88 E:0.088689 |  Manager Putsch-Saino was really frustrated at the minute.
[2241.64 - 2244.64] P:1445.66 E:0.098217 |  Just from the simple pass, the game was set before the game.
[2244.64 - 2246.64] P:1417.18 E:0.099703 |  What would I tell the players? They built on the basics.
[2246.64 - 2248.64] P:1592.01 E:0.109786 |  Do the basics well.
[2248.64 - 2250.64] P:1627.00 E:0.110144 |  Deli Alley gets away into the penalty area on the right-hand side.
[2250.64 - 2252.64] P:1720.40 E:0.096747 |  Still going, plays the ball across.
[2252.64 - 2255.64] P:1657.07 E:0.102556 |  Actually tried to play it through the legs, I think, of Matic,
[2255.64 - 2259.64] P:1603.43 E:0.109109 |  and it caught the right leg and bounced behind for a Tottenham corner,
[2259.64 - 2263.64] P:1670.53 E:0.093900 |  which Winks, which Alley is going to take quickly, he does, to Trippie.
[2263.64 - 2265.64] P:1642.03 E:0.092367 |  Trippie looks up, curls it in towards the near post.
[2265.64 - 2268.64] P:1599.99 E:0.091148 |  Thine Alden was there in position to head it out
[2268.64 - 2272.64] P:1538.47 E:0.110193 |  and back towards the right-hand side where it bounces out of play for a throw in.
[2272.64 - 2274.64] P:1485.18 E:0.098000 |  Just over 10 minutes to go to half-time.
[2274.64 - 2278.64] P:1386.48 E:0.089298 |  Liverpool leading through the early Salah penalty.
[2278.64 - 2285.64] P:1296.57 E:0.107128 |  Trippie just holding the ball, the Champions League final ball
[2285.64 - 2289.64] P:1244.15 E:0.109931 |  with its white stars and orange background above his head.
[2289.64 - 2292.64] P:1260.02 E:0.081049 |  Trippie takes the throw.
[2292.64 - 2295.64] P:1479.37 E:0.092030 |  Ericsson near the corner flag, down here to the right.
[2295.64 - 2299.64] P:1583.55 E:0.094834 |  Robertson is able to get a pull to it to touch it out of play
[2299.64 - 2302.64] P:1532.80 E:0.095616 |  and it's a throw in to Tottenham five yards back from the corner flag.
[2302.64 - 2305.64] P:1672.32 E:0.093044 |  Again, Trippie. Winks is at close quarters.
[2305.64 - 2307.64] P:1632.98 E:0.091203 |  Trippie loops a throw in towards Kane.
[2307.64 - 2310.64] P:1501.64 E:0.094868 |  That's won by Van Dijk against Kane.
[2310.64 - 2312.64] P:1509.19 E:0.119937 |  And now Tottenham win it back.
[2312.64 - 2317.64] P:1541.05 E:0.096850 |  Trippie, Tottenham finds feeling that he might have felled for Meno there,
[2317.64 - 2320.64] P:1420.28 E:0.092872 |  but it's not given that way and Tottenham still have possession,
[2320.64 - 2323.64] P:1347.18 E:0.096747 |  deep inside their own half with the central defenders.
[2323.64 - 2325.64] P:1303.78 E:0.107040 |  Fertongan wanted to hit that quickly,
[2325.64 - 2328.64] P:1311.24 E:0.103833 |  but felt that Trippie wasn't ready for it.
[2328.64 - 2331.64] P:1354.39 E:0.102265 |  And again, there's little reaction from a Tottenham man,
[2331.64 - 2334.64] P:1418.25 E:0.103540 |  this time waving his arms in the direction of Trippie.
[2334.64 - 2337.64] P:1306.42 E:0.105481 |  Salah made it there. Look at the four bucks for Tottenham.
[2337.64 - 2341.64] P:1470.35 E:0.104284 |  High, very high, wide, and they've got the three coming inside now.
[2341.64 - 2344.64] P:1435.35 E:0.111195 |  You know, joining in with or hoping to join in with Kane.
[2344.64 - 2346.64] P:1672.43 E:0.103399 |  Look at Sons position, look at Ericsson's position.
[2346.64 - 2349.64] P:1450.28 E:0.104152 |  Really trying to force their Salah in to get nearer to Kane.
[2349.64 - 2351.64] P:1485.28 E:0.101434 |  Ten minutes to go to halftime, plus added time.
[2351.64 - 2354.64] P:1447.75 E:0.108917 |  Here's Henderson, the Liverpool captain on the right as well.
[2354.64 - 2357.64] P:1416.19 E:0.087433 |  Gets around the defender, but his cross is too deep,
[2357.64 - 2359.64] P:1598.78 E:0.094224 |  and in actual fact, swung out of play
[2359.64 - 2363.64] P:1589.65 E:0.097730 |  according to the assistant on the far side, so it's a goal kick to Tottenham.
[2363.64 - 2367.64] P:1535.26 E:0.088231 |  Paul Diagonal ball from Trippie up, but Liverpool, their shape,
[2367.64 - 2370.64] P:1755.01 E:0.089111 |  they're just sitting in, Sean, waiting to pounce on.
[2370.64 - 2374.64] P:1554.64 E:0.098656 |  In really, really good distances. They're alive, they're alert,
[2374.64 - 2377.64] P:1537.88 E:0.089894 |  they're coming out of the sauce, obviously the early goal helps enormously.
[2377.64 - 2380.64] P:1361.54 E:0.102046 |  It's so difficult, Tottenham works that out, they're opening up,
[2380.64 - 2383.64] P:1448.55 E:0.083674 |  they want to play, they want to open up the pockets,
[2383.64 - 2386.64] P:1406.75 E:0.100515 |  but when Liverpool get it and they work on count, they can be devastating.
[2386.64 - 2390.64] P:1391.35 E:0.109640 |  Tottenham, we've got to do it, don't get around to break Liverpool down,
[2390.64 - 2391.64] P:1366.16 E:0.099020 |  but it is a big risk.
[2391.64 - 2394.64] P:1405.80 E:0.090360 |  Remember how Tottenham came on strong at Anfield in the second half,
[2394.64 - 2398.64] P:1524.28 E:0.095576 |  Delhi Ali, clicking the ball forward, but that will just run through to Alisson,
[2398.64 - 2403.64] P:1582.95 E:0.092037 |  the Liverpool goalkeeper who is able to pick it up quite comfortably.
[2403.64 - 2409.64] P:1404.16 E:0.090328 |  And actually, for once, just walks forward calmly with it,
[2409.64 - 2413.64] P:1443.60 E:0.087763 |  bounces it a couple of times, the bearded Liverpool goalkeeper,
[2413.64 - 2417.64] P:1445.93 E:0.090134 |  who's another who's made a big, big difference to this Liverpool team.
[2417.64 - 2420.64] P:1495.06 E:0.114481 |  And just as I talk him up, he launches the ball straight out of play,
[2420.64 - 2424.64] P:1448.61 E:0.092511 |  about ten yards above the head of Robertson for a throw into Tottenham.
[2424.64 - 2429.64] P:1334.53 E:0.083157 |  Here's Trippie, who plays it back to his goalkeeper, Lloris,
[2429.64 - 2431.64] P:1173.36 E:0.084822 |  who was beaten by the Salah penalty.
[2431.64 - 2435.64] P:1451.14 E:0.086940 |  As I say, it was quite close too, it was just a couple of feet above him.
[2435.64 - 2439.64] P:1729.92 E:0.095905 |  He gambled, we can't blame the keeper for that.
[2439.64 - 2442.64] P:1781.22 E:0.092890 |  Salah just hit him so cleanly, didn't be.
[2442.64 - 2445.64] P:1773.89 E:0.102182 |  Quite a big wind-up, as you said, Chris, for the penalty,
[2445.64 - 2450.64] P:1544.91 E:0.086979 |  stepped out wide to the right-hand side, came in, but struck it so well.
[2450.64 - 2452.64] P:1563.51 E:0.085163 |  Not a rugby kicker.
[2452.64 - 2457.64] P:1481.47 E:0.077985 |  Liverpool, ball in the Tottenham defence of third, but over on the far side.
[2457.64 - 2460.64] P:1537.87 E:0.100289 |  Salah has two Tottenham players with him,
[2460.64 - 2463.64] P:1594.40 E:0.092491 |  and the ball's deflected back onto Salah and out of play
[2463.64 - 2466.64] P:1459.25 E:0.073131 |  for a throw-in to Tottenham, half way inside,
[2466.64 - 2469.64] P:1268.69 E:0.092930 |  or deep inside their own half on the far side,
[2469.64 - 2474.64] P:1425.15 E:0.089055 |  that Danny Rose is going to take next to a Tottenham flag from Nunnitan.
[2474.64 - 2478.64] P:1411.26 E:0.087361 |  The banners actually are a real feature at both ends.
[2478.64 - 2481.64] P:1388.34 E:0.097001 |  There are some great little messages on them that are hanging from all
[2481.64 - 2484.64] P:1377.39 E:0.088458 |  of the various points around the ground,
[2484.64 - 2488.64] P:1467.97 E:0.087778 |  where the supporters have been allowed to hang the flags and banners.
[2488.64 - 2491.64] P:1396.75 E:0.090444 |  Liverpool with the ball inside their own half.
[2491.64 - 2497.64] P:1452.05 E:0.082295 |  Robertson turns it back to Allyson, who will pass it out towards Matip,
[2497.64 - 2500.64] P:1685.96 E:0.106892 |  who flicks the ball here to Robertson, great pass.
[2500.64 - 2502.64] P:1730.14 E:0.109692 |  And Robertson has space now.
[2502.64 - 2506.64] P:1610.74 E:0.100890 |  He's looking to capitalise on that and takes it up towards the edge of the area,
[2506.64 - 2510.64] P:1666.59 E:0.111953 |  and shoots, and Loris, it was just above his head,
[2510.64 - 2514.64] P:1678.22 E:0.108975 |  but I think that was moving both at pace and from side to side,
[2514.64 - 2516.64] P:1647.48 E:0.100340 |  and he touched it over the bar.
[2516.64 - 2519.64] P:1661.07 E:0.095015 |  What a play, what a season he has had.
[2519.64 - 2521.64] P:1458.66 E:0.105109 |  But let me tell you, the pass out from Matip,
[2521.64 - 2525.64] P:1672.94 E:0.101801 |  he was under all sorts of pressure from Sont, was sublime,
[2525.64 - 2527.64] P:1443.03 E:0.092121 |  Crossfield, ball from right to left,
[2527.64 - 2530.64] P:1606.52 E:0.083858 |  and Robertson just kept going and going,
[2530.64 - 2532.64] P:1814.31 E:0.085509 |  giving the space, and he hammers the shot,
[2532.64 - 2536.64] P:1640.27 E:0.081377 |  and Loris did make the save, should have made the save, tipped it over.
[2536.64 - 2539.64] P:1632.42 E:0.084879 |  It's a corner to Liverpool, it's the fourth one they've had,
[2539.64 - 2541.64] P:1753.70 E:0.086654 |  but it's the first one from the right-hand side.
[2541.64 - 2544.64] P:1650.45 E:0.082800 |  So this time, with Alexander-Arnold hitting the out-swinging corner,
[2544.64 - 2547.64] P:1676.38 E:0.086352 |  they're not crowding Loris, they're near the penalty spot,
[2547.64 - 2549.64] P:1618.81 E:0.105152 |  ball into the near post, Sont heads it out,
[2549.64 - 2552.64] P:1691.38 E:0.099620 |  and then Salah was underneath it, just on the edge of the D.
[2552.64 - 2554.64] P:1539.27 E:0.078287 |  He caught that well as well,
[2554.64 - 2557.64] P:1577.36 E:0.088045 |  but he's landed at half-way up the lower tier of the Tottenham fans.
[2557.64 - 2559.64] P:1494.30 E:0.087694 |  They don't often say this, mind the windows, Moe.
[2559.64 - 2561.64] P:1400.55 E:0.068045 |  That was horrible, wasn't it?
[2561.64 - 2563.64] P:1426.44 E:0.082865 |  Right-footed volley,
[2563.64 - 2568.64] P:1502.14 E:0.084695 |  Vatonlin, worryingly for Spurs, has gone down, holding his left arm.
[2568.64 - 2570.64] P:1152.11 E:0.090713 |  So what's happened there, then?
[2572.64 - 2577.64] P:1398.47 E:0.103381 |  Vatonlin is crouching down in his own penalty area,
[2577.64 - 2582.64] P:1387.74 E:0.095037 |  and the medical people are on, he's down on one knee,
[2582.64 - 2588.64] P:1391.08 E:0.087136 |  and now stands up, and is it a finger, perhaps?
[2588.64 - 2589.64] P:1418.67 E:0.109329 |  It's a bit difficult to tell.
[2589.64 - 2592.64] P:1329.25 E:0.085482 |  Left elbow, isn't it? Left arm?
[2592.64 - 2594.64] P:1212.19 E:0.105039 |  Yeah, it's his lower left arm,
[2594.64 - 2597.64] P:1348.38 E:0.089651 |  and the physio is holding his left elbow,
[2597.64 - 2600.64] P:1254.85 E:0.086535 |  and manipulating his left wrist.
[2600.64 - 2602.64] P:1516.88 E:0.082305 |  And Vatonlin looks as though he's in some pain,
[2602.64 - 2606.64] P:1463.45 E:0.089365 |  and he's got his fingers pinching the bridge of his nose.
[2606.64 - 2612.64] P:1324.38 E:0.078830 |  And we're just seeing a replay now, when...
[2612.64 - 2616.64] P:1536.14 E:0.105180 |  He's competing for the ball, the corner comes in,
[2616.64 - 2620.64] P:1391.05 E:0.085051 |  and Alden gets the run on him, and you can see him now.
[2620.64 - 2623.64] P:1460.66 E:0.086577 |  His face is in a lot of pain.
[2624.64 - 2627.64] P:1143.84 E:0.108053 |  I think he's going to be all right, I think he's funny, both.
[2627.64 - 2630.64] P:1145.09 E:0.095306 |  We all know what a pain in the hand is.
[2630.64 - 2633.64] P:1266.80 E:0.095585 |  Elbow. Yes, of course.
[2633.64 - 2634.64] P:1133.76 E:0.105822 |  Exactly what a man.
[2634.64 - 2636.64] P:1599.63 E:0.106068 |  That's our medical expert, Sean Dice.
[2638.64 - 2640.64] P:1167.56 E:0.124980 |  Thanks for what you've been here for two years.
[2640.64 - 2641.64] P:1427.88 E:0.119224 |  I was just going to say...
[2641.64 - 2643.64] P:1343.20 E:0.103685 |  It feels like it'd be in review, anyway.
[2643.64 - 2647.64] P:1353.74 E:0.089031 |  Yeah, Sean, welcome to a five-live commentary with Chris Sutton.
[2647.64 - 2650.64] P:1205.19 E:0.107754 |  The ball's out of play for a goal kick,
[2650.64 - 2652.64] P:1499.88 E:0.095566 |  and yeah, Vatonlin's going to be OK,
[2652.64 - 2654.64] P:1253.58 E:0.098922 |  but he's sprinting back towards the halfway line,
[2654.64 - 2656.64] P:1285.91 E:0.102747 |  and he's now straight back onto the field.
[2656.64 - 2659.64] P:1417.21 E:0.102514 |  So 1-0 Liverpool lead, half-time approaching.
[2659.64 - 2662.64] P:1430.51 E:0.104538 |  Henderson playing a high ball over the top towards Mane,
[2662.64 - 2667.64] P:1463.06 E:0.097592 |  who is able to move away from Trippia, who is very tight on him.
[2667.64 - 2670.64] P:1475.01 E:0.088250 |  But they're together now in the Tottenham right back area.
[2670.64 - 2674.64] P:1604.97 E:0.085244 |  Mane then found winks on the scene as well,
[2674.64 - 2675.64] P:1206.06 E:0.087317 |  so played it back to Robertson,
[2675.64 - 2676.64] P:1664.16 E:0.099094 |  he angles up all in field,
[2676.64 - 2678.64] P:1514.19 E:0.089521 |  and now Van Alden just outside the box,
[2678.64 - 2681.64] P:1570.25 E:0.082754 |  Salah flicked it, but didn't get enough of a flick on it.
[2681.64 - 2684.64] P:1620.77 E:0.096036 |  To Mane, and so-called, is able to arrive,
[2684.64 - 2687.64] P:1594.62 E:0.087524 |  and with both legs, block it out for a throw in.
[2687.64 - 2690.64] P:1439.70 E:0.096114 |  See Mane on every or virtually every time it turns over the middle,
[2690.64 - 2692.64] P:1477.22 E:0.083537 |  he drives at Trippia, he's driving at it,
[2692.64 - 2696.64] P:1464.96 E:0.090839 |  trying to get him behind him, trying to, you know, disrupt Trippia
[2696.64 - 2697.64] P:1500.21 E:0.084519 |  with his pace and his power.
[2697.64 - 2700.64] P:1358.72 E:0.085991 |  Robertson takes the throw, a little stooping header by Firmino,
[2700.64 - 2704.64] P:1367.27 E:0.096747 |  back to Robertson, who loses to Son, and now Ericsson, and Son.
[2704.64 - 2707.64] P:1619.15 E:0.096859 |  Son running across field, but he's lost possession.
[2707.64 - 2709.64] P:1718.83 E:0.103424 |  Henderson with a chance to shoot, it's deflected,
[2709.64 - 2713.64] P:1721.38 E:0.107141 |  back to Firmino in the D, Firmino trying to find a shooting position.
[2713.64 - 2715.64] P:1703.39 E:0.103377 |  A cross came Alderviral, so he uses Henderson,
[2715.64 - 2717.64] P:1585.17 E:0.093508 |  then plays it out to the right-hand side,
[2717.64 - 2718.64] P:1527.80 E:0.110383 |  here's the cross from Alexander-Arnold,
[2718.64 - 2720.64] P:1645.11 E:0.101301 |  which hits the defend at Danny Rose,
[2720.64 - 2723.64] P:1603.38 E:0.101867 |  and bounces straight behind for Liverpool corner.
[2723.64 - 2728.64] P:1535.40 E:0.091237 |  Just wondered, he'd dwell on it too long, Firmino had the chance
[2728.64 - 2733.64] P:1627.11 E:0.084494 |  to get the shot off, took too long, and Smerz smothered out
[2733.64 - 2735.64] P:1340.04 E:0.083823 |  for a corner to Liverpool.
[2735.64 - 2737.64] P:1568.38 E:0.079562 |  Oh, Smerz are not playing.
[2737.64 - 2740.64] P:1550.41 E:0.090344 |  An awful game of Smerz, Tadda.
[2740.64 - 2743.64] P:1506.91 E:0.090834 |  I had a feeling you weren't going to let him get away with that.
[2743.64 - 2745.64] P:1651.11 E:0.107360 |  Corner then, Alexander-Arnold to the near post,
[2745.64 - 2747.64] P:1507.13 E:0.089774 |  that's headed away, four-tot number two,
[2747.64 - 2749.64] P:1495.28 E:0.097014 |  Liverpool players near, it's Salleh hits a shot,
[2749.64 - 2753.64] P:1571.69 E:0.101337 |  but Ranna sliced that, and I think it took a deflection as well.
[2753.64 - 2755.64] P:1756.21 E:0.105875 |  Larisse scamper to his right.
[2755.64 - 2756.64] P:1728.44 E:0.093796 |  It's got to do better than that.
[2756.64 - 2760.64] P:1549.82 E:0.094480 |  Premier League seven direct contacts for goals.
[2760.64 - 2761.64] P:1385.91 E:0.083304 |  Liverpool.
[2761.64 - 2764.64] P:1432.27 E:0.100922 |  Each time this happens, if they get the right quality in that,
[2764.64 - 2766.64] P:1435.25 E:0.093131 |  they have got goals in them from corners.
[2766.64 - 2768.64] P:1536.55 E:0.104954 |  He should have kept that in the goal seed, but Larisse,
[2768.64 - 2772.64] P:1688.61 E:0.091973 |  it was a volley, a half volley, and Salleh took a deflection.
[2772.64 - 2774.64] P:1530.94 E:0.094659 |  And the spinning ball, it had too much spin on it
[2774.64 - 2777.64] P:1626.33 E:0.095802 |  for the Tottenham goalkeeper, who fumbled it behind for a corner.
[2777.64 - 2780.64] P:1576.14 E:0.083859 |  Salleh's going to take this one to the near post,
[2780.64 - 2784.64] P:1587.32 E:0.074731 |  but Sane hooks it away on the volley with his right foot,
[2784.64 - 2787.64] P:1558.29 E:0.075910 |  and it bounces out of play, or at least Robertson makes sure
[2787.64 - 2790.64] P:1609.31 E:0.087140 |  it bounces out of play with Ericsson not far away.
[2790.64 - 2792.64] P:1709.20 E:0.096103 |  Liverpool finishing the first half strongly here,
[2792.64 - 2794.64] P:1517.94 E:0.094040 |  leading by one goal to nil.
[2794.64 - 2797.64] P:1435.67 E:0.087397 |  We've got two and a half minutes of the first 45 of this 2019
[2797.64 - 2799.64] P:1494.90 E:0.088545 |  Champions League final to play.
[2799.64 - 2802.64] P:1513.50 E:0.102326 |  You're listening to it on the BBC, BBC Radio, Five Live,
[2802.64 - 2805.64] P:1329.21 E:0.099252 |  the World Service, BBC London, and Radio Merseyside
[2805.64 - 2807.64] P:1320.81 E:0.096477 |  are all with us this evening.
[2807.64 - 2812.64] P:1308.39 E:0.102795 |  So, millions and millions of listeners to the radio,
[2812.64 - 2815.64] P:1338.33 E:0.109446 |  and as Mauricio Pochettino said yesterday,
[2815.64 - 2817.64] P:1448.52 E:0.093639 |  a billion watching on television.
[2817.64 - 2819.64] P:1380.98 E:0.100224 |  Liverpool with the ball in from the right-hand side,
[2819.64 - 2822.64] P:1449.81 E:0.081681 |  blocked on the edge of the box by Alderweyrod.
[2822.64 - 2829.64] P:1406.53 E:0.106379 |  And then Liverpool concede a free kick ten yards inside their own half,
[2829.64 - 2832.64] P:1520.33 E:0.090762 |  and it's going to be taken quickly by Wink looking for the ball
[2832.64 - 2834.64] P:1514.47 E:0.090505 |  over the top through the middle.
[2834.64 - 2836.64] P:1530.59 E:0.088680 |  Matip was in position to head it away.
[2836.64 - 2840.64] P:1612.50 E:0.103227 |  Harry Kane holds off and Dyke, but goes to ground, no free kick,
[2840.64 - 2843.64] P:1564.55 E:0.114578 |  and Alexander-Arnold whips the ball away downfield.
[2843.64 - 2847.64] P:1632.93 E:0.093883 |  This is for Salleh to chase, but Fertonga got there first,
[2847.64 - 2849.64] P:1627.01 E:0.090020 |  played it with his right foot back to Laurie,
[2849.64 - 2853.64] P:1646.43 E:0.097886 |  but Laurie sits kept in by a leaping Danny Rose with his head on the far side,
[2853.64 - 2856.64] P:1579.75 E:0.094842 |  and Tottenham will pass it away from inside their own half,
[2856.64 - 2860.64] P:1648.60 E:0.107306 |  and in fact, Rose rolls the pass forward to Son on the left-hand side,
[2860.64 - 2863.64] P:1758.80 E:0.106744 |  and it is three against three, as Tottenham come forward,
[2863.64 - 2867.64] P:1624.67 E:0.114877 |  but the ball is all by hit by Deli Aie, 3,000.
[2867.64 - 2869.64] P:1690.87 E:0.100520 |  Too many unforced errors from Tottenham.
[2869.64 - 2872.64] P:1513.80 E:0.101488 |  We're talking very high-quality technical players.
[2872.64 - 2874.64] P:1525.09 E:0.097571 |  They were so frustrated that the manager
[2874.64 - 2877.64] P:1381.21 E:0.090722 |  will have too many unforced errors for players of this level in the market.
[2877.64 - 2881.64] P:1481.97 E:0.090336 |  Yeah, it's a disappointing feature of this Champions League final so far.
[2881.64 - 2883.64] P:1413.70 E:0.080427 |  Yeah, I think you're right.
[2883.64 - 2887.64] P:1546.38 E:0.082956 |  I don't think it was the most difficult pass in Deli Aie,
[2887.64 - 2890.64] P:1448.83 E:0.100176 |  but to miss it by that far and allow Allyson to gather,
[2890.64 - 2897.64] P:1450.40 E:0.079588 |  and quite frankly, this first half, Allyson, I don't think he's had a save to make.
[2897.64 - 2901.64] P:1232.75 E:0.094766 |  They've not made a single nilt of that nature.
[2901.64 - 2903.64] P:1207.55 E:0.094722 |  The ball was played forward for Liverpool,
[2903.64 - 2906.64] P:1552.30 E:0.101939 |  but Mane took a stumble there or a slip,
[2906.64 - 2908.64] P:1489.75 E:0.095269 |  or under pressure from Trippia.
[2908.64 - 2911.64] P:1362.34 E:0.112730 |  Anyway, he ended up on the ground, and Tottenham have got the ball back.
[2911.64 - 2913.64] P:1525.45 E:0.096292 |  We're in the last minute of the first 45.
[2913.64 - 2915.64] P:1316.46 E:0.099188 |  Now, we had to go right at the end.
[2915.64 - 2918.64] P:1527.94 E:0.106340 |  We had to go right at the start of this half for Liverpool,
[2918.64 - 2920.64] P:1764.31 E:0.104168 |  and Tottenham coming forward.
[2920.64 - 2926.64] P:1542.35 E:0.091166 |  Robertson is able to get his foot to it and hook it out of play for a throw-in.
[2926.64 - 2928.64] P:1645.71 E:0.111036 |  The fourth official has just come forward with the ball.
[2928.64 - 2932.64] P:1603.12 E:0.093178 |  He did flash the number, and I think it might have been a two.
[2932.64 - 2934.64] P:1566.69 E:0.090990 |  He has Tottenham's number two,
[2934.64 - 2937.64] P:1483.42 E:0.093347 |  with a throw-in 15 yards inside the Liverpool half.
[2937.64 - 2942.64] P:1464.93 E:0.093781 |  Ericsson comes across, back to Trippia, then into the centre-circle.
[2942.64 - 2945.64] P:1528.67 E:0.112557 |  Firmino unsettles the Tongan, but the ball bounces, forces so good.
[2945.64 - 2949.64] P:1631.88 E:0.097387 |  It is two minutes of added time being played at the end of this first period.
[2949.64 - 2952.64] P:1599.32 E:0.108666 |  Now on the right-hand side, Son moves away from Robertson.
[2952.64 - 2955.64] P:1631.65 E:0.105743 |  Son plays it across, Dalli Alley touches it back to Ericsson.
[2955.64 - 2958.64] P:1555.89 E:0.118881 |  It's opening up for Ericsson, but he's left foot short.
[2958.64 - 2962.64] P:1641.54 E:0.109465 |  His hit horribly high over the crossbar and into the Liverpool fans.
[2962.64 - 2965.64] P:1522.53 E:0.099673 |  They worked it really well.
[2965.64 - 2969.64] P:1514.70 E:0.097479 |  It was an opportunity to let the ball go to the left-hand side for Rose,
[2969.64 - 2976.64] P:1605.09 E:0.090215 |  but when Ericsson gets within 20-22 yards of the goal and has a free shot,
[2976.64 - 2980.64] P:1636.14 E:0.088195 |  you certainly expect the goalkeeper to be worked left-footed.
[2980.64 - 2983.64] P:1381.66 E:0.083186 |  At least that little reminder at the top of what you know.
[2983.64 - 2986.64] P:1410.62 E:0.094235 |  A little pocket of play, filling the sort of deal, the box,
[2986.64 - 2991.64] P:1427.67 E:0.096219 |  with players in quality positions and trying to break out wide all, get a fix at goal.
[2991.64 - 2997.64] P:1452.92 E:0.079896 |  One nil to Liverpool, Tottenham with the ball on the edge of their own penalty area again.
[2997.64 - 3000.64] P:1654.91 E:0.082172 |  Final seconds of the first half.
[3000.64 - 3005.64] P:1688.54 E:0.095495 |  This second Champions League final between two English clubs.
[3005.64 - 3011.64] P:1653.37 E:0.090720 |  Trippie hits the ball downfield, Mattip got his head to it, van Dijk hikes it.
[3011.64 - 3014.64] P:1601.79 E:0.106057 |  Straight out of play for a throw-in to Tottenham.
[3014.64 - 3017.64] P:1607.18 E:0.093448 |  It's just changing the feel a little bit, asking a different question,
[3017.64 - 3020.64] P:1667.64 E:0.093600 |  stretching the midfield of Liverpool, just asking a question.
[3020.64 - 3024.64] P:1727.74 E:0.091088 |  They're going to take off second ball sometimes, as well as the beauty playing through the third.
[3024.64 - 3027.64] P:1833.67 E:0.114386 |  Trippie after the throw-in back to Sissoko.
[3027.64 - 3030.64] P:1871.41 E:0.103299 |  We've got 30 seconds of added time left.
[3030.64 - 3032.64] P:1861.55 E:0.095264 |  The whistles are Liverpool whistles.
[3032.64 - 3036.64] P:1830.71 E:0.108282 |  They want to see their team going in with the lead at half-time here in Madrid.
[3036.64 - 3039.64] P:1726.04 E:0.100171 |  Tottenham with Winks, then Rose on the left-hand side,
[3039.64 - 3044.64] P:1679.09 E:0.099944 |  and now Deli Alli out on the left flank, and then it's worked across by Winks,
[3044.64 - 3046.64] P:1547.20 E:0.100091 |  but cut out at the near post by Mattip.
[3046.64 - 3049.64] P:1486.55 E:0.100373 |  Alexander-Arnold then comes in with a challenge, wins it back.
[3049.64 - 3053.64] P:1586.56 E:0.100295 |  He's claiming that Alexander-Arnold carried it out, an overly dead-ball line,
[3053.64 - 3057.64] P:1618.78 E:0.079471 |  but the assistant on the other side didn't feel that,
[3057.64 - 3061.64] P:1594.76 E:0.092535 |  and it's out of play for a throw-in to Tottenham near the halfway line.
[3061.64 - 3066.64] P:1679.76 E:0.109052 |  So one-nil Liverpool lead, and that is the half-time score.
[3066.64 - 3072.64] P:1723.57 E:0.111095 |  So the early goal, with a very early penalty after 23 seconds for Sissoko's handball,
[3072.64 - 3076.64] P:1726.28 E:0.093855 |  it struck him high on the right arm, the arm was outstretched.
[3076.64 - 3080.64] P:1496.42 E:0.106392 |  Referee Scamina had no hesitation in pointing for the spot.
[3080.64 - 3086.64] P:1574.13 E:0.097525 |  It was whipped away, buried by Mo Salah to give Liverpool the lead in the second minute.
[3086.64 - 3091.64] P:1634.65 E:0.071227 |  We've seen lots of unforced errors from Tottenham.
[3091.64 - 3095.64] P:1759.78 E:0.093554 |  We've seen very little of Harry Kane, who was chosen to start this final,
[3095.64 - 3100.64] P:1572.62 E:0.075223 |  and at half-time Liverpool lead by one goal to nil,
[3100.64 - 3105.64] P:1627.11 E:0.092041 |  as the players troop down the tunnel and towards the dressing rooms here at the Metropolitano.
[3105.64 - 3109.64] P:1718.53 E:0.093329 |  So the half-time score, Tottenham hot-spurn nil, Liverpool one.
[3109.64 - 3114.64] P:1756.09 E:0.095916 |  I don't think they'll say the words unforced error as much on the first-air Wimbledon-shawn,
[3114.64 - 3116.64] P:1778.50 E:0.096611 |  as we have in the first half here.
[3116.64 - 3121.64] P:1698.02 E:0.095920 |  That was the weirdest 45 minutes, and I will just lay out the door.
[3121.64 - 3124.64] P:1717.31 E:0.086261 |  I think what we talked about beforehand, rust.
[3124.64 - 3127.64] P:1646.37 E:0.097553 |  Two and a half weeks of not playing, there was rust.
[3127.64 - 3131.64] P:1523.22 E:0.101481 |  Misplace passes, momentum loss, fluency loss, rhythm loss from both sides.
[3131.64 - 3133.64] P:1552.01 E:0.100183 |  Yeah, I think there's a bit of that.
[3133.64 - 3138.64] P:1578.32 E:0.091949 |  I think, you know, what we have mentioned in the build-up, this is a massive occasion.
[3138.64 - 3142.64] P:1692.95 E:0.093934 |  Even some of these players who have played in big occasions, you know, this is still a mess.
[3142.64 - 3144.64] P:1680.88 E:0.100941 |  So there'll be a nervousness.
[3144.64 - 3147.64] P:1647.88 E:0.088031 |  Usually that goes early in the game, but it doesn't seem to have seemed to linger.
[3147.64 - 3151.64] P:1606.78 E:0.092699 |  You know, both are even Liverpool, you know, they've found moments for sure,
[3151.64 - 3153.64] P:1624.12 E:0.087786 |  but nothing really fluid yet, you know.
[3153.64 - 3156.64] P:1695.30 E:0.107972 |  Tottenham the last little bit, Ericsson gets a shot off after a good bit of clever play,
[3156.64 - 3159.64] P:1544.89 E:0.080919 |  more like the Tottenham that we know, but that's been one pocket.
[3159.64 - 3163.64] P:1727.13 E:0.089176 |  They've equally been working on not so much a counter in a sense of how you imagine it
[3163.64 - 3167.64] P:1567.21 E:0.097669 |  quick passing through the thirds, but more direct going in behind Trippier for Mane,
[3167.64 - 3169.64] P:1742.41 E:0.087633 |  trying to release Son on the opposite side.
[3169.64 - 3173.64] P:1573.56 E:0.092515 |  Neither team actually will be overwhelmed with their performance,
[3173.64 - 3176.64] P:1625.85 E:0.088027 |  although Liverpool have looked nice and solid, they haven't really looked in trouble,
[3176.64 - 3178.64] P:1658.21 E:0.087761 |  particularly after taking out the early lead.
[3178.64 - 3181.64] P:1696.12 E:0.078607 |  Certainly a lot more to come from both, I would say.
[3181.64 - 3186.64] P:1573.06 E:0.090920 |  And looking at Liverpool there, Chris, it was almost like they were quite happy to,
[3186.64 - 3189.64] P:1734.54 E:0.093550 |  obviously, to allow Tottenham on to them to try and spring them on the break,
[3189.64 - 3194.64] P:1556.84 E:0.094110 |  but I was surprised at one up there, they didn't try to be a bit more proactive of themselves, Liverpool.
[3194.64 - 3196.64] P:1545.62 E:0.088301 |  Yeah, and I'd agree with that.
[3196.64 - 3203.64] P:1729.87 E:0.085172 |  I think that, you know, both sides have really lacked a rhythm with their passing,
[3203.64 - 3205.64] P:1769.38 E:0.067272 |  but this sort of suits Liverpool, doesn't it?
[3205.64 - 3208.64] P:1828.31 E:0.100518 |  It suits the way they play, they sit in, they keep their shape,
[3208.64 - 3210.64] P:1740.09 E:0.090323 |  they're like a coiled spring, aren't they?
[3210.64 - 3215.64] P:1673.61 E:0.088751 |  They recover the ball, and then they have that pace and that power up top,
[3215.64 - 3220.64] P:1805.84 E:0.083869 |  and that's going to be Tottenham's dilemma, but they will have to take a chance at some stage.
[3220.64 - 3222.64] P:1698.27 E:0.088695 |  What's been disappointing from Tottenham?
[3222.64 - 3226.64] P:1768.57 E:0.092189 |  You know, they've got a lot of attacking players, flair players on show,
[3226.64 - 3229.64] P:1672.41 E:0.083384 |  they haven't worked Allyson once in that first half,
[3229.64 - 3234.64] P:1728.28 E:0.092626 |  and that would be something that Poggitino will, I'm sure, be addressing at halftime.
[3234.64 - 3236.64] P:1740.87 E:0.087396 |  They need to offer more of a threat.
[3236.64 - 3237.64] P:1705.94 E:0.079668 |  How did they do that?
[3237.64 - 3239.64] P:1720.65 E:0.090060 |  Sean, how did Tottenham offer more of a threat?
[3239.64 - 3244.64] P:1489.56 E:0.086492 |  Well, I think they've got to speed up their play from when playing out from the back third,
[3244.64 - 3247.64] P:1593.08 E:0.099000 |  if you like, if they're playing out through a Larissa, they've got to speed that up,
[3247.64 - 3249.64] P:1571.32 E:0.091993 |  they've got to get turned into the pocket.
[3249.64 - 3251.64] P:1738.34 E:0.099966 |  You can play, you can lend it, you can bounce it back,
[3251.64 - 3254.64] P:1566.89 E:0.097108 |  but at some point you've got to get turned in their pockets to drive forward
[3254.64 - 3256.64] P:1444.04 E:0.091447 |  and open up the thought of playing forwards.
[3256.64 - 3259.64] P:1612.38 E:0.096569 |  I think they've got to mix it slightly more, I think,
[3259.64 - 3261.64] P:1643.26 E:0.093539 |  even from Larissa now and again, change the field,
[3261.64 - 3264.64] P:1656.22 E:0.092075 |  change the tempo, the field, kicking longer,
[3264.64 - 3267.64] P:1798.06 E:0.083344 |  just to ask a question and to stretch the game out.
[3267.64 - 3270.64] P:1582.94 E:0.100476 |  That all sounds obviously very easy, not so easy when you forget that Liverpool,
[3270.64 - 3273.64] P:1578.71 E:0.084809 |  they're such a fine side, they've got pace at the bat with Van Dijk,
[3273.64 - 3277.64] P:1531.94 E:0.089095 |  and he's a monster player, they've contained it well at the moment.
[3277.64 - 3279.64] P:1602.73 E:0.100070 |  I must say that Tile has worked at Henderson,
[3279.64 - 3282.64] P:1447.32 E:0.093330 |  things that fans don't always notice, but the detail behind that,
[3282.64 - 3284.64] P:1514.94 E:0.096862 |  filling in for Sallow,
[3284.64 - 3287.64] P:1562.65 E:0.091384 |  it's not natural for him to be working back all the time,
[3287.64 - 3289.64] P:1489.87 E:0.096970 |  you often see Henderson driving out there,
[3289.64 - 3291.64] P:1611.28 E:0.083028 |  for Beanie O getting across there,
[3291.64 - 3293.64] P:1454.90 E:0.112324 |  so they're doing the ugly things of the game very, very well,
[3293.64 - 3295.64] P:1477.55 E:0.099900 |  Liverpool at the minute, and of course we all know,
[3295.64 - 3299.64] P:1634.59 E:0.084429 |  within that they can equally hurt you at any given moment on the counter,
[3299.64 - 3302.64] P:1724.28 E:0.090066 |  so it's more in Liverpool's normal way of playing at the moment.
[3302.64 - 3305.64] P:1520.19 E:0.082938 |  Tottenham have got to go and ask more questions, I think they will,
[3305.64 - 3308.64] P:1515.26 E:0.080061 |  by the way, I think they will ask more questions second round.
[3308.64 - 3310.64] P:1733.62 E:0.106983 |  Now, VAR decided it was not a clear and obvious error,
[3310.64 - 3314.64] P:1678.09 E:0.096756 |  but looking at the pictures again, it seems as if he hit him under the armpit, Chris.
[3314.64 - 3317.64] P:1757.74 E:0.094501 |  And I guarantee that next season, I guarantee next season,
[3317.64 - 3320.64] P:1712.43 E:0.097578 |  Sean will say in some interview,
[3320.64 - 3323.64] P:1892.41 E:0.105662 |  I cannot believe that VAR has given a penalty against us for that,
[3323.64 - 3325.64] P:1702.62 E:0.092141 |  but it did seem, Chris, let me start with you,
[3325.64 - 3327.64] P:1453.79 E:0.095289 |  it seemed to hit him under the armpit, didn't it?
[3327.64 - 3331.64] P:1544.28 E:0.082986 |  Well, you know, we've seen Sean complain at various times this season,
[3331.64 - 3334.64] P:1770.77 E:0.088294 |  so nothing's going to change next season, I'm absolutely sure of that.
[3334.64 - 3337.64] P:1741.82 E:0.106558 |  What do you mean, only two penalties in 92 Premier League games?
[3337.64 - 3339.64] P:1529.69 E:0.086805 |  I'd have a complaint about that.
[3339.64 - 3343.64] P:1695.39 E:0.099985 |  There we go. Look, we're back to the old adage,
[3343.64 - 3347.64] P:1759.80 E:0.081052 |  you know, was it harsh? Absolutely was it harsh,
[3347.64 - 3351.64] P:1683.11 E:0.079288 |  but, you know, myself and John went to the VAR thing in London
[3351.64 - 3355.64] P:1654.45 E:0.100825 |  and referees are told to give penalties when the arm is in an unnatural position.
[3355.64 - 3359.64] P:1745.40 E:0.090182 |  I think it hits him on the chest first and then his arm, that is why...
[3359.64 - 3362.64] P:1967.48 E:0.092663 |  I thought it hit him on the chest and then the arm first, sure.
[3362.64 - 3366.64] P:1771.63 E:0.094923 |  That's why you don't tend to get penalties given for deflections,
[3366.64 - 3368.64] P:1687.48 E:0.094918 |  referees don't give a deflection penalty.
[3368.64 - 3372.64] P:1744.56 E:0.094553 |  No, I think he's given it for the unnatural position as much as anything,
[3372.64 - 3376.64] P:1579.42 E:0.089841 |  but the point is, even if your arm is in the unnatural position,
[3376.64 - 3378.64] P:1700.56 E:0.101534 |  so it's still going to hit it, you know, look to me,
[3378.64 - 3380.64] P:1544.26 E:0.091317 |  I haven't seen it back again on the replays yet,
[3380.64 - 3383.64] P:1764.59 E:0.086881 |  but it looked to me like it's him on the top side of his chest first,
[3383.64 - 3387.64] P:1783.99 E:0.083993 |  tough one to call, but it is likely to get given and it did get given.
[3387.64 - 3393.64] P:1724.88 E:0.082867 |  The thing is nowadays, if you're a player, you know in that situation
[3393.64 - 3397.64] P:1737.16 E:0.086148 |  you have your arms out or up that there's a chance of, you know,
[3397.64 - 3400.64] P:1718.09 E:0.097433 |  the referee awarding a penalty, so really, you know,
[3400.64 - 3404.64] P:1740.96 E:0.081777 |  you have to question Cisoko and say, what were you thinking?
[3404.64 - 3407.64] P:1772.59 E:0.099565 |  You have to say that to your players at the start of pre-season.
[3407.64 - 3411.64] P:1826.68 E:0.098153 |  In all seriousness, don't you, Sean, you cannot bend me Tarkowski or the rest of you,
[3411.64 - 3413.64] P:1791.85 E:0.106836 |  you cannot put your arms out like that, they will be given.
[3413.64 - 3418.64] P:1581.36 E:0.091230 |  To be fair, we've been talking, you know, with them about that for a number of seasons now,
[3418.64 - 3421.64] P:1598.25 E:0.093415 |  you know, we are renowned as a blocking team and they know how to block,
[3421.64 - 3425.64] P:1614.86 E:0.094997 |  they know how to keep their body shape right, I hope so anyway, I think they do.
[3425.64 - 3430.64] P:1666.97 E:0.094053 |  You are asking for trouble if your arms are not somewhere close to your body,
[3430.64 - 3433.64] P:1591.27 E:0.092491 |  if they start wandering around, you are going to get yourself in trouble at some point.
[3433.64 - 3438.64] P:1715.10 E:0.085697 |  The second quickest goal in the final, the quickest was against Liverpool,
[3438.64 - 3446.64] P:1740.93 E:0.098909 |  Paolo Maldini scored the first, almost the first, in 50 seconds as they race into the 3-0 win in Istanbul in 2005.
[3446.64 - 3451.64] P:1744.81 E:0.091301 |  But most allowed penalty on a rather surreal odd night, it's got to be said in Madrid,
[3451.64 - 3455.64] P:1711.68 E:0.090331 |  so far where the game just hasn't got going, but listen, fingers crossed 45 minutes ago,
[3455.64 - 3459.64] P:1844.48 E:0.090858 |  Liverpool in front by a goal to an ill and Stuart Clarkson here with the news.

[3473.64 - 3477.64] P:1560.62 E:0.097865 |  The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid says he's receiving regular updates on the situation
[3477.64 - 3479.64] P:1761.37 E:0.075131 |  and says the number is deeply concerning.
[3479.64 - 3485.64] P:1598.71 E:0.094386 |  The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland has condemned an attempt to murder one of his officers in Belfast this afternoon.
[3485.64 - 3488.64] P:1479.02 E:0.085943 |  A bomb was found under the man's car at a golf club where he'd been playing.
[3488.64 - 3492.64] P:1791.01 E:0.091187 |  Tributes have been paid to the former Arsalan Spain winger Jose Antonio Reyes,
[3492.64 - 3494.64] P:1631.04 E:0.093569 |  who's died in a car crash.
[3494.64 - 3498.64] P:1634.34 E:0.090235 |  He was 35 and part of the 2004 Invincibles who won the Premier League without losing a game.
[3498.64 - 3501.64] P:1227.76 E:0.087795 |  Arsenal says the club's devastated by the shock news.
[3501.64 - 3506.64] P:1790.06 E:0.083337 |  His former teammate Thierry-Henry has called him a wonderful player and an exceptional human being.
[3506.64 - 3512.64] P:1651.82 E:0.092384 |  And one bit of travel news tonight, the M6 is closed northbound between Stafford Services and Junction 15 at Stoke
[3512.64 - 3514.64] P:1651.53 E:0.089116 |  and overturned car in the road works.

[3533.64 - 3536.64] P:1347.10 E:0.135959 |  Madison Square Garden, the mecca of boxing.
[3536.64 - 3540.64] P:1017.61 E:0.140697 |  Against Ruiz you want to see a demonstrated knockout, too much strength, too much power.
[3540.64 - 3544.64] P:1815.67 E:0.143483 |  That is the greatest round of boxing we have had on the 5 Live.
[3544.64 - 3547.64] P:1124.32 E:0.143216 |  Joshua, the Ruiz Jr. tomorrow morning at 4.
[3547.64 - 3550.64] P:1605.23 E:0.137493 |  Who will land first? Who will land harder?

[3562.64 - 3565.64] P:1904.30 E:0.103499 |  Anthony Joshua against Andy Ruiz Jr. in the early hours of tomorrow morning.
[3565.64 - 3567.64] P:1958.79 E:0.104152 |  You heard Steve Bunce on the trail there.
[3567.64 - 3571.64] P:1789.31 E:0.074004 |  Buncey, whereabouts are you in the Big Apple exactly?
[3571.64 - 3575.64] P:1432.71 E:0.046280 |  MUSIC
[3578.64 - 3582.64] P:1798.69 E:0.103424 |  Thank you. Oh, Steve Bunce, can you hear us? Buncey, where are you?
[3586.64 - 3589.64] P:1782.38 E:0.118952 |  I think we are struggling. I've got you.
[3589.64 - 3593.64] P:1584.07 E:0.093859 |  Just off of 7. I'm here, I'm here, Pougers, don't worry.
[3593.64 - 3595.64] P:1416.92 E:0.089845 |  There's me and a thousand Liverpool fans.
[3595.64 - 3598.64] P:1511.10 E:0.090382 |  An ankle deep and in booze on the floor.
[3598.64 - 3604.64] P:1594.97 E:0.093462 |  On the floor, I should add. If I stay here much longer, it will be up my shins.
[3604.64 - 3607.64] P:1425.47 E:0.088227 |  It will probably reach my knees by the final whistle.
[3607.64 - 3609.64] P:1634.87 E:0.073106 |  OK, that's where you are.
[3609.64 - 3612.64] P:1778.09 E:0.096084 |  We've got a tight Champions League final here.
[3612.64 - 3616.64] P:1728.34 E:0.096939 |  Do you expect it to be a lot more one-sided for Anthony Joshua
[3616.64 - 3620.64] P:1839.07 E:0.094874 |  when you get going in the early hours of the morning hour time?
[3621.64 - 3624.64] P:1512.38 E:0.092689 |  It'll be a lot shorter than what I'm expecting here,
[3624.64 - 3626.64] P:1517.59 E:0.100587 |  or the match that you're watching,
[3626.64 - 3629.64] P:1499.57 E:0.085295 |  but it will be, I think, brutal for six or seven rounds,
[3629.64 - 3634.64] P:1386.68 E:0.096884 |  because Ruiz brings to the table everything that Joshua dislikes.
[3634.64 - 3637.64] P:1379.95 E:0.094339 |  He'll win, Josh, don't worry about that, Pougers,
[3637.64 - 3640.64] P:1506.45 E:0.089934 |  but it will be tough until it finishes in about round six.
[3640.64 - 3642.64] P:1637.15 E:0.094610 |  You've got three world title fights as well,
[3642.64 - 3646.64] P:1794.56 E:0.099051 |  so what else are you looking forward to before Anthony Joshua gets going?
[3646.64 - 3650.64] P:1263.93 E:0.093931 |  Well, whisper this, well, shout it, really, something this noisy barber.
[3650.64 - 3653.64] P:1395.91 E:0.102072 |  Katie Taylor is the real star, the Olympic champion,
[3653.64 - 3657.64] P:1301.78 E:0.095914 |  former amateur world champion, unbeaten as a professional.
[3657.64 - 3659.64] P:1363.81 E:0.099576 |  She's got three of the world title belts
[3659.64 - 3662.64] P:1343.69 E:0.093190 |  and she's fighting for the fourth one to become a unified champion,
[3662.64 - 3664.64] P:1372.66 E:0.104229 |  and they're rare these days.
[3664.64 - 3667.64] P:1331.53 E:0.090327 |  She's against a policewoman, a riot-controlled officer
[3667.64 - 3669.64] P:1367.08 E:0.087529 |  called Delphine Pursuit,
[3669.64 - 3671.64] P:1306.09 E:0.092281 |  and then the other world title fight
[3671.64 - 3674.64] P:1223.73 E:0.089353 |  is a man called Caleb Smith from Liverpool, a Liverpool fan,
[3674.64 - 3678.64] P:1234.12 E:0.094166 |  and as I'm talking to you, I'm looking at his father, known as the arm,
[3678.64 - 3682.64] P:1353.90 E:0.098070 |  his brother, known as Smigga, and his other brother, known as Liam.
[3682.64 - 3686.64] P:1367.76 E:0.099044 |  Now in this bar, three world title fights, one Irish woman and two Brits.
[3686.64 - 3689.64] P:1313.72 E:0.104062 |  It ain't a bad night or early morning.
[3689.64 - 3692.64] P:1475.58 E:0.088774 |  Steve, it's a great line-up. Looking forward to coverage from around.
[3692.64 - 3694.64] P:1634.95 E:0.099370 |  A half-poss one in the morning.
[3694.64 - 3698.64] P:1820.41 E:0.089682 |  Mike Costello, ringside David Hay and Carl Frampton with him.
[3698.64 - 3702.64] P:1951.13 E:0.088896 |  Of course, three world title fights, Joshua, about half-three in the morning.
[3702.64 - 3704.64] P:1839.50 E:0.096423 |  Tottenham and Liverpool's subs out there warming up.
[3704.64 - 3707.64] P:1928.57 E:0.080840 |  Tottenham's subs in particular may be needed soon.
[3707.64 - 3710.64] P:1706.00 E:0.095145 |  Emma Saunders is out in town with the Tottenham fans.
[3710.64 - 3714.64] P:1603.88 E:0.086915 |  Well, the Tottenham fans severely outnumbered here in the Irish Robe Bar,
[3714.64 - 3717.64] P:1396.74 E:0.083221 |  a stone throw from the Burnabout stadium,
[3717.64 - 3721.64] P:1425.33 E:0.089534 |  but Spurs not outplayed according to their supporters here.
[3721.64 - 3723.64] P:1564.12 E:0.097420 |  Luke, you've travelled from North London.
[3723.64 - 3725.64] P:1364.36 E:0.080280 |  What do you make of that first 45?
[3725.64 - 3727.64] P:1626.34 E:0.092326 |  We've absolutely dominated the game there.
[3727.64 - 3730.64] P:1599.03 E:0.100348 |  It's so frustrating that we've gone behind in the first minute.
[3730.64 - 3732.64] P:1387.22 E:0.100686 |  But, you know, we're banging the game.
[3732.64 - 3734.64] P:1598.52 E:0.095714 |  The boys look bang up for it today.
[3734.64 - 3738.64] P:1242.31 E:0.093105 |  We're creating chances, so hopefully we can get ourselves back into it.
[3738.64 - 3741.64] P:1314.92 E:0.099743 |  Well, you know the narrative of this first side in the Champions League.
[3741.64 - 3744.64] P:1514.68 E:0.092876 |  So far, this campaign, they've left it late.
[3744.64 - 3747.64] P:1493.38 E:0.080447 |  It's all to play for in the next 45.
[3747.64 - 3749.64] P:1975.75 E:0.076522 |  Emma, thank you very much indeed.
[3749.64 - 3751.64] P:1995.81 E:0.094680 |  Let me just bring you the other sports news today.
[3751.64 - 3755.64] P:1732.97 E:0.092398 |  Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka both knocked out of the French Open.
[3755.64 - 3759.64] P:1860.48 E:0.085968 |  Williams knocked out by another American, Sofia Kenin, 6-2-7-5,
[3759.64 - 3763.64] P:1752.27 E:0.090093 |  an Osaka, the world number one, beaten by the unceded Czech,
[3763.64 - 3767.64] P:1677.64 E:0.085529 |  Katharina Sinyakova, European champion Sarah Sunovertönder,
[3767.64 - 3772.64] P:1779.06 E:0.087295 |  11-point deficit to beat Exeter in a premiership final thriller at Twickenham.
[3772.64 - 3775.64] P:1680.00 E:0.088434 |  Sarah is winning 37-34 in the end.
[3775.64 - 3779.64] P:1694.55 E:0.088022 |  Trainer Aidan O'Bran won the Epsom Derby for a record-equalling seventh time
[3779.64 - 3782.64] P:1761.89 E:0.081254 |  with the 13-2 shot Anthony Van Dyke,
[3782.64 - 3784.64] P:2049.05 E:0.095209 |  ridden by the jockey, Shami Heffen.
[3784.64 - 3787.64] P:1656.92 E:0.088265 |  England's women's football has lost their final World Cup warm-up game,
[3787.64 - 3789.64] P:1910.32 E:0.086188 |  1-0 to New Zealand in Brighton.
[3789.64 - 3791.64] P:1575.78 E:0.082600 |  A couple of very one-sided games.
[3791.64 - 3793.64] P:1894.00 E:0.090673 |  That's a shame. That makes three in a row, doesn't it?
[3793.64 - 3797.64] P:1770.65 E:0.087853 |  In the cricket world, Carp Australia beat Afghanistan by seven wickets
[3797.64 - 3800.64] P:1746.86 E:0.088263 |  and New Zealand obliterated Sri Lanka by ten wickets.
[3800.64 - 3802.64] P:1907.33 E:0.071774 |  And in the Super League...
[3802.64 - 3807.64] P:1843.95 E:0.092435 |  In the Challenge Cup, the Super League leaders St Helens hammered Wakefield Trinity 48-10
[3807.64 - 3809.64] P:1741.09 E:0.089785 |  to reach the semifinals.
[3809.64 - 3812.64] P:1875.71 E:0.082062 |  The boxing then, Katie Taylor from 1-30 onwards,
[3812.64 - 3815.64] P:1851.08 E:0.080154 |  and then Mike Costello, David Hay and Carl Frampton with all the build-up,
[3815.64 - 3820.64] P:1705.82 E:0.089130 |  around about 3-30, Anthony Joshua with the Ring Walk.
[3820.64 - 3823.64] P:1982.54 E:0.078949 |  So, Sean Dice, Mauricio Pochettino,
[3823.64 - 3825.64] P:1685.16 E:0.092749 |  tell us what have you been saying to your players
[3825.64 - 3830.64] P:1724.79 E:0.083924 |  and what are you thinking about and when in terms of any potential changes?
[3830.64 - 3832.64] P:1699.73 E:0.082511 |  I think, first of all,
[3833.64 - 3835.64] P:1610.46 E:0.095756 |  God has sought out dealing with the ball better.
[3835.64 - 3838.64] P:1560.63 E:0.078770 |  You know, if you're going to play from the back as they want to,
[3838.64 - 3840.64] P:1401.89 E:0.095250 |  you know that Liverpool are going to oppress you,
[3840.64 - 3842.64] P:1520.34 E:0.096601 |  you've got to play quicker, you've got to play faster,
[3842.64 - 3844.64] P:1709.97 E:0.094223 |  you've got to be more effective with your passing,
[3844.64 - 3847.64] P:1639.36 E:0.088138 |  and if you're playing through the third, you've got to get turned.
[3847.64 - 3849.64] P:1748.27 E:0.087371 |  You know, players have got to get turned and then the runners off that,
[3849.64 - 3852.64] P:1591.89 E:0.097591 |  which Tottenham do really, really well, usually, by the way.
[3852.64 - 3855.64] P:1533.47 E:0.088409 |  Against that, if Liverpool come on a high line, you've got to ask questions.
[3855.64 - 3859.64] P:1632.38 E:0.088295 |  They've attempted to a couple of times, not really landed it with any quality.
[3859.64 - 3861.64] P:1610.12 E:0.089564 |  Trippier's got in behind a couple of times, not quite landed it.
[3861.64 - 3864.64] P:1690.48 E:0.096824 |  Once they've landed it, the other side rose now and again.
[3864.64 - 3867.64] P:1744.12 E:0.073412 |  Sean trying to stretch the pitch,
[3867.64 - 3869.64] P:1628.38 E:0.082193 |  really changed the feel of the game.
[3869.64 - 3872.64] P:1575.55 E:0.091853 |  If they keep playing like this, in front of Liverpool,
[3872.64 - 3876.64] P:1759.97 E:0.077598 |  you know, not with that true sort of zip that we know Tottenham can play with,
[3876.64 - 3878.64] P:1559.99 E:0.089512 |  then I think Liverpool are contained in well.
[3878.64 - 3883.64] P:1718.92 E:0.082829 |  Does he have a dilemma, Mariccio Pochettino, in Lucas Mora?
[3883.64 - 3885.64] P:1693.24 E:0.066275 |  When? When is he coming off?
[3885.64 - 3887.64] P:1898.37 E:0.108734 |  Yeah, I think he does. I think you're right.
[3887.64 - 3889.64] P:1730.52 E:0.072639 |  I think, you know, you're alluding to the right things.
[3889.64 - 3891.64] P:1862.39 E:0.089032 |  Kane has another service though, you mentioned that.
[3891.64 - 3896.64] P:1749.06 E:0.095705 |  You're a striker and you know that, he has no good service or that much service in general.
[3896.64 - 3900.64] P:1760.26 E:0.082615 |  But he does have that way of staying focused, OK, and he stays focused, he finds a chance.
[3900.64 - 3903.64] P:1836.73 E:0.088946 |  How long do you believe that he's going to find a chance?
[3904.64 - 3907.64] P:1712.35 E:0.091460 |  Not just him, by the way, but him being the main kingpin, you know,
[3907.64 - 3910.64] P:1647.89 E:0.092992 |  does Mora come on a bit more slippery, a bit more eel-like,
[3910.64 - 3912.64] P:1796.77 E:0.095230 |  he can get into them slots, he can ask questions in mind.
[3912.64 - 3915.64] P:1538.01 E:0.073029 |  Yeah, when Liverpool come high, it will happen.
[3915.64 - 3918.64] P:1542.27 E:0.089005 |  This is the big call of a manager. When do you make that decision?
[3918.64 - 3921.64] P:1617.04 E:0.092466 |  You know, that's got Pots, you know, and his staff have got a process now.
[3921.64 - 3923.64] P:1799.61 E:0.101181 |  But you only got 15 minutes to do it.
[3923.64 - 3925.64] P:1678.33 E:0.089882 |  But you know, Klopp will be rather frustrated as well, won't he Sean?
[3925.64 - 3927.64] P:1707.44 E:0.100269 |  Because they didn't play particularly, they contain comfortably.
[3927.64 - 3929.64] P:1798.27 E:0.096130 |  Well, yeah, again, not by their standards.
[3929.64 - 3932.64] P:1693.64 E:0.097842 |  You know, not that they've worked very well, the pressing lines are good, the shape's good,
[3932.64 - 3936.64] P:1654.08 E:0.094835 |  you know, the willingness to win it back in midfield and go searching to win it back,
[3936.64 - 3938.64] P:1491.95 E:0.099575 |  anticipate the play defensively very good.
[3938.64 - 3941.64] P:1708.12 E:0.094496 |  But by their standards, too many, you know, cheap giveaways,
[3941.64 - 3945.64] P:1748.23 E:0.094713 |  too many moments when they've overhit, passes, they've been on transition, overhit it,
[3945.64 - 3948.64] P:1714.29 E:0.088994 |  which is, you know, one of their main things, they do it so well.
[3948.64 - 3950.64] P:1702.03 E:0.087159 |  Both manager in a different way will be frustrated,
[3950.64 - 3954.64] P:1680.90 E:0.085758 |  but obviously Klopp knows he's in the lead, you know, and can they,
[3954.64 - 3957.64] P:1633.74 E:0.087291 |  do they contain the game now, or do they get back on the front foot
[3957.64 - 3960.64] P:1709.21 E:0.078071 |  and get a bit more Liverpool-like, if you like?
[3960.64 - 3963.64] P:1621.42 E:0.086583 |  Tottenham, they've got to open up the game, they've been attempting to,
[3963.64 - 3966.64] P:1595.24 E:0.094252 |  they just need to bring the quality that they've got to bring it to a forum,
[3966.64 - 3968.64] P:1784.98 E:0.075044 |  really ask questions to Liverpool.
[3968.64 - 3970.64] P:1846.87 E:0.084850 |  I'm not sure Klopp will be frustrated.
[3970.64 - 3972.64] P:1705.32 E:0.085093 |  Allyson has had nothing to do.
[3972.64 - 3977.64] P:1806.27 E:0.080684 |  This is the perfect position for Liverpool, you know, they want Spurs to come onto them,
[3977.64 - 3982.64] P:1606.67 E:0.083115 |  and then they have that zip and that pace and players who can hurt Spurs.
[3982.64 - 3985.64] P:1486.85 E:0.092575 |  I think you're right in that sense, but don't forget, on turnover,
[3985.64 - 3988.64] P:1499.07 E:0.101415 |  when they've turned the ball over, there's been so many of them, don't forget,
[3988.64 - 3990.64] P:1491.58 E:0.088448 |  they've got to get the first four stairs from Tottenham,
[3990.64 - 3992.64] P:1439.21 E:0.093747 |  playing into the hands of a team like Liverpool,
[3992.64 - 3995.64] P:1590.03 E:0.079170 |  because when they get their fourth stairs, particularly in the middle third,
[3995.64 - 3998.64] P:1674.54 E:0.081501 |  Liverpool are arguably them and Man City, particularly, you know,
[3998.64 - 4000.64] P:1658.92 E:0.091707 |  the best at turning their moments into chances.
[4000.64 - 4004.64] P:1666.67 E:0.090333 |  They react very, very quickly, stimulate themselves to go and drive forwards.
[4004.64 - 4007.64] P:1702.36 E:0.085666 |  I don't, that's the only criticism Liverpool's wanted here,
[4007.64 - 4012.64] P:1646.84 E:0.086291 |  and Klopp would be thinking that deep down, because he's searching for that big win.
[4012.64 - 4016.64] P:1640.28 E:0.083446 |  One-nil is not that easy to switch players, what he's hoping for.
[4016.64 - 4018.64] P:1596.49 E:0.109036 |  He certainly would get a very tense state like that.
[4018.64 - 4020.64] P:1674.58 E:0.094459 |  Tottenham have been out for about 90 seconds, I reckon.
[4020.64 - 4022.64] P:1704.40 E:0.100253 |  Liverpool are finally on their way.
[4022.64 - 4025.64] P:1718.35 E:0.089453 |  They're going to be playing towards where their fans are masked behind that goal.
[4025.64 - 4028.64] P:1676.83 E:0.101352 |  When we're done here, whether it's 90 minutes, 120 pens, whatever,
[4028.64 - 4030.64] P:1695.93 E:0.086875 |  Robbie Savages here and Steve Crossman with 6-0-6,
[4030.64 - 4034.64] P:1697.87 E:0.103294 |  so the lines will be open very, very soon for that to get your calls in,
[4034.64 - 4037.64] P:1759.39 E:0.112601 |  because the domestic season really will be over after this,
[4037.64 - 4039.64] P:1703.56 E:0.116737 |  and then we'll be in 2-0 to Nassau's.
[4039.64 - 4042.64] P:1759.42 E:0.099991 |  Sorry, I must say as well, I think you will see a reaction.
[4042.64 - 4044.64] P:1757.29 E:0.091274 |  Tottenham have done this before, you know, this season.
[4044.64 - 4045.64] P:1685.19 E:0.124065 |  Oh, I'm thinking that.
[4045.64 - 4048.64] P:1687.08 E:0.094494 |  They're quite a half, and then they come to life.
[4048.64 - 4052.64] P:1643.71 E:0.095239 |  Some teams need a half-time, it sounds crazy, but they need a half-time.
[4052.64 - 4053.64] P:1711.07 E:0.081561 |  It gives them a shake.
[4053.64 - 4055.64] P:1723.20 E:0.089178 |  The manager shakes and they shake each other.
[4055.64 - 4057.64] P:1409.82 E:0.098530 |  I'll be very surprised if they don't come out cleaner
[4057.64 - 4059.64] P:1641.84 E:0.082183 |  with a bit more zip in their play,
[4059.64 - 4061.64] P:1598.49 E:0.099991 |  and a bit more forcefulness in their body language
[4061.64 - 4063.64] P:1684.30 E:0.079865 |  to go forward and attack the opposition.
[4063.64 - 4065.64] P:1733.57 E:0.105243 |  I would imagine, John, that Jürgen Klopp has said that to Liverpool,
[4065.64 - 4068.64] P:1730.88 E:0.100086 |  that he would anticipate as Sean says that Tottenham will come out
[4068.64 - 4071.64] P:1793.37 E:0.085951 |  with a little bit of oomph in this second half.
[4071.64 - 4073.64] P:1602.90 E:0.087892 |  The whole game needs some oomph, John.
[4073.64 - 4077.64] P:1734.72 E:0.085314 |  It does, yes, it's been rather disappointing, disjointed so far,
[4077.64 - 4080.64] P:1747.67 E:0.096050 |  but Liverpool happy enough with the 1-0 lead
[4080.64 - 4085.64] P:1579.58 E:0.089567 |  that they hold from Mohsala's penalty in the second minute.
[4085.64 - 4089.64] P:1642.94 E:0.091834 |  So Tottenham will get the second half underway,
[4089.64 - 4091.64] P:1857.23 E:0.097148 |  no substitutions, no changes.
[4091.64 - 4094.64] P:1758.71 E:0.092301 |  So Tottenham, as they were with Laurie Sengal,
[4094.64 - 4096.64] P:1688.30 E:0.096401 |  Trippia Aldervireld for Tongan and Rose,
[4096.64 - 4099.64] P:1618.51 E:0.082152 |  Cisoco in winks, Ericsson, Alley, Son and Kane,
[4099.64 - 4101.64] P:1484.57 E:0.097125 |  Lucas Murow is watching him warm up
[4101.64 - 4104.64] P:1472.24 E:0.083698 |  during the half-time break in his green bib,
[4104.64 - 4107.64] P:1290.00 E:0.098033 |  and Liverpool with Allyson, Alexander-Arnold,
[4107.64 - 4110.64] P:1436.00 E:0.090153 |  Matip van Dijk and Robertson, Henderson Fabinho,
[4110.64 - 4113.64] P:1395.44 E:0.084624 |  Vain Alden, Salah Fimino and Mane.
[4113.64 - 4115.64] P:1481.69 E:0.096923 |  If I could just pull me out of the sand, you know, for one minute,
[4115.64 - 4117.64] P:1386.99 E:0.071099 |  look at that scene though.
[4117.64 - 4119.64] P:1646.93 E:0.096533 |  Look now the lights on, look at the darkness in the sky,
[4119.64 - 4121.64] P:1525.53 E:0.091425 |  the lights ringing round the stadium,
[4121.64 - 4124.64] P:1625.70 E:0.084784 |  look at the sea of the shirt, fantastic scene, I must say.
[4124.64 - 4129.64] P:1544.16 E:0.089350 |  It is really quite special on this warm, warm night here in Madrid
[4129.64 - 4134.64] P:1457.52 E:0.100605 |  in the metropolitan, all red to our right, all white to our left,
[4134.64 - 4138.64] P:1472.41 E:0.097250 |  and red currently in the ascendancy because of that Salah penalty.
[4138.64 - 4141.64] P:1433.09 E:0.102388 |  Ball out of play for Throne to Tottenham, over on the far side,
[4141.64 - 4143.64] P:1326.84 E:0.094984 |  which is taken back to winks.
[4143.64 - 4146.64] P:1343.57 E:0.105211 |  If Lucas Murow does come on, who does make way, Chris Sutton?
[4146.64 - 4149.64] P:1617.01 E:0.109483 |  Well, you would think Harry Kane, you know,
[4149.64 - 4153.64] P:1519.38 E:0.110774 |  and this is, we'll find out soon what we, how fit is Harry Kane.
[4153.64 - 4156.64] P:1456.47 E:0.095117 |  You have to say he didn't get the service in the first half,
[4156.64 - 4160.64] P:1538.66 E:0.095373 |  but are they missing that Mora Zip Spurs?
[4160.64 - 4166.64] P:1571.29 E:0.092835 |  Haven't created anything, and we know his dynamism can cause Liverpool problems.
[4166.64 - 4169.64] P:1708.50 E:0.099934 |  Chris Sutton with this, Sean Deitch with this, Robbie Savage as well.
[4169.64 - 4172.64] P:1607.43 E:0.100663 |  Here, come Tottenham with the ball on the right-hand side,
[4172.64 - 4175.64] P:1474.70 E:0.083864 |  Sone up against Robertson, onto his left foot,
[4175.64 - 4177.64] P:1770.18 E:0.097053 |  uses his right, gives it back to Trippier,
[4177.64 - 4179.64] P:1581.35 E:0.110285 |  who's crossed his deep to the back post, Deli Alley,
[4179.64 - 4182.64] P:1627.81 E:0.101010 |  off-balance tried to hit it back across the area,
[4182.64 - 4184.64] P:1550.87 E:0.114415 |  got it all wrong in Liverpool, Cleared.
[4184.64 - 4186.64] P:1626.78 E:0.115565 |  There you go, like I said, changing the feel,
[4186.64 - 4188.64] P:1421.13 E:0.095199 |  sliding it in behind the back for Liverpool,
[4188.64 - 4192.64] P:1429.86 E:0.098814 |  getting a good delivery in, and just asking the question really early in the second half.
[4192.64 - 4193.64] P:1448.44 E:0.116074 |  With Sone suddenly on the right.
[4193.64 - 4197.64] P:1462.24 E:0.089846 |  Yeah, he started on the right this half, tactical tweak, maybe.
[4197.64 - 4201.64] P:1505.67 E:0.110437 |  It was a poor header from Alley, good ball, deep ball.
[4202.64 - 4206.64] P:1273.90 E:0.110642 |  Alley had the touchline, got it all wrong the header, and it was cleared.
[4206.64 - 4209.64] P:1512.94 E:0.101739 |  There you go, yeah, again, Maurice kicking it, changing the feel.
[4209.64 - 4211.64] P:1676.22 E:0.100258 |  Loris up to Kane, Kane takes it down,
[4211.64 - 4214.64] P:1655.92 E:0.105164 |  drifts out to the left-hand side into the box, pulls it across,
[4214.64 - 4218.64] P:1643.59 E:0.105986 |  but in behind Deli Alley, and too far ahead of Sone,
[4218.64 - 4221.64] P:1620.08 E:0.110496 |  he actually split the two of them, and the ball's out for a throw on the far side.
[4221.64 - 4225.64] P:1686.36 E:0.104848 |  Yeah, but we know from this European adventure for Tottenham,
[4225.64 - 4228.64] P:1612.89 E:0.089955 |  right them off, that's your peril.
[4228.64 - 4230.64] P:1597.10 E:0.080161 |  I was just going to say that to you.
[4230.64 - 4232.64] P:1337.24 E:0.086424 |  We're not righting them off yet, Chris.
[4232.64 - 4236.64] P:1428.48 E:0.094725 |  He nicks everything, I'll say he nicks everything apart from Robbie's gear.
[4236.64 - 4237.64] P:1561.41 E:0.099461 |  Ha-ha!
[4239.64 - 4241.64] P:1446.94 E:0.095513 |  1-0 Liverpool lead.
[4241.64 - 4247.64] P:1544.30 E:0.095460 |  And this is BBC Radio, live from Madrid, five live, the World Service,
[4247.64 - 4254.64] P:1538.42 E:0.088571 |  BBC London, and Radio Merseyside, all together for this Champions League final of 2019.
[4255.64 - 4258.64] P:1465.76 E:0.106445 |  Fabinho stabbing the ball over the halfway line on the far side,
[4258.64 - 4264.64] P:1600.89 E:0.087346 |  Trippier gets it down, but there, one of those mistakes, an unforced error.
[4264.64 - 4267.64] P:1577.90 E:0.075185 |  Trippier just stabs it out of play on the far side,
[4267.64 - 4270.64] P:1346.49 E:0.080491 |  and it's a throw into Liverpool inside their own half.
[4270.64 - 4275.64] P:1399.57 E:0.094428 |  I remember late 70s and early 80s, the European Cup final as it was then,
[4275.64 - 4278.64] P:1535.93 E:0.090664 |  was very often decided by just the one goal.
[4278.64 - 4283.64] P:1732.50 E:0.101565 |  In recent seasons, though, we've seen some really special matches, full of goals,
[4283.64 - 4289.64] P:1641.29 E:0.100524 |  just the one so far in this one, and it has been, for large parts, rather scrappy.
[4290.64 - 4295.64] P:1630.27 E:0.096787 |  Ball at the back with Fatongan, Salah was quickly onto it,
[4295.64 - 4299.64] P:1566.61 E:0.093238 |  back it went to Loris, who cleared to the halfway line, comes back to Fatongan,
[4299.64 - 4302.64] P:1619.92 E:0.093178 |  he chests it down, Fatongan volleys it, up towards the left-hand side,
[4302.64 - 4305.64] P:1597.20 E:0.097813 |  Deli Ali can't keep that in, it's a throw.
[4305.64 - 4307.64] P:1598.25 E:0.086163 |  It seemed to panic, Fatongan did.
[4307.64 - 4314.64] P:1600.30 E:0.086497 |  What I will say, John, I can't see this with the nature of Mariccio Pochettino.
[4314.64 - 4316.64] P:1605.82 E:0.093423 |  I can't see this ending 1-0, I really can't,
[4316.64 - 4319.64] P:1728.31 E:0.101941 |  because eventually he will just go all in.
[4319.64 - 4322.64] P:1405.41 E:0.088517 |  I agree, as he did, as he probably should.
[4322.64 - 4326.64] P:1615.78 E:0.091819 |  You know, he has to chase it, not yet, but there comes a time when he's got to chase it, I agree.
[4326.64 - 4330.64] P:1458.44 E:0.090329 |  Liverpool throw above Salah, so this time Alderv Irold comes across,
[4330.64 - 4334.64] P:1673.88 E:0.092372 |  and he just hooks it away out of play near the halfway line,
[4334.64 - 4338.64] P:1436.69 E:0.092953 |  where Robertson will take the throw, where Alexander-Arnold will take the throw,
[4338.64 - 4342.64] P:1474.22 E:0.104017 |  which he does, Firmino nods it back towards the halfway line, Alexander-Arnold can't keep this in.
[4342.64 - 4345.64] P:1421.33 E:0.103221 |  Now it's a Liverpool series of errors, Natottenham throw.
[4345.64 - 4349.64] P:1464.67 E:0.109788 |  Yeah, and he would be the one player, I think, Liverpool player, in the first half,
[4349.64 - 4355.64] P:1636.22 E:0.099688 |  he looked very leggy, Firmino did, and I wonder where the clock is thinking about the change.
[4355.64 - 4360.64] P:1608.31 E:0.109707 |  See, even little things like this for me, and I know, warm night, everything considered,
[4360.64 - 4363.64] P:1513.10 E:0.112258 |  but it's the Champions League, speed the throwings up, speed everything up,
[4363.64 - 4366.64] P:1481.98 E:0.108298 |  you know, if on top of the goal, speed the tempo of the game, get your team on the front foot,
[4366.64 - 4369.64] P:1288.36 E:0.109937 |  sometimes it's just by doing them little detail, doing them quicker.
[4369.64 - 4373.64] P:1491.55 E:0.117455 |  Keane gets to the ball first in centre field, and Vinaldo catches it, free kick.
[4373.64 - 4378.64] P:1548.24 E:0.109960 |  Sorry, hand on the play, hand on the play, should hand on the play, get, you know, build a tempo.
[4379.64 - 4384.64] P:1625.31 E:0.112299 |  Free kick, Fordham left of the centre circle, won by Keane, so Tottenham have this,
[4384.64 - 4389.64] P:1485.76 E:0.116587 |  Tottenham in the second half, right-wise Liverpool are attacking the ends where their own supporters are,
[4389.64 - 4394.64] P:1664.98 E:0.104267 |  so the Spurs fans are trying to suck this in, Trippier takes the free kick over the line,
[4394.64 - 4399.64] P:1690.91 E:0.104614 |  Son in the area, lays it back, shot from Fertonghen, was blocked by a Liverpool defender,
[4399.64 - 4405.64] P:1659.09 E:0.091939 |  and the flag is up on the far side, and it's a free kick to Liverpool, who lead by one goal to nil.
[4405.64 - 4410.64] P:1614.11 E:0.095824 |  One off the training ground, Son, I just wonder whether he went slightly early,
[4410.64 - 4416.64] P:1723.43 E:0.093463 |  they're in a central position, he does go early, really sloppy from Spurs,
[4416.64 - 4418.64] P:1675.58 E:0.119770 |  good line from Liverpool, high line.
[4419.64 - 4424.64] P:1441.73 E:0.098650 |  Liverpool take the free kick and work it towards the half-way line,
[4424.64 - 4431.64] P:1573.45 E:0.112980 |  pass from Firmino is over the head of Henderson, and I'm afraid the pattern of the first half has continued into the second,
[4431.64 - 4435.64] P:1520.23 E:0.102723 |  this time an error from Firmino just to lift it out of play on the half-way line,
[4435.64 - 4446.64] P:1469.07 E:0.093166 |  Rose will take the throw in for Tottenham, Sosoko comes short, it was Sosoko who conceded the penalty after just 23 seconds,
[4446.64 - 4449.64] P:1574.19 E:0.094400 |  which was eventually taken and scored by Salah,
[4449.64 - 4456.64] P:1490.10 E:0.089791 |  Loris now long to the half-way line, this one's won by the head of Firmino, now Alexander-Arnold,
[4456.64 - 4460.64] P:1544.74 E:0.099335 |  he hits a long one down the right-hand side, this is for Salah to chase,
[4460.64 - 4465.64] P:1652.72 E:0.096120 |  but Fertonghen was close to the Egyptian and was able to take the ball and play it away,
[4465.64 - 4471.64] P:1663.60 E:0.110308 |  Sosoko does well under pressure, Sosoko plays it to Ericsson, Ericsson now making good ground,
[4471.64 - 4475.64] P:1692.91 E:0.107943 |  pulls the ball across, square, winches in the edge of the penalty area,
[4475.64 - 4479.64] P:1601.70 E:0.101514 |  then an important interception, an important block really from Robertson,
[4479.64 - 4481.64] P:1750.85 E:0.099738 |  and Liverpool are able to snuff out the danger.
[4481.64 - 4487.64] P:1705.81 E:0.107940 |  We saw everything good about Sosoko there, power and pace down the left-hand side,
[4487.64 - 4490.64] P:1771.43 E:0.105761 |  and the ball eventually gets out to Winks right-hand side of the box,
[4490.64 - 4494.64] P:1631.97 E:0.097179 |  he tries to push it round Robertson who defended it very, very well.
[4494.64 - 4499.64] P:1513.75 E:0.099949 |  Trippie are there seeing the game, open up for the first time and he's driving into the box,
[4499.64 - 4503.64] P:1645.60 E:0.107056 |  you see that from him a lot when he's really on the side, as you said, Sosoko's power,
[4503.64 - 4505.64] P:1437.91 E:0.109063 |  the pace to break it open and Trippie are noticing that,
[4505.64 - 4510.64] P:1448.63 E:0.096573 |  drives down the right-hand side of the field and nearly gets himself into a really, really good goal-scoring position.
[4510.64 - 4516.64] P:1569.85 E:0.093327 |  Robertson playing the ball right across the field, over the half-way line,
[4516.64 - 4521.64] P:1568.23 E:0.103060 |  and Alexander-Arnold now swells the ball into the penalty area just beyond Salah,
[4521.64 - 4526.64] P:1629.93 E:0.099741 |  Firmino wasn't far away as well, it's Manet actually who reaches the ball and keeps it in on the far side,
[4526.64 - 4530.64] P:1562.30 E:0.091476 |  Manet stabs it into the box, Vainaldum now back to Firmino on the left-hand side,
[4530.64 - 4534.64] P:1594.86 E:0.091465 |  Tottenham are back in position now, a dangerous ball from the full-backs,
[4534.64 - 4539.64] P:1688.74 E:0.091767 |  one to the other, Firmino is going to shoot, it's deflected, Llorisak moves quickly to his left,
[4539.64 - 4543.64] P:1666.75 E:0.103531 |  and is able to pat it down and has it back in his gloves, one near Liverpool lead.
[4543.64 - 4548.64] P:1620.52 E:0.094253 |  On five-live, we will have a 6-0-6 following the Champions League final,
[4548.64 - 4555.64] P:1457.94 E:0.097977 |  which will be hosted by Steve Crossman and Robbie Savage, and the lines will probably be open.
[4556.64 - 4564.64] P:1421.31 E:0.104785 |  08, 08, 5, 9, 0, 9, 6, 9, 3, I'll let you know when they are, they must be open now, I would have thought.
[4564.64 - 4569.64] P:1537.57 E:0.105543 |  Anyway, I'll let you know, 8, 5, 0, 5, 8, you can text now or you can get in touch,
[4569.64 - 4575.64] P:1591.31 E:0.103482 |  social media, hashtag BBC 606, Vainaldum plays the ball over the top now to Salah, Salah in the area,
[4575.64 - 4579.64] P:1613.63 E:0.104419 |  Salah shoots into the chest of Firtongan and the ball bounces out of the penalty area,
[4579.64 - 4584.64] P:1667.35 E:0.105778 |  Salah still interested in this, Sasoko, Salah was able to touch it back towards Vainaldum,
[4584.64 - 4589.64] P:1629.94 E:0.105499 |  and then Henderson to Fabinho, Fabinho now to the left-hand side, Robertson has space here,
[4589.64 - 4594.64] P:1716.57 E:0.113457 |  takes it on, plays it in to the edge of the six-yard box, where Loris dives forward
[4594.64 - 4597.64] P:1754.04 E:0.106764 |  and makes an excellent catch at the feet of Manic.
[4597.64 - 4601.64] P:1633.55 E:0.108267 |  Oh, that's outstanding goalkeeping, it really is that ball from Robertson,
[4601.64 - 4607.64] P:1680.38 E:0.097792 |  whipped in across the six-yard line, Larisse anticipated and Claudit kept it away from Mane.
[4608.64 - 4612.64] P:1336.06 E:0.087595 |  Tottenham, with the ball on the halfway line,
[4612.64 - 4617.64] P:1492.58 E:0.092205 |  runners through the middle, Alley making a run and he's been found and chess it down,
[4617.64 - 4623.64] P:1619.52 E:0.102718 |  and Alley with a chance, it's blocked, bounces out, actually came off the head of Harry Kane,
[4623.64 - 4627.64] P:1666.05 E:0.097915 |  he was stretching for it, Henderson, Henderson's appealing for it,
[4627.64 - 4631.64] P:1694.77 E:0.093930 |  he thinks that Harry Kane has felled mad at him, who was very strong against Kane.
[4631.64 - 4634.64] P:1600.61 E:0.111185 |  Tottenham showing signs now, as we said, asking more questions, you know,
[4634.64 - 4639.64] P:1505.26 E:0.096818 |  no Liverpool, just got a great one, Tottenham now just working the back four all of a sudden with Liverpool.
[4640.64 - 4647.64] P:1305.80 E:0.110632 |  Tottenham with the ball inside their own heart, here's Ericsson, who plays it all the way back to Futonham,
[4647.64 - 4652.64] P:1393.96 E:0.112772 |  just having a little look here, where the Liverpool might be thinking about a change,
[4652.64 - 4659.64] P:1563.54 E:0.097455 |  we've got Oxlade, Chamberlain, and Ariegi, looks like Ariegi is going to be coming onto the field.
[4660.64 - 4664.64] P:1621.83 E:0.114975 |  Here's Rose on the left-hand side, Alexander-Arnold, that looked like a dive by Rose,
[4664.64 - 4669.64] P:1530.52 E:0.095423 |  I must say, comes back to Ericsson, ball into the penalty area, that's cleared by Mattip,
[4669.64 - 4678.64] P:1726.13 E:0.099006 |  and Danny Rose has stayed down after that challenge, he went down very theatrically.
[4678.64 - 4686.64] P:1719.28 E:0.094153 |  He did, I do think that there was contact, Rose shapes the whip the ball and left footed from the touch line,
[4686.64 - 4692.64] P:1598.28 E:0.096454 |  and his arm, his leg comes out, Alexander-Arnold, and he does go down and he stayed down.
[4692.64 - 4695.64] P:1241.09 E:0.096114 |  Got to be a foul, got to be a foul.
[4698.64 - 4703.64] P:1504.28 E:0.114204 |  Well he is still down on the pitch, Danny Rose, and is receiving treatment.
[4703.64 - 4710.64] P:1442.20 E:0.106025 |  So Tottenham nil, Liverpool won, are you seeing signs of improvement for Tottenham?
[4710.64 - 4715.64] P:1613.90 E:0.110048 |  Well they're pushing and they're probing, I mean, in an attacking sense, you know, they had to improve.
[4715.64 - 4720.64] P:1492.61 E:0.103854 |  But Pochettino is a gambler, you know, we know, we know with both managers,
[4720.64 - 4726.64] P:1646.54 E:0.111993 |  they brainwash their players into believing, we've seen it so many times this season,
[4726.64 - 4732.64] P:1554.52 E:0.111878 |  that's why you cannot rule this first team out, they have the talent, this season they've shown,
[4732.64 - 4735.64] P:1525.49 E:0.107359 |  they have their belief and belief in abundance.
[4736.64 - 4742.64] P:1445.33 E:0.117465 |  Danny Rose back on his feet, one of the five Englishmen in the Tottenham starting lineup today,
[4742.64 - 4749.64] P:1532.94 E:0.099984 |  in this final between the two English clubs, two Englishmen and a Scotsman in the Liverpool team.
[4749.64 - 4755.64] P:1604.69 E:0.093277 |  Tottenham, you know Chris, actually played in the first all English European final,
[4755.64 - 4761.64] P:1503.30 E:0.092852 |  back in 1972 against Wolves, and how many players do you think there were on the field at the start,
[4761.64 - 4767.64] P:1542.63 E:0.091093 |  who were from, let's say, Britain or Ireland? Here's Son, Son getting away from Fabinho.
[4767.64 - 4772.64] P:1709.97 E:0.100600 |  Son now takes it on towards the edge of the box, he's going wide, he's being forced wide by Robertson.
[4772.64 - 4776.64] P:1731.80 E:0.103322 |  Still Son turns and plays it into the shins of Robertson and wins a corner to Tottenham.
[4776.64 - 4778.64] P:1675.16 E:0.101638 |  It's a good drive.
[4778.64 - 4782.64] P:1551.73 E:0.095144 |  More dynamic, you know, the Tottenham body language, the feel of it, they're being more dynamic,
[4782.64 - 4786.64] P:1478.16 E:0.092837 |  more, let's say, wrist, but in a calculated way, you know, getting their key players, getting turned,
[4786.64 - 4793.64] P:1499.86 E:0.095118 |  running at people, getting better situations also, much more life in the Tottenham side at this moment.
[4793.64 - 4797.64] P:1321.51 E:0.098461 |  Corner from the right flank, Alderweirold near the penalty spot,
[4797.64 - 4801.64] P:1468.43 E:0.093702 |  Harry Kane just in front of him, Fertonghen behind Alderweirold,
[4801.64 - 4806.64] P:1691.44 E:0.092131 |  and here is the delivery now from the right, Alisson comes, gets a left hook to it,
[4806.64 - 4811.64] P:1725.35 E:0.101774 |  out of Rose who drives it in, comes off the legs of Salah and bounces away towards the corner flag
[4811.64 - 4813.64] P:1646.63 E:0.103367 |  and out for a corner for Spurs from the other side.
[4813.64 - 4819.64] P:1517.76 E:0.081344 |  I think it's the first thing Alisson has had to do with his hands, comes and punches,
[4819.64 - 4823.64] P:1511.04 E:0.093354 |  Spurs, just feel there's something in it for them now.
[4823.64 - 4828.64] P:1498.94 E:0.094993 |  Corner from the left this time, Rose to take this one, it's a deep one towards the back post
[4828.64 - 4832.64] P:1606.98 E:0.096670 |  and it's headed back across but comfortably over the top of the crossbar,
[4832.64 - 4836.64] P:1593.97 E:0.094137 |  Alisson was able to just watch it disappear over the top from Fertonghen's header
[4836.64 - 4838.64] P:1478.33 E:0.104167 |  and it's a goal kick to Liverpool who lead 1-0.
[4838.64 - 4845.64] P:1629.06 E:0.099247 |  There's an out-swinger for Fertonghen, beyond the far post, he should just try and help that across.
[4846.64 - 4850.64] P:1789.51 E:0.110173 |  He gets it wrong, goes over the bar but for me, no, coming off, he has looked leggy.
[4850.64 - 4854.64] P:1697.01 E:0.111494 |  Yeah, we wondered, didn't we? We wondered, you know, the same question Mark of Kane,
[4854.64 - 4858.64] P:1726.71 E:0.108270 |  you know, going into game mode, because you spoke about it yesterday, you spoke about it today,
[4858.64 - 4861.64] P:1742.79 E:0.114869 |  you know, centre-forward going into game mode, you're really on that sharp edge,
[4861.64 - 4866.64] P:1687.42 E:0.104008 |  you really got that inner fitness that it takes to perform anyway, but in particular, nights like this.
[4866.64 - 4872.64] P:1647.70 E:0.092615 |  But you've got the young man to come on who scored two of the goals against Barcelona,
[4872.64 - 4876.64] P:1612.51 E:0.089566 |  which were incidentally his first ever goals in the Champions League
[4876.64 - 4881.64] P:1601.73 E:0.101364 |  and also scored the winner at Newcastle at the latter end of the Premier League season,
[4881.64 - 4884.64] P:1482.53 E:0.075385 |  so Firmino is off and Origi is on.
[4884.64 - 4889.64] P:1638.86 E:0.091136 |  Yeah, just when we thought that Liverpool were really stretched, you know, the main man out,
[4889.64 - 4894.64] P:1658.65 E:0.081886 |  Salah missing, Origi stood up on the big occasion.
[4895.64 - 4900.64] P:1516.74 E:0.100415 |  1-0 Liverpool lead, BBC Radio 5 Live, got the boxing tonight as well,
[4900.64 - 4905.64] P:1629.97 E:0.095398 |  from New York during the course of the night, three world title fights, Anthony Joshua top of the bill.
[4905.64 - 4908.64] P:1595.47 E:0.099505 |  That'll be around about 3.30, I'm told.
[4908.64 - 4910.64] P:1624.43 E:0.117188 |  Henderson again there, you know, Henderson, the ball gets kicked out of the key,
[4910.64 - 4915.64] P:1630.70 E:0.102586 |  drives across to shut the play down very, very quickly, you know, things that us managers love,
[4915.64 - 4919.64] P:1474.83 E:0.093187 |  you know, I don't always notice that, things that us managers love, he anticipates,
[4919.64 - 4922.64] P:1531.24 E:0.086690 |  drives across, endless tireless work for them.
[4922.64 - 4927.64] P:1505.29 E:0.096709 |  It's an excellent finish to the season, Jordan Henderson, here's Alderweirold with the ball at the back,
[4927.64 - 4933.64] P:1509.83 E:0.089224 |  Alderweirold high and over the top, Van Dijk got up, got his head to it above the falling Harry Kane,
[4933.64 - 4938.64] P:1396.14 E:0.096754 |  and he's being able to direct it out to Robertson, but for once Robertson goes for a long pass downfield,
[4938.64 - 4944.64] P:1533.08 E:0.094482 |  which is way beyond Origi and through to Loris, we've got half an hour to go.
[4944.64 - 4952.64] P:1585.01 E:0.081427 |  And that dual so far, Van Dijk, Kane, Van Dijk, it's colossal, he's bullying him at present,
[4952.64 - 4956.64] P:1597.32 E:0.105827 |  he only needs one chance, one half chance, Harry Kane.
[4956.64 - 4961.64] P:1395.80 E:0.100795 |  Well it's already been a good day for Van Dijk, Anthony Van Dijk won the derby,
[4961.64 - 4968.64] P:1442.87 E:0.099869 |  Trippia plays it forward towards Son, but it's over his head and Van Dijk was able to clear it away,
[4968.64 - 4974.64] P:1550.54 E:0.095636 |  Winx in the centre circle, now Manet, for the crossfield volley headed forward by Henderson,
[4974.64 - 4980.64] P:1556.38 E:0.105723 |  Alderweirold headed it away, heavy touch from Vijn Alden and that means Tottenham are back in possession,
[4980.64 - 4985.64] P:1587.83 E:0.105273 |  urged on by there, I can see some of them in the stands actually standing and jumping up and down,
[4985.64 - 4992.64] P:1641.24 E:0.090670 |  urging Tottenham forward as we move towards the last half hour of this Champions League final, Winx.
[4992.64 - 5000.64] P:1731.48 E:0.090755 |  Ericsson back to Harry Winx, still no immediate sign of the arrival of Lucas Moura incidentally.
[5000.64 - 5004.64] P:1737.87 E:0.101518 |  Ericsson, Sable to play for to Son, first time touch, Ali back to Son,
[5004.64 - 5008.64] P:1563.10 E:0.105968 |  but that's blocked on the edge of the penalty area, Ericsson's got it back though, he's on his right foot,
[5008.64 - 5013.64] P:1685.89 E:0.098267 |  he shoots from the angle, it hits Van Dijk's ankles and bounces out to the far side,
[5013.64 - 5016.64] P:1672.40 E:0.099675 |  Tottenham still pressing from right to left, Ericsson's low ball across,
[5016.64 - 5023.64] P:1731.37 E:0.108775 |  Jallialli tried to, one of those flicks, he was running at taste, he tried to get it right to Son,
[5023.64 - 5025.64] P:1623.57 E:0.101343 |  but over-hitted through for a goal kick.
[5025.64 - 5030.64] P:1666.94 E:0.100690 |  But you feel it's building some good link-up play in and around the edge of the box,
[5030.64 - 5033.64] P:1694.91 E:0.089310 |  Ericsson just choking on his shot again.
[5033.64 - 5037.64] P:1431.79 E:0.096951 |  Much more Tottenham way, you know the zip in the pass, the energy to the side,
[5037.64 - 5041.64] P:1422.56 E:0.100188 |  you feel him, like they often get three around the D of the box, you know, to work in from that area,
[5041.64 - 5046.64] P:1502.93 E:0.086739 |  and then the wide men come out, the full-backs coming on from there, much more like Tottenham at the moment.
[5046.64 - 5048.64] P:1552.03 E:0.110446 |  James Melner's going to come on very shortly.
[5048.64 - 5053.64] P:1605.44 E:0.092587 |  I will say, without being in major trouble in the ball, I think they have got to just start finding some passages of play,
[5053.64 - 5057.64] P:1449.65 E:0.102180 |  just control the game a little bit more in possession, you know, for yet again teams of this quality,
[5057.64 - 5060.64] P:1325.16 E:0.094357 |  they have real quality, they're not just a counter-attack side, we know that,
[5060.64 - 5065.64] P:1440.55 E:0.098614 |  just find them passages of play, just absorb the game, not in a defensive way, with the ball.
[5065.64 - 5068.64] P:1617.30 E:0.106857 |  I think that Jürgen Klopp's made the two changes in a very short space of time,
[5068.64 - 5071.64] P:1340.62 E:0.098570 |  who probably tells you that he's thinking the same thing.
[5071.64 - 5076.64] P:1343.23 E:0.093037 |  Melner still waiting to come on though, ball in play, put that strictly the arm of Henderson,
[5076.64 - 5082.64] P:1631.28 E:0.103626 |  as he was challenged by Rose, and then Henderson is sort of held down by Rose as he was falling anyway,
[5082.64 - 5087.64] P:1745.77 E:0.085449 |  he's off the field, and so while it is out for a throw, it is Vijn Alden,
[5087.64 - 5092.64] P:1789.62 E:0.107027 |  who will leave the field, score of two of the goals against Barcelona,
[5092.64 - 5095.64] P:1699.33 E:0.113522 |  and Vijn Alden will be replaced by James Melner.
[5095.64 - 5104.64] P:1710.27 E:0.108559 |  Yep, I mean he's worked hard for Melnalden, such a big player, big goals against Barcelona,
[5104.64 - 5109.64] P:1678.75 E:0.097436 |  but Melner, I think that was the one decision early which Klopp had to make, and he left.
[5109.64 - 5112.64] P:1495.97 E:0.067592 |  James Melner out, gets his opportunity now.
[5112.64 - 5117.64] P:1583.22 E:0.093307 |  Ritjopochtitino still yet to make a change, and as I say, as far as I can tell from here,
[5117.64 - 5128.64] P:1587.63 E:0.093182 |  no immediate sign of one being made, as Tottenham concede a free kick on the half-way line for a foul on Matip.
[5128.64 - 5135.64] P:1444.82 E:0.095164 |  We are now into the final, 30 minutes of this Champions League final, with Liverpool leading by one goal to 0.
[5135.64 - 5141.64] P:1639.71 E:0.081639 |  I'm slightly surprised that he hasn't made a change, we know in Ajax half-time, ruthless,
[5141.64 - 5148.64] P:1515.22 E:0.074391 |  but the ball went through, and Laurenti came on, I know there were three down at that stage.
[5148.64 - 5152.64] P:1567.30 E:0.112413 |  And he's seen signs though, maybe seen signs, he's seen enough signs.
[5152.64 - 5157.64] P:1663.16 E:0.104945 |  Henderson back to Origi, Origi plays at round one side of Fatonghen, but he won't reach that,
[5157.64 - 5160.64] P:1776.82 E:0.102249 |  and the ball bounces away through for a goal kick.
[5160.64 - 5168.64] P:1589.60 E:0.096627 |  A goal kick to Tottenham, I will tell you when the lines are open for 4-6-0-6, it won't be long to talk to Robbie Savage and Steve Crossman,
[5168.64 - 5172.64] P:1569.09 E:0.100361 |  who are now co-presenting breakfast on five-lives in the morning from here in Madrid.
[5172.64 - 5178.64] P:1777.76 E:0.107186 |  It may even if he really starts to think about going for it, Chris, I wonder whether he could take his eye quite at all wings,
[5178.64 - 5183.64] P:1763.03 E:0.106445 |  and then put Ali and Ericsson in there, put more of coming off a wide position to drive the people.
[5183.64 - 5190.64] P:1685.67 E:0.105329 |  Going for a very, very technical high-scoring front unit, I just hope to not get them on transition, obviously.
[5190.64 - 5196.64] P:1555.96 E:0.105387 |  Rose inside his own half-plazard through the legs of Alexander-Arnold, then Delhi-Ali's pass forward is beyond the run of Sond,
[5196.64 - 5201.64] P:1634.00 E:0.093372 |  and actually, as well, Van Dyke came across and just dealt with it.
[5201.64 - 5203.64] P:1591.56 E:0.097745 |  Just dealt with it, brilliant.
[5203.64 - 5212.64] P:1601.21 E:0.107449 |  PFA player of the year, Premier League player of the year, ball bouncing downfield for last year's Man of the Year, Salah,
[5212.64 - 5218.64] P:1707.34 E:0.109140 |  who goes tumbling to the ground, Fatonghen was right there with him, no free kick,
[5218.64 - 5223.64] P:1688.35 E:0.089078 |  referee was back on the half-way line, but was adamant, and Fatonghen wasn't impressed.
[5223.64 - 5231.64] P:1674.92 E:0.088329 |  Here's Sosoko in the centre-circle, Sosoko, such a strong man, Fabinho is moving towards him, though,
[5231.64 - 5235.64] P:1615.46 E:0.103343 |  so he goes back into his own half-wings, he's being put under pressure here by Henderson,
[5235.64 - 5241.64] P:1694.15 E:0.114074 |  and the ball will go all the way back through Alderviro to go keep out Lloris, Liverpool leading 1-0.
[5241.64 - 5251.64] P:1603.34 E:0.108225 |  Now it's the Liverpool fans with the roar urging their team on, they know what's at stake, they know they're not far away.
[5251.64 - 5256.64] P:1531.09 E:0.113812 |  Here he comes, Chris, Lucas Moura has suddenly appeared, we can see his number 27 shirt down there,
[5256.64 - 5263.64] P:1557.82 E:0.098651 |  as Harry Kane concedes a free kick against Fabinho near the centre-circle, so now is the time,
[5263.64 - 5272.64] P:1472.70 E:0.087130 |  now is the time with 25 minutes of the final to go, Mauricio Pochettino, he called him a superhero in Amsterdam,
[5272.64 - 5280.64] P:1502.23 E:0.095132 |  he's got his hand around the back of his shoulders, final instructions, and Lucas Moura moves towards the half-way line.
[5280.64 - 5287.64] P:1466.44 E:0.099199 |  Question is, whose number is going to go up, and it is Harry Winks, it is Harry Winks who will make way from central midfield.
[5287.64 - 5298.64] P:1671.43 E:0.099388 |  There you go, and there is a roll of the dice, absolutely all in now, he's gone for it.
[5298.64 - 5305.64] P:1682.87 E:0.107472 |  So who's going where now? Deli Ali drops back into a deeper position.
[5305.64 - 5310.64] P:1617.50 E:0.109334 |  I think Ericsson looks like he's dropping in a little bit deeper.
[5310.64 - 5315.64] P:1596.04 E:0.085750 |  They're diving forwards to Soco, playing more like the one who has to do the work in front of the back full particularly on turnover,
[5315.64 - 5318.64] P:1505.13 E:0.092647 |  of course mainly in front of the two centre-hills, the two full backs going on.
[5318.64 - 5322.64] P:1566.48 E:0.084709 |  I think they'll try and rotate a little bit in Ericsson, he can do it in there, he can play from there,
[5322.64 - 5325.64] P:1525.69 E:0.073244 |  and he can definitely deliver from there, we know that.
[5325.64 - 5331.64] P:1546.93 E:0.092151 |  That's what they did in Amsterdam wasn't it, in the latter stages as well, when Ericsson orchestrated everything.
[5331.64 - 5334.64] P:1610.24 E:0.091382 |  Getting your technicians out there, getting your technicians in the middle of the pitch,
[5334.64 - 5337.64] P:1645.31 E:0.091324 |  which Tottenham are now beginning to get more bodies into the middle of the pitch,
[5337.64 - 5339.64] P:1538.64 E:0.092422 |  which they do well when they're really playing well.
[5339.64 - 5344.64] P:1633.29 E:0.100236 |  Moura got his first touch, but it just bounced off him, and Liverpool have got it back, all in red, in the half-two hour left.
[5344.64 - 5350.64] P:1691.19 E:0.088279 |  When Moura ran on, he spoke to Kane, and he spoke to Son, and currently he's quite central Moura.
[5350.64 - 5356.64] P:1647.30 E:0.104702 |  But it's Liverpool in possession, Mane, now to the right-hand side, Alexander-Arnold arrives on the ball and plays it in,
[5356.64 - 5361.64] P:1662.66 E:0.120220 |  another one of those Alexander-Arnold balls curling at neck height,
[5361.64 - 5364.64] P:1662.38 E:0.109804 |  and Aldervire Old Stooping had to head it behind for a corner to Liverpool.
[5364.64 - 5371.64] P:1506.51 E:0.098659 |  Another Alexander-Arnold exoset on the right-hand side, his delivery is a lot of time.
[5371.64 - 5375.64] P:1498.70 E:0.101894 |  Yeah, they are, Iman Robinson, their delivery asks questions all the time in the back four,
[5375.64 - 5378.64] P:1411.17 E:0.079925 |  and it really puts doubt in the back four's mind.
[5380.64 - 5385.64] P:1576.21 E:0.104828 |  And this time it is Alexander-Arnold, who very precisely places the ball in the quadrant.
[5386.64 - 5392.64] P:1594.10 E:0.093420 |  Four strides back, plays it into the near post, straight at Son, who's able to volley it straight out of play,
[5392.64 - 5398.64] P:1374.24 E:0.093646 |  and it was caught, actually, by one of the substitutes down there, who throws it back to Alexander-Arnold.
[5398.64 - 5404.64] P:1312.67 E:0.108176 |  Less than 25 minutes to go, Tottenham nil, Liverpool won, long throw by Alexander-Arnold,
[5404.64 - 5410.64] P:1565.47 E:0.096353 |  that was the last ditch stretch by Fertonghen, otherwise Milner might have been in along the dead ball line,
[5410.64 - 5413.64] P:1469.51 E:0.099090 |  but he did get there, the Belgian, and cleared it out of play.
[5413.64 - 5419.64] P:1398.36 E:0.093118 |  Another Liverpool throw, Alexander-Arnold plays it, and that will just bounce away through for a goal kick.
[5419.64 - 5428.64] P:1339.14 E:0.098641 |  So one nil, Liverpool lead, the very early goal from the penalty spot by Mohamed Salah, five-live, and the World Service, BBC London.
[5428.64 - 5436.64] P:1570.91 E:0.097337 |  So now it's a bit like Moura coming just off the pocket in my own cane, Ali this side, Somnia this side, still on the right-hand side,
[5436.64 - 5441.64] P:1563.89 E:0.091687 |  Chisoko still trying to drive out of midfield, with Ericsson now playing a deeper role when needed.
[5441.64 - 5448.64] P:1564.86 E:0.105944 |  Moura inside his own half in the centre-circle, Trippie has passed forward, though just bounces harmlessly out of play from a Liverpool point of view,
[5448.64 - 5453.64] P:1488.77 E:0.085213 |  Chisoko trying to reach it, and Liverpool with the throw halfway inside their own half.
[5453.64 - 5459.64] P:1454.17 E:0.093338 |  See, if you've got the legs up there, which, you know, with particularly more can drive forwards, Ali coming off the other side,
[5459.64 - 5464.64] P:1489.99 E:0.101115 |  Som coming off the side, you want Ericsson to get in the quarter-back position, you want him to get his head up,
[5464.64 - 5468.64] P:1443.10 E:0.091499 |  and then he can find things, because he can find things, there's no two ways about it, he can find that killer pass.
[5468.64 - 5475.64] P:1640.76 E:0.103647 |  Mane for Liverpool, who's forced out wide, out towards the right-hand side here by Ericsson who went with him,
[5475.64 - 5483.64] P:1578.80 E:0.113753 |  but then Mane sets off infield, goes past Ericsson, and then as Daly Ali comes in, gives it to Salah, who teed up Milner,
[5483.64 - 5488.64] P:1771.29 E:0.111855 |  who's shot with a left foot from inside the D, was a foot wide of the foot of the post.
[5488.64 - 5493.64] P:1696.41 E:0.110794 |  And seeing James Milner's face, he thinks he should have scored, brilliant from Mane,
[5493.64 - 5498.64] P:1649.31 E:0.098826 |  surging run from left to right, and then he just chops inside Ericsson,
[5498.64 - 5504.64] P:1614.42 E:0.092844 |  who looks like he's towing a caravan, can't get near him, he feeds the ball into Salah, who lays it back,
[5504.64 - 5511.64] P:1681.37 E:0.094396 |  and Milner, what, 17 yards out, Larisse isn't stopping that, he goes inches past the left-hand post.
[5512.64 - 5516.64] P:1810.58 E:0.091189 |  That is the clearest chance of the second half.
[5516.64 - 5522.64] P:1876.57 E:0.095502 |  Yeah, just tried to feed it, nice lay back from Salah.
[5522.64 - 5528.64] P:1848.54 E:0.101570 |  Mane again, Chris looking a threat, you know, like he does, he's electric when he gets on it, he can turn,
[5528.64 - 5534.64] P:1793.96 E:0.093900 |  he can drive at you, and he can play, it's a fine plan, brilliant, brilliant second half of the season without Del.
[5534.64 - 5540.64] P:1660.50 E:0.095256 |  Long ball over the top four, Tottenham, Daly Ali bounces back, and here is Harry Kane now,
[5540.64 - 5549.64] P:1613.15 E:0.102558 |  taking the ball to the corner of the penalty area, out wide, roses ball in, clearance from Madib strikes Milner inside the penalty area,
[5549.64 - 5557.64] P:1491.41 E:0.097931 |  the Tottenham fans are bellowing and pleading for a handball, but absolutely nothing doing,
[5557.64 - 5561.64] P:1498.81 E:0.096960 |  and Tottenham are able to play it all the way back to the other end to Larisse.
[5561.64 - 5564.64] P:1715.11 E:0.102953 |  Shaky wasn't it from Liverpool, who missed the clearance, was it Matip?
[5564.64 - 5568.64] P:1504.93 E:0.087416 |  Look how open they are now, the two midfielders coming off in front of the two centre-hairs,
[5568.64 - 5571.64] P:1545.97 E:0.096285 |  causing almost four men in the box in front of the two centre-hairs for Tottenham,
[5571.64 - 5577.64] P:1547.17 E:0.095262 |  the two fullbacks now driving forwards, filling the middle of the pitch, particularly in an attacking sense, Tottenham.
[5577.64 - 5581.64] P:1535.05 E:0.102156 |  Still though, I make it that Allyson has not had a save to make.
[5581.64 - 5585.64] P:1678.32 E:0.095286 |  No, absolutely, Sparney, they've still got to get in there with quality.
[5585.64 - 5589.64] P:1590.25 E:0.096422 |  And on the little stats board, I'll come back to that, because Spurs played down the right-hand side,
[5589.64 - 5595.64] P:1623.30 E:0.113620 |  looking good, pulls the ball right across the penalty area, reaches Rose in the other fullback position.
[5595.64 - 5598.64] P:1671.08 E:0.107635 |  Rose chips it across to the back post, Moura couldn't get there,
[5598.64 - 5605.64] P:1691.57 E:0.111123 |  Trippias got the ball on the right, though, Trippias cross is easily caught by a leaping Allyson on the edge of his six-yard box.
[5605.64 - 5610.64] P:1597.87 E:0.106778 |  Well, they get in behind the Liverpool back line, wonderful pass, and here's Salah.
[5610.64 - 5618.64] P:1678.58 E:0.113051 |  Allyson has hit a raking ball, Long Downfield, Salah's caught up with it, Salah plays it across, takes a deflection,
[5618.64 - 5624.64] P:1677.55 E:0.111849 |  Mane, and then Aldervireld, just as Mane took the ball on when he was about to shoot,
[5624.64 - 5628.64] P:1674.07 E:0.099129 |  Aldervireld whacked that out to the far side for Thromp.
[5628.64 - 5632.64] P:1546.51 E:0.100027 |  Well, talk about the game opening up, within the blink of an eye,
[5632.64 - 5638.64] P:1652.81 E:0.095587 |  Allyson releases Salah, one long ball in behind, gets to the byline, pokes it back,
[5638.64 - 5644.64] P:1708.46 E:0.088028 |  and Mane, bursting into the box, just takes a heavy touch, a better touch,
[5644.64 - 5648.64] P:1652.03 E:0.083397 |  and there would have been an easy finish, end to end now.
[5648.64 - 5650.64] P:1358.24 E:0.064817 |  Trippias is...
[5650.64 - 5652.64] P:1545.82 E:0.103184 |  Salah said, can they capitalise on it?
[5652.64 - 5656.64] P:1534.49 E:0.090021 |  Tottenham got to ask them questions, that was twice there, fall back to fall back,
[5656.64 - 5659.64] P:1463.74 E:0.077406 |  and then fall back to fall back from Tottenham, they're that high at the pitch now,
[5659.64 - 5662.64] P:1521.93 E:0.090900 |  they're opening up the pitch, but they've got to do that, but they might get caught, obviously.
[5662.64 - 5665.64] P:1509.54 E:0.095018 |  With three Tottenham players on the ground, or two on the ground,
[5665.64 - 5669.64] P:1558.13 E:0.084004 |  Trippias looks as though he might have a problem with his left thigh possibly,
[5669.64 - 5673.64] P:1548.09 E:0.087006 |  Sococo was down, So was Rose, we've got a stoppage here,
[5673.64 - 5678.64] P:1590.47 E:0.088108 |  so the water bottles have been produced in these very warm temperatures in Madrid,
[5678.64 - 5683.64] P:1524.17 E:0.079961 |  and Mauricio Pochettino and his medical staff, his paraise is down there as well,
[5683.64 - 5686.64] P:1507.80 E:0.086386 |  one of his assistants, are just trying to monitor the situation,
[5686.64 - 5692.64] P:1543.52 E:0.089075 |  I think Trippias has signalled that he's OK, throwing two Liverpool on the far side,
[5692.64 - 5697.64] P:1484.87 E:0.085528 |  Liverpool still leading by one goal to nil, here's Auregie on the left-hand side,
[5697.64 - 5701.64] P:1469.69 E:0.093348 |  substitute Auregie, bounces off him into throwing to Tottenham,
[5701.64 - 5705.64] P:1595.42 E:0.092532 |  and actually now the statistics show that Alisson, who's not had a save to make,
[5705.64 - 5710.64] P:1507.00 E:0.086830 |  is now the Liverpool player with most passes completed in the match,
[5710.64 - 5719.64] P:1663.01 E:0.087620 |  fall back to Lloris, oh flicked it past Salah, that was so close to actually hitting Salah,
[5719.64 - 5724.64] P:1487.07 E:0.083668 |  it didn't though, he got it away the Tottenham goalkeeper, one nil Liverpool lead,
[5724.64 - 5729.64] P:1607.26 E:0.096473 |  they are less than 20 minutes away now, Liverpool from a sixth European title,
[5729.64 - 5732.64] P:1493.10 E:0.107017 |  Fabinho playing the ball through the middle,
[5732.64 - 5735.64] P:1519.73 E:0.093458 |  Trippias wide open there, I don't know why they're popping it into midfield,
[5735.64 - 5738.64] P:1497.55 E:0.100398 |  he's wide open, they've got to use that, they've got to get Rose on the ball,
[5738.64 - 5742.64] P:1569.93 E:0.093740 |  Trippias so high now, he's almost playing like an absolute old-fashioned winger.
[5742.64 - 5747.64] P:1685.15 E:0.105432 |  Lovely flick from Son, Kane gives it back to Son, Son now to Ali, Ali chips it in,
[5747.64 - 5753.64] P:1632.02 E:0.107066 |  but not with enough pace, and it is actually caught quite comfortably by the back pedaling,
[5753.64 - 5755.64] P:1777.77 E:0.109298 |  Alisson in his six-yard box.
[5755.64 - 5758.64] P:1820.38 E:0.100417 |  It's so close down, but something's going to give eventually in this game,
[5758.64 - 5763.64] P:1713.60 E:0.095252 |  lovely build-up play, Son and Kane involved, and then Son feeds the ball out to Dele Alli,
[5763.64 - 5767.64] P:1726.95 E:0.085657 |  is inside the box on the left-hand side, 16 yards out,
[5767.64 - 5773.64] P:1702.25 E:0.090236 |  you can see the idea, he's dragged it, lift it, bend it, over Alisson into the far corner,
[5773.64 - 5777.64] P:1657.93 E:0.079318 |  all he does is he loops it up, do we call that a save?
[5777.64 - 5781.64] P:1620.23 E:0.084529 |  I was just going to ask you the same question, I think I probably called it a catch,
[5781.64 - 5785.64] P:1583.69 E:0.105828 |  but Dyer's going to come on, and it looks as though that's it for Sosoko.
[5786.64 - 5792.64] P:1605.66 E:0.113191 |  Another poor supporters, it's quite tense this now with just the one goal,
[5792.64 - 5799.64] P:1551.30 E:0.113297 |  it's not been the display of flowing football that we hoped for,
[5799.64 - 5803.64] P:1660.04 E:0.110619 |  but when you have a 1-0 match like this, when the stakes are so high,
[5803.64 - 5806.64] P:1575.50 E:0.101295 |  then you know that tension is going to come into it, and that's what we've got now.
[5806.64 - 5810.64] P:1467.98 E:0.081791 |  I wonder now, with Dyer coming on by the way, I think that will release Ericsson possibly,
[5810.64 - 5814.64] P:1425.00 E:0.086859 |  he chooses to do that, releasing further forwards, we'll have to wait and see what it might do.
[5815.64 - 5821.64] P:1530.09 E:0.090747 |  So another Englishman joins the fray for the All-English final, 1972 by the way,
[5821.64 - 5827.64] P:1552.34 E:0.083149 |  they were all British or Irish, all 22, ball down the left-hand side for Liverpool,
[5827.64 - 5832.64] P:1482.49 E:0.092043 |  Milner takes it on, but that will be seen behind by Aldervire Old, Milner slid in,
[5832.64 - 5838.64] P:1627.11 E:0.095916 |  but it is a goal-kick for Tottenham, urgency now, four spurs, 15 minutes, just over 15 minutes to play.
[5840.64 - 5846.64] P:1498.06 E:0.111222 |  The lines are open now for 6-0-6, 08, 08, 05, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, text 85058,
[5846.64 - 5851.64] P:1410.32 E:0.104659 |  or get in touch, hashtag BBC 6-0-6 to talk to Robbie Savage,
[5851.64 - 5856.64] P:1471.33 E:0.107556 |  they'll have Steve Crossman alongside him here in Madrid for the phone-in tonight.
[5856.64 - 5861.64] P:1498.89 E:0.101978 |  Here's Danny Rose now, chesting the ball near the half-way line, Henderson with the challenge,
[5861.64 - 5866.64] P:1569.21 E:0.108998 |  but now Deli Alley for spurs, Lucas Moura plays it across, but that's intercepted by Robertson,
[5866.64 - 5871.64] P:1605.72 E:0.106033 |  took it away from Trippier, and now Liverpool coming forward, Robertson playing at the salar,
[5871.64 - 5874.64] P:1732.82 E:0.100269 |  salar just outside the box, gets it under his left foot, chips it into the penalty area,
[5874.64 - 5879.64] P:1598.27 E:0.107686 |  headed away by Aldervire Old, a Reagy challenging for it on the edge of the box with Dyer,
[5879.64 - 5885.64] P:1610.52 E:0.103454 |  and it bounces down, and Lucas Moura now to Deli Alley, Alley helps it forward through the middle to Son,
[5885.64 - 5892.64] P:1625.62 E:0.116466 |  Son running at the Liverpool defence, and then Income's van die, wasting our wonderful challenge,
[5892.64 - 5896.64] P:1707.23 E:0.109996 |  well the pace, I thought he'd gone, I thought Son was past him.
[5896.64 - 5898.64] P:1588.37 E:0.081315 |  The second-hand-tons driving at him, he gets a great foot in there.
[5898.64 - 5902.64] P:1633.79 E:0.095865 |  Corner taken quickly by Tottenham, on the left-hand side, here is Kane,
[5902.64 - 5906.64] P:1711.81 E:0.097006 |  Kane goes past Henderson, on his left foot, drives it across to the near post, it's blocked,
[5906.64 - 5910.64] P:1703.08 E:0.099147 |  back to Kane, Kane curls it in towards the back post, no-one there for Tottenham,
[5910.64 - 5918.64] P:1670.00 E:0.081442 |  van Dijk headed it away for Liverpool, spurs now, suddenly, have upped the pace and pressure,
[5918.64 - 5924.64] P:1577.47 E:0.103522 |  ball right across, from right to left, Son takes it down, but the referee,
[5924.64 - 5929.64] P:1535.90 E:0.101003 |  I think a spot of a hand ball by Son as it bounced up and hit him, and it's a free kick to Liverpool.
[5929.64 - 5937.64] P:1533.14 E:0.085168 |  Alexander-Arnold switched off, he got lucky, but what about that foot race, Son and van Dijk?
[5937.64 - 5943.64] P:1555.15 E:0.098751 |  Do you know Rolls Royce for me? Is a Rolls Royce for me, van Dijk? Absolutely, he's hit the afterburner's air,
[5943.64 - 5949.64] P:1601.32 E:0.093717 |  and he drives after Son, and just too powerful, too strong, too quickly, fantastic defence.
[5949.64 - 5956.64] P:1443.13 E:0.098771 |  You know what, that little moment there, that sums up van Dijk's season and why he's received the awards that he has,
[5956.64 - 5962.64] P:1581.13 E:0.096390 |  and think back to the game between them, the Premier League, when van Dijk had two against one, Cisoko,
[5962.64 - 5970.64] P:1601.02 E:0.092398 |  the way that he defended that, and Cisoko hit it over the crossbar, two pivotal moments in those two matches, van Dijk at the heart of it.
[5970.64 - 5975.64] P:1625.59 E:0.090871 |  Do you know what's his heat, 30 degree heat? I bet he hasn't even broken sweat.
[5975.64 - 5979.64] P:1526.16 E:0.085242 |  I have. We noticed that early in the play.
[5979.64 - 5986.64] P:1528.13 E:0.097140 |  Robertson sends the ball forward, Loris comes out, now he has trippier on the right.
[5986.64 - 5991.64] P:1606.59 E:0.101520 |  The ball struck long, this is for Deli Alli to chase, but Allyson's there on the edge of the area,
[5991.64 - 5997.64] P:1581.03 E:0.094016 |  and takes a catch straight out of the cricket world cup, he took it, fingers up right in front of his neck.
[5997.64 - 6002.64] P:1488.23 E:0.083026 |  He's finding a start position there from Allyson, we all know he can make a save, but his start position there is fantastic.
[6002.64 - 6009.64] P:1542.91 E:0.095913 |  Watching the play from afar, taking up a high position along the box line, reading the play, clutching out the air without no problem.
[6009.64 - 6013.64] P:1500.58 E:0.094404 |  That's the way the Aussies catch. That's the Aussie style, isn't it? Yeah, fingers up.
[6013.64 - 6018.64] P:1578.95 E:0.103241 |  But I don't know about you, Sean, I think they've really changed the game, Edison and Allyson.
[6018.64 - 6023.64] P:1581.57 E:0.099753 |  You know, we've seen a different type of goalkeeping play from the two of them.
[6023.64 - 6027.64] P:1622.16 E:0.090953 |  The goalkeeping has been morphed for the last, probably, certainly five, if not ten years.
[6027.64 - 6032.64] P:1614.81 E:0.088872 |  You know, the different way that we're looking at goalkeeping now, and they certainly encapsulate both of them.
[6032.64 - 6039.64] P:1640.73 E:0.096349 |  1-0 to Liverpool, Tottenham 0-1. We're entering the final stages now, 12 minutes to go, plus added time.
[6039.64 - 6045.64] P:1628.55 E:0.088176 |  Tottenham need to find something dramatic. They have done that once or twice this season in the Champions League.
[6045.64 - 6049.64] P:1619.57 E:0.083634 |  Here's Ericsson, Ericsson now to Rose on the left-hand side.
[6049.64 - 6054.64] P:1758.80 E:0.091996 |  Rose, Milner comes across, Lucas Moura comes short, but Rose goes back to Ericsson.
[6054.64 - 6063.64] P:1836.85 E:0.102584 |  Ericsson ten yards inside the Liverpool half, just flexed across towards Alderviral, who actually goes backwards to Lloris.
[6063.64 - 6066.64] P:1793.14 E:0.110936 |  Groms from the 16,000 plus Tottenham fans.
[6066.64 - 6070.64] P:1664.12 E:0.098664 |  I wonder whether he's got to find a way to get Laurentiom, change the feel, give you a different view of it,
[6070.64 - 6074.64] P:1578.75 E:0.100089 |  give you a last little, you know, because playing in front of Liverpool at the moment,
[6074.64 - 6078.64] P:1478.90 E:0.098843 |  a team that have only, you know, 22 goals they considered in a season in the Premier League,
[6078.64 - 6082.64] P:1514.14 E:0.092307 |  they can do this, they can find, you know, the way of defending out a game.
[6082.64 - 6084.64] P:1682.61 E:0.104645 |  I just wonder whether there's got to be a different question asked.
[6084.64 - 6087.64] P:1600.46 E:0.090439 |  Although Tottenham are looking way, way more like themselves in my opinion.
[6087.64 - 6093.64] P:1656.62 E:0.109228 |  Kane, high, high pass from the left out to the right, Trippias ball in, is headed up and over the top of the crossbar.
[6093.64 - 6102.64] P:1655.55 E:0.092743 |  Deli Alley was under pressure from Matip and could only, under that pressure, headed up and all that.
[6102.64 - 6106.64] P:1612.05 E:0.086531 |  What a ball this is from Harry Kane.
[6106.64 - 6115.64] P:1763.94 E:0.093904 |  Left-hand side, big switch over Robertson, Liverpool left-back, Trippia, good first touch and he lifts it towards the far post.
[6115.64 - 6123.64] P:1689.84 E:0.100784 |  And Alley under pressure from Matip, just can't get his neck muscles working and direct it on target.
[6124.64 - 6132.64] P:1488.24 E:0.095929 |  11 minutes to play, Tottenham nil, Liverpool won but Spurs are coming on stronger.
[6132.64 - 6138.64] P:1589.62 E:0.098955 |  Sone, now with Alley, back to Sone, Sone running directly at the Liverpool defence but Van Dijk is there again.
[6138.64 - 6144.64] P:1554.39 E:0.107270 |  Turns, plays it up towards Origi in the centre-circle, Origi couldn't find the angle pass to Salah.
[6144.64 - 6148.64] P:1668.63 E:0.093177 |  Alderv-Irol stepped across and plays it back to his goalkeeper.
[6148.64 - 6149.64] P:1589.40 E:0.101803 |  Spurs start again.
[6149.64 - 6154.64] P:1508.67 E:0.094264 |  They're almost left to three up there, they've got to be careful with that.
[6154.64 - 6158.64] P:1535.39 E:0.095935 |  Tottenham are advancing, now's the time to get them Wipelers working back, working diligently.
[6158.64 - 6163.64] P:1468.82 E:0.097614 |  We're taking your calls now, 08, 08, 09, 09, 693 on 5-5 for 6-06.
[6163.64 - 6169.64] P:1555.38 E:0.107860 |  Here's Sone, 30 yards out, shoots, Allison goes down to his right, got a good sight on it, palmed it away.
[6169.64 - 6174.64] P:1612.61 E:0.117437 |  Tottenham come again, Lukas Moura in the middle, low shot saved down to his left by Allison.
[6174.64 - 6179.64] P:1626.62 E:0.117590 |  He's a bit of a tall poker by Lukas Moura, it lacked pace and it was saved.
[6179.64 - 6182.64] P:1693.69 E:0.109581 |  Yeah, but Spurs, aren't Spursy anymore?
[6182.64 - 6188.64] P:1669.60 E:0.095453 |  Well, Sone, 30 yards out, hammers the shot, you'd expect Allison to save it, right hand,
[6188.64 - 6194.64] P:1675.29 E:0.101183 |  strong hand, gets it away from goal and Moura, just not sharp enough, didn't get the purchase on the shot.
[6194.64 - 6196.64] P:1642.02 E:0.106451 |  He saved well down to his left-hand side.
[6196.64 - 6203.64] P:1612.93 E:0.095107 |  So Liverpool still lead by one goal to nil, but Spurs are testing Liverpool now and here comes Llorente.
[6203.64 - 6208.64] P:1590.89 E:0.096344 |  Llorente is being called forward, he has had the magic touch in the Champions League.
[6208.64 - 6215.64] P:1663.09 E:0.111139 |  Lovely from Sone, nutmeg for Beignor and he shoots left-footed with no power at all and it just rolls to Allison
[6215.64 - 6221.64] P:1561.03 E:0.103436 |  who can pick it up like a back pass, but he's just made now three saves in approximately 90 seconds, Allison.
[6221.64 - 6226.64] P:1649.96 E:0.104157 |  Fair play to Spurs, really giving it a go, pushing Liverpool back.
[6226.64 - 6230.64] P:1720.98 E:0.107243 |  Oh, and now Salah has forced Futongan at the other end.
[6230.64 - 6236.64] P:1654.35 E:0.104677 |  Just to make the mistake, it was a back pass to Lloris, but he put too much on it and it's a corner to Liverpool.
[6236.64 - 6242.64] P:1561.24 E:0.089820 |  Klopp will love that, Klopp will love that, just a small mistake like that, now it just gives him that, you know,
[6242.64 - 6245.64] P:1604.57 E:0.103241 |  couple of minutes, slow it down, calm the game down.
[6245.64 - 6248.64] P:1659.15 E:0.078885 |  Deli Alli off, Llorente on.
[6250.64 - 6254.64] P:1601.30 E:0.107309 |  Well, like I said, change the feel of it, you know, you get in towards last knockings now, we know that,
[6254.64 - 6257.64] P:1489.04 E:0.084369 |  can you change the feel, can you ask different questions now?
[6257.64 - 6260.64] P:1662.94 E:0.112707 |  Kicked over the water, bought the Lair, Deli Alli in frustration.
[6260.64 - 6267.64] P:1618.12 E:0.091492 |  He's had Spurs two chances in the second half, one with the chip, the weak chip and then the header over the top.
[6267.64 - 6278.64] P:1625.50 E:0.086474 |  Liverpool with the corner, guess what? They're in no hurry to take it, with eight minutes left of the 90 of this Champions League final
[6278.64 - 6281.64] P:1417.08 E:0.088303 |  and Liverpool leading by the Salah penalty.
[6281.64 - 6290.64] P:1651.76 E:0.086990 |  Milner has placed the ball outside the quadrant and was going to take the corner and then had to step forward and replace it.
[6290.64 - 6293.64] P:1593.69 E:0.074080 |  Surely he didn't do that on purpose.
[6293.64 - 6299.64] P:1666.58 E:0.091407 |  Milner with the corner to the near post, that's headed away by Son, comes out to Salah,
[6299.64 - 6306.64] P:1620.09 E:0.082576 |  chess it down, lifts a ball over the top, it's straight to Son who follies it into the centre circle.
[6306.64 - 6314.64] P:1572.29 E:0.094006 |  Robertson's underneath that, Henderson, Henderson is able to get away from two men and then...
[6314.64 - 6318.64] P:1736.51 E:0.105346 |  Do we call that a shot? He volleyed it, goalwards and it went out of place.
[6318.64 - 6324.64] P:1564.33 E:0.102549 |  Tottenham now much more urgent now, look at Lewis, get the hand on the ball, you know, change the tempo again, keep changing the tempo,
[6324.64 - 6326.64] P:1430.03 E:0.091462 |  looking much more like Tottenham than we know.
[6326.64 - 6334.64] P:1702.12 E:0.093253 |  Mertio Pochettino has peeled off his black jacket and he's rolled up his sleeves, if anything, told you about his mood
[6334.64 - 6338.64] P:1759.46 E:0.088971 |  and the way that Tottenham are approaching this now, that is it.
[6338.64 - 6345.64] P:1498.74 E:0.110040 |  One nil Liverpool lead but Tottenham are finishing strongly and Dyer now to Ericsson.
[6345.64 - 6349.64] P:1363.34 E:0.104970 |  They've got to keep working the ball wide, they've got to keep doing that and asking questions from across some positions.
[6349.64 - 6354.64] P:1489.53 E:0.119288 |  High cross from Trippie, that's headed away by Alexander-Arnold, Ben Milner into the challenge, the ball's still in the box,
[6354.64 - 6361.64] P:1552.86 E:0.110354 |  Jarente, the referee just waited to see what was going to happen there and he's brought it back for the Tottenham free kick after the challenge on him.
[6361.64 - 6363.64] P:1526.46 E:0.095014 |  I think we'll see him then, check.
[6363.64 - 6368.64] P:1494.37 E:0.101469 |  He might be consulting VAR here about the nature of that challenge.
[6368.64 - 6371.64] P:1560.01 E:0.086919 |  That looked very, very close to me.
[6371.64 - 6379.64] P:1617.95 E:0.082214 |  Is he inside the box or outside? No, I think the contact is just, I want to say just.
[6379.64 - 6385.64] P:1450.12 E:0.092342 |  Yeah, it's a penalty check, but it was outside of the penalty area, high foot from Milner on Rose.
[6385.64 - 6388.64] P:1530.13 E:0.102824 |  It's lucky Milner, very, very lucky.
[6389.64 - 6391.64] P:1274.86 E:0.084868 |  Free kick chance.
[6393.64 - 6399.64] P:1496.69 E:0.088532 |  And we have got less than seven minutes to play.
[6400.64 - 6402.64] P:1734.28 E:0.104049 |  It's deadly from here, isn't it, Ericsson?
[6402.64 - 6405.64] P:1646.10 E:0.098864 |  It's that shape he needs to get, that shape we know he can do.
[6405.64 - 6409.64] P:1545.10 E:0.084370 |  Ask questions to get a touch or it misses everyone and goes in the corner.
[6409.64 - 6414.64] P:1489.70 E:0.098422 |  You can tell he loves the look of this as well, the way that he's bouncing around on the balls of his feet and his orange boots.
[6414.64 - 6420.64] P:1554.13 E:0.094579 |  No, I agree, he'll have it. So many of these in training, you know, practicing this shape, getting the delivery right, getting the pace on it.
[6420.64 - 6423.64] P:1616.39 E:0.095911 |  It's near the left corner of the box, just in the full-back position.
[6423.64 - 6428.64] P:1626.14 E:0.096673 |  Two-man wall, Salah looking over his shoulder at Ericsson, Ericsson waiting, one foot in front of the other.
[6428.64 - 6432.64] P:1692.96 E:0.096276 |  Liverpool leading one nil in the Champions League final, time running out for Tottenham.
[6432.64 - 6441.64] P:1659.93 E:0.102343 |  Ericsson, the blonde-haired Dane, stares at the ball, comes up with, whips it in and Ericsson, diving for his last, pushed it away beyond the far post.
[6442.64 - 6453.64] P:1691.11 E:0.102877 |  Great pace on the ball and Harry Kane, clever, I'd say clever, cute, he takes a risky, pushes Robertson over, it's a good save from Alisson, big hand round the post.
[6455.64 - 6461.64] P:1539.98 E:0.090665 |  Corner to Tottenham then from the right-hand side, we've got just over five minutes to play now.
[6461.64 - 6470.64] P:1576.70 E:0.096123 |  Harry Kane, just beyond the penalty spot, corner being taken from the right flank, run us to the near post, here's the delivery and it's flick going!
[6471.64 - 6484.64] P:1613.18 E:0.104788 |  Over the top of the back post, what a chance, Son was standing just next to the post and when it was knotted down to him, the flag was up.
[6484.64 - 6498.64] P:1611.46 E:0.110762 |  Well, I don't think he knew Son, he was offside, but what a miss, he didn't know the ball knocked down into the floor and he must be two yards out and he heads it over with the correct call from the assistant.
[6498.64 - 6511.64] P:1509.40 E:0.106880 |  Lucas Moura with the initial header and then Son headed it over, he was a yard out but the offside flag, it would not have stood and now Liverpool up towards Salah who tried to turn with the ball but it just evaded him and ran through the long run.
[6511.64 - 6519.64] P:1571.12 E:0.097337 |  So it's interesting now, Liverpool are making them forced, Arizona, they're giving out white sheet, they're making things like that where they should be, usually they contain that situation.
[6519.64 - 6539.64] P:1551.99 E:0.094097 |  Anxious, nervy moments and we are now into the last five minutes, Tottenham nil, Liverpool one, Liverpool chasing a sixth European Champions Cup or Champions League title, Robertson down the left playing it in and Rose not sure of where Salah was actually just went down, chested it behind for a Liverpool corner.
[6540.64 - 6558.64] P:1574.41 E:0.081665 |  Do you know what, I think he did the right thing. If you're unsure, take responsibility and put it out and Robertson again, his crossing is so good, I think he should have left it Rose, take no chances.
[6558.64 - 6587.64] P:1526.77 E:0.100305 |  So it's a corner for Liverpool from the right and Alderviral, that's actually just off the field on the half way line so Tottenham are having to defend this corner without one of their central defenders, Milner's waiting to take it, Tottenham for Tongan is trying to persuade the referee to allow Alderviral back onto the field and he is, I think there was some blood there and I think he had to change his shirt and he is being allowed back onto the field so they will be able to take it.
[6588.64 - 6610.64] P:1594.51 E:0.099715 |  So he has to defend the corner with the full complement, Milner with the corner for Liverpool who lead one nil, Milner waiting to take this little false start then here he comes into the near post, Son got his head to it, Van Dyke swung a leg at it, it was blocked, then a challenge on the edge of the box, Oregi left footed shot, he scored, Oregi makes it two nil to Liverpool.
[6610.64 - 6639.64] P:1580.28 E:0.120100 |  What an end to the season for this young Bolton, he has come to the four for Liverpool when it has really, really mattered, two goals against Barcelona, remember the goal that he scored against Everton, remember the goal that he scored against Newcastle, well now Divock Oregi surely has won the Champions League.
[6640.64 - 6644.64] P:1583.39 E:0.112820 |  So Liverpool in Madrid two nil.
[6644.64 - 6669.64] P:1528.63 E:0.115979 |  Now outstanding Oregi, super sub Oregi, transformed this Liverpool team against Barcelona and a game tonight, what a big player he's been, Spurs don't deal with the corner, Van Dyke has a goal and then the ball is poked out wide to him and he takes a touch with his right foot and left footed hammers the ball.
[6669.64 - 6677.64] P:1564.44 E:0.104998 |  Oregi, across the race into the far corner, it's Liverpool's Champions League now and Oregi's the man.
[6680.64 - 6698.64] P:1638.70 E:0.102383 |  Deadly finish from the angle, 12-13 yards, precision inside the foot of the post, Divock Oregi as Milner is challenged, Rose got the ball as well, Rose swings it in and it bounces off the chest of Urenti and wider than the post for a corner but two nil.
[6699.64 - 6704.64] P:1507.44 E:0.111637 |  Two nil with 90 seconds of the 90 minutes left.
[6704.64 - 6718.64] P:1653.20 E:0.110460 |  And do you know what happened for the last couple of seasons, it's always been about Liverpool's front three, you know, could they rely on anybody else? What a big game player he's been, got his chance, he's taken his chance.
[6718.64 - 6735.64] P:1497.21 E:0.110038 |  And Liverpool are going to make their final substitution of the 90 minutes. It's going to be Joel Gomez coming on to take over from Trent Alexander-Arnold as right back and now we have Liverpool's celebrations.
[6736.64 - 6751.64] P:1604.85 E:0.110764 |  They are dancing in the stands. It is all red to our right. There is a red smoke bomb being released there and that red smoke is drifting now towards the roof of the Metropolitan and out into the Spanish night.
[6752.64 - 6770.64] P:1440.77 E:0.105582 |  And Liverpool actually, it's Sadio Mane who has left the field so it was going to be Trent Alexander-Arnold. He came across and received instructions and Sadio Mane is the player who leaves the field and Alexander-Arnold has gone forward with Gomez at right back.
[6770.64 - 6778.64] P:1500.80 E:0.100752 |  And now the ball over the top, it's Salah in an offside position so it's a free kick on the edge of the box. We have 15 seconds of the 90 minutes to play.
[6778.64 - 6788.64] P:1442.04 E:0.112096 |  Liverpool scored in the second minute, the Salah penalty and they scored in the 87th. A one right at the start and one very near the end.
[6788.64 - 6798.64] P:1501.47 E:0.112060 |  And five minutes of added time will be played but it's going to be five minutes of celebration unless Tottenham now we talk about Spurs digging deep, Chris.
[6798.64 - 6802.64] P:1484.95 E:0.112837 |  But this would top the lot if they were able to get themselves out of this hole.
[6802.64 - 6810.64] P:1472.06 E:0.101065 |  You're going into the world of another miracle now though aren't you? You're going into a world of things just dropping perfect for players, things just may be mistakes.
[6810.64 - 6818.64] P:1561.02 E:0.093634 |  Obviously staying there was a massive, massive ask now but we've seen miracles up and lately, see if we see another.
[6818.64 - 6822.64] P:1548.15 E:0.082037 |  Well we saw it with the last kick in Amsterdam.
[6822.64 - 6830.64] P:1604.82 E:0.110213 |  It's not felt like that, is it? To be fair to Liverpool they've contained it well, we know they're threat set pieces, we know they can make their mark.
[6830.64 - 6837.64] P:1525.71 E:0.101632 |  They'll be an overly brilliant but Tottenham have built into the game second half but you always worry do they get something from the game?
[6837.64 - 6843.64] P:1417.61 E:0.101737 |  They've found ways of scoring goals all season, they've found another way of scoring a goal there from a third phase of a set play.
[6843.64 - 6852.64] P:1465.00 E:0.104502 |  Tottenham 0, Liverpool 2. Lines are open for 6-06, Robbie Savage taking it, calls with, here comes Kane now on the left hand side.
[6852.64 - 6859.64] P:1600.25 E:0.110379 |  Kane into the penalty area, challenge comes in from Mattip, Kane goes down, referee ignores it and it's cleared away.
[6859.64 - 6866.64] P:1663.27 E:0.090050 |  He's king of the dives there Kane, he ships it and he throws himself to the floor, he shouldn't be doing that.
[6868.64 - 6875.64] P:1452.69 E:0.105050 |  08, 08-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, to talk to Robbie Savage, Steve Crossman with 6-06, here in Madrid.
[6875.64 - 6884.64] P:1444.16 E:0.107990 |  Mattip actually under no particular pressure, ball came across the penalty area, steers it away behind for a corner to Tottenham.
[6884.64 - 6893.64] P:1571.44 E:0.112623 |  Tottenham now, time running out very very quickly, we're in the second minute of 5 of added time, Liverpool are leading 2-0, corner from the right.
[6893.64 - 6901.64] P:1426.64 E:0.109192 |  Tottenham, packed the penalty area, here's the delivery in towards the near post and it's headed away and out for Liverpool, out towards the left hand side.
[6901.64 - 6908.64] P:1524.64 E:0.116590 |  Rose does well, he's on his right foot though, he shoots low but Allyson's able to go down and smother the ball comfortably into his chest.
[6908.64 - 6919.64] P:1525.69 E:0.117135 |  And Allyson hasn't been overly tested tonight but what he has had to do, he's done it very well, smart save, down to his right hand side, listen to this noise.
[6922.64 - 6933.64] P:1474.72 E:0.111164 |  It's a Liverpool noise, here in Madrid, Tottenham's first Champions League final looks like it's going to end in defeat but here they come again.
[6933.64 - 6940.64] P:1595.98 E:0.112989 |  And now Son shoots from the angle and Allyson goes down and scoops it with his left hand, wide of the far post.
[6940.64 - 6951.64] P:1550.13 E:0.106702 |  They don't know when to give up, Spurs, good shift from Son, left hand side of the box, left foot and Arrows are shot going in towards that far corner, it's a good hand from Allyson.
[6951.64 - 6962.64] P:1643.29 E:0.100215 |  Yet another corner from the right hand side for Tottenham, this one's headed away at the near post by Mattip, comes out for Spurs again, Rose, Rose drives it towards the edge of the box,
[6962.64 - 6970.64] P:1711.15 E:0.110374 |  Kane is there, Kane shoots left footed but this is straight at Allyson, who's now made a series of saves in the latter part of the second half.
[6970.64 - 6978.64] P:1645.58 E:0.103559 |  So good, isn't he Harry Kane, shifting the ball and getting a shot that gets good power but straight into Allyson's mid-drift.
[6980.64 - 6990.64] P:1529.36 E:0.100135 |  And the Liverpool goalkeeper is just keeping the ball and now just delivers it away, high downfield, that's beyond Salah, will bounce all the way through to Loris.
[6990.64 - 7001.64] P:1838.39 E:0.103658 |  We're in the fourth minute of added time, just over 90 seconds to play, Tottenham have got to find two goals in 90 seconds to take it to extra time.
[7001.64 - 7009.64] P:1400.06 E:0.118980 |  And they won't like this because Moura is beaten to the ball by Henderson who clears it out of play on the half way line.
[7009.64 - 7018.64] P:1269.19 E:0.118175 |  Jordan Henderson who might very soon join the list of Liverpool's European Cup or Champions League winning captains.
[7019.64 - 7028.64] P:1327.35 E:0.112437 |  Loris, the Tottenham captain, downfield from him, that's headed down and away by Van Dijk, now Somme, Somme 25 yards out, slipped the ball through Henderson's legs,
[7028.64 - 7035.64] P:1457.73 E:0.113394 |  Mattip is there though and is able to turn and chip it out of play. We are now in the fifth minute of added time.
[7035.64 - 7044.64] P:1474.16 E:0.108916 |  Eric Dyer on the left, right footed ball to the edge of the box, head height, not at away by Fabinho, it's won back for Spurs on the half way line, for Tongan forward,
[7044.64 - 7051.64] P:1633.08 E:0.108227 |  Matt's straight to Fabinho and Fabinho will just pass it forward to goal scorer, Origi, to the other goal scorer, Salah.
[7051.64 - 7058.64] P:1574.13 E:0.095521 |  And he's not going to take it towards the corner flag, Salah, I thought he might do, he's going to give it back to Origi,
[7058.64 - 7062.64] P:1703.77 E:0.097183 |  he's going to chip it forward towards Salah who won't reach that and it bounces through for a goal kick.
[7062.64 - 7065.64] P:1787.00 E:0.103016 |  And we are into the last 30 seconds now Chris Sutton.
[7065.64 - 7069.64] P:1949.10 E:0.102344 |  Yep, and all the Liverpool sobs are on their feet.
[7069.64 - 7072.64] P:1943.50 E:0.114804 |  Yeah, they're all getting ready now, Jack is in the technical area.
[7072.64 - 7083.64] P:1842.18 E:0.102335 |  Yep, this is going to end the wait for Liverpool since their last trophy success back in 2012 when Kenny Dalglesias Liverpool won the League Cup.
[7083.64 - 7096.64] P:1737.42 E:0.116689 |  It's been a long, long wait for Jurgen Klopp who's actually walking across now and there goes the final whistle as Jurgen Klopp shakes hands with the beaten Maurizio Pochettino
[7096.64 - 7102.64] P:1633.01 E:0.116953 |  and Liverpool's players, all of them race onto the field, some of them can't believe it.
[7102.64 - 7111.64] P:1650.27 E:0.115780 |  It's the Liverpool players who've dropped to the turf, they've won the Champions League, they're European champions for the sixth time.
[7111.64 - 7123.64] P:1728.80 E:0.107429 |  It's been a long wait for Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool to find success but they've got there in the end and they've got there with the biggest trophy of all.
[7123.64 - 7131.64] P:1642.01 E:0.101828 |  Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool win the Champions League in Madrid 2-0 against Tottenham.
[7131.64 - 7142.64] P:1682.04 E:0.111192 |  Yeah, and Jurgen Klopp conquers Europe and he said on his arrival at Liverpool four years ago he needed a trophy and he's fulfilled this promise.
[7142.64 - 7146.64] P:1692.47 E:0.105207 |  He has them with the biggest trophy of them all, the Champions League.
[7146.64 - 7155.64] P:1644.30 E:0.108663 |  Go back a season, go back to Kiev where they crumbled in Kiev, Klopp didn't allow them to feel sorry for themselves, didn't allow them to feel pity.
[7155.64 - 7162.64] P:1791.99 E:0.101448 |  He threw them out on the pitch this season, 97 points in the league, it wasn't good enough, they picked themselves up again.
[7162.64 - 7174.64] P:1770.12 E:0.100395 |  I'm going to tell you what, in Madrid, famous for his bullfighting, Matador Klopp, he didn't just grab the ball by the horns, he ripped and wrenched the horns off and he's a champion.
[7174.64 - 7176.64] P:1677.10 E:0.090880 |  They're the conquistadors.
[7178.64 - 7194.64] P:1547.75 E:0.114534 |  Another biggest difference for me just bringing a bit of calmness to it is simply for me, Liverpool this season, they've found ways when they've not been anywhere near as good as they can be to still win games, the tight games, the hard games, the one that it's not quite working for.
[7194.64 - 7200.64] P:1539.51 E:0.107419 |  Fantastic, absolutely fantastic what they delivered this season and deserve tonight overall.
[7200.64 - 7205.64] P:1715.90 E:0.107792 |  Liverpool have won it, Tottenham in their first Champions League final, its defeat.
[7205.64 - 7212.64] P:1750.80 E:0.100842 |  After all of their comebacks they've fallen at the final hurdle and they're being consoled by their Liverpool counterparts.
[7212.64 - 7219.64] P:1737.64 E:0.098072 |  The final score here in the 2019 Champions League final, Tottenham nil Liverpool 2.
[7219.64 - 7227.64] P:1713.24 E:0.105325 |  The Liverpool players jumping into each other's arms, Mahne into the arms of the coaching staff there and of course there's always the other side of the coin.
[7227.64 - 7240.64] P:1602.40 E:0.105322 |  Harry Kane staring vacantly up at the sky, swallowing hard, having a little think about what's happened in the last couple of hours while Mahne and Firmino hug and Liverpool have won it by two goals to nil.
[7240.64 - 7248.64] P:1605.00 E:0.101182 |  Sean Dice after a performance which by their highest standards you probably wouldn't give a much more than, I don't know what, seven out of ten?
[7248.64 - 7259.64] P:1669.52 E:0.103034 |  Really? That's the thing, you're looking at a team who, you know, but they've been fantastic, you know, and it's hard to turn up on these occasions and slick it about and play with all the detail that you normally would do.
[7259.64 - 7265.64] P:1686.87 E:0.100432 |  We spoke about the delay in the game, sorry, the build up to the game, how that would affect sides.
[7265.64 - 7273.64] P:1629.22 E:0.093417 |  I think both sides know they can play better without a doubt, but we equally said you've got to find a way to win and I think that's been the biggest difference in Liverpool this season.
[7273.64 - 7281.64] P:1673.61 E:0.097818 |  I really do, the ugly games, the hard games, the tight games, they've found a way to win them games and they've found a way to win it tonight and overall deservedly so.
[7281.64 - 7290.64] P:1774.38 E:0.099539 |  Pochettino and Henderson having a little cuddle here, Henderson has just gone up to Harry Kane, of course they'll be joining up with England tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
[7290.64 - 7293.64] P:1715.37 E:0.089044 |  Sean, if I sent you man of the match, I'd go for Van Dyke.
[7293.64 - 7295.64] P:1631.95 E:0.092916 |  Yeah, it's got to be Van Dyke for me.
[7295.64 - 7297.64] P:1772.00 E:0.119324 |  Not just for that one moment.
[7297.64 - 7301.64] P:1608.70 E:0.105070 |  No, no, no, he's just control the way he's now become the leader.
[7301.64 - 7310.64] P:1523.88 E:0.096969 |  I think he's added that to his game, he's affecting players around him now, not just with his own performance, but his voice, his physical body language to affect what's around him.
[7310.64 - 7315.64] P:1566.52 E:0.105444 |  Absolute top, top player, tarnished top of his game after an absolute top season.
[7315.64 - 7320.64] P:1705.37 E:0.104389 |  And he is human Van Dyke, tears on the final whistle, he didn't sweat.
[7321.64 - 7336.64] P:1662.90 E:0.110152 |  And of course, just that one moment when it looked like Son had got away from him and you're thinking one more touch, left footed shot and it's going towards the goal and here go the Liverpool players running away to our right as if they're running towards the cop,
[7336.64 - 7349.64] P:1651.08 E:0.103910 |  jumping up in the air because they've actually been celebrating almost in the other half, but now they are running towards their fans behind the goal away to our right, behind the goal and which Dibbik or Royugy just hit that piercing left footed shot with three minutes to go.
[7349.64 - 7355.64] P:1641.58 E:0.098585 |  Which was the one, almost the best quality of the game, the Christmas of that finish, sure.
[7355.64 - 7363.64] P:1447.61 E:0.106542 |  I think you're right, you know, I just had a sudden thought, and some hero tonight for me, in that, you know, an awkward game tonight for different reasons.
[7363.64 - 7369.64] P:1452.02 E:0.107978 |  Jordan Endersson for me, then all the ugly stuff, all the hard work, all the hard yards that it takes to make a real team.
[7369.64 - 7378.64] P:1527.03 E:0.107699 |  He knows he's got quality around him, he knows they've got quality on transition, but he's found a way of being the glue that holds preferences together at times, particularly on this run into this game.
[7378.64 - 7383.64] P:1409.13 E:0.103969 |  You know, I think he's been excellent tonight, but for the things that managers love, not always that fans admire.
[7383.64 - 7394.64] P:1558.77 E:0.100813 |  You'll get this, Rich, Sean, Jurgen Klopp and Dibbik or Royugy having a really good hug, and he's whispering something in his ear, which is probably along the lines of thank you, thank the beep, thank you very much.
[7394.64 - 7400.64] P:1556.35 E:0.107274 |  No more conversations about how many finals I've lost, no more conversations about when is this team going to get over the line, Chris.
[7400.64 - 7406.64] P:1569.95 E:0.101791 |  They have been brilliant Liverpool this season, and they thoroughly deserve something to show for it.
[7406.64 - 7415.64] P:1594.76 E:0.094484 |  But in a funny way, and the fans were telling us last night they wanted the Premier League so badly, almost more than this, but they've got the great European Cup instead for the sixth time.
[7415.64 - 7421.64] P:1641.29 E:0.096344 |  Do you know what the truth is, in my opinion, under Jurgen Klopp, they've been brilliant for four years.
[7421.64 - 7430.64] P:1647.48 E:0.091578 |  They just haven't had the silverware, and people talk about the money which Liverpool have spent, but they've spent it on brilliant players, haven't they?
[7430.64 - 7435.64] P:1650.67 E:0.096392 |  Allyson this season, outstanding, you know, we speak about Van Dijk.
[7435.64 - 7451.64] P:1628.02 E:0.107701 |  I'm just pleased for Klopp, he's galvanised the club, they've been so exciting, exhilarating to watch, and they deserve it, and Sean's right, you know, they've had a different way this season in many respects, of grinding it out and winning ugly and being solid,
[7451.64 - 7456.64] P:1544.80 E:0.104186 |  but they're a great team to watch, and their great fan base deserve this night.
[7456.64 - 7460.64] P:1664.71 E:0.101344 |  And they're going to enjoy this night, long, long, long into the night.
[7460.64 - 7468.64] P:1708.20 E:0.101057 |  606 is on the air when we've had the trophy presentation, and of course Robbie Savage and Steve Crossman will be in charge of that one this evening.
[7468.64 - 7471.64] P:1682.58 E:0.092430 |  Sean, how do you reflect upon how Tottenham played this evening?
[7471.64 - 7473.64] P:1791.59 E:0.099912 |  Which they said they didn't freeze, but they didn't...
[7473.64 - 7480.64] P:1581.38 E:0.106626 |  No, no, it's in the first half, they didn't find the rhythm, they didn't find the Christmas, the passing, the movement.
[7480.64 - 7485.64] P:1617.95 E:0.102399 |  It came as the game went on, and we thought it would, I said, ah, don't be surprised if it doesn't come at some point.
[7485.64 - 7493.64] P:1652.21 E:0.102424 |  They did ask more questions, they did put the Liverpool defence under pressure, but like I said, the 22 goals in the season have conceded Liverpool.
[7493.64 - 7499.64] P:1609.38 E:0.100582 |  You know, they can contain games when they need to, and they did, we know they can find a chance, we know they can find a goal, they did.
[7499.64 - 7508.64] P:1582.52 E:0.103354 |  I mentioned about set pieces, I know it's the second, third-face set piece, but they've been strong with all of the basic details, as well as the beautiful game that they sometimes play.
[7508.64 - 7515.64] P:1618.22 E:0.108185 |  Tottenham didn't quite find the highs they have done, we wonder whether they could find them highs, I don't think they did tonight, but it is difficult.
[7515.64 - 7521.64] P:1548.15 E:0.109789 |  You're playing against one of the top sides in Europe, and now the obvious winners of Europe in the Champions League in Liverpool.
[7521.64 - 7524.64] P:1724.27 E:0.105062 |  I think they've shown great guts and resolve and desire this season.
[7524.64 - 7530.64] P:1714.63 E:0.095063 |  The big question, Spurs fans will be wanting to know now, though, is their manager going to stay?
[7530.64 - 7534.64] P:1479.31 E:0.093498 |  Well, I'm just thinking also, Lukas Morin, floods of tears there.
[7534.64 - 7537.64] P:1424.17 E:0.110385 |  Chris was there, I'm supposed to say the Delhi Alley header wasn't there.
[7537.64 - 7541.64] P:1549.06 E:0.110170 |  I'm trying to think, wasn't one of those where you go, oh, they missed a glaring opportunity there.
[7541.64 - 7548.64] P:1677.39 E:0.101607 |  They didn't really create an absolute cast iron chance that if you were a Tottenham fan, you'd feel you should have taken.
[7548.64 - 7559.64] P:1758.71 E:0.096628 |  Truth is, the first half, they didn't do enough, didn't trouble Allyson, but in fairness, second half they came out, they rejuvenated, they gave it a go, but wasn't anything clear-cut enough.
[7559.64 - 7564.64] P:1786.59 E:0.100886 |  Harry Kane didn't really get any chances. He was the one they had to feed and give him the opportunities.
[7564.64 - 7575.64] P:1792.80 E:0.087822 |  They were all saves you'd expect Allyson to make, but in fairness to Tottenham, they gave it a go second half, but I think the better team won, the more efficient team won.
[7575.64 - 7580.64] P:1715.08 E:0.103286 |  Christian says, is there anyone in world football who likes a big game as much as Dibok Origi?
[7580.64 - 7587.64] P:1678.67 E:0.099316 |  Not at the moment, Christian. Khaled finally, the miserable record of Jürgen Klopp in finals has come to an end, and it's much deserved.
[7587.64 - 7593.64] P:1661.54 E:0.100272 |  And Prasanna, both teams never really showed up, but Liverpool deserve something for the season.
[7593.64 - 7599.64] P:1620.39 E:0.097612 |  Stacey, no shame for Tottenham, what a remarkable year, but the difference was experience on European football's biggest stage.
[7599.64 - 7604.64] P:1616.97 E:0.102018 |  Cody, if you told me at the beginning of the season that Tottenham would have made it to the final, I would have wanted to believe you.
[7604.64 - 7610.64] P:1618.95 E:0.100060 |  Couldn't be more proud and sapide. Tottenham lost the moment Kane was in the line-up, didn't show anything for 90 minutes.
[7610.64 - 7614.64] P:1538.29 E:0.094714 |  Poor waste of more as time. Did Van Dijk have Kane in his pocket, Sean?
[7615.64 - 7622.64] P:1582.27 E:0.115911 |  I think it's unfair, I really do. You're asking a lot of Harry Kane, we mentioned in the build-up, I changed my opinion because he had two weeks full training,
[7622.64 - 7626.64] P:1737.16 E:0.100664 |  because yesterday I said it's very difficult, Chris agree with that.
[7626.64 - 7631.64] P:1681.56 E:0.103128 |  Centre forwards is a different thing, you want to go out there sharp on top of your game, and that's very difficult to find,
[7631.64 - 7635.64] P:1705.67 E:0.101761 |  even with someone as professional and as fit and looks like a hurricane.
[7635.64 - 7639.64] P:1653.23 E:0.098325 |  I think it's a big question to ask of him tonight to go out there and deliver.
[7639.64 - 7646.64] P:1549.52 E:0.105307 |  Still could have happened for him, he's got amazing quality and movement and cleverness, but still a lot to ask against an absolute rollsaw to the centre.
[7646.64 - 7654.64] P:1664.20 E:0.091795 |  Personally, worlds best at this current time, well, certainly to my knowledge, certainly Europe's best in Van Dijk.
[7654.64 - 7661.64] P:1925.44 E:0.102277 |  The stage has been re-erected, not the one that we had before, but a much smaller version on the half-way line towards us, John.
[7661.64 - 7668.64] P:1813.46 E:0.093709 |  This is rather nice now because the presentations are done on the pitch, it allows the winning team to very sportingly form a tunnel
[7668.64 - 7673.64] P:1847.45 E:0.093765 |  through which the losers are going to go. Of course, certainly they've played with England for each other, they know each other so well.
[7673.64 - 7678.64] P:1786.23 E:0.097689 |  There will be a lot of commiserations as there have been already, and a lot of good sportsmanship.
[7678.64 - 7682.64] P:1772.50 E:0.096406 |  But actually it's been a very, the whole build-up hasn't it? Tottenham little bit, but no trouble.
[7682.64 - 7689.64] P:1744.75 E:0.091374 |  Off the pitch, on the pitch, throughout the game, backstabbing, nasty words, manager sniping, it's been played up.
[7689.64 - 7693.64] P:1669.28 E:0.106849 |  No, a real good feeling. Real good feeling, real respectful feeling.
[7693.64 - 7699.64] P:1689.10 E:0.097684 |  All the good things that come out for all, all the right things that come out for all, on the pitch, off the pitch, the build-up, the feel of it.
[7699.64 - 7705.64] P:1604.86 E:0.090735 |  I've been fantastic to be here, you know, I do thank everyone here for inviting me because it's been brilliant to be here, brilliant to be part of it.
[7705.64 - 7712.64] P:1677.30 E:0.101934 |  Well, it's been great to have you, Sean, as well, to watch this all-English final, which Liverpool have won by two goals to nil.
[7712.64 - 7717.64] P:1730.15 E:0.099892 |  And now, I think the players have had enough now, haven't they, John? You can see them, they're all a bit fed up now, they're ready to go.
[7717.64 - 7722.64] P:1564.79 E:0.097905 |  Trophy isn't, and the trophy presentation team have probably been stuck in a lift or something.
[7722.64 - 7733.64] P:1705.11 E:0.105121 |  I was going to say as well, you know, Garrel Southgate, who is here tonight, he will be relieved about what you say, because that was a little bit of a talking point, wasn't it, with all of the England players due to meet up,
[7733.64 - 7738.64] P:1812.38 E:0.092082 |  they're due to meet at St George's Park on Tuesday, the players who are here tonight.
[7738.64 - 7747.64] P:1760.80 E:0.088582 |  And there'll be team-mates, and they'll be up against Van Dijk and Vijn Alden on Thursday night when we're in Gimmerijnj.
[7747.64 - 7758.64] P:1742.93 E:0.098342 |  But as well, talking about Van Dijk, you know, if there was a minute, a moment in that match as well, when it was one-nil, the Van Dijk challenge on Són, when it looked as though Són was in.
[7758.64 - 7763.64] P:1536.96 E:0.105769 |  And if there's a moment when it capsulated things, then that's probably it for Van Dijk.
[7763.64 - 7766.64] P:1480.45 E:0.108653 |  Big players deliver big moments, and he's certainly capable of that.
[7766.64 - 7775.64] P:1628.18 E:0.111860 |  Well, it's Ian Rush, who has been given the honour of stepping forward with the Champions League trophy, which already has its red ribbons on it.
[7775.64 - 7782.64] P:1510.08 E:0.106467 |  It's been a while since Istanbul in 2005, since those ribbons were on that trophy.
[7782.64 - 7790.64] P:1506.68 E:0.101620 |  But back on there again, Liverpool, England's most successful European club,
[7790.64 - 7795.64] P:1623.20 E:0.091080 |  winning the European Cup or the Champions League tonight for the sixth time.
[7795.64 - 7802.64] P:1738.52 E:0.101324 |  It's a ninth European trophy success in all, if you throw in the three times that they've won,
[7802.64 - 7812.64] P:1549.87 E:0.102181 |  what is now the Europa League trophy, and the referee, Damia Skimina, is now coming up to receive his medals with the assistants.
[7812.64 - 7822.64] P:1612.47 E:0.090777 |  I suppose this being the first Champions League final when we've had VAR, do the VAR officials, they not get medals as well?
[7822.64 - 7824.64] P:1640.59 E:0.092957 |  That will come in time, maybe.
[7824.64 - 7826.64] P:1631.48 E:0.092264 |  How many of them are there?
[7826.64 - 7827.64] P:1641.88 E:0.078594 |  Many of them, Chris.
[7827.64 - 7831.64] P:1601.80 E:0.102980 |  There's so many people out there, I'm not sure how many medals they'll be bringing in the old boy, making them.
[7831.64 - 7835.64] P:1825.18 E:0.092870 |  Well, it's the Tottenham players who are now being called forward.
[7835.64 - 7844.64] P:1684.28 E:0.109430 |  I mean, the mammoth effort that they made in reaching this Champions League final, as Mauritio Pochettino did say on a number of occasions,
[7844.64 - 7846.64] P:1707.35 E:0.107443 |  but I think he's absolutely right to do so.
[7846.64 - 7855.64] P:1687.10 E:0.108076 |  This is a club that hasn't signed a new player since January of last year, two transfer windows without Moussa Dembele left in January.
[7855.64 - 7863.64] P:1729.03 E:0.101684 |  They've had the delays to the building of their new stadium, and the fact that they've had to compete with the outstanding Manchester City and Liverpool,
[7863.64 - 7867.64] P:1772.24 E:0.091759 |  and ended up fourth in the Premier League, but reaching the Champions League final.
[7867.64 - 7876.64] P:1680.22 E:0.091447 |  However, there'll still be that great disappointment as the players, Fernando Llorente, I see him receiving his medal now,
[7876.64 - 7881.64] P:1639.10 E:0.095884 |  and Toby Alderviro, the runner-up in the Champions League for the second time.
[7881.64 - 7883.64] P:1660.06 E:0.092690 |  There's no disguising the disappointment.
[7883.64 - 7885.64] P:1862.74 E:0.088805 |  And, you know, let's get it right.
[7885.64 - 7893.64] P:1752.01 E:0.085330 |  This will be a night that the Spurs players, they will never forget this was there, you know, maybe for most of them,
[7893.64 - 7900.64] P:1801.99 E:0.092133 |  I'm pretty sure for most of them, this was their one shot they will get at the Champions League in a Spurs shirt,
[7900.64 - 7905.64] P:1700.26 E:0.077910 |  and they gave it a go, but on the night just came up short.
[7905.64 - 7912.64] P:1768.82 E:0.088660 |  But there's a lot to admire about this Spurs team and the manager on the night, just not good enough.
[7912.64 - 7920.64] P:1665.98 E:0.093837 |  Jan Fautonghen, stern faced, receiving his medal from Alexander Saffir in the President of UEFA,
[7920.64 - 7926.64] P:1716.53 E:0.080451 |  who's just standing to the right of the European Cup, which is on a perspex plinth,
[7926.64 - 7931.64] P:1634.40 E:0.099321 |  Son Heung-min, who was typical Son really in the second half, he did create chances.
[7931.64 - 7936.64] P:1731.35 E:0.105938 |  And now we're going to see Jürgen Klopp step forward first for Liverpool.
[7936.64 - 7942.64] P:1639.15 E:0.110171 |  And now there's Jürgen Klopp, who steps up onto the stage.
[7942.64 - 7946.64] P:1543.87 E:0.115316 |  John W. Henry is there from the Fenway Sports Group, he gives him a hug,
[7946.64 - 7951.64] P:1618.03 E:0.113210 |  and Jürgen Klopp just walks past the Champions League trophy,
[7951.64 - 7956.64] P:1656.50 E:0.104241 |  and now there's a fist bump from Klopp, who's the first man onto the blue stage,
[7956.64 - 7961.64] P:1661.03 E:0.099998 |  where they gather in front of the arch before the European Cup will be presented.
[7961.64 - 7967.64] P:1536.07 E:0.101885 |  So he has joined the ranks of the Liverpool managers, Jürgen Klopp,
[7967.64 - 7973.64] P:1557.39 E:0.094507 |  who have led the team to become European Cup or Champions League winners.
[7973.64 - 7975.64] P:1565.07 E:0.094435 |  But Paisley did it three times.
[7975.64 - 7980.64] P:1709.08 E:0.087632 |  Joe Fagan, Rafa Benitez the most recent, until today,
[7980.64 - 7990.64] P:1777.49 E:0.089006 |  when Jürgen Klopp, who is now guaranteed to have his face on Liverpool banners forever more inside Anfield and in the Cop.
[7990.64 - 7995.64] P:1781.52 E:0.095733 |  And the Liverpool players one by one continue to come through Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain,
[7995.64 - 8002.64] P:1663.62 E:0.086127 |  who recovered from injury in time to take a place on the bench, having missed the Champions League last season.
[8002.64 - 8008.64] P:1688.53 E:0.093390 |  Divock Oregi has received his medal as well, the man who scored the clinching goal.
[8008.64 - 8011.64] P:1499.30 E:0.046974 |  Still they come.
[8011.64 - 8017.64] P:1719.90 E:0.090278 |  Allyson just walking past the trophy, now he did make a series of saves during the course of the second half.
[8017.64 - 8024.64] P:1537.62 E:0.079854 |  And only three more Liverpool players before Jordan Henderson waits at the end of the line.
[8024.64 - 8031.64] P:1622.35 E:0.083282 |  Jordan Henderson, who will become the latest Liverpool captain, to lift that trophy
[8031.64 - 8038.64] P:1701.38 E:0.098417 |  and join Emeline Hughes and Phil Thompson and Graeme Sunnis and Stephen Gerrard.
[8038.64 - 8041.64] P:1658.07 E:0.094161 |  Alexander Saffrin reaches for the European Cup.
[8041.64 - 8048.64] P:1625.69 E:0.105406 |  The Champions League trophy is given to Jordan Henderson and he steps onto the podium
[8048.64 - 8058.64] P:1667.54 E:0.108460 |  and Liverpool are acclaimed in Madrid as the six times European champions.
[8058.64 - 8065.64] P:1713.15 E:0.109818 |  But for the first time it is silverware under the management of Jürgen Klopp.
[8065.64 - 8071.64] P:1696.54 E:0.117041 |  And you must say seeing them celebrate here on the stage as the ticket take comes down,
[8071.64 - 8078.64] P:1733.39 E:0.098712 |  it does feel like this is just the beginning for Klopp and Liverpool.
[8078.64 - 8083.64] P:1781.27 E:0.103383 |  And as he himself might say, boom!
[8086.64 - 8091.64] P:1696.95 E:0.127264 |  Oh John, I thought you were going to say scenes. No, we can't have scenes twice.
[8091.64 - 8094.64] P:1712.58 E:0.112098 |  Terrific stuff John, thank you very much indeed.
[8094.64 - 8096.64] P:1782.19 E:0.093229 |  There you go, the fireworks.
[8096.64 - 8103.64] P:1740.47 E:0.096640 |  And of course the other side of the coin, the Tottenham players who have been to see their fans away to the left
[8103.64 - 8108.64] P:1740.70 E:0.102321 |  now trudge and that is the only verb that would accurately describe the nature of their walk.
[8108.64 - 8114.64] P:1433.53 E:0.101196 |  Trudge back towards us. Some of them actually stop to watch the Liverpool players celebrating
[8114.64 - 8118.64] P:1365.57 E:0.112327 |  before they'll disappear and you'll never walk alone, gets going again.
[8118.64 - 8122.64] P:1472.10 E:0.114087 |  Right, 6-0-6 is on the way with Robbie Savage and Steve Crossman.
[8122.64 - 8125.64] P:1398.28 E:0.113646 |  And final word then, that is the end of the domestic season.
[8125.64 - 8129.64] P:1373.93 E:0.113647 |  We've still got England on five live of course in the Nations League this week.
[8129.64 - 8135.64] P:1543.04 E:0.098762 |  It's time for everybody in British domestic football to breathe and rest up and walk the dog
[8135.64 - 8137.64] P:1684.55 E:0.096318 |  and watch cricket and talk about other things.
[8137.64 - 8139.64] P:1432.38 E:0.098271 |  Do you know what the amazing thing is?
[8139.64 - 8143.64] P:1398.39 E:0.096800 |  I think Jürgen Klopp will obviously enjoy the next few days I'm sure.
[8143.64 - 8146.64] P:1404.80 E:0.100648 |  That might even have just a half a lager or two.
[8146.64 - 8151.64] P:1353.81 E:0.112353 |  But I think of that before you know it, his brain will be wearing, he'll be speaking to his staff
[8151.64 - 8155.64] P:1328.56 E:0.106432 |  and you just continually looking to move forward and I think he will do that.
[8155.64 - 8162.64] P:1615.90 E:0.104534 |  But I am absolutely sure him, his staff, the Liverpool players, everyone involved with Liverpool,
[8162.64 - 8166.64] P:1652.11 E:0.091778 |  distant or here will absolutely enjoy this and absolutely deserved
[8166.64 - 8171.64] P:1136.72 E:0.102560 |  because fantastic season from him, from his staff, from the players, the fans.
[8171.64 - 8174.64] P:1170.52 E:0.105458 |  Everything about football from Liverpool this season has been right.
[8174.64 - 8179.64] P:1344.72 E:0.100539 |  They've ended up with this magnificent night, magnificent stade to take on the Champions League,
[8179.64 - 8181.64] P:1435.46 E:0.096945 |  take home the Champions League this year.
[8181.64 - 8187.64] P:1654.70 E:0.112782 |  Sean, we'll have half a lager ourselves to round off the evening and a busy day
[8187.64 - 8192.64] P:1640.83 E:0.113137 |  and to have enjoyed your company very much indeed and we will leave you at home wherever you are.
[8192.64 - 8197.64] P:1662.63 E:0.102105 |  Tottenham or Liverpool, I'm sure some Tottenham fans because they've had such an astonishing run
[8197.64 - 8201.64] P:1568.18 E:0.105885 |  to the Champions League final with the Liverpool fans of course in particular.
[8201.64 - 8206.64] P:1597.08 E:0.058326 |  We're going to get in touch with 606 now with Robbie Savage and with Steve Crossman.
