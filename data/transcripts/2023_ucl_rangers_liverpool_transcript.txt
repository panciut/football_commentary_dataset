 Cholak up front rather than Marelos as it was at Anfield. And for Liverpool, Alisson in goal, a back four of Gomez in for the injured Alexander-Arnold. Canate, his first start of the season, Van Dijk and Simikas, Fabinho and Henderson, Elliot Carvalho, Firmino and Nunes. There's the whistle from Slavko Vincic. Rangers, Liverpool gets underway and immediately Liverpool fire the ball forward towards the edge of the Rangers penalty area and it's whacked away out of play for a throwing for Liverpool out on the left-hand side and Liverpool immediately knocking the ball back towards the edge of the penalty area where Van Dijk turns, Cholak will come to close him down, Cholak, 13-goal top scorer for Rangers this season with six goals in his last four appearances. Fabinho passing the ball back to the edge of the box, Van Dijk is there to see it to Alisson who passes it just in front of Cholak, back to Van Dijk and then forward it goes towards Carvalho, deep inside his own half, Liverpool moving forward quickly, all in red with a white trim, white numbers crossing the halfway line and back it goes to Van Dijk again, goes long this time with his left foot. That's one for Nunes to chase, Nunes reaches it on the edge of the penalty area, Davis went across there with him and it's hooked away and cleared away. To Henderson, Senderfield going, Henderson flicks it, past Arfield, Henderson now to the right-hand side to Gomez, Elliott has come out to the right as well. Gio van Bronco is trying to gip his team on the edge of the coaching area there, Liverpool have seen lots of possession in the early stages, Elliott now, Harvey Elliott the teenager back to Jordan Henderson and Liverpool go back into their own half, again Van Dijk and Canate, Rangers can't get the ball in the opening stages, this is not promising for them, Liverpool are doing their best here to kill this vibrant atmosphere inside Ibrox and finally Barisic has a touch and he's able to go back to McGregor who will hit it long to the halfway line but a clear pattern already emerging Jonathan Woodgate. Yeah you can see it, with Carvalho just coming off the left-hand side, he's playing more like an inside forward and so has Harvey Elliott being really tight inside the pitch. Well that was a real cruncher from Canate on Ryan Jack on the halfway line and I ten yards in from the coaching areas here, he got ball but he certainly got man as well. It's a good tackle Jonny, in my view, let him know he was there as a lot of centre-backs used to do, not so much now but just going back onto Liverpool then, why they dominated the ball early there because they had a lot of options in the centre of the pitch with Elliott tucking in off the right-hand side, Carvalho coming off the left and then you've got Firmino, they're really stuck in the area up and the beauty of this in the sea, a range is caught with the movement of Elliott and Carvalho. Jack's okay, he's back up on his feet, that was a real juddero wasn't it, the challenge from Canate here as I say is starting for the first time this season. It was a lovely tackle Jonny. It was, it was, yeah and he enjoyed it, you could tell the way Canate got to his feet. Saw the line. Yes, I can tell that as well. And, range has, have a throw, half-way inside, deliver through half. All they are saying is give us a goal in the Champions League and if they do get one for the first time in this group stage you will know about it via your radio as McGregor has the ball at the back, one of the stars, the real star really for Rangers last week, kept the score down. There's a ball over the top for Kent, the former Liverpool youngster. Ryan Kent is onto it in the full back position. Kent then rolls it back, Barasic is behind him, takes a touch, knocks it in field, Lundström is there, the Liverpool fan is a boy, he was talking about it to us yesterday, Jon Lundström and then back it goes to Davis on the half-way line, another former Liverpool player. Lundström goes cross-field out to the right-hand side, Sakala is there, left foot shot but it's weak and Allyson is able to drop onto it quite comfortably but there we have it, Rangers first attempt on goal in the fourth minute this week as opposed to I think it was the 84th last week. It was a lovely cross-field pass, just got in behind Simicast, the weak shot in the end but at least they're starting to get on the front foot. It was Sakala with the shot, fashion Sakala who's come into the team tonight compared to last week but he did start on Saturday and scored the late fourth goal against St. Mirren. Rangers coming for it again, here's Kent once more on the left wing, Kent running at Gomez, into the penalty area now onto his right foot, goes for a curler but wide and high by about a yard. It was a good strike, it was positive but you can see they're trying to get down the sides of Liverpool with Gomez and Simicast on the left-hand side. They'll see that as a weakness in the Liverpool team with the two main full-backs out. Rangers 0, Liverpool 0, this is five-lives from the BBC, BBC sounds as well, radio-mergy side-listner is with us again tonight so great to have you with us as Liverpool break forward but good work from Rangers, Davis is able to tidy that up and go back to Golgi, back to McGregor to a raucous round of applause. The rhythm continues to beat out from the stand to our left, floodlights brightly on at Iverock's and here's Carvalho turning, carrying it forward down the left-hand side, Simicast is there in support, the Greek, Andy Robertson is on the substitute bench for Liverpool tonight if you didn't hear Sarah that earlier, back to the half-way line to Van Dijk, Van Dijk, forward through the middle to Harvey Elliott who turns away from Arfield, left-footed ball to Simicast on the left-hand side, Simicast now goes for the early cross towards Nourniers but it's over the top again, a little hop after the ball but he knew he wasn't going to be able to get there and it's out for a throw at the Rangers. Tavirni is going to have a real problem, a real problem when Carvalho comes inside and he's got Simicast on the wide outside of him, he's got a real problem and if they don't sort that out now, Carvalho's start dominating it. 0-0, Rangers clearing from the left-back position, but Fabinho's got up there to head it forward and OTI are going the team tonight by that, he's on the substitute, Manchester City on Sunday at Anfield, that's a five-life commentary match incidentally and then Jack slides into the challenge, he got the ball but Nourniers was standing behind the ball and there was contact but he went down rather theatrically and referee Vintcourt just waved play on. Rangers Nill, Liverpool Nill, we're also with Tottenham tonight, the Germans, Eintracht Frankfurt, the team that beat Rangers in the Europa League final last season, other visitors there tonight and Anders de Bruis-Balls watching from on high I guess. Yeah, cracking atmosphere in here too John, five minutes gone, 0-0, Frankfurt putting the pressure on early on, Tottenham guilty of giving the ball away, causing themselves a few problems, you mentioned that Europa League success last season, they were excellent away from home in particular, they started well tonight Frankfurt, Tottenham 0-0. Well if you remember Rangers were excellent at home last season, unbeaten on the knockout stages here at Ibrox in that run to the final in Seville, Rangers playing the ball down the left but Arfield couldn't keep it in and it's out of play for Liverpool throw. I can tell you in the Champions League as well it's Bayer Levy-Kussen, Nill Porto 1 with Shabia Lonzo now in charge of Bayer Levy-Kussen, had a great win at the weekend in the Bundesliga but 1-0 down at home to Porto in that group, already in that group, Atletico Madrid, Nill, club Bruise, Nill tonight, so that's the first match, the club Bruise have failed to win the group leaders and Atletico Madrid now with four points in the group, seven minutes played, Rangers Nill, Liverpool Nill, Bristol City Nill, Preston Nill as well in the one match that's been played in the Championship this evening as Ben Davis goes all the way back to the man in yellow, McGregor who clears rather waywardly, actually it's controlled by Giovanni van Vromkos, the Rangers manager down there on the edge of the coaching area, Champions League winner remember, van Vromkos lead and is playing days with Barcelona, throwing taken in field by Liverpool, Fabinho is lifting it back into his own half, Joe Gomez now heads it back for Canate and Canate goes back to goalkeeper Alisson. So Carlos gonna have to do some work defensively to follow Simicas constantly in this game because Taverny is starting to go all the way for Cavaleo now. Here's Fabinho just heading forward from inside his own half, Cavaleo goes down but the referee says play on. Fabinho takes it to the halfway line and then in comes the challenge, good one from Conor Colson and advances out for a throw in to Liverpool. So lots of Liverpool possession early on but it's Rangers who've had the couple of meaningful efforts at goal, that shot from Sicala that was comfortably saved and then the effort over the angle of post with Barth from Kent, upside flag up against Liverpool and the ball's kicked away by Carvalho and referee Vintcourt comes across and just wags the finger at young Carvalho. And this players pass that job. Yeah so it's a free kick to Rangers inside their own half. The youth in him. Yeah Rangers take this free kick goal over the top of Sicala, Simicas is headed away, now Lundstranz on to this, Liverpool's shouting for handball, it's not given. In comes the cross, Trollac was lurking but it was headed away by Canate who got there first and then it's cleared. Up towards Darwin Nunes on the halfway line, Goldson together and Nunes then kicking out of the ball has actually kicked Goldson who's gone down and it's a free kick that Liverpool are disputing. Nunes has to do better there to bread and butter ball, he has to hold onto that ball, make it stick, make it difficult for the defender but he ends up giving it free kick away, frustrating because it's an easy ball to take in. Incidentally with the referee Vintcourt today last week at Anfield they appointed the referee that took charge of Liverpool in the Champions League final last season, Clenon Turpan. This week it's the referee who took charge of Rangers in the Europa League final last season in Seville. Back it goes to McGregor with the ball in front of his penalty area. Nilnil if you've just joined us here at an atmospheric I-Brocks, long downfield from McGregor but Allison is able to come to the edge of his penalty area, actually took a couple of steps outside before dancing back in and caught the bouncing ball. Elliott back to Canate and that's a tour pass from Canate giving away the 10 and then putting the challenge on Trollhack, it's not giving us a free kick but Rangers are able to tidy up Cavaniere going across and passes it back to McGregor. That is strong, strong again that's two tackles now. He looks like a man who's come into the team quite possibly because of Matt's injury but he looks like a man who's set on keeping his place. Well he's got a chance to stay in the team hasn't he with the situation of Matt at the minute but he's doing well. It's going to be a couple of weeks or so for Matt before he's fit. Same for Alexander-Arnold by the way if you didn't hear that news yesterday and Sadio Mane has scored for Bayern Munich tonight, Victoria Plitzen-Nil Bayern Munich won Bayern already nine points out of nine in that group where it's Barcelona-Nil into Nil. Henderson, bouncing ball inside his own half then it's headed forward by Lundstra. Ryan Kent tries to turn it to Trollhack but Gomez got there first and he hands off Trollhack with his upper arm really. Trollhack goes down no free kick he's let that go as well the referee you like in that I can tell Liverpool go forward through the middle to Nunez. Nunez then challenged good challenge as well went back by Goldsson but the pass forward is over hit by Lundstra and then Arlesons got it. Trollhack's been it three times now once by Gomez once by Kanat it he doesn't like it he doesn't like it. He's done tremendously well after signing in the summer Antonio Trollhack 13 goals he's got that crucial goal in Eindhoven against PSV that won the tie and got Rangers back into the group stages of the Champions League for the first time for 12 years. Rangers, Liverpool in possession now Liverpool six times winners of this competition Kanate to Elliott and Elliott does well and takes it on through the middle and chips the ball to Nunez and Nunez plays it across but Cavaniere was able to move over and volley it behind and actually the offside flag was up against Nunez. Harvey Elliott looks so excited there when he got on the ball and drove at the Rangers defend a cute little pass. It was a knee offside John, a knee offside but Howard's excited when he came in off the line you can just see Liverpool overloading that central area it's like a 4v3 in the central area of the pitch and yet Harvey Elliott there found space. He found space he's got that in there he's got that in his locker-lashing when he drives it clears and that's when he's at his best. What do we think for the Liverpool system then 4-4-2 I mean Anderson Fabinho together in the middle there. Out of possession the press 4-4-2 in possession the 4-2-2-1 sorry 4-2-2-2 yes get your fingers sorted though with Elliott on the right hand side Calvario on the left hand side and then up front Firmino towards the left and Nunez towards the right off that front two when it is a front two. Rangers 0 Liverpool 0 is the score here on 5 live and Ibrox and Rangers in possession inside their own half but certainly tonight I'm relieved to say pleased to say this is much more of a contest as Rangers hit the ball downfield Goldsons over hit that and it's out of play for a throw to Liverpool deep inside their own half. So back four for Van Fronkost tonight. By and Munich now 2-0 up at Victoria Plitsen. Thomas Mullack has scored the second after Sadio Mane scored the first. So no no Leon King in the starting line-up tonight the 18 year old he's on the bench Stephen Davis on the bench as well tonight the disappointing Kilman from the first match and James Sands as well back from suspension couldn't play at Anfield he's among the substitutes. No Glenn Kamara incidentally who has got a little injury so he is not involved. Barasic long ball over the top towards the edge of the area. Now down on his chest Gomez is very very tight on him. Elliott helps him out and Liverpool have got the ball back and Gomez wins the throw in in that right back area. That can be strong there Gomez. Will Neujer from the Liverpool days, Kent had a few loans. Ryan Kent Bristol City is one of them. I think there's a great sign under Stephen Gerrard. We've got a real good team together Gerrard at the time Van Fronkost took over. Yeah when he's on he's a real talent isn't he Ryan Kent. Oh and it goes from Gomez but that's walloped away back downfield from Ben Davis who never actually got on to the field for the Liverpool first team in the brief time that he was there Ben Davis. He has lunced run now at the back lunced run to heavy first touch but he's able to get into the challenge and pass it back to the back line. Goldson now out to the right hand side and that has been an opening goal in the top of Eintracht Frankfurt game. Alistair Bruce Ball. It's gone to the visitors Tottenham have made a right and messed the things at the back. Poor touch from Eric Dyer on the edge of his own box. Frankfurt won at Hugo Larisse, dived in to try and help things out, palmed the ball into the middle of his penalty area and Sebastian Röder passed it to Camada and Camada stroked it home. Tottenham Niel, Frankfurt won. Well still sporting Niel Marseille, Niel sporting top of that group and Tottenham and Frankfurt both with four points coming in tonight so Frankfurt winning one Niel at Tottenham. Niel Niel here while we're listening to Ali Reigns just had a little bit of pressure around the Liverpool box but it came to nothing Jonathan. Yeah I'm just down. It's a lackluster cross into the box really. You can see how Reigns are trying to build up possession if Liverpool don't press them. They're being patient with the ball but then Liverpool get the shape and the Reigns as a town can find it difficult to play through this Liverpool team. Especially through the middle they're trying to go wide at a dover. Yeah Reigns is with the ball at the back. Davis goes for that high ball again looking for it out towards the far side. Cicala up against Simicast but that's a good leap by Simicast to win the header however Reigns is having back here. So Arfield through the middle, Arfield scores! Rages are in front and Glory B, Rages have a goal in the Champions League group stage again. What a noise inside Ibrox as the 33 year old Scott Arfield buried it into the bottom corner and it's Rages won Liverpool 0. What a run by Arfield at the box he wasn't matched by Favigno. It was a long diagonal pass to pick up the second Cavalio lost it but he just runs off the bat. I think it was Henderson in the end but what a finish. What a finish. Gomez couldn't come round the cover, 1-0 Ranges. There is a goal check going on. Whoa that would burst the bubble wouldn't it? So a goal check is taking place. I think they've spotted it behind us. I can hear the Ranges regulars behind us but the game restarts and the goal check. The goal is approved and Scott Arfield coming into the team tonight. He has actually now Arfield started five of the last six matches but didn't play, didn't start the match at Anfield and what a finish. What a pinpoint finish it was from him. Brilliant finish and you look at him now in the midfield area, pausing down the Liverpool team but it took it so well. It was the timing of the running of the box off the back of I think it was Favigno and Gomez couldn't get round it quickly enough to track him but great finish. I can hardly hear you, Jonathan. In this vibrant atmosphere inside Ibrox where Liverpool are behind and Ranges have finally got a goal again in the group stages of the Champions League for the first time for 12 years. The last one was scored in northwest Turkey by Kenny Miller against Berzer Spore and tonight it's Scott Arfield who becomes the first man to score for Rangers in a competitive match against Liverpool as well. There's history all over that. Elliott heading it forward but Davis brings it down and now this crowd, this 50,000 crowd, Giovanni Broncos, all of the Rangers follow us everywhere. They've got what they wanted in this game, they've got their noses in front. Makes it twice as hard when you get the crowd up, especially this crowd. The atmosphere, the vibrant, the one more. Liverpool have only themselves a blame by not tracking Arfield into the box. Arfield found the space on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area just I think outside the box when he hit the shot from a slight angle and didn't he bury it into that bottom left hand corner. So Rangers won Liverpool 0 and that means that Liverpool for the eighth time this season in 13 competitive matches have gone behind. It's unheard of Liverpool under a Jurgen Klopp team. It really is. That's that way you've just said there is something wrong. There is it's the intensity. They look like the can't move as well as they did last season which is strange. It's there for Liverpool team. Rangers coming forward looking for a second. Having got a first, Arfield can't control it inside the penalty area and Van Dijk is able to hook it away. So Scott Arfield it is. Who is the goal hero so far and Liverpool defending now with Gomez who plays it back into the back of Cholak who touched it past Alison but there was no one else there in a blue shirt and he actually really just shuffled it across the penalty area and Alison was able to pick it up. Just a lack of concentration by Gomez. A lack of concentration. He doesn't even look once to his right hand side to see where the striker is to see if he can pass it back to Alison. Just a lack of concentration. Well we've got a contest now Jonathan. Yeah, really nice. Ball has played up to Nunes. Suggestions that you might have used an arm there but referee Vintcourt allows it to continue and here's Elliott now. Elliott receiving it 10 yards inside the Rangers half playing it to the right hand side. Nunes has balled across his block by Barasic and it's straight to Tottenham and Alistair Bruce Borgh again. Rapier thrust from Tottenham. They were only behind for six minutes. 1-1. You know who, Pastor, you know who. Kane De Son. Son buried it. Tottenham won. Frankfurt won. Rangers won. Liverpool nail in our five-life commentary match tonight in the Champions League as Liverpool win possession back in the central third. Fabinho. Nice change of feet there. That was classy from Fabinho. Just took it away. He used a little bit of pace as well. He has Henderson now. Henderson up towards the edge of the box. To Firmino. Liverpool's top scorer this season. Roberto Firmino with his six goals. Now for Fabinho, clicks it forward. Cavalio on the edge of the box. A low shot from him but as the challenge came in on him from Goulton, he hit it wide by one. A yard and a half. He glides past players though. Cavalio. He looks a real talent. Great buy from Fulham. You can see he's been courtsweller. Look at that football. He put the shot was just a couple of yards. Wider the post. That's better from Liverpool. Well, it was a let down. Frankly, the match last week in terms of being a contest. But this really is a grand occasion as Gomez takes the ball down and plays it back to Allyson. His careless pass almost letting Cholak in Rangers last attack. Ball bounces through the middle third. Nunez, a fortunate bounce off Davis. But a good recovery from Ben Davis to put in the challenge. But Liverpool win it back and Cavalio's onto this again and Cavalio Schutzen is deflected. But McGregor scrambling to his left. Tried to claw it away and lost it and it bounced behind through a corner to Liverpool. I think it was a spin on the ball. What a tackle by Ben Davies there when Nunez was going through. Well timed. Needs to be well-tuned. You're going to do last-ditch tackles. Yeah, the spin just seemed to take it away from McGregor as he was grabbing at it. Near the dead ball line. So it's a Liverpool corner. The Copeland road end to our right two levels of it. Pack with faces watching down as Simicast has a dummy run up. Up a little slope there towards the corner and stopped, thought about it again. So here's the second go-in to the near post and it's headed in by Firmino. So easy. He found space. Roberto Firmino inside the six yard box at the near post and just buried it in to make it rain just one Liverpool one. Brilliant header. That's Firmino. When his team needs him, he stands up, he delivers the ball in from Simicast, whipped into the near post. No one was marking Firmino but just used a bit of strength, guided it into the front area. Brilliant header. Yeah, did really well. Just held off the challenge from Tavernier. It was who was closest to him but flashed past McGregor into the back of the net and the Rangers lead lasted for seven minutes. So they've enjoyed those seven minutes but so quick, so simple. First corner of the match that Liverpool have had. They scored from a free kick and a penalty last week at Anfield and now they get a goal from another set piece this time a corner. The vital in the game. They're absolutely vital. Set plays, thrones, whatever you want. Liverpool are good at them and you need to be better than when you play against them. So it's 1-1 now. Rangers 1, Liverpool 1. Same score as at Tottenham where it's 1-1 between Spurs and Eintracht Frankfurt. Here's Alisson, the thickly deaded Liverpool goalie back. Passes the ball out to Van Dijk. Now Simicast on the left hand side. Simicast receives the ball back but Zicala put in the challenge and won it back from him. Here is the Rangers goal scorer, Arfield and now centrally Lundstrand loses out to Firmino and Firmino now away from the halfway line. Rangers do have men back but the pass to the left through Canuniers. The challenge came in on him from Goldsson and Rangers were able to get it away. Nunez has stayed down there inside the box. Looked a great tackle from Goldsson. Looked a really, really well timed tackle. The pass from Firmino was a little bit sloppy, it was a little bit lackluster but to make up for it there he's got the ball, the follow through might have just caught Nunes. I think he'll be, oh Nunes has caught him on the top of the sort of point where the bottom of his shin reaches the top of his foot. And that was just the follow through. Yeah and I think there was a little slip in there as well wasn't there from him when the challenge was put in. So DAR obviously will have a look at that but I think it'll be okay. Yeah the referee's just walking away from it now and Nunez is back on his feet. So Rangers won, Liverpool won. Pine Munich now running away with the tonight's group match against Victoria Plitz and they're now lead by three goals to nail. Goretz has got the latest one so that's Mane, Mullat and Goretzka and Marseille are winning one nail at Sporting in the Topland Frankfurt group. So that could be very tight if the score stays they are in that group and Sporting at about 10 men, Ricardo Esgayo has been sent off and from the result and penalty Matteo Genduzzi put Marseille in front and Tottenham's last match in that group is a way to Marseille. Marseille against Tottenham. I feel has got Chris Waddle's name written all over it don't you? You'll hear Chris by the way Saturday afternoon with Ian Dennis for the Wolves Nottingham Forest commentary at three o'clock. They've got Wolves Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Everton on Saturday and among our Sunday Premier League commentaries are Lee Darsnell and Five Live will be the place to also listen to Liverpool and Manchester City. So Rangers won, Liverpool won here in the Champions League tonight after Rangers scored first. Throyan is taken into the Rangers box. Nunez plays it back out of the penalty area, Henderson's attempted pass forward was cut out but Liverpool have won it back and here's Van Dijk's runs from the home supporters but Van Dijk's pass forward is also intercepted, fortunate that it comes back to it. Henderson now on the left hand side showing a little bit of pace there. The veteran as he almost is now, Simicast then back to the halfway line to virtual Van Dijk again and Liverpool have it inside their own heart. When you watch Firmino play constantly once the ball no matter what situations he's in, if he's got someone really close to him. All over the top this is for Caldwellio to chase but McGregor is out quickly in his identity to clutch the ball with both gloves in front of his chest as he came out and Caldwellio was running through to one-one the score. There is a penalty at Tottenham, Alastair Bruce Ball. Penalty four Tottenham, Tottenham won Frankfurt one, Harry Kane will take it, Harry Kane was fouled not initially given by the referee, picked up by the VAR, he was barged over by Christian Jakic, the referee was sent to the monitor, had three or four looks at it, has come back out under the pitch, changed his mind and Harry Kane now has a chance to put Tottenham in front. He's up against Kevin Trapp all in green, away to my left hand side, he's holding his arms out wide, Kane's not bothered, he's looking at the ball, three or four steps away from it and waiting for the whistle. Tottenham are one behind tonight, they're two one in front, Kane sticks it away, he scores another penalty, Tottenham two Frankfurt one. Thank you Harry. Rangers one, Liverpool one, the score here at Ibrox, almost half an hour playing and here is Firmino, the man who scored his seventh goal of the season tonight, excellent start of the season, in fact his best start to a season in a gold scoring sense, ball played across Fabinho, bounces back to Caldwellio on the edge of the box, rolls his foot over it, gives it to Timacas, Timacas with the cross, that's headed away by Davis on the edge of his six yard box, chested on the corner of the area by Firmino who's looking to get it back, stretches, tries to lift it across but the ball was already out, you just heard it there, clatter into the metal toast behind the goal, he's gulking. There's great feedback of Allio, just the little roll of the sole, brilliant, little twist of the hips, exciting play for Liverpool for the future, without question. Certainly is Fabio Calvalio, the Portuguese came through with Ben Fica but then the family moved to London and then obviously hit the big time with Fulham and then Liverpool brought him to Anfield for a fee that could be up to something like £7-8 million, something like that. Absolute bargain. But you say they rolled his sole, it actually warmed the sole, didn't it, a little twitch like that. Here's McGregor who clears to the halfway line, Gomez got underneath that, just heads out of play and is to throwing the Rangers halfway inside their own half, we're on air till half past 10 tonight with five live sport, Kelly Cates is here with us at Ibrox tonight and Colin Murray taking over at 10.30 but before that we'll try and bring you some reaction when the managers and the players speak down in the little press room. Did you go in there before the game, very old fashioned press room here downstairs where the ceiling, actually it's a little bit like Alice in Wonderland, the ceiling sort of gets lower as you walk towards the back of the room. My head started scraping on the ceiling. I wonder what that red mark was John. Liverpool take the throw down field and Goldson's able to play it back to McGregor. So Goldson just finds Farnino in front of him so hits the pass, long downfield that that's beyond Sikala and advances through for throwing the Liverpool halfway inside their own half. So one won the score, Scott R Field, super finish, great Champions League moment that wasn't it, when they score that goal, the celebrations, as you ran away, you remember he did one score for Burnley at Anfield against Liverpool, Scott R Field, 34 next month. Yeah it was a beautiful finish. Alison did them a chance of serving it right across the ground, took it in his stride as well, the finish. Both played forward from Davis for Rangers headed away by Van Dijk on the edge of the box and then Fabinho puts in the challenge but Rangers are able to head possession again and Pona Goldson passes it all the way back to go keep McGregor to our right. If we can with all the half an hour played, well once we get an opportunity we're bringing Roddy Forsythe for a word when we can but Rangers in possession inside their own half and the ball is played to the left hand side to Barasic. Barasic looked as though he was going to hit that down field but you know he's gone in field and you can hear the reaction from the supporters behind us. They want their team to be brave tonight and be on the front foot. They feel there, I think that Barasic took the wrong option having been pegged back to 1-1. Goldson does hit a longish pass towards Sacala who flicked it on. Now here's Ryan Jack on the right hand side. Chalak wants it. Jack goes for the early ball right across the edge of the penalty area but Gomez was there and sweeps it behind the far post and Rangers have got their first corner Jonathan. Well as soon as they played forward a bit quicker I'm going to Sacala then they'll cause problems in the good corner from it. Sometimes they're a bit negative in going back and going back they could go forward a lot quicker. In Tottenham's group Marseille now double their lead. Marseille winning 2-0 against 10 man sporting who came into tonight top of the table in that group. Rangers with a corner then from the left hand side so it could be Barasic with the out swinging in fact Kent takes it short and then Barasic swings it across headed away by Canate and he comes out to Carvalho on the edge of the box who controlled it. Cavani had all for Rangers he plays it over the top. Lundstrand on the right hand side drives into the box Lundstrand pulls it across and Liverpool are able to clear through Henderson. Comes out to Barasic again though Barasic to Kent. Kent on the balls of his feet gives it back to Barasic. Whipped cross from Barasic. Chalak got his head to it but that touch took the ball outside of the penalty area. Sacala though takes it up again for Rangers. Sacala against two Liverpool men Fabinho and Nunes is back there as well and Nunes put in the challenge and Sacala lost possession and Liverpool should be able to play it away which they do towards the halfway line but Ball's still in play and Rangers will look to come again 10 minutes to go to halftime and Davis will just roll it here to the left hand side the Barasic who just checks back again and you can hear there is that you can hear the reaction that there is that unsettled reaction as Rangers have just eased the break on again inside their own heart. Golten is going to hit that long pass and he does find Kent and those yellow boots control the ball and now Jack with the drive and run into the full back position but the ball bounces through as Canate puts in the challenge and it's a gold kick for Liverpool so let's bring in Ruddy. Ruddy Forsythe for a view on the game. I think we can agree Rangers have regained a degree of respectability in this game but what worries me from their point of view is the fact that they've conceded a goal from a corner kick when they played PSV here in the playoff for the group stage they were twice ahead and twice conceded from corner kicks at that point John McLaughlin was getting the blame for not commanding his defense but tonight it's the 40 year old McGregor who's in charge of the penalty area. Thank you Ruddy. Bristol City nail Preston Nail is the halftime scorer at Ashton Gate and Bayern Munich and now four-nail up Leon Goretzka scored his second of the match so Victoria puts a nil Bayern Munich four so Bayern Munich will make it 12 points out of 12 tonight. Here is Davis who does well and the pressure plays the ball back to McGregor so Rangers tonight at least have got off the mark in terms of goals in this group so they will not become the second team to fail to win a point or score a goal in a Champions League group this season it was Maccabi Haifan who have that dubious privilege Rangers coming forward when a free kick over on the right hand side, Sacala was being wrestled by Simicast. Canton, Sacala can definitely get a Gomez and Simicast there's a weakness there and they're on the way if they just play forward a little bit more quicker Rangers and getting behind is a big advantage in that area. Here's the free kick then four Rangers and it comes towards the penalty spot it's headed away it comes out Davis on the edge of the box four Rangers back to Jack and then rather belatedly the the offside flag goes up in there and it's a free kick to Liverpool on the edge of their own box by a Liverpool equalised against Porto so that is 1-1 and Liverpool have this free kick on the edge of their own penalty area so around about eight minutes to go plus added time to the break it's been enjoyable and it is all square and the referee says he wants Liverpool to take that free kick again and there is a potential penalty check taking place the check is over that was quick still it was dramatic while it lasted as Canate is felled by Cholak 15 yards inside his own heart that by a labour Cousin goal has been disallowed the air all over the place so that is still labour Cousin 0 Porto 1 5 live radio Merseyside and BBC sounds as Liverpool attack down the left hand side and the ball bounces out of play off Cavalio through throw that Tabbania takes quickly towards the collar on the halfway line Cavalio is quickly backing on that and now Liverpool will play through Fabinho all the way back to Alisson who passes at the knee check the out to Van Dyke and another goal at Tottenham Alistair 10 minutes to half time Tottenham have a third as the great Jimmy on field used to say son of score with what I like to call a thumping volley wonderful strike with his left foot Tottenham 3 Frankfurt 1 thank you Ali you might have been right behind that I don't know Rangers 1 Liverpool 1 and offside flag is up against Liverpool free kick for Rangers 10 yards inside their own heart so so one won the score it's whizzed by Jonathan this first half wasn't it? Jordan's been a good game it has been a good game range of coming to wake up the first goal but the Liverpool reply about it is a good game good technical game tactical game. The Greg at clearing from inside his penalty area to Arfield who passes it back to Barasic who gets it down and Barasic passes the ball forward and Arfield is beaten by Henderson and Liverpool come forward Gomez not seeing very much of that at all Gomez getting forward down the right hand side but he is now deep into the full back position here's the cross only half cleared away comes out to Fabinho 25 yards from goal little pass to Elliott Elliott threads it back through to Cavalio but Rangers are able to clear it through Lundström on the edge of his box Van Dijk form a Celtic man hence the boobs and then Firmino towards Cavalio very busy little figure Elliott then back again to Fabinho Fabinho to Henderson Fabinho just nipped in ahead of the referee to keep possession for Liverpool now Gomez on the right hand side Liverpool suddenly parked inside the range as hard Jürgen Klopp stands watching with his hands clasped behind his back and Liverpool go all the way back to goalkeeper Allison again start once more through the middle Cavalio is beaten to it by Lundström and now Lundström forward to Trollak who's on the right hand side Kent's trying to get there in the middle but Trollak's passes to her right across the front of of Kent who made the right run but the delivery from Trollak wasn't nearly good enough just lacked a little bit of quality but when the brook fair range is the brook at real pace if the ball was better to be fair can I it does well just to max that run just sees him and the ball's out for throwing to Liverpool in their own right back position so one one the Rangers fans behind where Gomez is taking this throw down in the corner are all jumping up and down bouncing up and down together they have not stopped since the start of the game I think they barely stopped when Rangers scored the goal and they didn't stop when Liverpool scored theirs as McGregor hits this downfield headed forward by Fabinho comes back to Goldson takes touch and then just bozzers it downfield Kent is onto this Kent gets the ball down he's running at Gomez Kent into the penalty area back onto his right foot shoots it takes a deflection off the off the carbs of Canardane is behind in the corner Canard it does well to get across and block that he's played well Canardane he's looked really strong decisive in his defending knows what he wants to do made some good blocks some good headers and this one is going to be taken by Barasic left footed out swing out that is down in that corner where all of the noise is coming out of clapping their hands in unison Barasic on the pitch here's the corner which is headed away by Canardane did well good up very high above everyone else to head it away for Liverpool Barasic as Rangers come again Kent lovely little swivel of the hips from Ryan Kent Rangers still in possession Davis back on the halfway line four minutes to the halftime whistle plus added time now Saqala on the right hand side takes on Simicast and beats him and Saqala now pulls it across after he'll regain with a chance but that's blocked on the edge of the six yard box and Liverpool are able to get it away well played Saqala but here's Nunes at the other end a crucial touch from Goldson just took it away from Darwin Nunes and Goldson actually is taking a knock in there as well so there'll be a little stopping Saqala was sharp so sharp when past Simicast 1v1 pace power electrifying but what a block from Canardane has stopped that from going in the goal what a block he's been magnificent in this first half Canardane it was a chance for for our field but his shot was was blocked and and Goldson could have a problem and actually there's a potential penalty check as well another potential penalty check but that's quickly finished that checks over so I think Conagolson be coming off it looks like a that's a problem looks like a thigh strain I've had plenty of them in my career but he does look like one he did he immediately he clutched the top of his thigh didn't he and and that does not look good for Conagolson he's an important part of this van Broncoest Rangers team he started 17 of the 18 matches they've played this season Conagolson and so as I said James Sands is there on the substitute bench there's the youngster as well of course Leon King the very highly rated youngster I don't know whether you've seen much of him other than the match last week but they're they are talking very glowingly about what he might be able to do in the game yeah I spoke to a to a few people about them they said how good he was and he's got a great future ahead hopefully he keeps an improving progressing you know for young kids these days it's okay to get the chance but can they keep on pushing on can they keep that hunger inside them to go to the next level not just happy with what they have at the minute. Rangers 1 Liverpool 1 it is a red button night tonight by the way you can listen to our commentary alongside the final score graphics and the video print it you just press the red button or you you can go to iPlayer or the BBC sport app and click on five by final score and Barcelona have scored in that big game for them against Inter so Barcelona won Inter at 0, Usman D'Ambelli with the goal and here's Roddy King is coming on King is coming on to play in the back four so Goldson that is it and Leon King has been prepared the 18 year old Glaswegian born here in the city this is will be only his 18th first team appearance. I was going to say if Jonathan if you haven't seen him much one of the things that Rangers like about him is that when he brings the ball out of the box he's a good passer generally speaking a good controller of the ball. That's a bonus for us at the back now if you can pass through a line and look at the stash on him. Conceited the penalty last week at Anfield who's a little unfortunate Liverpool were all over him at the time but you learn from those experiences. He'll have an opportunity now to stay in the team because Conor Bowles are coming off of the fast during normally take three to six weeks sometimes longer. So here he comes. Take care for him looking a little nervous as he was on the side of the pitch just clapping his hands Roddy. By the way that also means that Rangers have lost their principal target for set pieces in the Liverpool box. Goldson is usually the man they aim for. So Rangers won Liverpool won and Rangers losing Conor Goldson they've not had much luck with Rangers with injuries Rangers this season particularly in me in the central defensive area as well. Hellender is still out John Souter had an ankle operation and now Conor Goldson is out and Rangers go to Motherwell at the weekend. Here is Jack but Jack is a judge to have fouled Fabinho and the referee has blown the whistle and brought it back for a free kick when Jack thought he might be away through towards the edge of the penalty area. So one won the score added time at the end of the first half. Three minutes have been added on and Fabinho forward towards the Liverpool goal scorer Roberto Firmino and then Gomez trying to find a way through between two Rangers men which he has good strong play from Gomez and then Firmino to Cavalio. Cavalio now is forced from left to right but Harvey Elliott is there. Elliott goes back in field towards Henderson. Henderson square first time touch lovely from Fabinho. Now Timmacass on the left hand side Timmacass with the early cross but McGregor is able to go down quite comfortably and catch the ball on the edge of the pitch. Past Fabinho there wasn't it knew what was around him. Great, great pass, great weight. Yeah lovely touch. So one one here still Tottenham leading Eintracht Frankfurt. Three one having gone behind and early at Napoli made it four wins out of four in this group with another goal filled match for two the final score against Ajax in the and the Diego Maradona stadium. Cavalio on the halfway line turns the ball to his left, Nunes takes on King, beats him and then Nunes flights the ball over the top but Elliott can't reach that. He let it drift over his head and it just caught the surface and bounced the way through for a goal. They're always difficult balls to control. I like that about King. He tried to bring it down his chest and try to play. He made a little mistake but that's the life of being a center half. His decision making but he didn't the right thing. It was just a bit too big. But I like that and center half try to bring it down instead of just heading it in in Evernor. It's going to go. Try and bring it down your chest and play. Jonathan Woodgate with us here at Ibrox on the on the gantry at the front of the top tier of the Bilstruth stand. I actually saw Bilstruth's old walking stick which was in the old manager's office yesterday. He has Nunes who wins a free kick on the halfway line. Henderson waiting to take this. It's a real old farmer's style walking stick with a glazed sheep's horn for the head of it. I could do one at the miniature. Back's not in great form. As you pointed out earlier, not for the first time in your career. Only the last. Van Dyke, long pass forward which is headed away by Barrisic. First half is almost done. In fact, the first half is done and that's been entertaining. One one, Jonathan. It's been a really good, really good first half there. Rangers started quietly but then got into the game. A good goal which they deserve downfield running off the back of Fabinho but then they'll be disappointed Rangers that Liverpool come back in so quickly with a with a Femenio header which being a good game to 50-50 game now this in go either way. So yes, our field for Rangers their first goal in this group stage, their first goal in a Champions League group for 12 years. Scott Arfield scoring it but Femenio equalising with a header from the Sumitcast corner seven minutes later and at the break it's Rangers one, Liverpool one and with us here on the gantry shoulder to shoulder with us Kelly Cates. It is something of a tight squeeze but it's all right because we all know each other. John Murray and Jonathan Woodgate back for the second half of this game at Ibrox. It's one all as John said at halftime. Ruddy Poseid also alongside me and Ruddy has been much better from Rangers and what we saw at Anfield and they did exactly what you wanted them to do which is be brave. Well I was having a look at the stats halfway through the first half and at that point in the first game Liverpool had hit the 80% possession mark. This time Rangers were ahead not much 52% but even so it represented a huge difference in the way the game was unfolding and at that point incidentally a week ago you'll remember that Alan McGregor had had to make three big saves. He scarcely had to touch the ball this evening so from that point of view Rangers will feel comfortable but not overconfident I should imagine in the dressing room. Yeah very finely balanced at the moment. Brad Friedel is also with us Brad what were your thoughts on that that first half? Yeah it's been an even game. It's a good game to watch for the neutral I would imagine. Rangers are far more competitive than they were when they went to went to Anfield. They had another really good chance at Canada I believe it was the one who made it a vital block. I think it was a fairly soft goal for Rangers to concede they'll probably be disappointed with that. I would imagine in the second half time being at 1-1 we'll see a a little bit improved Liverpool side but right now this match is entirely in the balance. Jonathan it doesn't look like anything that we don't know about these two teams that we've seen out here on the pitch but what can we expect in the in the second half of this one? Both managers were saying they want to win the game they can make changes off the off the bench Salah can come up for Liverpool and make a real difference but both teams want to win so I'm expecting to see more goals both teams won't be happy with the draw. One all then a half time at Ibrics it's Rangers 1 Liverpool 1 Brad Fielder will be back with us at full time in this game. I've already precise Jonathan Wood getting John Murray here on the gantry at Ibrics. It's half time between Tottenham and Eintracht Frankfurt. Alistair Bruce Ball is watching this for us and after a shaky start it's been all Tottenham Alley. Yes well put Kelly all smiles and joy at half time Tottenham leading Eintracht Frankfurt by three goals to one I can see that Marseille are two nil up a way to sporting this evening so Tottenham as it stands at half time actually leading the group. Not so convincing at the start the goal they gave away came in the 14th minute playing out from the back loose touch from Eric Dyer it ended up in the back of the Tottenham net Daiichi Kamada the Japanese international scored the goal and Tottenham again just struggling to get going it went to the old combination the Kane and Son link up that got them back in the game just six minutes after they conceded lovely pass from Harry Kane to release Son from the halfway line he made no mistake with the finish eight minutes later Kane won a penalty via a VAR review I'm not quite sure how the referee didn't see it in real time it looked fairly obvious to everyone inside the stadium but he was sent over to the monitor came back out pointed to the spot and Harry Kane as he so often does stuck it away and then they saved the best till last Son's thumping left foot volley to make it 3-1 it's Hoibieg's cross from the right and Son met it so sweetly almost took the net off he very nearly had a hat trick late in the first half as well so Tottenham well on top they're leading Frankfurt by three goals to one Ali thank you very much for that that part of a busy evening of Champions League football and a busy night for our football reporter John Bennett John is a big 45 coming up for Barcelona yes so far so good for Barca thrilling first half of the new camp Barca no if they lose tonight they crash out of the Champions League but they have the lead against Inter Barcelona won Inter Neal Usman Dembele with the goal from close range just before halftime great work by Raphinha and Sergei Roberto to set him up but Barca do deserve it they've been the better side but Inter's Eddin Jekko hit the bar earlier in the game and the ball bounced on the line so they got a bit lucky there if Barca win by two goals they'd move above Inter it's Barcelona won Inter Neal and John for Club Rouge they've made history this evening yes they've booked a place in the last 16 for the first time since the modern format of the Champions League was introduced and Neil Neil draw against Atletico Madrid was enough to book their spot great performance particularly by Sima Minule in goal they'd have nine attempts to make it out of the groups before they've never done it they have now only the second Belgian team to reach the last 16 of the Champions League in the same group at halftime it's Balevaques and Neal Porto won Javi Alonso's debut as a Champions League manager they're unfortunate Balevaques and they missed a penalty and had a goal disallowed and as Ali mentioned in Tottenham's group it's sporting Neal Marseille two the goals for two former Premier League players Matteo Guendouzi and Alexis Sanchez thank you very much for that John there is also one game in the championship this evening it is currently goalless about five minutes into the second half of Bristol City against Preston Northend we're going to get to the news very shortly on Five Live before that though there is a huge developing story in rugby union wasps have been suspended from the Galaga Premiership and they're likely to enter administration within days this weekend's match with Exeter has already been called off and we can speak to our rugby union reporter Sara Orchard Sara this just is another blow in what's been a really difficult period for English domestic rugby yeah evening Kelly and I don't think anyone can argue now that domestic rugby in England is in a full-blown financial crisis first we had Worcester just last week now wasps this and rumours that more clubs could be in trouble and the worst news is from a club that you know it's eaten at the top table of rugby union in Europe a six times premiership winner two time European champions it just shows that the club system is now screaming out for reform and questions are starting to hang over the rugby football union and premiership rugby tonight to see if they can actually lead rugby union throughout the rest of this crisis without more casualties Sara they're playing at the the Coventry Building Society arena at the moment but would the move into administration have any effect on that yeah this is where it gets really interesting and of course this is where we talk about football as well so the freehold of the CBS arena it's held by Coventry City Council they granted wasps a 250 year lease that was when they moved in eight years ago now it's a big complex it's got casino conference centre it's not just the stadium the council did warn the club that any insolvency proceedings could see them forfeit that ownership now the future ownership of that stadium is going to remain that huge focus because there's been the news circulating that the american billionaire john McAvoy he's considering a bid to buy the ground and its other tenants which is Coventry City now earlier today there was a statement from the sky blues they said we are aware of the statement by wasps group today and remain in contact with them regarding the current situation but yeah that could have a huge saying on the future of the rugby club so sorry i know there's so much up in the air at the moment but what happens next uh well the first thing to say is as we said right at the top uh administration has consequences already wasps they'll be suspended from the premiership relegation next season and then if the players are not paid they will be within their rights to leave however wasps could argue for a no fault insolvency due to covid now Worcester have actually done that today so Worcester are fighting their suspension and relegation so much of the consequences of the administration won't be confirmed until a later date thank you very much for that sarah at sarah orchard they're bringing us up to date with everything that's happening in the galaga premiership with the news that wasps have been suspended and are likely to enter administration within days of course we'll keep across that developing story on five live sports coming up next those second half commentary of rangers against liverpool it's one all at halftime in this champions the group stage match but before that we're

his first child due in november and there's no place for open at alex lee's who's played england's past 10 tests but missed out on a central contract former liverpool and totlem goldkeeper brad friedel is still with us brad ahead of the second half of this game between rangers and and liverpool it hasn't been liverpool back to their best but there was certainly urgency at times we saw signs of some of the creativity that they can they can have they have on offer what do you expect from them in the second half what do you think they have to do well i think they now know the fight that rangers are going to give them i think yurgen clock will be contemplating who who in fact he wants to bring in as the substitute you know he's got a a wealth of talent on the bench and jota robertson salah tiago so we'll see who he wants to bring in i'm sure he would like to rest all of them before they play banchester city if he can so if they could score an early goal or two but if he but he's also going to want to get the three points on the board so i think the big thing for yurgen clock and liverpool is who who are they going to bring in with with a little bit of an eye on that manchester city picture obviously rangers have already been forced into a substitution in in defense with the injury to golds and kings come on in his place the 18 year olds who play that anfield but it's an opportunity there for liverpool's what at times sort of front three or three forward players if you like there's cavalli is in there nunyes is in there but there's the experience of reberto femeno and ian says on social media femeno's having one of those just give the ball to bobby games he said he loves that man how impressed have you been with with him and the contribution that he's made in that first 45 minutes yeah it looks very comfortable very confident he's a skillful player i think cavalli's i wouldn't say struggled is a harsh word but it you know he lost the ball in the goal and he's um he's found the physicality a little bit difficult for menos ben uh been liverpool's best player especially going going forward uh scored the goal i think you'd question the defending on the goal but yeah he's he's an important piece to this and with a new with a young inexperienced defender i'm sure he's going to try to expose that and i think rangers on the on the other hand are going to try to expose uh gomez a little bit more in the uh in the right back position for liverpool what have you made of darwin nunyes who've managed to to get a few appearances in a row together for liverpool it's start interrupted obviously by the red card that you got early on in in the season what what do you thought of him tonight when when players come into the premier league some players just hit the ground running and uh and some even though it doesn't matter sometimes how good they are how good they turn out in the premier league it just takes them a little bit of time to get used to the league far too early to make uh decisions on him but it's taking him a little bit more more time to get flowing i think uh it's a bit unfair that when they first came in a lot of people were comparing them to holland or to as you can see completely different players and holland can't stop scoring and nunyes needs to find his feet i think uh jürgen klopp very rarely gets signed in is wrong so i'm sure we're we're gonna see the uh the best so to speak the best is yet to come of nunyes um he hasn't uh he hasn't been that consistent as of uh as of yet but i think uh there's a there's a good player in there no doubt we've seen it that's why liverpool signed them so let's hope for liverpool that he can uh he can start the fire brad for now thank you very much brad for you the lsback with us at full time in this game here at ibrics but taking you through the second half is jonathan woodgate and john murray yes thank you kelly rangers one liverpool one in this champions league group a match day four as you a for call it and liverpool players out there on the pitch jordan henderson just chained up his teammates no further changes at the break so rangers having made that change that uh that we mentioned migregor in goal tavernier substitute king davis and barisic jack and lundstram sakala arfield kent and cholak and liverpool with allison in goal gomez canate van dyke and simikas the back four fabinho and henderson in the middle then elliot mainly on the right carvalho mainly on the left and femeno and nunyes as the uh the frontman in the middle but it is quite fluid as jonathan woodgate was saying in the first half jonathan woodgate former england defender is here with us at ibrics second half underway and liverpool already a long throw his liverpool play from right to left as we look in our excellent position very close to the pitch uh but rangers have the ball back inside their own half and uh and it is leon king who brings it forward but then as nunyes comes across turns it back to uh to gulki but migregor so what do you think what do you think second half jonathan said earlier both team need to win the game they have to win the liverpool want to win the game so they're off in the group and to start that mentality again and rangers want to prove they don't play at this level uh sakala just tackling back and catching simikas the ball bounced up to sort of shoulder height didn't it he put the challenge in coating the man three kick to liverpool it's also arranged that if they get the ball down the sides of the two liverpool full backs they'll cause them problems as they showed in the first half with ken and sa sakala they were really aggressive at times and need to do that more in the second half yep simikas has done pretty well actually this is the fifth match in the row that he started well uh andy robertson's being out the robertson is on the substitutes bench tonight so it'll be interesting to see if we see him tonight with manchester city on sunday in mind salar on the bench as well tiago as liverpool have it centrally and here is jon henderson henderson short pass to femeno femeno is able to move to his left might have just been caught there by lun stramp but was able to find the pass to carvalho plenty of tricks from carvalho he's beaten tavernier he's beaten sakala and now femeno gives it to elliott and elliott works it to the right to colmers who's arriving and shooting into the legs of davis and the ball bounces away for rangers the awareness of femeno he must have had he must have eyes in the back of his head he's just constantly head on the swivel looking around he knows the tick jake and see it outstanding player movement we had a great view of that didn't we in that as you've met here is femeno again femeno playing at square on the edge of the box elliott gets it down and shoots but he shoots straight into barrisage liverpool again though they're they're really cranking up the pressure on rangers here in the early moments of the second half elliott oh lovely round lun stramp and he was caught lun here he'd been beaten and just caught him down went elliott free kick to liverpool right of centre just a bit too quick there elliott wasn't he once i'm just lunging at him but we were saying earlier there john about femeno you saw that bit of movement that's called opposite movement so he goes one way then he comes the other brilliant bit of movement wasn't just to see it how like sharp it was but in the same way so clear to see it fantastic there and the earlier in the past to to gomez as well stonathan says you know we could see that he was not looking just expected gomez to arrive which he did gomez's shot was bought he's never scored for liverpool gomez free kick bill this is uh this is quite quite an acute angle over towards the right hand side so uh tim mccaster's there henderson is is talking to him uh the rangers wall is being set up three four men in the rangers wall still the referee is is speaking to uh to those rangers players in the wall ryan jack on the end of it is just turning and talking to his gulky baton the greggat who is a couple of yards off his line simicast has just placed the ball again henderson moves away to the left and behind the ball tim mccaster to the right and simicaster but he's absolutely ballooned it high over the top of the wall never threatened the goal never threatened to threaten the goal and it was into the uh lower tier of the brunelands stand to our left in the championship bristol city one freston nill is the latest scorer ashton gave robert atkinson opening the scoring the underway in the second half as well at tottenham where spurs are leading eintracht frankfort by three goals to one but all square here one one where rangers are looking for their first point or points in the champions league for 12 years having scored their first goal our field first man to score for rangers in the champions league group since kenny miller who is here tonight here's sycala sycala moving in field might have been fouled but it was taken up by jack who gives it to tavernier and tavernier's cross towards the back post is headed down jack very nearly got there but van dyke did and was able to clear it away inside the six yard box that's rangers best moment so far of the second half and you can hear what effect that has had on the the almost 50 000 rangers fans there are 2600 liverpool fans in the corner on the opposite side away to our left dry night and we can see the moon now and what a moon it is as well up beyond the uh the cobalt road stand throwing taken by rangers our field goes back to the halfway line and then it all comes all the way back to king inside his own half king rolls his foot over the ball and gives it to the right hand side but tavernier high ball lands beyond jack who's running onto it but van dyke was able to get there first and simicast turns it in field fabinho back to simicast just had two more turn it that rolls out of play and a little exchange of words between simicast and fabinho and now lundstrom playing it forward but that was block and liverpool break forward and nuniez back to henderson and henderson plays it behind nuniez it'd be interesting to see what he does with this he's done well with it he's giving it to carvalho and carvalho takes on king and now nuniez is into the penalty area but lundstrom recovers well puts in the challenge and it bounces behind for a corner liverpool it's acting brilliantly well it's what the midfielders need to do with towns when the full back gets drawn out in the centre out it doesn't go across there's a big gap lundstrom does it really well good tackle on daun and nuniez it bounced back on the nuniez you know that should have been a goal kick i think i think i'm right insane that just saw it on the screen in front of us uh rangers one liverpool one five live radio mercy side from the bbc and bbc sounds as well the sirens are going off here is simicast deep corner towards the back post which is headed away comes out to henderson and misses his kick snowboard one hit height here a swing and a miss but fabinho's behind him and that's an overhead pass from fabinho and it just bounces straight through for a goal kick so let's hear for the first time since the second half began at tottenham from alistair bruce ball tottenham three frankfort one nearly four one early in this second half rishardliss and did brilliantly on the right hand side just killed a delicious cross into space sessony on its acted and frankfort managed to scramble it away corner coming for tottenham they're leading three one as it stands they are going to be a point clear at the top of a very tight group day uh and uh another one of the great portuguese clubs porto are now winning two nil away against by aleva cusin that's in the group where it finished atletico madrid nil club bruce nil and inter have equalized against basalona nicolò berella the italian international has made it one one liverpool winner free kick on the halfway line jonathan i was just glancing at that score when the uh when they won that free kick but henderson's going to take a quick leap to for me no that's a lovely turn from him liverpool's goal scorer their number nine slips her through the noon yes who shot his block davis did well went with the urequire and was able to to put in a challenge at the uh ball rolled wide away at the pass of femenio there to nunas just wanted that extra touch there nunas but femenio's a joy to watch when his play like this he's an absolute joy watch you can see why the liverpool fans absolutely adorn yeah they need him as well with dias out with this injury that he picked up on sunday but that now for femenio this season that's seven goals in his 12 appearances this season uh as elliot wins the ball back inside his own half and looks to get it back liverpool looking to break first pass was missed actually but fabinho's onto that and gomez plays it over the top to nunas and nunas goes for goal early but swept this shot as it bounced down on the half volley from what 25 yards and that was over by about six yards over the top of the ball it's the being incredible finish from it put that away one more touch maybe maybe just reset it but he fancied it though he fancied it way over the crossbar yeah it would have been if he caught it as he wanted that would have been an absolute snorter elliot heading the ball out to gourmet on the right hand side and gourmet who really is getting forward in this second half and his ball across femeno is there and side footed in six yards out a beautiful finish from liverpool's top scorer this season two in the match for him and liverpool who will one mill down here at ibrox now lead by two goals to one and two for femeno it was brilliant from gourmet the pace down the wing the weight of passing to femenio femenio read the line beautifully but water ball in by gourmet he's on side and all he had to do was composure femeno want to finish he's been the star player if you're looking for a player he's been absolutely outstanding from minute one stood up for liverpool lovely on his left foot actually chucked it underneath my Gregor and into the net range has won liverpool two now and Roberto femeno what a start this is what what a start i mean his best season if you remember for liverpool was um back in 2017 2018 when he scored 27 goals in all competitions but since then since then it's been 16 12 9 11 but already now eight this season probably why though john if you look at it he sacrificed himself for the team he does that much work off the ball and the liverpool fans appreciate that because of the work rate he does and he sacrifices his goal input to supply like Salon mani when he was here liverpool now ahead in the match on the course with this score line to make it three champions league group wins in a row and ranges scaring at the feet but if you haven't been listening this match has been much more of a contest than last week although it could hardly be less carvalho chipping the ball across elliot then chips and now for mino is on a hat trick down towards the dead ball line for mino finds carvalho and then for mino back to uh to Henderson Roberto femeno who is also out of contract at the end of this season and liverpool have put the ball out of play canate because ryan jack has gone down and um he i think will need some treatment ryan jack i'm not sure what's happened there but the uh medical people come on but out of contract at the end of the season seemingly uh there's been there's been no word yet of whether there have been talks about the possibility of extending it but remember he is 31 years old but if you look at the impact the femeno is going to have on the younger players carvalho elliot all the young players coming through that system he's going to have a huge impact on them i was in my pro license today with one of the liverpool coaches under under 23 coaches and he said femeno trained with him for a few days and he said he was absolutely brilliant attitude first and foremost ability secondly he was just great with all the lads he's the type of character who who talks to younger players you don't always get that in football yet sometimes you get senior players you can be quite arrogant femeno was the total opposite and a true gentleman and he's just short on it i've got years by the way yeah well i mean that touch he made it look simple that finish and uh you know he's a he's a sort of friendly faced individual isn't he with a smile and those lovely teeth of his of course that dazzles you ryan jack that that's going to be it for ryan jack steven davis roddy's coming on steven davis and that's normally this is the stage of the game that where steven davis goes off so they're bringing on legs that have happened there on the east so um liverpool with the ball inside their own half and leading by two goals to one playing at the moment with ten men because ryan jack's evening is over that the veteran steven davis waiting down there started at anfield last week the 37 year old northern island international yes henderson henderson playing the ball across towards van dyke with this scoreline of course it would confirm that rangers would not be able to qualify for the last 16 of the champions league this season but liverpool coming forward with elliot who passes it back still are playing with ten men because the ball's not going out of play rangers so liverpool with van dyke forward towards noon yes we've talking about femeno but really you know we should be talking as well about gomez and the role that he played in that goal femeno chipping the ball over the top that's headed away by davis on the edge of the area henderson now out towards the right hand side gomez with a touch and now a little elliot will take it on quick feet from him almost salalike passes the ball into the box to cavaglio and cavaglios crosses headed away by davis and liverpool have cranked it up in this second half they've got that second goal to go in front but it was almost alexander arnold like the the role that gomez played in that goal he has elliot again does well beats barrisage leford had shot is straight at the gregar who was able to catch the the bouncing ball into his chest so sharp harvey elliot but you're on there about uh about gomez there it was it was a brilliant ball in to swerve it around it was a either needle stuff to get it through to to femeno and you you know it's almost as if we yeah i can imagine the talk at halftime to to gomez to get forward from jürgen klopp and he has carvalho as liverpool come forward again sweep forward they do nunya has now saw the chance to shoot but he shot into the legs of cavania and rangers have been able to clear it away and there's a liverpool man henderson is down inside the liverpool harvon rangers finally it's been played with 10 men there for probably three three minutes or more but uh he's on now rangers number 10 and why they make that change back to alice the bruce ball at totem totem three frankfort one eintracht frankfort now down to 10 men brazilian center back two ta sent off two yellow cards in quick succession the second one he just couldn't handle son kade had already been fouled referee was playing in advance if son had turned him he was trying to get away on go and two to dragged him down red car totem three frankfort one jordan henderson i think is okay jonathan he's certainly back on his feet again as goleman passes the ball forward and gets it back on the halfway line and jordan henderson now in possession yep seems okay yeah he looked like he's got a little clip on the ankles by lungström but he's fine now he's walking now and i can see jordan has wanted to come off in this game calio does well there under pressure from two rangers players pulls them off finds the pass down the left to timie gascicala tracking back puts in the tackle liverpool have upped it in the second there's no question there's no question yet exactly of whatever jorgen klopp said of them half time they've upped the ante they've upped the gears and it's hard for rangers because this is the full of a really top team to one liverpool lead earlier if you haven't heard nappily won four two against iax in this group rangers have still got to go to nappily liverpool's next match is away against iax their next match in the champions league liverpool with it back to uh frank gike uh simicast plays the ball off well thought it had taken a touch off haven't he but it didn't so it's a throwing the rangers just down in front here our position just left of centre actually we're looking more or less across the middle of the the rangers defensive half and they cross the halfway line with barricic and barricic is past looking for kent the gulness defensively does his good work there and liverpool played up towards nunyes again rangers trying to re-establish a foothold really in the match because liverpool now dominating them from the back from substitute king his pass for sakala but simicast wins the header that bounces out of play and it's a throwing to rangers near the halfway line go back for victoria plitzen who are now full one down by in munich and the referee's attention has been drawn by something down here in front of us tiago who's warming up with four of his teammates i think the referee is suggesting that tiago is straight onto the pitch while he's been warming up and the referee is telling tiago that he can't come over the white line and tiago is saying i've not been over the white line and behind the white line i think it's the blue marked lines for these insisting go all that if you're warming up yeah and tiago is actually pointing to the white line but anyway it's a bit petty isn't it in the rest it's slightly petty from the rest you can't come over the blue line get a big chicken are you waiting for that one though won't you righty that would be a big blue tick or a white tick players also don't like the run on the astro turf by the way over the blue lines grass but you have a sides astro their total now three nil up on by a lever cousin lever cousin nil portal three and the ball banks is out of playing the other halfway line over on the far side for throwing two rangers is you're just keeping an eye on tiago down there who is um he's jumping over the blue blue line on big right you know the door light run on astro turf if you watch him but run on the grass bit he's getting some of that light he's all of that blue light here's van dyke chesting the ball down inside his his own heart anyway the point's been made and that's the important thing uh allison to the halfway line car valio he's uh he has caught the eye tonight car valio has me i like him yeah really good first yeah first champions league start full of a pull for for him long one forward and the Greg has come into his full back position clears the ball over the head of tiago he's mounding his pees and cues down there and it's out for a throw in for liverpool so uh tiago actually kicks the ball back to simicast is really really risking it now fabinho then back to van dyke inside his own heart to one liverpool lead liverpool manchester city at anfield on sunday five lighters the place to hear that and uh intact now lead barcelona by two goals to one in the new camp so uh lautaro martinez has scored the second four inter who are two one up on barcelona who could be in trouble in the champions league liverpool preparing to make a couple of changes and salar is coming on jonathan down there so more salar will get the last 25 minutes or so of this match and also i think that's andy robertson it is yes i can see his number 26 now so he's going to make us come back the scotland captain the former seltic fan will make us come back here at ibrocks so uh ma gregg at inside his penalty area clears the ball to uh fabinho does well holds off davis and plays it through and for mino and nunyes with the shot talks it away three one liverpool lead so simple right through the middle of the rangers defense and after rangers were in front tonight in the first half now it's going to be liverpool's night again surely after that rangers won liverpool three and dawin nunyes scores his fourth goal for liverpool do you know when you talk about world class anyone watching the television tonight or listen on this radio station now the touch from reverto for minio was absolutely world class world class it's like a croif i can't really describe how good it is it's like a croif turn but it's a brilliant brilliant assist and dawin nunyes fair play it takes his time side for lovely finish it's a sort of flick with the with the outside of his heel right into the path of uh as i said the back i never done that much job rolled it just into the path of of nunyes who was what 16 yards out given the angle and just took it away with his right foot and rangers won liverpool three is the score dawin nunyes four goals for liverpool now yet to score it anfield and booze for andy robertson as i say the former selvic fan who is coming on and uh simercast and henderson are off and tiago won't have to worry about crossing that line down there anymore because he's on the field he can do what he's what he likes now about that three decent subsa so salah tiago robertson robertson yeah and uh and that's it for dawin nunyes his night's work is done and he's got and he's collected another goal tonight he got his goal i wouldn't say it was the most complete performance from a nine i've ever seen but he's got his goal his confidence is going to grow don't forget this season he's played in a struggling liverpool team at times that's not easy and the urgen plot making those three changes there you know three one up manchester city on sunday and uh you know the decision there was instant from urgen plot uh preston have equalized at ashton gate bristol city one preston won andrew hughes with the equalizer for preston 745 kickoff that one eight o'clock start in these later matches in the champions league of course and uh and liverpool on the way to victory you would think barring some remarkable comeback for the ante they've up the ante in the second half and you know it's okay for teams to stay with a two to 45 minutes it's a 90 minute game and liverpool have just gone up levels that's jonathan woodgate with us on five live tonight here at ibrox we'll have more from brad friedel later as well five live sport on air till 10 30 tonight and uh we'll try and bring you the interviews if you don't hear them tonight we'll be on the football daily podcast which you can download for free subscribe bbc sounds for the football daily podcast and they say it's a red button night as well so you can listen to the commentary alongside the graphics of video printer if you click on five live final score ball played forward for sakala but uh now with captain zonband on van dyke is able to push her in the way but it comes back to davis and now cavernier on the edge of the box with tavernier placing behind lunds from it has to go back into the center circle four ranges for once in the second half liverpool having to defend here they've certainly gone up the gear or two in the second half after what was you know quite an evenly contested first 45 minutes or so but ranges with it on the left hand side here's the cross barisic into the area looking for cholak in the middle but it was headed away by van dyke and now lundstrom is able to send a cushioned volley back to king in the center circle ranges go out to the left again barisic the Croatian international back to one of the englishmen in the in the ranges starting lineup then davis and now king into the center circle lundstrom glides onto this king has salah now hovering around in front of him so turns and plays the ball back to go keep back the greger so ranges with it inside their own half leading by three goals to one so both of the premier league clubs with a 3-1 lead tonight 3-1 here in Glasgow to Liverpool and chopped them 3-1 up in london against eintracht frankfurt 20 minutes to play and the atmosphere has definitely taken a hit follow that after that darwin nunia's goal here's tiago through the middle clips the ball forward salah takes it down shoots into the legs of McGregor who is attempting a kind of star jump and the shot from salah hit his legs and bounced away but so far has been able to get the ball past van dyke and so far a pleasure to cross but the covering challenge was there the slide from from canardy i think they're saying the ranges fans that it might have struck an arm of canardy on its way back to allison but the referee's not interested one into the other last season salah you're backing to score that it's good to say about McGregor but then on the counter attack the other end so kala was on a race with van dyke a good block in the end by canardy at Liverpool with tiago lifts a pass out to the left hand side now robertson robertson drives it across elliot brings it down and elliot got it all wrong and actually lifts it to the back post where robertson bolleys it across but it was already out before the robertson body and elliot there he actually had some space there inside the penalty area and just nace hit it never done that an awful lot of time to be honest with you john i couldn't control a ball like harvey elliot could control a ball we all have missed it uh jorgo jokler is going to be the next Liverpool man to to come on there was a link yogan club suggested didn't he before the the match in one of the interviews that he gave that there was a bit of a question mark all about his uh fitness so they weren't going to take a risk with him but he must be okay because he's coming onto the field and uh it's revert all for me no who's leaving the pitch tiago comes across the the two of them have a little laugh together and uh and here he is leaving the field now replaced by jorgo jota two goals and also that lovely assist for nunyes standout performer by some distance for 72 minutes it's been a pleasure to watch him play this game i think he's being brilliant when liverpool have needed him he stepped up to the mark like you say john two goals and outstanding assist and if it is the case but there's not yet been any talks about a new contract i think if i were revert all for me knows representatives i think i'd be making noises wouldn't you liverpool behind the scenes regarding like contract negotiations they know exactly what they're doing julie ward he's a new sporting director doing a brilliant job shadowing mike ledwoods over the last couple of seasons i'm sure they'll have that all all on lockdown yes and i'm sure his representatives don't need me to remind them what to do i suspect they're quite sharp there's the ball bounces out was playing on the halfway line they tend to be don't they those those types they don't miss many tricks do you know exactly what they're doing yes they do he's learning off michael as well so he's in good hands uh range is going to make another change and it's uh scott right who's going to come onto the field oh allison almost gets himself into bother but is able to turn and play the ball away just does well actually in the in the end against cholak and it was helpful but it comes back again and allison has given bandag a big shout there and bandag allows the ball to bounce through to little croft turn outside of the foot pass it has gone wrong from in the past before but it has tonight range is one liverpool three bristol city are back in front robert arkinson scored his second goal of the game so bristol city two one over that's in the 90th minute and here comes jota for liverpool to the edge of the area plays it square carvalho's onto this shoots into the legs of tavernier and then on the uh as he tried to keep possession i think he was caught referee allows play to continue elliot goes for goal and it dips narrowly over the top of the crossbar from what will that be 20 yards plus on the right hand side let's bring in ready for sight again so you know the metondo is also going to come on so we're going to see a double substitution here with range is presumably trying to take the game to liverpool for the last 15 minutes and you would imagine it would be either our field or so cala who would make way when there's a fact more relice is also going to come on so that looks like the end of the night for one striker who hasn't had a touch on goal game thank you roddy range is one liverpool three ranges on the back foot again though before they can make those changes uh clearance from the king bounces back into the area salah has threaded it in super finished from salah and the liverpool fans behind them in that corner all rise to their feet to acclaim mo salah who's threaded it in i don't know how he found the space there and liverpool now lead by four goals to one here at ibrox was it an incredible touch brought it out the sky took it on a six pence water touch there was spin on the ball and everything and then finished past mcgregor nonchalant just tore pokes at home mcgregor probably didn't think he was going to do that but it's literally a tore poke into the far corner jogan clops reaction was very graphic by the way if you get the chance to see it he seemed an extremely contented man at that stage and here come the rangers changes and we're just seeing a replay of jogan clops face bump punch of the face and rangers making these changes now so uh sacala makes way shalak replaced by morellas scott right is on as well for ryan kent so matondo on the right hand side did well when he came on it at anfield last week but that the game's gone level pool leading by four goals to one uh victoria plitzen who were four nailed down mind you have scored a second goal so plitzen two by in munich four and uh free kicked rangers on the halfway line that lunstrand is looking to take so matondo on on the right and right on the left if i can put it in those terms here is tavernier on the in the full back position the level full back position and in slights king with the challenge uh little rangers were fortunate there to get the ball back davis plays it towards the edge of the penalty area it's worked square back to davis davis now to tavernier but a stretch from andy robertson who wins and uh robertson back in action for the first time since naples when liverpool started with that full one defeat but liverpool themselves winning four one here so for rangers on their return to the champions league now it doesn't look good does it four nil away to iax three nil at home to nappoli two nil at anfield and four one down here to liverpool in the return match it really has been a step up that they've not been able to deal with it's a step up in in pure class and you've seen that in the in the second half jam with just the performance of femenio with salo coming on and scoring a goal darwin nunes wait they've raised the bar in the second half liverpool and and rangers haven't been able to stay with them it's understandable by the way you're talking about different budgets and different players altogether so liverpool are on a different a different wavelength compared to rangers financially yeah we were making that point last week as well liverpool are going to bring james milner on next to replace canate so jill gormers i guess will move across into central defense while they do that let's get another update from alice to bruce ball at totland 12 minutes to go totland three eintrout frankfurt won a procession really two two was sent off for frankfurt on the hour mark son has come close to his hat trick again totland looked to have eased off it a bit big game in the premier league against everton here on saturday son and kane are still out there though and as things stand totland are going top of group diggers marseille still tuning up away to sporting totland three frankfurt one here yes that totland everton game is our 530 commentary match on five live this weekend and wolves nottingham forest is the three o'clock commentary match with ian denis and chris waddle and uh and five live will be the place to listen to liverpool against manchester city on sunday liverpool who lost one of their last 42 home matches in all competitions incidentally salat playing the ball forward from the halfway line but elliot can't reach that and it's out of play for a pro deranger i love it when you give me them stats jump i absolutely love it well it must be a big crisis mustn't it for liverpool when you've lost just one of your last 42 home matches here's that jota playing it through salar on the edge of the area or this could be ominous it is it's another one for salar it's a fifth for liverpool and this now really has a re-evalve embarrassment about it for rangers who led on the night but now find themselves five one down to liverpool the finish from salar he's been on the pitch pitch what seven minutes he could have had a hat trick already but he's finishing his finish there he just stopped the ball he put his abs brakes on and just bent it past migrega not much of a salar brace it's probably like a thing to say i'm still here i'm still there there was an extraordinary finish and he slows himself down puts in rolls his foot over the ball and migreger has no chance two goals in four minutes for salar 76th and the 80th minutes of the match and rangers won liverpool five and it's the liverpool fans now you can hear the 2600 a sore of them in the corner of eyebrows celebrating joyously and what has been a night that really had so much promise for rangers in the first half particularly that r-field goal the first goal that they've scored in the champions league for 12 years now this score line i mean this is quite ugly isn't it for them you wouldn't have expected it when they came out to the second half you wouldn't expect this score line because rangers were well in the game but here they come again liverpool got world class players here they come again jotter has given it to salar who scored another he scored a hat trick a quick fire more salar hat trick and out rocks left foot whip across migreger into the far corner and he scored three goals in five minutes a hat trick in five minutes at eyebrows for more salar after coming on as a substitute it's like it's a brilliant it's a brilliant finish but migreger stands absolutely no chance he just bends it around if you can imagine more salar coming in off the left and just bends it in the far corner it's it it's a brilliant finish but do you know what when your manager leaves you out over team you come and score a hat trick like sondid for torknum when conny left him out the team salar has done exactly the same well that is absolute champions league dynamite from more salar and it means the score line is now rangers one liverpool six and i'm afraid the rangers followers will be reaching for the record books now with a score line like this six one down at home in the champions league and there are lots of empty blue seats appearing around all of the the four stands of i've rocks in the home sections and it promised so much in the first half the rangers but liverpool had just left them behind in the second half second half and just blown them away it's like an eight eight hundred meter run first four hundred meters you're in it the next four hundred meters you're out with it and here they come again salar who's just scored his fifth hat trick for liverpool gives it to elliot and elliot now looks hungry as well and elliot plays it through and jotter and salar back to jotter inside the area rangers gratefully scramble it away relief that there wasn't a seventh in there rangers with right right overheads the ball downfield and allison's got it comfortably for liverpool on the edge of his own penalty area what a miserable experience this is you know that excitement i was there the night that the chalak scored that goal in eindhoven and rangers got back into the champions league you know they dream they dreamed of it i mean they still get the riches around about 30 million pounds or euros i think it is that you know it's so important for rangers but on the pitch i mean it's turned into a nightmare and actually when you think about it there's tiago fouls right on the halfway line and that's a free kick and it's not going to be a yellow card if he just gives the free kick it has turned into a nightmare for rangers it has you're dealing with a top player in salar just to come off the bench and make that difference with femenio top top players who do it at the top who really do it when when the game needs something to produce the goods when they talked about the lack the people saying lack of form the produce and both players femenio and salar have done that in this occasion bristol city have beaten preston by two goals to one so that is bristol city's first win in six matches been a poor run just one point in that time but they've beaten preston tonight with two goals from robert adkinson and also basa lona have made it two two levendowski has scored for basa lona and that is is two two now at the new camp so rangers one liverpool six is the remarkable scoreline here at ibrox it was one one at half time and liverpool have scored five goals in the second half salar's got three of them nuniez femenio got his second of the match before he went off and rangers are looking absolutely ragged as millner plays the ball back to allison in the penalty area behind him and now thousands of people have left ibrox there are there are so many there are thousands of empty seats as tiago you can't blame them those great nights those great nights that they've had over the years here at ibrox and european competitions but liverpool have just absolutely run away with it and here is diogo giotta running away with the ball down the left wing giotta who is challenged by king in the ball bounces behind for a liverpool corner from the left hand side you feel you feel for rangers john because first half a really good performance but second half like i said previous when world class players turn up it's hard to stop them here's robertson walking down into that corner he's only been on the winning side once before against rangers in old competitions back in his dundee united days and here he is down in that corner taking this set piece for liverpool to the near post but that is up and headed away by steven day this tiago lovely touch gives it back to to robertson bit of swagger about in there great way for liverpool list to warm up from anchester city on sunday as carvalho and robertson combined on the left hand side carvalho into tiago tiago a reverse pass to salah who plays it across and an important stop but there's ali at the score as the ball bounces to him but the offside flag was up against giotta in the middle who had the first opportunity that was blocked so rangers get away with it this time joss will be disappointed to finish it in the first place because again more salah carvalho does really well tiago no look pass that's that's not offside oh they're checking and this could be a goal it's not offside the uh they are checking to see if this ali at goal will stand and he's waiting to find out play the players have gone back to the halfway line the referee is waiting he's saying wait to mcgregor and this could be seven one still we wait on the big screens in the corner of eyebrows it says goal check var harvey ali at waiting with mo salah on the halfway line to find out if he has scored to make it seven one and the referee still stands still we wait for this decision harvey ali at who could have scored his first champions league goal is still waiting mo salah standing with his arms on his shoulders it must be very very tight still we wait the Liverpool supporters are giving it the big wind up and the referee just waiting for the instruction here comes he's got his whistle to his mouth there's the rectangle he points to the centre spot and harvey ali at has made it seven one what a score line this is and he actually runs on his own ali at from the halfway line after that long delay to wait and find out if the goal would stand to run towards the Liverpool supporters now his teammates go towards him as well the 19 year old has scored in the champions league for the first time and it ranges one Liverpool seven he's deserved to have the ali at because in the game when it was getting a bit sticky in the first half he always wanted the ball and he always tried to get on the ball and make something happen and he's deserved that goal and you could see all the players were absolutely delighted for him young kid first goal in the champions they were a brilliant moment for him well it is a record breaker this for Rangers in the way that they wouldn't have wanted their the heaviest home defeat previously in European competitions was a 4-0 against Juventus in the champions league group stage back in 1995 and I'm just looking to see if it is that the heaviest defeat in all and it is it is the heaviest defeat in European competitions if it stays like this let's bring in Ruddy again well they had a 6-1 6-3 defeat by over two lines against Eintracht in 1960 that's what I've got as the heaviest previous the and a 5-0 as well against Cologne but this this beats them all Rangers won Liverpool seven back to Tottenham Alistair Bruce fall well this one not over just yet 10 man Frankfurt have scored from a corner Mario Goertzer killed it in Evan and Dicker headed in from close range to Tottenham just got to be professional here and see this one out we're in the 90th minute it's Tottenham three Frankfurt two Rangers have got a free kick in the middle of the Liverpool half the fourth official is just coming forward with the board one minute about a time one minute how many substitutes those are likes of mercy well it is isn't it I mean I didn't think you away if I did that but clearly they do I mean that's ridiculous but I don't think anyone in a blue shirt will will mind and there's a red card check now going on three kickers taken though so that's not going to transpire the check is over and here's Tavernier on the right hand side Tavernier is able to get over the cross to the back post as there was a sandwich there the back post on Matondo but he didn't go down and Liverpool were able to clear it away so one minute of added time and what a nightmare this has been for Rangers in the second half and the bulls just overrun by Matondo although it's taken a flick off a Liverpool leg and it's through and it is a corner for Rangers I'll make it we've got 10 seconds left of time to play and Rangers I think this corner will be the last action of the match it's not going to change anything this on the scoreboard above where the corner is being taken one seven is on the big screen here's the corner into the middle it comes out for the shot that is blocked on the edge of the area still Rangers have it Tavernier is is fouled but that's the final whistle and it's a chorus of booze inside Ibrox from the home supporters what a scoreline we've got here tonight Rangers won Liverpool seven and it was one one at half time and this is Rangers record defeat in any European competition it means you'll have gathered they cannot now qualify for the latter stages of the Champions League the knockout stages after Christmas but what a nightmare second half for Rangers and Liverpool themselves now just need one more point against Ajax to take their place in the last 16 more on this to come the first to Tottenham Alistair Bruce Ball yeah not quite sure what's been going on this evening John Harry Kane just missed his second penalty this season he's away now though clear on the left hand side crosses the ball in towards Brian Hill the substitute who threw himself at it couldn't convert he was the one the young Spaniard who was tripped in added time some was off the pitch I don't think came would have let him take the penalty anyway for the hat trick and Kane very unusually went for power and smashed it over the bar Tottenham are leading on track Frankfurt by three goals to two we've got about two minutes of added time remaining and as it stands with the win Tottenham will go top of group D but a very rare sight there Kane's smashing a penalty over the bar Tottenham leave Frankfurt 3-2 so the players are still on the pitch here at Ibrox there is an eerie atmosphere inside the ground compared to what it was like just before the match you know when this place was absolutely bouncing one one at halftime now it's just the Liverpool fans in one corner that you can hear so one one at halftime after Rangers took the lead through our field but Firmino made it one one and then those six goals in the second half one for Firmino one for Darwin Nunez that five-minute hat trick from substitute Salah and then Harvey Elliott at the end getting his first Champions League goal after the VAR check so Rangers won Liverpool 7 and Kelly Cates is here with us inside Ibrox Jonathan it was a completely different Liverpool that we saw in the second half of that game it's spelt at times this season that they had another gear to go to we just haven't seen them kick on this game they managed to do it what was the difference you think you just witnessed how good they were in that second half and what that Liverpool team can do but it was it was the three in Firmino Cavalio and Harvey Elliott who really started getting on the ball and really started dominating it and Rangers struggled to pick them players up at times they didn't the first half but second half especially Firmino produced a lovely goal his flick through what we said in commentary was absolutely world class and then they bring more Salah on it could have had actually four goals I mean Liverpool had nine shots on target and scored seven so it was a totally different ball game from first half to second half. Liverpool clinical in in the second half of that game with that 7-1 victory at Ibrox for Rangers Roddy Forsythe it's a heavy defeat seems a long time ago that we were saying right Rangers have got their first goal of this this group stage they looked on course for all three points at that stage Liverpool pulled it back and they went in level at half time it's not just this defeat which ends their chances of qualifying for the knockout stage of the Champions League it's the demoralising effect that this could have. I believe I used the word respectable at halftime because Rangers seem to have come to grips with Liverpool it looked like an open even contest it could go either way instead what we have is a result that you will not be allowed to forget in Glasgow and I just wonder now and I would say this that Giovanni van Broncos now has a future that must be limited at Ibrox you just can't sustain defeats of that nature the board will get it too but on his record that's an immense blot even if he got the tactics right in the first half so and when you actually look at the how many goals is it 16 goals they've conceded in this group and so four goals a game they've conceded and this is a team that reached a European final last season so the gap between what the supporters thought they were going to get this season and what has actually happened is colossal now
