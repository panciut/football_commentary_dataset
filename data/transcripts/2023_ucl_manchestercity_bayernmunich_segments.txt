[0.00 - 6.00] P:1569.45 E:0.080019 |  That won 7-0 here against Leipzig to equal Manchester City's biggest European win.
[6.00 - 10.16] P:1619.58 E:0.097479 |  Three changes for Bayern, Cancelo, the City Lone drops to the bench for them,
[10.16 - 14.88] P:1470.46 E:0.105132 |  former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane and German great Thomas Müller are amongst the subs as well.
[14.88 - 21.12] P:1673.61 E:0.087899 |  So Leon Goretzka, Kingsley Coman and Dioppa McCano come in there without their top scorer.
[21.12 - 26.64] P:1636.57 E:0.103864 |  The former Stokeman, Eric Maxim, is supermoting, he's had a brilliant season but he's out with a knee injury.
[26.64 - 32.16] P:1641.77 E:0.088851 |  So we are underway in front of a full house here in Manchester at the Etihad.
[32.16 - 38.64] P:1601.56 E:0.096083 |  Bayern Munich getting us underway playing in their red home kick kicking from right to left in Manchester City
[38.64 - 42.64] P:1613.89 E:0.099442 |  with the Sky Blue shirts, the white shorts and the Sky Blue socks picking up possession
[42.64 - 46.64] P:1637.81 E:0.108248 |  with Grealish down the left hand side taking on Benjamin Pavar and getting passed in brilliantly.
[46.64 - 51.20] P:1661.94 E:0.097889 |  Grealish to the edge of the area slides it in, De Bruyne won't quite run for city in the box.
[51.20 - 55.20] P:1684.74 E:0.098076 |  De Bruyne is trying to win it back, Bayern trying to get the foot in but Arno still was up there as well.
[55.20 - 58.88] P:1721.13 E:0.096823 |  De Bruyne lifts the ball up to the back post it's over the head of Gundogan
[58.88 - 64.08] P:1694.71 E:0.092002 |  who will pick it up on the left hand side and out to the left he goes with Nathan Akke.
[64.08 - 69.84] P:1623.93 E:0.096195 |  Manchester City will slow it down just and pull it back to Diass but my word Deon didn't they
[69.84 - 72.16] P:1540.40 E:0.107496 |  start with some energy there having won the ball back to Bayern.
[72.16 - 76.40] P:1809.07 E:0.094172 |  Just great work just making sure they clear their lines getting the ball out wide to Grealish.
[76.40 - 78.96] P:1651.10 E:0.091283 |  Grealish has no help at all he thinks right.
[78.96 - 81.84] P:1733.72 E:0.106820 |  Pavar I'll have a run at you no problem at all let's see what you've got.
[82.48 - 85.52] P:1623.65 E:0.103025 |  Brie's past two players and nearly created something for City.
[86.08 - 90.88] P:1635.03 E:0.092728 |  Yep great start from Grealish who says he believes he is in some of his best form of his
[90.88 - 95.28] P:1583.76 E:0.097068 |  Manchester City career at the moment but here comes Gnabry into the penalty area for Bayern
[95.28 - 101.52] P:1609.19 E:0.092396 |  lead away at the back by Ruben Diass got a little deflection as well but picks up on that left hand
[101.52 - 107.04] P:1637.54 E:0.095772 |  side by Bayern Munich and they'll send it all the way back to the halfway line and Matias
[107.12 - 116.08] P:1621.34 E:0.093819 |  delict to squares it to Upper Meccano so Bayern Munich in possession and out on that right hand
[116.08 - 120.24] P:1642.47 E:0.098179 |  side almost stolen by Harland on the halfway line but Kimmich will keep hold of it and here they
[120.24 - 125.36] P:1698.56 E:0.086714 |  come down the right now by Bayern with Komen frenetic pace to this game in the opening two minutes
[125.36 - 130.48] P:1746.68 E:0.091038 |  here on five live in this Champions League quarterfinal Akke gets the block in will spin away to Diass
[130.48 - 136.32] P:1642.21 E:0.091597 |  cleared away up towards Harland on halfway and will be picked up by Upper Meccano wants more
[136.32 - 142.80] P:1558.66 E:0.088223 |  dicks the ball forward but Akke will steal possession and clear out to the left hand side
[142.80 - 149.52] P:1608.56 E:0.093413 |  so we get our first look at this Manchester City formation and it's an interesting one so far
[149.52 - 155.04] P:1628.21 E:0.087881 |  John Stones just dropping back at the moment into central defence but he can step up into that
[155.04 - 158.56] P:1542.67 E:0.101168 |  three man midfield with Manchester City in possession but at the moment it's
[159.12 - 166.08] P:1620.53 E:0.088741 |  Bayern Munich so Stones dropping back as the ball is over the head of Manuel Acangia will
[166.08 - 170.80] P:1615.19 E:0.096017 |  bounce out of play but interesting Dion that it Stones going central and Acangia coming over to
[170.80 - 176.80] P:1587.82 E:0.083664 |  this right hand side when it's the fourth visit yeah and I'm slightly wary about that and you
[176.80 - 180.80] P:1628.60 E:0.102549 |  know what Sarny's pace and against Acangia I'm not sure how that's going to work we'll see how the
[180.80 - 186.24] P:1599.50 E:0.092522 |  game pans out I mean on the other side you've got Akke against Kingsley Komen as well I mean he dealt
[186.72 - 191.52] P:1694.96 E:0.090460 |  with Saka in the lead quite uh quite effectively maybe they're backing him to deal with Komen again
[191.52 - 198.08] P:1666.59 E:0.076798 |  one on one so Nathan Acke has it over on the left hand side and now with City in possession they do
[198.80 - 204.48] P:1742.89 E:0.087698 |  switch to that back three with Stones in midfield so in possession the City formation for now is
[204.48 - 209.60] P:1612.42 E:0.088463 |  Edison in goal as Acangia under pressure from the former Manchester City man Levera Sarny and
[209.60 - 215.28] P:1728.99 E:0.089595 |  Edison came to clear that ball out Acangia decided to square it instead to Ruben Diaz
[215.84 - 220.32] P:1684.72 E:0.092866 |  he did the right thing he did the right thing he did the right thing he did the keeper came
[220.32 - 224.56] P:1678.01 E:0.093916 |  running out I mean Karen will tell you better you want your defender to deal with that don't you
[224.56 - 228.64] P:1950.99 E:0.090496 |  yeah I mean ideally you don't want you want your defenders to defend and the goalkeeper
[228.64 - 233.28] P:1750.78 E:0.089840 |  obviously as good as Edison is like any sort of hesitation is is going to be dangerous in terms
[233.28 - 240.24] P:1502.66 E:0.081281 |  of the way this Byron Munich team has started this game I think so Edison in possession inside his
[240.24 - 244.64] P:1494.24 E:0.090507 |  own penalty areas Ganabri the former Arsenal man waits just outside the ball so Edison
[244.64 - 249.20] P:1646.57 E:0.088350 |  in goal for City the back three of Acangia Diaz and Acke ahead of them Stones and Rodri sitting
[249.20 - 254.64] P:1658.11 E:0.097595 |  to Brunner and Gundam out ahead of them with Silver Greenish and Harland up front as the rain
[254.64 - 260.96] P:1646.85 E:0.094885 |  begins to team down here at the Etihad the wind's swirling as well difficult conditions as Bernardo
[260.96 - 267.52] P:1626.47 E:0.085761 |  Silva picks it up on the right hand side up against Stumpenso Davies the Canada fullback so pulls it
[267.52 - 272.72] P:1575.32 E:0.090218 |  back to Gundawan just outside the penalty area and now Stones will lay it off to Rodri close down
[272.72 - 278.80] P:1550.47 E:0.091429 |  by Ganabri but Rodri dinks it out to the left hand side and here is Jack Greenish plays it in field
[278.80 - 284.24] P:1631.35 E:0.096380 |  to Kevin De Bruyne and back to Greenish once more as the wind whips up around us strong isn't it
[284.24 - 290.32] P:1618.74 E:0.092356 |  it's really strong we're low down here in the bottom tier at the Etihad but you're blocked normally
[290.32 - 294.32] P:1707.91 E:0.095894 |  from the elements we are blocked from the rain as Harland picks it up into the penalty area Harland
[294.32 - 299.20] P:1784.16 E:0.097092 |  left hand side drives over the bar right into the city crowd but but normally you don't feel any
[299.20 - 302.56] P:1774.42 E:0.100803 |  impacts of the wind in the fact that we're hearing it at the back of the press box here and
[302.56 - 307.36] P:1770.15 E:0.097955 |  I'm feeling that breeze around us it just shows the challenge of the conditions out on the pitch
[307.36 - 310.96] P:1798.65 E:0.095928 |  for these players yeah it's got to keep the ball on the grass as soon as that ball goes in the air
[310.96 - 315.76] P:1788.80 E:0.086070 |  it swirls in the air then it's a bit of a freefall so they'll both want to get the ball on the ground
[315.76 - 322.80] P:1781.18 E:0.078149 |  play through the third see what happens half a chance that for for Harland I think yeah 44 goals
[322.80 - 329.12] P:1526.49 E:0.081784 |  for the season would have perhaps expected a little better from Manchester City's main man although
[329.84 - 335.92] P:1415.58 E:0.099809 |  whilst from distance on the angle there's Manchester City have it on the halfway line with
[335.92 - 341.20] P:1534.14 E:0.091626 |  Johnstone so by Munich with Sommer in goal deputizing for their regular number one Manuel
[341.20 - 346.40] P:1515.19 E:0.079137 |  Neuer who's out for the season coming in done well the Switzerland international though after
[346.40 - 351.04] P:1523.11 E:0.087220 |  arriving in January from Borussia Munich glad back following Neuer's injury so he keeps goal for them
[351.04 - 357.76] P:1662.64 E:0.076432 |  the back four of Pavar, Apermeccano, Delict and Davies ahead of them Goretzka, Masiala and Kimmich
[357.76 - 364.96] P:1647.95 E:0.073433 |  with Coman, Sarno the former City man in Gnabry formerly of Arsenal up front as Pine Munich pick
[364.96 - 371.04] P:1761.28 E:0.085463 |  it up on the right hand side and send it all the way back to Jan Sommer all in black this evening
[371.04 - 376.48] P:1723.44 E:0.080443 |  who plays it out to the highest delict and out to the left hand side and Alfonso Davies have
[376.48 - 381.12] P:1735.99 E:0.091252 |  enjoyed such a good World Cup with Canada went down in history for them as well scoring their
[381.12 - 387.68] P:1576.56 E:0.081463 |  first ever goal at a World Cup finals it's played forward to Kimmich who plays it forward
[387.68 - 393.68] P:1623.74 E:0.084750 |  down the centre if you call the run of Masiala but he won't reach it Manchester City pick it up
[393.68 - 399.36] P:1693.34 E:0.101792 |  once more DLW yeah he does that really well Stowe's if he sees any danger if City give the ball away
[399.36 - 404.96] P:1766.90 E:0.088044 |  he'll just drop maybe into that right backer who he might even go inside Akangy and drop in between
[404.96 - 410.00] P:1771.09 E:0.097740 |  Akangy and Diaz just to make a four again so I think that's why he's allowed to play that
[410.16 - 414.96] P:1706.97 E:0.091009 |  role in their stones he's very intelligent he knows when to go he knows when to stay
[416.00 - 420.96] P:1607.61 E:0.090975 |  six and a half minutes played here in Manchester and we are goalless in this Champions League
[420.96 - 426.64] P:1613.56 E:0.090129 |  quarter-final also goalless in the other quarter-final also kicking off at eight o'clock in Fika against
[426.64 - 433.76] P:1605.79 E:0.093382 |  Inter and a reminder we have full commentary of Real Madrid against Chelsea live from Spain tomorrow
[433.76 - 438.56] P:1664.16 E:0.091523 |  three one five live as Bernardo Silva advances down towards the bar line depending by Davies
[438.72 - 444.08] P:1695.76 E:0.110188 |  slated off to De Bruyne who swings the ball in and Kunduam is there and Kunduam met it just
[444.08 - 449.28] P:1731.37 E:0.100541 |  behind Arlen who missed his header and Karen Barzli it's one of those where Manchester City would
[449.28 - 452.72] P:1644.48 E:0.096280 |  have hoped that Arlen just got there ahead of Kunduam but he didn't and it's over the bar oh
[452.72 - 458.08] P:1783.64 E:0.088123 |  it's a beauty I mean Bernardo Silva does so well to to work Davies and get some space to create for
[458.08 - 462.72] P:1675.49 E:0.095009 |  himself and he sees obviously Kevin De Bruyne at the edge of the area but whips in a beautiful cross
[462.72 - 467.92] P:1753.12 E:0.083356 |  I mean we've seen that so often to find that back post you know overhead kicker header from
[468.16 - 472.72] P:1702.38 E:0.081195 |  Harland and unfortunately just didn't connect this time yeah got one against Southampton at the
[472.72 - 480.56] P:1652.30 E:0.086359 |  weekend of course beautiful finish from a man who is looking to score his 45th goal in all
[480.56 - 488.16] P:1676.54 E:0.091638 |  competition stop it please stop it please that is just oh my word by a minute when the ball just
[488.16 - 492.08] P:1663.97 E:0.085788 |  inside their own half it would set a new record if he does score for a Premier League player for
[492.08 - 497.76] P:1750.51 E:0.080191 |  goals in a single campaign in all competitions he come by in turn the right hand side lay back to
[497.76 - 503.28] P:1764.74 E:0.077178 |  the former Manchester City man in Rosane now Kimmich the Germany midfielder to his compatriot
[503.28 - 511.20] P:1463.80 E:0.091559 |  Goretzka all the way back to the tyres delicts by Munich as we mentioned enjoying a very good
[511.20 - 518.32] P:1649.73 E:0.085626 |  Champions League campaign so far for this Thomas Tuchel's fourth match in charge after the surprise
[518.32 - 523.28] P:1607.38 E:0.083930 |  dismissal of Julian Nagelsmann last month he's been knocked out of the German Cup in the quarter
[523.76 - 527.60] P:1638.66 E:0.085126 |  finals that was a shock by Freiburg two big wins though in the league particularly
[527.60 - 531.44] P:1564.14 E:0.088906 |  over their title rivals Borussia Dortmund in his first match in charge which took by
[532.08 - 537.28] P:1500.33 E:0.091388 |  top of the Bundesliga they lead it now by two points ahead of Dortmund and it's one of those
[537.28 - 542.56] P:1604.90 E:0.092008 |  games that really could be title deciding by Munich fans will certainly hope so here they are in
[542.56 - 548.64] P:1693.24 E:0.084918 |  possession with Sane back to the left hand side plays it in field two and comes out Davies and
[549.04 - 554.24] P:1629.05 E:0.103927 |  Sane once again taking on Pernod Silva runs into Rodri and Pernod Silva will pick it up over the
[554.24 - 560.80] P:1696.96 E:0.099985 |  halfway line pursued by Sane still going very good challenge by Kimmich and delict will send it
[560.80 - 565.68] P:1752.69 E:0.095451 |  back to Sommer, Arland is closing down but Kimmich is going to be such a key player for Bayern in the
[565.68 - 571.20] P:1699.48 E:0.094439 |  centre of the park. Yeah they seem to just look for him to keep things steady get the ball to him
[571.20 - 577.28] P:1775.74 E:0.095844 |  and he'll just keep it moving he won't go too far staying up in the middle of the park and dictate
[577.36 - 583.12] P:1682.85 E:0.078081 |  things great challenge that Tomon Bernardo Silva was rescuing tackle not such a great challenge
[583.12 - 589.76] P:1656.61 E:0.077357 |  by Rodri on Masiala right in front of Thomas Tuchel he wasn't happy was he? So free kick to
[589.76 - 595.20] P:1572.69 E:0.085737 |  Bayern Munich and they get us underway once more nine and a half minutes plays here on five live
[595.20 - 602.32] P:1614.82 E:0.080680 |  goalless in this Champions League called a final first leg here is Alfonso Davies for Bayern just
[602.32 - 608.96] P:1605.82 E:0.079686 |  inside the Bayern half plays it back to delict and a permecane all the way back to Jan Sommer as
[608.96 - 615.20] P:1682.10 E:0.084892 |  Manchester City send Rodri up to joins Arland and De Bruyne just outside the penalty area and
[615.20 - 620.08] P:1726.27 E:0.085470 |  Bayern then play over that press he was Gennabry out to the right hand side midway through the
[620.08 - 626.08] P:1732.18 E:0.082511 |  Manchester City half and now Kingsley Coman it's marshaled well by Ake and Grealish so
[626.08 - 630.40] P:1552.29 E:0.093534 |  in field by and go Kimmich now plays the ball over the top opportunity here to get the ball into
[630.40 - 634.40] P:1665.28 E:0.092782 |  the area Kingsley Coman has it taken off his toes inside the box by Gundawan. Bayern picking up
[634.40 - 640.08] P:1751.82 E:0.095113 |  once more though out to the left hand side they go and Davies will drive it's wide and let's add
[640.08 - 645.92] P:1859.36 E:0.092298 |  for an update from England against Australia at Brentford Kelly Summers. 26 minutes gone Vicki

[650.88 - 655.28] P:1680.99 E:0.104299 |  the world have started well here Lauren Hemp is getting some joy on the right but the Matildas
[655.28 - 659.28] P:1556.09 E:0.104289 |  are holding their own and they do look dangerous when Sam Kerr breaks the ball's fizzing around
[659.28 - 664.32] P:1557.92 E:0.098380 |  to on this wet surface perhaps part of the reason this game hasn't truly settled and Vicki this feels

[709.84 - 714.48] P:1714.65 E:0.087224 |  is made by Kimmick and bounces out of play for Manchester City throw Vicki you know what I'm
[714.48 - 719.60] P:1879.79 E:0.085192 |  just noticing as well speaking of the winds swirling around if it's just blown Edison's towel onto the
[720.16 - 727.20] P:1728.33 E:0.077518 |  end line over there so that might be moving yeah one of the ball boys or ball girls might need to
[727.20 - 732.32] P:1610.96 E:0.085390 |  spot that it's just inside the six yard pops at the moment by that near post for Edison

[823.28 - 829.44] P:1721.31 E:0.082407 |  ball across cleared away by Kimmich at the back for Bayern out to the left hand side of the area
[829.44 - 835.20] P:1759.71 E:0.092758 |  where it's picked up by Nerozana and he's dispossessed by Kandji and Bernardo Silva has it once again

[852.48 - 857.84] P:1789.65 E:0.101208 |  to Ian Stick in a nutshell absolutely that's the spark that this is this game needed a spark it was
[857.84 - 864.56] P:1775.77 E:0.101894 |  that challenge on Bernardo Silva right in front of the referee's assistant and then it went a little
[864.56 - 868.88] P:1821.77 E:0.098287 |  bit messy they tried to play across the box the keeper doesn't like that surely not even not two
[868.88 - 873.44] P:1843.72 E:0.105710 |  yards of no no no I hated that I'm not gonna lie anytime the ball was coming across the face
[873.44 - 879.44] P:1680.85 E:0.081927 |  in the mouth the mouth of the goal oh I had to I need to put my foot through that Manchester City
[879.44 - 885.44] P:1592.65 E:0.083488 |  take the throw great pressure by Harlins summer just about doing enough to get the ball away
[885.44 - 891.04] P:1434.30 E:0.098142 |  they've won another throw Manchester City level with the edge of the Bayern Munich penalty area
[891.04 - 895.52] P:1579.95 E:0.098372 |  goalless as the Etihad raises it's for his Harlins trying to turn inside the penalty area but
[895.52 - 901.44] P:1610.50 E:0.101260 |  is challenged and then late challenge by Grealish on Coven right on the edge of the Bayern Munich
[901.44 - 907.84] P:1771.95 E:0.087224 |  penalty area free kick to Bayern Munich and this may be a stern talking to and nothing more from
[907.84 - 914.56] P:1711.91 E:0.083228 |  Jesus Gil Manzano to Jack Grealish but gotta be careful with those sort of challenges it is a clumsy
[914.56 - 920.96] P:1720.35 E:0.096051 |  one see on it is yeah I think Jack was he I know Jack musically well he can't get frustrated when
[920.96 - 925.20] P:1644.14 E:0.100633 |  he's been manhandled all his teammates have been manhandled he likes to get involved and
[926.16 - 930.56] P:1669.41 E:0.089035 |  let his opponent know that he's not gonna accept being kicked all his teammates being kicked that
[930.56 - 935.28] P:1723.77 E:0.088330 |  was a little bit late from Jack bit messy but get the ball forward to Jack as soon as possible
[935.28 - 938.56] P:1772.13 E:0.095540 |  and to Bernardo wide as well because that's the way they're gonna get in
[939.84 - 944.16] P:1695.44 E:0.094452 |  former England striker Dion Dublin and former England and Manchester City goalkeeper Karen
[944.16 - 950.88] P:1682.34 E:0.077219 |  parsley here with us on five live this evening 15 minutes gone goalless as Manchester City win
[950.88 - 956.24] P:1580.45 E:0.088585 |  a free kick just inside their own half lifted over the top by Ruben Diaz out to Grealish on the
[956.24 - 962.56] P:1707.38 E:0.086386 |  left hand side beautiful control but the pass is just behind Harlins and here comes Missy Arlow
[962.56 - 966.96] P:1687.31 E:0.096691 |  for Bayern Munich played him fielding out to Missy Arlow once again left hand side well
[966.96 - 972.40] P:1769.56 E:0.102972 |  anticipated by Bernardo Server at Kanji then as well to slide in and keep possession for Manchester
[972.40 - 977.12] P:1761.07 E:0.095569 |  City full goes out of play for a throw to by and Pep Guardiola's furious he's out of his technical
[977.12 - 982.40] P:1714.21 E:0.088312 |  area he wanted a free kick for a foul on a kanji yeah I think I think it was a free kick and City
[982.40 - 985.60] P:1644.15 E:0.098541 |  giving the ball away as well I think Jack gave the ball away the understanding between Jack and
[985.60 - 989.52] P:1623.29 E:0.088191 |  Harlow they're not quite clicked yet but he's not happy with the way that they're giving the ball
[989.52 - 993.76] P:1694.84 E:0.086375 |  away and he wants him to squeeze quicker that's the motion we're seeing that's the way that City
[993.76 - 1001.04] P:1614.14 E:0.074668 |  have to play that's the way that City always want to play here is a pomecano I think it's center half
[1001.12 - 1007.76] P:1610.88 E:0.083953 |  full by in played forward now through the third to Kimmich and now out to the right hand side as
[1007.76 - 1013.04] P:1602.34 E:0.080549 |  by an advance once more he lists Kimmich once again just outside the center circle played it back to
[1013.04 - 1018.32] P:1740.84 E:0.094168 |  the pomecano and Karen Bartley 16 and a half minutes gone it's from fairly even so far but but
[1018.32 - 1022.72] P:1702.76 E:0.085545 |  City looking the more dangerous in and around the penalty area yeah I think um I think Dion you've
[1022.72 - 1026.64] P:1819.20 E:0.091558 |  set up beautifully at Harlins with his predatory instincts he's always ready to capitalise on
[1026.64 - 1032.16] P:1651.75 E:0.078121 |  anything here come by and out to the right hand side with Coman Missy Arlow is in the center
[1032.16 - 1037.28] P:1660.38 E:0.090341 |  Coman pulls it back to Gnabry 20 yards out thought about the shot Missy Arlow then slips on the edge
[1037.28 - 1044.64] P:1757.37 E:0.086156 |  of the D out to the left hand side Alfonso Davies and now Sane into the area blocked away by Akangy
[1044.64 - 1048.32] P:1705.96 E:0.088933 |  who brings it down very nicely as well but can't complete the clearance there will be a throw to
[1048.32 - 1055.12] P:1660.13 E:0.079228 |  buy in deep in Manchester City territory Alfonso Davies was kind of taken a little bit further
[1055.12 - 1059.20] P:1461.81 E:0.088071 |  up the referee just isn't forward but eventually takes it pretty much from Raffi Wells anyway
[1059.20 - 1064.48] P:1549.41 E:0.093353 |  and Byron have the ball on the halfway line here is a for McCona stepping past Harlins
[1064.48 - 1070.24] P:1592.46 E:0.080717 |  lays it off to Pavar and out to the right hand side with Coman by an imposition just inside
[1070.24 - 1074.16] P:1650.53 E:0.093224 |  their own half there's been a goal in the match between England and Australia Kelly Summers
[1074.72 - 1080.88] P:1767.89 E:0.105010 |  England nil Australia won 33 minutes on the clock who else but Sam Kerr it was a long ball forward
[1080.88 - 1084.96] P:1800.52 E:0.099568 |  Kerr beat the offside trap Leah Williamson was tracking back thought she had control
[1084.96 - 1090.40] P:1835.12 E:0.105397 |  of it but she only played it into the path of Kerr who tapped home England's 30 match unbeaten run
[1090.40 - 1095.28] P:1653.15 E:0.090681 |  is very much at risk England nil Australia won well well you can listen to commentary of that
[1095.28 - 1099.68] P:1707.22 E:0.081610 |  match over on five sports extra here at the Etihad goal list between Manchester City and
[1099.68 - 1103.52] P:1570.30 E:0.084432 |  Bayern Munich in this Champions League quarter final first leg Scotland's women incidentally
[1103.52 - 1109.20] P:1574.73 E:0.084335 |  are now three nil up in their friendly with Costa Rica that has been playing for 40 minutes
[1109.28 - 1115.36] P:1416.31 E:0.095938 |  Manchester City in position need to weigh through their own half yeah it's it's slowed down a little
[1115.36 - 1122.80] P:1741.44 E:0.080232 |  bit now what City like to do is a crossfielder ball they play one side they play two or three passes
[1122.80 - 1127.12] P:1834.22 E:0.092506 |  on one side of the pitch and then what they do is they draw the opponents in to try and squeeze
[1127.12 - 1131.28] P:1725.08 E:0.091875 |  and then they try and go for the crossfielder ball but tonight Vicky the wind is so bad
[1131.28 - 1135.68] P:1709.96 E:0.088190 |  that they it's not reaching that opposite end of the pitch and they're trying to play through
[1135.68 - 1139.92] P:1747.00 E:0.080400 |  the thirds and it's just not working at the moment for either team yeah it's exactly that as
[1139.92 - 1143.60] P:1658.43 E:0.086561 |  Bayern Munich have the ball just inside their own half they just tried that crossfield switch that
[1143.60 - 1149.20] P:1790.62 E:0.091610 |  Dio was talking about but it held up so much in the swirling air here in Manchester that Pavaugh had
[1149.20 - 1153.52] P:1576.59 E:0.097370 |  the easiest of tasks for Bayern right back just to wait for it to come down and and head it away
[1153.52 - 1158.64] P:1809.87 E:0.092263 |  balls out of play for a city throw Karen Bardsley yeah it has been a really well balanced game I
[1158.64 - 1162.48] P:1772.37 E:0.089235 |  think you know to your earlier point Vicky you know that one chance obviously for Harlan on the
[1162.48 - 1167.60] P:1697.43 E:0.089010 |  end of the the touchline I mean the goal line basically but yeah I think Bernardo's getting
[1167.60 - 1172.88] P:1719.84 E:0.090240 |  that Davies quite enjoying that Stones is picking up some good spaces but I'm surprised that the
[1172.88 - 1177.36] P:1685.98 E:0.082842 |  Bronner hasn't actually been on the ball a little bit more here comes Grealish down the left hand
[1177.36 - 1182.08] P:1416.49 E:0.086147 |  side pulls it back to Nathan Ake he will play the ball into the penalty area the crossfield switch
[1182.08 - 1187.36] P:1702.02 E:0.088619 |  doesn't work for Bernardo Silva tried the little back heel to control it goes out of play for a
[1187.44 - 1193.12] P:1637.42 E:0.090389 |  throw to Bayern and the wind is just the variable that at the moment it's just so hard to predict
[1193.12 - 1197.60] P:1699.62 E:0.094220 |  yeah that tells me that the ball from Ake on the diagonal to Bernardo Silva tells me that
[1198.16 - 1202.32] P:1785.72 E:0.092887 |  that went with the wind because the one over to Jack Grealish actually held it held it up into the
[1202.32 - 1209.20] P:1742.38 E:0.080236 |  center half so it's swirling at the moment and it's all about being patient and going to feet if
[1209.20 - 1213.52] P:1537.66 E:0.089542 |  you can that's what they're doing at the moment Manchester City here is Bernardo Silva de Bruyne
[1213.52 - 1218.32] P:1545.83 E:0.094068 |  on the overlap de Bruyne down to the bar nine cross in first time Gudubama's making the run of the
[1218.32 - 1224.56] P:1732.36 E:0.097652 |  near post it's an excellent covering interception by Joshua Kimmick who gets the congratulations
[1224.56 - 1229.84] P:1681.68 E:0.079626 |  from his teammates it's a Manchester City corner he's absolutely bossing at Kimmick I mean he's
[1229.84 - 1233.92] P:1787.16 E:0.103121 |  been that you know metronome that we spoke about earlier in the week Vic the Kira Walsh role that
[1233.92 - 1238.56] P:1732.62 E:0.086020 |  she was playing for the lionesses just constantly getting on the ball checking shoulders but what
[1238.72 - 1244.32] P:1741.17 E:0.083201 |  what a block that was so corner to Manchester City Kevin de Bruyne is over these from the right
[1244.32 - 1248.72] P:1790.28 E:0.085205 |  hand side drifted in high to the edge of the penalty area will come all the way to Jack Grealish
[1248.72 - 1252.96] P:1644.40 E:0.090928 |  he's now midway through the buy-in half again wind playing havoc with those deliveries as
[1252.96 - 1256.56] P:1523.02 E:0.098106 |  Bernardo Silva plays it out to the right hand side that ball was on the ground but it's poor D on
[1256.56 - 1261.04] P:1718.84 E:0.096810 |  its faster bro and it's out for a throw City just losing their way a little bit in the last five
[1261.04 - 1264.56] P:1655.24 E:0.082060 |  minutes you know what I think that was actually off the training ground that ball from Kevin de
[1264.56 - 1270.24] P:1620.12 E:0.084438 |  Bruyne was purposely missed out that group of players in the six yard box fighting for space
[1270.24 - 1275.04] P:1653.90 E:0.083830 |  and Jack Grealish stayed out on the corner of the box on the other side I think Jack was meant to
[1275.04 - 1281.76] P:1660.98 E:0.072272 |  come forward and take it on the volley slowed it down so buy-in throw goal is here midway through
[1281.76 - 1287.36] P:1597.05 E:0.087066 |  the first half goal is in the other quarterfinal between Benfica and insert as well as Gunderman
[1287.36 - 1292.56] P:1613.90 E:0.102005 |  plays it forward Grealish feet Harlan first time shot it's taken from the edge of the area and
[1292.64 - 1297.04] P:1811.85 E:0.096385 |  some of all Kevin great play though Karen great play little one two Harlan again yeah
[1297.68 - 1301.44] P:1840.93 E:0.099319 |  exactly yeah I think you really should have it I mean great awareness from from Jack to go
[1301.44 - 1305.68] P:1823.44 E:0.094270 |  Jack Grealish to go and press there nice little turn on the bar a little pirouette and ball through
[1305.68 - 1310.72] P:1705.90 E:0.077182 |  to Harlan but yeah I really should have finished it we expect that from him now I think here come
[1310.72 - 1316.00] P:1587.83 E:0.090657 |  by with Ganabri the former Arsenal man out to the right hand side to see win it and then lose it
[1316.00 - 1320.48] P:1698.44 E:0.098720 |  again here is Ganabri plays it forward looking for the run of Lyrissane very well cleared away by
[1320.48 - 1326.48] P:1658.15 E:0.084656 |  John Stone slotting back into that centre half roll from midfield with Candy out to this right
[1326.48 - 1331.60] P:1565.72 E:0.088440 |  back position and the ball will bounce out of play for a throw to buy a minute well all right
[1331.60 - 1335.68] P:1701.18 E:0.087775 |  let's get the former strikers and the former keepers opinion that's the second time in this
[1335.68 - 1340.32] P:1569.44 E:0.096115 |  match and he does like to do this young summer he's taken a touch inside his penalty area Harlan's
[1340.32 - 1345.12] P:1732.58 E:0.082600 |  been right on him as a striker it must be encouragement Dion but as a goalkeeper Karen
[1345.12 - 1349.28] P:1681.36 E:0.097421 |  do you change the way that you play because Harlan's is going to see it I'll tell you why
[1349.28 - 1352.64] P:1833.60 E:0.088056 |  he's doing he's trying to draw the press that's what he's looking for he's looking for an extra
[1352.64 - 1356.56] P:1735.57 E:0.091454 |  option obviously the keeper is the overload at the minute the spare player so as soon as Harlan
[1356.56 - 1361.92] P:1681.69 E:0.083189 |  presses he's got to find that spare player quickly but it's you know he's an absolute unit Harlan
[1361.92 - 1366.56] P:1874.21 E:0.084195 |  like trying to run at you it's like a freight train so it um I can't imagine there's many players
[1366.56 - 1370.16] P:1754.56 E:0.095083 |  that he plays against on the training pitch that are as quick as he is so he's got to release it a
[1370.16 - 1375.84] P:1743.78 E:0.086527 |  lot quicker than that here come by a minute with Lyrissane 25 yards out plays it to Coman
[1375.84 - 1380.56] P:1791.25 E:0.091900 |  right hand side of the area checks one way trying to work room for the shot Ake does well
[1380.56 - 1385.20] P:1753.68 E:0.100811 |  holds him up and Coman in the end all he can do is prevent the goal kick place the ball out of play
[1385.20 - 1389.76] P:1863.48 E:0.098521 |  for a Manchester City throw midway through their own half goal that's lovely from Ake I mean he's so
[1389.76 - 1395.84] P:1827.92 E:0.087072 |  so balanced his approach Coman's obviously changing direction up down uh he's really really agile and
[1395.84 - 1401.12] P:1640.91 E:0.083878 |  well balanced but Ake is equal to it absolutely equal to it well he's one of the players at the
[1401.12 - 1405.76] P:1523.53 E:0.082854 |  moment Kingsley Coman that is in good goal scoring form for Byme unit that had been one of the

[1433.04 - 1439.36] P:1418.20 E:0.088863 |  against Barcelona two games against PSG yes Manchester City tend to score for fun and Harland
[1439.36 - 1444.40] P:1527.29 E:0.091598 |  is foremost amongst that but with Byme in possession still just inside their own half this is one of
[1444.40 - 1448.88] P:1460.95 E:0.095453 |  their biggest tests in terms of a defensive unit that they're coming up against yeah I believe
[1448.88 - 1453.52] P:1635.81 E:0.095428 |  you're absolutely spot on the county misses the header Dave East down to the byline for Byme Munich

[1615.04 - 1621.52] P:1733.85 E:0.088134 |  Rodry 25 yards out plays it to the right and Bernardo Silva Harland is waiting in the centre just
[1621.52 - 1625.68] P:1647.10 E:0.092699 |  outside the six yard box Bernardo Silva has two players there with him and they hold him up well
[1625.76 - 1632.24] P:1687.04 E:0.074168 |  so we'll pull it back to John Stones now Bernardo Silva once more patience required from Manchester
[1632.24 - 1641.04] P:1752.03 E:0.109407 |  City is Rodry big shout of man on as Rodry will kill the epitome what a goal from Rodry just outside
[1641.04 - 1648.72] P:1695.89 E:0.109454 |  the D it's a thunderbolt into the top corner curling past the despairing dive of Jan Sommar
[1648.72 - 1654.88] P:1685.14 E:0.109391 |  a moment of real quality from the Manchester City midfielder it's his first goal in the
[1654.88 - 1661.28] P:1760.15 E:0.105509 |  Champions League and what a stunner it is Manchester City one by Munich nil that's a brilliant
[1661.28 - 1667.20] P:1876.52 E:0.099237 |  finish I've got to say Rodry goes to strike with his right but he chops it on his left foot and
[1667.20 - 1673.28] P:1758.13 E:0.107344 |  I'm thinking go on then use the wind curling in the top corner and he didn't put any pace on it he
[1673.28 - 1680.64] P:1812.43 E:0.100567 |  just left it on the wind he just curled from outside to in round two players Sommar's got no chance
[1681.20 - 1685.76] P:1759.01 E:0.101602 |  carrying the keeper when somebody strikes you like that it's so hard to get across because they
[1685.76 - 1691.60] P:1759.13 E:0.103938 |  set you so far away from the keeper. All I'm saying is like as a keeper you want to obviously get
[1691.60 - 1698.40] P:1711.11 E:0.092416 |  everything you want to be perfect but you can't that is perfection you know wow holy cow just the
[1698.40 - 1704.72] P:1681.25 E:0.104756 |  curl on the ball it's going top bins but that is so poor from gimmick he needs to get up to the ball
[1704.72 - 1712.16] P:1657.26 E:0.104256 |  you cannot allow a player of Raju's caliber to have that much time to open up the goal cut inside
[1712.16 - 1718.48] P:1659.40 E:0.103649 |  and you know put it on his left foot and absolutely like the detail of the curl on that that was a beauty
[1719.92 - 1728.16] P:1683.79 E:0.089571 |  third goal of the season for Rodry a superb strike and Manchester City with the breakthrough here
[1728.16 - 1732.48] P:1583.91 E:0.096658 |  against Bayern Munich Sommar has it at the back for Bayerners they get us underway
[1732.48 - 1736.96] P:1701.17 E:0.092284 |  Heather is won by John Stones out of play for brian throw Pep Guardiola is on the pitch I mean we
[1736.96 - 1741.20] P:1694.48 E:0.103356 |  know he's animated but he's straight out of his technical area the fourth official is meandering
[1741.20 - 1745.84] P:1609.02 E:0.095585 |  up to Guardiola to just point out that fact but it was interesting Dion while the players are
[1745.84 - 1751.52] P:1599.63 E:0.095735 |  celebrating the goal Guardiola and De Bruyne were having a very animated conversation that there's
[1751.52 - 1756.00] P:1635.35 E:0.107920 |  something more that Guardiola wants to be doing that's what it looked like from here absolutely
[1756.00 - 1760.56] P:1638.94 E:0.099801 |  he'll always want more regardless of them being ahead now they haven't quite created the chances
[1760.64 - 1764.80] P:1687.48 E:0.103590 |  that he wants them to and he wants them to press harder that's what they're doing now here they come
[1764.80 - 1769.44] P:1674.48 E:0.087656 |  with Bernardo Silva forward to Kevin De Bruyne takes it down to the corner flag tried to dink it back
[1769.44 - 1774.32] P:1740.17 E:0.099445 |  into Bernardo Silva it's blocked away by the next and it will be a Manchester City throw I think it's
[1774.32 - 1779.04] P:1713.41 E:0.096166 |  so interesting I think just before the goal Kevin De Bruyne started going and exploring on the left
[1779.04 - 1784.16] P:1693.44 E:0.092116 |  hand side here's the ball in from De Bruyne won't be Tarland in the penalty area Ake will chest it down
[1784.16 - 1788.56] P:1702.26 E:0.094258 |  hand ball in there by Ake and it will be a free kick to Bayern Karin and as I was saying it you know
[1788.56 - 1793.68] P:1806.45 E:0.095470 |  he's gone to join up with Jack Grealish and as Silva went down that right side just ahead of the
[1793.68 - 1798.48] P:1823.23 E:0.091165 |  goal I mean you were kind of looking for De Bruyne to get joined in but I think was he wondering if
[1798.48 - 1802.64] P:1643.92 E:0.092383 |  I go over here am I going to take someone with me and create some space I think that's exactly what
[1802.64 - 1806.80] P:1706.50 E:0.089096 |  happened for Rodgery and he just went straight through the mid got right on the ball and curled it in
[1806.80 - 1812.80] P:1639.71 E:0.093955 |  still hung up on it Alfonso Davies dispossessed on the halfway line for Bayern Munich gets the
[1812.80 - 1817.52] P:1666.93 E:0.099155 |  interception in as Rodgery plays the ball back and it will be a throw to Manchester City so now
[1817.52 - 1822.24] P:1592.41 E:0.096044 |  it's John Stonestown to get an airfield from Pep Guardiola who's again out of his technical area
[1822.24 - 1827.04] P:1602.77 E:0.097709 |  the poor fourth official I mean he's not chasing it but he's got his arms outstretched and you can
[1827.04 - 1830.40] P:1707.69 E:0.100095 |  almost literally read it from here he's saying Pep come on he's getting the steps in isn't he
[1830.40 - 1834.24] P:1617.08 E:0.100390 |  exactly a couple of steps outside your technical area but Guardiola's halfway down the pitch
[1834.24 - 1839.76] P:1632.37 E:0.098755 |  he's down he's warming up he's warming up get off the pitch getting your technical area Gaffa
[1839.76 - 1844.72] P:1576.30 E:0.094084 |  what are you doing Gatley get a bit on as Bayern Munich play it down the left hand side Kingsley
[1844.72 - 1850.64] P:1604.95 E:0.087503 |  Coman will keep it in switching over to this left wing again Coman taking on Akangy Akangy gets
[1850.64 - 1856.32] P:1654.02 E:0.095244 |  a footing Coman will still retain possession for Bayern Munich who trail by Goltanil here on five
[1856.32 - 1863.04] P:1642.07 E:0.088295 |  live as Davies plays it back to Gretzger and now Delik closed down by Kevin De Bruyne now up
[1863.04 - 1867.28] P:1663.61 E:0.102878 |  in McCarno will play it out to the right hand side but it seems to center by Grealish skips
[1867.28 - 1872.32] P:1648.90 E:0.099346 |  past Ganabri like he wasn't there Grealish feeds Arland central position midway through the
[1872.32 - 1876.96] P:1671.09 E:0.102188 |  Bayern half goes down as found De Bruyne anyway ball ricochets inside the penalty area Grealish
[1876.96 - 1883.36] P:1627.98 E:0.099623 |  pulls it back and Bayern get the interception and will clear the ball but Manchester City all of a
[1883.36 - 1888.32] P:1756.83 E:0.090392 |  sudden yeah looking so dangerous just starting to click now Jack Grealish he's just beating his man
[1888.32 - 1894.48] P:1664.90 E:0.097493 |  with ease De Bruyne is getting on the ball Harlins now looking a little bit more lively and they're
[1894.48 - 1900.24] P:1812.17 E:0.095358 |  just taking control of the game itself Bayern are getting frustrated giving away silly free kicks as
[1900.24 - 1908.08] P:1727.83 E:0.089573 |  well yeah Bernardo Silva the latest to go down on the halfway line and Manchester City who lead by
[1908.08 - 1914.96] P:1615.62 E:0.090767 |  a Goltanil courtesy of that stunner from Rodgery just before the half hour will have this set
[1914.96 - 1923.60] P:1567.23 E:0.089557 |  pieces once again the rain and the wind whips around the Etihad swirling as if a fine mist but
[1923.60 - 1928.80] P:1518.44 E:0.088997 |  it's heavy out there challenging conditions as Akangy plays the ball over the top looking for
[1928.80 - 1933.28] P:1757.24 E:0.085874 |  the run of Gundawan it's just ahead of the Manchester City captain and three with Summit
[1933.28 - 1937.28] P:1974.22 E:0.099019 |  that was a lovely ball from Akangy and we know he's got that in his locker he loves a crossfield
[1937.28 - 1941.28] P:1919.08 E:0.091595 |  dyag we saw him attempted earlier and he got held up in the wind but this trajectory is nice and
[1941.28 - 1946.48] P:1905.37 E:0.088569 |  direct it's just a shame that you know Gundawan isn't the size of Arland and probably not as
[1946.48 - 1950.16] P:1872.63 E:0.095144 |  flexible either because Harlin probably would have taken on the outside of the right foot
[1951.28 - 1956.88] P:1531.46 E:0.088178 |  Chester down by Alfonso Davies pressure by Bernardo Silva and Bayern Munich will send it back to
[1957.44 - 1965.36] P:1484.19 E:0.097824 |  the tyres delicts out to the left hand side they go now with Guretska as Davies has an option
[1965.36 - 1972.48] P:1579.16 E:0.090315 |  Komen's gone in field Guretska uses Davies the Canada fallback taking on Akangy who again stands
[1972.48 - 1977.68] P:1643.95 E:0.085979 |  up well Guretska going to sit back forward to see Arlander edge of the penalty area but Manchester
[1977.68 - 1982.08] P:1635.33 E:0.106271 |  City marshalling well Kimmich's ball over the top though decent one looking for the run of Zane on
[1982.08 - 1987.44] P:1668.88 E:0.086154 |  that far side headed away by Ake and will be picked up by Grealish and field to Gundawan who
[1987.44 - 1992.00] P:1621.49 E:0.107141 |  sends it forward a lovely touch by De Bruyne to Harlin Manchester City really going through the
[1992.00 - 1999.36] P:1640.99 E:0.088798 |  gears now Harlin goes down advantage played by our referee Jesus Gilmanzano Grealish has it on the
[1999.36 - 2005.20] P:1578.68 E:0.089140 |  left hand side central now to Diaz over the halfway line now goes Akangy out to the right and Bernardo

[2032.56 - 2038.56] P:1699.34 E:0.103375 |  just get something on it brilliant save by Sommer the whistle's gone anyway goodness me
[2039.52 - 2044.08] P:1766.63 E:0.097294 |  what a fantastic stop by Jan Sommer now what's the referee given here initially I thought he
[2044.08 - 2049.68] P:1625.46 E:0.088853 |  might have given the free kick Manchester City have a player down the players are moving into
[2049.68 - 2054.08] P:1591.93 E:0.093566 |  the penalty area so it looks as though the corner might be given then there was no whistle if it
[2054.08 - 2059.92] P:1782.37 E:0.091422 |  is a corner this is a fantastic stop had the second attempt by Sommer huge reaction save as
[2059.92 - 2066.88] P:1598.21 E:0.097337 |  Gunduan follows in Sommer big lift but Karen that's outstanding what an amazing save from I'm sure
[2066.88 - 2072.08] P:1635.68 E:0.096110 |  what the statisticians are going to say in prone position so he's on the floor sticks a leg out
[2072.08 - 2077.04] P:1747.98 E:0.087794 |  and what an instinctual save but I think you know there were some questions around did Jan Sommer
[2077.04 - 2082.32] P:1798.50 E:0.089720 |  you know clip Jack Grealish who's running but to me it was a 50-50 so it is a corner the save needed
[2082.32 - 2088.00] P:1745.22 E:0.092953 |  making as Manchester City swing the ball in it's right across the six yard box still kept alive
[2088.08 - 2094.32] P:1718.62 E:0.091034 |  one quite fall in the area and by Munich do eventually get the ball away with Dias lurking
[2094.32 - 2098.72] P:1580.37 E:0.094470 |  here is Bernardo Silva right hand side dispossessed by Gnabry Dias will play it forward lovely bit
[2098.72 - 2104.00] P:1624.09 E:0.093902 |  of skill Bernardo Silva can only play it into Alfonso Davis Bynes struggling to clear their lines as
[2104.00 - 2110.00] P:1651.07 E:0.090465 |  they play up from the back but in the end it's very calmly done as the cross field ball over to the

[2121.68 - 2128.08] P:1653.59 E:0.087181 |  but by Munich still pressing out to the left hand side they go with Mussiala Manchester City leading
[2128.08 - 2133.44] P:1620.03 E:0.108462 |  by Goltaleal and it's the goal scorer Roger who does so well there challenges Mussiala plays the

[2263.60 - 2268.24] P:1617.31 E:0.088927 |  help so that means he's going to get a two-on-one that means we've got a spare City player Pernardo

[2312.00 - 2316.80] P:1701.11 E:0.086041 |  it was the little sort of the spot that the game needed they think the fans were happy with
[2316.80 - 2320.24] P:1748.04 E:0.093835 |  definitely the City players were happy with it at all and Bernardo silver he's got a little
[2320.24 - 2326.00] P:1669.71 E:0.091709 |  bit angry now and he's playing even better Manchester City not happy Pep Guardiola to

[2353.84 - 2358.80] P:1476.40 E:0.090633 |  the right now they have Sarnay the former Manchester City player but Acke has done this job very well
[2358.80 - 2363.68] P:1619.59 E:0.084505 |  indeed as they switch back out of possession to this back four with Acke on the right Acke on the
[2363.68 - 2370.00] P:1418.64 E:0.089119 |  left and stones and Diaz in the centre Manchester City here is a for McCona plays it forward to
[2370.00 - 2374.88] P:1514.34 E:0.084403 |  Sarnay lovely term from the former City man now to the left hand side he goes and Kingsley Coleman
[2374.88 - 2379.12] P:1481.56 E:0.088674 |  by looking to get back on level terms before the break in this Champions League called a final tie
[2379.12 - 2384.40] P:1742.63 E:0.083978 |  here is Sarnay 25 yards out good foot in by Roger E will come to Kimmich out to the right hand side
[2384.40 - 2389.52] P:1536.21 E:0.085343 |  he goes Pavar's ball in it's in front of every single red shirt in there but will be collected on
[2389.52 - 2397.44] P:1479.22 E:0.084923 |  this left hand side and Maciala played back to Delix who plays it forward into the area Coleman though
[2397.44 - 2403.68] P:1804.66 E:0.091239 |  is ushered out of the penalty area tries to get past Acanji great challenge by Acanji can see to
[2403.68 - 2407.20] P:1787.43 E:0.096070 |  the corner but he had to get that spot on there and he did yeah I mean they're just they're just
[2407.20 - 2411.60] P:1514.75 E:0.097456 |  probing now buying a little bit of spell spell edge of the box there plays a really nice football
[2411.60 - 2416.72] P:1565.17 E:0.092136 |  buying won't go away they'll keep playing their football goretzka's now actually making an impact
[2416.72 - 2421.60] P:1593.00 E:0.095430 |  in this game as well Coleman and Sarnay have switched so city have just got to be a get over
[2421.60 - 2428.72] P:1481.31 E:0.077191 |  the line till halftime at this scoreline five minutes to play in this first half one nil Manchester
[2428.72 - 2434.88] P:1560.03 E:0.084254 |  City lead by Munich with the corner which they're captain Kimmich will take Coleman's on the move
[2434.88 - 2439.36] P:1618.45 E:0.089232 |  inside the area as Kimmich plays it to the far post cleared away by Manchester City and see
[2439.36 - 2443.52] P:1602.62 E:0.094845 |  Arlow will pick it back up right hand side of the box down to the byline pulls the ball across
[2443.52 - 2448.72] P:1626.34 E:0.094935 |  it's met by Gunduan who clears away there's no sky blue shirt up there to alleviate some of the
[2448.72 - 2454.96] P:1460.35 E:0.088869 |  pressure they were all back defending by Munich will be forced back eventually to the halfway line
[2454.96 - 2464.40] P:1582.58 E:0.084555 |  where Davies goes back to young sommer so Delix has gone down here off the ball play has been
[2464.40 - 2469.04] P:1582.30 E:0.084601 |  stops by our referee by and we're in possession midway through their own half
[2470.80 - 2478.24] P:1454.43 E:0.081556 |  so it's a lick certainly not a player that by Munich would want to have any issues the Netherlands
[2478.24 - 2483.44] P:1500.10 E:0.091667 |  international now he's been so good in the run of form for the in the Bundesliga so far and he's
[2483.44 - 2488.24] P:1549.36 E:0.086799 |  been so consistent and I think he's not really put a foot wrong tonight so you know hopefully he's
[2488.24 - 2492.24] P:1698.05 E:0.082903 |  all right but something interesting I did notice I'm Deanna I don't know if maybe you've picked up
[2492.24 - 2496.96] P:1465.69 E:0.074157 |  on it but I think Sonny perhaps could release the ball a little bit quicker coming through the
[2496.96 - 2501.60] P:1620.78 E:0.087399 |  midfield I think you see obviously you mentioned Coman it switched flanks and he's been up against
[2501.60 - 2505.12] P:1502.90 E:0.091633 |  Akangia I think Akangia's got his number to be honest he's not been terribly effective but what
[2505.12 - 2509.20] P:1690.84 E:0.083996 |  has been interesting is he's coming off the back of Akangia going across the center back occupying
[2509.20 - 2513.68] P:1698.85 E:0.086008 |  that space between either Ruben Diaz and John Stones and trying to force a decision they pulled
[2513.68 - 2519.76] P:1617.61 E:0.085693 |  Akangia in to narrow up and that ball is is so available to to Davies out why but it's just so
[2519.84 - 2524.80] P:1742.94 E:0.090666 |  slow and getting there yeah he does he likes the ball at his feet he likes to see if he can take
[2524.80 - 2528.80] P:1660.64 E:0.100555 |  his opposite number on by that time though he's had two or three switches yeah the ball that was
[2528.80 - 2533.76] P:1693.27 E:0.093786 |  on it has gone and the opening has gone so yeah maybe that's something they'll look at but they are
[2533.76 - 2540.24] P:1635.58 E:0.085441 |  incredibly dangerous in possession they move it well their positions are all interchanging as well
[2540.24 - 2544.96] P:1508.12 E:0.096236 |  by and they're all over the place in regards they're set up they're organized but they know exactly
[2544.96 - 2549.60] P:1581.06 E:0.088119 |  what they're doing hard to mark it's a lot of fluidity yeah without a doubt well Delix is back
[2549.60 - 2554.40] P:1634.93 E:0.078669 |  up to his feet initially he's come over to the technical area and he's down again receiving
[2554.40 - 2559.20] P:1448.66 E:0.094329 |  more treatment as Byron get us back underway the ball is back with Jan Sommer manches the city one
[2559.92 - 2564.56] P:1630.09 E:0.091958 |  Byron Neal Rodri Stunner just before the half hour mark separates the sides
[2565.12 - 2569.36] P:1625.01 E:0.087981 |  Byron still in possession under pressure a little push there from the goal scorer Rodri on
[2569.36 - 2574.80] P:1570.31 E:0.090873 |  Maciala but sends it back to Epimacano and now Sommer who's closed down by the ball now tell you
[2574.80 - 2579.92] P:1703.89 E:0.079549 |  what again manches the city are going to feel that they can get joy out of closing Sommer down
[2579.92 - 2584.24] P:1632.10 E:0.095397 |  that time he did steer it back out to Epimacano he plays it forward won't be controlled by
[2584.24 - 2589.68] P:1678.76 E:0.089330 |  Gnabry and Gundawam will play it forward once more Delix is back on the field of play now having
[2589.68 - 2594.64] P:1619.84 E:0.083791 |  received that treatment so Byron back up to the full complement as we've been D-S comes across
[2594.64 - 2600.40] P:1546.87 E:0.083265 |  and clears away in the left back position momentarily moving out there to De Bruyne and now in
[2600.40 - 2605.68] P:1754.95 E:0.090415 |  field two Jack Grealish good pressure good hassling and harrying from Byron but Manches the city do
[2605.68 - 2611.36] P:1628.67 E:0.093607 |  with it well Manches the city who are in the unusual position if having had 10% less position
[2611.36 - 2618.00] P:1581.49 E:0.091879 |  than their opponents so far in this first half 45% for city 55% for Byron but sitting with the one
[2618.00 - 2621.84] P:1534.81 E:0.088658 |  goal advantage Byron have won it back though just inside the city half of Goretz go out to the left
[2621.84 - 2626.48] P:1662.74 E:0.080480 |  hand side they come now and Kingsley Coleman up against a Kange once more that's developing
[2626.48 - 2633.44] P:1640.04 E:0.096853 |  into a good battle Kange and Coleman with Sane currently taking on Ake on the other side as Delix
[2633.44 - 2639.12] P:1564.93 E:0.102819 |  goes down three kicks given and the 80 howl I think feels that Matias Delix made a rather a meal of
[2639.12 - 2643.28] P:1768.94 E:0.097835 |  that yeah yeah I'm gonna say a three course meal to be honest it was terrible he just jumped in the
[2643.28 - 2647.84] P:1694.09 E:0.098585 |  air Harlem is nowhere near him he knew he couldn't get hold of the ball and he just threw himself
[2647.84 - 2651.04] P:1643.76 E:0.089348 |  in the air embarrassing I saw some acting like that over a Christmas
[2652.56 - 2655.68] P:1620.44 E:0.091471 |  there's a jack in the beanstalk I've seen it at the Olympics on the high board
[2657.04 - 2661.76] P:1661.50 E:0.090140 |  yeah three course meal with after dinner mince as well and coffee to follow as Byron Munich have it
[2661.76 - 2666.16] P:1631.93 E:0.080439 |  just inside their own half all the way back to Janssen we're just going back to the issue that
[2666.16 - 2670.48] P:1650.45 E:0.090844 |  Delix had we did see a replay there was a little coming together between himself and Bernardo
[2670.48 - 2674.96] P:1679.91 E:0.080780 |  Silver nothing in it in terms of the penalty but just a little bit of contact on the the back of
[2675.36 - 2682.32] P:1732.26 E:0.083264 |  heel for Delix but he is back on he's fit enough certainly to get through till half time and Byron
[2682.32 - 2688.56] P:1555.46 E:0.077693 |  I'm sure will make a more in-depth assessment Byron who trail by Eagleton ill 30 seconds plus
[2688.56 - 2693.20] P:1524.46 E:0.087163 |  other time to play in this first half of this Champions League quarter final first leg here on
[2693.20 - 2697.20] P:1500.21 E:0.089693 |  Five Lively reminded we'll be hearing from our commentary team in Madrid he and Dennis and Chris
[2697.20 - 2703.28] P:1431.45 E:0.089251 |  Sutton ahead of our commentary of Real Madrid against Chelsea don't miss it tomorrow evening on Five
[2703.28 - 2708.72] P:1575.89 E:0.087711 |  Lively Kevin De Bruyne and the pressure almost gave the ball away but does enough to put enough
[2708.72 - 2714.00] P:1495.90 E:0.087687 |  venom on the pass to play it off Kingsley Coleman and Manchester City have a throw yeah it's it's
[2714.00 - 2720.16] P:1550.45 E:0.091745 |  it's amazing the way they play with silver wide right and jack wide left I mean they're literally
[2721.20 - 2724.40] P:1668.09 E:0.095122 |  on the on they couldn't get any further on the wings and it just makes the gaps in between the
[2724.40 - 2730.08] P:1528.50 E:0.084270 |  back four really really big for De Bruyne and Gunduan to get into I think that's really interesting
[2730.08 - 2734.88] P:1549.36 E:0.085898 |  sorry to dive in here but we've seen a lot of criticism from Edison early in the year about
[2734.88 - 2739.04] P:1845.98 E:0.088034 |  distribution and I just noticed there that I think they're just getting used to the way that jack is
[2739.04 - 2742.48] P:1783.11 E:0.089016 |  dropping down the line to try and get on the ball and I think Edison obviously expected him to be
[2742.48 - 2746.96] P:1619.90 E:0.087408 |  higher so that relationship obviously we've seen it grow over the course of the season but it's
[2746.96 - 2752.08] P:1630.71 E:0.083116 |  still not quite there is it Karen Pardsley and Dion Tufflin with us here on Five Live we're into
[2752.08 - 2757.12] P:1652.99 E:0.088865 |  two minutes of added time at the end of this first half Manchester City leading by Eagleton ill
[2757.12 - 2761.60] P:1572.38 E:0.081726 |  a candy under pressure from Coleman and Canabria as well so plays it back to Edison who takes the
[2761.60 - 2769.20] P:1569.19 E:0.082420 |  touch and plays it out to this right hand side and John Stones advancing past the red shirts almost
[2769.20 - 2775.36] P:1709.32 E:0.084498 |  of Jamal Masiale but in the end can't get past the youngster so goes back instead to the goalscorer
[2775.36 - 2780.32] P:1537.42 E:0.103425 |  Rodry over the halfway line he goes now plays it forward to De Bruyne who lays it on looking for
[2780.32 - 2785.36] P:1628.03 E:0.096220 |  the run of Gunduan De Bruyne almost picks it up inside the penalty area but sliding challenge
[2785.52 - 2790.56] P:1649.05 E:0.090729 |  will send it out to Leon Goretzka of Byron Munich and Byron's turn to come forward into the final
[2790.56 - 2795.52] P:1669.41 E:0.085682 |  minute of added time at the end of this first half can Byron fashion a chance as they look for a
[2795.52 - 2801.60] P:1755.08 E:0.088273 |  level error as Coleman plays the ball into the area headed away by Ake Goretzka won't reach it on
[2801.60 - 2807.68] P:1645.11 E:0.081063 |  that far side he does eventually get the foot in and Byron will come away with it with Pavar plays
[2807.68 - 2812.88] P:1711.91 E:0.095796 |  it in field two you're a Sarnay goes for goal all with us a fierce strike Edison might have had
[2812.88 - 2818.64] P:1756.75 E:0.085986 |  it covered it bounces just past that far post and a reminder of what the former Manchester City
[2818.64 - 2824.32] P:1787.03 E:0.086440 |  man can do absolutely I mean Sarnay is looking to really take this game by the scruff of the neck
[2824.32 - 2829.44] P:1560.08 E:0.078243 |  and if I'm being completely honest he looks like the only one that's feeling it but something
[2829.44 - 2834.00] P:1898.55 E:0.091080 |  interesting I noticed Vicki was when Kevin Bruyne was progressing the ball down at the other end
[2834.64 - 2839.52] P:1563.94 E:0.086216 |  this just speaks to how clever he is he was using the referee as a screen and I don't know if you
[2839.52 - 2845.36] P:1775.53 E:0.087800 |  guys noticed that but that just speaks to his mentality is intelligence about how he plays how
[2845.36 - 2852.80] P:1780.06 E:0.091283 |  he applies himself half time it still goes at the 80 hands and it is the goal from Rodry the stunner
[2852.80 - 2857.52] P:1717.43 E:0.098656 |  just before the half hour just outside the D killed it into the top corner that is the difference
[2857.52 - 2863.44] P:1686.34 E:0.098380 |  between the two sides and and Dion doubling alongside me it is a half that Manchester City have grown
[2863.44 - 2868.56] P:1574.67 E:0.095103 |  into yeah it is and you know I believe that Byron needed this half as well I think City were growing
[2868.56 - 2873.84] P:1718.92 E:0.095993 |  into the game getting better and better I'm seeing I'm seeing signs of City being a little bit
[2873.84 - 2880.16] P:1660.26 E:0.085752 |  fitter as well out of possession maybe a few of the Byron players don't like the pace at City player
[2880.16 - 2884.40] P:1701.06 E:0.085009 |  and they're finding it difficult to match but what a great game to watch what a great game to watch
[2884.40 - 2889.20] P:1745.76 E:0.083936 |  and Karen Tai still very much in the balance first leg still very much in the balance in terms of the
[2889.20 - 2895.76] P:1879.49 E:0.089836 |  school oh indeed I mean I think to touch on Dion your point around the fitness and I mean Muller
[2895.76 - 2899.20] P:2008.41 E:0.100524 |  in one of his pre-match interviews obviously alluded to the fact that he knew that it was going to
[2899.20 - 2904.32] P:1912.87 E:0.089331 |  be proper graph tonight obviously he's not involved in the starting 11 but I think the team knew that
[2904.32 - 2908.32] P:1911.60 E:0.089687 |  going into this game it was going to be a really really tough one but as soon as that goal went
[2908.32 - 2913.12] P:1841.64 E:0.078966 |  in I think for Manchester City by Rodry they grew in confidence by a few feet and they just
[2913.68 - 2918.56] P:1962.41 E:0.077866 |  really put their foot down didn't they it was the stunner he's first in the Champions League and
[2918.56 - 2923.76] P:1872.76 E:0.069985 |  it's the difference at the break half time at the Etihad Manchester City won by Munich Nill
[2923.76 - 2929.28] P:1936.85 E:0.090452 |  Vicki thank you very much as you say a fantastic goal from Rodry to separate the two sides that did
[2929.28 - 2934.56] P:1914.68 E:0.096640 |  kind of change the game Karen but there was also a little incident between Alfonso Davies and Bernardo
[2934.56 - 2941.12] P:1899.42 E:0.087154 |  Silva that that may just have sparked the City players and the City crowd into life yeah I absolutely
[2941.12 - 2945.84] P:2041.86 E:0.091018 |  think so I think you know he got a real shove in the back from Alonso Davies and I think he just
[2945.84 - 2951.76] P:1916.25 E:0.086047 |  went flying like a ragdoll off the pitch and I think everyone was fuming in the stadium on the pitch
[2951.76 - 2956.16] P:1806.80 E:0.088896 |  I mean Pep Guardiola was going berserk with a fourth official afterwards and you know I think
[2956.72 - 2962.00] P:1718.17 E:0.084833 |  you can tell that this is a team that made business because they were wildly offended I think by that
[2962.00 - 2966.48] P:1803.61 E:0.087291 |  and decided that they were really going to go for it and I think you know what I was impressed by the
[2966.48 - 2971.68] P:1939.09 E:0.073894 |  most was well yeah just as soon as that goal went in it just looked like they really really
[2971.68 - 2975.68] P:1779.55 E:0.087672 |  believed that they're going to take this game to to buy a Munich but look Thomas Tugels no slouch and
[2975.68 - 2979.52] P:1666.11 E:0.079295 |  I know he's going to come out with a few changes and a huge impact in the second half.
[2980.24 - 2984.40] P:1840.11 E:0.104678 |  Quite a few of you getting in touch on social media as well John says Byn will be disappointed to
[2984.40 - 2989.12] P:1851.11 E:0.094339 |  have conceded but looking at their bench they're prepared for this they have a plan B, C and D
[2989.12 - 2994.16] P:1826.16 E:0.094719 |  City can expect an onslaught in the last 30 minutes Nicholas though says while the attacking is
[2994.16 - 2999.76] P:1785.47 E:0.089909 |  otherworldly I've been so impressed with Man City's defence both as a team and one-on-one.
[2999.76 - 3004.16] P:1822.32 E:0.097727 |  We'll be back with our commentary team of Karen Barzyd on Dublin and Vicky Sparks very shortly

[3013.44 - 3018.80] P:1747.36 E:0.102484 |  Yeah half-time Kelly Benfica nil Inter Milan nil it's been an impressive start from Inter though
[3018.80 - 3024.72] P:1709.81 E:0.082307 |  they settled the quicker but the first chance Faltar Rafa Silva of Benfica was across from the
[3024.72 - 3031.12] P:1716.50 E:0.089289 |  left hand side and the inter headed clearance Faltar Rafa Silva was on the left hand side of
[3031.12 - 3037.28] P:1845.57 E:0.090304 |  the penalty area and he crashed his shot onto the chest of the Inter goalkeeper Anana Inter
[3037.28 - 3042.96] P:1865.60 E:0.088138 |  responded and they continue to surprise with some fluent and flowing football it's been a good half
[3042.96 - 3049.12] P:1856.25 E:0.078268 |  this Kelly it's been intriguing half-time Benfica nil Inter Milan nil. Sohel thank you very much

[3072.88 - 3077.60] P:1875.27 E:0.093918 |  free kick around 25 yards out just right of centre I think it's going to be a while till
[3077.60 - 3081.36] P:1798.79 E:0.093627 |  they take it so I'll let you know if they score from it but England better so far at the start of

[3328.16 - 3334.32] P:1830.23 E:0.072765 |  manage in the Champions League in two seasons and as a player is always the least special competition
[3334.88 - 3341.12] P:1554.14 E:0.076946 |  so to be here as a manager particularly when a week ago today even I didn't know I'll be here
[3341.12 - 3346.88] P:1697.24 E:0.071370 |  is a huge honour for me of course and was you know a big part of the my thought process of you know
[3346.88 - 3350.96] P:1681.65 E:0.071688 |  taking on the challenge here this is an amazing challenge for me personally as well as obviously
[3350.96 - 3355.52] P:1699.99 E:0.077670 |  for us as a as a team and a club I know I've managed in this competition before I know I've
[3355.52 - 3359.12] P:1667.57 E:0.071583 |  managed against big teams in this competition before so I'm not daunted at all in fact I'm
[3359.12 - 3365.84] P:1696.35 E:0.071683 |  more excited than anything um I'm a good favourites yes and I understand why because of the difficulties
[3365.84 - 3370.96] P:1657.98 E:0.070653 |  of our season and those things I don't think that's a problem I think those things are fine
[3371.44 - 3378.40] P:1504.39 E:0.069757 |  there's no better carrot in football than trying to prove people wrong of you know being underdog
[3378.40 - 3382.96] P:1386.65 E:0.065406 |  and never a good result I think it's one of the best things I've been part of that and on both
[3382.96 - 3387.52] P:1598.99 E:0.085378 |  sides actually so I think that's a nice challenge for us so I'm not worried about that and in terms
[3387.52 - 3391.76] P:1688.28 E:0.064758 |  of the pressure I'm not worried about that football at this level is pressure if you can't handle the
[3391.76 - 3396.24] P:1307.60 E:0.063982 |  pressure then you know you're not a big club or you're not a big player or participant in it

[3458.00 - 3463.60] P:1941.99 E:0.096396 |  bird of bay tomorrow night Frank Lampard almost in his press conference kind of drawing a line
[3463.60 - 3468.72] P:1916.19 E:0.088751 |  under the seasons so far saying I know Real Madrid are a favorite because I've had Chelsea's season
[3468.72 - 3473.20] P:2000.56 E:0.092888 |  has gone so far but he says that that's not a problem that's that's the situation we're in and
[3473.20 - 3479.04] P:1922.97 E:0.081822 |  that's what we'll deal with he also said that both teams are under pressure albeit for different
[3479.04 - 3486.40] P:1972.86 E:0.093956 |  reasons but he was also I think I think he's quite happy in the role of underdog it's quite clear he's
[3486.40 - 3490.72] P:1884.26 E:0.094617 |  got the biggest respect for for Carlo Lancholotti played under him of course at Stanford Bridge
[3490.72 - 3498.00] P:1930.66 E:0.090642 |  when Ligincook double um admires everything about the Real Madrid players in terms of the longevity
[3498.00 - 3502.08] P:1849.82 E:0.089769 |  and what they've achieved and the Champions League success that they've had on a consistent basis
[3503.20 - 3507.84] P:1855.48 E:0.091536 |  but also he was asked a number of questions about leadership and it was interesting that he talked
[3507.84 - 3513.76] P:1939.78 E:0.096028 |  at one stage where he said to be a leader you need to show in action just to show why you are he
[3513.76 - 3519.60] P:1983.63 E:0.091404 |  he believes that they've still got those those players who can perform but the the proof is in
[3519.60 - 3524.32] P:1933.02 E:0.089723 |  the pudding because at the minute despite all the money that Chelsea have thrown at these players
[3524.56 - 3531.52] P:1948.37 E:0.082086 |  to get them to Stanford Bridge they they might be a talented individuals but they are yet to
[3531.52 - 3537.12] P:1849.72 E:0.093949 |  show the collective spirit and despite Enzo Fernandez who also talked to Knight he said we're united
[3537.12 - 3542.80] P:1944.65 E:0.098086 |  as a group they yet to really show that. Chris on those leadership qualities and the and this spirit
[3542.80 - 3548.40] P:1948.15 E:0.090579 |  that's required within the group I wonder if the season that Chelsea have had so far plus a new
[3548.40 - 3553.68] P:1833.47 E:0.093102 |  manager coming in that takes a bit of the heat off them ahead of this game or if it ramps it up even
[3553.68 - 3561.84] P:1953.37 E:0.094826 |  further which way do you see it? I think the pressure is off because of the sacking of Potter
[3561.84 - 3566.08] P:1935.88 E:0.100440 |  and Frank Lampard coming in I mean this this team you look at the individuals within the
[3566.08 - 3573.68] P:2006.89 E:0.082612 |  Chelsea squad they are so so capable but because they have really underperformed in the Premier League
[3573.68 - 3578.64] P:1922.24 E:0.087859 |  I think that the expectation is off them and all the pressure is on around the grid let's get it right
[3578.64 - 3584.00] P:2006.45 E:0.086330 |  nobody expects Chelsea to win the Champions League but you know you look at the money which they've
[3584.00 - 3590.56] P:1983.26 E:0.087038 |  spent and if it all does click goal scoring has been their biggest problem but if it all does click
[3590.56 - 3595.52] P:1954.23 E:0.092255 |  then you know there's no reason why they can't beat Real Madrid over over two legs Real Madrid who
[3595.52 - 3602.56] P:1960.72 E:0.086250 |  were 13 points behind Barcelona in the Liga but we know that they always seem to find a way now
[3602.56 - 3607.92] P:1900.28 E:0.071091 |  you know Frank has to turn the tables and find a way for his Chelsea team to get through this tie
[3607.92 - 3612.16] P:1918.20 E:0.094342 |  and of course there are ties with Carlo Ancelotti who won a Premier League title with Chelsea
[3612.16 - 3617.12] P:1937.02 E:0.089421 |  he was asked whether he's sad to see Chelsea in their current state and if he'd return to help them
[3619.60 - 3629.04] P:1650.72 E:0.083420 |  again I'm sad yes I have a fantastic memory of this club of the people that are still working there
[3629.04 - 3636.16] P:1725.25 E:0.071766 |  and I am a supporter of Chelsea of course because I spent two years really nice there
[3636.64 - 3643.84] P:1681.25 E:0.063573 |  and be back no I think that Lampard I hope that Lampard is able to do a fantastic job with them
[3644.80 - 3650.96] P:1968.57 E:0.100800 |  that was Carlo Ancelotti Denne he's talking with a very relaxed demeanor as we know that Carlo
[3650.96 - 3656.72] P:2027.58 E:0.090260 |  Ancelotti has and this Real Madrid not just this this particular squad but Real Madrid throughout
[3656.72 - 3661.12] P:1995.95 E:0.097478 |  the years have shown that they are more than capable of dealing with the pressure of any big
[3661.20 - 3667.04] P:2061.93 E:0.090984 |  occasion it's not the occasion that's going to be the issue for them it's their form their 13 points
[3667.04 - 3672.96] P:1929.67 E:0.086144 |  behind Barcelona in the league yeah and I get the impression that he probably has to win the
[3672.96 - 3679.76] P:1883.12 E:0.089073 |  Champions League to keep his job do you think yeah I do and that is crazy to say that bearing in
[3679.76 - 3684.00] P:1866.80 E:0.088319 |  mind that obviously he won the Liga last year he won the Champions League last year they've won the
[3684.00 - 3689.76] P:1916.46 E:0.086924 |  club world cup they've won the the away for super cup but the fact is is that he's under pressure
[3689.76 - 3694.88] P:1932.70 E:0.090911 |  he's also been linked to Cali as well with the the national job in Brazil so we'll just have
[3694.88 - 3700.64] P:2042.08 E:0.091987 |  to wait and see where his future lies thank you very much for now Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton
[3700.64 - 3708.08] P:2015.68 E:0.076877 |  back to your dinner sounds delicious all right you don't need to say bye then can you not say that
[3708.08 - 3712.88] P:1779.90 E:0.093812 |  and can you not say that in Spanish Deno I actually said adios a stellar we go a star we go
[3713.04 - 3714.88] P:1992.97 E:0.071515 |  haha
[3715.36 - 3718.72] P:1957.77 E:0.113518 |  speak to you both later looking forward to listening to that tomorrow it's Real Madrid
[3719.28 - 3725.20] P:2001.23 E:0.100867 |  against Chelsea in the Champions League quarterfinal first leg up now though on five live sport is
[3725.20 - 3731.68] P:1992.98 E:0.097101 |  Manchester City against Bayern Munich City 1-0 up from the first half second half coming up with your
[3731.68 - 3738.40] P:1832.45 E:0.100094 |  commentary team of Karen Barthley Dion Dublin and Vicki Sparks thank you Kelly so both sets of players
[3738.40 - 3744.80] P:1501.69 E:0.083819 |  back out on the pitch here at the Etihad and the rain and the wind has lessened slightly
[3745.84 - 3752.24] P:1745.15 E:0.089192 |  so how will the conditions affect this second half it's a game where Manchester City deserve
[3752.24 - 3760.64] P:1839.42 E:0.085777 |  this one goal advantage beautiful goal by Roderick 20 yards out straight into the top corner past
[3760.64 - 3767.36] P:1767.25 E:0.081589 |  Jan Sommer but as we get underway for this second half do you think there'll be a change of approach
[3767.36 - 3772.56] P:1794.07 E:0.092073 |  Karen Barthley for Bayern Munich or will we see them pretty much do what they did in the first
[3772.56 - 3775.68] P:1705.87 E:0.095044 |  half as they look to get back on level terms you know I think they were getting a lot of joy
[3775.68 - 3780.40] P:1881.01 E:0.082159 |  especially down the the flanks you know I saw I'd imagine that we'll keep seeing that service in
[3780.40 - 3784.96] P:1965.90 E:0.095213 |  1v1's you know especially it was a Kanji and Coleman I think they were getting some joy down there as
[3784.96 - 3790.96] P:1745.39 E:0.082966 |  well to be fair a Kanji's dealt really really well with Coleman coming across but um yeah no I think
[3790.96 - 3795.84] P:1769.27 E:0.084740 |  there we'll see a lot more directness as well here's Gretzger winning the ball for Bayern Munich
[3796.40 - 3800.96] P:1705.30 E:0.092523 |  pays it out to the left hand side Bayern in their home kit the all reds Manchester City in the sky
[3800.96 - 3808.56] P:1776.72 E:0.088835 |  blue as the shot is driven in and saved by Edison Sane letting fly against his former sides
[3808.56 - 3812.80] P:1778.18 E:0.094425 |  Bayern starting this second half with intent trailing as they do by Goltan Hill and Sane
[3812.80 - 3819.84] P:1783.98 E:0.089820 |  Gnabrae turns inside the penalty area and Edison comes flying out and gathers but a real statement
[3819.84 - 3824.24] P:1775.95 E:0.100982 |  of intent Karen Barthley there from Bayern earlier it certainly wasn't I mean it's a direct ball but
[3824.24 - 3830.24] P:1871.77 E:0.089244 |  I mean wow what a strike from Sane I mean he hit that really really nice you know really unorthodox
[3830.24 - 3835.36] P:1822.72 E:0.089704 |  save from Edison he kind of bent down and stuck out like a really strong I think it was his left
[3835.36 - 3841.04] P:1644.16 E:0.079602 |  arm and just a parry it away but yeah still effective Manchester City with the ball inside
[3841.04 - 3845.84] P:1675.17 E:0.086278 |  their own penalty area no changes for either side at halftime so we'll take you through the line-ups
[3845.84 - 3850.40] P:1720.80 E:0.082467 |  in a moment that is Karen Barthley taking one for the team there is Dion Dublin was just finishing
[3850.40 - 3855.52] P:1665.04 E:0.089870 |  off his halftime pie thank you very much for that Vicki cheers you know what it's because I was
[3855.52 - 3859.84] P:1769.59 E:0.096581 |  wondering why you were gesturing so frantically to me and I realized you were always at a half
[3859.84 - 3866.64] P:1779.09 E:0.089834 |  pie in his mouth it was only a mini pie just a mini one I'm here for you Dion thanks Kaz always mate
[3867.20 - 3870.56] P:1681.15 E:0.084764 |  I'm back I'm back Vicki I'm back I'm back you're back you're back and to be fair you ceded the
[3870.56 - 3874.16] P:1686.65 E:0.090524 |  second comment because it was a goalkeeper comment so that's good team play from UD on
[3874.16 - 3878.96] P:1600.37 E:0.092400 |  Dublin thank you very much here on Five Live it's Bayern Munich in position trailing by the Goltan Hill
[3878.96 - 3884.88] P:1606.38 E:0.087855 |  over the halfway line they go by and playing from left to right in this second half Epimacano
[3884.88 - 3891.12] P:1640.27 E:0.084832 |  will send it all the way back to Jan Sommer who was closed down on a couple of occasions dangerously
[3891.12 - 3896.96] P:1686.74 E:0.081551 |  so by Manchester City in the first half without bare fruit for them in this second period Harland
[3896.96 - 3904.40] P:1704.46 E:0.092471 |  indeed almost converting on the goal line after charging down summer as Alio is brought down there by
[3904.64 - 3909.44] P:1775.19 E:0.085245 |  Bernardo Silva on the halfway line now it's a yellow card for Bernardo Silva and it's one of these
[3909.44 - 3914.00] P:1702.39 E:0.092390 |  where I wonder if our referee Jesus Manzano might have wished he'd let that play advantage
[3914.00 - 3918.00] P:1632.92 E:0.091701 |  because Missy Arlo had actually got past Bernardo Silva and was continuing to storm through the
[3918.00 - 3923.12] P:1655.17 E:0.085296 |  Manchester City off. Yeah, Missy Arlo was just striding away I mean Bernardo Silva just got over
[3923.12 - 3926.64] P:1709.96 E:0.088309 |  to Missy Arlo and just give him a bit of shake on the head is it to say sorry about that everybody
[3926.64 - 3931.20] P:1674.52 E:0.094899 |  had to take one for the team there he was away Missy Arlo and he had options as well so technical
[3932.00 - 3937.36] P:1731.83 E:0.069795 |  foul. So Bayern Munich in possession on the halfway line will take you through the line-ups
[3937.36 - 3941.60] P:1752.58 E:0.086131 |  when City are out of possession it's a four but when they're in possession it's a three so that
[3941.60 - 3947.04] P:1698.63 E:0.089563 |  is Edison in goal the back three of Ikanji Diaz and Ake is Bayern breaking towards the penalty area
[3947.04 - 3952.72] P:1800.31 E:0.098559 |  Saneke again good save by Edison and cleared away by Nathan Ake and Rodri will help it out to the
[3952.72 - 3958.08] P:1578.65 E:0.099193 |  right hand side where De Bruyne will pick it up he'll win the free kick as well that might be a
[3958.08 - 3966.48] P:1668.61 E:0.090837 |  yellow card as the referee goes to his pocket and indeed it is so yellow cards all square early on
[3967.04 - 3973.20] P:1658.65 E:0.080048 |  in this first half in the second half as I said the start of this second half Alfonso Davis going
[3973.20 - 3978.80] P:1525.00 E:0.089709 |  into the book for Bayern Munich but in terms of that city line-up completing the midfield then
[3978.80 - 3984.80] P:1431.67 E:0.089919 |  John Stones and Rodri ahead of them De Bruyne and Gunduan with Silva, Grealish and Harland up front
[3984.80 - 3990.08] P:1532.38 E:0.084620 |  to when City are out of possession Stones drops back into centre half and Ake comes out to the
[3990.08 - 3994.80] P:1551.16 E:0.095491 |  right hand side so free kick to Manchester City, Bayern with Sommer in goal the back four of Pava
[3994.80 - 4000.88] P:1698.01 E:0.073009 |  of Himmichano, Delict Davis, Gretzke, Misiala and Kimmich ahead of them Misiala sometimes
[4000.88 - 4006.00] P:1673.72 E:0.075132 |  pushing forward into the 10 as well with Coman, Sane the former City man and Gnabry the former
[4006.88 - 4012.00] P:1615.56 E:0.098361 |  Arsenal player up front as Bayern Dali, Jack Grealish charges the ball down, Sommer will he get there
[4012.00 - 4019.20] P:1677.62 E:0.097409 |  no he won't Grealish urged out of the penalty area, Gunduan cuts it across sloppy by Manchester City
[4019.20 - 4023.84] P:1628.75 E:0.101448 |  not dealing with the sloppiness Bayern Munich has Harland's epitome from Sommer's clearance,
[4023.84 - 4028.08] P:1590.96 E:0.099704 |  Grealish picks it up on the edge of the penalty area, he's just possessed by Kimmichle Coleman
[4028.08 - 4034.16] P:1699.76 E:0.100525 |  oh it was a comedy of errors there from both sides how Manchester City have not stuck that away as
[4034.16 - 4039.52] P:1713.14 E:0.093929 |  Grealish goes down throw to Bayern Munich City had to score the second there what on earth were
[4039.52 - 4045.20] P:1702.70 E:0.093248 |  Bayern doing in the penalty area just so sloppy up in Mekano there getting caught by Jack Grealish
[4045.20 - 4050.96] P:1665.62 E:0.088801 |  then it's a race between Sommer and Jack Grealish and he wins the race he puts into a dangerous
[4050.96 - 4057.12] P:1693.84 E:0.090118 |  area, Bayern don't clear keeper gets caught again shot by Harland is blocked there was a bit of a
[4057.12 - 4062.56] P:1679.96 E:0.085758 |  mess on both parts because City should have scored and Bayern should have cleared it real mess that
[4062.56 - 4068.80] P:1585.81 E:0.083163 |  was from both sides I'm thinking to myself Harland 15 yards out goal great defending though bodies on
[4068.80 - 4073.76] P:1841.89 E:0.097084 |  the line yeah it's a weird one it just goes to show you you know like what hesitate hesitancy can do
[4073.76 - 4079.28] P:1689.88 E:0.092383 |  to a side you know I don't know if I'm from Mekano didn't realize it that Jack Grealish was that close
[4079.28 - 4084.48] P:1642.57 E:0.091787 |  but yeah really really uncharacteristic mistake I think from Bayern Munich and boy are they lucky to
[4084.48 - 4089.60] P:1587.68 E:0.081002 |  get away with that well Grealish is still down receiving treatment but it's exactly what we said
[4089.60 - 4094.16] P:1615.28 E:0.088779 |  at the start of the second half but but usually it's Sommer in the first half that was closed down
[4094.16 - 4098.40] P:1767.18 E:0.091560 |  there it was the whole bind defend yeah they just they're just playing too slow they've got to know
[4098.40 - 4103.12] P:1739.87 E:0.088079 |  that City are not going to allow them that kind of that kind of space and time Jack Grealish it was
[4103.12 - 4109.52] P:1707.54 E:0.090417 |  on this occasion as soon as Jack went Harland went De Bruyne went silver went and they all went in
[4109.52 - 4113.92] P:1562.87 E:0.095934 |  behind Jack I'm glad he's up on his feet now Jack was down getting some treatment he's up on his
[4113.92 - 4120.24] P:1575.28 E:0.093511 |  feet he's walked off he's okay but they've got to be careful by not to play too slow yeah he's ready
[4120.24 - 4126.88] P:1432.43 E:0.091137 |  to come on Grealish and does come back on so goal is here in this Champions League called it's
[4126.88 - 4132.80] P:1359.29 E:0.099421 |  goalless Manchester City lead by Golden Hill in this Champions League called a final first leg here
[4132.80 - 4138.56] P:1352.04 E:0.092616 |  on five live as Bayern Munich have the ball just outside their own penalty area here is a Pemekana
[4138.56 - 4143.36] P:1534.38 E:0.101547 |  plays it forward it's a ball it's intercepted by the City goal scorer Rodri and now Harland
[4143.36 - 4147.52] P:1646.90 E:0.093292 |  playing the ball forward blocked by Kimmich who blocked that Harland effort a few moments ago
[4147.52 - 4152.64] P:1574.01 E:0.084920 |  inside the penalty area as Bayern Munich once again play their way out of trouble they're taking
[4152.64 - 4157.76] P:1600.20 E:0.095086 |  risk doing it but they are able to do it but it's that final ball as they get near the halfway line
[4157.76 - 4164.32] P:1494.04 E:0.080051 |  that is given away by a Pemekana and John Stones will pick it up and send it back to the Kange and
[4164.32 - 4169.04] P:1594.59 E:0.094262 |  now Diaz has been a goal in the other Champions League called a final Sahel Sahi and it's gone to
[4169.04 - 4174.88] P:1441.66 E:0.095806 |  the visitors into Malakviki they lead Benfica by Golden Hill a deep cross from the left hand side
[4174.88 - 4181.20] P:1417.41 E:0.094796 |  from Bustoni and Barela was gliding in at the far post and he's stuck it away a lovely header
[4181.28 - 4187.76] P:1422.26 E:0.083321 |  Benfica now into Milan one thanks Sahel Manchester City with the goal advantage
[4187.76 - 4193.12] P:1477.55 E:0.082655 |  here at the Etihad on five live eight minutes gone in this second half England's women still
[4193.12 - 4198.00] P:1509.02 E:0.093355 |  trailing Australia by a Golden Hill the long unbeaten run under Serena Begman they've never
[4198.00 - 4205.92] P:1468.33 E:0.085607 |  lost under her under threat all those out of play for a throw to Bayern Munich Karen Bosnick
[4205.92 - 4210.00] P:1730.49 E:0.096786 |  I love how clever Harland is he's just realized that up on Mekano has had an absolute stinker for
[4210.56 - 4215.04] P:1669.95 E:0.095723 |  two three minutes and he's gone and just targeted him he's just marking on him
[4215.84 - 4220.40] P:1509.37 E:0.090378 |  and here he comes now as the ball is intercepted well by Delict but excellent spot Karen that's
[4220.40 - 4224.32] P:1574.36 E:0.087881 |  exactly what Harland's doing and again it speaks to the intelligence of the runners
[4224.32 - 4229.04] P:1505.41 E:0.092261 |  Bayern Munich played over the top looking for the run of Gnabry headed away by Diaz it's a
[4229.04 - 4234.32] P:1588.52 E:0.095845 |  poor header though Gnabry latches onto it Stones is there to help out his centre half partner and
[4234.32 - 4239.04] P:1666.80 E:0.101052 |  Nathan Ake now up against Coman he picks it up for Bayern Munich and peels the ball and had a play
[4240.00 - 4245.44] P:1656.56 E:0.105556 |  official says no and Sane will drive and Edison beats the ball away well Sane's got a shooting
[4245.44 - 4250.96] P:1674.64 E:0.091561 |  boots on in this second half the former City man 20 yards out you'd expect Edison to make the save
[4250.96 - 4256.32] P:1688.42 E:0.096450 |  but it's still a good one it's a great strike as well Sane now on site 25 yards out on the
[4256.32 - 4261.76] P:1618.51 E:0.095423 |  angle anywhere at all he's striking the ball and he sort of strikes it from the bottom up so it bends
[4261.76 - 4266.24] P:1647.43 E:0.089402 |  and it and the keepers can't even see where it's going to go you can't have to gamble as a keeper
[4266.24 - 4271.60] P:1794.08 E:0.098338 |  surely oh Dion those are terrible obviously there's no kind of spin but there's so much movement
[4271.60 - 4277.60] P:1679.88 E:0.093509 |  and especially on a night like this with a soaking wet pitch and it's sorely wind about that ball
[4277.60 - 4282.00] P:1663.89 E:0.083877 |  can go anywhere Coman picks it up on this right hand side for Bayern Munich looking to get back on

[4286.88 - 4291.76] P:1685.36 E:0.101027 |  off Diaz tips it over the bar all that's one of those that could have looped over the Manchester
[4291.76 - 4296.08] P:1713.60 E:0.099729 |  City goalkeeper but he did well it's a buying corner you know Jack Grealish getting back and
[4296.08 - 4301.20] P:1503.42 E:0.094416 |  helping out his defenders well he got a massive high five from Diaz I mean it's a court he did
[4301.20 - 4305.36] P:1609.18 E:0.095947 |  give a corner away but the way that they defend together is absolutely fantastic there was a
[4305.36 - 4310.96] P:1591.92 E:0.087849 |  lovely bit of coming together between Coman and Grealish look out for that one yeah good spot
[4310.96 - 4316.16] P:1650.01 E:0.094660 |  D and it was Grealish that got the deflection as the ball is swung in brilliant header cleared away
[4316.16 - 4322.24] P:1722.53 E:0.096002 |  by Manchester City not once but twice goodness me what defending Diaz with the second clearance
[4322.24 - 4327.92] P:1738.21 E:0.096032 |  right off the goal line it's behind for another Bayern Munich corner two headers coming so close
[4327.92 - 4333.52] P:1504.43 E:0.094819 |  for the German side and it's great defending from Ackie great positional play in terms of
[4333.52 - 4339.76] P:1431.11 E:0.085935 |  his awareness of what's around him he's brave he gets his head on it so Bayern prepare to take

[4345.92 - 4351.28] P:1767.31 E:0.099066 |  this time backing by Kimmich flicks on and Edison should claim and does inside his six-yard box
[4352.16 - 4356.56] P:1522.89 E:0.106890 |  as the ball is cleared long by Edison and De Bruyne is on the chase and Sommer had to get that

[4438.32 - 4442.80] P:1773.00 E:0.100013 |  have gone across the keeper Kaz when when you're like that on the angle you've got to go across

[4451.60 - 4459.20] P:1442.58 E:0.086274 |  takes up off Ake but yeah that was poor from Ake so corner to Manchester City Kevin De Bruyne
[4459.20 - 4464.08] P:1653.60 E:0.091927 |  is over this plays it short to the edge of the penalty area Byron have switched off Grealish
[4464.08 - 4469.20] P:1752.29 E:0.099863 |  lays it off to Gundo and just outside the D back to De Bruyne now swings the ball in just down in
[4469.20 - 4477.92] P:1799.28 E:0.096875 |  the area what a save by summer absolutely outstanding from the Byron Munich goalkeeper
[4477.92 - 4483.28] P:1600.70 E:0.095336 |  Manchester City are inquiring as to whether there was a foul in there but the referee says no
[4483.28 - 4488.72] P:1760.62 E:0.097218 |  it will be a city corner Karen Bardley that's an outstanding start oh my goodness the goalkeepers
[4488.72 - 4493.76] P:1858.58 E:0.097428 |  I'm absolutely loving this second half already you know we're seeing an Edison counterattack into
[4493.76 - 4498.48] P:1690.43 E:0.098000 |  a summer header you know we're seeing fantastic saves over the crossbar but I mean how about
[4498.48 - 4504.24] P:1640.93 E:0.097209 |  Bernardo Silva bringing that down to his chest what composure six yards off from goals fantastic
[4504.88 - 4512.32] P:1727.30 E:0.089892 |  out to the right hand side this corner will be taken swung to the far post by another player down
[4512.32 - 4518.08] P:1637.64 E:0.084050 |  and the referee has spotted it as stone since the ball across goal and it will be a free kick
[4518.08 - 4522.64] P:1737.58 E:0.092553 |  to Byron Munich inside the round penalty area well Deion what a start to this second half
[4522.64 - 4527.20] P:1668.32 E:0.101988 |  it could be two two it could be three two yeah it could be both sides are completely going for
[4527.20 - 4532.24] P:1591.44 E:0.100730 |  this they really are Kimmich went down just there but the referee's just saying that you injured or
[4532.24 - 4537.20] P:1593.95 E:0.096058 |  you know he's up on his feet and they're moving again but Byron know that if they switch off any
[4537.20 - 4542.00] P:1583.89 E:0.082653 |  more City of Ferry so many players forward into the box that they will score again and they've
[4542.00 - 4545.60] P:1629.09 E:0.095948 |  been very very positive everything's going through the centre of the pitch at the moment through
[4545.60 - 4552.56] P:1662.74 E:0.076715 |  De Boerner Harlan and again the pressure being put on Jan Sommer the Byron goalkeeper that time
[4552.56 - 4558.80] P:1597.25 E:0.087782 |  by Grealish the clearance is out of play and Akkanji will take this throw for Manchester City
[4558.80 - 4564.80] P:1620.63 E:0.099395 |  City who are unbeaten in their last 24 Champions League home games you have to go
[4565.68 - 4571.28] P:1544.52 E:0.094187 |  all the way back to the loss against Leon in September 2018 they lead by a goal to kneel here
[4571.28 - 4576.40] P:1492.52 E:0.093752 |  if they avoid defeat they'll set a new English club record of 25 Champions League home games
[4576.96 - 4582.00] P:1558.67 E:0.104464 |  and beaten in a row is Byron Munich again with Sarno to the edge of the area Eddison comes out very
[4582.00 - 4587.68] P:1588.45 E:0.083824 |  quickly and clears away Delix will send it back to Sommer but Deion and Karen you both said in the
[4587.84 - 4593.04] P:1561.22 E:0.087911 |  first half Sarno is looking like the player who can haul Byron back into this time yeah I think
[4593.04 - 4598.88] P:1601.12 E:0.092973 |  his left foot at the moment is absolutely on fire he's striking the ball so well and you can't
[4598.88 - 4603.12] P:1782.68 E:0.094135 |  give him any time at all and in and around the City's box he hit the target he has done three
[4603.12 - 4608.64] P:1607.01 E:0.085529 |  times already and Eddison's been equal to it here goes Gundawan down the left hand side nice little
[4608.64 - 4614.96] P:1621.99 E:0.083309 |  back heel to find Jack Grealish from Manchester City who goes all the way back to Nathan Ake square
[4615.04 - 4621.12] P:1457.95 E:0.088959 |  now to Ruben Diaz and now the goal scorer Rodgerie knew that he was being closed down by
[4621.12 - 4626.08] P:1450.24 E:0.089476 |  Missy Arles so goes back to Ake and now Diaz wants more as Manchester City slot into that back three
[4626.08 - 4632.88] P:1452.08 E:0.095552 |  here is Harland looking to score his 45th goal of the season City working out to the right hand side
[4632.88 - 4639.36] P:1408.48 E:0.090715 |  here is Bernardo Silva has the options in the box Harland is one of them in that central position
[4639.36 - 4643.84] P:1482.38 E:0.109552 |  but Bernardo Silva has two by players with him and he gets past them both brilliantly into the
[4643.84 - 4649.52] P:1563.03 E:0.093957 |  penalty area he goes in the end Davies recovers well down by the buy line but Silva's won it back
[4649.52 - 4654.72] P:1569.87 E:0.100427 |  just inside the area tries to pull it back the shot is driven across goal they're appealing for the
[4654.72 - 4661.68] P:1602.17 E:0.095767 |  corner it's gone the other way and in the end the referee changes his mind so it will be a throw
[4661.68 - 4665.68] P:1509.04 E:0.089426 |  to Manchester City just bounced off the corner flag so did go out for a throw initially it was
[4665.68 - 4671.60] P:1406.90 E:0.095560 |  given to Bayern but it's much too Benjamin Pavel's disappointment it will be a throw to Manchester
[4671.60 - 4676.24] P:1393.98 E:0.096789 |  City and Jack Grealish is being told by the referee to take it right down by the corner
[4676.24 - 4680.32] P:1423.94 E:0.106646 |  flag where it did bounce out but again lovely move from City yeah Bernardo Silva down the right
[4680.32 - 4685.52] P:1515.29 E:0.090293 |  hand side I mean he's got Davies who's bigger than him his Gretzka came over to to double up on
[4685.52 - 4690.88] P:1630.26 E:0.087965 |  Silva but he's that clever his body language is left and then it's right and they just can't deal
[4690.88 - 4695.04] P:1594.47 E:0.084870 |  with his movement he gets by two players City have squandered the throw but one possession
[4695.04 - 4700.24] P:1581.03 E:0.100312 |  back Harland on the edge of the area Bayern get the foot in sliding in his Grealish Rodgerie now to
[4700.32 - 4707.20] P:1584.64 E:0.086415 |  De Bruyne great vision looking for Bernardo Silva but well read by Davies and Davies will bring it
[4707.20 - 4712.72] P:1581.79 E:0.100799 |  away the Canada football back had his disc possessed by De Bruyne and now here comes Bernardo Silva
[4712.72 - 4717.84] P:1563.03 E:0.083747 |  back to De Bruyne plays it in early looking for Harland cleared away by Epermikano, Acangio will
[4717.84 - 4722.80] P:1598.57 E:0.088938 |  win the head of Manchester City sent it out to the right hand side and De Bruyne exchanges passes
[4722.80 - 4728.08] P:1568.89 E:0.092312 |  with the goal scorer Rodgerie and now Acangio under pressure goes all the way back to Diaz who will
[4728.80 - 4734.32] P:1591.12 E:0.096471 |  send it all the way back to his goalkeeper Edison yeah you know we sometimes describe players as
[4734.96 - 4739.44] P:1667.43 E:0.101593 |  I've got a great engine I think Kevin De Bruyne has got two engines I just don't know how he gets
[4739.44 - 4744.00] P:1567.11 E:0.093795 |  around the pitch so quickly so smoothly and so effectively every time he gets the ball here he
[4744.00 - 4748.72] P:1587.81 E:0.092565 |  is again slides the ball to Harland in the penalty area forced to the right hand side of the box
[4748.72 - 4753.28] P:1529.40 E:0.091733 |  pulls it back to Rodgerie looking for the run of Grealish on the left hand side cleared away by
[4753.28 - 4758.80] P:1599.30 E:0.087590 |  Pavar almost falls to Acke Grealish then gets involved and wins it back for Manchester City who
[4758.80 - 4765.04] P:1618.14 E:0.103451 |  lead here on five lies by a goal to nil 16 minutes gone in this second half here is Rodgerie who
[4765.04 - 4770.64] P:1499.19 E:0.092394 |  scored that goal a stunner just outside the D top corner just before the half hour mark out to the
[4770.64 - 4776.16] P:1415.28 E:0.100465 |  right hand side now and Bernardo Silva finds De Bruyne back to Bernardo Silva hugging that right
[4776.16 - 4781.12] P:1484.84 E:0.086101 |  hand touch line all the way back to Acangio and feels to Rodgerie now but this is where
[4781.12 - 4786.40] P:1446.40 E:0.105338 |  Karen Manchester City just settled into their rhythm and it's exhausting for five yeah it really
[4786.40 - 4792.16] P:1574.19 E:0.104021 |  is you can see the overloads happening particularly on City's right hand side in a stone John Stonest
[4792.16 - 4796.24] P:1555.36 E:0.101617 |  has taken a really advanced position through the midfield but now he's coming across a big shift
[4796.24 - 4801.36] P:1700.32 E:0.094633 |  from him to go and connect play to try and build up with Grealish and Acke and Ruben Diaz but yeah
[4801.36 - 4804.88] P:1800.75 E:0.093384 |  you're absolutely right Vicki they're just probing and probing and trying to find that weakness that
[4804.88 - 4810.48] P:1572.68 E:0.082428 |  moment when Byron Munich just switch off to attack and here they come again down the right hand side
[4810.48 - 4816.64] P:1518.41 E:0.084692 |  as the rain begins to team down once more in Manchester Bernardo Silva lays it off to
[4816.64 - 4821.20] P:1499.11 E:0.095254 |  Kevin De Bruyne Rodgerie's making the run here he is Rodgerie just outside the area well intercepted
[4821.92 - 4827.28] P:1571.43 E:0.086075 |  by Gretzger for Byron and now forward to Kingsley Coman he's over the halfway line Stones is there
[4827.28 - 4834.00] P:1651.38 E:0.090109 |  with him Coman goes out to the left hand side and Sane who's stung the palms of Edison a few times
[4834.08 - 4840.16] P:1658.43 E:0.087290 |  in this second half now Masiala lays it off as Kimmich will have a drive blocked away by Diaz
[4840.16 - 4845.84] P:1506.85 E:0.086378 |  just inside the area just a down by De Bruyne and now picked up by Grealish plays about to Acke
[4845.84 - 4850.48] P:1582.49 E:0.090820 |  who thinks it very cutely out to this left outside that's brilliantly done by De Bruyne keeps it in
[4850.48 - 4856.16] P:1519.22 E:0.088582 |  can't quite find Grealish and Kimmich has it once more to Gretzger and Byron go all the way back
[4856.16 - 4862.48] P:1706.61 E:0.090670 |  into their own half now Kevin De Bruyne is down off the pitch so play continues
[4863.52 - 4868.48] P:1574.65 E:0.094646 |  Manchester City medical staff are already over to the Belgium now the ball goes out of play there's
[4868.48 - 4872.80] P:1504.20 E:0.091969 |  no reason here for the referee to stop play because De Bruyne is off the pitch but this will be a
[4872.80 - 4878.16] P:1577.18 E:0.093874 |  concern Deom yeah it will be and I mean I've been saying this for a long time I didn't see the way
[4878.48 - 4886.24] P:1555.65 E:0.084403 |  he fell but I'm pretty much guarantee that oh it's his knee it's his knees his studs get caught in
[4886.24 - 4893.28] P:1789.81 E:0.092614 |  the ground his groin opens up his knee opens up really awkward fall his left leg sliding off the
[4893.28 - 4899.60] P:1904.85 E:0.091941 |  pitch his right leg is on the pitch his studs are caught in the ground but like the machine he is
[4899.60 - 4905.60] P:1660.75 E:0.099655 |  is up on his feet again yeah he is he's been helped up to his feet City want Byron to put the ball
[4905.60 - 4910.40] P:1736.31 E:0.106105 |  out but there's no real reason to do so you have to say from Byron's perspective De Bruyne wants to
[4910.40 - 4916.48] P:1797.32 E:0.101069 |  come back on there's no stopper in play yet Guardiola is down on his knees in this technical
[4916.48 - 4922.24] P:1679.72 E:0.088935 |  area watching on because Byron are looking to take advantage with City temporarily down to 10 players
[4922.24 - 4927.36] P:1523.45 E:0.089508 |  now De Bruyne is weighed back on so they're back up to the full complement and Byron Munich have it
[4927.36 - 4932.48] P:1484.05 E:0.096702 |  over on the left hand side Manchester City lead by Goltin and then Guardiola's got up off his knees
[4932.56 - 4938.32] P:1397.69 E:0.094296 |  standing with his hands on his hips Byron Munich in possession on the half-way line
[4938.88 - 4945.92] P:1444.49 E:0.091663 |  lovely turn by Missy Arla plays it forwards will be chased by Alfonso Davies but he won't be able
[4945.92 - 4951.52] P:1579.33 E:0.088859 |  to keep it in did it get a little deflection on the way through Well Byron certainly feel it did
[4951.52 - 4956.80] P:1639.26 E:0.095204 |  Manchester City are asking the question but it will be the corner kick to Byron Munich right in front
[4956.80 - 4962.96] P:1698.03 E:0.088384 |  of that little away contingent there across all three tiers that little section the red banners
[4962.96 - 4969.60] P:1771.31 E:0.080647 |  and shirts in there looking as their side look to get back on level terms corner swung high to the

[5077.28 - 5081.92] P:1395.29 E:0.094485 |  I wouldn't have thought so he's been down a couple of times and he looked like he's hurt but he's

[5106.40 - 5111.44] P:1688.15 E:0.104221 |  off he goes Hylian Alvarez is on yeah and you know what I think the manager is absolutely spot on
[5112.08 - 5117.36] P:1749.52 E:0.102738 |  he's had a few niggles he's fell in a certain way he's absolutely livid Kevin De Bruyne is not happy

[5122.24 - 5128.80] P:1680.66 E:0.085614 |  just protecting the best player that he has but De Bruyne is not happy at all yes interesting how
[5128.80 - 5134.00] P:1698.29 E:0.091897 |  do you read that Karen because is that frustration at Guardiola is that frustration at the situation
[5134.72 - 5138.80] P:1697.34 E:0.097894 |  I think it's probably the situation because I probably feel like he was just kind of getting
[5138.80 - 5142.80] P:1696.54 E:0.096228 |  into his groove a little bit especially in the first half I think he had those really really
[5142.80 - 5147.92] P:1544.57 E:0.087035 |  great moments and I think he was hoping for a few more he hasn't been involved as involved
[5148.64 - 5152.64] P:1641.74 E:0.088175 |  as much as I think he would have liked so far in the second half so yeah ultimately I think he's
[5152.64 - 5157.52] P:1572.36 E:0.092812 |  just frustrated with the situation on the whole here comes the pomecano for Byn Munich
[5157.52 - 5161.44] P:1517.81 E:0.094327 |  cleared away by Manchester City but Goretzka will pick it up and send it out to the right hand side

[5167.44 - 5175.76] P:1501.11 E:0.089680 |  closer with his Benjamin Pavar there on the edge of the six-yard box as Byn Munich prepare to make a
[5175.76 - 5181.04] P:1565.03 E:0.097872 |  change and it is Sadio Mane who gets a big double hand on the shoulders from Thomas Tuchel
[5181.04 - 5189.60] P:1521.65 E:0.095939 |  as he prefers to come on to replace Jamal Zila yeah it's uh yeah danger Sadio Mane danger now he
[5189.60 - 5194.56] P:1822.04 E:0.085104 |  is a man that will put himself in gold scoring positions and he'll be able to score you know
[5194.56 - 5198.72] P:1737.57 E:0.099195 |  something out of nothing he's that kind of player we've seen him we've seen him firsthand in the

[5205.12 - 5210.24] P:1612.30 E:0.082685 |  is going to be a joy down the right sonny down the left so work harder I think the key is
[5210.88 - 5215.84] P:1544.83 E:0.089033 |  Delet wins the header at the back for Byn just outside the penalty area yes he has 11 goals

[5226.96 - 5232.16] P:1631.80 E:0.110523 |  back of the net back here from Queen List beautiful Harland into the penalty area pulls the ball across
[5232.24 - 5239.12] P:1645.29 E:0.114437 |  there is the header from Bernardo Silva and there is the second goal for Manchester City
[5239.12 - 5246.96] P:1646.72 E:0.109032 |  they slice by Munich apart and take a grip on this Champions League quarterfinal two City 2 by
[5246.96 - 5252.00] P:1737.15 E:0.112546 |  Munich Nils what are they doing in defense I think he was up in the corner again trying to play out
[5252.00 - 5257.92] P:1717.69 E:0.102183 |  wanted too much time on the ball it was Jack Gleelish again that put him under pressure you've
[5257.92 - 5263.76] P:1644.71 E:0.111327 |  got to learn your lesson Jack Gleelish nicked it off him back here into Harland I'm thinking Harland
[5263.76 - 5270.72] P:1665.77 E:0.106969 |  has got to shoot no he doesn't he just lifts it over to the far post I'm thinking who's there Bernardo
[5270.72 - 5277.76] P:1596.13 E:0.106403 |  Silva comes from nowhere a bullet header right past the keeper keepers got no chance even with a
[5277.76 - 5284.24] P:1558.04 E:0.102247 |  header from Silva keepers got no chance great vision great hard work great brilliant goal by City
[5284.88 - 5291.68] P:1549.24 E:0.089500 |  I love the fact that there was a little back heel as well and I think that was was that from
[5291.68 - 5298.48] P:1627.60 E:0.092744 |  Jack no was that from Jack Gleelish yeah it was and just the awareness of Harland to understand
[5298.48 - 5304.24] P:1564.32 E:0.106560 |  that there was just a little dink pass and the header from Bernardo Silva was just phenomenal what
[5304.24 - 5313.52] P:1503.68 E:0.099066 |  a low driven header who needs Kevin De Bruyne with a sis like that beautiful from Harland's
[5314.88 - 5321.44] P:1510.73 E:0.112614 |  clinical from Bernardo Silva so much power generated on that header and Manchester City
[5321.44 - 5326.24] P:1450.64 E:0.102180 |  lead by Munich by two goals to nil midway through this second half
[5328.24 - 5335.36] P:1546.77 E:0.092803 |  Pep Guardiola out of his technical area wants more but both sides do and have had chances
[5336.00 - 5342.08] P:1582.19 E:0.095206 |  in this second half but a key a key second goal for Manchester City as Sommer has it on the edge
[5342.08 - 5348.32] P:1527.87 E:0.107695 |  of his own six yeah I think it's just that ruthless edge that City have when they get a chance they
[5348.32 - 5352.88] P:1531.09 E:0.113981 |  do try to make sure they put it on the back of the net they've given the ball away again
[5352.88 - 5358.72] P:1432.49 E:0.101935 |  Apamecano really struggling comes to Gundel an into the penalty area goes for the one two
[5358.72 - 5363.36] P:1603.81 E:0.100907 |  Apamecano gets the foot in Gleelish now will curl it to the backstick Silva's there again
[5363.36 - 5369.52] P:1595.71 E:0.108520 |  good header by Davies but by Munich are rocking at the moment and Apamecano's confidence is absolutely
[5369.60 - 5374.64] P:1755.51 E:0.098653 |  shocked yeah he's shot and all the City players seem to be wanting to find Silva in the air now
[5374.64 - 5378.80] P:1650.30 E:0.088601 |  that's how good he's doing Jack Gleel is trying to find him at the far post good defending
[5378.80 - 5385.92] P:1577.61 E:0.090784 |  but City are really really going for the throat now corner out swinging an owl this time they
[5385.92 - 5392.32] P:1498.53 E:0.097303 |  lead two nil Manchester City can they find the third Harland is in there making their onto the
[5392.32 - 5397.36] P:1626.87 E:0.094027 |  near post as the corner is swung high it's headed away by Bayern Munich comes out to Jack Gleelish
[5397.36 - 5402.56] P:1684.85 E:0.094597 |  left hand side of the penalty area who steers it back to Gundel an and now Bernardo Silva just
[5402.56 - 5408.56] P:1581.83 E:0.088430 |  inside the Bayern half Silva who's got the second goal in the second half for Manchester City as
[5408.56 - 5414.16] P:1611.09 E:0.098516 |  the ball is swung in high comes almost all the way through will be controlled by Diaz who just had
[5414.16 - 5418.88] P:1638.24 E:0.094143 |  to keep it in on the bar line pulls it back and somewhere will claim indeed Diaz wasn't able to
[5418.88 - 5424.80] P:1524.74 E:0.091376 |  keep it in and it will be a goal kick to Bayern Munich who are reeling at the moment defensively
[5424.80 - 5428.88] P:1505.52 E:0.094736 |  they had the best defense in the Champions League coming into this match you can see the just two
[5428.88 - 5435.20] P:1472.48 E:0.100101 |  goals in the entire competition they conceded two goals here at the Etihad here on five live after
[5435.20 - 5439.36] P:1473.79 E:0.096231 |  that second goal went in incidentally there were some scuffles in the crowd over in the
[5439.36 - 5445.60] P:1630.40 E:0.097104 |  Bayern Munich ends some of the Manchester City fans as the header is all the way back by Rodgerie
[5445.60 - 5452.16] P:1771.12 E:0.102843 |  from outside his own penalty area to Edison Karen Barton I love to see it I love when a team is on
[5452.16 - 5457.36] P:1626.20 E:0.089353 |  the exact same page you know exactly what needs to happen Rodgerie is tracking back obviously a
[5457.36 - 5461.28] P:1676.36 E:0.104544 |  ball in the air comes to when he knows look I'm just going to head this back to Eddie he's going to be ready
[5462.88 - 5469.36] P:1442.87 E:0.098237 |  so Edison inside his own penalty area as Manchester City play around the Bayern Munich press so in
[5469.36 - 5475.92] P:1435.81 E:0.088272 |  terms of the formation for Bayern Gennabry had slotted in just behind Sadio Mane so he got
[5475.92 - 5483.20] P:1449.74 E:0.087102 |  Coman on the right Sani on the left as Edison wants more takes the ball inside his own penalty
[5483.20 - 5488.72] P:1513.84 E:0.094786 |  area and Manchester City working out to the right hand side in the Kanji he plays the ball off
[5488.72 - 5495.12] P:1546.65 E:0.087364 |  Leroy Sani and it will be a throw to Manchester City midway through their own half Thomas Tickle
[5495.12 - 5503.36] P:1481.98 E:0.094007 |  stands arms folded on the edge of his technical area what does he do now see on he's such an
[5503.36 - 5508.88] P:1364.26 E:0.096968 |  experienced manager Champions League winner of course getting the better of Pep Guardiola with
[5508.88 - 5513.76] P:1551.09 E:0.091605 |  Chelsea two years ago in the final house he get back into this tie against me I mean he can't
[5514.32 - 5518.24] P:1599.99 E:0.096436 |  he can't rush into anything he's got to have to have to pick the right place to come I think Sadio
[5518.24 - 5522.40] P:1522.07 E:0.093595 |  Mane is definitely one that he has to get on the pitch I'm sure that Mulder will find his way on
[5522.40 - 5528.24] P:1583.96 E:0.088062 |  the pitch at some stage to try and settle things down but they just have to move the ball quicker
[5528.32 - 5533.44] P:1685.30 E:0.087689 |  by and they're so slow at the back moving the ball they play right into City's hands
[5533.44 - 5537.92] P:1610.02 E:0.089707 |  and they're coming over the halfway line Manchester City with Nathan Ake out to the left hand side
[5537.92 - 5543.28] P:1589.96 E:0.089709 |  and Jack Grealish City leading by two goals to nil here on five live Grealish left hand side of the
[5543.28 - 5548.56] P:1524.57 E:0.098067 |  penalty area laid off now by Rodry who got things underway in the first half Gundawan to Grealish
[5548.56 - 5553.36] P:1469.83 E:0.095364 |  edge of the box plays it in Harland still edge of the penalty area tries to find Alvarez just
[5553.36 - 5558.48] P:1527.17 E:0.102228 |  loses control play continues Gundawan left hand side of the six-shot box pulls it back Alvarez
[5558.48 - 5563.76] P:1549.73 E:0.102858 |  trying to pick his spot Summer makes the save cleared away by Alfonso Davis by and we're asking the
[5563.76 - 5569.04] P:1666.82 E:0.097742 |  question could that have been a free kick in there we played on it's out of play for a Manchester
[5569.04 - 5574.32] P:1738.73 E:0.102232 |  City throw and again what a huge opportunity to get another goal for Manchester City Summer has
[5574.32 - 5580.72] P:1720.86 E:0.092008 |  been absolutely outstanding tonight he does so so well to change direction and get set as quickly
[5580.72 - 5585.84] P:1610.85 E:0.103549 |  as possible and then he takes a leg out to his left and just gets a hand as quickly as he can as
[5585.84 - 5590.72] P:1687.51 E:0.096634 |  fast as he can down to make that save and to parry it into a safe area that's nestling in the back
[5590.72 - 5596.08] P:1582.04 E:0.098046 |  of the net it's a great effort from Alvarez he's just passing it into the corner from eight yards out
[5596.08 - 5600.96] P:1627.58 E:0.105995 |  Summer just shifts his feet from underneath him and just palms it into a safe area what to say
[5602.40 - 5607.76] P:1599.58 E:0.097299 |  corner to Manchester City they lead two nil headed away by Delict who beats Harland to the ball
[5607.76 - 5613.52] P:1696.62 E:0.085533 |  here is Bernardo Silva back out to the right hand side he goes as Manchester City look to keep up
[5613.52 - 5620.40] P:1599.89 E:0.112528 |  the pressure Stones is in their heads across Harland and that is what he does so well the
[5620.40 - 5627.84] P:1544.48 E:0.113558 |  predatory finish on the angle from close range and Erling Harland makes it three nil to Manchester
[5627.84 - 5636.80] P:1565.91 E:0.111175 |  City against fine Munich 45 goals for the season the most that any Premier League player has scored
[5636.88 - 5644.56] P:1513.18 E:0.110087 |  across all competitions in a single campaign this man is quite simply the best in the world at this
[5644.56 - 5650.80] P:1469.73 E:0.108942 |  moment Manchester City three by Munich nil it was only a matter of time when is he gonna crop up
[5650.80 - 5656.88] P:1581.66 E:0.100493 |  he's done so much work for the players tonight Harland he's set players he's crossed the ball
[5656.88 - 5662.72] P:1574.99 E:0.108693 |  for Silva he's got himself on the score sheet as well the fans love him it's a little tapping at
[5662.72 - 5669.44] P:1643.25 E:0.097718 |  the bar post little right foot volley from four yards on the angle summer comes out but he puts
[5669.44 - 5674.16] P:1625.63 E:0.102570 |  it across him keepers got no chance I think it might be stones that heads the ball down
[5674.88 - 5680.16] P:1558.89 E:0.100333 |  that was a brilliant goal a great team goal and he was never going to be off the score sheet when
[5680.16 - 5685.68] P:1589.80 E:0.102417 |  City scored three goals yeah it was too easy for Silva to get that ball in and it was just far too
[5685.68 - 5690.72] P:1518.08 E:0.100820 |  easy to get John Stones on the end of that back post header to get the ball across for Harland
[5690.72 - 5696.56] P:1599.57 E:0.095308 |  just to tap home but I mean wow they're really capitalizing some bad runner form from up in
[5696.56 - 5702.32] P:1506.60 E:0.096883 |  Meccano and just kind of some drop in momentum from Bayern Munich and I have to be honest it's
[5703.52 - 5709.28] P:1376.52 E:0.100525 |  pretty great to see. Bayern Munich under pressure again, put Meccano closed down by Grilich and
[5709.28 - 5714.80] P:1348.81 E:0.096389 |  Somert clears over the halfway line he'd hit a one by Stones but Bayern Munich will send it forward
[5714.80 - 5720.48] P:1512.74 E:0.105497 |  once again Canabri can they get a goal back Sanez and they're Canabri still going excellent challenge
[5720.48 - 5725.92] P:1444.13 E:0.111355 |  at the back by Ruben Diaz big high fives amongst the Manchester City defence and City are coming

[6056.48 - 6061.04] P:1604.97 E:0.090590 |  just not really enough time to really make that much of an impact and I think what we saw from

[6193.20 - 6206.00] P:1470.56 E:0.092351 |  for Jan Summer. It's amazing how confidence can drain out of a play because that unfortunately
[6206.00 - 6212.08] P:1452.41 E:0.085959 |  is what we've seen happen with Daioh Pramikana the France international could it be costly even

[6239.60 - 6244.56] P:1712.65 E:0.093731 |  just defies gravity just float in the air and get two hands to that and just tip it over the crossbar
[6244.56 - 6251.20] P:1555.95 E:0.089104 |  what a fantastic save brilliant stop as Manchester City swing the corner in again now they're claiming
[6251.20 - 6255.76] P:1499.22 E:0.093780 |  for a penalty the whistle is gone the freekits gone the way Bayern Munich there's no way the referee
[6255.76 - 6259.52] P:1400.62 E:0.094946 |  is going to let them take it from their edge of their own area it's been very hot on that our
[6259.52 - 6266.16] P:1487.36 E:0.087370 |  referee but that we are underway so the AR either had a quick check a lot of time to check for the
[6266.16 - 6273.36] P:1453.15 E:0.085638 |  handball because once you restart can't call it back but still Bayern Munich very much up against
[6273.36 - 6280.40] P:1428.97 E:0.091031 |  it not just on the night but in the tie second leg in Germany to come next week but Manchester
[6280.40 - 6288.24] P:1531.19 E:0.106167 |  City have taken a real stranglehold of this encounter as Paavard out of frustration chops
[6288.24 - 6293.52] P:1361.93 E:0.097233 |  down Grealish and is into the book I wonder if Jack Grealish ever counts as bruises
[6294.32 - 6295.28] P:1529.70 E:0.117203 |  so you must have a lot
[6298.72 - 6302.40] P:1472.30 E:0.099673 |  just a little bit of pushing and shoving between the players the referee just
[6303.36 - 6308.80] P:1356.40 E:0.096784 |  giving Joshua Kimmich a push on his way as well I think you're right Vicky I think what it was I
[6308.80 - 6313.84] P:1392.99 E:0.095844 |  think I think it might have been Kimmich that was leaning over Jack Grealish as if to say get up
[6314.56 - 6318.08] P:1331.94 E:0.103854 |  the boys heard what he was saying they weren't happy with him at all so Diaz pushed him out
[6318.08 - 6321.28] P:1350.94 E:0.102773 |  the way and Akin Kaiman as well looking after their teammate
[6324.32 - 6326.24] P:1542.03 E:0.104061 |  so two minutes plus had a time to play
[6328.56 - 6335.92] P:1363.28 E:0.091472 |  and a very contented S.E.H.A.D. it will be nine wins in a row in all competitions for
[6335.92 - 6342.08] P:1549.13 E:0.097554 |  Pep Guardiola's Manchester City it's their best run of form this season it might add to their three
[6342.08 - 6347.92] P:1499.51 E:0.084986 |  goals here is John Stones out on the right wing has Harland in the centre was about to Bernardo

[6355.20 - 6360.64] P:1633.31 E:0.101086 |  area but it's over the angle of post and ball some beautiful passing within that little passage
[6360.64 - 6365.68] P:1479.98 E:0.094821 |  you play there Bernardo Silver's pinging to John Stones and John Stones passes it back and
[6365.68 - 6370.08] P:1552.11 E:0.099441 |  they just pass the ball with the right weight and the nice crossfield ball there to Jack Grealish
[6370.08 - 6374.16] P:1602.75 E:0.097634 |  try to curl it in the corner obviously City are in control of this game when it comes to
[6374.72 - 6380.88] P:1432.57 E:0.092413 |  to goals but I think they've drained all the energy out of Bayern tonight Bayern playing the game
[6380.88 - 6385.12] P:1480.73 E:0.087906 |  at one pace unfortunately City play the game at a different pace and it's a lot faster
[6386.00 - 6391.20] P:1491.29 E:0.085592 |  Ape McCarno out to the right hand side in Pavar Bayern Munich struggling to get out of their own
[6391.20 - 6395.04] P:1484.45 E:0.087986 |  half at the moment trailing by three goals to Niel and Karen Barzley former Manchester City
[6395.04 - 6399.20] P:1645.90 E:0.088159 |  and England goalkeeper alongside us you know we praised Jan Sommer but Edison made some key
[6399.20 - 6403.92] P:1491.47 E:0.091064 |  saves at one nail as well that then allowed Manchester City wants Bernardo Silver headed in
[6403.92 - 6410.56] P:1554.79 E:0.092747 |  to build to what will be this victory in the second half oh yeah absolutely uh Edison was fantastic
[6410.56 - 6415.44] P:1555.65 E:0.095073 |  especially the very early start of that second half I think City came out a bit lethargic
[6416.08 - 6420.96] P:1623.17 E:0.097074 |  Bayern Munich had obviously had a real good talking to at halftime and Sane looked like he was really
[6420.96 - 6426.08] P:1527.91 E:0.093960 |  really up for I think Dion said that you know we saw three opportunities in relatively quick
[6426.16 - 6430.96] P:1545.08 E:0.091113 |  succession and without that I think yeah I mean this could have been a different ball game
[6431.52 - 6438.16] P:1503.25 E:0.097250 |  here goes Raul Cancelo the booing in he might mistake it for shoot the block is made by Akangy
[6438.16 - 6443.20] P:1492.90 E:0.090685 |  the online Manchester City man and out to the left hand side the ball goes throw to Bayern Munich
[6443.20 - 6448.80] P:1640.09 E:0.085198 |  if they could get a goal back it would really change the complexion of this time because at the
[6448.80 - 6453.68] P:1498.39 E:0.090313 |  moment there is very little hope for Thomas Tuchel's side still the second leg to come we know we've
[6453.68 - 6458.00] P:1527.58 E:0.090195 |  seen remarkable games in Europe they're not out of it yet but at three nil down
[6458.64 - 6463.44] P:1496.25 E:0.087496 |  it's fingertips stuff and serves a clinging on a goal back could change that
[6466.08 - 6471.28] P:1513.85 E:0.099449 |  into three minutes of out of time at the end of this second half Manchester City lead by the
[6471.28 - 6478.16] P:1608.86 E:0.082011 |  three goals as Mane brings it down for Bayern Munich out to the right hand side now and Kingsley

[6746.24 - 6751.28] P:1321.47 E:0.113866 |  in their previous eight matches in this Champions League campaign and as you say the clean sheet
[6751.92 - 6758.32] P:1287.87 E:0.115549 |  such a boon for Manchester City as well they have a real stranglehold on this quarter final

[6764.00 - 6771.12] P:1830.15 E:0.113870 |  lots more with Vicki Sparks Deon Dublin coming up coming up very very shortly as we reflect on
[6771.12 - 6776.80] P:1906.86 E:0.107120 |  this game between Manchester City really impressive win over Bayern Munich we'll be hearing from the
[6776.80 - 6781.84] P:1987.87 E:0.108260 |  guys we hear from Karen Bardley and we'll be hearing from you on social media City favorites
[6781.84 - 6786.16] P:1980.17 E:0.107344 |  for the Champions League this year from me says Mark Harland he thinks has been missing piece of the
[6786.16 - 6790.72] P:1991.57 E:0.101014 |  puzzle Daniel though picks out Jack Grealis saying he might not have the goal or the assist but the
[6790.72 - 6795.36] P:1971.40 E:0.104022 |  contribution has been massive tonight Nick says for all the quality have been really really impressed
[6795.36 - 6800.48] P:1862.86 E:0.103271 |  by Ruben D as a superb player but Richard points out outstanding play by every single one of City's
[6800.48 - 6805.44] P:1847.73 E:0.102509 |  players tonight not a single weakness on the pitch he says from anyone in blue as I said we'll have
[6805.44 - 6811.76] P:1979.67 E:0.104655 |  lots more from all the guys here from Karen from Deon and from Vicki it's all over or it's nearly
[6811.76 - 6818.24] P:1952.68 E:0.102328 |  all over between Ben Fika and Inter Milan Sahel Sahi yeah it is now Kelly it's Ben Fika now
[6818.32 - 6824.24] P:2001.61 E:0.097374 |  Inter Milan two a super evening in Lisbon for Inter they were majestic from start to finish
[6824.24 - 6830.64] P:2000.19 E:0.090466 |  both goals in the second half Nicola Barela heading in them into the lead after a deep cross from
[6830.64 - 6836.88] P:1976.39 E:0.084380 |  Bustoni the second came from the penalty spot Jean-Maria was penalized for a handball Michael
[6836.88 - 6842.88] P:2017.61 E:0.080492 |  Oliver the referee tonight he checked the pitch side monitor and awarded the spot kick to Inter Milan
[6842.88 - 6850.24] P:1991.64 E:0.080990 |  Lukaku he did the rest Ben Fika's first defeat in Europe this season that could prove very costly
[6850.24 - 6856.96] P:1920.63 E:0.085330 |  so after the first leg Ben Fika Nill Inter Milan two Sahel thank you very much for that elsewhere
[6856.96 - 6862.48] P:1945.85 E:0.098388 |  England 30 game unbeaten run under Serena Begman has come to an end at the hands of Australia
[6862.48 - 6868.00] P:1927.58 E:0.104223 |  they were beaten 2-0 in their final scheduled game before this summer's World Cup England and WSL
[6868.00 - 6873.04] P:1937.07 E:0.099248 |  defender Jelly Flaherty was part of our commentary team on Sports Extra Jelly was this the kind of
[6873.04 - 6878.08] P:1824.12 E:0.087902 |  performance that we're used to seeing from the lionesses no not at all I mean I think obviously
[6878.08 - 6885.20] P:1738.24 E:0.103470 |  over the last 30 young unbeaten game run England have 99% of those games dominated it you know and
[6885.20 - 6891.20] P:1847.85 E:0.090697 |  dictated the the tempo of the games you know they've they've sort of teams have dropped off them but
[6891.20 - 6896.08] P:1702.01 E:0.101978 |  they've controlled it they've been able to do one two touch around teams and been able to move teams
[6896.08 - 6900.08] P:1830.69 E:0.092433 |  because of the level the opposition that they played against would follow the runs and
[6900.08 - 6904.24] P:1922.69 E:0.101114 |  sort of become disjointed but tonight Australia didn't do that they were very compact they were
[6904.24 - 6909.60] P:1774.87 E:0.095598 |  very disciplined defensively and England couldn't break them down so then England become frustrated
[6909.60 - 6914.24] P:1707.87 E:0.099197 |  and they sort of didn't have a plan B and for me Australia deserved to win tonight's game
[6915.20 - 6919.84] P:1833.33 E:0.111070 |  you said before the game you were worried about the lack of relationship between Asmomorgan and
[6919.84 - 6925.04] P:1905.30 E:0.095078 |  Jess Carter did was that an area that Australia were able to exploit yeah I think you see especially
[6925.04 - 6930.16] P:1766.76 E:0.096931 |  as the game went on and become more and more exposed and obviously then Jess Carter ended up
[6930.16 - 6934.96] P:1897.17 E:0.094127 |  coming off towards the end of the game but I also think what didn't help Jess Carter was the fact
[6934.96 - 6939.20] P:1945.83 E:0.097453 |  that she wasn't getting much support from her wingers with tracking back Ellie Carpenter is a
[6939.20 - 6944.48] P:1936.93 E:0.097553 |  a fallback who's aggressive she likes to join in she likes to overlap so there's only so much that
[6944.48 - 6949.60] P:1906.24 E:0.099808 |  Jess Carter can do and I think you see in the first 10 15 minutes with Lauren Hemp she was tracking back
[6949.60 - 6954.80] P:1851.67 E:0.096322 |  she was helping Jess Carter out with Carpenter and then in the second half it sort of opened up even
[6954.88 - 6959.28] P:1836.74 E:0.097147 |  more and she didn't have that support Chloe Kelly wasn't offering it Lauren James wasn't offering it
[6959.28 - 6963.60] P:1777.90 E:0.095938 |  so she was all isolated there and then obviously then the distance and the gap between her and
[6963.60 - 6970.72] P:1824.48 E:0.094195 |  Esme Morgan sort of grew as the game went on and Australia exploited it exactly 100 days to go now
[6970.72 - 6975.44] P:1804.27 E:0.104971 |  until the World Cup in Australia in the summer where they couldn't meet them in the last 16 of
[6975.44 - 6980.80] P:1931.41 E:0.100730 |  the World Cup is there anything that that's concerning you from from this performance can you put it
[6980.80 - 6986.16] P:1871.00 E:0.089142 |  down to a blip given that England have been on such a brilliant run-of-form for me it just it
[6986.16 - 6991.44] P:1778.87 E:0.099016 |  concerns me that I feel like they don't have a plan B and it's funny because someone on social
[6991.44 - 6997.44] P:1895.53 E:0.099821 |  media has said that where before in the Euros for example Alessia Russo and Ella Toon was used as a
[6997.44 - 7002.16] P:1785.02 E:0.091858 |  sort of super subs when now they're not they're not starters you know so you don't have them come
[7002.16 - 7008.00] P:1877.46 E:0.095465 |  off the bench and impacting games they're not starting games so what do you do if 65 70 minutes
[7008.00 - 7012.32] P:1866.90 E:0.098794 |  you haven't got the impact that you wanted from them you can't bring them on again because they've
[7012.32 - 7017.52] P:1842.26 E:0.103016 |  already playing so who do you look to all so you potentially change it and and start Rachel Daly in
[7017.52 - 7022.56] P:1868.51 E:0.104254 |  games that you know then you could bring Alessia Russo on and Ella Toon on for the last 20 25 minutes
[7022.56 - 7026.48] P:1834.85 E:0.094849 |  because that's what worked for them in the Euros so is that potentially what needs to happen now
[7026.48 - 7030.80] P:1883.01 E:0.100110 |  because obviously you had Ellen White starting in the Euros ahead of Alessia Russo do you now
[7030.80 - 7035.28] P:1872.35 E:0.098778 |  change it do you put Rachel Daly there as your number nine and when you know how effective Alessia
[7035.28 - 7040.56] P:1876.89 E:0.090933 |  Russo and Ella Toon are it's coming off the bench but I just built with England they didn't have
[7040.56 - 7045.52] P:1857.28 E:0.091629 |  that and I feel they sort of played into Australia's hands by playing how Australia played but the
[7045.52 - 7050.24] P:1886.51 E:0.091996 |  difference is like I said to Maz is the back four for Australia was set England were trying to play
[7050.24 - 7055.92] P:1850.28 E:0.094253 |  long balls over the top for Alessia Russo or Rachel Daly but the back four you've not moved them you
[7055.92 - 7060.00] P:1954.70 E:0.099076 |  have to move them and that's what Australia were doing they were moving and destroying England's
[7060.08 - 7065.44] P:1922.13 E:0.086848 |  back four so that when they went long the space was there. Jilly good to talk to you thanks so much
