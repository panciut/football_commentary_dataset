What a moment for Gareth Southgate, he has got rid of his blue jacket but he's wearing his waistcoat. Not really a night for waistcoats, it is quite warm here inside the stadium but he steps down into the tunnel and the teams shake one another's hands. The Tunisia side this evening to begin their World Cup campaign here, Young Mouaise Hassan the goalkeeper. Then a back four of Jilann Bronn, Siam Ben-Yusuf and Yassine Maria with Ali Malul at left back. In midfield, Eliez Skiri and Ferjani Sasi with Naim Slitti playing behind Wabi Qazri, the Sunderland man who's been on loan in France this season. He's the captain tonight with the wide men, Anise Badri on the right and Fekradine Ben-Yusuf on the left hand side who's a big man six foot four. The England team to begin the World Cup here in Volgograd is Jordan Pickford in goal, his competitive debut. Three central defenders in Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Maguire. The most capped man in the squad, Gary Cahill only a substitute. Here in Trippier and Ashley Young are the wing backs. Jordan Henderson has Lingard and Ali either side of him in midfield with Raheem Sterling playing off Harry Kane. The Tunisia players are just posing for their team photograph. All white kit with the red numbers and England all in red tonight. Already getting into position and just going around giving one another a final hug and a final good look message. So Chris Waddle, it's about to begin for England. This is it, this is it, this is where you start, this is where you go. It's been difficult for a lot of teams in this tournament so far who will really rate it highly to go and beat this so-called lesser nations who are not as good as football supposedly. Every team Barham Rush has found it very difficult and I'm sure England would love to get off to a winning start tonight. Well it is about time that England exceeded expectations at a major tournament. It has not happened for too long. Gareth Southgate has brought here to Russia this young squad, this inexperienced squad and they're playing a Tunisian team that is ranked 21 in the world. Lost by only one goal to Nell against Spain just before the World Cup, drew with Portugal, drew with Turkey. Before that, before the Spain game they had not lost for over a year. This could be a very hard night for England. But Gareth Southgate has told his players to go out and enjoy representing England at a World Cup. They haven't won England their opening match at a tournament for 12 years since World Cup 2006. But we're almost ready now here in Volgograd on the fifth day in the 14th match. England are about to play for the first time at this 2018 World Cup. And it will be England to get the match underway. We're just waiting for the whistle from the Colombian referee, Wilmar Roldan, who is just glancing at his watch. Bright blue shirt that he's wearing. The video assistant referee is from Brazil, Sandro Richie. He is in the control centre and here in the stadium on five live. England's World Cup campaign in Russia begins as the ball is played back into central defence to John Stones. And immediately out it goes to Kyle Walker on the right hand side. In this first half as we look high up in the second tier on the dugout side of the stadium, England playing from right to left. And McGuire gets his first touch at a World Cup. Last time England were at a tournament, Harry McGuire and his brothers were in France as supporters, as playing spectators. And now two years later, here he is, starting the tournament in the team, preferred to Gary Cahill. Kyle Walker, Tunisia, haven't had a touch yet. And then a long pass from over on the right hand side from Kieran Trippia is... Bidray is a few nerves, a little bit of adrenaline, he over hits it through to the young goalkeeper, Hassan. This can start by England from the kickoff though, they kept the ball very well. And you've got to say, Tunisia, come out of the blocks quickly, try to press them, try to get the ball back quickly. England's a pass that ground them very, very well in fortitude, this ball goes too long. But now Tunisia's getting in the ball and they like to look after it. Tunisia, Nill, England, Nill. And if you're rushing home to see England playing at the World Cup, it is on BBC One tonight. Guy Mawbray and Martin Keona just over to our left, so you can watch it when you get home. But you can also listen to the Five Life commentary as well with the pictures, it's all synced up via the red button. That is live now for you. The ball played back to goalkeeper Hassan, who is under pressure and he's passed it straight out of play. He should have sent it, sorry, England pressed them really high there and went back to the keeper. He didn't have an opportunity, he should have played it long up to Casvue, he was on his own up front, he didn't. And to throw in England's took quickly. Throw in for England, that Young takes and it finds its way all the way back towards the halfway line to John Stone. So actually plays it, got a shanks it, some distance behind Kyle Walker. Three off the tee though. It finds its way back to John Stone's who uses Kyle Walker. Just a few months ago, wouldn't have expected him in central defence. The ball is played over the top down the right hand side and Gallialli takes it on and crosses into the edge of the penalty area. Oh, they haven't cleared it, Tunisia, Lingard with a chance and the goalkeeper is able to save it on the line. Poor defending from Tunisia, they had the chance to clear their lines, they didn't take it and Lingard actually should have scored from six, seven yards. It's a great ball by John Ennis and he hooks it on behinds, Gallialli fizzes it across as a base club, he should clear the defender, doddles on it. And Lingard could save this, the keeper has left foot but he should score. He was central, he was in the middle of the goal, Lingard, he had the chance but it was too close to the goalkeeper. However, England will take heart from that nervous start from Tunisia who've not won a match at a World Cup since 1978. Here's the corner then, Trippier takes it and a bouncing header that Hassan has to dive to his right to claw away. It might have been bouncing wide in any case actually but the young goalkeeper all in black, he's winning only his fourth cap here tonight. And it's bounced out of play and actually I think it's... It's an offside, it's an offside, there's three of them offside on the six yard box but they cleared their lanes very quickly, there's a ball came and out swinging corner. They all got up very quickly and they caught three of them offside but this is the key for England really, they can sniff it out, press them, they take risks Tunisia, you can see that already. A lot of risks, go and press them. Jesse Lingard shot, that was inches away from giving England the lead. You don't know it's early in the game but he's got to score that for me. Absolutely, Tunisia 0, England 0, BBC 5 live and Tunisia yet to launch their first attack of the game really with three nearly four minutes played. Oh, Stirling, that was a strong challenge on Stirling however, Dali Ali takes it on through the middle for England, angle pass back, now Yeslingard squares it to the back post, oh and it's put wide. Stirling was in there in the six yard box, a slight angle but that, that certainly should have been the opening goal for England. And Stirling has missed it. He's just onside, Lingard's great reverse ball by Dali Ali and Lingard does everything right. Pick Stirling now coming in at the far post, it's a simple tapping let's be honest, he gets there, he had to adjust himself slightly but he didn't know which foot to take it with. He's kicked it with his left foot, he should have took it with his right, a safe foot and he scuffed it wide, great chance again that's two. Still Tunisia, nil, England nil, England should be in front either through Lingard, certainly through Stirling, what a chance and the goalkeeper actually has taken a bang as he came out to narrow the angle, Lingard squaring it to Stirling. I think on Lingard's follow through, he must have caught pass in. He's short as they're rubbing and they're trying to get right the goal, that goal he's warming up but just looking back at that chance with sword again and again on the replay. Stirling doesn't know which foot to take it with, it's a safe foot, right foot, safe foot, open goal. Why is he trying to swing his left hand that I do not know and he's ended up scuffing it horribly wide and I think it had both feet in front. He tried to adjust, he tried to pull the brakes on actually because Lingard rather than being able to play it in front of Stirling, it was straight at him, he was arriving at pace and he just tried to get his feet right and he got it all wrong. Right foot, side foot and he scores. The goalkeeper is not happy about his shoulder, I think he realizes it's going to be a hard evening for him. Left shoulder, as I say this goalkeeper, Muaz Hassan, who is French born, seven of this Jinnesian team are French born and he's still feeling his left shoulder with his gloved right hand, playing in League 2 in France this season for Chateau Roux, on loan from Nice. That was the first free kick of the game, was it by Harry McGuire? And it's a free kick to Chinisia that is going to be taken from way down in front of our commentary position by Sasi, one of these two central midfielders for the Chinisian side. They've not really settled into the match, they're qualified for the World Cup Chinisia first in 1978, one of the World Cup in Argentina 40 years ago. They won their first match against Mexico and haven't won a game at the World Cup since in 11 matches over those 40 years. I think they look very nervous John. Very. Stones has to stretch here but he is able to play it across to Walker who immediately returns it to Stones and then the ball is out to Kyrie and Tripier on the right hand side. He only played for England for the first time, Tripier a year ago. His family are England daft, they're football mad, he's got 15 of his family here in Russia, including his dad, who is as big an England fan as you'll find, so what a proud moment for the Tripier family who I guess will be inside the stadium somewhere this evening. It's nil nil on five life, Harry McGuire is just going to have to stretch to keep it is, but he does on the left hand side and actually the player who came in to challenge, Badri has gone down holding his face, the ball's been put out of play and we've got another player down on the surface of the pitch. Yeah, we're not going to get this all night, trying to get people booked and sent off, I didn't really see a lot happening with Harry McGuire. It's Ashley Young, he does catch him but it's accidental, there's no, he's not mean it, it does not mean to catch him like that and they're all moaning about it, that was just an accident. He's off the ball actually, as McGuire was in possession Ashley Young came in and sort of shielded Badri, but he's back on his feet and the referee I guess the VAR officials have told referee Roldan who's spoken to Ashley Young but it's nothing more than that, just a telling off. Kyle Walker fizzes a pass, that's 60, 70 yards, it's chested down by Gallialli but he can't keep it in and it's out of play for a threesome to Chinisia. So if you've joined us late, England's World Cup is underway here in Volgograd and they should be in front, chances for Lingard that was saved by the goalkeeper's foot and Sterling that was missed badly, it was almost right, it was an open goal. So, Marlul the left back takes it on, for the first time now we see Chinisia looking threatening with Slitty, Naim Slitty, he was one of the players, I know you watch a lot of French football Chris, you warned me about the potential of Slitty and here he is now playing the ball to the right hand side where Ben Youssef has appeared. What a ball that is. Out to the left hand side and now Chinisia coming forward threateningly with Marlul, Chinisia with Kasri inside the penalty area but it's played back into a central area to Saasi and now Square and out to the right hand side by the pass though from Saasi was way beyond the right back brawn and it's out of play for a throw into England, another nervous touch from Chinisia. You can see when England don't press and you can't press all the time, you've got to be switched on, here Tally Butcher talked about the defence being organised totally, you've got to because they are very talented, maybe they do overplay too much. Five Live, every time there's a match at this World Cup, whenever it's on you'll hear commentary from BBC Radio either on Five Live, here on Five Live, on Sports Extra or via the BBC Sport website, three more matches for you tomorrow. This time tomorrow night we'll be bringing a commentary from St Petersburg on Russia's second match, that should be an occasion as well in the very proud Russian city of St Petersburg. Here in Volgograd, way down in the south, next to the Volga River, we're watching England bringing the ball over the half way line, Maguire to Jung. Jung turns and plays it back towards Harry Maguire who goes back into central defence and John Stones uses Walker again, who has a look up, Kyle Walker and gives it to his former club mate, Trippia, who chips it back into central defence. Patient play from England, the whistles from the Tunisian fans, it's actually quite difficult to tell whether there are more Tunisian fans or England fans inside the ground. Harry Kane now gets the ball back from Sterling, Kane shoots it, took a little deflection, oh the goalkeeper has kept it in but the assistant on the far side says it was out, which is just as well for the goalkeeper because he very nearly presented the ball to Delhi Ali. He did, trying to keep it in but the England in first corner got caught offside but they won the head up, England very dangerous to set pieces. First time we've seen Harry Kane, the England captain, yet to score at a tournament, failed to score for the under 21s, didn't score two years ago in France either. Corner, Jung to take it from the left hand side, he mops his perspiring brow and here's the delivery which is headed and saved and puts it to the back, England are in front and it's Harry Kane! He's got his goal in a major finals, he's got his first goal in a World Cup finals and England have their first goal here in Russia, 1-0 England! Well again I've said the danger some set pieces, actually Jung just floats one in, I think it's Harry McQuaier gets up, he gets a target and Harry Kane reacts first, nobody tracks him and he's there with the same football, it's a great save by the keeper, he's done ever so well again across the goal. Great header by Stones, it is, he gets up, far post and he was there, Harry Kane, side foot volley, 1-0 and I've got to say they deserved it. Corner from the Ashley Jung delivery, powerful header from John Stones, 8-9 yards out, the goalkeeper actually did extremely well, the clawed it out diving to his left but he clawed it out with his left hand and who was there in the six yard box, right on the spot, Harry Kane who continues this record of scoring in every match when he has started as the England captain, that is now seven goals in the six matches he started as the captain and actually the run in all England games for Harry Kane is nine in his last eight appearances, just what England needed, the early goal and the early goal for captain Kane. Yeah, and he set pieces, first corner they won, they were offside this time, Ryan Sterling would have been offside if he tapped in but Harry Kane was alongside Stones as he headed it, he followed in, he anticipated it and he got the save foot volley, he got his reward, 1-0. Come on Chris, you've been involved in so many major tournaments, to score in the first 15 minutes, really important. Yeah, they've dominated as well, let's be honest, they've had a little bit of play in his yellow show, what they can do, they do all the play, the goalkeeper's gone down again, great save from Stones header but nobody followed in, Harry Kane so I think he could say his game is finished. Well whether he injured his shoulder further because he was diving to his left and he really stretched and it was a really good save. And he is lying on his right side in the Tunisian penalty area, what an enormous disappointment for this young man, Muaz Hassan, who only made his first appearance for Tunisia back in March, was selected to start on the World Cup and in the opening minutes, has injured his shoulder, I think he was caught wasn't he by Jesse Lingard, when Lingard went through for England's first goal scoring opportunity and it would appear to be a great save. I think it would appear that he is going to struggle to continue in this match. So we've got a little bit of a stoppage while Hassan receives treatment and the England players are going across and receiving the water bottles, it is quite warm here in the stadium, we're two hours ahead of you in the UK, so it's late in the evening here, it's getting dark in Volgograd and the England players are now making their way back out to take up a position and I think that is going to be a great save. That is the end on his in tears, the poor lad Muaz Hassan, that's actually quite upsetting to see him having to leave the field and his teammates are going across and one or two giving him a little kiss on the side of his head and his World Cup, I mean his feelings tonight to think he was going to play in a World Cup and it's lasted less than a quarter of an hour. I don't know how you just feel for the lad and Wilton is your qualified for the next one, so we may never get another chance. So how will we wait to end the World Cup being injured? We're still waiting actually for the substitution to be completed, I'm not sure if I presume it's Matluthi who is going to come on or is it? I think Matluthi was being prepared and it looks as though because Matluthi has been the long time first choice for Tunisia, the 33 year old who has quite a stellar record really in African football and it's not him, no it is Farooq Ben Mustafa who is coming on to the field. So Ben Mustafa who is actually the nominated number one coming on to win his 15th cat. I wouldn't have thought the other goalkeeper John's going to slide into himself which would explain why perhaps he hasn't started the match. So we've had a long, long stoppage there while Hassan received his treatment and eventually the substitution was made but that is strange because that has taken a long time for Tunisia to make that change. So Ben Mustafa steps into Tunisia's World Cup. England are leading by one goal to mill. This is BBC Five Live at the World Cup with England Chris Waddle, part of the commentary team here in Volgograd. You can listen as well via the BBC Sport app, you can watch it on BBC One and you can listen to us, our commentary with the pictures via the red button. But England with the ball at the back after that lengthy stoppage, you need to keep the focus and Walker who is being pressed here manages to win a goal kick as he was being pressed on the far side by Badri. It could be better for England because Tunisia are going to press, they've got to get back into the game. They've had one decent spell of passing the ball in this what for 60 minutes and now look how high the press is. They'll make an England kick it long and they realise they've got to try and get a goal back very quickly. Tunisia mill, England one. And Tunisia in possession, centrally with Saasi, now out to the right hand side where it's played infield by Ben Youssef. And Ben Youssef now, a challenge by Young and Ben Youssef who as I've mentioned is six foot four, went down very easily there, there wasn't too much in that. It was a shoulder to shoulder challenge, no free kick given and now Walker at the back for England in the right back position, hits a long long ball downfield towards Sterling. It's headed away but possession given back to England and Lingard in the orange boots finds space on the left hand side for Ashley Young. Young now making good ground down the left hand side, checks back, gives it to Sterling who's available and now Sterling with a little touch back towards Harry Maguire. Again Raheem Sterling turns, tight aerial, three Tunisians around him but he does well, Walker now slips the ball to Tripier on the right hand side. Tripier drives it across between two England players, half cleared then Henderson with a shot that is saved down to his right by the new goalkeeper Ben Mustafa. Well I think Southgate was hoping England would put a performance on from the off and they have so far, it could easily be four in a lot, they've been that good against Tunisia, Tunisia can't get a kick. And Jordan Henderson with that latest effort from 25 yards famously never scored for England in a senior international, this is his 40th cap, the most capped player in this England team that started this World Cup here and started it well too. Against frankly nervous and rather fragile looking Tunisian team, goal kick Tunisia. I totally agree with you John, I know they were talking England up saying they were a good side and they've come out, they look more nervous in England. In England really for me so far in this game have been excellent, pressed creating chances, not at the other end they look solid, passed the ball early, well, I mean at the other end, I'm not sure whether. And how many touches has Kasri had of the ball, very few. Maguire wins the header on the halfway line from the Tunisian goal kick and heads it straight out of play just in front of the Tunisian dugout there, coach Nabil Malul is standing there and his red trainers and his black body warmer. Ball hooked forward, for Tunisia, Kasri beaten in the air, John Stones, the ball is passed forward towards goal scorer Harry Kane. Kane infield to Lingard, now the ball out from Lingard, beyond Trippier and out of play for throw in. Lingard's just taken a bang there, just after he played it. Just on the ankle as he plays it as the late challenge goes in, not a free kick though, would say just over hits it. A good play again by England, in the feet, Harry Kane, lovely little tough turn. You know England have not won their first match at a tournament, either World Cup or European Championship since Germany in 2006. Since then, and that was against Paraguay, I think you and I watched that match together, it was an early own goal and England won it 1-0 in Frankfurt against Paraguay. Since then, didn't make it to Euro 2008, drew in South Africa against the USA, drew against France in 2012, lost to Italy in 2004 and two years ago. We watched England draw against Russia when the Russians scored that late equaliser after Eric Dyer's free kick goal. England 1-0 up here and perhaps on the course for the victory that they want to start this campaign. Jordan Pickford is coming out to take this free kick half way inside the England half, out on the far side of the field. There are some empty white seats, you can clearly see them around the stadium so it's not completely full but it'll be early 40,000s in terms of the attendance. Pickford then with this long free kick up towards Harry Kane, the goal scorer, it's out to Delhi Ali, Kane gets a good touch as he falls actually and very nearly set Delhi Ali in round the outside. It's cleared out of play for a throw into England, just about level with the edge of the Tunisian box. Trippier takes it back to Walker and then they go back to Stones again, the middle man of this England back three. Heavy-ish touch by McGuire but he's able to recover and give it to Jung, Jung lifts it forward but that's blocked by right back Bronn. Jung gets another chance though, Henderson now playing a square ball towards Walkout, lots of options for Walker in front of him. He goes short to Henderson and then a little pass towards Delhi Ali, Ali, for Walker and Walker continues to bring it forward, it bounces for Sterling on the edge of the area. He rides the challenge that comes in on him, tries to flick it as he's challenged again and it is Tunisia who break away with the ball. Kasri's pulled out towards the left-hand side but Slitty I'm not sure he was aware of where he was Kasri, he went right and that came to nothing and Pickford now hits a long downfield too. Tunisia's trying to get on the ball and you can see they're passing and they want to show their abilities but give England credit. They've hustled and they've got the ball back and England played some great stuff. Tunisia came into this World Cup, they've known this for long enough, they lost their star player, Yusuf Masakny of Sevilla who picked up a knee injury well in advance of the World Cup, Cruciate injury that put him out of the competition. They also lost their first choice forward, Tahai Yasin Kanisi, so important players they lost and they do as we say look like they're lacking a cutting edge. However here's Bron the way down the right-hand side for Tunisia, Bron with a cross and it's bounced off the recovering Delhi Ali behind for Tunisia's first corner. That's the first bit of mix-up we've seen, Harim Agwea gets dragged in there instead of staying in the zone and watching the runner for cover, he goes, drags in, Ashly Young gets dragged inside and they all think the ball's coming inside and that's an easy, Bron gets right round the back, gets himself a corner out of it. So the first time that England have had to defend a set piece, Kasri is going to take this. Wabi Kasri, still a Sunderland player on loan at Wren this season where he did well actually, they ended up in mid-table, Kasri standing with his hands on his hips, swings the ball, it's an out swinger but it's over everyone inside the box. Stretch forward on the edge of the area but Tunisia pick up possession again with Slitty and Slitty moves away from Ali and Slitty shoots from an angle but that sails away high and wide into the England fans. Actually just behind where Rachel Burden's standing down there and the supporters of the match actually gives us a little wave as well down there. Just so sliddy there, great turn, how he gets away and bit of skill, you want to talk much about the shot, high and wide. You'll hear Rachel by the way, obviously during the course of this match and the evening, we will have a 6-0-6 this evening, Kelly Cates and Terry Butcher live in Moscow for that and Rachel will be live here in Volgograd into the five live breakfast in the morning from 6 o'clock. He is actually young on the left hand side, is England another attack, now winning 1-0, young right foot across to the back post, Lindgaard is down, he's bounced his shot into the ground and wide and that's another good chance that has gone begging for England. I just think I hope it don't get punished, it should be 5-0, it's onside, the marking is absolutely, it's sure it's just from Tunisia. Once you get three or four passes and you get away this year, you don't have to be high, just put it in the box, England's got three or four every time that ball goes in the box, the Q and up to put it in. Unfortunately, it's only Harry Kane can. Badly miss hit that really by Lindgaard. It should be game over, this should be game over. This is something that we have said about England, while they have been developing this system, they haven't been putting teams away by any means. England, now as we sit here this evening, their last defeat was over a year ago, so they've gone throughout the course of this season unbeaten. Started this season with the World Cup qualifier in Malta, where they actually laboured to a 4-0 win. Three of the goals, remember, came very late. But since then, two against Slovakia, one against Slovenia, one against Lithuania, Germany and Brazil were 0-0 draws, one 0 in Amsterdam against the Netherlands, one against Italy in the draw, and then in the two warm-up games against Nigeria and Costa Rica, two goals in each of those matches. So, chances coming and going, and as Chris Waddle rightly says, England supporters will be hoping that they don't live to regret the misses. Here they come down the right hand side again though, but sterling just a poor touch really, and Jiniz Jurev got the ball back in central defence with Bron, Ziland Bron plays it to the right hand side, he had a bad-dry, and then it comes back into central defence to Siam Ben-Yusuf, and now out to the left hand side to Mar-Lual, and Mar-Luald, who's had a hamstring injury coming up to this World Cup, but has obviously shaken it off and covered from it. And then a ball through the middle for Kasri to chase, but Jordan Pickford will get there well ahead of Kasri and dive forward and gather the ball into his chest. We've had 25 minutes of England's World Cup campaign, the first match here, earlier in the opening match in this group, Belgium won well by 3 goals to 0 against Panama, couple of goals from Lukaku, one from Mertens, very good first goal from Mertens, and earlier Sweden 1-0 winners against South Korea. But you watched that game, Chris, Panama, and you said there not to be underestimated. Now, Maguire has given it away to Kasri, that's dangerous, Kasri plays it across, important touch from Stones, it was left by Walker, and still Jiniz Jurev in possession, Kasri takes it up, tries to find a way through on the edge of the box, and then an effort from just outside the D, which was deflected, the shot from Sarsie, Pickford diving to his right, but it was wide by a yard, full of corner. Sometimes, you've got to know when to send the ball, when to clear your lanes, and really he needs to be sheltered out there, Maguire. Clear it, sometimes you can't play all the time. Another corner, this time from the left-hand side, Kasri, Wabi Kasri to take this, and in swing, another 6 yard box, which is headed up and away, securely away by Harry Maguire, whose error led to that Jiniz Jurev chance, so he's made up for it with that defensive header. Slitty, plays it to the left-hand side, Jiniz Jurev pressing towards the bulk of the England fans, or at least where all of the flags are, most of the flags, ball into the penalty area, and Badri got his head to it, but headed it well wide. Ben Youssef, it was actually the big man, so headed it well wide for a goal kick. One-nil England lead, Chris Waddle, again, they've just come into the game there, Harry Maguire got caught in possession, fell asleep a bit, they're nearly punished in England from the corner, decent ball in, England clear the lanes, but I was just wondering, England's come out of the blocks at a wonderful place in tempo, but how long it's a warm evening, how long can you keep that going, what would come up with 30 minutes now, the game should be finished, England through the middle, Kane flexed it on with his head, but it's cleared away on the edge of the penalty area, and Sasi takes it forward and looks for the pass that is intercepted by Waucat, and then it's deflected out of play on the far side by Trippia for an England throw, final touch was off Slitty, so a throw in, just almost up on the halfway line. Well, England's had seven shots and four on target, and let's be honest, this game should be easy, four to five-nil. Sterling should have scored certainly, that was the most glaring miss, although Lingards wasn't far behind at the back post, Lingard also had a shot saved by young goalkeeper Hassan, who then had to go off injured, but Tunisia, over the course of the last five or six minutes, have recovered a little more ground, the score though is Tunisian-Nil, England won, Henderson swings the pass out to the right-hand side, but across moves Maria, the left-sided central defender, but all he can do is deflect it out of play for a throw in. Two England ten yards away from the corner flag, Trippia is already in position to take it, throws it back towards Kyle Walker, he takes a touch and then rolls it back into central defence, Harry McQuire passes it to Ali, who tries a flick, but it doesn't come off and Tunisia will bring the ball forward, and in fact the referee says he used a hand to control it. Skiri in midfield, who protests about it, but it is a free kick, and it's drawn the right back actually, who is making the point. Tunisian fans, you can hear what they think of that, and this is quite a protest by the Tunisian supporters for that decision, but the replays that we're seeing here are showing us that it's clearly a hand ball, it is up a left arm, free kick then in a good position for England. One nil up through Harry Kane's goal, a six yard box finish. Ashley Young should be putting this in, just drop on in behind, let's Trippia just put it in that space between the six yard box and the penalty spot, just drop it in there, you don't have to put a lot of pace on it, just drop it in there, these can't defence their pieces. Trippia stands with two hands aloft, Harry Kane on the edge of the penalty area, that Tunisian line is inching further and further out from the edge of the penalty area. The England players, there's the whistle, Trippia plays it in, just lifts it towards the back post, and it's headed across by Maguire, had the whistle gone? No, no, I think there was a whistle in the crowd. Yeah, maybe, whoever was marking him, I'd hold him. And he headed it goalwards and it was a comfortable save, Henderson. Now into a central area where Dalli Alley gets a touch but it got caught up underneath the feet of Harry Kane and Tunisian, you have to pass it away from the back, a flick towards Slitty, but Kieran Trippia was aware of the danger and deflected it out of play. Actually off Slitty and it's a free throw into England by the first half. What's Argyn about Tunisian, you can see he played it off Slitty, Kale Walker, Trippia, I don't know what they're talking about. One nil to England. We've played half an hour and it's so far so good Chris Waddle, third-caller Southgate, England. Kieran and Maguire got caught in possession once, probably that was the only scare they've had and this game should have been put to bed, it should be four or five nil for me. And England obviously would be targeting that second goal before half-time. Get as many as you can, you don't take the goose, going to finish up the Eid. That's good, you're going to say about Panama as well. Panama are not bad, I watched them today, Belgium found them hard to break down, they had a few chances themselves. And on the basis of that, actually just a little question on that, would you be tempted to play Rashford against the Panama team? Yeah, I know, I mean, obviously Sterling's doing so far all right today, I don't think you'll leave him out, but Rashford's in form as he showed in them friendlies before this tournament. Here's Sterling, Sterling gets the ball back from Deli Alley, gives it back to Alley on the right-hand side, he drives it across, takes it to Flection and it's cleared away on the edge of the six yard box by Siam Ben-Yusuf. Again, there were red shirts, there were three options in the middle, England flooding forward and searching for that second goal. Well, Tunisia can't cope with Sterling, Alley and Lindgard and obviously Hurricane. Kasary's dropped out to the right-hand side, a little bustling, shaven-headed figure, Wabby Kasary. And now he's got support on the right-hand side from Bronn, gives it back to Kasary. And they go back further towards the halfway line, Tunisia. The Eagles of Carthage as they call them, not sure whether they do actually call them that, the supporters, but that is one of those African nicknames. Here's Slitty in a central area, Slitty plays it square towards Kasary, he's 30 yards out, Kasary, Henderson closes him down so it goes out to Bronn on the right-hand side. Kasary makes a run into the box, square towards Skiri, and now again Bronn takes the ball on the right-hand side, curls over the cross, but it's beyond Kyle Walker. Oh, and he's given it penalty for Walker's challenge! That is his con de ref, I'm sorry. He's lying on the floor all this fear as soon as he gives it, he jumps in and says thanks very much. Fakradin Ben-Yusuf, check on the foul. Fakradin Ben-Yusuf, challenge Kyle Walker, there's a yellow card being shown to Walker. The VAR is being used here, we're seeing on our screen that they are checking the foul. Already we've seen a yellow card shown to Kyle Walker, there's an arms caught him, his left arm is swung round, I don't think there's any intention, but it has caught him. And so we have a penalty, and the England players are still, the check is over, we're seeing on our screen the check is over, it is going to be a penalty. So yellow card for Kyle Walker, and that's come out of almost nowhere, the big man, the number 8, Fakradin Ben-Yusuf, just putting pressure on Kyle Walker. And as the challenge came in, Walker just, his arms swung round, caught Ben-Yusuf, it went down, the referee was very close, less than 10 yards away. And it is a penalty to Inizia. I've got to say, Johnny's very unlucky, I think it's just his body, the way he takes him, we're on the way, he spins and looking at the ball, his arm comes up, and he's made a meal of it, he's made a meal of it, and the referee's bought a ball, when he says that he's playing, his arm does touch him. Well it's one of the tried and tested penalty takers in this Tunisian squad, Ferjani Sasi, who is going to take it. He takes the penalties for his club in Saudi Arabia, Al-Nasa, scored 3 and 4 matches at one point this season. So England, now for Tunisia, this will be a major break here, to get back into this game, to get level. Jordan Pickford stands on the line, a chance here, remember he scored, remember Pickford saved a penalty, and for the under-21s at the European Championship Tournament, now looking to do the same for England at the World Cup. Sasi with a penalty for Tunisia, this to make it 1-1, up he comes right foot ahead, and Pickford went the right way but couldn't keep it out. It was a very good low penalty into the bottom corner, and it is Tunisia, England won, and England have paid for not taking their chances. You can't say Jordan, the run-up wasn't convincing, but the finish at the bottom corner was, they hit a right inside the side net. Jordan Pickford gambles, you just can't save it, can't save it, right in the bottom corner, so much against the run-up play, it's frightening. How this game is 1-1, I cannot believe, it's a great pair, Jordan Pickford actually got a hand to it, nearly kept it out. When you look at the replay, Keoh-Walt has dis-hit the guard, but there's no intent. Tunisia won, England won, and that's put a dampener on things for England. Unbelievable, what a game football is. And now it's a worry for England, having had such a good opening half hour, 35 minutes played now, Kane wins ahead just outside the penalty area, I think he was caught there, Harry Kane, he's OK, climbs to his feet, he's holding his right hip, his lower back, he's OK, Kane, no, he's on his feet. Tunisia have possession deep inside their own half. So England, the dominant force over the course of the first half hour and more, the peg back by that penalty, that's almost a freak moment really. I mean, nobody's headed it, has it? He's went to jump, Keoh-Walt has tried to sort of block him off slightly, which happens in the game. Could Keoh-Walt have went ahead of it, he didn't really need to, we thought, so he's just probably got to push them away. His arm swings down, catches him, he's gone down. And so we have a score, line of Tunisia won, England won, can't believe it's 1-1. So England have to start again, and that's a poor ball from Harry Maguire, nowhere near Walker, and now it'll be taken on by Slitty, and he's going to use Kasere, who slips at the crucial moment, Kasere, and England can break away on the counter attack. Ali, just inside his own half, plays it to Sterling on the left-hand side, Sterling's mortaring now, he has options as well, and he plays it forward for the angled run, but he's all but hit it through for a goal kick. I'm certain it gives you so much, you think, well, this is going to be it, right there, he's all but run it, it's gone out of play. It's been court position three or four times already, it's Mr Sitter, you've got to step up to the level, he's got to start taking his chances, he's got to look after the ball a lot better. Right, him Sterling, Kyle Walker, you know, had made a run, almost into the opposition right back area to receive that pass, and Sterling got it all wrong. Tunisia won, England won, and England just wobbling a little here after conceding the equaliser, I mean, they must be kicking themselves, they'll know it as well as anyone. Here Sterling now down the left-hand side, he's challenged by Bronn, that was a little heavy from Bronn, and it is a free kick to England in the right back position. That's a little bit better by Sterling, gets his back into him, so he's earned a foul in a great position. We've saw already England so dominant in their pieces, this is a great opportunity now again. BBC Five Live, live here in Volgograd, in this futuristic stadium with the flashing lights and the latticework around the outside, and on the inside it looks as though England might be about to make a change, Fabian Delph is stripped off and ready for action, so someone has got a problem. Is it Deli Alley? Deli Alley, I'll in guard, it's one of them. Deli Alley's just flexing his right leg on the edge of the six yard box. But England have got a set piece here, and they're not going to make the change before it. This is a worry, Henderson makes a run to the near post, the ball is delivered across towards the back post, it's headed down and across, a little flick by Deli Alley, it hits the crossbar, it took down, it's turned goalwards, and John Stones has shanked it, he sliced it horribly, it landed in front of him six yards out, he took a swing at it, and he hit it almost sideways. I'll probably work on the system, which is working, oh there's a VAR call here, we're seeing on our screen, they are checking for a potential penalty, a potential foul in the incident there, now check over, the check is over, are we going to see, I mean it was mayhem, it was a scramble inside the penalty area, and the VAR officials are happy clearly that there was not a foul in there, they've checked it, there's no foul, and the score remains, Tunisia won, England won, chance for John Stones. You know what, they've worked on the shape, they've worked on possession, they've worked on set pieces, they obviously haven't been working on finishing enough, because the multi-chances, Harry Kane looking at the pictures, I'm saying here, I mean the check for that, Harry Kane has hauled all that inside the penalty area. We've just saw replay, what they see, why they not give it. I'm not sure they were looking for that. The referees have taught a lot of rubbish, when you were taught here before the tournament, absolute rubbish they taught. Chris, as Jesse Lingard, he shrugged off the ball and he's fouled and it's a free kick forward at the centre circle, the score is 1-1. I'll tell you, I sat in that briefing for an hour and a half, and one of the examples that we were shown, that the referees said, Pierre Luigi Collina said, that they would clamp down on was exactly what we've just seen here on the replay, with Harry Kane being wrestled to the ground by a defender, they said, that will be given as a penalty. Well the taught rubbish as usual, don't they? You know what, they say things and they never do it, and you know what, why do they have all these meetings in what they're going to do, cut down on dive and cut down, they never cut down on anything, nothing. Tunisia won, England won, we're into the last five minutes of the first half and it's in the balance, it shouldn't be. It's a free kick for England, this very high Tunisian line, they've actually brought everyone back. Everyone is in their own defensive third for Tunisia to defend this set piece, just drop it in behind, just drop it in behind. It's taken short, Trippie then lifts it into the penalty area, stretching header away by Siam Ben-Yusuf, bounces down into the right back area where Tunisia tried to win a throw-in or a corner off Delhi Ali, doesn't bounce out of play, Delhi Ali puts in the challenge, it is kept in, still inside the Tunisian penalty area and it will be cleared away or it should be cleared away by Skiri, actually plays a short pass and they win themselves a throw-in. They don't take risks, they're very brave on the ball, they believe in looking after the ball, so tight areas as well. Well that's what we've seen from them isn't it, in those warm-up matches. They take all the risks they take. They were 2-0 down to Portugal in one of their warm-up games, in the build-up to this World Cup, came back to draw 2-2, Turkey, one of the better sides that aren't at this World Cup, 2-2 draw with them and actually they had their chances to beat Spain, they're a little unfortunate in that match to lose 1-0. Put the ball in the box, put the ball back in the box again, free-kick, Young is fouled and a free-kick. Out here on the left-hand side, just a short distance away from where Tunisian coach Abel Malul is shepherding his side, string of instructions and again we see this Tunisian backline holding its line well outside of the penalty area. Trippier has come across, again just as Chris said, the idea will be that he just drops it in over the defensive line on the edge of the penalty area. Harry Kane waiting on the far side of the D, just keep an eye on him, here's the delivery, it's flicked on by Henderson into the penalty area, not it down, Lingard with a chance, left-foot shot deflected over the top from 14 yards, corner. I'm not sure I was going over the top to start with, whether I did deflection or not. The mountain chances England have carved out, set pieces, put every ball in the box, they win every, I don't mean queers, they win every one, that mate had been on target, but another chance. Five-live from the BBC, and England with a corner, Ashley Young to deliver from the left-hand side, right-footed and in-swinger. Ashley Young, the oldest man in the squad, preferred to Danny Rose to start the World Cup campaign here. Young, the referee is just keeping an eye on the movement inside the box, here's the delivery from Young, it's a deep one towards the far side of the penalty area, Harry Maguire's ended up on the ground, it's taken on round the outside by Trippier on the right-hand side, swings it into the six-yard box, but it's safely caught by goalkeeper Ben Mustafa. Trippier did very well, you know, he'd get the ball in, if somebody gambles in the opposite, they've got a little flick and it's a tap in, it's a goal. The delivery from goalkeeper Ben Mustafa was like an invitation for England to start another attack, he just landed it to Harry Maguire in the centre circle, like nowhere near it. That's like a goalkeeper in your junior school kick. He apologised to his team-mates, so I think had a look at him and gave him the chinisian, are you serious? In, ball forward, ball towards Lingard, Lingard puts it past the keeper, it hits, the post and bounces out! Oh goodness me, Lingard again, he could have had a hat-trick in the first half, just a long ball over the top from the right-hand side for Lingard to chase, he was cleaned through, just a little touch past Ben Mustafa, rolling goal-wets, it struck the outside of the post and bounced wide. I don't know, he's tracking him, give the goalie a little bit of credit, he put Lingard off slightly, forced the issue, he lifts it over him, and we all think it's just going to trickle into the net or hit the post and come back to him, it hits the post and goes out of play. That's 12 shots, England have had, five on target, this game should be history. However, it's chinisia 1, England 1, Harry Kane giving England the lead with their first goal at this World Cup after a John Storn's header was saved, Kane scored in the six-yard box, that was in the 11th minute, and then England chances coming and going on a regular basis before Kyle Walker with the flailing arm, and the court Ben Youssef in the box, penalty given, scored by Sarsie, and it's 1-1, that was in the 35th minute. Why do all the chances not fall out of Kane? He's only had the one chance, that's actually sorry, there was another shot that was deflected right. Here now in the penalty area, Stirling, long ball tried to take it on, but slipped as he did so, not able to do that, and so chinisia, three minutes of added time being played at the end of the first half here, on this beautifully warm evening, thankfully fly free up here in the commentary position, how on earth the Russians have done that? Well, I suspect several thousand tonnes of insecticide has probably played a part in it, not a few people have said that about Russians. Well, careful, we won't get taken off the air. Ashley Young plays it back towards Pickford in the penalty area, Pickford passes it out to Jordan Henderson who drops it deep, the two Sunderland boys there, and Henderson has played it wide to Pickford, and Pickford in the full back position has been unable to keep it in play with his ball downfield. Two wayciders on the wrong wavelength, Henderson and Pickford together there, actually quite a number of Sunderland flags have seen around the stadium, presumably supporting the two Sunderland boys, Wabi Kazary, a Sunderland player in the opposing team. Here is goalkeeper Ben Mustafa, long ball from him, and again he's given possession straight back to England and Harry Maguire. 90 seconds to play at the end of this first half, Henderson to the right hand side to Trippie, Trippie has ball forward, he's blocked back to him, a little awkward, he had to be careful, and Tunisian player is down on the far side, it's left back, Marlul. I'm already sensing Tristan that you're becoming increasingly exasperated with the way players are going down at this World Cup. Why doesn't the referee say, just say play on, I bet he gets up, he's had a ball from three yards which hit him on the side, his leg hit, and he's gone down, look, only stomach, oh, it's only stomach, that's where they should use that V-E-R, catch him out, off, 10 game ban. Can't use it for that unfortunately, the yellow card. This should start using it, make an order back, next time we go to the referee's briefing, I'll say, excuse me, Chris Waddle says, Tunisia won, England won. Tunisia back in possession, is Marlul okay, Chris, is he back up? Oh yeah, look, he is, he's alright. A nation, it's easy Tunisia, and England, they will be kicking themselves. I mean what will the message be at half time from Gareth Southgate? What the ball in it? Wow, I've never seen, honestly, the chances have got, at this level of football, this game honestly, it should be five. I said this to you, when we were sitting at Allent Road, watching them against Costa Rica, I'm not saying to you, should England be worried about the fact they're not putting teams away? Well, it can't fault the performance, it'd be an excellent, create chances on, there's another one, fell down. Well, half time, the whistle's gone. It's on, the mosquito ran into him. Half time, England should be out of sight, however, it's one-one Chris. Very frustrating, this game should be put to bed, now we should be going in and saying I can make three changes and rest players if I want to, should be game over. How are they backing the game, I can't believe. But it's not, here in Volgograd, Tunisia won, England won, and it's back to Moscow. No, we were talking about this afternoon, weren't we Chris, that match in Marseille, but the second half gets underway here in Russia in 2018, with Tunisia kicking off. There are no further changes at half time, so the Tunisia team, the substitute goalkeeper Ben Mustafa, the back four of Bron, Siam, Ben Yousaf, Maria and Marlul, in midfield, Skiri and Sarsi, the goal scorer Sarsi from the penalty spot, Badri and Ben Yousaf, Fakradin Ben Yousaf in the wide areas, and Slitty behind Kazary, although there's been good movement actually on the occasions that they have come forward. And the England team are running through you in a moment again, in fact I do it now as the ball goes back to Pickford, he's the goalkeeper, Walker Stonze and Maguire, Trippier and Jung, Henderson Lingard, Alley, Sterling and goal scorer Harry Kane. And I wondered about Delhi Alley at half time because Fabian Delft was being prepared at one stage, but Alley obviously OK to come out and begin the second half. So in this second period Tunisia in the almost all-white kit with the red trim, red numbers, red names against England in the almost red kit. And Tunisia playing from right to left as we look here, they play it back into their own half to Yasin Maria. And so England, Chris Waddle, the order of the day is now, so it's a play like you did first half and you currently chances to take them and that's the key. They've played ever so well, I kind of felt the performance at all. They haven't come out with that intensity they started the game with. If you look at them, they've got the shape, what they're letting Tunisia have the ball, growing confidence. I thought the first 10 minutes, get after them, go and get the ball off them. There will be a 6-0-6 on 5-Live tonight, Kelly Cates is hosting it from Moscow along with Terry Butcher. We'll let you know when the lines are open, but obviously you can get in touch on social media and tell us what you think of this performance tonight. And all of the issues at 5-Live Sport or at BBC 6-0-6, you can text 85058. But England now has a foul on Jordan Henderson, just stretching for the ball, possibly over-stretching, but he's okay. He sits on the pitch and now gets to his feet. So a free kick for England, halfway inside the England half. The England supporters, the band, you can hear them probably are here. It's a wide open concourse all the way around between the lower tier and the top tier and I can see people milling around in there. And the attendance will be between 40 and 45,000 inside this modern, this brand new arena here in the city of Volgograd. And you're saying Chris that Slitty has gone up alongside Cazerik. Yep, they've gone 4-4-2. They must have thought England were getting too much possession at the back and starting too many moves off. So they've gone 4-4-2. Tactical change, remember? The back, they've gone 5 at the back, sorry, 3 at the back. They have, and remember that's what Nigeria did against England. They've gone shape for shape. And England, in that match at Wembley, in the penultimate World Cup warm-up, actually took a little while to get used to that. The opposition change of formation. Here is Slitty who wins a throw-in on the far side for Tunisia. He's had to change at the manager because, let's be honest, England really embarrassed them at times first off. Tunisia couldn't get near England. So they thought we're going to basically go shape for shape anyway. You've got to say so far it's early in the second half, but Tunisia's dominating the possession. Chris Waddle with us on 5-5, played it. Two World Cups for England, 62 caps. Tunisia have conceded possession. Cheekley-Maria has just chipped it out of play on the half-way line, throwing to England. That is going to be taken by Kieran Tripp yet. Close quarters to Jesse Lingard who should have scored at least one goal in the first half. And there's a poor pass from Henderson, straight out of play. No, they've just not got the intensity here. Yeah, they started the game ever so well, didn't they? They had two chances probably in the first five minutes and so far it's Tunisia who's slowing the game. Controlling the pace of the game, England haven't come out very quickly with the traps and that's definitely suit Tunisia. Throw in. For the highest ranked African team in the world currently, Tunisia. They get the ball back on the left-hand side. It's chipped forward by Ali Malul and now Badri gets the ball caught up underneath his feet. England are pressing here, Lingard and Sterling but Tunisia are able to play it out towards the right-hand side where it's carried forward towards the half-way line by Braun. Now Skiri, Alies Skiri in centre midfield. Up towards the half-way line where Slithy turns away from Lingard, plays it forward and claims he was fouled. The referee waves play on, Kasri's taking it down the left-hand side onto his right foot. Potentially dangerous for England but then he gives possession away very cheaply. Kane to Sterling, Sterling plays it past his man, Sterling now, defenders coming back into position and Sterling has to, well he tried actually to slip a little ball through towards Lingard and then it's back towards Ben Mustafar the goalkeeper at pace coming out of his six-yard box to his left and he could only slice it behind for a corner. Well it's sort of, I mean Sterling here, he deserves a so-called get on the ball and use his pace to get in the, deep in the Tunisian half and he's got to get his head up and put his foot on the ball and pass it to a red shirt. That's what England want though, players like Sterling running at the opposition defenders in dangerous areas. It should be to take this corner from the right-hand side. England have lined up four men almost in a line beyond the penalty spot. Four defenders there with him in Tunisian white. The referee, who rolled down, has got his eyes on this. Here's the deliveryer from Trippia and it's headed goal, went straight at the key back. He was just able to readjust and move to his right in amongst, the header coming in from in amongst a crowd of players as the balls launched downfield and Pickford has able to collect it quite comfortably. And again, the replay show that in amongst that crowd Harry Kane was, I mean, manhandled to the ground again. I just don't get it, that's two in a row with Soin. There's still nothing happens, look at the other one, I've not even looked at this one. So England have to start again from the back. I can't stress enough how strongly they worded it in the referee's briefing for the media that they would take action against grappling in the penalty areas and if they needed to give penalties, penalties would be given. It was doing all the talking, Pinocchio, Pierre Lourige. It wasn't far off then. No. Chinnesia with the ball inside their own half. The score, Chinnesia won, England won. Lots to be positive about for England in the first half, they took the lead, he has picked it outside of his downfield, the offside flag is up, scary moment. Pickford came out, didn't get there and Kasry was able to take it on but he was in an offside position. Harry Kane scored early in the match in the 11th minute, great start for England, just what they wanted. Harry Kane, his 14th goal for England in his 25th appearance, that's becoming a very good strike rate at international level. And Chinnesia equalising though with the penalty that was conceded by Kyle Walcott, the flailing arm that was picked up by the referee and Ferjani Sasi scored that to make it 1-1. But England so many chances in the first half, we heard that welter of statistics that Mark Chapman mentioned. And England now trying to edge themselves back and front here in the World Cup opener for these two teams. Sterling deflected the ball to Alley, now to the left-hand side, Young's ball across Pruitt, there were three options for him in the middle but he did straight up one of the defenders who cleared it away and then a foul on the half-way line by Kasry on McWire, Mr Freek. Well, asked the young, first ball he's put him on his left foot, wasn't the best, cleared. Sterling did well, little check. Anxious time sees at the start of the second half, still in the first ten minutes of the second period. Next with England, we go to Nishni Novgorod, which is also on the Volga River, for the game against Panama and then to Kaliningrad, right out back to the west, that's the most western venue for the game against Belgium. England desperately want to start with a win here and they've had enough chances already to have secured that, but it is still level at 1-1, now a touch on the edge of the area, comes back to Harry Kane, Kane out to the left-hand side into the full-back position, the challenge came in on him, it was a good one as well, just took the ball away from him, Badri it was who put it in and Genizia, clear poorly to Harry McWire and Harry McWire is going on, one of those McWire wonders into the left-back position, pulls the cross over the touch in the middle, though controlled it from Siam Ben-Yusuf, who was able to recover and clear it away. And now it's back to Ben Mostafa, who again looking not the most confident with the ball at his feet, plays the ball out and Genizia having to play it away from the back, but in danger of losing possession, Lingard got a touch, Genizia still have it, they're taking some risks here, Badri playing it out to the right-hand side, this is great pressing from England though, it must be said and it's deflected out of play for Thorenta Genizia on the far side. Great, great way John, press is great, gives Genizia a little bit of credit there, very brave in areas where normally nobody would pass the ball or play, there he did, throw in, one-one, lines will be open for 606, when I tell you, he has Kane through the middle, the bouncing ball runs away from him and Siam Ben-Yusuf is able to turn it up the right-hand side and this is going to be taken on by Bronn, but Bronn's ball forward is nowhere near Kasry and England have got it at the back. Thousands and thousands of Genizian supporters here coming to see their first match, their team's first match at the World Cup for 12 years, so great occasion for them, not one again since the very first match against Mexico back at Argentina in 1978, it would be a thing to behold for those Genizian fans, many of them wearing the little red fezzes on top of their heads, dotted around the stadium here and the ball bouncing through for a goal kick to Genizia in England. Haven't really got into that strike yet in the second half? No, we've said before, it's about 90 minutes managing it, it's hard to play the tempo, England played first half, they really did, the dressing was absolutely brilliant and now the feeling of play slightly, they've come off it, Genizia obviously changed their shape, which has caused England a little bit of a problem. It has, Maguire towards Henderson, this is still inside England territory and Maguire turns and plays it back to Pickford, who had to be quick but he was and under pressure from Cazares, just launched it left footed away downfield, where it bounces through the goalkeeper, then Mustafa, so again it will be Genizia to start from the back, number of substitutes are warming up there, Damdwell are right not far away from where Rachel Burden is watching, Marcus Rashford is one of them, here's Harry Kane, Kane now just waits and waits and then slips the pass down into the full back position for Henderson, Henderson pulls it across towards the back post, Deli Alley was struggling there really, tried to pull it down as he was running in at pace and actually I'm not sure he got a touch on it, Lingard stretching forward for the referee, giving the free kick from Cazares, initial foul on Cazares, taken quickly by Genizia, getting the ball back in play on this sultry night. They like the hole and Globetrotters aren't at Genizia, it's the risk, the play and it's exhibition stuff. Dangerous team, started poorly in this game, were hamstrung as well by the loss of the young goalkeeper Hassan who had to go off with a shoulder injury inside the first 15 minutes, they were already 1-0 down at that stage, but with the game as it is now, they've recovered well, they've made this change that Chris is talking about, changing to 3 at the back from the 4, Long ball forward now, the Trivia's underneath it and is able to head it back into his penalty area for Jordan Pickford, to actually pick up the ball. Pickford is looking to ball it out there and he underarms it to his right, to Walker. Henderson, now England playing it across the back line to Stones, Stones, he should have scored in the first half as well, couple of opportunities, one I mean a magnificent save from the young goalkeeper when Harry Kane opened the scoring, just popped it in in the 6 yard box when it fell to him from the save, but he had another chance as well, John Stones, but as we were saying, half the players out there in the England team have had chances in this game. Now he has Lingard, Lingard cutting in from the left hand side, drips fast 1 challenge, little touch into the penalty area, that Harry Kane isn't able to, it doesn't stick for Kane as the challenge came in on him, so Genizia, partly Kier, is still very closely challenged, goes down in a heap and actually stands up, the referee is right there, just a little bit of afters there, involving Sarsie and Sterling, England are still in possession in the central third of the pitch, Henderson, angle pass through the middle towards Lingard, Kane in a deeper line position through to Sterling on the edge of the penalty area, Sterling, challenges coming on him from two sides, just got it caught underneath his feet, clearance is affected, back to England again and they are just building the momentum here again, England, parked inside the Tunisian half, 1-1 the score, Lingard, little touch out towards his club mate Ashley Young on the far side of the field, back it comes to McGuire, now he has Kyle Walker, part of this all Yorkshire England three man back line, stones to Trippier on the right hand side, Trippier has two men on it, he uses John Stones, who swirls in a pass towards the back post that is headed away, Sterling though, nods it back to Young, Young's on his right foot, turns onto his left, towards the byline, then the challenge comes in on him and it's deflected out of play, good pressure by England, just look at that quality cross, quality shot, can he get into that chance? So in taken quickly, England putting some pressure on Tunisian now, back it goes towards Lingard and he returns it towards the half byline, Henderson now with a cross field ball, Diagonal, Trippier takes it down inside the penalty area and the cross is deflected wider than the post and behind for an England corner. Great ball by John Endersen wasn't he, just rocked ten yards over the half wheel end, just left the centre, he hit Diagonal right in the feet of Trippier, wonderful, he should do that more. One of his trademarks though isn't it, taking it like that, it shades of Gerard the way that he does that, the man he succeeded, there's the Liverpool captain, so again we see this line up Chris for the corner here, actually Markin now, the Wasone, now the Markin, we've got a group of four England players in Fortinice please, let's just keep an eye on it Chris, on Harry Kane in particular, they know that the danger is great from him, Trippier takes the corner, it's headed, goal weds, another hit kick by Kane as he peeled away but he was kicking it back from the dead ball line and Tunisian were able to scramble it away towards the half byline, he managed to actually escape it there didn't he, he took on a position at the back post Harry Kane, pulled into the penalty area, make a sterling but that's cleared away, I don't think Tunisian in the last 10 minutes have got high out the field in 25 yards, no, out of their own defence of third and then Stirling has picked up for a little tug and it's a free kick to Tunisian, the lines are open for 606 but how that develops with Kelly Cates and Terry Butcher in Moscow when we'll be taking your calls on 08, 08, 5, 9, 0, 9, 6, 9, 3 depends on what happens in the next half hour, that's how long there is to play given the added time that there will be at the end of the match, so 08, 08, 5, 9, 0, 9, 6, 9, 3, text on 85058, get in touch at DVC 606, at Five Live Sport if you use social media as well, every morning when you can wake up you can download the Five Live World Cup daily podcast and tomorrow it'll feature all the reaction to this match, we will be speaking live with Gareth Southgate from downstairs in the stadium after the match here, that will appear in 606, England with a ball and a throw in deep inside the road, Chris Rock. I just think it needs freshening up, we've got decent possession England, the tempo is not real, Daly Ali Lingard, I'm not in the game at the minute, it's all down to Sterling who's given the ball away a lot of times where he should look after it, Kane overseas there, the main threat, but I may be looking at it, could he get Rashford off his cheek on, maybe just to freshen it up. Tunisia under pressure, balls played all the way back to Ben Mostafa, slides out of his penalty area, he's petrified about Raheem Sterling's pace, Ben Mostafa and so back it goes to England, Young, higher ball this time over the top, it's not in the field by Daly Ali, but behind Sterling and Lario is able to come across and clear it away. England dominating possession now, but still a scoreline of 1-1, anxious moments here, Henderson plays it to the left hand side, dominating possession, dominating the play, not creating much. Not creating any chances though, a lot like first off where it was shooting in time for them but they couldn't score, so... Henderson's lumb or four, asking a lot of Lingard and he can't keep it in play and it's behind for a goal kick. This is where you can look at it now and say, has somebody come off the pace, how can I change it a little bit? How can I change this, Daly Ali's not at a touch second off, and Lingard hasn't really made many runs forward, so whether they're feeling the hits, the pace of the game, it's caught up with them, but it's up the guard itself, obviously it's changing, but I'll be looking to get some fresh legs on going forward. And well done to you Chris, I suspect that was the first time the phrase should be in time, has ever been used in Volgograd. Poor clearance from Ben Mostafa, now here's Harry Kane, he was being tugged, he shrugged it off, plays it forward to Sterling, he runs down into the full back position, Sterling evades his man, little piece of trickery, then a back heel to Jung, but Jung is unable to get there and he's actually blocked by Ben Youssef who wins a free kick. That's what frustrates you at Ryan Sterling, unbelievable pace, goes past his first man, careless, loose back heel, gives away a possession, gives away a free kick when England are high up the field, asking questions, again he gives them all away. It was one of the debates wasn't it, Rashford or Sterling, he's not had a great night Sterling. No he hasn't, he gives the ball away too much and obviously in front of goal he's missed a couple of really good chances. Not scored for England, for Alfa, well over two and a half years Raheem Sterling, just had the goal scoring season of his career with Manchester City. I felt watching him for England that the goals are coming, Sterling involved near the half-way line, Deli Ali as well, now Henderson on the left hand side, Henderson's influence actually is growing in this game, another pool captain, and here he is again in possession, turned 28 yesterday, Henderson says, you know where's the movement there and he has to play the ball back towards the half-way line, to John Stones who puts his foot on the ball, plays it square to Walker, Walker's going to have a little foray forward and now Trippier on the right hand side, Walker's continued his run, Stones back to Trippier and actually they have to go back to Pickford. Still the England substitutes are warming up down there, to the right not far away from where Rachel Burden is standing behind the goal, where all of the England flags are draped over the middle tier of the stand. At the moment the score is 1-1 and Kyle Walker with 25 minutes to play, Walker takes it on, half-way inside the Tunisian half, Lindgard stands up to the challenge that comes in on him from Skiri, takes it all the way back towards the half-way line, is trying to start a Mexican wave now, Harry Maguire's bringing it forward, Maguire to the edge of the D, thought about a shot I think, but actually curls the pass to the right hand side to Trippier, now back towards Henderson, he clips it in teasingly to the back post, Maguire closes to it, but as he stretched for it, it just bounced beyond him and threw for goal, it just seems to be the same players, John Henderson is really involved, he's on the really good game, John Henderson and Harry Maguire making his runs forward with John Stones, and I'm just looking to think what can we get any more from Sterling, Lindgard and Alley, they've just sort of gone out the game. The referee is talking with one of the Tunisian central defenders, they've got a man off the field actually down here, Kazry, just as he's receiving some treatment, he was a little bit of a doubt remember, Kazry, he did carry an injury into the World Cup, didn't play in the warm-up matches, I think they've repaired him, they've strapped him up, and he's back on the field, and that wave now is making its way around the stadium. 11, 5-live, lines open for 6-0-6 to talk to Terry Butcher and Kelly Cates who will be in Moscow to reflect on this match and what happens in the remainder of it, and England now are going to make a change, and it is Marcus Rashford Chris, I think that was almost inevitable that Rashford would be introduced. He played in that last friendly against Cotter, he was brilliant that night, and if you can play like that and get his shooting boots on, but you did that night, England got the win again. 11, Rashford about to be introduced for his World Cup debut, almost midway through the first half year, England winning another free kick, Harry Kane plays it forward, an awkward ball, but Sterling's done well, plays it infield, Young run to the edge of the area, slightly behind him, Kane is then challenged, and goes down, he was caught on the shins, and the free kick is given England's way, left of centre, 25 yards out, and before the free kick is taken, Raheem Sterling is going to be replaced by Marcus Rashford. Well I can see that Sterling, not the best game, he's obviously a threat with his pace, but he's given the ball away so much for me today, another look after it, and now I'll get Rashford on, now I'll take the free kick even, and so, into the action comes England's number 19, 20 year old Marcus Rashford, this Manchester lad making his World Cup debut, his first appearance at the World Cup finals, his 20th cap for England, he's not going to take the free kick, it's Trippier, it's Trippier who's going to take it, he's been the man that England have designated, that's not 10 yards now by the way, the Tunisian wall, which is, well the white line is there, it's about 30 in that wall at the minute, most of the Tunisian team are in the wall, left of centre, Kieran Trippier took 10 yards, he told me a couple of weeks ago he's only ever scored, he said something like 5 free kicks in his entire career, Trippier with the free kick, it's over the wall and it bounces wide by a yard. Why didn't Marcus Rashford take it, we've seen him take free kicks, he's very good at them, I don't know, that's gone a couple of yards away, I don't think it was ever going to trouble, no pace on it, it's funny isn't it, first half England were really outstanding I thought, putting the ball in the net, and this second half have really struggled and they've changed the system, which England is going to come up across a lot of teams will do this. And now Rashford playing it rather more up front alongside Kane than Stirling was, Kane got a touch to Rashford, here's his first touch, sets off, beats his man, plays it through, they came on the edge of the penalty area, important challenge, good one actually from Bron the right back who just came in with a tackle, timed it well on Harry Kane on the edge of the area and the ball ran through to goalkeeper Ben Mostafa. Tunisia won, England won. I've got to say, I don't know what people think when they'll probably ring in, whatever, but Tunisia are terrible, they are terrible. You thought that we're going to be better than this? I was expecting really a talented side who looked after the ball and moved it on where we couldn't get it off them. Stones, we were saying the same thing about opponents, Russia, two years ago in England's opening match at Euro 2016, England didn't win that game, back to Young, Young now to Henderson, Henderson lifts it into the penalty area, bounces through, Deli Alli was almost in, but the offside flag was up in any case and the goalkeepers gathered it. Good football, first time we saw Deli Alli second half, let's be honest, but these are for the taken, John these are the ones you win games mate, these are a game which Tunisia cannot live with England, I can't remember being in the, I can't remember being over half, we're late second half. But England have created relatively little at the other end, however Rashford's on the field now, I will say what difference that makes. England if you didn't hear in the first half, I don't know where you've been, as Harry Kane is challenged, ends up down on the ground with no free kick, Tunisia have got it back, and this time it's Lingard doing the pressing, and clearance, an unconvincing clearance from Maria, and now Badre has to play it back to Maria again, Mar-Lual passes it in field, and there's a touch square from Skiri, and now I think Tunisia will cross the halfway line, here's one for Kazry to chase, he's all on his own, he's on the right side of the area, he shoots from the angle, but it was blocked at source almost by John Stones, kept in play on the far side, kept in play, Sasi, the Tunisian goal scorer from the penalty spot in the first half, it's one-one at half time, still one-one, now England just standing off, and the shot is poor really, from the central area, from Slitty, well-wide by several of the guys. Kazry, great run by Kazry, went by the shot early, good block by Stones, that's the only check we've had that second half, it's been all England. There are just over 41,000 people inside the stadium with us here in Volgograd, 41,064, so around about 4,000 empty seats. Great event this for Volgograd, as Kane heads the ball on through the middle, Rashford is chasing, and it's hooked away, cleared away by Bron on the edge of the box, comes back for England, Maguire, thousands of the spectators putting the lights on on their mobile phones, ball up towards Delhi Ali, a touch from Lingard, now Rashford sets off, beats his man brilliantly, Rashford to the edge of the penalty area, tried to lay it into the path of Delhi Ali, just, just got it inches wrong, and so Tunisia were able to play back to goalkeeper Ben Mustafa. And bringing actually a forward on Tunisia, yeah. England will it on the left-hand side. Rashford has definitely lifted the England performance here. Young concedes a foul in the full back position, and it's a free kick to Tunisia. It is the change, this is the second Tunisian change, remember? It's Slitty who's making way, and actually, I'm in the substitute who's coming onto the field, and Mohamed Amin Ban Amma is a defensive midfielder who is coming on, who's very much apart of the qualifying campaign, but with the changes that the coach, Nabil Malou, has made, brought in a number of players, the French-born players, he's ended up being only a substitute for the first World Cup match, and he, the number 14, is taking a position right in front of his back line. They're clinging on here for this draw, they may get the odd counter-attack, which they don't deserve anything, let's be honest, they've been terrible, I think, but they're clinging on, they're going to say a draw will be a massive, massive result in the right. 1-1 remains the score. England still have two changes they could make, got just under 20 minutes to play. 5-5 from the BBC, as Tunisia present possession back to England yet again, stones, receives it, once more stones forward towards Maguire, who might go on another wonder here, because space is opened up in front of him, he does so, crosses the halfway line, gives it to his left, to Ashley Young, Young, little touch in field, Rashford has dropped deep, and in fact Lingard has a speed, Lingard's the furthest forward of the England players, Harry Kane drops deep as well, pass driven forward by Walker, it's missed by one defender, but runs through harmlessly for a goal kick, Lingard on the chase, but couldn't get there. Can he get Loftus' cheek on, maybe fresh legs on the ball, Lingard for me is feeling the pace, and Delhi Ali's a cat in touch in the ball hardly second off. Well he did, we thought he was going to be replaced, at the end of the, you know, the first half, Delph was ready to come on, and Delhi Ali obviously then indicated he was OK. I can see the top of Gareth Southgate's head just in front of the blue top of the England dugout, whether they are thinking about another change in there, not sure whether there's any movement, the ball deflects out of play, Trippier is going to take base, the score remains 1-1, Henderson, back towards Trippier. Actually John, you could put Rashford as a number 10, and you could put Jamie Vardy in front. These are not going to come out, look they've got a back line of 28 now. You can only have 23 in the squad, Jung plays it up the left hand side, and Delhi Ali though, on his heels wasn't able to get there, the defender came forward, and now Chin is yet passing it away towards the half way line, that's an awful pass, straight out of play from Badre, throwing to England. You know, if England do not win this match, please, it will be a huge disappointment. Oh, Walker, to McGuire on the left hand side, now Ashley Young, 15 minutes to play, time is beginning to run out, and it's still 1-1, Panama and Belgium to play, Belgium getting underway with a 3-0 win against the Panamanians today. Trippier on the right hand side, Trippier twisting and turning, getting it to Rashford, Rashford now to Walker, Walker's ball across is easily cleared away, left footed on the edge of the 6 yard box, throwing that Trippier takes quickly, England's constant pressure continues, Trippier now towards Lingard, Lingard with a flick, Trippier, he has Walker available on the right hand side, he uses Rashford, Rashford takes a touch, goes round, Defender Maria then beats him for a second time, on his left foot, beats him again onto his right, still Rashford now back to Trippier, Trippier lifted in towards the back post, Kane stretching for it, tried to drag it back towards Lingard, he did so, but the defender nipped in to clear it. McGuire now, wave after wave of England attack. I'd say to Rashford, just down on his right wing, about 10 minutes, because you can't go through the middle, look at the 3, 4, 5 of them really close together, you've got to go away, you've got to get away and you've got to get him behind them, put balls in behind from the angles, from the width, the packed Tunisian defence, and as I'm looking now, it's a back line of 6 with 3 right in front of him, but England use Deli Alley, Henderson now, or Lingard goes down, he was shoved over on the edge of the penalty area, free kick to England, and he's given it actually for the initial challenge on Deli Alley just outside the D. This is a great position, this. Rashford on the field now, Trivia took the previous free kick, this is a little closer, actually England have moved it, it's going to be about a yard outside of the penalty area. Actually Young, but Rashford does as well, and Trivia, the 3 of them are talking about this, so it's 1-1 with England here at the World Cup, and with 12 and a half minutes to play, it looks as though it's going to be Ashley Young. Rashford's moved away to the right, and Trivia's talking to him and telling Rashford to take a position in the wall. He's got to hit it where the goal is standing, he's not going to get it up and over the way, hope he does, but just pace where the goal is standing, scored a brilliant free kick, remember this season against Watford, Ashley Young, it is quite close, it's 1-1, free kick time, can Ashley Young do her an Aldo? He waits one foot in front of the other, the referee's still not happy because actually Jordan Henderson and a couple of the Tunisians, and Henderson has some choice words, and Harry Kane is just trying to calm things down, the referee stepped away to let it just see its course, and now will speak to them, and still Ashley Young waits, still Ashley Young waits, what a delay, Young with a free kick over the wall, but over by a yard of the angle of post and bar to goal kick. You've got to go where they go, to get that up and over, yeah, Ronaldo may be able to do it, well there's not many can, but that's got to be where the goal is standing, a lot of pace, and if he spills it, it's a tap in. That is a tap in. Rashford could have taken it, and Harry Kane's a potential free kick taker. Yeah, exactly, why doesn't Harry Kane take it? England are now going to make the change, and it is Loftus Cheek, Chris, as you suggested it might be, and there's been no particular indication that Loftus Cheek was going to be used, but this is another big moment here, as Young Ruben Loftus Cheek, 22 years old, steps into the World Cup and pulls up his left sleeve, over his shoulder as Deli Alley sprints off the field, so it's Loftus Cheek on for Deli Alley. Yeah, good change, Deli Alley looked like he was busy said, he was carrying it into, now he got sucked first off, but second off hardly touched the ball, so Loftus Cheek on, so this Young England squad, Garry Southgate has brought on a couple of his youngsters, the 20 year old Rashford, the 22 year old Loftus Cheek, to see if they can swing this England's way, 10 minutes to play, slightly all that, that, and it's still 1-1. Looks so good for England in the first half, the early goal, all of the pressure, all of the chances, but they couldn't put them away, and then the penalty given for a flailing arm, a stray arm really, it was little more than that, but it did catch the Tunisian forward Ben Youssef, penalty was given, and 1-1 was the result, and it stayed like that, but England now with Loftus Cheek into the action, and free kicks given for the challenge on Jordan Henderson, just to drop. They're quite happy to keep giving silly free kicks away, slowly game, change the pace of the game, the momentum, and you know, it's all England, it's been England basically the old game, but they're quite happy to slow this game down, and just run the clock down, and we are now into the last 10 minutes of this match. Lines are open for 6-0-6, 0-8, 0-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. Well this is the highest line that Tunis Europe had to defend to set pace, the young plays over the top, towards the back post, I think Harry Maguire might have been being pulled there, but Maguire now challenging for the ball that's deflected out of play. Yes, you've got that right, the Linesman, but off Maguire for a Tunisian throw. Well they know for this, it's an unbelievable result for Tunisia, unbelievable. There is always the potential at 1-1, that it could be better than a draw for Tunisia. No, no, no, you've got to get over the half-wheeling first. Tunisia with Ben Amma, showing no ambition at all. Ben Amma had a little look forward towards Qasri, it's been like a spectator Qasri in the second half. He's been standing tall to the coach most of the game. He actually came and had a drink of a water bottle at one stage, when the ball and England were parked downfield. This would be a big, big disappointment if England can't get over the line here, it's 1-1. And the ball is played for Bronn, who does actually cross the halfway line for Tunisia, but England have one possession back and John Stones in that stately fashion plays it square to Trivia. And now Walker, Walker turns away and threads a pass out to the left-hand side to Ashley Young, and Young and forward now down the left-hand side, it's with Marcus Rashford, Loftus Cheekwaits in the middle, Rashford now cutting into the penalty area, goes towards the byline and looked to weave his way around the two defenders there, one of whom got a touch to put it behind for an England corner. Well, it was a good defender, he blocked the lane and Rashford, you could say it's a free kick, but he didn't, he got a corner out of it. Time running out, if England are going to win this opening match for them at this World Cup, Young to take the corner, right footed into the six yard box, goalkeeper Ben Yusuf, comes, gets a punch on it, and actually was challenged as he punched it, and the free kick's been given to Nizia's way, and both Ben Mustafa and John Stones, who put in the challenge, I mean Stones, got the worst of that, John Stones. He did, the goalkeeper punched the ball and also caught Stones with a follow through, but Stones is okay, he's back on his feet, he's caught by the goalkeeper's arm actually. They're really running on quick as well aren't they, Fizio and Wohaweba, Falk, Nizia. They've got Ben now, he's got his sandwich box for the pitch, Ben Mustafa, Nizia have already lost one goalkeeper in this match, I would doubt that Ben Mustafa would have to go off as well. No chance, it's just from the actual fact, Nizia are going to make the third change, regardless of the fact that their goalkeeper is down injured. Obviously the coach will win, I think he knows. I think one of his coaches is selling him, he's up, he's up, he's up. Yeah, he's going to be okay. Actually we've just seen a picture on our screen here of the Nizia goalkeeper who started the match, Muaz Hassan with his left arm in a sling, so that must be the end of his world cup, really feel for him, left the field in tears. And then Chinas Yeragoyan is going to make this final change, it's actually the captain, Kazra, who's off. And he's offered the captain's arm, he hasn't left the field yet because of the issue of who puts the captain's arm band on. So this is winding down the clock and still Sabah Khalifa is waiting to come on, he is a striker, 31 years old. And Kazra still hasn't left the field. He's given the left back. No he hasn't, he's just been congratulated by Marlul, he gave the captain's arm band, I think, to Skiri in the middle. Well that's a lengthy stoppage. The goalkeeper receiving treatment, the whole substitution. And now we're into the last five minutes, but there must be at least five minutes. And the rest. England being held to a 1-1 draw, and that is the correct phrase. The disappointment is that England haven't created more in the second half, but Chinas Yeragoyan changed their system at half time and it's been more difficult to break down. He went to straight at the back, well sometimes five at the back and England, you've got to say that England did come off the pace. You know the energy levels first half were far better than they were second half, which you expect. Rashford has lifted England though. Oh hi, you've got a free kick on the right England. He's got to be booked. Marlul who's not retreating, ten yards. Free kick, Trippie awaiting to take. Marlul is not ten yards away. What's the referee doing, look at him. And Trippie is saying that the left back is nowhere near ten yards away. Trippie plays the free kick in, headed away by the first defender. Marlul can't keep it in, Trippie is ready to take a quick throw, it bounce back off the advertising hoardings, takes it towards Walker. Ten yards inside the Chinas Yeragoyan half, goes to Lingard on the left hand side. Lingard has available, McGuire turns it back towards Ashley Young. No ambition whatsoever from Chinas Yeragoyan, they will take a point from this match and if they get more, well great. Lofter's cheek now down the right hand side crosses, it took a deflection and Ben Aama, a touch from here. A touch from him and now the new captain, Skiri, plays it to the fish. He's offside. He newly arrived, Khalifa, he was offside. He just three yards over the top and he was offside. More pressure, quick free kick. Just over three minutes to play, it's still one-one in England's opening match at this World Cup. Ashley Young plays it back towards the halfway line. Stones, squared, Walker, now to Trippie, Trippie has first time touch to Lofter's cheek, Lofter's cheek, beats to the vendor, plays it across, Rashford, dummied it. Lingard bounced away from him and that pack to Chinas Yeragoyan, penalty area, Skiri bit away downfield. I think he got a shot there, Rashford was going to hit that, I think Lingard's shouted. And then wasn't able to take advantage. Trippie are on the right-hand side again, back to Henderson. Henderson picks out the low pass to Lofter's cheek on the right who's made a promising start. Now Rashford turns into the penalty area, the challenge comes in on him and it takes the ball away from Rashford who wins it back. And then Lofter's cheek couldn't find Rashford with a flick and Chinas Yeragoyan might just be about to break downfield. And Khalifa is onside, Khalifa up against Walker, Walker shrugs him off the ball and plays it back towards Pickford. Just over two minutes to play. They can't get a breather, it's a wave after wave and the concentration's been good from them. Yeah, they've been really difficult to find a way through in the second half. When in the first half they were, I mean England were cutting through them at will, didn't take the chances. Sterling, Lingard, Stonys. You run out of fingers. Now that's an excellent turn by Lofter's cheek. Lofter's cheek into the full-back position, heading for the byline. Couldn't keep it in as he pulled it back on the stretch and it's a goal kick. He's got to hit it, John. You know when he did the lovely turn there, he got away from his man. That's when he had to hit it. He had the angle and everything. Just visit it across that six yard lane. Extra touch runs out of play. Well now Chris, it's a little like when you and I were watching the match. When we were having our lunch today, the Sweden, South Korea, when Sweden were one-nil up and we were saying, how many will they get another good chance South Korea? Yeah, they did. Same applies for England now. They'll get a chance. I like your thinking. One minute to play. Or Wilton, is he? I get a chance. Ball played forward towards Khalifa, but Walker does brilliantly against him. So quick, co-Walker. Too quick. And then Trippie and Nutmegs, Khalifa and Walker plays it across the penalty area to Stones. And England start from inside their own half. Well, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we're now in the 90th minute and it is Tunisia won, England won. And unless England can come up with a late winner, it's going to be a frustrating and, yes, disappointing start to England's World Cup campaign here in Russia. Rashford plays it back towards Stones. Let's just see. It's four minutes, you know. I think I've just seen on the... No way. I think I've just seen on the board that it's four minutes about a time. There's a zero after it. Here's Lingard. Lingard now to the edge of the penalty area. Trippie to take it around the outside. Loftus-Cheeks there, but that's a strong challenge that comes in on him from the newly arrived Ben Amma. And Ben Amma, I think, is conceded. Corner he has been put under pressure from Loftus-Cheeks. Why didn't he just play it down the lane? Kick it long. There's confirmation. Four minutes about it, Sam. Why are these officials... It's embarrassing. That is the... I mean, that's the bare minimum. I mean, that's actually... That's just wrong. One-one the score. 6-0-6 to follow. Corner. Trippie had to take it. And McQuaier with the header. It's not in it by Kane! Harry's done it for St George. He's won the opening match for England in Russia. He was there heading it in in the six yard box. Two-one England. That's what they deserve. And we kept thinking, will Harry Kane get another chance to the game? And he did. And I'm glad it's fell to him in far post. Again his set piece. Flicked on. Is it McQuaier who gets up? And he heads it across. There's nobody, Mark Kane. He's lost his margarh. He heads it straight on the target into the roof. And he's got to say, England thoroughly deserved this win. I mean, how Harry Kane managed to get into a position in the six yard box where he was all alone. I mean, clever, really. He just found that position for himself. And it's Tunisia won England 2, everyone. Kane and NERF. Exactly. The way they deserve it, listen, it should have been 6, never made it 2. And now, I think four minutes is about right. Don't you think? I would say 30 seconds, maybe personally. We've got to give some to England. The officials have given them nothing. Well, we still care of Southgate. It's a brilliant reaction. I think he almost did a Sergei Bucca at the Southgate. He jumped so high without the assistance of a pole. And England are going to make a change. And guess what? England are in no hurry to make it. It's Jesse Lingard leaving the field. Well, I mean, it's so different to two years ago in that ill-fated campaign in France when the opening match, when England were frustrated by Russia. And here, it's England who've come up with a late goal. In the first minute of added time, Harry Kane's second goal of the match. The captain has delivered. And Eric Dyer's coming on for the final moments of this match. No slips now, England. As Tunisia hump it forward down the middle for Khalifa, who's going to chase it. The bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area, Henderson comes across and is able to lift it out of play. I'll make it, we've got a minute and 15 seconds to play. Two-one England lead. Now, that's a nice little change of feet by Badry on the left-hand side, but he's overrun it through for a goal kick. And obviously England, Jordan Pickford will be in no hurry to take this Chris Waddle. Slow it right down. No rush at all there. The clock run out. The fury deserved it. I hope this day stays like this, which I hope it will. England's being a better say. Second off, not as good. Would give Tunisia credit, it changed their system, but I've not been impressed by Tunisia at all. Not at all. In England far better in every department. So the story dramatically changes with that goal from Harry Kane. That makes it 15 goals in 25 England appearances for the captain, who's got a brilliant record with the arm band on. And he's challenged for the ball here. Harry Kane just flicking it on, just watching him. He was just holding his lower right leg. That is what England do not need. So give us a ring 08085 909693 for 606 tonight. And Torque Kelly-Cates and Terry Butcher who will be hosting the programme from Moscow, but will bring your reaction as well. From down below in the stadium, Gareth Southgate is lined up to Torque now he's alive, and we'll see who else we can bring on the programme. There's the final whistle in Volgograd. And England start this 2018 World Cup with a last-gasp win, courtesy of two goals from their captain Harry Kane. Well, I've got to say England first off, brilliant. What let them down? They didn't take the chances. Didn't put the ball in it. Second off, Tunisia changed the system. England folded hard. Delhi Ali Lingod came off the pace, but it's that man Harry Kane who saves the day. Corn have been down to some set pieces all night, flicked on by McGuire. Harry Kane there, we thought he'd get a chance. He got it, and England thoroughly deserved the score. Flat as Tunisia to one, it should have been a lot more. In the end, there are no flies on England. And I think the word that applies is few. England won, Tunisia won, England too.",
