  "transcript": " The ball is played straight to Alan Davis who touched it back to Duxbury and Duxbury plays it square to Gordon McQueen. In the middle of his own half McQueen the tall Scott chips it forward into the middle of the Brighton half. Scrunching puddles as Stapleton leaps and falls and the ball is played back to Graham Moseley and the first touch for the Brighton goalkeeper. The ball rolls it to his left back Graham Pierce must be very nervous for him like so many in the Brighton scene who have known nothing of this before. Only Jimmy Chase and Tony Greenish have played in this stadium before. Chase for Liverpool of course in his ninth appearance at Wembley. Tony Greenish for the Republic of Ireland and also incidentally as a Gaelic footballer. The ball is played from right to left by Graham Moseley dropping in the middle of the United half. Robinson has it through Robinson goes charging through and Bailey comes off to claim it off the centre forward so. Bailey asks him for the free kick because Robinson alleges whenever there's a studs showing the referee not interested. And so United after resumed by playing the ball short added a fence is now with Kevin Moran in the middle of his own half. Short ball forward to Ray Wilkins. Wilkins up to the edge of the centre circle has a little look. Chase checks and plays it wide to the right. The near side is Realees. Mike Duxbury on the ball now for United. Duxbury plays it through for Whiteside has come away from the middle but Gatting was infirmly. His challenge put the ball back up the right left wing and Robinson has it now but he tackles by Duxbury just inside the Manchester United half. And Brighton of a throw near side Manchester United right. Graham Pierce the former printer now the full-time throw with Brighton takes the throw to Gordon Smith. Gets it back to Pierce. Pierce has to scurry a bit loose ball from him. Then Wilkins plays it against the referee loses possession. Smith wins it for Brighton but his full forward went to Nohwell in particular. Moran collected played it back to Gary Bailey. Well just a matter of two minutes gone. Arnold Muren moving up the far side for Manchester United plays it to Albiston. Back in against Muren runs the challenge of Tony Greenish the elegant touch from the ball out to the right. Looking for Davis from how it looks in there with a header to play it wide. Davis tracks the throw and it falls out and Brighton has the throw. First off for Franklin Pitch. Well the pitch first of all George is doing quite well. There's a few heavy patches just to your right hand side here and obviously the first chances for him to bring come up to Flatheader from Upper Albiston. It will be very interesting to go into the area just before the second of it United with Gould and that's what I think. They can overcome the loss of Moses and Coppel which are two very important players for United and I think it could be a reasonably easy win if there is such a thing in the Coppinion because man for man they are a much stronger side than Brighton but of course they have the advantage of being underdogs and they can come here and make them relax and really enjoy the game. United down possession in the middle of a Brighton half. Stables and sweeps it to the near side to Davis. Davis faced by Howlett. Pucks it inside to Wilkins. Wilkins is really near and plays it for Robson. Robson firmly challenged by Jimmy Chase. That's a foul and a free kick. The first free kick of the match to Manchester United. Some 25 yards from the Brighton goal a little to the right as Manchester United looked. Chase fouling Robson making his presence felt. Ray Wilkins has placed the ball. Robson is there too. Brighton has four men across the face of the penalty area. The ball is in the back heel. Wilkins the chip. McQueen was there but Gatting headed it away. It goes to Duxbury middle of the Brighton half to all the set on the far side up the far touch line to Stableson. Robson is back to market. Stableson goes to the corner flag. Ryan Robson. Stableson dribbling into the penalty area. The chip across the header. Davis. Oh my word that could have been the first goal from the youngster. Stableson the mazy run up the left cutting back inside. It was deflected up in the air up a Brighton toe and there was Alan Davis on the six yard line heading just a wicker wide. I was a mavel strung out of the Clam Stableson. He went round to the friend defender as though he wasn't there and had a good cross but it was deflected up in the air right over the top two Alan Davis and it was a good header. It was only probably about three or four inches just past the fast post. Well that will give Alan Davis heart that's for sure. United in possession once the ball breaking towards Davis but firmly in. Graham Pearce the left back. Now it's Howlett for Brighton trying to pick out Neil Smiley on the far side. Stableson no intercept. Neuron has it all the way across the right side. He's in space on the right. Howlett comes back to cover. Gatting stands up. Played inside to Robson. Edge of the Brighton box. Now out to the wing again to Davis. Davis faced by Graham Pearce the left back. Six about running through. Tries to play it through the gap. It comes off. Howlett shins the cross eventually for Wilkins but Moseley collects it with ease and throws out to the far side to Neil Smiley. But the whistle had gone in any event. I imagine an offside. The free kick is to Brighton in their own penalty area. Graham Moseley told Dark Air figure Green sweater and blue shorts. Played the ball forward to Gary Stevens in the edge of the area. And he plays it square to Gary. Back to Stevens. And all the way across the fifth round to the right back. First touch for him. He's falling into the match that's United has. And it's accepted by Brian Robson. And Neuron now plays it forward for White side. Looking for Robson again but Ramsey is there. Ramsey fouled from behind. By Brian Robson who's been both receiving attention and fishing a bit out. And so Brighton with a free kick. Free kick then just outside their penalty area. Gary Stevens takes it for Greenish. Jimmy Cays in the middle of his own half. Stuck in the puddles there. That's going to be difficult. Right in the middle of the Brighton half. Manchester United because of that soggy pitch of one of the possession backs. And it's now at the Stuck Spree on the near side. Played inside to Wilkins. Wilkins for Robson in the puddles. Robson back to McQueen in the centre circle. McQueen the short ball to Wilkins and Manchester United weaved the pretty pattern. And find Albuson on the left. Chips it forward. Ramsey reads it well. Heads it out of play. United have a throw. Midway inside the Brighton half on the far side. United's left. Wilkins now. Neuron back to Albuson on the touch side. As a look. Curls it. Looking for a white side. He slipped. It comes to Highlet. Highlet passes back to the goalkeeper despite the presence of Norman White side. And the goalkeeper Mosey throws it out to Cays. Cays finds Pierce and Pierce back to Gathing. Gathing flips it forward. Jimmy Cays in the centre circle. Cays tries to pick out Smiley with an early ball to the right. Intercepted by Albuson. And McQueen's the United. And McQueen, Keon has Neuron. Neuron crosses halfway. Going up the United left. The far side. Hickside Stapleson. Stapleson has Stevens with him. Played back inside to Neuron. The Stapleson again but a good firm challenge by Stevens and the one through that was meant to be doesn't come off. In the seventh minute of the 1983 FA Cup final we await the first goal. Manchester United on the attack. Neuron has Stapleson tries to get something going there. But Stevens intercepts. Plays it to Ramsey on the far touch side. Ramsey's long ball forward. Too long for Robinson. More on Hazard. Plays it to Wilkins. Inside the Brighton half. On the left. Out to the far side. Stapleson again on the ball. Smiley with him this time. Stapleson out by the touch slide. Cech. Smiley tries to win it back. Challenges well and wins it. And plays it inside the Greenish. And Greenish rides the challenge from Ray Wilkins. By Steve Gathing. And Gathing helps it across the pier. Pierce plays it forward for Greenish. Back to Gathing. First time ball to Gordon Smith. And Greenish again. But Brighton tries to play football. Loose the ball. And now it's United with Neuron. Neuron just inside the Brighton half. Just outside the centre circle. Curls one out to Stapleson on the far side. Stapleson with Norgie-Lance. Lays it off to Albuson. Albuson to Wilkins. Wilkins forward for White side. Back to Wilkins again. Played forward but intercepted by Smiley. And now Greenish. And Greenish. Turning one way then the other. Plays it back to Ramsey the right back. Played concentrated largely in the Brighton half of the field. Long ball played forward by Ramsey. Goes off the head of Gordon McQueen. And out. And Brighton out of a throw. 15 yards inside the Manchester United half. Far side of the field of Brighton right. The ball thrown by Smiley. Smiley to Greenish. And back to Smiley. And now Greenish. Inside right position. Square ball to Jimmy Payne. Paced in the centre of the field. Midway inside the United half. Plays it back out to the right wing. He's Smiley. Gordon Smith over there to support him. Smiley cuts inside. Brighton first attack. Paced in the middle of the Manchester United half. Supported by Pierce behind him. That's the man he picks out. And the short ball played forward to Case once more. Davis with him. Case finds Pierce again. Pierce chips it forward. Was looking there for Gordon Smith. But Moore and got in with a header. Headed into Duxbury. Paced it forward to Ray Wilkins. Wilkins cuts the ball forward. What for white side to chase. But too long. All the way through to Graham Moseley. Quite a good start to the game. And I think Manchester United have just had the edge in the last few minutes there. Anil Muran when he has the ball in midfield. Pierce sometimes has been coming forward. And coming into the midfield position. Leaving a gap in behind him. And that's what Frank Stakelton is making most of his runs. And there's two forwards in Manchester United have already shown them mobility. It's been quite a good start to them. Brighton on the other hand have been knocking the ball about quite well. But lacking a little bit of penetration in this early part of the game. Gatting plays the ball forward for Brighton. It goes straight to Albuson. Albuson plays it inside to Wilkins. And Wilkins orchestrating from the centre of the field. Helps it on across to Mike Duxbury. Duxbury up the line. To Davis. Davis with two bright players and a sender's get the ball in the cross to Stapleton. Stapleton's backward header looking for Robson. But Greenish was there to intercept. Now Gordon Smith who lost his footing at the crucial side. Away goes Robson. Robson to Muren going up the inside left position. Muren back inside to Wilkins. Dead to the box. Back it goes to Muren. But a foul committed there by Jimmy Case. Andre Wilkins and United have a free kick just outside the Brighton penalty area. And that all began when Gordon Smith lost his footing in the muddy patch in the middle of the Brighton half. And now Manchester United have a free kick just outside the Brighton penalty area. And the referee picks up the ball. Tells Brighton to move further back. The kick will be taken about five yards outside the Brighton penalty area. And just in from the left angle of it as Manchester United look. Wilkins is there. Muren to and Robson. Muren curls it. Stapleton tries to get in with the header. Gatting clears it. Smiley helps it on. But once again everybody's in the Brighton half. Last man's back. Mike Duxbury. Duxbury on the ball. Just inside the United half. Forward it goes. And it works its way to McQueen. McQueen to Robson. Robson to Wilkins on the near side. Manchester United is playing the patient game. Working forward to Davis. Early cross. White side hitter. Just wide. I love the move there by Manchester United. And a lovely ball by Davis. A quick in-flinging cross there. And Norman White said he got a headshot. And again it just went past the post. But they're using the whole width of the park. Manchester United they're stretching this Brighton defence. And they've really settled down quite quickly in the first seven or eight minutes. Brighton as I said earlier, when they get the ball in their own defence, they're knocking it about quite constantly. But they don't see any confidence in actually going forward over the half-way line with it. They seem quite content just to pass it about amongst themselves. Goal kick taken. Ball again. Fines Davis. Davis have shown lots of self-confidence today already. In just the 11 minutes that we've been playing. Flies it back. And it works its way all the way through to Gary Bailey in the Manchester United goal. Latest news from the Scottish Cop Final at Hampton Park. It's as much as it is here. Rangers Nill, Aberdeen Nill. In the 12th minute. Brighton Nill, Manchester United Nill. A Jimmy Case on the ball for Brighton. Just inside the United half. Nearside of the field. Brighton left. Case plays the square ball to Greenish. Pacing Robson. Greenish looks to see who's available. Gordon Smith was. Plays it back to K. We're in the middle of the United half. Greenish now. Good ball forward to Robson. To Howlett. 25 yards to go. Howlett goes. Crouded out of it. Ball coming towards pace. Tangles with Wilkins. He caught Wilkins there. Brighton on the ball. United wanted a foul. Wilkins still on the ground. But Brighton comes forward with the ball. Wilkins down his feet again. Gordon Smith tries to hustle through. But United win the possession back. And Wilkins done the worst for that little incident on the ball. Plays it to the square. It's Duxbury. Duxbury can control it. Davis picks up the piece. Davis now. Just inside his own half. Chipped forward to Stapleton. Backward head of the right side. Stevens there though for Brighton to head it forward. Stapleton has it again. Running at the Brighton defense. Firmly challenged by Gatting. And it comes to Howlett. Howlett forwards for Robson. Little ball to Smith. Smith with Robson at his heels. Running diagonally. Plays it to Robson again. Smiley available on the right. Picked out there by Robson. Smiley right angle of the penalty area for Brighton. Running at Albuson. Smiley still going at his man. Gets across it off the Queen and behind it. Brighton in the corner. Good patient filled up by Brighton there. Smiley up the right forcing the corner. And that as I say is Brighton's first. The Jimmy Case has gone across to take it. 13 minutes of the match gone. Gordon Smith in the middle. Garny Howlett over with Jimmy Case. Alan Davis there to try and block it. Case strikes it firmly. Coming towards Gatting and Stevens. Ball breaks down. Stevens there. Smiley too. Gatting as well. The play behind Tony Greenish out on the left. But Greenish can still keep an eye on the attack going. Greenish. Jimmy's one way. Cuts in the other. Pays it square to Smiley. 30 yards of goal. On across to Howlett. Howlett looked up. Chips looking there for Smith. With heads of the net there. Gordon Smith just scored it. Garny Howlett made it. And Grayson are in front. Quite the marvellous move there from Brighton. And that beautiful chip ball by Logata Howlett there. Probably the youngest player in the park here. And it's a lovely ball. Just dribbled over the Manchester United defence there. And a lovely header by Gordon Smith. That is one type of goal that you wouldn't expect against the Manchester United back for. Because with Gordon McQueen being so tall in the air. You always felt a great move on his score. It wouldn't be from a sort of a crossing position. But that's a marvellous start to Brighton. Howlett said earlier that if Brighton had made it to Manchester United he could get the control of Missfield. And it could be an easy win for them. But this is certainly a tremendous setback for them. And it must have given Brighton marvellous confidence. So Gordon Smith the man who plays for Glasgow Rangers in the Scottish League Cup final this season. Stores for Brighton in the Football Association Cup final at Wembley. And that's his fourth goal in seven games. The man in four. The United strike right back at the heart of the Brighton defence. It's not more than on the ball. Place it forward as David. But Brighton break it down and away comes Howlett. Howlett has more than his heel. Two defenders together. Howlett checks. Comes back. Plays it to Gordon Smith. Smith infields a case. Case plays it back to Steve Gatting. And Gatting a good ball out to the right to Chris Ramsey. Good ball in the 10. But it takes the pressure off the heart of the Brighton defence. And Ramsey plays it forward now to Michael Robinson. Robinson runs away from Morris up to the edge of the penalty area. But he's driven very, very wide indeed. Howlett can get into the current challenge and Brighton have another corner. Well, Moran let Robinson come off on about ten yards there and then he managed to determine go pass them again. It's very unusual for Moran. He's usually a tight marker. But it's certainly got Brighton's heels up here. They've got the goal under the belt. And they've been given a corner kick. I thought he was going to give a free kick. There's a corner kick for Brighton as well. Brighton's corner there on the far side of the field. They're right. Jimmy Case will take it. Corner of an hour and a match gone. Brighton and Slump. Case firmly strikes it again. But this time he strikes it too firmly. It curls behind the goal. Curls out again. And United have free to an okay. I think that was a smashing header from Gordon Smith to put to Brighton one up. I feel as though Gary Bailey may be a little bit disappointed, George, because it wasn't a perucious header. And it skipped just before him. And probably the conditions may have something to do with it. Because from here anyway, it looked as though it was a possible save. Or it could have been a possible save. But anyway, he's still in the back of the net and Brighton are on the attack again. With Greenish. Greenish plays his square. Duxbury cuts it out. It goes to Brian Robson under pressure from Gordon Smith. He finds Arnold Heuron. Heuron plays it forward. A back ball from him. Case has it for Brighton. As to Robinson on the far side. Running up the Queen. Alderson in with a challenge. And the Queen helps the back pass. Back to Gary Bailey. Bailey rolls it out to Wilkins. We really have a stunning cup final on our hands. Manchester United starting firmly in control. Brighton then forced the first corner. And from that comes the first goal. And the other golfer in front. She goes her flying. Brian Robson plays it square to the left. Arthur Alderson just inside the Brighton half. Moving forward now. Gays the little ball inside the Robson. Robson ships it up to White Side. White Side can't lay it off to Alderson. Stevens selects. And suddenly Brighton are looking confident. Gary Stevens on the ball now for them. Stables and comes back to Harriam. Gays it up to Robinson. Robertson a little header forward. But there's no Brighton out in that space. And it goes instead to Arnold Heuron. Heuron on the left side of midfield plays it inside the Wilkins. And Wilkins helps it all the way across to Mike Duxbury. Duxbury up the line to Davis. Here sticking closely with him. Back to Duxbury it goes. Chipped forward. Into space is White Side. Edge of the area. Turns out Gary and Leeson. But can't turn around Stevens. And Gary Stevens is there to put it out of play for the corner. White Side for a moment looking lethal. Mike Duxbury is looking somewhat suspect. Easy to get the children confused because the other Gary might, the middle sex trigger is here watching Steve. Because middle sex is not playing today. Steve's got him certainly playing. Knowing he's in a match. United with a corner. Near side. There. Right. Muir on the cross. Untidy. White Side has it. Chipped it forward. Stevens there. Robinson two rubs and heads it across the Queen. Shot from the line there by Robinson. And an awful delay on the strike and goal line. And eventually it pushed away by Gordon Smith and Mike getting together. From the Queen's header. Cleared off the line by Michael Robinson. And United have a second corner. To be taken again by Muir and Leeson. Near side. Stuck firmly to the back post. Headed across into the area once more. With the flag up on the far side. The United's players coming in too firmly. The referee not interested. Declaring advantage anyway because Brighton cleared the ball. But United have it back once more. Wilkins plays it into the area. Gapping rises. Didn't head it quite correctly. Stableton has it. Comes to Morris. Morris falls over. But he was doing it another two firmly there. So Brighton have a free kick on the edge of that penalty area. Well that was a tremendous bit of pressure from Manchester United there. And the three stabs at that. The ball was knocked away. Headed back in again. But Brighton defended very well. And Manchester United now realize they've got to come back. But actually doing it. There's no good taking any of the ones from Manchester United. They're usually all doing the passing movement. And it would be nice to see. Actually you've probably seen the effect of Steve Coppel not playing. When he's got the ability to go up throwback. Go pass him. And get beyond him. And this is a finish. Manchester United do eventually fail here. I think he is one player it will be. Sadly missed today. Well there you are. Already contemplating the possibility of Manchester United failing with some of the bookies. We're concentrating 13th away at Omnipro. But we've only gone 20 minutes. So it's a long way to go yet. But Brighton driving forward once more. More and goes firmly in. Brighton run the possession back again with Kase. Lear side of the field. Sweeps out to the left. The course of Smith. Smith back inside the case. Wilkins comes on him. Kase plays the ball inside the Greenish. Greenish has a look to see what's on. Not much. So back it goes to Stephen. Picks out Greenish again. And Greenish all the way across to Smiley on the far wing. Smiley passes up to the Robertson. And with Robson. And Robson goes in like a tank and wins it back. And Smiley lies in the ground. United go away with the ball. Go in the queen. Moving up the far side. They're left. Played inside to Albiston. Albiston just inside the right and half. Far side of the field. United left. Robb by Greenish. He's everywhere. Greenish plays the ball. Square to Gathing. Gathing makes a little room for himself. And then chips it forward for Michael Robertson to chase. Robertson and Moren going together. Moren puts the arm into Robertson's chest and Brighton with a free kick. Well this is going to be one of the jewels of the afternoon. Republic of Ireland's team-mate Kevin Moren and the Manchester United centre half. And Michael Robertson to Brighton centre forward. Robertson has already shown a clean pair of heels to Moren. They went for that ball together. Moren's left elbow was somewhere in the region of Robertson's chest. Brighton has a free kick. 15 yards in from the near touch slide. Midway inside the United half. Here's the left back. Hanging ball but they were all out of sleep Brighton. Baney was able to come and clutch that ball with ease. And on his six yard line he pulls it across the face of his goal to Michael Duxbury. In the 22nd minute now one note to Brighton. Goal scored after 13 by Gordon Smith. Duxbury plays it up the near touch line. The United right. Gathing flips so to his right side. Back comes Pierce and it goes all the way back to Moren. And it's now Gary Stevens. The right centre half in place of Steve Foster. He chips it forward up to Gordon Smith. He's not in field. The case. Case more worried about the impending challenge and the pass put it out of play. United have it. Duxbury now. Just inside the his own half. Chips forward for white side to chase. But the flag on the far side raised. White side was offside. And Brighton have a free kick. And again Steve Gathing playing at the heart of the fence. So his favourite position is midfield. He takes it and feeds Gary Stevens. He is playing at his favourite position at the heart of the defense. And now Highlete. He's looked really composed so far. Plays it back to Pierce. Pierce is full not a good one. Staples and has it reunited. Just inside his own half. Square to David. David's down. Running at the fight to the fence. Running in the inside right position. Plays it out to Staples and on the wing. Back in field to Wilkins. Challenge firmly there by Case and Wilkins. They still die. The referee not interested. The ball was Staples in the hanging cross. Those who go down to collect on a six-star line. And Ray Wilkins is still down. Fred Egoes. And he was smiling for Brighton. The referee wasn't interested in that. Case and Wilkins have been hammering at each other. And Case and Robson too. But that time really case Court Ray Wilkins and has left the Manchester United player lying flat on his face in the Brighton half. Gathing at the ball. Ice is smiley on the far side. Referee Swistle goes. And for the first time the trainer comes on. Jimmy McGregor. The scoff who looked after the Manchester United players. Well, I'm going to get cornered to Manchester United. I can't think that any people outside Brighton would have believed that scoreboard away to our right on our left at 24 minutes past three. Right on the Hvaldian one. Manchester United built. But it's United who forced the corner then. Ray Wilkins back on his feet. But feeling that right shin rather gingerly I would think that Ashley grinds the substitute. There's a little bit of warming up below us. Another member of the almost dubbed in club here this afternoon. Muren with the corner. Down the left for United. Drops inside the area. The Queen goes up to challenge. Ball still in the area. Stapleson with the header and goes a couple of yards wide. So a sensational start certainly for the underdogs. The word that I'm sure we'll be using here this afternoon. Because United must come here as the hottest favourites in the earth. But the goal scored with the head of Gordon Smith after 13 minutes. And the Brighton supporters away to our left. Well, they're making it the south coast in Middlesex so far this afternoon. Brighton leading one goal to Nail Dreham. Moseley will take the goal kick away to our right. His kick just inside United half. McQueen and Robertson again together. Case bullets the ball forward. McQueen blots it out. Then Robson picks up the loose ball to United. Stapled him down the left far side. Just tells to hold it in. That red flag raised immediately. By Mr Downey from Hounslow. And it's a throw into Brighton. Which Chris Ramsey will take. Into Brighton at the free transfer from Bristol City. I thought he would have believed he was going to get wimpy this particular May afternoon. Finds Robinson with a throw. Not much space for Robinson. More than a couple of inches I would think from the far touch. And I mean he's battled. Has already won it. He gives it to Smiley on the halfway line. Smiley just smits the score of a good ball early to Robinson. Can he collect it? Yes he can. McQueen goes there though. And McQueen takes the ball away from Robertson. The two big man together. Two or four very good duels out there this afternoon. Halberston tries to go on a run. Leaves in the end. Stakelton just stamped the ball forward to Wembley. Now seems to be alright after that collusion with Gates. Sweeps it towards us. Picked up by Duxbury. Duxbury forward. Not quite rightly in the England squad. Played so well this season to United Duxbury. Finds Robinson. Ball runs away from him but he picks it up. Moves inside the centre circle. Already scarred with Mudd here at Wembley. Finds that man. Duxbury halfway inside the Brighton half. Forward. Wilkins back to Duxbury. The accuracy was missing though. Cut out by Pierce. Played forward once more to Grealish. Grealish the captain of Brighton. Deep fast to not play. He's sitting on the bench below us. Grealish and the ball played back once more to Pierce to fall back. And he got the pace. And he got the pace. He's got neither. He was pushing and shoving it in his face on Robertson. So it'll be a quick kick to Robertson. A little bit of altercation for a moment as he has Pierce on it to throw the ball away. He himself tried to get back. And Robertson now will take the free kick. Deep inside his own half. Short. Duxbury back to Robertson. And Robertson just slowing it down a little bit. Back to Warren. There's more stitches on a jumper this season. Warren for chest to Stapleton. 15 yards inside Brighton half. He's lost it really. Comes battling back. Just has a quick look. Keeps it cool. Plays it once more to Yatting. Yatting far side to Mosley. Mosley forward. Headed away though by McQueen. And Ramsey puts himself in trouble. And Stapleton rams it again. It's Stapleton with the ball. A yard in from the far touch line. Comes away from Ramsey looking for the cross. That is fun. Wilkins has got to be the problem for Brighton but how it's carried out. But it still goes back to Wilkins. Wilkins forward. Stapleton's back. The header. Mosley saves. Fletting strikes for a new defender. Stapleton's dark head coming in at the far post. Down with header. Mosley there. Turns it aside for a corner. I was a really good chance there for Manchester United. And as you said there are Frank Staple don't come in. You always fancy them. But it was a good save by Mosley. And that was the only time that Frank Staple can have good pass. The brain defence. He caught 20 gruelish ball watching there. And Frank Staple can come in on his blindside. A corner then to Manchester United. And Alan Davis will take it down there left. Here it comes. With his right foot almost on the centre spot. Headed away though firmly by Stevens. Drops a little nearer and though. Back out to Davis in the outside left position. Davis. Cross comes in. Looks to Stapleton. And quick thinking by Yatting. Clays the ball. And it's another corner. And David Staple just stays on the ground for a moment. So Alan Davis. The young Rosman. Really knew yesterday that he was playing in this cup final. He's spot the ball up again. Got another muddy section of the green turf here. Linesman says it's not right. Now he's spotted up in the corner quadrant. And Davis will come up once more. Again the corner with his right foot. Ball headed straight up in the air once more by Yatting. Drops though. Right side. Edge of the Brighton penalty area. Back to Davis. Gets away from one defender. Murend. Cross from Murend. Headed away once more. And the referee says that's right. Stevens is being fouled. It's a free kick to Brighton who lead by one goal to deal. Right in defense. They're coping very well with the crosses that's coming in. We're all talking about the first to have been out. And they'll be sadly missed. But until now Yatting and Stevens have done remarkably well in the defense. And the goalkeeper looks nice and sound too. And that's said goalkeeper has just taken a short back pass. Graham Mosley rolls the ball out. To Steve Yatting. And the Brighton. Or went down to Brighton from Arsenal. Steve Yatting. A particularly light flank as a central defender. But right where he's playing so far. Lays the ball forward. Cut out there by Morden. Just inside the Brighton half. A back heel from Wilkins. Finds Davis. Just below us in the Manchester United right flank. Lays it forward. White side. Falls down. As much as the surface. Davis though has broken up the little Brighton defensive action. Davis can he get one to defender. He has. Lays the ball across. Mosley drops on it. As Robson was scoring in. I think another occasion Davis did well. I think that made the loss his putting a little bit. Meant to scab it into the path of Robson which had surely to be a goal. And couldn't really have the strength in the end to find Robson. So Brighton will breathe again. Again they'll calm it down and the ball bowed out once more. Far side to Chris Ramsey. This is the last two games for suspension. Playing today in the big one. Long ball played forward this time by Stevens. And again asking Robinson to do some chasing. But Bailey comes off his line. And it's notable that although Brighton lead by one girl to nail. I doubt that Bailey has touched the ball more than three or four times so far this afternoon. And one of those occasions was to pick the ball out of the back of his net. After Gordon Smith that's headed Brighton into the lead. It's United in possession. Still inside their own half. Ball played back to Moren. Starts to move forward. Still inside his own half though. Then finds Robson his captain. Robson on the white line of the halfway line. And plays it forward with his left foot. Some 20 yards to Muran. Lovely left foot of Muran. Far side though. And it's Albuston for United. Forward. White side. Shields the ball away from Ramsey. Still holds it. Tight to the far touch line. Cross comes in deflected though by Ramsey. It'll be yet another corner. So Manchester United. And that was something like 30 or 40. Cameronman and photographers behind that goal guarded so far successfully by Graham Mosley. And again it'll be a corner though this time Muran. Mistaking instead of Davis. Two, three, four, five hits it with his left foot. It drops. Mosley is there. Mosley is lost. His footing where he says that's perfectly fair charge. Working for the cross coming in. Mosley's there between and he's headed off the line by Ramsey. Still inside though the penalty. Robson with a shot. Great save by Mosley. High drama here. Ball headed off the line by fullback Chris Ramsey. Robson with a shot. Mosley scored which couldn't have been easy because there must have been four or five players between Robson himself. I was saying the ball to get started. Mosley's a goalkeeper for the bigger game. He was a goalkeeper there Frank. Certainly was. That was a marvelous save there. And I think when Ramsey headed that would fall off the line. It was just a reaction knock away because it almost hit him and it was very unlawful for Manchester United's point of view. The only thing I can say wrong about it is usually the two players who are getting into the white positions are front stapled in the normal white side. So the strength has been taken away from the middle as well when their ball eventually does come in there. And this would be the advantage of Steve Cropel with Flynn. He would go there getting the ball in. Two stapled in white side. 32 minutes gone then and Brighton lead here in the FA Cup final by one girl to zero. But it's United in possession still inside their own half with Moran. Moran long ball forward edge of the Brighton area headed away there once more by Stephens. Finds case. Case deep inside his own half. Long ball forward one by Smiley. Smiley going down the left near side to us for Brighton. Smiley still having the ball he's gone inside the area. The cross comes in just over the bar. Lovely running by Smiley. Robinson taking like a cat. Out of the boots and that might well have eluded Gary Bailey yet again. This time swears over the crossbar. Beautiful cross by Smiley. Did everything right and Robinson almost made it two. Yes they haven't attacked a great deal Brighton but when they have done they've looked very dangerous. Smiley's a very quick boy. He was the guy who took over from none on the right side. Now he's come over to take Moran on that time and he's certainly has definitely pitted for the mind-sustaining back four. Well Smiley the young man who wears contact lenses until they call him Stetny done at Brighton he didn't need contact lenses then. That was a perfect cross to Robinson. United won down but fighting. They have possession. A long ball from Albiston played down the left. Ball runs away though from Manchester United and Pierce. Good skills being shown by the left back. Moved across there. Finds that man. Smiley now trying his luck on the right and again showing good skill. And that was a strong positive, firm tackle from Robinson. He meant to get the ball and he got it and Ramsey takes the throw for Brighton. Finds Greenish. Greenish to K's. Early ball played forward. Smith filled it too far for the Edenfall. Michael Robinson. The man who may remember that Mark Amalson reckoned to be the best number nine that Ingrid had ever seen. Didn't quite come up to those expectations but he still scored some spectacular goals Michael Robinson. But it's Smith who's done the damage so far here for Brighton but it's United going forward and well I think White's had to have done more with that. Another man of course who's had a remarkable 12 months. Youngest player ever to play in the World Cup finals for Northern Ireland. Again scored some beautiful goals for United. Just lost himself there a little bit. More might have been on there for United. 34 minutes gone here at Wembley. Brighton won Manchester United 0. Ramsey the right back for Brighton in possession. Long ball for again looking for Robinson. There are two red shirted Manchester United players though. Ball is cleared and United take up possession. Wilkins along raking ball from Wilkins far side the left from Muren. Muren tries to find Stapleton. Ramsey goes into challenge. Slides the ball into touch. Muren will take it. 20 yards inside the Brighton half. Leaves it in back in the end. The throw comes in to Muren. Runs away from it for a moment then gets it back. It's a chip ball too. Picked up by Albuson looking for Stapleton ball. Booted straight into touch. It will be again after Albuson who comes forward. Takes the throw. Stapleton back to Albuson to Muren. Muren with his left foot crosses it high inside the area. Davis comes in for the challenge. Cleared by Pierce. Robson forward. Headed away there once more by Gapping. And the blue jersey is a Brighton. Pick it up once more. Deep inside their own half. Howlitz. Good ball to Greenish. Greenish good ball to Kase. In the end the green reddit either better. Gets it away from Kase. Rebound. Pines rocks in half. Inside the Brighton half. Switches it out towards us. I thought it was in touch. Linesman says no. Davis goes after the Brighton defenders. Lovely skills here by Davis. Pines right side. Shot comes in. Deflected off Kase. Moseley's there. And Brighton live again. He's certainly done well. The young guy. He's only coming today. He's only at four games Alan Davis. But he showed some nice touches. I was just in the air live when Frank Steeble can go to the white side. This is for the Manchester United midfield. Must be making runs forward. And up until now it's only been their captain Brian Robson who's been doing that. The other players Muren and Smiley are usually staying back in plain balls. It's not really their style. But that's what they must be looking for. Because they have got a little bit of lack of penetration when one of the centre forwards goes to the right position. Nine minutes to half time. United one down. But going forward again. Steeble can. White side that you've run on today. Chips the ball back to Wilkins. Halfway inside the Brighton half. Wilkins out towards us. That's the United right. Dutch free. Back to Wilkins. Wilkins has a look. And then a long ball that's to go to the long to Moseley. Well it dropped it in fact but he was quite safe because he made sure that Steeble was around the other side. Brighton in possession. Halfway inside their own half with Grealish. Certainly most of the play in that Brighton half. The half to our left still looks perfectly green. The half to our right which is the Brighton half. Looks very muddy indeed. Davis for United. Starts to move forward. He's now halfway inside the Brighton half. Going down the United right. Just Chips I think ran away. They bounced off his heel in the end. And it was fairly easy for Gatting to turn it back to Pierce who clears firmly with his left foot. High and long. Looking for Smith. Loose ball picked up by Gris. Watson's left first. Finds White side. White side shoots. Moseley ponded away. And certainly I've seen White side score from those angles before. I get the feeling that White's a little tentative when he gets the ball. Indeed the referee's learned for an offside decision. But there are three or four occasions there where I've seen White side score immaculately this season. Looks a little tentative. Perhaps he's the pitch. It looks a little bit sluggish actually which he sometimes does because he's not the quitter the flair feeder. But he's a very strong boy and the pitch is heavy as well. He's probably enhanced that a little bit more. But that was a good shot with his right foot as well. I know he can score with his right two but he's left with his favourite. But that was in a cute angle. And I think if Moseley had made a good save there that was going to be in the park corner. But Brenton and Roli hanging on a little bit here. Manchester needed a turning on the pressure. And they haven't to reduced a great amount of attacks. But when they have got forward they've looked quite dangerous. They have possession then. Manchester United once more with Moran. Still a long way inside his own half. Not a good ball from Hitton though cut by Howlett. Case back to Howlett. Gets around the referee. Inside the centre circle. Stabbed it to his right. Pull back Chris Ramsey comes forward. Moves inside United half. Played a lovely ball. Robinson offside. Yellow flag went up straight away. No nonsense at all from Mr. Potter. From Kidderman's staff. It was offside. Robinson went forward. Probably not heard the whistle. He didn't hear how. He would have been absolutely certain. He wasn't. He didn't go into the back of the net. He wouldn't have made no difference either. And United take the free kick. He's got seven minutes to half time here. The ball is laid forward and white side going for it. There was no time for Mosley to come off his line. He was protected in any case by Steve Gapping. Again just calming things down. Bounces the ball once twice. And then comes out to the edge of that 18-yard area with his right foot high to the sky. Almost halfway inside United half. Albusdon heads the ball back again but it's picked up once more by Grealish. And a chant of seagulls, seagulls over Wembley from the Brighton crowd away to our left. Brighton leading by one girl to middle. Howlett in possession. Lays it back. Stevens. Again nice calm football at the moment by Brighton. They've taken a fair old hammering so far. Howlett stabs the ball to his left. Red easily though by Duxbury just calmly hooking the ball back to Bailey. Bailey's back to the players to move forward as he rolls it back out to that same man Mike Duxbury. Finds Wilkins. Wilkins starting to move forward. He's inside the centre circle. Lays it forward to Stapleton. Stapleton lets it run. And he was looking really for Albuson to come through but it was a little bit too heavy to pass and the ball rolls into touch. And Brighton no particular hurry to take the throw. As I say they have taken a fair old beating. Got a ball headed off the line by Ramsey. We've had two splendid saves by Mosley. And the latest score in the Scottish Cup final is that there's no score. Six minutes to go in the first half there up at Hampton Park. And Aberdeen the holders know. Ranges Nill. Aberdeen of course who we saw in Gothenburg last week will that win that thrilling European Cup with his cup tie against Real Madrid. Rangers Nill, Aberdeen Nill, Geert Wembley. It's Brighton one. Manchester United Nill. Reelish for Brighton. Finds Smiley. Starts to move in the field. They've tucked the ball back to Stephens. This time a long ball from Stephens. Looking for Gordon Smith to do some running but Albuson is there. Takes no chances. Lays it straight into touch. Throwing it back. Like Norbert's parallel with the Manchester United 18 yard area. Smith himself will take it. Goods Ray too finds Smiley on mark. Smiley squared the Jimmy K. Jimmy K's playing wide at the Howlett. Howlett backs the Jimmy K's. Too far out for one of these torpedo shots possibly it is. Lays it wide to Smiley. Edges of the Manchester United penalty area. Smiley's back to the truss. Robinson with a header. Oh what a save by Bailey. Again a beautifully accurate truss. Robinson Gray goes in. Heather there. And this time it was Danny Bailey who's earned his money. Now that was a good save by Guy DeBilly and a terrific guy with a header from Mike Robinson. I've seen him four times this season and he's been quiet almost every game and people are saying what a good player he is. Nothing from now I haven't really seen it. But today he certainly is looking at threatening this cousin. Marana McQueen when he does get an opportunity. He's causing lots of problems for them in there. Well he's a tough performer but it's Michael Robinson. They formed quite a spearhead for the Republic of Ireland. If you're going to imagine Michael Robinson, Frank Statham, they're not a bad player to be playing for the Republic of Ireland. I think his head looked like he was a tremendous crack of heads. He's going to be all right though. He likes to be called Michael incidentally rather than Mike. He tells me. There comes the corner. Ball headed down and Statham is back to defend and the ball spins away from his boot. It's another quarter to Brighton. We've got here now four minutes to go to half time. And Jimmy Case spots across one spot. So used over the years to see Jimmy Case in red jersey and red shorts for Liverpool. Sixteen medals he won for that great club. Now in blue. Very much a Brighton man. And beaten here by Manchester United. You may remember him as 77 final but he did score on that occasion. Now playing for Brighton. His side lead in the dying minute to the first half by one goal. He'll pace through the corner. Drops onto the penalty spot. Headed straight up in the air. He's still inside the area. Finally cleared by Muren. Only goes as far as Pierce though. Ball played wide to Jimmy Case. Case has to turn the ball back to Greenish. Greenish holds and the cross from him heads to the United penalty area. And McQueen's left net. All the ball just wide. Terrible mistake by Gordon McQueen. He was almost too casual. And that really could have been number two because Gapping was up there when it mattered from the cross. And Gapping could so easily put up and strike at United net. And he certainly could have the Manchester United defence but absolutely sleeping there. And Vichy Wilkins is going back and giving him a real shellacking. But for all same before the game that Manchester United would probably very very dangerous in dead ball situations. With all the calm men. But in this game especially when it's been corner kicked in dead ball situations. Brighton has been the team that's been looking the most dangerous. Good after though. Still going forward. Stable on taxi to Muren. Ball played wide. Alderson's holding it. The cross comes in. It's defected off Ramsey and Mursi. Mursi has dropped it. And it's in. Is it hurt not to the referee? Mursi dropped it. Wilkins was there. The ball rolled over the white line. We could see it clearly from here. But again the referee has been around some time. And he said there was an infringement by Wilkins on Mursi. No goal. Three kick to Brighton. I don't think I was the goaler told me that I think he obviously dropped the ball. But I think it was a few inches this side of the line. I don't think British Wilkins actually fouled him either. So this is one of the situations I get a little bit annoyed about. If any time a goalkeeper makes a mistake. Normally the referee blows three kicks against the guy who's coming in. But in that case I don't see Wilkins making any foul. The ball is halfway inside the Brighton half. Headed away once. Four by Steedon. He's been a matkill it so far. Steedon this afternoon. But the ball's still gone to Robson. Robson plays it forward to White Side. Good catch comes in on White Side. Wilkins comes back. It's a tremendous battle here at Wembley. And Brighton leading by one goal to Niel. And again Jimmy Case coming in strong. Down goes Alan Davis. Booze from the United supporters. Great competitor though Jimmy Case. Three kick says the referee. Halfway inside the Brighton half. And we're now in the last minute of this first half here at Wembley. Wilkins will take the free kick. Plays it forward. Mursi comes in. But Mursi was surely fouled by Robson. referee says yeah. Robson going in strong. Probably with his elbow as well. Hitting the ball with his elbow. And Mursi being comforted by his defenders. Referee immediately blow the whistle. No complaints from the Manchester United players I may say. So another free kick to Brighton. And again Mursi taking several times. Drops the ball up very very carefully indeed. Born in Manchester game Mursi. Used to watch the Reds at the Stretford M. Here he is now guarding his goal against those same Red Devils from Manchester. That's the foul this time by Gordon Smith on McQueen. So it'll be a free kick. The two stocks move together. McQueen gets the advantage. More than once to take the free kick. We've now actually moved into injury time here. There have been two or three stoppages. Sure I'll say we'll have a little time on. White side coming for the ball. He's lost it though. Stapleton comes through and wins it. Then he's lost it. And the ball finally runs loose. White side comes into battle for it. Still halfway inside the Brighton half. Robson. Long ball forward from Robson. Oh dear. No real accuracy there. Robson knew it. Look annoyed with himself. And tastes quite correctly and sensibly left the ball run over the line. A good psychological moment of course if Brighton could go in one-nil up. No question about that. Because all the nerves tend to jangle in the first half. And they've done so well at Brighton. They take a tremendous shellacking from the Manchester United. But they've got the goal. And this is certainly in the first 45 minutes. It's going to be one of the biggest upsets of all time in the FA Cup. In this the 102nd FA Cup final. Long kick from Mersley. Headed straight back again though. Ball inside the Brighton half. A far long right side this time. Steve Gatting the offender. Another free kick from Manchester United. Must now only be seconds to go. Again it'll be Wilkins to take it. Deep inside the Brighton half. The free kick from Wilkins. Far side looking to stay with him. Chest it down. Moseley's there though. Protected once more by Gatting. Brighton really now needs to keep possession of what must be the dying seconds. Gordon Smith score of the goal is in the outside right position. Far side. Fine smiley. And that's the whistle blown for half time. So really we've had a tremendous upset here in the first 45 minutes. The Virgin Amelia's trotts away. I don't think you can believe it. One actor will have lots and lots of things to say to his team you can be sure. Because so far we've got the biggest upset I think possibly of all time after 45 minutes. Because the score line away to my left says quite clearly. Right on her valbian one. Manchester United nil. And Brighton now return to that dressing room occupied by Sunderland in 1973. Occupied by Southampton as well in 1976. They both pulled off shot one nil victory. I wonder if we're heading for another one here again this afternoon. Some quick comments. Then we'll have time to sit back and look back over that first half with Paddy Crane and Sammy Nils. Somebody I have to come to you first. The Brighton man. You forecast one nil but you said it would be a late penalty. But even so I saw you rise out of your seats when Gordon Smith put that goal away. Yeah I'm absolutely delighted. Especially with Gordon scoring because he's such a talented player. And he doesn't use all that skill he has. It's amazing. I'm just delighted for him. A great performance by the fellas. The other moment where you also leapt out of the seat was when Graham Moseley at the end of the first half dropped the ball. It looked like Shades of 58 when Harry Gregg dropped the ball and that lost us 40 minutes. That's right but I think Ray Wilkins actually pushed Graham in the back so we were lucky to get away with that anyway. Are they exceeding your expectations so far Brighton? Well I said one nil victory. Off we go. The ball is back with Steve Gatting and he plays it with his unfavorite right foot out to the right side. Albuson rises. Heads it in to touch and we've a throw in on the near side of the field which is the Brighton right in the second half. And Chris Ramsey who lives near the Arsenal football ground in London and plays for Brighton takes it, throws it up the line to Robinson. And Brighton mounts the first attack of the half. Off Albuson it goes out again and they've thrown out Brighton six yards from the Manchester United goal line. Curly headed, Nils Smiley takes it. Little blonde figure back to Chris Ramsey. His cross looking for Smith but more on when this one comes to Greenish. Greenish heads towards Howlett. Howlett heads it back. Case lobs it forward. It goes out of play and behind for a goal kick to Manchester United. Gary Bailey throws the fetching and carrying and takes it quickly. It's a mooran on the edge of the penalty area. A mooran who pobled out of the Moscow final here against Liverpool and what was really part of Manchester United's undoing was they lost their services in that match. There's a long clearance from Bailey up to Whiteside. Whiteside to Mooran inside left position. Curls towards the box headed away by Gatting back to Mooran. Now Robson Whiteside in there. Handle the ball. He shoots it there but it won't turn because the referee saw that he had handled the ball. It was a one-offal moment the referee hadn't spotted it but it was a blatant hand ball. Whiteside finished it off, put it in the net to get the perfection that happened ahead for the referee for his feints. It was a little over-exuberant from that occasion pumping the ball with his hands before making contact with his foot. Brighton in the free kick. Mosley takes it. Mosley has it back. Brighton move up field on the goalkeeper who used to be a Manchester United fan. As the youth clears his lines, McQueen heads it forward to Whiteside. Whiteside to Mooran. Mooran out to Albuson on the near side. Albuson now on a run up to the Manchester United left. Whiteside goes on the overlap. Nobody marking him here. It's time to measure the cross which he does. Mosley comes out and crushing the ball firmly to his chest on a stick-shard line. Now Whiteson till the Brighton defense moves away. Here's Kane for the short pass but Mosley decided against it. He now rolls it instead to Gatting. Gatting on the edge of the penalty area back to Mosley. Sablevin was too close for comfort and Mosley can now clear his line once more with the long right foot in the feet. Gatting in the middle of the Manchester United half of the southern area. McQueen beats Robinson. Greenish comes to win it back. Ramsey there too. Between them they find Smiley. Little former Crystal Palace winger running it on of Mooran. Running inside Mooran. Still going. Find Smith returns for Smiley. Smiley falls over. McQueen comes away with the ball and Wilkins in trouble too on the pitch and Caste does well to almost get it back for Brighton. Eventually it's Alan Davis who pops up in the mud to square away with the ball. McQueen helps it on to Mooran. Long ball for Staples of the Chase. Stevens is aware of the danger. Stevens across the cover steps over the ball. Two is a light. The ball is out of play and that's a goal kick to Brighton. Stevens put under a bit of pressure there by that long ball forward but always the confidence. England's 121 defender. Very very composed foot forward. Young man for Risfitch. Playing in the colours of his hometown from very much a Brighton player these days as Mosley takes the goal kick. The ball is out of play and the Manchester United half. Greenish wins it to Smiley. Back to Greenish. Greenish chips forward for Robinson. Heads it down for Smiley once more. And now Smith. The Smith has overrun that one. I think yes. Out of play it goes and it's a throw to Manchester United on the near side. Oh we've gone three minutes into the second half. Right? It's nice to see Smiley coming back into the game. He's got such pace but the previous games I've watched him and he only comes in in little flashes. But he certainly has got the ability to go past the Manchester United defense and it would be nice to see him get a lot more supply of the ball. The ball with Gary Bailey now from Manchester United. He tears it deep into the Brighton half. Gattings wins it. Goes to Ducksbury. Far side of the field. United right. Just inside the Brighton half. Plays it inside. Angle ball to Robson. He plays it all the way out to Davis on the far side. His pass forward and intercepted by Pierce. Then goes Robson thundering into the challenge of Kase. The ball is won by United but Moran who played it forward finds only Greenish. United have it back though. Ducksbury inside to McQueen. It'll stab forward for Wilkins on the centre spot. Lips his feet high as he runs clear of the modern and tucks it back to McQueen. Stepping inside the Brighton half now. Gordon McQueen. Chips it forward for White Side at the edge of the penalty area. Now Wilkins. Wilkins tries to feed Stapleton. Ramsey gets in firmly. Ball comes back out to McQueen on the edge of the centre circle. Angle run away from the centre circle. McQueen eventually has to play it back to Moran. Moran now. Right half position. Deep ball into the area. Headed away by Stevens. Comes to Smith. Smith's agree issues everywhere. And an intelligent first time ball to Smiley. Smiley and McQueen tangling up the right. McQueen firmly in the challenge. The ball just got long enough to give Smiley the chance to leave McQueen standing. The tall Scottish defender. The Scottish defender firmly in on the little man and Brighton with a throw. Ramsey to Greenwich back to Ramsey. Ramsey feeds Smith. Chests it down. Plays it into the middle of the United half. Howlips goes countering after it but Ducksbury is there first. Up to White Side on half way. And back to Mike Ducksbury. Ducksbury ducks inside his own half. Plays it inside to Ray Wilkins. And Wilkins sweeps it out towards the left where Ramsey. Seath is going to feed Moran. Moran rather. So let's feed him too. And run out of play. And Brighton never throw once more. Midway inside their own half. Near side there. Right into Greenwich. Back to Ramsey. Ramsey sees Stevens free. Stevens plays it forward from the edge of his penalty area. Up to Robinson. Headed down. Albuson for United now though. And now Moran. Now he waves some Dutch magic. Arnold Buren moving into the middle of the Brighton half. Deep angle ball to the far side looking for Alan Davis. Pierce read it well. And lets it run out of play. And that's a goal kicked in quite. And really Brighton looking very composed for put on the pressure in the early stages of the second half. Yeah well the game started very well for Brighton really because it was quite even at the moment and we were expecting an onslaught from Manchester United. But Albuson had a chance to go forward there and it turned back and knocked it into his back forward when you put the team advantage of getting into the attack and getting into the Brighton penalty area as quickly as possible. Brighton's goal kick headed on by Alan up to Robinson. Firmly challenged by Moran and United have the ball. Mike Duxbury now. Chipped up to wide sides. Challenged in the back by Stevens. And that's the free kick to Manchester United. 15 yards inside the Brighton half. 15 in from the far touchdown which is United's right. Ray Wilkins is there ready to take it. United get bent up to the edge of the Brighton penalty area. Wilkins now with the free kick. Chipped to the far post. Up goes McQueen but he's underneath that and over the bar it goes. Roofing high off his head. Behind Brighton yet again have a goal kick. Graham Bosley will prepare to take it. And some other teams seems to have gone out of the match. The first seven minutes of the second half. It's not half as friendly because it was towards the end of the first. There's a long access has been telling us man to cool down. They don't have to win it in the first minute of the second half. They've got the hole in the second half to come back at Brighton. But it's Brighton in the driving seat. One nail up the goal scored after 13 minutes by Gordon Smith. Macross by Gary Howlett. And that's what divides the teams at the moment. United though in possession. Brian Robs just inside his own half to the left to the near side to Alberson. Up to such night of white side. Good control on his chest. But Ramsey alive to the danger goes thundering in. Interesting that Ramsey fouled white side and white side seems to exact a little of his own repribution because Ramsey is on the ground and injured. And Gary Stevens telling Norman White side in no uncertain terms what he thought of the challenge. United have the free kick but Norman White side is having the lecture from the referee and Chris Ramsey the right back is on the ground. White side are very dually. The field is Ramsey is on his feet again. United have a throw in fact. It wasn't a free kick. And the ball taken towards Alberson who gets the cross in. Skids away from everybody. Ramsey is down on the ground again. He's obviously feeling the effect of that knock. And the ball is played back to Graham Mosley. And he's hoping rather badly Chris Ramsey now. This doesn't look at all good for Brighton. George Aiken the assistant manager is telling Jerry Ryan to take off the heavy anorak and the track suit and get ready for the action because Ramsey looks in considerable distress. And United are now trying to mount an attack up Chris Ramsey's wing. Ball played in though to Wilkins now. They switched the point of it. Looking forward Ducks bring the far side. How it resisted the stage to go charging in. But Pierce didn't and Ducks did away in a run up the United right. White side there. Diving head across the face. White Stapleton makes it 1-1 with 9 minutes of the second half gone. And Ron Atkinson can scare the conceded delight. It was played up the line by Ducks. To Davis. Pierce committed himself totally. Stuckfully went storming up at the second chance to get the cross in. When it came it was very close to the Brighton goal. Mosley missed it on the near post and Stapleton for two yards. Ducks it home. That's exactly what Manchester United were looking for there because again it was a little bit of a stalemate and we were wondering if they were ever going to come back again. And the first all started with Wilkins cross goal pass. We looked a little bit dodgy actually. Looked as though it was going to be intercepted by one of the Brighton midfield players. But it reached them. He's done right back Ducks but he went in a good run. And he was lucky enough to get the rebound there and they got a chance to get the second opportunity to get his cross. And he did so and it was clicked on and Frank Stapleton really couldn't miss it because it was only about a foot from the goal line. But this should make the match even more interesting. It was quite a good first half and then it started off a little bit quiet. But now it's really all up near now. And it looks as though Ramsey's certainly been taken off. He's looking behind the goal just now and it looks as though Jerry Ryan is coming on for Brighton's substitute. Chris Ramsey then put out of action and Jerry Ryan goes on. Ryan who's something of a super stuff for Brighton now. He's lost his regular place to Gary Harlett because he was out of injury. But he's back in the game now and he scored a few vital goals for Brighton in his time. Jerry Ryan. Not the least of them the goal at Liverpool that helped knock Liverpool out of this year's FA Cup. Brighton now back where they started. The score 1-1 Stapleton with the equaliser and Greenish was thundering into a challenge on the far side to win the ball back for Brighton. Now have they got the character of the resources to come back to Brighton or are we now about to see Manchester United the third best team in England come and claim the FA Cup. Muren on the ball for United just inside his own half near side of the field at the United left. On it goes to Albuson. Albuson back to Muren. Muren chips it forward. Steve has though controlled it and dances away from the challenge because there was a foul committed there by Arthur Albuson so Brighton of a free kick. And it seems to be a great swap Frank. Jerry Ryan and right back for Chris Ramsey. I was going to say that George I would imagine rather than upsetting all the team plans because the great defence are back forward with playing to purple especially the two centre half have been absolutely outstanding and rather than dragging him all round the place you've got to just put in a man for man. Well Brighton on the attack once more. Smiley the long free kick from Stevens. Tangling there with Albuson. Smiley's gone down hurt and United come away with the ball and suddenly a little bit of niggle into this game. All started with that challenge by Norman Whiteside and Chris Ramsey which is put Ramsey out of the game and now Smiley is helping and United go off in the attack. Stapleson going up the left. Ryan with him. Stapleson hard by the touch line. He knocks it back to Muren. Muren looks up to measure the cross. Deep one Whiteside there. Two tol for him. A weight of the far side and Howlett watches it. He keeps it in play and plays it forward now to Pierce. He plays it back to Howlett and Howlett moving up the left hand touch line for Brighton. Howlett played inside to Jimmy K. K's now middle of his own hand. Back out to Pierce the left back. Pierce back inside again to Gatting and Brighton just doing their best to keep their heads at this most testing of times for them. Ryan on the ball now. Chips it forward to Smith inside the United half. He plays it back towards Greenish and Gatting. Gatting has it. Greenish is there with him. Gatting plays it all the way out to Pierce. Howlett back inside to Greenish. Greenish now just inside his own half. Forward to Smith. Loose one from him. How to play it goes. United have the throw. Just inside their own half. George Aiken the Brighton assistant manager is shouting instructions onto the pitch which I think is a lovely spot he will take exception to. United on the ball now. Wilkins all the way across to Arthur Alberson played inside for Muren. Muren a little ball forward for Stapleton. Angle of the six shot after Alberson. Right for a shot it ended up across and Howlett has gone chasing after it but the Whiteside gone anyway. A foul there in the box and Brighton had the free kick. Still no score by the way. The Rangers 0, Aberdeen 0 and the Scottish cup final. The tragedy of smiling is down as well because he certainly is limping and has been going on now for a couple of minutes and they can't afford that. They've done well keeping the game as it is. United try to put an attack together. Whiteside unable to beat. Stevens Moseley as the ball. Jerry Ryan should have a little bit of an experience there. He was pulled right into the centre half position and Arthur Alberson came down the left side here and got on the blind side of him. So I just hope that he starts picking up that position and sends very quickly. Quarter of an hour almost of the second half gone. Brighton 1, Manchester United 1. Ryan goes forward with the ball. Up to Gordon Smith. Played back to Ryan. Ryan now. Deep inside the Manchester United half. Square ball to Kate. Kate chips it forward looking for Robertson. Robertson though offside. United have a free kick. This really is an interesting time. United as expected coming back at Brighton. For Brighton to show just what they're made of. One-one the score. Gordon Smith for Brighton after 13 minutes. Frank Stapleton for Manchester United after 54. Brighton in possession just inside their own half. Kate forward there for Howlett as well to get away from the challenge. Howlett running up more and wrong footed him. Tries to find a gap to go through. Good dribble this play. Howlett by Gary Howlett and sweeps the ball out to the right to Gordon Smith. Smith now. Right angle of the penalty area faced by Alberston. Tries to make the angle for the shot. Tries to force it through. It comes out instead to Greenish and Greenish helps it out to the right. The near side to Ryan. Now Jerry Ryan. Time to measure the cross. Looking for smiley. Heading on there. Falls down for Robertson. He can't control it. It goes over to Duxbury and away to United. Duxbury inside to Davis. Too much in the second half. Davis forward for Robson. Back to Davis again. Davis chips it off the line for Whiteside. Whiteside controls it with his left foot. Plays it to Robson just inside the Brighton half. Square ball to Muren. Muren forced by smiley to back pedal a bit. He's now 12 yards inside his own half. Then he plays it to Wilkins. He's in some space over on the right. The far side. Wilkins now. Moving forward for Manchester United. 15 yards inside the Brighton half. Up to Stapleton. Lay it off the Whiteside. Tries to get the 1-2 going. Jerry Ryan. Alive for the danger. Shefferdon stapled it all the way. He's got the toe in to help it back to Graham Mosley. Now it's Gary Stevens for Brighton. Stevens to Smith. Gordon Smith. Fall inside the case. 10 yards inside his own half. He loses out. Wild challenge by Arthur Law. The second gift to ball to Gary. Howlett. Howlett plays it to the far side for Duxbury and Percept. And he plays it back to Gary Bailey. Bailey pulls it out to Arnold Muren. Muren moves it to the left half position. Moves forward. Smiley comes across the cover. Muren chips it up the line to Stapleton. The Whistle has gone there. Offside against either Stapleton or Whiteside. Signals by the 9s on the far side. And so Brighton has another free kick. And now keeping that through. Admirabee Brighton for a team that must really be feeling the pressure at this point. Seagulls. Seagulls goes the chance from a way to the left of us. The tunnel of sea of blue and white. As Gary Stevens takes the free kick. Muren heads it out. Heads it to Muren. Muren 10 yards inside his own half. Thinks about the long ball forward. Runs then 10 yards further. Then chips it for Whiteside. But Stevens read it so well. And now Ryan on the ball played inside to Stevens. And Brighton really are composed of the back. And Stevens doing it again. Just shimmying away from Brian Robson. And moving forward elegantly. Up to the center circle. Forward night of Jimmy K. The ball goes to the left of the ball. The ball goes in the middle. Stevens continues to run to the edge of the box. 25 yards and goal. Shoot. But straight at Gary Bailey. First Brighton shot of the second half. But coming at the end of the best Brighton move. The first half is a lovely move. All started by Stevens. He's a smashing game all the way through. And it makes a difference if one of your double center halves does make the break into midfield and create the extra man. And Young Smile has finished up there with a shot from probably 22-23 yards. But they're certainly looking nice and composed. The pressure has been on them because United get the goal back. But they haven't really been dominating them since then. Brighton are still looking nice and composed and confident. And it's still a nice even game. United now moving forward. Stables in on the end of the neurons pass. But chip over the defense too long for Robson. Mostly saves it. It's now a smiley. Smiley fouled by Mike Duxbury who's headed into the back. Duxbury not a dirty player by any means. A little over exuberant there. And smiley is not the words for the experience. So it's a pre-kick to Brighton. Getting fake. The far side of the field is now with Kase. Kase on the ball. Just inside his own half. Then into the United half. Changed his direction forward for Highlet. He wasn't expecting that. So United win it back. Robson to Muren. Five yards inside his own half. The left hand push line two for Norman White side. Was Ryan Beatson. But now is Albiston. Tries to beat Ryan again. But Jerry Ryan equal to that. Heading it out of play. And then showing admirable coolness. Now the longest serving Brighton player. He's been working since October 1978. Getting his reward today. United though moving forward once more. But again Gary Stevens there to break that. But a little bit of stopping it on the edge of the Brighton box gave Ray Wilkins a chance for a shot. But again that man Stevens into it. The ball is out of play on the far side to the throw to United. Duxbury will take it. Twenty five yards to go. Far side. The United right to Wilkins. Back to Duxbury. And forward it goes for Norman White side. But just a little too long. He had to stretch a bit. Play it back. He did well to get it back to David. Wilkins with a cross table. But a overhead and over bar and over everything he throws. And behind them is the goal kick to Brighton. And Graham Mosley will spot it up. And in no particular hurry to get on with things. One won the score. We're in the 20th minute of the match. The second half that is. Sixty five minutes gone. Brighton won. Manchester United won. Mosley's goal kick. Not great length on it. McQueen comes up with a firm header. Straight to the other number five. That's Gary Stevens. Stevens stomps it up the far side of the touch line. But far side of the touch line being the operative form of expression. Because out of today it is the United of the throw. Taking quickly Wilkins on the edge of his box. Righted back to Moran. Moran chips it forward. Pierce reads that well. Heads it down for Howlett. Howlett now. Good ball out to the right. Gordon Smith is there. Jerry Ryan too. Smith thought Ryan was going on the overlap but he didn't come so he's forced to play it inside the gating. Gating in the center circle. Thinks about using Stevens and then chimmy's the other way. And then uses either Pierce or Case. Case it was played rather firmly between them but Case allied to that. Chips it forward now. Not particularly good one. Wilkins heads it forward for United. And now Stapleson running at Brighton. Stapleson to the right side. Right side back to Wilkins. And then Stuckings around his ankle. Wilkins square balls to Albiston. On out to Muran. Near side of the field which is the United left. And midway between Halfway line and goal. Muran now. Good ball inside to Albiston. They're on the edge of the penalty area now. But Howlett falls over as he came away with the ball. Soon he pushed to me but they're definitely happy enough for the challenge. But it matters not because Ryan is there to do the tidying up. And play it back to Graham Mosley. And Mosley bowls it under arm back to Ryan. Large number 12 in his back. Ryan inside to Gary Stevens. And Stevens moves towards the Halfway line. They're coming more adventurous in the second half. Gary Stevens. Little ball in there to Greenish. Greenish trying to go around Wilkins. Wilkins pushes him aside. And then Stuckings' shoulders and asked the referee what it was all about. But I think it was quite obvious what it was all about. Greenish took a tumble. And Brighton get a free kick. Just inside the Brighton half. Or is it just inside the United half? That's where Gary Stevens takes the free kick forward to Greenish. Back to Stevens. Up it goes to Smith. Smith, middle of the United half. Back to Greenish in the mud. Now forward for Stevens once more. Stevens tries to shot. And Bailey has to look sharp to get down to save that one. Always behind it but it was dipping rather viciously. So two shots recently from Smiley and then Stevens. And Bailey on his knees saved it. And the ball is now with Kevin Moran. Moran, middle of his own half moving forward. Slowly but surely. Now up to Halfway. Now Chips is looking for White Side. White Side Ryan gathers. Howlett infirmly. And Howlett comes away with the ball. And White Side is penalized. And I think Jimmy Case is in there rather firmly too. But the free kick has been given to Brighton. Gatting takes it. Sweeps it to the near side. Jerry Ryan. Ryan that. To Smiley on Halfway. Near side of the field. Smiley inside to Tony Greenish. And Greenish back to Gary Stevens. Just inside his own half. Made it forward. Michael Robertson. Tangling with McQueen. But McQueen comes away with the ball. McQueen now running into the center circle. Forward for Stapleton. Inside the Brighton half. Stapleton running at that Brighton defense. To White Side. But Pierce robs him. And Pierce now moves forward for Brighton. Sloppy pass from him. Muren intercepts. And Muren just inside the Manchester United half. Forward it goes for Robson. Robson in the inside left position. Running up the Brighton defense. But the ball eventually works its way through to Graham Mosley. And he'll wait and take his time and then roll it through Steve Janet. So we're into the final quarter. Brighton one. Manchester United one. Here's Peter Jones. The ball with Brighton then. Just inside the Manchester United half with Robinson. He's Tangling with Moran. They're getting in the quick each other up and throw each other through the air. Three kicked United Wilkins. Stockings on his ankle. Takes it with him. Finds Robson. Robson to Muren. Still inside his own half. Pleased towards us. United left. White Side waiting for it. Touches it back to Arthur Albertson. Albertson finds Muren. Half wins at the Brighton half. Two Wilkins. Wilkins battling for it well. Accuracy was missing there with the final pass. Ryan lets it run on the smiley. Get the return ball from Smiley. Smith inaccurate into the part of Muren. Muren finds the Welshman Davis. Davis ten yards inside the Brighton half. Keeps it running out to the right. Duxbury far sides United. Stapleton in the outside right position. Jersey has always outside those white shorts. Back to Duxbury. Duxbury holds it. Then tucks it back to Wilkins. Possession stuck here by Manchester United. Halfway through the second half. One-one in this final. The Queen forward. Stapleton. Chests the ball down. Tries to find Robson. Tarns. Good tackling by Gatting. Ball finally cleared on the halfway line. United though still in possession. Albertson back to Moran. Moran ten yards forward. Finds Muren. See a lot more of Muren in this second half. Hows the ball. Put him to the left foot of his. Sweeps the ball out to the right. Headed away though this time by Pierce. Wings. Chase. All his experience now required for Brighton. The Brighton given the ball away on the edge of the area. Davis is there. Service to White Side. White Side shoots. High and wide. Deflected. Corner says the referee. Dangerous moment for Brighton though. Nice build up. Davis in the action. On to White Side. Ball wide. Corner to Manchester United. Good chance there for Manchester United. That was a bad mistake there by Pierce which gave way to the chance. But he was leaning back on it all the time and you can tell it was going to go over the bar. But I've been a little bit disappointed with Manchester United this last 10 or 15 minutes. They certainly have lacked penetration. Peter and Wren have been looking very comfortable. Davis for the corner then for Manchester United. Back header by McQueen. A header comes in just wide. Some of the United players training possibly a handball there. Robson went in strong and so did Moran. Ball goes wide. Goal kick to Brighton and up at Hampton Park. Still no score there. Rangers and Aberdeen. The Scottish Cup final of course. Rangers Nill and Aberdeen the Holders Nill. Here at Wembley. Brighton won. Manchester United won. And Frank Stableton who played in three successive Cup Finals here with Arsenal. In the middle one of them. That's the 1979 final. Scored for Arsenal against Manchester United. And it's his goal for United. That's brought them level here. Nine minutes into the second half. It's a throw in to Brighton. Almost on the halfway line. Jerry Ryan who came on for the injured Chris Ramsey. In fact the referee says that'll be a free kick to Brighton. And it's about 10 yards or so inside United half. Just to the right of Brighton. Look at it. And it's a good one for the day. Tony Grealish will take that free kick inside the air. And McQueen hooks the ball away. Finally cleared by Alberson. High into the early on to Ryan. Though it's still inside United half. White side comes back to challenge Ryan. And Ryan's challenged by Miran. And Ryan goes down and Miran's got the ball. Miran on the half run. And streets are lovely. And Ryan Wilkins going down the right here for Manchester United. Wilkins still holding the ball. The cross comes in. All what they've got. This is the goal by Ray Wilkins. Ray Wilkins once again. Now very much of Manchester United. A man who's missed so much of this season with that cheap injury. Is now doing a Mancunian Fandango. Away down the left. Ron Atkinson is leaping in the air. He can't believe it. And the left side of the ground says it's true. Because Ray Wilkins with the most magnificent shot. High over Graham Moseley. It's soared into the corner of the net. That's a goal worth winning any match. It's certainly a goal worth winning a cup final. Now Brighton have got to show their qualities. Because Ray Wilkins has put United into the lead. It's Brighton one. Manchester United two. And the man is Ray Wilkins. And now a marvellous goal by Ray Wilkins. There's a lovely through ball from Arnold Miran. And Wilkins cut inside his goal back. And I was just actually wondering what he was going to do. Because he didn't have much support from any other Manchester United forward. He just cut inside him and hit a lovely swim and left foot shot. It curled all the way past Moseley. And it was an absolutely super goal. And Arnold Miran actually in the last 10 minutes has really come into the game. And it makes such a difference when he's on the ball and spraying the passes about. Because too often this season in the Manchester United team he's been really on the missing list. But in the last 10 minutes or so he certainly has sprayed the ball about well. And he's looking much better. And it's certainly helped Manchester United. But the goal came at just the right time there for Manchester United. Because they weren't shown any penetration prior to that. And the game is going along quite nicely as far as Brighton is concerned. But now it will even make it a bet again. Because Brighton will really have to come out and try and get the equaliser. 17 minutes to go here then. And Brighton who's been very brave and played some good football too. Now need to be very brave indeed. United take the lead for the first time here at Wembley in the 83 cup final. With an absolutely smashing goal from Ray Wilkins. Only a second goal incidentally of the season. What a time to score your second goal. I see Mick Brown, the assistant manager of United coming out onto that sand track below us and flapping his hand. Also I see Ashley Grimes doing a bit of limbering up. I wonder whether he'll be thrown in for the last quarter of an hour. Manchester United 2 right and 1. And it's now all red and white here at the moment. But if Brighton continue the way they've done they'll battle right to the last gasp here. They've really done the, I was just about to say the first division. They've done the second division crowd right here this afternoon. Religated of course. And here they are at Wembley but they're now 2-1 down and they've also lost Chris Ramsey their full back and they've given them all away to Stapleton. Stapleton finds White Side. White Side tackled and brought down by Stevens. Referee says that'll be a free kick. White Side wants to take it quickly. Watson says no. Let's just calm it down. It's about halfway inside the Brighton half. To me as if Tony Grealish wasn't very happy with that decision. Having a few words with Althgrey. The referee wouldn't be wise to do that. Althgrey in his last match. Flows the whistle. Robson goes up as if he's going to take it. He then does. Lays it to Wilkins. Wilkins put it onto his left foot. Little chip ball. And mostly this time being very careful. Just watched it drop over the top of his trough. And Wilkins, those stockings around his ankles. Really has not seen such delight in a player for a long time. He absolutely left in there and ran all of 50 yards behind that goal and jumped over a line of photographers. Just to signal his jubilation. He now claps his hands for the players around him. Captain of Chelsea at 17. Ray Wilkins. They know what leadership is all about. Right in one. Manchester United two. We've got 15 minutes to go. And an absorbing cup final. Mirren for United. Fine Stapleson. Good running though again by Gary Steedens. One of the men of the match here. Steedens. And he plays the ball off Stapleson to win the throw for Brighton. Almost on the corner flag. And while certainly United may have come here as the hottest favorites for years. Brighton certainly made a match of this one. And they're not out of it yet but they're two-one down. And this could well be their crisis period. They've run the ball into touch this time though with Jerry Ryan. Who's playing it right back in place of Chris Ramsey. Alderson with the throw. Fines Mirren back to Alderson again back to Mirren. Halfway inside the Brighton half. That trusty left foot of his to the far side. Gone beyond Alan Davis though. Davis will scuttle after that one. And the ball rose into touch. It'll be a throw into Brighton. Well they're going to win the cup. Shot Manchester United away to our right. Still some chance of seagulls to our left. To the photographer. He's done something wrong. He's just being led out of the steering. But pity he's going to miss a smashing last 13 minutes I would think here. Great atmosphere. And United leading by two goals to one. An in possession inside their own half. Gordon McQueen. A long ball. All of 20 yards or so back to Gary Bailey who holds the ball carefully. Sun is far the Roy of course. Distinguished girl people that it switched to very long ago. As they take the kick over the top of wide side. Drops for a moment of gattain. Can't quite control it. But tears clears for Brighton. That's become storming into it just inside the Brighton half. Far side from us down the United right. All they did in Wilkins is there. Wilkins brought down. And that will be a free kick to Manchester United and Jimmy Case. And that's a mergers and accent. We'll say that was an accident. Great competitor though Jimmy Case. And it'll be a free kick to Manchester United. Right. Smile from Sammy Nelson. I said that. United leading two one. We'll have a free kick Kevin Moren just taking a great deal of time and care. One of seven Republic of Ireland players among the 24 this afternoon. Stake them with a header. Robson tries to go in ball cleared though. Not very far. Wilkins halfway inside the Brighton half. Plays it towards us. Alveston will go there. He gets there first. He's recovered now from that knock he took on his leg. The seconds now took away. 13 minutes by our watch here. Manchester United two. Brighton one. Alveston with the throw down the United left. Plays it back to McQueen. McQueen just slowing it down. Just pops forward. Then starts to move in field. Plays it to Robson. Robson shielding the ball. Turns away from us. Starts to go towards the center of the field. Finds Moren. They're getting the position to take the ball from Moren. Sweeps a good ball out far side to Davis. In field to Robson once more. Robson inside the center circle. Plays it to White side. Runs across White side. They can't control it. Smiley sensibly does the simple thing. Plays it back to Moseley. The long long kick from the Brighton goalkeeper. Halfway inside United half. Blonde hair of McQueen headed away. Finds Robson. Stapleton back to Moren. Possession stuffed by United. Halfway inside their own half. Ball swept out to Duxbury. Duxbury holds it. Then a 20 yard ball from him looking for White side. But they've lost it and Brighton take possession. Halfway inside their own half with Harlots. Another Tammden Park. Still no score. The Scottish Cup final between Rangers and Aberdeen. Still Rangers nil. Aberdeen nil. You had it Wembley. Manchester United two. Brighton one. But Brighton possession with Kase. We're going to have one of these sensational shots from Kase. Well, wouldn't be any good because there are about 10 Manchesterity players between him and Gary Bailey. Well, nine to the exact. His White side almost in the center circle. Kase forward. It just flick on. Ooh, it almost got through there from Smith to Robinson. The doors closed shut. Well, it's shut tight once more. White side. White side. White side. White side together. And again, Stevens doing a little bit of fouling. Gary Stevens on Norman White side. The man from Shanty Road in Belfast who's had a remarkable 12 months. Picked himself up. And it'll be a free kick to Manchester United. And this time it's United in no particular hurry to take the free kick. You see again, Nick Brown, the lurcher that clenched fist in the air. One Atkinson looking cool. I doubt that he is. Free kick to Mürim. Mürim down the line to Stapleton. And Ryan taking no chances. Played it out of, picked it out of play. And Stapleton picks himself up. And chance of 2-1 away to our right now from the United fans. Mürim drops across. Man who won the UEFA Cup with Ipswich. He's never won here, Arnold Mürim. He even lost playing for Holland against England. And inside lead at the moment. 10 minutes to go. Mürim with the throw. Stapleton runs it back to Robson. Back to Mürim. Tight to the near touch line. The left. A back heel from Mürim finds once more Robson. Robson's back coming to somebody to move towards him. Can't so flick it back to Mürim. The cross is done from Mürim. Ball headed away. Only as far as Wilkins does score of that sensational second goal. Robson back to Mürim. That's 5 passes that strung together now United. Robson. Oh and a bad one from Robson. Case challenges white side. Ball breaks to Robson. Hits the side netting. Case on white side. Clashed on the edge of the area. Case has come off second best this time. Hilling his left knee. Referee goes over. Just have a look at it. Case down. And we wait for Graeme Moseley to take the girl kick. But there's so much a testing time for Brighton. Taking the lead. Going in there one and a half time. Losing Ramsey. Then the equaliser. Then two on down to a girl that would knock the stuffing out of those teams. They've been very well really on the whole of the match. I think they've looked very composed and they've certainly played a little bit better than what I expected before the game. But nevertheless there's only roughly 10 minutes left and I wouldn't be surprised if Timmie Mille just gambles a little bit. It's worthwhile taking the chance and possibly putting Gerry Ryan up front. Giving a little bit more firing power because you're as well going to beat 3-1 as 2-1 because you're still going to get beaten at the end. But they're still sitting back at the moment and I'm a little bit surprised that George Akinard, Timmie Mille, hasn't issued some instructions because they have four players at the back against Norman White side and Frank Stableton. And I think you can at least afford to release if he's actually needed. But it would be probably bad tactics when you have two-one up to actually change your system around. I think they'll just remain the same way as they are. Well, Jim DeCase back at his feet again. The goalkeeper's been taken and the ball is on the halfway line. And it's good skills by Gordon Smith as Scotsman. They're even better skills and strength by Robson the Englishman. Robson. Wilkins. Again good possession stuff here by Manchester United. They're still deep inside their own half with Davis. Davis just turns away from a half-hearted challenge by Smith and sensibly just plays it back calmly to his right back duck screw and turns, plays it back to Gary Bailey. I think Alan Davis, generally speaking, has had a good game. He's been nice and neat in his control and he's been involved in two or three dangerous situations. But nevertheless, I think the style of Stevie Coppels' play, who's got the pace and the power to get past the back, has certainly been missed. And I think that's probably one of the reasons why Norman White side and Frank Stableton are reasonably quiet games. Well, the ball is played back by the United defenders to their goalkeeper Gary Bailey. A little head-on by Stableton, but again, Stevens there. He really has been absolutely immaculate for my money this afternoon. Gary Stevens at the heart of the Brighton defense. All late forward by Ryan. Still header again by Robson looking for smiley, but there's plenty of time for Arthur Alberson to come in and turn it back to Bailey. Certainly, if Alan Davis needs any model support in playing his first cup tie here at Wembley in a final, he needs to only look at the man standing about 25 yards behind him because Arthur Alberson is exactly the same. In the 1977 final here against Liverpool, Davis has come out of it very well so far. Whistle goes, three-kick to Manchester United, halfway inside the Brighton half. We've got seven minutes by our watch. Maybe a little time at it on. We've had two fairly lengthy stoppages for injuries. Wilkins takes the three-kick Stableton back. White side almost getting onto that back view from Robson. Well spotted by Brighton. Ball headed away, but at the moment, Robinson who's fought so hard looks rather a lone figure. If the minutes stick away, of course, we begin to have to see some of the real qualities of Manchester United. They keep possession and again they turn it back. Would you believe almost got splashes of sunshine here at Wembley as the ball is back with Bailey? Manchester United have done a good play. They've pushed Alan Davis up front. I don't know if he's been told to do that. They've just done it naturally, but it's made now Manchester United have been three-forward. So it's sort of a keeping the back four of Brighton all well occupied, but I still think it's worthwhile, even playing man for man and releasing when your players either to go into midfield or up front. As Ryan plays the ball just below us, down to Brighton, right. Smiley, ball's been in touch before Smiley can control it though. Referee says that's a throw in to Manchester United. The Jalberston will take a rather lone blue balloon, floats away to our right. Could it be the end of Brighton's strokes? Well, there's still five minutes to go. It's their captain for the day, Greenish laying it forward. Smith and Robinson together. Smith sweeps the ball out left. It's picked up by the full back rim. Piers forward. Smith inside the Manchester United penalty area. Left for Brighton. Smith trying to get in there, can't get in there. Broke down there by Mike Duxbury. Referee right on the spot. Gordon Smith heals himself off the turf. Now then, the free kick is not more than a yard outside the Manchester United penalty area. Down the Brighton left. Referee will make sure that the two United players, Davison Mirren of the 10 yards away, still not happy. So it's now a packed Manchester United penalty area away to our right. United lead by two girls to one. Case with the free kick. Oh, headed away by Stapleton who's defending before Ryan to get on the end of that one. Throw in to Brighton. Piers will take it. Down the Brighton left. Four minutes to go here. Manchester United two. Brighton one. Brighton they're going forward. There's nothing else they can do now. The cross coming in far side. It'll be too far though, I think. Gatting will run up for it. Gatting takes the corner flag in his hand with his momentum. He couldn't stop the ball going over the line though. It's a throw in to Manchester United which Albuson will take. Hose the ball above his head. Then takes the throw down the line below us. Stapleton can't get hold of it though. Smiley. Smiley's lost it. And then gets the ball back with a rebound. It goes to Smith. The Queen heads the ball away. Corner to Brighton. Quick and sharp. And scorer of Brighton's goal after 13 minutes. Junior case, the old warrior. Comes prodding across towards us to take the corner for Brighton. Spotted up in the quadrant. You can see what he's going to do with it. He's got Harlett if he wants to play it short. He doesn't. In fact, it's low. Greelish edge of the area. Greelish inside the area. Shot comes in. Brighton will score. And it's Gary Stevens I think who's got it. What a final we've got here. And Gary Stevens, the man I was saying a moment ago, who's had an immaculate game for Brighton. He was there for that corner. Chased with the corner. Greelish spotted him. He went in where it hurts. And by going in where it hurts, he tracked it home past Bailey. We've got three minutes to go. The Seagulls have come back here. It's Brighton to Manchester United to Gary Stevens. Oh, that's a body close to Manchester United. The great news for Brighton fans. Stevens done terrific there. But the Manchester United defend seems to take about three or four seconds before they even started to close them down. You could see the danger from up here. And maybe it was a little bit heavy legs there or something. But no one really went to him. Any opportunities to look up. Pick his spot and blast it past Gary Bailey. If someone in the Manchester United defend should have closed them down there and made it much more difficult for them. But the great news for Brighton and the which is going to make you turn this. We've got three minutes to go. Three minutes to go. Brighton to Manchester United to. And then the third ever goal. But Stevens are scored for Brighton. And up at Hamden Park. Well, they're not getting goals up there. Despite the sunshine I'm told. Still Rangers Nail. Aberdeen Nail. But we've got an absolute humdinger here. Brighton to Manchester United to. Fork played for Woodmore and got hold of that one just before Robinson. Robinson had his head down there like a. Really going to go hell then for goal. The ball is almost on the halfway line. Far side Wilkins. Wilkins chips the ball forward Stapleton. Again United in possession. White side White side got run the defender. White side inside the area. And White side was doing a bit of shoving and pushing. White side went down inside the area. But it's a free kick to Brighton. I think White side knew that too. We've got two minutes now by our watch. Maybe a little time at it on. More and more then looks like extra time. I think we were saying this morning that the pitch is so heavy that the players would know they've been playing for 90 minutes. They will be. It's going to be another 30 minutes now. But it's Miran. In field finds Albuson. Albuson to White side. White side out to Miran. Miran's got a free run down the left for United. Miran going down to the byline. The cross comes in from Miran. And Stevens is there to clear it for a corner. Corner to United. With now a minute to go on our watch. Brighton to Manchester United to Brighton going in at half time with a 1-0 lead. Then 1-1, then 2-1, and then 2-2. Corner then to Manchester United. Alan Davis first cup tie. It's the Wembley cup tie for him. Takes it with his right foot. Arc's inside the area. McQueen with a header. Wide. He has controlled it. Robson with the back overhead kick. But Moesley was there. Moesley did well to get to that one. Overhead kick though for Robson and Moesley there. Now 30 seconds from the 90 minutes by our watch here. Brighton to Manchester United to. And this I think will be a memorable final for so many reasons. Not least to them Brighton's fighting qualities. Smith tries to get hold of it. Dutchby gets there first. Still right in possession. No deep inside their own half. Gatting has a long look. No mistakes now from either side. In the down seconds of the 90 minutes in this 1983 cup final. Long ball forward. Robinson runs that high knee action of his but he was never ever going to get that one. It's fielded by a couple of photographers. Bailey runs across to take the field kick. Ports it up. Takes it. Wilkins in the mud in half way inside that United half. It's turned up I may say when it was the Brighton half in the first half. Wilkins. White side. Finds Alveston close to the near touch line. Wilkins forward. Stapleton edge of the Brighton penalty area. He's hemmed in by Blue Jersey. Still finds a bit across from Miran. A little flick ball off. And that's it. She's wide. And Alan Davis could have made history there. He's good at it with his right foot. And White's. Was that a White side or Davis? I think it was Davis Frank was it? Yes it was Davis. He nearly scored in the first half and they almost scored there. He just got too into that. He came across here there. He was just standing watching the ball and he came in the blank side of him. Got in front of him and that was nearly the winner of just the last few seconds. Well what a day. That would have been for Alan Davis. And up at Hampton Park it's still 0-0. It's the full time whistleblower up there. So they've gone into extra time at Hampton Park. Aberdeen of course the holders against Rangers. Well it looks like extra time here but that could well have been the winner. That could have been back to the old Arsenal Manchester United finally. You may remember when Arsenal 2-0 up then 2-2 to United and then Arsenal's winner. I remember I described it that day as I just didn't believe it. I don't think I'd have believed that if Davis had scored but United would have believed it. We're now in injury time here. Brighton 2, Manchester United 2 all played wide by Howlitz. But before Smiley could get there plenty of time and we really are bathed in sunshine here. The rain's gone for the moments. Miren Robson runs over the ball then plays it back nice and calmly to McQueen who stands on the ball for a moment. He's got plenty of time and space. Miren playing it down the near touch run United left. And the run clatters into Stapleton, picks himself up. Free kick to Manchester United. Miren takes it with his left foot down the left touch line. As White Side got the leg, he hasn't got the leg. Runs over the line and that's the whistle blown by Howlitz Gray and it's 2-2 and it's extra time. And now it's got a little bit of magic. Miren Robson moving into the Brighton half. Then he checks and plays it back to Ray Wilkins. And the sun beaming down now on Wembley Stadium. The pitch showing what's gone wrong with the weather here in London over the past week because it's showing the signs of wear. But the sun now out to make it a real FA Cup final occasion. And Kate sweeps them all to the far side to Jerry Ryan and Ryan slowly moves up to the Brighton right to Smith. Smith tries to find Greenish but the pass is short and Robson goes herring up off the far touch line. United's left but Greenish is firmly in to feed him. And put the ball out of play and Manchester United have a throw. Robson takes it, throws it to where he thought Arthur Albiston might go but Arthur didn't go. So he really did and back it goes now to Graham Mosley. Mosley throws it under arms to Jerry Ryan who's still maintaining that right back position that he's occupied with Chris Ramsey's departure. Long ball looking for Robinson. It goes instead to Morn and the Queen in between them they get it back to Gary Bailey. Bailey now pulling it out to Mike Dufferey on the near side, the United right. And Dufferey's son in his face chips the ball forward for White Side. It comes off the shoulder of Gary Stevens. It comes to Alan Davis. Davis facing Pierce to Brighton left back. Davis running it here. Pierce stands off, tries to make the angle impossible. He succeeds. It's played back to Wilkins. Wilkins a hanging cross. And it goes all the way over the Brighton and United's flares and outs the far side to Arnold Viren who's now got Jerry Ryan in close attendance and shadow over there. Viren succeeds in forcing the corner. The first corner of extra time with one and a half minutes of extra time played and the corner is to Manchester United. On the far side of the field, United's left. And Alan Davis in only his fourth full appearance from Manchester United. He played three and a half games with him before he's now playing a game and a half. And he's gone all the way over there to take that corner on the far side United's left. David curls it to the near post. Case heads it away. It comes to Muren. Muren helps it out to Davis on the far wing once more. Davis curls in the cross this time. Mostly comes. And again he loses it but Brian Roepsen was filing him to Brighton out of the free kick. And it's taken quickly to Pierce. See that back. Pierce stands on it. Mostly thinks about asking for it back and then suggests that play it off the substance and indeed he does receive it back. And throws it straight back to Grand Pierce. Gatting is inside. That's where Pierce looks for support. Gatting on the ball now. Substance. Let's put it forward up to Howlett. Howlett stockings around the angles. Runs away from Wilkins. Leaves it for Gordon Smith. Smith plays the short-folded case. But on the near side the Brighton left and inside the United half. To Pierce now. Pierce forward for Smith. United reluctant to commit themselves to the tackle in this area. Pierce slips on the ground. Falls over. Picks himself up. Receives the pass. Plays it back to Case. And Pierce is challenged and filed by Mike Duffere. And now Duffere is on the ground holding his back. Referee comes across. I think they have a word. Two words with him. One to ask is the all right. And the second to tell him he went in rather too firmly. Duffere is all right. Flights you away from the scene of the crime. And Jimmy Case prepares to take the free kick. A yard in from the near cut line. United's right. Grand Pierce there. Jimmy Case too. Decided between them what they'll do. Pierce plays the short-folded case. Case has made an angle for a deep drop. He sends it over. Looking for Gatting. It's headed away by Stapleton. Goes to the far side. It's out of play. And Brighton never throws. And Neil Shreily, that muffle blonde hair bouncing behind him as he chases over there. Takes the throw. Back to Ryan. Inside to Greenish. They've had to move backwards. Brighton. But now it's with Howlett. And now Pierce. They're going to try and work the left side once more. The near side. Here. Slow motion stuff. Up the line to Robinson. Robinson who's showing the effects of the stress on the strain. Puts pressure on more on the ball. Almost done. It is out. But Case barely did succeed in keeping it in. And so once again Michael Robinson. Offward angular and looking very, very tired. Succeeds in straining Kevin Moren beyond the point of endurance. And out goes the ball for a corner to Brighton. Now a corner produced the first goal for Brighton. A corner produced the second. Is there something on here for them? Gary Howlett on the near side. The Brighton left. Sun shining from a clear sky as Howlett strikes it. Robinson the backward header. Stevens up there. Down for Smith. But the whistle is gone. Stevens was filing. And Manchester United breathe again. Well Brighton are really matching Manchester United in every department here. They're looking nice and strong. And especially the midfielders looking very employed. Jimmy Case should always experience today. Made a lot of good tackles and been involved in a few nasty ones as well. They generally looked after themselves very well. And both Ian Greeler should have been real stars in the midfield for Brighton. Norman White side falling far off the referee again. They say they're very physical flair. Certainly he went in rather too physically on grand fierce. Giving away a free kick. 15 yards inside the Brighton half. Near side of the field. Brighton left. Mike has Steve Gatting. Ways it forward. Ship forward. Looking for Robinson. Moren heads it away. Goes to Green. Chanel Howlett. Howlett shimmies one way. Leaves Robson standing. Howlett still running. Robson back on him. No foul. Robson and Howlett go crashing to the ground. Robson loses his right boot. The ball goes to Muren who sends it up to right side. White side trying to get Staples and going. Stevens intercepts Brighton and possession once more. Howlett to Gordon Smith. Smith in the inside left position. Looking for obstruction after a Wilkins. But a negative two-tive man crashing there. And the ball is now with Arnold Muren. Robson still adjusting his footwear as Muren moves slowly forward. Ball crosses halfway. Staples and then Stevens tangling. Stevens again winning. You've heard it before. I'll say it again. He's had an absolutely superb game. Gary Stevens trying it with that equalizing goal that has put this final into extra time. Muren now for Manchester United. Muren. Muren back towards McQueen on halfway. Far side of the field. United left. Leigh Wilkins nearly stumbles in a divot. Then plays it inside to Muren. Back to McQueen it goes. McQueen looking ever so slightly the worst for where. He's had a tough 90 minutes. They all have but he's used it with a tougher 90 minutes in motion. His pass forward not a good one. Stevens cuts it out to Ryan. Ryan looks for the return to Stevens. He played it instead out of play. So United of a throw. Manchester United then. Far side. They're left. Back it goes to Robson. Middle of the Brighton half. Over towards the Far side. Again to the Far side it goes to Albertson. Inter Muren on the angle of the area. Pierce comes into the action and Ryan too and Brighton clear their line. Robinson heads it on in the centre circle. Nobody forwards. Dufferley claims it's United. Seven minutes to almost of extra time gone. United try to mountain attack. Howlitz puts the ball out of play. Throw to Manchester United then on the near side which is their right. Mike Dufferley another one of the stuff is around the back. They'll take it. The usual piece of advice. Throw in his way. Hold it. Think of this thing. They'll do anything rather than hold it. Ryan gets this last settle once and for all. Bailey comes off his line. The ball plays through the war zone. He's outside his area. Plays it to Albertson on the near side. And Albertson helps it on to Muren. Muren chips it forward. Stevens again. Ever dependable. Always there. And Brighton wants more. Now with Gatton. Mosley wants it. Gatton gives it to him. And Mosley on the edge of his penalty area. Prepares to send it long. Waits until his man gets forward. And then sends it with the right foot. Halfway inside the Manchester United. McQueen rises and wins it. Albertson didn't challenge. Howlitz is in there on Wilkins. Wilkins running forward through two challenges. The tumble's over ground here. And that's the free kick to Manchester United. Wilkins picks himself off the floor and Mike Dufferley will take the free kick. Yeah, Wilkins holding his hamstring as well there. I think he's feeling a little bit tired. Many always have his socks on his ankles even from very early on. But I wouldn't be surprised if Ron actually thought of Ashley Green. Nice fresh pair of legs and a big strong guy. But so far he's resisted the temptation. Wilkins again in the action. Tangling there with Jimmy K. Stuff free. Beating the challenge with Howlitz. But Howlitz committed the foul to the referee. And so United have another free kick. What a yard inside the Brighton half-play forward there. Howlitz is on the left side. Tangling with K. from the edge of the penalty area. And it comes towards Wilkins once more. Hard by the touch side. Nearside. Wilkins chips it forward. The white side on the chest. White side plays it back once more to Wilkins. Midway inside the Brighton half. Still on the nearside. The right-hand side for United. Hurling cross from Wilkins. Ryan climbs high and heads it away. And that's the corner to Manchester United. And over-throttle Arnold Viren to take it. We're in the ninth minute of extra time. Arnold Viren. Flaps the ball up. The corner quadrant. Down to our right as we look. Nearside United's right. And Muren curls it. Left footed. Moseley comes out. He cries a punch for Queen-Heads. The whistle again is gone. Free kick for a foul on the goalkeeper. Well again I disagree with the referee there. George I thought I was a dangerous corner. Moseley came out to punch it and they missed it completely. Then he get pumped. But in the first instance of the...they got the ball. There was no foul at all. But the referee seemed to give the finish to the dole all the time to the goalkeeper. Moseley takes the free kick just to remind you that the Scottish Cup final two has gone into extra time. Rangers and Aberdeen were scoreless at the end of the 90 minutes. And it's still scoreless there. But it's 2-2 here as Robertson goes off and chase for Brighton. Heangles with McQueen. McQueen forced to concede the throw on the far side of the field. And so Brighton wants more mountain attack. Neal Smiley over there. Greenish is the man he aims for. Inside the box. Greenish shrugs off a challenge. Does well to get in there. It comes to Ryan. Ryan chips it towards Highlitz. But Duxbury is underneath that. Duxbury sends it straight up in the air. Davis is there to control it. And B. Highlitz. Wittgen's no good skill from Davis. Pays it into Wilkins. Wilkins forward ball looking there for Stapleton. But Stapleton immaculate interception at B. Stapleton. And then pokes it up the touch lines of Smiley. Smiley losing out to Alberston. But it's time to recover. But Steeves is so well there. Steeves is almost the least by Wilkins. But Steeves absolutely in the right place. Tackles time to perfection. And Brighton is a possession. And it's Steve Gadding. I love this cricketer playing for Brighton yet. Steve Gadding. Grung ball forward. Chased by Michael Robinson. Again McQueen goes in. It's the clearance of a tired man. It goes straight to Smiley on the far touch line. McQueen is stayed out there. Smiley plays it back inside the case. Case chips it towards Smith. Oh he's very nearly made contact. But Moran was there too. The ball goes out of play. And that's a goal kick to Manchester United. Yes Robinson put Goddumma Queen under a lot of pressure. They're a thinker. They've had it been earlier in the game. Goddumma Queen would have got to that ball. Probably a half a yard earlier in which he did. He certainly looked very tired. And he's had his socks on his ankles early on. And then rubbing his chest muscle. And if I remember the last cup final as well. He seemed to be in deep trouble in the extra time. Manchester United up on the attack once more. They get the attack moving. But Pierce is there to defy the white side of the chance. And back it goes to Graham Moser. Very hard to judge at a time like this. Flair is obviously not willing to exert themselves more than they have to. Conserve energy as much as possible. Having run flat out for the 90 minutes. But if anything to me it looks as if Manchester United are the more tired. However we shall see. Hardness transfer nothing in the allocation of medals. It goes in the back of the net. Both sides have got two. And the one that scores one on this extra time will claim the cup I'm sure. It's ducked free to be United. Deep in his own half. Place it inside the Wilkins. It's in the middle of that half. Wilkins helps it across to McQueen. The sun has gone in once more. Grey skies overhead once again as McQueen moves over the halfway line. Plays it forward to Muran. Who too is the stocking's Randy Ankel? Ryan snapping at his heels. Muran scampers off. Back into his own half. Then plays the diagonal ball. It's a Robson. Robson back to McQueen. 12 minutes of extra time gone. Who too the score? McQueen's long ball forward over the head of White Side and all the way through to Moseley. Moseley bowls it out to Gordon Smith. Smith to Gary Howlett. Howlett just inside his own half. Square ball inside to Smith once more. Here comes up into court. Smith has a look. Thinks about Greeley. Then thinks about Ryan on the far side. And Smiley too. And it's to Smiley that he plays the eventual pass. Smiley running out. Arbison. Smiley going to take on Arbison. Smiley gets across in. All the way across the face of the goal. And what's stuck for you? Puts it out for a corner. Well this little fella could certainly be the match winner for Bryant. I've been saying that all the time. But he only appears in the match for a few seconds at a time. And then he goes quiet again. But when he gets the ball out and up to the right flank there. He certainly has got the pace of Arbison. Who has a good throwback. But he's a very quick little lad. And that was a marvellous throw. He just needed to touch there and that could have been a goal for Bryant. Instead they've got a corner on the near side. They're left. Jimmy K takes it. Stumps it firmly. Robertson rising. Bailey flaps at it. Off it goes to the far side. Stevens is out there. Played back to Smiley. Manchester United's stream out. Smiley measures across. Gatting rises. Comes down towards Robertson. He can't control it. It's back to Howlett. Again they stream out. Howlett tries to shop the shot. Smith gets in the way. It comes out to Wilkins. It's right now. Men forward. And Manchester United can counter. Off goes Robbson. But there too is Bryant. Pressure in the legs of Robertson. Able to overtake him and get in the pass. Back to Graham Moseley. 90 seconds of the first period of extra time to go. And Gatting is the ball. Plays it forward for Robertson. But he's offside. United have a free kick. Well she's very little of a Varnal Muren in this first half of extra time. They could spell towards the end of the full-time normal time. But he's been really quiet now. And I'm surprised that Ron Actresson hasn't thought about Ashley Graham's and bringing them on. Because he's a big fit strong guy and he could really start running at the Bryant and defend. Well Manchester United has determined to end this first period of extra time in front. Or at least on the attack. But the throw that's taking place is a break. Throw in by Pierce. It goes stuck. He's up. He heads it down for Robertson. And then Wilkins and Nassby are in the middle of the right half. Forward looking for Robertson. But Gatting alive to the danger. I'm writing out a defense. Thumps it forward. Albuson though on the end of the clearance heads it back. But again it goes back to Manchester United in the first of Arnold Muren. Muren square ball to Duxbury. Duxbury up the line to Davis. Davis and Highleth tangling. Davis comes away with the ball. Davis plays it forward. Pierce commits himself again. White side gets it out to Duxbury. But this time Pierce is able to intercept it and shift it forward to Highleth. Highleth now for Gordon Smith in the middle of his own half. Plays it up to Greenish. Greenish rides the challenge of Wilkins in the center circle. He's just flying into his right. He's also got Jerry Ryan to his right. Ryan now moving up the right hand. Touch back for Brighton. Curves across. Albuson heads it away. And it comes towards Stapleson. Stapleson going up the left for Manchester United. Inside the Brighton half. Stevens stands off. Stapleson cuts inside. Ball bubbles in the divot. Stapleson into Davis. Davis 25 yards to go. Helps it on across the white side. White side. Left angle of the penalty area. Cutting in field. Blocked there by Ryan. And a foul given anyway or is it a... No, no foul. It's a half time. 50. Throw it all back to the second half of extra time. 15 minutes there as the whistle goes to decide whether it's going to be Brighton on their first ever cup final or Manchester United or whether it's going to be next Thursday night at 7.30. When here comes Brighton, halfway inside United half. All played wide. Near side to us. Robinson got smiley behind him. He's hemmed in by three United defenders. Round all clear. He plays the ball back. He leaves with a shot. A chance here for Smith. This is it. Goes wide. Good work though. Down the right. Robinson again brave. A missed hit by Greenish. He's now holding his head in his hands. He might have done better with that. Eventually the shot from Smith goes wide. Robinson was part of a few tired tackles there and played a nice ball back to Gruelich. But unfortunately it was on his wrong foot and he didn't make a very good attempt at it. But it actually went to another brain player who just couldn't go all over either. The ball on the halfway line. Far side from us. Howlitz for Brighton. Who's just inside United half. He's trying to go forward. McQueen will get a fortunate bubble on the ball and plays it wide from Mürden. Mürden with that left foot down the left. White side running well into space. Near side down United left. White side holds the ball. Still holds it. It has a look inside that right internal area. He's going out the defender here. In the end the ball hits Miley. Mürden comes canning in. Ball break. Greenish has got it for Brighton. Lays the ball out far side. Touchback by Smith. Case there. Case plays it wide. And Brighton will start again. Sia starting it off to Smith. Smith in field. Finds Greenish. Still inside his own half. The Brighton captain. Inside the center circle. Good ball for it. Robinson slips though as he was trying to control it. It's finally picked up by Mürden. Mürden again playing the ball down the left. Headed to the touchpad. Diving Jelly Ryan. The sun's gone in but nobody will care about the weather. It really has been a remarkable cup final here. It's 2-2 and we're now in the second period of extra time. McQueen for United on the halfway line. Short ball. Seagulls you can hear all around the stadium to my left. Wilkins score of a great second goal for United. Lays the ball wide once more. Duck spray down the line. Before Davis can really get hold of it. Snapping at his heels but he still gets the ball back. Touch forward by Mourden to Robson. Robson 10 yards inside the Brighton half and turns back the other way. Finds once more. Is full back. Duck spray. Duck spray looking for a red jersey. He's found the red jersey belonging to Kevin Mourden. Mourden to Robson. Robson turns. 1-2 with Wilkins. Robson trying to go forward. White side finds Rob Dan. And Mürsley comes off his line. Robson claiming that he was being held off the ball there. That was danger certainly for Brighton. Moseley came quick to help his line as Robson was storming in for the kill there. Brighton on the break themselves. Just inside their own half. Smith trying to get a bit too much skill there. He didn't quite come off. He's come back to make up for that but he's lost the ball. Wilkins back to Duck spray. Fast and furious despite those aching legs now. Mourden halfway inside the Brighton half. White side sweeps it out to the left. Albuson the full back there. Albuson to stay put and back to Albuson. Albuson tries to get the ball square. Relish is there though for Brighton. Hose the ball is being challenged by White side. In the end the catcher of the tired white leg gets the ball into touch. We've had three minutes of this last 50 minutes of extra time. Splendid atmosphere. And this certainly one of the finals to remember. Albuson. Robson. White side inside the Brighton area. Good skills by White side. Along cross to the far side. Staples and can't get there. That's the corner to Manchester United. But again White side turning on his six foot. Such good control by the young Irishman. And found the other Irishman stapled him almost. Corner then to Manchester United. And Mourden will take it. Again with that left foot of his backs away. Two or three strides. A packed Brighton penalty area. McQueen is up there on the line. Here comes the corner. Ball headed forward by Mouron for a moment as Stevens lost it. A spectacular overhead kick by Stevens. Still United though in possession. Albuson playing it wide. Mourden working. Working sites it up. A deflection comes off Robinson. It's still inside the area. White side battling for it. The ball comes across. Robson with a header. It's cleared by Brighton. It's still there on your yard from the goal line. Robson coming in down the left. Stunning Helsinghose is headed his hands alongside me. This really is nail biting stuff here. Two-two. Four minutes of extra time gone. Brighton two. Manchester United two. Ginny Case for Brighton. Just inside his own half. Lays the ball to Pierce. Moves inside the United half. Stabs the ball down that left flank. Smith back to Pierce. Pierce will find Ginny Case does so now. And then back once more to Grand Pierce. Cross from him. Oh just inside the man she's got a penalty. Had a chance here for Hullett. Hullett though in the end is crowded out. Lays the ball back though. Grealish is just outside United penalty area. Again he's forced away from the danger area by the United defenders. Lays the ball back to Case. Case sweeps a good ball out towards us. Ryan will pick it up in the outside right position. Finds Smiley almost on the white line. Smiley that blonde hair of his always in the action here. Moves the ball square. Grealish tries to spread it through the eye of the needle and can't have stable them. Find Wilkins. Wilkins a long ball and White side's offside. That yellow flag went up very smartly. Because White side was scampling on that one. Free kick then to Brighton. And it's about ten yards or so inside their own half. Five minutes have gone. Ten minutes of extra time remaining. A replay should there be one here in this same stadium. Thursday evening. Stevens with a free kick. Long ball forward. It's gone over the top of Robinson there and again Ducks be taking no chances. Any mistake made by Defender Narnie remembers for the rest of his life it resulted in a goal. Long kick from Bailey headed away though by Gatting. Ball inside the centre circle. Wilkins a little dip ball forward to Alberson. Alberson controls it then plays it forward. Stapleton trying to find Alberson with a return. Can't. Smiley comes in so does Mureen. Narnie got away from two but he can't get away from Wilkins who spins him away with a strong tackle. And certainly it's been no place for weak hearts down there on that pitch this afternoon. Ryan takes the throw. Back to Stevens. Splendid in defence and scored that equalising goal which brought this game into extra time. Stevens gets the return ball from his fellow central defender Gatting. Long ball from Stevens. A good ball onto the chest of Robinson. Can't quite find Smiley. Robinson goes back but Queen's too quick for him though. The Queen comes away. The subject run onto McQueen and then onto Robson. On the halfway line Robson down the United left. Long ball from him looking for White Side. Picked up there by Gatting. Stevens. And again Stevens looking so cool and calm about the whole proceedings lays it forward with a deflection and it drops to Wilkins. Mureen. Ken yards inside the right and half. Mureen again slowing it down. He's deceptively slow of course Mureen. Such style. Stable and gives it back to Mureen. Again Mureen. The cross from him. White Side turns away from the defender but Stevens stays with him. Finally he hits Stevens on the chest with his cross. The shot comes in. Gatting clears. On the halfway line and McQueen comes back very steadily. And the ball laid down to Mureen. Kenny can't control it. No he can't. Just a reminder that of course if there is a replay here next Thursday then Steve Foster the Brighton captain would be eligible to play. But Remy Moses would not be eligible to play for Manchester United. That's a talking point. But we are halfway through the second period of extra time here. Atmosphere track link. 2-2. Brighton relegates to the second division. I'm holding one of the most famous clubs in well almost in the world certainly. Manchester United. They're on the defensive at the moment. Mureen. And in the end he plays the ball off Grand Pierce to get the goal kick. Nobody particularly anxious to get it. Even the ball boy looks a little bit sluggish. He's left to one of the stewards to collect it for Gary Bailey. Bunches the ball back to him then. The beast barely looks as if in a bit of a hurry. Spots the ball up. Plays it short. Gets it back for Mureen. And certainly it's the Brighton supporters to our left. We've seen the most precipitous in these closing stages of this 1983 cup final. Long ball from Bailey. Difficult for defenders. And Stable then tries to go on to that deflected ball from Stevens. Gets there first to Mosley. Ryan playing a member in the right back position with Chris Ramsey injured. Back to Mosley. Just shakes his head for a moment. Has a long look upfield. Then tries to get maximum distance. It drops inside the United half headed away though by Alberston. And forward again McQueen. Felt the ball high into the sky. Drops on the halfway line. Davis goes to challenge for it. With the Blue Jersey's up right. It's Gatting still inside his own half and moves inside United half. Plays it towards us. Smiley is there. Smiley stabs the ball square. K skips over the challenge from Robbs. And another one from Stapleton and finds Gatting. Gatting just inside United half. Swips it wide. And again United have to defend here. Smith will find Grealish. Grealish plays it wide to Smiley. Still halfway inside United half. Smiley forward. Grealish tries the header. Robinson goes into the challenge. Ball cleared though by United finds White's cut. Always danger because White's cut is looking a much better player I think since he did it in the first half. Robbs know a lovely ball from Robbs. But Davis down the right far side of United. Good challenge will come in from here. And the loose ball drops to Dupstry. Wilkins. Wilkins holds and beckons to Claire to do what he wants them to do. The cross comes in headed away by who else? Gary Stevens. Ball inside the Brighton half with K's. K's chips the ball forward. Well the idea was right angle not quite right. And Robinson looking very tired indeed. And just had a score an extra time up at Hampton Park. And Eric Black has scored for Aberdeen. Aberdeen won Rangers Nill. Eric Black was quarter. So could it be two cuts for Aberdeen in two weeks? Gottenberg a triumph at the moment there. One nil up and of course already the Scottish holders. Aberdeen won Rangers Nill. Here at Wembley it's 2-2 an extra time. And we've got six minutes of extra time remaining. Brighton have possession inside their own half. Smith the ball runs away from him. But Gordon Smith runs across to retrieve it. And a fine smiley down below. A smiley going up to United defenders looking for a shot. The shot comes in high and wide. And a smiley shot. So Arthur Alderson sank to his knees. And if that one had gone into the top left hand corner I think Arthur Alderson would have stayed on the ground. Very very weirdy now. As you'd expect most of those players. Bailey short to Duxbury. Back to Bailey. Waving those gloves of his upfield. Go forward. Wilkins score. United's second goal. Finds Stapleton halfway inside the Brighton half. Finds Whiteside in turn. Robson running through and Stevens blocks it again. So often we've seen Robson running from deep positions to score sensational goals for Manchester United. Whiteside set it up but Stevens read it brilliantly. That once more to Moseley. Four and a half minutes of extra time remaining. Replay on Thursday if necessary. And up at Hamden Park. Aberdeen. A one up against Rangers. An extra time in the Scottish Cup final. Whiteside for United. Starts to move in field. Finds a space. Finds Müran. Müran with the cross. Ball headed away. There was Robson was coming in. And that was an illegal challenge at the referee in any case. So it's a free kick to Brighton. And Moseley again will spot the ball up. A yard inside the 18-yard area and gets the return ball from Gapping. You'll see the policeman getting to move around the ground at the moment. A sure sign that we're in the last few minutes of the game. Now then, can either of these sides just bring a laugh ounce from somewhere or a little flash of imagination or perhaps just a blunder by a defender to decide the FA Cup here this afternoon. Well, three minutes remain and Müran plays the ball wide to Staples and going down the left. Staples controls it just before it gets to the byline. He's being challenged though. Still finds Müran. It was a half across from Müran. And as Moseley came out, Stevens took no chances and felt it the ball away for a throw. Müran walks away rather weirdly to collect the ball from the crowd. Gets it now from the ball by 15 yards or so from the Brighton corner flag. Müran holds the ball above his head. Back once more to Alberston. Alberston with a cross with his left foot, not accurate, cleared by Case. Find Smith. Smith is brought down though by Morden. Free kick to Brighton. Just two and a half minutes to go. Agonizing stuff, of course, for both sets of supporters, not least for the teams themselves. The seed's immediately a belurse, the signalling and in fact both managers now holding up two fingers, not an ever seen gesture at all, but just to point out that we've got just over two minutes to go here. And that's on balance, it will be a shame if either have to lose, possibly four of a mistake in the closing minutes. Brighton will fort and fort, and United do come back from being one down. Smith for Brighton. McQueen is alongside him. Smith comes away, finds Smiley. The cross comes in from Smiley. Robinson gets up the challenge. Bailey did well. Because when Robinson challenges, you know somebody's challenging, he comes in with all the grace and softness of an agricultural remover, I would think. But Bailey did well. Hose the ball, takes the kick from his hands. It's a long, long kick too. Bounces, Stevens there. Oh, well, he headed the buff. So sure frustration for White's side. Because if it had gone another yard, if he had gone his left foot, he'd just padded it down with his hand. He knew. Charts of off-off from the Brighton supporters, but that's also done, I think, with a smile. White's side knew it. And it'll be a free kick again. Mosley will take it short to Stevens, just backheels it back to Mosley. A minute and a half to go of extra time. A long, long kick from Mosley. Headed away by Moren. Flies, Muren. Back to Moren. Still though, halfway inside his own half, really turns the ball to Wilkins. Wilkins checks, still hosed the ball. And I just heard from Hamden Park that Aberdeen have retained the Scottish cut. That Eric Black goes enough that one goal scored an extra try. And here, ball play for Robinson. Robinson going forward strong. He's inside the Manchester United Territory area. He fights Smith and Smith but scores, and he hasn't scored. And Bailey has saved it. Absolutely remarkable. Robinson just holds his head in his hands. Smith just had to score there. Robinson went inside the defender, kept his head, stroked the ball to Smith. All he had to do was really stroke the ball past the goalkeeper, and there goes the whistle for the end of extra time. And Gordon Smith will remember that moment for a very, very long time indeed. And Robinson well puts his head, his hands on his knees as if he couldn't believe that. A match played in marvellous spirit, very competitive indeed. A hard game for all players concerned. They shake hands and well they might. This one's going to a replay next Thursday. But my words back, it's going to be a match remembered for so many reasons. It's going to smash them, Mike. It's going to get better as it went on, actually. And Robinson done so well there, there were two Manchester United defenders, with very tired legs chasing them, but E-Man is just to keep in front of them. He was very unselfish and gave Gordon Smith a great chance. But unfortunately for him it landed in his right foot with it instead of his favourite left. And even then it just stuck under Gary Bailey's legs. But I was almost hoping that someone wouldn't score in the last few minutes because both teams have done so well for so long it has been almost a tragedy that somebody had to pinch it in the last couple of minutes. Well, certainly a remarkable final and just to remind you of course that Steve Foster now would be eligible to play in the replay here on Thursday. We're not now of course going to get the traditional... you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you",
