  "transcript": " And the influence that he still has, even at this stage of his career for Spain, is absolutely huge. And it is Spain who get us underway playing an all red Costa Rica in all whites. Spain playing from right to left in this first half. And Spain it is, who win the early throw over on the far side. We've had a shock defeat for Germany already in this group today. That is Spain's next match on Sunday. Can they take advantage or will they go the way of Germany and Argentina and suffer a shock defeat in their opener? Costa Rica know how to do that from 2014 they did it. They got out of the toughest group arguably at that tournament. And they have five players in this starting lineup who were in that squad eight years ago. But it's Spain in position and we know we'll be saying that a lot this evening. And they'll just knock it around between them. Rodry and Amarit Laporte. Of course, it's a position that we know Rodry has played for Spain and Manchester City, but clearly more usually used in that defensive midfield role. But as you say, Rob Green, it does give them the option to push him up into midfields. Where Spain have the ball now with Albert infield once more to Pedri. And now back to Rodry on the halfway line. Yeah, just looking at this Costa Rica mid shape and looking at the front two. Spain come down the right hand side approaching the Costa Rican penalty area. Good challenge. Show the back by the experienced Brian Oviedo, the former Everton and Sunderland man. And it goes out for a Spain corner. 90 seconds played. Torrey is on the right hand side. He's got the space because they're having such a narrow back line, such a narrow midfield for Campbell and Contreras in up front. Realize the importance of busquets. Both of them dropping and sitting on busquets. It's going to be tight in there. So early test for the Costa Rican back line and Kailor Navas 35 years old as the Spain corner is swung in. It's met by Costa Rica and sent up towards the halfway line and all the way back by Spain. A first touch for Unite. Simon in the Spain goal. So good to see how he recovered from what was a real error against Croatia at the Euros. Overall, a decent tournament for for Simon, but it's one of those things that mentally is a goalkeeper. You just don't know what it's going to do to a young goalkeeper and he's come through it, played well since then and very much established as the Spain number one. Yeah, it's good to see. Good to see and get a chance and the confidence of a manager to say, I need him. I need he's good with his feet. Yes, he plays out. Yes, it looks shaky at times, but it's really important as to how they play. Just great stand for Spain outside the Costa Rican penalty area and Costa Rica will play it around. Charge down well by Daniolmo, but will be cleared away at the back by Francisco Calvo up towards halfway. Where Spain will win the header with baskets out to the right hand side. Just be kept in Costa Rica. Get the foot in, but Spain will pick it up once more just inside the Costa Rican half. Goal is here. Three minutes played as Jordi Alba picks it up for Spain on the left hand side and now forward to Ferran Torres back to Alba and the pattern is set. Spain passing it around. Lovely work there by Asensio played the ball in field. It's cut out by Celso Borges. Huge experience for Costa Rica and Costa Rica. Win the free kick as well midway and through their own half and we can take you through the team. So Simon in goal for Spain, the back four of Azpilicueta, Rodri, Laporte and Alba ahead of them. It's Gavi becoming their youngest World Cup debutants at just 18 years of age still. Busquets 34 years of age and Pedri 19. So the full range of ages there in the Spain midfield. And then forward is Ferran Torres, Asensio and Dani Olmo as Spain pick it up just outside the main penalty area. Costa Rica with Navas in goal. The back four of Martinez, Duarte, Calvo and Oviedo ahead of them. Minster Header and Borges, their most cap player with fuller Campbell formerly of Arsenal. And Jefferson Bennett off Sunderland supporting Contreras. He's had a remarkable rise with the national side up front. Here goes Ferran Torres down the left hand side for Spain in field two. Jordi Alba fall into the penalty area looking for the run at the far side and it's across the box and across past the far post from Dani Olmo. And behind for Costa Rica goal kick. Great chance for Spain inside the opening five minutes and Dani Olmo. Huge chance and Dani Olmo. It's an amazing opportunity on the volley because there's enough pace on the ball. He gets to see it all the way over to Defender's shoulder. Grimaces that they should thought of missing it because actually you're expecting him to at least hit the target with that big, big opportunity. Bit of a difficult bind for Costa Rica already. Do they go and press? Do they drop off? There they got it wrong. They press, they got played through, never really recovered in shape. And then they had the time to pick the pass from the field. Well, he has scored three goals for Ivy Leipzig this season. Dani Olmo, big opportunity there. Spain have it just inside their own half and spray it out to Rodri who plays it forward looking for Ascensio. Now out to the left hand side and Jordi Alba here is almost popping off in the left now. Well, marshalled out at the back by Carlos Martinez for Costa Rica and Costa Rica have a throw. Now, had to dive into my sticker book. All those commentators do it differently. I have little stickers with the nose. I realized when I was reading the lineup, guess who I put it right wing? Paul Torres rather than Ferran Torres. I looked at that. I thought that's not right. Ferran Torres it is and Spain win the ball back from Costa Rica on the halfway line. Six minutes gone, nil nil and Rodri in possession in the centre circle. I hate to tell you there's one in the Costa Rica team as well. Torres here, Torres there, Torres everywhere. Spain in possession just inside the Costa Rica half. It's back to the wall at the moment for the Costa Ricans and Spain switch the play out to the right hand side, but they won't keep that in and the ball goes out of play for a Costa Rica throw. Danny Ormoo and Ferran Torres have swapped a few times already in the shape of the game. I think that's going to be a feature with them high and wide in Costa Rica just playing the four at the back. They're going to have to ignore one, whether the ball's on the right, ignoring the right wing on the left, ignoring the far-sided player. And here they come once more with Pedri, the Barcelona 19-year-old, who lays it back to Busquets. He spreads the play to Jordi Alba, very much a Barcelona flavour about this Spain starting line-up as Pedri lifts it forward once more. Alba tried to play it back, half a shot for Handball. Ormoo will play the ball in and it's collected easily by Calonavas. I might well have been hit by the hand, but there's no chance of it being a Handball. So they've been quite adventurous in their shape Costa Rica. They're playing two up front almost. There's just so much space in there. People wanting to say Barcelona is the Barcelona players. It's the Spain players, but mainly the Barcelona players in midfield with the time and the space and the room to operate. Here is Azpilicueta, plays it out to the right-hand side. Well, Costa Rica, this won't be a surprise to them. They know, and their coach Luis Fernandez Suarez will know as well, that Spain are going to dominate the ball. It's about keeping your shape and trying to take those opportunities, get the ball forward to those attacking players underneath Contreras, almost amongst those. His dad actually quit his job, Contreras, to go and watch their intercontinental cut playoff win to get through to the World Cup. It was one of those where he was trying to get time off work. It was proving very difficult and he thought, No, I'm going to see my son. They got through. And I hope he's here today. Here is Pedri, plays it to the end. To the penalty area, just past the post from Asensio, who was coming in. Navas was diving, might have had it covered, but it's a lovely Spain move. Yeah, as you would imagine, the Spanish type of goal, the chance that they create, the one-touch football through the middle. And the midfield is just too split. Navas had it covered. It wasn't the greatest of strikes just wide, but you can see them just getting their angles, getting the combinations going up through the gears. It's going to be a tough, tough ride for Costa Rica to see this through. Navas, it is. He sends the goal kick long over the halfway line. It is flicked on through the run of Joel Campbell, but Spain get bodies in the way. And that's the thing for Spain in the back, Le Port and Rodri. So proficient in the air as well when called upon. Those high balls up from Costa Rica. Well, it's an interesting choice not to pick Garcia, and he's saying, well, he's not the biggest up against Campbell up there, and that's the out ball. That's what they'll look for. They need bodies around him, but with those two guys at the back, as you say, Vicky, it's going to be tough to get out. And here comes Spain. Aspilicüeza bursting down the right-hand side is Gavi Driffs into the box. Spain in the throat over on the far side. And aspilicüeza, the Chelsea captain will jog over to take preferred to Carvajal. Today Carvajal has been struggling with illness as has Marata, those two on the bench. But it also allows Spain to drop into that back three as well, which obviously several combinations of players can do. But aspilicüeza is certainly one of those if Carvajal is quite feeling 100%. And Olmo has it on the left-hand side for Spain here on five live in BBC Sound, all the way back to Imaric Laporte. He will square it to Rodri, Spain in possession on the halfway line. What a feeling. How the wear game is going now. They'll be happy. They don't need to change the shape, don't need to consider it. And they've stolen it back almost from Francisco Calva, who does really well there. He loses the ball initially in times to tackle well on the edge of the area, but Spain have it back once more. Here is Olmo, 30 yards out or so headed away once more by Calva inside his own penalty area, forward by Busquets out to the right-hand side and Gavi. Pedri's asking for it, central position. And it comes to him via the foot of Sergio Busquets out to the left-hand side and Jordi Alba now. And this is where it's just about concentration for Costa Rica as Spain zipping around. Alba whips it in, a little bit of space for Olmo. Will come to the edge of the box, dink through again, looking for Olmo, brings it down. Brilliantly, 1-0, Spain. It's a lovely goal from Dani Olmo. Lovely flowing move from Spain. And Olmo kept his cool, finished off past Navas. And it's Spain who take the lead, 1-0. Well, from the kickoff, it's been coming. 11 minutes in, and it was a matter of time. They're not getting tight Costa Rica. They don't know who to pick up. The movement's there, the stepping off the line, the stepping into the space. The runners in behind. Dani Olmo timed this one to perfection. Almost intercepted, almost bundled through. Just his space, his inclination to make the running behind, timed it to perfection. It's a cool finish as Navas comes out. But you have to say, they've looked good from the start. Only 10 minutes, they've had complete control from now on, you think? They're just going to grow in confidence and continue. So we are underway, the ball through. Just watching that replay from Gavi. It does get a bit of deflection on the way through. Dani Olmo able to bring it down, control it calmly, and slot it past Navas. So Spain with that early breakthrough in Costa Rica, trying to build down this right hand side with Joel Campbell. And the ball goes out of play for a Spain throw. Just in the build-up to that goal there as well. They had retained possession and then recycled possession. And it was all Busquets reading of the game, reading of that long ball out. And he just kept stepping in the way. I'll take that. Thank you very much. Let's go again. And his dictating, dictation of this game so far has been impeccable. So 12 minutes played. It's the champions of 2010 looking to avoid an upset. But as we know, Germany took the lead against Japan, Argentina took the lead against Saudi Arabia. You just never know at the World Cup. Costa Rica in possession. Play it back to Borges. And he will play it back into his own half. And this is Costa Rica's longest spell of possession. And it's been well-kept older by Colas Martinez. But his ball forward is ahead of Joel Campbell and La Porte into his penalty area. Will play it out very calmly to Jordi Alva. Nicely laid off by Busquets. Again, just the way that Spain interchange passes this so much. Oh, there you go. Commentators, curts straight away. The ball from Asensio is playing behind Dani Almo. But I maintain Rob Green. It's still the confidence with which they play. They know where each other are. Yes, they make the odd mistake. Of course they do. They're human. But it's just such a remarkable Spanish team. And he was through. He was in from the halfway line. He had the length of the pitch to go. And you know that they're playing with confidence. Busquets again on the edge of his own box. One touch outside of the boot pass out to the left back. And you just think, hold on a minute. They're playing a different game here to the Costa Ricans. Askele Queta over on the far side does just manage to keep it in. And the ball is all the way back with Rodgeri outside the Spain penalty area. Spain, who lead by the goal to nil Dani Almo after 11 minutes. As Bess gets plays it forward to Asincio, who just missed out on that Euro 2020 scores last summer when Spain of course reached the semifinals, only losing on penalties to Italy. But he was part of the young Spain side. One of their overage players that won silver at the Olympics that summer as Gavi goes down. Concedes the free kick does Francisco Calvo. And it will be a free kick to Spain midway through the Costa Rica half, just about level with the right hand side of that penalty area. Spain on Costa Rica nil. He's very, very fortunate there. One nil down should be a yellow card in as well because that was late. That was clinical. That's completely premeditated and he was way off the pace there. That should be a yellow. And he's a player that plays on the edge, isn't he? I mean, we've seen a great recovery tackle on the edge of his own penalty area after he'd made a mistake. And as you say there, the last thing you want 15 minutes in, one nil down already is to have one of your center halves on a yellow card when you're facing players with the trickery of Spain. Spain, it is standing over his free kick on the far side. Little layoff now will be driven in by Pedri. He was looking for the 1-2 with Olmo. Red well by Costa Rica and here go Costa Rica with Jefferson Bennett, who goes down and Sunderland teenager wins the free kick over on the far side, midway through the Spain half. That was a really good free kick idea and they actually, the man in the one man wall backed off because he realized he was on his own and he was outnumbered. The space was there to run into, but they'd obviously practiced this in training. I thought, well, I better do it because this is what we practice in training rather than thinking on your feet and saying, I've got 10 yards to run into. 16 minutes gone. Spain need one nil on five live in BBC Sounds. Costa Rica free kick just inside the Spain half, which will be taken from the wide left position. Joel Campbell from Arsenal man is over it, sends it to the right hand side. Caval was up there wins the header, but the flag is up on this near side and it will be a free kick to Spain inside the main penalty area. Well, it was nearly a touch in the Spain penalty area, but he was offside. He timed it just a fraction too early. I'm saying at the start, the game that you could see where Contreras and Campbell, both of them were sitting on buskets and they realized how dangerous he was. Well, as soon as I said it, both of them stopped doing it. And from that point, he's completely been in complete control of this game. And Spain in control of the school line as well. One nil they lead as Roger E brings it up towards the halfway line. We've already had our latest shock of the World Cup today. If you're just joining us Japan to one winners coming from behind against Germany. That's after Morocco drew nil nil with Croatia and one more match for you to come on five live and BBC sounds Belgium against Canada. 7pm kickoff with John Murray and Dion Dublin in possession of Spain in the center circle. Here is Pedri out to the left hand side and to the Albert lays it off to the gold scorer. Danny Olmo, who cuts in field from that left wing, tries the one to with Albert, but it's intercepted well by Tejeda of Costa Rica and he wins the free kick as well. And it will be a free kick to Costa Rica midway through their own heart. Yeah, they're just not getting this right. There's three or four of them pressing in the back in the same again in the Spain half. But you're looking at that midfield. They're so good technically on the ball. They've just play through that. They realize where the space is. They know which which of their teammates has got the space and so they can play through that press and then they're straight in at the back line. You've got to do it as a unit. You've got to do it as a team. You can't do it in threes and fours. Spain in position with Pedre plays it out to the left and Jordi Alba back to Emericlaport and the control that Spain are enjoying at the moment. I mean, it's hard to overstate. They've got the goal leads. They're comfortable as we know in position. Oh, there you go. That's all I need to do is keep saying it because every time I wax lyrical about how they're doing it, Spain played out of play and I swear to you that's the second time they've done that. And both times I've been talking about it. So there we go. We know what we what we need to do if we want to gain on our hands. You're giving Costa Rica hope, but behind the goal to our right hand side, there's a pocket of Costa Rica and traveling fans and they've been lively at the start before the kickoff. Very, very subdued now. Here they come. They might rise behind that goal and they do as one as Joel Campbell comes down the right hand side outside the Spain penalty area. He's well marshaled away by Amaric Laporte, who just stepped up from that back line out to the left wing. Costa Rica will play it forwards once more as they work it down this right hand side with Martinez back to Joel Campbell, who whips the ball in left footed. Costa Rica are players over on that far side. Important head of one away by Spain forward to Ferran Torres, who goes down. The referee says no foul and Costa Rica will come forwards once more, but they stopped in their tracks and now the red shirts will flow over the halfway line and here is the goal scorer. Dani Olmo left hand side approaching the penalty area, but will stop and check and send it back to Marco Asensio. I'm honest, I thought the whistle had gone there because it really did start and stopped a walking pace, but Spain have worked it out to the right hand side now and the momentum of that Costa Rican attack is gone. Spain look to build their own momentum, ticking through the gears out to the left hand side and Jordi Alba in field now to Asensio, who will stop and check and play it back once more and Busquets is there. He's closed down well by Tejeda, but steers the play out to the right hand side and Azpilicueta with Ferran Torres ahead of him back to Azpilicueta. Spain wants more back to the halfway line with Amaric Laporte. It's so, so difficult as a proposition for Costa Rica. They're pretty much doing all they can do now. It's sitting in this 4-4-2, but it's such a tight and narrow 4-4-2. It's just 10 bodies in the way because they go to press. They just can't get round such a wide vast space of these pitches and you stand there. It feels so big when you're a player in this pitch. And they're finding space on the left hand side now. Jordi Alba whips the ball in. Oh, that's a brilliant goal. It's met fabulously by Asensio. First time, brilliant ball from Alba. Brilliant finish from Asensio. Spanley Costa Rica 2-0. It was a wonderful finish and a wonderful goal. All of a sudden just bided their time, waited, waited for the moment to pounce. And as I was saying, Costa Rica have got to go tight, got to go narrow. That provides the space out wide. One fast ball out wide, one fast ball into the box. One touch finish. They're in complete control of this in early, early, early fashion of this game. And you know what? If we're talking about shocks at this World Cup, it's what Germany didn't do. It's what Argentina didn't do. They've got the second goal. Yep. And he's just looking at the replay. It comes so quick from Asensio. Kailor Navas you're thinking, Oh, can he do a bit better? Guts his hand to it, but it's just the speed of it. Your fate, your head will be turning with the ball. You're not sure where that run's going to come in. When it's going to be met and it's such a clean, crisp finish off the in-step of Asensio. It's past it before he can get any power into the dive. It's difficult for Navas. It's going to be even more difficult for Costa Rica now. Yeah, real mountain decline for the side that got out of the toughest group at the World Cup back in 2014. Five of those players were involved in that campaign, but they're trailing by two goals to nil. And they didn't have to come from two goals down in any of those games as Gavi comes forward. Spain really with a bit between their teeth now here is Ferran Torres plays it in its block behind off of Viedo. It's a Spain corner. It is all Spain. They're flowing. They really are flowing. Pat touched on it before the game. He's saying, look, you can see the form of Costa Rica. We know this one games. We just don't know how good they are because they've not played teams of the quality of Spain. Looking at it now, you're thinking this could be a struggle for a World Cup. So corner to Spain over on the far side, leading by two goals to nil and utterly dominant here on five live and BBC sounds. They have a little arc, a red arc of players, Spain. If they want to play a short option and then another one and then another one to work it to the edge of the day. Surprising if they did. Yeah, it could play it all around the edge of the box and finish with a shot. We'll just go back to a nice team on. Well, you'll put the kids of death on them now and they'll kick off. Let's see. Have a feeling Costa Rica are going to need all the help they can get even if it's from us. Corner to Spain over on the far side, leading by two goals to nil. They work from this set piece. Swung into the edge of the six yard box cleared away by Costa Rica up towards the halfway line. Jordi Alba is there and sends it back up over his shoulder towards the penalty area will bounce kindly for Gavi almost muscled out of it by Contreras, who is the first time we've mentioned the Costa Rican forward outside his own penalty area and he's lost it to Essenceo pulls the ball across block behind off to Arte. But it did take a Nick back off Essenceo and it will be a goal kick to Costa Rica. How brilliant from Gavi because he knew he was going to get hit. He knew and he's not the biggest in any way, shape or form. I'll tell you what, I'm up for this. I'll take a blow. Won the ball, gave his teammate a chance and it was unfortunate. What Navas did was go quickly for the spare ball. I'm thinking I'd take all the time I want right now because you've got a long old 65 minutes left here, lad. Spain in possession midway through their own half leading by two goals to nil from Olmo and Essenceo out to the left hand side. They come with Jordi Alba and now Pedri. Olmo will send it back to Alba and Pedri wants more and Spain will go all the way back into their own half with La Porte. Four games for you tomorrow on five live in BBC Sounds, including one of the favourites Brazil. Rick Edwards will be live from Doha from 6am on five live breakfast. Now it's on the right hand side is Gavi, his Busquets, plays it back to us, Pilaqueta and Rodgerie. It's just rhythmic, isn't it? It's wonderful to watch out the plan and yes Costa Rica is struggling. I played against that wonderful team from Spain just over 10 years ago now and it's got a similar feel to it. The team in white stood there looking at each other going, what do we do here? Because we haven't got an answer right now. Do you know Spain League? Costa Rica have stolen it though on the halfway line and it's a good bursting run by Jefferson Bennett of Sunderland. He's well dispossessed, but I'll tell you what there, he gave the Spain back line a little something to think about there. Good pace, good skill. That's why Rodgerie's in the team. That's the role he has at Manchester City. In front of the back four, he just did it as a centre back there. Sensor danger stepped across. Really good tackle and again, so dispiriting because you get that little inkling. You think, oh, there's some space. It's gone. Spain in possession on the halfway line. He is their youngest debutant Costa Rica, Jefferson Bennett, yet to make his full debut for Sunderland, but already a real fan favourite thereafter arriving in the summer. Partly because him and his dad get the bus to and from training. Very down to earth, 18 year old and now he's making his world cup bow. His Costa Rica side though are 2-0 down to Spain. There's almost wins a throw over on this near side just up from the halfway line. I used to get the bus to training. There's never a fan's favourite though. I was going to say you probably were down to earth, so there you go. I was under earth. It was on the tube as well. Very good. Spain coming forward outside the penalty area. Lovely work by Gavi. Very good covering challenge by Tejeda, covering back there. Spain will bring it forward once more with a little glimpse, as we saw from Jefferson Bennett for Costa Rica of what Gavi, the 18 year old can do for Spain and he's on the ball again now. Space opens up a little bit ahead of him. He does a 360 and then plays it out to his piliqueta on the right-hand side. Here is Ferran Torres. Gavi wants more and Torres hugging that touch line, plays it back to his piliqueta. Spain leading by 2 goals to nil here on 5 live and BBC sounds. And Spain play it back into their own half. We've talked about the shocks for Germany and Argentina. How much does players, when you're in the position of Spain, think about, are affected by, talk about results like that elsewhere in the tournament? They'll use that as motivation and they'll see, put the game to bed early doors. Here you go, Stani Olmo down to the left-hand side of the penalty area. Oh, brilliant score by Chordiaba, not once, but twice, plays it back to Olmo once more. That was absolutely beautiful from the Spain fallback and you could hear the use around the stadium for it as Roger plays it forward and now Gavi Costa Rica cannot get a foot on the ball at the moment as Ferran Torres has it. Nice little back heel to tip to pass by, as since he outscored a Spain second, cleared away by Costa Rica, but it's all the way back with Inesimon. Party tricks are coming out already. You talk about going about it the right way, when you are the favourites, when you're talking about shocks and things like that. You say, when you're the better team, start the first 15 minutes well, go at it well. Let's show the right attitude. Wow, they've done that. First half an hour, they've been brilliant. They're in possession, Spain inside their own half. Do you think they will have talked specifically about the importance of getting the second goal, which Germany and Argentina didn't? I think just go out and play with this team. They'll just keep going because that's the only way they know, talk about the manager and the math messages he sends out and how he wants his team to play. That's what they do, Luis Enrique, that's how he wants them to play. Here goes Dani Olmo down the left-hand side for Spain. Open the scoring for them and they lead by two goals to 0-5 live in BBC Sounds. Here is Pedri outside the penalty area, tried the little 1-2. Costa Rica tried one themselves, little advisedly to clear, they haven't done. Spain tumbling the area into penalty. Very decisive decision pointing straight to the spot and Costa Rica have rueful grimaces on their faces. It was a good run by Jordi Alva, he went down. The penalty's been given and Spain inside the opening half an hour have a chance to make it 3-0. I just got it wrong and it's unfortunate because they were under so much pressure there. Looking at Duarte, he's the culprit of the tackle. It's just a horrible body shape that he gets himself into and it's a falling body that dictates where his leg goes. He makes contact, Jordi Alva goes down. It was the relentless pressure again that they won the recycling of the ball. They won the opportunity here again. They're at 6-0 and 7-0 at the back, just too much pressure on the back line. So, Kailor Navas, who's already conceded twice this evening, who had such a brilliant World Cup eight years ago, will have to try and keep out Ferran Torres. He was Spain's top scorer in the World Cup qualifiers and he has the chance to make it 3-0. The former Manchester City man from the spot. It's Ferran Torres against Kailor Navas and it's calmly done by Torres. It's rolled into the net. Navas went the wrong way and Spain are running away with this already inside the opening half an hour. It's Spain 3-0, Costa Ricanu. Well, that was clinical. They've been clinical so far. Very good penalty. Just a little hot, more pace in a run than a Georginio run up. Less of a hot, but enough just to give him that time to say which way you're going. Kailor, down you go. I'll go the other way. Thank you very much. 3-0, it's a cruise. It is indeed. It's plain sailing at the moment for Spain. And I'm sure there will be a smile on the face of Luis Enrique. Yes for the performance, yes for the goals, but as Guillain Ballet again was telling us before, it's his daughter's boyfriend as well. He's just made it 3-0. I wondered why he's on penalties. Well, he has stuck it in the back of the net. So from a tactical perspective, it makes sense as well. And Spain, very, very comfortable in the opening 31 minutes here on 5 Live and BBC Sounds. I guess the golden question now, Rob Green. And if you can answer it, you're a clever football journalist slash former footballer than me. What do Costa Ricanu do now? You just sit tight. The game's gone. The game's gone already. You don't sit tight and you say, look, use this as an education. Learn as much as you can from playing against some really, really good players. But what you don't do is go and take an absolute battering. And I see him on under a little bit of pressure from the back pass, plays the ball straight out of play. And Costa Rica do have a throw on the far side level with the edge of the penalty area. They go all the way back to Calvo, who spreads the ball out to the right-hand side. And Joel Campbell, lovely touch from the former Arsenal man to bring it down. He's challenged by Danny Olmo. Campbell stays down. Now, initially the throw was given, but our referee has deemed that it might be a little bit more than a throw there in Costa Rica. Have been given a free kick just in from that right-hand touch line level with the edge of the penalty area. They trail by three goals to now. Well, it was a needless tackle from all Danny Olmo. And looking at this by far and away, the best chance that Costa Rica have had. Wide out on the touch line as he's saved it. He putt its time, its possession in the Spain half and also obviously away from their own goal. So it will be their vastly experienced, also Borges, to take this free kick from the right-hand side. It's swung in, it's poor, it's almost played straight to Joel Campbell by Spain. The offside flag's gone up now. I think Marco Asensio will breathe a bit of a sigh of relief there. In fact, it was Jordi Alba back there playing his side almost into trouble and almost straight to Joel Campbell who had straight very much offside. Although interesting one that because if that's a deliberate play of the ball there from Jordi Alba, this is one of those things. It's the same law. If a defender deliberately plays the ball, then it can negate an offside. But Eiffel have released a load of guidance about what does constitute that. Interesting one that. Well, it was a clear deliberate play of the ball. The ball travelled 30 yards before he kicked it. And yeah, he was blankly offside in the fact that he was never actually onside. But it still came off a Spain play. And we've seen it before, we've seen it in bigger matches than this. We saw in the Champions League final it was a debatable decision, even with the letter of the law. And this is where it comes into it, the letter of the law and how someone interprets it is still different. They're still that inconsistency. Spain in possession just inside their own half. I think it was a Mexican Wave was trying to go round the stand there. Is it still going? Oh yeah, there it is. Well, that's the first one of this World Cup. That's code for the game is up. That's code for we know the result of this match. We've still got 10 minutes of this half and then another 45. So do stay with us listeners because Spain are coming forward again. Here is Daniela, we're into the penalty area. Tried to pull the ball across. That's a brilliant covering challenge. It sends it behind for a Spain corner. It would have been but the offside flag's gone out. Just going back to offside. It used to be simple, didn't it? Because also what you've got to look at there is is Joel Campbell becoming active by putting off Jordi Alba by being too close to him by trying to play the ball. I have to say in that instance, I don't think that was the case. And I think you're right that it was a deliberate play of the ball from Jordi Alba. Anyway, the referee and the assistant have said no. We'll give it as offside. But this is where subjectivity comes into it as the ball goes out of play for a Spain throw on the halfway line. Well, there's one thing that wasn't subjective about it. It was a really poor free kick and it's one of the few opportunities that Costa Rica have had to get forward and get numbers in the box. So far they've had two. One that they were offside from the first free kick that they had. And that, where they're offside, debatable, yes, but still hitting the near postman. Just the lack of quality. You know you've got to be your best against these guys. You know you've got to play a perfect game. It's been far from it. They are pressing as a pack, though, now Costa Rica, which is something that Rob Green wanted them to do. And they have won the ball back on the halfway line. It won't be latched on to by their forward Contreras. And it's cleared out of play for a Spain throw on the halfway line. Yeah, it's more of a contest then. All of a sudden it becomes a game in Spain's half. And you're playing in Spain's half and the pressure is in Spain's half. You're running the risk of getting pushed in, taking him behind and just getting run. But you know what? You're three-nil down already. What's there to lose? Spain in possession in the centre circle. Pedri brings it forward, plays the ball forward too much on it for Daniolmo. And it goes out of play for a Costa Rica throw. He doesn't stop. Utsunriki doesn't stop. Three-nil up, 36 minutes gone. Direct in traffic. He's got a huge technical area down in front of us. He's covering every blade of grass on there. Spain cleared the ball midway through the Costa Rica half with La Porte. It's brought away for Costa Rica by Borges. And that's a good ball out to the left-hand side. And Joeas and Bennett will cut in the Sunderland teenager. Cleared away by Spain. And then they've done well. Martialed, but again Bennett just looking lively. Looking like an outlet for Costa Rica if they can get him on that left-hand side. And they've done well to win it back with Calvo. Good little spell this for Costa Rica, but we put it in the context of Spain, leading by three goals to nil. Costa Rica come over the half-way line, forward to Cholcambal. And now Keisha Fuller down the right-hand side. First time he's really been able to get involved in the play since playing on the right wing. Can also fill in further back. And further back is where the white shirts have been for most of this match. But they're coming down the left-hand side now. Pulled back in field to Bennett, who's often another unlovely little skip to take him down to the byline. Pulls the ball across as well. Contreras is in there under pressure from Rodgery. And Busquets between them who marshaled them away out of the penalty area. Ball played back in. Powerful header by La Porte. And Costa Rica will pick it up on this near side with Fuller. Plays it back to Joel Campbell. Good spell this for Costa Rica. Again, they have the overload on the left-hand side. Pull the ball back into the penalty area. Rodgery with the header on the stretch. Gavi very, very calmly plays a bit of head tennis. Head 1-2 there, that was with Busquets. And he's been swiped up by Carlos Martinez, but he's still got it, Gavi. He's been fouled, Gavi. That was brilliant from the youngster. And he actually got a pat on the head there from Brian Oviedo of Costa Rica. He managed to get through the press on his own. Three of them played round them, but better from Costa Rica. A bit of concerted pressure on the back line of Spain. And you're looking at them a little bit more confident on the ball, a little bit more confident off it. Just need to do that until half-time and see themselves through. And it is six and a half minutes, plus added time to play at the end of this first half. Spain leading by three, Gostinil. Olmo, Asintio and Torres from the penalty spot. Costa Rica though enjoying their best spell of the game, but it's come as Rob Green says when the pressure is off and you feel, surely, that the game is already lost. I know you've had shocks in this World Cup, but I'll tell you what. Saudi Arabia and Japan would have to take a backseat. Of course, Costa Rica would have got anything from here, but we're still being treated to some lovely Spain football and some flashes of inspiration from Jefferson Bennett of Sunderland for Costa Rica. Spain in possession though, on the right-hand side, back to Gavi in field to Busquets, who will play the pass out to the right and as Pila Quiesa. Here is Ferran Torres back to Gavi once more. Busquets is just drifting forward in that central position as the crowds raise the noise inside the stadium. Stadium here, Spain leading by 3 goals to 0. Pedri out to the left-hand side and now Jordi Alba in front of Luis Enrique, who is standing with his arms in his black trouser pockets on the edge of his technical area, watching his Spain side work it out down. The right-hand side ball into the area. Torres was in there, Costa Rica get it away. As it flashes across the six-yard box picked up by Jordi Alba, it's getting to another period of the game and Costa Rica just can't clear their lines at the moment and Spain have it once more. Here is Ascensio, Busquets now in space, 35 yards out, trying to play the ball through once again. Wontful to Dani Olmo, cleared away by Martinez for Costa Rica and collected by Joel Campbell, who turns away from Jordi Alba, plays it in field. Costa Rica work it out well to the right-hand side and here they go with Queixha Fuller. A little bit of space opens up, well closed down by Spain and Pedri, who comes across to that left-back position in field to Borges and now Campbell once again turns into Pedri but does manage to smuggle it back to Borges. Campbell wants more for Costa Rica midway through the Spain half but they opt to go all the way back to the halfway line. Spain three Costa Rican ill as it's spread by Duarte who gave away that penalty for Spain's third. Out to the left-hand side, Spain run to the offside, not given, eventually the flag does go up as Costa Rica play the ball into the penalty area and it's a free kick to Spain. I mean, there's no point in waiting. I understand when they have to wait that it's actually if it's going to lead to a goal scorer an opportunity. He was 40 yards out, he was five yards offside. Just put your flag up, please. There's a brilliant moment there with Busquets where he didn't have the ball but he knew closing down, he's understanding of where it everywhere was. The only place that his opponent could get the ball to a teammate was through his legs. So he managed to close down with his leg shot. That takes some doing. And he's in possession in the centre circle, Spain leading by three goals to nil on five live and BBC sounds. A reminder that you can download the World Cup Daily podcast all throughout the tournament or the reaction, debate and analysis from BBC sounds. And if you're interested in listening to more about the wider issues around the World Cup in Qatar we've got a special episode of the sports desk for you as well which looks at all of that. Spain come down the right-hand side back in field two, Ascensio has an option to play the ball in fields of Pedri but will interchange passes inside instead. As Spain just knocking around once more leading by three goals to nil out to the left-hand side and Jordi Alba. Now in field two Pedri, nice little one-two attempted between Alamo and Ascensio. Cleared away by Costa Rica but only as far as Rodri and Navasquitz and Ascensio will drive well blocked by Borges up towards the halfway line but those little one-twos it's clearly something that, well we've seen them do it so many times, Spain but it's come out quite a lot in this first half. Yeah, what they do really well is find an area of space where three or four of them can congregate and they all just amass in one area and they buy the time to pick that spot and find that spot but they always have an outboard. They all have someone in space on the far side so when they do have run-out options they have that outboard and then when they do get it into that space where there is two, three, four of them they can do their little passes, do their little interchanges. Rodri in position for Spain, plays it out to the right-hand side and as Pila Queta only Laporte and Simon are inside the Spain half as Spain. Do you want to go all the way back to Unite? Simon, who has been a virtual spectator? I was just thinking that he's not touched it with his hands yet. And that tells you all you need to know. Spain come forward, Gavi almost getting in behind that Costa Rican back line sent back by La Vieira to Taylor Navas who clears the ball over the halfway line. Spain pick it up with Bascets and now as Pila Queta out to the right-hand side Ferran Torres is fouled and it will be a Spain free kick. He is hauled to his feet and Spain have the set piece and they've taken it quickly and Costa Rican just need to stay switched on here. They're in a good line at the back but Spain just pushing, just probing, just so comfortable with this Serena lead and the line share the dinosaurs share a possession. Well, they conceded in the 11th minute, the 21st minute, the 31st minute, that's some achievement, they've not conceded in the 41st, they've nearly made it to half-time. Good spots, Bascets plays it in field as Spain look to get this fourth goal as we enter the final minute of normal time at the end of this first half on five life and BBC sounds, Tudelaba flagged offside and there's some Rique down there, applauding, pointing, always involved as Rob Green says. Contract is up with Spain at the end of the year, incidentally. He says he won't sign a new one until after the World Cup because if things go wrong, you, and by that he means the media, won't have to ask me to be fired. Well, he's a fitness fanatic, isn't he? And it's a good job really because the amount of energy he expends on the touchline is incredible. Spain collect the ball outside their own penalty area. Did you see that? We just almost got taken out by a pigeon. There it is, all off it goes again, right to left. That was a close one. Keep an eye on it, Rob, as Spain play the ball away from their own penalty area. Navas has come a long way out of his penalty area to collect it, but does so calmly under little pressure and he'll clear the ball. Eventually, up towards our point. Now, we'll pick it up first and he's doing what you said he should do at 2-0. He's doing it at 3-0. He's just taking his time as we're into added time at the end of the first time. We just heard that there was five minutes added time, which, other than the gold celebrations, there's not been a stoppage, barely. Wetzel's already gone. Joel Campbell does go from range for Costa Rica and it bounces on the roof in the net anyway. Well, it's something they are looking at at this World Cup, basically any stoppage that they're being very precise about how they measure it. So we've had a penalty award, we've had two other goals, but as you say, and also because Spain are so proficient in possession, the ball's been in play the vast majority of the time, other than when we've said they're doing really well and they kick it straight out. Oh, they've done it again. Yes, they have. It's three out of three. Well, you've scored three. Costa Rica haven't, but I'll be interested to see how many passes that Spain are putting in this first half, because it is, yes, they've been allowed to do it, but it has been a huge amount of possession and it's been so comfortable. They've just bopped it around at will, really. Costa Rica trying to build down the left-hand side with Bennett once again. He's putting on a little bit of pressure. The ball is all the way back to Unazimon and Spain will work it out with Rodri coming out of that penalty area, off to Busquets now. His ball just ahead of Pedri, but will roll to Olmo as the ball is played back to Busquets in the centre circle. Reminder coverage of every match from the World Cup on five live and BBC Sounds across the tournament, including one more this evening, Belgium against Canada, seven o'clock with John Murray and Dion Dublin. Here, Spain comfortable, very much so, leading by three goals to nil. Here is the port, picks it up midway through the Spain half and into changes with Busquets and now Rodri will play the ball through to Gavi driving towards a penalty area. He's just stopped his run, so the ball is ahead of him into the box and cleared away at the back by Fuller after a Spain throw. You don't realise how good your teammate is. That's when that happens, is that you see the space you go and you think, oh, he's never going to make it that pass in there. And he realised, actually, he's really, really good. He can make that pass and he did and I should have carried that run on. So, Spain in possession on the halfway line. Costa Rica have switched to this back five for now, so Fuller has dropped back into that right back position. He's stepping up now. It's one of those that they can switch when they get into possession, but there just seems so few of them at the moment. So, a little tactical tweak there from Luis Fernando Suarez because they're just trying to stop the sweeping, flowing Spain moves forward. Spain, it was two minutes of added time to play at the end of this first half lead by three goals to nil. Yeah, we thought it might be the case before the game. Pat touched on it and you were just wondering because they do effectively have two right backs in the side and it does allow them to do that. But what it does do is just have a man less in midfield and so it makes it that bit easier for Spain. Now, referee stop play here. Will it be a free kick to Spain? He almost hit him and he almost didn't stop, which he has to do another directive that's come in over recent years and it wasn't till a sense. He looked at me and said, what are you doing? Oh, yeah, sorry. Maybe he's checked out before half time as well. He shouldn't put five minutes up. To be fair, that's the fourth official. Pedri in possession, Spain leading by three goals to nil as Roger picks it up in the center circle. Lovely track back from Busquets to find Pedri as Spain suddenly accelerate through the gears looking for this fourth goal into the penalty area. It goes as Sinccio great sliding covering challenge at the back from Duarte. And the block was enough to put off a Sinccio and it's behind for the Costa Rica goal kick. Yeah, good enough to put him off and good enough to also not give away the corner because the ball was travelling at such an angle for a Sinccio, but it was his dropping that played a Sinccio onside again. It's just the slickness of the pass in the ease of the passing, the ease of this first half. And it has been very easy for Spain. Simon, who gathers the ball has had very, very little to do as Rob Green says. At least touch the ball with his hands now, but just to roll it out. Yep, 50 minutes in and it'll be pleased for the touch, shall we say. And there is the half time whistle, a half that has gone very, very well for Spain. They've seen Germany falter, they've seen Argentina falter in their openers at this World Cup. But from here, Spain do not look like faltering. 3-0, they lead Costa Rica and Rob Green, it's been as dominant as a performance as Luis Enrique could wish for. Yeah, there was a number of question marks at the start of the game as how Barcelona were going to play, as Spain were going to play in terms of being able to break down Costa Rica. And it has been the Barcelona players, it has been Busquets, it has been Pedri and Gavi that have Sean Alba on the left. And you're looking at those guys and the pleasure that they've been playing with each other and the understanding that they have with each other that going through, cutting through this Costa Rica team has been at ease. It's been really entertaining to watch from a Spain perspective, but Kelly, I'm sorry, I don't think we're going to have a shock for you here. Very nice stuff from Spain, that is worth watching. Indeed. But it is good to hear about that fantastic Spain performance and to have a competition in which Spain are on the kind of form that we're looking at just now is going to be very exciting. Spain then, as Vicky was saying, 3-0 up against Costa Rica at halftime. For now, thank you very much to Vicky Sparks and to Rob Green. We'll be back at the Alta Mama Stadium for the second half of that one. We'll also be with a jubilant Japan after their shock 2-1 win over Germany earlier. We'll check in with Dion Dublin as well. He's one half of our commentary team for the fourth game of the day. That's back to Group F and that is Belgium against Canada. Earlier on in that same group, it finished Morocco nil, Croatia nil. So we'll look ahead to the rest of the games to come today, or the game and a half to come today after the BBC News with Richard Foster. Take the World Cup with you, Qatar 2022. On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live. Nicola Sturgeon says the next general election will be a de facto referendum on Scottish independence. She's lost her legal case to try to force another vote without the consent of the Westminster Government, which so far it's refused. The former Supreme Court Justice Lord Sumption says the result was never in doubt. The Scottish Parliament cannot deal with reserved matters, and those include matters relating to the Union of England and Scotland. It seems perfectly obvious, but an act of the Scottish Parliament authorising a referendum on independence would relate to a union, the Union of England and Scotland. It would extinguish it.

They're just one part of it, but they're the part that really excites the public's imagination. So showing that the space industry as a whole is welcoming of people from all backgrounds is a really important message to send.

That's because of emergency bridge repairs. Congestion is back to Brackley at Junction 10. And in London on the A406 north circular northbound, there's two lanes closed at Coney Hatch interchange. That's because of an accident earlier and subsequent repair work. Congestion is back to Finchley. Ellie Brennan, five live travel. It's 50 years since England and Scotland's first ever official women's international. We were just girls playing football, but we didn't realise we were making history. I'm Anita Assanti. In my new podcast series, I'm going to learn more about the women who played that day in 1972. I went past one person and shot and at least gave us a chance. We were two two then. And how it led to a brighter future for the Scottish game and onto England's Euro 2022 glory. I feel so lucky listening to those stories. Attitudes like that are what has taken the game to how it is today. My moments in history, kicking off the women's game on BBC Sound. BBC Five Live. The FIFA World Cup, Qatar 2022 with Kelly Kate. Alba whips it in, a little bit of space for Olmo. We'll stink through again, looking for Olmo, brings it down. Brilliantly! One nil, Spain! It's a lovely goal from Danny Olmo. Running space on the left hand side now, Jordi Alba whips the ball in. Oh, that's a brilliant goal. It's met fabulously by Asensio. First time, brilliant ball from Alba, brilliant finish from Asensio. Spanley Costa Rica two nil. The penalties been given and Spain inside the opening half an hour have a chance to make it three nil. Spedán Torres against Caelo Navas. And it's calmly done by Torres. It's rolled into the net. Navas went the wrong way and Spain are running away with this already. They are three nil up at half time against Costa Rica. We'll be back to the Altamama Stadium for the second half of that one with Vicki Sparks and Rob Green very shortly. Then at seven o'clock, it's Belgium against Canada. Full commentary of that as there is of every single game throughout this World Cup. And as we heard earlier, a huge story as Japan came from one nil down to beat Germany 2-1. The winning goal scored by Takuma Asano. Lovely touch by Asano. Into the penalty area. Asano! What a finish! Oh my word! What a sting in the tail! But what a touch! High ball downfield! Asano killed it, then right footed and then rifled the ball past Noya. Did the dream come true? Yes, we could do it. We had a dream like this today, but we just could do it. Did you watch Argentina yesterday? It's similar for you? Yes, we watched that game. We thought we can do it. We just did it today. Only that. They thought they could do it and they did. Takuma Asano there speaking after his goal, which saw Japan beat Germany by two goals to one. I'm not sure anyone enjoyed it more than Chris Sutton as the co-commentator in that game. Maybe apart from football journalist Dan Olavitz, who covers Japanese football and joins us now from Tokyo. Dan, what an unexpected result by everyone except Chris Sutton who said that he predicted it. But I'm not sure everybody else was quite a sanguine. You know what? I don't think that any of us, given the expectations we had for this Japan side heading into this game, would have expected to one win. And I say that knowing how much potential this squad has, this is an incredible result. Probably the biggest result in the history of Japanese football. This is incredible. I'm running out of words and maybe because it's 2am here. I'd imagine there's a lot of people not sleeping at the moment. The excitement of that result is so huge and we saw the celebrations of the squad, the players, the backroom staff. Everybody was on the pitch after the game in a huddle on the touchline celebrating that result. What's the reaction being like in Tokyo and across Japan? Fans here in Tokyo are jubilant. The famous scramble crossing in Shibuya. That is where fans who have been watching games at bars congregate after World Cup games and it's been packed immediately after around midnight when the last trains have basically already left the station. You see just thousands of them celebrating in the crossing. Of course, when there's a red light and they're allowed to cross, I think people are stunned. You looked at the first half and how tight it was and you weren't quite sure. You figured maybe Japan can fight back and get the draw. But again, you look at what Saudi Arabia did to Argentina yesterday and you start thinking, well, maybe it is possible, even against Germany. Germany that outpassed Japan up and down the pitch and then they went and did it. As you said, there is a very technically gifted Japan side that hasn't quite reached the heights that it potentially could. Does this mark a turning point for this Japan squad? I think that this game gives Japan confidence and that's the one thing that they really needed. We saw a very hesitant Japan in the first half and then Moriatsu made the changes that he did and that really turned the game around. I think now you realize, well, if you can play like this for 45 minutes, you can play like this for 90 minutes and you can't just play this for 90 minutes against Costa Rica, but you can play those 90 minutes against Spain and then quite possibly whoever Japan will face in the round of 16. So that confidence and that conviction that they can beat the world's best will take them as far as they want to go in this tournament. It was so exciting watching them. As you said, there's been so much excitement in Japan and now there will be a degree, maybe not of expectation, but certainly of renewed hope. We saw after Saudi Arabia got their fantastic win against Argentina, there was a national holiday. I can't imagine any plans like that across the cards. It's not quite that big an upset, is it? The funny thing is that today, Wednesday, was actually a national holiday. Oh, was it? Labor Thanksgiving. So people had time to relax today and enjoy the game, however they did, but I'm sure there will be a lot of bleary eyes and coffee consumption at work in the morning. It's going to be a tough one for a lot of fans here. The game finished at midnight. But if there was any question of how excited the Japanese public is for this World Cup, it has been answered. It's going to be an amazing atmosphere and amazing buzz in this country for the last two group stage games. Dan, thanks so much for staying up to the early hours of the morning to talk to us. Appreciate it. No problem. Thanks for having me. Thank you very much to Dan Olavitz there who covers Japanese football in Tokyo, reflecting on that fantastic result for Japan earlier on. And certainly, of course, on the receiving end of that defeat earlier this afternoon, here's Ilkay Gundewin's reaction. We have no other choice, to be honest, than to try to be confident and play on the best possible level. Unfortunately, because of the result today, that's already our first final. So every game now is going to be a final. I think it could have been better if we would have won today, obviously. The pressure wouldn't be that high, but now with that result today, we have to win it. I think in general, with the performance, we know there is maybe still a lack of certain things. But when you look just on paper, I think we were quite dominant. At the end of the day, we had the chances to score earlier, the second one, even the third one, to be honest. The keeper was also doing well, we had the post, I think the crossbar once, and I had the post. So yeah, I don't think we played that bad, to be honest. That was Ilkay Gundewin and German football journalist Marie Schulter-Bockum is with us now. Marie, I don't think anybody saw that coming and they certainly didn't see it coming after about an hour of that game. Yeah, you're right. On paper, it was very much an unbalanced game. By the final whistle, Germany had nine shots on target, but the only goal that they did score was a penalty kick. So as Ilkay Gundewin said in his answer, it's also a tale of missed opportunities. Because of that, because of the chances that Germany created, because of the chances that they missed, how much of a reaction has there been to that defeat? Is it seen as something that is just one of those things that happens in football, or are there questions being asked about this Germany squad? I would say Germany is a very proud footballing nation where all the fans and the public, and even the players themselves, very much expected to win this game against Japan. So the reception to this result is very bad. People are unhappy. People are being criticised. And for once, I guess the focus is now on the sport and the lack of a performance. Because in the last few days, ever since Monday, where it was announced that Germany wouldn't be wearing the one love armband, that Captain Manuel Neuer would not be wearing that, that has been the focus of the discussion in Germany. It's all been about human rights. You had German supermarkets, chain, Riva, which is equivalent to maybe a Sainsbury's or Tessco's that size. They're one of the key sponsors of the German national team. They pulled out as a reaction to Germany kind of giving in to FIFA. And then of course we had that moment before the game where for the official team photo, the German players covered their mouths as if they had been silenced. So the storyline up to now has been very much off the pitch. But now with this result, I expect the public and the media in Germany to focus a lot more on the downside of the performance on the pitch as well. Marie, thank you very much for joining us. Marie Schulte-Bockham there to reflect on Germany's defeat by Japan. We will be back to the Altimarmus Stadium very shortly where the second half is just about to get underway. Rob Green and Vicky Sparks will take us through that very quickly though. Dion Dublin is going to be working on Belgium against Canada. You'll be bringing us every kick of the ball in that one from 7 o'clock. Dion, what are you expecting? Energy from Canada. Energy, very young manager, but they've got some exciting players all about Alfonso Davies. He's a key player for them. If they can keep him quiet then I'm imagining this. If they get it right, it could be an easy night for Belgium. They've got so many good players. We know how strong their squad is. So they have to stay in the game, Canada. And they might surprise a few people with their energy levels, but the quality is all in that Belgium dressing room. We've already had shock so far in this World Cup. Dion, thank you very much for joining us. Belgium, Canada is live on BBC One later, and that means you can watch all the match build up via the iPlayer with five lives coverage on the top of it.

Just search for World Cup Extra on BBC iPlayer. Rachel Burden, if you're listening, I heard on breakfast she's having a few technical difficulties in managing to do that. Search for World Cup Extra on BBC iPlayer. Tune in for Rick and Rachel first thing in the morning from six o'clock. Now, though, with Spain three-nil up against Costa Rica, the second half underway at the Altamama Stadium is Rob Green and Vicki Sparks. Thanks, Kelly. Yes, 90 seconds played. Spain leading Costa Rica by three goals to nil, and Costa Rica have made a change at halftime in the back line. So, the Waston is on and Carlos Martinez has been replaced. So, it looks as though Costa Rica are starting this second half with the back four. They did end with a back five having started the match with the back four. So, interesting to see how that develops, but Spain in possession leading by three goals to nil. And the message from Luis Enrique Rob Green would be what coming out into the second half? Enjoy yourselves more of the same. You played with absolute joy in that first half. So much confidence against the side. Who let you? Who let you play how you want to play if you asked him how would you like Costa Rica to turn up and how would you like? What shape would you like them to play? They pretty much did it for them. Hopefully, for their sake, they'll put different shape out, different formation, different performance. Spain, though, putting in the same performance as Sencio from the edge of the box just over the bar. As Pilar Queta was cutting in from the right-hand side, Federer Sencio on the edge of the D. He's already scored once this evening. It's over the bar and into those Costa Rica fans away to our right. Yeah, it's a four, two, three, one that Costa Rica has set up in in the second half defensively, but that just creates space in front of the full backs and says, alright, Pilar Queta, my old teammate Chelsea is a clever guy. He'll work that out pretty quick and he walks straight into that space, drove inside, and it's actually a wasteful opportunity stream from Sencio. You're expecting him on his favourite left foot to hit the target at least. So Costa Rica in possession, well, they were. They've just lost it with Joel Campbell all in white. They've won it back with Francisco Calvo, Spain, all in red playing from left-to-righters. Joel Campbell picks it up for Costa Rica down. The left-hand side goes Oviedo pulls it in a little bit of space for Jules and Bennett of Sunderland. Cleared away from him, though, and Baskets will play it forward looking for a Sencio over the halfway line. He goes Spain leading by three goals to nil. Here is Pedri outside the penalty area feeds Dani Olmo left-hand side of the box plays it forward. Navas is there and gathers easily just on the edge of that six-yard box. Yeah, they pick up the space so well on the break on that counter-attack. And this Spain side looks so threatening against Costa Rica. What I would say is, have we got any real blistering pace in the Spain team? And you're thinking in games in the future and you get against teams where they may need to break up pace. They may not get the luxury of all the ball that they've got in this first half at least. You're saying, OK, look at England, how they ran back, how they tracked back, how physical they were in closing down Iran. When you come up against the likes of the ties, you can do that. I wonder where they're going to come from and get that space and get that counter-attack going. Five minutes gone in this second half, Spain in possession on the halfway line with Pedri forward to the Sencio. Out to the left-hand side, they go once more and Dani Olmo will pick it up. And now Pedri wants more, switches the play to Azpilacueta on the halfway line and now back to Rodri, forward to Rosquette. Won't keep it in. And off he had the scream of frustration because he was coming up trying to start the Costa Rica counter-attack down the left-hand side. But had he lifted, it would have just gone out for a Costa Rica throw. Instead, he got a foot on it, couldn't control it. And it's a throw to Spain, which Azpilacueta will take. He was eyes bigger than his belly there. He could see the space in front of him and he knew that if he got the touch right by the chance he was on the stretch, he just couldn't get it right. Wasted possession. So Spain in possession inside their own half with Simon in goal. The back four of Azpilacueta, Rodri filling in at centre half today. Alongside his Manchester City teammate, Laporte and Albert make up the back line. Gavi, Busquets and Pedri in the midfield with Torres, Ascintio and Olmo up front. And it is that front three that have all netted for Spain this afternoon. Spain still in position just inside their own half with Laporte. An interesting role that Duarte is taking up here. Sometimes coming into midfield, then into the back line as Spain come forward. And Gavi has it on the right-hand side. Here is Ferran Torres, whips the ball across. It's cleared away at the back by Fulop and out for a Spain throw. You know what they've done is they have put five at the back, but one of them is going into midfield, whoever it may be. And they continue, they're swapping and changing to go into the midfield. And Spain haven't worked it out yet, but all they need to do is one of them pull out, one of them make the running behind where the space is and they'll be in. It's strengthened numbers by Costa Rica, but it still can leave space in behind them. Ball into the penalty area, will be cleared away by Oviedo. He's under pressure though, went under that pressure, runs it straight out for the corner and that's well played by Pedri. It's a mistake from the experienced Brian Oviedo. And it's a corner to Spain. Yeah, we saw from one of the goals in the first star from the penalty, it's given away by just the relentless pressure and that's just as confident as they have from the back line. The likes of Rodri just stood there going to go boys, go press. I got to take care of this corner played short by Spain. They work it out to this right hand side and Danny Olmo with a since CEO tries the one to well, we'll find it down by the bar line pulls the ball across cleared away from inside the Costa Rican penalty area and out up towards halfway with Keisha Fuller, won't reach Joel Campbell though. And now it's opening up for Spain down this right hand side as Pili Quitter won't find Torres does find Pedri. Olmo runs into Calvo and Spain have it back with Jordi Albert as Costa Rica gets into their back line. They have Navas in goal the back for now slightly shuffle so Fuller's gone over to right back. Duarte at the moment is dropped into that centre half position as Duarte makes the interception. Their Calvo and over Yado make up the current back line, although Waston who's come in is now dropping back into that back five as well. So they are switching on because Duarte is sometimes stepping up into the midfield to make it a four and now it's Waston stepping up from that back three to make it a four. It's pressure that is being employed by those two centre hearts of Costa Rica, Duarte and Waston ahead of them. You have to Yada and Borges in the midfield over on the far side now is Contreras. Duarte is in Bennett over on this left hand side and Joel Campbell has gone up through the centre. It's interesting tactic, interesting employee from Costa Rica. Gavi coming down the right hand side for Spain, lovely control by Ferran Torres. He then ran into Calvo, still has it Ferran Torres slides it underneath Navas. He has his second of the game, Spain have their fourth and Costa Rica are falling apart here. Spain four Costa Rican ill. It's just so so easy combination of passes. Ferran Torres gets it wrong initially in the first tackle, gets blocked and then the Costa Rican defences, all just stand and watch, allow him to pick the ball up again and then it's just too late. It's got enough of the goal to hit, Cale Navas can't get back, it's a mess. The problem with strength in numbers is it's too many cooks. You've got to, one of you's got to take control of the situation. They're trying to go man to man but the movement of Spain is such that they don't know who's going to go for the man that's in space. Therefore, it's a bit after you, they're all just waiting, all just backing off and slots it home for six yards unchallenged. Unfortunately for them, it's more of the same. More of the same for Spain that will certainly make them smart but as Rob says, more of the same for Costa Rica as well. Costa Rica it is, who get us underway, Ferran Torres with his seconds of the game, Spain have fourth and they are not, we can say with confidence, going to go the way of Argentina, they are not going to go the way of Germany in their opening match at this World Cup. Alvaro Morata is stripped and ready to come on and there's a guy who thrives on confidence and thrives on goals and he's got a good 35 minutes to add some bags and goals here and get his confidence going and get himself into the tournament. Changes are being rung, he's not on his own. Yeah and why not from Luis Enrique's point of view, four-nil, Spain lead Costa Rica and we still, as Rob says, have 35 minutes to play here on Five Live and BBC Sound. Belgium against Canada coming up at seven o'clock but Spain aren't done here, Dani Elmo wants to inside the penalty area twisting one way then the other. Ball will come across to Ferran Torres, Oviedo got there with the header, is behind for a Spain corner. We're here at the point now where as a professional he's saying, Costa Rica he's saying, right, professional pride, we don't want to lose by more than five, we don't want to lose by more than six, let's just keep it down because it just hurts from now on in. It's just a number that's going to look really, really bad. So here is the first change and Ferran Torres will not be getting a hat trick. He is coming off and Morata is coming on. Pedri another of those being replaced. And he will make way for Carlos Soller. So a chance for Morata to come on and perhaps make an immediate impact from this corner as it's whipped in by Sencio, cleared away by Navas, comes out to Jordi Alba, out to the left hand side and Roger will lift it in and it's cleared away by Waston for another Spain corner. You have to see the shape of Spain because it's just been one corner leapt to another and I'd imagine Morata to go up front and Sencio to come out onto this right hand side. The problems don't change for Costa Rica. What you would say is that Pedri and Torres have proved their point for the game, proved how important they are to the team and can rest up and get ready for the next one. Yeah, very much so. Spain, Dani Almo and Asintio between them decide to take the corner short and Costa Rica only had one player there defending. It was Jivis and Bennett, but they do manage to marshal Spain back towards the halfway line and then a missed control from Asintio. We'll give Bennett and Costa Rica a throw, Spain for Costa Rica nil. Not criticising them too often in this game, Spain, but that was a bit schoolboy-ish because they played the short corner and then realised that they were offside because no one was on the line for Costa Rica. Well, that's it, isn't it? It was a two on one if they got it right, but they didn't. They're in lies of the detail. Indeed. So, Spain in position just outside their own penalty area. We have already had another almighty shock at the World Cup today. You're just joining us. Japan coming from behind to beat Germany by two goals to one. Morocco nil nil with Croatia ahead of that and Belgium against Canada to come on five live and BBC sounds. 13 and a half minutes gone in this second half. Spain for Costa Rica nil and United Seaman. Again, just employing that tactic that we touched on earlier in the first half. It's something that Luis Enrique likes the entire team to do very explicitly. He said he wants Seaman to do it as well. Just draw the opponents in, although Seaman well decides to go safety first up to the halfway line there. But that's the approach, isn't it? If there's an opponent closing me down, yes, as a goalkeeper, it looks risky. But if everybody does their jobs, it leaves somebody else unmarked. You will always have a pass. The other team have a goalkeeper and the other the other the opposition's goalkeeper will not be pressing. He won't be marking. So you are the spare man. And if you can do it and you get it right and you back yourself to do it, then it works. Spain in position just outside the very penalty area. Here is Busquets spreads the play out to Azpilicueta Costa Rica. Preparing a double change as well as a sentier plays it forward. A peel of offside against Marathe. Flag stays down for now. Marathe right hand side of the penalty area tries to pull the ball across. Waston gets it in a little back here by Olmo to keep it in as Waston blocked it away. And it's cleared away eventually by Costa Rica. Lovely improvisation by Danny Almau and the flag hasn't gone up yet. So that might well have been onside for Marathe. Although of course, VAR would have had a look at it should have come to anything but lovely skill from Olmo. Yeah, great improvisation and I think you timed that really well of our Marathe. Just I think it's your second guess himself. He was going through and the ball was in there to play to slide it across the goal. He just didn't take the opportunity. Maybe 10 minutes time a little bit sharper he would have done. So Spain with the ball just outside their own penalty area. Spain who are heading for just their third victory in their last eight World Cup games after winning the 2010 edition, the first in their history and they're coming forward again. Gavi goes down and will win a free kick just inside the Costa Rica off. If he doesn't get booked here, that was almost just a slap on the side of the head from Calvo. He had one challenge in the first half that should have been a booking. That he was beaten and he was away there and Gavi was gone. He should be off. But he's not. He is reprieved and Costa Rica will make a double change. Alvaro Zamora, one of their youngsters in the squad just 20 years of age, never actually played in the qualifiers, comes on at his first World Cup. And a special moment for Brian Ruiz as well as Olmo drives from distance over the bar for Spain. The former fuller man, Costa Rican legends will retire after this World Cup becomes the oldest Costa Rican player at a World Cup. He's off the bench 37 years of age, he's signed a trailing by Fort Goldsternil. But what a servant he has been to this Costa Rican national side. England's Nemesis, one of those World Cups. Indeed. The manager was not best pleased with him. It's former fuller manager, Oli Hodson. 37 with 29 minutes to go. Impact player. One plan. Go on and change the game for us. Easy peasy, four nil time to Spain. See what you can do. But we have seen a bit of playing without pressure at times from Costa Rican, particularly after the third goal went in and that's all they can do, isn't it? Like you said, Rob Green at that point, just go out, just learn from it. Try to keep it now to four. Yeah, I think you're looking at playing against some of the great European players in this side and players of masters of finding space and how to solve problems on the pitch and using your intuition and your understanding of football. They're always thinking, they're always understanding ways to change the game. And they're coming forward now. Maratta inside the penalty area, took the shot early past that near post, which Navas had covered. Yeah, it was a good run, a good ball. And to Chelsea, former Chelsea teammate of our Maratta from Aspelicueta, the angle was never there, probably, but I don't think he really knew where his teammates were. It wasn't really anyone up in support, so took the shot on, was never on. So a double change being made for Spain. Busquets, one of the players coming off as is Jordi Alba and Armulcom Coque and what a moment this is, the Alejandro Balde. He was a late call-up after Jose Gaia, who had been named in the squad, injured his ankle in training. He makes his Spain debut at a World Cup. It was his first senior call-up. He's impressed for Barcelona this season, the youngster, but yes, they're falling it up. Yes, this game is won. But that is still a choice from Luis Enrique to say, look, you know, three days ago, you didn't even think you'd be here. You didn't imagine you'd be here, but then a late injury and you get your opportunity in a match we've already won. But this is what I'm going to do. And it's just typical, isn't it, of how he manages the young players at his disposal. Well, as Gaia was saying before the game, it's more of a club mentality and we're going to bed people for the future and put people in for the future. And he is one for the future. He is a talent. And I'll tell you what, Costa Rica having a look, they've been up against Alba all that time, who was fantastic for the time that he was on. They won't be grateful for Balde coming on because he's sharp, he's direct, he's quick. He wants to get forward, he wants to run at people. You've got tiring legs and tiring minds. You don't need that. Yep, just 19 years of age as Azpila Quitter has it just outside his own penalty area, turning away from the former Everton and Sondland man, Bruno Viedo, and winning the throw as well. But yes, as you say, real breakthrough season at club level, starting regularly for Barcelona and on for a taste of World Cup action on his Spain debut. Huge moment for the teenager in Spain, leading by four goals to nearly 20 minutes played in the second half, here on Five Live. And BBC Sounds, a reminder, you can listen to all the latest debates and analysis and reaction from the World Cup on the World Cup Daily podcast. Just download that from BBC Sounds every day all throughout the tournament. And here goes Balde, racing down the left-hand side, lasered off to Danielmo, went for the 1-2, Balde looked as though he didn't quite get there in the flag, in the end does go up, just didn't keep that in there. But tell you what, he's not come on to set off a 4-0 or shore up the defence. He's bombing down that left-hand side as he likes to do the young left back. And I think we might see a bit more of him in this game. Yep, he's quick, but he's not as quick as his mate Danielmo. I thought he was because that was a fair old pass for him to chase and he nearly got there. 21 minutes played, Spain for Costa Rica Neal as Costa Rica played out from the back. They've been so dominant in this match. What does this tell us? How much does this tell us about how Spain are going to do at this tournament? You attempted to say not a lot, really. I mean, the strength of the opposition and they really just haven't made it difficult. You're thinking, yes, technically we were not as good as Spain went to organise. We can get organised, we can make it difficult, they just haven't. They've made it a walk in the park for them. And realistically, you look at the subs they're making, the blooding youngsters, they're resting old legs, they just know the game's up. Spain know that they've won the game, they've won it since 15 minutes in. There's been a cruise for them, much like England in their game, really. How do you assess against such opposition? Spain in possession, winning that free kick for offside and Gavi will play it back in fields to Coque. Spain have it once more. What are you looking for if you're Luis Enrique then for the final half of this half? I think you're looking, well, he's looking for more understanding from his players of how to play in the shape that they want to play because they won't have had much build-up like the rest of the team and it really is a good exercise for them this last half hour. Here goes Gavi outside the penalty area, just overran it, it was well read by Calvo. And the ball is cleared away by Costa Rica. Oh, that's a terrible challenge, go sliding in there. Oh, Calvo, yellow card. Well, he's playing on the edge. We've said that all match, Rob Green. He's got a yellow there, it was out very quickly. But my word, that wasn't a good challenge at all. It was a strong yellow, a strong, strong yellow and orange almost. And it's what could have been off a couple of times here. Studs are up, does get a touch on the ball, but it's dangerous, it's reckless. And in the modern game, it's fractions away from a really serious, serious injury. I think what saves him there is he does pull his leg back slightly and his feet are on the ground, but both feet are going at some pace as Spain make their final changes. Sinccio is coming off and Nico Williams, not that one, Spains. Nico Williams is coming on. Another aside in talent, Sinccio showing it in flashes today, much like his game time in this club. It does moments of brilliance, moments where he frustrates you. Again, another youngster coming on. It's just a wonderful opportunity, not just a wonderful opportunity for them, but really important just to get themselves into a well cut. You don't know when you're going to be needed, it could be a couple of weeks time and you're not kicked to ball in the game. Here goes Dani Olmo down the left-hand side for Spain. Plays it back to Balde, young left back and now Coké. Substitutes combining as Spain whip it out to this right-hand side and the spila quiet and nicely controlled, plays the ball into the area. The header across goal is patted down expertly by Navas from Olmo with Marathe Lerking. There's two players in the box, four Costa Rica players in the box. They're not marking either of them. You've got one job, you're defending the goal, defend, mark the men. Zonal marking? It didn't work. It wasn't really doing that either, was it? They weren't in the zone. They're in the wrong zone indeed. Spain in possession on the halfway line, here is Gavi, will send it back to Rodri, who taps it away from Brian Ruiz. One player who could really do with the goal out there, Alvaro Malata. Yep, lives off the confidence of the goals. He's played before, he spoke to Giam, other tournaments about him, and having played with him at Chelsea, you just want to give him a hug. You want him to do so well, he's such a nice guy, and you just feel like he just needs things to fall in place for him at times. A goal, anything in this game, just giving that little push in the right direction for him. Rob Green with us here on 5 Live in BBC Sounds, 25 minutes played in the second half, Spain leading Costa Rica by 4 goals to Niel, and us, Fila Quetta, has it on the halfway line. Yes, 5 goals he has scored for Atletico Madrid this season, Alvaro Malata. He was actually the top scorer of Spain at the Euros, but he's a player that comes in for so much stick. Luis Enrique, I remember constantly having to defend him through the Euros. Yes, he misses some pretty big chances that he really should put away, but Luis Enrique pointing to his overall record for Spain in terms of numbers. But it's the key ones, at key moments, that people remember, isn't it? Yes, it's about one in two, and I think the worst thing that happened to him was that he was the player to replace Diego Costa at Chelsea, and he's just not, not many people are Diego Costa, and it was the direct comparisons there that really hit home, and it wasn't something that, that's not his game. So why compare him? Costa Rica preparing to make another change, and they are resting, I'm going to call them older legs rather than old legs, off-screen, the older legs of Salso Borges, their most capped player. He is making weight, and Brandon Aguilera will come on. And again for Costa Rica, I mean, as you said, to be honest, after half an hour, they knew the game's gone, but Borges is an important player still, if they want to try and keep some momentum in the game. You know the game's gone at that point, but you can't make a raft of changes then, because four meals are hammering, it can be worse. Yep, you're looking at the next games that they've got, you're looking at games with a quick turnaround, you can very little that you can change, and in the next coming games, Japan, buoyed by that win, Germany will be desperately keen to bounce back from the defeat. So they've got it all to do if they're even going to register in this tournament, because this evidence, a very, very compelling evidence that they're not going to. Trailing by four goals to nil, and it's Spain coming forward once more here, it's Gavi suddenly the acceleration through the gears, well intercepted in the centre, and cleared away by Keisha Fuller, good driving run over the halfway line out to the right-hand side, back to Fuller once more, he's rounded by Redshirts trying to trick his way past, but he can't do so, and it's forward to Morata, and Olmo is often away to his left, just about keeps it in on that left-hand touchline. The Redshirts, just two of them arriving now into the area, it was left for Morata, because Nico Williams knew he'd straight offside and easy for Navas to gather. Oh, there's the Mexican wave, there it is, you can hear it going around, listeners, it's got to say it's not going around with the same energy that it did in the first half. Not the same amount of people either. Now, Kikosterika, fashion a chance here, Joel Campbell into the penalty area, flag stays down, eventually goes up, saved by the backheel in the end of I see Mamba, the flag had already gone up. That's one of those where either put it up straight away or allow the move to play out. What's the point of letting Joel Campbell run 15 more yards into the penalty area and then stopping it? Well, he does receive the ball, therefore makes him offside, but there wasn't a point where he was onside again. It's so obvious that he's going to get to the ball first because he was yards offside, that's why he's getting there first, and you still have to wait. Spain looked to pick up the ball on the left-hand side and he managed to do so with Baldey, and off he goes again using that turn at pace, the boss learning, oh, what a run, this is slided into Barata, flag stays down, Navas, good touch on it, forces the ball, Amarata out of the penalty area, ball back in, Gabi, oh, brilliant goal, what a fantastic goal, edge of the box, first time in of the post, Spain have five, and Gabi becomes their youngest goal scorer at a World Cup. Spain five, Costa Rica nil. It's a wonderful finish outside of the boot, edge of the box, in of the post, it's not as good as the run from Baldey to build up to it, he ran past four, five, Costa Rican players, the only question does Marata stray offside, maybe his left toe, maybe his fraction of his left foot, there's nothing to take away from it, because the vision from Marata then to find Gabi is equal to, and more from the finish, it's a wonderful finish, just a cleverness of how to do it, I'm going to lend it with the outside of the foot, fade it into that far corner, it's going to go to the semi-automated machine to be checked, everyone's back ready to start again. It is one of those where when it was played, I thought maybe Marata was offside, I wonder if they would almost count it as a second phase, because Navas makes the initial save, but it's one of those that again Costa Rica will feel, well if that was offside, just put your flag up. No, I don't think it was, it was tight, but it was onside, down to fractions of inches of people's body parts, and evidently it's another to the tally and assist from Marata, he'll be looking for that goal now. So 15 minutes to go, Spain 5-0, lead Costa Rica, and as we hit that final 15 minutes, 842 passes for Spain, 159 for Costa Rica. Well Costa Rica will say, there's been over a thousand passes in the game and we've been a part of that. Always taking the positives, Rob Green here on 5-Live in BBC Sounds, but it's been impressive from Spain as Rob says, difficult to know how much stort is set by this, but it's the old adage isn't it, you can only beat what's in front of you, and they've been very good today as they have it over on that left hand side as the Mexican wave goes round again, just going through the Spain fans over there with the red and yellow flags, Rodri in possession, full Spain in the centre circle. I'm just pleased you didn't question my maths, sir. Oh now you got me thinking. No, you're right, you're right, I think over a thousand it is. Spain lose possession just inside the Costa Rica half as the attendance is announced, just over 40,000. We have been talking about the capacities in this World Cup, it's one of these, the official capacities are actually given a slightly smaller for various reasons, FIFA reserve a few seats for the media and others, so the actual capacities, if you've noticed this trend, they're actually higher than the official ones, we have been assured that that's realistically because there are more seats in the stadium, so just over 40,000 here, but we have to say in terms of the number of seats filled, at no point does it really look as though it has been near to what will be slightly over 40,000 real life capacity. I'm not calling anyone out or saying anyone's a liar, but I would say this was about three quarters full from the start and hasn't filled up to capacity anywhere near. Costa Rica with the free kick just outside the centre circle, trailing Spain by five goals to nil. We were talking about Gavi before the match, Rob became their youngest World Cup debutant when he started this game and now becomes their youngest World Cup goal scorer as well at the tender age of 18. Thoughts on him in a moment as Costa Rica swing the ball into the area and the foul goes against Costa Rica on. They're not too happy with this, and why did he to thepel Station? Well, Costa neuron d aldin attitude a w a the game. I mean, I'm not sure if he's got it wrong. And kind of sums up their evening. Slightly comical moment with Austin, who's. Sizeable guy Gabby, who's probably about a third of his size, taking exception to whatever he does and he has to say it's probably the first mismatch of the game that's actually been in Costa Rica's favor. So the referee is going to have to take action. And then that's going to be the last game in the world to see how Austin and no further punishment. And Austin will now repeat that jog back up to the halfway line. And Spain will have a free kick inside their penalty area, so yeah, going back to Gabby who was involved in a bit of afters there, but what have you made of his world cup debut so far? It's been very impressive. He's played alongside his two players, and he's been playing with the ball. He's had time on the ball. He's been allowed to do what he wants to do really with the ball and you know, it looks like. Here comes spain. Nico Williams with the ball in that's an excellent covering challenge by fuller because they would have been a tapping at the far post for Alvaro Marata. It remains just the five to Spain. Yeah, legs have gone now for Costa Rica. It was just weather fuller could get back again. It was an open game. He's had a good time. He's got a lot of time to play. He's been playing in the Champions League. I've. Seen for Barcelona a number of times live and he's very, very good against the teams which answer good. He comes up against the really good side in the Champions League is his has been the question. Yes he's young. Yes, he's got time to improve. But he's in a world cup. He's been playing in the Champions League. He's also for the Champions League. He's got time to play. He's got time to play. He's got time to play. He is Gaby, the 18 year old. The records do just keep tumbling. But as Rob says, he will face stiffer tests. Certainly will do him the world of good to get this game, this performance and the goal under his belt in this opening match of the World Cup Spain five Costa Rica. Nail nine minutes plus that of time to play here on five live and be busy sounds as the ball is through the net. But Navas did well there. Yep stood up on the angle knew that it sort of suited him. He was offside and very, very tight again. His touch wasn't great from Marasa took him wide and Navas knew that just waited for it to make the save. Final change for Costa Rica arrest for Brian of the Ado and the final game. And the final game is over. Ronald Matarita is on. And Costa Rica now have just over nine minutes plus out of time to try and stop this getting any worse as those people are quite a comes forward to war of frustration for the Chelsea captain just handled the ball as he came forward and it's a free kick to Costa Rica. Playing out now and it's taking two passes for them to almost lose the ball and thinking with eight and a half nine minutes to go, he just get it as far away from your own goal as possible. Really forwards goes out for a Costa Rican throw. Matarita just on will take it the side to trial by five goals to nil and as Navas please the ball over halfway head of one by Rodry. How would you assess his performance at center half? It's been it's been an absolute cruise. Now as once he has to stretch his legs once he had to do something that you thought was above and beyond and that's been it. I think there's been a number of cases for Luis Enrique where people have enhanced their causes and that's been one for him to center half. He has done it before. Maybe a bit of an experiment. There are center halves in this Spain side. You're looking at Paltores in particular. Very good center half for Villareal, but he's been chosen. Eric Garcia one for Barcelona, not chosen again. So there's a lot of players in hearts that causes here. Baldi looking to do just that on for this cameo at the ends of the match out on the left hand side of Spain working out to as Pila Quetta on the right hand side has Williams ahead of him goes in field instead to cocaine who's. Working his way around that center circle and now out to the left hand side goes the port exchanges passes with Danny Olmo and back in field and again Spain just very patiently playing this around looking to play it now over the top looking for Nico Williams, but too much on it and it's behind for Costa Rica Golcic. He looking around saying there's 40,000 here and you know you're right me down to about 10 now 12,000 of hardy souls sticking out before the end of the game. It's been done and dusted for a long time and really unfortunate for Costa Rica fans who've made the journey. Spent a lot of money coming. It's one that they knew they were up against it from the get go. Soon as this group was drawn and very little in this game to say that it's going to be anything but difficult. Costa Rica have it just outside the main penalty area. Nico Williams gets a foot in and will retain position eventually for Spain, but plays it straight into Brian Ruiz and Costa Rica should be able to clear away. They navigated such a difficult group in 2014 Costa Rica, but very different proposition now after being hammered in their first game in 2014. They beat Italy, they beat Uruguay, they drew of course with England under Roy Hodgson and it was that positive start that meant that they were able to progress through as they did all the way to the quarterfinals, but as they have it back inside their own penalty area with Navas. We talk about Spain, I mean, yes, Costa Rica have just been a class below them, but again we think Germany who lost today to Japan, we think Argentina who lost today to Saudi Arabia. Spain have come out like France did, like England did, got the job done and it's only the third time in their history they've scored five or more goals in a World Cup match. They did it in 86 against Denmark, they did it in 98 against Bulgaria and in fact if they get one more goal it'll be their biggest winning margin of victory at a World Cup as well, so it is important potentially in a tournament where we're seeing the likes of Germany and Argentina stutter that Spain do put down a bit of a marker as well as doing the first job of navigating this match as they have it on the halfway line. And it's been such a cruise, it's been a training game in many risks, so the training session that you say a good exercise, but also next game coming up Germany, then Japan, the games are coming thick and fast, after that you say because it's been such a cruise, because they've not had to play 100% for over an hour really. Coming down the left hand side once again Daniilma picks it up inside the penalty area, chips the ball across, headed away by Waston for Costa Rica helped on by Aguilera and Costa Rica will win a free kick as well, midway inside their own half, not had too much chance to see much of Brandon Aguilera, the 19 year old since coming on, he's currently on loan at Guana and he's from Nottingham Forest, he's seen by many in Costa Rica as the natural successor to Brian Ruiz which is always one of those you don't want to quite put on a young player, but he will hope that he has chances with Costa Rica at this tournament, to just show a little bit of why people in his home country feel that he could be one of the next best things as Nico Williams comes forward for Spain, well covered by Waston, but only out of play for a Spain throw into the final plus added time, Spain 5 Costa Rica nil It's been a subdued atmosphere in the ground really, almost from the get go, people realised just how quick, how good that Spain have been how much they sort of just sat back and enjoyed it really, it's been a constant performance from them, a very comfortable performance from them and I'll take great heart from this and as I was saying the fact that they'll walk off the pitch and go that's not so bad, I've had a bit of a freshener, I've had a bit of a live no we've not had a game for 10 days, well we're back together again, we know how we feel we know how we feel, we've got a shape we found a team, we've got a lot of ticks in the boxes, Luis Enrique will be pleased they'll be happy there's not else much you could say Here is Sanioomo 25 yards out, slide it through, this would round it off if there was a goal for Alvaro Marata but in the end it's all the way through to Navas I think that's the one I think if he said what would make it ideal, it was one goal for Alvaro Marata just to get him off and running because he's the out and out centre forward really anyone if you said give us a number nine for Spain Asensio played there today, he can play there and he has played there for Real Madrid but he's not a focal point he's not a number nine on today's performance might not need one Well that's it isn't it as you say Marata the only out and out striker in the squad but the false nine, the fluidity and it's what those yes it's a false nine but when they play there so regularly and they almost take on the attributes of a centre forward as well it just gives Spain so many options and as we've touched on as well they've got the options in defence as well so that is the story we're looking at this tournament I'm not sure we can confidently predict what ending the story will have but this is a Spain side who are young, they're exciting they've played very well today they will face bigger tests and the next one is the biggest you would think they'll face in the group although maybe shouldn't say that given that Japan are beaten Germany but they are up against Germany a Germany side who know that that game for them now having lost to Japan today is absolutely huge as the ball is into the area from Nico Williams, Navas makes the save the follow up is knitted by Carlos Soler and Spain do have their sixth goal, it's their biggest winning margin at a World Cup in their history they have swept Costa Rica away six nil they leave again so so simple but the quality is there Nico Williams on the right hand side gets the ball wide out on the touch line that's where damage has been caused today very very wide stretching the game wide takes his man on Navas has to step in has to do something Marat has there waiting but all he can do is outstretch Dom lays it on a plate for Soler really sitly, it's been a walk in the park for Spain Elcon dust themselves down and they are not grateful for this news the news for Costa Rica is that there's eight minutes of added time blow the whistle poor Costa Rica blow the whistle referee but you touched on it earlier Rob it is enjoyment from this stadium they've enjoyed this spectacle this show that Spain have put on and yes it's not been a contest we've known that from 30 minutes but it's been very very good to watch from Spain it's been a fantastic performance by them it's just the shame that everyone stayed to see it all can Costa Rica get a consolation can they stop it being Spain's biggest winning margin at a World Cup, Joel Campbell swings the ball in and you know I see more I make that probably the hardest thing he's had to do all game take that cross and he did it well it's the first time he's had to intervene in the game other than receiving back passes which is not an intervention you're just receiving the ball from your teammate and folding on the ball that's actually something where he's had to stop the opposition doing anything and again kind of just sums it all up doesn't it Spain you sense might not be done yet they've got seven further minutes of added time to try and get a seventh goal against Costa Rica here on Five Live and BBC Sounds and as you say Rob mentioned a few minutes earlier Costa Rica really struggling now in terms of legs Duarte's just slid in there and didn't get anywhere near the ball didn't get near the player in the end either but it's that far off yeah he's that far off Spain coming down the right hand side here is Gavi he's become their youngest scorer at a World Cup in their history the record continue to tumble for him now Nico Williams Marata can the number seven get the seventh yes he can seventh heaven for Spain and for Marata and that is the cherry on top of the cake that they wanted Alvaro Marata such a confidence player gets his goal and what a confidence start this is to this World Cup from Spain 7-0 they are thrashing Costa Rica the last box is ticked for Luis Enrique and that was the biggest celebration of the lot by the gold scorer he was thrilled and it's a really really good goal one touch two touch football on the edge of the box yes there's limited opposition yes it's around Manikins it's been like that for over an hour and a half now and it's saying it's a really really good finish a tidy finish in the bottom corner with his weaker foot feels it in the corner you don't have to smash them in just bend it in that far corner and you same when that 8 minutes injury time went up it just felt like it was a final body blow for Costa Rica and they they're on the floor they're done although we've just seen a brilliant piece of skill from the centre half Francisco Calvo lovely little turn as the ball is chipped into the area by Brian Ruiz but Seymourn is right underneath it well 8 minutes have added time why'd it end up being 8-0 you wouldn't bet against it we've still got 5 to play there's no opposition now it's a case of picking your passes and picking the right pass finding the space because Costa Rica have stopped running they've stopped moving and it's just a shame that it's ended in such a way in such a you don't want to use the word humiliation but it is a humiliating defeat Gavi goes down, wins a free kick off Aguilera Spain get things moving quickly again Belgium against Canada to come, 7 o'clock here on 5 Live and BBC Sands with John Murray and Dion Dublin that's after Japan's shock win over Germany earlier today Morocco nil nil against Croatia the other score and we have seen Spain put 7 past Costa Rica tomorrow on 5 Live and BBC Sands, 4 games for you for a day at this World Cup in the group stages including one of the favourites Brazil Rick Edwards will have all the build up on 5 Live breakfast from 6am Costa Rica clear the ball away headed forward by Rodry brought down by his pinaqueta just inside the centre circle trapped by Gavi and out to the right hand side and Nico Williams plays the ball back to Gavi once more as Costa Rica to be fair to them particularly the substitutes they're trying to close down they're trying to stop the spaces and the gaps opening up but as you say Rob humiliation is the word for it 7 nil they trail I'm just waiting for you to ask me have you ever lost 7 nil have you ever lost 7 nil Robry 6 lots of times never 7 there you go Spain in possession with Danny Olmote out to the left hand side as they build once more here is Baldey back to Olmote the stands emptying around us with the fans who are enjoying still Spain playing some lovely stuff as Gavi goes in the ball is laid off and the miss cue on the edge of the area from Carlos Soleil he's already got one he could have had two Spain could have had eight but it stays at seven yep they've had the chances looking now over 15 shots in the game been clinical Daniel Navas has barely made a save from the shots on target producer Gary just pointing out over a thousand passes completed in the game from Spain that is just pretty much a death by a thousand cuts a death by a thousand passes and by seven goals as well Spain in possession we have two minutes of other times of play until Costa Rica are put out of their misery but Spain are not letting up still they're dancing the edge of the penalty area Marata lays it off to Olmo but they've won a free kick right on the edge of the box Spain ball they're going down it'll be a yellow card as well and I don't know how much worse it can get well I do it can get eight-nil worse for Costa Rica but they just want to get off the pitch now what you would say is on consolation or one of the few consolations in the side is a Calvo he's done very well not to get sent off in the game because that could have been made it really bad Joel Campbell who's gone into the book there but yes Calvo the other Costa Rica player booked in Spain with Carlos Soler preparing to take this free kick from the left hand side and you have three red shirts in the penalty area can you have so many dotted around they could just play it in that arc couldn't they and almost work it to the penalty spot let's see what they do four red shirts now into the penalty area Spain prepare to whip this free kick in and the referee they do keep doing this that they're so hot on conversations even really in the penalty area they don't want to see any any pushing and shoving the referees so just making sure that that is not occurring and now Spain will be able to take this free kick from the left hand side it's whipped in it's cleared away by Costa Rica it's out for Spain throw well that was a wasteful opportunity there but it's about it really for criticisms for Spain one poor pass in there in over a thousand it's not that bad in possession on the halfway line and Spain and Luis Enrique's thoughts will turn very shortly to Germany on Sunday then Japan next Thursday Costa Rica well you never say that a World Cup is already over after the first game but it's been a humiliation for the Costa Ricans it has been simply sublime from Spain 7-0 winners and Rob Green you couldn't have asked for a more perfect performance it's absolutely what they wanted it's what they needed coming into this tournament out of few questions young players coming in can they find a way to play can they come up with answers well it's been a perfect training session for them because that's pretty much what it's been it's not been a contest it's been a training session for them a warm up for bigger games to come and if you're getting over a thousand passes in a game then that's an incredible achievement and to win any is a brilliant achievement they really have been brilliant in this game and bit of history as well for Spain their biggest World Cup win in their history Gavi becoming their youngest World Cup goal scorer Alvaro Barata getting his goal as well to round off the 7 I can tell you Kelly that Guillain Ballagay has a very big smile on his face because it's finished Spain 7 Costa Rican 7 up for Spain and they were absolutely sparkling against Costa Rica the trick Guillain is going to be keeping Spanish feet on the ground ahead of the next two group stage matches nah forget it embrace it this is what we want Guillain yes for 80 yeah for 89 minutes you've been saying oh wow but all I heard was Rob saying oh too many passes on the training session the same put the feet down no no 7-0 to one of the last 10 tournaments we only won twice in the last 10 tournaments the first game of the tournament so this was unbelievable the first half stop the tournament now finish it now it's coming home to last",
