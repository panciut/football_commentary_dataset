[0.00 - 4.16] P:1906.51 E:0.033486 |  In the top six tiers in England who are yet to score this season,
[4.16 - 5.60] P:1881.66 E:0.071102 |  as we're under way,
[5.60 - 8.24] P:1710.94 E:0.095417 |  and Aston Villa playing from left to right as we look.
[8.24 - 14.32] P:1929.71 E:0.055300 |  Martinez in a lemon yellow, short sleeve shirts.
[14.32 - 16.40] P:1788.14 E:0.088762 |  Are you surprised he's been brought back in
[16.40 - 18.16] P:1822.97 E:0.088774 |  after obviously he was instigating a move
[18.16 - 19.52] P:1699.53 E:0.086929 |  or looking to get away from the club?
[19.52 - 22.32] P:1675.28 E:0.096341 |  No, not at all. He's one of the best goalkeepers in world football.
[22.32 - 25.84] P:1761.13 E:0.083835 |  I think there was an element of the move was getting forced upon him
[25.84 - 27.84] P:1745.30 E:0.086978 |  because of the money that he's actually on
[27.92 - 29.92] P:1830.06 E:0.090355 |  and he wants him to shift wages.
[29.92 - 31.60] P:1790.46 E:0.079985 |  But he's a fantastic goalkeeper
[31.60 - 34.40] P:1649.35 E:0.094658 |  and the back line will be delighted that he's back in goal.
[35.20 - 38.16] P:1789.61 E:0.109773 |  Stephen Warlock is with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[38.16 - 40.64] P:1544.96 E:0.083044 |  We're also available on the BBC Sounds app.
[40.64 - 42.72] P:1804.37 E:0.102559 |  More choices to listen than ever before.
[42.72 - 45.52] P:1692.15 E:0.089468 |  And you think that this weekend we've got the world athletics,
[45.52 - 48.48] P:1663.38 E:0.073515 |  the boxing, the golf, the horse racing, the cricket,
[48.48 - 50.88] P:1662.49 E:0.098266 |  Premier League football, the women's World Cup, rugby union.
[51.76 - 54.00] P:1823.29 E:0.093038 |  And no wonder that Sports Extra and Stream,
[54.00 - 57.60] P:1852.49 E:0.089748 |  Sports Extra 2 and 3 will give you a choice of listening.
[57.60 - 58.64] P:1738.48 E:0.101926 |  If you don't want the football.
[58.64 - 60.96] P:1837.19 E:0.102291 |  But this is the usual goal service in Aston Villa.
[62.16 - 64.72] P:1790.55 E:0.095912 |  Caught in possession in midfield, McGinn,
[64.72 - 67.04] P:1790.13 E:0.088374 |  and Grealish against his former club.
[67.76 - 71.52] P:1815.01 E:0.094973 |  Picked up a few goons there from the Aston Villa travelling support.
[71.52 - 74.24] P:1690.09 E:0.075934 |  I think there are still a few late arrivals, aren't they?
[74.24 - 78.08] P:1701.24 E:0.089423 |  What was it? A horse on the rail tracks at nearby Formby.
[78.08 - 80.64] P:1699.63 E:0.098566 |  Yeah, something like that. But everyone seems to be in.
[80.64 - 82.16] P:1723.00 E:0.065436 |  It seems packed, doesn't it?
[82.16 - 84.72] P:1747.34 E:0.095643 |  I mean, I was quite surprised how many empty seats
[84.72 - 86.72] P:1617.70 E:0.094610 |  there were. It was about five minutes to go
[86.80 - 89.04] P:1600.15 E:0.085532 |  before kickoff, but now seems like everyone's in.
[89.60 - 95.36] P:1769.02 E:0.086336 |  52,769 is the capacity here for the Hill Dickinson Stadium
[95.36 - 97.52] P:1658.98 E:0.091073 |  on Bramley Mordok in Liverpool.
[97.52 - 101.52] P:1723.91 E:0.085201 |  This bold design as Beto looks to hold the ball up.
[101.52 - 102.88] P:1797.68 E:0.104594 |  Bit of a tussle there with Mings.
[102.88 - 105.52] P:1756.92 E:0.084368 |  Mings goes to ground and gets back to his feet quickly.
[106.48 - 107.92] P:1648.96 E:0.105152 |  Plays it forward as Buendia.
[108.88 - 111.12] P:1808.01 E:0.118103 |  And then there was a little bit of hesitation from Dynia,
[111.12 - 114.48] P:1757.47 E:0.111528 |  and that allowed N'Jai to nip him to the feet of Beto.
[114.56 - 116.56] P:1760.24 E:0.103696 |  And Jai is up with him on the right-hand side.
[116.56 - 118.72] P:1729.49 E:0.101014 |  Here is N'Jai, right corner of the area,
[118.72 - 121.28] P:1780.85 E:0.100727 |  enters the box, and Jai with a cross, Beto stubbed it.
[122.24 - 124.56] P:1830.85 E:0.111011 |  He had a real opportunity to hit it first time
[124.56 - 127.04] P:1760.80 E:0.099195 |  and gets a clean strike. That's going goalwards.
[127.84 - 129.60] P:1714.67 E:0.099046 |  But he didn't, and it's likely he might have stood,
[129.60 - 132.48] P:1723.35 E:0.108741 |  he's standing leg, he's gone behind for a goal kick.
[132.48 - 135.52] P:1672.89 E:0.098626 |  We're going to go racing. The Park Stakes at Doncaster. John Hunt.
[135.52 - 137.84] P:1714.40 E:0.117633 |  There are halfway here, a seven-furlong trip in.
[137.84 - 140.88] P:1667.66 E:0.089638 |  The Group 2 Park Stakes and the field taken along
[140.88 - 142.64] P:1584.18 E:0.083793 |  by frontrunner Queen Olt.
[142.64 - 144.80] P:1604.21 E:0.090202 |  He's out in front by two lengths.
[144.80 - 147.60] P:1651.31 E:0.090333 |  Room service struggling at the back end of the field.
[149.20 - 152.80] P:1629.31 E:0.104863 |  Queen Olt leader is chased by Marvell Man in the early stages.
[152.80 - 156.48] P:1633.29 E:0.095490 |  Audience is there on the outside, followed now by Kings Gamble
[156.48 - 160.64] P:1680.29 E:0.097283 |  in fourth place, in fifth, and pushed along is Zoom Zoom.
[160.64 - 163.28] P:1657.36 E:0.093933 |  And then comes the well-fansied Shadow of Light,
[163.28 - 165.60] P:1712.29 E:0.097128 |  but only sixth or seventh for the favourite,
[165.60 - 168.48] P:1714.78 E:0.099704 |  as now Marvell Man sweeps to the front.
[168.48 - 171.76] P:1706.34 E:0.096791 |  Furl under go. Marvell Man goes on by two lengths.
[171.84 - 173.60] P:1783.95 E:0.089674 |  Audience giving vain chase.
[173.60 - 175.60] P:1664.18 E:0.097564 |  So too Queen Olt is struggling on.
[175.60 - 177.04] P:1661.18 E:0.097808 |  Next to him is Kings Gamble,
[177.04 - 179.84] P:1718.73 E:0.094297 |  but this is the easiest winner of the day so far.
[179.84 - 182.40] P:1704.10 E:0.093788 |  Marvell Man roms to victory in the Park Stakes.
[182.40 - 185.20] P:1656.87 E:0.091261 |  For trainer Andrew Boulding, he's won by five lengths,
[185.20 - 188.72] P:1668.47 E:0.098235 |  and Boulding has both further and outside Attarians
[188.72 - 190.24] P:1852.60 E:0.091399 |  to come in the St. Ledger.
[191.12 - 193.92] P:1682.54 E:0.082178 |  Thank you, John, and we'll be back in good time for you.
[193.92 - 198.40] P:1810.92 E:0.079934 |  That race at Doncaster for the St. Ledger is due off at 340.
[198.40 - 200.24] P:1666.83 E:0.102974 |  You've not missed anything whilst we've been away,
[200.24 - 202.80] P:1787.46 E:0.089744 |  because Beto's effort, he did strike his standing leg
[202.80 - 204.48] P:1825.65 E:0.075659 |  and went behind for a goal kick.
[204.48 - 206.00] P:1675.02 E:0.101703 |  Tyro Mingz has gone down,
[206.00 - 209.28] P:1811.55 E:0.086252 |  and as soon as Tyro Mingz goes to ground with an injury,
[209.28 - 211.04] P:1601.35 E:0.078373 |  you think, I hope it's not his knees.
[211.04 - 214.08] P:1841.38 E:0.101275 |  Yeah, I was just trying to see whether it is his knee or his calf.
[214.08 - 216.80] P:1677.17 E:0.074275 |  It was obviously Illumin in Jai,
[216.80 - 218.40] P:1594.02 E:0.104467 |  did great down that right-hand side,
[218.40 - 220.48] P:1554.70 E:0.082256 |  and as he went down the right-hand side,
[220.48 - 222.56] P:1845.23 E:0.101443 |  he got in a 1v1 situation,
[222.56 - 225.60] P:1716.36 E:0.088124 |  but the actual injury occurred before that instance,
[225.60 - 228.88] P:1791.14 E:0.085595 |  and he's hobbling as he gets put in a 1v1 situation
[228.88 - 229.84] P:1533.64 E:0.095035 |  with Illumin in Jai.
[229.84 - 233.04] P:1676.77 E:0.086204 |  So this is a real concern for Aston Villa and for Tyro Mingz.
[233.04 - 234.80] P:1833.48 E:0.097084 |  Well, Tyro Mingz is back on his feet,
[234.80 - 237.60] P:1661.80 E:0.093466 |  but he is walking rather gingerly at the moment.
[237.60 - 239.92] P:1692.74 E:0.084154 |  We'll get an update from Bournemouth, Sir Hel Sahi.
[239.92 - 242.24] P:1838.54 E:0.074926 |  Bournemouth has played Bournemouth nil, Brighton nil,
[242.24 - 244.32] P:1869.46 E:0.086739 |  but a disruption to the Brighton 11.
[244.32 - 247.76] P:1840.59 E:0.081539 |  Jack Husslewood is off after twisting his right ankle
[247.76 - 249.52] P:1871.14 E:0.090641 |  in a challenge with Evan Nielsen.
[249.52 - 251.76] P:1869.32 E:0.084131 |  Yassin Ayari has replaced him.
[251.76 - 254.32] P:1773.19 E:0.074362 |  Bournemouth nil, Brighton nil.
[254.32 - 257.20] P:1739.99 E:0.084554 |  Aston Villa are down to 10 temporarily.
[257.20 - 260.00] P:1812.22 E:0.093052 |  Tyro Mingz is just trying to run it off on that far side.
[261.36 - 263.76] P:1669.77 E:0.102922 |  But Unai Emery has actually told Pao Torres
[263.76 - 267.36] P:1872.25 E:0.082865 |  just to step up his warming up as he limbers on the touchline
[267.36 - 268.80] P:1869.33 E:0.094679 |  here at Everton's new home.
[268.80 - 271.36] P:1745.30 E:0.093179 |  Niel nil in the early stages, four and a half minutes play.
[271.36 - 272.96] P:1695.63 E:0.092027 |  Well, there should be 1-0 down, Aston Villa.
[272.96 - 274.56] P:1723.27 E:0.094654 |  It's a brilliant chance for Beto,
[274.56 - 276.72] P:1784.95 E:0.088445 |  and as it comes across to his right foot,
[276.72 - 278.72] P:1856.37 E:0.094608 |  he miscues it with his right foot,
[278.72 - 280.56] P:1680.68 E:0.086223 |  and it hits his standing left foot.
[280.56 - 282.00] P:1650.02 E:0.092564 |  It's a shocker from Beto.
[282.00 - 282.96] P:1616.52 E:0.082328 |  It's a simple tapping.
[283.52 - 285.12] P:1662.88 E:0.091939 |  You must say that should be 1-0.
[285.92 - 289.28] P:1772.88 E:0.098575 |  We welcome listeners to the BBC World Service.
[289.28 - 290.48] P:1596.20 E:0.113312 |  Wherever you are in the world,
[290.48 - 294.72] P:1728.50 E:0.082027 |  it is a pleasure to have your company here at Everton's new home,
[294.72 - 298.40] P:1726.96 E:0.080460 |  where it is nil-nil between Everton and Aston Villa.
[298.96 - 301.20] P:1633.46 E:0.090798 |  Port Vale, who are yet to win this season in League 1,
[301.20 - 303.44] P:1760.36 E:0.084529 |  though have taken the lead at St James's Park,
[303.44 - 304.24] P:1702.97 E:0.092247 |  Exeter City nil.
[304.24 - 306.80] P:1616.44 E:0.094617 |  Port Vale 1 is the latest score in League 1,
[306.80 - 310.24] P:1732.97 E:0.082710 |  and Mingz, who had been off the field for the last two minutes,
[310.24 - 312.64] P:1611.82 E:0.086898 |  is back and able to participate.
[313.60 - 315.28] P:1705.20 E:0.114965 |  So whether you're listening on the World Service,
[315.28 - 317.20] P:1612.60 E:0.096710 |  five live or through the BBC Sounds app,
[317.92 - 320.56] P:1573.51 E:0.101777 |  they had torrential rain probably about an hour ago,
[320.56 - 321.76] P:1714.56 E:0.090960 |  but now the sun is shining.
[322.32 - 323.92] P:1675.20 E:0.101529 |  There's a pocket of blue sky
[324.80 - 327.12] P:1647.79 E:0.090579 |  away towards our left-hand side as McGinn.
[327.76 - 329.84] P:1680.62 E:0.094233 |  Closed down by Irribunam.
[330.48 - 332.96] P:1615.59 E:0.089842 |  You think of Irribunam and Dean Nehring-Grealish.
[332.96 - 336.40] P:1728.59 E:0.090795 |  There are a number of players in this respective starting 11s
[336.40 - 339.60] P:1850.52 E:0.094479 |  coming up against the former clubs, this Illiman and Jai.
[339.60 - 341.04] P:1828.03 E:0.100071 |  It was a doubt coming into the game,
[341.04 - 344.08] P:1871.08 E:0.096246 |  but he looks rather sprightly, picks it up, darts forward,
[344.08 - 348.56] P:1831.87 E:0.093829 |  lays it off towards Jewsbury Hall, now out towards Grealish.
[348.56 - 350.40] P:1804.04 E:0.098006 |  And Grealish waits on this left-touch line,
[350.40 - 353.84] P:1833.43 E:0.073744 |  running on his toes as Cash backpedals.
[354.40 - 358.08] P:1751.09 E:0.088848 |  Grealish teasing him, dragging the ball slowly with that right leg.
[358.88 - 362.40] P:1789.44 E:0.079732 |  And then in field to Irribunam, now with Keane.
[362.40 - 364.48] P:1639.49 E:0.102706 |  Every outfield player in the Aston Villa half,
[364.48 - 368.16] P:1668.46 E:0.079181 |  Everton attacking, the North stand from right to left.
[369.04 - 372.88] P:1726.80 E:0.092646 |  This is Gae, back with Tarkovsky.
[373.44 - 375.84] P:1657.77 E:0.094065 |  There's a confidence, isn't there, about Everton-Steven?
[375.84 - 378.08] P:1660.22 E:0.104349 |  Yeah, there's a difference in the way that they set up as well.
[378.08 - 379.36] P:1711.01 E:0.097508 |  Now you've got two wide players
[379.36 - 382.08] P:1690.65 E:0.096513 |  who like to take people on in Grealish and Jai,
[382.08 - 385.20] P:1742.39 E:0.086028 |  and they've got problem-causers for the opposition.
[385.20 - 387.12] P:1593.57 E:0.076721 |  And that's exactly what you want now.
[387.12 - 390.96] P:1699.54 E:0.081030 |  It's about getting with the look more confident in possession.
[390.96 - 392.72] P:1734.63 E:0.082240 |  I just wanted to touch on Aston Villa though.
[392.72 - 395.68] P:1565.65 E:0.095135 |  I'm very surprised that you've got John McGinn on the right-hand side
[395.68 - 398.48] P:1790.56 E:0.077130 |  when you've got James Garner playing left back.
[399.04 - 401.20] P:1647.09 E:0.094990 |  Well, McGinn's going to come in on his stronger left foot,
[401.20 - 403.20] P:1799.87 E:0.086908 |  and that suits James Garner.
[403.20 - 405.20] P:1781.71 E:0.117082 |  Here is Jai, right-to-one challenge.
[405.20 - 406.48] P:1754.40 E:0.117085 |  Referee Simon Hooper.
[407.76 - 409.36] P:1752.90 E:0.114904 |  I thought maybe he had a good look,
[409.36 - 411.28] P:1799.78 E:0.097228 |  and it might have given a free kick there to Everton,
[411.28 - 413.60] P:1718.86 E:0.090744 |  but he says instead it will be a goal kick.
[413.60 - 416.64] P:1849.10 E:0.075764 |  And Jai has looked extremely sharp.
[417.20 - 420.00] P:1767.56 E:0.092750 |  And he was part of that Senegal side
[420.00 - 421.44] P:1655.97 E:0.085087 |  that went to the top of their group
[421.44 - 423.60] P:1748.14 E:0.095037 |  in world-class qualifying in dramatic fashion.
[424.40 - 428.32] P:1699.92 E:0.103406 |  Coming from 2-0 down to beat Diar Congo 3-2.
[428.32 - 431.04] P:1709.20 E:0.097107 |  It also got a good win against Sudan as well.
[431.04 - 436.48] P:1602.75 E:0.075547 |  So, and Jai has certainly had a rather eventful international break.
[437.12 - 442.64] P:1685.23 E:0.084653 |  As Emi Martinez is eventually going to be closed down by Jusbri Hall.
[442.64 - 444.08] P:1948.33 E:0.082641 |  The goal kick was taken short.
[445.04 - 447.20] P:1853.70 E:0.067482 |  Everton oppressing, high up the pitch.
[447.20 - 447.68] P:2121.69 E:0.076966 |  Cash.
[449.76 - 452.40] P:1856.18 E:0.116153 |  Now with concert, and he caught in possession.
[452.40 - 453.44] P:1812.84 E:0.119061 |  Here is Jusbri Hall.
[453.44 - 455.52] P:1817.58 E:0.095141 |  He tees up gay, tries to place it, blocks.
[455.52 - 457.52] P:1820.50 E:0.100041 |  Mike Volta-Grealish wouldn't sit for him.
[457.52 - 459.04] P:1894.73 E:0.098435 |  Grealish tries to kill it now.
[459.04 - 460.32] P:1805.26 E:0.104133 |  Far post on the stretch.
[460.32 - 462.24] P:1745.63 E:0.112134 |  Beto's header clawed out, flags up.
[463.92 - 464.72] P:1809.55 E:0.119884 |  The whistle had gone.
[465.36 - 466.48] P:1810.27 E:0.104002 |  They're appealing for handball,
[466.48 - 468.40] P:1658.10 E:0.101932 |  but the whistle had gone because of the flag was up.
[469.36 - 472.32] P:1763.64 E:0.097295 |  But Ashton Villa again under real pressure.
[472.32 - 475.76] P:1769.53 E:0.109129 |  Well, it's still played out from the back and get caught,
[475.76 - 478.48] P:1763.89 E:0.101587 |  and everyone wonders why you try and play out from the back.
[478.48 - 482.32] P:1639.11 E:0.099830 |  And it's a dangerous ball from Konza into the midfield.
[482.40 - 484.72] P:1721.62 E:0.103622 |  Into Bogart, he gets caught in possession.
[484.72 - 487.68] P:1692.55 E:0.070011 |  He's too slow, gets his pocket picked.
[487.68 - 490.88] P:1748.12 E:0.087321 |  But the ball in from Grealish to the back post from Beto.
[490.88 - 492.80] P:1880.08 E:0.082908 |  Yes, it was offside, but the save.
[492.80 - 495.44] P:1782.89 E:0.087879 |  That's why he's playing Martinez, outstanding save.
[496.00 - 497.04] P:1671.29 E:0.108942 |  Did ever so well.
[497.04 - 499.28] P:1846.27 E:0.094428 |  Strong left hand, just managed to claw it away
[499.28 - 501.84] P:1728.99 E:0.090699 |  as he reached towards that top corner,
[501.84 - 503.36] P:1657.70 E:0.079577 |  his top left hand corner.
[503.36 - 504.48] P:1644.53 E:0.099394 |  Nil Nillet remains.
[504.48 - 506.80] P:1818.47 E:0.091726 |  Commentsary on Sports Extra, his new Castle walls.
[506.80 - 508.16] P:1673.62 E:0.087030 |  Mike Minay has the latest.
[508.96 - 511.04] P:1795.13 E:0.106819 |  And it is Nil Nil, Hwang close,
[511.04 - 513.92] P:1923.77 E:0.099922 |  twice in the opening minute, one shot deflected from the resultant corner
[513.92 - 515.60] P:1998.43 E:0.098364 |  of volley that forced Pope into a save.
[515.60 - 518.32] P:1858.34 E:0.092494 |  Murphy's had a dipping shot just wide for the home side,
[518.32 - 520.32] P:1700.02 E:0.100910 |  but it is still Newcastle Nil, Wolves Nil.
[521.20 - 522.72] P:1806.60 E:0.079852 |  Been a strong start from Everton.
[522.72 - 525.04] P:1774.79 E:0.080126 |  It's been a very good start from Everton, quick.
[525.04 - 528.88] P:1678.37 E:0.082502 |  Obviously the new ground, the noise around the stadium,
[528.88 - 530.56] P:1635.03 E:0.095184 |  it's really picked the Everton players up.
[530.56 - 534.80] P:1643.60 E:0.077939 |  But one thing you said to me before was the difference in Everton,
[534.80 - 536.08] P:1447.23 E:0.079647 |  their athletic up front.
[536.08 - 538.32] P:1613.27 E:0.090613 |  That's the difference that they bought into this team.
[538.32 - 539.20] P:1593.18 E:0.094947 |  That's what they've added.
[539.84 - 541.44] P:1672.53 E:0.105255 |  Crystal Palace Sunderland, John Bennett.
[542.00 - 544.80] P:1857.27 E:0.106602 |  It's Nil Nil, but Sunderland are looking really confident.
[544.80 - 547.44] P:1781.53 E:0.094951 |  Adiara Cross almost picking out Isidore.
[547.44 - 550.16] P:1872.05 E:0.106788 |  Crystal Palace restricted to a lern-mash or over, Nil Nil.
[550.96 - 552.56] P:1679.10 E:0.103830 |  And they're not afraid to go direct.
[553.12 - 555.44] P:1831.11 E:0.094570 |  I thought I was quite safe in handing to John there,
[555.44 - 558.32] P:1797.04 E:0.089514 |  and Tarkovsky all of a sudden has hit a long pass.
[558.32 - 560.24] P:1801.06 E:0.084549 |  It must have been a good 50, 60 yards,
[560.24 - 563.76] P:1784.06 E:0.079390 |  drops over the shoulder and just got away from Beto.
[563.76 - 566.16] P:1547.42 E:0.079195 |  But as it went over the head, it was Mingz, wasn't it?
[566.16 - 568.00] P:1651.93 E:0.103944 |  Yeah, Mingz just didn't read the flight to the ball.
[568.00 - 570.16] P:1767.58 E:0.093134 |  I think he thought it was going closer to his goalkeeper,
[570.16 - 572.08] P:1567.91 E:0.087670 |  and whether his goalkeeper might have come and claimed it.
[572.08 - 576.32] P:1766.92 E:0.089835 |  But Beto, a loose touch, very difficult skill to bring it down.
[576.32 - 578.80] P:1664.60 E:0.084677 |  Might have been better trying to hit it first time
[578.80 - 580.16] P:1887.96 E:0.100757 |  as it dropped over his shoulder.
[580.16 - 582.16] P:1815.35 E:0.107089 |  But it's all Everton at the moment,
[582.16 - 586.08] P:1842.60 E:0.087151 |  and Matty Kacznall concedes a free kick in a dangerous position.
[586.08 - 589.52] P:1797.37 E:0.092983 |  Barnsley lead Reading by a goal to Nil in League One at Oakwell.
[589.52 - 591.84] P:1946.67 E:0.093760 |  And another goal in South Yorkshire is at Hillsborough,
[591.84 - 594.56] P:1862.14 E:0.087231 |  Sheffield Wednesday, Nil, Bristol City, one.
[594.56 - 597.44] P:1826.82 E:0.082420 |  We'll get news of that after this free kick.
[598.40 - 600.40] P:1719.24 E:0.097405 |  Which Everton are going to take.
[600.40 - 603.04] P:1671.69 E:0.098609 |  It's level with the penalty area on the left-hand side.
[603.04 - 605.60] P:1670.21 E:0.101189 |  Jusbree Hall and Garner are the two standing over it.
[605.60 - 607.60] P:1622.26 E:0.094821 |  Aston Villa have got everybody back.
[607.60 - 610.56] P:1655.50 E:0.103815 |  Good noise inside the impressive arena here,
[611.28 - 612.96] P:1756.04 E:0.096587 |  down by the docks in Liverpool.
[613.92 - 616.48] P:1809.06 E:0.102014 |  Seamus Coleman is just starting to warm up.
[616.48 - 619.12] P:1825.36 E:0.100049 |  So Garner with the in-swinger, Jusbree Hall with the out-swinger.
[619.12 - 621.12] P:1686.86 E:0.093974 |  Nil, Nil. Garner's going to leave it.
[621.12 - 623.20] P:1823.45 E:0.103227 |  Jusbree Hall to take it, and it comes now,
[623.20 - 625.52] P:1664.42 E:0.095035 |  and the header from Michael Keeney is off target.
[625.52 - 627.60] P:1815.33 E:0.099618 |  So I promised that goal at Hillsborough, Betty Glover.
[628.72 - 630.24] P:1711.04 E:0.095877 |  Bad start for Sheffield Wednesday.
[630.24 - 631.60] P:1534.90 E:0.100002 |  It's been coming for Bristol.
[631.60 - 633.68] P:1592.92 E:0.101443 |  Balls swung in. Scott Twine cut the ball back.
[633.68 - 635.84] P:1590.57 E:0.088500 |  Dickie ran on to it and got it into the back of the net.
[635.84 - 638.80] P:1540.77 E:0.089789 |  Easy as you like. Sheffield Wednesday, Nil, Bristol City, one.
[638.80 - 640.96] P:1638.48 E:0.109564 |  Sheffield Wednesday, who are yet to win.
[640.96 - 645.04] P:1749.71 E:0.101169 |  Bristol City, who are actually still unbeaten this season.
[646.24 - 650.80] P:1734.95 E:0.086836 |  And then Martinez again is going to eventually clear his lines
[650.80 - 653.52] P:1828.43 E:0.073481 |  from another short goal kick.
[653.52 - 655.76] P:1793.68 E:0.099897 |  And once again, it's met by a blue shirt in Everton.
[655.76 - 657.20] P:1798.34 E:0.099245 |  In fact, Tarkovsky was fouled.
[658.00 - 659.68] P:1783.86 E:0.105744 |  Aston Villages can't get into the game.
[659.68 - 661.20] P:1622.08 E:0.100507 |  No, they can't. They can't get a foothold.
[661.20 - 664.72] P:1698.44 E:0.091477 |  The ball out from Martinez wasn't great into Buendia.
[664.72 - 668.64] P:1703.99 E:0.085678 |  Tarkovsky stepped out off Oli Watkins and won the first ball.
[668.64 - 671.04] P:1638.23 E:0.064062 |  And I think you say that the finding,
[671.04 - 672.80] P:1619.09 E:0.096329 |  struggling to find a foothold in the game,
[672.80 - 676.48] P:1739.70 E:0.076404 |  but Everton, great start so far within the first 12 minutes.
[676.48 - 680.72] P:1710.28 E:0.078315 |  Jusbree Hall has also had a rather impressive early start
[680.72 - 681.84] P:1762.42 E:0.108659 |  to his Everton career.
[681.84 - 684.08] P:1832.95 E:0.082906 |  He's actually played more minutes before today,
[684.08 - 685.84] P:1755.96 E:0.087605 |  270 minutes in the Premier League
[685.92 - 688.64] P:1763.31 E:0.095714 |  than he did throughout his Premier League time at Chelsea.
[689.20 - 693.52] P:1743.76 E:0.099697 |  And no English player has created more chances so far in the top flight
[693.52 - 696.56] P:1836.43 E:0.095289 |  as Grealish holds off Rodgers back towards Ghana.
[697.36 - 701.28] P:1691.60 E:0.087650 |  And Ghana will go all the way back to Irebunem to Pickford.
[702.00 - 704.24] P:1807.99 E:0.100137 |  Pickford just plays it out of his penalty area
[704.24 - 705.76] P:1596.43 E:0.096714 |  in green away towards their right.
[705.76 - 706.80] P:1767.44 E:0.086729 |  Downfield it goes.
[707.84 - 710.40] P:1772.36 E:0.104625 |  Headed away by Buendia before it can reach better.
[710.40 - 714.32] P:1881.07 E:0.107248 |  Irebunem now slides in, out it goes for a throw on that far side.
[714.40 - 717.04] P:1766.87 E:0.093340 |  Aaron Ball is Aaron Pauls at Craven Cottage, Fullham Leeds.
[717.04 - 719.04] P:1728.71 E:0.117728 |  Nel Nel here, Fullham Nel leads Nel.
[719.04 - 722.40] P:1906.98 E:0.095983 |  Really bitey feisty battle between these two sides.
[722.40 - 724.72] P:1823.98 E:0.096131 |  No concrete chances, but Fullham with a free kick
[724.72 - 727.04] P:1825.15 E:0.099058 |  and a dangerous position over on the far side.
[727.04 - 729.04] P:1751.17 E:0.104917 |  Harry Wilson stepping up to take it. Nel Nel.
[729.60 - 733.20] P:1828.00 E:0.096851 |  With an athletic leading Doncaster Rovers by a goal to Nel in League 1.
[733.20 - 737.04] P:1797.31 E:0.091293 |  It's the goal service and the commentary here on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[737.04 - 741.12] P:1884.53 E:0.099450 |  Ball up towards Watkins, Tarkovsky will usher that ball
[741.12 - 743.68] P:1874.84 E:0.093567 |  all the way back to Jordan Pickford.
[744.56 - 746.48] P:1761.73 E:0.103428 |  Away towards our right-hand side.
[746.48 - 750.64] P:1790.21 E:0.079031 |  Pickford is 450th club appearance of his career.
[751.36 - 755.04] P:1721.17 E:0.101565 |  As again, Everton prepared to go direct up towards Beto.
[755.04 - 756.48] P:1777.44 E:0.103318 |  Makes that run in behind Doncaster.
[756.48 - 758.96] P:1828.22 E:0.111351 |  Pickford's England teammate lays it off towards Greeley.
[758.96 - 761.04] P:1809.19 E:0.100154 |  He's quickly on the attack, running with purpose
[761.04 - 763.04] P:1760.32 E:0.083404 |  into the penalty area left-hand side.
[763.04 - 765.44] P:1809.36 E:0.082230 |  Plays it back, Jewsbury Hall looks at his options.
[765.44 - 768.24] P:1652.86 E:0.078248 |  Garner provides the support now from left back.
[768.24 - 769.28] P:1738.15 E:0.102116 |  Back to Jewsbury Hall.
[770.16 - 773.92] P:1735.64 E:0.084559 |  Here once again is Garner cutting in now off the left.
[773.92 - 778.16] P:1767.28 E:0.088420 |  Touchline lays it off and the ball from Irribunam back towards Keen.
[778.16 - 780.00] P:1723.65 E:0.102073 |  And then Keen will go back towards Pickford.
[781.04 - 785.20] P:1678.23 E:0.100881 |  They are playing with a degree of control, 13 minutes in, Nel Nel.
[785.20 - 788.24] P:1595.00 E:0.098025 |  Yeah, they had an opportunity there to swing the ball into the box.
[788.24 - 789.28] P:1723.55 E:0.094260 |  They refused it.
[789.28 - 792.24] P:1701.93 E:0.098921 |  Thought Garner was just going to whip it in on that right forecourt.
[792.80 - 794.00] P:1827.90 E:0.121168 |  Beto's a willing runner.
[794.00 - 794.64] P:1868.09 E:0.105446 |  He really is.
[794.64 - 797.04] P:1781.97 E:0.083492 |  He makes some great runs in behind.
[797.04 - 799.36] P:1719.91 E:0.090446 |  He stretches the backline of Aston Villa.
[799.36 - 800.80] P:1966.87 E:0.073071 |  It's just a shame he's finishing.
[800.80 - 803.12] P:1521.94 E:0.082358 |  He just doesn't have that confidence in front of goal
[803.12 - 806.40] P:1695.33 E:0.092379 |  because, as we said earlier on, Everton should have been 1-0 up.
[806.40 - 808.32] P:1611.54 E:0.075340 |  And this is a new thing this season, isn't it?
[808.32 - 809.04] P:1381.18 E:0.099244 |  Long throws.
[809.68 - 810.08] P:1425.07 E:0.072125 |  Yes.
[810.08 - 812.32] P:1564.42 E:0.102097 |  Going back to the old school of long throws.
[815.20 - 817.84] P:1665.13 E:0.101874 |  Old school is new school, said Chris Wilder
[817.84 - 821.92] P:1671.97 E:0.092555 |  as the league managers association many a long time ago.
[821.92 - 824.08] P:1706.02 E:0.093199 |  As in comes the throw, flicks on.
[825.12 - 827.20] P:1645.50 E:0.105736 |  Mind you, there's a few Sheffield United fans
[827.20 - 829.52] P:1721.58 E:0.098048 |  who still wish they had Chris Wilder in charge.
[829.52 - 830.56] P:1778.76 E:0.100119 |  I was going to say the same he said.
[830.56 - 831.52] P:1405.16 E:0.102149 |  My word.
[831.52 - 832.88] P:1755.52 E:0.093800 |  Grass isn't always greener.
[832.88 - 835.52] P:1693.50 E:0.093590 |  No. Heading away by Irribune.
[838.00 - 840.24] P:1725.74 E:0.110759 |  What a sorry start it has been for the Blades.
[840.24 - 842.88] P:1791.45 E:0.092403 |  Losing last night 5-0 at Ipswich.
[845.28 - 846.80] P:1656.12 E:0.108831 |  And Sheffield Wednesday.
[847.68 - 849.60] P:1800.19 E:0.074799 |  Not a good time for the Steel City.
[849.60 - 852.00] P:1680.87 E:0.110099 |  Whichever year, allegiance in that part of the world.
[853.12 - 855.04] P:1770.26 E:0.098161 |  Here's the blue and white of Everton.
[855.04 - 858.32] P:1788.95 E:0.092940 |  They've made their best start in four seasons.
[858.88 - 860.96] P:1759.70 E:0.103473 |  However, Rogers picks up on a loose ball
[860.96 - 863.20] P:1796.38 E:0.111345 |  but it was a weak forward ball towards Watkins
[863.20 - 865.68] P:1827.55 E:0.092706 |  and easily cut out by Tarkovsky.
[865.68 - 866.80] P:1813.96 E:0.098145 |  Look back at Everton.
[866.80 - 869.36] P:1721.01 E:0.091643 |  Everton have failed to win any of their opening five games
[869.36 - 871.04] P:1806.70 E:0.093506 |  in the last three seasons.
[872.32 - 874.24] P:1876.93 E:0.113430 |  New surroundings, new start, new feel.
[875.12 - 877.60] P:1697.28 E:0.087793 |  And Grealish on this near side, the left.
[877.60 - 879.20] P:1817.89 E:0.084604 |  Back towards Jewsbury Hall.
[879.20 - 880.80] P:1749.60 E:0.090423 |  Wigan Athletic have got a second goal.
[880.80 - 883.52] P:1780.55 E:0.093007 |  They now lead Doncaster Rovers by two goals to nil.
[884.16 - 888.40] P:1683.99 E:0.077520 |  Doncaster, who'd won their last five going into that game.
[888.40 - 890.00] P:1751.65 E:0.120933 |  And Jai rolls away
[890.64 - 891.28] P:1796.97 E:0.117516 |  from Dynia.
[892.00 - 895.04] P:1805.87 E:0.106851 |  Runs forward, low cross into the penalty area.
[895.04 - 898.56] P:1834.23 E:0.109714 |  And it's cleared by Bogard out for an Everton throw.
[898.56 - 900.24] P:1830.88 E:0.099194 |  John Bennett's at Crystal Palace.
[900.80 - 903.04] P:1840.22 E:0.116584 |  Crystal Palace nil, Sunderland nil, Sunderland.
[903.04 - 904.72] P:1733.28 E:0.102832 |  Continue to be the better side.
[904.72 - 907.44] P:1873.92 E:0.094115 |  Noah Siddiqui with a chance left-footed shot,
[907.44 - 909.44] P:1729.28 E:0.101716 |  tight angle over the bar and wide.
[909.44 - 910.88] P:1921.01 E:0.096292 |  Crystal Palace nil, Sunderland nil.
[911.68 - 913.76] P:1714.72 E:0.076278 |  Talking of Sheffield United, you'd have seen
[913.76 - 916.40] P:1645.05 E:0.095539 |  Illiman and Jai many a time at Bramble Lane.
[916.96 - 919.44] P:1716.50 E:0.088465 |  And he's back in English football after that.
[919.44 - 920.56] P:1835.35 E:0.100649 |  Spal at Marseille.
[921.12 - 923.36] P:1806.51 E:0.106194 |  But he is one of those players who you enjoy to watch.
[923.36 - 925.76] P:1751.77 E:0.089561 |  He just glides across the service from the long throw.
[925.76 - 928.64] P:1870.58 E:0.103063 |  Better with a turn, strikes Tarkovsky, falls to Grealish.
[928.64 - 931.28] P:1698.17 E:0.113144 |  Saved by the legs of Martinez, spooned up in the air.
[931.28 - 933.44] P:1739.88 E:0.103632 |  And in the end, it was Mings, who has to get there
[933.44 - 936.48] P:1844.77 E:0.107695 |  before his own goalkeeper to head it behind for a corner kick.
[936.48 - 938.40] P:1842.12 E:0.102597 |  Blingwood leave, walks all by a goal to nil.
[938.40 - 940.80] P:1680.82 E:0.103651 |  Musta took a deflection from the shot from Grealish
[940.80 - 943.52] P:1669.00 E:0.101970 |  because it just wrong-footed Emi Martinez
[943.52 - 944.56] P:1635.73 E:0.109742 |  in the Aston Villa goal.
[944.56 - 946.48] P:1580.11 E:0.086880 |  But it's that long throw in.
[946.56 - 949.68] P:1700.60 E:0.084221 |  Crystal, Michael Keane gets the first flick on
[949.68 - 950.88] P:1684.93 E:0.098660 |  and then he keep it alive.
[950.88 - 954.00] P:1771.30 E:0.090869 |  And as it falls to the feet of Grealish, really good strike low.
[954.80 - 957.92] P:1643.94 E:0.086026 |  Is it just a matter of time before Everton make the breakthrough?
[957.92 - 960.32] P:1700.67 E:0.092096 |  Luchentown nil, Plymouth one in League One.
[960.32 - 963.36] P:1721.77 E:0.097609 |  Bristol Rovers one, Barrow nil is the latest score in League Two.
[963.36 - 965.92] P:1748.11 E:0.088560 |  You're up to date, five live in the World Service.
[965.92 - 968.00] P:1699.46 E:0.096930 |  Everton have a corner kick right-hand side.
[968.00 - 970.96] P:1802.24 E:0.094931 |  Jewsbury Hall, an orthodox from the goalkeeper
[970.96 - 972.40] P:1730.23 E:0.114103 |  with a referee's whistle has blown.
[972.96 - 975.04] P:1677.85 E:0.100047 |  Ghana had knocked the ball into the empty net,
[975.04 - 977.20] P:1705.57 E:0.082603 |  but the whistle had long since blown.
[978.32 - 980.56] P:1581.66 E:0.101744 |  I can only imagine now I say on orthodox
[980.56 - 983.60] P:1673.81 E:0.074566 |  because he must have been held away that somehow
[983.60 - 988.08] P:1691.72 E:0.079634 |  he managed to get a left hand to it as he fell to the ground.
[988.08 - 990.56] P:1724.65 E:0.097774 |  Jack Grealish had hold of his other arm,
[991.12 - 993.12] P:1651.88 E:0.088550 |  sort of interlocked if you like.
[993.12 - 995.68] P:1625.29 E:0.085177 |  And Emi Martinez couldn't get off the ground,
[995.68 - 999.44] P:1617.88 E:0.079071 |  could only get a single hand to it and a punch and a referee
[999.44 - 1001.28] P:1741.84 E:0.107430 |  saw it straight away, Simon Hooper.
[1001.60 - 1004.96] P:1609.46 E:0.074589 |  Now Aston Villa with Bwendir,
[1004.96 - 1010.72] P:1616.84 E:0.093583 |  placing out to Farside to Dynia, back with Bwendir.
[1010.72 - 1013.60] P:1676.66 E:0.099923 |  We've got world title boxing on five live tonight.
[1013.60 - 1017.12] P:1724.78 E:0.086622 |  In fact, the undercard will start at seven o'clock on Sports Extra Two,
[1017.12 - 1021.04] P:1668.39 E:0.093885 |  but that fight in Belfast between Lewis Crocker and Paddy Donovan
[1021.04 - 1023.44] P:1886.51 E:0.104835 |  is at five live at ten.
[1023.44 - 1027.28] P:1854.52 E:0.095670 |  And in boxing parlance here, Aston Villa are on the ropes.
[1027.28 - 1028.48] P:1844.97 E:0.092819 |  They certainly are.
[1028.56 - 1031.60] P:1712.85 E:0.081369 |  They're trying to find a way out of this press from Everton.
[1031.60 - 1034.72] P:1675.69 E:0.092312 |  They're trying to make sure that Everton can't play long direct balls,
[1034.72 - 1039.44] P:1725.03 E:0.082862 |  but Unai Emery hasn't moved out of his technical area down in front of us.
[1039.44 - 1040.72] P:1681.07 E:0.081054 |  He is not happy at all.
[1041.44 - 1046.00] P:1719.44 E:0.075285 |  Well, they've got a throw, have Aston Villa,
[1046.56 - 1049.52] P:1688.27 E:0.103068 |  which is down by the corner flag as they play from left to right,
[1050.16 - 1054.08] P:1796.17 E:0.087121 |  attacking that giant south stand that holds 13,000 supporters.
[1054.72 - 1055.92] P:1861.24 E:0.097261 |  Cash waits to take it.
[1056.88 - 1059.04] P:1784.02 E:0.121604 |  And then that was surely a foul throw.
[1059.92 - 1063.12] P:1777.64 E:0.113341 |  That gives us an opportunity to hear of a goal at Bournemouth to Hellside.
[1063.12 - 1065.52] P:1865.23 E:0.100420 |  Bournemouth have the lead, Bournemouth one, Brighton nil.
[1065.52 - 1068.80] P:1871.14 E:0.103462 |  It's come out of nothing the ball was bobbling about on the edge of the area.
[1068.80 - 1072.80] P:1929.27 E:0.085451 |  Alex Scott picked it up, turned beautifully, last hit home, left footed,
[1072.80 - 1076.64] P:1927.87 E:0.089165 |  18 yards out, what a finish. Bournemouth one, Brighton nil.
[1077.60 - 1081.76] P:1641.31 E:0.074025 |  And an opportunity to put Everton under pressure, and then that happens.
[1082.40 - 1084.00] P:1715.46 E:0.101143 |  Such a poor throw from Matty Cash.
[1084.08 - 1088.40] P:1834.76 E:0.091132 |  And again, you look at Unai Emery's body language, shrugging the shoulders,
[1088.40 - 1091.20] P:1651.71 E:0.087256 |  sort of looking down at the floor, not impressed.
[1091.20 - 1092.56] P:1758.80 E:0.092784 |  One bit by Matty Cash.
[1093.12 - 1094.64] P:1626.88 E:0.107642 |  But they haven't started well, Villa.
[1094.64 - 1098.48] P:1622.84 E:0.085443 |  They need to up the game because if they don't, it could be a long, long afternoon.
[1099.28 - 1101.92] P:1713.90 E:0.081776 |  Gay actually strikes him and runs away from him the ball,
[1101.92 - 1104.24] P:1737.19 E:0.086767 |  and Telemans then will tie it up for Aston Villa.
[1104.24 - 1106.88] P:1785.26 E:0.078790 |  Mings then passes the ball out towards Deena.
[1106.88 - 1108.48] P:1724.56 E:0.113173 |  Will he keep the ball in play? Yes, he will.
[1108.48 - 1111.04] P:1800.20 E:0.098232 |  That's like Celery to do so, down by the corner flag.
[1111.12 - 1112.56] P:1905.48 E:0.085932 |  Deena now with a cross.
[1112.56 - 1115.60] P:1744.80 E:0.095108 |  O'Brien is there to head it away on the near side of the six-yard box.
[1116.16 - 1118.32] P:1796.88 E:0.094337 |  Telemans plays the ball back to...
[1119.68 - 1120.24] P:1788.10 E:0.074953 |  Concert.
[1120.24 - 1123.36] P:1829.89 E:0.097529 |  His forward ball, Wendia able to turn to Rogers.
[1124.08 - 1127.44] P:1816.77 E:0.094705 |  Rogers, his challenge almost falls into the path of Wendia.
[1127.44 - 1128.32] P:1824.31 E:0.142275 |  Keen will clear.
[1128.96 - 1129.92] P:1800.31 E:0.108009 |  Beto and Mings.
[1131.04 - 1136.16] P:1765.63 E:0.092887 |  No foul, says Simon Hooper, as Mings comes away with the ball over on that far side.
[1137.12 - 1140.64] P:1844.37 E:0.080691 |  Now it's with Rogers, leaving it for Wendia.
[1141.12 - 1143.44] P:1887.46 E:0.103455 |  Stepping into the challenge was Tarkovsky,
[1143.44 - 1145.28] P:1774.71 E:0.113955 |  and then giving it now to Irribunin.
[1145.28 - 1148.16] P:1707.10 E:0.098390 |  And Irribunin will run forward with it towards the halfway line.
[1148.16 - 1151.36] P:1808.65 E:0.089990 |  Gay has gone out wide on the right-hand side, drops to his knees.
[1151.36 - 1153.60] P:1732.40 E:0.095363 |  Simon Hooper will say that will be a free kick.
[1153.60 - 1155.92] P:1810.19 E:0.091123 |  When you look at the various clubs in the Premier League
[1155.92 - 1158.00] P:1798.46 E:0.063383 |  who have players on international duty,
[1158.00 - 1161.36] P:1710.12 E:0.062486 |  Everton had eight, only Leeds United
[1161.36 - 1165.60] P:1771.47 E:0.077616 |  of the Premier League clubs had fewer on international duty with five.
[1165.60 - 1168.96] P:1773.57 E:0.070478 |  So in that respect, David Moyes would have had a...
[1169.04 - 1172.24] P:1708.40 E:0.097478 |  Still, I would guess, a nucleus of this squad that he's been able to work with.
[1172.24 - 1174.08] P:1718.08 E:0.106445 |  Yeah, but it depends how you manage that time.
[1174.08 - 1176.72] P:1760.38 E:0.097585 |  Do you over-train the players? Do you under-train them?
[1176.72 - 1180.24] P:1780.81 E:0.094985 |  How much time do you give them off with it being so early on in the season?
[1180.24 - 1183.84] P:1781.52 E:0.100834 |  I was actually flying out last Friday to Spain.
[1183.84 - 1186.08] P:1641.15 E:0.095408 |  I saw one of the Everton players in the airport as well,
[1186.08 - 1188.08] P:1667.73 E:0.100220 |  so they obviously have been given a little bit of time off.
[1188.88 - 1190.08] P:1723.53 E:0.077482 |  But it's how you manage it.
[1190.08 - 1192.40] P:1762.70 E:0.083668 |  It's not as simple as just saying, oh, you get rest.
[1192.96 - 1194.64] P:1587.06 E:0.081469 |  Rest doesn't mean everything in football.
[1194.64 - 1196.72] P:1751.15 E:0.097061 |  You've still got to keep them active and busy.
[1197.44 - 1201.44] P:1789.41 E:0.094035 |  Ball up towards Beto, tries to stab it back into the path of Anjai.
[1201.44 - 1203.52] P:1828.72 E:0.096054 |  And Dina, who was the left back, just took in,
[1204.24 - 1206.72] P:1750.91 E:0.097110 |  was able to win it back for Aston Villa.
[1206.72 - 1208.88] P:1826.61 E:0.114731 |  That's Stephen Warnock who's offering us the insight
[1208.88 - 1210.32] P:1787.10 E:0.116555 |  for the England international, of course.
[1210.32 - 1210.96] P:1865.69 E:0.109290 |  Oh, wow.
[1210.96 - 1214.16] P:1776.75 E:0.117860 |  As the referee has given a free kick here.
[1216.00 - 1218.16] P:1783.24 E:0.113670 |  I thought he'd taken the ball cleanly.
[1218.16 - 1220.00] P:1806.10 E:0.105393 |  Yeah, I don't understand that.
[1220.00 - 1221.04] P:1763.22 E:0.110999 |  We need to see it again.
[1221.04 - 1224.16] P:1741.62 E:0.101288 |  Tarkovsky with his head in his hands, wondering how,
[1224.16 - 1227.28] P:1804.22 E:0.099487 |  and you can hear what the thoughts are in and around the fans.
[1227.28 - 1229.28] P:1823.50 E:0.095151 |  But straight away, I thought he'd won the ball.
[1230.16 - 1231.60] P:1712.83 E:0.097815 |  Goal at Coventry, Mark Webber.
[1232.64 - 1234.16] P:1846.73 E:0.114512 |  Where it's Coventry, 0, Norwich, 1.
[1234.16 - 1235.60] P:1731.81 E:0.112726 |  Against the Urana of early play,
[1235.60 - 1237.44] P:1784.03 E:0.103923 |  Messiah's Christgarden from Norwich,
[1237.44 - 1240.48] P:1707.05 E:0.097953 |  weaved into the area and managed to find space to slot it home
[1240.48 - 1242.24] P:1697.11 E:0.099442 |  to make it Coventry City, 0.
[1242.24 - 1243.20] P:1742.40 E:0.107030 |  Norwich City, 1.
[1244.32 - 1248.24] P:1810.97 E:0.108346 |  You can actually see the words of James Tarkovsky saying,
[1248.24 - 1253.28] P:1838.18 E:0.085714 |  I got the ball with which he did in the challenge with Morgan Rogers,
[1253.28 - 1255.20] P:1717.26 E:0.076918 |  and then his mouth, that's a joke.
[1255.20 - 1257.84] P:1704.38 E:0.092920 |  Yeah, he's saying the follow-through, Simon Hooper,
[1257.84 - 1259.92] P:1719.59 E:0.090587 |  is not right from James Tarkovsky.
[1259.92 - 1262.16] P:1620.76 E:0.091456 |  There's got to be contact in football.
[1262.16 - 1263.60] P:1717.12 E:0.102177 |  There's too many challenges now,
[1263.60 - 1265.36] P:1617.09 E:0.105861 |  where if you collide with a player,
[1265.36 - 1267.20] P:1542.65 E:0.092547 |  or there's a little bit of follow-through,
[1267.20 - 1269.68] P:1667.26 E:0.088129 |  that's called momentum, and that is part of football.
[1270.96 - 1272.24] P:1751.00 E:0.090992 |  No action was taken.
[1272.24 - 1276.08] P:1727.33 E:0.095154 |  Didn't see a yellow card from the referee, Simon Hooper.
[1276.08 - 1278.72] P:1826.82 E:0.103908 |  Peterbury united, a leading wickham by a goal to nil.
[1278.72 - 1280.64] P:1766.33 E:0.081949 |  Peterborough, who are yet to win.
[1280.64 - 1283.04] P:1758.35 E:0.089445 |  In fact, they haven't actually won since the 1st of April,
[1283.12 - 1287.20] P:1786.56 E:0.087169 |  against a wickham side without an away win in League 1 this season.
[1287.20 - 1289.52] P:1867.32 E:0.088762 |  And Bristol City have got a second goal at Hillsborough.
[1289.52 - 1291.28] P:1873.38 E:0.124909 |  Sheffield Wednesday, no, Bristol City 2.
[1291.28 - 1294.48] P:1866.90 E:0.116049 |  Luton have equalised, Luton won, Plymouth won, and you're up to date.
[1295.28 - 1298.16] P:1728.22 E:0.095563 |  As we will get an update from St James' Park, Mike Mane.
[1299.04 - 1300.96] P:1668.27 E:0.118929 |  21 minutes played, nil-nil.
[1300.96 - 1302.16] P:1698.79 E:0.093207 |  The Premier League's bottom side,
[1302.16 - 1304.24] P:1887.30 E:0.099473 |  Wolves giving themselves a really good account at the moment,
[1304.24 - 1305.68] P:1784.95 E:0.082411 |  testing the Newcastle defence.
[1305.68 - 1308.08] P:1833.14 E:0.097129 |  But you were talking of long throws not so long ago.
[1308.08 - 1310.48] P:1794.72 E:0.095234 |  Liberamento from the left-hand, side-course chaos.
[1310.48 - 1312.64] P:1875.10 E:0.100311 |  Murphy ghosting in on the back of the six-yard box.
[1312.72 - 1314.24] P:1894.41 E:0.086308 |  He'd hit it straight at Sam Johnston.
[1314.24 - 1315.68] P:1780.96 E:0.077834 |  Newcastle, nil-wolves, nil.
[1315.68 - 1317.12] P:1881.49 E:0.108215 |  Greenish, edge of the area.
[1317.12 - 1320.24] P:1847.48 E:0.088215 |  Doesn't shoot, comes back inside, and will win a corner.
[1320.24 - 1323.92] P:1874.19 E:0.106199 |  Comments with that one, by the way, Newcastle Wolves is on sports extra.
[1323.92 - 1326.16] P:1794.28 E:0.114006 |  Everton, the momentum is still with the home side.
[1326.16 - 1328.96] P:1774.70 E:0.102661 |  Stoke City won, Birmingham Mill is the latest scorer championship.
[1328.96 - 1329.44] P:1730.01 E:0.094835 |  Steven.
[1329.44 - 1332.48] P:1639.93 E:0.106673 |  Yeah, well, they're winning every second ball Everton in that midfield area.
[1333.04 - 1336.96] P:1818.89 E:0.092061 |  Aston Villa really struggling to win those competitive battles.
[1336.96 - 1340.16] P:1523.29 E:0.087956 |  And then, in wide areas, Everton are a lot more confident as well.
[1340.64 - 1342.56] P:1763.52 E:0.091700 |  So, Jewsfrey Hall places the ball down.
[1342.56 - 1344.72] P:1613.34 E:0.090116 |  Burton, Albion, nil, Lincoln City won.
[1344.72 - 1346.48] P:1600.53 E:0.098029 |  Burton, Albion without a winning four.
[1346.48 - 1351.28] P:1827.09 E:0.080752 |  Gary Bowie's side as Jewsfrey Hall waits on this near side, the left.
[1351.28 - 1353.60] P:1784.81 E:0.089005 |  Everton, Rawl, Blue shirts playing from right to left.
[1353.60 - 1356.16] P:1823.20 E:0.090986 |  Clips it in. Martínez is struggling.
[1356.16 - 1358.16] P:1767.82 E:0.089709 |  He actually fell backwards there.
[1358.16 - 1361.92] P:1805.26 E:0.102794 |  Tarkovsky, referee has given a free kick once again.
[1361.92 - 1363.36] P:1782.81 E:0.099815 |  So, let's get into that goal at Stoke.
[1363.36 - 1364.00] P:1738.56 E:0.089510 |  Pat Murphy.
[1364.00 - 1365.28] P:2003.81 E:0.109640 |  Goals come from the centre-back,
[1365.28 - 1368.56] P:2014.61 E:0.098701 |  Bowes and Lowell are high, stooping header from a corner.
[1368.64 - 1372.72] P:2008.65 E:0.093998 |  Olsopp, who just made a magnificent save from Mubamba, couldn't quite get it.
[1372.72 - 1373.68] P:2022.56 E:0.098578 |  They deserve it, Stoke.
[1373.68 - 1374.96] P:1841.77 E:0.089625 |  They're playing brilliantly.
[1374.96 - 1376.80] P:2117.67 E:0.089388 |  Stoke won, Birmingham, nil.
[1376.80 - 1379.28] P:1821.85 E:0.085074 |  And that second goal from Bristol City with Betty Glover.
[1380.32 - 1382.48] P:1642.92 E:0.089846 |  Emile Rees for this third of the season.
[1382.48 - 1384.56] P:1612.80 E:0.096654 |  Lovely ball from Emetti across the face of goal.
[1384.56 - 1385.52] P:1568.68 E:0.101013 |  Emile Rees was there.
[1385.52 - 1387.52] P:1659.69 E:0.082357 |  He was timed his run perfectly, tapped it in.
[1387.52 - 1391.04] P:1633.82 E:0.086363 |  Emetti down the left is so threatening, Wednesday can't contain him.
[1391.04 - 1393.04] P:1544.80 E:0.081170 |  Sheppard Wednesday, nil, Bristol City 2.
[1393.84 - 1394.56] P:1553.62 E:0.109765 |  Thank you, Betty.
[1394.56 - 1395.60] P:1974.02 E:0.104013 |  Here is Cash.
[1395.60 - 1397.04] P:1820.65 E:0.095217 |  Rogers can't control it.
[1397.04 - 1402.16] P:1827.62 E:0.089180 |  Will run through to Michael Keane, tied his up all the way back to Jordan Pickford.
[1402.72 - 1406.16] P:1798.35 E:0.107587 |  Seven successive clean sheets he's kept whilst he's been the England goalkeeper.
[1406.16 - 1408.08] P:1931.37 E:0.104396 |  But he's out of his goal there.
[1408.08 - 1413.52] P:1922.41 E:0.094331 |  And as it fell to Bwendia, Bwendia with the vision knew exactly what he wanted to do.
[1413.52 - 1417.36] P:1882.35 E:0.090554 |  And he must have been about six, seven yards forward of the centre-circle.
[1417.36 - 1420.96] P:1875.53 E:0.090463 |  And he's going to hit it first time right-footed, but it was off target.
[1420.96 - 1422.80] P:1820.03 E:0.083156 |  Yeah, well, Jordan Pickford himself,
[1422.80 - 1425.84] P:1811.63 E:0.084527 |  Pickford found himself almost in the left-back position.
[1425.84 - 1429.36] P:1767.06 E:0.089293 |  And as it dropped to Bwendia, he was miles out of his area.
[1429.36 - 1432.24] P:1761.32 E:0.074908 |  Just couldn't get the right purchase on the ball.
[1432.24 - 1434.40] P:1766.41 E:0.088641 |  He tried to drill it hard and low.
[1434.40 - 1435.84] P:1601.63 E:0.059029 |  It was a big opportunity.
[1435.84 - 1437.28] P:1698.92 E:0.089697 |  There's been a goal at Ibrox.
[1437.28 - 1440.56] P:1917.53 E:0.090654 |  You'll know which way it's gone when you hear the noise behind Gavin Wallace.
[1440.56 - 1442.24] P:1884.11 E:0.105143 |  And what noise would that be, Deno?
[1442.24 - 1444.72] P:1768.00 E:0.091225 |  It is Rangers nil, hearts one.
[1444.72 - 1445.84] P:1800.65 E:0.085927 |  Lawrence Shanklin.
[1445.84 - 1447.60] P:1850.38 E:0.088201 |  Claudio Braga picks it up inside.
[1447.60 - 1448.96] P:1860.19 E:0.087182 |  The Rangers half-darts forward.
[1448.96 - 1451.04] P:1847.43 E:0.077145 |  Shanklin overlaps, goes far side of Butland.
[1451.04 - 1452.48] P:1896.48 E:0.096101 |  It is Rangers nil, hearts one.
[1453.28 - 1456.48] P:1623.21 E:0.096469 |  Certainly not having an easy time of it, Russell Martin.
[1458.32 - 1459.84] P:1760.80 E:0.087192 |  So they are behind again.
[1459.84 - 1463.52] P:1832.69 E:0.088204 |  They've fallen behind a few times already in the early stages up in Scotland.
[1463.52 - 1465.20] P:1796.72 E:0.098921 |  Nil nil it remains here.
[1465.20 - 1467.28] P:1920.92 E:0.104301 |  We're in the 25th minute of this contest.
[1467.28 - 1471.20] P:1818.20 E:0.088546 |  We've got the St. Ledger coming up in probably about 15 minutes time.
[1471.84 - 1474.48] P:1784.77 E:0.079016 |  We're crossing to Doncaster and John Hunt.
[1474.48 - 1477.12] P:1902.29 E:0.097167 |  No other goals elsewhere around the country to tell you about.
[1477.92 - 1482.64] P:1852.47 E:0.078382 |  As Aston Villa with Telemans plays the ball to Cash.
[1483.44 - 1484.88] P:1880.55 E:0.106619 |  Really looks to close him down.
[1484.88 - 1487.20] P:1782.71 E:0.097557 |  Jusbri Hall, Everton working hard off the ball.
[1487.20 - 1488.56] P:1663.84 E:0.094866 |  Even Beto's back there as well.
[1488.56 - 1492.80] P:1881.99 E:0.087722 |  Telemans tries to wriggle clear to Rogers to McGinn on the overlap.
[1492.80 - 1494.00] P:1867.06 E:0.092172 |  Cash, first hand cross.
[1494.00 - 1496.00] P:1914.91 E:0.101150 |  Text of deflection, he's able to clear.
[1496.00 - 1496.64] P:1858.24 E:0.112271 |  It's a late flag.
[1497.36 - 1498.64] P:1798.53 E:0.110982 |  Offside, free kick to Everton.
[1498.64 - 1499.12] P:1658.23 E:0.101661 |  Nil nil.
[1499.12 - 1501.20] P:1716.12 E:0.101470 |  Yeah, best moment of the game for Aston Villa.
[1501.20 - 1502.80] P:1502.98 E:0.091770 |  Quick move in the ball.
[1502.80 - 1503.84] P:2060.80 E:0.093438 |  One and two touch.
[1503.84 - 1505.76] P:1919.64 E:0.091341 |  Shifted Everton's midfield press.
[1505.76 - 1508.32] P:1637.21 E:0.077347 |  Finally, a lot better from them.
[1508.32 - 1512.24] P:1792.65 E:0.108010 |  Just the run was a little bit too early for Matty Cash to go in behind,
[1512.24 - 1513.60] P:1759.39 E:0.107855 |  but it was a great opportunity.
[1514.40 - 1517.52] P:1751.32 E:0.095066 |  Let's get an update from West Brom with Charlie Slater.
[1517.52 - 1518.72] P:1686.58 E:0.101158 |  24 minutes gone.
[1518.72 - 1521.44] P:1665.98 E:0.115345 |  All West Brom all the time, though it is goalless.
[1521.44 - 1523.76] P:1664.37 E:0.107934 |  Their best chance from a Jed Wallace cross.
[1523.76 - 1525.60] P:1565.37 E:0.108712 |  It found Isaac Price on the volley.
[1525.60 - 1527.60] P:1726.70 E:0.112789 |  18 yards out straight at the goalkeeper.
[1527.60 - 1528.08] P:1565.27 E:0.115626 |  Nil nil.
[1528.72 - 1531.76] P:1648.70 E:0.097046 |  Just been checking my notes from the old firm a few weeks ago.
[1531.76 - 1535.28] P:1761.69 E:0.115312 |  Rangers going into that game with their worst start in 42 years.
[1535.92 - 1538.80] P:1804.43 E:0.090575 |  And they are behind to Hartz then at Ibrox,
[1538.80 - 1541.68] P:1774.77 E:0.088441 |  nor the goals elsewhere to tell you about ironic cheers
[1542.40 - 1544.64] P:1816.91 E:0.081993 |  from the Everton supporters.
[1544.64 - 1546.08] P:1897.43 E:0.109907 |  Normally when you get a new stadium,
[1546.08 - 1550.24] P:1838.94 E:0.074022 |  it takes a while for the atmosphere to take hold, doesn't it?
[1550.24 - 1551.52] P:1810.19 E:0.079377 |  I wouldn't say that's the case here.
[1551.52 - 1552.88] P:1369.77 E:0.102879 |  No, it hasn't at all.
[1552.88 - 1553.84] P:1485.46 E:0.076475 |  I think that was one of the things.
[1553.84 - 1556.96] P:1737.25 E:0.092337 |  I think sometimes you wonder where fans will position themselves.
[1556.96 - 1559.76] P:1801.87 E:0.096825 |  There used to be in certain areas within Goodison.
[1559.76 - 1562.80] P:1682.12 E:0.095252 |  And will you get those same people around you that create that atmosphere?
[1563.44 - 1565.36] P:1371.98 E:0.095032 |  There's been no problem at all with that.
[1565.36 - 1569.20] P:1675.58 E:0.092875 |  I just wonder as well whether the safe standing as well helps behind the goal
[1569.20 - 1571.28] P:1631.77 E:0.090971 |  to our right-hand side and the south stand.
[1571.28 - 1575.36] P:1641.47 E:0.090816 |  It certainly seems to be adding a little bit more to the stadium.
[1575.36 - 1577.92] P:1637.29 E:0.104664 |  The voice of Stephen Warnock on BBC Radio 5 Live
[1577.92 - 1579.28] P:1704.54 E:0.106080 |  with the World Service, Nil nil.
[1579.28 - 1580.64] P:1804.85 E:0.102081 |  Fleetwood won Walsall won.
[1580.64 - 1582.72] P:1848.89 E:0.110518 |  So Walsall have gone an equaliser.
[1582.72 - 1586.88] P:1864.75 E:0.097303 |  Chesterfield, Nil, NK Donnes won is the latest score also in League 2.
[1586.88 - 1589.44] P:1769.73 E:0.091504 |  Is it me or is Simon Hooper starting getting whistle happy?
[1590.08 - 1590.96] P:1571.39 E:0.115122 |  Yeah, he has a little bit,
[1590.96 - 1592.80] P:1697.31 E:0.096574 |  but I do think that was the right decision there.
[1592.80 - 1594.96] P:1675.20 E:0.095116 |  He tried to let the game go on a little bit before,
[1595.04 - 1598.56] P:1852.41 E:0.071544 |  but it was one of those incidents where he just clipped.
[1598.56 - 1602.32] P:1805.58 E:0.073073 |  It was better when on Bogart where he just clipped his ankles,
[1602.32 - 1603.28] P:1422.05 E:0.088009 |  brought him to the ground.
[1603.84 - 1605.44] P:1634.96 E:0.079682 |  Everton fans, they don't like it,
[1605.44 - 1606.80] P:1619.28 E:0.099440 |  but it had it being the other way.
[1606.80 - 1608.88] P:1770.75 E:0.064392 |  They would have been furious as well.
[1608.88 - 1610.08] P:1595.72 E:0.097171 |  Back to Newcastle and Mike.
[1610.80 - 1615.20] P:1807.53 E:0.094978 |  Well, Jürson Mosquera has just had a lengthy treatment inside the Walsal penalty area.
[1615.20 - 1617.52] P:1838.72 E:0.100158 |  I think he took a shot from Newcastle's new signing,
[1617.52 - 1619.60] P:1849.21 E:0.095041 |  Nick Volta Marder at full pelt,
[1619.60 - 1620.32] P:1845.33 E:0.110959 |  but he's off the pitch.
[1620.32 - 1621.28] P:1882.85 E:0.129125 |  He'll come back on shortly.
[1621.28 - 1623.84] P:1862.31 E:0.108775 |  Newcastle, Nil. Walsal, 27 minutes play.
[1624.72 - 1626.64] P:1788.40 E:0.101135 |  That commentary is on sports extra.
[1626.64 - 1630.24] P:1759.19 E:0.086787 |  Not for the first time, Aston Villa are trying to play out from the back
[1630.24 - 1633.44] P:1726.86 E:0.087830 |  and are almost getting themselves in a right old mess.
[1634.16 - 1637.68] P:1681.92 E:0.103888 |  Temi Martinez, arguably the most experienced player on the pitch,
[1637.68 - 1640.48] P:1828.46 E:0.087874 |  and he's the one playing short passes into his midfield.
[1640.48 - 1646.96] P:1638.14 E:0.088265 |  And think of all the people that wouldn't want people to receive a ball deep in the penalty area,
[1646.96 - 1648.24] P:1498.31 E:0.109510 |  is one of his own players,
[1648.24 - 1651.44] P:1801.65 E:0.083573 |  and he's just put his team in so much danger.
[1651.44 - 1652.56] P:1650.79 E:0.030360 |  Yeah.
[1652.56 - 1655.20] P:1699.79 E:0.091126 |  Pickford strikes it first time, left footed,
[1655.20 - 1656.72] P:1749.28 E:0.096461 |  and Jai tries to get underneath it.
[1656.72 - 1657.92] P:1693.86 E:0.089842 |  Downward header from Konso.
[1659.04 - 1662.48] P:1778.45 E:0.088075 |  Jewsbury Hall, leaping into that challenge.
[1662.48 - 1665.12] P:1803.85 E:0.070508 |  Cleared then by Matty Cash.
[1665.12 - 1668.80] P:1893.69 E:0.106753 |  Tarkovsky with a high right leg, steps forward,
[1668.80 - 1671.60] P:1788.27 E:0.108280 |  and then Iroboonam's ball out towards O'Brien
[1671.60 - 1674.88] P:1855.16 E:0.088635 |  was just too far ahead of the Everton right back,
[1674.88 - 1675.92] P:1444.98 E:0.088590 |  and it was delivered with pace,
[1675.92 - 1678.08] P:1752.35 E:0.079484 |  and it was actually arcing away from him.
[1678.08 - 1681.04] P:1698.58 E:0.092459 |  And so it went out for an Aston Villa throw on that far side,
[1681.12 - 1684.24] P:1743.02 E:0.085264 |  as weak autumnal sunshine here on Merseyside, 0-0.
[1684.24 - 1688.40] P:1508.88 E:0.099960 |  Yeah, I think he just got caught up with the momentum of the way the game was going then,
[1688.40 - 1691.60] P:1670.80 E:0.079905 |  and the crowd was picking up as Tarkovsky stepped in,
[1691.60 - 1694.24] P:1545.72 E:0.092688 |  and he just needed to compose himself a little bit.
[1694.24 - 1698.64] P:1487.29 E:0.073651 |  But again, Everton, the press in so high,
[1698.64 - 1702.64] P:1585.89 E:0.087429 |  Aston Villa found, and it's so difficult to get any foothold in the game.
[1702.64 - 1706.88] P:1710.32 E:0.092758 |  Now they're trying to slow it down to the speed that we know they like to slow it down to,
[1706.88 - 1710.08] P:1642.89 E:0.084074 |  but the press again from Everton is really positive.
[1710.16 - 1713.84] P:1868.77 E:0.098285 |  Shrewsbury Town, Nils Salford City, 1 is the latest scoring league too.
[1713.84 - 1719.36] P:1768.15 E:0.076974 |  Aston Villa go back, Consa in the shadows of the main stand here,
[1721.20 - 1727.44] P:1755.62 E:0.073336 |  and then Telemans just outside the centre-circle back to Consa, short diagonal ball.
[1727.44 - 1729.76] P:1851.22 E:0.093835 |  Telemans, the Belgian international towards Bwendier,
[1729.76 - 1732.40] P:1824.31 E:0.110314 |  tries to get away with a 2-10, and Gij...
[1734.16 - 1736.16] P:1713.37 E:0.116456 |  I know we're quite high up in a long way, I thought,
[1736.16 - 1739.28] P:1645.84 E:0.099634 |  and Gij with a right foot got the ball to prod it away from Bwendier.
[1739.28 - 1742.64] P:1721.30 E:0.082131 |  Bwendier goes to the ground, and Simon Hooper says it's a free kick.
[1742.64 - 1744.08] P:1692.69 E:0.098377 |  I'll say I thought it was a free kick.
[1744.08 - 1747.60] P:1788.72 E:0.095218 |  I thought Bwendier just nudged it away from Elemen and Gij,
[1747.60 - 1749.92] P:1801.57 E:0.088001 |  did enough just to take it away from him,
[1749.92 - 1754.16] P:1753.09 E:0.084669 |  and that foot that you're talking about from Nij, just sweep the legs of Bwendier.
[1756.48 - 1761.60] P:1783.71 E:0.072576 |  As free kick for Aston Villa, nil nil, Telemans stands over it.
[1763.12 - 1766.88] P:1708.53 E:0.091493 |  They place the ball out towards the far side, Dynia left-hand side,
[1766.88 - 1771.04] P:1815.09 E:0.097359 |  Dynia closed down by Nij, and loses the ball.
[1771.04 - 1773.36] P:1868.78 E:0.113036 |  There's a goal at Newcastle, Mike Minay.
[1773.92 - 1778.80] P:1793.25 E:0.104599 |  £69 million well spent, Nick Volta-Marder scores on his Newcastle debut,
[1778.80 - 1781.20] P:1657.80 E:0.103906 |  a way to the left-hand side, cross-gaming for the right,
[1781.20 - 1783.68] P:1734.70 E:0.096108 |  big header, as you'd expect from the tall striker,
[1783.68 - 1786.72] P:1662.23 E:0.102136 |  and into the left-hand side of the goal, Newcastle 1, Wolves nil.
[1787.52 - 1788.32] P:1518.95 E:0.112393 |  Alexander who?
[1789.20 - 1789.92] P:1548.89 E:0.100307 |  Volta-Marder.
[1790.80 - 1797.20] P:1758.70 E:0.080144 |  They'll certainly be welcome his first goal,
[1797.84 - 1806.32] P:1810.79 E:0.080864 |  and for Isaac, who's not guaranteed necessarily to start that game tomorrow at Burnley,
[1806.32 - 1807.36] P:1917.94 E:0.085084 |  two o'clock kick-off.
[1808.16 - 1813.20] P:1851.81 E:0.085112 |  Certainly Arna Slott was saying that they're going to have to measure his minutes
[1813.20 - 1814.32] P:1889.32 E:0.109265 |  in the early stages.
[1814.32 - 1817.12] P:1836.62 E:0.091996 |  It's not about the next two weeks, it's about the next six years.
[1817.20 - 1818.40] P:1736.92 E:0.105177 |  Comments with that incidentally,
[1818.96 - 1824.48] P:1821.73 E:0.107800 |  Turf Moore will be on five live before the Manchester Dali City United at 4.30.
[1824.48 - 1826.16] P:1799.33 E:0.116763 |  Bristol Rovers 2, Barrow nil.
[1827.52 - 1830.32] P:1727.27 E:0.107733 |  He's becoming disjointed with the referee's decisions.
[1830.32 - 1832.56] P:1756.60 E:0.086766 |  John Bennett watching Crystal Palace Sunderland.
[1832.56 - 1836.88] P:1699.23 E:0.109032 |  It's nil nil, but Yerimipino so close to a perfect home debut for Crystal Palace,
[1836.88 - 1840.48] P:1786.93 E:0.098755 |  his shot just wide, he's just been clattered as well by Ray Nildo,
[1840.48 - 1842.40] P:1851.82 E:0.098754 |  but luckily he's okay after a long stoppage.
[1842.40 - 1843.92] P:1992.12 E:0.102250 |  Crystal Palace nil, Sunderland nil.
[1844.40 - 1848.96] P:1821.68 E:0.095946 |  Grealish just trying to get away from Cash, tight behind him, holding his shirt,
[1848.96 - 1852.80] P:1812.61 E:0.094873 |  clearly pulling the back of that raw blue shirt was the Polish international, Matty Cash.
[1853.36 - 1858.56] P:1841.66 E:0.099080 |  And Irribunam will win a throw for Everton off the legs of Morgan Rodgers,
[1858.56 - 1862.80] P:1859.73 E:0.103447 |  the PFA Young Player of the Year, Harrogate Towner leading at Swindon by Goulton Il Swindon,
[1862.80 - 1865.12] P:1872.40 E:0.089105 |  who won four successive matches in League Two.
[1865.12 - 1868.72] P:1737.92 E:0.091179 |  They were second this morning, Simon Weaver-Side have taken the lead
[1869.76 - 1873.44] P:1614.03 E:0.089946 |  in the Premier League earlier, Arsenal went to the top of the table after that
[1873.44 - 1877.68] P:1652.47 E:0.096610 |  3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, Bournemouthly, Brighton and Hobalbian by Goulton Il,
[1877.68 - 1881.84] P:1842.96 E:0.095308 |  Newcastle are winding up at home to Wolves, Garner with a throw on this near side,
[1882.40 - 1886.80] P:1817.07 E:0.092070 |  and it's flicked on, Keane is there and then it's caught by Martinez.
[1886.80 - 1890.56] P:1700.07 E:0.090103 |  He might have just got one either on the hand or in the ribs there from Keane,
[1890.56 - 1892.16] P:1696.28 E:0.087537 |  I think it actually came off a villa head.
[1892.16 - 1896.16] P:1707.76 E:0.098113 |  Yeah, I think it did, I mean Beto won the first initial flick on and then
[1896.16 - 1900.08] P:1745.83 E:0.097801 |  credit to Emi Martinez, he was the one who was alive to the situation,
[1900.16 - 1904.32] P:1696.03 E:0.102850 |  the ball just lost its momentum but there are danger from long throws, Everton.
[1904.32 - 1907.68] P:1746.75 E:0.107483 |  Here is Anjai running with the ball on his feet making inroads as well,
[1907.68 - 1910.96] P:1801.78 E:0.107877 |  Keane is in support, Keane helps it on its way, here is Grealish,
[1910.96 - 1914.40] P:1855.58 E:0.108763 |  Grealish in towards the penalty area, can he get a decisive goal, he goes that wide
[1914.40 - 1918.00] P:1813.51 E:0.112136 |  and he fires it left footed in low, but it comes off the shins of concert
[1918.00 - 1920.48] P:1779.62 E:0.111982 |  and behind for an Everton corner kick, Niel Niel.
[1920.48 - 1926.00] P:1711.53 E:0.109421 |  Yeah, he's petrified, Batty Cash in a 1v1 situation, he just knew he couldn't dive in on Jack Grealish,
[1926.00 - 1931.60] P:1713.66 E:0.096080 |  Jack Grealish held all the cards in that situation, gets to the byline, tries to get the cross back
[1931.60 - 1934.48] P:1697.57 E:0.079400 |  but good for positional sense from Esri Konza.
[1934.48 - 1938.32] P:1913.40 E:0.099029 |  Grimsby Town, Niel Cambridge United, 1 is the latest score in League 2,
[1939.44 - 1946.72] P:1798.02 E:0.083100 |  as Jusbree Hall on this near side, the Everton left, still goalless here with a corner kick,
[1946.72 - 1952.88] P:1803.29 E:0.095112 |  in it goes now, just over the top, Batty was gone and wasn't it, he was clipped in right footed
[1952.96 - 1955.60] P:1820.87 E:0.103265 |  and it was a teasing ball into that six yard area.
[1955.60 - 1960.32] P:1698.20 E:0.093840 |  Yeah, Michael Keane with the flick has had a great opportunity there to win that header,
[1960.32 - 1964.88] P:1690.82 E:0.090049 |  he comes from behind, Emi Martinez initially makes the run in front of him,
[1964.88 - 1968.72] P:1742.29 E:0.087728 |  then gets in front of Tyrone Mings, a little flick towards the near post,
[1968.72 - 1973.12] P:1687.46 E:0.080862 |  just a little bit too much on it, only needed to glance it, got too much contact,
[1973.12 - 1974.96] P:1636.59 E:0.084563 |  another opportunity for Everton.
[1974.96 - 1979.44] P:1925.06 E:0.088120 |  Dundee Niel Motherwell 1 is the latest score on the Scottish Premiership at Dent's Park,
[1979.44 - 1984.24] P:1789.44 E:0.083241 |  Martinez is able to pick his pass from that goal kick, out to Deenia Falside the left,
[1984.24 - 1988.40] P:1878.31 E:0.103926 |  infield now to Tealum and he gives it away, straight towards Jusbree Hall, forward ball
[1988.40 - 1993.84] P:1779.23 E:0.087809 |  towards Beto on the stretch, couldn't gather it in, cleared away by the Aston Villa defence,
[1993.84 - 1999.44] P:1778.99 E:0.085296 |  only as far as Ghana, here is Keane, back out towards Ghana, down the left hand side,
[1999.44 - 2005.52] P:1801.30 E:0.112697 |  that was late by Cash, catching Greenish, going to get a yellow card, first booking of the game,
[2005.60 - 2008.00] P:1801.06 E:0.093730 |  Matty Cash books, Everton freekid.
[2008.00 - 2013.68] P:1732.20 E:0.096000 |  Yeah, silly from Matty Cash, absolutely brilliant from Jack Greenish, knew exactly what he wanted to do,
[2013.68 - 2019.84] P:1756.11 E:0.084937 |  he just accelerated towards the ball right at the last second, Matty Cash thought he could win the ball,
[2019.84 - 2024.88] P:1855.39 E:0.084691 |  just pinches it round the corner, Cash leaves the 14, now he's booked, now he's in trouble,
[2024.88 - 2031.04] P:1734.00 E:0.081934 |  because every time that the ball goes out into that left hand side, isolate Jack Greenish against Matty Cash,
[2031.04 - 2035.44] P:1723.09 E:0.089523 |  we might see a little bit of a positional change here, because I think Bogart might end up
[2035.44 - 2040.64] P:1749.89 E:0.084925 |  at right back, and Matty Cash might end up at right wing, took McGinnin alongside Tealamans and
[2042.72 - 2046.48] P:1789.22 E:0.085772 |  inside, because getting the run around in the field, Aston Villa.
[2046.48 - 2050.80] P:1868.12 E:0.113138 |  He actually used to play, didn't he, on the wing for Nottingham Forrest,
[2050.80 - 2056.96] P:1900.73 E:0.108978 |  before he was converted into a fallback, as now in the 34th minute of the game here at the Hildickinson
[2056.96 - 2064.08] P:1885.17 E:0.103499 |  Stadium, the Everton supporters rise to their feet in memory of Paul Marion, who sadly has
[2064.08 - 2068.08] P:1865.34 E:0.108121 |  passed away a day after the Brydon Hove-Alvian game at the age of 34,
[2070.08 - 2076.00] P:1885.86 E:0.105263 |  and his picture actually comes on the giant screens at either end of the stadium,
[2076.72 - 2082.64] P:1853.38 E:0.105386 |  and a pause in his memory, and even the Aston Villa supporters are also joining in, nice touch.
[2082.64 - 2088.00] P:1788.87 E:0.108829 |  Yeah, lovely talk, Jeff, sorry it's on a lot of people's social medias, friends that I know
[2088.08 - 2091.20] P:1780.79 E:0.109043 |  who are close with Paul, so very sad day.
[2092.24 - 2096.96] P:1824.90 E:0.102643 |  Well, a lovely gesture by Everton and the Aston Villa fans.
[2098.40 - 2101.84] P:2025.67 E:0.099070 |  Tramir Overs won, Newport County 0 and the championship, Wrexham 0,
[2101.84 - 2107.12] P:1792.72 E:0.089350 |  Queens Park Rangers 1, and in League 1 our featured game, as Aston Villa attacking,
[2107.12 - 2111.12] P:1903.84 E:0.097744 |  Tarkovsky stretches, gets there before Buendia, but he wins it back towards Rodgers,
[2111.12 - 2114.16] P:1894.98 E:0.089973 |  shot comes in, takes the deflection, penalty at stop point, Adam Cotier.
[2115.12 - 2122.24] P:1838.62 E:0.091683 |  Oliver Norwood is lining it up for Stockport here in a push in the penalty area on Oden Bailey,
[2122.24 - 2127.04] P:1880.48 E:0.085577 |  and Cardiff who've only conceded one goal so far this season in League 1,
[2127.04 - 2132.88] P:1798.05 E:0.090147 |  about to face this penalty, Stockport twice close already, and Norwood will step up here
[2132.88 - 2137.12] P:1786.37 E:0.102320 |  with the goalkeeper waiting on his line, and he scores 1-0 to Stockport.
[2137.76 - 2143.68] P:1870.26 E:0.086786 |  So, Stockport County leading Cardiff City who were knocked off their perch at the
[2145.12 - 2149.68] P:1730.20 E:0.086866 |  top of League 1 by Bradford City who beat Huddersfield by 3 goals to 1,
[2149.68 - 2154.88] P:1800.83 E:0.084993 |  the first League meeting between the two in 18 years, and Bradford's impressive start to the season
[2155.52 - 2160.56] P:1750.89 E:0.084336 |  continues. Northampton beat Blackpool by a goal to nil in the early game in League 1,
[2160.56 - 2164.72] P:1869.59 E:0.079411 |  and the early fixtures in League 2, Ackrington got their first win of the season, 1-0 winners
[2164.72 - 2168.72] P:1956.39 E:0.092959 |  against Colchester, Crawley 2, Cheltenham nil, and the three results in the championship,
[2168.72 - 2174.64] P:1859.21 E:0.088929 |  Chelten 1, Millwall 1, Oxford 2, Leicester 2, Preston 2, Middlesbrough 2. Let's get the betting
[2174.64 - 2179.12] P:1803.17 E:0.087179 |  then for the St. Laidge, John Hunt. And very tight indeed at the top of the market Ian,
[2179.12 - 2184.08] P:1761.20 E:0.089407 |  between Scandinavia and Lamborn, Scandinavia just favourites in around 5-2,
[2184.08 - 2190.88] P:1659.13 E:0.090026 |  Carmas is a 4-1 chance, it's a big threat to the Mall I reckon, stay true 8-1, and Raheeb 14-1
[2190.88 - 2196.96] P:1769.74 E:0.085795 |  with Tarrians and further both 20-1, but as they arrive at the post in the Doncaster sunshine,
[2196.96 - 2203.52] P:1733.42 E:0.084509 |  Scandinavia just favoured ahead of Lamborn and Carmas. Thank you John, we'll be with you very,
[2203.52 - 2208.16] P:1786.33 E:0.100176 |  very soon, Reading of equalised at Oakwell in League 1, Barnsley 1, Reading 1, no other goals to
[2208.16 - 2214.00] P:1777.66 E:0.079525 |  tell you, oh in fact a part of another one at Hillsborough for Betty Glover. And it's gone Bristol
[2214.00 - 2218.24] P:1758.57 E:0.082223 |  City's way once again, Wednesday just had a good spell of pressure but Bristol City on the counter
[2218.72 - 2222.72] P:1690.89 E:0.084570 |  have another Mametti again, some terrible defending, Wednesday couldn't clear it,
[2222.72 - 2225.76] P:1608.35 E:0.068124 |  Mametti slaughtered it home, Sheppard Wednesday nil, Bristol City 3.
[2226.32 - 2230.72] P:1872.86 E:0.108069 |  So coverage of the St. Ledger is two or three minutes away, this is BBC Radio 5 live and the
[2230.72 - 2236.00] P:1809.86 E:0.098820 |  World Service in the sunshine now down by the Docks where it is Everton nil, Aston Villa nil,
[2236.72 - 2241.84] P:1778.36 E:0.093893 |  in Beto putting Ming's under pressure, Ming's goes down the line, interception though from
[2241.84 - 2246.48] P:1759.64 E:0.091146 |  Anjai before Dina, hemmed in towards the corner flag in front of the Aston Villa, supporters
[2246.56 - 2250.72] P:1815.94 E:0.089716 |  is Anjai tries to roll away from his man and then they've actually doubled up on him and
[2250.72 - 2255.12] P:1855.20 E:0.097258 |  Bwendiah's intervention was crucial for Villa but still they can't get out of their own box,
[2255.12 - 2260.88] P:1775.03 E:0.091062 |  Bwendiah keeps the ball in play, Rodgers comes back to help out, he heads it now towards Bogard
[2260.88 - 2266.16] P:1818.95 E:0.102101 |  but Everton oppressing, gay, ratting around in the midfield, there's a foul in there and it'll be
[2266.16 - 2271.60] P:1769.31 E:0.092692 |  Anaston Villa free kick midway through the road half, Everton works so hard off the ball. Yeah they
[2271.60 - 2275.76] P:1704.12 E:0.093364 |  do and that's that athleticism that I talked about before now they can get around the pitch and it's
[2275.76 - 2281.28] P:1673.14 E:0.080985 |  something that will take time to see more consistently from Everton but here comes Aston Villa.
[2281.28 - 2286.96] P:1838.15 E:0.085613 |  Watkins to McGinn, he tees up Tealemans, no whip on that left hand side, he went to pass it that way
[2286.96 - 2291.44] P:1940.94 E:0.100076 |  instead they go towards the right, cash with the cross, blocked by a sliding Ghana, he started
[2291.44 - 2295.76] P:1806.09 E:0.088125 |  the season in superb fashion as James Ghana whether it be at left back or in midfield.
[2295.76 - 2299.60] P:1869.41 E:0.090738 |  Here now is Tealemans, Dina has made the run and Tealemans has spotted him,
[2299.60 - 2306.08] P:1816.14 E:0.091145 |  oh and then Brian Dutton underneath it and I think Dina would actually stop going after the ball.
[2306.72 - 2311.68] P:1769.19 E:0.087746 |  It's the gamble you take as a fullback and you think are they going to gamble on you winning
[2311.68 - 2315.68] P:1713.60 E:0.090097 |  the first head-driver and maybe see where the ball's going to drop because you're back pedaling
[2315.68 - 2319.84] P:1699.05 E:0.087370 |  you're not really going to get much distance on the header and that's exactly what Luca Dina did.
[2320.72 - 2323.52] P:1702.24 E:0.099272 |  Bit of a gamble from Jacob O'Brien but it paid off this time.
[2323.52 - 2325.76] P:1886.10 E:0.085600 |  How is the mood at Eyebrocks Gavin Wallace?
[2325.84 - 2329.92] P:2021.39 E:0.090858 |  It's changed a little bit because Steyl O'Askard has just smacked one off the cross but albeit
[2329.92 - 2333.52] P:1932.45 E:0.084514 |  they go to the German goalkeeper just touched it on, still one nil to Hearts at the moment
[2333.52 - 2335.04] P:1924.28 E:0.083620 |  but Rangers coming back into it then.
[2335.76 - 2339.44] P:1672.31 E:0.095861 |  He got a hat trick didn't he in midweek in that thumping of Moldova for Norway,
[2340.16 - 2346.24] P:1915.34 E:0.099735 |  couldn't quite match the haul of Erling Harland as Gay wins the challenge that 50-50 in the midfield,
[2346.24 - 2350.56] P:1833.32 E:0.100446 |  Wimbledon nil, Rotherham 1 is the latest scorer in league 1 and Jai slows it down
[2350.56 - 2354.88] P:1878.48 E:0.105430 |  and then looks to accelerate then goes on the outside of Dina and he's left Dina for dad and
[2354.88 - 2359.28] P:1851.98 E:0.093970 |  Jai now sends over the cross from the right hand side collected by Grealish, left hand side of the
[2359.28 - 2363.52] P:1877.28 E:0.082035 |  penalty area six yards up Grealish shoots, blocks, spins out to the edge of the area,
[2363.52 - 2367.92] P:1829.39 E:0.084489 |  stabbed forward by Rogers, laid off by Watkins, Bogard now in towards McGinn,
[2367.92 - 2374.40] P:1852.29 E:0.086694 |  Rogers and Watkins going on ahead of him, instead it's a floated ball played very well by McGinn
[2374.40 - 2379.84] P:1780.94 E:0.081939 |  and he looked for Brundia and now Dina is joining the attack and here is the former
[2379.92 - 2385.04] P:1886.41 E:0.092323 |  Everton defender in field towards Telemans back towards Brundia they're now in the penalty
[2385.04 - 2390.80] P:1936.42 E:0.090194 |  area Aston Villa and the cross is gathered in by Pickford, Chancellor Bournemouth to Hellside.
[2390.80 - 2395.04] P:1852.68 E:0.089126 |  Still Bournemouth 1, Brighton nil, five minutes to play in the first half Ian but a chance for
[2395.04 - 2399.60] P:1881.78 E:0.081076 |  Brighton and Jan Kubenminter racing down the right hand side he fired in the shot towards the
[2399.60 - 2405.84] P:1933.64 E:0.077489 |  near post it was neatly turned away by the Bournemouth goalkeeper Petrovic, Bournemouth 1, Brighton nil.
[2405.84 - 2409.44] P:1792.35 E:0.091643 |  Bit more even now isn't it? Yeah they're coming back into it Aston Villa it's just getting a
[2409.44 - 2414.40] P:1686.43 E:0.083787 |  little bit more of a basketball game if you like bit end to end but the one thing I'd say
[2414.40 - 2419.52] P:1653.15 E:0.089128 |  Dano I would pay money to watch Ilumine and Jai he's a superb footballer you think of the money
[2419.52 - 2425.36] P:1699.15 E:0.084219 |  they pay for him it's around about £15 million wasn't it from Marseille in today's money that
[2425.36 - 2433.20] P:1879.91 E:0.072242 |  is an incredible bit of business. Yeah it was a five-year deal too but he is a joy to watch
[2433.20 - 2437.52] P:1757.49 E:0.081195 |  since Aston Villa got promoted back to the top flight in 2019 they're actually unbeaten
[2438.08 - 2443.20] P:1801.41 E:0.077397 |  in 12 league meetings against Everton they've won nine they've drawn three so in that sense they
[2443.20 - 2449.92] P:1921.26 E:0.079134 |  might be the perfect opposition to get their first goal of the season as Rodgers will win a corner
[2449.92 - 2454.24] P:1964.14 E:0.091410 |  off the legs of King King was just drawn out of defense Aston Villa corner kick on this near
[2454.24 - 2457.52] P:1623.49 E:0.085970 |  side the right four minutes to go to the break. Yeah they have to be so careful Everton because
[2457.52 - 2463.68] P:1632.04 E:0.091929 |  what we do know about Aston Villa is in forward areas Olly Watkins Morgan Rodgers Buendia they are
[2463.68 - 2468.40] P:1681.94 E:0.083767 |  they've got creative players and they've got players that can just turn the game on its head
[2468.40 - 2473.20] P:1785.97 E:0.089808 |  in a moment and that's whatever it's in a fearful of. We've got a quick goal update from Owen Gwyneth at Swansea.
[2474.32 - 2478.64] P:1962.16 E:0.097190 |  Yeah it's been a bit of a footballing game so far but Swansea ahead Swansea one hell 15-0

[2488.24 - 2492.40] P:1903.12 E:0.093521 |  Swansea are unbeaten at home so far this season Peter Brattu Wicom 0.
[2493.68 - 2497.92] P:1935.07 E:0.096377 |  Peter Brattu then have got a second goal as they look for their first win of the season Aston
[2497.92 - 2502.32] P:1839.81 E:0.095012 |  Villa taking the time with the corner kick we're going racing for the St. Ledger very very soon.

[2517.52 - 2520.96] P:1709.29 E:0.102145 |  opposite number Jordan Pickford. I just never understand that you've got an outfield player
[2520.96 - 2526.40] P:1719.52 E:0.088967 |  in front of you who's five yards away and you think you can ping a better ball as a goalkeeper
[2526.40 - 2530.16] P:1744.88 E:0.085239 |  that's why you're a goalkeeper because you don't have the ability to hit the same passes
[2530.16 - 2534.08] P:1806.09 E:0.085669 |  that's someone that just baffles me. We're going racing it's the St. Ledger John Hunt.

[2718.08 - 2724.00] P:1755.23 E:0.086165 |  dangerous position and one thing you'll know is is Luca D'Agnul edges way across it's Morgan

[2756.24 - 2761.60] P:1875.31 E:0.070078 |  out from goal Aston Villa playing from left to right you've got Dina the referee's just
[2761.60 - 2766.80] P:1791.73 E:0.080504 |  backed into Luca D'Agnul almost stood on these toes Morgan Rogers is there
[2767.76 - 2771.04] P:1684.45 E:0.097707 |  you've got to be careful doing that if you remember Bruno that knocked him out of sink
[2771.04 - 2776.80] P:1747.52 E:0.085209 |  and moaned and blamed everyone for his poor penalty didn't he it certainly did

[2787.28 - 2795.20] P:1882.57 E:0.083353 |  it is D'Agnul into the wall so Ohan Gwyneth at Swansea Swansea one hell city one against
[2795.28 - 2800.56] P:1810.22 E:0.089948 |  it under play slightly former Swansea hero only McBurney where the equalizer ball played in from
[2800.56 - 2806.08] P:1823.94 E:0.075779 |  the left hand side he slides in the six yard box to poke it in and McBurney strike gets up doesn't
[2806.08 - 2812.16] P:1794.75 E:0.069993 |  celebrate but it says Swansea one hell city one Aston Villa with a throw far side the left
[2812.16 - 2818.56] P:1861.64 E:0.085689 |  in towards mings at the near post and the referee's blown his whistle and that will be a free kick
[2818.56 - 2823.36] P:1670.87 E:0.105852 |  to no I think it's a foul throw you know no yeah I think he's saying he stepped onto the pitch yeah
[2824.32 - 2828.96] P:1486.84 E:0.085803 |  and he's picked up a lot of minor things but obviously if it's a foul throw it's a foul throw
[2829.68 - 2833.60] P:1747.97 E:0.068846 |  that's the second foul throw from Aston Villa in this half both from the full box as well
[2834.40 - 2840.96] P:1708.36 E:0.077027 |  nothing wrong with full backs having a pop I know no Stephen Warner 101 appearances and three goals
[2840.96 - 2848.00] P:1933.82 E:0.080080 |  during your time at Aston Villa yeah not prolific for my England international two is the halftime
[2848.00 - 2852.80] P:1866.12 E:0.100116 |  whistle sounds how would you sum up that first half I thought it was brilliant at the start from
[2852.80 - 2858.72] P:1541.71 E:0.088031 |  Everton the first 20 minutes I thought there was just a wave of attack from Everton the pressure
[2858.72 - 2862.80] P:1614.71 E:0.095958 |  that they were putting on Aston Villa to try and find or to make sure that they couldn't play up
[2862.80 - 2866.32] P:1473.01 E:0.094337 |  from the back but credit to Aston Villa they stayed within the game they've managed to get
[2866.32 - 2871.28] P:1750.84 E:0.085365 |  themselves back into it created a couple of opportunities nothing of real no but they've
[2871.28 - 2875.28] P:1796.85 E:0.086678 |  sort of made Everton step back a little bit and that's what you've got to do you've got to stay
[2875.28 - 2879.36] P:1719.58 E:0.084103 |  in the game when you're away from home but things can only get better from Aston Villa's point of
[2879.36 - 2884.72] P:1862.30 E:0.080454 |  view but David Moyes will be very pleased with what he's seen so halftime then here at the Hill
[2884.72 - 2890.56] P:1790.68 E:0.080023 |  Dickinson Stadium it is Everton nil Aston Villa nil halftime at Craven Cottage as well and it's the

[3712.32 - 3717.04] P:1366.17 E:0.108674 |  terrific a real threat with their own qualities so different in the way that they create danger
[3717.12 - 3721.04] P:1320.06 E:0.099748 |  threat and unpredictability to the opponent but very pleased it will require different
[3721.04 - 3725.52] P:1422.87 E:0.090878 |  profiles around them as well to maximize the qualities as they have but they are both in
[3725.52 - 3730.16] P:1628.58 E:0.096093 |  in a good moment your players all over the pitch you sparkle for you and the man with two goals the
[3730.16 - 3734.48] P:1456.32 E:0.090462 |  first one was a thunderbolt the second one was a header from Zuber Mendy incredible nothing to be
[3735.04 - 3739.76] P:1530.98 E:0.082519 |  the way he's performing the authority is showing on the pitch great if he's adding goals on top of
[3739.76 - 3744.96] P:1192.95 E:0.100671 |  that and the type of goal that he scored today then yeah what else can we ask and at the back you
[3744.96 - 3750.72] P:1840.17 E:0.086571 |  were without Saliba but it was seamless there was you wouldn't you wouldn't have noticed he wasn't there
[3750.72 - 3756.00] P:1454.23 E:0.076172 |  yeah I think Mosque again I think we have to throw him at Anfield after five minutes or three minutes
[3756.00 - 3760.56] P:1632.53 E:0.099333 |  I don't know when he was and he had an unbelievable performance and today again it was really solid
[3760.56 - 3765.12] P:1294.92 E:0.097955 |  very convinced again very connected with the defensive line very impressive so good all
[3765.12 - 3771.60] P:1824.14 E:0.083151 |  around at this moment in time everything looking strong for you it is we had the injury of Martin
[3771.60 - 3776.56] P:1312.44 E:0.078549 |  that we don't really know where what happens it looks like the same area of the previous injury so
[3776.56 - 3781.84] P:1590.74 E:0.098252 |  the rest good obviously we lost willow we have still a few plays obviously and feet and they are not
[3781.84 - 3788.08] P:1694.84 E:0.075813 |  available for selection but overall okay. Micaela Teta with Jonathan Pears the thoughts of Ange
[3788.08 - 3794.24] P:1843.60 E:0.078006 |  Poster Coggely during sports report at final clock about five o'clock before full commentary from the
[3794.24 - 3801.20] P:1727.81 E:0.071249 |  London Stadium of West Ham against Tottenham back and away as you can hear at Everton Ian Dennis
[3801.20 - 3806.00] P:1801.62 E:0.087475 |  yes just back and away so perfect timing it is nil nil between Everton and Aston Villa but I can
[3806.00 - 3811.60] P:1838.31 E:0.092989 |  tell you that Aston Villa have made a change at half time Euryd Telemans has gone off and Evan
[3811.60 - 3818.88] P:1853.99 E:0.087685 |  Gessin has come on the Ivory Coast international for just his third appearance as Everton playing
[3818.88 - 3824.32] P:1821.27 E:0.084126 |  from left to right as we look within Jai lays it off towards O'Brien they have picked for the goal
[3824.32 - 3831.12] P:1883.89 E:0.081870 |  O'Brien Keen Tarkovsky Garner at left back Gay Eribunam, Jusbree Hall and Jai Grealish and Beto
[3831.12 - 3834.56] P:1908.33 E:0.083264 |  for Everton in their royal blue shirts and white shorts so they are attacking that
[3835.20 - 3840.96] P:1832.07 E:0.090359 |  giant stand away towards our right that holds the 13,000 all the way back trying to mirror what
[3840.96 - 3844.64] P:1624.06 E:0.090673 |  they've done at Dortmund of course with the yellow wall and very similar as well to those who've been
[3844.64 - 3849.04] P:1771.15 E:0.088269 |  at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium too in comes the throw from O'Brien it was a long one in towards the
[3849.04 - 3856.56] P:1869.27 E:0.069995 |  penalty area and just looking to see how Aston Villa have jigged things around Gessin is playing
[3856.88 - 3860.96] P:1652.07 E:0.095430 |  on the right isn't he? Yeah and then McGinn's gone alongside Bogard in midfield so it's not much of
[3860.96 - 3866.56] P:1771.27 E:0.083859 |  a huge change for them, point here out on this left hand side but what it will do now is I think
[3866.56 - 3872.40] P:1772.51 E:0.083497 |  they'll just be looking to push James Garner back into that left back position with Gessin
[3872.40 - 3877.60] P:1656.10 E:0.092199 |  and his ability to take people on in 1v1 situations but we have seen him predominantly off the left
[3877.60 - 3882.00] P:1746.70 E:0.085011 |  hand side when he started and played for Aston Villa so far. So that's how the midfield is
[3882.00 - 3887.92] P:1853.36 E:0.091990 |  configured with Rodgers in behind Watkins and then the defence is Cash, Mings, Konsa and Dina.
[3887.92 - 3893.76] P:1802.08 E:0.097042 |  Emi Martinez is in goal but Everton are coming forward and this is gay. Can't switch it with
[3893.76 - 3900.00] P:1830.90 E:0.093749 |  to Grealish, struck the heels of McGinn, picked back up though by Everton, Jewsbury Hall falls over,
[3900.00 - 3905.68] P:1793.64 E:0.094547 |  over running the midfield and Rodgers now looks for Watkins easily cut out though by Tarkovsky.
[3905.68 - 3910.80] P:1779.40 E:0.101935 |  Hardly had to really break Stride there to step forward. O'Brien now runs forward with the ball,
[3910.80 - 3915.76] P:1860.24 E:0.095957 |  the right back playing from left to right as well, Irregulant, former Villa player,
[3915.76 - 3920.56] P:1893.33 E:0.092972 |  Jewsbury have equalised at home to Salford City in League 2, Jewsbury 1, Salford City 1,
[3920.56 - 3926.72] P:1800.65 E:0.068956 |  out to Grealish, hugging that left touch line comes infield, they're doled up on him, flicks it back,
[3927.28 - 3935.92] P:1879.05 E:0.098597 |  shot from Garner, Beto, stays it wide. It was a low ball fist in, Beto tried to guide it in right
[3935.92 - 3942.64] P:1789.68 E:0.085353 |  footed and it was probably about a foot or so wide of the right hand post, it remains 0-0,
[3942.64 - 3947.76] P:1827.77 E:0.090204 |  trying the women's rugby union World Cup. Canada, Australia, Masferuki. Yeah, pretty much from
[3947.76 - 3951.84] P:1811.18 E:0.090410 |  kickoff, good link up play down the left from Canada and then a burst of speed from Asia,
[3951.84 - 3956.80] P:1737.88 E:0.087747 |  Hogan, Rochester touching down on the corner. The conversion was missed by Sophie de Goody but Canada
[3956.80 - 3962.32] P:1809.25 E:0.085528 |  starting this match as they mean to go on in this rugby World Cup quarter final, Canada 5, Australia 0.
[3962.32 - 3967.12] P:1928.95 E:0.093701 |  Thanks, Mas, you'll get that on Sports Extra 2, it's a streaming service available through the BBC
[3967.12 - 3971.68] P:1830.58 E:0.094106 |  Sounds app, as we mentioned in the first half, more choice than ever before through the BBC Sounds
[3971.68 - 3976.32] P:1883.09 E:0.084867 |  app, Watford-Neal Blackbird Rovers 1 is the latest score in the championship and Everton,
[3976.32 - 3981.44] P:1889.35 E:0.081664 |  starting the second half as they started the first but are still looking to try and break the deadlock
[3981.44 - 3987.28] P:1817.52 E:0.068829 |  here. On that left hand side, Garner tries to thread it through towards Jewsbury Hall,
[3988.24 - 3994.96] P:1874.75 E:0.062762 |  comes back to Irribunam, ball inside is towards Gay, six yards forward of the centre circle,
[3994.96 - 3999.84] P:1826.66 E:0.083705 |  now it's with Anjai, challenged and dispossessed, breaks up towards Watkins. Watkins has got to
[3999.84 - 4003.52] P:1806.88 E:0.101877 |  go it alone, we've hardly mentioned the England striker but as he looked for a ball there from
[4003.52 - 4008.48] P:1839.22 E:0.101289 |  Rodgers, it was easily dealt with by Keane. Yeah, he's been poor today, Morgan Rodgers, such an
[4008.48 - 4013.12] P:1683.77 E:0.104079 |  important player for Aston Miller and shine for England as well on the international break but
[4013.12 - 4018.16] P:1863.14 E:0.103333 |  he struggled. Grealish hasn't, Grealish coming forward, links up with Jewsbury Hall and then in
[4018.16 - 4022.16] P:1827.08 E:0.108739 |  many ways they were probably guilty of overplaying Everton, the ball then was just
[4022.72 - 4026.40] P:1881.59 E:0.104788 |  chipped back in by Grealish and he thinking have a shot at goal, goes out for a goal kick.
[4026.40 - 4031.28] P:1705.41 E:0.095895 |  Yeah, it was absolutely perfect as he came in off that left hand side, Jack Grealish, he fed it
[4031.28 - 4036.00] P:1762.41 E:0.096230 |  into Jewsbury Hall, little layoff and he should have struck it with the laces or tried to bend it
[4036.00 - 4042.00] P:1735.01 E:0.087080 |  into the far corner, great opportunity for Jack Grealish but I've got to go back to the Beto
[4042.00 - 4047.92] P:1737.09 E:0.086553 |  incident before, Deno, he should score, he should have scored two today, Beto, that's the issue that
[4047.92 - 4053.60] P:1606.29 E:0.088963 |  he has in front of goal, he just doesn't have that quality, the runs in behind, the work rate,
[4053.60 - 4059.36] P:1788.17 E:0.081491 |  you cannot fault him for, just that composure in front of goal has to be better. Yeah, his record
[4059.36 - 4067.52] P:1887.59 E:0.088172 |  is 17 goals in 75 appearances before today, 10 goals last season but it could easily have
[4067.52 - 4071.60] P:1820.97 E:0.097819 |  added and made it three in three and he'd taken a couple of chances so far here today,
[4071.68 - 4074.88] P:1773.95 E:0.093678 |  meanwhile, Buendir runs forward at the heart of the Everton defence shoot, it's actually a
[4074.88 - 4078.56] P:1779.96 E:0.100950 |  reflection and looks why that could have gone anywhere, instead it's gone behind for a corner
[4078.56 - 4082.80] P:1832.58 E:0.096311 |  kick, there's been a goal at Bournemouth, Sahel Sahi. Equaliser, it's Bournemouth one, Brighton
[4082.80 - 4087.44] P:1781.10 E:0.088363 |  one, very simple, minter with a cross from the right hand side and Metoma with a free header
[4087.44 - 4092.80] P:1789.92 E:0.084349 |  at the far post, it's being checked but it's still at this moment, Bournemouth one, Brighton one.
[4093.68 - 4097.04] P:1897.21 E:0.101396 |  Thank you Sahel, Dundir equalised at home to Motherwell in the Scottish Premier
[4097.68 - 4101.52] P:1866.15 E:0.093919 |  Wigan three, Don Castor-Roberts, Neil, you're up today, you can hear the Villas supporters
[4102.48 - 4106.72] P:1750.52 E:0.089436 |  bathing in the sunshine in that bottom quadrant on that far left corner,
[4107.52 - 4113.12] P:1876.05 E:0.071404 |  five minutes played in the second half, so Cash has come across to this near side,
[4113.12 - 4118.96] P:1858.07 E:0.069761 |  this will be an in-swinger, a number of Everton supporters in this steep main stand,
[4118.96 - 4123.92] P:1807.29 E:0.082752 |  still making their way back to their seats after the halftime hospitality, Cash to take it in
[4123.92 - 4128.00] P:1836.18 E:0.100420 |  towards the near post, flicked on towards the far post and then volleyed away to safety
[4128.96 - 4133.84] P:1882.71 E:0.102519 |  by O'Brien, Jillingham lead, Knotts County by a goal to Neil, that's Jillingham who are still
[4133.84 - 4138.88] P:1795.01 E:0.073505 |  unbeaten, leading Knotts County with second place swindon, the last we heard trailing
[4138.88 - 4143.20] P:1817.60 E:0.087947 |  against Harrogate they could extend their lead at the top of the table, we're bringing news of
[4143.20 - 4146.80] P:1705.63 E:0.097216 |  that goal, meanwhile in the meantime we're going to sell her as Park and John Bennett.
[4146.80 - 4151.28] P:1838.24 E:0.108297 |  Crystal Palace, Neil Sunderland, Neil the game is opening up, double chance for Palaeus, it was
[4151.28 - 4156.64] P:1853.91 E:0.100263 |  Mateta who forced to save and then following up, Pino shot was deflected over, Crystal Palace,
[4156.64 - 4162.48] P:1851.40 E:0.088381 |  Neil Sunderland, Neil. Everton, Neil Aston Villa, Neil Aston Villa on this near side the left,
[4162.48 - 4167.60] P:1750.77 E:0.083476 |  Deena and he is going to go back as we will get news of that goal at Priestfield, Mike Williams.
[4167.60 - 4172.32] P:1894.17 E:0.099771 |  Jillingham won, Knotts County, Neil the lead two leaders taking just 50 seconds in this second
[4172.32 - 4177.04] P:1836.16 E:0.097730 |  half to head themselves in front, lovely cushion header from the Jillingham number nine, Josh Andrews
[4177.04 - 4181.28] P:1862.86 E:0.093401 |  making it Jillingham one, Knotts County, Neil. Wiccan Wancers have got a goal back at London road,
[4181.28 - 4185.84] P:1842.11 E:0.104163 |  Peter Brattu Wiccan one is in league one and also in league one Wimbledon one rather a united one,
[4185.84 - 4190.40] P:1807.23 E:0.095645 |  Aston Villa are attacking, Rogers 30 yards out from goal, out to Deena on the left hand side,
[4190.40 - 4195.36] P:1854.56 E:0.100823 |  this near side and it comes, Keen with a flying header, Jusbree Hall almost gives it away to
[4195.36 - 4203.92] P:1820.34 E:0.095924 |  get that inside his own penalty area and in the end it was clear but that was a slight bit of
[4203.92 - 4208.64] P:1684.31 E:0.097652 |  concern for Everton in that back line. Yeah it was brilliant play from Aston Villa, they got
[4208.64 - 4213.84] P:1761.08 E:0.092346 |  forced back towards their own penalty area, the ball ended up back in Martyn as his feet but just
[4213.84 - 4219.60] P:1647.29 E:0.098068 |  three passes later and they're in a penalty area of Everton such as the free-flowing move from
[4219.60 - 4225.36] P:1727.01 E:0.082152 |  Aston Villa starting to just find the rhythm Aston Villa here. Only the second time in the club's
[4225.36 - 4231.76] P:1808.44 E:0.092613 |  history that they have failed to score in their first three league games, 97-98 was the last time,
[4231.76 - 4236.64] P:1780.24 E:0.091214 |  they did actually score in the fourth game but they lost 3-2 at White Heart Lane that day
[4237.20 - 4244.48] P:1685.93 E:0.084185 |  as they lost their opening four under Brian Little, 0-0 and still waiting to get their account
[4245.36 - 4250.00] P:1719.16 E:0.100432 |  up and running for this season, 0-0 it remains, Fulham Leeds United, Aaron Paul.
[4250.00 - 4256.96] P:1600.34 E:0.109252 |  0-0 leads with another cracking opportunity, stack in towards Aronson who just deflected it towards
[4256.96 - 4262.48] P:1717.76 E:0.104390 |  Skog, really good save by Burnlena from close range, torrential downpour here at the cottage to the
[4262.48 - 4267.44] P:1714.33 E:0.103443 |  point in where you know we're sat in a stand which is 150 or so years old, we're actually losing
[4267.44 - 4274.24] P:1618.44 E:0.103059 |  all forms of replays and video assistance here, 0-0. We've got bright sunshine here on Merseyside,
[4275.20 - 4279.68] P:1709.78 E:0.083137 |  tell you what Stephen, that hospitality must be good, we are eight minutes into the second half
[4279.68 - 4283.76] P:1815.48 E:0.087952 |  and still the Everton supporters in front of us are coming back to their seats.
[4283.76 - 4287.60] P:1770.66 E:0.113616 |  You thinking about food and drink again? No, here is Rogers looking to turn
[4287.60 - 4290.24] P:1813.17 E:0.095584 |  into Watkins with his back to goal, lays it off towards Bwendir,
[4291.12 - 4294.48] P:1818.84 E:0.102621 |  Deanie provides the whip on this near side of the left and it requires Arkofsky
[4294.48 - 4299.28] P:1828.73 E:0.100065 |  to stretch inside his six yard area and stretch, he did behind it goes for a corner kick, 0-0.
[4299.28 - 4304.24] P:1673.93 E:0.089918 |  Yeah, you can hear the Aston Villa fans away to our far side, they're looking now
[4304.96 - 4309.12] P:1600.60 E:0.104193 |  like the better team, Aston Villa, they're the ones that are creating more opportunities,
[4309.12 - 4312.48] P:1741.53 E:0.103114 |  they're now getting Luka Deanie higher up the pitch, they're getting the wingers,
[4312.48 - 4317.84] P:1701.84 E:0.091152 |  wingers a little bit more narrow, they're causing the Everton defenders problems,
[4317.84 - 4320.56] P:1595.34 E:0.086181 |  it's been better from Aston Villa so far in the second half.
[4320.56 - 4324.64] P:1770.93 E:0.087411 |  Lutentown have got an equaliser at Kenilworth Road, Lutentown two, Plymouth Argyle two is
[4324.64 - 4329.12] P:1876.26 E:0.088410 |  the latest score in League One, so another corner kick for Aston Villa,
[4331.44 - 4336.48] P:1857.59 E:0.094407 |  and here the travelling support, as Cash waits, right armour loft,
[4337.44 - 4342.40] P:1777.86 E:0.094667 |  Clips it in now towards the near post, Mings was in there, Everton partially get the ball away,
[4342.40 - 4346.56] P:1932.51 E:0.096182 |  only as far as Deanie floats it forward with the outside of his left boot,
[4347.20 - 4352.16] P:1890.66 E:0.097915 |  and claimed by Jordan Pickford, crew lead Barnett by Goulton Hill in League Two,
[4352.16 - 4354.80] P:1739.04 E:0.088642 |  we'll get an update from St James' Park, Mike Minay.
[4354.80 - 4358.48] P:1805.91 E:0.101001 |  Newcastle One-Walls-Nil played six minutes to the second half, the home side dominant from
[4358.48 - 4362.24] P:1829.08 E:0.098655 |  the restart, a lot being played in the walls half, but no real test on Sam Johnston yet,
[4362.32 - 4363.44] P:1681.83 E:0.085658 |  Newcastle One-Walls-Nil.
[4364.00 - 4369.36] P:1980.04 E:0.099331 |  Commentary of that continues on Sports Extra, it might be two-two between Lutentown and Plymouth,
[4369.36 - 4375.44] P:1860.61 E:0.089189 |  but Joe Edwards has been sent off, so Plymouth are now down to 10 men, it remains goalless,
[4375.44 - 4379.68] P:1849.96 E:0.094385 |  10 minutes into the second half, what have you made of these opening exchanges since the restart?
[4379.68 - 4383.28] P:1628.93 E:0.098635 |  Well I think the changing personnel has definitely helped Aston Villa, I think
[4383.28 - 4388.16] P:1657.31 E:0.089572 |  McGinn's looked better in that central area, I think he's helped dominate the game for Aston Villa
[4388.16 - 4392.72] P:1688.68 E:0.092311 |  so far, Leucadena's been able to get higher up on that left hand side, but the energy levels
[4392.72 - 4396.56] P:1543.39 E:0.095387 |  haven't quite been the same from Everton, Nacom Villa again down the left hand side.
[4396.56 - 4402.16] P:1830.51 E:0.092900 |  Bogard just didn't have the weight of the pass to reach, but he's getting forward at every
[4402.16 - 4407.52] P:1820.18 E:0.088666 |  opportunity on this near side, the throw is taken quickly to Wendier, Wendier does a little step
[4407.52 - 4412.56] P:1742.26 E:0.097380 |  over, passes the ball to Bogard and marked outside the area, he brings Cash into play,
[4412.56 - 4417.04] P:1889.34 E:0.081497 |  Cash on the edge of the box, pushes the ball out wide, Gessin now with a cross,
[4417.04 - 4421.28] P:1777.68 E:0.098014 |  gathered in by Pickford, so we will go to West Brom, Charlie Slater.
[4421.28 - 4424.64] P:1709.87 E:0.110414 |  Tang on in the second half, West Brom, Neil Darby, Neil, don't know how though,
[4424.64 - 4429.20] P:1635.40 E:0.107305 |  West Brom should be in front, Campbell's header was cleared off the line by his own team mate,
[4429.20 - 4432.88] P:1633.70 E:0.105298 |  Mowit just couldn't get out of the way, frantic start to the second half, Nil-Nil.
[4433.44 - 4439.04] P:1897.09 E:0.106403 |  Barnsley lead Reading by two goals to honour Oakwell in League One, the results earlier today,
[4439.04 - 4442.96] P:1745.27 E:0.097541 |  Arsenal going top of the table, beating Nunningham Forest 3-0, in the championship,
[4442.96 - 4448.16] P:1863.63 E:0.092743 |  Charlton 1-0, Woll-1, Oxford 2-0, Leicester City 2-0, Preston 2-0, Middlesbrough 2-0,
[4449.44 - 4453.44] P:1844.35 E:0.116983 |  in League One, Bradford City beat Huddersfield Town in the West York,
[4453.44 - 4458.40] P:1749.98 E:0.094005 |  Shadarby their first win over their rivals in 20 years, what a start that Graham Alexander's side
[4458.40 - 4462.80] P:1725.94 E:0.096738 |  have had in League One, Northampton beat Blackpool by a goal to Nil, in League Two,
[4462.80 - 4466.80] P:1815.39 E:0.091232 |  Ackerton their first win of the season, beating Colchester 1-0, Crawley 2-0,
[4466.80 - 4471.76] P:1860.49 E:0.086518 |  Cheltenham Nils, sports report at five, the results and the reaction before our next commentary,
[4471.76 - 4476.40] P:1690.40 E:0.094187 |  Westham Tottenham at 5.30. Look at Dynia, just picked up a yellow card there, both full backs
[4476.40 - 4483.04] P:1738.30 E:0.082928 |  now, Buck for Aston Villa, Lim and Jai just rolled him, was the way down that right hand side and
[4483.04 - 4490.32] P:1691.84 E:0.074121 |  Dynia had no other option, putchester pulled a shirt of Lim and Jai. Barnett have quickly
[4490.32 - 4496.48] P:1822.95 E:0.088484 |  equalised at Crue in League Two, so Crue One, Barnett one, Jusbry Hall then, good 15 yards inside the
[4497.44 - 4503.20] P:1781.37 E:0.089022 |  Aston Villa half on this near side the right in front of the box like technical areas here
[4503.20 - 4508.24] P:1791.95 E:0.087410 |  in this new stadium as Jusbry Hall, a little bit wayward, couldn't wrap his left foot around that
[4508.24 - 4513.68] P:1815.59 E:0.088286 |  and he went onto the head of McGinn, up it goes then Mings heads it straight towards Gae,
[4513.68 - 4517.76] P:1884.84 E:0.110607 |  ball through the Beto, first time shot, no, his next touch was a heavy one,
[4518.72 - 4522.64] P:1836.31 E:0.105050 |  it had been better off shooting first time because his second touch was more like a pass
[4522.72 - 4526.40] P:1796.64 E:0.101326 |  to the Aston Villa defence. Yeah, he should have hit it first time, it was perfect for him,
[4526.40 - 4532.24] P:1836.25 E:0.088350 |  or just fizzed across the the six yard box, tried to cut inside, terrible heavy touch,
[4532.24 - 4536.16] P:1718.13 E:0.094331 |  just lacking confidence completely at the moment, isn't he? The big man.
[4538.56 - 4544.48] P:1858.38 E:0.087443 |  He scored two in two, he actually was on target as well on international duty,
[4545.04 - 4550.24] P:1841.83 E:0.094478 |  in February he did score three in three but as you say Stephen, he is not a prolific striker,
[4550.24 - 4555.36] P:1814.37 E:0.084544 |  but they win the ball in the midfield, Jusbry Hall back then to Ghana and Ghana's going to go
[4555.36 - 4559.84] P:1771.49 E:0.100541 |  all the way to Pickford and we'll go back to Craven Cottage in our and Paul. 58 minutes in
[4559.84 - 4564.32] P:1624.52 E:0.108996 |  and it's taken that long for Fulham to have their first opportunity on goal, it's no no,
[4564.32 - 4568.72] P:1825.10 E:0.112197 |  but what a chance it was, Harry Wilson with a curling free kick just outside the D,
[4568.72 - 4573.84] P:1698.65 E:0.120080 |  it was heading into the top corner but propped out to the air from a flying Carl Darlo, no no.
[4574.80 - 4578.88] P:1706.25 E:0.087168 |  Aston Villa who have accrued more points, 101,
[4581.52 - 4588.56] P:1859.92 E:0.105861 |  and they've also scored more goals in 89 against Everton than any other side,
[4590.08 - 4593.52] P:1732.84 E:0.100674 |  but at the minute just cannot get this elusive first goal.
[4597.20 - 4603.36] P:1864.93 E:0.094096 |  Have we got a Swansea, no and Gwyneth? Swansea are back ahead, Swansea two a hurl one,
[4604.08 - 4607.68] P:1894.45 E:0.097621 |  bit of confusion in the hole, the fans they all stop when the ball is played from the left
[4607.68 - 4612.80] P:1887.03 E:0.086657 |  hand side, I thought the whistle had gone, Cross comes in, Ronald Flea in the box taps it in,
[4612.80 - 4618.24] P:1824.82 E:0.103735 |  Swansea two a hurl one. Complaint for nearly an hour, better, gets a blatant shove from behind
[4618.24 - 4624.16] P:1783.76 E:0.092398 |  by Mings but it's in a safe area of the field, midway through the Everton half. Let's get the
[4624.16 - 4628.32] P:1847.42 E:0.085391 |  teamers from West Ham, Alistair Bruce Ball. One change from West Ham from the 3-0 win away
[4628.32 - 4632.08] P:1710.87 E:0.101747 |  to Nottingham Forest, Crescencio Somerville starts, Nicholas Fulcrook is on the bench,
[4632.16 - 4637.60] P:1705.22 E:0.093546 |  Tottenham three changes from the 1-0 defeat against Bournemouth, last time out, Javi Cimons
[4637.60 - 4642.24] P:1768.86 E:0.091629 |  makes his debut, Matthias Telgett to first start of the season and Lucas Bergfau comes in,
[4642.24 - 4647.68] P:1820.96 E:0.086364 |  on the bench, Bentankur, Johnson and Rishalison, Kola Mouane not involved today.
[4648.24 - 4652.88] P:1742.65 E:0.090533 |  Sports report at five, followed at 5.30 with Ali and Paul Robinson, West Ham Tottenham,
[4652.88 - 4658.64] P:1741.31 E:0.091114 |  commentary at 5.30, 6-0-6 after that and then at 10 o'clock live world title boxing on BBC Radio
[4658.64 - 4664.40] P:1728.31 E:0.095580 |  Five Lives. If you've got a long journey taking you home on this Saturday then Five Lives should
[4664.40 - 4670.24] P:1797.58 E:0.093164 |  be your companion all the way through until, well, certainly until they were thought at 11 o'clock,
[4670.88 - 4675.52] P:1816.95 E:0.101212 |  depending on how that fight goes. Barnsley three, Reading one, no other goals to tell you about.
[4677.28 - 4681.60] P:1643.57 E:0.094451 |  Anybody on top for you in the second half? Well I think Villa have been a better team
[4681.60 - 4686.72] P:1590.67 E:0.095380 |  in terms of creating opportunities. Everton have just started now to get that press going but the
[4686.72 - 4690.96] P:1730.74 E:0.097199 |  one thing I was just looking at then, Denner, was the substitutions, both teams have got players
[4690.96 - 4695.84] P:1716.56 E:0.095455 |  that can come on and affect the game, change the game in a positive way so hopefully it won't be
[4695.84 - 4700.96] P:1808.25 E:0.099083 |  0-0 for too much longer. Paul has gone out of play, it's an Everton throw that O'Brien takes quickly,
[4700.96 - 4706.24] P:1829.02 E:0.093204 |  Irribunam just tries to get out of the way from Watkins and then Keane will sweep the ball out
[4706.24 - 4711.68] P:1813.08 E:0.088118 |  towards that far side and Garner is able to turn and he finds Grealish, the player of the month for
[4711.68 - 4718.00] P:1790.95 E:0.087903 |  the Premier League in August and then he just slows it down and back towards Gay on the halfway line.
[4718.00 - 4722.88] P:1707.69 E:0.095821 |  Pat Murphy is at Stoke. Still 1-0 to Stoke, Birmingham more in this game in the second half,
[4722.88 - 4727.12] P:1788.74 E:0.095822 |  Stanfield prominent, he hit the side netting and he was almost through moments ago but
[4727.12 - 4733.44] P:1717.87 E:0.089987 |  Wilmott a great recovering tackle, he had to get that one right and he did. Stoke won Birmingham-0.
[4733.44 - 4738.24] P:1886.26 E:0.084269 |  Everton are attacking, Grealish on the left, just a correction for that team, he's Colin Mouane,
[4738.64 - 4744.72] P:1820.67 E:0.093168 |  actually on the bench for that 5-30 commentary. Tomorrow our games will be Burnley Liverpool
[4744.72 - 4751.84] P:1776.67 E:0.085455 |  at 2 and the Manchester Derby City vs United at 4-30. Here is Gay and that shaft of sunlight
[4751.84 - 4757.44] P:1802.59 E:0.082725 |  that is just now over on that far side of the field on the left. Keane, they're at walking
[4757.44 - 4762.88] P:1755.44 E:0.088203 |  pacer at Everton. Penalty at Bournemouth, Sir Hel Sahi. Penalty 4 Bournemouth, it's Bournemouth 1,
[4762.88 - 4769.04] P:1839.24 E:0.100282 |  Brighton 1, Everneilsson was fouled by Van Hecht, Semenyo is about to take it, just placing the ball
[4769.04 - 4776.48] P:1868.45 E:0.110559 |  on the spot. I think there is a chance for a U-Aurean but Semenyo is about to take it any moment now.
[4780.88 - 4786.72] P:1714.39 E:0.105396 |  Just moves away from the ball Bournemouth 1, Brighton 1, we've played an hour here,
[4786.72 - 4791.28] P:1770.85 E:0.102552 |  Semenyo up against Bournemouth, here he comes, right footed straight down the middle, Bournemouth
[4791.28 - 4797.12] P:1870.89 E:0.091489 |  3-10 the lead, Bournemouth 2, Brighton 1. Crystal Palace 0, Sunderland 0, goal is between Fullamon
[4797.12 - 4803.36] P:1843.65 E:0.096498 |  Leeds United, Newcastle still lead, walls by a goal to 0 and here there was a chance for
[4804.24 - 4808.48] P:1741.44 E:0.094219 |  the Everton, well a couple of chances but there was an injury to an Aston Villa player who was
[4808.48 - 4814.08] P:1775.99 E:0.092772 |  down at the moment, it was Jusbri Hall who's cross, Martinez went in for a brave save
[4815.20 - 4818.08] P:1622.99 E:0.107092 |  and I think it was an Aston Villa player there that was injured in the process.
[4818.08 - 4823.84] P:1622.21 E:0.105799 |  Yeah it's Lucadino left back, he collides with both Martinez and Tyrone Mingz in trying to clear
[4823.84 - 4829.04] P:1675.62 E:0.104373 |  the ball but it was a bit messy for him, Martinez as the ball came in from Jusbri Hall, he just spilled
[4829.04 - 4835.12] P:1543.43 E:0.092514 |  it into the path and then tried to recover, didn't want to spill it too close to the Everton players
[4835.12 - 4840.00] P:1627.94 E:0.091522 |  but the game's just picked up and come to life a little bit again in the last couple of minutes but
[4840.00 - 4846.16] P:1606.52 E:0.091393 |  I think the concern is that it's actually a head injury that Lucadino has received there,
[4846.24 - 4852.00] P:1663.50 E:0.103993 |  is that a bruise to the side of his head? I'm just seeing there's a huge lump on the right side of
[4852.00 - 4856.08] P:1725.16 E:0.099003 |  his head, that is a concern, just trying to see how he's done that.
[4858.64 - 4862.24] P:1720.57 E:0.124589 |  Well so it's a stoppage in play, let's get a result to lead Davis Cup to Tennis,
[4862.24 - 4866.88] P:1699.88 E:0.107335 |  Russell Fuller. Yes Ian Cameron Norrie has completed the task for Great Britain beating
[4866.88 - 4872.96] P:1742.50 E:0.098223 |  Olaf Pieczkowski 6-4, 6-4 so Britain beat Poland 3-1 and will be in the draw for the
[4872.96 - 4878.24] P:1760.79 E:0.085806 |  first round of next year's Davis Cup. Still, Deenu's getting treatment trying the rugby
[4878.24 - 4883.76] P:1866.23 E:0.094919 |  Masferuki. Kanada with two trick tries here Ian, Alicia Corrigan and then Sophie de Goody,
[4883.76 - 4889.20] P:1809.71 E:0.093309 |  he's just about to take the conversion after she touched down herself. Australia had got their
[4889.20 - 4893.60] P:1805.23 E:0.092938 |  points on the board, their first point to this quarter final but Kanada starting to move through
[4893.60 - 4899.60] P:1808.91 E:0.091001 |  the gears, 15-5 they lead this rugby World Cup quarter final at the moment. Deenu's back on his feet
[4900.40 - 4904.72] P:1735.94 E:0.099280 |  which is good from an Aston Villa point of view. Yeah it is, saw the collision again, it was
[4904.72 - 4908.88] P:1688.67 E:0.104300 |  actually a lemon in joy as Deenu was falling to the floor, there was a knee to the side of the
[4908.88 - 4913.36] P:1693.86 E:0.099391 |  head of Luka Deenu. Now the good thing is he's back on his feet but it's just a concern of the
[4913.36 - 4918.48] P:1614.91 E:0.101254 |  concussion, we know how important that is in the Premier League and towards the player safety,
[4918.48 - 4923.04] P:1703.24 E:0.097430 |  Simon Hooper's actually going across to, I think just have a word again with him and see what the
[4923.04 - 4928.24] P:1913.25 E:0.088427 |  situation is. Falkirk Nils St Mirren 1 is the latest score in the Scottish Premier shoot,
[4928.24 - 4934.56] P:1898.41 E:0.095448 |  terrific noise inside this new stadium when the Everton fans are in full voice as they were with
[4934.56 - 4940.80] P:1859.77 E:0.083143 |  that flurry of activity before the injury. Villera down to 10, corner kick then from that far side
[4940.80 - 4945.04] P:1915.16 E:0.087169 |  almost drops towards and Jai, Tarkovsky's header took it out of his path and Jai now battles for
[4945.04 - 4950.24] P:1908.29 E:0.092201 |  the ball against two Aston Villa players, Bogart they will safely marshal it out for a goal kick
[4950.24 - 4957.04] P:1835.06 E:0.082073 |  and Deenu will come back on to the field of play once he's got the thumbs up from referee Simon
[4957.04 - 4962.88] P:1640.78 E:0.089825 |  Hooper which isn't at the moment. It's a frustrating rule of the 30 seconds now I know they say it's
[4962.88 - 4967.20] P:1719.34 E:0.098117 |  because you don't want them to feign injury but you can quite clearly see he's had a knock to the
[4967.20 - 4972.16] P:1724.76 E:0.093205 |  head he's got the bruise to show it, just letting back on the pitch, silly rule. Getting update from
[4972.16 - 4977.52] P:1884.20 E:0.099148 |  Ibrox Gavin Wallace. Yes though Rangers Nils, Hearts 1, Casano Deenu with a great shot just inside
[4977.52 - 4982.32] P:1871.79 E:0.095895 |  the box opened up his body really nicely and it had to be parried away by the goalkeeper Rangers Nils,
[4982.64 - 4990.96] P:1822.46 E:0.083130 |  Hearts 1. It remains Everton Nils, Aston Villa Nils, McGinn referee plays the advantage and then
[4990.96 - 4998.40] P:1875.72 E:0.109836 |  brings it back because the early ball McGinn was being held there by Jusbree Hall and Jusbree Hall
[4998.40 - 5003.92] P:1844.32 E:0.090061 |  is going to go into the book the second Everton player to be booked and the fourth yellow card
[5003.92 - 5009.20] P:1783.38 E:0.093493 |  that has been shown by Simon Hooper. I think it's a yellow card but I think it's too late in
[5009.20 - 5013.36] P:1746.71 E:0.100831 |  bringing the play back you've allowed it to go through to Morgan Rodgers and just because he's
[5013.36 - 5018.64] P:1707.13 E:0.105943 |  misplayed a pass he brings the play back well I think that's the wrong decision completely because
[5019.36 - 5024.16] P:1709.23 E:0.104116 |  doesn't matter if he misplaces the pass you've played on.
[5025.68 - 5031.12] P:1827.99 E:0.121322 |  Timir Abunam who was signed from Aston Villa for £9 million made 19 appearances comes off
[5031.84 - 5037.20] P:2021.99 E:0.111396 |  and Merlin Rool comes on at German under 21 international for his Everton debut they've
[5037.20 - 5045.12] P:1881.55 E:0.092702 |  got him on loan from Freiburg but it is with an obligation to buy for £17.3 million and David
[5045.12 - 5053.28] P:1850.38 E:0.088405 |  Moyes is hoping that he will be an energetic and athletic midfielder. 60 appearances and three
[5053.28 - 5060.40] P:1896.71 E:0.092311 |  goals in the last three years for Freiburg and so he comes on. He's a good player this guy I watched
[5060.40 - 5067.12] P:1802.24 E:0.087080 |  him in the under 21s against England for Germany he's that type of player who can see a pass but

[5122.96 - 5129.20] P:1827.21 E:0.098415 |  Aston Villa bench. Harvey Elliott is going to be coming on. What sort of reception he might get?
[5131.60 - 5140.48] P:1855.60 E:0.092193 |  I think I'll be okay. Here is in Jai. Jaden Sancho and Victor Lindelof. Other acquisitions on

[5168.00 - 5176.40] P:1800.24 E:0.088777 |  Buendia who will be coming off for Harvey Elliott to make his Aston Villa debut. A loan from Liverpool
[5176.40 - 5182.56] P:1825.80 E:0.097523 |  but again obligation to buy for £35 million. Wimbledon two rather than United one is the latest
[5182.56 - 5188.88] P:1811.49 E:0.089721 |  score in league one. Aston Villa are attacking. Greelys. Gesson with a challenge. Did he get the
[5188.88 - 5195.04] P:1844.51 E:0.111423 |  ball? The referee says no and then gives a free kick to Aston Villa. Gesson falls over. That was
[5195.04 - 5200.16] P:1786.83 E:0.110720 |  hardly a shove at all from Greelys who gets a yellow card for his protest as we will go to Adam
[5200.16 - 5206.16] P:1836.09 E:0.086395 |  Cotter at Stockport. Stockport one. Cardiff Nill here. Cardiff heading towards their first defeat

[5218.88 - 5226.48] P:1618.85 E:0.091964 |  was for adopting an aggressive attitude. Interesting. You can't do anything these days can you?
[5227.04 - 5232.88] P:1684.00 E:0.092852 |  Absolutely incredible. Wrexham have got a goal back. Wrexham won. Queen's part rangers two in the
[5232.88 - 5237.92] P:1753.60 E:0.098723 |  championship. We're midway through the second half and it remains Nill Nill. Harvey Elliott waits
[5237.92 - 5242.40] P:1837.35 E:0.108627 |  to come on. Mings is going to try and bring the ball forward but there was rule. Who would win the
[5242.40 - 5247.60] P:1874.27 E:0.111850 |  ball for Everton? Gay. Lays it out towards and Jai. Beto has stayed short. Sliding back with
[5247.60 - 5252.24] P:1891.15 E:0.120004 |  Gwendir. He says he got the ball and Jai rolls around. The supporters are up and out of their
[5252.24 - 5260.32] P:1929.54 E:0.093353 |  seats in front of us. Simon Hooper is calling the Aston Villa player towards him and it's just
[5260.40 - 5265.60] P:1807.42 E:0.098291 |  starting to get a little bit niggly. A bit of a feistyness in the game which is good. It's what
[5265.60 - 5270.40] P:1723.79 E:0.098926 |  you want to see but just hope Simon Hooper doesn't get carried away and think he's the centre of
[5270.40 - 5277.12] P:1736.88 E:0.090165 |  attention. So Gwendir will be shown yellow. He'll then be coming off the field of play to be substituted.
[5277.12 - 5281.44] P:1798.98 E:0.103964 |  We will go to sell his part. John Bennett. Crystal Palace Nill. Sunderland Nill. Huge

[5286.56 - 5290.48] P:1907.53 E:0.105244 |  for his debut to try and win this game. Crystal Palace Nill. Sunderland Nill.

[5296.48 - 5301.68] P:1870.18 E:0.087773 |  We've got the Champions League to look forward to next week. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
[5301.68 - 5307.68] P:1730.76 E:0.092975 |  Three successive nights of Champions League coverage to bring you as Elliott is on and there
[5308.24 - 5310.88] P:1727.74 E:0.104531 |  are the booms that we talked about.
[5313.04 - 5318.24] P:1823.83 E:0.117475 |  So he's only played six minutes of football for Liverpool this season. He's taken to
[5318.24 - 5322.64] P:1851.69 E:0.107807 |  consideration the community shield and a last-minute appearance against Newcastle.
[5323.36 - 5328.48] P:1820.50 E:0.110607 |  Barrow have got to go back at Bristol Robes. Bristol Robes two. Barrow one. Mansfield Town Nill.
[5328.48 - 5333.04] P:1855.04 E:0.098567 |  Stevenage one is the latest scoring league one and you're up to date as Tuesday Hall
[5333.04 - 5336.96] P:1800.76 E:0.091075 |  waits to take this free kick and Pickford has actually come up to the halfway line and gives
[5336.96 - 5342.48] P:1834.27 E:0.087849 |  it back to Dewisbury Hall who can now inch his way forward. Floats it diagonal ball long left foot
[5342.48 - 5348.88] P:1814.09 E:0.083665 |  it out towards Grealish left hand side of the area up against Gesson. Gesson then will hold off Grealish
[5348.88 - 5355.04] P:1846.25 E:0.092620 |  dives into the challenge. Grealish quickly back off his knees back to his feet. Fronts up Gesson
[5355.04 - 5362.24] P:1862.78 E:0.105301 |  once again delivers the cross. Keywood ahead of Watta say by Enid Martinez. That was a world
[5362.32 - 5368.64] P:1831.55 E:0.101572 |  class save by Enid Martinez. It looked a certain goal. It was brilliant from Grealish on the right
[5368.64 - 5374.72] P:1716.89 E:0.104237 |  hand side nipping inside sorry the left hand side nips onto his right foot delivers a wicked ball
[5374.72 - 5380.56] P:1802.45 E:0.094304 |  and Keywood gets across his man. He wins that initial header gets the flick in front to Konza
[5380.56 - 5386.72] P:1851.11 E:0.096342 |  and that is an outstanding a world class save from Emi Martinez. That's why the Villafans are happy
[5386.72 - 5391.04] P:1809.03 E:0.099496 |  to have him back in the goal. You can tell how good it was it had the R reaction when they saw it on
[5391.04 - 5395.20] P:1881.53 E:0.103846 |  the giant screens corner taken quickly in towards Ilimanjai and then a sliding watch
[5395.20 - 5401.68] P:1917.14 E:0.093727 |  just blocks Ilimanjai and then in fact the referee has changed his mind as
[5401.68 - 5405.44] P:1880.49 E:0.108197 |  Jusbury Hall is preparing to take the corner. He's now said it will be a goal kick.
[5406.88 - 5410.72] P:1824.05 E:0.105444 |  18 minutes remain still 0-0. Let's get an update from Newcastle Mike Minay.
[5411.28 - 5415.28] P:1868.04 E:0.100293 |  Changes have been made. Newcastle two of them including their goal scorer Nick Volta Marder
[5415.28 - 5419.76] P:2000.33 E:0.095584 |  on his debut. He scored his off or Shuler's on. Will it come for Joe Linton? Wolves have made a
[5419.76 - 5423.84] P:1951.14 E:0.094702 |  triple change as they chase an equaliser but they've been far from at it in this second half.
[5423.84 - 5429.44] P:1945.71 E:0.100014 |  Newcastle won Wolves 0-0 22 minutes left. Late Norrie at one ball to Wanderers 0 is the latest
[5429.44 - 5436.32] P:1948.87 E:0.092018 |  score in League one. The goal kick taken short. Everton poised to press. Emi Martinez has the
[5436.32 - 5442.08] P:1894.16 E:0.098314 |  ball at his feet and his lemon yellow in his six yard area. Now hits it right footed downfield.
[5442.08 - 5446.64] P:1835.01 E:0.095670 |  Keane in a bit of a tussle there. Wrestling match with Gesson runs through to Jusbury Hall.
[5446.64 - 5451.84] P:1945.72 E:0.092945 |  Links up once again with Grealish. Cash stays tight to him. Ball though quickly picks up off
[5451.84 - 5456.48] P:1832.87 E:0.087805 |  the little cone on that far side. Everton wanted to take the throw quickly but the ball had bounced
[5456.48 - 5460.72] P:1875.48 E:0.080910 |  back off one of the electronic hoardings and therefore we had two balls on the pitch and
[5460.72 - 5464.00] P:1745.55 E:0.097862 |  it just slows everything down. Yeah there's a lovely understanding between Grealish and
[5464.00 - 5468.56] P:1781.88 E:0.098702 |  Jusbury Hall. They linked up against Wolves for the Jusbury Hall goal but there's a real
[5468.56 - 5472.88] P:1725.17 E:0.092166 |  understanding between the two that they're trying to find each other. They know the runs they're
[5472.88 - 5478.00] P:1830.14 E:0.082945 |  trying to make and being the two positives for Everton again today. Swindon Town have come from
[5478.00 - 5483.52] P:1820.39 E:0.091360 |  behind and they're on course for a fifth straight win. Swindon two, Harrogate one, they look to
[5483.52 - 5487.76] P:1896.62 E:0.098274 |  match. Killing him the leaders, stride for stride at the top. Here is O'Brien trying to power his
[5487.76 - 5494.16] P:1911.42 E:0.101308 |  way forward being pulled back by Rogers and O'Brien as well fires in the cross off the legs of
[5494.16 - 5499.28] P:1860.23 E:0.091314 |  Dina and Everton get a throw right down by the corner flag. Mansfield Town have equalised at
[5499.28 - 5505.28] P:1826.99 E:0.088478 |  home to Stevenage in league one at Field Mill. Mansfield one, Stevenage one and Tino Barry is
[5505.28 - 5510.00] P:1722.79 E:0.085801 |  going to be coming on for Everton. So I'd imagine that that will be for for better wouldn't it? Like
[5510.00 - 5515.76] P:1850.87 E:0.081311 |  for like for the young forward that they signed from Via Real. Indeed it will. So O'Brien with a
[5515.76 - 5521.68] P:1824.35 E:0.089213 |  long throw into the penalty area and that was met very forcefully by Mings downward header and then
[5521.68 - 5528.16] P:1903.22 E:0.084801 |  that will be blocked. The attempted clearance by O'Brien and it goes out of play for a goal kick.
[5528.16 - 5533.92] P:1881.55 E:0.102631 |  So Tino Barry is going to come on and where will we go next? And it's Bournemouth to Hellside.
[5533.92 - 5538.32] P:1817.17 E:0.109269 |  15 minutes to play here Bournemouth leading Brighton by two goals to one but this game very much on
[5538.32 - 5543.44] P:1920.10 E:0.098239 |  an eye-fed Brighton have made three changes in the last five minutes and they're going forward
[5543.44 - 5549.76] P:1894.76 E:0.092663 |  in search of a second equaliser. Bournemouth two, Brighton one. He's had chances to take the get the
[5549.76 - 5554.72] P:1730.85 E:0.109686 |  goal today better but as he gets a paddle about from David Moyes unable to do so that's why
[5554.72 - 5560.08] P:1878.66 E:0.096161 |  we're still locked at 0-0 with about 15 minutes remaining as we will go to Crystal Palace. Who's
[5560.08 - 5565.44] P:1862.56 E:0.094753 |  just had a chance? John Bennett. A big chance for Crystal Palace. Palace 0, Sunderland 0. Brilliant
[5565.44 - 5571.60] P:1913.15 E:0.104750 |  save by the Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Rooster tonight. Kamada low shot great one man handed save.
[5571.60 - 5576.56] P:1874.75 E:0.104662 |  Palace 0, Sunderland 0. Goal is there, goal is here. Also goal is at Fullham Aaron Paul.
[5576.56 - 5581.60] P:1555.05 E:0.113343 |  Yeah still 0-0. A couple of big chances to Fullham. Rodrigo Munez with a header well saved by Karl
[5581.60 - 5587.60] P:1734.27 E:0.103622 |  Dahlert and Emil Smithrow clipping the outside of the post with a shot. Record signing Kevin
[5587.60 - 5594.56] P:1804.17 E:0.087807 |  is on Fullham. 0-0. Throw for Everton. Oh Brian to take it goes in field towards Keen. These are the
[5594.56 - 5600.00] P:1852.15 E:0.101126 |  latest scores in the Scottish Premiership. Aberdeen 0, Livingston 0. Dundee 1, Motherwell 1. Falkirk
[5600.00 - 5607.04] P:1805.77 E:0.097318 |  0, St. Mirren 1. Ranges still trailing to Hartz by a goal to 0 at Ibrox. Lauren Shanklin with that
[5607.04 - 5613.76] P:1932.41 E:0.095713 |  first half goal that would take Hartz three points clear of Celtic who play tomorrow at Kilmarnock.
[5617.36 - 5625.60] P:1829.33 E:0.068525 |  Aston Villa have got a free kick which has been knocked short and square by Mings to Conser
[5625.60 - 5631.28] P:1870.41 E:0.076803 |  got his first goal for England in midweek in that impressive performance against Serbia in Belgrade
[5631.28 - 5636.32] P:1769.47 E:0.077240 |  McGinn now towards Mings over the halfway line along the ground laid off by Elliott.
[5637.36 - 5642.48] P:1871.89 E:0.084183 |  Cash just forced to retreat a little bit still inside the Villa half out towards Guessan but
[5642.48 - 5647.84] P:1765.02 E:0.079030 |  it's a nice gentle walking pace isn't it Stephen? Yeah they're not in a rush to to lose the ball here
[5647.84 - 5652.64] P:1693.11 E:0.081095 |  Aston Villa they realise that whenever Everton pick up the ball the pace of the game picks up and
[5652.64 - 5658.08] P:1669.12 E:0.094555 |  this is the style that Unai Emery likes his teams to play in but now we see that tussling that
[5658.72 - 5664.56] P:1767.76 E:0.094965 |  gritty determination from Everton as they win the ball back again. Aston Villa have never
[5664.56 - 5671.36] P:1903.29 E:0.078555 |  failed to score in their first four games of a league season. Nil nil it remains. In league two

[6369.04 - 6373.04] P:1731.06 E:0.113292 |  feeling from him is that he wants his team to speed up the process they're in Everton
[6373.04 - 6380.64] P:1826.01 E:0.101631 |  forward up towards Barry nins has to come across Barry accelerates and Barry has the shot as he

[6884.56 - 6888.96] P:1690.52 E:0.092761 |  slowly came back into the game and then they started the better team in the second half but
[6888.96 - 6893.68] P:1564.94 E:0.095416 |  Everton much much stronger at the end they'll be the team that are bitterly disappointed
[6893.76 - 6898.96] P:1615.21 E:0.095615 |  two big opportunities for Beto should have been three points for Everton but it's a positive for
[6898.96 - 6902.88] P:1662.67 E:0.088725 |  Aston Villa a clean sheet points on the board something to build from.
