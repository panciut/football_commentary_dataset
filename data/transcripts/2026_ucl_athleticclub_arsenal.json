  "transcript": " Club legend, Petitci. Played for this club a long time ago. Petitci, actually, the nickname means Little Duck, and he was slight of frame, but he was a mighty player, scored lots of goals for Athletic Bill Bauer. It's Arsenal's first ever game, competitive game, against Athletic Bill Bauer, and that is one of the great traditions of this great football club, and now the atmosphere builds again ahead of kickoff, and Arsenal sort of try and seal themselves away from it a little bit. They're in a team huddle down, way down below us on that pitch, and they just break away from that. David Ryder gives Cala Fiori a big hug. The Arsenal fans just under 3,000 of them, up high away to our right-hand side through the Arsenal flags. You can see there at the front of their section behind the netting, and the game is about to get underway. Only two English clubs have ever won here in European competition. Manchester United did it last season, first leg of the Europa League semi-final. Liverpool did it at the Old Sandman Estadium. Back in 1983, 84, a certain Ian Rush scored the only goal of the game on route to winning the European Cup that season. That is what Arsenal are trying to do this season for the first time in their history, and their Champions League campaign gets underway. Rice plays it back to Ryder. Ryder goes long, Merino heads it forward, headed away by Danny Vivian, nodded down the line by Timber, and then hoofed away by Adama Boyro, who starts at left back for Athletic Bilbao. It is a really interesting team selection from the home team. Four changes, the ball has come in. It's their first start to the season for all of them. Big changes from the Atlético Bilbao manager. I think obviously they lost last time out at home against Alves to a surprise defeat to an own goal. They had a great start to the season, other than that, maybe that's something the coaches are thinking. They actually played a friendly game during the international break. The coach had the majority of their players. They had a friendly game behind closed doors, so you do wonder whether those selections have come from something like that. I'll remind you of the two-team line-ups and just the second when we get our first break in play, just under a minute in, Arsenal seeing lots of the ball. Gabrielle is the captain, William Saliva, on his way back to fitness on the bench, but Christian Mosquera, the 21-year-old Spaniard signed from Valencia. He's done really well since coming into the Arsenal team, pressing to emergency action at Anfield when Saliva went down. They've really well against Nottingham Forest at the weekend. Gears and whistles for Ryder on the ball for Arsenal. It comes into midfield. He's played back by Zubemendi to the goalkeeper again. Now out to Gabrielle, an athletic Bilbao in the red and white vertical strikes. Red panels on their backs with white numbers on those, black shorts and black socks. Paul. Another interesting change from the manager. We spoke about the formation before and who made it a threat, in a very, very orthodox 4-4-2 formation. Inaki Williams, the captain, he's up front alongside Santhert. Berenge, who we thought might be deployed down the centre, he's actually playing on the right-hand side. They're quite happy here at the moment without the ball, a quite sacrificial in possession, allowing Arsenal to dominate the possession, as you can probably tell by the noises in the background. Zubemendi plays to Timber. Timber dummy to pass up the touch line, nearly lost the ball there. Mosquera gives it a good thump, crossed the halfway line. It bounces on the halfway line, hoisted forward into the Arsenal half. Zubemendi comes forward to win the header. Eza nods it back into his own half. Got a shove in the back, no free kick. The referee's going to let that go. The ball is back with David Reier. So, Eza making a Champions League debut, so is Mosquera at the back for Arsenal. And Noni Medwayke played in Champions League qualifying rounds for PSV Eindhoven. This is his first appearance in the competition proper. Timber plays back to Mosquera. Mosquera across to Gabrielle, just outside the Arsenal penalty area. The pitch pretty much entirely draped in shade. A few splashes of sunshine down there. Just coming up to 7 o'clock local time in the evening in northern Spain. As Gabrielle goes long, looking for Yurkarez, beaten in the air by Perades. Yurkarez battles again. The ball bounces in the centre circle. Perades nips in, lost the ball up in the air. It's brought down here by Timber. He goes to Medwayke on the right-hand side, and immediately those Redmond White shirts are back so quickly and surrounding Arsenal when they get into possession in attacking positions. They had the best defensive record in the league last season. Obviously took them to the semi-final of the Europa League here where they lost 3-0 to Manchester United, but they went down to 10 men. Obviously Vivian and Perades, the two centre halves, they form a great partnership and they're very defensively organised. Valverde works very hard on the training ground with them out of possession. Gabrielle's ball forward, intercepted by Perades. He plays it through the middle of the pitch here. Possibly a chance to hit a shot from Reigns. They still keep coming in. Califuri gets a foot in. Before David Rye was about to be tested, home fans love the early attacking initiative from Athletic Bill Bauer. Push on Timber, free kick for Arsenal in the middle of their own half. So coming up to four minutes played in the Champions League, first round of fixtures in this league phase this season. Athletic Bill Bauer, Arsenal, Neil Paul Robinson. We talk about the tough test for Arsenal coming here tonight. People say they come out of pot four, but when you look at their record last year and when they got to the semi-final of the Europa League, they finished fourth behind Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. 70 points in the league last season, whilst at the same time having the best defensive record. This is a tough test for Arsenal tonight. If they get through this, it'll be a big statement. Incredibly experienced manager as well. Ernesto Valverde, a third-spelling charge of the club, has managed more games in charge of Athletic Bill Bauer than any other, 457, and counting this evening. Former Barcelona boss who famously was in charge when Barcelona lost that Champions League semi-final second leg at Amfield against Liverpool by four goals to Neil. This is Athletic Bill Bauer, Neil Arsenal, five live and BBC sounds. Tottenham Villareal commentary from eight o'clock this evening. We'll keep you across all the goals as they go in. League Cup commentaries on the Sports Extra Networks as well. And Arsenal just playing some patient keep ball inside the Athletic Bill Bauer half. Pass from Madelueva, he doesn't quite find Timber. Interception from Boiro, goes out for an Arsenal throw. Timber takes that quickly down the line to Yurkares. He holds it up, can't find Marino. Supermendi's there to intercept the ball forward, then Marino plays a pass back into his own half and finds Gabrielle and Arsenal quickly ship it out to the left-hand side. Here's Calafiori, the pass is beyond. There's a little run-out for a throw-in to Athletic Bill Bauer. I'm not sure that Arsenal expected to have this much early possession. From the start, we're coming up to the six minute of the game, but they've had the majority of the ball rotating possession, keeping the ball, I think with the atmosphere and the way that Athletic Club do normally start games, they expected to be pressed, pressed high. Athletic Club had one attempt coming down the right-hand side, but actually Arsenal have controlled the tempo of the game. Six minutes in, 0-0, long ball downfield, headed forward by Moschera, Rice can't quite control it. Comes off his right boot and goes out for a throw-in to Athletic Bill Bauer. The offside flag was up, so it's actually going to be a free kick to the home team. Don't forget, Champions League highlights back on the BBC as well this season. So 10-40 tomorrow on BBC One, then Mark Chapman has Jimmy Floyd, Hasselbank and Julianne LeRan as his guests, and BBC Two on Thursday at 11 o'clock, Gabby Logan will host the show, Newcastle Barcelona, Manchester City, Napoli amongst the highlights. We've got commentary tomorrow night on Five Live, a bi-amunic against Chelsea, and Thursday night, Newcastle, Barcelona with Manchester City, Napoli on SportSex. Arsenal with defending to do, the ball breaks here to Hauregifre, chips it into the area, back across goal, really important in deception from Gabrielle. The danger is not averted just yet, driven shot from the edge of the box. Gabrielle is there again, and the Catholic Bill bow fans are pealing for a foul on how to get it on the edge of the box, and the referee agrees, and not only that, gives the free kick, and books Declan Rice for the challenge. Yeah, he's got his arms in the air, Declan Rice protesting his innocence to the referee, but it was clever play from Jaren Geitha there, central midfield, there's a deep line midfielder, he's always available, chips a ball over the top, looking for a Nackie Williams, ball comes back out to Jaren Geitha, looks to strike it first time, Declan Rice just gets there after he's made connection with the ball, over the top, catches the athletic club player, and they've got a free kick in a really dangerous area. Berengeir is one of those who stands over the ball, the left back Adama Boyro comes forward as well, and you can see how it would suit the left footer, because the ball is just outside the Arsenal penalty area, in the inside right channel. Arsenal have all the big men lined up in a one, two, three, four, five man wall, and someone's going to have to do the old draft excluder job as well, but at the moment David Ryre is down on his horses, he's all in green away to our right, getting the wall in the right position, it could be Alex Berengeir, and it could be Adama Boyro, and as you can hear, the stadium is pumped, bright white line of vanishing spray, just across the boot tops of the Arsenal defenders in that wall. David Ryre just trying to make sure he's got a view to the right-hand side of the Arsenal wall as he looks out, and the wall is going to try and protect the left of his goal for him, long shrill blast on the whistle, it is Berengeir, backheels it, Boyro hit that hard, ball is loose inside the Arsenal area, and it's cleared away by Timber, the shot was on target, it just couldn't get through all the bodies, now the cross comes into the Arsenal penalty area, Timber heads it away, Ezzer's going to chase, trying wind possession for Arsenal, he can't do that, more thunderous applause, brings around this stadium, and there's got to sabre the right back, playing back to Vivienne, and in the end they've come back to their goalkeeper. Spain's number one, Oonai Simon, all in bright orange, he's over hit that pass, it bounces twice, and his international teammate David Ryre, chests it down, and Arsenal will start to play out. That was a good set play that from Athletic Club, really well worked, Berengeir looked like he was going to strike the ball, and the Arsenal ball actually moved to the left when he was going to strike it, rolled it under the sole of his spot to Boyro, he struck it with his laces, thankfully for Arsenal, found his own player and made the block, no real danger. Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson with us at the San Mames Stadium, Athletic Bilbao, Arsenal 0, that is Mosquera, chips the ball to the right, Timber's got a leap there, now he can't keep that in play, wouldn't have even caught that with his hands at the peak of his jump, it was an over hit pass, it's gone out for the Athletic Bilbao throw, they've taken it, they've come back into their own half, and of course Kepper, who is now Arsenal's backup goalkeeper, was an Athletic Bilbao player, Chelsea bought him from this club for a massive, massive sum which was plowed back into facilities in the academy and such like, and has done a lot of good for the club, and Unais Simona has just continued as the club's goalkeeper all the way through. I've never been to the training facilities, but I can vouch that they're very plush and excellent, we flew over them yesterday, saw them as we came into land, and they're rather nice, they've got quite a few pitches, huge building with their crest and blazoned on the top of it, so that'll be thanks to Kepper. Yes indeed, here's Gabrielle, sticks the foot in, Ezzer, clever little ball over his right shoulder, releases Reiss, charges forward down the left, offside flag stays down, Yurkares in the penalty area with the cutback, intercepted by Viviane at the near post, then the offside flag goes up, so they were waiting to see what happened in the attacking phase of play, system referee raises his flag, and Athletic Bill Bow will have the free kick. Ten minutes in, Athletic Bill Bow, Arsenal nil, and I haven't heard otherwise, so I'm presuming, I'm just going to check PSV nil, Union Saint-Gilouin nil, which is the other early kickoff in the Champions League this afternoon, and we'll bring it up on my screen in just a second free kick coming here. For the home team, Unaise Simon places the ball down, seven, eight yards outside his own penalty area, drives it forward with his right foot to the edge of the Arsenal box, it bounces dangerously, Navarro will get there wide on the left, Timber is breathing down his neck, sticks the right foot in, and it goes out for the throwing to Athletic Bill Bow, and in fact, no I'm wrong, Union Saint-Gilouin have scored early in that game, so in the ninth minute they have taken the lead away from home against PSV, so that is your first goal in the Champions League, League phase this season, Union Saint-Gilouin playing in their first ever Champions League, they've taken the lead at PSV, long throw into the penalty area, all the rage nowadays, long throws, Miquel Arter was asked about that, was that a hand ball by Ezra, into his own box, referee says no, now for the Bill Bow though, have the ball on the right with Berenge, Berenge is shadowed by Ezra, plays the ball back to Haura Geitha, Sam Fett gets the ball back with a little back heel from Garas Sable, then the cross comes in with the far post, dangerous ball, Timber tries to head it away, and the Ackee Williams behind him couldn't control it but his head has gone behind for the goal kick, Niel Niel. They're looking more and more dangerous, Athletic Club has a wonderful ball across the six yard box there, no Arsenal defender could touch it, Timber actually does really well at the far post just to leave it to Anaki Williams, he's the one who ends up putting it out for a corner, but Sam Fett gets in on the right hand side, plays a really nice one too, lays the ball back and it's played right across the six yard box, very difficult to defend, Williams puts it out for a goal kick in the end. Athletic Bill Bow currently second in La Liga, started the season with three wins out of three, then rather surprisingly lost that home in this stadium at the weekend, local Derby as well against Alibis. Ryder clears first time with his right foot, that's not going to find a teammate, you've got a star belt, can let the ball bounce, you've got to play for a throw, in a relatively attacking position here for Athletic Bill Bow, Mikhail Artheta looks slightly exorcised, he's going to be warmed down there, dark black jumper, tight fitting grey trousers, black shiny shoes on the edge of the pitch here, Coradis plays the ball back to the goalkeeper, Simon, Simon delicately floats it forward, Berengueh sticks out the studs of his right boot, gets a touch on the ball, 50-50 now, Ezra and Rice have lost it, here's Berengueh, dribbling forward for Athletic Bill Bow, hits the shot into the legs of Gabrielle, and it goes off the Brazilian for a corner. It's certainly on the front foot now, Athletic Club, Berengueh getting in some really dangerous positions on this right-hand side, over the most during the right-hand side, Santhet's drifting over to this right-hand side, taking on Calafuri, doubling up on him, Inaki Williams looking for the runs in behind, got the self a corner, but you can tell by the noise in the stadium, the team and the supporters are growing in confidence. Almost 14 minutes played, still 0-0, Berengueh with the corner away, swing ahead, it away at the near post, half folly from Jair Githa, goes straight up, and yeah, Rice spilled it, but he's OK, it bounced in front of him, and he catches it on that bounce and then runs out to the edge of the penalty area, made his 100th appearance for Arsenal, in the 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest on Saturday, keeping a 40-second clean sheet, spoke really well, I thought, actually, in the press conference yesterday, here's Merino battling for the ball in the Arsenal midfield, he's down on the floor and he's lost it, so here come Athletic Bill Bow again, that is Sanfet, who's in this front two with Iñaki Williams, 17 goals he scored last season, third top scorer in La Liga, behind Lewandowski and Dumbapé, there's Vivian, plays it into the midfield, to Jair Githa, short pass from him to his right-hand side to Sanfet, he's got Declan Rice in his way, Athletic Bill Bow working into the middle of the pitch here, and Vesga, Mikhail Vesga, one of the four changes, one of the ones to come into the starting line-up this evening, lays the ball off, makes a run through the middle of the pitch, Haldegi for the 21-year-old, nice turn and pass, Navarro to his right-hand side, here's Sanfet, Sanfet is closed down by Calafiori, pass comes back to Garasarbo, Beto and Gair just holds off the challenge there from Yurkárez, short pass to Navarro again, turning inside the box, then tries to chip a ball to the far post, blocked at close range, Merino wins ahead of, he's fouled in midair, he makes the most of that as he falls, sort of wriggling around, like a fish that's just been hoisted out of the river, and the referee's buying that and says free kick to Arsenal. I think he knows that his team needed that, Mikhail Merino, his team are a little bit under pressure there, they're not getting close enough at the moment, Arsenal, Athletic Club have kicked into gear, they're keeping the ball, they're rotating possession, they're finding the little pockets, Arsenal playing with the three in midfield, Rice, Zubemendi and Merino, they're actually being very narrow, because of the way the Athletic Club are playing, which is forcing Eze and Maddoekki deeper to try and cover the wing-backs that are pushing on. Look at you giving it the old Athletic Club, getting him in the locals. That's what I've been told now, we all know what we're talking about, don't we? That lot in red and white, but by the way, I've never been inside a football stadium where almost every single person has got the home shirt on, it's red and white everywhere, it's like a sub-bouty old stadium, isn't it? And we were in the stadium quite early, but you showed me the footage when you were here last season of the build-up in the streets outside the ground as well, and it's just, again, a wash with everyone in the red and white shirts, Rice stretching, loses the ball inside his own half, and Gorsabel plays back to Unaise Simon, which is why one of my questions in the presentation last night was, can a kid grow up in this city and choose to support any other club? And the answer to that basically is no, you've got no chance. Absolutely no chance. But you can see the pride and the passion and what it means to the city. You talk about a one-club city, but actually the club is at the heart of the city, isn't it, where the stadium is? Merino is definitely fouled there by Boiro just short of the halfway line. Well, exactly, Paul, and you think about the club used to play for. Harry Kane playing for them, he's one of our own, he's one of our own, that's such a big thing. The entire team here, throughout their history, pretty much, they are all ones of their own. That is how it works, and that's why you have such an attachment to your football club. And the point, the other point that was made to me last night was when they lose games, the fans don't necessarily get on the team's back because they do feel as one with them. This is a good move, building up for Arsenal. Yurkares couldn't quite control the ball from Timber, hoisted away in the air again by Garasarba. Merino chases it back, awkward, couple of bounces here, Navarro behind him, gets it back to Raya, bobbling pass, and Raya clears it first time, chested down by Timber. Zubemendi's got time to get his head up here, lofts it on the half volley with his left foot. Yurkares sticks out a right boot, and barges into Peredes, and the assistant referee waves his flag and says that is going to be a free kick to Athletic Bill Bow. Athletic Bill Bow, Arsenal nil, and Union Sanjilwa, one nil up, away to PSV. Tottenham Villareal is our commentary at eight, and we'll bring you the goals from some great games tonight. Real Madrid in action at home against Marseille, Juventus against Borussia Dortmund, and Benfica against Carabag. It's back, Paul, the Champions League is back. You like saying that, don't you, that team's name? Which one? The one that played PSV? Union Sanjilwa. You like that, don't you? Well, Julianne LeRon got in touch, actually, before the show, and said, make sure you pronounce that right, so I'm probably butchering it, actually, to be fair, but giving it my best shot. Simon. Athletic Bill Bow's goalkeeper clears, it hits Califiori on the thigh, he then leans in, chest the ball down to himself, lays it back into Zubemendi, chip ball forward, intercepted by Peredes, scruffy football here at the moment, Mosquera lets that bounce, Timber jumps, wins ahead, Reno lent towards that. I think that might have hit his arm, yes, referee spotted that. That's going to be a free kick for Athletic. Scruffy, isn't it? Neither team really settled in the last five, six minutes or so. Interesting thing for Arsenal is Yorker as he's cutting a very, very lonely figure. Like I said, the possession that Athletic Bill Bow had, it's forced Eze and Maddoeki into more of a defensive position, so every time Arsenal have turned over possession, Yorker as he's isolated, he's chasing down lost causes. I'd be surprised if he's touched the ball more than once. Free kick then, Athletic Bill Bow, middle of the Arsenal half. He's in at pace, but it's straight at Ryre, he's in a good position, edge of the six yard box, and he puts his hands in front of his face and catches the ball cleanly, then bowls it out over, I'm a Calafiori, tall Italian, hair tied back, loads of space to work with, brings it up to the halfway line, one, two with Eze, back to Calafiori, the pass is beyond Gabrielle, no danger though. David Ryre's behind him, he comes and collects for Arsenal, and he quickly ships the ball out to the right-hand side. As we walked in, Paul, at a lower level, you felt the grass look quite long on this pitch tonight. It did, didn't it, as we came in, we were almost at pitch level, you could see. It's a pitch that's been heavily watered beforehand, as we know groundsmen, and women like to keep their pitch longer at this stage of the season to prevent any scars and any long-lasting damage. I don't think it will have any effect because it would be so wet. And the Accu-Williams lays the ball off, that's a miscube from Vesga, move was building nicely for Athletic Bill Bow, that's what I mean. You hear those sort of ooze and aahs of disappointment, and then it's applause, clearly they're back in the team because they're in good form. I was amazed, it was exactly the same when they lost 3-0 here to Manchester United, they had a man sent off, and actually they all stayed almost to the end to applaud the team for the effort that they'd given, whereas you don't always get that in football stadiums. You don't have to be from the Basque Country to manage the team though. Howard Kendall famously managed Athletic Bill Bow, back in the 80s, he just won the title with Everton, 1987, then came and managed here, they finished fourth in his first season in charge, didn't last too much longer after that, Marcelo Bielse has been in charge here, took them to Europa League final in 2012, Esza plays a nice one to his Ubers, gets it back to the Spaniard, space on the right hand side for Madwake for the first time this evening, ball bounces in front of him, suddenly two red and white shirted defenders are there, he's going to take on Navarro into the penalty area, two of them wrestling and jostling there, it's cleared away only as far as Rice, Timber takes a touch and Yuki Williams is back, Timbers nicked it off him, this could be good for Arsenal, Madwake back to Esza, back to Esza and the shot just as he was about to hit it, got a sabre slid in, cleared the ball, Esza's accidentally kicked him, and that will be a free kick to Athletic Bill Bow, for a second there, Esza must have been thinking, I'm going to score. He's got an empty net, he's just put his head in his hands, he surely thinks he's going to score, Garazable comes from absolutely nowhere, the right back, that's much better from Arsenal, really good from Zubemendi, he spreads it wide to Madwake, the first time that Arsenal really got any kind of width, Madwake wins the ball, takes on his attacking fallback, takes Timber, their win possession, Madwake gets into the 18-yard box and he lays it square to Esza, and it's come into his right foot, goalkeeper's committed himself, Esza looks like he's going to tap it into an empty net, but the right back, Garazable pinches it off him at the last second. Still getting used to wearing glasses for football commentary pool, they do, when it's warm, they fog up. I'm still getting used to seeing you with them. Are you okay there, they are a bit steamy. It needs a bit of air con like in the car, I need to blast the windscreen here, the seam on, long clearance from the free kick, and it clears the entire Arsenal back line, and Beringere was the only one who kept running, and he's got this ball for Athletic Bilbao, wide on the left, Mosquera chases him up towards the halfway line, the pass hits Mosquera, goes out for a throw in, which Boiro will take, and it's played back into the athletic half, and the two centre backs will both get a touch, Paredes plays across to Danny Vivian, was the player sent off in the semi-final first leg against Manchester United last season, Manchester United came here, one really well, probably one of the best performances actually under Ruben Amarim, one three-heel in the first leg, Jaregita playing the ball through to Navarro, Gabriele is there, gets his body in the way, important challenge for Arsenal, then his clearance is blocked by Navarro, and goes behind for the goal kick, but there's definitely a threat from the home team. Yeah, super defended from Gabriele though, his positional awareness is excellent, and even when he does get caught out of position, he's got the pace and awareness to get back goal side, got him behind there, it was a ball, slipped down the side of him, very, very clever, opens his body up, gets his body between the goal and the attacker, Berenguer shields the ball, knows exactly where his opposing player is, turns around, plays it off him and gets a goal kick, really good experience, defending. That's one thing that Arsenal have been excellent at, isn't it, over the recent months, defending hasn't been their issue. Yeah. Marino has lost it just inside the athletic half, and then he's got his parades, onto the ball, in the red and white stripes forward, it comes here to Santhet, inside his own half, back to Viviane, Viviane gives it a, a good clump of a pass back to his goalkeeper, Simon. Simon looks left and looks right, two Arsenal players close enough there to put him under threat, so he plays a long one down the middle, and the Acce Williams runs here with Moschera, Canafiori not the friendliest pass back to Raya, who just cushions the volley away, Canafiori then thumps it downfield with his left foot, Rice has just knocked off balance there as he went for the header, it's got Scrappy again here, now Marino is going to try and do something, little ball over the top, I think the flag is going to stay down there for Yurkares, and here he comes, Arsenal centre forward into the penalty area, angles tight, straight at Simon, he got his angles right, he makes the save and the flag does stay down, and I think Boiro might have been playing him on. He was, it was Boiro who was looking over at the assistant on the far side, the left back, put his hand in the air, went on the offside, Supermendi just flicks a simple ball over the top, Marino actually is, there's a simple ball over the top for Yurkares, but he's got half a length of the pitch to run, he's not that type of striker who enjoys that. Supermendi with a heavy challenge, a clumsy challenge in midfield, Howdy Geetha goes down, free kick given to Athletic Bill Bow, 0-0 against Arsenal, going to say it again, Paul, Union Sanjidwa, they're still winning, 1-0 up, away to PSV Eindhoven, Conor McNamara and Chris Sutton with your commentary, Tottenham against Villareal this evening, advantage played here, Santhet bringing it forward dangerously for Athletic Bill Bow, he's turned Gabrielle, Gabrielle's held him up for now, Santhet holds onto it, just shy of the Arsenal penalty area, back to Gorisabel, short passing field from him, that is good work from Marino, just hassles Howdy Geetha out of possession, holds him off, looks for Yurkares, strength from Yurkares, does well to turn Vivian, and now Maduake is going to be interested in the middle here, if Yurkares can get the ball in, or will he go it alone into the penalty area? Lays it back to Ezra, Ezra across here to Zubemendi, Zubemendi turns, Jeers and whistles to try and distract Arsenal, as the attack builds, Timbers involved on the right, Deckham Rice back into the team this evening, still no Erdogan, no Sacken, no Havertz, no Jezus, no Ben White, yet for Arsenal, as Mosquera plays across to Maduake, he's made an excellent start to life as an Arsenal player, he's some really good football, he's played for England this season as well, Marino just inside that athletic build, Bauer Hall, to Ezra, Ezra in his bright orange boots is allowed to turn, just dangles his right foot in front of the ball, offers a dummy back to Gabrielle, wide it comes to Calafiori on the left, Calafiori shuffles in field, still going, good dribbling, Yurkares now lays it off to Zubemendi, Rice has it 30 yards out, plays to his right, Timbers cross, that looks like a good ball, Yurkares heads just wide, diving header bravely through himself at it, and I think it would have really fancied his chances of burying it, quick clearance from the goal kick, David Ryzen in a good position for Arsenal, because Iñaki Williams was racing onto that and Ryzen well out of his box, heads it away, Paul Robinson. Much better from Arsenal, they look so much better when they're trying to impose themselves rather than sitting deep and trying to nick possession back when they're in possession and they're asserting themselves onto the game, playing on the front foot, that's when they look a lot better, an earlier chance down the right-hand side from Madoeke, that time it was a wonderful ball into the box from Timber, and that's what they've been missing, a play like Yurkares throwing himself, old-style diving header goes really close. Yeah, I was thinking Keith Houch in 1987, that's the one isn't it, the classic, and it was like that, he really lost. But that's what they've missed Arsenal, we've talked so long about Arsenal missing, that number nine, but in Yurkares that looks like what they've got, I mean he's got three and four already this season, but that type of ball into the box, they haven't one been put in that type of ball into the box, or two had a player that would throw himself like that at it. Yeah, six goals and six champions league starts for Yurkares last season as well for Sporty, including a hat-trick against Manchester City, Madoeke, taking on Boyro, gets the cross in Wings Arsenal, a corner, first corner of the game for Arsenal, and we know the threat they pose from these, and this game has two to throw, because first ten minutes or so, Arsenal had a lot of the ball they looked in control, then Athletic Bilbao took over for a bit, it's a good old arm wrestle, David Ryan needs a drink, obviously racing out of his box to win the header, his thirsty work, so he's come to the edge of the pitch to collect that, Madoeke is taking his time here, ball tucked under his left arm. I think there's more to that for Ray, I think he's carrying some instructions, I think that's why Madoeke is delaying taking the corner. OK. And here it comes then, shortly from the right-hand side, after that it built down 0 Arsenal, 0, no, short one to Zuba Mendi, back to Madoeke, controls it, then crosses with his left boot, header off target, well off target from Moskera, might bounce to Ezra, Ezra does well, stretches out a right leg, controls the ball, takes it on the dribble down the right, challenge comes in from Iñaki Williams, and he knocks it out of play for a throw into Arsenal, down by the corner flag on the right-hand side, Timber as the ball above his head, thinks about going quickly, but Madoeke's got his back turn, so there's not an option to do that. I've let it build down 0 Arsenal, 0, Zuba Mendi has to stretch, couldn't find Califuri with the pass, Navarro's going to operate from deep here for Athletic, plays across to Gorisarbol, Ezra closes him down, that'll pass forward to Navarro, get a right little shimmy in front of the ball there, but it worked because he lost the attention of Marino, Vesga, short pass to his left to Boyro, and everything calms down, and Athletic Bilbao go at walking pace, so this is Arsenal's first game in the Champions League, next up is Olympiakos at home, and then Athletic home Madrid at home. Next couple coming Arsenal's way in this competition, as Paul said before the game, did really well in the league phase last season, six wins, one draw, one defeat, the only defeat away to Inter, Madoeke wants a free kick, thought he was hauled to the floor by Boyro, but to deal with Madoeke, Madoeke gets the decision. That's when Arsenal look better, they look better when there are strengths in the wide areas, when Madoeke are in a higher position rather than defending, Arsenal get the ball, push the two players wide, Madoeke's certainly a threat, I saw him for England in midweek, he was absolutely excellent, I think he was obviously the player of the game for me, I just think the impact he's had, I know there's a lot of Arsenal fans that weren't overly convinced when they signed him, I think that's a bit of an understatement in all honestly, but I think the freedom that he's got and the way that he's playing, and the way that Miquel Artheta's managing him, I think definitely in an England shirt, and you see in glimpses of it already in an Arsenal shirt. Declan Rice trying to make himself heard inside this cavernous stadium, shouting as he's about to take this free kick, which Madoeke won out on the right, Rice holds his left arm in the air, kills that in with his right foot, powerful header from Gabriele's off-target, well off-target, and I think he might have headed his own player as well, because two Arsenal players are down, and Gabriele is going to need some attention. Yorcares is the other. Yeah, there's a really well-worked set-players you would expect from Arsenal. Interesting that Athletic Club just held the line on the edge of the box, didn't pick up man-for-man, all the Arsenal players starting the group at the edge of the box, right at the back of the defensive line, and then they made a run individually, tried to break through the line, they ended up with a free header, Yorcares. Just watching the replay there. Yorcares and Gabriele, Yorcares has definitely come off the worst of the two, hasn't he? Gabriele is headed, Yorcares, he's headed the ball, and Yorcares, so the back of Yorcares' head has taken the full brunt of that. So slight stoppage in play, 15 minutes left in the first arc, you're listening to the Champions League on five live and BBC sounds, top them against Villarreal, there's our commentary at eight o'clock this evening, and Paul, you've spotted on the TV pictures here, blood streaming from Yorcares' head. Yeah, we're going to have a long break in play here. He's bent over and all forced, right over the penalty spot, he's got the physio on, won't be long before the doctor comes on, just seeing it close up on the screen, he's got blood trickling down the side of his face. Well, Yorcares not afraid to throw himself about, put himself in dangerous situations, has come closest in this first half with the diving header that was just off target, and at the moment receiving medical attention, so Mikhail Artejeda has a good chance here to get the tactical instructions onto the team. So yes, Tottenham Villarreal tonight, tomorrow night, Ian Dennis and Pat Nevin in Munich, for Bayern Munich against Chelsea, will have updates on Liverpool against Atletico, and on Thursday night, choice of listening, Champions League commentaries, Newcastle Barcelona on five live, John Murray will be at St James's Park, Manchester City against Napoli on Sports Extra, and then Sunday, I'm just going to flag this one up as well, Paul, because, I mean, Arsenal in a sense have a bit of an advantage this week, they play tonight, and Manchester City play Thursday, it's Arsenal, Manchester City on Sunday at half four, we've got full commentary on that one. It's a huge advantage, isn't it? I mean, Tuesday to Thursday, a big difference recovery, and obviously with the game being an early kickoff here this evening, the Arsenal players will jump on the plane as soon as they're finished, and more than likely we'll be back in London and back home before, what, 12, one o'clock. So maybe a morning off tomorrow morning to recover, and then a long time to prep, more than Manchester City get ahead of the game on Sunday. Jürkaer still receiving treatment, he's in a sort of praying position, he's on his knees, his back is straight, his head is bent forward, and they've got some tight black bandage wrapped tightly around his head, and that is a sharp haircut, that isn't it, Jürkaer? It's not going to be looking sharp after this though, is it? No, that's... What can we give our listeners an image, a Terry Butcher? Yeah, a little bit. It's a Terry Butcher, but it's black tape, black heavy tape, isn't it? And not, not, you know, oceans and oceans of blood, the famous picture of Terry after a game against Sweden. By the way, talking Terry Butcher, the other thing, because I love looking into the history of football clubs and stadiums, this is the new San Mamma Stadium, which was opened in 2013, the old one lasted for 100 years. If people like me, and I was a young kid at the time, I think I was nine years old, 1982, I came back from school, England against France, opening group game of the World Cup for England, in those fantastic England kits that I loved then. Throw in from Steve Coppel, 27 seconds into the game, Terry Butcher flick on, and an athletic Brian Robson left footed finish in the old San Mamma Stadium, England won the game by three goals to one, Robson got two, and Mariner got the other. That's one of my very first football memories, Paul. What year was that, 82? 82. That seemed a long time ago now, doesn't it? Those old kits that are now coming back and they're very cool to wear. England's women won the Euros this summer in something very similar, actually. Great kit there, his Sam there on the turn. Spinning high ball to the right to Gorisarble, Gorisarble plays it back to Navarra, handball! Says the referee, who is Donatas Romsas from Lithuania. What have you spotted, Paul? He's back on, Yorker is. Oh, yeah. He's back on, referee's just giving him permission to come back on. Heavily bandaged on this near side. So, free kick Arsenal, Gabrielle will take it. 11 minutes to the first half remaining, Athletic Bill bound 0, Arsenal 0. Steve Crossman back with us at half time. This is one thing that I've noticed, not just with Arsenal, but across the Premier League and leagues in Europe as well. They've got a free kick Arsenal, five yards outside their 18-yard box. There's no questions now, it's going long. They're going to put it in an area, they're going to be allowed to play in a certain area, but we're not going to put the ball at risk if we don't need to, it's going long. And they did that immediately from the kick-off as well. Do you know what, if Yorker has put a better touch on that ball and maybe still a little bit groggy after a whack on the head, he suddenly then would have had it just outside the Athletic Bill bow area with players running off him, so it worked. There's a lot to be said for doing things in one go rather than six or seven. Maybe more passes sometimes. You cause yourself more problems at times, playing in areas that you don't really need to. And like we say, we're seeing a big shift this year. Well, and that was really interesting actually. Michael Artheta was asked about that in the press conference yesterday as well, about the set pieces, the long throws, the longer balls from the back. And he basically said, you have got to be, you're going to win in the Premier League Champions League. You have got to be the best in every single department of the game. No stone unturned. Look at everything forensically. And that is how you win. And even then, obviously you might not because it's fine margins. But that's certainly what he does and what plenty of other football managers do as well. Ten minutes left in the first half, still 0-0, still a great noise inside the stadium. Calafiore fires a low pass back to Gabrielle, plays it across to Mosquera, the young Spaniard with the dark blue Arsenal shirt untucked, long sleeves. Here's Timber, Julian Timber across to Mosquera again. Mosquera forward to Rice, Rice under pressure from Santhet, who's chasing him across that Arsenal half. Wide to Timber, back again to Mosquera. Mosquera takes a couple of touches, looking for an avenue to pass into. There it is on the right. Timber then looks for the run of Madwake, and Madwake is pulled Boidrow back. And the two of them there, there was a bit of tugging, pulling and whatever. But eventually Madwake, not subtle enough, wasn't going to get to that ball. And it's a free kick for Athletic. It's a game very much being played in the middle of the pitch, isn't it? I mean, we talked about a couple of opportunities for either side, but there's been no real clear cut opportunities. Probably the best opportunity was Yorker as he's diving headed through himself at. But actually when you talk about Simon and Rea, we haven't really talked about them much, which tells you where the game's been played the majority of the time. Free kick then for Athletic Bill Bow, which Unai Simon will take. And again, it's going to go long because Athletic Bill Bow and the red and white vertical stripes have cleared their half. Simon goes directly from left to right across the pitch. Califuri nods it down, Ezra stretched, controlled it well, then tries to roll a pass down the left. Califuri will chase that. He won't get there, got a sabre, is there first and plays back to his goalkeeper. Doesn't look right, Yorkers. I mean, he's taken that blow to his head. He's got his head heavily strapped. There's a through ball there that he wasn't quite switched on. It's a little bit groggy to me. Interesting. The ball down the inside left channel for Athletic Bill Bow. And Yaki Williams goes tearing after it. Rea's there first, scoops it over his head, plays to Madwake. Madwake back here to Moschera. Rea under pressure this time. Low curling ball in between two Athletic Bill Bow players that were very close to him. Rice looking to win the ball in the half-way. He's on a yellow card. He's caught Garisable. It will be a free kick. And you can hear what the Athletic fans are trying to get across to the referee here. I don't think there's any malice in that for Declan Rice. He just late, just caught the player on his way through. But as you heard in the background, home support, they know exactly who's on a yellow card. Yeah, he was slightly late though, Declan Rice, looking at that. Got to be careful. Ball forward from the free kick. And also, they've caught sleep in there, bearing gear nearly got him, the offside flag is up. Doesn't matter because it ran through to David Rea, and he's bowled it out underarm this time to Timber. And Arsenal can start to play inside their own half. It's got to look this stadium as well from the outside. Modern stadium, big dome. Lots and lots of sort of triangular shaped panels, which obviously light up in the evening. You can sort of show all sorts of things on those. But I thought as we approach it today, it looked like you could actually stack a pack of cards in a stadium shape. It looks like loads of playing cards all stacked on top of each other. You've been trying to replicate it in your room this afternoon. Is that what you've been doing? You've not been doing your notes really? Absolutely no chance of that. This is one of those stadiums that if you like going around the world, around Europe, or in the UK, whatever, visiting football stadiums, this is one that you don't necessarily think of. But I've been here a couple of times before. This is an absolute must visit for the whole matchday experience, the build up, the city, the streets, the game. Just to see all these supporters in red and white and the noise. It's a great place, it really is. Tottenham fans, Paul's Old Club, a fond memories of course. This is where they beat Manchester United to win the Europa League final back in May. Arsenal playing out from inside their own half. Good pace and pass into the path of Madwake up against Boiro. Takes him on the outside, then checks for a second. Little flick of the ball into Berengea. Arsenal winner throw on the right. Six minutes for the first half remaining. Plus a little bit of added time. I think there's going to be a good four or five minutes of that, but it's a Yurka as a situation to the wild to deal with. Arsenal's biggest threat again, Madwake down the right-hand side. Been very, very narrow as he always tucks in. And actually the biggest threat has come when Timbers overlap to Madwake. He's on the ball. Arsenal have it on the right. That's Zubemendi, former Real Sociedad player. One of the big rivals here of Athletic Bilbao. As was Mikael Marino. There's Zubemendi. His little flick pass intercepted. Come on, Antonio Salabini. MC can drawann... Lord Gar herself has got it... an answer needless i' ko sw Chenatter 2, Arsenal on the left, Union, Sanjil, Yves got a second, Paul. PSV, Niel, USG. Two, maybe you've been seeing a lot more of them this season. But that was a great tackle by Eze, wasn't it? A real old-fashioned challenge. Certainly didn't expect him to leave the ground and put in a sliding challenge like that on Vivian. And Vivian certainly didn't like it. He's known for his robustness. He, in turn, returned the favour, didn't he, honestly? When you say Vivian, I mean, that's going to take me back to the 80s and the young ones as well. So there's all sorts of stuff ringing around my head here. Long throw into the penalty area, headed away by athletic Bill Bow. Califuri steps in to win it back for Arsenal, waits for the ball to drop, gets away from Vesca. Then the pass there is behind Zubemendi. And it was all a bit sort of scruffy after the set piece. Everyone was getting reorganised. Arsenal didn't really know what to do with that. And it's gone out for a throw-in to athletic Bill Bow. It's been a scruffy type of game. I mean, we're just passing the 41-minute mark now. No real team you could say is on top. As I said, it's played a lot in the middle of the park. But for Arsenal, it's job done. I mean, a draw here is not a disaster. A clean sheet will be important to them, as we know defensively, they're very good. But actually for them to be at this stage of the game, job done thus far. Here's Mabwaki, edge of the penalty area. Can it get better for Arsenal? Low shot block, ball spins out to Zubemendi. 30 yards out, sees Timber in space on his right. Timbers put the most dangerous cross of the game in in this first half. He's inside the penalty area now. Lays it out to the right to Mabwaki. Athletic Bill Bow defenders all in the line. 10 yards from their goal. Mabwaki twisting and turning. Cross comes in, hits the back of one of those defenders. How to geitha, bouncing ball. Clears it away with his right foot. Timber heads it in the air. Zubemendi wins the next header. Timber gets a touch on that, chases it down to the ball. And keeps it in and gets the cross in. This hurting self-doing that is down behind the dead ball line. Paredes just checks he's OK. Play's going to continue and Arsenal are down to 10 men. Really at the moment. Moskera's come across to the right back position. And Athletic Bill Bow spotted the weakness here. They're attacking down that left-hand side. And Nacky Williams sees the run of Behrangir. Into the penalty area, across the face of goal. And behind for the goal kick. David Ryad dives. He had that covered. There was one player, Athletic Bill Bow player. It was it's Santhe, racing through the middle, who was a couple of metres away from getting a right boot on that. They would have put it in the back of the net. Arsenal's point of view, Jury and Timber. He got himself injured by the corner flag and he stayed off the pitch. And immediately Athletic Club could see that weakness. And like you said, Moskera went over to the right back position. Paredes and Gehran, the end cuts inside and he shot. It's a cross, come shot, wasn't it? Sanse couldn't get on the end of it. David Ryad dived across but didn't save. That is definitely one, by the way. I've just thought for the glossary. For the commentators view, the great glossary of football commentary. The cross, come shot. Surely that is only football. That has to be. You must have had that by now. Here's Madwake. Dribbling again for Arsenal, taking on defenders into the athletic penalty area and then he's lost it and he's fouled his man. And that is going to be a free kick for the home team. We're into the 44th minute of an intriguing Champions League game. Arsenal knew it was going to be tough and it has been so far. And Athletic Bill Bowen-Neal, Arsenal, Neal, PSV, Neal, Ounee and Sanjid Wah, two. They're not going to have it all the way tonight, Arsenal. We knew that before the start of the game. Defensively very robust, as Bill Boweside. But what Arsenal have done, they haven't really come under any threat in the goal. On the two occasions they've had half chances at the home side. But nothing that's really threatened David Reyes' goal or forced him into any kind of action to make him at Neal, to make a save. They've kept everything fairly much in front of them. At times they haven't had possession, Arsenal. They've been comfortable in a defensive shape. You can see a couple of athletic fans just making their way back to their seats. They've beaten the crowds and she has got an enormous tub of popcorn. She's going to have to share some of that with the people sitting around her. Never going to be able to finish that. She sits down a few rows in front of us and the ball goes behind. No, it's a throw-in. The referee is saying that's a throw-in for Athletic Bill Bowes. And an attacking position wide on the left. Let it build down Neal. Arsenal, Neal. Stay in touch with the Champions League goings on this evening. Champions League final score available by the iPlayer website and app alongside our commentary. Just another way you can stay across everything while you're listening to us. Long throw into the Arsenal area. Mosquera heads it down and away, head to the box, right stretches and a sliding challenge on him. Turns into a shot on goal, really, from Danny Vivienne. It goes well wide at the target and behind for an Arsenal goal kick. They look to be comfortable defensively, Arsenal. They look to have it sussed out earlier in the game. Athletic Club were getting down the side of them at times. And you could see them just, you know, the two centre halves. Gabriella Mosquera just trying to work it out. But as the game's gone on, the threat from Athletic Club has become less and less. And the threats become less in wider areas. It's not coming down the middle in the width of the 18-yard box. The threat and the danger that they've had has been wider than the 18-yard box and has materialised in nothing. Three minutes of added time. We look down from our steepling commentary position here in the San Mamas Stadium in Bilbao. Let it Bilbao-nil, Arsenal-nil. Ryers goal kick headed forward by Santhe. Gabrielle powers ahead of down the left, over the head of Ezra. Challenge from Marino. That's a foul on Santhe, free kick for Athletic Bilbao. Did I just say three minutes of added time? You did. Yeah. OK. Good. And we've played 90 seconds of that. So Danny Vivian, who was the player sent off for Athletic Bilbao in that semi-final against Manchester United, the three-nil defeat, they then lost four-one-an-old Trafford. Manchester United got themselves through to that final, but couldn't get the job done in this stadium against Tottenham. Vivian takes the free kick forward. It's like Miss Q from Gabrielle on the clearance, still defending for Arsenal to do. Here's Navarro, who's got little blonde highlights at the front of his fringe, through the legs, cleverly, of Ryse there. And Yaki Williams, low ball, cross the face of goal. It's OK for Arsenal, runs through their penalty area. And Madueke collects it in the right back position, played to Marino, fell that touch on the edge of the box. Had to be good there. Forward to Yurkares, physical battle with Paredes. Paredes drags into the ground, free kick Arsenal. Timber takes it quickly. Madueke is away here, and the referee has said he'd play. Madueke pauses for a second there. He's now on the attack, arrowing into the box, looks for the cutback, last touch, came off the Arsenal player, cross-hit the defender, then hit Madueke, goes behind for the goal kick. Paredes is complaining that Arsenal shouldn't have been able to go with the quick free kick, and Unai Simon races out and says, look, don't get involved, it's fine. It's our goal kick. Well, they're quite happy now, because it's come to nothing, it's a goal kick. But they're absolutely raving. Vivian and Paredes immediately straight out to surround the referee. I don't know what the problem is, though. The free kick was given, nobody was within ten yards of the ball, there was nobody stopping the quick free kick. Timber saw that the free kick was on, he put Madueke in. Madueke actually half-stopped right, he said, didn't he? But then he realised he was through. There was no reason the referee should have stopped that. It was good, quick thinking by Arsenal. Red and white stripes bouncing in rhythm, and that two-tiered stand behind the goal away to our left, defended by the home team in the first half, let it build down, Arsenal nil. The Champions League this season underway, Gabrielle jumps, the ball comes off his forehead, goes behind him, but through to his goalkeeper, David Ryder. Half-time at PSV, two-nil down at home against Union Sanjou, the Belgians. Declan Rice on the ball for Arsenal, 20 seconds remaining in the first half, Yurka Rez is diving head-up, the closest Arsenal of Karn. Gabrielle tries to thread one through to Califari, intercepted, here's Navarro, brings it forward for Athletic Bill, Boul, lines up the shot, deflected, and behind it goes. For a late corner in the first half to the home team. Arsenal got to guard against his complacency, in very, very comfortable possession. Gabrielle, that time, looks to thread a ball into midfield, but he gives it away, gives the ball away really cheaply, shot deflected and away for a corner. Arsenal, just get concentration, keep clean sheets, don't cause yourself your own problems, which is what they did. Got to concentrate now, Arsenal. Last second to the first half, this is where the fans can make a real difference. Get those noise levels up, make it hard for the Arsenal players to think. Thunder clap begins around the stadium, nil-nil. Pace builds in the clapping, Beringer delivers the corner, near post, headed well wide at the target, and behind for the Arsenal goal kick, and as soon as the ball is back in play, I think, that is going to be the half time whistle. In fact, before David Ryde takes that goal kick, the referee does indeed say, that is it, for this evening so far. Half time in the San Memo Stadium, Paul Robinson, athletic Bill Bowen at Arsenal now. Without having a huge attacking threat, Arsenal have looked comfortable in the first half. I think Bill Bowe had the better of the earlier exchanges, created maybe one or two opportunities, but didn't really trouble David Ryde's goal. Defensively, Arsenal have showed up, they've kept possession. They've looked the... Sorry, athletic, they've looked the inferior opponent at times. Arsenal have looked stronger, they've looked dominant, and when they do look their best, is when they play forward and they play on the front foot. Madiwekey, again, for me, is the biggest threat. Eze needs to stay wider. In Yorker-ez, they've got a willing runner, but not giving him enough service. I think there's more to come from Arsenal. He won't be disappointed with Calarteta. Closest Arsenal have come, the Yorker-ez diving header from the Timber Cross. I'm going to go for intriguing tussle to sum it up. So far, half time, athletic Bill Bowen, nil. Arsenal, nil. I've got to say, Paul, I am amazed that Yorker-ez was able to continue after that knock, because it looked awful, didn't it? It didn't look great, and we're obviously sat right at the back at the stand here, at the very, very back. The top tier looking down, so the incident in itself looked bad enough. We've got a couple of replays on the small monitor, but obviously you've seen it closer up on the TV. We could just see the blood streaming down the side of his head. He went off the side of the pitch after a lot of treatment on the pitch, heavily bandaged. Stood on the near-touchline. He walked around halfway around the pitch, stood on the near-touchline in front of the dugout, and then was allowed to come back onto the pitch. And in all honesty, he didn't look himself. I mean, he looked bright, he looked sharp to start with, but since that knock on the head, there was a couple of times where I thought, you know, is he going to run through, and he kind of held his run. It looked like a heavy one. On Ezzer as well, it just got me thinking when I was listening to you there, wrapping up at half-time. In Martinelli, Arsenal have a player who wants to stay wide. Ezzer doesn't want to do that, does he? He wants to come back inside. So do you think Arsenal can find a way to make that work in the second half, or because it's a more natural fit in an Arteza system, does Ezzer need to change? No, I think he likes that because of the defensive way that Ezzer plays as well. He tooks in and it allows him to tuck in and drop in in the defensive shape. But all their threat has come from Adelwecki down the right-hand side. And naturally, when that happens, the whole team shift, and Ezzer at the edge of that team, he's naturally going to shift and tuck in, but actually in possession, they'll be better off doing, like what England did in midweek against Serbia, split and making the pitch really wide, get the wide players literally as wide as they possibly can. And that's where the threat's been for Arsenal. But for me, Ezzer is one, not done enough, and two, he just tracks inside all the time. He needs to find himself more space and get involved in the game. All right, you two, thank you very much for the time being. So, Athletic Club, nil, Arsenal, nil. I knew I was going to say that. As soon as I started saying, should we say, Athleticville bow? Anyway, it's goalless inside San Mames. We've got two Champions League commentaries for you tonight on Five Lives. So, coming up shortly, we'll make our first trip of the night to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs VRAL in full on Five Lives and BBC Sounds at eight o'clock this evening. We'll also get you round the three league cup ties tonight as well. We're at Brentford, Crystal Palace, and Sheffield Wednesday. And we've got more coming as well from the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. So, we'll do all of that before second half commentary after the news on Five Lives with Bethan Holmes. The Voice of the UK. This is BBC Radio Five Live. Thousands of people are attempting to flee Gaza City as the IDF launches a major ground offensive there. Israel claims it's a Hamas stronghold. That coincides with a finding by a UN commissioner of inquiry that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. The report found four out of the five genocidal acts have been carried out, which Israel rejects. Our diplomatic correspondent is Caroline Hawley. The UN Secretary-General has just said that it's not for him to determine legally if it's genocide, but he said the situation is horrendous and he said he couldn't remember such massive killing of civilians during the time he's done his job. So, I think this report will certainly add to the mounting condemnation of what Israel is doing in capitals right around the world, including many of Israel's Western allies. Elsewhere this evening, some of Hollywood's biggest names are paying tribute to Robert Redford, who's died at the age of 89. His co-star in Barefoot in the Park, James Fonda, says he was a beautiful person in every way. Here's our entertainment correspondent, Colin Patterson. When you look back at his career, it is that spell in the 1970s when he was the biggest movie star on the planet. He became the first person since Bing Crosby to have three films of his own in the top ten at the end of the year in 1974. What a movie star he was. Donald Trump is on his way to the UK. He's the first US president to be invited for a second state visit. The US president will spend tomorrow at Windsor Castle with the king and queen, and on Thursday he'll travel to the prime minister's country residence, Checkers. And as part of his visit, Mr Trump will be speaking about trade. But we now understand an expected deal to scrap tariffs on UK steel exports to the US has been put on hold indefinitely. British steel faces a 25% duty, which is half the rate put on other countries. Senior government sources say the UK steel industry still has a competitive edge. Well, let's have a look at the travel here, Zawna. Thanks, Beth Ann. So if we look at Cumbria first with the M6 and if you're heading north, T-bay at junction 38, that's where the motorway was closed this morning. Two lanes are still closed at the scene there. It's looking slow on the approach as well. The A56 in Lancashire heading north and approaching the M66 junction once. So that's the rum spot in junction. It's where it joins the A56 and it becomes that new route there heading north and heading towards the Burnley turnoff at Rottenstall. You've got it all blocked off to deal with an accident there. M5 Bristol Q's long delays Northman junction 15 joining the M4. That said, Almond's free with the Q's backing up to Cripps causeway junction 17. One lane still closed at the scene of the accident. M25 looking slow along the bottom at 7 near the M23 at the interchange. One lane closed for the repairs, queuing that to 8 at Rygate. And the M27 westbound junction 12 at Portsmouth. The scene of the accident still looking busy there. Q's backing up onto the A27 haven't bypassed and on the trains, no service.

Wake up with Five Live Breakfast, trim 6. And go home with Five Live Drive from 4. Weekdays on BBC Radio Five Live. This is Five Live Sports. The Champions League with Steve Crossman. Listen on BBC Sound. It is the first Champions League night of the season proper on Five Live and BBC Sound. Athletic Bill Bown Nill, Arsenal Nill at half time. Whilst you're listening, you can follow on with the conversation on the BBC Sport website as well. You can get involved there. You can get involved with us 85058 at Five Live Sport is how you do it. Right now on the live text page, I've just seen that the review of the first half is Nill Nill. I'll be honest, not a great watch. Which I think sums it up quite well. So if you head over to the BBC Sport website, you can follow with that. Full commentary to come as well on Spurs versus VRAL at 8. So we'll be inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Shortly, three games in the third round of the league cup tonight. Aston Villa, still looking for their first goal of the season who are at Brentford, who've scored in all five of their games so far. Chris Wise. And strangely, despite that, Villa have actually had more shots than Brentford in the Premier League this season. Second meeting in less than a month for these two as well. Brentford's one-nil win here was Keith Andrews' first victory since taking charge. But clearly, the inquisitive eyes are going to be on Unai Emery's team a sense that he might need to go strong in his team selection tonight, given their troubles in front of goal. Interestingly, Emery's actually only won one league cup game since his appointment just under three years ago at Villa. We're going to get the team news very shortly and we'll find out if we're going to see Jadon Sancho for the first time in a Villa shirt. That one's an eight o'clock kickoff and so is this one. Crystal Palace, of course, the FA Cup and Community Shield winners. They face Millwall, who last went beyond the third round of the league cup in 1995. Aaron Paul's at Selhurst. Yeah, and this one, Steve, needs no real introduction, does it with the last competitive meeting between Palace and Millwall, reigniting the vitriol in South London. Things have mellowed since both have their own individual focuses, but tonight's tyre first between the two in the EFL cup will no doubt be contested in a white hot heat atmosphere. The team news is yet to be released. We understand Walter Benitez will start in goal for Palace with Saar Walton and Anketia all expected to miss out. Millwall's scraped a draw down the road at Charlton on Saturday. Alex Neil will demand a better showing from his side who were poor. We go at eight o'clock under the lights at Selhurst. There's a 745 game as well. League two Grimsby town, you will remember, stunned Manchester United in the last round. So what can they do against championship struggle as Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough, Julia Boldt? Sheffield at Wednesday might be in crisis, but their own win over leads on penalties to reach this third round match. Did put some much needed positivity into the club. However, it is fair to say it's chaos behind the scenes here with some wages on paid, second from bottom in the championship and a transfer embargo. So again, the fans will protest against the ownership tonight with the majority of them boycotting the game. It means we'll have just 2000 home supporters here compared to around 5000 Grimsby fans. We do have the team news here now. Nine changes to the side that lost here at Hillsborough against Bristol City on Saturday. But after beating Manchester United, the visitors are brimming with confidence. It is two changes for them tonight, Rhys Staunton and Justin Amalzor, both come into the midfield. Thank you very much, Julia. So we'll be back in Bilbao shortly. Athletic Bilbao Nill, Arsenal Nill, half time in the Champions League. Then our second commentary of the evening is Spurs versus VRAL. Chris Sutton's at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It's an eight o'clock kickoff evening, Chris. Hello, Steve. Let's hope Conor McNamara's train hurries up. Otherwise, you'll be commentating as well. Well, yeah, that won't be a good listen. I don't think it'll be great. So let's pray for Conor. Yes, just get it, Conor. However you do it, trains, planes, automobiles. Just get to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, please. There's a lot going on. Not only is it Spurs' first Champions League much in two and a half years, it's the first full stop for Thomas Frank. It's the first since the end of the Daniel Levy era. There's a lot going on, basically. Yeah, and Justin is programme notes. Thomas Frank has talked about great pride in being a coach in the Champions League. First time, you're quite right. And just the importance of Tottenham getting off to a flying start. You get that first win on the board that gives them a real opportunity to build on that. It's been pretty seamless, really, the takeover from Thomas Frank. It's... He's felt, as far as I can see, very comfortable moving across London from Brentford to Tottenham. They've had a good start in the Premier League. Three wins out of four. And he's a manager, horses for courses, isn't he? He's adaptable, he will change up, as we saw in the Super Cup final against PSG, where they nearly got over the line, actually played very well in that. So it'll be interesting to see how he sets up, but they're up against a difficult opponent in Villarreal, who didn't have European football last season, but we know they're sort of pedigree in Europe over the years. You know, they can take a scalp or two. So, have you been impressed, then, with how they've looked? Because, like you said, they have got off to a good start, and results have been all right so far, certainly good. So, stylistically, are they more fun? I don't know whether they're more fun. I think that there was quite a ride under Angi Posta-Cogli, wasn't it, in last season? You know, the Premier League form wasn't good, but they ended up winning the Europa League. And Angi Posta-Cogli at the end of the season put all those eggs in the Europa League basket, ended up winning a trophy. Tottenham don't win trophies. There just seems to be an air of calmness, more calmness around the club. It's early days, as of yet, but you look at the result at the weekend against West Ham. You know, I think it was their first win in six years, something like that. It was extremely comfortable. And I've just seen Conor McNamara arriving. We don't need him, Chris. We're having a good time, aren't we? That's cheered me up, yeah. What do you mean, cheered you up? Yeah, well, that's cheered me up. You wouldn't want to listen to me all evening, Steve, on my own. But no, but just going back to Tottenham, it's been a really good start for Thomas Frank, and it would be even better if they could get a win tonight. I actually think the fixtures they've got in the Champions League are pretty OK. This is the one, isn't it, which on paper feels like a big night, if you like? Well, it is, because it's about getting a foothold, isn't it? Getting three points on the board, I don't know how many it'll be, to qualify, 10-11, whatever it is, but it gives them a great chance. I think they've got home games against Copenhagen, Slevear, Proud to come, games which you would expect Tottenham to have too much quality for those two teams. So, you know, an enormous game tonight for Thomas Frank, and, you know, first time in the Champions League. Also, Mike got a first sight of Randall Colomawani, who's quite an exciting signing, isn't he? I think he is, and he has plenty of Champions League experience with his previous clubs, Frankfurt and PSG and Juventus, I think 23 appearances in the Champions League. Tottenham have strength in depth, don't they, in those forward areas? I know Solanke doesn't look like he's fit this evening, but no, they have real strength in depth. You look at the bench at the weekend, you know, some of the players on the bench, Johnson, Audubair, you know, on the Colomawani, on there as well. So, you think Richardleisson, I don't know, they'll start this evening, I think the teams are out. But John, can I have a look at the teams? John, I'll just do Conor's job here. Go on, I mean, you're doing very well so far. Yeah, just doing Conor's job. So, yeah, well, Richardleisson starts tonight. So, Kudas, I can't see Colomawani though, so he must be on the bench then. Just John's just scrolling, he's on the bench, so a little bit disappointing. We built him up there and he's on the bench, but I'm sure he'll get some minutes. I think you're right, Chris, we need Conor back, don't we? Here he is. Here he is, just saying hello. Thank God. Good, listen, well done, because it sounds like you've had a nightmare, so well played. All good, all good. Excellent. Right, fine, well, we've run out of time now, Conor, but it's lovely to hear your voice. No problem. Chris has done a great job. Do you have the teams? Yeah, go on, if you've got a couple headlines. Two changes for Spurs, because Bentoncourt comes into the midfield and Rashardlison comes into the attack and they replace Joe Pelina and Matias Tell. What professionals? Thank you very much, U2. We're ready to go in Bill Bow, Ali. Thank you, Steve. Welcome back to the San Mamès Stadium. Listening to the dulcet tones of Chris Sutton just reminds me I was recording the FPL podcast from BBC Sport earlier on today with him. If you're a fantasy football fan, get your ears around that. It comes out every Wednesday. Chris and his team actually go in really well this season, no most seller in it, but he has got Erling Harland, who's been banging the goals for him. And we are waiting for the second half to get underway here in northern Spain. Halftime, Athletic Bill Bow, Niel Arsenal, Niel. There goes the whistle. Athletic Bill Bow will play from right to left in this second half. Their goalkeeper, Una Simone, is all in orange. The outfield players in the famous red and white stripes. Red panels on the backs with white numbers, black shorts and black socks. That's a shove in the back on Yurka Rez. And Yurka Rez is out there for Arsenal. Paul, we wondered, didn't we? Particularly after that knock he took to the back of the head late in the first half, and then he looked groggy after that, whether he might not return. But he is starting the second half for Arsenal. We did wonder, and I think it would be obviously very difficult to take him off from a manager's point of view as well. That number nine that they've talked about, he's come in, he's had such a good start. Here's Madueke on the right, crosses too close to Una Simone. He was looking for Yurka Rez, not the far post. Yurka Rez was lurking there, but he couldn't find him at the cross. Santheck nearly turns into trouble inside his own half. Good presence of mind and strength on the ball to hold onto it. Robert Navarro plays out to the right-hand side, to the right back, and Doni got a Sarbel. The athletic fans start up with a good old sing song at the start of the second half. Probably worth reminding you as well about this league phase and the Champions League. Second season of it, 36 teams. You play eight fixtures, which take you up to the end of January. The top eight go straight through to the last 16. If you finish between ninth and 24, you then go into a playoff game to try and get into that last 16. And anything below 24, 25 to 36, that is your European season over. I don't know what was more entertaining as scrambling around at the start of the season, trying to understand it, or sitting next to you, John and Ian, when the tables were going up and down towards the end of the league stages. Yeah, that is good fun to watch that happen. Great to be involved in. Here's Calafiore on the left for Arsenal. Esa, nice bit of skill fouled on the corner of the athletic Bilbao penalty area. Just too quick there. He went through the gap. Howard Eghitha stuck a leg out, and Esa has won an important free kick for Arsenal. And better already. Spoke about it a half time to Steve. Esa staying wider. That time he gets the ball, he gets possession. He tries to get around the outside, take his full back on, and as you say, wins a free kick in a really good position. It's actually Robert Navarro who caught him. Arsenal have got Ryring goal, Timber, Moschera, Gabrielle and Calafiore. Saliba is on the bench, so close to fitness, ready to be involved again. Rice on the yellow card, got that early in the game. Zubemendi, Merino is the midfield three, and Zubemendi and Merino, born in the Basque country, played their football here. They're all about playing here, and look at all those Arsenal players in the blue shirts. Four of them, cluster of them, lurking on the far right of the Athletic Bilbao area. The Athletic Bilbao defenders still steadfastly staying in the line. Then the Arsenal players move in the gaps in between them. Ball comes in, far post, headed down wide. Good chance, Yurkarez at the back post, got power on the header, didn't get the direction. That's a great chance for Arsenal. Best chance of the game, it's of course at Yurkarez at the far post. Simple set play once again, Declan Rice with the delivery. All four Arsenal players attacking the ball, starting the cluster at the back of the defensive line of the Athletic Bilbao players. They all break and try and breach that line. Yurkarez is the one that holds his run. He goes round the back, ends up with a free header. Almost inexplicably puts it wide. Amichela Teta's got his head in his hand. Got to be testing the goalkeeper there, he's got a header at the least, absolutely. He's a quality player, but he's a very good player in and around the box with his header as well. That was a free header from what, six yards out, granted it was on the angle. Didn't even hit the target. So good chance for Arsenal at the start of this second half. So it's Madwake and Eza, either side of Yurkarez, just to complete that Arsenal line-up. I'll give you the Athletic Bilbao team in a second. That's a complete miscue by Vivian. And then Paredes has panicked and bundled into Yurkarez. Doesn't get the free kick, actually. The ball's still high in the air. Then there is a foul committed on Inyaki Williams by Julian Timber. And so that will be a free kick for Athletic Bilbao. Unai Simon is their goalkeeper. And Doni Gorisabo, Danny Vivian, Aitor Paredes and Adama Boiro are the back four. The full backs this evening, both making their first start to the season. Gorisabo and Boiro. Mikhail Vesga has come into central midfield to partner the 21-year-old Mikhail Hauregitha. Inyaki Williams, Oyan Santhet, Robert Navarro. And Alex Berengue, make up the Athletic 11. They've got to throw five yards inside the Arsenal half on the right. Gorisabo throws it down hard into the turf and it skids to the feet of Vivian. Across to the other centre-back, Paredes, plays back to Simon. Marino is highest up the field for Arsenal there, puts the pressure on. Long ball downfield, headed away by Moskera, modded infield there by Vesga. Now, Yurka is going to chase a ball to the edge of the Athletic area. It was awkward there, bounced high and eventually volleyed away by Simon. Out for a throw to Arsenal, taken quickly. Timber into the feet of Marino to Madueke. Quickly gives it back to Marino, who dummies the cross with his right foot. Low ball with his left, looking for Timber, easily read, intercepted. And now, Athletic come on the break. Chance here, Navarro wants it played into his path. Santhet plays it to the left-hand side to Inyaki Williams. Slides a pass in down the left, Berengue gets there, slightly off balance. He's run that over the dead ball line, I think. Then he's caught by Gabrielle, picks himself up, goes down again and eventually it goes out for a throw-in to Arsenal. And Gabrielle celebrates the defensive work. He's just done for his team. Paul Robinson. A really good, quick, dissected break from the Athletic club players there. Really swift on the turnover of possession. I think he chose the wrong option. I think the better option was Grisabel on the right-hand side. The overlap was there, chose to pass it to this near side. To Inyaki Williams. Fought really hard for the ball. They thought they should have had a free kick on two occasions. Here they are again. Inyaki Williams tries to hit a curler from the edge of the penalty area. That's blocked. It comes back to Berengue. Berengue running with the ball at his feet. Lays it off here to Garisabel. Howard-Aguitha. Straight ball down the middle, down the channel. Good defensive work from Arsenal. There's Rice, passes it out to Ezra. That's intercepted by Vesga. Comes back to Ezra in the left-back position. Pauls rings around the stadium from the Athletic Bilbao fans again. You know what I'm saying in the first half? That you weren't able to support any other team if you lived in this city. Seeing someone wearing a Dennis Burr camp shirt in this stand. And the kid wearing a cold-parm-a-sher as well. So a couple of different bits of garb in and around us. Here's Yurkarez gets it out to Madwake. He got the pace here to go down the outside. Still Madwake, he pokes it towards the near post. It hits Simon, who had it covered, stuck out a left hand. And Arsenal go close again early in this second half. It's 0-0. He gets lucky there. Simon, the Athletic Good goalkeeper. Madwake once again does brilliantly. He gets all the way to the byline. I think he gets it a little bit wrong. He looks to play it across the six-yard box with the outside of his left boot. Actually, it's the inside of his left boot. Could have done Simon at his near post. Sticks a left hand out and gets lucky that he makes the block. Going to see the replay of it now. Madwake looking to score that first goal for Arsenal. Yeah, and Simon, you're absolutely right, Paul. Stuck out the big left hand. Paul just hit it and spun to safety. Cleared down the left-hand touch line by Boyerow. Throw in for Arsenal. Timber takes it early stages of the second half. Zubemendi, a couple of touches. Can't quite get the ball down. Controls it on his right thigh, passes it low to Timber. Two red and white shirted defenders in front of him. Tries to take them both on. He's tackled there. And Berengea is going to bring it away down the left. Foul by Zubemendi. He's broken the play-out early for Arsenal there. Conceded the free kick and Arsenal will back off. Talking about defenders doing fabulous bits of skill in the right wing position. Last season here, you saw Harry Maguire. Do you remember that bit of magic he did to create the... It was Casimiros' goal, I think, wasn't it? Casimiros' goal, yeah. It's been a good stadium for English teams, hasn't it? Obviously Manchester United come here and winning 3-0. Not so good for them the next time they turned up here, but Tottenham ended that 17-year trophy drought in this wonderful stadium. Free kick for Athletic. Athletic club, Athletic club of Bilbao. We must have said it ten different times. Simon, with his right foot. Can't get it right for everyone. That's the problem. Miss Q there from Madwake. Trying to hit it first time on the half folly. Howard Agitha, lobbed one forward. Moskera heads it away. Marino climbs highest. Heads it to his left, where he finds Ezzer. Ezzer back to Calafiori. Good start to the second half made by Arsenal. Change, kicked this evening. Dark blue shirts, red stripes down the arms. Looks like gold numbers on the back, actually. White shorts or grey shorts, I would say. Grey shorts and grey socks. And here's Gabrielle, the captain with the bright yellow. The captain's armband wrapped around his left bicep. Timber on the right-hand side. Max Dauman on the bench for Arsenal this evening. If he does get onto the pitch tonight, he'll become the youngest player ever to feature for Arsenal in European competition. Still 0-0, Calafiori stoopes, chest one down. Pass goes astray inside, the Arsenal half. Marino slides in, got the ball, says the referee. Had a good view of that. Zubemendi's there, plays it away to the right. And Madueke, one-on-one with Boyro. He'll fancy that, let it go bow, getting back in numbers there. Madueke stops, passes back to Timber behind him. He's a good outlet, Madueke. Every time that Arsenal turnover possession, they look to this right-hand side. But now, as they're on the ball, he is noticeably staying a lot wider. The pitch is a lot bigger, which is why Arsenal are dominating possession in the second half. They're able to stretch the pitch and the likes of Defton Rice, Zubemendi. Marino, they can dictate the pace of the game. Champions League football on five live and BBC sounds. Tottenham Villareal on the way in full, eight o'clock tonight. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, as they make their return to the competition under Thomas Frank, Conor McNamara and Chris Sutton, will be bringing you that one. All the other goals as they go in. Champions League final score tonight, available via the iPlayer website and app. So you can keep across it all. Good control by Timber, the pass was behind him. Looking for Madueke, Madueke. On the angle, nearly got the cut back to Yurka Rez. Foot stuck out by Vivian, blocked it. Cross comes in from Marino. Deep one, Rice is waiting at the far post. It doesn't quite reach him. Navarro controls it on the laces of his right boot. Calafiore is right behind him. Navarro's heading towards his own corner flag here. Got to be careful, turning. Clears with his right foot. Good pressure there, no foul. Arsenal get the throw. I'll tell you what, Yurka Rez is going to make a difference for Arsenal this season. Watching him now, he runs tirelessly. That run there that he was in behind, the ball in from Timber was actually meant for him. Came to Madueke, but it was Yurka Rez's run that caused the problems. They should have a foul there from Ezzar. Attack continues, here's Madueke onto the left foot. Once hit, the currently deflected Simon down quickly to his left hand side. That was sneaking in at the near post. Good save by the goalkeeper. Well again, Madueke on this right hand side. That time instead of going around the outside, he causes problems. Cuts in, goes across the 18-yard box, tries to fire it across Simon into the far right hand corner. Takes two deflections and was creeping in at the near post, but Simon was alert to it. Paul gave me this fantastic start ahead of this game, which I'd not seen. The Arsenal are trying to do something here, Paul, that no team has ever done in the history of the European Cup. And I'm going to allow you to deliver it when we get the next break in play. Califiori wins it for Arsenal inside his own half. Zubemendi gets the move in quickly. Diagonal to Madueke, seeing more of the ball in this second half. Madueke running at Boiro, two defenders there. They can't deal with him at the moment. Then Boiro does well. Watches the ball, gets a left foot on it. Madueke's tackled, and Boiro is able to bring it away down the left pass-up. Towards Santhe, he couldn't control it. It's gone out for a throw-in to Arsenal, which Timber takes. Timber throws back to Mosquera. Mosquera passes to Declan Rice. Rice inside his own half, forwards to Zubemendi, who looks busy. Always tackled there. Santhe charging forward for Athletic. Great support on the right-hand side from Inaki Williams. Into the Arsenal penalty area, onto that left foot. Shops on to the right, hits the shot. Easy save for Raya. Low down to his left. This game is certainly livening up. Certainly opening up, and that's tacked to Arsenal. Been a little bit more proactive playing on the front foot, but in turn they've left itself a little bit more exposed. Inaki Williams, that time it was on the right-hand side. He gets his shot on his right foot, on an angle from about 12 yards. David Rea, perfectly positioned, had his angles absolutely such the perfection. Went down to his near post and made a comfortable save. But the first real save that Rea has had to make. How could it build down 0, Arsenal 0? Ernesto Valverde, the 61-year-old in charge of Athletic. In the black T-shirt, black trousers and trainers this evening. Out on the edge of the pitch, trying to get some instructions across to his players. Mosqueda walking pace inside his own half. Low little pass to his right to Zubemendi, across to Timber. Some of the subs are getting a shout here for Athletic. So I think they're about to make at least one change. Timber gets the ball on the right. When they do make that change, that'll be the time for Paul's killer stat. I tell you what, you're bigging it up, but I've just had to quickly go back through my WhatsApp messages. Because I deleted it once I sent you it. I thought that's a you stat, not me. OK, I've got it. I've got it if you need it. I think you'll remember it. Here's Rice up towards Timber. Good turn inside the Athletic Bill Bauham. That's a ridiculous foul from Paradeys. Grabbed him with both arms, slung him left-right, left again, threw him to the floor and then looks at the referee and says, how's that free kick? Well, it is. Definitely a free kick there. Almost manhandled him there inside his own half. Arsenal growing in confidence as the game goes. They'll take more and more chances going forward. Defensively solid, but they will put free kicks forward. Ida Wecky once again on the ball on this right-hand side. Yeah, he's looked a real threat for Arsenal in this second half. Teasing Boiro this time. Dummies the cross with the left foot back onto that left foot. Here's Rice. Receives the low pass from Madueke back to Zubemendi across to Gabrielle. Gabrielle's 40 yards out inside left channel. Ezzer tackled. The move loses a little bit of momentum, but Gabrielle picks it up again. Passes into the centre-circle to find Zubemendi. Cross to Mosquera. Unai Gomez is waiting to come on and attacking midfielder for Athletic. A lot of Arsenal possession at the moment. Here's Mosquera. Coming up to an hour played in the game. Athletic Bill Bauham, Arsenal 0. A few more raucous singing and chanting from these fabulous home fans. Ezzer, diagonal ball left to right. Finds Madueke, kills it, stone dead first touch. Little trick, right foot down by the bar, and dinks the cross straight into the arms of Simon. That's the first thing he's got wrong tonight, Madueke. Did everything right, controlled it with the outside of his left foot, went round the outside, and then looks to pull the cross across the edge of the six-yard box. He just dinks it harmlessly into the goalkeeper's arms. Simon, having caught it, went quickly with the clearance. And it looked to be a one-on-one between Inyaki Williams and Mosquera, and the Athletic fans are complaining they felt Mosquera was holding Inyaki Williams back, to be honest. Six to one, half a dozen of the other. So, Unai Gomez is coming on for Robert Navarro. So, Arsenal this evening, Paul, are trying to do something no other team has done in the history of the European Cup Champions League, which is... Well, the longer it goes without them scoring, they're getting further away from it. But should they win tonight, they'll become the first side to ever beat Spanish teams, six games in a row in the European Cup and Champions League. So, basically, the whole history of the competition. Having taken down Real Madrid twice, Seville twice, and Girona. That'll be six. Competition first. Yeah, Real Madrid last season in the quarter-finals, Sevilla, home and away, group stages the year before that. Girona last season as well. That's the five. Six wins in a row would be a first ever in the history of this grand old competition. Michel Arteta's not bothered about that. He wants three points. At the very least, one point. This game is well balanced. Calafiore plays back to Raya, all in green. The Arsenal keeper, the Spaniard, Mosquera. Another Spaniard out to Timber in the right back position. Chase back by Gomez. Home fans love that. Oh, great run from Timber. Flicks it over Boyro. Paredes comes across. Has a hack in it. That turns into a decent pass here for Gomez. Curly here, bouncing on top of his head, plays it to Boyro, continues his run on the left. Good block by Mosquera. Mosquera muscles him off the ball as well, passes down the right to Timber, lay off here to Medwake. Sliding challenge, important one from Jada Geitha. The fans are on their feet. And look at that response there between player and fans. Again, all as one. Fantastic. It's become a lot more open the game now. Arsenal taking chances in the final third. Looking to move the ball forward. Homeside sense in that. Both teams at the moment looking to win the game. What a point in the game where there's an opportunity now to go on. Neither side are really thinking about a point at this stage, both wanting to take all three. Giant flags flying in the home end away to our left. Athletic Bilbao intercept, break up an Arsenal attack. Pass forward, no good. Gabrielle is there into the last half hour of the game. Arsenal yet to make a change. Calafiore's got space to work with on the left. Ezzer, edge of the penalty area, trying to make himself available. They're going to switch left to right again. Look for the danger man, Manuweke. Ball bounces in front of him. He leaps high, controls it athletically, rolls it back into the path of Timber, onto his right foot, stands the cross up into the box. Ezzer trying to get on the end of it. Beaten to that, header finds Zubemendi. A clearing header now. Calafiore, pace across, block. Will go straight up in the air. Vivian gives Garosarba a shout. Garosarba ducks. Vivian volleys the ball away. And Arsenal are about to bring Leandro Trossard into the game. He's taken a big slug of water from a bottle, as Mikael Arter has his left arm around the Belgian shoulder. Gives him the last instructions in his shell-like, and then gives his hair a good old ruffle for good measure. Timber, that was a foul on Sam Thet, but advantage play. Gomez is all on his own here, for athletics, so he's just got to hold onto the ball, keeps possession, plays back into his own half, 0-0. Look sharp, Gomez, since he's come on on this left-hand side, in place of Navarro. Navarro tended to drift inside a lot. But Gomez has come on defensively, as it shirks his duties, made one or two good tackles. His first thought every single time is to get past Timber. This caused Timber a problem since he's come on the field. PSV, Niel, Union, Sanjilwa, 2. Tottenham Villareal commentary on the way this evening at 8 o'clock. Tomorrow night we're in Munich, for Bayern Munich against Chelsea. We'll have updates on Liverpool, Atletico. The highlight show, BBC One, tomorrow night at 10.40. And BBC Two, 11 o'clock, where they have highlights in Newcastle, Barcelona and Manchester City, Napoli, both of which you can hear as commentaries on the BBC's sounds. Newcastle on five-lie. And Manchester City on the sports extra. Good chasing down the left by Yorcarez. Again, Tylus Workpool to win a throw in for Arsenal. I really like what I see with Yorcarez. I think he'll be a real asset to Arsenal this season. I've already scored his goals, like I said, three and four this season. Got that head injury, though. It's looking like that might be his last act to the evening. Yeah, Yorcarez coming off. Just had the attendance in. Just over 51,000. 2,700 Arsenal fans up high, away to our right. Yorcarez off. Trossard on for Arsenal with 25 minutes left to play. Game is still 0-0. Giant banner was unfilled before the game. Written in big block capitals in Spanish, which our producer, George, thankfully, had translated for me. Has it taken him this long? Just 16 runs to the get. Throw into the near post now. That's unfair. He passed it to me right at the start. Marino is going to chase the ball here in the penalty area. Parade is nipped in. What a really important header for Athletic. It's cleared away an out for an Arsenal throw. It just read, we will be by your side until the last day. And that drop down from in between those two tears away to our left. Another couple of changes coming for Athletic. But here are Arsenal with Ezzar. Ezzar stands the ball up to the far left. Marino's header, Seymour makes the say. Marino was stretching. He was trying to direct it back to where it was coming from. Couldn't get the power or the placement. It's half a chance for Arsenal. It's a ball from the left-hand side from Ezzar. First time he's really got round his fullback and attacked his fullback in the game. Stands up a good cross. It's just a little bit behind Marino. Stretching, reaching, but managed to get some kind of purchase on it. But harmlessly into the goalkeeper's arms. Athletic, nil. Arsenal, nil in the Champions League. And the Ackie Williams, chess it down. Plays back into his own half to Vivian. Vivian again on the ball. Rolls his pass low to Paredes, the other centre-back. Back to the goalkeeper, Seymour, and all in light orange. Timber heads it away. McWakie, flicks the head around the corner for Marino to chase. Marino then has to block that pass forward down the left-hand side from Paredes. And it goes out for a throw. So, striker Gorka Gurutheta is about to come on for Athletic Bill Bauer. And also left-back Yuri Berchicce. Surprised he didn't start, actually. Berchicce is a real attacking threat. I think that might be what the manager's thinking. Throw in for Athletic. Gomez flicks the header behind him. Mosquera is there for Arsenal. Christian Norgaard, by the way, is on the bench for Arsenal tonight. Yet to feature for the club since joining from Brentford in the summer. And Pierre-Oim Capier, as well, yet to make his debut. The Ecuadorian defender was on loan from Bayer Leibicouz. And he is also on the bench this evening. Timber carries the ball up to the halfway line for Arsenal. Back to Zubemendi, passes it to Mosquera across to Gabrielle. Gabrielle trucks forward. Garen Gair gets in his way. And Gavriel panicked a little bit there, just sort of ran into Garen Gair. And found him. And that's going to be a free kick. It's either a free kick for Athletic or a throw in on the right. Gabrielle certainly had the last touch. Right, change is coming. Oyan Santhet, attacking midfielder is coming off to be replaced by Gurutheta. And the other change is left back for left back. So yes, Boyro comes off, who started the seedling. And Berchicce comes on. The interesting to see what he does now, because I think this will be a little bit of a shuffle of the puck. Garen Gair has played as a number nine alongside Williams. You know what the home fans think of that immediately. Gurutheta goes up there. Straight down the middle, just having a quick look now. So Berchicce has gone to the right. Garen Gair off him, you think, maybe. Yeah, Garen Gair's playing in the number 10 role. Williams out to the right. And Gomez on the left-hand side. Slight change in formation. Mosquera wins a header on the halfway line. Marino's pass for his block. Garen Gair in that number 10 role onto the ball quickly. He finds in the Acce Williams. He's got Calafuri backpedaling. Turns to his left, then to his right. Calafuri sticks out a leg, tries to block the cross. Headed away by Gabrielle. Howard-Aguitha outnumbered on the edge of the box. Ezra and Calafuri player 1-2 back to Ezra. He's lost it. Trossard steps in. Trossard dribbling into danger. Definitely fouled on the edge of the box. Referee spotted that. Will be a free kick. And the Acce Williams hits the shot anyway. And Raya tips it over the bar, but Arstel get the free kick. So Marino for Arstel now. Further forward, Paul with Trossard. Sort of midfield. Dropped away in behind. Trossard will be slightly more advanced than Marino. Well, Trossard at the moment is going to receive treatment on the edge of his own 18-yard box. They've interchanged. It's kind of a false nine, really, isn't it? I mean, you see Marino now, he's anchoring in that midfield role. So when Trossard does get up, he'll be the most advanced player. But the interesting one, the changes from Ernesto Valverde, the athletic manager. You look at their draw, he's thinking, right, it's nil-nil here. I've got 20 minutes to go. Throw caution to the wind. This home form could be important to get out the league base. I mean, they've got PSG at home. They go to Dortmund. They've got Atlanta, Atlanta away. They play sport in here. They go to Slavia Prague. They've got Karabag at home. And then they go to St James's Park. So this form here and getting the result here, I think he's going for three points here. Beringa and Gomez just make a bit of a mess of an attacking opportunity for Athletic there. The ball is back with Raya. Raya saw the pass and then whips it perfectly into the feet of Timber. Timber's in the right back position. Plays further back to Mosquera. Mosquera's done really well for Arsenal. 21 years old, first appearance in the Champions League, has settled in very nicely. Having signed from Valencia. Rice carries the ball forward to the halfway line. Chips it down the left. Nearly a mess up on the edge of the penalty area between Seaman and Paredes. Paredes sliding in, clears the ball away. Arsenal come again with Ezzer. They'll drop with the shoulder. Glides past a couple of defenders. Still going, Ezzer feeds it forward to Trossard. Trossard edge of the area, trying to wriggle into space to tee himself up for a shot and the referee's given a free kick against him for an arm which has come out and caught one of the Athletic players, Vivian, in the face. He's clever, Vivian. He's an experienced defender. 26-year-old Spaniard knows exactly what he's doing. Trossard looked like he'd got the better of him. There was a flailing arm. Vivian made it look a lot worse than it was. Right, another change coming for Arsenal. Ezzer coming off. 20 minutes to play. First Champions League game for him. Never really got into it this evening. It is going to take a bit of time. Looks slightly frustrated as he comes off. Martin Ellie comes off. I'm not surprised with that change. I think he's been poor tonight, Ezzer. He's come inside far too much rather than taking on this fallback, getting around the outside, putting crosses into the box. I think it's been a quiet game for him. They've played a lot dominantly down the right-hand side because of the quality of Madu Ecke. All the reaction to tonight's football in the Football Daily podcast for you later on this evening. There for your first thing every morning. BBC Sounds app Trossard flicks it forward. Martin Ellie first touch, heads it down. Oh, brings it on. Martin Ellie, clean through on goal. One-on-one, right footed under the keeper. And Martin Ellie is on and scores immediate impact from the Arsenal substitute. He had the pace to get away, but he had the cool head as well when the chance presented itself. Slid it under the keeper with his right foot. And Arsenal's Champions League campaign is up and running. Athletic Bill Balneal, Arsenal won. Well, there he is, the super-sup. Miquel Arteta, you can praise him for his proactive change there. Martin Ellie with his first touches of the game. Runs through from midway and through the opposition's half. Goes through one-on-one with the goalkeeper. It's not the most convincing of attempts to save it from Simon. Goes underneath the athletic goalkeeper, but it's brilliant from Arsenal. It's a simple ball over the top into Martin Ellie. His first touch is good. His second touch is even better. Comes from an athletic goal kick that's headed back down the field. Arsenal turned defence into attack with two headers, helped over the top. Really quick thinking by Drossard into the path of Martin Ellie. His second touch is absolutely superb. Takes it away from the unrushing defenders, opens himself up, almost telegraphs it with his right foot. Looks to go across Simon. It's not the greatest of finishes. It goes right underneath the goalkeeper, but he won't care. Talking about squad strength and options, Paul, Ezra off, Martin Ellie on, they offer different things. Martin Ellie has that quick silver pace, and he was perfect for that situation. He was so sharp, so quick alert to the situation, and you've got to give him a lot of credit for being that ready coming off the bench. That wasn't just a snapshot, a goal with his first touch. That was two touches on the halfway line, a run half a length of the field and a finish. Superb attitude to come off the bench and do that. Yeah, under pressure from the defender as well, and he very nearly with one of the touches didn't get it past him, but kept his head and just managed to squeeze the shot under the body of Unai Simon. First goal of the season for Gabrielle Martin Ellie, as it stands Arsenal heading for three points in their first Champions League outing of the season. As I said at the start as well, only three English teams, two English teams have beg your pardon, but one in Bilbao against Athletic in European competition, Manchester United last season, 3-0, Europa League semi-final. And that great Liverpool team back in the early 80s, so Arsenal trying to become the third. Gabrielle to Cala Fiori, intercepted by Garas Sable. Athletic really have to come at Arsenal now, which may open further opportunities for Michel Arteta's team. Paredes in the centre circle, lofted ball down the middle of the pitch, bounces once inside the Arsenal area, and David Ryder chests it down. So just over 15 minutes to play, Athletic Bill Barnell, Arsenal won, and O'Neill Sanjianouar still turning up away to PSV Eindhoven. It's not been the most fluid and the most prettiest of performances, but it's been a job well done at the moment for Michel Arteta in his Arsenal team. You can see the way that they set up, they battled and they scrapped in the first half, they saw it through, they've kept a clean sheet, they've got their goal away from home, and as you say now, Athletic have got to come out, and that might suit Arsenal with the pace that they've got on the pitch and Martin Ellie, Trossard and Maddoeki especially on this right-hand side. At the moment, it's a typical away performance, isn't it? Sends an extra urgency for Athletic Bill Barnell. Don't forget Arsenal have only conceded the one goal so far this season, that was the stunning Sobberslide three-kick, but that's a foul I think by Moskera, inside the Athletic Bill Barnell half, eager to win the ball back to get Arsenal on the front foot, but he's just been a little too enthusiastic in the challenge, so that'll be a free kick. So just about 15 minutes to play, Arsenal are one up in a course, their next game, home against Manchester City, massive game on Sunday, we've got commentary of it on Five Live, and BBC Sound, I'll let it Bill Barnell get the game underway again. Paul Robinson here, in the San Mames, watching with us has got a sabre, stocky little right back, four Athletic, plays it back to Vivian, into the midfield, Vesca back to the goalkeeper, Simon, Simon chips it down the middle of the pitch, Gabrielle wins the header, and he's got the pace again, nearly gets there ahead of Khaled Agatha, he did well to bump him off the ball, and also plays a good pass down the right and got a sabre, the right back is flying forward, danger for Arsenal here, Calafiore shuts it down, gets his body in the way, makes the block, throw in for Athletic. Defended very well in those areas, Arsenal, Calafiore that time, they do took in narrows a back ball when they're at possession, but when the need to, Calafiore reads the game really well, goes out to the full, that closes the ball down, and makes the block, it's about concentration now for Arsenal, seeing the job through. David Reyes' goal has not really come under much threat, defensively they've been very good. Throw in now that Arsenal have to defend, aim towards the penalty spot, Gabrielle heads it away, right footed shot is driven low, Marino makes the block, played back there by Guruthayton, other cross comes into the area, header from Gomez, straight at Ryder, easy save, clash of heads again, we're going to get another stoppage in play, Athletic Bill Bowneal, Arsenal won, and David Ryder is trying to get the medical staff to hurry up here, since there's some urgency there, Marino is there, more blood? Not sure. Still waiting on the blood camp, it's not zoomed in enough yet, but they were pretty adamant to get the doctors and physios on, look to nasty clash of heads, but again it's good defending from Arsenal, yes there's been a header on the goal, but the header on goal has come from 16-17 yards out, the cross came into the box, didn't really have any pace on it, the header came in and it's just a simple catch for David Reyes, it was an opportunity, it was a chance, but it's from distance, I mean I could still catch a ball from a header from that distance, now I fancy the chances. While we wait for the players to receive treatment here, Paul, just talk to me about Simon and the goal he conceded, Spain's number one there, Martinelli is racing through in the one-on-one, and it's one where you look at it, it's quite close to him, but it sort of sneaks underneath him between left hand and left leg, is that an awkward one where that ended up for him? That's exactly what we talk about all the time, don't we? We talk about it quite often when goal's going, just down by the side of goalkeeper's feet, I mean we see a lot of goalkeepers now making blocks with their feet, and that's something that they practice in training, something that we never used to practice, it was always get down, get your hands to it, and your natural instinct as a goalkeeper is to get down, get your hands to it, but actually when you talk to strikers and you listen to strikers in the way that they're coached, that's the place that they look. Now I don't think for one minute that's what Martinelli meant to do, because he opened himself up and looked to go around Simon, he actually didn't quite get his shot and it went right in between, well you can imagine yourself standing, if you want to put your left hand down on the ground, between your foot and the ground, that's exactly where the ball went through. Difficult place, but the goalkeeper could have made it easier just by booting the ball away, but that's technically not what you taught and technically not correct. So the athletic Bill Bow player who took a whack to the head here is up and on his feet, and he's holding a bandage addressing a cover, a white cover to his left cheek, that is the substitute Unaid Gomez who's slowly making his way back towards the half way line to try and get himself back into the action when we get back under way. Marino, slightly concerningly for Arsenal, is still flat on his back, I mean he's not out cold because he's been talking to the Arsenal medical staff and they're now hauling him up into a sitting position, but they've been taking their time quite rightly as well, any clasher heads, any banger heads. Just getting to look at the incident again, it was Marino who was going forward onto the ball, substitute Gomez was in front of him, he tried to flick it on, but as he flipped it on, Marino got the whole load of blonde hair and head right in front of his nose and teeth, painful one for Marino. Right, 12 minutes left of this game, plus a fair bit of added time now, Marino's OK, up and moving for Arsenal, he is now just breaking into a gentle jog down behind the dead ball line away to our left, David Ryder has the ball at his feet, Oonion Sanjiraba third goal, debuting the Champions League away from home in their first game, and they're 3-0 up the way to PSV, we've got commentary of Tottenham VRAL to come tonight, from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and we'll keep you updated on Ray on the grid at home to Marseille, the event is at home to Borussia Dortmund and Benfica, Houston Karabag, Unai Gomez is going to have to come off, so he walked back towards the half-way line, he's gone and sat straight down in the dugout, Athletic are about to make a couple of changes here, I can see Sub's getting ready to go, one of them is Alejandro Rego, the other one is Nico Serrano, here's Iñaki Williams, tries something very audacious from the angle, 30 yards out and has accidentally kicked Califiore, and now Iñaki Williams claims that Califiore is making a meal of it, and Arsenal are trying to run the clock down, Califiore does seem in some pain, the referee doesn't seem too fussed about it, he's telling Ryder just to stay where you are, keep the ball, come on let's get this game going again, and Athletic wait to make the double change, but this is what it's all about as well isn't it Paul, you know Michel Arteta was asked a lot of this last night, about the experience, and Pep Guardiola always said that about Manchester City and the Champions League, you have to have season after season after season, of experience, of these stadiums, of these trips, of these big games, as Athletic make one of these changes right now, so Gomez is coming off, is already off receiving treatment in the dugout, and Vesga is the other one to come off Serrano and Rego, but that's what they were asking Paul about, the experience Arsenal have, and the strength and depth they now have, where effectively lost and they sort of ran out of players almost. And this is the first Champions League game of the season, this is something that they're going to have to manage throughout the whole season, competing on both fronts as we've seen, we've seen them fall away, both in Europe and domestically, and that's it now for Michel Arteta, it's become the time where you've had the summer, you've spent 250 million, you look at the players that you brought in, you've got two players in every single position, now the time for potential, it's time to turn that expectation and potential into actually delivering something, and you say the experience and everything will stand these players in great stead, it's come into places like this, it might not be pretty, this hasn't been the best ever Arsenal performance, but you're looking at the score sheet, there's no pitches on the score sheet, it says 1-0 and at the moment they've got three points. Martin Ali's goal in the 72nd minute, David Ryder, clears the ball downfield from the free kick, Trossard wins the header, volleyed away by Parades, and Jacqui-Williams will chase that, Mosquera heads it back towards Ryder, Ryder's not really there yet to come racing across from the left-hand side of the field, got there, slices the clearance away, that was brought down brilliantly by Beringer, knocks it past Timber, Timber will beat him to the ball, and play it back to Mosquera again, Mosquera, edge of his own penalty area, never flustered, Trossard tries to turn it quickly around the corner, runs to Madwake, Madwake keeps the ball in play, but can't find his teammate Zuba Mendi, and Danny Vivian passes back to Unai Simon, 80s references all over the place this evening, Ounion Sanshiloise, third goal has been scored by Kevin McAllister, brother of Alexis, producer George Wright's not a home-alone character, good line by that George, eight minutes plus, that is time remaining, Arsenal leading 1-0, Beringer, holding off Marino, Bericiccio plays the ball down the left-hand side, Beringer, all over the back of Mosquera, wrestles him to the floor, that is going to be a free kick for Arsenal, and you can see now, the athletic Bill Bowes players are getting frustrated, desperately trying to make something happen, and Arsenal are just killing the game. He's going to be a good player, you know, that Mosquera, he's going to be a really astute sign, 21 years old, I think he'll have to pay for him 15 million, but I think he's going to be a really clever, clever acquisition, sitting in there like he's played there for years, alongside Gabriel this evening, looks very experienced, and just that incident there, running the game down, knowing when and where to win a free kick, slow the game down, and break the play-up. Trossard's down on the floor, challenging for a high ball inside the athletic half, goes back into the Arsenal half, Ryre is there, 10 yards outside his penalty area, long spinning clearance downfield, headed away over the head of Madwake, Altezza looking slightly anxious there, pleased with the challenge from Merino to win the ball, lovely pass for the outside of his left foot, to find Trossard, who looked for the early cross to the far post, towards Martinelli, blocked, and behind it goes for the corner, league cup commentaries tonight, so in 15 minutes time, Sheffield, Wednesday Grimsby, gets underway on Sports Extra, 8 o'clock kick-offs, Brentford Villa is on Sports Extra 2, Palace Millwall on Sports Extra 3, and if you're enjoying the coverage on the World Athletics Championships, big race tomorrow, 2.20, will come into five live live from Tokyo, the men's 1500 metre final, three bricks in that, Josh Kerr, Jake Whiteman, and Neil Gauley, World Athletics on BBC Two from 11 in the morning, and then in the afternoon on BBC One from 2 o'clock. Athletic fans now, oh, Yellow Card, for Madwake was it for Deleu, in the take-in of the corner? I think it's Madwake who's been booked there. Now waits to take the corner away to our right, referee's still not happy, because he's spotted some pushing and shoving from young Moschera inside the six-yard box, Arsenal happy with the time ticking away, six minutes plus added time to go, now Madwake takes it with his left foot into the far post, Gabrielle's down inside the box, not before by Supermendi, Calafiori has a strike at the ball, didn't get much on it, break on for Athletic, and here's the man they want to have the ball as well, it's Iñaki Williams, moving at high speed down the inside left channel, infield onto his right foot, the ball hits the back of Supermendi, Bettinger turns, but turns into trouble, Declan Rice strides away, imposing figure, chased by Haudegy through, holds him up, Rice holds him up, the referee says that's actually a foul on Declan Rice, and Arsenal celebrate the award The locals are not happy with that decision, do you know what, you can kind of understand it, because the referees let things similar go, what Arsenal players have committed, and actually they're deep in his own half, Declan Rice knew what he was doing, drew the foul, referee immediately gave the free kick, home support there, as you can hear, felt that they should have potentially had more free kicks for similar offenses, let's say. Paul Robinson here with us in Bilbao, tomorrow night, it's Ian Dennis and Pat Nevin in Munich, but by Munich against Chelsea, updates of Liverpool, Atletico, Thursday night, where it's St. James' Park on five life, full commentary of Newcastle Barcelona, Manchester City Napoli on sports extra, Ryder thumps it downfield with his right foot, got a sabre, sort of leans into the ball, gets the touch there, has to keep it in play, clearance on the turn, ends up spinning away here to Timber, Timber brings it forward for Arsenal, is able to get his head up, Trossard was in a bit of space there, he's annoyed, Timber didn't deliver that cross, because Trossard felt he was in a good position, clever little nutmeg from Madueke, takes him past Bercice, back it comes to Zubemendi, Zubemendi passes back to the halfway line, Arsenal happy to keep the ball at the moment, leading one-nil, Martinelli's goal, he'd only been on the pitch for about a minute or so, having replaced Ezzer, and it was Trossard's clever little ball forward from the halfway line, that got Martinelli racing away, definite foul from Zubemendi, I'm surprised the rest are not giving that, I know he's going to let that go, there was another foul on Marino after that, but anyway Arsenal have it now with Martinelli, and Martinelli's moving at speed, takes on Garasable, beats him into the penalty area, looks for the cutback, Trossard controls, Dummies the shot deflected, and in! And that will be an Arsenal winning Bill Bow, a massive win at the start of this Champions League campaign, and it's another substitute that has done it for Mikkel Arteta, deflected shot, high into the net, athletic Bill Bow-nil, and Arsenal too! All three points heading back to London tonight, good play again by the substitutes, and it's Martinelli that's absolutely superb down that left-hand side, immediately you get it, his first thought is to go forward, they are going to check on VAR to see if there's any infringements in the build-up, as you can hear, the home fans are on the back of the referee, the home players are all surrounding the referee, but it looks at the moment that Trossard has put this game out of reach. The only thing I can see there, Paul, and we mentioned it in the commentary, was Zubemendi's challenge on the halfway line, that is way back, they always talk about the attacking phase of play, where has it started, is that crucial before Arsenal scored the goal? Well, yes, to my mind, because that's how they get the ball. Here's the challenge on the halfway line, at the time I thought that was a foul from Zubemendi, the assistant referee is close, but maybe not actually. No, there's not a lot in that, I think that's a very harsh foul, if that's given as a foul, referee sees the incident, puts his arm in the air and says, no, carry on, there's no way that's going to get given as a foul, I think the athletic player made a lot of it, Zubemendi, there was contact, but after that what ensued, Arsenal was swift, precise, down the left-hand side, Martinelli absolutely superb again, pulled it back to Trossard, first touch was brilliant, second touch was the finish and the goal stands. By rightly the goal stands, Leandro Trossard gets his first of the season, as does Gabrielle Martinelli, and again we make the point about the Arsenal squad strength. Ball loose in the Arsenal box, 89th minute of the game now, Arsenal are home and hosed, it looks like, 2-0 up and... You know, it has been a tricky fixture tonight, it always looked that way, right at the start of the campaign, six English teams in the Champions League league phase, five Spanish teams, loads of Premier League against La Liga, got another one tonight, Tottenham Villareal, tomorrow of course Liverpool, Atletico, and Thursday Newcastle Barcelona, but Arsenal look like they've put this game to bed, they're going to make a couple of late changes as well. Athletics still battling, here's Berengear, little ball to Inaki Williams, edge of the penalty, lays it back, Howard Aguilther, was he caught by Trossard? No, no contact, Howard Aguilther threw himself to the floor, in which case that was simulation, then he dives in, makes a tackle, it runs to Timber, Timber clears it, man awake, he might get there first, he doesn't quite, Mikhail Vateta furiously waving his Arsenal players in the blue shirts back to defend, he wants this clean sheet, he doesn't want any late drama, Arsenal under pressure, Cross comes in, Ryder jumps and makes a confident, easy claim. I'll tell you what, I hope the referee haven't got any holidays coming up in Bilbao, because he certainly won't be welcome back, he'll do well to get out of the stadium tonight. Rice does well for Arsenal, though he doesn't, his pass is given away, that's a wonderful bit of control there from Gooder Fagter, plays the ball to the right-hand side, Berengear tries to get a low crossing, Trossard back there for Arsenal, great bit of defending, and then he is fouled by Nico Serrano, and the Athletic fans again, they don't like it, they think Trossard has bought that, but what he's done is he's stopped, he's waited for the contact when it comes, they're always giving us free kicks. Yeah, it's clever play, it's called running the clock down, running the game down, it's been away from home, and a Champions League game in 2-0 up, heading towards the 90th minute, it's good game management. And I think the thing that you look at Arsenal's performance tonight is that's maybe the difference of what we've seen in recent years, they've found a way and they've got over the line, whereas if this game had gone by and were interviewing Michele Arthetto at the end of the game and it was 0-0, I don't think he could have had any complaints without the real creativity, without any real spark. If this game had finished 0-0, I don't think we'd have been surprised, but actually the substitutions that he made, the pro-activist that he showed, bringing on Martin and he bringing on Trossard, and at that stage in the game, sensing he could make a difference, you've got to give him a lot of credit because that has, it's changed the game, it's won the game. He will be absolutely delighted, loads of his family in here this evening, the family home about an hour away from here, Michele Arthetto born in San Sebastián, basketball, of course, could have played, qualified to play for Athletic Bill Bow, but here he is as the opposition manager, and Arsenal are going to come away with a win, Yellow Card given to Zuba Mendi for delaying the restart of the game, double change for Arsenal, two debuts, two late debuts in this game for Arsenal, in Capier and Norgard, Christian Norgard are both on, Califiori and Madueke with the two players to come off, and let's repeat before the final whistle blows, because I'm pretty sure that Arsenal are going to get this win. Six minutes about in time to be played though, Flickon bounces inside the Arsenal area, Naki Williams sticks a foot out, didn't get the touch he wanted, and Ryder is able to bend down and pick the ball up, they are going to become the first team in the history of the European Cup Champions League to beat Spanish opposition six games in a row, and when you consider how many good teams there have been down the years in this competition, it's a quirk, a quirk is assisted, but still it's impressive, and here they come again, Arsenal, and this is Norgard, first touches the ball as an Arsenal player, driving run down the right hand side, looking to get the cross in, two defenders there, it's blocked, but Norgard has managed to keep it, plays it back to Rice, four and a half minutes to play, Arsenal leading 2-0, Timber, chased down here by the substitute Rago, Timber holds him off, plays back to Mosquera, Mosquera, a couple of touches just short of the halfway line on the right, forwards to Timber, there's Rice, lovely from Arsenal, Flickton field by Rice again, Norgard swings the left boot at the ball and actually misses it this time, here's Berenge, and then Timber, slides in, makes the challenge, Berenge goes down as if he's fouled, Timber walks past him, slaps him on the back side, says you're not getting that decision, throwing for Athletic. They've done really well, Arsenal, in the latter part of this second half, once they got that first goal, they knew that Athletic would have to open up, they would have to come after them and chase the game, if they wanted to get anything out of the game, that in turn led to the gaps, and that's probably what led to Miquel Arteris thinking of the substitutions, the pace of Martin, Ellie Trossard, Maduakiu when he was on, he's just come off recently, when he was on, he was Arsenal's biggest goal threat, but it's been a very good away performance, and a good start to the Champions League. Excellent start made by Arsenal, exactly what Miquel Arteris was talking about in the press conference last night, being on it from the start, 100% concentration, imperative to start the league phase well, to not be on the back foot, and they've done precisely that. Defending to do here though, is Athletic Bill Bowman, who's been making ground into this Arsenal penalty area, Arsenal get there in numbers, it's Serrano, nearly wriggled his way through, Norgaard was able to make the challenge, Moschera clears up to Merino, lays it back to Rice, Rice pressure on him from Parades, plays back to Norgaard, Norgaard's under pressure as well, fouled here though by Serrano, and that is a free kick for Arsenal, I'm sure Arteris will be delighted as well, just about a few minutes here into the legs of Norgaard and him, and give them a feel of the plan for Arsenal. Get those players integrated into the side, into the squad, we've said so many times about the squad and the strength and depth they've got, and also to come back into this, we've got Odegaard, Saka, Habertz and Saliba, there's a lot of good players still to come back into this, they've come here tonight with three or four individuals that would have started, and like I say, the squad is looking strong, and this now, there's no excuses now for Arsenal, unless they get a load of injuries through the season, or a real dip in form, there's no reason now that this squad cannot compete on both runs. Michela Arteris will be under pressure, sorry, to deliver. Next challenge for the Manchester City at home on Sunday, it's a five-live commentary, it kicks off at half-four, Arsenal, playing this game out in total control, leading 2-0, Martinelli in the 72nd minute, Trossard making it safe in the 87th, two minutes have added time to be played, Timber from the right back position looking for the run of Martinelli, nearly fell to Rice, played forward by Rago, late charge possibly from Athletic, Berengea gets on the ball, 45 yards out on the left, Cross in, Mike Fulton and Jacqui Williams, it hit Gabrielle, fell to the Ghanaian international, but he couldn't do much with it, the ball is cleared away by Arsenal, looking like some tired players out there now, throwing four Athletic, minute and a half to play, job is nearly done, support still, fantastic inside this stadium, just as I say that, Paul Robbins has scribbled me a little note, by the way, have you seen no one is leaving this stadium? Incredible, isn't it? It's brilliant, Paul, it's absolutely phenomenal. Yeah, really enjoyed my time here, such hospitality we had last night, learning about Athletic Bill Bauer, their philosophy, fact they're back now, top level of European football for the first time in 11 seasons, next up for them, Dortmund away, next up for Arsenal, Olympiacos at home, minute to go in this game, and Arsenal lead it 2-0, and Capier makes a thumping tackle, but actually wins the throw for Arsenal as well. So throwing for Arsenal in the left back position, Nikola Teta pacing pensively, hands in pockets, way down beneath us in this San Manes Stadium, Arsenal's first ever visit, and they're going to come away with the win. Trossard makes the block, and the ball goes out for a throw in, to Athletic, into the last 30 seconds of the game, and just a few, very few, handful of the Athletic fans are finally going to beat the rush and head out of this stadium. Here's Paradez, diagonal, lofted ball to the right, nicely brought down by Niaqui Williams. 10 seconds to play, little bit of skill from him, but pass forward to Serrano, Serrano is outnumbered by the Arsenal players wide on the right, it goes out for a throw in, Athletic Bill Bauer, take their throw, Arsenal players and fans look at the referee, wait for the whistle, cross into the penalty area, Timber controls it, he has time, he flicks it in the air, he clears the ball away, and Arsenal celebrate three points at the start of their Champions League campaign. A good win, an impressive performance, goals from the Super Subs, Martin Eley and Trossard have done the job, and Arsenal become only the third English team to win away to Athletic Bill Bauer in European competition, joining Manchester United in Liverpool in achieving that feat. Not at their very best, but ruthless when the moments came. Paul Robinson. That's not underestimate the job they've done, they played against a team who had the best defensive record in the league last season, they're a tough outfit, they're always going to be a hard team to beat here at home. First half wasn't pretty, but Arsenal dug in, defensively we know that they're good, but the changes that they've made, the signers that they've made in the final third, made the difference, Maddoekli was excellent, the whole time down the right-hand side, had a real threat, Eze down the left-hand side, never really got in the game, and that forced the manager, forced his hand, they made the substitution, and the substitutes, Martin Eley and Trossard came on, it was perfect time in the game, just opened up for them, the goal appeared, Athletic had to come out, they had to press against Arsenal, the holes were there, a really good start to the season for Arsenal. Cheers and whistles for the Lithuanian referee, and the Athletic fans, I think, complaining about the Zubemendi challenge in the moments leading up to the second Arsenal goal, but the Athletic player, I think, made too much of that, they are quite right to allow the goal, and Arsenal, they have done the job, they've done exactly what Michel Artheta wanted at the start of this league-phase campaign, looked like a tricky game, and they've dealt with it well, it's finished, Athletic Bill Balneil, Arsenal too. Paul, it's all right for us to have conversations about Arsenal and strength in depth, and we've done it ad nauseum, but that is the physical demonstration of it, that's what we've seen tonight. Yeah, and it's the pro-activist of the manager to make the substitutions, and to make the substitutions at the right time, to realise that signed Eze, we need to maybe take time to integrate them into the side, didn't play well tonight, Eze at all, manager realised that, made a substitution, got the first goal, made another substitution, the strength in depth is there, and when you see what's not here, if you like, Odegaard, Saka, Havertz, Saliba, Norgard came on, let's not forget Hesous as well, who's still there in the squad, the strength in depth is there, the excuses have now been taken away from Michel Artheta, like I said, this game could have finished 0-0, it would have been a good point, okay, let's build on that, but actually they've found a way, and they've won a game which maybe they might not have won last year, really good start to the season, the only bullet, the disappointed defeat against Liverpool, come under criticism for being too defensive, protecting weaknesses rather than being proactive, but we've now seen, and in Yorker as I really like him, Steve, I think he's going to be a really good signing, you can see the willingness of his runs, tireless effort that he puts in in the box, finds really good positions, and with the players around him, like Zubemendi, like Eze, like Maddoeki, Marino, the quality that's around him, he will get chances if he works in between the 18-yard box. We've got to have a word on Martin Ely here as well, I think Ali's just sort of been pushed towards the Arsenal fans there by a couple of members of the coaching staff, that's such an important goal for him. I think it is, Steve, and that's the job now for Michel Arteta, so Paul is quite rightly saying no excuses, but it's keeping players like Martin Ely motivated and upbeat and proving to him that he's going to have a massive part to play in the season, and that's precisely it, it happened within a minute of him getting on the field, and as we say, different players with different profiles, that was perfect for him, but if that ball had been flicked through to Eze, that's not necessarily his skill set, but with Athletic pushing on, it worked perfectly there, Martin Ely's sped in, took the goal well, and you've got two players there, I know Martin Ely and Trossard, you know, will be frustrated that they're not starting games, all you can do in that situation is come on, impact the game, that's what they've done. And Martin Ely, let's not forget scored that huge goal in the Bernabas last season for Arsenal, and Michel Arteta, so the relationship that he's got with the manager, and like you said, I said it in commentary, but you've got to give Martin Ely so much credit. He will have wanted to start this game tonight, he won't be happy sat on the bench, but actually he understands his role, and he knows that he's an impact player tonight, and he says to come off the bench and do a job, and actually with his first three touches of the ball, his first touch was good, his second touch, honestly it was a brilliant touch away from the defender, and then he scores, so to have that impact and that mentality, you've got to credit his mentality for coming off the bench and doing that. Great stuff you two, thank you very much indeed. Athletic Bill Bowneil, Arsenal 2, perfect start to the new Champions League season for Michel Arteta.",
