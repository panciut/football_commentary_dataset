[0.00 - 29.78] P:1621.47 E:0.082415 |  Y
[270.00 - 272.76] P:1807.20 E:0.069939 |  koi, to Tio, and Kudasol.
[273.04 - 276.20] P:1720.83 E:0.074265 |  And finally, the man likin' to be the lone striker,
[276.44 - 277.12] P:1760.18 E:0.062940 |  Bulliga.
[277.72 - 280.96] P:1777.99 E:0.072658 |  Belarus in their red shirts, green shorts and green socks.
[281.28 - 284.72] P:1668.10 E:0.066733 |  They will kick off England in their home kit.
[284.80 - 286.92] P:1823.89 E:0.067385 |  White shirts, navy shorts, white socks.
[286.92 - 291.12] P:1679.24 E:0.069923 |  The referee is the very experienced Harry Haagat from Norway.
[291.48 - 293.24] P:1742.71 E:0.078241 |  The stadium is open to the elements.
[293.56 - 296.24] P:1646.75 E:0.079723 |  But it's been a dry day in this beautiful city of Minsk.
[296.96 - 299.08] P:1713.94 E:0.085367 |  Chile this evening though, we're underway.
[299.72 - 303.00] P:1856.94 E:0.085102 |  And again, that, well, if it's only a draw for England,
[303.88 - 305.16] P:1717.75 E:0.076666 |  it won't be catastrophic.
[305.52 - 308.40] P:1622.87 E:0.075902 |  But the way England are beginning to shape up on the Capello,
[308.88 - 310.44] P:1551.15 E:0.078628 |  we rather hope they're going to win the game.
[311.08 - 313.40] P:1721.39 E:0.060818 |  It's the savage for Belarus.
[313.68 - 316.28] P:1682.11 E:0.070054 |  Back to the captain Kulchi and then as it's played for,
[316.48 - 317.96] P:1566.55 E:0.073683 |  it was cut out by Gerard.
[318.80 - 321.16] P:1636.46 E:0.076531 |  Gerard appears to have started on the left hand side.
[321.16 - 322.08] P:1678.38 E:0.075989 |  Yes, he certainly has.
[322.08 - 324.16] P:1647.42 E:0.079252 |  Barry sitting behind Lampard at the moment.
[324.16 - 328.56] P:1675.64 E:0.073009 |  It is a regular 4-4-2 for England with Rooney tucked behind Heskey.
[329.08 - 331.88] P:1598.24 E:0.073157 |  Belarus seeing plenty of the ball in his opening mini.
[332.44 - 333.76] P:1726.95 E:0.052962 |  Mini, minutes.
[334.20 - 335.08] P:1503.11 E:0.080331 |  It is getting nifty.
[335.52 - 337.88] P:1525.10 E:0.076004 |  It's played back by Filipenko to the goalkeeper,
[338.16 - 340.44] P:1703.28 E:0.063364 |  Shephnoff, who clatters it upfield.
[341.04 - 344.32] P:1519.69 E:0.066020 |  Headed back and over the halfway line by Upson.
[344.32 - 345.56] P:1449.72 E:0.079301 |  Now here's Gareth Barry.
[345.80 - 349.44] P:1728.63 E:0.075012 |  Barry rather shrugs off the ball though Barry trying to keep the session.
[350.48 - 353.12] P:1885.83 E:0.075119 |  Foul the player and it's a free kick to Belarus.
[353.12 - 355.60] P:1788.75 E:0.084602 |  And I think in the opening minute, two minutes of the game,
[355.60 - 357.80] P:1561.24 E:0.073573 |  we'll see that Belarus will pass the ball about.
[357.80 - 360.56] P:1540.25 E:0.067925 |  They're very comfortable on it and they keep passing
[360.56 - 362.44] P:1584.69 E:0.071490 |  in nice little short movements.
[362.44 - 363.80] P:1535.30 E:0.069986 |  In fact, before the game,
[363.80 - 367.40] P:1367.65 E:0.071716 |  Kepelo actually did say that they played he thought like Arsenal now.
[367.40 - 369.96] P:1527.33 E:0.085344 |  I thought well if they're doing, then they've got a game on their hands.
[369.96 - 372.52] P:1728.97 E:0.081559 |  And also they're missing Alexander Klev of course tonight.
[373.28 - 376.12] P:1586.77 E:0.070305 |  The Barcelona former Arsenal player has an ankle injury.
[376.12 - 381.52] P:1490.50 E:0.070068 |  He's the talismanic figure described as Maradona, Platini, Pele.
[382.64 - 384.60] P:1538.31 E:0.078291 |  He's highly rated by Brent Strang.
[384.88 - 385.52] P:1465.86 E:0.059345 |  Stanger.
[385.52 - 386.92] P:1471.11 E:0.073553 |  That's a wasted throw in.
[386.96 - 390.44] P:1411.73 E:0.066894 |  They'll buy on the young truck and it goes straight behind for a goal kick.
[390.84 - 394.28] P:1567.42 E:0.066112 |  By doing on the young tree is interesting for your game because he can play
[394.28 - 395.60] P:1485.08 E:0.070822 |  anywhere on the back for it.
[395.60 - 399.48] P:1654.99 E:0.070619 |  Yeah, but it's also very interesting because we've spoken about England's line
[399.48 - 401.64] P:1523.99 E:0.072724 |  up being on a 4-4-2 with Gareth on the left.
[402.24 - 408.20] P:1749.18 E:0.071408 |  Lastly, they're coming up against a 4-1-3 two formation and Belarus.
[408.20 - 413.24] P:1586.88 E:0.073516 |  They've got a holding defensive player playing in the holding midfield player.
[413.24 - 416.68] P:1570.65 E:0.077191 |  And then the three midfield players coming forward and they're two forward.
[416.68 - 419.72] P:1673.35 E:0.079102 |  So it's a different formation than England's 4-4-2.
[419.72 - 420.72] P:1570.44 E:0.076055 |  Here's the Parma player.
[420.72 - 424.40] P:1637.70 E:0.065809 |  Kudazov exchanges passes with Kulchi.
[425.08 - 427.56] P:1478.19 E:0.068476 |  Kudazov again, ball just over the halfway line.
[427.56 - 430.44] P:1657.26 E:0.073660 |  Hesky hustling the Belarusian into a mistake.
[430.44 - 432.24] P:1579.63 E:0.068448 |  And that's a good ball by Lampard to Rooney.
[432.24 - 436.48] P:1676.14 E:0.067727 |  Quickly on to Gareth and Gareth feeds it towards the left bank and Wayne Bridge.
[436.48 - 439.40] P:1763.70 E:0.071618 |  Bridge already midway inside the Belarus Haar.
[439.40 - 440.60] P:1728.92 E:0.048449 |  Back night of Barry.
[441.44 - 444.60] P:1569.61 E:0.072470 |  Barry being tightly marked and when he played the ball forward Barry,
[444.60 - 447.44] P:1490.05 E:0.060344 |  it wasn't accurate pass and Belarus have it back.
[447.44 - 449.92] P:1559.94 E:0.063303 |  Two and a half minutes played here in Minsk.
[450.52 - 454.32] P:1539.11 E:0.071144 |  Belarus still England little and of course will keep you bang up to date
[454.32 - 457.60] P:1445.83 E:0.072838 |  with what's happening with Wales or what's happening with Northern Ireland.
[458.28 - 460.20] P:1548.37 E:0.080526 |  He has played to back.
[460.80 - 462.96] P:1558.42 E:0.082672 |  Back night to David James.
[464.44 - 466.68] P:1453.37 E:0.087485 |  Give me one error in Saturday, David James.
[466.68 - 468.28] P:1571.70 E:0.085381 |  The ball just squeezed through time.
[468.28 - 472.64] P:1623.45 E:0.080940 |  And I think Mark Johnson was saying he tends to make an error a match.
[473.28 - 475.80] P:1684.89 E:0.077569 |  Hesky heads the goalkeeper's parents on.
[475.80 - 478.00] P:1750.87 E:0.072219 |  I heard of Bruny and threw two pitchers.
[478.00 - 481.36] P:1656.24 E:0.065222 |  Bitch harsh by Mark. He makes an error but I know what he means by it.
[481.36 - 482.20] P:1594.29 E:0.062444 |  Yeah, yeah.
[482.20 - 485.44] P:1467.39 E:0.061267 |  But I mean, other people have their opinions.
[485.44 - 488.08] P:1285.78 E:0.070382 |  I still think that he is the best goalkeeper in England, you know.
[488.08 - 491.96] P:1348.23 E:0.066857 |  And he's had a fantastic career.
[491.96 - 493.16] P:1196.17 E:0.062181 |  There's no doubt about it.
[493.16 - 494.80] P:1489.20 E:0.059847 |  David, sit.
[495.44 - 496.60] P:1639.34 E:0.075092 |  I'm going to say this right.
[497.40 - 499.04] P:1335.37 E:0.076653 |  I'll get it right later anyway.
[499.04 - 501.08] P:1616.54 E:0.055047 |  He's got possession at the moment.
[501.08 - 502.48] P:1715.72 E:0.074011 |  Kulchi to the left hand side.
[502.96 - 506.60] P:1625.82 E:0.074349 |  And now it's with Petia who's running infield towards the centre circle.
[506.60 - 507.92] P:1716.04 E:0.073889 |  Back night to Kudasov.
[508.60 - 511.20] P:1751.24 E:0.077642 |  Kudasov on night to Amoyanchuk.
[511.20 - 512.76] P:1756.89 E:0.079911 |  Amoyanchuk's passed forward.
[512.76 - 515.00] P:1914.21 E:0.075841 |  There's a foul tackler by Ubson.
[515.00 - 516.60] P:1910.63 E:0.089228 |  He didn't like the referee to sit.
[516.60 - 518.80] P:1884.20 E:0.085847 |  But it wasn't either foul on Sitko.
[518.80 - 520.80] P:1921.27 E:0.087314 |  So here's a free kick to Belarus.
[520.80 - 522.20] P:1832.71 E:0.076570 |  He's thrown at the game quite brightly.
[522.20 - 525.08] P:1684.44 E:0.081439 |  Naming the ball about very well, very quickly as well.
[525.48 - 527.08] P:1805.72 E:0.084471 |  It'd be interesting as the game progresses,
[527.08 - 530.28] P:1641.40 E:0.073838 |  whether they have any penetration to all of their passing movements.
[531.08 - 533.64] P:1706.36 E:0.078930 |  Now the free kick is at least 40 yards from goal,
[533.64 - 535.68] P:1601.97 E:0.072591 |  given the angle sort of inside right channel.
[536.40 - 540.12] P:1703.57 E:0.067274 |  And Mollosh, the left back has come across.
[540.12 - 542.84] P:1713.04 E:0.065438 |  Perhaps he'll take it left footed.
[542.84 - 545.04] P:1810.87 E:0.071572 |  I don't know your shoot from this range.
[545.04 - 547.04] P:1696.32 E:0.076698 |  But actually the way he's lining up.
[547.04 - 550.12] P:1718.66 E:0.082645 |  Yeah, here's Mollosh and it is a shot driven in left footed.
[550.12 - 552.88] P:1806.53 E:0.073812 |  And James picked the ball up just in front of him,
[552.92 - 555.00] P:1597.19 E:0.084592 |  aware that there were Belarusians around,
[555.00 - 556.00] P:1713.23 E:0.060687 |  should he make an error?
[556.00 - 556.60] P:1634.89 E:0.054265 |  He didn't.
[556.60 - 557.84] P:1672.68 E:0.079810 |  And it's very interesting there.
[557.84 - 560.64] P:1592.07 E:0.063889 |  When James got it, it was very quick to look for Walcott
[560.64 - 562.48] P:1541.02 E:0.063435 |  and get it out onto that right flank.
[562.48 - 563.88] P:1696.24 E:0.072581 |  Oh, good tackle by Heskey.
[563.88 - 565.24] P:1646.81 E:0.073798 |  Heskey on to Walcott.
[565.24 - 566.92] P:1757.30 E:0.074682 |  Ruining makes a break towards the near post.
[566.92 - 569.80] P:1727.30 E:0.069723 |  Fade in towards the United striker, but behind him.
[569.80 - 572.16] P:1751.10 E:0.071589 |  And it's clear to safety by Belarus.
[572.16 - 574.64] P:1763.89 E:0.070123 |  I'm just wondering there if there's been some instructions
[574.64 - 577.44] P:1670.01 E:0.067502 |  for David James and Walcott stays up front
[577.44 - 580.88] P:1596.16 E:0.069505 |  to get a quick early release from the keeper out to Walcott
[580.88 - 582.72] P:1606.46 E:0.057984 |  so they can break very quickly.
[582.76 - 584.72] P:1679.00 E:0.071847 |  Here's Ruining from the England throw it.
[584.72 - 588.08] P:1534.32 E:0.055517 |  And trying to find Walcott doesn't quite manage that.
[588.08 - 591.28] P:1571.98 E:0.069633 |  And Belarus have it back and it's played actually quite securely
[591.28 - 593.56] P:1479.06 E:0.069177 |  towards the halfway line to Kudas off.
[593.56 - 597.16] P:1620.42 E:0.057244 |  He's immediately tackled and England have the ball back.
[597.16 - 599.48] P:1566.04 E:0.063677 |  Now it's Brown to Gerard.
[599.48 - 601.80] P:1516.72 E:0.078880 |  Gerard sort of tucked in rather than wide in the left.
[601.80 - 602.60] P:1736.95 E:0.074007 |  Yes, he is.
[602.60 - 606.44] P:1588.18 E:0.065542 |  Yeah, what he says he'll play Gerard and Lampard,
[606.44 - 607.60] P:1325.37 E:0.071067 |  you know, whenever they fit.
[607.60 - 609.92] P:1587.18 E:0.068533 |  What he hasn't said is that he played them together
[609.92 - 611.04] P:1513.73 E:0.080525 |  and he hasn't done here.
[611.04 - 612.92] P:1819.11 E:0.066513 |  He's put Barry in there.
[612.92 - 614.88] P:1930.51 E:0.083209 |  And you wouldn't say at the moment that Barry is sitting,
[614.88 - 618.76] P:1813.24 E:0.073241 |  he's just playing a normal sort of centre left midfield role
[618.76 - 621.56] P:1720.55 E:0.069580 |  with Gerard further out on the left hand side.
[621.56 - 623.84] P:1718.30 E:0.077801 |  Now we've got an England free kick on the far side of the field,
[623.84 - 626.96] P:1587.78 E:0.060911 |  right in front of the group of England fans
[626.96 - 629.56] P:1736.78 E:0.060501 |  who made the long and difficult journey to mince.
[629.56 - 634.04] P:1720.45 E:0.058656 |  Lots and lots of crosses have sent George on that far side.
[634.04 - 638.00] P:1615.74 E:0.060950 |  Lampard takes the free kick, right footed, high in, headed on.
[638.00 - 640.72] P:1531.73 E:0.058015 |  But the flag is up for an infringement.
[640.76 - 643.16] P:1592.89 E:0.066834 |  I don't know whether it was Heskey or Upson.
[643.16 - 644.76] P:1221.06 E:0.065439 |  I'm not sure it's myself now.
[644.76 - 648.72] P:1678.31 E:0.053966 |  The referee said something's wrong and it's a free kick to Belarus.
[648.72 - 652.96] P:1645.02 E:0.059631 |  I wasn't quite sure what to expect, Graeme, in terms of atmosphere.
[652.96 - 654.96] P:1535.90 E:0.067491 |  I mean, yeah, it can be noisy,
[654.96 - 658.44] P:1612.61 E:0.067556 |  but there's plenty of space up there for the noise to go.
[658.44 - 659.16] P:1751.53 E:0.052592 |  It's not...
[659.16 - 660.20] P:1658.78 E:0.075280 |  I agree with you.
[660.20 - 663.44] P:1695.22 E:0.071632 |  It's hemmed in the England team tonight,
[663.44 - 666.76] P:1685.49 E:0.071354 |  on a stadium like this, on a pitch like this.
[666.76 - 668.48] P:1651.21 E:0.075219 |  Here's Upson having to track back
[668.48 - 671.92] P:1683.41 E:0.070827 |  and does the safety first thing, puts it by the play,
[671.92 - 674.08] P:1677.99 E:0.077930 |  and it will be a throw in to Belarus.
[676.08 - 678.00] P:1632.44 E:0.084810 |  Just to remind you, Germany playing Wales tonight,
[678.00 - 679.72] P:1571.57 E:0.064757 |  Colin McNamara's at that one,
[679.72 - 683.16] P:1632.91 E:0.078717 |  Northbound San Marino as Belarus come forward.
[683.16 - 686.40] P:1711.74 E:0.065080 |  That's at Windsor Park in Dennis, is there.
[686.40 - 689.48] P:1612.40 E:0.066002 |  And the Republic of Ireland are playing Cyprus.
[689.48 - 693.12] P:1597.54 E:0.071977 |  And our latest score for another game in this group,
[693.12 - 696.40] P:1643.54 E:0.077542 |  Croatia, I'm taking the lead against Andorra.
[696.44 - 698.40] P:1808.85 E:0.057861 |  Rakat... Rakatich.
[698.40 - 700.04] P:1806.59 E:0.052652 |  Rakatich.
[700.04 - 702.24] P:1613.34 E:0.060574 |  London pitches are right.
[702.24 - 705.72] P:1546.24 E:0.074575 |  Well, it's Croatia or Belarus or whoever.
[705.72 - 707.36] P:1588.11 E:0.076517 |  Not too many itches for England at the moment.
[707.36 - 709.92] P:1520.81 E:0.065523 |  They're very comfortable with their form.
[709.92 - 712.40] P:1570.26 E:0.072962 |  Here's Lampard, short of the halfway line,
[712.40 - 714.68] P:1639.75 E:0.062555 |  right of the centre circle.
[714.68 - 716.76] P:1707.04 E:0.074219 |  Kind of spot where Gerard has gone.
[716.76 - 719.48] P:1710.42 E:0.065344 |  Gerard's gone down the right flank, actually.
[719.48 - 721.08] P:1541.77 E:0.083235 |  Has Gerard got something of a free roll?
[721.08 - 722.92] P:1693.67 E:0.084443 |  Well, I mean, we've seen this before
[722.92 - 725.52] P:1552.58 E:0.072535 |  when he has apparently been played on the left-hand side.
[725.56 - 728.64] P:1711.58 E:0.085184 |  He's had licence to move and go all over the place.
[728.64 - 731.84] P:1854.24 E:0.069082 |  And I've said previously, that's hard to pick up.
[731.84 - 734.68] P:1734.68 E:0.079307 |  The problem is, if you then lose the ball,
[734.68 - 737.12] P:1792.94 E:0.067748 |  your team can have lost its shape.
[737.12 - 739.68] P:1509.65 E:0.075026 |  And so you have to be very careful on occasions.
[739.68 - 741.00] P:1522.85 E:0.076858 |  Here's Matthew Opsson.
[741.00 - 744.32] P:1602.95 E:0.072285 |  Gerard's still predominantly on the right side.
[744.32 - 746.24] P:1670.74 E:0.071639 |  Nice with the acting captain Ferdinand.
[746.24 - 747.96] P:1575.40 E:0.075707 |  Ferdinand plays it towards the right.
[747.96 - 750.68] P:1655.65 E:0.067450 |  It's headed away, picked up by Gerard, onto Wolcott.
[750.68 - 752.36] P:1655.15 E:0.073074 |  Wolcott easily beats the defender.
[752.36 - 754.64] P:1743.32 E:0.078180 |  Wolcott plays across in, long run he was there.
[754.64 - 756.84] P:1714.87 E:0.065974 |  Was he pulled back? I thought he was fouled.
[756.84 - 758.88] P:1655.54 E:0.077107 |  I think that could have been a penalty kick for England
[758.88 - 760.08] P:1655.90 E:0.076855 |  and the referee ignores.
[760.08 - 762.88] P:1752.76 E:0.074554 |  Yeah, there was no reaction by the referee
[762.88 - 765.56] P:1689.72 E:0.072023 |  or his assistants on the far part of the pitch,
[765.56 - 768.24] P:1661.11 E:0.071774 |  but certainly they looked at it, there was a little pull
[768.24 - 769.60] P:1480.69 E:0.087242 |  on rune as he went.
[769.60 - 771.20] P:1417.05 E:0.076616 |  Yeah, I thought rune was pulled back there
[771.20 - 773.96] P:1603.99 E:0.057431 |  and that should have been a penalty for England.
[773.96 - 776.28] P:1506.17 E:0.058705 |  But the referee was having none of it.
[776.28 - 779.64] P:1626.87 E:0.077919 |  It wasn't just rune who reacted, it was Heskey who was looking behind.
[779.64 - 782.24] P:1474.38 E:0.074511 |  I think that was a genuine hurt there.
[783.24 - 787.44] P:1493.60 E:0.076306 |  Good move involving Gerard and Wolcott in the cross into rune.
[787.44 - 788.96] P:1649.66 E:0.068027 |  Nice.
[788.96 - 792.00] P:1594.96 E:0.076468 |  Kulchi, captain for Belarus, not a good ball forward.
[792.00 - 796.52] P:1671.68 E:0.065211 |  Straight through to James. James throws it out to Lampar and now Barrett.
[796.52 - 800.16] P:1630.06 E:0.076374 |  And now here's Wes Bryan and Bryan drifts it towards Heskey.
[800.16 - 802.64] P:1649.17 E:0.064482 |  Heskey takes it into the chest.
[802.64 - 807.24] P:1606.72 E:0.065536 |  The referee's given a free kick for a foul, a barge on Heskey.
[807.24 - 809.88] P:1728.86 E:0.057487 |  Inside right channel for England.
[809.88 - 811.08] P:1595.75 E:0.063660 |  Lampar takes it.
[811.24 - 813.80] P:1534.19 E:0.069507 |  And I'm trying to pick out where Gerard's going now.
[813.80 - 816.96] P:1584.36 E:0.077805 |  And he's moving about, isn't he?
[816.96 - 820.32] P:1677.26 E:0.060648 |  There's no doubt about it that he's coming in,
[820.32 - 822.76] P:1622.01 E:0.072902 |  diagonally on a lot of occasions from that left hand side.
[822.76 - 825.16] P:1844.72 E:0.076243 |  Lampar's free kick, Heskey heads it on,
[825.16 - 828.32] P:1691.96 E:0.052746 |  but that's one bounce and behind for Wolcott.
[831.12 - 832.96] P:1596.07 E:0.075234 |  They're always going to bring up Ferdinand and Opsen.
[832.96 - 836.08] P:1683.08 E:0.067968 |  I think Opsen's actually very good in the air in those situations.
[836.08 - 839.80] P:1512.18 E:0.068393 |  And I think they found both against Croatia and Kazakhstan,
[839.80 - 842.56] P:1520.78 E:0.075093 |  you know, to get your big boys up and they're defending,
[842.56 - 843.84] P:1652.61 E:0.071286 |  the opposition's defending,
[843.84 - 846.20] P:1740.47 E:0.071563 |  Bunleys does, sometimes hasn't been the best.
[846.20 - 849.68] P:1638.74 E:0.069569 |  And who knows, that might be the case with Belarus tonight.
[849.68 - 855.28] P:1716.31 E:0.072074 |  Well, I hate to say it, but England's fans aren't the only ones treated to a ban.
[855.28 - 859.80] P:1729.46 E:0.070667 |  There's a ban trying to energise the Belarusian fans.
[859.80 - 860.80] P:1615.06 E:0.067089 |  It's just...
[860.80 - 863.52] P:1437.70 E:0.063013 |  Why don't they have that, you know, at the football ground?
[863.52 - 866.68] P:1555.54 E:0.063921 |  If the fans are passionate anyway, why don't they need a ban?
[867.68 - 869.48] P:1710.44 E:0.057934 |  Anyway, throw into England.
[869.48 - 872.84] P:1640.27 E:0.062299 |  And after a good, bright opening for Belarus, England,
[872.84 - 875.32] P:1613.00 E:0.055114 |  I've got rather more command of the game at the moment.
[875.32 - 877.00] P:1782.13 E:0.067899 |  Here's Bridge, on towards Heskey.
[877.00 - 880.60] P:1680.85 E:0.076733 |  Not a great ball from the Chelsea fullback, easily intercepted.
[880.60 - 885.40] P:1741.11 E:0.072201 |  And now here's Bulliga to the right-hand side.
[885.40 - 887.80] P:1672.92 E:0.074796 |  It's played in by the fullback.
[887.80 - 890.88] P:1663.25 E:0.076803 |  And here's good movement now by Kudasov, the parmer player,
[890.88 - 893.40] P:1573.36 E:0.073098 |  and then he runs the ball away and out he was possession.
[893.40 - 896.28] P:1605.82 E:0.074359 |  And it's cleared by England towards the right-hand side.
[896.44 - 898.16] P:1675.92 E:0.074854 |  It chase after by Wolcott.
[898.16 - 899.88] P:1807.79 E:0.067553 |  Wolcott couldn't get there first.
[899.88 - 904.32] P:1681.15 E:0.068868 |  The defender gets there and Belarus have it again on the halfway line.
[904.32 - 907.00] P:1648.01 E:0.072414 |  Drifted towards the left flank towards Bulliga.
[907.00 - 909.92] P:1500.15 E:0.063374 |  Across came Ferdinand, Bulliga trying to keep the ball in play.
[909.92 - 911.76] P:1599.38 E:0.058472 |  Can only hit it behind for a goal kick.
[911.76 - 915.16] P:1645.41 E:0.069237 |  There's no doubt in my mind that England have seen the case
[915.16 - 918.52] P:1559.12 E:0.068894 |  of getting early release of Wolcott when they can get him away.
[918.52 - 921.52] P:1627.75 E:0.068674 |  They're getting the ball either to him or for him.
[921.52 - 924.92] P:1632.55 E:0.070942 |  And it seems pretty obvious to me that this is one of the things,
[924.96 - 928.36] P:1563.63 E:0.069832 |  one of the main reasons he's well whilst Wolcott is in the side
[928.36 - 930.24] P:1738.39 E:0.057483 |  cos he has exceptional pace.
[931.12 - 938.24] P:1635.95 E:0.065684 |  Belarus lost to Ukraine, a very late goal, robbing them of a point,
[938.24 - 941.12] P:1685.41 E:0.066837 |  and then they won away to Andorra.
[941.12 - 944.56] P:1661.22 E:0.072534 |  They're a decent side, and they've shown that in the opening minutes,
[944.56 - 945.76] P:1809.86 E:0.062355 |  but there's a mistake.
[945.76 - 948.20] P:1783.16 E:0.074459 |  Rooney's after it, Rooney brilliant control.
[948.20 - 950.72] P:1842.29 E:0.074728 |  Gerard comes up, Gerards shoots into the net!
[950.72 - 954.08] P:1739.95 E:0.078197 |  Glorious goal by Stephen Gerard from 30 yards,
[954.12 - 956.24] P:1731.48 E:0.077805 |  magnificent England lead 1-0.
[957.40 - 960.36] P:1824.87 E:0.085201 |  Rooney's some great skill, some great touch of the ball.
[960.36 - 962.64] P:1828.81 E:0.076142 |  He's facing his own goal, really.
[962.64 - 965.80] P:1816.43 E:0.069924 |  Sees Gerard coming up to him from that left-hand side,
[965.80 - 970.76] P:1745.25 E:0.071288 |  typically on his right foot, and Gerard has bent it in from about 30 yards.
[970.76 - 973.76] P:1837.51 E:0.067562 |  He's done it deliberately, he's picked his spot.
[973.76 - 977.40] P:1800.06 E:0.069787 |  It's an absolutely first-class strike at goal, an excellent goal.
[977.40 - 979.00] P:1497.62 E:0.070921 |  Bent it in to the far post.
[979.00 - 981.48] P:1581.53 E:0.078912 |  It's 1-0 to England, what a wonderful start.
[982.12 - 985.16] P:1704.41 E:0.073473 |  Well, it was a passed shot, wasn't it?
[985.16 - 986.96] P:1738.91 E:0.081631 |  Brilliantly struck by Gerard.
[986.96 - 989.48] P:1707.29 E:0.075674 |  He knew precisely what he was doing.
[989.48 - 992.00] P:1516.65 E:0.077731 |  That wasn't hit in hope. That was deliberate.
[992.00 - 993.60] P:1576.56 E:0.069938 |  Yeah, he's bent it in, hasn't he?
[993.60 - 995.84] P:1666.55 E:0.069076 |  He's picked his spot round the keeper,
[995.84 - 1000.32] P:1617.59 E:0.069467 |  and there's a Rooney to start with, control the ball extremely well.
[1000.32 - 1002.32] P:1473.48 E:0.069498 |  Well, what a great opening for England.
[1002.32 - 1005.24] P:1458.16 E:0.080639 |  And what a terrific goal by Stephen Gerard.
[1005.24 - 1009.60] P:1373.70 E:0.070808 |  The 14th he scored in England colours, and it's ironic last week
[1009.64 - 1012.52] P:1538.74 E:0.074046 |  in the chat was about Gerard, can Gerard play with Lampard,
[1012.52 - 1014.72] P:1676.73 E:0.080852 |  and he didn't have a good game in Saturday, Stephen Gerard.
[1014.72 - 1018.80] P:1813.21 E:0.071419 |  Well, that question, nobody asked more questions of Stephen Gerard than he does.
[1018.80 - 1022.20] P:1327.32 E:0.074493 |  He knew that he put in a below par performance,
[1022.20 - 1025.92] P:1592.87 E:0.048144 |  but he's responded terrifically well tonight.
[1025.92 - 1028.92] P:1533.85 E:0.064764 |  Here's Bridge playing it over the half-way line,
[1028.92 - 1031.44] P:1553.63 E:0.066004 |  where it's intercepted, and here's Petillo,
[1031.44 - 1036.52] P:1663.60 E:0.064252 |  Petillo into Kulchi, Kulchi just moving inside the centre circle.
[1036.52 - 1040.52] P:1592.20 E:0.069255 |  Well, if there's any dynamism from the Belarus fans,
[1040.52 - 1042.84] P:1694.70 E:0.062822 |  that goal will have snuffed it out.
[1042.84 - 1044.32] P:1657.32 E:0.064445 |  Well, we think it will have snuffed it out.
[1044.32 - 1045.24] P:1755.94 E:0.059717 |  We'll see.
[1045.24 - 1050.04] P:1686.40 E:0.066344 |  Belarus nil, England won, a goal by Stephen Gerard, an absolute peach.
[1050.04 - 1052.04] P:1527.12 E:0.070735 |  At the moment, you know, from Belarus,
[1052.04 - 1055.76] P:1455.06 E:0.062753 |  but they've had a lot of possession, they move the ball about comfortably,
[1055.76 - 1059.96] P:1479.03 E:0.065113 |  and they haven't looked at all as if they're going to breach that England back four at all.
[1059.96 - 1062.76] P:1458.78 E:0.062292 |  There's a lot of passing, a lot of movement by them,
[1062.76 - 1065.04] P:1531.41 E:0.050833 |  but very little end product so far.
[1065.08 - 1068.48] P:1773.65 E:0.057142 |  Can we tell how much they miss Mr. Kled?
[1069.20 - 1070.64] P:1630.93 E:0.078082 |  Well, you'd think so, would you, Grel,
[1070.64 - 1073.96] P:1574.58 E:0.058163 |  although he would even increase their passing even more to tell you the truth.
[1073.96 - 1077.52] P:1749.13 E:0.069944 |  Pesky heads on the clearance, Rooney heads it back to Pesky,
[1077.52 - 1080.00] P:1454.79 E:0.067287 |  and then it's a header away by the defender,
[1080.00 - 1083.76] P:1637.80 E:0.078699 |  and Belarus move sweetly towards the half-way line,
[1083.76 - 1085.52] P:1701.38 E:0.066964 |  and then that's not a good pass.
[1085.52 - 1089.88] P:1677.59 E:0.073709 |  Easily intercepted by Ferdinand, but his clearance runs straight to those in red again.
[1089.88 - 1093.52] P:1631.87 E:0.060229 |  Petillo playing it to the right plank, and Omeyantchuk,
[1093.56 - 1098.16] P:1615.03 E:0.066858 |  Omeyantchuk forward again, and now it's running by Petillo.
[1098.16 - 1102.80] P:1686.16 E:0.074631 |  Petillo, back and there's a long range shot driven in, David David almost built it.
[1102.80 - 1105.68] P:1835.05 E:0.076288 |  Good discretion, not only did he let it come off his chest,
[1105.68 - 1108.44] P:1716.33 E:0.071808 |  then when he put his hands on the ball it squirted through his hands,
[1108.44 - 1112.16] P:1699.28 E:0.071846 |  and luckily he managed eventually to gain control of the shot.
[1112.16 - 1114.80] P:1577.95 E:0.080630 |  I think he got in behind the ball and he needed to get that,
[1114.80 - 1119.24] P:1696.38 E:0.068819 |  cos that ball certainly dipped in very much in the last few seconds.
[1119.24 - 1121.48] P:1850.19 E:0.080890 |  Gerard Dehesky, Gerard again, another shot,
[1121.60 - 1124.16] P:1553.01 E:0.071674 |  and this one's inches wide of the right hand upright.
[1124.16 - 1125.68] P:1172.01 E:0.080004 |  Going end to end at the moment Alan,
[1125.68 - 1130.36] P:1483.74 E:0.071136 |  aren't we there with a long shot from Belarus coming in that James failed to collect,
[1130.36 - 1133.80] P:1534.99 E:0.077273 |  and then immediately at the end Gerard comes in on that right foot
[1133.80 - 1136.20] P:1659.77 E:0.067905 |  coming in from that left side of the pitch.
[1136.20 - 1139.72] P:1665.12 E:0.071643 |  Now Capallo, that's at the moment talking to David James,
[1139.72 - 1141.36] P:1743.24 E:0.063468 |  and quite know what about it.
[1142.52 - 1145.92] P:1717.64 E:0.072980 |  It's a long way between coach and goalkeeper,
[1145.92 - 1149.20] P:1684.67 E:0.072147 |  good 50 yards and how much you can communicate with sign language.
[1149.60 - 1151.84] P:1631.05 E:0.072917 |  I don't think it was criticism of what happened.
[1151.84 - 1152.32] P:1474.76 E:0.071360 |  No, no.
[1152.32 - 1154.00] P:1825.34 E:0.049550 |  It's something else,
[1154.00 - 1157.48] P:1738.98 E:0.061025 |  and perhaps in terms of how he's distributing possession from the back.
[1158.44 - 1160.24] P:1670.16 E:0.078830 |  Well, that was just a worrying moment for England,
[1160.24 - 1161.52] P:1765.65 E:0.067301 |  and particularly for David James,
[1161.52 - 1162.52] P:1191.46 E:0.081060 |  but England lead 1-0,
[1162.52 - 1166.12] P:1600.67 E:0.058247 |  and we played nearly a quarter of an hour here on five line in minutes.
[1167.20 - 1169.36] P:1601.47 E:0.066722 |  It's fed forward by Gareth Barry,
[1169.36 - 1172.72] P:1749.14 E:0.052469 |  but headed out of play by Sistaevich.
[1174.04 - 1175.36] P:1303.59 E:0.086500 |  When I thought there was an hour in his name,
[1175.36 - 1177.08] P:1696.24 E:0.068558 |  it was a lot easier to say earlier.
[1177.08 - 1178.80] P:1600.22 E:0.063037 |  Then when we took the hour right,
[1178.84 - 1180.24] P:1685.39 E:0.057486 |  suddenly I can't say it.
[1180.24 - 1181.24] P:1705.80 E:0.088559 |  Throwing goes to Rooney.
[1181.24 - 1184.20] P:1743.67 E:0.057832 |  Rooney's contribution to Gerard's goal was terrific.
[1184.20 - 1187.52] P:1547.57 E:0.073265 |  Lampard hits it away to the right side towards Walcott,
[1187.52 - 1189.16] P:1579.77 E:0.080749 |  and Brian was caught there.
[1189.16 - 1191.36] P:1760.27 E:0.080429 |  It was a lazy pass back by Walcott.
[1191.36 - 1192.88] P:1837.62 E:0.075292 |  Belarus on the attack.
[1192.88 - 1194.88] P:1787.09 E:0.073657 |  Good run down the left flank.
[1194.88 - 1195.96] P:1722.62 E:0.074258 |  The cross wasn't great.
[1195.96 - 1197.28] P:1655.61 E:0.080075 |  Should have been intercepted by Barry.
[1197.28 - 1199.40] P:1642.74 E:0.067909 |  Wasn't, luckily enough, Bridge with there.
[1199.40 - 1200.68] P:1699.31 E:0.055050 |  Bridge finds Brian,
[1200.68 - 1203.20] P:1686.77 E:0.065296 |  and Brian hits it upfield towards Rooney.
[1203.20 - 1207.20] P:1753.43 E:0.065982 |  Rooney slips and can't get possession halfway like.
[1207.24 - 1209.04] P:1675.29 E:0.052678 |  Cleared by Bridge again.
[1209.04 - 1210.68] P:1614.33 E:0.067625 |  Into the Belarus half,
[1210.68 - 1212.88] P:1263.23 E:0.060175 |  and again, Capello's out there,
[1212.88 - 1214.92] P:1647.08 E:0.050281 |  shedding instructions.
[1214.92 - 1217.52] P:1469.88 E:0.074615 |  Still trying to find out where Steven Gerard's playing.
[1217.52 - 1220.60] P:1624.51 E:0.069687 |  I've got a much freeroll that I imagine he has.
[1220.60 - 1222.60] P:1760.47 E:0.057225 |  Here's Bulliga.
[1222.60 - 1224.44] P:1649.56 E:0.055057 |  To the left flank.
[1224.44 - 1225.68] P:1633.46 E:0.048433 |  And Sitko.
[1225.68 - 1228.08] P:1556.08 E:0.059929 |  Sitko back now to Patio.
[1228.08 - 1231.16] P:1610.78 E:0.071560 |  Patio about 35 yards from goal.
[1231.16 - 1232.32] P:1660.33 E:0.065068 |  To Kudizov.
[1232.32 - 1234.12] P:1692.57 E:0.060768 |  Back to the captain, Kulchi.
[1234.12 - 1236.40] P:1636.86 E:0.080571 |  Kulchi looking to play a one-two, didn't come off.
[1237.40 - 1240.40] P:1590.93 E:0.065526 |  Despite the fact that Belarus fans seem to think
[1240.40 - 1242.40] P:1466.83 E:0.066738 |  the referee should be blowing their whistle.
[1242.40 - 1244.40] P:1686.39 E:0.068832 |  Blowing his whistle even.
[1244.40 - 1246.40] P:1683.71 E:0.068427 |  Kulchi again.
[1246.40 - 1248.40] P:1759.00 E:0.068638 |  Middle of the England half.
[1248.40 - 1250.40] P:1544.10 E:0.057686 |  Plays it right, but it quite deliberately,
[1250.40 - 1252.40] P:1552.57 E:0.068637 |  but it was so deliberate it was telegraphed in effect.
[1252.40 - 1254.40] P:1494.86 E:0.061627 |  And Bridge could head it away to safety.
[1254.40 - 1256.40] P:1521.71 E:0.060956 |  They are a short passing side.
[1256.40 - 1258.40] P:1214.25 E:0.061654 |  There's no doubt about them, Belarus.
[1258.40 - 1261.40] P:1320.13 E:0.066205 |  They don't, you know, they look to keep the ball within their team.
[1261.40 - 1263.40] P:1325.30 E:0.054801 |  A lot of passing.
[1263.40 - 1265.40] P:1322.31 E:0.069597 |  Quite a lot of movement as well,
[1266.40 - 1268.40] P:1334.77 E:0.059195 |  but they are passing his 5, 10 yards, no more than that.
[1268.40 - 1271.40] P:1584.31 E:0.071057 |  Steven Gerrard's goal has put England in front here
[1271.40 - 1273.40] P:1778.14 E:0.062367 |  in Minsk against Belarus.
[1273.40 - 1276.40] P:1513.51 E:0.057562 |  It's with Belarus at the moment.
[1276.40 - 1278.40] P:1387.59 E:0.050597 |  On the half way line.
[1278.40 - 1280.40] P:1515.88 E:0.052586 |  With Molloch, the left back.
[1282.40 - 1284.40] P:1594.56 E:0.085741 |  They play it very patiently.
[1284.40 - 1286.40] P:1357.31 E:0.065371 |  They are sort of mini version of Arsenal.
[1286.40 - 1288.40] P:1517.86 E:0.068178 |  They won't be hurried.
[1288.40 - 1290.40] P:1724.42 E:0.073142 |  That's a good ball fed to Molloch again.
[1290.40 - 1292.40] P:1778.61 E:0.082266 |  Cut forward now.
[1292.40 - 1294.40] P:1783.90 E:0.078812 |  They are going in James Fulton again.
[1294.40 - 1297.40] P:1843.28 E:0.076598 |  That wasn't quite as urgent,
[1297.40 - 1299.40] P:1917.57 E:0.069642 |  but it looked like a soft shot
[1299.40 - 1301.40] P:1881.89 E:0.069177 |  that he should have plucked
[1301.40 - 1303.40] P:1614.19 E:0.081673 |  100 times out of 101.
[1303.40 - 1305.40] P:1803.69 E:0.075037 |  I thought it was an early shot Alan.
[1305.40 - 1307.40] P:1774.73 E:0.078788 |  Good pass into Heskey.
[1307.40 - 1309.40] P:1769.74 E:0.072661 |  Heskey just offside.
[1309.40 - 1311.40] P:1706.69 E:0.078587 |  I think it was a very early shot by them
[1311.40 - 1313.40] P:1840.95 E:0.067690 |  and took David James by surprise.
[1313.40 - 1315.40] P:1814.53 E:0.063732 |  I don't think so much it was the power of it.
[1315.40 - 1318.40] P:1690.47 E:0.068326 |  I think it was that he took it so early and so quickly.
[1318.40 - 1320.40] P:1717.86 E:0.064960 |  And it almost caught him off guard.
[1320.40 - 1322.40] P:1684.05 E:0.049651 |  David James is a very confident goalkeeper.
[1322.40 - 1324.40] P:1641.77 E:0.069961 |  It doesn't matter how narrow it is.
[1324.40 - 1326.40] P:1653.55 E:0.074095 |  It doesn't let it get to him.
[1326.40 - 1328.40] P:1649.32 E:0.056092 |  I just want him to dismiss those couple of incidents.
[1328.40 - 1330.40] P:1701.35 E:0.066100 |  It's going to have to be.
[1330.40 - 1332.40] P:1712.92 E:0.070201 |  The point I was making when I said
[1332.40 - 1334.40] P:1664.39 E:0.075367 |  the best goalkeeper in England
[1334.40 - 1336.40] P:1510.13 E:0.078377 |  was talking about the best English goalkeeper.
[1336.40 - 1338.40] P:1562.50 E:0.076040 |  The best that we've got.
[1338.40 - 1340.40] P:1615.36 E:0.070446 |  Here comes Stas Ervich.
[1340.40 - 1342.40] P:1683.30 E:0.066388 |  That's lazy play from the midfield.
[1342.40 - 1344.40] P:1738.93 E:0.083637 |  David James is a very confident goalkeeper.
[1344.40 - 1346.40] P:1828.65 E:0.078541 |  He's a very confident goalkeeper.
[1346.40 - 1348.40] P:1814.47 E:0.079543 |  He's a very confident goalkeeper.
[1348.40 - 1350.40] P:1807.23 E:0.069794 |  But that's lazy play from the midfield player.
[1350.40 - 1352.40] P:1771.78 E:0.065421 |  It's cleared away.
[1352.40 - 1354.40] P:1540.57 E:0.065279 |  It wasn't a good ball by Upson.
[1354.40 - 1356.40] P:1527.11 E:0.070702 |  Well ahead of Barry and out it goes for a throw in
[1356.40 - 1359.40] P:1596.16 E:0.059764 |  which Kultje the Belarus captain will take.
[1359.40 - 1361.40] P:1659.81 E:0.049477 |  Stas Ervich again.
[1361.40 - 1362.40] P:1727.20 E:0.076455 |  Kultje wants more.
[1362.40 - 1364.40] P:1467.30 E:0.070001 |  Just a yard inside the England half plays it
[1364.40 - 1366.40] P:1455.66 E:0.048294 |  back to Filippenko.
[1366.40 - 1369.40] P:1605.74 E:0.061177 |  And Filippenko just 20 years of age.
[1369.40 - 1372.40] P:1648.48 E:0.058833 |  His pass forward intercepted by Lampard.
[1372.40 - 1375.40] P:1471.29 E:0.057432 |  Lampard trying to feed it back to Rooney.
[1375.40 - 1378.40] P:1321.99 E:0.056450 |  And then I think Rooney just stopped running.
[1378.40 - 1381.40] P:1321.34 E:0.061029 |  Lampard had anticipated that he wouldn't.
[1381.40 - 1384.40] P:1495.62 E:0.059693 |  And consequently the ball is through to the goalkeeper's shaft.
[1384.40 - 1386.40] P:1665.51 E:0.062139 |  18 minutes play.
[1386.40 - 1388.40] P:1525.89 E:0.068517 |  You're seeing the 5 life sport on the BBC.
[1388.40 - 1390.40] P:1551.98 E:0.056907 |  Belarus nil.
[1390.40 - 1392.40] P:1445.68 E:0.059081 |  England won.
[1392.40 - 1395.40] P:1555.84 E:0.067496 |  And if you get near television set later,
[1395.40 - 1398.40] P:1596.15 E:0.071420 |  I don't want you to deny, if you get near television set later,
[1398.40 - 1400.40] P:1771.97 E:0.059315 |  look out for Gerard's goal.
[1400.40 - 1402.40] P:1688.87 E:0.049946 |  Excellent.
[1402.40 - 1404.40] P:1522.22 E:0.073146 |  Briggs that's a good ball to Gerard.
[1404.40 - 1406.40] P:1743.72 E:0.070275 |  And then the pass from Gerard though.
[1406.40 - 1408.40] P:1789.86 E:0.071503 |  Gay possession away far too easily.
[1408.40 - 1411.40] P:1811.96 E:0.068592 |  Kultje to the left hand side in Sitko.
[1411.40 - 1413.40] P:1777.42 E:0.067967 |  Into Kultje again.
[1413.40 - 1415.40] P:1620.90 E:0.078244 |  25 yards from goal.
[1415.40 - 1418.40] P:1737.84 E:0.078747 |  Looking to feed it back and the shot driven in by Kutters off.
[1418.40 - 1420.40] P:1780.44 E:0.076630 |  And again James had to make the save.
[1420.40 - 1422.40] P:1719.56 E:0.075670 |  This time the ball never stopped from his grasp.
[1422.40 - 1424.40] P:1742.12 E:0.081148 |  They got down very well to it.
[1424.40 - 1426.40] P:1517.02 E:0.073757 |  I have to say this as well.
[1426.40 - 1428.40] P:1642.95 E:0.072356 |  We're early I was saying there's no end product.
[1428.40 - 1430.40] P:1649.19 E:0.062031 |  They've now had three or four shots from the edge of the box.
[1430.40 - 1433.40] P:1323.62 E:0.076921 |  And they've moved the ball about very well.
[1433.40 - 1435.40] P:1580.98 E:0.054275 |  They've made a promising side.
[1435.40 - 1437.40] P:1564.70 E:0.072385 |  Well they've had some excellent results as Mike was saying.
[1437.40 - 1441.40] P:1543.20 E:0.075239 |  You know before kick off who draws against Germany.
[1441.40 - 1443.40] P:1590.10 E:0.068423 |  And against Argentina.
[1443.40 - 1446.40] P:1600.63 E:0.073056 |  Interesting thing Alan as well.
[1446.40 - 1448.40] P:1571.97 E:0.072748 |  Kultje is apparently playing a holding role.
[1448.40 - 1451.40] P:1530.79 E:0.068498 |  He's been involved in a left of play in the...
[1451.40 - 1453.40] P:1692.39 E:0.061804 |  Heskey for England.
[1453.40 - 1455.40] P:1594.10 E:0.063473 |  Back to Lampard.
[1455.40 - 1457.40] P:1554.28 E:0.075030 |  And now to Ferdinand.
[1457.40 - 1459.40] P:1689.67 E:0.072800 |  David James.
[1459.40 - 1461.40] P:1780.77 E:0.067817 |  Surface looks pretty good doesn't it?
[1461.40 - 1464.40] P:1688.69 E:0.058955 |  When I first thought I wondered if it looked a little bit long
[1464.40 - 1466.40] P:1452.04 E:0.070324 |  but nobody's having any problems at all.
[1466.40 - 1469.40] P:1648.32 E:0.062028 |  And it is very important to get a good surface.
[1469.40 - 1471.40] P:1879.71 E:0.061512 |  Particularly when you come to away games.
[1471.40 - 1474.40] P:1698.45 E:0.069232 |  There's a good pass by Ferdinand to Heskey down the right flank.
[1474.40 - 1476.40] P:1565.61 E:0.057433 |  The big man holds it up.
[1476.40 - 1478.40] P:1611.99 E:0.069402 |  Then he plays it back. Here's Lampard.
[1478.40 - 1480.40] P:1678.73 E:0.056873 |  Excellent pass by Lampard.
[1480.40 - 1482.40] P:1662.64 E:0.060445 |  Just drifting it from right to left.
[1482.40 - 1484.40] P:1695.99 E:0.049441 |  Finds Bridge on to Gerard.
[1484.40 - 1486.40] P:1620.89 E:0.060710 |  Gerard almost lost possession there.
[1486.40 - 1488.40] P:1650.37 E:0.066355 |  Still find Bridge back to Gerard.
[1488.40 - 1490.40] P:1576.48 E:0.071113 |  On to Bridge. This is good football.
[1490.40 - 1492.40] P:1700.14 E:0.063523 |  Bridge with the crossing.
[1492.40 - 1494.40] P:1704.01 E:0.071753 |  Throws the edge of the penalty here.
[1494.40 - 1496.40] P:1496.27 E:0.070842 |  Clear it on the half volley.
[1496.40 - 1498.40] P:1519.30 E:0.053147 |  And now here's Bulliga.
[1498.40 - 1500.40] P:1496.23 E:0.060047 |  Bulliga the one proper striker.
[1500.40 - 1502.40] P:1532.48 E:0.071806 |  Playing it back and quickly forward to Kudizov.
[1502.40 - 1504.40] P:1544.60 E:0.076679 |  Bulliga is now furthest forward again.
[1504.40 - 1506.40] P:1727.08 E:0.076416 |  He's just set his own penalty here a few seconds ago.
[1506.40 - 1508.40] P:1784.23 E:0.075252 |  Sit go.
[1508.40 - 1510.40] P:1711.44 E:0.079656 |  Playing it to the left hand side.
[1510.40 - 1513.40] P:1638.90 E:0.075490 |  But Wolk had a track back and that's a mistake by Wolk.
[1513.40 - 1515.40] P:1740.35 E:0.078395 |  He should have cleared the ball.
[1515.40 - 1517.40] P:1625.89 E:0.073332 |  Crossed in the England penalty area.
[1517.40 - 1519.40] P:1604.62 E:0.072024 |  Headed away by Ferdinand.
[1519.40 - 1521.40] P:1669.54 E:0.067835 |  Bulliga tackle.
[1521.40 - 1524.40] P:1742.17 E:0.071262 |  Ball breaks to Rooney and Rooney can head it towards Heskey
[1524.40 - 1526.40] P:1649.28 E:0.065493 |  in the halfway line.
[1526.40 - 1528.40] P:1576.69 E:0.079091 |  Heskey was trying very hard to feed it towards the right
[1528.40 - 1531.40] P:1819.81 E:0.076002 |  towards Wolk but couldn't quite get the pass on.
[1531.40 - 1533.40] P:1754.74 E:0.078673 |  And Belarus have it again.
[1533.40 - 1535.40] P:1664.53 E:0.074389 |  They've come back well since England scored.
[1535.40 - 1537.40] P:1576.99 E:0.076853 |  I think they've played very well to tell you
[1537.40 - 1539.40] P:1655.09 E:0.061341 |  particularly going that goal down to Bat-Tackle.
[1539.40 - 1542.40] P:1862.78 E:0.071696 |  Right. Who? And there's a yellow card.
[1542.40 - 1545.40] P:1981.58 E:0.087948 |  But more to the point, who's the England third eye?
[1545.40 - 1547.40] P:1986.76 E:0.084898 |  Not quite. Is it Lampard?
[1547.40 - 1549.40] P:1985.96 E:0.085598 |  Yep. He's getting up for it, certainly.
[1552.40 - 1554.40] P:1975.78 E:0.080651 |  Creature two.
[1554.40 - 1557.40] P:1934.31 E:0.077762 |  Andorraniel, Ollich has got the second goal.
[1558.40 - 1560.40] P:1804.92 E:0.078317 |  Well, you could assume they were going to get three points
[1560.40 - 1562.40] P:1809.51 E:0.063313 |  at home goal and door. Yes.
[1562.40 - 1565.40] P:1715.58 E:0.063786 |  But remember they dropped two points at the weekend.
[1565.40 - 1567.40] P:1677.68 E:0.067850 |  That was a very nice draw for England.
[1567.40 - 1569.40] P:1659.28 E:0.054351 |  It was a great new creation.
[1569.40 - 1571.40] P:1593.39 E:0.077710 |  It was always good. You know, you can only look after your own results
[1571.40 - 1574.40] P:1669.39 E:0.064573 |  but then when a couple of the other results go for you,
[1574.40 - 1576.40] P:1589.08 E:0.068536 |  it was a nice result. It does help.
[1576.40 - 1578.40] P:1643.15 E:0.065747 |  Now, Bridge almost got himself in trouble there.
[1578.40 - 1580.40] P:1713.91 E:0.064056 |  Andorraniel, Ollich, Kohl.
[1580.40 - 1583.40] P:1752.15 E:0.058478 |  But he managed to retrieve his own mistake and I've burdened it.
[1583.40 - 1586.40] P:1751.38 E:0.063412 |  Lift the clearance high towards Heskey.
[1586.40 - 1588.40] P:1641.14 E:0.057948 |  Heskey jumped. Didn't make contact with the ball.
[1588.40 - 1591.40] P:1509.20 E:0.071654 |  Runny's frustrated that the ball didn't go in his direction.
[1591.40 - 1593.40] P:1419.74 E:0.063863 |  I think one of the problems Wainbridge has
[1593.40 - 1597.40] P:1564.44 E:0.065067 |  when he's getting possession is with Steve and Gerard moving from that left leg.
[1597.40 - 1600.40] P:1471.36 E:0.062945 |  He doesn't always have somebody outside on him in the line.
[1600.40 - 1603.40] P:1533.66 E:0.062427 |  So his options of passing, they just cut down a little bit.
[1603.40 - 1607.40] P:1526.42 E:0.068946 |  You know, unless Gerard were to stay there, which none of us wanted to do,
[1607.40 - 1613.40] P:1644.56 E:0.073248 |  then when Bridge has the ball, he has less options as to who and where to pass to.
[1613.40 - 1617.40] P:1854.31 E:0.078346 |  Mr Sasevich, which foul tackled there by Bridge.
[1617.40 - 1620.40] P:1956.96 E:0.085601 |  And here's a free kick to Belarus.
[1620.40 - 1623.40] P:1956.16 E:0.079555 |  It's won by five places in from the right touch line.
[1623.40 - 1627.40] P:1909.20 E:0.077215 |  Halfway inside England half and played quickly by Petitjo,
[1627.40 - 1630.40] P:1800.24 E:0.068981 |  he's the captain at Kulchi.
[1630.40 - 1632.40] P:1730.06 E:0.077682 |  Just chipping the ball into the penalty. James Kane.
[1632.40 - 1634.40] P:1737.03 E:0.072277 |  There was no shot there.
[1634.40 - 1637.40] P:1421.80 E:0.072849 |  Burdened head of the ball away and England were lucky there again.
[1637.40 - 1639.40] P:1633.18 E:0.070787 |  Just a minor scar.
[1639.40 - 1641.40] P:1534.46 E:0.066540 |  So we're midway through the first half.
[1641.40 - 1644.40] P:1487.61 E:0.056656 |  England lead, but it's not that comfortable a lead.
[1644.40 - 1646.40] P:1641.38 E:0.052492 |  Here's my king.
[1646.40 - 1649.40] P:1631.23 E:0.075331 |  Well, I know that Fabio Capello particularly admired
[1649.40 - 1651.40] P:1755.20 E:0.078365 |  Belarus's counter attacking ability.
[1651.40 - 1655.40] P:1627.89 E:0.063563 |  And they have shown quite a bit of that so far.
[1655.40 - 1659.40] P:1765.36 E:0.071005 |  Enough certainly to disturb England, but they lead through Gerard's terrific goal.
[1659.40 - 1663.40] P:1721.49 E:0.071089 |  But here come Belarus again playing it through midfield and now with the full back near side.
[1663.40 - 1665.40] P:1633.10 E:0.054032 |  Omo Jan Cuk.
[1665.40 - 1667.40] P:1645.47 E:0.058158 |  Sasevich on the right hand side.
[1667.40 - 1669.40] P:1647.07 E:0.064013 |  Now Omo Jan Cuk again.
[1669.40 - 1671.40] P:1816.58 E:0.072893 |  They're building up slowly down this near side.
[1671.40 - 1675.40] P:1661.18 E:0.076891 |  They work the ball in and they still have possibilities in the penalty area.
[1675.40 - 1679.40] P:1789.36 E:0.072696 |  Out comes David James diving at the feet of the two soft.
[1679.40 - 1683.40] P:1715.31 E:0.068512 |  And the danger is averted, but they quite a bit of flair when they go forward.
[1683.40 - 1685.40] P:1553.42 E:0.068678 |  They have the movement about very well.
[1685.40 - 1687.40] P:1584.55 E:0.063276 |  Like they're good to watch.
[1687.40 - 1689.40] P:1616.73 E:0.063073 |  They're pleasing to the eye.
[1689.40 - 1691.40] P:1802.03 E:0.061083 |  They've had two or three shots from the edge of the box.
[1691.40 - 1695.40] P:1643.33 E:0.059862 |  But you feel that there's always a chance they could open England up.
[1695.40 - 1699.40] P:1707.60 E:0.068143 |  Mistake at the back almost there by Belarus, nearly letting in Emil Hesky.
[1699.40 - 1702.40] P:1689.20 E:0.065527 |  Emil Hesky by the way is winning his 50th cap tonight.
[1702.40 - 1704.40] P:1768.83 E:0.067858 |  Hasn't scored for England for five years.
[1704.40 - 1707.40] P:1664.55 E:0.068341 |  Stephen Gerard's winning his 70th cap.
[1707.40 - 1711.40] P:1602.49 E:0.064163 |  And he has the goal which divides the two sides here in Minsk.
[1711.40 - 1715.40] P:1587.39 E:0.070616 |  Chile evening in the capital of Belarus, but England at the moment looking good.
[1715.40 - 1719.40] P:1587.51 E:0.071128 |  Omol Jan Chuk the full back when Belarus beat England at Reading,
[1719.40 - 1723.40] P:1546.55 E:0.071839 |  the England B team before the last World Cup.
[1723.40 - 1725.40] P:1756.24 E:0.061096 |  Omol Jan Chuk was sent off in that match.
[1725.40 - 1728.40] P:1590.19 E:0.078294 |  And now Belarus bringing the ball forward through one of their centre backs.
[1728.40 - 1731.40] P:1606.03 E:0.060255 |  Vakotsov, the fast side of the field.
[1731.40 - 1733.40] P:1659.31 E:0.078573 |  England having to retreat once more.
[1733.40 - 1736.40] P:1802.95 E:0.071436 |  Belarus come forward. It should be cleared now by Wayne Bridge.
[1736.40 - 1740.40] P:1725.75 E:0.071960 |  Gerard can't control it and Belarus have possibilities once more in midfield.
[1740.40 - 1743.40] P:1657.39 E:0.066052 |  Lampard comes into win the ball and Gareth Barry.
[1743.40 - 1746.40] P:1796.63 E:0.078763 |  That was a foul by Barry, but the referee's played an advantage.
[1746.40 - 1749.40] P:1886.82 E:0.067020 |  He may well speak to Barry when the game next stops.
[1749.40 - 1752.40] P:1865.37 E:0.077745 |  Omol Jan Chuk dangerously into the area.
[1752.40 - 1755.40] P:1783.51 E:0.070053 |  Katoosofo doesn't get hold of it. It's gone wide.
[1755.40 - 1758.40] P:1762.08 E:0.074658 |  Let's see if the referee speaks to Gareth Barry. No, he doesn't.
[1758.40 - 1760.40] P:1652.51 E:0.043495 |  It's a goal kick to him.
[1761.40 - 1764.40] P:1738.67 E:0.069041 |  Just hearing that Robbie Keane has scored to the Republic of Ireland.
[1764.40 - 1766.40] P:1630.96 E:0.056939 |  Republic of Ireland won Cyprus NIL.
[1766.40 - 1768.40] P:1411.16 E:0.082038 |  Belarus are moving this ball about very well.
[1768.40 - 1772.40] P:1497.04 E:0.067641 |  England a one nil up to a very good goal from Stephen Gerard.
[1772.40 - 1774.40] P:1566.94 E:0.064584 |  But they cannot rest on their laurels.
[1774.40 - 1777.40] P:1714.59 E:0.065010 |  This looks like a good improving side.
[1777.40 - 1780.40] P:1756.69 E:0.068736 |  And certainly their combination plays excellent.
[1780.40 - 1784.40] P:1633.04 E:0.067121 |  At the moment they haven't really got right through the England defence.
[1784.40 - 1787.40] P:1653.13 E:0.060293 |  But they look as if they're capable of doing that.
[1787.40 - 1790.40] P:1659.03 E:0.071459 |  One of two of the England players not getting into the game either.
[1790.40 - 1792.40] P:1771.38 E:0.066586 |  Haven't seen very much of Frank Lampard yet.
[1792.40 - 1795.40] P:1861.80 E:0.072197 |  And certainly haven't seen very much of Theo Wolcott.
[1795.40 - 1798.40] P:1936.34 E:0.076576 |  It's a free kick. Rooney's getting a little bit annoyed once more.
[1798.40 - 1801.40] P:1917.63 E:0.067409 |  Norwegian referee's given the free kick.
[1801.40 - 1803.40] P:1724.29 E:0.067251 |  They're playing Belarus.
[1803.40 - 1806.40] P:1547.81 E:0.069461 |  And there was a poor pass out of defence up to the half way line.
[1806.40 - 1808.40] P:1675.01 E:0.064799 |  England knock it back again.
[1808.40 - 1810.40] P:1690.87 E:0.060657 |  That was a harry clearance by Upson.
[1810.40 - 1812.40] P:1634.91 E:0.068617 |  But Gerard jumps and wins it.
[1812.40 - 1814.40] P:1804.30 E:0.065364 |  And now Rooney takes on the defender near side the field.
[1814.40 - 1816.40] P:1834.76 E:0.057687 |  Rooney with a flick into midfield.
[1816.40 - 1820.40] P:1804.90 E:0.064866 |  Lampard gets there first. Lampard turns and plays it to the right.
[1820.40 - 1822.40] P:1794.19 E:0.075161 |  Brown's got it. Wolcott's waiting.
[1822.40 - 1824.40] P:1896.20 E:0.066942 |  But then Brown hit it straight at one of the Belarus players.
[1824.40 - 1826.40] P:1665.23 E:0.066575 |  And England are back inside their own half once more.
[1826.40 - 1829.40] P:1789.93 E:0.068243 |  Belarus nil England won and you're listening to Five Live.
[1829.40 - 1833.40] P:1773.30 E:0.066035 |  It's Wayne Bridge or Bridgie as Fabio Cappello called him yesterday.
[1833.40 - 1836.40] P:1776.10 E:0.069366 |  I thought we had the end of the JTs and the Stevie Gs.
[1836.40 - 1839.40] P:1745.20 E:0.077614 |  But we've got Bridgie at left back and now we've got Heskey on the ball for England.
[1839.40 - 1841.40] P:1932.66 E:0.067161 |  Turning well on the edge of the area.
[1841.40 - 1843.40] P:1871.24 E:0.077562 |  Emil Heskey turning left, turning right.
[1843.40 - 1845.40] P:1840.70 E:0.068419 |  Now on the edge of the penalty area.
[1845.40 - 1848.40] P:1686.62 E:0.072649 |  Slides it into the far post. Rooney's jumping for it.
[1848.40 - 1850.40] P:1614.87 E:0.078895 |  And almost got there as well at the far post.
[1850.40 - 1852.40] P:1771.04 E:0.070441 |  Two defenders were trying to take care of Rooney.
[1852.40 - 1854.40] P:1673.30 E:0.073737 |  He just couldn't quite squeeze the header back.
[1854.40 - 1856.40] P:1662.54 E:0.058828 |  And it's a goal kick to Belarus.
[1856.40 - 1861.40] P:1662.51 E:0.069923 |  And what we've seen there is what we saw in both the games against Croatia and Kazakhstan
[1861.40 - 1863.40] P:1713.10 E:0.067031 |  is that you know, Heskey is a problem.
[1863.40 - 1865.40] P:1172.24 E:0.067493 |  He's a big man. He holds it well.
[1865.40 - 1867.40] P:1593.70 E:0.068078 |  He's extremely well there.
[1867.40 - 1869.40] P:1387.82 E:0.074232 |  And defensively, you know, you look at Belarus now.
[1869.40 - 1873.40] P:1652.52 E:0.065509 |  Defensively, they don't look the strongest.
[1873.40 - 1877.40] P:1738.23 E:0.075006 |  It's almost 10 o'clock in the evening here in Belarus in central Europe.
[1877.40 - 1880.40] P:1651.04 E:0.064410 |  As the home side have the ball once more.
[1880.40 - 1883.40] P:1584.13 E:0.072584 |  Ever on the far side, Mollash the full back.
[1883.40 - 1885.40] P:1538.32 E:0.070742 |  Plays it back into the centre circle.
[1885.40 - 1888.40] P:1580.10 E:0.074808 |  You can hear the England fans now over on the far side.
[1888.40 - 1890.40] P:1598.02 E:0.073038 |  A couple of thousand of them certainly.
[1890.40 - 1892.40] P:1647.60 E:0.073077 |  In goes the England right back, Wes Brown.
[1892.40 - 1893.40] P:1557.40 E:0.076675 |  But he hasn't won the ball.
[1893.40 - 1896.40] P:1721.43 E:0.067851 |  But he pushes sick co-back quite well.
[1896.40 - 1899.40] P:1529.71 E:0.067892 |  And Belarus forced to go back almost to the half way line.
[1899.40 - 1902.40] P:1736.77 E:0.069305 |  Now they knock it to this near side and the full back.
[1902.40 - 1904.40] P:1715.76 E:0.068807 |  Omo Janjok once more.
[1904.40 - 1908.40] P:1734.72 E:0.071436 |  Stas Javic down the right cuts in from this near touch line.
[1908.40 - 1910.40] P:1754.15 E:0.073906 |  Stas Javic into Kochi.
[1910.40 - 1914.40] P:1785.59 E:0.078663 |  Belarus building on the edge of the England penalty area.
[1914.40 - 1915.40] P:1800.48 E:0.076140 |  It's Kochi once more.
[1915.40 - 1918.40] P:1784.44 E:0.071844 |  But England are holding them on the edge of that area.
[1918.40 - 1920.40] P:1843.03 E:0.064140 |  Belarus once more.
[1920.40 - 1922.40] P:1713.12 E:0.082236 |  A lovely zigzaggy run.
[1922.40 - 1924.40] P:1778.84 E:0.083670 |  And they shot, no, not coming yet.
[1924.40 - 1926.40] P:1758.34 E:0.084562 |  Now it's leper to the far post.
[1926.40 - 1928.40] P:1782.45 E:0.086207 |  And it's a goal for Belarus.
[1928.40 - 1930.40] P:1763.44 E:0.082971 |  And it's headed in by sick co-back.
[1930.40 - 1932.40] P:1776.86 E:0.084463 |  It was a great ball in.
[1932.40 - 1934.40] P:1705.07 E:0.087691 |  Lefordin from Stas Javic.
[1934.40 - 1936.40] P:1811.67 E:0.088051 |  England didn't pick up sick co-back at the far post.
[1936.40 - 1938.40] P:1772.92 E:0.083350 |  And that goal has been coming.
[1938.40 - 1940.40] P:1755.12 E:0.085365 |  Belarus won England one.
[1940.40 - 1942.40] P:1890.20 E:0.080849 |  I have to say this.
[1942.40 - 1943.40] P:1801.08 E:0.081853 |  It's the first class goal.
[1943.40 - 1944.40] P:1818.74 E:0.082685 |  The build up play.
[1944.40 - 1946.40] P:1761.44 E:0.087629 |  The opening up play was excellent.
[1946.40 - 1949.40] P:1843.68 E:0.084485 |  And Stas Javic actually he stepped back.
[1949.40 - 1951.40] P:1758.82 E:0.081790 |  Saw the man at the far post.
[1951.40 - 1953.40] P:1794.96 E:0.080404 |  And delivered a perfect cross.
[1953.40 - 1956.40] P:1716.44 E:0.091940 |  I mean we were saying could they open up the England defence.
[1956.40 - 1958.40] P:1800.75 E:0.085706 |  And they certainly have done.
[1958.40 - 1962.40] P:1778.91 E:0.087932 |  I don't know why but the referee has just cautioned David James.
[1962.40 - 1964.40] P:1773.14 E:0.088861 |  I'm not certain as to why that was the case.
[1964.40 - 1966.40] P:1772.16 E:0.086568 |  But that was a really good goal.
[1966.40 - 1968.40] P:1818.78 E:0.084161 |  By Belarus.
[1968.40 - 1970.40] P:1827.10 E:0.081136 |  One-one.
[1970.40 - 1974.40] P:1840.57 E:0.085832 |  England had been warned about it.
[1974.40 - 1976.40] P:1797.84 E:0.081832 |  There's no question about that.
[1976.40 - 1978.40] P:1873.90 E:0.082221 |  Belarus was starting to get a lot of the ball in midfield.
[1978.40 - 1982.40] P:1779.47 E:0.083522 |  And Stas Javic did really welcome them down the right hand side.
[1982.40 - 1984.40] P:1751.71 E:0.081047 |  And then sick co-headed it.
[1984.40 - 1986.40] P:1750.55 E:0.080426 |  I think David James has been cautioned.
[1986.40 - 1988.40] P:1839.81 E:0.077575 |  Because he's booted the ball out of the,
[1988.40 - 1990.40] P:1818.60 E:0.074166 |  probably out in the stadium.
[1990.40 - 1992.40] P:1673.69 E:0.080398 |  And they've had to get another ball.
[1992.40 - 1994.40] P:1795.80 E:0.074213 |  And so that's why David James has been cautioned.
[1994.40 - 1996.40] P:1831.48 E:0.080222 |  But it was a good goal.
[1996.40 - 1998.40] P:1746.69 E:0.081962 |  You know it's no good to say this or that.
[1998.40 - 2000.40] P:1397.80 E:0.080084 |  It was very well worked by Belarus.
[2000.40 - 2004.40] P:1730.57 E:0.076941 |  Well it's the first time that sick co has scored for his country.
[2004.40 - 2006.40] P:1682.23 E:0.078968 |  This is only his fourth cap.
[2006.40 - 2009.40] P:1682.07 E:0.071359 |  And there's a real contrast as well in that central midfield area.
[2009.40 - 2012.40] P:1726.54 E:0.084206 |  England's three in the centre have 160 caps.
[2012.40 - 2015.40] P:1841.27 E:0.083921 |  Belarus's three players between them only have 18.
[2015.40 - 2017.40] P:1748.15 E:0.082665 |  But Belarus are backing the game here.
[2017.40 - 2019.40] P:1714.96 E:0.071137 |  They came back well of course against Germany.
[2019.40 - 2021.40] P:1764.93 E:0.072065 |  And they come back here against England.
[2021.40 - 2024.40] P:1613.09 E:0.074381 |  Wolcott has a chance to run with the ball down the far side.
[2024.40 - 2025.40] P:1628.34 E:0.076082 |  Trying to link with Wayne Rooney.
[2025.40 - 2028.40] P:1764.34 E:0.067557 |  Ball is out of play. England take the throw.
[2028.40 - 2031.40] P:1765.48 E:0.076744 |  So England having been given a great start here by Stephen Gerard.
[2031.40 - 2033.40] P:1744.30 E:0.067398 |  Now have to do it all over again.
[2033.40 - 2036.40] P:1744.04 E:0.068036 |  Bridge looking to play the ball down the line to Heskey.
[2036.40 - 2040.40] P:1730.51 E:0.066949 |  Heskey turns with Omo Janczuk and in the end
[2040.40 - 2042.40] P:1656.31 E:0.073166 |  has to settle for the throw in.
[2042.40 - 2045.40] P:1636.59 E:0.077068 |  And Wayne Bridge advances and prepares to take it.
[2045.40 - 2047.40] P:1649.51 E:0.074570 |  Bridge to Barry. One one.
[2047.40 - 2049.40] P:1741.99 E:0.076770 |  Barry gives the ball away.
[2049.40 - 2053.40] P:1757.45 E:0.070650 |  And Barry and Belarus have the possession once more.
[2053.40 - 2055.40] P:1623.50 E:0.081264 |  And they've given it back to the goalkeeper
[2055.40 - 2057.40] P:1712.09 E:0.072015 |  who had to be very quick with Rooney threatening.
[2057.40 - 2058.40] P:1677.12 E:0.077037 |  Onto the half way line.
[2058.40 - 2060.40] P:1760.47 E:0.071178 |  They are very dangerous on the counter attack here.
[2060.40 - 2063.40] P:1730.08 E:0.080191 |  And now it's Lampard getting away from his marker in midfield
[2063.40 - 2065.40] P:1879.47 E:0.079092 |  in towards Rooney who's given offside.
[2065.40 - 2068.40] P:1815.53 E:0.082565 |  And I'll frustrate the Manchester United striker even more.
[2068.40 - 2070.40] P:1914.90 E:0.074899 |  How comes the goalkeeper through Kixman giving?
[2070.40 - 2075.40] P:1789.84 E:0.081439 |  I thought he was just going to hold his run but you know the Belarusian defenders
[2075.40 - 2079.40] P:1632.67 E:0.066420 |  they had little choice to go for that through pass signalled offside.
[2079.40 - 2084.40] P:1485.00 E:0.074574 |  But I have to say this at Belarus I think since going that goal down to Gerard
[2084.40 - 2086.40] P:1540.01 E:0.078268 |  they've done exceptionally well there.
[2086.40 - 2087.40] P:1491.77 E:0.070134 |  There was no dropping of the head.
[2087.40 - 2089.40] P:1629.58 E:0.084504 |  They kept playing passing and moving.
[2089.40 - 2092.40] P:1778.21 E:0.081932 |  They're giving England all sorts of problems as well over on that far side.
[2092.40 - 2093.40] P:1867.29 E:0.069455 |  Breaking.
[2093.40 - 2096.40] P:1837.80 E:0.080083 |  They need wall-cotted England I think to come back and help out
[2096.40 - 2098.40] P:1895.24 E:0.075779 |  with Wes Brown down the right-hand side.
[2098.40 - 2101.40] P:1941.50 E:0.078002 |  We've been talking about England perhaps lacking balance down the left
[2101.40 - 2104.40] P:1826.79 E:0.077148 |  but there's a lot of danger coming down that other side of the field as well.
[2104.40 - 2109.40] P:1804.59 E:0.075269 |  I think you know wall-cotted has been asked to say out very wide as the wing is doing
[2109.40 - 2110.40] P:1611.90 E:0.072605 |  right out on the touchline.
[2110.40 - 2114.40] P:1753.58 E:0.071100 |  Well that's fine but the amount of possession that the opposition are having
[2114.40 - 2117.40] P:1745.54 E:0.074629 |  means he's got to get and took himself back in there.
[2117.40 - 2119.40] P:1767.24 E:0.077499 |  Throw to Belarus but they've overrun it.
[2119.40 - 2123.40] P:1731.19 E:0.064339 |  It's won-one here in Minsk and I need to borrow Alan Green's stopwatch
[2123.40 - 2124.40] P:1705.44 E:0.071173 |  to tell you how long we've played.
[2124.40 - 2128.40] P:1716.78 E:0.063363 |  We've played exactly half an hour and we've got a real game on now.
[2128.40 - 2130.40] P:1723.13 E:0.069196 |  There is, there's no doubt about it.
[2130.40 - 2133.40] P:1667.23 E:0.071180 |  I mean and from the kickoff time you could see with Belarus
[2133.40 - 2136.40] P:1734.20 E:0.064641 |  as I said very fewers know a great deal about them
[2136.40 - 2140.40] P:1728.53 E:0.063283 |  but they look a very capable side to me.
[2140.40 - 2142.40] P:1798.97 E:0.061147 |  James takes the kick.
[2142.40 - 2145.40] P:1740.49 E:0.068992 |  Eski can't get that one he just couldn't get off the ground at all.
[2145.40 - 2148.40] P:1625.80 E:0.079250 |  Barry's lost it in the air and here comes the counter-attack once more
[2148.40 - 2151.40] P:1689.45 E:0.078198 |  from the team wearing the red shirts and the green shorts.
[2151.40 - 2154.40] P:1732.14 E:0.075984 |  Belarus near side, ball skinned into the area
[2154.40 - 2156.40] P:1733.23 E:0.069372 |  and Ferdinand heads it away.
[2156.40 - 2160.40] P:1626.26 E:0.068377 |  He'll have to show all of his experience and quality other than these next 10-15 minutes.
[2160.40 - 2162.40] P:1622.06 E:0.067976 |  In goes Upson quickly to win the ball
[2162.40 - 2164.40] P:1613.10 E:0.060728 |  and now Barry, not much on for him.
[2164.40 - 2168.40] P:1650.34 E:0.074335 |  Barry, a hopeless pass though, could have held on to it a little longer.
[2168.40 - 2169.40] P:1807.06 E:0.069409 |  He played it to this near side.
[2169.40 - 2171.40] P:1785.91 E:0.077937 |  There was no way that Bridge was going to get it
[2171.40 - 2174.40] P:1694.34 E:0.069894 |  and it's a throw once more and out comes Javier Capello
[2174.40 - 2177.40] P:1694.63 E:0.064528 |  just making sort of calming gestures to his side.
[2177.40 - 2181.40] P:1688.68 E:0.072203 |  It's coming up into the technical areas they call standing there.
[2181.40 - 2184.40] P:1178.90 E:0.075523 |  One's coming up but not a lot he can do at the moment
[2184.40 - 2188.40] P:1827.82 E:0.069594 |  with the way that Belarus commanding the game.
[2188.40 - 2191.40] P:1925.30 E:0.081770 |  Well Korshi, who really is the most experienced player
[2191.40 - 2193.40] P:1807.36 E:0.075195 |  just took a tumble there but he's OK.
[2193.40 - 2195.40] P:1794.27 E:0.073710 |  He's winning tonight his 73rd cap.
[2195.40 - 2199.40] P:1770.53 E:0.064233 |  He's the second most cap player in the history of Belarus football
[2199.40 - 2201.40] P:1710.26 E:0.066614 |  and he's only 7 away from the record.
[2201.40 - 2203.40] P:1590.86 E:0.066406 |  England building from inside their own half
[2203.40 - 2206.40] P:1735.52 E:0.064249 |  playing from right to left here in the first half in Minsk
[2206.40 - 2208.40] P:1701.63 E:0.067739 |  and a battle on for them now.
[2208.40 - 2210.40] P:1759.70 E:0.067527 |  It's 1-1 having had a great start from Gerard Skal.
[2210.40 - 2212.40] P:1773.85 E:0.065250 |  Alan Green got it absolutely right.
[2212.40 - 2215.40] P:1673.40 E:0.071418 |  He really passed it almost into the net from distance
[2215.40 - 2216.40] P:1799.68 E:0.081183 |  to give England the lead.
[2216.40 - 2218.40] P:1818.35 E:0.078640 |  England haven't been able to build on it.
[2218.40 - 2221.40] P:1839.32 E:0.070594 |  Wolcott's not in the game and Belarus fully deserved to come back.
[2221.40 - 2223.40] P:1707.56 E:0.069573 |  As a header from Heskey was looking for Rooney
[2223.40 - 2226.40] P:1771.00 E:0.074538 |  the ball is played back to the Belarus goalkeeper
[2226.40 - 2229.40] P:1702.84 E:0.067392 |  and he just about gets it out of the penalty area
[2229.40 - 2232.40] P:1712.39 E:0.065661 |  and the clearance is completed by Molloch.
[2232.40 - 2234.40] P:1640.52 E:0.068898 |  Nice touches on the half way line.
[2234.40 - 2237.40] P:1774.34 E:0.070003 |  These two front players have a very good understanding for Belarus.
[2237.40 - 2239.40] P:1686.52 E:0.065098 |  England now look to Lampard.
[2239.40 - 2241.40] P:1772.50 E:0.068520 |  Hit quickly and high to the far side.
[2241.40 - 2242.40] P:1583.45 E:0.067362 |  Wolcott brings it down.
[2242.40 - 2244.40] P:1832.20 E:0.073746 |  Wolcott's falling into the area.
[2244.40 - 2245.40] P:1775.10 E:0.067487 |  Aim towards Heskey.
[2245.40 - 2247.40] P:1807.03 E:0.070777 |  Gerard's got it back again for England.
[2247.40 - 2249.40] P:1811.88 E:0.080462 |  Rooney stretches well on the edge of the area.
[2249.40 - 2251.40] P:1877.08 E:0.078415 |  Need some support here, Wayne Rooney.
[2251.40 - 2253.40] P:1808.27 E:0.077449 |  Rooney's looking for a bridge down the left.
[2253.40 - 2255.40] P:1773.38 E:0.078478 |  In the area it goes towards Lampard
[2255.40 - 2257.40] P:1852.58 E:0.065776 |  who gets in ahead of the Belarus defender.
[2257.40 - 2259.40] P:1899.85 E:0.073020 |  Now can Bridge cross this from the England left hand side.
[2259.40 - 2261.40] P:1831.63 E:0.068829 |  Takes it to the dead ball line
[2261.40 - 2263.40] P:1867.93 E:0.067907 |  and has to settle for the corner kick.
[2263.40 - 2265.40] P:1588.77 E:0.084031 |  A little bit better play by England there.
[2265.40 - 2268.40] P:1599.44 E:0.071845 |  They maintained possession of the ball for a longer period
[2268.40 - 2271.40] P:1703.14 E:0.065987 |  than they'd been able to do in the opening stages.
[2271.40 - 2274.40] P:1793.67 E:0.070549 |  And so Ferdinand and Upsen and Brown
[2274.40 - 2276.40] P:1827.19 E:0.069803 |  having had to do a fair amount of defending
[2276.40 - 2278.40] P:1878.94 E:0.075309 |  and now make their way into the penalty area
[2278.40 - 2281.40] P:1922.77 E:0.077798 |  to try and get on the end of this England corner kick.
[2281.40 - 2283.40] P:1910.98 E:0.074857 |  Into Heskey and that's headed wide.
[2283.40 - 2286.40] P:1667.43 E:0.068212 |  He got up well at the near post but headed it wide.
[2286.40 - 2289.40] P:1616.88 E:0.066491 |  I think that was a chance and there's no doubt about it.
[2289.40 - 2292.40] P:1436.16 E:0.072404 |  Putting the ball into the boxes we've seen in the games
[2292.40 - 2295.40] P:1612.15 E:0.068375 |  against Kazakhstan as against Croatia causes problems.
[2295.40 - 2298.40] P:1496.65 E:0.069960 |  The one thing I'd say against Belarus
[2298.40 - 2301.40] P:1572.00 E:0.070179 |  I'd be uncertain about their central defenders
[2301.40 - 2305.40] P:1605.45 E:0.074881 |  whether they can defend as well as they should be able to do
[2305.40 - 2306.40] P:1632.21 E:0.070567 |  at this level.
[2306.40 - 2309.40] P:1677.57 E:0.071746 |  But as a team they have created problems for England
[2309.40 - 2311.40] P:1467.49 E:0.064550 |  when they moved the ball about.
[2311.40 - 2315.40] P:1751.06 E:0.071382 |  12 minutes to go in this lively first half here in Minsk.
[2315.40 - 2318.40] P:1591.54 E:0.073762 |  Belarus won, England won, Rooney on the half way line.
[2318.40 - 2320.40] P:1744.38 E:0.080420 |  Trying to release Walcott.
[2320.40 - 2322.40] P:1631.72 E:0.070866 |  It's just a little far in front of Walcott
[2322.40 - 2326.40] P:1874.78 E:0.066765 |  and the goalkeepers out quickly for Belarus to make the save.
[2328.40 - 2330.40] P:1797.71 E:0.079641 |  Let's just check on the game between Germany and Wales
[2330.40 - 2331.40] P:1616.96 E:0.067853 |  with Conor McNamara.
[2331.40 - 2334.40] P:1700.58 E:0.076967 |  18.5 minutes played. Germany nil, Wales nil.
[2334.40 - 2337.40] P:1737.85 E:0.080283 |  Craig Bellamy went for a goal, directly on the kickoff.
[2337.40 - 2340.40] P:1738.16 E:0.071878 |  His shot from the centre circle was predictably well wide.
[2340.40 - 2343.40] P:1843.48 E:0.079957 |  That's the only time the ball has been anywhere near the German penalty area
[2343.40 - 2345.40] P:1617.84 E:0.072901 |  but Wales absorbing pressure well.
[2345.40 - 2347.40] P:1860.51 E:0.065262 |  Germany nil, Wales nil.
[2347.40 - 2348.40] P:1783.15 E:0.055646 |  Thank you very much here.
[2348.40 - 2352.40] P:1812.68 E:0.071054 |  England seem to be sort of wrong footed really by Strasievic.
[2352.40 - 2353.40] P:1696.50 E:0.077491 |  I thought he was going to get the cross in
[2353.40 - 2355.40] P:1651.40 E:0.069094 |  then he seemed to pull it back and then
[2355.40 - 2358.40] P:1804.60 E:0.063216 |  the delayed cross seemed to catch England off guard
[2358.40 - 2360.40] P:1787.68 E:0.072862 |  and in came Sick Cote ahead in at the far post.
[2360.40 - 2363.40] P:1621.14 E:0.067676 |  But on balance of play in the first half
[2364.40 - 2367.40] P:1806.28 E:0.069515 |  Belarus probably deserved to be level with England as they are here.
[2367.40 - 2369.40] P:1774.77 E:0.069817 |  Upsen takes a free kickoff, refiled by Heskey.
[2369.40 - 2371.40] P:1817.00 E:0.067319 |  Heskey trying to head it on to Rooney.
[2371.40 - 2373.40] P:1671.47 E:0.072533 |  Income the challenges from Belarus, committed
[2373.40 - 2377.40] P:1582.94 E:0.067588 |  and they win the ball back and it's dangerous every time they get it forward.
[2377.40 - 2380.40] P:1743.21 E:0.074772 |  Rio Ferdinand gets his foot in but back come Belarus once more
[2380.40 - 2382.40] P:1849.44 E:0.071821 |  and they are working it well through the centre
[2382.40 - 2386.40] P:1728.88 E:0.073184 |  and also from the flax and Belarus crossed the half way line
[2386.40 - 2388.40] P:1728.71 E:0.080340 |  and there's more for England to do here.
[2388.40 - 2390.40] P:1759.42 E:0.069770 |  It's the golf scorer Sick Cote.
[2390.40 - 2392.40] P:1777.76 E:0.074494 |  Sick Cote drives it straight at Gareth Barry
[2392.40 - 2394.40] P:1683.87 E:0.078177 |  wasted opportunity there for the home side
[2394.40 - 2396.40] P:1746.19 E:0.063810 |  now can England counter attack.
[2396.40 - 2398.40] P:1694.71 E:0.065754 |  Gerard has to be careful not to be caught in possession.
[2398.40 - 2400.40] P:1719.06 E:0.068165 |  Gives it back to Upsen who gives a safety first ball
[2400.40 - 2402.40] P:1749.89 E:0.071686 |  to west brown down the right
[2402.40 - 2404.40] P:1695.83 E:0.056705 |  and now Lampard picks up the possession.
[2404.40 - 2406.40] P:1697.86 E:0.061897 |  Lampard for England, short of the half way line.
[2406.40 - 2408.40] P:1675.25 E:0.061664 |  Lampard playing down the right hand side
[2408.40 - 2410.40] P:1692.10 E:0.066759 |  decides he can't go forward
[2410.40 - 2412.40] P:1865.54 E:0.074899 |  and gives it back to David James
[2412.40 - 2414.40] P:1949.93 E:0.076113 |  and inevitably gets a few boos from the home fans.
[2414.40 - 2416.40] P:1926.00 E:0.071174 |  James Clearance down the centre.
[2416.40 - 2418.40] P:1788.15 E:0.076676 |  Heskey and Rooney together but there's an offside
[2418.40 - 2420.40] P:1715.05 E:0.068245 |  given against England and we'll check on
[2420.40 - 2422.40] P:1620.59 E:0.073425 |  the Northern Ireland's progress against San Marino
[2422.40 - 2424.40] P:1665.22 E:0.066189 |  from Ian Dennis.
[2424.40 - 2426.40] P:1542.14 E:0.081236 |  It's played Northern Ireland Mil San Marino
[2426.40 - 2428.40] P:1666.28 E:0.077069 |  and it's been a scratch performance so far
[2428.40 - 2430.40] P:1622.43 E:0.079782 |  from Northern Ireland, lots of possession
[2430.40 - 2432.40] P:1600.99 E:0.071274 |  but four distribution in the final third
[2432.40 - 2434.40] P:1937.80 E:0.069492 |  O'Connor's header has dropped wide, Mil nil.
[2434.40 - 2436.40] P:1938.14 E:0.077619 |  Thank you very much indeed.
[2436.40 - 2438.40] P:1952.12 E:0.081013 |  Now there's a wild challenge on Emile Heskey
[2438.40 - 2440.40] P:1956.33 E:0.078472 |  by Omol Janshok.
[2440.40 - 2442.40] P:1875.25 E:0.077504 |  He was the player I said earlier who was sent off
[2442.40 - 2444.40] P:1921.06 E:0.069440 |  the last time the Belarus team played England
[2444.40 - 2446.40] P:1889.13 E:0.069417 |  in the game at Reading.
[2446.40 - 2448.40] P:1829.09 E:0.069549 |  Heskey's going to be okay I think
[2448.40 - 2450.40] P:1733.84 E:0.071563 |  but he can now get a number of players forward
[2450.40 - 2452.40] P:1812.18 E:0.063436 |  because Gerard has this.
[2452.40 - 2454.40] P:1620.91 E:0.077135 |  This is 30 yards away from the Belarus goal.
[2454.40 - 2456.40] P:1722.94 E:0.068462 |  Lampard's not very far away either
[2456.40 - 2458.40] P:1587.15 E:0.057559 |  and Gareth Barry, there's a little threesome there
[2458.40 - 2460.40] P:1664.96 E:0.082585 |  around the ball.
[2460.40 - 2462.40] P:1606.34 E:0.057390 |  Heskey and Rooney on the edge of the area.
[2462.40 - 2464.40] P:1618.23 E:0.053443 |  Ferdinand's gone forward too.
[2464.40 - 2466.40] P:1695.98 E:0.076378 |  Just the full backs are staying back.
[2466.40 - 2468.40] P:1805.37 E:0.064000 |  Capallo still stands down there.
[2468.40 - 2470.40] P:1830.46 E:0.046868 |  Won't be happy by the way that Belarus
[2470.40 - 2472.40] P:1516.54 E:0.085505 |  have come back into this game.
[2472.40 - 2474.40] P:1772.57 E:0.071887 |  England have the early initiative.
[2474.40 - 2476.40] P:1884.33 E:0.069036 |  Now it's 1-1 in Misk.
[2476.40 - 2478.40] P:1883.39 E:0.052585 |  Gerard has peeled away.
[2478.40 - 2480.40] P:1890.09 E:0.061677 |  Lampard drives it in and the goalkeeper
[2480.40 - 2482.40] P:1870.50 E:0.068991 |  who might have seen it late
[2482.40 - 2484.40] P:1726.95 E:0.082019 |  goes down to hold on to the ball.
[2484.40 - 2486.40] P:1788.08 E:0.075524 |  Yes, Chef Knopp in the Belarus goal
[2486.40 - 2488.40] P:1870.19 E:0.070525 |  did very well there because I think
[2488.40 - 2490.40] P:1544.33 E:0.082598 |  like you Mike you did see it late.
[2490.40 - 2492.40] P:1552.43 E:0.078016 |  He got down and collected it comfortably.
[2492.40 - 2494.40] P:1726.84 E:0.066736 |  Belarus won England one.
[2494.40 - 2496.40] P:1681.43 E:0.069545 |  And Catoosal
[2496.40 - 2498.40] P:1635.37 E:0.053743 |  who's been particularly impressive.
[2498.40 - 2500.40] P:1700.66 E:0.068028 |  He's been playing behind
[2500.40 - 2502.40] P:1584.66 E:0.064713 |  Bully Gar
[2502.40 - 2504.40] P:1580.16 E:0.060810 |  and he's been playing behind
[2504.40 - 2506.40] P:1518.61 E:0.057274 |  Bully Gar
[2506.40 - 2508.40] P:1554.41 E:0.068655 |  and he's got very clever feet
[2508.40 - 2510.40] P:1577.68 E:0.068243 |  and England have had a few problems picking him up.
[2510.40 - 2512.40] P:1668.67 E:0.060977 |  The ball is now back again with the
[2512.40 - 2514.40] P:1552.61 E:0.075819 |  England goalkeeper David James on a yellow card
[2514.40 - 2516.40] P:1768.61 E:0.062749 |  in this game.
[2516.40 - 2518.40] P:1634.94 E:0.066420 |  Heskey by the way is carrying a yellow card
[2518.40 - 2520.40] P:1705.69 E:0.066307 |  in this qualifying group if he was to get another one tonight.
[2520.40 - 2522.40] P:1748.99 E:0.073751 |  The next game by the way is not until the first of April
[2522.40 - 2524.40] P:1680.21 E:0.066556 |  at home to Ukraine.
[2524.40 - 2526.40] P:1699.66 E:0.058181 |  Ukraine and Croatia hoping for England to slip up here
[2526.40 - 2528.40] P:1675.19 E:0.064437 |  in Misk.
[2528.40 - 2530.40] P:1670.50 E:0.054154 |  Heskey heads the ball on.
[2530.40 - 2532.40] P:1617.11 E:0.064402 |  Gerard will try and get that down this near side
[2532.40 - 2534.40] P:1703.36 E:0.064332 |  and in the end it's a throw into England.
[2534.40 - 2536.40] P:1707.21 E:0.050608 |  Bridge steps forward.
[2536.40 - 2538.40] P:1815.27 E:0.059390 |  Gerard hands in the ball.
[2538.40 - 2540.40] P:1555.63 E:0.069579 |  Rooney and Heskey in the area.
[2540.40 - 2542.40] P:1780.37 E:0.064503 |  Walcott lurks just on the edge.
[2542.40 - 2544.40] P:1863.90 E:0.058617 |  Won one in Misk.
[2544.40 - 2546.40] P:1814.62 E:0.052042 |  We played now 37 minutes of the first half.
[2546.40 - 2548.40] P:1849.87 E:0.069981 |  It's bridged by the corner flag near side
[2548.40 - 2550.40] P:1832.08 E:0.058177 |  for England.
[2550.40 - 2552.40] P:1839.16 E:0.054378 |  Bridge with a porridge ball really
[2552.40 - 2554.40] P:1712.93 E:0.078475 |  into the penalty area which is easily cleared
[2554.40 - 2556.40] P:1722.47 E:0.077780 |  by Kilpenko and
[2556.40 - 2558.40] P:1698.39 E:0.052279 |  Lampard
[2558.40 - 2560.40] P:1640.85 E:0.061778 |  up some desperate for the ball to go out of play.
[2560.40 - 2562.40] P:1801.02 E:0.063735 |  Didn't.
[2562.40 - 2564.40] P:1728.36 E:0.069108 |  And now Ferdinand hits it high.
[2564.40 - 2566.40] P:1565.67 E:0.071841 |  England need to get Walcott more on the ball.
[2566.40 - 2568.40] P:1763.00 E:0.069822 |  Walcott's got it. Takes it initially with his head.
[2568.40 - 2570.40] P:1684.22 E:0.062206 |  Now he's taking on the fallback by the corner flag
[2570.40 - 2572.40] P:1740.23 E:0.062483 |  and England have a throw in by the corner flag
[2572.40 - 2574.40] P:1685.61 E:0.065963 |  over on the far side which is the England right.
[2574.40 - 2576.40] P:1605.39 E:0.064688 |  Really haven't had many opportunities
[2576.40 - 2578.40] P:1644.82 E:0.064829 |  for Walcott to run at the defenders here.
[2578.40 - 2580.40] P:1768.07 E:0.054321 |  Ball thrown back to
[2580.40 - 2582.40] P:1672.29 E:0.064885 |  Lampard who makes a mess of that.
[2582.40 - 2584.40] P:1723.23 E:0.069746 |  Now this is always the danger.
[2584.40 - 2586.40] P:1731.69 E:0.077869 |  When England lose possession, Belarus are very quick to counter
[2586.40 - 2588.40] P:1760.10 E:0.066653 |  but not on that occasion England have another
[2588.40 - 2590.40] P:1636.04 E:0.060642 |  throw in and Brown is there to take it for them.
[2590.40 - 2592.40] P:1609.37 E:0.067280 |  Rooney runs out of the penalty area.
[2592.40 - 2594.40] P:1777.40 E:0.052097 |  England throw in taken.
[2594.40 - 2596.40] P:1730.65 E:0.057638 |  The ball is lifted forward
[2596.40 - 2598.40] P:1680.20 E:0.071016 |  towards Rooney but it was a poor pass
[2598.40 - 2600.40] P:1656.19 E:0.064072 |  in the end from Garth Barry straight
[2600.40 - 2602.40] P:1827.91 E:0.068719 |  through to the goalkeeper.
[2602.40 - 2604.40] P:1638.22 E:0.073668 |  There's no doubt in my mind that Belarus are a very capable side.
[2604.40 - 2606.40] P:1702.66 E:0.063042 |  They've shown that by how they've played,
[2606.40 - 2608.40] P:1577.66 E:0.062992 |  how they've taken the ball to England
[2608.40 - 2610.40] P:1283.38 E:0.075452 |  and opened the moot.
[2610.40 - 2612.40] P:1713.15 E:0.072173 |  But on the same base I am a little bit suspicious
[2612.40 - 2614.40] P:1767.09 E:0.066629 |  about their defensive capabilities.
[2614.40 - 2616.40] P:1642.65 E:0.061321 |  And because of that I think there will always
[2616.40 - 2618.40] P:1601.20 E:0.078306 |  be an opportunity for England to get another goal.
[2618.40 - 2620.40] P:1607.86 E:0.069068 |  They're almost at their most dangerous
[2620.40 - 2622.40] P:1737.54 E:0.065422 |  Belarus when England have the ball
[2622.40 - 2624.40] P:1714.04 E:0.077169 |  because if England lose possession in midfield
[2624.40 - 2626.40] P:1814.30 E:0.070106 |  then Belarus get forward very quickly
[2626.40 - 2628.40] P:1730.03 E:0.066129 |  using the wide players particularly
[2628.40 - 2630.40] P:1700.44 E:0.069017 |  well and a throw in now to Belarus
[2630.40 - 2632.40] P:1717.72 E:0.073056 |  down this near side who
[2632.40 - 2634.40] P:1765.45 E:0.068134 |  obviously now are getting fantastic support
[2634.40 - 2636.40] P:1709.34 E:0.061536 |  from the home fans having come back
[2636.40 - 2638.40] P:1710.33 E:0.072952 |  into this game without headed equalizer
[2638.40 - 2640.40] P:1600.29 E:0.067335 |  from Sicko.
[2640.40 - 2642.40] P:1695.39 E:0.071057 |  Throw into Belarus England win it back again.
[2642.40 - 2644.40] P:1632.03 E:0.064749 |  They're almost at their most dangerous
[2644.40 - 2646.40] P:1809.14 E:0.078567 |  throw into Belarus England win it back again.
[2646.40 - 2648.40] P:1872.31 E:0.072237 |  Gerard they just lose their shape from it at England.
[2648.40 - 2650.40] P:1869.17 E:0.066617 |  Gerard trying to find Heskey.
[2650.40 - 2652.40] P:1694.95 E:0.073674 |  Heskey toes the ball on to Wolcott
[2652.40 - 2654.40] P:1593.09 E:0.077501 |  but I don't think Wolcott will get there.
[2654.40 - 2656.40] P:1832.01 E:0.072516 |  Out comes the goalkeeper in the nick of time
[2656.40 - 2658.40] P:1859.82 E:0.073045 |  and just manages to thrush it to safety over on the far side.
[2658.40 - 2660.40] P:1761.48 E:0.084299 |  Well certainly with the release of Wolcott
[2660.40 - 2662.40] P:1669.84 E:0.074131 |  and we've seen England trying to do that
[2662.40 - 2664.40] P:1765.04 E:0.055894 |  on a number of occasions in this half.
[2664.40 - 2666.40] P:1511.45 E:0.060962 |  On that time I thought that Wolcott would get there
[2666.40 - 2668.40] P:1213.00 E:0.068108 |  but the goalkeeper read it very well
[2668.40 - 2670.40] P:1673.98 E:0.065194 |  and just nicked it in front of him.
[2670.40 - 2672.40] P:1847.78 E:0.077688 |  One one here as Brown finds Rooney
[2672.40 - 2674.40] P:1732.96 E:0.072168 |  and the ball is behind Heskey.
[2674.40 - 2676.40] P:1786.38 E:0.075174 |  Belarus trying to clear.
[2676.40 - 2678.40] P:1777.91 E:0.070242 |  Graham Taylor would like to see England putting more pressure
[2678.40 - 2680.40] P:1686.21 E:0.056873 |  on this Belarus back for.
[2680.40 - 2682.40] P:1745.90 E:0.070130 |  Gerard's got the ball trading passes with Barry.
[2682.40 - 2684.40] P:1854.64 E:0.072754 |  Now bit of space for Ferdinand inside the centre circle.
[2684.40 - 2686.40] P:1749.32 E:0.069233 |  Suddenly a little bit better from England.
[2686.40 - 2688.40] P:1842.29 E:0.071340 |  Ball played into Rooney who comes to the defender.
[2688.40 - 2690.40] P:1828.39 E:0.078874 |  Rooney looking for Wolcott in the area.
[2690.40 - 2692.40] P:1802.86 E:0.077285 |  Wolcott's tapering the oh no he's not he can't take it past.
[2692.40 - 2694.40] P:1738.25 E:0.080378 |  Terrific defending on that occasion from Belarus.
[2694.40 - 2696.40] P:1780.68 E:0.083858 |  I thought Wolcott was going to run through there.
[2696.40 - 2698.40] P:1791.37 E:0.075669 |  And now this is the danger again.
[2698.40 - 2700.40] P:1778.48 E:0.067888 |  For England it's Belarus
[2700.40 - 2702.40] P:1852.45 E:0.079335 |  on the counter attack.
[2702.40 - 2704.40] P:1784.16 E:0.068046 |  Ferdinand's waiting for them though.
[2704.40 - 2706.40] P:1553.23 E:0.069758 |  Wolcott comes inside the fallback
[2706.40 - 2708.40] P:1784.36 E:0.072988 |  and he's on the charge again.
[2708.40 - 2710.40] P:1793.66 E:0.079143 |  Wolcott going forward for England.
[2710.40 - 2712.40] P:1780.14 E:0.079687 |  Wolcott shot it straight at the goalkeeper.
[2712.40 - 2714.40] P:1930.78 E:0.074403 |  Should have pulled it across the face.
[2714.40 - 2716.40] P:1611.92 E:0.073346 |  Rooney coming in looking very despondent there.
[2716.40 - 2718.40] P:1493.34 E:0.061553 |  Ball was pulled back across the face of the goal.
[2718.40 - 2720.40] P:1533.01 E:0.070689 |  But we have seen the threat of Wolcott.
[2720.40 - 2722.40] P:1316.08 E:0.061963 |  There's no doubt about it.
[2722.40 - 2724.40] P:1477.68 E:0.076294 |  Earlier Filipeko got a great
[2724.40 - 2726.40] P:1414.00 E:0.065589 |  tattle on him and brought it out to
[2726.40 - 2728.40] P:1558.30 E:0.064668 |  young central defender for Belarus.
[2728.40 - 2730.40] P:1702.47 E:0.071706 |  After Zagreb we have high expectations every time
[2730.40 - 2732.40] P:1578.78 E:0.067813 |  Wolcott's on the ball.
[2732.40 - 2734.40] P:1641.53 E:0.076577 |  Belarus won England one as we moved
[2734.40 - 2736.40] P:1691.44 E:0.067803 |  towards halftime. Four minutes to go
[2736.40 - 2738.40] P:1668.22 E:0.063910 |  in the first half here in Mints.
[2738.40 - 2740.40] P:1735.86 E:0.067635 |  England in front through Gerard.
[2740.40 - 2742.40] P:1746.06 E:0.069623 |  Terrific strike equaliser from Belarus
[2742.40 - 2744.40] P:1568.78 E:0.063096 |  from Sitko, header at the far post.
[2744.40 - 2746.40] P:1689.28 E:0.059390 |  England now looking to try and
[2746.40 - 2748.40] P:1493.97 E:0.058582 |  make a break in the Belarus half.
[2748.40 - 2750.40] P:1614.92 E:0.078497 |  But Belarus launch a high ball forward
[2750.40 - 2752.40] P:1658.98 E:0.069194 |  and it's given away by Gareth Barry.
[2752.40 - 2754.40] P:1732.23 E:0.074183 |  That was loose by England midfield
[2754.40 - 2756.40] P:1619.93 E:0.077676 |  but then given away by Belarus.
[2756.40 - 2758.40] P:1754.17 E:0.065666 |  And England take advantage.
[2758.40 - 2760.40] P:1817.29 E:0.069404 |  Brown now just inside the Belarus half.
[2760.40 - 2762.40] P:1825.87 E:0.068458 |  Trying to find Gerard. Brown's pass wasn't great.
[2762.40 - 2764.40] P:1806.10 E:0.070396 |  Rooney will try and win it back for England.
[2764.40 - 2766.40] P:1666.81 E:0.081326 |  The ball breaks away to the left.
[2766.40 - 2768.40] P:1673.36 E:0.062376 |  England appeal for a corner kick.
[2768.40 - 2770.40] P:1836.49 E:0.060001 |  But the goal kick is given to the
[2770.40 - 2772.40] P:1665.75 E:0.073457 |  man in yellow, Zevnoff.
[2772.40 - 2774.40] P:1772.49 E:0.062810 |  Goal kick to Belarus.
[2774.40 - 2776.40] P:1626.65 E:0.061620 |  And there's a fair amount for Fabio Capello
[2776.40 - 2778.40] P:1673.89 E:0.073360 |  to try and sort out at halftime here.
[2778.40 - 2780.40] P:1457.84 E:0.073671 |  There's no doubt about that as well.
[2780.40 - 2782.40] P:1703.27 E:0.068291 |  Because they say the controlled play
[2782.40 - 2784.40] P:1610.95 E:0.069151 |  of Belarus, controlled possession
[2784.40 - 2786.40] P:1786.25 E:0.068793 |  of the ball has been excellent.
[2786.40 - 2788.40] P:1732.57 E:0.071130 |  And they certainly know a disturbed England.
[2788.40 - 2790.40] P:1732.63 E:0.061689 |  This is the first time that Belarus
[2790.40 - 2792.40] P:1694.88 E:0.077571 |  have played at home in the group.
[2792.40 - 2794.40] P:1754.19 E:0.053446 |  Had a couple of away games.
[2794.40 - 2796.40] P:1756.90 E:0.069934 |  They actually were taken a long way
[2796.40 - 2798.40] P:1847.24 E:0.063661 |  in the match with Andorra.
[2798.40 - 2800.40] P:1703.25 E:0.078980 |  It was one-one until the later stages.
[2800.40 - 2802.40] P:1690.53 E:0.076796 |  Then Belarus won it three-one.
[2802.40 - 2804.40] P:1613.34 E:0.060126 |  And Anand was saying earlier
[2804.40 - 2806.40] P:1398.64 E:0.076232 |  that the defeat in Kiev was harsh on them.
[2806.40 - 2808.40] P:1696.28 E:0.065334 |  They lost to a penalty in added time
[2808.40 - 2810.40] P:1610.72 E:0.065310 |  at the end of the match from Shedchenko.
[2810.40 - 2812.40] P:1593.40 E:0.057651 |  One-one here in Belarus.
[2812.40 - 2814.40] P:1651.39 E:0.061172 |  Belarus working it through the defence.
[2814.40 - 2816.40] P:1681.24 E:0.069458 |  And the fair head for Kotsoff
[2816.40 - 2818.40] P:1500.33 E:0.055650 |  who gives it back once more to goalkeeper
[2818.40 - 2820.40] P:1615.61 E:0.064645 |  Zevnoff.
[2820.40 - 2822.40] P:1625.90 E:0.051291 |  Zevnoff right footed into the England half.
[2822.40 - 2824.40] P:1606.72 E:0.056825 |  It should be headed back by Upsen.
[2824.40 - 2826.40] P:1671.73 E:0.072433 |  Upsen's ball and a header from Lampard.
[2826.40 - 2828.40] P:1429.03 E:0.059320 |  Heskey and Lampard.
[2828.40 - 2830.40] P:1305.15 E:0.051804 |  And now Gerard.
[2830.40 - 2832.40] P:1693.13 E:0.076865 |  Gerard to Barry.
[2832.40 - 2834.40] P:1826.58 E:0.065480 |  Barry looking for Bridge.
[2834.40 - 2836.40] P:1706.10 E:0.074153 |  Here comes Wayne Bridge for England.
[2836.40 - 2838.40] P:1828.62 E:0.064945 |  Down the near side, a left.
[2838.40 - 2840.40] P:1844.94 E:0.064918 |  Rooney and Heskey on the edge of the area.
[2840.40 - 2842.40] P:1615.45 E:0.078064 |  And the ball from...
[2842.40 - 2844.40] P:1735.87 E:0.074781 |  Actually, I didn't think it was a great ball from Bridge
[2844.40 - 2846.40] P:1835.52 E:0.066023 |  but there was ball watching at the back there
[2846.40 - 2848.40] P:1494.27 E:0.076273 |  and they were hesitant and almost led in wall-cott
[2848.40 - 2850.40] P:1487.49 E:0.064376 |  but the ball breaks away for Golkin.
[2850.40 - 2852.40] P:1553.88 E:0.069522 |  But I think, Mike, if Belarus aren't careful
[2852.40 - 2854.40] P:1312.77 E:0.064763 |  that is what will let them down.
[2854.40 - 2856.40] P:1393.24 E:0.063702 |  I'm not certain about that back four.
[2856.40 - 2858.40] P:1550.17 E:0.069721 |  We saw it there.
[2858.40 - 2860.40] P:1459.04 E:0.070758 |  We're not the greatest of balls from Wayne Bridge
[2860.40 - 2862.40] P:1554.40 E:0.062002 |  in the air coming across.
[2862.40 - 2864.40] P:1588.03 E:0.073858 |  No Belarus player,
[2864.40 - 2866.40] P:1560.55 E:0.063916 |  no defender took responsibility for it.
[2866.40 - 2868.40] P:1556.31 E:0.067006 |  And I think that will create
[2868.40 - 2870.40] P:1733.80 E:0.054376 |  one or two chances for England.
[2870.40 - 2872.40] P:1673.85 E:0.077486 |  Graham Taylor, England's former manager
[2872.40 - 2874.40] P:1707.96 E:0.059539 |  with us here in Minsk tonight.
[2874.40 - 2876.40] P:1636.05 E:0.071618 |  For a very interesting game,
[2876.40 - 2878.40] P:1611.18 E:0.078099 |  Wangwan as Lampard now looks into getting more of the ball
[2878.40 - 2880.40] P:1700.31 E:0.064305 |  towards wall-cott.
[2880.40 - 2882.40] P:1707.90 E:0.070005 |  No, that's an instruction from Capello.
[2882.40 - 2884.40] P:1514.60 E:0.071273 |  Wall-cott down the right turning, needs some help here.
[2884.40 - 2886.40] P:1647.95 E:0.069286 |  There was no one to give it to.
[2886.40 - 2888.40] P:1741.71 E:0.070345 |  Belarus have won it back again.
[2888.40 - 2890.40] P:1728.60 E:0.073412 |  Gerard though trying to get England back in business
[2890.40 - 2892.40] P:1830.07 E:0.064464 |  and the end Belarus have to give it back to the keeper
[2892.40 - 2894.40] P:1708.81 E:0.073423 |  as Rooney comes charging in
[2894.40 - 2896.40] P:1610.91 E:0.065021 |  and now a high ball into the England half
[2896.40 - 2898.40] P:1703.41 E:0.070705 |  and it's the dangerous Strasievic.
[2898.40 - 2900.40] P:1750.03 E:0.071931 |  The man who supplied the cross for the goal.
[2900.40 - 2902.40] P:1785.23 E:0.065134 |  Free kick has been given against England
[2902.40 - 2904.40] P:1861.67 E:0.068617 |  inside the centre circle.
[2904.40 - 2906.40] P:1773.30 E:0.076843 |  Two Belarus, we've got a minute and a half
[2906.40 - 2908.40] P:1853.48 E:0.066301 |  of normal time to go in this first half.
[2908.40 - 2910.40] P:1660.40 E:0.076361 |  It's been a very interesting half, there's no doubt about that.
[2910.40 - 2912.40] P:1625.91 E:0.057268 |  I think it's about right the score line.
[2912.40 - 2914.40] P:1659.78 E:0.059368 |  Although Belarus have certainly had the greater
[2914.40 - 2916.40] P:1589.21 E:0.068063 |  possession and their movement
[2916.40 - 2918.40] P:1537.04 E:0.069902 |  and they've looked very, very comfortable on the ball.
[2918.40 - 2920.40] P:1338.32 E:0.066082 |  Fabio Capello will have concerns
[2920.40 - 2922.40] P:1373.63 E:0.064089 |  every time the home team have possession,
[2922.40 - 2924.40] P:1528.82 E:0.072452 |  every time they counterattack,
[2924.40 - 2926.40] P:1700.10 E:0.062585 |  they just wasted possession on that occasion
[2926.40 - 2928.40] P:1802.13 E:0.065053 |  and this would be a good time now for England to go in front.
[2928.40 - 2930.40] P:1725.07 E:0.070433 |  Gerard heads the ball forward
[2930.40 - 2932.40] P:1598.69 E:0.069785 |  and he's got a bang on the head as well.
[2932.40 - 2934.40] P:1579.39 E:0.059456 |  I think the defender is picking Gerard up.
[2934.40 - 2936.40] P:1681.41 E:0.064643 |  He's okay. Free kick has been given
[2936.40 - 2938.40] P:1688.63 E:0.065972 |  to England for the challenge on Stephen Gerard.
[2938.40 - 2940.40] P:1698.56 E:0.058672 |  So we have about 50 seconds of normal time to go,
[2940.40 - 2942.40] P:1687.39 E:0.066604 |  maybe a minute to be added on.
[2942.40 - 2944.40] P:1671.17 E:0.064490 |  England free kick taken short.
[2944.40 - 2946.40] P:1540.07 E:0.070864 |  It's Lampard at walking pace.
[2946.40 - 2948.40] P:1813.42 E:0.060814 |  Lampard forward to Heskey, typical Heskey control
[2948.40 - 2950.40] P:1700.77 E:0.064919 |  on the chest.
[2950.40 - 2952.40] P:1696.25 E:0.060748 |  Works his way towards the right.
[2952.40 - 2954.40] P:1792.50 E:0.068030 |  The ball bubbles back.
[2954.40 - 2956.40] P:1799.21 E:0.065879 |  Wolcott to Brown.
[2956.40 - 2958.40] P:1722.56 E:0.054807 |  England building slowly.
[2958.40 - 2960.40] P:1725.99 E:0.059321 |  Wes Brown now with a cross into the area.
[2960.40 - 2962.40] P:1750.77 E:0.061501 |  Doesn't reach Rooney.
[2962.40 - 2964.40] P:1849.52 E:0.080210 |  Heading away by the defender.
[2964.40 - 2966.40] P:1614.05 E:0.060687 |  Belarus now looking to get forward
[2966.40 - 2968.40] P:1631.32 E:0.073696 |  as quickly as they possibly can with Poteo.
[2968.40 - 2970.40] P:1768.59 E:0.069493 |  The man who's taken over from the injured
[2970.40 - 2972.40] P:1796.69 E:0.077358 |  Alexander Kleb in this Belarus side.
[2972.40 - 2974.40] P:1678.26 E:0.063587 |  But they haven't missed him greatly in this first half.
[2974.40 - 2976.40] P:1717.00 E:0.066142 |  His very young central threesome they have in midfield.
[2976.40 - 2978.40] P:1720.76 E:0.066019 |  He's very young central threesome they have in midfield.
[2978.40 - 2980.40] P:1786.69 E:0.064582 |  Central threesome they have in midfield.
[2980.40 - 2982.40] P:1721.46 E:0.064890 |  Doing well for the home side.
[2982.40 - 2984.40] P:1755.12 E:0.070765 |  Up against the experienced Lampard and Gerard and Barry.
[2984.40 - 2986.40] P:1673.17 E:0.036857 |  Now Barry slides the ball back into his own half.
[2986.40 - 2988.40] P:1587.00 E:0.067722 |  Upsome with a big up and under towards Rooney.
[2988.40 - 2990.40] P:1709.45 E:0.068964 |  Flag has gone up again.
[2990.40 - 2992.40] P:1719.80 E:0.066603 |  Might have been Heskey I think who's straight off side.
[2992.40 - 2994.40] P:1876.50 E:0.073704 |  We've got one minute of added time and the scoreline here is one all.
[2994.40 - 2996.40] P:1859.35 E:0.075023 |  I think that Capella will want to see this come out.
[2996.40 - 2998.40] P:1914.63 E:0.065159 |  Get into the team, into the second half.
[2998.40 - 3000.40] P:1830.80 E:0.068538 |  Explain very much what he wants,
[3000.40 - 3002.40] P:1842.14 E:0.073476 |  what he requires from it.
[3002.40 - 3004.40] P:1784.31 E:0.080453 |  He's going to be a good player.
[3004.40 - 3006.40] P:1192.39 E:0.072925 |  He's going to be a good player.
[3006.40 - 3008.40] P:1064.24 E:0.075368 |  He's going to be a good player.
[3008.40 - 3010.40] P:1356.93 E:0.068778 |  It seems that whenever they can try to get Walka to away,
[3010.40 - 3012.40] P:1401.83 E:0.072285 |  they're looking to do that.
[3012.40 - 3014.40] P:1412.32 E:0.070315 |  But sometimes you know you can just get a little bit
[3014.40 - 3016.40] P:1433.05 E:0.074284 |  one sided about that.
[3016.40 - 3018.40] P:1699.56 E:0.064219 |  Well he's certainly got at them at half time against Kazakhstan.
[3018.40 - 3020.40] P:1623.59 E:0.070947 |  Let's hope he has the same effect here tonight.
[3020.40 - 3022.40] P:1548.35 E:0.074756 |  In the meantime we're going back to the Northern Ireland game
[3022.40 - 3024.40] P:1628.92 E:0.071919 |  and Ian Dennis.
[3024.40 - 3026.40] P:1629.60 E:0.078027 |  And Northern Ireland have taken the lead on the half hour.
[3026.40 - 3028.40] P:1635.21 E:0.084284 |  David Healy scored 13 goals in qualifying for Euro 2008.
[3028.40 - 3030.40] P:1655.53 E:0.087072 |  And he's up and running here breaking the deadlock.
[3030.40 - 3032.40] P:1713.36 E:0.073972 |  One nil Northern Ireland.
[3032.40 - 3034.40] P:1556.97 E:0.080280 |  Thank you, remember.
[3034.40 - 3036.40] P:1607.85 E:0.070441 |  Republic of Ireland won Cyprus nil,
[3036.40 - 3038.40] P:1508.12 E:0.074057 |  Robbie Keane and it's still Germany nil,
[3038.40 - 3040.40] P:1604.20 E:0.073096 |  Wales nil.
[3040.40 - 3042.40] P:1767.44 E:0.074275 |  More on those games coming literally in a few seconds time
[3042.40 - 3044.40] P:1719.40 E:0.065001 |  because it's almost half time here in Minsk.
[3044.40 - 3046.40] P:1610.33 E:0.072065 |  It's been a very enjoyable first half.
[3046.40 - 3048.40] P:1646.30 E:0.065302 |  And there goes the whistle from the Norwegian referee.
[3048.40 - 3050.40] P:1768.89 E:0.076569 |  Plenty, plenty for England to think about here.
[3050.40 - 3052.40] P:1782.72 E:0.079655 |  They went in front through a dream of a goal
[3052.40 - 3054.40] P:1825.92 E:0.076836 |  from Steven Gerrard on his 70th appearance.
[3054.40 - 3056.40] P:1838.41 E:0.079895 |  But Belarus were always looking dangerous on the counterattack
[3056.40 - 3058.40] P:1748.20 E:0.072940 |  and they deservedly got back into it with a header from Sinko.
[3058.40 - 3060.40] P:1750.95 E:0.080552 |  So they got back into it with a header from Sinko.
[3060.40 - 3062.40] P:1760.66 E:0.076358 |  So they got back into it with a header from Sinko.
[3062.40 - 3064.40] P:1781.15 E:0.068461 |  So the half time score here with a fair amount for Fabio Capello to Ponda.
[3064.40 - 3066.40] P:1647.63 E:0.074499 |  Belarus won England one.
[3066.40 - 3068.40] P:1625.69 E:0.070611 |  Thank you Mike.
[3068.40 - 3070.40] P:1855.85 E:0.071274 |  Graham, what does Capello do?
[3070.40 - 3072.40] P:1736.60 E:0.071080 |  Well, I think first of all, he's got to make it quite clear
[3072.40 - 3074.40] P:1581.50 E:0.067456 |  that to lose possession against this side
[3074.40 - 3076.40] P:1530.87 E:0.067908 |  carelessly, they will break at you very quickly.
[3076.40 - 3078.40] P:1714.64 E:0.071191 |  The England players will know that by now.
[3078.40 - 3080.40] P:1485.95 E:0.068621 |  They will know that they're in a game.
[3080.40 - 3082.40] P:1541.83 E:0.073629 |  The other thing if you're talking about when it,
[3082.40 - 3084.40] P:1433.82 E:0.075986 |  yes, we can see we're trying to release Walcott
[3084.40 - 3086.40] P:1453.28 E:0.069006 |  on many occasions and there is absolutely nothing
[3086.40 - 3088.40] P:1629.21 E:0.070024 |  that we can do about it.
[3088.40 - 3090.40] P:1512.11 E:0.073619 |  We can see that they're in a game.
[3090.40 - 3092.40] P:1624.08 E:0.075523 |  We've seen that on many occasions and there is absolutely
[3092.40 - 3094.40] P:1218.51 E:0.065114 |  nothing wrong with that at all.
[3094.40 - 3096.40] P:1614.59 E:0.066069 |  But I know this sounds strange.
[3096.40 - 3098.40] P:1765.86 E:0.063453 |  Some old fashioned sometimes crossing with Heskey
[3098.40 - 3100.40] P:1218.65 E:0.071430 |  being dominated there.
[3100.40 - 3102.40] P:1321.91 E:0.065088 |  Getting the ball wide and getting the crosses is
[3102.40 - 3105.40] P:1710.26 E:0.063368 |  because I've seen it against both Croatia and Kazakhstan
[3105.40 - 3107.40] P:1723.80 E:0.070458 |  and I suspect this against Belarus.
[3107.40 - 3110.40] P:1546.80 E:0.063242 |  I don't think they're good at defending those kind of
[3110.40 - 3113.40] P:1594.77 E:0.061335 |  crosses and we've seen that on a couple of occasions
[3113.40 - 3116.40] P:1633.84 E:0.067751 |  when the ball has been crossed in to Heskey
[3116.40 - 3119.40] P:1573.28 E:0.074373 |  and the Belarusian defenders have been somewhat confused
[3119.40 - 3121.40] P:1663.55 E:0.077249 |  as to who should take responsibility.
[3121.40 - 3123.40] P:1536.95 E:0.084889 |  Great goal from Stephen Gerard.
[3123.40 - 3125.40] P:1825.25 E:0.077465 |  Slick move though from Belarus to the equaliser.
[3125.40 - 3127.40] P:1729.75 E:0.072727 |  Oh, definitely.
[3127.40 - 3129.40] P:1898.77 E:0.079659 |  First of all Gerard's goal as Alan Green said
[3129.40 - 3131.40] P:1899.47 E:0.071022 |  passed into the net from 31.
[3131.40 - 3133.40] P:1940.14 E:0.072987 |  Bent it round the keeper.
[3133.40 - 3136.40] P:1798.21 E:0.082324 |  Some very good ball control by Rooney early to that.
[3136.40 - 3138.40] P:1789.56 E:0.079341 |  But the Belarusian goal was excellent.
[3138.40 - 3141.40] P:1849.78 E:0.070669 |  You know there was some great combination play
[3141.40 - 3144.40] P:1871.49 E:0.066826 |  and some great play by Stozovic
[3144.40 - 3148.40] P:1838.67 E:0.068681 |  and he then bent it in to be headed in at the far post.
[3148.40 - 3150.40] P:1655.56 E:0.076271 |  It was a very very good team goal.
[3152.40 - 3154.40] P:1906.65 E:0.060232 |  Well, a little piece of information was given to me by
[3154.40 - 3156.40] P:1789.19 E:0.052048 |  Clive Tillsley.
[3156.40 - 3160.40] P:1875.07 E:0.058367 |  23 passes for that Belarus goal.
[3160.40 - 3162.40] P:1721.89 E:0.062065 |  23 passes, that is remarkable.
[3162.40 - 3165.40] P:1829.77 E:0.069183 |  And I've got to say even though I don't like anybody scoring
[3165.40 - 3167.40] P:1877.99 E:0.072356 |  against England, I applauded the goal.
[3167.40 - 3170.40] P:2063.39 E:0.071906 |  Actually what two great goals tonight.
[3170.40 - 3172.40] P:2008.95 E:0.072992 |  Very different goals.
[3172.40 - 3175.40] P:1986.01 E:0.067766 |  So England better stay awake at the start of the second half.
[3175.40 - 3177.40] P:1801.33 E:0.077460 |  I'll run down the teams and just to mark the fact
[3177.40 - 3180.40] P:1808.81 E:0.071478 |  I'll get the England team out of the way now because the referee is still getting instruction
[3180.40 - 3182.40] P:1895.48 E:0.062901 |  from television presumably.
[3182.40 - 3186.40] P:1799.26 E:0.064397 |  Goalkeeper James defender is Brian Fernand-Ubsen and Bridge.
[3186.40 - 3189.40] P:1633.93 E:0.067239 |  Midfielder, Walkott Lampard, Barry and Gerard.
[3189.40 - 3193.40] P:1784.43 E:0.059683 |  Then Rooney who I think has been outstanding and Heskut.
[3193.40 - 3196.40] P:1667.34 E:0.068942 |  The referee Terry Harger from Norway blows his whistle
[3196.40 - 3199.40] P:1644.43 E:0.067623 |  under way one one remember the start of the second half.
[3199.40 - 3201.40] P:1458.01 E:0.061404 |  That was a lunging challenge on Walkott
[3201.40 - 3203.40] P:1699.15 E:0.056099 |  and that's certainly a free kick against Belarus.
[3203.40 - 3205.40] P:1746.12 E:0.068969 |  Whose lineup is as follows.
[3205.40 - 3208.40] P:1690.80 E:0.049665 |  Goalkeeper Shevnoff defenders Amilyan Chuk,
[3208.40 - 3213.40] P:1762.46 E:0.048349 |  Filipenko for Kotsov and Moloch.
[3213.40 - 3216.40] P:1726.80 E:0.059407 |  Then Kulshi the captain is a holding midfielder player
[3216.40 - 3220.40] P:1697.98 E:0.061771 |  ahead of him, Cecevich Petiyo who picked up a yellow card
[3220.40 - 3224.40] P:1615.78 E:0.069788 |  like David James in the first half and Sitko the goal scorer.
[3224.40 - 3229.40] P:1618.45 E:0.053601 |  Then Kudasov very clever player and finally Bulliga.
[3229.40 - 3231.40] P:1564.00 E:0.053655 |  But I say very clever player.
[3231.40 - 3235.40] P:1578.90 E:0.057665 |  Graeme there multiple clever players in that Belarus side.
[3235.40 - 3237.40] P:1480.76 E:0.067195 |  I think they've been very impressive in the first half
[3237.40 - 3241.40] P:1730.20 E:0.056759 |  and it's come back from the goal down was very good.
[3241.40 - 3243.40] P:1716.97 E:0.065759 |  As I say no heads went down at all
[3243.40 - 3245.40] P:1590.24 E:0.062283 |  but a combination plays very good.
[3245.40 - 3246.40] P:1511.63 E:0.090701 |  Well done Walkott.
[3246.40 - 3248.40] P:1703.98 E:0.076782 |  Well just as I say well done Walkott.
[3248.40 - 3251.40] P:1829.72 E:0.064813 |  He got past two defenders then he missed control of all
[3251.40 - 3253.40] P:1700.98 E:0.057866 |  and squirts behind for a goal kick.
[3253.40 - 3256.40] P:1743.44 E:0.056428 |  Just a little bit too quick for himself there I think.
[3256.40 - 3258.40] P:1383.99 E:0.070880 |  I think that sometimes when you are very very quick
[3258.40 - 3261.40] P:1810.95 E:0.046831 |  you sometimes need to mentally slow down.
[3261.40 - 3264.40] P:1673.50 E:0.079186 |  I think that's something that you know he will learn
[3264.40 - 3269.40] P:1729.59 E:0.051464 |  as he gets older in terms of mentally just slowing himself down.
[3269.40 - 3274.40] P:1768.85 E:0.059907 |  Here's Moloch the left back and it goes to Petiyo flick down
[3274.40 - 3277.40] P:1798.23 E:0.063448 |  but only to those in white England white shirts
[3277.40 - 3280.40] P:1881.32 E:0.061807 |  Navy shorts white socks Belarus red shirts
[3280.40 - 3282.40] P:1606.33 E:0.069274 |  otherwise adorned in green.
[3282.40 - 3286.40] P:1787.45 E:0.056881 |  Here's Ubson to the far side and bridge
[3286.40 - 3288.40] P:1647.97 E:0.068294 |  not a great ball forward by bridge
[3288.40 - 3290.40] P:1661.24 E:0.056995 |  clattered back by on the young truck
[3290.40 - 3292.40] P:1693.45 E:0.063014 |  towards the England penalty area
[3292.40 - 3294.40] P:1761.87 E:0.063962 |  and Ubson just hooks it out of play.
[3294.40 - 3297.40] P:1684.01 E:0.072900 |  Do you think we look a little bit vulnerable at full back?
[3297.40 - 3300.40] P:1891.18 E:0.065821 |  Well I have to say this in defence of bridge a little bit
[3300.40 - 3302.40] P:1959.38 E:0.059020 |  and the case was there Stephen Jarrod with him
[3302.40 - 3305.40] P:1581.00 E:0.077466 |  not staying wide on the left and wondering
[3305.40 - 3309.40] P:1786.79 E:0.060273 |  when bridge gets the ball he has no option of passing the ball wide
[3309.40 - 3311.40] P:1740.04 E:0.068369 |  so he's either got an inside pass if it's not
[3311.40 - 3315.40] P:1684.46 E:0.055014 |  if it's not there he's only got a forward pass.
[3315.40 - 3317.40] P:1757.52 E:0.072386 |  Jarrod trying to win the ball back
[3317.40 - 3320.40] P:1863.47 E:0.066412 |  Hessey put a foot in his whirl and he contacted the player
[3320.40 - 3323.40] P:1894.77 E:0.067519 |  so it's a free kick awarded by the Norwegian referee
[3323.40 - 3325.40] P:1782.55 E:0.072435 |  to Belarus. Two minutes gone in the second half
[3325.40 - 3328.40] P:1743.00 E:0.055985 |  this is five live football on the BBC
[3328.40 - 3331.40] P:1756.28 E:0.067382 |  Belarus won England won and Belarus
[3331.40 - 3333.40] P:1624.10 E:0.058269 |  thoroughly deserved equalised.
[3333.40 - 3337.40] P:1659.03 E:0.063287 |  They responded so well to that marvellous goal scored by Jarrod
[3337.40 - 3340.40] P:1583.30 E:0.061940 |  they responded with an equally marvellous goal
[3340.40 - 3344.40] P:1702.22 E:0.046422 |  23 passes before Sit goes header
[3345.40 - 3348.40] P:1905.73 E:0.060729 |  Hessey was being pulled back
[3348.40 - 3350.40] P:1839.27 E:0.076054 |  England still have the ball
[3350.40 - 3352.40] P:1917.90 E:0.071811 |  lovely pass by Lampard on the runy
[3352.40 - 3354.40] P:1957.93 E:0.078999 |  runy with Jarrod ahead of him
[3354.40 - 3356.40] P:1889.12 E:0.076099 |  runy still going great move by runy
[3356.40 - 3358.40] P:1894.23 E:0.075784 |  the shot was limp and it's easily saved
[3358.40 - 3360.40] P:1974.26 E:0.073217 |  he just couldn't get the ball from out of his feet
[3360.40 - 3362.40] P:2003.41 E:0.071208 |  the tremendous run like UL
[3362.40 - 3365.40] P:2003.89 E:0.072633 |  and I think he's looked very lively runy tonight
[3365.40 - 3368.40] P:2027.59 E:0.078956 |  even though Jarrod goes excessively
[3368.40 - 3371.40] P:2059.87 E:0.067483 |  his control was excellent
[3371.40 - 3374.40] P:1984.36 E:0.084812 |  just reminding Northern Ireland to San Marino NIL
[3374.40 - 3376.40] P:1968.53 E:0.067911 |  that's at Windsor Park
[3376.40 - 3378.40] P:1950.59 E:0.072457 |  Wales drawing NIL NIL in Germany
[3378.40 - 3380.40] P:1816.55 E:0.070619 |  but the Republic of Ireland won up against Cyprus
[3380.40 - 3383.40] P:1879.80 E:0.071600 |  and when last I heard it was gracious to Andorra NIL
[3383.40 - 3387.40] P:1900.27 E:0.055349 |  now one of the creation players is down injured
[3387.40 - 3390.40] P:1781.83 E:0.060180 |  that's why the goalkeeper wallied the ball out of play
[3390.40 - 3392.40] P:1781.07 E:0.050863 |  so he can receive attention
[3392.40 - 3394.40] P:1642.13 E:0.036060 |  is that Kudasov?
[3394.40 - 3396.40] P:1705.54 E:0.051642 |  no it's Poteo
[3396.40 - 3398.40] P:1687.23 E:0.047312 |  he's limping away
[3398.40 - 3400.40] P:1800.12 E:0.048039 |  haven't they been impressive
[3400.40 - 3403.40] P:1784.34 E:0.068004 |  I think the thing is that the short passing game
[3403.40 - 3405.40] P:1694.96 E:0.065027 |  and the way they move it you can understand why
[3405.40 - 3408.40] P:1587.67 E:0.066198 |  Capello said earlier they play like Arsenal
[3408.40 - 3410.40] P:1615.89 E:0.066779 |  short passing and movement
[3410.40 - 3412.40] P:1612.40 E:0.064952 |  lots of little clubs out there
[3412.40 - 3414.40] P:1553.54 E:0.074533 |  except for the Bain ones
[3414.40 - 3416.40] P:1504.71 E:0.065343 |  little legs there
[3416.40 - 3418.40] P:1618.23 E:0.074589 |  they're terrific
[3418.40 - 3420.40] P:1707.27 E:0.066614 |  really impressed with Belarus
[3420.40 - 3422.40] P:1765.52 E:0.069385 |  I'm at the city of Minsk
[3422.40 - 3424.40] P:1710.18 E:0.067616 |  I got in this morning
[3424.40 - 3426.40] P:1686.92 E:0.066838 |  and the driver from the airport
[3426.40 - 3428.40] P:1728.59 E:0.066400 |  what a beautiful looking city
[3428.40 - 3430.40] P:1797.11 E:0.067104 |  it's very very nice
[3430.40 - 3432.40] P:1788.59 E:0.066936 |  no play resumes
[3432.40 - 3434.40] P:1786.80 E:0.070718 |  the ball played down the England left flank
[3434.40 - 3436.40] P:1825.21 E:0.059585 |  and then it's cleared
[3436.40 - 3438.40] P:1719.34 E:0.061049 |  securely by Upson
[3438.40 - 3440.40] P:1708.60 E:0.056305 |  but the flag is up for offside
[3440.40 - 3442.40] P:1622.66 E:0.031115 |  against Emil Heskey
[3442.40 - 3444.40] P:1509.40 E:0.078575 |  Runeon Heskey working very hard
[3444.40 - 3446.40] P:1595.69 E:0.047686 |  you would expect that from them
[3446.40 - 3448.40] P:1520.87 E:0.046399 |  yes
[3448.40 - 3450.40] P:1616.94 E:0.068027 |  but if you look just as it now
[3450.40 - 3452.40] P:1838.27 E:0.064563 |  you see where Gerard is
[3452.40 - 3454.40] P:1650.27 E:0.075575 |  he's very central on Heskey as well
[3454.40 - 3456.40] P:1769.73 E:0.070825 |  so there's no doubt about it
[3456.40 - 3458.40] P:1753.75 E:0.072342 |  which makes it especially difficult for Wayne Bridge
[3458.40 - 3460.40] P:1741.38 E:0.044218 |  anyway the free kick
[3460.40 - 3462.40] P:1746.68 E:0.051661 |  is taken by Frikotsov
[3462.40 - 3464.40] P:1586.49 E:0.062967 |  not too well taken
[3464.40 - 3466.40] P:1627.33 E:0.067458 |  Brian heads it away
[3466.40 - 3468.40] P:1652.46 E:0.061780 |  Upson heads it further away
[3468.40 - 3470.40] P:1699.86 E:0.058704 |  but Belarus have it back
[3470.40 - 3472.40] P:1613.47 E:0.066477 |  they're right full back
[3472.40 - 3474.40] P:1623.42 E:0.063969 |  he's tackled ball breaks out of play
[3474.40 - 3476.40] P:1654.24 E:0.066965 |  it must hit him last because it's an England throw
[3476.40 - 3478.40] P:1696.92 E:0.067519 |  right in front of the England fans
[3478.40 - 3480.40] P:1802.50 E:0.069824 |  the far side of the pitch
[3480.40 - 3482.40] P:1811.50 E:0.068839 |  thrown quickly to Heskey
[3482.40 - 3484.40] P:1879.53 E:0.064538 |  good run by Runeon as well
[3484.40 - 3486.40] P:1755.09 E:0.080688 |  into the penalty area
[3486.40 - 3488.40] P:1789.00 E:0.077013 |  into Rune, great goal
[3488.40 - 3490.40] P:1747.35 E:0.072974 |  brilliantly set up by Emil Heskey
[3490.40 - 3492.40] P:1680.60 E:0.073620 |  and finished off by England's best players
[3492.40 - 3494.40] P:1673.59 E:0.074913 |  so far in the night
[3494.40 - 3496.40] P:1703.32 E:0.076657 |  Wayne Runeon and England are 2-1 in front
[3496.40 - 3498.40] P:1690.67 E:0.065403 |  5 minutes into the second half
[3498.40 - 3500.40] P:1579.92 E:0.077285 |  some great play by Emil Heskey there
[3500.40 - 3502.40] P:1731.35 E:0.066847 |  he's got the ball wide on the left
[3502.40 - 3504.40] P:1769.95 E:0.066779 |  he's held players off
[3504.40 - 3506.40] P:1744.37 E:0.076888 |  he's beaten players all the time
[3506.40 - 3508.40] P:1526.92 E:0.083069 |  you could see Runeon in the middle unmarked
[3508.40 - 3510.40] P:1609.16 E:0.057996 |  and this is why I was saying early
[3510.40 - 3512.40] P:1598.05 E:0.073778 |  not one Belarus defender went to mark him
[3512.40 - 3514.40] P:1742.21 E:0.071472 |  cross came in by Heskey
[3514.40 - 3516.40] P:1625.96 E:0.073782 |  Runeon put it away so comfortably
[3516.40 - 3518.40] P:1739.83 E:0.064962 |  what I noticed
[3518.40 - 3520.40] P:1418.83 E:0.072459 |  they'll be very disappointed with their defending there
[3520.40 - 3522.40] P:1672.80 E:0.068436 |  but it puts England 2-1 in front
[3522.40 - 3524.40] P:1590.84 E:0.065604 |  well done Emil Heskey
[3524.40 - 3526.40] P:1443.90 E:0.072726 |  really and well done
[3526.40 - 3528.40] P:1545.83 E:0.083028 |  Wayne Runeon he's been making runs like
[3528.40 - 3530.40] P:1488.25 E:0.066970 |  that all night
[3530.40 - 3532.40] P:1633.48 E:0.068744 |  Wacott didn't pick him up
[3532.40 - 3534.40] P:1641.12 E:0.074846 |  once Lampard tried to find Wacott
[3534.40 - 3536.40] P:1682.03 E:0.069292 |  when he could have found Runeon
[3536.40 - 3538.40] P:1424.04 E:0.073352 |  and I'm glad he's got the goal
[3538.40 - 3540.40] P:1653.90 E:0.066600 |  I mean the combination of Heskey and Runeon
[3540.40 - 3542.40] P:1507.15 E:0.061096 |  it's very very threatening
[3542.40 - 3544.40] P:1514.06 E:0.063799 |  and we saw the result of it there today
[3544.40 - 3546.40] P:1144.25 E:0.062160 |  I think from Belarus' point of view
[3546.40 - 3548.40] P:1198.41 E:0.067280 |  they'd be very disappointed with their defending
[3548.40 - 3550.40] P:1324.67 E:0.062852 |  but I think of everything that is their weak point
[3550.40 - 3552.40] P:1485.13 E:0.033830 |  and it has to be said
[3552.40 - 3554.40] P:1684.82 E:0.069788 |  looking at how well
[3554.40 - 3556.40] P:1705.43 E:0.065524 |  Runeon Heskey play together
[3556.40 - 3558.40] P:1441.46 E:0.061224 |  even though I personally feel that Michael
[3558.40 - 3560.40] P:1639.54 E:0.060266 |  should be in the squad
[3560.40 - 3562.40] P:1609.70 E:0.071851 |  there's no way he could be in the team ahead of those two
[3562.40 - 3564.40] P:1436.03 E:0.062228 |  not the way they're playing at present time for England
[3564.40 - 3566.40] P:1594.45 E:0.072037 |  so England have regained the league
[3566.40 - 3568.40] P:1615.80 E:0.055584 |  now how will Belarus
[3568.40 - 3570.40] P:1676.06 E:0.064104 |  respond they responded
[3570.40 - 3572.40] P:1572.07 E:0.046788 |  terrifically
[3572.40 - 3574.40] P:1320.05 E:0.077311 |  going one nil down how will they feel about
[3574.40 - 3576.40] P:1634.44 E:0.066793 |  losing a goal so early in the second half
[3576.40 - 3578.40] P:1513.91 E:0.056960 |  and again it just quattens the crowd a bit
[3578.40 - 3580.40] P:1246.01 E:0.059257 |  apart from that infernal
[3580.40 - 3582.40] P:1422.52 E:0.064662 |  or maybe that's the Sheffield band in the far side of the field
[3582.40 - 3584.40] P:1516.61 E:0.043690 |  don't know
[3584.40 - 3586.40] P:1725.85 E:0.074660 |  England fans are cheering and dancing
[3586.40 - 3588.40] P:1889.04 E:0.054575 |  England lead Belarus
[3588.40 - 3590.40] P:2004.30 E:0.073398 |  by two goals to one
[3590.40 - 3592.40] P:1959.71 E:0.073688 |  and we're in the 52nd minute of the game
[3592.40 - 3594.40] P:2047.76 E:0.072435 |  David James slips as he
[3594.40 - 3596.40] P:1837.13 E:0.069625 |  finally cleared the ball
[3596.40 - 3598.40] P:1945.16 E:0.065086 |  Heskey takes it well on his chest
[3598.40 - 3600.40] P:1896.38 E:0.053074 |  plays it back to bridge
[3600.40 - 3602.40] P:1863.58 E:0.067965 |  bridge moves away
[3602.40 - 3604.40] P:1823.63 E:0.067126 |  and then crosses low
[3604.40 - 3606.40] P:1619.69 E:0.080665 |  and towards Runeon
[3606.40 - 3608.40] P:1730.34 E:0.067636 |  tried to feed it back to Stephen Gerard
[3608.40 - 3610.40] P:1538.79 E:0.057591 |  didn't get the pass quite right
[3610.40 - 3612.40] P:1453.09 E:0.069229 |  and it should be cleared by Belarus
[3612.40 - 3614.40] P:1384.85 E:0.064037 |  but it was wonderful again from Wayne Runeon
[3614.40 - 3616.40] P:1415.10 E:0.052447 |  very unlucky there
[3616.40 - 3618.40] P:1463.61 E:0.070103 |  his first touch to bring the ball down out of the air
[3618.40 - 3620.40] P:1528.98 E:0.057711 |  and then turn as he came round
[3620.40 - 3622.40] P:1669.76 E:0.065801 |  wasn't able just to get the
[3622.40 - 3624.40] P:1567.09 E:0.061893 |  strength on the ball
[3624.40 - 3626.40] P:1543.24 E:0.061179 |  and he would have set Stephen Gerard up
[3626.40 - 3628.40] P:1748.74 E:0.060908 |  for an opportunity to score England's third
[3628.40 - 3630.40] P:1537.55 E:0.052857 |  well
[3630.40 - 3632.40] P:1764.23 E:0.070960 |  Runeon earlier in the season
[3632.40 - 3634.40] P:1793.86 E:0.065363 |  was a pale shadow of the man he's been in
[3634.40 - 3636.40] P:1705.03 E:0.063677 |  in recent games
[3636.40 - 3638.40] P:1653.71 E:0.057240 |  from Manchester United and for England
[3638.40 - 3640.40] P:1613.78 E:0.061757 |  he's absolutely bang on form
[3640.40 - 3642.40] P:1662.14 E:0.051683 |  here's Lampard
[3642.40 - 3644.40] P:1667.35 E:0.071756 |  England's search for a third goal
[3644.40 - 3646.40] P:1722.96 E:0.050664 |  that truly would kill off Belarus
[3646.40 - 3648.40] P:1719.88 E:0.063347 |  play to the left side
[3648.40 - 3650.40] P:1625.46 E:0.060561 |  and Heskey back to Gerard
[3650.40 - 3652.40] P:1684.30 E:0.070020 |  and Gerard spots Brown down the right flank
[3652.40 - 3654.40] P:1627.35 E:0.057939 |  and Mark plays it
[3654.40 - 3656.40] P:1502.69 E:0.051711 |  two ways Brown
[3656.40 - 3658.40] P:1532.35 E:0.054113 |  Barry's available
[3658.40 - 3660.40] P:1451.25 E:0.063052 |  but Brown plays it back to Ferdinand
[3660.40 - 3662.40] P:1592.44 E:0.061923 |  and on to Lampard
[3662.40 - 3664.40] P:1717.81 E:0.079600 |  and suddenly England looking command of the game
[3664.40 - 3666.40] P:1554.65 E:0.061916 |  they do and you can only say straight after half time
[3666.40 - 3668.40] P:1638.19 E:0.064283 |  then Capello the manager has to be given some credit
[3668.40 - 3670.40] P:1939.77 E:0.068717 |  because he's obviously said something
[3670.40 - 3672.40] P:1926.49 E:0.067977 |  and adjusted something
[3672.40 - 3674.40] P:1890.37 E:0.061770 |  and put things into the players minds
[3674.40 - 3676.40] P:1766.98 E:0.061433 |  and they've come out and they've looked very purposeful
[3676.40 - 3678.40] P:1796.75 E:0.048807 |  since the kickoff of the second half
[3678.40 - 3680.40] P:1602.96 E:0.064037 |  I love managers who make things happen
[3680.40 - 3682.40] P:1615.72 E:0.053595 |  you know, good point in waiting to 75 minutes
[3682.40 - 3684.40] P:1714.18 E:0.063537 |  you see something wrong at half time
[3684.40 - 3686.40] P:1663.07 E:0.065468 |  get it right
[3686.40 - 3688.40] P:1659.15 E:0.038498 |  free kick for a foul on Heskey
[3688.40 - 3690.40] P:1696.76 E:0.051359 |  it's a couple of feet in from the left touch line
[3690.40 - 3692.40] P:1594.34 E:0.063961 |  Gerard's going to take it
[3692.40 - 3694.40] P:1751.22 E:0.053289 |  Ferdinand Upsen inside the penalty
[3694.40 - 3696.40] P:1681.63 E:0.065697 |  played deep looking for Upsen
[3696.40 - 3698.40] P:1623.99 E:0.074111 |  who heads it on just ahead
[3698.40 - 3700.40] P:1401.05 E:0.056255 |  of Amiel Heskey
[3700.40 - 3702.40] P:1665.24 E:0.066024 |  and the goalkeeper Shevno has it
[3702.40 - 3704.40] P:1663.34 E:0.063366 |  and he throws it out straight out of play
[3704.40 - 3706.40] P:1577.95 E:0.048945 |  and he apologizes
[3706.40 - 3708.40] P:1536.94 E:0.052683 |  to Kudizov
[3708.40 - 3710.40] P:1422.74 E:0.060760 |  who was the target
[3710.40 - 3712.40] P:1483.37 E:0.060885 |  England throwing on the half way line
[3712.40 - 3714.40] P:1524.86 E:0.063887 |  Brent Stanger patrolling that technical area
[3714.40 - 3716.40] P:1397.79 E:0.045617 |  Greyhurd man
[3716.40 - 3718.40] P:1464.43 E:0.042324 |  and vast experience
[3718.40 - 3720.40] P:1757.40 E:0.052966 |  and some but brilliant
[3720.40 - 3722.40] P:1466.77 E:0.059333 |  I was talking about the great work he did
[3722.40 - 3724.40] P:1445.80 E:0.056915 |  in a racky football
[3724.40 - 3726.40] P:1604.00 E:0.068236 |  and he's obviously producing a very good Belarus team
[3726.40 - 3728.40] P:1640.69 E:0.065036 |  they may now struggle
[3728.40 - 3730.40] P:1685.52 E:0.055265 |  to claw another goal back against England
[3730.40 - 3732.40] P:1591.07 E:0.055378 |  yes, I mean they've got to sort of react
[3732.40 - 3734.40] P:1685.64 E:0.067982 |  as they did when they went to
[3734.40 - 3736.40] P:1682.56 E:0.065867 |  one goal down in the first half
[3736.40 - 3738.40] P:1430.97 E:0.065305 |  and they came back at England
[3738.40 - 3740.40] P:1642.74 E:0.064806 |  but once again we've seen otherwise
[3740.40 - 3742.40] P:1389.58 E:0.062547 |  that sometimes the tiredness creeps in
[3742.40 - 3744.40] P:1619.06 E:0.059219 |  probably the fitness
[3744.40 - 3746.40] P:1613.89 E:0.060266 |  and the physical condition of the England players
[3746.40 - 3748.40] P:1531.87 E:0.073364 |  could be their advantage
[3748.40 - 3750.40] P:1699.80 E:0.071533 |  there was a poor ball by Barry there
[3750.40 - 3752.40] P:1683.52 E:0.046024 |  and then I think
[3752.40 - 3754.40] P:1741.23 E:0.074414 |  Sipco the Belarusian goal
[3754.40 - 3756.40] P:1655.01 E:0.049946 |  score was filed
[3756.40 - 3758.40] P:1302.92 E:0.075964 |  but the referee allowed play to continue
[3758.40 - 3760.40] P:1602.21 E:0.073737 |  Belarus still have the ball
[3760.40 - 3762.40] P:1703.18 E:0.047056 |  it would be interesting to see if he takes any action
[3762.40 - 3764.40] P:1704.31 E:0.064744 |  it's head out of play
[3764.40 - 3766.40] P:1794.56 E:0.054616 |  and then his colleague
[3766.40 - 3768.40] P:1821.29 E:0.065405 |  hadn't realised he got to his feet
[3768.40 - 3770.40] P:1711.98 E:0.071485 |  he put the ball out of play so Sipco lay down again
[3770.40 - 3772.40] P:1457.45 E:0.061812 |  or he sat down again
[3772.40 - 3774.40] P:1468.42 E:0.055888 |  captain Colty looked round
[3774.40 - 3776.40] P:1610.83 E:0.065660 |  I think it was a collision with Rooney
[3776.40 - 3778.40] P:1663.42 E:0.060112 |  and Rooney goes and shakes his hand
[3778.40 - 3780.40] P:1795.13 E:0.061680 |  just to make sure the referee doesn't think
[3780.40 - 3782.40] P:1650.41 E:0.055266 |  of doing anything else
[3782.40 - 3784.40] P:1876.24 E:0.060049 |  anyway
[3784.40 - 3786.40] P:1836.47 E:0.071298 |  we'd all rather see a Wayne Rooney like that wouldn't we
[3786.40 - 3788.40] P:1928.79 E:0.066494 |  in all honesty
[3788.40 - 3790.40] P:1766.25 E:0.077676 |  he bit once or twice at the referee early on
[3790.40 - 3792.40] P:1902.83 E:0.059752 |  but since then he hasn't done
[3792.40 - 3794.40] P:1882.31 E:0.062482 |  I know people say it's fiery
[3794.40 - 3796.40] P:1857.20 E:0.057892 |  it's in his temperament but the more he can stay
[3796.40 - 3798.40] P:1516.91 E:0.062130 |  often away from referees I think that helps his game
[3798.40 - 3800.40] P:1691.82 E:0.064034 |  but he's got a great
[3800.40 - 3802.40] P:1796.68 E:0.048320 |  football brain
[3802.40 - 3804.40] P:1767.03 E:0.065767 |  Wayne Rooney and he won't feel frustration tonight
[3804.40 - 3806.40] P:1729.33 E:0.067945 |  he must know how well he's playing
[3806.40 - 3808.40] P:1654.23 E:0.056514 |  and the score as well terrific
[3808.40 - 3810.40] P:1601.15 E:0.052935 |  throw into Belarus on the far side of the field
[3810.40 - 3812.40] P:1549.63 E:0.045034 |  throw
[3812.40 - 3814.40] P:1563.29 E:0.048548 |  to
[3814.40 - 3816.40] P:1483.45 E:0.056875 |  Buliga and now it's back on the half way line
[3816.40 - 3818.40] P:1501.80 E:0.051596 |  on the Yanchuk
[3818.40 - 3820.40] P:1768.85 E:0.056007 |  exchanges passes with the colleague
[3820.40 - 3822.40] P:1620.15 E:0.070117 |  and then he gives the ball away
[3822.40 - 3824.40] P:1422.77 E:0.062970 |  wall caught then round forward
[3824.40 - 3826.40] P:1612.05 E:0.056486 |  there must be a sneaky little handball there
[3826.40 - 3828.40] P:1732.22 E:0.050785 |  by Kudasov gets away with it
[3828.40 - 3830.40] P:1362.03 E:0.074398 |  that might have been a yellow card
[3830.40 - 3832.40] P:1635.58 E:0.050608 |  anywhere to free kick to wienland
[3832.40 - 3834.40] P:1734.22 E:0.044037 |  played quickly, Brian back to Ferdinand
[3834.40 - 3836.40] P:1808.46 E:0.041039 |  and on to Upson
[3836.40 - 3838.40] P:1706.09 E:0.050359 |  Upson hits it to the left flank
[3838.40 - 3840.40] P:1881.89 E:0.073468 |  towards bridge
[3840.40 - 3842.40] P:1832.35 E:0.048551 |  Rooney's down that flank, Gerard's in a central position
[3842.40 - 3844.40] P:1688.71 E:0.054521 |  it's as if Rooney and Gerard are switching
[3844.40 - 3846.40] P:1668.87 E:0.044692 |  what I have to say though
[3846.40 - 3848.40] P:1450.08 E:0.069736 |  there's a prime example there
[3848.40 - 3850.40] P:1166.11 E:0.070205 |  when Wayne Bridge got the ball
[3850.40 - 3852.40] P:1513.37 E:0.055681 |  he only had one option
[3852.40 - 3854.40] P:1450.20 E:0.068953 |  and that was to find Rooney up front
[3854.40 - 3856.40] P:1442.13 E:0.062613 |  there was no other option for him at all
[3856.40 - 3858.40] P:1553.36 E:0.057823 |  I feel a bit of sympathy for him Alan sometimes
[3858.40 - 3860.40] P:1666.52 E:0.062954 |  when he gets the ball there
[3860.40 - 3862.40] P:1420.23 E:0.059089 |  sorry Graeme, Lampard just headed the ball in the direction of wall caught
[3862.40 - 3864.40] P:1433.20 E:0.068290 |  but ahead of the Arsenal play
[3864.40 - 3866.40] P:1412.23 E:0.066289 |  so it's out for a throw in to Belarus
[3866.40 - 3868.40] P:1434.13 E:0.056255 |  I've really enjoyed the game you know
[3868.40 - 3870.40] P:1328.23 E:0.032234 |  it's been a good game
[3870.40 - 3872.40] P:1427.92 E:0.058236 |  you know
[3872.40 - 3874.40] P:1590.63 E:0.069894 |  and the argument these days that there are no minu's
[3874.40 - 3876.40] P:1518.07 E:0.056861 |  well there are one or two we know
[3876.40 - 3878.40] P:1785.92 E:0.058401 |  but Belarus just emphasising
[3878.40 - 3880.40] P:1677.26 E:0.048593 |  that a so-called
[3880.40 - 3882.40] P:1643.06 E:0.060587 |  small nation
[3882.40 - 3884.40] P:1605.98 E:0.069489 |  can produce a really good football team
[3884.40 - 3886.40] P:1565.42 E:0.039792 |  and this is a difficult game for England tonight
[3886.40 - 3888.40] P:1578.81 E:0.046791 |  no, it's with the full back
[3888.40 - 3890.40] P:1641.43 E:0.065728 |  Molloch the left full back
[3890.40 - 3892.40] P:1846.90 E:0.063149 |  he plays it forward then there's a foul by Brian
[3892.40 - 3894.40] P:1967.18 E:0.062138 |  and that's going to be a free kick
[3894.40 - 3896.40] P:1968.61 E:0.062984 |  to Belarus and some whistles from the crowd
[3898.40 - 3900.40] P:1877.71 E:0.066643 |  brilliantly bright floodlights
[3900.40 - 3902.40] P:1785.99 E:0.067750 |  huge towers of floodlights
[3902.40 - 3904.40] P:1672.44 E:0.053479 |  enlighten the stadium
[3904.40 - 3906.40] P:1689.12 E:0.053759 |  otherwise it's pitch black
[3906.40 - 3908.40] P:1441.79 E:0.041932 |  and you do get the feeling
[3908.40 - 3910.40] P:1795.71 E:0.071151 |  such as the chill in the air
[3910.40 - 3912.40] P:1304.94 E:0.059948 |  there's another one or two down the line
[3912.40 - 3914.40] P:1615.78 E:0.061193 |  and it'll be a nippy place to spend an evening
[3914.40 - 3916.40] P:1601.94 E:0.062220 |  I'm not so certain it'll be the place to come then
[3916.40 - 3918.40] P:1795.47 E:0.049436 |  just looking at this I've just got the feeling
[3918.40 - 3920.40] P:1455.51 E:0.059211 |  you know that physically when I spoke about fitness wise as well
[3920.40 - 3922.40] P:1571.81 E:0.046606 |  I just think that England
[3922.40 - 3924.40] P:1597.84 E:0.055523 |  will have more than an edge here
[3924.40 - 3926.40] P:1665.36 E:0.056073 |  as this game progresses
[3926.40 - 3928.40] P:1722.74 E:0.071335 |  Rooney leaves the ball for Gerard
[3928.40 - 3930.40] P:1745.87 E:0.066546 |  back to Lampard, Lampard switches it towards the left flank
[3930.40 - 3932.40] P:1768.17 E:0.064252 |  bridge is down there
[3932.40 - 3934.40] P:1648.05 E:0.054356 |  the defender should have cut it out
[3934.40 - 3936.40] P:1644.46 E:0.038946 |  didn't bridge back to Barry
[3936.40 - 3938.40] P:1723.16 E:0.057380 |  Barry on to Heskey
[3938.40 - 3940.40] P:1576.36 E:0.060620 |  falls over
[3940.40 - 3942.40] P:1718.31 E:0.058499 |  wasn't followed on that occasion
[3942.40 - 3944.40] P:1721.63 E:0.046221 |  and now it's taken forward
[3944.40 - 3946.40] P:1648.30 E:0.056518 |  by Patio
[3946.40 - 3948.40] P:1785.36 E:0.071709 |  into the captain Kulchi in the centre circle
[3948.40 - 3950.40] P:1773.34 E:0.072870 |  and played down the left flank towards Sitko
[3950.40 - 3952.40] P:1757.69 E:0.061628 |  who headed them level
[3952.40 - 3954.40] P:1373.58 E:0.061054 |  at 11
[3954.40 - 3956.40] P:1712.96 E:0.048990 |  he tried to find Vulligard
[3956.40 - 3958.40] P:1356.61 E:0.068122 |  didn't, Vulligard running in field
[3958.40 - 3960.40] P:1419.54 E:0.055366 |  not down the edge of the penalty area
[3960.40 - 3962.40] P:1475.83 E:0.059144 |  he made harmlessly for a goal kick
[3962.40 - 3964.40] P:1578.17 E:0.066303 |  miss understanding there
[3964.40 - 3966.40] P:1548.89 E:0.052988 |  thought the run was going to be made
[3966.40 - 3968.40] P:1667.62 E:0.061043 |  it wasn't but the pass had already gone
[3968.40 - 3970.40] P:1703.35 E:0.064049 |  but it was the first little indication
[3970.40 - 3972.40] P:1864.84 E:0.056415 |  of them getting a passing movement together
[3972.40 - 3974.40] P:1816.41 E:0.060081 |  Kulchi in this holding midfielder
[3974.40 - 3976.40] P:1716.44 E:0.057052 |  has had a lot of the ball the captain
[3976.40 - 3978.40] P:1393.81 E:0.066884 |  basically it's had no one to mark
[3978.40 - 3980.40] P:1526.99 E:0.061882 |  and so whenever he's had possession of the ball
[3980.40 - 3982.40] P:1676.04 E:0.053377 |  he's been able to start some good movements
[3982.40 - 3984.40] P:1568.15 E:0.059673 |  for Belarus
[3984.40 - 3986.40] P:1626.33 E:0.055194 |  a number of potential England substitutes warming up
[3986.40 - 3988.40] P:1494.97 E:0.071179 |  Pierre Crouch, David Beckerman won
[3988.40 - 3990.40] P:1708.45 E:0.056809 |  according to the official sheet
[3990.40 - 3992.40] P:1496.21 E:0.047785 |  Germain Defoe
[3992.40 - 3994.40] P:1406.70 E:0.055770 |  they left off the E
[3994.40 - 3996.40] P:1363.41 E:0.056516 |  Germain Defoe look at that
[3996.40 - 3998.40] P:1637.95 E:0.047094 |  I'm not going to try the Cyrillic version
[3998.40 - 4000.40] P:1801.65 E:0.041256 |  here's Rooney
[4000.40 - 4002.40] P:1715.19 E:0.065342 |  score of England's second goal
[4002.40 - 4004.40] P:1572.49 E:0.072945 |  to Lampard it wasn't a great lay off
[4004.40 - 4006.40] P:1718.07 E:0.079446 |  by Lampard towards Rooney again
[4006.40 - 4008.40] P:1741.29 E:0.066803 |  Belarus come forward now
[4008.40 - 4010.40] P:1823.91 E:0.063972 |  Kudasov with Vulligard
[4010.40 - 4012.40] P:1776.07 E:0.068352 |  in a prominent position
[4012.40 - 4014.40] P:1713.74 E:0.062533 |  Kudasov tried a clever pass didn't come off
[4014.40 - 4016.40] P:1608.14 E:0.062901 |  an England courtesy of Rooney
[4016.40 - 4018.40] P:1410.97 E:0.072410 |  managed to barz the ball towards the halfway line
[4018.40 - 4020.40] P:1663.87 E:0.057580 |  to at least temporary safety
[4020.40 - 4022.40] P:1454.14 E:0.034789 |  Filipenko
[4022.40 - 4024.40] P:1645.22 E:0.052922 |  leaving it now
[4024.40 - 4026.40] P:1663.42 E:0.048631 |  to Fatiha
[4026.40 - 4028.40] P:1607.20 E:0.051265 |  Fatiha
[4028.40 - 4030.40] P:1617.85 E:0.059584 |  on it goes to Kudasov and quickly
[4030.40 - 4032.40] P:1552.43 E:0.063476 |  to the right full back of a young chook
[4032.40 - 4034.40] P:1637.90 E:0.057225 |  and he's allowed to run forward here
[4034.40 - 4036.40] P:1628.89 E:0.083328 |  can he get a decent passing
[4036.40 - 4038.40] P:1850.20 E:0.073240 |  what a brilliant ball in towards Kulchi
[4038.40 - 4040.40] P:1993.43 E:0.075860 |  Kulchi was challenged by Wernbrunn
[4040.40 - 4042.40] P:2070.86 E:0.066665 |  who tracked the run
[4042.40 - 4044.40] P:2017.70 E:0.078429 |  and just physically
[4044.40 - 4046.40] P:1851.60 E:0.072669 |  Belarus captain off
[4046.40 - 4048.40] P:1979.34 E:0.072211 |  he went down hoping for a penalty
[4048.40 - 4050.40] P:1808.57 E:0.079360 |  referee was watching says no
[4050.40 - 4052.40] P:1891.65 E:0.057789 |  the referee got a clear view of that as well
[4052.40 - 4054.40] P:1783.55 E:0.076700 |  but there's a great run by Kulchi
[4054.40 - 4056.40] P:1695.35 E:0.061107 |  as I say he's nobody to market
[4056.40 - 4058.40] P:1768.96 E:0.062249 |  and he's been a big influence for Belarus
[4058.40 - 4060.40] P:1741.16 E:0.053068 |  what about the cross in term as well
[4060.40 - 4062.40] P:1710.66 E:0.047055 |  good cross
[4062.40 - 4064.40] P:1705.77 E:0.061384 |  technically they are so impressed with Belarus
[4064.40 - 4066.40] P:1461.01 E:0.055669 |  Gerard
[4066.40 - 4068.40] P:1628.78 E:0.069455 |  leaves it for Rooney really tried to pass it back to Gerard
[4068.40 - 4070.40] P:1637.06 E:0.042307 |  didn't come off
[4070.40 - 4072.40] P:1639.06 E:0.055360 |  and here's Petillo
[4072.40 - 4074.40] P:1775.77 E:0.054986 |  Kulchi
[4074.40 - 4076.40] P:1598.13 E:0.056688 |  not as young as the others mind
[4076.40 - 4078.40] P:1682.60 E:0.067249 |  Kulchi
[4078.40 - 4080.40] P:1579.64 E:0.049201 |  now Mollosh
[4080.40 - 4082.40] P:1646.28 E:0.060841 |  on to Vulliga
[4082.40 - 4084.40] P:1793.03 E:0.061807 |  then the left flank
[4084.40 - 4086.40] P:1770.04 E:0.061115 |  back to Mollosh that's good play
[4086.40 - 4088.40] P:1677.91 E:0.074650 |  Walcott was aware of the danger
[4088.40 - 4090.40] P:1657.01 E:0.069989 |  trying to get back there to impede the full back
[4090.40 - 4092.40] P:1766.39 E:0.058324 |  Walcott gets in a challenge
[4092.40 - 4094.40] P:1648.21 E:0.063991 |  and in fact he was fouled by Mollosh
[4094.40 - 4096.40] P:1794.35 E:0.061786 |  it's going to be a free kick to England
[4096.40 - 4098.40] P:1537.21 E:0.067203 |  good tracking there by Walcott
[4098.40 - 4100.40] P:1692.63 E:0.053845 |  and with the pace that he has
[4100.40 - 4102.40] P:1370.76 E:0.070675 |  it's going to be a very forceful back to get away from him
[4102.40 - 4104.40] P:1576.05 E:0.043636 |  how do you think
[4104.40 - 4106.40] P:1598.86 E:0.053411 |  Walcott has played tonight?
[4106.40 - 4108.40] P:1400.61 E:0.070667 |  so so
[4108.40 - 4110.40] P:1533.88 E:0.055195 |  I think he's having to learn all of the time
[4110.40 - 4112.40] P:1711.45 E:0.059340 |  the hat took against Croatia
[4112.40 - 4114.40] P:1544.71 E:0.058554 |  gives that expectancy level all of the time
[4114.40 - 4116.40] P:1526.53 E:0.062458 |  he's not going to do that every game
[4116.40 - 4118.40] P:1672.80 E:0.049022 |  but every now and again we know with the pace that he has
[4118.40 - 4120.40] P:1409.64 E:0.056003 |  he's an outlet for the England player
[4120.40 - 4122.40] P:1666.30 E:0.063600 |  as long as you don't overuse it
[4122.40 - 4124.40] P:1454.11 E:0.045044 |  it's expected to happen all the time
[4124.40 - 4126.40] P:1451.59 E:0.049148 |  gradually you hope
[4126.40 - 4128.40] P:1441.25 E:0.073707 |  that he'll come more and more with his own experience
[4128.40 - 4130.40] P:1574.52 E:0.057516 |  and he'll be more and more surprised when he can make a major effect on the game
[4130.40 - 4132.40] P:1384.48 E:0.066538 |  you won't be surprised if I'm misreading the situation
[4132.40 - 4134.40] P:1674.23 E:0.074043 |  but Arlingen really playing with one white player
[4134.40 - 4136.40] P:1381.55 E:0.059969 |  and Walcott
[4136.40 - 4138.40] P:1614.23 E:0.058022 |  and then and Gerard continually tucked in
[4138.40 - 4140.40] P:1430.70 E:0.080722 |  they're allowing Gerard to go wherever he wants
[4140.40 - 4142.40] P:1571.26 E:0.070317 |  to go you see him now
[4142.40 - 4144.40] P:1515.92 E:0.070206 |  he's in behind
[4144.40 - 4146.40] P:1664.95 E:0.073724 |  in that respect then
[4146.40 - 4148.40] P:1473.67 E:0.064765 |  Runy moves out a little bit wider to the left
[4148.40 - 4150.40] P:1480.06 E:0.062964 |  it doesn't go right out on the flank
[4150.40 - 4152.40] P:1751.50 E:0.041125 |  well
[4152.40 - 4154.40] P:1690.68 E:0.071783 |  unquestionably Gerard and Runy can play together
[4154.40 - 4156.40] P:1758.48 E:0.054547 |  here's a free kick to the Belarus
[4156.40 - 4158.40] P:1781.07 E:0.058861 |  he played 16 minutes in the second half
[4158.40 - 4160.40] P:1668.72 E:0.068018 |  Kulchi the captain
[4160.40 - 4162.40] P:1669.34 E:0.058316 |  the take-out, Heskey hasn't retreated to 10 yards
[4162.40 - 4164.40] P:1742.32 E:0.058831 |  still not 10 yards away
[4164.40 - 4166.40] P:1652.80 E:0.044272 |  Kulchi is patient
[4166.40 - 4168.40] P:1678.27 E:0.044070 |  looking for movement further
[4168.40 - 4170.40] P:1257.61 E:0.070812 |  upfield and then he just slides the ball through the centre circle
[4170.40 - 4172.40] P:1882.94 E:0.074354 |  to Filipenko
[4172.40 - 4174.40] P:1430.49 E:0.045540 |  Filipenko, oh that's a lovely dink pass on
[4174.40 - 4176.40] P:1393.77 E:0.069272 |  to Omelyanchuk
[4176.40 - 4178.40] P:1539.89 E:0.053612 |  Omelyanchuk down the right flank
[4178.40 - 4180.40] P:1479.79 E:0.059059 |  tackled by Wayne Runy
[4180.40 - 4182.40] P:1532.80 E:0.066513 |  Runy's worked harder than anybody tonight
[4182.40 - 4184.40] P:1714.10 E:0.052032 |  a referee I think has misjudged that
[4184.40 - 4186.40] P:1702.11 E:0.062856 |  and has given a free kick
[4186.40 - 4188.40] P:1707.56 E:0.063400 |  yes he's given it on the advice of his assistant
[4188.40 - 4190.40] P:1681.49 E:0.041688 |  which has taken the free kick
[4190.40 - 4192.40] P:1615.63 E:0.064284 |  and rather wasted balls back on the half way line now
[4192.40 - 4194.40] P:1418.65 E:0.064375 |  to Prakotsov
[4194.40 - 4196.40] P:1386.30 E:0.045527 |  Prakotsov to the left flank and Kulchi
[4196.40 - 4198.40] P:1497.41 E:0.060686 |  on it goes to Bullegar
[4198.40 - 4200.40] P:1582.02 E:0.050742 |  back to Prakotsov
[4200.40 - 4202.40] P:1395.61 E:0.043584 |  Prakotsov lifts the pass forward
[4202.40 - 4204.40] P:1635.88 E:0.059695 |  carefully headed away by Ferdinand
[4204.40 - 4206.40] P:1570.98 E:0.063323 |  but worryingly just the last couple of minutes
[4206.40 - 4208.40] P:1596.60 E:0.051568 |  Belarus have seen a lot more of the ball
[4208.40 - 4210.40] P:1688.37 E:0.063597 |  Mollosh
[4210.40 - 4212.40] P:1625.43 E:0.050438 |  infield with the pass
[4212.40 - 4214.40] P:1780.21 E:0.052298 |  to Sitko
[4214.40 - 4216.40] P:1833.25 E:0.056900 |  Sitko being hustled by Wes Brown
[4216.40 - 4218.40] P:1558.76 E:0.052909 |  back now to Kulchi
[4218.40 - 4220.40] P:1773.46 E:0.067705 |  and he just steps away from Emile Heskey
[4220.40 - 4222.40] P:1666.64 E:0.071488 |  isn't he a good player
[4222.40 - 4224.40] P:1631.96 E:0.066198 |  and now back now to Kudasov
[4224.40 - 4226.40] P:1773.91 E:0.053841 |  to Poteo
[4226.40 - 4228.40] P:1693.91 E:0.052976 |  it's not Poteo it's Stasayak
[4228.40 - 4230.40] P:1988.05 E:0.073001 |  the player is saying that I hate the crates
[4230.40 - 4232.40] P:2043.68 E:0.080053 |  because I can't do it
[4232.40 - 4234.40] P:2028.33 E:0.075375 |  just age, isn't it grand
[4234.40 - 4236.40] P:1980.17 E:0.084061 |  anyway he's farmed to free kick
[4236.40 - 4238.40] P:2014.09 E:0.079632 |  Kulchi is a good player
[4238.40 - 4240.40] P:1946.86 E:0.076342 |  34 years of age
[4240.40 - 4242.40] P:1983.09 E:0.072269 |  showing all of his experience
[4242.40 - 4244.40] P:1806.44 E:0.060166 |  and they've taken the free kick
[4244.40 - 4246.40] P:1655.69 E:0.068450 |  Belarus England have to be careful here
[4246.40 - 4248.40] P:1769.98 E:0.071605 |  it is only 2-1 and this side has shown
[4248.40 - 4250.40] P:1548.70 E:0.054710 |  that not only are they tricky
[4250.40 - 4252.40] P:1490.17 E:0.050410 |  not only are they technically good
[4252.40 - 4254.40] P:1451.54 E:0.059055 |  they can't finish as well
[4254.40 - 4257.40] P:1522.85 E:0.060825 |  it's a brilliant move for their initial equalizer
[4257.40 - 4260.40] P:1529.40 E:0.061653 |  now outside of play and it's going to be a throw into Belarus
[4260.40 - 4263.40] P:1531.73 E:0.051194 |  we've played nearly 18 minutes in the second half
[4263.40 - 4266.40] P:1579.97 E:0.060576 |  do you think he might be thinking of a change here
[4266.40 - 4268.40] P:1456.63 E:0.050563 |  Capello
[4268.40 - 4270.40] P:1507.56 E:0.079025 |  I think Sean Wright Phillips is going on
[4270.40 - 4272.40] P:1432.39 E:0.071933 |  he's moving out, he's probably doing very similar
[4272.40 - 4274.40] P:1443.04 E:0.058540 |  and what happened against Kazakhstan
[4276.40 - 4278.40] P:1579.39 E:0.075301 |  some pace against them himself
[4278.40 - 4280.40] P:1568.57 E:0.079391 |  interesting though who he takes off
[4280.40 - 4284.40] P:1601.59 E:0.062849 |  I mean remember he brought Sean Wright Phillips on
[4284.40 - 4286.40] P:1558.47 E:0.068535 |  to play wide with Waukot wide
[4286.40 - 4288.40] P:1651.61 E:0.059985 |  and Jarod and Lampard in the middle
[4288.40 - 4290.40] P:1613.84 E:0.047562 |  here's Rooney
[4290.40 - 4292.40] P:1643.34 E:0.055714 |  blocking one attempted clearance
[4292.40 - 4294.40] P:1607.77 E:0.056373 |  couldn't block the second one
[4294.40 - 4296.40] P:1679.66 E:0.062533 |  and that's
[4296.40 - 4298.40] P:1831.09 E:0.066710 |  Potylo
[4298.40 - 4300.40] P:1622.35 E:0.060861 |  Potylo then lazy little pass to the left hand side
[4300.40 - 4302.40] P:1608.55 E:0.064566 |  and Bridge hits it up field
[4302.40 - 4304.40] P:1687.53 E:0.061778 |  towards Rooney, flags up for offside again
[4306.40 - 4308.40] P:1598.20 E:0.056745 |  seeing a lot of offside this lines one
[4310.40 - 4312.40] P:1471.04 E:0.039765 |  Capello
[4312.40 - 4314.40] P:1512.51 E:0.050172 |  talking to one of his assistants
[4314.40 - 4316.40] P:1582.76 E:0.048373 |  is that Pierce down there
[4316.40 - 4318.40] P:1733.58 E:0.043604 |  it is
[4318.40 - 4320.40] P:1624.86 E:0.081444 |  I wonder which language they're communicating in
[4320.40 - 4322.40] P:1613.22 E:0.061040 |  but no that's not physical, that's Gary Lewis
[4322.40 - 4324.40] P:1655.39 E:0.054999 |  wasn't sure trying to learn Italian
[4324.40 - 4326.40] P:1553.17 E:0.053623 |  he thought that was quicker than waiting for
[4326.40 - 4328.40] P:1680.63 E:0.067137 |  Fabio to learn English
[4328.40 - 4330.40] P:1822.34 E:0.030418 |  no down the left hand flank
[4330.40 - 4332.40] P:1871.15 E:0.055007 |  England on the attack
[4332.40 - 4334.40] P:1708.39 E:0.050951 |  ball just lazily played in
[4334.40 - 4336.40] P:1538.30 E:0.060767 |  that wasn't good
[4336.40 - 4338.40] P:1485.89 E:0.039969 |  and Belarus have it once more
[4338.40 - 4340.40] P:1450.75 E:0.056521 |  Filipenko to the right full back
[4340.40 - 4342.40] P:1424.36 E:0.042427 |  on the Janczuk
[4342.40 - 4344.40] P:1348.71 E:0.056280 |  on to Potylo
[4344.40 - 4346.40] P:1452.50 E:0.034424 |  Potylo
[4346.40 - 4348.40] P:1508.36 E:0.062728 |  beaten to the right side
[4348.40 - 4350.40] P:1631.61 E:0.036163 |  to Sasevich
[4350.40 - 4352.40] P:1576.54 E:0.066079 |  I know Kulci that's a good pass forward
[4352.40 - 4354.40] P:1481.32 E:0.070007 |  lovely football from Belarus
[4354.40 - 4356.40] P:1547.69 E:0.071408 |  and there's a man three in the middle
[4356.40 - 4358.40] P:1648.75 E:0.069364 |  Brian managed to get back though
[4358.40 - 4360.40] P:1650.50 E:0.066639 |  because the lofted pass didn't have enough weight in it
[4360.40 - 4362.40] P:1507.73 E:0.055811 |  to beat Brian
[4362.40 - 4364.40] P:1465.68 E:0.062314 |  and Brian made the interception
[4364.40 - 4366.40] P:1828.79 E:0.076482 |  here's Gerard on towards Heskey
[4366.40 - 4368.40] P:1553.56 E:0.050806 |  the pass over hit and it's through to the goalkeeper Shepinock
[4368.40 - 4370.40] P:1639.42 E:0.059801 |  just early in that
[4370.40 - 4372.40] P:1661.57 E:0.053962 |  if the Belarusian player had got his final pass in
[4372.40 - 4374.40] P:1529.89 E:0.057462 |  it would have opened up England totally on to David James
[4376.40 - 4378.40] P:1562.56 E:0.050153 |  they are a good side
[4378.40 - 4380.40] P:1570.71 E:0.051578 |  there's no question about that
[4380.40 - 4382.40] P:1824.85 E:0.058240 |  but here's Rune
[4382.40 - 4384.40] P:1762.08 E:0.060069 |  who scored in the second half
[4384.40 - 4386.40] P:1588.82 E:0.061482 |  early in the second half to Fittingen
[4386.40 - 4388.40] P:1836.58 E:0.055954 |  two one up and that's still the case
[4388.40 - 4390.40] P:1465.76 E:0.056279 |  with just 25 minutes left to play here
[4390.40 - 4392.40] P:1813.18 E:0.046043 |  on five live sport in the BBC
[4392.40 - 4394.40] P:1712.52 E:0.046005 |  Upset
[4394.40 - 4396.40] P:1655.05 E:0.038534 |  to Ferdinand
[4396.40 - 4398.40] P:1651.09 E:0.062401 |  plenty of time
[4398.40 - 4400.40] P:1678.11 E:0.067518 |  picks out Gerard
[4400.40 - 4402.40] P:1738.80 E:0.065689 |  looking for Walcott
[4402.40 - 4404.40] P:1616.10 E:0.068087 |  Walcott is going to chase after it
[4404.40 - 4406.40] P:1753.09 E:0.062828 |  goalkeeper out of his penalty area
[4406.40 - 4408.40] P:1807.97 E:0.044977 |  and wisely he doesn't try any fancy trick
[4408.40 - 4410.40] P:1671.63 E:0.076009 |  he's going to get rid of that
[4410.40 - 4412.40] P:1603.70 E:0.064186 |  just moving to Wales all the time
[4412.40 - 4414.40] P:1692.12 E:0.060373 |  and then let his side reorganise themselves

[4416.40 - 4418.40] P:1504.37 E:0.070031 |  back to Ferdinand
[4418.40 - 4420.40] P:1667.85 E:0.063897 |  Bridges available
[4420.40 - 4422.40] P:1665.54 E:0.064197 |  Ferdinand doesn't need Bridges at the moment
[4422.40 - 4424.40] P:1710.65 E:0.060696 |  instead he crosses high looking for Heskey
[4424.40 - 4426.40] P:1735.97 E:0.062995 |  Rune waits for the knock down
[4426.40 - 4428.40] P:1685.40 E:0.059242 |  Rune is after it takes it on his chest
[4428.40 - 4430.40] P:1643.93 E:0.057993 |  into the penalty area
[4430.40 - 4432.40] P:1809.75 E:0.065646 |  Rune with the control needs some movement
[4432.40 - 4434.40] P:1669.77 E:0.064629 |  played in but too far in
[4434.40 - 4436.40] P:1513.34 E:0.075646 |  well beyond Gerard
[4436.40 - 4438.40] P:1822.53 E:0.072126 |  he's not going to play himself
[4438.40 - 4440.40] P:1536.47 E:0.064139 |  doesn't he?
[4440.40 - 4442.40] P:1591.58 E:0.058311 |  his body lounge is just perfect
[4442.40 - 4444.40] P:1672.20 E:0.031019 |  doesn't matter how the ball is coming to him
[4444.40 - 4446.40] P:1751.47 E:0.064054 |  his first touch is excellent
[4446.40 - 4448.40] P:1721.56 E:0.068941 |  Belarus though
[4448.40 - 4450.40] P:1805.51 E:0.067592 |  they look frequently happy in possession
[4450.40 - 4452.40] P:1599.14 E:0.046928 |  on the attack again
[4452.40 - 4454.40] P:1616.00 E:0.069391 |  Gerard gets an attack
[4454.40 - 4456.40] P:1648.41 E:0.062319 |  the first challenge is actually made by Lampard
[4456.40 - 4458.40] P:1542.77 E:0.058792 |  that put off the Belarus player
[4458.40 - 4460.40] P:1658.11 E:0.061475 |  it's clear to the halfway line
[4460.40 - 4462.40] P:1877.11 E:0.063337 |  but the referee has blown his whistle for a free kick
[4462.40 - 4464.40] P:1800.28 E:0.062987 |  and here's a change
[4464.40 - 4466.40] P:1805.59 E:0.062377 |  Modrich has made it
[4466.40 - 4468.40] P:1616.48 E:0.066634 |  Croatia 3 and Doran 0
[4468.40 - 4470.40] P:1684.10 E:0.048311 |  the change here
[4470.40 - 4472.40] P:1607.61 E:0.052810 |  is bringing Rodionov
[4472.40 - 4474.40] P:1634.01 E:0.052442 |  on and taking off
[4474.40 - 4476.40] P:1455.86 E:0.038659 |  have they got that right
[4476.40 - 4478.40] P:1586.18 E:0.053915 |  they're taking off Petio
[4478.40 - 4480.40] P:1582.58 E:0.046089 |  who's impressed me
[4480.40 - 4482.40] P:1749.36 E:0.065031 |  and John Wright thoughts will be coming on now for England
[4482.40 - 4484.40] P:1802.38 E:0.057978 |  who for
[4486.40 - 4488.40] P:1777.87 E:0.059622 |  well Rodionov is a striker
[4488.40 - 4490.40] P:1800.57 E:0.045864 |  Petio is much more of a
[4490.40 - 4492.40] P:1822.11 E:0.064576 |  central midfield player
[4492.40 - 4494.40] P:1753.16 E:0.062476 |  obviously Stanger feels
[4494.40 - 4496.40] P:1808.71 E:0.062526 |  he has to introduce something
[4496.40 - 4498.40] P:1624.72 E:0.042558 |  further up front
[4498.40 - 4500.40] P:1647.48 E:0.056507 |  trying to search for the second equalizer
[4500.40 - 4502.40] P:1592.84 E:0.057893 |  where's the fourth official goal
[4502.40 - 4504.40] P:1665.37 E:0.032033 |  he's gone to sit down
[4504.40 - 4506.40] P:1714.05 E:0.056497 |  and he doesn't realise he's got
[4506.40 - 4508.40] P:1814.59 E:0.061578 |  this is silly
[4508.40 - 4510.40] P:1918.48 E:0.062739 |  Capello is very frustrated about this
[4510.40 - 4512.40] P:1794.38 E:0.051811 |  so too is Ray Clemens what is going on
[4512.40 - 4514.40] P:1564.29 E:0.042182 |  can he not press the button twice
[4514.40 - 4516.40] P:1816.19 E:0.045953 |  he's actually sat down the fourth official
[4516.40 - 4518.40] P:1407.82 E:0.067263 |  and players resumed
[4518.40 - 4520.40] P:1561.44 E:0.070850 |  England have the ball down this flight
[4520.40 - 4522.40] P:1062.17 E:0.050763 |  he's sitting outside for a throw in
[4522.40 - 4524.40] P:1539.70 E:0.073966 |  and the fourth official still isn't ready
[4524.40 - 4526.40] P:1445.16 E:0.058992 |  it's a joke
[4526.40 - 4528.40] P:1291.82 E:0.063422 |  referee's looking across it's in
[4528.40 - 4530.40] P:1511.16 E:0.058492 |  because he's made plays, made play continue
[4530.40 - 4532.40] P:1277.19 E:0.075914 |  but there's some trouble down there
[4532.40 - 4534.40] P:1632.89 E:0.080691 |  isn't there now on England Benzer
[4534.40 - 4536.40] P:1848.03 E:0.072413 |  complaining bitterly towards the fourth official
[4536.40 - 4538.40] P:1934.30 E:0.059741 |  he's sat down
[4538.40 - 4540.40] P:1830.02 E:0.056140 |  is he on this planet
[4540.40 - 4542.40] P:1403.96 E:0.078552 |  here he comes
[4542.40 - 4544.40] P:1289.69 E:0.063451 |  and finally it's not the referee's fault
[4544.40 - 4546.40] P:1712.88 E:0.059475 |  but here we have the change
[4546.40 - 4548.40] P:1339.02 E:0.070581 |  and it's Sean Wright Phillips for Theo Walkock
[4548.40 - 4550.40] P:1405.70 E:0.054033 |  Alan Green to Mike Inge
[4550.40 - 4552.40] P:1730.38 E:0.063237 |  well that was really simple wasn't it
[4552.40 - 4554.40] P:1800.80 E:0.060870 |  Rodion off then comes on also
[4554.40 - 4556.40] P:1754.17 E:0.077446 |  for the home team he plays for
[4556.40 - 4558.40] P:1787.19 E:0.043597 |  Bate who did really well
[4558.40 - 4560.40] P:1922.66 E:0.077631 |  in that champions league game against
[4560.40 - 4562.40] P:1851.19 E:0.032049 |  Uventus
[4562.40 - 4564.40] P:1896.66 E:0.083255 |  but there are still one or two alarms here
[4564.40 - 4566.40] P:1854.88 E:0.077028 |  for England there are still a few holes
[4566.40 - 4568.40] P:1821.50 E:0.051148 |  that England aren't filling in midfield
[4568.40 - 4570.40] P:1792.49 E:0.071404 |  Barry at times struggling to come to terms
[4570.40 - 4572.40] P:1592.11 E:0.067700 |  in fact Lampard and Barry have been playing quite deep
[4572.40 - 4574.40] P:1618.32 E:0.066536 |  in this second half together
[4574.40 - 4576.40] P:1565.26 E:0.062009 |  allowing Gerard as Alan and Graham have been saying
[4576.40 - 4578.40] P:1564.70 E:0.076087 |  to get in behind Heskey and Rooney
[4578.40 - 4580.40] P:1225.30 E:0.040132 |  it's a
[4580.40 - 4582.40] P:1636.80 E:0.068806 |  quite an odd shape that England are playing at the moment
[4582.40 - 4584.40] P:1842.21 E:0.079313 |  but they have the lead and Rooney finds Gerard
[4584.40 - 4586.40] P:1779.59 E:0.066139 |  Gerard too many players from Belarus in front of him
[4586.40 - 4588.40] P:1708.09 E:0.076010 |  has to give the ball back to Barry
[4588.40 - 4590.40] P:1844.73 E:0.067767 |  Barry will work it to the far side of the field
[4590.40 - 4592.40] P:1900.41 E:0.069658 |  Bridge doesn't control the ball
[4592.40 - 4594.40] P:1844.93 E:0.068863 |  should have done and the back pass
[4594.40 - 4596.40] P:1651.11 E:0.063556 |  to the goalkeeper is cleared
[4596.40 - 4598.40] P:1318.94 E:0.048725 |  by Zevnoff
[4598.40 - 4600.40] P:1393.22 E:0.072277 |  England leading here by
[4600.40 - 4602.40] P:1882.64 E:0.061675 |  two goals to one
[4602.40 - 4604.40] P:1818.09 E:0.068719 |  twice they've managed to get themselves in front here
[4604.40 - 4606.40] P:1813.13 E:0.071126 |  Gerard first of all after 11 minutes
[4606.40 - 4608.40] P:1744.46 E:0.066642 |  an equaliser from a sick co after 28
[4608.40 - 4610.40] P:1744.53 E:0.064379 |  and then Rooney giving England the lead
[4610.40 - 4612.40] P:1519.56 E:0.076608 |  right at the start of the second half
[4612.40 - 4614.40] P:1645.84 E:0.058154 |  five minutes into the second half
[4614.40 - 4616.40] P:1627.38 E:0.067326 |  and one of the big differences between this campaign
[4616.40 - 4618.40] P:1834.39 E:0.068912 |  and the last campaign so far
[4618.40 - 4620.40] P:1645.77 E:0.068929 |  Rooney remember missed many of the Euro qualifying games
[4620.40 - 4622.40] P:1618.77 E:0.071503 |  don't think he scored at all in the Euro qualifiers
[4622.40 - 4624.40] P:1708.92 E:0.081082 |  but he's now got four in three
[4624.40 - 4626.40] P:1765.02 E:0.060815 |  for Fabio Cappello
[4626.40 - 4628.40] P:1675.24 E:0.060998 |  England lead to one
[4628.40 - 4630.40] P:1646.81 E:0.063966 |  and Peter Crouch is also going to come on
[4630.40 - 4632.40] P:1785.60 E:0.064353 |  in a moment presumably for Emil
[4632.40 - 4634.40] P:1669.16 E:0.073589 |  Hescu's really worked hard tonight
[4634.40 - 4636.40] P:1832.77 E:0.069278 |  had to take quite a lot of stick as well
[4636.40 - 4638.40] P:1689.82 E:0.063633 |  in some of the tackling
[4638.40 - 4640.40] P:1737.70 E:0.052337 |  Belarus always dangerous
[4640.40 - 4642.40] P:1823.56 E:0.073751 |  when they go forward
[4642.40 - 4644.40] P:1775.42 E:0.069985 |  they build down this left hand side of the field
[4644.40 - 4646.40] P:1719.73 E:0.064791 |  with Mollosh
[4646.40 - 4648.40] P:1763.88 E:0.052446 |  Mollosh to the goalkeeper's sick co
[4648.40 - 4650.40] P:1669.83 E:0.064085 |  now the very clever Katoosoff
[4650.40 - 4652.40] P:1740.81 E:0.039174 |  and his striking partner
[4652.40 - 4654.40] P:1620.67 E:0.076053 |  Bulligar but Gerard wins it back
[4654.40 - 4656.40] P:1826.41 E:0.069609 |  strong all the referees
[4656.40 - 4658.40] P:1904.14 E:0.073277 |  penalising Stephen Jar but now England can make the second change
[4658.40 - 4660.40] P:1947.10 E:0.054738 |  Crouch steps forward wearing the number 18
[4660.40 - 4662.40] P:1764.41 E:0.072764 |  and he will come on for Emil
[4662.40 - 4664.40] P:1801.59 E:0.069029 |  Hescu who's absolutely worked his socks off here tonight
[4664.40 - 4666.40] P:1746.70 E:0.068430 |  Graham and of course made the goal for Wayne Rooney
[4666.40 - 4668.40] P:1750.16 E:0.061320 |  I think Emil Hescu since his return to the England side
[4668.40 - 4670.40] P:1750.89 E:0.064961 |  has done extremely well
[4670.40 - 4672.40] P:1751.06 E:0.068860 |  and the combination of him and Rooney
[4672.40 - 4674.40] P:1776.95 E:0.067599 |  is very very threatening
[4674.40 - 4676.40] P:1699.69 E:0.077326 |  being able to bring Crouch on as well
[4676.40 - 4678.40] P:1595.46 E:0.058256 |  you know there's no doubt about it
[4678.40 - 4680.40] P:1333.57 E:0.081970 |  it doesn't matter what anybody says
[4680.40 - 4682.40] P:1703.99 E:0.054222 |  you get a big centre forward
[4682.40 - 4684.40] P:1548.53 E:0.073362 |  England of all nations know how to use them
[4684.40 - 4686.40] P:1478.05 E:0.072648 |  Hescu gets a deserved handshake
[4686.40 - 4688.40] P:1339.61 E:0.055462 |  from the UK
[4688.40 - 4690.40] P:1750.58 E:0.075906 |  as the dangerous Belarus side
[4690.40 - 4692.40] P:1359.53 E:0.072077 |  build once more on the edge of the area
[4692.40 - 4694.40] P:1761.26 E:0.079413 |  clever turn by Bulligar
[4694.40 - 4696.40] P:1778.60 E:0.084492 |  back pass from Ferdinand though
[4696.40 - 4698.40] P:1813.30 E:0.066072 |  swept down field by David James
[4698.40 - 4700.40] P:1854.08 E:0.064904 |  who's cleared the ball pretty well
[4700.40 - 4702.40] P:1781.11 E:0.067326 |  and it's been on his feet here this evening
[4702.40 - 4704.40] P:1721.39 E:0.075506 |  out comes the Belarus goalkeeper now
[4704.40 - 4706.40] P:1530.56 E:0.059347 |  and it's with the Kotsoff
[4706.40 - 4708.40] P:1277.01 E:0.044217 |  the defender
[4708.40 - 4710.40] P:1589.81 E:0.068348 |  the Kotsoff moves towards the half way line
[4710.40 - 4712.40] P:1704.28 E:0.064426 |  unchallenged yet by anyone in a white shirt
[4712.40 - 4714.40] P:1617.16 E:0.069910 |  gives the ball away though
[4714.40 - 4716.40] P:1832.81 E:0.061357 |  right Philips who's just come on
[4716.40 - 4718.40] P:1767.35 E:0.055223 |  for Walcott
[4718.40 - 4720.40] P:1854.92 E:0.075440 |  right Philips showing his pace immediately down this right hand side
[4720.40 - 4722.40] P:1875.41 E:0.062239 |  inviting the challenge from the fall back
[4722.40 - 4724.40] P:1807.43 E:0.054951 |  Mollosh and England win the throw in
[4724.40 - 4726.40] P:1637.97 E:0.053935 |  almost half way inside the Belarus half
[4726.40 - 4728.40] P:1785.68 E:0.060820 |  although Brown is going to take it
[4728.40 - 4730.40] P:1764.63 E:0.059505 |  from much further back just in front of Fabio Capello
[4730.40 - 4732.40] P:1626.70 E:0.057181 |  there's been a goal in Belfast
[4732.40 - 4734.40] P:1921.00 E:0.074795 |  Ian Dennis
[4734.40 - 4736.40] P:1892.80 E:0.084259 |  Northern Ireland 3, San Marino 0
[4736.40 - 4738.40] P:2001.07 E:0.067383 |  that's what the goalkeeper was doing
[4738.40 - 4740.40] P:1872.40 E:0.077395 |  soft shot from Healy
[4740.40 - 4742.40] P:1823.44 E:0.076538 |  and the keeper just powered it into the path of Carl Lapety
[4742.40 - 4744.40] P:1854.85 E:0.072535 |  there is bad as the dog and duck San Marino
[4744.40 - 4746.40] P:1787.24 E:0.056566 |  Northern Ireland
[4746.40 - 4748.40] P:1770.56 E:0.072821 |  thank you very much one of the Belarus players has taken the ball
[4748.40 - 4750.40] P:1702.95 E:0.061368 |  straight in the face there from Wayne Rooney
[4750.40 - 4752.40] P:1674.15 E:0.058185 |  and he's dazed and confused
[4752.40 - 4754.40] P:1691.84 E:0.054200 |  so the game will have to restart
[4754.40 - 4756.40] P:1810.90 E:0.060138 |  but
[4756.40 - 4758.40] P:1749.32 E:0.030974 |  it does give Graham Taylor a chance
[4758.40 - 4760.40] P:1922.92 E:0.069719 |  just to give us his thoughts
[4760.40 - 4762.40] P:1803.58 E:0.049800 |  let me see again how long we got here
[4762.40 - 4764.40] P:1710.86 E:0.069317 |  Graham
[4764.40 - 4766.40] P:1839.09 E:0.057009 |  well I think that
[4766.40 - 4768.40] P:1877.29 E:0.061950 |  England just have to
[4768.40 - 4770.40] P:1903.88 E:0.071243 |  make sure they keep
[4770.40 - 4772.40] P:1950.24 E:0.058826 |  they wouldn't say the pressure
[4772.40 - 4774.40] P:1834.69 E:0.068946 |  but their own game
[4774.40 - 4776.40] P:2004.17 E:0.067418 |  just in shape as I call it
[4776.40 - 4778.40] P:1808.56 E:0.062764 |  to make sure they're not pulled all over the pitch
[4778.40 - 4780.40] P:1783.43 E:0.059272 |  and I think they've done well in the second half
[4780.40 - 4782.40] P:1661.91 E:0.077545 |  because you know come
[4782.40 - 4784.40] P:1853.43 E:0.061235 |  half time we saw Belarus
[4784.40 - 4786.40] P:1671.55 E:0.067310 |  performance one-one and you're thinking
[4786.40 - 4788.40] P:1377.51 E:0.075191 |  if they come out and play as they did in the first half
[4788.40 - 4790.40] P:1633.69 E:0.065670 |  then in fact
[4790.40 - 4792.40] P:1626.21 E:0.070519 |  England may be in trouble
[4792.40 - 4794.40] P:1566.05 E:0.065543 |  but they've really I think England have done well
[4794.40 - 4796.40] P:1605.02 E:0.065426 |  this second half and Belarus
[4796.40 - 4798.40] P:1637.52 E:0.062872 |  haven't been able to attack
[4798.40 - 4800.40] P:1673.31 E:0.056043 |  and have that movement and possession
[4800.40 - 4802.40] P:1723.90 E:0.049088 |  that they've had in the first half
[4802.40 - 4804.40] P:1767.64 E:0.068943 |  if you suspect Graham there could be a physical factor here as well
[4804.40 - 4806.40] P:1572.26 E:0.048511 |  bringing someone on like
[4806.40 - 4808.40] P:1791.44 E:0.072479 |  right Phillips is going to test them isn't it
[4808.40 - 4810.40] P:1707.37 E:0.066453 |  of course it is, just watching
[4810.40 - 4812.40] P:1722.84 E:0.072605 |  England against Croatia
[4812.40 - 4814.40] P:1746.42 E:0.050947 |  against Kazakhstan
[4814.40 - 4816.40] P:1879.47 E:0.059423 |  as the games progress the fitness
[4816.40 - 4818.40] P:1801.64 E:0.068544 |  of the England players in those two
[4818.40 - 4820.40] P:1927.39 E:0.066095 |  previous games and I suspect in this one
[4820.40 - 4822.40] P:1766.18 E:0.054789 |  is beginning to show
[4822.40 - 4824.40] P:1849.54 E:0.061786 |  Stas Javich was the player that got the ball in the face
[4824.40 - 4826.40] P:1544.75 E:0.071745 |  and he really has impressed us all here this evening
[4826.40 - 4828.40] P:1428.36 E:0.057644 |  made the goal
[4828.40 - 4830.40] P:1556.57 E:0.035662 |  he would
[4830.40 - 4832.40] P:1669.13 E:0.069399 |  scored by the way in that game against
[4832.40 - 4834.40] P:1582.97 E:0.063589 |  Juventus for Batte gave
[4834.40 - 4836.40] P:1855.03 E:0.063516 |  Batte a one-nil lead in that match which was eventually
[4836.40 - 4838.40] P:1553.63 E:0.052493 |  two-two
[4838.40 - 4840.40] P:1642.78 E:0.063957 |  the ball is back with Zevnoff in the
[4840.40 - 4842.40] P:1697.47 E:0.066807 |  home goal away to our right the crowd just a little quieter now
[4842.40 - 4844.40] P:1586.53 E:0.060926 |  long ball down field bridge jumping over
[4844.40 - 4846.40] P:1472.60 E:0.047944 |  on the far side of the field
[4846.40 - 4848.40] P:1621.49 E:0.064140 |  bridge still needs to come in again
[4848.40 - 4850.40] P:1533.18 E:0.078829 |  that looked like a hand ball for him here but the referee was happy
[4850.40 - 4852.40] P:1809.68 E:0.063630 |  and bridge slides the ball to this near side of the field
[4852.40 - 4854.40] P:1701.32 E:0.049566 |  right Phillips is there
[4854.40 - 4856.40] P:1593.45 E:0.059556 |  helps it back to Brown, Brown of England
[4856.40 - 4858.40] P:1742.93 E:0.065900 |  leading here by two one on five life
[4858.40 - 4860.40] P:1744.77 E:0.064727 |  and now Brown's just sky the ball out of play
[4860.40 - 4862.40] P:1744.39 E:0.058569 |  into the running track down there for a Belarus throw
[4864.40 - 4866.40] P:1706.84 E:0.062059 |  England have to concentrate here because they
[4866.40 - 4868.40] P:1743.46 E:0.068606 |  they change the ball very quickly
[4868.40 - 4870.40] P:1825.31 E:0.070601 |  they throw it back on again and England have to be alive
[4870.40 - 4872.40] P:1741.28 E:0.074294 |  we'll go to the Germany Wales game in a moment
[4872.40 - 4874.40] P:1614.19 E:0.056790 |  but now it's on the on the land chalk
[4874.40 - 4876.40] P:1713.52 E:0.074703 |  the right back down the Belarus right
[4876.40 - 4878.40] P:1879.34 E:0.061981 |  England mustn't allow Belarus too much
[4878.40 - 4880.40] P:1799.52 E:0.063826 |  possession back to Conomak Nomura watching
[4880.40 - 4882.40] P:1811.83 E:0.074017 |  Germany Wales. Germany nil, Wales nil
[4882.40 - 4884.40] P:2019.81 E:0.076539 |  John Toshak will be impressed with this
[4884.40 - 4886.40] P:2211.79 E:0.071159 |  Germany's frustration means that Wales are growing in confidence
[4886.40 - 4888.40] P:1839.94 E:0.066327 |  the home crowd has got restless
[4888.40 - 4890.40] P:1957.94 E:0.075400 |  the more Germany push forward
[4890.40 - 4892.40] P:2005.03 E:0.073144 |  the more gaps they leave at the back
[4892.40 - 4894.40] P:2004.03 E:0.063518 |  Wales have had three chances in the past few minutes
[4894.40 - 4896.40] P:1933.45 E:0.064732 |  the best of them for Bellamy
[4896.40 - 4898.40] P:2213.62 E:0.071457 |  he was denied by a super save from René Adler
[4898.40 - 4900.40] P:1997.52 E:0.071207 |  it's a really good game this
[4900.40 - 4902.40] P:2077.25 E:0.067612 |  Germany nil, Wales nil
[4902.40 - 4904.40] P:1912.83 E:0.075998 |  thank you Conomak, England missed the boat there
[4904.40 - 4906.40] P:1769.63 E:0.082556 |  they had a real opportunity when they got right
[4906.40 - 4908.40] P:1801.60 E:0.079682 |  Phillips and Gerard and Rooney forward
[4908.40 - 4910.40] P:1901.18 E:0.069044 |  but they just couldn't force it
[4910.40 - 4912.40] P:1931.45 E:0.066395 |  Rooney eventually had a shot which was blocked
[4912.40 - 4914.40] P:1916.92 E:0.070020 |  a nice turn now from right Phillips in between
[4914.40 - 4916.40] P:1854.48 E:0.059287 |  two of the Belarus defenders
[4916.40 - 4918.40] P:1905.97 E:0.057053 |  right Phillips and now Lampard steps in
[4918.40 - 4920.40] P:1755.72 E:0.074365 |  that was an opportunity for England to put this game
[4920.40 - 4922.40] P:1843.63 E:0.077171 |  because we feel here that if England get another one
[4922.40 - 4924.40] P:1946.69 E:0.076028 |  then that should be enough
[4924.40 - 4926.40] P:1845.37 E:0.055218 |  Belarus won England too on five life
[4926.40 - 4928.40] P:1874.53 E:0.067010 |  bridge now for England looking for Rooney
[4928.40 - 4930.40] P:1814.01 E:0.081819 |  to Gerard instead Rooney in the error
[4930.40 - 4932.40] P:1727.33 E:0.077684 |  Rooney for England and that must be it
[4932.40 - 4934.40] P:1866.59 E:0.082710 |  Rooney's done it again
[4934.40 - 4936.40] P:1884.06 E:0.073708 |  three one here tonight
[4936.40 - 4938.40] P:1814.27 E:0.082836 |  Rooney in amazing forms in this world
[4938.40 - 4940.40] P:1691.19 E:0.066696 |  qualifying campaign has now scored
[4940.40 - 4942.40] P:1822.75 E:0.067131 |  five in three
[4942.40 - 4944.40] P:1790.89 E:0.077534 |  England lead three one
[4944.40 - 4946.40] P:1718.74 E:0.067370 |  excellent play by England
[4946.40 - 4948.40] P:1592.77 E:0.080279 |  you talk about the passing movement
[4948.40 - 4950.40] P:1742.30 E:0.061418 |  it was there for all to see
[4950.40 - 4952.40] P:1890.56 E:0.077591 |  bridge came it in moved it in
[4952.40 - 4954.40] P:1757.83 E:0.065599 |  then there was combination play between Gerard and Rooney
[4954.40 - 4956.40] P:1722.18 E:0.083035 |  for Rooney to finish off
[4956.40 - 4958.40] P:1756.14 E:0.057794 |  so comfortably and so confidently
[4958.40 - 4960.40] P:1571.20 E:0.072566 |  Rooney you can see as we've mentioned
[4960.40 - 4962.40] P:1682.87 E:0.070263 |  a lot of times he's playing exceptionally well
[4962.40 - 4964.40] P:1581.34 E:0.080410 |  he looks happy
[4964.40 - 4966.40] P:1624.00 E:0.068866 |  he is happy
[4966.40 - 4968.40] P:1556.74 E:0.073145 |  he's every right to be happy
[4968.40 - 4970.40] P:1422.87 E:0.063756 |  because the way that he took that goal
[4970.40 - 4972.40] P:1648.24 E:0.063514 |  was absolutely first class
[4976.40 - 4978.40] P:1734.80 E:0.059345 |  well much relief
[4978.40 - 4980.40] P:1432.59 E:0.066996 |  and you know
[4980.40 - 4982.40] P:1359.20 E:0.070865 |  when you've got people like Rooney and Gerard
[4982.40 - 4984.40] P:1531.37 E:0.057944 |  in the team you've got half a chance haven't you
[4984.40 - 4986.40] P:1714.12 E:0.073501 |  you certainly have what's been interesting
[4986.40 - 4988.40] P:1608.87 E:0.060065 |  about Gerard for the last 10 to 15 minutes
[4988.40 - 4990.40] P:1552.07 E:0.070768 |  he hasn't played on that left side at all
[4990.40 - 4992.40] P:1738.33 E:0.062145 |  he's been central in behind
[4992.40 - 4994.40] P:1535.41 E:0.075863 |  Rooney and now Crouch
[4994.40 - 4996.40] P:1714.10 E:0.059921 |  originally Heskey but he's been much more
[4996.40 - 4998.40] P:1687.95 E:0.070910 |  cross central
[4998.40 - 5000.40] P:1635.63 E:0.065119 |  there's an interesting point to pick up on that when we get in a moment
[5000.40 - 5002.40] P:1637.71 E:0.069017 |  because we were talking at half time
[5002.40 - 5004.40] P:1715.54 E:0.063104 |  and we felt that Couchy was having too much of the ball
[5004.40 - 5006.40] P:1831.89 E:0.067914 |  too much influence nobody was pressurizing him
[5006.40 - 5008.40] P:1682.17 E:0.068446 |  I wonder whether that was intended by Capello
[5008.40 - 5010.40] P:1700.54 E:0.066191 |  to push Gerard in there
[5010.40 - 5012.40] P:1663.04 E:0.067981 |  and to really make Couchy
[5012.40 - 5014.40] P:1497.78 E:0.054027 |  have to do more defending
[5014.40 - 5016.40] P:1904.85 E:0.071114 |  because he was so influential in that first half
[5016.40 - 5018.40] P:1802.22 E:0.072339 |  now will Behrouz be able to respond once more
[5018.40 - 5020.40] P:1648.84 E:0.054740 |  no Lampard's won the ball
[5020.40 - 5022.40] P:1610.09 E:0.070861 |  Lampard is playing in a very disciplined role now
[5022.40 - 5024.40] P:1817.68 E:0.073585 |  he's having to curb his natural style
[5024.40 - 5026.40] P:1764.50 E:0.063875 |  isn't he and sit alongside Gareth Barry
[5026.40 - 5028.40] P:1342.96 E:0.071728 |  well I think they've done well as well
[5028.40 - 5030.40] P:1464.36 E:0.066217 |  it's like the second half against Kazakhstan
[5030.40 - 5032.40] P:1459.50 E:0.062424 |  where we play with two wide men in the second half
[5032.40 - 5034.40] P:1492.15 E:0.070412 |  and Gerard and Lampard stayed in there
[5034.40 - 5036.40] P:1744.92 E:0.070794 |  and now it's Barry and Lampard doing it
[5036.40 - 5038.40] P:1652.78 E:0.054721 |  and there have been moments also in this game
[5038.40 - 5040.40] P:1626.92 E:0.072846 |  when Rio Ferdinand's had to
[5040.40 - 5042.40] P:1593.61 E:0.070649 |  assert himself at the back there
[5042.40 - 5044.40] P:1938.75 E:0.062339 |  in the absence of John Terry and Ashley Cole
[5044.40 - 5046.40] P:1956.08 E:0.077125 |  holding it all together
[5046.40 - 5048.40] P:1999.79 E:0.075804 |  the England captain
[5048.40 - 5050.40] P:2005.86 E:0.085573 |  the England fans are singing
[5050.40 - 5052.40] P:2082.36 E:0.078132 |  Belarus won
[5052.40 - 5054.40] P:2016.28 E:0.083056 |  Croatia 4
[5054.40 - 5056.40] P:2065.81 E:0.081902 |  and Oren 0
[5056.40 - 5058.40] P:2009.86 E:0.082624 |  but the thing is Graeme if England can get the three points here
[5058.40 - 5060.40] P:1992.61 E:0.072309 |  size like Croatia and Ukraine
[5060.40 - 5062.40] P:1902.49 E:0.085302 |  are they going to have the problems there
[5062.40 - 5064.40] P:1988.13 E:0.074281 |  they're not going to find it easy to come here
[5064.40 - 5066.40] P:1943.58 E:0.080367 |  and get the wins
[5066.40 - 5068.40] P:1984.90 E:0.076046 |  there's no doubt Mike talking that Gerard
[5068.40 - 5070.40] P:1920.22 E:0.069206 |  is certainly playing in that hole
[5070.40 - 5072.40] P:1662.57 E:0.079652 |  behind Runey behind Crouch now
[5072.40 - 5074.40] P:1840.75 E:0.062921 |  and it means that to Couchy
[5074.40 - 5076.40] P:1820.95 E:0.068810 |  when he gets the ball has someone
[5076.40 - 5078.40] P:1630.48 E:0.069377 |  in and around him
[5078.40 - 5080.40] P:1346.96 E:0.067708 |  and if Capello has done that
[5080.40 - 5082.40] P:1510.82 E:0.072181 |  that is a good move because there is no doubt
[5082.40 - 5084.40] P:1486.29 E:0.062704 |  that Couchy was a very dominant
[5084.40 - 5086.40] P:1459.01 E:0.066352 |  and influential player
[5086.40 - 5088.40] P:1246.00 E:0.070777 |  for Belarus in the first half
[5088.40 - 5090.40] P:1640.90 E:0.071422 |  we certainly haven't seen so much of him
[5090.40 - 5092.40] P:1576.01 E:0.061050 |  this half
[5092.40 - 5094.40] P:1554.88 E:0.070625 |  Gerard has got the exactly the sort of role
[5094.40 - 5096.40] P:1515.96 E:0.069453 |  the sort of player that has always been
[5096.40 - 5098.40] P:1775.58 E:0.072182 |  too hot to handle for England over the years
[5098.40 - 5100.40] P:1873.32 E:0.070716 |  the player that just goes in behind the strikers
[5100.40 - 5102.40] P:1491.15 E:0.048311 |  difficult to pick up
[5102.40 - 5105.40] P:1624.55 E:0.075390 |  and Gerard is thriving but Runey is going to get the headlines again
[5105.40 - 5107.40] P:1703.63 E:0.078832 |  he got a goal against Croatia in Sargreb
[5107.40 - 5109.40] P:1710.51 E:0.065185 |  he got the two against Kazakhstan
[5109.40 - 5112.40] P:1524.57 E:0.066375 |  at the weekend although Fabio Capello thought he got three
[5112.40 - 5115.40] P:1725.45 E:0.063228 |  and two more tonight to build on Gerard's
[5115.40 - 5117.40] P:1717.58 E:0.054545 |  fantastic early strike
[5117.40 - 5119.40] P:1936.97 E:0.072962 |  Belarus won England three on five live
[5119.40 - 5122.40] P:1876.42 E:0.070364 |  it's a different atmosphere now as Gerard goes charging again
[5122.40 - 5124.40] P:1849.99 E:0.063247 |  forward down that left hand side
[5124.40 - 5125.40] P:1875.30 E:0.070586 |  whips it in with his right foot
[5125.40 - 5127.40] P:1871.96 E:0.065777 |  Crouch tries to get on the end of it
[5127.40 - 5128.40] P:1938.19 E:0.069794 |  Belarus don't clear
[5128.40 - 5130.40] P:1895.07 E:0.069790 |  Crouch once more has a possibility
[5130.40 - 5133.40] P:1745.85 E:0.061062 |  Belarus the referee's whistle's gone
[5133.40 - 5135.40] P:1743.37 E:0.045774 |  a challenge by Crouch
[5135.40 - 5137.40] P:1550.20 E:0.073245 |  he does tend to get penalized a lot in Europe
[5137.40 - 5139.40] P:1720.82 E:0.062475 |  Peter Crouch free kick to Belarus on the edge of their area
[5139.40 - 5141.40] P:1359.92 E:0.070588 |  I think he pulled the defender back there actually
[5141.40 - 5143.40] P:1501.97 E:0.064966 |  I agree with you
[5143.40 - 5145.40] P:1489.94 E:0.068232 |  you know when you're that size and what have you
[5145.40 - 5147.40] P:1672.64 E:0.056556 |  get some unfair free kicks given you
[5147.40 - 5149.40] P:1348.90 E:0.058405 |  that time I think the referee got it right
[5149.40 - 5152.40] P:1627.14 E:0.059872 |  because Crouch did pull the Belarus player back
[5152.40 - 5154.40] P:1704.36 E:0.069538 |  Strakhanovich by the way has come on
[5154.40 - 5156.40] P:1699.24 E:0.066935 |  for the very impressive Katoosov
[5156.40 - 5158.40] P:1570.62 E:0.053318 |  who plays in Italy with Palmer
[5158.40 - 5160.40] P:1654.81 E:0.071671 |  so England a little bit pleased to see the back of Katoosov
[5160.40 - 5163.40] P:1736.89 E:0.066701 |  England appear now to have this game under control
[5163.40 - 5165.40] P:1743.60 E:0.060559 |  with less than 15 minutes to go
[5165.40 - 5167.40] P:1627.14 E:0.065790 |  the ball is out of play on the far side
[5167.40 - 5169.40] P:1682.09 E:0.045169 |  and we're going back to belfast again
[5169.40 - 5171.40] P:1840.29 E:0.072984 |  and Ian Dennis
[5171.40 - 5173.40] P:1812.62 E:0.082357 |  Samarino down to 10 men Mike
[5173.40 - 5175.40] P:1806.94 E:0.083817 |  Northern Ireland still lead 3-0 but Mauro Morani
[5175.40 - 5177.40] P:1764.26 E:0.069830 |  lashed out at Michael O'Connor and has been sent off
[5177.40 - 5179.40] P:1594.39 E:0.076652 |  Northern Ireland 3 Samarino 0
[5179.40 - 5182.40] P:1526.96 E:0.058378 |  thanks Ian so 2 against Andorra
[5182.40 - 5183.40] P:1696.42 E:0.074647 |  4 against Croatia
[5183.40 - 5184.40] P:1764.72 E:0.065363 |  5 against Kazakhstan
[5184.40 - 5185.40] P:1804.03 E:0.066006 |  and 3 against Belarus
[5185.40 - 5187.40] P:1470.29 E:0.072476 |  England are finding the back of the net
[5187.40 - 5189.40] P:1600.94 E:0.058329 |  so far in this qualifying campaign
[5189.40 - 5192.40] P:1763.51 E:0.064251 |  so important in this particular match
[5192.40 - 5194.40] P:1686.94 E:0.058892 |  to win if they could because you know
[5194.40 - 5197.40] P:1660.48 E:0.065786 |  this is the third of the 5 away games
[5197.40 - 5199.40] P:1776.00 E:0.061939 |  that England will have to play
[5199.40 - 5200.40] P:1736.26 E:0.058727 |  4 out of the 10
[5200.40 - 5202.40] P:1734.05 E:0.075631 |  so they're almost at the half-way stage already
[5202.40 - 5205.40] P:1736.02 E:0.069303 |  big one to come against Ukraine on the 1st of April
[5205.40 - 5207.40] P:1726.84 E:0.066548 |  but this is a very very good scoreline
[5207.40 - 5209.40] P:1523.50 E:0.062133 |  they've had a few wobbly moments
[5209.40 - 5210.40] P:1371.91 E:0.074121 |  but you get those away from home
[5210.40 - 5212.40] P:1706.98 E:0.068083 |  and the Belarus are a very good side
[5212.40 - 5215.40] P:1588.05 E:0.062625 |  and England are doing well here in the second half
[5215.40 - 5218.40] P:1637.23 E:0.062617 |  and we feel that perhaps Fabio Capello
[5218.40 - 5220.40] P:1786.29 E:0.060818 |  has made the right tactical switches once more
[5220.40 - 5222.40] P:1619.34 E:0.068710 |  identifying one of the main problems
[5223.40 - 5226.40] P:1712.62 E:0.064669 |  and putting Gerard in behind the strikers
[5226.40 - 5228.40] P:1627.53 E:0.055833 |  has really kept Kulchi quite occupied
[5228.40 - 5230.40] P:1668.99 E:0.048739 |  in this second half
[5230.40 - 5232.40] P:1542.82 E:0.066859 |  now the break is on once more
[5232.40 - 5233.40] P:1572.55 E:0.067204 |  and it's bully guard
[5233.40 - 5236.40] P:1776.72 E:0.076215 |  the number 7 slides the ball into the edge of the England area
[5236.40 - 5238.40] P:1659.80 E:0.077635 |  oh England getting in difficulties there with Lampard
[5238.40 - 5239.40] P:1757.68 E:0.070452 |  haven't cleared it yet
[5239.40 - 5241.40] P:1873.07 E:0.071041 |  but Dan goes David James to make the save
[5241.40 - 5243.40] P:1818.36 E:0.067465 |  that was just a little bit carefree in careless
[5243.40 - 5245.40] P:1679.51 E:0.056342 |  that England managed to survive
[5245.40 - 5248.40] P:1731.02 E:0.067137 |  there was a careless pass in the sense that Frank was facing his own goal
[5248.40 - 5251.40] P:1799.68 E:0.060403 |  and passed it square without looking
[5252.40 - 5254.40] P:1720.60 E:0.063634 |  and it was just a minor threat to England
[5254.40 - 5256.40] P:1722.20 E:0.060349 |  but David James collected it quite comfortably
[5256.40 - 5257.40] P:1676.87 E:0.061472 |  ball down field
[5257.40 - 5258.40] P:1954.53 E:0.060771 |  Crouch tries to get it
[5258.40 - 5260.40] P:1818.29 E:0.060079 |  Belarus back inside their own half
[5260.40 - 5262.40] P:1688.25 E:0.068598 |  play the ball into the centre circle
[5262.40 - 5263.40] P:1559.96 E:0.052617 |  nice little touches
[5263.40 - 5265.40] P:1668.38 E:0.072348 |  then they knock it forward looking for Rodionov
[5265.40 - 5267.40] P:1829.33 E:0.071023 |  and the challenge comes in this time from Wayne Bridge
[5267.40 - 5269.40] P:1846.23 E:0.059145 |  and it's gone back to David James
[5269.40 - 5270.40] P:1873.24 E:0.056919 |  David James takes one touch
[5270.40 - 5272.40] P:1817.33 E:0.055579 |  and then clears up to the half wayline
[5272.40 - 5273.40] P:1646.16 E:0.044931 |  3-1 to England
[5273.40 - 5275.40] P:2063.25 E:0.074331 |  should be enough now surely
[5275.40 - 5278.40] P:1644.65 E:0.058141 |  with just over 10 minutes to go in this game
[5278.40 - 5280.40] P:1859.35 E:0.069043 |  which has been very very watchable indeed
[5281.40 - 5283.40] P:1671.70 E:0.075257 |  ball shovel down the Belarus right
[5283.40 - 5284.40] P:1681.44 E:0.060141 |  and they don't keep it in
[5285.40 - 5287.40] P:1690.19 E:0.071829 |  Rooney Graham is very clinical isn't he
[5287.40 - 5289.40] P:1678.67 E:0.062468 |  when he gets an opening in front of goal
[5289.40 - 5290.40] P:1263.01 E:0.065029 |  there's no doubt about that
[5290.40 - 5291.40] P:1138.96 E:0.063554 |  I mean he's played very well
[5291.40 - 5293.40] P:1660.34 E:0.061838 |  the last goal was an excellent goal
[5293.40 - 5295.40] P:1553.02 E:0.065982 |  it was a combination play as well
[5295.40 - 5297.40] P:1591.00 E:0.062704 |  between him and Gerard
[5297.40 - 5299.40] P:1814.38 E:0.073458 |  but you just knew that he was going to score
[5299.40 - 5301.40] P:1683.50 E:0.055538 |  and he picked the part of the net
[5301.40 - 5302.40] P:1712.15 E:0.064023 |  that he wanted to put it in
[5302.40 - 5303.40] P:1509.16 E:0.063983 |  he didn't just whack it
[5303.40 - 5307.40] P:1636.69 E:0.063042 |  he placed it in with a bit of power on the ball
[5307.40 - 5309.40] P:1680.01 E:0.058238 |  but it's been a good performance
[5309.40 - 5310.40] P:1418.30 E:0.065907 |  there's no doubt about it
[5310.40 - 5312.40] P:1671.74 E:0.061362 |  Gerard's move has helped
[5312.40 - 5313.40] P:1654.83 E:0.078523 |  the only thing I would say
[5313.40 - 5314.40] P:1590.70 E:0.063812 |  and I've said it a number of times
[5314.40 - 5315.40] P:1610.80 E:0.057575 |  for Bridge
[5315.40 - 5317.40] P:1754.16 E:0.061089 |  it does leave Bridge with so few options
[5317.40 - 5319.40] P:1677.92 E:0.056947 |  when he gets the ball
[5319.40 - 5321.40] P:1701.83 E:0.057460 |  and I feel some sympathy for him
[5321.40 - 5324.40] P:1729.04 E:0.060461 |  because he's got nothing to play out to at all
[5324.40 - 5326.40] P:1805.58 E:0.059550 |  Belarus won England 3
[5326.40 - 5328.40] P:1498.62 E:0.045745 |  at the moment Rooney
[5328.40 - 5330.40] P:1736.72 E:0.065973 |  it's a bit like in the days when England had
[5330.40 - 5332.40] P:1821.59 E:0.058753 |  the likes of Shearer and his pomp and Linnaker
[5332.40 - 5335.40] P:1601.80 E:0.066945 |  I know when you see Rooney going through
[5335.40 - 5337.40] P:1640.78 E:0.065890 |  you're pretty confident that he's going to put it away
[5337.40 - 5340.40] P:1747.40 E:0.065435 |  and Rooney's now scored 19 times for his country
[5340.40 - 5342.40] P:1723.02 E:0.057548 |  this is his 48th appearance
[5342.40 - 5344.40] P:1871.88 E:0.060146 |  pre-kick given to Belarus
[5344.40 - 5347.40] P:1789.33 E:0.058107 |  but you just feel a little bit of the fight now
[5347.40 - 5350.40] P:1602.35 E:0.067900 |  and the belief I suppose has been out of my mind
[5350.40 - 5351.40] P:1636.42 E:0.066407 |  I mean it's one of those things
[5351.40 - 5353.40] P:1527.21 E:0.074210 |  they didn't really want half time to come
[5353.40 - 5356.40] P:1524.75 E:0.068072 |  when so many managers have said that before
[5356.40 - 5358.40] P:1222.01 E:0.060361 |  but I think they've run out of legs a little bit
[5358.40 - 5360.40] P:1671.53 E:0.065114 |  I don't think they're physically as fit as the England players
[5360.40 - 5362.40] P:1576.24 E:0.075144 |  England was still some defending to do
[5362.40 - 5364.40] P:1590.39 E:0.062903 |  that was a really important header
[5364.40 - 5366.40] P:1758.85 E:0.068003 |  intersection by Brown in the second half
[5366.40 - 5368.40] P:1750.42 E:0.063110 |  when they possibly had their best moment
[5368.40 - 5371.40] P:1683.81 E:0.058598 |  the home team Belarus and Brown too
[5371.40 - 5373.40] P:1848.33 E:0.066740 |  alongside Ferdinand has had a strong game tonight
[5373.40 - 5375.40] P:1636.44 E:0.048776 |  and now he prepares to throw the ball
[5375.40 - 5377.40] P:1368.96 E:0.059068 |  into the Belarus half
[5377.40 - 5379.40] P:1711.71 E:0.052897 |  crouch against the kovsov
[5379.40 - 5382.40] P:1415.78 E:0.053645 |  doesn't always get a lot of the headlines
[5382.40 - 5384.40] P:1645.51 E:0.073494 |  where's Brown but he's had a steady old game tonight
[5384.40 - 5385.40] P:1216.78 E:0.081710 |  at right back
[5385.40 - 5387.40] P:1797.38 E:0.070611 |  well you know I mean he's had his critics as well
[5387.40 - 5389.40] P:1580.97 E:0.061702 |  as in people say this and say that about him
[5389.40 - 5392.40] P:1811.01 E:0.064303 |  but he's come in he's took the right back position
[5392.40 - 5394.40] P:1698.28 E:0.065119 |  he's played centre back obviously this course for
[5394.40 - 5396.40] P:1773.76 E:0.061927 |  the odd occasional matches
[5396.40 - 5398.40] P:1780.39 E:0.077058 |  he's played it right back there
[5398.40 - 5401.40] P:1950.36 E:0.075754 |  and I think Capello doesn't like to change his back for
[5401.40 - 5404.40] P:1950.83 E:0.077420 |  and he's not all that concerned about full back
[5404.40 - 5406.40] P:1994.72 E:0.074469 |  bombing on you know
[5406.40 - 5409.40] P:2024.06 E:0.077479 |  I think he's quite happy to keep a solid back for
[5409.40 - 5411.40] P:1900.55 E:0.078629 |  in this group the last we heard
[5411.40 - 5413.40] P:1967.01 E:0.075715 |  I think it was 4-0 to Croatia against Andorra
[5413.40 - 5415.40] P:1960.75 E:0.070653 |  which is part of the course really
[5415.40 - 5418.40] P:1921.92 E:0.069010 |  Northern Ireland are leading 3-0 against the 10 men
[5418.40 - 5419.40] P:1856.04 E:0.061724 |  of San Marino
[5419.40 - 5421.40] P:1811.23 E:0.061236 |  Republic won up against Cyprus
[5421.40 - 5423.40] P:1838.94 E:0.055143 |  Robbie Keane's goal
[5423.40 - 5426.40] P:1777.98 E:0.055665 |  well what a result that Wales may get
[5426.40 - 5429.40] P:1769.26 E:0.071666 |  Germany nil Wales nil is still the latest score
[5429.40 - 5431.40] P:1624.30 E:0.068544 |  let's hope Wales can hang on
[5431.40 - 5433.40] P:1711.11 E:0.070025 |  I remember they took Russia all the way away from home
[5433.40 - 5435.40] P:1720.58 E:0.068317 |  and then lost to a late goal
[5435.40 - 5437.40] P:1811.81 E:0.067484 |  the ball now with Gareth Barry's had a more assured second half
[5437.40 - 5439.40] P:1838.91 E:0.074424 |  Barry moves the ball on to Gerard
[5439.40 - 5441.40] P:1836.64 E:0.064424 |  Gerard now to bridge in space down the left hand side
[5441.40 - 5442.40] P:1737.73 E:0.070563 |  crouch is calling for it
[5442.40 - 5443.40] P:1780.43 E:0.060043 |  in comes a cross from Bidge
[5443.40 - 5444.40] P:1855.77 E:0.069614 |  aim towards crouch
[5444.40 - 5446.40] P:1767.87 E:0.067135 |  headed away though by Belarus
[5446.40 - 5448.40] P:1666.38 E:0.068579 |  right Philips trying to get back on the end of it again for England
[5448.40 - 5451.40] P:1623.41 E:0.064705 |  and Belarus now look to clear once more
[5452.40 - 5454.40] P:1711.70 E:0.067189 |  good ball as well from Belarus
[5454.40 - 5456.40] P:1754.42 E:0.065108 |  but a poor touch there in midfield
[5456.40 - 5458.40] P:1754.80 E:0.057081 |  from one of their substitutes Strakanovich
[5458.40 - 5460.40] P:1553.31 E:0.066500 |  and England have possession again
[5460.40 - 5463.40] P:1696.02 E:0.064028 |  and Wayne Bridge who's also looked better in this second half
[5463.40 - 5467.40] P:1589.78 E:0.061294 |  but nothing like a 3-1 scoreline as opposed to give you more confidence
[5467.40 - 5469.40] P:1643.99 E:0.053918 |  Brown, Capello pointing
[5469.40 - 5471.40] P:1642.77 E:0.061160 |  Brown on his left foot this time
[5471.40 - 5472.40] P:1842.00 E:0.055321 |  in towards crouch
[5472.40 - 5474.40] P:1869.26 E:0.060537 |  crouch sideways header
[5474.40 - 5476.40] P:1929.59 E:0.070128 |  nice first touch from right Philips
[5476.40 - 5478.40] P:1814.47 E:0.066377 |  away goes Sean Wright's Phillips for England
[5478.40 - 5480.40] P:1964.54 E:0.072551 |  going past a couple of defenders
[5480.40 - 5481.40] P:1603.08 E:0.063699 |  goalkeeper manly
[5481.40 - 5482.40] P:1790.77 E:0.065795 |  oh the whistles gone
[5482.40 - 5484.40] P:1755.26 E:0.064948 |  the goalkeeper saved it anyway
[5484.40 - 5486.40] P:1799.77 E:0.075682 |  the referee's penalized right Philips
[5486.40 - 5488.40] P:1775.42 E:0.059065 |  I think on the edge of the Belarus penalty area
[5488.40 - 5490.40] P:1516.18 E:0.068338 |  yeah still both a good shot by Gerard
[5490.40 - 5493.40] P:1574.61 E:0.064982 |  and a good save because the goalkeeper wasn't aware of it
[5493.40 - 5497.40] P:1678.84 E:0.060493 |  and came across and just got his fingertips to the ball
[5497.40 - 5500.40] P:1679.65 E:0.049057 |  five live Belarus won
[5500.40 - 5502.40] P:1839.31 E:0.066561 |  England three this time next week
[5502.40 - 5505.40] P:1647.57 E:0.064690 |  Tuesday and Wednesday will be back in the Champions League for you
[5505.40 - 5506.40] P:1580.42 E:0.045165 |  remember
[5507.40 - 5511.40] P:1852.09 E:0.058667 |  England have a friendly match in Germany in November
[5511.40 - 5513.40] P:1714.40 E:0.063683 |  they hope to sort something out in February and a friendly
[5513.40 - 5517.40] P:1625.22 E:0.058347 |  but the next big game in this group isn't until the first of April
[5517.40 - 5518.40] P:1629.66 E:0.050975 |  Wayne Bridge of England
[5518.40 - 5520.40] P:1784.62 E:0.068886 |  3-1 they lead one or two of the home fans now
[5520.40 - 5521.40] P:1843.69 E:0.043462 |  starting to leave
[5521.40 - 5525.40] P:1653.52 E:0.067444 |  and it is by the way 10 pass to 11 in the evening here
[5525.40 - 5526.40] P:1787.58 E:0.055698 |  two hours ahead of you
[5526.40 - 5527.40] P:1811.78 E:0.041504 |  Rooney battling
[5527.40 - 5529.40] P:1902.94 E:0.080974 |  farside has to be careful here Rooney
[5529.40 - 5530.40] P:2049.03 E:0.089462 |  there's no need now
[5530.40 - 5533.40] P:1975.39 E:0.066485 |  when everything's going for you in the game
[5533.40 - 5535.40] P:1941.75 E:0.070226 |  to run the risk of getting a yellow card
[5536.40 - 5538.40] P:1855.89 E:0.073545 |  I think it's time to get another update from Germany
[5538.40 - 5539.40] P:1823.96 E:0.071306 |  Wales Conor McNamara
[5539.40 - 5541.40] P:1696.14 E:0.073830 |  still Germany nil Wales nil
[5541.40 - 5545.40] P:2004.13 E:0.072296 |  and Wales giving themselves every chance of springing a surprise result here
[5545.40 - 5548.40] P:1943.18 E:0.064803 |  Gareth Bale looks like a young Ryan gigs down the left wing
[5548.40 - 5549.40] P:2045.89 E:0.063972 |  he's had jinking runs
[5549.40 - 5552.40] P:2073.50 E:0.069021 |  he's caused the Germans to change their right fullback
[5552.40 - 5555.40] P:1973.52 E:0.065647 |  Clemens Fritz has come on to try and keep tabs on him
[5555.40 - 5557.40] P:1946.92 E:0.067823 |  and the Germans just aren't creating enough chances
[5557.40 - 5559.40] P:1989.44 E:0.064955 |  they've got so much possession
[5559.40 - 5562.40] P:2033.37 E:0.069839 |  but Wayne Hennessy has not had to make any difficult saves
[5562.40 - 5563.40] P:2012.94 E:0.080246 |  Germany nil Wales nil
[5564.40 - 5565.40] P:1756.46 E:0.085256 |  thank you very much
[5565.40 - 5568.40] P:1358.97 E:0.066441 |  all the people leaving this stadium are going to miss David Beckham
[5568.40 - 5570.40] P:1704.01 E:0.069883 |  because we think he's coming on in a moment
[5570.40 - 5572.40] P:1499.61 E:0.052416 |  for cap number 107
[5572.40 - 5575.40] P:1609.50 E:0.061369 |  which will put him just one behind Bobby Moore
[5575.40 - 5577.40] P:1516.34 E:0.054737 |  in terms of outfield players
[5577.40 - 5579.40] P:1727.21 E:0.061205 |  they're making mistakes now Belarus
[5579.40 - 5581.40] P:1648.92 E:0.081669 |  so another little cameo role to come
[5581.40 - 5582.40] P:1883.67 E:0.061549 |  maybe for David Beckham
[5582.40 - 5584.40] P:1987.20 E:0.063347 |  just over five minutes to go
[5584.40 - 5586.40] P:1994.71 E:0.069756 |  Belarus won England three
[5586.40 - 5588.40] P:1981.66 E:0.064157 |  Gerard first for England
[5588.40 - 5591.40] P:1865.89 E:0.073879 |  then Sikko with an equaliser for Belarus
[5591.40 - 5593.40] P:1821.30 E:0.074285 |  it's a half time that was certainly concerned
[5593.40 - 5595.40] P:1667.24 E:0.061181 |  amongst the England fans I would think
[5595.40 - 5597.40] P:1677.22 E:0.073894 |  because Belarus had played very very well
[5597.40 - 5599.40] P:1609.53 E:0.069846 |  but out came England in the second half
[5599.40 - 5601.40] P:1541.98 E:0.070222 |  sorted out by Fabio Capello
[5601.40 - 5604.40] P:1493.79 E:0.066244 |  and the second half has belonged to Wayne Rooney
[5604.40 - 5606.40] P:1445.63 E:0.070379 |  who's put away two opportunities
[5606.40 - 5609.40] P:1565.20 E:0.067274 |  the first made for him wonderfully well really by
[5609.40 - 5612.40] P:1656.37 E:0.058348 |  Emil Heskey on his fiftieth appearance for England
[5613.40 - 5615.40] P:1766.12 E:0.071032 |  it's interesting mate what he's saying
[5615.40 - 5617.40] P:1677.76 E:0.082730 |  even now you can see Gerard looking
[5617.40 - 5619.40] P:1450.50 E:0.058308 |  looking for colchi
[5619.40 - 5621.40] P:1688.09 E:0.055095 |  he's looking round for him
[5621.40 - 5623.40] P:1551.71 E:0.071776 |  it's been obvious that he's been brought in there
[5623.40 - 5625.40] P:1635.42 E:0.060554 |  not only to pose a threat himself
[5625.40 - 5629.40] P:1566.16 E:0.055546 |  but to get round colchi whenever the Belarus have the ball
[5629.40 - 5632.40] P:1863.04 E:0.074227 |  long ball downfield from James Rooney trying to get on the end of it
[5632.40 - 5634.40] P:1808.62 E:0.082975 |  headed away all into Gerard's path
[5634.40 - 5636.40] P:1803.55 E:0.077991 |  here comes Stephen Gerard for England
[5636.40 - 5638.40] P:1879.36 E:0.079352 |  round the goalkeeper on his hit the post
[5638.40 - 5640.40] P:1856.13 E:0.061657 |  that should have been four one
[5640.40 - 5643.40] P:1867.06 E:0.074744 |  oh Gerard how on earth did he miss that
[5643.40 - 5646.40] P:1858.09 E:0.072209 |  he's stormed through went round the keeper
[5646.40 - 5649.40] P:1918.03 E:0.073325 |  goal there and somehow Stephen Gerard contrives
[5649.40 - 5651.40] P:1790.53 E:0.073648 |  to miss what would have been his second goal of the night
[5651.40 - 5653.40] P:1933.63 E:0.065431 |  looked an absolute certain scorer
[5653.40 - 5654.40] P:1907.29 E:0.074662 |  should have been a scorer
[5654.40 - 5656.40] P:1822.12 E:0.067190 |  it now should be four one it remains three one
[5656.40 - 5658.40] P:1787.32 E:0.066443 |  well that's the old thing isn't it
[5658.40 - 5660.40] P:1643.98 E:0.065016 |  you know you put the ball in the net
[5660.40 - 5662.40] P:1646.51 E:0.060365 |  mentally and you've not taken care
[5662.40 - 5664.40] P:1735.76 E:0.074697 |  you've done it you know you're going to score
[5664.40 - 5667.40] P:1629.04 E:0.059605 |  and you haven't concentrated on that final touch
[5667.40 - 5670.40] P:1697.76 E:0.057965 |  being better if you'd taken it with his left foot out first
[5670.40 - 5672.40] P:1584.21 E:0.061895 |  I think but he flicked it with the outside his right foot
[5672.40 - 5675.40] P:1761.75 E:0.059498 |  he could see nothing else but him scoring
[5675.40 - 5678.40] P:1601.49 E:0.059087 |  and okay fine but I think the concentration
[5678.40 - 5680.40] P:1708.10 E:0.057750 |  just went at the last second
[5680.40 - 5683.40] P:1637.98 E:0.071825 |  well it would have been another four one score line away from home
[5683.40 - 5686.40] P:1692.48 E:0.066171 |  for England Beckham waiting patiently to come on
[5686.40 - 5688.40] P:1827.37 E:0.069381 |  back to Conor McNamara Germany Wales
[5688.40 - 5692.40] P:1793.56 E:0.079039 |  still Germany nil Wales nil but Wales have had a really good opportunity to score
[5692.40 - 5695.40] P:1857.25 E:0.072856 |  Craig Bellamy coming in forcing a save as a
[5695.40 - 5697.40] P:1899.76 E:0.073995 |  a shot from Swine's Tiger here goes wide
[5697.40 - 5699.40] P:1746.43 E:0.066573 |  what made us a good chance was that when
[5699.40 - 5701.40] P:1987.10 E:0.073653 |  Bellamy's shot was saved by the keeper Adler
[5701.40 - 5704.40] P:1964.50 E:0.069033 |  it spun up into the air and coming in like a train
[5704.40 - 5708.40] P:1920.79 E:0.073578 |  and then coming in to the penalty area Simon Davis was so close to getting in into the back of the net
[5708.40 - 5711.40] P:1936.00 E:0.074317 |  he didn't Germany nil Wales nil
[5711.40 - 5714.40] P:1817.94 E:0.072305 |  thank you England are finding a few gaps at the back now
[5714.40 - 5718.40] P:1853.21 E:0.065445 |  from Belarus Beckham comes on for Rooney who's not going to get a hat trick
[5718.40 - 5722.40] P:1880.00 E:0.070720 |  so Wayne Rooney another one he's not aware he's coming off
[5722.40 - 5725.40] P:1818.76 E:0.071964 |  now he is he shakes the hand of the referee
[5725.40 - 5728.40] P:1714.17 E:0.068992 |  he's had another storming game here he's made all the difference in the second half
[5728.40 - 5731.40] P:1745.12 E:0.072475 |  Beckham's applauding him tell you what it's a good job Graham
[5731.40 - 5734.40] P:1922.29 E:0.069930 |  it's not still one one I mean Gerard missing that one
[5734.40 - 5738.40] P:1841.05 E:0.072243 |  it may not matter too much no he'll have the mickey taken out of him for that miss
[5738.40 - 5741.40] P:1795.93 E:0.072512 |  when you win like that you know he'll be more concerned
[5741.40 - 5744.40] P:1770.85 E:0.071366 |  it says that he'll not like it it will be shown again
[5744.40 - 5747.40] P:1708.31 E:0.083594 |  but not in any way as short because the victory is there
[5747.40 - 5750.40] P:1568.10 E:0.076726 |  in the dressing room there will be a few comments
[5750.40 - 5752.40] P:1401.37 E:0.056484 |  it's called banter
[5752.40 - 5755.40] P:1697.96 E:0.079535 |  and so now all the way from Los Angeles California here in Minsk
[5755.40 - 5759.40] P:1685.97 E:0.063987 |  de Beckham corner kick to England lampard to take it
[5759.40 - 5761.40] P:1708.99 E:0.073516 |  Gerard desperate to get on the end of it
[5761.40 - 5764.40] P:1826.82 E:0.077761 |  header comes in good header as well it was from Matthew Upsen
[5764.40 - 5767.40] P:1783.26 E:0.074729 |  say by the goalkeeper back to Connor McNamara
[5767.40 - 5769.40] P:1801.36 E:0.086558 |  Germany won Wales nil
[5769.40 - 5773.40] P:1943.05 E:0.079650 |  Petr Trogovsky has finally broken the deadlock
[5773.40 - 5777.40] P:1964.01 E:0.075314 |  he turned David Edwards inside out on the edge of the penalty area
[5777.40 - 5779.40] P:1856.90 E:0.082472 |  it was a brilliant individual goal
[5779.40 - 5782.40] P:1848.47 E:0.081258 |  he rifled his shot beyond Wayne Hennessey
[5782.40 - 5787.40] P:1870.16 E:0.077476 |  and poor old Wales having done so well up until the final 18 minutes
[5787.40 - 5791.40] P:1830.26 E:0.076907 |  have finally conceded Germany won Wales nil
[5791.40 - 5796.40] P:1672.69 E:0.067726 |  well what a deep deep frustration that will be for everyone concerned
[5796.40 - 5799.40] P:1857.00 E:0.071365 |  with Wales taking Germany so far in that game
[5799.40 - 5802.40] P:1644.50 E:0.063737 |  Germany done it to many many sides over the years
[5802.40 - 5805.40] P:1688.21 E:0.069929 |  of course late stinging the tail for them
[5805.40 - 5808.40] P:1668.65 E:0.068213 |  we're going to have the younger brother Alexander Klebs younger brother
[5808.40 - 5812.40] P:1799.21 E:0.066870 |  the Akaslav Feb who's going to come on for all of about a minute and a half here
[5812.40 - 5815.40] P:1644.47 E:0.058157 |  in just a second England have the game won
[5815.40 - 5819.40] P:1654.76 E:0.059432 |  it's a very fine result this because if you've been with us from the start
[5819.40 - 5824.40] P:1572.15 E:0.065464 |  you'll know that Belarus technically have wanted to pretty gifted players
[5824.40 - 5827.40] P:1639.32 E:0.071108 |  and they'll be a handful for anybody in this qualifying campaign
[5827.40 - 5830.40] P:1741.56 E:0.062239 |  so this is a good win for England
[5830.40 - 5833.40] P:1754.74 E:0.068717 |  that's what it's all about isn't it just getting those three points
[5833.40 - 5836.40] P:1598.28 E:0.061484 |  12 points from four games wonderful start to the group
[5836.40 - 5839.40] P:1619.90 E:0.072211 |  and a great way to win the year for Fabio Capello
[5839.40 - 5841.40] P:1347.35 E:0.074635 |  and the confidence will grow more and more
[5841.40 - 5843.40] P:1682.16 E:0.072760 |  ball with James in the England goal
[5843.40 - 5845.40] P:1706.00 E:0.060157 |  clears down field crouches there
[5845.40 - 5847.40] P:1739.05 E:0.070318 |  header on to try and find Gerard
[5847.40 - 5849.40] P:1581.39 E:0.063248 |  awkward bubble for the defender
[5849.40 - 5851.40] P:1672.67 E:0.067133 |  and because of that he's put it out of play
[5851.40 - 5854.40] P:1712.79 E:0.062600 |  and here comes the final change now with the Akaslav Kleb
[5854.40 - 5858.40] P:1814.50 E:0.061494 |  coming on to a man who's well had a great first half
[5858.40 - 5861.40] P:1699.06 E:0.062528 |  Stas Javitsch of Baty Borisov
[5861.40 - 5864.40] P:1582.72 E:0.062953 |  haven't seen as much of him in the second half
[5864.40 - 5867.40] P:1415.04 E:0.075479 |  and they as Graham Taylor intimated really in the end
[5867.40 - 5871.40] P:1360.63 E:0.066159 |  they have looked much more weary during the second half
[5871.40 - 5873.40] P:1583.36 E:0.059927 |  and he's not very tired
[5873.40 - 5875.40] P:1623.41 E:0.084472 |  and you saw that as he came off you know
[5875.40 - 5878.40] P:1704.15 E:0.067070 |  struggling to almost get off the pitch
[5878.40 - 5880.40] P:1646.06 E:0.072495 |  back to Belfast Ian Dennis
[5880.40 - 5882.40] P:1919.35 E:0.076589 |  it's fourth on Northern Ireland against San Marino
[5882.40 - 5885.40] P:1896.99 E:0.079766 |  the busy Steve Davis with a delightful flick
[5885.40 - 5887.40] P:1622.03 E:0.078572 |  latching on to Lapartis low cross
[5887.40 - 5889.40] P:1622.69 E:0.071738 |  Northern Ireland four San Marino nil
[5889.40 - 5891.40] P:1876.49 E:0.072278 |  thank you very much right Philips by the way
[5891.40 - 5893.40] P:1616.86 E:0.058803 |  has gone across to the left hand side
[5893.40 - 5895.40] P:1713.22 E:0.066042 |  four minutes of added time here
[5895.40 - 5897.40] P:1832.83 E:0.069330 |  we're going to be playing
[5897.40 - 5899.40] P:1785.28 E:0.067626 |  Beckham obviously playing down the right
[5899.40 - 5901.40] P:1755.42 E:0.065230 |  and he's got a good play line
[5901.40 - 5903.40] P:1455.31 E:0.058076 |  typical lampart shuffle on to Beckham
[5903.40 - 5905.40] P:1666.80 E:0.043769 |  Beckham holds it gives it back to Brown
[5905.40 - 5907.40] P:1539.49 E:0.075818 |  England three one lead bridge has the ball
[5907.40 - 5909.40] P:1469.97 E:0.070965 |  over on the far side the field
[5909.40 - 5912.40] P:1454.04 E:0.058979 |  bridge gets away from the defender easily
[5912.40 - 5914.40] P:1809.86 E:0.065957 |  bridge on to right Philips
[5914.40 - 5917.40] P:1651.70 E:0.067791 |  right Philips and bridge together down that left hand side the field
[5917.40 - 5919.40] P:1652.88 E:0.065205 |  the tackles go flying in from the home team
[5919.40 - 5922.40] P:1593.18 E:0.069923 |  England don't mind now that it's just a bit untidy
[5922.40 - 5924.40] P:1542.15 E:0.062923 |  over on the far side they are denying
[5924.40 - 5927.40] P:1772.76 E:0.075906 |  Belarus possession Belarus are not crossing the half way line
[5927.40 - 5929.40] P:1541.77 E:0.063784 |  runes gone off having scored the two goals
[5929.40 - 5932.40] P:1843.81 E:0.073607 |  Gerard should also scored two goals tonight
[5932.40 - 5934.40] P:1519.82 E:0.063465 |  only he knows really how he missed the fourth
[5934.40 - 5937.40] P:1613.98 E:0.062220 |  but it really isn't going to make a great deal of difference
[5937.40 - 5940.40] P:1712.89 E:0.047035 |  Brown of England to Beckham
[5940.40 - 5942.40] P:1792.05 E:0.056878 |  hugging the touch line near side
[5942.40 - 5944.40] P:1537.45 E:0.069108 |  Beckham made the run down the line but Brown doesn't return it to him
[5944.40 - 5946.40] P:1724.96 E:0.055556 |  instead it's gone to Gareth Barry much more
[5946.40 - 5949.40] P:1682.38 E:0.070065 |  steady in the second half and that's a lovely ball now from
[5949.40 - 5951.40] P:1768.47 E:0.076210 |  lampart of Gerard Gerard to release Beckham
[5951.40 - 5954.40] P:1762.82 E:0.072179 |  only crouch in the area Beckham to pull this one back to the far post
[5955.40 - 5958.40] P:1826.54 E:0.070054 |  just away from crouch diving header so a corner kick for England
[5958.40 - 5961.40] P:1819.95 E:0.065596 |  over on the far side the left and Beckham is already making his way over there
[5961.40 - 5964.40] P:1692.20 E:0.071068 |  I have to say looking at David Beckham chasing that ball
[5964.40 - 5967.40] P:1536.90 E:0.070684 |  I thought you ain't going to make it David the legs aren't going to get you there
[5967.40 - 5971.40] P:1693.27 E:0.068078 |  they did just in time he got the ball up in the air
[5971.40 - 5975.40] P:1796.23 E:0.071935 |  but unfortunately for Peter Crouch it's just a little bit too high
[5975.40 - 5978.40] P:1876.71 E:0.066445 |  there are Belarus fans clapping and applauding David Beckham
[5978.40 - 5981.40] P:1823.28 E:0.067799 |  as he goes across to the far side
[5982.40 - 5984.40] P:1795.24 E:0.067416 |  great ambassador for English football
[5984.40 - 5987.40] P:1711.73 E:0.060667 |  Beckham short corner back to Barry on the edge of the area
[5987.40 - 5990.40] P:1704.83 E:0.069641 |  it's back again with Beckham and England just retain the ball
[5990.40 - 5992.40] P:1655.55 E:0.058047 |  Gareth Barry England leading 3-1
[5992.40 - 5994.40] P:1614.95 E:0.059004 |  Barry to Beckham on the left
[5994.40 - 5997.40] P:1768.09 E:0.066515 |  in comes a cross and the goalkeeper just about gather that one in
[5997.40 - 6000.40] P:1773.59 E:0.052418 |  and preparing to clear
[6000.40 - 6004.40] P:1791.48 E:0.069377 |  but it's all over now here the Belarus who gave absolutely everything
[6004.40 - 6008.40] P:1610.28 E:0.059654 |  before the break spectacular equaliser as Alan was saying
[6008.40 - 6011.40] P:1567.99 E:0.063745 |  apparently 23 passes in the move
[6011.40 - 6014.40] P:1567.06 E:0.057265 |  which led to the headed equaliser from Sitko
[6014.40 - 6017.40] P:1671.50 E:0.051729 |  Belarus just playing out time
[6017.40 - 6020.40] P:1654.60 E:0.068913 |  we're playing out time here 4 minutes of added time
[6020.40 - 6023.40] P:1637.19 E:0.060502 |  but we've already played 2 minutes of the added time
[6023.40 - 6026.40] P:1560.86 E:0.066837 |  another very efficient night for Fabio Capello
[6026.40 - 6030.40] P:1650.20 E:0.068517 |  only he knows in the team at the moment exactly the extent of the
[6030.40 - 6034.40] P:1722.64 E:0.057297 |  halftime discussion in the dressing room
[6034.40 - 6037.40] P:1677.79 E:0.066984 |  but certainly putting Gerard in to disrupt Kulchi
[6037.40 - 6040.40] P:1515.53 E:0.061884 |  it's a major factor in this second half
[6040.40 - 6042.40] P:1635.88 E:0.078377 |  Belarus over on the left bridge is just
[6042.40 - 6045.40] P:1683.91 E:0.063324 |  he's not out of position that was well played by bridge
[6045.40 - 6047.40] P:1839.16 E:0.060069 |  good swift back pass to goalkeeper James
[6047.40 - 6049.40] P:1633.23 E:0.062235 |  and it's back towards the half way line once more
[6049.40 - 6051.40] P:1662.98 E:0.056419 |  a touch from crotch lampards available
[6051.40 - 6053.40] P:1682.24 E:0.058913 |  right Phillips has now come across to the right
[6053.40 - 6055.40] P:1699.34 E:0.067006 |  Beckham has stayed over on the left hand side
[6055.40 - 6060.40] P:1618.05 E:0.061490 |  it's right Phillips now taking on 3 or 4 Belarus players
[6060.40 - 6063.40] P:1630.90 E:0.071159 |  and then goes down very easily looking for a free kick
[6063.40 - 6065.40] P:1426.55 E:0.038152 |  and it's not given
[6065.40 - 6067.40] P:1674.11 E:0.073489 |  I can see that Greeny smirking here
[6067.40 - 6069.40] P:1460.17 E:0.078611 |  is he suggesting Beckham can't make it back up
[6069.40 - 6073.40] P:1529.71 E:0.071741 |  we were thinking that the run that he had to keep the ball in
[6073.40 - 6077.40] P:1561.47 E:0.069254 |  and then the corner he had to go across to the other side as well
[6077.40 - 6079.40] P:1718.24 E:0.071724 |  I would put money on Beckham to beat Alan Green
[6079.40 - 6081.40] P:1687.75 E:0.060556 |  and he kind of sprint there
[6081.40 - 6083.40] P:1688.15 E:0.059810 |  wouldn't you?
[6083.40 - 6085.40] P:1912.24 E:0.068061 |  certainly
[6085.40 - 6087.40] P:1984.25 E:0.063914 |  Belarus building from the back
[6087.40 - 6090.40] P:1984.87 E:0.081667 |  and we've got seconds to go here in Minsk
[6090.40 - 6093.40] P:1964.10 E:0.075492 |  which is a difficult place to come and play and win matches
[6093.40 - 6096.40] P:1921.88 E:0.072565 |  Holland didn't do it in the last qualifying campaign
[6096.40 - 6098.40] P:1919.85 E:0.062272 |  but England have the points
[6098.40 - 6099.40] P:1766.83 E:0.076250 |  Crouch has the ball
[6099.40 - 6101.40] P:1855.50 E:0.069009 |  Lampard knocks it forward
[6101.40 - 6103.40] P:1866.31 E:0.066212 |  and Gerard's just straight offside
[6103.40 - 6105.40] P:1859.41 E:0.064838 |  referee looks at his watch for the first time
[6105.40 - 6108.40] P:1813.64 E:0.076406 |  the Norwegian official hasn't really been troubled in this game
[6108.40 - 6112.40] P:1623.45 E:0.065422 |  hasn't had to get involved in any kind of controversy at all
[6112.40 - 6116.40] P:1658.73 E:0.065641 |  David James got a yellow card for belting the ball away after
[6116.40 - 6118.40] P:1580.33 E:0.070389 |  Belarus got their equaliser
[6118.40 - 6121.40] P:1640.64 E:0.061497 |  the ball is to the far side of the field
[6121.40 - 6123.40] P:1683.64 E:0.080975 |  again the referee looks at his watch
[6123.40 - 6126.40] P:1545.39 E:0.063112 |  we've got I think 10 seconds of added time to play
[6126.40 - 6129.40] P:1686.72 E:0.069887 |  England having beaten Andorra as you'd expect
[6129.40 - 6132.40] P:1685.87 E:0.063143 |  having wonderfully won in Croatia
[6132.40 - 6136.40] P:1823.33 E:0.068994 |  then destroying Kazakhstan in the second half on Saturday
[6136.40 - 6139.40] P:1760.65 E:0.074726 |  and this is another terrific result for Fabio Capello
[6139.40 - 6140.40] P:1665.62 E:0.076164 |  here in Minsk
[6140.40 - 6143.40] P:1588.87 E:0.082225 |  two goals from Wayne Rooney the key to it all in the second half
[6143.40 - 6145.40] P:1466.46 E:0.070762 |  after quite an awkward first half
[6145.40 - 6147.40] P:1727.86 E:0.063669 |  when it was won all at halftime
[6147.40 - 6149.40] P:1750.29 E:0.081229 |  in the end England showing their qualities
[6149.40 - 6152.40] P:1725.21 E:0.066215 |  have won this game by three goals to one
