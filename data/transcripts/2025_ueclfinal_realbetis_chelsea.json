  "transcript": " of the UEFA Conference League winners so far, Roma in 2022, West Ham famously in Prague. We were there for that in 2023 and Olympiakos in 2024. Tonight Chelsea could become the first club in men's football to win all four of UEFA's major knockout competitions. The Betis fans have those green and white scarves held high. The Chelsea players all in blue, white socks pulled high, break away from the team huddle and this is the Chelsea team for tonight named by Enzo Moresca. Philip Jorgensen the dain in goal all in black, away to our right at Ports, the Chelsea fans behind him. Malogusto is in at right back, Rhys James is named amongst the substitutes, Mark Cucarera at left back, Trevor Chalabar and Benoit Badiasil the two sender backs. Cole Palmer relish in the occasion with the ball at his feet on the centre spot. Four or five keep the ups, picks it up and then places it down very precisely right in the middle of the pitch. Captain Enzo Fernandez alongside Moises Caesado in central midfield, Noni Madaway, K.A. Pedro Neto on the flanks and Cole Palmer in behind Nicholas Jackson. We are underway, five live BBC sounds and a very warm welcome to all our listeners on BBC Radio London this evening as well. Early challenge from Chalabar just outside the Chelsea penalty area and an important one as well on Abday who was trying to race onto a through ball there. Chalabar made the sliding tackle. I think Abday as he ran past him caught him with one of his boots in the head. Yeah, it's a fantastic challenge by Trevor Chalabay, full stretch, slides down is actually his knee that collides with Trevor Chalabar in his face. It seems to be OK, but it was a pretty big hit. Mark Schwartzer having played in two major European finals as we've been discussing Middlesbrough 2006, Fulham in 2010. Both of those against Spanish opposition in the stadium with us tonight. Pedro Neto scurrying away down the right just ran out of space. The ball has gone out for an early throw to rail. Betters they are defending the goal away to our left hand side and it is their very experienced centre back, Mark Bartra, who passes the ball to his right to Yusuf Sabali. Back here to Natan, the Brazilian online from Napoli. Goalkeeper under pressure from Nicholas Jackson. Jackson barges into Adrian and down he goes and the referee decides to give that as a free kick. But an early moment there for the former West Ham and Liverpool. Goalkeeper, Adrian, all in yellow, starting for Real Betters tonight. So Adrian in goal, Sabali, Bartra, Natan and Ricardo Rodriguez there back four. Pablo Fournals, Johnny Cardoso, the American international and Isco as a midfield three. The danger from the Flanks comes from Antony yet to touch the ball in the final and Abdei and Cedric Bacambu, international footballer for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Much-travelled footballer as well, starting as the centre forward for Real Betters who are now in control of the ball inside their own half, back into their own penalty area to Adrian. Side put to pass here to Bartra. Jackson again in very quickly for Chelsea, makes the tackle and actually Chelsea get the throw. Yeah, I tell you what, the bitters have been very, very slow playing the ball around the back. Adrian in particular has really taken his time. He got away with the one with Jackson's thumb begins. Yeah, probably was just a foul but he held the ball for such a long period of time, almost got caught out and just now again, he's touched and then delivery or pass was so slow and actually short. Chelsea playing left to right in the first half. Enzo Fernandez tackled through ball looking for Bacambu, goes past him, he won't get to that in time. Philip Jorgensen out to the edge of his penalty area. The Chelsea goalkeeper who has started 13 of the 14 games in the competition so far, so make that 14 out of 15, 23 years old, first season at the club having joined from Villareal. He passes the ball out here and then Gusto nearly loses it on the edge of the penalty area. A couple of loose touches back to Jorgensen, then you get the cheers and the whistles and the bet his fans float to pass out to the right hand side. Chalabar tries to play it forward, he's barged over and this time our referee who's from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Irfan Pelto, refereeing his first European final, 40 years old, took charge of Arsenal against Real Madrid earlier this season in the Champions League quarter finals. So got a close up view of those two brilliant free kicks from Declan Rice, he's in charge tonight, Chelsea have taken their free kick and Chalabar plays it back here to Jorgensen again. So no great drama in the first four minutes of the game, five live BBC sounds of BBC Radio London tonight to the UEFA Conference League final. Madiwaki first touch, clever one with his head, and what's it back to Fernandez inside the Chelsea half. Caisseto went to be quick to cover the ground there, controls the ball well, plays back to Chalabar and across it comes the netto. I don't think Col Parma's had a touch yet, here he comes, moves close to netto, wide on the right for Chelsea, just inside the bet his half. A couple of touches just trying to draw the can move towards him, then he passes the ball away, badia shield forward to Gusto, Caisseto's first time ball, flick from Jackson looking for Parma. And then he doesn't come off and suddenly Abdey is away down the left hand side for Betis, bit of space to work with, takes on Caisseto on the outside, down to the byline he goes, Caisseto makes a half block and the header from Anthony, his first touch of the game, can't control it, looks well up over the bar and goes behind for a goal kick to Chelsea. Yeah, Malagusta there took a big big gamble, he tries to win the ball before it gets to Abdey and he doesn't get there and Abdey just turns and runs into space, he's the one that runs on the left hand side, just outside the out, out in the out box to the byline, gets that cross in and Anthony's the one that springs very, very high, just can't control the header and it goes quite wide past the goal in the end. So danger averted from Chelsea, Malagusta just has to be careful not to get drawn out of position too easily. Real Betis, Niel, Chelsea, Niel, early stages of the final, ball played by Chalabar up towards netto, pressure on him but support from Parma, he goes striding away, ball at his feet down the right, cuts back in field onto his left foot, little trick, beats his man in the area, low shot towards the near post, Adrian's in the right position and he makes the block who they're talking about, the Chelsea owners whether they were in attendance for the final tonight here in Poland, Chelsea concede a free kick on the edge of the Betis penalty area, indeed they are, Todd Boli and Bidad Egbali, both here inside the stadium tonight, sat next to Alexander Ceperin and in terms of the T-Fo display from the Real Betis fans before the game, I was right, it wasn't meant to be Manuela Greeny, St Ferdinand is the patron saint of Seville, also known as San Fernando, that was the man we saw, big and bold away to our left, attacking from Betis, here's Isko, left foot across into the near post, Jorgensen does well, called for that and took it on the half volley at his near post, good vision as well, doles it out under onto his captain Enzo Fernandez, he comes striding forward and plays a pass to his left to Jackson, Jackson running with the ball at his feet, cuts in from the left wing, back to Fernandez, Betis standing off for the moment, Chelsea in a good attacking position, here's Maduaki, takes on Sabali, pokes the ball past him, Sabali slides in, still in play there, little nudge from Jackson as Barca tried to clear the referee's spot at that and he's given another free kick to Real Betis and I wonder where the mark, that's why Enzo Fernandez has come in there, three or four decisions, first five, six minutes of this game have gone against Chelsea in terms of those challenges, little nudges and barges in 50-50s. Yeah, Chelsea's been a little bit physical, but they've won the ball a couple of times, they've won some more Catares, he wins the ball and then there's a coming together and the referee goes against him, he gets the first touch and then that's why there's a bit of frustration, Enzo Fernandez there going to the referee, letting him know he's not happy so far with the way that the referee's given Betis a lot of the 50-50 calls at the moment. Paul is backward, Phillip Jorgensen, Chelsea's young goalkeeper, holds the ball, in his white glove on his right hand, drops it, throwing the white boots to match and then drills it low and left towards Madawayki, the ball comes skidding across the pitch, Madawayki controls, goes back to Kukereya, loose pass out from the back by Badia Shil, Fernandez has to try and win a couple of 50-50s, he does that, then another one, Fernandez on the ball for Chelsea, passes across here to Parma, he's chased by Abdey, quickly wicks the ball out to the right and Netto's got a chance to pick up pace and moving quickly in field, now surely no, not caught there, jumped over the challenge, in midfield from Cardoso, went down, no free kick given, his for Kanbu, backpedaling, trying to control the ball inside the Chelsea half, he's then tabled by Gusto and Chelsea could build again. Yeah, very strange decision for the referee there, Netto does so so well, darts inside as he drops the shoulder in, comes back inside the pitch and I'm sure he gets a touch on him, as he knocks the ball past the defender, the defender gets a timing roll, the referee's right there, he just doesn't give it. It's one of those, Mark, even if he wasn't caught he had to leap out of the way not to be caught there by Johnny Cardoso, he looked like there was contact, Chelsea have given the ball away, Isco clever pass into the penalty, Abdey shoots and finds the bottom corner, for Rael Betis in their first major European final, the substitutes can't control themselves, they're on the field and celebrating, but Chelsea show Betis space at the back and water finish from Abdey, fires it into the bottom corner and Chelsea behind, early on in Poland, Rael Betis won, Chelsea nil. Yeah, brutal, absolutely brutal, ruthless from Betis, Abdey's fantastic finish, takes a touch, touch and rifles it into that bottom right hand corner, gives the goalkeeper no chance whatsoever, and it all comes about because Chelsea, they're in good possession, they try and play as Gustav Mahler this time, he tries to play the ball from midfield, he's tight inside, tries to play it across the left hand side, gets easily cut out and there's a really good pass from Anthony across, drops the shoulder, plays across, Abdey takes it from his right onto his left and then rifles it across the goalkeeper into the bottom corner, brilliant finish. Genius from Isco with the pass as Mark suggests, Chelsea gave him the chance, he had the ball on the edge of the penalty area, whole sea of blue shirts around him, but at the corner of his left eye, he saw the run from Abdey, disguise on the pass, 90 degrees to his left hand side, Abdey took a touch and fits the finish, pass for Lydde-Yorgansson. That's the quality of Isco isn't it, he's got the ability, he sees everything in front of him, it's a pass that most people probably wouldn't have even seen, and he's got his head down, and he drops the shoulder, he just plays the ball straight to Abdey, Abdey takes a great touch and then the finish is equally good. Well Mark talks about it in the build up to the game, Spanish teams against English teams in European finals in men's football, they have won the last nine, the last English team to beat a Spanish team in a European final, Liverpool in the UEFA cup as was back in 2001 against Alves, Gusto is there, hacks the ball away with his left foot, he was at fault for that bet his goal, loose with possession inside the Chelsea half, Fernandez under pressure for Chelsea in front of his own penalty area, he's fouled, Cardoso steps in and sort of subtly kicks the ball away, Caesado didn't like it, shoves Cardoso and the referee steps in just to have a word with Moises Caesado. Yeah see I think that's poor referee, Chelsea trying to play a quick free kick, Cardoso comes across and he just toe pokes the ball away, he kicks the ball away, he's time wasting, the referee's right there, he's got to give me a little guard, instead he just has a word with him and obviously they slow the play down, Bidders are over the regroup, got players behind the ball and Chelsea have to take their time now. Well if Chelsea didn't know they were in for a game tonight in this final they certainly do now, Real Betis have bounced at the stadium away to our left, that's actually making me feel slightly queasy watching it bounce up and down, green and white everywhere, just a sea of arms, short sleeves, green and white shirts, everyone clapping above their heads and then those green and white flags, the big white cross in the middle of the green rectangle being waved furiously, Real Betis won, Chelsea 0, Col Palmer on the move for Chelsea with that long loping stride, feeds the pass to Netto, Palmer drops deep, Gustav makes a run beyond Netto, Netto can't find him when the ball goes away for a Real Betis goal kick, coming up to 12 minutes played in the first half here in Stadeon Grossois, Real Betis won, Chelsea near them, there we get our first close-up shot at the craggy face of Manuel Pellegrini, 71 years old, his team in front. Yeah I mean Chelsea just have to settle down a little bit, obviously they feel a bit in shock from conceding that goal, come against a run of play, it's their own mistake that leads to it. Could be another one here, Abdey's onto a loose ball inside the Chelsea half, Gustav is back to try and make the tackle, Abdey just about keeps his feet, turns, plays it to Isco, dark hair with the bid, cross comes in from Abdey on the left, bounces in front of Jorgensen and he gathers that cleanly at his near post. Yeah I think in the end it was good defending there, I think it's Trevor Chaloveo gets a bit of flexion, just deflects straight in the park for Jorgensen, you know Chelsea just too sloppy at times, giving away easy simple passes, balls have been intercepted into midfield, another one this time from Coseido, a silly straight, relatively straight ball in the midfield, so many betters players around, they're just waiting for it, they're straps everywhere. The cambo plays it to the edge of the box, a barter and Jorgensen's forced into a save, flying high to his right hand side, fabulous strike with the right foot, Chelsea very nearly, two nil down, that was the centre back striding forward, caught it sweetly, curling towards the top corner and Jorgensen does really well for Chelsea. Yeah it's a brilliant save from Jorgensen, I tell you what he almost gets caught out because it's a game, quick turnover possession, betters are really quick, really direct, ball played square to Bargeron, he just hits it first time. Corner taken short to Anthony on the edge of the penalty area, feeds it back here to Isco, chips it up in the air and the ball is ambitious from Savali with the left foot and it is well off target, Real Betis won, Chelsea nil, Chelsea goal kick, 14 minutes into the first half, bit of a storm threatening before the game, we had dark clouds above, we had a bit of light grain, into the rainbow in the sky as well, but no rain in the air right now, fairly mild night in south west Poland here and a great noise being made still by the fans of the Spanish team away to our left, they've left Colt Palmer in a bit of space, wide on the right inside the Chelsea half, he's in the bright orange boots this evening, not played too much conference league football for Chelsea this season, but here he is in the final, ball is played forward now to Jackson, Chelsea have options here, Jackson goes to his left to Madiwake, Madiwake dribbles into the penalty area, past Bartra, runs into another challenge knocked over, then Quesado, gathers the loose ball, hits the shot, that is blocked, Isco picks it up on the turn, Paddy Ashiling quickly with the challenge, tries to win it again and once again Chelsea penalised for a foul, that's going to be a real better free kick. Yeah, he gives a hand ball on this occasion, I mean his better shills challenge is actually a really good one against Isco, he does really well as he gets up, I think the ball, yeah that's right, the ball gets hit, I mean I don't think that's a hand ball, his hand is right next to him, he's getting up off the ground and the ball gets smashed at him from about five yards out, the referee is really quick to give Bedneson another free kick. Eighth European final for Chelsea in the knockout competitions, they've won six out of seven, fabulous record they have in the European finals, the only defeat against Manchester United in that Champions League final in Moscow back in 2008, they're behind tonight though, Bednes in the green and white stripes, green numbers on the back, play back to their goalkeeper, Adrienne, left footing pass from him out to Bartra, Bartra to Sibali, Sibali plays into the big field to four now, he threads one through, Bacambu tries an ambitious back heel, first time ball intercepted, Chelsea get it forward quickly to Madiouake, in field then to Qaisado, little bit of skill from Fernandez, closed down by Isco, Qaisado's there in support, outside of his right foot, not enough on that, showed too much of it to Sibali who got there ahead of Madiouake, Betis had given the ball away, Madiouake is tackled again, lovely feet from Isco in a tight space, crosses the halfway line, again disguise on the pass into Cardoso and Betis moving quickly to the left hand side, so Abdei the goal scorer, he's been the bigger threat on the left hand side, Antoni's not really been involved in the game so far, he's hanging out wide right, Betis play the ball back to their own hand. Yeah all the attack for Bednes has been on the left hand side and it's really been difficult for Chelsea at the moment, mostly because of their own mistakes, I mean Mala Gusto obviously was the one that was a mistake for him that led to the goal in the first place and there's been a couple of stray passes, Chelsea just need to settle down a little bit, trying to rush things. Jackson trying to get away from Batra, this time Real Betis disappointed with a refereeing decision, Batra in on Jackson, Jackson just too quick for him on the turn, Batra's claiming he got a little toe on the ball there, caught Jackson as well, free kick for Chelsea. I think he may have, I think he may have got a touch on the ball again and for him unlucky and unfortunate for Betis that goes against him. You'll hear more from Pat Nevin on the show tonight, all the reaction as well, two tonight's football and the football daily podcast on the BBC Sounds app tomorrow, Chelsea trailing 1-0, nice pass from Cole Palmer down the inside left channel for Jackson, collect, turns, plays it back to Gusto, edge of the Betis area, forward to Neto back to Palmer, has to scurry back to collect possession again for Chelsea, 40 yards out, goes with a square ball across to Kukere, Betis have everyone behind the ball and here's Palmer again, 10 yards inside the Betis half, sees Neto in a bit of space on the right, chance to bring the ball forward to the edge of the penalty area, there's Palmer back to Neto again, thinks about a cross with the left foot, Palmer noses off side there, runs back into an onside position, then makes a dart down the right, glides past Rodriguez into the penalty area, challenged by Abdei, tries to get it back to Neto, Neto does well to win the ball and a hefty challenge there but he's got to turn away from goal over on that right hand touch line and Chelsea recycle with Gusto across to Quesado, central position now, 35 yards from goal, scoop past the Neto, leaps in the air athletically, brings it down on his chest, Betis fans over there felt the ball had gone out of play, the assistant referee was right there, didn't raise the flag, his baddest shield, his chip pass, spins in the air, pulls at the feet of Madaway King, Fernandez makes a little run down the left, he plays back to Kukere, air swaying as always, he runs with the ball, cross it comes to Chalabar, now to Gusto, got a Chelsea possession here, wide again to Neto, Neto looking for the option to Palmer, makes the little burst down the right, Neto plays back again to Chalabar, he thinks it's opened up on the left, doesn't get the pass right, Sabali to Anthony, Anthony's looking for the one two, Betis shield's got to be quick to cover the ground here, gets a touch ahead of Anthony, runs back to that ball inside his own half and plays back to Philip Jorgensen, yeah it's good to friendly for Betis shield, he comes across, times it perfectly, doesn't dive in, gets his foot in, ahead of Anthony, wins the possession and still because he stays his feet, he's able to regain the ball, Quesado looking for the longer ball over the top, Neto and the Brazilians center back, back pedaling, wins the header, it's tucked away by Bartra from a Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund defender back in his second spell with Rael Betis now, here's Palmer moves the ball quickly on to Neto, Neto up against Ricardo Rodriguez, left-footed cross in towards the far post, headed up in the air by Sabali, bounces inside the box on the right, Madawayke is there for Chelsea, headband, wrapped around his forehead, Quesado with the peroxide, shortly shaven here, Chalabar wide to Neto, Palmer takes it on the turn, again silky skills edge of the box, there's a man with silky skills though knew what Palmer was doing, it was Isco, stepped in, won the ball, floats a delicious pass down the right to Anthony, buddy of shields stooped to try and headed away, Anthony just beaten to it, infield it comes to the can boom, Muresca looking a little concerned here as Chelsea get back, now they do and Isco's there on the halfway line and he's not always in the game every second of the game Isco but the touches when he gets on the ball and Adde's on the ball, for Rael Betis, darts inside, lays it back Cardoso misses from 12 yards out, side-footed it wide, glorious chance for Betis to go tune it up in the final. Ah huge chance, absolutely huge chance, it comes from that right-hand side again, Malagusto loses the ball, just can't get to it as the ball pops up as initially you can see Adde's got the ball, comes inside, takes a really heavy touch, Malagusto lunges across to try and win that ball, misses it and it just falls to Adde and he plays it square and that's that shot, it just gets it, I think it's a deflection isn't it, on the way through over the crossbar, so in the end it's last six defending that prevents Chelsea from going 2-0 down. Yeah I thought Cardoso had sliced it wide, buddy of shield got close enough to get a block on the shot, it's gone behind for a corner, Isco delivers headed away by Chelsea, it falls to Sibali here, the Betis right back, comes wide to Isco, passes through the legs of Jackson, Sibali continues to run, then can't keep his feet and the flag goes up, I think for an offside, anyway pre-kick Chelsea in the left back position, the point I was trying to make there Mark was Isco, you know popped up on the edge of his own penalty area, saw the danger of Palmer nipped into the ball off him, then he pops up inside his own half just saw the half way line, it's just the little touches and passes and this guy, he is a genius. Yeah I mean the quality on the ball, every every involvement he has has a big influence on what Betis do, whether it's going forward, whether it's defending like you mentioned there, that last sort of intervention on Cole Palmer, popping up from nowhere to the pass that leads to the goal, everything that happens, the free kicks of the corners, he is the man that's in the middle of it, the heart of it, he's the one delivering it all. Ball is with Chelsea's goalkeeper, Philip Jorgensen, five-lie, BBC Sound, BBC Radio London tonight, live from Brotswaw in Poland, Chelsea have got a game on their hands, Real Betis lead 1-0, Abdey's goal in the ninth minute, Jorgensen's had to make a flying save from the barter shot that was heading for the top corner, and Badi Ashile with the block on the Cardoso effort as well. Gusto just outside his own box, high ball locked towards Palmer, over Palmer's head, headed away by Ricardo Rodriguez, Abdey lays it back to Cardoso, back in his feet from the American international, pass out to the left, Cardoso continues to run, Abdey was caught by Gusto and that is another free kick for Real Betis. Yeah it's not been the game for Malagusta so far, like he just needs to breathe a little bit, he needs to take his foot off the pedal in a little bit, he's trying to, you know, sometimes you chase the game, it's just dive, didn't he, doesn't need to dive in, I mean it's nothing major, but it's just a little niggly foul again, and that's off the back of giving the ball away a couple of times already. Abdey, who scored in both legs of the semi-final against Fiorentina as did Anthony, didn't start the second leg away to Fiorentina, which actually finished 2-2 after extra time and took Betis through 4-3 on aggregate, but tonight has started and has made a real impact, he scored the goal. Here is Anthony, still on loan from Manchester United, playing for Betis here, had a massive impact on the team since arriving, the ball is back with the Real Betis goalkeeper, Adria, 38 years old now, Natan, shitball down the inside left channel, Abdey jumps, can't keep it for Betis, Quesado holding off Abdey, under pressure from Isco as well, foul by Abdey, free kick Chelsea just short of the halfway line, coming into 25 minutes played in the first half, next football for you commentary-wise is Friday night, women's UEFA Nations League action, England play Portugal at Wembley, last two group games for them, they're away to Spain on Tuesday, they start Friday night, two points behind Spain in the group, all about preparations for the Euros this summer as well, Wales at the tournament in England's group, commentary on their game against Denmark in the Nations League on Friday night, sports extra three at 6.15, here's Mattauakie, facing his own goal deep inside his own heart, back to Badia Shield, good pace on the pass to Gusto, Isco comes racing back to make the challenge, fouls him, Gusto takes the free kick quickly, nearly lost the ball there and gave it away, Kukerea retrieves possession for Chelsea, here's Badia Shield, Gusto again, not a good ball, Betis have won it inside the Chelsea half, spaces to the left, Bornau finds Isco, drops a shoulder, just rolls the ball to his left to Abdey, low cross into the box, miscue by Chalabar, falls to Kukerea, has time to think about the clearance here and it's going to use the speed of Jackson running away down the middle, Jackson up against two Betis defenders, he beat Natan, he couldn't beat Bartra, Adrian keeps the ball in down by the dead ball line and is able to pick it up. Yeah it's a long, it's kind of a long hopeful ball and Jackson does really well against two of the Betis defenders there, he beats the first one as he tucks inside, just can't get ahead of Mattauakie, Mattauakie manages to get back in time and just topo the ball back in the direction of the goal line and that's when Adrian comes out and collects it quite comfortably, but again, Marlo Gusto, he's just, at the moment nothing seems to be going right for him, every time he touches the ball, every time he looks to lay it off, challenge, it's just, it's just falling apart from him, it's not right, it's not falling from him at the moment. Only his second start in the last 11 games for Chelsea, so potentially a sort of eyebrow raising selection this evening, Rhys James is on the bench, Enzo Muresca has managed to get more football out of him this season, for a little while, for Chelsea, five changes for Chelsea tonight from the 1-0 win, Nottingham Forest on Sunday, find themselves behind against Rail Betis, 20 minutes remaining in the first half, Ball, Wittnetto, wide on the right, brings it in field, he's followed by Abde, passes back to Badiasil, straight up the middle of the pitch to Caesado, across it comes to Fernandez, stretches to control, it quickly moves it on to Mattawaykis, Savali is back in position to cover to Chelsea, when he goes back to Cucaraya, little 1-2 with Caesado, then Cucaraya looks for the pass down the touch line, Anthony makes the challenge, and Chelsea win the throw. Yeah, Betis being really good, just every time that ball goes in the midfield to Caesado, two Fernandez, they're just on him, every time they've got the ball back to the ball, because Chelsea are looking for those little passes inside all the time, and Betis at the moment have got it under control, they're just waiting for it, the minute that ball goes in there their pounce. First major European final for Rail Betis, they lead Chelsea 1-0, Mattawaykis on the corner of the Betis penalty area, Wall of Green and White in front of him, goes dancing down the left hand side, Parth is blocked by Savali, whistling at the Betis fans, trying to distract him back, it comes to Cucaraya, Badiasil on the ball, for Chelsea, blue shirts, blue shorts, white numbers on the back, Gusto back here to Chalabar, Chelsea have been forced back to the halfway line, Badiasil gets his head up, doesn't really see an option ahead, Cucaraya tries to slide one through the middle, might break to Fernandez just too far ahead of him, Adrienne saw the danger, comes rushing out and thumps it away with his right foot, Betis 1, Chelsea 0. Almost coming favour of Chelsea there, in the end it just was a little bit too heavy, in the end Adrienne had the opportunity to rush out of his goal outside the box and just put his foot right behind it. First final for Rael Betis, first semi-final this season as well because their previous best in European competition was a couple of quarter-finals, one in the cup when his cup back in the 70s, late 70s when they lost to Dino Mamosco, the last one actually against Chelsea in the quarter-finals of the cup when his cup back in 1998, Chelsea won 5-2 on aggregate, first leg they won away from home, 2-1, Torre Andre Flogot 2, second leg they won 3-1 at Stamford Bridge and Gianfranco Zola of course scored the winner in the final, against Stuttgart to win the cup when his cup for Chelsea there, behind in the conference league final tonight, they're attacking down the left, Maduakis crossing, nearly finds Jackson, he got a touch on the ball, couldn't control it, Sabali passes out, Cucaraya is there to intercept, Anthony is flat on his back but it goes out for a throw in to Rael Betis in the right back position, yeah it was better from Chelsea this time down the left hand side, Maduakis the first time really just sort of took a touch, took on the defender, finds a bit of space, looks to find, hit it to that near polished area, Jackson's coming towards it and then it's just good defending, a little bit late to getting on the end of it for Jackson but it's better. The camboo jumps, tries to control the ball in midair, handles it as he does so for a kick for Chelsea, Caesero takes that quickly, here's Gusto who has had a shaky first half hour for Chelsea the young Frenchman, Bani Ashil, left footed centre back draws his man in, goes wide to Cucaraya, can't find Maduakis, loose ball, collected by four nows, won this competition with West Ham two seasons ago, Abdey's got space again here for Rael Betis on the left hand side, Gusto back pedaling Abdey, screams past him, deflected cross into the side netting and that will go behind for a Rael Betis corner. Mala Gusto does really really well in the end, it looks like he's been beaten all down, Abdey just put his head down and a turn of speed past him but Gusto does really really well, diving challenge gets that block right at the depth. Saw a close up of those Rael Betis shirts all laid out in the dressing rooms here at Stadion Brotswad before the game, white panel on the back with the green number, the words forever green written underneath, here's Isko, little touch inside the penalty area, dances past one challenge, lays it back, Rodriguez gets a shot away, no power, blocked, Palmer then, side footed to ball towards Mala Ueke and Chelsea looking dangerous on the counter, Mala Ueke can get there first, Gusto goes bombing on past him on the left hand side, Mala Ueke sees blue shirts on the right and Betis desperately trying to get back in numbers, netto, scurrying forward with the ball at his feet, Palmer wants it, gets it, cross comes into the box, Natan heads it away, Abdey is there, nods it down, four nows on the spin, Hoyset high in the air, Badi Ashile is underneath it, controls it with the in step of his left boot and then passes back to Kupar Raya and Chelsea start again from inside their own half, so half an hour for the UA for conference league final has been played, Rael Betis scored in the ninth minute, if you have just joined us on five live or BBC Radio London, you can listen to us on the BBC Sounds app as well, Betis scoring in the ninth minute, Abdey with the goal from the brilliant Isko pass, Chelsea trying to get back into the game, yet to test Adrienne, netto on the right, gets the cross in beyond Adrienne, beyond everyone, it bounces, collected by Madelowek, skills from him, Sabali's not falling for any of that, makes the tackle, Chelsea win the corner, I think that's first corner of the game for Chelsea. Yeah, could well be there, Sabali just stands his ground, doesn't really have to do much, Manawiki ties it, he's throwing his legs over the balls, dummies, step overs, he just runs straight in to the defender. Netto's going to take it short to Palmer, wide on the left for Chelsea, Palmer couple of touches, back it comes to Gusto, Gusto's cross, it's Isko, Gusto gets there, flicks it down the line to Palmer, tries to hold off Isko, shoulder to shoulder, Palmer gets a touch on the ball, can't control it, and it goes behind for the Rael Betis goal kick, and when he needs to defend, Isko is all business as well, because he's a playmaker, isn't he Mark, but he does the dirty bits as well. Yeah, he does, we're watching the goal again on TV, Isko's pass is brilliant, absolutely brilliant, and the finish is excellent as well, but yeah, you're right, the thing is as well, Chelsea are quite slow at the moment, quite slow in possession, they're being caught out a couple of times as well, it's almost like they're still in first gear, they need to shift through the gears a little bit more in possession, so when they get the ball they feel like, wow, we've got it, okay, we can hold off, we can play around them, Betis is just timing it really well, they're closing down in numbers, they're putting a lot of pressure on the ball, but at the right moment, and winning the ball off Chelsea, Chelsea have been frustrated, and the quality of passing at times has been really poor so far. Another explosion of noise from the Betis fans, away to our left, in this modern circular stadium here in Poland, Madoeki tries to hit a first time ball on the turn, took his eyes off the ball, and missed it completely, air shot, goes out for a throw into Betis. Well that's another example of it, where Madoeki had time to take a touch, then play the ball instead he tries a really difficult pass, no need to try and rush things, there's still a lot of time to play in this game, they need to take their time, calm down a little bit, find some rhythm. Anthony flicks ahead of forward, you heard the howl from the cambo, thought he was fouled as he tried to control it, it's with Nicholas Jackson, Cardoso behind him, four nows, plays the pass away, the referee then decides to blow for a foul on Nicholas Jackson, so Chelsea would get a free kick midway inside the rail, Betis half, 12 minutes remaining in the first half, here's Kaisado, backheels the ball to himself, then uses Badi Ashil, crossed the chalabar on the halfway line here with Gusto, forward to Kaisado, Kaisado's scoop pass looking for Parma, Natan heads it away, Cardoso is there, controls it, uses Rodriguez in the left back position, the cambo, chest the ball to his left hand side, the cambo gets it back from Abdey and then Isco looking for the Abdey, run down the left, passes beyond him and Jorgensen is able to come out and get it for Chelsea, they start to build from the back, here's Gusto in central midfield, across to Enzo Fernandez, captains arm back, bright green tonight, wrapped around his left bicep, right hand, strap with a white bandage, chalabar, tall figure at center back for Chelsea, little one two with Gusto, plays across to Kukereya, Kukereya thinks about using Madiwaki on the left, didn't think he was on, plays back to Badi Ashil, Kukereya and Madiwaki both throw their arms up as if to say well, didn't get that right, here's Parma, halfway line, wide on the right, swings the left boot at the ball to pass it back, cross the Chelsea back four, forward straight here to Kaisato, Gusto's made the run down the inside right channel, ball bounces in front of him, gets their first head of Natan, lays it back here to Pedro, Parma's in support, Pedro's going to try left footed shot, ambitious and kills it well wider the target. Yeah, wasteful opportunity there, Neto has a lot of time, he has too many options in the end, the sides shot himself as he tucks inside from the corner of the A&R box, he just gets underneath it and skies it and well wide and over the crossbar by considerable margin. Green and white certainly dominates the stadium, this giant patch of Betis fans away to our left hand side, the pitch obviously, green grass, white lines but the sort of UEFA Conference League livery as well is green and black and that is sort of draped all over the stadium as well. So that suits Betis, referee thinks there's been a time wasting going on here from Adrianne so you heard a few shrill blasts on the whistle there to tell the Betis goalkeeper to hurry it along, doesn't really hurry it along but eventually thumps the ball downfield with his right foot, the camboo wins the header, finds Abdey, quick ball to Isco, Isco's a stocky figure, bandy leg runner, passes the ball to his left, not seen much on the attacking front from Ricardo Rodriguez, Isco takes over from Rodriguez, Caicedo tries to tackle him, great balance from Isco there until he's eventually shoved over by Caicedo off the ball, Betis are allowed to continue the attack and they've had the chances in this game leading 1-0, Sabali brings it in field from the right, four nails back here to Bartra, Bartra across to Antony, chased by Cucarrea, Antony passes back into his own half, Bartra runs to get to that ball ahead of Nicholas Jackson, got time here to play back to Adrianne, Jackson comes jogging towards, in Betis goalkeeper plays it to his left and Natan, a few more bellowing songs from the Betis fans and suddenly a dangerous move building down the left hand side, Abdey flick on to Isco, makes ground quickly, he's up against Cousteau just outside the penalty area over on the left wing, holds on to the ball to Betis for now, looks for that little switch pass into the box for Abdey, passed Abdey and Jorgensen is able to collect in his six yard box, Mark Schwartzer. Yeah better defending for Mala Cousteau, he just didn't dive in on Isco, Isco was wetting from the dive in, he dropped a couple of shoulders, a couple of stepovers, Mala Cousteau just held his ground, moved him back out away from the goal and Isco's reverse pass in behind was then well defended, Trevor Trevichelver came across, realised he could let it go to the goalkeeper, so it was better play from Chelsea, karma and more controlled. Just eight minutes left in the first half though, they're behind and they're yet to test Adrianne in the game, it's been a very comfortable progression for Chelsea to this final all the way through, very different story tonight, Cousteau on the ball across here to Chalabar, Rael Betis in their defensive shape, longer ball comes from Badi Ashile, directly wide to Madiouaki, good control, drags it in on the laces of his left boot, little bit of skill on the left hand side, rolls it back to Kukerea, he delays on the pass, turns 360 degrees, finds Madiouaki in close support, across here to Kaisado, 30 yards out, little chip ball, Palmer tries to knock it down to Jackson, volleyed away by Bartre Augusto, looks to get onto the loose ball on the edge of the box, Betis feel there was a foul in there, the referee's going to let the game keep going, little bit more danger from Chelsea here, late in the first half, Palmer gets it from Neto, soft call high above the knee, the cambo goes chasing, Palmer plays it back to Chalabar, here to Badi Ashile, forward to Palmer, had to move quickly to keep possession for Chelsea, then Cousteau back into their own half, they go and Chalabar gets the ball again and strokes a low ball across the halfway line to Kukerea, right footed pass from him finds Madiouaki, Fernandez makes a burst down the left hand side and then he didn't see the pass coming, he didn't think Madiouaki was going to release that, stopped, all back into the Betis area, not the best there from four nows, Bartre slides in to rescue the situation, Betis were waiting for an offside flag, that comes, it'll be a free kick to the Spanish team. Yeah Fernandez makes that run in the left hand side, Madiouaki I'm not sure whether he saw him or just felt he couldn't play him, the ball by Tommy does play it to him, it looks like he was offside, that's what the referee's blown for, for Fernandez to be offside, again a wasted opportunity for Chelsea and really good sort of territorial positioning, just at the moment again, just can't kind of find that rhythm. I've been to watch Rael Betis at home a couple of seasons ago, they lost to Manchester United in the last 16 in the Europa League, I remember their fans being quite something that night, they have been very impressive inside this stadium tonight, Adrián the goalkeeper, clears the ball from the free kick, downfield, Bacambu is chasing, Kupere is able to cushion it on the instep of his left boot, Fernandez looks for Palmer in midfield, intercepted four nows, quickly across to Abde, Abde is able to turn, face up against Gusto, Neto tries to help out on the defensive front for Chelsea, Isco gets involved and of course finds his man with the pass, clever poke forward to Abde, back to Isco, strong challenge by Qaisado, free kick for Rael Betis, right on the corner of the Chelsea penalty area, they cannot handle Isco, they cannot handle Abde. Yeah they can, I mean there's, I think there could have been either, could have been easily two fouls there, the first one for Molo, Gusto, referee allows play to continue, then it's Qaisado, then in the end who dives in, I'm not sure, after watching the replay, whether or not he gets the ball, we're watching it now, I mean I don't think the first one from Gusto is a foul and Qaisado actually gets the ball, it's a really good challenge actually and the referee is there, he's ten yards away and he gives a free kick to Betis and I don't think there's no way that's a free kick, it's actually a really good challenge. Clever challenge, sort of comes in from the side and wraps his foot around Isco but definitely got boot on the ball and now the free kick in a dangerous position for Betis, leading Chelsea 1-0 in their first ever major European final. Antony scored a stunner against Fiorintina in the second leg of the semi-final, in conversation with Isco, two incredibly talented footballers standing over the ball, spells danger for Chelsea, behind in this final Antony just pointing, ensuring that Chelsea wall is ten yards, whistle blows, short one to Antony, kills it in to the far post, Jürgenstens stretches, gets a hand on the ball, Natan shot his blot and Chelsea are able to get it away, quickly on to Neto down the left hand side, sliding challenge in the midfield from Fournows, who celebrates as Isco scored a goal, I saw him score a goal in the Europa Conference League semi-final second, led for West Ham away to AZ Outmard that took them through to the final and that was some celebration for a sliding block by Pablo Fournows. Three minutes left in the first half, plus added time, Chelsea with two-thirds of the possession in the game so far, trailing 1-0, Betis with six shots on goal, two on target, crucially the goal from Abdey in the ninth minute, Madelueke looking for the run and Fernandez, good ball Fernandez, Adrián comes sliding out bravely, gathers the ball, might have taken a knock from Fernandez as well, good goalkeeping Mark Schwartzer. Really good, really good goalkeeping there, Fernandez is really close to getting a touch on the ball and there's nothing Fernandez can do with the challenge because the way that Adrián comes in, he dives in but he holds on to the ball, it's a really good ball for Madelueke over the top, just gets away from Fernandez, Adrián really good goal, I think he gets a little bit fortunate but holds on to it, good goalkeeping. Very happy there as Enzo Fernandez sort of came to have a word and tried to get into his fee, I don't think it was really apologizing for the challenge, Fernandez had to go for the ball, leapt over Adrián, caught him with his boots but Adrián did the job for Rael Betis and they are doing the job for Manuel Pellegrini and these Boyan fans inside this stadium tonight, Betis won Chelsea 0, five live, BBC sounds of BBC Radio London, fabulous first touch from Isco, Anthony trying to beat Crook-A-Rae for pace on the outside, shoulder to shoulder, both stumble, both get up, his Anthony down by the byline, teasing Crook-A-Rae with the ball at his left foot, plays back to Sabale, little one two with Isco, that one doesn't work, runs to Jackson, his pass forward is blocked, Badi O'Sheer is able to chest that down on the edge of the Chelsea box, feeds it to Quesado, good run forward from Gusto into space, quickly shipped on here to Parma, for nows he's back to try and cover, something Madelueke pops up on the right hand side for Chelsea so they've switched the wingers late in the first half, Gusto gets it, gets that cross in towards the far post, bounces, Netto tries to head it back across, Goldbacher is there, volleys it high in the air, Anthony is underneath the ball, it's already gone over the touch line for throwing Chelsea, yeah better play from Chelsea, their mother, Gusto makes a good run down the right hand side, he's delivery across just slightly overhead, if he hits it with a right sort of pace on that ball, there's every chance there's a Chelsea play on the end of it, but unfortunately slightly over hit to the bounce at the far post area then, it's just a little bit too high for Netto to control, Manuel Pellegrini is trying to get his team, certainly that midfield line up the pitch a little, Cucarera has gone for the longer diagonal here, headed away from Parma, chested down by four nows, closed down by Jackson, gets it to Wisco, layoff to Cardoso, first time ball looking for the run of Abdei, asking way too much here, and Chalabar comes running back, night skies above us here in Stadion, Brotswaw, quarter to ten in Poland, could be extra time, could be penalties tonight of course as well, Chelsea need to find themselves a goal though, have lost a couple of games in this competition, back in August, all the way back in August in the playoff round, a way to serve that, didn't do them any danger though, won it on aggregate and through they went into the league phase as Parma plays it across here to Enzo Fernandez, Fernandez looking for that ball into the box for Gusto, cleared only as far as Fernandez, forward to Jackson, layoff to Cucarera, wide it comes to Netto, one minute about in time at the end of the first half, Fernandez with the curl, a big deflection on this one goes spinning past the left hand post and behind for a corner to Chelsea, late pressure. Yeah as a decent attempt from Fernandez, I just don't think it would have tested Adrian, I think Adrian was making the run across to his left hand side, the deflection just took it that little bit further, I don't think there was enough pace on that ball to really trouble the goalkeeper. So Chelsea's Argentine captain Enzo Fernandez goes over to the right wing to take this corner, 30 seconds remaining in the first half, huge bang, the Betis supporters behind the goal away to our left, the way swinging delivery, Chalabar ran towards it, couldn't get ahead on it, Parma nods it up in the air, Chelsea's got to be a bit careful they don't get caught on the counter, good block from Parma, Sight put it away from Rodriguez, Betis can't get anyone to the ball and Gusto jogs back into his own half and gathers possession for Chelsea, 15 seconds left in the first half, Anthony looks annoyed about something, don't think a game goes by without Anthony looking a little bit disgruntled now and then, Caesado on the run forward nearly bumped off the ball, does fall over, referee decides to play an advantage here, closing second to the first half, Jackson needs to do some of the ball quickly, finds Caesado looking for the run of Cucaraya, headed up in the air by Natan, Caesado wins the next header then Abdey nods it away and the Real Betis fans roar with relief at the sound of the halftime whistle and again the coaching staff, the backroom staff and the subs from Real Betis all get up and try and urge their fans to greater efforts, it is Real Betis who lead at halftime, Chelsea caught out early in the game, they gave the ball away inside their own half and as we've already said Mark Schwartz at the pass from Isco was fabulous and the finish from Abdey unearing, yeah it was, yeah there was all of that Isco's pass wasn't it, he's the one that creates that chance obviously they win the ball high up, Malagruzla gives the ball away, Betis really really quick in that transition and Isco's pass is sublime and a great touch from Abdey and a really good finish as well, Chelsea need to do a bit more to test Adriane in the Real Betis goal, Real Betis could have scored more, Jorgensen with the save from Bartra, Badia Schiele with the block on the Johnny Cardoso shot as well, plain sailing for Chelsea so far in this competition not tonight in Poland, the big one the final, they trail at halftime, Real Betis won, Chelsea nil, yeah Pat Nevin, Real Betis looked really really untroubled thus far, they absolutely do and tactically they're winning it easily just now Pellegrini's got it right, he's seen what the weaknesses are for Chelsea and I think we all can see what the weaknesses, it's the right full back position and because of that he's able to go and play the ball in there and get the man Isco every time he gets the ball, he has a class act but what has stunned me completely is, I think it's really obvious right, you've got three centre backs you're in Vertengusto, you're asking him to sit in centre midfield okay, he's not a centre midfield player, he's the right back who goes and he flies down the right hand side either you know inside or outside he's winger, that's what he's really good at and he's dead good at that right, you're asking players as an inverted player, he isn't very good at that, why are you not putting Cuccarella in now, that's what he's good at, he's great at that, or just bring Race James off the bench now who can do exactly that, he could do that yes he could do exactly that but be aware that Race James you know you one-on-one would defend with a very good quick winger, may have some difficulties himself but I can't see why you don't see that early on after 10 minutes right that's not working okay just tell Cuccarella to invert into the midfield and tell Gusto to be a right centre back, it's fine it's okay it works but time and time again and Gusto looks as if he's having an absolute stinker but he's playing a position that doesn't suit him and clearly Rea betters knows exactly what they're doing there, they scored the goal for there, giving the ball away there, they're just playing the ball into there all the time and now Gusto, he's last 90 tackles me, he's diving in, he's making mistakes, he's giving the ball away and he's really really spooked by it and that's just one of the problems that Chelsea have got, you know I've got half time it's only one nil down and this is where you earn your corn, if you're a maresca this is where you earn your corn, make the right decisions at happy and he's got some decisions to make. Rea, I'll bet it's have been brilliant Mark but you know I mean it's kind of a cliche when people say I won't want to be in that Chelsea dressing room, just looking at Enzo Moresca's kind of behaviour in that first half I really would not want to be in that dressing room. No you wouldn't want to be but you know for all of the obviously the frustration on the sidelines it's his opportunity then to get his messages across to his players in a call and a calmer kind of environment so he needs to have a bit of force behind his instructions but also you know there's 45 minutes minimum to go in this game so they need to get themselves back in this game, there's more than capable of doing so there are just too many mistakes being made out there and obviously my leg Gusto is the one that's been at the the middle of most of that and I'm right, I'm right, Gusto tucking inside he's not comfortable there he's made way too many mistakes that has been their biggest problem but he's not the only one because there's lots of players who've just made bad decisions, poor passes, short passes in tight areas when they don't need to. Abdey Pat, brilliant and Isco as well I can just imagine as such a technical player you're really enjoying watching him. Yeah I mean Abdey fantastic, very good and he's getting the ball and he's looking really good but but it is Isco, maybe he is just totally fabulous and I was trying to think of who he reminded me of because he was, he doesn't, he plays the perfect 10 position because you know British players over the years have not known how to play that position because they go and stand in the area, you never stand in that area that's the last thing in the world you do, you arrive in the area you know between your centre forward and the midfield when the ball arrives where the space is don't go and stand in the space and kill it I'm watching him play it is honestly it is a masterclass of how to do it and then he does, he's doing the things that would kill me or something like would do it the best when the space isn't there okay I'll just drop back into fullback and I'll take the ball there and I'll control it from there honestly he I mean he's always been a delightful player and he's by a distance the best player in that football field right now but today he is having a ball and there was a suggestion he wouldn't even start if Los El Sos was fit fully fit he might have started before his score which is quite astonishing but there's a reason why he's one major trophy he's made of tournaments and he's he's still a class act and he starts his and Pat who was Raquel Mies manager at the Arial? Manuel Pellegrini knows that wouldn't you exactly I said probably the South Americans we know how to do a number 10s and we know how to get the best out and crikey today. Pat, Mark, Ali thank you all very much indeed there you go then Chelsea Nill, Rael Bates won half time in the final of the conference league obviously second half commentary on the way from Poland next we're going to talk Cricket as well ahead of Harry Brooks first game proper in full-time charge of England's 50 overside so I'll speak to Stefan Schemmelt we'll hear from Harry Brock after the news on Five Live with Tim Daly. Good evening the Crown Prosecution Service has set out for the first time the full list of charges being faced by the social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan in the UK are accused of 21 offences in total with both suspected of rape actual bodily harm and human trafficking as our correspondent Charlotte Gallagher now explains they're also facing prosecution in Romania. They will only be brought back to the UK when criminal proceedings against them in Romania are concluded and that could include prison sentences so we're not expecting them back in the UK anytime soon the brothers deny all charges I mean these are huge social media personalities they have millions of followers but they are also hugely controversial.

When it's a quintessential part of British summer when it's the tournament you've waited four years for when it's down to a nail biting match point rally how can they keep going I'm tired just watching I think I need a banana nothing brings us together like great TV and a TV license covers you to watch all TV channels so you can enjoy a whole summer of world-class sport it also funds everything you love from the BBC including iPlayer and live radio like this BBC Radio Five Life this is Five Life Sports with Steve Crossman listen on BBC sound. Rael Bettis lead Chelsea by a goal to nil in the final of the conference league in Vrotsvav will be back for second half commentary shortly cricket first Jamie Smith is going to open the batting for England against the West Indies tomorrow it'll be the first time he's done so in a senior 50 over match Harry Brook takes charge of his first series as captain since replacing Joss Butler he's been telling our Chief Cricket reporter Stefan Schemelt the type of captain he wants to be. Relaxed calm and try and keep that calm and relaxed environment among the squad yeah and then just see how the game plays out make decisions on the spot and yeah hopefully the right ones. How do you want your team to play? Aggressive I want the batters to be able to put the best balls under pressure put the best bowlers under pressure be able to manipulate the field score big runs make match winning contributions and then the bowling side I want them to be able to work towards wickets and and have the skills to be able to bowl to a certain dimension or or be able to back themselves to hit the skills so it's it's hard for the batters and in the field I want them to be 100 committed and chase the ball hard to the boundary obviously the white ball team hasn't been at its best over the last couple of years and we're going to try and change that turn that around and yeah get some really good results under the under the table for the for the fans. Why do you think that's been why has the white ball team not been at its best? I think the scheduling has been tough for Joss I think he hasn't been able to have his best players in every series and hopefully that's something we can change going forward and yeah get get our best batters get our best bowlers in and yeah and try and keep it as consistent as possible. Tell us about the team then so Jamie Smith to open he was up to number three in the champions trophy he's gone up another spot what's behind that decision? Me and Baz just have this burning desire that he could be an amazing white ball opener and he's got the strength to do so he's got the the technique to to be able to face the swinging ball as we've seen in Test Cricket he's he's a very very good player and like I said before he can put their their best balls under pressure from any position. Both for you and English cricket as a whole it's such a massive year with a stacked schedule how are you going to balance that both personally and making sure that the white ball team always gets the the best players because that was a problem in the past wasn't it the white ball team didn't always get the the better cricketers. Yeah I think the scheduling is a little bit better now I don't think there's any real lapovers or whatever you call it but yeah I think it should be a little bit easier to have that consistent balance in the squads and in the teams going forward. Last week Brendan and Ben talked about the messaging that they they wanted coming from the Test team it's about being a bit smarter in the media is that something that carries over to the white ball team as well. Yeah I think so we're trying to keep it very similar to Test so we've got very similar ethos which I know I try and do as a player I try and put the best balls under pressure and and I do try and chase the ball as hard as I can to the boundary and give give a hundred percent in everything I do so that's that is the messaging that we've been saying and yeah and hopefully that can stick it in this white ball group as well. Harry Brook with Stefan Schemelt-Stefan is with us now just on Jamie Smith first of all Stefan I mean they've lost nine of their last 10 ODIs so they had to do something differently. Yeah they did it's not a surprise that he's in the team but it is a surprise that he's opening for a few reasons you said yourself he's never done it in in senior list A cricket he batted at number three in the Champions trophy and only made 24 runs there's also another option in the team as well Will Jackson's down at number seven and he's a regular white ball opener but it's just another example of England seeing something in a player and backing them to do a job Harry Brook said it there he's got the technique to face the new ball he's also got loads of shots one day openers have to be versatile and Smith can be that he's got the gears so it is different it's a bit of a risk but it's a great opportunity for Jamie Smith. Presumably the reason you asked him why he's been promoted up the order following the Champions trophy is because it did not go well for him in the Champions trophy. Yeah he looked a bit of a square peg in a round hole and that he didn't really know how to play and he was following Phil Salt at number three Phil Salt was opening the Champions trophy he's a really aggressive player tried to play all the shots Smith looked like he thought he had to do the same thing as well now Salt's been left out of the one-day squad he's in the T20 squad next week so hopefully Smith as an opener can just use those different skills that he's got and mentioned that he's got the gears he's got 50 overs to build in innings that is a a long time but yeah it was a little bit of a surprise and it almost felt like England had decided we want Jamie Smith in the team but the only vacancy is as an opener so that's where he's got to bat. I guess other headlines returning IPL players Jacob Bethel, Will Jackson you mentioned and and Joss Butler who you know he didn't have to come back for this I don't know how the his IPL franchise will feel about it so do you just sort of say fair play for still having the heart to want to do it? Absolutely and it says maybe a little bit about Joss Butler what he wants to do with the rest of his England career because you know when he gave up the captaincy what was it a month ago six weeks ago now he might have called time on it he could go he could have gone off and earned his millions in the white ball game knowing that he's done everything that he could for England he's captained them to a T20 World Cup win he'd played in a 50 over World Cup win and he'd been the captain but he's back he wants to be at his best in international cricket and it's Butler that England need to get the best out of at the end of his time as captain he looked pretty miserable but he's still the best white ball batter in the world or one of the best white ball batters England's best of all time. England will look at the IPL and see that the IPL has probably always had the best of Joss Butler certainly in recent times so now England will be thinking well how can we get a bit of that as well. Thank you very much Steph and TestmarchSpecial will have ball by ball commentary from 1pm tomorrow on Five Sports Extra and BBC Sounds the latest TMS special pod is a profile on the New England women's captain Nat Siver Brunt hearing from schoolmates, teammates and her wife as well one other cricket line for your Lancashire of Parted Company with men's head coach Dale Benkenstein after going winless in the first two months of the new county championship season.

Reese James pushing the back knocking the back of the leg as well from Isco as they challenge for the ball on the halfway line referee gives the free kick to Chelsea Philip Jorgensen in goal so James now right back Cook Araya on the ball at left back Chalabar and Badia Shield the two centre backs Fernandez Qaisado in central midfield Neto wide right Madiwakey on the left and Palmer trying to wriggle his way out of a tight spot here on the right wing for Chelsea playing in behind Nicholas Jackson Chalabar miss controls the ball spins up hits him on the right hand that's clumsy that'll be a free kick for rail Betis three minutes gone in the second half Betis won Chelsea Nils yeah there's a little awkward one there but Trevor Chalabay tries against him on the end of it misses it and as it when he misses it just bounces up all of a sudden and it's Australian always and it's sort of in an outstretched position Anthony's made a clever run from the free kick the diagonal run from right to left gets the ball Cook Araya has followed him all the way over to the right back position barges into the back of Anthony then Perot is fouled by Neto Betis get the free kick Palmer's annoyed bounces the ball down into the turf and it lands in Perot's lap and rail Betis and their players will be lapping that up I saw Cole Palmer in conversation with the match officials in the tunnel and you could tell Chelsea early on in the game bit rattled bit wound up about the way they feel this game is being refereed at the moment though Mark Schultz the Betis have been the better team they have been yeah Chelsea have made too many mistakes in that first half obviously we're punished for for one of the big mistakes in the game and then from there on it's really been a case of Betis just controlling oh matter of fact that is a good ball into space Jackson onto it Angles tight inside the penalty on the left lays it back no one there apart from two Betis defenders and then they implore the assistant referee to raise his flag which he does eventually and gives the offside against Chelsea the rail Betis lineup then Adrienne former Liverpool West Ham goalkeeper between the sticks for Betis tonight Yusuf Sabali Senegalese international at right back left back is now the Frenchman Romain Perot Marc Bartra and Natan the Brazilian the two centre backs Pablo Fornals Johnny Cardoso and Isco who has been an absolute joy to watch this evening so far Anthony Abde the goal scorer and Cedric Bacambu the centre forward jumping for the ball right now it clears him and it runs all the way through to Jorgensen so the game starts to settle in the second half Chelsea have 40 minutes left try and find an equaliser at the moment to take this final to extra time Abde quick in with the challenge on Chalabar and it goes out for a Chelsea throw in the right back position major European finals for Chelsea seven played six one only defeats in Moscow on penalties against Manchester United in the Champions League final but behind in this conference league final tonight Chalabar to Jorgensen Jorgensen sweeps it across his own penalty area Kuparaya speeding to the ball keeps it in play Madelike on the edge of his own box got to be careful that was a pass back into his own six yard area Jorgensen fix it away with his right foot Jackson Leeds tries to control on the chest then the foot is high and he's kicked Bartra in the shoulder who came through trying to win it and that is going to be a pre-kick to Betis no yellow cards in the game yet no need for them really yeah no and that was one maybe the referee could have pulled the yellow card out to me look it's a high-fought and he barely touches him he does when it gets the ball he barely touches him as he goes down and it's pretty pretty theatrical in the response he's up pretty quickly in the end anyway Bartra but yeah I mean for for Chelsea it was actually good phase of play they dealt with the pressure from Betis really well that's probably the first time tonight they've done so and they've managed to go from left to right back across again and the goal for Jorgensen plays a really good ball into Jackson who comes a little bit off the halfway line towards the ball his first touch just a little bit heavy that allows Bartra to get in the way as he tries to control at his foot rail betis have a throw so Barley takes it attacking position on the right Anthony Stoops heads it back towards him and it goes out for a throw rail betis is 71 year old manager Manuel Pellegrini is about to throw a 19 year old into the fray of a european final tonight that is Jesus Rodriguez product to the rail betis academy midfielder and he is getting ready to come on into this game abday is down at the moment hauled to his feet by Reese James and being helped off the field by the referee so is abday the one who is struggling who is going to come off we're just going to have to wait and see rail betis lead Chelsea 1-0 as I said Saturday night 8 o'clock don't miss it into the land against Harry Sancho man the champions league final John Murray and Chris Sutton with the commentary five life sport on air from midday final round of games in rubber unions Gallagher premiership we got commentary of five pass three on Bristol Harlequins Bristol one of five teams buying for three remaining spots in the end of season playoffs Leicester sale Bristol Gloucester and Saracens abday is off Jesus Rodriguez is on 19 years old playing for his club in their first ever major european final and he takes up position on that left hand side Chelsea have the ball eight minutes gone in the second half Kukerea creeps forward with it plays it to badia shield little one two then Qaysado receives it inside his own half across it comes to Chalabar Chalabar puts William Oomph into that pasted netto poor delivery from him trying to find Palmer there is Rodriguez first touch for him gives it to the 33 year old Isco receives a pass in a tight space again good strength from Isco holds off netto works the pass through to Rodriguez badia shield comes across to cut it out for Chelsea clears high in the air Palmer tries to win a flick on falls nicely for betis his mark Bartra centre back across to fellow centre back Natan who's off balance as he clears with his left foot and it goes out for a throw in to betis an abday abday there who's already got the tracksuit top on who scored the goal in this final has come off injured and then as the ball went behind him for the throw in he tried an outrageous sort of swing of the leg to back heal it on the half volley and didn't make contact he can't be all that injured Jackson back to Qaysado Qaysado has to stretch to find Kukerea cross to badia shield chip pass to the left controlled by Fernandez Madiwaki sets off at speed down the left hand side receives the ball Subali closes the space down cross comes in towards Jackson and Rian jumps for it Jackson is down hurt inside the six yard box the referee gives a corner and then immediately waves from medical attention to come on to the field for Nicholas Jackson and surrounded by the Chelsea players who feel there should be a penalty awarded for the challenge on Nicholas Jackson we are not going to be able to tell Mark Schroder until we see the replay badia shield booked for his complaints to the referee yeah looks like Adrian's a bit late and he catches Jackson and we have to watch some of the replay again from where we're sitting it does definitely look like we can see a picture now of the bench of Chelsea watching on their own monitor that's gone now but it was a heavy challenge we're seeing the cross now Madiwaki's ball into the box was a really nice ball Jackson jumps up no it's actually a really good effort from Adrian he gets his fist on the ball it's not a foul for me good goalkeeping initially it looks like he gets there late I think he does well the goalkeeper Bartlett jumps Jackson jumps Adrian jumps Adrian definitely gets fists on the ball then there's a collision of bodies Jackson thankfully is okay he's on his feet and he's been checked and there's just a scrum of people in the six-yard box at the moment as the referee Gierfan Pelto tries to sort it out no penalty for Chelsea VAR is Jerome Brissar the Frenchman tonight he will have had a look at that Chelsea management team we're having a look on the bench as well and the Chelsea fans trying to make some noise away to our right as well their team is behind here in Poland 10 minutes gone in the second half whistle blows for the corner one two three four five Chelsea players gathered around the penalty spot but a pushing and shoving in it comes from the left hand side lead from Badiashil it clears it drops the James he hits it well big deflection and behind it goes every block every tackle now being celebrated by the Real Betis players goodness me James hit that well oh what a strike from Rhys James I tell you what I'm not sure whether that's on target but Natan just puts his block on it massive big block puts it out for for another corner massive big body massive big block corner for Chelsea a waste from James again clears Badiashil chested down by Fernandez cross comes in from Jackson too close to Atrián balls on the ball inside the six-yard box and the offside flag was up anyway yeah I think it was just matter of where he was probably just a little bit off so we'll see as the corner comes in they deal with it half-hunt so the half-heartedly there Betis doesn't really get the clearance outside the box Fernandez plays in Nicholas Jackson on the left hand side he's just in an offside position for the reaction and analysis to the final tonight in the football daily podcast tomorrow on the BBC sounds out Isco scampering forward for Betis support from Anthony on the right hand side up against Cucaraya left-footed cross over hit for the shot or across not very good either way and behind it goes for the gold kick Manuel Pellegrini turns in frustration he said before the game mark he could become the oldest man ever to win a major European trophy as a manager could also become the first Chilean to do it as well first Chilean to manage in a major European final since Fernando Riera of Benfica back in the European Cup final in 1963 Madoakis ball just beyond Jackson goes chasing Atrián clever lets it run behind went as if to clear and then left it and behind it goes for the goal kick Betis won Chelsea now yeah the moment Chelsea just haven't done enough to cause Betis enough problems they've had some decent possession like they did in the first half but very little in product no real meaningful chances on goal and it's been a relatively calm calm and easy evening for Adrian so far Betis take the goal kick short to Atrián all in yellow away to our right Betis lost Verdi Blancos the green and white green and white stripes defending that goal away to our right had a powered away James is there netto stumbles past the ball and Perro lets it run for a throw in to Betis Enzo Muresca the pupil is pacing Manuel Pellegrini the master standing there directing operations just takes his left hand out of his pocket for a second free kick given against his team Chelsea look to go quickly with Enzo Fernandez little bit more urgency about them now as they will have to be we're approaching the last half hour of this final clever from Palmer body swerve left the ball behind left the defender behind his netto wide on the right scurries infield finds Rhys James Caesado 40 yards from goal in a central position not enough on the pass to find Madaway he could career slips in front of Anthony picks himself up ball is chested down by Fernandez Madaway he plays it to Caesado delays the delivery and then the pass hits the ref shame for Chelsea that because Enzo Fernandez and Cucarera in a good position on the left hand side yeah the referee I mean it's unfortunate the referee can't do it in these just hold these ground and Caesado just hits it straight into it we're looking now we can see that Chelsea are going to make another sub-door at least looks like two substitutions now Jayden Sancho definitely wanted to come on get in the instructions from the coaching team right now Chelsea need to find a way back into the final rail betties one of the biggest nights if not the biggest night in the football clubs history first-ever European final leading 1-0 Perot is down rolling around he's at his left foot trodden on by Pedro Netto but lately the assistant referee has raised his flag and given the free kick to Betis so the other changes leave I call will I can see is out there for Chelsea getting ready to come on the man who scored the crucial goal on Sunday at the City ground let's not forget of course Chelsea will be playing Champions League football next season having finished fourth in the Premier League at the end of this campaign only found out today only realized today but had they won this competition they actually get the choice of whether they want to play in the Champions League or the Europa League next season they would obviously choose the Champions League that choice in place for other clubs unlike Chelsea we may not be guaranteed a place in the group stages the league phase immediately the Champions League potentially might want to guarantee that in the Europa League by winning this competition Betis by the way finished sixth in the league they will play in the Europa League next season so double change coming for Chelsea Kukarayas whack the ball out of play he was looking for a pass down the left hand side Neto comes off for Sancho quickly off the field close to exchange of greeting and Benoit Bally a shield who started this final is off and Levi Colwell comes on so three subs on for Chelsea still they trail rail Betis by a goal to nil the Moroccan international ab day with that goal in the ninth minute of this game four nows ball forward flicked header from Anthony Sibali charges onto it gets a good touch on the ball skills crossing from the right nearly ran to Isco Chelsea get bodies in the way Kaisado spins and clears up towards the halfway line here's Cardoso back into his own half and Natan Natan plays back to Adrien Jackson tries to hurry him and does that well and then the ball hits Maduakie's arm controlled it with his left foot he was in a rush didn't control it properly bounce down and in the free kick goes to rail Betis march towards it I'll tell you what it was a half a chance there for Betis I think it was a Pekambu who runs into the box a just slightly loose trips over the ball steps on the ball falls over it otherwise there's a genuine chance for Betis to get a shot on goal in a really dangerous position probably about 10 12 yards out from goal James's header away defensive header for Chelsea Isco fouling Kaisado shrugs him off tries to foul him again Kaisado's unperturbed Fernandez curling pass down the middle Bartlett's got the run from Jackson covered actually and comes flying out of his box clears for the mess of arms and legs there called his own man Bartlett it goes out for a throw into Chelsea in the right back position constant rhythmic drum beat you can hear from the Betis fans away to our left hand side swathed in the green and white hoping for the biggest party of all in Poland tonight their third visit actually to the country in this competition this season Maddoek he gets the ball for Chelsea on the right Palmer making a run ahead Maddoek he can't find him chance for Betis to get this away four nows he's careful with his pass to Isco what's Isco got here little ball around the corner with his right foot for nows runs into trouble Fernandez gets onto it for Chelsea thinks about going left holds on to it finds James quick one two at short range between those two Kaisado whips it out to Kukereya quickly on to Sancho his first touch the evening dancing feet beats one man Anthony couldn't get past Sabali Sabali waits for Sancho to come in with the challenge beats him plays it back to Kardo so who clears downfield headed away by Colwell and it falls to the feet of Trevor Chalabar five live BBC sounds BBC Radio London in Wroclaw in Poland Betis won Chelsea nil Maddoek has run out of ideas they just run straight into Romain Perot goes down tries to buy a free kick doesn't get it Betis clear throwing for Chelsea on the right yeah I don't know what he's thinking because he just runs straight into him it's like it's not even a I mean Maddoek he maybe tries a couple of step over the game but just keeps going straight right into the defender it's clearly not a foul gives away possession it's just fortunate the clearance goes out and Chelsea get a throwing again 18 minutes gone second half Chelsea getting a bit more desperate here trailing one nil started this season as big favorites for this competition Sancho corner of the penalty area green and white shirts in front of him little ball to Palmer Palmer back to Sancho the pass was meant for Fernandez it eventually gets there Sancho again corner of the box finds a little channel here's Palmer on the ball inside the area gets away from him cleared away by Jezus Rodriguez Kukereya sprints back passes back first time to Jorgensen and Chelsea will build from inside their own half Cole Palmer's not been able to have the impact on this game that he would have wanted that Isco is having to rail Betis mark yeah they haven't really been involved have they I find that they don't play really as as a unit up front at the moment a lot of times it's an individual play it's a little bit better now since James Sancho's come on certainly there's been better unity up front and more urgency or Palmer's ball looks good head of down Chelsea a level Enzo Fernandez pops up at just the right time we said called Palmer have been quiet but it's a fabulous ball in behind the Betis defense Enzo Fernandez has scored some big goals this season but none bigger than that they are level in the final it's rail Betis one Chelsea one absolutely brilliant ball from Cole Palmer perfectly weighted over the defenders head diagonally into the box and Enzo Fernandez we've seen toward a couple of times this season gets on the end of the depth of touches into the corner Adrian no chance whatsoever it's exactly what Chelsea needed eight goal of the season only a second in this competition didn't need much of a touch on it just needed to guide it beyond the goalkeeper Adrian milking the celebration for all it is worth takes off the captain's armband and shows it to the Chelsea fans over there this is a final that Chelsea definitely care about clever header from Fernandez brilliant ball from Palmer it's one one I think it's the first time Cole Palmer's knocked a ball from open play into the box across into the box like that on that angle it's a fantastic ball it's so difficult to defend against and to what Enzo Fernandez fantastic run onto it like I said the slides of touches and it's in the back of the net really good finish really good play from Chelsea should be extra time could be penalties but we've still got 24 minutes to play plus added time in the second half how will rail Betis respond to the setback we're still not kicked off yet imagine VAR checking the goal I couldn't see too much wrong with it we are going to get back underway referee blows the whistle now it is rail Betis one Chelsea one spring in the step for Chelsea Palmer comes sprinting forward trying to put Betis players under pressure Jackson wins the ball back rolls to Mattauakie Mattauakie looking for Palmer on the right it does find him via a deflection Palmer little skills low right footed cross block by Natan then the offside flag goes up free kick for Betis oh so late the Reignsman's flag is so so late it looked originally like Cole Palmer was potentially offside but he just let play go on and on and on and on and then eventually left his flag up it's crazy how long it goes throwing for Chelsea throw it back into their own half here's Colwell Colwell across to Kukerea green and white shirts come flooding forward into the Chelsea half midway through the second half five live BBC Radio London all available on the BBC sounds out as always cracking finish on our hands here one one Sancho speeding forward forward his feet drops a shoulder Sibali just looks at the ball strong in the challenge and wins it for Betis Bartlett clears downfield Chalabar leaps in the air controls it deftly turns inside his own half and plays into Colwell Chelsea's just got a bit of balance about them right now Colwell's on Reese James is on Jayden Sancho they just look a bit aside they're into play as far far better at the moment now Jayden Sancho playing in the Champions League final for Borussia Dortmund last season playing in the Conference League final for Chelsea here Palmer surrounded by Greenham works shirts goes down once the free kick referee's not impressed Anthony slips can't keep the ball in play Kukerea clever runs to the ball picks it up takes the throw Palmer's got to get on his feet here and get involved here comes Chelsea Sancho Palmer first time curler Adrianne pats it down and grabs the ball in the six yard box Palmer back on the ground and then jumps to his feet again it's all happening yeah it is a decent chance I think he's trying to whip that to the far post it doesn't get enough on it it goes into the sort of towards the near post area that's where your understanding so straight down his throat gets it at the second attempt and again nice play from Chelsea Chelsea fans you can hear now drums beating from rail bit at Betis Chelsea fans singing in the blue shirts away to our right and surrounding us in this stand as well Perot makes a good run down the left for Betis the cross is headed away by Chalabar Cardoso gets onto it the American for Betis clever little touch up to the box here's Isco danger man brilliant tackle by Colwell just lowered his left leg like a tricketer in the field on the boundary just to block the ball so that Isco couldn't find a way through and Sancho comes sprinting away down the left hand side the final is opening up now in the second half of the second half Palmer running up to the edge of the area back onto that deadly left foot another little drag defenders watching where he's going eventually lays it back to James to Quesado forward to Fernandez Chelsea looking the best they've been in this final so far by an absolute mile at the moment Sancho controls the ball on the left plays it back to Cucarera everyone wants it now here's Quesado Quesado to Chalabar Chalabar opens play out to the right Madelueke sees the run of Palmer again Palmer stumbles but keeps his balance dangles his left foot in front of the ball he's got the 19 year old jesus rodriguez in front of him holds him off spins turns him gets the cross in and the header is in from Nicholas Jackson and that is quite brilliant from Cole Palmer to create that goal fabulous feet on the edge of the box half of the subs go running and sliding all over Nicholas Jackson but the rest of them go running to the man with magic in his feet Cole Palmer the twist the turn the touch the cross the header from Jackson and Chelsea were one nil down they now lead rail Betis by two goals to one absolutely brilliant from Cole Palmer just steps on the ball waits and waits draws the undefended arena and then just drops the show and turns him on a dime in behind the ball is brilliant Jackson's run to the dear post he's excellent and it's a fantastic goal from Chelsea all because of Cole Palmer absolute magician we've got a magician on each team tonight Isco's been doing it for rail betis but in the last five six minutes Cole Palmer has definitely been pulling the strings for Chelsea let's just watch it on the replay now face to face with Rodriguez just waits for him to sort of come towards him turns spins him and then the cross as well and Jackson actually does well that comes fast and he just guides the header in at the near post Chelsea lead Betis by two goals to one oh the way he spins Rodriguez is brilliant absolutely brilliant the ball into the box is excellent it actually comes off his chest yeah it's into the back of the net he's very fortunate he's off his chest and it's very close for Adrian making the save but he does that but they're still checking it I don't think that that's for me that looks the deafening off his chest Nicholas Jackson well we were talking about whether he needed to make a man's after the sending off at Newcastle didn't cost Chelsea in the end lost that game that finished fourth in the Premier League to play in the Champions League next season and goodness man we've got a haircut coming on the field now for rail betis Eito Ruibao has coloured the hair left hand side pink right hand side light blue it looks like one of those mixed slushies you can get in the cinema those sort of bright blue bright pink revoltingly sugary drinks that's what his hair looks like tonight but it's got also the sort of the texture of candy floss as well what a turnaround in this final two goals in five minutes Palmer creating them both yeah and it's no surprise I mean it's come just not long after the substitutions I think I think they've been absolutely massive Sancho and Carwell coming on together with Reese James it's made all the difference for Chelsea they just said before in the commentary before that second goal they just looked a lot more of a balance about them it looked like more of a team playing out there they were just so much better so much organized and this time the individual brilliance of Cole Palmer he's he's a he's awakened he's grown into this game as it's gone on because he's been out of the game for vast majorities of it and these last five to ten minutes he's come alive just found that space found those opportunities and then in the big moment delivered the crucial skills and the crucial passes to get Chelsea in front so 17 minutes to play rail betis and now chasing the game and Chelsea are heading towards the first major trophy since the Champions League final of 2021 coming into this final had lost six of their previous eight major finals not in Europe though great record in the European finals Europa League win in 2019 Champions League win in 2021 six defeats have come in league cup finals and FA Cup finals and it could be a glorious end of the season here for Enzo Muresca and this young Chelsea squad into the Champions League next season and maybe about to add another trophy to the cabinet at Stamford Bridge as well and become the first team to win all four of UEFA's major knockout competitions in men's football. Matt Wake is looking to thread one through to Nicholas Jackson here's Jézus Rodriguez the 19 year old space opening up for rail betis four nows on the ball Anthony starts to make the run. Cucarera has dealt well with him so far tonight and Cucarera does so again Anthony runs just beyond the ball Chelsea have won it Cucarera plays down the left Quesado that is a poor pass has given it away and this goes got in space on the left hand side that is not what you want as a Chelsea fan back here pass looking for Rodriguez James Saw it has it covered has the ball for Chelsea down by the byline hits the clearance into Rodriguez and it's out for a Chelsea throw yeah good play again from Chelsea well hustled well defended some really nice little bit of play there obviously Cucarera gives away a really sloppy pass that's what creates this little bit of a sort of a half opportunity a dominance of play from from betis but then Rhys James gets across really well doesn't dive in it's just about positional play keeps his head keeps his calmness and that's what they've missed they didn't have that in the first half Chelsea they've got that now in the second half so far for the first time tonight the very first time tonight that is Chelsea singing that dominates this stadium Palmer forward to Jackson laid off to Maduakie blue shirts pouring forward Sancho in loads of space on the left hand side if they can see a Maduakie can't he tries to play it down the right it might still happen though because he's found Cole Palmer Palmer prods it back to Quesado here's Cole will cross the Chalabar third goal you think will definitely kill it Chalabar's pass intercepted by Jesus Rodriguez and goes out for a throw into Chelsea 15 minutes remaining Champions League final to come on Saturday live from Munich John Murray and Chris Sutton with the commentary of Inter Milan against Paris Saint Germain and we're at Wembley on Friday night as well for England's women against Portugal in the UEFA Nations League shouldn't forget as well Mark it's not gonna be that long until Chelsea are playing cup football again FIFA Club World Cup in the USA this summer first game in Atlanta on the 16th of June against Los Angeles FC or Club America it never stops no it doesn't it's uh it just comes thick and fast doesn't it for these players and it's just getting more and more that's the problem throw in for Betis comes back to Cardoso stunned by two Chelsea goals in five minutes here in Poland Natan the centre back goes wide to Perot Chelsea's substitutions Mark made a real difference positively Betis seem to have have lost a bit I think with with their changes yeah I've lost a little bit of momentum so far but that's because of Chelsea lifting their game because of that being so dominant and their substitutions have had such an impact and all obviously cold Palmer oh I'd say cold Palmer is back yeah we've not seen this celebration yet because he's not scored the goal but the two passes quite brilliant Isco trying to get onto a cross from Anthony headed away from him Chelsea have still got to concentrate here Sibali tackled by Cucarrea system referee says corner for Rael Betis suddenly explosion of noise away to our left Isco is going to take this quickly short to Anthony back to Isco inside the Chelsea box cutback looking for Cardoso brilliant from Jackson gets in the way and blocks it in Chelsea now streaking downfield Sancho releases Jackson and Jackson's away running from the halfway line Sancho to his right hand side oh the touch is awful the last touch is awful he knocks it straight into the arms of Adrian they were two on one against the goalkeeper that could have been the final right there no it had to be it had to be the final Nicholas Jackson did everything right defended brilliantly in his own box the breakaway the touch the movement in behind and then it was this what third touch massive touch Adrian just can it could have easily just laid a squid of Sancho Sancho was through could be the turning point in the game let's see what happens here four now's plays into Ruibao with the blue and pink hair number 24 on his back Jackson is down hurt just outside the rail bet his penalty area bet his attacking though away to our left Chelsea leading to one Anthony trying to make space for a shot scuffs it into the box Palmer clears it Chelsea would want to get this ball out of play it bounces inside the Chelsea half Natan wins the header it goes beyond Perot and runs to Jezus Rodriguez I think Jackson's game is over he may well have scored the winner in the UEFA conference league final Palmer tackles Isco referee then blows his whistle it's going to book Palmer for booting the ball away after the whistle gone no he's booking Palmer for for for giving the referee an earful right as he's claiming that part of that Jackson was down with a head injury the referee knew he wasn't down with a head injury Palmer was yelling at the referee and he finally wins the ball back and he boots it out in frustration but it's going out because he wants to stop the player that's when the referee gives him a yellow card possible hamstring injury for Nicholas Jackson here very much played his part in this second half heading in from the Palmer cross for the second goal Mark here is pointing the name of Ken and Dewsbury Hall who may be about to come on for Chelsea which is great for him because he's played such a massive part in the UEFA conference campaign for Chelsea this season and Jackson actually it came from that very last clumsy touch just watching the slow motion replay as he's racing through on goal there with Sancho on his right hand side that last touch of the ball is so heavy he's on his feet he's not pulled his hamstring there but he is not walking freely referee is walking him off the field behind the goal away to our right which he will enjoy because all the Chelsea fans are there ready to lord him for the goal he scored this evening Chelsea wait to make the change but we're looking at the moment Enzo Moresca talking to Cole Palmer I mean by his very high standards Mark he has had a relatively quiet second half to the season but with players like Palmer on occasions like this it's basically taken him five minutes to completely turn the game on his head it has yeah and that's the quality that you have in a play like that and that's what can happen and the question is you know for how long does it go on where it doesn't happen and tonight certainly in this in the second half he's been instrumental in this turnaround of the game obviously there's still time to go this is not done with as yet but the impact that Cole Palmer has had has been huge it's Mark Schwartz with us here in Poland you're listening to it on BBC Radio 5 Live possibly BBC Radio London tonight thank you for your company always available on the BBC Sounds app if you're on the move that is where you'll find all the reaction and analysis as well on the Football Daily podcast the 72 plus podcast up on the Football Daily feed at the moment as well with the end of season review from all the EFL football ladies fantasy 606 podcast season wrap-up is there will be recording the penultimate commentators view podcast of the season on Friday as well and our experiences in Poland here the last couple of days are bound to feature Tottenham have won the Europa League Chelsea are heading towards the Europa Conference League here and Betis with Rui Baal who goes down 10 yards outside the Chelsea penalty area looking for a free kick that they're never going to get and now Jorgensen has the ball at his feet and eventually picks it up as Rui Baal approaches but it looks like he's come on to try and just disrupt Chelsea hasn't he Rui Baal I mean he's running to Colwell there as he gets up and the referee's not giving a foul he's complaining of the referee gets up and as he's complaining of the referee he's still moving towards Jorgensen the goal and he runs in the Colwell in the back of him another test for this young Chelsea team about 10 minutes to go in a big final here they've turned it around they're leading 2-1 can they see it out under pressure can they go on and score this third goal they should have won it by now actually had it not been for the Jackson heavy touch they're on the attack again Jaden Sancho coming in from the left hand side just short of the penalty area lays it off to Fernandez Fernandez back to Quesado Quesado in the middle of the Betis half doesn't see an option being chased hard here by Isco and then f**ks the ball back into his own half curling pass to the goalkeeper Jorgensen he slips as he clears that's going to be easily controlled on the chest by Natan Natan inside his own half of Betis keeping an eye on the stopwatch all the time eight minutes plus added time remaining Chelsea heading towards a seventh major European trophy two in the Champions League one you wait for Cup one Europa League and two Cup winners cups as well this the Conference League final Jusbari Hall suddenly has space opening up in front of him still going for Chelsea left footed pass looking for Sancho ball finds him Sancho inside the area right footed oh finish what a goal that's going to win it for Chelsea what a way to do it Jaden Sancho rips off his shirt work the ball onto his right foot and curls it sweetly into the top corner rail Betis don't know what's hit them in this second half Chelsea's young guns have hit them it's rail Betis one Chelsea three absolutely brilliant goal from Jaden Sancho excuse me Hall's ball to him he's a little bit close to the defender but gets away Jaden Sancho just steadies himself takes a couple of touches steps over the ball then just picks a spot in that soft far right hand corner and curls it into what a brilliant finish and what a moment to score such a brilliant goal Jaden Sancho on loan from Manchester United for Chelsea in a European final all the subs still out there celebrating created by Keirnan Jusbari Hall rammed the ball forward got a little bit lucky with the pass but Sancho said thank you very much I'll do the rest perfect placement of the right footed shot and the Chelsea subs eventually making their way back across the field and back into the dugout very soon those players will be celebrating another European trophy such a brilliant finish from Jaden Sancho magnificent into that it's actually the side knitting a far post it's such a great strike goalkeeper no chance it goes around the defender clips the slightest of touch of the defender into the side knitting top left hand corner brilliant or top right hand corner from where we're seeing absolutely brilliant from Jaden Sancho before tonight you had to go back to 2001 for the last time that an English team an English men's team beat a Spanish team in a major European final that was Liverpool against Alves in the UEFA Cup 2001 Chelsea are going to break that hoodoo tonight last nine finals have been won by Spanish teams but Chelsea have turned this around in the second half Enzo Fernandez Cole Harmer creating the second goal for Nicholas Jackson and Jaden Sancho curling in a quite beautiful third double change made by Betis Pablo for now's one of the two players to come on La Celso from the top the man has come on and so has Sergei Altimira they've got to find two goals in a little over five minutes oh what a ball from Isco Jaden Rodriguez brings it down challenged by Rich James referee says no penalty scramble in the box and Philip Jorgensen just falls on the ball for Chelsea I tell you a better score now it's still going to be a very nervy finish I mean they're claiming a hand ball love to see the ball at the top is again brilliant from Cisco they're claiming a hand ball I don't think that's not a handball for me no there's no handball there we'll see it again on this angle oh here come Chelsea again looking for a fourth potentially no Fernandez stopped in his tracks on the halfway line Jaden Sancho of course given the yellow card for ripping his shirt off in celebration here's Isco for Ray or Betis can he make the magic happen to get them back in this game or this man Anthony tries to do a Sancho hits the left footer shot it is low and it is straight at Jorgensen and Anthony and the Rui Bao the two Betis teammates exchange words after that doesn't come off they're looking a beaten team at the moment four minutes left plus added time in the final Chelsea now leading 3-1 1-0 down the early goal from Abdei Palmer's brilliance though particularly to create the two goals for Chelsea in the space of five minutes and then the third the icing on the cake from Jaden Sancho wide on the left hand side passes back to Kukerea Kukerea across to James James feeds it to Chalabar challenged by Rui Bao fouled by Rui Bao on the halfway line another change coming for Chelsea Mark Guillieu 19 year old Spanish striker is coming on for Cole Palmer and as you'd expect from the Chelsea fans standing ovation from all of them for the man who's turned this final on its head high fives from Jusbury Hall from Noddy Madiwakey everyone recognizes the talent and Palmer slowly makes his way from the field knowing his job is done tonight rail betis won Chelsea three three minutes plus added time remaining Enzo Muresca wraps him up puts his right arm around his shoulder and I imagine says thank you very much indeed the ball is back with Jorgensen the Chelsea keeper high clearance away to the left controlled by Enzo Fernandez Fernandez and Quesado play the one to Anthony comes chasing back slides in catches Fernandez you heard the howl of pain from Fernandez Sancho stops the game so this teammate can receive treatment Anthony gets booked and time is running out for rail betis yeah it's a it's a it's definitely a foul obviously Fernandez goes down Anthony's a frustration there to dive out such an unique the follow through he gets him when there's nothing bad on it Anthony now is reminiscending with Fernandez I'll tell you what it'd be very lucky if he doesn't get sent off here yeah he's losing his head Anthony I mean he's been very poor tonight he looks like the player there was that Manchester now not the player that's been at betis since since January he's been a player that hasn't really been involved whatever he has been involved he's been he's been pretty poor words exchange between Anthony and Enzo Fernandez on the floor a couple of Chelsea players stepped in to try and break it up Fernandez reacted angrily Anthony is still losing his call here surrounded by the likes of Jake and Sancho reached James Marco Correa Qaisado comes in to calm it down as well tempers boiling over I mean by rights there's two yellow cards here which means Anthony gets a second second yellow card if the referee's gonna gonna call this yeah well let's see let's see what happened Anthony came to have a word Fernandez says something slaps his right arm away Anthony leans in then just knocks his forehead into the top of Fernandez's head he flicks out a right boot to try and retaliate so you're right either it's a yellow each or just let it go let's get this final finished it's just complete let it go isn't he the referee I mean they're still at it and the referee's just allowing it to happen 90th minute of the game betis fans some of them still singing their hearts out still beating the drums incredible run to the final for them but it is not going to be in their first major European final not going to be for Manuel Pellegrini he saw his team go one nil up early in the game have chances as well to get further ahead in the first half undone by Chelsea started this season as favorites for the competition and in this second half have eventually gone on to prove that Madiwaki back to Chalabar Chalabar quick clearance away laid off by Guyu towards Madiwaki couldn't quite get that ball down Natan Rodriguez lets it go runs to Perot challenge from Madiwaki it's out for a bet his throw they're really speeding through everything at the moment we are about to see how much added time we've got at the end of this final how far are we away from Chelsea winning the UEFA conference league seventh major European trophy ball controlled by Perot on the left gets the cross in header attempted by Rui Val didn't get a touch on it Kukere's clearance is blocked La Celso on the ball inside the Chelsea area looking for Sabali on the right hand side Kukere speeds in clearance hits Sabali runs to Sancho on the left five minutes of added time rail bet is the two goals in five minutes Chelsea need to see it out said he what they might fancy a fourth here Pinto Fernandez he'd love to score it edge of the penalty back to Kaisado one touch deflected shot finds the bottom corner Enzo Moresca leaps in the air in delight the Chelsea subs come flooding onto the field again and Chelsea celebrate a whopping win in the conference league final one nil down early on they've scored four in the second half Moises Kaisado with the fourth it's a Chelsea party in Poland rail bet is one Chelsea four now it's always a brilliant finish in the air we look bit fortunate with the with an affliction but the strike of the ball is excellent the movement down the left hand side from Chelsea is really good of course Benes had players push forward they were they were down on numbers but Chelsea exploited them I tell you what Nichols Jackson made a run across that pitch you would not believe it he came off limping there wasn't a limp inside he sprinted across the pitch Mark Schwartz watching the Chelsea celebrations inside the stadium celebrations of the players the coaching staff the fans lots of whom I mean just judging by some of the social media posts I said tonight you know just sort of posted mark we were here and advertising the commentary lots of Chelsea fans getting back in touch competition sort of beneath us who cares not a proper European competition it's a trophy oh it is course it is and it's a trophy for this this group of players that have won nothing so far for Chelsea Football Club so they've qualified for the Champions League which is great now this is their first step winning this trophy was I think is massive you can see that team you can see what it means to them how important this is to win it and obviously for the fans in the stadium and of course all the fans back at in in in England that Chelsea fans they'd be absolutely delighted with this. Isko brilliant in the first half for Rael Betis certainly feels sorry for him all his teammates all the Betis fans as well been torn apart in the end in his second half by Chelsea the ball now at the feet of Levi Colwell two and a half minutes to play two and a half minutes away from a first Chelsea trophy in four years and completing the set the only club so far to complete the set the four major UEFA club competitions this of course only the fourth edition of the conference league Chelsea subs dancing around on the side of the pitch waiting to run on to the field again in celebration Caesado to James looking for Jules Brijal the passes beyond him here comes Marc Bartra charging forward for Betis lines up the shot hits it well but wider the target goes wicking behind for the goal kick to Chelsea who leave Rael Betis by four goals to one. Yeah long way the top there was obviously a hit and hope for Betis I mean the game's done they've got no chance three goals in these last couple of minutes I don't see it happening Chelsea are going to see this out and in the end second half performance has been absolutely brilliant from them and they've first half was one that want to forget about but second half they've shown up and obviously all started by Colphama. You can see close-ups of Betis fans in tears one woman with a green and white Santa hat on but eyes streaming with tears the dream very much alive at halftime Chelsea have crushed it in the second half a minute until the celebrations can really begin and then maybe looking at another trophy this summer in the club world cup Madelweight he's still working hard for the team comes running back to win a tackle bodies everywhere referee gives the pre-kicking to Chelsea Perot then hits the ball after the whistle the blind apologizes quickly it smashes into the back of Chalabar I don't think that was deliberate he might have been whacking away in frustration he didn't aim that at Chalabar and luckily the Chelsea players have stepped in just to try and calm that situation down yeah it's one of those ones isn't it he hears that here's the whistle go there's no doubt about it at all and it's it's just a lash of the ball in frustration and it just smashes right into Trevor Chalabar could have easily have knocked him over fortunately enough I think he just turned out of the way in time Chelsea players all gathered already spraying each other with the water bottles the substitutes the players who played their part ready to come on like Nicholas Jackson Cole Palmer as well so instrumental in this win they're looking to soak Enzo Moresco as well and he's like a like a school teacher telling the new naughty pupils to calm down as the full-time whistle blows in Poland and the Chelsea subs come racing onto the field to celebrate they surround the likes of Mark Cugarea soak him with the water bottles I'm looking for Cole Palmer as well the man who made the real difference his last onto the field strolls on as cool as you like none of those celebrations for him but he made the real difference in this second half Chelsea one nil down at halftime turned it around initially with two goals in five minutes both created by the brilliance of Palmer the first the header prevents O'Fernandez then the real genius from Palmer the twist in the turn and the cross to find Nicholas Jackson the last two came from Jaden Sancho as sumptuous curler and Moises Kaisado at the end and Chelsea season ends in glory ends with silverware a first major trophy in four years a seventh major European trophy and incredibly seven out of eight wins in major European finals when it comes to big games like this they get the job done they've beaten Real Betis by four goals to one March Water yeah no it's thoroughly deserved I think first 45 minutes was one to forget for them a lot of possession too many mistakes Betis were good for their one nil lead at halftime Isco was brilliant and then it looked like it was a chance that just wasn't going to get any better for Chelsea the clear decision at halftime to make the sit bring on Rhys James take off Molo Gusto played dividends got more stability more calmness to the side experience the game changed and of course Cole Palmer came to life and that made a big difference as well he played his part and he was instrumental in those first two goals and then the end Chelsea ran away that could have won more comfortably as well next was Jackson through big touch other than that Chelsea thoroughly deserved to win this Chelsea have completed the set an historic achievement tonight whatever the Chelsea fans whatever anyone thinks about the UEFA conference league they've won the Champions League they've won the Europa League they've won the Cup winners cup and now tonight in Poland quite convincingly they have won the UEFA conference league they have beaten Real Betis by four goals to one much more reaction to come on five live to Chelsea's victory in the final of the conference league Tony lives he's taking over at 10 30 he'll be speaking to Chelsea fans tonight after 11 o'clock so Chelsea have won the conference league four won victors over Real Betis in the final Enzo Fernandez Nicholas Jackson Jadon Sancho Moises Kaysedo Cole Palmer with a couple of brilliant assists we've got Ali Bruce Ball and Mark Schwartz are inside the stadium Pat Nevin with us as well trophy lift on the way and just looking down at the pitch Ali the first thing I saw actually Real Betis players in tears yeah distraught I mean the support in this stadium for them tonight and actually the interaction now this is brilliant Steve from their fans who are just applauding and lauding their team for their efforts tonight the dream was on at halftime played really well in that first half and Chelsea was slightly out of sorts first ever major European final they really felt it was on and it hasn't quite happened for them tonight and the score line looks really bad on them in the end but they're chasing the game and Chelsea have that quality don't they to punish them but I think if you're a Real Betis fan I think you've really enjoyed the run in the competition this season because this isn't a club like Chelsea that spends lots of time in the upper echelons of European football which is why it would have meant so much for them to win it but I tell you what talking about what it means to Chelsea the huge contrast at the other end of the field as you can hear the song blasting out the entire Chelsea squad together linking arms bouncing up and down dancing away with those Chelsea fans and about to lift another trophy Mark Schwartz there's so many individuals that we can talk about and we will talk about as we review not just Chelsea's final victory but what comes next for them after this I feel like we've got to start with Cole Palmer because the two key goals were the equaliser and the goal to put Chelsea in front and they were more about the assist than anything else yeah they were the first one was an excellent crossing of the box perfectly weighted perfectly directed and Enzo Fernandez just running on the end of it all he needed to do was get a touch on it which he did of course he has to be there it's a great run but it's the ball isn't it it's the delivery in there and I'm pretty sure it was his first delivery into the box from open play Cole Palmer and it was a it was a fantastic ball and in the second one it just came from nothing Cole Palmer down the down the right hand side just playing with the youngster Rodriguez as he came on and then dropping the shoal and the turn and the ball into that near post area was excellent as well Jackson on the end of it I mean Chester in the end into the back of an air and that just changed the game it flipped it on his head and I think also the substitutions after that Cole Wall and Sancho coming on made a massive difference as well well Pat we were saying at halftime it looked pretty clear what Enzo Moresca needed to do but I still think we'll give him a lot of credit for doing it completely changed the game absolutely did um you'd have get some stick if he didn't do it it didn't work but yeah like it wasn't working for Gusto because he's not essential my field player just about a couple of minutes after the start of that second half don't you remember Beast James played a ball in from the right hand side he just got into that area knew how to play that area Chelsea didn't quite get on the end to it but the entire game had completely changed in that moment so there was much much more balance we changed what was better in that position and then of course the game starts to open up the other thing is Chelsea have more power more strength than the opposition and they were always going to be able to keep on going Chelsea are generally a better team in the second half lots and lots of 1v1s were interested tonight my favorite one of course was Esco versus Palmer Esco won the first half Palmer hammered the second half and those two are beautiful absolutely phenomenal Esco City got there would have absolutely fantastic so uh yeah Chelsea deserved it by a country mile in the end but they had to work for it but in the end it was a bit of a cruise and that's a bit of a relief because that's not hardly Chelsea off in this season Ali I was just looking at some of the the celebrations which are right in front of you there they're almost on three levels Nicholas Jackson going absolutely crazy in front of the Chelsea fans one level down Enzo Moresca dancing one level down Todd Bowley politely applauding yeah and Cole Palmer as well because none of that is sort of I mean he does get involved in a bit of it but when they all raced on at the full-time whistle just strolls on takes it all in you know it's it's it just seems what you know when he plays like that that that is his man he you know he's his pulse rate just seems so low he loves the big occasions he handles them so well I can see him now all his teammates sort of converting around him in fact he's being brought over here for a for a first post match interview but absolute magic in his boots tonight and I think I think Steve really really important win for this young squad as Marcus said and as Pat has said uh as well whatever you think about the competition you know this is a Chelsea squad that's been put together to try and achieve big things and try and build towards that and that's why having started the competition as big favourites quite rightly so they've hammered some teams on their way here but they've got the job done in the final he's getting the man of the match award isn't he Mark Cole Palmer yes he is yeah I said it in the match commentary Cole Palmer is back that's his celebrations that's him the way he played that second half absolutely brilliant he won man of the match and his last European final for Manchester City in the Super Cup as well I mean I know it's an easy thing to say Mark he is a man for the big occasion it that's just how it is yeah he has been he's delivered and that's the difference isn't it I mean Chelsea have had those plays in the past I mean I'm not trying to compare him with City A Drogba for example who would score every time on those big occasions but this is kind of moving along those lines someone like Cole Palmer they need someone to take over so they want to take the reins someone to direct this team this group of young players Cole Palmer's obviously a young player as well but he's got an incredible amount of maturity and the ability to deal with the the big the big uh you know I suppose stadium's the big occasions and that's what he's done tonight once again he's led this side and he's dictated that second half totally controlled it Pat yeah I mean I love watching him up back in the same way as Manchester City I thought Chelsea wouldn't watch when they got him and then amazed at this little period where he had a fade you know and he was disappearing out of games and the confidence that he shows seemed to evade him which is stunning to see because it must be in there somewhere but just recently you begin to see bits of it really coming back and if you look at these numbers at the end of the season they're not bad for a fifth sign there as well yeah right it's a big occasion and big moments and although the the first goal that he made for Enzo was a beautiful piece of work and they do work on it Enzo Fernandes coming from deep breaking the line there and he'll always find the pass because he is brilliant at that sort of thing and had the brain a sort of way however I thought I'm slightly biased towards the second assist being the jinky winger skills down the right hand side the way he's done it there and he right marks spot on he toyed with the lad that was trying to mark him he knew he was going to go buy him all along it was all about getting the ball into the area and it was such a good ball he didn't even need to hit it he goes to Jackson and it just comes off his chest because in the goal brilliant moment there Chelsea just gets stronger and stronger and that's maybe a metaphor for what's going to happen with these young players I'm looking at a lot of them and a lot of them are improving Enzo is improving Casado is improving and certainly Palmer can improve a lot Jackson we talked about before I think my last words before we went to the commentary to start he should be the man tonight well it's got the goal that got got him to one but I think we'll all agree that Palmer was actually the man who did it in the end but you can see it's beginning to happen for a group of those Chelsea players I don't think it's the finished article yet but you can see the direction I also think there's a balance there's a balance of the team wasn't right until Reese James came on Colwell came on and then James Sanchez there was a better balance and I think I also think Col Palmer then changed the way he played a bit he actually was looking to for those runs I think Fernandez had an opportunity running in the box which he did I think it's the different balance of the side when that happened Madiwiki came on the right hand side I thought Neto wasn't really in the game tonight really struggled to make an impact I thought there were two individual at times but when those substitutions were made they actually played far better as a unit and that made all the difference in the second half the second assist that Pat is is waxing lyrical about there was an absolute joy to watch in the stadium tonight that's sort of toying with the 19 year old Rodriguez it reminded me a little bit do you remember Messi creating that goal in the World Cup semi-final against Croatia when I think he scored Guardiola but from deeper didn't he down you know sort of twisted and turned him and then and then created that brilliant goal for Argentina it was just like that it was just like I am taking control of this and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it and what I'm really hoping Steve is that the shirt swap that happens tonight is Palmer and Isco because I think both of those would look at those shirts and remember that final and think yeah he did all right you know what Pat I think now is the time for a mention for Moises Caesado and I'll tell you why he is Chelsea's player of the season right and Col Palmer is the reason probably they've won this final tonight but also they've needed players like Caesado to be eight out of ten every week for him to get the goal and make that his third goal in his 103rd game for Chelsea that felt quite quite right I think yeah does the airman know about as well it's strange with Caesado because he stuck him at right back a couple of times and honestly it was awful just wasn't working at all but it was desperate you could see how angry he was he's kicking everything and moved now he does like a wee kicking a wee nip and down again but his energy levels they do remind you of an Angola can't he different type of player but the energy levels are fantastic and when you see his goal have a look at it again and it gets it's actually him that makes the break he gets away he passes it away but he doesn't serve yeah he's easy to put behind my field up he's not sitting at that point in time and when there's been times of season where you get the last 20 minutes of games and everyone's tiring and he is actually getting stronger so yeah very very important. Ali it's time very nearly time for the rail bettis players to make one of the worst walks in football. Yeah it is they're still gathered around the edge of the penalty area away to our left in front of their brilliant fans in fact some of those fans have now made their way out of the stadium they can't bear to watch this this bit the Chelsea players credit to them have made this this tunnel lined up facing each other creating a tunnel to applaud the rail bettis players Tempers did flair towards the end of the game it was a keenly contested final luckily nothing boiled over between Anthony and Enzo Fernandez right at the end the officials have now received their medals everything's decked out this sort of stage here is is decked out in black with green trim and the UEFA conference league trophy is standing on a on a tall glass plinth very similar to the Europa League trophy the UEFA Cup that that sort of vase shape shiny silver gleaming under the floodlights tonight and it looks like it's sort of got that that bit of sort of gold inside it as well from up here a bit like when they opened the briefcase in pulp fiction never quite see what's in there there's just that that shining gold inside the trophy and the bettis players Steve about to make their way through this this tunnel of Chelsea players applauding their beaten opponents and Mark Schwartz you've done this walk twice and and actually I'm sure you can really feel how they must be feeling the bettis players because both of the teams you made that walk with sort of knew they weren't going to be in European finals all that often yeah that's right um it's still tough though it doesn't matter it doesn't matter when you're in a final yeah yeah absolutely want to win it and and it hurts like anything um to to lose the final yeah it brings back a lot of memories from that but you've got a lot of the bigger pitch and I think bettis down the line will will look back at this moment you know an incredible run an incredible journey and possibly you know not expected for them to reach a final like this it was the same when I was with Middlesbrough in Fulham you know nobody expected us to get to a Euro or UEFA Cup and then a Europa League final and we did so in hindsight it's a great achievement but most of the time people don't remember who lost to anyone or the winners yeah they give it a right good go pat didn't they they did um particularly in the first half but that energy level that they showed at the start you know really pressing high up the pitch etc and I'm thinking can you keep that up I'm not sure you can and absolutely couldn't and for all we love Esco and what he did he's not that type of player and if you're going to do that sort of um pressing against a team that's young and fit you can't do it with nine you can't do it with ten you need to do it with them all every single player has to be up for it uh so they give it their best shot um and held on for a good long period of time but I'll be honest with you before we lost their first goal I thought they'd lost it I thought Chelsea had completely taken control and just as Mark was saying they have the changes they've made the difference but also the physicality they've made the difference as well and that maturity we were talking about before the game it's really beginning to show through now really really tough for the rail bettors players walking down the lines lots of emotion probably five or six players at least maybe more have been in tears since the full-time whistle and they're all just walking past that trophy and most of them are trying not to look at it but now it's Chelsea's moment Ali winners medals here they come first to get it is Enzo Moresca the U.A. for president Alexander Severin the last in line hangs the medal around the Chelsea manager's neck he turns spots someone in the stands that he knows gives them a double wave with both hands and the Chelsea players now tired after the exertions tonight but a spring in the step another trophy in the cabinet and they bounce their way along that platform to collect the medals and then line themselves up on a green bit of carpet to the left of this main stage where Reese James will eventually collect that trophy bring it across the fireworks will go the confetti will fly and Chelsea will celebrate their win tonight Manuel Pellegrini was up first for Real Betis I saw Risco next after him have a last longing look at the trophy that could have been Cole Palmer just goes strolling past that conference league trophy on his left he doesn't seem too fussed about that having a chat with his teammates not him out of WAKE does the same Mark Kukerea follows and we're getting to the point where Reese James will get the medal Enzo Fernandez team captain tonight high five for him medal is hung around his neck trophies stands tall above him in this stadium in Poland and then a word with Reese James who says thank you and gets to do what he will always have wanted to do for Chelsea get his hands on a trophy as the captain holds it in both hands brings it in front of his teammates raises it to the sky as the golden confetti blows out of the cannons behind the Chelsea players and the season for Chelsea ends in glory UEFA conference league winners the fourth winners of this trophy after Roma West Ham two seasons ago Olympia across last season and now Chelsea they will play in the Champions League next season which is where they feel they belong they were under pressure against rail betties tonight but four goals in the second half they cruise the competition and they cruise the final in the end and eventually like shimmering glitter in the air still falling we can finally see the Chelsea players behind it and Mark Schwartzer each player now getting their turn to take the trophy and raise it high to the cheers of their teammates yeah that's what it's about isn't it it's about creating that bond that experience of winning a trophy what it means to these group of players to the club and I think it's really important that they've uh they've done the job they've matured they deserve to win the game and it's something they can take back to and it's that starting point we talked about before the game four players for Champions League now win this trophy and this could be the start of something for Chelsea the glitter tonight Steve the confetti is like hanging in the air all that select a TV image but it's it's like sort of golden snow kind of hanging in the air and all the confetti on the pitch quite a senior Pat Nevin you know how people have looked at this Chelsea squad over the last few years and they've talked rightly about how much it's cost and there have been lots of discussions over the years about how unbalanced it's become well looking at those pictures looking at those players that is a team now very good point it does look like a team it looks like a group that's going to work together I have to say it didn't for a long time and it was it seemed as if it is a massive big net thrown out wide and caught lots of fish and they might actually get to know each other after a wee while um but you didn't see it happening for a good long time but slowly but surely it's been put together this season certainly near the end of it you can see the sense of it I mean hey there's a lot being lost on the way I mean they spent a lot of money and a lot of players that ain't worked in any way whatsoever but maybe that's what was always part of the time the understanding there would be failures as long as it was enough positives particularly a young among the young ones to go forward and but you also have to get a magic to bring it all together and then I'm watching some pictures there Kukareela he's playing to be honest a lot of people would have got rid of him you know a lot of people didn't like him he's been one of the most important players of the team we had a chat beforehand about Anthony and I said to you I wouldn't play Anthony against him because Anthony won't get a touch didn't did he nope he'd never get a sniff because that's not out there and he should have been moved over the other side but the point is when Esca knew he kept up he so he's he's learning as manager he's going forward the team as a group are going forward they will buy over the summer where they are weak so yeah the plan is it is it's not a quick one but it still seems untrack as we're looking at it right now we will definitely get into the where are they weak and where might they buy and who's celebrating down on that pitch might not necessarily be in a Chelsea shirt next season before we do that Mike Schwartz you used the word there as you were discussing the trophy lift it's a bond isn't it you win something together you've been there it bonds you yeah it does and I think that's really important for this group of players off the back of finishing fourth in the Premier League qualified in Champions League now in that they're in their first European final as this group of players this next generation this this project and they've delivered so okay it's the third ranked European trophy but it's a trophy a final that they were in they needed to win to take that next step now they're going opportunity to move on from it and it's great for them they can celebrate they can enjoy this moment but no there's a big they're a far bigger challenge ahead and what Chelsea need to do to get to where they were before there's still a long way to go but this is the beginning I feel like Ali they've got like a UEFA playlist for trophies because they add in the odds one which is club specific by pursuing the women's Champions League final at the weekend these are all the same songs where's Suggs Chelsea won a trophy yeah well one step beyond has gone down very well with the Chelsea fans here Enzo Moresca very insistent as soon as they've sort of done those celebrations with the confetti flying that they go round sort of every part of this ground with the Chelsea fans are to celebrate with them and you know that was interesting as well Steve to watch tonight like we were saying right at the start of the night the sort of feeling you were getting from both sets of fans and how important it was to rail Betis and what a big night it was for them and then gradually they sort of went quieter and quieter as Chelsea took control of the game and they're celebrating wildly tonight but I just think the winning a trophy is is a big deal whenever you do it but I just think so important for this young group of players who they expect so much right I just think it's a major step forward step beyond step forward for the club champions league football plus the trophy who knows what's going to happen in the club world cup and that that that you know five wins in the last six Premier League games when champions league qualification wasn't assured and the win in this as well that that is some end to the season they've already timed that run well that'll be sucks then isn't it what have we got here there you go Steve I knew it was in the past Chelsea fans loving it 1997 FA Cup final song tattooed on my brain believe me um what about that next step then Pat they've got this young group they've bonded them together so presumably that means you've got to keep that group together and only make finite changes and I think you need to make a law um but the changes in the winter aren't playing there's a lot of squad players there and and we know what it's all about now it's all about money and make sure you use it the right ways so there's a good number of players that will be moved on that are not absolutely integral to the group and if they make enough money out of them and add on the champions league money that's coming in as well then you can look at them all sent a forward to help you know the man Jackson there who's been on his own and the only one who's a national centre followed up there who they trust because they don't trust and come to absolutely no chance and then you'll take the other areas I mean do you feel as if you've got enough strength and depth in the centre backstreet get rid of one or two of the four or five you've got and bring in another one who actually is young but also improving as well I think they will probably do that I think central midfield they're absolutely fine maybe the only areas is that right back area I mean we've changed come on and did a great job today um but he doesn't seem absolutely convinced in that area and then there's a goalkeeper as well now that seems a lot for the team that's out there celebrating winning a cup but there's still a big there's a long way to go there's a big big jump between winning the third tier trophy and getting back to where Chelsea were four or five six years ago so yeah they've got things to do the thing is they'll look as if they've got the money to do it and the finances as they are it would seem if they use these sales wisely it could work and I think Chelsea fans can be it can rightly be pretty excited because the fourth is what they've got this season after what someone thought was an average season why not expect more and then you know where the strengths where they have to be strengthened and actually there's some possessions I don't think it's that definitely strengthening for sir going off a bit Ali isn't it just lining themselves up for a team photo now which is going to look fantastic so many clubs do this now don't they Steve but they position themselves in the penalty area way to our right to get that photo with that wall of flu all the Chelsea fans celebrating behind them I mean mark made the point in the second half Nicholas Jackson came off with what we thought was a hamstring problem he has been flying here there and everywhere he's the one who looks like he's going to be the real party animal tonight but that that's that's just scenes of unbridled joy that is a long run in the competition real squad effort as well Steve you think about all the different players that have played for Chelsea in the competition and the miles they've done competition they didn't necessarily want to be in but they've done it they've gone there and won it achieved something and no other club has done in terms of adding that trophy you know in terms of the European trophy so the list of trophies that they've won and given these Chelsea fans in Poland a great night tonight leave I call will speak into TV and reach James let's just read what they've been saying call will it's great to be the first club to win everything possible shows how much it means to the fans talked about coming off the bench I feel like watching from the bench you can see the spaces on the pitch you can see how you can help the team that's what I did when I came on the pitch I could see the gaps reach James it's a great feeling we knew it would be a tough game as it went on we grew into it at devastates devastating when you know you're not playing in a final I want to play every game it's the manager's decision and higher to take the opportunity when it came up and you know what Mark I think reach James is well worth talking about here because there are players within this Chelsea group that you think are they good enough to be part of the Chelsea team at the next step back in the Champions League there isn't that question mark on reach James his issues have been elsewhere haven't they they have been and that's that's why there's questions the questions are is he able to is he physically able to compete you know will his body hold up and he you know went through that horrendous period of injuries and the question was going to be will he come back from it will he be able to get back to the reach James that we we'd seen before and the reason why Chelsea you know were you know game a long-term contract and you know so highly regarded way play for England and we're slowly seeing it and I think there's also element of also still managing him in terms of games played trying to make sure they don't overload him I mean you saw at half time I think he made a massive difference when he came on was it it was I think it was very obvious he just was there was an enormous amount of calmness grinning in the game no no no diving in it and his and his ability on the ball Pat talked about it a little bit afterwards as well about the that first cross into the box where he's just slightly maybe a little bit too heavy on the cross but the perfect distance it was a rangefinder for for Cole Palmer he clocked in on it and that was the one that they went in there and it was a great delivery in there and so Fernandez but I think it's really key to have someone like Reese James at the club he knows the club he's come through the ranks and he's a guy that I think if they can keep fit he can lead this team further and further forward and in the direction where they they should be do you know one thing I would say about Chelsea just now looking at the way they are even those who are not very keen on Chelsea you don't think they'll be washed next year you think they'll probably be as good as they are probably better and that is a really major thing when you're going forward because the young players are actually maturing together they're getting better they're understanding the game better and they're believing in themselves and you know they're going to add to it as well so that's that's something you want going forward it's an easy phrase to say but does that team look as if it's going to suddenly fall apart actually no that looks like a group is going to grow and that's a really interesting thing but I keep on underlining it it's as does Mark third level trophy in Europe we're not talking about winning the Champions League yet there are many many giant steps to make but you look as if they're still making those steps upwards and do you know what Mark I think that's why this conversation is different to pretty much any other cup final I can remember doing because normally the game finishes you talk about the key players what next for them what difference tonight might make well let's look at someone like Jaden Sancho scored a great goal in a European final I doubt that's going to change what Chelsea decide to do with him this summer is it yep possibly not um yeah I mean he's a bit of a normally he's struggled for game time for one reason or another um he's a player that I think everybody knows has incredible amount of capability it's just trying to to tap into it I mean he's proven it when he played for Dortmund that he can do it for a sustained period of time it didn't work out at United he's been hit and miss with Chelsea um the question is do they keep him I mean I know that I think there are blights now to buy in but they can there is a get out but it's still going to cost him a little bit so only time will tell what happens to Jaden Sancho but I still think there is a really good player in there he's just got to find his place um and and uh there's a there's a whole list of players that you can go through yeah I mean there are so many players at Chelsea that I mean you look at Joel Felix is coming back I mean if you look at him you think well there's no place for him in this team how is he even going to fit in anywhere he just doesn't really suit the way they play either so um yeah I mean the list goes on I mean this is a discussion I think we can go for hours and we haven't even mentioned Nicholas Jackson yet Pat who's obviously uh paired off that debt that was mentioned but I think there's a what's next question for for him as well do you think he's the man to be Chelsea's lead striker in a Champions League campaign he will be at Chelsea next season yeah um he is getting better I think he's had an effect this season this season because of the injuries um yeah he's still young he's still growing up people often down at Chelsea they often talk about does anyone really remember that first period of DDA drug bar wasn't it that great really wasn't and then he grew and grew and got better and better so if they believe in his abilities and all the the raw data is there for Jackson the running the moves the pace all it's all there it all works for him whether you can trust in him being the one that will do it on his own as the single centre forward to get you all the the latter stages of the Champions League no he's not he's not at that standard yet he may become that standard over the next few years but he's not at that standard yet that's why I say they do need another striker and I think there are many looking that's why they talk about the likes of Dilap et cetera they do need somebody else to spell it with him because as we seen tonight that chance he had at the end when he sprinted away and then the gasket was completely blown before he quite got to the 18 yaddling so no there's more needed than Jackson but he's a big partner let's finish with proper big picture Enzo Moresca Ali he looks like he's had a whale of a time down there I didn't know he could smile well I mean Steve look you mentioned this in the build-up in terms I mean just talking about what we're talking about there in terms of what's going to go on this summer and all the players coming back at everyone in this squad you have to say real credit to him for steering this shit this season and picking the players for certain competitions and keeping them motivated and keeping everything on track and you know at Christmas time we were talking about then potentially pushing for the Premier League title that fell away pretty quickly but as I say finishing the season strongly to get the Champions League football and winning the trophy managing Chelsea and and all these players and all these young players as well youngest average age in the Premier League is not an easy job and he's had a fair bit of stick of Chelsea fans as well even towards the end of the season we were talking about me about the the performance at Fulham a game they eventually won when he was taking a load of sticks so he can feel well satisfied I think Steve with the job he has done at Chelsea this season. Yeah Mark if you can have a style of football that people don't love you've got to win and Enzo Moresca's won. Yeah they do and I think maybe it's a case of also him learning on the way to maybe be a little bit flexible maybe a little bit of an adaption maybe be a little bit pragmatic sometimes rather than overplay look I think they're not there were times in the game they overplayed a little bit but overall I thought they got the balance pretty well certainly in the second half and I think you know ultimately you're right winning games getting results winning games achieving things winning trophies is what keeps people on side and I think for for the manager it's so important that he keeps doing that and I agree well he's saying I think he managed this squad this club really really well this season for him the reason I think he's got a massive smile on his face is that Champions League tick winning the trophy that he said was the most important and the biggest trove biggest tournament for them this season the confidence done tick so he's done it he's delivered the trophy he's won he's gone into Champions League and everything has sort of fallen into place for him his plan could some things have gone better of course but then overall the grand plan that I think he had has worked final thoughts Pat um Chelsea look stronger Chelsea are getting better Chelsea are becoming more mature and they will strengthen but it will come down to two words for next season I think Cole Palmer getting back to where he was the season before Chelsea will have a cracker all right Pat thank you very much Ali Mark great stuff inside the stadium and that's it now for Chelsea season the players can go and have a good long rest and then in 19 days the club world cup starts",
