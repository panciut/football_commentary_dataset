  "transcript": " For these two sides, the knockout stage, you start now. Yep, losing your out. And it's brilliant how it's worked out in both the groups today. We've got games of real jeopardy. Ones where you've got contrast in styles, teams with different expectations. But there's a real flavour in the stadium, a real atmosphere. Certainly Senegal can't rely on a draw. They can't rely for what would be more than a minor miracle for Qatar to upset the Netherlands. So they've got to go for the win. And to the beat of the drum. In what is a lively atmosphere here inside the Khalifa International Stadium, you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live with Ecuador in their yellow shirts and navy shorts playing from right to left as we look against Senegal. The African Cup of Nations champions all in white. As the ball is headed away by Kula Ballet. But straight away, it was picked up by Plata. That came to a shuttering halt as the ball is played out towards that far side. And Jakobs the left back will play the ball forward. It's been a while for both of these two nations where they've reached the latter stages of the World Cup. Ecuador 2006 in Germany. And who will ever forget Senegal's run to the quarterfinals in 2002? But first of all, they've got to overcome this final. 90 minutes in the group stages. It's day 10 of the World Cup as the ball is played out to this left-hand side. And it's kept in play by Valencia. But it's the first day of the final round of group games. And Ecuador, who was robbed quite rightly says, has certainly caught the eye as it will be a throw on this left-hand side, Estupena. And they go back now to Felix Torres. And then across the back to Incafé. And the ball is switched out towards the right-hand side and the header forward should be dealt with. And in fact, it will roll out of play for a goal kick. So how have that match between the Netherlands and Qatar started, Masferuki? Goalist at the moment, Ian, but a chance for the Dutch, almost from kickoff, long ball over the top. And Virgil van Duits is just too heavy for Memphis to tie. Niel Niel, as it stands, very early stages, but Netherlands going through at the moment. Yep, and we're expecting not that really two-wetter change. That would certainly constitute a major upset if Qatar were to stumb the Dutch. Niel Niel in the early stages, two and a half minutes played. I swear those drums are getting louder. Cross from the left-hand side. And there's an opportunity here for Senegal, and it's flash wide. Latching onto it was... Adrissa Gay coming forward from midfield, edge of the area, right-footed shot. Couldn't get it on target, goal kick. That's a huge opportunity early in the game. One that... All the players, they want it to fall to. Adrissa Gay. Just his touch forced him wide, but before that, just great play down the left-hand side. No real messing about. Just played it forward, good control, then a square ball into the penalty area. Found all the space at the far post. His touch took him wide and drilled it wide, but... You just see, if he can go forward early, there can't be an invited to do so by Ecuador. If they do, they do get the opportunities, they are there. Still Niel Niel, but Adrissa Gay, who moves alongside Henri Cameron as the joint appearance-maker for Senegal, with his 99th appearance as the keeper, races out Galindes on that far side, and it was offside anyway. But he wasn't to know that. He had out of his penalty area towards the right, and he had to make sure that he got there first, because otherwise, there'd have been the potential break-on for Senegal. I think it was Ismail Assar, wasn't it? He would have been away on that left-hand side. And this is the one argument that you have with the delaying of the flag. I understand why, but, as you say, Galindes, can hair and out his goal, sliding tackle, goalkeeper's tackling, always potential for injury there, and I just feel that if the flag goes up, because it's clearly offside, just put the flag up, any peril is taken out the situation. Estapinian, away from Anjai, and then gets the ball forward to Valencia, staying out on this near side to the left, five minutes played, and then the ball is played back in Capierre. Now with Felix Torres, his forward ball, looking to try and turn there in the midfield, but Ecuador have actually given it away. Here is Jar, big, powerful striker. Saw him play in the Champions League for Virial against Liverpool, now playing his football in Italy, but he will make his presence felt. Just seeing tactically the back-four of Senegal, they're so tight together when they get compact, that the Ecuadorian players have just looked up, they just thought, second-guests themselves, that's when they get caught in possession. They want to go forward, they want to go forward fast and early. When they doubt themselves, they lose it. The Chelsea connection there was found wanting Culebally with the ball back to his goalkeeper, Edward Mendy, and Mendy did well to actually keep the ball in play, preventing it from going out for a corner kick, but it was then out for an Ecuadorian throw on this near side. Here is Quesido over the halfway line. All they have to do is avoid defeat Ecuador. That's the key permeation that you need to remember as far as this group game is concerned. And Jai nicks it away from his marker on this right-hand side, rolls an inviting ball in, and actually it was an outstretched right foot from Felix Torres that guided the ball back towards his goalkeeper, because in Capge was struggling there against the Sheffield United player. Nothing of the teams actually want the ball. Both teams are narrow, sat tight, saying, OK, you can have it, we'll hit you on the counterattack. Both teams want a counterattack. They don't want to be playing this football. They don't want to stay there because they have to open up. They have to leave themselves exposed. Elimin Jai is playing on the right of the three. Jai is through the middle, and Ismail Asar is out on the left-hand side. We talk about him making his debut for Hyde United in the Northern Premier League two years ago. He was raised just outside of Paris, played a lot of lower league football in France, moved to Senegal, then came to London. Sheffield United actually signed him from Borum what only three years ago. It's an incredible story. And here he is, starting a game in the World Cup finals and hoping to have a telling contribution for Senegal. Mill-nil, seven minutes played on BBC Radio 5 Live. On the right-hand side, having a chat with the manager. How do we see say? Real meteoric rise, isn't it? You say, looking at the opportunity here. A wonderful opportunity to be a national hero. Yes. As it's now out with Savalli on this near side, the right, he'll go infield. An opportunity now for Cease in the midfield for Senegal. Chip forward. Senegal are attacking. That was a sharp turn. Ball played forward to Jarny. Hits it first time right footed. Inside right, channel the penalty area. Senegal are playing from left to right. And he's just pulled it across the face of goal, out for a goal kick. Another massive chance. And you've got to hit the target. It's really good play. Simple ball forward. Then one touch football from there, well timed run. He's through, he's on the angle, he's waiting for the ball, he's waiting for the strike. Just had to wait a little bit too long. Drag to shot across, but again, another massive chance. And it's not when they play too many passes, they just keep it simple and go forward. He scored against Liverpool in that Champions League semi-final, where Liverpool eventually ran out five to two winners on aggregate. He threw two ball actually when he was on loan there for the Yellow Submarine. Six goals in 14. And now he's looking to try and sink those players who are wearing yellow of Ecuador, who have got an opportunity to come forward now. There's a Clément Turpan, the French referee, will give a free kick as there was a foul in the middle of the park. And it was Casino who was fouled central area now for Ecuador. But it's a long way out. Must be at least 35 yards out from goal. He fancies it. Valencia has picked up the ball, can't jog in over, said I'll have this and he's teed it up, especially how he wants the ball with the foul facing him. Expect a knuckleball. Well, you're right, the 33-year-old is certainly full of confidence on the scoring run that he's on, but it's a central position. And it's a good 35 yards out from goal. But he's taken a good five, six, seven steps back. And any Valencia is going to let one rip. Senegal have got everybody back. Valencia from long range, canons away off one of the Ecuadorian players, out towards the far side, cross comes in from the right, back towards Valencia, takes another deflection, and it's saved by Mendy away towards our left-hand side, nil-nil. Hit the second one better than they hit the first one, actually blocked by his teammate Estrada inside the penalty area. And Jaik, sent away by Sabali on the right-hand side, it's a good ball in and it's just touched back by Preciado on the far side, turning it to safety for a corner kick. It's a devilish ball in, wasn't it, first time from the right for Senegal? They can't handle him down this, right? They've, his opinion, he's struggling, left him in his weight there, tracking back. It's a fantastic ball flashing across the six yard box. Three chances now. Now look back at this opening, 15 minutes. Senegal have made a decent start, nil-nil, corner kick. Idris Agay to take it, Galindes with the punch away, fired back in on this occasion, but blocked, goes out towards that far side. And Idris Agay scuffs his attempted cross from the left. And there is an opportunity now to clear the ball away for... Ecuador. And then it's Edward Mendy to play it forward to Diallo. Taking over now in the midfield. Then it'll go back, actually, to Edward Mendy. Hits it. Up towards Ismail Al-Assad. Jarr is actually going to make a run out towards that left corner. He's done well to keep it alive. Block, challenge came in from Torres. Ball played back, though, for Senegal, and now switched out to Ceballi on this near side, the right. Midway through the Ecuadorian half, a little flick header. Freciado actually did well on the cover, and Jai goes for a curler. Left-footed, just wouldn't curl enough from the inside-right channel on the edge of the area, out for a goal kick, Rob Green. He has really good from Senegal, good switcher play, good movement off the ball from midfield, running from Idris Agay. And his compatriots, he's just looking at that final finish initially. But before that, because of the tactics, because they are matching up 4-3-3 both teams, they're getting into isolated positions. They're actually winning their individual battles right now, so they're getting the better of the game. The beat of the drum from the Senegalese support will tell you that they are still very much alive as far as qualification is concerned. The Dutch elsewhere in Group A are taking on Qatar. Masparuki's watching. 13 minutes played, still no-nil Netherlands, though camped out in Qatar's box. De Jong is seeing so much of the ball done, Frecius blasted well over the ball bar as well from the edge of the box, but the Dutch goal does feel like it's coming as it stands. The Netherlands are going through to the last 16. The Netherlands were top of Group A. They will take on the runners-up of that England-Wales group, Group B, where Wales need to beat England and hope that Iran, the United States, ends in a draw. Commentary of that from 7 o'clock, but all the build-up on BBC Radio 5 Live after this game as the cross comes in. Enne Valencia trying to keep it alive as he was making a little darting run in from the left-hand side of the penalty area, bounced away off his knees. Mark Chapman, John Murray, Matt Upsson, Micah Rich, it's all part of our team a little later on, and it is on BBC One as well, so you can watch and listen through the iPlayer. Here is Engeido for Senegal on this near side, the right. He's away from two challenges to address a game, to come forward. Just to his left is Papagay, out to star, back forward to Papagay with the cross in towards the near close, saved by Galindes. They're certainly creating a number of opportunities, Rob Green. Yeah, the combinations out wide once they do get it out there, because they could all want to come narrow. They don't want to get dragged out there. They've got the space initially to the receive the ball, but they've got the support as well. They've not got their players out there on their own. Papagay's covered some yards already, looks like he's blowing. Missing, of course, the African player of the year, Sadia Mane, what a blow that really was to the Senegal hopes in the build-up to the tournament, as it's a head-of-forward by Cease in the midfield there for Senegal. They want to take the throw, the free kick rather, midway through their own half, but Ecuador slowly piling back in their yellow shirt. Senegal all in white, playing from left to right, we've been playing for a quarter of an hour. As it stands, it would be the Netherlands going through as group winners with Ecuador as runners-up. This is Ecuador's first-ever World Cup match against African opposition. When they've met before, though, in two friendlies, Senegal have prevailed on both occasions. 2002, again, Alias Cease, their coach, actually played in, winning by a goal to nil and three years later, in another friendly Senegal triumphed by two goals to one. If it's third time lucky, then they're into the knockout stages. Just look at the shape of Ecuador. They're so narrow in the 4-3-3 formation. This amount of start, at one point there, was the only player on the far side of the pitch. They get the switch-off. Certainly the space for him to gallop into. He's got the space, he's got the skill. Here in the midfield is Cease for Senegal. He finds Idrissa Gay. Gay can run forward. It's a right-footed cross. It's a powerful one, and then try to control that with his arm. With Ismail Assar and it will go out of play. It will be a free kick to Ecuador. Not only are we live on 5 Live and the BBC sounds out, but also a big hello to the World Service across Africa. Wherever you are, it's always a pleasure to have your company. I had a very pleasurable experience to Sally in Senegal in 2003. We're on that occasion. The Jambars Academy was launched, I remember, quite vividly in the barren wastelands of Patrick Vieira, laying down the first stone for the Jambars Academy. Certainly so many players blossomed when Senegal reached the Olympics in 2012. I noticed that Patsy say here in the midfield, he started through the Jambars Academy. Another player is also on the bench in Bamba D'Ang. If you're in that part of Senegal, a warm welcome to you as well, listening to our coverage on the World Service. It's 0-0, just in case you have joined us. We've been playing for 17 minutes, and Senegal have made a bright start. They are probably carrying the greater threat, and they've got a corner kick on this right-hand side. Trotting across to take it is going to be Ismail Jacobs. The left back, so because it's on the right, this should be an in-sringer. Ecuador have every yellow shirt back in and around the penalty area. The referee, Clemente Pant, from France, is just making sure these... Having a word with Felix Torres, and Coulou Ballet is also making his presence felt. So a corner kick for Senegal, it's 0-0. The right arm goes a lot from Jacobs. Hits it, left foot in. Gelindes the keeper, punches the ball away. It's a bouncing ball that, waiting for it to drop, was Papagay. A little bit of hesitation has allowed a potential break now here for Ecuador, streaking away on the right-hand side. The ball goes in field, and it was looking for the run of Carlos Gruesso. But Senegal quickly had enough white shirts to snuff out that counterattack from Ecuador. It's on an eye-fager, and it went when either team lose the ball. So fast on the counterattack there, Ecuador, they're away. Covered the length of the pitch almost in a matter of seconds, but Senegal can do the same. A little whether you want to join in, but we've got an Ecuadorian TV crew away towards our right-hand side. And one of the gentlemen has just been shaking his shoulders to the beat of the drum. They've managed to put the drums right next to the commentary section, which is handy. I'm just wondering if that's why producer George's knee keeps on going as well. There's a player down on the far side for Ecuador, Presiado, who's finally just picked up a dead leg. So the treatment is going to be on. We're going to have a stoppage in play here at 0-0-5 live. It's an opportunity here for Ecuador just to really check themselves at the moment. It's not quite working the shape, they're being played through very, very easily, and also being played around as well. So it's a combination from Senegal that they've got going at the moment. When they want to go long, when they want to go fast, they can do, but when they want to control it and play through, which I did think, they'd be able to at the start they are doing. So a lengthy stoppage this for Presiado. Let's get an update on the other game in Group A, Netherlands against Qatar, Masfuruqi. 20 minutes gone at the out-bait stadium, still the Netherlands 0-0, Qatar 0-0, another good chance for the Dutch though, De Pye with the attempted bicycle kickoff with De Jong's strike from the Deans, blocked by Klassen. Still goalless, but the Netherlands top Group A on five points at the moment. And I mentioned as well later on for the Wales-England game that you can watch and listen through the BBC television. Tomorrow is the conclusion for Group C and the Dignumon for Group D. Tunisia France will be on BBC One at 2.30, Australia, Denmark, BBC Two at 2.45, and we will have those games for you, Group D, on BBC Radio 5 Live. Tunisia France, Australia, Denmark, and then at seven o'clock tomorrow night, we'll have Poland, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. I'm not too sure that Presiado is able to continue. He's struggling to put pressure on that right leg, and he's trying to walk it off. But it was such an impact, he really is struggling to continue here, Rob. Yeah, he's struggling, and he's been struggling down that right-hand side up against, he's made a start. I was just wondering, wow, he's jumping up and down, now see, you think he'll be all right? 22 minutes play. Ecuador yet to pose a threat, but this scoreline would be enough for them. Senegal realistically needs a win, and it's 0-0, and you're listening to five lines. Ball played back for Ecuador with Estapinan, and then it's hit long by Torres. Up it goes to Estrada. Estrada will give chase. It was Diallo who cleared the ball out for a throw from inside his penalty area, and over on that right-hand side, Presiado is now able to resume. He's back on the field of play, and seems to be walking all right. In Capge to Torres. Forward ball. Ecuador just starting to see a little bit more of the ball. In Capge, now it's with Casino, and then in Capge goes back towards his goalkeeper, Galindes. And Senegal at this stage are not wanting to press the ball in that final third. Casino has popped up almost as a left-back position. Estapinan has really gone quite high. He's over the halfway line, but Ecuador will play the ball across the back, and now it's with Torres once more. Little touch from Presiado. Ball goes down the line, and... Classer on the end of it. Senegal now have it on the left-hand side. Up towards Giard, headed away by Torres, tied it up in the midfield. Couldn't get hold of it in the midfield with Grueso, and Senegal now will invite Savali the right-back to come forward. Just touches it down the line, makes that run ahead of Giard, who turns and runs in field, wrestles to the floor, no foul. Try to get it out wide from Cease to the left basalt. Ecuador have got a number of yellow shirts back, and it was Estapinan. And now, in capier, and the clearance from Gallendez clears long for Ecuador. Still 0-0. Ball in the midfield is contested so hotly, because they both know that they can attack. Saar, wriggles away from the challenge left-hand side. Saar cuts into the penalty area, and shoots off his right foot. Taking the deflection on its way through, it's another corner kick to Senegal, it's still goalless. Well, got himself that half-eater space. Gallendez watching the shot in the Ecuador goal was beaten, not by the shot itself, but by the deflection. You just hope you're desperate for that not to dip. Certainly had a bit of dip on it, just the toe. It's comfortable, wasn't it? I knew it was going wide. Had a bit of dip, had a little bit of curl. Jacobs to take the corner kick, near side, left foot in. Gallendez gets something on it, comes out to the edge of the area, fired back in then by Papagay. It's Rezegay out to Jacobs. It's a left foot across into the penalty area, and it's a looping one off the head of Abdujialo, the central defender, and it's comfortably claimed by the goalkeeper, and it is still Ecuador 0, Senegal 0. It's not the biggest of Gallendez, but he likes to come to corners. They've had three, they've all been in swinging, they haven't put any player on him, and he's come for all three, and one all three. Senegal, I think there's something he might need to address there. What would you say he is? 5'10\"? Push in my old teammate, Jimmy Walker. He's about his height, about his stature. Is that just cracks in the goalkeeper's union? Are you doubting his capability? No, I think he's brave, he's coming for the ball, he's doing well, he's getting amongst the bodies. You're looking at Diallo, and Senza half, Cooley-Bali alongside him, he's coming in amongst the bodies, but he's just being allowed to do so. But have you detected a weakness or a potential weakness? No, I've been in on his 100% record so far. There it is, the goalkeeper's union stands as firm as ever. Here is Estupina on this left-hand side for Ecuador, and he'll get a throw, he was being tracked by that burly frame of Cooley-Bali. There's been a goal in the Elba, Netherlands catar, Masferuci. And it's for the Netherlands in Gakpo with his third goal in as many matches for the Netherlands, the first Dutchman to do so. The Netherlands have a one-goal lead, 27 minutes played, they move up to seven points at the top of Group A. And that takes him level with Enne Valencia here and Kylian Mbappe leading the way for the Golden Boots with three goals apiece now, with that goal for Gakpo, and as we suspected, Netherlands, what I would imagine would be a comfortable win, are already then leading by a goal to nil, which would mean that they likely to finish top of Group A, and therefore meet in the last 16, the runners-up who ever finishes second in Group B. Which of course we'll find out later, Wales will hope that they can produce a result tonight to maybe snatch that spot. England of course will have something to say about that when they meet commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 7, but a healthy build-up on BBC Radio 5 Live in the run-up to that game with Mark Chapman and Cole. But it's nil nil here, and the Ecuadorian support, you can just about here over the beat of the constant drums here in the Khalifa International Stadium. Senegal with Cease in the midfield, out towards that far side. Played forward by Jacobs, the left back continues his run, couldn't get there, and Pressiada will play it forward, and it runs out of play, a little bit scrappy from both sides, and it's a throw at nil nil. You can say that there's a huge bank of Ecuadorian fans on the far side, but these drums are so loud that you can see them singing, you can see them clapping, but you can't hear them. What was that? 28 minutes played. Here is Tula Valley on the half-way line. Running forward is Sabali. Sabali can't wriggle his way through, but he has managed to find Njai. Now it's with Idrisse Gait. Idrisse Gait plays the ball out wide. Jacobs coming forward, crossed from the left by Sar, and Njai had made that run coming in off the right-hand side, couldn't get a connection, and it just runs and squirts away off his right foot, and is gathered in by Gallindo. Yeah, it didn't work out. I'm not sure there's a right decision on the ball in. Not enough of a presence in the penalty area, but again, it's comfortable possession. Four Senegal in the Ecuador half, and looking at Edvard Mende, the Chelsea goalkeeper in goal for Senegal, barely had a touch yet. Yeah. And what was that statistic that you had picked out about... Edward Mende, one of your former clubs, Chelsea? One clean sheet, the first game of the season for both club and country so far this season. So 12 without a clean sheet for club and country. It's 0-0, approaching a half hour of football here at the Kaleepa International Stadium. The Netherlands are leading Qatar by a goal to nil. They scoreline those suits. Ecuador, they would go through with a Dutch to the last 16. Aliusse Sey in his grey tracksuit, black baseball cap. His long hair, straight down the back of that grey tracksuit top, whereas in contrast, the smartly dressed Gustavo Alfaro, who, the Ecuadorian coach, who's at his fifth World Cup, his previous four, however, was working as a TV pundit, and now he's down there in that expansive TV area, hoping to see Ecuador through to the knockout stages for the first time since the Germany World Cup in 2006. He paces up and down in his suit, although he won't be too warm because the air conditioning will be taking full effect down there, as this is Cule Valley at the back, coming under pressure, managing to hold off the challenge of Alan Franco, and then back to Mendy to clear it away long towards Saar, but Presciardo climbs high in the air, ball headed forward, and then played for Ecuador out towards that far side. Guresso has a touch. Now it's back with Felix Torres. Estupina is available on this left-hand side, and here is the Brighton and Hobalbi in player, carves the ball forward towards Casido, looking towards Enne Valencia, who'd stayed out wide on the left, but Ecuador lose the ball, and now it's in Gise forward ball, and it's dealt with by Incapié, and it will be out for a goal kick, and we're still at nil-nil. Yeah, just looking at this, and it's not working for Ecuador. They're so narrow and so tight in the centre of the field that they just haven't got a pass out. There's no outball for them at the minute, out wide. Just thinking that Qatar, when they did have their joy against Senegal in the previous game, is when they switched to a three at the back and played with wing-backs, that would naturally give you more width, a little bit higher up the pitch, and that might be something that Ecuador look at. They can play three at the back. They have done in this tournament so far, so at the minute this 4-3-3 is not working for them, because it's just so tight and so condensed when they get the ball. That's the voice of Rob Green, former England international goalkeeper, who of course played in the World Cup in South Africa in 2010. We've got 13 minutes to go to halftime. It's still Ecuador nil, Senegal nil. And, Gruesso just dropping out in between the two central defenders. Out to Presiado. Presiado turns on the halfway line. Yellow shirts, Navy short, playing from right to left. Torres. Gruesso once again. Is he staying there? Well, right on cue, he's dropped into centre half, into the middle centre half to create the third man. Ecuador now hit the ball long. Estipina had made the run. Kula Vali had spotted it, and actually directs the header across towards this near side, and then the ball is played away by Ceballi, the right back for Senegal, and it will go out of play for a throw, and it will be an Ecuadorian throw that they take quickly. And a Valencia. Down the line on this near side, the left. Estipina. Valencia's continued his run. Estrada tries to find him. Kula Vali comes across, and Valencia has gone down, holding his knee. He was a doubt with a blow to the... Oh, he's all right. He was quickly back on his feet. That was a miraculous recovery for Venom Valencia. He went from really, really badly injured to really confused, to really angry, to being fine. Yeah. Yeah. From writhing in agony, wagging his finger in frustration and annoyance, and then all of a sudden, oh, I'm okay. Nil-nil. Just over 10 minutes to go at a half-time. Ball hit long by Mendy. They certainly had a bright start for the first 15 minutes Senegal, created a number of opportunities, but we've had a little bit of a lull in terms of very few chances at either end since. Yeah, Ecuador, please. They've got a foothold in the game, and realistically, Grewezo in that defensive midfield role is now dropping in to centre half, and it's just allowing them to play. It sounds a bit of a strange situation that another defender allows you to be more aggressive, but that's what it's allowing them to do, because they can play on the front foot when they're lose-able. Here is Valencia, Estipenian on his left-hand side, and it will go out of play, 4-8 throw. It was well-marshalled out by Yusef Sabali, who plays for Real Betis. This French-born right back missed out on Senegal's African Cup of Nations success, but he was recalled in March, and he's in no real hurry to take the throw down below. We have got 10 minutes plus stoppage time, for which there will be a bit because of that injury to Presciardo in this first half on BBC Radio 5 Live. Gula Balli got away with that. It wasn't a great ball out from defence, and Gonzalo Plata wasn't alert enough, and it went behind him without him really realising by the time he had spotted it, it was already bypassed him from the back of him. Senegal coming forward, all in white, looking for the ball forward, and it just actually took a touch up one of the central defenders. It was in Capierre, which allowed it to take it away from Gulea Jard and into the path of the goalkeeper. Yeah, he wasn't getting there. He made the decision to come. I don't think he was getting there. There wasn't enough pace on the ball for him to skip through to him, and then all of a sudden the deflection took it away to safety for him. Estrada loses out in the challenge with Gula Balli, effective defending, using his strength well. Gula Balli and Senegal will build from the back with nine minutes remaining to half-time. So Balli is forward over the halfway line, manages to get away from Valencia, and then he was fouled by Estapinean. Senegal have a free kick just in from the right touch line, listening to BBC Radio 5 Live, also available through the BBC Sounds app. Six yards in from the right touch line, still 0-0. Senegal need to win. The Dutch leading cat up by a goal to nil. From seven o'clock tonight, we'll keep you across, around the United States and commentary of Wales, England. But this is a free kick. Ecuador have got the yellow shirts lined up on the wall. The left back has wandered across to this near side the right to take it. Ismail Jacobs, or will it be the right foot of Idris Agay? He's going to leave it. Jacobs swings it over with his left foot, and the header was over the top, and it was a looping header from Cease and didn't really pose much of a problem at all. They almost lessened headed. He was that far out, 12-13 yards out. Not enough pace on the ball, not enough timing on the header either. It has dampened Senegal's start. That was a pull ball out from the back by Ecuador. Senegal have got it back. Jacobs to Diallo, just inside his own half. He plays the ball forward towards Sar. He shifts it on the inside. Senegal still looking to try and attack with the interception from Casido. As he goes in for a 50-50 with that one, and Casido has stayed down there for referee Ecuador and Jai. The ball plays forward, Sabali pops up in the inside right channel of the penalty area, and Ecuador cleared away through Felix Torres. Out of play, it goes for a throw. Casido is now back on his feet. That looked like it could have been really dangerous. Sackle, quick throw. Sar and Idris Agay, combining on the right-hand side, Idris Agay is crossed, caught by the goalkeeper Galindes. And now Casido has gone down, and he's going to require treatment. Whilst I should just say that, there is a statistic. So many happy memories of Africa. And those listening on the World Service will know from Sheena, and met him in the African Cup of Nations in Ghana in 2008. He introduced me to Asha, that wonderful Nigerian singer. But I noticed on social media today that he put out a tweet that African sides have won only nine of 43 final group matches at the World Cup. And of those 29, where there's been a mathematical chance of progress, they've only won nine of those 29. So that's what, about a one in three opportunity. So you're saying there's a chance? There's a chance. But it's still 0-0. It's not enough at the moment. Casido actually got away with one now. There's a two-footed jump into the tackle with Ishmael Saar. He's come the worst off for it. He's going to start going down and sliding in. But if he'd have landed onto Ishmael Saar, he's completely out of control. And landed two-footed into the ground. If that were Saar's leg, then the referee, Clement Erpin, would have had to go over and have a look, I think, with the VAR. Let's get an update of Netherlands Qatar as the treatment continues. Mas Haruki. The Dutch still lead 1-0. Qatar though, probably enjoying their best spell in the game. They're trying to get the crosses into the box. Van Dijk not happy with his Dutch players not closing down on pressing as much as he thinks they should. But the Dutch still on top, well on top, and still top of Group A. Have you ever encountered any tunes from Asher? No, no, no. I would recommend her. She's very, very good. Fire on the Mountain, a particular favourite. Okay, there were just words put together for me then. When we were in Ghana, we had George who was driving us around, not this George. And I would sit in the front and I would be charged the music and track five of Asher's album, Asher. Fire on the Mountain was constantly played. Sheenar wasn't happy. Well, with your navigation, we'll get the whole album in on the way back. We're finished to go to the break. It's still 0-0. Ecuador and Senegal, the Dutch still lead by a goal to 0. Ecuador though are attacking. Clear away by Diallo at the heart of the Senegal defence. Flags up on this near side. Jawa's offside, free kick to Ecuador. We'll certainly have a lot more jeopardy in the second half, because Ecuador will probably think they'll take chances to strike on the counter. They'll sit and they'll be happy. They've not played as well as they'd like in this first half, I don't think, but 0-0, they're doing the job. All played out to Presiado. Certainly been lively, full of intensity in their first games. That's where they caught their eye and they looked impressive. And I know many believe that should they play England in the last 16, on the evidence of the first two matches, that they could be awkward opponents. But here they've got something to protect. And they've got some concern at the back now. That was a rather clumsy challenge and the referee's given a penalty. Senegal have been awarded a penalty. No hesitation from Clemente-Apar. It was in capier, catching sartre, it was just too quick for him. Very, very clumsy. And Senegal have got the moment that they crave for. It's in capier, he's late. Just a touch and then the bundled over. It was clumsy from the start, from Ecuador, from the ball forwards, just a straight ball forwards, they just get it all wrong, all over the pitch. From there, he's just trying to track back, trying to get round and cover. Makes it second and completely wipes out. Smell of sartre, takes a blow for the team. It's a clear penalty and you have to say, over the first 45 minutes or so, it's been deserved for Senegal. So Senegal have been awarded a penalty. Iliman and Gai, the Sheffield United striker, has been handed the ball. Estupino is complaining to the French referee. We talked before about the back story for the Sheffield United striker, Iliman and Gai. What a moment this could be. Oh, in fact, he was only holding onto the ball. He's handed it over to Sartre. Ishmael of Sartre. Ten goals he has scored for Senegal. Six for Watford this season. Focused. Full of concentration. Sartre against Gallendez. The referee, Clemente Pant, just wanders forward to have a word with the Ecuadorian keeper on his goal line, who's all in blue, away towards our right-hand side. Senegal need to win. It's currently 0-0. What a moment this is. Ishmael of Sartre. It's the stuttering run-up, right footed, and Cooley swaps it into the bottom right-hand corner. Ishmael of Sartre, full with a smart kick, smiles for Senegal. In a game they have to win, they're leading by a goal to Nile, and the pressure now switches to Ecuador. Ecuador-0, Senegal won. Massive moment, massive moment. For Ishmael of Sartre, and he was as cool as you like. A slow, stuttering run-up. Waited for Gallendez, watched Gallendez, and as a keeper, they are the worst. You stand, you wait, you wait for as long as you can, and it's not long enough. He's just left, falling to one side as he rolls it in the other. They've deserved this, they've been the better side in this half. They haven't taken the chances, they wouldn't have got a better chance than that. Finally, they've taken one. Ecuador can certainly have no complaints about the score line, and they're going to have to rediscover their adventure. For what we've witnessed in the previous two games, if there's a get-back into this game, because Senegal have been the better side, they have created the more dangerous moments, and they have been proactive, and they've been rewarded. It was a clumsy penalty to give away, there was no doubts about it. In Capge, bringing down Sartre, but that was one cool penalty. Just see when he scored it. All the subs, the whole bench charging over to celebrate. I know it is a common theme in this World Cup, but it did feel like a real pressure release for them. There was an opportunity that they have actually taken, because they've had some really good chances, particularly early on. They've had the better of the play, but just maybe that belief is to say, who's going to take it, who's going to score one? Well, they've got their noses in front now. And with the Dutch, beating Qatar, leading Qatar by a goal to nil. They will go through as Group A winners, and Senegal going through as runners-up from Group A. And so should England, top Group B, it would be a first ever meeting between England and Senegal. Ecuador have got just 60 seconds, which makes a mockery of that, because Presiada was down longer than that for his treatment, but only an additional 60 seconds has been added. Oh, six minutes has been added. Ilimanjai, good touch from Ilimanjai, into the penalty area, onto his left foot, we kept it, runs out for a goal kick. So it was six minutes was added, wasn't it? Yep, they've got a real spring in the set, Senegal now. Well, that makes more sense. But certainly we're going to have to see an improvement from Ecuador. They've been very disappointing. They've been flat. It feels like they've put so much energy into the previous two games. They've had fits and starts of breaking away and breaking through the lines, but... Barely laid a glove. Senegal lead by a goal to nil, they've got a corner kick right-hand side. We're in stoppage time here on five-liebe. Adresigay waits to take it, right-footed, it's an out-swinger, headed away back behind by Torres. It'll go down for a throw. The assistant referee, it went right by his feet, and he's looking then for Clementerpan's match instruction before it signals which way it's gone. Independent thinking. One of my pet hates that. It's going to be a throw. Oh, now he's happy to tell him where it was from. It wasn't from there either. There is Ceballi on the right-hand side, down towards the byline. Ceballi will he win a corner kick? No, the assistant referee says it's a goal kick. Ooh, there's a little bit of afters up off the ball there, which the assistant referee, Ernesto Piñán, is getting involved in Clementerpan. There's an Ecuadorian player down and tempers are starting to fray. Casidos involved. The officials to their credit were, uh, Eliminin Giles been told to go away. They're just trying to get the Senegalese players away from that. Well, Ana Valencia has gone down, clutching his knee. What looked like nothing from Ceballi. It's just coming together between him. I don't think he was Valencia involved then. He's gone down just on his own. It was Ceballi who was actually pushed by Valencia. Oh, he was a blatant dive by Ana Valencia. Wow. He's just clipped the back of his leg. He's gone down, rolled in, he's clutching. They need a spark from somewhere. They need something to happen. I'm not sure that's going to be the case. Funnily enough, he's up and charging up the pitch now, ready again. Senegal are doing what they have to do. Leading by a goal to nil, Ecuador have created Zilch. I don't remember men touching the ball with his hands in open play, which is a sad indictment of the efforts from this game for Ecuador so far, really. No shots on target, two in total. Halftime in the other Group A game, Netherlands won, Kassar nil. We'll get news of that from Maz when we're at halftime here, where it's Ecuador nil, Senegal won. And the Maz ranks of the Ecuadorian support on that far side. A little bit subdued at the moment. Eliminated, back to Savali, first time cross from the right-hand side. Over the head of Sarr, climbed high as he'd made a run to the central area of the penalty box, about eight yards out, it'll be an Ecuador throw on that far side there, right, as they play from right to left. And we're in stoppage time, we've got about 60 seconds remaining of the stoppage time. Senegal, though deservedly leading. Idrisse Gae, ball played out by Papage. Forward to Idrisse Gae, one bounce out of play goes for a goal kick. And at the minute, there is a player down at Sarr, the goal scorer, who's just been told by Clement Erpan he's got to get to his feet. He was just caught on the inside of his right leg by Franco. I think he'll be all right, that wasn't the worst contact. But they've had an intensity to their play, they've had a direction, they've had a purpose. They've looked good Senegal, they've deserved this. There is the halftime whistle and Senegal deservedly lead at the break by a goal to nil. And it was a very, very cool penalty by Ismail Assar after he was brought down from a clumsy challenge from in Capier. He's got the right foot in, he's slotted the ball into the bottom right hand corner. So Senegal knew that only a win realistically would do. And they are halfway there inside the Khalifa International Stadium against the disappointing Ecuador. It's Ecuador nil, Senegal won. Ian Dennis and Rob Green, thank you very much for now. We'll be back to the Khalifa Stadium for the second half of that match and the table stands Qatar bottom with zero points. Ecuador second bottom with four points. Senegal in second place with six points. And the Netherlands standing on seven points because they lead against Qatar, the halftime whistle has gone and Maz Farouk is there, it's a familiar goal scorer Maz. It is indeed a 1-0 lead over Qatar at halftime for the Dutch Kelly Kodi Gap Pro with a lovely finish, 26 minutes in that is third goal. In as many group games for the Dutch at this World Cup, he's the first man from his country in factor score in each of his first three World Cup appearances. For much of the first half, it's been like a training exercise for the Netherlands in terms of their attack versus Qatar's defence. Memphis de Pye has been making a real nuisance of himself as well in his first start at this tournament. For Louis van Haal though, I think he prefer another goal or two just to make the scoreline reflect the Netherlands dominance on the pitch. The Dutch do lead one and a halftime and they are top, as you say, on seven points. Qatar, rock bottom with zero. I remember already been eliminated from their own World Cup before this game. Maz, thank you very much for that. So these Group A games are taking place concurrently. Three o'clock kick-offs for Ecuador Senegal, Netherlands against Qatar at seven o'clock in Group B. It's Wales against England at the same time as Iran played USA. We'll look ahead to that match-up between Wales and England after the BBC News with Jill McKenzie. Take the World Cup with you, Qatar 2022. On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live. For the first time ever, less than 50% of the population in England and Wales have described themselves as Christian on the census. 37% of people now say they have no religion. When asked about ethnicity, 86% of people said they identified as white. That figures down five percentage points from a decade ago. The UK Health Security Agency says around 20 people could have died because of a mistake in a COVID lab that led to 39,000 positive tests being reported as negative. Experts estimate that the error led to an extra 55,000 infections. The Foreign Office's Summary of Chindon's Ambassador after a BBC journalist was arrested, beaten and briefly detained in Shanghai. The Foreign Office Minister David Rutley spoke in the Commons earlier. The arrest of BBC journalists while covering the recent protests in Shanghai is a deeply disturbing and wholly unacceptable situation. The journalist must be able to do their job without fear of arrest or intimidation. NATO has accused Russia of using winter as a weapon of war in Ukraine. The Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, has promised more weapons and insists members won't back down in their support of Kiev. In the past few minutes, the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelensky, has been addressing MPs at Westminster. She's in London for a meeting on preventing sexual violence in conflicts. The government says its new online safety bill has not been watered down, even though part of it has been dropped. Originally, tech companies would have been forced to remove material which was harmful but legal, covering things like self-harm or eating disorders. Dame Caroline Dinej is a Conservative MP who worked on the bill. She thinks this change could cause harm. Online platforms have algorithms which effectively send you into an echo chamber, which bombard you with information that just reinforces your paranoia or your position on something and suggests more and more extreme and explicit content. And the British Poultry Council says an estimated 600,000 free-range turkeys have had to be culled or died because of bird flu. That's around half the free-range turkeys produced for Christmas. The latest travel and the latest on the M6 in Staffordshire. The M6 is now a contrived at Junction 15, a vehicle court fire, and all traffic is being held back with a cue on the approach. The M60 anti-clockwise all open at Heaton Park at Junction 19 after the accident. At the M62, all traffic was held at Brickhouse at 25 on the eastbound side, but it's all open again now. The M60 again and 23 at Ashton, Glees Instant going on with two lanes closed clockwise. The M1 at 10 at Luton Airport, Spurt, Brokendam van in one lane, and the A5 just near the M1 at 11 A Dunstable, turned and it lost its load of gravel to the roads partly blocked, and a couple of places on the clockwise M25 along the bottom at Junction 6 Godston, all traffic being held to clear a breakdown, and a lane closed at Junction 10 for the Whisly in to change one imagine to five live travel. As things stand in group A, Netherlands are going through as group winners, and Senegal are going through as second place, which means they would face the winners of England and Wales Group. So Senegal 1-0 up against Ecuador a half time. We'll get Stephen Walnut's thoughts on that very shortly, but after those games finish, of course, attention will turn to Group B. Seven o'clock kickoffs, Iran take on the USA. At the same time, England face Wales, and that's live on Five Live and BBC Sounds. I've been speaking to Wales fan and Five Lives' very own Ellis James. He was out here for the USA game. I asked him if this tournament feels different to others that Wales have qualified for. I think, unlike 2016, where we were just so delighted to have qualified for something we didn't really mind. I think no one in Wales felt we didn't deserve to be there. You know, this is the third major tournament we've qualified for in the last four. I was desperately hoping we'd get out the group. That was always the ambition. I don't personally, I don't think it's going to happen, even though obviously who knows what will happen tonight. But more sort of excitingly, it was amazing. I only went to the first game after Doha, so I watched the Iran game Cardiff. But it was amazing just walking around and being recognised by Ecuadorians and Mexicans and Argentinians and Brazilian's for having a Wales shirt on. It was like a sort of FIFA corporate video that you don't quite believe. Everybody clasped hands standing on a hill singing together. Sort of also like that. You think, is there a film crew? Is this part of the script? No, it was amazing. No matter what happens tonight, we'll always have that penalty, which was just seeing a score. It's like when Bayer scored against Slovakia in the first game of Euro 2016. Once you've seen a goal at a major tournament, having failed to qualify for so long, they're just really, really special. So tonight obviously all to play for. But yeah, no matter what happens, you can't be too angry or despondent because we've waited so long for this and you can't question any of the players' commitments. So yeah, I'm just trying to be very, very sanguine. Yeah, and you're thinking about what's going to happen afterwards. But what was it like when you were in Qatar? I think people have come over with mixed feelings about coming over and there's slightly complicated experiences when they're here, certainly on an emotional level. I think the thing that sums it up is that I went to a party in a hotel, and I tried to kick off. And I saw an old friend of my school teacher, the person who took me to my first Wales game, and he took hundreds. I tried to work this out, probably thousands of... Did you hang on? Did you arrange to see that person or did you just bump into him? No, no, I just bumped into him. No way. So I hadn't seen him for years. And his sort of friend, best friend from school, was the person who'd taken me to my first game. So we talked about how much he would have loved to have been there. And then we talked about the people we'd sort of... We talked about Gary Speed, you know, I talked about him with fans and all the people who would have loved to have seen it. And then I'd have a drink with members of the Rainbow Wall, the LGBTQ Plus, sort of Welsh fans association. And they had rainbow bucket hats that they were going to put on any empty seats to represent friends of theirs who didn't feel they could be at the game. So that was obviously a very emotionally challenged conversation. And I found out later that they had had hats confiscated as they walked into the ground. So it is... I think a lot of supporters have felt compromised by the choice of venue. But then again, it's the fans of the set of people who don't get a say into where a World Cup is held. So I wouldn't say it's the same experience as 2016. 2020 obviously was so different because of the pandemic. But with 2016, because France is so close, there were about 50,000 Wales fans, you know, made the trip over. And I think it's about three or four thousand for this World Cup. Because also it's expensive and it's just before Christmas. But I've got to be honest, when walking around Doha for the forties hours I was there, having a drink with fans from other countries, you know, we've only ever played two non-European teams in competitive matches. And I was in 1958, so it's a completely new experience for the vast majority of us. If there is one thing though that has disappointed you in some way about this, this Wales side, is it that in the games that we've seen at the World Cup, it doesn't look like the Wales side that we've seen in qualifying? No. And I didn't expect that to happen. If you'd not seen us qualify, you would think that we were rubbish because we really, we've played three very poor halves of football. We came alive a little bit again, second half against the USA. I don't know what's going to happen tonight. Against Iran, I was really hoping for a repeat of Euro 2020 where we'd have this nervy draw against the Swiss. And then it was a real bail in Ramsey masterclass against Turkey. But Ramsey in particular was fantastic that night. And then we beat them didn't have to qualify for the last 16. And I was hoping for that. It didn't quite happen. I don't know why there is. I think to be honest, too many of our important players aren't playing regular enough club football. I personally hate playing England. Some people love an international derby. I never enjoy it. They're always weird tense games. We haven't beaten them since 1984. And you know, we need to go for it. We need to take that brick off. And I'm not sure if you've got it in us, but we shall see if we do win. It would be very well actually to win and then for us to still not go through. We shall see. I'm very, very tense slash trying to enjoy it, slash trying to remember it forever and make memories. I think Alice speaks for a lot of Wales fans there when he says that he's just trying to make memories from this competition. But joining me now, Radio Wales Sport Football Commentator Simon Davis. Simon, in terms of who starts for Wales, there's been a bit of a debate about maybe Gareth Bale, maybe Aaron Ramsey shouldn't start. They add so much to that Wales side. They each have a moment in them. How big a risk do you think it'd be if they didn't? Well, I think if Robert Page does that, and he didn't rule that out yesterday, by the way, in his media conference, if he did decide to drop by the Bale or Ramsey, he does make an immediate rod for his back. The result doesn't go their way. And it is a tall order anyway, even when you consider Bale and Ramsey being in the team, even without those players in the team. And if it doesn't get the result, then it would be a difficult question and a difficult post match press conference for Robert Page to face. There's a tall order for Wales in any case. But, you know, four-goal win is unlikely, you would suspect, against England. And even if they do manage to get a win, they would have to rely on the other result going their way. So important selection issues for Robert Page. And actually, there's some suggestion in reports this morning. I was reading the Daily Telegraph, Matt Law reporting, that players allegedly putting pressure on Rob Page to go with a back four, which would be their preference. Now, that would be interesting. Who misses out? Possibly Connor Roberts. But as for the Bale and Ramsey debate, I suspect, I think they'll both play just because of who they are and the stature that they have within this Wales camp. So just to reiterate what Wales need then, it's a victory over England and for Iran and USA to draw. In terms of what Wales can actually control, it is England in the last game of the group stages. Does it help that this is one that they'd be motivated for whatever was at stake? Well, you could say the same for England as well. I've noticed some of the papers dragging up that infamous video from of the Wales players celebrating that win over England in Euro 2016, or rather Iceland's win over England in Euro 2016. So maybe that lights a fire under the England squad. But Wales-England games, they're always very tasty affairs, aren't they? Britain and maybe that provides its own motivation. But the crux of it, Kelly, and Alice James touched on this, your previous guess, the crux of it is they have not played very well the last two games. OK, second half performance against USA was slightly more encouraging, but they're going to have to play a heck of a lot better against England to stand any chance of reaching the last 16. Simon, thank you very much. Simon Davis there, Radio Wales Sport, football commentator. So as things stand, the winner of England's group will face Senegal. They are 1-0 up against Ecuador. Second place in England and Wales group will face Netherlands at the moment. They are 1-0 up against Qatar. I'll comment too much. Is Ecuador against Senegal from the Califah Stadium? Stephen Warnock is watching that one for us. It's come down to a penalty at the end, but Ecuador, who in theory should have been a bit stronger in this, have been disappointing. Yeah, they have. I just wonder about the mindset going into the game, whether they thought a draw would be enough. And they just haven't bought that energy. Gustavo Alfaro will probably make a couple of changes at halftime and try and bring a bit more to the game in the second half. Stephen will speak to you at full time in this one as you watch your sweepstake boys, Ecuador, in action against Senegal, who are winning. Your commentary team for this one, Rob Green and Ian Dennis. Underwear in the second half. Ecuador have made a couple of changes as well. German Samiento of Brighton and Hobalbian has come on to replace Alan Franco in the midfield. Jose Cifuentes has also come on and he has replaced Carlos Grueso in the midfield too. So they'll line up with Galindes in goal. Frasiado in capier, Torres in estupiña. The midfield of Samiento, Casado and Cifuentes with Plata, Valencia and Estrado. Yellow shirts, Navy shorts and in this second half playing from left to right as we look and they need a goal. Because they are trailing by a goal to nil and they had to avoid defeat. Senegal all in white, Edward Mendy back four of Ceballi, Culebali, Diallo and Jacobs and then it's Cease. Idrissegue and Papage with Saran the right, Jathru the middle and Illumin and Jai down the right hand side. There's an injury and there's been another goal in the other game in group A, Masparuki. Frankie De Jong has put the Netherlands two nil up against Guitare. It was a tap in for him after a Memphis to Pyshot was blocked by Barsham into his path. The Netherlands look like they're going to progress from this group as group winners. Netherlands two, Katar Niel. So the Netherlands will play the runners-up in group B. Of course we will find out after the game has finished kick-off seven o'clock. As soon as this match is over we'll be over to Mark Chapman and Co. The Wales England, the United States against Iran. Ecuador have got to put in an improved performance. They had it in their hands, it was in their grasp, their destiny was in their own hands. But they really have to twiled so far, Rob Green. Yeah, they've been flat. And you wonder, the chat at half time you turn around and say, if we're going to go out, let's not go out like this. Because this is pretty tetted. This isn't our identity as a team. This isn't what they brought to the tournament so far. They've changed formation, they've gone to 4-4-2. And the Valencia going straight up top with Estrada, Plato on the right, Sarmento on the left and almost a 4-2-2-2. As we've seen quite often in the Premier League this season and the wide men coming narrow. So maybe it'll bring a change, maybe it'll bring a spark. Certainly do need to change a difference in intensity. All at the back with Piero in capierre, he gave away the penalty. Now with Felix Torres, across to this near side, Preciado the right back, plays the ball forward, it's laid off. They were looking for a little bit of an interchange there that are unable to find their way through. So they have to work it back. And capierre comes forward from defence now, his central defensive roll. Ball is rolled out square and the shot from distance from Cifrentes, comfortably saved by Edward Mendy along the ground right footed from a good 30 yards out from goal. And he had a good view of that all the way through and he was just down on one knee, no problems. Yeah, comfortable, but a bit more of an idea of how to play, a bit more of an idea of keeping the ball in the opponent's half from it. He almost gets the impression that it could be a role reversal in this half where Senegal don't have to chase it now all of a sudden, might be lulled into sitting back and losing the way a bit, Billent, Ecuador with a Valencia and Estrada up front having to force it. Because all of a sudden it's Senegal who has something to protect. They had to be the proactive side and they certainly were in the first half but they have to win. Just the one goal changes everything. And Ecuador only have to avoid defeat, the Dutch are leading by two goals to nil. Ecuador have been awarded a free kick far side the left, 10 yards inside the Senegal half. The Senegal drums continue to beat away towards our right hand side. Quite a high line from Senegal all in white to try and protect Edward Mendy as best they can. Estapina searching free kick from that left hand side just about make out the voices of the large Ecuadorian support. But nothing really comes from that, it was hit, it was long, it was hopeful Senegal will have a free kick. It's a real waste, the free kick from D. Ecuador have got, I would say not the biggest team in the world in the year, look up. In the centre of the goal you've got Cease, you've got Diallo, you've got Culebally who are towering over them and they just toss it in there, they just throw it in there and hope for the best, you think you can't do something different because you're just not going to win the ball. Long throw from Jacobs, runs away off Jaren out, it goes for a goal kick. And certainly this Ecuadorian side who when they took on the Dutch at 25 years and 256 days it was their average age on their side, was their youngest ever at a World Cup. They haven't been able to replicate anywhere near the same levels of energy as they have in their previous two matches. Cebele took free kick, he was fouled, he was tucked inside and as he just stepped forward he was caught and it will be a free kick to Senegal. He was lucky as well, he just got caught as you say Dano, he lost control of the ball, he was thrown on the top of the foot, Estapinian had won it and played and was away. Cebele, a little bit fortunate. The only thing about Senegal and you mentioned about Mendes' dreadful record for club and country, Chelsea and Senegal without keeping a clean sheet since the opening day against Everson, Senegal as a country, won clean sheet in their last ten appearances at a World Cup. That was of course a stunning win against France in 2002. Cece was captain of Senegal that day, watching down below in that expansive technical area in his grey tracksuit top with the black base, Paul Cat, the former Birmingham Portsmouth midfielder. Now of course the manager, seven and a half years he's been in charge of the coaches out here at the World Cup, only Didier de Chomp of France and Fernando Santos of Portugal have had longer spells in charge of their respective teams and he's certainly built a solid foundation, they've only conceded 62 goals in 97 games. Ecuador though are coming forward, Tresiado right hand side with a cross on the stretch, was Cece to clear the ball away, he goes out for a throw to Ecuador, they want to take it quickly. Tifuentes plays the ball back to the halfway line, Torres goes square and Cappier out towards the far side, ball hit forward along the ground, Ecuador with Enne Valencia hasn't had anywhere near a sniff of goal of looking for that record breaking seventh successive goal but they are attacking, coming back to help out. And the manager is again on the edge of his own penalty area, Cule Valley marshalling that defence, they push on out. Ecuador though have the ball back in the centre circle, eight minutes into the second half, Ecuador starting to see a lot more of the ball as you'd expect for a side that needs an equaliser on BBC Radio 5 Live. Out it goes towards the far side, the left, Estapinian who will give the decision and once again it will go in favour of Ecuador. But it's better from Ecuador, they've got more attacking options up front, they've got more players in advanced positions, but also in better positions, so you have Cece who's the defensive, Mildfield at full Senegal and they're just taking up positions either side of him. Clato now it's done. His forward ball was a curling one to the edge of the area, he was looking to Enne Valencia who just couldn't quite control it and the bounce deceived his left foot around the high and it went out for a goal kick. But because the more bodies are forward, just in that instance there, it allows to tuck in and say, right, OK, I can pitch up a position that I wasn't taking in the first half and that gives me, it gives my team mates an option and I ask a different question of Senegal. They've not sussed it out yet, they haven't really adjusted. Ecuador come into this game on a good run of form, they've only lost one of their last 17, that was against Paraguay back in March, but they are trailing by a goal to nil. BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds for this final match in Grupe, where the Dutch going through as Grupe winners leading Qatar 2-0, Idrisse Gay for Senegal, who'll be joining them in the last 16 to join France, Brazil and Portugal who'd already secured their last 16 berths. Ball hit long, up towards Platter, it'll kick on through towards Edouard Mendy. As soon as this game is finished, Wales, England, Iran, the United States, Mark Chapman, John Murray, Matt Upsson, Michael Richards, BBC One, you can watch and listen through the BBC iPlayer for World Cup Extra. For what should be a cracking listen. Senegal with Cease, out to Jacobs the left back, goes back towards his central defender, Abdu Diallo, hits it right footed. Estapiniano wins the ball for Ecuador, he's just inside his own half, inside to Quesido, drives forward, Ecuador holding the ball up in the midfield, back to Torres, out to the right hand side, Cifuentes, Preciado came under pressure, quite a high line from Senegal Robb. Yeah, high line without a lot of pressure, they're going to have to get it right, they're allowing, just about into their half, that's the trigger, the ball gets over to half A-line, that's when we press, let's hold a shape, that's what we said in the second half, when they've got something to sit on, are they going to sit? Well, they're waiting, they're waiting and barred in the time. Ball goes out to Preciado, but Jacobs will head it away, the left back for Senegal, all in right playing from right to left as we look. Here is Cifuentes, Torres the central defender, and Capier will look for an opportunity to try and redeem himself after giving away the penalty that was conferred by Sa just before half time, that is the difference between the two, 12 minutes into the second half, certainly the smartly dressed coach, Gustavo Alfaro is urging the yellow shirts to get forward, Estepenian has come into a central area, creates Samiento to get a little bit of width on that left hand side, and here is the Brighton player, two Brighton players creating the width for Ecuador on that left hand side, Estepenian with the cross, and the header running wide from Michael Estrada, he was always running away from goal, and he had to stoop a fraction as well, it lacked the direction and it lacked the power. Yeah, it wasn't a great ball in and also, because it was a slow build up, Senegal was set in the middle, two centre halves and the far full back, that's what you want in front of your goal, they had it set up perfectly. If you're going to score ahead here, it's going to have to be an absolute worldie from there, it wasn't. Ecuador, who in their opening two games had faced your seven shots, they faced 55 in the group stages at the World Cup in Brazil, that Senegal deserved at a leading day with a team on the front foot in the first half, and they got that breakthrough goal courtesy of a penalty, and Ecuador, who only had to avoid defeat, are looking for the equaliser. Estrada just outside the centre circle, referee spotted an infringement and gives a free kick to Ecuador in the centre circle, and we've been playing for nearly an hour now here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Rick and Rachel back from 5 Live Breakfast at 6 in the morning, Rick Edwards live in Doha, there'll be reflections and analysis, to of course Wales against England, who's going home, who made it through, all the questions will be supplied later on tonight, and then a chance to dissect that in the morning, and don't forget of course the World Cup Daily podcast, always available through BBC Sounds for the remainder of the tournament. This is day 10 of the World Cup, first day of the final round of group games, and at the minute it's the Dutch and Senegal who are going through from Group A, and a free kick to Senegal deep inside their penalty area, they've protected Mendy well. Yeah, they've got a good shape now, they've just adjusted after saying that they haven't been able to get it right, they've just dropped another man into midfield, they're just sitting a little bit deeper, a little bit narrower, and actually the intensity is there when they come into their areas, you see, they know what they want to do, conserve their energy, just sit and wait, and then when the chance is, let's pounce, let's go as a group, they're doing that well at the moment. Mendy clears the ball away, the Chelsea keeper, and it's the former Chelsea keeper who's just sat along to my right hand side, Rob Green, former England international, as Senegal are attacking, and Senegal get a free kick for a challenge from Fressiardo, and that was on Saab on this left hand side, just inside the 30 yard mark, and it's going to be a free kick which will mean that Jacobs has got that potential to lift one in with his left foot from this near side to the left. Yeah, and they've got a really high line here on the penalty area, edge of the penalty area, so as a left footer, you've got a great big area between the goalkeeper who's going to be four or five yards out, so it's 13-14 yards to hit, just ask your team mates, go and attack that space. Idris Aga is also there if he wants the in-swinger off his right foot on this near side to the left, Ecuador have got everybody back, it is the in-swinger from Idris Aga, and it was headed out well on the edge of the area by Caecido, as the PNL keep the ball in play, plays it on the inside, potential break is on, Ecuador couldn't take it in their stride with Sarmiento, swept long downfield, caught by Galindes, the Ecuador goalkeeper and Ecuador now through their central defenders, Torres, but because the press from Saar, who's a lone raider charging at the goalkeeper, they have to switch it out towards that far side, but Senegal's press has actually seen a turnover in play, and Senegal now go up towards Saar, but he's offside, he was fractionally offside in the central position. Yeah, unfortunately, just timed it off fraction early, that little run and had to check, and was offside because it was a good position, and a few players forward. Ecuador have a number of substitutes warming up down below, and there is activity, and it is going to be Joaquin Riasco, who's going to be coming on to support Ecuador. He's a forward, he's 23 years of age, he was named after Jorji Joaquin, Joaquin Riasco, Joaquin Riasco, Joaquin Riasco, Joaquin Riasco, Joaquin Riasco, Joaquin Riasco, Joaquin Riasco, Joaquin Riasco, Joaquin Riasco, He's a fullback, 57 caps, part of Ecuador's team that reached the World Cup in 2006, Senegal have been awarded a free kick, so whilst he gets his final instructions, Senegal who lead by a goal to nil, and they're happy with a score line, leading by that slender margin. Jacobs goes long, cleared away by Estapina, now it's with Papa Gay, back to Saab Ali, forward ball, Ilham Anjai keeps the ball in play, the Shekel United player, and they go all the way back to Edouard Mendy. We will go to Mas Farouk, he's watching the Netherlands, Kassar. 66 minutes gone, still the Netherlands 2, Kassar nil, but it's been a bit disjointed in the second half, and Van Halen's made a couple of substitutions, Janssen and Berhausser on, Klassen and De Pij off, and Kassar brought on 3 subs as well, Matari the score of their low World Cup goal, Boudiaf and Asad, the Netherlands lead, two goals tonight. Thanks Mas, Estrada is coming off, Michael Estrada, the top scorer in qualifying, but unable to really trouble the Senegal goal tonight, and so Joachim Friasco comes on to replace him with 63 minutes play. Just watching Anna Valencia, he wasn't the player to come off, but he's barely had a kick in this second half, you're wondering how much he's got left in his legs, but then you weigh up against, if they are going to score, it's going to have to be him you feel, because there's no one else to do it. Do you keep him on, even though his mobility is more and more limited, just with that potential threat, just because when he gets a chance he scores? That select band of strikers who've scored six goals in successive games, Eusebio, Paolo Rossi, Oleg Selenko, he was looking to try and become the first to score in successive goals at a country, at a World Cup, but hasn't really worked out that way, but they're going to maybe have to leave him on there. Questions bearing in mind, he was stretching off against the Netherlands, is he fully fit, but he's got to be there, go to a man at the moment, because they're struggling to create the opportunities, Ecuador. The ball is lifted into the path of the penalty area, but it's touched out of play by... in capier, and out it goes for a throw that Jacobs is wanting to take for Senegal, who are attacking, leading by a goal to nil, cleared by Tourette, up towards the halfway line, free kick against the new man, Riasco for a foul on Coulomb Valley. Another goal, Netherlands catarm, that's Faroukis. And the subs have made an immediate impact for the Netherlands, three-nil they now leave Berhaus with the goal, he was set up by Janssen in the catar box. The Netherlands well on top, still leading Group A, they're going to go through as the winners from this group into the last 16. Netherlands lead by three goals to nil. Yep, seven points from nine, four for the Netherlands, and Senegal with this win would leapfrog Ecuador into that runners-up spot for Group A, unless Ecuador can try and get an equaliser in the next 25 minutes or so. Ecuador, yellow shirts playing from left to right, out to Presciardo with his bushy hair on this near side to right. He goes in field, there was a challenge on Platter, and I think he was caught in the face by Adrissa Gay, and Adrissa Gay has been shown a yellow card that would rule him out of the last 16 encounter, should Senegal make it through to the knockout stages. Gay would now be suspended, and for the Everton midfielder, vastly experienced, 99 caps for him tonight, the joint leading appearance-maker for Senegal, that's a real blow. Here's a big blow, you feel a touch, unfortunately, you're led with the shoulder, just one that he misjudged in terms of where his shoulder should have gone. There's no real malice in the challenge, but a little bit of pressure for Ecuador. Three-kick to Ecuador, right-hand side, ten yards in, from the right-touch line, it goes behind for a corner, we'll quickly knit back to Masferuki. The goal for the Netherlands has been ruled out, there was a right arm, the ball rather, bounced off Gapro's right arm in the build-up, so it's still Netherlands 2-caternare. Well changed, anything? Oh, with the Netherlands still going through as group, a winners, thanks Mas, corner-kick for Ecuador on this right-hand side. And it's such good in the far post, statuettes defending from Senegal, Casino and Brydon Hovalbian with a valuable equaliser, and Ecuador, all they had to do was avoid defeats, totaled Mark to the far post, and he couldn't miss. Casino with a valuable touch, and Ecuador have levelled to Stone Senegal, 1-1. It's out of nothing, and it's as clinical as you want it to be. Brilliant ball in across the near post from the corner, whipped him with real pace, bodies just running across that near post, getting the glance on. As you say, Casino, drifted to that far post, completely unmarked, Senegal with their zonal marking, just allowing him to be there, the player on the line, playing him onside. It's a simple finish for him, it's a simple goal, he's brilliantly executed, Torres with the header down, Casino with the finish, as it stands, there going through. What about the defending from Senegal? Well, this is zonal marking for it, that you stand there and say, well, you've just got to win the first ball, because if you don't, there's that great big hole there at the far post. They've looked so comfortable in the second half, Senegal, something so simple that's cost them. Moises Casino with his third goal for Ecuador, all of a sudden has put them in the box seat behind the Netherlands, as far as group A is concerned. And it's interesting, and you said this Rob, right at the start of the second half, would Senegal's slender lead affect their approach to the game? And they haven't been as positive in this second half as they were in the first 45 minutes. No, but they've been comfortable, and they've looked fine, but there's always that danger of being in one go, it just takes a momentary slip, and Casino there, allowed the freedom of the six-yard box to finish. Ecuador have levelled, and should England top group B, free kick drops in, Culebally, what a response for Senegal! The free kick from the right-hand side, this time it was Ecuador's defence that didn't deal with it, and it popped up to Culebally, who Culebally right footed, slotted the ball in. They were levelled only for a matter of minutes, and Senegal are back in the driving seat, and it's Senegal, who are having a place in the last 16, and Culebally has scored his first goal for Senegal, and what an important goal it could be. What a goal, what a response, an instant response from Senegal, and another set-piece, and another avoidable goal. Culebally's made the run across the near post, it's missed him, and it's just responded, to come off Valencia trying to clear the ball, charging back towards his own goal, just hits him off his hip, off his thigh, and Culebally on the volley, six yards out, strikers finished from the centre half, it's come to life. Didn't he take it well? Time wasn't on his side there, because he had so much of a bit, waited and waited for the ball, felt like it took an age to get to him, but composed and clinical. And what a response from Senegal, they've changed the official timing, it was three minutes, but the first moment that they had to try and get back in front, and Senegal are doing that, and that has silenced the Ecuadorian support, they're all banked up in their yellow shirts over on that far side of the left, and even when temporarily Senegal were heading out, I'm not convinced that the drums stopped beating from the Senegalese to port away towards our right. They're going to be making a change, Alio Cisec for Senegal down below, there's been a clash of heads meanwhile on the far side, and the physios from both teams are racing onto the pitch, but it looks like it's going to be a double change. Nampal is Mendy, Leicester City is going to be coming on, and is that Bamba D'Ang as well, the player who almost joined Leeds United in the summer, then failed his medical, and now plays for Marseille. So Mendy will provide fresh legs in the midfield? Yep, he's the city midfielder, and you're looking now to say, you need cool heads in that, as all of a sudden, this game's been thrown into turmoil, we're out where we were at the start of the second half, but it just feels like every attack now, every set piece really, they've gone from looking so comfortable both sides on set pieces to sixes and sevens. As it stands, this is how Group A looks, Netherlands seven points, Senegal six, Ecuador four, Qatar the hosts zero, currently in Group B, with one game left to play, England four, Iran three, the United States two, Wales one. Live commentary coming up of Wales England here on BBC Radio 5 Live. They haven't stopped dancing and singing the Senegal supporters throughout the whole evening. That double change is being made, so it's going to be, have they ceased coming off? That is going to be being replaced by Nampales Mendy, and coming off then is going to be Illiman and Chai, the Sheffield United player, to be replaced by Bamba DA. So one member of the Giambas Academy from Sallie in Senegal comes off, another one comes on in Bamba DA, 16 minutes remain. Yeah, two like-for-like swaps, as you say, Dano, fresh legs in midfield, Django coming on this right-hand side and Mendy sitting in front in the middle. He is also a tall man, which in the state of the game and the way it's gone, can only help in defending set pieces, because both teams need help with it right now. So those two changes have been made, 16 minutes are remaining, and Senegal on BBC Radio 5 Live are leading by two goals to one. We're across Africa on the World Service, looking Senegal for the first time in 20 years to reach the knockout stages of a World Cup. Ecuador just have to try and find a little bit more energy in the next 15 minutes, just one more goal, they only have to avoid defeat. They want to take a quick throw, but there's going to be two balls on the pitch. Preciado is quick to cut that one out. Senegal have every white shirt back. Now it's with Torres. Certainly, Alio Cise, the coach, these are going to feel like a very, very long 15 minutes for Senegal. The attendance is 44,569 inside the Calipa International Stadium. With the Dutch leading by two goals to nil, we can safely say that we know a quartet of the last 16. France, Brazil, Portugal and Netherlands. But who will claim that fifth place out of these two? The next 14.5 minutes, Sami Enter of Brighton gets away from the challenge of Culeballi. Sends over the cross, headed up in the air by Diallo, headed forward by Preciado. And then the substitute down into the ground. In fact, no it wasn't, it was Plata, it was Gonzalo Plata, it was good control, but his left footed effort was saved by Edward Mendy. He needed it first time, clever header down, he was in enough space that just felt like he needed to take a touch because it wasn't going to sit right. He never actually did sit right for him, bubbling around, in and around. The penalty area, in and around his body didn't come down. Ball played forward for Ecuador. That was a good challenge stepping forward from Jacobsi at the left back. Senegal have the ball, and it's with Mendy. Culeballi hits it long forward right footed. Sars first touches to take it on the inside of Preciado, and he goes down under a challenge. The assistant referee has raised his flag, it's a corner. He just couldn't keep his feet, could he Sars? No, I'm not sure how he got a corner there because Preciado never actually got a touch on the ball. Certainly tangling. The last touch off Sars. Senegal, not quite worked out what they've done with their shape here. They've gone to a very, very narrow 4-3-3, which will only invite the full backs of Ecuador to go forward when they do get the ball. So, it's going to be an interesting last 10-15 minutes. Might be 15-20 with the fourth official. They're looking for back-to-back wins at a World Cup for the first time. They lead by two goals to one. Senegal on this near side the left. Jacobs with the corner, headed out of the near post. It goes for a throw to Senegal. In Dakar, Salih, places beyond. They'll be looking at the watches and just thinking and hoping. It's a time just to quickly run away, but it never works out that way when you're a supporter of a side that is hanging on with such a tight margin. And we have 12 minutes remaining, but at least Senegal have it at the Ecuador end of the field. And Ismail Jacobs will take the corner kick once again. It'll be an out-swinger. Left-footed, curling away from goal. Culler-Bali rising in the air. Won't go out of play. He's there to clip it back into the danger area. Headed out by Encapierre for Ecuador. And then it'll be tied it up at the back by Mendy. Nampales Mendy, that is, to Edouard Mendy, all in red, who clears it long downfield. Torres with a strong looping header forward. Senegal with Pave Gay in the midfield. But Idris Agay will have to shake off the disappointment of that suspension that will rule him out if any encounter in the last 16 for picking up a yellow card here tonight. Ecuador with the substitute. Jocke, Riasco. That was neatly done by Ceballi the right back. Ball played forward. Idris Agay plays it out towards Sar on this near side. Certainly not afraid to still be committing white shirts forward. That was Jacobs offering the support on this near side, the left. Ecuador get the ball away. Senegal will press midway through the Ecuador half. Riasco plays it into a central area. Casino's forward ball to Samiento on the left was intercepted. Mendy, forward ball. Nice little touch on the inside. They were looking to try and get Bambadiang forward. Over on that fast side, Senegal attack on the right. Ecuador with Estapinian, penned inside his own half and then cleared away by Encapier. Senegal lead 2-1 and we have just over 10 minutes remaining, Rob Green. Yeah, it's all a little bit frenetic from Ecuador and lost control of what they're trying to do. They're just trying to toss it forward as fast as they can and it's just not working. They just need to take the time because they've still got 10 minutes plus inevitable 10 minutes of so injury time, which we seem to get at the end of these games. It just needs cool heads in there because you're not going to do it just by lobbing, launching balls forward. That's for the last two, three minutes. You've got time. That'll certainly shred a few nerves in Senegal. One would imagine Estapinian with the cross just over the head of Riasco. It won't necessarily fall to Presiado on this near side, the right and cleared away. Mentioned that the World Cup Daily podcast will have all of the reflections and the analysis and the debate from the fallout of this first set of matches and the final group games in this World Cup in Qatar. There is also a special edition of the World Cup Daily out later this evening. Maurizio Pochettino has come to the studio in Doha. He's sat down with Lady Kelly to talk lots of things. I imagine that Messi comes up in conversation and so that you'll be able to get through BBC sounds. But nine minutes remain here and it's still Ecuador one, Senegal two. A bizarre decision there from Torres. He's under pressure on the halfway line. They've kept the ball quite well. Rather than going back to his goalkeeper, Galindez, he toe-punts it diagonally, straight out of play. No bounces. You're just that sort of decision-making. When you've only got minutes to go, if you can keep control of the ball, keep the pressure on. There's tired bodies, tired minds out there. Jacobs, good strong run from the left-hand side. Sar plays the ball back towards Mendi. Mendi now out towards the valley. Little touch from the right back forward. Shot, fired in! It was a sharp turn from Poolejart. Quickly spun away from his marker and rifled the right footed shot that was off target. That was a really good turn. It wasn't matched by the finish. Again, thinking on that angle and being closed down, maybe a better option. Here is Enne Valencia for Ecuador. Under eight minutes of normal time remaining. And that was well defended by Abdu Diallo, the Leipzig defender, to use his strength to let the ball just run out for a goal kick. You know I said to you earlier that when they went 1-0 up Senegal, they probably felt that they'd sat back a fraction. Do you think now that they've quickly gone back 2-1 in front, that they've adopted the approach they had in the first half and a bit more on the front foot, taking the game to Ecuador? I think they've just got more energy. They've got more to give. And I don't think that you look at their Enne Valencia, I don't think he's got anything left to give. As we were saying before, he's maybe a little bit tired, his touches were going out. The ball rolled out, played there. Diallo just saw it out so comfortably. There's very little fight left in him now. And it just looks like Senegal have got so much more to give. Jalindes with the clearance, all in blue away towards our left-hand side. Enne Valencia heads it on, then he's just checked there. All the referee has said get up. I thought it was the challenge from Abdul Diallo. I just thought he came across and checked him with no attempt to play the ball. Well, after saying he's got no energy whatsoever, he was away then. Sandwich between Diallo, Cooley-Bally, they weren't letting him through, that's for sure. That was like two bounces at a nightclub door saying, not tonight, son. You're going home. Talking from experience. You're going, yeah. No way through because they just closed off the avenue. And here is Diallo, who chips the ball along with a curling pass out towards the right-hand side. Six minutes remain. Senegal are doing what they had to do. They're leading by two goals to one. They had to win. Ecuador only needed a point as Mendi dances his way through the Ecuadorian midfield out towards Ceballi on the right-hand side. Saliento though is back there and now all of a sudden Ecuador are back in possession. And that was a free kick given away and Ecuador will have a free kick midway through their own half and there's going to be another change for Ecuador. And it's going to be Peronzo who's going to be coming on. This is a player who, when he was at Boa Vista, had been monitored by Manchester City. No surprise to see him pitching up at one of the clubs who were part of the City Group. Tua in France. It's the Champagne region, that, isn't it? Tua. They need a Champagne moment to Ecuador. It's a strange sub that, with minutes to go, potentially, and you're well cut, bringing on a light-for-light change at right back. So he has replaced Presciardo. Very similar in that they both have the bushy hair. Claremont-Donnell follows us at five o'clock with drive. England-Wales later on five live and BBC sounds kick off at seven o'clock UK time. Four and a half minutes remain of normal time. We're going to have a tense finish here in the Kaleepa International Stadium. It's a free kick to Ecuador. It's about six yards forward of the centre circle. Platter is going to take it. Senegal have got everybody back, all in white, on the edge of their penalty area. Platter directs it towards Felix Torres. It comes off the head of the Ecuador central defender. It'll be a Senegal throw on that far side. Looking to qualify for the knockout stages since 2002 when they were under the manager, Sheepa Bruno Mezzi. As he said, he was a player in that tournament. He played four of the five games. And he's set to take them to the knockout stages unless we have a late-late goal. You're saying that one volley chance in this second half for Ecuador other than that, other than the goal. That had a lot to show. Forward ball to Enne Valencia. Comes forward to Platter. Pooks it from the right corner of the area to the edge of the box. There is Mendi. Waits for the ball to settle on the run. Volos it away. Down were Herre by Encapierre. And a free kick goes in favour of Senegal. That was Vamber de Eng who was brought to the ground. Free kick to Senegal inside the centre circle. Yeah, good play. Managed to hold off his man, get his body in the way. Just take a touch and go down and slowly, slowly kill the game. Eats up the seconds. The Netherlands are going through as Group A winners. They lead Qatar 2-0. Senegal currently are in second position with six points. And Senegal through the potential match winner of Caledu Kula Valley. As the shot is spilt by the goalkeeper and then Gallendes quickly pounces forward to gather it in at the second time of asking. But the 31-year-old central defender, his first goal for Senegal on his 67th appearance, gives Senegal the precious lead and by my watch, two minutes of normal time remain. You're listening to five live and BBC sounds. Ecuador looking for a late strike, lifted forward to Plata. Kula Valley with the valid clearance on the edge of his penalty area. Comes out to this near side. Sifuentes back with Torres. Fullbacks are pushed on both right and left, quite high. They look for Estapina on the left-hand side. He's downward header into the penalty area, cleared by a tumbling Kula Valley. Out it goes for an Ecuadorian throw. It's a bit of a feeling. It's more and more desperate now from Ecuador. Longer, longer balls. Just needs to keep the composure, create one more opening maybe. You could be looking at potential England opponents in the last 16. Not that we're getting ahead of ourselves. Estapina with the cross from the left and it was a header from Samiento. His brightened teammate that was easily saved by Edward Mendy. I've seen it before with Senegal, but the centre halves immediately drop. I say, well, I'll tell you what, you can head it from 12-13 yards because we've backed Mendy to make the save. Go on then. Always a bit of fun. I used to have a decent gauge of added on time in Champions League and Premier League matches, but this World Cup has completely skewed that now. I haven't got a scooby-doo. You could have 6 minutes, 8 minutes, 10 minutes, 12 minutes. You're going to go 8. We'll wait and see. It's a little bit like when you used to pin the tail on the donkey, wasn't it? Has it a guess? Rob Green's gone 8 minutes. Higher, lower. What was that player card drive, wasn't it? I've all given away. We'll find out now because here comes the fourth official. Oh, it's lower. It's 6. Considerably lower. I'm not going home with a cuddly toy, but if they've got 6 minutes, they're going to create one big chance, you feel, maybe, if they keep the composure, if they manage to get up the pitch. They have to get it right. Senegal have 6 minutes to secure a place in the last 16. Ecuador need a goal in that period. Estapenian forward, far side to the left. Yellowshirts, Navy Shorts, crosses, need away by Culler Valley. Lifted in towards the edge of the penalty area by Samiento. Clash of heads there, was there? Challenge has gone actually against. But also the substitute, it'll be a free kick to Senegal. They've dealt with a laces to attack. Yep, you've got 4 or 5 attacks left. Top 5s there. Seen the first one off. Take the time. Edouard Mendy, using his experience, goes to get the drink behind the goal. He's got 30 yards to run. It's a jog up to slowly launch the ball. If it is England, Senegal, I'm not sure. I don't think England have ever lost to African opposition. They certainly haven't played Senegal before, as Ecuador are attacking. Estapenian swings over a deep, deep ball from the left-hand side. It's away from Valencia. It'll be kept in play by Cifuentes, and he gets a throw on this near side, the right. 4.5 minutes remain, a minimum. Seize the coach of Senegal, looks very tense and anxious down below. Cifuentes wins a corner off Idreca Gay. It's a corner kick to Ecuador. They equalised earlier in the game to make it 1-1. With a corner on this side, they'll hope that they can defend better this time, Rob. This is their best chance for a goal. This is the best chance to stay in the World Cup, because they've shown precious little in this game, other than the one-set piece that they have had. Time is running out for Ecuador. Hernán Galandies, the Ecuadorian goalkeeper, looks like he's praying outside the centre-circle. It's a corner kick. It's delivered towards the far post, and it's clawed behind by Edouard Mendy, with his twisting body behind for another corner on that far side, the left. They were waiting behind him. He knew that they were waiting. Casado was waiting behind him, scorer of the goal. That's that space he was waiting for, the goal itself. Galandies can't look. All in blue, crouching down. We have 3 minutes remaining of stoppage time. Corner kick from the left-hand side. It's an in-swinger. Crowd of white shirts, head the ball away, repelled at the near post. Ecuador won Senegal 2, BBC Radio 5 Live. Ecuador with a throw on the left-hand side. Back to Estapinian. He'll wrap his left foot around it, and it comes from deep. Torres had stayed forward. Senegal can break. Handball surely, and it's run away anyway from Bambadien. It'll be a free kick. It was spotted by the referee, and it gives another opportunity for them to go along with a set-piece just left of the centre-circle. This is agonising for Senegal. Not that those dancers are just rocking from side to side, very, very coolly, unperturbed as the high ball in towards the penalty area. The Netherlands have beaten Cat's Art 2-0 to confirm their place as Group A winners. They will face the runners-up from England and Wales as Group. They're the fourth side to go through, joining France, Brazil and Portugal, crossed from the left. Ecuador with a flick head-up from Perotso, and the referee, Clemente Pant, has signalled that that will be a goal kick, much to the delight and relief of Senegal. There's a good ball in, a good flick on. And two, Ecuador players throw themselves on the ground because they know that they're not going to make it desperate for any decision. But you have to say, Senegal, that one slip on the set-piece. After that first 15 minutes, they've been the better side. Defensive reinforcements. Brulee Jarr is coming off. Pappé Abou Cise of Olympiacos is coming on. He's a 6'6 defender. That's what you want. There's also got goalie gloves on. That's a towering presence. So all of a sudden, the big number four, five years he spent playing in Greece. The reserve centre-back just slots in alongside Kula Bally and Diallo. Defensive reinforcements for the next 60 seconds. And that's all that remains for Senegal. And we're inside those 60 seconds as the ball is clattered long by Kula Bally, the potential match winner for Senegal. Ecuador go long, headed away by Diallo, headed further away as it goes up towards Bambadiang. Comes now out towards Cifuentes. Ecuador have it. Plata goes long. Good strong header by the new substitute Abou Cise. And then the challenge from Mending. He certainly had a good effect there since he's come onto the field of play in that holding midfield role, the Leicester City player. By my watch, we're inside the last 10 seconds. It's now or never for Ecuador. Plata hits it long. So many yellow shirts inside the penalty area. And the referee blows his whistle. There was an infringement in that penalty area. And the Senegal flags are now flying. Senegal know that their moment has almost arrived. Well, it's been all hands in a pump for the last five minutes, but you're expecting it a goal up. Such a big game for both sides that realistically, it's been hopeful for Ecuador. There's nothing they've been able to produce. That's asked any questions. Mending barely made a save in the game. I have to say, after the first two performances showed such energy and bigger, they've not really managed to reproduce it for a third time. Senegal are on the verge. Their supporters dancing in a joyous mood away towards their right-hand side now. And the Senegal players almost to a man dropped to their knees because for the first time in 20 years, Senegal for only the second time are in the knockout stages of a World Cup. And the match winner is Cooley Balli of Chelsea with his first goal for his country. And they finish as Group A runners-up. A-U-C-C was there as a player back in 2002. And he's navigated Senegal to the knockout stages now as a manager. Ecuador won, Senegal two, and who knows, even potential opponents for England. Well, they got asked the question at the start of the game. They needed to come up with an answer. They did that first 15 minutes. They didn't feel like they were at the races, they got going, and they were the better team. You have to say, on the night, they deserved the win, albeit three set pieces deciding it. And more of an idea, more of a purpose. Look to go through to the next round. They'll be watching later to see who they'll be playing. Certainly they will. Sars penalty the Watford player just before half-time gave them a 1-0 lead at the break. They were the better team. Ecuador were disappointing. Brighton's Quesido equalised midway through the second half and marked at the far post, but the Senegal response was almost immediate within two minutes. Coulomb Valley with a well-executed right-footed volley as it popped up to about eight yards out. And Senegal for the first time at a World Cup, with back-to-back wins. They were the team under pressure. They were the team that needed the victory. That's what they had to do, and they've achieved it. And so it's finished in Group A. Here in the Calipa International Stadium, Ecuador won Senegal 2, and Netherlands dropped the group with seven points, and Senegal go behind them to the group stages on 6.",
