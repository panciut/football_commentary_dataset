 Well, hopefully England will be able to breathe a little more easily here tonight at sea level away from the altitude of Rustenberg also the fact that that first game is out of the way The only green provided here this evening will be the green of Algeria Robert Green in the England goal has made way for David James after all the speculation one of three changes to the England lineup James for green the other changes Carragher in for the injured King and Barry back after injury Starting in place of Milner the England lineup is James Johnson Carragher Terry and Ashley Cole Lampard Barry Lennon Rooney Gerard and Heskey Algeria have made a couple of changes and they've also brought in two very very inexperienced players umboy in goal Who plays in Bulgaria winning only his second cap comes in for Chowchee and Budubuz is in for Djibor and he's also very Inexperienced highly thought of though only 20 plays in France for Sosho None of the Algerian starting lineup play in Algeria their lineup is umboy Yahya the captain Bugera who plays for Rangers obviously in Scotland Hallish Bell has one of the two Portsmouth players who's like Fabio Capello celebrating a birthday today 28 today Cadir Lassen Ziani the playmaker from Wolfsburg in Germany. He's got champions league experience Yeah, the other Pompey player mutt more and Budubuz the Referee is just 32 years of age Ravshan Ermitov with Speck Astan took charge of the opening game South Africa against Mexico so Chris Do you think England will be a little more relaxes evening? I would like to think so but the result in the first game didn't really go to court the plan and we thought England would have three points I've been interested to see how this to this Algerian team's been coming up on the TV monitor They've had everybody playing everywhere to me. It looks like it does look like it's rain Bellage is gonna play left wing back But at least you they've got down here as a left-sided player is gonna play in the middle of the back for her back three But saying that Bellage has gone into a four for Garrett does play right back occasionally England all in white Algeria all in green the countries have never met before England have never been beaten by an African side The referee just waiting for the go ahead to start the game Algeria remember beginning with a 1-0 defeat Against Slovenia that was a goalkeeping mistake as well and that has cost the goalkeeper Chowchi his place tonight England with so much experience in this starting lineup Seven players with over 50 caps if you're just joining our commentary on five live The headline is that David James returns to the England goal the players are looking very anxious here to start Still we wait for permission to begin this game Earlier remember Slovenia to USA to if England could win this game 2-0 They will go top of the group and actually only a draw would be necessary against Slovenia in the final game to qualify but England need to concentrate on doing the job here Still we wait Rune's looking very very impatient in this first half England here in Cape Town will play from left to right in this fantastic stadium in the city where Fabio Capello learned the draw and Thought that the draw was going to be quite benevolent and quite kind to them But after the 1-1 against the USA, it's a little more awkward away. We go finally And England try and get possession for the first time Lampar's given it away though down the far side the field It's with number 21 cad here when Ashley Cole gets an interception Chris Waddle all the time here is looking for clues to see The way that Algeria going to play But it does look as if they're going to play the players in their normal positions Algeria now building on the edge of the England penalty area. It's the new man Buddha boost turning now down that right-hand side And England have made it sluggish start here They need to get a challenger in the penalty area Ashley Cole turns away from Cadir and all he can do is find touch Well England have started poorly in recent matches in recent friendly games But already Algeria have had all of the possession from the kickoff as Bugera then Ways to pass through and David James all in yellow is not going to get his first touch He's going to take a goal kick. Well, we know we England play We've been looking at Algeria the plane of four The two in front of the back four red basically the plane of four five one and they're going to pack them in field with three They're going to let England have it and they've got Mammo up front Mammo for me was very quick in there. He has got a goal in them See Arnie who often plays in the hole behind the strikers Taking up a position at the moment down this left-hand side the ball into the man in purple for the first time in goal And boy making his first start That's quite an ask isn't it in the World Cup and he clears now right footed into the England half Carragall will try and win the header in fact It's beaten everybody and it goes through once more to David James England looking to put their first real Moves together here in this game in Cape Town on five live Glenn Johnson below on the England right ball played in Towards Heskey. It wasn't well delivered by Johnson though Halisha against Heskey and it's gone through once more to the Algerian key That's two deliveries wasn't it Garith Barry played one through to the goal keep on Ben Johnson I still think England they've got a little bit of nerves about Well, we've seen it so many times if only England could just settle down if they once more are gripped by tension Perhaps they haven't been helped by the late announcement once more all the team that just to repeat once more Gerard is now back on that left Sided position with license to Rome. It's Rooney and Heskey Lenin to the right Lampard and particularly Barry at the sitting players in midfield and England now looking to try and settle down here fantastic support wonderful Mild evening for them no excuses really as Ashley Cole now has possession and the board is played by Barry to Rooney for the first time Rooney up against Baguio Ashley Cole tumbles over out of play think he's got a free kick over on the far side Baguio was the man who was guilty So here's a chance for England to test the Algerian defenders certainly the goalkeeper who played before Chouchi was a bit of a flapper in Goal here's a chance now for Gerard to put one in and try and travel Umboy on his first start Rooney and Heskey on the edge of the area and now a late run from John Terry Remember England started well with an early goal against the USA Steven Gerard then with a free kick for England looking for Heskey Algeria trying to clear here still inside the penalty area now perhaps a counterattack on for them as Bugira knocks it forward But it was well read by Gareth Barry then in comes a lunging challenge over on the far side referee was happy with it though And it's a throw in only to Algeria and it's about ten yards from the half wayline It was a nice pass from Gareth Barry a few months ago Not such a good touch on the ball though now from Bugira England have a throw in far side the left nil nil I'm still trying to work out. They are tight three at the back I've got to say cadieres coming back and picking Gerard up and Bellard just playing on the left side come come full back Come wing back Well, both of these coaches will have done piles of homework coming into this matches down John Terry Bringland tries to steer the ball forward in England looking to settle their nerves down And it's Steven Gerard now with a high one and it's too high towards the goalkeeper But he was backtracking a bit there his positioning wasn't great and he had to stretch and in the end It was a clean catch for the new man umboy in the Algeria goal. I wasn't convinced It wasn't I thought it just got past him, but he held on to it Algeria getting plenty of men back behind the ball as they now try and build in midfield It's with Belhage the Portsmouth left back Algeria motioning immediately Instinctively to go backwards once more and a clearance as a terrible clearance from the goalkeeper that can Rooney take advantage two defenders in his way Rooney finds Gerard. Oh Gerard tried to return it to Lampard instead of having a crack himself and Algeria let off the hook there But that was a terribly nervous clearance by the goalkeeper umboy England ill Algeria nil on five live Algeria now trying to escape England having to backtrack They've got speedy players in midfield and it's an excellent run down the far side by Muckmore England just for the moment out of position Matt Moore drives it back Boota Boos was almost there England got a foot in and that was a very very Pacy counterattack there from Algeria. Well, that's how England get caught out Don't know was it says the Arnie will pick it up terrific running release man boy. He should have hit it He should have hit it the young boy Algeria throwing number 21 Caddier to take it far side the right on to the 20 year old Boota Boos a good ball into the unmarked player in midfield whose shot is charged down and now Glenn Johnson looking to try and bring some Star to the England side is put one down this right hand side for Heskey to chase Heskey turning with a defender try to play it into Iron Lennon Johnson fails to get possession on the half wayline and it's back inside the England half once more with Carragher England They're Algeria nil but just a couple of moments on the break already for me Algerians to show that they are very quick on the counterattack most of these players French French born opted to play for Algeria 17 in the squad Born in France Ashley Cole now cutting it for England down the left-hand side appeal the handball there against the defender But cleared by Algeria Ashley Cole made a really good run and so Gerard will have to cover now over on the left-hand side Cole under Gerard there together John Terry was there as well And so instinctively when Ashley Cole went forward Gerard filled in now to put this good movement Ashley Cole's got forward well I'm trying to get Lenin and Heskey's got looked after ball a little bit better already give it away cheaply Oh nice pass there by Barry, but Rooney couldn't take it and bell has now Feeds buggera and buggera all on his own at the moment brings it forward and then Algeria looked to map more inside the centre circle Algeria playing from right to left here a ball to this near side towards the Arnie can't control it though with his head And it's going to be an England throw England still haven't settled down yet completely and a couple of times Algeria Have been neat and quick on the break So there could be some testing moments for John Terry and Jamie Carragher Gareth Barry certainly will be needed on his return to try and give some protection to the back for you Listen to five live at the World Cup the final game of this day England nil Algeria nil England second game in the group. It's a must-win game really now as Gerard tries to cut the ball out over on the far side The field it's with number seven Buddha booths turning around Gareth Barry Decent pass here from Matt Moore Matt Moore now on to the Arnie's You're not he's just forced to go square Johnson harrying him well But now the Arnie goes forward once more and Lenin has conceded a corner Algeria's first near side the left Selling what makes so far I'll do a little very dangerous out of it They're very comfortable in possession one and two to a sport what they've got a bit of pace about them as well And they have their first corner And it's going to be taken by the Arnie It's a dreadful corner and Gerard at the near post will stab it clear so no testing moment there for David James And that was a big opportunity wasted by Algeria nil nil here in Cape Town Throw in now and the ball lifted into the England penalty area John Terry climbs But Algeria still have possession down that right-hand side It's Kadir playing over on the right up against Ashley Cole ball back again with Buddha booths Some good movement at times here from the North African side ball now into the England penalty area Which Johnson can leave and it's going to be a goal kick but already only seven minutes gone We've seen enough here of Algeria to illustrate that they could be a handful I think they are who the bulls are start the game for a young lad very very well technically excellent And as I say they've got a bit of pace about them So when England do lose a position high up the field there is Gupt and they're filling their midfield to yet Doris he is just controlling that Central area in front of the back four and England yet to really build up a momentum here in Cape Town Lampard for England good ball now on to Barry now can Barry play it to this right-hand side Johnson's there now he almost stumbled but now Johnson can play it in towards Lenin and it goes off the defender Halleesh Not just to be a back pass he got his put in and goalkeeper number 23 Umbo is there to throw to the far side the field to the captain yeah here He was the man who got the goal against Egypt in the playoff game in Sudan now It's Yebda of Portsmouth to the unmarked Buddha booth England need to tighten up a bit in midfield Funding it hard here at times England getting out numbered a little bit in that middle area as the Arnie now Chases across to the far side the field and England managed to dispossess him fine work from there from Jamie Carragher Carragher turns Barry's touch has to be good here because he's surrounded by Algerian players and that's a thing about them They do hunt the ball well in numbers a very athletic team as well but England will be looking to try and trouble them at the other end of the field because Over the seasons they have proved to be suspect especially when the ball is put into the air in the power runy really struggling to get into game here Minute is that the ball went to him. He was surrounded by green shirts one of the Algerian players has gone down the goalkeeper though Launches it long and it's going to be a goal kick for England. They haven't stopped the game here At the moment, they're just a few problems in that center of the field for England Well, there is they're getting good possession in the move on the ball very very well I think the ideal scenario files years raining didn't do get in the final third That's when they want to pinch the ball and that's when they've looked dangerous Well, we're looking here for Wade Rooney to explode in the world cup. He's made a quietish start here today Just as he did against the USA, but we've only played just under 10 minutes now lampard near side down the line poor ball And that really just should have found its target Johnson It didn't and it was sloppy and careless there by England who still seem to be showing just a little too much Apprehension here in the first 10 minutes the results have gone their way so far today the 2-2 between America and Serbia Hesky now trying to win a corner kick and he hasn't quite got it. It's a goal kick to Algeria They want to play every time they get it there throw in Bellagio through it. He was marked by Hesky was a risky throw That's how they play they like the plate defeat. They've got good movement all technically very good But as you say discipline at the back in mark and it seems has let them down Well, there are real mix of course, Algeria a North African team playing here in South Africa Arab culture and European born players essentially that most of these players have grown up in France Perhaps realize that they weren't going to get into the French national side But they've every chance here with Algeria and they've started well But now Gerard inside the centre circle England need a bit more urgency Rooney's given it away Should have returned the past deceiving Gerard and Rooney's touch so far letting him down as now Bugira plays it down the right-hand side for Algeria Cross comes actually cold to try and cut out the danger But he hasn't and now the ball is lifted in first testing moments with David Jones with one fist He was late coming for it and England and a pickle here in the penalty area all because of a weak punch from David James That wasn't convincing now England find Rooney and now Rooney with a good ball for the first time finds Lenin on this near side And it's England counter-attacking Lenin now lays the ball off to this near side Johnson onto Hesky Rooney's in the penalty area Hesky looks up wins in the end only a corner and he might have got it in earlier for Wayne Rooney I was just gonna say the same words mate. You had time to put it in he got it on his feet Just put it in with pace a bit of a delivery Desitated they've got a corner. This is where I think England can catch the state Oh, we're always picked a lot of the big players the tall players in the Algerian squad This is where I think England may catch these out. Well, the longer the game goes on Algeria will grow more and more confident here This would be a good time for England to strike from this first corner kick of the evening to try and test the new Inexperienced goalkeeper Gareth Barry with a free kick goalkeeper doesn't come for it And Hesky rose almost too high But I think he's been penalized anyway for pushing and he headed it well over and it's a goalkeeper The keeper there was completely rooted at the spot. He wasn't gonna come for it But in the end Hesky was pulled up by the officials here. He's all over Bulgaria And Rooney was in there as well, but high over the bone but England have in recent games works that pieces very well Well, England are back in the the system that served them well in the qualifying campaign With Gerard on the left cutting in trying to link with Rooney. Hesky's there as well Gareth Barry protecting but they still haven't settled yet and they're looking to the big players here to stamp their authority Men like Frank Lampard is on the ball now Lampard sends it to the far side the field to his Chelsea Captain John Terry Terry now on to Gareth Barry Barry with his left foot long ball looking for Ashley Cole And he's been over hit has it Ashley Cole can't get there by the corner flag And they still haven't got the measure of this sir this Jabalani ball I don't really think it's the ball I think you know it tends to show everybody was played short for ball of ad result So to our class these pitches away the water them and there with the ball. It's like playing an astroturf. You've got to play it a feet Jerry clear at nil nil 13 minutes gone in the first half here and a llama few moments ago with a Unconvincing punch from David James restored to the England lineup and England now looking for some inspiration here And certainly they need to climb up a gear or two here So it's been a slow staccato beginning from England once more looking a little bit apprehensive a little bit edgies Hesky's been fouled and the free kick is quickly taken referees let them do it and then Lampard expecting Lenin to make the run Played it to the right hand side and gave the ball away Hesky slow to get back up on his feet again and England didn't benefit from that quickly taken free kick as Halish now It's a good long ball to the far side of the field Algeria neat and tidy and composed They haven't got a really dangerous striker up front They've certainly runners coming through for midfield to try and test the England defenders neat ball in now for towards the Arney who's While in the end or a free says manhandled by Johnson free kick He allows Algeria to take quickly too and there's a nice change of pace here And then the shot is driven in from Buddha booze and it's worldwide. It was very very ambitious So almost 15 minutes gone in the first half. Let's get some thoughts from Graham Taylor Who's alongside us here tonight Graham? I have to say I like the formation that Algeria playing It's three at the back sometimes. It's five and when they push forward They've not outnumbered in midfield if they had a main threat as in the centre forward position I think they would have given England even more problems than they have done at the present time I think they've been impressive England are taking some time to settle into this Our own London after England bustling forward Lenin's ball and then Gerard swept it forward early and over But the problem here for England and Algeria had done some homework. No question. They're filling midfield They're going to be hard to break down and then on the counterattack. They're very quick on the break So there are problems here for Fabio Capello and England to try and solve. I think the pushing in I think that the object of playing the three goes into a four when Baladjou they're trying really just to push on to Lenin Push on to Gerard so they don't get the balls of fate and they're making England really force it and play longer balls England nil Algeria nil in this Huge game really because the second game Really can affect the shape the entire shape of the qualifying group England really have to win it Otherwise, it's going to be enormous pressure going into the final match It's nil nil and you're listening to five live and it's Jamie Carragher of England this time on to feet It'll spin from Lenin need more conviction than that and then and gave it away straight away They'll hash was there in a dangerous fallback almost putting the defender Hallease into problems England trying to win it back and this is what Capello wants He wants them to hunt the ball back in midfield as well when they give it away And again some of the passing early on here from England has been careless. There's a lot of Finger pointing down there by Stuart Pierce alongside Fabio Pello Algeria looking to try and play a one-two on the edge of the area Johnson gives it back to James and James clearance wasn't very good. It's straight back to Algeria once more and Ziani and that's good pace from Ziani to get away from Johnson dangerous ball in Barry was back inside the penalty area England haven't cleared it ball played in again by Ziani. Oh, and that was Frank it was Jamie Carragher who had a go at it and tell you what if he'd made contact with that That could have been problems for his own goalkeeper had he made any kind of Interceptionary he would have perhaps sliced that over James England lucky and the throw into Algeria again far side and still England in this performance are starting slowly too slowly our thoughts. Ziani got wrong then jump very very easy He didn't do a trick was just pace push the ball and run They look very nervous at the back England still look there's not a lot confidence though the ball's going everywhere It doesn't seem to be a leader there not treating the ball as a friend at the moment giving it away cheaply another ball into the England penalty And even that was an edgy header away by Jamie Carragher He could have got more distance with it and said he's headed its sideways out of play and Algeria have more Possession near side. It's Ziani Ziani back to the half wayline and the centre back Hallease Hallease is ball in which I'm not sure Terry needed to head there But there wasn't much communication with the goalkeeper because I don't suppose they play together much in training and now another ball back into The England area which James allows to bounce and then scuffs it back towards the centre circle and England at the moment a little shapeless And they need something here. Well, they need to make it happen for themselves Algeria lose out in midfield Barry strives forward But it's a good challenge back on Gareth Barry and Algeria very quick to recover when it back once more Algeria getting more possession Number 15 is Ziani another nice change of pace a shake of the hips to get around Johnson And that was approved by the Algerian fans and these are worrying moments here for Fabio Capello in England There's now Matt Moore 30 yards away from James goal. He shot his charge down by Carragher But the ball is coming back to the men in green most of the time down that far side It's Bagheera against Heskey England at the moment a second best Heskey trying to find Gerard now can the captain lift England Gerard onto Lampard lamp of sees Lenin Rooney drops forward Lenin goes inside the Algerian half Aaron Lenin now trying to show some pace here It's Gerard at the centre of midfield with a terrible pass which Bagheera clears It was snatched up that was by Gerard without any composure 80 and a half minutes gone it's nil nil and here come Algeria once more Carragher trying to Hold up Matt Moore near side and Algeria win the thread got the same mate Algeria are by far the better side that they're compact the playing together They all know what you those game is and the move in the ball excellent wanted to touch They've got a lot of legs and a lot of pace in this side. They're causing so many problems England look anxious England look nervy as the ball comes into the England area and Terry's head are away wasn't great shot driven in from Algeria Could have gone anywhere England failing to clear it slow to react there was Lenin Fabio Capello is prowling down there not happy It's the army for Algeria Algeria's ball into the England penalty area had her on and James is there and we were looking for huge improvement here tonight from England and Capello, I think is just telling James to calm down don't launch it and lose it keep it 19 minutes gone Lenin again now near side the right We've seen almost nothing of Wayne Rooney in these opening 20 minutes It's lampard to Barry Barry now to Rooney Rooney gave it early Gerard went forward and he was caught Gerard in full flight was caught and it's a free kick to England But it's at least 35 most 40 yards away from the Algeria That's the benefit you get a Gerard when he comes inside there's no doubt about that But it's the first real team I think England has strung three or four and I'm one of our quick passes and a bit of movement Gerard now following the free kick and nice touch from Rooney on the edge of the area Rooney trying to make an angle from shot and hit a defender It took all the sting out of it and it drops to the goalkeeper the interesting thing would be to see here Even England would have be able to go in front what effect that would have on the Algerian team But at the moment that's a long way from happening Algeria posing most of the dangers now Johnson bolleys the ball into the center circle England are giving it away too much straight back once more to the opposition Bell has nearside. This is the Algerian left England ill Algerian ill on five live Johnson with a header up against Siani who's given him quite a few problems in the opening 20 minutes and the the North Africans have a threat Gotta give the culture fair Algeria No, I looked to a great coming at this tournament that did okay against Slovenia in the first game nothing but tonight They've actually got the system right. Oh, we always in the break together high studs by yeah Lampard, but you've got to say Algeria by the team. Oh really? I'll pass the ball around look and threaten it if they come again down the right-hand side England now having to get players back But they're not picking up the Algerian players when they come forward and Bulgaria the center back is now Deep inside the England half, but he shows too much of that to Gareth Barry Barry wants to clear and gets a reasonable clearance in towards the advertising board over on the far side England haven't settled and we played almost a quarter of the game Here come the Algerians once more and they may get a shot in here driven and it was well defended though by John Terry England just can't get hold of the ball here It's Gerard against a Kedir over on the right-hand side another ball played in the England penalty area now Matt Moore gives it back and now lovely play from Algeria a drag back there Nobody really marking up for England on the edge of the penalty area comes out of play yet I can't get it England have a throw in and Capallo standing down there Arms folded and now motioning to Wayne Rooney England looking to their big stars here to impose themselves Lampard Jerry Gerard and Rooney in particular, but they're not getting enough of the ball here Even England mess the throw in up Halish now ball to this near side which Johnson lets travel forward and It hits the corner flag and stays in play Carragher has to be quick here to react Carragher's ball in the end is shoveled out of play for an Algeria throw in Halfway inside the England half troubling times here, but it is still nil nil ball with bell has you just pinching a few yards down This near side to take the throw in Carragher now trying to mark up on the edge of the penalty area But Matt Moore is dangerous and Carragher hasn't managed to get it away still danger here bell has with across to the far post Too deep for any Algerian players. It's the halfway point of the first half. It's nil nil and here now comes Alan Green As we hear across the ball into the penalty area yep diggers is right put to it But it's a high log really it's taking the reflection. It's gonna be a corner I think they come on John Terry terrific ball in by McGehran. It's all not cheer you got to say It's got a body who plays it away, but it's the same problem we had in When we played at Russamberg against America We don't pick up second balls the dominating midfield which America did and it's always difficult It's basically at the minute I play on the counter attack and I'm not getting any joy England are Atrocious so far Maybe simply they're not remotely as good as we thought they were Algeria corner taken by bell had left footed ensuing good catch by David James Fantastic catch to a Algerian players attacking it kept his eye on it terrific catch and England got a start getting We've got to see lump on bar to get on the ball. There's nobody getting on the ball Here's Johnson to Barry Barry just short of the center circle Terry to his left Barry moves forward finds the captain Gerard Rooney to the right on it goes to the United Striker Rooney with a cross looking for has he who tries to chest it in the direction of lump on got it wrong And it's taken away by Yebda Algeria much the better team at the moment it's fed down the right side towards Cadier with Cole got their first the pass back to James and James Slices the clearance up over the halfway line good header a defensive header to the left-hand side to bell hatch Into the ante the ante fancies running at Johnson's already shown he could beat him easily Johnson Try to track him away from the danger area And there's a back heel from Ziani and I said a play this is a team what's been struggling and how confident are these they are so Compact they've worked hard. They know when you play English English team. You've got a work hard There's no doubt about that, but technically they are far superior. I can't think of an England player. He's playing remotely well at the moment Barry caught a possession there. No infringement even it was lampart actually lampart thought it was it should have been a free kick Against Algeria, but it's not bell. Hi to yeah, yeah the captain Under pressure but flicks it to the halfway line Ziani and Ziani with a crossfield ball accurately hit cut out though by Ashley Cole Cole to let a new pops up on the left side now and is Ineffective so far as he was against the United States hardly in the game Well, we're just trying to get a shape ruin. He's not getting in the game can't get any supply Heskey's just getting out of muscle grays not won anything Barry and lampart I'm touch the ball and they're not picking any second balls at edges chasing green shirts at the minute Free kick taken for England. That's a Barry Barry approaching the penalty Yeah, over hits the cross high and wide and out it goes for a throw in It's awful. Well, you want Gerard loose Allen and he's got that freedom But they just can't get the ball to him and then when he's come inside I'll do you are picking all the balls up and they've got an outlet every time on the right with Kedah and you just get out easy There's no pressure Ziani back to bell Hodge after the throw and it's whacked up field and that Terry allows it to clear his head Through today with James. We thankfully settled on after that flopping punch in the early stages of the game We played nearly 26 minutes here in Cape Town You listen to five live in the BBC England ill Algeria no and trust me. We're not worth no no Barry to runy runies on the halfway line here Gets into Gerard runy gets further forward where he should be Gerard's past to the right to Johnson good control by Johnson edge of the penalty I'm letting casual little flick to new a good avail at all and it's easily cleared by Algeria Ziani back to bell Hodge and bell Hodge just steps away from Lenin Bell Hodge fixing in the danger area. Heskey might be there. So do his Gerard was their trip ball breaks at runy Runy just pushed away by Baguera and it's behind. I told a pretty kick. He's given against runy I'd say what bell Hodge? I've watched him and it's three times. He's passed balls into the box He's not looking obviously for me. He's putting these defenders into so much pressure. He's just got to play and say it off forward The thing is I honestly don't think they're that good. I mean, I really don't make them look good I think they've been good on the eye the movements excellent technically the brilliant Capello's look Shows a thousand stories as Algeria take a free kick putting them in the ball back here is Heskey Heskey Oh I'm all according to the linesman Heskey feels that his shirt was being pulled Capello laughs now you can see though why people are saying play runy up front and Play next to midfield man because we can't get any control of this game It ain't working Capello should know it Yahya takes the free kick drives it towards the far side I could hear keeps it a play close to the corner fly cross on to the penalty area cleared on the half folly By Barry and who's the England player down injured? I wrote No, it's it's not it's very it's Terry Well, I don't see how because the roll ball gets rolled back. He's coming late. I think Bulgaria's trod on him accidentally It didn't look any anything that he meant it I Grunt Taylor is um, oh a bit further away than normal. He's about ten yards away Graham doesn't look any better from your perspective. I'm gonna say Alan it doesn't I have to say I mean press with how Algeria Have played I mean press with how they use their formation, but they actually are out numbering England in all the vital parts of the pitch They're keeping the ball well the one big factor or there's two in England's favor is one Algeria Don't seem to have an end product and the other thing is they will give the ball away now and again in dangerous parts of the field Which can help England but at the present time We've gone a long way through the first half and Algeria have been by far the better side Thanks, Graham Terry seem to get a crack at the head there which he feels the linesman should have spotted He's received treatment. He's back on the pitch and Algeria have the play The ball rather yeah, yeah A buckham to bell had in the near side of the field and in to Lassen on to bell Hodge need football from the North African side and then to Ziani, but Ziani off side and it's a free kick to England Well, Bell Hodge was in a fantastic position here wasn't he just so unlamely in your box He's looking in the box not one player Matt board come out. We wanted to defeat everybody the Ziani They all wanted to feet sometimes if you just get a couple of players gambling in that box and get the ball in Nobody in the box. It's all for them. Do it gets me. It's the lack of momentum and pace in the England display so far You know watching Italy the other night, okay? They only drew the game, but they were quick and they played defeat and England are just not at the game at the moment Despite the fans trying to lift them barring to Gerard and Gerard to runy back to Gerard This is a little bit better jargon forward Gerard should slow straight at the goalkeeper easy save easy save Pitch just in front of me did well low goalkeeper just to keep hold of it We've seen many spill in this tournament so far that desire on it got it in his chest to hands wrap reindeer a little bit better That's Gerard linking up with runy but wiring is so slow You know, they can't point to heat the temperatures absolutely perfect tonight in gate time Heskey plays the ball to lampart and lampart and Johnson Johnson with a bit of room down the right side early cross Hydro Hotsheski good header away by Baguera and I started play for an Indian throw Coach has got a big back three there hasn't he the three boys at the back up big and it's gonna have to be a very good delivery for some Even in England to get ahead on it again clears actually cold with a throw into Barry in night to runy 30 awesome Gold runy boots one defender plays in the lamp bar back towards runy Too long and it's behind for a goalkeeper. I think front lamp on wanted it on his right foot there Didn't he just scooped it with his left foot soon as it hits the surface So we've seen it every game the ball skids away and that's why the teams are thinking we passed the feet of other success But I'm just look around the white shirts and I'm thinking are you playing well? Not one of them not one It's a really poor display by England There's a file by Cadier on Terry free kick taken runy Couldn't keep possession runies not just not involved in the game That's a good ball to the left side towards Bellard. Bellard just quick enough to get there Closer the corner flag turns one way then the other beats Letting easily and then the cross bounces in front of James who catches well Bellard He's unfortunately was a slight deflection on the cross for him But he's one of the two boys who are in the box who've made the ground up to gambling company a post the very static I'll hear when they get in the box no movement. Here's the Annie As the Annie cutting in feel away from Johnson, but Heskey was tracking back. Well done. They mill Heskey Johnson was far too easily beaten defensively and now it is Johnson who plays it back to James James plays it upfield 31 and a half minutes gone here in Cape Town beautiful green point stadium, but a Very ugly England display so far, but here's runy No, no in Cape Town runy slips You know something it's nothing against the United States not Wembley. This is it. No, no, it's not nothing wrong with it Green does well with the ball back Plays it to Barry and now lamp are Jeremy's in a good position Jared takes a possession and on it goes to Lenin. What a bit of decent cross our Lenin Lenin from the right whips it in towards the Nürburgring Head of John just for lamp art lamp are short saved Well, it was a good effort lamp on we see through a week in week out in a Chelsea shirt gets in the box very very well And he's just snatched on it with his left foot But give this goalkeeper credit who stepped into night they held it again But that's where the difference between the two sides are when England do get upfield They do have a lot of weight shirts in the box where we've seen Algeria They don't want to put people in the box and that's why they're not going to score goals Remember earlier in the same group it finished Slovenia to the United States to Slovenia top the group at the moment with four points the US of two England will have won Algeria no But you don't need for goodness sake surely we can beat Algeria You know all the hype about what England we're gonna do in this tournament and so far it's been a shambles I Should remind you that in 1990 as you know well Chris England didn't win either of their opening two games And of course went on to the semi-final That's a very powerful back pass by Barry good control by James. I was more like a shot by Gareth Barry James hits the clearance upfield Heskey heads it toward Gerard, but Heskey a judge to have filed the Algerian. That's a free kick To the North African side Much the better team they are they are as I said They just got nothing in the final third or getting players in the box of quality Anything up to there. You've got to say a dominated this game Halleesh takes the free kick and it's now with Lassen on to Bell hatch Lassen once more Back to Halleesh And plenty of time to clear the ball left footed upfield towards Matt Moore Matt Moore with a header in field Terry reacts plays it back to Carragher back at goes to James. That didn't look convincing defending by England James clearance Heskey chess it but only to Carter on the far side of the bill brother was but it goes But it was again running away from Gerard and then Barry gets in a challenge. Gerard takes it up for England Really poor so far from Capello's team Lenin on the half way line back to Johnson and and now Barry again We thought the return of Barry would be influential releasing Gerard and lamp bar to more attacking roles Not so far. It has a Lenin to Gerard and now Barry Barry falls over and there wasn't a file Referee's quite right Barry I think made of a problem now, but England have a problem defensively Ziani breaking forward up to the edge of the England penalty on those right foot shoots wide Barry okay, Barry's limping a little bit. We've got to watch that ankle But again caught in possession not enough movements very sluggish And they break quick the on is being a handful for Glenn Johnson comes inside ideally He's got to hit at the other corner. He's gone near post never going to be David James there Is there a redeeming feature of the England display so far? No, I've struggled. What is it now 35 minutes gone and One shot from lampart really of any worthwhile effort Yet you're gonna say well David James hasn't really been trouble But just in possession in the way they've played I'll do you have just controlled the game remember the lines I'll be opening about 20 minutes time for 606 which I'll present here from Cape Town 0 500 9 0 9 6 9 3 At the moment I promise it to be an absolutely miserable experience presenting that program England are awful Typified by that pass by Barry and our Prince's Harry and William don't look happy either Nobody come to watch this little dribble All cleared to the far side for Algea great control by Carter Carter on the halfway line left for Yevda Yevda right of the center circle map move with a movement upfield Cadillac has it now Why to Buddha boo Buddha booze and it's how to play off actually call for a throw into Algeria Clueless we look absolutely clueless shapeless Here's Rooney winning the ball slipping again get popper studs way Rooney In now to lampard lampard on towards Lenin the past was overhead half cleared picked up by Heskey couldn't control it And I started playing for throw in England Bellard has been caught out there with a slowly back pass or sloppy pass or China played little passes it seems and that's three teams now Glenn Johnson to take the throw in for England up over the edge of the Algeria penalty area To Lenin back to Johnson Johnson crosses into the penalty area half cleared Jared on the volley right foot So high it almost took the clouds Well, it's just not happened. I was 36 the good thing for him. It is they're not a goal behind They haven't they haven't deserved anything. Rightly so what you're saying, but they're not a goal down and hopefully He can sort it out as off-time because as you say it's a poor performance. Can I pose a question? Um from my opening team sheet for the u.s. Game. I had dual call in the England team How can dual call lock it into this team? What has Lenin done at the moment to justify starting either game? Here's Karagap deputizing for ledley king up to the halfway line And he plays it back 20 yards to Terry and all the way back it goes to James James now with his right foot dispatches the ball high towards Heskey who jumps well chests it down controls it finds lampard Lampard to Barry good run by Ashley cold on the left Barry ignores it Plays it back to Terry onto Barry Ashley calls the water. Why did I bother? Here's lampard lampart to the right side and Lenin controlling it decent cross iron Lenin though rushes forward moves in field plays it back Barry shapers of the shoot changing my nice shoot straight at the goalkeeper Well, very predictable Insta kept the ball a little bit better with shown Lenin inside That's where you won't Lenin really for me when he's coming with that pace just to look to try and dink it in Heskey for a one two he's played it to Barry Not a clean strike and an easy save again for the goalkeeper seven minutes to half time at five live England nil Algeria nil Terry forward to Gerard and Gerard with a good pass to Rooney Rooney not rushing forward But beyond the defender a good challenge came in but it's behind for corners and no the referee's giving a free kick against Rooney I tell you what could the other thing terrific place back there didn't he the young boy What a great change of pace because there Rooney is very quick But he's not in the game I always find it hard to get space and when he's got it he doesn't seem to have anybody to play with He just seems to be running down cul-de-sacs at the minute And boy the goalkeeper takes the goal kick and Terry completely misjudged The jump for the header was looking to get away with it. Here's Ashley Cole Terry again onto Gerard down the left into Terry Terry's passed to Rooney on the halfway line immediately But Garag gets in close but Rooney does well flicking it to the right side and here's Glenn Johnson plenty of room to move forward for England He plays it to Heskey Heskey further upfield Heskey's crossed into the penalty here challenged by the defender puts it behind Off a leash for a corner. Yep good defender. No it's a throw in. No throwing sorry With Johnson takes To Lampard back to Johnson and another throw in is the result to England No threat being carried at all by those in white So far it can only improve surely here's Barry Gerard available It's back to Gerard on now to Lampard Gerard keeps running forward. It goes to Lenin and Lenin never looked Gives the ball away shocking Far side of the field Kadeir I don't want to pick on just one player because they're all bad But I can't see any contribution that are in Lenin's making in the moment Here's Yebda back to Begir and into Halleesh They look so comfortable. Well, maybe they don't work on a system You know, we don't see the team till two hours before kickoff So maybe they don't work on a system. They just put the team and say this is how we're going to play in a bit of paper And the difference after Alger just look at saying they all know what they're doing the movements excellent They've got when they give the ball to someone they know something's going to happen the next player moves. We're England. They're all static Is he any can't find Matt Moore. It's had a play for a throw in. It's not a great game actually, is it? Super Have you seen the Deeks match yet Chris the World Cup? No Same with me I'm particularly not watching England Barry to Gerard Gerard gets it to Lampard Why to Johnson for most a halftime at five line England ill Algeria ill Johnson back to Carragher And on to Terry in the far side of the field. It's so slow Barry To Lampard just over the halfway line back to Carragher and to Terry again. Did we start there a minute ago? Have we moved forward properly? nice with Rooney to Terry to Lampard 20 yards over the halfway line John Terry is now up alongside him to the left on to Ashley Cole A one-two attempted there didn't come off Terry's pass wasn't good and Perker just shepherds the ball behind for a goal kick That's very slow and run out of ideas not enough movement And something I like I'd like to see me keep the ball a bit more and move it But then they've got to move it a little bit quicker and what they are there You know, why why'd you play two? Well, well definitely one way man if you can't get you've got to switch the ball early to wait man There is nothing good that can be said about this England display so far three minutes left until the interval here in Cape Town Beautiful Cape Town today glorious weather totally against the forecast that we were led to believe would be pertinent Here's that Carragher with a pass back to David James James controls the ball all in yellow Then it's on to John Terry Ashley Cole to his left in field it's Gerard inside the center circle to Terry Gerard again Still inside the England half better ball forward to Rooney Rooney almost missed control of it did well finds glenn johnson running forward Johnson moving in field without great conviction but gets it back to Rooney Rooney should have 30 yards easily saved So what the goalie's doing well. I know they look easy these boards are pitching them just in front of them and Everyone he's kept a hold off very very well and I like to say it He's setting example to Robert Green, you know get your body behind the ball And he's only a kid He's yabba over the halfway line And that's a A ball to a faster player in an obvious offside position free kick England Gerard to Barry Barry back to Carragher Two minutes of this torture to endure before we have the halftime interval When one would hope that Capello could change things James clatters it up here Heskey jumps loses at it where the ball is now he sees it brings it under control Near the right touch line and then he's tackled it's out for an England throw in Pedestrian England boring England Charlotte Beckham might have noted off there in the touch line Barry runs forward loses it cleared over the halfway line by Algeria and it is I think it's the worst game I've seen in the World Cup Shocking Worse even than Ivory Coast in Portugal, which is saying something England and no rush to take this throw in we're inside the final minute of the first half You know Capello picked the team He picks the tactics Presumably they've been practicing the tactics, but you don't know if they don't know the team until two hours before kickoff Heskey with the header to Lenin then over the back heel again far too casual straight to Halish All night to Matmore and Matmore plays it to the right side Here's Cadir Cadir on towards Matmore good challenge by Carragher and it's out of playing the far side of the field for throwing Well, I gotta say the Algerian coach will be delayed the way they've looked after the ball Obviously no cutting edge in the final third. That's good news for England, but um England Capello, where does he start? Where does he start? Well, it'd be nice to see the old player playing well lampard intercepts an attempt to clearance runy Just easily challenged and loses the ball Where's the world class Wayne runy? Haven't seen it so far here in South Africa Terry stretches finds Cole Cole almost puts Barry under pressure in fact. He did put Barry under pressure Algeria had the ball back bell hatch midway inside being on half turning back Dinked it into Yevda. Yevda attempting to play a one two. It's now with Ziani who has moved from left to right He plays the ball back into his own half. We're into time added on for stoppages. I didn't see it for the official One minute has been added on of this torture And it's not too strong a word particularly from an England perspective. They've been awful Ball might break to runy. Runy doesn't rush to get it. He looks disinterested their way in runy Now bell hatch rushes forward down the left side. He's going to run down to play doors The line lines went surely single. Yes, it's a throw into England. Well I just think the big problem we've got is we don't pick up second boards. We don't keep the ball We don't play quick enough. We don't know what's all the help but the two boys in midfield They don't move the ball quick enough. They don't look forward. They don't look weighed It sort of comes into them in the one it they get it and then haven't got a picture in their eyes And they turn back and go back to Carragher in John Terry. What are you going to do with it? It's in complete contrast to the way Italy ushered the ball around quickly And there's the halftime whistle Shocking absolutely shopping Chris. Well, he's got to change it. I don't think the crowd's too up yet and I don't know how he's going to change it. Yes, you can look at Joe Colley. You look whoever you like at the minute It's about tempo and looking forward having a picture when it comes to you two boys in midfield have slowed it down too much Never looked forward at all. Gerald is wandering around now And uh, you've got to say I'll give you have had the best shape and technically they've been the best team What can you say? No, no Well, I thought the moment in the first half which summed up England mark tonight Was the chance that fell to frank lampard He's facing to be grip with tension And he scuffed it without any conviction had he been playing in the blue of chelsea He would have closed his eyes and swept it home That's what england are searching for here Club form at international level As the sides take the field for the second half egypt mexico japan even platinum stars usa and now algeria All the games of this year so far a non-performance in the first half Fabio Cappello The most highly paid international manager around the world has to come up with some answers here He's going to start the way that he Began the game with this england lineup James johnson karigatarian dashley coal lampard barry lenin runey gerrod and heskey Lenin won't be given a long adept thinking this second half And uh, that's the england lineup the england team Completely unable to come to terms with a an algurian system Which is sort of three four two one which has caused all sorts of problems And the algurian lineup of boy burgira haleesh yahir second half just begins Kadea yabda bel haj budaboo's lassan ziani mattmore The speckastan referee had a very easy first half really No Moments to clear up in england now. How will they react the crowd are trying to respond immediately? Is terry finds lampard england in the second half play from right to left the first half Much worse than the performers against the usa Johnson's ball in that england now looked to runey. What's more runey though? Who's his touches lacking him down here england need just To get forward and build up some momentum here need a bit more urgency Need to hunt the ball back quicker need to hold on to it when they get it And now it's kadea all in green down the algurian right near side into yabda yabda is not venturing very far forward He's just anchoring in the center there of midfield Algiria at least haven't got a striker to troubling them so far as lampard tries to get the ball through to wane runey It's gone down under the challenge runey looked to the referee perhaps for a free kick and algiria play on chris waddle for the first time In this second half. I haven't really started any tempo different from what they did in the first half same shape And luckily enough as I said for them They'll give a free kick yeah, we're both 30 yards out. I'm sure somewhere you'll strike this ziani Well, if england don't win this game tonight If they think there's pressure out there this evening Then that's nothing compared to what they'll have in port elizabeth against slaviniya next wednesday And here's a big moment perhaps for algiria Having been happy to contain for the most part Bugeira particularly can thump the dead balls. He's just not too far away from this ziani is often involved in the set pieces England lining up and now here's a big testing moment for david james His algiria free kick is a long long way away from the england goal david james stands on his line The free kick to be smashed in for algiria straight into the england war and the ball breaks to the far side of the field Where johnson can't get there against the arney who turns around him brilliantly Ziani for algiria johnson made a good recovery and now it's lenin lenin will Be given perhaps 10 or 15 minutes to see what he can do down the right hand side. I agree with allen They really need joe cole. I think his enterprise in the second half as algiria tidy up once more And it's a neat header back to the goalkeeper. Oh boy chris. There's ziani Brilliant change of pace and direction and he's got to beat me then johnson every time he picks it up Just a little shake of the hips Does it really is now the ball is launched forward towards matt moore matt moore doesn't control it first time But now he's going to try and turn with the england defenders and here's a crossing opportunity Ball dragged back onto the england area to matt moore surrounded by white shirts Moments here of danger for england and algiria lose their way and england give the ball back once more to david james in the goal Away to our right. This is five live second half three minutes old england nil algiria nil David james getting impatient here before he makes the clearance james brings the ball forward and now aims it towards Heskey and runi in the algiria half heskey header on looking for runi runi now looking to play it into gerard It was very well defended by buggera at the back there for algiria And now they look to get forward once more lovely touches in midfield at times And then buggera has just hammered it down the center towards matt moore and john terry penalize clumsy challenge by the chelsea captain You know algiria were looking forward and they've got another free kick He's a new sense mat boy he doesn't jump he just gets his body on the lane of the ball and john terry's focused on it And that's two in a row. He's just brought them down now Well, it's a very long way out but with this world cup ball anything's possible. Yedda at the moment is placing it And uh, algiria just in conversation around the ball here It's going to be lasso and i think who might take responsibility It's yedda Or maybe yedda yedda at the moment is marching and perhaps he's going to run in and try and smash this one towards david james Lassen standing over the ball. Maybe he will touch this one off 10 yards. No, england with a wall of five referee wants them back another couple of couple of feet So david james crouches away to our right. We'll try and get everything behind this if it comes his way Yedda perhaps of portsmouth is going to hit this towards his own portsmouth goalkeeper david james Here it comes Yedda's drive all along the ground johnson managed to take all the sting out of it And heskey in the right back position now to try and loop that's only aron lenon up front and that was poor play from melmore heskey Straight back again to the algirians and it's yedda. I mean yedda and belhage who Are tonight looking a million dollars out there for algiria against this? Multi million pound england team ball played into the england penalty area it doesn't trouble david james But james is showing loads of signs of frustration down there with his defenders and england need to be together here Well, they just can't get the ball as simple as that mate. They're not moving it. They're not quick enough They can't pick it up. They can't pick second balls up. They're just stretched out where they're very compact Yes, they're just lucky england so far. Let's be honest that algiria haven't got a cutting edge They have not got a center forward chris. What a terrible ball that was there by gareth barry It just nobody just seems to want to hold the ball here They are showing all the fear that fabio capello talked about when he took over Gripped by anxiety michael karik at the moment doing some stretches down there Fabio capello is back in the technical area looking for an improvement here england concede yet another free kick and they haven't been able to build up any kind of Flow at all at the start of the second half It really is a shapeless performance here lacking conviction and confidence But most important of all here just afflicted too much by By the expectation, I think england nil algirian nil on five live and already six minutes gone in the second half as buggera Thumps the free kick into the england half kariga gets above The striker but that little flick there from ziani map more is there The lenons trying to track back and the ball is out of play down the right and it's going to be An england throne, but they just haven't got going again here and capello will have to make changes soon Injection perhaps from the bench milner Cole karik defoe would all love to come on i'm sure to try and lift this england performance Ball still inside the england half It's been pretty much there for the whole of this second half runes hardly had a touch At the start now he might get it now runes flick to jerry jerry's early ball now for heiske down the right hand side Algeria now trying to get players back heiske takes possession down the england right needs some delivery here emil heiske He's stumbling into the penalty area and then nothing cross comes in from heiske And that really was wretched from heiske england broke well Clever ball to emil heiske the ball just seemed to get tangled up under his feet and there was nothing at the end of it Now just some zingland up i'm afraid to say Just nothing's happening. There's no bodies. You say i think probably steven jerrods The only one who's looked like trying to do anything when he's had the ball apart from that Very lackluster performance by everybody Adject performance and you just wonder also whether gareth barry is going to be able to finish the game here having been out since the First week of may back past the goalkeeper and boy This is barry's first game for some weeks And uh, you just wonder whether he'll have the stamina to be able to see it through So that's perhaps why the likes of miller and karakor warming at johnson called in possession over on the far side But the referee is going to penalize the arty and johnson's gone down under the challenge And england have a free kick. I tell you what's noticeable. I make I know that's how we've got the benefit that we play You can't show your studs, you know that but i just i can't believe the difference in technique We've fainted heart a controller ball and pass it and move and our first touches It the difference in its old teams is amazing But most of these algerian players were schooled in france, weren't they at academies around clefontaine Some of them i know Will coach there and they just look so much more comfortable on the ball Free kick to england nil nil heskey now trying to chill the ball on the chest drops it back into midfield to barry There's no shape here though for england. It's gareth barry now getting the ball away Tired pass there by gareth barry and here come out algeria on the break almost Finding map more england just managed to cut the ball out and ashley coal threads it back once more to gulky for david james What a careless bit of football that was from gareth barry now the clearance from james heskey doesn't even make a challenge It's headed back by algeria and they've got a man yards off side and england have a free kick But there's absolutely no tempo at all here from england. It's a free kicked algeria offside And already nearly nine minutes gone in the second half england will be very fortunate if they go on to win this game Free kick to algeria map more can't control it england Getting themselves into difficulty here. Then there's a foul on ashley coal And they have the free kick But they lack belief here something has to happen to change this for england lampard now of england shuffling forward everybody's running away from him Lampard nobody helping him out barry now manages to sidestep lassan in midfield Gerard back to barry nobody wants to hold the ball here lampard appeals for a handball But they lose their way again in midfield to england And then algeria give the ball away carelessly lampard now to steven gerard gerard pulls it back to an algerian defender And hands go on heads all around us here because that was a good opportunity For england i think chris was saying in the first half that that's the one weakness of this algerian team But sometimes they can give the ball away in dangerous areas england have a corner Now can they settle themselves down in this game here the short corner to lenin of england lenin on the edge of the area Whipson a left footer can't get past the first defender who's bel hage bel hage's clearance to matmore Ashley coal stabs it back and it's out of play over on the far side from algeria throw Well gerard there looking there was three white shirts arrived in the box lampard heskey and ruinie at the far post Just didn't pick one out Just getting a television close up of david beckham and uh Oh beckham would have given this england team a little bit more accurate service. I think had he been over on that right hand side Here come algeria on the halfway line a looping ball to the sneer side of the field ashley coal rising above kadeir Still in play though. It's nil nil here in capetown and only 35 minutes to go Step over's now from budaboo's garraf barry trying to hold him up But budaboo's now feeds matmore once more drives forward on the edge of the area england close him down But yebda picks up the loose ball. They're quicker to the ball each time Algeria now lenin's ball heskey's all on his own down the right hand side players will now try and support him square ball to ruinie Charging forward is lenin ruinie holds it up and played the ball behind steven gerard ashley collo does well to nip in and ashley coal feeds lampard and lamp He didn't want to hold it lampard gives it back to ashley coal ruinie in a tangle in the penalty area doesn't control it Nobody here wants to take responsibility for england. I think that's it here come algeria once more I'll do they're just playing out as I said if i'll do you had a good center for it I'm telling this game would have been over Yebda dangerous ball to the far side the field to the other pompy player bell has you's racing forward glenn johnson Almost got it away from him still danger here nice little flick from xiani england are not clearing the ball and lenin's fell to cut it out Xiani feels bell has you're on the left hand side ashley coal's going to give away a corner here england at sixes and sevens at times and there's just nobody here Assuming the mantle of responsibility you're looking at who you take off to liven it up you can take basically anybody off It's all of you know, it's already saying let's take iron lenin off and let's take We're in runes playing it hard every nesquist playing it hard they all love from lamp on That's all the two it is should pulls out and goes away Never seen runes so ineffective for england so far tonight But he's a gifted enough player to be able to change that In the next half an hour england nil algeria nil but now england and their defenders and remember they don't tend to keep clean sheets Have to face a corner kick lots of green shirts in the england penalty area Corner kick is not back short To xiani xiani will try and whip this ball in to the penalty area england looked a heskey to clear it And now can jerrod run the ball out of defense, but he can't control it and immediately and this is a great tribute to algeria graham taylor paying them a compliment in halftime They hunt the ball back straight away as soon as they've lost it and now a nice change of pace from budaboo's He had to slip to defender on the edge of the area and he's got the free kick It was a dangerous position and a yellow card for kariga. Who's out of the next game? uh budaboo's Wonderful talent little trick. He played at the wrong side of kariga. He struggled to turn He did block him off and the referee was close by and spotted it Matthew Upsham will have to play one assumes now in the next game against slaviniya Kariga's out of the next match his second yellow card in his second game And this is a dangerous free kick again For algeria on the edge of the england penalty area To the left as we look at it david james guards his post who's going to take this ziani maybe and i can't believe he's going to roll it for somebody hit you gotta go direct Whoever's charging will block it. In the modern day football you've got to be brave and you've got to hit it off a dead ball Well, it's ziani at the moment standing over the ball the man who'll be playing If he stays with wilsburg for steve mclaren next season in germany champions league experience And james on his haunches crouches so england Defending this free kick and it's Smashed in and wide in the end and that's not taken a deflection ziani unselfishly fed it And it was lashed well wide of david james in the end and we played 14 minutes of the second half Who was it who struck at the end? Yeah, he had it at the centre half. I don't know why they're rolling the ball What a position he's got there to run up and bend it or strike it with pace. You don't need to roll it Well, algerius preparation spot on tonight for england. They denied them the possession They've worked harder than england none of england's So-called big players have got into the game at all particularly wane rooney and now england have a throw in down this near side And if they win this they are going to be Extremely fortunate ashley coal with the throw in Heskey and rooney in the area. We're reaching the point now where surely fabio capello will think about changes with Just over half an hour to go england throwing ashley coal Seems to be running out of ideas here throws it on to gerrard's back and england lose it straight away John terry tries to play it back lampard will bring it down and send it forward to rooney And rooney can't control it and lampard didn't want to hold it either But somehow at the end of all of that they get a corner kick out of sure no phillips is going to come on And that'll be got to be for lenin Well, let's be honest hasn't had a great game, but you could take anybody off tonight And so still no joe coal At this world cup for england nil algeria nil on five line Stephen gerrard the england captain with an england corner kick White shirts weight in the area in goes the kick goalkeeper fist it and holds on to it in the end In fact, he didn't fist it he juggled with it and then tumbled over and made the catch And the opportunity goes begging and we're into the last half an hour of this game And shawn right phillips who came on of course against the usa In that game is coming on now we'll get a word from graham teller in a moment It's john terry tries to head the ball towards the halfway line There are big spaces though in the midfield for england. They're being outnumbered there. They're being outplayed out there They're being out fought in midfield as well as now Algeria send another good ball to bel haja on the far side bel haja into yedam back again to yedam Algeria just teasing england at the moment as they just pass the ball around Then they play the ball across the field of baguera who lays it off neatly to kadeir Here's danger again now if kadeir can get across in ashley clull closes him down Wonderful football the confidence is team shawn considering this team's coming without winning football matches 3-0 they lost to the republic of Ireland a few weeks ago in one of their warm-up games But they're holding england and in fact doing more than that really here They're completely frustrating england and now it's lenon who'll be coming off soon We think runy now trying to find some space here runy to johnson over on the england right hand side England trying to get bodies forward now Lynn johnson enters the Algerian half runy takes over once more England though with few ideas this evening ashley cull now trying to show a bit more determination good ball to runy doesn't control it though Normally sweeps those in under his control. Algeria. They'll make a mess of the clearance lampard now finding lenon runy's waiting Lenon with a shot in oh he almost dropped to runy It was a powerful cross in the end from lenon which is taking a deflection off the Algerian defender halish and england have a corner far side gareth barry to take it and now The change about to be made by fabio capello. No surprise command coming off is aram lenon I'm coming on to play tonight on the right hand side Remember who played on the left against the usa is Sean right phillips just to repeat jamie karigan now second yellow card Of the tournament will be suspended from the next game england corner Barry to take it left footed over on the far side and it goes and the goalkeeper fumbles Doesn't control it, but there's nobody there to threaten him in a white shirt of england And algeria with a good ball out of defense lovely control again from buda booze And uh smoothly now algeria bill from the back once more And now yedda really bossing midfield good ball into the center circle They're keeping it and they're moving it all the things that england aren't doing in this game Algeria now buggera that's a tidy ball from him as well england can't get the ball away from algeria just at the moment is now it's given away from ziani And we can bring in graham taylor 18 minutes gone on the second half It's not really any any better graham is it there's no different from the first half algeria have out played england To england's advantage really is that what algeria haven't done They haven't had the number of shots that go for all of the possession. They're moving to the ball They've not really hurt england in there in their penalty box and that might yet rescue england But it's the same algeria moving about John terry and james has to come out of his goal And there again you have in a nutshell england's problem here tonight the edginess and the anxiety we talked about lampard Half-harder long ball forward now. Eskia won't get it john terry there. What an earth was he doing? And he really sold david james short and james fortunately from england's point of view Was alive and came out quickly to clear a word from chris wall in the moment And now kariga takes possession again for england. It's just that We can talk about it and technique and movement and looking after the ball and we haven't shown anything tonight We didn't show it a lot in the first game there against america and it's the same old problems Well and longing to hear fabio capello's explanation afterwards On this one he thought they played well against the usa. Well, they've been lamentable so far here tonight And we played over an hour of this game moving towards already the halfway point of the second half england nil algeria nil crowd very quiet for the neutral It's a very poor game so much goodwill in this city for an english football in cape town They must be very disappointed the locals here tonight and now bell hash chases and won't get that over on the far side the field still time for england to Win the game That they're completely lacking Conviction and belief here. Stephen gerrard now sends the ball forward runy. This time doesn't come like i thought he was going to control that But it spins off his ankle once more And algeria looked to go forward until ashley kohl comes in with a sliding challenge And england have a throw in on the halfway down the algerians upset with the decision there by the linesman 20 minutes gone on five live It's england nil algeria nil gareth barry We just wonder how much longer he'll be able to play in this game having been out since the fifth of may barry on the ball Started the game quite smoothly, but he's tiring and laboring a little bit now in this game kariga for johnson Right phillips is looking for his first touch. He's got it now just inside the algeria half Right phillips taking on bell hash right phillips in the end invited the challenge He's still got a chance here spins away from bell hashing is brought down england have a free kick now can they do something positive here? Well sure no phillips fair play well I thought you'd overrun it kept it in and then bellage dives in Earns themselves a free kick in england set pieces and well general play Is not being good, but it's always an opportunity for them. It's a young goalkeeper making his first appearance for algeria He's been put under absolutely no pressure at all Can gareth barry do that now with this free kick for england wide on the right? John terry goes forward and belatedly kariga two It's a terrible kick, but it's not cleared well by algeria lampard now tries to turn and pulls the ball back straight to the Algerian defender a yahir And england lose their way once more throw into algeria over on the far side Do you know what it looks like? Mate, you know the look is if I don't know if they're over train or they do something They just all look so heavy legged with it's a confidence thing and I always talk about it It is a massive fact and especially when you play for england, but a lot of players lack in confidence And I think that's why they're looking tired. It's the tension and it's the anxiety. I think more than anything else Underlined in so many of the performances here tonight such substandard by players who Won't we do so worth their clubs now the chase is on and kariga's looking for david james to help him out and james didn't Come and help him out and then the encarger had to hoof it to safety down this near side of the field Well, he needs to come a little bit earlier doesn't he David james? Just you marked all over the field here England nil algeria nil will be going to allen green in a moment It's budaboo's now tries to trick his way around hezky. Hezky manages to tidy up budaboo's goes back in again And the referee didn't like the challenge So the halfway point three quarters of the way through this game england putting themselves under enormous pressure in this group. It's england nil algeria nil and here is allen green I just shuttered to think what you'll be saying on six-who-six oh five hundred nine nine six nine three remember Be careful with your language Because frankly, I know what I'm thinking about this performance and I certainly can't say it Gerard coming forward over around the ball and the through it goes to imboy you feeble Absolutely feeble every single one of them. I can't think of any england player that you can excuse at the moment Imboy the goalkeeper who plays in the vulgarian league Lashe's at upfield and it goes straight through to david james james taps it out to karigar who'll be missing And one of the circumstances he'll miss a Slovenian match suspended and the way things stand england will have to beat Slovenia to qualify on five points from arguably the easiest group in the world cup Here's gerard in now to barry Barry's leggy throughout frankly, but that's a good pass forward to runny runny's past that gerard was awful I've never seen runny worse playing for england never and i'm sorry. I don't mean to pick on him It's just he's such an outstanding talent. We expect so much more It's with buggera buggera to hallish. You know what they're doing, don't it? They're technically excellent allen. You know the difference We've talked about millions of differences. You know you by the way, but the main thing is They all know where each other is and it's one touch two touch little trick little this They just everybody know they're on the same wavelength where england are just so disjointed to give the ball away They don't know the plain blame passes. They don't know where they're going at times And that's for me whether it's team shape working on it or confidence is the main thing And I don't think many players have got it batmour falls over on the far side of the field And that's fortunate enough for england. He thinks he was fouled, but it's a goal kick to england 21 minutes left Of this pretty abysmal game. Actually, I think karagher fouled him Karagher remember already booked in the game He's shonrite phillips. He's got johnson white to his right johnson mctenneards over the halfway line This is five live in the bbc england abysmal england nil algeri nil but gerard puts haski through Haski shonrout's weak glutes in the air off an offender behind for a corner I did had no conviction whatsoever that haski could finish it I think you try to cross it. He should have hit it hard and low and let the goalie save it He's going to save it. He's trying to pull it back look for a rune running into the far post Barry to take the corner for england 20 minutes left for play Will not forget how bad a game this is But if england can only sneak a win Barry deep cross gerard with a head straight in the goalkeeper for a long range terrible mark in by algeria fell asleep good movement good header by gerard nobody in front of the goalkeeper He gets him one in front of the goal. He's a little a little touching to go But again the goalkeeper holds the ball well bell hatch to lasen lasen put his defender Under fresher, but he clears it up field to map more map more tackled by barry ball bricks at johnson back to karagher And now terry terry to the far side and johnson And johnson's a little bit of room and he finally moves into the opposition half finds gerard into lampire How poor frank lampire being as well? gerard You can say that the ball of the local jav that's a better run forward jav approaching the fennel chair that his cross was poor At algeria get the ball off the england captain and it's cleared to the far side to bell hatch bell hatch into bit of ooze They look so much more Technically efficient than england. This is a shameful thing to say Here's ziani ziani now Up into map more map more with plenty of room there england defenders around him are not close enough to him plays the ball to the left towards bell hatch bell hatch Back to lasen lasen sweeps across in diving header clear by karagher his husky Uh to lampire lampire lisa for johnson And um, I think michael's getting quite upset about this england performance Anyway, it's head outfield and algeria had the ball back It doesn't get any better does it chris? abduan a midfield throw will be coming on shortly And defoe as well well Many people thought defoe was going to start this game instead of husky Well, he would he got any service? But it's uh, it's been a very very very poor performance Against a team who's come at this tournament with the worst record in the friendly Well, it seems almost inconceivable to think it but you know rooney Rooney could easily be substituted. He's been that poor Here's jerrod on the halfway line To barry or left it for barry barry thought jerry was going to take it up again 18 minutes to go Shocking game here in capetown. What a shame so much goodwill towards england in this city south fringens proving that For them england aren't far short of bifana bifana Here's rooney shooting from long range wide of gold Goal kick nothing happening. It's all here is defoe Well, I suppose it's got to be for husky No, it's not it's lemon Husky are not like what am I talking about? I think they could put the wrong number up, you know They put seven up What's happening? They got the algerian sub first right so abdoin for budaboo's What can be that took him off? No, I think he's been playing well excellent and defoe for husky Well, they can't get any worse Can't get any worse 17 minutes to go It's hit towards germain defoe but beyond him and the goalkeeper prevented going behind for a goal kick Has he been put on already any pressure at all? Fourth choice that marseille was used to be Now with slavius appear The long clearance from the algerian goalkeeper and matmure a judge to have Maybe handle the ball. It's a free kick to england Imagine coming, you know halfway across the world world to watch this, you know and it as an england fan It's blind loyalty england nil algerian nil on five line the lines open for 606 0 590 96 93 mind your language Here's barry Very to gerard lampard gerard onto defoe defo into the penalty No conviction though defenders got across it's put behind for a corner. Oh, that was a lot But I wasn't a few one two was a little bit of movement a bit of place about the attack What's uh defoe a great saving tackle yet again how many times we talked about this algerian defense The corner that we've taken by steven gerard on the far side of the field Terry is in the penalty a terrible corner Didn't beat the first defender awful a bit like that Free kick by barry about five minutes ago Here's ashley coal after the algerian clearance to lampard and our terry rather look how Firmly terry hit the pass back towards karagher technique again poor ashley coal for england On to barry in the halfway line. He tried to feed it towards the left hand side Didn't find shawn right phillips who's uh switch from right to left Here's lampard though to gerard gerard on toward defoe defo chase is after really into the penalty Here the cross was early hit the defender behind for a corner That was a decent run but the ball by gerard. Yes, nice runny spot. I did put he's gone away from the goal And that's all he could do. He tried to hook it in and have worked themselves yet another corner So we've had a wretched free kick from barry a wretched corner by gerard and now lampard is going to take this corner Get it right Hit high looking for terry terry heads it down barry with a shot hits the defender appears for handball can't have been a penalty Can't have been no chance of that and the referee rightly ignores it I think it's alish who's come out and closed it. I didn't know anything about it. He turned on the half It's just bounced up. He's turned. He's it's just hit him 14 minutes left for play england corner That almost left over the edge of the algerian penalty here throw goes to terry now taken up by gerard Oh Right Phillips never even looked as he flicked the ball and he shrugged off by abduing the substitute for algeria matmore hits it away towards the far side towards bell hage bell hage Scampers forward towards the england penalty. It's the anne's return pass for by for gokey Well, bell hage wanted it. He played the one two and that is it only for me. Did the right ball bell had pulled up? I don't know why but uh, they've still got that threat on the counter attack, haven't they but They've dropped a little bit deep anne's got a little bit more time on the ball A reminder of the point situation in the group If this finishes level at nil nil Slovenia will be top on four points The usa and england will both have two points in algeria will have one point england would qualify in that scenario if they beat slovenia Huh with this form who knows? Johnson crosses in and uh default tried to dive forward ahead Is a defender headed away and it's another corner to england and they're filling up just a little bit of steam here Well, I would say algea have just come off the pace lately They're dropping a little bit deeper they're letting it come up to the box and putting i'm not saying they're putting good crosses in But no that's what five corners 12 minutes to go lampards corner Too deep Headed away jolson heads into barry barry chipson in the penalty here headed up by baguera Johnson still there might break the rune Doesn't break the rune defo though clicks it in the direction of gerard overhead behind for a goal kick It just it looks like they've never worked on a set piece A general play they just don't seem to be on the same wavelength Well graham has continually made the point grand taylor You know that he just understand another why this business of naming the team two hours before kickoff How do you prepare your team? How do you prepare your starting 11 that you presumably decided on sometime earlier for a game when the players don't even know it? Don't understand it here baguera Inside the final dozen minutes Algeria have been the better team throughout the game abdu in the substitute and towards mattenmore half cleared by carragher flags up for offside against abdu Yeah, he's give off side But again, they still have that threat. It's certainly you've got you can't fault. I do that. This is probably You know if you say the manager can you play any better? He's gonna say no Would love a bit more quality in the box alone in the final third, but as for a football team They've played very very well Grand taylor 10 yards away to where I left Still anxious Yeah, still anxious England have come a little bit more into it. I think as much by probably Algeria tiring that little bit And there's no doubt about it that I wouldn't say this is their best spell because you can't hardly use the word best But I think they're just beginning to come into the game And we'll just have to see right at the death if they would win it It would be somewhat unfairly if they do but let's hope that's the case Well, certainly Even if England do win the game Well dare anybody name England is a potential world cup winners on this display the ball played Towards Jared but over hit again the pass and it's behind for a goal kick. Well, why isn't actually Cole on? Ashley Cole he's playing. I'm not actually cold. Sorry the other cold Joe Well, obviously Capello doesn't fancy him simple as that He's warming up down behind the goal with a couple other players milner and Peter Crouch, which I think they've got a look at somebody's going down. It's a ziani. I think he's got cramp Uh, ziani might be coming off. Yeah, he's got cramp because um Guadura The number 17 is coming on. Uh, yeah, it is the any who's gonna going to leave Uh, how many minutes to go 10 minutes to go? Certainly, I don't think there's been a worse world cup game here in South Africa than this one or am I being too harsh? No, I think you're being very fair I've got to say I've enjoyed watching the I'll do your play but they haven't got a cutting edge in the box But the way they play nice on the eye Just amazing me. You know, it's like was down and I keep said probably every world cup would keep saying the same thing technically We just struggled with the ball at the feet Unbelievable Still no no England and Algeria I'm sure as the ante didn't want to come off. But if he's got cramp Really has to And he's sorry just not quite as comfortable over the last few minutes as they've been for most of the game Johnson fair challenge according to the referee close five right Phillip takes it forward But I never looked likely to beat bell haj Algeria have the ball. It's back with uh, you hear the captain You hear switches it towards the right side accurately played Caddy here On to abduin abduin tries to back heal the ball hits Ashley Cole Moves in the direction of runy and really now gets a second chance as jared finds him and then runy loses the ball It is I think without question the worst I've ever seen when runy play for England Nail nail eight minutes left for play 0 500 909 69 3 is the number to call if you want to take part in 606 And please just be careful what you say language wise There's a file now and Sean right Phillips Free kick to England is the result just ahead of the center circle slightly to the right Right Phillips takes it to Johnson on the far side of the field Can this England display be redeemed not with a cross like that While the overhead by Glenn Johnson behind for a goal kick I'm sure the ball will be mentioned after But uh funny how I I'll see if they kick it right yeah, they do You know playing it accurately to one another goodness gracious Goal kick taken now by him boy Less than eight minutes to go cherry hits it back. Here's jared jared finds lampard lampard dinks it in the direction of Johnson Johnson on to right Phillips in the far side of the field defos a head of right Phillips was never looking on field Place it back to Glenn Johnson It's almost at walking pace as Johnson moves Across the halfway line Peter Kroger is going to come on last resort now Here's Barry to lampard lampard to right Phillips and on to the far side the England right and Johnson Into lampard you're outside the penalty area lampard almost tripped in the ball Feature to the right side to Johnson Johnson easily loses it far too easily loses it. He's at a poor game They've all had a poor game. He's in and there's a chance that the ball was played in the left side towards bellhage But it never reached them because right Phillips managed to block that pass up field and it started play for throw Well, he was in Glenn Johnson just let him run if you played the ball early and properly he was away There's crouch for heskey. No, heskey's already gone. It's for Gareth Barry for Barry To Gerald goes sent a mid way and runy left wing It's hardly been worth a place in the team runy in this display I think Mike's ready to throw himself off the country now He's having a terrible time Michael taking this performance in And I'm not sure how much he's looking forward to talking to Fabio Capella I'll certainly be fascinated to hear what Capella says about this and he comes over the same sort of dribble as he did after the US game And he said he thought we played well. I think he will wow come off. What will laugh at him? Well, when does he ever not say when does he ever criticize never? Well, I'm sorry, but that'll be able to laugh for me thinks that this England display has been other than pathetic England 0 Algeria 0 6 minutes to go here in Cape Town We've hardly had a chance worthy of the name Well, they are me for all all juries Good play. They have created it. No, no, no, no They tell you what though. I'll have they come and said when they went the World Cup What was their object? What was their object if they say we're drawing and we do that to that qualifies them And that was their game plan and they've had this set out for weeks Default to right Phillips over the half way line mind in the center circle brought down That's certainly a free kick might well be a yellow card. Yep. It is to Lassen. Yep So they didn't need no Bellagio just took it off. We do all by running right Phillips A reminder of the number for 606 0 590 9 6 9 3 and we take the free kick too quickly Now they take it to the referee satisfaction Lampard onto Johnson down the right side into right Phillips right Phillips spins beats the defender does he tries to get the cross in Partially blocked behind for a corner. That's big corner number six from that right hand side. I've got a lot of joy getting down out of here Yeah, but no good deliveries Five minutes to go on five line Nell L in Cape Town Wretched game Quarter for England lampart from the right inch was the near post to foe went to meet it and I think Arguably that came off the defender in the end. They come off the foes back Yeah, he has still stayed down. Maybe he's a clashed heads We'll see. There was a long Gerrard. There was a file on Gerard That certainly wasn't spotted but anywhere to go kick. What do we know about it? Come off the foes back You know, I'm gonna struggle to think of anything good to say about England tonight Nothing they were they were far better playing against the US than this And I you know, I'll do you have played well but Their lower category opposition. Let's face it in terms of world football So you want the technique is far superior England's Bell had running down the left flank Carragher gets there plays it back to James and James Bell said over the halfway line towards Crouch the latest England substitute good header down by Crouch Rooney should have made that his indent beaten by Yebda Now it's with Cadir Cadir in towards mutt more cadir again uh To Yebda and now to the right side the playing well again, Algeria shot driven in from long range hits the back side of Gerard Rebounded a foe who loses it and then it's won by lampart who gives it away Lamentable display by England Three and a half minutes ago another shot by Algeria beaten away by the England defense Rooney was being followed Rooney keeps his feet Good advantage played by the referee then Rooney's pass was wildly over adventurous towards right Phillips And it's back in the possession of Algeria with matlow To bell hatch in the far side into the lesson over the halfway line left to the center circle and plays it back To Halleesh Halleesh towards this near side and Cadir Cadir tackled by Ashley Cole called it well winning the ball Rooney leaves it for Gerard Gerard now to lampart inside the center circle onto Johnson They're still trying to redeem this not the poverty of the display But getting the three points not with a shot like that from 35 yards by lampart well white Well, I think everything will be coming up on your phone in allen. I'm sure that listen the boos listen the boos And who would blame them? But yeah, they've got a fair point But uh, you know when it boils down to it, I'll still sign now and I said at any day I think it's every world cup now. We are very inferior on technique and that's simple. It's short tonight again We've got a little over two minutes to go plus out of time another change for Algeria Um, I can see it's the number 20 coming on for the number 19 Yevda being replaced by mesba a defender And uh, well, they're just tiny things up. They're taking the point now aren't they? This is a game point. But actually they've been worthy of all three. They'll be they'll believe they can beat the usa And that may get them through Oh Well, let's hope they do beat the usa well, we'll see the way things are They love the big center forward back But England will have to beat Slovenia Now they should be able to beat Slovenia, but they should have been able to beat Algeria And America we're not taking we're not taking anything for granted now because England just haven't performed at this world cup at all a minute and a half To go England ill Algeria nil on five lie the Rune's pulling the Algerian player to his feet Unconvinced by the injury to matmore And he thinks that was just wasting time I did be Beckham showing a lot of frustration there and you know, I've always been a big critic of Beckham I'll tell you what some decent delivery from the flanks wouldn't have gone a miss tonight Beckham would have done that bell hage To take the free kick as we enter the last window of the game flick did take the old game didn't really come He caught the ball, but he was under pressure Under serious pressure there's that baguero has gone down injured James belt the ball out of place so that but baguero can receive treatment So that was a good delivery by bell hage wasn't it a lot of bodies in there give day with james credit He kept his eyes on it took it at his waist chest high But a lot of bodies flying around in front of him well done I think baguero is all right But I get the feeling number of players have gone down for Algeria and recent minutes suggest that you know Take the point what he expects. No played well That paper would be saying heroes. What lowers me saying zero so, you know They'll be delighted with this performance. I'll do it Throwing to Algeria in the far side of the field worth the fourth official The the board when he holds it up and tells us how much time will be added on for that It will be very critical for england. No, he hasn't lifted the board yet. He's moving to the touch line now play resumes Punching the number mate and tell us what it is. We're into added time as it is Three minutes of added time being played england ill Algeria nil on apology of a game certainly in terms of this england display look at that from johnson Hi, kerlis was that giving the ball away to matmore Matmore running forward ran into jimmy kariger kariger finds gerard good chest had passed by gerard to default He almost fell over finds gerard gerard forward to lampart lampart breaking couldn't find the pass to runny and then the shot hurried hurried and over the crossbar Well, we've been unjust as let's be honest. We'd love to see that went in We'd love it to go in but let's be honest Algeria being a better side I don't think I don't think england even deserve the point So a win would be daylight robbery england nil algeria nil two minutes of added time remaining goalkeepers gold kick headed away by kariger to the far side of the field and still in play for algeria with mesba mesba holding off johnson and then a poor pass by mesba Here's krauts in the far side beats one defender beat two defenders. Well done peter kraut and then having done that He pulls it back to algeria when he got three colleagues in field He did never so well a dribble two don't not lay there's a block off. That's a free kick. No, he's give it not not give it Yes, he has a referee lanes. We never flogged. Yep free kick against glenn johnson We we have said in the past johnson is not a good defender for a full back Hasn't he been exposed tonight? Free kick to algeria one minute of added time remaining here in cake time england nil algeria nil those lines for 606 will be buzzing 0 500 90 96 93 I'll be presenting the program in about 12 minutes time It's out of play in this new side of the field runy made up an aggressive challenge to say the least Didn't like the reaction of the algerian player didn't like the reaction of the lineman The algerian player still rolling around here For dear he has to get up. Come on. It wasn't that bad. Oh, he's running the club. But he had to say It's in their benefit for him to get up the clocks running down They'd take the point of release having to go at the was back of star referee on call for he's been good as he was in the opening game As the referees have been generally here at the world cup Last chance not the ones today last chance though For algeria bell had left footed far too deep for that free kick up over the crossbar And we've had a lot or we should have where the goal kick is taken away The referee will blow his whistle very soon There we go johnson picks it up field one last opportunity headed away by algeria Picked up by jerrod. Gerrod's pass was overhead towards actually cold colds unbending well to win a corner There is a chance for england one final attempt A corner to be taken from the left side Gerrod's gonna take it. Well, Gerrod's gotta get in there quick. He's not even looking they're not marking The fellow sleeper bit algeria terry and crutch wait playing deep looking for crutch well defended by algeria Headed away final whistle goes and england get What they deserve a point A joke they deserve nothing. It was no no I've got to say all the praise of gold algeria. Yes, I haven't created a lot but football wise It seems they embarrassed us the way they could keep the ball technical ability was superb And there you've got to say that that england was a dreadful performance Boy am I looking forward to 606 not no no
