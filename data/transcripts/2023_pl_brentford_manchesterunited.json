  "transcript": " And proving that not everything that 74 years old has to be removed from sports report. Here's John Murray Very good very good. Well, I'm pleased to hear we've kept ourselves sense of humor anyway And there is the whistle for the start of Brentford against Manchester United in the Premier League in the sunshine Here in Brentford's community stadium the GTEC community stadium as it is now And we are we are absolutely Swell-tied and when I say we I mean Glenn Murray who's sitting next to me Premier League goal scorer with Crystal Palace and Bournemouth and Brighton and this has the feel Glenn of a very big game Yes, especially for one side and that's eyes Manchester United Brentford have got a free hit here at a huge club And I'm sure inside that Brentford dressing room They will fancy their chances this afternoon as we see Manchester United being patient with their build-up Yes, they're playing from right to left in the first half and Brentford now just clearing the ball away Red and white striped shirts for the bees black shorts red and white socks Ben me just heading the ball forward near the edge of his own penalty area and Brentford then going all the way back to Goalkeeper David Ryder. They've made two changes Thomas Frank their manager from the the opening match the 2-2 draw Against Leicester last weekend the comeback match more on that in a moment Rashford now playing the ball through the middle to Christiano Ronaldo who goes down Henry in with a challenge just outside the penalty area It was in the D by the time that he fell referee Stuart at well immediately says nothing doing No free kick on the edge of the box booze from the home supporters for Christiano Ronaldo for the way that he went down Glenn Yes, I have to agree with Stuart out. Well, he's gone down in installments there John The bar has been set a lot higher this season as we've seen from the referees and that is not gonna warrant a free kick This season however a moment of alarm for Brentford and Rashford providing the ball through So Brentford with Ryder in goal three central defenders then as United played the ball over the top But that's headed away on the edge of the box by Pontus Jansen and United go back to the halfway line So the three central defenders Roos left coming into the team Jansen and me Hickey on the right Henry on the left and then in the middle no garden Jensen Josh De Silva Brian and Burma and Ivan Tony up front and Manchester United just the one change and that is Christiano Ronaldo coming in to start For the first time this season now fully fit was able to play only a minimal part in United's preseason So he's in Scott McTominay is on the bench So to here in goal a back four of Daloh, Maguire, Martinez and Shaw there was speculation that there would be a change at the back But not so in midfield Fred Bruno Fernandez and Christian Ericsson back here at the club Where he made his comeback last season there were some booze It was a mixed reception when his name was read out pre-match and Sanchez and Rashford in the wider positions and Ronaldo through the middle So this United attack comes to an end on Brentford in Brentford's left back position and it is a free kick that Ben me will take so Here we are live Premier League football in the unlikely event you've not heard the Saturday 5 30 Premier League kickoff is a Commentary match now on five live and BBC sounds for the foreseeable future for the the next three years at least And this is being played In a terrific atmosphere swirling around the stadium even though the capacity here is less than 20,000 big shots for Ivan Tony who went down under the challenge But no free kick and United moving it through the middle Bruno Fernandez Christiano Ronaldo tries to shop from Way way out on the right-hand side, but it bounces in front of Ryan who's able to fall forward and grab it into his chest Yes, Ryan collected that very well because the way that Christiano Ronaldo struck that ball It was wicked it bounced about three four foot just in front of the goalkeeper and skipped up off the turf But his hands were nice and clean brilliant start by Manchester United There's a lot of anticipation around the Brentford stadium tonight that they would come and they would get a result But Manchester United have come out and started this game fantastically well ball forward For Burma to to make the run across the back line. It was Ivan Tony That's going to be a feature today Glenn to see how Uncomfortable Ivan Tony makes this from a choir and Martinez. Yes, that's funny You've mentioned that so early John because that's the first thing at the top of my notes Martinez and Tony battle. I know that Brentford and Ivan Tony will have watched last week's game the Manchester United versus Brighton game and that is a big talking point Martinez his height Will be pulling on to me and he will be asking questions all afternoon Yeah, it you know, I'd heard that he wasn't the tallest and you can never really tell it until you see someone in the flesh But it is really quite striking when you see him on the field there He's he's way short of six feet to throw them one of Brentford's long throws into the penalty area. It's rattling around inside the United Box, it's still in play and then with No guard the closest arriving to it Was stabbed behind by combination of Ericsson and Martinez it's a corner to Brentford Yes, it was classic pinball in the middle of the box then he just wouldn't sit kindly enough for a Brentford player And it is Ericsson your right He just comes across and stabs it out of play for a Brentford corner. It was the long throw from Matthias Jensen Takes me back to the first match here of last season when Brentford made their return to the Premier League and an unsettled Arsenal with the long throws but it's a corner now from the right and Bermont and Jensen are there It looks as though it's going to be in Bermont. It is left footed to the near post that's headed away It was Cristiano Ronaldo Henry arrives on it But he snatched at the shot though defenders arriving and he hit it wildly actually and it hit the Advertising hoardings halfway up the stand to our right. Yes I think he saw his his naming light as he approached that ball then he just lost his composure And it goes high into the stand behind the goal So it's five live BBC sounds Brentford Nail Manchester United Nail there'll be more reaction interviews and And a full roundup again on all of the significant events this afternoon up and down the country not just in the footballing world but in the sporting world as well and Mention of that reminds me to To tell you that you can listen to commentary on the hundred right now on sports extra Live from Cardiff, but it is a throwing for Manchester United sure Takes the throw he gets it back from Ronaldo long long high left footed ball looking for Jaden Sancho Manchester United in this This change kid of to sort of yellowy Yellowy grits feels like it's got a green tinge to it as well Fernandez playing the ball out towards the right-hand side Sanchez is there Cristian Ericsson. Well, there are the booze Cristian Ericsson that's Paul from the Brentford fans. I feel yeah, well here. He is again made his comeback here Brentford Thomas Frank brought him here. This is obviously after the The incident when he collapsed at the euros in Copenhagen as Luke Shaw is impeded for a high foot And it's a free kick to Brentford the challenge on Aaron Hickey the right wing back as he is in this match so far And it's a free kick to Brentford point being I think some of the Brentford supporters Felt that You know, they would have liked to have seen him repay the faith that he had in them But you know, I think the other side of that is for Cristian Ericsson with everything that's happened to him The fact that he's 30 years old now gets the chance to go to Manchester United on a three-year contract Yes, it's a huge opportunity. It's very naive of the supporters to boo him I think they should be appreciative that they've seen him play for the club and do so well because I think it was a huge plus in keeping them Open that link with Tony that they created at the end of last season. So for them to boo him I think it's really poor Foul on Hickey from Ronaldo Who looks less than impressed that just down in front of us here Hickey went down just a tub by Ronaldo Purse lips from him and he walks past referee at well, and it's a free kick I'm just chuckling because Just as kickoff was approaching the Sun came around the side of the stand. So it is now blazing on us We are really struggling to see this TV that's in front of us. So didn't have a chance to see How how serious that challenge was by Ronaldo or otherwise other than by the naked eye So it's a free kick anyway down in front of us that Manchester United are holding an extremely high line eight and nine yards outside their penalty area and it's played square by Jensen then No guard lifted over the top good intention He was looking for the run of them Burma, but no guard Just overheated and it bounced harmlessly through from Manchester United goal kick and it's Brentford Neil Manchester United Neil And this is Glenn Murray That little triangle there that was straight from the training ground wasn't it? He did everyone was a square ball out to no guard who tried to find when Buehmoy He just made a run behind the Manchester United defense, but The pass just was a little bit overheated wasn't it? Glenn Manchester United are trying to play up from the back again Ball ends up with McGuire and And they were all over him Brentford And he was he was able to win a throw in by deflecting it off the Brentford player Cristiano Ronaldo goes down Brentford come forward now a low shot It's gone in oh my goodness Josh De Silva from 20 yards, but De here should have saved it Routine saved down to his left is squirmed through his hands into the bottom corner That is a nightmare again for Manchester United again for David here And after his opening defeat in his first Premier League match at Old Trafford Eric Tenhard sees his team go one nil down here after ten minutes with a goal like that Brentford one Manchester United Neil and that's two in two for Josh De Silva Hence my reaction as it slipped in through De Hayes hands or no slipped out of my mouth I couldn't believe it looked like it saved the ball already He had both pounds behind it But it just slipped off and rolled into the back of the net for her horrendous error from the Spanish goalkeeper the Manchester United number one as I see Fred just go over to him and give him a Little bit of a cuddle a little bit of a pep talk The one thing that you've got to take from this right now from a Manchester United perspective is there's time to get back In this game but as far as Brentford are concerned. What a fantastic start to the game Well, you know, it might be a new start It might be a new story as Eric Tenhard said in these Program notes at Old Trafford last weekend, but it really feels like we've seen all this before But look sure is carrying the ball up towards the edge of the penalty area and now Fernandez arriving on the edge of the box hits a shot high over the top But Cristiano Ronaldo went down early and they in that move. I don't know whether he was caught after the ball had gone Well He went down, but now he's back up on his feet. It looked for a moment just thought You know, he was in some serious pain there, but he has got back to his feet quite quickly I thought for a moment it really hurt himself because it was theatrical, but he's open He's absolutely fine, but there's Manchester United their best one twos Luke Shaw going right through the heart of the Brentford defense and gets laid back to Fernandez very similar to an opportunity had against Brighton at Old Trafford last week and again Miss miss times the shot and put it over the bar, but Bruno Fernandez will be disappointed with that flowing move for United though Fernandez to Sancho on the right hand side, but his low crosses blocked Brentford were quickly back in there in numbers You have to give them credit in this sweltering heat Very early stages still deep cross to the back post Hickey gets under it Rashford It was thinking about allowing it to bounce out of play, but he's kept it in kept possession Rashford now back centrally to Martinez and then to the left-hand side to Shaw, but Manchester United still shaken by the way that they've conceded that opening goal David to here hanging his head. I mean He goes from the brilliant to Moments like that that happened to him on a on a two-frequent basis really. Yeah, I mean As far as Eric ten hugs concern I mean he is one player that you think you can rely on and he's He's an elder statement at the scope I'm just looking John as we both sat in here sat here in our caps watching this game and the Sun is directly in David Hey, is eyes and I wonder why he hasn't got a cap on and if that had a point to play in the goal Popside flag against Marcus Rashford, so it's a free kick to Brentford But but I mean it was it was quite a low shot But I see what you're saying whether there was a moment of being dazzled in the midst of that I mean, it's directly in front in the Sun and it's in it's beating down on him and I just wonder Why not have a hat on just for that extra bit of security, you know, I think that's a great point So David to here and he diving down to his left as I said at the time Looked like a routine save just to silver on his right foot round about 20 yards out Hit it well enough The scrambling down his left just slipped through his hands and into the bottom corner It was almost as if he felt as though he'd already made the save and that he was moving on to the next action And was looking where he was going to pass the ball next But you know what I mean, it feels like in it's the same old problems You know, if it's not one thing with Manchester United, it's another But taking that one error and you can't you can I mean it's an individual error that you can't No thing for me. Yeah, it's just one of those Manchester United start of this game has been very good They look much better than last week agreed Here is De Silva Brentford's goal scorer two goals in two matches great story Low cross into the penalty area cleared away by Martinez with his right foot just to silver who had these These injury problems the hip injury and here now in Burma Hitting a shot but straight into McGuire on the edge of the box and then Martin as is able to head it away Comes out to Jensen turns the full 360 degrees gives it to Hickey Now the ball to the right-hand side to silver in the box on the left plays it across. It's half cleared But then a foul by no guard on the edge of the area and a free kick to Manchester United But yes, you're right Glenn, you know, we've seen some flowing moves from Manchester United Already in the match not 15 minutes play Unfortunately the damning fact is they're one nil down I mean even though Brentford are leading this game one no with 14 minutes into the game And that's the first bit of possession they've had anywhere neither Manchester United 18 year box and justice elbow was he was the main part of it again playing it across and Look if much tonight they managed to get rid of it But that's the best little pattern of play Brent Nevaad Brentford have had so far Brentford won Manchester United nil that is the The score line here a goalkeeping error by David Dehaer Josh the silver shot slipping into the bottom corner and you can hear the crowd getting on it to here as the ball is passed back to him So so last weekend last Sunday you might have heard it on five live in Eric Tenhards first Premier League match They lose to Brentford for the first time and now they failed to clear and then Harry McGuire puts the challenge in in the D It's a free kick and it's a yellow card Well, there's a moment there. I did wonder whether there might have been a case for a red I think Quite correctly the point was made that the ball was running across the penalty area I think that might have saved McGuire there yellow card for the Manchester United captain Yes, there was a recovering defender that can't quite make out who it was on the screen But for me it's a bad pass from the wise to begin with it gives it to Ericsson who's under a lot of pressure Tries to play the ball round the corner facing his own goal that gets cut out and all of a sudden Brentford are on the attack And it leads to Harry McGuire having to make a last-ditch challenge. It's bad play by Manchester United Dennis Brentford. I mean this is a free kick in the D slightly left of centre near the middle of the D The Brentford can get a second goal now in this match I'd be very interested to see how these Manchester United players reacted to that absolutely And Bermol standing to the right of the ball and the Manchester United wall that yellowy-green wall Three four five Manchester United players in there a couple of Brentford players as well and The free kick is ready to be taken They've got a man lying down behind the wall as well. It's hit up and over the top of the crossbar harmlessly away That wasn't very far away It's just got open over the wall He couldn't quite get the dip on it and he goes over the uncovered side of the goal But if I was Thomas Frank the one message I would have been getting on to the field of play there will be Hit it on target ask questions of David Dehaia especially after just what happened. Yeah, Jensen with the free kick Oh Jensen's run the ball back in the area shoots low Christian Ericsson was caught in possession inside his own penalty area He presented it to Matias Jensen and his fellow Dain said thank you very much And with his right foot buried it into the empty net and Brentford celebrate a second goal and Manchester United's players are looking Gag as a one another well, it's happening again Eric Tenhardt stands down on the touchline and again last week in the first half his team were 2-0 down to Brighton This week the 2-0 down to Brentford And he stands on the edge of the pitch there and I can just see the slight shake of their head and the wave of the arm He is not very happy But Manchester United are causing their own problems again only one minute ago We said about McGuire giving the ball to Ericsson in playing a blind pass around the corner He does it again Ericsson's always gonna show for the ball to give an option But the passes and on the players need to realize that he gives it away in his own 80 yard books and Jensen Capitalizes rules it in to the bottom right hand corner of Dehaia's net Manchester United causing their own problems again in this game not 20 minutes played Brentford to Manchester United nil Extraordinary really what a start for Eric Tenhardt The last Manchester United manager to lose his first two competitive matches was John Chapman in 1921 and Manchester United finished bottom and were relegated that season he has some Burma taking the ball away But he ran it out of play after the challenge didn't he man he beat the I thought it was just over played did you think not that was very very tight from where we sat John? I think I think that's very beneficial for the Defensive side of Manchester United that a Burma was away if that call wasn't made I would like to see a replay well the assistant ruled it That it had crossed the line. It was touching girl remains to nil But I mean so can you tell me why that wasn't ran on and look back at VA afterwards? I think they did I think they'd oh because that's not and you can't look at that. That's one of those incidents one of the key one of the key four areas that you That that wasn't one of them ball out on the touch line Here come Manchester United on the on the right hand side and now they've got to come from two nil down And even though there were promising early signs Cristiano Ronaldo now hits a shot on the edge of the penalty area But it flies up and away over the top by three or four yards never threatened David Ryers goal But I mean honestly clan I almost can't believe what I'm saying here after last week To see what what Brighton did so well we should say against Manchester United But to implode like this those two goals at this level aha Acceptable. Yeah, you're right. It is unacceptable, but the crazy thing is coming into the game today I really did believe Brentford could get something out of this game I didn't think the future me look so early on in the game, but They've caused their own problems Manchester United apart from those two mistakes. They've played quite well I mean it sounds crazy, but Rashford's been quite bright That sounds a little bit like the old Abraham Lincoln doesn't it when he was assassinated and the Theater and they said but apart from everything else Mrs. Lincoln. How did you enjoy the play? Throw in Shaw Takes it Ronaldo inside his own half There is space on the far side and Ronaldo finds it and Dallow is able to stretch his legs open his legs move into Brentford territory But if you've just switched onto a certain five live if you've been at a match Manchester United are two nil down Shaw now crossing from the left-hand side Henry gets up to head that away comes out for United again and now Well, the ball is played low across the penalty area But Brentford are able to block that and clear it up towards the halfway line and you can hear the reaction Harry McGuire when he's on the ball He's already had uncertain moments in this match United coming again on the right-hand side with Sancho and then Dallow and Back it goes now to Bruno Fernandez in a more deep-lying position. He turns plays it square and then Lissandro Martinez the Argentine the the number six for Manchester United turns it to the captain Harry McGuire United dominating possession now inside the Brighton inside the Brentford half He has Fred Fred's pass with the diagonal to Bruno Fernandez Brentford have got everyone back behind the ball Yeah, it's Brentford are just happy sitting in their shape and shuffling and allowing Manchester United to break them down there Just saying come on have a goal to see what you can do see if you can play between the lines But so far Manchester United just passing around the outside of this Brentford ship. Yep, Erickson again being booed Even though he was thought he was the man dispossessed for the second Brentford goal when Matthias Jensen Pick pocketed him inside the penalty area And then there's an overhead pass from out on the right-hand side Which I don't think will bounce out of play Rashford is trying to shield it The Hickey does well and allows the ball to bounce out of play for a throwing to Brentford He's one of the new faces the five new signings Aaron Hickey the young Scottish international the 20 year old After a couple of seasons in Italy was signed from Bologna, but great things were being said about him During the course of last season had a full season with them I think you have to say Glenn I think Brentford done some very interesting business This summer with some of the signings they've made like Hickey like Mikael dams guard who's on the bench the signing this week That isn't the word I would use interesting I would say it's been shrewd it's young it's talented and it's moldable and it fits into the Brentford system And that's what they do and that's why I think Manchester United is so far behind They're competitive because there's a plan that all the places here's Rashford on the edge of the area hits the shot But there were two Brentford defenders there Rooslav and Jansen were together Brentford Switched to three central defenders in their comeback against Leicester. That's how they've started here Me heads the ball out to Dalor and now Manchester United again Dalor on the edge of the area He hits a low shot, but Ryder is able to get down to his right quite comfortably He slipped as he hit it so it lacked power and it was just down to the goalkeepers, right? But Eric Tenhag will be happy seeing his right back in the opposition 18-yard box unleashing shot It wasn't quite the didn't quite have the power or accuracy he wanted But it is a positive for Manchester tonight, and I think any positive from the moment is a plus Brentford to Manchester United nil and Brentford you cannot take your eyes off this and Bermol plays it back to The ball that is hit over the top by Tony and eventually it does roll out of play Shepard it out by Ericsson. Yes, I mean shepherd it out 20 yards behind anyone else in the Manchester United shirt is Ericsson how how is that possible? How's it not a right a left back or a centre back as we as we just pause for a dream spirit breaker? One question I wanted to ask you John is Obviously when Manchester United look at the opening fixtures of the season they see bright Brighton and they see Brentford and They obviously think there's points there to be had I mean there's a long way left to go in this fixture But I wanted to pick you up on the on the stat you gave us the last time Manchester United lost two games Do you know who they were against? When they lost first two matches of the season the new manager or the new manager Back in 1921. No, do you know? No, I don't know. It's your start. Glenn I had enough trouble finding out who the manager was I've been trying to find that out all week, and I found out this afternoon at about 2 o'clock I was teeing you up there. I thought I thought I was doing you a favour John. Well, that just goes to show There's always more isn't there when you look up something like that. What I can tell you is that The the man who what was the manager who lost lost his first two matches John Chapman who was a Scotsman He was Manchester United's sixth manager in there in their history and they did they finished bottom that season Were relegated to division two but what I love about it is that three years later when Manchester United came back He was still the manager So he took them down, but three years later brought them back up. Well, I think that's the case I don't think we've seen Eric Tenharg again in three years. I was just gonna say Manchester United United finished bottom this season. I Think you're absolutely right. I think it'll be a long gone. But listen There's a long way to go and I think actually the fat and the drinks breakers now come to an end incidentally I think the very fact that we're seeing the same sort of mistakes happening Almost underlines the fact that Eric Tenharg Has not had time to have a proper influence yet. I don't think they're the same mistakes that happened last weekend I think that Brighton were the better team last weekend in this affair I don't feel as though Brentford have really come out and play much They've just pounced on opportunities that Manchester United have gifted them I mean that Brentford have been happy sitting in their shape for large periods of this game There's Brentford come forward again Brentford to Manchester United nil in this hot sunshine And Manchester United through McGuire just clearing the ball away and bounces out of play on the halfway line The point I'm making Glen is not so much last weekend's mistakes Mistakes that have been happening to Manchester United for years now under a string of different managers. Yeah, you're right It is yours. It is it's It's it's incredible to see how far they have fallen Well, they're falling to defeat here to nil down a long way to go in the match still Just under three quarters of the 90 minutes to play as the ball is played in field It's taken in field by no guard who is tripped. It's a free kick near the right edge of the box Glen I I've just watched Bruno Fernandez clearly tripped the Brentford player and then is just eyes into the referee with his arms out stretching His morning. It's a clear free kick. I what is the point of it's still morning at Stuart at will now? Yep Truntering away Let's do it that well and and that boils down to frustration that that's what it is It's frustration himself I his team at the situation they find themselves in and he's looking from external sources to take it out on So it's just having a drinks break then rather carelessly didn't have a drinks break when the players were having a drinks break Jensen to take this free kick then two man United wall lots of red and white striped Brentford shirts there inside the penalty area Jensen raises his arm curls it. Oh nicely on to here diving to his right I mean that was so close to getting a touch from one of the heads in there whether it was a Brentford or Manchester United Man they dive to his right pushed it away And now there's a foul on the far side and it's a free kick to Manchester United to Brentford in the Manchester United right back area And the pressure is growing on Manchester United But what is saved by Dehaire because like you said there could have been a touch on that the goalkeeper can't go too early It's going across his goal if he goes to early somebody gets a touch it goes into an empty net He timed that perfectly the Spanish goalkeeper and pushed it to relative safety so a free kick that Jensen has wandered across to take again So then me is still up there another one of those new signings We'll come back to that Glenn when we get a chance, but Pondess Jensen as well the captain is in there too so considerable presence from those two Free kick then from the left right footed from Jensen into the near post and it's deflected a right across the penalty area There were I mean a two players from each side going for that And in the end Rashford deflects the ball behind from Norgaard's cross high up into the stand for another corner to Brentford I mean Thomas Frank can't want any more from that free kick from Jensen. He's a superb free kick It's right on the money. It's in the danger area Luckily for Munch United they managed to scramble it clear set piece delivery has been outstanding and now Cue this corner hit in the front post Well, I sat and watched Chelsea hit corner after corner this time last week in the first half the Brentford players group together now They head in all sorts of different directions. There are two potential takers. It's in Burma Oh, it says no it's to the back post and it's headed back across for Brentford And the ball drops into the net Ben me gonna touch to it the goal stands Then me raises away and punches the air And it's Brentford three Manchester United now and they simply didn't deal with it a back post header The drop across the face of the goal and then me almost on the goal line getting some sort of touch did affect it in And I'm not sure this Manchester United side are going to be capable of coming back from this even though We've got an hour to play it's Brentford three Manchester United Neil It's a routine corner to the back stick, but it's the big man Ivan Tony that wins the ball and Somehow Ben me almost falls and heads it into the back of the net at the back stick To make it three Neil to Brentford and the Manchester United players shrudge out of their rating yard books heads hung in shame Simple set-piece goal well worked set-piece goal Yes, and it's funny because Eric Tenhag he highlighted that point this week, didn't he? How the set-piece goal last weekend against Brighton was a plus because they've been so bad at them last season And then he sees his side do that and he's onwards Delivery was brilliant though and Burma who took it with a left foot somebody's run onto the field So we've got it. We've got a delay here. I don't know if he's had too much son or too much for you There possibly a combination of them both but he's been wrestled over ground by the stewards and under the new rules this this season I mean, this is where it's This is where it's up This is where it's absolute madness because this this young man. I mean he's banned now He's banned from going to football and rightfully so John. You can't be running the field to play No any any point in any game. It's just unacceptable behavior, especially with some of the scenes we saw at the end of last season so three Nilda Brentford I mean it was The scoreline was a surprise last Sunday, you know Brendan Brent Brighton having never won there Against Manchester United, but they played so well Brighton in the first half particularly, but this I mean this is This is just extraordinary. I mean, I know I know we're sitting here and Brentford are three little up Do you but do you think they've played that well John? I don't actually that's that's the funny thing Had to Manchester United created their own issues and and not defended properly and they find themselves three in the down and they pretty much are the only three Opportunities if you can call them that the Brentford have had Well, Mark Chapman will round everything up for you That's happened today in the sporting world at halftime Arsenal and Manchester City have got two wins out of two now Also among the main stories Alexander Mitrovich having late penalty saved in Wolves in fulham's nil nil at Wolves Big win from Rangers four nil against St. Johnston The QPR goalkeeper scoring late on to make it 2-2 at Sunderland and we will hear from Ralph Hassan-Hoodle The Southampton manager after their 2-2 with leads and also from Brendan Rogers the Leicester City manager after that 4-2 defeat at Arsenal that is all coming up at halftime on five live But the big story of the day is happening and unfolding right in front of our eyes here at the community stadium in West London Between the M4 and the River Thames in this stifling sunshine And and I think that in itself is another point in these conditions From Manchester United to have to come from three nil down and that is going to take a Herculean effort Yes, and as you were given that report there the Brentford fans were in full voice and they were singing you should have stayed at a big club I wonder who that was in wonder I wonder for Christian Ericsson Wasn't supposed to happen this way Fernandez crossing the ball out towards the right-hand side Daloh in the shadows to our left Sancho back to Daloh then Sancho again a dart into the penalty area a little ball through for Fred Fred is forced wide He has to give it back out to Daloh Dalos low ball across Sancho took a touch, but it bounced away from him And there are so many numbers in there Brentford have got everyone in there that you know This back five that it is and they clear the ball downfield and now it's played across from Bournemouth And Bournemouth gets away from Shaw and scores and it's four nil this time on the counter attack Brentford have not witnessed anything like this for decades and decades and decades There's four nil up on Manchester United This is dream land for their man for Thomas Frank, but it's a living nightmare But that man's out there the new Manchester United manager Eric Tenhark who sits quietly in his seat This score line will be being sent out all around the world and it is Brentford for Manchester United nil People all over the world will be sitting up and noticing this result for nil already before halftime the mighty Manchester United undone by Brentford football club and that goal right there was Absolutely brilliant. They won the ball in their own eight in the air box pleaded down the channel Tony was free to run down the channel He plays it into the center of the field Brian and Bournemouth Bursa and his guts together has a touch and plays it to the right hand side nice hard and low side footed down the side of David Dehaier to make it four nil and it is absolutely humble. I'm lost for words John I really am this is incredible what we witness in here But I mean this is on a par and you don't have to go back far This is on a par with their penultimate match of last season when they lost four nil at Brighton And in actual fact this I mean this has to be a defeat now I mean surely they can't come back from this and if that's the case that will be eight consecutive league away defeats for for Manchester United And I mean that has not happened that a run like that has not happened since 1936 and actually strangely Within that run back in 1936 of what turned out to be ten consecutive away league defeats in a role They lost four nil away to Brentford Isn't it strange it is how how it you get quirks like that, but this is the present day This is 2022 and this is unreal. It's four nil to Brentford Here's the man who scored the latest goal and Bermol and and suddenly Brentford out knocking the ball around on the edge of the box De Silva who started the corner the scoring gives it to the left-hand side the cross from me. That's headed away by Shaw De Silva a heavy touch and then it's won back By Hickey who actually hurt himself in the challenge on Fred and Manchester United in the end actually come out with the ball Less than ten minutes to go to halftime Bruno Fernandez long downfield Rashford and Ria has come out of his goal and the goalkeeper got a meaningful touch It was an aerial challenge actually between him and Rashford And Rashford has been left on the ground. I don't think I was a suggestion that that was a foul By by Ria who was challenging no ball seen cleanly for the ball, but he's caught Rashford Yes, both plays it was an honest attempt from both plays to get the ball And it was just a collision as they were both running to one other's Ria comes out He gets a good chunk of the ball And he cleans his two to safety Glenn you had a long career as a professional footballer what 20 years are there about? Yes, you don't see you don't see Occasions like this too often do you I mean this feels No, this feels massive That's why I just said I'm lost for words and it's not being in dressing rooms of clubs the sort of similar size to to Bremford and and before this game there There would have been a belief that they could go out there and and beat this current Manchester United crop when they seen the line up Obviously what's going on the football club at the moment that there would have been a slight belief But there would have been a worry as well But slowly throughout this first half where you've seen that belief grow into confidence and they're smoking the ball around now And as you can hear I mean the the Bremford fans are in absolute dreamland and I just wonder Does it get any better for a Brentwood supporter? Well Marcus Rashford who was clevered by David Ryan who headed the ball away and then caught Rashford obviously they're taking care with him Marcus Rashford was very much in the news at the moment clearly PSG are interested But Eric Ten Haag was making it very plain yesterday that he wants him to stay But I mean what a star this is losing to want a Brighton in his first Premier League match and now four-nil down at Bremford Brighton and Brentford with all due respect Then they do deserve respect both of them For what Brighton did last weekend and for what Brentford have done here but Even so I mean There are fractions in the Manchester United side that you can see that the players aren't happy But I think the biggest problem for me is that triangle at the back Is Martinez, McGuire and Dehaier? They don't look comfortable together and as that fourth goal goal went in I could see McGuire going back towards his goalkeeper and centre-back partner With his arms flailing in the air and that isn't what you want You need to be a team whether you're winning or losing you need to do it together and at the moment Manchester United and yeah, that there just looks to be a greater hunger out there I must say we're watching now Brentford and and Roe Sleve and no guard De Silva. I mean De Silva looks I mean talk about Hungary looks as though he hasn't eaten for a fortnight I mean I would I would really like to see the stats that they're running the high speed running and the distance covered because The fundamentals of football you take all talent out of it and the least you can do is work hard And I just question this Manchester United group Are they working hard enough regardless of if their actions are correct if their decisions are correct? Are they working hard enough and that is the easiest thing to do as a footballer? Brentford it is in possession warm applause The second season in the Premier League They were terrific the way that they came back and got a point at Leicester last weekend But they've been out of this world against Manchester United here taking the chances But here's Rashford into the penalty area and Rashford trying to work the ball across took a deflection But David Ryer was able to drop onto it and hold it securely This is BBC Radio 5 Live on a Saturday night and what a story we're bringing you in this 530 kickoff Brentford for Manchester United nil Four goals from four different players Josh De Silva in the 10th minute Matthias Jensen in the 18th Ben me in the 30th his first goal for the club on his home debut and Brian and Burma in the 35th John you need to start giving a warning out before you deliver that because there'll be people out there Crushing there'll be accidents people falling off seats because that it's incredible, isn't it? It's not even half-time and it's 4-0 to Brentford as if we haven't got enough to worry about at the moment Balls played forward up towards Rashford, but it bounces off reverse level out of play for a throw in C United near the halfway line United's substitutes today Malasia verran Juan Bersaca Vanda Bake Alanga Ghana Mctominet and Garnaccio as well as Tom Heaton United coming forward But I mean frankly four nil down in these conditions in these sweltering conditions I mean normally four nil down you would say no but It has to be too much on a day like this Yes, I mean it would be an absolutely incredible comeback that they are probing they are showing signs of life But Brentford are just so comfortable sat in their shoes. Yes, Fernandez Fernandez on the edge of the area shoots But that's blocked again there are two Brentford defenders in the way as a softened being the case Sure plays it square has happened before of course remember check Teotate and Arsenal a new castle but just Sitting here. It's all very well talking about that sitting here inside the ground and feeling what this is like and And the way that the players have been the way the crowd are just the reaction of the players That's why I'm saying there's over half the game to play but I cannot say it We've just witnessed Martin as the the the deepest play for Manchester United in possession of the ball Trying cut back across when Burma. I mean why would you risk that? The Brentford players in on goal if he robs you there of the ball I mean he needs to get up to speed with the Premier League better from United working it on the edge of the area Fred and Fernandez sure tries to play it in it bounces away Erickson nods it forward Half cleared away nodded in by McGuire headed away by Ben me and then McGuire out towards the right-hand side Manchester United are parked inside the Brentford half, but they're four-nil down As Bruno Fernandez is going to try a shot from 22 23 yards out But it curls away over by a couple of yards But a happy with them shooting through people shooting from 25 yards And you say that Manchester United a camped in the Brentford half I think that's Brentford allowing them to camping there I think Brentford are happy to sit in their shape their two banks everyone behind there the ball and I'm just wondering if this is a tactic from Thomas Frank to conserve energy and Just sit and allow Manchester United to run make make runs that they're not going to get the ball on and and just waste energy and time at this point Yeah, one of the Brentford regulars when we were talking about the match this afternoon Glen before the game He actually said he said Brentford have got as much energy as any team in the Premier League when we're talking about the conditions and I mean the brilliantly coached Thomas Frank he's won a lot of friends hasn't he and a lot of admirers this this Danish coach Yeah, he has indeed and and and deservedly so but It's not just Thomas Frank. It's everybody the football club There's a clear philosophy that everyone's pulling in the right direction and this is this is what happens when you get that Well, they're equaling their record win at the moment against Manchester United That was that 4-0 in division one back in 1947 there They're only previous spelled in the top flight when they were there either side of World War two But this will be Manchester United's first Defeat to Brentford since then first time they've lost to Brentford since before the second World War 4-0 Four additional minutes will be played at the end of this first half, but what a first half we've seen here Long and forward Roerslav is underneath that one of the two players that Thomas Frank brought into his side changed to Start with three central defenders having finished the game against Leicester with three and making that comeback So what a start to the season it is for them to nail down Against Leicester, but then getting a point from that match and now starting here But helped by those early errors by Manchester United David to here you'll see it on match of the day tonight You'll be able to talk about it on 6-0-6 as well By the way from 7 30 or thereabouts with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton sure playing the ball into the Brentford box Raya comes for it gets a hand to it that Rico Henry is on hand Just a stoop and head the ball back to his goalkeeper and he's got it safely Yes, we'll hear from Chris and Robbie at half time Once we've rounded everything up with Mark Chapman, but I did look on the website yesterday at Chris Sutton's Predictions and I saw that he predicted a 3-0 win for Brenton for Brentford in this match And I thought to myself Good old Chris. There he is. He's stirring up a few with that. Actually, he's been he's been too conservative Incredibly well Brentford haven't been first a match of the day very often, but I think tonight the fans will get just what they want They will and sadly so will Manchester United be first on just like last Sunday night as well after the the Brighton defeat and McGuire is Just dwelling on the ball Tony is all over the back of him. He was able to flick it back to goalkeeper to here and and now Challenge from from Hickey who goes in rather strongly on Ronaldo, but there were two of them there It was Janssen and Hickey together. They sandwiched Ronaldo not letting them settle. Okay. It's a foul It's a free-kick and no more. He's just stepped across Ronaldo Ronaldo I think was happy he was going no way is happy to buy that free-kick and Manchester United are gonna load the box for What could possibly be one the last efforts of the first half? I can see the television cameraman down there just hovering next to Eric Ten Haag I mean what a first half for him When you thought it perhaps couldn't get any worse It just has free kick is played in by Ericsson, but Raya comes very confidently and catches the ball We've still got a minute and a half of the first half added time to play But Eric Ten Haag, you know, he's been a serial winner at Ajax Winner of the league title with them the last couple of seasons Managed to the big club, but now he is facing The Unprecedented pressure of being the manager of Manchester United when things are not going well this this is without doubt the biggest test he'll have in his career and I think you look at Manchester United from the outside and the size of the club lords you in but for me at the moment It's a poison chalice. I think that It all boils down to the owners to the owners one success. Are they back in Manchester United enough? I think there's a huge question mark hanging over that we talk about Brentford and how everyone's pulling in one direction. There's the philosophy The exact opposite to Manchester United Fred Conceits a free kick Brentford played in the ensign into the penalty area A stretch and away from Martinez who was up against Norgaard near the corner of the six yard box Well, they've already scored from a corner from this side Surely not another one Just before the break to round it all off The last one was brilliantly delivered if you remember if you were listening by unburmold to the back post and Tony got up for that What have they got this time up there up there Brentford sleeves? Well, the players gathered together near the penalty spot all of them head in different directions again And here is the delivery this time. It's actually from Jensen, but that's deep as well It's taken down by Tony who backed away. He tried to play it across the penalty area was cut out by Fred And there is the halftime whistle and Manchester United are put out of their misery for well 15 minutes of the Of the halftime break in the cool of the dressing room, but what a a red hot What a white hot first half for Brentford who are winning 4-0 against Manchester United It's just been remarkable Glen Murray. It has been an absolutely incredible There's two people I watch trudge off that field there and I'd love to give a penny for their thoughts once Cristiano Ronaldo The heights at which he left this football club on what he's returned to and the other ones Christian Ericsson who must Be thinking he's gonna wake up at any point because this is a living nightmare It is yeah, Eric Tynhard facing defeat in his second match And facing the possibility in fact the likelihood of being the first Manchester United manager to lose his first two matches in Charge since 1921 That simply cannot see them coming back from Brentford for Manchester United nil here at halftime And you look at that cladonian thinking if only United had managed to get Marco and out of it in this week Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking actually choppers I mean good grief I mean look look this is this is a well-run well coached Football club with the players that the head coach wants with a system that works in modern 21st century football against a club that appears absolutely Rotten from the top to the bottom Isn't it? I don't know why you sound so surprised. I know I'm not surprised. I mean it was the same last week You know the surprise around Brighton winning. It's exactly the same thing Brighton Brentford Well run well coached everybody pulling in the same direction Manches United rotten rotten rotten rotten a change of the helm is not gonna change this football club Well, I say helm and by helm I made the manager the hierarchy if that was to change then I think that the club could possibly get back on track I mean we've heard the the Superstars that made Manchester United Such a driving force in them in that while I say the modern-day game But those times have gone I suppose your Gary Neville's your Roy Keane's your real Ferdinand's And you know what I actually really feel for those fellas because they made they made this club what it is You can't live in the past No, you can't determine to live in the past like it's a 90s theme park But it must hurt those guys that made the club so great to see it falling so badly at the moment For all for all that all the you know you could criticize systems and this that and the other Brentford know that Manchester United can't play out from the back So John said they run more than anybody else. They've got more energy than anybody else So they press and they press and they cause Manchester United problems because because Brentford know how as Brighton did know how to work United Oh, I mean hard work beats talent every day if talent doesn't have to work hard and that is it's an old adage But for me that sums Manchester United up at the moment They have got superstars listen Jaden Sancho was absolutely superb in Germany for Dortmund He was brilliant in the Champions League. He doesn't come to Manchester United and all of a sudden become a bad player It's the system. It's the structure. It's the football club More from John and Glenn second half on the way the lines are open I think for 606 0808 5 909 693 you can get your calls in now you can text 85058 and book your call as well in the hundred earlier wins for Trent Rockets women and men in the games against Manchester Originals Birmingham's women beat Welsh fire women earlier the men get out adjust underway aren't they Charlie Taylor It's been a great start for Welsh fire They opted to bowl and they had Birmingham Phoenix 27 for 3 after the power play the huge wickets of will smeed out for a duck Mowen strangled down the leg side and Livingstone bold trying to scoop so Welsh fire very much on top here at the moment It is 29 for 3 after 31 balls and as you said earlier today Birmingham Phoenix women beating the Welsh fire So hoping for a bit of a comeback And you can listen to that on sports actually you'll hear from Ralph Hassenhutle and Brendan Rogers during half Time and at full time of course it's Chris and Rob who is 6 0 6 Matthew Bohn has your news 24 minutes past six Listen on BBC sounds This is BBC radio 5 live the man accused of stabbing the author Sir Salman Rushdie has been charged with attempted murder Sir Salman is currently on a ventilator in hospital after he was stabbed at an event in New York State He has been the target of death threats for decades after he wrote the controversial book the satanic verses which some Muslims consider blasphemous Correspondents Nomia Iqbal is outside the hospital in Pennsylvania and says his security had been more relaxed in recent years Three years ago I interviewed him at a literature festival in the UK and he turned up with his son and he had his agent and I asked him Where his security was and he almost brushed it off and he said well, you know that those risks were of the past You know throughout the 90s He was obviously one of the most endangered authors, but he said he wanted to live his life more freely The MP Jonathan Edwards has been told to resign by the leader of his plight-cum-ree party after assaulting his wife two years ago Mr. Edwards was given a police caution following the incident and sat as an independent until the whip was restored this week Officials representing train drivers will hold formal talks with rail bosses next week to try to settle a dispute over paying conditions A strike by workers in the Aslef Union has brought descriptions to railways today and Taliban forces and the Afghan capital Kabul have fired guns into the air to disperse a women's rights protest Around 40 women marched in front of the education ministry chanting bread work freedom marking a year since the Taliban takeover This has been shepherd and Chris Kamara and we can't wait to bring you our new podcast carrying Ben's proper football podcast What can people expect cam big names big laughs?

It's like I saw I quite literally found every outfield You don't want to miss it carrying Ben's proper football podcast with me Ben shepherd and my mate Chris Kamara Listen on BBC sounds Sports report. This is BBC five live Halftime at Bremford Bremford for Manchester United nil elsewhere in the Premier League today Aston Villa one Everton, sorry Aston Villa two Everton one Arsenal four Leicester two Brighton nil Newcastle nil Manchester City for Bournemouth nil Wolves nil Fulham nil and at St Mary's Southampton came from two down To get a point at home to leads with goals from Joe Arribo and Karl Walker Peters Afterwards Ralph Hassan Huttall spoke to Alistair Bruce Ball Ralph that was some turnaround in the last 20 minutes of the game some turnaround of atmosphere in the stadium as well wasn't it? Yeah, I knew over to down is clear that sphere is in the in the cellar and then you You dig yourself out of the cellar and then you you go and uh, I think we showed a fantastic reaction it was tough today And I think the guys gave a good answer today Yeah, it's interesting you say that Ralph in terms of a a good answer I mean if anyone wanted to watch Southampton today that last 20 minutes in particular showed the commitment to the cause do you feel? Yeah, but nothing else Was what I was expecting and if somebody else says something different Then I I should be careful Or you should be careful to spread this because Yeah, we know that this makes our life our life tougher my my job a little bit tougher, but uh This the important thing is that is that I that I know what I have with my team Yeah, does that does that um noise those stories? Well, you say it makes your job tough and how difficult is that to ignore? No, it would be easier when not Everybody tries to to take it and and get get a get a story out of it. It's it's shambles This is what I Meanwhile, I must say it's a little bit annoying In social media and in all this this this stuff what is coming, but yeah, maybe you have to live with this This is our job. We know this normally. I don't want to speak about it It's always good to to give a reaction on the pitch and and I think they Look the team gave the answer today. Although we took only the point We heard from Gabriel J. Zeus earlier on sports report. He got two arsenal goals as they beat Leicester For two Brendan Rodgers afterwards was asked what he wants to happen at the club over the next few weeks You know, I can only really concentrate on the players that we have. I'm no different to mckell. I'm no different to The other managers that you know that you want to be at the top end of the table you you you got to invest and you got to to bring in quality however The club had been great for me my time. He and I respect that we can't do that. We're not able to do that so So like I say my concentration then has to fall on the players. It's here But everyone knows when you can bring in players and bring in players of quality It's not just what that they bring in. It's the lift it gives All the other players and that's obviously something that we've missed It sounds like you said you almost got to suffer a period of change to go and progress forward again I think so. I think the the club has always been stable. They've it's been ran ever so well um so uh, so yeah, so I trust them and they tell me there's no resources to to do anything as of yet then, uh, you know, I I believe them so We're not one of the big clubs that the the pandemic didn't affect it really affected us Like I say, we're we're increasing the stadium. We've got 100 million pound training facility and so for a club like us And and the resources that we have and that's a big big outlay. So But we're not at the level and that's why these players have done amazing over the the three odd years I've I've been here to be challenging for champions league and winning some trophies, you know But but at this moment in time We we can't then push on and get in more players because we don't have those resources Now let's go to molly new where it finished nil nil means Bruna largest side I haven't actually won in nine premier league matches if you go back to their last top flight victory on the second of April alexander mitrovich also had the penalty saved for fulham here is large That's the balance that we need to grow up as a team because if we don't if we cannot Score goals at least we cannot concede or the other and or give chances to the opponent and in the end What you look for what you did all the game. I think we deserve the three points and when you come comes another time that you need to be in that point that Emotional control on it's important especially than I stand 15 minutes because the game were balanced I think with that period we have more fitness and and and strength than the opponent We need to keep going in our game Don't run as a as a crazy team, but stay focused stay in the game Keep control of the of the of the ball of the positions of the emotions and the goal will come and we don't concede spaces and chances for the opponent In the scottish Premiership range has made it three wins out of three with a four nil win over st Johnston the story in the championship QPR coming from two down to draw two all at sundell and their equaliser coming from their goalkeeper Sene Dieng here's his manager michael biel and he finished it really well. It's actually a really good technique So well played to him. He's very modest. So he's calmed down in there, but obviously his teammates making a fuss of him We're delighted. I thought just before that we had a wonderful opportunity with Sinclair Armstrong to equalize and we missed it And I thought that was the big moment gone Sene Dieng goes down the other end and makes a big save to secure the point. So that's it. He's I believe he's one of the best goalkeepers in this league. I think he's destined for really big things And we're delighted to have him as our goalkeeper Michael Biel don't forget you can see everything Premier League wise Match the day tonight, which is 10 20 on BBC one with shearer and mica alongside gary Premier League Sunday tomorrow nottingham forest west ham And then chelsea at home to Tottenham Another 45 minutes of bruna finanda is walking around flapping his hands in the air follows and then it's uh 606 with robbie and chris Thanks so much chappers before we talk about Manchester united. You heard brennan rogers there chris. What what do you make of that? Yeah, just it's really i'm not here from leicester city fans tonight Manchester united, you know Clearly the biggest story in town, but just how despondent brennan rogers, you know was there can't bring in Any players of quality i'm not so sure he's going to be around much longer at least I don't think he's going to part with that. Let's talk about man. Just united rob. I mean where where do you stop? Can they turn it around the second? You're better than that, but I mean do you think ten harga's thinking blimey wide? Why did I bother? This isn't on ten harg, right? Or is it? No, of course not he needs a lot of time But you look at the way they're playing look at the structure of the team You look at the structure of the team last week christian ericsson players of force nine I don't know where that came from. So you're saying it's on ten harg? No last week before the team Structure of the team for me Obviously if you hear manchish united fans over the last couple of seasons we can't play with two number sixes today's gone with Fred is one six Then you've got five attacking players away from home five attacking players in the side you're wide wide open So I think it's massive. It's not ten harg's fault. He needs time Recruitment recruitment Let's me talk about in the show, but the recruitment over the years has been so so bad Where is rabbi on the list and out of it's who's who's evil? Where where are they on the list of my night when they're looking for players? I don't get it chris It's an absolute shambles, but ten harg needs time but brentford for nil chris Yeah, I mean incredible performance from from brentford, but where does this manchish united performance rank? Then in in the history of manchish united, where does that first 45 minutes rank? Let's hear from manchish united fans. Oh eight. Oh eight five nine nine six nine three Well john murray and glen murray there john. Where does this rank? Pretty low. I think I think you've picked the right word there robbie rank That's unusual And as I said in the first half chris you were too conservative with your predictions Yeah, well I went three now just off the back of last week You know, I thought it's going to be difficult for united to pick themselves up, but They've been pathetic. I tell you what I'll do. John if I was manchish tonight and I'd make a triple change I thought you might do that. Yeah. Well, that's very shrewd as ever Listen, um, enjoy the program right? Yeah, we'll be yeah We'll be giving it a push during the second half because there'll be plenty to talk about And and you know the other point is these manchish united fans those who've come down from the northwest of england You know with all of the travel problems today as well the train strike What a miserable experience from them but It's a triple change from eric tenhard at the start of the second half. So fred is off Shaw is off and martinez is off And the players who've come on as the second half begins with a scoreline of brendford four manchist united nil are mcdomenay molasia at left back and verand in central defense so a triple change but You know the the horse has bolted glenn moray Well the one change that I look at there and I'm well, I'm not surprised but Is martinez To to drag and I call it drag because that's what he's done He's dragged him off at halftime the shepherd took as we call it and bring verand on I think speaks absolute volumes of this manchish united group. Well He is he's new to the club martinez It's his second match as you'll be well aware They they spent something in the region of 47 million pounds And this was a player that eric tenhard knew extremely well because he was his player of the year At iac's last season when they won the league in holland I don't know there was there's quite a bit of talk before the game that verand might start this match So maybe there's been a decision there and he's decided You know now's the time to bring verand in because there've been fitness issues there as well Not that the down four nil well I mean you had to change something I I do feel for martinez because as soon as he's joined manchish united he's been questioned about his height Uh, that has got to affect you in in some capacity Even if it is subconsciously the things he's taken on board via his phone via Papers and things like that But then to be dragged by the man that brought you here at halftime in the second in your second start I mean his confidence must be absolutely rock bottom four nil Brentford red and white striped shirts black shorts black socks On the way to a famous victory one of their best four nil three on three and And berma trying to hit the pass early those Three players nor guard was in the middle toni was up there as well. They take a quick free kick Henry is onto this the left wing back He crosses and it's cleared away at the near post and out of play for a throwing to Brentford down the left They're playing from the the right to the left In the in the second half towards what we might call the sun end The sun is up there in the sky right behind that stand blazing down on west london Throw in ten yards back from the corner flag. So it is one of the Brentford specialities It's the long throw I'm anxious united going to be capable of dealing with it Jensen is right up against the advertising hoardings Here he comes the long throw spear into the near post me got a touch And it was cleared away near the edge of the box by finandez and Brentford start again So Brentford as they were in the first half as you would expect raya in goal. He's Clearing it downfield now and it's headed out of play by dallow the three central defenders roerslav Jansen and me Hickey on the right Henry on the left and nor guard and Jensen and berma and disilva And toni as the central striker and Manchester united their rejig team at halftime. I'll run you through that But they've got to throw in again Brentford this one's taken short by Jensen. He gets it back crosses it in It's cleared out to Henry who chips it back out to Jensen on the left hand side Jensen is up against the newly arrived mcdomen a takes him on towards the the dead ball line on the left hand side But mcdomen a has managed to get a foot in and clear it back up the line And it eventually bounces off mcdomen a and behind the corner to Brentford. That's a cheap one It was actually a pass back from sancho that tried to find mcdomen a just missed him and it rolls Pathetically out for a Brentford corner and their two players exchanged looks of Disillusion daggers. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah daggers. Yeah, they they uh, I mean that sums it up It's another one of those days for Manchester united I mentioned the fact that this will be Brentford's first win against Manchester united since before the second world war There's more on that because Brentford have got this corner first which Jensen takes into the near post It's bounced a long way out towards the far side of the penalty area Tony gives it to the right It's driven into the near post and Dehaio is able to get down there and block it with his legs United scrape it away and then Tony out there on the right has a right Lash at it with his right foot and it flashes wide and behind into the Brentford fans And you know what if Tony was a little bit more composed there and just felt that ball back into the back into the area Brentford had three players on the backstick He would it headed into an empty goal a little bit of a composure from Brentford And it could have been five as and since uh since Brentford last beat Manchester United Which as I say was back in there and an FA cup tie in 1938 in all of the games they've played and there have not been that many six Uh wins for united one draw in all of the matches they've played since the second world war Brentford have scored more goals in this match Than they've scored in all of the games they've played against Manchester united put together since the second world war So uh united I mean it's it's one damning fact and statistic after another but here they come now Trying to do something about this dallow chips it in and it's headed down and wide by Cristiano Ronaldo He had to he had to stoop. He was slightly behind ahead of it, but headed it wide On the bounce I think by his own personal standards Ronaldo should be scoring there He watches the ball in no one gets in the way of it. It's right onto his head. Yes granted It might be slightly behind him, but a player is ilk can change his body shape just slightly and feel that back on go on target And I think when he sees that back tonight, I'll be disappointed But I don't think it'll make much difference to the outcome five live and bbc sounds Four nil to Brentford the goals from De Silva. That was a De here era Uh Jensen that was a christian ericsson Era he was caught on the ball in his own penalty area Ben me then in the aftermath of a corner And then brian umbermo scoring the fourth on the counter attack after manchester united had the ball Down the other end so four nil it is and united in these rather sickly yellowy green shirts sickly All right, here's sancho sancho a change of feet and then again, but it's all rather laboured Bruno Fernandez is behind him Bruno Fernandez crosses right footed right across the penalty area hiki follows it out there with rashford rashford works it back to Malacia the uh the new left back And then scott mcdomenay chips it to the right corner of the box to dallol left footed ball in from him and the header from rinaldo 10 yards out 12 yards out lands on the roof of the net again rinaldo man of his standards The ball comes in from the same side dallol swings it with his left foot He feels it towards gull and that is mightily closer dropping in that top corner of david reyer's gull Landed on the roof of the net though So the manchester united team now glenn in the second half to here in gull gallo maguire verran and malacia So two substitutes in the back four then scott mcdomenay with bruno fernandez and christian ericsson santo and rashford in the wide positions And rinaldo up front so i rick tenhard making one change from last week's starting lineup But now making three changes at halftime and another thing as well glenn Must mention is i just thought as well having had a week to work with manchester united this week to build up to this game For for that reason almost alone. I was expecting more of manchester united And this is all the more damning in the light of that There's no guard plays it forward and then back it goes to the halfway line russ left to the right brendford lose possession And it's won back by bruno fernandez who passes it to rashford on the halfway line and rashford passes it down the line But there's no way bruno fernandez is reaching that took a deflection though It's out of play for a throwing two manchester united rashford played it off the defender I mean that that that piece of play there was a knight he was nice little link up between rinaldo and fernandez But when that gets passed back to fernandez and he's looking forward There's no one in front of him no one's breaking their neck to to get behind that brendford line and santo I watched on this opposite side just canter into the middle He didn't even try to make a run forward and that's what manchester united lack Here is rashford might get away down the left that cuts back onto his right foot and In that moment russ left is onto him and puts in the block and the ball bounces away towards the halfway line and he's sweltering conditions The players around about two-thirds of the pitch is in this bright sunshine And sancho now moving in from the right hand side gives it to rinaldo square from him fernandez allows it to run malaccio is going to try a shot But it hits russ left inside the penalty area and bounces away for brendford to clear up to to tony on the halfway line tony battling with maguire who who does win the header against tony Oh, and that was very nearly unburmours onto that ericsson was just able to take it away from his former teammate christian ericsson And gives it out to the left hand side ericsson gets it back rinaldo ten yards inside the brendford half and I think this half obviously thomas franken in the dressing about half time I think the biggest he would have to do is calm his players down He has dallow now into the penalty area on the right hand side chips it across But chips it wide and over the top of the crossbar and behind goal kick for nil brendford glenn murray I just I just picking up on that point I was making of thomas franken and calm and his players down. I mean they must be an absolute dreamland right now and They've got in there. I mean they must have been pretty pretty hyped at halftime And I think his job is we need to manage this game boys. Take this thing out of it. We don't need to score again We just need to control as much as we can and keep our heads when we're in such an ascended ascended position Well, it's it's red hot and it should be red hot for callers on 606 tonight after this manchester united supporters You'll want to talk to to robbie and to chris you can book your calls now on 0808 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 Get in touch on 8 5 0 5 8 to book your call on the text or Similarly on social media get involved hashtag bbc 606 and you can read all about the the day is sporting and footballing events Of course on the bbc sport website and app and then the highlights on match of the day tonight on bbc one and as we've suggested This will be top of the bill. I don't think there's any doubt about that No, I don't think there is and just chatting about erik ten hags And substitutions at halftime and I understand melasia a new player coming into the football club I kind of understand verand just to show that back line up, but Why not bring vander beek on he's he's former player big question mark for me I thought he would have been one of the first on the team sheet when I seen erik ten hag become the manchester united manager and another thing he's brought players on that Can I say tried and tested he's seen them. He's seen what they can do. Why not bring ganache on why not bring a languron? Well, we might see them yet But it is brentford who come forward after manchester united lost possession But melasia was able to close down the attempted crossing it bounces behind for a corner to brentford And they've been so effective in I mean the plans talk about plans coming together. I mean that has happened Time and time again for brentford while manchester united's best-laid plans have fallen apart And jensen and and bermaul walk together Something almost romantic about that, isn't it the way that they walked holding the ball almost together Applauded by all of those fans in the lovely warm sunshine here moments to remember And bermaul And jensen it is jensen who takes this one It's a deep corner towards the back post and tony very nearly Got himself and it was only erikson who spotted him at the last moment who came across with a saving head I'd have put it behind from a for a corner from the other side Yes, the ball was quite high and tony was in a standing position just waiting for the ball to fall and it wouldn't quite fall quick enough He was willing it onto his head and as he was doing that erikson saw the danger and just nipped in to give brentford another corner And it's lovely again from bermaul and and jensen they're able to walk all the way across the pitch together and And get applauded all the way over. Well, I don't think those two players could be any happier on a football field right now john So who's going to take this one jensen or and bermaul? They're both standing off the pitch as that usual brentford movement inside the area It's jensen to the back post which is hooked away by rashford who was there and it's cleared further away by melasia On the edge of the box they're looking to break But it's and bermaul who gets there first ahead of jaden sancho The man who's just been involved in the taking of the corner snuffs out the manchester united counterattack And then ryer's able to fire a ball away downfield to start another brentford attack Which results in a throw in for the home side brentford for Manchester united nil if you've just switched on if you've been out involving the sunshine If you maybe just got back into the car you've been at the beach. You've not really been paying attention It's brentford for Manchester united nil for nil Yep for nil And it's a throwing for the home side cheered on by their supporters just their second season back in the premier league And here they are looking for what would be an extraordinary fifth goal and bermaul was very nearly in but melasia was able to put in the challenge And actually the flag was up against brian and bermaul and it's a free kick to Manchester united glenn murray We talk about Well at halftime we talked about a manchester united reaction. Didn't we if anything It's brentford that looked like they're going to extend their lead even more There's been no reaction from manchester united all the substitutes they've brought in as we see sancho Exit the field of play and bring on antonyla langer. So that comes immediately after Sancho was beaten by unbermaul there. Yeah the last action that manchester united had in the in the brentford half it was Basically, I would I would class it as a foot race between sancho and unbermaul And I think it boiled down to who wanted it more than it was unbermaul. He got there He made sure he got the ball. He took it from sancho. He was probably at one point in that race ahead of him And it just I mean those are the problems manchester united have and he boils down to that. I think hunger So sancho is off That's the the fourth change of the five that eric ten harg can make His team are four nil down. Alanga is on for sancho Alanga who are so score here last season when manchester united actually won three one in that match. They were Three nil up. Tony scored a late goal. I remember they came into that with a bit of pressure on them manchester united but Stood up to him on that occasion, but the fact is so often now they come into matches when there is pressure on them And very often they don't come look for the mark I remember playing manchester united teams in my career and You looked at them in the tunnel and they seemed like giants You were almost beaten by the badge before you went on on the field of play But now they've lost that for you factor manchester united as a football club regardless of how big they are How big their stadium is they're not a scary prospect anymore And uh a ponderous manchester united attack comes to an end with malacia caught in an offside position and This is brentford's first change And it is vitally janel the uh the german midfielder who is going to come on for josh the silver Who's had a brilliant start to the season after all of the problems that he's had you you might have been hearing or reading about him last weekend This hip injury that he had Four months on crutches then had a hamstring injury last season and he walks off the field now You know great ovation thomas frank shakes his hand Scored the opening goal today. It's been a lovely day in the sunshine for him So vitally or vitally they're singing his name the number 27 who uh Has got a sniff i think of getting into the german squad for the world cup another Hansy flick has supposedly been interested been to watch him so uh That is one with the world cup not too far away will be there and bringing all of that to you I suspect some days glenn in kata it might be cooler than it is here in brentford Maybe yes quite possibly but i think some of the stadiums if not all of them are air conditioned over there So that will be uh, that'll be quite nice from our point of view won't it john? It will yan elton's uh, slotted into that defensive midfield role, but manchester united coming forward with bruno finandez Four nil down manchester united rashford goes one way He comes short finandez passes the ball long it rolls past rashford runs out of play bruno finandez is is talking And talking and looking at rashford and waving his arms and telling him what he expected and now he's got his palms apart rashford's ignoring him That is not a good look from manchester united glenn murray No, and you mentioned those two players there That's just one of the problems. I mean it's right throughout this manchester united team. They're looking at one another. There's no cohesion. There's no understanding The question is is there a plan? Well, if there's not a plan that man down there in the gray Short sleeved shirt the black trousers the shaven head the dutchman eric ten hag He's got to find it. He's got to find a plan an effective plan One problem with that plan is manchester united's next match A week on monday is at home to libra pool christian erickson passing the ball forward into the Brentford half a langa comes short and then plays it back To the ran out to the left hand side to rinaldo who's dropped deep and is going to have a run at the Brentford defense It comes the challenge from yan elth who? forces rinaldo to Use mcdomon a and now the ball played out towards the left hand side Again, molasia is there the home supporters. It's party time in the stands in the home sections Manchester united fans. They had a huge anti-glazer banner by the way at halftime Which i guess they brought with them in any case because that's very much a theme of the moment But it was particularly pertinent when the team were four-nil down to brentford to unveil that in the stands You'll see pictures of that. I'm sure on social media Erickson playing a long pass over the top of dallow's running through and bouncing for a goal kick four-nil brentford and a big theme of this game john that we've sat here and watched this afternoon is brentford basically allowing manchester united to have the football and retreating into What can be described as One bank or two banks of four and just being hard to break down and basically manchester united not having the quality To be able to break them down and shooting from distance shooting through bodies and Basically brentford had just frustrated them into submission Brentford four-nil up but on the back foot now christian erickson turns looks faces the play plays it into the path of dallow Long floodlight shadow cast across the pitch at the feet of dallow and now plays the ball into tony But it bounces to maguire mcdomenay middle of the brentford half Stands up tall and plays the ball to the left hand side rashford afflicted by finandez But behind ronaldo and ben me was able to stretch in and and clear it away rashford Turn so there's a little touch from him there brunner finandez now down by the byline the defender slides in nor guard To put it behind from manchester united corner this is manchester united's first corner of the match With an hour and five minutes played And it actually looks As we see erickson just about to take this corner the manchester united fans having quite a bit of fun in that corner Yeah, they are uh, they're serenading erickson in there and the corner from him is over the top of brunner finandez Who then fells ben me As he's challenging for the ball he disputes that runa finandez It's a free kick to brentford who continue to leave for nil and the lines are open now for 606 with robby savage and chris sutton from round about half past seven 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 one match being played actually in the national league at the moment last i looked it was olden nil dorking nil and the hundred the cricket commentary is on sports extra right now live from cardiff So uh around about a quarter of the match to go There'll be great celebrations in this part of london tonight After a win like this and why wouldn't you want a beautiful evening as manchester united with rashford burst into the penalty area Diagonal run across the box turns crosses towards the header from erickson, but diving was right Ryre is able to catch the ball As he's almost fully extended And holds on to it And it's a 66th minute of this contest and that is the brightest bit of manchester united forward play we've seen all afternoon and it come from marcus rashford who Has been one of the brighter ones of the manchester united squad and he feels it back into christin erickson who rises tries to head the ball to the left Of him and it's quite a nice head. He's probably didn't have enough power on it and Rayo dives across to his right and caught it comfortably enough as we see the players Have another water break. Yep. Drinks break halfway through the second half So they've had that header from erickson. There was a rinaldo shot in the first half I think that's eight in terms of attempts on target from manchester united. Oh, yeah Yeah, the one early on. Yeah, he had another one that blazed over the bar. Yeah I mean they've like I say brentford have been comfortable sat in their shape and allowing manchester united to shoot from distance and frustrating them Did you say that you had a I I have got a fact of the day for me Well, I was playing might call it. Do you know what john? I was actually cleaning up your mess That's what I was doing because the fact that you gave us earlier on about the manchester united Have you got it? Yes, I have and the two teams that they were beaten by Whatever which was five mil and west brommage albion. Well done So that was that was the last time a manchester united manager a very very long time ago lost his first two competitive matches And that was that was john Chapman. I don't know if he was any relation. I doubt it because he's a scotsman That was they were his first two matches as the manchester united manager That was back in 1921 and no united manager since then has lost his first two matches So, uh, well done. I don't know when you had the time to look that up clen With your nose to the grindstone. Well the internet's a marvelous thing john. You've done very well Well, that's multi tasking on a grand scale So, uh drinks break almost over about manchester united wishlist match was almost over We've got lots of Lots more premier league for you tomorrow. Remember five live more premier league commentaries than than anywhere else Tomorrow two o'clock knottingham forest west ham. That should be a cracking occasion You'll hear that in full as a langa charges down a clearance from me and it's behind for a gold kick So that's a two o'clock kick off tomorrow I'm going to be going down to stanford bridge tomorrow for the 430 between chelsea and top them and uh We'll have coverage of course of all of the of the day's top sport all of football steve crossman's going to be presenting from the city ground and uh It is a gold kick to brentford Picking up on what you just said there john about the manchester united players probably wishing that they didn't have to go back out after that drinks break I just wonder if this was a boxing match if they would have thrown the towel in by this stage Well, I think being iced towel if they were going to throw a towel in That united banners come out again glenn united for sale They they want they i mean the they wish the hardcore of Manchester united fans are so desperate for a change of ownership You know, and it's the hardcore that follow manchester united to be away matches in the main I mean as as we speak in there they're blasting out united on never die and and and they are the people that keep football clubs alive Is this the supporters and this right here right now? He's probably the lowest ebb that most of those guys have ever seen in in manchester united history And I think he it just got past the point That they're not frustrated. They're not disappointing anymore They've just said let's have let's have a sing song and let's have a good afternoon and try and enjoy the sunshine in the sunshine Yeah, and you're talking about that generation in terms of what they've witnessed and all of the successes But it's been a It's been a tough 10 years 10 years next year Since they last won the premier league went to alex ferguson retired with that final blaze of glory but they're four nil down to To brentford so brentford are equaling their record their record win against manchester united Here's finna and there's though trying to reduce the deficit giving it a rash foot on the left hand side rash Fords cross that's headed away by jansen in the middle pontus jansen comes out to mcdomen air 25 yards out but brentford have got every single one of the red and white stripes back behind the ball So it is so congested in there and now malacia crosses from the left hand side It's over the top of elanga just wonder whether he might have been impeded by henry in the box He went sprawling couldn't reach it. There were no appeals Dallow with the outside of his boot plays it back towards the halfway line and now he has for an Rafa for an after all of his medal collecting with rail madrid There's no prospect of things improving in his second season and malacia Just miscontrolled that ball had to take it out had to race out to the left hand side and then gives it back to a little figure of christian erickson So important for brentford last season 11 appearances They won seven of the 10 matches that he started christian erickson And that's why they they finished up in 13th in the premier league last season here is Ronaldo now rinaldo gets it back gives it to malacia But they've got to try and find a way through all of these red and white shirts rashford tries to do that with a burst into the Box he's got support there from erickson erickson plays it across bounces off elanga though at the crucial moment 10 yards out and brentford clear Yes, and that ball almost fell to christiano rinaldo In fact, he did fall to him He just fluffed his lines because it he went to pass it with the side of his foot and he just missed the ball and it skipped past him Again, manches united falter in front of gul as rinaldo hits a shot on the turn, but I think the whistle had already gone in there I think it had it wouldn't have counted but it flew over the top of the the bar So a double change I think for brentford now one of the goalscorers brian and bermos scored the fourth goal running away on the counterattack beat luxe shaw to score it He's uh He is a typical A typical thomas frank brentford player, isn't he? Well the teams follow them and he's going to replace by joan wisah the democratic republic of congo international And matthias jensen who's had a very good game And he is replaced by shandon baptiste Who came on as a substitute at leicester last weekend as well. So baptiste is on And wisah is on And jensen has has really caught the eye today glenn murray. Yeah, he's kept the ball well And I think I think the key thing that is done whenever he's had the opportunity from especially a dead ball He's deliver his into the box of course Cause problems and they've been right on the money for brentford So wisah takes up a forward position brentford for manchester united nil Lines open for 606 08085 9096 93 to talk about this Four nil to brentford the score line of the weekend and just looking at those Those substitutions Wisa for me Could be a problem for manchester united He will want in on the act rashford now. This is hunger rides a couple of challenges. He's in the d Beat a couple of men gives it to rinaldo rinaldo now There's new energy in him a little flick behind the back of his heel gives it to rashford That's headed out to the left hand side malacia Suddenly there rinaldo and rashford looked like Changed men Malacia now on the left hand side back onto his right foot, but he's all left foot And he gives it to finandez and finaldes curls it into the back post dallo arriving But henry got there first with his head behind corner Henry's defended really well that back stick on a couple of occasions We watched the langer try and get on the inside of him just a few minutes ago and he bumped him Perfect defending and again dallo's got the run on him But he stands his ground and clears that ball. We've got henry's done a fantastic job 15 minutes to go four nil to brentford And manchester united's christian ericsson takes this to the near post comp beat nore guard Is able to head it away and wisser is chasing it and elanga is Has got there first, but they're tangling the two of them and he's been fouled by wisser and it's a free kick To manchester united he was playing for it But it's a free kick to manchester united but uh It just feels like it's a matter of just seeing the time down now for brentman brentford. Who would who would have thought that? molasia Just moving across wisser and playing it to the left hand side to to ericsson And then molasia left for the ball high into the box rya up high challenged by Fernandez the two of those a little bump between the two of them, but maya David rya caught it easily. I mean Fernandez gets A warranted knee into his into his leg there because he has no chance of getting that ball. He went in just to Upset rya. I think the the odds probably were more like 80 rya 20% Fernandez then it was it was a needless jumping and the manchester united number eight seems to have hurt himself a little bit there Yeah, I think he's all right So brentford's ball So four nil to brentford if you weren't listening earlier So this is equaling brentford's biggest win against manchester united It's going to be their first win against united since before the second world war It's going to be seven consecutive league away defeats in a role For for manchester united. That's not happened since 1936 Eric ten hargs going to be the first manchester united manager to lose his first two matches since 1921 And he'll be the first manchester united manager to lose his First away match since sat alex fergerson So at least he's in good company there. That's one positive stat there. You've just finished with john. Yes Throw in full manchester united halfway inside their own half Malacia to take this the brentford fans are getting excited about it on the far side I think they're just excited generally and then there's a foul by mcdomenay mcdomenay who many felt might have been shown a red card last week This is only a free kick and rightly so But it's a free kick the brentford and that's relieved the pressure. They've been under for For a few minutes or so, but I mean I say pressure. It's not been intense pressure because I think everyone here everyone assembled Inside the the g-tech community stadium knows what the outcome of this match is going to be three points to brentford non to manchester united I feel as though that has been thomas franc's tactics I think taken into consideration the heat of the days wanted his place to sit in and hit manchester united on the counterattack And that shows through the possession sats. I mean the away side manchester united who were four nil down Have 69 percent of possession free kick then that Yanelt is going to take I think there's two of them over there, but it is yanelt Who strikes it and he's missed it that all together and he's given it to rashford He was very nearly away on the counterattack until he was tripped by shandon batteast Who might be a little fortunate not to get a yellow card for that because rashford was away, but it's a free kick to manchester united But again from brentford game management that is that that as far as brentford are concerned Shandon batteast that is that is a good professional foul He stopped the attack and any opportunity that rashford might be able to open up his legs Four nil then and united take this free kick across that back line Oh eight oh eight five nine oh nine six nine three is the number to talk about this or any of the matches that you're at Or witnessed or want to speak about today? You'll find all of the details on the bbc sport website and app and match of the day tonight on bbc one Alan shearers birthday today. He's with michael richards alongside gary linicat and brentford are going to make their Their fourth and fifth changes and it's aron hickey who is Going to be the first man to come off And what a superb sign in that young man's being plucked from atlanta young scotsman come back to the uk And i'm sure he's absolutely loving life right now. Yeah Bologna actually it was very close together actually we were we were there last season bologna and atlanta But here he comes off the field very quietly gone about his business very impressive So he's on and mads speck sorenson Comes on so i guess roast level maybe move out to the right hand side of the defense and The other change sees frank onyeka Coming onto the field the nigerian international midfield at The number 15 and i think that's for christian norgad who's just walking behind the back of the goal and he's blending in To all the brentford shirt in the stand as he would Yes, i just wish as the uh long throw is taken for brentford and it comes out for the shot that is flashed in From henry from 25 yards through a crowd of players david to here to his right was able to make a A decent save actually got a good side of it. It wasn't too wide of him Yeah, it was a good save. It was a really good strike by henry. He caught on his left foot It fell nicely for him, but do you know what struck me there? Was his reaction as soon as he hit that ball his first thought was next action I need to get back into position and he did a 70 yard sprints from the right hand side of the field Back to his left back position. Yeah, that speaks volumes tells you all you need to know about brentford this brentford team Who are looking at taking four points from their first two matches That's a that's a great start after the way that they finished last season They were in a bit of trouble weren't they at one stage mcdomonate gives it to the left and molasia Now rashford's ball across the stretch back sorensen and then it's turned across the face of gold by ericsson I thought he'd hooked it in But he hooked it wide I did it just popped up nicely for ericsson didn't it was a little bit behind him He had to swing that left foot he got deflected the ball in from Rashford and he swung his left foot on the volley back across the goal And he just hooked it a little bit too wide as we just watch it in our monitor just sale Actually what ends up a couple of foot we had through the post but for a second there I was expecting the back of the net to bulge less than 10 minutes to go brentford full majesty united nil and uh United going to To make another change van der beek is just putting his shirt on so that will be number five won't it from majesty united Yep, that will be the final change van der beek, but I mean the game's long gone I bet he's delighted to be coming for the last night Oh, there's a foul by mcdomonate and now wish I placed it across who's going to play in toni mcdomonate could be in trouble here It's going to be a yellow card for the uh for the foul on onyeka Who I mean I think it is I think it is a yellow but brentford were away there But it was in the middle of the half he had options though But a yellow card it is from mcdomonate It was the same problems again The deep line midfield they're getting rolled the ball Trying to turn trying to play the ball around the corner getting closed down brentford robbing possession and immediately they're in at majesty united's back two or three. I mean When are this group? I mean they're such talented footballers When are they going to realize and stop making the same mistakes over and over again? It doesn't take eric ten hag As the manager of the ball to make them realize they know they're making the same mistakes over and over again at the moment That's it clen. You're absolutely right that you know the You look at the individual talent that there is on this page And you think it's unmatched from the brentford half. Yeah completely unmatched the talent in the majesty united squad Is second to none and you do think what is it with them that That none of the you know eric ten hag is at two matches so far all of the managers who've been in that position You know they've lost they've lost their jobs because they haven't been able to make it work Yeah to possibly motivate this group. I think it's I think we've got to stop looking at the majesty united managers because It's the same story regardless of the manager. So you've got to start looking at the players Freak it on. Jaqa has is still receiving treatment actually. I think he sort of rolled his ankle, didn't he? So mcdomony put in the challenge And his ankle buckled a little and he's on his feet. I mean he's a He's a formidable figure, isn't he? And I think there's yellow cut is that finandez? Is it something that's been said? I think I think he's been mourning just a little bit too much as as he quite often does So yellow card for finandez that's gone down. I think that's that's put the seal on it Hasn't it for the brentford supporters after the uh after the way that he's been So free kick janelle takes it scoops it into the area It's worked across to the neopiston put behind tony's attempted center molasia I mean even now four nil up six minutes remaining Brentford are still walking set pieces from the training ground. They're still thinking they're still being calm in the moment They're they're going through the process is what they know to do. Yeah Brentford leading four nil six oh six on the way with robbie savage and chris suiting to talk about this Another awful day from anchester united, but what a day for brentford. They'll be wanting brentford fans on to celebrate this Corner then from the right hand side lots of movement again But the this time it's headed away by ronaldo. Henry miss hits a shot into the penalty area still brentford attack And oh wonderful for work and the shot from the angle from janelle is carried away in behind Round the near post by de here excellent work from janelle. Yeah brilliant play from janelle They picked this ball up and he's just skipped past a couple of Manchester united players One go sliding past and then another checks backing onto his left foot and he Unleases a shot and i think he corner's taken quickly and the shot comes in from the edge of the penalty area from wissa De here got down well and carried it away It was cleared away in comes the next bolt of an ear post but that's scooped up by de here Yes, and it was the here who made the first save and then two more saves after that and All of a sudden he's busy and we say manches not you on the attack now. Yeah booze for christian ericsson five minutes to go four nil brentford Rashford in the box still going Uh the ball to the edge of the area ronaldo with the shot, but it's straight more or less straight after the Actually running field from a langer. It was to the edge of the penalty area Ronaldo with the shot, but it was curled straight into the chest of goalkeeper raya Yes, and as a langer was just making his way along that brentford eight in yaw box Fernandez almost tried to take the ball off him. I think he might have kicked the young man trying to shoot with goal One of those days glenn The problem from anxious united is that they've had far too many days like this Four nil at brighton at the end of last season new manager First away match of this season four nil at brentford. He has a langer now finandez Fernandez chips it over the top for a langer into the penalty area lovely little lift Pass to defender still a langer, but they are there in numbers brentford three of them forcing him away Fernandez ball in took a deflection stretch and clearance away from yansen Bruno Fernandez again on the right hand side long shadows now being cast by that hot sun Diego dallo into the penalty area Then he read that all afternoon and cleared it out of play near the halfway line So four nil it is and we'll see van der beek coming on now And it's going to be Christina ericsson is off And they're going to wave him goodbye Christina ericsson. They loved it when he was here last season But they were unhappy that he didn't stay And therefore that's why some brentford fans have budin But you can hear plenty of them here are applauding them as well in the stands too I should make that point I can actually see one or two of them having to go one another over that issue there because Well, I know it has been debated amongst brentford fans this week. Yeah, it has yeah And I for one are definitely on the ones that he needed to be applauded not Definitely not for the way he's played this afternoon But just because of what he done to this football club because I think at one point last season brentford looked like they could be possibly going to get into that tangle of going down but Like I said earlier that that that Partnership between him and tony and the understanding. I really feel fended the relegation fight off Yeah, there were seven wins in their last 11 games really lifted them completely out of danger and ericsson was at the heart of that So three minutes less than three minutes to go brentford four, manchester united nail plus added time There'll be plenty of that as well. Then it'll be six or six. We'll have the live interviews as well Don't don't miss those robbie and chris will be handing to john south all who'll be down talking to Eric ken haag and thomas frank. They'll be very different interviews those two won't they? Well, I think from the Oh poor ball from dallow has set brentford away on a counter attack and that's a foul by rashford coming back Conceding the free kick. I mean he had uh, he had so many options there That's a good foul by rashford by the way Baptiste could have gone through the middle right left with his pass but rashford brought him down yellow color We've we've talked about manchinite a lot in this game, but with two minutes to go rashford did show a little bit of something there coming back and burst Burstens neck to get back there and make a challenge and stop that brentford attack What do you think glenn with rashford? Paris Saint-Germain then in fact you can answer that in a moment because yannelt is going to play this free kick now out to the right hand side and uh whist that to baptiste brentford In possession way over there in that corner on the right and here's the cross which is That's got some adrenaline behind it that's pumped high over the penalty area and into the stand So go kick brentford who lead 4-0. So what do I think about the possibility of Mark's rashford leave manchist united? Well, yeah, would that be good for First of all, would that be good for the individual? Yes Yes, indeed I mean you've got I think you've got to accept that manch that rashford's a manchester boy Think he's a manchester united fan. So there's there's that side of it But I think when you look at it you only get a certain number of years playing this this beautiful game that we watch Week in week out And he wants to win things because he is such an exceptional talent and and is he going to win things? Looking at this afternoon's viewing Not quickly is not And then when we look at it from a manchester united point of view I think he's sort of the The jewel in the crown almost even though he hasn't produced it over the last year or so I still think he's one of the better ones at manchester united and the potential is still clearly there So from a club perspective, they will be desperate to keep him So that's marcus rashford glenn murray on marcus rashford One premier league striker on another four minutes of added time the ball is hoisted up in our direction Won't actually go off the field ben me is now putting it into the stands just down where we're left almost got a touch there glenn Four nil brentford lead were in added time four minutes of added time Well, I don't think we'll forget this afternoon in a hurry brentford fans certainly warned First first time you and I have done a commentary together So that is I think that could be a first for five lives by the way rinaldo thinks about a shot from 30 yards But then gives it to mcdominé and mcdominé plays it behind molasia And the ball rolls out of play for a throwing And that again a yet another example of Well that sums it up for manchester united today. I think I think plays is it's quite it's a nice term that john because he drilled that behind him didn't he Yeah, he did Yeah, I did I did hear chappers chatting earlier on the show and he said we have the brothers the murray brothers I mean, I think it's more a father and son act Yeah, that's that's a sad turn of events And not careful it might not be happening again I was thinking more of the fact that it was a cumbrian nor thumb brian A Combination you and me. I'm not sure we've had I'm not sure we've had one of those before In a commentary team on five lives, but I'm not sure the bbc have Well, let's let's not get too political after the week that we've had Here's van der beek it bounces off into Jan Elk and Jan Elk through over the halfway line Baptiste back to Jan Elk, but it's all a time for the brenford supporters surprised Some of them actually are Leaving early here. You'd think they'd want to be a partner. I mean not many just one or two I should say but you think they'd want to be part of hey jude after this inside this ground We did chat about that earlier, didn't we john and I remember the the the atmosphere against arson last year the opening game and the Liverpool game here and I was really blown away by the atmosphere but today it's I can't say it's been flat, but it's maybe been a little bit disappointing Well, maybe it's been too easy for brenford. Well that that is a point uh But wait for wait for hey jude after the match and thomas frank will take his players around You know, this is to be celebrated this whatever the state of manchester united to for brenford from where they were You know remember it's not too long ago That they spent a couple of seasons in the fourth tier And uh, you know had to make bookard collections to keep the club going Now look at them now. It just shows what a club ran properly can achieve though, doesn't it? Certainly does And here is goalkeeper raya Passing the ball out there henry brenford next weekend by the way one of the saturday three o'clock seal here on five live They are not too far away at fulham for west london darby fulham brenford so Brentford in possession with ben me And oh bruno finandez now is that a second yellow card was he booked earlier? I thought he was booked earlier john on the edge of the box He clearly wasn't so that is a yellow card for finandez, you know, he's just a little we thought he was didn't we early ron on the edge of the box We weren't a hundred percent sure so that confirms it So i'm sure stewart atwell didn't get that wrong So yellow card for finandez Just a minute or so to play before brenford can celebrate this this great win for them raya clears the ball away downfield david de here's got the ball in his hands If you weren't listening earlier david de here caught out badly a really poor mistake from him to concede the opening goal to de silber matthews jensen scored the second after christian erickson of all people was caught in possession The third came from a corner ben mees first goal for brenford and then brennan bermos scored on the breakaway to make it four Nail that was four nil inside 35 minutes That's the way that the scorers remained and brenford have won a free kick battees won a free kick after inside his own half And there it is There is the final whistle here at brenford's community stadium to herald a famous victory that equalled their record victory against Manchester united brenford's first win against Manchester united since before the second world war But the history for Manchester united is all bleak eric ten haag becomes the first Manchester united manager since 1921 To lose his first two matches in charge And united under his stewardship are left with no points from two matches Against breighton and brenford that is a horrible start for the new manager glenn murray Yeah, I mean starts don't get any worse than that as i'm just witnessing without the walk off and he doesn't look very happy at all He's having a little bit of words with I think it was steve mclaren as he walks off I mean it's just it does I think from the positive But he's just walked right past eric ten haag by the way he didn't shake his hand and eric ten haag also unmoved They didn't acknowledge each other but I mean I think I think from a Manchester united point of view It doesn't get any worse jump. What was that exchange with steve mclaren glenn? I didn't see that No, I missed it to be honest But every one of them spoken to steve mclaren as they walked off and not one player has even looked at eric ten haag Mind you if I put a performance in like that. I might not look at my manager either Wretched day for Manchester united They've been beaten four nil by brenford But a great day for thomas frank and his team and they are going to enjoy this moment in the sunshine here It really for brenford does not get too much better than this So that's it plenty to talk about. Thank you glenn murray for your company during the course of the afternoon Amazing afternoon an evening of football here, but it's finished brenford four Manchester united nil and it's time now to talk about this and everything else But this will be at the top of the bill. I'm sure robbie savage for you this evening It certainly will john. Thank you so much to yourself and glenn murray there watching brenford absolutely hammer Manchester united christ",
