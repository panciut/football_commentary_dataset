 Lewis and Gundawan, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Docku and Grealish coming into the side with top scorer, 18-goal Harland up front and Phil Forden and Matteo Kovacic on the bench. I think there's more of an eye on them for Sunday because for Manchester City it is two matches this week against two of the great clubs of Europe. Juventus tonight, here in Turin, and on Sunday the Manchester Derby. I hope you'll be with us for both of those matches on five live as the whistle goes. Listeners to Radio Manchester are with us as well. You can listen on the move on BBC Sounds, and it is Juventus in the black and white striped shirts, white shorts, white socks, who clear the ball out for a throw into Manchester City, who as we look from high up here on the dressing room side of the ground, are playing from right to left and will obviously keep you right across the Arsenal-Monaco match tonight as well, which is currently 12th against 13th in the table. So Arsenal also with work to do, like these two clubs, if they're going to finish in the top eight, and that means if you finish in the top eight, you will qualify automatically for the round of 16. As Manchester City have possession on the edge of their own penalty area, and Gavadiole turns it back to goalkeeper Ederson, who's back in after Ortega started the last three, but Pep Guardiola switching it around with the goalkeepers. Yeah, but they're good goalkeepers, and he accepts it, when we get a chance now and again, and he would be worried about that if you're a defender, actually, if you're a Manchester City fan, he's getting off. Here's Kevin De Bruyne on the right-hand side just presently. Bernardo Silva's there as well, it goes back to Kyle Walker, then Gundawan. And it is Gundawan and Lewis who are in the midfield roles, with Lewis dropping back into the back line, when Juventus have possession, but Kevin De Bruyne again on the right-hand side goes back into his own half. Douglas Louise is on the bench for Juventus tonight, as is Weston McKenney as well, the USA International, that you might remember being on loan at Leeds United, they're two of the Juventus players who are coming back from injury. But Nill, they're very early stages here, it's dry, it's very cold as well, and there is that alpine freshness in the air. With Manchester City doing exactly what Pep Guardiola asked them to do last night, when he was speaking to us, they are keeping it very simple, Pat. Yeah, they are. Not taking any chances with the passes just now, Bernardo Silva is the first player to try and take anyone on. But you're right, the pivotal player is Rico Lewis. He started with the possession at the left-back, he's not actually been there since the first 10 seconds of the game, they've moved into that centre-midfield position, and that is how he does that in that position, because it's so important to Manchester City, because that player controls how much you hold the ball. Rico Lewis will be suspended after being sent off at Salos Park, De Bruyne and now with a cross, deep from the right-hand side, but goalkeeper Di Gregorio can come and catch that high up above Harland. And the other thing as well is, Pat, you know, has sort of blithely mentioned that Grealish would be on one side and Docu on the other, but Grealish, I mean, it's not really a number 10 role, is it? It's a left-sided midfield role. Yeah, but at Bellum's, the double 10, De Bruyne will be one side, I think that Grealish will be the other side of Harland, and there's kind of half-positions in the plate all over the place there. Which looks great, we're in a positive position in the home, but there are weaknesses to that, and I would say Closley Sal, who's on the right-hand side here, he's going to be a lot of space, if he can get the ball one-on-one against Guardio, that's something that he'll look forward to. That's Pat Nevin with us for the commentary, Scotland International twice Chelsea player of the year, and looking down at the winger here on the left-hand side for Manchester City, Docu, who is all on his own, way out wide on the left wing, I don't think he's had a touch of the ball yet, because it's all been on the right-hand side for Manchester City, and it's there again with Bernardo Silva, comes back to de Gundewan, Manchester City's Champions League-winning captain, to the now-club captain, Kyle Walker, then forward again to Rico Lewis, passes it back, Juventus just can't get a touch of the ball, Benfica are winning one-nil against Bologna, that is the first goal of the night in the eight-o-clock kick-offs, with Benfica one-nil up, Manchester City with the ball on the right-hand side, with Bernardo Silva bears a touch to knock it out of play from Kenan Yildiz, and it's a throw-in to Manchester City. Kipping you across all of the matches in the championship tonight, still winning for the first goal of the evening, and the choice of listening tonight, the sports extra, option is the T20, and that goes beyond the Benfica, goes beyond, so it's back to nil-nil between those two. So nil-nil, here in Turin, completely enclosed stadium, the stadium that was built to replace the old Stadio della Alpi, you must have come here, Pat, to the old della Alpi, with that big track around, it felt as though you were miles and miles away from the action. This new stadium brilliantly rebuilt with all of the white metalwork above our heads, everyone has got a great view and is close to the action, as it comes up to Docky on the halfway line, Docky was being took back there by Gatti, and it's a free kick on the halfway line, given by Clement Terpan, the French referee. Yeah, the atmosphere has not changed a great deal, no matter what the stadium looks like. The fans have been fantastic all the way from the start of this game, and considering the difficult run they've been having, they're absolutely up for these fans. But the thing is, the team kind of got kicked, the ball just now, and Manseter tried to close them down high up the field, this is important to see if they're capable of doing it. That was brave from D. Gregorio, the goalkeeper, passing it between De Bruyne and Grealish. He had to get that absolutely right to Locatelli, but he did. And now finally, the Bianconeri have got possession of the ball, and you can hear the reaction from the crowd, as the ball is played through to Flavage, might have been offside. Still Flavage takes it out towards the left and shoots it, deflected behind it, then the offside flag goes up, and you can hear the reaction from the popular end to our right. Yeah, we had not been too clever, we were dead on line without it. You could see that it had gone offside, you're going far, I would say far too early, but a little bit too early. I mean, it is an intriguing way that it's been set up, Manseter said just now, and it's going to take a little while for Juventus to figure out what Stronan and where the spaces are. You can see they're used to that, they're comfortable with that, and Flavage and Yildiz hasn't got on the ball yet, these are very, very special players, and he'll be desperate for a chance to have a goalkeeper. So this is Champions League commentary last night, we brought your commentary from inside the stadiums in Spain and Germany. Tonight we're in Italy, tomorrow night Europa League, don't miss that, from Ibrox, we'll be inside the stadium, not sure you're getting that anywhere else, and it is nil-nil here. We're also keeping across the matches in the women's Champions League, where Chelsea have taken the lead against 20, Catarina Macario with the goal for Chelsea, Celtic playing Real Madrid in the women's Champions League tonight. De Bruyne, five yards inside the Juventus heart, very much hooking the far touch line, and then Walker gives it back to Kevin De Bruyne, and De Bruyne flips it forward towards Harland on the edge of the area, tried to give it back to De Bruyne, too many black and white shirts in there, and then it's run away by Yildiz, who's actually forced to run it all the way back into his own full-back position, where De Nilo passes it forward to Touram, another of the sons of the great Lillian Touram, the French international World Cup winner. De Bruyne now tries to, and I think he might have been pulled back there by Gatti, but referee who was right there said no, De Bruyne went to ground, there weren't too many complaints from De Bruyne, and he went back with it. He lost control of the ball, it was a pullback, but he'd lost control of the ball, and he wasn't going to get it there, with that heart showing on, but you know, a referee, that's how he understood how it was going to play. Really intriguing to see, UV, they think they can play through this city team, they think this high-press ain't going to work, they don't think Manchester City have the energy to keep it up, very intriguing to see that they're wanting to do that, and almost drawing Manchester City up the field to try. So it's still 0-0 here, and neither goalkeeper has had a save to make. By the way, five lives, Champions League Final Score is in operation tonight, so you can listen to our commentary alongside the Final Score graphics and the video printer. If you go to the red button on your television, the iPlayer as well, you can click on Champions League Final Score and do that. So, 0-0 here in the early stages, how have things started at Arsenal? Arsenal 0-0, Milooslaviskeli only recently turned 18, Younger's player to start a Champions League game for Arsenal in over 13 years. He's begun ostensibly at left back, but as fullbacks do these days, he's creeping into midfield. Gabriel Jesus is at the first big chance of the evening, it's Arsenal 0-0. Thank you, Conor, and it is Conor who will be at Ibrox tomorrow night with James McFadden for the Rangers Tottenham commentary. That's it, that's a massive match, and here you've entered on the attack pad and they've won a corner. Well, I was going to talk at the start of the tour, we didn't have enough time to lead the chat, but we talked about the big match-ups in this game, you know, big players playing against each other. There's a very small match-up down there, isn't it? Conce Sal is playing against Rico Luz, and that's the first time he's had a run-up, and Luz lost him there. He's going down and injured himself there, Conce Sal. Now, to be fair, Conce Sal goes down a lot. I mean, he seems to have an inner-ear problem every time you see him play. Actually, in this thing, I think he's injured himself, he's not been kicked. I think he has actually injured himself. Well, they are... Look at that, I can see that. The spray that he's being administered to is... Dry-ice! It's like disco time. Let's hope he's OK. I know exactly what you mean. I saw him play last season for Porto in the Champions League. He's been out of the pitch, and we'll see if he's able to come back on. In the Champions League, Fiannaud are winning 1-0 against Sparta Braga, it was Fiannaud who had that comeback against Manchester City in their last match from 3-0 down. And also, trumpet playing, it is 1-0 to Young Boys, they're winning 1-0 against Stuttgart, having yet to win a point in the Champions League. Here is the corner, which is taken deep, deep to the back post by Coupe Minas, headed away by Lewis. There was no-one there for Juventus, but Lewis is headed out of play and has conceded how to come back on. Yes, he has. He's back on the field, so he looks as though he's all right. That spray has done its worth, perhaps. Yeah. The corner kick, we're so used to the real artists of the corner kick, getting it right, the likes of Arsenal and Stuttgart. A viewer. Very good. And as Nill, Manchester City, Nill, and the balls out of play for a throw-in-two city on the far side with Kyle Walker. And the cry of Juve, Juve comes up from the stand to our right, where all manner of flags, of varying messages and crests and flags are being waved all the way up and down the middle of that stand. Throw-in for Manchester City, which is deflected out of play for a throw-in-two Juventus. So back Juventus go to the centre of defence and all the way back to goalkeeper D. Gregorio. An opening goal of the night in the championship at the Hawthorns in the 8 o'clock kick-off, Sanirudh Ravajala. 12-gone West Bromwich Albion 1, Coventry City, Nill, Tom Fellow is driving into the box, his shot was, his work was cleared, only to Alex Moer on the edge of the area who's hammered it home. West Bromwich Albion 1, Coventry City, Nill. In the Champions League, Feyenoord now 2-0 up on Sparta Prague. Another of our featured matches in the championship. Is it the den, Aaron Paul? Nill Sheffield United. Now how Sheffield United are not ahead, I do not know. We saw an attempt from Gustavo Haimer cross the box, and then, John, we've seen four or five cross-cum shots all evade the goal line of Lucas Jensen, baffling stuff from Sheffield United. They've definitely been in control in these opening phases, but atmosphere conversational here at the den, very, very flat, following that news of Nill Harris's departure after the weekend's fixture. 27-gone Millwell Nill, Sheffield United now. Yes, his last home match in charge. Manchester City with the ball just outside the Juventus box. Lewis found Jack Grealish on the edge of the area, just lost possession, but Sidney have got it back. Gavadial swings the pass to his left to Dockoo, and then Lewis and Gavadial again, as Grealish is after it, but it's going to be taken back down there by Gatti, who turns, finds the pass away. Lewis, though, is able to get up and head it forward. Dockoo is, I think, caught there. He was the defender, the young right-back Savona was looking at clearing away, and it was just touched away from him by Dockoo. He was already through with his kick and caught the Manchester City player for a free kick. Yeah, he stood in the back of his foot there. No shock news, Constance was always back down in his backside again. Honestly, the guy should have been a warram. He's always timing the ground. Anyway, so, you know, I've got a chance here. The player such as De Bruyne and Dockoo, Grealish, they haven't really got on the ball that much in the final third, but gaps will open up. It's just seeing if they can do something with it. Savona takes this free kick, actually takes it down the line to Dockoo, could have delivered it into the area. Here is the delivery to the near post, headed away by two-ram. Grealish with the volley square on the edge of the box, over there to the right, Bernardo Silva, and then it comes back to Gundawan, who is very much a part of this Manchester City team. This is his 14th start in the last 16 matches. I'm not sure that was necessarily the plan when he was brought back to Manchester City at the age of 34, but needs must be exactly. There were a number of players that he was seeing his back up for when he brought him back in, but he absolutely has to be in there. But as I say, Rico, though, is actually probably the more important one in that central area, just trying to play through him. And he's getting all out of the ball, but he's had maybe one forward pass in the game so far. Do you think that, Rodri, position is easy? It isn't. No, as they are very obviously demonstrating. Juventus nil, Manchester City nil, still Arsenal nil, Monaco nil, and the ball has found its way back to Edison, who in the absence of Allyson, with his injury, Edison has been the Brazilian first choice for the last four World Cup qualifiers. Back in goal tonight, with City playing the ball out from the back, and Gundawan under pressure, finding Diaz, and Walker in the end has to hit the long pass, which is deflected out for throwing to Manchester City. Manchester City, they're almost asking Manchester City to play it out from the back, saying, we actually think we can do you there. And they feel as if Manchester City had the really well before. They're giving them no time at all when they're close to going up the pitch there, and that's twice as nearly quite city. However, this time, City have got it. 15 minutes played, and really not too much to right home about so far, as Dooku goes on a weaving run and was just sort of balked there as he took it past Coop Minor, so that's a free kick, middle of the half, over towards this left-hand side. It's a vibrant atmosphere, as it always is here. The Amanda supporters, whenever you come to Italy, they are so passionate, aren't they? I mean, when they opened the doors, what was it like? There was a sprint to get in. My guys, there's two hours and girls. Walking, running down the steps, getting their places with their tight black jackets on. They all seem to wear tight black jackets, don't they? Or the majority? Free kick then for De Bruyne. De Bruyne, Harlan just takes up a position outside the six-yard box, makes himself very obvious. De Bruyne plays it in, it's headed up and away by Turam, then further away by Consisau, but only giving possession back to the marooned shirts of Manchester City and Kyle Walker in the centre circle. If you're going to watch the highlights tonight on Champions League Match of the Day, which is on after the news, you won't see much of the first 15 minutes of this match. No, they've just been testing each other out, seeing where everyone's playing, where's my man, who do I mark. When we've got the ball, where's the space going to be? But as the classic came of chess, as they try to figure each other's weaknesses out and so forth. That chess was very apt since we're watching the black and white of Juventus and Manchester City get the ball down on the halfway line. So remember, both of these sides, they have got eight points in the group coming into these matches in what UEFA call Match Day 6. So if there's a loser tonight, I mean, you're quite convinced that whoever loses, that's excellent play by Bernardo Silva on the edge of the area into the box, but his attempted cross was blocked by Danilo, who almost went down onto one knee, the long barrier to put it behind for a corner there first to Manchester City. Yeah, I think the loser tonight is so little chance of getting to the direct qualification. And I actually think either team, you know, if even if they draw, I think it's a real struggle for them. I think on the top of their minds is one thing that Peguardio said, one at a time, is actually getting through to the next round, even if it's qualifying. Yeah, so it's a corner then to Manchester City. Harland is being manhandled in it comes looking for Harland, he was stretching for it. I think the defender still had his arms around Harland, but wasn't able to get a clear head to it. Juventus played back from Locatelli, and then long from goalkeeper Di Gregorio, but Kyle Walker inside his own heart was able to turn it back to the City goalkeeper. I thought it's not been hugely exciting. You look at the technical side of the game just now, no players have got any space, and very rarely does a forward player get a one-on-one, an individual one-on-one in the last third against any of the defenders on both sides. It tells you most managers know what they're doing, most coaches know exactly what they're doing, but it's all about concentration, because eventually at some point a gap will open up, and it's to see who's capable of making good use of that gap. Manchester City with the ball in Juventus territory. Walker goes for a high, Crossfield pass, but Savona is underneath that, and is able to then get it back from Conce São, and then infield to Locatelli, and Juventus played across their back line, and over there towards the left-hand side, where Danilo will play it back into the six-yard box, as he is at the best of terrible press, as awful. Harland running right across him, and therefore De Gregorio is able to find the pass through Savona, and Savona now attacking the penalty area using Conce São to the right. City have got two men on him, Lewis and Docky. Back it goes from Conce São to Locatelli. Locatelli's aerial ball into the area is headed away by Cavadio, but it comes out to Juventus again, and this is a danger as the shot flashes across the face of goal from Yildiz, and given the angle that was probably the best part of 25 yards. Edison leaping to his left, but it bounced wide. Doing that's the first real chance we've had to see Yildiz. Just moments ago, I'm seeing there's very few times any player's got the chance of a one-on-one in the final third. Well, they've a little bit of a chance here, just a tiny little bit of an opening. Giver may be hard to cover, but you know it looked as if it's just about on target, but it's just swung away inches at the last moment. And the decision-winner's a lot of half a chance, actually, Stans. But something happened down the right-hand side there, Savona and Conce São. Conce São did the underlap there, had the bat of space, and then stopped. Do yourself a favour, Savona, keep on moving. It was an absolute disgrace to him. Unprofessional piece of play by Savona. You've got to work with Dwellas in front of you, not turn round to the crowd and say you've done something wrong. Savona still relatively inexperienced. He is 21, but this is his first season in the first team on stages like this. Juventus nil, Manchester City nil. Still Arsenal nil, Monaco nil. We'll be making regular visits there. Manchester City, there is a little bit of tension in the Alpine air here. Manchester City, who in the groups in recent seasons, has been relatively plain sailing. And I think that is one of the beauties. I think regular listeners will know I'm not completely sold on this new extended league phase of the Champions League, but Manchester City last season won all six group matches in the second season in a row, they finished top of that group. This is a very different challenge. Champions League is a very different Manchester City as well. That would be true also. But come back to a moment ago, there was a half chance there, it wasn't a foul U of A. It's because of that press that Manchester City tried to put on. And I was saying, U of A don't believe they're good enough to do it. And it was played through them much, much too easy. And left five Manchester City players completely in atelier for dead. So, the treaty is here, Manchester City, try that high press again. Nice ball forward from Gundawan to De Bruyne. And then Harlan cancels with Danilo on the half-way line, a flick in field. But that was read by Gundawan, who was left on his backside on the ground. Ball finds its way to Conce Sáu here, on the right flank for Juventus. Conce Sáu, Grealish and Lewis with him. He's found the ball across in between the two Manchester City men, but Bernardo Silva was back there to whip it away with his left foot. They're having a few good moments now, they're two wingers for Juventus. He certainly felt that before the game, if you can stop those two players playing, it stops a lot of the things that Juventus are capable of doing. By the way, they're playing just now, but that's offside. Offside against Coop Miners, who swung the ball all back from the left-hand side, but it was offside. Free kick taken quickly by Manchester City. Grealish is off and running, hair flowing as he does so. He's halfway inside the Juventus half, then gives it to his left, to De Bruyne. Now here is Jeremy Docku against the young man, the young right back, Savona. Chakes him on, but then Conce Sáu is handed off by Docku. And then as the ball is passed away, there's a little arm out from Conce Sáu to Docku. Nothing a force, but I don't think Conce Sáu is impressed by that. Manchester City have it with Gundawan and then Grealish back to Gundawan again, who just rolls the ball to his right to Ruben Diaz, who was extremely talkative last night. Wasn't he Ruben Diaz? Really nice to hear somebody talking. Here's De Bruyne now on the edge of the area, back to Bernardo Silva. Up comes the cross to the back post, it's bounced all the way to Docku. He gets it down, the area packed with defenders. Docku's ball across is cleared away on the edge of the six-yard box by Gatti. And it's actually kept in by Conce Sáu, to keep it in. Good for Docku. Yeah, but I was going to say that a moment ago there, that Docku had a chance to run his defender before that and didn't do it. Well, a few seconds left, he did do it and it got to the ball in very easily. Here's Kup Minas, the former Atalanta man who left the club after winning the Europa League last season. But he was unable to find the pass that he needed to Vlahavic. And now Manchester City have it on the left-hand side with Docku, takes on Savonar again and then plays it through delightfully to De Bruyne, whose ball couldn't find Harland, cleared away. And then as Bernardo Silva comes in, the defender just got to it first and Juventus are able to bring it away. I can tell you that England won by six wickets against South Africa to take the series against South Africa 2-1. So they'll be wrapping things up right now on Sports Extra. But it is Juventus, Nail, Manchester City, Nail. And let's get another update from Conor McNamara back in London. Arsenal, Nail, Monaco, Nail, first scare for Arsenal, Kivio lost it cheaply on the edge of his own area. Alexander Gullivan pounced, lashing a shot that was only marginally up-target. Down the other end, Odegard has come close for Arsenal. We are 23, almost 24 minutes in. Arsenal have not had a corner yet. They're appealing for one now, but they're not going to get it. Monaco have done their homework. They're not going to give our tennis team that opportunity. Arsenal, Nail, Monaco, Nail. Thank you, Conor. Arsenal are currently down in 12th place and Monaco in 13th in the live table. If you're going to a match on the final night of the Champions League, you're going to need to make sure you've got very good connectivity so you know what's going on. It might be worth listening to us as long as we've got good connectivity on the last night of the Champions League. Very intriguing. We're talking about 15 minutes, not a great deal of harming. Then it just suddenly broke out there, didn't it? We've had seven or eight minutes, it's been much, much more often. Players have been getting into space there. The Browns have found a lot of pockets. He's been looking for 15 minutes to see where those pockets of space are. Now Doc is getting involved a little bit and the game has stretched a little bit more than it had before. Gavardi all approaches the halfway line. Gavardi Grilish has dropped all the way back there as well. And then in the centre circle, Ruben Bias rolls it out to the right-hand side. Bernardo Silva is there, comes back to Kyle Walker. Walker uses Rico Lewis as a little look over his shoulder, all of that black hair of his. Bobbing, Rico Lewis. Now past his teenage years, he's 20 now, the England international. Docu on the left goes to the byline, but I think he overran it before he got the cross and he did. And it was a goal kick to Juventus. We have not yet had an attempt on goal from Manchester City. Just that one attempt at the other end, the shot from Yildiz, which bounced wide at the Manchester City goal. A couple of teams have tried to put crosses in there, but not a huge amount. And once again, we were trying to draw them in a little bit, but Manchester City have got it again. In the championship, goal at Millwall, Aaron Paul. Four minutes to the break, Millwall-Nill, Sheffield United won it, and after a hat-trick of Millwall chances, Sheffield United break the deadlock. Gustavo Harmer played in off the right, gorgeous ball through, and he spotted Rian Brewster with the run at the far post. The ball evading everyone, and it was easy for Brewster just tap-home to make it. Millwall-Nill, sorry, Sheffield United won. Sheffield United coming into that on an eight-match unbeaten run, really pushing for a return to the Premier League this season. I think under Chris Wilder, one would expect that they will sustain that this season. Here is Coopminers. He's given it away, there's a little slip there from Yildiz. Not as bad as Cucarera at the weekend, but it didn't help him. Manchester City back in possession. Actually, that was Coopminers' mistake there. They should pass through the feet there and the players running towards you. Again, they constantly played through that little press at Manchester City, tried to put it on, and it was very noticeable. Teams in the past never believed that they could get through that press. You'd be like, hey, how could we do that? There's not enough energy to get close to us. Stuttgart have pegged it back against Young Boys. Stuttgart won, Young Boys won. Lewis back to Grealish. Grealish then played all the way back to Cavadio. Yes, Ruben Diaz, when he was speaking to us last night, actually used the phrase, back to basics, which Stephen Warnock, who was on the programme on Five Live earlier, said it's an old footballing phrase. I remember it as an old political phrase. Do you remember John Major talking about back to basics? It certainly was in football in Mexico many, many years before that as well, because you're having a bad time playing simple passes. Everyone's taught at a very early age, and getting yourself back into the game, getting back into competence when you're losing it. And the spirit of our players, that Manchester City, said, can you do that? I think Ruben Diaz knows a lot. I'm not sure he knows about John Major. Dooku bringing the ball in field, but it went down. No free kick. And now, here, turning dangerously as Yildiz, who slips the ball forward to Glavich. The angle is tight, he works it back across goal, but dribbles into the six-yard box, where Edison's able to pick it up. Gorgeous little flash from Yildiz there, wasn't it? He's got a dummy, he's got Gundum on him. He's just done him, and there was no way in the world that Gundum was going to catch him. Absolutely not a chance in the world there. That was through ball, looking for Glavich. Couldn't quite get it under control. That's an interesting one. From young Kenan Yildiz, the 19-year-old, who plays on the left-hand side going forward, but there, he was in a central position, and they say that's where they want to see him. Oh, absolutely, that's where he's going to end up. You can tell with the type of play he has, but as John, he's understanding the game, he's been around already in Germany, but what a special talent. Done two things so far in this game, probably two of the best things we've seen so far. Yeah, Turkish international, you'll remember him probably from the Euros, and as Pat suggested, German Bohn, one of the German Bohn, Turkish contingent, just like Ilgay Gunduan on the other side. But it was by a Munich youngster before he came to the Juventus Academy, so that is Kenan Yildiz. Juventus, Manchester City, nearly half an hour played. The Juventus fans wrapped up against the cold here, bouncing up and down, which is probably quite a wise thing to do. You wouldn't know it if you've just switched on. You might think Juventus have a comfortable lead, but we've seen not too much so far in the match to jump up and down about. So what about Arsenal, Monaco, Cunham McNamara? Arsenal, Monaco, two big chances to report for Gabriel J. Zouce, though two good saves, the first one especially. The Brazilian can drink through a hoof-long ball, suddenly he's one-on-one with Mijecke in the Monaco goal. The keeper pulls off this remarkable save, 99 times out of 100. Gabriel J. Zouce scores that. Big lead off for Monaco. Arsenal, Monaco, Nill. It is Chelsea 1-20-1 in the Women's Champions League, and Manchester City, good possession just outside the man. The Juventus penalty area, Bernardo Silva through to Walker. Walker's got some space, if he can pull it back, but there were three, four Juventus players in the path of that pullback, and they were able to clear it. And Conce Sao's going to do well with this ball, which is played behind him. He does actually keep it in, just in front of where Thiago Mota is standing in his first season as the Juventus coach after excellent work at Bologna in the last two seasons. He's got Bologna into the Champions League. They are playing tonight, they are struggling, they've got work to do to avoid elimination, and they are currently 0-0 with Benfica. They were here on Saturday, of course, Bologna. We're winning 2-0 before Juventus came back to make it 2-2, their fourth draw in a row. Now here is Hildes on the left-hand side, into the penalty area. This is dangerous, excellent block though. Still in the box, Diaz was able to get his body in front of that shot, but fine work by Hildes. Yeah, as I say, the best things that have happened in this game so far have been from Hildes. He gets the ball on the left-hand side there. It's 1-0 on 1 with Walker. He just cruises past him. He doesn't have to do it in special. He just cruises beyond Kyle Walker there. And it's such an unusual thing. See from Kyle Walker, the possibility of a hand ball, they might have been looking at there, but... I think the flag might have been up there. It was before, yeah. Although, he's saying that, it's a goal kick. Yeah, it was a very, very tight one, but when the shot was that, it did hit off a Manchester City arm, but it was under the limit, it was close, and it was not in a strange position. 0-0 here in Turin, still 0-0 at the Emirates. And it is half-time now at Millwall, Aaron Paul. Millwall 0-0, Sheffield United 1, Rian Brewster's first goal in 27 months, separates the two sides, but it's been a pretty balanced affair. The visitors have controlled possession, but Millwall had the better of the chances. Tanganga and Savile hit the post. Aziz has forced a good save from Michael Cooper, but it's a tap-in finish created by Gustavo Harmer. And finished by Rian Brewster, that's the difference of the break. Millwall 0-0, Sheffield United 1. You enter us on the attack. Turin has misplaced that quite badly. Past it. I'm not sure he was anticipating the run of Yildiz. It just didn't come, and it was probably 25 yards ahead of him and out of play for a throw-in. I think maybe Trego to Vyovic and play with the outside, he's right foot, problem is, played it with N-80s foot. Wrong side of foot, exactly. Issue. I mentioned Chelsea 1-21 in the Women's Champions League. It is now Celtic-Nil Real Madrid 1, and Chelsea are back in front. Rian Jean-François making it Chelsea 2-21, if that makes sense. To me, it wasn't that. To me, numbers in that. Here is Lewis, the referee blocks Coop Miners, and then blows his whistle, and makes out that he got winded by Coop Miners. And I think that might have been a... He's had the technology, which has then jammed into his back. Yeah, but also because of that collision, Manchester City were away on the attack there. They had to stop it. Probably a wise move. Yeah, no, I had to stop that. The ball wasn't touched by the referee, but it was a massive interference in the play. The new favour on the ball there, so it was the right thing to do to stop it. So half-time at Millwall, running through the half-times in the other 7.45 kick-offs in the championship. Not many goals around in the five matches. Still Cardiff Nill, Preston Nill, Hull City Nill, Watford Nill, in what is Ruben Sellers' first match as the manager. The other scores in the moment, but first to Arsenal because... Arsenal have taken the lead, 12 minutes ahead of half-time. Bukai Osaka was there to finish. The cross came from Gabriel Jézus, but this was all created by 18-year-old Miles Lewis-Skelly. Drop to shoulder, beat a defender, played the through ball for Gabriel Jézus, and Arsenal take the lead against Monaco. So Arsenal are in front, and it's Bukai Osaka on the mark again. The other half-time score in the championship, it is QPR Nill, Oxford Nill, both of the struggleers in the championship. I love QPR showing some form recently, and as we heard from Aaron Millwall, Nill, Sheffield United. One Nill-Nill here in Turin, where in terms of thrills and spells, it's been a little disappointing. It's a wee bit disappointing, but it's an interesting game, tactically. None of the man-side players really have shown and done anything special. Again, that kind of tiredness, that slight uncertainty, that slight lack of spark and belief in playing the ball forward at a moment's notice. You don't get a lot of time. Very special passes, only one for a millisecond. You don't have time to think, oh, should we take that chance? You've got to take it. Not really doing it, just too concentrated on making sure they do the simple thing, which is exactly what Pep asked him to do. Arsenal with Lewis, middle of the eventous half. Lifts a pass out to Dockoo on the left. Dockoo back to Lewis, who makes himself available, turns, and then Gundawan, Dubriona, 23 yards out, Dubriona, one touch, then a second touch to Bernardo Silva, back to Dubriona. In comes the ball, looking for Harlott, comes back to Harlott, via a deflection off a defender. Then he went for a snapshot, but he didn't really get any power behind it. A goalkeeper, D. Gregorio has it again. And it gives you the story of what you know can happen for Manchester City. You get with Dubriona, very little involved in the game. Two or three times he's got the ball, in decent crossing positions. He's put an OK ball in, but you see Dubriona is best. He doesn't put an OK ball in there. He puts a vicious one in there. It's almost impossible to defend, and it's not quite spanking for the other, Dubriona, Dubriona, yet. So it is 0-0. By the way, that Pukajosaka goal in the live Champions League table has taken Arsenal back up into the top eight, where you would qualify directly for the round of 16. So Arsenal currently fifth in that live table. Lewis, then Grealish. He has Harlan from the angle, crosses, via deflection, and then two rounds in position to chest it back to his goalkeeper. And then, out, come you've entered, but Manchester City have got possession back again. It's good to see Grealish doing what Grealish did there. When you go out the ball in that position, you know, one of the two 10s behind Harlan, but he's facing forward, and the amount of times that Grealish gets the ball, and his first movement is back towards his own goal. That team's first movement is towards the opposition goal. It looks a different player. He looks so much better. He looks like the player he wasn't asking for. So much, much better from Grealish there. Chelsea now three-one up on 20 in the Women's Champions League group, from which they have already qualified. Maya Ramirez with the third goal, still Celtic nil, Real Madrid one, and Manchester City have got possession back. They've absolutely dominated the possession in the old style of Manchester City, if we can put it in those terms. As it's played forward to Harlan, Harlan with the flick out to the far side, but Dignilore has got that comfortably back. The veteran as he is now, Brazilian international, forward it goes to Kupnikers. Then Vlavač comes out of the penalty area. His challenge goes down, gets back up, Lokatelli at the yield is. Now he has two ram, and the outside flag is up against Gieltis, which is a little careless. It's a bit of a shame that because this one better moves that they've had in the game. Gielta is getting on the ball in that far side there. Yeah, I see Manchester City, they have got a lot of possession, but the best in Manchester City, they have possession almost like a basketball court round the 18 yard line in the opposition. It's not kind of being like that, has it? I mean, they've got some good possession, but they have a lot of possession with a lot of your teams. But a lot of team is preying, so, you know, Anadain, midfield stuff, isn't it? It is. Juventus nil, Manchester City nil, Arsenal winning 1-0, to the sacca goal, Guardiol steps forward and heads it down for Docky. Here is Grealich, who's for the moment, on the left-hand side, he's challenged by Constiçao, went down quite theatrically. Play continues, Harlan now in from DiBairno, and the goalkeeper flung up an arm and made a very decent save, actually. Tried to dink it over him, and Di Gregorio was able to make a reaction save. The goal was a big mess, though, but I don't know if it is a big mess. I think he did everything right, he's checked the goalkeeper, he's just got a big talk, then saved it. Manchester City's biggest chance so far, still 0-0, Constiçao now down the other end. Suddenly, it's turning more dramatic, as Danilo tries a shot against this old club with 25 yards, but with that shot, it was easy for Edison just to take a step to his left and grab it into his chest. But by some distance, the best opportunity of the game there, from Harlan, I should be really impressed by Harlan's movement in the game, probably the best movement of any Manchester City player. He's not getting the ball very often, but he's always getting in the position. Twice he's managed to get there, this time he got it. Tried to flick the keeper, and I think he's really unlucky. I've put that down at great stage. So Juventus, Niel, Manchester City now back to Arsenal, Conor McNamara. Still Arsenal, one, Monaco, 0-0, it should be 2-0, though Martin Odegaard bouncing on a defensive error, through 1-1 with the goalkeeper, agonisingly for Arsenal, put it wide. It's Prokajosakos' goal that separates them. Arsenal, one, Monaco, 0-0. Another goal for Chelsea's women, Aaron Cuthbert, 4-1, nearly 20, as Juventus bring the ball away and Constiçao flicks it out of Dooku. Thiago Mota comes forward. Oh, did he? Yeah, and Thiago Mota actually almost stepped onto the pitch there to slap him on the back. Constiçao, you know, it wouldn't surprise me at all if he's the kind of young player who needs encouragement. And that's what he's got from his manager there. Absolutely, because it's one of those things, you can get inside his head, the thing about Constiçao, there is a lot of talent there. There's a massive amount of talent. There's a good deal of speed as well. 1-1 with defenders, he's fabulous, but he has to keep his head right. Yes, and as I said, Challenge is Dooku, that's a foul. It's a free kick from Manchester City. And actually, the two of them have stood up and have squared up, not aggressively, it's just a sort of posturing. Referee Turpan has gone in between them, and they're still speaking to one another, even though the referee is there, they're a team mate as well. And then the burner just walks between them, Loca Telly is involved also. And let's see whether the referee does actually take any action against the two players. Um, this is made to do so much out to them. Wingers, honestly. Handbats. Nothing going on there. I think when it was, it was a rubbish tackle, really, but Constiçao. They're funny sorts, aren't they, Wingers? Yeah, I never trust them. Not to be trusted. And they can't tackle either. No, famously. And that's it. Well, I must say, if, um... Francisco Constiçao is anything like his dad, Sergio, the former coach of Porto, who always used to have plenty to say for himself. Yes, I think he has got work to say for himself. Yeah, he is. He is something like his father. Currently not in work, but I'm sure we'll see you again soon. Halftime approaching here after half a few chances, but Manchester City with a set-piece opportunity. Still 0-0. De Bruyne into the near post, and across comes two-around. And amongst two other Juventus players there, it's another corner, another set-piece. It's not great though, is it? I mean, that, you know, De Bruyne is one of the best we've ever seen in the Premier League in delivery. And the deliveries have been kind of a bit flocking, you know, just kind of dinked in there. You need to whip them in there. You need to put it in and ask a defender a question. It's a good thing, you know, that they're going to give you the attack or something, the attack. But they've kind of been dogged in there a little bit, so something to do a little bit better from this corner, Kevin. Floppy, like Ian Dennis, with his floppy disc that he was talking to us about on the commentators' view podcast a couple of weeks ago, which you can get on BBC Sound. De Bruyne takes it into the near post, and it's headed away for Juventus. Further away from Considio, which is down into the ground, and Juventus are able to clear, and it's all the way back to Edison at the other end. So Juventus, Nail Manchester City, Nail 5 Live from the BBC, BBC Manchester as well. And of course, all live BBC Radio can be listened to via BBC Sounds via the app, which is free. It can take us wherever you go, and indeed you can pause, rewind the action, listen back to our commentaries if you've been at any of the matches. I'm not sure I'd necessarily recommend you listen back to the first half of this. There is Nail Nail. There is no commentaries, OK, John? Well, I don't think that's for us to be the judge of. So it's Nail Nail here. Back to Conor at Arsenal. Well, still Arsenal lead by Colton Hill, but remarkable that they haven't extended this lead. They've had by far the most chances. The latest from Martin Hill, one-on-one puts it. Why do the post again? Arsenal won one at Gunnell. Actually, Conat is going to be on this week's The Commentators View podcast. Edison, long downfield from one end, that rather sums it up, from one goalkeeper to the other goalkeeper, D. Gregorio, at the other end, who I think has probably produced the moment of the first half with that save from Harlan. Locatelli, then two-round. Now, Flavec in the centre-circle. Flavec goes almost to full 360 degrees, so Krupp Meiners is furthest forward. Now, here's Konce Sauer again, just in front of where Pep Guardiola is watching in an extremely padded black coat. Now, Danilo drops back into the defence and Juventus have got it inside their own half, and we'll see the fourth official very shortly coming forward to show us how much time there will be. It's got to be one. It's got to be one minute, surely. Nothing's happened. And as I've said that, John, one minute of added time before we can get back into that bag that Juventus have supplied for us to see what's in it. Here is Turam, now to Danilo. And then frustration from the Juventus supporters. I think this was the case here for the match on Saturday when they were 2-0 down. The home crowd were booing Juventus, and now they're urging Turam to do something with this. But again, he's closed down, centre-field by Grealish, Milano winning 1-0 against Red Star Belgrade, and he's got Trevena's Vens Derri if you prefer. And it's 5-0-3, Sparta Prague, one now. As Juventus do come forward, Klarvic, though, the ball is played wide for him to take down into the full-back position, locks it back to Savonac behind him, losing with the challenge in the city-left-back area. And then it's run-out with play by Docku, that is the throwing to the home side, to the two-time former European champions, Juventus, and Savonac's going to wait here for this to be taken. In fact, the referee says he won't be able to take it because there's the half-time whistle, and it's 0-0, Pat. Just a moment ago, as a frustration, you could hear a couple of things from the Juventus fans behind Manchester City goal there. And the frustration was, Manchester were playing a high-line, they had good passes, they were through passes on, they could trace, and they didn't take the chance to play it. They were just a little bit uncertain, and they showed themselves, look, these chances last for a millisecond, you've got to put it through there. Manchester City have had a couple, and they haven't played them through, which is so enlightening, because they always make the right decisions. When they did play that little through-ball from the 10th position, that's when they got beyond Manchester City, got beyond. Haaland had a chance, couldn't quite take it, and on another occasion, he was a little bit wide. So there's tentativeness all around, and it's not just Manchester City, it's from Juventus players as well. I suspect there will be chances, and a lot more chances in the second half where players are all accentured. Yeah, I hope you're right, Pat, because at half-time here in the beautiful city of Turin, there's Juventus-Nilm and Manchester City-Nilm. And Pat Levin are there for us. Pat, you know, before the game, you were pointing out that there are often cases where you have two teams in very good form who cancel each other out, and sometimes when it's two teams who are in on certain form that you get a really exciting game, we forgot about the third option, which is two teams low on confidence and start taking their chances of the few that they create. And also, on top of that, you're absolutely right with that, but then, I, on top of that, are scared to take risks. And that's what it is. It's the risk taking this, and it's the risk taking the final third of, you know, when Kevin De Bruyne normally gets a ball, and it's on for a millisecond, you shut your eyes, you'll play it. You'll see it, he's fabulous. It's not quite, and really similarly, played one of those three balls, but it's been on a few times, all the way through the pitch, everyone's back to that simplicity, which is exactly what Pep was saying before the game. He wanted to see, you know, simplicity and safety. Well, you don't make a lot of goals doing that. You need to take those chances, and, you know, I expect a little bit better in the second half, you know, more chances in the second half. Players try to take those chances, the good players getting on the ball. There's a lot of good players out there. Yielding is really fabulous. He just isn't getting enough of the ball on the final third. Yielding, of course, has got many chances. Blanovich, great player to watch, where he's at it, chasing and running everywhere, and we know the qualities of Manchester City have got going forward, but as you see, there's limited confidence in a lot of the players, particularly middle-to-front. Pat and John, for now, thank you very much. Hope this goes for you in the second half. Otherwise, the highlight is going to be finding out what's in the bag that Juventus have provided for them. That's coming up in the second half from Turin. Juventus, no Manchester City, 0. Meanwhile, at the Emirates, Arsenal taking on Monaco. Conor McNamara is watching. Arsenal won, Monaco, 0. Bacchio, Saka's goal, six goals in seven Champions League home games now for Saka. And Arsenal fans will love that Miles Lewis-Skelly was at the heart of creating it. Arteta, shorter defenders at the moment. He's thrust in the 18-year-old sort of hybrid full-back midfield roll. Lewis-Skelly rolled this tackle. He played a through ball to Gabriel Jouze that cut through the Monaco defensive line, and then the cross was tapped in by Bucchio Saka. Arsenal do deserve the lead. They've had by far the most chances. Odegaard and Martinelli can't believe they haven't added to it. They put one-on-one chances wide. And whenever Arsenal have scored first in the Champions League this season, they've always gone on to win the game at the break here. Arsenal won Monaco, 0. Conor, thank you very much. Watching everything else in the Champions League this evening, it's John Bennett. So how is the highly anticipated Borussia Dortmund-Basalona game going then, John? Yes, another game that I talk up proves to be really boring. It sounds a bit like the Juventus against Man City game, actually. It's Borussia Dortmund-Neal, Barcelona-Neal. Barça are actually oppressing pretty well, but Dortmund defensively have been superb. Raphinha missed a good half-volley chance for Barcelona. Great pass by Lameña Málvide. It hasn't quite come to life yet that game. Elsewhere, there's a few Neal-Niels. Benfica, Neal, Bologna, Neal. Feyenoord having a brilliant first half against Sparta Prague. They've been up to 10 points as it stands. They're 3-1 up against Sparta Prague. The first time that Feyenoord have scored 3 in the first half of a Champions League game. There was a very emotional moment in the Stuttgart against Young Boys match. Stuttgart won Young Boys, won Young Boys, took the lead early, Lukash Lukomi, and he held up a shirt of his teammate, Mishak Elia. Elia's son sadly passed away this week, so a wonderful tribute by the players to their teammate. And finally, AC Milan won Red Star Belgrade Neal. A brilliant goal. This will be one of the highlights of the BBC Highlights show a bit later on. Rafael bringing the ball down edge of the box. The goalkeeper came out superb half-volley into the top corner. AC Milan won Red Star Belgrade Neal. Thank you very much for that, John. It's not exactly a goal-fest in the championship this evening either, but there is one at the game between Millwall and Sheffield United. They're leading by a goal to Neal. West Brom also taking on Coventry. Is Sani Rajavajalo there? Half-time Sani. Half-time West Brom won Coventry Neal. Alex Mohits' effort from the edge after 12. The difference took a big nick off the unfortunate Josh Eccles. Coventry's best chance had come with just three. Gone, Norman Bassett wriggling through the excellent Alex Palmer smothering. As the keeper did again, a minute from the break from Eccles. Frank Lampard hands in pockets. Alas, chill guy meme. He needs a little more heat from his Coventry side. Half-time West Brom, which I'll be one. Coventry City Neal. Chill guy, I think, excused in the current temperatures. Elsewhere, Hal City Neal, Watford Neal, QPR Neal, Oxford Neal. And it was goalless in the first half between Cardiff and Preston, but there's been an early goal in the second half, and it has gone Preston's way. In the Women's Champions League, it's Celtic Neal, Real Madrid won, and Chelsea three, Twente won. Nadia Maneuver is with us as well this evening, looking at Juventus against Manchester City, but of course part of the match of the day, highlights at 10.40 on BBC One later on this evening. As far as Juve and City are concerned, Nadia and Pat Nevan was saying, it feels like a game in which Nadia the team is prepared to take much of a risk, and it's not making for a massively entertaining first half. Yeah, I would agree. We're just in the room now, watching some of the highlights as it stands, and we're seeing diagonal balls being cut out. This is kind of what we've seen so far, unfortunately, in that first half, but I think for the way that Juventus have been playing, it's forced Manchester City to maybe be a bit more predictable. As Pat said, be a little bit safe passing it sideways, but Elling Holland himself is hugely isolated in the middle, facing two or three bodies around him. But I think if Juve are to try and win this game, I think at times they need to inject some speed with the likes of Yielders on the left wing, and can't stay set on the right, because I think that's when they've looked the most dangerous. And as for City, can you draw them out? Can you try and find a nice bit of play like we saw with just a few minutes left to go, when Elling Holland essentially had a 1v1 after Kevin Dubro and assist, but overall it does look like two teams that are probably lacking a bit of confidence, so I'm more scared to make a mistake than go out there and try and win the game. But you're right to point out that opportunity for Harlan, because that's the kind of shot that normally we'd put away. He didn't do too much wrong though, did he? No, he didn't. Listen, the way he takes one on one is nothing like what I used to do anyway. I'd probably kick that over the bar, and he's tried to chip it just over the goalkeeper and in fairness. I'd probably put it down to a good save, but for how good he is, and for the fact that he is one of the best in the world, you would expect him to score there. And I think it was nice to see from a City perspective that Elling Holland and Kevin Dubro, and again, it's something that we've not really seen that much of in recent months, but if they can get in the groove, then I'm sure they'll feel they've got an opportunity to win many games of football. Nadim, I know you've got a lot on as you prepare for that programme later on this evening, so thank you very much for joining us. It's Juventus Nyl, Manchester City Nyl at the moment, Arsenal leading Monaco by a goal to Nyl. We'll keep you across that. We've got a second half commentary of Juve against Manchester City, and we'll keep you across all the games that are happening in the Champions League this evening. We're going to check in now on the BBC News headlines with Jill McKenzie. The Voice of the UK. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thank you. Good evening. The Children's Commissioner for England has told 5 Live Sara Sharif's murder has to be a catalyst for change. Rachel DeSousa said the 10-year-old was failed by the safety net that should have been around her. Earlier, Sara's father and stepmother were found guilty of her murder. Irfan Sharif and Beynish Batul subjected Sara to years of violence. There'll be sentence next week alongside Sara's uncle Faisal Malik, who was found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child. Rachel DeSousa spoke to us earlier. For years and years we've seen these deaths, and we get told lessons will be learned, you know, agencies will work together. I've had enough of that. I mean, Sara Sharif's death is so shocking. We need change. We need action. We need it now. Fighters in Syria have broken into the tomb of Hafez Al-Assad, the former president and father of the ousted Bashar al-Assad. Images show a coffin and parts of the mausoleum on fire in the family's hometown. Police investigating possible crimes linked to the post office scandal say they're looking at dozens of potential suspects. They include employees of the post office and Fujitsu, the company which made the faulty Horizon IT system, the led to sub-postmasters being accused of stealing. But police say any potential trials won't start until at least 2027, after the public enquiries finished. Commander Stephen Clayman is leading the operation. This allows us to take a significant move forward in terms of pace. And we are always tied to the public enquiry, but the scale of it is the sheer number of victims involved. We've got, you know, we think over 3,000 people affected in some way by Horizon in this manner. So it's huge. So we've got to put in the commensurate number of officers. LGBT veterans who were dismissed from the armed forces for being gay could get up to £70,000 in compensation. Some were convicted of sex offences while homosexuality was considered a crime. Applications for the government scheme will open on Friday. And the head of the FBI says he'll resign before President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month. Republicans have criticised Christopher Wray because of the FBI's investigations into Mr Trump after his previous stint in the White House. Count the goals the last-minute screams. From Cantoners flair to Aguero's dreams, the blue moon rises, the red flames burn. To the Etihad now, all eyes return. Feel the roar as the rivals meet with Bernardo's glides and Bruno's quick feet. From Garnaccio's precision to Harlan's stride, from the pitch to the stands the passion thrives. Through Derby days, through Glory's chase, cities charge in United's grace. The pride of Manchester never dies, as legends are made and foes collide. The Manchester Derby, Sunday from 4.30 on BBC Radio 5 Live. This is 5 Live Sports. The Champions League with Kelly Cates. Listen on BBC Sounds. We'll be back to Turin very shortly for the second half of Juventus against Manchester City. No goals as yet. Also in the Champions League, Arsenal lead Monaco by a goal to nil. We'll keep you up to date with everything that happens there. And of course we're across everything that's happening in the championship this evening, including at Millwall where they're taking on Sheffield United and Aaron Paul's watching. Ten minutes since the restart, Millwall-Nill, Sheffield United won the blades. Still leading for Rian Brewster's first half strike. His first goal, Kelly, in 27 months. It's a big goal for him. It's a big goal for Sheffield United. The win here takes them top of the championship tonight. Millwall-Nill, Sheffield United won. And QPR have gone one nil up against Oxford United. Sam Field has scored the goal for them. There'll be a special football daily out later this evening on the news that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup. Wickham Wanderers player and the PFA's first sustainability champion, David Wheeler, has been talking about it, about the environmental impact both of Saudi host in the tournament and the World Cups before that. If we just rewind a little bit just to the 2026 World Cup where you're talking about spanning a whole continent in USA, Mexico, Canada, which in itself is insane. Moving on to, like you said, looking at three different continents, having to have that amount of flying, which is the other major climate impact. But also, all of these World Cups from here on out are going to have 40 more matches than they have done, which in itself is going to have a huge, huge carbon footprint. But also, look at the Saudi Arabia World Cup. They're one of the worst offenders in terms of trying to slow down the transition away from fossil fuels, international climate negotiations, and giving them a platform on the world stage like this is only going to make that situation worse when it's clear that government officials and people that represent us on the international stage are finding it difficult enough to agree on the simplest of things in transitioning away from fossil fuels. Would you want to hear players talking up about it more? Absolutely, yeah. I mean, we've seen from the letter of over 100 female players to FIFA to drop their sponsorship with Saudi around Coat that there are many female players that are willing to speak up. But there still, sadly, is a lack of male players prepared to do the same. But yeah, especially now with so much time until the Saudi World Cup, I really hope that there are professional players, top professional players that come out and say that this isn't a good idea. But I want to stress that it shouldn't really be down to the players as much as it would help. It should be down to the governing bodies. They shouldn't be sitting on their hands and taking this lightly. I'd look to the FA especially as a leader to say that, no, we're not going to take this line down. We're not accepting this. This is not in line with our values and there is time to find another host. That was David Wheeler talking about the environmental impact. The Saudi government says it's diversifying away from fossil fuels and trying to reduce emissions and has rejected criticism that it's using sport to distract from its record on sustainability. FIFA's World Cup evaluation report said, whilst the extent of construction would have a material environmental impact, the bid provides a good foundation for delivering mitigation measures to address some of the environment-related challenges. The FA said today, the FA board met the Saudi Arabian Football Federation last month. We asked them to commit to ensuring all fans would be safe and welcome in Saudi Arabia in 2034, including LGBTQ plus fans. They assured us that they are fully committed to providing a safe and welcome environment for all fans. There's a much more in-depth look at those issues and all the issues around the 2034 World Cup and indeed the 2030 World Cup on the podcast which is available later on BBC Sounds. The players are out in Turin. It's Juventus Nill, Manchester City Nill as we head into the second half in the company of Pat Nevin and John Murray. Thank you very much Kelly. It was a bit of a banana cake actually that was in the brown bag, which was very nice. There was much more than that, innit? Yeah, there was much more than that. There was a soup which I thought was asparagus and you thought was cauliflower. I think it meant we had mix of the two. There was another exciting little bag after I finished the soup which turned out to have croutons in it that I should have put in the soup. Vision John, vision I picked up with Nill very good. Teams are just taking their places. No changes at half time. You can still hear the sound of the Juventus Stadium. Unmistakable. Nill Nill as the second half begins with Juventus. De Gregorio in goal. Savona, Gatti, Kalulu and Danilo are the back four. Just trying to get my stopwatch started. I think it may be seized up in the Alpine cold. Danilo, the captain at left back. Locatelli in two around with Coupe miners in the midfield area. Konze Sau and Yildiz and the Flanks and Vlahavic through the middle. Manchester City as well as they started. The ball is currently with their goalkeeper. Edison, who's back in the side tonight, Ortega on the bench. The mainly three central defenders, Walker, Diaz and Gavardiol with Gundawan and Lewis in the middle of midfield. And then the line of four really, Bernardo Silva, De Bruyne, Grealish and Dooku and Harland through the middle. And the one big chance really, certainly for Manchester City, that Harland had was very well saved by De Gregorio. But normally you would see Harland took that away. He would do it. Keep on getting into those positions and he will put one of them away. But the one thing I would say to Man City fans, you may not have been terrible, but they are nowhere near the force they were. Just a number of months ago. It's not back yet. 45 minutes with the controlled parts of the game. But it's a long way short of the Manchester City that was so dominant before. Very much so in the week that they play Manchester United in one of our five live Premier League commentaries this weekend. Juventus going down the right-hand side. Konze Sau wins the first corner of the second half. Arsenal winning 1-0 by the way, if you just switched on to us. Arsenal 1-0 up on Monaco. So Arsenal currently in fifth place in this table. But Juventus in Manchester City way down closer to the elimination zone than they are to the automatic places for the round of 16. Here's the Juventus corner into the edge of the six yard box headed away by Diaz. Comes out on that slice badly by Yildiz. Actually it's kept in, but the offside flag is up against Coop Miners, so it's a free kick to Manchester City. Second minute, nil nil Pat Nebbin. I can't believe I actually touched the ball there because Newham was going to be offside. Let it roll out for the throw-in, then you can press up. Actually touching it when you're 10 yards offside is just daft. It's nothing more than that. It was certainly a piece of play to do, but yeah, a little bit of a better start. Setting off there for Juventus, they're getting high up the pitch. To the right it's that the first half, you know, where Rico Lewis going in playing in that centre midfield position. Coming from left-back where he's defending, he's a very, very important player. He's really struggled to have an impact, hasn't he? Not much of an impact at all in this game. Again, underlining how difficult it is to play that position in control games. Yeah, Rico Lewis, who has been a big part of things for Manchester City this season. He's one of the players who's been able to stay fit, and he was picked out, wasn't he, by Pep Guardiola last night for his efforts. As Kalulu at the other end, the left-sided central defender plays it back to Di Gregorio with his blonde beard. The chip from him, but De Niro couldn't keep it in, so it's out of play for a throw-in to Manchester City. This time tomorrow you'll be listening to Rangers against Tottenham. Don't miss that tomorrow night. We'll have all of the British and Irish sides covered in the European competitions tomorrow evening. Chelsea on their way to Kazakhstan. Well, they should be there now, shouldn't they? Yes, as the ball is put out of play by Kalulu for a throw-in to City. Walker has come up to take it. And then on Friday, by the way, must mention the World Cup qualifying draw is going to be at 11 o'clock UK time. Live from Zurich, we'll have coverage. I'm off there tomorrow, actually. We'll have coverage in Five Live, and Adrian Childs' show, but you'll be able to listen to it on Five Live, and watch it on the iPlayer, and follow it via the BBC Sport app. So that's a World Cup qualifying draw Friday morning from 11 o'clock. As you know, Pat, I'm going on the train to Zurich, which I'm very much looking forward to, through the Alps. I've done that train before, and it's yet a clear day. It is one of the most beautiful journeys in the world. Well, that's what it is. Manchester City in possession with Bernardo Silva down below us. Here is the substitute's warm-up just off the pitch. That's nice. Gunderman with a shot that's blocked, and then Harlan with his back to go, stuck out a leg, couldn't bring it down. That was a chance for Gunderman. That's more like Kevin De Bruyne, I guess, in this wide area, and he zips the pass in this team. Not let him go in, he might go, zips it in, and Gunderman, he tries to get it on to... Well, tries to get a shot on. Comes to Harlan there, but there's no way he's going to get a shot away from there. The ball's behind him, and the chance just dribbled away, but it's much, much better than Kevin De Bruyne can play those passes quicker with more authority. Manchester City in the Maroon kit, attacking towards the end where all the noise is coming from that you can hear from the Juventus fans with their many and varied flags. Dooku back to Grealish. Grealish brings it in field. Jack Grealish just his ninth start of the season, had a couple of spells out. Now Walker, Kyle Walker then rolls it here to Bernardo Silva. Early ball in, it's dummied on the edge of the box, but I think it might have flicked the heel of Gunderman, and that meant the Juventus in the black and white stripes, broad black and white stripes on the front of their shirts this season. We're able to play it at the Vlajvic, it was challenged by Dias, goes to Ground and it's a free kick to the home side, just to the left of the central circle. Chelsea's women now 5-1 up on 20 in the Champions League, so 5-1 to Chelsea, and it's still Celtic Nyl Real Madrid 1 in that group. Gatti at the back, Federico Gatti who rolls up from the lower reaches. He was playing in the fourth tier of Italian football and got this dream move to the event, and now he's in the Champions League, a very rugged central defender, very much in the mould of his hero, Kialini. That's a poor ball, but he's been fortunate there, did reach Kutminers. Gatti couldn't intercept it, and now Savona, but Conce Sáocum short and Juventus have gone back into their own half. There was another opportunity, that ball we're talking about was City playing very, very high line, they were only 10 yards inside their own half there, but the ball was played over the top. It just didn't have anyone, Juventus, in the midfield, you could look up and see that pass there, but Kutminers, that's probably the third time he's actually run and beat the offside trap, and the ball has just not been delivered. So it remains nil-nil, Juventus potentially involved in yet another draw, having drawn seven of their last nine in all competitions. Turan, up to Vláovic, stuck out of foot, couldn't control it. Gavardioli was able to play it forward to Grealish, he's gone tumbling down off the ball, might have just been brushed by Yildiz, and then Kevin de Bruner through the middle, Gatti comes out strongly, wins the ball against de Bruner, and Big Gatti has taken it downfield and has now played it out to Konceysau on the right wing. Konceysau against Lewis still going, twisting and turning inside the box, Gavardioli is there as well, Konceysau then gives it back to Savonar, and then all the way back for the ball to be played in. A spectacular shot by Gatti near the penalty spot that was saved by Edison, and it comes again, and it's headed in, I think that's it, is it over the line? It is, it's given, the header forced in by Vláovic, Edison on the line, made a scrambling save, but it was over the line, and Juventus are in front. This is trouble for Manchester City, and the Champions League here in Turan. Manchester City is now there complaining, they feel as if it was, it was claiming like the back post there, they were really good playing the right hand side there, really livened up, down the right hand side by Konceysau, he goes and takes on two men, drags Flairs away, and gets the ball in the back post, this Sander's ball he kicked from Gatti, which fantastic, what else was he doing up there? He just kept it to the, he stayed on off, the ball went, it was put in again, I'm amazed you're nice, I brought you a spot for you, I didn't think it was over the line from Vláovic, but it was. Yeah, next to the post, Edison sort of parried it, it bounced down, and as he tried to claw it away, it did, well the technicals have confirmed it, no line technology, by the time he clawed it away, it had just bounced over the line. Yeah, hey, it's mellowed me over the line, but that's what we've got the technology for, to work it, the referee's going to have a look, and there's that claimant at the back post, I don't think he's going to give it at all, Vláovic today, I have to say I'm very, very impressed with him, he has chased and harried all the way, and the goal is given. Yeah, goal is confirmed, there was no foul involved in that, which I think is the right decision, I must say, when he's seen it once again, but it came initially, as I mentioned, Gatti had taken the ball forward from central defence, then ended up in a position, like the centre forward, and it was his volley that forced the initial save from Edison, but then Yildiz was onto it, and his cross ultimately headed for the goal. We were talking earlier on about risk taking, no one was taking risks, that's the biggest risk of the game so far, Gatti plays it out from centre half, and instead of stopping, he just gets his heels pinned back and goes, and he goes all the way up, and gets to the 18 yard line, but then stays there, he doesn't think, oh it's not coming right away, he stays when the ball came in, what a brilliant effort, the scissors kept that, and what a dream, actually what a fairytale that would have been, had he scored the goal. Yeah, and what about Edison, was the more he could have done with that, I mean the header was from relatively close range, did parry it initially, as Manchester City, who have now dropped down to 22nd in the Champions League table, with this scoreline losing 1-0 here, they are just, well they're just three places above the elimination places. The points, that's the thing, the points Charlie, it's not enough points, they need more points. And even if they win their final two matches, then you would think that would not be enough to get them into the top eight, and it might get worse here, as Juventus Lavich, the goal scorer, having just scored his 10th goal of the season, plays it for Konce Sáu, Konce Sáu, then to the left hand side, Vljavíc, deep cross, that's dangerous, but it's headed by the right back Savona, well wide of goal. QPR are now two nil up on Oxford, Sam Field, I think scored the first goal, yes he did, so that is two goals for QPR, two goals for Sam Field in the Champions League, Barcelona have taken the lead through Rafinha, so Dortmund nil, Barcelona one, and VfB Stuttgart now 2-1 ahead against young boys, the Swiss side did lead in that match, and that means that Barcelona are now in second place in the live table. Manchester City, De Bruyne up on Arta Silva, now to Grealish in the D, Manchester City having to come from behind here in Turin, Dooku in the area on the left hand side, excellent footplay, Dooku shot, that's blocked, Lewis now with a chance, that's blocked as well by Kupmeiners, who threw himself in front of it, and Manchester City have dealt that game, but that's what they're doing as Walker goes round the outside, Walker, his ball in field pass to Nilo, and Juventus will pass it away from the back. In fact, they don't, Gundoans won it back from Kallulu, and Manchester City will come again, Walker in field to De Bruyne, De Bruyne has passed straight into the legs of the defender, now Vlávic and Juventus might be away on the counter attack here, and Vlávic goes for the pass to Konce Sao, and he brings it down, but he took him wide, however the chance is still possibly here for Juventus, Konce Sao brings it back into the area and shoots into the legs of Guardiol, and it bounces away to Grealish near the halfway line. I can't believe Konce Sao didn't take Guardiol on there, he just ran up, Guardiol is backing away, backing away, backing away, keep on going, don't need to shoot for that angle there, you had him on source, don't know why he didn't do it, however, since the goal, the pace has been picked up from Manchester City, the pace that they should play it, they have to play it if they're going to be successful, and right now talking about pace and lightning, sort of, quickness in the final third, I think Phil Forden's needed here, and I think he's coming on, what is he? Is he warming up? So it's 1-0 to Juventus, Dusan Vlávic's goal, that Edison wasn't able to keep out, but Gundogan now through the middle, slips it to his left to Grealish, Grealish into the D, now to the right, and Bernardo Silva with the shot, straight into Danilo, his former teammate, and it depletes wide for a corner to the visitors. I know it's only a couple of minutes, but since they lost the goal, Manchester have been absolutely fantastic, back to Manchester City, playing at that tempo, but everybody wanting the ball, everyone zipping the ball about, imagine it to passes, taking risks with those chances in these passes as well. You want to see them do that all day, the only thing they've done it in the game, is since they lost that goal. Yeah, as you can hear, the sound's been turned up by the Juventus supporters, corner easily here to where by Coopminers, and then Flicks from Gundogan and De Bruyne, but one back by Yildiz, who turns it into his own penalty area, where Kalulu will volley it downfield, but Manchester City are coming on more strongly here, they've raised their game since going behind in the 54th minute, we're all going to go back to Arsenal in a moment, but Manchester City are threatening here, De Bruyne, Arsenal are winning 1-0, Manchester City losing 1-0, the 2023 Champions, Manchester City, who've been in two of the last four Champions League finals, but with this scoreline, are in some danger in this new Champions League. Here's Gundogan, as Manchester City are parked in the Juventus Har, his ball forward to Dockers, on the right now, Dockers ball across, and then he's cleared away out of play by Gattie for a throw in, and in fact the offside flag was up, and that will give us the opportunity to get an update from Conor McNamara, who's at the Emirates Stadium. You join us at a choice moment, because Arsenal have just got their first corner of the game, this is where the entrance fee is, Arsenal lead by Bukai Osaka's Golden Hill, Monaco who have improved since the break, they brought on to Kuni Minimino, the former Liverpool player, he's already had a shot off target, Arsenal's got a lot of good football choreography here, Arsenal players at the back post, referee is having to sort it all out, Declan Rice getting ready to take the quarter kick, you've probably heard John that Nicholas Yover, the set-piece coach, has been given his own mural outside the stadium by Arsenal fans, so in Aberdeen they buy his routines for these quarter kicks, so here it comes after the big build-up, Declan Rice from the left-hand side, towards the back post, and wouldn't you know it's pushed away by the goalkeeper, Arsenal won, Monaco nil. So 1-0 to Arsenal, Manchester City still 1-0 down, and Juventus just causing a problem with the ball into the penalty area that was parried by Edison, and the ball very nearly fell to Juventus. Well, parried's been chained about it, but Jovibe better than that, I wouldn't blame him for the goal, however, I think a number of people possibly would. Goku now near the edge of the box, that he was not fouled by Locatelli, thought he had a case there, but referee Dupan says no, and so it's brought away by Juventus in the Champions League. Everyone can see this, that thrown through the middle, I mentioned a few minutes ago, Cook Miners keeps on making this kind of inside-forward move to a high line, and the whole place shouts, play it, he's now done it three times, and he's not being played in, Manchester City cannot allow that to keep on happening, or else Cook Miners will get through one of the goals. Thank you. Later scores in the five matches in the championship tonight. Cardiff Nill, Preston One, to Pulsity Nill, Watford Nill, three-kick Juventus in the centre-circle, Milwarn Nill, Sheffield United, one, QPR, two-nil up against Oxford, and West Brom won, Coventry Nill. Of course, Juventus have got nothing on West Brom in terms of being draw specialist, West Brom who've drawn ten of their last eleven. And even with this, just a very good point. Here is Turan, who goes back to the edge of the penalty area, and just give your microphone a bit of attention, Pat, for a moment or two. Yeah, as D Grigorial, long and forward from him, might have struck the arm of Vlavic, Diaz is with him, but Gavadio comes across, Juventus are claiming that Diaz manhandled Vlavic, but I felt he hand-balled it in the initial stage. Manchester City have got it back, and are attacking again, De Bruyne to Docku, then back to De Bruyne, and to Docku in the area, could open up here, but the ball all agree across the six-yard box, eventually rolls out for a throw-in next to the corner flag. We'll just get that sorted, Pat. I think we've got it sorted. Exactly. Now, Bruyne for me, it wasn't between Kevin De Bruyne and Docku, it puts the ball across between the centre-backs of the goalkeeper. Of course, you're expecting that manhandling to be there, but he just went to the penalty spot expecting the cut-back. You have to take a chance at this, Reica. You took the chance that it would be cut-back, and it wasn't. Much better. Dortmund have equalised against Barcelona. Seru Girasi has made it Dortmund 1, Barcelona 1, and VSB Stuttgart now 3-1 up on Young Boys. And it's a corner. It's actually a good for a corner. Yes, it did. The corner went out for a throw-in. Manchester City have taken the corner, they took it short to Bruyne. To Bruyne, turns, and then passes it straight into the corner. And Juventus can counterattack, but consists of a waste of the pass. Manchester City might have a chance here with Juventus having committed men downfield. Greenish then, Greenish running at Kalulu, then getting it square to De Bruyne. De Bruyne now to Docku, Docku then across, hits the defender, bounces down. Bernardo Silva back to De Bruyne, still in the area, puts one foot on it. Then the shot from Gundawan, and it comes out with Walker. And he's blocked away by Danilo to the halfway line. But you know Manchester City have got this in them. If they can do it since they go home, since losing a goal, they're utterly dominated to play. They're up in the final third, everybody's running at a much, much quicker pace. They're looking to get beyond their defender's timing again. It's Manchester City of old, but you've got to do that much more often than just as soon as you go 1-0 down. Fianna Auto scored three goals against Manchester City, and their last match have scored four goals tonight against struggling Sparta Prague, so that is 4-1. Let's go back to Millwall and Aaron Paul. 10 minutes to go here, Millwall-Nil Sheffield united one, Rian Brewster's goal, the only goal of the game. Both sides have had opportunities, the best from Mihail Ervanovich, played in on the left-hand side by Kastar D'Norra, and Vanovic-Nacerbian just smashing the ball over the bar. Millwall-Nil Sheffield united one. And Sani Radhra Vajala has the latest from the Hawthorns. 65 gone, West Bromwant Coventry nailed. Norman Bassett with a flying header for Coventry, five yards out, unmarked, heading wide just a moment ago. Big chance for Coventry, West Brom still lead. West Bromwant, Coventry City nil. Don't get many Normans now, do you? De Bruyne, 25 yards out, hits the shot, but it bounces well wide, just runs his fingers through his hair, goal kick, 1-0, your Ventus lead. Absolutely. By the way, with names, they get very unhacked through a wealth. And then when they come very, very, very unhacked, they're suddenly happy again. Well, look out for Normans. Well, look out for Johns, maybe. I'm sorry, you're buying them here. You don't get many baby Johns these days. 20 minutes played in the second half, and Manchester City have to pull something out here. And they're facing the possibility, Manchester City, of what would become a seventh defeat in their last 10 matches. Absolutely extraordinary and unthinkable in many ways. But they have lifted it, and it shows you that they're capable of doing it and playing at that height. What it does ensure you is that they can keep on playing that way for sustained periods of time, and that's maybe the bigger question. Love the two managers. It looks as though it's going to be Thiago Mota, the tall, rather urbane, former Italian and former Brazilian international, who's going to make the first couple of changes. Timothy Ware is being prepared to come on as is Western McKinney, the American international, who had that spell on loan at Leeds. That's very attack-minded, isn't it? Yep. Two strikers. McKinney can play in all sorts of positions, can't he? Lewis playing the ball towards the left-hand side. Grealish now. Grealish turns, gives it back to Gavadio, puts his foot on the ball, square in the D. Oh, Gundawang with a shot that is well saved, diving up to his left, DiGrigorio did well to get to that. I think Gundawang knows how close that is. When you had to play, as a player, your reaction tells you something. He was very close there. Good save again. Bernardo Silva now after short corner, and then Gundawang crosses block behind by Gatti, which the referee says did come back onto Gundawang, so it's a goal kick to Juventus. Again, the speed of the movement, the willingness of everyone to get involved. Before that, it was just so... slag, you know, kind of laid back. Lovely shot. We've got a different angle from here on our monitors by Gundawang. He called it round three players, and he's just got a big right hand to the keeper. He's just going to hit the end so the post can go in. Great play there. Really unlucky. OK, so these two changes, Timothy Weier coming on to replace Conce Sao, and that looks as though it will be a straight swap. He is a wing out, but can play through the middle. And it's... Sorry, K-Fran Turam, who's coming off from the midfield to be replaced by Weston McKenney, who's one of the many Juventus players, just like Manchester City have had, who have been on the injured list. Douglas Louise is back on the bench tonight after his big-money move from Aston Villa. There's actually a bit of talk, isn't there, about Douglas Louise moving back to England, possibly in January, such as those things have not worked out really from here so far. But a double change from Juventus, Manchester City needing a goal, facing defeat. And we are into the final quarter of the match now. 1-0 to the home side here, and that's still the case with you. Conor McNamara. Yes, Arsenal leading Monaco by a goal to 0, and the speed chances of both ends here, Oda got just denied by a marvellous save. It probably wouldn't have counted anyway. Gabriel J. Zous was blocking the keeper's view. It would have gone to review to see if he was involved, but the keeper saved anyway, so it didn't matter. Down the other end, Giorgio Gigno gave the ball away and presented a chance to Impolo, who shot low and fractionally wide. Monaco much better now, Arsenal won Monaco 0. Manchester City on the attack here, in Turin on this cold, dry night. Bernardo Silva. Bernardo Silva takes it back out into the full-back position. He uses Jack Grealish. Grealish just drops his shoulder and then runs into Savona, but keeps possession, comes back to him. Two of them working together. Bernardo Silva and Grealish. Big tactical change as well. Grealish has gone left-wing, Dooku has gone right-wing, Bernardo Silva much, much more central, which he will enjoy more. And maybe that will favour Manchester City. Dooku trying to get round D'Anello, but couldn't do so. Yieldies was back in there, helping him out, and then it's chipforked by D'Anello for Coupe Miners. Ruben Diaz is able to come across, put it out of play. Coupe Miners gets a ball from the side of the pitch, takes the throat of Lavaic, who was off and running down the left-hand side, and Guardiola, fortunately, was sharp, stayed with him, and in the end, Edison was able to clear. He's very game-fliavich, isn't he? He won't chase pigeons, he won't go after absolutely anything. Really, really selfless centre forward. The phrase you don't often hear. So, 1-0, Juventus lead. Five-lives from the BBC. Radio Manchester are with us tonight as well for the commentary, as they will be on Sunday, providing the commentary. Radio Manchester and five-lives from the Manchester Derby. Here is Grealish, Grealish back to Lewis, and then Lewis with a high ball across field, taken down by Dooku. Dooku into the penalty area now, then plays it back to the edge, the corner of the box, walker with the cross, stretching header away by Gacchi. It comes out to Guardiola, gets his head down, and the Croatian takes it. The striker take it round the outside of Wehr, who was back there inside his own penalty area to block it behind for a city corner. He's actually won, Guardiola took it further forward, if you possibly can. Yeah, he's one of the centre-backs, but he's also a danger coming in from left-hand side when he gets forward. Corner taken short, Grealish receives it from Bernardo Silva, then back to De Bruyne, now back to Bernardo Silva again. Bernardo Silva leaves Yildiz on his backside, then the shot from Best Bar to 25 yards, misses over the top of the bar from De Bruyne, and it remains for straight, Inglis Manchester City, one-nil down. It is, and it's not the fact that Juvenas have decided just to set back. They've been pushed back, they've been pushed back by a better side, who look lively, who look up for it, who look as if they understand the importance of this. They kind of keep on saying, oh, we'll do it in the next one, we'll do it in the next one. They're running out of games, not only in Europe, but domestically as well. They are. One-nil to Juventus, a woman just makes her way behind us, she was wrapped in a blanket and had a big, fur-ringed poncho on. She wasn't taking any risks with the cold, churin weather. Well, she goes down the stairs, there's Manchester City, take a throw-in on the halfway line. Here's Grealish. Grealish, back to the halfway line to Gavardiol, now Ruben Diaz. Diaz, one of the leaders, part of the leadership group that all the top teams, probably most of the not-top teams have as well now as well, it's all the Rages now, leadership group, Gavardiol, then back to Lewis. Manchester City needs someone to step up here, Kyle Walker. And even a draw for Manchester City would have them struggling in terms of getting into that top eight. Also Milan have been pegged back, Red Star Belgrade have made it 1-1 against Milan, the seven times European champions. Juventus have won it only twice, record winners of the Italian league though. Manchester City though, through the middle, winners of the English championship, four years running. But back it goes towards the halfway line, Lewis now, for City, gets it going again, carries it forward, closer to the heart of the Juventus half. But it's black and white stripes, very much in the I-Lines, as Dooku then runs into Danilo, and Danilo will look to play it away, uses Vlavage, then Danilo, and he has McKenny, and McKenny to wear, and wear, sprinting into the penalty area on the right-hand side, went for the cross, hit Lewis, another cross, and then the chance to score! And that is 2-0 to Juventus, and Leicester McKenny, drives it in from 10 yards, and Manchester City have got real problems in the Champions League now, 2-0 down here. Well, I said to him about 10 minutes ago, he's played that high lane, they will eventually play through it. I would bet I thought it was offside, but he's played that ball through there, and it's a chance you take when you're trying to play that high lane, after a time to right, it's been coming. You just don't seem quick enough to get back in those sort of areas, and again, brilliant substitution to do that in McKenny. Look, do you know what? It looks offside, but it isn't, because Diaz is playing them on, I think, in the near side here, and there's no reason for him to do that, apart from anything else. What a finish by McKenny, absolutely brilliant. Very similar to the hook shot that we've seen a little bit earlier on from Gatti when he broke up there, that led to the first goal. Super shot, 2-0, long, long way back for Manchester City now. Well, listen to this, there are just over 40,000 people inside this stadium, and my goodness, they are creating some atmosphere. Many of their flags are now waving again, the Juventus supporters, this will do them the power of good. Remember, they have only lost once all season in all competitions, but now Manchester City are really staring at the prospect of a seventh defeat in their last 10 matches, as Grealish can't reach this, and it's out of play for a throwing to Juventus in their own right back area. Well, on Saturday here, Juventus came back from 2-0 down, but Manchester City, it just felt that that next goal was so important, and it's gone to Juventus, who are 2-0 up. Let's go to Hawthorne's, Sani Radrava-Jula. Same score as you've got, Inter in now, West Bromwich Albion, 2-0, Coventry City, 0-0, Carl and Grant skipping past two players, shooting from the edge of the area and finding the bottom corner for his fifth of the season. Very hard to see a way back for Coventry City now. 76 going West Bromwich Albion, Coventry City, 0-0. Real Madrid are now 2-0 up at Celtic in the Women's Champions League, and Watford have equalised against Hull City with a goal from Rocco Varta. So Hull City won, Watford won, 2-0 to Juventus here, and this is going to leave Manchester City in a perilous position with eight points from six matches and two to play in January, in France against PSG, and then at home to Club Bruges. But it might already be beyond them to finish in the top eight. As I said, you had this shot before. I think it has been behind it for something. Harlan now, but can't get there as the ball is played through by Bernardo Silva. Manchester City are going to bring on Savino, and that will be the first change that Pipp Guardiola has made in this match. You must have thought of making the changes at half-time, and given them a bit of a while. After you lost the goal, you're probably ready to make a change there, and I think you had Foden ready to come on. Manchester City had their best period. You've got to say that. The best period of Manchester City's game was between losing the first goal and losing the second goal. It's a little bit of a shame on them. That's a wee bit harsh on them that they did lose that second goal then. But that high line they were playing is always a danger when you've got questionable centre-back tearing. Don't play together all the time. We talked about this before, the time with Kelly K. You're playing a game if you're changing keeper, but it's changing that back line, whether it's because you have to or not, all the time it seems every single week. You've got to let them play with each other and understand where each other is. And they lost that goal there. It's because they didn't know where each other was. Manchester City make the change, and it's Savino, who's still yet to score his first goal for Manchester City, who probably understandably comes on for Dooku, who started tonight, but that was only his second start since October. Barcelona have gone back in front in Germany against Dortmund. Ferrant Torres has got that goal, so Dortmund won. Barcelona 2, and Preston are now 2-0 up on Cardiff. Militin Osmaic has got a late goal there to presumably clinch it for Preston, which would be their first win since October. Cardiff 0-Preston 2, and Stuttgart 5-1 up on Young Boys now. Arsenal still winning 1-0 against Monaco. Pukajosak has first half goal, and Manchester City 2-0 down here. And Savino with his first attempt to break down the right conceder, throwing 4-0 in 10 yards away from the corner flag. It was 1-0 to Arsenal, Conor McNamara. They've just made it 2, same goal scored, Pukajosak, and this will move Arsenal even further up the Asit stands table. They're up to fourth place now. Monaco, who came out in good determined mood at the start of this second half, they've given it a real goal, but Arsenal reasserting the dominance they showed in the first half. They're 12.5 minutes to play, two goals from Saka. Arsenal 2-Monaco 0. Arsenal in very good heart. Liverpool top of the table, Barcelona second, Arsenal third, Aston Villa in fifth, and as we know after Celtics draw yesterday, Celtic, in very much with a chance of getting a playoff place in February, down in 21st currently, but they are ahead of Manchester City in the table still. They have every belief that Celtic will get in there. Manchester City, walk up. We're into the 81st minute now. Listen, there's nothing to say that Manchester City can't come up with a couple of goals, quick, sharp, but in their current state, then that is stretching belief, but we'll see, walk up. Now to Kevin De Bruyne. De Bruyne, then square from him. Last we looked, which wasn't too long ago, Erling Harlan had only 13 touches in this match, had a big chance in the first half that was saved by D. Gregorio, two important saves from him. De Bruyne has balled now into the eventless penalty area, that's headed down and away by Locca Telli, that Manchester City through Dias are able to play it back to Edison who wanders out of his penalty area. The two goals are not a match in this season, but it's a win for the team, and we will see them whistle shortly in the 7-45 kick-offs. It has gone at the den with you, Aaron Paul. Neil Harris bids farewell to the den on the back of the feet, his side beating courtesy of a first half where he had a brew strike, Mill will hit the post twice, but couldn't find a level. The win though, takes Sheffield United, top of the league, Mill will nil, Sheffield United won, joined us after 10 o'clock on five lives tonight and Manchester said he with Grealish, Grealish then rolls his foot over the ball turns back in field still he's being chased he might have been shoved over there he was freekick given for the challenge by Locketeli so freekick to Manchester city 25 yards out Pat Nevin. It's a good thing to remember the times and the ball was placed there watch Kevin De Bruyne and walk up to everything this is a great good chance it still is a chance because you know the quality he's got but it just the quality hasn't been there with Kevin De Bruyne most of the time tonight but you know he's capable that's the thing it only needs that one moment for him to put it in the top corner it's maybe about three or four yards further out than he would like. De Bruyne waiting the event is for organizing themselves I can tell you it has finished whole city one Wapford one in Rubenssellers his first match in charge it at whole city and also it's finished Cardiff nil Preston De Bruyne now ready takes the freekick to the back post Diaz headed across the event as spots but that was comfortably cleared out for a throw down on this side of the pitch where Pep Guardiola with his hands in his pockets sweeping back the sides of that padded coat facing yet another defeat. It's a funny thing because you look Pep Guardiola has been Brown for a long long time but no one's perfect and everyone makes mistakes so you know when you look at that second goal where it came from there's no left back there is no left back and the ball she's played in there there's a massive amount of space where's your left back sitting in the centre of my field. Grealish is committed to foul so Juventus who were playing the ball downfield but it was over hit so the referee's brought it back and it's the yellow card for Grealish for the foul freekick to Juventus. They're absolutely right Pat. For another manager does that and the ball is played completely over where the left back is. There's a gigantic space there and the stretchers defence which is a high lane anyway and they score a goal for it you would ask that question. I suspect in their coverage in the television tonight with Nederman Lads I think they might look at that. If you haven't heard by the way from this season from 10 o'clock tonight all of these midweek Champions League matches you can see the highlights from all of them that's on the iPlayer and then there is the match of the day the Champions League match of the day which is on after the news this evening with Mark Chapman and the team. A couple more changes for Juventus Yildiz and Vláovic are being substituted. Vláovic scored his tenth goal for Juventus this season tonight and Vláovic goes, applauds to the crowd with Samuel Ambangula the Belgian under 21 international winger another of the youngsters the 20 year old coming on and also Douglas Louise making his return. He's not played since October Douglas Louise after a hamstring injury so the former Aston Villa and indeed Manchester City man is on to the field number 26 as he is for Juventus. 2-0 Juventus lead just five minutes to play Pat. Yeah and they have managed to calm it down. There weren't any big things that Juvi have got. You know when they've got the first goal there and they sat back a little bit and went into that system which was almost a 5-3, a 5-4-1 and you thought he looked really comfortable there they've done that before and it was very very hard for Manchester City to break through and they made a couple of chances but they've not been able to keep up the entire time for as long as you need to do to keep on creating chances however he is one. De Bruyne on the right ball across and it was actually Douglas Louise who was there in position with his first touch inside the penalty area he was trying to pick out Gundawan on the edge of the box and now Bernardo Silva's got involved in a bit of nonsense with Gatti and De Gregorio. Yellow card for Bernardo Silva. That's so harsh. When little Bernardo Silva goes in, he keeps us wasting time. The centre-back's mucking about as well. He's tried to go in and close the ball down a little bit and as he's going in to get him to go the defenders can have backed himself into him a little bit. He's just standing his ground there and then they are going up Bernardo Silva. That's very big and brave of you. Well done. It's a real two-ventus. Manchester City supporters in their corner of the ground. They're in a sort of wedge-shaped section of seats on the far side. They're just getting their information for the end of the match. Mateusz Nunez is going to be the second change that Pep Guardiola has made tonight and Jack Grealish having been yellow carded is sprinting off the pitch and Mateusz Nunez takes his place. Three and a half minutes to go. Tell your story. He didn't go to Foden. You know you think the table is clear you need but those had such a difficult season and obviously injuries on top of that. It's almost wide ball. I'll tell you what, Walker there. He's lucky going with that. Douglas Louise fell off the pitch near the corner flag. Phil? There's a push there. And then fell over. So goal kick to Manchester City and Kyle Walker carries the ball towards the halfway line. This was very much needed this victory for Juventus who've slipped down to sixth place in the league table even though they aren't unbeaten in the Italian league this season. The one defeat they had was in the Champions League group here against Stuttgart and this has got them right back on track for Manchester City. This is quite the decline really from the recent standards in the Champions League. Listen they may well get themselves into the playoff places which is where they are currently which would mean two more matches in February but they are matches Manchester City can well do without. Absolutely. That text just comes through from a friend of mine. The tech here was great but it's over now. Maybe push that a bit there. But there's a lot of people feel that isn't there? Well I think reports of his demise. Yes. Here is Gundawand, Gundawand of Bernardo Silva. Bernardo Silva with the cross. Harlan with a touch. It bounces off Savona. He was a little fortunate there. They took it away from two of his teammates and Savona was able to clear. He sat even Harlan now. I wouldn't say disinterested but there's not really that sharpness about him here. He's been running all night and nothing has really played into him that he can attack at any point. Yeah. Apart from that one chance. Even though Manchester City have had lots of possession really relatively few chances created and when they have made good chances, D. Gregorio has kept them out. Here's Mateus Nunez. 2-0 Juventus League, 5-Live Radio Manchester on BBC Sounds. Still 2-0 to Arsenal as well. Two goals from Bukai Osaka will get you all the details from that after 10 o'clock as well. Bernardo Silva across to Gundawan who plays it back to Ruben Diaz. It's now Bruce Adolphe and two Barcelona, three Ferentoraz with the second goal of the match. Feyenoord 4-2 upon Sparta Prague now as Rico Luis plays it back to De Bruyne. De Bruyne has balled into Gundawan. Luis with a shot deflected but straight through to the goalkeeper. It actually took it closer to the goalkeeper but the Manchester City players are saying that deflection was off an arm. Both Luis and Gavardi all running towards an appealing to the referee. You will definitely check out when the ball goes out of play. As soon as his hand is going through, how far his hand was out? That's gassy. That could be given as a penalty in Champions League. Two minutes about a time to play and the AR will be looking at that. Let's see what happens when the ball rolls out of play here. I'm sure that referee Turpan will have said to Rico Luis and Gavardi all. Rico Luis has played the ball and again. So that's it. Can't be stopped now. He's taken the throw so players back underway. Let's go back to Arsenal, Conor McNamara. Arsenal are celebrating with a hope for a third goal of the evening. Two minutes to go. Arsenal three-monic on their subject of VAO review. Last touch I think went in off Tilo Kira, the former West Ham United defender, for an own goal but was in an offside decision. They're spending a long time looking at this. I don't think it's going to affect the outcome of the game anyway. But I'm still hoping that they've just made it three-nil here. Yes, confirmed the goal stands. Arsenal three, Monaco nil. So plain sailing for Arsenal tonight against Monaco who have had a very good Champions League to this point. But are now down in 15th place in the table. Here's De Bruyne. De Bruyne, two nil down Manchester City. Gundawang, Bulls played behind him, stuck out a leg at it, then Weyer goes down. I think that was a free kick it was, free kick to the eventers. We're well into added time. Just two minutes of added time to play. Manchester City are heading to another defeat here. Yeah, there was a period I would say for 15 minutes after us, before school, we thought, well, no, they're going to lift it now. British kind of faded. It's slowly but surely faded. And the question I was asking then, have they get the energy to keep that intensity up for the next 40 minutes or so? If you can do that, you'll get a goal and you could get back in this game. Unfortunately for Manchester City, they were absolutely nowhere near capable of keeping up that pace and that intensity and that quality. Milan are winning 2-1 now against Red Star Belgrade. Camille Abraham with a goal. And here is interview with Nader Manua on BBC Sounds right now. But you've entered, so getting ready to celebrate here. This will be a very noteworthy victory. And there is the final whistle here in Turin and a very satisfied Thiago Mota turns and shakes hands with Pep Guardiola, who has just seen his team fall to their seventh defeat in the last 10 matches. And now automatic qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League is probably beyond Manchester City. Yes, beyond Manchester City, I think. But it's not the biggest worry. The biggest worry is you keep on playing like that. There's a chance you don't get through. Then they should still, there'll be two games, then they should still be able to do it just about getting on points. But tonight, the saddest thing about Manchester City, tonight is, are you really shocked? And I'm not. I'm not completely shocked. The way they've been playing recently, the tiredness that they had in that group, obviously we know about the injuries, we know he's having to play players that he would rather rest, that he would rather turn around. He had nobody really to go to in the bench tonight that he thought could change the team. And at the moment, it is hell on hell for Manchester City supporters. They look to me like a team that's not capable of doing it, but they're not in the same intensity. You need to do it at the top level to win these games, week after week, or two or three times a week. In fact, they don't look like it. They simply can't. And the recipe that is for is not to win competitions. They're in real danger. Yeah, well, it was online tonight, even though this was only matchday six, but your vendors have won it. So they're up to 11 points. They've given themselves a chance of getting into that top eight. But for Manchester City, this run of awful form, this highly unexpected run that they're on, continues here. It's been another laboured performance. They've now lost six of their last seven away matches. And Juventus winning it with two second-half goals from Vlahavic and the substitute McKenney. You can hear what it's like here. Manchester City players in Maroon sloping off the pitch, and the Juventus players, they're enjoying this. The club Zebra is down there as well, a part of all of these celebrations. And the Juventus song rings out around the stadium after. Juventus two, Manchester City nil. Harry and Pat Nevin enter in watching those events unfold. And Pat, we've seen various reactions from city players over the last couple of months or so. But as they're making their way off the pitch at Juventus, they just look stunned. They look like they look almost blank in their faces. Yeah, we were talking before the game about what they need to do to change it. That was a big conversation we had. I don't think they really know. And they're walking off looking blank, confused. When you've been a team that's been successful, when you work together, you look around and every player you look at, you know you can trust. Not just to work hard, but to do really good things, to be quality things, to get you out of the hole now and again. They must walk off there, look at Shalongo, who's going to do it for us? And the only player I thought who had a positive, upbeat, lively attitude when he walked off, was probably a player who was quiet on the night and it was early Holland. He seemed to have a different kind of body language from everyone else. But the rest of it, you're right, it's almost shock, it's just a standard stand by that this nightmare just keeps on going. They're underlying it. It wasn't a good first half. Then they lost the goal when they did. Then they raised it and then you had 15 minutes of Manchester City back again. And you thought, right, okay, let's see, can you keep this going? And the answer was simple, no. You couldn't keep it going at that level. And I think that's what that look is when you're walking off. You don't want to look at yourself to some degree, but you look at the other person and think, can you do it anymore? And you never looked at them from that way before. That's a horrifying place to be for a team that could always trust each other. And that's what it looked like to me.
