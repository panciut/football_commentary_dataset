[97.40 - 101.48] P:2054.77 E:0.075491 |  temperature will cool down during this game final thought from Chris Waddle
[101.48 - 105.12] P:1982.21 E:0.088712 |  I think they're too well much say it's play basically the same system and it's
[105.12 - 109.40] P:2064.55 E:0.078512 |  basically if you win individual battle you're probably going to win the game
[109.40 - 114.32] P:2129.74 E:0.084255 |  well everything that's gone before is history England must focus only on this
[114.32 - 119.16] P:2047.63 E:0.078463 |  German team and this challenge and hope especially that Fabio Cappello's household
[119.16 - 124.28] P:2046.03 E:0.075001 |  names will do themselves justice that's really all anybody can ask it is a
[124.28 - 128.28] P:2057.83 E:0.081281 |  pity it's not the final in many ways but we're in the last 16 playing for a

[136.20 - 142.28] P:1945.06 E:0.066905 |  Defoe England will begin this game still and this doesn't help of course the
[142.28 - 147.92] P:1953.34 E:0.081965 |  players to settle down here I remember Terry Butcher always says whenever we go
[147.92 - 151.40] P:2039.23 E:0.081485 |  to big matches in the past he always says make sure your first touch is good
[151.40 - 155.76] P:1982.45 E:0.069083 |  and that's particularly what Fabio Cappello and Baldini down there Franka
[155.76 - 158.52] P:2048.40 E:0.091253 |  Baldini will be looking from these England players to settle down straight
[158.56 - 163.56] P:1976.60 E:0.067828 |  away looking for big performances in particular today from Lampard from
[163.56 - 169.60] P:2068.25 E:0.075765 |  Gerard and from Rooney here we go there Germany against England for a place in
[169.60 - 173.52] P:2034.64 E:0.088854 |  the quarterfinal of the World Cup England play the ball back into their own

[181.44 - 185.64] P:1976.15 E:0.082626 |  and Barry who launches it for the first time looking for Defoe neither of these
[185.92 - 189.20] P:1887.88 E:0.081819 |  two central defences are particularly quick on the turn England will want to
[189.20 - 192.88] P:2036.51 E:0.086235 |  try and test the Germans early on Germany clear it's still inside their half
[192.88 - 196.28] P:1944.15 E:0.085870 |  Germany yet to really get hold of the ball it's Ashley Cole now down this
[196.28 - 200.36] P:1749.95 E:0.080016 |  near side the left that's going to be some battle between Cole and Lam to the
[200.36 - 204.00] P:1905.58 E:0.082590 |  very best fullbacks in the world and England have a throw in just short of a
[204.00 - 207.16] P:1695.52 E:0.092077 |  half way left well Germany have dropped off they're not pressing they've started
[207.16 - 210.08] P:1735.07 E:0.094493 |  the tournament pressing teams obviously they respect England and they've dropped
[210.08 - 213.64] P:1904.28 E:0.082589 |  off and I think they're gonna look for counter attack and play really his first touch
[213.76 - 217.28] P:1904.34 E:0.091946 |  you look to be bundled over but the referee plays on and now Germany get their
[217.28 - 221.32] P:1900.60 E:0.082127 |  first meaningful touches until Ashley Cole closes down Erzel and they really
[221.32 - 225.84] P:1915.76 E:0.077285 |  cannot afford to give him any space at all throwing to Germany looking for

[229.60 - 233.44] P:1919.53 E:0.077943 |  Muller and in comes Ashley Cole with another good challenge against the big

[242.96 - 246.60] P:1826.55 E:0.074320 |  to us at five live maybe you're listening to us at Glastonbury in the
[246.60 - 251.72] P:1797.26 E:0.082808 |  sunshine as England now build once more from the edge of their own penalty area
[251.72 - 255.96] P:1776.93 E:0.059508 |  and it's John Terry on to Glenn Johnson over on the far side.
[255.96 - 259.72] P:1964.09 E:0.087577 |  Milner now gets his first touch wide on the England right works it in field to
[259.72 - 263.48] P:1975.43 E:0.078755 |  Defoe little flick from Defoe doesn't work and Germany now move it into the
[263.48 - 267.20] P:2011.67 E:0.084038 |  England half Erzel does doesn't control it and Gerard now finds Rooney whose
[267.20 - 271.16] P:1993.81 E:0.085415 |  control is poor and it's back on the half way line but Gerard reacts quickly
[271.20 - 275.68] P:1900.55 E:0.078289 |  and finds Ashley Cole Gerard again near side the England he'll have to play in a
[275.68 - 279.76] P:1955.83 E:0.089301 |  really disciplined way here today Gerard England can't allow Lawn to go forward
[279.76 - 284.72] P:1914.03 E:0.073885 |  with Muller it's Stephen Gerard once more just biting his time back inside the
[284.72 - 289.32] P:1871.96 E:0.072096 |  England half blaze it into feet now not controlled first time by Milner but now
[289.32 - 293.12] P:1942.77 E:0.085720 |  lamp after Defoe who doesn't hold on to it England need better touches than that
[293.12 - 296.88] P:1957.49 E:0.082710 |  nervous start perhaps from both sides as Germany bustle forward and it's an
[296.88 - 300.88] P:2010.83 E:0.080526 |  excellent touch now from Erzel faced by Matthew Upson Upson trying to take him
[300.92 - 304.12] P:1996.60 E:0.090624 |  wide over on the far side but Dalsky trying to step in anyone to give this
[304.12 - 307.84] P:1956.80 E:0.081927 |  back to David James eventually Gareth Barry happy for it to go out for a goal
[307.84 - 312.08] P:1910.82 E:0.098083 |  kick and I started okay I know there's a few first touches not you know you want
[312.08 - 315.96] P:1989.14 E:0.085647 |  it's very early in the game Erzel's had a three aims and lost it three times it's
[315.96 - 318.44] P:1685.46 E:0.114144 |  gonna take a while for these teams to settle down you've got to say England
[318.44 - 323.76] P:1892.02 E:0.082642 |  have a lot more experience than this German side David James now in the
[323.76 - 328.20] P:1926.49 E:0.087231 |  England goal of course following the error made by Robert Green players for
[328.24 - 333.08] P:1919.00 E:0.077056 |  England game settling down here then in Blomfonte and that's gone straight back
[333.08 - 338.40] P:1794.57 E:0.072529 |  into the England half once more and the ball just runs away it might actually be
[338.40 - 342.68] P:1878.73 E:0.081703 |  a throw in this by the corner flag not a goal kick so England under a little bit
[342.68 - 346.04] P:1949.95 E:0.081419 |  more pressure because Glenn Johnson has to make sure that he gets this throw
[346.04 - 353.52] P:1806.60 E:0.065259 |  accurately forward settling down in the last 16 of the World Cup England with
[353.52 - 357.40] P:1918.34 E:0.087197 |  Milner over on the far side Milner of course who played against the German
[357.44 - 362.44] P:1937.75 E:0.078912 |  under 21s in the final in Sweden last year many of those German players have
[362.44 - 366.84] P:1945.17 E:0.085613 |  graduated into the senior team including Erzel now throwing to Germany nobody's
[366.84 - 370.28] P:1884.39 E:0.093469 |  picked up Mully yet in the penalty area in goes the throw in towards Mulla
[370.28 - 373.72] P:1959.55 E:0.086505 |  John Terry heads it out England flick it towards Wayne Rooney who's a little
[373.72 - 377.32] P:1966.96 E:0.087461 |  isolated better first touch from Rooney but he's closed down by Kedira Rooney
[377.32 - 381.48] P:1924.00 E:0.082689 |  heads it forward German defenders are back it's Murdersacker giving goalkeeper
[381.48 - 385.68] P:1894.76 E:0.082059 |  Neuer his first touch relatively inexperienced Neuer in the German
[385.84 - 390.00] P:1890.36 E:0.082479 |  goal Fabio Capello already out pointing England looking to build and a break
[390.00 - 394.24] P:1978.15 E:0.094967 |  up away Rooney no the flag is off given for offside eventually over on the
[394.24 - 398.52] P:2020.18 E:0.092768 |  far side Germany pushing up Rooney can't believe the decision flag was quite late
[398.52 - 402.32] P:1899.14 E:0.088802 |  and it's a German free kick I think he's blue for the initial ball coming forward
[402.32 - 406.20] P:1893.60 E:0.095997 |  not for long playing it forward I think he's actually flagged when the ball came
[406.20 - 409.72] P:1857.36 E:0.091649 |  forward from Upsons header nothing people thought it was their larmel
[409.72 - 413.16] P:2056.10 E:0.088971 |  played it so he did but he'd already flagged now Schveinsteiger looking for
[413.16 - 417.60] P:2021.80 E:0.094645 |  a run from Erzl danger here for England Erzl shot saved by James's legs and the
[417.60 - 422.28] P:1942.85 E:0.094688 |  ball goes away for a corner kick nobody really tracking Erzl there and on the
[422.28 - 426.76] P:2059.21 E:0.088966 |  break David James saving England with his feet and it's a corner to Germany
[426.76 - 431.28] P:1876.17 E:0.092890 |  far side good place by Erzl put a good ball by Schveinsteiger and he just England
[431.28 - 436.96] P:1895.44 E:0.080552 |  a great fortune it was on his right foot not his favorite left so we see
[436.96 - 440.80] P:2026.91 E:0.089199 |  Boateng the full back going into the England penalty area he's standing
[440.84 - 445.08] P:2031.67 E:0.086165 |  right on the goal line Germany then with this first corner kick of the game
[445.08 - 449.72] P:2010.59 E:0.084696 |  here over on the far side the left Germany nil England nil now Boateng
[449.72 - 453.80] P:2040.43 E:0.083537 |  backs away and James holds it beautifully good catch confidently held there by
[453.80 - 458.36] P:1990.17 E:0.079921 |  James reassuring and then a big high clearance downfield but it should be
[458.36 - 461.88] P:1968.75 E:0.086422 |  Friedrichs ball not a very good first touch for him though it almost ran to
[461.88 - 466.32] P:1921.14 E:0.075607 |  Rooney on the halfway line Boateng got in ahead of Rooney and now Schveinsteiger
[466.32 - 470.60] P:1846.98 E:0.076538 |  who's such a smooth passer of the ball try to find Muller England struggling to
[470.60 - 473.12] P:1894.63 E:0.095733 |  get this one away at the moment now it's out of play and Schveinsteiger
[473.12 - 478.08] P:1880.01 E:0.081557 |  starting to step up a gear here in the match Schveinsteiger's throw to Kedira
[478.08 - 481.68] P:1826.88 E:0.080052 |  who won't venture very far forward at all Boateng had to hit that one quickly
[481.68 - 486.24] P:1817.47 E:0.071748 |  and it's an offside against Erzl and England have a free kick and we played
[486.24 - 490.04] P:1861.60 E:0.085074 |  just over five minutes of the first half nil nil here in Blumfonte it's very
[490.04 - 492.60] P:1571.08 E:0.105226 |  front to get them in at no where you can really put the foot on it a lot of
[492.60 - 498.28] P:1852.20 E:0.074246 |  challenges going in and you get here so the only chance of the game James like
[498.28 - 501.84] P:1803.67 E:0.090913 |  the way that he confidently handled that one though just a few moments ago all
[501.84 - 506.92] P:1861.40 E:0.078976 |  in yellow away to our right fantastic support here once more for the England
[506.92 - 510.56] P:1836.11 E:0.086540 |  team but also the Germans getting fantastic support away to our left
[510.56 - 514.28] P:1848.48 E:0.081616 |  that's a poor ball from James downfield and Fabio Cotellan won't be happy with
[514.28 - 517.52] P:1837.10 E:0.080721 |  that because remember him getting Joe Hart a hard time recently when he wasn't
[517.52 - 521.68] P:1857.73 E:0.084523 |  able to be more constructive with his distribution he's now actually looking
[521.68 - 524.88] P:1866.25 E:0.090222 |  across at the England bench as well James almost as if to say well what can I
[524.92 - 528.56] P:1920.82 E:0.083154 |  do there because nobody was really offering Germany bill now from inside
[528.56 - 533.68] P:1896.75 E:0.079483 |  their own half with the captain love such a consistent performer rarely misses a
[533.68 - 537.52] P:1943.75 E:0.086952 |  German game ball swept into the England half Glenn Johnson's there but Terry
[537.52 - 541.92] P:1995.48 E:0.075498 |  takes responsibility the ball's on the halfway line Barry now trying to turn
[541.92 - 545.64] P:1907.50 E:0.085633 |  with Kedira that's a ball out of play though from Barry lacking the control
[545.64 - 549.64] P:1910.13 E:0.080443 |  it's towards Fabio Cotellan and Germany just starting to settle down here have
[549.64 - 554.28] P:1774.96 E:0.090421 |  a throw in nobody settled yet Mike they're still obviously looking for it to
[554.32 - 558.72] P:1828.99 E:0.079782 |  get the foot on it string four or five passes a minute live up there
[558.72 - 563.36] P:1808.14 E:0.093537 |  I took the red there but England no Russian everything instead of just putting
[563.36 - 568.08] P:1874.01 E:0.077971 |  the foot on the ball out three or four passes Schweinsteiger nice change of pace
[568.08 - 571.20] P:1837.00 E:0.087476 |  there plays the ball on to Miller Schweinsteiger always making himself
[571.20 - 575.08] P:1815.01 E:0.086739 |  available little trick there to get away from Defoe starting to pull the string
[575.08 - 579.08] P:1880.24 E:0.079558 |  Schweinsteiger finding down this near side Ersel bit of German possession now
[579.08 - 583.04] P:1849.59 E:0.080661 |  Lawn infield nicely played to Kedira back again to Lawn Lawn's venturing
[583.08 - 586.28] P:1940.60 E:0.091727 |  forward for the first time Ashley Cole hasn't got it away and the ball breaks to
[586.28 - 590.64] P:1917.02 E:0.085604 |  Ersel down the right hand side Ersel now up against Ashley Cole the ball now
[590.64 - 594.72] P:1954.96 E:0.086350 |  possibly may get swept in from Lawn and Ersel's beating the offside trap Ersel's
[594.72 - 599.44] P:1976.44 E:0.086913 |  ball in but it's waiting for it is Upson and England clear but now Rooney on
[599.44 - 603.68] P:2001.98 E:0.091085 |  the break for England Rooney taking the ball towards the half wayline Schweinsteiger
[603.68 - 607.60] P:1913.67 E:0.075574 |  approaches him Rooney has to give it back to Glenn Johnson Johnson now in
[607.60 - 612.08] P:1913.90 E:0.083692 |  field to Barry Barry crosses the half wayline Milner's available Milner up
[612.12 - 616.00] P:1933.03 E:0.087736 |  against Boateng Milner turning with Boateng but I think Boateng is going to be
[616.00 - 620.52] P:1868.15 E:0.082251 |  too quick for him here by the corner flag and does well to avoid putting the
[620.52 - 623.88] P:1997.44 E:0.082978 |  ball out of play Germany keeping possession neatly and then Boateng hits a
[623.88 - 628.08] P:1899.94 E:0.074145 |  high ball back to the half wayline where Terry takes it on the chest John Terry
[628.08 - 633.20] P:1791.27 E:0.070229 |  of England on to Lampard who's struggling to make early impact here Upson of
[633.20 - 636.88] P:1894.78 E:0.085835 |  England nil nil here in Blumfonte Geroz just gone into the centre for the
[636.88 - 641.28] P:1890.61 E:0.077011 |  moment Geroz turns and then hits a high one to the far side and that won't find
[641.32 - 645.80] P:1840.12 E:0.072421 |  Milner the intention was right couldn't quite get the accuracy though and it's
[645.80 - 649.24] P:1699.62 E:0.091693 |  the throw to Germany left hand side. Geroz actually his movement's been
[649.24 - 651.92] P:1735.94 E:0.097703 |  excellent he's wanting to get involved he's wanting the ball he's just over here
[651.92 - 657.44] P:1700.49 E:0.069427 |  a couple of passes there's no rhythm to the game no pattern yet. Grant Taylor's
[657.44 - 661.16] P:1780.68 E:0.082450 |  with us we'll hear from him shortly when we played about 10 minutes it's nil nil
[661.16 - 665.24] P:1901.96 E:0.081534 |  as this game continues just to settle down and now Rooney trying to judge the
[665.24 - 668.88] P:1894.73 E:0.075876 |  bouncing ball against Friedrich Friedrich's header away still with
[668.92 - 672.00] P:1816.00 E:0.071005 |  England though and that Johnson's overplayed it and that's going to be a
[672.00 - 680.16] P:1766.80 E:0.060818 |  goal kick to Neuer nil nil and really neither side has an initiative yet Chris.
[680.16 - 683.12] P:1727.58 E:0.095246 |  No there's a lot of nerves obviously there's a lot of hate about this game
[683.12 - 686.12] P:1477.40 E:0.098649 |  isn't there always is and then nobody settled down yet there's part I'm gonna
[686.12 - 688.80] P:1926.83 E:0.103664 |  see the chance from here so where it was on his right foot rather than his left
[688.80 - 694.80] P:1923.03 E:0.067686 |  far from that nothing happening. So the German clearance into the England
[694.80 - 697.68] P:1860.84 E:0.096045 |  half Muller of course is tall down the right hand side he heads the ball on
[697.72 - 700.68] P:1870.00 E:0.095297 |  Terry has to be watchful here against closer ball back in the England area
[700.68 - 705.20] P:1909.49 E:0.072785 |  out comes David James quickly but they will always be a handful Germany when
[705.20 - 709.96] P:1846.89 E:0.077560 |  they get forward with closer one short of 50 international goals Muller the
[709.96 - 713.80] P:1832.36 E:0.081025 |  youngster down the right hand side and of course the threat of Podolski on the
[713.80 - 718.12] P:1862.68 E:0.082046 |  left the Enigma Podolski ball into the German half headed away by Friedrich and
[718.12 - 722.16] P:1992.82 E:0.083932 |  now Ursul again finding too much space for me in midfield Ursul's ball onto
[722.16 - 726.08] P:1770.92 E:0.073178 |  Podolski but well read by John Terry England must get tighter on Ursul now
[726.12 - 730.12] P:1900.18 E:0.083905 |  Frank Lampard with a good ball to Steven Gerard in the centre circle Gerard
[730.12 - 734.00] P:1918.10 E:0.078290 |  trying to pick a pass here for Defoe out though will come Neuer Defoe can't reach
[734.00 - 737.88] P:1865.71 E:0.080191 |  that and let's get some thoughts now from Graham Taylor Graham. Well the game is still
[737.88 - 742.28] P:1723.85 E:0.073818 |  not yet settled down but Mike you've taken the words out of my mouth the one
[742.28 - 747.20] P:1866.11 E:0.088941 |  thing I'm concerned about is Ursul you know nobody I'm not saying he should be
[747.20 - 751.20] P:1861.28 E:0.087307 |  man marked but he wonders about that he's been in and David James had to make
[751.20 - 755.32] P:1889.64 E:0.083670 |  the save I'm just a bit concerned about the freedom that he's actually getting
[755.68 - 760.40] P:1905.06 E:0.090213 |  well he must have figured high in the discussions on the game as now
[760.40 - 764.64] P:1899.72 E:0.089968 |  Milner gets the ball for England Ursul they always have problems England
[764.64 - 768.36] P:1940.15 E:0.083395 |  picking up these players who play just behind the strikers and now England a
[768.36 - 771.36] P:1983.63 E:0.088299 |  little congested in midfield that needs some wits here Barry plays it down the
[771.36 - 774.96] P:1970.83 E:0.087721 |  centre Milner turns into trouble and here comes the break now with Ursul
[774.96 - 779.68] P:1976.76 E:0.086321 |  once more and Podolski it's Podolski for Germany left players left and right
[779.68 - 783.56] P:1998.93 E:0.086113 |  Podolski tries a shot brilliant block though from England and from John Terry
[783.80 - 787.00] P:1905.09 E:0.080550 |  and now they look to clear on the edge of the penalty area. Well there's a classic
[787.00 - 791.32] P:1708.84 E:0.097244 |  in Ursul and Podolski double help and out the midfield but the ball spills out
[791.32 - 793.84] P:1748.36 E:0.101181 |  and everybody had gone forward and really Podolski should have rolled
[793.84 - 798.20] P:1935.34 E:0.075176 |  Ursul back in. Listen to five live ten minutes gone in the game between England
[798.20 - 801.80] P:1909.26 E:0.080862 |  and Germany in the last 16 of the World Cup here in South Africa in Blumfontaine
[801.80 - 805.24] P:1868.03 E:0.081348 |  and right in the heart of South Africa it's Nildale and now Rooney finding
[805.24 - 808.28] P:1964.03 E:0.088354 |  Barry and going for the return ball. Rooney immediately two or three German
[808.28 - 811.44] P:1985.91 E:0.079682 |  players around him waste it hits it straight at the full back boating
[811.80 - 816.44] P:2019.42 E:0.082476 |  Germany don't build again and England now have an opportunity with Ashley Cole
[816.44 - 821.92] P:1732.07 E:0.068964 |  down below us on this near side the left. Pretty cagey opening as you would have
[821.92 - 825.84] P:1881.77 E:0.079872 |  expected really and it's Gareth Barry now. England looking for accuracy with
[825.84 - 830.40] P:1790.84 E:0.084738 |  their passing. England fans we can hear now particularly the fans behind David
[830.40 - 834.72] P:1827.28 E:0.081682 |  Jones's goal. It's Frank Lampard now hasn't ventured very far forward so far.
[834.72 - 839.20] P:1886.03 E:0.080642 |  England do need to get tighter though on Ursul as now it's Defoe for England.
[839.48 - 843.36] P:2025.42 E:0.084562 |  Defoe wriggles the ball to the far side of the field and Johnson halfway inside
[843.36 - 847.52] P:1934.55 E:0.083387 |  Germany's half. Johnson now down the line to Milner. Germany appealed for offside
[847.52 - 851.32] P:1898.07 E:0.080673 |  not given Milner now swings it in with his left foot looking for Defoe. Powerful
[851.32 - 855.48] P:1873.57 E:0.078634 |  header away by Murdersaker. Barry's trying to close down this time on Ursul
[855.48 - 860.28] P:1807.16 E:0.074072 |  but Schweinsteiger mopping up once more now knocks it to this near side and it's
[860.28 - 865.28] P:1784.16 E:0.069213 |  headed down neatly by Muller to his Bayern Munich teammate the captain Larm.
[865.36 - 869.52] P:1889.89 E:0.078998 |  Larm against Gerard good ball in field to Schweinsteiger this seem to be finding
[869.52 - 873.28] P:1806.76 E:0.084270 |  room here and that's another good ball onto Ursul and England really not getting
[873.28 - 877.00] P:1910.60 E:0.078245 |  tight enough on him. They turn the ball to the far side the field and the tall
[877.00 - 882.28] P:1754.44 E:0.073940 |  Boateng. Boateng now for Podolski who swingered across from left to right it's
[882.28 - 886.20] P:1837.93 E:0.089051 |  a fantastic ball. Muller though doesn't control it and Ashley Cole goes in really
[886.20 - 890.16] P:1916.58 E:0.086723 |  well left for England. Muller's tumbled over with an alleged injury and Frank
[890.16 - 894.60] P:1836.70 E:0.081625 |  Lampard spittingly puts the ball out of play and Germany will have to give the
[894.60 - 897.52] P:1820.62 E:0.092679 |  ball back now from this right. It was a fair challenge it was a very hard
[897.52 - 901.80] P:1852.19 E:0.082045 |  challenge though Muller just bad first touch which we've seen a lot. He's caught
[901.80 - 905.44] P:1639.42 E:0.086546 |  slightly on the ankle but he's got up now and Germany will throw the ball back to
[905.44 - 910.64] P:1906.94 E:0.061694 |  England. Stephen Gerrard's just getting a word or two there from Stuart Pierce who
[910.64 - 916.12] P:1829.23 E:0.074391 |  played of course with Chris against the German side the last time these two
[916.12 - 921.40] P:1836.11 E:0.073343 |  teams met in the World Cup itself in the tournament of course the last time the
[921.52 - 925.52] P:1885.05 E:0.075557 |  side's met in a World Cup game a qualifying game was the famous 5-1 in
[925.52 - 931.76] P:1755.79 E:0.059181 |  Munich for England Michael Owen and all. Now it's Upson for England in this
[931.76 - 937.12] P:1832.90 E:0.073596 |  unchanged lineup 12 minutes gone in the first half five live Upson decides to
[937.12 - 940.28] P:2011.79 E:0.090061 |  give the ball back now to James in the England goal. England yet to create
[940.28 - 945.44] P:1888.06 E:0.070861 |  anything here. We've had an opening for Ursel for Germany saved by David James.
[945.44 - 951.04] P:1927.69 E:0.066444 |  Barry England trying to pass and move here. Barry held up by Ursel plays it
[951.08 - 955.88] P:1856.78 E:0.076707 |  square to Lampard. England looking for some momentum here Lampard inside the
[955.88 - 960.96] P:1858.82 E:0.077138 |  centre circle Gerrard taps the ball back to Barry now it's Ashley Cole just below
[960.96 - 965.72] P:1837.96 E:0.074959 |  us on the left hand side back again to Barry Barry comes inside Muller Barry
[965.72 - 969.72] P:2007.23 E:0.089245 |  now for Stephen Gerrard wide on the left so many German players working back it
[969.72 - 973.20] P:1952.05 E:0.081892 |  may may break here for Ashley Cole now it's a good interception from Philipp
[973.20 - 976.96] P:1823.18 E:0.084644 |  Lam ball spins back towards the German penalty area and it's going to be a goal
[976.96 - 979.84] P:1805.96 E:0.085757 |  kick now to Neuer a little bit better there from England. Well that gives them a
[979.84 - 984.16] P:1588.51 E:0.094167 |  little bit of confidence that was what seven eight maybe nine passes and Ashley
[984.16 - 987.44] P:1848.75 E:0.099737 |  Cole first time he's ventured forward but unfortunate with a challenge off
[987.44 - 991.00] P:1926.34 E:0.083590 |  Larm but you know they've just got to keep the ball it's just growing
[991.00 - 993.56] P:1689.92 E:0.097025 |  confidence what is you say they haven't created anything they haven't put
[993.56 - 999.68] P:1793.63 E:0.071852 |  anything in the box yet. Larm so far no real breakaways from him down the right
[999.68 - 1004.16] P:1792.50 E:0.075828 |  hand side and Friedrich who's really a fullback but he's now playing alongside
[1004.16 - 1008.16] P:1835.85 E:0.090660 |  Mertzacker in the way that Metzeld used long-worn now from Boateng Upsons let it
[1008.16 - 1011.40] P:1865.25 E:0.091255 |  sail over his head Ashley Cole will have to follow this one towards the dead
[1011.40 - 1014.72] P:1855.36 E:0.071153 |  ball line closest there runs into the corner flag and it's going to be an
[1014.72 - 1018.84] P:1768.81 E:0.074865 |  England throw by the corner flag closer reluctant to give the ball back a little
[1018.84 - 1024.12] P:1856.81 E:0.076969 |  petulantly there to Ashley Cole. Throw into England with nearly 15 minutes gone
[1024.12 - 1030.60] P:1746.72 E:0.068447 |  in the first half Germany nil England nil here in Blumfonte. England throwing to be
[1030.60 - 1036.72] P:1740.52 E:0.067694 |  taken by Ashley Cole taking his time making sure he gets it right Cole's
[1036.76 - 1040.76] P:1961.23 E:0.083848 |  throwing doesn't fly as Paul throw in really Gerard scoops the ball to the
[1040.76 - 1045.00] P:1997.55 E:0.074434 |  half wayline Defoe gets a strong challenge from Friedrich Defoe yet to
[1045.00 - 1048.60] P:1875.33 E:0.086499 |  really settle into the game as now Kedira plays the ball back in Germany
[1048.60 - 1052.24] P:1848.21 E:0.076240 |  regroup on the half wayline it's Schweinsteiger if in doubt give it to him
[1052.24 - 1057.92] P:1731.08 E:0.076358 |  Muller now going inside this time finding Larm down the German right high
[1057.92 - 1061.36] P:2008.75 E:0.092641 |  ball in it should be David James's and it is it's a beautiful catch once more
[1061.36 - 1066.16] P:1961.13 E:0.084557 |  and James throws out well that's better distribution Lampard now Rooney and Defoe
[1066.20 - 1070.04] P:1960.30 E:0.081761 |  ahead of him players trying to join Lampard in midfield Rooney takes it on
[1070.04 - 1072.76] P:1868.10 E:0.090471 |  the edge of the center circle there's nobody down the left hand side for him
[1072.76 - 1075.96] P:1977.41 E:0.081964 |  to give it to instead he gives it to Gerard and now Gerard sweeps it to the
[1075.96 - 1080.44] P:1878.19 E:0.080138 |  far side Johnson and Milner are there Defoe's waiting in the area Johnson
[1080.44 - 1084.16] P:1858.99 E:0.082602 |  holds and then gives it to Miller crossing opportunity here for England it's
[1084.16 - 1088.00] P:2006.09 E:0.088474 |  Johnson again it's taking a long time now the cross goes in and it's a poor one
[1088.00 - 1091.24] P:1912.63 E:0.081297 |  really and the ball just bounces up easily for Neuer in the German goal
[1091.24 - 1094.32] P:1570.45 E:0.104582 |  hesitating about putting a ball in the box and had three in there didn't it
[1094.36 - 1097.80] P:2001.90 E:0.097817 |  same three three redfield you're the goal again Muller here comes the danger now
[1097.80 - 1101.08] P:1988.27 E:0.087121 |  from Thomas Muller once more down the right hand side England trying to track
[1101.08 - 1105.36] P:1920.90 E:0.087827 |  back it's played into closer back again to Muller Mullers played a wasteful ball
[1105.36 - 1108.60] P:1947.73 E:0.087746 |  though and although the Germans keep possession they lose a bit of their
[1108.60 - 1112.80] P:1817.94 E:0.072906 |  momentum for Dalski on to Schweinsteiger time for all the England players now to
[1112.80 - 1117.80] P:1771.46 E:0.073377 |  come back behind the ball the Schweinsteiger finds Larm's done that so many times in
[1117.80 - 1122.96] P:1830.82 E:0.069532 |  his career Ursula again hugging the right touch line back again to Larm and in
[1123.00 - 1127.20] P:1909.06 E:0.086103 |  the field to Schweinsteiger Germany nil England nil and the well cop here in
[1127.20 - 1131.20] P:1941.31 E:0.081427 |  Blumfonte now it's Kedira Germany looking to try and spring the traffic Kedira
[1131.20 - 1135.84] P:1981.95 E:0.081382 |  shot is really poor into the England fans David James watches it sail wide and
[1135.84 - 1138.80] P:1805.08 E:0.088297 |  high and it's going to be a goal kick you've got to say though I think when
[1138.80 - 1141.72] P:1764.46 E:0.105062 |  Germany go forward that their movements a lot better than England's at the moment
[1141.72 - 1146.16] P:1780.39 E:0.088916 |  you know Muller's running in say then Ursula comes out way there's a lot of
[1146.16 - 1150.84] P:1904.10 E:0.079911 |  interchanges in play and there's not a lot of pressure on the ball in the
[1150.88 - 1155.12] P:1990.00 E:0.092813 |  cricket later scored old truck at England are 28 for one with 42 overs left
[1155.12 - 1160.92] P:1977.62 E:0.085119 |  meeting 213 to win the match and the series against Australia here Germany nil
[1160.92 - 1166.08] P:1906.86 E:0.081399 |  England nil in the World Cup England yet to really threaten anything at Noia's
[1166.08 - 1173.28] P:1903.37 E:0.067289 |  goal cautious start from England the only alarm really I suppose the freedom
[1173.28 - 1176.80] P:2043.43 E:0.095773 |  occasionally that Ursul's getting and now England look to Rooney Rooney reaches
[1176.80 - 1180.44] P:1982.90 E:0.086597 |  the ball does well to keep it in and now here's Rooney's chance to attack the
[1180.48 - 1184.40] P:1884.44 E:0.082581 |  German defenders he's up against Murdersacka Rooney now not a good ball
[1184.40 - 1188.92] P:1930.53 E:0.081397 |  at all headed away by boating the left back of Germany and then a foul given
[1188.92 - 1193.00] P:1832.52 E:0.079626 |  against Johnson on Padovsky he's one of the England players by the way Johnson
[1193.00 - 1197.48] P:1771.30 E:0.075697 |  threatened with suspension Milner and Gerard being the other players on the
[1197.48 - 1201.40] P:1868.21 E:0.086261 |  yellow cards Muller's just getting a drink but also some words from his manager
[1201.40 - 1205.04] P:1823.10 E:0.082747 |  down there as Germany now crossed the half-way line playing from left to right
[1205.04 - 1209.52] P:1941.56 E:0.075766 |  Schweinsteiger foot on the ball surrounded by red England shirts and he's
[1209.56 - 1213.24] P:1943.51 E:0.084874 |  given it away and now England find Defoe looking for a change of pace here to
[1213.24 - 1217.56] P:1955.19 E:0.087090 |  vote Defoe for England all on his own the lampard takes over it maybe running
[1217.56 - 1220.80] P:1974.17 E:0.094164 |  into trouble here lampard goes down he's looking for a free kick and he's won it
[1220.80 - 1225.24] P:1953.07 E:0.088036 |  but generous that I think 17 and a half minutes gone but a chance for England
[1225.24 - 1229.08] P:1925.42 E:0.106516 |  that's a good opportunity I should have a tune you are 25 yards middle of the goal
[1229.08 - 1233.84] P:1963.31 E:0.098803 |  just slightly to the right but yeah yeah front lampard gets challenge goes down in
[1233.84 - 1238.32] P:1891.04 E:0.092776 |  the referee blows a lot of legs in that tackle it's an opportunity of a lampard
[1238.32 - 1241.56] P:2004.79 E:0.094310 |  he had to strike the ball well there was nothing on there for England lampard
[1241.56 - 1246.00] P:1933.42 E:0.084213 |  wasn't going anywhere the Germans really didn't need to do that but here's
[1246.00 - 1251.64] P:1908.51 E:0.081048 |  England's first opportunity to make Neuer in the German goldmaker save at the
[1251.64 - 1258.40] P:1715.53 E:0.071683 |  moment he's standing by his left post now Frank Lampard aware what these balls
[1258.40 - 1262.32] P:2045.90 E:0.088541 |  can do here these Jabalani balls can Frank Lampard strike England in front
[1262.32 - 1267.40] P:1966.31 E:0.088732 |  here in the last 16 of the World Cup he's 25 yards away from Neuer's goal
[1267.44 - 1272.16] P:1984.08 E:0.082126 |  it's pretty central and here comes a Chelsea man lampard goes straight into
[1272.16 - 1276.28] P:1920.56 E:0.084438 |  the German wall opportunity wasted it's now back inside the center circle and
[1276.28 - 1281.16] P:1936.90 E:0.084879 |  Ashley Cole now does well for England Cole on to Defoe and to Rooney Rooney's
[1281.16 - 1285.00] P:1997.08 E:0.088843 |  giving it away poor play from Wayne Rooney and Germany now looking to counter
[1285.00 - 1289.20] P:1766.21 E:0.080916 |  attack 18 and a half minutes gone nil nil here in Blumfontein and that was a
[1289.20 - 1292.72] P:1864.54 E:0.086822 |  big moment for Frank Lampard and it really was weekly delivered the free
[1292.72 - 1297.00] P:1955.89 E:0.073839 |  kick and it's Ashley Cole again now down the England left into the center
[1297.04 - 1300.24] P:1853.84 E:0.083777 |  circle for Lampard England haven't got the width over on the right-hand side at
[1300.24 - 1305.12] P:1877.77 E:0.079046 |  the moment so Gerard steps in Lampard and Gerard exchange passes then the ball to
[1305.12 - 1308.28] P:2048.76 E:0.089401 |  the far side almost found its way through to Johnson it was well defended by
[1308.28 - 1311.68] P:1958.65 E:0.083935 |  Germany England now need to put a bit of pressure on this German defense and
[1311.68 - 1315.44] P:1925.80 E:0.088536 |  they have a throw in for Glenn Johnson to take wide on the right Gerard's gone
[1315.44 - 1318.32] P:1976.57 E:0.088229 |  across for the first time to the right across came in took a deflection I
[1318.32 - 1321.84] P:1874.40 E:0.073646 |  thought and it what it hasn't taken a deflection because it's a goal kick in
[1321.84 - 1324.84] P:1769.32 E:0.107114 |  on the court now James Miller Gerard sorry you've volleyed it across the goal
[1325.80 - 1329.56] P:1697.86 E:0.098424 |  and it was too much pace on for anybody but I mean you dominate position
[1329.56 - 1332.08] P:1791.53 E:0.091930 |  they're winning a lot of challenges in the middle of the park we're trying to
[1332.08 - 1335.40] P:1821.66 E:0.091461 |  push Jeremy back Jeremy are quite happy to get behind the ball and play on the
[1335.40 - 1338.32] P:1935.77 E:0.081147 |  counter attack just got to replay the free kick one of the German players very
[1338.32 - 1342.60] P:1849.79 E:0.078800 |  close to using his hand there to stop that free kick but away we go Germany
[1342.60 - 1345.92] P:1977.36 E:0.096995 |  nil England no Terry's out of position he's lost the ball Upson against closer
[1345.92 - 1349.04] P:2044.97 E:0.097063 |  closer going in oh to score for Germany
[1349.80 - 1355.24] P:2012.36 E:0.101854 |  there is one closer punishes John Terry and Matthew Upson right down the heart
[1355.24 - 1360.92] P:1941.13 E:0.092520 |  of England's defense and scores his 50th international goal and it's Germany
[1360.92 - 1364.64] P:1965.47 E:0.107991 |  one England no I've got to say you don't see many goals like that unless you
[1364.64 - 1368.24] P:1896.96 E:0.098501 |  watch them the morning pub football that is just a big punt down the middle of
[1368.24 - 1371.76] P:1942.97 E:0.099235 |  the field what are the two cent halves thinking about and where's David James
[1371.76 - 1376.72] P:1831.63 E:0.093555 |  when it comes over the top that is an unbelievable simple goal and you talk
[1376.76 - 1381.04] P:1811.96 E:0.090944 |  about a world cup it's just a big point from the goalkeeper the two cent are
[1381.04 - 1384.20] P:1925.32 E:0.096689 |  so not alive they're not working each other and not covering each other and
[1384.20 - 1388.20] P:1893.41 E:0.091225 |  give closer credit he didn't give up on it David James back pedals he's brave
[1388.20 - 1391.60] P:1884.50 E:0.098277 |  closer and he pushes it into the bottom corner they always say to his right foot
[1391.60 - 1397.64] P:1911.08 E:0.077732 |  terrible goal to give away what a wretched moment for England defensively
[1397.64 - 1403.28] P:1930.98 E:0.089161 |  all it was was a clearance downfield from the German goalkeeper Neuer Terry let
[1403.32 - 1410.00] P:1963.76 E:0.084731 |  it run on Upson was then confused by closer James didn't come and made it
[1410.00 - 1415.08] P:1928.61 E:0.088361 |  very simple really for a striker of Miroslav Klosos quality to give Germany
[1415.08 - 1418.84] P:1949.11 E:0.091494 |  the lead and now Schveinsteiger stolen the ball away from Frank Lampard and
[1418.84 - 1423.08] P:2028.58 E:0.097929 |  it's on to Ersel and there's danger here for England as John Terry tries to close
[1423.08 - 1428.16] P:1929.98 E:0.083548 |  down Ersel the Germans leading through closer closer can hardly get in the
[1428.16 - 1432.24] P:1957.02 E:0.088367 |  Bayern Munich team as the cross comes in once more and Muller's header should be
[1432.28 - 1436.52] P:1946.76 E:0.080673 |  saved by James he hasn't been able to be a regular starter for Bayern Munich but
[1436.52 - 1440.32] P:1983.59 E:0.091248 |  here for Germany on his 99th appearance he's now scored a half a century of
[1440.32 - 1445.00] P:1784.88 E:0.087154 |  goals only Gert Muller has managed that before I can't believe what I saw there
[1445.00 - 1448.84] P:1715.63 E:0.098780 |  mate I'm sorry you know England totally control the game really they've won a lot
[1448.84 - 1451.68] P:1841.58 E:0.092713 |  of challenges we'll be worried about the counter attack that wasn't a counter
[1451.68 - 1455.60] P:1764.07 E:0.092204 |  attack was a set-piece clearance which has got them in on one long ball it's
[1455.60 - 1461.20] P:1927.79 E:0.080666 |  pub football and of course that now will help this German team to settle down and
[1461.24 - 1464.80] P:1937.79 E:0.096427 |  England need to put more pressure on the defenders as Defoe tries to go forward
[1464.80 - 1470.08] P:1942.63 E:0.077359 |  but it's easily met by Friedrich in the air and now Germany clear through Lawn
[1470.08 - 1473.28] P:1959.99 E:0.085275 |  wasn't a great clearance but England need to get hold of this in midfield now
[1473.28 - 1478.92] P:1832.02 E:0.073057 |  they were caught out right down the centre Terry Upsen and then James and
[1478.92 - 1484.52] P:1815.30 E:0.083500 |  Kloser finished easily Lampard now looking for Rooney hasn't been cleared by
[1484.52 - 1489.72] P:1877.51 E:0.080226 |  Merdezakka but he doesn't need to anyway the ball's gone away for a goal kick to
[1489.76 - 1494.84] P:1909.82 E:0.085428 |  Germany they scored from a goal kick it's the halfway point of the first half
[1494.84 - 1498.92] P:1837.52 E:0.088494 |  England were just starting to settle down here now they need to climb two or
[1498.92 - 1504.56] P:1763.17 E:0.069403 |  three gears here because they're trailing 1-0 and here's Alan Green. Graham what
[1504.56 - 1509.60] P:1930.40 E:0.083157 |  did you make of that? Well as Mr Beckenbar says kicking rush football the goalkeeper
[1509.60 - 1514.20] P:1898.18 E:0.082571 |  kicked it long closer rushes after it ball at the end of the internet it was
[1514.24 - 1519.92] P:1947.24 E:0.081055 |  shocking defending you get there is no excuse for that the two centre-backs to a
[1519.92 - 1525.92] P:1876.24 E:0.074775 |  degree the keeper but the two centre-backs all over the place it's I mean
[1525.92 - 1529.92] P:1896.15 E:0.086922 |  Chris has just described it as football and I understand totally that's what you
[1529.92 - 1535.84] P:1868.13 E:0.086124 |  see on the Sunday on the Sunday Park sorry Graham I didn't drop the
[1535.84 - 1539.92] P:1835.76 E:0.087853 |  Germany were on the attack there actually I blame Terry initially and then I
[1539.96 - 1545.16] P:1918.69 E:0.081118 |  thought it was compounded ratchedly by James failing to advance here's Rooney
[1545.16 - 1550.08] P:1974.72 E:0.083291 |  we've had a stinker so far and that just shows what a stinker he's having because
[1550.08 - 1553.84] P:1756.68 E:0.086744 |  he just belts that high and into the crowd I can't remember him finding a
[1553.84 - 1557.32] P:1848.80 E:0.095018 |  colleague with a fast way in Rooney. No he struggled against today he struggled
[1557.32 - 1561.20] P:1966.90 E:0.103217 |  at last few games he just doesn't look himself he's to control his awareness
[1561.20 - 1564.80] P:1870.47 E:0.087206 |  everything about Wayne Rooney what you expect it's not happening this tournament
[1564.80 - 1569.28] P:1784.25 E:0.083531 |  so far and we need him in a game like this. Well we're just seeing a replay of
[1569.32 - 1574.16] P:1903.33 E:0.081795 |  David James reaction to the goal he should look at a mirror as well. Terry and
[1574.16 - 1580.40] P:1815.46 E:0.074075 |  James primarily at fault for that debacle England nil Germany won and England
[1580.40 - 1585.52] P:1683.03 E:0.074573 |  have had not a single effort on goal so far not that Germany be that much better
[1585.52 - 1592.04] P:1749.25 E:0.073614 |  Gerrard unlucky not to get the ball back off Kedira it clicks into the air
[1592.04 - 1597.28] P:1782.30 E:0.078860 |  Johnson with the prurer defensive header and here's Podolski to Urzel
[1597.28 - 1601.12] P:1846.70 E:0.085870 |  Urzel shooting from long range it hits the gold score closer and that's behind
[1601.12 - 1606.84] P:1919.21 E:0.073505 |  for a goal kick. By the way I'm just remembering what I saw this referee not
[1606.84 - 1611.80] P:1883.83 E:0.079799 |  not refereeing again but I saw him at Port Elizabeth Airport with these mates
[1611.80 - 1616.52] P:1881.30 E:0.083184 |  you know the two assistants of the fourth official and he was exceedingly noisy
[1616.52 - 1624.08] P:1839.89 E:0.072125 |  over a game of cards and couldn't give a stop who he was annoying. Anyway more
[1624.12 - 1628.56] P:1831.56 E:0.084310 |  annoyed with the goal nearly 25 minutes played England trail 1 nil here to
[1628.56 - 1634.56] P:1818.07 E:0.069865 |  Germany in Blumfonte Milner back to the errant Terry and left for Johnson and
[1634.56 - 1638.84] P:1740.39 E:0.085037 |  here's Lampard once more you know you talk about the key figures Lampard not
[1638.84 - 1642.44] P:1593.61 E:0.091695 |  involved in the game Rooney when he is involved giving the ball away here's
[1642.44 - 1648.60] P:1819.14 E:0.074284 |  Barry he's certainly properly involved in the match he finds Terry Terry away
[1648.60 - 1652.56] P:1830.65 E:0.080134 |  toward the far side England right nice chip pass to Johnson into Milner
[1653.20 - 1658.68] P:1862.89 E:0.078696 |  under hits it to Johnson somehow gets to the full back and now it's with Lampard
[1658.68 - 1662.76] P:1836.63 E:0.081271 |  back to Barry 35 yards from goal should left foot is straight at the goal
[1662.76 - 1667.96] P:1953.20 E:0.079905 |  people at least we're doing a bird to phone really chasing up a case it spun
[1667.96 - 1672.52] P:1791.73 E:0.097832 |  back to Mazzone. Well I think you know it's early in the game I know but you've
[1672.52 - 1675.12] P:1835.18 E:0.103709 |  got probably as the game goes on you probably got a look at Gerald going in
[1675.12 - 1678.32] P:1828.37 E:0.090545 |  the middle Svane Stegas running the game there's no doubt about that we need
[1678.32 - 1682.16] P:1841.77 E:0.086151 |  somebody look at the two cent halves again and you've got to look at say
[1682.16 - 1685.84] P:1775.56 E:0.095398 |  somebody getting closer and break enough Svane Stegas Lampard and Barry for all
[1685.84 - 1689.12] P:1826.46 E:0.085190 |  the hold in its aims they don't play forward ever if you look they don't play
[1689.12 - 1694.52] P:1811.72 E:0.075906 |  any forward boards it's very slow they're always going back here is Barry and Barry
[1694.52 - 1700.64] P:1839.11 E:0.075157 |  drifts it towards the foes an awful ball from Gareth Barry Kaderer flicks it
[1700.64 - 1706.16] P:1712.78 E:0.072279 |  towards Urzel and it's beyond him and it's behind for a goal kick England nil
[1706.20 - 1714.88] P:1823.63 E:0.066496 |  Germany won in Blumfontein this is five live in the BBC Lampard for England into
[1714.88 - 1719.96] P:1771.39 E:0.076752 |  Barry inside the center circle and Barry slips the pass to the left hand side
[1719.96 - 1726.20] P:1826.02 E:0.074780 |  to Ashley Cole Cole back to Barry England still sluggish in buildup not enough
[1726.20 - 1732.44] P:1861.67 E:0.075540 |  movement Upson to Terry on to Rooney Rooney has come deep Rooney slips away
[1732.48 - 1736.72] P:1831.70 E:0.080834 |  from Friedrich passes to the right to Johnson only to foes in the penalty
[1736.72 - 1740.84] P:1761.60 E:0.082112 |  and I joined by Milner of all people Johnson trying to take on Podolski in
[1740.84 - 1744.92] P:1812.09 E:0.073634 |  the far side of the field Podolski tackles and beats him and then hits it up
[1744.92 - 1749.12] P:1758.53 E:0.085912 |  field straight to John Terry Terry who finds Lampard lazy pass from Lampard
[1749.12 - 1755.48] P:1835.71 E:0.066910 |  not good enough here's fine Stegas over the half way line tackled by Lampard at
[1755.48 - 1760.16] P:1832.44 E:0.063172 |  least you've got to say I don't know Germany's got attacks right they're not
[1760.20 - 1763.20] P:1888.21 E:0.093762 |  pushing on this was playing a lot of space playing stay on to the other
[1763.20 - 1766.96] P:1953.43 E:0.091675 |  middle of the park are basically bossing the game close as all the threat the
[1766.96 - 1769.36] P:1757.86 E:0.097082 |  two center of stone I hope the crowd who's going to pick him up who's going
[1769.36 - 1773.80] P:1847.99 E:0.070828 |  to cover to me you've got a tactic spot on at the moment well the reason for my
[1773.80 - 1779.72] P:1916.81 E:0.070437 |  pre-match optimism was basically I felt that either Lampard or Rooney or
[1779.72 - 1785.56] P:1944.72 E:0.068118 |  hopefully both would start to shine when they haven't yet and we play 27 minutes
[1785.60 - 1792.00] P:1927.44 E:0.070450 |  to the first half Germany lead 1-0 James all in yellow clears it right
[1792.00 - 1796.04] P:1831.64 E:0.077951 |  footed high towards to foe unequal task because where does that go to them but
[1796.04 - 1801.28] P:1920.39 E:0.075976 |  the ball breaks to Barry on to Rooney Rooney almost lost it Barry to Lampard
[1801.28 - 1804.76] P:1869.18 E:0.083349 |  it's so congested there only Gerard providing with down the left side and
[1804.76 - 1808.84] P:1875.92 E:0.085221 |  it comes to Gerard who points to Ashley Cole says get forward and then Gerard
[1808.84 - 1813.04] P:1874.41 E:0.084864 |  moves inside now he plays it towards Milner whose first touch wasn't great
[1813.08 - 1817.12] P:1914.08 E:0.089927 |  but Milner still has the ball he ran into the Euro-Guan referee shouldn't have
[1817.12 - 1821.76] P:1970.67 E:0.086479 |  been anyone near that and England lose possession now to the goal scorer closer
[1821.76 - 1827.52] P:1895.78 E:0.072066 |  closer run today to play to throw into England I think he's quite fortunate
[1827.52 - 1830.68] P:1741.42 E:0.101643 |  teams are so doesn't really want to run with the ball a lot today because he's
[1830.68 - 1838.00] P:1830.13 E:0.063958 |  got so much space when he picks it up Cole back to Upson and now to Terry and
[1838.36 - 1844.72] P:1777.29 E:0.077190 |  Terry on to the far side to Johnson 28 minutes play England ill Germany one on
[1844.72 - 1850.60] P:1764.81 E:0.069269 |  five line Upson again we've still been played at a very slow tempo the match
[1850.60 - 1858.24] P:1929.58 E:0.063015 |  awful pass forward from option 60 yards straight behind goal kick shocking we
[1858.24 - 1862.44] P:1808.96 E:0.094523 |  don't we need snow if you're watching this if you're watching this game in it
[1862.44 - 1865.84] P:1814.67 E:0.088414 |  Spain Stegor especially Spain Stegor more and could he up he's running the get

[2170.30 - 2177.14] P:1962.07 E:0.086127 |  we saw then good goal from Germany you could say that but so easily done by very
[2177.14 - 2183.66] P:1955.18 E:0.076097 |  very poor basic defending well the German fans are ecstatic as well they
[2183.66 - 2191.34] P:1868.67 E:0.073377 |  should be but let me give you a reverse situation let me think back to 1970 Leon

[2217.42 - 2221.22] P:1721.24 E:0.081947 |  keeps possession on the miller on the far side of the field England have lamp
[2221.22 - 2225.58] P:1952.27 E:0.091636 |  pardoned really waiting for the cross and Gerardy bleeding was lamp first touch
[2225.78 - 2230.42] P:1932.37 E:0.084055 |  I think the flag got to the goalkeeper and cleared by Germany I've got to say

[2234.02 - 2237.62] P:1838.36 E:0.094375 |  seen there get him in the box don't let him play deep he's not that tight with
[2237.62 - 2243.14] P:1910.25 E:0.075116 |  play up let him get forward and get in the box and he will get chances well he
[2243.14 - 2247.62] P:1768.02 E:0.090099 |  he did well there lamp pardon the goalkeeper nor did very well too it was
[2247.66 - 2249.62] P:1888.47 E:0.062652 |  a save by the goalkeeper

[2257.82 - 2263.94] P:2025.99 E:0.067955 |  actually doesn't merit his place on the pitch not good enough here's Muller
[2263.94 - 2268.58] P:1942.76 E:0.093493 |  Muller under closer close into the penalty area Johnson's across there and
[2268.58 - 2272.62] P:1898.04 E:0.091907 |  Johnson clears I think off closer no the referee from Uruguay's give it a corner
[2272.62 - 2277.10] P:1952.12 E:0.090521 |  say what the movement I'd say the problem muller comes inside and close as movement
[2277.10 - 2280.18] P:2018.22 E:0.086982 |  and with the dogs getting there so England's back for just kind of cope

[2301.98 - 2306.62] P:1925.18 E:0.091454 |  plays it in deep and it went a long way closest there in the six yard box and

[2321.02 - 2328.10] P:1964.62 E:0.073136 |  it's breathtakingly poor defensively from England in fact they've got to hang

[2578.02 - 2584.70] P:1909.02 E:0.074023 |  close as God of Gomez he's warming up Gomez is the only proper option closer

[2587.90 - 2592.06] P:1846.37 E:0.076621 |  option is headed England back into the game and we've got five minutes to go to

[2616.42 - 2620.50] P:1696.29 E:0.071915 |  now down the left side crossing right footed that's a good ball to the captain
[2620.50 - 2625.26] P:1920.18 E:0.081383 |  Lam Lam controls it but not well enough Gerrard's in there and it came off Lam

[2628.90 - 2631.66] P:1863.57 E:0.102644 |  as well getting under pressure a bit they haven't got a lot of experience in this
[2631.66 - 2637.50] P:1952.48 E:0.077256 |  team other a lot of young players well was that really a throw into Germany yes
[2637.50 - 2644.50] P:1892.47 E:0.067404 |  it was taken by Muller back to Kadirah who's a lookalike he from Milan
[2644.50 - 2649.90] P:1862.06 E:0.078899 |  Barras once a Liverpool and then Germany I lose the way the balls back with David

[2655.22 - 2663.34] P:1956.80 E:0.071510 |  yeah yeah but it should be 2-2 here's James still to hit the ball up here
[2663.34 - 2666.58] P:1925.91 E:0.089284 |  the sign of frustration being in goalkeeper he's not sure what proper
[2666.62 - 2670.94] P:1998.00 E:0.074766 |  options he's got it's over that we're getting big James finally clatters it
[2670.94 - 2675.30] P:1850.25 E:0.083350 |  towards the left side towards Gerrard who heads it infield Kadirah doesn't get
[2675.30 - 2678.78] P:1778.58 E:0.090514 |  there lampard heads it on to Rooney Rooney juggles with the ball and then he
[2678.78 - 2684.54] P:1866.37 E:0.075615 |  loses it the Schwanksteiger Schwanksteiger onto closer back now to Muller
[2684.54 - 2687.94] P:1866.82 E:0.087622 |  in a central position Muller Muller ahead of the center circle that's a good
[2687.94 - 2691.10] P:1886.58 E:0.090031 |  ball to the right to Osil Osil now cutting in towards the England penalty
[2691.14 - 2696.30] P:1920.95 E:0.076288 |  on his left foot then beats up and beats the full back call couldn't beat the
[2696.30 - 2700.06] P:1881.37 E:0.081049 |  challenge of Barry and it squirts behind for a goal kick it does that very well
[2700.06 - 2703.46] P:1959.51 E:0.098534 |  doesn't he looks if he's going to say puts Ashley Cole on the ground just over
[2703.46 - 2707.84] P:1810.72 E:0.081225 |  runs it Garith Barry doubling up three minutes to half time folks if you can
[2707.84 - 2712.66] P:1968.79 E:0.078393 |  breath a strain I wasn't nervous before the game but I'm just really now the way
[2712.66 - 2717.22] P:1914.59 E:0.076049 |  this the way this thing is playing out three goals on the first half to the
[2717.26 - 2724.46] P:1933.46 E:0.065266 |  Germany one to England James again slow to take the goal kick now he hits it
[2724.46 - 2727.66] P:1859.20 E:0.093064 |  once more towards Gerrard he's got the beating of Lam in the air ball runs
[2727.66 - 2732.22] P:1886.36 E:0.077505 |  through to Defoe Defoe holds off Murdozaka into Gerrard back now to Barry
[2732.22 - 2738.54] P:1931.59 E:0.069858 |  Gerrard again Gerrard looking for movement upfield but there isn't any so he
[2738.54 - 2744.62] P:1878.29 E:0.068640 |  plays it back to Oppson Gerrard wants more Oppson again onto his left foot and
[2744.62 - 2748.58] P:1865.52 E:0.082577 |  now it's a better ball to Rooney Rooney back to Gerrard and Gerrard hits it
[2748.58 - 2752.94] P:1921.18 E:0.082684 |  directly to the far side great ball to Milner Milner's touch was awful and
[2752.94 - 2758.62] P:1928.43 E:0.068176 |  it's with Podolski who finds the full back bokeh enters fine striker who plays
[2758.62 - 2762.46] P:1866.48 E:0.078792 |  into his goalkeeper who might not have fancied that and he clears it reluctantly
[2762.46 - 2766.74] P:1907.51 E:0.080222 |  towards the far side towards the left Johnson heads it off Podolski and it's
[2766.74 - 2771.42] P:1931.90 E:0.076255 |  out of play for an England throw it 90 seconds before out of time at the end of
[2771.42 - 2780.22] P:1941.15 E:0.067816 |  the first half lampart who denied a clear goal it it wasn't even close here's
[2780.22 - 2784.78] P:1921.89 E:0.078534 |  Rooney back to Barry good ball forward actually cold on the left side why did
[2784.78 - 2788.78] P:1912.32 E:0.084157 |  he get under control first time manages a second time crosses from the left deep
[2788.78 - 2794.30] P:1814.35 E:0.085178 |  poor cleared by Murdozaka out of play for throwing let's say Jeremy off I think
[2794.30 - 2797.66] P:1915.18 E:0.097965 |  Jeremy went off to him with some more in England at the minute England's since I
[2797.66 - 2800.70] P:1818.13 E:0.113317 |  went to no down and really took the game with Jeremy got the goal back shoot I
[2800.70 - 2803.26] P:1724.30 E:0.097032 |  don't know that one but we know a lamp probably haven't given it but it's a
[2803.26 - 2806.54] P:1939.93 E:0.085347 |  England have actually upped the tempo which they should have done from the
[2806.54 - 2810.62] P:1913.08 E:0.081657 |  beginning inside the final men to the first half throw a ghost of Rooney
[2810.62 - 2815.34] P:1774.16 E:0.074630 |  who's beaten by Kedira but the ball breaks up field and here's Terry to find
[2815.34 - 2819.06] P:1763.21 E:0.089534 |  Johnson inside the center circle and Johnson hitting it in the direction of
[2819.06 - 2822.62] P:1865.95 E:0.081655 |  Rooney good play by Lam no one he intercepts it but he plays it carefully
[2822.62 - 2826.58] P:1846.31 E:0.080644 |  to Murdozaka and then Murdozaka is another touch which wasn't so good he
[2826.62 - 2831.62] P:1808.63 E:0.081236 |  finding Lam eventually Lam's clearance upfield intercepted by Upson who just
[2831.62 - 2836.46] P:1761.22 E:0.089843 |  belts it on the half volley behind for a goal kick I'm not gonna tell you any rush
[2836.46 - 2839.50] P:1949.06 E:0.098154 |  to take this just come up half time we just don't see how many minutes are
[2839.50 - 2844.94] P:1865.78 E:0.076542 |  gonna add on he's got the board out now probably be one and maybe two can't
[2844.94 - 2852.42] P:1868.87 E:0.072785 |  think of too many stoppages I better the minute you're listening to five live
[2852.46 - 2859.46] P:1908.44 E:0.072976 |  as you should be except no imitations England one Germany to here comes the
[2859.46 - 2865.18] P:1911.37 E:0.085848 |  fourth official he won't hold it up until 45 bang on England have the ball
[2865.18 - 2870.46] P:1822.36 E:0.080454 |  Rooney's got on the halfway line a minute about a time to be played John Terry
[2870.46 - 2874.98] P:1924.91 E:0.081566 |  Terry onto Milner left by Milner deliberately Johnson chases after can he
[2874.98 - 2879.14] P:1881.25 E:0.075577 |  keep it a play I didn't think he did and I was waiting for the lines when the
[2879.18 - 2885.62] P:1737.01 E:0.072448 |  flag and he flag belatedly it's out for a throwing one is one minute he's just
[2885.62 - 2892.02] P:1837.99 E:0.075777 |  announced but Germany again no rush remind me what to do to that you're a
[2892.02 - 2897.10] P:1845.07 E:0.073895 |  grand linesman should I spot him at an airport later in the tournament I'll be
[2897.10 - 2903.26] P:1942.36 E:0.073618 |  looking for you son ball is with England with cold 20 seconds of the out at
[2903.26 - 2907.74] P:1869.31 E:0.082333 |  time remaining now it's with Upson Jara's getting much more involved he's
[2907.78 - 2912.94] P:1917.16 E:0.072620 |  drifting in saying give the ball to me and I'll direct a first Upson again to
[2912.94 - 2916.70] P:1894.15 E:0.086312 |  Ashley Cole and cold back to Upson it looks as if England are playing out
[2916.70 - 2920.54] P:1938.98 E:0.089917 |  time now at a half time as well it could have been worse folks a lot worse
[2920.54 - 2925.46] P:1997.70 E:0.087057 |  Terry hits it up field towards Rooney who's still not in the game at all and
[2925.46 - 2929.58] P:1990.25 E:0.089750 |  looking showing his frustration he's screaming at the linesman he thinks he
[2929.58 - 2933.22] P:1941.78 E:0.088127 |  should have had a free kick but the truth is weighing you've got to look at
[2933.26 - 2939.22] P:1933.97 E:0.080841 |  your own form it isn't good enough and it is half time Chris got to say Germany
[2939.22 - 2942.38] P:1887.17 E:0.109039 |  for 35 minutes this game should have put the game beyond it should have been
[2942.38 - 2946.90] P:1902.47 E:0.100609 |  three maybe four lamp adds up a half chance and he scored a proper goal but
[2946.90 - 2950.54] P:1913.11 E:0.093057 |  obviously the lanesman was too far up the field to see it cross the lane and
[2950.54 - 2954.34] P:1891.44 E:0.099596 |  England's came in at the last 10 minutes of the half so a little bit the thing
[2954.34 - 2956.94] P:1764.14 E:0.101430 |  keep this tempo up I can see them getting back into the game
[2958.22 - 2961.58] P:1832.40 E:0.100416 |  absolutely says give it England hope with that headed goal half time here in
[2961.58 - 2967.70] P:1971.94 E:0.089419 |  Blumfontein England 1 Germany 2 well without question mark but the ultimate
[2967.70 - 2973.54] P:2001.39 E:0.091184 |  payback really for 1966 in this first half I just wonder how you get to be a
[2973.54 - 2979.18] P:2072.09 E:0.081582 |  linesman at a World Cup officiating in a game of this magnitude and to make a
[2979.18 - 2985.30] P:2001.15 E:0.088391 |  mistake like that complete travesty was outrageous it was two or three feet over
[2985.30 - 2990.46] P:2060.71 E:0.084657 |  the line but we move on and no changes made I don't think by either side the
[2990.46 - 2994.38] P:1980.17 E:0.087758 |  England line at remember it looks like this James who made a couple of
[2994.38 - 2997.86] P:1985.47 E:0.085671 |  important saves actually in that first half Johnson Upson Terry and Cole
[2997.86 - 3002.74] P:1963.98 E:0.086695 |  Milner lampard Barry Gerard Rooney and a foe the Germans with Neuer in gold
[3002.74 - 3004.86] P:2024.40 E:0.084317 |  look too clever when he was put under pressure
[3004.86 - 3009.22] P:1978.73 E:0.087241 |  Larm Friedrich Mertesaker and Boateng Kedirish Weinsteiger Muller Ersel
[3009.22 - 3014.54] P:1972.73 E:0.081679 |  Podolski closer Podolski closer who really haven't had the best of times
[3014.54 - 3019.58] P:1935.24 E:0.083244 |  domestically but 40 goals now for Podolski at international level 50 for
[3019.62 - 3025.30] P:1932.64 E:0.086985 |  closer he's now scored 12 by the way at World Cups and only Muller with 14 ahead
[3025.30 - 3030.26] P:1902.06 E:0.085096 |  of him now having of course appeared in this is third World Cup so where we go
[3030.26 - 3034.34] P:1950.95 E:0.088552 |  in the second half in the second half England play from left to right all in
[3034.34 - 3038.70] P:2022.92 E:0.082936 |  red need to put Germany on the back foot straight away England will need to get
[3038.70 - 3043.86] P:1961.20 E:0.071364 |  Gerard I think more centrally involved as the second half progresses and they
[3043.86 - 3046.82] P:2164.85 E:0.099525 |  need to channel all the aggression and all the hurt they'll be feeling as well
[3047.42 - 3050.18] P:2058.05 E:0.101565 |  certainly will they'll be firing their bellies because they will know that that
[3050.18 - 3054.74] P:1951.87 E:0.076364 |  ball was well over from Frank Lampard and if you're just joining our commentary
[3054.74 - 3061.02] P:1955.21 E:0.071908 |  on five live England really fortunate not to concede early on when James saved
[3061.02 - 3066.74] P:1980.64 E:0.076493 |  from Ersel then the goal route one for Germany goalkeeper took a kick Terry
[3066.74 - 3070.86] P:2029.29 E:0.083537 |  let it bounce Upson Dilly Dallied and then was out muscled by closer James
[3070.86 - 3075.90] P:1874.51 E:0.072110 |  stayed rooted to the spot closest scored one no Germany and then it was Muller
[3075.94 - 3079.66] P:1965.83 E:0.073885 |  who set up Podolski for the second England getting one back through Upson
[3079.66 - 3083.82] P:1958.59 E:0.077880 |  should have been 2-2 at halftime Lampard's goal not given Lampard on the
[3083.82 - 3089.02] P:1955.96 E:0.070714 |  ball now Lampard feeding Ashley Cole over on the far side the left losing the
[3089.02 - 3092.74] P:1960.00 E:0.076805 |  sunshine now and the players will be happier that it's a cooler temperature
[3092.74 - 3097.34] P:1933.57 E:0.068795 |  Gareth Barry running backwards just stepped the ball back to Upson once
[3097.34 - 3101.54] P:1965.40 E:0.083967 |  more Upson who scored against Germany again header on from Rooney looking for
[3101.54 - 3104.94] P:1976.01 E:0.078524 |  Ashley Cole and there's Neuer remember Upson scored his other international
[3104.98 - 3108.62] P:1984.67 E:0.077351 |  goal for England in Berlin in a friendly victory for England 2-1 it's
[3108.62 - 3114.02] P:1879.10 E:0.088774 |  Chris Waddle actually put the right side of the tuck on the right wing now
[3114.02 - 3117.70] P:1911.94 E:0.093305 |  Muller's gone alongside close he's playing in Ersel's role just off the
[3117.70 - 3121.34] P:1884.35 E:0.076418 |  striker why do you think they've done that well it's like I thought give the
[3121.34 - 3124.14] P:1876.18 E:0.099918 |  ball away Muller was having a good game his movement was excellent and he is a
[3124.14 - 3127.78] P:1876.35 E:0.072720 |  center forward normally for Bayern Munich Friedrich falls to main to
[3127.78 - 3132.34] P:1898.05 E:0.077086 |  Foe and the thing is but is and he's gonna get a yellow card here Friedrich
[3132.74 - 3137.22] P:2047.50 E:0.078181 |  he's not gonna miss the next game if Germany get through but the thing is here
[3137.22 - 3141.62] P:1967.36 E:0.081439 |  when England have managed to turn on the gas here and put the German defenders
[3141.62 - 3144.26] P:1987.96 E:0.087428 |  under a bit of pressure towards the end of the first half they look
[3144.26 - 3148.42] P:2053.76 E:0.077653 |  vulnerable this game is not over yet for England they're trailing by two goals to
[3148.42 - 3153.58] P:1837.30 E:0.073383 |  one here in Blomfontein and Lampard edge of the center circle just inside the
[3153.58 - 3157.70] P:1936.60 E:0.080268 |  German half now preparing to take this free kick lifting it in towards Upson
[3157.70 - 3160.90] P:2049.16 E:0.091120 |  easy header away though by Germany Rooney gonna try and head it back in again
[3161.06 - 3164.42] P:1984.30 E:0.074086 |  shot driven in well wide in the end by James Mulder and that's a goal kick to
[3164.42 - 3167.62] P:1947.34 E:0.084820 |  Germany it's just interesting as well since they came up the second half the
[3167.62 - 3171.34] P:1889.33 E:0.090138 |  walk there warming up Jansen as a midfield player and Cruz who's a midfield
[3171.34 - 3174.34] P:1956.19 E:0.093056 |  person I just wonder if Sainz Stegas feeling his arm string slightly they've
[3174.34 - 3177.70] P:1914.35 E:0.088552 |  got them warming up very early well that would be great news for England if
[3177.70 - 3181.98] P:2023.12 E:0.088625 |  Schweinsteiger because he was very very influential in the early part of this
[3181.98 - 3186.22] P:1976.93 E:0.085681 |  game to settle Germany down clearance then by Neuer the German goalkeeper Terry
[3186.22 - 3190.26] P:2035.64 E:0.082170 |  almost lost that one but he managed to recover and now it's Gerard stabbing it
[3190.30 - 3193.38] P:1905.78 E:0.075420 |  straight back to the German defenders and it's going to be a throw in to
[3193.38 - 3196.70] P:1995.86 E:0.082596 |  Germany and of course immediately now they're slowing things down here and
[3196.70 - 3202.42] P:1846.72 E:0.071779 |  taking their time you're listening to five live Germany to England one is the
[3202.42 - 3207.58] P:1941.81 E:0.082945 |  score here it should be two to England having a perfectly good goal not given
[3207.58 - 3212.14] P:1821.20 E:0.078840 |  the linesman not flagging the ball was so far over the line it wasn't true and
[3212.14 - 3216.66] P:1995.94 E:0.086871 |  now the Germans through Larm miss the ball and Gerard takes up possession down
[3216.66 - 3219.90] P:2018.15 E:0.085960 |  the England left here comes Gerard cutting in from the far touch line and a
[3219.94 - 3223.94] P:2040.95 E:0.087748 |  weak shot in the end from Gerard shovel well-wired with Rooney to Foe and
[3223.94 - 3228.22] P:1997.17 E:0.081737 |  Milder all looking for service and Lampard's drifted in there as well Gerard
[3228.22 - 3232.14] P:1970.79 E:0.077271 |  Lacer come and said on that right foot trying to get the shot off pulls it out
[3232.14 - 3236.50] P:1906.29 E:0.086548 |  of the way but it's up England yeah they are thinking it's a goal for it mate with
[3236.50 - 3240.46] P:1890.00 E:0.091555 |  the tempo high and really put this team under pressure they will get equaliser
[3240.46 - 3245.90] P:1914.56 E:0.064592 |  and at some point in the second half and then chasing the game may need Joe
[3245.90 - 3249.86] P:1910.75 E:0.080266 |  Cole to perhaps come on if they're going to get Gerard more centrally involved
[3249.86 - 3253.46] P:1942.16 E:0.080278 |  as Neuer clears now but England at the same time have to be very careful
[3253.46 - 3256.86] P:1992.31 E:0.086318 |  defensively another German goal and that surely would be too much for England to
[3256.86 - 3261.10] P:1937.39 E:0.076244 |  pull back it's two one to Germany and we're in the early stages of the second
[3261.10 - 3264.10] P:1910.85 E:0.079522 |  half Germany now with the enormous figure of

[3267.70 - 3271.98] P:1929.08 E:0.071777 |  down captain against captain there Gerard against Larm and it's quite a slow
[3272.02 - 3275.58] P:1769.72 E:0.077946 |  tempo to the start of the second half that's no good England they've got up the
[3275.58 - 3280.50] P:1980.20 E:0.078066 |  tempo that's what Germany played well when it was slow like it is now that's
[3280.50 - 3284.10] P:1831.53 E:0.092403 |  what they were good at but when England up the tempo and no turn no down Germany
[3284.10 - 3287.78] P:1928.73 E:0.083538 |  couldn't cope with it. Murdersack in the end held it for as long as he could and
[3287.78 - 3291.94] P:1924.52 E:0.079276 |  then gave it back to Neuer and Neuer clears Neuer's ball into the England
[3291.94 - 3295.66] P:2053.56 E:0.079625 |  defense Upson has to be careful judges the header right and Ashley Cole now
[3295.66 - 3299.34] P:2027.99 E:0.081303 |  almost thought about a dangerous ball back in said it's gone back to David
[3299.38 - 3302.46] P:2095.62 E:0.078209 |  James now who clears to the half wayline they're looking now for some
[3302.46 - 3306.38] P:2016.50 E:0.075246 |  aggression from Rooney but it's well one in the air by Friedrich second half

[3313.38 - 3318.26] P:1997.27 E:0.083292 |  far side Larm will keep it in Larm now going past Rooney and then clearing with
[3318.26 - 3323.02] P:1986.86 E:0.074502 |  his left foot his preferred foot in steps Matthew Upson and now Barry with a ball
[3323.02 - 3326.78] P:2066.30 E:0.086685 |  hosted forward not accurately enough though and Germany didn't really need to
[3326.82 - 3330.74] P:1942.36 E:0.081861 |  do that they conceded a thrown over on the far side and the England fans lifted
[3330.74 - 3334.54] P:2013.15 E:0.093720 |  up for their team Germany leading by two goals to one in the early stages here
[3334.54 - 3339.50] P:1950.43 E:0.067608 |  at the second half Germany to know up after 32 minutes by the way now it's
[3339.50 - 3342.74] P:1985.35 E:0.078719 |  Johnson of England always hit that straight at Padovsky and England have a
[3342.74 - 3347.58] P:1915.32 E:0.078875 |  thrown down below on the right hand side Fabio Capello we see for the first time
[3347.58 - 3352.22] P:1868.46 E:0.077224 |  just motioning to Wayne Rooney already five minutes gone in the second half
[3352.22 - 3356.66] P:1934.69 E:0.079683 |  Barry now turning away from Kedira Barry's ball to the far side trying to find

[3369.98 - 3372.38] P:1921.50 E:0.088746 |  to have to battle back against the Germans in the World Cup and it's now
[3372.38 - 3376.14] P:1963.40 E:0.086415 |  Stephen Gerard flattened on the half wayline referees played an advantage it
[3376.14 - 3379.58] P:1941.78 E:0.090064 |  was a foul by Schweinsteiger Terry into Rooney Rooney though doesn't control it
[3379.58 - 3383.82] P:1987.81 E:0.071731 |  he's won a free kick against Friedrich and it's a free kick to England about
[3383.86 - 3389.66] P:1962.40 E:0.079204 |  15 yards inside the German half chance here to test the goalkeeper Neuer once
[3389.66 - 3394.98] P:1976.30 E:0.079260 |  more Lampard stands over the ball Lampard should have scored his first goal
[3394.98 - 3399.14] P:1943.99 E:0.087032 |  at a World Cup tournament here it was not given it was clearly over the line
[3399.14 - 3404.26] P:1920.73 E:0.077290 |  it would have made it 2-2 so here comes Frank Lampard now would he go for power
[3404.26 - 3408.10] P:1987.86 E:0.085300 |  here and try and get the goalkeeper to make a save and then they'll come rushing
[3408.22 - 3415.46] P:1926.85 E:0.066252 |  in for the bits and pieces Lampard's poised Neuer moves around on his line and
[3415.46 - 3420.58] P:1909.01 E:0.085213 |  here comes Frank Lampard with a goal hit the bar Lampard strikes the bar it takes
[3420.58 - 3424.54] P:1915.27 E:0.084005 |  an awful long time to come back in Upson couldn't get it and it's boating
[3424.54 - 3429.50] P:1961.09 E:0.082104 |  and clears to the far side what has Lampard got to do to score here he's
[3429.50 - 3432.58] P:2011.33 E:0.097885 |  already had one goal which should have been given he's hit the bar with a
[3432.58 - 3437.14] P:2015.39 E:0.088815 |  thunderous free kick and England come forward once more now Terry on to Johnson
[3437.50 - 3441.62] P:2034.61 E:0.092057 |  two on to Germany but the game is there for England if they can just keep it
[3441.62 - 3446.50] P:1984.36 E:0.091041 |  going here Milner with a poor ball in though way above the foe and Rooney
[3446.50 - 3450.54] P:1886.69 E:0.072792 |  they need better delivery than that it's a goal kick what a terrific start by
[3450.54 - 3455.54] P:1904.11 E:0.087269 |  Frank Lampard wasn't it what 30 yards terrific hit and goalkeeper now we're
[3455.54 - 3460.58] P:1909.23 E:0.077702 |  near it third team lucky hopefully for Frank but England's got a good tempo
[3460.58 - 3464.78] P:1946.23 E:0.098684 |  here Germany are struggling to look tired and the Ryung say they're inexperienced
[3464.82 - 3468.14] P:1992.85 E:0.087975 |  they're feeling the pressure well England were all over the place in the first half
[3468.14 - 3472.58] P:1873.65 E:0.080942 |  an hour they could have been out of the game totally but now they coming back
[3472.58 - 3477.22] P:1986.80 E:0.084613 |  strongly here but they must score the next goal Germany now looking to Muller
[3477.22 - 3481.58] P:1987.69 E:0.081201 |  over on the far side on to close who's given offside and that's a free kick to
[3481.58 - 3484.34] P:1907.57 E:0.093028 |  England but there's the danger for England there's always a threat when you've got
[3484.34 - 3488.22] P:1990.52 E:0.082040 |  more close to Padozko on the left the Nersle just playing off there but this
[3488.22 - 3491.42] P:1882.62 E:0.091991 |  back four is getting tested now and the two boys in midfielder not dominating
[3491.46 - 3496.30] P:1949.57 E:0.072179 |  any more two German boys free kick to England which goalkeeper James will take
[3496.30 - 3500.02] P:1849.05 E:0.083802 |  seven nearly eight minutes gone in the second half Germans leading here by two
[3500.02 - 3504.18] P:1888.73 E:0.074983 |  goals to one they were good value in the opening half an hour that England
[3504.18 - 3508.82] P:1929.31 E:0.078210 |  getting back into the game and then stung by that goal which wasn't given
[3508.82 - 3514.26] P:1927.78 E:0.068524 |  and I'm aware of the fact that you may be joining us all the time and it you know
[3514.26 - 3518.94] P:1837.60 E:0.085790 |  we can't go on too much about 1966 but of course everyone knows what happened
[3518.98 - 3522.42] P:1906.70 E:0.093158 |  there with the Jeff Hirst goal and here well this one there was absolutely no
[3522.42 - 3527.18] P:1970.80 E:0.085312 |  debate at all no no debate it was two three feet over the line from Frank
[3527.18 - 3532.10] P:2012.26 E:0.084637 |  Lampard it would have made it two two instead and now Neuer is really taking a
[3532.10 - 3536.54] P:1968.62 E:0.091749 |  lot of time the referee needs to really impose himself here this is deliberate
[3536.54 - 3541.42] P:1899.22 E:0.075002 |  time wasting as Germany's goalkeeper now clears into the England half there's no
[3541.42 - 3543.22] P:2036.75 E:0.078779 |  challenge coming in from any England player
[3543.22 - 3546.86] P:1984.10 E:0.081135 |  Ersel drops the ball back to Schweinsteiger on the half wayline and now
[3546.90 - 3551.46] P:2019.89 E:0.084296 |  boating into Ersel and Schweinsteiger looking to lay it forward to Pudolski
[3551.46 - 3555.46] P:2006.67 E:0.083517 |  but England you feel are starting to get it an initiative here if they can just
[3555.46 - 3560.82] P:1975.16 E:0.078059 |  carry it on Johnson back again to James that was uncertain play by the two of
[3560.82 - 3563.86] P:2048.86 E:0.085057 |  them James clears and the trouble for England is there's not much height up
[3563.86 - 3567.10] P:1932.59 E:0.095192 |  front when they get the ball forward neither Defoe nor Rooney can trouble
[3567.10 - 3571.62] P:1973.16 E:0.090080 |  Murdersacker oh and now that's lost the ball easily it's closer for Germany poor
[3571.62 - 3575.86] P:2060.43 E:0.088283 |  play from England closest ball in John Terry's in the way and it's a corner
[3575.86 - 3579.22] P:1876.82 E:0.094036 |  kick to Germany far side the right John Terry sloppy ball to Alpsen it didn't
[3579.22 - 3582.82] P:1904.57 E:0.109935 |  get near him and close I read it and he was away down at right hand side yes
[3582.82 - 3586.74] P:1917.00 E:0.091316 |  Terry's recovered to put it out for a corner to Germany which would be no
[3586.74 - 3592.14] P:2005.60 E:0.084773 |  rush again Ersel's drugged over there well another goal for Germany and it
[3592.14 - 3596.70] P:2022.20 E:0.088444 |  really will be very hard to see England getting back into this game two one they
[3596.70 - 3601.26] P:1999.87 E:0.085659 |  lead and it's a short corner drag back to Philippe Larm Larm back again to Ersel
[3601.26 - 3605.34] P:2000.45 E:0.081060 |  wide on the right back again to Larm they're teasing England now the cross
[3605.38 - 3608.90] P:1932.80 E:0.089634 |  comes in and Wayne Rooney's there with a defensive header and this time it'll be
[3608.90 - 3613.02] P:2005.95 E:0.081521 |  a throw to Germany over on the far side but Germany now just having a few
[3613.02 - 3618.66] P:1860.34 E:0.074284 |  moments inside being them half throw in which again they're taking a long time
[3618.66 - 3624.18] P:1890.39 E:0.068385 |  over ball thrown down to Larm and now it's Ersel trying a couple of tricks down
[3624.18 - 3627.82] P:1959.94 E:0.081045 |  that right hand side and Larm takes over and it's a typical charge from him
[3627.82 - 3631.78] P:1976.85 E:0.081422 |  Gerard is there with a good smothering challenge and Germany winner throne
[3631.82 - 3636.10] P:1870.44 E:0.080443 |  which I suspect Larm was looking for anyway by the corner flag two on to
[3636.10 - 3642.06] P:1954.32 E:0.074695 |  Germany on five live and 35 more minutes to go in this game ball thrown back to
[3642.06 - 3646.54] P:1894.15 E:0.075642 |  Murdersharker Murdersharker finding Larm again down the German right they're
[3646.54 - 3650.82] P:1958.59 E:0.083949 |  just keeping possession here the Germans oh still on to Muller almost got that
[3650.82 - 3655.30] P:1968.06 E:0.082146 |  back to Ersel and now Kudera into the area good play good one twos there from
[3655.30 - 3660.02] P:1985.24 E:0.082418 |  Germany outcomes David James he wants to launch England and he finds Lampard and
[3660.06 - 3663.98] P:2015.72 E:0.089861 |  Lampard takes the ball now into the German half he's got Gerard on the outside
[3663.98 - 3667.94] P:1988.75 E:0.077851 |  the left hand side here comes Steven Gerard the England captain taking on
[3667.94 - 3671.66] P:2002.62 E:0.088043 |  Philip Larm plays the ball into central midfield to Barry Ashley Coles made a
[3671.66 - 3675.90] P:1998.16 E:0.087201 |  run Gerard again now for England Gerard from the angle wasted really hits it
[3675.90 - 3678.50] P:1848.12 E:0.089153 |  straight to the goalkeeper he's not going to score from there Steve and Gerard he has
[3678.50 - 3681.70] P:1880.41 E:0.096238 |  got talent in that right foot but there's no way he's going to be the goalkeeper
[3681.70 - 3684.74] P:2009.81 E:0.105748 |  from that angle he's got three red shirts again in the box where Mooney was in a
[3684.74 - 3689.30] P:1966.23 E:0.074726 |  terrific position selected the shot we're here from Graham Taylor in a moment for
[3689.34 - 3692.30] P:2058.71 E:0.086566 |  the first time in the second half as Johnson has to take care of Fadolski
[3692.30 - 3696.18] P:2068.48 E:0.095084 |  down there and Johnson keeps it in two one to Germany oh Johnson very careless
[3696.18 - 3702.06] P:2005.05 E:0.075148 |  as Chris Waddle thumps the table here in frustration and exasperation Johnson
[3702.06 - 3707.34] P:1955.32 E:0.077943 |  with very poor control there handing back once more the ball to Germany it's the
[3707.34 - 3711.42] P:1978.77 E:0.085204 |  tall figure of Boateng the left back Boateng's ball in towards Muller one has
[3711.42 - 3715.66] P:2036.76 E:0.085403 |  been a real handful for England today and now England take possession and Gerard
[3715.70 - 3719.70] P:2011.40 E:0.080495 |  from quite a long way out just about gets enough on the ball to send it back
[3719.70 - 3723.86] P:1826.47 E:0.075161 |  to David James and here's Graham Taylor yeah I'd like to hear higher tempo from
[3723.86 - 3729.14] P:1887.22 E:0.079537 |  England but one of the things that have noticeable is that Barry Gareth Barry is
[3729.14 - 3733.86] P:1879.95 E:0.087033 |  certainly hanging back looking round and lampard getting forward as you said
[3733.86 - 3737.06] P:1924.85 E:0.095804 |  towards the end of the second half but he's certainly doing more of that in the
[3737.06 - 3740.22] P:1929.22 E:0.075782 |  in in this particular half as well.
[3740.26 - 3745.50] P:2053.27 E:0.100050 |  The ball on to the foe, out comes the goalkeeper who just arrives in the nick of time to
[3745.50 - 3749.70] P:2003.17 E:0.084865 |  thwart Jermaine Defoe the only problem that personally I'm having here is that
[3749.70 - 3754.46] P:1965.91 E:0.090768 |  there is still anxiety every time Germany go forward the England centre backs
[3754.46 - 3758.54] P:1948.61 E:0.086331 |  not really on top form today it's Stephen Gerard from a long way out and again
[3758.54 - 3762.54] P:1908.96 E:0.079016 |  he's wasted it the intent was right there from the England captain but it's
[3762.54 - 3767.66] P:1898.75 E:0.076224 |  there's no power in the shot there's no direction and it's gone wide this game

[3772.02 - 3776.90] P:1866.09 E:0.078510 |  minutes gone in the second half Germany already quite transparently wasting
[3776.90 - 3780.86] P:1985.57 E:0.086961 |  time here and it's La Montage-Scheinsteiger who's missed his kick and
[3780.86 - 3785.14] P:1951.19 E:0.080017 |  Chris Waddle wondering how Fitz-Scheinsteiger might be England now
[3785.14 - 3789.02] P:2059.54 E:0.091980 |  it's enticing up to do oh actually goal dangerous ball Barry has to scramble it
[3789.02 - 3792.42] P:1970.05 E:0.082161 |  back quickly England mustn't be careless like that and now Barry with the
[3792.42 - 3796.66] P:2051.81 E:0.085660 |  ball towards Rooney who's easy and they need to keep the ball down as well when
[3796.66 - 3799.18] P:2042.81 E:0.093295 |  they get it for there's no point putting in the air towards Mertersacker
[3799.18 - 3804.74] P:1949.56 E:0.080620 |  will win those all day two under Germany on five live and nearly 15 minutes gone
[3804.74 - 3810.02] P:1929.16 E:0.067208 |  in the second half already moving towards the time that Capello may think
[3810.02 - 3813.58] P:2010.41 E:0.079984 |  about changes at the same time he's mindful of the fact that this could still
[3813.58 - 3817.18] P:1955.38 E:0.084802 |  go to penalties hasn't got to take off any of his penalty takers yet and that's
[3817.18 - 3822.02] P:1993.83 E:0.079434 |  a really dreadful ball by Epson again it's the third time he's done that really
[3822.02 - 3826.34] P:1937.75 E:0.080984 |  poor ball nothing ball forward straight back again to the German goalkeeper
[3826.34 - 3828.34] P:1921.08 E:0.031253 |  and doyer
[3828.34 - 3832.22] P:1898.31 E:0.100254 |  we look at substitution show I know Joe Coles be mentioned and I'm sure he's
[3832.22 - 3835.50] P:1903.93 E:0.093565 |  got a chance I just want to see somebody get the ball off the back for
[3835.50 - 3840.06] P:1921.84 E:0.081533 |  and pass it forward you can put Gerard in there we know that and we could put
[3840.06 - 3842.54] P:1983.61 E:0.107715 |  somewhere under Joe Coles on the left but we need someone who's going to get the
[3842.54 - 3845.82] P:2010.07 E:0.091528 |  ball in the middle of the park and start hitting a bit of quality forward to the
[3845.82 - 3850.42] P:2052.93 E:0.085406 |  two straighters and to the two wade men a game of complete frustration for England
[3850.42 - 3853.58] P:2039.18 E:0.080061 |  the disallow of it I say keep saying disallowed it wasn't given it should
[3853.62 - 3856.90] P:2041.14 E:0.082988 |  have been given but also the sense that England can put the Germans under pressure
[3856.90 - 3860.10] P:2082.48 E:0.086379 |  here but now they're having to defend themselves Padoski apart from scoring
[3860.10 - 3863.46] P:2004.36 E:0.083349 |  has been quite quiet here's the danger man now Muller nice change of pace
[3863.46 - 3867.70] P:2006.73 E:0.093426 |  English show him along they showed him too much of the goal there Muller and in
[3867.70 - 3872.42] P:1990.65 E:0.084705 |  the end he drags a shot wide but he's the player this young 20 year old England
[3872.42 - 3877.14] P:1991.02 E:0.084137 |  are having problems picking up he's very tall composed on the ball and England
[3877.14 - 3880.30] P:1933.93 E:0.095920 |  just haven't managed to track him at all well if you look at that John Terry he
[3880.42 - 3884.82] P:1940.05 E:0.094882 |  goes past John Terry he's not there go Barry it's actually Coles run right
[3884.82 - 3892.98] P:1943.84 E:0.059873 |  across the box China put him off so half an hour to go here in Blumfontein
[3892.98 - 3897.86] P:2013.23 E:0.083752 |  Germany leading by two goals to one England looking to try and climb up the
[3897.86 - 3900.98] P:2012.87 E:0.091146 |  gears here in the second half it's an hopeful ball from Ashley Cole but again
[3900.98 - 3904.58] P:2008.65 E:0.080615 |  it's in the air and Mercer sack it just stoopes and heads it down to his captain
[3904.58 - 3909.94] P:1965.88 E:0.077895 |  Lam Lam's ball in now to closer closer and Padoski for Germany up some pulling
[3909.98 - 3913.14] P:1940.72 E:0.081185 |  one back for England who'd now want to throw in over on the far side but the
[3913.14 - 3917.70] P:1905.64 E:0.081924 |  talking point and my word will it be a talking point if England go out will be
[3917.70 - 3922.62] P:1944.95 E:0.079950 |  the goal that should have been given Lampard's strike off the bar two or three
[3922.62 - 3925.74] P:2093.39 E:0.091976 |  feet over the line Rooney almost got Gerard through there it's Ashley Cole
[3925.74 - 3929.74] P:2063.97 E:0.087774 |  is venturing forward now for England Rooney for England almost got
[3929.74 - 3933.98] P:1923.40 E:0.083374 |  into Lampard it was over hit though but Rooney normally would make those sorts
[3933.98 - 3938.94] P:1972.27 E:0.072024 |  of passes and out comes the goalkeeper once more Neuer to throw downfield that
[3938.94 - 3941.82] P:1898.61 E:0.092608 |  was a terrific what's no I don't throw you just throw it straight out of play
[3941.82 - 3945.54] P:1861.36 E:0.091243 |  ridiculous that was a lamp on board which made Rooney play the past that's
[3945.54 - 3949.26] P:1876.70 E:0.091386 |  what you see will on board you've got to get them forward I agree with Alan Green
[3949.26 - 3952.42] P:2061.47 E:0.085411 |  this is not a great German side in terms of the history of the country but now
[3952.42 - 3956.38] P:2036.08 E:0.091956 |  it's Wayne Rooney for England in rain Rooney's ball towards Milder
[3956.38 - 3960.50] P:2001.56 E:0.090204 |  Melnus ball that was well held by Neuer this time excellent great was really
[3960.50 - 3963.82] P:2050.44 E:0.085156 |  good handling in the six yard area by the German goalkeeper that was a decent
[3963.82 - 3968.58] P:1901.14 E:0.084247 |  ball to mind the full gambles at the up post maybe it's a good save
[3968.62 - 3973.46] P:1978.74 E:0.075957 |  held it well Upton now doesn't get the ball away from closer but Barry steps in
[3973.46 - 3976.70] P:2059.92 E:0.097355 |  on the halfway line and Gareth Barry now motoring for England on to Rooney
[3976.70 - 3981.18] P:1996.11 E:0.098717 |  Rooney goes past one defender Rooney sets it up for Milner can Milner score
[3981.18 - 3986.30] P:1990.95 E:0.084875 |  hit it straight at boating good block there by the left back but that's so
[3986.30 - 3989.90] P:2076.14 E:0.093269 |  much better for England who are starting to open up this German defense
[3989.90 - 3993.62] P:1948.71 E:0.098600 |  well it's starting to get stretched out the two boys in midfield are feeling the
[3993.62 - 3996.78] P:1973.09 E:0.103328 |  pace for Germany that's allowing England now to pick up all the second balls
[3996.82 - 4001.34] P:2036.67 E:0.083115 |  Milner for England down the right hand side this time with his left foot looking
[4001.34 - 4005.18] P:1968.72 E:0.090186 |  to play in Rooney again only finds the head of Murdersack a Germany clear closer
[4005.18 - 4009.42] P:1966.34 E:0.082428 |  reaches for it but Terry managed to get a boot in and the Germans failed to clear
[4009.42 - 4013.02] P:2054.64 E:0.094958 |  and it's Ashley Cole for England remember Germany leading by two goals to one
[4013.02 - 4017.82] P:1958.57 E:0.081416 |  Cole can't get past Philippe Lam though and Lam doing very well from that far
[4017.82 - 4021.38] P:2001.59 E:0.083696 |  side gives it back to Murdersack who smoothly finds Schweinsteiger and that's
[4021.38 - 4025.10] P:1968.80 E:0.084877 |  really good play now by Germany out of defense Terry winning the ball back and
[4025.14 - 4029.78] P:1944.07 E:0.086102 |  Barry referee the Muller's thrown himself down and it's Frank Lampard now
[4029.78 - 4033.14] P:1943.71 E:0.098194 |  lovely ball by Lampard Rooney's got away from the defender looking for the bow
[4033.14 - 4036.94] P:2030.05 E:0.100789 |  he goes to bow Gerard was almost in there Friedrich just managed to get a
[4036.94 - 4041.86] P:2007.37 E:0.091544 |  foot on the ball the defender and England almost through there Germany are
[4041.86 - 4045.18] P:1961.24 E:0.110854 |  feeling the place England's up the tempo slightly in the two boys in midfield
[4045.18 - 4049.38] P:1888.46 E:0.093896 |  as they could either and stay in space they've gone on the ball but they're not
[4049.38 - 4053.22] P:2069.24 E:0.087295 |  competing anymore Jochen Lo maybe the manager who has to make changes here but
[4053.26 - 4057.18] P:2023.00 E:0.088998 |  of course England every time Germany go forward have to make sure the doors
[4057.18 - 4060.98] P:2081.85 E:0.090286 |  closed as Podolski plays a very good ball into Wurzel Podolski goes for the
[4060.98 - 4064.90] P:2028.04 E:0.082179 |  return sends it square to Kedira Kedira now looking for help from Schweinsteiger
[4064.90 - 4069.14] P:2055.92 E:0.088975 |  Schweinsteiger tries a shot! Oh just wide James I think had it covered in the cricket
[4069.14 - 4074.38] P:1988.65 E:0.088835 |  England are 100 for two with 28 overs left leading another 113 to win the
[4074.38 - 4078.10] P:1880.39 E:0.087336 |  match in the series against Australia Chris Wadden. Well that was a shot again by
[4078.10 - 4080.78] P:1793.98 E:0.108781 |  Schweinsteiger after a close-over was running into far post was going to get a
[4080.82 - 4085.46] P:1888.20 E:0.086836 |  slip it's like a simple tap in for Friedrich and he's all box. It's not about Becken
[4085.46 - 4091.82] P:1996.47 E:0.074132 |  though huh? Well Germany at full stretch at times defensively against England
[4091.82 - 4095.50] P:1897.88 E:0.088553 |  Rooney got away from his marker really well then and now here comes Defoe
[4095.50 - 4099.62] P:1976.31 E:0.084356 |  Jermaine Defoe finds Milner down the England right Rooney's in the penalty
[4099.62 - 4102.38] P:2017.89 E:0.083056 |  area Cross doesn't come in it should have done really from Milner there's a
[4102.38 - 4106.46] P:2021.68 E:0.093653 |  lazy ball by Milner and now Milner and Johnson trying to take care of Podolski
[4106.46 - 4110.58] P:1991.00 E:0.083271 |  Johnson Lampard's appealing for the free kick but Germany come on a counter attack
[4110.62 - 4114.62] P:2017.91 E:0.084396 |  once more to one they lead the dangerous Ursul onto Kedira the two young
[4114.62 - 4118.30] P:1934.67 E:0.088996 |  players have come into the side back again to Ursul calling for it over on the
[4118.30 - 4123.42] P:2034.52 E:0.083194 |  far side is Thomas Muller it's now with Boateng the left back is try shot here
[4123.42 - 4127.62] P:1921.91 E:0.081488 |  and he needs to bother that's gone a long way into the fans behind David James's
[4127.62 - 4131.38] P:1976.94 E:0.087781 |  goal we've played 18 and a half minutes in the second half Germany to England one
[4131.38 - 4133.82] P:1812.88 E:0.097689 |  that was a half-time school. I think what you said earlier in the second half
[4133.82 - 4137.70] P:1835.96 E:0.095497 |  mate next goals vital Germany get it you got to say they'll go on and win it if
[4137.74 - 4142.86] P:1989.64 E:0.087231 |  England get it after England could call and win it. Well here comes the first change for England
[4142.86 - 4147.30] P:1954.50 E:0.078827 |  and Joe Cole who told me a couple of days ago he doesn't mind if he only gets on
[4147.30 - 4152.22] P:1981.41 E:0.074930 |  for a minute he'll give everything and he's coming on here for James Milner so
[4152.22 - 4156.82] P:1971.37 E:0.082014 |  Joe Cole let's just see where he's going to play he's gonna play in Milner's
[4156.82 - 4162.54] P:1956.99 E:0.076523 |  position is he down the right hand side yep so Joe Cole on for England Harry
[4162.54 - 4165.66] P:1952.71 E:0.100048 |  Rednapp I can see just a few yards away of course he's being linked with Joe Cole
[4165.94 - 4171.66] P:1927.10 E:0.087979 |  trying to sign him for spurs next season so the first change of the game sees Joe Cole
[4171.66 - 4176.26] P:1963.68 E:0.085795 |  who'll be bright and bubbly and here he comes now for the first time. Mustn't try too hard
[4176.26 - 4180.82] P:2014.09 E:0.083657 |  though Joe Cole. Cole taking German defenders with him and now Lampard to the far side of the field
[4180.82 - 4185.28] P:1943.54 E:0.081287 |  looking for Gerard the bounce is awkward that's the problem with this ball normally that would
[4185.28 - 4188.38] P:1958.68 E:0.077188 |  have found the feet of Gerard who's acknowledging Lampard's attempt and it's
[4188.38 - 4192.30] P:1861.45 E:0.088515 |  out of play for a German throw in and we played nearly 20 minutes of the second half
[4192.34 - 4196.58] P:1873.23 E:0.077572 |  well England have had some good pressure but they haven't been able to make it count here
[4196.58 - 4203.34] P:1842.96 E:0.078929 |  and remember denied a perfectly good equalizer in the first half England looking to go forward
[4203.34 - 4207.30] P:1966.87 E:0.081750 |  once more I'm just wondering how much longer Defoe will stay down there he's not getting much
[4207.30 - 4212.10] P:1936.87 E:0.079842 |  change against these German defenders they have Heskey they have Crouch of course as a possible
[4212.10 - 4217.62] P:1951.61 E:0.071066 |  alternative now it's Johnson of England Johnson moves the ball to Joe Cole just in front of
[4217.62 - 4222.10] P:2003.11 E:0.081703 |  Fabio Capella good ball in field to Lampard now Lampard's ball was a nothing one you thought
[4222.10 - 4227.14] P:2004.36 E:0.079516 |  Joe Cole would continue his run and out comes Neuer once more in the German goal to make the
[4227.14 - 4230.74] P:1883.55 E:0.102128 |  save to onto Germany you want to keep the tempo up but you've just got to relax when you get
[4230.74 - 4235.70] P:1929.62 E:0.078076 |  the ball you know they're trying to force it don't try and force it keep the tempo up better
[4235.70 - 4240.34] P:1945.64 E:0.087190 |  ball from Lampard this time Joe Cole now hending down this near side lovely ball in field to Rooney
[4240.34 - 4244.90] P:2069.47 E:0.092447 |  Rooney's looking for Gerard perhaps to make a run oh he was blocked there by Friedrich who's
[4244.90 - 4250.92] P:2002.12 E:0.086487 |  already on a yellow card in this game remember that was a cynical professional foul ready from
[4250.92 - 4256.16] P:2018.31 E:0.085583 |  Friedrich and England have a free kick now remember Lampard struck the crossbar from much
[4256.16 - 4261.24] P:2011.52 E:0.079970 |  further out and now can Lampard get the goal that he should have been given in the first half
[4261.24 - 4269.76] P:1950.39 E:0.073086 |  should have scored hit the bar in the second third time lucky for Frank well he took a free
[4269.76 - 4275.52] P:2004.23 E:0.079193 |  kick in the first half which went straight into the German wall Neuer who hasn't been always
[4275.56 - 4281.88] P:1988.78 E:0.080170 |  convincing in the German goal stands by his near post England have got everybody forward
[4281.88 - 4288.92] P:1999.17 E:0.069225 |  apart from Ashley Cole free kick for Lampard needs one of his better ones here Lampard
[4288.92 - 4293.04] P:2147.41 E:0.093711 |  straight into the German wall once more Barry steps in for England he's floated on the edge of
[4293.04 - 4297.76] P:2016.85 E:0.097519 |  the area by Lama now the break is on for Germany if they measure the pass right they find Podolski
[4297.76 - 4302.20] P:2077.98 E:0.093103 |  England a stretch to bid here it's Schweinsteiger Schweinsteiger for Germany trying to release
[4302.72 - 4309.24] P:2010.45 E:0.100081 |  Mullah Mullah's on site can finish England oh he has gone Thomas Mullah on the counter
[4309.24 - 4315.36] P:1857.29 E:0.101896 |  attack fed by Schweinsteiger has probably now put this game beyond England despite all of the
[4315.36 - 4322.36] P:1991.72 E:0.093085 |  pressure in the second half Mick Jagger's here today I'm afraid it could be all over now
[4322.36 - 4327.40] P:1994.89 E:0.096645 |  but tell you what why don't you leave three but you know he's gonna hit the target with a free
[4327.40 - 4332.08] P:1950.18 E:0.095984 |  kick I try to hit the target who've got one back on the half wheeling in the three plays you did
[4332.08 - 4336.36] P:1893.57 E:0.097879 |  want a break for Germany well it's real come away with it and Mullah probably being the best player
[4336.36 - 4344.56] P:1902.42 E:0.083330 |  in the park today great finish it was always gonna happen pressure pressure pressure from England
[4344.56 - 4352.36] P:1928.75 E:0.083237 |  classic breakaway and Mullah who's been such a handful for England throughout the game scores to
[4352.36 - 4357.36] P:2006.82 E:0.093417 |  make it 3-1 to Germany and is at any way back we're moving towards the halfway point of the
[4357.36 - 4362.76] P:1916.54 E:0.085588 |  second half as Gerard now tries to release Ashley Cole we said the next goal was vital the
[4362.76 - 4368.48] P:1980.24 E:0.081922 |  controversy of the lampard goal not given in the first half halfway point of the second half Alan
[4368.48 - 4377.52] P:2005.23 E:0.072401 |  Green well I'm not giving up on this yet there's still 22 and a half minutes and by the way in
[4377.52 - 4383.24] P:1957.42 E:0.086609 |  the last few minutes of Mike's commentary we've been told officially here that the referee on
[4383.88 - 4392.40] P:1948.81 E:0.082069 |  seeing images of the lampard effort in the first half responded by saying oh my god so at least
[4392.40 - 4401.08] P:1968.39 E:0.074455 |  he knows a rickett was made but it's 3-1 now no point dwelling too much on that lampard effort
[4401.08 - 4408.20] P:1989.13 E:0.078040 |  Germany certainly have a huge advantage Johnson lost the ball there when he really shouldn't have
[4408.20 - 4413.56] P:1901.63 E:0.078793 |  done Kedira forward Johnson gets in makes a tackle still can't get the ball back for England

[4424.24 - 4429.52] P:2005.06 E:0.085151 |  whether they go in I would change it now I'd get Husky or Crouch on now and you bet them I was
[4429.52 - 4433.40] P:2024.18 E:0.094092 |  I would kick and rush we can't play mid football the teams you may as well put a target up there
[4434.04 - 4440.60] P:1847.91 E:0.083060 |  it's as well that that was a slight shot from Muller Grand Taylor I have to say this that I think
[4440.60 - 4445.80] P:1849.40 E:0.088934 |  Mullah has been Germany's best player I think the intelligence of them and for such a young man as
[4445.80 - 4450.72] P:1794.23 E:0.084991 |  well has been excellent England have a hard task now ahead of them there's no doubt about that
[4450.72 - 4456.88] P:1868.93 E:0.080350 |  here's lampard in a good position back to Barry Barry's past to Jared was awkward Jared crossed
[4456.88 - 4461.48] P:1888.13 E:0.093373 |  it took an affliction off lamb and it's a corner to England I'm not a response by England but
[4461.48 - 4466.68] P:1941.12 E:0.088592 |  they always look dodgy on there they kind of defend this counter attack in Germany I would put
[4466.68 - 4473.00] P:1959.08 E:0.078982 |  somebody on now a front some target go for it Gerard's corner from the left hit right footed
[4473.00 - 4478.36] P:1935.51 E:0.086099 |  deep too deep headed away by Kedira and out of play it goes and I'm looking down Emil haski
[4478.36 - 4487.52] P:1974.54 E:0.063958 |  it will enter the fray very shortly throwing by Johnson at the terror he's done over the attack
[4487.68 - 4493.60] P:1901.57 E:0.092034 |  and then cold with a weak attempted cross cleared by Germany above the halfway line and he's away
[4494.24 - 4500.48] P:2013.22 E:0.096525 |  he's away my goodness Ozil into the penalty here you only have to pull the ball back it's 4-1

[4711.60 - 4715.60] P:1987.89 E:0.087876 |  the ball on the edge of the box you think go they've got so much place going forward
[4718.00 - 4726.24] P:1937.76 E:0.067534 |  throwing goes to Joe Cole and that's a terrible ball from Joe Cole terrible and now it should also

[5188.48 - 5192.32] P:1863.53 E:0.087489 |  the quarter finals Johnson would not be in the team but of course that's a formality it ain't
[5192.32 - 5197.76] P:1975.99 E:0.093228 |  going to happen but he's quick show there Johnson that's his third fold in the last 10 minutes so
[5197.76 - 5204.24] P:2024.35 E:0.084488 |  he's heading for it and he got it the caption on the television monitor says miss his next match
[5205.20 - 5206.32] P:1911.13 E:0.072747 |  as if that matters
[5209.20 - 5217.04] P:1914.25 E:0.067653 |  another change for Germany Kessling yeah a striker well I don't know who do you bring off
[5217.04 - 5219.68] P:1991.83 E:0.096627 |  it's a adult skier I think you may take Ursula off
[5221.68 - 5229.04] P:1963.33 E:0.073567 |  Schweinsteiger for Germany this is painful to commentate on Germany of finishing this game so
[5229.12 - 5237.04] P:1943.21 E:0.067791 |  superior to England into Katera Schweinsteiger again in the center circle Schweinsteiger plays
[5237.04 - 5243.28] P:1936.76 E:0.073929 |  it casually with the outside of his right foot accurately to Podolski into Ozil there are more
[5243.28 - 5250.80] P:1951.98 E:0.066088 |  goals for Germany here if they want them Schweinsteiger back to Boateng Boateng now to Podolski
[5250.80 - 5255.28] P:1974.96 E:0.090939 |  Boateng again Podolski goodness gracious Joe Cole was late there and the referee saw it
[5255.84 - 5260.96] P:1906.79 E:0.082027 |  Podolski to Ozil Johnson in with a challenge that's a far more excited play and I think the
[5260.96 - 5267.76] P:1935.44 E:0.082120 |  Uruguayan referee just having a very quiet word with Joe Cole it is indeed Ozil who's coming off
[5267.76 - 5273.76] P:1996.64 E:0.078323 |  yeah and Kessling Kessling coming on well Ursula me started the first 20 minutes he looked very
[5273.76 - 5278.64] P:2063.67 E:0.100918 |  nervous lost the ball but he's always an influence over this team play he links the play up ever so
[5278.64 - 5285.52] P:1976.32 E:0.085705 |  well it's a very good play and a big big future and they go well Capella may as well may as well
[5285.52 - 5292.24] P:1931.62 E:0.073519 |  send on Beckham in his suit for all the difference it will make England won Germany four on five
[5292.24 - 5300.32] P:1897.28 E:0.067903 |  line seven minutes to go Germany throwing cleared by Johnson out of play and another throw to
[5300.32 - 5307.20] P:1906.84 E:0.076184 |  Germany Boateng to take it why you look at my stopwatch hoping that it's rushing towards the 45 minutes
[5307.28 - 5312.80] P:1908.89 E:0.080163 |  because I think Germany's gonna score again here's Ashley Cole on the far side of the field
[5312.80 - 5319.36] P:1940.74 E:0.083155 |  options behind him Cole's under pressure loses the ball that's terrible here's Kessling and then
[5319.36 - 5322.72] P:1888.34 E:0.083001 |  England forced it that Barry made it into reception and gets it back to David James
[5323.36 - 5328.40] P:1837.40 E:0.093429 |  Ashley Cole losing it losing the ball far too easy it's just something to know I know people
[5328.40 - 5334.16] P:1940.13 E:0.087613 |  might say we're all about that was go rightly so it was a goal but I've got to say the best team's
[5334.16 - 5346.96] P:1965.01 E:0.071440 |  winning the number to call to join in 606 0 599 693 padalski great ball into Kessling back to
[5346.96 - 5354.64] P:1920.78 E:0.071431 |  Schweinsteiger in the center circle Schweinsteiger just runs away casually from Barry finds Boateng
[5354.64 - 5361.20] P:1910.26 E:0.073512 |  then Boateng's pass was behind padalski here's Lampard to Gerard that has to be considerable
[5361.20 - 5366.88] P:1865.29 E:0.078768 |  thought given to what England do after this shambles of a World Cup with one decent display
[5366.88 - 5371.12] P:1845.68 E:0.083538 |  against Slovenia semi-decent but remember the standard of the opposition not the highest
[5371.92 - 5378.80] P:1901.20 E:0.075633 |  and ultimately whatever the grumbles about Lampard's quote non-goal we end up being outplayed by
[5378.80 - 5387.04] P:1904.46 E:0.062506 |  Germany my optimism before the game totally misplaced blind faith here's Kadeera Kadeera
[5387.04 - 5393.52] P:1889.62 E:0.077646 |  and Irish finds and on to padalski back to Boateng a little over five minutes ago it's hit up field
[5393.52 - 5399.68] P:1904.43 E:0.069762 |  Upsum was back there and the ball runs through to James and Mick Jagger as Mike was saying
[5400.48 - 5406.16] P:1913.68 E:0.081082 |  watching on was watching on last night in Rustenberg a usn garrings sitting it doesn't
[5406.16 - 5411.60] P:1888.82 E:0.088045 |  bring any team much slope busy now here's Kaisling stay away making future Kaisling a yard outside
[5411.60 - 5417.20] P:1968.28 E:0.084318 |  the penalty area not a good ball to Tchaikovsky Tchaikovsky still gets there beats Ashley Cole
[5417.20 - 5422.24] P:1868.32 E:0.085137 |  easily on the inside up to the edge of the penalty area the pass back allowed by Schveinstegger to
[5422.24 - 5428.16] P:1822.55 E:0.081475 |  reach Kadeera now it's Lampard on the far side of the field Germany leading 4-1 right Phillips
[5428.16 - 5432.32] P:1894.43 E:0.081091 |  will be coming on shortly for England what difference will that make what's the point
[5433.84 - 5440.08] P:1829.52 E:0.072976 |  Schveinstegger on the far side of the field back to the centre serve to the Friedrich Friedrich
[5440.56 - 5444.64] P:1895.34 E:0.084826 |  plays that forward like the most cultured midfield players to the left side of Podolski
[5444.64 - 5450.32] P:1916.41 E:0.084885 |  exchanges passes with Boateng and then he threads it towards Kaisling intercepted by John Terry
[5451.04 - 5455.52] P:1859.50 E:0.084520 |  John Terry has the ball again inside the penalty area back it goes to David James
[5456.16 - 5462.48] P:1831.90 E:0.069611 |  and we've got four and a half minutes to go before the added insult of added time I can't
[5462.48 - 5467.68] P:1917.66 E:0.084479 |  believe what I'm saying I think Germany's a very good say I got to see I said before I don't but
[5469.04 - 5473.76] P:1900.81 E:0.075939 |  England I can't since they went four down they've just they've choked it they've never
[5473.76 - 5477.60] P:1954.44 E:0.094703 |  they've never even put them on any pressure they've never had a go Gerald's had a shot which was a
[5477.60 - 5483.04] P:1895.04 E:0.086671 |  great save apart from that Germany must had last 10 minutes they must had 80 percent of the possession
[5484.08 - 5489.20] P:1854.74 E:0.086003 |  look they've got it again well they've never gone more than 20 years between winning World Cups
[5489.20 - 5497.84] P:1980.63 E:0.078825 |  Germany they won in 1990 who knows here's Gomez forward Gomez steps in the ball inadvertently
[5497.84 - 5503.36] P:1994.21 E:0.088601 |  picked up by Kedira this is shocking for me and then finally the flags up for offside to relieve the
[5503.36 - 5508.64] P:1892.57 E:0.080910 |  pain Glenn comes right Phillips for Glenn Johnson I think probably they're thinking that actually
[5508.64 - 5514.64] P:1847.79 E:0.075562 |  Johnson's only is left by he's that he's trotting off injured that's where he's been turned off
[5514.64 - 5525.52] P:1973.30 E:0.078540 |  by Dossky that many times oh dear oh dearie dearie and you won Germany four we know what we'll do
[5525.52 - 5531.68] P:1902.55 E:0.093477 |  Alan after this we'll go home and we'll say we'll try and say the lensman got it all wrong with a
[5531.68 - 5536.80] P:1960.28 E:0.087020 |  goal but she did and that'll be it and we'll say right what we're going to do and four years time
[5536.80 - 5543.20] P:1907.50 E:0.069895 |  we'll be saying exactly the same thing we'll be going through the same agony as usual except this
[5543.20 - 5548.16] P:1828.05 E:0.081222 |  time we don't even have the quarter finals Chris we're not good enough why do people always build
[5548.16 - 5554.08] P:1805.45 E:0.078202 |  us up and this is swunder team we're not it's a media thing but it's definitely a media driven thing
[5554.08 - 5560.32] P:1889.68 E:0.083005 |  and the players are indulgent they like it as well they talk themselves up we have it we haven't come
[5560.32 - 5568.00] P:1912.99 E:0.071351 |  to South Africa to do well we've come here to win it yeah oh dear it's fine stagger I still don't
[5568.00 - 5572.72] P:1924.03 E:0.080331 |  think this German team will win it right look they've got they've got on the day they've started
[5572.72 - 5576.96] P:1977.24 E:0.092823 |  they've had five players so I'm gonna 21s how many under 21s will we have in this team we're getting
[5576.96 - 5583.04] P:2016.25 E:0.082632 |  this team here's runy who's had a shocking world cup and uh it's tackle easily losing the ball at least
[5583.04 - 5590.64] P:2001.45 E:0.072503 |  it's a corner well you know I hope nobody starts building up Wayne Rooney again next season after
[5590.64 - 5596.80] P:1996.33 E:0.087193 |  this Rooney himself is going to take the corner short to Gerard Gerard edge of the penalty area onto
[5596.80 - 5603.44] P:1973.66 E:0.082446 |  Rooney into the penalty area and Rooney shoots it go blocked a 10th shot a goal by Barry it's blocked
[5603.44 - 5608.08] P:1944.56 E:0.093637 |  two behind for another corner well you just switched off yeah they do what they want it was
[5608.08 - 5612.16] P:1913.69 E:0.096318 |  like saying go and score if you want we still didn't always right Wayne Rooney doing taking the corner
[5612.16 - 5617.20] P:1888.88 E:0.082282 |  in the first place now it's Gerard to take it from the right side lots of red shirts in the
[5617.20 - 5623.04] P:1935.40 E:0.087151 |  German penalty and Rooney just walked in his right but at the ball it's like oh it doesn't matter
[5623.04 - 5627.12] P:1896.09 E:0.095989 |  and he called over the outside he was right but it looked in the air and was caught by Neuer
[5628.80 - 5634.56] P:1938.75 E:0.090199 |  such disinterest but what I'm saying is pitiful and they've got five under 21s or maybe six in the
[5634.56 - 5640.64] P:1887.99 E:0.079300 |  squad right but they've developed their game what it's well it's coaching from young whatever
[5641.20 - 5645.68] P:1957.63 E:0.090682 |  our game's going backwards it's and we keep saying they're sending every tournament we do nothing
[5645.68 - 5651.36] P:2005.05 E:0.077708 |  about it Rooney to Lampard 30 yards out shits a goal save for the goalkeeper
[5652.00 - 5654.56] P:1977.50 E:0.092079 |  well we've had two three chances in three minutes
[5656.00 - 5659.92] P:1954.29 E:0.091886 |  a bit late yeah and also just you know it feels that it doesn't matter Germany or not
[5659.92 - 5665.60] P:2025.15 E:0.083564 |  is your excuse for Germany's Germany's not that interested now no no but what what do you put that
[5665.60 - 5672.72] P:1879.22 E:0.067338 |  Rooney attempt down to I couldn't care less I've done look I'm sure Rooney does care and
[5672.72 - 5676.56] P:1763.00 E:0.087622 |  now the linesman should have had the flag up there against Kiesling it doesn't matter in the end
[5676.56 - 5681.68] P:1836.05 E:0.071107 |  because it's out of play for a throw in we're inside the final minute of the game what will be
[5681.68 - 5688.24] P:1934.40 E:0.073942 |  two minutes oh no I think they'll have at least three just to pour on the agony at least three
[5688.24 - 5694.64] P:1924.10 E:0.081815 |  0500 999 693 is the number to call if you want to chat to me on 606 which will be coming up in a
[5694.64 - 5702.08] P:1928.03 E:0.074251 |  round about a quarter of an hour the England's World Cup is over here in Blum Fonsa you know I
[5702.08 - 5707.84] P:1968.91 E:0.077022 |  watched the result of the two games yesterday and I thought England should have been in that half
[5707.84 - 5712.80] P:1913.85 E:0.087171 |  of the draw they really should have one group say Alan had half an hour 45 minutes maybe against
[5712.80 - 5718.88] P:1897.02 E:0.079098 |  Slovenia that's it that's it passed down the right side to right Phillips right Phillips control
[5718.88 - 5724.40] P:1901.12 E:0.079873 |  was in great then he gets the cross in and it's saved on the air post by Neuer there's the board
[5725.36 - 5730.08] P:2031.01 E:0.083107 |  how many minutes go on you guys will make it four two thank heavens for that
[5731.52 - 5737.92] P:1942.77 E:0.078534 |  thank you very much you're a going into time out it on for stoppages four one to Germany
[5738.48 - 5743.68] P:1861.91 E:0.088014 |  Neuer hits it up field right Phillips allows it to go out of play and there will be a throw in
[5744.32 - 5750.56] P:1992.27 E:0.076163 |  to England and you look around the hundreds of flags that adorn this arena flags of the
[5750.56 - 5756.64] P:1983.33 E:0.080892 |  cross of St George people who spent what thousands of pounds getting here and what have
[5756.64 - 5764.80] P:2005.93 E:0.076292 |  England given up nothing well tell you 45 minutes in probably all action put the whole games together
[5764.80 - 5769.04] P:1951.49 E:0.088317 |  and they probably did 45 minutes of what we expect well that's not good enough out of four matches
[5769.04 - 5776.24] P:1951.95 E:0.084046 |  well 90 minutes of play each time that's 360 minutes 45 good minutes yeah I would say
[5777.20 - 5781.92] P:1905.49 E:0.095823 |  lampard picks it up field it was always ahead of really but normally really would have been
[5781.92 - 5788.32] P:2002.88 E:0.080698 |  rushing after it it bounces through to Neuer and you've only got 60 seconds to count down now folks
[5788.32 - 5793.28] P:1958.81 E:0.092413 |  well I hope you're fine everybody's looking at this we need to change our system and we're not
[5794.16 - 5797.36] P:1890.66 E:0.107206 |  and we'll be saying the same thing in the year old we'll be saying the same thing in Brazil
[5798.64 - 5805.12] P:1923.41 E:0.083267 |  Kedira onto Schweinsteiger and Schweinsteiger runs away from Barry he's approaching the penalty
[5805.12 - 5809.60] P:1929.20 E:0.082696 |  it's a great run by Schweinsteiger he's got Podolski to his left the pass hit right full
[5809.60 - 5814.80] P:1893.53 E:0.081298 |  still reach Podolski back to Schweinsteiger there's still a chance for 5-1 here for Germany back
[5814.80 - 5820.00] P:1890.58 E:0.086462 |  to Kedira and thankfully Kedira turns away from goal initially now it's the boating in the near
[5820.00 - 5825.12] P:1917.03 E:0.085012 |  side of the field Schweinsteiger wants more Schweinsteiger rolling the ball under his right foot
[5825.12 - 5829.44] P:1928.14 E:0.092909 |  he's been quality hasn't he I mean he's a right side in midfield he converted his centre and he's
[5829.44 - 5834.72] P:1949.36 E:0.088158 |  ran the game by an east tackle he's offside oh he's offside he's absolutely ran again with a bad
[5834.72 - 5840.72] P:1980.59 E:0.074720 |  hamstring and that at least that means it's an England free kick and with only seven seconds
[5840.72 - 5847.44] P:1912.23 E:0.085114 |  to go about in time at least we're not going to lose by five goals to one Ashley Cole on the far
[5847.44 - 5854.08] P:1980.71 E:0.097325 |  side of the field the rear ground referee blows his whistle England's World Cup is over it's finished
[5854.08 - 5861.36] P:2021.85 E:0.092301 |  in a dreadful defeat to Germany absolutely shocking England won journey four well I've got
[5861.36 - 5867.28] P:2039.69 E:0.095648 |  to say it's totally embarrassing I think yep you know Germany dominated the first 35 minutes
[5867.28 - 5871.44] P:2001.37 E:0.103050 |  England came back yeah it could have been two two half team well let's be honest Germany ran the game
[5871.44 - 5876.56] P:2051.71 E:0.091587 |  from the off second half first ten minutes England had a goal apart from ourselves 20 minutes 20
[5876.56 - 5880.88] P:2053.01 E:0.088427 |  20 minutes for me in the game England competed and looked like we're going to get there's something
[5880.88 - 5887.28] P:2009.96 E:0.073699 |  for Germany far better team technically tactically absolutely hammered with painful
