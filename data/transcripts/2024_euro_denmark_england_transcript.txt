 And Joachim Anderson of Crystal Palace as well as Pierre-Emile Hoivier of Chotland. And the England team, as I say, unchanged. Pickford, Walker-Stone, Gaye and Trivia. Alexander-Arnolden-Rice, Saka, Bellingham, Thoddon and Kane. But before we get underway for this group-seat match, there is going to be a mark of respect shown to Gerhard Eichner, one serving UEFA General Secretary. It was German who has passed away. And on those screens above the centre-circle, black and white photograph of the face of Gerhard Eichner, 1943 to 2024. APPLAUSE And the players break away now. The Danish players going to a huddle. England are ready to start. Matt Upsen, Conakordi up here with me. Izzy Christensen is down behind the goal. Actually, Jordan Pickford's goal in the first half weeks, walking directly towards Izzy, who's just over the hoardings. Next to the goal, the Danish fans behind them. A wonderful, colourful scene inside the ground. And here we go, England knowing that if they can win here tonight, making two wins out of two, England will be going through as group winners with a match to spare. But it is Denmark, ranked 21 in the world, who are up against them tonight. Bukajosaka kicks off a game, plays it all the way back to Pickford, who hits the long pass through the middle, and then Denmark firing away downfield, and here's Rasmus Hoiland. As the pitch cuts up quite significantly actually there, there's Walker Chaserson. Denmark played into the edge of the area, a low shot from the edge of the box, from Hoibier of Tottenham, but that straight of Pickford is able to deal with it easily. I mean, that's a massive chunk of turf that has just scooped out of the pitch. He's really has chunked up there from Karl Walker, as he just put the brakes on. But a little indicator of what Hoiland brings to Denmark, that's a bit different. He has that running power. He'll work the channels as much as he can. Yeah. Rasmus Hoiland, who ended the season, out of the Manchester United team, he was being used as a substitute. But he was Denmark's top scorer in qualifying. England give it away, Alexander-Arnold, passing it straight to Victor Christensen. Now the ball through the middle to Hoiland, but it comes back, and now he has Harry Kane. As the ball is given to him, he just scoops it forward, and he has a first chance for Bukajosaka to show what he can do, but the cover is there. From Hoibja, who's able to just tackle it out of play. Take it off the toe of Bukajosaka. Interesting there. When England got the chance, Kane got the chance. Immediately look into Saka. He's looking to Saka, but Conor just gave me a nudge to have a look at the centre-backs, and Christensen has gone across to the left-hand side, so he's actually started with Vestergaard in the middle, which I think is purely because of that, John. Christensen, you say, is probably a little bit more mobile, a bit lighter on his feet, more able to deal with those one-on-one situations that England are looking to put Bukajosaka into all the time. It's White Shirts, Blue Shorts and White Sox for England tonight. Saka to Walker, but Walker slips as he crosses, and there's another huge section of turf that has come up as Walker slipped, and the pitch surface does... Well, I mean, the evidence suggests it's very, very soft. It's just Walker, though, isn't it? Too much horse power has been into the ground, I think. It's just shirt and the grass up. Yeah, but that is off. You know, we were told to look out for the pitch the other night when we were in... Where were we? Düsseldorf. Yeah. And it's held up OK, but already tonight, this is a little bit of a concern, as Alexander Arnold has to scoop the ball back to Pickford. Halfway inside his own half, and Pickford goes for a long, long left-footed pass, out towards the left-hand side. Good deal of scrutiny on Phil Thornton tonight, and he's right over there on the left-hand side in these early stages. It was noticeable against Serbia how he was very central right from the off. Yeah, I think having that with talking about maybe not being good enough with the ball or happy with keeping the ball well enough, you've got to make the pitch big, haven't you? Use the full width, and I think those wide players, Foden and Saka, really crucial to that. And they really are stationed as wide as can be, Foden on the left and Saka on the right. Just great space, John, doesn't it? Kane can drop in, midfield players can have the ball. I think controlling the game is something that England will want to do well today. This is Five Live and BBC Sounds, live from the city of Frankfurt, the medieval and modern city of Frankfurt, with Gay on the ball for England in the centre-circle. Mark Gay winning his 13th cap tonight, the Declan Rice, who's winning his 53rd. And here's Tribya, who we should mention as well, who is winning his 50th cap tonight, but acrossfield pass, looking for the other pullback, Karl Walker was over-hit by Kieran Tribya, and it drifts out of play for a throw on the halfway line to Denmark. I think some turf chunked up in the middle of the pitch as well. I mean, this is actually going to be really interesting, because it's just lying on top of the surface. So if a ball is rolling along and it hits, it's really going to bump up in the air. Well, I mean, we have had very heavy rain here, as has been the case all over Germany over the past couple of days or so. The roof is closed tonight, this sort of canopy-style roof. And I wonder whether the pitch was actually a factor in the closing of the roof. Yeah, it must have been, because I think when Gary Flint's off here a couple of days ago, they actually closed it during the downpour, didn't they? So I think that probably would have been the reason, John. Here's Morton Kuhlman in centre midfield. One of the youngsters in this Denmark line-up of Kaspar Kuhlman, the coach. It was the coach at the semi-final three years ago, and in Kato, when they were disappointing, went out at the group stage, finished bottom of the section. Denmark, red shirts, white shorts, red socks, so their first choice colours as well. Now Victor Christensen on the left-hand side, Victor Christensen back-centrally. Over here it comes to Christian Ericsson, who scored the opening goal in their first match, low-balling towards the edge of the area from Kuhlman. But England deal with that, and it's just stabbed back to Stones on the edge of the penalty area now to Walker on the right-hand side, and Walker, where the inside of his right boot, a careful pass to Bukajosaka in England, start again from inside their own half. As Stones, there's the whistling from the 16,000 Danish fans who are here in Frankfurt for this. Now Declan Rice, just inside his own half, passes it over the half-way line at close quarters to Trent Alexander-Arnold. If you've just switched onto it, if you're on your way home, just leaving work, it is nil-nil, and England are unchanged for the same team. That's given away by Walker. Now Christian Ericsson, former teammate of Kyle Walker, is at Tottenham, and then Walker into the challenge that bounces out of play for what is given as a throw-in to England, which is disputed by the Danes. Mark Gehr, he started positively again, made a really good decision moments ago, just to step in and deal with the situation. He really is being proactive with his positioning, reading of the play. He's been very good at the start of this game as well. Five minutes played, let's bring in Conor Coddie, who is in Garren Southgate's last two squads at the tournament. What have you made of the start, Conor? I think England are in control of the ball, they're doing it well, but I think Denmark are showing what a back-five does for you. It solidifies, it gives you a little bit of control without the ball, and I think you can see they're not chasing the ball too much, they're sitting in that little mid-block on the way of England to make a mistake. Like we've seen with the crossfielder pass before from Kieran Tripp, so very steady start, but England in control. Yeah, it's a real flat-back-five, isn't it, for Denmark? And the more Walker slips again, again, more turf comes up on the right wing, as he slams the brakes on. And you know, this pitch surface now is actually quite choppy. Alexander-Arnold's ball over the top, there's too much on that, and the ball skips through to Casper Schmeichel. Yeah, it's the run that Saka loves, though, isn't it? That out to him. If Alexander-Arnold could pick the right pass with the right weight, he just gets that little run, and it's very much Victor Christensen, who's dropping all the way back in that left-back position and leaving the other Christensen, the centre-back, a little bit narrower, so the space for Saka isn't quite there maybe to get it wide, and he's got to beat two players at that point, so that little run inside could be on. This match is all over the BBC tonight. BBC One, if you get home, Game Over, and Alan Shearer are not far away. They're far away from us here, and with it being a BBC live match, you can actually sync up the radio commentary, if you wish, with the TV pictures and continue listening to us. Just look for five live euros extra on the iPlayer or the website or the app, on the Smart Speaker as well, and indeed there's also a Jamie Johnson option with our old friend Conor McNamara doing that. Denmark in possession, ten yards inside the England half. Huybier now, looks for a ball out towards the right-hand side. Mela catches up with that near the dead-ball line. Trippie comes in with a challenge, and as he just flicked it away from him, Trippie out his court. The Danish supporters don't like that. He's given by the assistant on the far side, pre-kicked to England. Yeah, good ball across, but Trippie does well. Tries to keep it in there, but he just nicks the ball in front of him and wins the foul and takes the sting out of the situation. I think somebody's just gone scampering out of the England bench-junk. It's going to get a new pair of boots, possibly, for Carl Walker. I don't think he's too happy with the footway, with all the slipping going on. And Kieran Trippie are very much winning that free kick. We were talking to Alan Sheerat this morning about Kieran Trippie and whether he might have had an issue at the end of the match, and he suggested that perhaps that was out of the usual Newcastle playbook. What happened at the end of the Serbia match? Now, Carl Walker, who Matt mentioned, who has been struggling with his boots and slipping on the pitch, he has actually sat down on the field. And whether he's tweaked something or whether he's actually just... ...taking a bit of time, and it does actually look as though he might have turned his ankle as the pitch gave way beneath him, according to the pictures we're seeing. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he certainly put a lot of weight on that outside of the foot. He slipped fully as the turf just chunked up in the air, and he really did put a lot of weight on his ankle when it was rolled over. Let's go down pitch site. Is he Christensen? Yeah, I've just seen Carl Walker signalling to Jordan Pickford when England won that free quick with Trippie that he needed to go down. He dropped and sat down, and it's given themselves the opportunity to get him off and get him into different boots. Cos, like you say, Matt and John in commentary, the pitch is starting to be a real factor, which wasn't during the warm-up, but it's good that Carl Walker can address that and hopefully can be back on the pitch any minute now. Yeah, so he's off the field at the moment, and he is changing his boots. So it would appear that he is coming out of the field, but he's out of position, so Trent Alexander-Arnold, of course, is the ideal man out on the field in midfield to slip back into the right-back position. Walker still is working away. He's got one boot on. He's got the other boot on now. He's tying his laces. Denmark Nill. England Nill is the score. And Denmark in possession. Hoipir with a pass over the halfway line, then it comes in field through the middle bit, given away by the pass of Hulman and England now, are on the move forward with Jude Bellingham. Not really seen in the action yet in the match. The man who scored the opening goal of the tournament, the winner against Serbia. Great deal of talk about him. He was the focus of attention yesterday when everyone was doing their talking, and here he is again. Jude Bellingham, 20 years old, 21 in, well, nine days' time on the 29th of June. Fordham now on the left-hand side. Fordham with a ball in field towards Alexander-Arton. Kyle Walker has now been allowed back onto the field, and it looks as though he's OK. A little bit of concern after he went over on his ankle. Like he comes to Mark Gay, and across to John Stones. There he evens start to the match. It's been that one comfortable save from Jordan Pigford. Here is now Saka on the right-hand side, up against Victor Christensen. A ball in fit, and then Bellingham is eased over. That looked like a shove in the back from Hoipir. And he's just tapped the ball out of play. He's very sportsman-like. That was very sportsman. Wasn't it? I think Jude Bellingham was on the floor, but it wasn't a problem with him. He could have easily just driven on with the ball there. How odd! Hoipir, and he just rolls it out. It was a fair challenge for him. Now, if he wins the ball, Bellingham goes to ground, and in my book, that's just play on. Anyway, plays back into England, giving it back to Denmark, still 0-0. And it is Denmark, who are playing from right to left, so they're attacking the end where the Danish courts are. What a noise is coming out of there as they begin to bob up and down together. And here's Andreas Christensen with a long pass through the middle towards Hoiland, who very nearly got away from Mark Gay, who did extremely well to recover, but actually the offside flag goes up. That's that run, isn't it? Talked about Hoiland before, what he brings different to this team, and he will stretch people. Just a little bit of an uneven line there, and Hoiland gets between stones again. Yes, he's a fraction offside, but I don't think Gay really quite knew his position. He was a little bit more advanced than John Stones. Here is Kyle Walker, who's got the right boots on now. Doesn't slip over this time. Checked back, gives it to Alexander-Arnold, who goes one of those passes. High out towards the left-hand side, by Trippier, takes it down with his right foot, plays an aerial ball into the penalty area to Bellingham, who pulls it down with the top of his shoulder, and then takes it back out into the full-back area, back to Trippier on his right foot, Bellingham receives it. Now he is folding on the edge of the box. It's the first time we've seen England really getting into their stride in the defence of third of the games. Walker, then to Saka, right corner of the penalty area, just outside the box, comes back to Alexander-Arnold. Saka again, but this is all rather static, and indeed the ball-mormos comes to a stop at the feet of Bukhaya Saka. Rice, back out to Walker. Walker's low ball into the edge of the aerial, Foden. Foden beats his man, he's into the area, a right-foot shot, wide of the top-left corner, so often this season. We've seen Foden do exactly that, and get into the penalty area and bury it, but that was promising. That's exactly what we want to see from Phil Foden. The position where he picks the ball up becomes all the way across, past the middle of the pitch, picks it up more on the right-hand side. The first little bit of footwork was lovely, just shot around the player, because I think he could have took it straight onto his left foot for a shot, but then he comes back onto his right, and it's hard to open his body up again onto his left foot, to curl it into the far post. He's always leaning to one side, and the ball just rises over the crossbar, but better from England than pass. And I think Trent Alexander-Arnold had one chance to maybe just put that cross in early, got set back to go on his right foot, in a lovely position with his quality, just sticking in the box. You've got Jude Bellingham arriving, waving his hand in the air, Harry Kane's in there, put the Danish defence under pressure and make him defend a good cross. Still no-nail, but that's the first proper opportunity for England. Phil Foden just inside the box, opening his body, but shooting wide at the top left corner. Alexander-Arnold, that was awkward. That was given to him by Sacher at waist height, but a lovely touch, actually, with the ball. And then Sacher chases after it, and he's eased over by Victor Christensen. But referee Suarez Diaz says no free kick. Take the throw, Denmark, which they do, back to the edge of the penalty area. But as well, with Foden, I'm thinking that that's how it's supposed to work. Foden at one moment is wide out on the left-hand side, but then making the right decision went to come in. Yeah, but when England are building up with the ball from the back, you want him wide. So he'll be on the touchline, but if the play is in general, he's drifted over to the right-hand side, then he's got that freedom to come into the pitch and pick the ball up exactly where he did, which is where he does a lot of his damage. Mala over on the far side, who was involved in the semi-final three years ago. Five of that team are starting for Denmark today. Six of the England team, lots of familiarity. It's Andreas Christensen, the former Chelsea man, who's had a good season at Barcelona, plays it forward. But that's won back by Walker, and then Sacher's pass, took a deflection. So it's going to be a throw-in on the half-way line. I think he's OK. Walker, I think it was just the boots, wasn't it? I think he went down with the injury, shall we say, to be able to change the boots, and he then had to come off because it was going to take so long to change the boots, but thankfully there was nothing wrong in terms of him physically. Yes, Kyle Walker. If you heard the football daily this morning, Conor Caudi had a chat with him yesterday. I'm sure it's still on there. It was all very, very friendly. They were on the same... Conor got a tremendous welcome from Garret Southgate and Kyle Walker, and it was very much we are-wulf-driven, the interview. Here is Alexander-Arnold in the centre-circle. Alexander-Arnold right for the ball. He was looking for the pass-out to Caudi, but that was right onto the chest of Maylatt. So Denmark have the ball again inside their own half. 15 minutes played then. Still Denmark nil, England nil. And if you just got out of work into your car earlier, it finished Slovenia one, Serbia one in our early commentary match. The game was played in Munich, and that means that if England win this match, they will finish top of the group. Denmark have given it away. Schmeichel played it out, Rice is onto this. Rice on the edge of the area. Back it comes to Kane, onto his left foot. Kane with the shot, but that's blocked on the edge of the box by a falling Joachim Andersen. And Kane very nearly found the spot that he wanted there to take the shot. It all comes from the pressure of Declan Rice. Goes all the way in, just like you see him do at Arsenal. That high pressure forces the error, turns the ball over, ends up with Kane, but I think it was Andersen, wasn't it? Just came narrow and just got a block off of Kane's left foot effort. Yeah, he was just beginning to lick his lips there, and he came just outside the D. He was lining it up, wasn't he? Yeah, bit like those werewolves. You're ahead of the curve on this werewolf feet, right? Conor, I think he was playing it ahead of you. He's got the app and everything on his phone. He's already mentioned that. He's been reshaged before he got out of here. Yeah, he's ahead of the curve. It's all about the homework. Here is England in possession inside their own half. Alexander-Arnold comes under pressure, so plays it back to Nart G, who goes for long pass, just chips it here to Kyle Walker. And England forward towards Bukalio Saka, then infield, for Bellingham, who lays the pass forward. But in fact, Walker is on to Christensen. Walker's into the box. Walker pulls it across, double-deflicks it. Kane, left foot in, it goes, and England have the lead. Brilliant from Kyle Walker. Victor Christensen was asleep, and Kyle Walker took full advantage. A couple of ricochets, and then the man pounces. The England number nine, the captain, the record scorer. He scored at the World Cup in Russia. He scored at the Euros at Wendry. He scored at the World Cup in Qatar. And now he's off the mark here in Germany. The Bayern Munich man makes it Denmark, nail England one. Well, it's just great for him, Kyle Walker. He's not half asleep. He knows what he wants, and he goes for the ball. He just gambles really. And it's Victor Christensen, who thinks he's got the situation under control, the Danish left wing back. I mean, he sees Saka, he's got no idea that Kyle Walker is on the outside of him, charging down the pitch to try and win the ball. And he just steps in at the last second. I mean, it must be a real shock to Christensen. He has no clue he's there. Walker with his head up, the pitch caves in again. I mean, he very nearly lost the ball as the pitch ripped up. The turf came off as he crosses it into Kane. It ricochets into the path of Harry Kane. It can't be any better. He's a little bit fortunate, really, the way the ball ends up on Harry Kane's left foot. But he's six yards out with half the goal to Amat, and he just sides-footed it. He's not going to get many easier finishes than that, but it's just about the pressure from Kyle Walker that makes the opportunity happen. Denmark, Neil, England one, that's bringing Conor Codie for a view on that. It was not pretty defensively, Conor. No, no, not at all. But let's look at it from England points of view. I thought he was outstanding from Kyle Walker to keep his run going down the line there and just pick pocket Victor Christensen a little bit, and then obviously a little bit of looking. I didn't like Mattie said, he doesn't want an easier chance. Does he keep his goal in the Euros? Is he a good start at Brigham, then let's hope he can pick on now. So there we are, Harry Kane extends his record. That's 13 goals now that he scored at World Cups and at European Championship tournaments, extending the record for an England player. Long ball downfield for England to deal with. Stones is under that. Here's Walker, Walker, who I would have thought should get an assist for that goal, even though there were deflections involved. Victor Christensen, who is the man caught out, Alester City man, receives the ball on the left-hand side. Christensen looks for the cross, it's come off, walk advances into the penalty area, then the cross from Christian Eriksen, but that's blocked. And then Bukai Osaka in his own penalty area controls and hits it away downfield. So in the first match, England scored in the 13th minute, and they've got a goal in the 18th minute here. We said, didn't we, Matt, at the start of this tournament, it is absolutely not rocket science, but how important it was for Bellingham and Kane to contribute in England's first two goals, goalers at the tournament, Bellingham and Kane. As England go out to Naila on the right-hand side, Denmark, who took the lead in the semi-final three years ago, but England won here in Frankfurt. England have taken the lead in this second group match, and it is Denmark though in possession. And it is Andreas Christensen. Now over there to the right-hand side, to Joachim Andersen. Naila again on the right flank, back to Joachim Andersen. England have dropped right back in possession on the edge of the area. Excellent challenge from Reiss. Then in comes the challenge that ricochets back into the England penalty area. Trippie battling for it, which he does against Maila, and then clears it downfield, and rather politely, the offside flank goes up. Even though Trippie was involved in quite the puzzle there, and eventually the Black Country need to create a lead to England, who lead 1-0. I think seeing England after we score, how we behave, what positions we take up, how we can then settle the game down a little bit, or even be more aggressive and not allow Denmark to have a reaction. I think that's the important thing in the next few minutes, as I look at the tackle on Declan Rice a moment ago, it really gets clattered up in the air, and again, massive chunk of turf all over the pitch, and Trippie are using his body really well, actually, as he has to kind of manoeuvre his way into the ball. Jordan Pegford goes long looking for Kane, but Andreas Christensen wins that, and here is Christian Eriksson through the middle. And then a little pass up towards Vint, now Maila on the right-hand side. Infield, it comes to Morton Hulman, no relation to the coach. Caspar Maila with a cross into Trippie, that bounces out of play for a throw in 10 yards away from the corner flag. That's down in the Danish section, where all of those red flags with the white cross are hanging at various points around the two tiers, in amongst all of the colourful livery of Euro 2024. Throw in taken, Daringham, just a heavy touch from him, so Vint has it on the right-hand side, goes for the cross for the outside of his boot, but it's blocked away by Daringham, a play for a throw in to Denmark, 10 yards back from the corner flag. Maila takes it, back to Joachim Andersen. Joachim Andersen takes that down, knocks it in field, and Christian Eriksson thought about the ball into the area, in fact goes cute, now it bounces out back towards the edge of the box. Christian Eriksson again, goes past Alexander-Arnold, then shoots, deflected up in the air, half-headed away by Reiss, bounces near the penalty spot, Saka heads it further away, but only back to Denmark, and then Vint, the Christensen's ball across the penalty area, was blocked out for a throw on the left. Yeah, a bit of pressure on England. The Danish fans really getting up behind their team. They've not really got hold of the ball since England scored, and they do need a bit of time and a bit of a passage of play, of just possession, just to ease things a little bit. It's just balancing the game, kind of managing the game better. That was poor from Denmark, heavy touch from Hoibje, and it bounced out of play for a throw for England, 10 yards away from their own corner flag. So far so good for England, midway through the first half. England leading through that left foot, six-yard finish from Harry Kane, his 64th goal for England, in what is his 93rd appearance for the record scorer, Hoibje Adon. Denmark, since the goal, have responded well. Vint, with his blonde hair, bobbin, plays it in field to Kulman. Andreas Christensen to Joakim Andersen. Now Mailer on the right-hand side, just gets away, finds a bit of space. Christian Eriksson drops deep, he's found space as well, and then just rolls the pass back towards Mailer on the right-hand side. Joakim Andersen puts his foot on the ball, now Hoibje with the pass out to Mailer on the right. Mailer came into the Danish side, cross from Joakim Andersen into the penalty area, which is headed down, but John Stones was doing his job there against Vint, and it was a weak header down straight at Pickford. Yeah, it was, it was a horrible ball to deal with, I have to say, does well, Stones, because he knows he can't edit, because he can't move his feet and then jump to head the ball. He's just got to use his body back into the centre forward and just stop him getting a clean header, and he does that really well, John Stones. So Rice now just walking the ball away from his penalty area, up towards Saka. Declan Rice has a look, there is a run from centrefield from Bellingham. Rice tries to find him, Kasper Schmeichel comes out to the extreme left of his penalty area, and is able to field the bouncing ball, just under-arms it out quickly. Kasper Schmeichel, 37 years old now, Kasper Schmeichel, a grand old man of the Danish team, winning his 103rd cap tonight. Still not as many as his dad, who is up here in the stand with us. Mailer on the right-hand side, Mailer's pulled down into the full-back position. Joakim Andersen. Now back again towards the half-way line, Hoidea, Christian Eriksen. Denmark have really had most of the possession since England took the lead, but in comes the challenge from Tripp, however that bounces back to Joakim Andersen, and then back into the centre-circle where Janak Vestegard, the other Leicester man in this starting line-up. And now Christian Eriksen on the edge of the area, trying to find a position. England players dive in, stretch away from Rice, and then very calm. Lovely footwork on the edge of his own penalty area for England from Jude Bellingham. That was classy, just to snuff out the danger as England come with Saka through the middle challenge in on him. No, it is given us a free-kick. Any yellow card as well. Cheers from the England fans. Vestegard, yellow carded. That's interesting in the context of the game. Yeah, it is. Vestegard just caught there. Saka had the run, and once he touches the ball past him, he's only ever going to bring him down. It is a yellow card, it's a cynical tack. I think Saka was bursting through the middle, but Jude Bellingham. Every now and then, he hasn't been too active in this game so far, but he does something that you just have to marvel at the way he just shifts the ball. I mean, it was so smooth with it one side to the next. He's got that lovely, poison balance and the ability to move his body weight either side, and then the pass to Saka's wrapped in there is safe side, it's inch perfect. Listen, in 2006, I watched Zinedine Zidane play in this stadium against Brazil, and he was absolutely brilliant, the Real Madrid man, and that, what we've just seen there on the edge of his move, was the right out of the Zidane playbook. One Nell England lead free-kick, which is taken short actually by Trippi, it's Alexander-Arnold. Alexander-Arnold dips it over the top, stretched by Gay, but he couldn't turn it across the six-yard box where Harry Kane was looking, of course, but straight out wide into the side netting for a goal kick. Yeah, I mean, it's been a while since the goal, hasn't it? And England not really being able to be as confident and as authoritative as what they were before the goal in terms of possession, territory, and at the moment, we just, yeah, having to get about the pitch a little bit and defend the edge of the box, and we kind of tend in a little bit. I can almost hear the armchair critics from back home and know exactly what they'll be saying if they're watching this on BBC One. Here is now Andreas Christensen to the centre-circle, to Morton Hulman, who plays in Lisbon for Sporting, just won the lead there with Ruben Amarim, then balled to the edge of the penalty area, flipped away by Forden, comes back to Joachim Aniston, and again the Dains take over, control of the possession, Hoibier, Hoibier up to the corner of the box, still going into the penalty area, and then he has shepherded, no he's not, he's managed to work it across to Pickford, Pickford came for it, didn't get it, the ball rattles across the penalty area and bounces harmlessly back to Pickford, who's able to scoop it up, not terribly convincing from England defensively. It's a hairy moment out of absolutely nowhere, really. I mean, the ball was kept in play brilliantly. He was Hoiland who, Ericsson actually gets across the face of Pickford, who has to kind of break himself from taking him down, then tries to feed the ball in, and ricocheted through the ball, and eventually, trying to Alexander-Arnold, just gets a nick on it, and it rolls back into Pickford, it was a little bit messy. Let's go down pitch side again behind the Pickford goal, is he Christensen? Yeah, there's no coincidence that Denmark are starting to dominate, because that man, Christian Ericsson, he's at the centre of everything that Denmark are doing. I would say that the Danish midfield is dominating so far. They're starting to get a little bit of possession in and around that box, and they're doing really well, but I know exactly what you're referring to, John, with the armchair fans back home, I know what you're thinking, but on that occasion, if I am thinking what you're thinking, Trent Alexander-Arnold, excellent track in the midfield, to just stop Denmark getting through then. Thank you very much, Izzy. Another England international part of our team here, as Guy clears the ball away from inside his own penalty area, which Walker is able to get it down against, Christian Ericsson, then back into the penalty area, the John Stones, across the six-yard box to Pickford, all in yellow, left-footed away towards the goal scorer, Harry Kane, near the half-way line, and then Jude Bellingham is surrounded by red shirts, and Hulmunder's won the ball back, and now Koybjerg. Mailer's got space on the right-hand side, he's one-on-one with Tripp here, in fact, he plays it to Vint inside the penalty area. Jönes Vint back out to Mailer. Mailer's crossed to the back post. Pickford calls for it, comes for it, there was no-one there for Denmark. He went for it, just got a hand to it, and England have dealt with it in the end, and cleared it away. Actually, Walker to Saka, and Saka's off on a run. He's off on a streak up the right wing, but Andreas Christensen comes in with a challenge, and the ball runs away, even though Saka ends up on the ground. Yeah, he was kind of going into a bit of a dead end. I mean, he's getting the ball up the pitch really well there, Saka, but he's just ran out of space, and too many Danish players who are actually really pressing. Well, not given England any time on the ball, we tried to play out just before that, but it was... Every pass was just not quite getting there in terms of the pressure was on, so it was forcing a difficult touch, and then the pass to the next person wasn't quite right, and the Danes turned the ball over, spraying it wide, and then all of a sudden we defended our box as a difficult ten minutes for England. Yep. England leading through that Harry Kane goal that was set up by Kyle Walker, and a couple of ricochets in absolute meet-and-drink to him. As he pounced on the edge of the six-yard box, and buried it away for his first goal at the tournament. He has Mala though, and Denmark have been on top since then. Mala again, he's seen a lot of the ball, Vint on the edge of the area. Back it comes to Hoipjärg, top of the man who's not really played too much, first-burst this season, breaks into the penalty area. Vint for the chance, Gaye comes across, and as the shot was hit, as he slipped Vint, the deflection took it, looping across the face of goal, but it landed on the roof of the net. A good reaction from Gaye. The ball just spins from the middle, I think it's Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a touch, and then it flicks down into the feet of Vint, who's at full stretch, but Gaye has to get across and gets a touch on it, which loops the ball up, and Pickford scrambling towards the back post, thinking it might just loop and drop into the goal, but it just bounces on top of the net. This pitch surface is terrible. Terrible. Terrible. I mean, it's cut him up severely. We didn't see anything in the warm-up, John, it didn't really carve up at all. Not that we'd known this. Anyway, it's a corner. First cut, Ericsson was going to play it in, but the referee blew his whistle, there's some pushing and shoving, so Kyle Walk has been called across, and Andreas Christensen for a telling off for them. The referee's done England a favour there, because it was a well-planned set piece, and they'd created the space. I don't know who it was coming round for the shot, but Ericsson played it kind of towards the penalty spot, and it was ripe for a first-time, ripe for effort, and the referee blows his whistle. They've given the game away. Now we're on to it. Absolutely. So, therefore, Pukajosaka is keeping an eye on Hulman. Ericsson then does take the whistle, it's gone again as it's headed over the top, and the referee's pointing at Walk Christensen. I would imagine. Or Vestergaard. Anyway, the referee was on it, and immediately gave the free kick in, lands away. Yeah, well, they had to play it long into the box then, but the Danes couldn't have been happy with that. I mean, you get one chance to play that kind of set play. They played the card, and the referee blew the whistle. So, it is a free kick then, but Pickford will take, and Rice receives it outside the penalty area, and back it goes to Marguer. You just have a little run forward, and then... He actually then collides with Vint. He'd overrun the ball, bounced away from him, and actually it's given England's way. I think it ricochets off Vint, but Marguer, he's just literally lifted up a chunk of turf and patted it down to his hand. It's like the horse of the year show. I mean, he's overran it. He's not got too many options. Crossfield pass, that's given it away. Now, Victor Christensen. Then he's shot from distances in! What an effort that is! It's the equaliser from Morton Hulman. Best part of 30 yards, it's fizzed low across the turf. Pickford diving down to his right, in off the foot of the post, and Denmark have the equaliser. It's 1-1. What a hit. That is some strike from the midfield player. And it's deserved. Denmark have been far the better team since the goal. Completely dominant, applying all the pressure, and you can just feel that goal coming. But I didn't expect it to be as good as that, John. What a strike. That's a fair way out as the ball comes out to the edge of the box. It's a poor pass from Harry Kane. He's trying to hit a Crossfield ball, but he gives it away cleanly. It gets popped into Hulman, and he pings it with his right foot low. The real driving shot across the goal doesn't touch anyone on the way in, but bangs off the inside of the post and into the back of the net. It's a brilliant hit from the Dane. That ball went into the net, almost under the nose of Izzy Christensen. I'll tell you what, I was right in the far end line behind the goal. What a finish from Hulman, but the shape from England, a loose Crossfield pass, sorry. They just capitalised the Danes and it was coming, as Matt said. They're bringing Connor as well. Connor-Claude, who's here. Yeah, they say, I think you're right, guys. I didn't get the goals being coming. I think Denmark sees the England goal being fantastic. They're playing with a real narrow front clear. Don't know if you've seen it. They're not here. The front clear really narrow, Eric Suen Wins, and obviously Hulman down the middle, and they're just causing England problems, just in between Stones and Trent Alexander-Arnold and Declan Rice and Mark, and no-one knows how to pick them up. It's a massive shift between that of us in possession since we scored the goal. Before that, it's really dominant that you get the goal, but there's a psychological shift that we're not having the ball in the same fashion. Yeah, 100%. I'd just like Denmark into the game a little bit more, unless they've been fantastic since the goal. It was a fantastic goal themselves, but we just need to try and wrestle control back of the game a little bit. All out of play for a throw-in after England are pegged back. Hulman equalising his first goal for his country. Not bad, is it, to get off the mark like that. Best part of 30 yards, and pinpoint into the bottom corner after Harry Kane, England's goal scorer, gave the ball away. Now here's another one forward for Denmark, just after England have conceded at the tournament for the first time. Five-life BBC sounds, Walker over the halfway line. Walker, though, runs into the figure of Christian Suen, who comes out with the ball. Denmark have got their tails up here, Mela then Vint runs away from Rice. Oh, the referee's given the free kick when Mela was running away with the ball at the England defence, and the whistles from the Denmark fans. He's doing us the right favour at the moment, the referee. I mean, he's stopped the play, it ricocheted into the part of Mela's got the run, and it's probably a 2v1 with Poiland making a dart and run into the box as well. I mean, that was an important intervention from the referee from an England perspective. He'll be kicking himself as a professional as a referee. He will know that he should have let it go. So that could have been big trouble for England. We're in trouble at the moment. We've not got to grips with this game, the space that the Danes are having in that area. Ericsson, especially as Izzy said, picking up the ball and the midfield players are completely on top of it, and we're just having to sit off at the moment, we're not able to really get any pressure. Yeah, having opened the scoring in the way that they did, England have just conceded possession, conceded space, they now conceded the goal. So it's 1-1, he has Mela again, and then through it goes to the goal scorer. Hulmand on his right foot again, shoots and that's deflected away by Trent Alexander-Arnold. Far too much space for Hulmand. That's all hands to the pump at the moment. Alexander-Arnold coming across to get the block, but the distance is so vast, he shouldn't be able to pick up the ball there, turn, have a touch out of his feet, and then a challenge comes in. I just think in terms of midfield, we've got to be a little bit tighter, we've dropped off so much because we've got so deep, we've been under pressure, and now the space is there for the Danes to play. England are rocking here, 1-1. Christian Ericsson who created all those chances in the opening match from set pieces. Ericsson to the back post, a stretch in ahead or across, lands on the roof of the net from Joachim Anderson, Pickford stretching high, but was comfortable, and Pickford of all people comes forward and indicates that everyone should just calm down. Goal kick England. Oh, you've got to get hold of the ball, but it looks like it could be one of the short passes onto stones on the edge of the six-yard box, and the Danes are five all the way pushed in, Ericsson's all the way in, and they're more than happy to come and press us in this area of the pitch. Matt Upson played at the World Cup for England, taken short, then Mark win it back on the halfway line, and now Joachim Anderson again. This is concerning for England, concerning for Gareth Southgate, then Mark have scored their goal, and they haven't dropped back, they've carried on as they were before the goal. Although England now forced them to go all the way back to Kasper Schmeichel, left foot from him, over here, but Walker in the air wins that well, bounces across centrally, Foulden comes over, and then then Mark play it out from the back, play it round, Bellingham and Foulden, and now Joachim Anderson, the flying mailer on the right, Trippier tries to get there, the cross is over hit, and just drifts away behind, almost landing in amongst the Denmark fans. It's a goal kick, and it's one-one, and we've got just over five minutes to go to halftime. I think the space that they're finding is the concern for me, they get one or two passes off quickly, but all these efforts, I look at the goal, loads of space, time to get his head up, hit the shot, the second effort that got blocked, too much time to be able to get your head up as a midfield player and strike the ball from the edge of the box, got to get people out and put pressure. Pickford goes along with this, Kane gets the better of Andreas Christensen, tries to head it to Saka, but that's intercepted, and Hoibier is there, this is Tottenham and Arsenal, Hoibier and Saka, and then Declan Reis is able just to take the ball off the tour of Rasmus Hoiling, and knock it back to Pickford. So one-one the score, choice of listening as the Afghanistan-India match on Sports Extra right now at the T20 cricket, as Clodden starts in a run through the middle, he's beaten three men, still going, Kane ahead of him, he goes for goal himself and shoots straight at Schmeichel, who's able to just drop down to his left, and Kane looks at him and suggests, how about the pass to me? He's not that easy, that's as much as it gets from Harry Kane to say, why don't you pass me the ball? He made a run, and I think he felt Foden was just going to slip it to him, but Foden was on a run, he was very much off balance when he hit the shot, it'd been difficult to score from that kind of distance. That was dazzling from Foden, it was, I mean he danced past two or three didn't he? Yeah, and probably felt he had the right to go for it himself, having made the run. That terrific burst, leaving Danish players in his wake, but the shot was straight at Kasper Schmeichel, the underlap man as he is now. Here is Walker in possession, England just need to settle this now. They are in possession, Foden has dropped deep and given it to Walker, Walker and Saka together on the right hand side, back it comes towards Foden again, Foden goes in field towards Bellingham, who certainly not had the influence in this match, due to Bellingham that he had in the first half against Serbia on Sunday night. Alexander-Arnold now through the middle, Foden, this is Denner from England, whistles from the Danish supporters, now back to Dalingham again, and now England have got the ball inside the Danish half, but it feels like we've not seen this for such a long time in the match. Bellingham goes out towards the left hand side and in comes the challenge, bounces back to Trippia. Trippia's ball in the cane on the edge of the penalty area, that bounces off the captain, Rice couldn't get there, actually did well, did well against Vince, so England do keep possession. Bellingham again, over there on the left hand side, flick round the back of his leg, now Foden on the edge of the area, might be space for him, swings it in across the six-yard box beyond Saka and through for Golkin. That's much, much better, control build up, movement off the ball. But where's that been? Yeah, it's been popping it around, well it hasn't been there for 15 minutes or so, has it, since the goal and it's really put us on the back foot, but I don't mind the fact that Foden got his head up there, tried to look for Saka at the back post, it was nearly, nearly a really good ball. That's bringing Conor Caudi again, three minutes, two and a half minutes to the first half to go Conor. Yeah, that was a little bit better John, weren't it? Just having a little bit of control possession, working our way into where he is, getting full fold in the game. I just look at Denmark and they just look really comfortable with him without the ball, don't think they look like they know the formation, they look like they know what they're doing, they look like they're in control of everything that they're doing. So it's just up to England just to again wrestle that ball back again, have a couple of minutes with the ball, especially to half time now, it's important we don't continue another, at least you go into half time drawing the game. Yeah, but England lose it again in centre field, so Denmark have got the ball back and the Danes are just passing it around England here, Hulman, the Danish goal scorer, that Foden has given it away to Hoiland, now Hulman to the right-hand side to Meila, again Hulman, Hypeia picks out Meila, Meila's right foot across towards Hoiland, Gay does extremely well to win the header under pressure from that strong young number nine, Rasmus Hoiland, excellent defensive header from Gay. That was a brilliant header, full stretch, really got up high, I mean people talk about his height, he's not the tallest centre back you've ever seen but he doesn't have to get up well and head the ball. England could do with half time, just as Ericsson from deep to Huland on the edge of the penalty area as Manchester United team it, then it comes back for a curling shot which is straight as Pickford is able to pull it down here, Amiel Hoidjo from round about 25 yards went for the curl, a bit too close to Pickford. They've got to get to grips with Ericsson, he's just pulling strings, he's getting on the ball, he's making moves, he's playing passes, distances, just haven't been there at all from England, we've not been able to really stop the Dains and we've just given the ball away quite loosely. He made it away again so Hypeia gives it to Hoiland who's on the left hand side up against Stones and walk out, Hoiland pulls it across past the two Manchester City men but it's straight at Rice and Rice is in danger of losing it on the edge of the barter law, I think. Did he get the free kick? No he didn't. He didn't get the free kick, he was millimetres away from giving the ball away. Great cheer as the ball is won brilliantly for Denmark by Vestergaard who comes forward and nods it through but Pickford has got it at his feet. We've got 20 seconds of the first half to go and at the moment I think these thousands and thousands of England fans all around this stadium will be thinking and hoping this doesn't get any worse for England before half time. One-one full of promise when Harry Kane gave England the lead in the 18th minute but since then Denmark have dominated Hulman with equaliser and you could argue that they are fortunate that they aren't behind in this match. Walker, here is Bellingham. Kane stating the obvious England need to get Bellingham more involved in the game. Bellingham through to Folder. Now Sacher, little pass to Kane. Kane looks for Sacher but actually keeps possession and he's being followed by Christian Sundtich for Christian Sundtich. Alexander Arnald is caught in possession by Christian Ericsson. Kane is still out here on the right-hand side, Kane turns it in field and then Walker. Declan Rice just forward of the centre-circle, one minute of added time at the end of this first half so just seconds left now but England on the attack. Alexander Arnald on the right. Here is the cross right across the penalty area all the way to Trivia in the full-back position on the far side. Mark Gays joined the attack out there on the left, infield towards Rice. Now it's Denmark defending, final seconds of the first 45 minutes plus. Sacher now on the right-hand side, Sacher turns away from the penalty area, back into Forden on the edge of the box. Forden goes for the call-up but it tips over the top of the crossbar with Kasper Schmeichel standing with his hands wide apart. In the air, knew it was safe and there we are, one-one. That felt like Denmark's half, Matt Upsson. Oh absolutely, so I mean we started really well, looked in control, was passing the ball out, had a bit of structure, had some discipline in terms of our shape and stretching the pitch, get the goal and then honestly John, since that goal it's just been completely different. England have sat off, not been able to get hold of the ball. Denmark's reaction was absolutely brilliant and they've just completely dominated the rest of the first half. Yep, Mark Chapman here in Frankfurt will have many more questions for you Matt and for Conor Cody and for Izzy Christensen. But I think the England players body language as they left the field, I think told the story. They were heads down, they looked a little rattled, I have to confess. And at half-time, here in Frankfurt, Denmark won, England won is the score. You talk about body language, let's go down to Izzy Christensen pitch side because a lot of that first half, I was watching the midfield in particular, but there's a lot of gesturing to each other, there's a lot of arms outstretched, no-one wanted it here, why aren't you pressing there? There's a lot of frustration amongst that England team. Yeah, a lot of discussions happening right inside this 18-yard box, I've been behind Jordan Pickford for that first 45. And the communication between him, John Stones, Declan Rice getting involved, yeah, he's kind of kept out of it, he's been pretty away from it. But there's been a lot of chat, a lot of chit chat, and like you say, Chapman, some negative body language. But Denmark have absolutely suffocated us in the centre midfield and that is why Denmark have started to get on top of us. And half-time is the best thing that's probably going to happen for Gareth Southgate at the moment to get the opportunity to just compose the players again, have the right discussions in there and come out much better than they were in that first. And what I was going to say to you, Matt, even when we were talking about when England did have a bit of possession before the goal, they didn't look anywhere near as fluid and attack-minded as Denmark did when they had that. It's all very well-having it, but there was a lot of sideways back, sideways back. Denmark, at it, and their first thought is, let's break the line. Yeah, absolutely, and they've got somebody in there who's passing balls forward. They're accurate passes, they've got a runner in Hoiland, Mailer on the right-hand side is getting very high and wide and stretching the pitch. But I think there's something about what he said in terms of out-of-possession. You've got Ericsson dropping in there and you have to say he's doing a better job of making those overloads than what we do when we have the ball. And I think we're looking to each other to really kind of see whether or not anyone's going to go to the ball. I don't think we're quite clear of whose responsibility it is to go and put the press. We've not quite got that balance in the midfield. Yeah, I think I completely agree with Marta. What we thought Denmark was going to do was play Chris and Ericsson as a 10 on his own. They're kind of playing with a narrow from three, so Ericsson and Vint are both dropping kind of in a box with the midfield, with Hulman and Hoiberg in centre midfield. So they're killing us with that, so we need to try and make sure we're getting bodies up to the ball to be compact, to stop the ball from in between the line. Big Yannick Bestergaard played some lovely passes through the lines to Vint, and he's been on the half-ten and attacking us with one pass, so we've got to try and get a hold of that, but I think the best thing for us now is half-time, getting regroup, have a chat, see where we're going wrong, and come out with a different mindset at second half. Feels like, from what the three of you are saying here, Matt, that this is more a tactical thing than necessarily a... I know that social media is going, this player, that player, etc. But it's what we talked about pre-match, kind of formations here. If one of you gets it right, you could cause an awful lot of damage to the other one. Absolutely, and I think there is an overload in there. It's not being dealt with. It needs to be addressed, I would say, because there's not enough pressure on the ball. I mean, you can say you're going to be defensive and sit off, and the ball's running around the half-way line, there's no pressure, and that's the way you're going to play. But Danish players like you've just mentioned Vim, Ericsson, the golf scorer, Hümlen, getting on the ball, turning, getting his head up, having a touch, and all of a sudden you can have a shot, there's a pass, there's nobody out there applying pressure, and that can't be right, Conor. Yeah, and the thing with this sometimes, Matt, is that when you just said there about getting up to the ball, sometimes you might not be able to get up to the ball, someone can talk and say, right, we're staying, but you stay compact, you stay together, and you wait for the right times to get up to the ball. We're trying to get up to the ball, and we're a little bit in between at the minute. We're going, and we're half-and-half, and it's just opening up spaces for the midfield. But as a centre-back, you'd be screaming at your midfield players. 100%. But because the best thing for you is that there is pressure on the ball, it allows you to do your job. Without a doubt, yeah. When there's no pressure on it, everyone's uncertain. Without a doubt, and as a defender as well, you want to set that pressure, you want to scream to Harry Kane, right, hold, and now we go. Yeah. Now's the time to go, and then you can step yourself up the pitch. Busy. Do you know what it feels like for that English midfield at the moment? Feels like you're in a tumble dryer. Yeah. You're getting spun around, and that is what Denmark are doing to us. And they need to get a grip of that quickly, and what I've noticed tactically, and one of the reasons why I think Denmark are on top of us at the moment, they're very compact centrally. When they win the ball back, they're switching the plate as quickly as possible, and it's catching England right out of shape, and England need to address that quickly by getting the full-backs in tighter, like Coworker in trippy needs to come in tighter when the ball's on the opposite side, because at the moment England can't deal with the switch. And then the other thing they have as well, Izzy, they do have an outball with Hoyland if he's working the channels, don't they? Particularly if they're not putting pressure on the ball further back in the Danish formation. Yeah, his attitude is exceptional. I've been watching him for this first 45, and he's peeling off onto John Stones, and he's constantly alert. Where's the space? Where is the space? And he's spinning him behind, because he knows in Hoibierre and Ericsson in particular, in the midfield for Denmark, they're going to put the ball into a space with a nice weight on it that he can attack the ball, and it's really challenging England at the back at the moment. It just feels like they have options. If they're not going to spin it in behind, they can get an out wide switch, as Izzy mentioned to Mele, if it doesn't go there, there's a midfield pad, it's found a little space. When you've got the ball as a defender for Denmark, it actually looks like a sweet-shot selection, isn't it, of like, oh, I've got a pass there, I can go wide, I can maybe go long, and there's options for Denmark. And what I will say is that's what that formation does. I've been lucky enough to play that formation in Wolves over the years, and that's what that formation does, it gives you options, and if you're comfortable without the ball, and if you're comfortable sitting in the mid-block, when you get the ball, there's always space to play forward. And this Denmark team have played this formation for years, so they know it inside out, and I think you can see with the first 45 that they do know it inside out. I mean, the other thing at times as well, England played with 12, given the referee. He has done us the favour. Wow, he's made some interesting decisions on two or three occasions, which hasn't pleased those banks and banks of Danish fans, clad in red behind Izzy, where she is behind the goal that Jordan Pickford has been into that first 45 minutes. But despite all of that, it's Denmark wanting them, wanting them to have four points at the end of today if the score stays as is. But England have had fewer shots and less possessions than the Danes at the end of that first half. 5-2-6 in the UK, 5-7 here in Germany. Nick Hatfield has a news update. The Voice of the UK. And the Home of the Euros and the General Election 2024. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Good evening. The BBC has learned that the party's director of campaigning for the Conservatives, Tony Lee, is being looked into by the Gambling Commission about alleged bets on the date of the election. He's married to Laura Saunders, a Conservative candidate who is also the subject of inquiries by the betting industry regulator. Our correspondent, Gary O'Donoughy reports. It is not known when the alleged bet involving Tony Lee and Laura Saunders was placed or how much it was for. A third Conservative, Craig Williams, who was Rishi Sunak's Parliamentary Private Secretary, is also being looked into after he placed a £100 bet, an action he himself apologised for and described as a huge error of judgement. Opposition figures have unsurprisingly pounced with the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, calling on the Prime Minister to suspend Laura Saunders, saying if it were one of my candidates, their feet wouldn't have touched the ground. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davy described the allegations as quite awful and called for a Cabinet Office investigation. The Post Office has apologised for publishing the names of the addresses of 555 postmasters prosecuted during the Horizon IT scandal. The company confirmed personal details were shared in a document on its website, and it has referred itself to the Information Commissioner's office. And the Bank of England has held interest rates at 5.25% for the seventh time in a row. The bank's Governor, Andrew Bailey, says it's good news inflation has returned to their target of 2%, but they want to make sure price rises stay low. The news, Ellie Brennan, has the travel. In the latest travel news, the M42 northbound, you've got stop-start traffic between Junction 3A, the M40 interchanged, and Junction 4. There was a broken down car there earlier. Looking very slow, though, back to Renich at Junction 3, and on the M40 northbound as you approach the M42, that's very heavily congested. The M1 southbound, two lanes are closed between Junction 14 and Milton Keynes and 13. Emergency barrier repairs, they're really slow traffic going through. And in S6A12, northbound is closed. Between Junction 16 and 17, there's been an accident there. Cue in traffic on the approach to that. Ellie Brennan, 5-Life Travel. This is going to have all the festival chat, all the action, all the backstage gossip. Side tracks by Glastonbury. Listen first on BBC Sounds. Euro 2024, Deutschland. With Mark Chapman. On 5-Life and BBC Sounds. Denmark won, England won at the break in the other game in that group. Earlier on that also finished one all between Slovenia and Serbia. We have Italy, Spain still to come this evening. We'll go to our commentary team at that one shortly. And India or Afghanistan in the men's T20 World Cup, Fraser Mohamed. Well, interestingly enough, it's India in control. 35 for three are Afghanistan after six overs. Struggling in pursuit of that Indian total, 181 for eight. Suriya Kumar Yadav with 53. Three wickets for Rashid Khan, three for Fazal Hakka, for Ruki. But Afghanistan dependent on their middle order. They're struggling. 35 for three after six overs. And then the next ball is extra if you want to listen to that big win at Queens today for the new British number one, Jack Draper. He defeated defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Kiprios narrowly beat Trollerman in the gold cup at Royal Ascot. And after winning Olympic cycling gold in both Rio and Tokyo, Katie Archibald will not be in Paris. She fell yesterday in her garden and she no need surgery because she broke her ankle, her fibula, in that accident. Second half on the way from here in Frankfurt and then we'll be in Gelsen Kierken for Italy against Spain. Our commentary team of Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton are already there. How do you view this one, Ian? Looking forward to it, Mark. I think Spain, after the opening set of matches, along with Germany, we're one of the most impressive of the teams that we saw. So can they build on that against the defending champions? Obviously it's a tough group and they both know after their opening victories that another three points today will see them into the knockout stages. So I think it's going to be a really entertaining game. They both had their tough moments, didn't they, Chris, in their opening games? I mean, Spain didn't have it all their own way against Croatia and Italy fell behind to Albania. Yeah, I think there's still room for improvement but winning the opening games in tournament football is of such great importance. I mean, this is going to be fascinating though because I think going into the Euros, I don't think many people fancied Spain or Italy to win it but I still think they both showed enough in their opening games to know that they can improve and that Ian's quite rightly touched on the importance of winning this game to go through to the knockouts. That's massive. But it wouldn't surprise me if we saw Spain or Italy actually winning the Euros. They both teams have great quality and interesting managers. What do you mean by interesting managers? Well, I mean, they're similar positions but I think they're both teams in transition. De La Fuente in truth, I hadn't heard a lot about him. I know that he took the Spanish junior teams and had great success there so getting the full Spanish job, that's a great faith from the Spanish FA but they looked pretty handy against Croatia and Spalletti. I think did James Horncastle not say that he's the best manager in the tournament. We know he likes to play front football all about performance. He was disappointed. He came out and said he was disappointed with the performance in the first game. Albeit, we saw Albania and they ran Italy close and we saw what they did to Croatia yesterday. This is the group of death. I thought this was always going to be the Titus group but tonight is going to be enormous in terms of whoever wins is already through. Whoever loses though. You wouldn't have expected Croatia to be on one point after two games though, would you? Well, I wrote them off at the start of the tournament. I would have done. Speaking of your predictions, can I just say what a joy it was to read your prediction for the France-Nedalins game that's coming up tomorrow on the BBC Sport website. I wouldn't normally point people in the direction of your predictions but if you've got 30 seconds a minute to read Chris's view, Dr Chris's view on Kylian Mbappe's broken nose and how that might affect the French, it is well worth reading on the BBC Sport website. Can I also just quickly say, Mark, can I also say that isn't a great read but you're lucky we're here tonight because we couldn't get out of the hotel car park. Why Rob and Ian Dennis couldn't get out for 15-20 minutes. It's Rob's first tournament, you can't throw away those barriers. Honestly, I've videoed it all on my Maype Dons socials. Can you know what though, Mark? I said to Chris, I said, we'll meet in the garage, the car park at five o'clock. He was wasting in reception. Me and Rob are on time in the right place, right? It's always a vicious fault. This is now called a deflection technique. It's a great watch, I'll send it to you later. OK, could be a long night listening to his silly spade on Five Life but they are... Tomorrow's the longest day. Yes, very good. Tonight's the longest night. It is in Gelsenkirk and we will be with those two a little bit later on. England and Denmark both back out and there are no changes, John Murray. For either side, but you did wonder whether there might be tweaks for England. You did, and I can tell you it's a very tight car park that we've got in Essen. So I'm with Ian and Rob. Right, Denmark were out for the start of the second half as they looked like they couldn't wait to get going. No changes. England were late out of the dressing room or longer out of the dressing room as though they were a little bit trepidatious about what might lie ahead. So the teams are the same. Schmeichel and Gull for Denmark, Joachim Andersen, Andreas Christensen, Janak Vestigard, there's the whistle for the start of the second half. Mailer on the right had so much space and time. Mailer, Victor Christensen on the left who was caught out for the England opening goal. Hulnand and Hoibjeer in the middle and then as Conor Cody's been describing, Ericsson and Vint with Hoiland in a sort of spearhead as an offside flag goes up against the Danes. And England, we did wonder whether Garis Southgate might do something. Pickford in goal, Walker Stones, Gay in trippier, Alexander-Arnold and Rice, Saka Bellingham-Fordon and Harry Kane, the England goal scorer through the middle. We thought, would he bring perhaps Gallagher, Menu, but he's sticking with Trent Alexander-Arnold. They're back out after half time, very similar shape, similar personnel. Rice, a little bit more central, Alexander-Arnold and Joop Bellingham. Interesting how they get to grips with that so important middle of the pitch in this second half. It really is going to be key to the outcome. Second group match this, Denmark-1, England-1, but this feels like a massive half for England that lies ahead here. They are top of the group with three points, Slovenia-1 on two, Denmark and Serbia on one. But Denmark have dominated this since England took the lead strangely. And here they come again on the right-hand side. Mailer's ball into the penalty area, still Denmark left-foot shot, that's deflected across the goal, Highlands after it, Stones heads it away, and England have just about dealt with, in fact, been kicked up in the air by Trippier and caught by Pickford. That does not bring confidence to all of the England fans around this stadium. Well, Vint picks up an unbelievable position to get on the ball. Alexander-Arnold is very fortunate, I think, to get a foul from the referee, Hoibier. I thought he'd given it away. I don't think he had too much of a picture when he received the ball from Pickford on his back foot. There's not really much of an idea about where that ball was going and nearly got robbed. I'm not even sure if that was a foul, John, to be honest, but the chance before, it was Vint who just peeled off into that area, whether it's Ericsson. You know that Hoibier is going to be the one stretching, but Vint is a problem. He just keeps picking up lovely little positions, making himself available, and they're just feeding the ball into him, and then he can get his head up and play. Matt Upps and England World Cup player Conor Cody is up here as well, who's been in Gareth Southgate's last two squads at the Euros in the World Cup, and Declan Rice is surrounded by red Danish shirts and loses possession, and the Danes have got it again. And I must say, we talked in the first half, at the end of the first half, about how important it was for Gareth Southgate to get them in and regroup. The opening moments of the second half are not promising for England, although Gaine steps forward, and now Kane, under pressure from Andreas Christensen, is able to find Saka on the right-hand side. Ball fortunately deflects to Walker, could have gone anywhere. Back to Kane, England approaching the edge of the penalty area. Here is Saka, little ball to Harry Kane on the right-hand side. Kane, who scored his 64th England goal in the first half. Then back to the halfway line, and England go back into the centre circle. They're attacking now towards the stand that is absolutely packed. It's splashed with red, and a little bit of white in there as well. The Denmark end, 16,000 supporters. John Stones now to Kyle Walker. Then back centrally to Trent Alexander-Arnold. Rice has a look over his shoulder, gives it back to the Liverpool man, he's given it away, misplaced pass that John Stones is able to come across, and just sends a pass out to the left-hand side. She has from Denmark because that was going nowhere. That just landed the ball in no man's land, and Denmark were able to take possession. And England are here in Frankfurt. They look as though they're on the verge of a crisis. Just disjointed, isn't it? Not coming together at all in terms of being fluid in or out of possession. Header forward, Andreas Christensen wins it against Bellingham. Bellingham in on the challenge to win it back. Christian Erikson's in there as well. And then up to Hojland, Vint, first-time pass is actually behind Victor Christensen, who with Bellingham still taking time to get up, looks at the referee, and walks away, clearly feels that he should have been given a free kick, which he wasn't. So Denmark will come for it again. Mela, and then Mela back into his own half. Mela the Wolfsdurg man who came in, that was the only change that Casper Hulman, the likable coach of Denmark. This is his third tournament, Carousel gets fourth. Casper Hulman just making that one change today. Denmark with it in the centre-circle. 1-1 in the earlier match in this group. Long and forward towards Hojland, who chests it off, played forward by Christian Erikson, and then Gage is able to clear the fold and jumping forward, just heads it back to Denmark, and then in goes Reiss to try and win it back. Awkward bouncing ball for Bellingham, and then Alexander-Arnold sets off from inside his own half with a run, passes the ball behind Foden, he had Kane, Foden and Sacher ahead of him. That was a welcome sight for England to see Alexander-Arnold taking charge of the situation, and England pouring forward. It's been far too little of that from the team. Walker, now to Sacher on the right-hand side, Sacher up against Victor Christensen, looking to take him on. Victor Christensen, backpedalite, then the cross to the back post, taken down by Foden, who stabs it, it's actually cleared away, just touched away by Neyla, but England now are actually taking a bit of initiative here. Trivia into the penalty area, Bellingham strides after it, languidly, this tall 20-year-old, keeping possession, then giving it back to Kieran Trivia on the left-hand side. Trivia back to Reiss, thinks about a shot, does have a low shot, which is deflected, but I think it took a bit of the pace off it, it was spinning, but Schmeichel could just drop to his left and hold it. There was one or two little nicks on the way through this ball, I think a lot of the pace was taken right off it from Hoiland, who does a good job getting back to Schmeichel, Reiss down, and it just skips on through to Kaspersh-Meichel, who just gathers it up rather easily. There's got to be a nervous watch for England supporters. One-one the score, but Denmark have given more than as good as they've got from England in this match, very disjointed from the England team, there must be substitutions on the way, you would think. That's a poor pass forward though from Sennethield, from the Danish goal scorer, Hoiland, that just gives possession back to England. The roof is closed, we've got this canopy-style roof to this stadium, which is out to the south of the city, just under 50,000 people inside, and actually there's a big gap between the top of the stands and that roof, so the sun is shining in it, streaked across the pitch. As England with John Stones just wander forward with the ball, Stones then in field to Alexander-Arnold, White shirt just bobbing outside his blue shorts, Trippier, 50th cap for Kieran Trippier, the Newcastle United man. Alexander-Arnold goes for a long high pass, Sacher into the penalty area tries to pull it down, but then as Schmeichel comes out, the defenders in there as well, Sacher actually just knotted forward through for a goal kick. England are going to make a change, and it is Conagallagher. Yeah, as you called John, to be honest, got a spot on, and I think Conagallagher, obviously the player coming on to affect the game when England were suffering a little bit against Serbia, who's the man who's just taken his jumper off and is getting some instruction in the technical area. Let's bring in Conagallagher, Conacordi as well. It had to come. Say what, John, if you do some job, if he was up here and down there... That would be more than box-to-box. Box-to-commentary box with Schmielder. No, I think it's a good call. We mentioned it half-time, didn't we, about the legs that Conor will give, and it'll come in. And there'll be a little bit of agency. I think that's the biggest thing at this moment in time. There's a real lack of agency with England, I don't know if it's tired legs or a little bit of fadgy, but we just need a little bit of agency in there. Yeah, I think Conagallagher is waiting to come on as Miele hits the pass forward, that Gazehead will head it down, Ericsson on the stretch, then in field, it'll glance him, head a forward Schumann, Hulmann, but Hulmann was coming back from an offside position. And actually, again, the referee could have allowed play to continue there with England on the attack, but he's actually stopped play so that the change can be made, and it is Trent Alexander-Arnold who will be replaced by Conagallagher, who, as in the match against Serbia, comes on as a substitute, the Chelsea man. Yeah, I think it was interesting we were talking before about being not in the start of 11 and having an impact and kind of playing or earning your way into the team. It's a great opportunity for Conagallagher to come on and have a positive impact with his energy. Con has just spoken about needing that in the middle of the park. Well, that's what he brings. He'll run all day, and he'll just get after the ball, any loose balls, anything that drops down, applying pressure. So a big opportunity for him in this game, which is looking like it is slightly slipping away from England. It does have that feel. So Conagallagher coming on in the 54th minute, and Trent Alexander-Arnold is off. And England in possession of the ball, playing it back to Pickford, controls it, and then left-footed to the halfway line. Andres Christensen with the challenge, but Kane saw him coming. It was the England captain who got his head to the ball, and now Bellingham gets the ball down and is off on a run and passes it to Foden, slightly behind Phil Foden, back into the area. Again, Bellingham's low ball across the penalty area, but that is whacked away by Hulman, landed on his feet, and he gave it what for and put it out for a throw. Conagallagher turns away, because I think he's thought about making the run across the park exactly where that ball came in for Bellingham, but he decided to hold the edge of the box, and it was cleared easily, but any kind of run across the face would have been an opportunity. And actually Denmark are going to make a double change just shortly. I see Michael Damsegaard is going to come on. Remember, he scored the free kick against England at Wembley in the semifinal three years ago, so he's coming on, and also Alexander Barr, so I guess he'll be coming on for Mellor on the right-hand side. So a double change coming for Denmark. Here is Conagallagher, long blonde-haired tie-back. Now to Saka on the right-hand side, Saka taking on Victor Christensen, and then playing it in field of Foden on his left foot, shoots low, and it's the post! It comes out to Saka, but Saka was under pressure from Victor Christensen, who, no, his final touch was off, Saka, it is a goal kick, but England now hit the post. Yeah, bit of snap in the play in his second half. Saka doing his thing, luring the defenders in, sees the open space to slide the ball in field to Foden, who's come all the way across, one touch to control, another one to get out of his feet, and he drives it towards the near post, really low along the ground, and it's ricochets off the upright, straight back out into play. England midfield at Izzy Christensen's down behind that goal. Yeah, it's a brilliant bit of play from Saka, isn't it? Cuts inside and he finds Foden, and it's a daisy cutter across the surface of the grass by Foden, it fizzes away from the post. Kasper Schermakl is actually really lucky, it doesn't come back off the post and hits him and ricochet into his own net, but there's a bit of an angle on the ball, but brilliant from Foden, and that's more like it from him. It will change, it's Vint and Victor Christensen who have come off. So the Brentford man, Mikael Damsegaard, coming on into the midfield, a forward-thinking player, and then Alexander Bar, who started the first match for Denmark against Slovenia. Alexander Bar has come on to play on the right-hand side. Yeah, he switched with Mairla's gone up there to the far side. So the double change from Kasper Schermakl. The score remains 1-1, the ball out of play for a throw-in to England. So 1-1, it's on BBC One as well, the Euros all across the BBC, all the platforms, the match commentaries at the heart of what we do, where you can rewind the live radio, not necessarily sure this is one that you will want to listen back to, but we'll see. But all the podcasts are on there as well, the football daily. You'll never beat Kyle Walker. That's going to tempt fate, but that's all on there. Denmark, one England, one. And you can listen to the five-life commentary, by the way, with the BBC TV pictures, if you go to the iPlayer BBC Sport website, and app, it's all synced up. 1-1 with Denmark playing the ball forward down the right-hand side. This is for the newly arrived Damsegaard, who gets the ball into the penalty area. It bounces almost to Christian Eriksson, and Conor Gallagher just got there in the nick of time inside the area to prevent it from doing so. It's out for a throw. That's a crucial touch. Hoiland does brilliantly. The ball gets looped over. He doesn't try and do anything. He just gets his body across and just chests it into the space. He knows that a midfield player could be arriving. Throw-in from Barthes, a long one into the penalty area, headed down and then cleared away by Saka on the edge of the box. There's Joachim Andersen, who's put under pressure, and Harry Kane now. Harry Kane goes for a curling pass, and what a lovely pass that is. Beautifully waited for Saka, Saka now near the edge of the box. Two Danish players with him. Saka then turns and shoots across the face of goal, but wide at the far post, but Harry Kane started that. Better. I don't mind that kind of positivity. Kane coming inside has that confidence and belief to play. The kind of passes that we know he can, and Saka then, they ended up doubling up in that situation. Denmark got another player back in there, so we couldn't quite get the scoring or shooting opportunity wanted, but it's just much better. It's a bit slicker to play quicker. Haven't seen enough of that from England tonight. Better in the second half? Marginally. Yeah, I'll tell you, the way we finished, or certainly the 15 or 10 minutes after we scored in the first half, was really poor. We just didn't get a hold of it at all. One-one. After Harry Kane shot England in front, Saka had a little touch as well in the build-up to the Kane goal. Gay, heads it on the half-way line, and then a super equaliser from Morton Hulman. Excellent shot from between 25 and 30 yards out. England now with Foden. Foden looks up. He's looking for Saka. Leoparded ball right across there, so they ask no top scorer this season. Takes on Mailer. Beats him. Saka then to the byline pulls that across, but that's intercepted by Andreas Christensen. And Denmark are able to get it away. England looking for Saka. John Stones passes it all the way back to Pickford, controls it on his thigh, and then passes it back to the Manchester City man, John Stones, winning his 74th cap tonight. And then Walker tried to pass it to Stones, passed it straight to Denmark, and then conceded a free kick on the left. He's frustrated with that car, Walker. He just couldn't quite find the pass. He was a little bit boxed in. He wanted to play inside, but he realised if that pass inside is not the right pass, he puts England bang in trouble, so he holds onto it too long, and then it gives a far away when Hoiberg makes quite a clean tackle, and it's a wide free kick in a dangerous area. What happened to Walker there is very typical of what's been happening in this match. It's not right for England. It's not the same amount of options are there. When the Dines get the ball, they appear to have the option. Danger here, an Ericsson free kick out on the left-hand side. Ericsson plays it in, but it hits Mark Gage, who's 10 yards away from the ball, and he did well to keep his feet there, Sucker. He was reeling. He rocked him a bit. Once, Muhammad Ali fought right here on this patch of land back in the 60s, and that was redolent of what might have been happening that day, as England win a free kick for a foul by Gallagher, who is yellow carded. So just minutes after coming on, there's a yellow card for Conor Gallagher. Yeah, just a little bit late, trying to put some energy, inject a bit of that into the midfield, and get off to the ball. He doesn't make it. I'm not too sure why he's given a yellow card. I think that's a little bit harsh. He gets his slight toe, maybe just stands on the top of the foot, but it wasn't a particularly vicious challenge. I'll, when we bring in Conor Cody next, maybe Conor give us an idea of who you might want to see Garrah Southgate call on next from off the substitute bench. But Denmark have this free kick, match poised at 1-1, and we have commentary next on one of the big games of the group stage, Spain, Italy, which will come to you live from Gelsenkirchen inside the Schalke Stadium, Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton from 8 o'clock, and the Castleford Hole KR Super League match will be on Sports Extra tonight. So a choice of listening there. England's cricket is played tomorrow afternoon, by the way. That's on Sports Extra. England against South Africa live from Lusha at the T20, which is on right now, Afghanistan, India. Denmark won England 1 here at the Euros in England's second group match. England, for most of this match, up against it, uninspiring. And Denmark, much brighter. You've got Hoiberg, who started just 10 matches for Tottenham this season. Christian Eriksen just 14 starts for Manchester United. They do look fresh, I have to say, as the ball is played out to the right-hand side by Damsegaard. And then Bar back into Damsegaard inside the penalty area. The Brentford man looking to turn, but Reis came in with a challenge. Kieran Trippier down there, passes it forward to Phil Forden. England, pinned in there, left-back position, played forward. Dellingham just got a header to that. Denmark are onto it. Conagalla comes forward, he heads it on, comes back to Reis. Reis in danger of losing out. Christian Eriksen onto this, but the left-foot shot flies away. High over the top of Jordan Picklitz, crossbar. But again, England just look uncertain. Caught on the ball, losing possession. It's been a bit of a game of not being settled enough with the ball. We always seem to be chasing the first touch, or the first touch is under pressure, which, credit to Denmark, they're pressurising really well, but it's not enabling us to really have good possession or be able to get on the ball and make our passes. Reis, Harry Kane, Forden, Bellingham, they've not had the time to really get on the ball, have a good first touch, be comfortable and find a good option. It's just harassed all the time, which credit to Denmark for that. Well, it's still all-square, but I think whatever happens here tonight, whether England win, lose or draw, there will be another torrent of criticism for the way that England have played. Here is Walker on the right-hand side, Saka, then Bellingham, looking strangely tentative. Then back to Pickford on the edge of the penalty area, and the Everton goalkeeper passes it out to Gay, and then, for it, Harry Kane drops into his own half, and the Anik Vestergaard goes with him, Vestergaard, who has been yellow-carded, but not been put under pressure at all. Now Kyle Walker carries the ball downfield, Bellingham. That's that change of feet again from Jude Bellingham. He just runs into the challenge and loses out to Damsegaard, who passes it forward, Mark Gay, Gamble there, it was the right decision. He won possession back, then he couldn't hit the pass forward. It was Kuhlman, who stepped into it, and then Inkoz Gay again. The England fans applauding Mark Gay's effort there. Walker, now Saka, Saka, up against Mailak. Mailak steps off, Saka with the cross, right across the penalty area. A applause from Phil Forden for the idea from Pukajosaka, but over-hit through Goldkick. I'm not sure we've really felt that threatening when the ball's wideened, we're going to score a goal. He'd been a good cross in positions, but it's not really looking like we're going to get the ball into the box, and somebody's arriving to get on the end of it. Right, well, I didn't get the chance to say to Konakori, because the changes are coming, and there's going to be three of them. I was going to say, Damsegaard, to be fair, I just had the idea that you might. Watkins, Bowen and Ezzar, 1920 and 21. So, a barragey, Ezzar going to come into the tournament for the first time, his first taste of tournament action. Bowen, who came on as the substitute the other night, and then Oli Watkins also, first chance to show what he can do on this stage, the big stage where England really tonight have very often fluffed their lines. And this will be very interesting to see who's coming off, as John Stones is put under pressure by Highland, and an unforced error passes it out of play, he's trying to give it the game, and that's a corner to Denmark, the cheapest of cheap corners. Yeah, Declan Rice looking really frustrated, it came into him, and again, there's no comfortable first touch, there's no comfortable situation on the ball, there's pressure all the time, and it's really testing the first touch, yes, the pitch isn't great, I think the ball is bobbling in a little bit, but you can't make excuses in that sense, it's the same for both teams, and Denmark have been better with their passing, more accurate and more fluent. Actually, Denmark are going to make the change first, and it's the experienced Yusuf Paulsen, who's coming on to win his 82nd cap, and Manchester United has to rest the Toilanders off, because he has made a nuisance of himself. It's a big surprise, physically he's been a real handful, but Paulsen is a big lad, I think they're looking to maybe get the ball in the box and get crosses in. Yeah, RB Leipzig forward, so it's a corner, England aren't making the changes yet, 1-1, Ericsson with the deep corner, that bounces right to the edge of the penalty area, still in the England box, comes out to the edge of the box, and then the shot that Pickford is able to control, just above his head, he just parried it up in the air, and then on the follow-up, was able to gather the ball after the shot, I think it was Andreas Christensen, actually, who hit them, comes back to Pickford, and then to Trippie out on his right foot, chips it forward to Foulden, and then up to Kane, Denmark are in on the challenge on Harry Kane, strong and forward from Vestegard, Heubje goes down after a challenge, Denmark, play continues, the ball is chipped out towards the left-hand side, Mailer is there but he can't reach that, it's a throw into England in the right back area. And there's a classic example there about how we just haven't handled the ball well enough, in terms of sharpness, first touch, it just seems a little bit loose, John, almost like we're chasing a bad touch all the time. No where near, is it? No. Right, here come at least the first couple of the changes, and it is Phil Foulden who's going to be replaced by a Baruchie Ezzar. So on comes England's Crystal Palace man, who finished the season in such fine form, and off comes the Premier League player of the season, and Bukai Osaka as well, is the straight swap there for Jared Bohm on the right, you were kind of expecting this, Matt, and it is Harry Kane who's off, so the England captain substituted, and only Watkins comes on, that's a big call. You don't see that very often. You do not. In games where England need a goal, it's tight, it's 1-1, you don't normally see Harry Kane come off the pitch, but I think such as how the game's gone, just that injection of fresh legs and energy, and whatever else that brings is what Garis Southgate really feels this game needs to maybe tip it in England's way. Garis Southgate walks across, applauding Harry Kane, who comes off the field. Remember how he missed football at the end of the season, the back issue that he had, that they told us was absolutely fine, but even so, Conakordi, to see Harry Kane being substituted at a match at the Euros that's 1-1 with 20 minutes to play. Yeah, it's a really bold move, but I do like the idea of giving people who've had great seasons a lot of trust in this England team. Oli Watkins has been fantastic this year, and he fully deserves his place on his pitch at the minute, so I'm all for giving people him opportunities, because he's been brilliant all year. The Aston Villa top scorer, the 27-goal top scorer, Oli Watkins, what an opportunity this is now, in England changing the front three here. Saka, Kane and Foden are off, and it is Bun, Watkins and Ezzat who are on. About two months ago, we weren't expecting that, were we? No, but I think it's a big moment in the game for England. Maybe it can just spark a little bit more in this last 20 minutes or so. Still a big stage of this game left to play. The thing is, England have got to get the ball to them, and that's been an issue. As Trippier hits a right footer pass, that's nowhere near Watkins, and Denmark, that's the guards, able to take that down and just pass it in field to his central defensive partner, but Walker's onto this at pace, gets there ahead of Meila. Walker near the right corner of the box, he's actually been forced away wide, Bourne's got to involve for the first time, Jared Bourne wins the throw-in, Walker takes it, Gallagher turning the full 360 degrees, back to Walker who goes back to the halfway line. 20 minutes to go here. Spain, Italy on the way, live from Gelsenkirchen, but a massive 20 minutes for Garis Southgate's England. It is 1-1, if you're listening to the tenor of what we're seeing, you'll be thinking, you know, hang on, what's going on? But this is nowhere near the performance that Garis Southgate and England were looking for. Here's Ezzer, deep-lying position. England will want him to run at me, depending on him through. Watkins for the chance from the angle, but Schmeichel comes out sliding, a blocker behind, it's a corner, that's more like it. Yeah, just a little sample of those really busy runs that Oli Watkins made, he bends it nicely, he is onside, he thought it was going to be given offside, but he gets there, Schmeichel comes out well, the angle's tight. But that's classic Oli Watkins, lovely run, just bent round into the corner of the box, a lovely pass from Bellingham, I think it was. Yes, it was. Jared Bourne, 10th cap tonight, he's going to take the corner from the right-hand side. England's first corner of the match. Bourne, into the near post, comes off a Denmark head, comes out to Tribya, Tribya nods it square to Gallagher. Gallagher rather awkwardly, he's always given it away, he couldn't find it as a Denmark could break forward. Christian Erikson's the man who's furthest forward, but Gallagher's able to come back and prevent his forward motion. But then taken on by Paul Sinner, back him from him, Bourne slips over, Christian Erikson tries to play it into the penalty area, blocked by Gallagher, who's certainly showing that energy that England need, but chasing shadows here, because Denmark again, with Christian Erikson, what a story this is, after what happened three years ago, Erikson right at the heart of things for Denmark. And they go back, Casper Hulmans side, back to the halfway line. They're certainly winning this on points, talking about boxing. Here again, Nela having switched flanks. Vestergaard, a little flick by Christian Erikson. Then the shot from distance, the pick-foot goes down, pushes it away, the shot from Hoipiam, saved by the Everton goalkeeper. And then a foul, and a yellow card, Nela. Just dived in rather on Jared Bourne, who gets the free kick, and a yellow card for Mela for that, 1-1. The flick from Erikson, the tiny little touch he put in there, was just exquisite, just enough to just flick it round the corner into the path of his teammate, who gets the shot off, pick-foot parries to the right-hand side. And as per the whole game, Mela goes in for the tackle, and a big chunk of turf flies up in the air, and onto the ground. I think Bowen stopped awkwardly just before that, and felt his ankle afterwards. He just put the break, and I think this is mainly happening when people are putting the brakes on, John. It's just collapsing underneath their feet. Yeah, the pitch has been nowhere near what you would want for a match of this calibre after all of the rain. So soft, oh, the ball has won back by Watkins near the edge of the penalty area challenge comes in. Schmeichel's going to do well to reach that, no, he can't, Sprint, Nuit, Wieslef, and Oli Watkins has looked sharp, and Oli Watkins, and Bellingham as well, just turning Bellingham to the England fans in the stands, and wailing his arms and saying, come on, because Denmark, they've been the noisiest. I don't think there's any doubt about that, because that's what's reflected what's been happening on the field. Corner, then, Bowen to take this. Jared Bowen places it down in the quadrant. And Barra Ciaz, he goes over there as an option, but I think he will swing it in to the near post. Here it is, and it's headed away by Hoipier, and will bounce out of play near the halfway line for an England throw-in. As that, he's still over there on that far side, actually just leaves it to Kyle Walker, and Walker takes a quick throw down the line to Jared Bowen. Bowen, then, and this plays as a pass out of play. I did wonder whether he'd taken it flat. And Walker, Walker was just holding onto the ball, and the Danish fans are saying, hang on, what about a yellow card for Kyle Walker, but referee Suarez Diaz has been kind again to England. Yeah, whether or not it was long enough for a yellow card, the referee didn't feel so. I mean, he did jog away with the ball as opposed to just releasing it. It was a big cry from those Danish fans all sat over the far side of the stand. Do you remember Qatar, the second match there, the nil-nil with the United States? Yes, I do. And do you remember the last Euros, the second match there, the nil-nil with Scotland? Yes. Was it better than this one from England's performance? Stamptons? I would say on a par. Yeah. And there was a reaction to that, as there will be a reaction to this, because England have not played very well. That's a simple matter. I think you can't be at your best all the time, and you've got to, if it's not a good day, you make the best of a bad day, don't you? And as long as England see this through to a point and get through to the third group stage game with four points, it's not a bad return, John. That's well played by Bourn Noyes, actually committed the foul on Vestigard on the halfway line, so it's a free-pick to Denmark. Just to the left of the centre circle. The third match in the group. Remember if England were able to turn this round and snatch a winner, that would be then through as group winners. But that is not looking the most likely outcome here. The third match is on Tuesday, and that's a night match. That's a late match as well. 8 o'clock UK time against Slovenia. I thought it looked quite dangerous to get to Serbia today. Denmark won, England won. Denmark again on the front foot. Ericsson back to Hoibje, who's going to have a goal from distance through a crowd of players that Jordan Pickford was able to deal with that and give it out to Kyle Walker, and then urges him, sends him on his way, short past to Gallagher. Gallagher couldn't find the ball back to Walker. He's got a great start again, and the thousands and thousands of Danish fans wall their team on again. It's one of their national characteristics, isn't it? Roaring. And here, the ball on the halfway line with Denmark. Now, back to the right-hand side, to Joachim Andersen. We are into the last 15 minutes now. Garaslavke stalks and walks around for other anxious-looking gay against Paulson. The two of them tangling, the ball runs away for what he's given as a goal kick. Paulson can't believe it. He's making a gesture to the referee. There was a hefty pullback from Mark Gehrie. I think Gehrie's trying to see the ball out of play. Paulson kind of nudges him out of the way, and then there's almost a bit of a headlock moment going on. I don't think there's a foul there. I think Paulson goes down really easily. It is a bit scrappy. I think Pickford's looking at the situation, and I'm just going to go long here at the moment. I'm not going to tickle the ball short. We haven't been good enough with the ball, certainly in our defensive third to risk playing out at the moment. But if he does go long, what happens is exactly what did happen. He turned the ball over, gets headed back to Kasper Schmeichel, and then Denmark starts to build again from the back. Conakory is here with us, the Leicester City in England. The interesting thing here, Conak, when we get a chance, is Denmark play, going forward towards Pickford, who's going to deal with that easily. You know what the tournament mindset and thought will be right now inside the England camp with Gareth Southgate after a match in a performance like this. But just hang on, because England with Gallagher, give it to Walker. Walker then turns and back it goes to John Stones, just over 10 minutes to go here in Frankfurt with the sun shining. John Stones, ball at his feet, dappled sunshine, moves through it to his left, gives it to Gea, and then the Beretschiazis not had a chance to run and then passes the ball forward. Oli Watkins chases after it, not sure he'll catch up with it. No, he reached it just as it got to the white line, put his foot on it and it rolled over. So, coming Conakory. Yeah, I think a big thing for me, John, is... Listen, I think we can all see here that England haven't been at the best, I think England haven't played great. I think Denmark have been better. I think a big one, even though you want to win these games, I think it's important, you don't lose this now, I think 12 minutes to go. I think the mentality is, you can go and win it with the players who have given them a little bit of life, I'll be honest. I think Oli Watkins running behind, Ines A and Bowen running behind, I think they've given a bit of life, but I think it's important now they do not lose this game in the next 12, 15 minutes. Yeah, and we talked, Matt, you and I, on air and off air, about England growing into the tournament. Actually, they've gone in the other direction in this match. Yeah, I'd agree with that. Well, if the result stays like this, that would be the case, and the performance probably... Definitely with the ball, it's really surprising. We haven't managed to really be confident and control it at all. As I caught in possession by Hoibje, he's fortunate. Fortunate there. The referee has been a came claim to England, Hoibje. Paulson, who felt he should have had a free kick a few moments earlier against Gage. He's the assistant that flagged as well, but I think Hoibje is close enough to the ball to warrant that kind of contact. The ball is identical distance between him and Eze. He has a right to use his body there and try and manoeuvre him out of the way, and he does that well. Denmark won, England won. commentary to come from 8 o'clock, UK time. Spain against this, and he don't miss that. Gage with a pass forward over the half-way line, looking for Eze. England want to try and get him running at the Denmark defence, but it's Denmark in possession. Back it goes towards the half-way line, the quite long-haired Joachim Andersen talking about all the Crystal Palace men in the England team. Here's one in the Danish side-up, and so you've got Eze up against his team-mate Joachim Andersen who turns, sees Eze in front of him, and then very quickly passes it back to the goalkeeper. It's not quite got the Griezmann-George-Michael-Lotz, is it? No, he's having a go. Griezmann's unmatched. No. As the ball bounces out for a throw on the far side for England. That was a little sloppy by Denmark. Excellent performance from Denmark. Massive improvement from them on their first match. Should be said against Slovenia, and Kastri Hulman's going to make another couple of changes. I see Andreas Skol Olsson's coming on, the Bruges player. He's a winger, and also, I think that's Christian Norgaard, isn't it? A Brenford, he answers, coming on. So another of the Brenford men, Thomas Frank, their manager, part of our coverage. Jon Stoens goes to a long pass from the half-way line. That's headed down and away by Joachim Andersen. That's given away by Hulman to Jude Bellingham, who's been very quiet in the second half. Bourne tries to slip in Watkins on the edge of the area. That's turned away by Christensen out for the far side, and it's a throw in to England down there. It always has a positive touch, Jared Bourne. Wherever he goes, he likes to take the ball with him, or he steps in so well. Very nearly finds Olly Watkins. You just can't take the ball with him when he slides the ball forward, coming inside off the line. And it's the goal scorer. England substituted their goal scorer, the captain Harry Kane. Denmark are taking theirs off. Morton Hulman and Christian Erikson are also walking towards this side of the field. Yeah, that's it. That's going to be the end of his afternoon. He's equaled Simon Kers' record here. Christian Erikson is now the joint most-capped player for Denmark at the age of 32, his 132nd cap. He's been excellent. Oh, he's been brilliant. Really good. I mean, he's just controlled so many matters of the game. He's pulling strings, he's finding space. You know, they always say about top players, but he looks so relaxed and comfortable in this place. He never looks rushed at all. His first touch, he really looks like... He's come back to the Euros, where those awful events happened three years ago with a real determination to put that absolutely in the past. 1-1, five-life, BBC sounds. It's on BBC One as well, if you're nearly home. And Denmark, after the England throw, they lose possession. England, Denmark with a little flick in field, but that gives it back to Rice. That's a little short from Guy, and he's lost it, and now it's taken for it by Bar into the England area. And then Eklund recovery from Mark Guy to put in the challenge, because Bar was in two minds there, whether they should or whether they sent it, and Guy took advantage of that, and put in the top. He did. He tried to kind of... It was a difficult ball back to him, he didn't have a lot of option. Tried to win it, but then you can only gauge a mistake by the reaction, his reaction is absolutely spot-on. Gets his head down, pumps his arms, works his way back in to the penalty box and gets a really important blocking. But I think the pitch might have done us a little favour there as well. It was just bobbling up, and I don't think Bar was too happy with it. Score awesome with the corner into the near post. Oh, the chance, and that scooped over the bar. And actually, it was falling there, and I think possibly slipping as well as he went for goal. Is it Christensen? It was Andreas Christensen, and he scooped it over from six yards out. I say scooped it over, he skied it. Yeah, well, she'd scored, really. Just can't step in. It's a difficult one if your body weight's not forward and you're leaning back, which he was, is why the ball went so high, but Paulson really made himself a hamster. England have lost it again, Denmark take it on towards the edge of the penalty area. Gallagher's in there, right for Chopped, calling all narrowly wide of the top corner. Flashers pass, Jordan Pickford's left post. Goodness me. And England there, again losing possession. So close. Garry Southgate pointing to the side of his head as if to say focus. We've lost our focus, and it's been like that for big parts of this football match. Hoiberg looking to the skies, because that is a great opportunity with his right foot, he's got the marker of a player in front of him. Just bend it round and hit the target, it's in the back of the net, he puts it wide, it's a real let-off for England. Oh, massive. Christensen from the corner, then Hoiberg with that shot. And England, at this rate, the phrase that you'll use will be, escape with a draw. We have to go along with the ball, John, every time. I don't think Pickford feels comfortable even setting up to play out at the moment, like Connor said a while ago, just get through this game, 1-1, and then we'll have a row about it afterwards and debrief, but keep it at 1-1 and get your point. We're going into the last five minutes now, and in England, look a world away from winning the Euros on the evidence of what's happened here in this match. Having taken the lead in the 18th minute, Mark Gaye, long and right-footed, Bellingham forward, Gallagher and Dorn chasing after it, but it is Denmark in possession, and Nail are out there, back to the halfway line, across it comes to Hoibier, Hoibier gets it under control, passes it to the right-hand side, this is where Alexander Barr is chasing, but he won't reach that, and it's out of play, and it's a throwing to England. It's been a torrid experience to Garos Southgate and England. I mean, Declan Rice, I'm looking at his body, normally you see Declan Rice, he's got that kind of strut about him, he looks exhausted, and I think he's having to get around the pitch, I think there's space all around him, he's putting in so much work, but getting very little reward in terms of interceptions, challenges, he's just probably feeling his one or two yards off everyone all the time. Oh, as he passes it infield, very nearly given a pulse, and now Gallagher, who's hauled all back, that's a free kick, Christian Norgaard, yellow carded for that, yellow card for the number 15, and England free kick, and that's very welcome. Now any breather, any chance to break up the play, Stones out to the far side, Denmark singing their songs, he has borne, goes on a run, but is easily dispossessed by Hoipje, now Paulson, Paulson then back into the back line to Joachim Anderson. Sun comes brightly out again through the gaps between the stand and the roof, and Denmark with three minutes to play, and the score still level at 1-1. We'll bring you the interviews, we'll bring them live if we can before Spain, Italy, otherwise you'll hear them later, or on the football daily at the Euros, which will be available for you from BBC Sounds in the morning from the usual places. But Denmark with the ball with their three central defenders, Casper Hulman making that little change that we saw, the change of position for the central defenders, it's been a savvy performance from Denmark and Casper Hulman, as the ball is England's for a free kick on the Conegalliga. It's interesting the two centre backs have switched, I think since Saka went off, Christensen's gone into the middle, Investigard is on the left-hand side of the back three, in terms of game plan and tactically, and togetherness they've had, it's been very good from Denmark, they've given a good account of themselves, they're very difficult for England. All Danish fans, and I'm sure many other Danish players as well, really upset about the way things went against them, but Wembley and the semi-finals, they've really given England a fright here. Walker now from the free kick, goes for a long pass now, that's got way too much on it, cheers from the Danish fans who are mocking England really. I can understand, which set plays like that, I mean it's pretty basic, isn't it? Just roll it right and the ball in, it's not been great in quality, has it, from England, you have to say that, but we're still in it, scrapping away, you have to try and take a positive from that sense, it's 1-1, but performance-wise it's not been up to scratch. This is absolutely, you know, confidence, look shot, as the ball comes forward off the head of Paulson, all the way through to Jordan Pickford. So there will be all of the questions, what is it, why is this, where are they, they'll talk about the leaders as well, and whether there's enough of that out on the pitch, as Stones passes the ball here, and it's played in field by Trippia, Eze, and then Declan Rice, Gale passes it back along the six-yard area to Pickford, they don't go long, they go to Stones, and then it's passed out to Gallagher, who's inside the penalty area, then back to Walker, Denmark pressing England back, and Stones fortunate as able to win a throw-in, fire a deflection, and it feels like, like a cat on a hot tin roof for England. Yeah, but I also think Denmark can sense that there's a mistake there, something's coming, they're just going all the way out, the moment it goes short. Never mind Denmark, I think I can... Yeah, I know, I think we're all sat here, I'm just looking to my left and my right, we're all a little bit edgy, everyone's, you know, the raised eyes to everyone, like, what's going on, but we just don't look comfortable having the ball in that part of the pitch. As they win the free kick off his club mate, Joachim Anderson, arm on his shoulder as they went down, Anderson, they'll talk about that next season, free kick taken by England, and we ironed out a time now, there were just three minutes with a blessed relief for England, and they're all getting it, Bellingham is dispossessed, but he was fouled, says referee, Arte Suarez, he has a free kick, and of course there will be discussion as well about what's happened to Bellingham tonight, just flashes of what he can do. Yeah, he hasn't been able to get in the game, and then because it's so disjointed in terms of the structure and where he's without the ball, he's not really been able to play the role out of possession that he probably needs to, everything's stretched, everything's tight and organised and assured, it's been very open. One-one in added time, England taking an edge over the taking of this free kick, and are dangerously flirting by the yellow card there for Pickford who does eventually take it, and then there's a foul on Gae by Paulson, the Danish fans are absolutely furious about that, Stones wanted to take a quick one, but the referee says no, I'm not ready for that, I'm going to bring it back for a free kick, and Paulson again gets to his feet and says, I've only been on the field a few minutes, and you've not given me anything. Yeah, but in fairness, he's trying to step across the path of Mark Gehr, who's coming on to attack the ball, and he's had a whack on the side of his knee, because Gehr, his knee went right into the side of his thigh, but you can't just step across the path of the player going to head it, you're going to get clattered, and that's what happened. Free kick then for England, in added time, 90 seconds of the added time to go. They get a goal out of this and win the match, and that would be such an escape for England. But the free kick is easily headed away on the edge of the Danish area, comes back to Pickford in his own half, he goes long, left footed, looking for Bourne on the far side, that's headed down though for Denmark, and then Gallagher into the challenge, loses out to Mala, Denmark, cleared across the back line to Joakim Andersen. Now, bar, long ball from bar, Trippier's underneath it, Trippier goes down, he gets the free kick for the shove by Skål Olsen, and he stays flat on his face here in Trippier, and Decklin Rice says to Gehr, don't take it yet, that's where they are. Yeah, just slow down, little shove in the back of Trippier, wins the foul, just take the sting out of it, slow it down a little bit, we're just in possession now with John Stones. And so England eventually do take the free kick, with less than 30 seconds of added time to go, they pass back to Pickford, who retreats into his area, and clears it, left footed with Tolsen closing him down, comes through the middle to Watkins, then Bellingham who scores so many late goals for Real Madrid this season, as they enter the penalty area, as they play it across, almost reaches Bourne on the edge of the box, Mailer just got there first, exactly, might just now open up for England in the final 30 seconds, as it's chipped by Stones to the far side, Walker back to Stones, I'll make it the three minutes are up now, referee says that's it, final whistle, and listen to this reaction from the England supporters, listen to this, whistles and cheers and booze all around the stadium here in Frankfurt, that has been a torrid match for Garoselle, in his team, England players drop down, Trippier's on his back, Rice goes down onto his haunches, Walker down there, he's having a stretch, what a night this was, from such a high of Harry Kane giving England the lead in the 18th minute, but from that point on, Denmark took over, and England have been all over the place at times, Real Madrid equalising with a very good goal, ten minutes before the break, but somehow they've got out of that with a point. The play before that goal, John, was pretty steady from England, wasn't it, we were knocking the ball around, looking confident, OK Denmark, maybe we're feeling their way into it, but the moment they did, and that goal was a reaction point, they all of a sudden kicked in Denmark and lost a bit of fear, we've got one goal down, right, let's start to play our game, and we could get to grips with it, didn't get hold of the ball, didn't cope with the amount of possession, couldn't apply pressure, we looked disjointed in the midfield, and that really is the catalyst to a lot of the problem, but it was a disappointing performance, there's absolutely no doubt in that, but we get away with it, with a 1-1 draw, it's a point, you move on to the next game, you regroup, it's tournament football, is it great at the moment, are England on a good run of form, no we're not, we're not playing that well. They simply do not look as though they're building into this tournament, they look as though they're going the other way, and there we are, Denmark won, England won, and the England players going to the England fans, those of whom are still in the stadium, Mark. That was actually going to be my point to easy Christmas to these touch lines, but first of all, are you going down to do interviews? Yes, I am, all right, nothing, nothing to particularly work on the radio, you'd have thought in all of my years. I mean, there'll be an interesting point here, John, because I guess some of them will talk about the pitch, but it was the same for both teams, same for both teams, and you know, the professional players corner, you know, they're not going to use that as an excuse, there's no dressing up. They will mention something about it. Well, they will, which they are entitled to do. Yeah, you can't mention the pitch, it's nothing to do with the pitch, you can talk about the pitch if you want, I think it's more looking and dissecting and looking in the mirror, wearing them out at the minute. I actually think we look a little bit tired, if I'm being honest with you, I think we look a little bit lethargic, I think we look, and it's full-closed to Denmark by the way, they came and put on a performance, but I just think we look a little bit leggy at this moment in time in England. I'm going to go down pitch side to easy, because the first thing I noticed was you look behind you, they have stayed to a man, woman and child in the Danish end, the English end is half empty. Yeah, that is the start contrast, isn't it, Chappers? I think these Danish fans have absolutely loved that performance from their team, it was full of heart grit, they looked sharp, they were fizzing the ball around the pitch, and I thought they were more street-wise than England, I really do, I think they were smart in the way they played out of pressure, and I think that England team, I think the biggest thing that stands out to me is the body language, they looked ejected, as soon as the full-time whistle went, Cure and Trippier fell onto the floor, you had to lie down, players would fall into their knees, the fans are going like you say, and it just seems to be a very weird atmosphere, so it's up to the staff, the substitutes on that bench now for England to pick the team right back up again, because Torna Malfoy-Fubble is all about momentum as we know. I had to say that, I was thinking the same thing, I thought the body language at times was awful, really, I don't know whether they are tired, but there was a lot of shrugging pointing. I've not watched England with an energetic performance for a while, though, which I will say, this isn't something that's come to the table recently, I think building into the March fixtures, certainly the Iceland game, the Serbia game, the worry of it for me is that we've looked quite leggy, relatively early on in the game, it's not just the last 10 minutes where we look tired, I think the movement off the ball, the energy to get away and make space, and then obviously you then adjust in again when the ball turns over, that coming in to going out and up and down and getting the line up, condensing the pitch, then making it bigger, it's a massive amount of work, and we just don't look like we've quite got that energy enough. No, it's been on the pitch. I'm starting to think of the game. Before I go, on the pitch, it's been an issue, hasn't it? The games in March, the performance against Brazil for the most part, part of the Belgian game. Did you feel that? And then into the games, in tune before the tournament, the first half against Bosnia Herzegovina, the whole thing against Iceland, the second half against Serbia, and that's the worry that it's not absolutely coming out of the blue. No. I also think it's affected us knowing we get on the ball then, so it's draining a little bit of confidence. There's an opportunity in the first half, I think, I think, to the Shepherds when Trent could have played forward, and that one he could have played forward, and we just take the easy pass backwards, and the team, again, Mark, where he's sitting that low block, and they're comfortable, and the stop players coming through, it suits them, and adjusting that to equal into our game, a little bit just turning down, playing forward. But also, once it started to go, then towards into the second half, it looked like somebody put a hoover, and was sucking confidence out of the players. Whenever Pickford had the ball to have it short, it was just not an option. Jordan Pickford made good decisions just to go long. One of the things, is that, I mean, I thought that, I mean, in all of this, Denmark deserve a massive amount of praise here. We are obviously looking from an English point of view. Denmark, both in and out of possession, I thought were brilliant today, and England fans might go, it's only been a draw, and England have got four points. But what I noticed with Denmark, where they're in or out of possession, they always knew where they had to be for their teammate. There was a lot of pointing, there was a lot of directing, there was a lot of cajoling. They always knew where they needed to be. Yeah, and I've always thought that being a player, the biggest thing you need is role clarity. And Conor said it at the end of the first half, that they've been playing this system for a long time, three at the back, five across the middle, and two up front. That changes, it looks different during the game. But fundamentally, they play with a three back. Everyone knows their roles, and you look at those three centre-backs for Denmark, and you're like, none of them are rapid, none of them are very good at coming into the ball, none of them are exceptional at playing out from the back when they've got the ball, but what they do is they work as a team, they work as a unit. And I think that was the difference between the two teams, and I just think that the intelligence and the balance that they've got in that team, between Ericsson and the midfield and the forwards, it just works. And sometimes when you've played a system, the same system for a long period of time, and you've got the players that buy into that, it helps and it works. And Denmark and their team come on away from this match this evening with momentum. That back three, Conor. They knew when to step into midfield, if they had to go and pick someone up, pick them into the inside channel. They knew when to hold their line, and in front of them, we said it to each other during the second half. I thought Hoiber was absolutely immense. It was fantastic. It was fantastic, but we spoke about before the game, a matter about getting the ball to Sacher and trying to hit in that channel. I can't remember the time that we've done that, Matt. I can't remember the time where we pulled out Sensorbacks, places where we don't want to be a Sensorback, we don't want to be on a touch line defending, and I can't remember the time England done that, but like you said, great credit to Denmark. They step up the pit, they're aggressive when they need to be aggressive. But what gets me in that formation is how comfortable you can be. In the mid-block, when the other teams got the ball and say, OK, then, come and beat us and let's see what you do. They're not thinking about fundamentals there, though, Conor. If you're going to get the ball out to Sacher, you've got a fast, quick ball that's crisp, that's banged, that has tempo and it has energy, and you're driving that out there, and it's a collect... It never felt like that from... Right from the off. Yes, we had some control possession, but it wasn't that progressive, aggressive stuff, and then we're waiting on somebody to do something individually. And then I think if that doesn't happen, you're in trouble and you get a performance like what we can. Well, when Ezzer came on, is he? I don't think he touched the ball till we got to second half stop beside him, and you sort of think, well, just go on, try going in the inside forward line, and someone get the ball to him and see what you can do, but they never got the ball to him. Well, they didn't because of the height of the back line of Denmark and the space in between them and the midfield. The three players that came on, Bowen, Watkins and Ezzer, they just weren't able to get a foothold in the game and to find and feel the rhythm of the match, because Denmark was so intelligent. It was Andersen, wasn't it, his club teammate up against him from Crystal Palace. As he came on, Andersen kind of had that assurance around his body language, I'll do with this, he's a good player, Ezzer, but he just didn't get a sniff in the game. A couple of times, Olly Watkins ran the channels, but the ball drifted out of play, and they just didn't quite work. That's where England got to think outside the box a little bit and go, if there's no space in behind, we've got to play around them, and that's where Connors are alluding to, we're getting the ball out to Saka quickly, getting midfielders around him to combine and suck players out of their shape. But fundamentally, listen, we've got to sit here and give massive credit to Denmark. That was an unbelievable performance from them. If you're in this England camp now, you know what's coming. I know they shut the noise out and all of that, and maybe they'll be honest about how they feel they've performed tonight. But somehow you have to focus on four points on top of the group, and kind of park this, don't you? It's for us to dissect it. They partly need to park it. Yeah, without a doubt, but what Olly will say is they'll debrief it, they'll go over it because that's the best way to lay in for them. And you've got to lay in for them. There are a lot of players who play on the biggest stage, there are a lot of players in that squad on that pitch tonight who played at this stage numerous times and will understand the feeling of what they're going through, they'll understand the feeling of the supporters, and what Olly will say is he will debrief it, that's something that Garry Salke is always good with his team. But one thing that you've got to do, you've got to look at the group and go right, we're on four points, we can only get better, we have to get better to get anywhere near winning this tournament, we have to get better, and that's all part of debriefing the game and learning and improving. It's a good moment, and it's not just happened. It's been a steady thing, and to get four points playing badly in two games, you've got to step back and go, well hold on a minute, we're not bad then, in terms of we've got some talent or we've got some robustness or we've got some togetherness or we'll defend and we'll scrap it out but we won't play very well. I've got to say every player is running their heart out, to be honest. Everyone looks tired, fatigued, it's not coming together, I'm not stepping back going where we look a little bit, it's just not happening and it's not going well but to have four points is a great position. When Harry Kane was brought up, Karl Walker took the captain's arm and here he is with Kelly Summers. It all started so well but unlike Sunday, you didn't get the result, can you explain that England performance? I think it's tournament football. Listen, this is a good Denmark team and we're top of the group so let's try and take a positive from this game and we're not lost, we've conceded a great strike from outside the box and sometimes you have to take your off to go goals, I thought the first goal was done well and set off really well as we did the other day but we managed not to see the game out but we're top of the group so let's move on to the next game. You were getting forward as a team and both yourself as well, so much early on, why did that change? I think it's just a game, it's a game, you know, obviously. You're sensing the game, you're sensing their feeling, they probably had the upper hand in certain parts of the game so you go off for that. As defenders you try and think of what if rather than me charging forward they go and score and then all of a sudden they're blaming us as a defence that we're not in position. So listen, we've got enough up front to go and score goals and we've got enough as a team to go and defend so listen, let's take it as a point, a well-deserved point and we'll move on to the next game. Is the manager telling you to drop back deeper once you do score? No, no, listen, the manager's expressed that he wants us to play free attacking football. Sometimes in tournament football you have to manage the game. It is what it is, that's why it's so hard to win tournaments just as like the Champions League.
