[0.00 - 7.00] P:1790.57 E:0.079764 |  All have done it, Cameron and Ghana, Senegal tonight attempting to become the first country to do it twice.
[7.00 - 19.00] P:1882.16 E:0.108898 |  The England players take a knee before kick off and then the whistle is blown by the referee tonight who is from El Salvador, Ivan Barton.
[19.00 - 27.00] P:1815.13 E:0.111856 |  And it is Senegal in the green kit with the yellow numbers on the back who get this last 16 match at the World Cup underway.
[27.00 - 39.00] P:1853.15 E:0.114639 |  And there's a foot in there, Harry Maguire is going to have to be quick, Declan Rice has to be quick back to the edge of the area but he is and passes it to Jordan Tickford who puts it out of play on the far side.
[39.00 - 49.00] P:1802.36 E:0.114003 |  So England in the first half, they are in the white kit, first choice, shirts with the blue shoulders, white shorts, white socks and as I say Senegal all in green.
[49.00 - 57.00] P:1790.80 E:0.112703 |  And it is Senegal in possession in the centre circle and Yellow plays the ball out towards the left-hand side.
[57.00 - 69.00] P:1735.89 E:0.114101 |  Ismail Assar has started on the left flank, good possession in the early stages from Senegal who won their last two matches to get through to the knockout stages.
[69.00 - 74.00] P:1763.30 E:0.116083 |  They lost their opening match against Netherlands but then beat Qatar the host and Ecuador to get through.
[74.00 - 82.00] P:1767.23 E:0.116955 |  England with it on the left-hand side and then it comes the challenge to put it out of play for a throw to England the other half way line.
[82.00 - 96.00] P:1771.66 E:0.119810 |  Well Senegal aren't just sitting back when they have the ball, they've got four players pushing high up the pitch, you've got Andi, Diata, Ola Diya, all pushing up with Saar kind of staying wide on the left-hand side.
[96.00 - 110.00] P:1702.73 E:0.116920 |  So whether or not they'll just bypass that midfield area John when they get the ball in the back and just try to get the ball forwards and allow their players to either just get hold of it with a direct pass or whether it's going to make it a bit of a fight that England have to be up for.
[110.00 - 112.00] P:1709.95 E:0.120404 |  They certainly commit in players forward in the early stages.
[112.00 - 119.00] P:1650.82 E:0.109451 |  England with the ball in front of their own penalty area, Harry McQuire and John Stonce together there again.
[119.00 - 124.00] P:1668.29 E:0.112949 |  The feeling would be that at some points it might switch to three central defenders but not tonight.
[124.00 - 130.00] P:1765.15 E:0.111247 |  It's back four again and of course Senegal very much a back four team, very rarely.
[130.00 - 140.00] P:1670.24 E:0.111904 |  There's Alie Wissi, straight from that ball played forward for England up the left-hand side but Sabali is able to come across and play the ball back into a central defence to Culeb Ali.
[140.00 - 145.00] P:1566.10 E:0.111816 |  Brilliant noise coming out from those Senegal supporters down there on the pitch side.
[145.00 - 150.00] P:1525.52 E:0.116706 |  I mean there aren't that many of them, maybe three or four hundred but what a racket they're making.
[150.00 - 154.00] P:1631.46 E:0.111280 |  Sabali playing the ball back into central defence, Culeb Ali now.
[154.00 - 166.00] P:1621.00 E:0.117095 |  A little ball to Mendy in central midfield but he is dispossessed and Jordan Henderson is able to take the ball away towards the far side and win a throw in just beyond the halfway point in the Senegal half.
[166.00 - 171.00] P:1568.10 E:0.117740 |  Yeah, I fully expect Senegal to almost bypass their midfield at times today.
[171.00 - 175.00] P:1585.51 E:0.119940 |  Mendy didn't look particularly comfortable receiving that ball with his back to goal.
[175.00 - 181.00] P:1664.62 E:0.117342 |  And like I've already mentioned the front four players are almost straight along the line so a lot of long passes.
[181.00 - 190.00] P:1620.85 E:0.115314 |  Kane to Henderson on the edge of the area, clicks it out to the left-hand side but that will be allowed to roll beyond Phil Hordens' run and through for a goal kick.
[190.00 - 193.00] P:1637.24 E:0.121637 |  Harry Kane in that position again on the edge of the penalty area.
[193.00 - 197.00] P:1624.48 E:0.116116 |  It's played there, a great effect but yet to get off the mark with goals at this world cup.
[197.00 - 212.00] P:1535.83 E:0.117355 |  Yeah, he's pressed well so far in the game. I mean the midfield's very much looking to be like Declan Rice just sitting by himself in front of Stones and Maguire with Bellingham and Henderson pushing on both of them into those areas higher up the pitch.
[212.00 - 215.00] P:1531.37 E:0.115292 |  Almost a cut of a 4-3-3 really John, isn't it?
[215.00 - 216.00] P:1529.20 E:0.104674 |  That's what it is.
[216.00 - 223.00] P:1529.51 E:0.113447 |  Three minutes play, England nail, Senegal nail and the ball is back with Jordan Pickford. Clean sheets in his last two matches.
[223.00 - 230.00] P:1465.73 E:0.106310 |  England have conceded just the two goals, those late goals against Iran in the opening match.
[230.00 - 238.00] P:1690.70 E:0.117636 |  England are still joint top scorers in this world cup and they've given the ball away on the halfway line and it's played to the Gia through the middle and Gia could be in here.
[238.00 - 248.00] P:1721.88 E:0.118098 |  A weaving run in between two England defenders, Stones and Maguire, but between them they just about did the job and just got a little foot in.
[248.00 - 253.00] P:1559.76 E:0.112745 |  John Stones bounced away and knee from Maguire and Pickford was able to collect.
[253.00 - 262.00] P:1554.96 E:0.118363 |  Well, a very, very early warning sign for England about the directness of Senegal. You lose the ball in that midfield area.
[262.00 - 271.00] P:1580.11 E:0.115765 |  They've got a target in the front in Boulez d'Art, who's just going to get on his bike and run into those spaces and he got the wrong side of Harry Maguire there.
[271.00 - 281.00] P:1525.46 E:0.113798 |  If it wasn't for John Stones coming across and just covering, he just set Boulez d'Art back and allowed Harry Maguire to get back and get a bit of a knee on the ball and just deflect it out of his path.
[281.00 - 284.00] P:1507.83 E:0.118507 |  But for a moment now, I thought he was going to be in for a shot on goal.
[284.00 - 286.00] P:1600.11 E:0.109708 |  Well, that was very direct wasn't it?
[286.00 - 287.00] P:1627.96 E:0.100196 |  Yeah.
[287.00 - 289.00] P:1603.69 E:0.112440 |  A very positive actually from the number nine, Gia.
[289.00 - 298.00] P:1478.63 E:0.115481 |  It's how they're going to play, isn't it? They're going to wait for those opportunities. England took for a sloppy pass in midfield and all of a sudden that first pass is so aggressive, isn't it?
[298.00 - 303.00] P:1518.86 E:0.120163 |  It's just trying to get behind the England or two into the heart of the defence. They're very good at that Senegal.
[303.00 - 312.00] P:1450.94 E:0.112512 |  And Stones and Maguire gave one another a low five after that and then the foul and centrefield, early challenge there.
[312.00 - 323.00] P:1431.00 E:0.108790 |  That did look a little late. Collingham playing it back to Maguire and referee Barton has come across and had a word, actually quite a firm word as well.
[323.00 - 328.00] P:1414.25 E:0.117382 |  He's from behind, isn't it? Late and from behind. Doesn't catch, Bellingham particularly passes.
[328.00 - 329.00] P:1292.04 E:0.112591 |  But they assist with the challenge.
[329.00 - 334.00] P:1452.04 E:0.118957 |  Yeah, they assist. You came in. He's never going to win the ball but it's just one of those early little tackles, isn't it?
[334.00 - 342.00] P:1501.27 E:0.114554 |  You're going to see a few of them in this game just to welcome to the game. We're not going to stand by and allow you just to control the ball in the middle of the park.
[342.00 - 344.00] P:1640.51 E:0.114258 |  England, nil. Senegal, nil.
[344.00 - 349.00] P:1466.16 E:0.111002 |  Five-line and BBC sounds and across Africa on the World Service, as I mentioned.
[349.00 - 356.00] P:1425.13 E:0.109839 |  And it is England with the ball on the edge of their own penalty area. Just knocking it back to Jordan Pickford who put his foot on the ball.
[356.00 - 364.00] P:1427.87 E:0.106765 |  And then England looked to play it out from the back, Rice back to Walker and then Walker down for John Stones, his Manchester City team mate.
[364.00 - 373.00] P:1440.59 E:0.107356 |  Clicked on by Jordan Henderson and then it is taken down by Harry Kane but bounces back to Senegal who have it inside their own half.
[373.00 - 378.00] P:1740.43 E:0.108287 |  And Coulombe Alley plays it forward but Phil Thornton is onto that. In England, England have it.
[378.00 - 380.00] P:1711.13 E:0.121739 |  Quickly, Senegal into the tackle there.
[380.00 - 385.00] P:1775.70 E:0.114960 |  Very quick. They had him surrounded, Phil Thornton and then Jude Dulligan as well who is fouled again.
[385.00 - 387.00] P:1448.82 E:0.106929 |  Three-kicked to England, four-clad to the centre-circle.
[387.00 - 396.00] P:1505.41 E:0.116504 |  Great pressure from Senegal. You can see that when that ball's in that midfield area, the players that have been picked in there, Mendy and Cease, out of possession.
[396.00 - 407.00] P:1553.17 E:0.114744 |  They're just going to get straight after England. Anything just dropping in that area, they're slashing straight onto the pressure and making life difficult just to get that first pass off.
[407.00 - 414.00] P:1421.74 E:0.111756 |  I would say it's probably four-fifths full now, the stadium. You can still see empty seats, empty red seats all around the place.
[414.00 - 424.00] P:1497.29 E:0.111721 |  Those who are here have their eyes on the ball out towards the left side of the middle of the Senegal half and Luke Shaw, in fact it's going to be played square to Walker.
[424.00 - 430.00] P:1631.14 E:0.108817 |  And Walker now plays it in right foot into the back post where it's chested down by Rice and volleyed across the penalty area.
[430.00 - 436.00] P:1635.14 E:0.108697 |  Maguire was after it, couldn't get his head to it and it was cleared away on the edge of the six-yard box.
[436.00 - 440.00] P:1653.07 E:0.111334 |  Thornton nodded Kane, Kane in the D on the edge of the box trying to find a position.
[440.00 - 450.00] P:1507.09 E:0.111598 |  Neri congested in there and the referee spotted a foul against Giata on the edge of his home penalty area and it is a free kick to Senegal.
[450.00 - 455.00] P:1400.57 E:0.119577 |  Straight off the training field wasn't it? That's set-piece. Played square to Karl Walker.
[455.00 - 459.00] P:1494.18 E:0.116308 |  Declan Rice just makes this run around the outside all the way to the back post.
[459.00 - 471.00] P:1453.38 E:0.113088 |  Walker floats it out there, Rice chests it down and just kind of volleys it across the goal, almost slices the ball, takes a bit of pace off it, allows Maguire to go and attack.
[471.00 - 475.00] P:1478.45 E:0.113132 |  It was a well-worked free kick, very nearly dropped to an England player.
[475.00 - 484.00] P:1689.99 E:0.112577 |  You've just switched on, you're just on your way home tonight. England trying to win the ball back with Saka inside the penalty area and it was just about dealt with by Abdul Jalal.
[484.00 - 490.00] P:1547.55 E:0.113093 |  The goalkeeper, Mendy was able to come and pick it up. The news tonight for England, just the one change Garis Southgate made.
[490.00 - 497.00] P:1542.95 E:0.110116 |  Marcus Rashford's on the bench tonight. The whole phase that he'll be able to come on to good effect if necessary later on in the game.
[497.00 - 503.00] P:1513.80 E:0.110723 |  And no Raheem Sterling, not involved at all. The feeling with the family matter.
[503.00 - 508.00] P:1490.92 E:0.114488 |  Senegal hit a long ball downfield and Jordan Pinkman is able to deal with that and catch it at the other end.
[508.00 - 520.00] P:1406.91 E:0.112910 |  Garis Southgate said pre-match to television that Raheem Sterling, Garis Southgate spent quite a bit of time with him this morning but has had to pass that on to other people during the course of the day.
[520.00 - 528.00] P:1444.24 E:0.111382 |  And he was asked whether he will return Sterling and Garis Southgate said he's going to go in way and deal with the matter and we'll have to take it from there.
[528.00 - 534.00] P:1539.77 E:0.113990 |  So that Garis Southgate on Raheem Sterling, he's absent tonight. He is telling him does well actually to ride the challenge.
[534.00 - 546.00] P:1594.85 E:0.109211 |  Has it on the left hand side? Deep Cross, Bendy Dive, doesn't make any contact at all. It's a real Superman dive and Bukai Osaka is able to take the ball up again for England on the right hand side.
[546.00 - 553.00] P:1387.45 E:0.107987 |  Back to Reiss and then England have it again in the centre circle. Yeah, Jude Bellingham's going to have to have a strong night. I think we can see that already, Matt.
[553.00 - 561.00] P:1510.66 E:0.113293 |  Yeah, Superman dive for Bendy but Superman leap from Jude Bellingham to ride that challenge. He goes to ground and just bounces straight back up.
[561.00 - 568.00] P:1373.71 E:0.114084 |  But what a cross, John. It's a shame that Saka just didn't gamble and try and get across the face of the defender in the box.
[568.00 - 574.00] P:1403.32 E:0.113884 |  So I'm looking at the replay of Jude Bellingham. I mean he's straight up on his feet and it's a left foot cross. I mean it's a beautiful ball.
[574.00 - 584.00] P:1469.46 E:0.113217 |  Right between the goalkeeper, slight touch, tremendous. But Saka had just held out a little bit and didn't make his run across the left back.
[584.00 - 594.00] P:1505.33 E:0.109982 |  Loops. England nil, Senegal nil. Long ball forward for England, looking for Thordon. He's headed away by Savali.
[594.00 - 599.00] P:1482.26 E:0.116635 |  And then the referee spotting their Frenchman free kick to England just inside their own heart.
[599.00 - 607.00] P:1409.98 E:0.113257 |  And England looked to take this free kick. Look short out there on the left hand side. Harry Maguire just won this forward.
[607.00 - 615.00] P:1397.99 E:0.116795 |  What an absolute racket there is inside the ground. Not how many drums there are down there in the Senegal section.
[615.00 - 620.00] P:1360.19 E:0.117158 |  But even though they are vastly outnumbered by the England fans inside this ground, that's where the noise is coming from.
[620.00 - 626.00] P:1460.01 E:0.119941 |  I think because there's not much more noise is there. So it kind of like really highlights the drums massively.
[626.00 - 635.00] P:1391.78 E:0.113589 |  England nil, Senegal nil. And Harry Maguire gives it to his footman, Sean, who sets off on a run down the left hand side.
[635.00 - 645.00] P:1457.97 E:0.111069 |  Thordon is there and then the ball is back and driven across field to the right hand side where Saka is able to pull it down on his left foot.
[645.00 - 650.00] P:1339.60 E:0.110872 |  Sending all with two players in front of Bacchio Saka. So England go back into the centre circle again.
[650.00 - 658.00] P:1393.90 E:0.111664 |  John Stones has been a very even start to the game, I must say. Stones then fighting a ball under the chest of Henderson who's out on the right wing.
[658.00 - 666.00] P:1376.54 E:0.111756 |  Has a look in field, swings the ball in, Kane let it go. It was slightly behind him, Bellingham now 30 yards out but running away from the penalty area.
[666.00 - 674.00] P:1438.22 E:0.111834 |  Back to Walker who will use Harry Maguire. Harry Maguire just stretches his legs, gives it to Thordon on the left flank again.
[674.00 - 679.00] P:1388.56 E:0.112770 |  He had to stretch for it also. Maguire, this is a good long period of possession for England.
[679.00 - 684.00] P:1359.05 E:0.112353 |  With Senegal just sitting off England at the moment and then fighting them to try and find their way through.
[684.00 - 689.00] P:1514.71 E:0.113854 |  I'm just watching Jubellingham at the moment, John. I mean he looks so up for this game, I have to say.
[689.00 - 695.00] P:1385.44 E:0.115749 |  His body language is bouncing round the midfield. I mean his hand is going up for the ball constantly.
[695.00 - 700.00] P:1478.55 E:0.124000 |  Even if someone's marking him, he wants the ball and he's just, he looks like he's absolutely buzzing out there.
[700.00 - 703.00] P:1597.29 E:0.120827 |  I think this might be the sort of challenge that he fancies the 19 year old.
[703.00 - 705.00] P:1589.28 E:0.124044 |  I think he certainly looks like he fancies it at the moment.
[705.00 - 709.00] P:1640.35 E:0.112526 |  Ball played over the top for Saka now down the right hand side, folleys it across.
[709.00 - 713.00] P:1453.39 E:0.113481 |  It's gone a long, long way. It's gone all the way to Luke Shaw out towards the left.
[713.00 - 719.00] P:1423.65 E:0.111686 |  Bellingham is there, always available. Bellingham turns away from Sase and then gives it to Thordon.
[719.00 - 726.00] P:1534.23 E:0.114427 |  And Bellingham gets it back. Just about keeps his feet. He's challenged by Cullipally and Cullipally did come out with the ball.
[726.00 - 731.00] P:1503.32 E:0.115466 |  England very nearly finding a way through there. And then Maguire can't keep the ball in.
[731.00 - 737.00] P:1662.10 E:0.120197 |  Or did he? Yes he did keep it in. And he found Kane who crosses right across the front of Saka.
[737.00 - 741.00] P:1562.69 E:0.118307 |  Gorky Bermondi died for him. The ball went between the two of them and out for a thrill.
[741.00 - 747.00] P:1582.61 E:0.124428 |  Well England just started to really apply the pressure. Keeping Senegal pending their own half.
[747.00 - 750.00] P:1675.73 E:0.122451 |  Maguire does really well to keep the ball in. He just lifts it up the line.
[750.00 - 754.00] P:1568.41 E:0.122935 |  Harry Kane is on side. I think it's Diallo who's playing him on.
[754.00 - 759.00] P:1521.30 E:0.121398 |  And it's almost identical kind of cross to what Drew Bellingham put in a moment ago with his left foot.
[759.00 - 765.00] P:1543.40 E:0.117429 |  Flyers it across the face. It's a super ball and Bakayo Saka, what? Just a yard off that.
[765.00 - 769.00] P:1523.29 E:0.113659 |  Otherwise he's on his head in any kind of contact in the back of the net.
[769.00 - 775.00] P:1406.65 E:0.115604 |  It's a good counter attack from England just winning the ball back on the half way line and being very direct.
[776.00 - 785.00] P:1462.48 E:0.114989 |  I can see your old teammate down there Matt, Aliusiise. Old Birmingham City colleague who there was a bit of a doubt over him today.
[785.00 - 791.00] P:1476.65 E:0.114352 |  So they said that he did not do very well. Yes that's right. Couldn't go to the press conference yesterday.
[791.00 - 795.00] P:1525.59 E:0.114241 |  But he's getting up and he's on the bench tonight in his grey tracksuit.
[795.00 - 799.00] P:1585.81 E:0.118998 |  And here's Henderson on the right hand side. There's a late challenge in the middle of that.
[799.00 - 803.00] P:1642.81 E:0.114759 |  Ball played forward to Saka inside the box by Henderson but had through for a goal kick.
[803.00 - 810.00] P:1413.21 E:0.117238 |  And Harry Kane is the latest England player just to take a knock in there.
[810.00 - 814.00] P:1494.31 E:0.119543 |  It's feisty in centre field in this match.
[814.00 - 820.00] P:1558.95 E:0.119445 |  It's a foul as well. It certainly looked a foul late when the ball had gone.
[820.00 - 830.00] P:1572.91 E:0.120446 |  The referee hasn't brought it back. It was a poor challenge. It's a foul and Harry Kane right on the floor looking around thinking why is he not going for a foul there?
[830.00 - 836.00] P:1575.00 E:0.113820 |  We should have a free kick. Let's get a view from Rob Green behind the goal. I'm sure you'll have a view on it Rob.
[836.00 - 840.00] P:1584.27 E:0.100091 |  Yeah, brilliantly. So well. So quick and they hounded him so quickly.
[840.00 - 847.00] P:1683.91 E:0.090167 |  And it was just wonderful feet from Harry Kane. You realise how quickly you've got to think, how quickly you've got to move in there.
[847.00 - 853.00] P:1766.79 E:0.091413 |  They did brilliantly but they certainly have really gone aimed for him when he gets the ball.
[853.00 - 859.00] P:1566.46 E:0.096622 |  And also Harry Maguire. When he gets it, he's pressed from one side of the pitch and they don't allow him out.
[859.00 - 864.00] P:1691.42 E:0.098206 |  John Stones, Karl Walker, George Dickford all played him and they come out on the other side.
[864.00 - 869.00] P:1664.92 E:0.092536 |  And he can't and it's the frustration in there. Just a little bit creeping at the start.
[869.00 - 874.00] P:1751.56 E:0.115935 |  Yeah, this is going to be a challenge tonight from Lillnale.
[874.00 - 881.00] P:1644.52 E:0.117881 |  When England went a throw in down the left-hand side. Kane is OK after that ball across the top of his foot.
[881.00 - 884.00] P:1489.42 E:0.110911 |  And remember he has had a foot problem with Harry Kane.
[884.00 - 890.00] P:1608.85 E:0.117805 |  And here he is stabbing the ball into the box but that is beyond the little dart into the area of Luke Shaw,
[890.00 - 894.00] P:1572.52 E:0.117639 |  Gullgüba, Edouard, Nending and Chelsea as they look him out together.
[894.00 - 900.00] P:1668.96 E:0.126491 |  Yeah, just the first couple of times Kate had the ball. It's just spatial awareness hasn't been quite as raised as sharp as what you normally see.
[900.00 - 904.00] P:1654.68 E:0.121128 |  It's got caught under his feet. He's a little bit unaware on one of them.
[904.00 - 909.00] P:1511.70 E:0.111868 |  Just wondering whether or not he's just got into this game, into the rhythm of this game yet.
[909.00 - 916.00] P:1420.29 E:0.109377 |  England, Nill, Senegal, Nill, Stoneman, heading it forward from inside his own half, Henderson.
[916.00 - 921.00] P:1592.62 E:0.112946 |  And the way that the game has gone over the course of the first 15 minutes,
[921.00 - 926.00] P:1528.89 E:0.116001 |  you can already see exactly why Gareth Southgate has chosen this Henderson race, coming from midfield.
[926.00 - 930.00] P:1449.88 E:0.118147 |  Yeah, because it's going to be a combative area in the pitch. It always is.
[930.00 - 935.00] P:1518.35 E:0.116252 |  But in this game in particular, you can see that Senegal, when they win the ball, they're going to be very, very direct.
[935.00 - 938.00] P:1540.97 E:0.115810 |  And you're going to need your midfield pass to take responsibility.
[938.00 - 943.00] P:1576.09 E:0.118867 |  Track runners especially, because if stones in Maguire get dragged out of position,
[943.00 - 951.00] P:1449.98 E:0.115624 |  you need that midfield pass to fill in because the energy that Senegal have on those kind of attacks, they'll just throw bodies forward.
[951.00 - 957.00] P:1482.79 E:0.111255 |  Great kick to England out on the left side near the halfway line.
[957.00 - 964.00] P:1435.31 E:0.109848 |  Look short, just taps it back into his own half to Maguire now across to Stoneman's.
[964.00 - 968.00] P:1346.76 E:0.110178 |  And England work it to the right-hand side.
[968.00 - 976.00] P:1473.19 E:0.109784 |  Senegal just allowing Walker now to hit that square ball to Maguire.
[976.00 - 981.00] P:1501.33 E:0.115335 |  Here's Declan Rice on the halfway line just looking for Ja'Hu's arriving.
[981.00 - 988.00] P:1709.52 E:0.111483 |  Now Shaw in field take in near the edge of the box, strong challenge from Coulomballi to win it.
[988.00 - 992.00] P:1560.90 E:0.110136 |  The two captains together, Chelsea against Tottenham.
[992.00 - 996.00] P:1721.55 E:0.116499 |  And now, up the right-hand side it goes to EDI.
[996.00 - 999.00] P:1736.20 E:0.118080 |  England, Harry Maguire is having a put in a challenge there.
[999.00 - 1005.00] P:1652.80 E:0.117674 |  John Stones plays him off and die and out of play for a goal kick to England.
[1005.00 - 1008.00] P:1610.96 E:0.120163 |  Well I thought Harry Maguire just about got away with that one.
[1008.00 - 1014.00] P:1522.37 E:0.118932 |  He had a good yard or two and also he had his body across the outer there.
[1014.00 - 1017.00] P:1565.65 E:0.119986 |  Or in die it was, it was just around the outside of him.
[1017.00 - 1019.00] P:1494.35 E:0.120743 |  And I think he should have dealt with that a little bit better.
[1019.00 - 1024.00] P:1512.05 E:0.115812 |  That's going to give confidence to EDI to think even if Maguire's got two yards on him
[1024.00 - 1027.00] P:1450.63 E:0.118101 |  he's going to feel like he can get around him and beat him for pace.
[1027.00 - 1029.00] P:1398.89 E:0.123928 |  I think England just have to be a little bit aware of that.
[1029.00 - 1031.00] P:1441.66 E:0.112678 |  Maybe Luke Shaw stay tucked in.
[1031.00 - 1033.00] P:1463.18 E:0.115127 |  John Stones just edge over the pitch a little bit.
[1033.00 - 1036.00] P:1515.06 E:0.112559 |  They're going to try and isolate him out wide at times.
[1036.00 - 1040.00] P:1600.03 E:0.114903 |  England just winning the ball back inside their own half and Rice playing it back to Declan.
[1040.00 - 1045.00] P:1430.18 E:0.111755 |  So that is the number 13 element and die that we're talking about.
[1045.00 - 1052.00] P:1478.29 E:0.112493 |  The Sheffield United man who has played for the England Colleges team
[1052.00 - 1055.00] P:1225.80 E:0.116663 |  when he was at Barnett and Southgate College
[1055.00 - 1059.00] P:1369.47 E:0.110381 |  which was also a team that Nick Taught played for
[1059.00 - 1062.00] P:1452.78 E:0.110621 |  who's on the bench for England tonight.
[1062.00 - 1065.00] P:1385.14 E:0.115864 |  And die just closing down John Stones
[1065.00 - 1069.00] P:1267.78 E:0.110039 |  and Stones plays it out to Maguire on the left hand side.
[1069.00 - 1072.00] P:1340.99 E:0.108052 |  Certainly when they're getting the opportunity,
[1072.00 - 1079.00] P:1364.65 E:0.111020 |  Dian and Dai are both trying to make life as difficult as possible for Maguire and Stones.
[1079.00 - 1082.00] P:1519.34 E:0.109431 |  Wall catch is nothing to fall back to pick from the edge of the box.
[1082.00 - 1084.00] P:1441.39 E:0.114768 |  How was the drive-in tonight John?
[1084.00 - 1086.00] P:1341.70 E:0.112936 |  Smooth as convene. No problems.
[1086.00 - 1088.00] P:1252.63 E:0.115943 |  No problems at all. Very good tonight.
[1088.00 - 1093.00] P:1321.40 E:0.115311 |  Nothing to report. A rare journey in this World Cup where there was nothing to report.
[1093.00 - 1095.00] P:1535.01 E:0.105151 |  I'm sure I would have heard about it by now if there was.
[1095.00 - 1099.00] P:1437.38 E:0.111545 |  Maguire giving it to Stones to his right.
[1099.00 - 1102.00] P:1235.00 E:0.109237 |  Kyle Walker on the right hand side here at Trippier.
[1102.00 - 1104.00] P:1324.93 E:0.110590 |  On the bench again for this one.
[1104.00 - 1106.00] P:1367.88 E:0.106636 |  Walker and back to Maguire.
[1106.00 - 1110.00] P:1402.21 E:0.114181 |  Maguire will carry the ball forward and cross the halfway line
[1110.00 - 1112.00] P:1272.64 E:0.100429 |  but just angle it to his left.
[1112.00 - 1117.00] P:1297.60 E:0.102834 |  And it's passed forward by Dalingham and Phil Forden back to Jude Dalingham.
[1117.00 - 1121.00] P:1403.31 E:0.107270 |  Again, there's a lovely touch from Foden just before that incident with Maguire
[1121.00 - 1123.00] P:1363.79 E:0.105829 |  where he's flicked it round the corner.
[1123.00 - 1125.00] P:1454.46 E:0.091373 |  It was such a death touch.
[1125.00 - 1128.00] P:1317.61 E:0.107110 |  I don't think Nutmegged is Senegalese defender
[1128.00 - 1131.00] P:1485.35 E:0.108171 |  but it was a beautiful touch inside and very nearly set England off.
[1131.00 - 1134.00] P:1580.12 E:0.102668 |  Just Harry Kane couldn't quite get hold of the pass from Shaw
[1134.00 - 1136.00] P:1591.27 E:0.101307 |  which was a really difficult height
[1136.00 - 1141.00] P:1568.34 E:0.104874 |  but you can see that there's real capabilities in that kind of link-up on that left-hand side.
[1141.00 - 1144.00] P:1353.91 E:0.110505 |  Dalingham just conceding the throw on the far side
[1144.00 - 1147.00] P:1323.90 E:0.105100 |  so it's out of play for the throwing to Senegal.
[1147.00 - 1149.00] P:1450.46 E:0.112586 |  England nil, Senegal nil.
[1149.00 - 1152.00] P:1451.61 E:0.105691 |  It is the first time that England have played African opponents
[1152.00 - 1155.00] P:1448.42 E:0.096593 |  in a knockout match at a World Cup
[1155.00 - 1162.00] P:1494.94 E:0.100887 |  since the famous 3-2 win against Cameroon at Italia 90.
[1162.00 - 1165.00] P:1364.76 E:0.101051 |  And I must say I was looking back at that match today
[1165.00 - 1169.00] P:1417.37 E:0.102078 |  and I cannot help feel just because of the green kit against England.
[1169.00 - 1173.00] P:1519.82 E:0.100528 |  There are definitely memories being stirred by watching this match tonight
[1173.00 - 1175.00] P:1603.21 E:0.107936 |  and that was an incredibly topsy-turvy game
[1175.00 - 1178.00] P:1548.69 E:0.098360 |  that England eventually won by three goals to two in the quarter-finals.
[1178.00 - 1181.00] P:1464.76 E:0.105009 |  Thanks to a couple of Gary Linnick and Taddlepiece,
[1181.00 - 1184.00] P:1542.54 E:0.095861 |  one of which was in extra time to win it.
[1184.00 - 1186.00] P:1575.96 E:0.105393 |  Paul played forward and that's taken a deflection.
[1186.00 - 1189.00] P:1604.92 E:0.108032 |  And England are saying that that should be a corner.
[1189.00 - 1191.00] P:1671.28 E:0.106515 |  I think it's being awarded.
[1191.00 - 1193.00] P:1588.76 E:0.108646 |  The assistant is on it and has given the corner to England.
[1193.00 - 1195.00] P:1618.02 E:0.105667 |  Now that is a very cheap corner.
[1195.00 - 1200.00] P:1556.51 E:0.103719 |  Yeah, well there's a clear touch from Ismail Issaar
[1200.00 - 1203.00] P:1458.64 E:0.110710 |  but I'm not sure if his teammate actually knew it came off of him
[1203.00 - 1207.00] P:1530.74 E:0.106478 |  and they just kind of allowed the ball to trickle out for a set-piece.
[1207.00 - 1209.00] P:1447.64 E:0.106237 |  Now this is interesting for England
[1209.00 - 1211.00] P:1417.72 E:0.120212 |  because I think we've been pretty good at these so far in this tournament.
[1211.00 - 1215.00] P:1514.73 E:0.109655 |  So let's see what the delivery's like with the left footed in-swinger.
[1215.00 - 1216.00] P:1599.36 E:0.104445 |  Yeah, so not only that,
[1216.00 - 1220.00] P:1537.53 E:0.103469 |  Senegal conceded from a corner in their last match against Ecuador.
[1220.00 - 1222.00] P:1626.18 E:0.101258 |  So it is a free-kick from the...
[1222.00 - 1226.00] P:1558.70 E:0.092788 |  So it is a corner from the right-hand side.
[1226.00 - 1228.00] P:1608.90 E:0.109664 |  Garas Southgate said to us yesterday,
[1228.00 - 1231.00] P:1652.46 E:0.096922 |  he feels that England have simply not been effective enough from set-pieces.
[1231.00 - 1236.00] P:1627.19 E:0.104922 |  Forden plays it in and it's headed up and over the top by John Stones arriving.
[1236.00 - 1239.00] P:1544.53 E:0.105281 |  But he was able to get in there, clear header, but arriving at pace.
[1239.00 - 1242.00] P:1542.59 E:0.101102 |  He couldn't keep it down and it flew over the top of the ball.
[1242.00 - 1245.00] P:1589.38 E:0.099725 |  Yeah, he looks straight away to Declan Rice,
[1245.00 - 1247.00] P:1401.16 E:0.110837 |  who I think was making a run away
[1247.00 - 1251.00] P:1407.58 E:0.102292 |  and he's just taking his eye off the ball there, John Stones.
[1251.00 - 1254.00] P:1427.66 E:0.101223 |  It kind of hits him in the shoulder, whether or not his teammate
[1254.00 - 1257.00] P:1590.78 E:0.104693 |  is just in his line of vision and he just misjudges the ball,
[1257.00 - 1262.00] P:1548.47 E:0.097469 |  but it was actually perfect, the delivery from Forden with his left foot
[1262.00 - 1263.00] P:1559.90 E:0.109817 |  and then the run from Stones.
[1263.00 - 1266.00] P:1541.93 E:0.100916 |  I think if Declan Rice had have been across the face of him,
[1266.00 - 1269.00] P:1578.55 E:0.096522 |  he could well have just got header on target.
[1269.00 - 1271.00] P:1433.37 E:0.109016 |  England nail, Senegal nail.
[1271.00 - 1273.00] P:1566.59 E:0.101617 |  Yes, off the John Stones' shoulder.
[1273.00 - 1278.00] P:1480.47 E:0.089771 |  So, goal kick from Senegal playing it out from the back.
[1278.00 - 1282.00] P:1546.58 E:0.097671 |  Ball flicked on down the left-hand side by Jacobs.
[1282.00 - 1284.00] P:1485.00 E:0.088211 |  The left back now bounces forward.
[1284.00 - 1287.00] P:1587.41 E:0.108639 |  Tecfords come out of his penalty area into the full-back position
[1287.00 - 1288.00] P:1677.89 E:0.105618 |  and actually headed away.
[1288.00 - 1292.00] P:1526.75 E:0.098772 |  Stones was there, but the goalkeeper came and it's out for a throw,
[1292.00 - 1299.00] P:1535.56 E:0.100982 |  but Jacobs is going to take Ismael Jacobs, who is German-born,
[1299.00 - 1302.00] P:1594.50 E:0.100773 |  played for the German under-21 team,
[1302.00 - 1305.00] P:1566.60 E:0.094020 |  but his senior level is opted for Senegal.
[1305.00 - 1309.00] P:1491.88 E:0.100795 |  England with Rice winning it back inside his own penalty area,
[1309.00 - 1314.00] P:1609.29 E:0.098231 |  bounces forward off the head of Gia and now folly the way downfield
[1314.00 - 1318.00] P:1596.59 E:0.101735 |  by Kyle Walker with Senegal players either side of Coulibaly.
[1318.00 - 1323.00] P:1604.63 E:0.104364 |  He's able to pass that forward, but Harry Maguire has given it away
[1323.00 - 1326.00] P:1701.59 E:0.108212 |  and England are on the back foot here as the cross comes over
[1326.00 - 1328.00] P:1836.32 E:0.117774 |  and it bounces into the six-yard box.
[1328.00 - 1332.00] P:1704.45 E:0.109190 |  Gia was in there with the initial touch and then,
[1332.00 - 1336.00] P:1734.90 E:0.108634 |  and Di in the six-yard box blazed it over the top
[1336.00 - 1340.00] P:1678.23 E:0.099039 |  and I think Gia is suggesting he might have been fouled.
[1340.00 - 1342.00] P:1747.09 E:0.110160 |  That's what he's saying to the referee.
[1342.00 - 1346.00] P:1722.60 E:0.104122 |  Yeah, I think he's looking at the foul as the ball comes in,
[1346.00 - 1349.00] P:1680.58 E:0.106380 |  whether or not John Stones just knees him in the back.
[1349.00 - 1353.00] P:1620.74 E:0.105607 |  It's Ismael Assar who gets all the way across to the six-yard box
[1353.00 - 1355.00] P:1584.41 E:0.110279 |  and it's an opportunity born out of,
[1355.00 - 1358.00] P:1652.06 E:0.101460 |  well, I think he's appealing for a handball possibly,
[1358.00 - 1361.00] P:1509.67 E:0.104512 |  it just flicks off John Stones' hip and hits him in his left arm.
[1361.00 - 1363.00] P:1320.82 E:0.105129 |  I mean, it's such a close connection.
[1363.00 - 1368.00] P:1423.12 E:0.098819 |  That's happened just a few yards away from where Rob Green is standing behind the goal.
[1368.00 - 1373.00] P:1694.03 E:0.096341 |  Yep, and it's the reaction to Jordan Pitt for trying to get a block in.
[1373.00 - 1377.00] P:1575.83 E:0.095654 |  He does really, really well because he realises he's not going to get there first
[1377.00 - 1380.00] P:1596.50 E:0.094943 |  and decides to make himself as big as possible and stand.
[1380.00 - 1383.00] P:1610.72 E:0.098272 |  Now as a goalkeeper, there's very little you can do other than that.
[1383.00 - 1385.00] P:1583.83 E:0.091064 |  He doesn't decide to play the ball.
[1385.00 - 1389.00] P:1640.93 E:0.097136 |  They've restarted so there's clearly nothing to be had in it,
[1389.00 - 1392.00] P:1718.89 E:0.093720 |  but it's good goalkeeping because if he had gone and made the lunge
[1392.00 - 1396.00] P:1439.91 E:0.088581 |  and gone with his hands, I think that would have been a case for a penalty.
[1396.00 - 1400.00] P:1423.56 E:0.103283 |  However, that was a big opportunity for Ismael Assar in the six-yard box
[1400.00 - 1402.00] P:1597.60 E:0.102149 |  and placed it over the top.
[1402.00 - 1405.00] P:1526.22 E:0.105841 |  But they did look, Ziv B.A.R. had a look, it sat on our screen,
[1405.00 - 1410.00] P:1591.63 E:0.099192 |  but it was just a quick look and the ball deflected off his body onto his arm
[1410.00 - 1412.00] P:1624.03 E:0.097782 |  that was out of his sight.
[1412.00 - 1414.00] P:1500.68 E:0.104278 |  Next to each other, so I mean, there's no reaction time.
[1414.00 - 1416.00] P:1594.58 E:0.099831 |  It's just one of those things.
[1416.00 - 1417.00] P:1460.68 E:0.107135 |  Another warning.
[1417.00 - 1419.00] P:1553.58 E:0.097422 |  It's twice now that England have been caught out more
[1419.00 - 1422.00] P:1606.94 E:0.110027 |  when we're in possession at the back and we're a little bit stretched
[1422.00 - 1425.00] P:1560.77 E:0.101321 |  because we want to have the ball, we want to make the pitch big.
[1425.00 - 1429.00] P:1435.09 E:0.115407 |  But if our pass is not quite right, which in two occasions we've given the ball away,
[1429.00 - 1433.00] P:1572.48 E:0.110559 |  we're in trouble, John, because the speed in which Senegal
[1433.00 - 1436.00] P:1634.25 E:0.110581 |  get the ball forwards in the directness of their attack in plays
[1436.00 - 1438.00] P:1596.85 E:0.104334 |  is going to cause us problems.
[1438.00 - 1441.00] P:1490.47 E:0.106090 |  England nil, Senegal nil.
[1442.00 - 1447.00] P:1383.55 E:0.103819 |  Stolz and McGuire just finding one another with passes
[1447.00 - 1450.00] P:1410.36 E:0.096955 |  and then using Pickford again behind him.
[1450.00 - 1454.00] P:1343.59 E:0.099847 |  But certainly when Ismael Assar stole in there, the Watford man,
[1454.00 - 1458.00] P:1537.59 E:0.104457 |  in the six-yard area, he went for power, absolutely blazed it.
[1458.00 - 1464.00] P:1322.78 E:0.093895 |  He's been diving down in his feet, but clear chance for Senegal, not taken.
[1464.00 - 1469.00] P:1420.66 E:0.104455 |  McGuire now turns and steps forward, and that gives it away.
[1469.00 - 1471.00] P:1599.05 E:0.104693 |  Misplaced pass from McGuire.
[1471.00 - 1473.00] P:1533.26 E:0.105321 |  He's out of position now, but Declan Rice comes back in.
[1473.00 - 1474.00] P:1373.45 E:0.097517 |  This is straight away, John.
[1474.00 - 1476.00] P:1463.06 E:0.108962 |  They're not looking to get a pass off Senegal.
[1476.00 - 1478.00] P:1498.49 E:0.101226 |  They don't want to pop the ball sideways or backwards
[1478.00 - 1480.00] P:1569.35 E:0.097657 |  or keep possession and try and control the game.
[1480.00 - 1482.00] P:1448.08 E:0.105514 |  They're winning the ball and going back.
[1482.00 - 1483.00] P:1534.86 E:0.091854 |  We're going to put it straight behind.
[1483.00 - 1486.00] P:1397.62 E:0.101518 |  We're going to put it in to our front player, Bouledier.
[1486.00 - 1490.00] P:1470.81 E:0.105090 |  He's running the other side of John Stones and McGuire and putting them under pressure.
[1490.00 - 1494.00] P:1403.27 E:0.099708 |  They clearly see that as a game plan of how they're going to beat England today.
[1495.00 - 1498.00] P:1422.39 E:0.107977 |  So England in possession with John Stolz,
[1498.00 - 1501.00] P:1313.61 E:0.105703 |  who just gives it out to the left-hand side to McGuire.
[1501.00 - 1505.00] P:1371.42 E:0.095447 |  But I think we've seen what, 25 minutes now, Matt,
[1505.00 - 1508.00] P:1425.99 E:0.103516 |  I think it's clear that this could be a tight tussle.
[1508.00 - 1510.00] P:1486.89 E:0.093468 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[1510.00 - 1514.00] P:1379.27 E:0.102559 |  And I think sometimes, you know, there's far too much time on the ball.
[1514.00 - 1516.00] P:1547.11 E:0.102257 |  McGuire's just stopped the ball there for probably three seconds.
[1516.00 - 1517.00] P:1437.27 E:0.108111 |  He's not moved.
[1517.00 - 1520.00] P:1691.10 E:0.104037 |  I think keep it ticking quickly and then allow the pitcher to change.
[1520.00 - 1524.00] P:1667.36 E:0.102120 |  But also getting behind a little bit, clip a couple over the top,
[1524.00 - 1529.00] P:1603.43 E:0.099172 |  you know, stretch the Senegalese back, do what they're trying to do to us
[1529.00 - 1532.00] P:1483.99 E:0.105278 |  and just get their defenders turned and running back towards their own goal,
[1532.00 - 1535.00] P:1460.02 E:0.106402 |  which just makes the pitcher a bit bigger to play on.
[1535.00 - 1538.00] P:1502.11 E:0.105746 |  There's been promising moments for England when they've been coming forward,
[1538.00 - 1541.00] P:1585.24 E:0.098278 |  but a couple of dicey moments at the back.
[1541.00 - 1545.00] P:1540.86 E:0.098186 |  Rice. So it is England now on the front foot and attacking,
[1545.00 - 1549.00] P:1501.30 E:0.097352 |  moving into Senegal territory, Bellingham back to Rice again.
[1549.00 - 1551.00] P:1533.32 E:0.103947 |  It's going to go square, it does.
[1551.00 - 1556.00] P:1417.27 E:0.096773 |  John Stolz puts his foot on the ball, turns back to his left and gives it to Rice.
[1556.00 - 1560.00] P:1510.98 E:0.106103 |  Foden comes into a more central area, looks sure as pushed forward.
[1560.00 - 1563.00] P:1640.51 E:0.101396 |  Saka's through the middle now, Foden gives it back to Saka.
[1563.00 - 1566.00] P:1518.99 E:0.103745 |  And Saka's appeared on the left-hand side, tried to lift it,
[1566.00 - 1569.00] P:1509.69 E:0.098433 |  so to scoop it into the penalty area, but didn't beat the defender.
[1569.00 - 1576.00] P:1647.45 E:0.107477 |  And then Rice is challenged by Ndai, and it's out of play for a throw into England.
[1576.00 - 1579.00] P:1517.18 E:0.103083 |  It's quite a difficult custom, isn't it, of Ndai?
[1579.00 - 1582.00] P:1358.01 E:0.116134 |  He looks to be a little bit everywhere and he doesn't give any ball up.
[1582.00 - 1586.00] P:1481.89 E:0.105291 |  I have to say, even when Maguire or Rice's look favourite there,
[1586.00 - 1588.00] P:1407.43 E:0.113684 |  he's always going to try and win the ball
[1588.00 - 1592.00] P:1461.85 E:0.099041 |  and makes life difficult for the opposition player.
[1592.00 - 1596.00] P:1474.77 E:0.107604 |  Jordan Pickford has to stretch to deal with the ball on the edge of his own box
[1596.00 - 1599.00] P:1404.03 E:0.094108 |  and gives it out to Harry Maguire.
[1599.00 - 1604.00] P:1424.70 E:0.098774 |  So Maguire and England again with this patient start.
[1604.00 - 1610.00] P:1483.30 E:0.104998 |  Since there will be frustration from all of those seats filled with England supporters behind the goal.
[1610.00 - 1614.00] P:1504.32 E:0.098533 |  You know, when England have come forward and have looked positive
[1614.00 - 1617.00] P:1409.81 E:0.096699 |  and they've had that zip about it, but it's almost like again,
[1617.00 - 1624.00] P:1543.48 E:0.096232 |  the two sides of the match, the two sides of England's game almost don't link together.
[1624.00 - 1628.00] P:1559.71 E:0.111685 |  I'm interested to hear Greeny's opinion on how we're moving the ball at the back there, Rob.
[1628.00 - 1630.00] P:1520.91 E:0.100502 |  Is it a little bit slow for you?
[1631.00 - 1636.00] P:1658.34 E:0.103616 |  Yeah, it looks a little bit measured at times, I think because of the mistakes that have been made.
[1636.00 - 1639.00] P:1589.89 E:0.099424 |  And there's a slight lack of movement in the forward areas.
[1639.00 - 1643.00] P:1652.16 E:0.092564 |  Players are getting themselves isolated standing still.
[1643.00 - 1647.00] P:1612.46 E:0.094579 |  But from there, it's very difficult to go forward as a defender, as you well know.
[1647.00 - 1652.00] P:1623.80 E:0.090933 |  Also, just the two contrasts at one end of the pitch, you've got thousands of England fans
[1652.00 - 1658.00] P:1618.06 E:0.091065 |  really, really watching into invested intensive and not really getting involved at the other end.
[1658.00 - 1662.00] P:1579.65 E:0.084600 |  There's not as many fans, but just one big party going on at the other.
[1662.00 - 1663.00] P:1560.81 E:0.081508 |  It's brilliant to watch.
[1663.00 - 1667.00] P:1487.67 E:0.094951 |  It's extraordinary. It's almost out of our eye line down to our right.
[1667.00 - 1673.00] P:1503.94 E:0.100343 |  We sort of have to crane around the top tier and pass the camera, but they are all swaying together.
[1673.00 - 1678.00] P:1393.66 E:0.094358 |  And in order to the scenes of this World Cup, all of those Senegal fans.
[1678.00 - 1681.00] P:1486.95 E:0.089731 |  England playing the ball from the left-hand side.
[1682.00 - 1684.00] P:1644.13 E:0.094628 |  Short and Foden together.
[1684.00 - 1689.00] P:1526.29 E:0.097342 |  Foden is forced away and then Ballingham gives the touch back to the halfway line.
[1689.00 - 1691.00] P:1516.08 E:0.104843 |  Yeah, well coached this Senegal team.
[1691.00 - 1694.00] P:1446.53 E:0.103281 |  We can see this already being in charge for a long time.
[1694.00 - 1697.00] P:1427.88 E:0.094902 |  Al-Yusisi, seven and a half years in the job now.
[1697.00 - 1699.00] P:1373.94 E:0.099990 |  Jordan Henderson coming back into his own half.
[1699.00 - 1702.00] P:1480.98 E:0.093090 |  Absolute legend of Senegal football.
[1702.00 - 1705.00] P:1462.54 E:0.097709 |  There's a long pass from the back by John Stones.
[1705.00 - 1710.00] P:1556.04 E:0.094487 |  He's headed in field by Walker, but he drifted out of play before Walker got to it.
[1710.00 - 1713.00] P:1579.79 E:0.099776 |  And it's a throwing to Senegal inside their own half.
[1713.00 - 1717.00] P:1474.29 E:0.102461 |  So this is the second World Cup that Al-Yusisi has taken Senegal to as a coach.
[1717.00 - 1723.00] P:1550.39 E:0.097492 |  But he was also the captain of that famous team that I watched in Korea back in 2002.
[1723.00 - 1728.00] P:1527.01 E:0.095607 |  And in the very first match of the tournament, their first match at a World Cup,
[1728.00 - 1732.00] P:1491.35 E:0.098379 |  they beat the defending champions France by one goal to nil.
[1732.00 - 1737.00] P:1427.52 E:0.098348 |  It was one of the most remarkable turn-ups I think I've ever seen live in a sporting stadium.
[1737.00 - 1742.00] P:1334.57 E:0.101735 |  I mean, he looks like he manages how he played, John, to be honest.
[1742.00 - 1746.00] P:1353.98 E:0.103417 |  Training, just remembering, very uncompromising.
[1746.00 - 1748.00] P:1307.67 E:0.101348 |  Once he got on the grass, it was business.
[1748.00 - 1751.00] P:1467.68 E:0.112098 |  And the look in the eyes was very, very serious.
[1751.00 - 1754.00] P:1330.52 E:0.101638 |  And I think I'm watching him pacing around that technical area.
[1754.00 - 1757.00] P:1301.60 E:0.102534 |  He has not stood still when the messages, the intensities,
[1757.00 - 1759.00] P:1274.56 E:0.116592 |  constantly being delivered to his players.
[1759.00 - 1763.00] P:1359.86 E:0.102394 |  Just a little delay there because Mendy and Saka had a little set to.
[1763.00 - 1766.00] P:1435.95 E:0.101621 |  That's a Premier League challenge, isn't it?
[1766.00 - 1768.00] P:1371.24 E:0.099975 |  Arsenal and Leicester together.
[1768.00 - 1771.00] P:1377.15 E:0.101678 |  And then Senegal win a free kick just inside the England half.
[1771.00 - 1774.00] P:1459.24 E:0.098403 |  So a chance for a set piece that Jaloh is going to take.
[1774.00 - 1777.00] P:1440.89 E:0.094601 |  Jaloh, now at Abilipesig.
[1777.00 - 1781.00] P:1546.99 E:0.101232 |  So playing alongside Fadiol, who we were so impressed with the other night
[1781.00 - 1783.00] P:1520.17 E:0.095375 |  when we were watching Croatia against Belgium.
[1783.00 - 1784.00] P:1487.55 E:0.097415 |  He's a player, isn't he?
[1784.00 - 1785.00] P:1290.59 E:0.084960 |  He's a player, isn't he?
[1785.00 - 1786.00] P:1649.45 E:0.101823 |  He's a me, Jus.
[1786.00 - 1787.00] P:1427.29 E:0.097353 |  Jaloh then slips it forward.
[1787.00 - 1790.00] P:1467.97 E:0.099375 |  Mendy now, little Mendy of Leicester, right foot at pass.
[1790.00 - 1792.00] P:1352.37 E:0.106143 |  Way out to the right-hand side.
[1792.00 - 1795.00] P:1258.64 E:0.095277 |  Sabele is able to get that ball down.
[1795.00 - 1797.00] P:1398.33 E:0.088576 |  Good movement from Senegal.
[1797.00 - 1799.00] P:1452.68 E:0.100251 |  And then centrally, and Dai.
[1799.00 - 1802.00] P:1332.51 E:0.093670 |  And Senegal now keeping possession well.
[1802.00 - 1806.00] P:1560.85 E:0.092397 |  And actually, Kulabali takes up possession.
[1806.00 - 1807.00] P:1494.64 E:0.093225 |  Send a field.
[1807.00 - 1810.00] P:1265.62 E:0.094627 |  Mendy now out towards the right-hand side.
[1810.00 - 1812.00] P:1313.20 E:0.095947 |  And England having to defend here.
[1812.00 - 1819.00] P:1446.52 E:0.091398 |  Mendy gets a little ball back towards the right-hand side to Crepegiatta.
[1819.00 - 1825.00] P:1476.87 E:0.094952 |  And now, again, Senegal just forced to give it back towards the halfway line.
[1825.00 - 1829.00] P:1541.96 E:0.096882 |  And Mendy exchanging passes once again.
[1829.00 - 1833.00] P:1459.96 E:0.097879 |  And it comes all the way back to Jaloh inside his own half.
[1833.00 - 1837.00] P:1569.45 E:0.097553 |  And with Jordan Henderson putting pressure on him,
[1837.00 - 1839.00] P:1529.94 E:0.094327 |  he has to turn and give it back to the goalkeeper.
[1839.00 - 1841.00] P:1357.54 E:0.103504 |  And Henderson goes all the way back to the goalkeeper.
[1841.00 - 1844.00] P:1484.74 E:0.091176 |  Maguire now after the long clearance from Mendy.
[1844.00 - 1847.00] P:1557.69 E:0.093270 |  Shaw is tight on and Dai on the far side.
[1847.00 - 1849.00] P:1285.53 E:0.107444 |  And Dai is able to get away with the ball down.
[1849.00 - 1850.00] P:1676.78 E:0.099254 |  This is good from Senegal.
[1850.00 - 1853.00] P:1566.93 E:0.107434 |  It is. It's a shame we couldn't pick up that second ball once.
[1853.00 - 1854.00] P:1734.95 E:0.115059 |  Maguire won the initial head here.
[1854.00 - 1857.00] P:1653.28 E:0.107572 |  Great pressure from Jordan Henderson that forced a long kick.
[1857.00 - 1860.00] P:1696.74 E:0.103588 |  And you feel like if we turn the ball over there and win it,
[1860.00 - 1861.00] P:1504.37 E:0.112864 |  all of a sudden we're in business.
[1861.00 - 1864.00] P:1641.55 E:0.110322 |  Saka has given it away and Saar now into the area.
[1864.00 - 1865.00] P:1771.07 E:0.100562 |  He's on his right foot.
[1865.00 - 1868.00] P:1714.99 E:0.108306 |  He's been forced away from the box, but he slipped it into the box.
[1868.00 - 1872.00] P:1768.39 E:0.108224 |  And Diya with a shot from the left-hand side is well saved by Pickford.
[1872.00 - 1874.00] P:1810.03 E:0.105380 |  Throughout a left arm, the shot from the angle.
[1874.00 - 1876.00] P:1661.75 E:0.107429 |  There was a defender there as well.
[1876.00 - 1877.00] P:1774.40 E:0.108550 |  Pickford makes the save.
[1877.00 - 1878.00] P:1632.56 E:0.097547 |  Brilliant save.
[1878.00 - 1883.00] P:1621.65 E:0.108187 |  Jordan Pickford really was very sharp with his left hand.
[1883.00 - 1886.00] P:1539.80 E:0.103850 |  I mean, super strong arm, mistake from Saka.
[1886.00 - 1888.00] P:1540.74 E:0.114040 |  The ball gets maneuvered back wide
[1888.00 - 1890.00] P:1704.42 E:0.115489 |  and there's just a little half a yard of space.
[1890.00 - 1894.00] P:1730.24 E:0.111499 |  And it's a really sharp save with his left arm.
[1894.00 - 1898.00] P:1829.75 E:0.119133 |  And again, Rob Green, that was very close to where you're standing.
[1898.00 - 1900.00] P:1886.82 E:0.115727 |  Yep, there was a clear handball in the build-up.
[1900.00 - 1904.00] P:1851.88 E:0.090783 |  So I don't think it would have stood but Jordan Pickford standing.
[1904.00 - 1907.00] P:1718.01 E:0.095776 |  I don't think the temptation is that to go down early.
[1907.00 - 1909.00] P:1768.19 E:0.087026 |  You know the strikes come in what he did.
[1909.00 - 1913.00] P:1700.80 E:0.093923 |  He stood and waited and he got full extension into the dive
[1913.00 - 1917.00] P:1759.51 E:0.088166 |  and managed to get such a strong hand because of that full extension,
[1917.00 - 1920.00] P:1651.13 E:0.094037 |  triple extension in there and beat the ball away.
[1920.00 - 1926.00] P:1785.54 E:0.090567 |  So all every effort of energy that Jordan Pickford could muster was into that save.
[1928.00 - 1929.00] P:1610.65 E:0.107044 |  England nil.
[1929.00 - 1931.00] P:1529.10 E:0.097308 |  Sanagall nil.
[1931.00 - 1934.00] P:1518.32 E:0.105482 |  And Sanagall have had a good 5-10 minutes.
[1934.00 - 1939.00] P:1462.29 E:0.105786 |  They have and England haven't been able to move the ball quick enough
[1939.00 - 1941.00] P:1636.24 E:0.095365 |  and really create any spaces.
[1941.00 - 1944.00] P:1569.40 E:0.103237 |  And I understand that Sanagall are very well set
[1944.00 - 1945.00] P:1538.00 E:0.103500 |  but we have to switch it up.
[1945.00 - 1947.00] P:1548.29 E:0.108471 |  Maguire just now going along with his right foot.
[1947.00 - 1950.00] P:1543.63 E:0.105740 |  Even if it is go long and then pick up a second ball
[1950.00 - 1952.00] P:1610.35 E:0.101035 |  and we're higher up the pitch and then England can play.
[1952.00 - 1956.00] P:1480.53 E:0.104495 |  But we've got speed up the way we're moving the ball across the back fore.
[1956.00 - 1960.00] P:1661.04 E:0.091832 |  Harry Kane drops deep and overruns it.
[1960.00 - 1962.00] P:1549.08 E:0.098776 |  However, Bellingham challenges for it.
[1962.00 - 1963.00] P:1796.33 E:0.102479 |  Lands at the feet of Kane.
[1963.00 - 1965.00] P:1678.53 E:0.108205 |  Kane across to Sacher in the box but there is cover there.
[1965.00 - 1968.00] P:1751.08 E:0.103663 |  Left back Jack-Ups coming across shoulder to shoulder with Sacher
[1968.00 - 1972.00] P:1740.78 E:0.102591 |  and got enough of the touch to send it back to a goalkeeper.
[1972.00 - 1974.00] P:1641.06 E:0.108193 |  Sorry, Jo, I think we just had a little bit of a shoulder to shoulder there.
[1974.00 - 1976.00] P:1657.42 E:0.107688 |  I just had a little twitch up there.
[1976.00 - 1979.00] P:1574.32 E:0.107841 |  Just thought I was Sacher arriving in the box trying to get across me defender
[1979.00 - 1982.00] P:1659.16 E:0.112837 |  but little moment Harry Kane just saw the run.
[1982.00 - 1988.00] P:1478.83 E:0.096023 |  Decent ball over the top but Sacher couldn't get across the left back Jack-Ups.
[1988.00 - 1990.00] P:1594.19 E:0.113259 |  Physically they look good Senegal, don't they?
[1990.00 - 1996.00] P:1385.48 E:0.100428 |  I think England are going to have to really work the ball well to win that physical tussle.
[1996.00 - 2000.00] P:1527.26 E:0.108870 |  It just feels almost like chalk and cheese, the two sides of England's play.
[2000.00 - 2002.00] P:1417.94 E:0.090494 |  Yep, very much so.
[2002.00 - 2006.00] P:1580.39 E:0.100860 |  And at the moment Senegal probably in the last five, ten minutes
[2006.00 - 2010.00] P:1414.39 E:0.095260 |  have had the better share of the action and territory.
[2010.00 - 2017.00] P:1554.45 E:0.091760 |  Still goalless with just over ten minutes to go to half time.
[2017.00 - 2020.00] P:1632.18 E:0.105614 |  Galles Southgate with Rashford on the bench tonight.
[2020.00 - 2025.00] P:1499.23 E:0.090114 |  The clear indication from him that he intends to bring on Rashford.
[2025.00 - 2029.00] P:1458.80 E:0.100065 |  But Senegal have posed problems and may have had the better chances.
[2029.00 - 2033.00] P:1381.88 E:0.101594 |  The better opportunities to score the first goal of this last 16 time.
[2033.00 - 2038.00] P:1479.80 E:0.102358 |  The winners will play France with Killian and Bapé showing again today
[2038.00 - 2044.00] P:1404.05 E:0.101215 |  what he's capable of with those two goals that make him the five goal leading scorer at this World Cup.
[2044.00 - 2051.00] P:1415.41 E:0.098123 |  They made their intentions very clear, Matt, with what they did in that victory over Poland today.
[2051.00 - 2058.00] P:1530.47 E:0.099759 |  Yeah, they have a certain swagger, don't they, the French, about the confidence about how they play.
[2058.00 - 2063.00] P:1473.70 E:0.102864 |  Almost, you know, at times to think we don't need to worry too much about the defensive side of the game.
[2063.00 - 2065.00] P:1309.90 E:0.101807 |  We're just so good at this.
[2065.00 - 2067.00] P:1306.13 E:0.099310 |  And that's what they do.
[2067.00 - 2072.00] P:1394.20 E:0.109350 |  Looking at this England performance in the first half, we want to see that kind of arrogance a bit more, especially with the ball.
[2072.00 - 2075.00] P:1583.06 E:0.098866 |  This plays pass from Stones, Henderson couldn't get to it.
[2075.00 - 2080.00] P:1415.42 E:0.094367 |  Now Senegal come again with Ismail Assar on the left-hand side.
[2080.00 - 2084.00] P:1572.75 E:0.102484 |  Jacobs is there as well, pass Walker, in comes the cross, but that's headed away by Stones.
[2084.00 - 2093.00] P:1608.19 E:0.100564 |  Jacobs again, Saka putting the challenge on him, bounces out of play off the England man to throw in near the corner flag.
[2093.00 - 2098.00] P:1461.12 E:0.104145 |  England, tentative at the back, little mistakes.
[2098.00 - 2101.00] P:1370.20 E:0.097132 |  Not very sure about passing at the moment, are we?
[2101.00 - 2108.00] P:1505.20 E:0.107224 |  Not building up at all, not really firing passes in and breaking lines, or even hitting long balls with any conviction and quality.
[2108.00 - 2116.00] P:1595.70 E:0.096573 |  Kane, Harry Kane just gets away from Giallo and then tries to curl along pass, it bounces, actually deflected to Saka.
[2116.00 - 2123.00] P:1596.60 E:0.100258 |  And now Kane has a look over his shoulder and is able to find the pass to Shaw, Thorin's available.
[2123.00 - 2129.00] P:1673.04 E:0.102653 |  He's not seen enough of the ball, Thorin yet in this match, does well, gets to his feet, two Senegal players with him, Shaw.
[2129.00 - 2134.00] P:1497.21 E:0.103502 |  Now towards Bellingham near the edge of the area, just arrives on the scene, just glides into position.
[2134.00 - 2140.00] P:1445.12 E:0.096786 |  Jude Bellingham, Rice just caps it back to McGuire near the halfway line.
[2140.00 - 2144.00] P:1635.90 E:0.101111 |  Just feels like first goal in this match is so important.
[2144.00 - 2151.00] P:1620.21 E:0.094763 |  I think you said that before the match, long pass forward is headed away by Jacobs, and so Senegal back in possession.
[2151.00 - 2160.00] P:1723.37 E:0.110136 |  Walker is up against Ismail Asar, and Ismail Asar is away from him, and Walker was using his arms there to pull back the Watford man,
[2160.00 - 2162.00] P:1708.27 E:0.106118 |  and that's a free kick.
[2162.00 - 2169.00] P:1566.11 E:0.109484 |  England have yet to receive a yellow card at this World Cup, but the referee from El Salvador is just going to give Kyle Walker a warning.
[2169.00 - 2172.00] P:1551.90 E:0.093789 |  Well, I mean it is a foul.
[2172.00 - 2178.00] P:1657.11 E:0.108760 |  I suppose you can look at the say there isn't that much contact, but Walker does get done around the touch line,
[2178.00 - 2183.00] P:1649.60 E:0.112449 |  and Sartre just too slippery for him the way, he just kind of wormed around the outside of him.
[2183.00 - 2190.00] P:1628.51 E:0.112116 |  Walker always trying to get back, and Alucice gesturing to the referee, and I think because the challenge from behind, John,
[2190.00 - 2193.00] P:1711.86 E:0.114275 |  he's got every right to question why that isn't a yellow card.
[2193.00 - 2200.00] P:1561.83 E:0.104567 |  Yeah, that's quite significant. You know, there's already been a lot of talk, isn't there, about Kyle Walker against Killian and Batley in the next game,
[2200.00 - 2204.00] P:1630.70 E:0.102879 |  but he's got his hands full here with Ismail Asar of Watford.
[2204.00 - 2207.00] P:1655.79 E:0.093341 |  Still Mil-Nil, but not Watford.
[2207.00 - 2210.00] P:1657.13 E:0.100221 |  Senegal with this free kick on the left flank.
[2210.00 - 2222.00] P:1497.20 E:0.097681 |  So England holding a line outside the penalty area, might be swung in with the right foot from Crepegdiata of Monaco,
[2222.00 - 2228.00] P:1593.53 E:0.102910 |  or alternatively it is the left foot delivery to the edge of the box, which is headed away by Walker,
[2228.00 - 2236.00] P:1554.90 E:0.094652 |  but it comes out for Senegal, and Dai on the right flank onto his left foot, and Dai has Declan Rice there with him,
[2236.00 - 2243.00] P:1409.87 E:0.100332 |  so he wasn't able to get into a position to have a shot at goal, and Senegal go back to the halfway line.
[2245.00 - 2250.00] P:1511.62 E:0.103941 |  Ball's been carried forward, Sabley makes a run down the right, and Dai is there as well,
[2250.00 - 2256.00] P:1639.59 E:0.110738 |  but then Dai's pass wheels over hit through into the penalty area, and it's all the way through for a goal kick,
[2256.00 - 2259.00] P:1639.53 E:0.099203 |  and it remains Mil-Nil, and this is Matt Upsen.
[2259.00 - 2265.00] P:1603.39 E:0.107049 |  Well, there's a little bit of a kind of look amongst the England players at the moment of kind of what's going on.
[2265.00 - 2272.00] P:1455.41 E:0.105668 |  I don't think this is going to plan in terms of how England envisage controlling this game and creating opportunities.
[2272.00 - 2277.00] P:1467.46 E:0.108882 |  They're a little bit uncertain with their passing, and I'm just looking at John Stones playing it out to Harry Maguire.
[2277.00 - 2283.00] P:1421.35 E:0.102800 |  He has a touch, he plays it to short, now we've gone forward, and there's a little flick from Foden, and this is now starting to happen.
[2283.00 - 2289.00] P:1766.29 E:0.113150 |  OK, giving it back to Ballingham. Ballingham might find some space. He pulls it back, Henderson left foot!
[2289.00 - 2296.00] P:1744.98 E:0.118892 |  England take the lead! It's Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool captain with the breakthrough for England!
[2297.00 - 2308.00] P:1740.61 E:0.115568 |  And that is a massive relief for England and Gareth Southgate, and all of these supporters in this stadium, in white and red.
[2308.00 - 2315.00] P:1768.64 E:0.114366 |  Senegal have really tested England, but Henderson strikes, and it's England one Senegal-Nil.
[2315.00 - 2320.00] P:1769.65 E:0.114918 |  Well, it's probably one of the more unlikely goal scorers, but because of his role tonight in the midfield,
[2320.00 - 2326.00] P:1737.82 E:0.123790 |  he's been getting forward and arriving in the box anytime between him and Drew Bellingham.
[2326.00 - 2332.00] P:1673.79 E:0.119818 |  But it's one of the first times that England have been really positive with their play out in the back.
[2332.00 - 2338.00] P:1669.10 E:0.124541 |  It's a brilliant flick from Foden, as the ball goes to short, it's a little touch from Foden.
[2338.00 - 2347.00] P:1579.62 E:0.122375 |  Great run from Bellingham, who gets down the side, and he pulls the ball back across, and it's Jordan Henderson arriving with his left foot.
[2347.00 - 2353.00] P:1552.91 E:0.116257 |  The two midfield players really, who have got that licence to drive forward and get into the box.
[2353.00 - 2359.00] P:1618.81 E:0.111480 |  The flick from Foden is absolutely exquisite with the outside of his left boot, just skims it straight into Bellingham,
[2359.00 - 2365.00] P:1580.75 E:0.106647 |  he knows exactly where he is, and it's a comfortable finish for Jordan Henderson with his left foot side foot,
[2365.00 - 2370.00] P:1620.78 E:0.110415 |  just punches it across the goal. Really good, really well worked, shall I say, goal from England.
[2370.00 - 2377.00] P:1467.89 E:0.110088 |  That's Matt Ubson, and a view down on Tickside from Rob Green, and obviously with the red, Rob, but I'm sure you'll have had a view.
[2377.00 - 2381.00] P:1650.02 E:0.116281 |  Yeah, and you just realise how many England fans are here when the actual goal goes in,
[2381.00 - 2388.00] P:1549.67 E:0.093878 |  because half the ground went up behind me, directly behind me, everybody went up.
[2388.00 - 2394.00] P:1521.24 E:0.107909 |  Ball into the penalty area for Senegal, taken down to the byline, but it's overrun by Gia, and it's through for a goal kick,
[2394.00 - 2396.00] P:1699.37 E:0.095184 |  and you can finish that thought, Rob.
[2396.00 - 2404.00] P:1635.78 E:0.103159 |  Yeah, but he's on the pitch, it was an emotional, real sense of relief, and you look at the reaction of the players,
[2404.00 - 2411.00] P:1609.94 E:0.100260 |  and like, finally we've got one right, there, just there, the ball being run out of play, Jordan Henderson celebrating that,
[2411.00 - 2419.00] P:1617.08 E:0.098922 |  just like he did his good, the goal, so, you know, there's all of a sudden a sense of feeling, a sense of relief about the players in the crowd.
[2419.00 - 2421.00] P:1607.64 E:0.095932 |  Just pure joy.
[2422.00 - 2430.00] P:1492.95 E:0.106711 |  England one, Senegal, 0, and England become the first team to hit 10 goals at this World Cup,
[2430.00 - 2434.00] P:1464.12 E:0.104633 |  and Jordan Henderson, memory scored in the Euro quarter-final.
[2434.00 - 2439.00] P:1499.26 E:0.104650 |  You were there, Matt, in Rome last year against Ukraine, that was his first England goal.
[2439.00 - 2440.00] P:1409.96 E:0.098052 |  Yep.
[2440.00 - 2443.00] P:1496.47 E:0.113036 |  So, knockout stages last year, knockout stages this year.
[2444.00 - 2452.00] P:1638.10 E:0.108454 |  Here is Saka on the right-hand side, across, Kane is there, but Falling hits the shot right foot, and hooked it over the top of the crossbar,
[2452.00 - 2460.00] P:1534.87 E:0.105120 |  and he's landed flat on his face, and you can tell what he's thinking, that was a chance to get his first goal at this World Cup.
[2460.00 - 2466.00] P:1497.04 E:0.103674 |  Lovely play from Saka, slowed the defender down, couple of slow touches, then shifts it onto his left foot,
[2466.00 - 2473.00] P:1423.93 E:0.107524 |  and I have to say, there's been two left foot crosses, I think one from Kane and one from Bellingham,
[2473.00 - 2480.00] P:1484.70 E:0.107946 |  that cross from Bellingham from the goal, and now that one from Saka, that's four balls gone into the box that have been so inviting from wide areas,
[2480.00 - 2486.00] P:1436.92 E:0.103607 |  and it's somewhere that England have to keep probing, because we've clearly got the ability to manufacture that space.
[2486.00 - 2491.00] P:1569.38 E:0.107293 |  Oh, that's a good pass from Kane to Saka, and Saka's left-footed ball right across the header,
[2491.00 - 2498.00] P:1657.51 E:0.106007 |  and then Fordham, who couldn't get a touch on that, perhaps if it had been Kane in that position rather than Fordham, the taller man,
[2498.00 - 2502.00] P:1615.15 E:0.097557 |  it might have ended up in the net, but it's beyond and through, goal kick.
[2502.00 - 2508.00] P:1494.51 E:0.104181 |  I don't know about you, John, but you just get this feeling that England really needed that goal, it was getting a little bit edgy, wasn't it?
[2508.00 - 2514.00] P:1450.92 E:0.105943 |  Not a lot of confidence playing out from the back, that one piece of quality, that move, it just all came together,
[2514.00 - 2522.00] P:1552.38 E:0.106513 |  and I think when the quality does all connect, we all spoke about who's favourite for the game and the quality that England have in the team.
[2522.00 - 2530.00] P:1484.33 E:0.101552 |  When you see it all come together, that's the end result, I think it's goals or it's efforts on goal, England just got to keep doing that.
[2530.00 - 2535.00] P:1433.73 E:0.096032 |  That's it, that's the story of this World Cup and England's performances so far.
[2535.00 - 2540.00] P:1436.07 E:0.098719 |  Stay in the game, work hard, which I think we've naturally got such a good work ethic about the team.
[2540.00 - 2549.00] P:1493.46 E:0.108858 |  The midfield area and wide areas, you've got players that really are fit and put a shift in, and then just those moments in games where they can capitalise.
[2549.00 - 2558.00] P:1675.06 E:0.107804 |  Given away by Coulis-Ballet, Shaw was onto that, banning him back to Shaw, Shaw from an angle, Mendy comes out and Shaw tried to cross it,
[2558.00 - 2567.00] P:1569.95 E:0.109655 |  he was running at pace, he was off balance, he tried to open his body and cross it, and Mendy, race along the dead ball line, did get a touch to block it behind for a corner.
[2567.00 - 2570.00] P:1560.78 E:0.110544 |  Well it's Luke Shaw's anticipation, brilliant to step in front and win it.
[2570.00 - 2582.00] P:1561.72 E:0.109393 |  It's just a shame his first touch takes him so wide, I think belling him slides him in, almost took to have a shot, but he just doesn't get hold of the ball and he toes it straight and the moment he does that, Mendy's out,
[2582.00 - 2588.00] P:1533.41 E:0.103077 |  and it's very difficult for him to get his head up and get the ball back across the goal, but great anticipation initially.
[2588.00 - 2594.00] P:1556.95 E:0.102027 |  South East, though, England have been working on these, and it comes to the near post, but he's headed away, didn't meet the first defender,
[2594.00 - 2601.00] P:1545.74 E:0.096083 |  Saka then puts in the challenge, two players came together, Saka's ended up on the ground, the ball's deflected into the full-back position,
[2601.00 - 2609.00] P:1579.64 E:0.099213 |  and he's cleared away towards the half-way line, where McQuire wins the head-out and advances out of play for a throw-in to England, Saka still down on the ground.
[2609.00 - 2618.00] P:1427.84 E:0.102150 |  So 1-0 England lead, but just going back to what we were saying while Saka is looked at here, he's going to get to his feet, I think he's OK.
[2618.00 - 2627.00] P:1436.56 E:0.102128 |  It's that connection, it's the connection of the play for England that simply hasn't always been there, but when it is there, it looks dangerous.
[2627.00 - 2635.00] P:1418.00 E:0.104331 |  Well it's unrealistic to expect it to happen all the time in every game, but there has to be moments of when it does connect,
[2635.00 - 2642.00] P:1440.91 E:0.102253 |  and we've just seen there the possibilities, when it does all come together and you've got players like Foden and Bellingham running forwards
[2642.00 - 2646.00] P:1451.56 E:0.103942 |  and linking up with little Flix and playing around the corner, it can be devastating.
[2646.00 - 2656.00] P:1459.96 E:0.095897 |  So 1-0 England lead, Jordan Henderson, who's now almost giddy with goals for England, having not scored one till his 62nd appearance,
[2656.00 - 2667.00] P:1503.62 E:0.094831 |  he's now got 3 in 73, going gold mad, and England passing the ball out from the back, and here is the goal scorer, Jordan Henderson,
[2667.00 - 2676.00] P:1702.08 E:0.109196 |  and then Rice takes it in his path, and Rice is taking it down the right, and his low ball into the area, straight into the path of Cooley Balli,
[2676.00 - 2678.00] P:1623.81 E:0.113713 |  he steers it behind, but it's in the corner to England.
[2678.00 - 2687.00] P:1601.04 E:0.111011 |  I mean to Bellingham, I don't know what is happening for Brechtjoppe, he's just everywhere on this pitch, and Declan Rice tries to pick out Foden,
[2687.00 - 2694.00] P:1556.59 E:0.108702 |  but really the ball probably is just slightly cut back to the penalty spot because it's that man Bellingham, who I think might have even won the ball at the start of that move,
[2694.00 - 2698.00] P:1457.62 E:0.100131 |  gets himself in the box, and he's just bouncing about all over the pitch.
[2698.00 - 2705.00] P:1571.15 E:0.094223 |  A 19 year old who set up the opening goal for Henderson, he has the corner from the right for England.
[2705.00 - 2713.00] P:1571.75 E:0.096110 |  Foden raises both arms this time, left footed delivery towards the back post, McGuire's after it, but Cooley Balli got there first,
[2713.00 - 2722.00] P:1445.57 E:0.106369 |  and the ball bounces out on the far side for a throw into England, Shaw was being watched there all the way, two minutes of added time at the end of this first half,
[2722.00 - 2727.00] P:1387.52 E:0.104865 |  but England got the crucial first goal, and relief was the word from an England point of view.
[2727.00 - 2730.00] P:1385.06 E:0.097704 |  Absolutely 100% it was relief.
[2730.00 - 2738.00] P:1433.57 E:0.101353 |  I think there's a little bit of confusion, a little bit of lack of understanding, but then it's just clicked, and I think England just needs to be solid.
[2738.00 - 2745.00] P:1456.61 E:0.097221 |  They've got to be careful when they have the ball at the back, that those passes aren't given away when they're trying to play through into the midfield,
[2745.00 - 2753.00] P:1525.57 E:0.103760 |  because it's when we're at our most vulnerable, when we stretch, and Senegal just turned the ball over, they win that ball, and they're not shy, playing a forward pass straight away,
[2753.00 - 2756.00] P:1576.22 E:0.108376 |  they don't look to keep possession, they just want to hurt England.
[2756.00 - 2764.00] P:1535.33 E:0.103582 |  Another excellent pass from Jude Bellingham, just as you were talking there, Matt, and then Bellingham has thrown himself to the ground,
[2764.00 - 2773.00] P:1435.30 E:0.103567 |  and Diagh was just to his left, to Senegal number nine, referee's come across, blown his whistle, and then just sort of waved everyone to get on with it,
[2773.00 - 2781.00] P:1463.30 E:0.104015 |  I'm not sure what exactly happened there, but Saka committed a foul actually earlier, and so it's a great kick to Senegal inside their own home.
[2781.00 - 2790.00] P:1564.09 E:0.104468 |  I think he just shoved Jude Bellingham, bubba Diagh, and a little bit of frustration, but Saka just dangled his leg out, as Jakobs I think it was,
[2790.00 - 2797.00] P:1525.77 E:0.100002 |  he was trying to go past him, it was a clear foul, and the referee just gave that foul, and just tried to just settle everything down.
[2798.00 - 2807.00] P:1448.93 E:0.096607 |  Well, the goal has settled England, certainly. The first goal, it felt it was going to be very important, but this match is still on an off edge,
[2807.00 - 2811.00] P:1504.21 E:0.088226 |  and Senegal have already demonstrated that there can be a danger.
[2811.00 - 2820.00] P:1421.72 E:0.094678 |  As Long Pass has hit for Senegal, down into the England right back area, but Walker is able to head that away, but it comes back at the England defence,
[2820.00 - 2830.00] P:1456.73 E:0.095753 |  and Diagh is able to pull it down and use Ismail Asar, and now Jakobs, Jakobs away from Saka,
[2830.00 - 2841.00] P:1656.22 E:0.104152 |  and Diagh's cross took a flick off Walker, but that took it back outside the box, but Patecis was beaten to it, and now Bellingham glides forward again,
[2841.00 - 2852.00] P:1735.74 E:0.116560 |  brilliant play up to Foden, back to Kane, right for Jack, down to England, super move, Bellingham at the heart of it,
[2852.00 - 2864.00] P:1746.29 E:0.114068 |  Foden then provided it, and Harry Kane scored it, his first goal at this World Cup. It had been coming, now it's arrived for the England captain,
[2864.00 - 2868.00] P:1651.68 E:0.111501 |  and England leads Senegal by two goals to nil.
[2868.00 - 2879.00] P:1645.19 E:0.114811 |  What a goal from England. I mean, there's so many positives about that move, because out of possession, England was set brilliantly for the counterattack,
[2879.00 - 2887.00] P:1522.82 E:0.130858 |  but you have to just talk about this guy, Drew Bellingham. I mean, I just can't tell you the impact he's had on this game,
[2887.00 - 2893.00] P:1451.22 E:0.132152 |  and his body language and presence in the middle of the park, he wins the ball off of a bit of a loose touch,
[2893.00 - 2901.00] P:1420.29 E:0.123824 |  but he's got so much to do in order to make this chance happen. He touches it past the Senegalese player, he then shrugs him off,
[2901.00 - 2908.00] P:1456.72 E:0.125964 |  he uses his pace and his range of running to get the other side of him, he has another touch, and then he's got the calmness to get his head up,
[2908.00 - 2917.00] P:1512.64 E:0.118339 |  he sees the pass, lays it off, it's one touch into the path of Kane, and he does not disappoint, because let me tell you, that chance isn't easy, John.
[2917.00 - 2927.00] P:1471.64 E:0.117845 |  He's got a lot of time to think here, Harry Kane. He hasn't scored yet in this tournament, he has to settle himself, his composure is absolutely ice cold,
[2927.00 - 2934.00] P:1468.83 E:0.124883 |  and he's banged it with his right foot across the goal into the bottom corner. Fabulous goal from England.
[2935.00 - 2943.00] P:1450.77 E:0.118805 |  That goal was absolutely buried by the England captain on his right foot, and that was the last action of the first half.
[2943.00 - 2957.00] P:1577.07 E:0.104115 |  That goal from Harry Kane is his 52nd for England, he's now won behind Wayne Rooney, and he has now scored his 11th goal at either a World Cup or a European Championship Finals tournament,
[2957.00 - 2962.00] P:1523.27 E:0.098201 |  and that is a record for England, he moves ahead of Gary Lineker.
[2962.00 - 2970.00] P:1868.91 E:0.089483 |  And England are in charge, there were some awkward, difficult moments, but at half time, two of the experienced heads have got the goals,
[2970.00 - 2974.00] P:1702.67 E:0.091071 |  Henderson and Kane, and it's England 2, Senegal 0.
[2975.00 - 2983.00] P:1694.61 E:0.099173 |  But Maddox and then we've got Rob Green on the touchline, and Michael Richards is with us as well, the experienced heads have got the goal,
[2983.00 - 2986.00] P:1686.95 E:0.093274 |  but that half is all about Jude Bellingham.
[2986.00 - 2995.00] P:1688.85 E:0.091359 |  He's a masterclass, isn't it, in midfield play, I mean, referred to him a couple of times during the game, but I could have just done play a cap,
[2995.00 - 3003.00] P:1760.91 E:0.096802 |  for a moment there, I was just doing play a cap, I just wanted to watch him, the energy is body language, the way he's springing about the pitch,
[3003.00 - 3012.00] P:1681.78 E:0.098501 |  his hands up in the air waving, give me the ball, give me the ball, but it's like watching an excited, excited kid on a park, isn't it,
[3012.00 - 3021.00] P:1777.11 E:0.097786 |  the way he's playing with the freedom, the expression, the energy, I can't talk highly enough of it, and it's what you want to see in these high pressure games,
[3021.00 - 3029.00] P:1712.17 E:0.088818 |  to have somebody with that mentality, to have the ball and want to drive, and just looks like he's enjoying football, that's Jude Bellingham.
[3029.00 - 3035.00] P:1742.94 E:0.091062 |  He's 19, he's 19 years of age, to put in a performance like that is just incredible.
[3035.00 - 3045.00] P:1763.65 E:0.091640 |  When the game was flat and Senegal was causing his real problems, just when he needed someone to grab the game by the scruff of his neck,
[3045.00 - 3052.00] P:1648.24 E:0.098083 |  Bellingham was there, whether it was defending, whether it was tacking, whether it was passing, I mean, I like how aggressive he is as well.
[3052.00 - 3059.00] P:1730.18 E:0.093103 |  You know these Senegalese teams, he's strong and it's fast, and he's going up against them, what a performance it was.
[3059.00 - 3068.00] P:1711.36 E:0.097054 |  It's so wiry, isn't it? You don't think he's going to get past the player, but he's got this stride length, that once he touches it past someone,
[3068.00 - 3076.00] P:1892.94 E:0.094385 |  it's technically so good, he shifts to the side, he gets his arm across and then these legs, and it's just his stride pattern's massive, and he just blows people away.
[3076.00 - 3078.00] P:1965.33 E:0.110434 |  It's decision making as well.
[3078.00 - 3079.00] P:1890.18 E:0.100467 |  Decisive of it.
[3079.00 - 3084.00] P:1964.67 E:0.101584 |  You know, when you get into an area, how many times have we heard of young players, when you're getting into an area, it just needs to relax,
[3084.00 - 3091.00] P:1965.69 E:0.095856 |  he's the calm down, that part of his game will come. He's got it already at 19, it is breathtaking.
[3091.00 - 3100.00] P:1957.61 E:0.094415 |  His body language, Rob Greed, in your pit side, his body language from the very first whistle was basically bring this on.
[3100.00 - 3107.00] P:1726.20 E:0.092559 |  I mean, his celebration when Henderson put the ball in the net was not far off to headbutt Henderson, in that celebration.
[3107.00 - 3118.00] P:1753.79 E:0.091560 |  I mean, they did go head to head, congratulating each other. As they walked back having congratulated Harry Kane, he's gesturing to the crowd to keep them off.
[3118.00 - 3126.00] P:1903.39 E:0.082761 |  It has been an incredible performance, and so much so that you talk about body language and the way someone carries themselves.
[3126.00 - 3135.00] P:1825.94 E:0.081216 |  The way that Senegal got about the game has been really impressive, but then he gets the ball, and I don't think they have an answer for him.
[3135.00 - 3144.00] P:1864.71 E:0.082394 |  There, with that second goal, they tried to wipe him out, they tried to clean him out in the centre circle because they knew, they knew what was coming, and they just bounced off him.
[3144.00 - 3156.00] P:1955.76 E:0.077496 |  As a kid, you don't fully grow as a male to what your brain doesn't deform to your about 50, but your body is not about 25, 26, but he's nice.
[3156.00 - 3161.00] P:1853.40 E:0.075199 |  People are bouncing off him, professional athletes are bouncing off him. It was brilliant to watch.
[3161.00 - 3171.00] P:1959.61 E:0.093696 |  I think with that first goal, there was this real sense of relief. The second one, just a sense of anticipation when the ball got to Harry Kane was brilliant.
[3171.00 - 3181.00] P:1849.89 E:0.084696 |  Everybody on the England bench was up. Everybody around the ground was waiting, going, this is it. He's going to get his goal. He didn't disappoint. Everyone went up.
[3181.00 - 3190.00] P:1799.77 E:0.090490 |  You were behind Jordan Pickford's goal for that first 45 minutes. Senegal's tactics appeared to be spot on for so much of that half.
[3190.00 - 3196.00] P:1736.43 E:0.080750 |  Wait, wait, and then basically when the ball went to Maguire, then they pressed.
[3196.00 - 3209.00] P:1781.97 E:0.085314 |  I just wonder from what you saw there how Pickford or the England defence tried to calm that down because there were some shaky moments, and that's down to how Senegal tactically set themselves up.
[3209.00 - 3222.00] P:1938.46 E:0.096155 |  They did it really, really well initially. They did it well for 20 minutes, 25 minutes, and you were wondering how long they could do it for because it took real concerted energy as a group, and they all had to go.
[3222.00 - 3230.00] P:1835.20 E:0.091803 |  And it was interesting when we did get it right with that first goal, it was down that side. Maguire gets the ball, passes it out to Schott, and that was the trigger.
[3230.00 - 3238.00] P:1819.11 E:0.087043 |  And they all pressed sideways as well as up. And they're saying, they're gambling. They're saying, look, we back ourselves to get this right against you.
[3238.00 - 3245.00] P:1916.65 E:0.085781 |  And England managed to finally get it right through them for that first goal. But it was interesting.
[3245.00 - 3251.00] P:1925.47 E:0.089720 |  I think that John Stones, Carl Walker and Pickford realised it before Maguire realised it.
[3251.00 - 3255.00] P:1877.08 E:0.086842 |  And he was getting the ball and thinking, what am I doing here?
[3255.00 - 3261.00] P:1838.97 E:0.096117 |  Whereas the rest of the players were seeing what the Senegalese players were doing, and we're thinking, no, no, no, no, come out, come out.
[3261.00 - 3265.00] P:1884.11 E:0.081366 |  By that time, it was too late. Eventually, they got it right.
[3265.00 - 3274.00] P:1987.72 E:0.090293 |  I mean, it was worrying me a little bit how if Harry Maguire got isolated out in that side, we saw it with Indeed go all the way around him.
[3274.00 - 3278.00] P:1840.34 E:0.097847 |  He just didn't look like he quite had the reaction time when he was isolated with space around him.
[3278.00 - 3285.00] P:1765.76 E:0.091409 |  We know that a little bit about Harry Maguire anyway. And I think if the back falls right and it's identified, can support that.
[3285.00 - 3291.00] P:1714.20 E:0.092685 |  And he can still have a very good performance in the game. But with the ball, we have to be careful.
[3291.00 - 3298.00] P:1838.52 E:0.091991 |  And it's just the quality. I mean, it hasn't been a brilliant England performance in that first half in terms of you look at the 45 minutes globally.
[3298.00 - 3304.00] P:1918.81 E:0.088166 |  It's not been that great. We've just had moments. And I'm just looking at the replay of the first goal.
[3304.00 - 3312.00] P:1885.23 E:0.086965 |  Jude Bellingham. I mean, there's four players, four Senegalese players between him and Jordan Henderson, and he picks him out with his left foot.
[3312.00 - 3322.00] P:1869.08 E:0.082503 |  Absolutely inch perfect the delivery of the cross. So there's just been a couple of moments of super quality that's basically decided this game.
[3322.00 - 3330.00] P:1719.56 E:0.097191 |  Well, we said that though, didn't we? Before the game, I think looking at the teams, we said it be Keiji, we said it be Tent.
[3330.00 - 3337.00] P:1788.29 E:0.097945 |  But all in all, the quality is shown. When they move the ball quick, they get in the results and that's what I need to keep doing.
[3337.00 - 3343.00] P:1758.52 E:0.097812 |  I think it was lucky at times. You know, they had a couple of chances Senegal, if that goes in, the game could have changed.
[3343.00 - 3351.00] P:1847.60 E:0.092160 |  But it's just about patience. And I think in credit to England, they could have folded, but they didn't. They stood up to it.
[3351.00 - 3361.00] P:1799.95 E:0.084535 |  They've got the right moments, the moments right in the game that they needed to. And they've got the two goals and I can't be happy enough for them.
[3361.00 - 3365.00] P:1650.05 E:0.102239 |  Her, Micah, Matt, Rob for the moment. Thank you very much.

[3548.00 - 3549.00] P:1580.81 E:0.086085 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[3549.00 - 3552.00] P:1515.67 E:0.088011 |  I think that's the way that the dressing room wanted to be.
[3552.00 - 3555.00] P:984.94 E:0.100272 |  Ben's always said, and Baz has always said,
[3555.00 - 3559.00] P:1104.97 E:0.105779 |  that we want to put ourselves in positions to win test matches.
[3559.00 - 3563.00] P:1353.97 E:0.101404 |  It has been a pretty door-to-out pitch in the first four days.
[3563.00 - 3566.00] P:1397.88 E:0.097247 |  And we've got ourselves...
[3566.00 - 3569.00] P:1332.38 E:0.101586 |  The way that we play the game, you can get yourself in position.
[3569.00 - 3573.00] P:1180.06 E:0.089285 |  We buy ourselves time, the way that we play with the bat.
[3573.00 - 3576.00] P:1112.29 E:0.101928 |  And hopefully we're giving ourselves enough time.
[3576.00 - 3580.00] P:1594.10 E:0.091194 |  Even with all those hours that we've lost during the test match with Badlite,
[3580.00 - 3583.00] P:1173.96 E:0.099177 |  hopefully we're giving ourselves enough time to win the game tomorrow.
[3583.00 - 3585.00] P:1128.37 E:0.088233 |  Ben Stokes said before the game,
[3585.00 - 3590.00] P:1039.14 E:0.089000 |  and Baz McCullum as well said, we're prepared to win the game.
[3590.00 - 3595.00] P:1413.39 E:0.098875 |  How disappointed would it be to lose the game when you score 650 in the first innings?
[3595.00 - 3598.00] P:1490.98 E:0.095630 |  Well, it wouldn't be. I think that's the whole point of it.
[3598.00 - 3605.00] P:1250.01 E:0.096762 |  Obviously we always want to win, and obviously when you lose games, it is disappointing.
[3605.00 - 3610.00] P:1223.35 E:0.096940 |  But as long as you've played in the right brand of crickets and played in the right way,
[3610.00 - 3613.00] P:1180.35 E:0.102584 |  and given yourself an opportunity to win the game,
[3613.00 - 3616.00] P:1166.91 E:0.099125 |  and given yourself enough time to win the game,
[3616.00 - 3619.00] P:1316.15 E:0.119777 |  then there's no shame in losing.
[3619.00 - 3624.00] P:1168.23 E:0.105160 |  There has always to be a winner and a loser in test crickets.
[3624.00 - 3629.00] P:1203.77 E:0.098721 |  And as a bigger pitcher, Baz always, and Stokes,
[3629.00 - 3632.00] P:1217.59 E:0.110578 |  he wants to make test cricket a lot more exciting.
[3632.00 - 3635.00] P:1112.43 E:0.109173 |  We want to bring the crowds back in the future.
[3635.00 - 3639.00] P:1217.42 E:0.107470 |  And this is another example of making a bold declaration
[3639.00 - 3642.00] P:1626.86 E:0.106692 |  to actually make the game a lot more exciting.
[3642.00 - 3645.00] P:1287.80 E:0.105590 |  One final thing. I know your focus is on this game,
[3645.00 - 3647.00] P:1143.98 E:0.109782 |  but there's a big football match tonight.
[3647.00 - 3649.00] P:1054.90 E:0.107792 |  It kicks off at midnight.
[3649.00 - 3653.00] P:1501.57 E:0.104537 |  You as the coaching staff, are the players that are going to be allowed to watch it?
[3653.00 - 3655.00] P:1420.08 E:0.099779 |  I'll be watching, yeah, definitely. 100%.
[3655.00 - 3658.00] P:1348.87 E:0.115252 |  It's only midnight. You only need a couple of hours of sleep, don't you?
[3658.00 - 3660.00] P:1409.77 E:0.104530 |  So, no, I'm looking forward to it.
[3660.00 - 3666.00] P:1052.33 E:0.104346 |  If we can get through to the quarters and further, it's going to be exciting.
[3666.00 - 3669.00] P:1523.87 E:0.119992 |  Are the players going to be watching it with a big day ahead tomorrow?
[3669.00 - 3671.00] P:1391.74 E:0.113759 |  I can imagine.
[3671.00 - 3673.00] P:1349.27 E:0.115716 |  Well, a few of them are going to be pretty tired, to be honest.
[3673.00 - 3678.00] P:1235.05 E:0.106930 |  So, if they can stay up that long, they'll have it on, definitely.
[3678.00 - 3681.00] P:2054.35 E:0.072491 |  In good coach, Paul Collingwood,
[3681.00 - 3686.00] P:2023.40 E:0.088308 |  that covers regimes 4-40 tomorrow morning on Sports Extra.
[3686.00 - 3689.00] P:1781.50 E:0.096301 |  Obviously, the winners here are going to take on France in the quarterfinals.
[3689.00 - 3691.00] P:1948.29 E:0.096256 |  They beat Poland 3-1.
[3691.00 - 3694.00] P:1939.21 E:0.100150 |  Olivier Giroud got one of the goals in doing so.
[3694.00 - 3696.00] P:2014.83 E:0.082312 |  Breed the French goal-scoring record.
[3696.00 - 3698.00] P:1992.90 E:0.093221 |  Here's his captain, Hugo Lloris.
[3698.00 - 3700.00] P:1647.00 E:0.085722 |  Very good night. A great feeling.
[3700.00 - 3706.00] P:1627.31 E:0.090556 |  First of all, for the team, because we're going to have an opportunity to play a quarterfinal of World Cup.
[3706.00 - 3708.00] P:1515.68 E:0.097267 |  And it's a great feeling.
[3708.00 - 3716.00] P:1634.12 E:0.096174 |  And then, yes, there is a generation of players that are playing for a while now for the French national team.
[3716.00 - 3722.00] P:1517.59 E:0.092011 |  And I'm so happy for Olivier to break the number of goals record.
[3722.00 - 3728.00] P:1700.38 E:0.093248 |  It's just an amazing feeling to live this experience, to share this experience altogether.
[3728.00 - 3734.00] P:1560.20 E:0.095902 |  And, you know, at this stage of the competition, now we don't want to put limit, you know?
[3734.00 - 3737.00] P:1721.36 E:0.066153 |  We want to continue as far as we can.
[3737.00 - 3740.00] P:1909.24 E:0.088275 |  That was Kylian.
[3740.00 - 3744.00] P:1905.30 E:0.092272 |  That was Hugo Lloris on Olivier Giroud breaking the goal-scoring record for France.
[3744.00 - 3746.00] P:1917.05 E:0.080236 |  The other two goals came from Kylian Mbappe.
[3746.00 - 3754.00] P:1910.28 E:0.093036 |  Meanwhile, Brazilian head coach Tite says Neymar will be available for their last 16 game against South Korea tomorrow.
[3754.00 - 3763.00] P:1785.44 E:0.090023 |  He sustained ligament damage in the first game against Serbia, England on their way back out here.
[3763.00 - 3768.00] P:1700.40 E:0.105345 |  Jub Bellingham, the youngest player to assist in a World Cup game for England since 1966.
[3768.00 - 3779.00] P:1723.76 E:0.092484 |  And Jordan Henderson tonight has become the second oldest ever World Cup goal scorer after Tom Finney against the USSR in 1958.
[3779.00 - 3783.00] P:1540.96 E:0.098099 |  And with his memories of that goal, John Murray.
[3783.00 - 3785.00] P:1375.45 E:0.118001 |  Yes, I remember.
[3785.00 - 3787.00] P:1561.63 E:0.114281 |  Happy birthday, by the way.
[3787.00 - 3789.00] P:1503.99 E:0.101691 |  That's very kind of you.
[3789.00 - 3794.00] P:1424.86 E:0.107281 |  Yes, I did something this morning that I've never done before as well.
[3794.00 - 3800.00] P:1567.57 E:0.114208 |  I tweaked a hamstring on the morning of my 56th birthday.
[3800.00 - 3801.00] P:1513.16 E:0.119719 |  Wow.
[3801.00 - 3802.00] P:1503.24 E:0.096188 |  Were you running?
[3802.00 - 3803.00] P:1385.95 E:0.117725 |  Yeah, I was.
[3803.00 - 3804.00] P:1354.02 E:0.120003 |  Too fast.
[3804.00 - 3806.00] P:1454.06 E:0.133400 |  Downhill all the way from there.
[3806.00 - 3808.00] P:1511.22 E:0.102705 |  That is very much so.
[3808.00 - 3812.00] P:1631.72 E:0.097236 |  However, for England, there at the top of the tree, 2-0 up.
[3812.00 - 3816.00] P:1672.48 E:0.092177 |  Senegal have made a triple substitution.
[3816.00 - 3820.00] P:1462.82 E:0.100742 |  So I think that tells you what Aliyu Cisi is thinking down there.
[3820.00 - 3824.00] P:1568.55 E:0.090169 |  It had to be rapid action for him. 2-0 down.
[3824.00 - 3827.00] P:1584.01 E:0.093884 |  Can you see anywhere back that, Upson?
[3827.00 - 3832.00] P:1510.36 E:0.097176 |  I think it's a bit early to say that the game's dead in Berry,
[3832.00 - 3837.00] P:1517.72 E:0.095042 |  but there's got to be a massive turn about how Senegal are going to create
[3837.00 - 3840.00] P:1497.54 E:0.099168 |  enough chances to score 2 goals in that game.
[3840.00 - 3842.00] P:1514.24 E:0.110206 |  They looked a threat at times in the first half,
[3842.00 - 3845.00] P:1389.59 E:0.112211 |  but a lot of that was down to maybe us giving the ball away
[3845.00 - 3847.00] P:1433.52 E:0.111926 |  and being a little bit sloppy.
[3847.00 - 3851.00] P:1404.68 E:0.108664 |  So if England are very professional, very confident in this second half,
[3851.00 - 3855.00] P:1376.70 E:0.107437 |  I think they've got a real uphill task to get back in this game.
[3855.00 - 3859.00] P:1441.33 E:0.109343 |  Well, no changes for England who lead through those goals from Henderson and Cain.
[3859.00 - 3864.00] P:1479.12 E:0.096563 |  England with Pickford in goal, Walker, Stones, McGuire and Shaw at the back four,
[3864.00 - 3866.00] P:1570.35 E:0.093643 |  Wright Henderson in Bellingham in the middle,
[3866.00 - 3868.00] P:1440.20 E:0.100281 |  Sacher on the right, Foden on the left,
[3868.00 - 3870.00] P:1466.32 E:0.100191 |  and Harry Cain through the middle as I say.
[3870.00 - 3872.00] P:1559.83 E:0.105971 |  Now, 52 goals for England,
[3872.00 - 3878.00] P:1516.93 E:0.090058 |  so he has won behind Wayne Rooney's record for the England men's team.
[3878.00 - 3881.00] P:1464.25 E:0.100969 |  And Senegal making three changes.
[3881.00 - 3884.00] P:1559.46 E:0.096528 |  So Crepeg Diata has been substituted,
[3884.00 - 3887.00] P:1571.95 E:0.100237 |  so has Pappasis from the midfield,
[3887.00 - 3892.00] P:1577.59 E:0.092720 |  and Ilamane and Dai is off as well, the Sheffield United man.
[3892.00 - 3899.00] P:1582.92 E:0.091830 |  And the three to come on are Bamba Dieng and also Papp Gay.
[3899.00 - 3905.00] P:1578.56 E:0.092618 |  And Pappsar of Tottenham has come on as well,
[3905.00 - 3908.00] P:1620.30 E:0.094485 |  who has not yet played for Tottenham in a competitive match,
[3908.00 - 3912.00] P:1541.09 E:0.102072 |  the 20-year-old who was very highly thought of by Tottenham,
[3912.00 - 3915.00] P:1475.09 E:0.093879 |  but yet to play, but he comes on tonight,
[3915.00 - 3919.00] P:1431.37 E:0.095750 |  the number 17 to win his 12th-clap cap for Senegal.
[3919.00 - 3922.00] P:1510.96 E:0.085550 |  Big prospect, I think, John.
[3922.00 - 3925.00] P:1512.31 E:0.109235 |  He's been on loan as he had met a couple of times,
[3925.00 - 3930.00] P:1432.98 E:0.106211 |  so he hasn't been at Spurs much, but highly rated 20-year-old.
[3930.00 - 3933.00] P:1319.44 E:0.097887 |  See what he can do, great opportunity for him.
[3933.00 - 3938.00] P:1334.01 E:0.106762 |  He's on the same field as his Tottenham team-mate Harry Cain.
[3938.00 - 3942.00] P:1384.72 E:0.098353 |  So England with the ball at the back, and here is John Stones.
[3942.00 - 3945.00] P:1461.48 E:0.106574 |  And that second goal, it was right before halftime,
[3945.00 - 3948.00] P:1419.40 E:0.099050 |  and Bellingham there, and just see that unit again.
[3948.00 - 3952.00] P:1471.74 E:0.105898 |  Boulay-Giat is having a little nibble at him, the ball had gone,
[3952.00 - 3956.00] P:1652.82 E:0.105065 |  but here's Saka, and now Henderson, Henderson clips it across,
[3956.00 - 3959.00] P:1556.16 E:0.107811 |  and it's cleared away on the edge of the six-yard box by Coulou-Ballet.
[3959.00 - 3962.00] P:1465.93 E:0.101961 |  There were players arriving in white, but he couldn't pick them out, Henderson.
[3962.00 - 3967.00] P:1386.65 E:0.104197 |  No, but I'm just loving the way that Henderson and Bellingham are both arriving
[3967.00 - 3970.00] P:1486.99 E:0.100266 |  in wide areas, which is crossing positions,
[3970.00 - 3974.00] P:1578.61 E:0.105714 |  so they're making themselves available to run wide of the 18-yard box,
[3974.00 - 3977.00] P:1498.31 E:0.108189 |  but also getting in the box. This is Bellingham on the left-hand side now.
[3977.00 - 3980.00] P:1347.17 E:0.105913 |  Well, he's put up on the left now, he's into the penalty area,
[3980.00 - 3984.00] P:1507.74 E:0.103019 |  but he just couldn't get past Sabaley, who was able to block it away,
[3984.00 - 3987.00] P:1429.27 E:0.103871 |  and the referee's sputtering the infringement by Bellingham on him.
[3987.00 - 3990.00] P:1519.62 E:0.106249 |  A little bit of a flip-flap, wasn't it, from Bellingham,
[3990.00 - 3993.00] P:1501.76 E:0.102677 |  just dragging the ball with the same foot, just trying to flick it,
[3993.00 - 3995.00] P:1522.32 E:0.101142 |  and almost not make the opposition.
[3995.00 - 3997.00] P:1532.87 E:0.101523 |  That's where he's at, and he's there.
[3997.00 - 3999.00] P:1521.21 E:0.097468 |  That's the confidence who's in out of this, lad.
[4000.00 - 4004.00] P:1459.10 E:0.099575 |  So that's Matt Upsen, another England World Cup man.
[4004.00 - 4009.00] P:1507.00 E:0.094859 |  Rob Green is down on the touchline behind the goal,
[4009.00 - 4014.00] P:1528.95 E:0.092899 |  so Rob will be watching England attack towards him in the second half.
[4014.00 - 4020.00] P:1467.32 E:0.102311 |  And still, we hear that brilliant noise coming out of the several hundred Senegal fans,
[4020.00 - 4025.00] P:1407.12 E:0.098785 |  who have not been affected in the slightest by the fact that their team have conceded those two goals.
[4025.00 - 4028.00] P:1522.78 E:0.102442 |  England win it back. He has came in the centre-circle, finds Bellingham.
[4028.00 - 4032.00] P:1652.96 E:0.105897 |  Bellingham now is actually shrugged off the ball by Coulou Ballet,
[4032.00 - 4036.00] P:1655.85 E:0.103074 |  and he's had some great victories tonight, but he lost out to Coulou Ballet there.
[4036.00 - 4038.00] P:1660.94 E:0.102782 |  He did Coulou Ballet, he was just too strong for him.
[4038.00 - 4042.00] P:1575.17 E:0.104330 |  I think he anticipated it really early, and he got his big frame across due to Bellingham.
[4042.00 - 4047.00] P:1480.93 E:0.103420 |  The moment he stepped across him, there's not many people that are going to shrug Coulou Ballet off.
[4048.00 - 4054.00] P:1454.05 E:0.100150 |  So two-nil England lead, and we're looking at England against France in this stadium on Saturday night,
[4054.00 - 4057.00] P:1699.87 E:0.104323 |  but Senegal aren't finished yet, crossed from the right-hand side.
[4057.00 - 4062.00] P:1620.50 E:0.105931 |  Actually, it lands at the feet of the newly-arrived Papsar of Tottenham,
[4062.00 - 4067.00] P:1445.96 E:0.103552 |  who hit a bouncing shot, missed, hit it, and pulled it well-wai'd from what, 22 yards?
[4067.00 - 4071.00] P:1564.26 E:0.103762 |  Yeah, it was a good reaction from Saka, who's wired out on the right-hand side of the pitch,
[4071.00 - 4074.00] P:1555.66 E:0.098154 |  because there's quite a big hole on the edge of the box.
[4074.00 - 4078.00] P:1422.79 E:0.103276 |  Senegal work it well to the wide area, the cross comes in a slight deflection,
[4078.00 - 4084.00] P:1276.07 E:0.096786 |  but I think Saka has just arrived in and puts Papsar off,
[4084.00 - 4087.00] P:1470.57 E:0.106250 |  so he just drags his left foot shot and pulls it wide.
[4089.00 - 4095.00] P:1548.00 E:0.102012 |  So England take the goal kick out from the back, and Luxor is able to take it down.
[4095.00 - 4098.00] P:1505.07 E:0.103173 |  So Senegal have made three substitutions.
[4098.00 - 4107.00] P:1262.26 E:0.099268 |  Gareth Southgate, you would think would certainly make changes during the course of this second half,
[4107.00 - 4111.00] P:1334.34 E:0.101552 |  but absolutely certainly if England were able to get a third goal.
[4111.00 - 4116.00] P:1251.22 E:0.099595 |  But we have that scenario now whereby the next goal is all important in this.
[4116.00 - 4119.00] P:1370.78 E:0.091287 |  If England score it, that has to be game over.
[4119.00 - 4123.00] P:1560.67 E:0.098569 |  Walker down the right, tried to play it round the one-sided jack-ups,
[4123.00 - 4125.00] P:1318.67 E:0.108104 |  but he was able to recover and put the ball out of play
[4125.00 - 4129.00] P:1233.03 E:0.100874 |  for a throw into England, level with the edge of the Senegal penalty area.
[4129.00 - 4133.00] P:1250.64 E:0.101217 |  So Saka takes the throw back to Henderson, and then Rice,
[4133.00 - 4136.00] P:1334.62 E:0.104097 |  low and through the middle to Harry Kane, who comes deep,
[4136.00 - 4141.00] P:1529.25 E:0.102692 |  and then very nearly found the pass through to Saka, through the inside right position.
[4141.00 - 4143.00] P:1313.32 E:0.098531 |  It was just intercepted on the edge of the box.
[4143.00 - 4145.00] P:1428.44 E:0.103058 |  He had to see that jack-ups didn't need the left back.
[4145.00 - 4149.00] P:1516.25 E:0.104833 |  If he had just stayed out wide, Kane had the confidence to have his first touch.
[4149.00 - 4153.00] P:1425.02 E:0.109301 |  He didn't feel the defender come all the way with him and just turned on the ball quickly.
[4153.00 - 4157.00] P:1452.90 E:0.102682 |  There aren't many better than Harry Kane at finding these passes.
[4157.00 - 4161.00] P:1450.51 E:0.107511 |  He's so creative, by the way, just slides the ball in the path of the wide plays,
[4161.00 - 4166.00] P:1427.59 E:0.098665 |  and it was good anticipation from Jack-ups just to step inside and cut that pass out.
[4166.00 - 4169.00] P:1368.75 E:0.102104 |  We've got a 6-0-6 tonight, by the way.
[4169.00 - 4172.00] P:1526.36 E:0.092291 |  Robbie Satterjian, Chris Sutton will be taking your calls.
[4172.00 - 4177.00] P:1497.78 E:0.098087 |  You can get in touch. Hashtag BBC 6-0-6, five-live sport on air till 10 o'clock tonight.
[4177.00 - 4181.00] P:1446.26 E:0.098503 |  Every match at this World Cup live on five live and BBC sounds.
[4181.00 - 4184.00] P:1420.47 E:0.108377 |  And the highlights, you might want to see them tonight.
[4184.00 - 4190.00] P:1442.09 E:0.099113 |  They're on BBC One after the news, and look out for, well, certainly Jude Bellingham's performance.
[4190.00 - 4194.00] P:1375.49 E:0.096233 |  I think they'll be purring about that in the analysis tonight,
[4194.00 - 4197.00] P:1408.36 E:0.098196 |  but also the way that Harry Kane burries that shot.
[4197.00 - 4202.00] P:1504.15 E:0.097686 |  Yeah, I mean, it sounds like you were purring on that run earlier, John, if you've done your hamming.
[4202.00 - 4204.00] P:1392.06 E:0.096490 |  I mean, don't you have to be running fast?
[4204.00 - 4206.00] P:1261.49 E:0.098526 |  Well, yeah.
[4206.00 - 4209.00] P:1586.53 E:0.104513 |  I won't be running fast for a few weeks. I know that much.
[4209.00 - 4213.00] P:1465.81 E:0.092520 |  Here, Shaw takes the throw, gives it to Bellingham, and then Foldham.
[4213.00 - 4214.00] P:1672.49 E:0.110135 |  Shaw allows it to run.
[4214.00 - 4217.00] P:1553.09 E:0.101822 |  Kane gives it back to Shaw inside the pots.
[4217.00 - 4222.00] P:1508.70 E:0.093600 |  Then Bellingham takes all that, and Bellingham now, two players around him, from foot to foot.
[4222.00 - 4225.00] P:1596.02 E:0.104163 |  It's only half cleared. Comes out to Kane, referee very nearly gets in the way.
[4225.00 - 4227.00] P:1522.35 E:0.094332 |  Kane then works it back centrally.
[4227.00 - 4230.00] P:1472.38 E:0.102780 |  Rice now out to the right-hand side to Walker.
[4230.00 - 4235.00] P:1530.44 E:0.095000 |  Even look, when they're on it, they look very slick.
[4235.00 - 4236.00] P:1584.72 E:0.073210 |  It's different, isn't it, John?
[4236.00 - 4238.00] P:1399.21 E:0.107406 |  There's a threat from so many areas.
[4238.00 - 4244.00] P:1534.34 E:0.097370 |  Yeah, the confidence, the two-goal cushion, and the belief, whether or not there was just a little bit of doubt at the start of this game,
[4244.00 - 4250.00] P:1422.09 E:0.101456 |  but the start of the second half, England's supremely confident in having the ball and the movement off it.
[4250.00 - 4255.00] P:1448.52 E:0.101326 |  It's absolutely excellent. Senegal really struggling to block all the holes.
[4255.00 - 4261.00] P:1540.02 E:0.099486 |  Kane was put under pressure from Dieng, and the ball ran away, but too far away from Dieng,
[4261.00 - 4265.00] P:1422.15 E:0.091428 |  and there was cover there, and it was played back to Pickford.
[4265.00 - 4270.00] P:1355.09 E:0.099651 |  Incidentally, seven of this team have started all four matches.
[4270.00 - 4274.00] P:1433.24 E:0.093255 |  Pickford, Shaw, Rice, Stones, Maguire, Kane and Bellingham.
[4274.00 - 4279.00] P:1543.74 E:0.096849 |  That's your call, and here is Forden, who might well be part of the call
[4279.00 - 4283.00] P:1673.89 E:0.097275 |  after they've played the ball through the goalkeeper.
[4283.00 - 4287.00] P:1638.78 E:0.103292 |  I just saw John Stones just stretch his hamstring there for a moment after that little sprint across,
[4287.00 - 4291.00] P:1364.67 E:0.108553 |  because Maguire was really quite sloppy with the ball and got caught on the ball,
[4291.00 - 4295.00] P:1476.66 E:0.095517 |  and he had to really put the power down to get across and deal with it,
[4295.00 - 4298.00] P:1628.12 E:0.104859 |  and he just bent down and stretched his hamstring a little bit, Stones.
[4299.00 - 4306.00] P:1529.86 E:0.095351 |  Now that is a worry. John Stones, one of that call, and so comfortable together.
[4306.00 - 4312.00] P:1496.82 E:0.101383 |  In England, we'll be monitoring that very carefully, although I don't see any imminent sign.
[4312.00 - 4313.00] P:1662.59 E:0.103444 |  No.
[4313.00 - 4317.00] P:1530.50 E:0.102122 |  Garra Southgate is not on the edge of the coaching area, and he just steps now
[4317.00 - 4322.00] P:1401.85 E:0.099255 |  from underneath the roof of the dugout, with England written across it in those block capitals,
[4322.00 - 4325.00] P:1461.09 E:0.106042 |  as Rice wins the ball back in centrefield.
[4325.00 - 4330.00] P:1689.43 E:0.102464 |  Here's Harry Kane, Kane for the Saka. Saka takes it wide, the shoot's from the angle,
[4330.00 - 4335.00] P:1503.45 E:0.100399 |  well wide, and it's behind, and it's a goal kick, and let's go down pitchside to Rob Green again.
[4335.00 - 4339.00] P:1464.20 E:0.112139 |  Yes, John, it's a real different feeling to the start of the second half,
[4339.00 - 4342.00] P:1505.61 E:0.111808 |  in and around the ground as well, down pitchside.
[4342.00 - 4347.00] P:1701.55 E:0.105062 |  It feels like the Jephthys gone out of it a bit, the belief of Senegal's gone out of it a bit.
[4347.00 - 4351.00] P:1709.43 E:0.103099 |  And also, the England players are looking like they're really enjoying it, you touched on it there,
[4351.00 - 4355.00] P:1637.67 E:0.097904 |  but the way that they're just trying things together on the edge of the box,
[4355.00 - 4359.00] P:1699.98 E:0.103035 |  and when things don't go off in the first half, there was this real frustration,
[4359.00 - 4361.00] P:1583.59 E:0.104612 |  a looking round, we weren't quite sure.
[4361.00 - 4365.00] P:1617.76 E:0.094238 |  There they're like, OK, it's fine, we'll just go again, we'll just try something else.
[4365.00 - 4370.00] P:1616.28 E:0.101214 |  Just on John Stones, immediately, it was Eric Dyer and Conor Coley getting up to warm up.
[4370.00 - 4375.00] P:1457.36 E:0.088987 |  They've been joined now by three others, but there was a straight reaction from the bench.
[4375.00 - 4380.00] P:1549.51 E:0.104440 |  Yeah, I just saw him, Green, he just pulled up a little bit, you know,
[4380.00 - 4383.00] P:1740.24 E:0.102341 |  you've had a sprint and you bend down and you just stretch your hand,
[4383.00 - 4385.00] P:1551.83 E:0.091103 |  and you touch the back of your hamstring.
[4385.00 - 4388.00] P:1488.82 E:0.107177 |  I'm just watching him walking now, John Stones, he's kicking his leg out a little bit,
[4388.00 - 4393.00] P:1350.56 E:0.094552 |  he's not laboring as such, but he looks like he feels something.
[4393.00 - 4397.00] P:1471.00 E:0.098395 |  I know the feeling very well, man.
[4397.00 - 4402.00] P:1322.13 E:0.104285 |  You know, the number of times I've seen footballers do that, you know, where they did it.
[4402.00 - 4404.00] P:1361.06 E:0.105760 |  They've never done it, never done it.
[4404.00 - 4406.00] P:1487.79 E:0.105821 |  The electric shock, isn't it?
[4406.00 - 4409.00] P:1268.36 E:0.092511 |  I love myself doing exactly that.
[4409.00 - 4413.00] P:1451.38 E:0.099714 |  However, it's turned out it's not the most concerning hamstring pull of the day.
[4413.00 - 4417.00] P:1490.81 E:0.101978 |  So we'll just keep an eye on John Stones, who seems to be moving okay.
[4417.00 - 4421.00] P:1568.14 E:0.092395 |  Stones puts his foot in, wins the ball back, he looks okay,
[4421.00 - 4425.00] P:1514.17 E:0.098702 |  and out to the left-hand side it goes, Shaw back to Kane,
[4425.00 - 4429.00] P:1441.33 E:0.101320 |  Kane finds the pass to Saka, well played from Harry Kane,
[4429.00 - 4433.00] P:1500.80 E:0.100459 |  Saka has got the overlap there as well, here is the ball in from Henderson,
[4433.00 - 4436.00] P:1369.07 E:0.098646 |  a stretch and away though, near the edge of the penalty area,
[4436.00 - 4439.00] P:1542.79 E:0.106808 |  and the ball goes to England who take possession again.
[4439.00 - 4442.00] P:1431.77 E:0.096164 |  If you just switched on to us on Five Live with this scoreline,
[4442.00 - 4447.00] P:1504.87 E:0.095651 |  England are on course to set up a quarter-final back in this stadium,
[4447.00 - 4453.00] P:1425.21 E:0.091490 |  the Al Bay in the north of Doha, the big tenth stadium on Saturday night.
[4453.00 - 4456.00] P:1535.58 E:0.114437 |  Kane, Harry Kane's going to have a shot from this,
[4456.00 - 4459.00] P:1607.60 E:0.107365 |  and oh, meant he very nearly spilled it.
[4459.00 - 4462.00] P:1701.52 E:0.098475 |  Down to his right, the goalkeeper went, the Chelsea goalkeeper,
[4462.00 - 4465.00] P:1460.57 E:0.107752 |  squirmed away from him, back under his body to his side,
[4465.00 - 4468.00] P:1459.79 E:0.091578 |  but he was able to pick himself up,
[4468.00 - 4472.00] P:1410.95 E:0.099670 |  and that was not far away from squirming under his body.
[4472.00 - 4475.00] P:1604.17 E:0.094686 |  No, I mean it was a sharp piece of thinking from Harry Kane,
[4475.00 - 4478.00] P:1487.13 E:0.102018 |  because he just pulled the shot towards the near post,
[4478.00 - 4481.00] P:1510.03 E:0.101000 |  I think Mendy was anticipating the ball across the goal,
[4481.00 - 4483.00] P:1401.43 E:0.106857 |  but Greener, you must have had a great view of that,
[4483.00 - 4486.00] P:1275.83 E:0.081164 |  it was a difficult ball to handle from what I've seen.
[4487.00 - 4491.00] P:1389.60 E:0.101399 |  Rob will be with us in a moment or two,
[4491.00 - 4494.00] P:1570.82 E:0.097322 |  but England lose possession just inside their own half,
[4494.00 - 4497.00] P:1240.23 E:0.100123 |  so Senegal have got it back.
[4497.00 - 4500.00] P:1304.35 E:0.098266 |  Ball played along the halfway line, taps are,
[4500.00 - 4503.00] P:1602.59 E:0.100590 |  but in comes Shaw, strong challenge, good challenge to win it back,
[4503.00 - 4506.00] P:1618.56 E:0.101063 |  Shaw then up towards Harry Kane, Kane has a look to his left,
[4506.00 - 4509.00] P:1526.06 E:0.103845 |  challenge comes in on him, but the ball bounces to Fortun,
[4509.00 - 4511.00] P:1728.19 E:0.108783 |  Fortun's away, keeps his feet on the left,
[4511.00 - 4515.00] P:1751.31 E:0.113204 |  Fortun's crossed, Saka is in there, it's three-nil,
[4515.00 - 4518.00] P:1620.27 E:0.117696 |  oh what a lovely finish from Fukaya Saka,
[4518.00 - 4522.00] P:1603.06 E:0.115994 |  but that was Bill Fortun who is the creator this time,
[4522.00 - 4526.00] P:1769.98 E:0.112926 |  brilliant, kept his feet, in came the ball,
[4526.00 - 4529.00] P:1759.22 E:0.105671 |  and with his left foot in the six yard box,
[4529.00 - 4533.00] P:1682.36 E:0.109627 |  Fukaya Saka makes it three-nil to England
[4533.00 - 4536.00] P:1815.05 E:0.104287 |  and scores his third goal at this World Cup,
[4536.00 - 4540.00] P:1638.34 E:0.109750 |  and England now can begin to look to the quarter-final
[4540.00 - 4544.00] P:1686.83 E:0.111772 |  and to France here on Saturday night.
[4544.00 - 4547.00] P:1559.15 E:0.117774 |  Fortun's just like, well it's just absolute cruise control
[4547.00 - 4550.00] P:1683.53 E:0.111718 |  from England now, you know that goal there,
[4550.00 - 4553.00] P:1712.77 E:0.114837 |  it's been such a confident start to this second half,
[4553.00 - 4557.00] P:1510.52 E:0.123236 |  but Bill Fortun just rides the challenges brilliantly,
[4557.00 - 4559.00] P:1542.90 E:0.131412 |  that man Bellingham, he's on the run again,
[4559.00 - 4561.00] P:1390.78 E:0.120252 |  dragging defenders all over the place,
[4561.00 - 4563.00] P:1524.30 E:0.127205 |  so Fortun gets isolated out wide,
[4563.00 - 4565.00] P:1380.19 E:0.126841 |  and he's skipped past one tackle,
[4565.00 - 4567.00] P:1637.07 E:0.125294 |  Kula Barley comes out to try and block the cross,
[4567.00 - 4570.00] P:1445.96 E:0.122055 |  and Fortun just pops it straight through his legs,
[4570.00 - 4573.00] P:1376.84 E:0.124242 |  he sees Saka, I mean it's a brilliant cross,
[4573.00 - 4576.00] P:1415.95 E:0.130985 |  I have to say, England in these areas of the pitch today
[4576.00 - 4578.00] P:1421.77 E:0.129713 |  are delivery from wide areas,
[4578.00 - 4580.00] P:1361.95 E:0.116663 |  it's been absolutely spot on,
[4580.00 - 4582.00] P:1352.39 E:0.124856 |  and the finish from Saka, well,
[4582.00 - 4584.00] P:1535.95 E:0.118416 |  it's a lovely little depth touch with his left foot,
[4584.00 - 4586.00] P:1582.23 E:0.118874 |  he sees Mendy coming out,
[4586.00 - 4589.00] P:1510.21 E:0.105606 |  and it's just a little lift up into the air,
[4589.00 - 4591.00] P:1449.52 E:0.086563 |  into an empty goal,
[4591.00 - 4593.00] P:1689.48 E:0.107469 |  Super got all three goals, John,
[4593.00 - 4595.00] P:1471.60 E:0.104202 |  they've been brilliant pieces of quality,
[4595.00 - 4597.00] P:1592.92 E:0.108109 |  and you know, the wide areas we're exploiting,
[4597.00 - 4599.00] P:1579.46 E:0.094004 |  it's absolutely superb.
[4599.00 - 4602.00] P:1452.54 E:0.112957 |  And England goalkeeper Rob Green's got the ground level
[4602.00 - 4604.00] P:1578.46 E:0.100405 |  view on that.
[4604.00 - 4606.00] P:1771.41 E:0.109394 |  It was directly in front of me,
[4606.00 - 4609.00] P:1506.50 E:0.117297 |  and the way that Phil Foden wrote those challenges
[4609.00 - 4611.00] P:1692.53 E:0.119951 |  was just brilliant, he knew they were coming,
[4611.00 - 4614.00] P:1599.24 E:0.115825 |  he knew he was going to take it here at some point,
[4614.00 - 4616.00] P:1674.11 E:0.112834 |  but Kent is composure,
[4616.00 - 4619.00] P:1515.71 E:0.103824 |  and as you say, that's that little dink,
[4619.00 - 4622.00] P:1610.16 E:0.109455 |  knowing where the goal is, a guy full of confidence,
[4622.00 - 4624.00] P:1705.73 E:0.097065 |  full of smiles afterwards,
[4624.00 - 4626.00] P:1725.32 E:0.102073 |  three, four yards in front of me,
[4626.00 - 4629.00] P:1638.50 E:0.093049 |  just everybody, just pure joy,
[4629.00 - 4632.00] P:1757.77 E:0.103819 |  it was a real goal of pleasure and enjoyment,
[4632.00 - 4636.00] P:1549.57 E:0.101929 |  and just some young lads loving playing football together,
[4636.00 - 4638.00] P:1641.11 E:0.091313 |  and he's brilliant to see.
[4638.00 - 4641.00] P:1513.34 E:0.099754 |  And listen, as Saka makes a run through the middle,
[4641.00 - 4643.00] P:1384.46 E:0.112188 |  England are greedy here, they're looking for more,
[4643.00 - 4645.00] P:1660.60 E:0.086549 |  Kent to Henderson, Henderson,
[4645.00 - 4647.00] P:1416.74 E:0.105198 |  it could open up for England once more,
[4647.00 - 4649.00] P:1578.15 E:0.090926 |  walk up with the cross,
[4649.00 - 4651.00] P:1557.99 E:0.109184 |  but that's blocked, hits the defender,
[4651.00 - 4653.00] P:1472.51 E:0.106161 |  and is out of play for a throw on the right.
[4653.00 - 4656.00] P:1486.81 E:0.100681 |  Well, Senegal have to kind of get together a little bit here,
[4656.00 - 4658.00] P:1527.80 E:0.116746 |  they're really struggling at the moment with the movement
[4658.00 - 4662.00] P:1553.88 E:0.111671 |  and the interplay, and the ability for Saka and Fodos,
[4662.00 - 4664.00] P:1589.58 E:0.109799 |  I'm in the pitch, go out the pitch,
[4664.00 - 4667.00] P:1366.33 E:0.109168 |  the runs from deep from Bellingham and Henderson,
[4667.00 - 4671.00] P:1362.82 E:0.095292 |  I think Jacobs and Savali are about decent games,
[4671.00 - 4674.00] P:1396.92 E:0.100491 |  but they're really struggling to cope in wide areas at the moment.
[4674.00 - 4676.00] P:1391.48 E:0.087668 |  Throw in for England, a long one,
[4676.00 - 4678.00] P:1408.04 E:0.109521 |  looking for Kent inside the area,
[4678.00 - 4680.00] P:1468.91 E:0.092417 |  Senegal are struggling here,
[4680.00 - 4683.00] P:1583.96 E:0.099492 |  that was a tired header away on the edge of the box,
[4683.00 - 4686.00] P:1395.60 E:0.092795 |  but it runs to Savali here, down below us,
[4686.00 - 4688.00] P:1498.30 E:0.107274 |  way, way down below us,
[4688.00 - 4691.00] P:1445.31 E:0.102699 |  we're high on the dressing room side of the ground, Savali,
[4691.00 - 4694.00] P:1489.87 E:0.099498 |  is then tackled, actually fouled by Bellingham,
[4694.00 - 4696.00] P:1513.84 E:0.088747 |  who missed time that,
[4696.00 - 4700.00] P:1441.48 E:0.104926 |  he's handed out a few of his own,
[4700.00 - 4702.00] P:1503.92 E:0.105475 |  but he's been on the receiving end,
[4702.00 - 4705.00] P:1234.38 E:0.108402 |  and still, we've actually not had a yellow card in the match.
[4705.00 - 4707.00] P:1570.03 E:0.086080 |  I mean, he could have easily got a yellow card,
[4707.00 - 4709.00] P:1639.79 E:0.108016 |  but I think his reaction straight after,
[4709.00 - 4711.00] P:1337.11 E:0.091989 |  there wasn't masses of contact,
[4711.00 - 4713.00] P:1454.16 E:0.091373 |  but he certainly goes to ground,
[4713.00 - 4716.00] P:1475.14 E:0.094802 |  and I think that the tackles just jumped,
[4716.00 - 4718.00] P:1282.00 E:0.100551 |  so there's not really any contact,
[4718.00 - 4720.00] P:1671.70 E:0.101585 |  and he apologises straight away to the referee,
[4720.00 - 4722.00] P:1375.30 E:0.095664 |  and I think he just looked at him and thought,
[4722.00 - 4723.00] P:1615.13 E:0.113824 |  okay, I'll let you off,
[4723.00 - 4725.00] P:1619.31 E:0.106659 |  but could have easily got a yellow card,
[4725.00 - 4728.00] P:1346.48 E:0.103547 |  and like you say, it's a clean disciplinary record, isn't it,
[4728.00 - 4730.00] P:1437.16 E:0.091893 |  that England have in this tournament?
[4730.00 - 4732.00] P:1471.69 E:0.102861 |  So, Vukai Osaka,
[4732.00 - 4735.00] P:1635.88 E:0.092978 |  scoring what is his seventh goal for England,
[4735.00 - 4738.00] P:1494.82 E:0.101541 |  and that's becoming, you know, that's a good total now,
[4738.00 - 4740.00] P:1429.42 E:0.092982 |  seven in what is 23 appearances,
[4740.00 - 4742.00] P:1547.08 E:0.105202 |  three at this World Cup,
[4742.00 - 4746.00] P:1612.10 E:0.097536 |  and again, as we discussed during the game against Iran,
[4746.00 - 4748.00] P:1631.08 E:0.091399 |  you know, after the finals last year,
[4748.00 - 4750.00] P:1564.25 E:0.102445 |  and what happened to Vukai Osaka at the end,
[4750.00 - 4752.00] P:1649.08 E:0.096905 |  you know, to come back in the next tournament,
[4752.00 - 4754.00] P:1649.25 E:0.099936 |  his first World Cup, and do this.
[4754.00 - 4757.00] P:1658.47 E:0.100301 |  This is highly notable from the young Arsenal man.
[4757.00 - 4760.00] P:1633.42 E:0.115032 |  Here is Kane, oh, lovely, leaves Kula Balli on the ground,
[4760.00 - 4762.00] P:1735.16 E:0.099287 |  now fordons on to this,
[4762.00 - 4764.00] P:1550.79 E:0.106523 |  but the covering challenges are there this time,
[4764.00 - 4766.00] P:1384.29 E:0.103565 |  and Kula Balli was able to get up
[4766.00 - 4768.00] P:1554.92 E:0.087138 |  and get a touch back to goalkeeper Mendy.
[4768.00 - 4770.00] P:1652.84 E:0.084692 |  I'm midfield three at the moment,
[4770.00 - 4772.00] P:1578.95 E:0.113641 |  they're just absolutely on fire.
[4772.00 - 4774.00] P:1282.28 E:0.087372 |  I know we've been talking a lot about Bellingham,
[4774.00 - 4776.00] P:1384.93 E:0.111837 |  but the performances of Henderson and Rice as well, John.
[4776.00 - 4779.00] P:1358.34 E:0.098234 |  I mean, to sit behind those three is centre-backs.
[4779.00 - 4782.00] P:1344.75 E:0.100946 |  They're just scrapping for every ball in the middle of the park,
[4782.00 - 4784.00] P:1463.74 E:0.089473 |  they're cutting out passes,
[4784.00 - 4787.00] P:1564.26 E:0.109161 |  they're just out manoeuvring Senegal in the middle of the park,
[4787.00 - 4789.00] P:1445.50 E:0.099352 |  and they just haven't got an answer for them.
[4789.00 - 4791.00] P:1506.49 E:0.093938 |  Well, the point is, man, you're not changing this now, are you?
[4791.00 - 4793.00] P:1493.81 E:0.086421 |  No, no, I don't think so.
[4793.00 - 4795.00] P:1530.26 E:0.090549 |  I think that, you know, we spoke a lot about
[4795.00 - 4797.00] P:1440.63 E:0.107636 |  seeing what the right balance is for England,
[4797.00 - 4799.00] P:1212.97 E:0.101471 |  but at the moment, those three
[4799.00 - 4801.00] P:1474.16 E:0.105080 |  sat in the middle of the park, he's just doing wonders.
[4801.00 - 4803.00] P:1247.71 E:0.097114 |  Yeah, all of the pre-tournament talk.
[4803.00 - 4806.00] P:1382.50 E:0.096821 |  Well, since the Euros, after England changed it
[4806.00 - 4809.00] P:1492.71 E:0.100490 |  during the course of the tournament last year,
[4809.00 - 4812.00] P:1479.90 E:0.099948 |  and switched when it came to the knockout stages
[4812.00 - 4814.00] P:1440.57 E:0.099497 |  to three central defenders,
[4814.00 - 4818.00] P:1299.86 E:0.096691 |  well, you know, such as the quality of England's play
[4818.00 - 4821.00] P:1470.96 E:0.096636 |  when they're coming forward, and this midfield three,
[4821.00 - 4823.00] P:1536.02 E:0.103252 |  when you think about taking on France,
[4823.00 - 4825.00] P:1412.11 E:0.099254 |  which of course we have to do now,
[4825.00 - 4831.00] P:1450.83 E:0.082400 |  then it would seem that England
[4831.00 - 4834.00] P:1548.26 E:0.099015 |  would surely stay with Henderson, Rice and Ballinger.
[4834.00 - 4838.00] P:1434.32 E:0.094265 |  We've got another stoppage, there's an injury
[4838.00 - 4840.00] P:1379.53 E:0.108391 |  to one of the Cameroon players, actually,
[4840.00 - 4843.00] P:1184.76 E:0.105561 |  it's Mila Sarr, I think it's going to be OK,
[4843.00 - 4845.00] P:1346.56 E:0.102813 |  but I think it changes him and Rob Green.
[4845.00 - 4848.00] P:1527.82 E:0.100529 |  Yeah, two players who play from the pass so far,
[4848.00 - 4851.00] P:1763.32 E:0.101257 |  Jack Greenish and Marcus Rashford are stripped off,
[4851.00 - 4853.00] P:1615.45 E:0.078772 |  ready to come on.
[4855.00 - 4860.00] P:1700.70 E:0.097278 |  Thank you, Rob. So Rashford will win his 50th cap here tonight.
[4860.00 - 4863.00] P:1447.89 E:0.100520 |  Next time I would imagine the ball goes out of play,
[4863.00 - 4866.00] P:1491.22 E:0.093749 |  and yes, we can now see Jack Greenish preparing himself
[4866.00 - 4868.00] P:1482.63 E:0.100923 |  to come on into the action.
[4868.00 - 4872.00] P:1545.12 E:0.092275 |  But England in control, Matt Upsson, leading by three goals to nil.
[4872.00 - 4875.00] P:1547.43 E:0.098892 |  Absolutely, cruise control now, it really is,
[4875.00 - 4878.00] P:1228.21 E:0.089149 |  he's just stroking the ball around,
[4878.00 - 4881.00] P:1537.97 E:0.104859 |  still getting bodies forward and having those moments,
[4881.00 - 4884.00] P:1534.91 E:0.097095 |  those passages of play where our quality
[4884.00 - 4887.00] P:1539.63 E:0.099744 |  has carved the game open at several occasions,
[4887.00 - 4890.00] P:1420.04 E:0.099018 |  three excellent goals, a couple of them almost like breakaways,
[4890.00 - 4893.00] P:1371.02 E:0.096180 |  like counter attacks, but some of the movement we've seen
[4893.00 - 4896.00] P:1332.70 E:0.090715 |  from Foden and Saka has been excellent,
[4896.00 - 4899.00] P:1431.05 E:0.099843 |  and England in absolute total control of this game at the moment.
[4899.00 - 4902.00] P:1522.43 E:0.089477 |  England three, Senegal nil,
[4902.00 - 4906.00] P:1449.67 E:0.096871 |  and England dominated possession in the second half,
[4906.00 - 4909.00] P:1540.92 E:0.095673 |  scored the third goal, and now it looks as though
[4909.00 - 4911.00] P:1363.55 E:0.095831 |  this is the end of the road for Senegal,
[4911.00 - 4914.00] P:1542.13 E:0.091436 |  and the changes are going to be made,
[4914.00 - 4917.00] P:1438.22 E:0.107661 |  so Marcus Rashford is going to step forward,
[4917.00 - 4920.00] P:1195.92 E:0.103629 |  and this is exactly what Gareth Southgate was looking for,
[4920.00 - 4922.00] P:1259.74 E:0.110743 |  Jordan Henderson has taken a bang.
[4922.00 - 4925.00] P:1520.24 E:0.108094 |  Is that Henderson on the floor, that might change the substitutions a little bit?
[4925.00 - 4928.00] P:1442.11 E:0.101024 |  They're just going to delay it, Gareth Southgate is just saying,
[4928.00 - 4930.00] P:1488.83 E:0.099146 |  let's just see how Henderson is.
[4930.00 - 4932.00] P:1422.38 E:0.098790 |  I think it was just a coming together, wasn't it,
[4932.00 - 4934.00] P:1446.52 E:0.101896 |  with Jack Upsson the left back?
[4934.00 - 4937.00] P:1477.01 E:0.102952 |  I think he's holding the leg where the contact was,
[4937.00 - 4940.00] P:1499.85 E:0.104421 |  which was always good, it's never good to hold a leg,
[4940.00 - 4943.00] P:1384.31 E:0.093377 |  and it's a little turning, but I think it's just a kick.
[4943.00 - 4945.00] P:1514.29 E:0.093495 |  Down to Rob Green.
[4945.00 - 4947.00] P:1819.27 E:0.110294 |  Yeah, I don't think there's too much concern,
[4947.00 - 4950.00] P:1711.88 E:0.104038 |  and it's one of the goalscorer's in Bacow,
[4950.00 - 4953.00] P:1740.96 E:0.100367 |  Saka who's coming off, who's just received a pat on the back
[4953.00 - 4956.00] P:1828.40 E:0.110104 |  from a couple of teammates, and it's making his way off,
[4956.00 - 4960.00] P:1783.54 E:0.108779 |  so that's one sub, and you'd imagine Phil Foden being the other,
[4960.00 - 4963.00] P:1685.03 E:0.101746 |  so it's two subs, like for Swaps,
[4963.00 - 4966.00] P:1621.38 E:0.119575 |  two players who played really well this evening here,
[4966.00 - 4970.00] P:1487.77 E:0.106442 |  and you think they'll make a real feature in the next game
[4970.00 - 4972.00] P:1620.67 E:0.101688 |  against France as well.
[4972.00 - 4978.00] P:1508.12 E:0.114965 |  So, Off-Goal, Foden and Saka, who both meet,
[4978.00 - 4980.00] P:1517.33 E:0.119025 |  find contributions this evening.
[4980.00 - 4983.00] P:1493.58 E:0.108466 |  Phil Foden with his all-round game,
[4983.00 - 4986.00] P:1421.03 E:0.114271 |  and Saka scoring his third goal at this World Cup, Matt Upsson.
[4986.00 - 4989.00] P:1586.52 E:0.102633 |  Yeah, I think they can walk off and hold their head high,
[4989.00 - 4992.00] P:1547.74 E:0.108524 |  and Gareth Southgate can have a look at his selection and say,
[4992.00 - 4994.00] P:1421.80 E:0.094648 |  yeah, I think we've got the right balance,
[4994.00 - 4997.00] P:1490.11 E:0.102308 |  I think we've got the right people in the right positions,
[4997.00 - 5000.00] P:1493.86 E:0.100811 |  but those two especially, I think have been excellent,
[5000.00 - 5006.00] P:1519.47 E:0.094410 |  and it's just another example of the quality of the youth of this England team.
[5006.00 - 5010.00] P:1617.58 E:0.101192 |  Henderson's OK, that's the good news from his point of view,
[5010.00 - 5012.00] P:1547.16 E:0.105345 |  takes this free kick actually, back to Walker,
[5012.00 - 5016.00] P:1536.00 E:0.097486 |  and then Fortuna Maguire, who's picked up for a foul inside the penalty area,
[5016.00 - 5018.00] P:1517.83 E:0.088114 |  there were two defenders either side of him.
[5018.00 - 5022.00] P:1648.78 E:0.098696 |  So Phil Foden and Bukai and Saka actually left the field on the far side,
[5022.00 - 5027.00] P:1603.00 E:0.090908 |  which means they've had that very pleasant walk around the far side,
[5027.00 - 5029.00] P:1589.00 E:0.098546 |  and in front of all of the England fans,
[5029.00 - 5031.00] P:1384.91 E:0.104071 |  and indeed Rob Green down there as well,
[5031.00 - 5034.00] P:1529.45 E:0.101446 |  and they've been able to take the acclaimed 3-0 up and enjoy the walk.
[5034.00 - 5037.00] P:1447.15 E:0.080290 |  It's pleasant when it's in front of your own fans, isn't it?
[5037.00 - 5040.00] P:1393.00 E:0.092817 |  Maybe not the opposition, but certain grounds.
[5040.00 - 5044.00] P:1440.64 E:0.098501 |  In all honesty, I think walking past these Senegal fans inside this ground,
[5044.00 - 5046.00] P:1565.46 E:0.092086 |  they were brilliant actually during the anthem as well,
[5046.00 - 5051.00] P:1489.86 E:0.093725 |  I was going to mention that, they gave the national anthem, the English anthem,
[5051.00 - 5053.00] P:1528.48 E:0.105043 |  a lovely reception, they applauded it.
[5053.00 - 5055.00] P:1472.73 E:0.103200 |  Oh, they were great set-up forwards, they're still going.
[5055.00 - 5057.00] P:1381.57 E:0.112518 |  They're a great loss to the World Cup.
[5057.00 - 5060.00] P:1609.22 E:0.100460 |  The swaying and the drumming and the rhythm is all still there,
[5060.00 - 5062.00] P:1365.38 E:0.098642 |  they're having a great time in the stand.
[5062.00 - 5065.00] P:1514.13 E:0.096598 |  So England leads Senegal by three goals to nail,
[5065.00 - 5068.00] P:1623.54 E:0.093255 |  Henderson came and Saka, so Rashford is on.
[5068.00 - 5073.00] P:1596.99 E:0.095835 |  Marcus Rashford has come on as a substitute in three of the four matches.
[5073.00 - 5075.00] P:1497.94 E:0.091090 |  Quite a bold call, wasn't it?
[5075.00 - 5078.00] P:1369.03 E:0.092264 |  Two goals against Wales, to leave them out today.
[5078.00 - 5083.00] P:1531.92 E:0.091185 |  Yeah, it was a bold call, but some players are great at having impact.
[5083.00 - 5086.00] P:1449.39 E:0.094316 |  I think Rashford comes to that category.
[5086.00 - 5090.00] P:1640.18 E:0.096813 |  Rises fouled, Senderfield, fours played into him by Rashford,
[5090.00 - 5094.00] P:1494.59 E:0.091638 |  but the challenge came in from Ismail Assar, so a free kick to England.
[5094.00 - 5098.00] P:1532.66 E:0.092802 |  But Marcus Rashford's got Kylian and Vata to catch now.
[5098.00 - 5099.00] P:1063.07 E:0.072601 |  Yeah.
[5099.00 - 5102.00] P:1442.47 E:0.096178 |  Was joint top scorer at the World Cup this morning,
[5102.00 - 5104.00] P:1334.19 E:0.093155 |  and Vata has now moved to ahead of him?
[5104.00 - 5107.00] P:1395.77 E:0.090014 |  Well, I think there's going to be an opportunity for him in this game.
[5107.00 - 5113.00] P:1356.17 E:0.091249 |  The way Senegal are now, they find it very difficult to cope with the movement
[5113.00 - 5115.00] P:1549.92 E:0.094741 |  and just keep up with how England are playing.
[5115.00 - 5119.00] P:1385.12 E:0.097354 |  If England want us to keep pushing it, don't be surprised
[5119.00 - 5121.00] P:1459.95 E:0.098167 |  if Rashford gets presented with an opportunity
[5121.00 - 5123.00] P:1632.86 E:0.106257 |  and maybe just drags one of those goals back.
[5123.00 - 5129.00] P:1549.50 E:0.092758 |  And Jack Grealish has now come on as a substitute in all four matches of this World Cup.
[5129.00 - 5134.00] P:1493.22 E:0.098028 |  So Grealish is on for what is his 28th cap.
[5134.00 - 5136.00] P:1628.30 E:0.111026 |  50th cap for Rashford.
[5136.00 - 5140.00] P:1494.40 E:0.088448 |  Great moment, great milestone for any international footballer.
[5140.00 - 5143.00] P:1278.10 E:0.104471 |  I remember very well seeing his debut when he scored
[5143.00 - 5148.00] P:1527.43 E:0.098440 |  in the first couple of minutes against Australia before Euro 2016.
[5148.00 - 5151.00] P:1503.66 E:0.097079 |  And it's been quite a journey.
[5151.00 - 5155.00] P:1464.79 E:0.092972 |  There have been some great ups and little periods as well
[5155.00 - 5160.00] P:1518.11 E:0.090162 |  where he's just not been in contention, but he's got that 50th cap
[5160.00 - 5163.00] P:1585.07 E:0.092760 |  and to do it at a World Cup, well done him.
[5163.00 - 5166.00] P:1432.32 E:0.098679 |  Senegal coming forward with the ball on the right-hand side,
[5166.00 - 5170.00] P:1597.18 E:0.088711 |  Sabali playing it through, but Diya went one way and the ball went the other.
[5170.00 - 5175.00] P:1523.25 E:0.093853 |  And I'm afraid this match for Senegal has very much got the look
[5175.00 - 5178.00] P:1551.89 E:0.089996 |  of an exit from the World Cup in the next half hour or so.
[5178.00 - 5181.00] P:1481.43 E:0.095924 |  You can really feel it in the tempo of the game now, can't you?
[5181.00 - 5188.00] P:1460.69 E:0.087783 |  And the mood around the stadium, that third goal really has put the result to bed for England.
[5188.00 - 5191.00] P:1531.89 E:0.090002 |  And Senegal are just kind of hanging in there.
[5191.00 - 5195.00] P:1544.70 E:0.101625 |  They're almost not able to take this game to England at the moment,
[5195.00 - 5198.00] P:1520.32 E:0.105184 |  such as the quality of the midfield and the press.
[5198.00 - 5203.00] P:1595.22 E:0.102182 |  I'm looking at Declan Rice just sprinting straight out to Mendy, I think it is,
[5203.00 - 5207.00] P:1630.59 E:0.095184 |  who had the ball and it's just relentlessness from our midfield three at the moment.
[5207.00 - 5213.00] P:1709.61 E:0.085617 |  England three up, but Senegal coming forward towards the edge of the box.
[5213.00 - 5219.00] P:1684.67 E:0.092309 |  He's played back into centrefield and Papsar tries a shot that is immediately closed down,
[5219.00 - 5222.00] P:1364.11 E:0.096789 |  but it bounces back into the centre circle, Mendy is there.
[5222.00 - 5233.00] P:1591.23 E:0.094350 |  And Nampoli's Mendy out to the left-hand side, where Senegal with his Milosar
[5233.00 - 5236.00] P:1472.48 E:0.098641 |  crosses from the left flank of that land on the roof of the net.
[5236.00 - 5242.00] P:1592.66 E:0.099590 |  And it's all rather vain, isn't it now, for Senegal, who came through in such good.
[5242.00 - 5243.00] P:1590.40 E:0.091316 |  Yeah.
[5243.00 - 5247.00] P:1617.93 E:0.097882 |  Fashion against Ecuador to get into the knockout stages of this World Cup,
[5247.00 - 5249.00] P:1598.64 E:0.103369 |  but they look like a beaten team.
[5249.00 - 5254.00] P:1550.76 E:0.102227 |  Yeah, I think England have managed to keep their wide players relatively quiet as well.
[5254.00 - 5259.00] P:1576.34 E:0.097334 |  Sartre has had a really big impact for Senegal coming off that left-hand side,
[5259.00 - 5263.00] P:1541.85 E:0.097850 |  you know, just driving into the box, winning penalties, being a nuisance,
[5263.00 - 5266.00] P:1724.96 E:0.096435 |  but England have coped with that, OK.
[5266.00 - 5268.00] P:1647.64 E:0.093495 |  It's just been more in the first half when we had the ball
[5268.00 - 5270.00] P:1466.24 E:0.107066 |  and we weren't quite sure about our movements
[5270.00 - 5272.00] P:1442.12 E:0.100135 |  and the quality of passing wasn't quite there.
[5272.00 - 5275.00] P:1333.39 E:0.102498 |  We looked a little bit vulnerable, but other than that,
[5275.00 - 5279.00] P:1376.64 E:0.099139 |  especially this second half being super controlled from England.
[5279.00 - 5285.00] P:1464.97 E:0.102852 |  This is five-life and BBC sounds were across Africa on the World Service as well.
[5285.00 - 5288.00] P:1520.86 E:0.100127 |  And I'm sure, you know, if Sadio Manier had been fit,
[5288.00 - 5293.00] P:1566.70 E:0.100586 |  you know, that was such a bad break for Senegal to lose him
[5293.00 - 5296.00] P:1368.48 E:0.099567 |  as England come forward with Henderson again on the right-hand side,
[5296.00 - 5298.00] P:1443.31 E:0.100946 |  Henderson playing it round the defender, then threw himself to the ground,
[5298.00 - 5302.00] P:1415.28 E:0.094393 |  but he wasn't going to win that free kick and Senegal bring it away.
[5302.00 - 5305.00] P:1448.54 E:0.100846 |  You know, they needed all hands on deck really for Senegal to this match.
[5305.00 - 5308.00] P:1484.31 E:0.098688 |  I think another player that we haven't really touched on was Czech Coéter,
[5308.00 - 5310.00] P:1414.52 E:0.086458 |  who got injured in the first game.
[5310.00 - 5314.00] P:1402.16 E:0.093868 |  I mean, experienced, Premier League, defensive midfield player,
[5314.00 - 5318.00] P:1421.44 E:0.101029 |  you know, he gets injured and I think the Netherlands scored both their goals
[5318.00 - 5321.00] P:1585.77 E:0.104639 |  after he goes off the pitch, so he provided that really good screen
[5321.00 - 5325.00] P:1507.87 E:0.091388 |  in front of the back three or back four, so, you know, we haven't touched on him,
[5325.00 - 5328.00] P:1355.19 E:0.102990 |  but I think he's a big miss in the tournament like this for Senegal.
[5328.00 - 5331.00] P:1446.33 E:0.105829 |  Yeah, lost Bounassar by Enméonique as well, the full back.
[5331.00 - 5336.00] P:1552.91 E:0.094715 |  So injuries have really cost, as he says, team,
[5336.00 - 5340.00] P:1481.31 E:0.099887 |  and to get through to the last 16, actually, was in these circumstances.
[5340.00 - 5343.00] P:1337.18 E:0.096515 |  That can be classed as an achievement.
[5343.00 - 5347.00] P:1520.97 E:0.102127 |  But England just sitting off, just having a breather in the game at the moment,
[5347.00 - 5351.00] P:1559.69 E:0.099573 |  actually, and allowing Senegal some possession, which they've got on the right.
[5351.00 - 5356.00] P:1565.20 E:0.095262 |  Savali is dispossessed by Grealish with those white socks,
[5356.00 - 5361.00] P:1521.51 E:0.097872 |  three quarters of the way down his calves, Grealish does well, finds the space,
[5361.00 - 5365.00] P:1425.82 E:0.094433 |  and then Rice is bundled over, and it's a free kick to England in front of that penalty area.
[5365.00 - 5367.00] P:1388.35 E:0.106863 |  He wasn't going to be panicked there, was he?
[5367.00 - 5370.00] P:1587.28 E:0.099341 |  Jack Grealish, crikey, near his own corner flag,
[5370.00 - 5374.00] P:1572.31 E:0.102989 |  just waiting and waiting, maneuvering the ball using his strength, using his footwork,
[5374.00 - 5378.00] P:1482.99 E:0.099307 |  and then all of a sudden the pass opens up and he just pops it through to Rice,
[5378.00 - 5381.00] P:1577.49 E:0.094019 |  and England are out switching the play on the other side,
[5381.00 - 5387.00] P:1434.90 E:0.092486 |  and little indication of the relaxed quality that England are playing with right now.
[5387.00 - 5392.00] P:1531.02 E:0.098031 |  Next change for Senegal, the number nine, Boulay Gia,
[5392.00 - 5396.00] P:1376.64 E:0.104069 |  who had a big chance early on in the game, he has been substituted,
[5396.00 - 5401.00] P:1301.88 E:0.108590 |  and it's the former Bristol City man, Kamara Jeju, who comes on to play up front,
[5401.00 - 5407.00] P:1236.68 E:0.093713 |  who is now playing in Turkey with Alanya Spoor.
[5407.00 - 5415.00] P:1599.59 E:0.089309 |  So that is the fourth change that Senegal have made, so Jeju is on up front.
[5415.00 - 5418.00] P:1488.39 E:0.111118 |  Go back down to Rob Green in a moment, but Senegal bringing the ball forward
[5418.00 - 5420.00] P:1313.35 E:0.087520 |  up the left-hand side, but the ball was out of play.
[5420.00 - 5423.00] P:1599.16 E:0.086522 |  So Rob, what are you thinking at the moment?
[5423.00 - 5427.00] P:1700.62 E:0.110242 |  Yeah, just you always sense from the crowd how you think the game's going
[5427.00 - 5432.00] P:1687.99 E:0.098006 |  and what they're thinking about the game, and two or three times they've tried to start a Mexican wave,
[5432.00 - 5436.00] P:1670.65 E:0.090476 |  so I think you know that they think the game is up with that.
[5436.00 - 5439.00] P:1696.21 E:0.104712 |  Just when you're talking about the midfield, I've been watching Declan Rice,
[5439.00 - 5444.00] P:1704.76 E:0.097954 |  and he almost prowls in the centre of midfield, watching and waiting,
[5444.00 - 5447.00] P:1604.58 E:0.090489 |  and it's the third pass that he waits for.
[5447.00 - 5452.00] P:1697.03 E:0.096500 |  He waits and waits, he then sprints and reads the third pass in the move,
[5452.00 - 5455.00] P:1632.03 E:0.087879 |  and he's ready to pounce, and that's when he goes.
[5455.00 - 5459.00] P:1641.81 E:0.096053 |  Senegal coming forward and winning a free kick, 25 yards out,
[5459.00 - 5463.00] P:1561.12 E:0.097650 |  while Marcus Rashford was actually down, holding his head on the far side,
[5463.00 - 5467.00] P:1463.81 E:0.093511 |  taking a bang on the back of the head, I think from an aerial challenge,
[5467.00 - 5470.00] P:1577.82 E:0.091970 |  I'm sure how much there was in that, that he's back on his feet,
[5470.00 - 5474.00] P:1513.78 E:0.094245 |  he's able to take up a position, and Senegal have this free kick in a good position.
[5474.00 - 5478.00] P:1495.78 E:0.095551 |  Yeah, it's a decent position, it's a fair way out in fairness,
[5478.00 - 5484.00] P:1512.75 E:0.089841 |  whether or not they've got that kind of capability to hit the ball flat
[5484.00 - 5487.00] P:1492.45 E:0.081788 |  and bounce it in front of Pickford.
[5487.00 - 5490.00] P:1499.32 E:0.094800 |  Can't quite see who it is, he's going to take the free kick.
[5490.00 - 5495.00] P:1561.87 E:0.092166 |  I think it might be Pappesar on the ball with his right foot,
[5495.00 - 5498.00] P:1658.65 E:0.105069 |  let's see if he has a shot, or just maybe tries to click this one,
[5498.00 - 5501.00] P:1575.95 E:0.095403 |  it's far enough out, John, just to float it to the back post for another player
[5501.00 - 5503.00] P:1529.74 E:0.099904 |  to head it back across the goal.
[5503.00 - 5507.00] P:1659.03 E:0.096282 |  Two-man England wall, it's between 25 and 30 yards out,
[5507.00 - 5511.00] P:1712.20 E:0.094818 |  and it's hit low, but Pickford's able to go down to his left,
[5511.00 - 5519.00] P:1661.21 E:0.091098 |  and the strike goalwards from Pappesar was probably a couple of feet wider the post,
[5519.00 - 5521.00] P:1573.29 E:0.094338 |  and Pickford knew it was going past.
[5521.00 - 5524.00] P:1558.44 E:0.103704 |  Yeah, the wall was well set up, he tried to go round the inside of the wall
[5524.00 - 5526.00] P:1397.60 E:0.099113 |  into the near post, he sets it out wide,
[5526.00 - 5529.00] P:1531.68 E:0.098020 |  just tries to bend that ball round with his right foot,
[5529.00 - 5533.00] P:1541.19 E:0.085787 |  but Jordan Pickford all the way across there, no problem for him.
[5533.00 - 5535.00] P:1645.31 E:0.102506 |  So a goal kick to England, so with these three goals,
[5535.00 - 5538.00] P:1661.64 E:0.096156 |  England have now scored 12 at this World Cup,
[5538.00 - 5541.00] P:1560.95 E:0.090970 |  so on their own as the leading scorers at the tournament,
[5541.00 - 5544.00] P:1475.28 E:0.094496 |  England against France on Saturday night,
[5544.00 - 5547.00] P:1527.95 E:0.089147 |  and another England change imminent, I think you can see Rob Green.
[5547.00 - 5551.00] P:1731.60 E:0.091463 |  Another couple, I think, Calvin Phillips is just stripping off
[5551.00 - 5553.00] P:1793.14 E:0.101321 |  and getting his shirt-mat shirt on,
[5553.00 - 5556.00] P:1721.02 E:0.094032 |  and someone who already has his one is ready to come on,
[5556.00 - 5559.00] P:1748.18 E:0.103715 |  getting his final instructions, Mason Mount,
[5559.00 - 5563.00] P:1713.34 E:0.089194 |  so some of the guys who started the tournament,
[5563.00 - 5565.00] P:1710.34 E:0.104004 |  and has also come on,
[5565.00 - 5567.00] P:1612.72 E:0.095799 |  he's something that they've seen before,
[5567.00 - 5569.00] P:1625.30 E:0.091749 |  we've seen before being ready to be made.
[5571.00 - 5575.00] P:1585.02 E:0.102863 |  Thank you, Rob, so England leading by three goals to Nail,
[5575.00 - 5577.00] P:1686.91 E:0.077929 |  and 12 goals,
[5577.00 - 5582.00] P:1533.88 E:0.098834 |  you know, when you think how potent England were in Russia four years ago,
[5582.00 - 5587.00] P:1497.65 E:0.087274 |  and you know, this is Gareth Southgate's England team
[5587.00 - 5591.00] P:1694.03 E:0.087437 |  that play with the handbrake on, that's not bad, Matt.
[5591.00 - 5593.00] P:1431.05 E:0.094733 |  I'd like to see him with the handbrake on.
[5595.00 - 5598.00] P:1513.78 E:0.099378 |  Well, the critics would as well, wouldn't they?
[5598.00 - 5600.00] P:1647.52 E:0.099929 |  Rice to Walker,
[5600.00 - 5602.00] P:1622.41 E:0.087042 |  and then the ball is played back into central defence,
[5602.00 - 5605.00] P:1608.88 E:0.089038 |  where John Stoneswell had it back to Jordan Pickford.
[5605.00 - 5607.00] P:1795.03 E:0.093778 |  It's the tournament you judged on?
[5607.00 - 5611.00] P:1581.53 E:0.093152 |  Yeah, I mean, we've all been talking about the variety of attacking talent
[5611.00 - 5613.00] P:1425.03 E:0.087666 |  England having, the depth,
[5613.00 - 5615.00] P:1256.55 E:0.091355 |  I think that's been the impressive thing,
[5615.00 - 5618.00] P:1384.35 E:0.104177 |  you mentioned how many goals, but those goals have come from
[5618.00 - 5620.00] P:1572.75 E:0.093076 |  lots of different names, John, haven't they?
[5620.00 - 5625.00] P:1543.89 E:0.100470 |  From all over the pitch, and especially on midfield and wide players,
[5625.00 - 5627.00] P:1540.62 E:0.094086 |  which is just great to see.
[5627.00 - 5630.00] P:1478.81 E:0.100268 |  Cooler Balli's putting a challenge on Harry Kane,
[5630.00 - 5636.00] P:1451.20 E:0.087831 |  just sort of got his knee into the back of his right leg,
[5636.00 - 5638.00] P:1516.82 E:0.095603 |  and Kane has gone down.
[5638.00 - 5642.00] P:1516.02 E:0.087851 |  I think it'll be a bruise, I don't think it'll be anything worse than that,
[5642.00 - 5644.00] P:1508.99 E:0.097339 |  and he is back up on his feet.
[5644.00 - 5646.00] P:1418.11 E:0.103318 |  It's a yellow card, but it was very much a tackle of,
[5646.00 - 5649.00] P:1402.07 E:0.097942 |  I've had enough of this game now, and I'm getting frustrated,
[5649.00 - 5652.00] P:1400.87 E:0.104025 |  and I'm just going to smash straight into the back of the centre forward
[5652.00 - 5654.00] P:1460.23 E:0.096285 |  when I get my next opportunity,
[5654.00 - 5656.00] P:1469.85 E:0.113017 |  and that's pretty much exactly what Cooler Balli did.
[5656.00 - 5659.00] P:1355.40 E:0.106245 |  So it's Jude Dalingham who is the next England player to make way,
[5659.00 - 5663.00] P:1277.26 E:0.108186 |  what a knight he's had, and also John Stones.
[5663.00 - 5666.00] P:1455.19 E:0.108239 |  We thought might have had a little issue,
[5666.00 - 5670.00] P:1576.63 E:0.087756 |  and John Stones is going to walk freely off the field.
[5670.00 - 5672.00] P:1604.72 E:0.106673 |  I'll ask Eris Southgate later how things are with him,
[5672.00 - 5675.00] P:1629.50 E:0.091645 |  but he's actually trotting, running off the field,
[5675.00 - 5677.00] P:1571.40 E:0.100210 |  and so coming on to replace him,
[5677.00 - 5680.00] P:1533.79 E:0.094306 |  Eric Dyer gets his second appearance at this World Cup,
[5680.00 - 5682.00] P:1558.69 E:0.091528 |  having come on as the substitute against Iran,
[5682.00 - 5685.00] P:1429.46 E:0.096727 |  and it was Mason Mount, wasn't it, who's come on?
[5685.00 - 5687.00] P:1455.46 E:0.076836 |  Mason Mount on, yes, that's correct,
[5687.00 - 5691.00] P:1490.07 E:0.094677 |  and John Stones just having a chat,
[5691.00 - 5693.00] P:1381.49 E:0.105825 |  too sure if there is a problem.
[5693.00 - 5695.00] P:1503.80 E:0.097803 |  Clearly isn't a problem, John,
[5695.00 - 5697.00] P:1394.40 E:0.106025 |  otherwise he wouldn't have been able to carry on.
[5697.00 - 5701.00] P:1347.77 E:0.102704 |  It's just interesting that they've taken him off in this moment.
[5701.00 - 5703.00] P:1257.53 E:0.104309 |  And Jude Dalingham's performance tonight?
[5703.00 - 5707.00] P:1379.46 E:0.100819 |  Ah, I mean, the talk's all going to be about Jude Dalingham
[5707.00 - 5708.00] P:1352.77 E:0.091635 |  from that first half.
[5708.00 - 5711.00] P:1369.50 E:0.103719 |  I think the whole of the England team have got that confidence
[5711.00 - 5713.00] P:1278.21 E:0.103545 |  and have played well in this second half,
[5713.00 - 5715.00] P:1222.36 E:0.105664 |  but he was the difference in the first.
[5715.00 - 5718.00] P:1350.07 E:0.108844 |  He was the one who's kind of led that charge
[5718.00 - 5721.00] P:1331.43 E:0.107445 |  by playing as freely and confidently as what he did
[5721.00 - 5723.00] P:1318.71 E:0.107295 |  right from the first whistle,
[5723.00 - 5727.00] P:1371.16 E:0.096800 |  and I just love his energy and what he brings to the game.
[5727.00 - 5730.00] P:1431.84 E:0.088635 |  He's been outstanding for England so far in this tournament.
[5730.00 - 5733.00] P:1595.73 E:0.096686 |  So, England with a free kick on the left-hand side.
[5733.00 - 5735.00] P:1448.30 E:0.095971 |  We're in the last 15 minutes now.
[5735.00 - 5737.00] P:1605.22 E:0.093372 |  There will be a 6-0-6 tonight.
[5737.00 - 5740.00] P:1662.95 E:0.093501 |  Once we've rounded up all of the day's World Cup news,
[5740.00 - 5743.00] P:1578.97 E:0.095278 |  Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton will take your calls,
[5743.00 - 5746.00] P:1636.61 E:0.091817 |  but England with a free kick, then Shaw plays in,
[5746.00 - 5749.00] P:1498.67 E:0.100102 |  high across the penalty area, McGuire heads it back,
[5749.00 - 5751.00] P:1633.79 E:0.092990 |  that Senegal are able to clear it.
[5751.00 - 5754.00] P:1711.81 E:0.080050 |  Mendy was the player closest to it,
[5754.00 - 5756.00] P:1581.61 E:0.094671 |  and England go back all the way to Jordan Pickford.
[5756.00 - 5760.00] P:1618.77 E:0.092226 |  Just for the record, England's goal scorers now at this World Cup.
[5760.00 - 5763.00] P:1473.05 E:0.098611 |  Rashford and Saka have got three each,
[5763.00 - 5766.00] P:1293.49 E:0.123007 |  as the ball is played for to Rashford, but he won't reach that.
[5766.00 - 5772.00] P:1436.72 E:0.107799 |  The attendance is announced as 65,985.
[5773.00 - 5776.00] P:1139.36 E:0.112845 |  I'm not absolutely certain about that.
[5776.00 - 5779.00] P:1105.54 E:0.110027 |  There seem to be quite a lot of empty seats inside the stadium,
[5779.00 - 5781.00] P:1239.78 E:0.116992 |  but however, that is the official attendance,
[5781.00 - 5786.00] P:1297.30 E:0.103527 |  which is something like 3,000, 2,500 short of capacity,
[5786.00 - 5789.00] P:1619.85 E:0.100831 |  with Senegal winning a free kick inside their own half.
[5789.00 - 5791.00] P:1576.74 E:0.096485 |  So far for England at this World Cup,
[5791.00 - 5793.00] P:1723.15 E:0.102327 |  three goals for Rashford, three for Saka,
[5793.00 - 5795.00] P:1595.21 E:0.088642 |  and then one each for Bellingham, Stirling,
[5795.00 - 5797.00] P:1612.97 E:0.094023 |  Dreeleesh, Foulden, Henderson and Keane.
[5797.00 - 5800.00] P:1590.05 E:0.095403 |  I think it's brilliant that they're shared around,
[5800.00 - 5802.00] P:1391.50 E:0.091250 |  and we haven't got...
[5802.00 - 5804.00] P:1501.00 E:0.105973 |  I sent a forward, our main talisman,
[5804.00 - 5806.00] P:1684.91 E:0.094697 |  really firing in this tournament yet,
[5806.00 - 5809.00] P:1518.44 E:0.098062 |  but I think he's had a massive contribution, Harry Kane,
[5809.00 - 5813.00] P:1422.94 E:0.104732 |  in terms of assists and the way he's pulling defenders out of position
[5813.00 - 5816.00] P:1528.67 E:0.098605 |  to allow those players to get in where it hurts
[5816.00 - 5818.00] P:1514.09 E:0.090014 |  and the runs from midfield.
[5818.00 - 5822.00] P:1547.18 E:0.091673 |  I'm really excited about that, how our midfielders look so attacking.
[5822.00 - 5824.00] P:1497.21 E:0.100113 |  It's been a real positive from this game
[5824.00 - 5826.00] P:1439.28 E:0.092535 |  and other matches in the tournament.
[5826.00 - 5827.00] P:1536.06 E:0.120615 |  BBC Five Live,
[5827.00 - 5829.00] P:1516.16 E:0.093295 |  a listener as well via BBC Sounds.
[5829.00 - 5834.00] P:1606.03 E:0.093987 |  First test is back on Sports Extra in the early hours tomorrow.
[5834.00 - 5837.00] P:1545.63 E:0.098159 |  They said they were going to be watching this game tonight,
[5837.00 - 5839.00] P:1536.36 E:0.098351 |  and then tomorrow we'll have all the reaction,
[5839.00 - 5843.00] P:1642.79 E:0.094502 |  Five Live Breakfast, Rick Edwards is going to be in the Souq Wauquif
[5843.00 - 5846.00] P:1544.07 E:0.097916 |  in the morning again, and then two more commentaries tomorrow.
[5846.00 - 5851.00] P:1623.19 E:0.096142 |  Japan, Croatia and Brazil, South Korea from inside the stadiums.
[5851.00 - 5855.00] P:1681.55 E:0.096486 |  You know the drill by now, but here's Grealish for England.
[5855.00 - 5858.00] P:1681.35 E:0.080725 |  Grealish playing it back to Henderson,
[5858.00 - 5860.00] P:1498.83 E:0.117099 |  who whips a ball over the top.
[5860.00 - 5862.00] P:1738.81 E:0.095838 |  This is for Rashford to chase.
[5862.00 - 5865.00] P:1694.56 E:0.104728 |  Rashford across, Kane just couldn't get there on his left foot,
[5865.00 - 5867.00] P:1702.44 E:0.091007 |  went to ground, stretching the left foot,
[5867.00 - 5869.00] P:1646.24 E:0.087548 |  but couldn't make contact and Senegal clear.
[5869.00 - 5872.00] P:1551.38 E:0.099352 |  Absolutely love that move, what I've just seen from England.
[5872.00 - 5875.00] P:1539.31 E:0.101513 |  I love the fact that Jordan Henderson knows it's Marcus Rashford
[5875.00 - 5878.00] P:1600.14 E:0.101554 |  out on that right-hand side, and he didn't even look for that pass,
[5878.00 - 5883.00] P:1662.25 E:0.093101 |  John, it came to him, and he just flipped that round the corner over the top.
[5883.00 - 5886.00] P:1595.00 E:0.092585 |  Rashford's on his bike, first time crossed, across the box,
[5886.00 - 5891.00] P:1518.76 E:0.092281 |  about a penalty spot, and Harry Kane probably about a foot away from making contact.
[5891.00 - 5895.00] P:1586.99 E:0.093768 |  It would have been another super goal from England that happened out of nothing
[5895.00 - 5900.00] P:1527.45 E:0.093028 |  with real pace and precision, but that's what you get when Marcus Rashford plays wide.
[5900.00 - 5903.00] P:1507.34 E:0.102956 |  You know that spacing behind is where he wants the ball,
[5903.00 - 5907.00] P:1501.34 E:0.093848 |  more than having it to feet, like Foden does and like Saka does out there,
[5907.00 - 5910.00] P:1572.17 E:0.093823 |  and you can just spin it in behind for him.
[5910.00 - 5914.00] P:1598.45 E:0.094448 |  He's given away, given away to Rashford as well, and he's off and running.
[5914.00 - 5916.00] P:1622.28 E:0.086823 |  Senegal defenders trying to catch him,
[5916.00 - 5919.00] P:1390.73 E:0.100408 |  but he weaves back out to the right-hand side and plays it back into his own half.
[5919.00 - 5923.00] P:1610.10 E:0.095902 |  Harry Kane was really just what a matter of inches away
[5923.00 - 5926.00] P:1453.35 E:0.089970 |  from getting a touch on that in the middle of the goal.
[5926.00 - 5931.00] P:1626.35 E:0.080893 |  Calvin Phillips is waiting to come on, just off the pitch,
[5931.00 - 5936.00] P:1446.18 E:0.097064 |  on the halfway line in England with Shaw, back to Grealish, Brown Hair,
[5936.00 - 5939.00] P:1372.76 E:0.096280 |  swept back, Grealish passes the ball from foot to foot
[5939.00 - 5944.00] P:1445.16 E:0.092072 |  and then has his legs taken away from him by Bamber Dieng,
[5944.00 - 5947.00] P:1558.03 E:0.092868 |  and it's a free kick to England on the left-hand side,
[5947.00 - 5950.00] P:1449.21 E:0.085193 |  and just on Harry Kane, if you remember.
[5950.00 - 5952.00] P:1675.71 E:0.104177 |  So he's got 52 goals for England tonight,
[5952.00 - 5955.00] P:1393.96 E:0.104950 |  and we will hear from Ellen White incidentally a little bit later again,
[5955.00 - 5959.00] P:1587.71 E:0.097207 |  who herself has scored 52 goals for the England women's team,
[5959.00 - 5964.00] P:1738.40 E:0.106606 |  but Harry Kane, he didn't score in the group stages of the Euros last year,
[5964.00 - 5967.00] P:1789.51 E:0.094482 |  but scored four goals in the knockout stages.
[5967.00 - 5971.00] P:1697.10 E:0.104825 |  And it's Jordan Henderson who is going to leave the field.
[5971.00 - 5975.00] P:1392.55 E:0.104280 |  Harry scored the opening goal tonight, shortly before halftime,
[5975.00 - 5980.00] P:1381.51 E:0.106694 |  and he has, as they say in football, put in a shift this evening here.
[5980.00 - 5983.00] P:1378.81 E:0.116058 |  I mean, I think he's the one selection in the team
[5983.00 - 5987.00] P:1311.94 E:0.112211 |  that could have definitely been up for debate, but not after tonight.
[5987.00 - 5990.00] P:1384.85 E:0.092944 |  We saw the impact he had in the last game,
[5990.00 - 5996.00] P:1491.08 E:0.087445 |  but the midfield three in this match, for me, have been the standout performers.
[5996.00 - 5999.00] P:1560.44 E:0.103395 |  They've just been brilliant, both in and out of possession.
[5999.00 - 6003.00] P:1518.92 E:0.097032 |  I love the intensity, which they hunt the ball down together,
[6003.00 - 6009.00] P:1466.94 E:0.090468 |  the timing, the balance of Declan Rice just sitting in front of the two centre backs,
[6009.00 - 6013.00] P:1472.34 E:0.095192 |  and like what Greeny said, just timing when he wants to go out
[6013.00 - 6016.00] P:1246.31 E:0.091287 |  and win the ball or intercept to pass, and Henderson.
[6016.00 - 6019.00] P:1327.11 E:0.090168 |  I mean, how far, how many times has he got forwarded in the box, John?
[6019.00 - 6023.00] P:1479.96 E:0.097529 |  He's just been arriving in the box all the time, and to have the freedom to do that,
[6023.00 - 6026.00] P:1525.42 E:0.096426 |  knowing that Declan Rice is behind you,
[6026.00 - 6029.00] P:1266.74 E:0.095074 |  it's looked really good in that area of the pitch for England.
[6029.00 - 6033.00] P:1579.26 E:0.097571 |  England three, Senegal nil, so you can get out your permanent marker
[6033.00 - 6038.00] P:1430.66 E:0.081096 |  and write in France against England on Saturday night,
[6038.00 - 6044.00] P:1504.20 E:0.096462 |  so that's six days, another six-day gap now before England and France play again.
[6044.00 - 6048.00] P:1467.81 E:0.093060 |  So that is seven o'clock GMT, so seven o'clock in the UK
[6048.00 - 6053.00] P:1422.37 E:0.088487 |  in what will be the last of the quarter-finals on Saturday night.
[6053.00 - 6057.00] P:1459.47 E:0.095383 |  And you know, England will have to clearly think very carefully about France,
[6057.00 - 6060.00] P:1498.85 E:0.104500 |  but I think France will have to think very carefully about England.
[6060.00 - 6062.00] P:1462.42 E:0.077752 |  Absolutely, I really agree.
[6062.00 - 6065.00] P:1613.26 E:0.094270 |  I think that it's just such a fascinating match-up, isn't it?
[6065.00 - 6069.00] P:1357.77 E:0.100232 |  Massive game for this stage in the tournament as well, isn't it?
[6069.00 - 6072.00] P:1494.40 E:0.090372 |  I know it's a quarter-finals, but a huge game.
[6072.00 - 6077.00] P:1545.87 E:0.085286 |  Disappointment for Senegal that they weren't able to
[6077.00 - 6080.00] P:1575.40 E:0.094485 |  equal their best ever World Cup performance
[6080.00 - 6086.00] P:1569.06 E:0.093387 |  when they reached the quarter-finals at their very first World Cup in Japan and Korea.
[6086.00 - 6089.00] P:1531.47 E:0.095673 |  And the game really now is just being played out.
[6089.00 - 6091.00] P:1484.18 E:0.096421 |  Down to Rob Green again behind the goal.
[6091.00 - 6095.00] P:1581.51 E:0.098520 |  Yeah, just one looking around the stadium and talking about the Mexican way,
[6095.00 - 6098.00] P:1594.40 E:0.098752 |  but actually now the crowd is starting to go, they realise,
[6098.00 - 6102.00] P:1638.85 E:0.094894 |  for everyone who hasn't been out here, it's a good 45 minutes to an hour drive
[6102.00 - 6105.00] P:1678.26 E:0.097506 |  if you're driving John, 20 minutes for everyone else,
[6105.00 - 6108.00] P:1605.34 E:0.087824 |  but some distance out away from the Tirec town.
[6108.00 - 6112.00] P:1694.68 E:0.095822 |  And it's just that realisation, it's late in the evening,
[6112.00 - 6116.00] P:1557.86 E:0.083236 |  we've got to get home and I think they know that this is done.
[6116.00 - 6119.00] P:1570.19 E:0.090049 |  I noticed that, by the way, I didn't miss it.
[6119.00 - 6122.00] P:1546.68 E:0.101087 |  As Senegal play the ball through the middle,
[6122.00 - 6125.00] P:1619.07 E:0.090084 |  England will want another clean sheet if they can.
[6125.00 - 6128.00] P:1582.35 E:0.108183 |  They've got a ball from Jacobs into the England penalty area,
[6128.00 - 6132.00] P:1631.31 E:0.088622 |  but it's headed up and over the top, seven or eight yards out,
[6132.00 - 6136.00] P:1463.80 E:0.091119 |  centre of the goal, but didn't threaten Jordan Picklitz,
[6136.00 - 6138.00] P:1269.31 E:0.097204 |  and he was able to watch it go over the top.
[6138.00 - 6144.00] P:1459.70 E:0.095616 |  And Senegal now making what will be their 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th change, their final change.
[6144.00 - 6148.00] P:1553.53 E:0.091748 |  And it's the left back, Jacobs, who is coming up,
[6148.00 - 6154.00] P:1407.08 E:0.095760 |  and he's being replaced by Fodo Ballotourain of AC Milan,
[6154.00 - 6157.00] P:1335.39 E:0.107065 |  who will go over that to the far side, so it's a straight swap.
[6157.00 - 6159.00] P:1209.87 E:0.112426 |  He has a little chance there though for Sar, wasn't he?
[6159.00 - 6163.00] P:1212.72 E:0.111350 |  Just moving himself between Dyer and McGuire,
[6163.00 - 6166.00] P:1274.65 E:0.107627 |  no real contact on him, he gets up, it's not particularly good head,
[6166.00 - 6169.00] P:1322.43 E:0.115576 |  it didn't look that confident like he was going to win the ball
[6169.00 - 6173.00] P:1496.18 E:0.094741 |  and punch that header underneath the crossbar.
[6173.00 - 6176.00] P:1530.71 E:0.095747 |  But I think England and Jordan Pickford, especially,
[6176.00 - 6179.00] P:1670.71 E:0.100175 |  are really pushing hard for a clean sheet,
[6179.00 - 6185.00] P:1514.52 E:0.098933 |  being another really good element of the performance to keep a clean sheet,
[6185.00 - 6188.00] P:1391.82 E:0.105708 |  and you get to this stage of the game as a centre back and a goalkeeper,
[6188.00 - 6190.00] P:1388.99 E:0.089230 |  and that is really what you're scrapping for.
[6190.00 - 6192.00] P:1425.28 E:0.103105 |  But for pride more than anything, John,
[6192.00 - 6196.00] P:1510.54 E:0.086567 |  that feeling of a clean sheet is what you base your game on.
[6196.00 - 6202.00] P:1547.41 E:0.095424 |  So England 3-0 up, Pickford, left footed, long downfield,
[6202.00 - 6207.00] P:1472.75 E:0.088885 |  grilishing with the challenge, but Senegal are able to play it away from the back.
[6207.00 - 6211.00] P:1589.43 E:0.098895 |  So I wonder who will be put forward for interview this evening.
[6211.00 - 6214.00] P:1571.28 E:0.096797 |  Clearly we'll talk to Gareth Southgate in the hour after this match,
[6214.00 - 6220.00] P:1448.93 E:0.095409 |  but you can pick almost any of these England players out to talk about this performance this evening.
[6220.00 - 6223.00] P:1296.64 E:0.100634 |  It has been a memorable one for them.
[6223.00 - 6227.00] P:1402.90 E:0.102108 |  It's not every day you win a knockout match at the World Cup by 3 goals to 0.
[6227.00 - 6233.00] P:1485.12 E:0.095970 |  No, and I think that tells you about the capabilities as well, doesn't it, of this squad.
[6233.00 - 6237.00] P:1451.07 E:0.097887 |  Because the first half it wasn't the best performance in England in,
[6237.00 - 6241.00] P:1444.07 E:0.095129 |  there were a lot of elements that they would have liked to have had better.
[6241.00 - 6246.00] P:1590.80 E:0.103317 |  As Grealish plays it forward to Cain, who tried to flick the ball with his heel over the top of his head
[6246.00 - 6249.00] P:1289.81 E:0.096230 |  because it was slightly behind him that Senegal were able to put in the challenge,
[6249.00 - 6252.00] P:1445.26 E:0.092736 |  and then that's actually a foul by Mount, centrefield, so it's a free kick.
[6252.00 - 6254.00] P:1412.58 E:0.095597 |  Still no yellow card.
[6254.00 - 6257.00] P:1536.13 E:0.096411 |  That was quite a blatant hack down for a Mason mount.
[6257.00 - 6259.00] P:1579.39 E:0.111052 |  Nowhere near the ball, I'll just trip him up,
[6259.00 - 6261.00] P:1388.72 E:0.098928 |  and the referee just kind of runs off going,
[6261.00 - 6265.00] P:1366.34 E:0.092857 |  okay, it's a foul, doesn't appear to want to book anyone.
[6265.00 - 6269.00] P:1586.86 E:0.102096 |  Here, Savoli down the right, only Coulis-Valliers received the yellow card this evening.
[6269.00 - 6272.00] P:1581.96 E:0.088659 |  Savoli onto his right foot, across comes the cross,
[6272.00 - 6276.00] P:1458.29 E:0.098051 |  but onto the head of Maguire, who heads it out of play on the right-hand side.
[6276.00 - 6280.00] P:1460.09 E:0.089486 |  And with England not yet collecting any yellow cards tonight,
[6280.00 - 6284.00] P:1597.92 E:0.104095 |  as it's brought in from the right-hand side by Pat Gay, who shoots,
[6284.00 - 6288.00] P:1488.53 E:0.093826 |  and I think he was caught as he, just as he hit the ball, the challenge came in late,
[6288.00 - 6291.00] P:1390.63 E:0.095834 |  and that's another free kick for Senegal.
[6291.00 - 6293.00] P:1303.54 E:0.096527 |  Yeah, similar area.
[6293.00 - 6296.00] P:1493.26 E:0.090702 |  I think it's Lucho, it might even be Harry Maguire.
[6296.00 - 6301.00] P:1595.36 E:0.094017 |  Yeah, Harry Maguire possibly just comes out and just contacts him,
[6301.00 - 6303.00] P:1419.25 E:0.098277 |  and it's really similar.
[6303.00 - 6305.00] P:1537.00 E:0.101641 |  It's actually gone out for a corner, and they've taken it quickly.
[6305.00 - 6307.00] P:1512.27 E:0.101486 |  They've given us a corner over on the left-hand side.
[6307.00 - 6309.00] P:1677.80 E:0.094586 |  Here comes the cross, pick the come straight,
[6309.00 - 6312.00] P:1716.50 E:0.099389 |  and catches it comfortably on the edge of his six-yard box,
[6312.00 - 6316.00] P:1603.04 E:0.092273 |  and then holds the pause, and takes three or four steps out beyond the penalty spot,
[6316.00 - 6319.00] P:1527.15 E:0.097149 |  and then just calms everyone down and over-arms it out.
[6319.00 - 6321.00] P:1697.57 E:0.088469 |  And there are three minutes to play,
[6321.00 - 6328.00] P:1465.22 E:0.092521 |  three minutes before England's place in the quarter-finals at this World Cup is confirmed.
[6328.00 - 6332.00] P:1547.17 E:0.083862 |  So that is the next step for England, finished top of the group,
[6332.00 - 6336.00] P:1530.99 E:0.096811 |  and now into the quarter-finals, just like at the World Cup four years ago,
[6336.00 - 6338.00] P:1596.33 E:0.101904 |  just like at the Euros last year.
[6338.00 - 6341.00] P:1471.57 E:0.098331 |  Yeah, you can really start to see the stadium empty out now.
[6342.00 - 6345.00] P:1492.77 E:0.105004 |  The fans are fully aware of the situation.
[6345.00 - 6347.00] P:1258.09 E:0.100192 |  There's quite a few England fans still here,
[6347.00 - 6351.00] P:1431.33 E:0.090989 |  but big pockets of seats available, and quite rightly,
[6351.00 - 6353.00] P:1524.44 E:0.111410 |  the game's been done for some time, hasn't it?
[6353.00 - 6357.00] P:1507.17 E:0.096421 |  As soon as that third goal went in, England in full control.
[6357.00 - 6362.00] P:1570.28 E:0.093722 |  There's Declan Rice, just knocks the ball forward into the Senegal half.
[6362.00 - 6367.00] P:1647.04 E:0.091216 |  Rashford chases it, but Mendy is able to get his right foot to it.
[6367.00 - 6369.00] P:1609.73 E:0.097156 |  Long before Rashford got there in England,
[6369.00 - 6371.00] P:1427.42 E:0.089971 |  they've got it down inside their own half again.
[6371.00 - 6375.00] P:1488.30 E:0.100205 |  Calvin Phillips, who came on as a substitute against Wales,
[6375.00 - 6378.00] P:1351.76 E:0.089059 |  so a little more game time for him.
[6378.00 - 6382.00] P:1462.23 E:0.102718 |  Phillips passing it forward, and actually that's a poor pass straight out of play on the half-way line.
[6382.00 - 6386.00] P:1514.68 E:0.090123 |  Yeah, with the yellow cards, they are wiped after the quarter-finals.
[6386.00 - 6391.00] P:1392.30 E:0.091594 |  So, you know, with England not picking up any yellow cards in this match either,
[6391.00 - 6395.00] P:1395.72 E:0.098981 |  you know, that wipes out the possibility of an England player,
[6395.00 - 6397.00] P:1295.88 E:0.101670 |  unless there's a red card in the quarter-finals,
[6397.00 - 6400.00] P:1515.67 E:0.094803 |  that's being suspended for a potential semi.
[6400.00 - 6403.00] P:1384.80 E:0.104819 |  Although we might be looking too far ahead of ourselves there, Matt.
[6403.00 - 6405.00] P:1409.49 E:0.094501 |  Yeah, let's calm down, John.
[6405.00 - 6409.00] P:1367.29 E:0.095882 |  Let's just enjoy this moment, think about the next game.
[6409.00 - 6416.00] P:1423.81 E:0.093464 |  But, you know, England haven't played in a way that isn't high-press or high-intensity.
[6416.00 - 6418.00] P:1430.65 E:0.101039 |  They've been on the front foot in quite a lot of occasions,
[6418.00 - 6421.00] P:1396.82 E:0.104901 |  especially in that midfield area, there's balls popping about all over the place,
[6421.00 - 6426.00] P:1445.14 E:0.095178 |  and it just shows you how measured they've been in terms of their decision-making.
[6426.00 - 6430.00] P:1495.13 E:0.101413 |  It's not easy to go this many games in a tournament in modern-day football
[6430.00 - 6432.00] P:1607.32 E:0.085015 |  and not pick up a yellow card.
[6432.00 - 6435.00] P:1557.47 E:0.101122 |  England 3-0 up, it's Senegal on the attack again, and once again,
[6435.00 - 6437.00] P:1593.41 E:0.101183 |  it's down the right-hand side, and it's pulled across.
[6437.00 - 6442.00] P:1676.70 E:0.104438 |  Orbus Bancers-Dessar on the edge of the box, I think he's going to let it run for the shot
[6442.00 - 6445.00] P:1554.76 E:0.102059 |  from the edge of the penalty area, and he might even,
[6445.00 - 6450.00] P:1638.79 E:0.090489 |  might easily have taken it on himself, because the shot when it came in,
[6450.00 - 6458.00] P:1551.05 E:0.087642 |  right-footed from the arriving Papsar, was wild and high,
[6458.00 - 6462.00] P:1543.41 E:0.090020 |  and it's behind, and it is a goal-hick for England.
[6462.00 - 6466.00] P:1471.43 E:0.094962 |  That was a nice 1-2 with Sabley, the right back,
[6466.00 - 6470.00] P:1624.52 E:0.098912 |  that did a 1-2 round, Jack Grealish, and put a good cross into the box.
[6470.00 - 6473.00] P:1369.49 E:0.091992 |  He's had a lot of energy, Sabley, and right back.
[6473.00 - 6475.00] P:1212.51 E:0.104564 |  He's had a decent game, it's not been easy for him,
[6475.00 - 6478.00] P:1451.48 E:0.094778 |  but they've got good full-backs that like to get forward.
[6478.00 - 6482.00] P:1426.83 E:0.088924 |  We're in the 90th minute now, as Jordan Pickford takes this goal-kick,
[6482.00 - 6485.00] P:1465.64 E:0.093760 |  and it comes back at the England defence, Eric Dyer, with a touch,
[6485.00 - 6491.00] P:1532.38 E:0.094822 |  then Walker, I think will pass it back, by a Dyer, to Pickford in the goal.
[6491.00 - 6494.00] P:1541.91 E:0.107154 |  So back down to pitchside and Rob Green again.
[6494.00 - 6499.00] P:1612.71 E:0.106772 |  Yeah, just a funny moment there, where you said about Jordan Pickford holding the pose
[6499.00 - 6503.00] P:1589.13 E:0.091514 |  as he caught the cross, and that's something that Martin Marketson,
[6503.00 - 6506.00] P:1619.20 E:0.109865 |  the goalkeeper, coaching, and preaches day after day.
[6506.00 - 6510.00] P:1499.96 E:0.101657 |  When you catch it, keep the ball up in the air, and he did that,
[6510.00 - 6515.00] P:1601.97 E:0.101792 |  and it just had a little glance over, and I saw the goalkeeper coach fist pumping,
[6515.00 - 6518.00] P:1533.30 E:0.119928 |  clapping, they're 3-0 up with 2 minutes to go.
[6518.00 - 6521.00] P:1502.00 E:0.109749 |  It still means everything to a goalkeeper.
[6521.00 - 6523.00] P:1263.31 E:0.113479 |  Brilliant inside, Rob, thanks for that.
[6523.00 - 6526.00] P:1436.69 E:0.106805 |  Phillips playing the ball to Grealish on the left-hand side,
[6526.00 - 6530.00] P:1480.53 E:0.102584 |  Grealish now finding Shaw on the left in the box,
[6530.00 - 6534.00] P:1713.68 E:0.103380 |  Shaw chips it right across to the back post, Rashford stretching.
[6534.00 - 6537.00] P:1615.97 E:0.100184 |  Defender was there with him, actually, followed to a race,
[6537.00 - 6541.00] P:1365.97 E:0.101558 |  so he was only able to help it into the outside netting and behind goal kick.
[6541.00 - 6546.00] P:1317.12 E:0.102311 |  Yeah, probably wasn't the easiest of things to score from.
[6546.00 - 6548.00] P:1587.91 E:0.105304 |  Luke Shaw really chips that ball to the far post,
[6548.00 - 6552.00] P:1490.05 E:0.103588 |  but Marcus Rashford's a little bit too far outside of the goal.
[6552.00 - 6554.00] P:1569.05 E:0.116899 |  I mean, he really is straining for that, John,
[6554.00 - 6558.00] P:1567.79 E:0.105623 |  as you can tell he wants that goal just to keep in touch with him back there.
[6558.00 - 6560.00] P:1543.50 E:0.105004 |  It's a brilliant situation for him if he does get a goal
[6560.00 - 6564.00] P:1439.43 E:0.097956 |  to be one behind him at this stage of the tournament.
[6566.00 - 6568.00] P:1430.38 E:0.112089 |  So, Saniagal began to play it out from the back.
[6568.00 - 6570.00] P:1598.64 E:0.086216 |  4 minutes about a time.
[6570.00 - 6572.00] P:1321.96 E:0.096007 |  We're into that now.
[6572.00 - 6574.00] P:1442.87 E:0.086228 |  So, England will want that clean sheet.
[6574.00 - 6577.00] P:1584.62 E:0.099909 |  That would be 3 in a row at this tournament.
[6577.00 - 6579.00] P:1499.03 E:0.094924 |  By the way, I know that people will again.
[6579.00 - 6583.00] P:1493.08 E:0.100208 |  I'm sure they will talk about the level of the opposition England have played.
[6583.00 - 6586.00] P:1496.33 E:0.093610 |  It's a long pass as played for Saniagal,
[6586.00 - 6588.00] P:1507.98 E:0.107409 |  but Shaw is able to head it away, rice is after it.
[6588.00 - 6590.00] P:1459.20 E:0.097067 |  Now, that was a foul.
[6590.00 - 6592.00] P:1449.20 E:0.099177 |  That was a clear foul on Banba Jiang,
[6592.00 - 6595.00] P:1561.18 E:0.097954 |  and that might be a yellow card for rice.
[6595.00 - 6598.00] P:1479.03 E:0.094671 |  The referee is just walking across,
[6598.00 - 6602.00] P:1563.16 E:0.093424 |  but no, they take a quick free kick and it's not a yellow card.
[6602.00 - 6604.00] P:1549.95 E:0.091472 |  I think he's hurt himself a little bit there, though,
[6604.00 - 6605.00] P:1389.17 E:0.087398 |  Declan Rice.
[6605.00 - 6609.00] P:1423.27 E:0.084193 |  He just kicked the bottom of the boot,
[6609.00 - 6613.00] P:1518.49 E:0.086841 |  and it looks like he's just pulled up.
[6613.00 - 6616.00] P:1263.98 E:0.112922 |  He kicked the studs, and it can be a little bit sore, that one.
[6616.00 - 6618.00] P:1616.41 E:0.104146 |  Jack Grealish, you just tried to offload the ball,
[6618.00 - 6620.00] P:1458.15 E:0.104504 |  but got it a little bit wrong and put Declan Rice
[6620.00 - 6624.00] P:1497.51 E:0.095558 |  in a bit of a difficult situation where he had to go for the ball.
[6624.00 - 6626.00] P:1516.45 E:0.112226 |  It was Banba Jiang, wasn't it?
[6626.00 - 6628.00] P:1431.20 E:0.089164 |  He's boot he kicked.
[6628.00 - 6631.00] P:1285.39 E:0.102680 |  So, he's now Declan Rice, part of the England wall,
[6631.00 - 6634.00] P:1637.52 E:0.089642 |  wall of four, plus Rashford just off the right side of it.
[6634.00 - 6638.00] P:1519.69 E:0.090593 |  I think it's going to be Banba Jiang himself who's going to take this.
[6640.00 - 6643.00] P:1665.24 E:0.107040 |  Saniagal, heading for defeat, heading for a World Cup exit.
[6643.00 - 6648.00] P:1567.62 E:0.093094 |  But an opportunity here from the free kick, from a right-sided position,
[6648.00 - 6653.00] P:1497.13 E:0.094367 |  25 yards out, and it is Banba Jiang who hits it straight into the wall
[6653.00 - 6657.00] P:1488.09 E:0.090831 |  and it bounces away out of play for throwing to Saniagal down to our right.
[6657.00 - 6663.00] P:1436.80 E:0.098235 |  Just in front of their brilliant supporters, we'll not forget them still dancing and swaying
[6663.00 - 6669.00] P:1621.80 E:0.090746 |  from right to left, to right to left, as Saniagal win a corner
[6669.00 - 6671.00] P:1534.79 E:0.099837 |  late on in the match, in added time.
[6671.00 - 6674.00] P:1442.06 E:0.090041 |  So England will have to defend this set piece.
[6677.00 - 6684.00] P:1380.13 E:0.099404 |  It's going to be taken by Papsar, the number 17, the top man, the 20-year-old.
[6684.00 - 6690.00] P:1490.14 E:0.091918 |  He's ready, just moving from foot to foot, almost to the rhythm of the Saniagalese drummers.
[6690.00 - 6693.00] P:1496.97 E:0.104523 |  And it comes to the near post from him, but cleared away,
[6693.00 - 6697.00] P:1550.65 E:0.090289 |  gruelish stretches for it, that Saniagal have it back again.
[6697.00 - 6702.00] P:1459.97 E:0.092449 |  But Rashford, nearly nipped that away from Nampales-Mendi,
[6702.00 - 6707.00] P:1316.08 E:0.098633 |  Saniagal out to the left-hand side, lots and lots of empty red seats now around the ground.
[6707.00 - 6711.00] P:1377.59 E:0.095143 |  People knowing that the match is over, England are going through,
[6711.00 - 6715.00] P:1318.90 E:0.100478 |  and Saniagal just knocking it around inside their own half.
[6715.00 - 6719.00] P:1529.08 E:0.090503 |  So England at this World Cup now, so long passes forward,
[6719.00 - 6723.00] P:1346.21 E:0.106049 |  but Walker's headed back actually, and under pressure, has headed it behind,
[6723.00 - 6725.00] P:1404.66 E:0.098223 |  and it is a Saniagal corner.
[6725.00 - 6728.00] P:1446.06 E:0.093319 |  So he's moving with that, Karl Walker, disappointed.
[6728.00 - 6734.00] P:1518.88 E:0.100075 |  Didn't get the contact on the header, just needed to punch that back into the hands of Jordan Pickford instead.
[6734.00 - 6738.00] P:1563.56 E:0.108017 |  It's a bit of a tentative header, wasn't too sure, and he puts it out for a corner,
[6738.00 - 6743.00] P:1547.30 E:0.093702 |  and England have to defend this now, and they'll be desperate to keep hold of this clean sheet.
[6743.00 - 6747.00] P:1531.93 E:0.106189 |  So a corner from the left, Saniagal to take this right foot in,
[6747.00 - 6752.00] P:1482.97 E:0.096642 |  into the edge of the six-yard box, McGuire heads it into possibly one of his own men,
[6752.00 - 6758.00] P:1560.58 E:0.089599 |  deflects back out to the left-hand side, Saar, then into the corner of the box.
[6758.00 - 6763.00] P:1602.07 E:0.103976 |  Ballotourez crossed, that's blocked, and it's out of play again for another throw on the far side.
[6763.00 - 6765.00] P:1717.08 E:0.117790 |  And that's it.
[6765.00 - 6770.00] P:1799.93 E:0.112874 |  There is no more time, and the referee blows the whistle,
[6770.00 - 6777.00] P:1676.34 E:0.108204 |  and England are through to the quarter-finals of the World Cup, here in Katak in 2022,
[6777.00 - 6783.00] P:1376.88 E:0.111566 |  with a very comfortable victory in the end, by three goals to nil over Saniagal,
[6783.00 - 6787.00] P:1269.73 E:0.105869 |  and at times they've been very, very impressive.
[6787.00 - 6788.00] P:1228.55 E:0.099193 |  Matt Upsett.
[6788.00 - 6792.00] P:1507.51 E:0.111120 |  Yeah, super impressive, super confident in this second half, especially.
[6792.00 - 6797.00] P:1299.84 E:0.103181 |  Little bit troubled in the first half, was a little bit concerned, I have to say,
[6797.00 - 6802.00] P:1424.84 E:0.105068 |  until the first goal went in, but you just felt that when it was going to click for England,
[6802.00 - 6806.00] P:1461.96 E:0.100605 |  and when they were going to go through the gears, and the quality, and the passing,
[6806.00 - 6812.00] P:1512.72 E:0.095985 |  and the movement was all going to come together, they were going to pull this Senegalese team apart,
[6812.00 - 6818.00] P:1526.37 E:0.091465 |  this stubborn Senegalese team, who physically and tactically actually set up pretty well for the game,
[6818.00 - 6823.00] P:1712.78 E:0.094305 |  but the moment that first goal went in, and then the second, England went into cruise control,
[6823.00 - 6828.00] P:1626.88 E:0.096179 |  and were very, very confident, massive parts of that second half, was super comfortable,
[6828.00 - 6834.00] P:1858.82 E:0.103642 |  not particularly competitive, and I just think Senegal found it really hard to try and drive themselves back into this game,
[6834.00 - 6837.00] P:1829.54 E:0.114836 |  but a lot of positive for England, and a really solid win.
[6837.00 - 6841.00] P:1791.84 E:0.094738 |  Yeah, thank you, Matt, much more to come, all the reaction at this World Cup.
[6841.00 - 6847.00] P:1781.31 E:0.097107 |  England have got past in the group, the teams ranked 20th, 19th, and 16th in the world.
[6847.00 - 6854.00] P:1785.88 E:0.101167 |  They've now knocked out the world ranked number 18 team with these goals from Henderson, Kane and Saka,
[6854.00 - 6859.00] P:1754.82 E:0.082214 |  but next in the quarter-final, it's the World Champions France,
[6859.00 - 6867.00] P:1691.17 E:0.088692 |  but they can enjoy the moment here at Alpete, after England 3, Senegal, Nill, and Mark Chapman's here with us.
[6868.00 - 6874.00] P:1727.74 E:0.100231 |  John, for the moment, thank you, so Matt Upsson, Michael Richards, and Rob Green down pitchside with us.
[6874.00 - 6878.00] P:1794.02 E:0.111081 |  We'll talk to Ellen White very shortly as well, we'll bring you reaction,
[6878.00 - 6883.00] P:1739.23 E:0.099332 |  and we'll get a thought from France as well ahead of that quarter-final,
[6883.00 - 6889.00] P:1671.25 E:0.108557 |  which will be next Saturday evening, but Rob Green, the players are moving in your direction.
[6890.00 - 6894.00] P:1852.79 E:0.107803 |  Yeah, they're just wondering down in front, this huge bank of England fans,
[6894.00 - 6901.00] P:1650.60 E:0.108583 |  what you would say would probably be the England fans that have travelled from England and made themselves at home here,
[6901.00 - 6906.00] P:1720.83 E:0.114668 |  and it really has been a performance that brought joy to them in the second half,
[6906.00 - 6910.00] P:1817.59 E:0.113574 |  in particular that period of half an hour, where they're just electric,
[6910.00 - 6916.00] P:1813.93 E:0.097713 |  and every single one of them going over, taking their flaws and ourselves, Gait,
[6916.00 - 6920.00] P:1790.37 E:0.110973 |  just a quick clap and moving on to be an interviewer, he knows he's got work to do,
[6920.00 - 6927.00] P:1811.28 E:0.090047 |  and must be so pleased with that performance because it did really purr at times, didn't it?
[6928.00 - 6932.00] P:1804.08 E:0.110140 |  It did, and in fact, they're not going overboard, are they, Michael, there,
[6932.00 - 6935.00] P:1810.51 E:0.093101 |  it's just a very much a job done, it feels like.
[6935.00 - 6939.00] P:1838.07 E:0.105680 |  No, I'll probably say it's a little bit more than that.
[6939.00 - 6943.00] P:1808.18 E:0.105031 |  Having seen all the teams in the World Cup now, chapters,
[6943.00 - 6949.00] P:1861.80 E:0.107816 |  the first half wasn't great, and we've seen England play like that at times in the tournament,
[6949.00 - 6954.00] P:1825.94 E:0.104824 |  but I actually believe England have got a chance of winning the World Cup now,
[6954.00 - 6958.00] P:1897.39 E:0.103862 |  because when they were going through a difficult moment, they got past that,
[6958.00 - 6963.00] P:1875.48 E:0.101708 |  and then they had the quality to move, yes, France are going to be a better position than Senegal,
[6963.00 - 6967.00] P:1900.42 E:0.097865 |  we all know that, but at times, I was watching France's game today,
[6967.00 - 6975.00] P:1865.62 E:0.095237 |  and they're not great defensively, and our forward-thinking players have been outstanding throughout the tournament,
[6975.00 - 6980.00] P:1777.03 E:0.094798 |  and if they can replicate somehow that performance against France,
[6980.00 - 6984.00] P:1821.23 E:0.089412 |  they've got a real chance of beating them, as Michael gone early.
[6984.00 - 6986.00] P:1756.36 E:0.122781 |  Oh, steady, Michael.
[6986.00 - 6997.00] P:1797.51 E:0.097987 |  I've been negative Nigel on England, because I said we've not really played anyone just yet,
[6997.00 - 7001.00] P:1775.15 E:0.102836 |  and Senegal, coming into this game, I thought, how are we going to play?
[7001.00 - 7006.00] P:1859.78 E:0.092345 |  When we played against USA, they was physical, they was quick, they was dynamic,
[7006.00 - 7013.00] P:1847.19 E:0.100709 |  and coming up against a strong and fast Senegalese team, OK, they admittedly had a few injuries,
[7013.00 - 7019.00] P:1894.09 E:0.100577 |  but I'm looking at the whole tournament in terms of squads, I think England have a real chance,
[7019.00 - 7022.00] P:1926.17 E:0.082955 |  I'm not saying they're going to win it, but I think they have a chance.
[7022.00 - 7032.00] P:1805.01 E:0.099638 |  Do you feel that we need to maybe get a goal, or that we don't start matches with that belief level that we finish it with?
[7032.00 - 7038.00] P:1768.36 E:0.100120 |  For me, it's the key, because you're going to come up against France, and if you aren't at it from that moment,
[7038.00 - 7043.00] P:1674.56 E:0.106150 |  or if you're not playing with that swagger and arrogance that we're better than them, right from the off,
[7043.00 - 7050.00] P:1669.02 E:0.104041 |  you can find yourself in trouble, and then it never comes in the game, it's almost like we build into that feeling,
[7050.00 - 7058.00] P:1651.84 E:0.110098 |  and you just want that group of players to take performances like this today, and take it, how we've finished, into the start of the next game.
[7058.00 - 7066.00] P:1661.91 E:0.104934 |  Then you've got a game, and then I'll sit here and go, and I'll join you, Micah, and say, England are going to win the World Cup.
[7066.00 - 7069.00] P:1922.82 E:0.103889 |  No, no, no, no, no, I don't think I said they've got a chance.
[7069.00 - 7075.00] P:1840.91 E:0.104433 |  I don't want to be quoting saying, you know, the VORNE are they going to, they've got a real good chance.
[7075.00 - 7076.00] P:1605.09 E:0.059980 |  Yeah.
[7076.00 - 7078.00] P:1898.86 E:0.082252 |  Rob?
[7078.00 - 7085.00] P:1856.87 E:0.098394 |  Yeah, I think you're looking at, I think it wasn't convincing at the start, I do think that Senegal did have a game plan,
[7085.00 - 7092.00] P:1856.42 E:0.093267 |  and it implemented it well at the start, but I think Garret Southgate all be pleased in the fact that they rode through that difficult period,
[7092.00 - 7099.00] P:1809.62 E:0.105303 |  and he came out and sort of raised a few eyebrows about his response into the USA game, which was pretty tepid,
[7099.00 - 7103.00] P:1779.68 E:0.108388 |  and he said, no, I was pleased with it because we're not going to be flying all the time.
[7103.00 - 7106.00] P:1821.44 E:0.101442 |  They weren't flying at the start of this game, but found a way.
[7106.00 - 7111.00] P:1773.02 E:0.097767 |  And so, you know, I think, yeah, looking at that and saying it's a really, really good performance,
[7111.00 - 7115.00] P:1874.69 E:0.095107 |  because they rode through the difficulties in there.
[7115.00 - 7118.00] P:1942.97 E:0.104339 |  Michael, I've just stopped up saying they've got a chance.
[7118.00 - 7123.00] P:1797.34 E:0.092651 |  Is it now about approximately a 1 in 8 chance?
[7123.00 - 7125.00] P:1900.31 E:0.107608 |  I think it's a little bit stronger.
[7125.00 - 7132.00] P:1810.53 E:0.093225 |  I just hoped that France didn't come next, because the way Killing and Baput played today, wow.
[7132.00 - 7135.00] P:1876.82 E:0.096962 |  But look at the players we've got.
[7135.00 - 7140.00] P:1861.50 E:0.100064 |  I think with England, we always think about the other team, and Baput is special, but look how many...
[7140.00 - 7145.00] P:1762.11 E:0.092241 |  great attacking options we have with a start off from the bench.
[7145.00 - 7154.00] P:1669.48 E:0.089802 |  I just want to jump in, because the Senegal fans are still moving and swaying down there,
[7154.00 - 7160.00] P:1607.93 E:0.106325 |  and they're only now starting to think about leaving, and the Senegal players were applauded to a man
[7160.00 - 7168.00] P:1690.47 E:0.097899 |  by those Senegal fans after going out of this World Cup, and they have been one of the highlights of those Senegal fans.
[7168.00 - 7175.00] P:1554.03 E:0.090638 |  Their country goes home, but they have contributed massively to this World Cup.
[7175.00 - 7179.00] P:1671.56 E:0.092578 |  Michael's point, Rob, is fair there, isn't it?
[7179.00 - 7181.00] P:1838.77 E:0.103137 |  What, they've got a 1 in 8 chance?
[7181.00 - 7185.00] P:1748.33 E:0.093311 |  No, no, no, that was your point, I think.
[7185.00 - 7192.00] P:1706.12 E:0.092132 |  France have Killing and Baput, but of those goals that England scored tonight,
[7192.00 - 7199.00] P:1703.07 E:0.093141 |  it's difficult to think, I mean the Dutch scored a fantastic team goal against the USA yesterday, afternoon,
[7199.00 - 7207.00] P:1614.16 E:0.095285 |  but it's difficult to think of many better team goals at this World Cup, than the ones that England have scored this evening.
[7207.00 - 7212.00] P:1746.19 E:0.101479 |  When they got it right, it was electric, and there was times when there was a chance,
[7212.00 - 7216.00] P:1753.40 E:0.090893 |  which Matt described brilliantly, where Harry Kane just missed it,
[7216.00 - 7222.00] P:1688.57 E:0.106338 |  but the instinctive nature of the movement of the place, the speed, and when you pitch side, you realise,
[7222.00 - 7226.00] P:1689.99 E:0.100017 |  and when you're in it, you know it's fast, but I've been out the game for a couple of years now,
[7226.00 - 7232.00] P:1724.47 E:0.102624 |  and you forget how quick it is when they get it right, and it was just so fast,
[7232.00 - 7238.00] P:1749.49 E:0.099876 |  they're so quick in the mind, so quick in the body, and everything, when it gets in sync,
[7238.00 - 7245.00] P:1582.28 E:0.103989 |  you can't do anything to stop it, no one can, there's no team, there's no players in the world
[7245.00 - 7249.00] P:1840.67 E:0.083170 |  that can stop it, because it's just so fast.
[7249.00 - 7257.00] P:1720.43 E:0.088906 |  I mean this in a really respectful way Rob, but didn't every game look quick, from your perspective as a goalkeeper?
[7257.00 - 7260.00] P:1737.32 E:0.097441 |  And they got quicker, that's why I retired.
[7260.00 - 7273.00] P:1758.00 E:0.093222 |  You just come up against teams, you come up against anything, if they click, if they get the bits where they get it right,
[7273.00 - 7280.00] P:1808.28 E:0.101182 |  then you really are going to struggle at times, because you're just, you know, we played against the invincible side of Arsenal,
[7280.00 - 7288.00] P:1790.37 E:0.102250 |  and you stood there going, there's nothing we can do at times, because they're just more skillful, quicker, more powerful in those first few yards,
[7288.00 - 7292.00] P:1744.48 E:0.109143 |  and you watch this England team against the side, and that's when the Jeopardy went out in the game,
[7292.00 - 7298.00] P:1712.08 E:0.100472 |  because Senegal knew there is nothing we can do, they did it with Jub Belling, there's nothing we can do to stop them,
[7298.00 - 7308.00] P:1722.54 E:0.098317 |  and that's when you realise how fast, and how you just appreciate, what is it, they're saying, power is nothing without control,
[7308.00 - 7311.00] P:1676.83 E:0.095588 |  where you can implement the skill with it at such pace?
[7311.00 - 7320.00] P:1655.24 E:0.099241 |  I think also, Greeny, we can talk about the movement of the players, but a lot of that speed comes from the decisiveness, doesn't it?
[7320.00 - 7328.00] P:1722.17 E:0.095904 |  And one touch, like the ball from Henderson on that chance for Harry Kane, he didn't even look, he didn't have a touch, he just went bang,
[7328.00 - 7335.00] P:1787.53 E:0.093414 |  he just do it, it's so instinctive, Marcus Rashford, he's already gone, he's already running, it's a one touch cross, you can't defend that,
[7335.00 - 7341.00] P:1703.03 E:0.100622 |  it's like you're not going to be able to get back in position quick enough to deal with that, if the runs right,
[7341.00 - 7348.00] P:1637.52 E:0.105226 |  and I think there was two, well probably more than that, four or five moves in this game, that would have pulled anyone apart,
[7348.00 - 7352.00] P:1577.65 E:0.087407 |  and I think that's the real positive from this performance to see.
[7352.00 - 7358.00] P:1818.73 E:0.098259 |  Rob, if there was one thing that would concern you before we let you go, what would it be?
[7358.00 - 7367.00] P:1682.31 E:0.098548 |  I think, as you said, that opening 15-20 minutes, and the way that, basically Senegal gave a blueprint to France,
[7367.00 - 7375.00] P:1602.20 E:0.101419 |  and said, if you can implement this game plan to press, and to get it right, and what we would say is that one thing we've got in our favour on that,
[7375.00 - 7382.00] P:1718.52 E:0.101581 |  is France will start with Oligirou up front, who will not be able to do it in the same dynamic way,
[7382.00 - 7391.00] P:1782.76 E:0.089478 |  but if they get it right, they're going to be more clinical than Senegal, and that opening 15-20 minutes, we may have to change.
[7391.00 - 7400.00] P:1855.87 E:0.100834 |  Rob, we shall let you go, thank you very much, Rob Grimadus here, our five live will bring you some reaction when we get it as well from down in the tunnel.
[7400.00 - 7408.00] P:1921.12 E:0.089231 |  Harry Kane has told television, we've shown great maturity, mentality was top from the beginning, we took our chances when they came,
[7408.00 - 7416.00] P:1961.70 E:0.082158 |  we've got a great mixture of youth and experience now, to win 3-0, it really is a great night.
[7416.00 - 7425.00] P:1923.50 E:0.081180 |  Talking about all the wide players, Micah, and talking about the midfield players as well, actually means bizarrely,
[7425.00 - 7436.00] P:1867.12 E:0.082556 |  Harry Kane sort of goes under the radar and everything that we've talked about, but that felt, his performance side felt as close to a Tottenham performance from him,
[7436.00 - 7445.00] P:1815.74 E:0.091584 |  than I've seen in a long time in English, bear in mind the England USA game, where he looked like he was laboring here in this very same stadium.
[7445.00 - 7455.00] P:1933.41 E:0.084270 |  No, Harry Kane, he was class today, I think, we don't mind Harry Kane coming deep when we've got forward runners, you know, I think Sackle was excellent today,
[7455.00 - 7463.00] P:1910.80 E:0.093392 |  and I think Foden with his running in behind as well, although he was playing on the left, he was in the central areas as well,
[7463.00 - 7471.00] P:1945.01 E:0.083475 |  and we don't mind him coming deep, it's totally fine to do that, but you have to make impact when you do that,
[7471.00 - 7483.00] P:1938.34 E:0.086445 |  against USA they had too much legs, today he found the rhythm and exactly what England needed, it's going to be interesting how he plays against France,
[7483.00 - 7495.00] P:1935.83 E:0.082877 |  because I was watching them today as well, and defensively, you know, with Iran at the back, they've got real pace, they've got pace in the full back areas as well,
[7495.00 - 7505.00] P:1939.87 E:0.087638 |  but we need him to stay further up the pitch for the creative players in midfield, now he knows that Bellinom's going to run in behind,
[7505.00 - 7512.00] P:1949.72 E:0.086776 |  now he knows that Henderson's running behind, now he knows that Foden's going to pop into them pockets, he doesn't need to come as deep,
[7512.00 - 7521.00] P:1891.05 E:0.080065 |  against Senegal, okay, you can do that, but against France we're going to need him a little bit higher, but his overall performance today was excellent.
[7521.00 - 7531.00] P:1880.11 E:0.089803 |  Yeah, I think today what made it shine a little bit more is that our two midfield players in Henderson and Bellinom just got forward brilliantly,
[7531.00 - 7538.00] P:1827.29 E:0.099776 |  and I mean look at the Henderson goal, it's the Bellinom running beyond, Kane dropping deep, Foden flick round the corner,
[7538.00 - 7544.00] P:1859.16 E:0.096400 |  Kane then slides the ball into the run of Bellinom, he crosses it, Henderson scores, you can cope with your centre forward,
[7544.00 - 7550.00] P:1793.72 E:0.098481 |  dropping into that midfield area if the other two midfield players have gone banging behind, and that's what England did time and time again,
[7550.00 - 7558.00] P:1996.23 E:0.094623 |  it was so effective, and I thought that that allows Harry Kane to do that, if we haven't got those runs perhaps it would get a little bit congested
[7558.00 - 7561.00] P:1895.37 E:0.093766 |  and a little bit too much in front of the back four.
[7561.00 - 7569.00] P:1912.32 E:0.093841 |  Ellen White has rejoined us as well, it felt Ellen like, we've talked about Harry Kane dropping deep for about two or three years within this England team,
[7569.00 - 7573.00] P:1869.53 E:0.093888 |  he felt as effective doing that today as he has done.
[7573.00 - 7581.00] P:1844.63 E:0.082652 |  Yeah, definitely we spoke before didn't we, and what Mike just said about what he does for Tottenham is dropping deep, but then having those runners,
[7581.00 - 7589.00] P:1677.58 E:0.100249 |  but then at times when he scored his goal he was a lot higher, then Bellinom can run and travel with the ball, Foden was out wide, great ball into him,
[7589.00 - 7597.00] P:1865.03 E:0.095687 |  he was in a perfect position, lovely touch and scored, so he was picking up really great positions, but then it's all about the connection of the other players, isn't it?
[7597.00 - 7607.00] P:1895.98 E:0.091497 |  Bellinom, Foden, Sackler, even Henderson with his goal as well, everyone else working off each other and being in those positions if he is coming a little bit deeper.
[7607.00 - 7623.00] P:1856.15 E:0.077399 |  And for all of that, as we've been discussing here, it's almost as if they need to get the first goal to then be brave and we'll elaborate more on that very shortly after we hear from Phil Foden live with Gary Flintle.
[7623.00 - 7634.00] P:1302.51 E:0.101036 |  Thank you Mark, Phil many congratulations, you're into the quarter finals of the World Cup, the performance tonight you're an integral part of that, how much did you enjoy that game?
[7634.00 - 7646.00] P:1146.81 E:0.101206 |  Yeah, it feels great, everyone's on a massive up at the moment, obviously going to celebrate tonight and then tomorrow it's back to work now because we know the next opponent is very frightening on the day,
[7646.00 - 7649.00] P:1200.09 E:0.097873 |  so we're going to have to be on our best to beat them.
[7649.00 - 7658.00] P:1354.18 E:0.094799 |  It was very apparent in that first half that you felt that when it clicked a goal would come, but were you getting a little bit frustrated at one point?
[7658.00 - 7670.00] P:1311.37 E:0.103403 |  Definitely, they made it a frustrating game at times, they went man to man, but not only just that, they were very physical and quick, so it took a bit of time to get into the game for all of us and find out where the spaces are.
[7670.00 - 7681.00] P:1097.23 E:0.099381 |  As time passed we tired them around by knocking it around the back and then we started to open up spaces and found Harrymore which started to hurt him.
[7681.00 - 7694.00] P:1388.08 E:0.105486 |  There's been so much talk about the young guns if you will, yourself, Jude Bellingham, there's an oldest fella there, just like the older in Jordan Henderson, tell me about the part that he played, not only with the goal receiving but overall tonight.
[7694.00 - 7716.00] P:1302.26 E:0.100492 |  It was massive, when someone's not doing something right on the pitch, it's quick to tell you off and I don't mind, you need someone on the pitch who's a leader and a captain, he's definitely got that in his locker, so it was a pleasure to play on the field with him because he ups your game and everyone else around you, so it's a really important player for us.
[7716.00 - 7725.00] P:1399.90 E:0.102570 |  And you've alluded to it already, France await in the quarter finals, killing them, Bapay, everything that goes with that, how do you feel about the challenge that lies ahead?
[7725.00 - 7740.00] P:1263.85 E:0.095668 |  Yeah, we all want to play in the biggest games and there's no better game than playing in France, so if we're on form in our best game we can create chances and score, so we're looking forward to it and that's going to be a big challenge.
[7740.00 - 7742.00] P:1336.74 E:0.091902 |  Well done tonight, enjoy the celebrations.
[7742.00 - 7743.00] P:1196.38 E:0.065241 |  Thank you.
[7743.00 - 7755.00] P:1939.02 E:0.078095 |  Phil Foden live with Gary Flint off on 5 Live Sport. Ellen, let's just go back to the point of why sometimes it can feel like they need the first goal to then be brave.
[7755.00 - 7767.00] P:1864.76 E:0.089946 |  Yeah, definitely. Well, I feel like it kind of settles them down when they do score that first goal and well, we could have been 2-0 down before we obviously scored the Henderson goal.
[7767.00 - 7779.00] P:1846.62 E:0.090723 |  So yeah, I definitely feel like that first goal settles us down. What Foden just said actually, then they're able to find where the spaces are, where the pockets of space, what's working for them and they needed just a little bit of time to get into the game.
[7779.00 - 7789.00] P:1721.45 E:0.079710 |  And I think there's two chances that Pickford save kind of woke them up a little bit and then they seem to kind of get their groove in that first half towards the end of the first half.
[7789.00 - 7793.00] P:1997.78 E:0.057439 |  Do you think Matt, that's just a, is that a mental thing?
[7793.00 - 7804.00] P:1953.21 E:0.084830 |  Yes, it's a belief thing. It's sometimes a mixture of belief, arrogance and actually starting the game in that manner. There's a fine balance chappers, isn't there?
[7804.00 - 7816.00] P:1986.37 E:0.090058 |  Do you know what I mean between having the humility and the work ethic that England have? And I think we showed that tonight, but we touched on it before about that edge.
[7816.00 - 7826.00] P:1927.20 E:0.096405 |  How do you get that edge to be a world-direct, to be the best in the world? And I think that you can't afford to wait until you realise that you're playing well in the game and then all of a sudden it happens naturally.
[7826.00 - 7839.00] P:1956.37 E:0.084107 |  You have to try and start the game in that fashion. And I think that these performances of England should for me be topping that up so that we're getting closer and closer to starting matches in a way with a better team here.
[7839.00 - 7844.00] P:1901.38 E:0.081235 |  Even if we're playing France, I mean you look at the French team, I think we're more than capable.
[7844.00 - 7850.00] P:1648.15 E:0.080377 |  Hang on, I'm just going to go back down to the tunnel. Bacchiazacca is with Gary Flintoff.
[7850.00 - 7864.00] P:1427.51 E:0.095266 |  He has indeed had just mentioned to him, Mark, that it was a great finish for his gold tonight, but before we get on to that, what does it mean to make it through to the quarter-finals of the world's biggest football competition?
[7864.00 - 7874.00] P:1140.46 E:0.095054 |  Yeah, of course, like it just said, it doesn't get much bigger than this tournament. We know how much it meant to us and we went out there and delivered so we're happy with that performance.
[7874.00 - 7885.00] P:1381.90 E:0.098602 |  In terms of the performance, it always felt as if the moment you click, you get through them, but was there a little bit of frustration in that first half, but it didn't quite happen as early as you thought it might.
[7885.00 - 7899.00] P:1151.78 E:0.102131 |  Yeah, but of course, all respect to Senegal, you know, they're an amazing team, you know, they're champions of Africa, so we knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we know the quality we have and once it started to click, like you said, we felt so good, we created so many chances and we managed to finish the moment.
[7899.00 - 7912.00] P:1325.61 E:0.100307 |  You're such a great group, if you will. We know the captain hasn't scored until tonight, so he's been very much involved in the play, but what does it mean to you that Harry Kane has registered his first goal at the World Cup?
[7912.00 - 7940.00] P:1132.63 E:0.106923 |  No, Harry Kane is like inevitable, you know, he was always going to score goals. I was never worried about that, you know, he's been exceptional for us, you know, you can see the, he's lacked the blue of the team, you know, how much he's linking up all the attacks and I think he's got like a few assists already, so it's not as if, you know, he's not doing anything, you know, he's been so good for us and yeah, I know he was going to get his goal, he showed unbelievable composure because it took him so long to strike the ball, but yeah, he managed to do what Harry Kane does and put the ball in the net.
[7940.00 - 7950.00] P:1424.15 E:0.107445 |  Well, talking of, you know, Harry Kane does what Harry Kane does, I mean, you're finished, talk me through it, I mean, the ball played into you, was it always to go a bit cheeky, a bit cute over the keeper?
[7951.00 - 7965.00] P:1078.04 E:0.102530 |  No, for me, I saw obviously Mendy coming towards me in the corner of my eye and I knew of course if I just lifted it a bit, you know, it would be able to go in, so luckily I managed to get a good technique and obviously thanks to Phil for the great pass.
[7965.00 - 7969.00] P:1297.86 E:0.105317 |  Well, well done tonight and the very best of luck against the French who follow next.
[7969.00 - 7970.00] P:1138.07 E:0.091072 |  Thank you very much.
[7970.00 - 7972.00] P:1195.19 E:0.113578 |  Well played tonight, thank you.
[7972.00 - 7980.00] P:1765.14 E:0.090923 |  You can tell the spirit in the camaraderie, can't you, Micah, because he's kind of taking the mic a bit out of Harry Kane for how long it took him to hit the ball.
[7981.00 - 7992.00] P:1986.59 E:0.077017 |  It was brilliant, wasn't it? And I think that is what you like to see. I don't think these players understand how good they are and can be.
[7992.00 - 8004.00] P:1956.55 E:0.078302 |  Going back to Matt's point before, it was sort of starting the game, it was a little bit laboured, a little bit unsure and I know you have to work out of the game, but they're a really good team.
[8004.00 - 8011.00] P:1889.94 E:0.084613 |  They should take confidence that they got to the Euros final and they've been to a World Cup semi-final before and I just love the team spirit.
[8011.00 - 8015.00] P:1981.82 E:0.069654 |  I love those interviews, but it's a big one next.
[8015.00 - 8032.00] P:1860.83 E:0.081398 |  When we had the radio together, I said we've not played anyone. This was a different test tonight, there was physical, but now next game we have real quality and they can't start how they did tonight against France because they will get punished.
[8032.00 - 8039.00] P:1914.92 E:0.077914 |  If they start like they did in times, you know, in second half, so towards the end of the first half today, they'll be fine.
[8040.00 - 8044.00] P:1999.10 E:0.057155 |  Just moving on from negative Nigel again.
[8044.00 - 8046.00] P:1688.68 E:0.093733 |  We were saying we're going to win it at the moment.
[8046.00 - 8048.00] P:1798.51 E:0.107783 |  No, no, no, now I'm really out.
[8048.00 - 8055.00] P:1798.55 E:0.093683 |  You asked the question a couple of questions ago about what are the negatives or what you asked Rob.
[8055.00 - 8057.00] P:1914.43 E:0.091314 |  What would be a concern?
[8058.00 - 8067.00] P:1934.62 E:0.071492 |  A concern would be starting slow, defensive, mishaps at times.
[8067.00 - 8079.00] P:1941.58 E:0.077582 |  We got away with a couple early mistakes and dealing with them one-on-one situations every time England concede an attack.
[8079.00 - 8087.00] P:1968.36 E:0.082257 |  They don't know to me exactly, or feel to me exactly know what they're actually doing or supposed to be.
[8087.00 - 8091.00] P:1944.73 E:0.080123 |  Maybe I'm being harsh, but that's just me seeing the defensive side of things.
[8091.00 - 8098.00] P:1832.36 E:0.080890 |  Away from the defensive side of things, I do think, and basically I'm saying away from the back four, who were solid.
[8098.00 - 8100.00] P:1542.67 E:0.089303 |  I mean, they've not conceded a goal again.
[8100.00 - 8102.00] P:1774.48 E:0.087963 |  Look, they had some wobbly moments, Matt.
[8102.00 - 8106.00] P:1843.14 E:0.081087 |  OK, but you see in the dressing room, we haven't conceded, do you?
[8106.00 - 8117.00] P:1793.39 E:0.075771 |  But I'll come back to them in a second, but away from that back four, any of the other six further forward, we could pick out for praise tonight.
[8117.00 - 8120.00] P:1734.17 E:0.090416 |  And do five or ten minutes on each of them.
[8120.00 - 8122.00] P:1925.97 E:0.039360 |  Yeah, comfortably.
[8122.00 - 8126.00] P:1810.16 E:0.084442 |  Comfortable. I mean, it was a powerhouse midfield display by all three.
[8126.00 - 8138.00] P:1919.61 E:0.076142 |  And there's a standout man in terms of doing a little bit of everything in Jude Bellingham, goal threat, creator, physicality, the energy, the body language, the freedom.
[8138.00 - 8144.00] P:1902.57 E:0.079374 |  What we're talking about, we want every England player to start the game like.
[8144.00 - 8147.00] P:1899.26 E:0.081577 |  I think he started the game in that fashion today.
[8147.00 - 8153.00] P:1971.72 E:0.083183 |  And sometimes it is a young player who's fearless and just thinking of the moment and enjoying the moment.
[8153.00 - 8157.00] P:1853.86 E:0.090859 |  He hasn't been through loads of experiences and understands what that is.
[8157.00 - 8160.00] P:1972.23 E:0.082850 |  So that for me was a huge catalyst for England.
[8160.00 - 8162.00] P:1629.13 E:0.097945 |  And I think that he led by example in that sense.
[8162.00 - 8166.00] P:1799.65 E:0.082015 |  And Declan Rice, Jordan Henderson kind of backing him up in that way.
[8166.00 - 8170.00] P:1790.51 E:0.092799 |  I thought it was a really, really solid midfield performance.
[8170.00 - 8174.00] P:1746.73 E:0.092806 |  I thought Ellen as well, there was a freedom about Henderson at times.
[8174.00 - 8182.00] P:1844.07 E:0.083865 |  So if you're talking about a freedom from Henderson and a freedom from Bellingham, that's why I would include Declan Rice for the praise really.
[8182.00 - 8186.00] P:1802.23 E:0.089472 |  Because his performance allows the freedom of others.
[8186.00 - 8187.00] P:2141.64 E:0.015590 |  Yeah, definitely.
[8187.00 - 8192.00] P:1836.50 E:0.085807 |  And I think he said an interview before as well about Bellingham that he's told him to go and be free and do what he does.
[8192.00 - 8196.00] P:1788.49 E:0.081169 |  Because he'll be at the back tackling, intercepting, being in great positions.
[8196.00 - 8203.00] P:1834.66 E:0.083347 |  And you could see towards the end of the game, he was greater getting little free kicks and just slowing the game down as well for England.
[8203.00 - 8206.00] P:1713.87 E:0.061288 |  So yeah, you can't deny his role as well tonight.
[8206.00 - 8211.00] P:1932.32 E:0.087784 |  And yeah, definitely seeing Henderson more freer and getting forward and obviously his goal scored.
[8211.00 - 8213.00] P:1844.83 E:0.087901 |  It's really nice to see.
[8213.00 - 8217.00] P:1808.23 E:0.072553 |  I don't know whether that might change the France game obviously.
[8217.00 - 8225.00] P:1900.65 E:0.065210 |  But yeah, I felt like the midfield and the front free looked really exciting tonight.
[8225.00 - 8232.00] P:1924.75 E:0.067467 |  Well, the fact that you've mentioned it, would you change anything for France?
[8232.00 - 8235.00] P:1923.94 E:0.079623 |  I don't think you can, can you?
[8235.00 - 8238.00] P:1837.38 E:0.085028 |  Well, I would agree with you, but...
[8242.00 - 8243.00] P:1927.68 E:0.059813 |  Dele?
[8243.00 - 8244.00] P:2021.89 E:0.084904 |  Yes, I'm here, sorry.
[8244.00 - 8245.00] P:1811.89 E:0.100483 |  Oh right, sorry.
[8245.00 - 8247.00] P:1863.80 E:0.098965 |  I thought you were carrying on.
[8247.00 - 8249.00] P:1962.33 E:0.101718 |  No, no, no, no, no, I was just leaving.
[8249.00 - 8251.00] P:1666.85 E:0.096678 |  But hang on, I would agree with you.
[8251.00 - 8257.00] P:1963.24 E:0.066144 |  But they may look at the opposition and decide to do something different.
[8257.00 - 8260.00] P:2020.03 E:0.066177 |  Yeah, no, I do agree.
[8260.00 - 8264.00] P:1881.83 E:0.083956 |  But then I think these players have played very well tonight.
[8264.00 - 8269.00] P:1900.13 E:0.077968 |  They seem to have a good connection, but it's what the guys said as well before not to be negative as well.
[8269.00 - 8274.00] P:1838.32 E:0.086230 |  Those two chances that Senegal had, I believe that France probably would have scored those chances.
[8274.00 - 8280.00] P:1796.86 E:0.084624 |  So they've got to come out the blocks early and have that belief and mentality that they can go out there,
[8280.00 - 8282.00] P:1733.03 E:0.075875 |  create chances and beat France.
[8282.00 - 8284.00] P:1524.04 E:0.086919 |  So they need to come out fast.
[8284.00 - 8287.00] P:1844.81 E:0.073380 |  But yeah, I just don't think you can change that team.
[8287.00 - 8291.00] P:1731.59 E:0.088544 |  They've got confidence, momentum, Harry scored, which has given him a lot of confidence.
[8291.00 - 8295.00] P:1687.23 E:0.075181 |  He's looked like, like I said, he's a great kind of glue to the team.
[8295.00 - 8297.00] P:1808.11 E:0.080028 |  So everything seems to be working.
[8297.00 - 8304.00] P:1712.52 E:0.078639 |  It is maybe just that back four that you're a bit like, oh, I don't know, with the front three that France have.
[8304.00 - 8310.00] P:1964.66 E:0.064867 |  It goes back to the argument and the debate about how much you go to the opposition.
[8310.00 - 8313.00] P:1999.23 E:0.086434 |  No, you worry about us or how much you go.
[8313.00 - 8316.00] P:1862.89 E:0.092059 |  Oh, we might be a bit worried about you.
[8316.00 - 8324.00] P:1846.24 E:0.085870 |  I think also the way the game plays out and today was very much a game where England had a lot of the ball and we wanted to make the pitch big.
[8324.00 - 8330.00] P:1935.85 E:0.074305 |  And as a centre back, you're probably at your most vulnerable in that situation.
[8330.00 - 8338.00] P:1761.87 E:0.093639 |  Then if you're playing against, say, a USA where the game's frantic, you're nice and compact, you're dealing with loads of balls and you might have to be dominant.
[8338.00 - 8339.00] P:1881.96 E:0.084981 |  You might have to be physical.
[8339.00 - 8341.00] P:1889.26 E:0.091670 |  You might have to clear balls, head balls, tackle.
[8341.00 - 8346.00] P:1915.89 E:0.080254 |  And I thought that Harry Maguire did that brilliantly in that game and he's been very solid in this tournament.
[8346.00 - 8354.00] P:1931.45 E:0.085850 |  But this is a different type of situation and there's just a couple of times if there's too much space around as a centre back, it can be a dangerous thing.
[8354.00 - 8360.00] P:1906.10 E:0.085762 |  And you get isolated in those 1v1 situations with a Dembele, with a Umbape.
[8360.00 - 8365.00] P:1867.68 E:0.083495 |  I think you're going to start to see the devastation they can cause.
[8365.00 - 8370.00] P:1919.53 E:0.084502 |  So it's whether or not we can just contain that and just support our players in those positions to keep solid.
[8370.00 - 8380.00] P:1946.95 E:0.080400 |  Rob's point earlier, wasn't it, Mike, was that Olivier Giroud wouldn't necessarily be closing down the centre backs with the same enthusiasm and speed that maybe Senegal were.
[8380.00 - 8382.00] P:1588.73 E:0.090836 |  But Rob's point is valid.
[8382.00 - 8389.00] P:1850.81 E:0.081304 |  Actually, it could be Dembele coming in off the wing to use his pace to get to Maguire quickly.
[8389.00 - 8393.00] P:1994.55 E:0.060860 |  Friends don't need to press because they have the ball all the time.
[8393.00 - 8394.00] P:2039.76 E:0.060673 |  It's a completely different game.
[8394.00 - 8398.00] P:1816.32 E:0.070770 |  What's the game today that was dominating?
[8398.00 - 8401.00] P:1721.55 E:0.088795 |  I don't think they'll have the ball all the time against us, though, Mike.
[8401.00 - 8406.00] P:1983.51 E:0.089001 |  I think they'll have 55%, 60% of the ball.
[8406.00 - 8413.00] P:2007.51 E:0.070563 |  I think watching them today, they're confident with Griezmann in their little pockets,
[8413.00 - 8417.00] P:2046.06 E:0.085755 |  and Bapuion left hand side, Dembele and then Giroud.
[8417.00 - 8422.00] P:1947.17 E:0.089434 |  The difference they've got with Giroud, Giroud holds up the ball and brings everyone into play.
[8422.00 - 8427.00] P:1992.20 E:0.078394 |  Every time they try to get out today, Paul, they just couldn't do it.
[8427.00 - 8432.00] P:1932.32 E:0.076378 |  Do you not think today with England it's more when we have the ball at the back?
[8432.00 - 8437.00] P:1833.82 E:0.091996 |  And if that pass isn't quite right, or if it's not quite confident or the wrong choice,
[8437.00 - 8442.00] P:1959.44 E:0.087916 |  and it turns over quickly the wrong side of our midfield, that's the moment.
[8442.00 - 8446.00] P:1741.22 E:0.096235 |  And that's what I'm talking about in us having the ball being split and expansive
[8446.00 - 8448.00] P:1998.49 E:0.088035 |  because we want to keep possession and make the pitch big.
[8448.00 - 8451.00] P:1823.71 E:0.092111 |  But if the pass is not the right one or it just gets cut out,
[8451.00 - 8454.00] P:2020.78 E:0.076633 |  I think that's when we can look a bit vulnerable.
[8454.00 - 8459.00] P:1869.46 E:0.090115 |  Yeah, I would agree with that. I think another thing a concern for me as well.
[8459.00 - 8463.00] P:1948.78 E:0.092002 |  A lot of people talking about this, the matchup between Walker and Mbappe.
[8463.00 - 8467.00] P:2068.23 E:0.086900 |  But if you actually see where Mbappe scored his goals from today,
[8467.00 - 8471.00] P:2028.97 E:0.085810 |  we're more central to the pitch. It's not like from the wing.
[8471.00 - 8474.00] P:1748.64 E:0.102584 |  He had a few opportunities where he went down the byline, crossed it and it was there.
[8474.00 - 8476.00] P:2059.79 E:0.084524 |  So I thought I'm doing this myself.
[8476.00 - 8481.00] P:2090.16 E:0.087501 |  He's coming from the inside left position and whipped two absolute beauties.
[8481.00 - 8483.00] P:2050.01 E:0.081517 |  Mbappe gets into a position.
[8483.00 - 8486.00] P:1913.87 E:0.095994 |  You've got Pierre Hernandez who's going to overlap.
[8486.00 - 8488.00] P:2097.37 E:0.065247 |  Walker might be going with you.
[8488.00 - 8492.00] P:1930.06 E:0.095287 |  Hernandez, it's going to be stones who are having to deal at times within Bata.
[8492.00 - 8494.00] P:2075.60 E:0.066277 |  And that's where I'm worrying.
[8494.00 - 8498.00] P:2040.46 E:0.064923 |  Unless you go to a back three.
[8498.00 - 8501.00] P:1879.05 E:0.085326 |  No, we're not doing no back three.
[8501.00 - 8504.00] P:1847.81 E:0.089654 |  I'm sick to death of talking about a back three.
[8504.00 - 8506.00] P:1997.53 E:0.085626 |  We've played excellent football.
[8506.00 - 8509.00] P:1919.92 E:0.092401 |  We're back four. I know you're giving me another option, Shappas,
[8509.00 - 8513.00] P:2099.15 E:0.083501 |  but if we was to go to a back three and lose,
[8513.00 - 8520.00] P:1927.47 E:0.049070 |  everyone would be going mad.
[8520.00 - 8522.00] P:1894.65 E:0.095730 |  Yeah, I was going to say a different word.
[8522.00 - 8531.00] P:1840.76 E:0.075216 |  But the back three solves that problem you've just said of where Mbappe drifts.
[8531.00 - 8533.00] P:1921.86 E:0.106659 |  It might cause issues elsewhere.
[8533.00 - 8534.00] P:1599.12 E:0.063202 |  Yeah.
[8534.00 - 8538.00] P:1661.62 E:0.096814 |  But you'd have a win back that would try and help the overload from Theo Hernandez.
[8538.00 - 8544.00] P:1797.30 E:0.090680 |  But you'd have your right of a three to cover a channel where Mbappe wants to operate.
[8544.00 - 8548.00] P:1657.62 E:0.077496 |  And before I get hammered here, I'm not advocating that, right?
[8548.00 - 8550.00] P:1882.24 E:0.104452 |  It's probably the best solution.
[8550.00 - 8557.00] P:1858.01 E:0.088088 |  I'm just saying there's a system there if Micah is worried about that particular point.
[8557.00 - 8561.00] P:1859.76 E:0.071279 |  I think if you play it against top wide players with pace,
[8561.00 - 8565.00] P:1792.32 E:0.075693 |  sometimes a back three is the worst formation you can have
[8565.00 - 8568.00] P:1993.78 E:0.074466 |  because the space is all down the channels.
[8568.00 - 8574.00] P:1872.54 E:0.074914 |  Unless you've got wide centre backs that can really run and a happy coping with that,
[8574.00 - 8577.00] P:1830.68 E:0.089398 |  I think you can just land you in more bother, to be honest.
[8577.00 - 8579.00] P:1825.00 E:0.092095 |  And there's more space in that area.
[8579.00 - 8583.00] P:1807.09 E:0.086488 |  And the nice thing about having a fullback in there, you make it a bit of a personal duel.
[8583.00 - 8587.00] P:1834.74 E:0.089861 |  Like we've been talking about this Walker and Mbappe matchup and all of this.
[8587.00 - 8590.00] P:1624.15 E:0.092578 |  And you kind of think, well, okay, all right, I'll have a bit of that.
[8590.00 - 8591.00] P:1658.60 E:0.094492 |  I'll get my head on it.
[8591.00 - 8592.00] P:1948.63 E:0.069856 |  Mbappe's a back muck.
[8592.00 - 8594.00] P:1735.92 E:0.089257 |  You know, as a right back muck, sometimes defensively,
[8594.00 - 8597.00] P:1665.04 E:0.086181 |  the best thing you can know is easy one playing against today.
[8597.00 - 8598.00] P:1744.99 E:0.094596 |  It's my job.
[8598.00 - 8601.00] P:1591.78 E:0.102228 |  I'll own it, take responsibility, and I've got to play well.
[8601.00 - 8602.00] P:1839.49 E:0.081325 |  And you know where you stand.
[8602.00 - 8606.00] P:1898.35 E:0.068589 |  Mattie Cash played very well against Mbappe today.
[8606.00 - 8607.00] P:2162.29 E:0.102954 |  And he still scored two goals.
[8607.00 - 8609.00] P:1574.84 E:0.102917 |  He's had a great tournament in cash house.
[8609.00 - 8610.00] P:1452.36 E:0.108637 |  He has.
[8610.00 - 8611.00] P:1460.88 E:0.101566 |  He's had a brilliant tournament.
[8611.00 - 8614.00] P:1846.94 E:0.069663 |  But again, it's that movement.
[8614.00 - 8617.00] P:1879.21 E:0.090246 |  It's not just, I think a lot of people think it's just in Mbappe.
[8617.00 - 8623.00] P:1938.61 E:0.090179 |  It's Griezmann's movement, which allows the space for Mbappe to do what he needs to do.
[8623.00 - 8627.00] P:1780.07 E:0.093881 |  We're going to head back down to the tunnel area now
[8627.00 - 8631.00] P:1771.17 E:0.076423 |  and get the thoughts of Gareth Southgate talking to John Murray.
[8631.00 - 8633.00] P:1735.05 E:0.083697 |  Yes, here is Gareth Southgate.
[8633.00 - 8635.00] P:1429.67 E:0.060163 |  Quarter finalist again, Gareth.
[8635.00 - 8638.00] P:1327.50 E:0.074569 |  That must be a very satisfying evening you've had there on the pitch.
[8638.00 - 8639.00] P:1267.93 E:0.085813 |  Very much so.
[8639.00 - 8642.00] P:1163.29 E:0.096344 |  I think the ruthlessness of the performance was excellent.
[8642.00 - 8648.00] P:1350.53 E:0.093722 |  We struggled a little bit to break through Senegal's pressure at the start of the game.
[8648.00 - 8654.00] P:1259.65 E:0.091584 |  But sometimes you've got to move teams and tire them to be able to reap the benefits in the second half.
[8654.00 - 8658.00] P:1352.69 E:0.091552 |  What we did do well was our pressure when they had the ball was excellent.
[8658.00 - 8662.00] P:1254.92 E:0.091169 |  And turning the ball over were our best opportunities in that first half.
[8662.00 - 8667.00] P:1360.95 E:0.095017 |  And I thought Jude and Jordan Henderson were excellent in that period in particular.
[8667.00 - 8671.00] P:1398.87 E:0.096055 |  In the first half, it was again, as you've said during this tournament, hasn't it?
[8671.00 - 8675.00] P:1200.23 E:0.085196 |  It was about linking the two aspects of play together.
[8675.00 - 8677.00] P:992.00 E:0.076974 |  But you got there.
[8677.00 - 8678.00] P:1677.34 E:0.085919 |  Yes, we did.
[8678.00 - 8683.00] P:1320.61 E:0.091459 |  And look, there are every match you play is a different sort of challenge
[8683.00 - 8686.00] P:1173.99 E:0.087694 |  and different tactical problem to resolve.
[8686.00 - 8691.00] P:1495.19 E:0.098684 |  And we've stepped up and we're answering those questions.
[8691.00 - 8696.00] P:1218.31 E:0.095253 |  And I thought the quality of the moves for our goals were absolutely outstanding
[8696.00 - 8698.00] P:1551.41 E:0.089651 |  and the finishes were absolutely ruthless.
[8698.00 - 8701.00] P:1065.17 E:0.078062 |  Are the possibilities exciting here?
[8701.00 - 8702.00] P:1328.39 E:0.077935 |  Well, they are.
[8702.00 - 8705.00] P:1189.65 E:0.089032 |  I mean, we've got a brilliant tie, haven't we?
[8705.00 - 8711.00] P:1334.06 E:0.088682 |  The two quarterfinals are fabulous football nations, great history.
[8711.00 - 8713.00] P:1421.05 E:0.093242 |  Couldn't be more exciting.
[8713.00 - 8716.00] P:1303.29 E:0.109079 |  Our history not quite as good as all the others, by the way.
[8716.00 - 8723.00] P:1469.86 E:0.084682 |  But we're really pleased I've just been told it's the first time we've won knockout games
[8723.00 - 8725.00] P:1456.55 E:0.097233 |  in three consecutive tournaments.
[8725.00 - 8729.00] P:1606.66 E:0.086990 |  That's another bit of history that this team have managed to achieve
[8729.00 - 8731.00] P:1342.34 E:0.088110 |  and we've got to keep trying to do that.
[8731.00 - 8734.00] P:1323.73 E:0.096320 |  But you've broken down lots of barriers, haven't you?
[8734.00 - 8737.00] P:1280.50 E:0.098168 |  And broken lots of records, one or two not so good ones.
[8737.00 - 8743.00] P:1490.52 E:0.074746 |  But to beat the world champions at this stage, a team like France,
[8743.00 - 8746.00] P:1088.71 E:0.089043 |  that was something I remember you saying a while back
[8746.00 - 8751.00] P:1196.55 E:0.096573 |  that you wanted your team to be doing on a regular basis, beating teams of that level.
[8751.00 - 8753.00] P:1351.74 E:0.088563 |  And you've got to do that to get further.
[8753.00 - 8754.00] P:1384.58 E:0.074857 |  Yeah, exactly.
[8754.00 - 8756.00] P:1367.81 E:0.091676 |  So, this is the asset test for us.
[8756.00 - 8760.00] P:1009.79 E:0.081984 |  We know it's a step up from everything we've had so far.
[8760.00 - 8766.00] P:1346.13 E:0.080767 |  But the team have garnered so much experience in the last few years.
[8766.00 - 8768.00] P:1270.00 E:0.094111 |  They're playing with confidence.
[8768.00 - 8770.00] P:1463.22 E:0.089110 |  We look threatening, we're scoring goals.
[8770.00 - 8773.00] P:1353.60 E:0.088624 |  Another clean sheet, which was really pleasing to see.
[8773.00 - 8777.00] P:1299.46 E:0.090176 |  So, we're in a good place, but we know the level of the opposition as well.
[8777.00 - 8781.00] P:1282.61 E:0.086610 |  Gareth, I've got to ask you one more thing about Raheem Sterling.
[8781.00 - 8785.00] P:1187.84 E:0.091591 |  The news does appear to have come out now about what's happened at home.
[8785.00 - 8789.00] P:1172.62 E:0.083723 |  That there's been some sort of break-in at his home.
[8789.00 - 8794.00] P:1349.17 E:0.089947 |  I mean, it sounds really, really frightening and a horrible experience for him
[8794.00 - 8796.00] P:1584.70 E:0.083268 |  to have to go through when he's here.
[8796.00 - 8799.00] P:1417.37 E:0.085008 |  So, how is he and what's going to happen next?
[8799.00 - 8801.00] P:1311.04 E:0.106621 |  Yeah, I've spent some time with him today.
[8801.00 - 8803.00] P:974.03 E:0.090975 |  He's going to fly home.
[8803.00 - 8808.00] P:1396.37 E:0.086479 |  And obviously, family at these moments is the most important thing.
[8808.00 - 8810.00] P:1470.26 E:0.100776 |  So, we want to give him that space.
[8810.00 - 8814.00] P:1373.09 E:0.093101 |  And we'll see over the next few days how that all develops.
[8814.00 - 8816.00] P:1264.69 E:0.086175 |  Thanks, Gareth. Thanks, John.
[8816.00 - 8818.00] P:1857.18 E:0.048392 |  Thank you.
[8818.00 - 8822.00] P:1737.84 E:0.075183 |  Gareth Hathgate talking to John Murray.
[8822.00 - 8826.00] P:1959.45 E:0.070463 |  Let me just give you the latest news on Raheem Sterling.
[8826.00 - 8833.00] P:1718.63 E:0.075465 |  So, the reports are that he missed tonight, as Gareth said,
[8833.00 - 8835.00] P:1712.95 E:0.075909 |  because there was a break-in at his house.
[8835.00 - 8838.00] P:1856.92 E:0.086452 |  Actually, armed intruders broke into his house in the UK.
[8838.00 - 8841.00] P:1704.97 E:0.070754 |  And his family were there at the time.
[8841.00 - 8843.00] P:1588.52 E:0.078492 |  And obviously, he is out here.
[8843.00 - 8848.00] P:1800.18 E:0.086858 |  So, Raheem Sterling is going to return home, understandably, to be with his children.
[8848.00 - 8856.00] P:1705.62 E:0.073269 |  And he could return to Qatar, is the report, if the circumstances allow.
[8856.00 - 8861.00] P:1585.10 E:0.076701 |  But at the moment, Raheem Sterling is heading home,
[8861.00 - 8865.00] P:1706.54 E:0.068287 |  because armed intruders broke into his home.
[8865.00 - 8869.00] P:1699.04 E:0.071964 |  You despair, don't you, Matt, at times?
[8869.00 - 8871.00] P:1543.29 E:0.089987 |  I don't know what to say.
[8871.00 - 8873.00] P:1946.30 E:0.097769 |  It's just shocking news, to be honest.
[8873.00 - 8874.00] P:1802.94 E:0.079957 |  It's disgraceful news.
[8874.00 - 8877.00] P:1507.07 E:0.105001 |  And I really feel for him and his family in sympathising.
[8877.00 - 8879.00] P:1386.70 E:0.098182 |  Absolutely family first.
[8879.00 - 8882.00] P:1930.16 E:0.090092 |  And get home and check in everyone's OK.
[8882.00 - 8884.00] P:1805.79 E:0.052454 |  And terrible. Really awful news.
[8884.00 - 8885.00] P:1216.54 E:0.091879 |  Awful.
[8885.00 - 8888.00] P:1659.45 E:0.066156 |  Thoughts with him as well, actually,
[8888.00 - 8891.00] P:1753.68 E:0.083406 |  because that must be a horrific plane journey to be back on,
[8891.00 - 8896.00] P:1819.21 E:0.068893 |  just worrying about your family and your kids and what they have gone through.
[8896.00 - 8904.00] P:1868.12 E:0.069035 |  So, our thoughts with him, our thoughts with his kids and his family as well.
[8904.00 - 8906.00] P:1516.29 E:0.075489 |  We might get a little bit more reaction.
[8906.00 - 8910.00] P:1820.58 E:0.077634 |  Here in Qatar, 606 is on the way.
[8910.00 - 8913.00] P:1868.67 E:0.079872 |  Ellen White is still with us as well.
[8913.00 - 8915.00] P:1863.80 E:0.059292 |  To move it back to the football, Ellen,
[8915.00 - 8919.00] P:1784.12 E:0.075950 |  one of the things you really take out of that Karasafka interview
[8919.00 - 8923.00] P:1882.91 E:0.070457 |  is just how impressed he himself was with the quality of the moves
[8923.00 - 8927.00] P:1765.88 E:0.077049 |  and the quality of the finishing tonight from his England players.
[8927.00 - 8928.00] P:1705.13 E:0.070623 |  Yeah, definitely.
[8928.00 - 8932.00] P:1790.41 E:0.077656 |  I just wanted to say as well, yeah, lots of love to Raheem and his family as well.
[8932.00 - 8933.00] P:1461.30 E:0.092310 |  So, that's horrible.
[8933.00 - 8937.00] P:1743.05 E:0.077841 |  But, yeah, no, I think we were just very, very clinical.
[8937.00 - 8942.00] P:1809.74 E:0.077476 |  I think, you know, we had three kind of clear-cut chances and we scored them,
[8942.00 - 8946.00] P:1912.17 E:0.069875 |  which is what you need in these knockout stages against, you know,
[8946.00 - 8949.00] P:1644.38 E:0.088707 |  we're going now to face the holders of the World Cup.
[8949.00 - 8958.00] P:2013.35 E:0.074835 |  So, you know, to have those strikers, attackers, midfielders that are all firing, scoring,
[8958.00 - 8963.00] P:1891.92 E:0.076141 |  and, you know, the goals are going in, it's really positive for us moving forward.
[8963.00 - 8967.00] P:1955.51 E:0.074785 |  So, yeah, it was really good kind of forward play from England tonight.
[8967.00 - 8970.00] P:2029.63 E:0.069981 |  Ellen, thank you very much for being with us this evening.
[8970.00 - 8971.00] P:1911.92 E:0.082417 |  We will talk soon.
[8971.00 - 8974.00] P:1840.79 E:0.080053 |  Ellen White with us on Five Lives Sport.
[8974.00 - 8979.00] P:1844.50 E:0.066749 |  We'll look ahead a little bit more to the French game in just a second
[8979.00 - 8982.00] P:1794.51 E:0.058002 |  and then it will be Chris and Robbie with 6-0-6.
