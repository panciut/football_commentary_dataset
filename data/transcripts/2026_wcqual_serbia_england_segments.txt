[0.00 - 8.32] P:1484.41 E:0.061465 |  Serbia against England, both unbeaten without having conceded a goal in this section so far.
[8.32 - 14.96] P:1610.45 E:0.083524 |  In the England team tonight, Anthony Gordon just sprints over there and has a little embrace
[14.96 - 22.40] P:1759.66 E:0.086127 |  with Rhys James and there's a high five with Nani Madweyke as well and the players just
[22.40 - 29.00] P:1780.56 E:0.083640 |  preparing now for the start of this fifth match for England in the group.
[29.00 - 34.60] P:1806.10 E:0.097248 |  Serbia against England, the Serbian team, Dragan Stojkovic, the great Dragan Stojkovic,
[34.60 - 41.40] P:1796.04 E:0.087969 |  their coach, he's also made four changes for this match and before we get underway there's going to be a
[41.40 - 49.72] P:1680.73 E:0.090572 |  moment's silence to remember the recently deceased Dobrovoce Tanasijevic whose image
[49.72 - 53.88] P:1766.24 E:0.088782 |  is being shown on the big screen at one end of the stadium.
[59.72 - 66.36] P:1742.82 E:0.105179 |  We can't last before a moment of silence to pay the last respect to one of the most loyal
[66.36 - 69.72] P:1587.11 E:0.076986 |  ambassadors of Serbia football in the world.
[89.00 - 107.64] P:1518.65 E:0.109044 |  That is the whistle blown by one of the most experienced referees around,
[107.64 - 112.60] P:1729.88 E:0.079307 |  Clement Terpan, the Frenchman, whose referee, the Champions League final in his time.
[112.60 - 117.00] P:1663.55 E:0.098832 |  I don't think it's any coincidence that a referee of that standing has been appointed to this match
[117.56 - 127.32] P:1775.52 E:0.079410 |  and there is I think a nervousness in the home sections in the Serbian Football Association.
[127.32 - 133.00] P:1655.12 E:0.096774 |  They are very very keen that this passes off without incident here this evening and have made
[133.00 - 138.92] P:1674.64 E:0.094524 |  themselves very clear on that front and there is the three-step UEFA protocol which has been
[138.92 - 143.48] P:1634.11 E:0.091179 |  discussed by the England players in advance of this match. Serbia team Petrovic in goal,
[143.48 - 148.28] P:1623.04 E:0.081554 |  the Bournemouth goalkeeper, Eracovic, Milenkovic the captain from Nottingham Forest,
[148.28 - 153.40] P:1676.12 E:0.091440 |  Pavlovic the three central defenders, Nadelkovic as the match begins England kickoff,
[153.40 - 158.52] P:1880.56 E:0.100532 |  Declan Rice playing it back to Jordan Pickford. So Nadelkovic one of the players coming in,
[158.52 - 163.64] P:1691.99 E:0.091694 |  he's at life's sake currently on loan from Aston Villa. That's a long pass from Pickford to Kane
[163.64 - 168.36] P:1660.34 E:0.084400 |  inside the penalty area, tried to head it back towards the edge of the box and Thomas Tuchel
[168.36 - 172.36] P:1617.06 E:0.094051 |  said it at the weekend they're not going to be frightened to go direct and that's what they did
[172.36 - 176.60] P:1724.73 E:0.096402 |  Paul Robinson right from the start. Spoke about long ball, spoke about the importance of set plays
[176.60 - 180.60] P:1860.87 E:0.099729 |  that he's not afraid to go direct immediately from the kickoff all the England players lined up on
[180.60 - 185.08] P:1868.21 E:0.099171 |  the halfway line. Declan Rice played it back to Jordan Pickford who in turn launched it all the
[185.08 - 189.40] P:1809.65 E:0.088240 |  way into the Serbian penalty box and Harry Kane was battling for the header, came to nothing but early
[189.40 - 195.72] P:1659.89 E:0.089996 |  intentions are clear. So England with Mark Gay who's able just to knock the ball across to Esri
[195.72 - 201.00] P:1543.35 E:0.090488 |  Konzat and a slip there in centrefield by Elliot Anderson but England are still in possession at
[201.00 - 207.24] P:1597.91 E:0.089718 |  the back. So yes the rest of the Serbia team, Nadelkovic on the right hand side, Illic Lukic of
[207.24 - 214.20] P:1627.78 E:0.082690 |  Fulham, Maximovic and Bermanchovic across the middle section then Zivkovic and the Juventus
[214.20 - 220.28] P:1727.75 E:0.093071 |  Man Vlahovic who scored the winner in regatt against Latvia on Saturday. England attacking
[220.28 - 227.48] P:1699.69 E:0.098285 |  down the right hand side with Noni Madweke who is hauled to the ground and that is a free kick
[227.48 - 231.96] P:1597.08 E:0.090315 |  Bermanchovic. There's another one of the four players who've come in, manhandled him to the ground
[232.52 - 237.32] P:1708.25 E:0.088692 |  and it is a free kick and a very good possession for England on the right. Noticeable from England
[237.32 - 241.56] P:1681.64 E:0.098025 |  already the two wide players when England are in possession. Madweke and Anthony Gordon they both
[241.56 - 245.08] P:1822.27 E:0.093533 |  get the old-fashioned chalk on the boots. As soon as England have got the ball the wide players
[245.08 - 249.32] P:1828.24 E:0.091069 |  really stretch the pitch. Noticeably already early on England in possession they're trying to make
[249.32 - 253.88] P:1800.45 E:0.099385 |  the pitch as big as they possibly can. England playing from right to left in the first half
[253.88 - 258.84] P:1884.68 E:0.099060 |  and this free kick out there on the right wing Declan Rice to take it. Four England players
[258.84 - 264.92] P:1796.73 E:0.088307 |  gathered around the penalty spot. Anthony Gordon currently standing beyond the defensive line.
[265.56 - 271.48] P:1801.30 E:0.092539 |  Referee Turpan has just actually run across into the penalty area just to have a word with
[272.12 - 276.60] P:1768.69 E:0.100553 |  certainly Esri Konza. Anyway Declan Rice is ready with the free kick into the near post. It's a
[276.60 - 282.04] P:1780.21 E:0.091585 |  poor delivery from Declan Rice and easily cleared away by Vlahovic and England take up possession
[282.04 - 286.20] P:1599.06 E:0.093256 |  again on the halfway line. The England side tonight for Pickford in goal. He's got the ball
[286.20 - 291.64] P:1662.85 E:0.081126 |  right now in fact he's going for another long pass. Pickford looking for Madweke and it's headed
[291.64 - 298.12] P:1611.91 E:0.091592 |  out of play by Berman Cevich for a throw into England over on the right hand side. So Rhys
[298.12 - 304.36] P:1632.20 E:0.083326 |  James, Konza, Gaye and Livremento for the back four with Elliot Anderson second cap here after
[304.36 - 311.00] P:1510.45 E:0.083738 |  he performed so well on Saturday at Villapart. Morgan Rogers coming in, Declan Rice then Madweke
[311.00 - 314.52] P:1618.02 E:0.077598 |  on the right, Gordon on the left and Kane on the bench. What do you think? Well it's the same
[314.52 - 318.76] P:1870.78 E:0.098678 |  formation that we're used to with Thomas Tuchel. He's not going to stray away from the 4-2-3-1. You
[318.76 - 323.72] P:1832.88 E:0.089854 |  can understand the two holding midfielders in games like this. Maybe not so sure about it in the
[323.72 - 328.20] P:1706.38 E:0.084054 |  lesser games where you're looking for more attacking quality to break teams down. But Declan Rice and
[328.20 - 332.04] P:1714.43 E:0.092573 |  Elliot Anderson they seem to be his favourite partnership at the moment and you can see England
[332.04 - 335.88] P:1792.02 E:0.091220 |  have started quite brightly pressed high up the pitch and they are noticeably going longer.
[335.88 - 341.40] P:1604.41 E:0.098645 |  Thomas Tuchel said it was going to be a job as Madweke now takes the ball down the right hand
[341.40 - 347.24] P:1772.82 E:0.097464 |  side and cuts into the penalty area but Berman Cevich went with him and in the end the final
[347.24 - 354.12] P:1776.52 E:0.082446 |  touch was off Madweke and behind for a goal kick. Although I see Madweke there is pointing out
[354.12 - 359.72] P:1627.93 E:0.087280 |  to the assistant on the far side that he feels that he received a tug from the left wing back but
[359.72 - 364.28] P:1676.02 E:0.094742 |  it is a goal kick. There's Berman Cevich wasn't it was checking him back. Madweke did extremely well.
[364.28 - 367.96] P:1731.24 E:0.095760 |  He knew that as soon as he got into the penalty area he couldn't touch him. Slightest of touches
[367.96 - 373.32] P:1640.13 E:0.080399 |  and he went down. It wasn't a foul for me. No. So it is 0-0 very early stages five live this
[373.32 - 379.08] P:1666.59 E:0.081708 |  World Cup qualifier. Choice of listening tonight by the way the Wales Canada game is on sports extra.
[379.08 - 384.60] P:1656.49 E:0.070485 |  You can listen to the commentary on that match on sports extra but England with
[384.60 - 389.72] P:1721.55 E:0.073334 |  Rhys James on the right hand side Rhys James the Chelsea captain who started both matches
[389.72 - 394.04] P:1564.79 E:0.088792 |  this month then back to Mark Gay now who's a little bit of a doubt but has been able to
[394.04 - 401.00] P:1526.00 E:0.085500 |  train Anthony Gordon coming in for Rashford on the left hand side back to Konza now James again
[401.00 - 408.76] P:1760.10 E:0.092234 |  for Madweke down the right hand side. Madweke turns gives it back to Rhys James. Roger's
[408.76 - 414.04] P:1602.66 E:0.093285 |  points that he wanted inside the penalty area but actually England go back to Rice who is now carrying
[414.04 - 418.44] P:1565.93 E:0.089450 |  the ball out towards the right hand side and Madweke goes back to the halfway line. So 0-0
[418.76 - 426.44] P:1642.81 E:0.078716 |  very early stages. I did mention Dragan Stojkovic the great Dragan Stojkovic a former teammate of
[426.44 - 432.36] P:1596.57 E:0.087861 |  Chris Waddles at Marseille. He's a real Serbian footballing hero as James plays the ball to the
[432.36 - 436.60] P:1717.28 E:0.098083 |  edge of the box and that is headed away out of play by Pavlovic for a throw into England's
[436.60 - 441.48] P:1547.46 E:0.082153 |  level with the edge of the penalty area but he was booed Dragan Stojkovic when he came out
[442.36 - 448.28] P:1465.87 E:0.077543 |  from the tunnel and I'm informed that that is because he has publicly supported the
[448.28 - 455.40] P:1439.10 E:0.083455 |  president of Serbia over recent unrest so the crowd have made it plain to him what they think of that
[456.36 - 463.00] P:1474.29 E:0.084001 |  nil-nil with England in possession these floodlight pylons brightly shining down here on what
[463.88 - 469.88] P:1607.17 E:0.087670 |  is a warm evening after a beautiful day here bright sunshine Harry Kane right side of the
[469.88 - 476.04] P:1574.58 E:0.085857 |  penalty area and it's stabbed back by Rodgers now from Elliott Anson out to James whose deep
[476.04 - 481.48] P:1538.75 E:0.086841 |  cross is over everyone inside the penalty area and it's clear away but actually Liv Romendo is able
[481.48 - 486.52] P:1539.52 E:0.083288 |  to take up possession Gordon all Newcastle United for England there then it comes back to the former
[486.52 - 492.68] P:1632.84 E:0.090099 |  Newcastle man Elliott Anderson 25 yards out Elliott Anderson just to his left to Declan Rice then
[492.68 - 497.48] P:1780.90 E:0.098591 |  back to Anderson England dominating the possession Rice on the edge of the box goes for goal but
[497.48 - 503.48] P:1833.90 E:0.088612 |  the shot was more or less straight at goalkeeper Petrovic who was able to drop down to his left
[503.48 - 507.88] P:1815.44 E:0.089622 |  and field it they really have started well England Thomas Tuchel spoke about the high press
[507.88 - 511.96] P:1829.87 E:0.090926 |  started on the front foot we've seen a lot more creativity and urgency in England's play
[511.96 - 516.12] P:1763.26 E:0.097851 |  it is opening five minutes than we did all weekend at Villapar it was started on the front foot yes
[516.12 - 520.04] P:1733.44 E:0.107110 |  they've gone longer the wide players have caused problems and I think with Serbia playing with the
[520.04 - 524.76] P:1905.73 E:0.106247 |  two wing backs very important for England the two wide players occupy those two wing backs and make
[524.76 - 530.04] P:1931.28 E:0.094067 |  them play with a back five. Dusan Vlahovic just miscontrolled the ball there and the reason
[530.04 - 535.16] P:1737.60 E:0.084683 |  you can hear this reaction from the crowd is that having miscontrolled it you then dived into the
[535.16 - 539.72] P:1723.12 E:0.078323 |  challenge with Rhys James and fouled him and actually that could have been nasty for James
[539.72 - 543.96] P:1681.14 E:0.083062 |  and I'm pleased to see that he's okay and hasn't suffered any ill effects. Yeah he looks okay
[543.96 - 548.36] P:1854.86 E:0.083278 |  it's a proper centre forward challenge wasn't it from Vlahovic lost possession midway through in the
[548.36 - 552.84] P:1763.20 E:0.071701 |  England half and the lunge didn't Rhys James unfortunately he's up with the back playing Rhys
[552.84 - 559.40] P:1789.70 E:0.084287 |  James looks okay. Nelnell here in Belgrade England again but the offside flag is up against
[559.40 - 564.60] P:1800.94 E:0.086129 |  Madueke. England have really looked to attack down the right hand side in these early stages but
[564.60 - 570.52] P:1729.53 E:0.073964 |  Madueke just in an offside position. Earlier Republic of Ireland lost for the first time in this
[570.52 - 576.28] P:1677.81 E:0.078503 |  World Qualifying campaign they were beaten 2-1 in the early kickoff in Armenia and a couple of
[576.28 - 585.16] P:1693.16 E:0.088994 |  latest scores Cyprus, Nel, Romania won and in that fascinating group involving Norway and Italy
[585.16 - 591.24] P:1704.32 E:0.094570 |  Norway have got an early lead against Moldova by one goal to Nel. I wonder who scored it
[591.96 - 599.72] P:1858.78 E:0.086999 |  as Rodgers tries to force his way through the middle but is challenged on both sides.
[599.72 - 607.80] P:1816.93 E:0.078135 |  A fair challenge and Serbia have got the ball inside their own half all in blue Serbia,
[607.80 - 614.92] P:1820.15 E:0.064304 |  England all in white and it was Felix Mayra who scored for Norway not you know who.
[615.72 - 620.44] P:1798.70 E:0.081047 |  Is that who you're leaning towards? That wasn't two hours suggesting Paul.
[621.08 - 626.20] P:1736.07 E:0.081418 |  Unusual if he doesn't. So Nel Nel it is Paul Robinson with a seven minutes play but a good
[626.20 - 632.12] P:1667.06 E:0.076828 |  start from England. Thomas Tuchel said in advance of this that he did expect it again for England to be
[633.40 - 643.08] P:1678.81 E:0.080506 |  a task against a 5-4-1 and that's exactly what it's been so far the Serbian back five and England
[643.72 - 648.12] P:1615.27 E:0.095740 |  having so much possession and already really promising attack which ended in that Declan
[648.12 - 651.48] P:1805.46 E:0.093824 |  Reich's shot. And that shows you the possession that England are having because this Serbia team
[651.48 - 655.72] P:1682.50 E:0.089753 |  are a back five. He likes to play the manager with a back three he pushes the wing backs on
[655.80 - 659.88] P:1761.37 E:0.086046 |  and he likes them in advanced areas but the way that Maddoekje and Anthony Gordon have started
[659.88 - 664.04] P:1760.49 E:0.093753 |  is not allowing their full backs to push on and England having a lot of joy in the wide areas
[664.04 - 669.24] P:1879.70 E:0.085023 |  so we are seeing a Serbian team we didn't expect it sat in a low block with a back five.
[669.24 - 675.00] P:1623.87 E:0.084009 |  Serbia Nel England Nel remember they played each other in the first match at the Euros in Germany
[675.00 - 679.80] P:1628.36 E:0.087916 |  last summer but the teams are much changed six changes for Serbia seven for England from that
[679.80 - 684.44] P:1731.30 E:0.097539 |  ball over the top for James to chase on to inside the penalty area but Pavlovich did well
[684.44 - 688.60] P:1719.84 E:0.089710 |  was able to take the ball away from the England right back and put it out of play for what is the
[688.60 - 693.88] P:1677.90 E:0.076196 |  first corner for. Yeah and again another good piece of play from England good passage of play
[693.88 - 700.60] P:1699.13 E:0.077095 |  not over playing not too many passes quite direct this time over the top not over playing already
[700.60 - 704.84] P:1775.46 E:0.091412 |  I mean I know it's early in the game but we see England so many times recycling possession and
[704.84 - 709.08] P:1880.62 E:0.087373 |  keeping possession for possession's sake actually in the early stages we're seeing possession
[709.08 - 713.64] P:1878.24 E:0.088494 |  with a real purpose longer possession cutting out four five six passes playing the one direct
[713.64 - 719.40] P:1853.15 E:0.078361 |  ball over the top so it is Declan Rice with the corner from the right he's already had one
[719.40 - 724.84] P:1758.52 E:0.086495 |  attempt that has set peace which was poorly delivered by his standards but this the corner
[724.84 - 729.96] P:1789.03 E:0.080593 |  and England players grouped around the penalty spot four six of them actually between the penalty
[729.96 - 735.80] P:1734.07 E:0.089323 |  spot and the edge of the six yard box Rice curls it in and that just takes a header away from
[735.80 - 741.16] P:1576.00 E:0.080624 |  Pavlovich out to the edge of the penalty area Livremento was able to take up possession for
[741.16 - 746.52] P:1402.54 E:0.082956 |  England Livremento wearing the number 16 as the left back then Elliot Anderson short pass
[746.52 - 750.92] P:1591.86 E:0.092877 |  to Anthony Gordon Elliot Anderson curls it in that was cleared away right foot volley away by
[750.92 - 756.52] P:1633.87 E:0.083132 |  Milenkovich still inside the Serbia penalty area Anthony Gordon England are all over Serbia here
[756.52 - 762.36] P:1493.24 E:0.088215 |  and then again Anderson does very well under pressure in a tight area Livremento rolls it out
[762.36 - 766.84] P:1641.66 E:0.094259 |  to Anthony Gordon Gordon lucky to cross it but that was blocked away towards the halfway line
[766.84 - 771.80] P:1427.36 E:0.086718 |  nevertheless England come again with Elliot Anderson and then Anthony Gordon and back to the
[771.80 - 776.60] P:1629.12 E:0.084504 |  halfway line extremely impressive high press from England the ball goes into the box from
[776.60 - 780.12] P:1862.93 E:0.098793 |  a Declan Rice corner and then you can see when they lose possession or Serbia try and clear the
[780.12 - 784.60] P:1654.38 E:0.087807 |  ball England they've got it ringed they've got like a circle around the Serbian defence they're
[784.60 - 788.44] P:1716.95 E:0.088812 |  not letting get out they're winning the ball but very quickly and it's been an impressive start from
[788.44 - 794.68] P:1703.81 E:0.081854 |  England Felix Mayram might have scored the first goal for Norway Paul but Erling Harlander scored
[794.68 - 803.96] P:1647.39 E:0.071614 |  the second and they lead Moldova by two goals to nil nil nil here that uh England with the ball
[803.96 - 809.64] P:1752.24 E:0.085285 |  on the halfway line and with this high tempo start that England have made here they come again
[809.64 - 814.60] P:1534.64 E:0.087110 |  Declan Rice Anthony Gordon dropping deep Gordon then playing it into Kane near the penalty area
[814.60 - 820.52] P:1710.32 E:0.093996 |  Kane back centrally to Elliot Anderson over and then have missed control from Madway Kers the ball
[820.52 - 825.40] P:1708.68 E:0.087909 |  was played out to him by Elliot Anderson took his eye off the ball and missed control that out of
[825.40 - 832.04] P:1643.14 E:0.087730 |  play for a throw in Serbia nil England nil five live listen as well via the BBC sounds app wherever
[832.04 - 837.48] P:1614.46 E:0.090881 |  you go to the live radio and if you do that and listen to sports extra you will hear what Molly
[837.48 - 845.16] P:1785.50 E:0.078498 |  Stevens well wheels lucky to have not conceded here actually John Ismail Corny has just had a
[845.16 - 850.04] P:1783.51 E:0.086365 |  shot come off the post no goals yet but what an entertaining game in the early stages really
[850.04 - 856.04] P:1546.77 E:0.089599 |  open free flowing football Wales nil Canada nil England in possession on the halfway line
[856.68 - 861.88] P:1373.20 E:0.089795 |  a whole line of flags hanging rather limply on the top of the stand on the opposite side of the
[861.88 - 869.64] P:1437.28 E:0.083447 |  ground above all of the graffiti I don't think I've ever seen so much graffiti in and on and
[869.64 - 876.92] P:1452.84 E:0.084883 |  outside a football stadium Ian Dennis did the famous walk down the tunnel yesterday here that the
[877.16 - 882.68] P:1557.06 E:0.090107 |  players embarked on tonight and they'll tell you all about that later but it's a feature here
[882.68 - 887.08] P:1516.04 E:0.093357 |  Red Star Belgrade do it as well they don't actually come and warm up on the pitch they warm up on
[887.08 - 891.48] P:1449.38 E:0.087111 |  one of the pitchers outside the stadium so the first time you see them is when they come out of
[891.48 - 896.20] P:1574.34 E:0.093579 |  the the famous tunnel England winning the ball back from Serbia on the halfway line 12 minutes
[896.20 - 903.24] P:1574.12 E:0.084503 |  played still nil nil but the tempo is good as rice goes back to gay and then across to
[903.64 - 908.20] P:1507.77 E:0.090141 |  Esri Konza Dan Burns sitting on the bench tonight with Esri Konza coming in
[908.76 - 917.08] P:1450.39 E:0.080136 |  Reese James and Konza exchange passes there and then Elliot Anderson was telling me on Saturday
[917.08 - 923.16] P:1559.52 E:0.097403 |  night how nervous he was before he made his debut you wouldn't have known it would you as Harry Kane
[923.16 - 930.12] P:1565.09 E:0.083091 |  is able to hold on to the ball and I think someone in the stands blew a whistle there not the referee
[930.12 - 935.48] P:1574.41 E:0.086472 |  and now Madwakie with the ball at his feet on the right hand side two defenders in front of it
[935.48 - 941.00] P:1764.18 E:0.093439 |  still Madwakie ball comes to a stop actually at his feet James back to Anderson then across
[941.00 - 946.36] P:1729.69 E:0.090802 |  the Liverpool mental Liverpool mental to Anthony Gordon in a central position England are being
[946.36 - 953.24] P:1683.38 E:0.094875 |  patient here and Serbia are having to oh that's given away centre field by Elliot Anderson
[953.24 - 958.76] P:1734.36 E:0.097794 |  given away to Glawage now it's being taken forward down the right hand side Glawage though
[958.76 - 962.68] P:1618.49 E:0.098652 |  runs down a blind alley in England are able to win it back and that's a let off earlier Anderson
[962.68 - 966.04] P:1675.03 E:0.098007 |  yeah that's a sloppy piece of play from Elliot Anderson England in really good possession of
[966.04 - 971.08] P:1731.37 E:0.086757 |  the ball he plays a blind ball looks a mark gay in the middle of the park gets there Glawage
[971.08 - 975.48] P:1628.84 E:0.089524 |  intercepts it thankfully for Anderson it comes to nothing but England really are in control of
[975.48 - 979.56] P:1753.67 E:0.084838 |  this game and you can tell by the crowd noise the atmosphere was excellent before the game but
[979.56 - 984.28] P:1531.05 E:0.083065 |  approaching the 15 minute mark they've quietened the crowd down already well Harry Kane who's on the
[984.28 - 989.24] P:1545.93 E:0.096828 |  ball he's been here I was here that day to see Tottenham Pochettino Maritzo Pochettino's Tottenham
[989.24 - 995.08] P:1445.50 E:0.083454 |  win four-nil here they're quietened the crowd that night I can tell you and Gordon and Livremento
[995.08 - 999.48] P:1517.97 E:0.084178 |  again this is all for England on the league on the left hand side Gordon back to Harry Kane Kane
[999.48 - 1004.60] P:1557.19 E:0.087063 |  didn't score on that day by the way even though they won four-nil James right corner of the box
[1004.60 - 1011.08] P:1709.92 E:0.082782 |  Madwakie tries to give him it back but Pavlovich is able to come across and Serbia have got it back
[1011.08 - 1015.32] P:1759.19 E:0.093192 |  and actually was that an offside decision or is that even given as a free kick on the edge of the
[1015.32 - 1021.64] P:1586.37 E:0.088468 |  area to Serbia also when we saw Thomas Tuchel last night Ian asked him if he'd been here before as
[1021.64 - 1029.24] P:1530.94 E:0.083825 |  a manager and he said yes yes I have I won five-nil with PSG against Red Star Belgrade but when he
[1029.24 - 1036.36] P:1704.68 E:0.071249 |  unchecked it this morning we discovered actually it was four-one not five-nil but nevertheless a
[1036.36 - 1041.56] P:1647.34 E:0.089658 |  handsome victory and at the moment this England performance very early on in the match the only
[1041.56 - 1045.80] P:1713.71 E:0.083915 |  thing that is lacking is the goal to go with it I'll be really pleased Thomas Tuchel the way that
[1045.80 - 1049.48] P:1772.29 E:0.086344 |  his team have started I mean Serbia haven't really got the ball this is the first time now
[1049.48 - 1052.68] P:1785.39 E:0.090317 |  they're having a spell of possession they're recycling the ball trying to just keep hold of
[1052.68 - 1056.76] P:1748.16 E:0.097268 |  the ball England have started extremely well pressing high winning the ball back at a really
[1056.76 - 1062.04] P:1676.71 E:0.090436 |  high tempo now Delcovic though takes the ball in from the right hand side Serbia for once in
[1062.04 - 1070.28] P:1611.08 E:0.079565 |  possession inside the England half Ivan Ilich goes back to the excellent Milenkovic I know some
[1070.28 - 1077.64] P:1625.28 E:0.080610 |  of the the regular Serbia watchers feel that for all of the the praise that Mitrovic gets Milenkovic
[1077.64 - 1082.36] P:1559.21 E:0.089043 |  is actually currently the most important player for them the the Nottingham Forest Central Defender
[1082.36 - 1086.84] P:1544.95 E:0.091612 |  that's a risky pass to Mipelkovic he headed it straight into Livremento that could have gone
[1086.84 - 1095.00] P:1703.82 E:0.073568 |  anywhere but it's ended up back with with with Petrovic the goalkeeper who does a pickford
[1095.00 - 1102.36] P:1845.68 E:0.087956 |  hits a long pass over the halfway line they're all at it Paul. Well he spoke quite openly Thomas
[1102.36 - 1106.60] P:1780.96 E:0.091781 |  Tuchel didn't he he said he wanted a high tempo he wanted England to play with a passion with a
[1106.60 - 1112.12] P:1703.71 E:0.083852 |  behind possession and he said he about going long said about the long throw-ins set plays the emphasis
[1112.12 - 1117.56] P:1759.54 E:0.090001 |  on the set plays and we have seen that within the opening 15 minutes of this game. Fuller man Lukic
[1117.56 - 1125.40] P:1789.49 E:0.082136 |  sends a pass a testing pass out towards the far side. Bia Manchavic was struggling to keep it in
[1125.40 - 1129.72] P:1442.59 E:0.078208 |  and actually couldn't keep it in and it's out of play as he tried to to head it back into to play
[1129.72 - 1134.28] P:1515.77 E:0.090134 |  but that also a long pass from center field from the Fuller man Lukic, it's a throwing for England.
[1134.28 - 1137.64] P:1890.35 E:0.086397 |  The midfield is very congested at times when you look at the way that Serbia have set up when
[1137.64 - 1141.56] P:1643.95 E:0.088858 |  those wingbacks do push on into the midfield they've got a five man midfield and with Ryzen
[1141.64 - 1146.04] P:1662.13 E:0.081860 |  Anderson, Madiwecki Rodgers and Anthony Gordon it can be quite congested and that's when England
[1146.04 - 1149.24] P:1616.83 E:0.092691 |  have looked the best when they've got the ball away from that congestion in the middle of the park
[1149.24 - 1155.08] P:1745.21 E:0.100579 |  and got it wide. A little careless by England losing possession from the throw in and Zivkovic
[1155.08 - 1161.88] P:1808.26 E:0.087957 |  has taken it on and forced the corner. Declan Rice went across there to to close him down
[1162.52 - 1168.52] P:1671.36 E:0.081376 |  and Zivkovic played it off in an out of play for a corner for Serbia. Serbia who've got a
[1169.24 - 1175.72] P:1704.21 E:0.089635 |  very very good home record. Corner is taken short and swung into the back post and it I think it
[1175.72 - 1181.48] P:1738.77 E:0.083464 |  took a little glance which took it out into the England left back position. Ivan Ilić now
[1181.48 - 1186.60] P:1824.04 E:0.095231 |  centrally to Nadelkovic who hits the shot but it's deflected which carries it straight through to
[1186.60 - 1191.16] P:1740.97 E:0.081230 |  Pikvod all in yellow who's able to drop forward under the ball. Nadelkovic there who's given
[1191.16 - 1196.52] P:1766.07 E:0.076822 |  quite a lot of time and space, a well-worked set play from Serbia, first real attempt on target
[1196.52 - 1200.84] P:1683.34 E:0.067362 |  from distance, didn't bother Jordan Pikvod. It's like deflection in front of him,
[1200.84 - 1204.84] P:1693.61 E:0.079708 |  Harry Kane it was, he went out to block the shot, easy one for the England goalkeeper.
[1204.84 - 1210.12] P:1555.10 E:0.084084 |  That's Paul Robinson, World Cup goalkeeper for England, Phil Jagialka is with us tonight as well
[1210.12 - 1215.32] P:1532.37 E:0.089036 |  or he's back in the UK, we'll hear from him during the course of the evening but Serbia nil,
[1215.32 - 1222.68] P:1585.21 E:0.066691 |  England nil is the score with just over a quarter of an hour played. Madhwei keg, then back to the
[1222.68 - 1228.28] P:1701.63 E:0.085137 |  halfway line. What about the omission of Marcus Rashford and Ezra tonight Paul? He's shown that
[1228.28 - 1231.96] P:1798.28 E:0.088960 |  he's not afraid to make big decisions Thomas Dirk, as when you look at what he's used he's used the
[1231.96 - 1237.32] P:1736.22 E:0.091764 |  29 players in the five games, rotation and personnel. Here's James swinging the ball in from the right
[1237.32 - 1245.16] P:1753.89 E:0.078952 |  hand side but a stretch by Pavlovic, heads it behind for another corner to England from the right
[1245.24 - 1256.92] P:1900.01 E:0.093024 |  flank, Romania now 2 nil up in Cyprus, so Cyprus nil, Romania 2 and the corner for England,
[1256.92 - 1261.80] P:1797.20 E:0.089877 |  Rhys James and Declan Rice just have a word with one another as Rice carries the ball
[1262.36 - 1270.12] P:1730.63 E:0.081249 |  towards the corner flag and also just makes one or two signals to his teammates in the middle.
[1271.08 - 1276.92] P:1775.23 E:0.093370 |  So again, Rice stands one foot in front of the other and prepares to deliver this corner
[1276.92 - 1281.80] P:1691.07 E:0.088275 |  which comes in now towards the penalty spot, comes off a Serbia head which clears the penalty area,
[1281.80 - 1289.32] P:1816.22 E:0.101078 |  Rhys James, go under pressure, tries to pass it back to Rice and actually Serbia get there first
[1289.32 - 1295.40] P:1785.79 E:0.082940 |  and look to break away downfield, long pass comes off the toe of Rhys James and Jordan
[1295.40 - 1300.20] P:1702.70 E:0.096779 |  Pickford comes out of his penalty area, England trying to play it away from the back which they
[1300.20 - 1305.96] P:1782.32 E:0.098303 |  do effectively, it was slightly here and scarred him and actually Declan Rice's misplaced pass
[1305.96 - 1309.88] P:1846.94 E:0.095994 |  puts it out for a throw to Serbia. An initial calm piece of play there from Jordan Pickford
[1310.44 - 1314.68] P:1736.24 E:0.084605 |  looks like Zivkovic was just about to nip in between him and Rhys James, Jordan Pickford came out
[1314.68 - 1319.40] P:1754.64 E:0.087645 |  of his goal, he was quite decisive, interjected into the situation, played a simple ball to Rhys
[1319.40 - 1324.04] P:1735.17 E:0.099337 |  James but then in turn Declan Rice loses possession, Serbia you feel just growing in confidence.
[1325.56 - 1331.16] P:1737.67 E:0.089259 |  Jordan Pickford incidentally called going for his seventh clean sheet in a roll, kept clean sheets
[1331.16 - 1337.16] P:1618.07 E:0.083921 |  in his last six England appearances which would equal his own and Gordon Banks record for clean
[1337.16 - 1342.36] P:1547.38 E:0.081818 |  sheets in consecutive appearances for England. I feel we're a long way off that yet.
[1342.36 - 1347.40] P:1719.35 E:0.084668 |  He's been excellent though Jordan Pickford, what is he winning this 77, 77, 77 cap tonight?
[1348.36 - 1352.04] P:1676.77 E:0.083589 |  I think he's been an outstanding performer in England in major tournaments,
[1352.04 - 1354.68] P:1734.09 E:0.089521 |  you know there's always been question marks on him but you look at the way he performed it
[1354.68 - 1359.24] P:1736.09 E:0.082894 |  ever in last season, second in this clean sheets chart, I think second or third in the club that
[1359.24 - 1363.88] P:1789.98 E:0.082880 |  once again struggled to stay in the Premier League, I think he's been excellent international level.
[1364.52 - 1371.32] P:1696.88 E:0.083944 |  So the eighth cap tonight that he's winning, second most capped England goalkeeper after
[1371.32 - 1376.76] P:1718.16 E:0.081325 |  Peter Shilton, long ball forward for Serbia but James is able to chest it forward and then
[1376.76 - 1382.92] P:1563.38 E:0.089832 |  James playing it back to Konza who's inside the penalty area. Incidentally one thing I mentioned
[1382.92 - 1387.96] P:1552.38 E:0.086228 |  on Saturday, I did say Dan Byrne that was the first yellow card that England had received during
[1387.96 - 1394.04] P:1534.04 E:0.088702 |  the campaign, in fact Bellingham also received a yellow card but just two yellows so far in the
[1394.04 - 1399.80] P:1485.31 E:0.079481 |  World Cup qualifying group, Pickford playing it to Greece James near the halfway line. Still
[1399.80 - 1409.08] P:1701.32 E:0.076511 |  no no if you've just joined us, 20 minutes played now here on this dry warm evening in Belgrade,
[1409.08 - 1416.04] P:1683.04 E:0.095571 |  fantastic view from here as well, darkness now but you can see the magnificent cathedral on the hill
[1416.04 - 1422.84] P:1630.50 E:0.073629 |  with its green copper dome, white walls and the golden cross on top of it, it is quite a sight.
[1422.84 - 1429.16] P:1554.47 E:0.082179 |  Here is Livremento, playing the ball back to Mark Gaye, square from him to
[1430.84 - 1436.44] P:1579.48 E:0.094325 |  Konza who will now step over the halfway line and roll the ball just deliver it to the feet of
[1436.44 - 1443.48] P:1651.85 E:0.079149 |  Rhys James, hungry of taking the lead against Portugal, Hungry won, Portugal nil, Hungry were the
[1443.48 - 1451.32] P:1724.47 E:0.081921 |  last team to beat Serbia here in this stadium two years ago and they've had some very notable results
[1451.32 - 1457.72] P:1631.46 E:0.090355 |  since then as well, Livremento against some very decent teams and when they've drawn nil nil with
[1457.72 - 1463.16] P:1617.32 E:0.083369 |  Spain here, Gordon taking the ball down the left, turns gives it back to Livremento, Livremento
[1463.24 - 1468.68] P:1623.10 E:0.088821 |  touches from him, being forced away so plays it all the way back towards the halfway line and then
[1468.68 - 1476.20] P:1449.38 E:0.088550 |  Gaye quickly is able to calmly play it across to Konza and England continue to build as we approach
[1476.20 - 1482.76] P:1594.16 E:0.090736 |  the halfway point of the first half here, Madweyke again running at two Serbian defenders, Rhys James
[1482.76 - 1487.16] P:1648.63 E:0.093716 |  behind him, James with the cross to the back post, Rhys with the header but couldn't get any power on it,
[1487.24 - 1493.48] P:1746.86 E:0.090656 |  it bounced down and an easy take for Georgie Petrovic in the six yard box so we are halfway through
[1493.48 - 1499.88] P:1638.15 E:0.089687 |  the first half here in the Rijko Mittic Stadium, Serbia nil, England nil, more from Paul Robinson
[1499.88 - 1504.12] P:1883.80 E:0.087786 |  and then it'll be Ian Dennis. Yeah they've started really well England but you can feel Serbia just
[1504.12 - 1508.44] P:1798.07 E:0.081871 |  about growing in confidence coming into the game, the Serbia manager Belitha, he's desperately trying
[1508.44 - 1512.68] P:1767.16 E:0.084761 |  to get that back five out, he's trying to get his team up the pitch but England at times are in real
[1512.68 - 1516.92] P:1706.67 E:0.076477 |  good comfortable possession and I've been impressed with the way that they've started. I think Thomas
[1516.92 - 1521.96] P:1732.98 E:0.085309 |  Tuchel-Paul will be as well because the England players have carried out his exact wish which was
[1521.96 - 1527.88] P:1753.34 E:0.084300 |  to try to control the crowd by keeping the ball and for that they have been very very dominant
[1527.88 - 1532.92] P:1710.39 E:0.090173 |  for the first quarter of this game, it is nil nil, Serbia against England a world-class qualifier,

[1538.76 - 1544.28] P:1774.34 E:0.087377 |  they're playing from right to left as Gordon makes a run forward and Milinkovic will just hold him off
[1544.28 - 1548.92] P:1877.59 E:0.093876 |  as the goalkeeper Petrovic, a Bournemouth of course after signing that five-year deal
[1548.92 - 1554.92] P:1762.95 E:0.083964 |  picks it up for his ninth cap in the in the Serbian goal but it's a different feel I've
[1554.92 - 1559.48] P:1743.92 E:0.092131 |  got to say to when you've been here in this stadium for a Champions League night I was here 2018
[1560.12 - 1565.32] P:1809.84 E:0.093682 |  famous night they beat Liverpool by two goals to nil it was a frenzied atmosphere I've got to say
[1565.88 - 1570.76] P:1675.10 E:0.087625 |  it felt in contrast a lot more sedate not much of a not the same level of an edge
[1571.56 - 1575.96] P:1752.43 E:0.103190 |  with the national side although when they do get behind their side as they now come forward over
[1575.96 - 1583.00] P:1808.73 E:0.081517 |  on that far side they will raise their voices and can still create a real racket inside this
[1583.00 - 1591.00] P:1918.28 E:0.094935 |  ball-like arena that holds just under 52,000 but as John has already said 8,000 empty seats a partial
[1591.00 - 1596.92] P:1768.96 E:0.092952 |  closure in the end next to the England fans away towards our right hand side as now here is Rice
[1596.92 - 1601.56] P:1816.45 E:0.081649 |  coming forward and he just slows his run as he passes the ball in towards Harry Kane the captain
[1601.56 - 1607.40] P:1785.04 E:0.087855 |  who drops off into the centre circle Gordon is in a central area lays it out towards James forward
[1607.40 - 1612.60] P:1748.26 E:0.088076 |  now to Maddoeka on the front foot Maddoeka with a cross on the run headed up by Milinkovic Gordon
[1612.60 - 1619.32] P:1841.42 E:0.079071 |  is there and then the ball is hooked forwards and it goes off target and out for a goal kicks we'll
[1619.32 - 1625.56] P:1878.46 E:0.074390 |  get an update in that game as Swansea with Molly Stevens watching Wales Canada. Yes,
[1625.56 - 1630.12] P:2064.77 E:0.099161 |  it's been a lively first 20 minutes or so Ian things have settled a little bit more here now
[1630.12 - 1634.28] P:1990.62 E:0.094060 |  though some good chances for Wales Daniel James found space in the penalty area but the
[1634.84 - 1640.28] P:2034.44 E:0.084257 |  Canada keeper was so close to save it and another one where James crossed for David Brooks but he
[1640.28 - 1645.16] P:1829.64 E:0.077247 |  missed the volley for now is goalless. Thank you Molly commentary if that continues on sports

[1672.68 - 1680.60] P:1867.49 E:0.083612 |  shoots pushed away forcefully by Petrovic he's around head height as I think Zipkovic has gone
[1680.68 - 1685.72] P:1859.34 E:0.088263 |  down and that'll be a free kick to Serbia it was a direct strike right at the goalkeeper Paul
[1685.72 - 1689.80] P:1909.85 E:0.078111 |  his first real opportunity that England have had first clear sight of goal for all the pressure
[1689.80 - 1693.56] P:1847.13 E:0.078085 |  for the pressing that they've done excellently well it was Anthony Gordon this time cutting in off
[1693.56 - 1697.48] P:1922.64 E:0.082391 |  the left hand side as you were expecting to just opened up in front of him and he got a decent
[1697.48 - 1701.48] P:1911.96 E:0.080747 |  strike on the ball but unfortunately for him in England it was straight at Petrovic easy one
[1701.48 - 1706.20] P:1870.06 E:0.087883 |  for the goalkeeper but he made it look difficult just put two palms on it pushed it 25 yards away
[1707.00 - 1714.44] P:1698.91 E:0.076011 |  they've gone over eight hours without conceding at home have Serbia you know they have gone two
[1714.44 - 1721.16] P:1840.62 E:0.085200 |  years since their last tastered defeat September 23 against Hungary France Nyl Iceland one is the
[1721.16 - 1729.16] P:1786.59 E:0.096866 |  latest score and Albania are leading Latvia by a goal to nil in England's group group K and Albania
[1729.88 - 1736.68] P:1840.89 E:0.084503 |  only two points behind Serbia and they meet here next month and that's why the
[1736.68 - 1742.28] P:1699.53 E:0.086978 |  Serbian FA have been quite fearful really about fan behaviour and they really have gone to great
[1742.28 - 1747.96] P:1802.50 E:0.080255 |  lengths to talk about making sure everybody is on their best behaviour no more transgressions
[1747.96 - 1752.52] P:1720.58 E:0.082129 |  that we've seen in the past talk about that partial closure because they they are fearful
[1753.24 - 1758.44] P:1700.32 E:0.089700 |  that the game against Albania would then be played behind closed doors and that's why they
[1758.44 - 1765.24] P:1746.77 E:0.078411 |  have been several messages and statements issued by all sorts of high-ranking officials and the
[1765.24 - 1771.00] P:1576.65 E:0.085195 |  Serbian FA to the supporters ahead of this game as England get a free kick for a push on Gordon
[1771.00 - 1774.76] P:1632.66 E:0.093667 |  well thankfully we've had no incidents thus far in the game but there is a pest in the crowd
[1774.76 - 1778.84] P:1787.89 E:0.084859 |  somewhere with a whistle we keep hearing it every time that they think that Serbia should have a
[1778.84 - 1782.76] P:1681.97 E:0.087960 |  free kick there's a real loud blast on a whistle from somewhere in the crowd and it has affected
[1782.76 - 1789.56] P:1572.17 E:0.087740 |  the players on a number of occasions also the England players were having a green laser directed
[1789.56 - 1794.84] P:1606.71 E:0.090846 |  at them during the warm-up ahead of the game as concert plays the ball to feet nice turn by
[1794.84 - 1800.92] P:1807.56 E:0.101568 |  Rogers in towards Madaweca Madaweca and it falls to Harry Kane and he can't prod it goalwards
[1802.36 - 1807.16] P:1819.98 E:0.093782 |  there was a lunge came in Harry Kane saying it should have been a corner kick has left footed
[1807.16 - 1812.52] P:1792.40 E:0.091748 |  from close range it just runs wide at the left hand post and once again that whistle was ever
[1812.76 - 1817.64] P:1822.92 E:0.085298 |  poor wasn't it oh first glance it's like a real glaring miss from Harry Kane Madaweca again does
[1817.64 - 1821.80] P:1862.66 E:0.078380 |  brilliantly well down the right hand side he puts the ball across with his right foot it's deflected
[1821.80 - 1825.72] P:1848.01 E:0.078061 |  into the path of Kane and I think he's just put off by the dive in Petrovic at his feet
[1825.72 - 1829.72] P:1916.49 E:0.086413 |  two or three yards out Harry Kane you think all day long he's going to score goalkeeper does really
[1829.72 - 1833.24] P:1890.11 E:0.082972 |  well he's right Harry Kane goalkeeper gets a little block on it it should have been a corner to
[1833.24 - 1840.76] P:1716.93 E:0.071724 |  England well he missed the chance to equal his own record of scoring in six successive games
[1840.76 - 1849.00] P:1593.54 E:0.079848 |  against Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday and the England captain going close here in Belgrade

[1854.44 - 1860.60] P:1675.24 E:0.091683 |  Lahavic presses Pickford Anderson gives Pickford an out and then the ball out from gay he forward
[1860.60 - 1866.20] P:1786.61 E:0.093909 |  towards Rogers Rogers looks for the run of Gordon down the middle here is Gordon Madaweca in support
[1866.20 - 1872.92] P:1822.13 E:0.089979 |  Gordon will go alone and Petrovic makes the save low down to his right one handed kept alive by
[1872.92 - 1880.60] P:1716.26 E:0.078879 |  Livremento back towards Harry Kane England are creating openings full forward towards James back
[1880.60 - 1887.16] P:1804.99 E:0.096795 |  towards Harry Kane Harry Kane goes down inside the D and a direct free kick is awarded to England
[1887.16 - 1895.32] P:1848.64 E:0.079379 |  and a yellow card is shown as well and that was to Sasa Lukic and the fuller midfielder
[1896.68 - 1905.40] P:1729.01 E:0.075529 |  will now be suspended for their next World Cup qualifier against Albania that crucial game
[1906.04 - 1911.72] P:1740.66 E:0.078546 |  so Lukic will be suspended and England now with a free kick in the D the really poor challenge
[1911.72 - 1915.88] P:1728.95 E:0.082554 |  there from Lukic Harry Kane was just about to pull the trigger got a clean sight the goal
[1915.88 - 1920.44] P:1815.66 E:0.085405 |  England got a free kick right inside the D two yards from the edge of the box possibly too close
[1920.44 - 1924.20] P:1819.30 E:0.081121 |  but there's a number of players standing over it debating who's going to take it but this is on
[1924.20 - 1928.44] P:1672.46 E:0.082741 |  the back of yet again another good piece of build-up play from England Anthony Gordon was
[1928.44 - 1932.52] P:1851.56 E:0.085747 |  through one on one with Petrovic who made a really good save on a difficult angle for Gordon
[1932.52 - 1937.32] P:1853.68 E:0.083835 |  he choose to take this shot on quite early probably 15 16 yards out on the angle to the right of the
[1937.32 - 1942.44] P:1753.72 E:0.075312 |  goal Petrovic dives to his right hand side makes a big save with his right hand came to nothing
[1942.44 - 1946.28] P:1779.50 E:0.090018 |  in the end but once again England recycled possession got the ball back into Harry Kane
[1946.28 - 1951.80] P:1812.54 E:0.086306 |  and they've worked this free kick Cyprus won Romania two so Cyprus have got a goal back now this free
[1951.80 - 1958.92] P:1824.85 E:0.076840 |  kick is slap bang in the centre of the D must be awkward for the goalkeeper because you've got
[1959.48 - 1965.72] P:1939.25 E:0.091997 |  James if he wants to go with the right foot Madaweca potentially with his left
[1968.20 - 1974.76] P:1935.72 E:0.084980 |  and he's not going to get much of a side to this because every Serbian royal blue shirt is back in
[1974.76 - 1979.40] P:1914.02 E:0.084760 |  their penalty area you can't say in this situation as a goalkeeper you really are struggling to see
[1979.40 - 1984.04] P:1940.74 E:0.083092 |  you've got to put pick a gap through shirts through two players try and put your end man in the
[1984.04 - 1988.36] P:1966.44 E:0.087847 |  wall trying to give it half a night half an inch to see really difficult position for a goalkeeper
[1989.00 - 1995.08] P:1869.43 E:0.088811 |  England have got their own little wall of three inside the penalty area Conce is going to join
[1995.08 - 1999.80] P:1894.93 E:0.089449 |  on that as well in fact no he's just having a word in the ear of Harry Kane to expect Harry Kane to
[1999.80 - 2006.36] P:1910.51 E:0.099413 |  move away either reach James or Madaweca 0-0 5 live in Belgrade it's James fires it in might fall
[2006.44 - 2010.92] P:1855.51 E:0.091407 |  towards Harry Kane England are appealing for a penalty that of course we looked at by VAR
[2011.64 - 2015.80] P:1708.73 E:0.082195 |  comes out to the edge of the centre circle Livremento to Gordon Gordon now on this near
[2015.80 - 2022.04] P:1796.67 E:0.078745 |  side the left tries to go on the outside of Illich his cross is delivered deep towards the far post
[2022.60 - 2026.12] P:1663.82 E:0.091206 |  headed away at the far post picked up by Madaweca though for England all in white
[2026.92 - 2032.92] P:1863.66 E:0.075945 |  England clearly this is the the best performance in the early stages of the Thomas Tuchel reign
[2033.88 - 2038.76] P:1743.72 E:0.086804 |  James now with a cross on the right take city flexion and Petrovich has to dive down at his
[2038.76 - 2044.60] P:1684.91 E:0.078143 |  near post can't prevent it from going out for another England corner kick good spell of pressure
[2044.60 - 2048.84] P:1664.69 E:0.103138 |  good spell of possession from England keeping the press on high winning the ball back in the right
[2048.84 - 2054.36] P:1712.63 E:0.087954 |  areas looking again at the Reese James free kick very very crowded penalty area it does look like
[2054.36 - 2058.92] P:1813.74 E:0.083001 |  it strikes the hand of Maxim Kovic in the middle of the penalty area referee deemed it was too
[2058.92 - 2062.92] P:1764.60 E:0.083040 |  close there's too many bodies there in front the goalkeeper difficult one for Reese James to get
[2062.92 - 2071.24] P:1730.02 E:0.076892 |  a shot on target with all those men in front of him Clément Tertin the French referee who is in a

[2080.44 - 2085.00] P:1651.24 E:0.092573 |  it's a VAR has clearly had a look at that penalty appeal for England and it's dismissed it corner
[2085.00 - 2089.80] P:1771.82 E:0.102245 |  kick to be taken on that far side the right it will be an out swinger from Declan Rice Serbia
[2089.80 - 2096.44] P:1749.85 E:0.091144 |  have every blue shirt back in it comes now and the goal is headed and there is Harry Kane the

[2101.80 - 2108.44] P:1770.43 E:0.086293 |  again England's captain with the opening goal and it's a goal that is thoroughly deserved

[2114.84 - 2118.60] P:1746.82 E:0.100397 |  been banging on the door of England played extremely well really impressed with the way
[2118.60 - 2122.76] P:1704.41 E:0.098909 |  that England have approached this game and it come from a set play over on the far side it's
[2122.76 - 2127.16] P:1846.07 E:0.097247 |  an out swinging corner from Declan Rice there's a lot of Mellio bodies in the middle of the 18

[2145.48 - 2151.40] P:1757.89 E:0.078662 |  going to follow Harry Kane if he drops deep we'll just leave him but I can't believe that nobody
[2151.40 - 2155.16] P:1753.44 E:0.084162 |  has picked him up inside that penalty area completely left him didn't he I mean that's taking it to
[2155.16 - 2160.52] P:1779.61 E:0.086724 |  extremes I mean a player in a manner of his caliber and his goal score in Pro S isn't
[2160.52 - 2164.92] P:1813.45 E:0.090989 |  marked from corners we understand how you mark zones etc but you mark the centre forward you
[2164.92 - 2169.00] P:1828.39 E:0.089722 |  mark the danger man Harry Kane had the freedom of the penalty area but listen it's still a great
[2169.00 - 2174.44] P:1806.53 E:0.085981 |  header he had to stoop he got power behind the ball 12 yards out directed inside the post really
[2174.44 - 2182.36] P:1733.28 E:0.069347 |  good headed finish something like just over eight hours and 20 minutes of football for the first
[2182.36 - 2188.36] P:1763.36 E:0.093625 |  time now they've conceded at home since Desperdorf scored for Bulgaria in a two-all draw in November
[2188.36 - 2193.80] P:1868.65 E:0.085881 |  2023 and they've had some notable results during that period as well the nation's league
[2194.36 - 2201.00] P:1690.82 E:0.079306 |  in the in the top league incidentally they held Denmark and Spain to goal a straws at home they
[2201.00 - 2207.56] P:1821.41 E:0.080596 |  beat Switzerland 2-0 so some good opposition have come to Serbia and have not been able
[2208.68 - 2216.52] P:1729.70 E:0.080795 |  to breach that Serbian back line but England have played well they're dominated and from a set piece

[2224.68 - 2228.68] P:1743.36 E:0.094330 |  took it really well as well didn't he just looking at the replays again his movement was minimal in
[2228.68 - 2233.24] P:1777.48 E:0.082802 |  the 18 year old box he didn't have to do a lot it's a really really good delivery from Declan Rice
[2233.24 - 2238.44] P:1664.86 E:0.075605 |  a pace a bend on it found the England skipper good header tucked it away inside the left hand post
[2238.44 - 2242.76] P:1603.26 E:0.079189 |  and no more than England deserved because they have been the better team so that's his record as a
[2242.76 - 2248.60] P:1788.05 E:0.091832 |  captain but it's 74 goals now in 109 as the ball is flicked forward by Rodgers and Madowakia
[2248.60 - 2254.60] P:1772.34 E:0.098107 |  with acceleration into the penalty area what a goal by not in Madowakia it's his first for his country
[2255.80 - 2262.36] P:1654.56 E:0.094900 |  and he will remember that for many a year because he latched onto the flick by Rodgers
[2262.36 - 2269.24] P:1774.01 E:0.084684 |  he attacked the Serbian defense with pace and a nonchalant finish and England have scored two

[2299.56 - 2304.76] P:1834.38 E:0.094535 |  Madowakia just lifts it over the onrussian goalkeeper and this is better from England this is what we've
[2304.76 - 2311.40] P:1835.51 E:0.078176 |  wanted to see a really good performance they did say didn't they yesterday that because we might see
[2311.40 - 2316.52] P:1851.09 E:0.090125 |  a better a true version of ourselves you know they've been criticised it's been underwhelming
[2317.40 - 2321.88] P:1793.30 E:0.094702 |  but they are certainly putting in an excellent performance I can see that green laser
[2322.44 - 2327.96] P:1689.77 E:0.092288 |  pen being directed once again at some of the England players on the pitch as it was flashing away on
[2327.96 - 2337.08] P:1692.44 E:0.074132 |  that left hand side but two goals in rapid fire time and England in full control he's been a real
[2337.08 - 2341.72] P:1703.69 E:0.080862 |  threat Madowakia ever since the game started down that right hand side and it was Morgan Rodgers
[2341.72 - 2345.64] P:1905.90 E:0.087872 |  he's on a number of occasions he's put Anthony Gordon in twice and it was the same type of
[2345.64 - 2349.64] P:1850.77 E:0.087704 |  touch from in the outside of his right boot the tiniest of touches that took the midfielder out
[2349.64 - 2353.24] P:1794.80 E:0.086293 |  to play Madowakia rushed on to it and it was a really really good finish
[2355.16 - 2360.44] P:1671.91 E:0.100330 |  Erling Harland is on the score sheet again as Norway now lead Moldova by three goals to nil
[2362.44 - 2368.04] P:1821.42 E:0.095788 |  first visit to Belgrade since Serbia became an independent nation in 2006

[2392.20 - 2398.68] P:1747.36 E:0.080257 |  and Serbia haven't really posed much of a danger to Jordan Pickford as Portugal
[2399.24 - 2404.76] P:1604.41 E:0.096946 |  have equalised Hungary won Portugal won Bernardo Silva has got that goal earlier in group half

[2417.32 - 2422.68] P:1771.16 E:0.095707 |  pen is just flashing at the feast of Jordan Pickford all in yellow as he bides his time
[2424.44 - 2430.92] P:1744.89 E:0.097270 |  you might recall in the opening game at Euro 2024 Serbia won red this season they have
[2431.40 - 2438.04] P:1783.93 E:0.077755 |  changed to the royal blue it's historically a significant colour for Serbia key colour in the
[2438.04 - 2444.20] P:1779.41 E:0.074478 |  flag it's associated with freedom faith and the sky but now I think
[2447.64 - 2452.92] P:1612.02 E:0.090791 |  that eye the laser pen has gone in the eye of Esri Konza and the referee has come across
[2453.64 - 2456.68] P:1781.89 E:0.081564 |  to have a word with the fourth official Stephanie Frappar
[2457.40 - 2462.28] P:1741.70 E:0.072202 |  he immediately stopped Konza Jordan Pickford rolled the ball out to midway through the
[2462.28 - 2466.68] P:1888.94 E:0.081138 |  England half and immediately Konza just stopped and you could see the flash on his shirt put his
[2466.68 - 2470.52] P:1801.98 E:0.089915 |  hand to his eyes and it's been a problem the whole first half we said about the whistle that's been
[2470.52 - 2475.00] P:1654.71 E:0.088896 |  there the laser pen it was a clear clear green laser pen he must have flashed right in Konza's eye
[2475.00 - 2479.16] P:1865.91 E:0.089224 |  he immediately stopped held his face referee as you say came over to this near touch line
[2479.16 - 2485.96] P:1547.38 E:0.082355 |  and reported it to the fourth official well Franco Rodoicov who's the the secretary general
[2485.96 - 2492.68] P:1540.60 E:0.088232 |  of the Serbian FA did say yes in the match program every inappropriate reaction insults or
[2492.68 - 2498.20] P:1762.39 E:0.089135 |  incident could cost us dearly he wants the supporters to be loud and dignified he wants
[2498.20 - 2503.80] P:1771.42 E:0.079498 |  it to be a source of strength not a risk for the national side it'll be interesting to see
[2505.00 - 2508.36] P:1621.55 E:0.094789 |  what happens regarding that because that was clearly been brought to the attention
[2508.92 - 2513.40] P:1730.03 E:0.098394 |  of the referees the ball goes long up towards Rogers who certainly played his part in that
[2513.48 - 2517.16] P:1683.46 E:0.078051 |  second goal with that depth little flick into the path of Maddoe Aker
[2517.16 - 2522.84] P:1728.24 E:0.095015 |  Harry Kane volleys the ball forward it reaches Gordon then he brings down
[2523.72 - 2529.24] P:1814.34 E:0.089995 |  Nedelkovich and there is no oh yes there is going to be a yellow card shown to the Newcastle
[2529.24 - 2534.68] P:1763.04 E:0.081648 |  player so the first England player is booked Anthony Gordon here tonight we got five minutes to go
[2534.68 - 2537.80] P:1596.18 E:0.080113 |  to halftime yeah they've been really impressive England haven't they I mean you can't give them
[2537.80 - 2541.40] P:1719.34 E:0.081223 |  enough praise for what Thomas Tupola said I like the way that they've mixed it up
[2541.40 - 2544.52] P:1779.38 E:0.086983 |  yes they've gone long they showed their intentions immediately from the kickoff
[2544.52 - 2548.60] P:1699.17 E:0.085995 |  when Jordan Pickford launched it into the Serbia penalty box direct from the kickoff
[2548.60 - 2552.52] P:1756.29 E:0.086749 |  and during the game they've got players wide they've stretched the pitch they've pressed high
[2552.52 - 2557.08] P:1751.40 E:0.083781 |  the tempo has been excellent and there's been a real mixture of keeping possession in good areas
[2557.08 - 2559.80] P:1777.08 E:0.080892 |  and also going long and more direct and causing problems.
[2559.80 - 2564.20] P:1674.44 E:0.090756 |  Melinkovic hammers the ball away downfield James though was there he was actually applauded
[2564.20 - 2570.60] P:1699.19 E:0.085057 |  for being so alert by Thomas Tucco Livremento has his heels clipped he tumbles over lands rather
[2570.60 - 2575.80] P:1724.75 E:0.089878 |  awkwardly England get a free kick just over the halfway line as they play from right to left as we
[2575.80 - 2581.80] P:1758.30 E:0.083212 |  look four and a half minutes to go to the break and the two and a half thousand England supporters
[2585.16 - 2593.40] P:1972.74 E:0.089132 |  are in good voice as I would imagine that that is the Tanoi announcement saying about the green
[2593.40 - 2599.24] P:1919.00 E:0.078496 |  laser pen how's your Serbian is your Serbian not up to scratch no the translation I think it is
[2599.24 - 2603.64] P:1814.50 E:0.091866 |  absolutely right that he was greeted with a chorus of boos from the home section so you can only
[2603.64 - 2610.84] P:1709.61 E:0.085394 |  presume that that's indeed what it was. Also Slobodan from BBC Serbia is still with us he says
[2610.84 - 2616.60] P:1805.64 E:0.088604 |  there's pyros as well that they're actually asking them not to to use those two inside the at the
[2616.60 - 2625.24] P:1763.23 E:0.072972 |  ground so other than that Paul my Serbian spot on it was a good guess Gordon to James James and
[2625.24 - 2629.16] P:1637.53 E:0.085693 |  matter of fact not quite on the same wavelength move breaks down on that far side behind it goes
[2629.16 - 2633.64] P:1790.68 E:0.095642 |  for a goal kick England still lead then to nil and Molly Stevens watching Wales Canada.
[2634.84 - 2640.68] P:1913.32 E:0.086878 |  Yeah where Canada have broken the deadlock Ian Derek Cornelius with a stunning free kick which
[2640.68 - 2646.36] P:1945.47 E:0.088407 |  Adam Davis just couldn't get a hand to it nestles into the top right hand corner it's Wales nil
[2646.36 - 2652.68] P:1786.27 E:0.072139 |  Canada one. Thank you Molly sports extra for that in fact Wales will be England's next opponents
[2652.68 - 2659.56] P:1722.57 E:0.085580 |  because they play a friendly in early October before travelling to Latvia as they will continue
[2659.56 - 2663.96] P:1734.58 E:0.097889 |  their world-class qualifying campaign as they're looking for a fifth straight win still yet to
[2663.96 - 2671.64] P:1861.65 E:0.085593 |  concede remember here is Zipkovic picks the ball up gets it in low referee has I think already
[2671.64 - 2675.72] P:1715.83 E:0.090259 |  blown his whistle for a free kick he was an offside flags up England free kick inside the penalty
[2675.72 - 2680.12] P:1695.06 E:0.087012 |  area. Does really well there as Rikonda initially slipped lost his foot in but might as to close
[2680.20 - 2684.76] P:1685.08 E:0.081760 |  the gap between him and Zipkovic England back four they've done well they've protected Jordan
[2684.76 - 2689.96] P:1768.76 E:0.074937 |  Pickford's goal as well as contributing to the forward play it's been a good performance all
[2689.96 - 2696.36] P:1749.85 E:0.070504 |  around from England. Well with Albania leading England Tuna look they'll be going seven points
[2696.36 - 2701.72] P:1802.46 E:0.078771 |  clear at the top of group A. Erling Harland has scored a hat trick a first half hat trick as now
[2701.72 - 2707.24] P:1730.49 E:0.092393 |  Norway lead mould over by four goals to nil. Pickford then with a goal kick all in yellow
[2707.32 - 2713.88] P:1755.17 E:0.085964 |  two and a half minutes to go to halftime BBC Radio five live this time next week the champions league
[2713.88 - 2719.16] P:1725.51 E:0.094983 |  is back we will have three successive nights for you of Europe's elite competition will be live in
[2719.16 - 2725.80] P:1694.03 E:0.088247 |  Bilbao London Bayern Munich and Newcastle United for four commentaries on five live on Tuesday
[2725.80 - 2733.48] P:1755.64 E:0.078931 |  Wednesday and Thursday of next week. To nil went to England back it goes to to Pickford
[2734.44 - 2740.44] P:1773.14 E:0.076959 |  but they've had an element of control from the first whistle. They've been really impressive you
[2740.44 - 2745.00] P:1663.94 E:0.073252 |  can't heap enough praise on them everything we spoke about before the game that we haven't seen
[2745.00 - 2748.76] P:1776.65 E:0.081236 |  and what Thomas Tuchel said that he wanted from his side they've delivered you know they've gone
[2748.76 - 2752.44] P:1801.00 E:0.083986 |  out here tonight with the manager's words ringing in their ears the tactical approach what he said
[2752.44 - 2756.28] P:1831.56 E:0.080115 |  about like going slightly longer and they've done that and they've done it effectively they've played
[2756.28 - 2760.60] P:1777.26 E:0.082372 |  in the right areas and there's been a real good mixture the test now for this team is where do
[2760.60 - 2764.52] P:1860.79 E:0.087617 |  they go do they go on and score more goals do they try and see the game out from an England
[2764.52 - 2768.28] P:1638.81 E:0.086300 |  fans point of view the way that they've played you now want to see them press on and go and get
[2768.28 - 2772.76] P:1705.16 E:0.084015 |  more goals and keep doing what they're doing don't create their own problems. The Romento looks
[2772.76 - 2777.40] P:1700.61 E:0.082229 |  comfortable doesn't he? The Newcastle defender? Yeah I mean me and John Sawyer met the weekend
[2777.40 - 2781.48] P:1615.00 E:0.081294 |  Newcastle leads last weekend and I thought he was brilliant down the left hand side a lot when
[2781.48 - 2787.00] P:1583.36 E:0.075164 |  he played even higher advanced Newcastle had like a hybrid back four back five and the Romento
[2787.00 - 2790.68] P:1627.71 E:0.082738 |  was the one that was allowed to push on and obviously with Lewis Skelly not being on the
[2790.68 - 2793.96] P:1631.34 E:0.084611 |  plane and not making the squad it's an opportunity for the Livromento this evening.
[2793.96 - 2800.20] P:1629.21 E:0.080601 |  Only his second start just his third cap for Tino Livromento. Rice slows it down Anderson
[2800.20 - 2806.76] P:1737.08 E:0.083008 |  Harry Kane again drops off Consul will play the ball across to Gehi playing on the left hand side
[2807.48 - 2812.36] P:1758.79 E:0.091264 |  of that central defensive partnership with the Esri Consul one of four changes that Thomas Tuchel
[2812.36 - 2818.28] P:1638.63 E:0.087704 |  made inside the last 60 seconds of normal time and England through a Harry Kane header and Noddy
[2818.28 - 2825.40] P:1771.11 E:0.077460 |  Madowekers first goal for England are leading by two goals to nil as almost coming to a standstill
[2825.40 - 2830.68] P:1674.90 E:0.079832 |  is Consul just plays the ball out towards Declan Rice James is ahead of him and then that ball
[2830.68 - 2836.84] P:1740.04 E:0.087675 |  has been stubbed wide by by Reese James it'll go out for a a Serbia throw but the exception of
[2836.84 - 2842.20] P:1690.20 E:0.079610 |  possibly an Anderson mistake it has been almost error free from England. The only time that
[2842.20 - 2846.12] P:1807.57 E:0.089930 |  England have looked in any danger was through their own doing as you say Anderson giving away
[2846.12 - 2850.76] P:1736.00 E:0.084924 |  possession is dangerous area a couple of sloppy misplaced passes but other than that it has been
[2850.76 - 2856.28] P:1760.83 E:0.087794 |  an error free performance and Rice charging through the the midfield pressing as the ball
[2856.28 - 2862.44] P:1702.42 E:0.085680 |  goes back towards Geordi Petrovic the Bournemouth goalkeeper one minute of added on time that we
[2862.44 - 2869.80] P:1680.49 E:0.070274 |  are being played now for that additional period here in Belgrade and England will be going in at
[2869.80 - 2875.96] P:1796.93 E:0.082530 |  half time by two goals to nil and when they took the lead against Senegal in June and it's the only
[2875.96 - 2885.00] P:1828.18 E:0.079320 |  defeat in 47 games where they've scored first and lost going all the way back to 2019 and it's a route
[2885.00 - 2890.84] P:1668.45 E:0.094440 |  in Norway Norway five Moldova nil Martin Urdogan in injury time has got that latest goal
[2891.40 - 2895.88] P:1778.45 E:0.089433 |  Malinkovic of Noddingham Forest the Serbian captain coming forward carrying the ball into the
[2895.88 - 2901.00] P:1801.46 E:0.086176 |  England half Zivkovic is able to turn along the ground this is Lajevic can I get the shot away
[2901.00 - 2906.84] P:1783.52 E:0.084253 |  you can it was a dipping effort left footed off target goal kick England 2-0 yeah Morgan Rogers
[2906.84 - 2911.24] P:1723.24 E:0.077730 |  did well there tracks track back helps his defenders out track Blarovic all the way back
[2911.24 - 2914.44] P:1792.01 E:0.100132 |  five yards outside the edge of the box couldn't really get a clean shot on Jordan Pickford's
[2914.44 - 2918.60] P:1924.19 E:0.104618 |  goal and that's the only real attempt that they've had Serbia a really impressive first half from
[2918.60 - 2922.60] P:1795.15 E:0.098020 |  England and that was the last bit of action as well because that Lajevic effort there was no
[2922.60 - 2928.68] P:1870.78 E:0.087352 |  time to take the goal kick the halftime whistle has sounded and England are taking a significant
[2928.68 - 2935.32] P:1875.68 E:0.092361 |  stride towards the World Cup next summer because for what was billed as the toughest test in group
[2935.32 - 2941.56] P:1785.92 E:0.086507 |  K well they are making it look very very comfortable indeed because a goal from Harry Kane followed
[2941.56 - 2948.92] P:1773.45 E:0.084486 |  up by Maddoek has shot on the run and England will head back down that long tunnel all 240 meters of
[2948.92 - 2955.48] P:1784.01 E:0.086840 |  it in a very very good place indeed the Serbia supporters are not happy they are disgruntled
[2955.48 - 2960.44] P:1819.67 E:0.081483 |  you can hear that in the background because the halftime score in Belgrade is Serbia 0
[2960.44 - 2966.68] P:1730.24 E:0.077425 |  England 2 Kelly thank you very much to Ian Dennis Paul Robinson and John Murray watching on in
[2966.68 - 2971.88] P:1811.23 E:0.094866 |  Belgrade also with us former England defender Phil Jagielka Phil is that closer to what England
[2971.88 - 2976.60] P:1774.94 E:0.080429 |  fans have been asking for yeah definitely I think the first 20 minutes to us all feeling it out but
[2976.60 - 2981.08] P:1641.22 E:0.102260 |  after that there's only been one team looking to score a goal and thankfully the captain came
[2981.08 - 2986.28] P:1587.85 E:0.107938 |  up with a header then after that we've played some decent football and fantastic flowing move for
[2986.28 - 2990.52] P:1623.87 E:0.092890 |  the for the second and hopefully if Serbia potentially come out a little bit to try and get
[2990.52 - 2995.08] P:1771.45 E:0.093298 |  back in the game we can hopefully get some more goals yeah Harry Kane on the on the score sheet
[2995.08 - 2999.96] P:1581.56 E:0.088379 |  again normal service resumed after not scoring against Andorra it was ages wasn't he not scored
[3000.20 - 3006.60] P:1585.52 E:0.097590 |  it's a drought I had plenty of that one in school very many so I had about three year droughts
[3007.32 - 3011.24] P:1476.56 E:0.094559 |  yeah well to be fair you weren't England's number nine that wasn't the job again yeah
[3011.24 - 3016.44] P:1663.33 E:0.098953 |  yeah and but Belgrade with a goal for Harry Kane and then Nonny Madwake with that that pace down
[3016.44 - 3020.68] P:1598.74 E:0.090401 |  the right I mean he'd been causing trouble for Serbia across the for the certainly from that
[3020.68 - 3024.36] P:1617.98 E:0.081141 |  that half an hour point where England really seemed to kick into gear yeah I think this
[3024.36 - 3029.48] P:1820.55 E:0.097300 |  camp he's the one that's probably Sean the Sean the brightest he's took his chance a bit similar
[3029.48 - 3032.92] P:1687.93 E:0.095152 |  to obviously getting his chance as well at Arsenal on the on the right obviously because
[3033.48 - 3038.12] P:1764.07 E:0.101729 |  the sack is not available and he's he's taken his the chance with both hands he's been our
[3038.12 - 3042.92] P:1596.17 E:0.089636 |  arguably our best player for what three halves of football so far that he's got to play in but
[3042.92 - 3048.76] P:1568.59 E:0.079034 |  we spoke before the game about when do you give people opportunities and and sort of experience
[3048.76 - 3053.48] P:1469.31 E:0.099099 |  to play for your country we look at the obviously the second goal we've got Anderson who plays it
[3053.56 - 3058.92] P:1728.46 E:0.095544 |  to Rodgers who flicks it around the corner to Madwake so again you know the under 21 connection
[3058.92 - 3063.24] P:1901.00 E:0.101772 |  there you could see even the celebrations they were all thanking each other big smiles and
[3063.24 - 3068.76] P:1704.30 E:0.096330 |  everyone's happy so that's when it does work you know giving opportunities to younger players to
[3068.76 - 3072.52] P:1827.95 E:0.096159 |  see how they deal with these atmospheres and and those three in particular have done well tonight
[3073.72 - 3077.80] P:1643.40 E:0.090559 |  Leon's social media says to be fair this is the best I've seen England under Tuchel but
[3077.80 - 3080.60] P:1642.79 E:0.082843 |  it's like saying this is the best I've seen Sheffield United under Sellers
[3081.32 - 3087.16] P:1787.10 E:0.089939 |  Wow he's having a great time with it to be perfectly honest I thought you might enjoy that one that
[3087.16 - 3091.40] P:1477.63 E:0.104153 |  was all but look I'm not because we've lost every game so well no but I thought you might
[3091.40 - 3096.68] P:1706.93 E:0.101761 |  enjoy the comment rather than the season so far and but Lisa says fair play to Madwake taking
[3096.68 - 3101.64] P:1729.78 E:0.091427 |  his chances Elliott Anderson looks exceptional much improved there was the error which only stands
[3101.64 - 3105.96] P:1449.24 E:0.094895 |  out because it's probably the only error that England made in that that first half but other
[3106.04 - 3108.68] P:1411.16 E:0.105972 |  than that what have you made of this? What I like about it though is the way he reacted
[3109.48 - 3113.16] P:1682.95 E:0.090352 |  you know we all make mistakes and he's making a mistake on the biggest stage
[3113.16 - 3117.80] P:1670.02 E:0.097549 |  he's probably played in and he's not he's not obviously going to his shell he gets the ball
[3117.80 - 3123.80] P:1682.57 E:0.075658 |  again gets on it helps create some chances yeah and he's doing well in that in that first half
[3123.80 - 3128.20] P:1625.10 E:0.098439 |  and England have looked good as they they move into the second half as you said Serbia going to have
[3128.20 - 3133.40] P:1709.65 E:0.085497 |  to to go for it a bit more in the in the second half opportunities will open up for for England
[3133.40 - 3138.36] P:1540.94 E:0.092282 |  do you think we'll start to see Thomas Tuchel make changes is he still looking at that that setup?
[3139.64 - 3145.64] P:1622.93 E:0.086353 |  I think he'll I'm not the honest answer I don't know I think if they're still on top and they can
[3145.64 - 3150.52] P:1679.64 E:0.073597 |  look like they could potentially get a couple more goals I think he'll quite like the feeling of
[3150.52 - 3156.60] P:1759.73 E:0.076731 |  potentially after the game selling the dream that things are coming along nicely and you know we're
[3156.60 - 3160.28] P:1979.84 E:0.094638 |  scoring more goals and creating more where it's obviously if you start to make substitutions
[3160.28 - 3165.56] P:1873.38 E:0.083673 |  sometimes it can you know slow the pace of the game down and change things around so as much as
[3165.56 - 3169.56] P:1689.99 E:0.080072 |  he potentially would like probably to see a few more different faces I think if the game's going
[3169.56 - 3173.96] P:1833.37 E:0.079787 |  the way it is especially the second half of the first half if that chance translates into the
[3173.96 - 3178.04] P:1397.43 E:0.070914 |  first bit the second half he'll probably stay as he is and hopefully England get on top yeah and
[3178.04 - 3181.08] P:1500.45 E:0.083055 |  he'll probably tell us that he doesn't listen to the critics but that doesn't mean he doesn't want
[3181.08 - 3187.56] P:1947.43 E:0.096167 |  to answer them Phil thank you very much we'll be talking to you a bit later on so it's Serbia nil
[3187.56 - 3192.92] P:1821.84 E:0.097135 |  England too at halftime worlds have got a friendly against Canada molly Stevens is watching that one

[3205.64 - 3211.40] P:1915.25 E:0.083932 |  free kick some 30 yards out they'd hit the post and the bar before that centre half got off the ball
[3211.40 - 3217.08] P:1996.97 E:0.085461 |  he was absolutely phenomenal six yellow cards have been handed out so far including for the Canada

[3227.48 - 3232.52] P:2003.08 E:0.081701 |  Canada have just been relentless high pressing high energy football Craig Bellamy will need to

[3478.92 - 3485.32] P:1797.01 E:0.089670 |  promoted London City Lionesses they brought on Caitlin Ford, Stina Blatestinius, Frieda Manum
[3485.32 - 3493.64] P:1741.94 E:0.069247 |  and Beth Mead and they would probably get into I would say a lot of WSL teams starting 11 so that
[3493.64 - 3497.88] P:1765.93 E:0.088981 |  strength in depth is something that maybe they didn't have last season so if they were able to
[3497.88 - 3502.52] P:1704.26 E:0.073562 |  keep everyone fit that would go a long way for them fighting for the title and a lot of major
[3502.52 - 3506.84] P:1849.20 E:0.081422 |  trophies but yeah you've got to give credit to Beth Mead obviously she would have been disappointed
[3506.84 - 3512.84] P:1831.76 E:0.081982 |  not to have started the game but showing her mentality to come on and have to assist in two
[3512.84 - 3520.52] P:1705.77 E:0.082067 |  minutes her impact her professionalism and obviously her quality as well because at both of
[3520.52 - 3525.80] P:1839.21 E:0.081584 |  those goals she could have gone herself actually and had a strike maybe would maybe could have scored
[3525.80 - 3530.52] P:1760.90 E:0.078427 |  but she cut she done quite a lot of chopping and then just some lovely crosses into the ball
[3530.52 - 3536.28] P:1753.19 E:0.085674 |  especially the kind of dinked one back poster to Frieda Manum's header but yeah credit to her
[3536.28 - 3541.96] P:1828.84 E:0.084985 |  with her mentality also showcasing that she is a key player for Arsenal and like you say quite in
[3541.96 - 3546.20] P:1858.99 E:0.072655 |  those rumors that she is going to leave because she does love Arsenal. Ellen can you just take us
[3546.20 - 3552.20] P:1547.55 E:0.082271 |  back a little bit you mentioned earlier Ron about the feeling in the ground so it's 38,000 at the
[3552.20 - 3559.24] P:1403.25 E:0.073505 |  Emirates on Saturday what was the atmosphere like and how did it compare to last season for example?
[3559.24 - 3562.68] P:1719.34 E:0.090300 |  Yeah I thought the atmosphere was great I think they told everyone to get in their seats because
[3562.68 - 3567.72] P:1625.35 E:0.095425 |  they were doing a kind of farewell to to Leah Volte and then Leah Williamson walked out with the
[3567.72 - 3572.12] P:1717.56 E:0.101309 |  the European trophy, Champions League trophy and that really got the place kind of rocking.
[3572.92 - 3579.40] P:1619.29 E:0.095363 |  Yeah it was an amazing atmosphere even when London City Lionesses went one nil up you could still
[3579.40 - 3584.04] P:1672.06 E:0.084301 |  feel the crowd they were still singing they were still willing the team on and then it
[3584.04 - 3589.40] P:1595.58 E:0.081189 |  absolutely erupted obviously when Olivia Smith scored and also I'd like to give credit as well
[3589.40 - 3595.24] P:1685.53 E:0.076161 |  to Arsenal that they've sold 17,000 season tickets which is a phenomenal amount of tickets to be sold
[3595.24 - 3599.72] P:1523.63 E:0.091306 |  for them to have every home game at the Emirates so that blueprint of what they're doing for their
[3599.72 - 3604.76] P:1644.85 E:0.080202 |  fan base is quite extraordinary and hopefully more teams are able to kind of look at that and think
[3604.76 - 3610.60] P:1632.37 E:0.080613 |  how can we grow our fan base get bums on seat get people supporting our club not just in the WSL
[3610.60 - 3614.92] P:1261.68 E:0.064310 |  but the whole football pyramid because that's important we need the teams to be supported.
[3614.92 - 3619.16] P:1541.67 E:0.078037 |  That's some going Tom isn't it to shift 17,000 season tickets.
[3619.16 - 3623.80] P:1806.13 E:0.101092 |  Yeah that number alone is it's 10 times the figure that we're at the game that you and I saw on Sunday
[3623.80 - 3628.12] P:1871.50 E:0.079200 |  between Tottenham and West Ham and you know the attendance on Saturday was 20 times that of some
[3628.12 - 3633.40] P:1883.48 E:0.078921 |  of the other WSL games they're kind of operating in a different like stratosphere to the other WSL
[3633.40 - 3639.64] P:1826.12 E:0.058720 |  clubs with the numbers that they're attracting. There's a big gulf there not just in terms of the
[3639.64 - 3643.96] P:1790.92 E:0.084791 |  audience but in terms of the matchday revenues that that is going to generate so if other teams
[3643.96 - 3647.88] P:1829.96 E:0.079371 |  aren't careful then Arsenal are just going to carry on getting further and further ahead because
[3647.88 - 3652.84] P:1870.74 E:0.069400 |  the more matchday revenue they get the more times they'll be able to spend a million pounds on a
[3652.84 - 3658.12] P:1856.63 E:0.073880 |  superstar like Olivia Smith so it's something that I think all the other clubs are going to be
[3658.12 - 3663.48] P:1644.02 E:0.068141 |  looking at and from all we hear at Arsenal the crowd we saw on Saturday is probably looking
[3663.48 - 3667.56] P:1951.64 E:0.066267 |  like it's going to be about the average for the season they're sort of expecting that
[3667.56 - 3673.00] P:1670.22 E:0.086488 |  pretty much give or take that every week now for the campaign and that's going to be really formidable
[3673.00 - 3678.28] P:1667.01 E:0.073445 |  as a just adding the footballing context as you know as a home support and what they that could
[3678.28 - 3683.00] P:1581.15 E:0.080728 |  do for their home record over the course of a season that that's something that will really be
[3683.00 - 3687.00] P:1770.04 E:0.084032 |  dangerous for the visiting sides to contend with over the course of the campaign as it starts to
[3687.00 - 3690.68] P:1679.07 E:0.084973 |  feel more and more like home for the women's players as well because I think if we go back
[3690.68 - 3695.32] P:1899.88 E:0.082336 |  maybe three years it was unfamiliar still for some of the Arsenal women's players and now it will
[3695.32 - 3700.68] P:1559.19 E:0.084675 |  start to have those home comforts. On Friday night Tom and I were down at Stanford Bridge to see
[3700.68 - 3704.84] P:1438.60 E:0.095493 |  Chelsea Man City and a good atmosphere there probably not the same numbers Tom but a good
[3704.84 - 3711.40] P:1731.42 E:0.081346 |  atmosphere at Stanford Bridge a really impressive and professional performance from Chelsea as they
[3711.40 - 3715.96] P:1807.31 E:0.077828 |  ran out two-one winners over City. Yeah it was one of those games we've seen so many of from
[3715.96 - 3721.00] P:1698.04 E:0.080698 |  Chelsea where I don't think they ever showed their absolute best football I don't think they ever
[3721.00 - 3725.80] P:1863.99 E:0.083048 |  really played more than maybe seven or eight out of ten but they've still managed to win a really
[3725.80 - 3730.76] P:1814.00 E:0.072202 |  important game being clinical in the key moments defending the box and then you needed to take
[3730.76 - 3735.00] P:2048.80 E:0.082459 |  in their chance I think they had three shots on target and scored twice which is very Chelsea in
[3735.00 - 3742.60] P:1956.18 E:0.058172 |  terms of the efficiency. That was just a snippet of Women's Football Weekly. Ben Haynes, Ellen White
[3742.60 - 3749.24] P:1895.34 E:0.082633 |  and Tom Gary were on there you can listen to it on BBC Sounds right now. Our focus this evening is
[3749.24 - 3753.32] P:1681.11 E:0.082617 |  on the England men's qualification campaign for the World Cup next summer they're currently two
[3753.32 - 3759.00] P:1905.46 E:0.087437 |  nil up against Serbia in the other group in group K which is England's group Albania are beating
[3759.00 - 3766.76] P:2040.69 E:0.076837 |  Latvia one nil at half time so if it stays like this England will be seven points clear of Albania
[3766.76 - 3772.52] P:1898.50 E:0.085520 |  eight ahead of Serbia who have a game in hand and if England do go on to win this game in
[3772.52 - 3778.68] P:2025.05 E:0.072891 |  Belgrade this evening they'd only need five more points from the last three matches to secure a
[3778.68 - 3786.44] P:1979.03 E:0.053758 |  place in the World Cup next summer and yet Phil people are still not happy. Well that's what I
[3786.60 - 3790.68] P:1588.47 E:0.109095 |  can't maybe want to go out there as a nation and go and dominate every game and win so hopefully
[3790.68 - 3795.72] P:1992.12 E:0.083044 |  there's a big second half coming and there'll be a few more smiley faces tonight and tomorrow morning.
[3796.84 - 3802.20] P:1809.30 E:0.096385 |  So goals so far for Harry Kane and Noni Madweke for England's second half coming up from Belgrade
[3802.20 - 3807.96] P:1847.94 E:0.081142 |  with Paul Robinson, Enny and Dennis and first of all John Murray. Thank you very much Kelly.
[3808.60 - 3813.40] P:1993.43 E:0.089527 |  Yes we're still waiting for the teams to emerge from that famous tunnel here many of the England
[3813.40 - 3820.12] P:1981.75 E:0.086613 |  substitutes are out Paul Robinson sitting next to me and what a half that was for England as Ian
[3820.12 - 3826.44] P:2045.57 E:0.085270 |  rightly said the best half that Thomas Tuchela has had as the England manager so far in his sixth match.
[3826.44 - 3830.68] P:1945.67 E:0.076643 |  Far none they were excellent I think they're everything that we've wanted to see from England
[3830.68 - 3835.56] P:1958.99 E:0.090983 |  yes they've been underwhelming in previous games but I think he's he spoke quite openly about this
[3835.56 - 3839.32] P:1984.97 E:0.082124 |  game been a tough test he thought that it'd be a better game for them because Serbia would actually
[3839.32 - 3843.72] P:1922.50 E:0.086496 |  come out and play and try and expose England but actually England have done really well to move
[3843.72 - 3848.28] P:1999.89 E:0.086129 |  the ball quickly and Serbia have sat in a low block at times but the link-up play that England
[3848.28 - 3852.60] P:2028.13 E:0.088921 |  have showed the intensity to the thing that's impressed me they've pressed really high up the
[3852.60 - 3857.56] P:2047.34 E:0.085268 |  pitch the understanding between Rhys James and Madweke down the right hand side most of England's
[3857.56 - 3861.88] P:1994.27 E:0.088204 |  threat has come down that right hand side and everything that Thomas Tuchela spoke about
[3861.88 - 3868.28] P:1994.48 E:0.080235 |  before this game we are seeing. Teams are out there it looks as though Draghann Stojkovic is going to
[3868.28 - 3875.08] P:1943.92 E:0.079027 |  make a couple of changes at halftime I'm not surprised at that they've been a long way second
[3875.08 - 3882.68] P:1865.39 E:0.086415 |  best in this match and and Slobodan our our colleague from the BBC Serbian service was telling us that
[3882.68 - 3889.72] P:1923.69 E:0.091030 |  many of the supporters were chanting Pixie out at halftime so he might be one of the great heroes
[3890.36 - 3896.36] P:1979.40 E:0.090037 |  of Serbian football but there seems to be a a mood against him here inside the stadium
[3897.08 - 3903.40] P:1958.19 E:0.093841 |  so we're going to see Philip Kostic who is left wing can play it wing back place for Yaventus
[3904.28 - 3912.68] P:1967.96 E:0.085939 |  and also Lukac Jović coming on the number eight who was one of the brightest young stars if you
[3912.68 - 3919.16] P:1880.86 E:0.093142 |  remember when he came through at Red Star Belgrade he made his debut he was the youngest player at
[3919.16 - 3925.96] P:1933.35 E:0.090652 |  one stage ended up getting a move to to Real Madrid who paid 60 million euros for him but his
[3925.96 - 3933.72] P:1888.49 E:0.071369 |  career has kind of tailed off since then and he's now actually he's just moved Lukac Jović to A.E.K. Athens
[3933.72 - 3946.44] P:1887.10 E:0.058178 |  so Kostic and Jović are on for Nedelkovic and Biaman Cevic so the two wing backs actually
[3946.44 - 3952.92] P:1798.65 E:0.088220 |  have been taken off second half begins Serbian nil England two and Serbia win an early free kick
[3952.92 - 3957.32] P:1612.23 E:0.083746 |  halfway inside the England half Morgan Rodgers who I thought was very good in the first half
[3957.32 - 3962.28] P:1699.67 E:0.085778 |  one of the four changes that Thomas Tucho made set up the Madwaker goal brilliantly but they've
[3962.28 - 3966.52] P:1791.56 E:0.083836 |  won themselves a set PC airport yeah surprise that Kostic and Jović didn't actually start the game
[3967.08 - 3971.16] P:1774.64 E:0.095063 |  they started their previous game against Latvia on Saturday in the 1-0 win and those two were
[3971.16 - 3975.88] P:1812.78 E:0.084143 |  surprise emissions from the from the start in 11 I think Jović will go and play up alongside
[3975.88 - 3979.80] P:1797.51 E:0.076989 |  Blavić trying to have more of an attacking threat and Kostic will play in the wing back position
[3980.76 - 3987.96] P:1749.26 E:0.070489 |  so this free kick and it will be taken by Philip Kostic the Juventus man might remember he was
[3987.96 - 3993.24] P:1672.37 E:0.088034 |  injured against England at the Euros and had to go off with a knee injury he curls this ball in
[3993.24 - 4000.76] P:1718.25 E:0.084788 |  and it's headed away for England and then played away to the halfway line and Anderson chasing it
[4000.76 - 4007.64] P:1862.90 E:0.094999 |  and it was a sort of 50-50 challenge he was caught by his club mate Milenkovic actually
[4008.76 - 4015.24] P:1924.86 E:0.093725 |  the Serbian captain is Nottingham Forrest team made has put a challenge in on
[4015.24 - 4019.96] P:1764.24 E:0.091856 |  Elliot Anderson as he was breaking away that's classic international football isn't it no love
[4019.96 - 4024.44] P:1948.24 E:0.078137 |  lost between the club mates no coming together in a real good 50-50 challenge he was there first
[4024.44 - 4030.68] P:1772.97 E:0.057307 |  Milenkovic the Anderson just went over the challenge but as you can see and here the support
[4030.84 - 4034.36] P:1941.68 E:0.085116 |  inside this stadium weren't too happy that the referee stopped the game they felt that the game
[4034.36 - 4040.12] P:1777.34 E:0.060936 |  should have been allowed to carry it on it wasn't a head injury no and the referee stopped play
[4040.12 - 4050.20] P:1723.10 E:0.071732 |  and he has restarted play with a drop ball Clementurpa so Serbia nil England two so the changes
[4050.20 - 4056.68] P:1616.49 E:0.081445 |  being made by Dragan Stojkovic means that the Serbia team and they've got the ball at the back
[4056.68 - 4063.56] P:1703.62 E:0.093273 |  just at the moment playing it long to the halfway line and now Mark Gaye is having that
[4063.56 - 4068.84] P:1727.13 E:0.088432 |  it Esri Konza has to stand up strongly there under the challenge and he's able to come out with the
[4068.84 - 4075.00] P:1663.88 E:0.090707 |  ball and give it to Elliot Anderson so Petrovic is the goalkeeper has been beaten twice the the
[4075.00 - 4082.84] P:1715.84 E:0.085741 |  Bournemouth man and the second of them by his former Chelsea teammate Noni Maduake as Serbia
[4083.80 - 4088.28] P:1706.14 E:0.088899 |  looking to improve their efforts in the second half this is better from them Illich though
[4088.28 - 4092.92] P:1701.84 E:0.090769 |  he's challenged by Livremento good challenge that leaves Illich on the ground and England looked
[4092.92 - 4097.64] P:1693.59 E:0.094136 |  at to play it out from the back although they've lost possession in the left full back position
[4097.64 - 4102.12] P:1644.40 E:0.082695 |  ball comes into the middle but Mark Gaye is there to stretch forward and head it Livremento takes it
[4102.12 - 4108.68] P:1571.66 E:0.088121 |  down he passes it forward to to Harry Kane who drives a long pass which is asking a lot of Noni
[4108.68 - 4113.56] P:1713.70 E:0.097770 |  Maduake he's going to do well to reach there he does reach it actually Defender goes there with him
[4113.56 - 4123.00] P:1811.91 E:0.084047 |  and and the two of them Pavlovic in the end is able to get to the ball out physical Maduake and
[4123.00 - 4128.44] P:1592.65 E:0.087622 |  wins a throw in for Serbia halfway inside his own half yes so the Serbia team Petrovic and
[4128.44 - 4134.12] P:1675.69 E:0.087464 |  goal Irakovic Milankovic and Pavlovic are the three central defenders Zivkovic now is the
[4134.12 - 4140.12] P:1658.83 E:0.094306 |  as the right wing back as England attack with Maduake Rogers ball across Rice in the D controls
[4140.12 - 4145.96] P:1689.14 E:0.076597 |  and shoots wide a sort of bubbling shot a bouncing shot that he pulled wide of the left post as he
[4145.96 - 4150.04] P:1596.76 E:0.089463 |  looked at it yeah good opportunity for Declan Rice there early in this second half again it's
[4150.04 - 4155.00] P:1751.97 E:0.089237 |  England's threat down this right hand side Maduake works the ball into Rogers who in turn finds
[4155.00 - 4158.20] P:1864.84 E:0.083829 |  Declan Rice he's got all the time in the world on the edge of the box he's getting able to get the
[4158.20 - 4165.16] P:1729.73 E:0.062704 |  ball out of his feet and he just drags the shot while he's disappointed so Serbia with the the
[4165.16 - 4172.68] P:1778.77 E:0.072919 |  goal kick as I say Zivkovic now the the right wing back Ilic Lukicjofullin and Maximovic in the
[4172.68 - 4180.52] P:1745.40 E:0.071489 |  central area substitute Kostic on the left and then Jovic and Vladovic Alexander Mitrovic remains
[4180.52 - 4184.12] P:1651.40 E:0.085545 |  on the bench and the England team if you weren't listening earlier the England team that Thomas
[4184.12 - 4191.48] P:1745.60 E:0.076271 |  Tukul picked tonight four changes from Saturday so Pickford in goal James Konza gay and Livremento
[4191.48 - 4197.00] P:1631.32 E:0.076869 |  then Elliot Anderson with Morgan Rogers and Declan Rice in the midfield and Maduake on the right
[4197.00 - 4204.60] P:1707.56 E:0.073659 |  Gordon on the left and Harry Kane up front who scored his 74th goal for England on his 109th
[4204.60 - 4212.60] P:1708.10 E:0.084173 |  appearance so Harry Kane now in fifth place on his own on the list of England appearances
[4213.56 - 4218.68] P:1729.38 E:0.088143 |  playing the ball out from the edge of their own penalty area Reese James going back to
[4218.68 - 4225.16] P:1783.27 E:0.081967 |  to goalkeeper Pickford who goes long Erling Harlanders just scored his fourth goal of the night so
[4225.16 - 4234.44] P:1653.26 E:0.069009 |  Norway 6-0 up on Moldova after that dramatic win for Italy last night against Israel but
[4234.44 - 4238.84] P:1579.00 E:0.083631 |  Norway have won all of their matches so far in that group and the final match in that section
[4238.84 - 4248.60] P:1774.41 E:0.061195 |  is Italy against Norway England with this score line by heading for five wins out of five at the top
[4248.60 - 4256.52] P:1663.79 E:0.070159 |  of group K and Maduake with the ball on the right hand side just a little past to Reese James now
[4256.52 - 4261.16] P:1641.57 E:0.100283 |  Elliot Anderson who's been very tidy really I know he's spoken about the mistake that he made in
[4261.16 - 4266.68] P:1565.97 E:0.086680 |  the first half but other than that out to the left hand side it goes with Declan Rice Rice back in
[4266.68 - 4273.88] P:1613.82 E:0.083293 |  field towards Elliot Anderson square from him to James who's 30 yards out Serbia all in blue
[4274.52 - 4280.28] P:1597.20 E:0.087596 |  10 men behind the ball as Maduake now attacks again against Costage pulls it back to the edge of
[4280.28 - 4285.40] P:1623.56 E:0.084618 |  the area to James he tees up Rice with the shot that's blocked inside the penalty area by Milankovic
[4285.40 - 4289.80] P:1623.48 E:0.094034 |  and Serbia try to bring it away but England are all over them Paul he's done so well none he might
[4289.80 - 4293.32] P:1738.96 E:0.084991 |  have worked you down this right hand side again this is where the threat comes from pulls the ball
[4293.32 - 4297.56] P:1836.00 E:0.085412 |  back to Reese James and he lays it across the edge of the 18-yard box for Declan Rice to strike
[4297.56 - 4301.56] P:1782.74 E:0.089962 |  first time and we know what a good right foot Declan Rice has got that's the last two chances that
[4301.56 - 4308.28] P:1664.08 E:0.077724 |  he hasn't got right and now Declan Rice wins a free kick for England left of centre so another set
[4308.28 - 4314.76] P:1541.17 E:0.087532 |  piece for England incidentally France have equalised now against Iceland and it was Kilian Mbappe
[4314.76 - 4319.48] P:1460.92 E:0.083984 |  who made it 1-1 in the in that match that's being played in the park to France actually this evening
[4319.48 - 4324.60] P:1476.47 E:0.091019 |  Kilian Mbappe was one of the gold scorers by the way when Thomas Tuchel's PSG won 4-1 here in that
[4324.60 - 4330.28] P:1624.46 E:0.082292 |  match we were talking about in the first half 2-0 to England free kick taken short and then it's
[4330.28 - 4335.32] P:1684.46 E:0.095174 |  driven in from the left hand side Maduake with a judge came and then it's scored on the dead
[4335.32 - 4342.60] P:1824.12 E:0.092716 |  ball line almost and it's Henry Konza who's there to score his first goal for England virtually
[4342.60 - 4349.00] P:1802.24 E:0.087900 |  standing next to the post it fell to him and he swept it in and turned away and went off to
[4349.00 - 4354.36] P:1825.29 E:0.090687 |  celebrate his first goal for England the Aston Villa central defender and surely that's it now
[4354.36 - 4359.64] P:1779.30 E:0.091781 |  here tonight three goals for England and three points in Belgrade Serbia near England three
[4359.64 - 4364.04] P:1823.97 E:0.089308 |  the England fans away to our right are absolutely delighted they've picked up where they left
[4364.04 - 4368.92] P:1783.72 E:0.094341 |  off in the first half England started on the front front at a really good two or three passages of
[4368.92 - 4374.20] P:1778.48 E:0.093210 |  play this time it's a quick short free kick played into Anthony Gordon 25 yards from goal it's a
[4374.20 - 4378.84] P:1797.86 E:0.086694 |  difficult one for Petrovic to deal with it bounces just in front of the Serbian goalkeeper
[4378.92 - 4383.00] P:1921.03 E:0.093285 |  gets two hands on it but all he can do is push it into a crowd of England players
[4383.00 - 4387.64] P:1883.63 E:0.090276 |  gay as he gets there first deflects across the box you think Harry Kane's going to put it in
[4387.64 - 4393.08] P:1978.07 E:0.088796 |  but there's Esri Konza with his left foot just surely giving them all three points and to top off
[4393.08 - 4399.08] P:1647.03 E:0.080736 |  what's already been a wonderful performance so Esri Konza as it's announced on the loud
[4399.08 - 4403.16] P:1643.83 E:0.094419 |  speaker and you might have heard there as well I don't think you had to be an expert in Serbo
[4403.16 - 4410.44] P:1637.92 E:0.085495 |  Croat to work out the that was the loudest chorus of pixie out that we've that we've heard so far
[4411.00 - 4417.00] P:1509.02 E:0.079826 |  so in fact looking down now there is a bit of movement there I think one or two are beginning
[4417.00 - 4423.96] P:1550.88 E:0.076698 |  to head towards the the exits and there is a possibility that that goal might be ruled out
[4423.96 - 4430.92] P:1722.21 E:0.075676 |  there is a suggestion that that there could be an offside yeah the AR taking a check now
[4431.64 - 4439.00] P:1739.57 E:0.091165 |  much has restarted his over and the goal stands confirmed Serbian ill England three
[4439.00 - 4448.44] P:1758.27 E:0.068734 |  and Esri Konza scoring the the third goal Esri Konza winning his 14th cap here in Belgrade tonight
[4448.44 - 4455.16] P:1756.48 E:0.088198 |  Harry Kane drags the ball back that actually is dispossessed and now Lukaj Jowicz will carry the
[4455.16 - 4460.76] P:1768.25 E:0.081336 |  ball long and forward but incomes the challenge from James it's a foul and it's a free kick
[4460.76 - 4464.60] P:1714.58 E:0.087452 |  to Serbia it's got another update from Swansea and Molly Stevens
[4465.32 - 4469.96] P:1856.72 E:0.096119 |  Wales nil Canada won Wales have had the best chance of this second half so far powerful
[4469.96 - 4474.92] P:1908.05 E:0.092787 |  header from captain Ben Davis into Harry Wilson on his left who looked to score on the volley but
[4474.92 - 4481.24] P:1836.96 E:0.081778 |  Canada's defenders did very well to clear it it remains Wales nil Canada won Bosnia and Hurtigovina
[4481.24 - 4488.36] P:1649.70 E:0.079526 |  nil Austria one in group H and they are the top two in that group so Austria Ralf Ragnick's Austria
[4488.36 - 4494.12] P:1698.07 E:0.078661 |  winning free kick then Kostić plays it into the England penalty area it took a flick off
[4495.08 - 4500.04] P:1655.69 E:0.088421 |  an England head and that is being very strongly disputed it's been given as a corner by Clement
[4500.04 - 4503.56] P:1737.00 E:0.075428 |  Turpan but it's a corner to Serbia yeah the England players are absolutely adamant that it
[4503.56 - 4507.64] P:1800.24 E:0.079779 |  wasn't a corner but they're gonna have to defend as you can hear now the noise in the stadium has
[4507.72 - 4511.32] P:1723.41 E:0.077044 |  been completely nullified I mean it was an electric atmosphere before the game
[4511.32 - 4514.92] P:1836.58 E:0.081775 |  as you can see as well there's a few that are wandering towards the exits already
[4514.92 - 4520.92] P:1668.22 E:0.077189 |  they're certainly not happy at the moment corner to Serbia 3-0 down deep one right across the
[4520.92 - 4526.28] P:1674.10 E:0.082299 |  penalty area which is actually headed back by Morgan Rogers to Jordan Pickford I'm not sure
[4526.28 - 4530.36] P:1585.50 E:0.084710 |  whether he entirely meant that no I don't think he did I think he was a very brave header back
[4530.36 - 4534.44] P:1752.89 E:0.083128 |  to his goalkeeper in that situation if he did we'll give him the benefit of the doubt good piece
[4534.44 - 4541.72] P:1619.85 E:0.080221 |  of defended that's Paul Robinson England goalkeeper another old Stager has scored for Bosnia
[4541.72 - 4547.64] P:1654.44 E:0.080677 |  and Herzegovina Edin Jekyll has equalised so Austria went 1-0 up Bosnia Herzegovina
[4547.64 - 4555.40] P:1577.25 E:0.076874 |  have promptly equalised and earlier in this group by the way Albania were winning 1-0 against Latvia
[4555.40 - 4559.64] P:1640.31 E:0.095046 |  as far as I'm aware that's still the score Harry Kane in a deep line position curls the ball
[4559.64 - 4564.52] P:1682.55 E:0.076883 |  into the box Anthony Gordon takes it down it was Gordon's shot that actually led eventually to
[4564.52 - 4569.72] P:1699.01 E:0.079429 |  the Konza goal to make it 3-0 the ball as he's challenged bounces out of play and that is given
[4569.72 - 4575.00] P:1674.55 E:0.100035 |  as a Serbia throw 10 minutes played in the second half we will be on air by the way to
[4575.72 - 4582.28] P:1643.30 E:0.083808 |  hear the reaction from Thomas Tuchel and whoever else we are presented with so you will hear that
[4582.28 - 4589.32] P:1553.54 E:0.086469 |  on five live tonight we've got to go a long way away behind the stadium to my left I've got a
[4589.32 - 4595.24] P:1495.85 E:0.085439 |  actually walked down the street about 200 yards and then turn right into the training ground and
[4595.24 - 4600.76] P:1455.58 E:0.091873 |  they're eventually going to bring them to us in what must be the most remote interview position
[4600.76 - 4604.60] P:1684.19 E:0.089391 |  that I think I've ever been to have you heard what they're doing with Thomas Tuchel after you've
[4604.60 - 4608.68] P:1501.96 E:0.094252 |  interviewed him to bring him to the press conference I have they're going to bring him in a car
[4609.40 - 4615.48] P:1650.76 E:0.081982 |  from there to actually do his press conference we've got to stop it now by the way the Serbian
[4615.48 - 4623.72] P:1583.05 E:0.076250 |  player who challenged Anthony Gordon has has stayed down so he's going to need a little bit of
[4623.72 - 4628.84] P:1642.40 E:0.079794 |  treatment he did actually used to have a smart car you know when he was Chelsea manager he used to
[4628.84 - 4634.20] P:1601.15 E:0.088531 |  used to total into Chelsea's training ground in a smart car so he might might be back in the smart
[4634.20 - 4641.32] P:1663.23 E:0.079602 |  car tonight also outside the ground I saw some of the most fearsome police stroke security stroke
[4641.40 - 4647.80] P:1592.26 E:0.081599 |  army personnel I think I've ever seen at a football ground I mean full riot gear armor
[4648.60 - 4652.92] P:1610.59 E:0.092541 |  and you actually you've just picked them out in the some of them in the stands there in the empty
[4652.92 - 4659.64] P:1557.09 E:0.082792 |  seats the the 8100 seats that are empty that because of the reduced capacity here tonight
[4660.20 - 4666.12] P:1631.01 E:0.073178 |  this is a this is a lengthy stoppage actually it's it's Zivkovich just catches a stray arm from
[4666.12 - 4671.00] P:1749.32 E:0.075793 |  Anthony Gordon both players chasing for the ball in the corner I think there's there's no intent there
[4671.08 - 4675.32] P:1757.53 E:0.082721 |  from Anthony Gordon at all but what it does do it allows Thomas Tuchel to get his players over to
[4675.32 - 4680.36] P:1751.86 E:0.084638 |  the touch line like we see quite often the managers use these times for almost like a basketball
[4680.36 - 4685.24] P:1791.36 E:0.080045 |  timeout all the players are stood down beneath us Thomas Tuchel talking to them individually
[4685.24 - 4688.92] P:1792.55 E:0.078017 |  and taking opportunity to get some drinks on board and getting some more messages
[4688.92 - 4693.32] P:1673.85 E:0.087132 |  onto his team he's stood talking to Livremento quite intently yep Livremento the left back
[4694.44 - 4699.56] P:1698.14 E:0.086719 |  so the goal scorer as England scored twice in two minutes in that period Harry Kane and then
[4699.56 - 4707.64] P:1680.23 E:0.073453 |  Nonny Madweykay Harry Kane incidentally has now scored in 16 different countries for England
[4707.64 - 4714.68] P:1600.45 E:0.081057 |  which equals Wayne Rooney's record 16 different countries he's now got Serbia on the list and
[4714.68 - 4720.28] P:1677.75 E:0.080749 |  and with Declan Rice sending in the corner for Harry Kane's goal which was I mean it was as
[4720.28 - 4725.24] P:1640.78 E:0.086436 |  straightforward as could be I'm not sure Harry Kane will he will rarely have had as much space
[4725.72 - 4729.88] P:1636.02 E:0.084739 |  from a from a corner head in as he did for that goal incredible how he wasn't marked but I mean
[4729.88 - 4733.72] P:1760.66 E:0.093040 |  it was a really good delivery from Declan Rice but Kane still had a lot to do didn't he when the
[4733.72 - 4738.76] P:1745.72 E:0.082253 |  ball got to him he's 12 yards out he's kind of had to stoop and direct the header really good powerful
[4738.76 - 4745.96] P:1582.30 E:0.073821 |  low header and Declan Rice that's now three goals and five assists in his last 13 England appearances
[4745.96 - 4752.04] P:1683.50 E:0.090457 |  Zivkovich has been has received his treatment and he's able to come back onto the field Serbia
[4752.12 - 4755.80] P:1672.56 E:0.090724 |  are breaking forward there's a collision two players clashing off the ball on the edge of the
[4755.80 - 4764.04] P:1707.04 E:0.076185 |  box there's this move breaks down down the left hand side and and Harry Kane is able to turn
[4764.04 - 4770.84] P:1665.87 E:0.079832 |  and chip it forward for Morgan Rogers to chase after but Malinkovic gets there first goalkeeper
[4770.84 - 4778.52] P:1642.83 E:0.078936 |  Petrovic plays it out from the back Portugal who were one nil down are now winning two one in
[4778.52 - 4784.76] P:1581.58 E:0.083314 |  Budapest against Hungary and Cristiano Ronaldo has scored yet another goal wouldn't we say the other
[4784.76 - 4791.16] P:1533.03 E:0.081272 |  day 140 international goals I think that I think that's now 141 that he's scored Harry Kane's got
[4791.16 - 4797.40] P:1664.40 E:0.085028 |  a little way to go to catch up with him but Kane has has now scored five goals under Thomas Tucho
[4798.04 - 4807.08] P:1628.85 E:0.070664 |  and and four goals in this group so England with the ball at the back
[4809.16 - 4814.36] P:1469.98 E:0.103253 |  long pass from Pigford as Serbia are able to take up possession inside their own half
[4814.36 - 4821.00] P:1507.04 E:0.102695 |  lots of England substitutes milling around down there Paul who in these circumstances three nil
[4821.00 - 4826.60] P:1571.70 E:0.088259 |  and suddenly the Serbian fans come to life in the stadium looking over the top of our balcony here
[4826.60 - 4832.36] P:1528.53 E:0.096585 |  everyone bouncing up and down so so so someone's managed to get them going
[4833.88 - 4840.04] P:1542.13 E:0.093403 |  it is Lukic of Fulham who plays the ball through the middle to Vladovic that's cleared away for
[4840.04 - 4844.84] P:1675.33 E:0.076032 |  England actually the offside flag is up and three kick to England yeah Thomas Tucho has got his
[4844.84 - 4849.88] P:1923.24 E:0.097531 |  substitutes out warming up we've seen two changes already from the Serbian manager just about to
[4849.88 - 4854.92] P:1913.68 E:0.087364 |  make his third substitution as you say you look at the quality that England have that Thomas Tucho's
[4855.00 - 4860.28] P:1858.17 E:0.092983 |  disposal on the bench the likes of Eze Raster as we know started the last game Morgan Gibbs White
[4860.28 - 4864.12] P:1839.99 E:0.093418 |  will think he was unlucky not to start the game tonight by saying that Morgan Rogers has taken
[4864.12 - 4869.00] P:1868.56 E:0.084086 |  his opportunity this far maybe Oli Watkins, Jared Bowen he won't be comfortable at three nil Thomas
[4869.00 - 4873.96] P:1919.05 E:0.081219 |  Tucho before we see a raft of changes I think he'd want another one ideally but I do suspect
[4873.96 - 4880.52] P:1775.64 E:0.072770 |  just after the hour mark we may see a couple. Dragon Stokovic has taken off Ivan Illich from the midfield
[4881.00 - 4892.12] P:1632.90 E:0.081534 |  and he has brought on Lazare Samarjic of Atalanta for his 22nd cap the number 20 Serbian nil England 3
[4892.84 - 4898.12] P:1624.38 E:0.098331 |  still waiting for that first change from Thomas Tucho who's in the in the same outfit that he
[4898.12 - 4907.48] P:1683.97 E:0.072675 |  was wearing at Velopark on the touchline on Saturday night at all black and he is just sending one
[4907.48 - 4913.80] P:1637.07 E:0.077743 |  or two signals out there as England are defending in the right back position with with Mark Gaye
[4913.80 - 4922.44] P:1669.04 E:0.080156 |  use holding off Vlahovic and then Elliot Anderson calmly plays it across his six-yard box Pickford
[4922.44 - 4929.40] P:1627.33 E:0.080377 |  plays it out to Harry Kane who goes for one of those early Harry Kane passes that Declan Rice
[4929.40 - 4935.40] P:1568.71 E:0.082781 |  is able to seed the ball back into the heart of the England half to Elliot Anderson just under
[4935.40 - 4942.36] P:1654.24 E:0.075366 |  half an hour to play Serbian nil England 3 and if you don't hear the reaction tonight then on your
[4942.36 - 4949.48] P:1606.74 E:0.081726 |  BBC sounds app search football daily in the morning and you'll hear us wrap everything up from here
[4949.48 - 4957.96] P:1535.92 E:0.087113 |  still Wales nil Canada one in the friendly in Swansea as James infield to Morgan Rodgers lovely
[4957.96 - 4963.48] P:1474.00 E:0.091523 |  angled ball for Kane inside the penalty area but he can't get round Milenkovic who does well
[4963.48 - 4967.56] P:1496.25 E:0.094596 |  actually defends it well gives it to Pavlovic still inside their own penalty area Milenkovic
[4967.56 - 4972.28] P:1846.82 E:0.089463 |  his clearance is charged down Rice on the edge of the box Gordon back to Rice left foot shot
[4972.28 - 4977.24] P:1707.02 E:0.078516 |  bounces straight at goalkeeper Petrovic who can scoop it up into his chest finding some space
[4977.24 - 4981.48] P:1682.38 E:0.093019 |  Declan Rice isn't he on the edge of the box finding a lot of space there Declan Rice
[4981.48 - 4985.72] P:1778.87 E:0.092424 |  ballwork back to him from Anthony Gordon this time it was on his left foot didn't really make any
[4985.72 - 4992.36] P:1817.57 E:0.086447 |  good type of contact with it harmlessly into the arms of Petrovic we're just seeing down to our left
[4992.36 - 5000.12] P:1727.35 E:0.093917 |  in the in the front rows of the stands there there's a disturbance there and and quite a number of
[5000.76 - 5007.48] P:1696.28 E:0.090218 |  men in black shirts actually are in that section and and there's also some trouble
[5007.48 - 5013.16] P:1563.85 E:0.095036 |  on the far side of the ground as well as a section on the far side where an area of seats has been
[5013.16 - 5021.32] P:1646.11 E:0.078817 |  emptied and and that also is an area where there are a lot of men in black shirts and and it it
[5021.40 - 5028.20] P:1712.28 E:0.081250 |  seems to have calmed down but I don't know whether there was a a point you know it's almost as if
[5028.20 - 5032.12] P:1567.93 E:0.090660 |  there was an agreed point where suddenly that trouble breaks out on both sides of the ground
[5032.12 - 5036.28] P:1789.42 E:0.089259 |  there's two or three pockets in the stadium where it's still clearly there's a lot of unrest
[5036.28 - 5039.80] P:1869.64 E:0.098672 |  those heavily armed police officers that you spoke about earlier they've all just made the way into
[5039.80 - 5044.76] P:1646.07 E:0.097872 |  the stadium you can see to the to our left they're coming all down the stairs here they come to the
[5044.76 - 5048.68] P:1742.57 E:0.102668 |  areas but there is certainly pockets of unrest around the stadium in certain areas it's not
[5048.76 - 5057.80] P:1629.63 E:0.079973 |  looking pretty no it's not and and you can hear the chanting and there must be 20 or 30 of those
[5058.92 - 5064.84] P:1554.07 E:0.087213 |  I think they are police they're very darkly dressed and they've got crash helmets on and visors
[5064.84 - 5069.32] P:1711.89 E:0.085178 |  there's a lot of families below us leaving taking the option to go yeah because that trouble did
[5069.32 - 5074.44] P:1678.56 E:0.087428 |  overspill and it kind of ran over like what 10 or 15 rows yeah we're sitting up high here so we're
[5074.44 - 5080.04] P:1440.21 E:0.087295 |  looking down on the you know it's a massive bold this stadium and as Paul Robinson says you know I
[5080.04 - 5086.28] P:1587.88 E:0.089653 |  can see now there are people streaming towards the exits and as you correctly spotted you know they do
[5086.28 - 5091.00] P:1593.44 E:0.088434 |  look like families have decided right if this is just going to be the the mood if this is going to
[5091.00 - 5096.04] P:1539.88 E:0.077071 |  be the 10 out the feeling this evening three nil down we're going to head off home there has been a
[5096.04 - 5100.36] P:1660.46 E:0.089556 |  real mood change hasn't I mean the the game at the moment it's a possession game been played in the
[5100.36 - 5104.76] P:1713.68 E:0.088565 |  middle of the park everyone in the stadium seems to be watching around to see what's going on but
[5104.76 - 5109.24] P:1744.57 E:0.090142 |  certainly the section below us is empty and very very quickly as is the far side of the stadium
[5109.24 - 5113.16] P:1553.09 E:0.085329 |  yeah and and actually while this is happening the match seems it seems to have affected the
[5113.16 - 5117.16] P:1547.04 E:0.091311 |  match and that it's now very much being played this little period here in between the penalty
[5117.16 - 5122.20] P:1686.97 E:0.090318 |  areas although here's Pavlovich down the left hand side the central defender with a deep deep cross
[5122.20 - 5127.40] P:1758.94 E:0.082379 |  which is flushed across the England goal and out of play I think it went out came back in it's given
[5127.40 - 5133.64] P:1684.97 E:0.081111 |  as a goal kick Jordan Pickford just has one or two things to say I think things have calmed down
[5133.64 - 5140.36] P:1535.57 E:0.087552 |  with the arrival of the security forces still on the far side there is an area in the stands where
[5140.36 - 5147.00] P:1583.05 E:0.081763 |  we can see lots of empty blue and white seats and people have have disappeared to away from that
[5147.00 - 5153.64] P:1554.79 E:0.083523 |  area but if you you know if you look there there are dozens and dozens of of men in black shirts
[5153.64 - 5161.72] P:1704.42 E:0.078540 |  probably ultras who are who are sitting over there and oh as uh England just have to be careful
[5161.72 - 5168.04] P:1375.06 E:0.081911 |  inside their own penalty area as Elliot Anderson is able to see the ball back to to Pickford and
[5168.04 - 5175.32] P:1593.01 E:0.086883 |  yes what those chants you could hear slobber down from the BBC Serbian services told us that they
[5175.32 - 5180.12] P:1478.57 E:0.085405 |  were anti-government chants you know feelings are running high here at the moment there were
[5180.12 - 5189.00] P:1533.86 E:0.080960 |  demonstrations in central Belgrade yesterday and the the president Alexander Vučić is very much
[5189.00 - 5195.08] P:1581.85 E:0.086114 |  the the target of that so I think that's what we're seeing here inside the stadium England
[5195.08 - 5200.36] P:1709.52 E:0.087994 |  breaking forward with Rogers now to Maduakie Maduakie again down the right clips it in it's
[5200.36 - 5206.44] P:1642.92 E:0.080826 |  headed away Rogers couldn't get there on the edge of the box actually it was the substitute Sam Argic
[5206.44 - 5211.08] P:1535.79 E:0.092079 |  who got there first and is able to play back to the halfway line England win it back there again
[5211.08 - 5215.64] P:1608.15 E:0.091165 |  Elliot Anderson strides forward with it gives it to Maduakie Maduakie left footed ball
[5215.64 - 5220.36] P:1721.96 E:0.089010 |  drifts it in just over the top of King that's headed away comes out to Rice Rice a shot that's
[5220.36 - 5225.16] P:1665.41 E:0.087190 |  blocked right across the penalty area and it actually more or less hits Pavlovic and bounces
[5225.16 - 5228.84] P:1661.45 E:0.091461 |  away off his body behind for an England corner he really is finding some pockets of space depth
[5228.84 - 5233.32] P:1780.14 E:0.101983 |  and rice we know we talk about him playing as this deep line midfielder but he's allowing with

[5257.16 - 5264.12] P:1737.39 E:0.089988 |  and of course they've got the the area of empty seats next to them as well the 8100 but Declan

[5308.60 - 5313.64] P:1916.01 E:0.094380 |  and Jonas talks about the two areas the two different areas where there's been trouble but
[5313.64 - 5321.48] P:1867.89 E:0.081243 |  that section over on the far side there is now a gap that is continuing to widen and people are
[5321.48 - 5327.24] P:1924.06 E:0.088211 |  just walking further and further away from those who that area of the ultras who have many of them
[5327.24 - 5334.12] P:1812.99 E:0.067634 |  are decked out in black there's just been another tenor announcement as well but a number of Serbian
[5334.12 - 5342.76] P:1733.87 E:0.067978 |  supporters are leaving here and well UEFA will be watching with a great deal of scrutiny won't
[5342.76 - 5348.84] P:1776.52 E:0.086206 |  they yeah absolutely the second half has been marred by scenes in the crowd and there's a real
[5348.84 - 5354.20] P:1867.27 E:0.077796 |  strange atmosphere now there's a real lull spectators leaving by the by the dozens watching
[5354.20 - 5358.92] P:1879.49 E:0.078297 |  over on the far side everyone seems to be streaming out of the stadium and there's certainly big
[5358.92 - 5363.40] P:1768.74 E:0.072460 |  patches of empty seats and as you can hear the effects might that we've had up for the for the
[5363.40 - 5368.12] P:1835.14 E:0.090079 |  noise and the incredible atmosphere in the stadium it's completely turned and changed full circle
[5368.12 - 5374.60] P:1748.52 E:0.069700 |  it's almost silent in here England have made two changes Rashford has come on for Gordon and
[5374.60 - 5380.44] P:1673.93 E:0.085955 |  Jed Spence has come on for England he is the 30th different player that Thomas Tuchel who's used
[5380.44 - 5387.48] P:1771.93 E:0.078284 |  in now his sixth game in charge but Jed Spence becomes the first muslim player to represent
[5387.64 - 5396.60] P:1769.40 E:0.070027 |  the men's senior side a proud night for Jed Spence and I'm sure he'll be hoping to inspire others
[5397.16 - 5405.08] P:1836.20 E:0.067188 |  in years to come so he comes on for Rhys James so Jed Spence has been playing actually as a left
[5405.08 - 5412.04] P:1849.08 E:0.080420 |  back for for Spurs goes in at right back instead of Rhys James as there's going to be another change
[5412.04 - 5417.88] P:1897.26 E:0.097240 |  here for Serbia and Alexander Mitrovic to receive that presentation ahead of the game
[5418.60 - 5422.20] P:1930.26 E:0.099376 |  the former fuller the Newcastle striker now playing his trade in Qatar
[5422.92 - 5428.76] P:1890.03 E:0.096048 |  comes on for his 102nd appearance and it is like the like he will replace Toussaint Blajevic
[5429.40 - 5437.72] P:1955.25 E:0.065261 |  so Alexander Mitrovic comes on but it is a string ill to England indeed I was just saying to
[5437.72 - 5444.76] P:1822.55 E:0.075103 |  slobber down as well you know that that England win 4-1 in Belgrade is still the heaviest home
[5444.76 - 5450.68] P:1700.74 E:0.078104 |  defeat that Serbia well that was actually against the old not was the old Yugoslavia wasn't it but
[5450.68 - 5457.64] P:1847.89 E:0.082062 |  so for Serbia this actually matches the defeat to Belgium in October 2012 which is actually
[5457.64 - 5463.80] P:1714.37 E:0.090872 |  their only defeat in their last 28 World Cup qualifiers at home going all the way back to 2001
[5464.60 - 5469.96] P:1693.37 E:0.096133 |  but England have been absolutely outstanding for Thomas Tuchel and Madoeco once again driving
[5470.84 - 5477.80] P:1868.03 E:0.083747 |  as Pavlovic back pedals goes through towards Rodgers try to turn stopped Lukic will bring
[5477.80 - 5482.44] P:1607.28 E:0.098505 |  the ball away for Serbia all in royal blue playing from right to left against England in white
[5482.44 - 5488.12] P:1708.86 E:0.092264 |  as Spence goes to ground makes a challenge well timed out it goes for a throw and about 19 minutes
[5488.12 - 5493.08] P:1555.31 E:0.089710 |  remaining here on BBC Radio 5 live he's kicking every ball tonight Thomas Tuchel
[5493.08 - 5496.60] P:1841.80 E:0.103264 |  there's no chance of him sitting on a drink school watching this game he's living every
[5496.60 - 5500.52] P:1646.70 E:0.095437 |  moment he's team 3 and 11 giving him the performance that is asked for and even there
[5500.52 - 5504.76] P:1765.12 E:0.087660 |  Madoeco he had a good option give the ball away and you could see the frustration on Thomas Tuchel
[5504.76 - 5510.92] P:1693.13 E:0.087128 |  he wants him to go and score more still the riot police remain in the area beneath us just slightly
[5510.92 - 5516.28] P:1734.83 E:0.092106 |  away towards our left hand side up towards Mitrovic easily knocked off the ball by Gehir
[5516.28 - 5521.96] P:1739.99 E:0.099100 |  Rashford plays it forward towards Harry Kane Harry Kane goes into a challenge with Milinkovic
[5521.96 - 5526.04] P:1709.71 E:0.100462 |  and the two captains coming together and Milinkovic is off
[5528.84 - 5534.60] P:1869.20 E:0.095509 |  the Nottingham Forest Defender has been sent off by Clemence Terpac
[5535.32 - 5545.24] P:1751.73 E:0.081304 |  Milinkovic is protesting he was the last line of defense
[5547.80 - 5554.28] P:1756.84 E:0.086393 |  and it is a straight red he must have still been about I don't know 30 yards out from goal
[5555.16 - 5560.36] P:1790.96 E:0.094553 |  but because he was making a direct run Harry Kane he wasn't running out towards the left hand side
[5560.44 - 5566.44] P:1807.80 E:0.080081 |  because he was caught Clemence Terpac has shown him a red card yeah it was the last man Harry Kane was
[5566.44 - 5572.28] P:1746.85 E:0.079562 |  about to get around clumsy tackle by Milinkovic not really no much malice in it but I think you
[5572.28 - 5575.80] P:1847.40 E:0.086748 |  could see that Harry Kane was going to get round the other side of him I think that's what's gone
[5575.80 - 5580.84] P:1731.11 E:0.089740 |  into the referee's mind Kane would have had a free run on goal the Serbian players Mitrovic
[5580.84 - 5585.00] P:1803.94 E:0.091643 |  included still surrounding the referee but the referee to his credit he had no hesitation he
[5585.00 - 5589.40] P:1781.66 E:0.086322 |  was right there he was right on the spot immediately ran over and showed the red card yeah we're
[5589.40 - 5595.16] P:1720.49 E:0.078563 |  watching the challenge again Harry Kane still down receiving treatment it's a clumsy challenge
[5595.16 - 5599.32] P:1734.96 E:0.091701 |  more than anything isn't it and the referee's deemed that to have prevented a goal scoring
[5599.32 - 5606.20] P:1754.33 E:0.085573 |  opportunity it has been checked on VAR and he's wandering off Willie Dela Jod is the VAR official
[5606.20 - 5612.04] P:1757.67 E:0.090711 |  from from France and he's just indicated to Clemence Terpac that the decision was a correct one
[5612.04 - 5619.08] P:1763.59 E:0.088349 |  and now he's got that long long walk so the captain of Serbia in any hopes of the English media
[5619.08 - 5624.12] P:1718.38 E:0.095003 |  hoping to speak to the forest defender for that managerial change at the city ground in that mix
[5624.12 - 5629.32] P:1752.63 E:0.096098 |  zone might have also just taken a bit of a turn as well because I can't really see that the
[5629.88 - 5635.80] P:1784.46 E:0.087692 |  Serbia captain will be forthcoming tonight uh Pavlovic incidentally was booked as well
[5635.80 - 5639.64] P:1685.31 E:0.104789 |  for his protest Moldova have got a goal back Norway seven Moldova one
[5641.40 - 5648.52] P:1874.18 E:0.101358 |  France two Iceland one and Bosnia one Austria two our latest scores so for the next 16 minutes
[5649.08 - 5655.88] P:1584.90 E:0.084950 |  they're going to have to see out this game with 10 men on what is a knight that is proven to be
[5655.88 - 5661.48] P:1740.79 E:0.091678 |  rather costly in more ways than one bearing in mind that Sasalukic picks up a yellow card in
[5661.48 - 5667.80] P:1699.52 E:0.087990 |  the first half he will now be suspended Malinkovic will be suspended and I'm sure as well that you
[5667.80 - 5673.64] P:1760.59 E:0.084203 |  wait for will take action for the trouble in the stands bearing in mind that those warnings from
[5673.64 - 5680.84] P:1622.83 E:0.100440 |  the Serbian FA have not been heeded as rice for the free kick kills it in Gehe is there and England
[5680.84 - 5689.24] P:1761.98 E:0.097731 |  have got a fourth goal Marge he guides it in inside the six yard area it is a comprehensive victory
[5689.24 - 5696.20] P:1771.22 E:0.091446 |  for England as they take a significant step towards the world cup next summer toughest test in the
[5696.20 - 5703.56] P:1765.11 E:0.084705 |  group Thomas Tuchel side have passed it with flying colors they lead four nil statement made Benchmark
[5703.96 - 5710.04] P:1671.94 E:0.090992 |  set great performance from England again it's such a simple free kick he spoke about set plays
[5710.04 - 5715.32] P:1678.94 E:0.094115 |  and the importance of them Declan rise with an in swinging free kick Serbia all over the shop
[5715.32 - 5721.08] P:1803.11 E:0.096686 |  just gone down to 10 men marking nowhere to be seen Mark gay he's got the freedom of the six yard
[5721.08 - 5726.12] P:1817.99 E:0.096945 |  box it's lovely ball by Declan rise over the top of everybody gay with the outside of his right
[5726.12 - 5733.24] P:1639.48 E:0.079943 |  boot beats Petrovic from close range four nil what an excellent performance his first goal
[5733.24 - 5738.76] P:1942.84 E:0.103956 |  as well so we've had first goals for England tonight from money man awake at Esri concert and
[5738.76 - 5745.16] P:1876.36 E:0.093059 |  mark gay he on his 25th appearance but what has been certainly a difficult time at his club with
[5745.16 - 5750.44] P:1853.82 E:0.099883 |  that move to Liverpool falling through on deadline day his attitude Thomas Tuchel has said has been
[5750.44 - 5757.56] P:1860.46 E:0.095041 |  absolutely spot on and he has got that fourth goal as Norway have rattled in an eighth now against
[5757.56 - 5764.68] P:1762.25 E:0.092986 |  Moldova and too many has been sent off for France as they lead Iceland by two goals to one
[5766.12 - 5771.00] P:1798.73 E:0.089683 |  Belkovic is coming on a defender for Serbia
[5775.88 - 5781.40] P:1772.82 E:0.100288 |  so he I think it was if Kovic has gone off Belkovic has come on and England have also made
[5782.36 - 5790.52] P:1590.44 E:0.089641 |  a couple of changes as I think the Serbia supporter is trying to get at the England section
[5791.16 - 5794.84] P:1805.57 E:0.099994 |  that's not very wise at all he's trying to pull down some of the St George's flags
[5795.40 - 5801.88] P:1803.68 E:0.082548 |  that are draped over the the red railings away towards our right and in fact security now are
[5801.88 - 5808.20] P:1822.51 E:0.081637 |  making sure that the reinforcements I mean how can he come through that gap he's got to climb over
[5808.28 - 5813.64] P:1778.11 E:0.081845 |  a white wall red railings and then get onto the track but he's now been taken down to the ground
[5813.64 - 5821.64] P:1613.26 E:0.072161 |  England have made changes Maddoiga and Kane are off and Watkins and Bowen are on it's all happening
[5822.44 - 5827.40] P:1645.96 E:0.092267 |  in fact the riot police now are having to go and deal with that supporter who's been apprehended and
[5827.40 - 5831.80] P:1678.93 E:0.086630 |  is still faced down on the red tarmac I tell you what Ian I'm glad you're here tonight because I don't
[5831.80 - 5835.64] P:1804.48 E:0.099862 |  fancy this walk back to the hotel I'm glad I've got you by my side you on one side and John on the
[5835.64 - 5843.48] P:1603.58 E:0.064930 |  other we'll be all right won't we I'm glad I've got you in the middle in a rapidly emptying
[5845.32 - 5849.48] P:1850.88 E:0.092652 |  Raiko Mitic Stadium here the home of Red Star since 1963
[5851.64 - 5860.28] P:1734.99 E:0.083261 |  and I'm sure the Serbian FA will not at all be impressed with the conducts of some of their
[5860.28 - 5866.44] P:1895.30 E:0.085575 |  supporters as that it'll flick downfield by Bowen spent with the at the cross from the right hand side
[5867.16 - 5872.60] P:1659.83 E:0.087280 |  there's a slip there it'll be picked up now by Bowen once again in a central area out towards
[5872.60 - 5879.56] P:1846.72 E:0.085835 |  Rashford links up well crosses the ball in towards the penalty area and then it's swept away by Kostic
[5879.56 - 5887.16] P:1660.19 E:0.067854 |  and it'll be a free kick to Serbia I'm thinking I'm watching more what's happening off the pitch
[5887.24 - 5891.64] P:1785.33 E:0.084564 |  rather than on it yeah it's been a debacle hasn't it really has the behaviour and the conducts of the
[5892.36 - 5896.84] P:1759.40 E:0.088499 |  home supporters we know there's unrest in the country at the moment but the the riot police
[5896.84 - 5901.32] P:1631.76 E:0.094386 |  they're having to do the job now they're reprimanding that supporter who tried to make his way over to
[5901.32 - 5905.72] P:1720.19 E:0.092633 |  the England supporters the stadium as you say now you can look around to our left and you can almost
[5905.72 - 5910.60] P:1757.88 E:0.086572 |  pick out the right in on the seats there has been violence there's been it would be fighting really
[5910.60 - 5913.08] P:1729.08 E:0.094350 |  they've been fighting amongst themselves haven't they yeah they have
[5915.16 - 5921.96] P:1756.89 E:0.085635 |  and I'm sure that UEFA will take note as well bearing in mind I mean this is staggering over the
[5921.96 - 5928.12] P:1808.17 E:0.072138 |  past five years the Serbian FA have been fined as I'll just hold off because Rashford in towards
[5928.12 - 5932.60] P:1899.26 E:0.098748 |  the penalty area Rashford shoots good shot as well and Petrovic with a very good save
[5933.32 - 5937.32] P:1874.46 E:0.092393 |  he opened up his body hit it right footed from just inside the area central position
[5937.32 - 5942.20] P:1816.29 E:0.081513 |  Petrovic away to his left made a tumbling save yeah it's a smart save from Petrovic this game's
[5942.20 - 5946.04] P:1779.79 E:0.096802 |  over England are picking and choosing as and when they want to attack good play that time from
[5946.04 - 5951.16] P:1873.65 E:0.074489 |  Marcus Rashford he's come on playing wide on the left and he that trademark move that we see him do
[5951.16 - 5956.04] P:1847.18 E:0.081889 |  so often cuts in alongside the edge of the 18-yard box on his right foot decent height for the
[5956.04 - 5959.72] P:1799.88 E:0.082753 |  goalkeeper Petrovic but a good save turns it around the corner England corner
[5960.84 - 5966.84] P:1687.68 E:0.085500 |  Bowen's going to take the the corner kick we've got about 11 minutes remaining here in Belgrade
[5967.88 - 5971.56] P:1695.88 E:0.095593 |  missile then it's just been lobbed from the supporters in front of us didn't reach Jared
[5971.56 - 5977.72] P:1725.45 E:0.078272 |  Bowen it'll be picked up by an official corner's taken short Bowen then towards Rice back out
[5977.72 - 5984.12] P:1684.48 E:0.082482 |  towards Rashford Rashford then with a cross only partially cleared Anderson down into the ground
[5984.12 - 5989.96] P:1710.83 E:0.089366 |  controls it runs slows it down back out towards Rashford and here is Rice once again England

[5997.00 - 6002.04] P:1608.36 E:0.093964 |  quickly sharp Chris passing Bowen now comes inside in towards the penalty area might run
[6002.04 - 6007.56] P:1778.15 E:0.098172 |  through out towards that far side gay he with a cutback saved by Petrovic his legs Declan Rice hit
[6007.56 - 6012.36] P:1787.02 E:0.092228 |  it first time left footed and Petrovic's not made the saves he had England could have got seven or
[6012.36 - 6016.68] P:1605.86 E:0.098985 |  eight here tonight yeah that's another good save by Petrovic and Bournemouth goalkeeper
[6017.24 - 6020.52] P:1864.50 E:0.114092 |  England fans away to our right they're starting to enjoy the hook they're away trip now
[6021.16 - 6026.68] P:1855.48 E:0.104122 |  really really comfortable it is now for England picking Serbia open at will the wide areas Rashford
[6027.88 - 6032.84] P:1678.88 E:0.104744 |  Declan Rice once again getting in a really good position just watching the replay excellent save
[6032.84 - 6038.12] P:1785.77 E:0.089063 |  and as you say it could have been six or seven for England there are six riot policemen stood in
[6038.12 - 6042.04] P:1577.24 E:0.103870 |  front of the England supporters I would suggest that they need to stand in front of the Serbian
[6042.84 - 6049.24] P:1801.57 E:0.089735 |  supporters I'll tell you what I'll carry on you go and tell it mate Jordan Henderson is going to be
[6049.24 - 6055.48] P:1788.37 E:0.093966 |  killing on his 85th cap he was heavily involved in the in the warm-up with the starting 11 almost
[6055.48 - 6060.84] P:1816.15 E:0.079778 |  like what you'd see as a as a coaching member of staff like a player coaching role but Jordan
[6060.84 - 6064.84] P:1880.96 E:0.088306 |  Henderson comes on Declan Rice who's had an outstanding game in the midfield makes way
[6065.40 - 6072.04] P:1691.75 E:0.084196 |  so Jordan Henderson comes on for the next nine minutes or so of normal time where England lead
[6072.04 - 6078.20] P:1587.57 E:0.086276 |  by four goals to nil and I would say now the stadium here in Belgrade is probably about half full
[6078.76 - 6084.44] P:1694.73 E:0.089807 |  judging by how many Serbian supporters have left already a lot of stewards with their luminous yellow
[6084.44 - 6089.08] P:1781.34 E:0.091037 |  jackets and out stood in front of the Serbian supporters on the far side where the corner comes
[6089.08 - 6097.00] P:1572.04 E:0.075670 |  in okay he couldn't get there if a mental turns then the ball from spent back out towards that
[6097.00 - 6102.52] P:1735.97 E:0.102407 |  far side space we're going to run into drives into the penalty area fast and across the goal
[6102.52 - 6107.64] P:1694.64 E:0.095984 |  and then it was steered in by Rashford at the far post but the flag was up and it was offside
[6108.44 - 6113.08] P:1698.37 E:0.087972 |  and that goal will not count defensively the Rashambo Serbia led down tools they just want the
[6113.08 - 6118.04] P:1727.09 E:0.091531 |  final whistle and really good play again by England this time Jarobo popping up on the left hand side
[6118.04 - 6124.20] P:1753.20 E:0.091605 |  he's got what 10 15 yards of space to run into freely into the box hammers a shot at the far post
[6124.20 - 6128.12] P:1775.08 E:0.091811 |  it's a cross come shot Marcus Rashford looked to try and tap it in at the far post but he
[6128.12 - 6133.24] P:1786.88 E:0.088778 |  strayed just offside again another good passenger play for England I didn't want to miss any of the
[6133.24 - 6138.60] P:1596.88 E:0.089108 |  action but I was going to tell you about this staggering statistic about the Serbian FA
[6138.60 - 6149.32] P:1799.21 E:0.082150 |  so over the last five years they have been fined 703,375 euros which is 30,000 euros less than the
[6149.32 - 6159.80] P:1707.18 E:0.071593 |  fines in the previous 14 years how would suggest there is going to be more incoming from from
[6159.96 - 6169.56] P:1690.77 E:0.071164 |  UEFA Norway 10 Moldova 1 Harland has now got five of those 10 goals well his week has improved
[6169.56 - 6173.48] P:1810.48 E:0.096549 |  did you see him in social media this week I didn't manage to pick up three stitches on his chin
[6173.48 - 6178.76] P:1602.19 E:0.088737 |  this week Erling Harland for a collision with the the the bus door the bus door yet inadvertently
[6178.76 - 6182.68] P:1875.70 E:0.097941 |  opened up on his chin so if you see Erling Harland playing tonight with a slight graze on his chin
[6182.68 - 6187.56] P:1824.15 E:0.075641 |  and three stitches he had a fight with a bus this week we've got seven minutes remaining
[6188.28 - 6191.88] P:1907.92 E:0.097479 |  and Jordan Pickford on course for that seventh successive clean sheet
[6193.00 - 6197.88] P:1901.16 E:0.095405 |  which actually would be his 40th clean sheet in his England career that would
[6199.72 - 6209.24] P:1778.24 E:0.067332 |  mean that only Joe Hart and Peter Shilton have kept more clean sheets because that would take
[6209.24 - 6215.40] P:1636.84 E:0.070812 |  him level with David Seaman impressive that isn't it it is he's nearly had as many clean sheets
[6215.40 - 6220.92] P:1605.31 E:0.096387 |  as I had caps I'm gonna say mind you your ratio was good Paul it was it was decent ratio 24 clean
[6220.92 - 6228.04] P:1608.44 E:0.094856 |  sheets in 41 yeah maybe slightly prematurely ended my own international career here is spent for
[6228.04 - 6234.68] P:1370.01 E:0.088260 |  England all in white the England supporters singing the national anthem every outfield player is in
[6234.68 - 6241.16] P:1580.79 E:0.086658 |  the half away towards our right hand side England their hunger levels haven't diminished they're
[6241.16 - 6246.12] P:1661.30 E:0.101237 |  still looking for more goals here is Rogers that was a nice little turn just scoops it out towards
[6246.12 - 6251.32] P:1600.94 E:0.097393 |  bowing bowing now with a shot takes an efflection might fall towards Rogers and then it's cleared
[6251.32 - 6257.40] P:1659.79 E:0.080263 |  by Kostich but Serbia really are coming under all sorts of pressure they've been superb tonight
[6257.40 - 6261.96] P:1697.80 E:0.093814 |  England they really have we spoke in the pregame show about Thomas Tuchel about what have we seen
[6261.96 - 6266.36] P:1572.61 E:0.085793 |  what we learned from him since he's taken over this is everything that we wanted to see I mean
[6266.36 - 6269.88] P:1707.29 E:0.093194 |  like you say the international managers don't get that much time with the teams they don't get that
[6269.88 - 6274.76] P:1757.11 E:0.086584 |  much time with these players to work on the training ground nor that many games in succession
[6274.76 - 6278.68] P:1629.84 E:0.094816 |  this is the first game in Thomas Tuchel's reign where we've actually gone yeah we can see what he
[6278.68 - 6283.96] P:1702.73 E:0.087863 |  wants to do here I like this they're playing a mix of longer balls playing in the right areas
[6283.96 - 6287.32] P:1732.90 E:0.089670 |  they're pressed high they've been really impressive Rashford again jinking his way
[6287.32 - 6292.04] P:1735.24 E:0.093247 |  towards the penalty area still going ball stuck to his feet place it out the area shot then comes
[6292.04 - 6296.12] P:1643.69 E:0.093298 |  in from Anderson went to try and place it with a curling effort blocked Liberamento over on that
[6296.12 - 6300.92] P:1671.95 E:0.096945 |  far side England lead by four goals to nil just have a five minutes to go to halftime live on five
[6300.92 - 6308.04] P:1696.93 E:0.077525 |  live as the ball is cleared but just Serbia can't get out they are being forced back and this is
[6308.04 - 6313.72] P:1546.71 E:0.088569 |  spent this has been so impressive from an England point of view and they're going to equal a record
[6313.72 - 6319.88] P:1499.85 E:0.084265 |  as well because it would be seven competitive games where they have not conceded which would
[6319.88 - 6326.04] P:1664.92 E:0.089825 |  actually equal a record set by the Subabi Robson side in the late 80s October 88 to October
[6326.12 - 6334.36] P:1498.36 E:0.081685 |  89 four nil they leave under five minutes to go we're on and through till 10 30 will bring you
[6334.36 - 6339.72] P:1536.59 E:0.089519 |  as much live reaction as we can if not it'll be in the five live football daily part Tony
[6339.72 - 6345.80] P:1548.24 E:0.098140 |  Libsson remember takes over at 10 30 on five live England supporters two and a half thousand of them
[6345.80 - 6353.48] P:1683.77 E:0.087548 |  stealing good voice away towards our right here is spent out towards Rogers Rogers back inside to
[6353.80 - 6361.24] P:1432.81 E:0.087426 |  Henderson they have always a slip there by Anderson in the midfield but then given away by
[6361.24 - 6367.96] P:1683.82 E:0.089321 |  Mitrovic going stopped Mitrovic picks it up deep inside his own half for for Serbia quickly crowded
[6367.96 - 6372.60] P:1594.22 E:0.093001 |  though by England who are still hunting impacts for the ball still chasing the ball down even in this
[6372.60 - 6381.96] P:1686.01 E:0.084931 |  late stage what would you say has caught your eye the most I think Maddoek he's been outstanding on
[6381.96 - 6385.80] P:1663.15 E:0.094099 |  the right hand side until he Gordon's played well and I think the way that the the wide players
[6385.80 - 6390.04] P:1707.94 E:0.086945 |  stretch the pitch made the game open and allowed England to play but I think the biggest change
[6390.04 - 6395.64] P:1861.09 E:0.077788 |  you can see tonight the directness that instead of the five six seven passes to try and create something
[6395.64 - 6401.72] P:1728.39 E:0.083753 |  they'll go over the top or play slightly more direct and then play in the right areas it's been a
[6401.72 - 6407.16] P:1594.12 E:0.086386 |  possession with intent it's been a real performance from England tonight they've set out to win a game
[6407.16 - 6410.36] P:1793.35 E:0.093167 |  and they've carried out exactly what the manager said they were going to do I've been really really
[6410.44 - 6415.48] P:1688.04 E:0.070228 |  impressed with them and it's a long time since I've said that about England yes yeah it's the
[6415.48 - 6420.76] P:1886.48 E:0.091696 |  the first glimpse as you say we certainly didn't see anything from Thomas Tuchel in his first five
[6420.76 - 6427.64] P:1722.95 E:0.076088 |  games in charge but to be fair to him he's been maintaining all along that progress was being
[6427.64 - 6433.48] P:1771.24 E:0.085990 |  made certainly the the field from the England camp at St George's Park that it's been a good week
[6434.12 - 6441.96] P:1617.73 E:0.085825 |  in the in the training when they arrived albeit delayed last night few two I think storms delayed
[6441.96 - 6449.24] P:1612.70 E:0.076601 |  that takeoff from Birmingham airport they arrived in really really good heart and speaking to Harry
[6449.24 - 6453.48] P:1715.94 E:0.100708 |  K and they were optimistic there's now they're racing away and it's Rashford on that far side
[6453.48 - 6458.04] P:1692.37 E:0.095972 |  the left who's been sent clear and Rashford now carries the ball to the edge of the area with
[6458.04 - 6462.36] P:1669.37 E:0.099800 |  pace enters the box slips it into the path of Watkins who goes down referee has a good look
[6462.44 - 6466.60] P:1765.23 E:0.088638 |  at that wats his finger and says no penalty York to Tam with Nill as the latest score in the
[6466.60 - 6470.68] P:1579.72 E:0.096430 |  National League this is five line oh that was a penalty that looked all the world for a penalty
[6470.68 - 6475.16] P:1779.89 E:0.104543 |  only Watkins still down in the box on the way to our right hand side Marcus Rashford does extremely
[6475.16 - 6479.72] P:1844.00 E:0.089823 |  well half a lend to the pitch gets into the box sees Watkins on his outside Thomas Tuchel
[6479.72 - 6484.52] P:1787.25 E:0.087919 |  stood by nose on the edge of his dugout arms are wide I'm still asking the referee forn him up
[6484.52 - 6490.44] P:1737.16 E:0.081772 |  is not happy I mean that's a really clumsy challenge on Ollie Watkins Orakovic I think it is
[6490.44 - 6495.40] P:1818.83 E:0.091181 |  and it's a stone wall penalty for me I'm sure that VAR will check it how he's not given it
[6495.40 - 6498.68] P:1647.63 E:0.087175 |  is seeing it the referee's been excellent this evening England players around the referee
[6498.68 - 6504.12] P:1711.80 E:0.071103 |  they want a penalty seeing one replay and it looked all the world a penalty well Harry Kane
[6504.76 - 6509.72] P:1667.05 E:0.093137 |  is off the field of course he scored his last 31 penalties for club and country this has got to
[6509.72 - 6516.60] P:1636.22 E:0.086615 |  be a penalty Jordan Henderson now is in the in the ear of Clemence Epper but having a look at it again
[6517.56 - 6522.28] P:1697.85 E:0.099437 |  it has to be a penalty surely he's coming over he's coming over to this game I mean we've only
[6522.28 - 6527.24] P:1626.50 E:0.089310 |  been privy to one replay but I mean we are sat quite a distance away from the pitch and the
[6527.24 - 6531.32] P:1679.95 E:0.098818 |  incident but I mean you could see quite clearly from up here I mean you could see Ollie Watkins
[6531.32 - 6535.56] P:1798.88 E:0.089514 |  reaction I mean at four nil up he's not going to dive in that situation he's gone over and it's a
[6535.56 - 6541.72] P:1731.67 E:0.085475 |  really clumsy challenge and it's it's it will be given as a penalty well Serbia's record defeat
[6541.72 - 6547.24] P:1771.39 E:0.104471 |  overall was a way to Ukraine in 2019 when they lost 5 nil the penalty has been awarded
[6547.24 - 6553.48] P:1827.36 E:0.090888 |  and England now have got an opportunity to get that fifth goal Erykovich with a challenge on Rashford
[6555.00 - 6559.32] P:1674.03 E:0.096672 |  and it's been a sorry night for Serbia this really could put the icing on the cake for England
[6559.32 - 6563.16] P:1658.46 E:0.102071 |  everything that we spoke about before what we wanted to see from England this is what we've
[6563.16 - 6568.12] P:1760.76 E:0.092710 |  been waiting for this type of performance in what was potentially a really difficult place
[6568.12 - 6572.60] P:1898.14 E:0.098288 |  and you and John have spoke about the stats and how long it is since Serbia have lost the game
[6572.60 - 6577.56] P:1654.49 E:0.092529 |  here and the intimidating atmosphere this on paper was a really difficult place for England to come
[6577.56 - 6582.92] P:1740.76 E:0.086552 |  tonight and they've certainly put in one of the best performances in a long time. Marcus Rashford
[6582.92 - 6587.96] P:1779.47 E:0.093261 |  has been given the ball he places it down on the spot England all in white are playing from left
[6587.96 - 6595.24] P:1830.07 E:0.088591 |  to right as we look he's up against Jordy Petrovic who stands on his goal line
[6595.32 - 6606.04] P:1880.73 E:0.086488 |  Marcus Rashford waits he's almost side on before he starts his run up he's giving no clues as to
[6606.04 - 6610.52] P:1995.47 E:0.099660 |  which way this is going now he takes a couple of steps back a stuttering run up from Rashford
[6611.08 - 6618.52] P:1921.02 E:0.098718 |  and Rashford scores slots it in with ease Marcus Rashford with his first goal in almost two years
[6619.08 - 6627.16] P:1832.97 E:0.090639 |  for England seals what has been a five star display sorry night for Serbia Serbia nil England five
[6629.24 - 6635.16] P:1869.20 E:0.092575 |  job well and truly done mission accomplished here in Serbia tonight excellent performance Marcus
[6635.16 - 6640.84] P:1960.42 E:0.094433 |  Rashford the trademark no luck penalty like we've seen Ivan Tony do over the years waits for the
[6640.84 - 6646.60] P:1929.25 E:0.089549 |  goalkeeper sideways run up stutters almost kicks it off one step watches the goalkeeper and as soon
[6646.60 - 6651.24] P:1860.75 E:0.087806 |  as the goalkeeper drops his shoulder Marcus Rashford places it into the other side all round
[6651.24 - 6656.36] P:1736.30 E:0.091883 |  excellent evening for Thomas Tuchel and England if you were to say a five star display then for
[6656.36 - 6660.92] P:1803.15 E:0.081513 |  England what could you say for Norway as they've just got another goal heaven 11
[6662.44 - 6673.96] P:1835.87 E:0.072378 |  Norway 11 Moldova one and the Rangers Taylor Asgard has got a hat trick for for Norway so five
[6674.04 - 6679.56] P:1804.27 E:0.092490 |  for Erling Harland and three for Asgard three minutes have added on time here in Belgrade
[6680.36 - 6687.80] P:1854.63 E:0.083111 |  England leads Serbia five nil so it is a joint record heaviest defeat for Serbia as we will go
[6687.80 - 6693.48] P:1735.20 E:0.085849 |  Wales Canada and Molly Stevens yeah Wales nil at Canada one we're into three minutes of added
[6693.48 - 6698.52] P:1798.54 E:0.094543 |  time here Ian Mark Harris very nearly got the equaliser for Wales in the past few minutes but
[6698.52 - 6703.48] P:1758.46 E:0.097981 |  I have to say Canada have played some brilliant football tonight really exciting to see what the
[6703.48 - 6709.72] P:1801.09 E:0.085786 |  World Cup cohorts can do next year at the World Cup Wales nil Canada one thank you Molly
[6710.76 - 6716.76] P:1915.73 E:0.097703 |  England incidentally have scored now in each of their last 22 World Cup qualifiers 67 goals in
[6716.76 - 6723.40] P:1679.32 E:0.079763 |  that process going all the way back to 2016 and a goal a straw away to Slovenia I don't think there'll
[6723.48 - 6729.32] P:1590.04 E:0.095647 |  be anybody left in the Serbia area of this stadium you know very very rapidly emptied
[6730.04 - 6734.44] P:1668.10 E:0.088268 |  started slowly in the second half people trickling away when the violence started
[6734.44 - 6738.36] P:1575.20 E:0.088947 |  but now it's almost empty isn't it apart from England fans away to our right who will no
[6738.36 - 6743.00] P:1657.03 E:0.085907 |  doubt be kept in but they will certainly enjoyed what they watched this evening yes they will
[6743.00 - 6750.92] P:1675.97 E:0.078036 |  some of the horns are being sounded as well as we've got 60 seconds remaining and we'll try and
[6750.92 - 6755.96] P:1857.09 E:0.093454 |  bring you as much live reaction as we can before five live sport finishes at 10 30
[6756.84 - 6765.24] P:1897.90 E:0.083051 |  but the there is indeed the final whistle so impressive oh no that was the whistle from
[6765.24 - 6771.16] P:1738.59 E:0.081648 |  that's the whistle in the crowd that for me on that occasion did you the players stopped as well
[6771.16 - 6776.60] P:1811.57 E:0.075225 |  I know it wasn't just you the players had stopped even the England supporters cheered too I thought
[6776.68 - 6780.92] P:1719.16 E:0.093081 |  he was blowing early the England support staff have all got up off the bench and started to pack up
[6780.92 - 6787.88] P:1756.77 E:0.074922 |  as well I'm glad it wasn't just me here is here is Spence he hasn't watched the referee

[6848.28 - 6853.64] P:1865.64 E:0.091775 |  tonight but like I say it's what you want to see it's what you expect from England we've got the
[6853.64 - 6858.60] P:1763.90 E:0.087493 |  quality of players but we've not been able to get that type of tune out of them before Thomas Tuchel

[6862.68 - 6867.72] P:1826.35 E:0.091097 |  performance out of them tonight that was impressive certainly was Canaan Madiwakar in the first half
[6867.72 - 6874.36] P:1626.73 E:0.096216 |  Kansa Gehi and a Rashford penalty in the second half giving England that five nil victory as you

[7032.60 - 7037.40] P:1769.02 E:0.073909 |  lift off is that fair comment yeah I think so it was always going to be a tough game to go to
[7037.40 - 7042.44] P:1756.82 E:0.099520 |  Serbia and get the win let alone winning the style that we have we scored some good goals we scored
[7042.44 - 7047.32] P:1811.54 E:0.086489 |  some good set of pieces every box pretty much ticked and we said before obviously we're missing
[7047.32 - 7051.56] P:1679.86 E:0.106938 |  some key players but sometimes that gives opportunities to players they potentially wouldn't have got a
[7051.56 - 7057.80] P:1833.32 E:0.093799 |  chance and I think those lads have done really well tonight Paul England managers when they come in
[7057.80 - 7061.96] P:1577.14 E:0.093156 |  all managers really but England managers in particular they need a statement win a statement
[7061.96 - 7066.36] P:1613.62 E:0.078830 |  performance has Thomas Tuchel got that now said it before the game that's what we needed
[7066.36 - 7071.08] P:1714.91 E:0.073712 |  and absolutely I mean that's the best that I've seen an England team play for a long time I mean we
[7071.08 - 7079.32] P:1711.09 E:0.072740 |  saw in the the previous games against Andorra Latvia Albania they won the games but they didn't
[7079.32 - 7084.44] P:1717.76 E:0.080727 |  win them convincingly that's the type of performance that we should have seen against the lesser sides
[7084.44 - 7088.52] P:1746.67 E:0.081399 |  if you like I mean England if it wasn't for Petrovic tonight in golfer Serbia England could have had
[7088.52 - 7093.16] P:1812.92 E:0.081193 |  six seven eight goals they were that good tonight you know Serbia folded at the end when Malenkovic
[7093.16 - 7098.12] P:1826.57 E:0.080586 |  got sent off but England reduced them to that England battered them into the corner they just
[7098.12 - 7102.36] P:1728.07 E:0.078368 |  didn't take their foot off the pedal tonight they pressed high they won the ball back they used
[7102.36 - 7107.72] P:1740.55 E:0.092689 |  the ball wisely in areas they used the set plays Madiwek and Gordon were outstanding in the wide
[7107.72 - 7113.16] P:1831.96 E:0.084307 |  areas and it was just a really impressive all-round performance and in answer to your original question
[7113.16 - 7118.52] P:1699.97 E:0.080803 |  absolutely that was a statement win and Paul those two goals coming round about the half
[7118.52 - 7123.64] P:1732.23 E:0.083903 |  hour mark for Harry Kane and Nonny Madwaking meant that Serbia had to come out we said this at a
[7123.64 - 7127.56] P:1683.54 E:0.093898 |  halftime that England were going to find that there were more opportunities in the second half
[7127.56 - 7131.88] P:1696.83 E:0.087226 |  but just talk to me about the performance up to that point for that first half hour you talked
[7131.88 - 7137.32] P:1882.09 E:0.076346 |  about England sort of grinding Serbia down yeah they were constant they just didn't go away and
[7137.32 - 7142.76] P:1899.23 E:0.077190 |  when they did lose possession they wanted to win it back and it wasn't just isolated incidents of
[7142.76 - 7147.56] P:1738.27 E:0.089719 |  individuals pressing they pressed as a team they pressed as a unit we all talk about you know in
[7147.56 - 7152.44] P:1832.17 E:0.090889 |  the media and in the press teams got to have an identity you know what's what's an identity what
[7152.44 - 7157.96] P:1748.70 E:0.083903 |  does it look like that tonight is an identity they pressed as a team they pressed as a unit they
[7157.96 - 7162.36] P:1792.56 E:0.090177 |  won the ball back but when they won the ball back the two wide players got wide they made the pitch
[7162.36 - 7166.76] P:1805.50 E:0.093051 |  big the relationship between Deckham Rice and Anderson was impressive the whole spine through
[7166.76 - 7172.28] P:1830.04 E:0.085760 |  the team Konza and Gage you know kept the Serbian strikers very very quiet all over the pitch every
[7172.28 - 7177.08] P:1859.64 E:0.069615 |  single individual won their battles yes we'll say you know that's what should be happening but it
[7177.08 - 7180.84] P:1858.50 E:0.078207 |  hasn't previously happened like I said to you I watched the game at Villa Park at the weekend
[7180.84 - 7185.88] P:1903.57 E:0.082753 |  and like many others I was thoroughly underwhelmed by it tonight I was excited to watch that that was
[7185.88 - 7190.52] P:1597.93 E:0.089031 |  a good England performance to be fair I couldn't agree more Paul like they've gone into a little
[7190.52 - 7194.28] P:1810.21 E:0.089640 |  bit of an intimidating atmosphere and they've done something that's quite nice for the England team is
[7194.28 - 7198.60] P:1726.40 E:0.101874 |  to to recognise the Serbia team was under a little bit of pressure they've not scored many goals
[7199.16 - 7204.20] P:1892.49 E:0.091875 |  you could see their fans could potentially turn and for once rather than a team coming in
[7204.20 - 7208.60] P:1857.64 E:0.097361 |  shorts or trying to quiet down the English players and team we went there quieting them down and we
[7209.40 - 7212.44] P:1763.91 E:0.102934 |  a thoroughly professional performance together we're quite a young squad as well quite a lot of
[7212.44 - 7217.80] P:1875.14 E:0.072280 |  young lads as I said before they played together the 21s took their chance tonight that was actually
[7217.80 - 7224.20] P:1938.06 E:0.080898 |  the remit as well Phil Thomas Tuchel when he was addressing the players they wanted the message
[7224.20 - 7229.08] P:1967.66 E:0.087890 |  was to keep the ball let's try and control the crowd early on they were so proactive from the
[7229.08 - 7235.80] P:2017.26 E:0.081980 |  first whistle carried out his his message to a to a to a tee and also as well Kelly that in
[7235.88 - 7241.88] P:1999.44 E:0.080075 |  those in his six games that was for what was the toughest test for England the most
[7243.08 - 7248.76] P:2017.26 E:0.084522 |  inexperienced team that he's named the starting 11 only had 340 caps so that's the least experience
[7248.76 - 7253.88] P:1996.36 E:0.078815 |  side he's picked in his six games and as Paul has already alluded to so many impressive performances
[7253.88 - 7257.64] P:1622.35 E:0.078990 |  in that 11 by far the best performance without a shadow of a doubt and that happens quite often
[7257.64 - 7261.08] P:1959.90 E:0.084666 |  you know when you look at the the players that are not in the squad I mean we spoke about it before
[7261.08 - 7266.68] P:1903.28 E:0.069634 |  the game Grealish Foden Trent Alexander-Arnold Saka Wharton Bellingham you know those players
[7266.68 - 7270.76] P:1769.68 E:0.071267 |  were likely to come back into the squad at some point but quite often when you have big names
[7270.76 - 7276.04] P:1832.02 E:0.088759 |  missing the team then becomes the star and the team tonight for England they were united they were
[7276.04 - 7279.72] P:2017.21 E:0.087650 |  there was a lot of cohesion there was a lot of understanding and you could see relationships
[7279.72 - 7283.56] P:1860.92 E:0.089804 |  forming on the pitch the right hand side was the most dangerous for England with Rhys James and
[7283.56 - 7287.72] P:1592.00 E:0.082837 |  Maddoekie really impressed with the way that Maddoekie played tonight a lot of positives
[7287.80 - 7295.16] P:1736.88 E:0.082811 |  he's hit 30 players used already Thomas Tuchel as he tries to kind of to come across that that first
[7295.16 - 7300.20] P:1833.79 E:0.090785 |  choice starting 11 that we talked about in the build-up to the game and it's worth mentioning
[7300.20 - 7308.36] P:1788.58 E:0.086392 |  as well Phil the players we touched on this earlier on Palmer Bellingham Foden Stones Saka Alexander-Arnold
[7309.00 - 7314.28] P:1961.71 E:0.089722 |  not in the not available for for this game yeah we know how good this jump in depth is but
[7314.92 - 7320.12] P:1893.83 E:0.089031 |  you sort of don't really want it at the same extent and it's a great headache now for Thomas
[7320.12 - 7325.72] P:1802.26 E:0.091334 |  Tuchel but those players that have played especially tonight have put their name down to put a marker
[7325.72 - 7329.96] P:1777.88 E:0.084225 |  down now and it's going to be tough for those players no matter how well they play to come and
[7329.96 - 7334.84] P:1968.88 E:0.087567 |  ask to be starting in the next game so it's a great headache to have as Paul said the relationships
[7334.84 - 7340.20] P:1737.32 E:0.080189 |  that were that look like they'd they'd formed even over tonight but you know working especially on
[7340.20 - 7346.52] P:1751.23 E:0.076624 |  the right side even obviously Morgan Morgan and then number 10 and things like that you know these
[7346.52 - 7351.32] P:1782.71 E:0.084031 |  are going to be tough people to move and you know if I was in the England squad tonight and I saw that
[7351.32 - 7355.80] P:1738.09 E:0.069520 |  game I know I've got a lot of hard work to try and get back in there the other game that took place
[7355.80 - 7361.96] P:1738.45 E:0.084766 |  tonight in England's group Albania beat Latvia by a goal to nil so the table looks like this
[7361.96 - 7367.32] P:1816.66 E:0.075482 |  England are top having played five games with 15 points maximum number of points as we know from
[7367.32 - 7373.08] P:1839.15 E:0.075415 |  from their games with a goal difference of 13 Albania are second with eight points Serbia eight
[7373.08 - 7377.80] P:1775.99 E:0.075522 |  points behind England now although Serbia have played a game less Latvia on five games with four
[7377.80 - 7382.20] P:1675.14 E:0.082886 |  points and or at the bottom with with no points from their opening games England now only need
[7382.20 - 7386.92] P:1659.28 E:0.080577 |  five games I think five points from the the remaining games I think Deno I will take your
[7386.92 - 7393.72] P:1818.04 E:0.073012 |  mathematics with that lady Kelly I think they need five points from that they're remaining three
[7393.72 - 7399.48] P:1874.86 E:0.089290 |  games in in this group which puts them Paul in a really really comfortable position and look they've
[7399.48 - 7406.04] P:1824.88 E:0.074693 |  they've had as you said steady performances or steady results really with with low key performances
[7406.04 - 7410.60] P:1978.81 E:0.085823 |  tonight has kind of changed all of that and it's shown what what this group of players are capable
[7410.60 - 7415.72] P:1777.35 E:0.088624 |  of was there something in the way that that England set up I know you talked about the new players
[7415.72 - 7419.96] P:1736.65 E:0.086221 |  coming in the fact that they're they're not necessarily experienced players but was there more
[7420.60 - 7424.92] P:1881.74 E:0.066830 |  attacking talent was it a more attacking attempt what was the difference in this performance
[7424.92 - 7429.48] P:1784.60 E:0.088931 |  it was the intent it was the tempo immediately that the game was played at and when they they
[7429.48 - 7433.80] P:2013.74 E:0.071791 |  took the kickoff Declan Rice went straight back to Jordan Pickford but when England had the kickoff
[7433.80 - 7438.44] P:1872.91 E:0.083782 |  every single player in a white shirt was on the halfway line it was a set play it went back from
[7438.44 - 7443.00] P:2017.57 E:0.081034 |  Declan Rice to Jordan Pickford who then launched it into the Serbia penalty area and they want to
[7443.00 - 7447.32] P:1762.34 E:0.076395 |  throw in deep in in Serbia half I mean nothing came of it but they weren't afraid to play these
[7447.32 - 7452.52] P:1753.54 E:0.084185 |  longer balls into certain areas and then allow their talent to play football in the right areas
[7452.52 - 7456.84] P:1810.17 E:0.074327 |  they didn't put the ball at risk at the back we quite often see teams over playing rolling the
[7456.84 - 7460.92] P:1956.81 E:0.070278 |  goal kicks across the six yard line we didn't see so much of that yes there was incidents in the
[7460.92 - 7464.92] P:1853.68 E:0.082332 |  game where they played around at the back and they they controlled the game is the best way of
[7464.92 - 7469.48] P:1957.69 E:0.082960 |  describing it there's there's a time and a place to keep the ball and rotate possession in and
[7469.48 - 7474.04] P:1843.51 E:0.076988 |  around your own 18 yard box without putting the ball at risk and England did that and the
[7474.12 - 7478.68] P:1841.50 E:0.074202 |  possession the tempo and the control over anything was the most impressive thing that
[7478.68 - 7483.72] P:1885.88 E:0.072938 |  England had tonight because from the first whistle to the last they were in complete control and you
[7483.72 - 7488.20] P:1872.85 E:0.077418 |  could see exactly what they were trying to employ the whole game it was it was good it really was
[7488.20 - 7494.60] P:1790.54 E:0.070846 |  Kelly and just some extra context to that Serbia have lost just one of their last 28 home world
[7494.60 - 7501.56] P:1845.82 E:0.077180 |  cup qualifiers since 2001 and that was defeat by Belgium in 2012 this is not an easy place
[7501.56 - 7505.56] P:1648.67 E:0.086015 |  for any team to go and and get the result and England have done it in style with that that
[7505.56 - 7511.64] P:1910.35 E:0.076572 |  five-nil victory Phil you said that if you were maybe one of the more senior more experienced
[7511.64 - 7516.28] P:1751.76 E:0.080529 |  England players who wasn't involved this evening you'd be knowing that you'd have to work hard
[7516.28 - 7520.68] P:1801.21 E:0.076751 |  to get your place back in the squad who do you think's done a done a good job for England who's
[7520.68 - 7525.40] P:1878.30 E:0.061497 |  going to put themselves right in there in the manager's thinking well I think we alluded to it
[7525.48 - 7532.84] P:1834.10 E:0.081882 |  before obviously Maddoek is obviously shown out Morgan Rogers in the 10 again and we spoke about
[7532.84 - 7537.48] P:1552.57 E:0.098366 |  who's going to play sort of the holding holding midfielder you know again Anderson came in did
[7537.48 - 7542.36] P:1838.28 E:0.085476 |  another good job it's difficult obviously he'll chop and change again but it's a it's a really
[7542.36 - 7547.32] P:1786.91 E:0.077277 |  nice thing to know that basically whoever normally gets that position that role now is going to have
[7547.32 - 7552.28] P:1880.58 E:0.072491 |  to step his game up and that's what it should be it should be the hardest squad to get into
[7552.36 - 7554.52] P:1689.79 E:0.093214 |  because we've got so many good players and that's the way it should be but
[7555.56 - 7558.92] P:1859.35 E:0.101769 |  I'm sure we'll be having all sorts of different types of conversations when the squad's announced
[7558.92 - 7563.16] P:1820.24 E:0.090802 |  next time and there's probably people not in it or different people starting different places but
[7563.16 - 7567.80] P:1931.95 E:0.082861 |  that's where we're at but hopefully Thomas Tushal's found out a few things about his his squad and his
[7567.80 - 7571.88] P:1965.20 E:0.084408 |  players you know they can play in tough atmospheres tough places to go as you just said they don't
[7571.88 - 7577.72] P:1860.05 E:0.087337 |  lose games at home so they'll be a lot alone get battered five-nil so a massive massive box ticked
[7577.72 - 7582.68] P:1804.86 E:0.093282 |  as far as character and and stuff goes tonight and he'll be looking to take that forward obviously
[7582.68 - 7587.48] P:1681.83 E:0.082286 |  to the fed-up on him for the World Cup I tell you what's interesting Kelly is that is that Thomas Tuchal
[7588.04 - 7592.84] P:1890.55 E:0.078259 |  just particularly if we focus on the right back you know Alexander Arnold and Kyle Walker have been
[7592.84 - 7599.56] P:1942.96 E:0.075967 |  admitted from the squad and Thomas Tuchal sees that Rhys James and Tino Livremento are ahead of
[7599.56 - 7603.96] P:1831.36 E:0.071574 |  Alexander Arnold and Walker for that right back slot at the minute but the versatility of Tino
[7603.96 - 7609.00] P:1893.90 E:0.072953 |  Livremento is that tonight he played as a left back you know Rhys James earlier on the campaign
[7609.00 - 7613.88] P:1860.59 E:0.078373 |  played as a left back so the two who he sees vying to keep out Walker and Alexander Arnold
[7613.88 - 7620.36] P:1791.41 E:0.071370 |  in the right back slot have both played as a left back in this campaign and he's got a lot of options
[7620.36 - 7625.24] P:1881.55 E:0.080744 |  in defense as Thomas Tuchal in that respect I think the options he's got I mean we all talk about
[7625.24 - 7630.52] P:1878.87 E:0.072984 |  his as he does he know his best 11 he will never pick the same 11 as an international manager
[7630.52 - 7633.88] P:1863.09 E:0.081484 |  because you'll have players are out of form players who are injured and like we said the players
[7633.88 - 7637.24] P:1868.04 E:0.079423 |  that are missing from this squad but the players that aren't in the squad or the players that
[7637.24 - 7642.60] P:1757.27 E:0.073096 |  didn't play tonight will watch that performance and they will know that that's what is expected of them
[7642.60 - 7647.88] P:1925.82 E:0.068665 |  now that's the way they've got to play and that's what the manager wants his best 11 is listen you'll
[7647.88 - 7652.60] P:1860.85 E:0.083966 |  never be able to do that as an international manager because of the the rotation of players
[7652.60 - 7657.40] P:1937.96 E:0.069775 |  but he certainly if those players are fit and available next time it'll be interesting to see
[7657.40 - 7662.92] P:1991.33 E:0.078081 |  what he does it's happened three times that England have named an unchanged side three times
[7662.92 - 7671.16] P:1797.85 E:0.079376 |  since 1982 right so that puts that one into context and just on the on the liveamento point and on
[7671.16 - 7676.68] P:1823.26 E:0.075134 |  that that idea that his maybe his right backs can can also play as left backs do you think that's
[7676.68 - 7681.64] P:1559.08 E:0.081622 |  deliberate from from Tuchal and that he wants to bring versatile players into the into the squad
[7681.64 - 7686.44] P:1791.57 E:0.086938 |  because over the course of a tournament as as everybody's kind of alluded to there are going
[7686.44 - 7689.80] P:1732.80 E:0.088920 |  to be injuries there are going to be players in and out of form there are going to be situations
[7689.80 - 7694.44] P:1874.77 E:0.075918 |  where you'll your need players to do something other than what their their first choice position is
[7694.44 - 7700.28] P:1922.45 E:0.078803 |  yeah I think so definitely I mean it'll be it'll be a squad of 26 but in in that as well you're
[7700.28 - 7706.28] P:2003.93 E:0.071720 |  going to have you could well Lewis Skelly as well he was not included in the matchday squad of 23
[7706.28 - 7712.04] P:1860.03 E:0.066235 |  today but he's he's been a I thought was going to be a regular at left back you've got you know
[7712.04 - 7717.64] P:1939.08 E:0.078384 |  the potential for Hall at Newcastle possibly as well so that he's he's got these options on the
[7717.64 - 7722.36] P:1743.64 E:0.080110 |  evidence of what we've seen so far I think it might be hard particularly for for Kyle Walker as
[7722.36 - 7728.36] P:1885.17 E:0.070035 |  well as Alexander Arnold to get back into this England squad because Livremento I thought
[7728.36 - 7731.64] P:1706.02 E:0.073709 |  played really really well tonight he looked comfortable you know that was only his second
[7731.64 - 7736.28] P:1968.72 E:0.079525 |  start for his his country and he looked very much at ease this is going to sound daft but he likes
[7736.28 - 7741.00] P:1911.54 E:0.070172 |  full backs that are able to defend and he wants a full back the first thing with his full backs
[7741.08 - 7745.64] P:1802.95 E:0.081078 |  able to defend in a tight narrow back four but also give him something going forward and I think
[7745.64 - 7750.12] P:1933.50 E:0.076058 |  maybe with Trent Alexander Arnold I'm not necessarily sure that he trusts him defensively
[7750.12 - 7754.20] P:1792.36 E:0.080570 |  above what he's got in his squad now Jed Spence playing as a left back for Tottenham this season
[7754.20 - 7760.04] P:1783.18 E:0.067261 |  comes on tonight for his England Davies as a right back and in the process becomes the first player
[7760.04 - 7768.20] P:1838.02 E:0.077606 |  to represent England who is Muslim so kind of a huge watershed moment for for him as well in
[7768.20 - 7773.24] P:1877.13 E:0.086754 |  terms of that and I'm sure we'll hear more from him on on that so five different goal scorers for
[7773.24 - 7778.76] P:1787.44 E:0.082357 |  for England this evening there was a conversation we were having beforehand and I think Ian it was
[7778.76 - 7785.16] P:1828.02 E:0.084135 |  it was you who made the point about about Harry Kane that perhaps England were too reliant on him
[7785.16 - 7790.20] P:1721.55 E:0.094686 |  and not that he's unreliable but there maybe there weren't too many options outside of Harry Kane
[7790.20 - 7796.60] P:1817.52 E:0.073250 |  for England does five different scorers on the on the score sheet help to to solve that problem
[7796.60 - 7802.12] P:1760.30 E:0.079060 |  I think so yeah but also I think going back over the last 20 odd internationals England only the
[7802.12 - 7807.40] P:1980.07 E:0.074138 |  second time they've scored five goals so it's been a while since England put a team to to the
[7807.40 - 7812.44] P:1843.95 E:0.085015 |  sword if you like I think Ireland 5-0 last autumn was the only other time that it's happened in
[7812.44 - 7818.44] P:1842.01 E:0.069907 |  in in recent matches from an England point of view but yeah I think it does in that respect I think
[7818.44 - 7823.72] P:1845.26 E:0.076324 |  it will always please any manager when you get five different goal scorers and for Harry Kane I mean
[7823.80 - 7830.44] P:2035.79 E:0.069005 |  in the last 40 internationals he's played 33 Watkins has played five Tony who I think is going
[7830.44 - 7834.12] P:1991.54 E:0.076137 |  to struggle to get back into the squad just the want and he's got the option as well of
[7834.12 - 7839.00] P:2021.96 E:0.076332 |  his uh it was against Greece last October he played Foden in a false nine but if you speak to
[7839.00 - 7845.16] P:1812.74 E:0.078452 |  Thomas Tuchel Kelly he would say well Rogers can play there Rashford can play there Bo Boing could
[7845.16 - 7850.68] P:1775.95 E:0.061984 |  play there so they have got a number of options and of course the England captain Harry Kane is so
[7850.68 - 7855.24] P:1740.39 E:0.090849 |  rarely out of form he always delivers for England he's done it again this evening against Serbia
[7855.24 - 7859.40] P:1682.62 E:0.082630 |  with the opening goal in that five-nil victory here is the England captain with John Murray
[7860.04 - 7865.08] P:1650.24 E:0.077341 |  yes here he is Kelly Harry Kane congratulations that was a bit of a statement wasn't it yeah
[7865.08 - 7869.24] P:1653.49 E:0.093790 |  absolutely you know I spoke a lot yesterday about you know how we wanted to play and and
[7869.24 - 7874.76] P:1607.40 E:0.081042 |  being on the front foot and being aggressive and I think we showed our level today um you know even
[7874.76 - 7878.84] P:1660.65 E:0.087663 |  in the other games I feel like we've done well but we haven't quite reached and a top form tonight
[7878.84 - 7883.08] P:1581.16 E:0.085749 |  was totally different you come away to a place like this against a good side score five make it
[7883.08 - 7888.12] P:1522.73 E:0.088274 |  look really comfortable we can be really proud of proud of ourselves so it's been a great camp and
[7888.12 - 7893.00] P:1555.92 E:0.075876 |  we're in a great position now it's good right from the off wasn't it tonight yeah you could go all the
[7893.00 - 7896.92] P:1663.14 E:0.083764 |  way back to the first kick you know pickers we spoke before about trying to kick it into the box
[7896.92 - 7900.60] P:1677.74 E:0.079069 |  got in the box kind of had a little knock down and did nothing come of it but I think that was just
[7900.60 - 7904.76] P:1541.03 E:0.076896 |  the statement we had from the first minute we wanted to play in their half and put balls into
[7904.76 - 7908.52] P:1627.00 E:0.076071 |  their box we wanted to press high and that's exactly what we've done they found it difficult to
[7908.52 - 7914.52] P:1468.21 E:0.084474 |  play whenever they did break we recovered quickly and then uh yeah limited them to very few chances so
[7915.64 - 7920.04] P:1578.93 E:0.076556 |  yeah overall we can be pleased with the whole week I think and then we take this into the next camp
[7920.04 - 7925.72] P:1601.46 E:0.079889 |  and I know Thomas Tuchel said on Saturday night he said to us yesterday that he felt that it was
[7925.72 - 7931.00] P:1685.96 E:0.078996 |  coming but it's all very well-saying that isn't it you've got to do it yeah I think it's just a
[7931.00 - 7935.00] P:1716.57 E:0.090928 |  feeling we've had in the camp this week I think the energy has been higher I think the level in
[7935.00 - 7941.08] P:1614.07 E:0.078210 |  training has been higher maybe the motivation as well and yeah that we we felt that we had a good
[7941.08 - 7944.76] P:1595.61 E:0.086059 |  performance a few days ago I know it wasn't the performance everyone was excited about but we
[7944.76 - 7950.04] P:1637.66 E:0.082847 |  done what we had to so we was coming into this game with maybe a little point to prove to show that
[7951.16 - 7956.36] P:1511.39 E:0.078928 |  you know we can play at the highest level and we can make it really difficult for these teams
[7956.36 - 7962.52] P:1545.04 E:0.083886 |  sure be our really good team and we made them look average tonight so yeah overall you know
[7962.52 - 7967.56] P:1703.06 E:0.081336 |  we would just got a build on this we've got a good camp a stranger camp next one with a friendly
[7967.56 - 7971.72] P:1633.36 E:0.078643 |  and then a qualifier but we'll be ready for that and we're just building now hopefully until next summer
[7971.72 - 7978.20] P:1401.79 E:0.072499 |  yeah and five matches played in the group now one or five not conceded a goal you know qualification
[7978.20 - 7982.20] P:1735.33 E:0.096939 |  looks I mean it looked to have one foot in the states already yeah sounds good when you put it
[7982.20 - 7987.88] P:1620.63 E:0.080496 |  like that for sure but yeah no that's that's what we want and you know like it's never easy to
[7987.88 - 7991.88] P:1599.90 E:0.089758 |  qualify for a major tournament sometimes we've made it look easy over the past we're making this one
[7991.88 - 7997.32] P:1540.70 E:0.078169 |  look easy but there's a lot of work that goes into it there's a lot of mindset that goes into it a
[7997.32 - 8001.64] P:1555.03 E:0.081773 |  lot of pressure playing for England and and we've all handled that really well there's a
[8001.64 - 8006.04] P:1600.44 E:0.081665 |  few new faces in the squad another couple another debut tonight for for Jed so
[8006.92 - 8010.44] P:1574.13 E:0.096010 |  another first goal scorer right next to me here and there's I'll let him have that one
[8011.88 - 8015.88] P:1678.35 E:0.076775 |  so yeah look we're we're building something and look it's not going to be perfect but you know we
[8015.88 - 8021.24] P:1468.64 E:0.072461 |  can take nights like tonight with with great spirit and use that as a good energy lovely well done Harry
[8021.64 - 8032.20] P:1752.50 E:0.067296 |  and without further ado we'll go from the man who scored tonight his 74th goal for England to a man
[8032.20 - 8039.32] P:1705.38 E:0.078623 |  who scored his first goal for England Esri Konza well done great night for you yeah excellent night um
[8040.12 - 8045.96] P:1510.74 E:0.064917 |  like I've said in in previous interviews a moment I've jumped off since I was a kid and um you know
[8045.96 - 8049.96] P:1775.98 E:0.087641 |  you always you always dream about these moments and when you're when I was young I always pictured it
[8049.96 - 8054.12] P:1523.26 E:0.077637 |  you know trying to score for England so for it to finally happen and I'm a whole family watching
[8054.12 - 8059.00] P:1404.76 E:0.081707 |  back home it was a proud moment and uh I know I'll never ever forget that's where you wanted it as
[8059.00 - 8063.80] P:1541.31 E:0.082435 |  well wasn't it you were virtually standing next to the post of course definitely um I think you know
[8063.80 - 8068.12] P:1611.56 E:0.076773 |  in set pieces especially I said in the house we have to think like the attackers like like H
[8068.12 - 8072.84] P:1460.94 E:0.080451 |  and all the them up top so you know um it's something I've been trying to work on to to try and get
[8072.84 - 8078.68] P:1532.42 E:0.086168 |  more goals so um you know to finally score today uh it was an amazing moment yeah so so even though
[8078.68 - 8083.08] P:1502.03 E:0.100847 |  I presume you've spent almost all of your career as a defender even when you're a even when you're a
[8083.08 - 8088.04] P:1523.84 E:0.078894 |  youngster yeah you you still had that dream of actually scoring for England of course one million
[8088.04 - 8092.36] P:1480.31 E:0.094414 |  percent I think that's everyone's dream especially no matter where you play I don't know about goalkeepers
[8092.36 - 8097.24] P:1391.27 E:0.078916 |  I'll forget about it goalkeepers as defenders midfield whatever wherever you play but you know
[8097.24 - 8102.36] P:1476.46 E:0.079199 |  it's everyone's dream to score for their country and um like I said a proud moment and I'll never
[8102.36 - 8108.04] P:1546.71 E:0.069809 |  forget yeah and a good feeling for you all in the dressing room to produce like that 100%
[8109.08 - 8113.08] P:1491.83 E:0.079965 |  you know we've had a great weekend camp we showed our levels in training and
[8113.08 - 8118.52] P:1562.60 E:0.077754 |  and in both games so um you know like I said look we knew if we we came into the game with
[8118.52 - 8123.32] P:1410.73 E:0.089204 |  a right mindset and the same quality that we have been putting in for the last week we knew that we
[8123.32 - 8128.04] P:1442.65 E:0.089939 |  could come here and and get a victory and that's what we did today well done Esri you'll have sweet
[8128.04 - 8134.84] P:1537.77 E:0.092023 |  dreams tonight won't you probably won't sleep thank you thank you very much Esri yeah absolutely
[8134.84 - 8139.64] P:1672.88 E:0.090304 |  delighted John wasn't he about that about scoring that that goal for England his first goal for
[8139.64 - 8146.36] P:1688.78 E:0.083905 |  for England the third of England's goals um Phil Jagielka all defenders grow up dreaming
