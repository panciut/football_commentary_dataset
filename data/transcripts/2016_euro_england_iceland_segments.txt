[0.00 - 5.60] P:1575.80 E:0.182317 |  And it is a beautiful evening here on the Côte d'Azur.
[5.60 - 9.40] P:1617.66 E:0.192258 |  From where we sit here we can actually see the hills of Nice.
[9.40 - 18.00] P:1773.60 E:0.206810 |  Lots and lots of little pastel coloured rectangular houses dotted in amongst the trees.
[18.00 - 21.00] P:1671.98 E:0.215598 |  It's a beautiful sky as well. Lovely temperature.
[21.00 - 28.00] P:1788.22 E:0.204155 |  And tonight England need to find their goal-scoring touch here on the Riviera.
[28.00 - 36.00] P:1694.84 E:0.200587 |  Against the underdogs Iceland who've reached the knockout stages of their very first major tournament.
[36.00 - 38.00] P:1599.31 E:0.174768 |  Some achievement now.
[38.00 - 45.00] P:1660.47 E:0.182476 |  But Chris Waddle on our programme just now said if England can't beat Iceland there's something wrong.
[45.00 - 50.00] P:1752.03 E:0.185590 |  So Danny Mills are they going to find their Riviera touch tonight?
[50.00 - 54.00] P:1792.09 E:0.203319 |  I'd be very, very surprised and disappointed if I don't win this game.
[54.00 - 58.00] P:1890.98 E:0.179656 |  2-0, 3-1, whether it may be.
[58.00 - 63.00] P:1834.53 E:0.163321 |  This is Iceland have done incredibly well. I'm not trying to be disrespectful.
[63.00 - 67.00] P:1820.93 E:0.164222 |  They have a very limited pool of players to pick from.
[67.00 - 71.00] P:1794.49 E:0.171990 |  They've done incredibly well to get to this stage.
[71.00 - 79.00] P:1774.55 E:0.185957 |  But if England do not win this game it will be a massive embarrassment of football and proportions.
[79.00 - 84.00] P:1800.04 E:0.190129 |  Now we've spoken a great deal this year about Euro 96 20 years ago.
[84.00 - 94.00] P:1732.63 E:0.189740 |  England have won precisely two of eight knockout ties at World Cups and European Championships since Euro 96.
[94.00 - 98.00] P:1703.68 E:0.199207 |  Danny was involved in one of them, the 3-0 against Denmark that we've mentioned.
[98.00 - 106.00] P:1848.06 E:0.202075 |  The teams tonight, Johard, Wolkak, K-Hill, Smalling and Rose, Dyer, Alli and Rooney, Sturridge, Kane and Sterling.
[106.00 - 111.00] P:1820.40 E:0.198840 |  Captain Rooney winning his 115th cap tonight which brings him level with David Beckham.
[111.00 - 119.00] P:1684.03 E:0.192757 |  Only Peter Shelton has played more times for England than Wayne Rooney who is listening to the countdown.
[119.00 - 125.00] P:1854.11 E:0.216341 |  He's jumping up and Gally Alli begins the game playing it back to Wayne Rooney.
[125.00 - 131.00] P:1842.65 E:0.184881 |  England playing from left to right in the white shirts, white shorts and red socks.
[131.00 - 142.00] P:1798.36 E:0.194036 |  He shirts with the light blue sleeves and Iceland just like Spain earlier playing the same team for the fourth consecutive match at the tournament.
[142.00 - 145.00] P:1543.28 E:0.215276 |  And the ball is out of play for a throwing to England on the half way line.
[145.00 - 155.00] P:1575.26 E:0.199530 |  And that Iceland team, Hal Dawson is the goalkeeper, back four of Saivossen, Ragnar Sigurdsson, Arnesson and Skullason.
[155.00 - 160.00] P:1573.90 E:0.203500 |  Then in midfield Goodmanson, Gunnarsson, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Pjarnasson.
[160.00 - 167.00] P:1721.63 E:0.203082 |  And he has walker down the right hand side crossing for England but it's cleared away by the captain Aaron Gunnarsson inside the penalty area.
[167.00 - 172.00] P:1745.38 E:0.170881 |  And then the two up front for Iceland, Sigthorsson and Byrd Varsson.
[172.00 - 181.00] P:1664.55 E:0.199259 |  And it is Iceland in the blue shirts, mainly blue although there is a red and white stripe down the left hand side of the front of the shirts.
[181.00 - 184.00] P:1615.63 E:0.196366 |  A little like the flag of Iceland itself.
[184.00 - 187.00] P:1712.01 E:0.203881 |  And white numbers, blue shorts and blue socks.
[187.00 - 190.00] P:1734.19 E:0.207110 |  In England with the ball at the back.
[190.00 - 192.00] P:1697.86 E:0.215135 |  Here is Kyle Walker back in the team.
[192.00 - 194.00] P:1669.47 E:0.207985 |  Six changes for England tonight.
[194.00 - 202.00] P:1678.19 E:0.197773 |  It was the team that was widely reported in the media overnight and this morning that Roy Hodgson has gone with.
[202.00 - 207.00] P:1644.84 E:0.202183 |  So here is a touch from Raheem Sterling and now Eric Geyer on the half way line.
[207.00 - 209.00] P:1605.89 E:0.210188 |  Here is Geyer swinging the ball back out to the right hand side.
[209.00 - 211.00] P:1629.87 E:0.222633 |  Sturridge is there almost with his heels on the white line.
[211.00 - 213.00] P:1815.60 E:0.201877 |  Then a flick from Ali.
[213.00 - 220.00] P:1774.05 E:0.216616 |  Sturridge 25 yards out, shooting left footed by the ball pounces wide by three or four yards of Hal Dawson's left post.
[220.00 - 223.00] P:1655.24 E:0.189410 |  Danny Mills encouraging start from England.
[223.00 - 229.00] P:1691.87 E:0.206897 |  Clearly they want to get the players wide and if Sterling comes out wide, sorry, Sturridge comes out wide and starts on the touch line.
[229.00 - 233.00] P:1448.47 E:0.194744 |  Has that touch and then goes and plays inside and follows his ball.
[233.00 - 235.00] P:1587.23 E:0.162388 |  Then that can work.
[235.00 - 244.00] P:1556.85 E:0.187885 |  This is BBC Five Live bringing you the last match in the round of 16 at Euro 2016.
[244.00 - 246.00] P:1441.13 E:0.194998 |  So this will complete the line up.
[246.00 - 250.00] P:1519.29 E:0.204364 |  We know that Italy are through having knocked out the holders of Spain.
[250.00 - 256.00] P:1767.59 E:0.216406 |  Here is Ali turning away in the centre circle and running forward and Ali manages to work into Sterling.
[256.00 - 260.00] P:1752.67 E:0.186606 |  Turns onto his left foot still going Sterling but forced wide by Cyberson.
[260.00 - 262.00] P:1758.33 E:0.185656 |  Still Sterling though, shoots.
[262.00 - 269.00] P:1728.66 E:0.185395 |  It's deflected and blocked by Cyberson and Iceland are able to clear it away to relative safety.
[269.00 - 276.00] P:1708.32 E:0.192651 |  There's a chance John, I think you know again, had he been in sparkling form and great confidence,
[276.00 - 283.00] P:1708.50 E:0.197014 |  he would have taken that shot on just a little bit of a fraction earlier and probably would have tested the goalkeeper.
[283.00 - 287.00] P:1651.95 E:0.206736 |  So it's England nil, Iceland nil.
[287.00 - 292.00] P:1613.21 E:0.206977 |  It is a pacy start from England and Gary Cahill has carried the ball a long way
[292.00 - 294.00] P:1663.41 E:0.195543 |  but runs down a playing alley in the end.
[294.00 - 296.00] P:1556.27 E:0.179466 |  However Iceland just clear it back.
[296.00 - 298.00] P:1770.24 E:0.209602 |  Sterling playing it through the middle of Sterling.
[298.00 - 303.00] P:1814.30 E:0.230128 |  Sterling could be in here, he's forced wide, all the goalkeeper comes in, catches Sterling
[303.00 - 306.00] P:1756.51 E:0.216633 |  and he's given a penalty.
[306.00 - 310.00] P:1762.91 E:0.219710 |  Sterling fouled by the goalkeeper Hal Dawson.
[310.00 - 313.00] P:1758.65 E:0.189013 |  It was a clumsy challenge by the goalkeeper
[313.00 - 318.00] P:1705.29 E:0.195446 |  and England have an early chance to get the goal to go in front in this match
[318.00 - 320.00] P:1679.70 E:0.205628 |  and it's Wayne really who's grabbed the ball.
[320.00 - 324.00] P:1597.16 E:0.194198 |  Really poor decision from the goalkeeper, one he didn't need to make.
[324.00 - 329.00] P:1705.78 E:0.204785 |  Raheem Sterling did very very well, let the ball run across him, was in on goal.
[329.00 - 331.00] P:1740.48 E:0.186082 |  The goalkeeper didn't need to come out.
[331.00 - 333.00] P:1777.57 E:0.185601 |  What was Chappell saying earlier?
[333.00 - 335.00] P:1689.12 E:0.188268 |  He's only conceded 10 of 24.
[335.00 - 339.00] P:1696.16 E:0.177659 |  That's right, he has a great record as a penalty saver.
[339.00 - 343.00] P:1633.05 E:0.176185 |  Saved 9 of his last 24 penalties in club football.
[343.00 - 348.00] P:1694.56 E:0.193841 |  But this is a golden chance for England to get the early goal that they wanted
[348.00 - 353.00] P:1706.21 E:0.191884 |  and it's the captain Wayne Rooney who's taken the responsibility with his right foot in the fourth minute.
[353.00 - 358.00] P:1858.99 E:0.192387 |  Rooney, here he comes now, strikes it low and in!
[358.00 - 361.00] P:1676.98 E:0.225374 |  The goalkeeper dived the right way down to his right
[361.00 - 365.00] P:1567.70 E:0.232371 |  but Rooney's penalty was right in the bottom corner
[365.00 - 370.00] P:1450.62 E:0.225564 |  and England have the early goal, 1-0 against Iceland.
[370.00 - 375.00] P:1448.34 E:0.217303 |  Fabulous penalty from Wayne Rooney, brilliantly struck, calm under pressure,
[375.00 - 380.00] P:1493.51 E:0.216147 |  no hesitation whatsoever and you exactly what he was going to do,
[380.00 - 384.00] P:1687.59 E:0.200382 |  drove it low into the bottom corner, really good penalty
[384.00 - 387.00] P:1701.25 E:0.202474 |  and that should ease all the nerves from England.
[387.00 - 391.00] P:1727.46 E:0.202243 |  I said earlier on it, if they get an early goal, that should see them through.
[391.00 - 393.00] P:1648.83 E:0.176987 |  They should dominate possession now,
[393.00 - 397.00] P:1690.45 E:0.182941 |  Iceland will have to come out a little bit more and that should allow more gaps for England.
[397.00 - 401.00] P:1803.64 E:0.169956 |  But you have to say, well done Raheem Sterling, first touch wasn't brilliant
[401.00 - 405.00] P:1694.52 E:0.175239 |  but he went in again for the second time, let the ball run across him,
[405.00 - 407.00] P:1682.84 E:0.181403 |  it was a really poor decision from the goalkeeper.
[407.00 - 411.00] P:1707.20 E:0.161803 |  He didn't need to come, misjudged it, once the penalty was given,
[411.00 - 414.00] P:1654.06 E:0.144741 |  Wayne Rooney fabulous, no mistake.
[414.00 - 418.00] P:1598.80 E:0.198254 |  And also Danny, I think the word of praise for Sturridge has balled through,
[418.00 - 422.00] P:1599.00 E:0.184038 |  looking for Sterling that set up the chance for him.
[423.00 - 426.00] P:1590.35 E:0.197631 |  But a clumsy challenge from the goalkeeper really.
[426.00 - 428.00] P:1692.04 E:0.193642 |  However, it's a penalty and England are in front
[428.00 - 433.00] P:1619.90 E:0.190898 |  and Wayne Rooney has just scored his 53rd goal for England extending his record.
[433.00 - 438.00] P:1719.29 E:0.214750 |  Long throw from Gunnison, he's headed on, chance to equalise it, it's in!
[438.00 - 444.00] P:1833.01 E:0.222542 |  Ragnar Sigurdsson has almost instantly equalised for Iceland.
[444.00 - 448.00] P:1771.31 E:0.216558 |  It was the long throw from Gunnison that caused the problems.
[448.00 - 452.00] P:1757.86 E:0.223024 |  There was a flick on, it fell to the central defender, Sigurdsson in the six-yard box
[452.00 - 457.00] P:1641.17 E:0.220244 |  and he made no mistake and England have pegged right back, it's 1-1 now.
[457.00 - 460.00] P:1662.91 E:0.196042 |  That's absolutely ridiculous.
[460.00 - 463.00] P:1611.32 E:0.223079 |  What did Rio Ferdinand say earlier on?
[463.00 - 468.00] P:1598.96 E:0.196206 |  You've got to have people bullying, dragging people into position.
[468.00 - 472.00] P:1675.30 E:0.205164 |  Kyle Walker goes to sleep, loses his man completely.
[472.00 - 474.00] P:1570.81 E:0.206305 |  Okay, not an awful lot Wayne Rooney can do,
[474.00 - 478.00] P:1760.74 E:0.192611 |  he gets beaten to the ball by Arnison, a big centre back for the header.
[478.00 - 486.00] P:1810.04 E:0.176709 |  But Kyle Walker goes to sleep, loses his man and it's a tap in from four yards out.
[486.00 - 490.00] P:1820.89 E:0.197181 |  You are at your most vulnerable when you've just scored.
[490.00 - 493.00] P:1838.21 E:0.174142 |  And that is terrible defending.
[493.00 - 497.00] P:1812.00 E:0.175797 |  England won, Iceland won and England were in front for,
[497.00 - 501.00] P:1787.12 E:0.168123 |  well if it was 60 seconds, I'd be surprised, Ian Dennis is behind the goal
[501.00 - 504.00] P:1830.67 E:0.164918 |  in which Iceland have just scored.
[504.00 - 507.00] P:1729.50 E:0.215245 |  Well Roy Hodgson was a move when Wayne really put England ahead
[507.00 - 511.00] P:1750.74 E:0.181878 |  but he's out now in his technical area, he's just clutch his hand as if to say,
[511.00 - 517.00] P:1736.79 E:0.161403 |  come on, but Dennis, right, the amount of space that the Icelandic player had was frightening.
[517.00 - 522.00] P:1790.05 E:0.165289 |  I was just going to say before that, John, when Raheem Sterling won the penalty,
[522.00 - 527.00] P:1719.37 E:0.182844 |  it was interesting that he went to both Daniel Sterridge and Deli Alley for a touch and support,
[527.00 - 532.00] P:1769.88 E:0.146092 |  they both brushed his hand, but of course it's all been done in a matter of seconds.
[532.00 - 541.00] P:1627.35 E:0.151252 |  So it's 1-1 and I was listening to Pema Halgrimson, one of the joint coaches of Iceland yesterday
[541.00 - 549.00] P:1672.47 E:0.164897 |  who said we've scored in almost every game from a set piece, in fact we've scored in every game.
[549.00 - 551.00] P:1750.57 E:0.143293 |  And that's still the case.
[551.00 - 554.00] P:1718.34 E:0.175803 |  And here they are now on the right-hand side with Goodmanson of Charlton,
[554.00 - 559.00] P:1719.44 E:0.178523 |  ball to the edge of the area, Pjarnasen couldn't take it on so England now bringing it away
[559.00 - 567.00] P:1672.82 E:0.179284 |  with their goal scorer tonight, Wayne Rooney, Rooney playing it back to the left-hand side to Rose,
[567.00 - 572.00] P:1742.40 E:0.181351 |  who was a little fortunate there that the ball breaks back down and he's able to play it all the way back to Joe Hart.
[572.00 - 578.00] P:1869.47 E:0.170279 |  Danny Mills, you just said the words out of my mouth John, the coach, the manager, warned England,
[578.00 - 584.00] P:1820.03 E:0.186910 |  we are good from set pieces, this is where we scored, these are where we create our opportunities.
[584.00 - 588.00] P:1701.94 E:0.172069 |  Were England not aware of this? The rest of the world were.
[588.00 - 595.00] P:1783.71 E:0.186464 |  I think they even mentioned Goodmanson's long throws yesterday and they've been completely caught out by that throw
[595.00 - 602.00] P:1769.91 E:0.159304 |  from the captain Aaron Goodmanson of Cardiff City and so 1-1 is the score.
[602.00 - 608.00] P:1780.67 E:0.182067 |  Here is Rooney on the left-hand side, a little touch from Dyer and then Rose goes for a long pass
[608.00 - 614.00] P:1786.37 E:0.181793 |  for that way beyond Harry Kane and it bounces through to the goalkeeper Hal Dorson,
[614.00 - 619.00] P:1701.55 E:0.155788 |  a magnificent turnout from Iceland, again their supporters round about 5,000 of them
[619.00 - 625.00] P:1593.43 E:0.172118 |  and they have, they've been in the ground way before the England fans, who are here in good number incidentally.
[625.00 - 632.00] P:1555.42 E:0.170012 |  I'd say there are probably twice as many England supporters inside the stadium, if not more, than Iceland fans,
[632.00 - 642.00] P:1461.11 E:0.170653 |  but they are now clapping in unison the men and women and boys and girls from that island in the north at Lankan
[642.00 - 650.00] P:1571.52 E:0.191408 |  and they'll have enjoyed that moment when the central defender Ragnar Sigurdsson scored the equaliser
[650.00 - 656.00] P:1542.92 E:0.189347 |  England with the ball at the back, slightly stung it would appear from conceding the goal,
[656.00 - 662.00] P:1641.07 E:0.191945 |  Carehill now to Sturridge, Sturridge moving in field, Sturridge playing a low ball to Sterling,
[662.00 - 667.00] P:1756.23 E:0.200524 |  Sterling centrally here, turns but he has his ankles taken away from him by Goodnison
[667.00 - 675.00] P:1668.61 E:0.165727 |  and it's a free kick, Fordon left at the centre circle, 9 minutes played and it's already 1-1.
[675.00 - 681.00] P:1685.03 E:0.175816 |  So Sterling just claims to his feet there, I think he's okay, he was just caught on the top of his right foot,
[681.00 - 690.00] P:1629.98 E:0.200474 |  Rooney is going to take the free kick, England sending Dyer up to the edge of the penalty area, Carehill is already there,
[690.00 - 697.00] P:1628.55 E:0.191135 |  Smalling hesitated but then with Iceland dropping everyone back, Smalling comes up as well,
[697.00 - 705.00] P:1758.91 E:0.183309 |  so Rooney with the delivery from the free kick, whips it in, it's headed firmly away, only back to Walker for England
[705.00 - 711.00] P:1749.81 E:0.158386 |  and Walker plays it to Rooney, Rooney on the half way line going for another long pass,
[711.00 - 717.00] P:1724.17 E:0.197745 |  here he is to the edge of the area, Dyer heads it down, bounced up, Sturridge and that meant the guilty Sigurdsson could take it away from him
[717.00 - 724.00] P:1765.44 E:0.186213 |  and whack it away down field. Back to you Dennis again, the Ben John, happy John both Roy Hodgson and Gary Neville,
[724.00 - 731.00] P:1795.69 E:0.189768 |  that free kick, desperate for Carl Walker to get out onto this near side, this right hand side to create that whip.
[732.00 - 738.00] P:1709.99 E:0.193521 |  Thanks Ian, England one, Iceland one, BBC Five Live and the ball just out of play for a throwing to England,
[738.00 - 746.00] P:1641.27 E:0.191549 |  10 yards inside, 15 yards inside the Iceland half, as England play from left to right towards the end of the stadium
[746.00 - 753.00] P:1528.22 E:0.191108 |  which is housing the Icelandic masses, Sturridge back to Carehill and now across to Smalling,
[753.00 - 760.00] P:1687.53 E:0.200105 |  Rooney's dropped very deep here and Rooney receives it from the England Central defender, is Manchester United team mate,
[760.00 - 765.00] P:1530.27 E:0.211415 |  Smalling, Rooney taking it on and then spinning a pass out here to the right hand side to Walker,
[765.00 - 771.00] P:1666.10 E:0.191001 |  Walker up against Bjarnasson, Sturridge comes for it, England keeping possession, but Iceland are very used to this,
[771.00 - 780.00] P:1700.57 E:0.174599 |  they had only 29% possession on average in the three group matches in which, let me stress again,
[780.00 - 787.00] P:1754.83 E:0.188637 |  they were unbeaten and went through just like England as group runners up, here is Dyer in the centre circle.
[787.00 - 792.00] P:1813.63 E:0.203915 |  Well possession John is no longer important is it, look at what Leicester did, I think they were average about 40% possession
[792.00 - 794.00] P:1826.09 E:0.199586 |  throughout the whole of the Premier League season.
[794.00 - 802.00] P:1764.48 E:0.177396 |  Walker moving in field goal into a congested area, it's just touched away by Sik Thorson, the tall blonde striker,
[802.00 - 807.00] P:1730.05 E:0.176316 |  but Iceland defending as a team as Sturridge plays it through into the penalty area,
[807.00 - 813.00] P:1760.25 E:0.186874 |  this time a sliding interception from Iceland's goal scorer Sigurdson, but it comes back for England,
[813.00 - 818.00] P:1694.84 E:0.211390 |  Rooney with a first time pass here to Sturridge on the right hand side, one won the score if you've just joined us on five live,
[818.00 - 827.00] P:1817.75 E:0.199425 |  here is Harry Kane, Kane plays it off, a guilty Sigurdson and it bounces behind for a corner, just being told 34 seconds between the goals,
[827.00 - 833.00] P:1757.44 E:0.199386 |  that was it, Rooney's penalty in the fifth minute, Sigurdson's equaliser in the sixth, 34 seconds,
[833.00 - 842.00] P:1691.95 E:0.185758 |  but a corner, a first corner of the game to England and with Harry Kane on the field, it is going to be Rooney who is taking the corner,
[842.00 - 850.00] P:1641.98 E:0.179014 |  well England have now got to try and do to Iceland what they did the other way round, opportunity now to put the book box,
[850.00 - 860.00] P:1659.46 E:0.188889 |  Dyer, Smalling, Cahill, Kane, strong tall players all good in the air, Rooney waiting, here's the Rooney corner into the edge of the sixth,
[860.00 - 866.00] P:1738.34 E:0.171840 |  the secure box, Smalling went for it, but missed it completely, he was unmarked in there as well,
[866.00 - 873.00] P:1700.09 E:0.172474 |  Ball played back towards Danny Rose who's the only man back for England on the halfway line and he's closed down by Bird Varson,
[873.00 - 877.00] P:1678.80 E:0.190067 |  Ball forward from Rose, he's headed out of play for a three to England on the far side,
[877.00 - 882.00] P:1696.66 E:0.171562 |  another question I'd like to ask, well we'll hold you if I have the opportunity, you know the goals are,
[882.00 - 889.00] P:1768.76 E:0.174403 |  Sigmundsson is six foot three at least, why is Kyle Walker marking in?
[889.00 - 895.00] P:1721.24 E:0.190394 |  We'll get a word from Chris Waddle as well who's watching from Paris, from our studio in Paris near the Eiffel Tower,
[895.00 - 903.00] P:1683.48 E:0.164537 |  but England with it on the halfway line, Rooney then going back to Cahill, 13 minutes played and it's one-one,
[903.00 - 909.00] P:1720.30 E:0.183865 |  England scoring the early goal that they so wanted, I mean not scored in the first half yet at Euro 2016,
[909.00 - 918.00] P:1782.07 E:0.171130 |  but then switching off for the long throw from Gunnison and equalising through Sigurdsson in the six yard box,
[918.00 - 925.00] P:1744.28 E:0.186124 |  he has Walker down the right, does Welter reach that, not sure he'll be able to keep it in, he did keep it in and gives it back to Sturridge,
[925.00 - 933.00] P:1690.36 E:0.181685 |  Sturridge turns, Bambusel's guilty Sigurdsson and now Rooney on the right hand side, Rooney, energetic performance from Rooney already,
[933.00 - 940.00] P:1691.11 E:0.164827 |  he's seen so much of the ball, this time on the right wing, gives it to Walker, Walker, it's all very congested,
[940.00 - 944.00] P:1710.89 E:0.200685 |  there are three Icelandic players there that Walker's managed to thread the ball infield towards Kane,
[944.00 - 951.00] P:1713.71 E:0.206540 |  I think he was fouled there, but referee Skamin has allowed play to continue and Harry Kane played it under the left back Skullison,
[951.00 - 956.00] P:1645.55 E:0.200601 |  I thought it might have hit Kane and gone out but no it didn't, it is cornered to England from the right hand side,
[957.00 - 964.00] P:1729.36 E:0.193447 |  the first corner from England was decent, good delivery, Cadehill didn't quite anticipate that Smalling might miss it,
[964.00 - 969.00] P:1729.67 E:0.195495 |  again this is an opportunity, England have got to make the most of these situations just like Iceland will,
[970.00 - 976.00] P:1668.26 E:0.186961 |  and all action starts at the game and a corner now to England from the right, Rooney to take it, here it is,
[976.00 - 981.00] P:1756.21 E:0.204432 |  and it, he was aiming for Cahill but it was headed up in the air, the ball's still in the box, Cahill challenges for it,
[981.00 - 986.00] P:1766.52 E:0.209655 |  weak punch by the goalkeeper, guilty sockets and clears that way on the edge of the box, comes to Alley, Alley shoots,
[986.00 - 996.00] P:1781.44 E:0.185783 |  and the ball really inches over the crossbar and over the top for a goal kick, Alley's unlucky, got closed down very very quickly,
[996.00 - 1001.00] P:1604.14 E:0.165128 |  maybe just needed it to drop another couple of inches and that would have hit the target,
[1001.00 - 1006.00] P:1664.79 E:0.174472 |  chance to bring in Chris Waddle for the first word since the start of the match, Chris.
[1006.00 - 1012.00] P:1380.99 E:0.196976 |  Yeah thanks, the pen great start, that's what you wanted, then you just think it's possession and drag them out,
[1012.00 - 1018.00] P:1319.79 E:0.194246 |  and the worst thing the world is, and I said come and cheer to the team pot, get an eight there, fan pot,
[1018.00 - 1022.00] P:1320.88 E:0.183316 |  the last score from the long throw was sort of real third man, and one of the two throwed in,
[1022.00 - 1027.00] P:1569.69 E:0.204735 |  and it's not about who's marked who, why does he get the free head on the first one, who's in front, and then the second one,
[1027.00 - 1033.00] P:1746.51 E:0.201865 |  Chris hears Sturridge inside the penalty area, lovely ball to him from Alley, Sturridge dropping his shoulder one way then the other,
[1034.00 - 1041.00] P:1678.76 E:0.174312 |  but then he was easily dispossessed by the central defender Arnason, and Iceland have it back,
[1041.00 - 1045.00] P:1582.67 E:0.188907 |  well bringing Chris again, but England on the move with Walker down the right hand side,
[1045.00 - 1050.00] P:1671.62 E:0.174309 |  Sturridge for spinning up, does well actually very tightly watched, passed forward by Walker,
[1050.00 - 1058.00] P:1682.37 E:0.173663 |  but Skulassan has it back for Iceland, and now a touch from Pjarnasen, but England back in possession inside their own heart,
[1058.00 - 1063.00] P:1712.21 E:0.198970 |  here's Rooney, Rooney just angles it back to Smalling, fourth of an hour played,
[1063.00 - 1072.00] P:1742.35 E:0.192996 |  and it's one-one after Rooney's penalty gave England the lead, but Iceland equalizing 34 seconds later, Rooney again,
[1072.00 - 1076.00] P:1692.91 E:0.193549 |  Harry Kane comes short, Deli Alley wanted the pass from Rooney, but it went short to Kane,
[1076.00 - 1080.00] P:1664.39 E:0.200645 |  Kane now to Sterling out to the area, Sterling has already won the penalty for England in this game,
[1080.00 - 1085.00] P:1651.32 E:0.186382 |  but he's dispossessed, comes back to Kane, Kane having a look, Kane having a shot,
[1085.00 - 1089.00] P:1728.85 E:0.204014 |  and the ball dips over the top of the crossbar, let's bring in Chris Waddle again.
[1089.00 - 1093.00] P:1644.67 E:0.218550 |  Yeah, just going back to the goal, the long throw, it was in front, how does he get a free header,
[1093.00 - 1096.00] P:1385.07 E:0.219738 |  and yet in Keogh walk, has gone for his hand up, it doesn't matter who you're marking,
[1096.00 - 1100.00] P:1618.83 E:0.213574 |  there he's six foot or four foot, you've got to go with him and track him, make sure you're winning the ball,
[1100.00 - 1105.00] P:1692.02 E:0.206343 |  terrible goal to go away after turning the lead, he said 34 seconds John, it's a criminal one out there,
[1105.00 - 1109.00] P:1539.76 E:0.222688 |  in a minute, dominating the play, but again not using the wits well enough for me,
[1109.00 - 1114.00] P:1566.99 E:0.210053 |  Sturridge getting Joe when he comes Wade, stay out there, Sterling's had good Joe when he's still Wade,
[1114.00 - 1116.00] P:1612.07 E:0.140892 |  stay out there.
[1116.00 - 1120.00] P:1628.88 E:0.176607 |  I think the goal has certainly rocked them, first five minutes we're looking for,
[1120.00 - 1124.00] P:1725.61 E:0.224622 |  we're hitting diagonal balls, here's Kane, scrubbing a ball into the penalty area,
[1124.00 - 1130.00] P:1511.63 E:0.201172 |  Sterling might have just been pulled back there by the central defender, Arneson,
[1130.00 - 1133.00] P:1446.76 E:0.186822 |  I don't think there was enough contact on the ballbancers through to the goalkeeper.
[1133.00 - 1138.00] P:1592.18 E:0.175067 |  No, there was, England started in the right way, you know, got the ball, got the goal from a diagonal ball
[1138.00 - 1143.00] P:1537.23 E:0.177417 |  from out wide, you know, into Raheem Sterling, and now it's like, they're a little bit shell-shocked,
[1143.00 - 1150.00] P:1751.15 E:0.212514 |  this is where they need the experience of Rooney and the more senior players to just get hold of the game,
[1150.00 - 1155.00] P:1637.50 E:0.196438 |  get back to doing what they were told to do, back to Ian Dennis behind the goal,
[1155.00 - 1161.00] P:1739.94 E:0.203628 |  the bencher agitated John, both Gary Neville and Roy Hodgson have made a point to Raheem Sterling
[1161.00 - 1167.00] P:1634.36 E:0.200845 |  to get out wide on that left, and Gary Neville saying play the ball from into out, diagonal balls out to that left and a side.
[1168.00 - 1173.00] P:1505.45 E:0.201586 |  Kane clicking the ball on the halfway line, but just giving possession back to Sigurdsson,
[1173.00 - 1178.00] P:1299.95 E:0.212479 |  Sigurdsson swings it to the left here, Sig Thorson is there, so is Dirk here,
[1178.00 - 1184.00] P:1306.77 E:0.211852 |  Djanasen with his long blonde hair, the man who scored that goal against Portugal,
[1184.00 - 1189.00] P:1463.57 E:0.200436 |  the historic first goal for Iceland at a major tournament, now it's with Gudmundsson of Charlton
[1189.00 - 1193.00] P:1683.74 E:0.237699 |  to the edge of the area, guilty Sigurdsson and Eistert, Sig Thorson's in, shoots,
[1193.00 - 1198.00] P:1782.36 E:0.251724 |  oh hard for the handkerchief, couldn't give it out and Iceland have taken the lead,
[1198.00 - 1205.00] P:1733.94 E:0.243188 |  Sig Thorson scores the goal, Hart got a big hand to that, but just took the pace of it
[1205.00 - 1212.00] P:1678.66 E:0.241876 |  and it trickled over the line into the back of the England net, and we have a big shot scoreline here
[1212.00 - 1216.00] P:1497.70 E:0.237360 |  of England one, Iceland two.
[1217.00 - 1223.00] P:1520.89 E:0.250824 |  I can't pull any punches John, the defending was absolutely appalling,
[1223.00 - 1227.00] P:1545.56 E:0.229121 |  Raheem Sterling lost his man in the first place, the ball was played out wide,
[1227.00 - 1234.00] P:1679.87 E:0.222697 |  the ball was then played inside once, twice, three times, little one-twos on the edge of the box,
[1234.00 - 1243.00] P:1712.27 E:0.205307 |  no one got close, no one got a tackle in, the side foot shot is at Johar, he has to save that,
[1243.00 - 1253.00] P:1726.97 E:0.199416 |  that's as bad as the mistake from the free kick from Gareth Bale, it was scored at the end of the stadium
[1253.00 - 1259.00] P:1669.25 E:0.198020 |  where Ian Dennis is very close to the action, didn't seem to have as much power on as the Gareth Bale
[1259.00 - 1265.00] P:1741.60 E:0.216313 |  won, Johar in front of me now still shaking his head, he actually slammed his right hand into his own head
[1265.00 - 1271.00] P:1672.87 E:0.215981 |  in annoyance, does it do the run, Harry Kane's there for you John, but we're hot on the bench,
[1271.00 - 1277.00] P:1724.16 E:0.191564 |  time being just sat down, shaking the head from Roy Hodgson, you'd expect better from Johar,
[1277.00 - 1283.00] P:1664.48 E:0.170767 |  Hart was diving down to his left, as I said at the time, got a big hand on it,
[1283.00 - 1289.00] P:1575.19 E:0.194633 |  but just really took the pace off it, well on our, when we did the Facebook Live earlier,
[1289.00 - 1294.00] P:1615.64 E:0.186224 |  it talks about does Johar need to play well, I said no, he just doesn't need to make any mistakes
[1294.00 - 1300.00] P:1703.79 E:0.179303 |  and unfortunately that has to go down as a mistake, but ultimately again, just like the first goal,
[1300.00 - 1307.00] P:1726.43 E:0.189976 |  it never ever should have got to that situation, Raheem Sterling has to get close to his man in the first place,
[1307.00 - 1314.00] P:1621.08 E:0.205576 |  the ball then comes into central area around the edge of the D and Iston play two little three yard passes,
[1314.00 - 1321.00] P:1681.70 E:0.198253 |  no one gets a touch, no one gets close enough to anybody to affect the ball, we had two great centre halves on earlier,
[1321.00 - 1328.00] P:1644.74 E:0.182098 |  Martin Kio and Rio Ferdinand, they would not have let that happen, well I think Glen weren't shell shocked before,
[1328.00 - 1335.00] P:1783.47 E:0.170554 |  they certainly are now, two one down to Iceland, here's Ali, Sturridge playing it back,
[1335.00 - 1341.00] P:1742.46 E:0.191250 |  England parked inside the Iceland half, Walkup will go back towards the half way line,
[1341.00 - 1345.00] P:1757.12 E:0.195478 |  I feel that there will have been a real tension about England before this match,
[1345.00 - 1351.00] P:1785.64 E:0.196669 |  because of the fact they were such big favourites, Gaius put in a big pressure on the half way line,
[1351.00 - 1356.00] P:1754.98 E:0.194237 |  but fortunately Smalling is able to help them out, Rooney, and then Challenge from Sterling,
[1356.00 - 1360.00] P:1699.06 E:0.202305 |  it's a foul from Gunnison, and it's a free kick to England on the left,
[1360.00 - 1366.00] P:1585.35 E:0.201013 |  it might actually have been Cyverson the right back who's just going to be spoken to by referee Scumina,
[1366.00 - 1372.00] P:1625.33 E:0.183233 |  but you know all of the worries will have begun to seep away when England won that penalty,
[1372.00 - 1379.00] P:1725.31 E:0.201464 |  when Sterling was fouled, Rooney scored it, but now, now this is a real crisis for England,
[1379.00 - 1389.00] P:1743.23 E:0.199568 |  21 minutes played, two one down, and in danger of suffering one of their biggest ever embarrassments,
[1389.00 - 1399.00] P:1769.54 E:0.185897 |  free kick on the left, it's going to be taken by Harry Kane who swings it in and it comes off the head of
[1399.00 - 1404.00] P:1737.28 E:0.198457 |  Sikthorsen, the goal scorer, over the top of his own crossbar and behind, for a corner,
[1404.00 - 1409.00] P:1687.98 E:0.189962 |  unfortunately England still have plenty of time to get back in this,
[1409.00 - 1417.00] P:1684.14 E:0.203820 |  no eyes to the very, very resolute, it would defend well, it's going to be a real uphill struggle now for England,
[1417.00 - 1424.00] P:1721.35 E:0.180843 |  corner from the right, Rooney to take base, huge Icelandic flag has been twirled behind the goal,
[1424.00 - 1429.00] P:1752.32 E:0.188727 |  Rooney, here it is, the out swinging right foot delivery, Kale with a header down,
[1429.00 - 1433.00] P:1649.59 E:0.211615 |  but it's headed away on the edge of the box and then Guilty Sigurdsson who is instrumental in the goal
[1433.00 - 1438.00] P:1785.42 E:0.200218 |  incidentally, which while it was poorly defended by England, it was beautifully worked by Iceland,
[1438.00 - 1444.00] P:1743.03 E:0.198998 |  the second goal, here's Rose playing it for it, Kale is still up there on the left hand side,
[1444.00 - 1447.00] P:1718.01 E:0.168987 |  but this controls it, Goodmunson.
[1447.00 - 1453.00] P:1770.90 E:0.216565 |  You can't let players of any international quality have a free shot from 16 yards with no pressure.
[1453.00 - 1458.00] P:1679.50 E:0.207086 |  And here is Guilty Sigurdsson, he said yesterday it would be an absolute dream to play against England
[1458.00 - 1464.00] P:1692.79 E:0.193536 |  in a tournament, that dream is turning it into a nightmare for England as the ball is cleared out of play
[1464.00 - 1471.00] P:1683.95 E:0.185693 |  for a throw to Iceland on the far side with the score England 1, Iceland 2, here's Alan Dreen to half time.
[1474.00 - 1481.00] P:1456.41 E:0.187539 |  The score line says it all doesn't it, Goodmunson with another long throw to take,
[1481.00 - 1487.00] P:1556.84 E:0.180701 |  remember his first long throw led to Iceland's equalizer, he's on the far side of the field,
[1487.00 - 1493.00] P:1512.42 E:0.209942 |  the Icelandic right, there it goes and this time it's better defended by England, by Harry Kane,
[1493.00 - 1499.00] P:1721.84 E:0.213228 |  then they're fully into the penalty here, once more, hard as made a hashamit, what a chance!
[1499.00 - 1506.00] P:1698.49 E:0.183717 |  Oh no the referee's given a free kick, well I tell you what the goal line assistant didn't react,
[1506.00 - 1512.00] P:1771.76 E:0.192182 |  neither did the assistant on the far touch line, it was the referee's Kamina who awarded a free kick,
[1512.00 - 1517.00] P:1751.92 E:0.188226 |  but really Bjarnasson, you know, heading over the crossbar ridiculous he should have hit it in.
[1517.00 - 1525.00] P:1688.80 E:0.183433 |  Well I think Johart was a little bit fortunate, clearly unsettled by that mistake for the second goal
[1525.00 - 1530.00] P:1623.20 E:0.198654 |  and Iceland did everything right, they put the ball high into the box, the looping ball back in
[1530.00 - 1537.00] P:1654.76 E:0.188685 |  and they went and challenged him, put him under pressure, he missed his punch completely,
[1537.00 - 1542.00] P:1676.34 E:0.206961 |  maybe a little bit fortunate to get a free kick, I don't think there was an awful lot in it,
[1542.00 - 1547.00] P:1724.67 E:0.165897 |  but as you said it didn't matter, the follow up shot went over the bar.
[1547.00 - 1557.00] P:1627.60 E:0.173086 |  Let's just get it right, Hart didn't get a hand on the shot, it went under his left arm, inexcusable.
[1557.00 - 1562.00] P:1628.44 E:0.203262 |  We were concerned Danny, weren't we, about England's defending before the tournament
[1562.00 - 1570.00] P:1703.02 E:0.194076 |  and now those chickens are coming under Rusnay, England won, Iceland 2, 24 minutes played here in Nice.
[1570.00 - 1576.00] P:1781.74 E:0.170024 |  It's a very old adage, you don't win anything without a great defence, you know, look at what the Italians have done,
[1576.00 - 1583.00] P:1690.70 E:0.150175 |  you know, you need a solid base to work from and maybe that is going to be England's downfall, maybe not,
[1583.00 - 1585.00] P:1756.85 E:0.184685 |  there's still time to get back in this.
[1585.00 - 1591.00] P:1740.40 E:0.193412 |  Italy were brilliant in beating Spain, the now former European champions 2-0 earlier,
[1591.00 - 1600.00] P:1745.50 E:0.175750 |  Italy will play Germany in the quarter-final, England should be thinking a place in the last eight is certain,
[1600.00 - 1607.00] P:1776.40 E:0.161574 |  that's what they must have thought before kick-off, it ain't no folks, Iceland leading by two goals to one,
[1607.00 - 1615.00] P:1790.49 E:0.168651 |  here's Kehel to the right of his own penalty area and if they were stung by the equaliser, the second Icelandic goal,
[1615.00 - 1621.00] P:1699.06 E:0.162699 |  you know, it's like a slap across both cheeks for England, now it's played down the right-hand side,
[1621.00 - 1627.00] P:1629.97 E:0.214646 |  Walker-Chasers after, I don't think he's fricking up to get there, he isn't and to great Icelandic cheers,
[1627.00 - 1631.00] P:1814.80 E:0.175628 |  it's gone behind for a goal kick, this is absolutely made for Iceland.
[1631.00 - 1637.00] P:1709.95 E:0.164415 |  England look a little bit lost at the moment, a little bit like they did against Slovakia later in that second half,
[1637.00 - 1645.00] P:1462.58 E:0.190235 |  they've lost a bit of confidence, not quite sure what to do, game plan seems to have gone out of the window about getting the ball into wide areas,
[1645.00 - 1652.00] P:1428.21 E:0.196042 |  storage on one side, Rehm Sterling's gone missing, since that first five minutes where he had two runs into the box and did well,
[1652.00 - 1659.00] P:1421.78 E:0.200050 |  we've not seen him since then, but the penalty wouldn't have happened in the first place if the goalkeeper hadn't been so rash.
[1661.00 - 1665.00] P:1630.89 E:0.215630 |  So Iceland need two-one and they're in possession with their captain Gunnarsson inside the centre-circle,
[1665.00 - 1673.00] P:1624.77 E:0.192311 |  plays it towards the right to Cyberson, the right full-back but it's beyond him, it's out of play and it's a throw-in to those in white,
[1673.00 - 1682.00] P:1699.13 E:0.188226 |  which is taken by Rose to Smalling onto Cahill just in advance of the D of the England penalty area and now Kyle Walker, the right full-back.
[1683.00 - 1691.00] P:1733.78 E:0.173420 |  Alley is up alongside Kane up front, passing his square for the moment for England, it's with the captain Rooney,
[1691.00 - 1700.00] P:1713.87 E:0.180053 |  whose penalty put England in front in the fifth minute, now Dyer onto the left-hand side and it's played on by Rose to Sterling,
[1700.00 - 1707.00] P:1702.80 E:0.192235 |  Sterling, well, I'm not going to blame him for that but it was good defending by the Icelandic full-back,
[1707.00 - 1713.00] P:1702.49 E:0.163363 |  and it was a good ball into the shin of Sterling and it went behind for a goal kick to Iceland.
[1713.00 - 1721.00] P:1597.65 E:0.153247 |  You're right not to blame Raheem Sterling, he's not being decisive at the moment and that does show a lacking confidence.
[1721.00 - 1730.00] P:1622.89 E:0.165855 |  And at this level, if you hesitate, if you give the defender an opportunity, they will make the most of it, we know how good this Icelandic defence is.
[1730.00 - 1738.00] P:1685.95 E:0.166972 |  And I think when we saw the team for the last group game and Sterling was left out, he may not play again in the tournament,
[1738.00 - 1747.00] P:1917.09 E:0.178511 |  because he's clearly shot to pieces the young man. Anyway, England are being shot to pieces, trailing Iceland by two goals to one.
[1747.00 - 1754.00] P:1670.35 E:0.170546 |  Here's the captain again, Gunnarsson with a long throw down the right touch slide and it immediately puts the England defence under pressure.
[1754.00 - 1763.00] P:1556.61 E:0.172425 |  Rose clears it though to Rooney, Rooney into Dyer and Dyer on and it's going to run to Harry Kane, the balls left for Kane by Sterling.
[1763.00 - 1772.00] P:1806.70 E:0.178498 |  Now Kane finds his club colleague, Ali, onto Sturridge, Sterling's on the far side of the post, he's come inside though, there's the cross in,
[1772.00 - 1776.00] P:1876.94 E:0.205878 |  and there's Harry Kane and the ball, he goes save with a goalkeeper, Holmerson.
[1776.00 - 1784.00] P:1910.83 E:0.185120 |  What's living to do? Great technique from Harry Kane at the far post, Sturridge did well, has to check back on his right foot,
[1784.00 - 1791.00] P:1852.12 E:0.178202 |  Kane does everything right, gets a great connection on it, unfortunately straight at the goalkeeper.
[1791.00 - 1799.00] P:1758.34 E:0.176546 |  Rooney and Sturridge are England's best players, not sure about the quality of the rest of them, nearly 28 minutes gone here in Nice,
[1799.00 - 1808.00] P:1764.05 E:0.182393 |  corner to England from the far side, Wayne Rooney to take it, right footed, swinging in towards the goalkeeper, punch clear, Ali controls it,
[1808.00 - 1814.00] P:1736.74 E:0.194599 |  then he bollies it and it's headed away once more, this time by Arnarsson, collected by Rooney again, left side of the penalty,
[1814.00 - 1822.00] P:1809.78 E:0.189977 |  deep cross, too deep for Sturridge and not surprisingly Sturridge couldn't bring the ball over the controller behind for a goal kick.
[1822.00 - 1825.00] P:1738.00 E:0.164588 |  Chris Waddley, I don't think what you're thinking at the moment.
[1825.00 - 1834.00] P:1641.83 E:0.194603 |  I agree with Ali, it's a sham, we said we couldn't defend and nobody's tested, I mean these have it really, they put two balls in the box,
[1834.00 - 1842.00] P:1624.41 E:0.196657 |  two goals, Joe Hart's got to put his hand up obviously, but I agree with him, there's only Wayne Rooney and Sturridge who look threatening,
[1842.00 - 1847.00] P:1551.09 E:0.202732 |  who are playing probably to their abilities, Sturridge is in a good position on that right hand side, holding the wits,
[1847.00 - 1850.00] P:1786.13 E:0.162999 |  Sturlin is still lacking confidence for me.
[1851.00 - 1859.00] P:1788.02 E:0.189345 |  Here's Ali, in the close-frixing but he's just sterling, almost running into sterling, Ali keeps the possession and now Sturling's available,
[1859.00 - 1865.00] P:1635.29 E:0.180764 |  Sturling takes it up, left of the penalty and he's going to run at the full back, beats him, no, checks onto his right foot,
[1865.00 - 1873.00] P:1756.42 E:0.175999 |  passes it back to Ali, Ali hasn't crossed it in, instead it's laid back once more to Wayne Rooney and Rooney to die.
[1873.00 - 1879.00] P:1804.19 E:0.192903 |  And England's body language isn't great, but here's Sturridge, Sturridge taking it up, running towards the penalty here,
[1879.00 - 1887.00] P:1776.10 E:0.202382 |  finds Sturling inside the box, Sturling plays it to Rose, Rose is crossed, takes it to the Plecton and is called by the goalkeeper, Holdersley.
[1887.00 - 1894.00] P:1859.48 E:0.195295 |  It'd be interesting to see what Chris Waddle thinks, but I think England would probably be better switching maybe to a 4-4-2,
[1894.00 - 1898.00] P:1900.66 E:0.189064 |  however they're going to do it, put Sturridge down the middle with Harry Kane,
[1898.00 - 1904.00] P:1887.36 E:0.175369 |  get somebody on this right, even put Sturling on this right-hand side and get somebody on the left at the moment.
[1904.00 - 1909.00] P:1866.33 E:0.155898 |  Sturridge looks good and he looks sharp, but you want him in the middle to create chances.
[1909.00 - 1914.00] P:1735.79 E:0.172798 |  Sturling, even when he goes past people, hasn't got the confidence on his left foot to put in the early ball
[1914.00 - 1920.00] P:1806.52 E:0.149852 |  and that means that Iceland players, defenders can get back behind, get themselves set and snuff out the chance.
[1920.00 - 1927.00] P:1728.20 E:0.149136 |  Walker, pleasure back to Cahill, onto the captain, Rooney and now Dyer, Dyer, left of the centre circle,
[1927.00 - 1932.00] P:1603.85 E:0.189550 |  running over the halfway line now into the Iceland half, flicks it forward towards Harry Kane.
[1932.00 - 1939.00] P:1739.36 E:0.193891 |  Understanding between Spurs players, he's another one, Ali, Ali goes down, but that was a dive, that wasn't a penalty kick,
[1939.00 - 1944.00] P:1695.32 E:0.208036 |  despite the holds of produce from the England fans and Iceland now on the counter-attack.
[1944.00 - 1950.00] P:1711.88 E:0.175015 |  It's with Guilfee Sigurdsson, on towards the far side of the field, doesn't get their return pass because it's out of play
[1950.00 - 1955.00] P:1743.44 E:0.192634 |  off of England boot and it's a throw into Iceland, we're just getting a replay of the challenge.
[1955.00 - 1962.00] P:1633.91 E:0.166698 |  Now, the defender wafted his foot at the ball, Ali sensed an opportunity and went down.
[1962.00 - 1966.00] P:1698.87 E:0.203491 |  My fear is this is going to be Slovakia, we visited.
[1966.00 - 1974.00] P:1784.94 E:0.193243 |  Iceland's sitting, defend deep and England just don't quite have the naus to break them down.
[1974.00 - 1980.00] P:1770.10 E:0.205360 |  Fifteen minutes to half time, Iceland leading by two goals to one, England having taken the lead.
[1980.00 - 1988.00] P:1632.68 E:0.183773 |  We all hoped for an early goal and I thought, well, one-nil could easily be transformed into three-nil, four-nil, not at all.
[1988.00 - 1991.00] P:1776.25 E:0.146883 |  Ian Dennis' touch side.
[1992.00 - 1998.00] P:1745.29 E:0.179793 |  Ian Dennis, cross, I think what they're trying to do, I've seen Gary Neville twice hold up his left hand with two fingers,
[1998.00 - 2004.00] P:1733.16 E:0.175590 |  just maybe watch for a tactical change, they're trying to get the message across and I just wonder whether they might switch to a diamond.
[2005.00 - 2011.00] P:1799.92 E:0.178807 |  Here's Sturridge, down the England right, back to Walker, the fullback and now here, Kale.
[2011.00 - 2017.00] P:1789.42 E:0.177952 |  Kale, England down to walking pace at the moment, onto Dyer and Rooney.
[2017.00 - 2024.00] P:1859.94 E:0.169180 |  It's sluggish for England, smally, inside the Icelandic half, onto Rose and now Sterling takes it up.
[2024.00 - 2030.00] P:1746.34 E:0.207406 |  Clever little dummy by Raheem Sterling, Sterling gets the ball, then he's tackled, fairly challenged, loses the ball
[2030.00 - 2034.00] P:1733.78 E:0.201349 |  and is cleared by Iceland and the Iceland fans absolutely love that.
[2034.00 - 2038.00] P:1805.66 E:0.161914 |  Sterling created an opportunity for himself, didn't make the most of it.
[2038.00 - 2041.00] P:1816.91 E:0.200094 |  Now here's Rooney, he's tackled, loses the ball.
[2041.00 - 2048.00] P:1824.45 E:0.195091 |  Gunnison plays it in for Iceland, that was a waste of pass though, on by Sterling, Kane trips on the ball and it's cleared once more.
[2048.00 - 2055.00] P:1822.45 E:0.196788 |  And it's Zigartson, good ball by Zigartson to the left side and Bjarnasen, Bjarnasen now, pretty isolated.
[2055.00 - 2067.00] P:1893.79 E:0.155334 |  Sterling just had to come back to double up with the defence, Bjarnasen feeds it in, Zigartson to the near side, Skullasen onto Bjarnasen.
[2067.00 - 2078.00] P:1777.90 E:0.175410 |  They're confident Iceland, why shouldn't they be? Having gone behind, they're leading them by two goals to one and they've no inferiority complex whatsoever.
[2078.00 - 2088.00] P:1772.23 E:0.180199 |  But that example with Sterling, exactly what I'm talking about, great little dummy to let the ball run through his legs, skin the ball back for pace, but then because it's on his left foot, he wants it to check under his hands.
[2088.00 - 2095.00] P:1774.57 E:0.178591 |  He hesitates, wants to come onto his left right foot, doesn't have the confidence to whip it in with his left foot and that gives the defender the opportunity.
[2095.00 - 2099.00] P:1817.83 E:0.167836 |  I'd get it, just give him 15 minutes on the right hand side, see what he can do.
[2099.00 - 2106.00] P:1755.59 E:0.192870 |  There's another long throw from Gunnison into the penalty area, oh, and Icelandic player went down there under a challenge by Wayne Rooney.
[2106.00 - 2114.00] P:1816.17 E:0.173911 |  Then the shot has driven in and that troubles Hart, diving to his right, but fortunately for Hart, Skullasen's effort was wider than the post.
[2114.00 - 2123.00] P:1702.19 E:0.170798 |  Oh, dearie me, you know, it did bend a little bit and Joe Hart was worried about it, I think he pulled his hands away in all fairness in the end, knew it had gone past the post.
[2123.00 - 2132.00] P:1651.59 E:0.182020 |  But again, long throw in, set pieces, causing him the massive problems and we knew this exactly what Icelandic players do.
[2132.00 - 2149.00] P:1703.04 E:0.150990 |  12 minutes to half time, you're listening to Five Live in the BBC, Dan Walker and Chris Waddle will be hosting 6-0-6 at the conclusion of this game and haven't helped us in terms of the callers we'll get if this is the final scoreline.
[2149.00 - 2161.00] P:1682.61 E:0.172264 |  Throw in to England, ball goes back to Walker, Walker plays it onto the chest of Smalling, who controls it, onto Rose, on the far side, England left, and now Sterling wants more.
[2161.00 - 2175.00] P:1619.30 E:0.189716 |  Back to Rose, Iceland set up very compactly, 4-4-2, not driven to the England right, Walker controls it well, close to the touch line, plays it back to Dyer and Dyer in to Sturridge.
[2175.00 - 2188.00] P:1533.07 E:0.178789 |  Sturridge turns away from an Icelandic player and then the fast forward wasn't great and they can bring it clear with Birdverson onto the far side and back to Arneson.
[2188.00 - 2200.00] P:1655.32 E:0.206399 |  Arneson turns and plays it back to his goalkeeper, who he might even believe that his rash challenge on Sterling that gave away the penalty so far isn't hurting Iceland too much.
[2200.00 - 2212.00] P:1688.89 E:0.187092 |  But he gives away a throw in there, England have taken it on the far side of the field, it's played back by King and here's Ali, Sturridge is right in the edge of the penalty, here's Rooney, Rooney shot was wide of goal, it was also a crack for Arneson.
[2212.00 - 2221.00] P:1747.90 E:0.171161 |  We talked about this also, I think with Martin Keown before the game and Mark Chapman, the fact that Iceland are quite happy to let people shoot from outside the box.
[2221.00 - 2236.00] P:1674.28 E:0.163040 |  It's not a huge problem, England can't get any decent possession, they're not getting round the back of the fullbacks, when they have on a couple of occasions, Sturridge down this side, check back in great boolean for Harry Kane, Sturling hasn't really got down the side.
[2236.00 - 2243.00] P:1716.96 E:0.163832 |  I think they've got to change the fullbacks, sorry the high wide players, give the Icelandic fullbacks a problem.
[2244.00 - 2255.00] P:1743.25 E:0.201202 |  Rooney putting in in front of the penalty after 5 minutes, 34 seconds later, Iceland equalised and now Rooney loses the ball and Iceland can counterattack once more.
[2255.00 - 2272.00] P:1748.08 E:0.181352 |  That wasn't a great path forward to Bredversen but he finds his colleague on the far side Sigfersen who scored the second of Iceland's goal tonight, back to Gilfrey Sigfersen, Gilfrey Sigfersen shoots a goal, it was thankfully close enough to Jew Hart who made the save comfortably.
[2272.00 - 2286.00] P:1870.50 E:0.178177 |  I'd be interested to hear what Chris thinks about this but it just seems when Iceland break, they're breaking with two or three players against five or six England players but they're in space all the time, just like they were for the second goal.
[2286.00 - 2301.00] P:1789.90 E:0.188355 |  Nobody seems to be taking responsibility to go and close those players down and mark those players and that's what Rio Ferdinand was talking about, when you're attacking you've got to make sure you're locked in, you're locked into that midfield player or centre forward that's going to come short and pick the ball up.
[2301.00 - 2315.00] P:1660.98 E:0.173513 |  England are giving Iceland an easy out at the moment. Stray pass by Wayne Rooney, he's behind Daniel Sturridge and it's out for an Iceland throw in, thankfully it's inside the Icelandic half so we're doing not have to worry about Gunnersen's long throw.
[2315.00 - 2340.00] P:1727.54 E:0.188188 |  The ball goes back to the Icelandic goalkeeper, Holerson and he hits it upfield, Smalling wins the ball in there but Sigfersen was waiting for it. Sigfersen almost put a colleague in difficulty there and he does a second occasion, put the ball to Rooney and now taken up by Harry Kane, Kane inside left channel, turns into his right foot but immediately overruns the ball, he's tackled loses it.
[2340.00 - 2354.00] P:1778.25 E:0.204720 |  Oh that's a kind free kick award by the Slovenian referee and does a yellow card, now here's a yellow card, there are seven of these Icelandic players, Guilfee Sigitsson, I don't think he's on one, no he's not, he's not.
[2354.00 - 2383.00] P:1791.43 E:0.179159 |  So that's the age of them with a possibility of being suspended for the quarterfinals, can we really be thinking this? Icelandic players being suspended for a quarterfinal, well here they are in the last 16 playing England, they're leading by two goals a while, bring in Chris Wallen just a moment, we've got seven and a half minutes left in the first half, the free kick is from the England left, Harry Kane takes it right footed, sorting it towards the far post, it was a half opportunity for Smalling,
[2384.00 - 2387.00] P:1688.76 E:0.181785 |  but it was a glancing header and it's behind for a goal kick, come in Chris.
[2414.00 - 2432.00] P:1651.32 E:0.183164 |  Here's Walker, four England on towards Ali, who's in an advanced position, the ball might yet come to the Tottenham player, but two Icelandic defenders got across quickly and one of them the captain Gunnison clears it to the half wayline, there must have been a final challenge on Gunnison because it's going to be a free kick to Iceland.
[2433.00 - 2441.00] P:1646.32 E:0.176723 |  And the problem is, if you thought Iceland had something to fight for at nil nil, you know, and they were said if they get to half time and it's nil nil, they'll start to grow in confidence.
[2441.00 - 2450.00] P:1750.99 E:0.193776 |  Now, yes, you know, they might be starting to fatigue in the second half, because the same team that has played every single game so far, but now they've really got something to hold on to.
[2450.00 - 2456.00] P:1770.12 E:0.189801 |  They are going to kick, they are going to bite and scratch and fight for every single ball.
[2457.00 - 2462.00] P:1673.50 E:0.163334 |  Iceland has the population of Leicester, just over 300,000.
[2462.00 - 2463.00] P:1791.80 E:0.191829 |  Leicester did alright though this year?
[2463.00 - 2472.00] P:1651.80 E:0.144016 |  They did okay, but this is the European Championship and it's shocking the scoreline in terms of the England perspective.
[2472.00 - 2485.00] P:1652.21 E:0.157756 |  Six minutes to half time here on five line, England one, Iceland two, throw into England, halfway inside their own half, Walker throws it straight to Skullisundalep, back for Iceland,
[2485.00 - 2495.00] P:1475.69 E:0.168808 |  who volleys it upfield, it goes out of play, kick off on Icelandic player, yes, Bortleson, but it's Sunday in England throwing as a result, Bortleson is down,
[2495.00 - 2500.00] P:1558.75 E:0.176572 |  and there are three from Slovenia, Demir Skimini just checking that the Icelandic player is okay.
[2500.00 - 2502.00] P:1531.58 E:0.217112 |  What will be the interest on collision effects?
[2502.00 - 2507.00] P:1573.59 E:0.183556 |  What will be really interesting if England do manage to make it through to the quarter-final?
[2507.00 - 2513.00] P:1687.58 E:0.160878 |  Goalkeeper, two mistakes, two costly errors.
[2513.00 - 2516.00] P:1617.65 E:0.170375 |  I think there are both bad mistakes as well.
[2516.00 - 2518.00] P:1598.42 E:0.163417 |  I think you might have to think about changing them.
[2518.00 - 2521.00] P:1581.45 E:0.141440 |  Really bad mistakes.
[2521.00 - 2532.00] P:1457.45 E:0.178899 |  Anyway, play has resumed, the Icelandic striker is okay, and here's Smalling for England, onto Rosen the far side of the field, inside the final five minutes of the first half year on five line,
[2532.00 - 2542.00] P:1446.47 E:0.159696 |  Bortleson, falls back with Smalling, and now to Cahill, and Cahill lays it towards the right side, towards Walker, and it's back to Cahill.
[2542.00 - 2551.00] P:1554.08 E:0.175024 |  And what they're looking at, England, it's just three lines of Icelandic blue shirts between them and the Icelandic penalty here,
[2551.00 - 2557.00] P:1406.82 E:0.162281 |  and at the moment they haven't got the noise to find the way forward.
[2557.00 - 2565.00] P:1534.46 E:0.189753 |  Sterling has come inside, Rose is wide on the left and the far side of the field, and Rose takes it up from Rudi's pass, onto Sterling,
[2565.00 - 2574.00] P:1681.69 E:0.177548 |  Rose is after it, the ball might bounce kindly for Danny Rose, then he was challenged, but it was just a physical challenge, it wasn't a foul, and it's behind for the goal kick.
[2574.00 - 2583.00] P:1804.51 E:0.166535 |  Now for those that haven't seen Iceland play either live or on the television, it's a little bit like watching Stoke or West Brom under Tony Pulas.
[2583.00 - 2590.00] P:1618.32 E:0.164553 |  Very, very organised, rigid 4-4-2, happy to play from set pieces, and it's effective.
[2590.00 - 2597.00] P:1652.06 E:0.164983 |  But you know what gets me when you say that, and you're absolutely right Danny, could Roy Hodgson not see this?
[2597.00 - 2602.00] P:1696.25 E:0.180959 |  How high with his resources can he not think of a way past Iceland?
[2602.00 - 2608.00] P:1562.66 E:0.161343 |  Well, Iceland even told us their strengths, they were quite happy to brag about it as well.
[2608.00 - 2614.00] P:1668.94 E:0.188935 |  Ziggerson, that's Guilfee Ziggerson, plays it back into his own half, and Cyberson hits it forward, it's now inside the centre circle.
[2614.00 - 2623.00] P:1495.80 E:0.191210 |  Cyberson now bollies it again, towards the left side, but that's well beyond Bjarnasson, and it just doesn't really matter how scrappy Iceland's football is at the moment,
[2623.00 - 2630.00] P:1556.48 E:0.207347 |  they're leading by two goals to one, and we're inside the 42nd minute of the game.
[2630.00 - 2635.00] P:1732.52 E:0.204077 |  What thinking needs to be done in that England dressing room at half time?
[2635.00 - 2641.00] P:1905.21 E:0.207676 |  Smalling to Rose, how much better will feel if England can equalise before the interval?
[2641.00 - 2645.00] P:1671.45 E:0.155457 |  There's still plenty of time, but they're not playing well enough at the moment.
[2645.00 - 2653.00] P:1661.85 E:0.167169 |  Rose on the far side of the field, Dummies Goodman sin and brings the ball under control, now he hits it through the centre circle to Kehl,
[2653.00 - 2662.00] P:1766.38 E:0.174982 |  Rooney's available, Rooney takes it up, just over the half way line, and Rooney slides the pass towards the left, towards Rose,
[2662.00 - 2670.00] P:1776.41 E:0.157688 |  Sterling's ahead of him, but there's not really an option for the passes infield instead to Smalling,
[2670.00 - 2676.00] P:1770.56 E:0.185841 |  and as to Kehl, he's made 20 yards progress inside the Icelandic half, leaving it for Sturridge,
[2676.00 - 2683.00] P:1752.96 E:0.181222 |  and Sturridge crosses towards the par-po, and that almost pulled the goalkeeper, it turned out to be as much of a shot as it was across,
[2683.00 - 2686.00] P:1744.03 E:0.122973 |  but Holerson caught it in time.
[2687.00 - 2698.00] P:1645.59 E:0.165837 |  Stravakia, like I said, revisit isn't it? You know England now, not quite sure what to do, can't get the ball with any real threat in the final third,
[2698.00 - 2704.00] P:1708.89 E:0.183480 |  and since that second goal went in, far from that shot from Harry Kane, haven't really troubled the goalkeeper in any way, shape or form.
[2704.00 - 2710.00] P:1735.26 E:0.176466 |  No, I think clearly the damage is obvious to England's confidence,
[2710.00 - 2717.00] P:1690.55 E:0.189036 |  when they should have been thriving courtesy of this man's early penalty, Wayne Rooney, Rooney's now being fouled.
[2717.00 - 2725.00] P:1715.58 E:0.164180 |  Gunnerson, his opposite number, the Icelandic skipper has fallen, just a couple yards in advance of the centre-circle,
[2725.00 - 2731.00] P:1779.18 E:0.162172 |  so Rooney takes the free kick to Rose, onto Sterling, on the far side of the field, Ali's gone across,
[2731.00 - 2738.00] P:1761.28 E:0.178405 |  Sterling wholly unconvincing with the possession of the ball there, England fortunate to keep possession,
[2738.00 - 2747.00] P:1680.18 E:0.165096 |  it's with Cahill, onto Rooney, back to Dyer, and there isn't an Icelandic player within 30 yards of the half-wayline at the moment,
[2747.00 - 2753.00] P:1673.92 E:0.188856 |  Walker takes on his opposite number on the outside, plays it into Rooney, Rooney hits it on the ball,
[2753.00 - 2756.00] P:1617.43 E:0.214328 |  he down into the grind, and wide of the goal was shot.
[2756.00 - 2763.00] P:1769.00 E:0.187159 |  The difficult one for Rooney, it was driven in by Kyle Walker, really, really fiercely, came to Wayne Rooney quite quickly,
[2763.00 - 2768.00] P:1848.57 E:0.154006 |  misjudged it by a fraction, and instead of getting his foot on the ball, got his shin on the ball,
[2768.00 - 2774.00] P:1679.15 E:0.181877 |  we just see a picture of Roy Hodgson with head in hand, rubbing his eyes, quite sure what to do.
[2774.00 - 2781.00] P:1568.88 E:0.172909 |  I think he's got a brave call at half-time, and if he takes off for him, Sterling kills his confidence completely,
[2781.00 - 2785.00] P:1547.80 E:0.155723 |  but you've got to do the right thing for England, and to get back and win this game.
[2785.00 - 2791.00] P:1493.90 E:0.175017 |  Well, here we are in the final minute of the first half, and to repeat what is obvious out there,
[2791.00 - 2797.00] P:1836.22 E:0.188752 |  England have two players playing the form tonight, Rooney and Sterling, nobody else.
[2797.00 - 2801.00] P:1826.67 E:0.151572 |  Iceland have a free kick, just short of the half-wayline.
[2801.00 - 2807.00] P:1743.87 E:0.180725 |  Harry Kane's done OK when he's had the ball in decent areas, there's a couple of shots that haven't been too far away,
[2807.00 - 2810.00] P:1817.71 E:0.171546 |  but again, he's had real limited service.
[2810.00 - 2815.00] P:1830.05 E:0.146921 |  So here's a free kick, which Arneson, the central defender, is going to take.
[2815.00 - 2820.00] P:1738.20 E:0.167631 |  Arneson of Malmo plays it right footy, deep towards this near side of the field,
[2820.00 - 2825.00] P:1623.34 E:0.176894 |  and Walker rises quickly in glances ahead of her to play, waiting for the fourth official.
[2825.00 - 2828.00] P:1766.33 E:0.182366 |  I don't think there is any added time, there isn't.
[2828.00 - 2833.00] P:1889.56 E:0.198848 |  And that first half, from an England perspective, was absolutely pathetic.
[2833.00 - 2838.00] P:1886.42 E:0.207990 |  I couldn't quite work out whether there was a few years or not that then turned into sort of applause,
[2838.00 - 2841.00] P:1930.65 E:0.179166 |  trying to get the team going, incredibly disappointed.
[2841.00 - 2845.00] P:1925.60 E:0.166225 |  Great start, Reem Sterling for five minutes, you thought,
[2845.00 - 2850.00] P:1868.32 E:0.173193 |  yeah, OK, he's got a little bit of confidence, he wants to make runs into the area.
[2850.00 - 2855.00] P:1790.73 E:0.159104 |  A poorly defending for the first goal, just as bad defending,
[2855.00 - 2861.00] P:1760.22 E:0.166553 |  and then a real poor mistake from Johar for the second, and England now are right up against it.
[2861.00 - 2865.00] P:1777.44 E:0.168318 |  It really hurts to say this, England won Iceland 2.
[2865.00 - 2870.00] P:1594.13 E:0.160997 |  England are 45 minutes away from an ignominious defeat.
[2870.00 - 2875.00] P:1567.89 E:0.178757 |  England's team now, Johart, Wolcott, Cahill, Smalling and Rose,
[2875.00 - 2880.00] P:1470.65 E:0.202903 |  then Wilshire with Allian Rooney, I decide, Sturridge, Sterling and Kane.
[2880.00 - 2886.00] P:1355.80 E:0.201686 |  Iceland as they started the match, Haldorsson, their goalkeeper, Saivarsson, Ragnarsigarsson,
[2886.00 - 2892.00] P:1381.34 E:0.190035 |  Arneson and Skullarsson the back four, Gudmundsson, Gunnarsson, Guilfysigarsson,
[2892.00 - 2899.00] P:1578.06 E:0.174607 |  and Birkjärn Gjarnarsson with Colben, Sigthorsson and John Daddy, Börd Varsson up front.
[2899.00 - 2904.00] P:1764.14 E:0.176077 |  England, if you've just joined us, what a night so far.
[2904.00 - 2910.00] P:1634.27 E:0.183469 |  England scoring early in the fifth minute, a Rooney penalty that was won by Raheem Sterling,
[2910.00 - 2916.00] P:1507.63 E:0.192682 |  but Iceland equalising 34 seconds later from after a long throw, Ragnarsigarsson with that one,
[2916.00 - 2922.00] P:1503.35 E:0.157555 |  and then Colben, Sigthorsson with a shot, that Johart dived to his left,
[2922.00 - 2926.00] P:1499.14 E:0.158857 |  got a hand too, but was unable to keep out of the net.
[2926.00 - 2931.00] P:1605.98 E:0.178858 |  Here is Wilshire then, straight into the action, playing it forward towards the edge of the box,
[2931.00 - 2939.00] P:1586.39 E:0.171205 |  and across comes central defender Sigthorsson and puts it out of play, throwing to England down the left.
[2939.00 - 2947.00] P:1535.47 E:0.175839 |  Don't take me home, the England supporters are singing, well that is the prospect that is facing them.
[2947.00 - 2952.00] P:1612.69 E:0.197838 |  Here's Wilshire, Kane, Rooney now, Rooney picks out Sturridge on the right corner of the box,
[2952.00 - 2957.00] P:1589.80 E:0.187742 |  Sturridge has Walker on the overlap, Sturridge still comes inside, gives it back to Rooney,
[2957.00 - 2965.00] P:1638.36 E:0.174658 |  Rooney then dinks it in, Alley back, only half headed away by Sigthorsson, comes out and is cleared away,
[2965.00 - 2972.00] P:1458.65 E:0.169636 |  and then smalling wins ahead, but that's whacked away downfield by Sigthorsson the right back.
[2972.00 - 2978.00] P:1587.99 E:0.169454 |  Flidlite's brightly on now here in Nice, and Jack Wilshire having replaced Eric Dyer,
[2978.00 - 2983.00] P:1605.63 E:0.194387 |  Rooney hitting a pass that Sturridge really had no chance, did well, did half control it,
[2983.00 - 2987.00] P:1709.09 E:0.200182 |  and then Sturridge slides in with a challenge and concedes a free kick.
[2987.00 - 2994.00] P:1660.36 E:0.197935 |  And actually, Daniel Scamina might be pulling out a yellow card for that, he does for the challenge on the left back school lesson.
[2994.00 - 2998.00] P:1709.27 E:0.189936 |  Danny Mills had to be a yellow card, Sturridge just let the ball slip away for a minute,
[2998.00 - 3005.00] P:1595.61 E:0.190658 |  and he's eagerness to try and win it back, just dived in from behind, that's always going to be a yellow card.
[3005.00 - 3011.00] P:1649.37 E:0.167137 |  England, they've got to come up with something different, you know, the difference at the moment is,
[3011.00 - 3017.00] P:1430.07 E:0.195282 |  the Icelandic defence are comfortable in what they do, they're organised, they don't panic,
[3017.00 - 3024.00] P:1677.74 E:0.154103 |  they just get on with their job, they're not phased or flustered by any England changes.
[3024.00 - 3033.00] P:1749.67 E:0.161027 |  Iceland playing at the other top, down the right for Sigthorsson, who is challenged by a Rose
[3033.00 - 3042.00] P:1733.12 E:0.154326 |  and it deflects out of play for another long throw, and here he comes, the captain, Aaron Gunnison of Cardiff City
[3042.00 - 3048.00] P:1662.91 E:0.181819 |  with his bristling Icelandic beard and takes the throw to the edge of the penalty area,
[3048.00 - 3054.00] P:1700.10 E:0.167105 |  England trying to close down Guilfee-Sigertson, Wilshire just about got there and blocked it away to the halfway line,
[3054.00 - 3059.00] P:1565.97 E:0.180490 |  but Guilfee-Sigertson totally unmarked 25 yards out, England fearing the long throw.
[3059.00 - 3063.00] P:1510.96 E:0.170809 |  Then a long pass from the back from Sigthorsson, it's only half headed away,
[3063.00 - 3069.00] P:1680.44 E:0.166125 |  headed away further by Walker and the ball bounces out of play, 10 yards inside the England half.
[3069.00 - 3080.00] P:1627.56 E:0.153726 |  So it's 2-1, the scoreline, England 1, Iceland 2, and with that scoreline, it would be France against Iceland
[3080.00 - 3085.00] P:1646.05 E:0.156162 |  in the quarter-final and England would be going home.
[3085.00 - 3090.00] P:1681.87 E:0.202649 |  Smalling, who would, in strid over the top of Smalling's head, there's a repealed for an offside decision
[3090.00 - 3095.00] P:1612.07 E:0.167463 |  which is given against Johan Gunnison on the edge of the box, so free kick to England.
[3095.00 - 3100.00] P:1498.49 E:0.162016 |  He almost started the second half, particularly convincingly, and this is the problem.
[3100.00 - 3104.00] P:1729.06 E:0.174672 |  What has Roy Hodgson said to those players at half-time?
[3104.00 - 3111.00] P:1723.39 E:0.189357 |  He must have given them clear instructions, he made a substitution, he must, he has to have given them a game plan.
[3111.00 - 3116.00] P:1686.24 E:0.166771 |  He said, right, this is what you have to go out and do, this is how I want you to start.
[3116.00 - 3122.00] P:1593.33 E:0.162122 |  So either Roy Hodgson's given them the wrong information or the players aren't doing what he's told them.
[3122.00 - 3129.00] P:1696.85 E:0.161146 |  England, playing from right to left, ruining, stretching for it, finds Rose, Rose now on the left-hand side,
[3129.00 - 3135.00] P:1679.50 E:0.190840 |  Rose making good ground down the left and then is bundled over by Johan Gunnison, and it's a free kick.
[3135.00 - 3139.00] P:1481.11 E:0.185996 |  Johan Gunnison is one of those players, almost the whole Icelandic team,
[3139.00 - 3144.00] P:1548.76 E:0.190768 |  on one yellow card away from missing the quarter-final, and it's only a free kick.
[3144.00 - 3150.00] P:1750.94 E:0.201343 |  So a chance for a set piece, the team's in the second half, attacking towards the bulk of their supporters.
[3150.00 - 3157.00] P:1671.26 E:0.196534 |  So many red and white England flags behind the goal that is being defended by Hannes Haldorsson,
[3157.00 - 3162.00] P:1692.29 E:0.185936 |  and he is lining up his two-man wall, this is from an angle on the left.
[3162.00 - 3167.00] P:1656.83 E:0.180603 |  Kane is going to take the set piece with his right foot, Kane waits for the whistle.
[3167.00 - 3173.00] P:1680.43 E:0.193832 |  Here he comes then, swirls it into the edge of the six-yard box and it is headed away, out to the far side,
[3173.00 - 3180.00] P:1684.48 E:0.176342 |  Willshaw will actually just keep it in over there, and now plays a left-footed high ball, a raking pass,
[3180.00 - 3187.00] P:1779.31 E:0.174996 |  Kane wins the header and heads it down into the six-yard box where goalkeeper Haldorsson just drops on it.
[3187.00 - 3194.00] P:1704.78 E:0.164616 |  But the difference again, when that ball was cleared, the two Icelandic centre-backs were pointing and shouting.
[3194.00 - 3200.00] P:1696.73 E:0.178166 |  Hanneson and Sigurdsson were saying, right, you get in here, you mark him, do your job, get back in,
[3200.00 - 3205.00] P:1458.33 E:0.164045 |  and when the second ball comes back in, we defend it properly. That's what England didn't do,
[3205.00 - 3208.00] P:1568.59 E:0.181840 |  and that's why as a defender you don't have to always be the greatest player,
[3208.00 - 3211.00] P:1385.38 E:0.189667 |  but you need to be a commanding and a good organiser.
[3211.00 - 3215.00] P:1557.00 E:0.162915 |  Lars Lagerbeck, the joint coach who was saying yesterday,
[3215.00 - 3221.00] P:1573.49 E:0.168514 |  the strength of this Icelandic team is the fact that they're such a strong group of friends really,
[3221.00 - 3229.00] P:1596.90 E:0.155291 |  and he said that they've played together for years and years, and you can see that spirit, which is writ large,
[3229.00 - 3234.00] P:1651.62 E:0.173648 |  and here's their star man, Guilfee Sigurdsson, who was involved in the build-up to the second Icelandic goal,
[3234.00 - 3241.00] P:1666.08 E:0.168643 |  and he's crossing now, but it's over the top of Goodmanson, and it will just run out of play for a throw into England in their own left-back position.
[3241.00 - 3249.00] P:1807.60 E:0.175257 |  2-1 to Iceland, yep, if you just switched on, 2-1 to Iceland. England are heading out unless they can produce something dramatic.
[3249.00 - 3251.00] P:1807.87 E:0.183334 |  Chris Waddle's listening back in Paris.
[3251.00 - 3254.00] P:1504.70 E:0.220827 |  Yeah, not a lot of improvement, not a lot of difference to the passing,
[3254.00 - 3261.00] P:1372.65 E:0.190600 |  the tempo's been alright really through the game, but the movement, and set pieces, really, John is just breaking it,
[3261.00 - 3263.00] P:1521.76 E:0.202284 |  but set pieces, nobody makes a ball.
[3263.00 - 3267.00] P:1628.29 E:0.205605 |  Sterling gets a fortunate bounce to the ball, Chris Sterling then hits Goodnison with his pass in field.
[3267.00 - 3275.00] P:1704.23 E:0.168294 |  It's back to Wilshire, come back for Chris in a moment, Wilshire to his right, to Rooney, Rooney now, clips the pass towards Sturridge,
[3275.00 - 3280.00] P:1744.83 E:0.197088 |  or it bounces up awkwardly and hits him on the arm, no free kick given for Han Ball, he's fortunate there.
[3280.00 - 3285.00] P:1678.66 E:0.149885 |  Sturridge and England, walker now down the right, up against Bjarne-sson,
[3285.00 - 3289.00] P:1710.98 E:0.177211 |  then back onto his left side and plays it back to Rooney behind him.
[3289.00 - 3294.00] P:1728.63 E:0.213840 |  Rooney, always keeping it away, passes it straight to Sigurdsson, and Iceland have got the ball back,
[3294.00 - 3299.00] P:1753.65 E:0.181425 |  and will look to a counter-attack here through left-back Skullersson, and then they give it away,
[3299.00 - 3302.00] P:1737.74 E:0.182365 |  and Sterling is fouled in centre-field.
[3302.00 - 3308.00] P:1648.73 E:0.173502 |  I think England are going to look to take a quick free-kick here, but Wilshire, rather cannelly,
[3308.00 - 3312.00] P:1445.48 E:0.156558 |  Syversson ran across him, so wasn't able to do that.
[3312.00 - 3317.00] P:1578.06 E:0.160636 |  England need to move the ball more quickly, that was another message that we had before the game,
[3317.00 - 3320.00] P:1610.50 E:0.175678 |  and they're simply not doing that at the start of the second half.
[3320.00 - 3325.00] P:1737.95 E:0.179099 |  Cahill, too small, and now Wilshire, deep-line position,
[3325.00 - 3331.00] P:1713.38 E:0.206406 |  Wilshire curling it through, Ali with a run, but it bounces through to go keep a hal dorsum.
[3331.00 - 3333.00] P:1713.21 E:0.222468 |  So back to Chris Waddle again.
[3333.00 - 3338.00] P:1672.96 E:0.205514 |  As you're saying, set pieces, it's strength of Iceland, every ball coming in the box they deal with quite comfortably.
[3338.00 - 3342.00] P:1492.72 E:0.225993 |  So why don't England have a bit of imagination, move the ball, try and move people around a bit,
[3342.00 - 3345.00] P:1388.03 E:0.199352 |  then put the ball in the box, they make it a bit more movement,
[3345.00 - 3349.00] P:1294.81 E:0.214106 |  they dominate and every ball goes into the box, but we just keep putting the ball in there,
[3349.00 - 3350.00] P:1629.22 E:0.161142 |  it's very easy for them.
[3350.00 - 3354.00] P:1628.76 E:0.203017 |  Equally, Chris, I'm not convinced that England will keep a clean sheet if they give away set pieces.
[3354.00 - 3358.00] P:1545.26 E:0.204619 |  If you're honest, and now Megan Graham down the left-hand side, looks to the left-back,
[3358.00 - 3362.00] P:1727.82 E:0.182338 |  Skullisen, and Skullisen, I'm not sure he was able to keep that in, he wasn't before he put it back.
[3362.00 - 3364.00] P:1715.52 E:0.153732 |  So it's a gold kick to England.
[3364.00 - 3370.00] P:1812.88 E:0.178936 |  Five-live, BBC Five-live, here in Nice, where it is 2-1 to Iceland,
[3370.00 - 3373.00] P:1617.80 E:0.162828 |  and we're already eight minutes into the second half.
[3373.00 - 3378.00] P:1629.70 E:0.181952 |  It's dark now, we can see the twinkling orange lights on the hills above the stadium.
[3378.00 - 3383.00] P:1707.01 E:0.181937 |  The quarter-finals begin on Thursday, along the court, there's Juer in Marseille,
[3383.00 - 3388.00] P:1606.01 E:0.157241 |  and with this scoreline, it'll be Iceland who are in the last aid, not England.
[3388.00 - 3393.00] P:1646.30 E:0.162186 |  Problem at the minute, John, the last two attempts, England going forward,
[3393.00 - 3399.00] P:1732.42 E:0.187321 |  and even now, players are having two, three touches every single time before they release the ball.
[3399.00 - 3403.00] P:1648.08 E:0.165522 |  And that means those Icelandic players, that buys them time,
[3403.00 - 3405.00] P:1572.90 E:0.176485 |  and they can get organised behind the ball.
[3405.00 - 3411.00] P:1689.06 E:0.171402 |  England have got to start popping it off, one and two touch, max, to move those players out of the way.
[3411.00 - 3414.00] P:1705.70 E:0.189594 |  Well, Wilshire's caught in possession, Sigurdsson tries to win a throw-in,
[3414.00 - 3419.00] P:1846.81 E:0.174286 |  and then Smalling has to come to the rescue and tackle it out of play for a throw-in.
[3419.00 - 3424.00] P:1677.30 E:0.155369 |  There's no-one in the Iceland coaching area, even though they've got two coaches, it's completely absent.
[3424.00 - 3429.00] P:1598.36 E:0.196070 |  They don't need two jobs, they know their jobs, it's working well, they're organised,
[3429.00 - 3433.00] P:1622.66 E:0.170858 |  the coach is just happy to sit back and say, look, I've told you what to do, go out and do it.
[3433.00 - 3438.00] P:1377.21 E:0.132845 |  The Icelandic supporters are having an absolute ball here.
[3438.00 - 3442.00] P:1519.86 E:0.216955 |  They're going to be heroes, these players are going to be heroes.
[3442.00 - 3443.00] P:1424.04 E:0.205881 |  They're already heroes, that means.
[3443.00 - 3444.00] P:1699.38 E:0.198286 |  Exactly, no matter what happens.
[3444.00 - 3448.00] P:1498.97 E:0.206059 |  Gunnison, with a long throw into the England penalty area, comes off ahead of Smalling,
[3448.00 - 3452.00] P:1750.93 E:0.186166 |  Sigthorsson putting them under pressure, corner to Iceland from the right,
[3452.00 - 3458.00] P:1599.50 E:0.185071 |  remember, they're very useful from set pieces, more than useful, John, they cause all sorts of problems.
[3458.00 - 3464.00] P:1537.47 E:0.193271 |  Smalling was pulling the shirt, you know, of Sigthorsson there, we've just seen the replay.
[3464.00 - 3468.00] P:1760.91 E:0.178143 |  Just Smalling, who's been pulled up for that in the past.
[3468.00 - 3470.00] P:1806.34 E:0.201303 |  That was in the penalty area.
[3470.00 - 3474.00] P:1830.29 E:0.183930 |  Here's the corner then, deep, deep corner, Gunnison going for the header,
[3474.00 - 3479.00] P:1776.15 E:0.226322 |  heads it back across the box, Sigthorsson with header, an overhead kick, it hits Johardt, who's blocked it away.
[3479.00 - 3484.00] P:1763.98 E:0.178246 |  Well, England were fortunate there, the overhead kick, that could have gone anywhere,
[3484.00 - 3489.00] P:1738.49 E:0.184098 |  either side of Johardt, and it was in the net, and it was Ragnar Sigthorsson again,
[3489.00 - 3492.00] P:1557.94 E:0.204998 |  the central defender, who very nearly scored his second goal of the game.
[3492.00 - 3495.00] P:1691.44 E:0.128873 |  Lucky, lucky England.
[3495.00 - 3501.00] P:1777.98 E:0.155922 |  The overhead kick from the centre-back goes straight at Johardt, and it hits him, rather makes sense.
[3501.00 - 3507.00] P:1741.56 E:0.185868 |  But again, there's two free headers, ball comes into the box, two players at the far post were completely unmarked,
[3507.00 - 3512.00] P:1790.10 E:0.182590 |  comes back across, Karl Walker gets out, jumped again, and it leaves another chance.
[3512.00 - 3515.00] P:1773.87 E:0.157769 |  Just got a defend properly.
[3515.00 - 3518.00] P:1714.40 E:0.192343 |  Back down to behind the goal at the other end, Ian Dennis.
[3518.00 - 3522.00] P:1718.56 E:0.208595 |  Three for the substitutes, were already celebrating in their purple bibs, they'd run off the bench,
[3522.00 - 3525.00] P:1747.31 E:0.180297 |  and then quickly had to retreat after that heart save.
[3525.00 - 3528.00] P:1724.93 E:0.171063 |  Long throw from Gunnison, here it is into the England penalty area,
[3528.00 - 3534.00] P:1668.20 E:0.146059 |  Smalling comes, get the header away, Stirling heads it further on, and Alley, his header clear,
[3534.00 - 3540.00] P:1666.62 E:0.145992 |  Gunnison wins it, Rooney, it's so frantic and congested.
[3540.00 - 3547.00] P:1673.57 E:0.158173 |  Iceland are winning 2-1, still so much time in the game to play, still 35 minutes to go.
[3547.00 - 3552.00] P:1641.37 E:0.165879 |  But the feel of the tempo of the game at the moment is almost last five minutes stuff.
[3552.00 - 3555.00] P:1623.32 E:0.169350 |  And that'll be because, John, of what happened against Favakia,
[3555.00 - 3560.00] P:1718.80 E:0.170187 |  they had all that time to create chances, make opportunities, and they didn't.
[3560.00 - 3566.00] P:1708.94 E:0.188805 |  Back heel down the line, Burt Walker isn't able to run onto it, and it's out of play for a throw in.
[3566.00 - 3570.00] P:1785.78 E:0.144079 |  And Iceland have that throw halfway inside their own half.
[3570.00 - 3576.00] P:1680.55 E:0.153673 |  Alarm bells are ringing loudly, this is not looking good for England.
[3579.00 - 3583.00] P:1480.20 E:0.187785 |  Throw in, that Skullisen is going to take.
[3583.00 - 3590.00] P:1564.83 E:0.210460 |  And then a care-heal and walk together, there's a breakdown of communications between those two,
[3590.00 - 3596.00] P:1508.26 E:0.170391 |  Kale heads in into the back of Walker, and England need a moment of magic here,
[3596.00 - 3601.00] P:1511.84 E:0.200007 |  they need a moment of inspiration that's out of keeping with what we are seeing, what we're watching.
[3601.00 - 3607.00] P:1543.46 E:0.159952 |  They haven't troubled the goalkeeper at all in this second half, they haven't created an opportunity yet.
[3607.00 - 3614.00] P:1623.89 E:0.142861 |  Dianasen plays it forward to Sig Thorsen, the ball bounces off him and out of play for a throw into England,
[3614.00 - 3616.00] P:1605.30 E:0.184558 |  level with the edge of their own penalty area.
[3617.00 - 3619.00] P:1800.42 E:0.126741 |  Walker waiting to take it.
[3619.00 - 3626.00] P:1659.94 E:0.172526 |  Has a little bit of an air of the 1990 World Cup game that Chris Waddle was involved in against Cameroon.
[3628.00 - 3632.00] P:1726.06 E:0.187090 |  Tournament novices playing against England gave him a massive shock,
[3632.00 - 3635.00] P:1743.93 E:0.162227 |  and England only got through that one in extra time.
[3636.00 - 3638.00] P:1902.67 E:0.145873 |  Here is Smollett.
[3638.00 - 3643.00] P:1800.86 E:0.172596 |  Rose hits a long pass, Kane now tries to slip it forward, Stirling on the chase,
[3643.00 - 3647.00] P:1565.69 E:0.191336 |  but Syverson plays it back to goalkeeper Halderson, who rather slices it.
[3647.00 - 3649.00] P:1378.20 E:0.192761 |  We talked about his kicking, didn't we, before the game?
[3649.00 - 3653.00] P:1822.49 E:0.157917 |  Kane does well against two Icelandic defenders,
[3653.00 - 3657.00] P:1647.63 E:0.173174 |  Rooney now, middle of the Iceland half to Sturridge on the right-hand side.
[3657.00 - 3662.00] P:1675.73 E:0.152771 |  Walker is there, Walker, but the pace has dropped the game, back to Sturridge.
[3662.00 - 3667.00] P:1801.62 E:0.165019 |  Sturridge, closed down by Sig Thorsen, Walker once more, Walker plays it in,
[3667.00 - 3671.00] P:1735.43 E:0.203736 |  but hits the first defender, Skullersen, he's able to clear the way out of play easily.
[3672.00 - 3678.00] P:1882.73 E:0.168784 |  England like mannequins in the middle of the park, all stood in the box, just watching.
[3678.00 - 3683.00] P:1754.26 E:0.195763 |  No one making any movement, no one dropping deep, and that's, you've got to move the ball quickly.
[3683.00 - 3689.00] P:1801.15 E:0.189296 |  One-two touch, side to side, backwards and forwards, move these Icelandic defenders.
[3689.00 - 3694.00] P:1724.73 E:0.162417 |  Referee Skamina just took a moment there to speak to Wayne Rooney and Guilfrey Sigertsen.
[3695.00 - 3697.00] P:1587.92 E:0.121584 |  Not sure what that was about. Throw in that.
[3697.00 - 3699.00] P:1674.60 E:0.200986 |  England are going to try a long throw from Walker.
[3699.00 - 3704.00] P:1704.12 E:0.151757 |  Cale tries to flick it on, but it's headed away by Ragnar Sigertsen.
[3704.00 - 3711.00] P:1682.55 E:0.175794 |  Now back to Wilsham, Wilsham driving, plays it square though to Rooney who clips it back out to Walker.
[3711.00 - 3713.00] P:1622.94 E:0.151420 |  He has to back-tattle and chest it down.
[3713.00 - 3718.00] P:1756.34 E:0.183231 |  Lots of white shirts in the area, Walker's delivery is very deep, almost right over the penalty area.
[3718.00 - 3723.00] P:1741.24 E:0.165036 |  Sterling though, skampers after it, Sterling has it back in possession, puts his foot on the ball.
[3723.00 - 3731.00] P:1728.88 E:0.183104 |  Sterling taking on Cy Varson, plays it into his shins, but the right back is able to recover and tap it out for a throw in next to the corner flag.
[3731.00 - 3742.00] P:1729.95 E:0.189236 |  And England are going to break a second change now with almost an hour gone, and it is Sterling who makes way and Vardi will come on to replace him.
[3742.00 - 3747.00] P:1788.05 E:0.178142 |  So it was a risk, Danny, to bring on, to start with Raheem Sterling.
[3747.00 - 3754.00] P:1752.52 E:0.190842 |  He won the early penalty, but since then he's made a little contribution and Jamie Vardi now comes on.
[3754.00 - 3758.00] P:1710.58 E:0.210265 |  And will this mean a change for England in terms of the formation I wonder?
[3758.00 - 3760.00] P:1871.31 E:0.191435 |  Yeah, he's just spoken to Deli Alley.
[3760.00 - 3766.00] P:1771.42 E:0.146399 |  Yeah, Vardi speaking to Sturridge as well, throwing is taken.
[3766.00 - 3771.00] P:1732.69 E:0.183352 |  Iceland are winning 2-1, here's Walker, two Sturridge who peels away from Skullassen.
[3771.00 - 3773.00] P:1640.12 E:0.162427 |  Just got a little touch on that though, the left back.
[3773.00 - 3777.00] P:1681.78 E:0.152519 |  Sturridge then in the full back area on his left foot, crosses deflected.
[3777.00 - 3782.00] P:1807.01 E:0.164405 |  Alley is there but hoists his shot from 12 yards high over the crossbar.
[3782.00 - 3786.00] P:1812.82 E:0.163028 |  Well, we said before the game, when chances arise, got to take them.
[3786.00 - 3797.00] P:1802.44 E:0.165031 |  It did bounce up a little bit awkwardly at a difficult height, but he does just misjudge it very, very slightly, comes off the top of his ankle rather than his foot.
[3797.00 - 3801.00] P:1547.80 E:0.182246 |  Have we got a change for England in terms of the formation?
[3801.00 - 3805.00] P:1557.60 E:0.174275 |  Rooney's actually moved to a right of centre position.
[3805.00 - 3807.00] P:1508.26 E:0.159877 |  Yeah, Alley's come out to the left-hand side, that's it.
[3807.00 - 3812.00] P:1447.32 E:0.149983 |  Whereas it's almost a 4-4-2.
[3812.00 - 3819.00] P:1504.95 E:0.176731 |  England 1, Iceland 2, Rooney, miscontrols it, so Guilty Sigurdsson wins it back from him.
[3819.00 - 3826.00] P:1703.88 E:0.165506 |  Sigurdsson trying to draw the foul, in actual fact plays the pass to Goodmanson and Danny Rose is able to come across and nip it away from Goodmanson.
[3826.00 - 3830.00] P:1663.18 E:0.139527 |  Hart put under pressure, great pressing from Goodmanson.
[3830.00 - 3840.00] P:1686.57 E:0.194783 |  Now Walker, we're in the last half hour, Walker away from Sigthorsson, Walker still going, but there is a covering challenge, fortunate for Walker that he was able to take it on.
[3840.00 - 3847.00] P:1690.11 E:0.163693 |  And then yet again another Icelandic defender, Skullsson arrives on the scene and they have it back.
[3847.00 - 3855.00] P:1740.52 E:0.182386 |  What I want to know, John, has Roy Hodgson said to the players at half-time, right, if it's not going well in the first 15 minutes, I'm bringing on Vardy and this is how I want you to play.
[3855.00 - 3862.00] P:1752.12 E:0.193341 |  Ali, very nearly found the pass through the slurrage, only half cleared, Rooney couldn't pick up the loose ball.
[3862.00 - 3867.00] P:1829.51 E:0.205603 |  Or is it like Slovakia, where he's just gone, oh let's just put more forward players on and see what happens.
[3867.00 - 3877.00] P:1719.26 E:0.212491 |  Goodmanson lifts a ball downfield, Gary Keahill is fouled by Bjarneasen, much to the anger of the Icelandic supporters.
[3877.00 - 3881.00] P:1873.82 E:0.188881 |  Breaking play though, a chance to bring in Chris Waddle.
[3882.00 - 3891.00] P:1673.56 E:0.209269 |  Yep, well John I think you're asking questions, but when they do get the ball away, they've got four or five in the box, the quality or they don't deliver or the quality is very, very poor.
[3891.00 - 3900.00] P:1526.41 E:0.181663 |  The force in this year obviously, Iceland are dropping off slightly, coming off the pace, but they still carry that massive threat on the counter attack and Indian are still not using the ball well enough.
[3900.00 - 3909.00] P:1626.76 E:0.180422 |  Five live, England one, Iceland two, tomorrow on five live, we'll bring you commentary on Andy Murray's first round match at Wimbledon, second on centre court.
[3909.00 - 3919.00] P:1691.61 E:0.177479 |  Coverage on five live at Wimbledon from 12 o'clock tomorrow, but if this scoreline stays the same, there'll be enormous fallout from it at breakfast and throughout the day.
[3919.00 - 3929.00] P:1641.52 E:0.170100 |  And indeed in 6-06 tonight with Dan Walkat, who's presenting it from Paris, along with Chris, along Paul from Welsh are into the penalty area, but it's over the top of Vardy.
[3929.00 - 3933.00] P:1717.86 E:0.186155 |  And the two central defenders there doing a job on Vardy and it bounces through to the goalkeeper.
[3933.00 - 3947.00] P:1671.22 E:0.179965 |  And this is what I'm concerned about, John. Has Roy Hodgson really said, this is what happens if I bring Jamie Vardy on, this is how we're going to play in this situation, or are they just making it up as they go along?
[3947.00 - 3954.00] P:1641.66 E:0.179521 |  That is my concern. I'd have brought on Rashford. Vardy wants to run in behind, run into the space. There is no space.
[3954.00 - 3961.00] P:1716.84 E:0.155216 |  Roy Hodgson has one substitution left. They might just have one substitution left as England manager.
[3961.00 - 3969.00] P:1662.21 E:0.163916 |  Willship plays it forward. It deflects. Kane back to Willship, but it's a bouncing ball. He loses out, but then Smalling plays it back into the centre circle.
[3969.00 - 3982.00] P:1670.07 E:0.177436 |  Iceland still lead to one. Walkat. Then back to Cahill. And Cahill. Willship once again drops deep and makes himself available.
[3982.00 - 3989.00] P:1640.31 E:0.181213 |  But Iceland just sitting in there and saying to England, come on then. What have you got? Are you going to be able to break us down?
[3989.00 - 3998.00] P:1797.29 E:0.185017 |  Willship. Willship. Curling pass. I'm not sure Rose is going to be able to reach that. He doesn't. The ball just skins away straight through behind for a goal kick.
[3998.00 - 4008.00] P:1755.70 E:0.140174 |  Well, whatever happens, and if it stays like this, Ian Dennis' first question to Roy Hodgson has to be, what was the plan in the second half?
[4008.00 - 4016.00] P:1752.83 E:0.147664 |  Because at the moment, I can't see it. There doesn't look to be any sort of change from the first half. Yes, he's made substitutions,
[4016.00 - 4028.00] P:1782.48 E:0.161939 |  but I don't see a way of playing, a way to try and break down this defence. Roy Hodgson stands all alone on the edge of the coaching area with his hand on his chin.
[4028.00 - 4037.00] P:1802.24 E:0.163810 |  He has Goodmanson. Goodmanson over hits the pass, so it's a throw in for England. Almost the first time now, we do see Hamia Halgrimson,
[4037.00 - 4048.00] P:1819.27 E:0.160062 |  the young part-time dentist who is about to take over this job as head coach on his own, and he now is there on the edge of the coaching area.
[4048.00 - 4058.00] P:1748.02 E:0.163541 |  He'll be giving up the dentistry, incidentally, in case you were wondering. But England losing to this spirited bunch of Icelandic players.
[4058.00 - 4065.00] P:1678.83 E:0.161590 |  I thought he'd get out of there, he's full of smiles, Roy, then, for a minute. Here is Rooney, Rooney, deflected pass, finds Kane.
[4065.00 - 4071.00] P:1645.75 E:0.199175 |  Kane now has Ali to his left, he's taught them team mate, there's a little short that pass. Ali was fouled there by Goodmanson, he was.
[4071.00 - 4079.00] P:1653.82 E:0.155567 |  And that's a yellow card for Aaron Goodmanson. They're doing well to share out the yellow cards, aren't they?
[4079.00 - 4084.00] P:1621.67 E:0.189394 |  I thought he must surely be one of the players who was on the yellow card away, but he isn't.
[4084.00 - 4089.00] P:1452.32 E:0.167892 |  There's only one player now, I think, is that Bedvardsson, but isn't on a yellow card.
[4089.00 - 4091.00] P:1459.95 E:0.153546 |  That's right, Bedvardsson, who's...
[4091.00 - 4092.00] P:1762.90 E:0.268943 |  He'll be the next one.
[4092.00 - 4095.00] P:1640.31 E:0.154298 |  Well, who either get sent off or obviously miss the next game.
[4095.00 - 4104.00] P:1714.16 E:0.159613 |  Right, free kick, now it's a long way out, this is 35 yards plus. Harry Kane slightly left of centre.
[4104.00 - 4109.00] P:1669.12 E:0.181450 |  Can Harry Kane provide the big moment for England? They're 25 minutes.
[4109.00 - 4115.00] P:1613.05 E:0.187567 |  From an England point of view, the hands of the clock seem to be whizzing around and they're making little impression.
[4115.00 - 4120.00] P:1785.90 E:0.135025 |  Free kick. Harry Kane, waiting to take it.
[4120.00 - 4124.00] P:1761.12 E:0.184087 |  Wall of three Icelandic players and Smallings there as well.
[4124.00 - 4130.00] P:1726.80 E:0.190038 |  So Harry Kane goes for goal, but it's well wide, well wide by six yards and more.
[4130.00 - 4134.00] P:1634.14 E:0.185103 |  And you can hear a little bit of anger, I think, from the England supporters.
[4134.00 - 4141.00] P:1653.27 E:0.145973 |  As if to say, you know, have you not more than that? Have England not got more than that to offer?
[4141.00 - 4143.00] P:1705.00 E:0.180886 |  Back behind that goal to Ian Dennis.
[4143.00 - 4147.00] P:1699.25 E:0.188356 |  Yeah, behind me, they're over my left shoulder, cries of what was that?
[4147.00 - 4152.00] P:1629.99 E:0.156654 |  A few expletives in there as well, booze and jeers, and they're getting very, very restless.
[4154.00 - 4160.00] P:1644.07 E:0.164273 |  Just over a quarter of the 90 minutes to go, and England heading out.
[4160.00 - 4165.00] P:1737.89 E:0.176167 |  Sturridge on the right, Sturridge is crossed, headed down by Gunnarsson, no one there on a white shirt.
[4165.00 - 4170.00] P:1776.93 E:0.176991 |  Three players inside the box, but it's hammered away downfield by the blue shirts of Iceland.
[4170.00 - 4175.00] P:1664.59 E:0.151485 |  And it's eventually bouncing out of play for a three, that Smalling will take to Cahill.
[4175.00 - 4180.00] P:1695.07 E:0.165978 |  Show many England supporters have had all sorts of plans put in place to head to Paris
[4180.00 - 4187.00] P:1619.42 E:0.155386 |  in the expectation that Iceland would be dismissed and it would be France against England on Sunday night.
[4187.00 - 4194.00] P:1764.29 E:0.142174 |  But not so. He has Rooney, Rooney winning his 115th cap tonight.
[4194.00 - 4200.00] P:1842.89 E:0.165346 |  He scored his 53rd goal for England. Cain, then Wiltshire, back to Rooney again.
[4200.00 - 4206.00] P:1775.90 E:0.191154 |  Rooney has a look up, Dummies to cross on then Guilty Sigurdsson cleverly recovers
[4206.00 - 4212.00] P:1651.16 E:0.159008 |  and puts it out of play on a far side. Even Rooney's laboring now, maybe trying to do too much on his own.
[4212.00 - 4218.00] P:1876.77 E:0.171646 |  Rooney chips it infield to Wiltshire. Wiltshire chests it down into his path, shoots low,
[4218.00 - 4222.00] P:1678.10 E:0.178404 |  but that's worldwide as well by six yards and more. It's exactly the same as for Vacchia.
[4222.00 - 4226.00] P:1759.87 E:0.167795 |  It's basically saying we need an individual to come up with something special.
[4226.00 - 4233.00] P:1705.49 E:0.166834 |  There's no real game plan. There's no clear obvious tactical way to break down this side.
[4233.00 - 4241.00] P:1685.79 E:0.157747 |  It's basically hope. It's sorry for England. It's England one, Iceland two, and here's Alan Green.
[4242.00 - 4252.00] P:1685.54 E:0.142142 |  It's clueless. Straight forward, clueless. Exactly as it was in the closing stages of the game against Vacchia.
[4252.00 - 4259.00] P:1581.32 E:0.157605 |  But the question is, I mean Iceland have given an awful lot in this game. Are they going to hold out?
[4259.00 - 4268.00] P:1611.61 E:0.158659 |  It only needs one moment of inspiration from England and surely they have players on the field who could provide that inspiration.
[4268.00 - 4275.00] P:1662.52 E:0.177357 |  And here's Dionyssen, who was earlier in the referee's whistle for a foul challenge.
[4275.00 - 4280.00] P:1597.17 E:0.168070 |  And it's an England free kick. Played by Cahill to the far side and Walker.
[4280.00 - 4288.00] P:1645.24 E:0.170715 |  We've got less than 22 minutes to go. Sturridge with just a hopeful ball forward, easily cleared by Ragnar Sigurdsson,
[4288.00 - 4294.00] P:1585.71 E:0.172742 |  who equalized, remember, a mere matter of seconds after Rooney's penalty put England in front.
[4294.00 - 4301.00] P:1600.52 E:0.197662 |  And then a little bit later, Sigurdsson made it 2-1. That was in the 18th minute. England on the attack down the near side.
[4301.00 - 4307.00] P:1615.45 E:0.192548 |  That's the left. Roses got past one defender, crosses into the penalty here and attempted volley clearance away.
[4307.00 - 4313.00] P:1730.51 E:0.192910 |  Ball falls to Rooney. Oh, Rooney slips. Rooney looks exhausted. He looks out in his feet, Rooney.
[4313.00 - 4314.00] P:1636.32 E:0.224071 |  He lost the ball.
[4314.00 - 4317.00] P:1766.82 E:0.152100 |  He was rested in the last game. He shouldn't be exhausted.
[4317.00 - 4319.00] P:1665.16 E:0.144445 |  That's how he looks, isn't it?
[4319.00 - 4324.00] P:1765.35 E:0.171521 |  I understand. I think maybe he's trying too hard. Possibly players aren't on the same wavelength.
[4324.00 - 4329.00] P:1767.46 E:0.189951 |  He's looking for things and they're not there. And that's why he's hesitating and then getting caught on the ball.
[4329.00 - 4334.00] P:1808.41 E:0.188440 |  Goodest of pleasure to Savarsson over the halfway line. It's played long goodness gracious.
[4334.00 - 4337.00] P:1600.31 E:0.182885 |  There were suddenly two against one for Iceland, off against Cahill.
[4337.00 - 4340.00] P:1652.53 E:0.196064 |  It says, well, Cahill headed the ball clear to safety.
[4340.00 - 4345.00] P:1704.68 E:0.186186 |  Now, Harry Kane. Kane on the party. Party into the penalty. Good tackle.
[4345.00 - 4350.00] P:1619.99 E:0.215438 |  Nothing wrong with a challenge. It might not even go behind for a corner. I think it has.
[4350.00 - 4354.00] P:1866.39 E:0.181883 |  There's a corner. What a tackle. Great tackle.
[4354.00 - 4360.00] P:1897.19 E:0.195005 |  First opportunity for Jamie Vardy. Turn, running the goal scorer, Sigurdsson.
[4360.00 - 4368.00] P:1887.33 E:0.164644 |  And he dives in. Last ditch challenge. Hooks his foot around the ball. Outstanding defending.
[4368.00 - 4373.00] P:1772.12 E:0.194020 |  Exactly what the goalkeeper didn't do in the challenge on Sterling, which led to England's penalty.
[4373.00 - 4376.00] P:1806.79 E:0.164729 |  Had to time it. Absolute perfection indeed.
[4376.00 - 4380.00] P:1624.30 E:0.176876 |  So, Rooney just hit the corner in front of the England fans. 20 minutes left for play.
[4380.00 - 4386.00] P:1631.34 E:0.182119 |  England trailed by two goals to one here in five lines. Rooney from the left to deliver right footed.
[4386.00 - 4390.00] P:1630.76 E:0.188760 |  There it goes into the near post and it's a simple header clear. Didn't beat the first defender.
[4390.00 - 4394.00] P:1789.03 E:0.151671 |  Now, Wilshire. Back to Rose. Rooney's available down the left side.
[4394.00 - 4398.00] P:1677.56 E:0.167249 |  Rose doesn't need his captain at the moment. Now he calls. It's played to Rooney.
[4398.00 - 4405.00] P:1800.68 E:0.179952 |  He steps inside. Flicks it. Overhits it. Wildly overhits it. Behind for a goal kick.
[4407.00 - 4409.00] P:1936.66 E:0.201016 |  Chris is not getting any better, is it?
[4409.00 - 4417.00] P:1751.34 E:0.182697 |  No. Unfortunately, Sturridge has gone out the game. Sturridge has got to start wandering and get on the ball somewhere around the last third.
[4417.00 - 4424.00] P:1616.81 E:0.198579 |  He's just not getting anything on that wing now. We're really unfortunate. He's doing everything and some are coming off some are not.
[4424.00 - 4429.00] P:1541.63 E:0.222900 |  But he's the only one who's seems to be getting on the ball and demanding the ball and you need a few more to follow him.
[4429.00 - 4434.00] P:1380.97 E:0.188089 |  But Aislin very comfortable at the minute. Defending very, very comfortably.
[4434.00 - 4439.00] P:1536.99 E:0.191052 |  Rose and the ball. Finds Alley. Party in the edge of the penalty chair. That was a great ball by Barney.
[4439.00 - 4444.00] P:1455.04 E:0.197795 |  Harry Kane couldn't control that. But Sturridge keeps it a play in the far side of the field.
[4444.00 - 4451.00] P:1651.64 E:0.175616 |  England won Aislin too. Here's Jack Wilshire. And Wilshire wants with the left side.
[4451.00 - 4457.00] P:1759.80 E:0.182602 |  The ball is into Smalling. Now it's Kane and it's going right. It's your Walker.
[4457.00 - 4463.00] P:1766.32 E:0.171424 |  Walker with Sturridge to his right. Not the best of passes to Sturridge. Sturridge gets there before Skullisen.
[4463.00 - 4469.00] P:1779.96 E:0.180821 |  The left back. And it goes. Kane shoots. Blocked by the defender. How many blocks of Aislin made?
[4469.00 - 4476.00] P:1688.63 E:0.176433 |  They just defend so well. Then Bjarneson on the far side of the field. Bjarneson almost got beyond Walker.
[4476.00 - 4481.00] P:1725.34 E:0.152497 |  Bjarneson has to stop now. Into Guilfee-Sigertsen. Guilfee-Sigertsen to Bjarneson once more.
[4481.00 - 4485.00] P:1586.98 E:0.166768 |  Balls on the halfway line. Down to Aislandic left. Back to Skullisen.
[4485.00 - 4491.00] P:1695.30 E:0.180142 |  And they're getting confident now Aislin. Passing the ball amongst themselves. Making England chase.
[4491.00 - 4496.00] P:1660.01 E:0.207575 |  England aren't chasing very well at the moment. And you hear the response from the Aislandic fans.
[4496.00 - 4500.00] P:1752.91 E:0.191618 |  That's a great crossfield ball hit by the captain Gunnarsson to the right side.
[4500.00 - 4505.00] P:1687.10 E:0.188456 |  And Cyberson into the England pender. Shirtson is just over the crossbar.
[4505.00 - 4509.00] P:1897.12 E:0.174838 |  And he can't entirely convince that Johard had it covered.
[4509.00 - 4514.00] P:1880.82 E:0.165627 |  Great strike from the fallback. Just sat up nicely for him. Just bobbled up.
[4514.00 - 4517.00] P:1702.31 E:0.197236 |  I think Johard might have got there. Had it been under the crossbar.
[4517.00 - 4521.00] P:1736.93 E:0.203472 |  But don't worry, we watched probably the worst game ever in European Championship history.
[4521.00 - 4522.00] P:1794.16 E:0.124300 |  It was.
[4522.00 - 4527.00] P:1750.45 E:0.177829 |  There were no shots. England have not had a shot on target in this second half.
[4527.00 - 4531.00] P:1596.38 E:0.186140 |  Well that's the thing that has disappointed me. Among so many things tonight about England's performance.
[4531.00 - 4535.00] P:1628.46 E:0.176148 |  We talked about the chances they created in the group games. Danny, undoubtedly they did.
[4535.00 - 4540.00] P:1701.73 E:0.181503 |  They didn't score the goals that the chances merited. But tonight they haven't even had chances.
[4540.00 - 4544.00] P:1743.47 E:0.165506 |  The goals he did score. Die is free kick. The goalkeeper dived the wrong way to start with.
[4544.00 - 4550.00] P:1721.84 E:0.161439 |  You know, poor goalkeeping. Bardi was lucky. It was an offside. You know, Ashley Williams headed it backwards.
[4550.00 - 4554.00] P:1657.13 E:0.182363 |  Storage. OK, that was a decent goal. Caught the keeper out. And then Rooney gets a penalty.
[4554.00 - 4559.00] P:1688.73 E:0.174499 |  Terrible ball by Ali, but Walker made the best of it. Kept it in England's possession.
[4559.00 - 4563.00] P:1647.03 E:0.183952 |  It's with Rooney. On to Walker again. They run forward by Ali.
[4563.00 - 4567.00] P:1718.39 E:0.179571 |  Walker tried to find storage. That was an easy option and he didn't do it.
[4567.00 - 4571.00] P:1610.58 E:0.169991 |  And now it's cleared over the half-way line. Sigtorsen on the far side of the field.
[4571.00 - 4576.00] P:1740.16 E:0.189961 |  Just encouraging the England defender to put the ball out of play for what the Icelandic wanted.
[4576.00 - 4581.00] P:1799.14 E:0.146603 |  A throwing. And they'll slow it down. And who would blame them?
[4581.00 - 4587.00] P:1807.25 E:0.182661 |  It is a sensational story what Iceland are doing in this European Championship.
[4587.00 - 4592.00] P:1782.70 E:0.176466 |  England are going to make another change and it's Marcus Rashford who's coming on.
[4592.00 - 4594.00] P:1835.78 E:0.120423 |  I just hope it's not too late.
[4594.00 - 4599.00] P:1727.91 E:0.187193 |  It could be for storage because otherwise it's just a matter of putting on every attacking play you've got
[4599.00 - 4604.00] P:1730.43 E:0.198422 |  and hoping that something comes up. There's a mistake. The ball is with Iceland in the edge of the England penalty here.
[4604.00 - 4609.00] P:1694.28 E:0.188921 |  But Goodmanson could not find his way through. The ball's back to heart.
[4609.00 - 4615.00] P:1691.53 E:0.143136 |  And now it's cleared to Rose. On to Ali. Over the half-way line. England left.
[4615.00 - 4621.00] P:1822.03 E:0.126553 |  Rashford will be a change. Eminent.
[4621.00 - 4627.00] P:1771.89 E:0.166331 |  Arguably he should have come on instead of Vardy. But who knows? Here is Vardy.
[4627.00 - 4631.00] P:1710.89 E:0.170047 |  The big concern is England aren't battering Iceland at the moment.
[4631.00 - 4634.00] P:1836.09 E:0.173936 |  Creating a chance up the chance. The goal keeps having an absolute worldie.
[4634.00 - 4636.00] P:1547.04 E:0.184680 |  Is that nothing to do in this second half?
[4636.00 - 4640.00] P:1727.01 E:0.189549 |  16 minutes left to play. Good ball forward to Harry Kane. Edge of the penalty.
[4640.00 - 4646.00] P:1653.51 E:0.195488 |  Kane was then falling on the defender. He was trying to encourage a free kick or a penalty kick.
[4646.00 - 4650.00] P:1560.36 E:0.176682 |  Even better. He got neither rightly so. And Bjarnasson is the ball for Iceland.
[4650.00 - 4655.00] P:1546.82 E:0.142593 |  On to the far side of the field and Bryd Barson. Bryd Barson moving in.
[4655.00 - 4659.00] P:1666.27 E:0.163993 |  And then taps it back to his central defender. Sigurdsson. That's Ragnar Sigurdsson.
[4659.00 - 4664.00] P:1641.53 E:0.175110 |  His clearance over the half-way line which is just a way of giving England the ball back.
[4664.00 - 4666.00] P:1688.32 E:0.145299 |  I think England will get lucky.
[4666.00 - 4670.00] P:1706.38 E:0.173198 |  Cahill to Ali in the centre of the Iceland half. On it goes to Wiltshire.
[4670.00 - 4674.00] P:1809.90 E:0.190199 |  Wiltshire approaching the penalty. The Sturridge wafts the ball into the air.
[4674.00 - 4678.00] P:1666.99 E:0.201923 |  Into the box. The header on and it's easily saved by the goalkeeper.
[4678.00 - 4684.00] P:1864.58 E:0.178933 |  As it stands, I can't see it being a brilliant team goal or something magical.
[4684.00 - 4687.00] P:1834.12 E:0.143867 |  They're going to have to get lucky at some point.
[4687.00 - 4693.00] P:1861.68 E:0.164845 |  The goalkeeper still hasn't had a save to make. And this is exactly what happened against Slovakia.
[4693.00 - 4697.00] P:1829.75 E:0.167764 |  Chock on all the players. And I go, whatever happens, if Denau's listening to Denne game,
[4697.00 - 4701.00] P:1740.36 E:0.153169 |  you have to ask Roy Hodgson what was the plan in the second half.
[4701.00 - 4705.00] P:1731.05 E:0.173812 |  And was there a plan when you brought on the substitutes that the players were told at half-time?
[4705.00 - 4707.00] P:1661.27 E:0.160831 |  Because it doesn't look like there is.
[4707.00 - 4711.00] P:1774.90 E:0.203037 |  They could perform the edge of the England penalty. There was a foul challenge but it's with Bryd Barson.
[4711.00 - 4714.00] P:1869.63 E:0.186901 |  Bryd Barson still going edge of the six-yard box.
[4714.00 - 4717.00] P:1771.84 E:0.192276 |  Taps it to a non-existent blue shot on the far side of the field.
[4717.00 - 4720.00] P:1823.16 E:0.199957 |  And it's cleared by Sturridge with straight into Iceland's possession again.
[4720.00 - 4723.00] P:1674.69 E:0.198399 |  Inside the final quarter of an hour. Iceland lead 2-1.
[4723.00 - 4727.00] P:1744.47 E:0.180577 |  And then Skullis from the left back looks exhausted as he came forward.
[4727.00 - 4729.00] P:1763.35 E:0.182603 |  And the ball squirts through to Johar.
[4729.00 - 4733.00] P:1724.81 E:0.156082 |  Maybe the first question to Roy Hodgson should be, do you have a nerve?
[4733.00 - 4735.00] P:1760.08 E:0.152691 |  And are you going to try to stay on your job?
[4735.00 - 4738.00] P:1785.05 E:0.171606 |  No, I think he's got to ask him what the plan was in the second half.
[4738.00 - 4740.00] P:1700.54 E:0.163672 |  Because that has been done whatsoever.
[4740.00 - 4744.00] P:1817.47 E:0.176251 |  Iceland are now making a couple of changes. They've all worked very, very hard.
[4744.00 - 4748.00] P:1804.34 E:0.165510 |  If Iceland had decent attacking players, no, that's wrong.
[4748.00 - 4753.00] P:1687.79 E:0.179593 |  If they were better at attacking in numbers, they could be winning this four or five-one at the moment.
[4753.00 - 4755.00] P:1790.57 E:0.176395 |  They've had better chances.
[4755.00 - 4758.00] P:1787.15 E:0.196223 |  They've created better opportunities in the second half than England have.
[4758.00 - 4761.00] P:1866.02 E:0.180474 |  Elmer, Bjarnasson is coming on to.
[4761.00 - 4766.00] P:1876.12 E:0.179534 |  We've got two Bjarnasons on the pitch and the man being replaced is Bryd Barson.
[4768.00 - 4771.00] P:1805.87 E:0.163068 |  And there's no great hurry, is there?
[4772.00 - 4774.00] P:1805.74 E:0.201033 |  Is there any plan that was on the booking?
[4774.00 - 4776.00] P:1815.57 E:0.082567 |  Sorry, hold on a second.
[4776.00 - 4778.00] P:1881.30 E:0.142633 |  Is that a change of plan?
[4778.00 - 4782.00] P:1794.46 E:0.145206 |  Because actually the player who's come off, Sik Dorson.
[4782.00 - 4784.00] P:1620.33 E:0.167034 |  I think they've put up the wrong number.
[4784.00 - 4786.00] P:1723.36 E:0.181399 |  Yeah, Sik Dorson has come up.
[4786.00 - 4789.00] P:1591.94 E:0.156669 |  Even at European Championship level, they've got it wrong with officials.
[4789.00 - 4792.00] P:1823.24 E:0.143162 |  Bryd Barson stays on the field.
[4793.00 - 4797.00] P:1753.03 E:0.128876 |  They've worked so hard, those two strikers.
[4797.00 - 4801.00] P:1744.92 E:0.150442 |  Iceland nevertheless look very tired themselves.
[4801.00 - 4806.00] P:1668.29 E:0.155106 |  They'd be just holding England out, even though, frankly, on this England display,
[4806.00 - 4809.00] P:1595.00 E:0.129176 |  it hasn't been that difficult to hold England out.
[4810.00 - 4814.00] P:1861.88 E:0.179276 |  England one, Iceland two, 13 minutes to go.
[4814.00 - 4816.00] P:1794.81 E:0.165903 |  Bring in Chris Mordell in just a moment.
[4816.00 - 4824.00] P:1793.89 E:0.155015 |  Here's Rose, back to smalling, inside the England half, on to Cahill and Cahill to Wilshire.
[4824.00 - 4827.00] P:1652.74 E:0.180824 |  And Wilshire just of age being caught in possession there in the far side of the field.
[4827.00 - 4832.00] P:1724.03 E:0.149056 |  Then he puts Walker under pressure, Sturridge collects it, back to Cahill.
[4832.00 - 4834.00] P:1614.54 E:0.178482 |  Rooney drops into the centre circle.
[4834.00 - 4836.00] P:1612.12 E:0.157571 |  The captain on the halfway line.
[4836.00 - 4840.00] P:1794.58 E:0.128464 |  Rooney slides the pass to the far side of the field.
[4840.00 - 4842.00] P:1730.16 E:0.179370 |  And it's with Walker the right fullback.
[4842.00 - 4847.00] P:1852.99 E:0.155286 |  We've got 12 and a half minutes, plus out of time remaining here in Nice.
[4847.00 - 4850.00] P:1895.91 E:0.150657 |  The future is not bright.
[4850.00 - 4852.00] P:1887.69 E:0.160762 |  Here's Rooney again.
[4852.00 - 4855.00] P:1796.67 E:0.166886 |  To Kane, who dropped into the inside right channel.
[4855.00 - 4859.00] P:1716.13 E:0.175488 |  Kane sweeps across in the direction of Barney, headed away by the defender.
[4859.00 - 4861.00] P:1809.08 E:0.167967 |  And it's still inside the penalty area.
[4861.00 - 4864.00] P:1529.85 E:0.172400 |  Barney challenging for the ball and wins it back for England.
[4864.00 - 4866.00] P:1713.39 E:0.161402 |  Barney plays it to Walker.
[4866.00 - 4868.00] P:1645.11 E:0.140084 |  To Barney once more.
[4868.00 - 4870.00] P:1851.09 E:0.172339 |  Sturridge is inside the penalty area.
[4870.00 - 4872.00] P:1770.49 E:0.168229 |  The pass goes back to Wilshire.
[4872.00 - 4873.00] P:1617.69 E:0.227365 |  Wilshire chips it forward.
[4873.00 - 4874.00] P:1988.19 E:0.198966 |  Kane is there!
[4874.00 - 4876.00] P:1758.41 E:0.182817 |  Head straight in the goalkeeper.
[4876.00 - 4878.00] P:1794.38 E:0.158375 |  And he wasn't offside.
[4878.00 - 4880.00] P:1854.65 E:0.159191 |  Wasn't the easiest of chances.
[4880.00 - 4882.00] P:1780.53 E:0.199940 |  He pulled off at the back post.
[4882.00 - 4885.00] P:1721.93 E:0.157618 |  Goalkeeper was in a very, very good position.
[4885.00 - 4887.00] P:1620.18 E:0.147516 |  Centre of the goal.
[4887.00 - 4891.00] P:1446.13 E:0.155350 |  I'm not a centre forward, but I think that's a difficult chance to score from that angle.
[4891.00 - 4894.00] P:1543.06 E:0.184262 |  You almost just got to loop it into the far corner.
[4894.00 - 4896.00] P:1577.53 E:0.171540 |  What are your thoughts, Chris Waddle?
[4896.00 - 4898.00] P:1309.87 E:0.218708 |  I totally agree with Danny. It's not an easy chance.
[4898.00 - 4900.00] P:1325.72 E:0.194269 |  Good ball, good movement by Oli Kane.
[4900.00 - 4902.00] P:1468.18 E:0.212231 |  But they're not crosses, Alan. They're coming through the middle again.
[4902.00 - 4904.00] P:1547.86 E:0.195510 |  All the time, they're getting shots blocked.
[4904.00 - 4906.00] P:1122.12 E:0.221280 |  Don't put the ball in when they get away, though.
[4906.00 - 4908.00] P:1339.74 E:0.179802 |  Put the ball in the box.
[4908.00 - 4912.00] P:1581.07 E:0.144439 |  11 in a bit minutes to go.
[4912.00 - 4915.00] P:1748.25 E:0.160189 |  Here's Gunnerson, the captain, with the throw in.
[4915.00 - 4919.00] P:1728.72 E:0.192383 |  He's not near enough to the penalty area to throw it into the England box.
[4919.00 - 4924.00] P:1650.69 E:0.142648 |  It now pops up on the left-hand side with Bickir Bjarneson.
[4924.00 - 4926.00] P:1659.53 E:0.143337 |  Onto the substitute.
[4926.00 - 4928.00] P:1469.89 E:0.150468 |  Elmer Bjarneson.
[4928.00 - 4931.00] P:1675.54 E:0.184317 |  He loses it and then he foul tackles it in the England player.
[4931.00 - 4934.00] P:1625.48 E:0.189462 |  And it's going to be a free kick to go into the right of the penalty area.
[4934.00 - 4936.00] P:1844.12 E:0.151743 |  Jew Hart rushes to take it.
[4936.00 - 4941.00] P:1740.61 E:0.129177 |  Hart certainly at fault for the second Icelandic goal.
[4941.00 - 4944.00] P:1549.33 E:0.115436 |  Now it's with Ramsey.
[4944.00 - 4947.00] P:1654.38 E:0.154542 |  Ramsey's middle of his own half.
[4947.00 - 4949.00] P:1677.46 E:0.135953 |  Onto Rooney.
[4949.00 - 4951.00] P:1670.16 E:0.200091 |  Ali rushes forward, inside left channel.
[4951.00 - 4954.00] P:1599.89 E:0.182017 |  Sturridge has been given the freedom to wander the fears.
[4954.00 - 4957.00] P:1615.67 E:0.182042 |  Sturridge pops up, just left of the centre circle at the moment.
[4957.00 - 4959.00] P:1607.39 E:0.185587 |  Sturridge, good ball forward to Kane.
[4959.00 - 4962.00] P:1642.06 E:0.189625 |  Kane to Ali. Ali chips it towards Vardy.
[4962.00 - 4966.00] P:1726.94 E:0.181550 |  Vardy is there, but the goalkeeper advanced quickly and got through the ball first.
[4966.00 - 4968.00] P:1832.96 E:0.131529 |  What happened to Rashford?
[4968.00 - 4970.00] P:1809.39 E:0.187460 |  What did happen to Rashford?
[4970.00 - 4972.00] P:1751.88 E:0.121210 |  He was stripped, ready to come on.
[4972.00 - 4975.00] P:1592.95 E:0.154926 |  Uh, mmm, wasn't he?
[4975.00 - 4978.00] P:1692.59 E:0.137881 |  Well, he's still not on.
[4978.00 - 4982.00] P:1724.97 E:0.166338 |  And even so, I was opposing the question who he'd come on for.
[4982.00 - 4984.00] P:1637.36 E:0.163636 |  I thought he'd come on for Sturridge.
[4984.00 - 4987.00] P:1717.79 E:0.079579 |  But let's see.
[4987.00 - 4989.00] P:1716.23 E:0.124757 |  Dear, dear.
[4989.00 - 4991.00] P:1754.90 E:0.133481 |  Here's Wilshire.
[4991.00 - 4994.00] P:1771.86 E:0.156082 |  We've got ten minutes to go here in five line.
[4994.00 - 4996.00] P:1788.97 E:0.179068 |  England one, Iceland two.
[4996.00 - 4998.00] P:1605.83 E:0.147944 |  Walker on the far side of the field.
[4998.00 - 5001.00] P:1732.68 E:0.151668 |  Walker has to play it back to Kehl.
[5001.00 - 5003.00] P:1893.49 E:0.154695 |  No options further forward.
[5003.00 - 5005.00] P:1910.39 E:0.179117 |  England players two static.
[5005.00 - 5007.00] P:1895.23 E:0.168576 |  Iceland players marking.
[5007.00 - 5009.00] P:1872.78 E:0.159608 |  Milestone for Iceland, 80 minutes.
[5009.00 - 5011.00] P:1870.10 E:0.175684 |  They've got now ten minutes to hang on.
[5011.00 - 5015.00] P:1808.24 E:0.172227 |  They will start to believe now that they can make this miracle happen.
[5015.00 - 5019.00] P:1755.28 E:0.176126 |  Well, it would easily be the standout result of this European Championship.
[5019.00 - 5023.00] P:1759.76 E:0.153304 |  And one of the worst England results of all time.
[5023.00 - 5025.00] P:1846.46 E:0.159981 |  The ball play towards Sturridge.
[5025.00 - 5028.00] P:1736.04 E:0.176230 |  Sturridge dances away from two challenges, but not the third.
[5028.00 - 5030.00] P:1713.53 E:0.158607 |  It's played back to Wagner Sigurdsson.
[5030.00 - 5032.00] P:1748.72 E:0.190445 |  He plays at the school of Sturridge in the far side of the field.
[5032.00 - 5035.00] P:1725.37 E:0.203749 |  His attempt at clearance was blocked and now it's won back.
[5035.00 - 5039.00] P:1763.22 E:0.183734 |  And again, Sigurdsson goes in, makes the challenge, brilliant challenge on Vardy.
[5039.00 - 5042.00] P:1605.75 E:0.200892 |  And Sigurdsson is then fouled by Jamie Vardy.
[5042.00 - 5044.00] P:1835.30 E:0.166772 |  Free kick to Iceland.
[5044.00 - 5047.00] P:1918.77 E:0.156295 |  That's how to play against Jamie Vardy.
[5047.00 - 5049.00] P:1849.82 E:0.169628 |  You know, fight fire with fire.
[5049.00 - 5052.00] P:1901.68 E:0.168335 |  You know, Jamie Vardy is a strong, aggressive player.
[5052.00 - 5056.00] P:1873.04 E:0.142143 |  Sigurdsson was quite happy to do that all day long.
[5056.00 - 5060.00] P:1878.59 E:0.134700 |  Two-one Iceland lead.
[5060.00 - 5063.00] P:1781.11 E:0.187491 |  It's a scoreline. It's very hard to believe.
[5063.00 - 5066.00] P:1914.72 E:0.131105 |  Nine minutes to go.
[5066.00 - 5070.00] P:1767.41 E:0.164844 |  And we're not belittling Iceland's performance, are we, Danny?
[5070.00 - 5073.00] P:1576.53 E:0.226532 |  We know they're a really good side in terms of their organisation.
[5073.00 - 5075.00] P:1669.29 E:0.205264 |  We knew what they were going to do.
[5075.00 - 5077.00] P:1822.96 E:0.171552 |  The coach told us how they were going to play.
[5077.00 - 5080.00] P:1734.09 E:0.148145 |  He told us they were going to be dangerous from set pieces.
[5080.00 - 5082.00] P:1720.60 E:0.191573 |  He told us they were going to score.
[5082.00 - 5084.00] P:1652.46 E:0.159845 |  And that's exactly what they've done.
[5084.00 - 5086.00] P:1696.30 E:0.188260 |  A little bit of a skirmish on the far touchline,
[5086.00 - 5091.00] P:1684.38 E:0.143073 |  involving Kay Hill and Bricker Bjarnesson.
[5091.00 - 5094.00] P:1757.48 E:0.144214 |  Play continues with Ingen having possession.
[5094.00 - 5097.00] P:1751.87 E:0.191184 |  It's with Rose. There's nobody wide on the left-hand side for Danny Rose.
[5097.00 - 5101.00] P:1638.71 E:0.198623 |  So he comes forward and obviously, inevitably, he runs into an Iceland challenge
[5101.00 - 5105.00] P:1696.34 E:0.178205 |  and the ball squirts into the England half and I had to play for an England throw-in,
[5105.00 - 5107.00] P:1770.72 E:0.176903 |  which is taken by Joe Hart.
[5107.00 - 5112.00] P:1741.10 E:0.159295 |  82 minutes gone. One header from Harry Kane on target in the second half.
[5112.00 - 5114.00] P:1662.38 E:0.151833 |  That is it. Not good enough.
[5114.00 - 5117.00] P:1682.19 E:0.151782 |  Kay Hill for England.
[5117.00 - 5119.00] P:1730.29 E:0.187849 |  Leaves it for Wiltshire.
[5119.00 - 5123.00] P:1789.13 E:0.180200 |  Wiltshire has Walker inside and it goes to the right fullback.
[5123.00 - 5126.00] P:1653.04 E:0.197579 |  But look at the players further forward. Who's making the run?
[5126.00 - 5128.00] P:1843.48 E:0.176366 |  The pass goes to Kane.
[5128.00 - 5130.00] P:1793.24 E:0.180466 |  Kane almost lost possession, carelessly.
[5130.00 - 5132.00] P:1816.60 E:0.144720 |  It comes back to Smalling.
[5132.00 - 5135.00] P:1707.36 E:0.193490 |  On line to Rooney. Rose is available on the left side.
[5135.00 - 5138.00] P:1799.36 E:0.167208 |  Rose takes it up into Alley.
[5138.00 - 5140.00] P:1718.49 E:0.176590 |  Alley about 30 yards from goal.
[5140.00 - 5142.00] P:1791.24 E:0.186472 |  Alley now to Kane.
[5142.00 - 5144.00] P:1532.69 E:0.184656 |  Kane took it off the ball, probably waiting for the challenge.
[5144.00 - 5148.00] P:1730.47 E:0.181101 |  And it's Bjarnesson on the far side of the field who wins it for Iceland.
[5148.00 - 5152.00] P:1698.74 E:0.178822 |  Back to the left fullback, Skullisen and Coughlin played forward to Guilfrey Sigurdsson.
[5152.00 - 5154.00] P:1811.64 E:0.193253 |  Bjarnesson again, driving it forward.
[5154.00 - 5157.00] P:1789.76 E:0.191579 |  And do you know something? They've still left two players off field, Iceland.
[5157.00 - 5159.00] P:1715.00 E:0.209481 |  They've got to be careful. England are playing two on one at points.
[5159.00 - 5161.00] P:1774.83 E:0.215015 |  Oh, there's a good ball through. The captain's after it.
[5161.00 - 5163.00] P:1837.16 E:0.199988 |  Gunnarsson, end of the penalty here.
[5163.00 - 5166.00] P:1783.82 E:0.223962 |  Gunnarsson still going forward, should save by Hart.
[5166.00 - 5169.00] P:1833.10 E:0.172837 |  Could have been three-one easily.
[5169.00 - 5172.00] P:1875.00 E:0.211629 |  Again, lucky, lucky England.
[5172.00 - 5175.00] P:1950.60 E:0.186216 |  Jack Wiltshire does his best to track back.
[5175.00 - 5178.00] P:1990.49 E:0.159542 |  But he's just brushed aside by the skipper.
[5178.00 - 5182.00] P:1965.61 E:0.171448 |  Who gets it caught under his feet but still manages to get the shot away.
[5182.00 - 5187.00] P:1858.50 E:0.158747 |  Again, fortunate, was a comfortable save in the end for Jo Hart.
[5187.00 - 5191.00] P:1839.15 E:0.194413 |  The lines are open for 6-0-6. 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3.
[5191.00 - 5193.00] P:1782.63 E:0.189634 |  I think the lines might be jammed.
[5193.00 - 5198.00] P:1813.08 E:0.163669 |  Well, less than seven minutes to go before any added time.
[5198.00 - 5200.00] P:1839.56 E:0.145412 |  Iceland have carried more threat.
[5200.00 - 5202.00] P:1774.40 E:0.141978 |  Goal threat in the second half. They've got a corner.
[5202.00 - 5205.00] P:1576.88 E:0.197534 |  Played in, the header was then wide of goal.
[5205.00 - 5208.00] P:1801.08 E:0.168178 |  Hart rushes to get in the ball to take the goal kick as quickly as he can.
[5208.00 - 5210.00] P:1743.74 E:0.176319 |  I said that earlier, Alan.
[5210.00 - 5214.00] P:1706.87 E:0.148683 |  Iceland have created more opportunities in the second half than England have.
[5216.00 - 5218.00] P:1601.68 E:0.135423 |  It's desperate.
[5218.00 - 5221.00] P:1563.53 E:0.181777 |  Where's the next substitution?
[5221.00 - 5223.00] P:1641.60 E:0.188766 |  Rashford has put his bib back on, he's warming up again.
[5223.00 - 5225.00] P:1546.04 E:0.184445 |  He was stripped off by his come on.
[5225.00 - 5227.00] P:1343.08 E:0.191957 |  James Milner's warming up.
[5227.00 - 5231.00] P:1631.65 E:0.170318 |  Roy, we've created one chance in the second half.
[5231.00 - 5235.00] P:1552.46 E:0.187834 |  The thing either Rashford or Milner could provide with.
[5235.00 - 5240.00] P:1569.56 E:0.167710 |  Something's got to change in this last 5-1.5 minutes.
[5240.00 - 5246.00] P:1485.14 E:0.163003 |  As against Slovakia, we wonder about the man on television at the moment.
[5246.00 - 5250.00] P:1486.59 E:0.182234 |  Roy Hodson is his thinking clear now?
[5250.00 - 5253.00] P:1688.04 E:0.149502 |  If it is, has it been transmitted to the players?
[5253.00 - 5255.00] P:1544.12 E:0.176998 |  Are they responding?
[5255.00 - 5258.00] P:1704.80 E:0.173683 |  Here's Alan, into Kane, 35 yards of goal.
[5258.00 - 5260.00] P:1657.32 E:0.192985 |  On it goes, party inside the penalty area.
[5260.00 - 5262.00] P:1748.86 E:0.189512 |  Angle's very acute, party crosses low.
[5262.00 - 5264.00] P:1906.71 E:0.158864 |  Hit high, Kane jumps, Kane heads it down.
[5264.00 - 5267.00] P:1852.01 E:0.194450 |  Brought down by storage, not quickly enough.
[5267.00 - 5270.00] P:1767.94 E:0.167672 |  The flag is up for offside and it's a free kick to Iceland.
[5270.00 - 5274.00] P:1853.54 E:0.179278 |  We've got a bit over 5 minutes to go here in 5-5.
[5274.00 - 5276.00] P:1716.19 E:0.172451 |  Iceland are now going to run the clock down.
[5276.00 - 5281.00] P:1840.51 E:0.162027 |  They're going to boot the ball long as often as they possibly can.
[5281.00 - 5284.00] P:1856.76 E:0.178031 |  And try and just kill the game every opportunity.
[5284.00 - 5289.00] P:1820.29 E:0.173717 |  You normally get at least a good chance in the last 5 minutes.
[5289.00 - 5292.00] P:1720.10 E:0.193640 |  England have created one in 45 minutes.
[5292.00 - 5295.00] P:1800.01 E:0.184632 |  They'll probably get one or two chances.
[5295.00 - 5298.00] P:1761.44 E:0.169961 |  Somebody has got to put it away.
[5298.00 - 5300.00] P:1836.39 E:0.151921 |  Rashford's bib is off.
[5300.00 - 5303.00] P:1786.59 E:0.165837 |  Hodson is standing about 3 yards to his left.
[5303.00 - 5308.00] P:1696.65 E:0.140813 |  There's a hole-of-the-in play for a free kick to Iceland.
[5308.00 - 5310.00] P:1712.69 E:0.159316 |  The substitution can be made now.
[5310.00 - 5312.00] P:1454.43 E:0.159343 |  The fourth official is woken up.
[5312.00 - 5315.00] P:1731.48 E:0.142540 |  That's a number 22 in Rashford's back.
[5315.00 - 5318.00] P:1716.80 E:0.147046 |  What's the number of the England players going to be taken off?
[5318.00 - 5320.00] P:1607.33 E:0.171588 |  We'll not see it yet because Iceland are taking the free kick.
[5320.00 - 5324.00] P:1693.52 E:0.174760 |  Play towards the left side and a glancing header out by Iceland
[5324.00 - 5325.00] P:1724.81 E:0.177943 |  for a throw into England.
[5325.00 - 5327.00] P:1555.65 E:0.171602 |  Deep inside that England half.
[5327.00 - 5331.00] P:1745.02 E:0.143079 |  It's Wayne Rooney who's coming off.
[5331.00 - 5335.00] P:1882.70 E:0.146245 |  Well, almost that sums it up.
[5335.00 - 5339.00] P:1785.73 E:0.193304 |  Rooney unquestionably in storage where England's best players before half-time.
[5339.00 - 5345.00] P:1881.55 E:0.173433 |  I think he's the contribution of the captain to the fell away in the second half.
[5345.00 - 5349.00] P:1848.75 E:0.199698 |  But it's a United colleague who replaces the United captain.
[5349.00 - 5353.00] P:1760.17 E:0.187464 |  I'll tell you what, Roy hasn't half-made a rod for his own back, has he?
[5353.00 - 5358.00] P:1759.57 E:0.180579 |  Playing Raheem Sterling against popular opinion,
[5358.00 - 5361.00] P:1830.46 E:0.191298 |  taking off England's greatest goal scorer
[5361.00 - 5364.00] P:1794.53 E:0.150415 |  in the last four minutes of a match when you're desperate to score a goal.
[5364.00 - 5369.00] P:1619.70 E:0.147257 |  If this doesn't work, I think bye-bye, Roy.
[5369.00 - 5372.00] P:1724.19 E:0.162394 |  Well, here's Rashford.
[5372.00 - 5375.00] P:1685.00 E:0.166474 |  Allie runs forward, was tackled.
[5375.00 - 5379.00] P:1712.91 E:0.177798 |  The ball breaks to Rashford and finally the referee gives an England free kick.
[5379.00 - 5382.00] P:1673.43 E:0.188181 |  Oh, goodness. Allie far too aggressive there
[5382.00 - 5384.00] P:1657.96 E:0.161856 |  and taking the ball back from the Icelandic clear.
[5384.00 - 5387.00] P:1755.19 E:0.193087 |  And then he had a word to say to the referee's gamina.
[5387.00 - 5390.00] P:1705.00 E:0.140597 |  He ran away before he could be booked.
[5390.00 - 5394.00] P:1774.70 E:0.182474 |  England tried to steal a couple of yards, moving the ball in field.
[5394.00 - 5397.00] P:1755.90 E:0.167428 |  It's from the left side for England. Harry Kane to the liver.
[5397.00 - 5399.00] P:1802.56 E:0.176490 |  Three minutes of the 90 to go.
[5399.00 - 5402.00] P:1887.12 E:0.162174 |  England trail Iceland 2-1.
[5402.00 - 5405.00] P:1830.47 E:0.178606 |  England need a goal to take us to extra time.
[5405.00 - 5409.00] P:1800.43 E:0.164242 |  Kane right-footed, plays it wildly over-hitting it.
[5409.00 - 5411.00] P:1691.21 E:0.187337 |  Wildly over-hitting it.
[5411.00 - 5414.00] P:1741.36 E:0.206491 |  Awful. Chris Waddle.
[5414.00 - 5416.00] P:1769.44 E:0.227359 |  I can't believe what I'm watching. I'm sorry.
[5416.00 - 5418.00] P:1636.08 E:0.216112 |  I've just lost four words, Allie.
[5418.00 - 5420.00] P:1689.57 E:0.186921 |  I know England's had some bad results over the years,
[5420.00 - 5423.00] P:1553.45 E:0.175425 |  but to lose to Iceland, I just can't work it out.
[5423.00 - 5427.00] P:1609.05 E:0.158277 |  It's the worst result I've ever seen.
[5427.00 - 5430.00] P:1689.70 E:0.170746 |  Summs it up, as always from Chris Waddle.
[5430.00 - 5432.00] P:1802.98 E:0.162005 |  Ian Dennis' pitchside.
[5432.00 - 5436.00] P:1778.82 E:0.181069 |  Huge show of disapproval with that wasted free kick.
[5436.00 - 5439.00] P:1787.97 E:0.175162 |  The supporters, they're moved before was restless.
[5439.00 - 5442.00] P:1747.79 E:0.174478 |  Now it's just downright angry.
[5442.00 - 5447.00] P:1741.72 E:0.170279 |  Now Trostecin, who scored the winning goal in added time against Austria,
[5447.00 - 5450.00] P:1734.46 E:0.166241 |  he will replace Brud Varsen.
[5450.00 - 5453.00] P:1867.35 E:0.197136 |  We thought he was coming off a few minutes ago.
[5453.00 - 5456.00] P:1925.61 E:0.189408 |  So he makes his way. He's exhausted.
[5456.00 - 5459.00] P:1809.93 E:0.163488 |  I'm not blaming him for trotting slowly.
[5459.00 - 5462.00] P:1797.47 E:0.186365 |  And now only walking towards the near-touch line.
[5462.00 - 5465.00] P:1885.40 E:0.168695 |  Time is running out for England.
[5465.00 - 5467.00] P:1933.07 E:0.189457 |  Two minutes of the night he did go.
[5467.00 - 5470.00] P:1878.46 E:0.171327 |  Then who knows, he might have four minutes about a time.
[5470.00 - 5472.00] P:1818.12 E:0.143002 |  Something like that.
[5472.00 - 5474.00] P:1812.70 E:0.144129 |  I've no idea, but at the moment,
[5474.00 - 5477.00] P:1773.78 E:0.159765 |  England don't even look like creating opportunity,
[5477.00 - 5480.00] P:1789.59 E:0.135421 |  let alone put anyone in the back of the net.
[5480.00 - 5482.00] P:1779.88 E:0.150071 |  Gold kick to Iceland.
[5482.00 - 5485.00] P:1714.23 E:0.180454 |  Holerson, who gave away the penalty for England
[5485.00 - 5487.00] P:1793.83 E:0.158635 |  in the fifth minute of the game.
[5487.00 - 5490.00] P:1858.15 E:0.137261 |  It was a terrible challenge on Sterling.
[5490.00 - 5493.00] P:1796.51 E:0.203741 |  But his team responded and they're responding again.
[5493.00 - 5496.00] P:1720.18 E:0.183690 |  Late in the game, the ball is with Bjarnesson on the far side of the field.
[5496.00 - 5498.00] P:1775.12 E:0.166882 |  That's Elmer Bjarnesson, one of their substitutes.
[5498.00 - 5500.00] P:1677.25 E:0.181762 |  He's tackled by Walker.
[5500.00 - 5502.00] P:1705.03 E:0.138289 |  Ball is still in play.
[5502.00 - 5504.00] P:1829.87 E:0.170898 |  Bjarnesson persistent.
[5504.00 - 5506.00] P:1507.64 E:0.177386 |  He wants a touch off the England defender.
[5506.00 - 5508.00] P:1634.59 E:0.130821 |  He didn't get one and now it's an England throw-in.
[5508.00 - 5513.00] P:1750.50 E:0.167295 |  But it's only a matter of yards from the corner flag of the England half.
[5513.00 - 5515.00] P:1774.55 E:0.196962 |  Throw-in long towards Cahill.
[5515.00 - 5518.00] P:1848.86 E:0.187685 |  Cahill fouled the Icelandic player.
[5518.00 - 5520.00] P:1998.55 E:0.188233 |  We can see it from this distance.
[5520.00 - 5522.00] P:1964.79 E:0.165510 |  Free kick to Iceland.
[5522.00 - 5525.00] P:1881.07 E:0.181826 |  If I was Iceland here, what, 20 yards inside the run-off,
[5525.00 - 5527.00] P:1870.55 E:0.175515 |  I'd go back to the goalkeeper.
[5527.00 - 5530.00] P:1860.18 E:0.197982 |  Kill a few more seconds and launch it back upfield.
[5530.00 - 5536.00] P:1814.89 E:0.165828 |  I mean, you know, Iceland fans are bouncing all over the place.
[5536.00 - 5540.00] P:1682.83 E:0.188859 |  While Greg Dake will be amongst those from the FA watching on
[5540.00 - 5543.00] P:1836.26 E:0.132974 |  in this shocking performance by England.
[5543.00 - 5546.00] P:1772.34 E:0.167058 |  It's not over yet, but there are only seconds to go
[5546.00 - 5549.00] P:1686.81 E:0.170949 |  of the 19 minutes and then we'll have added time.
[5549.00 - 5551.00] P:1775.87 E:0.205216 |  And here's Marcus Rashford, the 18-year-old,
[5551.00 - 5554.00] P:1839.12 E:0.163830 |  sprinting down the left side and he's got past one player.
[5554.00 - 5556.00] P:1639.14 E:0.179459 |  He's now into the penalty area of Rashford.
[5556.00 - 5558.00] P:1722.32 E:0.183899 |  And passing on the player.
[5558.00 - 5560.00] P:1794.36 E:0.174529 |  Can he get the cross and he's won a corner?
[5560.00 - 5562.00] P:1783.90 E:0.196957 |  He tried to get a cross and deflected off of the defender
[5562.00 - 5564.00] P:1860.52 E:0.192924 |  and there is a corner to England.
[5564.00 - 5566.00] P:1815.03 E:0.180097 |  This is why he should have been brought on earlier.
[5566.00 - 5567.00] P:1873.81 E:0.177061 |  He's got confidence.
[5567.00 - 5570.00] P:1835.01 E:0.142449 |  He's got the ability to run up people to dribble.
[5570.00 - 5572.00] P:1741.83 E:0.199291 |  Rashford to take the corner from the left, played in right,
[5572.00 - 5574.00] P:1678.51 E:0.186543 |  put it towards the near post.
[5574.00 - 5576.00] P:1674.25 E:0.183159 |  I think, oh, I thought that came off the defender,
[5576.00 - 5577.00] P:1880.07 E:0.161460 |  but it didn't.
[5577.00 - 5580.00] P:1915.42 E:0.188280 |  It's a gold kick to Iceland and I'm anxiously waiting
[5580.00 - 5583.00] P:1854.18 E:0.173360 |  for the fourth official to tell us how much time
[5583.00 - 5585.00] P:1908.12 E:0.187278 |  will be added on.
[5585.00 - 5587.00] P:1950.79 E:0.175720 |  Just a measly three minutes.
[5587.00 - 5591.00] P:1948.24 E:0.167564 |  Three minutes to save England's participation
[5591.00 - 5593.00] P:1813.50 E:0.172479 |  in the European Championship.
[5593.00 - 5597.00] P:1859.67 E:0.161995 |  I'm not sure anything can save Roy Hodgson's job
[5597.00 - 5599.00] P:1875.14 E:0.128414 |  from this performance.
[5599.00 - 5603.00] P:1873.54 E:0.174685 |  And I know the players, you don't have to take a lot of responsibility,
[5603.00 - 5607.00] P:1757.99 E:0.186370 |  but did England have a clear idea of what to do in the second half?
[5607.00 - 5609.00] P:1773.95 E:0.189511 |  Even if England's gone out, Denneau has to ask him,
[5609.00 - 5611.00] P:1630.82 E:0.165237 |  what was the plan in the second half?
[5611.00 - 5612.00] P:1912.28 E:0.142482 |  Because it's been atrocious.
[5612.00 - 5615.00] P:1905.32 E:0.180451 |  Rashford runs down the left side and he's still running.
[5615.00 - 5617.00] P:1752.98 E:0.177988 |  Rashford, he's tackled and the ball breaks out of play,
[5617.00 - 5618.00] P:1672.85 E:0.219387 |  but it's only a throw in.
[5618.00 - 5620.00] P:1821.88 E:0.173652 |  A yard from the corner flag.
[5620.00 - 5622.00] P:1820.91 E:0.149611 |  We're into added time here in five lines.
[5622.00 - 5627.00] P:1803.14 E:0.191698 |  05-199-6-93, the number to call Chris Waddle and Dan Walker for 6-06.
[5627.00 - 5629.00] P:1822.27 E:0.154555 |  Boy, that would be some listen.
[5629.00 - 5632.00] P:1855.48 E:0.165195 |  Here's the throw by Ali into the penalty area,
[5632.00 - 5634.00] P:1928.05 E:0.212410 |  straight onto an Icelandic boot,
[5634.00 - 5636.00] P:1750.66 E:0.158173 |  and they've got everybody back now.
[5636.00 - 5640.00] P:1914.10 E:0.167924 |  Gunnarsson trying to make sure that not everyone stays back for Iceland.
[5640.00 - 5643.00] P:1764.19 E:0.194472 |  Another cross high into the edge of the Iceland penalty area.
[5643.00 - 5645.00] P:1755.02 E:0.215217 |  Another headed clear by Iceland.
[5645.00 - 5648.00] P:1914.83 E:0.173892 |  Sturridge rushes to the far side, keeps it in play for England.
[5648.00 - 5651.00] P:1869.99 E:0.192517 |  England looked exhausted and without any ideas,
[5651.00 - 5654.00] P:1756.36 E:0.206227 |  not a good ball forward, but Walker did well,
[5654.00 - 5656.00] P:1724.59 E:0.152115 |  winning it back on the far side.
[5656.00 - 5659.00] P:1824.72 E:0.194280 |  Walker crosses right footed, Kane tried to glance ahead of it on,
[5659.00 - 5663.00] P:1784.61 E:0.178878 |  headed away, and now there can be a possible counterattack for Iceland.
[5663.00 - 5665.00] P:1816.54 E:0.172946 |  Was that a foul challenge?
[5665.00 - 5668.00] P:1846.55 E:0.164929 |  Well, it could easily have been a foul challenge on Trosteson,
[5668.00 - 5670.00] P:1791.69 E:0.179632 |  but the referee didn't see it that way.
[5670.00 - 5671.00] P:1997.59 E:0.166452 |  90 seconds to go.
[5671.00 - 5674.00] P:1879.23 E:0.168706 |  It was Rose, Rose tips it forward,
[5674.00 - 5676.00] P:1880.60 E:0.181657 |  headed away by Cyberson,
[5676.00 - 5679.00] P:1676.69 E:0.194866 |  and hit over the halfway line into the England half.
[5679.00 - 5681.00] P:1817.87 E:0.157866 |  Here's Joe Hart.
[5681.00 - 5685.00] P:1868.00 E:0.182771 |  A minute and 20 seconds remain of added time.
[5685.00 - 5688.00] P:1848.24 E:0.189394 |  Hart can come forward to the halfway line.
[5688.00 - 5691.00] P:1932.22 E:0.193702 |  Now he knows he's got to drill it through the middle.
[5691.00 - 5694.00] P:1794.06 E:0.184229 |  Cahill's up from the fence. Cahill jump was beaten in the air,
[5694.00 - 5697.00] P:1804.92 E:0.190744 |  and Iceland can just hold on to it here for a moment.
[5697.00 - 5699.00] P:1673.67 E:0.192298 |  Oh, no, they clear it well,
[5699.00 - 5702.00] P:1840.50 E:0.150792 |  and they've got a chance here, two against two,
[5702.00 - 5704.00] P:1751.91 E:0.170062 |  and that was a foul by Rose.
[5704.00 - 5707.00] P:1682.39 E:0.195267 |  That's got to be a free, oh, no, it's the other way, according to the system.
[5707.00 - 5711.00] P:1659.53 E:0.181487 |  I thought there was a foul on Elmar, to be honest, and listening a free kick.
[5711.00 - 5712.00] P:1756.36 E:0.208870 |  Into the last minute, Alan.
[5712.00 - 5715.00] P:1908.57 E:0.168144 |  Yeah, 50 seconds. Precisely 50 seconds.
[5715.00 - 5718.00] P:1873.39 E:0.167197 |  England trail Iceland 2-1.
[5718.00 - 5720.00] P:1881.28 E:0.129427 |  Rashford wants more.
[5720.00 - 5722.00] P:1762.35 E:0.190991 |  Why wasn't Rashford brought on earlier?
[5722.00 - 5723.00] P:1811.21 E:0.154305 |  Rashford surges forward,
[5723.00 - 5727.00] P:1801.64 E:0.204429 |  edge of the penalty here, and then he trips on the ball, loses possession,
[5727.00 - 5729.00] P:1846.63 E:0.202340 |  and is cleared out of play.
[5729.00 - 5731.00] P:1922.00 E:0.159304 |  Half a minute remaining.
[5731.00 - 5736.00] P:1946.69 E:0.162952 |  Joe Hart rushes to get to the ball, takes the throw in.
[5736.00 - 5740.00] P:1943.45 E:0.169606 |  To Rose. Rose, only one idea in his mind.
[5740.00 - 5742.00] P:1946.10 E:0.165848 |  Slash it forward.
[5742.00 - 5744.00] P:1793.90 E:0.187949 |  Cahill's up there. Cahill didn't win the ball in the air.
[5744.00 - 5746.00] P:1841.77 E:0.131530 |  Ball breaks back.
[5746.00 - 5747.00] P:1893.98 E:0.167541 |  Here's Wiltshire.
[5747.00 - 5749.00] P:1855.75 E:0.166070 |  Wiltshire in to Alley.
[5749.00 - 5752.00] P:1877.50 E:0.177000 |  Alley slides the ball to the far side of the field,
[5752.00 - 5754.00] P:2013.60 E:0.197686 |  and Sturridge crosses in, he can't!
[5754.00 - 5756.00] P:1774.96 E:0.170205 |  Barty heads it wide.
[5756.00 - 5758.00] P:1808.73 E:0.158673 |  It's a corner.
[5758.00 - 5760.00] P:1782.14 E:0.180470 |  There must have been a glance off of the defender.
[5760.00 - 5762.00] P:1747.19 E:0.183869 |  I thought Barty had equalised.
[5762.00 - 5764.00] P:1807.71 E:0.188873 |  Well, that's it. Three minutes of injury time are up.
[5764.00 - 5768.00] P:1806.36 E:0.170592 |  England are now in extra time of injury time.
[5768.00 - 5772.00] P:1795.36 E:0.168513 |  It was a brilliant defensive header by Arneson.
[5772.00 - 5774.00] P:1811.09 E:0.198836 |  We're over the allocated three minutes.
[5774.00 - 5778.00] P:1732.73 E:0.202948 |  Kane's corner played in, and the header down wide of goal.
[5778.00 - 5779.00] P:1832.43 E:0.176771 |  That's it.
[5779.00 - 5781.00] P:1878.49 E:0.205871 |  And that is it!
[5781.00 - 5784.00] P:1892.06 E:0.211614 |  Fantastic win for Iceland.
[5784.00 - 5787.00] P:1816.84 E:0.216694 |  Don't take anything away from Iceland.
[5787.00 - 5789.00] P:1841.16 E:0.213077 |  They were outstanding.
[5789.00 - 5794.00] P:1769.71 E:0.226241 |  Brilliant. They denied England everything, but England were shocking,
[5794.00 - 5798.00] P:1779.28 E:0.216432 |  and this will look down as the worst, amongst the worst result
[5798.00 - 5801.00] P:1763.60 E:0.217914 |  in the history of English international football.
[5801.00 - 5804.00] P:1840.59 E:0.216501 |  No idea. No excuses.
[5804.00 - 5808.00] P:1804.31 E:0.218888 |  England players should be ashamed of themselves.
[5808.00 - 5815.00] P:1866.38 E:0.206986 |  That second half performance was nothing short of atrocious.
[5815.00 - 5818.00] P:1922.86 E:0.206860 |  Hodgson, he's got to go.
[5818.00 - 5820.00] P:1859.20 E:0.219570 |  He has no choice.
[5820.00 - 5822.00] P:1833.07 E:0.202370 |  If he doesn't go, he'd be sacked.
[5822.00 - 5825.00] P:1692.70 E:0.213848 |  There was no plan in the second half, just like Savaki.
