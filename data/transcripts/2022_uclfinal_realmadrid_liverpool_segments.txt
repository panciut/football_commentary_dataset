[0.00 - 2.00] P:1455.62 E:0.126289 |  Shepchenko!
[2.00 - 4.00] P:1627.62 E:0.125021 |  Zidane saves!
[4.00 - 6.00] P:1611.95 E:0.114433 |  For Liverpool!
[6.00 - 9.00] P:1601.77 E:0.116580 |  And against all the odds,
[9.00 - 12.00] P:1689.92 E:0.112884 |  Liverpool have won the Champions League.
[12.00 - 14.00] P:1833.04 E:0.114947 |  Zidane tries to shot!
[14.00 - 16.00] P:1616.76 E:0.112873 |  Oh, a fantastic goal
[16.00 - 20.00] P:1527.52 E:0.110453 |  from one of the greatest players in the world, Zidane!
[20.00 - 22.00] P:1560.61 E:0.129553 |  And there goes the final whistle
[22.00 - 27.00] P:1598.90 E:0.121784 |  as Jürgen Klopp shakes hands with the beaten Maurizio Pozzettino.
[27.00 - 31.00] P:1512.55 E:0.119985 |  The European champions for the sixth time.
[31.00 - 35.00] P:1286.69 E:0.112029 |  Mohamed Salah's lying down in the middle of the Real Madrid half.
[35.00 - 37.00] P:1295.00 E:0.096825 |  This would be a terrible blow.
[37.00 - 40.00] P:1664.45 E:0.111359 |  But you cannot underestimate the size of the blow to Liverpool.
[40.00 - 42.00] P:1669.75 E:0.124492 |  Oh, a head kick! It's in from Bale!
[42.00 - 44.00] P:1476.56 E:0.117984 |  What a goal!
[44.00 - 48.00] P:1503.84 E:0.116350 |  What a brilliant goal in the Champions League final from Gareth Bale,
[48.00 - 50.00] P:1476.57 E:0.106722 |  crushing for Liverpool.
[50.00 - 53.00] P:1563.28 E:0.110574 |  But what a goal from Gareth Bale!
[58.00 - 60.00] P:1421.85 E:0.150923 |  Vensimore!
[60.00 - 62.00] P:1434.89 E:0.118436 |  He's down by Vensimore again!
[62.00 - 65.00] P:1316.74 E:0.122762 |  And Real Madrid take the advantage!
[65.00 - 68.00] P:1615.43 E:0.126631 |  Simacas takes it in and Firmino is there!
[68.00 - 71.00] P:1597.08 E:0.114893 |  On the volley in the six-shot box, excellent finish!
[71.00 - 73.00] P:1108.70 E:0.112148 |  There's always an extra chance, there's always an extra opportunity.
[73.00 - 76.00] P:1148.09 E:0.090275 |  And for us now, in a specific case, it's a Champions League final.
[76.00 - 78.00] P:1413.91 E:0.103440 |  I can't wait to get there and play the game.
[78.00 - 80.00] P:1568.15 E:0.113802 |  Lewisty asks for the header,
[80.00 - 83.00] P:1580.21 E:0.121595 |  and Lewisty asks has got Liverpool's second goal.
[83.00 - 86.00] P:1678.26 E:0.123706 |  And surely they are the Champions League final beckons for Liverpool.
[86.00 - 88.00] P:1116.78 E:0.120959 |  Carvajal with the cross, it's a good one!
[88.00 - 89.00] P:1361.95 E:0.111332 |  Oh, and it in!
[89.00 - 93.00] P:1283.15 E:0.121356 |  And Real Madrid lead by two goals to one!
[93.00 - 97.00] P:930.41 E:0.098086 |  I had the good memory of my time spent in Liverpool on the blue side,
[97.00 - 100.00] P:1321.38 E:0.104539 |  and I'm sure that they will support me.
[100.00 - 103.00] P:1181.90 E:0.116046 |  Vensimore from the penalty spot, scores,
[103.00 - 105.00] P:1290.93 E:0.118499 |  St. Edison the wrong way,
[105.00 - 109.00] P:1085.69 E:0.120135 |  and Real Madrid have now turned this right around.
[109.00 - 113.00] P:1417.30 E:0.124094 |  Mane's away from the challenge of fourth, he's got an open goal,
[113.00 - 119.00] P:1533.68 E:0.120389 |  and he finds it, Sarri Omane secures Liverpool's place in the Champions League final.
[119.00 - 121.00] P:1522.41 E:0.130276 |  There's no stopping Liverpool now.
[125.00 - 129.00] P:1671.39 E:0.093052 |  That was the journey, this is the destination.
[129.00 - 133.00] P:1587.76 E:0.083929 |  The Stade de France, which looks absolutely magnificent.
[133.00 - 136.00] P:1717.84 E:0.098082 |  The still blue sky with a little peppered white cloud,
[136.00 - 140.00] P:1578.56 E:0.083216 |  above the great open bowl of the stadium here.
[140.00 - 144.00] P:1677.41 E:0.087043 |  And Chris Jones in Marseilles said, will you get drama?
[144.00 - 148.00] P:1664.09 E:0.084139 |  Well, Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton are with me in the commentary position.
[148.00 - 152.00] P:1455.54 E:0.080056 |  And I'll be honest, Alan, I wasn't sure we were going to make it.
[152.00 - 155.00] P:1435.72 E:0.104811 |  That's the hardest I've worked in the last 15 years, by the way.
[155.00 - 159.00] P:1428.82 E:0.095737 |  I've never walked or ran so quick in my life.
[159.00 - 161.00] P:1410.94 E:0.100241 |  Thank goodness I had a cap and some glasses,
[161.00 - 163.00] P:1455.29 E:0.112357 |  and you were pushing in front of us because we'd never got there.
[163.00 - 168.00] P:1612.81 E:0.098817 |  And no surprise to me and you, we actually beat Chris Sutton here.
[168.00 - 171.00] P:1479.91 E:0.087835 |  He was second again, trailing behind us.
[172.00 - 175.00] P:1460.65 E:0.118277 |  Well, once again, you're following Alan.
[177.00 - 180.00] P:1385.73 E:0.107634 |  Listen, if the game is as eventful as our journey here,
[180.00 - 182.00] P:1270.96 E:0.091249 |  then we're going to be in for some ride, aren't we?
[182.00 - 185.00] P:1776.66 E:0.097858 |  Absolutely. There's been quite a few problems for fans getting in.
[185.00 - 187.00] P:1677.34 E:0.095515 |  There's been quite a few problems for everybody getting in.
[187.00 - 189.00] P:1605.95 E:0.087647 |  We have managed to make it.
[189.00 - 192.00] P:1688.82 E:0.095851 |  We do not yet have our correspondent, John Murray.
[192.00 - 194.00] P:1432.00 E:0.095012 |  Our driver, John Murray.
[194.00 - 197.00] P:1679.46 E:0.097363 |  We had to abandon the car to find a way into the stadium.
[197.00 - 200.00] P:1549.16 E:0.094435 |  But I know Chris, if he can't read the teams,
[200.00 - 202.00] P:1661.73 E:0.095837 |  you would want it to be me, wouldn't you?
[202.00 - 204.00] P:1267.64 E:0.088320 |  Yeah, yeah, I think you're...
[204.00 - 206.00] P:1393.24 E:0.098249 |  You're rather than me, yeah.
[206.00 - 208.00] P:1731.24 E:0.091953 |  Absolutely, yeah. Well, that's what's going to happen.
[208.00 - 212.00] P:1673.83 E:0.098431 |  Because Alan has just kindly pointed out the fact that the Liverpool team
[212.00 - 213.00] P:1625.55 E:0.072802 |  has just been announced.
[213.00 - 217.00] P:1686.06 E:0.099103 |  I've got it in front of me. It's in a long list, but we'll manage it, I'm sure.
[217.00 - 219.00] P:1816.44 E:0.084665 |  So obviously, Alison and Gull, the back four.
[219.00 - 221.00] P:1503.21 E:0.101485 |  Alexander-Arnold at right back.
[221.00 - 223.00] P:1425.39 E:0.092071 |  Kanate and Van Dijk in the centre.
[223.00 - 224.00] P:1665.67 E:0.096977 |  Robertson on the left.
[224.00 - 227.00] P:1495.15 E:0.092511 |  You midfield three have for been your Henderson and Tiago
[227.00 - 230.00] P:1441.77 E:0.091048 |  with Diaz, Salah and Mane up front.
[230.00 - 232.00] P:1206.46 E:0.089891 |  No surprises, Alan.
[232.00 - 237.00] P:1369.01 E:0.095863 |  No, I mean, the only question mark to suppose were the injuries.
[237.00 - 241.00] P:1348.86 E:0.089535 |  And training has obviously gone well for Liverpool
[241.00 - 243.00] P:1538.45 E:0.109750 |  and their injuries the last few days.
[243.00 - 247.00] P:1538.12 E:0.093736 |  And if everyone was fit, then that's the team I expected, to be honest, yeah.
[247.00 - 249.00] P:1267.23 E:0.082916 |  Yeah, no great surprises there.
[249.00 - 253.00] P:1750.42 E:0.089155 |  I suppose it's just how fit Fabinho is and Tiago.
[253.00 - 257.00] P:1539.35 E:0.091093 |  I thought, you know, the centre half position was interesting as well.
[257.00 - 258.00] P:1406.13 E:0.099904 |  Kanate getting the nod.
[258.00 - 261.00] P:1716.76 E:0.101743 |  Klopp has trusted Kanate in the Champions League.
[261.00 - 263.00] P:1480.57 E:0.093199 |  Matip has had a great season.
[263.00 - 268.00] P:1314.46 E:0.085274 |  But Kanate made a mistake at the weekend, but he's still gone from tonight.
[268.00 - 273.00] P:1512.23 E:0.093691 |  The question marks over injuries were, of course, Tiago and Fabinho.
[273.00 - 275.00] P:1611.23 E:0.090476 |  This is probably the most obvious question.
[275.00 - 276.00] P:1727.67 E:0.086647 |  I'll ask you all night, Alan.
[276.00 - 278.00] P:1641.46 E:0.098120 |  What a boost to have them available.
[278.00 - 279.00] P:1497.15 E:0.085675 |  Oh, absolutely.
[279.00 - 283.00] P:1502.33 E:0.091665 |  They're two brilliant players, the protection for Fabinho Gibbs.
[283.00 - 287.00] P:1326.98 E:0.103547 |  We all know what Tiago can do on the ball,
[287.00 - 292.00] P:1407.06 E:0.097166 |  and they will need his skill and need his vision that he has
[292.00 - 296.00] P:1629.40 E:0.101853 |  and his ability to play those passes to try and get him behind.
[296.00 - 299.00] P:1639.20 E:0.092905 |  So that's huge news for Liverpool, absolutely.
[299.00 - 301.00] P:1388.25 E:0.085673 |  The only thing that did happen early tonight
[301.00 - 305.00] P:1504.01 E:0.100401 |  was the announcement of the Real Madrid team, which came over an hour ago.
[305.00 - 306.00] P:1733.72 E:0.096016 |  So this is it.
[306.00 - 307.00] P:1456.23 E:0.073013 |  Kortwaring goal.
[307.00 - 312.00] P:1462.84 E:0.089505 |  Carvajal, Militão, Mendi are in there at the back.
[312.00 - 317.00] P:1483.10 E:0.096341 |  The midfield, Cruz, Modric, Casamiro, Valverde starts in there as well.
[317.00 - 322.00] P:1489.12 E:0.089940 |  Obviously, Vinicius Jr. and obviously, Karim Benzema.
[322.00 - 325.00] P:1424.88 E:0.099086 |  And look, Chris, one of the important things about Liverpool
[325.00 - 330.00] P:1441.30 E:0.091231 |  having that midfield 3 fit is because of the midfield 3 of Real Madrid.
[330.00 - 333.00] P:1444.88 E:0.092801 |  You know, the fact that Modric, Casamiro and Cruz
[333.00 - 335.00] P:1395.75 E:0.088130 |  is what you're going up against.
[335.00 - 337.00] P:1280.20 E:0.095930 |  Camavinga can't even get the team.
[337.00 - 341.00] P:1656.52 E:0.107941 |  Yeah, but he's come on and had a real impact, hasn't he, in the Champions League?
[341.00 - 346.00] P:1482.32 E:0.099984 |  It's the same midfield as 2018, the Madrid team, which beat the Liverpool team.
[346.00 - 351.00] P:1544.61 E:0.092319 |  So, listen, it's a great boost for Fabinho and Tiago fit.
[351.00 - 355.00] P:1585.49 E:0.096086 |  I think the interesting thing about the Real Madrid team is the right-hand side.
[355.00 - 359.00] P:1463.39 E:0.097886 |  And that decision Valverde over Rodrigo, I think Valverde
[359.00 - 362.00] P:1473.54 E:0.093153 |  will be a little bit more disciplined and try and protect Carvajal.
[364.00 - 370.00] P:1622.48 E:0.105754 |  Yeah, I think looking at the other side in terms of Vinicius and Trent Alexander-Arnold
[370.00 - 372.00] P:1353.04 E:0.094027 |  I think that's going to be a fascinating battle.
[372.00 - 379.00] P:1331.74 E:0.096623 |  We know, everyone knows how important Trent is in terms of what Liverpool are going forward.
[379.00 - 383.00] P:1452.22 E:0.093231 |  But we also know what Vinicius does for Real Madrid
[383.00 - 387.00] P:1591.91 E:0.102036 |  and the relationship and the understanding that he has with Benzema.
[387.00 - 390.00] P:1520.37 E:0.107074 |  So, there's no doubt they'll be looking at Trent going forward
[390.00 - 393.00] P:1660.31 E:0.085865 |  and leaving Vinicius trying to exploit that space if he does him behind.
[393.00 - 397.00] P:1673.43 E:0.089923 |  We've got some brilliant interviews coming up between now and kick-off.
[397.00 - 399.00] P:1677.68 E:0.104784 |  We're assuming kick-off will happen on time.
[399.00 - 403.00] P:1590.40 E:0.098385 |  The reason I say that is the Liverpool team-buss only arrived about 15 minutes ago
[403.00 - 407.00] P:1468.76 E:0.095913 |  and Jurgen Klopp, when he came off the bus, found the time to give a wave
[407.00 - 410.00] P:1449.76 E:0.094274 |  to some of the fans who were on video screens in front of him.
[410.00 - 413.00] P:1429.31 E:0.096849 |  One of the interviews we'll hear is with Steve McMahonerman, of course.
[413.00 - 416.00] P:1537.50 E:0.097969 |  Former Liverpool and Real Madrid winger.
[416.00 - 420.00] P:1654.98 E:0.095351 |  He'll be telling us all about how much he enjoys watching Vinicius Jr play.
[420.00 - 426.00] P:1532.05 E:0.098452 |  We will also hear from Rafa Benitez on what it's like to manage Karim Benzema and Luca Modric.
[426.00 - 432.00] P:1443.21 E:0.091887 |  But before we really anchor ourselves in the present, we're going to take you to the past
[432.00 - 440.00] P:1416.05 E:0.092990 |  because it was in this city in 1981 when Liverpool won the European Cup by beating Real Madrid.
[440.00 - 444.00] P:1357.86 E:0.088761 |  It was Phil Thompson's third European Cup,
[444.00 - 450.00] P:1488.23 E:0.086817 |  but his first as captain thanks to Alan Kennedy's goal, which beat the great Real Madrid.
[450.00 - 454.00] P:1558.52 E:0.089814 |  They won the trophy, a trophy that Phil couldn't wait to get his hands on.
[454.00 - 456.00] P:1370.06 E:0.086236 |  You can see the size of it.
[456.00 - 467.00] P:1788.60 E:0.070681 |  So as we walked along where it was standing, you just looked at it glinting, gleaming in that night air
[467.00 - 472.00] P:1729.57 E:0.079376 |  and you were just, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and that's all I could think of.
[472.00 - 476.00] P:1804.49 E:0.074769 |  As soon as that final whistle went, that's all I could get out my mind.
[476.00 - 480.00] P:1821.77 E:0.078885 |  Yes, we were all celebrating, hugging each other's staff, players.
[480.00 - 485.00] P:1966.64 E:0.055294 |  We were all over each other.
[485.00 - 487.00] P:1626.63 E:0.073846 |  I could not get this out of my mind.
[487.00 - 493.00] P:1658.99 E:0.061005 |  I'm going to lift the European Cup and we did it, I believe we did it right back then.
[493.00 - 497.00] P:1802.89 E:0.080792 |  The captain went up first and the rest of the players followed.
[497.00 - 503.00] P:1753.19 E:0.075154 |  Now the captain comes up last and sometimes he gets engulfed by all the other players
[503.00 - 512.00] P:1776.54 E:0.062275 |  and you miss out that money shot with that you lifting the cup and I got it in all its glory.
[512.00 - 518.00] P:1762.58 E:0.082684 |  The fella nearly took it away from me, the UEFA guy who was there because he shaked my hand
[518.00 - 521.00] P:1686.70 E:0.090589 |  and he goes to raise it in the air and it's only me.
[521.00 - 525.00] P:1749.73 E:0.086147 |  If people look at my pictures, I've got my two hands going like that.
[525.00 - 534.00] P:1888.39 E:0.056535 |  Give me the cup here and it's just an amazing feeling is that cup.
[534.00 - 539.00] P:1810.45 E:0.062601 |  We always and started off a season we had to be league champions.
[539.00 - 544.00] P:1723.41 E:0.066786 |  That's what our Ronnie Moran, Joe Fagan, Bob Paisley, that was your bread and butter.
[544.00 - 550.00] P:2011.32 E:0.069723 |  We'd finished fifth in the league that year so quite a few weeks before the end of the season
[550.00 - 554.00] P:1666.41 E:0.090318 |  we weren't winning it so the European Cup was taken on greater importance.
[554.00 - 556.00] P:1165.38 E:0.066580 |  We'd won a double, we'd won the league cup as well.
[556.00 - 560.00] P:2077.00 E:0.062590 |  Is it heavy? Because it's so big and shiny.
[560.00 - 568.00] P:1723.71 E:0.075974 |  It is and it is sort of big and heavy but because we've done it in 77-78 you realise when you lift it
[568.00 - 572.00] P:1678.00 E:0.077417 |  and to lift it above your head you have to hold the handles quite low down.
[572.00 - 577.00] P:1900.41 E:0.075639 |  So all this is going through your mind as well as you're looking at it the size of it
[577.00 - 583.00] P:1673.86 E:0.070415 |  because if you're holding too high up you're not going to get that picture with your gleaming face.
[584.00 - 589.00] P:1806.23 E:0.073944 |  So of course you hold it lower down and then you lift it above your head
[589.00 - 599.00] P:1799.07 E:0.077532 |  and that was the moment that you have sort of, you know it's going to be on every front page of every paper back in the UK.
[599.00 - 605.00] P:1945.51 E:0.066970 |  That moment, you know, I enjoyed watching it this morning and anybody could go and watch it
[605.00 - 610.00] P:1817.55 E:0.074819 |  but of course the moments that none of us get to see are the moments that happen when you go back into the dressing room
[610.00 - 618.00] P:1898.66 E:0.065780 |  where the cameras can't follow. So what sticks out in your mind of the celebrations after you get back into the dressing room with that big trophy?
[618.00 - 624.00] P:1850.14 E:0.081776 |  Well it was just wonderful. We could sort of party with the best of them the lads.
[624.00 - 633.00] P:1846.84 E:0.075740 |  What made that team so great was the camaraderie between everybody and the celebration, the dancing, the bouncing about
[633.00 - 637.00] P:1954.55 E:0.090027 |  and it's lovely you see now with social media and players have a mobile phone.
[637.00 - 643.00] P:1879.05 E:0.078686 |  We didn't have that then so it was private. I wish that we would have had mobile phones.
[643.00 - 650.00] P:1916.08 E:0.069442 |  Wish we would have had a camera crew in that dressing room to get those unique photographs
[650.00 - 657.00] P:1672.25 E:0.072226 |  and then we were all back to the hotel and I know we were there with all our family and friends, quite a few of us
[657.00 - 663.00] P:1448.29 E:0.073784 |  but a lot of the players who didn't have many of the family with them, they all went down the Moulin Rouge.
[664.00 - 672.00] P:1426.90 E:0.088122 |  The only thing that could possibly have made Phil Thompson sound better was the first practice of the Champions League anthem.
[672.00 - 676.00] P:1632.24 E:0.095061 |  Dare I ask where the Premier League trophy went in 1995 after you won it Alan?
[676.00 - 681.00] P:1478.32 E:0.098613 |  Well I better tell you because Chris was that drunk he didn't know a clue where we were.
[681.00 - 690.00] P:1470.92 E:0.102513 |  We ended up in a bar restaurant that Kenny had privately booked just in case we'd won it and yeah we ended up there in Preston.
[690.00 - 697.00] P:1397.52 E:0.101913 |  We ended up singing, dancing on the tables with all our families and friends and everything else and it went on a really long time.
[697.00 - 699.00] P:1592.40 E:0.094232 |  Still going anyway.
[699.00 - 700.00] P:1402.83 E:0.080769 |  As you can imagine.
[700.00 - 702.00] P:1369.36 E:0.103632 |  And then Alan the next day, Chris out to this fence.
[704.00 - 707.00] P:1515.81 E:0.100179 |  I wonder where that come from, I never said that you know.
[709.00 - 715.00] P:1509.72 E:0.093979 |  I mean, Chris just imagine what an incredible team you have to be in when you can say what Phil Thompson said there
[715.00 - 721.00] P:1548.39 E:0.098807 |  which is basically, yeah once you've lifted the European Cup a couple of times you learn which is the best place to hoist over your shoulder.
[721.00 - 731.00] P:1414.86 E:0.098245 |  Yeah and the amazing thing is is there are Liverpool fans right at this moment in time who think that this team is a better team than the teams of previous eras.
[731.00 - 735.00] P:1462.23 E:0.093403 |  Alan talked about you know the Paisley era, the Fagan era, the Shankley era.
[735.00 - 744.00] P:1291.20 E:0.094278 |  These are you know Immortals, legends of the club and you know great to look back at those times but this Liverpool team are setting their own standards.
[744.00 - 754.00] P:1397.34 E:0.093420 |  For them to even be spoken about in the same breath of some of those teams, some of those players, I mean Rush and Soonest and Phil Thompson, Hansen, Daglish.
[754.00 - 756.00] P:1633.31 E:0.105404 |  The list goes on and on.
[756.00 - 761.00] P:1335.04 E:0.093005 |  So if this Liverpool team were to win tonight, I mean it's immortality isn't it?
[761.00 - 766.00] P:1353.64 E:0.094670 |  It's like three trophies, three cups in the season, the biggest one that's available tonight.
[766.00 - 786.00] P:1376.69 E:0.094754 |  I mean it's an incredible team but they're all led by their leader, by one man which is obviously Jurgen Klopp and the way he handles himself, the way he presents himself and the way he manages that football club and that squad, the way he does it is absolutely incredible.
[786.00 - 793.00] P:1378.41 E:0.088242 |  There's a lovely moment a couple of minutes ago when Kenny Daglish came into the stadium and got a lovely ovation as you'd expect.
[794.00 - 805.00] P:1572.07 E:0.094753 |  I think even some of these players Alan are making that comparison and I'm talking about the older ones, you know Alan Kennedy said it the other day and Phil Thompson said it to me and actually Jamie Karraker said to us earlier,
[805.00 - 811.00] P:1613.91 E:0.088574 |  if Liverpool win tonight, absolutely put Klopp there with Shankly, absolutely put him with Paisley. I don't think you could find a better compliment.
[811.00 - 825.00] P:1408.44 E:0.094855 |  Absolutely, that's what I mean about immortality, about this group that Klopp has brought to the football club and that Klopp has sort of harnessed in the way that they can do what they've been doing all this season.
[825.00 - 834.00] P:1491.77 E:0.092725 |  Their squad is without doubt been improving year on year, the signings that they have made, their transfer policy has worked for them superbly well.
[834.00 - 843.00] P:1367.96 E:0.093918 |  When you compare to what they had three or four years ago to what they've got now in terms of strength and depth, it's totally different, much, much better.
[843.00 - 853.00] P:1386.88 E:0.092845 |  One player goes out, another one comes in, another top player comes in, but as I said, yeah, that has all come from Jurgen Klopp and what a special manager he is.
[853.00 - 863.00] P:1465.65 E:0.089808 |  You can tell that there have been a lot of problems with fans getting into the stadium because we've got less than an hour to kick off and it's about a quarter full maybe at the moment.
[863.00 - 870.00] P:1700.74 E:0.095153 |  Clearly you can tell where all the posh UEFA people are going to be sitting because there's a massive empty area, completely empty right opposite us.
[870.00 - 890.00] P:1588.11 E:0.091228 |  But what we can see is lots of big, beautiful, billowing Liverpool banners and I'm looking at one right in front of me, an image of Jurgen Klopp which just says, boss, we are going to hear from the Liverpool manager our own interview, great interview that he's done with Juliet Farrington after the latest news on Five Live with Carl Hartley.
[891.00 - 897.00] P:1508.94 E:0.117729 |  Listen on BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[897.00 - 904.00] P:1239.12 E:0.095721 |  The Environment Agency say a super yacht which has sunk in Torquay Harbour had about nine tonnes of diesel on board.
[904.00 - 913.00] P:1544.30 E:0.080837 |  Emergency services are now working to stop the fuel spreading after declaring a major incident. John Donovan is from Devon and Cornwall Fire Service.
[913.00 - 923.00] P:1814.94 E:0.093309 |  What we've done is we've utilised the equipment from the Harbour Master and Environment Agency and our own environmental equipment in order to contain some of the fuel that came out of that vessel, obviously now it's sunk.
[923.00 - 935.00] P:1650.30 E:0.084304 |  And then we've got the Environment Agency and the Harbour Master putting their clean up team and implementing their environmental plan in order to contain that fuel and then remove it from the water within the harbour.
[936.00 - 941.00] P:1289.43 E:0.093185 |  Three more Conservative MPs have revealed that they've submitted letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson.
[941.00 - 951.00] P:1626.69 E:0.077557 |  They join five other Tory-backed benches who have questioned the Prime Minister's authority since the publication of Sue Gray's report into lockdown parties in Downing Street.
[951.00 - 959.00] P:1703.78 E:0.081753 |  The leaders of France and Germany have urged Vladimir Putin to hold serious negotiations with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.
[959.00 - 969.00] P:1478.38 E:0.073428 |  In a phone call at last in 80 minutes Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Schlotz also called for the release of prisoners who were being held at a steelworks in Mariupol.
[969.00 - 979.00] P:1652.18 E:0.084619 |  And after a day of travel disruption at the start of the half-term break in parts of the UK, there's a warning that problems are likely to continue for more than a week.
[979.00 - 988.00] P:1637.65 E:0.077842 |  Families heading abroad for a holiday have expressed their frustration after EasyJet cancelled more than 200 flights and two e-cuts at some of its services.
[988.00 - 996.00] P:1494.21 E:0.069493 |  There have also been long delays at the port of Dover, causing problems for some football fans heading to France for the Champions League final.
[1018.00 - 1020.00] P:1535.87 E:0.099141 |  And from Six Music...
[1020.00 - 1023.00] P:1654.34 E:0.119736 |  Better, happier, more productive...
[1023.00 - 1028.00] P:1631.73 E:0.125005 |  ...revisit Radiohead's groundbreaking album with a deep dive into OK Computer.
[1028.00 - 1031.00] P:1538.89 E:0.124817 |  First time I press record you could just feel the magic was there.
[1031.00 - 1036.00] P:1486.91 E:0.103263 |  Celebrate the legacy of the 90s. Listen on BBC Sounds.
[1036.00 - 1041.00] P:1299.90 E:0.109945 |  This is Five Lives Sport with Steve Crossman.
[1042.00 - 1051.00] P:1662.42 E:0.099241 |  And we're live from the beautiful stade de France for the 2022 Champions League final under an hour to kick off Liverpool vs. Real Madrid.
[1051.00 - 1055.00] P:1518.11 E:0.089562 |  We're just waiting now for the teams to come out and begin their warm-ups.
[1055.00 - 1058.00] P:1511.85 E:0.092356 |  You won't need me to tell you when that happens.
[1058.00 - 1065.00] P:1513.01 E:0.091192 |  Even with thousands of fans struggling to get inside the stadium, there is still enough here already to make plenty of noise.
[1065.00 - 1071.00] P:1536.84 E:0.091056 |  We struggle to get in. I'm delighted to say that our correspondent John Murray has made it in. Good evening.
[1071.00 - 1076.00] P:1142.76 E:0.092379 |  Just had a look outside where it is a little bit fractious actually.
[1076.00 - 1080.00] P:1126.06 E:0.093478 |  Just outside the stadium immediately where we come in.
[1080.00 - 1085.00] P:1266.63 E:0.084936 |  You know, there were police in body armour.
[1085.00 - 1091.00] P:1203.75 E:0.085830 |  There was a little bit of scuffling around going on from them.
[1091.00 - 1098.00] P:1197.50 E:0.094639 |  And in the area immediately where we were, stewards running here and there, which is never a good sign.
[1098.00 - 1102.00] P:1182.93 E:0.088040 |  So, you know, let's just hope everything's OK outside.
[1102.00 - 1108.00] P:1060.93 E:0.088820 |  But there were still a lot of people outside the stadium. What, 10, 15 minutes ago?
[1108.00 - 1115.00] P:1117.13 E:0.088143 |  And, I mean, inside the ground, as you've just said, Steve, still thousands and thousands and thousands of empty seats.
[1115.00 - 1124.00] P:1133.25 E:0.093564 |  It would appear, wouldn't it, from where we're looking here, that the Real Madrid end to our left seems to be more fully occupied than the Liverpool end.
[1124.00 - 1130.00] P:1105.82 E:0.094626 |  I mean, it's slowly filling up, but there are definitely problems outside, you know, whether it's on the roads or outside the stadium.
[1130.00 - 1134.00] P:1196.36 E:0.074102 |  So, let's just hope everything's OK.
[1134.00 - 1141.00] P:1553.72 E:0.092870 |  The first I saw of this was a tweet from Ian Ladiman saying, you know, advice to Liverpool fans, get here as early as you can,
[1141.00 - 1145.00] P:1641.09 E:0.094035 |  because even about two and a half hours ago, it was still a struggle.
[1145.00 - 1151.00] P:1573.90 E:0.092022 |  But let's just hope everybody can get in safely. But what should be, John, a spectacular night?
[1151.00 - 1155.00] P:1329.59 E:0.091708 |  Yeah, well, it does feel as though the place has come alive now, doesn't it?
[1155.00 - 1163.00] P:1351.98 E:0.097954 |  We've been here the last couple of days, a largely empty stadium, watching the various things that happen on the couple of days before a match of this magnitude.
[1163.00 - 1168.00] P:1254.21 E:0.088650 |  But now, suddenly, looking around the place, it's transformed, isn't it?
[1168.00 - 1174.00] P:1396.59 E:0.088897 |  It feels like we're on the verge of the truly big occasion that this final is.
[1174.00 - 1182.00] P:1276.98 E:0.097717 |  And in terms of the team news, just to run through it again for those maybe who've just joined us, I think, you know, the big questions were, would Thiago play?
[1182.00 - 1187.00] P:1249.19 E:0.095950 |  Yes, he is. Would Fabinho be fit? Yes, he is. They're both starting the match.
[1187.00 - 1190.00] P:1289.16 E:0.097037 |  Who would play alongside Van Dijk? It's Kanate.
[1190.00 - 1197.00] P:1037.96 E:0.093611 |  So, the Liverpool team, Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Kanate, Van Dijk and Robertson, then Henderson, Fabinho and Thiago.
[1197.00 - 1202.00] P:1225.04 E:0.090369 |  And then that front line, which really has become the first choice front line of Salah, Mane and Diaz.
[1202.00 - 1206.00] P:1239.15 E:0.087432 |  And the question for Real Madrid, would Alaba be fit? And he is.
[1206.00 - 1212.00] P:1171.81 E:0.090576 |  So, it's Courtois, Carvajal, Militao, Alaba and Mendi, Casamiro with Modric and Croz either side.
[1212.00 - 1216.00] P:1093.83 E:0.087010 |  And then Valverde on the right, Venetius on the left.
[1216.00 - 1219.00] P:1147.93 E:0.090731 |  And the main man, Benzema, through the middle.
[1220.00 - 1229.00] P:1345.81 E:0.098809 |  I mean, you're right, this place is going to be an incredible come kick-off because we've got two very, very good teams, two attacking teams,
[1229.00 - 1238.00] P:1321.80 E:0.101202 |  who want and their fans demand that they go forward and score goals, which hopefully has set up very nice for the neutral like we are.
[1238.00 - 1246.00] P:1473.53 E:0.090938 |  We're going to see a lot of goals, hopefully. It is all set up. It's looking and feeling absolutely magnificent.
[1246.00 - 1252.00] P:1599.02 E:0.092845 |  Sitting here now, it feels really strange to think that 2022 got off to such a bad start for Jurgen Klopp,
[1252.00 - 1257.00] P:1474.57 E:0.092980 |  because he got Covid, his team were 12 points behind Manchester City in the Premier League.
[1257.00 - 1263.00] P:1629.72 E:0.093857 |  He recovered, of course, then they pushed City all the way in the Premier League, but he's been telling Juliet Behrington.
[1263.00 - 1271.00] P:1398.19 E:0.085715 |  It was at that point, back in January, that his side set themselves a private project that will end in Paris.
[1272.00 - 1276.00] P:1270.49 E:0.095994 |  We called it that time, we are men on a mission without telling anybody.
[1276.00 - 1284.00] P:1350.94 E:0.067244 |  And we were, we are. So that's cool, that's a special group, you know that.
[1284.00 - 1288.00] P:1304.65 E:0.090830 |  And now we have, and as long as you are healthy, that's a good thing about life.
[1288.00 - 1291.00] P:1643.15 E:0.075684 |  There's always a next chance, there's always an next opportunity.
[1291.00 - 1294.00] P:1386.67 E:0.085449 |  And for us now, in a specific case, it's a German League final.
[1294.00 - 1298.00] P:1389.14 E:0.077588 |  So if we would be here today and would still suffer because of the weekend, we would be a bit dumb.
[1298.00 - 1300.00] P:1668.19 E:0.109446 |  Do you feel that Real Madrid know you're on this mission as well?
[1300.00 - 1304.00] P:1616.42 E:0.071429 |  Because it's a different proposition, isn't it? It's a different challenge.
[1304.00 - 1311.00] P:1456.39 E:0.087883 |  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Real Madrid is. So we can speak two hours about Real Madrid, the strength, the quality, the history, all these kind of things.
[1311.00 - 1312.00] P:1405.74 E:0.106591 |  We kind of don't have that time.
[1312.00 - 1315.00] P:1159.40 E:0.105411 |  There are no problems, and the experience of the players.
[1315.00 - 1320.00] P:1337.63 E:0.093053 |  And if you look at the last 10 years, I don't know how often Real Madrid is there on the winners board.
[1320.00 - 1323.00] P:1492.41 E:0.084335 |  But in the last five years, we are our third time there.
[1323.00 - 1328.00] P:1731.16 E:0.085999 |  So we have our experience as well. We are as well not a much changed group since then.
[1328.00 - 1334.00] P:1521.07 E:0.083885 |  We improved a lot since then. For us, it was an important night that didn't feel that night like this.
[1334.00 - 1337.00] P:1138.33 E:0.086215 |  Of course, I would have wished we would have won it. It would have been important as well.
[1337.00 - 1341.00] P:1618.34 E:0.085966 |  But like this, we got a chance to learn from it. We did improve.
[1341.00 - 1344.00] P:1631.39 E:0.081905 |  Back a year later, this is absolutely crazy story already.
[1344.00 - 1349.00] P:1505.87 E:0.079876 |  And in 10, 15, 20 years, people would say, oh, that was it like this, and I won it like that.
[1349.00 - 1351.00] P:1572.54 E:0.088253 |  So that's really special. And now we are there again.
[1351.00 - 1355.00] P:1670.94 E:0.087815 |  That's pretty special as well. So I can't wait to get there and play the game.
[1355.00 - 1361.00] P:1616.18 E:0.068155 |  Knowing that the opposition is pretty much the Champions League team of the last decade
[1361.00 - 1364.00] P:1495.28 E:0.079033 |  with the Champions League manager of the last 20 years.
[1364.00 - 1369.00] P:1408.83 E:0.066969 |  So yes, that's tough, but we will give it a try anyway.
[1369.00 - 1373.00] P:1405.77 E:0.095837 |  That's Jürgen Klopp as if that needs any explaining.
[1373.00 - 1379.00] P:1609.48 E:0.091086 |  In the media, Alan, you know, managers and players do often talk about this idea of taking every game as it comes.
[1379.00 - 1381.00] P:1586.70 E:0.094850 |  But then you listen to that, and you know they don't.
[1381.00 - 1387.00] P:1592.27 E:0.096015 |  You know, there has to be an ambition. There has to be a coherent plan that you can work towards.
[1387.00 - 1391.00] P:1659.60 E:0.105018 |  Well, you've always got a plan A, but it's hugely important that you have a plan B and C.
[1391.00 - 1398.00] P:1705.04 E:0.092269 |  Just in case that doesn't work. You know you're going to get injuries, particularly in Liverpool's case.
[1398.00 - 1403.00] P:1656.97 E:0.097350 |  Because, I mean, what, two weeks ago, 10 days ago, they could still win all four.
[1403.00 - 1408.00] P:1609.33 E:0.101802 |  So it was inevitable they were going to get injuries, and they were going to be questioning marks like they were
[1408.00 - 1410.00] P:1422.27 E:0.093800 |  with some of the players this evening.
[1410.00 - 1415.00] P:1471.08 E:0.106632 |  So, yeah, you've got to look at things differently as much as you'd want to pick the same team.
[1415.00 - 1420.00] P:1544.58 E:0.098012 |  And you have your favourite team or what you believe to be your best team.
[1420.00 - 1426.00] P:1490.32 E:0.095138 |  You can't always put that out. And that hasn't harmed Liverpool too much this season because of their squad.
[1426.00 - 1432.00] P:1653.44 E:0.098831 |  Yeah, Chia's won Boo's Nail, I think, there when the Real Madrid players came running out of the tunnel,
[1432.00 - 1437.00] P:1566.15 E:0.093031 |  which tells the story that more Real fans so far have been able to get into the stadium than Liverpool fans.
[1437.00 - 1446.00] P:1523.16 E:0.090916 |  Chris, what Jurgen Klopp said there is, he said, when it comes to finals, now they feel there's always the next chance or the next opportunity.
[1446.00 - 1453.00] P:1624.23 E:0.095212 |  I wonder if that really shows how far they've come. Because I don't think in 2018 they would have thought big deal Champions League final,
[1453.00 - 1455.00] P:1777.29 E:0.100817 |  but we'll be back here in a year, two years.
[1455.00 - 1462.00] P:1524.64 E:0.101290 |  No, I think that's very fair. When you think about, you know, when he first took the job, the consistency they are showing now
[1462.00 - 1466.00] P:1573.75 E:0.091543 |  and winning trophies and getting to major finals is quite incredible.
[1466.00 - 1469.00] P:1505.78 E:0.099237 |  I don't think anybody believed that that would necessarily happen.
[1469.00 - 1476.00] P:1558.92 E:0.099687 |  And, you know, the issue for Liverpool this season, their standards have been so high, but Manchester City in the first half of the season
[1476.00 - 1484.00] P:1583.84 E:0.094590 |  were so good and so consistent. And yet Liverpool, I think they only dropped four points in 18 games after they lost to Leicester
[1484.00 - 1489.00] P:1610.30 E:0.099662 |  and then they drew against Chelsea early in the new year and they've pushed Manchester City all the way.
[1489.00 - 1497.00] P:1605.39 E:0.090185 |  But to be sitting here with two trophies in the back already this season and they have breezed in many respects into the Champions League final,
[1497.00 - 1503.00] P:1643.58 E:0.094373 |  unlike Real Madrid. But I feel this is going to be Liverpool's night. I really do.
[1503.00 - 1507.00] P:1583.79 E:0.086467 |  You know, if Liverpool turn up, which I expect them to do, and if they're ruthless,
[1507.00 - 1513.00] P:1625.06 E:0.095023 |  and you know, that's been the issue with teams who have played against Real Madrid, the likes of PSG, the likes of Chelsea,
[1513.00 - 1518.00] P:1525.81 E:0.086619 |  the likes of Manchester City, they've had chances or they had big chances. They didn't take them.
[1518.00 - 1520.00] P:1492.53 E:0.098520 |  Liverpool take the chance tonight. They will win this game.
[1520.00 - 1526.00] P:1439.31 E:0.093768 |  Tell you one thing that we've not really mentioned over the course of the last couple of days of all of the things that we've spoken about
[1526.00 - 1534.00] P:1194.64 E:0.086246 |  is that when we talk about the development of Liverpool under Klopp after Kiev back in 2018,
[1534.00 - 1540.00] P:1418.88 E:0.086786 |  if you remember, he as the coach had lost six finals in a row. Do you remember that?
[1540.00 - 1542.00] P:1480.21 E:0.088709 |  Yeah. Both at Brusea Dortmund and at Liverpool.
[1542.00 - 1551.00] P:1336.83 E:0.076411 |  Now he's won five finals in a row with Liverpool from Madrid onward in the Champions League.
[1551.00 - 1557.00] P:1189.61 E:0.085364 |  But what I think is interesting, when you look at those finals, they've all been really tight affairs.
[1557.00 - 1565.00] P:1204.95 E:0.083263 |  Three of them have gone to penalties. One went to extra time. The only one they won in 90 minutes was the Champions League final against Tottenham.
[1565.00 - 1575.00] P:1255.70 E:0.081314 |  And actually, they've achieved this great thing this season. Rare feet to win the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup.
[1575.00 - 1578.00] P:1252.95 E:0.071069 |  They've not actually scored in a final yet.
[1578.00 - 1580.00] P:1429.28 E:0.097824 |  Well, that means they're due, John.
[1580.00 - 1583.00] P:1593.07 E:0.111114 |  Well, you can look at it that way. An easier type by-law.
[1583.00 - 1585.00] P:1361.38 E:0.098376 |  They won two cups without scoring a goal.
[1585.00 - 1592.00] P:1486.85 E:0.084778 |  I wouldn't be as confident as Chris is in terms of Liverpool simply because it's Real Madrid.
[1592.00 - 1594.00] P:1395.82 E:0.077245 |  Look how they've got to this final.
[1594.00 - 1597.00] P:1501.04 E:0.078868 |  Look, they've come from behind.
[1597.00 - 1601.00] P:1478.50 E:0.084495 |  They've so many people have doubted them and written them off.
[1601.00 - 1607.00] P:1498.26 E:0.093378 |  I know that they've had their home to rely on to go and get results in the Bernabeal.
[1607.00 - 1609.00] P:1342.40 E:0.084730 |  But they've done it.
[1609.00 - 1614.00] P:1487.30 E:0.094131 |  PSG, Chelsea, City. It's not a fluke that this team is here.
[1614.00 - 1619.00] P:1563.49 E:0.103588 |  This team, you cannot say that this Liverpool team will go and breeze all over them.
[1619.00 - 1621.00] P:1492.89 E:0.095250 |  Because I don't think that will happen.
[1621.00 - 1628.00] P:1437.09 E:0.089064 |  And I think with the stats that you've just given in terms of those finals, I think this could go again all the way.
[1628.00 - 1632.00] P:1602.96 E:0.094845 |  I really do. I really think it could go all the way and it could be a long evening.
[1632.00 - 1635.00] P:1473.00 E:0.097891 |  I think the set-up of both teams is really fascinating as well.
[1635.00 - 1638.00] P:1574.89 E:0.105861 |  Because I think Real Madrid will be really cagey here.
[1638.00 - 1642.00] P:1725.52 E:0.084071 |  Against PSG against Chelsea against Manchester City.
[1642.00 - 1647.00] P:1655.42 E:0.096654 |  Real Madrid had less possession. They gave up the possession.
[1647.00 - 1652.00] P:1525.73 E:0.094592 |  I expect Liverpool to really push, press them high, try and dominate the game.
[1652.00 - 1655.00] P:1431.76 E:0.082068 |  And then the game at the weekend against Wolves.
[1655.00 - 1658.00] P:1524.32 E:0.093613 |  Wolves caused Liverpool all sorts of problems.
[1658.00 - 1661.00] P:1685.38 E:0.097776 |  We've talked about the Liverpool high line all season.
[1661.00 - 1663.00] P:1663.07 E:0.105948 |  And that will be the Real Madrid chance.
[1663.00 - 1668.00] P:1567.79 E:0.099104 |  Benzema with his movement and Vinicius Jr. that right hand, Liverpool right hand side.
[1668.00 - 1670.00] P:1411.33 E:0.105612 |  We talked about Trent going forward.
[1670.00 - 1672.00] P:1554.90 E:0.091558 |  But will he be exposed going the other way?
[1672.00 - 1676.00] P:1378.04 E:0.082794 |  And if you talk about destiny, you know, it's funny, isn't it?
[1676.00 - 1679.00] P:1523.74 E:0.084031 |  I had quite a fraught journey to the stadium.
[1679.00 - 1683.00] P:1460.53 E:0.086754 |  And with Juliet, our producer in the car, I said to her,
[1683.00 - 1686.00] P:1514.58 E:0.094944 |  this is going to be extra time in penalties, isn't it?
[1686.00 - 1688.00] P:1581.27 E:0.080088 |  After all this.
[1688.00 - 1691.00] P:1660.81 E:0.108160 |  Well, if you had bullied you way in a little bit more in the traffic,
[1691.00 - 1693.00] P:1473.88 E:0.091770 |  it would have been a lot earlier.
[1693.00 - 1696.00] P:1243.57 E:0.092304 |  That's a good thing, isn't it? I'm not a bully.
[1696.00 - 1699.00] P:1817.56 E:0.096382 |  Oh, you should have seen me, John. I was like a bulldozer.
[1699.00 - 1702.00] P:1810.08 E:0.109615 |  I gave Alan me my glasses so people didn't know he was.
[1702.00 - 1704.00] P:1691.91 E:0.092687 |  Just got my head down, didn't I?
[1704.00 - 1707.00] P:1554.40 E:0.103832 |  You were fantastic. It just said follow the leader and I followed you
[1707.00 - 1709.00] P:1522.27 E:0.107557 |  and it was straight through, no problem.
[1709.00 - 1713.00] P:1585.92 E:0.110647 |  It didn't help that we had a little Miss Daisy driving us on the way here, though, didn't it?
[1713.00 - 1716.00] P:1446.40 E:0.085976 |  Oh, no.
[1716.00 - 1717.00] P:1568.13 E:0.100587 |  I should have known.
[1717.00 - 1721.00] P:1757.86 E:0.109059 |  No, in fact, you can come on front of a school and then you can go with that.
[1721.00 - 1725.00] P:1623.34 E:0.090934 |  No, no, you're far too nice as a driver, John. Far too nice.
[1725.00 - 1730.00] P:1572.84 E:0.099282 |  Yeah, but I'm looking at that as a positive quality.
[1730.00 - 1733.00] P:1669.63 E:0.099197 |  Well, John Murray may or may not be the best driver of the last 20 years,
[1733.00 - 1738.00] P:1783.57 E:0.089425 |  but we just had Jurgen Klopp say Carlo Ancelotti is the best manager of the last two decades.
[1738.00 - 1742.00] P:1776.68 E:0.094793 |  John, forgive me, I'm going to read a little bit of a list here before asking you a question,
[1742.00 - 1744.00] P:1636.70 E:0.095336 |  because we can go back further than 20 years.
[1744.00 - 1747.00] P:1777.78 E:0.090783 |  Some great names have won this competition.
[1747.00 - 1754.00] P:1607.75 E:0.096927 |  Klopp, Mourinho, Guardiola, Ferguson, Paisley, Kroiff, Hankers, Lippi, Fagan, Busby.
[1754.00 - 1758.00] P:1425.22 E:0.091142 |  But after tonight, Ancelotti can outstack them all.
[1758.00 - 1760.00] P:1359.91 E:0.094234 |  Yes, he can.
[1760.00 - 1763.00] P:1491.41 E:0.108362 |  And I mean, you'd be right that the pinnacle wouldn't be.
[1763.00 - 1770.00] P:1714.40 E:0.110192 |  We'll talk about that in a moment, because coming out now, Liverpool's players into the stadium,
[1770.00 - 1775.00] P:1815.10 E:0.097621 |  they're sprinting out, and they're applauding to the Liverpool supporters
[1775.00 - 1782.00] P:1487.73 E:0.094127 |  who are packing the stands now to our right and waving their flags and their scarves with an extra fervour.
[1782.00 - 1788.00] P:1230.02 E:0.087356 |  And I mean, they have literally burst into the stadium there, the Liverpool players.
[1788.00 - 1792.00] P:1627.39 E:0.102696 |  Yeah, they already look up for it. And to be honest, having spent so long on the bus,
[1792.00 - 1795.00] P:1702.97 E:0.090356 |  like I know they did, that's probably how I would have done it as well.
[1795.00 - 1797.00] P:1442.61 E:0.083276 |  I'm glad they look up for it, Steve.
[1797.00 - 1799.00] P:1491.56 E:0.070697 |  Come on!
[1799.00 - 1803.00] P:1756.05 E:0.098573 |  You didn't sound too up for it when we were trying to get in the stadium, mate.
[1803.00 - 1807.00] P:1455.55 E:0.093714 |  Yeah, but I'm here with a microphone, you know, it's quite important for them, isn't it?
[1807.00 - 1809.00] P:1653.69 E:0.087920 |  They look super up for it, Chris.
[1809.00 - 1813.00] P:1778.03 E:0.093866 |  I've just realised we've got Julianne Laurent just sitting above us here.
[1813.00 - 1817.00] P:1611.38 E:0.095510 |  He's towering over us, which is the first time he's done that to anyone in his life.
[1817.00 - 1824.00] P:1609.63 E:0.090143 |  He is going to be with us a little bit later. But let's talk a bit more then, Chris, about Carlo Ancelotti.
[1824.00 - 1833.00] P:1589.62 E:0.084236 |  I mean, the job that he's doing here, Tony Cruz said, he sometimes randomly asks one of the players for a piece of tactical advice.
[1833.00 - 1839.00] P:1550.53 E:0.084993 |  Now, you've got to be really confident in yourself and your reputation to do that with one of your players.
[1839.00 - 1843.00] P:1642.75 E:0.093877 |  You have, but I mean, you know, they are top players, you know, he's inclusive.
[1843.00 - 1854.00] P:1558.97 E:0.089323 |  You look at his record over the years, his one, what, five titles in five different, or the five top European league, which is incredible.
[1854.00 - 1859.00] P:1653.09 E:0.091257 |  His record against Klopp, I find really interesting, because had I not actually looked this up,
[1859.00 - 1864.00] P:1534.01 E:0.085200 |  I would have thought that Klopp would have had the edge over Ancelotti, but Ancelotti just edges at ten games.
[1864.00 - 1868.00] P:1510.57 E:0.094643 |  Ancelotti's won four, Klopp's won three, and three draws, of course.
[1868.00 - 1874.00] P:1499.52 E:0.083391 |  And with, you could say, lesser, lesser sides with the likes of Napoli and Eviton.
[1874.00 - 1878.00] P:1551.15 E:0.089226 |  So he knows how to beat Jürgen Klopp, which makes it even more fascinating.
[1878.00 - 1888.00] P:1521.27 E:0.079469 |  What can you add to Ancelotti in the career that he's had, where he's been successes mostly followed him?
[1888.00 - 1894.00] P:1482.56 E:0.089309 |  You have to have a special ability to do that and to go into huge football clubs,
[1894.00 - 1899.00] P:1442.80 E:0.108034 |  and they don't get much better than this one he's got here tonight in Real Madrid.
[1899.00 - 1902.00] P:1431.90 E:0.105550 |  I mean, they do it slightly different to everyone else.
[1902.00 - 1906.00] P:1427.65 E:0.101272 |  We've seen managers sack when they've won the biggest trophies there.
[1906.00 - 1912.00] P:1604.04 E:0.090345 |  So for him to have gone there and had the success, for him to be in this position again,
[1912.00 - 1919.00] P:1575.36 E:0.088780 |  with a really good opportunity of winning this competition again, tells you all you need to know about it.
[1919.00 - 1924.00] P:1447.19 E:0.095883 |  And now the white flags are waving in the end to our left, the white and lilac flags.
[1924.00 - 1932.00] P:1365.80 E:0.091611 |  And the Israel Madrid players who enter the arena next and begin to go through their warm-up routine.
[1932.00 - 1934.00] P:1531.98 E:0.096418 |  It does tend to be a little bit shorter, doesn't it, for the big finals,
[1934.00 - 1939.00] P:1379.18 E:0.093379 |  because we've obviously got an opening ceremony to come with Camilla Cabello.
[1939.00 - 1944.00] P:1388.88 E:0.081808 |  So that means that there is slightly less time for the players to warm up than they might normally do.
[1944.00 - 1949.00] P:1719.37 E:0.084355 |  When Camilla Cabello comes out, I'm sure she will go very well down here
[1949.00 - 1953.00] P:1815.53 E:0.083941 |  because she's got a very, very big reputation, not a big football fan.
[1953.00 - 1959.00] P:1890.20 E:0.083116 |  We've learned in the last few days, but what she isn't is the new wave band Indochin.
[1959.00 - 1965.00] P:1694.27 E:0.082384 |  And the reason why they're not particularly popular at the moment is their concert here in front of 90,000 fans
[1965.00 - 1969.00] P:1742.84 E:0.090581 |  meant the pitch had to be relayed just two days ago.
[1969.00 - 1973.00] P:1799.53 E:0.080589 |  Jürgen Klopp was not particularly impressed with that, but right now he is standing on it,
[1973.00 - 1980.00] P:1605.67 E:0.079048 |  doing what Jürgen Klopp does. Red Train is on, big black cap with his back to the Liverpool players,
[1980.00 - 1983.00] P:1632.72 E:0.075079 |  watching Real Madrid warm up.
[1983.00 - 1984.00] P:1560.48 E:0.079216 |  They're orange, his trainers.
[1984.00 - 1988.00] P:1758.08 E:0.083663 |  Alright, Chris, is this because I left you behind? Is this what it was?
[1988.00 - 1990.00] P:1833.37 E:0.105674 |  I prioritised Alan and I left you.
[1990.00 - 1992.00] P:1671.42 E:0.089024 |  But the details important, they are orange.
[1992.00 - 1995.00] P:1891.91 E:0.084703 |  You never left him behind, by the way, he couldn't keep up.
[1996.00 - 2002.00] P:1520.86 E:0.087752 |  Shame on me. Must have been after he was crammed into the back of the car.
[2002.00 - 2004.00] P:1258.63 E:0.089772 |  He probably couldn't move after that.
[2004.00 - 2009.00] P:1906.67 E:0.091859 |  Your knees were up to your chin in the car, Chris, so I hope you're feeling okay.
[2009.00 - 2011.00] P:1767.38 E:0.110734 |  Yeah, Shearer was slow off the mark there, wasn't he?
[2011.00 - 2017.00] P:1848.20 E:0.087836 |  Honestly, it felt like 95 all over again. I was grabbing hold of his shirt and dragging along with me.
[2017.00 - 2020.00] P:1927.73 E:0.093618 |  Come on, Chris, keep up with us. There's something special going on.
[2020.00 - 2027.00] P:1767.72 E:0.083779 |  See, what you've learned, Chris, is after what I've done for Alan tonight, if you come for me, there you go, this is what happens.
[2027.00 - 2032.00] P:1831.30 E:0.086872 |  Let's speak to some fans, shall we, because as we've been telling you, it looks like some Liverpool fans have struggled to get in.
[2032.00 - 2039.00] P:1704.69 E:0.085164 |  I can tell you it's starting to fill up just a little bit, just over 35 minutes to go until kick-off.
[2039.00 - 2046.00] P:1799.34 E:0.088931 |  It isn't easy to speak to a Liverpool fan anyway at the moment, because of course so many are here inside or trying to get inside the stadium.
[2046.00 - 2053.00] P:1681.16 E:0.086013 |  But some people do have to work, some haven't been able to cross the channel, and that includes the Liverpool band, the Ragamuffins.
[2053.00 - 2058.00] P:1766.36 E:0.083669 |  The Ragamuffins have just come off stage at Hotel Anfield, getting a load of the fans in the mood for the final.
[2058.00 - 2063.00] P:1773.86 E:0.097072 |  Delighted to see a lead singer, Dave Jackson has joined us now. Good evening, Dave, how are you feeling?
[2063.00 - 2065.00] P:1464.42 E:0.094709 |  Are you doing? Are you doing? Are you doing?
[2065.00 - 2067.00] P:1053.14 E:0.086009 |  No, it's been so long.
[2067.00 - 2072.00] P:1595.74 E:0.088985 |  Dude, oh, sorry, I think we possibly heard a bit of bad language in the background there.
[2072.00 - 2075.00] P:1628.93 E:0.096512 |  I wasn't, certainly wasn't me.
[2075.00 - 2081.00] P:1590.51 E:0.081408 |  I knew it wasn't you. I knew it wasn't you. What song got the crowd going the best tonight?
[2082.00 - 2086.00] P:1378.13 E:0.100997 |  Do you know what? A Leia Leia Leia is always a winner, I think.
[2086.00 - 2093.00] P:1293.22 E:0.093255 |  But the Shimmichat song that we've just put out, I'll tell you what, that actually bangs, that actually bangs when we play that.
[2093.00 - 2099.00] P:1396.68 E:0.094490 |  So, yeah, that's, I mean, I think everybody loves to cut here, always, as Chris Sutton will.
[2099.00 - 2107.00] P:1296.85 E:0.084177 |  So, yeah, certainly, that's it. Those kind of songs certainly make a big impression with the crowd.
[2107.00 - 2112.00] P:1487.28 E:0.084262 |  We're going to hear a little blast of that, Dave, then. This is Simi Simi Simi.
[2138.00 - 2143.00] P:1675.75 E:0.100198 |  I love that. I absolutely love that. I mean, what is it like, Dave?
[2143.00 - 2145.00] P:1334.18 E:0.082450 |  Go on, go on.
[2145.00 - 2149.00] P:1220.49 E:0.085681 |  I was going, that must have been sped up. I wish I could have that note.
[2151.00 - 2154.00] P:1555.40 E:0.095078 |  What's it like when you hear the cops singing a song you've written?
[2154.00 - 2161.00] P:1363.08 E:0.098209 |  It's possibly the biggest thrill in music that I mean, I mean, we've done, I mean, we're playing glass to me for the first time this year.
[2161.00 - 2174.00] P:1398.27 E:0.088206 |  But as a football fan, I mean, the thrill we had when our C-Senior record was played after the final in Madrid was, I mean, it was possibly bigger than anything I've ever had in music.
[2174.00 - 2182.00] P:1299.97 E:0.088382 |  And it's, you know, we've done alright, you know, it's been too badly. So that was it. That was magic, absolutely magic.
[2182.00 - 2187.00] P:1361.98 E:0.084371 |  So, yeah, we're showing, you know, we're showing, I think it's on a couple of records now.
[2187.00 - 2195.00] P:1549.03 E:0.093641 |  We've done, we've just done a full album called Unity's Strength, which you can find on all good places and all the money we get from the Liverpool songs that we do.
[2195.00 - 2203.00] P:1445.19 E:0.085830 |  We donate to the fan-supporting food banks, organisations as well. So we're trying to do some, we start putting it back.
[2204.00 - 2208.00] P:1498.10 E:0.088640 |  Dave, Dave, it's Chris here. Dave, do you play a bit of football yourself?
[2209.00 - 2212.00] P:1171.67 E:0.096744 |  I do. I would say, I'd like to say...
[2212.00 - 2216.00] P:1510.08 E:0.091157 |  Who would you modulate yourself on as a Liverpool team, the current Liverpool team?
[2216.00 - 2222.00] P:1252.45 E:0.086208 |  I'd probably say, I'd like to say to the Argo, but I'd probably say...
[2225.00 - 2226.00] P:1430.71 E:0.120528 |  You're having a laugh on you.
[2226.00 - 2231.00] P:1375.20 E:0.090739 |  Yeah, I am having a laugh, yeah mate. I'd say, when I, we had Steve McMahon, we had Steve McMahon down here.
[2231.00 - 2234.00] P:1407.69 E:0.101576 |  When I told him we used to play sense of midfield, he laughed at my face.
[2234.00 - 2237.00] P:1501.91 E:0.095774 |  He said, there's no way, you would have lasted five minutes on our day.
[2237.00 - 2241.00] P:1468.82 E:0.083756 |  And I'll say what I think he's right, you know. So, it's one of those, isn't it?
[2242.00 - 2244.00] P:1546.73 E:0.086801 |  I think he's done your favour five minutes.
[2246.00 - 2248.00] P:1607.35 E:0.098725 |  30 seconds, Alan, 30 seconds.
[2250.00 - 2255.00] P:1612.25 E:0.087953 |  I'll tell you what, Dave, Chris might be going after everybody tonight, but I know he fancies Liverpool.
[2255.00 - 2257.00] P:1759.81 E:0.092349 |  He said he fancies Liverpool. How confident are you?
[2258.00 - 2265.00] P:1345.99 E:0.087743 |  I don't want to say very confident. I was really confident before the final image earlier.
[2265.00 - 2273.00] P:1439.34 E:0.084410 |  But not quite as confident as then, but I think we've still got more than enough quality to sort of hurry them.
[2273.00 - 2277.00] P:1543.05 E:0.094640 |  We've got the kind of pressure that can cause them to huge, huge problems.
[2278.00 - 2286.00] P:1293.97 E:0.083334 |  Obviously they've got to put some of the break with Rodrigo and Venetius, but I think that if we play through our potential on the pitch,
[2286.00 - 2290.00] P:1589.29 E:0.093285 |  through our potential or close to our potential, we should be able to take the game away from them.
[2290.00 - 2296.00] P:1495.40 E:0.083893 |  And even with the comebacks that they've had this season, I think we should still have enough to beat them.
[2298.00 - 2303.00] P:1739.29 E:0.081484 |  Dave, before we let you go, you did just mention it in your first answer about the work you do with Foodbank,
[2303.00 - 2307.00] P:1660.08 E:0.085137 |  but just tell us a little bit more about that because that's such an important gesture.
[2307.00 - 2312.00] P:1665.26 E:0.085777 |  I think especially now, people are living with a cost of living crisis. It's a really difficult time.
[2312.00 - 2322.00] P:1607.15 E:0.082923 |  Obviously you don't get the same money from charity signals that you used to, but it just feels like the right thing to do.
[2322.00 - 2329.00] P:1498.68 E:0.085777 |  If we put a song out that's making a huge impression on the car and around the services and everything like that,
[2329.00 - 2334.00] P:1714.51 E:0.084617 |  if we can do some good with it, then it just feels like the right thing to do.
[2334.00 - 2341.00] P:1404.04 E:0.088919 |  So, Fan Supporting Foodbanks is an organisation that's set up by an Everton fan, Dave Kelly, and a Liverpool fan,
[2341.00 - 2349.00] P:1619.77 E:0.078379 |  the MP for West Darby, Ian Byrne, and they set it up and now there's branches in Newcastle.
[2349.00 - 2354.00] P:1600.24 E:0.083260 |  Sorry about that. There's branches in Newcastle, there's ones in Manchester,
[2354.00 - 2358.00] P:1608.42 E:0.082395 |  and we actually donated one of the last Royalty checks that we got.
[2358.00 - 2363.00] P:1453.19 E:0.091083 |  We donated three grand to the guys who have the equivalent foodbanks in Manchester
[2363.00 - 2369.00] P:1356.10 E:0.087384 |  because it's something that affects everyone around the country, and as their motto says, hunger just wears club colours,
[2369.00 - 2373.00] P:1478.63 E:0.079748 |  and that's like an incredibly accurate assessment of it.
[2373.00 - 2379.00] P:1384.05 E:0.083168 |  So, we're just trying to do our best, and if we can try and help people a little bit, then we'll do it.
[2379.00 - 2385.00] P:1502.15 E:0.083215 |  Tom and Dave, that's a really important gesture, so well done to you, and good luck for tonight.
[2385.00 - 2390.00] P:1353.72 E:0.075934 |  Thank you very much. We'll have a blast. I hope you have a blast over there as well.
[2390.00 - 2392.00] P:1333.59 E:0.058965 |  To his side, thank you.
[2392.00 - 2397.00] P:1185.96 E:0.084234 |  Well, we're still concerned about what's happening outside the stadium.
[2397.00 - 2407.00] P:1086.89 E:0.086852 |  I see that the French radio station RMC are reporting that some ticketless fans have tried to get into the stadium.
[2407.00 - 2413.00] P:1054.22 E:0.088027 |  They say Liverpool fans, that's what French radio RMC are reporting,
[2413.00 - 2419.00] P:1233.86 E:0.085388 |  and that they describe the situation as the stewards briefly being overwhelmed.
[2419.00 - 2429.00] P:1148.96 E:0.085237 |  So, that is one thing, and our colleague Kelly Cates, who is here, has said it's absolutely shambolic of the Stade de France.
[2429.00 - 2436.00] P:1226.83 E:0.084315 |  She says no way in, no way of knowing which way to go, and says it has the potential to be very dangerous.
[2436.00 - 2438.00] P:1463.28 E:0.080767 |  Chris, did you witness a little bit of this?
[2438.00 - 2445.00] P:1440.08 E:0.090382 |  Yeah, well, we jumped out of the car on the motorway, or whatever you call the roads over here,
[2445.00 - 2451.00] P:1519.95 E:0.094698 |  and then coming in, there was a lot of shoving and pushing, and there were fans trying to get through,
[2451.00 - 2455.00] P:1445.86 E:0.086999 |  because there were ticket checks, and there were fans trying to get through,
[2455.00 - 2458.00] P:1331.92 E:0.090917 |  and some of the fans didn't have tickets, and they were the ones causing problems,
[2458.00 - 2466.00] P:1321.62 E:0.091299 |  and they were turning around and trying to come out, and it was quite harrowing for a lot of people that,
[2466.00 - 2470.00] P:1395.59 E:0.088083 |  and it was taking too long to get through, far too long.
[2471.00 - 2476.00] P:1502.54 E:0.092598 |  Hopefully, it is not going to go in this direction, and the moment there is no reason to think it will go in this direction,
[2476.00 - 2482.00] P:1498.57 E:0.085894 |  but it's hard not, John, to think of echoes of Wembley Stadium in the final of the Euros.
[2482.00 - 2484.00] P:1547.18 E:0.080292 |  It is very difficult not to immediately think of that.
[2484.00 - 2490.00] P:1088.15 E:0.086571 |  Yeah, it is, and as I say, we've all experienced it tonight,
[2490.00 - 2497.00] P:1145.28 E:0.088036 |  and it definitely had a feeling that things were not right, and that it was quite uncomfortable.
[2497.00 - 2501.00] P:1207.04 E:0.092856 |  And as I say, one of the big indicators was the way that the police and the stewards were reacting.
[2501.00 - 2505.00] P:1305.71 E:0.084812 |  I mean, that tells you that things aren't going as they should do.
[2505.00 - 2511.00] P:1494.71 E:0.095074 |  But the big issue in this is there were a lot of fans trying to get in who didn't have tickets,
[2511.00 - 2517.00] P:1368.85 E:0.084808 |  and there is an element of responsibility from these fans not to try and get in and do the right thing.
[2517.00 - 2525.00] P:1146.27 E:0.082915 |  Steve, James, Ollie from ESPN has just come inside from outside. I think he's here to talk to us now.
[2525.00 - 2529.00] P:1667.92 E:0.089243 |  James, thank you for coming on. What did you know? What did you see?
[2529.00 - 2535.00] P:1068.95 E:0.084662 |  Yeah, so I came in about 45 minutes ago. I got here about 45 minutes before that,
[2535.00 - 2538.00] P:1539.69 E:0.096182 |  but it was just starting to create bottlenecks around.
[2538.00 - 2543.00] P:1496.40 E:0.087988 |  Basically, it's the same issue. It's akin to the one at Wembley before the Euro 2020 final,
[2543.00 - 2546.00] P:1510.14 E:0.079991 |  and it's the outer perimeter that's the problem.
[2546.00 - 2551.00] P:1490.88 E:0.086593 |  And this is a stadium that's got one of the major roads in Paris,
[2551.00 - 2555.00] P:1522.77 E:0.095979 |  I think it's literally A1, it goes straight out of Paris North running one side.
[2555.00 - 2559.00] P:1438.72 E:0.099818 |  It's got another dual carriage road running along the south side of the stadium,
[2559.00 - 2560.00] P:1512.15 E:0.102446 |  and then there's the river at the back.
[2560.00 - 2563.00] P:1592.73 E:0.096373 |  And the issue with all of that is that there are underpasses around the stadium,
[2563.00 - 2567.00] P:1422.93 E:0.084493 |  which is where they've decided to put these ticket barriers,
[2567.00 - 2572.00] P:1463.95 E:0.094282 |  essentially the outer ticket area to check whether people have got tickets.
[2572.00 - 2576.00] P:1362.09 E:0.094333 |  And at that point, they're checking tickets, they're taking any alcohol off people,
[2576.00 - 2577.00] P:1522.26 E:0.093770 |  and they're searching bags.
[2577.00 - 2581.00] P:1453.85 E:0.087242 |  And the problem there is that takes time, it's simply...
[2581.00 - 2583.00] P:1546.19 E:0.097138 |  But secondly, there are a lot of people outside who haven't got tickets.
[2583.00 - 2586.00] P:1711.56 E:0.097182 |  It's too close to the stadium. That was the problem at Wembley wasn't it?
[2586.00 - 2589.00] P:1661.48 E:0.085994 |  The outer perimeters were too close to the actual entrance to the ground.
[2589.00 - 2593.00] P:1535.40 E:0.092360 |  Yeah, and there's no... I mean, in an ideal world, you want an outer perimeter
[2593.00 - 2596.00] P:1608.84 E:0.094140 |  outside the outer perimeter, you'd want something to stop.
[2596.00 - 2599.00] P:1364.05 E:0.083444 |  Tens of thousands of people potentially who haven't got tickets
[2599.00 - 2603.00] P:1494.43 E:0.091460 |  getting to that outer perimeter and just chanting their arm, which is what they're doing.
[2603.00 - 2606.00] P:1441.55 E:0.102365 |  That was one of the issues at Wembley for the final last summer, wasn't it?
[2606.00 - 2607.00] P:1551.78 E:0.090078 |  Yeah.
[2607.00 - 2612.00] P:1379.38 E:0.086128 |  The inquiry flagged up the fact that there was not that layer of security
[2612.00 - 2618.00] P:1592.90 E:0.091468 |  that you very often see at events like this, but which we all know this was not the case here today.
[2618.00 - 2621.00] P:1621.62 E:0.097489 |  Yeah, and I saw... I mean, one of the entrances that I came in from,
[2621.00 - 2625.00] P:1569.62 E:0.093160 |  I walked a minute towards the stadium once I got inside,
[2625.00 - 2627.00] P:1702.87 E:0.079868 |  I saw Riot Police going the other way.
[2627.00 - 2631.00] P:1407.83 E:0.090594 |  It is tents out there, and of course, the closer you get to kick off,
[2631.00 - 2633.00] P:1329.18 E:0.086774 |  the more people with tickets are thinking,
[2633.00 - 2637.00] P:1336.80 E:0.096256 |  well, I want to make kick off, I want to get in, and they're getting a little bit nervous.
[2637.00 - 2639.00] P:1091.65 E:0.102883 |  And the more that people who haven't got tickets are thinking,
[2639.00 - 2642.00] P:1265.01 E:0.097792 |  well, let's chance their arm here, they'll be seeing pictures inside.
[2642.00 - 2644.00] P:1278.37 E:0.092270 |  As we're looking in the stadium at the moment,
[2644.00 - 2647.00] P:1350.99 E:0.099262 |  the Liverpool end is noticeably more empty than the Real Madrid end.
[2647.00 - 2650.00] P:1435.13 E:0.082091 |  I'm not saying this isn't affecting the Madrid fans,
[2650.00 - 2656.00] P:1411.10 E:0.079274 |  but the vast majority, overwhelming majority of fans that I saw who were struggling to get in were wearing red.
[2656.00 - 2660.00] P:1648.91 E:0.084702 |  James, thank you very much for joining us. Really, really appreciate that.
[2660.00 - 2665.00] P:1351.68 E:0.090210 |  Something that we need to mention that's going on in relation to the match here is,
[2665.00 - 2669.00] P:1320.09 E:0.088555 |  as we all know, Thiago has been a doubt for this game.
[2669.00 - 2672.00] P:1291.39 E:0.091046 |  Now, he came out with the rest of the squad to warm up,
[2672.00 - 2676.00] P:1431.96 E:0.089500 |  but he then peeled away and went over to the tunnel area,
[2676.00 - 2681.00] P:1350.79 E:0.085557 |  but then came back into the middle of the pitch where the Liverpool warm-up was taking place,
[2681.00 - 2684.00] P:1333.99 E:0.096724 |  and he was involved in a long conversation with Jurgen Klopp,
[2684.00 - 2688.00] P:1384.19 E:0.085744 |  and with a couple of the coaches out there,
[2688.00 - 2694.00] P:1321.23 E:0.085585 |  Naby Keita went across to join in with the team that's starting in their warm-up,
[2694.00 - 2697.00] P:1282.19 E:0.093577 |  and just looking at him now, that conversation is still going on,
[2697.00 - 2703.00] P:1367.98 E:0.080492 |  and he came across just now to Jurgen Klopp, who actually put his arm around him.
[2703.00 - 2707.00] P:1102.26 E:0.086651 |  Now, he's still out there, and this looks touch and go.
[2707.00 - 2709.00] P:1670.74 E:0.105682 |  He's not moving that well either, you know,
[2709.00 - 2714.00] P:1390.89 E:0.086948 |  you know when you can see players trying to push themselves to go at full tilt,
[2714.00 - 2720.00] P:1502.81 E:0.099705 |  and he's twisting and turning, and he is moving rather awkwardly on the turn,
[2720.00 - 2723.00] P:1349.76 E:0.101007 |  and Jurgen has just given him a big hook,
[2723.00 - 2727.00] P:1557.14 E:0.105178 |  not sure obviously what he's said to him, but he did give him a big hook,
[2727.00 - 2731.00] P:1476.48 E:0.108175 |  and then he's off again and spraying a couple of balls around,
[2731.00 - 2733.00] P:1699.57 E:0.094395 |  so yeah, that seems a strange one.
[2733.00 - 2735.00] P:1504.99 E:0.107656 |  He's obviously giving him time, isn't he,
[2735.00 - 2738.00] P:1685.27 E:0.099663 |  because otherwise he wouldn't still be warming up,
[2738.00 - 2741.00] P:1579.27 E:0.097602 |  but it's a big decision for Jurgen Klopp to make,
[2741.00 - 2744.00] P:1588.77 E:0.093106 |  because what he can't do is he can't afford to take, or this Liverpool team,
[2744.00 - 2746.00] P:1440.68 E:0.075885 |  can't afford to carry passengers.
[2746.00 - 2749.00] P:1553.92 E:0.098392 |  Right, well, we will keep you up to date on that right now, Thiago,
[2749.00 - 2752.00] P:1755.98 E:0.095390 |  he's just on the far side, just pulling up his sleeves,
[2752.00 - 2755.00] P:1768.41 E:0.092186 |  I've just seen him look up to the sky and shake his head a little bit,
[2755.00 - 2758.00] P:1570.82 E:0.096563 |  we'll have to wait and see whether or not he is going to be fit to play.
[2758.00 - 2762.00] P:1627.10 E:0.089912 |  We're going to talk more now about what is happening on the pitch in front of us,
[2762.00 - 2766.00] P:1778.00 E:0.094126 |  just watch Luka Modric take a little practice shot from the edge of the area,
[2766.00 - 2770.00] P:1346.65 E:0.083588 |  which Thibault Courtois, palmed around the post.
[2770.00 - 2775.00] P:1599.33 E:0.086314 |  Modric, the heart of this team, and Karim Bendzema, of course, is the Gauls,
[2775.00 - 2780.00] P:1666.79 E:0.083460 |  15 of them in 11 matches in the Champions League for Real Madrid this season.
[2780.00 - 2784.00] P:1565.80 E:0.087102 |  We've been speaking to Rafa Benitez, the former Liverpool boss, of course,
[2784.00 - 2788.00] P:1830.41 E:0.079477 |  and former Real Madrid manager, he coached both of them in his time at the Bernabéu.
[2788.00 - 2794.00] P:1532.15 E:0.073467 |  He's been telling us what makes them both special, starting with the classy Croatian.
[2794.00 - 2797.00] P:1821.50 E:0.097492 |  The fact that he's playing, still is playing at the level that he's playing,
[2797.00 - 2800.00] P:1869.28 E:0.065751 |  means how good he is and how professional he is.
[2800.00 - 2804.00] P:1756.88 E:0.077586 |  So to be fair, the majority of the players when I was there, they were quite professional,
[2804.00 - 2810.00] P:1730.97 E:0.082089 |  because they know that they cannot sleep, I don't know how the expression is in English,
[2810.00 - 2814.00] P:1931.71 E:0.067928 |  but they sleep in their laurels or something like that.
[2814.00 - 2819.00] P:1685.45 E:0.086891 |  Sleep in their laurels, people that fall asleep while they are at the top.
[2819.00 - 2824.00] P:1792.52 E:0.079991 |  The difference is that if you don't do well, they will bring someone else,
[2824.00 - 2826.00] P:1790.19 E:0.056499 |  that will do it better than you.
[2826.00 - 2829.00] P:1845.52 E:0.083634 |  So everybody wants to do well, everybody wants to train well,
[2829.00 - 2832.00] P:1765.53 E:0.082332 |  the majority are quite professional and they want to do well.
[2832.00 - 2835.00] P:1908.34 E:0.076083 |  So Modric is this kind of player, he's trying to improve.
[2835.00 - 2841.00] P:1872.12 E:0.074426 |  He has one thing that is not easy to find now in modern football,
[2841.00 - 2843.00] P:1964.42 E:0.062363 |  is the understanding of the game.
[2843.00 - 2846.00] P:1723.54 E:0.090450 |  So he can drop off a little bit to help the defenders to play from the back,
[2846.00 - 2850.00] P:1800.27 E:0.090551 |  or he can go at the exit of the box to give an assist or to finish.
[2850.00 - 2855.00] P:1931.97 E:0.072172 |  So he's a player that he knows or he understands what is going on during the game
[2855.00 - 2857.00] P:1631.35 E:0.070931 |  and he's trying to help the teammates around.
[2857.00 - 2864.00] P:1972.34 E:0.073346 |  Do you see any differences when you look at the Luca Modric of 2022 to the Modric you coached?
[2864.00 - 2867.00] P:1826.09 E:0.091876 |  I will ask you the same question.
[2867.00 - 2870.00] P:1685.20 E:0.080953 |  Are you a better journalist now or 10 years ago?
[2870.00 - 2871.00] P:1741.65 E:0.072148 |  Hopefully now, Rafa.
[2871.00 - 2873.00] P:1612.75 E:0.065265 |  That is the point.
[2873.00 - 2879.00] P:1834.20 E:0.082345 |  So normally people talk about the social media coaches like I call them now,
[2879.00 - 2882.00] P:1788.14 E:0.087580 |  they're the new generation of, but they don't have experience.
[2882.00 - 2887.00] P:1812.44 E:0.077705 |  So you will have maybe one that will be great, but maybe five will not be so good
[2887.00 - 2891.00] P:1874.24 E:0.070162 |  because they will need to learn, they will need time to make mistakes
[2891.00 - 2897.00] P:1784.36 E:0.072940 |  and to realize that they have made a mistake and then find the solution for the next time.
[2897.00 - 2901.00] P:1806.01 E:0.073236 |  Modric is the same, Modric is much better, he's like Benzema,
[2901.00 - 2904.00] P:1845.59 E:0.067695 |  when we were there he was scoring goals, he was doing well,
[2904.00 - 2909.00] P:1751.89 E:0.085274 |  but now he's even better and Modric is even better in terms of what understanding of the game.
[2909.00 - 2915.00] P:1922.30 E:0.080642 |  So I will go again experience, allow you to go to one place in a sprint or maybe jog in
[2915.00 - 2917.00] P:1630.29 E:0.072249 |  because you know that you have plenty of time.
[2917.00 - 2922.00] P:1929.98 E:0.073502 |  So this positional understanding of the game makes you to run less,
[2922.00 - 2925.00] P:1818.18 E:0.069997 |  but to be at the right time in the right place.
[2925.00 - 2928.00] P:1733.92 E:0.079438 |  So that is Benzema now, that is Luca Modric.
[2928.00 - 2931.00] P:1756.67 E:0.068165 |  Let's talk a bit more about about carrying Benzema then.
[2931.00 - 2938.00] P:1847.38 E:0.070877 |  I mean, I imagine it must be a special thing as a coach to have a player who at that time
[2938.00 - 2946.00] P:1997.33 E:0.072306 |  seemed willing to not be the main attraction, to be a little bit in the shadow of another.
[2946.00 - 2954.00] P:1812.24 E:0.075055 |  Yeah, I remember talking with the people, the coaches and everybody was telling me that Benzema was really good
[2954.00 - 2958.00] P:1829.68 E:0.077547 |  and then you go there, you see him training, the movements were very clever,
[2958.00 - 2963.00] P:1833.48 E:0.070806 |  dropping off as a false number nine and now you can see so many of them.
[2963.00 - 2966.00] P:1494.35 E:0.092380 |  He could link with the other player, he could get into the home.
[2966.00 - 2969.00] P:1960.64 E:0.072922 |  He was missing a little bit the accuracy at this time.
[2969.00 - 2973.00] P:1818.42 E:0.089662 |  He is much better now in terms of accuracy and finishing.
[2973.00 - 2980.00] P:1747.95 E:0.072510 |  So at this time we had Ronaldo, we had Gary Bale, so then he was around and he was not the main focus,
[2980.00 - 2987.00] P:1855.71 E:0.075388 |  but everybody inside, everybody in the dressing room, the staff, we knew that he was a key player
[2987.00 - 2993.00] P:1694.21 E:0.081308 |  and I was trying to bring another striker and I said, no, no, you have Benzema, you have Benzema.
[2993.00 - 2996.00] P:1471.17 E:0.089375 |  Yeah, but Benzema could get injured and then we have a young player, Mayoral,
[2996.00 - 3000.00] P:1726.24 E:0.083680 |  that at this time was a 19-year-old coming from the academy
[3000.00 - 3006.00] P:1840.60 E:0.068014 |  and these are the strikers that they had and Benzema after he had some issues and we lost him
[3006.00 - 3008.00] P:1944.94 E:0.090264 |  and we were missing his goals and his movements.
[3008.00 - 3013.00] P:1783.04 E:0.072280 |  It's not just the goal that he was scoring at this time, it's just the movements that allow Ronaldo
[3013.00 - 3018.00] P:1881.58 E:0.083442 |  because Ronaldo at this time was playing on the left side and he was going inside behind Benzema
[3018.00 - 3023.00] P:1786.12 E:0.077360 |  so he could leave with Benzema and the right full back couldn't follow him so much
[3023.00 - 3031.00] P:1911.34 E:0.072292 |  and then it was because Marcelo was going forward, so that was giving Ronaldo more time and space to score more goals
[3031.00 - 3034.00] P:1649.56 E:0.057784 |  and you can say that credit to Benzema.
[3035.00 - 3041.00] P:1669.49 E:0.084296 |  20 minutes to go here in the Stade de France until kickoff in the Champions League final.
[3041.00 - 3046.00] P:1761.76 E:0.087929 |  That is the roar from the Real Madrid fans for their players as they run off the pitch to finish their warm-up.
[3046.00 - 3050.00] P:1650.76 E:0.089761 |  The Liverpool players disappeared just a couple of minutes ago.
[3050.00 - 3055.00] P:1685.06 E:0.083675 |  We've got Alan Shearer, Chris Sutton, correspondent John Murray, all with us.
[3055.00 - 3060.00] P:1864.54 E:0.086980 |  John, one thing I noticed there as they ran off the pitch is Jürgen Klopp went over to Navigator
[3060.00 - 3064.00] P:1614.21 E:0.083130 |  and he put his arm around him and he had a chat and I think you probably know what's next.
[3064.00 - 3069.00] P:1416.69 E:0.089430 |  Yeah, they had one final little warm-up drill, didn't they, on this side of the field.
[3069.00 - 3076.00] P:1483.12 E:0.090083 |  Jürgen Klopp was right there watching Thiago who was a part of that but he gave him a little arm round the shoulder
[3076.00 - 3082.00] P:1473.21 E:0.080753 |  as he ran past Jürgen Klopp and then immediately went across to Keita, big arm around him,
[3082.00 - 3085.00] P:1333.35 E:0.079440 |  a lot of talking going on as they walked down the tunnel.
[3085.00 - 3091.00] P:1507.41 E:0.084166 |  So we've not got confirmation yet but that looked very much to me as I'm sure it did to you too as well.
[3091.00 - 3095.00] P:1522.95 E:0.073666 |  Chris, Alan, it's going to be Keita, not Thiago's starter.
[3095.00 - 3104.00] P:1593.53 E:0.083899 |  Yeah, that hug of the arm round the shoulder suggested to me that unfortunately, if it's argued, it doesn't look good news.
[3104.00 - 3109.00] P:1635.36 E:0.097922 |  You can't risk, Kenny, and that's the biggest thing, the importance of this game.
[3109.00 - 3114.00] P:1540.14 E:0.092995 |  You can't let Thiago try and play 20 minutes and then find out it's not fit and go with goal behind.
[3114.00 - 3116.00] P:1310.97 E:0.089013 |  So it's the right decision if that's the case.
[3116.00 - 3120.00] P:1609.74 E:0.099760 |  Well, the flags from the Liverpool fans are out and waving again.
[3120.00 - 3123.00] P:1915.28 E:0.093076 |  Their end of the stadium might not be completely full just yet
[3123.00 - 3128.00] P:1625.21 E:0.083359 |  but when this piece of music comes on, they make noise.
[3128.00 - 3130.00] P:1712.12 E:0.095146 |  For Thiago, you have to feel sorry for him.
[3130.00 - 3137.00] P:1564.61 E:0.098041 |  If Liverpool win the Champions League tonight, we will hear this roar by all of the fans away to our right-hand side.
[3137.00 - 3142.00] P:1752.40 E:0.096964 |  We felt sorry for Mo Salah in 2018 when he was injured with five minutes gone in the game.
[3142.00 - 3148.00] P:1564.95 E:0.088149 |  You have to feel for Thiago injured with 20 minutes to go before the game.
[3148.00 - 3152.00] P:1683.87 E:0.088974 |  We will tell you once we get official confirmation.
[3152.00 - 3154.00] P:1689.98 E:0.101337 |  He was going to be going up against.
[3154.00 - 3159.00] P:1507.12 E:0.096251 |  Luca Modric, we just heard from Rafa Benitez telling us all about him.
[3159.00 - 3164.00] P:1806.92 E:0.104206 |  Delighted to say now that Juliana Ron has joined us live on Five Lives Sport.
[3164.00 - 3165.00] P:1774.32 E:0.098471 |  Hi, Jules.
[3165.00 - 3166.00] P:1775.16 E:0.074265 |  Hello, guys.
[3166.00 - 3169.00] P:1735.20 E:0.097576 |  We don't know exactly what's going to happen with Thiago
[3169.00 - 3172.00] P:1649.45 E:0.096354 |  but what we do know is your fellow countryman, Karim Benzema.
[3172.00 - 3175.00] P:1612.81 E:0.097684 |  Chris was saying Liverpool must be clinical tonight.
[3175.00 - 3179.00] P:1580.91 E:0.089498 |  We know Karim Benzema, if he gets a chance, we'll almost certainly take it.
[3179.00 - 3184.00] P:1279.03 E:0.095426 |  Right, we're going to set those numbers again because there are incredible 15 goals in this competition so far
[3184.00 - 3186.00] P:1402.30 E:0.088864 |  of unexpected goals of eight.
[3186.00 - 3189.00] P:1420.28 E:0.098451 |  So there are seven goals, whether you believe on data or not, and stats or not.
[3189.00 - 3193.00] P:1595.18 E:0.099085 |  He still has scored some goals, especially the two Aston Fabrizio, two Headers,
[3193.00 - 3195.00] P:1655.65 E:0.093030 |  that you would not have expected anyone to score.
[3195.00 - 3200.00] P:1503.96 E:0.094957 |  He's in the form of his life at the age of 34.
[3200.00 - 3203.00] P:1718.40 E:0.112001 |  And we've said, usually you only wear down at that age, he's on the way up.
[3203.00 - 3209.00] P:1332.57 E:0.095237 |  And for him to be able to play like this, to lead his team like this, to be this leader
[3209.00 - 3212.00] P:1576.57 E:0.093707 |  and to deliver on the pitch is pretty remarkable.
[3212.00 - 3217.00] P:1581.54 E:0.092168 |  There's a Ballon d'Or at stake, of course, this season, and he's in a great position to win it.
[3217.00 - 3220.00] P:1582.18 E:0.105090 |  I'm not sure how much of a bearing tonight we'll have on the Ballon d'Or,
[3220.00 - 3226.00] P:1474.44 E:0.091246 |  but for Karim Benzema, this is special, the whole Benzema family is literally across the pitch from us here.
[3226.00 - 3229.00] P:1588.04 E:0.094175 |  They're not going to have another occasion like this.
[3229.00 - 3235.00] P:1449.07 E:0.100056 |  He's got maybe three years left on his career, there's not going to be another final in France for him in the Champions League.
[3235.00 - 3240.00] P:1407.71 E:0.097791 |  So this is the night where Karim Benzema has, for the last time this season, has to deliver.
[3240.00 - 3245.00] P:1386.45 E:0.096363 |  Has him coming out of Ronaldo's shadow been the making of him then in the last couple of seasons?
[3245.00 - 3247.00] P:1490.24 E:0.101218 |  I think so. The talent has always been there.
[3247.00 - 3254.00] P:1544.93 E:0.104771 |  When he started in Ligue 16, you could see so easily how amazing he was and how incredible he was going to be.
[3254.00 - 3258.00] P:1815.64 E:0.090946 |  But I think he realized that for the good of himself and of Ran Madruini,
[3258.00 - 3262.00] P:1766.42 E:0.085949 |  he had to be at the service almost of Cristiano and he was very happy with that.
[3262.00 - 3269.00] P:1619.70 E:0.088412 |  When Cristiano left and went to Juventus, he felt like he had to take that leadership roll over and be the key guy.
[3269.00 - 3273.00] P:1480.78 E:0.087824 |  But I still didn't expect him to do it that way, to be so good at it.
[3273.00 - 3276.00] P:1399.55 E:0.091885 |  And yeah, he's been incredible the last three years.
[3276.00 - 3281.00] P:1611.50 E:0.094617 |  Chris, Alan, I've been looking forward to having this conversation all weekend with you two.
[3281.00 - 3284.00] P:1554.77 E:0.092600 |  Two great number nines on another great number nine.
[3284.00 - 3290.00] P:1651.80 E:0.088364 |  When you look at Benzema, Alan, you know, your specialist eye that you have from having done that job at the top of the game,
[3290.00 - 3292.00] P:1671.06 E:0.087261 |  what do you really admire about him?
[3292.00 - 3299.00] P:1559.35 E:0.089136 |  He can do everything. What is not really recognized from a lot of people is that the amount of time he comes deep
[3299.00 - 3302.00] P:1668.73 E:0.087104 |  to allow other people to run in behind.
[3302.00 - 3306.00] P:1780.47 E:0.099830 |  We saw Harry Kane do it a lot more in his career.
[3306.00 - 3310.00] P:1695.02 E:0.101374 |  Benzema loves doing that. He loves linking up the play.
[3310.00 - 3317.00] P:1634.79 E:0.096690 |  He also likes going the other way, but that hasn't taken anything away from his goal scoring numbers
[3317.00 - 3322.00] P:1776.21 E:0.093495 |  because when that ball goes into the box, you know, eight or nine times out of ten,
[3322.00 - 3326.00] P:1651.07 E:0.093608 |  that they're looking for him or he's going to be the one that's going to be on the end of it.
[3326.00 - 3331.00] P:1667.37 E:0.090562 |  I love everything about this game. He's a fantastic centre forward,
[3331.00 - 3336.00] P:1648.79 E:0.075278 |  which, or who pauses a tremendous threat to Liverpool tonight.
[3336.00 - 3340.00] P:1808.11 E:0.107965 |  He's a team player, isn't he? And Jules reading up on him.
[3340.00 - 3343.00] P:1707.80 E:0.089897 |  At Lyon, he played different positions across the front line.
[3343.00 - 3347.00] P:1722.68 E:0.101284 |  So, you know, he played as a number ten. He's learnt his trade.
[3347.00 - 3353.00] P:1753.84 E:0.092380 |  We talked last night about he got to kick up the backside from Jose Mourinho, who called him out.
[3353.00 - 3356.00] P:1791.63 E:0.095104 |  He then knuckled down, got himself superbly conditioned.
[3356.00 - 3363.00] P:1714.59 E:0.093723 |  And I think that's the key now, why he is playing or continuing to succeed at the very, very highest level at 34.
[3363.00 - 3367.00] P:1518.65 E:0.088811 |  Yeah, you're right. That invisible work that we were talking yesterday,
[3367.00 - 3373.00] P:1573.71 E:0.088697 |  everything that he does outside of either training or the football pitch when in these games,
[3373.00 - 3379.00] P:1574.18 E:0.074723 |  why he eats the teamwork that he does, the, you know, all the recovery stuff.
[3379.00 - 3384.00] P:1572.70 E:0.097028 |  Steve, you need to mention that there is a message now being relayed into the stadium
[3384.00 - 3389.00] P:1775.12 E:0.095335 |  and it's actually appeared on the big screens high at both sides of the ground.
[3389.00 - 3395.00] P:1707.21 E:0.083614 |  The match has been delayed. It says due to the late arrival of fans at the stadium,
[3395.00 - 3399.00] P:1569.50 E:0.085652 |  the match has been delayed and it will kick off.
[3399.00 - 3402.00] P:1697.15 E:0.079334 |  That's the plan is in, did it say 15 minutes later?
[3402.00 - 3408.00] P:1633.00 E:0.085083 |  Yes. So, it will be in what, an 8-15 kickoff UK time, 9-15 here in France.
[3408.00 - 3412.00] P:1724.04 E:0.081821 |  It also said that more information will follow as well, Jules.
[3412.00 - 3417.00] P:1763.99 E:0.088131 |  I've just been sent something on social media, actually, which is a photograph of Liverpool fans
[3417.00 - 3421.00] P:1701.32 E:0.082860 |  outside the stadium and the caption from one of the people who's written this.
[3421.00 - 3426.00] P:1600.64 E:0.085219 |  And obviously, you know, can't verify this, you just want Liverpool fans that we've read here saying outside the stadium.
[3426.00 - 3429.00] P:1538.06 E:0.086101 |  Our gate has closed, but they won't let us in another one.
[3429.00 - 3432.00] P:1590.93 E:0.085330 |  So, we need to find out more about that if we can.
[3432.00 - 3436.00] P:1813.97 E:0.089760 |  But look, clearly Jules, I don't know if you saw anything on your way in.
[3436.00 - 3438.00] P:1602.16 E:0.077634 |  It's been really, really poor.
[3438.00 - 3442.00] P:1606.68 E:0.087597 |  Yes, it's been quite difficult. I think the police, there was heavy police presence,
[3442.00 - 3446.00] P:1802.55 E:0.068979 |  which you would expect, of course, it's a shoot-stage.
[3446.00 - 3448.00] P:1618.55 E:0.094948 |  It's quite difficult actually to arrive here.
[3448.00 - 3452.00] P:1665.03 E:0.077742 |  There's a strike for the train that comes here to the Stade de France.
[3452.00 - 3455.00] P:1572.52 E:0.074193 |  And also, there's a lot of people without tickets.
[3455.00 - 3459.00] P:1505.31 E:0.089784 |  Whether they're Liverpool fans, Real Madrid fans or Neutral fans as well,
[3459.00 - 3462.00] P:1614.76 E:0.079143 |  there's a lot of people here without tickets.
[3462.00 - 3465.00] P:1664.18 E:0.085600 |  And there was reports of fans trying to get in without the tickets.
[3465.00 - 3470.00] P:1615.67 E:0.081852 |  There was reports that police were really, really tough on their body searching,
[3470.00 - 3475.00] P:1622.96 E:0.081248 |  and maybe too much actually, that was slowing down the process of letting the people with tickets
[3475.00 - 3480.00] P:1690.03 E:0.079192 |  through as well. So, it's not what we like to see.
[3480.00 - 3483.00] P:1810.45 E:0.084251 |  A Champions League final should not start 15 minutes late.
[3483.00 - 3485.00] P:1485.14 E:0.089680 |  It shouldn't have that kind of issues.
[3485.00 - 3490.00] P:1380.92 E:0.092745 |  Absolutely, Jules. And Dom King from the mail.
[3490.00 - 3494.00] P:1526.00 E:0.095920 |  I think, Dom, you're just joining us. You've just been outside.
[3494.00 - 3498.00] P:1371.91 E:0.086113 |  Yeah, I've been watching the three-tale stars from here.
[3498.00 - 3502.00] P:1335.99 E:0.097884 |  T, S, U and T, which are in the corner behind where we are.
[3502.00 - 3506.00] P:1384.87 E:0.085643 |  It's crazy. There's no student. There's no help.
[3506.00 - 3508.00] P:1388.12 E:0.081277 |  There's no help from anybody outside.
[3508.00 - 3511.00] P:1235.27 E:0.100818 |  There's fans outside that just aren't going to be in before.
[3511.00 - 3513.00] P:1414.31 E:0.092460 |  Even this before the kick-off is, I believe it's been delayed.
[3513.00 - 3516.00] P:1374.34 E:0.099153 |  A UEFA official said to me outside that they were thinking about,
[3516.00 - 3519.00] P:1243.48 E:0.086113 |  yeah, it's appalling. It should not be happening.
[3519.00 - 3522.00] P:1270.62 E:0.089847 |  We came in from the Metro.
[3522.00 - 3527.00] P:1289.45 E:0.087362 |  It was just not adequate in terms of looking after people in this day and age.
[3527.00 - 3530.00] P:1398.90 E:0.087332 |  It's another UEFA event that's been a failure now.
[3530.00 - 3535.00] P:1590.87 E:0.086382 |  Dom, as John was just saying, we know that we've got to delay to kick-off here.
[3535.00 - 3540.00] P:1660.51 E:0.084851 |  But from what you've seen outside, I just mentioned the photograph where you were saying,
[3540.00 - 3543.00] P:1731.47 E:0.088398 |  that is reliable. It's from John Gibbons from the Anfield Rap.
[3543.00 - 3546.00] P:1714.28 E:0.093341 |  So, yes, there might be a lot of fans without tickets who've been trying to get in,
[3546.00 - 3548.00] P:1738.59 E:0.094923 |  but there's loads of fans with tickets as well who can't get in.
[3548.00 - 3554.00] P:1505.51 E:0.088115 |  Steve, that's the point. I was just spoken to a couple of fans who've been outside for an hour.
[3554.00 - 3557.00] P:1342.19 E:0.079767 |  An hour and a half, who've got here in plenty of time
[3557.00 - 3561.00] P:1516.39 E:0.080999 |  and haven't been given the getting people outside who are trying to be pickpocketed,
[3561.00 - 3563.00] P:1477.78 E:0.077387 |  trying to have the tickets stolen off them.
[3563.00 - 3566.00] P:1507.87 E:0.086549 |  There's just nothing outside in terms of any help for anybody.
[3566.00 - 3570.00] P:1512.61 E:0.086261 |  But you're right, aren't you? Another UEFA fan where there are difficulties,
[3570.00 - 3575.00] P:1575.38 E:0.091836 |  whether it's the final of the Euros last summer or whether it was Athens or whether it's Istanbul.
[3575.00 - 3577.00] P:1537.68 E:0.071299 |  Yeah, now it's Paris.
[3577.00 - 3581.00] P:1440.44 E:0.079988 |  Yeah, it's a really horrible state of affairs.
[3581.00 - 3586.00] P:1466.06 E:0.078067 |  How many people have been looking forward to this once in a lifetime opportunity may be saved up?
[3586.00 - 3591.00] P:1392.53 E:0.084653 |  Come to have a wonderful time and outside, they're going through a really, really bad experience.
[3591.00 - 3593.00] P:1426.96 E:0.080454 |  Your heart goes out for them.
[3593.00 - 3596.00] P:1688.68 E:0.084241 |  There are going to be some really difficult questions for you ever to answer here,
[3596.00 - 3600.00] P:1632.79 E:0.083003 |  because it's one thing to have something like this happen at the final of Euro 2020.
[3600.00 - 3604.00] P:1830.72 E:0.088089 |  It's another one, as a lot of people may well say, not to learn from that.
[3604.00 - 3608.00] P:1352.54 E:0.082018 |  It's awful. I was at Wembley on that day last year,
[3608.00 - 3612.00] P:1503.26 E:0.078754 |  and it was one of the worst experiences I've seen in football.
[3613.00 - 3616.00] P:1362.29 E:0.072007 |  What I'm seeing on the other side of the fence tonight,
[3616.00 - 3619.00] P:1603.28 E:0.070474 |  there's people panicking wanting to get in,
[3619.00 - 3624.00] P:1433.88 E:0.071397 |  there's people just living with the way that they've been treated.
[3624.00 - 3627.00] P:1620.25 E:0.090079 |  I agree with all the criticism of UEFA,
[3627.00 - 3630.00] P:1705.90 E:0.087581 |  but I've got to say getting in was a real struggle for me,
[3630.00 - 3633.00] P:1652.99 E:0.087947 |  because there were a lot of fans who didn't have tickets,
[3633.00 - 3637.00] P:1688.46 E:0.084053 |  who were the ones causing the problem, and it wasn't just a dozen.
[3637.00 - 3638.00] P:1437.98 E:0.040667 |  No, no.
[3638.00 - 3640.00] P:1672.58 E:0.093796 |  It was a lot more than that.
[3640.00 - 3644.00] P:1702.41 E:0.080000 |  There's an element of self-responsibility for all the Liverpool fans who brought tickets,
[3644.00 - 3647.00] P:1759.59 E:0.078976 |  they're ruining it for the Liverpool fans who actually brought tickets.
[3647.00 - 3650.00] P:1655.27 E:0.082617 |  Chris, can I just haven't seen stuff outside?
[3650.00 - 3652.00] P:1707.09 E:0.066951 |  There's local kids as well.
[3652.00 - 3657.00] P:1611.97 E:0.080615 |  There's a mix of people that are trying to get in from what I've seen outside.
[3657.00 - 3660.00] P:1591.12 E:0.086521 |  Slightly different messages now being put up on the screens.
[3660.00 - 3664.00] P:1771.77 E:0.078930 |  It says, due to a security issue, the match has been delayed,
[3664.00 - 3668.00] P:1739.95 E:0.078091 |  and further information will follow in 15 minutes maximum.
[3668.00 - 3671.00] P:1476.38 E:0.081896 |  So I think initially it said the kick-off would be delayed for 15 minutes,
[3671.00 - 3675.00] P:1590.79 E:0.081864 |  now it's saying that there will be more information in 15 minutes.
[3675.00 - 3681.00] P:1653.92 E:0.090891 |  I think first and foremost, we've got to hope that everyone is OK outside the stadium and getting in.
[3681.00 - 3686.00] P:1915.42 E:0.084456 |  But from a player's perspective, the players' preparation is meticulous to the minute.
[3686.00 - 3689.00] P:1890.42 E:0.076724 |  They've been out, they've warmed up.
[3689.00 - 3695.00] P:1712.26 E:0.073223 |  Their day has been designed for every single minute to kick-off at 9 o'clock.
[3695.00 - 3700.00] P:1746.48 E:0.097578 |  Now they're back in the dressing room, they don't know how long they've got to sit around and hang around
[3700.00 - 3703.00] P:1747.90 E:0.089791 |  and wait for and stretch for and do everything else.
[3703.00 - 3709.00] P:1769.77 E:0.080763 |  These are elite athletes. These guys push themselves to the limit, so it's no good for the players either.
[3709.00 - 3715.00] P:1578.15 E:0.076451 |  Mentally as well, Alan, you've got yourself ready to go, as you said.
[3715.00 - 3719.00] P:1592.81 E:0.077821 |  You're walking around the dressing room now, how do you keep your mind?
[3719.00 - 3722.00] P:1735.96 E:0.098013 |  They've been given specific timings that they can warm up to.
[3722.00 - 3727.00] P:1767.64 E:0.094027 |  They've got to be out on the pitch at, I don't know, quarter past eight or something like that, quarter past seven.
[3727.00 - 3734.00] P:1726.23 E:0.092708 |  English time. They've got to be off the pitch at a specific time to get back in to allow the start to happen.
[3734.00 - 3739.00] P:1766.72 E:0.096324 |  So as I said, they're just sitting in the dressing room now and not knowing when they're going to actually get out,
[3739.00 - 3742.00] P:1744.31 E:0.103171 |  whether they might have to come out and do another warm-up as well.
[3742.00 - 3749.00] P:1672.82 E:0.089260 |  But obviously the chief concern has to be the safety of the people who are outside the ground.
[3749.00 - 3754.00] P:1547.89 E:0.073047 |  Yes. Whatever is happening in the various points around the stadium.
[3754.00 - 3757.00] P:1923.31 E:0.087274 |  And we could say, even just from we were trying to get into the stadium,
[3757.00 - 3765.00] P:1708.70 E:0.077020 |  that there were many, many points where it looked very, very dangerous for the people who were being pushed into each other.
[3765.00 - 3770.00] P:1723.44 E:0.080129 |  We at one point were trying to get through a crowd so that we could get up to this position here
[3770.00 - 3774.00] P:1855.89 E:0.087996 |  and the police were very clearly saying that you weren't able to go through one area
[3774.00 - 3777.00] P:1574.95 E:0.082134 |  and then you couldn't go through another area as well.
[3777.00 - 3781.00] P:1758.76 E:0.078693 |  It didn't feel good outside and it sounds dumb, it's only got worse.
[3781.00 - 3786.00] P:1666.29 E:0.072250 |  Yeah, I had a similar experience as I said, Steve coming across from the tube.
[3786.00 - 3791.00] P:1612.69 E:0.077840 |  It was flimsy sort of railings and whatever.
[3791.00 - 3796.00] P:1622.28 E:0.079297 |  There was people coming out and coming in and people getting very hot with each other
[3796.00 - 3799.00] P:1378.84 E:0.084527 |  in terms of when they were being bumped into and what not.
[3799.00 - 3802.00] P:1597.35 E:0.072801 |  It was just, as you said, a very, very unpleasant experience.
[3802.00 - 3807.00] P:1799.72 E:0.078826 |  And it does, we talked about the problems earlier with James as well that they had at Wembley Stadium.
[3807.00 - 3813.00] P:1727.44 E:0.082141 |  James was saying that part of the issue might well be that what's happened here is the same that happened at Wembley,
[3813.00 - 3817.00] P:1750.66 E:0.086490 |  that you had your perimeter just far too close to the stadium itself.
[3817.00 - 3819.00] P:1557.11 E:0.062138 |  Yeah, possibly, yeah, possibly.
[3819.00 - 3825.00] P:1596.58 E:0.083282 |  And you can sort of see the similarity again with the train station, how close it is in terms of, you know,
[3825.00 - 3827.00] P:1612.75 E:0.092154 |  and it's quite built up around there, isn't it?
[3827.00 - 3832.00] P:1537.60 E:0.075080 |  There's shops and bars and what not to the north side, I think, of the stadium.
[3832.00 - 3834.00] P:1629.42 E:0.077004 |  Thank you very much, Tom, coming on.
[3834.00 - 3835.00] P:2078.59 E:0.089274 |  Really appreciate it.
[3835.00 - 3838.00] P:1696.07 E:0.080116 |  And of course, we will continue to keep updated.
[3838.00 - 3843.00] P:1901.51 E:0.086990 |  But yeah, the last thing we saw is that an update will follow in no more than 15 minutes time.
[3843.00 - 3847.00] P:1745.38 E:0.087994 |  By the way, the role you might have heard in the background is because Zinedine Zidane is here this evening
[3847.00 - 3850.00] P:1666.06 E:0.075616 |  and the camera just panned onto his face there.
[3850.00 - 3856.00] P:1675.31 E:0.080215 |  But yeah, as we say, Alan, nothing really matters apart from people outside being safe.
[3856.00 - 3858.00] P:1738.11 E:0.084582 |  That's the thing we're all thinking about at the minute.
[3858.00 - 3861.00] P:1647.96 E:0.078777 |  And I think we saw enough to know that that can be a bit of a concern.
[3861.00 - 3863.00] P:1717.09 E:0.072547 |  Juliana Ron wants to come in.
[3863.00 - 3868.00] P:1541.49 E:0.077549 |  Yeah, no, I just, I just, I was just told that I could come back in.
[3868.00 - 3871.00] P:1580.44 E:0.090262 |  It's a shame, we said, I heard what Tom was saying.
[3871.00 - 3873.00] P:1632.78 E:0.089061 |  It's a real shame to be like this.
[3873.00 - 3877.00] P:1621.25 E:0.078948 |  I don't think it's the time to say who's out for it or not, have fought, etc., etc.
[3877.00 - 3879.00] P:1751.45 E:0.069235 |  There's still a match to look forward to.
[3879.00 - 3885.00] P:1554.15 E:0.084983 |  But it's, again, it's not a good look for Champions League, for UEFA to have a game of this calibre
[3885.00 - 3887.00] P:1695.34 E:0.079010 |  that the whole world is watching delayed.
[3887.00 - 3890.00] P:1702.97 E:0.085880 |  Clearly there's still thousands of Liverpool fans outside,
[3890.00 - 3894.00] P:1868.58 E:0.092732 |  because as you said earlier, Steve, is looking to our left,
[3894.00 - 3899.00] P:1728.64 E:0.092237 |  it seems as if the vast majority of Real Madrid fans are in, but looking around the stadium,
[3899.00 - 3904.00] P:1782.52 E:0.087299 |  I think that it looks as if the Madrid fans are just taking up about a quarter of the stadium,
[3904.00 - 3908.00] P:1768.61 E:0.083505 |  then the rest of it is red and clearly empty seats everywhere.
[3908.00 - 3912.00] P:1837.16 E:0.088895 |  So there's still thousands of Liverpool fans that are out there still to get in.
[3912.00 - 3914.00] P:1597.57 E:0.070416 |  Let's hope they're all okay.
[3914.00 - 3918.00] P:1740.49 E:0.083234 |  The other thing I've just realised is the, I don't know if actors' performance is the right word,
[3918.00 - 3924.00] P:1749.64 E:0.073267 |  for the opening ceremony, John, opposite us stood absolutely stock still,
[3924.00 - 3928.00] P:1785.07 E:0.082618 |  ready to get on with their performance, but they're there frozen in time,
[3928.00 - 3931.00] P:1851.47 E:0.088893 |  because they obviously have no idea when this is going to start.
[3931.00 - 3932.00] P:1367.26 E:0.068425 |  Well, it would be.
[3932.00 - 3937.00] P:1652.43 E:0.086477 |  Clearly their timings will be influenced by what time kick-off is,
[3937.00 - 3943.00] P:1542.89 E:0.086030 |  so they're just going to have to be patient until they get the nod from the officials
[3943.00 - 3945.00] P:1595.20 E:0.074582 |  who are looking after that aspect of things.
[3945.00 - 3949.00] P:1658.45 E:0.088281 |  If the dancers have stretched off, whatever, they get cold,
[3949.00 - 3953.00] P:1557.59 E:0.073634 |  maybe Hamstring or two could go with the dancers, Steve.
[3953.00 - 3956.00] P:1756.85 E:0.083617 |  I don't know what tonight's dance is like, Chris,
[3956.00 - 3960.00] P:1650.91 E:0.081679 |  so I can't say how difficult it is or otherwise, but we'll find out.
[3960.00 - 3963.00] P:1716.69 E:0.083976 |  But look, Alan was just saying it, Chris, from a player's perspective,
[3963.00 - 3965.00] P:1571.65 E:0.073756 |  this is the last thing you want.
[3965.00 - 3968.00] P:1719.59 E:0.085570 |  It's not ideal. It's the same for both sets of teams,
[3968.00 - 3973.00] P:1706.29 E:0.082819 |  but as Alan said, the preparations would have been absolutely meticulous.
[3973.00 - 3979.00] P:1659.06 E:0.082800 |  Teams at the highest level pride themselves on preparation, small details.
[3979.00 - 3982.00] P:1662.38 E:0.102953 |  The players would go out and have their usual warm-up.
[3982.00 - 3984.00] P:1516.78 E:0.072911 |  Now they're in the confines of the dressing room
[3984.00 - 3989.00] P:1666.69 E:0.077790 |  and just trying to stay ready physically and mentally as well.
[3989.00 - 3995.00] P:1721.56 E:0.075228 |  It's the unknown for them still, so the sooner the game starts, the better for the players.
[3995.00 - 3998.00] P:1832.60 E:0.087935 |  Jules, we've just been saying that obviously you're here for him to get some criticism
[3998.00 - 4002.00] P:1891.75 E:0.084960 |  as far as this stadium goes, which hosts absolutely mega events all the time.
[4002.00 - 4004.00] P:1785.72 E:0.067256 |  Do you remember anything like this?
[4004.00 - 4008.00] P:1606.71 E:0.073194 |  No, never. We've had terrorist attacks here,
[4008.00 - 4012.00] P:1680.15 E:0.084626 |  where they managed out pretty well at the time a few years ago.
[4012.00 - 4015.00] P:1576.43 E:0.079693 |  I've never seen anything like this.
[4015.00 - 4017.00] P:1398.80 E:0.086631 |  They've had finals here without issues.
[4017.00 - 4020.00] P:1643.86 E:0.083724 |  They've got French Cup finals here.
[4020.00 - 4022.00] P:1737.32 E:0.082355 |  They've got rugby matches, French national team matches,
[4022.00 - 4027.00] P:1579.13 E:0.085054 |  where there's as many fans as there are now, and there's no problems at all.
[4027.00 - 4030.00] P:1479.84 E:0.088413 |  Maybe after what we saw at the Euros,
[4030.00 - 4033.00] P:1735.18 E:0.085572 |  maybe again the police checks and the checks,
[4033.00 - 4038.00] P:1619.32 E:0.086109 |  when we all came here, there were like three different steps to go in,
[4038.00 - 4040.00] P:1923.11 E:0.087937 |  where they checked that you had a ticket,
[4040.00 - 4043.00] P:1655.42 E:0.085298 |  and then your bags, and then that you had the ticket again,
[4043.00 - 4047.00] P:1729.54 E:0.091786 |  and then you went through the gates, so maybe that's why it's taking a long time.
[4047.00 - 4051.00] P:1783.65 E:0.073475 |  Or again, the problem might be that there was too much issues outside.
[4051.00 - 4054.00] P:1616.92 E:0.089870 |  A different message now, again, on the screens,
[4054.00 - 4059.00] P:1552.31 E:0.083666 |  which says due to the late arrival of fans, the match has been delayed.
[4059.00 - 4062.00] P:1817.23 E:0.083785 |  Further information will follow in 15 minutes maximum,
[4062.00 - 4067.00] P:1637.54 E:0.087030 |  and actually that's been booed and whistled by the supporters who are inside the ground,
[4067.00 - 4070.00] P:1776.62 E:0.071966 |  who clearly feel that they were here in time,
[4070.00 - 4075.00] P:1651.53 E:0.077675 |  but the process was not correct and not good enough for them to get through indeed.
[4075.00 - 4078.00] P:1732.74 E:0.080735 |  It's a very interesting decision to put that message out there,
[4078.00 - 4082.00] P:1610.06 E:0.086111 |  particularly with what we've seen outside and what other people are reporting from outside.
[4082.00 - 4085.00] P:1732.10 E:0.081463 |  I've just seen actually John Bishop, of course famous Liverpool fans,
[4085.00 - 4089.00] P:1638.54 E:0.081411 |  said at the gate in Paris, this is from a minute ago, been here for 25 minutes,
[4089.00 - 4091.00] P:1595.92 E:0.081050 |  nobody's allowed in disgraceful treatment of France,
[4091.00 - 4094.00] P:1598.48 E:0.085073 |  who are displaying an unbelievable level of patience.
[4094.00 - 4097.00] P:1739.92 E:0.086213 |  Eduardo Alvarez, who's a Spanish journalist, is outside the stadium.
[4097.00 - 4103.00] P:1658.89 E:0.082687 |  He said, I'd say there's still at least 5,000 people who haven't been able to enter.
[4103.00 - 4110.00] P:1565.80 E:0.078612 |  75% Liverpool fans that he's seeing outside, versus 25% Real Madrid fans.
[4110.00 - 4116.00] P:1583.90 E:0.075260 |  And as we can see still here, still so many empty seats, John.
[4116.00 - 4120.00] P:1407.36 E:0.075223 |  Does it look like 5,000 empty seats?
[4120.00 - 4124.00] P:1671.42 E:0.084613 |  Well, in total around the stadium, it's probably not quite, no.
[4124.00 - 4126.00] P:1537.94 E:0.065868 |  Very difficult to tell, isn't it?
[4126.00 - 4130.00] P:1296.95 E:0.072059 |  Lesson without actually being outside right now,
[4130.00 - 4135.00] P:1536.81 E:0.081603 |  we can only go on, for example, what Dom King told us,
[4135.00 - 4138.00] P:1605.19 E:0.077830 |  that it was quite fractious in places.
[4138.00 - 4143.00] P:1619.18 E:0.078505 |  So again, they've got to get this absolutely right now.
[4143.00 - 4148.00] P:1546.55 E:0.082300 |  And there's recent history here with what happened at the Euros at Wembley last summer.
[4148.00 - 4151.00] P:1562.26 E:0.090712 |  And the report that came out in the aftermath of that,
[4151.00 - 4154.00] P:1336.80 E:0.086391 |  which warned about how serious and how dangerous it could have been.
[4154.00 - 4158.00] P:1434.45 E:0.076652 |  And I remember leaving Wembley that night thinking
[4158.00 - 4161.00] P:1458.81 E:0.078117 |  that this could have been really, really serious.
[4161.00 - 4164.00] P:1516.10 E:0.082654 |  If we look at all the gates that we can see from our commentary position,
[4164.00 - 4167.00] P:1634.12 E:0.092274 |  we've got Y2, Y14, etc.
[4167.00 - 4168.00] P:1447.70 E:0.073351 |  No one is coming in.
[4168.00 - 4171.00] P:1650.23 E:0.084518 |  Usually at this time, you would have people coming to the stadium to find their seats,
[4171.00 - 4174.00] P:1499.53 E:0.087955 |  and they would be bursting out almost.
[4174.00 - 4176.00] P:1580.09 E:0.091097 |  I don't know if that's the right word, but from all those gates,
[4176.00 - 4179.00] P:1388.16 E:0.083054 |  they're all around the stadium, and you can see now, there's no movement.
[4179.00 - 4182.00] P:1684.51 E:0.088054 |  Clearly no one is getting through, no one is going to their seat,
[4182.00 - 4184.00] P:1575.03 E:0.079877 |  no one is coming to the stadium.
[4184.00 - 4187.00] P:1672.08 E:0.075683 |  So it must be a pretty big problem outside if no one is even...
[4187.00 - 4190.00] P:1751.05 E:0.073549 |  They could be just dripping one by one,
[4190.00 - 4193.00] P:1581.81 E:0.067394 |  but there's just actually no movement whatsoever.
[4193.00 - 4197.00] P:1838.36 E:0.084222 |  Just seeing this on social media as well from a couple of people,
[4197.00 - 4200.00] P:1778.95 E:0.084795 |  Gary Linnaker has just said finding it impossible to get into the ground.
[4200.00 - 4202.00] P:1753.62 E:0.078837 |  This looks very dangerous to me.
[4202.00 - 4207.00] P:1663.83 E:0.082415 |  Henry Winter as well has tweeted having spoken to a couple of fans outside,
[4207.00 - 4210.00] P:1718.26 E:0.083883 |  said he's spoken to someone who's told him it took us two and a half hours
[4210.00 - 4213.00] P:1667.89 E:0.080354 |  to get into the ground, but it's chaos and scary.
[4213.00 - 4216.00] P:1737.80 E:0.070171 |  We as fans were not late.
[4216.00 - 4221.00] P:1735.76 E:0.081398 |  I mean, look, Chris, it's certainly not for me to say whether or not you ever
[4221.00 - 4224.00] P:1712.06 E:0.078390 |  have said something which is right or wrong, but what I can say is,
[4224.00 - 4227.00] P:1866.10 E:0.074236 |  that wasn't our experience, was it?
[4227.00 - 4234.00] P:1793.32 E:0.087763 |  No, look, the issue which I saw was they were checking tickets on the outer perimeter,
[4234.00 - 4238.00] P:1718.02 E:0.081403 |  and there was just too many bodies there.
[4238.00 - 4240.00] P:1801.29 E:0.092947 |  There were thousands of fans all in a bottleneck,
[4240.00 - 4242.00] P:1762.32 E:0.083037 |  and they weren't checking the tickets quickly enough.
[4242.00 - 4244.00] P:1738.47 E:0.091107 |  There weren't enough bodies checking the tickets.
[4244.00 - 4248.00] P:1716.26 E:0.087132 |  And then there was Mayhem, there were people without tickets who were turning back
[4248.00 - 4251.00] P:1713.34 E:0.086991 |  and coming through the crowd, then there were people getting angry,
[4251.00 - 4255.00] P:1732.01 E:0.084624 |  a lot of pushing and shoving, and it became an issue.
[4255.00 - 4259.00] P:1801.34 E:0.073259 |  We were in there, and the one thing we can guarantee, Steve,
[4259.00 - 4265.00] P:1656.06 E:0.080692 |  is that this kick-off is not delayed because of the late arrival of Liverpool fans.
[4265.00 - 4270.00] P:1801.74 E:0.081888 |  Now, Liverpool fans were here, Liverpool fans might have not had any tickets,
[4270.00 - 4274.00] P:1845.12 E:0.085286 |  but this isn't delayed because of the late arrival of fans.
[4274.00 - 4278.00] P:1762.05 E:0.080055 |  The fans were there for whatever reason, and we don't know that.
[4278.00 - 4280.00] P:1711.97 E:0.068082 |  They just couldn't get through.
[4280.00 - 4285.00] P:1689.59 E:0.081366 |  Yeah, so, I mean, from a time perspective, it's 9 o'clock local time now,
[4285.00 - 4287.00] P:1768.72 E:0.081635 |  so this is when we were supposed to be kicking off.
[4287.00 - 4290.00] P:1817.04 E:0.075236 |  The first ball should have been kicked right now, as we speak.
[4290.00 - 4297.00] P:1670.06 E:0.078604 |  We got here local time at about 7.40, so that's getting on for an hour and a half ago,
[4297.00 - 4300.00] P:1834.38 E:0.077991 |  and it took us so long to get in because of a sea of fans.
[4300.00 - 4305.00] P:1649.03 E:0.075865 |  So, to say it's because of late fans' arrival, Jules, questionable, I would say.
[4305.00 - 4309.00] P:1488.12 E:0.086695 |  Absolutely, I arrived here at 6 o'clock, and already there were Liverpool fans,
[4309.00 - 4311.00] P:1639.79 E:0.086683 |  especially everywhere.
[4311.00 - 4314.00] P:1655.23 E:0.087908 |  I could see them when we left the periphery,
[4314.00 - 4317.00] P:1675.85 E:0.071614 |  and then we took the motorway to come here to the Stade de France.
[4317.00 - 4318.00] P:1281.35 E:0.111121 |  They were everywhere.
[4318.00 - 4323.00] P:1619.28 E:0.074288 |  Again, I don't think this is the problem that they arrived late.
[4323.00 - 4325.00] P:1508.85 E:0.087389 |  This is not true, because they were there.
[4325.00 - 4331.00] P:1784.67 E:0.076654 |  And again, if you had tickets, they were checking your tickets quite a long way out of the Stade de France.
[4331.00 - 4334.00] P:1832.11 E:0.091683 |  But there wasn't enough people there to check the tickets.
[4334.00 - 4336.00] P:1703.26 E:0.090118 |  That was taking a long, long time.
[4336.00 - 4337.00] P:1792.55 E:0.063187 |  Exactly, yeah.
[4337.00 - 4344.00] P:1776.47 E:0.071444 |  The idea of blaming fans right now feels pretty abhorrent, Jules.
[4344.00 - 4345.00] P:1713.00 E:0.067560 |  Yeah, completely.
[4345.00 - 4351.00] P:1814.98 E:0.081469 |  Again, I don't know if the police here and the security were prepared to see so many fans,
[4351.00 - 4354.00] P:1705.13 E:0.089828 |  maybe so many fans without tickets as well, coming just being around the Stade de France.
[4354.00 - 4356.00] P:1694.32 E:0.088834 |  Not all of them were trying to force in the ground,
[4356.00 - 4362.00] P:1757.32 E:0.077785 |  but maybe there was a feeling of fear from the police and from the security here.
[4362.00 - 4368.00] P:1794.82 E:0.077241 |  For all the big games that we mentioned, the National Team games here, the French Cup finals, etc.,
[4368.00 - 4371.00] P:1760.35 E:0.078881 |  usually they just have the people with tickets that turn up,
[4371.00 - 4375.00] P:1849.83 E:0.081690 |  not people without tickets that just want to be around the stadium to fill the atmosphere.
[4375.00 - 4378.00] P:1773.44 E:0.090273 |  And that has been part of the issue, Steve.
[4378.00 - 4384.00] P:1716.12 E:0.076995 |  I know you're talking about the poor treatment of fans,
[4384.00 - 4388.00] P:1798.29 E:0.079935 |  but the ticketless fans trying to get in, they're at disgrace.
[4388.00 - 4389.00] P:1927.45 E:0.083340 |  Absolutely.
[4389.00 - 4393.00] P:1732.05 E:0.076907 |  I think that what I'm being very, very careful with here is I'm thinking back to Wembley,
[4393.00 - 4399.00] P:1814.43 E:0.075891 |  when obviously the behaviour of some people, fans in the most inverted of commas,
[4399.00 - 4401.00] P:1928.41 E:0.088522 |  their behaviour was absolutely disgraceful.
[4401.00 - 4407.00] P:1874.65 E:0.082672 |  But I think by this stage, we'd already seen a lot of videos of fans pushing through barricades left, right and centre
[4407.00 - 4409.00] P:1623.71 E:0.058735 |  when it was Wembley.
[4409.00 - 4413.00] P:1720.52 E:0.079366 |  Nothing like that has happened that we've seen or aware of on this occasion.
[4413.00 - 4421.00] P:1659.86 E:0.080009 |  I think as well, the authorities are aware of the fact that there are so many people who've come to Paris without tickets.
[4421.00 - 4428.00] P:1672.08 E:0.084431 |  But that was the case in Seville, wasn't it, for the Europa League final with Antwerp, Frankfurt and with Rangers,
[4428.00 - 4431.00] P:1645.49 E:0.071486 |  and yet that match was able to get off on time.
[4431.00 - 4437.00] P:1801.29 E:0.085213 |  We can now speak to the BBC's Nick Parrott, who's actually, you know, they're not in his context as a journalist,
[4437.00 - 4439.00] P:1810.17 E:0.084455 |  but he can speak to us now when he's outside the ground.
[4439.00 - 4441.00] P:1949.21 E:0.070097 |  Nick, what are you seeing?
[4441.00 - 4449.00] P:1491.14 E:0.090011 |  Not very much, because I've just been satisfied with the first time in my life after having been matching regularly since 1994.
[4449.00 - 4456.00] P:1696.16 E:0.083300 |  I've been over the May of War, I've been to the Champions League finals before, I've never been satisfied before.
[4456.00 - 4460.00] P:1595.00 E:0.086766 |  I was outside Gate 5, where the gates are currently shut at the moment.
[4460.00 - 4466.00] P:1463.77 E:0.099146 |  They've been opening and closing repeatedly over the last hour and a half, but no one's been going through.
[4466.00 - 4472.00] P:1529.90 E:0.085769 |  And a few moments before you came to me, the security staff, the other side, advanced to the Liverpool fans,
[4472.00 - 4475.00] P:1567.45 E:0.066628 |  and he's had his break in discriminately.
[4475.00 - 4483.00] P:1527.69 E:0.092049 |  I have seen about 10 fans trying to climb over the fences, but they went all in Liverpool colours.
[4483.00 - 4487.00] P:1570.81 E:0.091729 |  Gate Zed is currently open, but there doesn't seem to be any movement going in.
[4487.00 - 4493.00] P:1624.31 E:0.090078 |  I've never seen this sort of chaos at any football match I've ever been to in a personal capacity.
[4493.00 - 4499.00] P:1506.49 E:0.075758 |  And quite frankly, I'm just utterly surprised the Liverpool fans are behaving themselves,
[4499.00 - 4503.00] P:1635.38 E:0.085906 |  and they've been trying to move themselves back from these gates and also try to get in.
[4503.00 - 4507.00] P:1695.58 E:0.063221 |  But the authorities just seem to be doing nothing.
[4507.00 - 4512.00] P:1789.54 E:0.074507 |  Nick, I don't know if you've seen this, but we've just had a statement from you away for a statement.
[4512.00 - 4518.00] P:1868.95 E:0.088282 |  It was on the big screen here inside the stadium saying that the game has been delayed due to the late arrival of Liverpool fans,
[4518.00 - 4523.00] P:1907.89 E:0.086485 |  which is something we're already questioning heavily and talking about here because of our own experiences.
[4523.00 - 4526.00] P:1737.76 E:0.059383 |  But when you read that, how does that make you feel?
[4526.00 - 4530.00] P:1732.93 E:0.097076 |  Well, it's not from late arrivals. I attempted to get into the stadium at 7 o'clock.
[4530.00 - 4536.00] P:1696.26 E:0.095487 |  I got through the first outer perimeter where there was crushing, which is being caused by the police.
[4536.00 - 4539.00] P:1704.00 E:0.094355 |  It was scary. I was being crushed and forced into other people.
[4539.00 - 4544.00] P:1758.61 E:0.088950 |  There were a number of security checks to get through there. So if anyone did have a fake ticket,
[4544.00 - 4547.00] P:1734.51 E:0.095325 |  I'm not quite sure how they got past that first security check.
[4547.00 - 4553.00] P:1700.70 E:0.096414 |  And then I came round in good time. I've been outside Gate Y since well before 8 o'clock,
[4553.00 - 4556.00] P:1488.08 E:0.091850 |  and it was quite clear we weren't going to get in before 9.
[4556.00 - 4562.00] P:1613.73 E:0.082864 |  And I can't see what's going to happen because my estimation is I can probably see about
[4562.00 - 4567.00] P:1605.10 E:0.095875 |  the thousands to 2,000 fans with Gate Z and a similar number at Gate Y.
[4567.00 - 4571.00] P:1658.98 E:0.091106 |  And there just seems to be no action in order to try to get the fans in.
[4571.00 - 4575.00] P:1666.63 E:0.088504 |  There's no communication to the fans. No one knows what's happening.
[4575.00 - 4579.00] P:1533.96 E:0.089241 |  And when they come out and spray you with pepper spray, it doesn't help the situation.
[4579.00 - 4585.00] P:1580.01 E:0.084593 |  I think the Liverpool fans have been extremely calm given the circumstances.
[4586.00 - 4592.00] P:1820.99 E:0.064602 |  Nick, what happened at that first check? What was the process that was going on?
[4592.00 - 4598.00] P:1772.10 E:0.088954 |  And how many people were there actually working on the checking of the passes?
[4598.00 - 4601.00] P:1753.02 E:0.070395 |  Sorry, I'm just trying to... Someone just tried to talk to me the same time.
[4601.00 - 4604.00] P:1618.76 E:0.088633 |  Can you say the question again? What was the first security check, right?
[4604.00 - 4608.00] P:1706.86 E:0.089324 |  At the first security check, how many staff were there?
[4610.00 - 4612.00] P:1524.11 E:0.092430 |  Well, there were probably about 40 police in total.
[4612.00 - 4615.00] P:1681.44 E:0.100561 |  There was only five checking tickets where I was checked.
[4615.00 - 4617.00] P:1737.04 E:0.099416 |  And then there was another check with five or so.
[4617.00 - 4620.00] P:1641.16 E:0.090432 |  And then another check again where you had a pat down.
[4620.00 - 4624.00] P:1455.51 E:0.085751 |  So I went to the Champions League final in Kiev back in 2018.
[4624.00 - 4627.00] P:1512.97 E:0.094351 |  And that was a very slick well-oiled machine.
[4627.00 - 4631.00] P:1634.10 E:0.095294 |  There was an outer perimeter that was at least 800 metres away from the stadium.
[4631.00 - 4633.00] P:1566.53 E:0.082472 |  Everything was well spaced out.
[4633.00 - 4636.00] P:1677.58 E:0.098261 |  There were barriers in that outer perimeter.
[4636.00 - 4641.00] P:1650.80 E:0.091790 |  It was all smooth. And you had your ticket tech before you went through the outer perimeter.
[4641.00 - 4644.00] P:1503.52 E:0.097219 |  Well, at the point of going through the outer perimeter.
[4644.00 - 4648.00] P:1618.83 E:0.091705 |  And then it was more like a normal football match experience when you got from stadium.
[4648.00 - 4651.00] P:1667.55 E:0.071490 |  Here it's just been chaos.
[4652.00 - 4656.00] P:1842.73 E:0.073324 |  The Liverpool players have actually just come out onto the pitch in front of us.
[4656.00 - 4658.00] P:1780.12 E:0.093997 |  We still don't know what time the game is going to kick off.
[4658.00 - 4661.00] P:1779.78 E:0.083782 |  But obviously they've got tired of being in the dressing room.
[4661.00 - 4665.00] P:1710.83 E:0.086876 |  So they're out there now to do almost a second warm-up with Jurgen Klopp.
[4665.00 - 4667.00] P:1894.09 E:0.085040 |  Nick, are you okay, by the way?
[4667.00 - 4670.00] P:2022.10 E:0.083244 |  You said right at the start there that you've been pepper sprayed.
[4670.00 - 4674.00] P:1720.12 E:0.085365 |  You were presumably a large number of people around you.
[4674.00 - 4676.00] P:1595.33 E:0.060315 |  Well, yeah, I'm okay now.
[4676.00 - 4679.00] P:1617.18 E:0.094253 |  I had to give a fan water to clear his eyes.
[4679.00 - 4682.00] P:1742.30 E:0.091766 |  He must have been closer to it than me because his eyes were screaming.
[4682.00 - 4686.00] P:1615.08 E:0.084892 |  It's an unpleasant experience that I don't really want to ever have again.
[4686.00 - 4693.00] P:1564.33 E:0.084786 |  I can't see how these fans are going to get in because Gates' bed has only got one gate open.
[4693.00 - 4695.00] P:1630.50 E:0.073010 |  And Gatewise still completely closed.
[4695.00 - 4700.00] P:1655.05 E:0.082524 |  And I can't see how the fans are going to get into the ground to go ahead.
[4700.00 - 4704.00] P:1738.05 E:0.092430 |  Surely the only situation that's going to pan out is he goes ahead without the fans.
[4704.00 - 4708.00] P:1443.49 E:0.079498 |  Or maybe even, I don't know if this could happen, be called off.
[4710.00 - 4713.00] P:2036.79 E:0.077856 |  How many fans can you see in and around you at the minute, Nick?
[4714.00 - 4717.00] P:1674.42 E:0.089157 |  Well, I'm positioned between Gatewise and Gates' bed.
[4717.00 - 4723.00] P:1535.86 E:0.085322 |  And it's hard to tell, but there's easily, I would think, a thousand of Gates' bed and a thousand of Gatewise.
[4723.00 - 4726.00] P:1807.95 E:0.084991 |  It could be as many as 1,500 at each gate.
[4726.00 - 4732.00] P:1606.92 E:0.080888 |  I think sometimes we've got sick of being there and we've practically tried to wander around to another entrance.
[4732.00 - 4736.00] P:1585.54 E:0.099963 |  But what we were being told earlier, or the rumor I was hearing earlier,
[4736.00 - 4740.00] P:1571.71 E:0.072037 |  was that you had to enter via the gate that was on your ticket.
[4741.00 - 4745.00] P:1669.94 E:0.086090 |  I'm looking at Gates' bed now and there doesn't seem to be any movement.
[4745.00 - 4747.00] P:1565.23 E:0.090039 |  When I was at Gatewise, there were fans coming out,
[4747.00 - 4754.00] P:1599.36 E:0.076783 |  but they seemed to be fans who'd been apprehended to possibly fake tickets or disorder.
[4755.00 - 4758.00] P:1834.74 E:0.077200 |  Nick, thank you very, very much for joining us.
[4758.00 - 4762.00] P:1734.19 E:0.084477 |  We, I think, are just hearing what time the kickoff will be, John.
[4762.00 - 4768.00] P:1428.88 E:0.087129 |  Yeah, this hasn't appeared on the screens in the stadium, but on our screens here in front of us,
[4768.00 - 4775.00] P:1546.67 E:0.078957 |  it says kickoff delayed to 9.30 local time, so that's 8.30 in the UK.
[4775.00 - 4781.00] P:1870.36 E:0.085288 |  Okay, so that is another 21 minutes from now that it seems like the Champions League final will kick off.
[4781.00 - 4784.00] P:1943.03 E:0.082171 |  Although, as Nick was just telling us, it seems to him,
[4784.00 - 4787.00] P:1732.33 E:0.083014 |  and this is consistent with the other reports that we've had here,
[4787.00 - 4791.00] P:1825.82 E:0.080118 |  that there are thousands of fans still hoping to get into the game.
[4791.00 - 4794.00] P:1713.08 E:0.083044 |  And I think, Alan, we're now in the position where, sadly,
[4794.00 - 4798.00] P:1771.48 E:0.085314 |  I think we can say with some confidence there are going to be a number of fans who do have tickets
[4798.00 - 4800.00] P:1821.88 E:0.084514 |  who won't be watching the Champions League final.
[4800.00 - 4803.00] P:1915.85 E:0.084405 |  Well, it looks that way because Julian mentioned it before,
[4803.00 - 4810.00] P:1812.60 E:0.090076 |  and still, again, looking at a lot of the gates and Zed and what he's been mentioning,
[4810.00 - 4813.00] P:1805.48 E:0.103670 |  there is still not a lot of movement of fans actually coming in.
[4813.00 - 4816.00] P:1835.44 E:0.092521 |  Still thousands of empty seats in the stadium,
[4816.00 - 4820.00] P:1790.48 E:0.084237 |  and if that is correct, that it does kick off at 9.30.
[4820.00 - 4824.00] P:1704.05 E:0.096129 |  That will be very unlikely, that all Liverpool fans will be in the stadium.
[4824.00 - 4827.00] P:1547.81 E:0.071955 |  I think the question will be asked, won't it,
[4827.00 - 4833.00] P:1549.79 E:0.076325 |  because it was so late in getting this final, whether that is a part of it.
[4833.00 - 4837.00] P:1702.72 E:0.068357 |  But I think, Julian, as you say, you know, there's one...
[4837.00 - 4841.00] P:1671.22 E:0.083808 |  I mean, this is one of the top stadiums in Europe for hosting events like this,
[4841.00 - 4844.00] P:1536.43 E:0.079025 |  and that was February, and this is the end of May.
[4844.00 - 4847.00] P:1496.58 E:0.083640 |  I mean, that has to be enough time to get your act together.
[4847.00 - 4850.00] P:1661.25 E:0.093330 |  100% and the elections are over now.
[4850.00 - 4853.00] P:1731.07 E:0.088794 |  There's Roland Garros, but that doesn't require a lot of police presence.
[4853.00 - 4855.00] P:1688.56 E:0.068089 |  It's a very different crowd, of course.
[4855.00 - 4859.00] P:1826.60 E:0.084036 |  So there's nothing else where security should be right now in Paris.
[4859.00 - 4863.00] P:1776.45 E:0.074893 |  Yes, they are in the fan zones, and rightly so again.
[4863.00 - 4865.00] P:1648.96 E:0.086038 |  But this is where I don't understand.
[4865.00 - 4871.00] P:1707.69 E:0.088943 |  Clearly, there was not enough policemen around, or certainly not used in the right way.
[4871.00 - 4873.00] P:1661.67 E:0.084788 |  And this is why we're here.
[4873.00 - 4876.00] P:1751.50 E:0.080647 |  It's interesting that Remedrius players haven't come out yet.
[4876.00 - 4879.00] P:1640.89 E:0.083095 |  It's only Liverpool, only the goalkeepers for Remedrius, Thibault Courtois,
[4879.00 - 4883.00] P:1648.60 E:0.077986 |  and Lune is number two.
[4883.00 - 4884.00] P:1854.39 E:0.093956 |  Are they on the pitch?
[4884.00 - 4887.00] P:1797.49 E:0.086909 |  Usually, you come to the dressing room 20 minutes before kick-off.
[4887.00 - 4891.00] P:1786.89 E:0.082146 |  There's 20 minutes before the new kick-off now, if you really kick-off at 9.30,
[4891.00 - 4896.00] P:1738.09 E:0.084046 |  because like Al said, there hasn't changed in the last half an hour.
[4896.00 - 4898.00] P:1437.79 E:0.089127 |  There's no more people now than there was half an hour ago
[4898.00 - 4900.00] P:1760.89 E:0.081416 |  when they delayed the kick-off the first time round.
[4900.00 - 4905.00] P:1795.09 E:0.084870 |  So I can't see why they're now saying 9.30, because for all we know,
[4905.00 - 4907.00] P:1648.00 E:0.083670 |  it might be exactly the same in another 20 minutes.
[4907.00 - 4910.00] P:1753.10 E:0.071338 |  Does that have to be a cut-off point though, for all this?
[4910.00 - 4913.00] P:1691.03 E:0.080483 |  You can't keep pushing back the kick-off.
[4913.00 - 4914.00] P:1514.56 E:0.086765 |  Exactly, yes.
[4914.00 - 4916.00] P:1421.25 E:0.076875 |  Yes, you are, maybe, maybe.
[4916.00 - 4918.00] P:1481.84 E:0.091122 |  And then you do it without those fans.
[4918.00 - 4919.00] P:1706.71 E:0.053964 |  I don't know.
[4919.00 - 4922.00] P:1742.27 E:0.083194 |  It's also very dangerous to start a game, and the fans are outside.
[4922.00 - 4924.00] P:1316.88 E:0.096574 |  They're going to get even more angry.
[4924.00 - 4928.00] P:1813.31 E:0.082863 |  They must be already frustrated, and that could even more trouble outside
[4928.00 - 4931.00] P:1803.32 E:0.086262 |  if they can hear kick-off, and if they know that the game is going on
[4931.00 - 4933.00] P:1709.79 E:0.075949 |  when they have tickets and they were not allowed in.
[4933.00 - 4938.00] P:1811.78 E:0.083248 |  And just put yourself in the position of fans who do have tickets
[4938.00 - 4940.00] P:1785.36 E:0.075526 |  and aren't allowed in.
[4940.00 - 4942.00] P:1671.69 E:0.083048 |  I mean, it's absolutely appalling.
[4942.00 - 4944.00] P:1725.94 E:0.091616 |  I've just seen this from Mark Pugatch on Twitter as well.
[4944.00 - 4947.00] P:1822.42 E:0.092276 |  He says, Liverpool fan Nick has told me four of the five gates
[4947.00 - 4949.00] P:1764.74 E:0.079967 |  they were walking towards were then shut.
[4949.00 - 4952.00] P:1730.43 E:0.079764 |  They were forced to funnel through just one gate.
[4952.00 - 4954.00] P:1684.96 E:0.088579 |  This is incomprehensible.
[4954.00 - 4956.00] P:1955.78 E:0.081467 |  Jules, we are obviously, as we're talking here,
[4956.00 - 4959.00] P:1930.81 E:0.090740 |  curiously looking at reports and speaking to people where we can who've been outside.
[4959.00 - 4961.00] P:1916.29 E:0.083099 |  What are the French press saying? What have you seen?
[4961.00 - 4964.00] P:1760.22 E:0.093195 |  They were repossed that tear gas was used by the police outside,
[4964.00 - 4967.00] P:1639.48 E:0.084180 |  which, again, is not verified.
[4967.00 - 4970.00] P:1820.38 E:0.079420 |  They've been trying to speak to UEFA,
[4970.00 - 4974.00] P:1608.52 E:0.086387 |  and UEFA, personally, said that the Real Madrid players are not coming out.
[4974.00 - 4976.00] P:1826.62 E:0.095885 |  But that they were issues at gates,
[4976.00 - 4979.00] P:1590.10 E:0.093155 |  that there were too many people trying to get into the stadium without tickets.
[4979.00 - 4982.00] P:1874.27 E:0.090452 |  Again, UEFA will always defend themselves by saying that.
[4982.00 - 4984.00] P:1851.68 E:0.086321 |  Saying it was not our fault.
[4984.00 - 4987.00] P:1779.02 E:0.072555 |  It was people without tickets that were trying to get in.
[4987.00 - 4989.00] P:1521.45 E:0.094823 |  I don't have many more information than that,
[4989.00 - 4991.00] P:1791.29 E:0.091589 |  and it seems that the French media don't know much more either.
[4991.00 - 4993.00] P:1899.38 E:0.089600 |  That's the point, though, Jules.
[4993.00 - 4996.00] P:1735.45 E:0.082349 |  We mentioned this before when we were speaking to Doug.
[4996.00 - 4999.00] P:1772.09 E:0.082915 |  That is what UEFA said after what happened at Wembley.
[4999.00 - 5000.00] P:1637.72 E:0.065496 |  Exactly.
[5000.00 - 5002.00] P:1786.92 E:0.090333 |  Once that's happened, can you use that saying excuse again?
[5002.00 - 5004.00] P:1787.68 E:0.088155 |  That is a question that people will ask.
[5004.00 - 5005.00] P:1422.00 E:0.086394 |  Completely.
[5005.00 - 5007.00] P:1605.63 E:0.085319 |  And I think people will have to give answers,
[5007.00 - 5009.00] P:1784.65 E:0.078938 |  because, again, this is not good enough.
[5009.00 - 5011.00] P:1621.72 E:0.088359 |  It's not good enough for the fans, as we've been saying,
[5011.00 - 5013.00] P:1826.63 E:0.084026 |  with tickets who are still outside, who might not even see this game,
[5013.00 - 5015.00] P:1647.68 E:0.081282 |  it's not good enough for the players.
[5015.00 - 5017.00] P:1792.92 E:0.077562 |  These are the best players in the world.
[5017.00 - 5019.00] P:1624.76 E:0.089616 |  You don't make the best players in the world,
[5019.00 - 5021.00] P:1675.93 E:0.077360 |  or any players in the world, for that matter,
[5021.00 - 5024.00] P:1807.28 E:0.082776 |  wait for their kickoff time when they've been preparing for this,
[5024.00 - 5025.00] P:1646.17 E:0.082147 |  for the whole season.
[5025.00 - 5027.00] P:1432.32 E:0.084744 |  They've been waiting for this the whole season,
[5027.00 - 5029.00] P:1843.25 E:0.075301 |  and now you're almost taking this a little bit off them,
[5029.00 - 5032.00] P:1812.77 E:0.091515 |  because you say, you know what, we messed up here,
[5032.00 - 5034.00] P:1660.52 E:0.094848 |  we're not ready, so you're going to have to wait for us
[5034.00 - 5037.00] P:1787.41 E:0.077057 |  to sort all of this out before you can play the biggest game
[5037.00 - 5039.00] P:1773.49 E:0.081841 |  for some of them in their career.
[5039.00 - 5040.00] P:1827.42 E:0.065079 |  This is outrageous.
[5040.00 - 5042.00] P:2021.20 E:0.076676 |  Just again, looking at social media, Gary Lennick has said,
[5042.00 - 5044.00] P:1788.57 E:0.080175 |  I'm not sure it's possible to have a more poorly organised event
[5044.00 - 5047.00] P:1747.61 E:0.089504 |  if you try absolutely shambolic and dangerous.
[5047.00 - 5050.00] P:1757.26 E:0.089614 |  There is now an announcement being made, as we speak,
[5050.00 - 5053.00] P:1874.85 E:0.090446 |  right now in the stadium, and you can hear the noise
[5053.00 - 5056.00] P:1990.89 E:0.090414 |  the fans are making, and part of that will be because
[5056.00 - 5058.00] P:1964.23 E:0.077603 |  of their reaction to the announcement that you waived
[5058.00 - 5061.00] P:1857.50 E:0.091212 |  for previously made here, when they said that the reason
[5061.00 - 5063.00] P:1831.89 E:0.083241 |  for the game not starting on time was due to the arrival
[5063.00 - 5064.00] P:1657.32 E:0.081602 |  of late fans.
[5064.00 - 5066.00] P:1710.26 E:0.092465 |  This is what they've now said.
[5066.00 - 5068.00] P:1907.09 E:0.096056 |  Again, it says, due to the late arrival of fans,
[5068.00 - 5070.00] P:1685.67 E:0.077808 |  the match has been delayed.
[5070.00 - 5074.00] P:1826.30 E:0.078772 |  Further information will follow in 15 minutes maximum.
[5074.00 - 5076.00] P:1878.44 E:0.095723 |  So still no confirmation for people in the ground, John,
[5076.00 - 5079.00] P:1790.42 E:0.074909 |  that this is going to kick off in 15 minutes time.
[5079.00 - 5082.00] P:1431.19 E:0.101383 |  Yeah, unless I've missed something, the people who are here
[5082.00 - 5086.00] P:1554.74 E:0.078561 |  inside the stadium have not been told yet that the plan is
[5086.00 - 5091.00] P:1588.12 E:0.069872 |  for a kick-off at half past.
[5091.00 - 5094.00] P:1805.67 E:0.077643 |  At this though, Chris Sutton, when you look down on the pitch,
[5094.00 - 5097.00] P:1789.62 E:0.076444 |  is exactly what the players would be doing with 15 minutes to go.
[5097.00 - 5099.00] P:1763.47 E:0.087534 |  They would be coming to the end of their warm-up,
[5099.00 - 5101.00] P:1591.67 E:0.075854 |  which I suspect they are now doing for the second time.
[5101.00 - 5104.00] P:1619.89 E:0.098346 |  Do you know, I find it really interesting at this moment in time
[5104.00 - 5108.00] P:1730.83 E:0.087938 |  because if we get to half past and there is no kick-off,
[5108.00 - 5110.00] P:1734.98 E:0.099435 |  they can only warm up for so long.
[5110.00 - 5113.00] P:1471.76 E:0.074788 |  Eventually there does have to be a cut-off point.
[5113.00 - 5116.00] P:1678.90 E:0.073691 |  Let's hope it kicks off at half past, but of course,
[5116.00 - 5120.00] P:1703.84 E:0.079250 |  it doesn't look to us like there are any more live-of-all fans
[5120.00 - 5121.00] P:1714.39 E:0.071385 |  getting into the stadium.
[5121.00 - 5126.00] P:1619.60 E:0.082781 |  No, those gates, Y and Z, still look very quiet
[5126.00 - 5128.00] P:1831.74 E:0.074291 |  in terms of people coming in.
[5128.00 - 5131.00] P:1645.43 E:0.082248 |  It does seem static in terms of the numbers
[5131.00 - 5132.00] P:1379.63 E:0.092845 |  of how many people are in the ground
[5132.00 - 5134.00] P:1581.33 E:0.088201 |  and how many empty-gray seats we can see.
[5134.00 - 5137.00] P:1701.13 E:0.082858 |  The other thing as well, to return to the main story
[5137.00 - 5140.00] P:1794.74 E:0.084776 |  with regard to the team and the match in Thiago,
[5140.00 - 5144.00] P:1619.32 E:0.079384 |  he has come out with Liverpool and he is warming up vigorously again.
[5144.00 - 5148.00] P:1714.88 E:0.078299 |  So it looks like he's not yet been ruled out, Thiago.
[5148.00 - 5151.00] P:1770.48 E:0.087184 |  Can I just say, Steve, quickly, the statement which you are using
[5151.00 - 5156.00] P:1670.49 E:0.086241 |  on the big screen about, you know, because of fans arriving late,
[5156.00 - 5159.00] P:1662.02 E:0.069934 |  and we've said this before, that's very unfair.
[5159.00 - 5162.00] P:1692.05 E:0.083993 |  There's going to be a lot of angry fans outside the stadium.
[5162.00 - 5164.00] P:1827.06 E:0.080219 |  Absolutely, completely agree with that.
[5164.00 - 5167.00] P:1779.24 E:0.087567 |  They certainly will be, because as we've said a couple of times now,
[5167.00 - 5171.00] P:1790.76 E:0.086479 |  when we arrived at the stadium, which was over two and a half hours ago,
[5171.00 - 5173.00] P:1564.98 E:0.075958 |  there were already loads of fans here.
[5173.00 - 5176.00] P:1793.84 E:0.080478 |  So it's not a case that fans have turned up at the last minute.
[5176.00 - 5179.00] P:1621.65 E:0.076665 |  That is something that we can say with absolute confidence.
[5179.00 - 5182.00] P:1859.37 E:0.078590 |  So we've got Juliana Ron, Chris Sutton, Alan Shearer,
[5182.00 - 5184.00] P:1720.59 E:0.090845 |  correspondent John Murray, all with us.
[5184.00 - 5186.00] P:1929.35 E:0.081268 |  There's still no official announcement.
[5186.00 - 5191.00] P:1746.36 E:0.076881 |  We are expecting that the Champions League final will kick off in 15 minutes time,
[5191.00 - 5194.00] P:1743.70 E:0.083128 |  whether it does or not, of course, is another question.
[5194.00 - 5198.00] P:1801.88 E:0.078933 |  I wonder actually, Alan, you know, to talk about the football for a bit,
[5198.00 - 5201.00] P:1718.70 E:0.079701 |  because, you know, I think that there is a time when we'll start doing that again
[5201.00 - 5203.00] P:1751.92 E:0.078593 |  and we'll continue to keep everybody updated.
[5203.00 - 5206.00] P:1769.70 E:0.084399 |  I just wonder if what that delay has done
[5206.00 - 5209.00] P:1852.23 E:0.081102 |  might have changed Jurgen Klopp's mind on Thiago,
[5209.00 - 5212.00] P:1947.73 E:0.078487 |  because it certainly looked like he wasn't going to play.
[5212.00 - 5215.00] P:1754.44 E:0.068150 |  It looked like he was having the chat with Keita to say, you're starting.
[5215.00 - 5219.00] P:1672.86 E:0.094083 |  Yeah, and looking at the players that are warming up
[5219.00 - 5224.00] P:1778.53 E:0.087174 |  in terms of getting ready for the match and just going in there,
[5224.00 - 5227.00] P:1686.88 E:0.094748 |  then that looks as if it's a start and a ten without the goalkeeper.
[5227.00 - 5231.00] P:1628.75 E:0.094788 |  And Thiago isn't looking as if he is in that group there.
[5231.00 - 5234.00] P:1690.91 E:0.089490 |  The cheer in the background is for two reasons.
[5234.00 - 5237.00] P:1704.50 E:0.099702 |  The players are ending their warm-up and also Rafa Nadal's name
[5237.00 - 5241.00] P:1626.88 E:0.086188 |  is now being chanted by the fans here inside the Stade de France.
[5241.00 - 5245.00] P:1688.30 E:0.091713 |  He, quite fortuitously for him, is not playing in the French Open today.
[5245.00 - 5249.00] P:1639.07 E:0.083425 |  He won his latest match yesterday, so he has been able to get here and attend the game.
[5249.00 - 5252.00] P:1763.76 E:0.089827 |  But as we were told when we were getting into the stadium,
[5252.00 - 5257.00] P:1890.22 E:0.086601 |  absolutely everybody was delayed getting in and it looks like he's just arrived as well.
[5257.00 - 5259.00] P:1844.51 E:0.090937 |  Looking away to our right-hand side then, again,
[5259.00 - 5263.00] P:1937.69 E:0.081131 |  just trying to get a feel of how many Liverpool fans might still be to come in.
[5263.00 - 5265.00] P:1893.38 E:0.092901 |  And it really is clear, John.
[5265.00 - 5269.00] P:1869.29 E:0.086363 |  It really is clear when you look to your right-hand side,
[5269.00 - 5273.00] P:1832.10 E:0.080882 |  the discrepancy still between the number of Liverpool fans that have not got in
[5273.00 - 5275.00] P:1703.15 E:0.081147 |  and the number of Real Madrid fans that have.
[5275.00 - 5277.00] P:1630.14 E:0.088034 |  It seems to be particularly so.
[5277.00 - 5280.00] P:1479.61 E:0.090790 |  I would say in that middle section of the three tiers,
[5280.00 - 5283.00] P:1649.56 E:0.082981 |  the middle section and round about the areas,
[5283.00 - 5288.00] P:1656.07 E:0.091406 |  as we heard from our BBC colleague Nick outside the ground in those areas,
[5288.00 - 5291.00] P:1707.10 E:0.069426 |  why and to a lesser extent Zed.
[5291.00 - 5298.00] P:1704.41 E:0.088974 |  So, you know, we are now less than 15 minutes away from kick-off.
[5298.00 - 5305.00] P:1719.27 E:0.081908 |  And I guess that UEFA have told the two teams that they could have a certain amount of time
[5305.00 - 5307.00] P:1590.82 E:0.094470 |  to go through another warm-up routine.
[5307.00 - 5309.00] P:1856.40 E:0.083395 |  Jürgen Klopp actually ran off the pitch with them
[5309.00 - 5313.00] P:1620.87 E:0.082574 |  and led them back down the tunnel into the dressing room area.
[5313.00 - 5317.00] P:1716.36 E:0.071073 |  So I suppose the next indicator actually will be
[5317.00 - 5321.00] P:1767.44 E:0.081951 |  if the pre-natch ceremony in Camilla Cabello gets underway.
[5321.00 - 5326.00] P:1691.47 E:0.085263 |  I think that will be a clear indicator that they are planning to start in, what, 12 minutes time then?
[5326.00 - 5333.00] P:1805.06 E:0.076041 |  Which will be a such a shame because there's so many empty seats in that Liverpool section,
[5333.00 - 5335.00] P:1888.14 E:0.109709 |  that middle section that you were on about.
[5335.00 - 5340.00] P:1724.53 E:0.081854 |  I mean, I just feel so sorry for them after what everyone's been through.
[5340.00 - 5344.00] P:1898.11 E:0.081127 |  After everyone has worked so hard to get here,
[5344.00 - 5349.00] P:1844.04 E:0.081568 |  the guys with everyone with tickets to actually make it to the stadium
[5349.00 - 5353.00] P:1800.77 E:0.089969 |  and not be allowed in through no fault of their own is an absolute disgrace.
[5353.00 - 5357.00] P:1703.86 E:0.085097 |  And there's every chance as well, if they hear that, which they will do,
[5357.00 - 5362.00] P:1546.52 E:0.085218 |  the word will get outside and it seems like the match is about to start and they can't get in.
[5362.00 - 5364.00] P:1636.35 E:0.084074 |  I mean, that is going to add to the anger.
[5364.00 - 5366.00] P:1783.42 E:0.080036 |  That is exactly what I was about to ask actually, John,
[5366.00 - 5369.00] P:1643.52 E:0.081668 |  because I was wondering why on Earth you ever wouldn't have announced the kick-off
[5369.00 - 5371.00] P:1697.46 E:0.073824 |  if it is going to be at half past.
[5371.00 - 5375.00] P:1744.45 E:0.085038 |  That's probably, you know, that might well be the reason that what they don't want to do
[5375.00 - 5378.00] P:1791.51 E:0.076071 |  is to make people even more desperate.
[5378.00 - 5384.00] P:1727.55 E:0.077481 |  There's now an update on our screen which says kick-off delayed to 21.36.
[5384.00 - 5389.00] P:1620.40 E:0.077568 |  So that is putting another six minutes on the kick-off time.
[5389.00 - 5394.00] P:1691.25 E:0.079598 |  So that is what, 18 minutes away, 17 minutes away from where we are now.
[5394.00 - 5398.00] P:1732.90 E:0.085006 |  OK, a 36 minute pass kick-off.
[5398.00 - 5402.00] P:1717.98 E:0.075261 |  36 minutes past is apparently when the game will kick off.
[5402.00 - 5405.00] P:1811.73 E:0.083608 |  I mean, again, look, what's happening outside the stadium.
[5405.00 - 5412.00] P:1863.77 E:0.075803 |  Them getting that organised and making sure that the fans and anybody outside the stadium is safe
[5412.00 - 5417.00] P:1811.90 E:0.079911 |  is far more important, but a drip feed of information actually isn't really good for anybody
[5417.00 - 5421.00] P:1715.26 E:0.080607 |  because we're in this position where people outside, some of whom do have tickets,
[5421.00 - 5424.00] P:1673.04 E:0.080958 |  will be in this exact same scenario.
[5424.00 - 5427.00] P:1633.66 E:0.087897 |  I've just seen the Brazilian Ronaldo enter the stadium just above us,
[5427.00 - 5430.00] P:1614.03 E:0.081769 |  and he got a cheer from the Real Madrid fans.
[5430.00 - 5433.00] P:1876.09 E:0.076243 |  So by any chance you've just joined us, just to tell you what's happened,
[5433.00 - 5438.00] P:1594.83 E:0.080510 |  you know, we should be now about 20 minutes into the Champions League final,
[5438.00 - 5444.00] P:1570.03 E:0.077827 |  and we're not because of trouble that fans have had to get into the stadium.
[5444.00 - 5449.00] P:1542.00 E:0.080495 |  And we've been speculating via UEFA statements when the game will kick off.
[5449.00 - 5455.00] P:1631.51 E:0.081331 |  There still hasn't been an announcement. However, John Murray, the opening ceremony is now beginning.
[5455.00 - 5460.00] P:1365.98 E:0.089491 |  Yeah, so this must be why the plan is now to kick off at 21.36,
[5460.00 - 5464.00] P:1287.37 E:0.089662 |  which is in what 16 minutes time from now.
[5464.00 - 5467.00] P:1376.27 E:0.091027 |  So they've begun the opening ceremony, such as it is,
[5467.00 - 5471.00] P:1326.89 E:0.087343 |  and a huge blue carpet has been rolled out across the pitch.
[5471.00 - 5477.00] P:1341.92 E:0.081996 |  And I can see the floor managers down on the side of the field are counting down
[5477.00 - 5482.00] P:1139.07 E:0.091995 |  the start of the act that Cabeo will do over on the far side.
[5482.00 - 5486.00] P:1347.77 E:0.088113 |  And as well, I see that the European Cup itself actually has been walked out
[5486.00 - 5493.00] P:1267.60 E:0.077270 |  and placed on a tall, transparent plinth just in front of the tunnel
[5493.00 - 5499.00] P:1506.71 E:0.085961 |  and ahead of the carpet that leads out onto the pitch with the image of the European Cup on it
[5499.00 - 5502.00] P:1446.97 E:0.090611 |  and the Champions League logo as well.
[5502.00 - 5507.00] P:1621.48 E:0.099197 |  Giulia LaRonde, John Murray, Alan Shearer, Chris Sutton with us inside the stand to France.
[5507.00 - 5511.00] P:1601.73 E:0.097820 |  We're going to keep you updated on everything that's happening outside as we hear more about it.
[5511.00 - 5516.00] P:1735.76 E:0.092809 |  Our engineer, O.I., has just done the job of trying to count as much as he can
[5516.00 - 5519.00] P:1514.95 E:0.095702 |  how many empty seats we can see around us to the right-hand side.
[5519.00 - 5525.00] P:1562.71 E:0.093187 |  His estimate is roughly 2,000, and that's in line with everything that we are hearing.
[5525.00 - 5530.00] P:1465.47 E:0.093558 |  So it's 21 minutes past 9 local time. I wouldn't normally be that precise,
[5530.00 - 5536.00] P:1399.51 E:0.088029 |  but that's because we have an oddly precise kickoff time of 21.36.
[5536.00 - 5541.00] P:1502.93 E:0.088761 |  So that appears is when the Champions League final is going to start.
[5541.00 - 5545.00] P:1868.75 E:0.098332 |  Giulia LaRonde, I appreciate you have your own job to do as well.
[5545.00 - 5550.00] P:1722.73 E:0.087885 |  Thank you very much for being with us, and we will speak to you again, I'm sure.
[5550.00 - 5553.00] P:1817.46 E:0.103830 |  That is Giulia LaRonde. I'll tell you what we will do then.
[5553.00 - 5558.00] P:1558.90 E:0.083506 |  We'll bring you one of the interviews we plan to bring you, which is actually about the football.
[5558.00 - 5563.00] P:1743.39 E:0.088576 |  And it's about a player who we know is starting in this game, and that is Venisius Jr.,
[5563.00 - 5569.00] P:1637.77 E:0.085293 |  the Real Madrid winger, and his battle with Trent Alexander-Arnold should be absolutely fascinating.
[5569.00 - 5573.00] P:1614.25 E:0.093747 |  Steve McMahonman played for both clubs. He won the Champions League with Real Madrid.
[5573.00 - 5577.00] P:1680.56 E:0.074074 |  He says he's relishing the chance to watch Venisius in action.
[5577.00 - 5579.00] P:1364.33 E:0.101082 |  He's really come to the fore this year, hasn't he?
[5579.00 - 5585.00] P:1405.80 E:0.090811 |  As much as he's been at Madrid for a number of years, he has really emerged as a real important player.
[5585.00 - 5589.00] P:1396.01 E:0.079824 |  You wouldn't say it's his breakthrough year, because he's been around for a number of years,
[5589.00 - 5595.00] P:1568.01 E:0.084604 |  but he's really excelled this year, and he's added goals, and he's added more assists in his relationship with Kareem's being excellent, hasn't he?
[5595.00 - 5601.00] P:1612.47 E:0.087205 |  Do you think that that's to do with him, or is it also to do with the fact that presumably that Real Madrid shirt,
[5601.00 - 5603.00] P:1434.50 E:0.073781 |  when you first put it on, could be quite heavy?
[5603.00 - 5607.00] P:1408.39 E:0.087604 |  Yeah, he came as a baby, didn't he? And people have to settle in, and people have to adapt.
[5607.00 - 5612.00] P:1151.64 E:0.083350 |  When you come as an 18-year-old, or whatever age it was, and for the large sum of money,
[5612.00 - 5617.00] P:1508.46 E:0.086173 |  there's a huge amount of expectation on you, and sometimes you just can't do it straight away,
[5617.00 - 5622.00] P:1487.08 E:0.090236 |  it's just a baby. And when you come to a team like Real Madrid, there is a huge expectation on you straight away.
[5622.00 - 5627.00] P:1487.32 E:0.092669 |  There's a huge expectation on Camervinga, for instance, and he looks if he's going to be a superstar as well.
[5627.00 - 5631.00] P:1597.36 E:0.084732 |  Winger to winger, what do you most admire about him? What gets you off your seat when he gets the ball?
[5631.00 - 5635.00] P:1576.74 E:0.093586 |  I just like the fact that he's very direct, he drops his shoulder, he takes people on, he's like a traditional winger.
[5635.00 - 5642.00] P:1360.79 E:0.078260 |  You don't see them many a lot now. So anybody who drops the shoulder and can go past people,
[5642.00 - 5648.00] P:1359.04 E:0.077183 |  I think that's great. I think he'll have to evolve, and he'll have to play on the right,
[5648.00 - 5652.00] P:1285.08 E:0.083153 |  and he'll have to go both ways, and things like that. That's how you become better and better and better,
[5652.00 - 5657.00] P:1536.30 E:0.081532 |  and keep defenders guessing. You can't just chop one way all the time, but he's quick, he's talented,
[5657.00 - 5663.00] P:1412.09 E:0.080566 |  he's very, very skillful, and he's young, and he's got an appetite to mature and to grow and become a better player.
[5663.00 - 5665.00] P:1724.14 E:0.087931 |  I thought it was interesting, in Trent's press conference, he was asked about Vinicius,
[5665.00 - 5669.00] P:1753.10 E:0.079888 |  he was looking forward to playing it, and it was a really strong, absolutely.
[5669.00 - 5673.00] P:1290.63 E:0.090324 |  Well, Clio Orch was brilliant against them, wasn't he? Clio Orch was brilliant until he had to go off,
[5673.00 - 5679.00] P:1419.20 E:0.073974 |  and it turned into a really good competition, because people now think that's an area which they will try and play.
[5679.00 - 5684.00] P:1470.75 E:0.082946 |  Neto played in that area against Wolsey, the game was excellent before he came off.
[5684.00 - 5690.00] P:1398.17 E:0.080206 |  Carlo played like that at Stamford Bridge, didn't he, against Christensen. Trent's played there before,
[5690.00 - 5694.00] P:1621.67 E:0.083150 |  Vinicius scored from that area last year, with the Alfrid at the Stephanus Stadium,
[5694.00 - 5701.00] P:1442.59 E:0.074449 |  so you can see why people want to speak about Trent, and Vinicius, you know, Trent's just an incredible football player, isn't he?
[5701.00 - 5705.00] P:1735.66 E:0.087933 |  And they won't be that naive to suggest that we're going to go and leave loads of space for Vinicius Jr.
[5705.00 - 5706.00] P:1470.74 E:0.087127 |  I mean, that's just bonkers.
[5706.00 - 5712.00] P:1803.42 E:0.074725 |  Also, I think like, if people are saying that the way Real Madrid can get at Liverpool is via Trent Alexander-Arnold,
[5712.00 - 5715.00] P:1609.76 E:0.078682 |  that probably highlights something quite good about Liverpool.
[5715.00 - 5721.00] P:1508.00 E:0.085066 |  Well, exactly, exactly. People have mentioned that to me, and I, you know, yes, it's an area that you think you would be trying to exploit,
[5721.00 - 5725.00] P:1184.28 E:0.073394 |  but, you know, you're going to know the players know that that's where they want to play, don't they?
[5725.00 - 5729.00] P:1429.77 E:0.094187 |  They know that if Ferri Valverde plays, Vinicius and Benzemaal are play-off fronts,
[5729.00 - 5733.00] P:1438.71 E:0.084924 |  and Vinicius play on the left and Benzemaal through the centre, so then you have to try and isolate,
[5733.00 - 5738.00] P:1416.14 E:0.092556 |  or, you know, it might be Andy Robertson's day to excel, you know, and that's just team football.
[5738.00 - 5739.00] P:1415.93 E:0.073352 |  There's no problem with that.
[5740.00 - 5744.00] P:1566.66 E:0.115073 |  That's Steve McMahonamann, and we're going to go back to the story of what's happening outside the stadium
[5744.00 - 5747.00] P:1520.88 E:0.108766 |  and completely ignore the opening ceremony, because it really doesn't matter.
[5747.00 - 5751.00] P:1522.16 E:0.110602 |  Don't think for the mailers, join us again. Don't... What have you seen outside?
[5751.00 - 5756.00] P:1361.54 E:0.098574 |  Yeah, so, Steve, we went back out to Tairn Style White, which is right behind the Liverpool end,
[5756.00 - 5761.00] P:1310.07 E:0.104678 |  where the Liverpool supporters are trying to get in, spoken to a number of them, an ex-war of experience.
[5761.00 - 5766.00] P:1634.90 E:0.090549 |  They're being pepper sprayed by French police. There's kids in the queue, there's old people in the queue,
[5766.00 - 5771.00] P:1470.68 E:0.084541 |  who've done nothing, they've been there for two hours, and know they've been pepper sprayed, Steve,
[5771.00 - 5773.00] P:1583.06 E:0.092336 |  because I've felt it myself.
[5773.00 - 5778.00] P:1595.84 E:0.095157 |  A number of my colleagues who have gone to have a look at the story, they've felt the effects of it.
[5778.00 - 5781.00] P:1665.37 E:0.091885 |  They came from nowhere. It's all just dispersed on it.
[5783.00 - 5787.00] P:1589.82 E:0.091682 |  The anger that the people feel in terms of how they've been treated.
[5787.00 - 5795.00] P:1661.28 E:0.081644 |  I need to get this point across. There's no violence or anti-agonism from Liverpool fans.
[5795.00 - 5799.00] P:1636.81 E:0.090240 |  They're just absolutely dismayed with how the authorities have treated them.
[5799.00 - 5802.00] P:1433.57 E:0.090379 |  They've been there, like, they've got to the stadium in good time.
[5803.00 - 5809.00] P:1527.02 E:0.089029 |  As I said to you before, there's people trying to get pickpockets, trying to go around and take tickets and one thing another.
[5809.00 - 5814.00] P:1601.81 E:0.096562 |  The anger of the people that have spoken to is not like any of the other experience.
[5814.00 - 5820.00] P:1564.61 E:0.096316 |  It's a failing of the authorities and the police in terms of how they're being looked after outside.
[5820.00 - 5825.00] P:1744.02 E:0.101492 |  We were just having the conversation before, when we were making Wembley comparisons to say,
[5825.00 - 5831.00] P:1882.17 E:0.093331 |  by this tenth time on that night, you know, you had videos of people running through barricades and all this kind of thing.
[5831.00 - 5838.00] P:1783.70 E:0.089004 |  This is what makes this entirely different. The idea of blaming any fans is pretty nauseating, isn't it?
[5838.00 - 5843.00] P:1769.68 E:0.089968 |  Yeah, it is. It's a great point. There have been some fans that have tried to get in.
[5843.00 - 5849.00] P:1542.11 E:0.098286 |  I wouldn't even, I wouldn't be disingenuous to stand here and talk to you and say that hasn't been the case.
[5849.00 - 5852.00] P:1618.50 E:0.095595 |  I've seen people, I've seen people try to get in.
[5852.00 - 5857.00] P:1699.73 E:0.091580 |  But I'm talking one, two, not like groups or anything like Wembley.
[5857.00 - 5863.00] P:1673.35 E:0.087952 |  This is entirely treatment in one direction.
[5863.00 - 5868.00] P:1833.64 E:0.092302 |  Don, you said you could feel it as well. You know, that must have been really difficult,
[5868.00 - 5872.00] P:1881.11 E:0.096371 |  not just to feel it to yourself, but what you've actually witnessed there as well, especially with young kids.
[5872.00 - 5884.00] P:1538.31 E:0.094480 |  Yeah, the anger of people and mothers who've got the kids with them and older people who've been following them around for years,
[5884.00 - 5890.00] P:1426.73 E:0.094021 |  you know, there was faces out there that I see going around Europe for these games.
[5890.00 - 5894.00] P:1465.49 E:0.089459 |  They're not, they've got people, they're here for the matter to enjoy themselves.
[5894.00 - 5898.00] P:1649.10 E:0.100143 |  So what was the emotion then amongst them? Was it upset? Was it anger?
[5898.00 - 5904.00] P:1688.94 E:0.086138 |  Anger, this may, shock. I mean, the pepper spray came from nowhere.
[5904.00 - 5908.00] P:1659.23 E:0.088630 |  It was like everybody started coughing at the same time. It was like, what's happening here?
[5908.00 - 5913.00] P:1831.21 E:0.105160 |  I think looking to our right now, it's certainly looking as if it is filling up a little bit more.
[5913.00 - 5920.00] P:1839.74 E:0.100989 |  There's a good few hundred empty seats still, but thankfully it seems as if that there's a lot more Liverpool fans
[5920.00 - 5926.00] P:1867.37 E:0.097767 |  arrived in the last five or ten minutes or so, which seems to be the case and good news.
[5926.00 - 5931.00] P:1901.42 E:0.096460 |  Let's get more from outside the stadium as well now, because Nick Parrott has rejoined us.
[5931.00 - 5937.00] P:2012.00 E:0.085651 |  Nick, you were telling us earlier that you yourself had felt the pepper spray. What can you see right now?
[5937.00 - 5942.00] P:1743.11 E:0.091595 |  Well, I can see a lot of riot police, they came out, chased this.
[5942.00 - 5946.00] P:1707.26 E:0.086894 |  I got chased from Gate 7 down to Gate Y, which is where I was originally.
[5946.00 - 5952.00] P:1616.42 E:0.091996 |  They don't seem to be any fans getting in from here. There are fewer fans here than when you last faced me,
[5952.00 - 5955.00] P:1439.19 E:0.079789 |  but I think they must have gone round to other sides of the ground.
[5955.00 - 5959.00] P:1603.58 E:0.099637 |  I've seen at least two Liverpool fans on the floor being treated by medics.
[5959.00 - 5965.00] P:1433.65 E:0.080300 |  The effects of tear gas. There's a riot police line at Gate 7.
[5965.00 - 5969.00] P:1513.45 E:0.096022 |  They have moved down the side of the safety penalty by the broadcast compound,
[5969.00 - 5974.00] P:1615.26 E:0.085520 |  and there are riot police the other side of the gate, which we haven't seen earlier.
[5974.00 - 5981.00] P:1603.07 E:0.089674 |  I'm right outside Gate Y, I don't know, a Gate Y has only one gate open, but no one is going through.
[5981.00 - 5987.00] P:1767.97 E:0.095629 |  Gate 7, I can only just about say it seems to be the same situation as earlier where there's one gate, but no one coming in.
[5987.00 - 5992.00] P:1796.43 E:0.083707 |  The only people who have been going through the gate are riot police coming on the way out.
[5993.00 - 5998.00] P:2006.19 E:0.083518 |  Nick, how concentrated are the fans that you're around right now?
[5998.00 - 6005.00] P:1836.73 E:0.089346 |  We've heard a lot of reports of people being pushed in together as well, while this pepper spray has happened.
[6005.00 - 6007.00] P:1881.55 E:0.081095 |  So what is the situation at the moment?
[6007.00 - 6013.00] P:1543.13 E:0.096895 |  Well, what happened with the pepper spray between Gate Y and Gate 7 was a gate was open for a disabled person.
[6013.00 - 6018.00] P:1522.98 E:0.096021 |  From my vantage point, I couldn't see whether that person was being allowed in or being taken out,
[6018.00 - 6024.00] P:1463.90 E:0.076997 |  but a group of fans surged to get in, and this pepper spray was sprayed at them.
[6024.00 - 6030.00] P:1471.76 E:0.099348 |  It was almost in like a watering can type thing that you'd have on your garden for spraying your plants.
[6030.00 - 6037.00] P:1527.44 E:0.100985 |  And that was being released by what appeared to be an official in civilian clothing, as opposed to a police officer.
[6037.00 - 6039.00] P:1582.15 E:0.084959 |  And it was being sprayed indiscriminately.
[6039.00 - 6044.00] P:1495.04 E:0.093746 |  It's almost like a pesticide being sprayed over bugs to get them to go away.
[6044.00 - 6047.00] P:1353.20 E:0.093660 |  It's quite a strange sight, not seen anything like that before in the football match.
[6049.00 - 6050.00] P:1659.29 E:0.058120 |  Tom?
[6050.00 - 6053.00] P:1520.65 E:0.088354 |  Yeah, I actually seen a police officer doing it.
[6053.00 - 6059.00] P:1496.79 E:0.090286 |  There was one police officer who had done it because the fans that I was trying to speak to were in absolute uproar on him.
[6059.00 - 6064.00] P:1409.89 E:0.067554 |  They couldn't believe what he'd done. It was just indiscriminate.
[6064.00 - 6070.00] P:1515.90 E:0.083066 |  You could understand if they were going for strong arm tactics, if something was sinister outside.
[6070.00 - 6075.00] P:1582.01 E:0.077464 |  It wasn't. They were just genuinely upset wanting to be in because there was no organisation.
[6076.00 - 6078.00] P:1711.84 E:0.090657 |  Can you hear the anger in your voice as well?
[6078.00 - 6084.00] P:1433.69 E:0.067859 |  You know, these people have saved up, you know, a lot.
[6084.00 - 6088.00] P:1410.24 E:0.079110 |  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, as I said to you before.
[6088.00 - 6094.00] P:1554.20 E:0.077752 |  You know, it's cost them fortune to get over here, whether it's by land, sea, rail, whatever.
[6094.00 - 6098.00] P:1595.73 E:0.069691 |  You come to this to remember it for the rest of your life.
[6098.00 - 6102.00] P:1524.13 E:0.074765 |  Not going to, how are you going to look back on this when you've been pepper sprayed by the French police?
[6102.00 - 6106.00] P:1732.83 E:0.089588 |  Tom, thank you so much for joining us and bringing us that story.
[6106.00 - 6108.00] P:1505.73 E:0.087309 |  That's Tom King, Northwest Football reporter for The Mail.
[6108.00 - 6110.00] P:1583.72 E:0.076132 |  We're here inside the Stade de France.
[6110.00 - 6114.00] P:1830.90 E:0.089765 |  I'm looking at an image of Mo Salah with his eyes closed right now.
[6114.00 - 6118.00] P:1680.69 E:0.084658 |  We were looking forward to a picture perfect night in the city of light,
[6118.00 - 6123.00] P:1690.65 E:0.083893 |  but it just feels that bit darker now after everything we've heard that's happened outside.
[6123.00 - 6126.00] P:1786.38 E:0.092026 |  Looking to our right-hand side, yes, there are many more Liverpool fans.
[6126.00 - 6132.00] P:1772.54 E:0.085173 |  You can still see empty seats, but we do have a Champions League final.
[6132.00 - 6136.00] P:1706.09 E:0.086569 |  And Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton are with correspondent John Murray.
[6136.00 - 6142.00] P:1556.70 E:0.089345 |  Well, the European Cup is being walked out from one plinth to another.
[6142.00 - 6151.00] P:1531.61 E:0.091776 |  Ian Rush is there for Liverpool, representing Liverpool with holding the left handle of the European Cup.
[6151.00 - 6158.00] P:1704.03 E:0.085766 |  And holding the right handle is Raoul, two of the greatest players to represent these two clubs.
[6158.00 - 6164.00] P:1521.39 E:0.082819 |  But while this is happening inside the stadium and we've had the ceremony,
[6164.00 - 6170.00] P:1674.70 E:0.076736 |  everything seems to be relatively normal from the point where we are observing it from.
[6170.00 - 6173.00] P:1853.86 E:0.076872 |  Clearly these difficulties are continuing outside the stadium.
[6173.00 - 6177.00] P:1639.76 E:0.085664 |  And I mean, this is not a new issue. This is not a new problem.
[6177.00 - 6182.00] P:1763.06 E:0.080260 |  Chris Sutton, Alan Shearer, as long as we've been following football,
[6182.00 - 6188.00] P:1700.76 E:0.084409 |  there have been difficulties, a big showpiece, European matches, as far as you want to go back.
[6188.00 - 6197.00] P:1564.59 E:0.095842 |  And I'm afraid they, we, whoever it is who's organising these events, just simply cannot get it right.
[6197.00 - 6202.00] P:1576.81 E:0.111145 |  No, you're absolutely spot on, the fact that there are thousands of Liverpool fans
[6202.00 - 6207.00] P:1635.74 E:0.104532 |  who have tickets who are still outside the stadium, who want to get in, it's unacceptable.
[6207.00 - 6213.00] P:1592.43 E:0.105791 |  This has been a badly organised event. And, you know, from a player's point of view as well, Alan, now,
[6213.00 - 6219.00] P:1580.70 E:0.093036 |  it'll be interesting to see they'll have to switch on, they will have to focus on the difficult,
[6219.00 - 6225.00] P:1530.04 E:0.101222 |  the preparation with them, because we know that preparation with footballers is so, so meticulous.
[6225.00 - 6232.00] P:1441.35 E:0.102016 |  It's just not fair. It's not fair on the fans. It's not fair on the players because of their preparation.
[6232.00 - 6239.00] P:1633.05 E:0.098738 |  Dom said it before, the, the thousands of these fans have spent ridiculous amounts of money trying to get here.
[6239.00 - 6242.00] P:1641.18 E:0.107207 |  It's not an experience that they expected no one to.
[6242.00 - 6247.00] P:1850.17 E:0.106142 |  Now we have got to talk about the football and the players are out here and I'm looking at that Liverpool team
[6247.00 - 6249.00] P:1841.61 E:0.094742 |  and Tiago, it is actually there.
[6249.00 - 6256.00] P:1678.41 E:0.097547 |  Tiago's there. This is the Champions League theme. I think there is some brewing of the theme,
[6256.00 - 6263.00] P:1710.08 E:0.098759 |  if I, if I'm hearing that correctly, which is clearly coming from the Liverpool supporters,
[6263.00 - 6272.00] P:1656.23 E:0.097327 |  knowing that their friends, colleagues, people they know well, are still outside the ground and cannot get in.
[6272.00 - 6278.00] P:1596.12 E:0.106887 |  I mean, it is filling up, definitely. There are now more people in the, in their seats than there were.
[6278.00 - 6293.00] P:1601.74 E:0.091349 |  You know, maybe five, six minutes ago. So let's hope everyone is going to A, stay safe and B, get inside to witness what we hope is going to be a memorable and special experience.
[6293.00 - 6304.00] P:1485.81 E:0.091137 |  And I've just been reminded as well that we saw Kenny Darglish, didn't we, coming behind the goal at our end to our right.
[6304.00 - 6314.00] P:1605.99 E:0.090872 |  Kenny Darglish was actually laying a wreath behind that goal in memory of the 39 fans, mainly Italian, who died in the Heisel disaster,
[6314.00 - 6329.00] P:1682.62 E:0.093683 |  which is 37 years ago yesterday. So problems, big events like this, the European Cup final, this goes back decades.
[6329.00 - 6331.00] P:1617.85 E:0.102893 |  So the teams are out there now.
[6331.00 - 6332.00] P:1516.94 E:0.062073 |  66, Trent.
[6332.00 - 6338.00] P:1577.17 E:0.095919 |  Liverpool in their red shirts, red shorts and red socks are lining up for their team photograph.
[6338.00 - 6344.00] P:1749.20 E:0.089060 |  And they've actually called the substitutes on as well. This is quite unusual for the team photograph before the match.
[6344.00 - 6347.00] P:1771.94 E:0.085942 |  The substitutes and their pink bibs have joined in as well.
[6347.00 - 6351.00] P:1678.03 E:0.099175 |  And it is a team photograph of the whole squad for Liverpool.
[6351.00 - 6359.00] P:1718.61 E:0.103505 |  As Alan Shiro said, Thiago is out there. There was clearly a question of whether he was going to be fit enough to start this match, even in the warm-up.
[6359.00 - 6369.00] P:1599.14 E:0.094340 |  Jordan Henderson walks to the halfway line and he has shaken hands with Karim Benzema, the Real Madrid captain. They are ready for kick-off.
[6369.00 - 6380.00] P:1611.69 E:0.093454 |  So we are about to get underway. It is due to kick-off at 9.36 local time and that is one minute away.
[6380.00 - 6386.00] P:1615.41 E:0.097394 |  So these are the teams for the 2022 UEFA Champions League final.
[6386.00 - 6397.00] P:1623.69 E:0.098554 |  Liverpool with Alisson in goal, Alexander Arnold, Canate, Van Dyke and Robertson, Fabinho, Henderson and Thiago, Salah, Mane and Luis Diaz.
[6397.00 - 6407.00] P:1670.89 E:0.088649 |  And Real Madrid with Thibault Coutrois in goal, Carvajal, Militão, Alaba and Mendi in midfield, Casamiro, Modric and Croce.
[6407.00 - 6413.00] P:1393.98 E:0.079830 |  And then Valverde on the right, Venetius on the left and Karim Benzema through the middle.
[6413.00 - 6422.00] P:1503.66 E:0.089694 |  We have with us tonight Alan Shiro and Chris Sutton. Let's get a word from both of you on what you think might lie ahead this evening on the pitch.
[6422.00 - 6430.00] P:1698.07 E:0.098499 |  Well it is who can adapt to what has happened in the last 35 or 40 minutes for these Liverpool players because they were ready to go at quarter to nine.
[6430.00 - 6438.00] P:1692.42 E:0.096712 |  So they had a message and been delayed. So it is who can react the quickest and get off to that quick start that both teams will desperately want and need.
[6438.00 - 6450.00] P:1611.99 E:0.096602 |  mentality monsters Liverpool and Real Madrid have shown in this competition that they have great resilience as well but who is going to be affected the most from the delay.
[6450.00 - 6460.00] P:1681.80 E:0.092887 |  So we're about to bring you live commentary across BBC Radio on the 67th European Cup final or Champions League final and the match begins.
[6460.00 - 6464.00] P:1592.11 E:0.088472 |  Liverpool kick off playing from right to left in the first half.
[6464.00 - 6473.00] P:1654.46 E:0.089344 |  Real Madrid looking to clear at Nose, a foul on Valverde, just a little show from Thiago and it's a free kick for Real Madrid in their own right back area.
[6473.00 - 6486.00] P:1469.46 E:0.097447 |  And when I say across BBC Radio what a meaning is on five live, on BBC Sounds, on BBC Radio Merseyside and as well on the World Service who join us from all around the world.
[6486.00 - 6496.00] P:1445.59 E:0.093281 |  And for those who have just joined us that have been problems outside the stadium tonight, some supporters have found it very difficult to get inside and obviously we have this delayed kick off.
[6496.00 - 6506.00] P:1493.75 E:0.093897 |  But the match is underway and it's Liverpool coming forward and the ball is played to Manny on the edge of the box but across importantly comes Alabao who himself was an injury doubt for this match, clears it away.
[6506.00 - 6512.00] P:1663.33 E:0.084074 |  The offside flag is up and it is a free kick to Real Madrid in front of their own penalty area.
[6512.00 - 6520.00] P:1534.54 E:0.087754 |  So yes Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton, Champions League goal scorers both are with us here to witness what promises to be a special event.
[6521.00 - 6527.00] P:1604.25 E:0.095882 |  Yeah and absolutely, we've seen the early stages, I think we all expected Liverpool to get after Real Madrid.
[6527.00 - 6536.00] P:1755.14 E:0.094968 |  Valverde just starting on that right hand side leaving Benzemaat as a central striker, Vinicius Junior off the left hand side but a bright start from Liverpool.
[6536.00 - 6549.00] P:1681.75 E:0.092590 |  I know already Courtois passing the ball out from the back which certainly will suit Liverpool and did on that occasion because we know that's what Liverpool like, that's what they want opposition teams to do to pass that around and then they press,
[6549.00 - 6553.00] P:1672.31 E:0.098235 |  force them to kick it along and won the ball back and then they've now got a free kick themselves.
[6553.00 - 6562.00] P:1438.59 E:0.096899 |  The referee is a Frenchman, Camus Terpant who was the fourth official actually in the final between these teams four years ago in Kiev.
[6562.00 - 6567.00] P:1412.37 E:0.102022 |  So Liverpool with this free kick on the left hand side, dangerous from set pieces, we know that.
[6567.00 - 6576.00] P:1549.97 E:0.095124 |  Robertson and Alexander-Arnold, this is their first opportunity, one of them to swing it in. Alexander-Arnold right footed, it's a poor delivery from Alexander-Arnold
[6576.00 - 6588.00] P:1617.67 E:0.088423 |  and it's easily headed away by Benzemaat on the edge of the box but it comes back to the Liverpool right back who hits it high into the penalty area with his right foot but Benzemaat is easily through for Courtois to take the bouncing ball.
[6588.00 - 6591.00] P:1893.55 E:0.086697 |  That could have been better for the first set piece.
[6591.00 - 6597.00] P:1950.06 E:0.096930 |  Yeah you expect better from Alexander-Arnold, such a good deliverer of a football.
[6597.00 - 6605.00] P:1903.98 E:0.093157 |  He's at the most touches of an outfield player in the Champions League this season but the Eugentop will be expecting better.
[6605.00 - 6616.00] P:1640.20 E:0.094038 |  To you both, Courtois is put under pressure by Jordan Henderson doing the pressing through the middle and Courtois clearance goes long downfield and Van Dyke is able to just roll it back to Allyson.
[6616.00 - 6626.00] P:1594.97 E:0.091730 |  So the nerves will be there I'm sure for an occasion such as this and those nerves may have been sharpened by the long delay.
[6626.00 - 6634.00] P:1647.34 E:0.088752 |  Ball played downfield towards Sadio Mane but across comes the covering challenge, a good one as well from Millie Tau who was able to clear it away.
[6634.00 - 6655.00] P:1638.04 E:0.083565 |  Real Madrid all in white and Real Madrid with Casamiro who works the ball forward into the centre circle to Benzemaat and then Valverde, this exciting Uruguayan plays the ball out towards the far side but it's deflected out of play and it is a throwing to Real Madrid near the half way line that Mende takes quickly.
[6655.00 - 6671.00] P:1609.41 E:0.095068 |  And now a little rather laboured step over from Modric gives the ball out towards the left hand side, Vinicius is there, Liverpool are well stocked when Vinicius receives the ball for the first time and it's deflected out for another throw to Real Madrid over on the far side of the field.
[6671.00 - 6678.00] P:1655.44 E:0.103528 |  He was the difference wasn't he last season, this is junior and they knocked Liverpool out and that's going to be a key battle isn't it?
[6678.00 - 6679.00] P:1635.77 E:0.094836 |  Yes.
[6679.00 - 6693.00] P:1542.50 E:0.095268 |  Vinicius scored two goals in that quarterfinal when Real Madrid won the first leg 3-1 in the Burnabout as the ball is played forward by Liverpool but bounces easily through to Couretois who's able to overarm it out.
[6693.00 - 6698.00] P:1617.84 E:0.081717 |  There is Carlo Ancelotti for the first time we see him on the edge of the coaching area.
[6699.00 - 6711.00] P:1610.01 E:0.088858 |  He's wearing a suit as managers have done over the years in cup finals but not Jürgen Klopp, he's gone for the casual look that he always has in his training gear which says I mean business.
[6711.00 - 6717.00] P:1760.61 E:0.089880 |  But Carlo Ancelotti tonight could become the first coach to win this great competition four times.
[6717.00 - 6724.00] P:1769.67 E:0.087949 |  When it is a player as well twice, long pull forward for Real Madrid and Robertson was able to knock it out of play for a throw.
[6724.00 - 6736.00] P:1742.70 E:0.090650 |  Already they've mixed it up Real Madrid haven't they with passing it around at the back at this time chose to go along to try and knock it over in behind Andy Robertson but he defended really well and put it out for a throw in.
[6736.00 - 6746.00] P:1880.27 E:0.092774 |  Yes and what is fascinating as Chris Sutton has mentioned is that Carlo Ancelotti has demonstrated that he is very capable of winning against Jürgen Klopp's teams.
[6746.00 - 6750.00] P:1797.97 E:0.083936 |  He's got a better record, a winning record against Klopp.
[6750.00 - 6759.00] P:1728.12 E:0.086310 |  Real Madrid coming forward, ball played out towards the right hand side and it's Carvajal, knocks it back, Militao's ball to Vinicius on the edge of the area.
[6759.00 - 6767.00] P:1772.63 E:0.083902 |  Alexander-Arnold is tight on him, still Vinicius goes back towards Tony Cross and then he just clips a high ball to Benzema on the left hand side.
[6767.00 - 6775.00] P:1857.22 E:0.091561 |  44 goal, Benzema this season, he's created Habak Benzema in the knockout stages on this great run from Real Madrid.
[6775.00 - 6783.00] P:1802.84 E:0.093008 |  Madrid now played for to the edge of the penalty area but it bounces away and Robertson's able to win a throw in as he cleared it back downfield.
[6783.00 - 6789.00] P:1745.30 E:0.094946 |  Yes, interesting isn't it because I think Liverpool like this when teams actually do come onto them.
[6789.00 - 6796.00] P:1601.02 E:0.093166 |  That's when they're at their most dangerous breaking out to have that pace up front and they de-azzle running behind Salah.
[6797.00 - 6798.00] P:1696.69 E:0.104186 |  KG start.
[6798.00 - 6804.00] P:1604.90 E:0.095640 |  So we had a 36 minute delay to kick off here in the Stade de France where the floodlights are on.
[6804.00 - 6808.00] P:1446.70 E:0.090371 |  It's not a warm evening by any means.
[6808.00 - 6822.00] P:1519.19 E:0.087995 |  There is a breeze that has a little bit of chill in it as Liverpool come forward over the halfway line but dry night as the lights take greater effect on this arena where Liverpool have possession with Thiago.
[6822.00 - 6825.00] P:1633.30 E:0.078938 |  Need to keep an eye on him just to see how fit he is.
[6825.00 - 6828.00] P:1568.38 E:0.087152 |  It's clearly a gamble that he's played in this match.
[6828.00 - 6834.00] P:1923.55 E:0.093335 |  Remember Thiago actually missed the Carabao Cup final this season when he was injured in the warm-up.
[6834.00 - 6838.00] P:2027.82 E:0.093599 |  Here's Van Gaik on the halfway line to Robertson.
[6838.00 - 6846.00] P:1926.11 E:0.100224 |  Robertson five or six yards inside Madrid territory up to Mane who shields the ball from Casamiro.
[6846.00 - 6850.00] P:1796.90 E:0.098765 |  One with a free kick, it's not given. Real Madrid break away, Benzema.
[6850.00 - 6854.00] P:1769.57 E:0.095225 |  Now to the right-hand side to Valverde who gets a fortunate break in the ball.
[6854.00 - 6857.00] P:1866.27 E:0.079351 |  It bounced back to him off Thiago.
[6857.00 - 6862.00] P:1755.41 E:0.090122 |  Valverde with a cross to the edge of the penalty area pulling it back from near the corner flag but Fabinho is there.
[6862.00 - 6869.00] P:1799.98 E:0.092928 |  I don't know what Alan thinks though. I thought that was a clear foul on Mane from Casamiro who's lucky to stay on the field against Manchester City.
[6869.00 - 6873.00] P:1809.45 E:0.094860 |  Liverpool breaking away over the halfway line with Alexander-Arnold.
[6873.00 - 6878.00] P:1819.79 E:0.079011 |  Gives the ball to the right-hand side and Liverpool with Salah work it back.
[6878.00 - 6883.00] P:1675.27 E:0.077410 |  Alexander-Arnold tried to give it back to Salah but Mende stepped forward and intercepted that pass.
[6883.00 - 6891.00] P:1779.89 E:0.089662 |  Real Madrid have it again halfway inside their own half with Modric and then the two central defenders.
[6891.00 - 6896.00] P:1758.60 E:0.095879 |  Alaba and Militão. Alaba himself put out for this game as the ball is cleared downfield.
[6896.00 - 6900.00] P:1771.87 E:0.100090 |  Alisson's come out of his penalty area and was able to head it away.
[6900.00 - 6908.00] P:1677.49 E:0.095958 |  And then Alexander-Arnold is strong against Benzema and Liverpool continue to have possession in the central third of the field.
[6908.00 - 6912.00] P:1705.46 E:0.101890 |  Here is Fabinho another of the Liverpool injury worries.
[6912.00 - 6917.00] P:1631.53 E:0.103876 |  I think there's a greater confidence that he was going to be okay when Jürgen Klopp spoke to us yesterday.
[6917.00 - 6929.00] P:1583.41 E:0.096617 |  So Liverpool nail Real Madrid nail in the Champions League final here in Sandonee nine miles, nine kilometres north of the centre of the French capital.
[6929.00 - 6936.00] P:1776.32 E:0.099206 |  Here is Mane playing the ball forward through the inside left position but Luz Diaz was on his heels and the ball just runs through for a goal kick.
[6936.00 - 6947.00] P:1623.27 E:0.097384 |  Interestingly, you know, I said about the long ball over Robertson's side, well just 30 or 40 seconds ago they did the opposite and went for a long ball over the right side when Trent was pushing forward.
[6947.00 - 6951.00] P:1686.16 E:0.107298 |  We mentioned that little batterlac that we thought is going to be so important.
[6951.00 - 6958.00] P:1554.69 E:0.096100 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold against Vinicius Jr. That might just be a taste of what is about to come.
[6958.00 - 6966.00] P:1589.95 E:0.098179 |  Real Madrid take the goal kick Valverde turns it in field but straight to Liverpool and to Fabinho and then Van Dijk goes back to Alisson.
[6966.00 - 6970.00] P:1520.27 E:0.092581 |  What about the choice today of Canate rather than Matip alongside Van Dijk?
[6970.00 - 6978.00] P:1634.41 E:0.098579 |  I've got to say as usual I got it run up and saying all week at the Matip but Canate gets a chance and is at home city.
[6979.00 - 6988.00] P:1604.96 E:0.098182 |  Here is Salah on the right-hand side. Salah, boxed the ball forward to Henderson who's there and he went to throw in off Vinicius after inside the Liverpool half.
[6988.00 - 6997.00] P:1616.40 E:0.100106 |  I don't think that was an easy call Alan, four-clop. Canate's been the go-to man in the Champions League but Matip's had a good Premier League season.
[6997.00 - 7007.00] P:1788.06 E:0.102640 |  No, I think he's, no surprise to me that he's actually put him in there. He's certainly been reliable, quick, can recover with that Liverpool high line as well.
[7007.00 - 7015.00] P:1581.52 E:0.097269 |  Yes, Henderson on the right-hand side plays it up to Salah who goes back to the half-way line. He started seven of the last nine now, Canate.
[7015.00 - 7020.00] P:1643.63 E:0.099872 |  Ball played through into the penalty area for Mane who turns it back. The ball might have been over the dead ball line it was.
[7020.00 - 7029.00] P:1708.13 E:0.088398 |  He clags up, he comes back to Salah who hits the shot high over the crossbar but the flag was up from the assistant on the far side and it's a goal kick to Real Madrid.
[7029.00 - 7042.00] P:1520.25 E:0.097372 |  That is, he started the recent games in the Champions League in the last couple of rounds, Canate, started the FA Cup final and here he is now starting the Champions League final and he's never lost in the Liverpool shirt, Canate.
[7042.00 - 7058.00] P:1563.40 E:0.092324 |  That's why he's in then. In his 28 appearances so far. So it's a goal kick, great noise now ringing round the stadium and it does look, doesn't it, the two of you that we are much closer now to a capacity crowd inside the stadium.
[7058.00 - 7062.00] P:1532.95 E:0.100470 |  Thankfully there's hardly any empty seats now in that Liverpool end.
[7062.00 - 7085.00] P:1635.58 E:0.085555 |  We'll have more at half-time obviously on what's been happening outside the Stade de France this evening but for many people here this evening this will have been a really upsetting, distressing and fractious experience and that's horrible really for an event like this which is really meant to be relished and enjoyed that people come here and have bad experiences.
[7085.00 - 7096.00] P:1578.14 E:0.092136 |  Chris you're going to be with Robbie Savage aren't you for the 6-0-6 phone-in on 5-live later and I'm sure you'll have people giving you eye-witness accounts of what was happening from those Liverpool supporters.
[7096.00 - 7111.00] P:1581.87 E:0.090097 |  So that will be after the match is over and the trophy has been presented one way or the other. Here's Benzemaier inside the Real Madrid half, over the half-way line but in comes Alexander Arnold and just says we'll put a stop to that straight away.
[7112.00 - 7113.00] P:1467.55 E:0.060645 |  Ball out with play for a throw.
[7113.00 - 7126.00] P:1666.90 E:0.090518 |  That combination, Benzemaier and Vinicius Jr. 100 goals between them, goals and assists this season they have linked up so well and Benzemaier will drop deep and Vinicius Jr. he'll make those runs in behind.
[7126.00 - 7132.00] P:1786.29 E:0.090796 |  Liverpool's highline a lot made of it this season, can this Real Madrid team expose it?
[7133.00 - 7148.00] P:1678.55 E:0.088444 |  63 goals between them with Benzemaier obviously with his 44 having the Lions share as it comes back to Henderson in the centre circle, high ball over the top, Carver Haldes underneath that, heads up and it bounces out of play.
[7148.00 - 7162.00] P:1667.82 E:0.092361 |  It's a real testament to what he's done since he's become a Liverpool player. I think every single one of us was expecting Dias to be in the starting line-up and he is on the ball now.
[7162.00 - 7174.00] P:1659.85 E:0.096887 |  The number 23 down the left hand side, nice work. Little ball in field towards Manny who tried to give it back to him but Real Madrid doubling up there with Casamiro and Carver Haldes behind for Liverpool.
[7174.00 - 7186.00] P:1650.85 E:0.099261 |  I think Carver Haldes had a particularly poor season around Madrid and the right of ideas. How many players have come to the Premier League and hit the ground running like he has?
[7186.00 - 7199.00] P:1578.29 E:0.090114 |  Yes, so we've got Firmino and Jota both among the substitutes for Liverpool tonight. Real Madrid take the short goal kick this time to the half-way line eventually but then Favino wins it back and Liverpool come again.
[7199.00 - 7215.00] P:1662.37 E:0.085623 |  Still 0-0, still in the early stages of this Champions League final, just 12 minutes on the clock after the delayed kickoff. Henderson over on the far side plays it back towards Favino and Liverpool go back inside their own half to Canate and Van Dyke.
[7215.00 - 7226.00] P:1733.68 E:0.096717 |  It is noticeable you know when Liverpool are attacking and Trent is pushing forward on that right hand side, Canate is just going over and picking Vinicius Junior up just in case and it's happened once or twice already.
[7227.00 - 7244.00] P:1751.14 E:0.094122 |  Liverpool try to come through the middle with Manet but it's too crowded in there, too many of those famous white shirts of Real Madrid. Alexander-Arnold goes cross-field and then Dias is able to take it down on the outside of his right boot into the penalty area now, skipping away from a second challenge that comes in on him.
[7244.00 - 7259.00] P:1780.41 E:0.086733 |  Still in possession, uses Thiago who goes for one of those, look one way, pass it to the other and then the cross from Robertson which is deflected right across the penalty area and Mendy has to chest it back to Courtois and that is the first little scare.
[7260.00 - 7274.00] P:1717.98 E:0.089263 |  Courtois just wasn't sure there, stayed on his line as the ball took a deflection off the Robertson cross and we can see why Valverde has been picked and that Real Madrid right hand side doubling up straight away when Dias got the ball.
[7274.00 - 7276.00] P:1514.50 E:0.079476 |  Want to help Carvalho out?
[7305.00 - 7319.00] P:1752.04 E:0.092757 |  That exact thing happened that I mentioned Trent went forward, Real Madrid win the ball back, they break on that down there left hand side and Canati was big strong. He was no way was Vinicius getting past him there, it was great defending.
[7319.00 - 7321.00] P:1550.95 E:0.063146 |  That was a marker.
[7322.00 - 7326.00] P:1747.84 E:0.082169 |  It was little and large wasn't it? Just took the ball off him.
[7326.00 - 7343.00] P:1681.33 E:0.087025 |  Niel Niel, Liverpool with it on the halfway line. Here is Van Dijk again, Liverpool going third. Well they can't get the quadruple but they could get an unprecedented treble.
[7343.00 - 7354.00] P:1477.92 E:0.087555 |  And here is Henderson on the right hand side, the Liverpool captain who's lifted six different trophies in this run of success that Liverpool have had under Jurgen Klopp.
[7354.00 - 7359.00] P:1648.36 E:0.090307 |  Back to the halfway line and Alexander-Arnold just lifts it straight back to his goalkeeper, Alisson.
[7359.00 - 7363.00] P:1626.07 E:0.093643 |  Another of the important players, part of the Liverpool spine.
[7364.00 - 7371.00] P:1622.75 E:0.101775 |  Worries about Van Dijk, worries about Fabinho, worries about Salah, worries about Thiago but they're all playing.
[7371.00 - 7380.00] P:1574.50 E:0.087584 |  And here is Robertson on the left hand side, back towards Thiago. Right footed ball, sprayed downfield out to the figure of Henderson.
[7380.00 - 7387.00] P:1622.62 E:0.106297 |  Now back to Alexander-Arnold who's into the penalty area, plays it at first takes an affection and a save down to his left from Salah.
[7388.00 - 7395.00] P:1687.82 E:0.101634 |  An excellent change of direction from Mareal Madrid goalkeeper Gourgeois to get down and was able to push it away.
[7395.00 - 7405.00] P:1728.08 E:0.097227 |  First chance on goal, Salah it was saved, back into the box from Liverpool. Here is Salah again, little ball deflected to Lewis Diaz who shoots and it is deflected also.
[7405.00 - 7416.00] P:1798.96 E:0.104155 |  Back to Robertson on the left hand side, Robertson then works it infield. Thiago now with a chance but curls it easily enough for Gourgeois to take two or three little steps to his left and pat it down.
[7416.00 - 7425.00] P:1750.57 E:0.100331 |  It's the first save from Courtois wasn't it? It was a long diagonal ball from Thiago to Henderson who just cushion headed the ball back to Alexander-Arnold.
[7425.00 - 7433.00] P:1666.04 E:0.086782 |  He fired across and it's just behind Mo Salah, Alan and he hooks it, goal was right footed and it's a good save from Courtois.
[7433.00 - 7440.00] P:1698.15 E:0.086020 |  Great play from Alexander-Arnold down the right hand side, just pulled it back that little bit too much which meant it was behind Salah.
[7440.00 - 7446.00] P:1738.25 E:0.091961 |  He couldn't get the connection that he wanted but still got his shot away and it was an impressive save from Courtois.
[7446.00 - 7453.00] P:1682.10 E:0.089469 |  I'm quite enjoying Thiago's body language which I mean he is the uber confident player isn't he?
[7453.00 - 7461.00] P:1655.42 E:0.089194 |  But the way that he's carrying himself as he gives the ball to Thiago down the left hand side to Lewis Diaz who then flicks it back to Thiago.
[7461.00 - 7474.00] P:1814.59 E:0.096037 |  Socks rolled down his calves and now Robertson and then Henderson centrally Robertson again, low ball into the penalty area and Maneu who plays it across and a calling shot from Salah which is just above the head of Courtois.
[7474.00 - 7478.00] P:1748.67 E:0.098917 |  And again the big belting is able to put up his hands and pat the ball down.
[7478.00 - 7490.00] P:1796.85 E:0.090176 |  Such a wonderful take from Maneuil, the ball slipped and the left hand side of Ruma Dridbox, Maneuil takes it and it just bubbles for Salah, comes at him quickly, 12 yards out.
[7490.00 - 7492.00] P:1937.06 E:0.098016 |  He's got straight at Courtois.
[7492.00 - 7499.00] P:1918.81 E:0.098086 |  It's really clever play from Maneuil, he's out there at Militawo, Alaba, didn't know whether to go in tight with him.
[7499.00 - 7506.00] P:1693.40 E:0.095264 |  They both chose not to and stand off him very dangerous when you give someone of his ability that much time to take a touch and turn.
[7506.00 - 7516.00] P:1702.28 E:0.096890 |  It feels to me like Liverpool are just in their stride but mind you we know the dangers of Real Madrid and here's Valverde on the right hand side who plays the ball across
[7516.00 - 7520.00] P:1663.86 E:0.091202 |  and Randa Arnold on the cover coming across and just calmly chips it away.
[7520.00 - 7523.00] P:1633.90 E:0.086468 |  I thought you spoke a little bit too soon there John for a second.
[7523.00 - 7526.00] P:1617.22 E:0.077945 |  Yes I'd already started the sentence though Chris.
[7526.00 - 7532.00] P:1682.37 E:0.087016 |  But going back to Thiago, his body language to me is almost as if to say look I'll show you, I'm absolutely fine.
[7532.00 - 7537.00] P:1844.24 E:0.095677 |  Well considering we almost ruled him out ourselves didn't we because he didn't look too comfortably in the warm up.
[7537.00 - 7539.00] P:1369.28 E:0.068885 |  He's seen a lot of the ball.
[7539.00 - 7542.00] P:1667.82 E:0.076321 |  Yeah that's good that we're not medical experts.
[7543.00 - 7553.00] P:1585.45 E:0.093383 |  Fabinho just forwarded the centre circle and then Thiago clips it under the chest of Henderson who plays it over the top to Manet right side of the box but forced away from goal
[7553.00 - 7561.00] P:1609.59 E:0.080488 |  and still in possession, Sariel Manet is able to find Salah, low ball to Alexander Arnold.
[7561.00 - 7568.00] P:1484.42 E:0.089531 |  Now back to the right hand side, Henderson thought about delivering it into the box instead uses Manet who's still out there and into the area at the Salah
[7568.00 - 7576.00] P:1773.01 E:0.095737 |  and Alexander Arnold with a shot but he was leaning back and that sent it spiralling away high over the near top corner.
[7576.00 - 7584.00] P:1720.51 E:0.091052 |  Their creativity and movement down that right hand side at the minute were whether Salah and Marnie linking up or Trent Alexander Arnold and Salah linking up.
[7584.00 - 7588.00] P:1704.20 E:0.086673 |  It's impressive in this first 15 minutes or so.
[7588.00 - 7590.00] P:1597.90 E:0.097030 |  Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 0.
[7590.00 - 7592.00] P:1655.39 E:0.100857 |  He plays a little bit inverted doesn't he?
[7592.00 - 7597.00] P:1694.70 E:0.086831 |  Alexander Arnold is not always out wide on the touch line, took up a good position.
[7597.00 - 7602.00] P:1685.99 E:0.082252 |  Can you expect better from him there as the ball was fed by Salah right hand side of the box?
[7602.00 - 7609.00] P:1501.69 E:0.084665 |  There's still goal, there's almost 20 minutes played in this European Cup final, Champions League final.
[7609.00 - 7619.00] P:1492.98 E:0.083682 |  It's the sixth time that English and Spanish teams have played each other and it is the third time that we've had a Liverpool, Real Madrid final.
[7619.00 - 7627.00] P:1383.03 E:0.088727 |  Liverpool famously, the winners back in 1981 on the other side of Paris, the part de France.
[7627.00 - 7632.00] P:1414.08 E:0.108849 |  And as we know, Real Madrid, the winners in here four years ago.
[7632.00 - 7634.00] P:1771.74 E:0.097822 |  Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 0.
[7634.00 - 7637.00] P:1851.99 E:0.103298 |  Liverpool are the free kick on the half way line.
[7637.00 - 7643.00] P:1683.66 E:0.101045 |  Liverpool have won all of their matches away from Anfield in this competition this season.
[7643.00 - 7647.00] P:1590.87 E:0.089344 |  Here's Fabinho, looking the ball back to his left to Thiago.
[7647.00 - 7652.00] P:1421.65 E:0.086583 |  And then further to the left here, to Robertson back to Thiago again.
[7652.00 - 7658.00] P:1838.78 E:0.103779 |  Little ball low, Sadio Mane, lovely footwork on to his right, third shoot, saved under the post.
[7658.00 - 7664.00] P:1732.74 E:0.097512 |  What a save from Courtois and he deserved that little slice of look that it bounced back to his hands.
[7664.00 - 7666.00] P:1792.15 E:0.095428 |  And he's going to have to have a big night, Courtois.
[7666.00 - 7669.00] P:1760.19 E:0.100446 |  I think it's been Real Madrid's best player this season.
[7669.00 - 7672.00] P:1802.92 E:0.089149 |  Crucial save, Mane, great turn.
[7673.00 - 7678.00] P:1839.34 E:0.102333 |  Shift's the ball, fires in the right foot of the shot and Corklock fingertips Alan.
[7678.00 - 7681.00] P:1726.25 E:0.099114 |  Already in the first 20 minutes he's being Real Madrid's best player
[7681.00 - 7685.00] P:1698.42 E:0.098471 |  because he had to pull two fantastic saves off, including that one there.
[7685.00 - 7689.00] P:1620.97 E:0.091659 |  Well, I remember his saves in the second leg against Manchester City
[7689.00 - 7694.00] P:1692.26 E:0.094240 |  when City had the two goal lead for the fourth time in the tie.
[7694.00 - 7696.00] P:1495.80 E:0.097642 |  That little toe end that was so important.
[7696.00 - 7701.00] P:1733.16 E:0.098935 |  Here come Liverpool again though, they're creating the chances, but Courtois making the saves.
[7701.00 - 7706.00] P:1767.03 E:0.096200 |  And now there's a foul by Thiago in the middle of the Real Madrid half on Casamiro.
[7706.00 - 7709.00] P:1696.95 E:0.076115 |  Lefts, leaves him flat on his face and it's a free kick to Real Madrid.
[7709.00 - 7713.00] P:1563.16 E:0.088824 |  But that has been a really promising 10-minute period I saw.
[7713.00 - 7716.00] P:1772.66 E:0.104079 |  Well, it's Mane that's causing the problem again.
[7716.00 - 7720.00] P:1751.26 E:0.093935 |  I mentioned it a minute or two ago where the defenders don't know whether to get tight on him
[7720.00 - 7724.00] P:1700.75 E:0.091519 |  or let him drop and such as was his quick feet in the box there.
[7724.00 - 7728.00] P:1721.30 E:0.097751 |  He was able to get it to his feet, take that touch and turn and get his shot away.
[7728.00 - 7731.00] P:1585.61 E:0.096144 |  But what a magnificent save from Courtois.
[7731.00 - 7734.00] P:1715.50 E:0.094408 |  Down to his right hand side and was able to push it onto the post.
[7734.00 - 7739.00] P:1540.81 E:0.090815 |  I think the stadium here, the Stade de France around us is pretty much full now.
[7739.00 - 7744.00] P:1774.22 E:0.096448 |  I think those who've had difficulties have been able to get in, which is really good news.
[7744.00 - 7748.00] P:1938.45 E:0.098261 |  But if there are still people outside and if you weren't listening earlier,
[7748.00 - 7751.00] P:1921.85 E:0.086860 |  you know, the police have been using tepah spray,
[7751.00 - 7754.00] P:1665.80 E:0.091801 |  those are the reports that we've had from outside the ground
[7754.00 - 7758.00] P:1663.55 E:0.071548 |  to try and get everything under control.
[7758.00 - 7763.00] P:1726.01 E:0.085819 |  And it's been very upsetting for some people, families out there.
[7763.00 - 7765.00] P:1825.52 E:0.111944 |  But let's hope they're in and enjoying this now.
[7765.00 - 7768.00] P:1806.04 E:0.096214 |  Robertson playing it for Luis Díaz to the edge of the area,
[7768.00 - 7772.00] P:1743.39 E:0.081473 |  but Real Madrid are able to block his progress on the edge of the box.
[7772.00 - 7777.00] P:1720.46 E:0.090329 |  Casamiro with the final challenge and now Real Madrid with Cross playing it away.
[7777.00 - 7780.00] P:1755.30 E:0.100940 |  It's Sadio Mane sliding on a challenge on Tony Cross.
[7780.00 - 7782.00] P:1751.76 E:0.088106 |  I don't think he was expecting that.
[7782.00 - 7784.00] P:1768.96 E:0.087024 |  And the ball goes back with Real Madrid.
[7784.00 - 7787.00] P:1758.09 E:0.098266 |  It's interesting, every time Liverpool get the ball Real Madrid,
[7787.00 - 7792.00] P:1775.61 E:0.074698 |  their back forward drops, they are petrified of Liverpool's pace.
[7792.00 - 7795.00] P:1620.16 E:0.087248 |  Liverpool's forwards getting in behind.
[7795.00 - 7799.00] P:1695.93 E:0.081475 |  Liverpool starting to really control this game
[7799.00 - 7802.00] P:1606.21 E:0.073140 |  and play through the Real Madrid midfield.
[7802.00 - 7805.00] P:1688.10 E:0.093341 |  I know there weren't great chances, John, but how many times did we say
[7805.00 - 7809.00] P:1655.49 E:0.092348 |  for Man City they should have taken, they wished they had taken that chance.
[7809.00 - 7815.00] P:1693.08 E:0.085738 |  Not being great chances, but two decent chances for the standard of this Liverpool team.
[7815.00 - 7817.00] P:1532.83 E:0.108362 |  Got a take then when they come along.
[7817.00 - 7822.00] P:1758.29 E:0.089299 |  It's for Sadio Mane that free shot, a goal, 12 or 13 yards out.
[7822.00 - 7825.00] P:1531.38 E:0.095145 |  How many times do we say that?
[7825.00 - 7829.00] P:1728.19 E:0.094613 |  And it comes back to bite the team that doesn't take the chances.
[7829.00 - 7834.00] P:1812.90 E:0.093513 |  Well, this Real Madrid team have done that so many times this season in this Champions League.
[7834.00 - 7839.00] P:1669.76 E:0.093082 |  They have brilliant stirring run in the knockout stages to get past PSG,
[7839.00 - 7844.00] P:1678.41 E:0.094460 |  to get past Chelsea, to get past Manchester City in the semifinals.
[7844.00 - 7847.00] P:1773.55 E:0.098592 |  So Real Madrid are going for a treble of their own, aren't they?
[7847.00 - 7852.00] P:1691.59 E:0.086082 |  Knocking out three English clubs in the quarterfinal, the semifinal,
[7852.00 - 7856.00] P:1736.48 E:0.095666 |  and then in the final to win the trophy for what would be a record 14th time.
[7856.00 - 7860.00] P:1830.08 E:0.091979 |  Here's Liverpool, the six times winners.
[7860.00 - 7864.00] P:1821.69 E:0.089791 |  Fabinho goes back to van Gaik on the edge of the area,
[7864.00 - 7868.00] P:1685.98 E:0.090543 |  and then forwards to his left to Robertson.
[7868.00 - 7872.00] P:1659.24 E:0.090190 |  Now Thiago again, a low pass through the middle to the feet of Salah,
[7872.00 - 7877.00] P:1660.25 E:0.091336 |  who tried to just roll it through with pace for Mane, that was cut out and intercepted.
[7877.00 - 7880.00] P:1657.77 E:0.089674 |  Thiago on the stretch, but Casamiro is able to take possession of the ball,
[7880.00 - 7886.00] P:1771.68 E:0.093309 |  and it is Real Madrid with Tony Kroes, one of the veterans in this Real Madrid side.
[7886.00 - 7890.00] P:1863.54 E:0.092358 |  They're a bit of a mix, aren't they? Over 30s, some well over 30,
[7890.00 - 7894.00] P:1834.12 E:0.079468 |  but also some really, really promising youngsters.
[7894.00 - 7897.00] P:1808.89 E:0.086819 |  Here's Mendi on the left-hand side, Ferland Mendi.
[7897.00 - 7899.00] P:1803.49 E:0.095447 |  He's one who's in the middle, 26 years old,
[7899.00 - 7902.00] P:1739.38 E:0.092258 |  ball out to the right-hand side to Carvajal.
[7902.00 - 7906.00] P:1734.65 E:0.083636 |  Carvajal then works it back, and of course, at all over this Real Madrid side,
[7906.00 - 7909.00] P:1738.24 E:0.080587 |  are multiple Champions League winners.
[7909.00 - 7915.00] P:1843.95 E:0.091701 |  Here's one, Modric in possession, who's hoping to win it for the fifth time here tonight.
[7915.00 - 7918.00] P:1927.24 E:0.098627 |  And he's not the only one. Kroes on his right foot,
[7918.00 - 7922.00] P:1935.66 E:0.100317 |  thought about the long pass downfield, but goes out to the left-hand side.
[7922.00 - 7926.00] P:1875.51 E:0.091008 |  Venetius is there. He gets the ball down, he's hugging the touchline on the far side.
[7926.00 - 7930.00] P:1806.56 E:0.086254 |  Henderson came across to him, Mendi is there as well.
[7930.00 - 7934.00] P:1739.59 E:0.097846 |  The two left-sided players together, and then Venetius swings it in,
[7934.00 - 7940.00] P:1833.96 E:0.087308 |  and Alisson stretches and catches that at the absolute maximum point.
[7941.00 - 7944.00] P:1599.21 E:0.084315 |  A good stretch from Alisson.
[7944.00 - 7947.00] P:1625.05 E:0.092245 |  Look for a moment like it was going over his head.
[7947.00 - 7951.00] P:1668.56 E:0.074331 |  Fascinating watching Benzema and his movement.
[7951.00 - 7954.00] P:1656.48 E:0.082980 |  Just trying to get out of Van Dyke's eye line,
[7954.00 - 7959.00] P:1631.23 E:0.071991 |  and that quickness of movement at the cross, not on his head.
[7959.00 - 7961.00] P:1594.88 E:0.096622 |  Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 0.
[7961.00 - 7963.00] P:1626.91 E:0.082879 |  You're listening to the Champions League final,
[7963.00 - 7968.00] P:1394.23 E:0.099607 |  with us on five live, big as he sounds, Radio Merseyside, and the World Service.
[7968.00 - 7972.00] P:1394.79 E:0.097911 |  Here's Fabinho forward towards Sadio Mane.
[7972.00 - 7975.00] P:1480.66 E:0.103796 |  Sadio Mane now to Luis Díaz into the area on the left-hand side,
[7975.00 - 7981.00] P:1750.64 E:0.101260 |  still going to Luis Díaz, but forced away, forced back out towards the right-hand side by Carvajal,
[7981.00 - 7985.00] P:1808.02 E:0.096534 |  who ends up going to ground, and winning the free kick.
[7985.00 - 7988.00] P:1735.22 E:0.094187 |  It's defending that, it's from Carvajal. 1v1.
[7988.00 - 7992.00] P:1856.78 E:0.089229 |  Díaz, we know how tricky he is. 1v1 wants to go past people,
[7992.00 - 7997.00] P:1553.95 E:0.070198 |  but Carvajal stood up well to him there.
[7997.00 - 8000.00] P:1603.54 E:0.104074 |  So it is Real Madrid's ball, which actually is a throwing.
[8000.00 - 8002.00] P:1601.39 E:0.084511 |  It's a throwing to Real Madrid, not a free kick.
[8002.00 - 8006.00] P:1752.85 E:0.108009 |  Calverdi gets it back to Carvajal, that's a close, very nearly played.
[8006.00 - 8008.00] P:1715.23 E:0.098116 |  It's straight to Henderson, in fact, it's Alexander-Arnold,
[8008.00 - 8011.00] P:1632.99 E:0.088861 |  who's got it to Salah in the D on the edge of the box, surrounded by White,
[8011.00 - 8015.00] P:1626.50 E:0.080993 |  and then Henderson into the area, but easily cleared away by Mendy.
[8015.00 - 8018.00] P:1787.80 E:0.098572 |  Liverpool dominating the possession now in this first half.
[8018.00 - 8021.00] P:1819.04 E:0.085643 |  It is still the first half, if you've just joined us.
[8021.00 - 8026.00] P:1725.76 E:0.081411 |  26 minutes played because of a delayed kickoff of 36 minutes in the end.
[8026.00 - 8032.00] P:1762.14 E:0.091814 |  Because of difficulties outside the ground, of getting supporters in.
[8032.00 - 8036.00] P:1816.86 E:0.086192 |  A whole range of difficulties outside the stadium this evening,
[8036.00 - 8039.00] P:1689.43 E:0.105147 |  but I'm sure if you haven't heard about, you will,
[8039.00 - 8041.00] P:1673.35 E:0.101410 |  and we'll have more on that at half-time.
[8041.00 - 8045.00] P:1684.66 E:0.095603 |  The Real Madrid with Modric inside his own half,
[8045.00 - 8048.00] P:1534.34 E:0.099323 |  goes for a high, long pass to Carvajal down the right.
[8048.00 - 8052.00] P:1612.86 E:0.097069 |  It's cut out by Robertson, the ball still bouncing for the Real Madrid right back,
[8052.00 - 8054.00] P:1663.89 E:0.086749 |  though he's got the ball caught up underneath his feet,
[8054.00 - 8056.00] P:1773.08 E:0.095472 |  and then is able to play it back.
[8056.00 - 8059.00] P:1777.08 E:0.097769 |  That's a big cheer from all of the Real Madrid fans for his part in that.
[8059.00 - 8061.00] P:1612.87 E:0.083518 |  Carvajal, remember he was injured early on,
[8061.00 - 8068.00] P:1747.24 E:0.092761 |  went off in Ties in the first half of that Champions League final against Liverpool four years ago.
[8068.00 - 8075.00] P:1684.18 E:0.087342 |  It was roundabout now, wasn't it, that Mo Salah tangled with Sergio Ramos as well,
[8075.00 - 8077.00] P:1709.00 E:0.097216 |  and he had to go off in that final.
[8077.00 - 8080.00] P:1737.19 E:0.099471 |  That's why he's after revenge, he's made that very clear.
[8080.00 - 8084.00] P:1745.94 E:0.101276 |  Nil Nil currently, Salah's already had a couple of efforts saved by Courtois.
[8084.00 - 8088.00] P:1622.65 E:0.077701 |  Thiago there in possession in the centre-circle, uses Henderson,
[8088.00 - 8092.00] P:1647.91 E:0.081059 |  and then Fabinho in the centre-circle once again.
[8092.00 - 8097.00] P:1862.34 E:0.102129 |  The three of them there, the three Liverpool midfielders are just a few yards apart from one another.
[8097.00 - 8102.00] P:1945.97 E:0.103805 |  Henderson and Thiago, Fabinho who continues to wander forward,
[8102.00 - 8105.00] P:1891.44 E:0.099641 |  and Real Madrid drop right off Liverpool.
[8105.00 - 8109.00] P:1803.39 E:0.100787 |  It's almost like one of those training exercises that we were watching here,
[8109.00 - 8111.00] P:1734.78 E:0.098236 |  inside the ground last night.
[8112.00 - 8114.00] P:1621.81 E:0.109911 |  It's worked to Lewis Diaz on the left-hand side,
[8114.00 - 8120.00] P:1577.51 E:0.088713 |  Carlo Encelotti just walks forward and points a long arm out there onto the field.
[8120.00 - 8125.00] P:1670.76 E:0.097717 |  Fabinho 30 yards out on his right foot, shoots, but it's wide,
[8125.00 - 8129.00] P:1704.68 E:0.089971 |  and a little bit high as well, wide by five or six yards, Gullke.
[8129.00 - 8132.00] P:1792.98 E:0.095236 |  Well coming up to 28 minutes John, Liverpool have been the better team,
[8132.00 - 8136.00] P:1633.67 E:0.089365 |  certainly more threatening, quicker on the ball, passing it better.
[8136.00 - 8141.00] P:1766.84 E:0.097467 |  Real Madrid have hardly been in and around that Liverpool 18-yard box as yet,
[8141.00 - 8146.00] P:1676.48 E:0.099834 |  so good news for the Liverpool fans, don't look too troubled as yet, Liverpool do they?
[8147.00 - 8152.00] P:1729.83 E:0.098260 |  Two very good saves from Courtois, the first one I think, that was a good save.
[8152.00 - 8156.00] P:1602.04 E:0.093743 |  The second one was a very, very good save onto the post,
[8156.00 - 8159.00] P:1743.19 E:0.099510 |  and now here is Valverde playing it over the top,
[8159.00 - 8163.00] P:1722.28 E:0.091914 |  Liverpool are able to clear Modric and Casimiro, not very happy,
[8163.00 - 8168.00] P:1594.66 E:0.082351 |  Kikla Henderson's challenge centre-field, referee Turpan allows play to continue,
[8168.00 - 8173.00] P:1550.72 E:0.082524 |  and now here's Fabinho again, haven't talked about the pitch at all, have we?
[8173.00 - 8176.00] P:1571.74 E:0.104922 |  Here's Salah on the right-hand side, still going on his left foot to the edge of the box,
[8176.00 - 8182.00] P:1589.68 E:0.079263 |  back to Sadio Manet, and then Henderson again back to Fabinho, closer to the centre-circle.
[8182.00 - 8185.00] P:1586.31 E:0.084779 |  Henderson puts his foot on the ball and goes back again to Fabinho,
[8185.00 - 8188.00] P:1583.15 E:0.096086 |  there's a good confidence around this Liverpool side at the moment.
[8188.00 - 8191.00] P:1661.64 E:0.083966 |  Thiago goes for one of those cross-field passes of his,
[8191.00 - 8197.00] P:1630.68 E:0.090417 |  pinpoint right to the feet of Alexander-Arnold, now Henderson with his swirling right foot cross,
[8197.00 - 8199.00] P:1814.62 E:0.079366 |  but too close to Courtois who's able to catch up.
[8199.00 - 8205.00] P:1750.04 E:0.085732 |  Not a great cross, and the worry for Liverpool is it only takes a moment from Real Madrid,
[8205.00 - 8212.00] P:1736.89 E:0.085683 |  a pass from Modric, who's been more prominent I think in the last five or so minutes for Real Madrid,
[8212.00 - 8215.00] P:1596.80 E:0.081221 |  trying to get a grip of that midfield area.
[8216.00 - 8220.00] P:1360.17 E:0.088194 |  And all of that talk about the pitch last night, seems alright.
[8220.00 - 8223.00] P:1495.25 E:0.092923 |  Jürgen Klopp didn't mind about the pitch.
[8223.00 - 8227.00] P:1434.80 E:0.085221 |  No, so he wasn't happy, but he wasn't mourning about it.
[8227.00 - 8232.00] P:1565.49 E:0.095804 |  But as you said Chris, it's the same for both sides, but it seems okay at the moment.
[8232.00 - 8238.00] P:1761.31 E:0.098423 |  I think Andor Sheen that might be off the hook, he has Modric now cross playing it through the middle,
[8238.00 - 8243.00] P:1762.35 E:0.100375 |  but Alexander-Arnold's able to come across, the ball wouldn't bounce through for Vinicius.
[8243.00 - 8247.00] P:1637.40 E:0.082155 |  I don't think that was anything to do with the pitch, he has Manet, comes back to Manet,
[8247.00 - 8252.00] P:1630.74 E:0.092575 |  Salah was challenged from behind, referee Turban says play on Liverpool, which they do.
[8252.00 - 8258.00] P:1529.63 E:0.093531 |  Alexander-Arnold back to the right hand side, Salah is out there, starts one of those little runs of his into the penalty area,
[8258.00 - 8261.00] P:1694.30 E:0.086470 |  cross comes in with a challenge, just got enough on the ball.
[8261.00 - 8266.00] P:1669.35 E:0.084917 |  Salah just three goals in his last 15 appearances for Liverpool, more Salah.
[8266.00 - 8270.00] P:1776.83 E:0.098369 |  Liverpool supporters will be hoping he's saving them for the big occasion, although he did score,
[8270.00 - 8274.00] P:1762.71 E:0.086588 |  of course when he made his comeback last weekend on the final Sunday as a substitute.
[8274.00 - 8279.00] P:1755.97 E:0.088762 |  He has Valverde again on the right hand side, the number 15, the tall Ure Gwaiyan,
[8279.00 - 8285.00] P:1827.73 E:0.096970 |  one of the youngsters, 23 years old, goes back to Kroos again, centrally 32 years old,
[8285.00 - 8291.00] P:1822.71 E:0.087807 |  and the German World Cup winner on his right foot, there's Mende on the left hand side, Mende,
[8291.00 - 8297.00] P:1580.81 E:0.093990 |  Kroos just trundles across, makes himself available, and Real Madrid for the first time in a little while actually,
[8297.00 - 8300.00] P:1416.51 E:0.107760 |  have got possession inside the Liverpool half.
[8300.00 - 8305.00] P:1542.15 E:0.095546 |  You saw a problem for Liverpool, didn't you Chris, about when Real Madrid won that ball back,
[8305.00 - 8310.00] P:1670.17 E:0.089254 |  that ball directly through the middle, through to Vinicius, trying to hit Liverpool on the break,
[8310.00 - 8316.00] P:1701.53 E:0.087179 |  but it was tremendous defending from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who read it superbly well and managed to stop it.
[8316.00 - 8322.00] P:1693.23 E:0.078704 |  But there's the danger when you have the possession, and it's all mostly Liverpool,
[8322.00 - 8325.00] P:1833.78 E:0.100060 |  you cannot go to sleep with those two up front, Benzema and Vinicius.
[8325.00 - 8330.00] P:1699.27 E:0.097572 |  Do you know, I was just going to say the same thing, but it's like when we played together, you just nipped in ahead of me.
[8332.00 - 8340.00] P:1621.88 E:0.096587 |  I was going to say that, he was Modric, now to the right hand side, and then the ball played in field,
[8340.00 - 8345.00] P:1659.21 E:0.106015 |  and Modric back towards Casamiro, and then Casamiro, Kersley gives it away there, Real Madrid,
[8345.00 - 8351.00] P:1814.71 E:0.094319 |  groans, and Mane straight through to Salah, but it just ran away from him.
[8351.00 - 8355.00] P:1723.25 E:0.103574 |  And so it is, Benzema bringing the ball forward for Real Madrid now, up towards the edge of the area,
[8355.00 - 8361.00] P:1704.28 E:0.100126 |  who pointed to Vinicius where he wanted him to go, and he made a run round the back of Alexander-Arnold into the penalty area,
[8361.00 - 8363.00] P:1659.07 E:0.102635 |  but Benzema wasn't able to find him in Liverpool.
[8363.00 - 8367.00] P:1743.89 E:0.095403 |  No, Van Dyke read that beautifully, his radar was well and truly on.
[8367.00 - 8369.00] P:1718.18 E:0.089137 |  It was all in front of him, wasn't it?
[8369.00 - 8375.00] P:1695.59 E:0.085090 |  It was really good from Van Dyke, but that's the danger, isn't it, those two linking up?
[8376.00 - 8382.00] P:1570.18 E:0.091122 |  Yes, on the subject of your partnership, it's the first time the three of us have all worked together on a match,
[8382.00 - 8390.00] P:1738.47 E:0.091126 |  and I've been looking forward to seeing if your understanding together would be the same with lit microphones in hand,
[8390.00 - 8392.00] P:1563.13 E:0.092460 |  as it was when you had a football at your feet.
[8392.00 - 8395.00] P:1805.02 E:0.088956 |  I just do as I'm told, when Alan gives a glare.
[8395.00 - 8399.00] P:1830.24 E:0.079812 |  As long as he keeps dropping, deep ball running behind, it's fine.
[8399.00 - 8401.00] P:1632.30 E:0.076311 |  Have you reverted to type?
[8402.00 - 8406.00] P:1630.30 E:0.096847 |  You certainly dropped deep in the car, Chris, almost in the boot.
[8406.00 - 8408.00] P:1513.39 E:0.079314 |  It wasn't much joy, sir.
[8408.00 - 8417.00] P:1442.73 E:0.090193 |  No, Liverpool Real Madrid 0, and Milletau clears away downfield, looking for Valverde.
[8417.00 - 8422.00] P:1665.21 E:0.100839 |  Liverpool played infield, Lewis Diaz's manning on the stretch, and he's brought it back.
[8422.00 - 8426.00] P:1773.12 E:0.104978 |  Actually, the referee for the challenge on Lewis Diaz by Luka Modric,
[8426.00 - 8434.00] P:1771.23 E:0.079649 |  so it's a free kick for Liverpool, five or six yards inside the Real Madrid territory.
[8434.00 - 8439.00] P:1551.10 E:0.082670 |  It's actually Carvall, wasn't it, who jumped into the back of Lewis Diaz,
[8439.00 - 8441.00] P:1560.29 E:0.106052 |  so it's a free kick just down here to our left.
[8441.00 - 8445.00] P:1590.66 E:0.094060 |  Liverpool nail Real Madrid, nail 33 minutes played,
[8445.00 - 8452.00] P:1548.29 E:0.094180 |  so Liverpool involved in another Mill-Nail Cup final this season, back to the halfway line.
[8452.00 - 8462.00] P:1571.57 E:0.094775 |  And now Van Dijk in his left foot, but it is 0-0 because of Kibor Koutois with the saves that he's made.
[8462.00 - 8469.00] P:1422.45 E:0.081590 |  Fabinho to the right-hand side, Alexander-Arnaud and Canate, Oxford infield,
[8469.00 - 8474.00] P:1624.19 E:0.094621 |  and then Van Dijk back to Thiago again, and there it is to Canate,
[8474.00 - 8478.00] P:1677.93 E:0.105226 |  yet to make his debut for France, and he's off on a run-down field, long-legged,
[8478.00 - 8483.00] P:1645.46 E:0.092713 |  up to the edge of the penalty area, uses Alexander-Arnaud, left foot of ball into the area,
[8483.00 - 8486.00] P:1820.07 E:0.085982 |  Salah went ahead up and it's straight at Koutois.
[8486.00 - 8490.00] P:1844.73 E:0.096105 |  The Real Madrid goalkeeper seems to be attracting the ball to him.
[8490.00 - 8493.00] P:1848.92 E:0.093264 |  Same thing again, was it, he was just slightly behind Morsale,
[8493.00 - 8496.00] P:1777.13 E:0.087386 |  he just had to take a step to his right and walk away from goal,
[8496.00 - 8499.00] P:1838.14 E:0.083613 |  then adjust his body to try and get out of the header,
[8499.00 - 8504.00] P:1808.76 E:0.086296 |  but that stopped him getting as much direction and power to actually trouble Koutois.
[8504.00 - 8507.00] P:1650.22 E:0.093382 |  Koutois got to be careful here as the ball was played back to him by Millet-Hau,
[8507.00 - 8512.00] P:1681.32 E:0.082870 |  with Manet not far away, but he was able to get it on, was left foot and clear it down.
[8512.00 - 8515.00] P:1696.23 E:0.088642 |  And it remains Liverpool, Nell, Real Madrid, Nell.
[8515.00 - 8521.00] P:1674.39 E:0.081514 |  Five-live, and BBC sounds with Chris Sutton and Alan Shearer with us here in the Stade de France,
[8521.00 - 8529.00] P:1605.95 E:0.082980 |  with darkness falling, and the lights in the City of Light, brightly on.
[8529.00 - 8532.00] P:1661.40 E:0.088051 |  Canate plays it to the right-hand side, Salah, Salah,
[8532.00 - 8535.00] P:1757.96 E:0.100271 |  Salah, Salah, Salah, on the pitch line, but the ball runs away on the plane,
[8535.00 - 8538.00] P:1795.05 E:0.094012 |  it's a joint, the Real Madrid, which Mendy takes quickly,
[8538.00 - 8543.00] P:1662.51 E:0.078219 |  and Real Madrid bring it forward towards Kroos.
[8543.00 - 8545.00] P:1542.31 E:0.094949 |  A wise call to City of Light, John.
[8545.00 - 8549.00] P:1424.59 E:0.090861 |  A two, yes. Anyone who's interested to know and fascinated to know,
[8549.00 - 8553.00] P:1391.85 E:0.089667 |  just listen back to Five-Live Sport last night, and you'll be able to find out.
[8553.00 - 8560.00] P:1520.43 E:0.095241 |  Here's Modric, back to Kroos, and then Kroos clips it here to Carvajal,
[8560.00 - 8565.00] P:1581.92 E:0.101499 |  and then Valverde. Valverde wriggles away from Thiago, still going Valverde,
[8565.00 - 8569.00] P:1567.53 E:0.085632 |  a high crossfield pass to the left-hand side, it bounces.
[8569.00 - 8572.00] P:1671.94 E:0.091485 |  Venetius gets it down, Alexander-Arnolding, quick and sharp,
[8572.00 - 8576.00] P:1620.78 E:0.096034 |  but he was still able to find Benzema, now back to Venetius into the penalty area.
[8576.00 - 8581.00] P:1763.45 E:0.105537 |  And Canate, he was past him, but Henderson was quickly into clear and put it behind for a corner.
[8581.00 - 8587.00] P:1775.84 E:0.103844 |  Lovely little nutmeg, wasn't it, from Venetius Jr. on Canate, and Henderson had to be alert.
[8587.00 - 8590.00] P:1690.66 E:0.093486 |  They've taken a quick corner, Real Madrid, Benzema plays it in,
[8590.00 - 8595.00] P:1768.77 E:0.101209 |  it's rattling around inside the box, and it comes off the head of Venetius and drops to Alisson,
[8595.00 - 8598.00] P:1813.93 E:0.092901 |  and Alisson's launched one downfield for Luis Díaz.
[8598.00 - 8603.00] P:1753.20 E:0.110966 |  Luis Díaz, though, has three Madrid men around him, Carvajal putting in the challenge,
[8603.00 - 8608.00] P:1829.14 E:0.098136 |  and it's a free kick, and Luis Díaz on his knees on the ground is motioning
[8608.00 - 8612.00] P:1764.41 E:0.084061 |  to the referee to suggest that that's not the first time that Carvajal's felled in.
[8612.00 - 8616.00] P:1746.90 E:0.098502 |  Yeah, and he's right, but you know what, the other N-T-Argo got away with one, didn't he?
[8616.00 - 8620.00] P:1767.79 E:0.093083 |  He tried to head the ball back to Alisson, and Venetius Jr. was there.
[8620.00 - 8624.00] P:1767.05 E:0.091409 |  I actually think the ball came off Venetius Jr. off his chest into Alisson's arms,
[8624.00 - 8626.00] P:1728.59 E:0.081490 |  and then the quick break.
[8626.00 - 8628.00] P:1791.60 E:0.074825 |  Really clever from Alisson there.
[8628.00 - 8633.00] P:1689.17 E:0.091268 |  The speed of thought to have a look up and see Díaz and then get the ball away to him.
[8633.00 - 8635.00] P:1575.96 E:0.067210 |  He did really well.
[8635.00 - 8638.00] P:1628.76 E:0.081953 |  Liverpool, nil, Real Madrid, nil.
[8638.00 - 8641.00] P:1594.00 E:0.079192 |  That Madrid corner was the first corner of the match.
[8641.00 - 8644.00] P:1689.09 E:0.085699 |  Here is a free kick for Liverpool.
[8644.00 - 8648.00] P:1535.88 E:0.097657 |  Robertson to take this. It's a little closer to the halfway line than the early one,
[8648.00 - 8650.00] P:1504.47 E:0.086947 |  so it's not delivered into the area.
[8650.00 - 8653.00] P:1592.82 E:0.080682 |  Robertson plays its square to Henderson.
[8653.00 - 8657.00] P:1486.08 E:0.093505 |  Henderson gets right under this pass that Robertson's onto, but it was under pressure from Carvajal.
[8657.00 - 8662.00] P:1639.35 E:0.081207 |  However, it bounces for Liverpool and Fabinho, and then Thiago, and then back to Henderson again.
[8662.00 - 8667.00] P:1774.93 E:0.097503 |  15 yards inside Madrid territory, but he's going to go all the way back into his own half to Alisson,
[8667.00 - 8670.00] P:1860.49 E:0.079539 |  so Liverpool have to drop back.
[8670.00 - 8672.00] P:1840.27 E:0.079252 |  Half-time approaching.
[8672.00 - 8674.00] P:1677.00 E:0.115209 |  Six or seven minutes away.
[8674.00 - 8678.00] P:1730.09 E:0.091193 |  Alisson's ball over the top through the middle for Luis Díaz, but over his head,
[8678.00 - 8683.00] P:1654.31 E:0.081299 |  and Militá putting in the challenge, and Real Madrid have got it back again,
[8683.00 - 8686.00] P:1558.73 E:0.094372 |  moving towards the halfway line.
[8686.00 - 8689.00] P:1433.81 E:0.097501 |  So it's still goal-less here.
[8689.00 - 8692.00] P:1655.02 E:0.089600 |  It's all Liverpool to our right. That's where all of the red is,
[8692.00 - 8695.00] P:1637.83 E:0.091229 |  and it's all white to the left of the halfway line.
[8695.00 - 8698.00] P:1631.70 E:0.094006 |  Got the dignitaries over there, and noticed at one point the television cameras
[8698.00 - 8702.00] P:1571.55 E:0.085567 |  focused in on Forentino Perez, the Real Madrid president,
[8702.00 - 8706.00] P:1588.22 E:0.086778 |  who failed to sign Kylian Mbappe this week.
[8706.00 - 8709.00] P:1658.36 E:0.091045 |  I think the dignitaries all got in on time.
[8709.00 - 8713.00] P:1748.07 E:0.100384 |  Here's Canate, Zibler had the ball away, but Venicius was onto this.
[8713.00 - 8715.00] P:1494.88 E:0.093235 |  Benzema was there, Alexander-Angelo as well.
[8715.00 - 8717.00] P:1603.92 E:0.101425 |  Venicius and Benzema together on the left-hand side.
[8717.00 - 8719.00] P:1629.53 E:0.088690 |  He flicks it back to Benzema.
[8719.00 - 8722.00] P:1663.00 E:0.086856 |  Benzema near the left corner of the penalty area, tried to find a position,
[8722.00 - 8724.00] P:1693.73 E:0.093270 |  but Liverpool quickly closed him down.
[8724.00 - 8728.00] P:1750.08 E:0.090696 |  Now Kroos goes back to Carvajal, and Carvajal hits a ball.
[8728.00 - 8731.00] P:1749.13 E:0.092867 |  The head-height to Valverde that he didn't have much chance with,
[8731.00 - 8735.00] P:1716.19 E:0.107815 |  and it's bounce for Liverpool, and Luis Díaz, lovely, takes it away from Carvajal,
[8735.00 - 8740.00] P:1713.84 E:0.100858 |  and still going, bursting down the left wing, but that's a very good recovery from Carvajal,
[8740.00 - 8744.00] P:1763.53 E:0.104026 |  who's able to get a touch on it, and there's Tieto the Rafters by the Madrid fans
[8744.00 - 8747.00] P:1787.56 E:0.089325 |  for turning it back to goalkeeper Cuo'quo.
[8747.00 - 8749.00] P:1751.80 E:0.090012 |  Again, really good play defending from Carvajal.
[8749.00 - 8755.00] P:1731.57 E:0.095934 |  One V1, he showed great strength to Díaz up against Modric to control the ball.
[8755.00 - 8760.00] P:1789.83 E:0.090886 |  Excuse me, but then he couldn't get away from Carvajal because of his good defending.
[8760.00 - 8762.00] P:1855.00 E:0.084114 |  He stuck with him really well there.
[8763.00 - 8765.00] P:1618.72 E:0.071503 |  Still 0-0.
[8765.00 - 8769.00] P:1762.34 E:0.088689 |  In the first half of this delayed Champions League final,
[8769.00 - 8775.00] P:1718.22 E:0.088353 |  36 minutes delayed it was when it finally got underway.
[8775.00 - 8782.00] P:1609.04 E:0.077922 |  I don't think Camilla Cabello pulled a hamstring despite Chris's fears.
[8782.00 - 8788.00] P:1713.09 E:0.093037 |  Fabinho, she was doing the opening ceremony, yes, he's manning, then back to Fabinho.
[8788.00 - 8790.00] P:1793.43 E:0.098204 |  Hasn't been confirmed, John?
[8790.00 - 8794.00] P:1603.85 E:0.093794 |  No, we're still waiting for the report, we'll have more on that at half-time as well.
[8794.00 - 8798.00] P:1693.34 E:0.094998 |  Here's Fabinho to Henderson, back to Fabinho again, 22 yards out.
[8798.00 - 8802.00] P:1697.69 E:0.081331 |  Henderson looking to his right, Henderson is able to find Salah out there,
[8802.00 - 8808.00] P:1900.48 E:0.085590 |  and then Henderson runs around behind him to make himself available, goes back to Canate instead.
[8808.00 - 8814.00] P:1876.99 E:0.089664 |  Whistles from the Madrid fans, Henderson wins a throw-in of Mindig.
[8814.00 - 8819.00] P:1596.17 E:0.095986 |  So a throw-in to Liverpool halfway inside Madrid territory.
[8819.00 - 8823.00] P:1783.87 E:0.119472 |  He's going to leave it for Alexander-Arnaud to take.
[8823.00 - 8828.00] P:1713.96 E:0.106211 |  Now Manes, go out to Thiago, Thiago to the left-hand side,
[8828.00 - 8833.00] P:1563.89 E:0.100449 |  Robertson takes on Carvajal into the penalty area, low ball into Manet, lovely turn,
[8833.00 - 8840.00] P:1786.01 E:0.090313 |  but it was very tight the angle, he turned the defender, Militão got the shot in,
[8840.00 - 8844.00] P:1692.51 E:0.094251 |  but into the outside of the side net, in viral deflection, so it's a little full corner.
[8844.00 - 8851.00] P:1799.27 E:0.093209 |  He's really positive from Robertson, driving at Carvajal into the box and feeds a clever little ball into Manet,
[8851.00 - 8855.00] P:1734.84 E:0.084688 |  who swivels quickly, good first touch, Militão, great block.
[8855.00 - 8863.00] P:1592.20 E:0.083511 |  Reminding me of the way that Gabriel Jesus was able to turn against the Real Madrid defenders in that first leg at the Etihad.
[8863.00 - 8868.00] P:1720.90 E:0.088460 |  But it's a corner, Liverpool's first corner of the match, Robertson, and it goes to the near post,
[8868.00 - 8872.00] P:1629.41 E:0.092219 |  but headed away from Madrid by Benzema, Henderson with a shot, which flies away wide,
[8872.00 - 8876.00] P:1838.41 E:0.075477 |  through a crowd of players and behind through a goal kick.
[8876.00 - 8882.00] P:1614.16 E:0.078147 |  He struck it well, didn't he? He's never tripled the goalkeeper though, and good 10-12 yards wide.
[8882.00 - 8890.00] P:1655.37 E:0.091471 |  Now he's troubled the photographers behind the goal, behind the hoarding there, so it is still 0-0.
[8890.00 - 8899.00] P:1723.53 E:0.080286 |  Courtois, the saves that he's made, probably the man of the first half for Real Madrid,
[8899.00 - 8905.00] P:1805.97 E:0.085298 |  and Fabinho playing the ball back to the van Dijk.
[8905.00 - 8911.00] P:1558.07 E:0.093477 |  He's made more saves than any other goalkeeper in the Champions League this season, Courtois.
[8912.00 - 8916.00] P:1644.15 E:0.098871 |  Here's Alexander-Arnold playing the ball over the top with Casemiro.
[8916.00 - 8922.00] P:1718.86 E:0.086468 |  Real Madrid have given up a lot of chances in this competition, and you write that.
[8922.00 - 8927.00] P:1649.70 E:0.081494 |  The save from Mane really was something exceptional.
[8927.00 - 8930.00] P:1626.05 E:0.092327 |  That long arm, like Inspector Gadget, wasn't he?
[8930.00 - 8933.00] P:1459.55 E:0.091137 |  Finger tip.
[8933.00 - 8937.00] P:1612.00 E:0.095991 |  He was very, very good goalkeeper.
[8937.00 - 8944.00] P:1637.32 E:0.101919 |  Real Madrid lose possession on the half-way line, but referee Terpain says that was a foul by Canate and Venetius,
[8944.00 - 8948.00] P:1631.13 E:0.099198 |  so it's a pretty good two-way on Madrid, 5 or 6 yards inside their own half.
[8948.00 - 8953.00] P:1433.27 E:0.090534 |  Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 0 on this fabulous sporting weekend.
[8953.00 - 8957.00] P:1420.06 E:0.092596 |  We've brought you all of the rugby drama today in Rugby Union and Rugby League.
[8957.00 - 8963.00] P:1238.03 E:0.088065 |  We've got the Monaco Grand Prix tomorrow. Listen to that with us on 5 live.
[8963.00 - 8969.00] P:1500.16 E:0.083741 |  There's tennis commentary as well tomorrow from Roland Caross over on the other side of Paris.
[8969.00 - 8974.00] P:1240.25 E:0.084787 |  It is Paris in the springtime. How romantic, Chris.
[8974.00 - 8978.00] P:1656.17 E:0.086458 |  Here's Modric, who plays the ball back across.
[8978.00 - 8980.00] P:1620.91 E:0.099722 |  I noticed you came to me first there and not Alan.
[8980.00 - 8982.00] P:1719.96 E:0.056474 |  Well, you're certainly next to me.
[8982.00 - 8989.00] P:1529.81 E:0.072706 |  Here's Madrid with Croce, and then Alaba takes it forward, the Austrian.
[8989.00 - 8993.00] P:1652.63 E:0.090262 |  He's going for the left-hand side, Venetius, drags it back, Mendy joining in.
[8993.00 - 8998.00] P:1763.37 E:0.096197 |  Back he goes to the half-way line, and left-footed ball over the top.
[8998.00 - 9001.00] P:1812.82 E:0.096147 |  Benzema is just dangerous. Benzema takes it down onto his left foot,
[9001.00 - 9004.00] P:1815.51 E:0.103930 |  but Alasen came out. Liverpool haven't cleared it.
[9004.00 - 9007.00] P:1882.79 E:0.113985 |  Benzema should score. All the offside flags up.
[9007.00 - 9012.00] P:1732.41 E:0.105254 |  He puts the ball in the net, but he came back from an offside position there,
[9012.00 - 9015.00] P:1748.57 E:0.096265 |  having been closed down by Alasen.
[9015.00 - 9019.00] P:1789.31 E:0.090979 |  But Hartz in mouth. The offside flag went up.
[9019.00 - 9024.00] P:1784.19 E:0.086651 |  VAR will have to confirm that, but I think he's got it right, the official.
[9024.00 - 9028.00] P:1769.35 E:0.083955 |  What about his run to begin with though, Chris? His running behind.
[9028.00 - 9032.00] P:1807.69 E:0.096253 |  Had all the hallmarks of a top quality sent the forward away from Van Dijk.
[9032.00 - 9036.00] P:1805.33 E:0.085888 |  He takes it with his right foot, then cuts back on that left foot.
[9036.00 - 9040.00] P:1779.23 E:0.082976 |  It then gets blocked. Then they couldn't get it away.
[9040.00 - 9044.00] P:1901.88 E:0.091193 |  Alasen tries to flick it away. Canate tries to do exactly the same.
[9044.00 - 9049.00] P:1839.43 E:0.092090 |  And the ball falls back into Benzema, who we think is offside.
[9049.00 - 9054.00] P:1729.29 E:0.089403 |  They are just checking this. The thing here was the goalkeeper was actually
[9054.00 - 9059.00] P:1682.66 E:0.095921 |  beyond Benzema, closer to the edge of the penalty area than Benzema was.
[9059.00 - 9062.00] P:1624.28 E:0.084717 |  And there were two defenders in there as well.
[9062.00 - 9067.00] P:1684.51 E:0.086893 |  And Clement Erpand is waiting for this, and now we're seeing the crucial moment.
[9067.00 - 9073.00] P:1689.60 E:0.090926 |  And yeah, he is offside. He's actually bending down in the way that the player's taken the knee, actually.
[9073.00 - 9077.00] P:1692.15 E:0.089783 |  His outstretched left heel is certainly in an offside position,
[9077.00 - 9079.00] P:1703.75 E:0.085036 |  so we're just waiting for confirmation of that.
[9079.00 - 9087.00] P:1723.15 E:0.088712 |  Well, hang on. They are also checking for a foul by a cacking player leading up to a goal.
[9087.00 - 9091.00] P:1629.58 E:0.098599 |  So the goal check is continuing here.
[9091.00 - 9095.00] P:1622.75 E:0.087186 |  And this is taking some time.
[9095.00 - 9099.00] P:1752.67 E:0.089099 |  Well, the longer this goes...
[9099.00 - 9102.00] P:1668.89 E:0.105192 |  ...the more reason to worry there is for Liverpool.
[9102.00 - 9105.00] P:1622.88 E:0.096710 |  And on the big screens in the ground as well, goal check.
[9105.00 - 9107.00] P:1733.05 E:0.082938 |  Liverpool have got the ball in position.
[9107.00 - 9110.00] P:1803.58 E:0.078956 |  Waiting to take the free kick.
[9110.00 - 9114.00] P:1783.03 E:0.096367 |  But it's still set, and it's now saying checking offside.
[9114.00 - 9120.00] P:1864.43 E:0.099830 |  So they're happy with the initial foul, and they're now checking offside, leading up to the goal.
[9120.00 - 9123.00] P:1926.61 E:0.097407 |  So there have been a number of things that they've looked at here.
[9123.00 - 9128.00] P:1929.98 E:0.091132 |  They'll be checking a couple of the initial run from Benzema.
[9128.00 - 9135.00] P:1805.95 E:0.098599 |  And then there's coming together, I can't tell you, in Allyson, whether he's offside.
[9135.00 - 9137.00] P:1857.06 E:0.096417 |  Or does it... It doesn't take a deflection...
[9137.00 - 9140.00] P:1717.53 E:0.078049 |  ...from a Liverpool player back to Benzema.
[9140.00 - 9142.00] P:1738.58 E:0.102183 |  Is that what they're looking at?
[9142.00 - 9146.00] P:1847.05 E:0.092681 |  Well, if it comes off for Benio, to Benzema, then the goal will stand.
[9146.00 - 9153.00] P:1804.14 E:0.086598 |  Yeah, and it might do. This is very messy, because as Benzema worked it across,
[9153.00 - 9158.00] P:1704.72 E:0.090304 |  it's a good effort, and we're now, I think, going to see the crucial replay, which will indicate...
[9158.00 - 9163.00] P:1761.13 E:0.087848 |  ...it bounces off, it bounces off for Benio and back to Benzema.
[9163.00 - 9165.00] P:1777.52 E:0.105316 |  And that's going to be a goal, I think.
[9165.00 - 9169.00] P:1760.21 E:0.091709 |  This is going to be a goal. It appeared initially that Benzema was in an offside position,
[9169.00 - 9172.00] P:1761.84 E:0.085664 |  so I can understand the assistant flagging for this.
[9172.00 - 9176.00] P:1816.71 E:0.096580 |  But a long, long process has gone through here, and it looked as though,
[9176.00 - 9181.00] P:1841.07 E:0.095580 |  even though Benzema was in an offside position, that the ball bounced by the sliding for Benio
[9181.00 - 9185.00] P:1822.51 E:0.096008 |  off his knee through to Benzema, who was able to put it in the net.
[9185.00 - 9190.00] P:1705.27 E:0.092909 |  And it might well be that he's got another goal in a Champions League final, Benzema.
[9190.00 - 9192.00] P:1553.83 E:0.105209 |  He scored in Kiev against Liverpool.
[9192.00 - 9199.00] P:1661.54 E:0.098316 |  This would be his 45th goal of the best goal-scoring season the 34-year-old has ever had.
[9199.00 - 9202.00] P:1612.37 E:0.089892 |  Real Madrid fans, they're celebrating.
[9202.00 - 9208.00] P:1635.02 E:0.103191 |  I think the word has already gone round in the stands, and there's the indicator.
[9208.00 - 9209.00] P:1868.78 E:0.108857 |  Offside.
[9209.00 - 9211.00] P:1859.50 E:0.108537 |  He has seen it, he's offside.
[9211.00 - 9214.00] P:1884.17 E:0.105166 |  So why were the Real Madrid fans celebrating?
[9214.00 - 9216.00] P:1902.96 E:0.102806 |  And the goal is ruled out.
[9216.00 - 9220.00] P:1833.91 E:0.090130 |  Well, I can't work with that one out, because it didn't look offside to me.
[9220.00 - 9225.00] P:1661.13 E:0.091929 |  It looked as if it did come off for Benio, which we saw pretty clearly.
[9225.00 - 9227.00] P:1558.57 E:0.095438 |  Well, that looks like...
[9227.00 - 9230.00] P:1714.56 E:0.106312 |  On the evidence that we've had in front of us, that looks like a big light.
[9230.00 - 9235.00] P:1712.54 E:0.094001 |  Oh, Alisson caught in possession by Benzema, and it bounced away off-bam.
[9235.00 - 9239.00] P:1642.24 E:0.096155 |  Benzema out towards the far side, that could have gone anywhere off Alisson.
[9239.00 - 9243.00] P:1678.99 E:0.101650 |  And there were memories there of Benzema and Karius in Kiev four years ago.
[9243.00 - 9246.00] P:1762.45 E:0.077083 |  But this time, Alisson got lucky.
[9248.00 - 9250.00] P:1623.52 E:0.124088 |  They did get very, very lucky.
[9250.00 - 9252.00] P:1791.15 E:0.095411 |  Liverpool just having...
[9253.00 - 9256.00] P:1732.09 E:0.111858 |  Panning this last couple of minutes, they've dominated the first half.
[9256.00 - 9260.00] P:1750.21 E:0.089342 |  But this is Real Madrid in the Champions League this season, isn't it?
[9260.00 - 9264.00] P:1700.16 E:0.066867 |  Just these little moments.
[9264.00 - 9266.00] P:1812.32 E:0.084437 |  And they make it back.
[9266.00 - 9268.00] P:1735.70 E:0.092073 |  So typical, though, isn't it?
[9268.00 - 9272.00] P:1759.45 E:0.087669 |  Liverpool had the best chances, two very good chances by their standards.
[9272.00 - 9274.00] P:1589.45 E:0.099729 |  Real Madrid doing a lot of defending.
[9274.00 - 9276.00] P:1618.38 E:0.104180 |  Liverpool passing them moving really well.
[9276.00 - 9282.00] P:1741.25 E:0.084516 |  And that one piece of magic, that one pass, that one quality running behind from Benzema,
[9282.00 - 9284.00] P:1750.35 E:0.112934 |  Liverpool all over the place.
[9284.00 - 9289.00] P:1566.91 E:0.087993 |  I'm very much looking forward to somebody explaining the process that they went through for that.
[9289.00 - 9292.00] P:1700.21 E:0.089545 |  The ruling out of the Real Madrid goal.
[9292.00 - 9297.00] P:1638.61 E:0.093048 |  We've got confusion as well, because on the big boards inside the stadium,
[9297.00 - 9301.00] P:1703.78 E:0.097697 |  it said two minutes of added time, but the fourth official showed three minutes of added time.
[9301.00 - 9306.00] P:1612.65 E:0.085835 |  I think that maybe sums up some of the organisation that we've seen around this final tonight.
[9306.00 - 9310.00] P:1559.59 E:0.087128 |  But it is still Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 0.
[9310.00 - 9315.00] P:1674.87 E:0.082335 |  I don't know what the talking point the discussion is going to be at half time after...
[9315.00 - 9321.00] P:1547.49 E:0.085442 |  It looked initially as though it would be a straightforward decision to rule out the Benzema goal.
[9321.00 - 9323.00] P:1620.36 E:0.094901 |  And it went on and on and on.
[9323.00 - 9325.00] P:1851.51 E:0.102547 |  They looked at two or three different things.
[9325.00 - 9331.00] P:1939.78 E:0.100913 |  And in the end, just as we thought it was going to be allowed, it was disallowed.
[9331.00 - 9334.00] P:1805.51 E:0.090092 |  So it's still 0-0. Thiago's giving it away.
[9334.00 - 9337.00] P:1769.99 E:0.083818 |  Liverpool suddenly a little rattled.
[9337.00 - 9340.00] P:1569.52 E:0.092560 |  But Canate is able to intercept this latest pass downfield.
[9340.00 - 9342.00] P:1696.73 E:0.103128 |  And there is the half time whistle.
[9342.00 - 9348.00] P:1956.78 E:0.098548 |  And Jurgen Klopp has a look at his watch and runs away down the tunnel, out of our sight.
[9348.00 - 9352.00] P:1812.88 E:0.095922 |  Liverpool going for their third cup win of the season.
[9352.00 - 9354.00] P:1635.58 E:0.101773 |  0-0 in the Carabao Cup final.
[9354.00 - 9356.00] P:1327.14 E:0.100864 |  0-0 in the Atec Cup final.
[9356.00 - 9361.00] P:1557.18 E:0.090523 |  And here in Sandinay at half time in the Champions League final,
[9361.00 - 9364.00] P:1568.93 E:0.085339 |  it's Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 0.
[9364.00 - 9366.00] P:1687.13 E:0.065883 |  Alan Shearer and Chris Hill.
[9366.00 - 9370.00] P:1758.50 E:0.087046 |  Yeah, well Liverpool really dominated the first half and quarter.
[9370.00 - 9372.00] P:1821.51 E:0.091350 |  That one fabulous save.
[9372.00 - 9375.00] P:1706.87 E:0.086829 |  He's right fingertips that have all onto the post.
[9375.00 - 9377.00] P:1712.54 E:0.087944 |  That was a big moment.
[9377.00 - 9380.00] P:1695.01 E:0.091106 |  But then Real Madrid right at the end of the first half,
[9380.00 - 9383.00] P:1665.23 E:0.093427 |  controversy I suppose will be really interesting.
[9383.00 - 9386.00] P:1737.11 E:0.102643 |  Obviously offside, BAR had a long, long check.
[9386.00 - 9390.00] P:1713.29 E:0.100322 |  The longer it went, we thought the goal was going to be awarded.
[9390.00 - 9393.00] P:1723.06 E:0.088511 |  But that's Real Madrid's danger and Benzema's danger Alan.
[9393.00 - 9396.00] P:1724.72 E:0.094939 |  Well for 44 minutes, Liverpool pretty much dominated.
[9396.00 - 9397.00] P:1871.17 E:0.093322 |  Didn't they?
[9397.00 - 9399.00] P:1685.69 E:0.088688 |  Dominated a possession, pushed around Madrid back.
[9399.00 - 9401.00] P:1634.13 E:0.091444 |  Look, dangerous on the break.
[9401.00 - 9405.00] P:1568.53 E:0.077176 |  Had two good chances by their standards.
[9405.00 - 9407.00] P:1642.30 E:0.097067 |  One good save from Kota.
[9407.00 - 9409.00] P:1693.60 E:0.088513 |  One unbelievable save from Kota.
[9409.00 - 9413.00] P:1703.60 E:0.090480 |  Down to his right-hand side to push it onto that post.
[9413.00 - 9415.00] P:1807.23 E:0.094706 |  But typical Real Madrid, we've said it.
[9415.00 - 9417.00] P:1870.84 E:0.091514 |  They do concede chances.
[9417.00 - 9419.00] P:1798.95 E:0.088179 |  If you don't take them, they punish it.
[9419.00 - 9421.00] P:1597.53 E:0.086696 |  But the ability that they've got up front,
[9421.00 - 9424.00] P:1748.86 E:0.096916 |  and that proved that last minute or two of the half,
[9424.00 - 9426.00] P:1951.56 E:0.090309 |  the pass through, the running behind was exceptional.
[9426.00 - 9428.00] P:1723.22 E:0.091337 |  And he could have finished it off beforehand.
[9428.00 - 9430.00] P:1692.32 E:0.093212 |  But Liverpool got away with one there.
[9431.00 - 9434.00] P:1702.84 E:0.092682 |  So there we are, half-time here in the Stade de France.
[9434.00 - 9438.00] P:1702.11 E:0.078168 |  It's Liverpool, Nail, Real Madrid, Nail.
[9438.00 - 9442.00] P:1776.82 E:0.063578 |  Right, on the offside, I think it is...
[9442.00 - 9446.00] P:1740.14 E:0.082085 |  I think you have to intend to play the ball as a defender.
[9446.00 - 9450.00] P:1870.13 E:0.080977 |  And if you're not intending to play the ball and it deflects off you,
[9450.00 - 9452.00] P:1565.22 E:0.092081 |  it's still offside.
[9452.00 - 9455.00] P:1727.50 E:0.087364 |  That is my understanding, although nobody else is picking up a microphone,
[9455.00 - 9458.00] P:1810.36 E:0.091852 |  therefore maybe I might be on my own.
[9458.00 - 9461.00] P:1837.54 E:0.099914 |  I'll have to see it again to see if it was intended.
[9461.00 - 9464.00] P:1926.49 E:0.100141 |  I know there was a bit of a melee in that box,
[9464.00 - 9466.00] P:1664.87 E:0.081696 |  and a bit of a panic scramble.
[9466.00 - 9469.00] P:1702.16 E:0.096887 |  And whether the ball just got hit off for being your thigh,
[9469.00 - 9473.00] P:1606.97 E:0.091274 |  then went into the path of Benzemaugh.
[9473.00 - 9475.00] P:1866.83 E:0.095845 |  But I would have to see that again.
[9475.00 - 9480.00] P:1728.69 E:0.090267 |  I think the use of the word intended is really interesting.
[9480.00 - 9483.00] P:1785.51 E:0.093764 |  You're intending to make a challenge,
[9483.00 - 9485.00] P:1761.72 E:0.083959 |  and the ball goes a certain way.
[9485.00 - 9487.00] P:1789.65 E:0.088992 |  That's a good point.
[9487.00 - 9489.00] P:1673.18 E:0.099009 |  How can you read that?
[9489.00 - 9492.00] P:1871.50 E:0.087482 |  Intending to play the ball versus intending to make a challenge,
[9492.00 - 9494.00] P:1951.53 E:0.099848 |  which involves playing the ball.
[9494.00 - 9496.00] P:1781.72 E:0.086925 |  He's in there for a reason.
[9496.00 - 9499.00] P:1800.58 E:0.084759 |  He's in there to try and stop that ball getting to Benzemaugh.
[9499.00 - 9502.00] P:1840.13 E:0.075789 |  So if he's in there and the ball deflects off him,
[9502.00 - 9506.00] P:1741.64 E:0.077126 |  then I don't see how that can or should be their fault.
[9506.00 - 9508.00] P:1473.61 E:0.068074 |  He's intending to get the ball.
[9508.00 - 9510.00] P:1830.88 E:0.062198 |  Absolutely.
[9510.00 - 9512.00] P:1893.36 E:0.088154 |  Interesting.
[9512.00 - 9516.00] P:1928.40 E:0.075970 |  It might actually be the first thing that's happened
[9516.00 - 9519.00] P:1728.83 E:0.076189 |  over the course of the last few weeks, Alan,
[9519.00 - 9522.00] P:1882.18 E:0.085293 |  that would make any Real Madrid fan feel anything other
[9522.00 - 9524.00] P:1760.22 E:0.074264 |  than they're destined to win this tournament.
[9524.00 - 9526.00] P:1760.96 E:0.091881 |  Because I feel like Real Madrid fans,
[9526.00 - 9528.00] P:1821.22 E:0.085379 |  after all the comebacks they've had,
[9528.00 - 9530.00] P:1949.97 E:0.086342 |  they'll think this is our tournament, we must win.
[9530.00 - 9532.00] P:1802.49 E:0.080100 |  Then the goalkeeper, Palms, went on to the post.
[9532.00 - 9534.00] P:1806.54 E:0.063322 |  Finally, something's gone against him.
[9534.00 - 9536.00] P:1830.27 E:0.089517 |  Well, we were having the chat beforehand,
[9536.00 - 9539.00] P:1785.83 E:0.080875 |  when we were where Chris sort of strongly fancied Liverpool.
[9539.00 - 9543.00] P:1800.59 E:0.091486 |  I don't think he could be as confident because of all those situations,
[9543.00 - 9546.00] P:1814.24 E:0.083522 |  because how Real Madrid are actually in this final,
[9546.00 - 9549.00] P:1691.54 E:0.081104 |  who they've actually beaten, how they've come back in games
[9549.00 - 9551.00] P:1792.56 E:0.093928 |  where they're meant to be dead and buried.
[9551.00 - 9553.00] P:1635.75 E:0.094921 |  So there's a reason why they're actually here.
[9553.00 - 9556.00] P:1812.95 E:0.097491 |  And again, you mentioned it, that unbelievable save,
[9556.00 - 9559.00] P:1729.77 E:0.090912 |  the couple of chances that Liverpool had.
[9559.00 - 9562.00] P:1660.46 E:0.083062 |  And with those two up front, particularly Benzemaugh,
[9562.00 - 9564.00] P:1664.29 E:0.085203 |  they've still got a really good opportunity.
[9564.00 - 9566.00] P:1786.12 E:0.087581 |  Alan, Chris, John, thank you for the time being.
[9566.00 - 9570.00] P:1885.74 E:0.085679 |  We've now been joined by Steve Douglas from the Associated Press.
[9570.00 - 9572.00] P:1711.83 E:0.093852 |  Steve, I just saw on social media,
[9572.00 - 9576.00] P:1833.12 E:0.087835 |  you writing about what you experienced outside the ground.
[9576.00 - 9578.00] P:1797.67 E:0.071676 |  Can you tell us what happened to you?
[9578.00 - 9582.00] P:1651.52 E:0.067438 |  Yeah, for my personal aspect,
[9582.00 - 9586.00] P:1866.60 E:0.084729 |  we saw reports of crowd issues, let's say,
[9586.00 - 9590.00] P:1904.05 E:0.075473 |  about 40 minutes before kick-off.
[9590.00 - 9594.00] P:1772.13 E:0.084908 |  So I went outside and took video footage of two fans
[9594.00 - 9596.00] P:1689.57 E:0.062138 |  getting through the security perimeter
[9596.00 - 9601.00] P:1795.77 E:0.083403 |  and legging it onto the concourse, hoping to get into the arena.
[9601.00 - 9605.00] P:1865.00 E:0.081278 |  On both occasions, the stewards caught up with them
[9605.00 - 9608.00] P:1770.64 E:0.078019 |  and also officials, and grappled them to the floor
[9608.00 - 9611.00] P:1690.91 E:0.075676 |  and then got frogmarched out.
[9611.00 - 9614.00] P:1875.97 E:0.082402 |  On the second occasion, I was really close to my camera
[9614.00 - 9618.00] P:1801.12 E:0.086269 |  getting video footage, and the one-on-one security guards
[9618.00 - 9621.00] P:1642.02 E:0.079744 |  came up to me, grabbed me by the arm,
[9622.00 - 9625.00] P:1780.98 E:0.088906 |  frogmarched me into the hut next to the gate
[9625.00 - 9628.00] P:1862.15 E:0.072500 |  and said various things in French.
[9628.00 - 9631.00] P:1648.76 E:0.085784 |  I was like, OK, what are you doing?
[9631.00 - 9635.00] P:1812.84 E:0.086840 |  Then he said, you've got to delete all the video footage that you took.
[9635.00 - 9639.00] P:1769.60 E:0.080053 |  By that stage, he'd taken off my accreditation,
[9639.00 - 9641.00] P:1552.49 E:0.095157 |  and then I was basically concerned.
[9641.00 - 9643.00] P:1531.67 E:0.086400 |  I'd be done for, I'd be out of the stadium
[9643.00 - 9645.00] P:1605.55 E:0.092274 |  and not be able to come to a match.
[9645.00 - 9647.00] P:1572.34 E:0.098601 |  So he made me delete all my footage,
[9647.00 - 9650.00] P:1664.37 E:0.085294 |  went through all my videos of my kids and stuff,
[9650.00 - 9655.00] P:1599.05 E:0.094168 |  and videos and photos, and then he gave me phone back,
[9655.00 - 9658.00] P:1613.01 E:0.088745 |  gave me my accreditation back, and I came back in.
[9658.00 - 9660.00] P:1731.22 E:0.084045 |  That must have been incredibly distressing.
[9660.00 - 9664.00] P:1748.36 E:0.076966 |  Yeah, well, I was more worried about not being able to come to a match.
[9664.00 - 9666.00] P:1707.86 E:0.089191 |  No, it didn't hurt me anything.
[9666.00 - 9668.00] P:1823.97 E:0.082048 |  It was just a bit worrying.
[9668.00 - 9671.00] P:1704.43 E:0.085634 |  Some of the reporters, other reporters from PA and Tom King
[9671.00 - 9676.00] P:1746.59 E:0.092924 |  from the mail were there, checking out, OK, but everything was fine.
[9676.00 - 9678.00] P:1755.20 E:0.091982 |  Steve, thank you for coming and talking to us.
[9678.00 - 9680.00] P:1753.83 E:0.077504 |  Glad you were OK, and yeah, we'll speak to you again.
[9680.00 - 9681.00] P:1716.82 E:0.068270 |  I'm sure, thank you.
[9681.00 - 9683.00] P:1892.36 E:0.084337 |  Steve Douglas from the Associated Press,
[9683.00 - 9687.00] P:1819.41 E:0.085200 |  and Steve's colleague Rob as well, who we have on the show quite often,
[9687.00 - 9691.00] P:1838.37 E:0.080807 |  has just tweeted to say that UEFA personnel here
[9691.00 - 9695.00] P:1831.85 E:0.080017 |  actually had to stop the security forces outside
[9695.00 - 9700.00] P:1786.81 E:0.073434 |  from preventing journalists from filming what they were doing.
[9700.00 - 9703.00] P:1789.09 E:0.080340 |  So bear in mind, we've talked about UEFA and their statements
[9703.00 - 9704.00] P:1796.22 E:0.071064 |  and that kind of thing.
[9704.00 - 9707.00] P:1758.20 E:0.086068 |  It's the French Football Federation who are in charge of policing around the ground,
[9707.00 - 9709.00] P:1806.45 E:0.082066 |  and that is a very distressing thing to read.
[9709.00 - 9711.00] P:1746.39 E:0.085800 |  Let's bring in Five Lives Chris Worberton now.
[9711.00 - 9713.00] P:1843.94 E:0.085558 |  Chris, you're still outside the stand to France, yeah?
[9713.00 - 9714.00] P:1935.52 E:0.049189 |  Yeah, I am.
[9714.00 - 9718.00] P:2085.55 E:0.091386 |  When you say still, see, I wasn't actually due to be at the stadium this evening,
[9718.00 - 9721.00] P:1820.77 E:0.093888 |  so as soon as we started getting all the reports,
[9721.00 - 9725.00] P:1795.85 E:0.088563 |  we headed up here as soon as we could from a more central part of the city.
[9725.00 - 9729.00] P:1760.38 E:0.085780 |  And we got here, obviously tried to get to where all the Liverpool fans
[9729.00 - 9731.00] P:1818.98 E:0.081457 |  were still trying to get into the stadium, Steve.
[9731.00 - 9735.00] P:1787.09 E:0.083577 |  And there's an underpass when we got here, a big long stretch,
[9735.00 - 9738.00] P:1704.78 E:0.092647 |  similar as opposed to Wembley Way, and then we got to the underpass,
[9738.00 - 9739.00] P:1967.25 E:0.075655 |  which we needed to get through.
[9739.00 - 9744.00] P:1661.37 E:0.078417 |  There were loads of locals, really, groups of lads, further ahead.
[9744.00 - 9746.00] P:1730.99 E:0.074769 |  And then tear gas was fired by the police.
[9746.00 - 9749.00] P:1737.02 E:0.088023 |  Everyone ran back, including us.
[9749.00 - 9752.00] P:1773.04 E:0.074499 |  Very chaotic, very panicky.
[9752.00 - 9755.00] P:1831.92 E:0.069059 |  You could feel it in your eyes, you could taste it in your mouth.
[9755.00 - 9759.00] P:1657.18 E:0.072626 |  Now, we were then trying to get nearer from our position.
[9759.00 - 9762.00] P:1675.14 E:0.085990 |  It's very, very difficult because mainly there's a riot police position
[9762.00 - 9764.00] P:1869.96 E:0.086383 |  on most of the intersections around here,
[9764.00 - 9767.00] P:1759.13 E:0.074982 |  particularly on the external gates, where you've got the concourse
[9767.00 - 9770.00] P:1771.20 E:0.088895 |  that was just being described by our guests there,
[9770.00 - 9772.00] P:1571.29 E:0.080232 |  all the bars and all of that kind of stuff,
[9772.00 - 9776.00] P:1603.63 E:0.088391 |  has calmed down a bit again in the past 15 minutes or so.
[9776.00 - 9780.00] P:1418.79 E:0.089906 |  Of course, a few Liverpool fans have walked past where we are here.
[9780.00 - 9784.00] P:1545.72 E:0.078473 |  You can see on their face what they've gone through one way or another,
[9784.00 - 9788.00] P:1599.37 E:0.085703 |  not in the mood to talk broadly, and I'm not pushing them after all of this.
[9788.00 - 9792.00] P:1582.08 E:0.087310 |  I did speak to a group of young lads, though, Tyler, he was one of them.
[9792.00 - 9796.00] P:1613.30 E:0.081671 |  This was a point where, I can see in his eyes, he was getting red eyes,
[9796.00 - 9798.00] P:1702.40 E:0.084836 |  I had red eyes as we were talking to each other.
[9798.00 - 9802.00] P:1674.39 E:0.084630 |  He arrived here with his mates at the ground around about 7 o'clock as you're here,
[9802.00 - 9806.00] P:1456.96 E:0.073868 |  and also as you're here, he paid £1,000 for his ticket.
[9806.00 - 9809.00] P:1241.45 E:0.094495 |  So we got here at 7, we were all queuing up,
[9809.00 - 9814.00] P:1336.13 E:0.064207 |  and then about half an hour goes by, no barriers are open at all.
[9814.00 - 9818.00] P:1477.80 E:0.084068 |  And then they teargassed the barrier next to us, both sides,
[9818.00 - 9822.00] P:1416.15 E:0.074958 |  so we see people running, and then we didn't know what was happening.
[9822.00 - 9825.00] P:1376.61 E:0.074796 |  We tried getting in, but our tickets were broken,
[9825.00 - 9828.00] P:1499.05 E:0.085966 |  and they were just throwing people out, punching people,
[9828.00 - 9830.00] P:1153.95 E:0.083454 |  doing everything they can to stop them getting in.
[9830.00 - 9834.00] P:1594.02 E:0.081124 |  When the teargassed came, because I was following it on social media, right,
[9834.00 - 9836.00] P:1471.32 E:0.098035 |  and they were saying there were families there.
[9836.00 - 9839.00] P:1454.39 E:0.084733 |  Yeah, there was people in wheelchairs, old lads,
[9839.00 - 9843.00] P:1434.11 E:0.082311 |  and they were walking six and everything, it just wasn't on at all.
[9843.00 - 9845.00] P:1343.51 E:0.078018 |  It wasn't on at all.
[9845.00 - 9849.00] P:1468.78 E:0.092068 |  So it wasn't just separate people getting teargassed or sprayed or whatever,
[9849.00 - 9852.00] P:1292.24 E:0.081147 |  it was groups and groups of people with these old people in
[9852.00 - 9855.00] P:1440.92 E:0.083039 |  that could easily have their lives stopped there as a joke.
[9855.00 - 9858.00] P:1572.29 E:0.091282 |  What do you think of the fact that there's all this chaos going out,
[9858.00 - 9861.00] P:1596.64 E:0.082088 |  and yet that game's going on, we can hear it?
[9861.00 - 9863.00] P:1234.21 E:0.087658 |  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[9863.00 - 9867.00] P:1319.48 E:0.090340 |  We got told about 45 minutes before that our end was filled,
[9867.00 - 9870.00] P:1551.77 E:0.083293 |  whilst there was thousands outside, so I can't assume there was fake tickets,
[9870.00 - 9872.00] P:1079.89 E:0.098736 |  people jumping over and running in to get in.
[9872.00 - 9875.00] P:1247.43 E:0.098437 |  So I'm fair and everyone actually paying the money to get their tickets?
[9875.00 - 9877.00] P:1568.79 E:0.076149 |  Well, when you talk about paying money,
[9877.00 - 9879.00] P:1446.48 E:0.106801 |  I mean, how long have you been looking forward to this?
[9879.00 - 9880.00] P:1454.53 E:0.097061 |  What did you have to sacrifice?
[9880.00 - 9882.00] P:1357.41 E:0.100473 |  I've come up today that I was getting a ticket.
[9882.00 - 9886.00] P:1161.07 E:0.081498 |  It's the happiest I've been in a long time to go in and have my ticket not be scanned
[9886.00 - 9889.00] P:1520.45 E:0.093996 |  three times and get kicked out, pushed and shoved by stewards.
[9889.00 - 9892.00] P:1241.63 E:0.079303 |  It's just not on. That's always...
[9892.00 - 9894.00] P:1292.72 E:0.111907 |  So what are you going to do now?
[9894.00 - 9896.00] P:960.74 E:0.086105 |  We have no idea what we're going to do.
[9896.00 - 9897.00] P:1265.64 E:0.060986 |  We're just going to...
[9897.00 - 9900.00] P:1047.88 E:0.084520 |  I'll step... His dad is in there at the moment,
[9900.00 - 9902.00] P:1124.45 E:0.104895 |  we just have to wait for him until we can get away back to the hotel
[9902.00 - 9903.00] P:1306.12 E:0.076110 |  because there's no taxis or anything.
[9903.00 - 9906.00] P:1589.12 E:0.087181 |  And the mad thing now is, I mean, you can feel it in the air, can't you?
[9906.00 - 9907.00] P:1561.12 E:0.116795 |  You can feel it in your eyes.
[9907.00 - 9909.00] P:1050.51 E:0.079980 |  Yeah, we've had to go out three times, have water,
[9909.00 - 9911.00] P:1441.83 E:0.072293 |  lots of splashing on our eyes and everything, because it's just horrendous.
[9911.00 - 9913.00] P:1371.16 E:0.089881 |  It starts well, and other people...
[9913.00 - 9916.00] P:1362.83 E:0.074570 |  But they said they were delaying the match by 15 minutes
[9916.00 - 9918.00] P:1271.92 E:0.095910 |  because fans had turned up late.
[9918.00 - 9920.00] P:1305.55 E:0.085684 |  That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[9920.00 - 9922.00] P:1244.87 E:0.074424 |  Because thousands and thousands of people got here at six o'clock
[9922.00 - 9924.00] P:1493.10 E:0.081055 |  when the gates actually opened for them to wait until nine o'clock
[9924.00 - 9927.00] P:1325.61 E:0.081793 |  when the game was supposed to kick off, not to be open.
[9927.00 - 9928.00] P:1768.23 E:0.074971 |  It's ridiculous.
[9928.00 - 9930.00] P:1387.10 E:0.084895 |  And the fact that people still want to go...
[9930.00 - 9932.00] P:1183.61 E:0.093616 |  Good for them, they want to still go in, but I can't be more angry
[9932.00 - 9935.00] P:1161.65 E:0.084638 |  at the fact that we didn't get that in for a valid ticket.
[9935.00 - 9937.00] P:1644.00 E:0.084269 |  And the police just have no respect for it.
[9937.00 - 9938.00] P:1270.19 E:0.070738 |  I paid £1,000 for my ticket.
[9938.00 - 9939.00] P:1484.00 E:0.103161 |  You paid a grand?
[9939.00 - 9940.00] P:815.38 E:0.060288 |  £1,000.
[9940.00 - 9942.00] P:1507.09 E:0.084463 |  That's what you got, you paid it today?
[9942.00 - 9947.00] P:1119.88 E:0.081406 |  It was a real ticket, but they didn't want anything to do with it at all.
[9947.00 - 9950.00] P:1880.02 E:0.056104 |  Well, Tyler, when he's talking about seven o'clock,
[9950.00 - 9953.00] P:1928.55 E:0.082859 |  just to remind you, he's talking about getting here at seven o'clock
[9953.00 - 9957.00] P:1616.14 E:0.076267 |  France time, so a couple of hours before kick-off, Steve,
[9957.00 - 9959.00] P:1573.38 E:0.074705 |  it's kind of dispersing here.
[9959.00 - 9961.00] P:1657.87 E:0.063991 |  It has improved a fair bit.
[9961.00 - 9964.00] P:1625.48 E:0.083265 |  It has been a pretty grim atmosphere out here
[9964.00 - 9967.00] P:1667.01 E:0.080420 |  since we arrived about an hour and a half or so ago.
[9967.00 - 9971.00] P:1815.00 E:0.083774 |  And you just have to think of all the people who have spent so much financially,
[9971.00 - 9974.00] P:1923.55 E:0.080455 |  emotionally, the investment they've put into getting here
[9974.00 - 9976.00] P:1809.74 E:0.081827 |  to being a part of this experience as well.
[9976.00 - 9977.00] P:1773.88 E:0.087250 |  And do you know what?
[9977.00 - 9980.00] P:1746.76 E:0.084252 |  When I've come here now, I've just thought this is so in contrast
[9980.00 - 9983.00] P:1764.00 E:0.086144 |  to everything we experienced earlier on today
[9983.00 - 9986.00] P:1750.83 E:0.079844 |  when we went to that fan zone with tens of thousands
[9986.00 - 9989.00] P:1552.04 E:0.084488 |  of Liverpool fans up for it, having the time of their lives
[9989.00 - 9992.00] P:1554.05 E:0.081768 |  and looking forward to what they hope would be one of the best evenings
[9992.00 - 9994.00] P:1628.07 E:0.065551 |  of their lives as well, Steve.
[9995.00 - 9996.00] P:1583.49 E:0.097767 |  Chris, thank you very much indeed.
[9996.00 - 9998.00] P:1858.38 E:0.085076 |  That's Five Live Chris Wilberton.
[9998.00 - 10000.00] P:1640.67 E:0.092334 |  Chris will be on air tomorrow morning from 6am
[10000.00 - 10003.00] P:1507.15 E:0.084539 |  with Five Live Breakfast live from here in Paris.
[10003.00 - 10006.00] P:1641.22 E:0.084268 |  And of course, we're going to be hearing much more about what has happened here
[10006.00 - 10007.00] P:1720.55 E:0.078712 |  outside the Stade de France.
[10007.00 - 10010.00] P:1902.12 E:0.079678 |  I was wondering actually, just as Chris was queuing into that interview,
[10010.00 - 10014.00] P:1729.74 E:0.080328 |  would it be anger, would it be fear, would it be tears,
[10014.00 - 10016.00] P:2001.20 E:0.094795 |  what would be the abiding emotion
[10016.00 - 10018.00] P:1823.71 E:0.086327 |  and listening to those fans there?
[10018.00 - 10021.00] P:1743.11 E:0.085321 |  It's disbelief, isn't it, from those Liverpool supporters outside
[10021.00 - 10023.00] P:1856.98 E:0.092162 |  and there will be all manner of emotions
[10023.00 - 10026.00] P:1873.27 E:0.085001 |  and so many distressing scenes outside the stadium,
[10026.00 - 10028.00] P:1947.17 E:0.081777 |  inside the stadium on the pitch.
[10028.00 - 10032.00] P:1911.02 E:0.082997 |  It's Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 0 in the Champions League final.
[10032.00 - 10034.00] P:2038.57 E:0.094416 |  Thibault Courtois making a sensational save,
[10034.00 - 10037.00] P:1668.21 E:0.078173 |  tipping Sadio Manet's effort onto the post.
[10037.00 - 10039.00] P:1830.47 E:0.079939 |  And at the other end, Karim Bentemer's goal
[10039.00 - 10042.00] P:1864.68 E:0.077920 |  very controversially disallowed for offside.
[10042.00 - 10045.00] P:1674.87 E:0.068386 |  The second half comes next after the news with Karl Hartley.
[10045.00 - 10048.00] P:1479.91 E:0.122611 |  Listen on BBC Sounds.
[10048.00 - 10051.00] P:1499.92 E:0.120881 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[10051.00 - 10055.00] P:1761.25 E:0.090708 |  UEFA is blaming a security issue for the delayed starter
[10055.00 - 10058.00] P:1607.05 E:0.088372 |  to the Champions League final, while stadium announcements said
[10058.00 - 10061.00] P:1608.86 E:0.069373 |  it was down to fans arriving late.
[10061.00 - 10065.00] P:1843.43 E:0.078928 |  The match kicked off 36 minutes later than scheduled
[10065.00 - 10067.00] P:1461.88 E:0.085317 |  with many Liverpool supporters with tickets,
[10067.00 - 10070.00] P:1798.10 E:0.072893 |  as you've just been hearing, still outside.
[10070.00 - 10073.00] P:1498.68 E:0.081409 |  North-west sports reporter for the Daily Mail, Dom King,
[10073.00 - 10075.00] P:1521.03 E:0.060648 |  was with Liverpool supporters.
[10075.00 - 10077.00] P:1639.48 E:0.097324 |  They're being pepper sprayed by French police.
[10077.00 - 10080.00] P:1643.51 E:0.087218 |  There's kids in the queue, there's old people in the queue
[10080.00 - 10082.00] P:1427.77 E:0.087861 |  who've done nothing, they've been there for two hours.
[10082.00 - 10085.00] P:1555.84 E:0.078933 |  I know they've been pepper sprayed, pepper sprayed, Thibault,
[10085.00 - 10087.00] P:1555.93 E:0.088123 |  because I've felt it myself.
[10087.00 - 10090.00] P:1644.35 E:0.103350 |  A number of my colleagues who have gone to have a look at the story,
[10090.00 - 10092.00] P:1581.64 E:0.082787 |  they've felt the effects of it.
[10092.00 - 10095.00] P:1671.08 E:0.085406 |  It came from nowhere, it's all just dispersed on it.
[10095.00 - 10098.00] P:1719.96 E:0.074585 |  While the sports minister, Nadine, at Doris has tweeted
[10098.00 - 10101.00] P:1824.61 E:0.074846 |  that the issues are troubling and that she's very concerned
[10101.00 - 10103.00] P:1614.60 E:0.042972 |  for all those involved.
[10103.00 - 10106.00] P:1524.67 E:0.081735 |  Three more Conservative MPs have confirmed publicly
[10106.00 - 10109.00] P:1499.63 E:0.091298 |  that they've submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson,
[10109.00 - 10112.00] P:1479.28 E:0.071957 |  more than half a dozen Tories have now urged the Prime Minister
[10112.00 - 10116.00] P:1359.18 E:0.078913 |  to step down, since the Sue Gray report on lockdown gatherings
[10116.00 - 10118.00] P:1481.04 E:0.054773 |  in Downing Street was made public.
[10118.00 - 10120.00] P:1850.18 E:0.083038 |  The leaders of France and Germany have urged
[10120.00 - 10123.00] P:1767.88 E:0.090448 |  Vladimir Putin to hold serious negotiations
[10123.00 - 10126.00] P:1553.11 E:0.074111 |  with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky
[10126.00 - 10129.00] P:1565.06 E:0.071658 |  on how to bring the war in Ukraine to an end.
[10129.00 - 10133.00] P:1618.17 E:0.067632 |  Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Slotts spoke to the Russian President
[10133.00 - 10138.00] P:1711.03 E:0.061767 |  by phone for 80 minutes in the first joint conversation since March.
[10138.00 - 10143.00] P:1688.17 E:0.078231 |  A super yacht has sunk in a torquillet marina after bursting into flames.
[10143.00 - 10145.00] P:1583.46 E:0.063101 |  Firefighters have contained the fire,
[10145.00 - 10149.00] P:1635.17 E:0.076891 |  but there are now environmental concerns about thousands of gallons of fuel
[10149.00 - 10150.00] P:655.63 E:0.076978 |  on board the vessel.
[10150.00 - 10153.00] P:1622.18 E:0.074087 |  No injuries have been reported, David Barma saw the flames.
[10153.00 - 10157.00] P:1567.61 E:0.084954 |  I live over the hill from Torquay Harbour and my son
[10157.00 - 10161.00] P:1769.72 E:0.086973 |  spotted an enormous cloud of black smoke rising over the hill,
[10161.00 - 10165.00] P:1532.34 E:0.094640 |  so we went down to have a look and there was the cruiser ablaze,
[10165.00 - 10169.00] P:1905.60 E:0.082663 |  masses of smoke coming out of it, emergency services everywhere.
[10169.00 - 10173.00] P:1558.73 E:0.075067 |  An animal rights activist have been sprayed with manure by farmers
[10173.00 - 10177.00] P:1659.02 E:0.073318 |  during a protest at the UK's largest beef industry event.

[10180.00 - 10184.00] P:1591.05 E:0.070158 |  outside the Darlington Farmers' auction mart in County Durham.
[10185.00 - 10189.00] P:1335.60 E:0.114956 |  This is Five Lives Sport with Steve Crossman.
[10190.00 - 10193.00] P:1890.83 E:0.097272 |  Good evening, welcome back to Five Lives Sport,

[10206.00 - 10209.00] P:2011.51 E:0.087225 |  with a late try to win the challenge cup for a record 20th time
[10209.00 - 10212.00] P:1790.22 E:0.080697 |  they won 16-14 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

[10231.00 - 10235.00] P:1835.27 E:0.086452 |  On five live tomorrow, on Five Sports Extra right now,
[10235.00 - 10238.00] P:1886.36 E:0.079199 |  we've got coverage from the French Open just across the city.
[10238.00 - 10243.00] P:1892.60 E:0.084044 |  In Roland Garros, Egas Fjontek just made it through to the last 16,

[10248.00 - 10253.00] P:1789.98 E:0.077576 |  So, second half on the way, Alan Shearer, Chris Sutton and John Murray,
[10253.00 - 10255.00] P:1810.87 E:0.083476 |  with us inside the stadium.
[10255.00 - 10258.00] P:1885.66 E:0.081566 |  I'm looking at the two teams who are starting to get ready to come out
[10258.00 - 10260.00] P:1929.91 E:0.082352 |  of pitch in the tunnel.
[10260.00 - 10263.00] P:1992.72 E:0.089291 |  Any further views, guys, on the offside?
[10263.00 - 10267.00] P:1860.46 E:0.078722 |  Well, I've seen another couple of replays, and I'd like to see it again.
[10267.00 - 10270.00] P:1791.52 E:0.088235 |  I have to confess, and it is very difficult actually to tell,
[10270.00 - 10275.00] P:1837.02 E:0.078261 |  which is why it took so long, I think, in that as Benzema has initially played it
[10275.00 - 10277.00] P:1859.54 E:0.088202 |  and got that sort of scuffed touch on it, and it runs back,
[10277.00 - 10282.00] P:1771.84 E:0.090092 |  and Canate, a Real Madrid player, and Fabinho all converge.
[10282.00 - 10287.00] P:1822.86 E:0.070769 |  I think it might have initially been touched by Canate,
[10287.00 - 10288.00] P:1770.82 E:0.107618 |  who's trying to clear it.
[10288.00 - 10293.00] P:1702.90 E:0.095616 |  Then it clipped the Real Madrid players leg, then hit Fabinho, who was sliding in,
[10293.00 - 10297.00] P:1630.38 E:0.086712 |  and off him, rolled through to Benzema, who eventually scored it.
[10297.00 - 10302.00] P:1812.25 E:0.083053 |  I think whichever way you look at it, Liverpool, a bit fortunate there.
[10302.00 - 10306.00] P:1850.91 E:0.080431 |  Yeah, because, you know, it's a very tight interpretation of the law.
[10306.00 - 10309.00] P:1961.90 E:0.094118 |  So, if you're on the right side of it, Alan, it does come with a bit of fortune.
[10309.00 - 10313.00] P:1899.84 E:0.090306 |  Well, we're still not sure whether it actually hit the Real Madrid players
[10313.00 - 10316.00] P:1905.11 E:0.083821 |  before it actually hit Fabinho.
[10316.00 - 10320.00] P:1847.42 E:0.086033 |  I mean, the law is very unclear in terms of,
[10320.00 - 10323.00] P:1828.73 E:0.086639 |  because why are they in there anyway, the Liverpool players,
[10323.00 - 10325.00] P:1872.92 E:0.095263 |  because they're deliberately trying to clear the ball.
[10325.00 - 10329.00] P:1859.43 E:0.084226 |  Canate does try to clear the ball, but then it hits Fabinho,
[10329.00 - 10331.00] P:1845.65 E:0.081489 |  then it goes in the direction of Benzema.
[10331.00 - 10335.00] P:1755.92 E:0.075178 |  So, it's very confusing that offside law, isn't it?
[10335.00 - 10337.00] P:1891.68 E:0.091314 |  It shouldn't be, but it is.
[10337.00 - 10340.00] P:1934.89 E:0.087901 |  That's gone. The Champions League final very much hasn't.
[10340.00 - 10343.00] P:1892.22 E:0.083237 |  The second half with Alan Shearer, Chris Sutton, and John Murray.
[10343.00 - 10347.00] P:1656.36 E:0.087591 |  It's a great talking point already coming out of this Champions League final,
[10347.00 - 10351.00] P:1718.43 E:0.088054 |  which is poised at Liverpool Nail, Real Madrid Nail,
[10351.00 - 10353.00] P:1596.95 E:0.092098 |  with the second half about to begin.
[10353.00 - 10356.00] P:1708.53 E:0.084513 |  Real Madrid to kick off, no changes.
[10356.00 - 10359.00] P:1727.12 E:0.085842 |  There's the whistle from Clément Terpan,
[10359.00 - 10361.00] P:1749.92 E:0.105668 |  and Modric plays it back into his own half.
[10361.00 - 10365.00] P:1632.46 E:0.085281 |  Liverpool with Alisson, then the back four, Alexander-Arnold,
[10365.00 - 10368.00] P:1578.27 E:0.078431 |  Canate, Van Dijk and Robertson.
[10368.00 - 10372.00] P:1688.82 E:0.091138 |  Fabinho with Henderson and Thiago, who was, it looked as though he was injured
[10372.00 - 10374.00] P:1683.37 E:0.091258 |  in the warm-up, but he's okay.
[10374.00 - 10377.00] P:1513.22 E:0.080616 |  He's come out for the second half, then Salah on the right,
[10377.00 - 10380.00] P:1630.05 E:0.092822 |  Luis Diaz on the left, Sadio Mane through the middle.
[10380.00 - 10383.00] P:1684.24 E:0.095074 |  Sadio Mane forcing a very good save by Courtois,
[10383.00 - 10385.00] P:1610.74 E:0.081499 |  who's clearing now for Real Madrid.
[10385.00 - 10388.00] P:1577.69 E:0.088437 |  So, he's in goal for the record winners,
[10388.00 - 10391.00] P:1507.27 E:0.087960 |  Carvajal, Militão, Alaba and Mendi, the back four.
[10391.00 - 10394.00] P:1694.64 E:0.091563 |  Casamiro with Modric and Croce either side,
[10394.00 - 10397.00] P:1685.70 E:0.068822 |  then Valverde on the right, Venicius on the left,
[10397.00 - 10400.00] P:1660.18 E:0.073641 |  and Benzema through the middle. Alisson all in black,
[10400.00 - 10403.00] P:1736.25 E:0.080314 |  in front of all of those supporters, all in white.
[10403.00 - 10407.00] P:1728.56 E:0.084149 |  Alisson passes it forward, and Carvajal now to Benzema,
[10407.00 - 10409.00] P:1625.79 E:0.095652 |  who drags the ball back.
[10409.00 - 10415.00] P:1677.15 E:0.074191 |  Benzema, instantly recognisable with that strapping on his right wrist.
[10415.00 - 10418.00] P:1902.10 E:0.089841 |  Thought he'd scored that 45th goal of the season.
[10418.00 - 10421.00] P:1798.72 E:0.096277 |  Benzema, I'm sure, when there was such a long delay,
[10421.00 - 10428.00] P:1759.43 E:0.082242 |  but eventually the goal ruled out by VAR after a long, long procedure,
[10428.00 - 10431.00] P:1765.04 E:0.088188 |  and they did as well, look to see if there was a foul by an attack
[10431.00 - 10434.00] P:1657.39 E:0.079673 |  and clear in the build-up to putting in the net.
[10434.00 - 10436.00] P:1600.67 E:0.079380 |  So, that's why it took so long.
[10436.00 - 10440.00] P:1713.45 E:0.091145 |  Real Madrid clear, and Liverpool straight to Alexander-Arnold,
[10440.00 - 10442.00] P:1665.52 E:0.089845 |  who gives it to Salah, bounces back to Alexander-Arnold,
[10442.00 - 10446.00] P:1709.61 E:0.097808 |  who kills it into the back post, and crucial defending there.
[10446.00 - 10450.00] P:1852.99 E:0.099575 |  Luis Dias arriving, but Carvajal did so well, shoulder to shoulder,
[10450.00 - 10453.00] P:1674.19 E:0.079243 |  and it took a little glance away over to the far side.
[10453.00 - 10456.00] P:1794.27 E:0.073259 |  Tell you what, he's defended really well Carvajal in this game,
[10456.00 - 10460.00] P:1760.00 E:0.090514 |  two or three times in the first half, 1v1 with Dias and Mane,
[10460.00 - 10463.00] P:1687.86 E:0.090082 |  again there from that wonderful ball in from Trent Alexander-Arnold.
[10463.00 - 10465.00] P:1757.21 E:0.104087 |  Didn't think about it at all, whipped it in,
[10465.00 - 10468.00] P:1773.44 E:0.077356 |  but Carvajal just stopped it at the far post.
[10468.00 - 10472.00] P:1689.07 E:0.085295 |  Real Madrid coming forward, but Canate is able to cut out the intended pass
[10472.00 - 10474.00] P:1751.26 E:0.083337 |  from Benzema to Venetius,
[10474.00 - 10476.00] P:1530.60 E:0.088249 |  so Liverpool have it inside their own half,
[10476.00 - 10478.00] P:1752.77 E:0.081577 |  and Fabinho turns it to the left.
[10478.00 - 10481.00] P:1782.58 E:0.105762 |  So, I think we're all together again now on BBC Radio,
[10481.00 - 10485.00] P:1395.75 E:0.086538 |  on Five Live, on BBC Sounds, on BBC Radio Merseyside,
[10485.00 - 10487.00] P:1421.16 E:0.082789 |  and the World Service as well,
[10487.00 - 10491.00] P:1480.98 E:0.075400 |  for this latest edition of the Champions League final.
[10491.00 - 10495.00] P:1719.83 E:0.085482 |  And here's Modric now, after the ball was headed forward to him.
[10495.00 - 10499.00] P:1712.12 E:0.081632 |  Modric, long pass diagonally, down into the Liverpool right back area,
[10499.00 - 10504.00] P:1687.04 E:0.076563 |  Venetius is under this, the number 20 gives it back to Benzema,
[10504.00 - 10507.00] P:1670.91 E:0.076746 |  and then Benzema has crossed behind him.
[10507.00 - 10509.00] P:1691.57 E:0.097173 |  This is all on the left-hand side for Real Madrid,
[10509.00 - 10512.00] P:1667.93 E:0.080573 |  as they attack towards their own set of supporters,
[10512.00 - 10515.00] P:1676.82 E:0.090631 |  in the big open ball to our left-hand side,
[10515.00 - 10517.00] P:1707.58 E:0.086243 |  three tiers all the way around.
[10517.00 - 10520.00] P:1662.58 E:0.080167 |  Casemiro turns the ball forward,
[10520.00 - 10522.00] P:1417.25 E:0.073718 |  Luis Dias is back there defending,
[10522.00 - 10525.00] P:1626.83 E:0.081860 |  but Real Madrid forced to go back to the halfway line,
[10525.00 - 10532.00] P:1688.02 E:0.091898 |  and Mili Tao uses the frail-looking little figure of Luka Modric
[10532.00 - 10536.00] P:1851.08 E:0.097384 |  for his fair-hair bobbin, 36 years old now, Modric,
[10536.00 - 10538.00] P:1659.39 E:0.100027 |  and Real Madrid through him,
[10538.00 - 10542.00] P:1633.01 E:0.107169 |  and eventually through the defenders go all the way back to their Belgian goalkeeper.
[10542.00 - 10546.00] P:1540.86 E:0.100531 |  They will pull the ball onto his left foot again,
[10546.00 - 10550.00] P:1488.41 E:0.097445 |  big saves from him in the first half to keep it at 0-0.
[10550.00 - 10552.00] P:1488.82 E:0.091696 |  And then just before halftime,
[10552.00 - 10554.00] P:1467.52 E:0.070395 |  Real Madrid thought they'd got the breakthrough,
[10554.00 - 10558.00] P:1594.52 E:0.083290 |  but no, Modric now out to the far side, Calverti,
[10558.00 - 10562.00] P:1709.99 E:0.094605 |  challenged by Robertson, Valverde went down, referee plays on,
[10562.00 - 10564.00] P:1761.74 E:0.098455 |  ball over the top through the middle for Salah to chase,
[10564.00 - 10567.00] P:1645.74 E:0.091114 |  Mendi comes across him, but Salah's under the ball in the full-back position
[10567.00 - 10569.00] P:1806.41 E:0.078037 |  after it rolled across there.
[10569.00 - 10571.00] P:1724.44 E:0.096569 |  Salah now low into the penalty area,
[10571.00 - 10573.00] P:1786.22 E:0.101289 |  Mane was beaten to it by Casamiro,
[10573.00 - 10576.00] P:1735.14 E:0.097891 |  then Mane puts in the challenge, Casamiro wanted a free-kick,
[10576.00 - 10579.00] P:1730.10 E:0.093371 |  that's not given, Mane out to Lewis Diaz in the D,
[10579.00 - 10582.00] P:1837.06 E:0.081798 |  and a good challenge comes in on him actually for Real Madrid to clear,
[10582.00 - 10585.00] P:1625.53 E:0.097363 |  Mili Tao putting that in, and Real Madrid breaking away,
[10585.00 - 10588.00] P:1645.37 E:0.107147 |  and then the covering challenge this time is from Alexander-Arnold,
[10588.00 - 10591.00] P:1897.37 E:0.093906 |  who was picked up for a foul on the break,
[10591.00 - 10594.00] P:1868.97 E:0.096583 |  and Casamiro in the centre-circle, foul, Real Madrid.
[10594.00 - 10598.00] P:1960.25 E:0.097485 |  I think Casamiro went down far too easily there,
[10598.00 - 10602.00] P:1872.16 E:0.073046 |  and got the other side of Alexander-Arnold,
[10602.00 - 10606.00] P:1799.77 E:0.071155 |  and the referees let a few things go in this game,
[10606.00 - 10611.00] P:1795.63 E:0.083567 |  but Casamiro fortunate to get that award of a free-kick,
[10611.00 - 10616.00] P:1714.74 E:0.083660 |  and I think Trent Alexander-Arnold challenging the referee.
[10616.00 - 10619.00] P:1664.26 E:0.092138 |  Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 0.
[10619.00 - 10622.00] P:1618.76 E:0.097982 |  You would never have went down like that, would you, Chris?
[10622.00 - 10626.00] P:1700.40 E:0.091220 |  Well, I've been working with Chris as I have now very closely for a long time,
[10626.00 - 10630.00] P:1566.87 E:0.091014 |  Alan, I'm absolutely convinced that he never did anything like that.
[10630.00 - 10633.00] P:1720.12 E:0.082332 |  I hope you're not going to tell us different now.
[10633.00 - 10635.00] P:1650.95 E:0.100595 |  I was better than that, John.
[10635.00 - 10638.00] P:1794.02 E:0.091069 |  I'll tell you over of point later, John.
[10638.00 - 10640.00] P:1524.09 E:0.077442 |  Looking forward to that.
[10640.00 - 10644.00] P:1690.58 E:0.083088 |  Here's Casamiro back towards Madrid.
[10644.00 - 10647.00] P:1593.50 E:0.087944 |  The point would be, Chris, that you're now better than that.
[10647.00 - 10651.00] P:1642.72 E:0.087036 |  Yes, Casamiro heading it back to the half-way line,
[10651.00 - 10653.00] P:1432.39 E:0.075929 |  and then over the top from Alaba,
[10653.00 - 10659.00] P:1643.40 E:0.082424 |  but he's put too much on that, and Alasen has got the ball safely on the edge of the penalty area.
[10659.00 - 10662.00] P:1733.82 E:0.089753 |  It's a big final, it's a big occasion, so much surrounding it.
[10662.00 - 10667.00] P:1610.99 E:0.088179 |  You know, the players cannot be immune to what's been going on off the field.
[10667.00 - 10670.00] P:1685.70 E:0.079426 |  There's a nervous energy involved in all of that as well.
[10670.00 - 10676.00] P:1592.52 E:0.074634 |  They have heard, I'm sure, that Manet tries to get the bouncing ball down,
[10676.00 - 10679.00] P:1782.87 E:0.090337 |  and then back it goes into the Real Madrid half.
[10679.00 - 10683.00] P:1784.30 E:0.081561 |  We expected goals, didn't we? We expected thrills and spills,
[10683.00 - 10686.00] P:1700.15 E:0.083928 |  but the longer it goes on a night like this,
[10686.00 - 10692.00] P:1560.95 E:0.078040 |  even these teams would introduce a little element of caution, wouldn't they, or would they?
[10692.00 - 10697.00] P:1702.28 E:0.093837 |  Well, you know, we've talked before about the strength of Liverpool's bench.
[10697.00 - 10703.00] P:1647.66 E:0.096114 |  When we go back to 2018 and the final, Liverpool didn't have a lot on the bench.
[10703.00 - 10707.00] P:1708.93 E:0.091773 |  The bench was bare this evening.
[10707.00 - 10711.00] P:1593.77 E:0.093042 |  Jurgen Klopp, I think, has decent options to put on.
[10711.00 - 10713.00] P:1427.98 E:0.078015 |  Yes, he has lots of options.
[10713.00 - 10716.00] P:1583.67 E:0.095794 |  No Divock Origi, though, sadly, with the injury that he has,
[10716.00 - 10719.00] P:1473.68 E:0.084110 |  so he's not going to be able to play that role tonight.
[10719.00 - 10721.00] P:1480.06 E:0.078274 |  Probably the end of his, well, it will be wanted.
[10721.00 - 10723.00] P:1387.89 E:0.089533 |  He is leaving at the end of the season.
[10723.00 - 10728.00] P:1564.07 E:0.090290 |  He's had to miss out, but many of Liverpool's stars have made it through the injury worries.
[10728.00 - 10730.00] P:1626.47 E:0.091049 |  Van Dijk, he was one of them.
[10730.00 - 10732.00] P:1718.11 E:0.092552 |  Canate now at the back. Canate, very confident.
[10732.00 - 10735.00] P:1807.22 E:0.091844 |  Playing the ball out towards the left-hand side to Fabinho.
[10735.00 - 10737.00] P:1506.11 E:0.079927 |  And then Luis Diaz.
[10737.00 - 10741.00] P:1382.52 E:0.098273 |  If you weren't listening to the first half, there was a spell where Liverpool were really in their stride.
[10741.00 - 10744.00] P:1632.10 E:0.084339 |  Real Madrid came back into it in the latter stages of the first half,
[10744.00 - 10746.00] P:1677.26 E:0.092588 |  and as I say, thought they'd scored the goal.
[10746.00 - 10748.00] P:1648.57 E:0.096518 |  Here's Salah now down the right, chips it into the back post,
[10748.00 - 10753.00] P:1755.76 E:0.078409 |  but Coutreau was able to come in and meet it and catch it outside the six-yard box,
[10753.00 - 10755.00] P:1437.13 E:0.075113 |  and it never got to the far post.
[10755.00 - 10760.00] P:1639.45 E:0.086155 |  And now Casamiro using Valverde, although they're on the right-hand side.
[10760.00 - 10763.00] P:1635.14 E:0.088128 |  Casamiro will just lift it forward beyond Robertson.
[10763.00 - 10766.00] P:1802.47 E:0.097622 |  Valverde trying to get there past Robertson, their shoulder to shoulder.
[10766.00 - 10769.00] P:1774.55 E:0.092503 |  Valverde's been able to keep possession, played in field.
[10769.00 - 10772.00] P:1578.67 E:0.080357 |  Benzema then gives it back towards the right-hand side,
[10772.00 - 10776.00] P:1613.97 E:0.088164 |  where Carvajal, a fallen Carvajal, is able to quickly get to his feet.
[10776.00 - 10778.00] P:1713.42 E:0.095595 |  Liverpool have two men in on him.
[10778.00 - 10782.00] P:1675.30 E:0.102765 |  Luis Diaz is back there as well, and the ball comes out for Liverpool.
[10782.00 - 10787.00] P:1887.19 E:0.098259 |  Big cheers from the Liverpool fans occupying this stand to our right.
[10787.00 - 10791.00] P:1822.50 E:0.075188 |  Carvajal unhappy with the challenge.
[10791.00 - 10793.00] P:1538.98 E:0.103164 |  Appealing to the referee.
[10793.00 - 10795.00] P:1635.86 E:0.070826 |  Nothing given there.
[10795.00 - 10799.00] P:1841.99 E:0.077930 |  We talked about the Liverpool subs, but look at the Real Madrid bench.
[10799.00 - 10804.00] P:1863.97 E:0.090757 |  Rodrigo, Valverde has done a right down that right-hand side,
[10804.00 - 10806.00] P:1818.87 E:0.078648 |  but Rodrigo the danger man.
[10806.00 - 10811.00] P:1693.16 E:0.079196 |  Yeah, Rodrigo is able to make a contribution from the bench, I think.
[10811.00 - 10815.00] P:1419.61 E:0.087813 |  Here's Real Madrid with it on the halfway line.
[10815.00 - 10820.00] P:1601.93 E:0.086050 |  Casamiro not forgetting the exciting young Camavinga as well,
[10820.00 - 10824.00] P:1485.16 E:0.086034 |  who's there as well, who really helped to change things, didn't he?
[10824.00 - 10827.00] P:1260.28 E:0.081784 |  And that second leg in the Burnabout against Manchester City.
[10827.00 - 10830.00] P:1715.21 E:0.101692 |  Back it goes to the edge of the box, van Dijk just passes it.
[10830.00 - 10833.00] P:1667.65 E:0.101085 |  So simply, Tamané, who then drives the ball low,
[10833.00 - 10836.00] P:1806.56 E:0.092760 |  which curls out towards the left-hand side.
[10836.00 - 10840.00] P:1760.65 E:0.069106 |  Diaz now, Diaz against Modric, plays it.
[10840.00 - 10843.00] P:1709.09 E:0.093995 |  Tamané on the edge of the box, who shot his block at source.
[10843.00 - 10846.00] P:1748.70 E:0.094561 |  Van Cistar, Alexander-Arnold, who shot his block as well,
[10846.00 - 10848.00] P:1778.67 E:0.095626 |  quickly closed down. Alexander-Arnold though,
[10848.00 - 10851.00] P:1844.29 E:0.105205 |  was determined to get there first, and he did ahead of Casamiro,
[10851.00 - 10853.00] P:1785.55 E:0.091454 |  who claims he was foul.
[10853.00 - 10855.00] P:1638.70 E:0.100357 |  Referee Tapané is having none of that one now.
[10855.00 - 10859.00] P:1589.11 E:0.085265 |  Now, Sario Mané just outside the area, squared Alexander-Arnold,
[10859.00 - 10862.00] P:1598.39 E:0.091680 |  30 yards out, Real Madrid parked behind the ball.
[10862.00 - 10865.00] P:1674.49 E:0.093234 |  In fact, Benzema now comes back as well and starts doing the hard work.
[10865.00 - 10870.00] P:1782.03 E:0.085328 |  Liverpool did it on the left-hand side, still nil-nil in the final here.
[10870.00 - 10877.00] P:1901.73 E:0.065292 |  And Thiago caresses a pass to his right, to Fabinho.
[10877.00 - 10882.00] P:1866.58 E:0.084419 |  And now Thiago again goes for one of his more ambitious passes.
[10882.00 - 10884.00] P:1623.91 E:0.095255 |  High to the feet of Alexander-Arnold.
[10884.00 - 10887.00] P:1585.81 E:0.094705 |  Infield to Henderson, Henderson then uses Alexander-Arnold
[10887.00 - 10889.00] P:1702.67 E:0.102207 |  in the full-back position, the ball across.
[10889.00 - 10892.00] P:1821.89 E:0.077802 |  Cuatro comes, gets a punch on it, full-length dive.
[10892.00 - 10894.00] P:1657.27 E:0.087629 |  Liverpool force it back over the top,
[10894.00 - 10897.00] P:1745.42 E:0.075791 |  but it will bounce through for a goal kick, and it's still nil-nil.
[10897.00 - 10898.00] P:1756.18 E:0.108054 |  Alan Shearer.
[10898.00 - 10901.00] P:1905.12 E:0.094447 |  Again, Trent-Alexander, right-Arnold down the right-hand side.
[10901.00 - 10904.00] P:1857.65 E:0.084638 |  He actually looks up and sees Thiago attacking that near post there,
[10904.00 - 10908.00] P:1716.34 E:0.087461 |  and he's just about a foot off it, isn't he, when he whips that ball in.
[10908.00 - 10911.00] P:1784.98 E:0.084760 |  He just can't get that vital touch at the near post.
[10911.00 - 10916.00] P:1639.33 E:0.076567 |  And then now Cuatro has to punch that away.
[10916.00 - 10920.00] P:1521.26 E:0.082771 |  There is a cooler breeze now, just swirling around.
[10920.00 - 10925.00] P:1805.62 E:0.082823 |  The Stout de France on this dry night in Real Madrid with the ball at the back.
[10925.00 - 10928.00] P:1725.80 E:0.089044 |  Millet-Towards dragging it back onto his right foot.
[10928.00 - 10931.00] P:1854.12 E:0.112283 |  He's under pressure, and he's chipped it straight out of play.
[10931.00 - 10933.00] P:1678.98 E:0.088062 |  And Liverpool take a quick throw.
[10933.00 - 10938.00] P:1825.29 E:0.091059 |  Liverpool with Luis Díaz, who is challenged.
[10938.00 - 10942.00] P:1775.89 E:0.103706 |  The Real Madrid player has gone down over there.
[10942.00 - 10944.00] P:1743.13 E:0.100598 |  Who is it who's gone down?
[10944.00 - 10946.00] P:1833.58 E:0.090765 |  That's ridiculous, Mr. John.
[10946.00 - 10951.00] P:1854.59 E:0.092480 |  It really is, because Millet-Towards playing a game of rugby there,
[10951.00 - 10954.00] P:1835.28 E:0.081887 |  I think on Luis Díaz, and brought him down.
[10954.00 - 10958.00] P:1846.27 E:0.088933 |  I do think that Díaz caught Millet-Towards in the head with his boot,
[10958.00 - 10962.00] P:1837.03 E:0.054742 |  but the first foul...
[10962.00 - 10967.00] P:1796.13 E:0.083502 |  ...was from Millet-Towards, and the free kick goes the other way.
[10967.00 - 10972.00] P:1816.97 E:0.100591 |  He was still down-lying on his back, the central defender.
[10972.00 - 10976.00] P:1938.35 E:0.105445 |  And he was, it was a grappling job, wasn't it, between the two of them?
[10976.00 - 10981.00] P:1774.11 E:0.088068 |  And Luis Díaz fell on his head and his upper body.
[10981.00 - 10984.00] P:1610.25 E:0.077056 |  It was never a foul like that.
[10984.00 - 10986.00] P:1679.07 E:0.107363 |  Díaz was so strong, wasn't he?
[10986.00 - 10991.00] P:1650.85 E:0.105103 |  So nudged him off the ball, they both went together, both shoulder to shoulder.
[10992.00 - 10996.00] P:1649.43 E:0.105591 |  Yeah, he's got a wiry strength, hasn't he?
[10996.00 - 11000.00] P:1523.30 E:0.107614 |  Luis Díaz used to be known as Fideo when he was growing up, noodles.
[11000.00 - 11006.00] P:1371.27 E:0.102028 |  Because his legs were like noodles, he was so thin, but he's not like that anymore.
[11006.00 - 11010.00] P:1462.04 E:0.106392 |  That was one of our facts of the day on 5-5 during the course of the season.
[11010.00 - 11013.00] P:1457.20 E:0.113136 |  It was one of Tony Lipsy's facts of the day yesterday.
[11013.00 - 11016.00] P:1623.30 E:0.112549 |  He was telling us all about the slope on the pitch at Colm Dynamo,
[11016.00 - 11019.00] P:1580.18 E:0.105646 |  where Alan Kennedy once used to play.
[11019.00 - 11021.00] P:1597.35 E:0.106307 |  About 15 feet, was it?
[11021.00 - 11023.00] P:1459.31 E:0.106473 |  It was 15 feet.
[11023.00 - 11030.00] P:1590.78 E:0.105794 |  Alan Kennedy, who scored that winning goal for Liverpool in the 1981 final against Real Madrid.
[11030.00 - 11034.00] P:1463.89 E:0.098964 |  The left back, it's got the feel, the longer this game's on,
[11034.00 - 11041.00] P:1416.89 E:0.097265 |  then it could be an unlikely hero, maybe, who is going to provide the winning moment in this final.
[11041.00 - 11043.00] P:1401.81 E:0.093481 |  Nil Nil.
[11043.00 - 11048.00] P:1512.96 E:0.106742 |  He's OK, Militao, he's back on the field, Koutracek, the free-kick-down field.
[11048.00 - 11051.00] P:1429.78 E:0.088988 |  And then offside flag up against Real Madrid.
[11051.00 - 11054.00] P:1350.34 E:0.093438 |  So Van Dijk quickly catches the ball.
[11054.00 - 11058.00] P:1341.71 E:0.094716 |  Great noise from the Liverpool fans, singing all of their favourite songs.
[11058.00 - 11062.00] P:1494.85 E:0.091400 |  And he has Henderson on the half-way line through to Mané,
[11062.00 - 11066.00] P:1696.25 E:0.088256 |  but important interception, sliding interception from Casamiro.
[11066.00 - 11072.00] P:1554.39 E:0.088188 |  You see in this game how important he is for this Real Madrid team, Casamiro, the number 14.
[11072.00 - 11076.00] P:1764.91 E:0.102878 |  And now Fabinho, Nassan de Serco, fulfills the same sort of role for Liverpool,
[11076.00 - 11080.00] P:1643.10 E:0.083914 |  but towards Sadio Mané, forward of the centre-circle,
[11080.00 - 11084.00] P:1741.02 E:0.094231 |  Sadio Mané, denied by Koutracek in the first half, Henderson and Salah.
[11084.00 - 11090.00] P:1713.18 E:0.100620 |  Salah now back to Alexander-Arnold, ball into the area of the Salah, controls the shoots, it's blocked, bounces back,
[11090.00 - 11092.00] P:1717.10 E:0.103096 |  shoots for Hanball in there.
[11092.00 - 11098.00] P:1784.61 E:0.094546 |  The Liverpool fans understand they're joining in, but referee Turpan Luchs distinctly unmoved.
[11098.00 - 11103.00] P:1810.34 E:0.088816 |  Didn't look Hanball for where I was, it's the vicinity, isn't it?
[11103.00 - 11108.00] P:1730.20 E:0.100781 |  He's about a yard or two away and I don't think his arms are high, the defenders might have hit his knee
[11108.00 - 11114.00] P:1719.26 E:0.096349 |  actually before it goes on to his hand or his arm, so no penalty, correct decision.
[11114.00 - 11119.00] P:1661.05 E:0.106390 |  It's Alaba, he comes off his thigh onto his hand, his hand by his side.
[11119.00 - 11125.00] P:1637.48 E:0.102471 |  Cleverly worked though from Liverpool, Salah passing the ball to Alexander-Arnold, following the run.
[11125.00 - 11129.00] P:1622.94 E:0.096840 |  And didn't get his first shot off, but did the second one.
[11129.00 - 11132.00] P:1628.23 E:0.102800 |  So still Liverpool, Nail, Real Madrid, Nail.
[11132.00 - 11137.00] P:1595.94 E:0.095986 |  Chris Sutton will be with Robbie Savage later, Robbie's back home. Chris is here with us in the Stade de France,
[11137.00 - 11145.00] P:1737.62 E:0.093056 |  you'll be taking calls on 08, 08, 05, 9, 09, 6, 9, 3 and lots to talk about, off-field as well as on-field.
[11145.00 - 11151.00] P:1847.56 E:0.106673 |  He has Valverde for Real Madrid to the edge of the area and into the box and shoots across, it's there!
[11151.00 - 11161.00] P:1772.50 E:0.111785 |  Finish has arrived at the back post, sliding in in the six yard box and Real Madrid score first in the Stade de France.
[11161.00 - 11171.00] P:1692.18 E:0.105977 |  In the Champions League final against Liverpool, 1-0 Carlo Ancelotti side-lead, you wouldn't know it to look at him.
[11171.00 - 11177.00] P:1687.78 E:0.105161 |  He looks as calm as can be for the Real Madrid, players and supporters.
[11177.00 - 11182.00] P:1606.48 E:0.100024 |  A joyous Liverpool Nail Real Madrid one.
[11182.00 - 11190.00] P:1566.16 E:0.109489 |  I'm not sure, I think this is a shot actually and Benizius at the back post doing what a good forward's through.
[11190.00 - 11200.00] P:1590.96 E:0.100525 |  Is he onside? I think he is just onside. Trent Alexander-Arnold's right foot plays him onside, I think,
[11200.00 - 11206.00] P:1749.04 E:0.092609 |  he'll be checking it of course but drifts him behind him, Alexander-Arnold switches off.
[11206.00 - 11209.00] P:1648.93 E:0.100494 |  I think it's a shot Alan, don't you, Valverde?
[11209.00 - 11215.00] P:1808.12 E:0.100292 |  It is but it's a shot where you're taught isn't it, if you're going to go for the far post then just miss it at that far post
[11215.00 - 11222.00] P:1732.62 E:0.101609 |  because someone else might be running in and that's exactly what the case is, Benizius reads it very very well indeed
[11222.00 - 11228.00] P:1677.81 E:0.101113 |  and Trent Alexander-Arnold gets caught out, we said about that battle, we've mentioned his defending
[11228.00 - 11235.00] P:1665.37 E:0.101776 |  but he does get caught out there, he goes to sleep for that second, he doesn't realise that Benizius is actually in behind him
[11235.00 - 11238.00] P:1562.29 E:0.098317 |  and gets punished.
[11238.00 - 11247.00] P:1632.41 E:0.103289 |  So it is the 21 year old, Benizius who scores the opening goal of the 2022 Champions League final,
[11247.00 - 11255.00] P:1648.01 E:0.095938 |  Benizius who scored twice against Liverpool in this competition last season when Real Madrid knocked Liverpool out in the quarterfinals
[11255.00 - 11267.00] P:1675.11 E:0.089099 |  and there it is, it is Real Madrid who have struck first and that's the noise coming out of their end, all of the smoke from the flares.
[11267.00 - 11278.00] P:1600.29 E:0.094890 |  Real Madrid now looking at potentially a record 14th European Cup stroke Champions League victory.
[11278.00 - 11286.00] P:1614.23 E:0.104784 |  Fabinho comes across and deflects the ball out of play off Benzema and it's a throwing to Liverpool who had their chances in the first half,
[11286.00 - 11291.00] P:1585.06 E:0.100634 |  weren't able to find a way past Couretois and now have got to come from behind.
[11291.00 - 11296.00] P:1665.44 E:0.099891 |  I haven't seen the stats but I can't remember Real Madrid having an effort on target,
[11296.00 - 11301.00] P:1632.71 E:0.098840 |  with that 60 minutes we've been going and I think that's their first effort on target.
[11301.00 - 11308.00] P:1508.63 E:0.101062 |  Yeah I think that's right Alan, there were a couple of moments obviously had the ball in the net, the VAR ruled that out
[11308.00 - 11316.00] P:1740.36 E:0.099508 |  but this goal stands and Fabinho has bundled over on the half way line and that was quite cynical from the man who just scored the goal, Benizius.
[11316.00 - 11322.00] P:1733.85 E:0.095650 |  Liverpool players, a few of them waving their arms in the air saying how is that not the yellow card?
[11322.00 - 11326.00] P:1918.67 E:0.089285 |  Mentality monsters Liverpool, John.
[11326.00 - 11336.00] P:1771.93 E:0.086271 |  Yeah well they've been behind in five of their last six matches now but remained unbeaten throughout that run.
[11336.00 - 11345.00] P:1677.78 E:0.091512 |  Indeed of course Liverpool have not yet lost a match but here they come forward now, Real Madrid breaking again,
[11345.00 - 11353.00] P:1794.04 E:0.108858 |  dangerously and across comes Fabinho putting the challenge and that is a yellow card and Liverpool are unhappy about that.
[11353.00 - 11358.00] P:1749.90 E:0.091245 |  Fabinho walks away with his hands on his hips, that's the first yellow of the match for Fabinho.
[11358.00 - 11364.00] P:1655.60 E:0.092297 |  It was the right decision, I think it was, he was certainly late in the challenge, he caught him.
[11364.00 - 11374.00] P:1488.48 E:0.097408 |  No doubt about that, Valverde who was so involved in that goal just a couple of minutes earlier, that's a foul on the yellow card.
[11374.00 - 11388.00] P:1474.96 E:0.095885 |  Things have taken a turn against Liverpool here, Liverpool who have lost just one of their last 34 matches but have got to come from behind in this match.
[11388.00 - 11396.00] P:1650.98 E:0.100770 |  I think it was a fantastic ball across, whether it was a shot or across that's what you have to do, if you're going to miss it you make sure you miss it at that side.
[11396.00 - 11403.00] P:1540.17 E:0.086286 |  Real Madrid come again now, Liverpool though they're able to clear, van Dijk was in in the right place to cut that out,
[11403.00 - 11413.00] P:1677.85 E:0.088640 |  goal is played in field by Mané Ver Kroos who's under that and suddenly Real Madrid have an extra half yard it seems now having scored the opening goal.
[11413.00 - 11424.00] P:1588.89 E:0.086509 |  Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 1 on BBC Radio, here is Modric on the right hand side, Modric turns and plays it back and gets the puck it out of play,
[11424.00 - 11430.00] P:1742.41 E:0.096464 |  of Lewis Diaz, the right crystal mentality, monsters have got a battle on their hands here.
[11430.00 - 11439.00] P:1729.85 E:0.093073 |  They have, they've just got to regroup a little bit, recovered from the goal, it's Real Madrid strutting their stuff.
[11440.00 - 11443.00] P:1634.23 E:0.103144 |  Jota's about to come on, he's strict.
[11443.00 - 11451.00] P:1557.13 E:0.101725 |  Courtois downfield, questions going to be who is he going to replace, as Henderson heads the ball back to his goalkeeper, Alisson in the goal to our left.
[11451.00 - 11453.00] P:1593.16 E:0.096602 |  What do you think?
[11453.00 - 11457.00] P:1566.92 E:0.099985 |  Oh, that's quite a tough call that isn't it?
[11457.00 - 11462.00] P:1682.82 E:0.105964 |  I think it was Lewis Diaz as the one that really hasn't had any change out of Carvajal tonight.
[11463.00 - 11471.00] P:1756.53 E:0.097446 |  Look, other house played really well, here's Salah now cutting in from the right left foot, shot Courtois across to Dive and he keeps it out.
[11471.00 - 11479.00] P:1771.49 E:0.091567 |  I think he had a good sight on that, but leaping to his right, the 6 foot 7 Belgium got a very good hand to it to push it away.
[11479.00 - 11489.00] P:1745.24 E:0.091017 |  6 foot 7 but Adjial as well, how many times have we seen Mo Salah score from that position, driving in and his favourite left foot went 22 yards out.
[11489.00 - 11493.00] P:1739.54 E:0.082684 |  Trying to bend it with pace into that far corner, terrific save.
[11493.00 - 11504.00] P:1641.14 E:0.091116 |  And it's another Courtois save, he's keeping a clean sheet. Liverpool won't here in the Stade de France tonight, having seen Venetius slide in to score.
[11504.00 - 11509.00] P:1480.80 E:0.092888 |  What is his 22nd goal of his best goal scoring season yet?
[11509.00 - 11512.00] P:1599.07 E:0.095985 |  Here's Fabinho playing the ball out to the right hand side.
[11512.00 - 11520.00] P:1703.33 E:0.097631 |  The big men have to stand up for Liverpool now and here's one of them, Salah who drags the ball back and is fouled by Venetius and it's a free kick.
[11520.00 - 11532.00] P:1771.27 E:0.088352 |  And Venetius puts his hands on his hips and looks at the crowd, it's like something off the stage the way that he put his hand on his hip and looked at the crowd, but it is a free kick to Liverpool.
[11532.00 - 11541.00] P:1838.84 E:0.091216 |  The surprising thing was the assistant 10 yards away, didn't wave his flag, and it's the substitution, it is Diaz.
[11542.00 - 11546.00] P:1886.91 E:0.100160 |  I've called it right Alan, Luis Diaz.
[11546.00 - 11558.00] P:1773.29 E:0.100224 |  You saw more Salah in the first half have that effort in goal, Sadio Mane was very clever once or twice, had that great effort, that Courtois saved and not too much has come down that side from Diaz this evening.
[11558.00 - 11570.00] P:1467.25 E:0.091519 |  So off he goes, the recent signing and Diogo Giotta comes on who's not scored since the 2-2 game against Manchester City.
[11570.00 - 11574.00] P:1486.03 E:0.093931 |  Diogo Giotta, free kick for Liverpool from the right hand side, then the...
[11574.00 - 11579.00] P:1595.92 E:0.082014 |  So effective with this sort of free kick from this sort of position so often.
[11579.00 - 11584.00] P:1610.73 E:0.080948 |  Robertson will take it left, put it in looking for a little glance but it was headed away.
[11584.00 - 11590.00] P:1729.15 E:0.088764 |  It was Valverde who got there, it was for Real Madrid, headed back for Mane on the left hand side.
[11590.00 - 11599.00] P:1673.38 E:0.087471 |  Mane with Carvajalas quickly across, right foot across from Mane, Canate was after it, Millitow was up to head that away, Liverpool take up possession again.
[11599.00 - 11606.00] P:1809.68 E:0.091494 |  Real Madrid are winning 1-0, that second half goal, ball headed back to goalkeeper Courtois, who's able to make the catch.
[11606.00 - 11613.00] P:1778.88 E:0.084388 |  Terrific header from Militaro, hasn't had the best of seasons, taking a fair bit of criticism as you see the Courtois.
[11614.00 - 11619.00] P:1690.33 E:0.085696 |  Save again but as that ball went into the box, that's a really dominant...
[11621.00 - 11629.00] P:1651.29 E:0.089414 |  So Real Madrid leading through that, Venetius goal which I think was 58th minute, 59th minute, I just see it coming up in front of us.
[11629.00 - 11637.00] P:1618.32 E:0.094565 |  He has Venetius now on the half way line, in comes the challenge from Salah, and bounces to Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool with Mane,
[11637.00 - 11641.00] P:1716.40 E:0.085733 |  just holds off the challenge that comes in, just brushed off Venetius.
[11641.00 - 11650.00] P:1812.80 E:0.100826 |  And now Salah down the right hand side but he's fouled close, it was given by the assistant, and it's a free kick to Real Madrid in their left back position.
[11650.00 - 11662.00] P:1707.77 E:0.087678 |  So Real Madrid in this competition in the knockout stages have come from behind, time and time again, they've looked down and out several times over against Paris Saint-Germain,
[11662.00 - 11668.00] P:1744.07 E:0.098102 |  and against Chelsea when Chelsea came back against them, and then of course against Manchester City.
[11669.00 - 11679.00] P:1553.34 E:0.095601 |  But now it's Liverpool who've got to come back against Real Madrid, and time is beginning to run out, just over a quarter of the match to go, for 90 minutes.
[11679.00 - 11688.00] P:1569.57 E:0.091629 |  Liverpool headed forward towards the half way line, Mane, Casemiro's appealing for a free kick, then the ball's played forward, Jota might be involved for the first time,
[11688.00 - 11696.00] P:1856.60 E:0.104676 |  for Liverpool that there's a clear shove in the back. The ball bounces through, it looks like a shove, it looks like a shove by Jota,
[11696.00 - 11700.00] P:1778.40 E:0.085955 |  but referee Turban says no, corner Liverpool from the left.
[11700.00 - 11709.00] P:1621.19 E:0.095907 |  Not fell for any of the referee, he's done reasonably well in when it's been those decisions, when players have tried to corner him out of a free kick.
[11709.00 - 11716.00] P:1592.07 E:0.094935 |  And the corner, it's been a big threat from set pieces, with the recent goals that he scored. Here is the delivery from the Liverpool corner,
[11716.00 - 11725.00] P:1678.00 E:0.088735 |  but it's poor, doesn't meet Carvajal at the near post, Carvajal heads it away, Thiago stretches in, and now it's played forward again, Jota is there,
[11725.00 - 11733.00] P:1739.89 E:0.101141 |  he plays the ball and wins another corner, and that's a big support coming from the stands down that end of the ground from the Liverpool fans, corner Liverpool.
[11733.00 - 11744.00] P:1556.72 E:0.097662 |  The delivery has to be better from Andy Robertson, the first man, Carvajal is in that near post space, he's got to get it over him.
[11744.00 - 11754.00] P:1735.04 E:0.085114 |  Well he has, and Canate tries to get there, good defending though, he's blocked, still in the area though, and then it's folly'd away to compare it with safety.
[11754.00 - 11761.00] P:1679.61 E:0.099961 |  It's actually Alexander Arnett who puts in the challenge, and then Henderson chips it forward to Salah in the box on the right hand side, Salah back to Henderson,
[11761.00 - 11769.00] P:1709.99 E:0.098942 |  first time cross from him to the back post, it's headed across, Salah could be there, but Courtois was able to slide in and do enough to put Salah off,
[11769.00 - 11772.00] P:1736.18 E:0.101408 |  and Courtois to the rescue once again for Real Madrid.
[11772.00 - 11780.00] P:1745.33 E:0.098681 |  He's been brilliant tonight Courtois, he's been bright, he's been alert, he's been first to everything, as he was there again when that ball comes in,
[11780.00 - 11785.00] P:1752.69 E:0.101911 |  it's a loop, headed back across the goal isn't it, from Jotter at the far post, but he reads it well.
[11785.00 - 11791.00] P:1651.60 E:0.098872 |  He is Valverde now, downfield doing well, gets the ball over, but Canate was able to get up and head it down.
[11791.00 - 11799.00] P:1795.65 E:0.092393 |  The other thing about Courtois there was, for a big man, he was exceptionally quick across his six yard box.
[11799.00 - 11806.00] P:1733.62 E:0.090975 |  He just gambled in the end, didn't he, looping head up back across, and Salah would have tapped it into an empty net.
[11806.00 - 11808.00] P:1584.05 E:0.085072 |  That's about the third or fourth big save.
[11808.00 - 11814.00] P:1590.30 E:0.094560 |  20 minutes to go, Salah trying to find a way through, but this time it's Alaba who is there on the edge of the penalty area,
[11814.00 - 11823.00] P:1711.07 E:0.090470 |  Champions League winner with Bayern Munich, just like Thiago on the opposite side, winner with Bayern Munich two years ago.
[11823.00 - 11834.00] P:1783.55 E:0.096427 |  This is going the way of Real Madrid, there are now 20 minutes left to play, 1-0, the record winners, Real Madrid, the Spanish champions once again,
[11834.00 - 11842.00] P:1747.61 E:0.096666 |  the kings of Europe, but Alexander-Arnold with a cross bit, he's got too much on that, Grunz from the Liverpool supporters.
[11842.00 - 11848.00] P:1724.23 E:0.098926 |  That's a real blow to Moral, saying Alexander-Arnold putting a ball in like that, goal kick.
[11848.00 - 11855.00] P:1731.12 E:0.105906 |  But also Liverpool have to be really careful in terms of their pushing forward now, it was just about a minute ago when they lost that ball
[11855.00 - 11861.00] P:1652.88 E:0.097352 |  Real Madrid got it, if they had it looked up to the right hand side, it would have seemed that Benzema was through,
[11861.00 - 11869.00] P:1656.35 E:0.096319 |  but no one could actually spot them and play that pass, and that's going to happen more and more the way Liverpool are trying to push forward and get that goal back.
[11869.00 - 11877.00] P:1565.37 E:0.096881 |  Just seeing that Courtois save again, it's a brilliant piece of goalkeeping, it really is the Jota looping header.
[11877.00 - 11884.00] P:1657.84 E:0.087574 |  You're right, really nimble there Courtois, dancing feet, gets across and crucial save.
[11884.00 - 11892.00] P:1702.95 E:0.084727 |  He runs away from Alexander-Arnold, Real Madrid have got it back, yeah, Benzema, Alan, you can almost see him licking his lips, can't you?
[11892.00 - 11900.00] P:1625.10 E:0.097139 |  Benzema waiting for that chance that, you know, his instinct will tell him, my near welcome in this scenario.
[11900.00 - 11908.00] P:1824.41 E:0.103507 |  Modric playing it forward, going now to Venicius, Venicius running at Canate, under his right foot, good recovery from Canate.
[11908.00 - 11915.00] P:1709.35 E:0.102526 |  Just when it looked as though Venicius in the D was going to shoot goal with Canate with an amazing recovery really.
[11915.00 - 11923.00] P:1781.80 E:0.088963 |  What a pick out as well from Luca Modric to find Venicius, timely challenge from Canate.
[11923.00 - 11931.00] P:1835.47 E:0.093557 |  Yeah, Modric, what Liverpool do not want is Luca Modric's influence on this game suddenly to increase.
[11931.00 - 11935.00] P:1637.88 E:0.090496 |  They've defended really well you know Real Madrid this second half.
[11935.00 - 11940.00] P:1611.13 E:0.094539 |  Throw in taken for Liverpool, Fabinho into the edge of the area, that's a strong challenge as well on Jota.
[11940.00 - 11948.00] P:1757.30 E:0.098050 |  He held off Militao but the goal bounces from Modric, Modric again dancing in and then Van Dyke comes in with a heavy challenge.
[11948.00 - 11957.00] P:1735.91 E:0.088134 |  In the back of Benzema he hauls to his feet, free kick to Real Madrid half way inside the run half and of course now all teams do it.
[11957.00 - 11962.00] P:1520.40 E:0.093005 |  Real Madrid as they say, Chris, managing the game.
[11962.00 - 11973.00] P:1681.99 E:0.102639 |  Yeah, well what they are, I mean you look at the mid-thrialed three, Modric, Tony Proust and Casimir Oaks,
[11973.00 - 11977.00] P:1576.17 E:0.101878 |  street wise as they come dictate the tempo of the game.
[11977.00 - 11985.00] P:1571.25 E:0.097831 |  Free kick taken, long downfield Venicius almost onto that, Alison Salamiere was able to come and catch the bouncing ball.
[11985.00 - 11992.00] P:1612.82 E:0.079367 |  I tell you what, Trent Alexander-Arnold switched off there didn't he?
[11992.00 - 11998.00] P:1586.19 E:0.090459 |  Alison, good sweep, the keeper that he is, had to get that right.
[11998.00 - 12004.00] P:1667.08 E:0.087175 |  72 minutes on the clock, Liverpool nail Real Madrid one.
[12004.00 - 12012.00] P:1645.09 E:0.089205 |  With this scoreline it's shaping up to be Real Madrid's night in this great competition once again.
[12012.00 - 12017.00] P:1418.50 E:0.091191 |  They've won their last second Champions League finals.
[12017.00 - 12025.00] P:1490.07 E:0.097150 |  Not since Liverpool won that Alan Kennedy goal that we were talking about, that's the last time Real Madrid lost a Champions League final.
[12025.00 - 12034.00] P:1687.02 E:0.099843 |  Here's Canate, Canate to the right hand side and there Alexander-Arnold allows the ball and roll and Mendy puts in the challenge.
[12034.00 - 12041.00] P:1757.28 E:0.100464 |  The ball out of play, Venicius wasn't very happy about Alexander-Arnold's initial challenge there and just puts his body into it.
[12041.00 - 12050.00] P:1772.35 E:0.087796 |  Just trying to ruffle the Liverpool body language and momentum.
[12050.00 - 12054.00] P:1675.57 E:0.098210 |  Looks like Keita is coming on, that's not a surprise for that injury to Thiago.
[12054.00 - 12060.00] P:1728.75 E:0.088856 |  Liverpool take the quick throw, it's been worked away by Cross, Henderson beaten in the air, that doesn't reach Benzema,
[12060.00 - 12068.00] P:1725.81 E:0.098776 |  Mendy was able to hook it back over towards the edge of the Real Madrid penalty area and then forward to Jota, Jota peels away from Carvajal.
[12068.00 - 12073.00] P:1716.81 E:0.091599 |  Jota to the edge of the area into the box but then Casamiro, super challenge, timed it brilliantly.
[12073.00 - 12080.00] P:1663.81 E:0.095961 |  Liverpool come again though, Henderson now to Alexander-Arnold, Alexander-Arnold, no ball into the box, that's cleared away straight to a Real Madrid man.
[12080.00 - 12086.00] P:1864.48 E:0.104408 |  Casamiro was able to stab it away, Liverpool putting pressure on here, Alexander-Arnold drives it in,
[12086.00 - 12094.00] P:1780.82 E:0.095921 |  it's a deflection but it didn't take it on target from Jota, ten years to touches really and from here it flashed beyond the far post.
[12094.00 - 12104.00] P:1747.82 E:0.090953 |  He thought about crossing it, Alexander-Arnold takes a touch, head up 22-23 yards out, right hand side of the box and drives the ball,
[12104.00 - 12112.00] P:1639.81 E:0.082286 |  it's wider the far post but Jota tried to be alert and just get a deflection on it, missed it all together.
[12112.00 - 12119.00] P:1693.27 E:0.087497 |  Liverpool now, Real Madrid won tomorrow in five lives sport commentary on the Monaco Grand Prix,
[12119.00 - 12123.00] P:1690.72 E:0.086409 |  will obviously be across Huddersfield, Nottingham Forest as well tomorrow.
[12123.00 - 12133.00] P:1620.31 E:0.091363 |  Now Scotland-Ukraine on Wednesday, Andy Robertson captaining Scotland in that one and then we've got the Four England internationals as well as we move into summer.
[12133.00 - 12144.00] P:1637.54 E:0.087299 |  Tonight the focus is here, north of the French capital, inside this stadium where there's been all manner of problems for the supporters outside the ground tonight,
[12144.00 - 12158.00] P:1570.91 E:0.093239 |  mainly it seems the Liverpool fans will hear more about that, I'm sure from eyewitness accounts later on in the evening and in 6-0-6 the lines are open 08-05-9-0-9-6-9-3,
[12158.00 - 12170.00] P:1655.18 E:0.085566 |  Chris Sutton here in the Stade de France and Robbie Savage back in the studio will be taking your calls tonight and Liverpool have 15 minutes left and they've conceded a free kick.
[12170.00 - 12181.00] P:1600.44 E:0.096063 |  And watch how long will Madrid take to take this free kick, get used to that for the rest of the game if it steers the same.
[12181.00 - 12193.00] P:1457.18 E:0.097325 |  I think we've got two of them tying up the laces at the moment of the four who are around the ball and in the end it is Tony Cross who is going to get up and place that ball down.
[12193.00 - 12201.00] P:1636.68 E:0.098177 |  And here is Cross's delivery into the penalty area beyond the far post, Casamiro going to touch and actually screwed it horribly wide.
[12201.00 - 12210.00] P:1661.02 E:0.092576 |  He was in there and miss-hitted and Liverpool break away, it's going to be a double change incidentally, Roberto Firmino and Keita are going to come on for Liverpool.
[12210.00 - 12218.00] P:1754.55 E:0.090297 |  They've made a change as number 2 and 3 for them. Carlo Ancelotti down there, the wise old bird has not made a change at all yet.
[12218.00 - 12225.00] P:1755.16 E:0.091864 |  And now here is Vinicius downfield but the offside flag is up, he was so far offside the assistant even put the flag up.
[12225.00 - 12238.00] P:1815.40 E:0.089263 |  Got away with it again, you know, Liverpool left from that free kick, Casamiro was free and he just tries to play it with the inside of his left foot across goal for a tapping but he gets it horribly wrong.
[12238.00 - 12249.00] P:1849.29 E:0.100327 |  Well it's not Tiago who's been replaced by Keita and now that's a surprise, it's the captain Jordan Henderson who's quickly taken the on-band off and passed it through Fabinho to Vandei.
[12249.00 - 12253.00] P:1905.16 E:0.096783 |  But it is now Tiago who is coming off with Firmino coming off.
[12254.00 - 12268.00] P:1783.74 E:0.098033 |  And then the tight, Firmino will play in the midfield roll and Keita conjure up to something and give Liverpool that drive.
[12268.00 - 12279.00] P:1640.23 E:0.098507 |  Well Jürgen Klopp had to make a little gamble here hasn't he? So that could potentially open Liverpool up but he has to go for it now with, as I say, less than 15 minutes to play.
[12280.00 - 12282.00] P:1717.99 E:0.112169 |  He's got to, he's got to go chasing the game.
[12283.00 - 12291.00] P:1575.26 E:0.092577 |  Roberto Firmino then takes up that position so Firmino is on, Jota is on, still Salah and Manet out there.
[12291.00 - 12298.00] P:1654.15 E:0.092691 |  This Liverpool team that's scored more goals this season than any other Liverpool team in a single season.
[12298.00 - 12306.00] P:1746.85 E:0.095042 |  Have to come up with another goal here right at the death in the 63rd match perhaps to take this to extra time.
[12307.00 - 12315.00] P:1767.47 E:0.092048 |  1-0 Real Madrid lead, 5-5 and the World Service from the BBC both through the middle, 4 Liverpool Firmino puts in the challenge,
[12315.00 - 12323.00] P:1742.53 E:0.100204 |  it's congested in there Manet, Sadio Manet as well, keeps his balance and now Alexander on the place and across and a sliding interception crucial,
[12323.00 - 12327.00] P:1745.89 E:0.101617 |  crucial again Real Madrid defending well, getting the bodies in the right places.
[12327.00 - 12334.00] P:1871.72 E:0.106586 |  Venicius throws himself to the ground, the goal had long gone and Clement Turpan is not having any of that.
[12334.00 - 12338.00] P:1827.42 E:0.093856 |  And there you are Chris, that's your simulation game for tomorrow night, sorted out.
[12338.00 - 12344.00] P:1732.30 E:0.093210 |  Here come Liverpool again to the edge of the area, Firmino to the left hand side, it's chipped across Salah's after it but it's cleared away,
[12344.00 - 12346.00] P:1740.70 E:0.089285 |  Mindy coming across from the left back position.
[12346.00 - 12351.00] P:1763.89 E:0.104719 |  Defending from Mindy, Liverpool is putting the pressure on the game.
[12351.00 - 12355.00] P:1840.92 E:0.094430 |  Firmino from the angle, shooting but it's straight in for Real Madrid,
[12355.00 - 12360.00] P:1768.65 E:0.102656 |  bodies inside the penalty area, advances out for a throw on the left hand side, less than 12 minutes to play.
[12360.00 - 12369.00] P:1564.38 E:0.085379 |  Real Madrid leading 1-0, Jota now back out to the newly arrived Naby Keita, Keita low ball into the edge of the box,
[12369.00 - 12378.00] P:1749.15 E:0.104612 |  advances back for Liverpool, nice footwork, now on the left hand side, it's played across by Firmino but he couldn't find Manet and in any case actually the offside flag is open, it's a Real Madrid free kick.
[12378.00 - 12384.00] P:1735.48 E:0.099914 |  He's already had 3 or 4 really clever touches hasn't he Firmino up there, he's just dropped short.
[12385.00 - 12397.00] P:1820.47 E:0.098154 |  Not sure he's actually offside there myself, it's really really tight but really clever touches from, you know, linking up player, bringing people into the game which they haven't really had in this second half,
[12397.00 - 12406.00] P:1823.62 E:0.096562 |  we saw it 3 or 4 times in the first half when Manet came short or Salah came short and got the ball and turned, well he's already did it 3 or 4 times now.
[12407.00 - 12424.00] P:1586.77 E:0.096451 |  Real Madrid player has clipped to the ground as well in the mid-stable that there was a huge groan from the Liverpool fans, it's taken him a while to get to his feet but he has now, Millet out and so Real Madrid with the free kick,
[12424.00 - 12437.00] P:1668.98 E:0.085047 |  Vinicius scoring the goal, just short of the hour, set up by Valverde and Liverpool now have to try and find a way to create chances and find a way past Courtois as well.
[12437.00 - 12446.00] P:1764.49 E:0.096982 |  Salah on the right hand side, low ball across into the box Firmino back to Salah, low shot, took an affliction, Courtois is able to go down and react yet again,
[12446.00 - 12453.00] P:1785.83 E:0.107145 |  took all the pace off the ball but Courtois had to change direction and was able to get there and push it wide with Jotar arriving.
[12453.00 - 12466.00] P:1762.48 E:0.094966 |  Firmino's made an impact, cushions the ball back to Salah who fires a shot in and Jotar inadvertently deflected the ball on target, Courtois once again saves Real Madrid.
[12466.00 - 12476.00] P:1705.94 E:0.102384 |  Alexander-Arnold with the corner in and the opposition's a low one and Real Madrid though were lively, Benzema was able to clear it away and there's a 50-50 here that Kata comes out with the ball,
[12476.00 - 12485.00] P:1863.97 E:0.104102 |  Kata's out to throw in, the referee says, hang on a minute, it was given the way of Liverpool by the assistant.
[12485.00 - 12493.00] P:1778.77 E:0.097766 |  He's actually made a big error out of the referee because it was Liverpool's throwing and it took it quickly Kata and the referee actually stopped him from doing it.
[12493.00 - 12496.00] P:1790.16 E:0.096575 |  Isn't saying they've taken it from the wrong foot, I think that might be how he's...
[12496.00 - 12500.00] P:1837.27 E:0.105862 |  I think the referee saw it the other way and just made a mistake there.
[12501.00 - 12502.00] P:1811.21 E:0.119766 |  That can happen, Chris.
[12504.00 - 12520.00] P:1783.45 E:0.095840 |  Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 1, Chai running out, he has Mane, Mane into the penalty area on the left-hand side Firmino pulls it back and in the round, no, no, Kata with the shot in the D arriving on it.
[12520.00 - 12525.00] P:1699.45 E:0.094059 |  That was a big chance and he snatched at it and hit it horribly wide.
[12525.00 - 12540.00] P:1780.07 E:0.096659 |  It was a difficult chance, he's tried to hit it with the outside of the right foot when he's running onto the ball but again clever play from Firmino, getting in behind the Real Madrid back four to the byline and pulling it back and what, 20 yards out, Kata.
[12542.00 - 12543.00] P:1723.31 E:0.112212 |  Horrible effort wasn't it?
[12544.00 - 12549.00] P:1734.50 E:0.106533 |  It's easy to say after, but maybe it would have been better suited to go with his left foot.
[12550.00 - 12555.00] P:1458.59 E:0.084165 |  Into the last 10 minutes now of this Champions League final.
[12556.00 - 12558.00] P:1413.99 E:0.090577 |  Liverpool have to come up with a goal.
[12559.00 - 12562.00] P:1652.45 E:0.093458 |  Real Madrid get another one now, that's it, that would have to be it.
[12564.00 - 12569.00] P:1657.34 E:0.093821 |  Van Dijk heads the ball forward, bounces back for Fabinho.
[12569.00 - 12575.00] P:1815.74 E:0.109042 |  Fabinho's pass over the top from the half-time, brilliant control from Salah, Salah shoots, Okordra saved it again.
[12576.00 - 12588.00] P:1752.14 E:0.105742 |  That was magnificent from the Belgian goalkeeper of Real Madrid, Salah must have thought this is the equaliser and Okordra diving to his right somehow deflected it up and over the top corner.
[12588.00 - 12601.00] P:1715.61 E:0.100737 |  Well if Real Madrid go on to win this competition then they've got him to thank because that is another exceptional save, 1v1, we've seen it Salah many times, just tries to clip the pass then but he sticks his arm out and saves it.
[12601.00 - 12606.00] P:1639.68 E:0.091903 |  Corner for Liverpool which comes in and is headed away near the penalty spot by Valverde.
[12607.00 - 12612.00] P:1603.44 E:0.093904 |  Is that the pick of the save so was it the save from Manny in the first half, they were both outstanding.
[12613.00 - 12620.00] P:1763.15 E:0.104076 |  Salah again into the edge of the area, Salah gets the ball back, advances away and this could be Real Madrid away on the counter attack.
[12621.00 - 12630.00] P:1844.43 E:0.108168 |  Venetius a little ball pass, Kroos, Benzema's waiting in the middle, Kroos finds him, Benzema plays it back through for Venetius but Alisson was able to slide out and gather it.
[12631.00 - 12643.00] P:1753.14 E:0.100505 |  And now Alisson under arms it out and Liverpool come back at Real Madrid and it's Salah now, Salah to Alexander-Arnold who's almost on the left wing, it's all over the place now this game to the edge of the area.
[12643.00 - 12646.00] P:1770.49 E:0.097324 |  Salah was challenging it, bounce back to Kroos.
[12646.00 - 12656.00] P:1801.28 E:0.100814 |  I mean and breathe again, it was brilliant from Alisson, it's Benzema, they've seen the run of Venetius Junior in behind the Liverpool back line and he's so good at it isn't he Alisson?
[12657.00 - 12666.00] P:1680.35 E:0.091129 |  Sweeper keeper, reading those situations here to get it right he did do, Liverpool attacking again but Courtois with the ball.
[12667.00 - 12669.00] P:1554.52 E:0.069810 |  Yep but I think...
[12670.00 - 12684.00] P:1660.64 E:0.095328 |  What a save that was John from Courtois, I mean brilliant from Mo Salah the touch, then to get him behind with his pace and get his effort away but he faced that giant of a figure, Courtois again, who comes out on top.
[12684.00 - 12701.00] P:1738.78 E:0.092875 |  Lovely flick over on the left hand side by Manage Jota though, ran away from him and Real Madrid do break with Motridge, gets underneath this pass and it's an amazing ball really to Venetius on the left hand side, Benzema has got it there.
[12702.00 - 12726.00] P:1808.29 E:0.092430 |  We're in the 85th minute and it's Liverpool nil, Real Madrid won and Eduardo Camavinga with all of his teenage energy is going to be sent on by Carlo Ancelotti and it's Valverde the man who set up the only goal so far who is going to be replaced by Camavinga.
[12727.00 - 12751.00] P:1787.61 E:0.103926 |  And Real Madrid, I think he might have a problem actually Valverde because he's sat down on the pitch, this could come from an injury and Motridge's name has gone up on the board, but Motridge doesn't seem to believe in the field, his name went up on the big screen, I don't think Motridge is going anywhere.
[12752.00 - 12766.00] P:1800.22 E:0.100608 |  Just going back to that Courtois save, it's brilliant from Salah, he shifted the ball and went with his right foot but after Courtois had made the save, Alaba jumped into his arms, it was like a goal celebration, that's how big that was.
[12767.00 - 12777.00] P:1550.48 E:0.104080 |  It was a brilliant, it was a reaction wasn't it, it was the way that he leapt to his right, ominously for Liverpool, Real Madrid are preparing Rodrigo.
[12778.00 - 12792.00] P:1486.10 E:0.100896 |  Carlo Ancelotti thinking that he might be able to come on and perform the coup de gras, he has Benzema running from deep playing it across but Robertson was able to get there first.
[12792.00 - 12804.00] P:1702.65 E:0.098698 |  Now Jota, Liverpool nail Real Madrid, one lines are open for 606 but Liverpool's latest attack breaks down, excellent from Carvajal, he's been a top performer as well tonight for Real Madrid, the right back.
[12805.00 - 12814.00] P:1572.72 E:0.097930 |  Corrections on the substitute, they're going to correct themselves, again I think UEFA has got a good deal of correcting to do tonight.
[12814.00 - 12843.00] P:1651.88 E:0.098306 |  Goal back to Camarvinga, so Modric as the announcement went is still on the field and Real Madrid go back into their own half, 86 minutes on the clock, Liverpool on the back foot and behind and Benzema over the top down the left hand side to Venetius, Alexander-Arnold gets back but he beats them Venetius and then back heels to Benzema and Alexander-Arnold crucially is able to dis-possess.
[12843.00 - 12859.00] P:1759.69 E:0.096643 |  The Real Madrid captain on the edge of the box and Liverpool quickly get it downfield, it's late now, Liverpool have got to come up with a goal and it's Mane into the penalty area playing it across but passing it straight into Casamiro and Real Madrid should clear and do clear.
[12859.00 - 12867.00] P:1792.35 E:0.093487 |  He's been brilliant tonight hasn't he, Casamiro, often the villain of the piece breaking things up, here we go.
[12867.00 - 12877.00] P:1763.22 E:0.098486 |  Goal played forward by Modric, four finishes who tried the timest run but had straight offside and it's a free kick to Liverpool, time running out for Liverpool Alan Shearer.
[12877.00 - 12889.00] P:1701.91 E:0.096964 |  Yeah you mentioned it Chris, about Casamiro being brilliant, Carvajal's being brilliant as well you know because Jota's not had a lot of luck since coming on, instead of Diaz who didn't get any change out of him either.
[12889.00 - 12901.00] P:1782.09 E:0.098092 |  Mane taking it on, up against Camarvinga who got a foot in on that attempted cross by Mane and blocked it and it's another corner for Liverpool, corner from the left hand side.
[12901.00 - 12911.00] P:1605.29 E:0.093880 |  Alexander-Arnold goes across, Liverpool need their men to perform here, to stand up, to come up with something special.
[12911.00 - 12913.00] P:1795.86 E:0.096289 |  Ball has to be better though doesn't it?
[12913.00 - 12928.00] P:1731.51 E:0.099557 |  It's got to be, yeah, got to be better from Alexander-Arnold with this set piece, here's his delivery, high curling towards the back post, Canate, no it's Courtois who gets there first against Canate and captures the ball almost off the head of the Liverpool man.
[12928.00 - 12941.00] P:1746.98 E:0.097318 |  Well again it was a poor ball from a set piece which you don't expect to happen so often for Liverpool, it was high and it gave the goalkeeper the opportunity Courtois to come and collect it and that he does very, very well.
[12941.00 - 12947.00] P:1558.97 E:0.091424 |  He has been the outstanding performer for Real Madrid tonight Courtois.
[12947.00 - 12954.00] P:1566.52 E:0.102296 |  Save off to save it, that's what you want to see from your goalkeeper the last couple of minutes of the game.
[12955.00 - 12962.00] P:1586.98 E:0.100423 |  Real Madrid set to make another substitution, just run the clock down, break the game up.
[12962.00 - 12983.00] P:1578.94 E:0.096062 |  Yeah it's not Rodrigo yet, he's itching to get on there, Rodrigo, he's standing ready to go to the right of the dugout but it's Dani Ceballos who's going to come on, the former Arsenal loan player into the midfield, Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 1, Carlo Encelotti is just a few minutes away from becoming the first coach to come on.
[12984.00 - 13002.00] P:1652.88 E:0.099479 |  They win the Champions League four times as Cross stabs the ball out of play, knocks it away, almost playing for touch there, Cross throwing for Liverpool deep inside the wrong half and it is Modric this time who will come off and be replaced by Dani Ceballos.
[13002.00 - 13014.00] P:1691.14 E:0.102665 |  So the 36 year old who might be just a few minutes away from picking up his fifth Champions League winners, Neville, Leaves the field and Dani Ceballos comes on.
[13015.00 - 13029.00] P:1694.78 E:0.085960 |  Yeah, little magician, and the city fame for his artist, another little artist leaving the pitch to lose Le Trec John, Degas, Modric this evening.
[13029.00 - 13045.00] P:1792.04 E:0.085709 |  Yeah, here's Firmino playing the ball over the top through the middle and headed away by Camarvinga. You've been in the loose guidebook haven't you Chris? I think that's what's happened.
[13045.00 - 13060.00] P:1919.85 E:0.095017 |  Here's Mane on the left hand side, back to Keita and now that the police are arriving behind the goal to our right, police with wearing helmets and carrying shields, they're obviously conscious they do not want a pitch invasion.
[13060.00 - 13075.00] P:1795.06 E:0.088653 |  Here Liverpool come again, cleared away on the edge of the box and we are in added time now, five minutes of added time have been indicated. That is how long Liverpool have got to find an equaliser and take this final to extra time.
[13075.00 - 13093.00] P:1761.26 E:0.097143 |  Liverpool in their third final of the season, Benzema playing it through now and a chance for Ceballos who's into the penalty area but then couldn't find either of his teammates and the ball is stabbed behind by Liverpool for a Real Madrid corner and Dani Ceballos had a chance to finish it off.
[13093.00 - 13107.00] P:1748.88 E:0.096092 |  He panicked, he looked too phased in front of goal, it was such a clever run, well timed run, the ball was played into him but then he didn't really know what to do once he got in there and gave Liverpool the opportunity to get back.
[13108.00 - 13122.00] P:1794.98 E:0.096381 |  Real Madrid had one corner in the first half, this is their first corner of the second half, but crucially they've got one goal and Liverpool have none.
[13122.00 - 13151.00] P:1559.24 E:0.096930 |  It's a corner that Benzema and Croce are going to take between themselves and then play back to Casamiro and now Croce again on the left hand side carrying the ball to the halfway line playing it in field, Ceballos, now Benzema, Benzema, quick steps into the penalty area and then knocked it across, Camarvinda with the left footed shot but he pulled it, left footed high over the angle of Croce and Bar and Carlo Ancelotti making another change now and it is Roderico,
[13152.00 - 13167.00] P:1741.02 E:0.104230 |  the man with the late shot in the burn of Al against Manchester City who is coming on for the final minutes and he's going to take the place of the man who scored the only goal of this Champions League final, Vinicius.
[13182.00 - 13186.00] P:1833.80 E:0.098706 |  So, he's decided this season's Champions League and looks that way.
[13188.00 - 13200.00] P:1658.35 E:0.093069 |  So, off comes Vinicius, he's slapped on the back, he's padded on the cheeks, Liverpool played forward and got a touch but it bounces down into the penalty area and is steered away by Militão.
[13200.00 - 13215.00] P:1663.64 E:0.092706 |  Alexander-Arnold in added time now, plays the ball, crosses it towards the back post, Mane has beaten in the air, still Liverpool, Sabayos and Jota are wrestling together on the far side, the ball comes out for Liverpool, Mane hit the dead ball,
[13215.00 - 13233.00] P:1767.63 E:0.089297 |  the line chips it across but it's had it away and he's opposed by Real Madrid and those white shirts are able to hold out again, it would be a brilliant clean sheet this if Real Madrid see this through and win the Champions League for a 14th time in the next few minutes and then Croce draws a foul, wins a free kick off inside his own half.
[13233.00 - 13248.00] P:1723.81 E:0.095546 |  They've defended well if it is a clean sheet, they've got one man to thank haven't they, I know they've defended well at times but when Liverpool have got through that back four, they've just not been able to find a way past the brilliance of Quartuá tonight.
[13249.00 - 13254.00] P:1589.93 E:0.101391 |  And that was Benzema back there, right back position, defending.
[13256.00 - 13262.00] P:1565.43 E:0.108273 |  They're the mentality monsters in terms of the Champions League this season, time and time again.
[13264.00 - 13272.00] P:1533.19 E:0.097608 |  They've come back, miracles, they do happen. Tonight they've been street wise haven't they?
[13272.00 - 13283.00] P:1765.00 E:0.091691 |  Quartuá takes this free kick downfield but just effectively passes it to the goalkeeper at the other end, Alisson. We are in the fourth minute of five at that time.
[13283.00 - 13304.00] P:1814.87 E:0.091449 |  Liverpool have got 75 seconds now to come up with an equalising goal. This Liverpool team that has had such goal power this season but they have not been able to find a way past that man in green down there with his big gloves.
[13305.00 - 13315.00] P:1703.59 E:0.097530 |  T-Bow, Quartuá throwing for Real Madrid, just taking up the Benzema. Liverpool Fabinho has to play back to Alisson, Alisson takes a heavy touch, oh my goodness.
[13316.00 - 13328.00] P:1879.63 E:0.099400 |  Then gets past Dani Sopayos and then passes it to Canate, Liverpool still just inside their own half, Keita. Liverpool come forward again, one of their last chances.
[13328.00 - 13338.00] P:1857.12 E:0.104816 |  Fabinho right for the ball into the box but Quartuá is there to gather it, just a little hop on the edge of his six yard box, catches him into his chest and blocks onto his foot.
[13339.00 - 13352.00] P:1718.84 E:0.101534 |  He's collected everything, not only has he been fantastic in terms of the number of saves that he's made but dominating his box and giving his defenders that chance to just relax because once they know he's coming he's collected.
[13352.00 - 13359.00] P:1784.41 E:0.095327 |  There's not been a problem for him at all coming for crosses. Donoff make the defenders job so much easier.
[13360.00 - 13366.00] P:1638.12 E:0.102323 |  Time is almost up, Dani Sopayos has put the ball into the net from the half way line but it had already been given as a Liverpool free kick.
[13367.00 - 13380.00] P:1699.51 E:0.108323 |  And that's it, there's no more time. It's all over and Real Madrid have won the Champions League for a 14th time and their players are rapturous.
[13380.00 - 13403.00] P:1662.17 E:0.101324 |  They're running in all directions all over the pitch and Liverpool have fallen short and have lost here in the final. Just the one goal in it but Liverpool lost to Real Madrid in Kiev four years ago and tonight they've been beaten by Real Madrid here in Paris as well.
[13404.00 - 13414.00] P:1765.25 E:0.099037 |  They hoped it was going to be a quadruple, they thought it might be a treble. Liverpool this season will just have to settle for the domestic double.
[13416.00 - 13427.00] P:1646.67 E:0.108968 |  Flares and smoke bombs go off in the Liverpool end but also in the Real Madrid end to the left where the celebrations go on for the undisputed kings of Europe who've done it again.
[13427.00 - 13435.00] P:1579.19 E:0.101534 |  And Real Madrid have won the final by one goal to nil, that finishes goal in the second half for Sutton and Alonsoyra.
[13436.00 - 13446.00] P:1606.01 E:0.105302 |  In Courtois, sprints the length of the pitch to celebrate with the Real Madrid fans. He was the difference in the game. Numerous saves but two incredible pieces of goalkeeping.
[13446.00 - 13456.00] P:1628.27 E:0.103277 |  The one in the first half with fingertips got it onto the post and then the second half, Salah went through and his reactions to save the ball and keep it out the net. Absolutely phenomenal.
[13457.00 - 13462.00] P:1664.19 E:0.105001 |  This Real Madrid team, they know how to win and Jolotti going back there has transformed them.
[13464.00 - 13465.00] P:1579.11 E:0.121201 |  They had to get over the line Alonsoyra.
[13465.00 - 13476.00] P:1635.54 E:0.102933 |  This was my worry for the Liverpool team because when you look at how they actually got here, PSG, Chelsea, Manchester City, that tells you that they've got such a tough mentality.
[13477.00 - 13490.00] P:1639.95 E:0.105353 |  They were down and out so many times, so many people said that Manchester City should have beaten them. They got lucky. They didn't get lucky, it's their attitude and it's their manager and their experience and it's the quality that they have up top.
[13490.00 - 13497.00] P:1673.22 E:0.098559 |  Well, they've had to rely on that tonight but they've also had to rely on a brilliant performance from their goalkeeper, Courtois.
[13498.00 - 13508.00] P:1760.87 E:0.099205 |  Not only was his first save in the first half superb down to his right hand side. The 1v1 he had with Salah late on and the second off but also the way he dominated his box.
[13508.00 - 13520.00] P:1622.07 E:0.102747 |  When balls were coming in from set pieces from out wide into the box he came and collected and never flatted at anything. He collected everything. Everything stuck with him and he's the man of the match for Real Madrid tonight.
[13521.00 - 13530.00] P:1535.72 E:0.101852 |  The undisputed man of the match, T-Ball, Courtois but Carlo Ancelotti is down there as well. Punching the air in front of the Real Madrid fans.
[13531.00 - 13540.00] P:1574.74 E:0.103217 |  This great man of European football, Carlo Ancelotti at the age of 62. This time last year he was still the manager of Everton.
[13541.00 - 13553.00] P:1734.56 E:0.092092 |  Now back at Real Madrid he makes history as the first coach to win the Champions League four times and Real Madrid make yet more history themselves in this competition.
[13553.00 - 13562.00] P:1596.28 E:0.097966 |  Winning it for a record 14th time. Liverpool 0, Real Madrid 1 in the final score here in the start to France. Steve Cosman.
[13563.00 - 13572.00] P:1689.64 E:0.095944 |  Energetic celebrations from Real Madrid players in their wide shirts and green tracksuit to the left hand side. On the right though a picture of Liverpool devastation.
[13572.00 - 13585.00] P:1658.70 E:0.089605 |  Virgil van Dijk is sitting on his backside in the centre of the Liverpool penalty area. Trent Alexander-Arnold has not moved a muscle in the last four minutes since the full-time whistle went.
[13586.00 - 13601.00] P:1615.59 E:0.094356 |  He's standing just next to the centre circle in his white boots with his hands on his hips and every so often as Jordan Henderson is doing right now someone walks over and consoles him and hugs him and he says thank you and he shakes a hand and then he stays in that exact same position.
[13602.00 - 13617.00] P:1679.63 E:0.090460 |  And only now he begins to tentatively hobble away. Alan Shearer we said the critical battle could be Trent Alexander-Arnold and Venetius Jr. and it was Venetius who got the better of him at the crucial time.
[13617.00 - 13627.00] P:1764.02 E:0.095648 |  Yeah Trent just got caught out didn't he? You just got caught on his heels at the far post and he said it was a wonderful cross come shot from Valverde. That's what you have to do in that position.
[13628.00 - 13646.00] P:1733.73 E:0.094827 |  If there's going to be a side where you miss it out you have to miss it at the far post because there's always a chance that one the keeper will parry it out. Two it'll hit the post or if you don't hit it as well as you hope and want then there's going to be someone coming in at the far post and that's exactly what happened and that's exactly what Venetius Jr.
[13647.00 - 13652.00] P:1563.57 E:0.096220 |  And just for that split second Trent switched off and he got punished. I'll go on Chris.
[13653.00 - 13665.00] P:1601.70 E:0.101605 |  No it's terrific forward play it is because he gambles. He expects whether we call it a cross or a miss hit shot and then the easiest to finish is but Alexander-Arnold switching off.
[13665.00 - 13678.00] P:1621.22 E:0.092473 |  Just know how to win don't they? Their big players turned up tonight. Casamiro is outstanding. Modric was more prominent the longer the game went on. Benzema we talked about his leadership before the game leading from the front.
[13679.00 - 13680.00] P:1761.73 E:0.104129 |  Kortar was just phenomenal.
[13680.00 - 13695.00] P:1632.77 E:0.097893 |  Carver Hall and right back as well Chris. I thought he didn't give any change at all to Siddias in that first half. He then came off. Jota went to that side. Marni tried to guns to that side but whoever he was up against he didn't give them a kick tonight.
[13696.00 - 13706.00] P:1774.82 E:0.088082 |  Julian Alaron has rejoined us. Jules Chris has just said it. Rayal Madrid just win. Some teams defend better than them. Some probably even attack better than them. Nobody wins like Rayal Madrid.
[13706.00 - 13720.00] P:1653.97 E:0.092255 |  Exactly that sums it up so well. They probably not even the better team most of the time in the Champions League this season. How many times, how many minutes have they really been on top of the opposition controlling the games on the front full tonight?
[13721.00 - 13735.00] P:1766.27 E:0.088005 |  They were under pressure for most of it and Kortar just had one of those games, one of those moments where they could have had 25 shots. They would have never scored Liverpool. The game could have gone on for another half an hour, another 45 minutes.
[13736.00 - 13746.00] P:1795.35 E:0.091473 |  They were under pressure for that because he was in that kind of form. Again they've got something special in this competition. That's why Kortar has been so good tonight. That's why Benzema has been so good. That's why Mojic has been so good in the competition.
[13747.00 - 13757.00] P:1726.04 E:0.094096 |  It's part of the DNA and I don't know if on the plane tonight they will celebrate or they will fall asleep but it's just another one. For Benzema, for Mojic, it's also an incredible generation.
[13757.00 - 13769.00] P:1641.13 E:0.090545 |  They've won it five times in eight years. Five times in eight years. The biggest competition at club level. The toughest one to win and yet this is the back garden.
[13770.00 - 13784.00] P:1661.46 E:0.092497 |  There are so many amazing numbers Alan about Real Madrid. I mean we could talk about the fact that this is their 14th European Cup which is twice as many as the second most successful club and more than the second and third combined.
[13784.00 - 13794.00] P:1702.47 E:0.086421 |  But the number of finals, John gave the stat during commentary. They've now won eight Champions League finals in a row. When they get here they win.
[13795.00 - 13803.00] P:1750.63 E:0.101515 |  It's what they demand. It's what their fans want. It's what their president wants. They have to deliver this trophy. It's the be all and end all form isn't it?
[13803.00 - 13816.00] P:1650.56 E:0.092367 |  Such is their mentality. I mean we had the discussion before the game didn't we about this Liverpool team, about how great they've been and how difficult they're going to make it for Real Madrid.
[13817.00 - 13825.00] P:1733.46 E:0.092037 |  But I always thought that this was going to be an incredibly tough game because of the history, because of how they got here, because of their experience and their attitude.
[13826.00 - 13835.00] P:1681.46 E:0.097759 |  And let's not forget they've got some blum and good players in there who at the highest level and when it matters most they perform. And the manager, he's been there, seen it, done it.
[13836.00 - 13843.00] P:1652.52 E:0.088649 |  What about him and what about his incredible career? It's staggering. Absolutely staggering.
[13844.00 - 13851.00] P:1782.08 E:0.092321 |  I think Gilles, the thing that says it all is the first thing that happened on the full-time whistle was Luca Modric, who's one of the best players in the world.
[13852.00 - 13858.00] P:1818.32 E:0.089115 |  You know before he ran off and took off to congratulate the brilliant T-Ball Côtois, he jumped into the arms of Carlo Ancelotti.
[13859.00 - 13870.00] P:1735.02 E:0.096339 |  Exactly. And those players and the ones who were with him in 2014 already know what they owe him. And yes there have been managers and there will be who changed the games more than Carlo did the game as in the football.
[13870.00 - 13880.00] P:1824.78 E:0.092052 |  More than Carlo, Arigos Saki, Gargiola maybe can be in that category and others. Carlo hasn't changed something. There's been no Carlo Ancelotti revolution if you want.
[13881.00 - 13894.00] P:1758.67 E:0.089962 |  But he's got this incredible ability of getting the best out of his players when it matters the most. And is he the greatest because he has been the most successful in terms of league trophies because he won the five big leagues?
[13894.00 - 13904.00] P:1814.66 E:0.088159 |  Or because the Champions League because he's the only one to have won four of them? I don't know but certainly what he's been doing through those years is just incredible.
[13905.00 - 13915.00] P:1684.70 E:0.102137 |  I think it's worth just repeating, you know, talking about Ancelotti, what Marcelo said about him, you know, his work within for eight years. Why it is that he's done and achieved what he has.
[13915.00 - 13926.00] P:1740.73 E:0.083856 |  And those words from Marcelo last night which I thought, you know, some say, almost puts together all the qualities you'd want from a football manager which were, he understands the game, he knows how to manage the dressing room.
[13927.00 - 13935.00] P:1701.19 E:0.088164 |  We've hardly had any problems this season with him in charge. He's calm and he's truthful. Simple.
[13935.00 - 13947.00] P:1706.18 E:0.085941 |  Who would have given Real Madrid a chance to win this competition at the start of the season? Second group game, they lost to Sheriff. I mean, think about that. That's incredible.
[13948.00 - 13958.00] P:1806.50 E:0.085819 |  For Ancelotti to come in and do the job which he has done and organise this wily old team who know how to get over the line. It's quite incredible.
[13959.00 - 13965.00] P:1662.12 E:0.088959 |  Well done, Chris, for avoiding the temptation to make a pun on the word sheriff there. It's very much unlike you.
[13967.00 - 13969.00] P:1644.18 E:0.095311 |  I should have gone to town.
[13970.00 - 13978.00] P:1899.50 E:0.084097 |  And the other thing to say as well, Alan, is, you know, John has just quoted there a list of characteristics that Carlo Ancelotti has.
[13978.00 - 13990.00] P:1822.10 E:0.080569 |  Every single one of them that he's listed is timeless and it's 19 years since Ancelotti won his first Champions League. All of those qualities, football's meant to move on, football's meant to change.
[13991.00 - 13993.00] P:1867.75 E:0.077974 |  Everything John mentioned there lasts forever.
[13994.00 - 14006.00] P:1797.52 E:0.087567 |  Well, football does move on and football does change because attitudes change and dressing rooms change and that's an ability in itself is to be able to adapt to the different attitudes
[14006.00 - 14015.00] P:1788.98 E:0.088951 |  and the different personalities that come into your dressing room and how to handle the players' attitudes and mentalities.
[14016.00 - 14026.00] P:1868.51 E:0.088432 |  John also mentioned, like, nothing else. It looks as if it phases him. He's so professional. He's so clever in what he does and how he delivers it.
[14026.00 - 14035.00] P:1753.44 E:0.085013 |  And to get, I mean, he's rinsed every single ounce of ability out of these Real Madrid players because I've mentioned it before.
[14036.00 - 14044.00] P:1880.57 E:0.086265 |  There's so many times in this competition that they were gone. They were out. There was no way back we kept hearing, but they kept on finding a way back.
[14045.00 - 14052.00] P:1769.22 E:0.084769 |  Or he kept on finding a way back, whether they missed big players in big games, how they coped with that. That's not luck.
[14052.00 - 14060.00] P:1842.99 E:0.087750 |  There might have been lucky at times, but it's not luck to get to this position and win this tournament after what and who they've had to beat to get here.
[14061.00 - 14070.00] P:1765.76 E:0.084979 |  Absolutely. I think PSG, Chelsea, Manchester City, you know, they have really earned this one, haven't they? Liverpool in the final.
[14071.00 - 14078.00] P:1855.50 E:0.090083 |  We also mentioned, we also mentioned, Cortua has saved tonight. What about that save in that semi-final?
[14078.00 - 14088.00] P:1839.04 E:0.090632 |  With Jack Grealish, the one who just sticks his toe out, to knock that one past the post also. So he has more than played his part.
[14089.00 - 14099.00] P:1812.23 E:0.089668 |  Yes, we've spoken about Benzema in all his goals and rightly so, but at crucial times, Cortua has more than played his part in helping win this competition for Real Madrid.
[14099.00 - 14107.00] P:1695.67 E:0.094624 |  The Madrid papers that I was reading the morning after that match, they all were naming Cortua as the man of the match after that incredible semi-final.
[14108.00 - 14111.00] P:1758.48 E:0.096647 |  Despite the way that Rodrigo scored the goals, etc, etc.
[14111.00 - 14120.00] P:1636.62 E:0.088989 |  To mention as well, many of the Liverpool supporters after this defeat have already left the stadium and I have to say, you don't blame them, do you?
[14121.00 - 14130.00] P:1709.40 E:0.092901 |  After the night that many of them have had, and we think many Liverpool fans are not able to get into the ground tonight, all sorts of things as we've been reporting all the way through the course of the evening.
[14131.00 - 14133.00] P:1689.68 E:0.080494 |  And I think still some difficulties outside the ground.
[14134.00 - 14145.00] P:1798.32 E:0.088469 |  Yes, well, I have a UEFA statement in front of me now. UEFA say this, in the lead-up to the game, the turnstiles at the Liverpool end became blocked by thousands of fans who purchased fake tickets which didn't work in the turnstiles.
[14146.00 - 14153.00] P:1763.71 E:0.092103 |  This created a build-up of fans trying to get in. As a result, the kick-off was delayed by 35 minutes to allow as many to get in as possible.
[14153.00 - 14158.00] P:1741.03 E:0.091177 |  As numbers outside the stadium continue to build up after kick-off, the police disperse them with tear gas and force them away from the stadium.
[14159.00 - 14163.00] P:1707.33 E:0.079087 |  UEFA is sympathetic to those affected by those events and will further review these matters.
[14164.00 - 14168.00] P:1837.27 E:0.082940 |  We've now been joined by Rob Harris, Global Soccer Correspondent for the Associated Press.
[14169.00 - 14173.00] P:1722.51 E:0.078605 |  Rob, I read your tweet out earlier. What did you witness outside the ground?
[14173.00 - 14180.00] P:1828.12 E:0.093779 |  Well, I witnessed a huge surge of fans quite early on in terms of the security authorities struggling to cope with them.
[14181.00 - 14187.00] P:1624.18 E:0.094940 |  And that seemed to continue through the evening as right up to kick-off and beyond, the fans still could not get in.
[14188.00 - 14196.00] P:1643.46 E:0.094604 |  And what we see in that UEFA statement with them talking about the ticketless fans who they say were trying to get in, I did see fans trying to scale the fences,
[14196.00 - 14201.00] P:1566.21 E:0.097131 |  but fans not noticeably in any colours that might well have been locals trying to get in.
[14202.00 - 14209.00] P:1731.42 E:0.093026 |  So that is one clear thing. And there were many hundreds of Liverpool fans just standing there peacefully who ended up being tear gassed.
[14210.00 - 14216.00] P:1805.60 E:0.089911 |  One woman who was an asthmatic, she said to me she was struggling because of that tear gas that was being deployed on her.
[14217.00 - 14221.00] P:1746.25 E:0.085130 |  And the French police, the riot police were deploying it quite readily at times.
[14221.00 - 14225.00] P:1913.95 E:0.087985 |  Scrutiny matters, journalism matters, especially at a time like this.
[14226.00 - 14235.00] P:1844.76 E:0.085615 |  You said that you witnessed UEFA staff actually trying to help out whilst members of the security staff outside were trying to stop filming.
[14236.00 - 14240.00] P:1801.54 E:0.086368 |  Yeah, that was some security staff trying to stop me filming as it was going on.
[14241.00 - 14250.00] P:1694.35 E:0.085740 |  And the fact is, having already heard of previous instances, I went immediately towards UEFA personnel who then intervened to ensure that actually our rights to report hopefully were protected
[14251.00 - 14257.00] P:1809.46 E:0.088117 |  because there is a role obviously to try to document what is actually happening out there to show the scenes, particularly as fans are being impacted,
[14258.00 - 14261.00] P:1742.11 E:0.084278 |  peaceful fans who are just trying to get in to a Champions League final.
[14262.00 - 14267.00] P:1884.58 E:0.089887 |  What's also important, and please correct me if I get any of this bit wrong, but we're obviously talking quite a lot about UEFA.
[14268.00 - 14274.00] P:1804.44 E:0.088160 |  UEFA's statement that they put out on the screens about it being due to late arriving fans is not something that has gone down well at all.
[14275.00 - 14279.00] P:1910.08 E:0.091374 |  And it certainly wasn't our experience, but when it comes to the actual security outside the stadium,
[14280.00 - 14285.00] P:1836.42 E:0.088544 |  that's the French Football Federation, right? That's them who organised that, not European football's good-bearing calling.
[14286.00 - 14293.00] P:1851.70 E:0.092195 |  Yeah, this is a UEFA event in the sense they organise it, of course, at late notice compared to the other finals, only three months ago when the game was taken off St Petersburg.
[14294.00 - 14303.00] P:1782.64 E:0.085647 |  And it was the French police, the riot police and the local shooting personnel who were responsible for this were determining what to do in the moment as the fans were struggling to get in.
[14303.00 - 14310.00] P:1751.10 E:0.084912 |  But I was getting messages even from family members, the fans back home saying we're hearing a gate is being closed.
[14311.00 - 14316.00] P:1718.57 E:0.089760 |  Even can you go and see what's happening because they felt they might be crushed and there was deep concerns amongst fans.
[14317.00 - 14321.00] P:1795.30 E:0.091865 |  Rob, thank you very much for joining us. That's Rob Harris, a global soccer correspondent for the Associated Fresh.
[14322.00 - 14325.00] P:1947.81 E:0.092973 |  John Murray, the Liverpool players are going through the worst moment for any player in any final.
[14325.00 - 14335.00] P:1704.03 E:0.088872 |  Yes, we're having to watch that moment where the Liverpool players and staff are having to go up and receive their losers medals, their runners-up medals,
[14336.00 - 14346.00] P:1658.59 E:0.089530 |  and also having to make that walk initially through the Guard of Honor which is being provided by the Real Madrid players who are standing there in two columns,
[14346.00 - 14357.00] P:1637.59 E:0.077652 |  but they have to then walk past the European Cup that they won themselves so memorably in Madrid against Tottenham back in 2019.
[14358.00 - 14366.00] P:1739.95 E:0.085490 |  But they have to walk past it, led by Jurgen Klopp who I noticed did have a rueful smile on his face, but they have to walk past it with white ribbons on it, not red ribbons.
[14367.00 - 14376.00] P:1807.06 E:0.086530 |  And they also have to stand and wait and show the respect to the Real Madrid team and wait for them to be presented with their trophies and their medals,
[14377.00 - 14381.00] P:1843.09 E:0.087724 |  which in reality they probably just want to get off the pitch now and get back into the dressing room.
[14382.00 - 14389.00] P:1916.21 E:0.088625 |  08085909693 is the number to call for 6-06. Chris Sutton is with us here inside the Stade de France.
[14390.00 - 14392.00] P:1751.62 E:0.084287 |  Robbie Savage will be with him once the full-time whistle has...
[14392.00 - 14398.00] P:1856.80 E:0.080742 |  Oh, it's the full-time whistle. Once the trophy has been lifted, Liverpool players making their way to the right-hand side now.
[14399.00 - 14401.00] P:1931.77 E:0.082774 |  Real Madrid players getting ready to go up and get their medals.
[14402.00 - 14408.00] P:1999.97 E:0.085703 |  I've just caught a sight of Tebow Courtois, Chris, for the first time in a long time because he's been right at the heart of the celebrations.
[14409.00 - 14415.00] P:1970.15 E:0.081481 |  Chris Toftereur messaged me, our friend from the Euroleagues, to say that when he interviewed Courtois in the build-up to this game,
[14416.00 - 14423.00] P:1790.92 E:0.072770 |  he said, Tebow, who are Real Madrid's two most important players? He said, Karim Benzema and me. And he's not wrong.
[14424.00 - 14433.00] P:1619.19 E:0.090583 |  Yeah, that's pretty accurate. Somebody told me the stat before the game that Courtois has made more saves than any other goalkeeper in this competition.
[14434.00 - 14436.00] P:1719.35 E:0.104906 |  That tells you Real Madrid haven't defended all that well this season.
[14436.00 - 14446.00] P:1681.91 E:0.094271 |  Look down on the pitch now on the podium, Carlo Ancelotti in a huge bear hook together with Florentino Perez, the Real Madrid president.
[14447.00 - 14451.00] P:1505.33 E:0.089730 |  And they're huge cheer for that from the Real Madrid fans inside the ground. They've had quite a week, haven't they?
[14452.00 - 14458.00] P:1688.86 E:0.076341 |  And Bapé, coming, he's coming. He's not coming, but they've ended it with the European Cup.
[14458.00 - 14469.00] P:1845.02 E:0.081721 |  Tebow Courtois is, as I speak, getting his medal, shaking hands with the dignitaries, rubbing his eyes and putting it over the top of his head.
[14470.00 - 14480.00] P:1934.04 E:0.085309 |  The Real Madrid players moving toward the bright, shiny European Cup. Casemiro just rubs the white ribbons with the palms of his hand and makes his way toward the stage.
[14481.00 - 14486.00] P:1910.48 E:0.079872 |  And in the next couple of moments, John Murray, yet again, Real Madrid will lift the European Cup.
[14486.00 - 14489.00] P:1697.64 E:0.096284 |  Yes, it's Marcelo, the club captain who's waiting at the back of the line.
[14490.00 - 14498.00] P:1781.09 E:0.092472 |  Karen Benzema, this amazing season, 44 goals. He's the team captain. I guess they might well lift it together. Marcelo, the end of his 16th season.
[14499.00 - 14506.00] P:1836.96 E:0.089102 |  It said to him yesterday, one of the questioners said, Marcelo, what do you want? Do you want a statue built or do you want a new contract?
[14507.00 - 14515.00] P:1886.43 E:0.088157 |  And he gave a very diplomatic answer that he's waiting. He'll lift the trophy, but it's Real Madrid just doing what they do.
[14516.00 - 14523.00] P:1907.64 E:0.084866 |  We've been doing this since 1956, the very first season of the European Cup as it was.
[14524.00 - 14538.00] P:1885.28 E:0.081295 |  And back then in 1956, when they beat Rance in the final, here in Paris, incidentally, the then-president Santiago Bernabéu himself said, we have simply done our duty.
[14538.00 - 14549.00] P:1554.64 E:0.073778 |  So even back then, Real Madrid were expected to win the European Cup. And we've just seen them do it yet again here in the Stade de France tonight.
[14550.00 - 14557.00] P:1687.65 E:0.091807 |  And one by one, the players are going through there. In each of them, unlike Liverpool's players who just turn and look the other way as they walk past the European Cup,
[14558.00 - 14564.00] P:1468.78 E:0.089524 |  they are one by one receiving their winners medals and then going across and giving it a little stroke or a case or a cuddle or whatever it is.
[14564.00 - 14575.00] P:1725.08 E:0.079957 |  And only a couple more to go through now. Benzema and Marcelo at the back of the line, this incredible Champions League season that Real Madrid have had.
[14576.00 - 14584.00] P:1722.80 E:0.082964 |  They're extraordinary wins against Paris Saint-Germain and against Chelsea and against Manchester City and now against Liverpool.
[14585.00 - 14588.00] P:1883.55 E:0.093383 |  So they've done the English treble along the way, Real Madrid.
[14588.00 - 14599.00] P:1824.73 E:0.088068 |  And here comes Marcelo now. Alexander Cepherin goes across and hands it to Marcelo who's not going to raise it just yet because his team are waiting on the podium.
[14600.00 - 14609.00] P:1821.38 E:0.092566 |  And he's going to walk down Marcelo and carry it across and join his teammates. And he's urging the Real Madrid fans to come on, give it some noise.
[14609.00 - 14616.00] P:1838.22 E:0.079777 |  So here they go. Real Madrid. We thought their name was on the trophy. Well it is now.
[14617.00 - 14629.00] P:1842.27 E:0.089560 |  And Real Madrid rule Europe yet again. And Marcelo lifts the trophy above his head right in front of all of his jubilant teammates.
[14630.00 - 14642.00] P:1609.31 E:0.087613 |  And the Confetti, the Silver Confetti is sprayed everywhere. And as they celebrate down in front of us here, the Liverpool players all in red turn and head down to the dressing room.
[14643.00 - 14651.00] P:1844.53 E:0.087335 |  And right in the middle of all that as well as the fireworks go off, Carlo Ancelotti takes a big part in these celebrations.
[14651.00 - 14662.00] P:1738.98 E:0.078273 |  Coming to Real Madrid again. They won the league a month ago and now they've won the Champions League again for a 14th time, a fifth time in nine seasons.
[14663.00 - 14666.00] P:1726.30 E:0.077810 |  What a club. No wonder they call them the kings of Europe.
[14668.00 - 14675.00] P:1827.87 E:0.084920 |  It's an unbelievable night for Real Madrid. There were times this season, many times that nobody would have believed this.
[14675.00 - 14683.00] P:1848.99 E:0.082922 |  The early strains of we are the champions in the background. The Liverpool end to our right hand side has nearly cleared.
[14684.00 - 14689.00] P:1893.23 E:0.076967 |  The Liverpool players have trudged away. And Alan, you know that feeling. It's an awful feeling.
[14690.00 - 14697.00] P:1871.41 E:0.092854 |  It's horrible. I said earlier that they had to stand and show their respect to Real Madrid. But in truth, you just want to get off the pitch.
[14697.00 - 14711.00] P:1736.42 E:0.088801 |  You want to get into the dressing room because it hurts and it hurts a lot after the season that they've had to have the disappointment of losing out in the league despite performing so well.
[14712.00 - 14725.00] P:1795.51 E:0.091902 |  And then to have this disappointment also, they can still look back as hard as it will be and as much as it hurts after tonight, the season that they've had and bringing two trophies back, the Carabao and the FIA cup back to Anfield.
[14726.00 - 14729.00] P:1754.59 E:0.094236 |  They can still be very proud of what they've achieved this season.
[14730.00 - 14741.00] P:1807.35 E:0.089429 |  It's still been a great season for Liverpool. The whole ride, you know, the league cup, the FA cup. Yes, they've missed out in the league to a brilliant Manchester City side.
[14742.00 - 14752.00] P:1844.12 E:0.082545 |  Only just and then tonight, picked at the post, a game too many and it will feel more sour, I think because of the situation with their fans not getting into the stadium.
[14752.00 - 14755.00] P:1589.23 E:0.081807 |  You know, that will hurt even more for them.
[14756.00 - 14766.00] P:1818.49 E:0.091960 |  Well, let's bring in a Liverpool fan now. Keaton has joined us and Keaton, I'll ask you what you think about Chris was saying there, the end of Liverpool season and what a great effort they've put in.
[14767.00 - 14770.00] P:1875.58 E:0.094458 |  But I imagine we're talking to you because you didn't manage to get into the ground tonight.
[14771.00 - 14781.00] P:1553.91 E:0.088037 |  No, it's been a disgrace from the whole of, from just from everyone, from Liverpool fans, from UEFA, from the police, just from everyone. The whole game was an absolute disgrace.
[14784.00 - 14786.00] P:1822.04 E:0.106184 |  So did you have a ticket for the game?
[14787.00 - 14791.00] P:1588.77 E:0.090859 |  Yeah, the four of us in here, mate, all had genuine tickets and not one of us got in the game, into the ground.
[14792.00 - 14794.00] P:1760.21 E:0.100986 |  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[14795.00 - 14799.00] P:1578.62 E:0.073519 |  That's the only word I can use is chaos. It was on me.
[14801.00 - 14814.00] P:1795.46 E:0.093363 |  Keaton, I'm so sorry to hear that. Would you say, I mean, I'm trying to pick it up in your voice, but is it, it seems like a mixture of anger and, you know, the agony of not being able to see your team in a European final. It must be a lot.
[14815.00 - 14826.00] P:1374.00 E:0.077056 |  Yeah, yeah, it's, it's a hard one to take. I wanted to be in there and obviously I was losing it. It's a mix of emotions at the moment, like.
[14828.00 - 14838.00] P:1649.52 E:0.097959 |  And as far as the season goes, you know, your team have put absolutely everything into this campaign, haven't they? They didn't get over the line tonight, but I'm sure you're still very proud of those players.
[14839.00 - 14852.00] P:1375.99 E:0.082733 |  Oh, yeah, it's been, been an unreal journey following the boys. Like, it's couldn't have asked for any more. If you told me at the start of the season, we would have pushed it to the last game of the league to win the title and got to the Champions League final.
[14853.00 - 14859.00] P:1382.28 E:0.087510 |  I'm on both domestic cups. I would have beat your hand off. Like, it's been, been unreal following the boys this season, but.
[14860.00 - 14870.00] P:1686.26 E:0.093386 |  Keaton, thank you. I'm so sorry that you weren't able to get into the game. 08, 08, 5, 9, 0, 9, 6, 9, 3. Liverpool fans, you want to talk about your season. You want to talk about tonight.
[14871.00 - 14875.00] P:1771.74 E:0.086879 |  You want to talk about what happened outside the stadium. I know that Robbie and Chris will want to take those calls.
[14876.00 - 14881.00] P:1916.87 E:0.083816 |  Big thank you to BT Sport because they're allowing us to use this, which is an interview with Thibault Courtois.
[14881.00 - 14895.00] P:1470.17 E:0.097362 |  Yesterday in a press conference I said that when Madrid plays finals, they win it and I'm on the good side of history and I saw a lot of tweets coming my way of that they will, that I will get humbled today and it was the other way around.
[14896.00 - 14904.00] P:1476.61 E:0.098960 |  I think today I need to win a final for my career, for all the hard work to put respect on my name because I don't think I have enough respect, especially in England.
[14904.00 - 14917.00] P:1432.02 E:0.104296 |  I saw a lot of criticisms even after a great season that that was not good enough or whatever. I'm just really happy and proud of the performance of the team. We stuck through it and when I needed to be there I was there for the team.
[14918.00 - 14926.00] P:1419.55 E:0.099286 |  You've beaten PSG, Chelsea, Manchester City, now Liverpool. I mean it was destined for you this year, wasn't it?
[14926.00 - 14940.00] P:1517.03 E:0.102634 |  Yeah, I think we've beaten the best clubs of the world together with us. If you see this year of City and Liverpool, they were unbelievable this season. They fought at the end in the Premier League, they won two Cubs Liverpool.
[14941.00 - 14946.00] P:1478.38 E:0.102694 |  Today they were really strong and I think I played a great game and that was the difference today because we had one chance and we scored it.
[14947.00 - 14953.00] P:1825.86 E:0.077443 |  Thibault Courtois, Alan saying, quote, put some respect on my name.
[14953.00 - 14963.00] P:1847.53 E:0.084514 |  Well, we certainly have and he deserves it because he was man of the match without a doubt. I mean he's prevented Liverpool lifting that trophy tonight.
[14964.00 - 14982.00] P:1908.27 E:0.086304 |  The first save he made in the first half down to his right hand side from Sadier Mane was exceptional but I think the one in the second half where Morsala has done ever so well to take a couple of touches and you know these quick feet to get away from the defender and then try and poke it in the back of the net but he stood tall.
[14983.00 - 14999.00] P:1883.81 E:0.084829 |  He got that vital touch and just pushed it wide and also how commanding he was on his box. You know when Liverpool were getting desperate or when they were putting set pieces into the box, he wasn't afraid to come and collect that ball and he collected everything, it stuck to him.
[15000.00 - 15009.00] P:1840.40 E:0.087651 |  And for a defender, when you see your goalkeeper doing that, didn't off make your job a little bit easier and he was absolutely magnificent as he was in the semi-final as well.
[15009.00 - 15010.00] P:1382.85 E:0.029254 |  John?
[15010.00 - 15028.00] P:1601.10 E:0.081249 |  Yeah, a Liverpool statement on what happened around this final tonight which says we are hugely disappointed at the stadium entry issues and breakdown of the security perimeter that left Liverpool fans face this evening, that Liverpool fans faced this evening at the Stade de France.
[15028.00 - 15048.00] P:1579.26 E:0.079344 |  This is the greatest match in European football and supporters should not have to experience the scenes we have witnessed tonight and the statement ends by saying that Liverpool have officially requested a formal investigation into the causes of these unacceptable issues as it says.
[15049.00 - 15074.00] P:1588.48 E:0.082837 |  So yet again, yet again we've got that kind of statement having to be released after one of the biggest European football matches and I mean it's not just year after year, it is decade after decade that we have faced and seen occasions like this spoiled by one reason or another and in the end you have to say it comes down to the organisation.
[15074.00 - 15078.00] P:1614.92 E:0.076162 |  It's left the sourest of taste Alan, hasn't it?
[15078.00 - 15087.00] P:1828.66 E:0.089528 |  Yeah and so it should because so many people work so hard and spend their money to get to an occasion after what everyone's been through in recent years.
[15087.00 - 15098.00] P:1782.05 E:0.089360 |  So to come here and any which way they can and find a way here and have their ticket and then be denied entry and then treated that the way they were.
[15098.00 - 15117.00] P:1806.33 E:0.087110 |  I mean we sensed problems didn't we on our way and we had to get out of the car a mile or so from the stadium and walk the rest and as soon as we got out of the car we thought there's something not right here because it was just absolutely rampact and everyone was pushing and swaying and we almost lost each other.
[15117.00 - 15134.00] P:1787.86 E:0.083921 |  I mean we just made it in time to get on air so we knew that there were going to be issues but then to hear of people being sprayed and being treated the way that they were is pretty disgusting after everything that the Liverpool fans have done to get to this stadium.
[15134.00 - 15142.00] P:1838.21 E:0.085423 |  Well that you can hear in the background is Real Madrid's hymn and they are singing it at a Champions League final for the 14th time.
[15142.00 - 15160.00] P:1725.19 E:0.082187 |  They are the kings of Europe. The clue is in the name. Real Madrid, Royal Madrid. That marks the end John Murray of the football season and now football can rest. It can sleep. It's over for 24 hours.
[15161.00 - 15174.00] P:1763.32 E:0.084270 |  24 hours until we get another big game tomorrow and then a few more coming next week. Think of Andy Robertson who's got to pick himself up now and leave Scotland into that World Cup playoff against Ukraine on Wednesday night.
[15174.00 - 15186.00] P:1674.53 E:0.078831 |  But yeah another Champions League season comes to an end tonight. Another amazing season from this competition that consistently just keeps on delivering.
[15186.00 - 15198.00] P:1760.20 E:0.078390 |  I can't work out really for the sake of me why they feel that they need to change it apart from the obvious reason which is to try and make more money and keep the big clubs happy.
[15198.00 - 15209.00] P:1759.21 E:0.070287 |  But Real Madrid celebrating again what they will be calling back in the Spanish capital, La Decimocuarta, the 14th.
[15210.00 - 15220.00] P:1792.61 E:0.080974 |  John, Chris, Alan, thank you so much for the last few days. It's been wonderful and I'll speak to you all soon. John Murray, Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton who have been with us for the Champions League final.
[15220.00 - 15231.00] P:1819.32 E:0.081695 |  They say all that glitters is gold but looking down on the pitch it looks suspiciously silver. Real Madrid win the Champions League again. 6-0-6 follows the news.
