  "transcript": " Now to the back to Mark Gay, who's been as good as anyone in this England European Championship campaign so far. Declan Rice as well. Basically, is he Christiansen? Conor Cody, the pressure is on for these England players to deliver. It is. It certainly is, John, and what we want to see is an assured performance from England. We want to see some crisp passing out there, we want to see goals, and we want to see dominance to take us into the knockout stages with clarity and confidence. So we'll keep you across what's happening in the other match, Denmark and Serbia, both kicking off simultaneously. But in this group, this last match night in Group C, if England win, they will finish top. But if Denmark win, they'll go through. If Slovenia win, they'll go through. And if Serbia win, they'll go through. So there is lots to play for. The whistle goes from Clement Erpan, and this time it's Phil Forden who kicks off for England. Bukaj Osaka has taken the spot kick for the centre-circle kick for the first two matches. But Forden starts for England here, and England go back into their own half to Gay. First impressions are going to be important for England. The way that they start in the opening five minutes, the opening ten minutes, that's what everyone's going to look for tonight. They need a confidence build-out here in Cologne, where the sun's still shining, blue sky above, and down there on the pitch, which is a good deal better than the pitch in Frankfurt, of course it is. They're tripping out to Bellingham at close quarters, and then Bellingham taking it back into his own half to give Jordan Pickford his first touch. There's a bit of feeling behind that as he passed it out to John Stones. It comes back from Stones to Pickford, and now Mark Gay begins to travel forwards. Declan Rice has dropped all the way back there. Conor Gallagher has taken up a rather advanced position in midfield actually. Right now as I speak, it is Rice in the middle with Gallagher forward to his right, and Bellingham forward to his left. It comes back to Rice, and England are forced back towards the edge of their penalty area. Gay turns towards the flank, left-footed towards the half-way line, but it comes off a Slovenian head, and they will give a first touch. At the other end to Jan Oblak, is he? Oh, that's a short pass out from the back from Oblak, and Forden was very nearly onto that, but they were able to recover. Conor Ničnik was able to get there, but England now are able to snatch back position. Here's Rice on the left-hand side. Rice drags it back, Trippiana with his right foot, plays it down the line to Forden. Forden under this, drags it back, but as the challenge came in, he was trying to win the free kick off Krakusic. He actually deflected it behind, he tried to win the free kick, but he wasn't successful. It's a goal kick. It's more positive for England, Phil Foden getting in down that left-hand side. I think it was Rice that just fed the ball into the channel, and Foden is really tightly marked, and you can see what he's trying to do. He's trying to chop the ball back onto his right foot, but concedes the goal kick. England nail Slovenia, nail it, you've just switched on. Now a chance, the first chance of the match for Slovenia as Stojanovic is able to break through to the edge of the penalty area. It seemed to take a deflection, but the referee says very calmly it's a goal kick to England, who take a quick goal kick. Now Trippiana halfway inside is on half-care, and Trippiana will actually just pass it back to Pickford, who was looking the other way there. And in that, the referee has told them they need to go back and take the goal kick again. So, Pickford will do that. Pickford defending the goal to our right, where there is a raucous noise now coming out of the Slovenian supporters. Pickford long and left-footed. Cain had a look as B all came in with the challenge, but the left-sided central defender was headed out on the far side. Walker takes the throw back to John Stones. Crossfield pass from him, right-footed to Cain and Trippiana. Now all the way to the left-hand side to Phil Thornton. There's quite a lot of talk about whether the Premier League player of the season would keep his place in this team. But Garret Southgate making just the one change as Bellingham has given it away on the halfway line. And so Spora will take it on, and he's fouled by Gallagher. Gallagher, incidentally, is on a yellow card. He's the only England player who's received a booking at Euro 2024 so far. They take the free kick quickly, Slovenia. They've had the two 1-1 draws. Remember the first match when Christian Ericsson gave Denmark an early lead. And then the most recent match when Serbia scored deep, deep into added time to make it 1-1. He's carrying the ball forward, giving it centrally to El Sniik. Now out to the left-hand side. Maka is out there. Here's the cross, which is deflected to the back post, knotted back across the England area. Cesko with a head-up, but he didn't get any power on that. And Pickford was able to move quickly to his right and just gather it into his stomach. It comes from a loose pass from Jude Bellingham about a minute ago, and it's just given Slovenia a bit of impetus. And it's that man Cesko inside the box who is a real threat inside that area. Just a free header, wasn't it Conor? Yeah, it was. It was a great play from Kani, sneak down the right-hand side, right across the pitch to the opposite side. England just got to be a little bit carefully. Given away by Gey, now played for Deshesko, but in came Declan Rice with a covering challenge to take it away. careless again from England, that was a missed place pass from Gey. And I think the ball has just gone out of play on the far side it did. So it's a throw in to England. It's been a bit sloppy for England, to be honest. These opening exchanges, they look a little bit nervous out there. They've just been a couple of loose passes. You know, on the stakes like that, this Slovenian side has enough talent in it to take advantage. And Cesko's yet to score. I think he's done everything but, hasn't he? He's at the woodwork. He's had chances fly wide and high. Throw in taken by Walker and Kane rather awkwardly can't take it down. It's a difficult height for him. So Janža from left back. As Slovenia go back into central defence to Drakusic, tall and shaven headed. Long pass forward from him, Walker is there to head it back to Pickford, who's able to gather it and overarm it out. 0-0, five minutes played. Still 0-0 in the Denmark-Serbia game, the other match in the group. So it's as you were. It's tricky, he plays a right-footed ball forward for Bellingham to chase down the left wing. And Drakusic comes across and heads it out of play for an England throw. It's a good forward run from Bellingham. We've needed him to do that when Harry Kane drops deep to run the channels, squeeze England up the park, but England really needs to get some passes together now, get the grip of the game. Go back to the halfway line again into the centre-circle. Really is a sweltering night here. The hottest night that we've experienced so far in Cologne, Bellingham. Back towards the halfway line, Declan Rice was scoffing, wasn't it yesterday at the thought that fitness was a problem for the England teams. Almost left off the questions. He has gay trippie, ten yards inside his own half. And then Tickford comes out of his penalty area, whirling his arms. It is Stones in possession, those Stones passing it square to Gay again. And then Gay forward to the left-hand side to Foden. Foden's got trippie down the line, but Foden comes in field, goes back to the halfway line to Rice, and then Rice uses John Stones again. Pukaj Osaka, not sure I've mentioned his name yet. There he is though, in possession on the far side, quick ball back to Stones. Again, it goes square along the halfway line. Harry Kane's made himself available. Harry Kane so far at the Euros, just two touches in the opposition penalty area. Kane, long diagonal ball forward looking for Saka, Gallagher's over there. Slovenia are back in possession, and then Saka charges down the clearance, which is out for Slovenian ball. It would be interesting to hear what you think, but Slovenia are just being quite passive, aren't they? They're setting traps, they're not jumping and pressing, they're staying tight, structured. The hour is here, and do you know what? The shape's really good. They're in a 4-4-2, they're defending in a mid-block, low-block. They're in a situation where they're in contact with each other, and they're actually defending really well, but England are pushing on without a five going forward. We do, Bellungham, pushing on to the last line as well, so hopefully they can just sustain a bit of pressure there. So England will be going through tonight, whatever happens here, even if it's only in the third-place slot in the group, England's position in the round of 16 is secure. It's a question of which place they will finish in, first, second or third in the group. Right now, with the scorelines as they are, England would be going through to play one of the third-place sites, which would probably be the Netherlands, but that would have to be confirmed with the later matches in the other groups. Here's Trippier on the halfway line, gives it to Bellungham. Rice comes, 10 yards away, still inside Slovenian territory, once a break from Cesko, Bellungham makes the run, Declan Rice now to Kane, Kane turns his man on the edge of the box, tries to work it through, but Drakusic's just got enough on that, and Slovenia, Rear Avalde, a clear game back to Trippier. Trippier is going to go back into his own half, and that's what England are up against tonight. They're a rugged tear on a Drakusic and Beal. They're a problem, they've got some real quality in that. Good at defending, they're aggressive, you can just see here, Bellungham just dropping outside the structure of Sylvina, just to try and get touches on the ball, and they're out in this left position where it's meant to be more central, but that's where he's been given licence to go and receive the ball. Phil Fordham takes it in field, they did hit the post against Denmark, a couple of promising runs as well, but England with John Stones, winning his 75th cap tonight, John Stones. Gay to Bellungham, this is more central. Fordham back to Bellungham, couldn't take it in his stride, but again it's Slovenia who break away, and the ball slipped forward by Stojanovic, now Karnečnik, the right back, but England, Bellungham recovers well, and then Kane goes for the early pass to Fordham, Fordham into the penalty area on the left, Lefven and Krosbyd Saka slips over at the crucial moment, they were slightly behind him, and in actual fact, the offside flag is up in any case for the forward pass from Kane to Fordham. Yeah, it's just purely instinctive from Harry Kane, he's done the tracking back, he's done the dirty work for the team, he's picked up the ball and he's gone in behind to Fordham, who'd made the run, and Fordham just doesn't quite time it, unfortunately Saka slipped at the backstick, but he was offside anyway. We've got Izzy Christensen and Conor Cody, England, internationals both, up here with us in the five-life commentary position. Conor, we've played ten minutes now, we're all keen to see what England would do, how they would look, what do you think? I think they've started fine, I think they've controlled the game, we've just got to be careful just losing the ball, they've been a little bit of anxiety when the ball gets into... Here we go. Stojanovic down the right-hand side, takes on Trippia, Stojanovic is able to turn, keep possession, close Slovenia, and then Turing goes back into his own half to the number 21, Drakusic. Now again, they've got Stojanovic and Karnecic neat together on the right-hand side, and Stojanovic takes it up to the edge of the penalty area, Šporas pulled away, Šporas ball into the box, it slipped away from Reis, but Gallagher was there, covering behind him, and Gallagher, left-footed, was able to clear it. And the two matches so far, England have taken the lead in both matches, so yet to be behind at this tournament. And Slovenia, even though they are technically the outsiders in this group in terms of their world ranking, I think it is a misleading world ranking, 57 in the world, and as we keep saying, it was only a couple of weeks ago that England lost to the team ranked 72 in the world, Gay with the ball, half-way inside his own half. Trippier calls for it, Trippier gets it. There's a little bit of a concern about Trippier's fitness in advance of this, but Garasovic said he's absolutely fine, so Trippier gives it to Foden, then back to Trippier, again, who looks up, just rolls it to the feet of Gay. The ball has spent a lot of time in this match so far with the England central defenders, whistles from the Slovenian supporters. Gay now through the middle to Harry Kane. Once again in a deep-lying position, Kane gives it to Gallagher. Gallagher eventually gets there with the pass through Walker, then back to Conor Gallagher, again, John Stones calls for it. Stones begins to have a wonder forward, just forward of the centre-circle he is, Šesko though forces him to pass the ball to Trippier. Now he is belting him again, appearing on the left-hand side. This performance, England, lots of possession, but there is not the zip there yet that I think they and the England supporters would want to see. Gay now across towards Stones, and then Kyle Walker, again, just takes the ball back towards the halfway line, and then Declan Rice, and this is very safety first football from England, trying to find the opportunity, Foden now moving in field, Rice, he looks up, it goes square, Walker, Stones thought about the long pass, then it's gay again, I mean, talk about passion, this is extremely patient. Do you know what they're waiting for? They're waiting for a Slovenian player to jump out of the structure, but they are being so disciplined, England are just waiting and waiting and waiting, and you can see they're getting increasingly frustrated, Harry Kane's dropping deep, Conor Gallagher's tight in next to Declan Rice. So therefore the same pattern continues, England, nil, Slovenia, nil, England, after the disappointment of the second match against USA and Qatar, bounced back with a very good 3-0 win against Wales. That was a very powerful challenge, thereby big be all to take the ball, put the tackle in on Conor Gallagher, throw into England, Stones, long right footed pass, that's over the head of Trippie, and out of play, hear the reaction there from the England supporters, cheers from the Slovenians, Conor. Yeah, John, the way you used before, Zip, I think we need to move the ball quicker, I think there needs to be a little bit of pressure on the ball when you're zipping it in, put it with a little bit of a punch on it, just to move them a little bit more. They're comfortable in the shapes, they're actually doing it really well, they're shuffling across the pitch really well, we're getting movement quite nicely, but just that little punch on the ball, I think we need to get it a little bit quicker. Yeah, the talk yesterday, Declan Rice said to me, we want to dominate teams. But at the moment, it's the gentlest of starts, nil, nil, in both matches tonight, so it's as you were, England would be going through as group winners. Stones. Sheshko with the press on him, back to Pickford. Pickford left-footed to Tripier. Down there, all in black, Matjes Kek, the Slovenian coach, very experienced in his second spell as the coach of the Slovenian team. It was him who was in charge back in South Africa. Oh, John Stones, that's a poor touch from him as the ball is played across to him. Miscontrolled and it's out of play and I'm afraid that doesn't help the collective. Strange because we're not in Frankfurt now where the pitch was chopping up, the pitch looks OK out there, but John Stones had a little look to the floor, maybe there is a little divot out there, but the ball's just gone under his foot, that's so uncharacteristic of John Stones. Yeah, it was, and that will give confidence to Slovenia. Sheshko, now to the left-hand side where Malacca wins the throw in, and then the left flank, Sheshko tall. He's got that blonde hair, that bleach blonde hair, and he's putting himself in a position at the near post. Sheshko signed a contract to stay at Leipzig despite the interest from Arsenal. Throw-in is taken short by Slovenia out towards the left-hand side, back it goes. Here's the cross into the six-yard box, over everyone. And then Pickford came, but no-one could get a touch, and it's all the way through for a goal kick, and it is still 0-0 with 15 minutes play. Yeah, it's good marking at the back post from Trippery, he just gets in there before Shepora, he just gets his body in the way and just guides it away, and Pickford comes out, I think England got full control of that situation, but might be better to ask an England centre-back. I was going to say, is he Trippery? He's the best at that, honestly. His dark heart with defending, the way he can get his body in, and just after the ball-out of play, he's the best at doing it, it was a fantastic bit of defending. Yes, that Diego Simeone, he taught him a thing or two when he was at Real Madrid. Trippery, now to Bellingham, and Bellingham attacks, runs with the ball at the Slovenians. Now Gallagher with a little touch, Saka could be on to this in the penalty area, here he is. Right-footed cross, though that's over, everyone's fraud and anticipated, though, that it was going to bounce out into the right-back area. And for the first time in the match, Trippery, that was a poor challenge, but the referee's waved the advantage. Spora takes it on for Slovenia down the right-hand side. I think there might be a yellow card coming for Kieran Trippery after that challenge, but still the Slovenia attack continues, Spora looks across it, then it's blocked out of play by Gallagher, and yeah, Clemente-Pan points at Kieran Trippery, and it's a yellow card for the England left-back. Yeah, it was really late for Kieran Trippery, he's just trying to cut off that Slovenian counterattack at source. But they do really well to progress the ball down this right-hand side, and they look like they're growing in confidence, Slovenia, like moving the ball about one-two touch, and they've got themselves in a really good position here, with an attacking, I think it's a throw-in on this right-hand side. Or is it a free kick? I think it is a free kick. It might be worth pointing out that there is a possibility that the places could be decided on the disciplinary ranking between the sides in this group, and Denmark, before tonight, had three yellow cards, and England now have two free-kick to Slovenia on the right-hand side. This is going to be taken by Janja, I think. There are two of them there, Janja and Czareen, but I think it looks like the in-swinger from the left-footed Janja. England, got to face this set piece. Nil Nil, if you've just joined us on five-lie here in Kulall. Janja waits, referee just eventually does blow his whistle. It is Janja left-footed towards the back post, and it's over everyone and all the way through beyond the far post on the bounce for a goal kick. It's a wonderful delivery from Janja. The left-back, he's just stepped onto the ball, he's hit it really cleanly, and he's got lucky. So it is a goal kick. Goal kick. Gay left-footed, plays it out towards Foden, a flick with Foden, and then Drakusic is able to play it back. However, so far, the most positive thing England have done was that run from Jude Bellingham. That was the first moment, really, where the crowd, the England supporters, got up as he ran at the Slovenians, and it did result in, what, a quarter chance. It is Elshnik for Slovenia. They've played it up to Spora, who's going to shoot from outside the penalty area, took a deflection, so Pickford, scrambling wide at his goal, was able to get down and hold it. Gay's gone in really well there with Spora. He's recognised that he's just dropped deep. He's tried to get the shot away. It was definitely not enough on it, but it was good by Gay again, just to get tight pressure on him. England nil, Slovenia nil. Let's see how things have started between Denmark and Serbia. A decent start. Denmark targeting, hoiling with their balls forward. Serbia employing the same tactic with Mitrovic. One of Serbia's defenders has already picked up a yellow card, just four minutes in. Milenkovic, and Barra has just had the vibe of Denmark. A draw could be enough for them. It is still nil-nil at the moment. It's as you were in the group. Yesaka playing it into Bellingham, just outside the D with his back to goal. Rice square, now Trippia, Trippia to Foden. For once, Slovenia are being pinned back into their own penalty area. They're just looking to get the ball up about this. Foden, little touch towards the corner flag, then back to Trippia on the left. Trippia then picks out Rice. Rice back to Foden in the box. Foden across, Saka! Offside flag! Puts it in the net with his right foot. It did look it, I must say. One or two water bottles are thrown down. The goal will be checked, but I think it was offside. What do you two think, the professionals? Yeah, we're just looking now. Foden's on the back shoulder and he is. He's offside, but tell you what, that's come from Declan Rice. Conor was asking for zip and clarity on the passing out there. That is a brilliant example, so unfortunate. That's more like it. You move the ball fast, I think, against the 4-4-2, a low block. A team who were together and in contact with each other. You move the ball fast, John, and it moves them. And this England team is capable of punching the passing in. That's one thing to go. When you train with them and you play with them, it's like pinball at times, and I think they need to get to them levels. 20 minutes played. England 0, Slovenia 0, Euro 2024, on the BBC, here on 5 Live, and BBC sounds. And 0-0 after the concomation from VAR. Bellingham dived in rather there, and I think it was just as well. He didn't get a touch on Turin. Dived in with both feet on the ground, and then forward from D-all. Suddenly the intensity is much greater from England, although that's given us a foul against Walker in the centre circle. He just simply looked it to my eye. Yeah, that's just seemed to have given England a little bit of a boost. Ball played forward by Slovenia, but there's no way that Malacca will catch that. It's through for Golcic. Yeah, there's much more energy about it. We've not even mentioned Cowalker then, and he was the one that came in there and conceded the foul, but he went in with real intent into Malacca, the winger that he's up against when he came inside. He just went tight. He ended up giving a free kick away, but that's more like it for Minglen. Don't mind that at all. Golcic then. Pickford is going to take this. He's like a beacon down there, all in orange, almost matching the orangey sunset that we've got here tonight across the city of Cologne. Pickford left footed, high and long. Kane comes, tries to flick it on, but that's one well by D-all. Walker's able to get his foot on the ball after it was headed forward to him. Kyle Walker, the vice captain, winning his 86th cap tonight. Saka tries to get away down the left. He was pulled back there, and it is a yellow card to England. Take a quick free kick, which they wanted to do, but the referee says that he had not given England permission to take it. But that was blatant, the pullback by the left back Yanja on Saka, and so Saka has now got a left back on a yellow card. Yeah, it's brilliant play from Saka. More like it from him. He's off in the Premier League. He's one of the best at receiving the ball in tight spaces and getting out of trouble. First touch just takes him away, sucks in the foul, and you can feel the momentum shifting again in England's favour. There's a bit more bite about them now. And if Slovenia are able to get through, Yanja will be suspended for their match in the round of 16. But no goals yet on this final night in Group C. So England would be going through as group winners to play one of the third-place teams. Walk-up forward, but Gallagher was never going to reach that. He's scored again, Spora, once on loan at Middlesbrough. Andra is Spora, challenging for it. Walker then wins himself a throw-in on the halfway line. If you're out of work late and you haven't heard in the earlier matches, our earlier commentaries, it finished Austria, three Netherlands, two, France won, Toland won, so Austria would back Group. And Austria, both teams going through there, will play one of the runners-up. Austria will play the runners-up in the Portugal group and France the runners-up in the Belgium group. They'll all be decided in the coming days. England nil, Slovenia nil, with Gaye just turning back to Bellingham, who's again over towards the left-hand side, clearly from our position here, see the fashionable holes in the back of his sock. Walker misses the pass, nevertheless it reaches Saka on the far side, then in field towards Foden, Foden, past Tripier. Bellingham's there, just to his left, still on the left flank. Bellingham's ball across, took a deflection, was cleared away on the edge of the box. As Mark Gaye will go back to the goalkeeper. Yeah, I'm just looking at the way that England is setting up and the way that they're moving out of his in possession to try and get the likes of Bellingham and Foden on the ball. And they're playing some really strange passing choices. It's easy for us to sit up here and say that, but Foden, through the middle, doesn't reach Bellingham. So, for Akushic, who's got it in front of his own box, England with Foden and Tripier, but it's played. And in fact, cheers from the Slovenian supporters, as they try to play through the England press, but England are back in position with Saka on the far side, who goes down under the challenge of Janža, who's got to be careful there against Saka. He's played for it and then blasted by stones into the shins of Šesko, and now to play on the far side. He's taking a risk there, Janža. I was going to say, Jon, I keep on giving a ball to Bakao Saka. I really would. You can get at people. And in game management, it's understanding what the opposition are doing. Is anybody on a yellow card? A full-back on a yellow card is really dangerous when you've got someone running at you like Bakao Saka. I keep on feeding him and feeding him and feeding him and trying to get at him and let's see what he does with it. 25 minutes played now as Kieran Tripier passes the ball over the halfway line to Phil Forder. Back to Tripier. Kieran again has dropped deep. He's now inside his own half, the England captain, as he just taps it back again. And then Kieran bring it forward, blocked out of play by Kieran for a throw into England just in front of the dugout. No sign of Garry Southgate down there, sitting alongside Steve Holland out of our sight. Under the top of the England dugout, which looks to me as though it's got the flag of Japan on the top of it, as Stones plays it to the right-hand side to Walker. Now to Saka. Saka just wriggles away from Janja again. Conor Gallagher's made himself available on the right, but the cover was there from Elshenik. And then eventually, Gallagher with Mlaka, and it is given as a free kick against the Slovenian midfielder. So a free kick won by Conor Gallagher. Yeah, that's what Conor Gallagher's all about. He picks up the loose balls, he's happy to take hits and just relieve a bit of pressure. And they've shown, Slovenia have shown some really nice little bits of link-up play. Playing this 4-4-2 system really nicely. Still 0-0, Foden now moving in field again. It's opening up for him to the edge of the area, plays it again, but Kaine was just on his heels there on the edge of the box, as Foden flicked it forward, and it just ran away from him behind for a goal kick. Yeah, Foden just getting on the ball, and he's at least the one he starts to be with there. He sucks the defender out, he tries to slide Harry Kaine in, but it's just a fraction too late from the England captain. So a goal kick to Slovenia, under the path of Walker. Now Bukajosaka, Saka back to Walker, and then across it comes again, Phil Foden, when he's received the ball, Foden, he's very often looked to come in field, and here he is now, Foden. Then back to Trippier, and England back into their own half, where Mark Gay will go back to Pickford. For Foden, the statistics don't look good, one goal and no assists in his last 15 England appearances. But he's always available, he's in the game, stones with it at the moment, plays it to his left-to-game. The England fans urging their team forward, Mark Gay is actually going to bring it forward, here's Declan Rice in that central position. Kaine available, but it goes square to Walker, who's come well in field, Gallagher makes a run to the right-hand side, Saka is there again, Saka's ball, that's more positive, to Kaine inside the box, try to flick it, got it all wrong. Bellingham wins it back on the edge of the area, Bellingham on his left foot, in comes the challenge on him, back to Rice, Rice slides in, Bellingham slides in, England keep possession, Trippie at Foden, in come the challenges, England still in possession. The England supporters like this, there's a bit of the traditional English style of football on that last period of attack, as Trippie out wins a throw-in, Off-Carny, on the left-hand side. Some proper hard tackling in there by Declan Rice, and then the tackle on Bellingham was hard but fair, but the England fans, as you say John, responding to that, they're loving it, the intensity, really lifted it. I can imagine them in the stands, the phrase is like, that's more like it, but Karnicnik is running it away, and England might be a little stretched here, Sesh goes available, the ball is played for, for him to chase, but Tickford will get there comfortably and easily first, and actually is able to pick it up and then underarm it out to Gallagher. Gallagher's got space in front of him, you can hear the England supporters saying, come on, get it forward, which is what they're doing. Trippie out, now Thordan, he's got two Slovenians in front of him, goes back to Bellingham, Trippie out, then Bellingham again, a flick from the right foot of Champions League winner, Jude Bellingham, back to Champions League winner, Kyle Walker, and then through the middle to Declan Rice, he's got space in front of him, to the edge of the box, Kane takes the touch, shoots on the turn, and then goes down a little awkwardly as it's blocked away out towards the left-hand side, Trippie keeps it in play, Thordan now, Thordan, that's a good looking ball, right across the penalty area, and it's lead behind at the back post by Janja for a first corner of the match to England. You can feel the energy transmitting to the fans now from England, they've really turned up the volume, the passing's got crisper, Declan Rice there couldn't believe the amount of space that he found himself in on the half-turn, and it found Harry Kane, and England have got that corner off that cross from Thordan. Yes, after what you have to say has been a tentative start from England, I think the tempo, the intensity is increasing, and it is getting marginally better. Corner from the right-hand side, the Trippie waits to take, the referee blows his whistle, standing just inside the box, Trippie just steps away to the right, and here we are, right footed towards the back post, Kane with the header, didn't get a clean contact on that, headed away into the full-back position, and then Rice challenges for it, bounces down, Rice battling for it, referee says, yep, that's OK, back to Kane, Kane shoots for Goldberg Oblak, is able to catch the ball in front of his eyes, just slightly actually for the left of his head, and that's England's first attempt on Gold. Yeah, and it was the right decision from Harry Kane, he's so lethal on his right foot, Kane from Declan Rice picking up the second phase off the corner, he's mopping up at the back, keeping the attack alive, and that's what the England fans want to see. Getting better, Connor? Yeah, a little bit of bite about England, I think the last five, six, seven minutes, I think we've sustained attacks better, they've had that one little counterattack, that pick for a come-out and collected, but we're just sustaining attacks better, a little bit more bites, a little bit more zip, obviously the shot from Kane, but just building a bit of momentum, it's better for England. Serbia at nil on this Tuesday night, and it passed them to a little short, Forden was almost onto that, in fact England would have won it back, but Kalligas headed it away to Spora, 30 yards out, takes it on, left foot shot, deflected across the box, but took it away from Shesko inside the penalty area, and Tickford was able to collect it under no pressure, so still nil-nil. They've got a threat though, Slovenia, no question. They're just biting their time, Slovenia, two forwards are working really nicely, antagonistically I think is the word together, one's dropping deep, one's going in, and they're just waiting for England to make a mistake, and they're pouncing on it, and they look at threat. Spora, the number nine, who as I say, was at a spell on loan at Middlesbrough, but is now at Tannath and I, Koss and Shesko, who finished the season with Leipzig so well, scored in his last seven Premier League Bundesliga matches of the season. England have taken a while to create a chance, but Harry Kane with that shot from the edge of the penalty area there first, which was easily dealt with by the excellent Oblak. Now Gaye, England, look for Dallingham on the left again, back it goes to Tripier, then for to Kane, and then again back towards the halfway line. I must say this does bring it back to the last Euros, the third group match of England had there against the Czech Republic, which if you remember, was a bit of a tense 1-0 win, but England with that won the group, and then proceeded to reach the finals. So the runners-up, the last time the Euros were played in possession, inside the central third with Gaye, and Gaye looking for options, a little slipped by Foden as he comes for it. Gaye through the middle to Rice, then Foden, Tripier, Tripier expected to go forward down the left, but comes with the ball in field to Foden, Foden with a 1-2 with Dallingham, now Tripier on his right foot, then Rice is found space again, 25 yards out, Rice then runs into trouble on the edge of the box, does well actually to get a touch to it as he fouls. Tripier plays it forward to Foden, he's got space, looks up, left foot at ball to the edge of the box, Walker is there, but Walker lays it off over to the far side, Saka, Saka has to scamper out of the penalty area, and then Saka to Gallagher, Saka takes it on, he's fouled, there's Beale, dives in on him, concedes the free kick to England, probably 25 yards out, given the angle towards the right. Saka just coming inside on that favourite left foot, really clever the way he uses his body, just sucks, draws the foul, and England have got an interesting position here, looks like Foden's going to go over and take it, a favourite left footer position. Strange isn't it, it does feel to me that there is an air of tension about this England performance, even though they've already secured their place in the last 16, you know the players know, it feels like they know that they have to deliver, but this is a set piece opportunity that they have here now, Foden has gone over there, Trippier as well, probably too far out to have a go, but Trippier just placing the ball, Foden, two of them in conversation together, still in discussions, looks as though it's going to be delivered in by Foden, here he comes, Phil Foden strikes it, goalwards and Oblak is able to move across, quickly enough to his left and just padded down. It wasn't a bad effort from Phil Foden, I think the position of the free kick favoured across, rather than a shot, nonetheless he catches it really well, but Oblak was equal to it, just watching Trippier off the transition there, really sharp on it, getting the team organised, that's what England need. Oblak launches one downfield, headed away by Gay, comes to Stajanovic, on the right hand side, Stajanovic just slips the ball down the line to Spora and then Gay into the challenge to win a throw in for Slovenia, ten yards away from the corner flag. Slovenia, take the throw in quickly, the flick in field by Turin, now here is the hulking figure of Dior, the number six who receives it back on the half-way line. Slovenia, never beaten England in the six previous meetings, one of which was in Port Elizabeth, at the World Cup in South Africa, where England went on after that, if you remember, to the match against Germany, Gallagher is challenged and Slovenia did not take advantage of that, there was a mix-up there between Cesko and Malacca, but it is Slovenia who come forward again with the ball from El Sniig, and now Cesko looking to find a position, 35 yards out, rolls it to Stajanovic on the right hand side, Stajanovic with Konicnik, Konicnik pass to Trivia, Konicnik's ball to the near post, his block, Gay was there, Spora as well, and it bounce back to Trivia to clear the ball, back to the edge of the England penalty area, and then Trivia has given it away, Stajanovic approaches the area, there are white shirts there, he's forced a little wide, he uses Konicnik, who gives him it back, Stajanovic right corner of the box, and this time it's England, who are having to defend here, as the Slovenian confidence draws Konicnik, still 0-0 in both of these matches tonight, so England going through as group winners with this scoreline, but again, it is less than wholly convincing this England performance. Here's Elshnik, Elshnik moves forward, Saka forces him to turn it back to Drakusic on the half way line, then Konicnik again, Konicnik, Elshnik, it'll pass forward from him, then it comes back to him, Bellingham tries to get there, body language not great from Bellingham, as he doesn't get there, looks to the heavens. I was saying how the Slovenian strikers are working together, it's not the same to be said for Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham at the moment, they're being topped around and you can tell they're getting frustrated, understandably. Elshnik now down into the full back position, Stajanovic, this is good from Slovenia, they sense that there is this vulnerability about England. Šporra, Vektikonicnik, now it's taken up, certainly by Čareem, the Slovenian supporters, roaring on their team, Stajanovic is called Čareem with the cross, high towards the back post, it's very congested there, Saka leans into his opponent who goes down, Malaka went down far too easily, the Slovenians are appealing for a penalty, I think they'll be very fortunate, and then Harry Kane is felled from behind by Bial, which is far from his first fell, and the England captain has stayed down. Yeah, there's two bits in there to dissect, one the defensive responsibilities from Bakao, we're just watching a replay, he's gone down far too easily from Janza, it's not a foul, Saka's done really well, and then that one on Harry Kane, by the way, Afanasi-Elecard from Bial, the centre-back who's gone right in with him, gone through the back of him. Me too. And Harry Kane is on his feet now, and Harry Kane trotting towards Referee Töpan, and I think he's making the same point as the captain. What about a booking for Bial for that? Gay hits this long pass downfield, I'm not sure Bellingen will get there, he doesn't and Bellingen drops down and slides through, actually on his knees, he then stands and plows back towards the England players on the halfway line for the intent. Conor, have you put in that challenge that Bial had on Harry Kane? I'd have been booked, 100% I'd have been booked. It was a book, the second one he got away we were on the edge of the box as well, when Phil Fould, nice free kick. We're in our final fade, we seem a little bit passive, we seem a little bit passive, we get into the byline a little bit too easy in that little pattern of play there, we rescued it, but can we be a little bit more aggressive? Can we make contact on the play-roader, man? Yeah, there's trivia heads back to Pickford. And the shout for the penalty from Slovenia, I mean, Saka had his arms around Janja, but I think released his hands at the crucial moment. It's a great bit of defending, it's exactly what you want from your winger, coming back in, helping you back four, well done, well done Bukhaj, brilliant defender, mate. So England, play it forward, half-time approaching, 0-0 in both matches this final night in Group C. Five life from the BBC, flood lights just beginning to take greater effect down there on the pitch surface, Foden. Then Stones from his Manchester City team there, flick from Trippia, Dalingham's able to get the ball down on ground level, and then takes on the two Slovenians, plays it back to Trippia, Trippia on his right foot. from Trippie at the back post and it just evades both Gallagher and the sliding Kane and skips away beyond the far post for a goal kick. It's taken 40 minutes for us down this left-hand side to find Keir and Trippie in his strongest position, cutting on to his right and he whips the most delightful ball into the backstick area and Harry Kane must have been inches away from that. He was, we're watching the replay there but that ball in from Trippie, exceptional. It's an outstanding ball, John, outstanding. Keir and Trippie has got that in his locker-ball away. We see it every single week at Newcastle from the right-hand side. He just put it onto his right foot and whipped a lovely ball in. All it needed was a little, little touch and it'll go into the bottom corner. But it remains 0-0 and Mark Gay gets very tight on Sporagh down in the halfway line, way down below us. Have to lean over the front of the desk to see him. Sheshko and then Karnicnik with a ball into the edge of the arrow. Walker's got to be careful, quickly plays it back to Pickford. He was under pressure there, Walker, on the edge of the area. It was a sure touch. You got that just about right. Yeah, he did and I'm just watching Pickford and Walker. Walker's just clapped Pickford because Walker deals with it really well. He fizzes a pass into Pickford and he has to deal with it first time otherwise he's under pressure but they ended up dealing with it really well England. Well, it's been an ultra low-scoring group this one. 1-1-1-1. 1-0-1-1. And this last night of the group has them both at 0-0. Here is Jude Dillingham. Dillingham to Folden. Now back to Gay. In England again, Conor Gallagher makes himself available but instead it goes to Rice, Declan Rice. Gay and the England supporters. You can hear them from the stands. There are so many of them, almost 20,000 of them in this stadium. Whenever England are in a position where they could drive forward there is that encouragement from the stands and here it comes again. Rice though has to go back to the halfway line. Two John Stones and then Harry Kane. Once more drops deep. Stones to Kane who turns now that he odds out. Kane's going to try shot which is deflected up and wide. Luke's away to Conor for England. Don't mind that. The obvious pass for England is to play sideways but what they've started to do in the last five or ten minutes, they've started to pierce through Slovenia's midfield. They're getting Harry Kane, Declan Rice on the half-turn and then they're just going for the throat of Slovenia and they've got a couple of corners as a result. It's much better from them. Simple. So Trebja goes across there to take this. Luke Shaw is named as a substitute by the way tonight. He was involved in the warm-up but Garry Southgate said he won't be on the field tonight but that is more promising. Here's the corner then. Trebja drives it deep. Rice trying to get to it. There's Defender there in the referee says there was a shove in the back on Cherine by Rice. So it's a free kick and Beal gives him a little hug for winning the free kick. Free kick to to Slovenia. So nil nil in both matches and Oblak who's not being stretched. It has to be said he's had a couple of stops to make but for goalkeeper at his level they were very straightforward and Oblak with the orange gloves and the orange boots strikes us over the halfway line. It bounces down for Trebja and then Trebja all the way back to goalkeeper Pitford who will give it back to Trebja. That's what England want to see just as Izzy Christensen described there. To be able to find a position where Trebja can deliver balls into the penalty area from open play. Walker then Gallagher. What do you think of Gallagher so far Izzy? It's been energetic. He's made a few good forward runs which we haven't mentioned off the ball but I've noticed him. He's doing it to create space for the team but I think it's been a few sloppy little bits of play in the midfield for him. He's on the ball now. First time he started a match at a major tournament. There's an unused substitute for all of the matches in Qatar. He has game not game on the halfway line but Slovenia just happy to sit off behind the ball with this score line Slovenia would be would be risking it in terms of the the places but I think they're probably confident enough that three points will get them through. Here is again. Stones. Stones is saying the game. You know there's body language again out there between the players as Foden brings it in field of rice. Rice goes for the long pass. Walker has to back away not a ball back to Saka. He gets there first ahead of Mlaka. Saka against Mlaka. Saka's ball into the area to Bellingham. A flick from him in between Saka and Foden and it breaks down. Just doesn't click for Infen. It's been the story hasn't it? That's what we're waiting for. We're just waiting for that piece of quality. That's far like Sejong. Yeah, piece of quality and there are plenty of players down there who are good enough to provide it as the referee has blown for half time. 45 minutes are up. He's played five seconds over the 45. So what do we make of that? 0-0 with Slovenia at half time. Is he Connor? I think if I'm honest I think we were expecting a little bit more of a response from England to the previous two performances in the group. But they've just not quite found that cutting edge yet to cut through Slovenia who have been magnificent by the way. They've been structured disciplined haven't they Connor? Yeah, they have isn't. Do you know what? It seems a bit like an anxious performance from England. They get into the final 30 in our own final 30. It's a little bit anxious. I don't know whether it's the crowd and the anxiety in the crowd and then the players and a few little mistakes here and there. I think we have a little bit more quality going forward. We mentioned in comments today we're busy about just being a little bit quicker when you're passing. A little bit zippier. Just a little bit more coming over the second half and try and get away from the anxiety that we've got about us at the minute. Yep, they promised more. Really, they've yet to deliver it. Kane with a shot that was comfortably saved. Fung with a free kick. That ball in from Trippian. Slovenia carry a threat but at halftime England nil. Slovenia nil and Mark Chapman's up here with us. Can I focus on the two flags? And I'll start with you Connor on the right flank, which is, as you said, midway through the first half. Get the ball to it. Get the ball to sack it. He is the one that he's going to run at them. That's exactly what I'll be saying on the pitch. Chappers and I think it's, it's up to players on the pitch then to take responsibility and say, listen, game management, let's see what they've got. Let's see what Slovenia have got. Right, we've got one of the fastest wingers in the competition. He's had an outstanding season. I'll give him the ball, get down the outside. Like the goal in the first game against Sabia, he's got a bit of a spin there. He's got a bit of a spin there. I know it takes the deflection on to Jude Bellingham's head against Sabia, but he's down the outside. He's getting a ball in with his right foot. At the minute, we're always coming inside. We're coming inside. We're coming inside. And on the left, I feel a bit fulfilled, Foden, actually, because he has had a bit of a spark and anything he's tried, it doesn't feel like anybody else is on his wavelength. But I think that's the reason why Jude Bellingham is coming over onto this left hand side as well as Foden. They're obviously trying to get them tight together to combine, to create the overload, to then pierce through Slovenia's defense. I have no issue with that as long as it's got rhythm, as long as it's got intent. And I think the movement between the two of them has just been a little bit delayed and the passing opportunity has gone. But the other thing with Tripp here is obviously he's a right footed left back at the moment. I have no problem with him playing there if you use his strengths. And they've shown there, England, that one chance that Harry Kane was about an inch away from putting in the back of the net. That's using Tripp's strength in a position which isn't his most favoured position. But it's just about finding the right relationships around the ball. And if I'm honest, I don't think it's working on this left hand side. Do you think Bellingham's body language is great? I mean, I don't want to go back to it, but it was highlighted in the last game. He did applaud the long ball from Mark Gay. There's a lot of shrugging, huffing, hands out. Why wasn't that laid back to me? The intent is there from Bellingham at times. I wouldn't say it's been consistent. As in he's made the runs beyond, which is what number 10 should be doing. They should be creating space. But I think that the body language you're referring to is coming from the press. Slovenia have looked really comfortable playing out of England's press with with Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham as a two up there. They're just not getting close enough. And that's why Bellingham is getting frustrated. Yeah, it's frustrating, I think, Chappell as well. I think it's frustrating. We're a little bit slower, a little bit lethargic. And I just think it's frustration from Jude. Listen, the bigger things we can look at at this moment. And I actually think I mentioned before again about Declan Rice being big. I actually think he's going to be big in this game without touching the ball that much. I think our centre are asking Steppenmore. They're playing with the two and they're trying to stop Declan get on the ball. So Declan has to move their two strikers because we have two fantastic players at centre back who can step in with the ball. So I think Declan's going to be big in this, getting on the ball when we can, of course. But then when we can't, go and occupy defenders and let us step out in the way. Joe Hart and our studio in Berlin. What have you made of that first 45? Yeah, it just felt a little bit clunky, especially when we're talking about our left side with Jude Bellingham dropping into the kind of left back position here in Trippier. Not quite sure what, when to go, when not to go and Phil Foden, obviously, you can tell that he really wants to make an impact on this game. But, you know, as he said, when he does try and make that impact, not everyone's quite on his wavelength. So I concur with what all you guys are saying. I'm just interested. How's the pitch looking? Because I know that Slovenia aren't necessarily playing slick football, but when they do play, they look quite comfortable in what they're trying to do. But England, they look like a second guess in their simple passes at the moment, and they're not quite sure of the tempo to pass at. Pitch is looking fine to me. Really? Yeah, there was that pass that John Stones, the ball went under his foot and he looked at the turf as if to say it took a bubble. I didn't see it again. I didn't see it close enough. But from my angle, if Slovenia can play, so can England and kind of said it's spot on, absolutely spot on, they just need to move the ball quicker, visit in, get some more rhythm on the ball because Slovenia are just so happy sitting off, aren't they? Yeah, I'd say there's no set tempo to how we're playing. And when a team that wants to play and break through lines, you know, even sometimes we all miss a pass. That's not a problem. It's just I'm not quite sure of the tempo, you know, and it almost looks completely different from the right side, how the pace we're trying to build up to the left hand side. Party. We've all been there, haven't we? You know, we're confidence, mate. I think it's something where we can talk about the pitch, we can talk about the things I want. I actually think there's a lack of confidence a little bit with England. I think you can say what you want over the last few days about the not felt it. But you do, we've been there, haven't we, where you're here, thinking you see it. Of course you do. And there is an anxiety when the ball's coming into our own final third. So I do think it's a confidence thing. We've got to be brave enough and strong enough to get through it. And I think actually, Slovenia are playing quite well. So we've got to get through it and be strong enough to come through it. They have played quite well, haven't they? I'm there, Joe Slovenia. But when England are on the front foot, when they have driven at them those two or three times, and when they have played the pass to break the line, rather go side to side, they've been effective. Yeah, I think Slovenia have fed off our energy, and they've probably fed off everything going into this week, feeling no in full well what noise has been going on from the country and how the boys have been reacting to it. And I was just thinking before about this tournament, obviously, being so close and, you know, no games really, anyone's been blown away. You're not beating anyone in the tunnel at this tournament, are you? You're not standing there and having the opposition look at you and think, this is going to be a long day. I think at the moment, people have got the attitude of, you know what, if we can really get into these guys, we can unsettle them. And I think Slovenia, like we say, we've got to give credit. They've made it really difficult tonight, and they actually look a threat when they go forward. Joe Hart, Izzy Krishnis and Conor Cody with us this evening. Goal is here between England and Slovenia. And then the other match in the group, Maz Farouki. Yeah, this one hasn't sparkled really very much either, Mark. This one also goalless. Jonas Fin has had the ball in the back of the Serbia net, but to say he was wrestling Rykovich, the Serbia keeper to the ground as Ericsson swept the corner kick in. Will be an understatement. Ericsson has had a couple of chances testing the goalkeeper, taking a shot on from distance as well. And bookings, if they do become a factor with this group, so tight, we've had two for Denmark so far to add to John's tally, one for Serbia. A draw at the moment could be enough, perhaps should be enough for Denmark to progress, but you feel they want to try and get the job done in the second half. Serbia need to try and get the win. Remember, hard time in Munich and is Denmark, no Serbia, no second half of both games on the way during hard time. We'll discuss the fact that Austria have topped their group this afternoon. The French finished second. The Dutch will go through as one of the best third place sides. First of all, Dan Morsley in the news. The voice of the UK and the home of the Euros and the general election 2024. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Labour has suspended one of its candidates after hearing from the gambling commission that he's being investigated. Kevin Craig has apologised for betting that the Conservatives would win the seat that he's contesting. Well, the Conservatives withdrew support for two of their candidates this morning, Craig Williams and Laura Saunders are being looked at by the gambling watchdog for alleged bets on the data of the election. They've denied wrongdoing. The Metropolitan Police says five more officers based in Westminster are being investigated by the gambling commission for similar allegations. And that may not be the end of it. Here's our political editor, Chris Mason. Here we are so close to the election. I thought I couldn't be surprised by politics anymore. After what we've seen in the last couple of years, frankly, what we've seen in much of the last decade. And then you get days like today where we seem to be well into the kind of you couldn't make it up territory. And here is the thing. There is every prospect that there is more to come. And what are we just a week and a couple of days away from polling day? It's astonishing. Well, indeed, there is more to come because we are now hearing a fifth Conservative is being looked into by the gambling commission over a bet about the timing of the election. Russell George, who's a member of the Welsh Parliament has stepped back from his party's shadow cabinet and says he will cooperate fully. Police in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi have shot dead at least five people during huge protests against planned tax increases. The crowds broke through police cordons and set fire to part of the country's parliament building. About 40 people are being treated in hospital. And North Yorkshire police say four men have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass at Rishi Sunak's home in Kirby-Sigston, near North Allerton. They were detained within a minute of entering the grounds and remain in police custody for questioning. England Nails, Slovenia Nails, here in Cullness, also a Denmark Nail Serbia Nail. England would go through as group winners. Great game earlier. Austria beat the Netherlands 3-2. So they finished top of group D. France drew one all with already out Poland, which means they finished second in the group. The Netherlands go through as a best placed third team and they could meet England, if England were to win the group. That's one of the possibilities now for England. But let's talk to what of his goalkeeper, Daniel Batman, who has got 40 caps for Austria. Evening Daniel, we spoke before that first game against the French and now three games later Austria go through as group winners. Was that how you envisaged it? Yeah, I mean it's one of those, isn't it? Before the Euro's when the groups came out, I don't think many people would have given Austria a really good chance to go through. And I don't think anyone would have thought that they could possibly top that group. So it obviously speaks for the work that Proudfranek's done and also for the effort the players have put in. They've just played some really good stuff in all three games, even in the defeat to the French, they caused the French some problems. And the Poland game was fantastic. And today? Yeah, I think the French result was a bit harsh in the end really because other than the chance in the second half that Bapu missed when he was through on goal, I don't think they had any other clear cut chances. Austria obviously had a massive one just before France scored the goal. If Austria scored that, you know, it's probably a different outcome to the game as well. So given France a really good game, obviously I wouldn't say battered Poland, but they gave them a good seeing to. And then obviously today again against the top team, like we spoke a few days ago, obviously they beat Germany not that long ago and then another big sculpt for them today, going into the round of 16 as a group and as one of the toughest groups at a championship. Do you think they do you think people now treat them differently? And how do you think that will affect them as a group? Because it can't be dark horses anymore. Can they? No, I just think I don't think it'll affect the players at all. I just think because of the way they play, their best attribute is the pressing and the high intensity. So there's not too much that can go wrong when it comes to the playing with the ball. And obviously they've got quality players and they play some great football. But the biggest problems for the opposition teams is the high intensity and the pressing. So that's not really something that can be changed by pressure or by having a different goal now. You know, now you're out of the group stage with such an impressive run of games as well. I don't think that that'll phase them at all, regardless of what's obviously coming from the press. And of course, there'll be conversations. I mean, I don't know if they could go all the way, which I think they can. It's early to say, but just from watching the three group games, I don't think any team will want to play them. Just a final one on it as well. And I think this, while Ralph Ragnick has said this, they don't play until July the second in Leipzig. So July the second is next Tuesday, I think. So they've got a week to prepare for their last 16 game. But given how he works them, given the plans, given the fitness, that gap is huge for them. Yes, it's massive for them. I mean, I think he made a few changes today on the game. He's obviously arrested a couple of players. And now, like you say, he's got full week for them to recover because the way they play is intense and it is incredibly hard work. And you have to be incredibly fit to be a starter in a team or to be involved in that team as an outfield player. So to have that extra week now, that full week of recovery before the last 16 game, was to send them in really good stead going forward just because of the way they play. And that's their identity and they can rely on that next Tuesday knowing they're not going to be tired. Daniel, thank you very much. I just want to bring Joe Hart in. England are out and they're going to make a change, Joe. That was Daniel Batman, by the way, Austria goalkeeper. Kobe Mane, he's going to come on for Conor Gallagher here. Does that make sense to you? Yeah, I think it's something that the team will be looking forward to and that's a really forward thinking move. Joe, thank you. We will see you later. Surprised me. I didn't know that was happening. What, me talking to you or the sub? The sub? I was just going to tell you. You're in the cloud there, big man. Miles away, Miles off it, sorry. We'll send you back to your own little world, Joe. We'll see you later. Joe Hart with us. So that is the change. Kobe Mane on for Conor Gallagher. I'm sure we'll get the thoughts of Izzy and Conor very shortly after John. Yeah, in fact, let's do that because Slovenia just about to kick off. What about that? We weren't necessarily expecting that, were we? I mean, Conor Gallagher could have an issue, of course. Yeah, I think Conor Gallagher struggled to get in the game, but I mean, I like it. I like it. I think, you know, a lot of England fans have been calling for Kobe Mane to come in because of the way the season that he's at it, Manchester United and the dynamic kind of nature of his game and see how that affects Declan Rice as well. And maybe this is exactly what England need. Conor? Yeah, I think it's a sign of intent, John. I really do. I think it's a sign of intent from the manager that he's not happy with the first half. I think it's a sign of intent to put Kobe in and this needs a confident boy. We've watched him play for Manchester United all season. He doesn't seem very similar to Marguerite. Anything really affects him. So hopefully he can get in the ball here, make it tick and get the balls different for England. Yeah, it's loading a lot onto the shoulders of the 19 year old that he is coming on as a substitute, as he did in the first match against the Serbs, but England NIL, Slovenia NIL, referee Clemence Erpant is just about ready. He's waiting for the nod. Both matches are level at 0-0. Neither of them has lit up this German summer evening, certainly judging by what we're hearing from Maz, but it means that England would be going through as group winners Denmark in second and Slovenia as one of the third place sites and we're still waiting. There we are. There's the whistle. I guess they probably had to wait till the match began, began the other match between Denmark and Serbia. That's what they were waiting for. So finally we're underway. In fact, they haven't started yet, so they weren't waiting for that. I don't know what they were waiting for. Anyway, we're underway. England with Pickford in goal, Walker, Stones, Gay and Trippia, and now Cobbie Mayn who into the midfield alongside Rice, Saka, Ballingham, Forden and Kane. So Slovenia as they started the match are parked inside their own half. All black, the goalkeeper, made a couple of saves, but straightforward saves. Karnicini got right back, Drakusic, Biol and Janža the back, Stajanovic on the right, Čareen and Elšnika in the middle, Makar on the left and then Šporra and Šesko, who had one header. Pickfords really had next to nothing to do and very comfortably saved that header. And that match, the other match is underway now. Here comes Forden for England, Ford through to Rice. Now out to the left-hand side to Trippia, Tudelingham, there are England flags draped in every little corner of this Cologne stadium, all around the side of the pitch, but from the Slovenian section as well, where they're here in great numbers, around about 9,000 of them as Cobbie Mayn who gets his first touch now. That's a shewed, back to the halfway line to Mark Gay, Gay and Trippia makes himself available on the left-hand side, Forden, Trippia points forward, Forden, but Forden moves in field, Cobbie Mayn who number 26 on his back, Declan Rice comes short, then to the left-hand side, Dalyngham is there, Dalyngham turning up against Karnicini, slips the ball to Mayn who plays it back behind Trippia and Trippia just does that calm down motion with his palms of his hands. Dalyngham again on the left-hand side, Dalyngham, Dalyngham dummy to cross, then carries the ball into the central area, but turns and gives it back to Trippia, they want him to get it on his right foot, but just got it caught up underneath his feet and it's very very static again, Forden, now to Dalyngham, Trippia couldn't find the pass and now Slovenia will break away with a ball centrally, Walker tried to get there but the cover was there actually from Pekajosaka in the end, so England in the all-white kick with the blue stripe down the sides against Slovenia who are all in royal blue tonight, Saka, Saka goes between two Slovenian players, that's a heavy touch by Kane, bounces off Shevchuk, then back to Kane who actually plays it between his two central defenders in England, then going all the way back to Pickford. Yeah what Slovenia are doing is exactly the same as what they did in the first half, they've got two banks of four and they're two strikers, they're being relatively passive with their pressure and when the ball goes central into the likes of Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, that is when Slovenia get tight, they push and they try and force England into mistakes. The cream shirted Gareth Southgate is there standing on the edge of the coaching area having made his first change, he's not made the full five substitutions in either of the matches so far, England with Forden again on that far side, rolls it across to Saka, he's quite central actually, then Bellingham helps it on to Walker and Saka's continued his run, he gets a blatant shove in the back but keeps his feet Saka and is able to find the pass to Manu, Manu then into Bellingham, inside the penalty area defenders are there, Bellingham keeps possession and actually sees that it takes a touch off the defender and it's behind for Kona. Yeah it's brilliant from Bakayo Saka again, Kona we're saying at halftime, we've got a pump the ball out to him, his full back is up against his on the yellow card and that is what England are doing, and it's Koby Manu finding himself in an advanced position, he just plays a cheeky little pass inside to Jude Bellingham in England, get the corner. It's taken quickly and short by Trippia to Forden, then Manu, Forden wanted it back from Manu but he went in field on Manchester United Youngster, then Rice with the ball into the area, Kane heads it square, thought he might have gone for goal there, Kane in amongst the crowd of players, Slovenia clear it, Walker couldn't find the pass, was looking for Saka, probably the right intention, however bounces to Manu, Manu couldn't get past his man, Forden, all lovely footwork from Forden, little ball to his left to Jude Bellingham, now Trippia is there, Rice, then Manu, first time touch from him, Bellingham central almost found a way to, Kane, Sheshko chess sit down, this is good pressure from England at the start of the second half, Gay beats Spora quite comfortably, excellent work, once again from Mark Gay one of England's best players at this tournament, then Saka, Kane on the right in the area with the cross that is slid behind, for a corner to England from the right, Mark Gay you tell you what, we spoke about in pre-match about how confident and assured he looked, but my word that was classy from him, just setting England back up on the attack in another corner for them, Five Live, BBC sounds, that's where you find us, this European Championship all over Germany, bringing you the commentaries which are at the heart of what we do, every match is live and tonight here in sweltering Cologne, there's Mark Chapman and this has gone with Trippia to take the corner deep towards Kane who heads it across the box and then that's cleared up in the air, still in the box, headed away by Drakusic then fired back in from Foden, but through a crowd of players it was bouncing wide anyway and a goal kick, that's a pressure Konakodi, yeah good pressure, who has started the second half really well on the front foot trying to play in the opposition half which are really live and just being patient, be a little bit patient, can we force it out wide a little bit to Vakaio just to get in 1v1, but it's a better start the second half England nil, Slovenia nil, so Kobe menu on at half time, I notice there are 10 players in the England squad who've not got under the field yet, whereas the Spanish having made all of those changes yesterday, they've used everyone but the third choice goalkeeper, he has rice, that's the luxury isn't it of getting you two wins early, nil nil here, nil nil in the Denmark Serbia match as Kyle Walker carries it forward, so the table in this group it changed time and again in the earlier matches when I was listening earlier to Lee Blakeman and Stephen Warnock with a commentary on the exciting Netherlands Austria game, that group changed all the time, this is static which reflects the level of full mouth entertainment in these two matches, England six minutes into the second half, here's Foden, Foden and back to Stones, Mark Gaye who will be doing his reputation, no harm this young Crystal Palace defender putting his foot on the ball and then chipping it to Walker who is dragging it onto his right foot and playing a little pass forward to Kobe menu, Saka is here as well, back to Walker again in field to Foden in the central area, Foden all very nearly found the ball through to Saka, that's what England are looking for, that killer pass it just hasn't come yet around the edge of the Slovenian penalty area, Rice goes in for the challenge, I think Slovenia wanted a free kick for that, jumped all over Eltschnie, it wasn't given, Rice gets up, he's feeling his back there, I know it's Rice but he's he is back in the action and England with it on the left hand side with Dellingham, now Harry Kane, Kane goes for a high crossfield pass, Walker's in the box, first time volley across but he got that all wrong and all he was trying to do and you might have just heard that the tap of the post by Phil Foden, more frustration for England, yeah it's a wonderful crossfield ball and Cal Walker is the spare man at the back post for England, he can see what he's trying to do, he's trying to we've seen him do it from Manchester City, he's put it back into that six yard area first time to cause issues but he just doesn't execute execute the ball but what I would say John is that breeze inside the stadium is absolutely delightful, that's your classic cooling summer breeze blowing across western Germany, here's Rice inside his own half finding Walker and now it's the Slovenian supporters all jumping up and down, as Kane plays it into Dellingham inside the box, Defender was with him, he took a lovely touch which took it back towards the edge of the box and the and the recovering Beal came in with a challenge which deflected off Dellingham and Dellingham runs to the referee, he's got to be careful because it's the captain who's the only one who can do that but he asked the question and referee turned up and just turned away and said Gulki, yeah it's a proper good 50-50 that between Bellingham and Beal the centre back, yeah but Bellingham does respond, nice turn by Cherine for Slovenia and then plays it just behind Stajanovic on the right hand side and comes the challenge, Slovenia being forced back, this is the press that's been much discussed, there's Kane Leetit and Slovenia go all the way back to Gulki but Oblak, Slovenia just the second time that they've been at the European Championship as Slovenia and they have never reached the knockout stage at either a European Championship or a World Cup, Gay with a nice soft touch there to Trippier on the far side, Sheldon into Manu, the only match that they've won at the Major Tournament was in that group in South Africa when they beat Algeria and then in the third match not the greatest match that was either if you remember Jermaine Defoe scored the winner in England, eventually progressed second place in that group back in 2010, Stones plays it across to Gay now out to the left hand side to Trippier Bellingham then just very casually plays it back to Gay, excellent noise from the Slovenians at the moment, they're winning that little contest between the two sets of fans, they're outnumbered almost two to one, Saka, mind you Slovenia is the smallest country here, just two million people fall out from Trippier to Bellingham, Bellingham lifts the ball to the edge of the box that is headed away from by Biol, one backed by Rice, Rice finds the pass to the England number 10, Jude Bellingham, he's able to turn back and play it to Declan Rice then through to Manu, it's a very firmly challenged that's a free kick, the big number 21 Drakusic just tanked into the back of Kobe Manu and conceded the free kick, he's come right to the back of Kobe Manu there hasn't he, really aggressive front foot defending but England's best moments are coming from second phases, loose balls and that's okay as long as they do something with it and they've got set peace in another good area, we've got just over half an hour to play and still it is deadlock between England and Slovenia, Trippier and Foden, this free kick is over towards the left hand side all of 30 yards from goal with the angle, Trippier on his right foot, Foden on his left, it is the delivery from Foden, Kano know it and just had it away, Biol got to it, played back in by Saka, flicked to the back post, Rice is chasing but it took a touch off a defender's head corner from the left, yeah it's a brilliant defensive clearance from Biol, a centre back for Slovenia, he just gets a nick on it to push it away because Harry Kane is lurking behind him, he was lurking with intent, Foden is going to take this corner, three England players ran the penalty spot, two more closer to the edge of the box, here's the delivery from the corner, from Foden, outswinger Kains after it, it's headed down block by Seshko, not at a cross by Gay, Seshko heads in again, Gay then deflected goal with and the referee has blown the whistle, I think the challenge from Dukajos Saka on the edge of the six yard box, I think he's he's fouled a Slovenian defender and the free kick has been given and it was blocked on the line by Seshko, the initial effort, it was a real scramble and then Saka was going for an overhead kick wasn't he and that's conceded the free kick and he did catch, I think it was Biol wasn't it in the face and no no Sparra it was, Sparra who's just got to his feet, so he's receiving some treatment so let's see what's happening in the Denmark Serbia match, anything like a goal, Lehm has for Ruki. Well Serbia have had the ball in the net John Tadic and Jovic you're on in this second half now combining but not one but two Serbia players were offside so no goal but those two on the pitch now are a reflection of what Serbia know they have to do in this second half try and win to progress the knockout stages it is still though Denmark no Serbia now. So that means England going through as group winners Denmark in second Slovenia in third and England would be playing one of the third place sides very possibly the Netherlands in the round of 16, what about an overview from you Izzy Christensen on on what we've seen so far with almost an hour played. Well we expected a response in the second half I would say I think there's been a slight improvement from the first half performance I think Koby Manu is coming and he's getting in there he's pressing the ball up now and here he is doing exactly that Manu through the cane but running from deep running from almost the halfway line here is Saka Saka then back to Walker Sparra is back on the field by the way I think he just got a little bit of a kick in the face now Saka trying to find it in the area headed away to Cain and comes the challenge on him I think this will roll the way to Kieran Trepia it does in fact Bellingham takes it on gives it to Foden on the left hand side England turning Slovenia back in there they're absolutely dominating the possession Slovenia are not an easy team to find a way through we can see that we know that they're in form one defeat in the last 14 matches Rice though runs on down into the full back position gives it back Bellingham little touch from him to Foden now Koby Manu back to his fellow greater Mancunian Phil Foden Foden with Rice out there as well Rice goes for the long pass across the pitch Walker chests it down to Pukajosaka then back to Walker again England now looking to try and probe on the right there's space here for Foden in the central area but Foden was challenged by Sparra who just got a touch on that England come again though gay with a positive pass now Manu with the cross it's over Cain it'll bounce all the way to Bellingham who allows it to run away into the full back position Bellingham curls the lower one back to Rice Rice onto his right foot Foden on the edge of the area back to Rice again but no again breaks down on the edge of the box and Slovenia look to pray the England support is encouraged by their stout yeah they are but Slovenia is disciplined and how well their coach is really showing in this very moment they're not diving in they're being clean staying structured good possession for England here yeah Manu has definitely brought something to this England performance Walker takes on his defender Walker then to the byline pulls it across but the ball was out before Walker got there even though it was cleared away in the centre and is he okay Kyle Walker did he slide into the Hordens yeah just watching a replay he did a classic kick and run and he's got the pace and I couldn't believe he even managed to get to that ball he's so quick Kyle Walker but yeah his momentum's taking him in almost into the Slovenian fans behind that goal let's bring in Conor Cody again of Leicester City in England in Garra Southgate squad at the last two tournaments what are you thinking Conor yeah it's better John it's better on the front foot we're playing forward we're passing forward I still think we can use the flanks a little bit more with with Saka no Foden's coming on that left-hand side where he likes to play but I still think we can use the flanks outside with Kyle Walker and by Kyle Saka but a lot a lot better on the front foot like I said Mark Gay and John Stone to stay in the tacks and hopefully we keep on going now and take advantage of this yeah Jordan Pigford has barely touched the ball in the second half but he's got it now as he passes it out to John Stones England Nail Slovenia Nail five live from the BBC BBC sounds as well that's where you get the football daily at the Euros all of our podcast offerings many new ones for the Euros as well like you'll never beat Kyle Walker and Wayne Rooney's my Euro 2004 all on BBC sounds here's Saka for England mainly back to Saka on the right he's got a little bit of space here but there's referees brought it back there was that flailing arm whatever it was it's given us a free kick for Slovenia yeah there's a one-two between Bakao Saka and Koby Mano when already you can just see the impact that Koby Mano is having very simple effective football doing a one-two with Saka down the wing and I think the referees pulled Saka back for the trailing arm like you say John on his full back just a bit of wrestling between the two there wasn't much in it and Jan Zsak will be suspended for the next match if Slovenia do get through again the Slovenian supporters trying to do that they're England are attacking towards that end and most of them in the white shirts on this beautiful evening are bouncing up and down in unison as Gay might have been fouled no he wasn't but Stones was there as the covering defender to put the ball out of play and amongst those ranks of England fans and flags on the far side throwing that Slovenia rare foray into the England half and Cherine now into the edge of the Eredish baller Cherine on his left foot got to be careful but it slices it well wide actually it went out of play midway between the goal and the corner play he's shown sparks this tournament Cherine essentially midfielder for Slovenia breaking out of that midfield and into the forward line he's creative he's got confidence to try to shot his left foot but definitely didn't connect with it one at all it remains goalless on this warm evening tough for Slovenia without the ball in these conditions England have made them work Stones taking the ball away from the edge of the England penalty area the England fans now responding with one of their famous chance as you can hear Gay in possession now forward towards John Stones Stones has got Walker available here's Cobby Nainu the young Manchester United man back to the Manchester City defender John Stones squared mark gay gay goes for the long pass towards Walker gets up heads it in field Cobby Nainu slips over but Walker's able but back at Bacchio-Sacar's able to keep possession for England now gay gay through the middle towards Bellingham Bellingham tall statuette to Kyle Walker now to the right hand side to Bacchio-Sacar two men on it Walker's available uses Kyle Walker near the right corner of the box Cobby Nainu's out there as well Bellingham makes a run into the box but still Cobby Nainu with a ball at his feet Kyle Walker behind it Walker Declan Rice is able to get there ahead of Sheshko but then the pass from Rice is one side of Sacar and it will roll all the way through for a goal okay gay it's just lacking that spot that's just lacking that final ball that piece of quality yeah it's just a loose pass from Declan Rice although it's the vignan play who while I was looking at you it's Janja the right the the left back who's now gone down off the field in fact he was shepherding the ball out and Bellingham was chasing it and he's basically making out that he's got a knee in the back yeah he's trying to be clever Janja and trying to keep the referee because it's Jude Bellingham coming at him at pace he's done well to shepherd the ball out Janja and he just feels the impact of Jude Bellingham and tries to come the referee but referees having none of it still nail nail in both matches tonight not sure that this group is going to live long in the memory years to come remember Euro 2024 what happened in that group again we'll have to get the record books out but for England this scoreline means they would be going through as group winners however if Denmark scored that would change things and were Denmark to go one nil up England would drop down to second in the group on the by virtue of the number of goals scored but it is England currently top of the table Slovenia playing the ball back to Björn Harry Paine forces him to hit it long headed forward towards Šesko Slovenia yet to make a change on this warm evening and we are well into the last half hour now match as Keck must be thinking about a change you would think Trippia to Tholdon then back to Trippia and Kieran Trippia just uses cold coldon then Trippia again there's no movement ahead of him so it goes square again the mark gay and then Kyle Walker Sacher on the right hand side Kyle Walker again Slovenia just happy to sit off the ball there will be a 606 by the way to talk about this England performance with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton and the lines I do believe are open on 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 once we've wrapped things up here in Cologne still England in possession by Lowell is telling you that Walker now Sacher Sacher is able to play a ball that's pace yet to came on the edge of the area but B always able to clear it away headed forward by Rice now Fordon to the right hand side Walker is there Harry Kane available on the edge of the box instead it's Maynard square towards Fordon now Sacher in the central area back to Mark gay gay looks up Sacher in front of him left to his right to Rice now Fordon through the middle Fordon wriggles away going into the tight space goes down in between two Slovenian players but referee to the bank is is not giving the free kick and gay now has got to be careful Spora he's pulled him back blatantly Spora goes down Stones was there as a covering defender so it is only a yellow card but that was very very dangerous from Mark gay he's a very lucky boy Mark gay he's been exceptional all tournament but that one there he's just let Spora pick up the loose ball and he's had to tug him down he's pulled his shirt the referee's seeing it because Sacher was away and he had his strike partnership sheska right up there with him that was that was Dyson the danger corner Cody yeah John yeah it was and it was a miscommunication in the middle of pitch from John Stones and Mark gay and I think Mark my gay thought John Stones was going to take charge and vice-versa is tough but you've got to stay switched on at all times these are a tough team to beat on the counter that's the only time they're going to hate us John on the counter attack that's the only thing they're going to do so we have to make sure that we stop the counter attack from Slovenia well well I have news that I think will be welcomed by the England support as Cole Tama is going to come on as a substitute for his first taste of action at this tournament Garry Southgate is speaking to him but it's a free kick to Slovenia first of all there's no court well there is a correlation between the decibel levels in here with the England fans and that man there down down there Cole Tama getting ready to come on because they've seen that they're responding to that they know that he could be the man that unlocks this match for England yeah they've been itching for him to be giving an opportunity we didn't see him in the first two matches there was a little bit of talk that maybe there was a an injury issue however free kick for Slovenia first of all and Cherine with his right foot this could test Pickford two-man wall the actual fact that he's played in left footed by Janja and Gallingham has gone down inside the box the referee's given the free kick the free kick was over hit anyway and that was a massive wasted opportunity for Slovenia yeah it was a big waste from Slovenia but obviously from an England perspective a really good line Jude Bellingham looks like you might have cocked one there yeah he just ah dear dear he takes some on the front yeah Shpora just catches Jude Bellingham but I think Jude Bellingham has actually gone down a little bit too easily there but nonetheless just relieved a bit of pressure for England well it is a straight swap I think Pukaj Osaka Kona is the man who makes way for Cole Tama coming on yeah I think everyone's excited by Cole Tama and listen I think he's put him on there to get it to get out Janja I think like we said in the first half he's on the booking give Cole Tama the ball and run by the way John the England fans have been incredible haven't he yeah it's uh the the noise levels in here they've had a great day as Jim Bourne used to say in the sunshine of Cologne they'll have enjoyed themselves I'm pleased to say that everything seems to be calm there's there's no talk of trouble which was a big fear but what a cheer that was when Cole Tama's name went up on the board and on he comes this 22 year old who's had a brilliant season the Premier League young player of the season and now he's playing at the Euros for England John Stokes his former teammate he has Declan Rice Tama number 24 in his back it's been a fairy tale style script that he's had this season from the moment he made that move from Manchester City and now he's hugging the touchline on the right hand side as England have possession I think that's the sort of positive move that the England supporters will have applauded from Gareth Southgate but particularly if it does actually come off it's nil nil and it's still nil nil in the Denmark Serbia match so England with these score lines are going through as group winners Declan Rice now to John Stokes he has Tama he has his first touch of the ball from Foden and then Kobimeno as well all of these Mancunians on the field together Kane goes for as Beall and is pulled over Blainley pulled back and Beall surely will be booked for that and also when you think Beall very fortunate not to be yellow carded already and that is a booking for him yeah and he is a very lucky boy Beall the Slovenian centre back he just loses that duel where Harry Kane Harry Kane drives away from him and he chugs him down a little bit similar to Mark Gay earlier at the other end of the pitch but already Cole Palmer's body shape by the way he looks lively dynamic and he just wants the ball at his feet England nil Slovenia nil 72 minutes on the clock and England with this free kick won by the captain won by Harry Kane and standing over the ball Trippie and Foden as the referee marks out the white line so three-man wall has been put up by Jan O'Black O'Black who's just had a couple of routine saves to make so far in this match all in black he's lining up his wall and then moves back into a central position Foden speaks into the ear of Kieran Trippie it's Trippie who's placing it which makes it look like he's going to deliver it to the back post Declan Rice is there just picturing with his shorts he's ready Bellingham's ready as well referee's whistle's gone Trippie with the free kick into the back post Gay heads it back but heads it out of the box but Palmer's the first man there for England and in comes Dracusic with the challenge Throin is taken back for the halfway line by Walker and then Walker Trippie has the furthest outfield player back for England and then Foden and Trippie are actually rolling all the way back for a rare touch again for Jordan Pickford if he keeps a clean sheet tonight Pickford he'll break Peter Shultons record of clean sheets for England at Major Tournament there is a Slovenian change coming presently trying to see who it is but England with the ball on the left hand side Mark Gay Rice drops into the centre circle makes himself available he has Kyle Walker now and Walker sees Phil Foden in a central area Foden then to the far side towards Trippie Colt Palmer stayed out there on the left hand side actually having been out there he takes on his men two of them there and then in comes the in comes the challenge from Sklyanovic to put it out of play Palmer immediately takes the throw back to Declan Rice Rice does well he beats his man now takes on Carnichne then Rice gets it back and shoots across the face of goal as gasps from the England fans at the other end I'm not sure it was terribly close but um but that was better again from England yeah it was a snapshot from Declan Rice he just took it quickly after that little bit of build-up play with himself from Foden finding himself more advanced Declan Rice but I tell you what that's the first time I've actually seen an England wide player in this instance Cole Palmer out on that left hand side actually take his full back on down the outside and all of a sudden it looked like the world had opened up and we had a bit of natural whip and a big cheer from the Slovenian fans Sheshko is off you know he has been carrying an injury so he's been substituted with 15 minutes ago and a massive cheer for Jossip Ilychic who is uh such a favorite was recalled for these euros after a couple of years out of the international picture he's the veteran at 36 years old so the number 26 is on to win his 82nd cap for Slovenia and the England fans respond with the anthem England Nail Slovenia Nail it's a match that is he has not really matched the atmosphere in the stance no it hasn't and I also think the England fans are just applauding the fact that the sun's gone in and they can pull off for a bit still sweltering though they've been unbelievable I like Connor we're saying the noise is incredible yeah they just want a goal in this match two only two goals scored by England in the three matches but crucially only one conceded so far Nail Nail and uh beyond across to Drakusic his pass forward Trippier gets there first heads to the halfway line and then a back heel flick into his into his own half for Drakusic uses Oblak Harry Kane closest to him Oblak's ball to the halfway line Rice has been called over there referee plays the advantage and it's a good advantage as Corden's able to volley the ball lovely touch to Walker now cold Palmer back on the right hand side Palmer lovely ball through Manu across there's no one there played it behind Harry Kane's run but much much better and the excellent pass through from cold Palmer as oh it's a yellow card for Corden for a challenge center field so so Phil Corden picks up a booking that was a cheap one yeah that was cheap but yeah just watching it back it's Dacklin Rice that's doing the sweeping up he causes the foul and I think I see what Foden was booked for then was it a bit of descent perhaps yeah must have been yeah and it was and then you could tell from the way that he sort of flapped his hand there's you know I can't believe you've booked me for that what about the Palmer pass called Connor fantastic passing when England become good and you have a couple of chances it's not it's not difficult play it's quite simple what they're doing it's runs in behind it's lovely passing behind which these players are capable of because they're fantastic players and it's not that hard it's not that difficult so just keep being simple keep forcing the issue and playing them simple passes so it's still 0-0 in both matches stones to Walker now he has called Palmer again he's he's brought a bit of life to this England performance Palmer then chips it forward this is for Kane that was beautifully weighted as well Kane's ball across to the back post is slid behind by Karny Schnee with Foden waiting behind him corner Kane what a run and Foden's coming in at the back post on that far left hand side and Harry Kane looks up and he's only got one place and one person to aim for and he almost finds Foden it's almost exceptional from Harry Kane yeah it's almost as if Harry Kane's saying I like the look of this from Palmer and what he might be able to provide for me Foden with a corner from the left for England high want over the top of stones Kane got his head to it and as a judge to have been fouling his defender and it's a free kick to Slovenia inside their own box there are low fives from the Slovenians they are awkward opponents that unbeaten at the tournament it might be three draws out of three for them but they certainly won't have given up hope of potentially winning this match could be a tense last 10 minutes Connor yeah Cole Palmer's help though John he's helped a little bit of an injection of pace a little bit of authority coming inside playing forward passing forward running forward we know his qualities anyway but he's just give this game a little bit of life I think. Nell Nell as Foden deflects the ball out for throwing on the halfway line more life sport tomorrow so there are two commentary times tomorrow when groups E and F will be decided you'll hear the commentaries with us on five live five o'clock eight o'clock you know the drill by now as the ball is played back to Pickford we'll just pass it out to Walker he's going to just allow the ball to run and then take it away from Malacca and and also tomorrow more cricket commentary feels like a cricket season as the county championship matches will conclude and England New Zealand from one o'clock as well the women's ODI from 1245 on sports extra that's all the life sport tomorrow but now we are almost into the last 10 minutes here forgettable match a wonderful atmosphere Walker on the halfway line Walker to Palmer Palmer turning twisting kicking on Janja Janja did well actually Manu Bellingham Bellingham wants to get into this act with Palmer Manu as well all very close tight quarters and then it's played away but Walker's onto this there's a man down Janja's down again and the referee has stopped play and that was that was very kind of the referee to stop play for for Janja being down it's not a head in two there's no contact there he's gone down I think he's asking for a bit treatment but what he is doing now is he's using game management tactics he's recognized that England just starting to turn the screw it's just stuck in the momentum out of England's attacks this is the benefit here of the I don't know why he stopped playing the first place but the referee is saying to the Slovenian medical people come on then on the field treating and Janja has to get through his feet however it's disrupted the play as you said free kick starts with a drop ball England with these scorelines 10 minutes away from finishing as group winners in not the most wholly convincing style but a group win is a group win I suppose but it can change yet still nail nail in both matches Palmer goes one way the other then beats his man flick from Manu Bellingham on the edge of the box Bellingham works it back and actually Rice loses out in the challenge Slovenia will break as the ball is played out here and I don't think I don't think that was going to keep it in no he's not it's out of play and England are going to make another change and Trent Alexander Arnold as we suspected is he yeah is going to come on as a substitute yeah I had a funny feeling he'd enter the pitch at some point and predicted that he will have an impact as well but we'll see about that but again Cole Palmer getting on the outside of the full back getting the fans off their seats it's what we want to see still no no Palmer though again dangerous ball headed away on the edge of the box I feel like I've said that every time Palmer has been on it you know he's he's already he's already brought a great deal to this this England performance and England fans will be saying where was he here's Bellingham through the middle Bellingham out with the left hand side to Trippia England sending white shirts forward Trippia back to Declan Rice Rice across to John Stones Trent Alexander Arnold standing with Gareth Southgate gets a little pat on the back we will bring you the interviews during 606 as well Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton standing by to take your calls on what you thought of the England performance tonight 08085 909 693 Robbie in the studio the five-life studio Chris here in Germany up in Essen he has Rice Rice's ball air really for Kane to chase bounces into the penalty area Bellingham's there as well Kane has to take it out and then plays it back to Fordham left foot shot from him that's blocked by Elshneak on the edge of the box gain England take up possession Fordham 30 yards from the goal squared towards Walker now here's the danger man Palmer again Palmer taking on Janja onto his left foot ball into the area awkward for Beal just shanks it up in the air headed away by Janja then Slovenia back to the edge of the box where Drakusic just fires it away downfield okay he's got to be careful which he is heads it down heads it down but he's got to play back to Pickford and there was there was a big figure of Ilichich after it and then there's a foul on the halfway line because Janja has won another freaking yeah he's up to all the tricks in the book Janja but I'll tell you what he's had a fantastic game at left back for Slovenia he just comes through the back of Cope Palmer oh come on I don't think there's anything wrong with that I think he's given it for head contact but there was anything in it frustrating Connor yeah but you know what John they're doing it well they're doing it well we've all been there is and we were we're we're drawing we need a point we need a win we've got a good result and and we do things to try and win the game and they're doing it well and England have got to stand up to this they've got to get around this they've got to try and keep the ball on the deck and play properly if as expected they do get a place in the round of 16 then they will be difficult opponents whoever they're playing uh Alexander Arnold is on for trivia so a rare a rare sight of Kyle Walker at left back yeah I like this to be honest with you because Trent Alexander Arnold's right foot is up there with one of the best in the world and here's the pass from him long and downfield that cut out by the shaven head of Dracusic on the edge of the box still 0-0 and now only a matter of five and a half minutes left to play we'll bring in the interviews during six oh six with garrison's gate and the England players as uh Slovenia now make a double change so Jan Malakka is coming off from the left hand side of the midfield and Jan Gorinc Stankovic of Sturmbratz is coming off to replace him so Stankovic the number five is on and uh also coming off is Sporar so a double change for Slovenia with Jan Sejla coming on who is a forward player Sejla so that is a straight swap the number 19 who plays in Switzerland with uh Lugano so Jan Sejla under the field England nil Slovenia nil and uh England winning a throw in 10 yards inside their own half Kyle Walker they the latest left back with England have run through a few haven't they in recent times with uh with Luke Shaw's injury and uh and Anthony Gordon's also going to come on Alexander Arnold's ball in field missed Manu is behind him so Slovenia will mount an attack here the rare sight of Slovenia with the ball inside England territory here is Jan Sejla then forward towards uh the newly arrived Stankovic Declan Rice is able to step in Manu with a little ball back to Alexander Arnold Alexander Arnold down in the right back area uh to Palmer so Anthony Gordon's going to step into the tournament very shortly as Alexander Arnold plays it centrally to Fordham now back to Gay on the edge of the box if England win this match they will definitely go through as group winners searching for a late goal to make sure that that happens it is possible if Denmark were able to score a goal that would change the picture but it is still nil nil in the other match against Serbia here is Pickford passing it forward towards Declan Rice now Foden in the center circle Foden just moves away from Cherine Walker gets it onto his right foot high crossfield pass from him looking for cold Palmer Palmer with the first handcatch then runs into Janja and wins the free kick well yeah I don't think Janja will be very happy with that about Palmer running to him yeah it's interesting that because uh just watching a replay here the crossfield pass and the first touch from cold Palmer he's absolutely delightful with the outside of his boot over the top of Janja and he just gets in the way doesn't he Janja it's good defending but it's actually blocking cold Palmer's path to get on the second phase of the ball but it's a good position for England and they've got Trent Alexander Arnold over the ball as well now who's delivery that was one of the pretty good that was one of the touches of the tournament it was a fantastic touch in this one playing up at their own game a little bit a little bit of taste their own medicine John where we went out on fouling in the attacking band as he said this is a great chance there to Trent Alexander Arnold on the pitch yeah 88 minute still 0-0 free kick out on the right hand side Foden or Alexander Arnold brilliant delivers both the referee having some final words Jude Bellingham a bit of pushing and shoving Foden to take left footed headed down and cleared away should be cleared away on the edge of the box in fact it was passed away the main new main new I think you thought he conceded a free kick yes he has it has been given Slovenia as well you can hear the anger of the the England supporters they've been wound up by Slovenia but not sure there was a great deal in it Stojanovic but the referee saw it as a free kick and Anthony Gordon now coming on to replace Phil Forden how's he done tonight Phil Forden yeah I think he's been better more like the Phil Forden we know he's picked up some excellent positions beyond the midfield line he's moved outside he's moved wide he's gone in search of the ball but that man there that's come on he's jogging over to the left hand side Anthony Gordon I think there's been a lot of England fans screaming from to be out there and he's a player I very much admire let's see how we can get on in these last few minutes well I think they'll they've been I think they'll have been you know a bit of whole home when the when the team was announced tonight and there was just the one change the England fans wanted to see Gordon they wanted to see Plarmand menu on the field and now they are still nail-nail as the ball is flicked through from the the ball downfield from Oblakte Jordan Pickman we're in the 90th minute now so if it's going to come late for England it's going to come very late mind you this has been the euros of late goals nine goals scored a record equaling nine goals beyond the 90th minute here is Anthony Gordon for the first time running at Carnicholique that is touch as he tried to play it fast and took the ball out of play and it's a throw into Slovenia halfway inside their own half so Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton standing by to take your calls I think I know what the the flavour of that will be and it will be on it half fast after we've wrapped everything up here that's a great shift for Chris Sutton it is he never he never they never closed the Sutton's as Janja is going to be substituted for the final minutes of the match with Balkovich coming on now the other point to make by the way is that this is going to see Croatia out isn't it this is going to confirm that Croatia will be out of the tournament and it's virtually certain that Slovenia had to avoid a heavy defeat so these are the last knockings of Croatia's time that euro 2024 biggest casualties so far ball played downfield we are into added time four minutes of added time at the end of this game nil nil the stones steps forward with the ball not sure how much time there will be added on in the in the Denmark Serbia match whether that will finish before as probably afterwards you would have thought yeah five minutes have been added on there so there is the possibility if it stays like this that if Denmark score a late goal that would nudge England down to second in the table there might be some drama tonight as Alexander Arnall plays it across towards Kyle Walker still inside his own half but of the substitute certainly cool Palmer is will have lifted the spirits of the England fans that the Glenstead had of him here tonight yeah without a doubt he's hugging that right hand side at the moment that's a good ball from Gordon afflict the cane then across the Palmer left foot saved by our black who drops on it didn't quite catch it the way would have wanted to but arriving onto it on his left foot fantastic pass manzini Gordon I love the pass he drove inside played a pass zipped through the lines it's a brilliant one lovely touch around the corner and you just want it like the last night the only goal winning you just wanted to shape into that far corner and he just connected wrong with it I feel like here with the substitutes who've come on we're seeing a glimpse of of what England might and I know that we're always talking about if and might and what will they do but we've we are seeing it here tonight as football's a complicated game no a simple game made complicated by people that pass there for manzini Gordon just straight through Harry came with a little croft turn into the path of cope armor and spawn Connor with that shout by the way by Italy for Italy last night it's a similar chance but on the other side wasn't it yep it was the late goal that Italy scored so we we've got 90 seconds left to play still no no stays like this that's going to be a 1-0 win a 1-1 draw and a nil-nil draw for England in the group and I'm afraid you might not like it dear listener but the words tournament football will be will be mentioned again as Alexander Arnott plays it to Palmer down in the full back position Palmer wins it back me and who backed up Palmer Palmer to Alexander Arnott on the edge of the box it was a 50-50 ball and England fans want a free kick for the challenge Slovenia take it downfield and then gay actually runs into Kyle Walker who's okay did worry for him for a moment there England on the attack might be the last one Gordon Gordon with that blonde hair then Alexander Arnott right foot shot that high over the top by two or three yards and the goal kick for Slovenia with 40 seconds to go. Oh it's on Trent Alexander Arnott just picking the ball up in the middle of the box sorry just outside the box and he just lets fly and he's got a wonderful strike on him and we're urging that to nestle into the far corner it's just gone over the bar that was the moment. England nil Slovenia nil they wanted a statement performance really you have to be honest it's been far from that and the jury still will be very much out on how far England are capable of going in this tournament as the ball is flicked on downfield gay had to get there first but he did and there is the final whistle and Slovenia celebrate Slovenia celebrate now suddenly they're the story of the night they'll finish in third but they will be one of the third place qualifiers the greatest night in a tournament that Slovenia have ever had the first time that they've qualified for the knockout stages and they are celebrating appropriately nil nil three draws that's going to take them through and England unless we get a late goal from Denmark England are going through as group winners despite their toils in the group well those scenes to our right there are unbelievable for Slovenia like the amount of heart and grit that they put into that performance it was exceptional to watch at times the discipline and the coaching that's clearly gone on within their camp but on the flip side for England the players looked ejected they're clapping the fans because they know that they still haven't reached the performance levels that we all know they are capable of hopefully soon they will find them yeah well it couldn't be much worse for England after the Denmark performance for most of that match I suppose there are there are positives to be taken from this but England fans will want much much more in the knockout stages that England are through to England will play as group winners one of the third place finishers it looks very likely it'll be England Netherlands in the round of 16 on Sunday in Gelsenkirk and at five o'clock UK time that'll be confirmed but tonight England nil Slovenia nil on a very forgettable final night in a very forgettable group Mark Chapman let's just go straight to Masferiki watching Denmark against Serbia for how this is going to finish yeah and the second's ticking by here very nervous Denmark fans in fact the full time whistle has just gone mark and it has finished goalless in Munich as well Denmark nil Serbia nil Serbia really scaring Denmark late on really pushing for the win that they needed to try and keep their place in the tournament in the knockout stages going very very close Mitrovic booked as well late on for diving as well coming together with him in Anderson who wasn't happy as well with some of the tactics that Mitrovic was trying to employ to just rock Denmark's rhythm at the back in the latter stages but they have held on Denmark the three points we think is going to be enough for them to be in the knockout stages full time in Munich Denmark nil Serbia nil we are here then in Köln where it has finished goalless between England and Slovenia and John Murray first of all just back back to you with the sort of the difference in reaction between the two camps and the two sets of fans well I mean for Slovenia this is this is one of their greatest nights they've never had a night like this and for England many of the fans have left the ground there are still plenty there but Garo Southgate very pointedly is going out and walking on his own around in front of the England fans and applauding them I mean they're backing during the course of the match when you consider the kind of match that it was was was outstanding but the real celebrations the real winners here tonight are Slovenia and that they're having a real party to our right in the stands here in Köln everything ended goalless in group C to be honest I thought group B was still last night but group C both games ended goalless England and Slovenia and Denmark and Serbia and we are going to be left now and everybody is going to be left here Conor we're trying to analyse this and trying to look at this with what we've seen in front of our eyes for 90 minutes and the bigger picture of tournament football and that's a very difficult place to be to analyse where England are at yes of course it is what I will say is I think all the supporters in here all of us here as England fans we're a little bit worried with what we're seeing and listen we said before the game didn't we about we wanted a reaction we felt like this was the game we wanted this to be the game where England really arrived on this on this huge stage at this competition and and go we're here England are finally here and we just got to we haven't really seen that I don't think there was anything really in the game I don't think England really shone there was loads of chances there was a cold palm on at the end that we fancied and we wanted them to go and score for him because I thought he was great when he come on but you've got to give credit to Slovenia and we don't want to say that as England fans and funded commentating on on England games we want to work lyrical about England but looking at Slovenia here celebrate with a fan and we want that for our England team as well I'm just going through the best placed sides in third at the moment Slovakia still have a game to play now presuming in their last game that they don't get absolutely pumped they are likely to be in that's Slovakia not not not Slovenia Slovakia so you would be looking at Netherlands Slovakia and Slovenia all guaranteed in the last 16th so then it comes down to where the group F can get past Hungary Croatia are gone definitely it's whether Czech Republic or Georgia could get to four points and that would take Hungary out so you're left with two options really as far as England are concerned as long as I've got this right John Maurice D. Wood he normally does here absolving any responsibility in about to walk off and I've got to go and interview Karastassia. I know but as I understand it if it just comes down to whether a team in group F can take Hungary out it leads England with two possibilities if Hungary stay in and group F don't have a best third place team England will play the Netherlands that will be their last 16 time if somehow Czech Republic or Georgia get to four points and group F take Hungary out that will leave England with the best team best the third place team in group E so that's the Belgian group so it's down to two now either the Netherlands or the team that finishes third in group E unless Slovakia get walloped but I'll we'll come to that another time but yes you've described that brilliantly but just as well you had a match like that that you had time to work it out honestly I've done normally you don't like doing that sort of thing the two Sudoku's have done that now he's done it today on the train and what's happened to you with your crossword wasn't it with the colourful pillars inside this stadium reminds me of a Rubik's cube I wondered whether you had one of those with you as well now that I really would struggle with I've never looked perfect never would have been perfect it would have been it would have been what's your overall view well firstly might drop for you chappers that was an absolutely exceptional delivery of the permutations I'm very glad John Murray is still here because permutations are not my strong point but overall my view on England is you know I completely reiterate what Conor said I think there are a lot of England fans left a little bit confused after that a little bit uncertain but listen tournament football the good old cliche is England is still writing it and one of the massive positives is the substitutes and the second one is there's another game to go at least one other game are the substitutes the biggest positive for you Joe Hart who's joined us again in the Berlin studio I'm still rattled from the first substitute yeah look I think they I think they look sharp I think I think Kobe Mainu delivered a really good performance in the second half what I think what was interesting was when we knew who was coming on it was you know I had no idea who was coming off but it was exciting to see the guys come on even obviously Anthony Gordon he didn't get much time but Cole Park Cole Palmer looked really cool and you know what a lovely player he really he really makes things happen doesn't he without looking like he's making any effort it's exceptional to watch obviously Phil Foden really really tried to take the game by the scruff of the neck and if anyone was gonna if anyone was gonna take control it looked like him but yeah yeah that was um that was an interesting second half an interesting first half but you know as Izzy's just said I think we've just got to take the first place and and look to keep building we we know what happens in these situations now Izzy the sub comes on and and and dude does fairly well and Cole Palmer certainly brought the energy to that when he came on for Bacchaiosacken so we've been here in club four before and in international before the Clamor be now Palmer to start Mainu to start that they will be the tip bit difficult to tell Anthony Gordon because he had you know I mean it basically but we know how it works and yet sometimes you can have more impact as a sub if the other team have been tired for an hour so it's difficult one it's very difficult and I think obviously the cry will be cop Palmer has to start like you say but I think that the thinking is much deeper than that it's much deeper than he's had an impact for 20 minutes the thinking is what does the next opponent look like who have we got how do they play and that's Garis Southgate's job and his technical coaching staff is picking the right 11 with the best tools to unlock that team and to beat them in front of them and again I think that that's what makes the best managers great because you've got the Pep Guardiola's of the world who have a system and they dominate the system so well that it destroys anybody in front of them but then you've got some managers who are willing to adapt and I think England now they need to start adapting and looking at which players are going to unlock the opposition which players are going to cause damage and if that means dropping big names that doesn't matter because the team is the most important thing for England. Do you think the players they'll be interested to see who comes out and talks Joe will be in a sort of similar situation to what I said up at the start here that you're trying to balance another tough performance to watch in a lot of places with qualifying. Yeah look there's no doubt that they're gonna they're gonna try and hammer home the point that they've qualified and they've qualified as qualified at the top of the group other other you know big countries have struggled we looked at those games earlier this afternoon you know just seeing how France have ended up in second place and things like that but it's going to be a it's a tough interview trust me as a player who has been part of teams and part of England teams who are expected to do well and often in the first couple of games you have this noise and you what you personally I don't know how you feel kind of when you've been in these situations you do literally feel like a performance is around the corner you 100% believe that and feel that but for the you know for a third game to not be quite the level that everyone wants to be at it's a really really tough interview it's a really good what's a big test for them as a squad and as a team but look they've just got sick together they've got to believe in what they're doing they've got almost almost really really double down now and just have each other's backs you've got to have each other's backs in these situation you've got to you've got to you've got to be realistic of course you have and you've got to accept that you can do better but um yeah stay tight stay tight boys yeah I agree with hearty and the one thing that you look around when you go in and you are going through these periods is you look around at each other you go right what we've got in the dressing room and looking at that dressing room it's one of the best dressing rooms they'll probably sit in ever in the career because the players in there are unbelievable so so that's got to give them confidence but listen there's no beating around a bushing in a tough moment during a tough moment before they come to this competition because I think it was one one winning five and now it's one winning three in the competition so they are in a tough moment but like I said they've got to get in that dressing room look around at each other and go right where are we going what can we do and because like I said they're probably in the best dressing room they'll ever sit in in the careers so they've got to get the most out of that I think they need to adopt it and and nothing gets out and nothing gets in to our camp now I think they've got to have that because there's been a lot said which is okay and there's been a lot of response off the back of that and I think where they're at now is they need absolute 110 focus and I'm sure they are focused as I'm absolutely not questioning that at all but I think the players need to just completely strip everything down to their bare bones simplify the game simplify the thinking around it simplify the preparation and just focus on the basics of what they are good at and then bring that to the next match because the likelihood is the next match is going to be against an opposition who are higher ranked than Slovakia and they're going to have to put in a performance sorry Slovenian they had 12 shots Joe did England only four on target the only one I can remember in the second half was the one that Oblak saved from Palmer at the end I can't remember off there I think all the others came in the first half the other thing you know they played tonight 746 passes compared to 272 from Slovenia and yet were they too cautious for you at times but they were looking they were looking to really make it difficult for Slovenia I thought Slovenia you know codes as a center half I think they made some they really did make some key interceptions at the last at the last minute number six in the middle you know just got his head on a few things just as Harry Kane was about to finish obviously that great ball in from Kieran Trippier it was if spots and maybe moments no real we never really sliced them open obviously I think I think second half it's key sorry is it sorry Joe when they did they they got through on goal and it was a sequence of two or three passes and sometimes like building up great but if you can go and hurt the opposition hurt them yeah agreed and I think they were going down the route of trying to tire them and it was there was an interchange there was folding in the middle there was belling them out on the left I think obviously second half I don't think Slovenia got near our goal there was a few you know a few long balls up front that three or four of our lads were dealing with one so the pressure was there but yeah just just didn't quite find that opening and when they did a little toe or a head you know put a stop to it I agree what I was saying at halftime so I think we're lacking a little bit of confidence I do I've been in that position as a player I think we all have is haven't we Hart you were you are lacking that confidence you're lacking that little bit of an edge you're lacking that little bit of a mind just to play a wrist through the lines or it became a little bit too easy at times we were passing 10 yards passes back to Declan Rice we'll go out the other side I just didn't want to gain that confidence but we've got to believe in each other like I said sitting that dressing room and go right what are we going to do here we need to be strong enough to stand up as men and go right let's get back to taking wrists fireballs through lines if it means giving it to Col Palmer going 1v1 we mentioned in the first half as he didn't worry about the full back being on a yellow card it was only when Col Palmer come on did we actually then start running at the full back to have a go that becomes game management so I do think we're lacking in confidence and that's got to come back quick going into what our bigger games down the knockout stage okay by the way tonight Jordan Pitfors kept more clean sheets at a major tournament than any goalkeeper in England's history that's that's his stats are racking up Joe aren't they before we let you go yeah credit to him obviously that's a that's a great achievement but you know Jordan's definitely well I'm almost certain that his mindset isn't going to be about if he didn't keep a clean sheet in England won this tournament that that would be all that mattered to him obviously clean sheets mean that gives your team a chance but now with that with the caps and and the clean sheets that he's got to his name in big major tournaments he's just going to want to he's going to want a medal to put around his neck to have something to show for it. Joe thank you see you soon Joe's off to do you do tv highlights. It's tuning guys. That's why he stays in Berlin that's why he stays in Berlin. We'll be tuning in Jack. I'm guessing I'm guessing you might because it's the highlights because England have played do you have to start with England? Of course we do of course we do. We're going to pick into it and there's going to be positivity don't you worry about that. Absolutely but once they've done that Netherlands Austria is well worth watching. Thank you Joe. Talk to you later. Joe Hart with us on Five Life. Let's go down to the tunnel and John Murray. And first up tonight is the England captain Harry Kane. Congratulations Harry top of the group. That's what you come here to do isn't it but that was a tough night wasn't it? Absolutely I think yeah we can be proud of finishing top. It's not easy in these major tournaments as you've seen with other nations other big nations in the tournament already not finishing top so we can enjoy this for sure. It was a tough game. I thought it's probably our best performance out the three. I thought we was definitely had more energy without the ball. We pressed better. We counter pressed better which allowed us to have wave after wave. We just lacked a bit of magic in the final third but yeah that'll come. Another good clean sheet which we're going to need if we want to go far in this tournament that's for sure. So credit to the boys for that and yeah we enjoy it and move on to the next round. Yeah it was how should I describe it a little tentative in the early stages. Do you think that was a legacy of everything that's happened Denmark performance? I'm not too sure. You know all three performances have been different to start the game. Obviously Serbia we started well. Denmark we didn't start too bad too good. Today we didn't start great but I thought you know after 10 minutes we really drew into the game and the longer the first half went on the space it started to get bigger and we got into more dangerous areas and then that continued in the second half and the subs who come on made a good difference made bring a lot of energy and then like I said we just couldn't quite find that final pass but yeah hopefully that will come the knockout rounds. Yeah I mean are you going to tell me that you can grow into this tournament? Well I think if you look at previous tournaments for sure we started to play some of our best football in the knockout rounds the last year was against Germany against Ukraine and then Denmark and even the World Cup against Senegal in the knockout first knockout round so yeah for sure there's more to come I think always the objective to start the tournament is get through the group you don't want to have no mishaps and then you know your third place waiting to see what happens we finished top we've done our main objective yeah we can improve we know that but you've got to enjoy these moments major tournaments are really hard really difficult and to finish top is not easy. Yeah and just finally now you've won the group you know that you can't play another group winner until the semi-final looks as though might well be Netherlands in the last 16. Yeah I mean look whoever we get can be it's going to be a tough game as this group's showing and I think the whole every group that you've watched so far in this tournament there's some really good teams really well organized teams there's no easy game now in this type of competition so yeah whoever it is obviously we'll do what we always do prepare well debrief well and then yeah it's knockout football now it's the important start important part of the tournament where it all counts so yeah hopefully we can build a bit of momentum going into the knockout rounds. Harry Kane thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. He said they've got to enjoy it and they've got to celebrate it it did feel muted at the end though didn't it is he? Yeah and he's obviously got to come out the the England captain Harry Harry Kane to to be positive because you know they're all on a journey together and they want to win this tournament but obviously the the England fans and we can we can only assess you know from the outside what we see and obviously the game I think just leaves a little bit of disappointment because of exactly the talent that there is in that team but you know Harry Kane he comes out you know whether they win lose or draw and he speaks honestly he speaks from the heart and the lads were talking about him earlier weren't they about what a leader he is and how he communicates with the players and I think they just need a little bit of a reset they need to go again and obviously they need everybody in that squad the big players in particular to step right up and be counted. Gonna go back down to the tunnel we've got John Sones next I think John. Yeah it is John Sones winner of his 75th cap tonight John you've you started all of these tournament matches under Gareth Southgate so you're the ideal man to put into context this England finishing top of the group I know there'll be grumblers about the performance but come on give us a proper overview. I was super pleased to top the group so what we came here to achieve the first kind of stage of the tournament and I'm super proud of the players with what we've achieved two clean sheets which is so important in tournament football you know we can feel the tension from a small minority in the stands and that's to be expected you know we want to win games as well we're out there fighting for each other fighting for the shirt you know trying to live everyone's dream through us and we know we've got to improve and do better I thought tonight was a great step in in the right direction a lot of emotions and a lot of pressure on the game and I thought we handled that really well not the outcome that we want as I said before to we wanted the three points to top the group shouldn't be underestimated. It's not been quite like this before has it under Gareth Southgate under Gareth Southgate as a tournament the last few days that you've had? Yeah no it hasn't and it is what it is you know we're here to try and win and get everyone behind us and as I said do everyone proud think it's a little kid I keep taking it back to when I was a little kid sorry I got a little photo of me and my dad sent out here I was signing for Bansley funding it off in an England kit and it hit home you know I was that boy watching the England team now I'm the person in the other shoes and I want to do everyone proud at home as does everyone else and we want to we want to deliver for everyone we want to deliver for ourselves we want to keep improving and we want to achieve something that's never been done before. And it was Gareth Southgate who played you in all of these tournaments how much do you want to do it for him because he's been under the pump this week? Yeah 100% I think we're so together and I think he's a great character of how he controls everything his motions the outside pressure and we can't control that you know that's something that we shouldn't get involved David I don't think we have excuse me we could have been a totally different outcome tonight and how we played the game that outcome as I said before you know wasn't the three points but another clean sheet and clean sheets in tournament football is so important especially in the last year of roles I think that was something like one or three goals in 20 something games in I'm not sure it was about something like yeah and something I'm extremely proud of because that's a base that's a platform for the lads who you know go and show their flair and their skill and score goals and try and win as games and we know we've got improvement to do this week on the training pitch and we'll be self-critical of everything and you know look to to make that step forward again. Lovely thanks John and well done on the 75 John Stone's mark. Thank you John I think you found that interview quite difficult John Stones that don't touch on that. I've never known John money to take it. No no but I think again he was trying to he was trying to find the right path through that. Yeah yeah I think he was I think he's trying to find the positives out of it all like I think all England boys will do I think everybody will try and find the positives out of it I think that's the best thing to do but like I said I think as long as they know in that dressing room like like John Stones mentioned a few times there how important it is to improve before the next one because now it gets really tough now we look at it I think we've all been there is where you go through and you go right now the real business starts this is where it goes it's now or never we get it done because you can be sat there after the game comes Sunday and you can be going on the next day if it's not done right so now's where it gets really hard and you've got to make sure to do it properly and I think he was alluding to that but it's a hard one straight after the game honestly I've been here when you get get put a microphone in your face and it's right go on off your pot and it's tough when when you just had a performance like that. After the second game against Denmark some of the reaction from the players and staff was a tiny bit emotionally charged I think in a response and that interview there with John Stones was quite emotionally charged to me he spoke a lot about you know what it means to play for English which of course is the greatest honor as a footballer but I would say at this present just you know the angle I'm looking at it I think the emotion needs to be removed from it I think it needs to be a pragmatic approach simple effective basic instructions and just go back to what you're good at and I think that the whole trying to do the nation proud will come if you get the bits right on the pitch so I think they're close and they've obviously got to come out and be positive but I think just remove a little bit the emotion and focus on what's next. Earlier on when I was going through who England might play and how the best third place teams might fall into place which you both seem to enjoy at the back of my mind there was a huge doubt about who had actually finished second in this group and in the end and this this is why not that you know I'm making excuses and Mazfruicci could take this on it actually came down to a yellow card and a yellow card that Slovenia got for that pulling back of Harry Kane with about 10 15 minutes ago and I think that late yellow card has helped Denmark finish second but Maz maybe you're better briefed than me. I've been trying to do this for about 10 15 minutes which is why I said I think when it finished no-nil between Denmark and Serbia that that was enough for Denmark but yeah just to outline how tight it is you're absolutely right the most interesting thing really about this game tonight is just how tight it was between Denmark finishing second and Slovenia finishing second so with group C complete both Denmark and Slovenia finished with the same points tally the same goal difference the same goals scored and the same disciplinary record across the three games they played so players both picked up six cautions in total across the three matches so nothing to separate them there the next tiebreaker we look at is who has the best qualifying record these two sides were actually in the same qualifying group and they both finished on the same number of points too but Denmark finished above Slovenia on their head-to-head record so that's why Denmark finished second and Slovenia finished third are you still with me probably I haven't probably explained that very well. No you have you've explained it absolutely well on the no time in front of me that's absolutely spot on. So it does just explain doesn't it it just does you say how tight it was and there was certainly some tempers flaring late on in Munich Anderson in particular if he picked up a yellow then Denmark would have dropped a third and of course second in this group gets Germany so maybe finishing third wouldn't have been that bad maybe wouldn't have been that bad is there anything to say on the game or is it probably best that they how how a team is qualified is the most interesting conversation absolutely the most interesting thing about about this game completely forgettable much as it seems that as yours was as well I just think that Denmark just relieved really to get over the line and certainly work for them to do as well if they're going to challenge Germany in that game. Okay thank you very much man Denmark three and second they'll take on Germany England likely to get the Netherlands they could get the team who finished third in groupie and Slovenia go through as a best one of the best third place sides as well. Can I ask you a couple of tactical things you to about about this game there were several instances where I thought I saw players particularly out wide occupying the same three to five yards Bellingham and Foden in the first half a little bit main and Palmer when he came on in the second half maybe a little bit in the middle sometimes Foden and Bellingham. Yeah I agree with you Chappers yeah I think what we're seeing in this tournament in the first three games of the hour I think they both want to play in the same position I think they're trying to find the best out of each other so I think Jude or they're working on in training so I think Jude saying to Phil I'll pop outside if you come inside I'll occupy that space and it's just getting a little bit complicated I think as he said before it's just stripping it back and back to basics I actually looked at the time it was around 80 to 82 minutes and Phil had come inside to get on the ball and as Phil had come inside Trippie has then further on I think about 82 minutes I think oh my goodness earlier Trippie has gone a bit further on and you're thinking don't really want Trippie up there on the on the on his left foot in all that space you won't feel or you want a winger out there or so I just think it's complicated everything's complicating a little bit and I just get the feeling you both want to be in that same position at the minute and they're trying to get the best out of each other but it's hard when you both want to be in that central pitch get on the ball. Yeah from my angle what I see there's a lot in it and to describe on the radio without a tactics board is quite difficult however what I saw was I mean they've clearly been told we call overloads in football you get the numerical advantage in a certain area of the pitch to dominate the opposition and you want to work the ball because sometimes you know it's better to work the ball the ball does all the work not the players so that's what England have done they've gone out into wide areas they've added numbers out there and they've tried to dominate what they didn't do was penetrate in those areas so then what they've done is they've come back into central areas and then they've tried to circulate the ball and it's become a little bit frustrating to watch at times because it's been quite slow lethargic and you know not much piercing through the the heart of the defence and the other thing I noticed was the full back positioning cow walk and Keir and trippie on both sides at certain times they were almost in a centre back area and I actually would have liked to have seen them level off we call it what do we call it con when the full back deepens off squares off so you're parallel to your centre back partner because what that does is it creates a massive challenge for the wingers the opposition wingers and it actually ends up getting midfielders on the ball easier but what we did was we played into Slovakia's hands sorry Slovenia I don't know why I keep saying that it's because I've got it written in front of me right in a 4-4-2 and they just said we are happy here we are strong breakers down and they didn't and we didn't could the football could the full backs have overlapped more I don't think it was on to overlap because the wingers were told to get chalk on the boots at times but Foden's got licensed to start there but drifting Saka stayed out there and Connor you know nailed it half time get the ball out to Pocayo Saka and get him cutting inside so is it a tactical thing or is it a personnel thing? I don't think it I don't I think they'll be going through these things on the training pitch and I keep on I keep on saying it but when we're looking at the personnel we're looking at players who want to come inside we're looking at a lot of players we're looking at Bacchio Saka he's left footed so when you're left footed you don't often go down the right and cross the ball in because that's not your strong foot even though he can use his right foot so he's left footed so he tends to come inside the run he does really well for Arsenal is when Ben White who's not he's not he's not here gets on the ball he takes a run inside and Ben White plays into his path and he's running in his left foot they've not got them partnerships yet because Caliwog plays Man City or all that sort of thing so I just think it's people want to play in positions that they're not actually there at the minute so we've got Phil Foden coming in and things like that Saka plays off the right for Arsenal and he scored 16 goals last season 11 of those goals were with his left foot and Anthony Gordon scored the majority of his goals I think 10 out of his 11 goals this season with his right foot and he plays off the left for Newcastle so you've got players in there wide players with strengths of coming inside so we have got players that can contribute coming inside it's how you find the balance in the middle of the pitch and I think again nailed it I think Foden and Bellingham want to occupy the same spaces and this is where I'm talking about an act of and it's not a criticism by any means you have to take away some of your own game for the benefit of the team and if that means Bellingham makes continuous forward runs to create the space for Foden please do it if it means Foden has to actually just stay on the touch line do it it's just about what what works with the team to create that flow and the dynamic football that we want to see or the manager has to realise that he can't necessarily play the clamour for the players and Bellingham and Foden are the two where there will be huge clamour because of the season that they've had but you have to you have to pick something that balances your team and works for you don't you yeah you do absolutely and they're both like magnets to the ball they want to be on it all the time all the time they want the ball and and again you throw Karl Palmer into the mix and he is another player who wants the ball at his feet and how is that going to look if he ends up starting the next game now I know what you're thinking as you listen to this it's been two goalless draws it's not been that much of an entertaining night and as you go late into the night you need someone full of fun and Joanne de Viva who's going to put a smile on your face come in mystery voice um good evening I've enjoyed I've actually really enjoyed group C and the games tonight Mark now come on Christopher oh I'm lying I nearly nodded off had a hell of a day my train was three hours late eight and a half hours I've had on the train and had to come back and watch that well you've beaten me and Connor to his we as was to as took seven hours and was two and a half hours late so you've won that first time I've beaten you anything you won your own yes yes and and that's the worry because I don't speak German so I didn't actually I didn't dare get off the train and try and get another one because I didn't know what was going on it's quite tricky really what did you do on your own for I mean you know maybe this old platform part of 6 0 6 but what did you do for eight hours on your own on the train well I just talked to myself and sort of chuckled myself that's that's basically what I do Mark that's right come on Chris what did you do well I've read a book tell the nation what I do read I've read a book yeah I've read a book did some prep and then I was I was excited about the game this evening can I bring a bit of positivity to proceed that'll be a face Chris morning don't you start dear me so I mean so England haven't performed well but their objective at the start of the other group was to finish top they've done that look at Portugal I'm going to give George Cummings the producer credit for this he reminded me Portugal 2016 third in their group against Hungary Iceland Austria been Switzerland on penalties beat Poland on penalties beat Wales in the semi-final and then beat France in the finals so England haven't got going but a sort of law of averages isn't it these these players are too good not to get going the one thing I did I did think we all learned from tonight Cole Palmer has to start instead of instead of Bacchia Sacca was is he suggesting sort of what is listening in about maybe dropping Jude Bellingham is he really gosh Chris don't be ridiculous I think Bacchio Sacca needs to stay on the pitch as well by the way so you wouldn't you wouldn't play Palmer I mean he did more who would you drop then you can't have 12 I think you need to consider Foden's position I think he's been excellent I think he's wanted to get on the ball he's not been the Manchester City Phil Foden that we all know all about but I think you're going to have to drop a big name in order to get a maximum team output and there you go does does your positivity stretch to believing believing that England are on the right side of the draw yes the French yes second and isn't that disrespectful to the other sides who are on England side of the draw who have played some good football like Austria look a little bit disrespectful maybe but you know I'd keep my disrespect personal to myself if I was an England player I would be really excited about what has happened so far and the fact that they know they can play a lot better they you know these are these are players week in and week out who who play brilliantly in the Premier League Harry Kane scored a bundle of goals in the in the Bundesliga and they haven't clicked but then they look at the other side of the draw what Spain and Germany and France the outstanding teams in the tournaments well not France but but Spain and Germany and you know the fact of the matter is is there's a good chance if if Gareth gets things together that England can get to the final I honestly Mark I honestly believe that and I don't want to burst your positivity bubble but I'm going to ask all three of you some of these will have been friendlies is there a concern that England have only won two out of their last eight games in total no okay Connor Chris I love your positivity by the way I'm all for that I think you're gonna say yes that means yes yeah I think it is I think there is a little bit yet but I am I am all for it becomes serious now and I do think that they know they've got to improve is he same as Connor they've got to improve they've got to you're on shortly are you Chris what are you laughing at Chris who would have thought that I could be more positive than anybody that's a good I am how long's your show tonight 15 minutes hopefully there's some sort of jeery call us one hour one hour and no doubt we'll get the garroth haters on but but but but but honestly we did learn tonight I need to jump in because garroth Southgate is live with John Murray yes here he is England manager garroth through the group again as you have done at all of your tournaments when people look back at this in years to come they'll probably see England top of the group what how should we regard this opening to this campaign and what did you think of the performance tonight well I thought tonight was progress I thought we used the ball better we totally dominated the game particularly the second half we had them pinned in for long long periods I was pleased that we had enough composure not to get anxious because you know we we know what the last week or so has been like and in those moments where everybody's desperate for the win you can end up not using the ball as patiently and find yourselves in trouble so really pleased with the composure that was shown really pleased with the impact of all the players that came into the game um yes of course we did like a couple of goals to send everybody home happy but um in the end that wasn't to be tonight but I don't think it was for the one of the effort of the players or um you know the ability to open the opposition up it was probably just the finishing touch or the final pass a couple of times that led us down a bit how much has called Palmer impressed you with what he did there having having not played he's obviously had a spell without without actually playing in a in a competitive match and yet looked very sharp didn't he he did yeah well that's what we've seen in the last few days in particular in training and uh we've got good players in the squad and we you know don't feel we should hesitate to use them so he showed a real composure um yeah he's he's got a really um calm manner about him and I think that showed in the way that well both he and Coby the way they came into the game was two very young players has he staked a claim there to to start well he has been staking a claim without a doubt um you know we've got to we've got to look at who we play next what's the best way of going for for the next game um but it was fabulous to see that we need a strong bench as well these games are 95 plus minute games it's not just about uh the players who start you know you need players to come in and have the impact like you did you you made a point there of going around the the england fans and thanking them for for their support tonight you know how much do you need them with you bearing in mind the difficulties that you've had yeah look I think uh I mean they were brilliant in the second half especially you know there there was constant noise behind the team uh I I kind of get it they they are not happy with me it's the reality of that I'm not going to back away from that um they need to does that does that hurt look I'm not going to um it I need them behind the team and need them behind the team so it's fine I have to deal with what I'm dealing with I wasn't going to back away from going and thanking people for coming and giving us the support they did but I know that that's creating a bit of a an issue for the group um I can deal with that but I need to support the players and um the more the fans are as they were in the second half behind the team it's a massive lift for them because we're operating in a in a very very unusual environment just just finally do you sense that it will get better from here in the knockout stage yeah look I think we I don't think we were going to go from the performances we just had to a game of such pressure and score four goals it's football doesn't work like that so I'm pleased with the progress made uh we of course it's important to to win the group because you control your own destiny whether you end up with a better draw or not is is going to be debatable but I think you never want to look back on a tournament and say are we drop points and therefore we ended up going a different level of opponent and that was the reason that we uh we didn't succeed so um to to win the group is always important I think. Gareth thanks very much and well done for topping the group there we go now if he goes Gareth Southgate Mark right you might have been able to hear just as we were doing that interview Radio Slovenia we're interviewing Matjash Kek right over my right shoulder oh do you want to try and get Matjash Kek before we go? He's gone he's just gone I can't believe you missed your opportunity and I honestly do not think that there would have been a better chance to get him. John thank you very much Izzy Christiansen, Connor Cody still with us as we get ready to say goodbye from here in Cologne, Golan Street in England and Slovenia that was a very telling line there towards the end where he said we're operating in very unusual circumstances. I don't know how to interpret that if you please. No, no, but I think you know referring to a camp a football team whether that be club or country you know there's pressure and I think that nothing needs to leave that camp no information and I don't think anything should enter that camp any information I think what needs to happen is you know Gareth and his staff have got the opportunity now to bounce forwards in the right direction and they need to keep focused on that and not let any external noise affect them",
