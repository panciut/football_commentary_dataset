  "transcript": " And Spain get us underway in the all red kit with the yellow trim, yellow numbers on the back. And Germany are all in white tonight, or at least the shirts do have a big black stripe down the front. Vertical stripe. And immediately the ball is put out of play for a throw into Spain, halfway inside the German half. This one of the biggest stadiums, three tiers all the way around. I'm guessing it's something like two thirds full, perhaps the actual correct capacity is up towards 70,000. Spain had the ball forward, but it's not up towards the halfway line, and it will be headed further back by Dani Carvajal. He's the one player who's come into the team tonight. The indication of Luis Enrique was that there would be changes tonight, but just the one Carvajal coming in to Chelsea's captain sees that Asperle Quetta. And we'll see how Spain respond after their handsome victory, their record World Cup victory in their first match against the Costa Ricans. The ball has played back into central defence, and Spain played out towards the left-hand side. Dani Almar is there and plays it back to Yordi Alba, and then it's lost in center field, Busquets dives in, doesn't make the ball and commits the foul. The referee, by the way, is also European, Dani Makali, one of the top Champions League officials from the Netherlands, and he says no foul. Right away we can see that Germany, they've made a tactical change from the first game, they're now playing for the back, where they played three of the back. Sula was kind of playing to the right-hand side, which wasn't a good thing for German in the last game, but they're playing for the back, three in front and three, sorry, three midfield and three up front, matching Spain's 4-3-3 as well. Spain nipped the ball back on the edge of the area, but it bounced up and it struck the arm of the sensión, his arm was out wide from his left-hand side, so free kick. Germany, Ruedigat takes it away downfield, a long free kick to the edge of the Spanish penalty area that Yordi Alba is able to get to, Gnabry putting them under pressure there, and he's put it out of play for a throw in next to the corner flag, so the Germans with a throw on the right-hand side. From much of their opening match against Japan, it looked plain sailing, but it was only a 1-0 victory and Japan turned it right around in the closing stages. So a throw into Germany on the right-hand side, which is taken into the penalty area, glances off Spanish head, snotted back across the box by Rodry, and then Spain are able to take it up towards the halfway line with Danny Olmol, who claims he was took back, and referee Macaely says yes, you were. But it is a free kick to Spain inside their own heart, so Spain, 0, Germany, 0, this is a match that is live on BBC TV tonight, and whenever a World Cup match is live on BBC TV, you can choose, if you like, to listen to the five live radio commentary alongside the TV pictures via World Cup Extra on iPlayer, that's where you find it. Go to iPlayer, World Cup Extra, follow the simple instructions, and Spain are winning another free kick for a foul on Gavi in central midfield, and this is over towards the right-hand side, so Spain will have the free kick there. So what we just saw there was one of the problems that Germany have in this line-up is that they actually, Kimmich, won the ball in midfield, they were trying to release Thomas Müller, but as we can see, we saw here he wasn't fast enough, so there's no real pace right at the top of the German team. Yeah, that could be a real issue, couldn't it for them tonight? But you know, I've just failed as well with the changes that have been made, there's an element of Hansi Flick wanting to be as solid as possible against this Spanish side as well. Well, Rudiger and Zulat with the ball on the edge of their own penalty area, back it goes to Neuer, I'm sure we'll talk about him, Pete Edger in the course of the evening, the great Manuel Neuer just angling the ball out towards the left-hand side to round, and round chips at four, but he's actually chipped it straight into Spain's path, and now it's played along the edge of the penalty area. A lovely change of feet on the edge of the box, Ferran Torres on the right-hand side, played into Ascensio on the edge of the box, a heavy touch from Ascensio, it got away from him, and Germany were able to clear. Spain won the ball from a mistake by David Raum, who I thought didn't play well in the first game, but he's in the team again, gave the ball away nearly in his own penalty box. Ferran Torres passed it to Ascensio, but he missed kick or misplaced the touch. It was actually quite a good opportunity right here at the beginning of the game. Spain 0, Germany 0 on a very pleasant night, temperature-wise, or at least it is up here. There is what feels like a breeze blowing, but you never quite know whether it's an actual breeze or whether it's just the air conditioning. The ball's played out for Spain up the left-hand side, and it finds its way centrally to Pedri, and then forward up towards the halfway line where it's laid off by Ascensio, and then back again to Pedri. Very interesting to see tonight, Spain against Germany, who it is who dominates the possession in this match. And Spain playing it back into the back line. Full-time score at Portman Road is Ipswich 4, Buxton 0 in the end, so a National League North Buxton go out of the FA Cup, and Ipswich of League 1 are into tomorrow night's third round draw. And we will have news of that on 5 live. You can follow it on BBC 2 tomorrow night. It takes President Anfield tomorrow evening, the home of the FA Cup holder. So the third round draw tomorrow night. Spain continue to have the ball deep inside their own half, and Rodri turns and passes it out to the right-hand side, and then back it comes into the Spanish half to Carvajal. There's a bit of an issue for Luis Enrique what to do when you've got Sergio Busquets, and you also have Rodri, and the way he's got round that is by playing Rodri in central defence alongside his Manchester City teammate Imaret Laporte. Now the still the Spanish half possession. This is a long, long period of Spanish possession. Pedri plays it through the middle, now towards the edge of the box. Gavi's there with a touch. Esencio plays it to the left-hand side. Dani Olmo with a shot, but rattles against the crossbar. My goodness he hit that. That was an absolute screamer from Dani Olmo from an angle on the edge of the box, and it rattled Neuer's crossbar and stayed out. What a fantastic opportunity to go one-nil down. Actually I think Manuel Neuer gets a hand to it. It's a fantastic save. It goes through the legs of Vudiga, and I have to say the German defence is all over the place. Actually it's Kierer, it goes through the legs of Kierer, and Manuel Neuer makes an unbelievable save here early on. What a terrific touch from the goalkeeper. Germany this time sliding in, down in the full-back position. Kierer put the challenge in. He had to make the ball there, but he did, and he put it out for a throw on the left-hand side. That's a worrying start for Germany. The way that Spain, you know, with that possession, Peter, they must have had it for what, 40-50 passes, something like that, and it ends up with an end product. And that's what you expect when you play against a team like Spain. And that's why Hanser-Flick has changed his system. So he plays forward the back. It hasn't worked out yet, but they don't look settled at the back. They actually on this, the chance before they were all over the place. Sule works a slit. But they need to settle down a little bit in defence. They actually play a forward the back with two in front. The gimmick in the Goretzka sits right in front of the defence, and they need to settle down a little bit. Yeah, with Manchester City's Gundawang furthest forward, playing almost actually, when Germany go forward, playing almost a number 10 role for Manchester City man. There are City players on both sides, Real Madrid players on both sides, and RB Leipzig players on both sides. Spain bring the ball away from the back. Four Barcelona men in this Spanish team. The team at the top of the league are going into the World Cup. Here is one of the Real Madrid man, Mord. Carvajal, and the Sensio, the two Real Madrid players in the squad, are in the team. It comes back into central defence, and La Porte just helps it out to the left-hand side. Jordi Alba, the experienced, left back 33 years old now. Back it comes into centrefield. A long left-footed pass from La Porte. Hit that beautifully. That's well taken down as well by Ferran Torres, up to the edge of the area, but a very good challenge by round this time. But came it, got the ball, doesn't bounce out of play. Yes, it does. The assistant has flagged, and it's a throw into the German. And that's clever play. Spain are stretching, they're using every inch of this pitch. So Ferran Torres is right on the touch line, and on the other side, Marco Sensio is on the left-hand side, and then Daniel Homo is in the middle. Or they alternate around, but they are stretching the German team, they're putting a lot of pressure on, and that diagonal ball is on all the time, and I think we'll see that a lot tonight. The early signs are a little worrying, I think, for Germany and for Hansi Flick, and the Spanish team would have brought that confidence from the opening win against Costa Rica with them here to Alcor, which is the area, the Tard of Qatar, in which this stadium has been built. The Albet stadium designed to look like a better one than the 10. The Germans go into the end, that was a nice touch from him, and Mullah is now taking it on towards the edge of the box, and it's leading to Canabri, but out comes Sino, and makes it a good save. And actually the offside flag is up, after the ball was carried forward centrally, actually by Kurekska, just to correct myself, but it is an offside flag. And that was a fantastic opportunity for Germany to counter Spain, so Muziala fell in deep, made a nice little touch to Kimmich, I think it was, who passed it up to Mullah, who then ran towards the goal. And I think he picked the wrong option, he should have gone back to Muziala, he opted to play to Kurekska, who unfortunately for Germany were in an offside position, but Unai Sima ended up saving him, good for him, good start. Yep, so Germany, that's the counter, Spain had the shot that hit the crossbar, saved against the crossbar, Germany have now had a chance at their own with Canabri, but it's Spain who come forward, still 0-0, very early stages here. Here's the ball to the right-hand side for Ferran Torres, down in the German left-back position, round comes across, but just stands off Ferran Torres, and he uses Dani Carvajal behind him, Champions League winner of course, several times over, through the middle it is now, Pedri out to that corner. Pedri out to that left flank for Spain, Dani Olmo is there, and then in it comes infield towards Ascensio, he's dropping deep again, that's a feature of his play, and Spain go all the way back into the centre circle, and just knock it around. The little triangles from Spain, we've seen this run one for year after year after year, it's very much the Spanish style that led them to those great successes in the World Cup and the Euros, three tournaments running, Ball out towards the left-hand side, which is taken down by Olmo, and then back into central defence to La Porte again, and La Porte just shifted on, was left foot, and here's that pass that Peter was talking about, out to the right-hand side, which is headed infield by Ferran Torres, but Germany have got it back, that's into the centre circle for them. Goon De Wan was surrounded by red shirts, it's been nicked off him, Busquets gives it forward to Ascensio, Ascensio now, out to the left-hand side to Olmo, Olmo running at Carra, and there's a collision between them on the edge of the box, the ball ran away, Olmo looks at referee Mackerley, who was saying, no, play on, there's having none of that at all, and Germany have been able to get away. And it's nice to have a referee who does some blows with it every time somebody goes down, and you can see the reaction of the players, they're just getting on with it. Germany, again, coming forward, and Spain will deal with that report, just shepherds the ball to the edge of the box and gives it to the goalkeeper. Simon, the athletic Bilbao goalkeeper, so David De Her, Peter of your old club, Manchester United, very much not in the international picture, Luis Enrique has been very firm about that, and Unai Simon is his man. He has been playing every game in the last two years, and one of the reasons for that is what we're seeing now, that he actually is a very good football player, so he can be that extra man in the build-up. The ball comes back at the Spanish defence, now back into midfield, where Goretzka is able to take it up, Rudiga plays it to the left-hand side, now round, coming forward, we're going to see him in that sense for the first time in the match. Muziala turns onto his right foot, but just a little touch in there, took it away from him from Gavi, and now Spain bring it forward with Pedri, they're the legs on, they are either side of Busquets. Pedri on one side, and Gavi on the other, the two youngsters, but Spain go all the way back to goalkeeper Simon, all in black down there to LL. We talk a lot about Pedri and Gavi, they are exciting players, they're young, we can't wait for what the future holds for those two, but there's also Muziala on the other side, the Bayern Munich player, 19 years of age. He starts again, I thought he was really really good against Japan, he had that little move where he kind of danced through the Japan defence, and it was only the finish that wasn't up to scratch, but that is what Germany hopes that he can do more of today. He's had a couple of opportunities already, and I'm very excited to see him on the pitch. Likewise, we've had a chance to watch him recently, so I've seen a little bit of him live when England were in the same group in the Nations League as Germany and Muziala, who could have played for England, but like Moussa who were watching the other night, who I was very impressed with, but now playing for the United States, so more on Muziala in a moment, but it is Spain with Ferran Torres, who plays it now forward, for Gavi who's chasing after it, but he won't reach that, and he's just slightly over hit by Ferran Torres, so it is behind for a German goal kick. But the other thing, I've got a chance to have a little chat with him actually as well Muziala, and what a nice lad he seemed to be, really really sort of humble touch, and he's got the world at his feet. He comes across very sympathetic in interviews, he talks well, but I've seen this with younger players that comes out of Bayern Munich, that there is some kind of, I don't know if it's an education or what, but they are well taught. Another player for instance, Pia Mille Hoibia, who also went through Bayern Munich's academy, they have this lack, I don't know what it is, but it's nice to see young players with that, and then of course he backs it up with really good performances. Very good player as well. Formerly of the Southampton and Chelsea Academy. So that is Jamal Muziala, but the ball is up to the great Thomas Muller, I think we can call him that, but not so great because he came back from an offside position, so it's a free kick to Spain inside their own half. Spain, no Germany, no already 15 minutes played, just a reminder, if you haven't heard, this is the group involving Costa Rica and Japan, Costa Rica won earlier today, so coming into this match, Spain with three points, Japan with three points, Costa Rica with three points, and Germany with none so far. It could be three points all round going into the final round of matches. Muziala takes the ball in centre midfield and has a little dart forward with it, that was good. Positive stuff from him, taking on the Spaniards. Back it comes to Rudiger, and Rudiger playing in Spain of course, for Real Madrid, turns it to his left, a round. Rudiger makes himself available and then turns and gives it back to Neuer in the deep on the edge of his own penalty area. They're not kept too many clean sheets in recent times, the Germans, the match pre-tunament was their first in eight matches, round stretching for this but you can't reach it and it's out of play for the three into Spain. And it's something they need to improve on, they need to improve on their defence. I thought the two goals they gave away against Japan, they both of them could have been avoided. Most of all with a little bit of concentration, especially the second goal, the number of mistakes that you could count on that. Ball played across his own penalty area, that was very risky but it's fortunately for Spain headed back by La Porte to his goalkeeper, Carvajal, trying to, sort of with the outside of his boots, spray it across the edge of his own penalty area and very nearly presented it to Germany but they've got away with that. It's a bit silly that wasn't it, but how cool was La Porte, it just pounced up in the air and he headed the back to his goalkeeper under pressure and the goalkeeper was under pressure, just caught it and then Spain is on the move again. Yeah but when you've got two Manchester City players in central defence, if there were the players of one team that you would back to be able to cope with that, it is Pep Guardiola's players throwing to Spain over on the far side. The ball is taken down by Pedré, Busquets, that was a little short as well but he's too well there. We had Germans either side of him but he was able to stick out one of those extremely long legs and Spain have got it back and bring it forward on the right hand side and then in comes the challenge from round and Ferran Torres, One soft Manchester City and it's out of play for the throwing just in front of Hansy Flick down there who was the former Bayern Munich coach who actually gave Muziála his debut and now he's his national team coach. Round with the throw down the line, he's thrown it straight off the pitch, you don't often see that. At this level that doesn't happen very often but he did. He's just hitched up his shoulder there as if to say, just had a bit of a twinge there, that's what happened there. Just going back to Rudiger, I think this is a very big game for him because as we've already covered that, the defence against Japan wasn't great. Sulu who has a ball now, he didn't have a great game so far, he's not been that good. He had a big chance before he slipped. Rudiger needs to be the leader there, he needs to control and help the other defenders, of course with the experience of Neuer behind. And Rudiger, he has got that, we've seen that in Chelsea at Real Madrid. That's Peter Schmeichel with us on 5 live tonight and BBC Sounds, take the world cup with you with BBC Sounds throughout the tournament. There's Germany now in a very congested area on the half way line and then round and carbahal into the challenge together but it's the Spaniard who got the touch all the way back to Sulu. Muziála again who's challenging the Spanish players and it looks good, he thought he'd be fouled. He's a little bit frustrated with the referee that he didn't get a free kick but the referee tonight is letting play go and I like that. I like it. Also Spain with the ball on the left hand side, it almost always makes for a decent game and I think you've got to be a confident referee to do that. And the ball is with Laporte, half way inside his own half, Laporte just turning it back to Sino behind it. So still no goals and the closest we've come was the shot from Danny Olmau but was very well touched with one glove under the crossbar by Manuel Neuer, Germany with a run on the half way line. And it is Kimmich, Joshua Kimmich, one of six Bayern Munich players in this German starting roundup today. And now to the right hand side, to Kehrat of West Ham, he turns and gives it back to Neuer. And there's been a lot of talk about Kimmich maybe going back to right back today in order to get the defence sorted out but he said himself yesterday there's no way he's going back to right back. He's a midfield player and that's my position. Yeah, that's where he wants to be, Kimmich and Spain, Busquets turns the ball into the space, it's been taken forward by Pedri to the edge of the area, lovely feet from him, bounces back to him. And now a turn from Gaby on the edge of the penalty area but Zula was there behind it and as it ran for him he just whacked it away to the half way line. You see the influence there, the three, the midfielders, Busquets, Pedri and Gaby combining in there together. Yeah and very well defended by the German back four. And Busquets now to Jody Alba who cuts in field on his right foot, shoots and it whizzes low and wide of the foot of Neuer's right post but it was wide probably by two or three feet. Jody Alba on his right foot, we don't see that very often and it was like Neuer was scrambling a little bit but I can see now on the replay that he knows it's going, he's driving for it but then he's taking his hands away, he knows it's going on the right side of the post. And Al Neuer 36 years old now, what a career he's had, one of the world cup winners of course from 2014, Germany the winners 2014, Spain the winners in 2010, Germany coming forward now but that's given away rather carelessly on the right hand side and Spain bring it forward. Actually he's been taken out towards the right hand side here by Pedri who does well, they've enjoyed that, the neutral supporters, the talent that he showed there and then a foul by Ferran Torres and a free kick to him. He's as good as Pedri, I mean that was fantastic, he was given the ball in his own half in the centre circle and he went right and more right and more right and at the end of that move, unfortunately for him he lost the ball, he not made David Brown but that technique is brilliant to see isn't it? That pass to Simon who takes a heavy touch and was able to follow up and clear that away, I don't think it's a skip there, it was on its way to it. That's one thing about the actual football that's been played with in the world cup, it's a bit lively, it's sort of like we've actually seen from a few incidents where a side foot doesn't take the spin and therefore even if it's two yards away players don't get it and I think it's designed for players to have shots from distance. I'm sure there's a goalkeeper Peter, that's not absolutely ideal. No it's not and another thing there is very little grip on the ball. Jimny win it back and Abri on the right hand side comes in field but that's given us a free kick and that's what Pedri is saying over there that he was about, Jordi Albo is saying that he was fouled by Benabri and the referee brings him his brought it back. The first time he's given a free kick does something like, it's not a free kick, it's actually a free kick the other way to be fair, it's a free kick for Germany but you ask for it, if you don't ask you don't get it, you ask for it, you've got it. Spain nail Germany nail and Germany win it back around just threw himself at the ball and was quite fortunate actually to cut it out before it reached Father Hall. Father Hall now Mola into the penalty area but away from Kunda Wang or given away by Simon. Canabri now brilliant turn left foot shot across the face of goal but beyond the far post. He played for Canabri, two appearance from the keeper though. OK we've been praising Simon saying that he's playing because he's very good at his feet. In the last three minutes he's had three situations where he's shown the exact opposite. We've just talked about the one that Barbra took the heavy touch then he gave the ball away unnecessary before he's trying to play it out from inside the six yard box out to the right full back that was intercepted and now he gave the ball away inside the 18 yard box and actually shown a little bit of insecurity in the Spanish defence. We haven't seen them under pressure in this World Cup yet but by the looks of that if you put a little bit of pressure on them well there are vulnerabilities there. David Round the left back who remember jumped for that ball and cut it out seems to have a problem. I think he might have just actually put the ball in his mid-drift if you get in the drift. Or he maybe just took a hit actually from Father Hall as well but anyway he's OK and I think he's going to be able to continue. Our little television here showed us two of the great former Spanish players, call us Puyol and David Vier sitting together in the comfortable seats. Peter I don't know whether you ever find your way into those comfortable seats at this World Cup. I have a feeling you might do as Germany have the ball inside their own half. What are you doing that tomorrow in fact? I was there last night. Oh yes and are they comfortable? Oh it's given away by Neuer, that is careless and now all-mall across the edge of the box. Ferran Torres with the shot but it was blocked at source, defender came across and Neuer gets out of jail. I'm not sure what's going on here. I mean Neuer attempts a very difficult pass over two Spanish players with this left foot. But Raum who was just out before which looks to be a little bit of a groin strain came back and blocked the shot. I don't know what's going on here with the goalkeepers. Why are they attempting the most difficult things? The thing is for what happened to Germany in the Japan game, the goals they conceded, what they need now is to settle down and defend. Don't give anything stupid away. And Neuer who is the most experienced in that team should know that best of everyone in that situation. That was just silly. He got away with it though. Peter Schmeichel, this is Spain, Germany, Nell and Zula has the ball on the edge of his own penalty area. And now Rudiger has the ball, has played across the penalty area, has to turn, Ferran Torres putting him under pressure. Rudiger pulls it away, drags it over the top of the ball, turns, Raum up to the halfway line. But Muller's not reaching that. Spain have taken possession and Seaman was halfway between the penalty area and the centre circle to come and intercept it. And then Raum puts in a challenge that leaves Carvajal on the floor. I think that's a little bit of retribution from Raum on Carvajal after the earlier incident. Yeah, it could be. But what is really impressive to experience when you are at the stage, it's very difficult to see that on the TV screen, is how good these players are receiving the ball under pressure. There's not a single player on the pitch now that will not receive the ball and do something good about it. Rudiger did it before under pressure. No, he couldn't pass it back to Neuer, so he passed it out to Raum who was under pressure by two players and he still got the ball and got it up the pitch. It's very, very impressive to watch. Ball back with Neuer on the edge of the six yard box and Asensio was close to him. But he was able Neuer there to turn and clear it away. Muller's lost out on a challenge on the halfway line but gets to his feet, wins the ball back, now it's been forwarded by Kera. Gnabri is there as well. Kera continues his run but it's been overrun by Gnabri. He's a little fortunate and it's bounced back to him but then bounces away from him and then through the middle, Rudiger just steps in and says, right, that's enough of that, carry on and just clappers it away downfield. Scrappy little period of play after what was there. Scrappy, yeah, and you know, Gnabri continues the way he played against Japan. He missed three big chances. I didn't think he had a good game and I kind of expected him not to play today and so far he's not played very well. What he does, which is beneficial for the team, is of course he takes part in that first bit of pressure and he's very good at that. But with the ball today, he's just given away. Another free kick. That was a cheap one. Center field for the Germans. They'll take it, certainly. And a free kick is tapped short in the center circle by Kinnick to his right. Zula is going to have a little wonder forward with the ball at his feet and now he plays it to the right-hand side. Tilo Kera is there. Kera in field again. Zula's still up there. Here's the cross looking for Muziala inside the penalty area. Beggis pardoned. Muziala, he is now on the left-hand side. Muziala picks up the ball. Muziala then taps it back now to Rudiger on his right foot. I've seen him hit them from here before. But I've seen him hit them better than that. He got right underneath it and sailed it away high over the crossbar and it landed halfway up the lower tier of the stand. I've seen him hit them before as well. Better. But I've also seen him do that. 35 yards out. Yeah, why not? You'd have a shot. Give the goalkeeper something to think about. Give the defender something to think about. Because he might find himself in a similar situation later on in the game and then there might be other options. I thought that was a foul on a sensio. But the referee hasn't given it. Place continued. And then the ball actually ricochets to the edge of the deep. But Simon was out ever so quickly. The goalkeeper, the Spanish goalkeeper, to put in the challenge is sort of sliding clearance ahead of Mula. Fantastic awareness by the goalkeeper. That could have been a free chance for Mula. But the goalkeeper, he read the situation very well. Got out 5 yards out of his box and cleared the ball. And normally a goalkeeper like Simon, 25 years old, who's playing for the Spanish national team, and is clearly highly thought of by Luis Enrique. You'd think, well, he'll be having one of the top European clubs. You know, and away from his home club, Athletic Bilbao, but seemingly he wants to stay there for the rest of his career. Well, yeah, as Germany have got a problem, because it is Guretska, who is just laboring. He's actually gone down on his horses, leaning forward, play continues. Spain with a throw in the left back position. And then it's played out to the right by Mula. Gnabry and Kera are there. They can't keep it in Spain and it's another throw, 3 or 4 yards away from the corner flag. Just going back to Guretska, I'm not sure what happened there, but he seems okay. No, no, he's leaning forward again and he does not look in the best shape. He's definitely ailing in some way, throwing to Germany. It's played back by Kimmich, although they're to the far side. It's been a really good way, but Zula has got that to the Germans as they play Germany in this first half from right to left. And Rudi Gat gives the ball back to Zula, and then through the middle to Puer Pass centre field. That gives it back to Spain, but it bounces for Guretska, who went into the challenge, was upended, ended up on the turf again. Then it comes back to Busquets near the edge of his penalty area. And now Rodri just takes a couple of touches to give it to the right-hand side. De Carvajal, who will begin to move forward towards the half-way line, but then checks in field and Spain have got it inside their own half. This referee doesn't want to get free kicks. It's amazing how much he's letting go. And he's got to be a little bit careful because there's a little bit of need between one or two of the players, and this could get out of hand if he doesn't calm it down a little bit. Yep, there's a lot of very, very familiar faces there. And as I say, clubmates as well, those sort of rivals. The ball is played forward down the left-hand side, Danny Ormoy is into this, and Ormoy across, and Ferentore's blasts it over the bar with his left foot from ten yards out. There was one defender there who came across, but that was a clear opportunity. Yeah, it wouldn't have counted. It was offside. He was about four, five yards offside. Well, one yard. But the line span, I don't understand this rule. No, why are they letting it go? It's a great opportunity. Yes, but anything can happen in that move. The player can get injured. Why? Everyone can see that that is offside. Why does he just flag? Yeah, that's what they're told to do. You know what happens in the world of officials if you don't do what you're told to do. But when it's that clear... However, Spain nil, Germany nil. He should have buried it, Ferentore's regardless, and he didn't. He put it over the crossbar by his foot or so. The ball rolls out of play on the far side, throwing to Spain. And it's taken down on the halfway line by Busquets, who nimbly just steps to his right. Another world cup winner on the field down there at the age of 34, Sergio Busquets. And he's rather exaggerated fall by Ferentore's, but he's won the free kick nevertheless. And Carvajal will come up to take it, just spins the ball down on the turf. And we have 10 minutes to go to half time. Spain nil, Germany nil. So we're at a stay like this. Spain would have four points at the top of the group. Germany would be bottom of the group with one point. And it would be very tight, the final set of matches. Balls played over the top, four Spain. Dani Olmo in the inside left position. Zula puts in the challenge and it's bounced away behind. And we have the first corner of the match to Spain. What a great ball over the top. And great defender by Zula. He came back very, very quickly. I was just, because the referee ran all the way back to the halfway line, he's given a corner turn. And I don't know why he did that, but he's now back in his position. But this is where, you know, Germany, they have to be very, very careful. They'd like to defend up high, but they've got to be aware of those runs and the passes. Here comes the corner and it's reached Ferran Torres at the back of the penalty area. Got the ball under control, but while he did, it was closed down by Muzialer, actually it was, who threw himself in front of it and deflected it wide for a corner from the other side. So the Spanish right. He's here, there and everywhere, Ferran Torres. What a great player he's turning out to be. He scored two goals, okay, he was offside a minute ago, he could have scored a third one, had it counted. But I mean, I'm very impressed by the Spanish players, how technically well they are. And they're always in good positions and Ferran Torres, he's got the ball again here. Corner taken short, Dani Olmo with the cross, but it's headed away from near the penalty spot by Zula and Spain go all the way back into their own half. I think the referee, when he went back to the halfway line, suggestion is that Amaric La Porte sort of kicked out when that throw was being taken on the touch line, maybe just to have a little word with La Porte for that reason. So for it again, it goes, bounces nicely for Spain, but that's a heavy challenge centre field by Kera and it's a yellow card for that challenge. He did rather dive in and bring down Ferran Torres, just forward of the centre circle. So the first yellow card of the match and it's Tilo Kera. This is what I'm talking about, they have to, the German players must concentrate every second of this match. So Tilo Kera fell asleep here, didn't see Ferran Torres behind him and there was a crossfield ball that he didn't read, Ferran Torres got the ball and was running towards the goal actually and then he obviously had to chase him and he took him down, a silly yellow card to get. Just an example of how dangerous the Spanish team is. It's actually the first yellow card, either Spain or Germany at this World Cup, Tilo Kera. I find it quite disconcerting that they announced the yellow cards on the public address system in the stadium. Long pass forward, I think in Adri's offside as well, that was quite early by their standards, the offside flag. I think he decided there that he actually couldn't do anything other than flag that as offside, so we did save the flag for the goal. It would have been silly, he was miles off, it would have been silly not to do that. 37 minutes played, Spain nil, Germany nil. This is the World Cup 2022 on 5 live from the BBC. Matches on BBC TV tonight, you can watch it if you're on your way home at the moment and as I say, if you wish to, you could continue to listen to me and Peter on World Cup Extra, on iPlayer along with the pictures, all synced up together. Free kick for Germany, just played back by Rudiger to Neuer, who's made one really good save in this first half. Early on as well, really sharp touch from the terrific shot as well from Dani Olmol, nice header, centrefield by Gundewang. Then it's played out to Gnabry on the right hand side by Muller, Muller makes ground through the middle and then Gnabry is challenged by Jordi Alba, went down, the ball runs out of play. I think that is just giving us a throw in, isn't it? So this should be the second yellow card in this game, because Jordi Alba brought Gnabry down. Gnabry would have been absolutely free on the right hand side, free to go into the box, free to cross the ball. I don't understand why he's not getting a yellow card for that. Germany, they have a free kick and a very, very good and promising position. Out on the right hand side, after Jordi Alba conceded the free kick. So there are two options over there, Spain holding their line on the edge of the penalty area. And the delivery from Kimmich, here it is, into the edge of the penalty area and it's headed down by Rudiger. Germany take the lead, that's just what they wanted. Hansi Flick celebrates on the edge of his coaching area and the goal comes from the set piece and Spain concede for the first time at this World Cup. Spain nail Germany 1. Terrible defending by Spain, trying to hold a high line, not looking at Rudiger whatsoever. I think this might go to VAR because I felt that Rudiger was slightly offside when he was gone. Let's check, you're right Peter. They are checking for offside and the goalie is disallowed. Well that was super quick, that is the semi-automatic system working and it's right, well spotted. He was offside, there's no doubt about that. The port nearly played him onside, the port was the only of the Spanish players following the German players in and he nearly made that mistake. Unfortunately for Germany but what a great header that was. So the German celebrations are cut short by the semi-automated VAR decision, the offside decision and it remains Spain nail Germany nail. I have to say Peter, that's my first experience in a football stadium with the new semi-automated offside. If that's how it works, I know that there was controversy, it almost goes without saying when it was the opening match wasn't it? When it was used and now they're explaining it on the big screens inside the ground as well and showing the graphics. But that's going to work like that and work well, that's good isn't it? I like the speed of it. Normally you wait or... Oh, giving away by Carvajal but then a heavy touch by Canaveral on the edge of the area. That's a real wasted opportunity by Germany there and Spain break forward, the ball is played out towards the left hand side. Dani Almo is there, then there's the overlap from Jordi Alba who crosses it into the defender's zula and it bounces behind for a Spanish corner. It was nearly a free chance for Germany, Mula got the ball past it to Gdavri but his touch was so heavy. And I go back to what I said before, he was one of the players I expected not to play today and so far he has not played very well. Corner then, for Spain on the far side, half time approaching, four minutes to go, we'll have more reaction to well all the day sport coming up and certainly the World Cup matches. Ball into the near post, Wudeke got there, headed away, did well, had to make ground to get there and it's deflected out of play for a throw into Spain off Muziarla. Ten yards back from the corner flag on the right hand side, Dani Carvajal, thickly bearded at the moment, picks up the ball and just looks for the various options. Takes it short, Carvajal makes himself available but Rown is in on the challenge and then Rown throws himself to the ground, ridiculously, and play continues. Balls played back by Mula, Rown who of course is back on his feet now, then clears to the half way line, it's headed forward by Laporte to the edge of the box, Zula was underneath that, up it goes from Gappy to the edge of the penalty area and then it will bounce over the left hand side but back centrally with Asensio, Busquets then plays the ball with such composure from foot to foot. What a sure touch that was wasn't it, just absolute certainty and then the little ball out towards the left hand side and now Pedru, what a bonus it must be for Luis Enrique to be able to name this Barcelona midfield three, as he's midfield three for the Spanish international team, there's bags of talent in there, still 0-0 if you just joined us, half time approaching, Ball played up towards Mula who hasn't had a lot of change, has he out of Rodri and Laporte, Thomas Mula as the centre forward with Kai Haberts left out tonight? Yeah, I think he's done quite well because one of the things he needs to do for the team is to stay patient and stay high, normally with no Mula he will be everywhere in the last third, but he's stayed central, he's kept Rodri and Laporte around him which I think is very good for the team because players like Muziala who's got the ball now gets a bit of room. Strong play from Muziala to take it away from 1-9 and then Busquets put the challenge, brought him down, that's a yellow card, Busquets is booped, so that's one piece now and I think that's a fair decision bearing in mind that Muziala was away from it. It was a fair decision and you could have put Maki on Busquets being the first Spanish player to get a yellow card, he's done this so many times, he does it for the team and now Muziala is in that area all the time around Busquets, he's got to challenge him now. Busquets who's playing in his fourth World Cup, that's class isn't it, high quality, we were talking won't you and I before the match and I was asking you how many World Cups you played in but it was just France 98 and we'll maybe tell the story but you bumped into a man who brought up some old memories for you, Germany have got this free kick, just forward of the centre circle, that Kimmich will take which he does and Rudiger has peeled away to the right hand side, takes it down and shoots and Simon rather juggles it, some patted it away and he patted it on for the head of the defender and rather obliging the ball hit the head of the defender and bounced back into his gloves. That was a really really well worked set piece, the free kick was from 45 yards out, Spain was defending only like 15 yards away, very very high up the pitch and they worked it to Rudiger went to the back post, when he got the ball he hammered it in and that's why the goalkeeper lost it in the first play. Two minutes of time to be played at the end of the first half, we're into that now, still 0-0, Spain 0-Germany 0-Germany, who had a goal ruled out for offside, Rudiger headed, Spain have got it deep inside German territory, he has Danny Olmour, who scored Spain's first goal in the demolition of Costa Rica in the opening match, back to the half way line, now played to his right by Rodry and La Porte is there and then it's dragged back and Spain will start again from the centre circle, now it comes to the right hand side, the Carvajal and then the two central defenders once again find one another, Jordi Alba's ball in, Danny Olmour turns, challenged by Kera, that's a free kick, so it looks as though the first half is going to draw to a close with a set piece opportunity for Spain for a free kick, half way inside there half, out on the left hand side. Yeah, it's an opportunity, set pieces are in modern day football opportunities and we had just been shown a replay of that goal that was disallowed and it was very clearly offside, so that was the right decision, no doubt about that. Spain has got a similar opportunity now, not from the same position but Germany are defending this very very high up the pitch, maybe about 30 yards from goal? Yeah, certainly, almost 10 yards outside the box, it's taken short and then clipped into the back post where it is headed across, then nodded further into the penalty area and there's a little glance and it's rattling around the box, Gavi is onto this and Gavi sees his effort blocked behind for a corner, I think we'll just about have time for that to be taken, make it 10 seconds of the first half still to be played in the two minutes of out of time. We've got two very small Spanish players absolutely terrorizing, Grudiga and Zuley in that defence and it's the only time in the last sort of 15-20 minutes that Germany has looked a little bit unsettled at the back. Daniel Mo to take this one from the right hand side, so way down to our right. Daniel Mo into the edge of the six yard box, it's headed out but it is headed out to Pedri but that's it, that's the end of the first half. Spin nil, Germany nil is the score, really important save from Manuel Neuer early on in the half from Daniel Mo's shot. Germany, couple of opportunities for Canabri and obviously there's the Grudiga header that was ruled offside that he did get into the net but there's not a lot in it, Peter. No, there's not a lot in it, we're watching some of the best teams in the world play, they have actually played very well, we've been treated to some very good football play, not a lot of chances created but the football has been good to watch. And I think that both managers will be in that dressing, quite happy with what they've seen from the first half. Spin nil, Germany nil, last time they played it was six nil, Spin won six nil last time these sides met but this is a very close affair. So that is it, Spin nil, Germany nil and Kelly Cates is here with us in the Old Bate stadium, high in the stands. Thank you very much John, Peter just watching this game it occurred to me that it might have been a very different match had Costa Rica not beaten Japan earlier on. This one seems, there is a slight edge of intensity too but it doesn't have that do or die feel that might have been there. I think that Hansa Flig probably would have approached the game in the same way regardless. So what he is trying to do is just to settle the German team down, not concede early on so he opted to play with the four. The first ten minutes they were a little bit all over the place, they've settled down, which I've criticised a little bit, has actually played really really well. He's had five interceptions in the last half hour where you know in the right position, did the right thing and of course here the last corner kick it was him who headed the ball away. So I think that would have been the plan, they're not playing with an outright striker so it's just trying to keep it a little bit tight and not give anything away. And then of course as this game progresses then you know he can take chances if he feels that there is an opportunity to do that. By the moment it's a point and the point could be very very valuable for Germany. Rafael Honekstein has joined us as well, Rafael Peter was just saying, I know you are making your way up here, this has been the plan for Germany just to try and settle the team after that defeat by Japan and just to give a little bit of confidence, particularly in defence. Do you think it's working? Bayern larger would say yes, I think the team are happier pushing up a bit more and putting more pressure on Spain's build up but you can see the caution, you can see that they are a little bit deeper. And Spain I think have the better structure to their passing, they have more clarity when Germany have the ball, they don't always use it well. But we have seen some of the things they can do, especially when it comes to slightly more direct approach, they have a lot more height, I think they are better in both boxes. You just have to get into the Spanish box, that's the problem. Just a couple of words about Canaveri, I've been critical of him in this first half, actually very critical of him wasting a lot of chances in the game against Japan. Do you think that it will benefit the German team if he was substituted either half time or very early on in the second half and who would you replace him with? There isn't an obvious replacement on the right hand side, you could bring on Jonas Hoffmann who's been good for Germany who has scored goals for Hansi Klick before but he's not quite the same quality. The fact that Leroy Sane is not there, unfortunately still not quite ready to play, makes the team pick itself almost to a certain extent up front. And I think Serge is needed for his space because Germany have big spaces to traverse when they win the ball and he does that very well. He doesn't always look like the most technical, most accomplished players but he is very good when he gets in these one-on-one situations and I think Bayern Larch Flick will probably be happy with him so far. Good, put Thomas Müller out there and put Mokogo up front. I don't think Flick will chase the game at this point, as you said I think the point is a very good result for Germany. It keeps everything in their own hand because they only then need to beat Costa Rica to go through, they will probably not win the group but at this point I think progress is all that matters. So I think they will try to do what they have done in the first half, keep Spain out of the box as well as they can and then just have a bit more quality, a bit more composure on the ball. Which is not easy when they press you so high and they almost play man-to-man in the middle, makes it difficult. How do you think they have defended in this first half? I thought they defended quite well, they got a little bit luckier in times when David Rahm was out of position but recovered just in time to block the shot. Spain also I thought for all the amazing quality they have in passing, if they had a striker who makes that last run rather than checking back and waiting for the ball to feed. I think they are still one of the favourites but they are still in another level still. And Germany got a little bit lucky because of that because I think there were moments when Spain were in that final third and they are looking up and no one has really run across the centre backs. Everyone wanting to beat the ball, play to feed and that is often allowed Germany to recover and get a tackle in. What do you think of that Peter? You asked the question? Yeah, I think the first 10 minutes they were a little bit all over the place. I thought they were finding their feet. I think Spain also they tightened the screw a little bit in the first 10 minutes just to challenge them, just to see are you ready for this. And especially the situation where Sula he slipped when the shot from Jody Alba came in. He slipped and from that moment on he has actually played very very well. His interceptions has been spot on, he has been in the right position or the right plays at the right time. Something that I felt that he wasn't in the Japan game. He looked very very heavy and a little bit out of source, out of position all the time. And not comfortable in that sort of right full back right defending area. Today he has looked different. Rudiger I said Rudiger needed to take charge of defence today, help everybody. I think he has done that. I think he has been excellent. Raum who also I didn't think played too well against Japan has played well today. So I think it looks a little bit better. And of course when you have Noé behind making the save but he made in that, I mean we know that, that transmits into the team straight away and it helps him, it gives him confidence. So I think in that department he has gone well. It's more the last third that I am a little bit worried about because they have been presented with a couple of free chances. One of them, Gnabi got the ball, lost it the heavy touch and it was a little bit the same in the game against Japan. He got into really good positions. He could have finished, he had three chances, he could have shot, well I say could. I mean should have scored on. But there are players, I mean Muziala, he is impressed with me. How good do you think he is? Ridiculously good. He is ridiculously good. Raphael Honextine knows that we need to get to the BBC News.

Earlier today at the World Cup, Canada were the second team knocked out after they lost 4-1 against Croatia. But no fan will forget the team's first ever World Cup goal. It came just 68 seconds into the match. Head coach John Herdman spoke after the game. It was a great start and a proud moment, I think for the fans in the stadium, for people back home. We got to celebrate something that we've been waiting a long time for. I think the second goal turned the tide, that close to half time. You've got to make tactical adjustments coming into the second half, which leaves you open. And when you open yourself up to a team like Croatia, they're going to be clinical in transition. And I thought they gave a masterclass in those transitional moments. But proud, proud of the lads. I thought they had good moments in the second half. I thought they had at times good control and we just couldn't find that equaliser. And the more you pushed, the more you had a risk. I didn't think any of these lads turned away from that opportunity to push for that result, even when we were 2-1, 3-1 down. They all pushed hard and that's what this country wants from their players in respects. That was Jon Herdman talking about Canada's 4-1 defeat by Croatia. Elsewhere in group F today, Belgium would be 2-0 by Morocco. And in group E, which is Spain and Germany's group, Costa Rica beat Japan by a goal to nil.

Remember, all the games in the World Cup are live here on Five Live Sport. This game, though, taking place at the Albate Stadium in Qatar. It's Spain nil, Germany nil as we head into the second half, with Piotr Schmeichel and Jon Murray. Thank you, Kelly. The teams are out. Certainly, Spain have got the full complement up and so have Germany as well. So, Spain with Seymour in goal, Carvajal, Rodri, Laporte and Jordi Alba, Busquets, Gavi and Pedri in midfield, Torres, Essencio and Olmol. And here comes the last man for Germany now, yes. So, they have now got the full 11, Tilo Kera is the last man out of the dressing rooms. And under the field, and the referee is given the nod. Germany then with Neuer in goal, Kera, Zula, Rudiger and Raum, the back four. Three man midfield for this, Kimmich, Goretzka and Gundewan furthest forward. And then Gnabri, Muziala and Mula. We've got a full start at the start of the second half. The referee, Danny Macalee of the Netherlands says, come on, Germany, take it again. Which they do. I'm having to stop and stop watch again, which I've managed to do. So, the ball is played up towards the edge of the Spanish penalty area. Muziala is able to turn it away, the teenager on his right foot comes in field and turns and goes outfield again to the wider area, the cross from round. But that's a comfortable catch from Simon in the middle. So, Piotr Schmeichel, what are we expecting? Do you think in the second half? I think a little bit of the same. The same as we saw in the first half. Spain will try, but they're not going to commit 100% to try to win this game. They will feel they don't really need to take that risk because there are risks. We've just seen Muziala. I don't think he was aware of how freely he was. He was actually inside the box. Had he turned the other way, he would have seen the goal and nobody else, but he turned left and went around. And then, of course, nothing came of that. But I think Germany, again, they know that they've got Costa Rica in the last game and they should be able to beat them and they will probably say, if we can't, there was no place here. So, a point here is it's in their own hands. And so, I think stay tight, stay solid at the back, don't give anything away. And then, if the chance appears, they'll take it. Spain coming forward on the left-hand side. Doni Olmo did well. And it's Flick to Asensio. And Asensio sprints down the left wing with the ball and gets it into the middle, but too close to go. Keep an eye out. In the six-yard box, he was able to go down and gather that quite comfortably. Yeah, a little bit of confusion between Suley and Keela on the halfway line. Here's Juanca Mullert to chase through the middle for Germany. It bounced across his body. He's flicked it back across, but Yordi Alba was able to deal with it, actually. And he's saying Yordi Alba wears the offside flag and then it comes. So, a free kick to Spain. We're not going to waste any time on talking about that rule, either. They just stayed for now and forever. It's silly. What I would point out is that, just to remind everyone, that the teams that get through from this group, so Spain, Germany, Japan, Costa Rica, they will play the two that go through from the Belgium, Morocco, Croatia group. Canada will not go through, so it will be Morocco, Belgium, Croatia, who will play two from those three, which is interesting because Morocco have a chance. They've got their final match against Canada, Belgium play Croatia, and it's entirely possible that Morocco could win that group, but we'll see what happens. So, but listen, when it comes to a Morocco tournament, you can't pick your opponents, can you? I'm not sure that necessarily is a good draw. I think Morocco has been one of the big, big positive surprises in this tournament and how they played today. It's very, very impressive. They are growing as a footballing nation and they're growing with confidence as well, so I don't see why that necessarily is a good draw. Well, it is. Sometimes a case of be careful what you wish for. I remember very well England ending up with Iceland, Euro 2016, and everyone knows what happened next. I wasn't going to mention that. No, well, that's very kind of you. Spain, NIL, Germany, NIL. NIL, essential, plays it for Daniel Mordek. Really good work at that easily, just to slide the ball back to Noyet, which he is at, from the penalty area to Zula, passes it up the line to Ganabri, and then in comes the challenge on him, but Ganabri was looking for that, threw himself down, and eventually it's out of play for what is given as a throw to Spain. So, NIL, NIL, very early stages. Spain get a point, they'll be top of the group and they will know that if they win against Japan on the final night in this group, they will go through as group winners. But let's see what happens over the course of the next 45 minutes first. It's at the back with Le Porte, who gives it back to Gorky back, Simon, on the edge of his six-yard box. He is overconfident in possession. Simon, there was a couple of moments ago when he had two Germans, maybe four or five yards away, either side of him, and just very coolly played it between the two of them. And then Spain don't get it away actually, playing it out, and it is not in-field towards Gundawan who went down, and he does get the free kick, not too far away from the left corner of the penalty area. Busquets, who's already been booked, pretests, but it's a free kick and a good position for Germany. And it's a really good bit of pressure from Germany, keeping the Spanish team in their own half, nearly by the corner flag actually, and their rewards for that bit of pressure is a free kick. In the promising situation, this, you know, it's a little bit long distance to have a shot at goal, but it's possible to the right further. The right position as well. Yes, but this is probably going to be a cross, it's a great position to be in. Kinnich looks historic. Well, it could be an in-swinger, or it could be a delivery to the back post, let's see. They've left both options open. Spain are holding their line outside the penalty area. The free kick's on the left, the referee says, come on, let's have it. And Kinnich plays it in beyond the back line, and it's a poor delivery. Poor delivery. Had it been a good delivery, they would have been outside again. Very, very brave play by Spain. Normally, you know, you would follow the players that runs into the box, you follow them in, but every single one of them just stood still and let the Germans run into that trap. But it was a bad delivery, and nothing came off it. No, Spain have got it. Spain, NIL, Germany, NIL inside their own half on this very, very mild night inside the stadium with the air conditioning. Certainly you wouldn't describe it as hearted. It's just the perfect temperature. That's how it feels sitting high up here. The floodlights brightly on these stadiums are brilliantly lit, it must be said. And this one that we're sitting in here, which is way up in the north, we're on the fringes of the desert here. In fact, the roundabout an hour to get back into central Doha from where we're sitting. And we're watching Spain playing the ball forward into centre midfield, and then it finds its way to Yordi Alba, who's got space in front of him. He takes it on now, but then checks back because Gnabry is there next to him. And Spain in the red kit with the yellow numbers on, played to Daniol Mo, way down in front of Luis Enrique, who's pacing around. He's almost all in black tonight, Luis Enrique. And still Spain have possession, Busquets stretches for it, then plays it forward. Now it's been carried deep into German territory by Pedri, or it was until the challenge came in from Kera, which put it out for a throw just in front of the Spain dugout. Throw in taken by Yordi Alba, back to Pedri. Now into the centre circle to Rodri. And then Spain advance down the right flank with Carvajal. But it comes to nothing, Germany clear again to the half way line. It's knotted forward in a slipped in field, but that's to Gundawan. And Gundawan goes for the early ball over the top, but Gnabry won't reach that. Just had too much on it from the Manchester City midfielder, and Simon was able to take the bouncing ball in the edge of his penalty line. Yeah, that's got to be spot on that pass, if that's going to come off with a goalkeeper, that proactive in whatever happens on the pitch. But again, it's brilliant to watch Spain, how they play, how they move. We're set very, very high up. So how we see it, it really is good to see. But there are opportunities for Germany. If they get the ball, those passes are on all the time. Danny Olmore receives it on the left-hand side, takes on Kera, gets passed in, but the ball bounces away off the Spaniard's right foot, and all the way through for a goal kick. He's been quite secure, Kera. It was an issue, wasn't it, who was going to play it right back for Germany? And the West-Hand man who has played it right back, he's played in central defence for David Moyes this season. I think it works for Germany. They look more stellar than they're said in the four. That's it for Ferran Torres. Eight minutes into the second half. And it looks like a practical change, because Ferran Torres is actually running off the field. I mentioned that 6-0 last time Spain and Germany met. He scored a hat-trick in that match, Ferran Torres. But that's it. And so it's Alvaro Marata who's coming on, so they're going to have their centre-forward through the middle. And it only comes, and there's great applause, actually, from the Spanish supporters behind that goal-treller left, colourfully dressed in the red and yellow, of course, the national colours of Spain. So Marata is on the much-travelled Alvaro Marata. Who did score the final goal with the seventh goal against Costa Rica in the opening match. And so Asensio has moved out towards the right-hand side. And Asensio takes the throw for Marata, who takes it on, down into the full-back position. But he is dispossessed, and Germany have it back and play it back to Ruedegat inside the penalty area. And we're looking across the six-yard box to Manuel Neuer, Spain, NIL, Germany, NIL, Neuer, all in yellow down there, passes it to Gnabry on the half-way line. But Dani Olmol finds the ball at his feet, and then can't do anything with it, and Germany have got it back. And Marata, Spain's number seven, has gone directly into the number nine position, as you just said there, and maybe an opportunity, the tactical opportunity is putted now. Because there has been a lot of play across the field, and nothing sort of up towards the German goal. So Marata is on to win what is his 59 caps, the 28 international goals, with now 59 appearances. Throwing taken for Spain. It's angled back towards the edge of the penalty area. The Germany clear at the scene, it was almost in the centre circle, out of his penalty area, so quickly to get there ahead of Mullen, and right-shot quality of the way downfield out of play. I don't know why you sound so surprised. This is why he's playing. This is the reason that David Leer is not involved. He doesn't play like that. And Luis Enrique wants his goalkeeper to do that. By having a goalkeeper doing that, you can play a high line nearly up the half-way line. So anything that goes over the top, he will deal with that. And it frees up other players to keep the session. Spain, with the ball inside the box, back it comes again, and he's played it out, Simon, and Germany have put it back, and Gunduan is onto this, onto his right foot. Plays it across, super safe by Simon, from the shot from Kimmich, from inside the area, and he's made up for his mistake there. The footwork let the goalkeeper down, the Spanish goalkeeper, but he redeemed himself with the save to his right. The thing is, he looks a little bit stupid in this situation, given the ball away, but I think he has to play like that. He's asked to play like that. You can see how the players are running towards him, asking for the ball. The pass was not too bad, but the pressure from Germany is very good, and he ended up producing a very good save to keep the game at Niel Niel. Corner event to Germany. I think this is their first corner. Yes, it is Germany's first corner of the match from the left. Here's the delivery. That is whipped into the near post and cleared away by Morata, who is there in position to do exactly that with his right foot, but it's come back to the corner table, Kimmich, but he was dispossessed, and Spain now will bring it towards the half-way line. Actually, that's quite a challenge on the Asensio, and out will come the yellow card, and there it is, being shown very clearly. Over there to Goretzka, who does the old puts his hands on his head, bends his knees. I can't believe that you've given that, but it's a free kick. I'm a little bit with him on that, because the whole moves, it starts with Asensio actually holding him back. That's where the free kick starts from. It's a little bit of a six of one half, doesn't it, the other, but in the manner that Asensio goes down, that doesn't do Goretzka any favours. So second yellow for Germany. There was a picture there on the TV of Hansi Flick. He looks tired and under pressure, doesn't he? Well, he made a brilliant start, didn't he? To his tenure in charge of Germany as Spain. Danny Olmog will have a goal here from 25 yards, but straight up Kjolki Bagnoya, who has just a drop down on the 1 million, and he can gather it securely in. So he's had two incredible shots, and then one not so good, but you've got to really, really hit them well to beat one of the best goalkeepers in the world, ever. Ever. From that distance. That was straight out of it. Spain, Nill, Germany, Nill. Both falls for Germany in the centre-circle. And it's Macialla who turns, and Macialla now runs towards the edge of the Spanish penalty area and uses round on the left in the full-back position, and Ranscross is really cool. And Muller's in the middle, there are three Germans in the middle in the penalty area, and Muller turns to round and berates him. Yeah, he hasn't got a case there. I think Ranscross really well there. He took a touch, he was left, and then across the ball straight away, it was a really, really good cross. But this is it, Germany, they don't have an outright striker, so that instinct of actually thinking that the ball's going to end up there isn't with any of the German players. Free kick for Spain, Daniel Moller was caught by Kimmich, and the two of them slapped hands, but that's a yellow card for Kimmich. I just thought it might be there, you know, and the body language of the referee suggested he did not like that challenge on Daniel Moller, and as he walked over, and I think that is a yellow card, it was a stretch by Kimmich, and he caught him, he was laid, caught him on the, just above the ankle, on the lower shin, so a third yellow card for Germany. And back to Hansy Flick down there and his bright white trainers. He won his first eight matches as the German manager after taking over after the Euros from Joachim Lörd, as his side now come forward through the middle. Nice change of feet by Muziala, who goes between two Spanish players. You know, he's really caught the eye again tonight. This time he's fouled by one of the youngsters on the Spanish side, Gabi, the 18-year-old, so that's the 18-year-old fouling the 19-year-old, and it's a free kick for Germany. What a prospect he is for Germany, Muziala. Strong, isn't he? You could have, as we said, you could have played for England, he's chosen to play for Germany. And, I mean, he, as you say, he's catching the eye. What he's doing, it's not just that he's doing little tricks and stuff, it's also his, the selection of what he's doing. Nearly every decision he makes, or has made in this game so far, has been the correct one. Free kick, finished to take it, and he's going to flight it in. Looking for Rudy, Gab, he again peeled away and found the position, but it was overhooked from the free kick from Kimmich, I'm afraid, and all the way through goal kick. Spain are very brave when they defend those free kicks. They're very high up the pitch, and it needs a very precise delivery. If we've seen that in the first half, if it happens well, then it's dangerous for Spain. Marata plays it out to the right-hand side. Muziala is there, left footed ball right across the pitch to Daniolamo, who chess that down now, and now into the penalty area, in comes the challenge. Good one from Kera, did well there against Daniolamo inside the penalty area, so he couldn't make any slips in there, but he didn't dispossess Daniolamo. It's been a good contest, those two together. They've each had little victories. And the moment, it's Kera who's got the upper hand in that, too. Now Spain again, Busquets this time to Daniolamo. He's joined by Yordi Alba on the left-hand side. Yordi Alba's ball in, and then he pulls! Brilliant! Brilliant flick! With the outside of his boot, Marata! That was the centre-fool, it's finished for Spain in the six-yard box. Flash past Neuer, who hangs his head in disappointment. One-nil Spain lead! What a fantastically well-willed goal. We're just talking about Daniolamo, losing the Dural with Kera. It wasn't Daniolamo passing the ball, but it was from his side. He'd gone inside, left the space, and the pass into Marata was perfect. The television cameras are focusing on the Spanish players' celebration. But I can see right below the Spanish technical team were celebrating with the coach, because he's just made that decision to put him on. Changed it a little bit. Whoa, we've just seen that. What a great fade-in. It's the pass, it's perfect, and the run is the centre-fool, walks Yordi, comes in with the outside of his foot, and it puts him over Manuel Neuer, nearly in the top corner. One-nil Spain! The goal coming in the 62nd minute. So remember, it's not terminal if Germany lose this match tonight, because of the Costa Rica victory earlier in the day. However, they would be going into the final group match against Costa Rica without a point. And now the ball is played for again for Spain, but Neuer is able to come out and take this up. Being up for all of the talk of false names and whatever tactical thing that you do up front, sometimes you just can't beat having a centre forward, and Marata delivered. But Germany now coming forward, and that's a good header away from Yordi Alba at the other end outside the talks. Shot from Kuretska, that was blocked inside the penalty area, and then Daniel Morsfeld by Gnabry, and that is a free-kick to Spain on the edge of their own thoughts. It's interesting to see how Germany are going to react to this. Are they going to make changes? Are they going to put more strikers on? Is there a chance that they will be able to score a goal? Will they be satisfied with a 1-0 defeat and take their chances against Costa Rica? At the moment Spain are playing in a way that if they take chances, they leave too much space for them to play around in, and of course with Marata on the pitch. They've got a goal scorer as well. So let's see what happens in the next 5-10 minutes. I think what's interesting is having taken the lead, it looks like it's Luis Enrique, who's going to make the two changes. Next, a double substitution. Koke is going to be one of them, so just to firm things up a bit in midfield I think, and actually they're playing it forward. Daniel Morsfeld now up to the edge of the penalty area, plays it square, it's allowed to run, what a chance for a sensio on the edge of the box, and he almost falling, hits the shot, and he had time there, and he scooped it over the crossbar, and that was rather wasteful. It was rather wasteful, the ball was a little bit behind it, it was passed along the 18-yard line, it was just a tiny little bit behind him, and he scooped it over the bar. Germany, the team was split in two. Germany, half of the team was running back trying to defend, half of the team stayed up, so it's like they are going to take some chances now. Well, it's Nico Williams who's coming on as well for Spain, the winger from Athletic Bilbao, so it is a double change, and first of all, coming off to Spain, it is a sensio, so that is his last contribution, so his place is going to be taken by Nico Williams on the right wing, and the other change, you'll see Gaby come off, so the right side is central midfield of the Barcelona line, and on comes the great Atletico Madrid, Captain Koke, absolutely part of the furniture, at Atletico Madrid almost 600 appearances for Atletico Madrid's first team, so a double change, that's three changes that Luis Enrique has made now, Germany coming forward, but that comes to nothing, as Muziala took it into the penalty area, but it got away from him, and it's through for a goal kick, and the other thing as well, great celebrations, as that would be when Spain scored that goal, Luis Enrique jumping around in jubilation, but many of his coaching staff and the players going to him in there, and he did say before the match today, Germany just playing the ball at Spain, playing the ball out from the back, and it's hit long downfield into the centre circle, and Muziala heads it forward, but Spain are on for this, and it is four against four, and now Marata through the middle, trying to take the ball into his path, actually swept it beyond himself and through to goalkeeper Neuer. We've got so much space now, Spain, and Marata is now in between the two centre halves, Zule and Rudiger, trying to outrun them, this time Zule just got a foot to it, and nearly perfect pass. One-nil Spain lead, Germany thought they'd taken the lead towards the end of the first half when Rudiger headed in, but the semi-automated offside ruled that one out, so just the one goal so far, and it's gone to Spain, that excellent finish, sort of flashing finish in the six yard box with his right foot passed Manuel Neuer by Alvaro Marata. What a fantastic, what a fantastic, you will work goal, the passing in that move was just really, really good, and that final pass into Marata, it was in perfect, it was at the right pace, it was at the right angle, and it was just in perfect for his outside foot, not chip it in, but on the outside foot, nearly in the top corner over Neuer. So that is his second goal scored in both matches, that this World Cup never played in a World Cup before, and now two goals in two appearances, and with that he is in the conversation for the Golden Boot, isn't he? Certainly playing for this Spanish team who could go a long way in the tournament. Spain with Nico Williams on the right hand side, I think just come on, he's challenged and the ball is out of place, they're throwing. Germany are going to make substitutions now, I think he's going to put three players on. Sané is one of them, Leroy Sané, who's had an injury, was doubtful for this game, before Manchester City man, knee injury, but is among the substitutes today, and looks as though he's about to get involved in the action for the first time. Lucas Kostermann as well, the defender is there, and also it is Nicholas Fulton who is going to come on, and then Spain play forward from the right, but Maira will come and reach that first with his right foot, and lofted away downfield, Gunduan playing it past Busquets, and then carrying the ball to the outside but winning a throw in Fjord i Alben. I think they'll see the changes now, so looking forward to seeing Nicholas full Krug live, not done that before, he's sort of been propelled into the picture here, and first of all though, Germany are going to take off Gunduan. That's an interesting choice. Yeah, he came off in the first game as well, I wonder if he feels that he can play 90 minutes. Thomas Muller coming off as well, so full Krug will replace Thomas Muller, and Kera is also coming off, so Kostermann will play right back in place of Kera. So Kera, Muller and Gunduan are the three to leave the field, so a triple change for Germany. Spain won Germany nil, and this is a scoreline that mathematically it wouldn't be certain that Spain had clinched their place in the last 16, but it would be one of those, they're all but through because of their superior goal difference in the group, and the fact that they would have six points out of six, so they will confirm their place almost certainly. When it comes to the final matches on Thursday, and Spain will play Japan, who will have plenty to play for. Germany with the ball in front of their own penalty areas, out to the left-hand side. And then back it comes to Neuer in the penalty area, passing it out from the back to Zula, and then forward into the centre-circle, now to the right-hand side. So the newly arrived Leroy Zane, who started on the right flank, and Zane plays it, but it's blocked by the defender, and then Dani Olmo is onto that, forward again, no Muziala, Muziala just outside the box to his left to Zane, square from Zane, it's allowed to run by Goretzka, round was onto the ball, then the ball now over on the left-hand side, which is given away, groans from the German supporters, and actually Spain can be away on the counter-attack. Morata plays it to Williams, and Williams now takes it into the German half, but there's little support there from anyone in red, and Williams has taken it up to the edge of the box, and flips it across the penalty area, bit into the path of Zula, who will get it away. Yeah, we're worried for an interesting ending to this game. Germany are going for it, they're committing people forward, and of course that leaves a lot of room for Spain to counter, and they only have two. Germany only got to get it wrong one time, then they're two-nil down, so let's see what happens. So, full crook through the middle, Muziala playing just off him, in the number 10 position, so he's moved into the position that Gundawang was playing, we've got Zane on the right, and Canaveri has gone across to the left-hand side now. Spain won Germany-nil, five-live, and BBC sounds live from Qatar, here inside the Albeid Stadium. Muziala on the right-hand side, he's done well again, he's got past Dani Homo, and Muziala plays it into the middle, and full crook was there, and he managed to get around Rodry, but he stumbled, the ball bounced off him, and wide and behind in a goal kick. And precisely like Spain put Marathe on, at number nine, a true number nine, full crook just showed himself as that as well. Germany haven't had that option at all, all the way throughout this game, it was a great cross into the box, it could have been one-one, it should have been one-one, and if not, it should have been a corner. So, Spain won Germany-nil, full crook, who's a big guy, six-foot-two, the Werder Bremen striker, ten goals this season, the ball's played through to Muziala, who shoots, it hits Simon, there is no offside flag, the ball is headed away from near the penalty spot, still in the area, Canabri tries a snapshot from the left side of the box, no offside flag, the corner is given, Germany's way, and it just feels that those changes have lifted Germany. Yes, absolutely, there's a bit of youth, there's a bit of technique, there's a bit of pace coming on the pitch, but this is a massive chance, it's Muziala who gets a chance, he's played so well, I would have wished for him to have put that in the back of the net, but great goalkeeping by Simon. Here's the corner, but it's headed up and over the top, by full crook, who managed to find a position for that but couldn't direct it down and on target, but he's already had two chances full crook since coming onto the game, and that was a big opportunity for Muziala, not taken. We're just seeing the angle from behind the goal here, he's one-on-one with Simon, but he actually kicks it straight at him, I think anything low either side of the goalkeeper, he would have gone in. Spain take it away, and now we're seeing exactly what Peter Schmeichel suggested in the spaces potentially opening up for Spain when they come forward, so in fact they go to the half-way line through Dani Olmo, but he's quite rugged isn't he, full crook, the number nine who was promoted with Verda Bremen last season, so he was in playing in the second tier in Bundesliga 2 last season, he's come from almost nowhere really, because of the derp and because of injuries as well, Timo Verna's injured and not able to play at this World Cup, so in he comes, and now he's involved in a crucial match for Germany. Yeah, Germany historically, they've had players you know of that side, I don't even remember, Horst Rubisch, who actually did really well for Germany, it's an option, you can pass the ball up to him, he's physically strong. Ball's played through to Marat, there's no flag, takes it into the area on the right-hand side, he's got a lot to do against Zula, plays it though, Williams on the edge of the box who took a heavy touch, but Spain and Williams still in possession in the end, well that's the latest flag of the night, calm down Peter, I think you're going to come, self-combust here, but it is given as an offside flag, and Germany have given it away though, so Spain are back in possession, back it comes centrally, Pedri out to the left-hand side, and Luis Enrique is extremely animated as the ball comes out towards this side of the field just in front of him, I do remember Horst Rubisch, Peter I remember being allowed to stay up and watch the 1980 European Championship Final, when I think Horst Rubisch scored the winner. He did, and sometimes it's good to have a player like that, someone who can fight for the ball, if you have to go, you know, the last five, six, seven, eight minutes, you have to try to bombard with long balls into the area, someone who can take that fight up and then whatever drops down, somebody else could be there. So, I've had a few balls over the years, I was just thinking, all of the Biajof who's been involved in the German setup for a long, long time, and even Karsten Janker, do you remember him? Karsten Janker, Bayern Munich, I remember him very, very well played against him many times. He was uncomplicated, wasn't he? He was 15 minutes to go, so the goal difference comes into play for sure, the way it is now. So, what's Germany going to do? Are they going to go all out to get a goal, or... and leave Spain all the space, let them come at them? Yes, Canabri on the left-hand side, and it comes to the halfway line to Rudiger. The other thing is, with this score line, Spain won Germany nil. That means that Spain and Japan could draw their final match, and Germany would be out, whatever they do. So, there are lots of things to think about here. Germany are pressing down the left-hand side, with round. Round takes it past Williams, but it gets away from him. I think the final touch though was off the Spaniard, so it was played away by Carvajal. But Germany have won it back with Canabri, and here's the cross, but he was out of place as the referee. It should have been given out that it was a throwing, which is going to be taken on the far side for Spain. Spain won Germany nil. I mean, Germany are going to be... It's going to be a perilous situation for them, and yes, they've got Costa Rica in their final match, but... the table will not look pretty for them, if this is the final score line. No, but we've seen, historically again, we've seen teams struggling in the group phase, and they only just sneak through into the next stages, they knock out stages, and then go on to win it. Go back to... Is it Italy in 82? Was it Italy? Yeah, in three points. And then they ended up winning the World Championship. It's happened before, but as you say, with this score line, a draw between Spain and Japan, it doesn't matter what Germany then do. Muziala playing it in field, but that's... In between the two, his two team mates, and Busquets was able to say, thank you very much, and then the ball is put out of play by Kimmich for a throw into Spain 15 yards inside their own heart. Busquets again in that central midfielder role has been absolutely magnificent today. It doesn't look of much, but he's here there and everywhere, protecting his defenders, and also taking part in open play. Yeah, Busquets winning what is his 141st cap tonight, only Sergio Ramos and Ica Casillas have more caps for Spain. Germany coming forward though, and it's Zula who's joined the attack. And now Zane slips it between two Spanish players back to Zane again, who did very well to take the ball on into the penalty area, but he was off balance and he ended up as the challenge came in on the ground and the ball had gone. But Germany now with full crook, there's real urgency here, and the number nine runs into... Well, he's blocked according to the referee on the edge of the penalty area, and it's going to be a free kick to the Germans three or four yards outside the box. They're actually appealing for a penalty here, a handball, oh yes it is. It's a handball by Busquets, and the VAR should have a look at this. Well, it seemed to strike, it depends how much they feel that the hand was in a natural position, and how close it was as well, the proximity, the ball was knocked up by Zane, but it seemed to me as though Busquets, there seemed to be a motion towards it, or whether that was just the way his arm was naturally swinging. It's very difficult to judge, and we of course, we have the luxury of seeing that back in slow motion. Well, they must have looked at it and decided no. So the appeal, make a note of it anyway. When I saw it in slow motion, I thought that was a penalty. I thought the VAR would have a look at it. However, it's a free kick after the foul by Rodry. So it's a free kick in a good position, that is struck into the wall by Kimmich, from the angle towards the left-hand side, and from there, the wall did its job, deflected it wide at the goal and out towards the corner flag, so a German corner from the left-hand side. And time running out for Germany in this match. Alba, a roll, Marata gave them the lead in the 62nd minute. We now have less than 10 minutes to play. In comes the corner, which is headed away by Marata, comes out to Zane, but Zane trying to push in the ball across, has given it straight away to Spain, and they're off in the counter-attack with Williams, but good work, good pace actually from Round to get back there with Williams, so you could chase that, good race between the two of them, and the German left-back got there first. Another Spanish change came in. They really well today, Round, really, really well. He has, and Fulcrum gets up and wins the header, and it leaves Rodry on the ground. I think he might have landed on him. Jody Albert is actually who is feeling the base of his back, and in any case, he's going to be substituted, because Alejandro Balde is going to come on to replace him. So he is the number 14 for Spain, and this is his second cap, having been drafted in as a late replacement in this squad for Jose Gaya. So the 19-year-old who has made great strides this season for Barcelona is going to replace Jody Albert, his clubmate, who is putting under real pressure, actually, on the home front, so he's got it, he's very often taken his place in the Barcelona team, and now he's replaced him in the Spanish team, so Alejandro Balde, who only made his first team debut in September, and here we are in November, and he's playing for Spain in the World Cup. That's a story, 19-years-old, Germany coming forward, and he obviously is trusted by Luis Enrique to come into this, for Germany. With Fulcrum, Jody scored! Brilliant super finish, and the German number nine has come to the rescue of Hansy Flick and his team, the big bustling, Nicholas Fulcrum. What a finish that was, high above Simon, and it's Spain won, Germany won. And again, this was a goal created by substitutes, Sani, who's made an impact from coming on, got the ball, passed it in to the Muziala, yes, Muziala, and then Fulcrum got the ball from an ankle, and he absolutely smashed it up in the top corner. No chance for Simon. What an impact the substitutions have had in this game, one-one. That was right foot, Wallop. My goodness, he hit that. Hitted high into the roof of the net beyond Simon, and what a way to score your first goal at a World Cup. I mean, he was nowhere, he was nowhere near the squad. When I saw Germany just a couple of months ago in the Nations League, no one was talking about Nicholas Fulcrum, and here we are in Dullhaar, and he's just scored for Germany. And the celebrations on the German bench, Hanser Flick and his coaching staff were congratulating themselves with, of course, the goal, but it came from the substitute. And Germany are making a substitution now. Yep. The goal is announced, he's only making a change. There's Gnabry coming up, isn't it? Hoffman, who is coming on into the midfield, and, yes, Serge Gnabry is making way. So Gnabry, who started on the right, moved to the left, so Jonas Hoffman is coming on. I saw him score for Germany against England. In Munich, in June, in the Nations League, and Hoffman takes up a position out towards the left-hand side, so that is where Gnabry was playing laterally in the match. So Jonas Hoffman, with Ben Mnabry, and Mnabry is into the action. Score, Spain won, Germany won. So that does change things, tightens it up again. Spain would have four points, Germany would have one, and Japan and Costa Rica both with three in between them. So Germany will feel a lot better about themselves after that, and the ball is out of play for a goal kick. Spanish players going down, Cooke was though he's been torqued, I'm not sure what happened there, he's just holding his face, and Rudigo was involved in there, there was an arm, there wasn't a break, you know, I'm not kidding. We have been treated to a fantastic contest there. A lot of technical skills at the highest level, and also this excitement, seeing new players. Is that Germany come forward, they're thinking about perhaps getting a second goal now, the ball through the middle, that was for Hoffman, and for Moussiala to chase, but Spain just about doubt with that. Germans are going to make another change as well, Nikol Schlotterbeck who is left out today after the opening match, Schlotterbeck, the central defender, Spain playing it forward. They've been unsettled by that, conceding a goal for the first time at this World Cup, 83rd minute, so the Spanish lead lasted for just over 20 minutes, so Schlotterbeck will come on to replace Rall. So three central defenders now, it would look like, Rall coming off from left back, and Schlotterbeck coming on to play, perhaps as the left-sided central defender, we'll see. So, on he comes, and Rall has left the field on the far side. So Spain won, Germany won, just over three minutes to play. Five Live Sports tonight will be an air for another hour of sorts, and round up the day's action in the World Cup. Five Live Breakfast will be back on air, 6am in the morning with Rick Edwards here in Qatar, and I hear that Chris Sutton will be taking on the board of challenge in the morning, and I'll just ask you to do that when you're on Five Live Breakfast, Peter. How many did you get? Yes, I managed to avoid it, but I was listening, I was actually standing by. You should never say that on air. I was standing by to come on after you, and I was thinking he's going to do it here, but you never did. So still less time yet, it's a long tournament. Well, I've heard a lot of excuses, I've got my own. I thought the questions would be asked too slow. Ah, right, OK. Spain won, Germany won. You're not the first person to say that, is you, David? Throw in four Spain, and forward it goes, towards the half-way line, and deflected out of play. Germany has stayed forward in the back, so not a tactical change, basically just energy, I think. I thought Ram has played very well, he's been up and down, up and down, so maybe there was nothing left in the tank for him. Yeah, they have stuck to the back 400, a shot at that, playing as the left back. Spain played with a half-way line, bounces into the centre circle, comes back to Ruedega, Ruedega taps it forward, less than two minutes to play now. Germany, you can tell here from the body language, the way that they scored that goal, the way that it's lifted them, they are thinking they might be able to snatch this. It was a very well-crafted goal, it all came from Leroy Sahn, his move, we got the ball on the right-hand side, and on his left foot went in field, and then that square passed in to Muziala, who left it for Fulcrum, who came around him, and their finish was just fantastic. Spassed it up in the top corner, the far corner, no chance for the goalkeeper. He's got a touch of the bygone days about him, Fulcrum, he's missing a tooth, so they call him in Germany, Luka, which is the German for gap, and now the balls play through for Morata inside the penalty area on the right, but good tackle from Flotterbeck, who slid in there, just come onto the field, and that was danger, danger, because Morata was getting ready to shoot, he had the time that right-hand side. Morata was one-on-one with Manuel Neuer, only six, seven yards from goal, but what a tackle, and he got an imperfect right, anything wrong there, and Spain would have got a penalty for sure. Super tackle with his left foot, curling it around Morata, which is showing us the replay there, and he sort of punched the air in celebration that he made the tackle, well done, well done, Lucas. Corner taken, short by Spain, Williams, and then in comes the challenge on him from Kimmich, but Spain's still in possession, it comes in field, but they'll both flick towards the edge of the box, and almost onto that into the area, but Kimmich did well actually as well, good defending Germany, and it's cleared away towards the halfway line, and Spain will start again. We're in the 90th minute now, actually the fourth official will be coming forward with the board, here we go, and it's six minutes, I can see, they've already put it up, six minutes to play, six minutes to decide if there is going to be a win at in this match between the two full-match World Cup winners. Spain passing it forward, out towards the right-hand side, and then a little bolder, Coké, Coké goes back behind him to Rodgerie, and crossed it in Ritala Port. And Rodgerie has a little look forward, thinks about the long pass, but then goes square, and they're just going to take the sting out of this a little bit, I think, Spain here, because Germany with the goal gathered some momentum in the match, and Spain are looking just to calm things down again, because the draw, of course, is absolutely fine for them. They know that if they win against Japan in the final matches in the group, and they've all played at the same time, of course, on Thursday, they will go through as group winners, Spain, with Daniel Molina, and the left-hand side, Molina goes back into his own half to La Port, and then back it goes again into the heart of defence. So, it's a defensive, if Japan beat Spain, and Germany still wins against Kota Riga, then it's Japan-Spain, isn't it? As the ball comes to the edge of the pen of the area, it's cleared away by Germany on the edge of the box. If Germany win, they'll have four points, and then Spain will have four points, Japan will have six, so that would be... Down to gold score. So, this is the tournament, Germany, you've got the... Spain have got the massively great at-goal difference, so Germany and Spain are in a very strong position regardless. Here's Daniel Molina cutting in from the left-hand side, in comes the challenge, but the ball is cleared away up towards Muzi Arla, but it is a free kick that is given to Germany as well, free kick near the edge of their box. I think Nick Zula today has played exceptionally well. I thought he looked very, very heavy in the first game against Japan, but today he's really defended well. Every decision he's made has been the correct one. Nikko Schlotterbeck with a good crossfield pass to Muzi Arla. Leroy Zane is going to take this on, but Spain have got plenty of bodies back behind the ball now. Essentially Goretzka shuffles it to the left-hand side to Schlotterbeck. Now back to Rudiger, square from him to Zula. We've had almost three minutes of added time, six have been indicated. The ball is headed back, that's a cheap one, that's a cheap corner, and it's behind by Carvajal. It's a silly thing to do. This is when it's in the DNA, always to keep the ball. The ball is crossed from maybe 30 yards out, at a very direct angle. If he leaves it, it might go up for a throw-in, and he tries to head it back to Simon, and what he's done instead is headed it out. Germany now have a corner kick. You think about the players Germany have, Fulcrum, Zula, Rudiger in there, this is a great chance for Germany. He takes substitutes as well with Schlotterbeck having come onto the field. Carvajal could have done almost anything with that, but headed it behind. So it is a corner for Germany. From the left in the referee, you can hear the whistle, that he's just coming across referee Macherli to have a word, something he's seen in the six yard box. So, right, hang on to your hats, Germany with a corner. Fulcrum makes a run to the near post, here's the delivery to the back post. Rudiger was after it, but defender jumped in front of him, and Rudiger didn't get there, and in actual fact, it was beyond everyone, bounced through and out for a throw-in over here on the right-hand side. The Spanish player has gone down. It's Buster. Back on his feet now, though, throwing to Germany. Throw in for Germany on the edge of the six yard box. Kostomun is going to take this, just takes a couple of steps back. He's got three short options, and he uses the Muziala option. Williams is back in there, and Williams wins it from Muziala. Clears it, Rudiger just hoists it straight up in the air almost. Two Germans go for it, I think there was a clash of heads in there, so the referee should stop play. He hasn't. Muziala plays it to the left-hand side. Spain are going to break away. Williams is now carrying it downfield, and in comes the challenge, and that's a good one as well. Let's go. That's a same there. Schlauerteper has passed it forward, and now this could open up for Germany. Simon comes out, the balls pull back, full crooks in the middle, but it might actually have been carried behind by Leroy Zane, was it, or did he pull it back in time? It's a corner, I mean, it's made such a difference that Leroy Zane has come on the pitch. If he hasn't been fit, he certainly looks fit now. It may have just made the wrong decision there to go with his left foot, go left. He should have made it cut in, or finished the ball, but he's managed to get Germany another corner, and again, it's another opportunity for Germany to get all the points here. That looked like that ball was over the line before Zane pulled it back, but it has been ruled not to have been, so it is a German corner into the six-yard box. What a good catch by Goalkeeper Simon. What a good catch, and that is it. That's the last action. I made that 15 seconds early, but the final whistle has gone. It has finished Spain one, Germany one, so Spain's destiny with this is very much in their own hands. Germany are still in it, but they're bottom of the group going into the final round of matches. For Spain four points, Japan and Costa Rica three, Germany one. So they've got their first point, and the two coaches there, Luis Enrique and Hansi Fleck just came grace down on the side of the pitch. What do you think, Peter Schmeichel? I think we were treated to a great game of football. The players that played, they gave everything, a lot of fantastic play, especially by Spain. But Germany also had some really good moves. We've seen some young players in action today. The one that really caught my eye was Muziala. How well did he play? What a great, great player he promised us to be. I also have to say the Dutch referee today, he helped the game by the line that he was laying for this. He let it go, and it just became a much, much better game of football because of that. His decisions were spot on, but I have to say, I am well impressed by Germany, how they reacted to what happened a couple of days ago. And of course, we saw Spain under pressure. They are good enough to deal with that. So if Spain win, and Germany win on the final night of matches, they're both through. Spain will win the group, Germany will finish second. But I guess Japan and Costa Rica might have something to say about that. But we'll see on the final night of Group E, which will be on Thursday. But that's it tonight. The draw. Spain won, Germany won.",
