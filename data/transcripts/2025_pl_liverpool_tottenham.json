  "transcript": " Football's on, bit the corner, buddy. We should do that one someday. It's not bad, is it? Stunning. Liverpool are defending the Cop in the first half, as we're under way on BBC Radio 5 Live. BBC Sounds and also on the World Service. Tottenham are in there, Chains Strip, the All-Lilac. And here are the two teams. Alisson in goal for Liverpool, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Canati and Robertson. The two changes from the team that played against Leicester are the two fullbacks. Alexander-Arnold, who's on the ball now, coming in for Bradley. Robertson replaces Simicast. The midfield of McAllister, Gravenberg and Savoslai. And a front three of Salah Diaz and Cody Gatpo. Eight changes that Tottenham-Hotspur have made, as Madison will carry the ball forward on that far side. It looks for Tel, making the run ahead of him, and it will go out of play for a goal kick. Vicario is in goal. Svens, Davies, Danso and Udogi. Great, Bergbal, Madison, Johnson, Solanke and Tel. So only Tel, Svens and Vicario are the three Tottenham players who retain their place in the starting line-up after that defeat against Nodigand Forrest. Liverpool already on the front foot, McAllister, with a pasty ball out towards this left-hand side. The noise is deafening inside Anfield. Don't forget, though, as Steve said, that choice of listening. The second FA Cup semi-final is on sports extra Nodigand Forrest against Manchester City, which is under way at Wembley. We're on air until 7 o'clock tonight, as Danso gets very, very tight towards Dias and gives away a direct free-kick 30 yards out from goal. Really good play there by Dias. And he's not the tallest, you know, you think of him as most of a winger, but when he's playing centre, he's very, very strong. He's got low centre of gravity, really hard to get round him, and he wins a free-kick just outside shooting range. But then again, Trent Alexander-Arnold's on the pitch. Well, it was his goal at Leicester coming off the bench. He'd missed the previous four since starting against Paris Saint-Germain. Almost in the middle of March. He's back in the starting line-up. It's actually knocked to the England international, who goes towards Salah, going through someone of a drought, links up with McAllister. Salah shoots! Off his left boot, just over the top, over the crossbar goal kick, 0-0, five-line. And the next stunning way you watch more Salah doing that, gets a ball on the right-hand side. There's a 1-2, and you know he's going to go along that 18-yard line. He does it every time. Can't stop him, though. Just off target, but good start. Goal on the WSL, Elizabeth Conway. It's Leicester-Nil, man-city-1. The goal at 69 minutes came from a brilliant strike from Jess Park, at close range. It's City with all the possession, despite Leicester's heroic defending. It's Leicester-Nil, man-city-1. Earlier Chelsea lost their Champions League semi-final, again by four goals to one, but once a Barcelona went through 8-2 on aggregate, Vicario all in yellow in the sunshine. Patches of blue sky wherever you look above Anfield. It's the type of weather that reeks of winning the title, doesn't it? The sun is shining. End of season. And the fact that they have still got four games left to play... ..it's felt like it's been a question of when, rather than if for some time. But today could well be the day. Indeed, if it stays like this, it will be the day, because they just require a point after Arsenal drop points in midweek. Arna Slott said on Friday that he and the players watched that game all together as the ball goes back against Tottenham-Hotspur. And Liverpool, in their illustrious history, have done it twice before when Tottenham-Hotspur have been the opposition. 1982, the penultimate day of the... ..or game of the season, they won by three goals to one. And in 1988, with four games to spare, they beat Tottenham by a goal to nil here at Anfield. The great Peter Beersley, part of that superb Liverpool side with the only goal as Liverpool celebrated title success in the 80s against Spurs. As here, Spurs are attacking and Madison to the edge of the area with his back to goal, back to Archie Gray. Cross worked over from the left. Brennan Johnson was almost ready to pounce Liverpool, get the ball away and then lose the ball, but in fact, it wouldn't have counted offside. There's been a goal at Wembley, commentary on Sports Extra. John Southall, who's got it? What a start from Manchester City, Nottingham, Forrest Nill, Manchester City 1, Rico Lewis inside the D. Really good finish into the bottom left-hand corner. Forrest Nill, Manchester City 1. John Murray and Clinton Morrison providing commentary on Sports Extra. This is exclusive radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and the World Service, also available on the BBC Sounds app from inside Anfield on this sunny day, where we've been playing for nearly five minutes and it is nil-nil. What have you made of the start, Pat? Liverpool have been the better stronger team. They've been in the ball much more often, so their position starts to build. But Tottenham are not being passive. They're not a team that's not walked out here, expecting just to be patsies on the day. They're like the way they've started this game. It's like an ang post-acord, they're putting in the effort, they're closing down, they're trying to get forward in decent numbers when they actually do get the ball. So actually, decent stuff so far. Well, here is Tel, which is 20th birthday today. He loses the ball, Gravenberg now picks it up and runs forward. He's got Gatpo going ahead of him. He looks for a ball through the middle. It was cut out by a sliding Davis. DS now, back with Liverpool. All in red, playing from right to left as we look, attacking the Anfield road end. DS, his ball takes the deflection loops in the air and wasn't necessarily dealt with at the first time of asking by Odogi and helped out by Tel, they clear it downfield. It's just Liverpool, when they are on the ball, it's much more controlled, isn't it? They know what they're doing. They believe in themselves to get it in close. Approximately, you know, to other blue shots that are getting close, they're a little bit more stretched. If you're a Tottenham player, maybe not so many options ahead of you. But that's always the case when you come to Anfield. But this shows you that Liverpool started off the way they wanted to. The way the manager wanted them to and the way the fans wanted them to. Bicarreo, the Tottenham goalkeeper, has the ball at his feet, all in yellow away towards our left as the firework is let off somewhere outside Anfield. The scene certainly on the team bus made its way to the ground. Looked like absolute mayhem. The supporters lining the streets in their thousands. The red smoke flares were let off. You hardly see the team bus at one point. His tail looks for Solanke, cut out. Then Gravenberg tries to release Salah with an early ball out of defence. Salah makes a run out towards the left-hand side. And then his arcing ball into the penalty area. Goes too far ahead of Dias, who was making a long-bursting run through the middle to try and keep up with him. And then Subotlai goes to charge down the clearance from Archie Gray. Every challenge is being cheered by this fervent Liverpool support. But the break was brilliant from Liverpool. Such a typical run there from most of them. Knows well the spaces. Looking all the time, he's running away from the goal. He knew the only ball that could get Dias in was the one between the centre-back and the goalkeeper. But otherwise Dias cut himself out from it. Nothing wrong with the ball from Salah. Everything right, it's just Dias' stop-runner. Robertson tied his up. Back it goes to Alisson. Solanke from the Liverpool player, closes him down. Out to Khadate, along the ground. Subotlai lays it off. Gravenberg comes onto it. Over the halfway line. And then Gravenberg in field towards McAllister. Bergwald has scored his first goal for Tottenham against Liverpool in the League Cup semi-final, first leg in North London. Makes the challenge. Liverpool though back with Dias. Gatko on the left-hand side. Robertson, Van Dijk forward, reaches Gravenberg. And then the move breaks down as McAllister's pass goes to Strayer and Ben Davies, the Welsh international, towards Vicario. But talks a lot about Liverpool, but Postercock, who was saying that he wants his team to come here and to compete, wants his team to try and be competitive, sends his team out with that instruction every time. I know it hasn't happened for what has been an extremely disappointing League campaign, and yet it could result in Tottenham getting their first trophy since 2008, as the ball from Van Dijk to Gatko. And Gatko did very well to get it goalwards on the half-bully, all quick to control, right-footed, and Vicario is touched it behind for a corner at his near post. Corner kick to Liverpool, 0-0. No, the assessment referees in the right position. Now Gatko gets it right on the left-hand side there. There's not much on there, but he gets it towards the target. And Tibana's not sure that can physically be a corner kick. It was either gone out already, but there's no way that he carried it out. No chance at all there. Liverpool have got a bit lucky to get a corner kick here. Tom Bramble is the referee here this afternoon, so in front of the Anfield road end, there's loyal Tottenham fans who've made the journey up. That's where the corner kick is going to come from on this near side. He goes into a crowded area, Vicario comes out, it gets something on it, so Voslai down into the ground. Oh, the overhead kick from Gatko would have been absolutely exquisite. He teeded up a couple of times. His right footed up, it was just off target. That would have been spectacular. You know, before he had Tida up, you think there's only one thing you can do here, but you've got to get everything right. And he did. The first touch stops it, then he flexes it up, and then he swivels his body, catches it on the volley. There is not a hope in the world that Vicario would have said that had it been on target, but it's just bent away. He's actually got nine games without a goal. His last water against Tottenham in the league semi-final for Kodi Gatko. 16 goals he scored for Liverpool. But it's been a positive start, hasn't it? Yeah, they've started well. Gatko's holding the ball up really well there. Really impressed the way Gravenberg and McAllister, one of them goes, one of them stays. Sometimes they seem to understand each other. It wins the time when it's safe to go and go into dangerous positions, so really difficult duo to play against, and that's before you even consider Shoboslai, who's in their try-create space. They've looked really good so far, however, corner kick against Liverpool. Yes, Tottenham hot-spoor on this near side, the right, attacking the cop end. Ten and a half minutes played, Mill-Nil, Madison. One of those eight changes, strolls across, and the shadows of the cop to take it. Salanki winning that corner in a duel with Canate. He's in no hurry to place the ball down, and the very fringes of the quadrants on this near side, the right, Spurs playing from left to right as we look. Liverpool have every red shirt back inside the penalty area. It's going to be an out-swinger from Madison. Left arm goes a lot, right-footed corner kick comes in now, and the header is in, and Dominic Salanki, a former Liverpool player on his return here at Anfield, gives Spurs the lead. That wasn't in the script. Liverpool, Mill, Tottenham hot-spoor on. Well, may not be in the script, but it was made this very, very interesting indeed. But hardly been off the pitch so far. As I say, they've not been playing badly, Spurs, but Liverpool control most of the possession, but they get that corner, kiss, and it's a very, very clean hit. He's on his own really at the back post. He should never really happen at a corner kick, but he just uses his physicality, gets between two players there, and he powers it. Down low, into the corner. Absolutely nothing else he can do. Game on. Only scored one goal, and he's 27 appearances. Four Liverpool in that 18-month spell that was ravaged by injury. But I take you back to 1990, the last time that Liverpool won the title in front of their supporters some 35 years ago. It was against London opposition that day. And it was slightly earlier, this goal from Solanki, but Roy Wegerly, after 14 minutes, gave Queen's Park Rangers the lead before Ian Rush and that John Barnes penalty in the second half secured the title. But Spurs... A 1-0 up. And the point that Liverpool require. Yeah, it's not there, no. Absolutely right. It's not there just yet. I mean, we did measure it beforehand. It's not an absolute foregrip conclusion. It's late in the hood that Liverpool would win today, but this makes up much more interesting game, actually, because the control they expect to put together, the way they're fans behind them, they may have a chance now. And Davis has given the ball away. Salah with a cross just over the head of a tumbling Lewis Dias. Spence now, will Claire for Spurs. And Solanki, who's full of running, I've got to say, will pursue that ball and Van Dyke tidies it up back towards Allyson. Liverpool this season have failed to score just four times in 51 games in this campaign, Nottingham, Forrest Spurs, Plenif and Paris Saint-Germain. What you don't want to do after your Spurs is now to set back and try and take off as much of the pressure that's going to get put on you. You do that here. You do that against Liverpool generally. It's not going to work. You do that here at Anfield, when the fans are in this kind of supporting mood. It doesn't seem the most sensible thing to do. So, I said they weren't passive before, and Spurs have not been passive. You have to make sure they can keep that up. Ball out of the top from defense from Conate. McAllister runs onto it, edge of the area. He finds Lewis Dias. Dias turns onto his left foot, back onto his right. Still can't find a shooting opportunity. Tries to chip the ball to Salah. Takes the deflection. Tell comes back to help out and clears the ball away. So, in the FA Cup, Manchester City leading, nottingham forest by a goal to nil. That's on Sports Extra. Here at Anfield on five live, the World Service and Vigisly sounds. Tottenham-Hotspur are 1-0 up. Tottenham have only had one win in their last 14 league meetings against Liverpool. That was actually in North London in September 23. Jones and Jotter were sent off. Their record, actually at Anfield, isn't great. Spurs have lost their last three visits to Anfield and haven't won in 15 games since 2011. Vandervaarten-Modrich were on target that particular day. 15 minutes played, update in the rugby league. Matt Newsom. Yeah, Wigan have a big buffer now. 32 points to 12, they lead here. Bevin French with a counterattack. Hall were on the Wigan line. Bevin French turned that with a flash and it's 32 points to 12. 15 minutes played here at Anfield. Pat Nevis. And if you're a Liverpool fan, you're listening in here. It's not going to harm whispers, they're not going to set back and suck up because the manager's called and is post-acoglu. So they're playing a really high line again, who sees exactly what Liverpool are, some of the players like to play against. Cackpoh's ball in, stabbed away, up into the air by Davis. Spence heads it away. McAllister runs away from Solanke. Back with Van Dijk, left of the centre circle. Canate, every outfield player is in the half away towards our left. Here is Canate now coming forward. They've got two options and he takes the advanced option of Salah, who now slides the ball through to Sabaswai. Square is it! Flaid goes up. Flaid's raised on the far side. The celebrations are cut short. Naturally, BER will have a look. Liverpool thought they'd equalised. Yeah, but it is very close. So through, Ball, I thought was fine. I don't know if that's the one that's going to get called. I think it may well be that they actually passed into the middle of the suggestion that was offside. So we wasn't here in the monitor. The first ball I thought was a beautiful through ball. I thought that was onside. I'm looking at it again here and it looks onside to me. It's very, very close. I wouldn't be surprised if this goal stands. Sabaswai looked onside. Certainly Lewis Diaz was coming from a position where he wasn't offside. I like you, Pat. I think this little goal will stand. To be honest, it's very, very close and it's all about that first pass. The assistant referee's put it up. Do you know what? It's right to put it up because you're not sure. Let's have a check. He's never checked it anyway. But my first thought was it was beautifully timed. The pass and the run. This is millimetres. You'll tell by the noise. You will hear the roar when the referee gives his decision. VAR having a look. Semi-automated. I only had one look at it on the monitor. To the naked eye, he looked onside. But I wasn't just, you know, by a shot. The width of a shot. No more than that. But it looked okay. There it is. The goal stands and Lewis Diaz runs away to celebrate an incident. Every Liverpool supporter is on their feet. The shirt scarves, flags. If it's red and white, it's flying in the air. And Lewis Diaz has levelled. And we're back all squared. And Liverpool have the point that they so badly crave. One-one. Unless on the line, it was a brilliant go-in. Classically from that right-hand side, that's what Liverpool do. The tear-teams apart, there's a slightly higher line than you absolutely necessarily have. And there's that slip bow through. And when you get towards a bi-lane, you just know. And it's only the width of a shoulder. It's nothing more than that. But it's a brilliant ball, as usual. The timing the slip bow through by Salah was phenomenal. So, honestly, he's actually done a huge amount so far. But I mentioned before, all he's doing is looking for space. Wow, he found his space there, didn't he? One-one, beautiful goal. Classic, typical Liverpool goal. And the party only went flat for all of four minutes. But you know, it's torn them, you know. The dev goes away, they create chances. You will make chances against them. So, you know, one-one. Let's hope it keeps them being as exciting for the rest of the game. You know, in a main stand, normally that's where the supporters are slightly more reserved. Bergbauer with a cut back on the right-hand side. Not now, as Lewis Diaz's chant reverberates around out. Even in the bottom tier, as a look down, they were dancing in the stands down below. Liverpool won, Tottenham Hotspur won. The tails are up now for Liverpool. Salah holds off the challenge of Udagi and is able to turn. And then waits and then holds onto it and passes the ball back. And here is Van Dijk. Canate right in the centre circle. Fiennes-McAllister. And then the ball goes away. Van Dijk's right-to-the-centre circle. Fiennes-McAllister. So, Bostley helps it out now towards Salah. They are working their way into Tottenham territory. One-one on five lives. Salah on the right. His cross into the penalty area. Headed away by Spence. Solanke. His header is misdirected. Falls to Gravenberg, runs forward. Salah able to turn onto his left boot. Back to Gravenberg! The plug-a-game is raised on the far side. This one might be offside. But again, VAR will have the final say. Stick on offside, that one. Well offside. But it's the same position again. Going down the right-hand side, they are absolutely shredding spells down that right-hand side. I mean, it was not only Wins offside, it was Trace offside that moved, so I don't think there's any doubt about that one at all. But on the right-hand side, they've seen that as a slight weakness there. But it's not getting forward. Every time Salah gets the ball, he looks dangerous. But every player on that right-hand side wants to slip in the ball in because you have third-man runners all the time. By the way, can we go back to the goal for a second? Salah will not get an assist for that goal, which is a crime against football, because it was all the intelligence of Salah and his movement that made that first goal for Liverpool. That goal was disallowed with that underway. And that was the first goal, one Tottenham-Holzberg one, such as the noise inside Anfield. There was an instruction from the studio. Absolutely could not hear it for a minute. But thank you for repeating it. It's an update from Wembley, John Southall. It's Forrest Niel, Man City one. City have been so dominant in these only 20 minutes. Rico Lewis with a goal inside, two minutes. Monmousha has just hit one over the crossbar. Forrest just simply cannot get hold of the ball, and that's what's been happening to him. He's been a real man city one. The red smoke bomb has been let off in the Liverpool end in the Anfield road, and away towards our left. So there's a slight misty red haze, which is drifting towards the blue skies on the Ersy side, as the sun continues to shine. Liverpool one, Tottenham-Holzberg one, we're approaching the midway point in the first half. Pat Ledin. You just watched, but after a sports fan, that was a good turn there, sports fans today. There was a lot of them after a left-hand side. Why are we so high against teams that love to run from deep? And we don't close midfielders down, especially someone like Salah. And he's got so many options. You know Gravenberg will come from deep. You know MacArthur will. Shabazzlite is fantastic at it. Gackposed doing it as well. And by the way, the two fullbacks are going to run from deep as well. Every time they get the ball on midfield, your heart must be in your mouth if you're a sports fan today. That's the familiar voice of Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 Live, who was with us here this afternoon as Canate with a back pass to Allyson. Able to control it inside the deep, forward ball. Alexander-Arnold comes into a central area and then right footed, hits it and it drifts out of play for a Tottenham throw over on that far side that Old Doggy will take for Spurs. One more. Just calmed down a little bit. I mean, it was me. Never in the five or ten minutes. Liverpool scoring, getting ball in the net again after having lost the goal. So lots of excitement. Maybe it needs a few moments just to calm down a little bit. The players at Liverpool, I just don't think they're late now. I think they want to keep it going at a high tempo. Robertson's header went astray. Spurs have it with Davis, leaves it for Kevin Danso, who is on loan from Longs with an obligation to buy a £21m deal has been lined up in the summer. That'll be a five-year contract as Vicario, the goalkeeper for Spurs, just gives it short and square. Davis, Madison comes over to play the ball forward. He looked for Tel on the left-hand side, cut out by Alexander-Arnold, infield to Diaz, strokes it out now towards Gravenberg, forward to Salah. Right-hand side leveled the area to Gravenberg, gives the ball back towards Salah. Salah tried to return the favour, Gravenberg wasn't on the same wavelength. Madison was there, Tel is back helping out. They're in the first, they were deep, and they've lost the ball. Gravenberg helps it run towards McAllister! Oh, what a goal! Lift-butting rocket into the short right-hand corner. That's the goals again, the party started. Liverpool have come from behind, they lead Spurs by two goals to one. Well, if you're a Liverpool fan, manager, player, but certainly McAllister, you went back, you went to bed last night and thought, wonder if I could score a 20-yarder right in the top corner to put his head. He's just done that there, brilliant. The way the ball was won back, when they had no right to win it back, Spurs tried to play it out to the back, but he didn't have the power and the physicality to hold onto the ball. One back and McAllister all in, one thing in his mind, took two or three little touches across that 18-yard line there after. That's high pressing, it's all a bit high pressing, getting the ball back again. McAllister, it's actually two touches and he lashes it into the top net for him a bit 20 yards, what a goal! Two-one, torture for Spurs fans, but you're not short, are you? He's matched his tally from last season. Seven goals last, seven for this, and he's had some sweet strikes since he arrived from Brighton, Hobalbian. And now the chant is, we're going to win the league. The only needed appoints, Liverpool are on course for all three. This is the atmosphere inside Anfield on BBC Radio. CHEERING From Tottenham Hotspur's point of view, because I know Ant Posthakoglu is looking for a result to try and give them some sort of impetus to take into that game against Boadow-Glimps on Thursday. What they don't want now is to suffer a heavy defeat. Yeah, and the thing about Liverpool, they weren't going through his control today, they wanted this to be a joy. We were talking about it before the game. What do you want if you're Liverpool? You want to win on a sunny day, you want to score lots of goals, you want to win it with style. Now, the two-one, there's been plenty of style about it so far, but they will not stop here. You will keep going. Just one other thing about that goal there from Liverpool. They're winning the ball back by Gravenberg, and then giving it to his mate, Macastor. Those two have been a phenomenal duo in this campaign. Very, very fitting, they should be involved in that. Very important goal. Full-time in the WSL, Elizabeth Conway. It's Leicester Neal, Man City won. A well-deserved win for a dominant Man City. The goal came in the second half with a superb strike from Jess Park. City fans will be thrilled to see Lauren Hent back on the pitch after five months off with injury. It finishes Leicester Neal, Man City won. It's also finished in League One at St Andrews, Birmingham City, four. Mansfield Town, Nill, earlier, Stevenage won, Rotherham won. It was the scoreline in that division. Not even for us, Nill. Manchester City won in the FA Cup semi-final. Remains the latest at Wembley. Commentary of that is currently on Sports Extra. And during the week as well, we've got Tuesday night. Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain, live from the Emirates. And on Thursday, we're live in Bilbao. Athletic Bilbao against Manchester United, but we will have news of Spurs and Chelsea too in their semi-finals of European competition. Tottenham, Hotspur, over on that far side the left. 27 minutes played in the sunshine here at Anfield. Have a free kick in front of the Sekenidow-Gliesch stand. And it's Madison, who wraps his foot around it. And Solanki's looping header is tipped over by Alisson. Corner kick to Spurs, two on Liverpool. Yeah, for the fact that Liverpool have been very good. They've managed to go ahead after that one difficult moment with Solanki scored. You wouldn't be absolutely shocked if they scored again, Spurs. Because they do look quite dangerous when they're going forward. Obviously, particularly from set pieces. I mean, Alisson had to do and tipped that one over the bar. It was probably going over anyway, but he knew it. However, we know Spurs scored on from exactly the same possession, which they scored already. And it's on this near side the right, attacking the cop end, playing in the change-outfit. Sky blue or a hint of lilac, hard to tell from our position so far away. Here in our comical position at Anfield, right at the halfway line. But Madison is going to take it, nevertheless, on the right-hand side. And the left arm goes a lot. Tel makes himself available, he's not utilised. And it goes to that area. Canate this time, stood firm, headed it away. Danzo was trying to get on the end of it. Ball is hit by Spence, he goes behind Madison. Will he keep the ball in play? Yes, he will, down by the corner flag. And then Alexander-Arnold wanders across to the left-back area and puts it out of play for a Tottenham throw. Trent looks a wee bit uncomfortable there in that left-back position. Ball went over his head, but he didn't find it, he kept it calm. He made sure Madison couldn't get across there. Did its light blue, just had that confirmed. As Spence sends over the cross from the right, headed forward by Dave. He bounces off the chest of Gravenberg. The boss like, his ball took a deflection. And wow, Alexander-Arnold to volley it away downfield. Spurs tied it back up towards Vicario. Chips the ball out, red though by Gakpo, his header in field. Bergvall can't get there. Diaz was too quick for him, in field to Savoslij, caught by Madison. And Madison gives away a free kick. Savoslij stays down. Let's get an update from Wembley-John Southall. Forrest Nill, man's City 1. Chance for City, Niko Arale did brilliantly 30 yards out, evaded two, three challenges. His 25-yard-wide with the right hand post. Forrest Nill, City 1. Conventary on sports extra. Madison's furious about that free kick being given against him. Again, it's about 32, 33 yards out. And he feels as if he could get the ball. We've seen it in some motion there again. He did get a lot of the ball, but the referee says, we've come in to the back, got a better player. He's given a free kick, and he's within his rates to do that. Well, it is fractionally left of centre. It's 30 yards out. And it's in that area of the field where half of Anfield is in the shadows of the main stand, the other half is bathing in sunshine. And it's just in that little bit of a shadow where you've got Alexander-Arnold, Suboslye and McAllister as a trio deep in discussion. McAllister now walks away and informs part of a two-man wall in front of the three-man Spurswall. It's teed up to Alexander-Arnold who rifles it right-footed over the crossbar goal kick Liverpool lead 2-1. Well, the thing that's going on the line about that as well, is getting it on target straight into the goalkeeper's eyes with the sun right there. You know, just get it on target. That's that question. Keepers hate it when you do that ball on target. Doesn't need to be that fast there. About Ireland, but it was smashed over the top. Solanke might have had a little ludge in the back by Van Dijk, but the referee didn't seem that that was unfair. He lets play continue. Ball played forward by Gravenberg, gets it back. I mentioned our European coverage on 5-LIVE during the week. This today actually is a run of three successive matches for Liverpool against opponents who are in European semi-finals. They travel to Chelsea away next Sunday, and then they're at home to Arsenal on the 11th of May. McAllister, Bergbal closes him down with a help of Van Dijk. They see it back to Allyson. 14 minutes to go to halftime. Liverpool 2-1 up. Lovely we're in a really high position here. We're able to see the system, stroke systems, that Liverpool play. They've got centre-forward up there, it's the last DS, but they've got so many others who come from deep. We'll finish that in a minute. Salah, chases after it and just got away from it. Oh, he gets a corner. Slightly surprised by that. I was just saying that if you're a centre-back in New York, who's my man in marking? Well, in one minute you actually think, oh, it's obviously a DS. Then Sabozla will be the centre-forward, and then it's Gravenberg. And it's honestly, you have no idea at any point in time, doing a build-up and play, who that man will be. They rotate it so well with those positions from the midfield forward. It's horrendous, you just have to take your eye off that. Anyone of those players for one minute, and everybody in that midfield could thread a ball through to him. They are a delight to watch, tactically. They've just been blinded by someone in that corner where McAllister waits to take the corner kick, has got two inflatable balloons in the number 20. And because the silver, they're glinting off the sunshine, as McAllister got a standing ovation, Redmond is to take that corner kick over on that far side. Liverpool lead by two goals to one. There's still those balloons are being lifted in the air. They've had beach balls being banded around ahead of kickoff. Red and white balloons. Certainly that fellow who had the replica Premier League trophy, if Steve Crossman said he was charging ten pounds of photo, when I walked past him, he was charging a fiver. He must have made a real mint today. You've seen him coming. McAllister still waits to take it. The referee... It's weird, the ball keeps rolling off. You know, I didn't think it was that. We were quite high up, so it doesn't look that windy down there, and it shouldn't be with that huge stadium, but the ball keeps rolling off the spot. He waits, and then with a third time of asking, and in it comes now from that right-hand side, Bergmaus header. Might fall here to Gakpo. Gakpo gets the shot away! Gakpo touches it in. There's no shot in Liverpool now. Cody Gakpo. His last goal was against Spurs. It's his first in ten, and it's against Carmel Hotspur. Liverpool now lead by three goals to one. And they are on course for the Premier League title. You know, Twinkle toes. It gets the ball down there. It really ought not to get shot away there. If you're defending well there, you should actually be able to close them down, but he's got such quick feet there. He knows what he wants to do all the way through that move, so when it gets to him, he just goes to his right, away from the goal, knowing that he wants to switch it back to that far corner, and he does it brilliantly. But if you're an Angposted Cogway, if you're a Spurs fan, or a Spurs defender, you're thinking, someone's got to make a tackle there. And he just dances through two challenges and just pings it into the corner. Three you won, and I think Liverpool fans can relax a wee bit now. I know who you were referring to earlier when you spoke about the gentleman who was a little bit apprehensive, shouldn't we say? Yes. I know him well. I would imagine... ...that he can relax. He can relax. Yeah. Honestly, he was worried about it, and actually it's a man we experienced, but it seemed nothing for granted. In a second, maybe, it seemed nothing for granted in football. But these fans here have now, basically, a professional starter department. And Kody Gatpo took the shirt off with his goal celebrations and was booked as a result. So Kody Gatpo shown a yellow card. I don't think that he will mind too much about that. Bergbauer the cross, stopped by Virgil van Dijk. Tottenham took the lead. Liverpool, though, have responded with three goals, and we still have ten minutes to go to halftime, and they're full of running. Salah, he'll want to get on the score sheet. They lose the ball, Tell looks towards Madison, and he's stopped by Canate. And then Canate, linking up with Lewis Diaz. He looks over his shoulder, shrugs off the challenge of Tell, and finds Alexander-Arnold ahead of him on that right-hand side. And then Canate, filling in as a right back, gets it back from Salah. They're in full control. They are, and, you know, I was talking at the start of the game about the improvements you're getting for the likes of Gatpo, becoming better and better, suppose like growing into all the rest of them. Has there any player improved more in terms of quality than Canate? He has become, and, hey, I stole a lot, but much, much more comfortable in the ball. Reading the game generally much better. Hey, every defender will make mistakes, but every time he's on the ball now, he gets such a reaction from this crowd here. Much loved. Full-time in the Super League, Matt Newsom. Yeah, Wigan looking ominous. 36-12, they've beaten Ho here. They climb up to second. Bevin French was the star. He had his hand up pretty much in fingertips, pretty much on everything. Foul FC lived with Wigan in the first half, scoring their 12 points. Will Price looking good, but in the end, it's Wigan looking back to their best. Foul FC-12, Wigan 36. When Pat says that the party has started, it seems that every Liverpool supporter inside Anfield is swirling their red and white scarf over their heads as they celebrate. They're leading by three goals to one. They're under way in the Women's Champions League semi-final, and they're leading by Leon against Arsenal. Victoria Polly. And Arsenal have a 2-1 deficit to overturn from the first leg. They've come back in both of their previous knockout ties this season so far, but Leon are record eight-times champions of this competition. Daphne Van Gomsela returns from injury in goal for Arsenal, while Chloe Kelly is favoured for Beth Mead. And much talked about Leon's star defender, Wendy Reinhardt. He's back in the side, and Arsenal have just taken the lead. They've got it back to T2. They've got that goal. That'll make it interesting. Barcelona earlier beat Chelsea's women by four goals to one, so they went through eight-two on aggregate. So we'll keep you in touch with that. This is five-lie. We're also live on the World Service and BBC Sounds. And Liverpool leading three-one. This fixture has produced more goals than any other in Liverpool's Premier League history, and we've currently had 204 now that have been scored between Tottenham and Liverpool. And they met just before Christmas. It was 6-3 in North London. We could have a few more yet to add to the tally that we've got already. You could, I mean, obviously, Liverpool are looking great favourites at the moment, but it's three-one, if Spurs could get a goal back, although they've not had that many opportunities to go up the field. If he could get one before half-time, but it doesn't look like... Oh! Almost broke away against Liverpool. Required Ben Davies to come across and to curb the run of Dias, but the referee has brought play back. Referee Thomas Bravel, Liverpool have got a free kick. It's a deafening noise inside Anfield. Robertson on the halfway line back towards Van Dijk. They're looking to make up for the title that they couldn't celebrate five years ago. Not with the team, at least anyway. Difficult times during that Covid period and the social distancing as Liverpool get it up now towards Gatpo. Robertson's bobbing on with him on the left-hand side as Gatpo now makes a running feel, uses Robertson's run. Robertson's cross, Salah's header, here is the boss line. Teesam Alexander-Arnold down into the ground, Davies with a header away. Liverpool are riding on the crest of a wave and the energy inside Anfield Stadium. Yeah, that move was sumptuous. It was an absolute joy to watch. I mean, you knew it, every single pass it was going to be made, two or three seconds before it was made, but it didn't matter, I suppose couldn't do it in about it. That move deserved a goal from the left-hand side down. Ended up a short and target, no goal, but they are playing some lovely football just now, Liverpool. So we've got about five minutes to go to halftime here on five live. Not even Forrest Manchester City was also a 430 kickoff. John Southall. Played 38 minutes here, not even Forrest Neal, Manchester City won, City in total control at the moment, one chance for Forrest. The flag was up though, Chris Wood, good chance, one of the right-hand post, Forrest Neal, Man City won. Well, Arna Slopp, when he spoke to the media ahead of this game, he was asked, will you enjoy it? And he said, I'll only enjoy it once the final whistle has sounded. You might remember European clock with that chance of Arna Slopp, that is the chance that is currently being sung by the Liverpool supporters inside Anfield. He will be the third Liverpool manager to win the league title in his first full season, as Tel to the edge of the area is held up by Alexander Arnall. Madison, still with Spurs on that far side, Spurs with a cross coming in, tucked in with Robertson to head it away. Joe Fagan, 84, Sir Kenneth Alglish, 86. Arna Slopp is an extremely good company. It is a phenomenal thing to do in your first season. I'd love to underline just now. I did not see this coming at the start of the season. I tell a lot of people who say now, oh yeah, they were definitely going to go and push you on. Come on, losing your green clock. He just didn't feel it could go that this well. So that adds to the fact that the expectation was a wee bit more limited than others had had. Slopp would have been given a lot of that more time, wouldn't he? But he absolutely hasn't needed it. He's been brilliant so far. But I don't think you're alone. I don't think many neutrals would have expected Liverpool to be in this position, not with still four games remaining as well. And in fact, I don't know whether you're one of them, but I don't think there was one BBC pundit on the BBC Sport website that predicted that Liverpool would win the title this year. I realise, I rated Jurgen Klopp and his effect on Liverpool Football Club so highly. I just said, we're lucky to get the top four. It's not an anti-Liverpool. It's just a respect for what Jurgen Klopp had brought to this club. However, I didn't know how good on the slot would be. And also the fact that it's more than that, there's something else, something bigger, which we'll deal with after the game, which is bringing in the right players over a period of time and them growing into it. And that's when you talk about the Shippo's lies and the McAllisters and Gackpoes, etc. They're just getting better and better and better all the time. Well, if you recall the conversation that he had with Gary Lineker earlier in the season, you can go back and find it on the BBC Sounds app. He was talking a lot about the work that he inherited from Jurgen Klopp and the culture within the training ground that he'd also inherited. As Johnson comes forward for Spurs, in towards Solanke, Tel-Ariving, Canate had to make the challenge. Now, did Canate get a nibble of Tel, who's gone down? VAR will have a look at it. Must have a look at that. I mean, if it doesn't get any of the ball, that's apparently kicking out. That's apparently kicking out. Absolutely should be apparently kicking out if it doesn't get any of the ball. Referee's slowing it down. He sees an injury on the pitch here. So he's giving the serve a little bit of breathing space here, the referee, hasn't he? Stopped the game, injury in the far side there. There's no acting going on there. That was an injury. But was it Canate? I think it was Canate. Yes, it was. Did he get any of the ball? He's also down as well, Pat Canate. So, has he ever gotten any of the ball? And if there was contact, who initiates the contact? Do you know what? It doesn't look great for Canate. We've got the right angle here. Let's have a look at it. Canate goes for it, gets a bit of the ball first. I think he's okay. I think he's going to say he gets away with it. But he doesn't get a lot of the ball clean. He catches it with his shin. Yeah, that's probably enough. As the cross comes in from the right-hand side from Johnson, Canate is attacking it with Tel coming in from behind him. And Canate goes to ground and is trying to sweep the ball away. And probably does just get enough before catching his tail. I would say, confidently normally, that's not a penalty kick. There are so many times in a season where I've thought something's confidently, something the referee's disagreed, but no chance that should be a penalty kick. Tel is back on his feet. Canate is hobbling. Good move though, wasn't it? It was a great move. And we're in the best moments that Spurs have had in this period. And just before halftime, had they managed to get it back to 3-2? Yeah, they've changed the atmosphere. Well, one more little. But also, I mean, not only did they take the lead, but Szilanki has also had a looping header tipped over by Alisson. I think Alisson was in control of that. That, on this occasion, I don't think Liverpool were completely in control of the situation. Robertson forward for Liverpool. His low cross into the penalty area. Archie Gray couldn't get there. And then coming out with the ball was Udagi to Spence under pressure because of Liverpool pressing. And Robertson almost got there. Now Udagi has actually stayed forward on this near side the right. And McAllister comes across and stops him in his tracks with a committed sliding challenge out for a throw. Liverpool lead 3-1. He's having one of those M-days, isn't he? McAllister, he's absolutely having one of those days. Every tackle has been nailed. He's timed it brilliantly. He's got an absolute world day as well. He is flying out there in the middle of that part. I mean, he's had a lot of great games this season, but... And then he's right up there for a possible man-to-match. This early on. Spence to Johnson on the stretch was Gray. Triangle of passing movements from the Tottenham players on this near side the right in front of the main stand. And Gray passes the ball back towards Dancer, who will come forward. He instructs somebody to go into the midfield ahead of him. In the end, he goes back towards Ben Davis, out towards Madison, Udagi is gone in field, so he passes the ball towards Tell, who runs forward on that left towards the byline and sends over across. And it's stopped there by Allison, as we are into four minutes of added-on time here at Anfield. Liverpool fell behind, but they're on course for a record each week. 20th title as they now lead 3-1. She's not to forget that the last couple of minutes first have looked a little bit dangerous. They've got down the right-hand side and the left-hand side, got crosses from the byline. So, you know, they've not given up on this at all yet. The problem that they've got is a number of problems. When they'll measure two goals behind, number two problem, which is a quite big problem. You're playing in the Cop if you're Liverpool in the second half, and they quite enjoy that. So, there's the proverbial mountain to claim first post, but they'll try. And not only that, Pat, but Liverpool have scored more goals in the second half this season than any other side. They've scored 42 of their 75 goals after half-time. Rather ominous statistic, one would suggest, as Gakpo's curling ball is caught by Vicario, in the sunshine, and then he rolls it out underarm towards Udagi over on that far side. Earlier in the Premier League, Bournemouth won Manchester United won. Manchester United, like Spurs, will focus on that Europa League. Semi-final on Thursday night will be live in Bilbao. 48 hours before that will be live in North London for Arsenal against Paris Saint-Germain, which should be a mouth-watering contest in the Champions League. But this is the Premier League. We're in first half stoppage time, 3-1 Liverpool. Just as you were chatting there, McAllister's made a tackle on the back of Comus on Madison there. And it's one of those ones where he goes in, and if he doesn't get the ball, the player's going to be... He's going to feel it. He's going to remember it. It's not costing me a little bit there, but it's one of those ones that a defensive midfielder loves to put in there, to put, as they say, a marker on the game. Well, Madison stands alone over the free kick. Liverpool have got a line of red on the edge of the penalty area, in front of the cock. Ball goes out to a doggie, plays it back inside to Madison. Madison then feeds it to the feet of a doggie who can run into the penalty area with a cutback. This is Tal, gets the shot away, flick away by Van Dyke to clear it. Bergbal runs forward, left-hand side of the area rolls down his chest, runs into trouble with Savoslai, but he shows his strength. Bergbal chips over the cross, no-bid there to miss it. Runs out of play for a goal kick. Liverpool leave 3-1 in stoppage time. Yeah, but it will, Don Sprozz again. It's been a long time and just a few minutes, a got to the byline, got dangerous crosses in. So they haven't given up, they're not folded. I mean, you said after the third goal, you know, you don't want an absolute hamening of your Spurs with this massive game coming up. But it's not looked like that since then, you know, it's not that Liverpool have taken the foot off the gas, it's the fact that Spurs haven't given up, they've kept going. Haven't said that, the 3-1 down. And as we were watching there, Daniel Levy was looking pensive, shall we say. Well, it does look increasingly likely that there will be a parting of the ways coming the end of the season with Ange-Poster Coglut. Two years that he's had in charge and yet he could. It was Wander Ramos, who was the last Tottenham manager to win some silverware back in 2008. Ange-Poster Coglut could yet depart on a high. Indeed, if that does occur in a few weeks' time. The 3-1 down here is Gravenberg, almost overruns it, gets away from Tel, but then is stopped by Udagi, passes the ball inside towards Madison, runs into a cul-de-sac of red shirts and it's cleared away by Trent Alexander-Arnold. You know, that is one area where Liverpool have made that tweak from Arneslott, they have tightened up defensively. In that central defensive midfield area, we are going on there a bit, MacArthur, who was slightly out of position. Gravenberg went in absolutely nailed Madison again there. He thought he'd a lot of space to run into, he wouldn't make sure you do the right things all the way to the whistle and have done just that. The half-time whistle sounds and Liverpool are 45 minutes away. The confirmation of the news that we all know is going to happen, they are going to win the title because they fell behind to a Salanki header that gave Spurs the lead after 12 minutes. It lasted all of four minutes before Dias, after a VAR check, had equalised, they then had a goal disallowed, Macalester with a fine, fine effort, after 24 minutes and then Gakpo added a third some 10 minutes later. So half-time at Anfield, Liverpool three, Tottenham hot-spawn one. And let's go straight to Wembley Stadium where the half-time whistle has gone in the FA Cup semi-final, John Southall. Where Steve is knotting in Forest Nill, Manchester City 1 are really impressive, first half from Man City, they have been so dominant, 76% possession and that does not lie but just the one goal inside the first two minutes, Rico Lurs giving too much time and space in the D and he finished into the bottom left-hand corner. Two struck one over the bar from 30 yards and Nico O'Reilly had a shot wide from a similar distance, Forrest yet to have a shot, big job for their manager, Nuno at half-time, Forrest Nill, Manchester City 1. Thank you very much John, we'll be back with John Murray and Clinton Morrison at Wembley before second half commentary here at Anfield. Remember five sports extra for knotting in Forest Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final, here on Five Live, Liverpool leading Tottenham hot-spawn at half-time. A game remember which they only need to draw to secure the title but they are three-one up having gone one-nil down, didn't we just say Pat Nevin that it isn't always straightforward albeit it's starting to look it now? Yeah, I mean they go the goal down and a question has been asked, that question has been asked a lot of Liverpool this season, they have generally had a very good answer to it which is going to score more goals and they've done it really well, I mean on the right-hand side there was periods of time there and when he fancied it, Salah looked unstoppable there and of course it led to the opening goal which can open the floodgates but I've been so impressed with the work rate, the closing down, it's one of the strange things to say about football, do you see a team of horrible to play against, it's one of the biggest compliments you can get from them, it is a big compliment and you look at MacArthur and you look at Gravenbergen and you think, oh they'd be horrible because they can play, they're not holdable, they're hard, they work hard, they cover constantly, those two have been staggeringly impressive today as a duo. It's quite often you buy players, I mean obviously some boys like Graves, well and Gacpo's helping them there when they need to, but when you get two players who seem to know each other and work off each other and they will understand each other's game as well as not looking after themselves, that shows wisdom and game knowledge and game management. So I'm impressed with lots and lots of things about Liverpool today but them too, they've been pretty special. We're on air until 7 o'clock from here inside Anfield so after the full-time whistle assuming Liverpool go on and do it, we'll have lots of time to break it all down, to pay tribute to all of the key players and the manager and all of that kind of thing. But just for now, I do want to pick up again on McAllister because he can be the feather when he needs to be the feather and he's the anvil when he needs to be the anvil. There's just not that many players that have got that, you know, the entirety of it. I mean I would have to say Declan Rice can do all the things you need to do and he's probably getting certain things that maybe even McAllister hasn't got, you know, the low-pitched ride going forward, maybe a wee bit more dangerous sometimes going that way. But it's to take nothing away from the fact that there's not that many players. A lot of players are very specialist these days. But you almost think, yeah, I'll play you anywhere mate, you'll be fine. It's one of the great things over the years that Liverpool have had that, when they've had great sides, they've had certain players, you know, I was telling Stealthby Ronnie Wheeling before, he could do that sort of stuff all the time. You'd have certain players where it doesn't matter where he play, but when you play him in his right position, he is very, very special and he controls games and he hurts people as soon as back in those days. There are a great number of... I want to mention these names because they were that good, that it's good to be mentioned in their company. McAllister's there, absolutely he's there, not he will be there, he is there now. And today he just underlines it, but if anyone deserved a goal, you know, to be the goal that really turned it today, had to be a cast and it was a cracker. And just come back to what I said before the game, you know, you want to be stylish, you want to be a good game, you want to get a game you win, you want to score goals. And if you... The absolute cherry in the top of it is... And some crackers as well. And you've got that. It's one of those things here inside Anfield where one absolutely spectacular goal, plenty of good goals, one brilliant one from McAllister, it's the kind of moment that you just know somewhere, someday, some Liverpool fan is going to write a song about it. On the way into Anfield, I could hear the Liverpool supporters singing D'Vocari-Gi's song to the tune of Saturday Night by Wigfield. I can't say the second line of that song, but it was about that amazing night here against Barcelona all those years ago. There's a rainbow which is just appearing amidst the water from the sprinklers as it just cascades down onto the turf here at Anfield. Glorious first half for Liverpool, leading 3-1, only needing a point. Remember Chelsea have been knocked out of the Women's Champions League today, they were beaten at Stanford Bridge by Barcelona 4-1 to 8-2 on aggregate. The second semi-final is well underway, Arsenal at Lyon. Last we heard, Arsenal had levelled it up on aggregate, Victoria Polley. They have indeed, it's Lyon, Niel, Arsenal 1-1, Arsenal starting how they meaning to go on scoring in the first five minutes. It was a corner that came in, knocked out by the Lyon defence and ended up going in off the Lyon keeper, Christiane Endler. And it's very much been a tale of the two goalkeepers, because at the other end, Daphne von Damselaar, returning in goal for Arsenal, came to claim a ball, didn't get there, and Lyon almost equalised through captain Wendy Reynard, but she fired over, it's Lyon, Niel, Arsenal 1-1, we're over halfway through the first half, it's 2-2 on aggregate. Oh, we're at some glorious sporting arenas today. Beautiful day inside Anfield, we're at Wembley Stadium, and it doesn't get much better than the crucible either, the World Sneaker Championship, Jamie Broughton's there. No, fantastic venue, Steve, and Ronny O'Sullivan is closing in on a place in the quarter-finals. The seven-time champion leaves China's Peng Jumquat by 12 frames to four after the second session of playing their second round match with 13 the target for victory, O'Sullivan knocked in breaks of 79, 80, 105, 135 and 62 this afternoon. Meanwhile, Luca Bracel is also close to booking his place in the last eight, the 2023 champion finished 12-4 up against Ding Zhengui. Both of those matches will be played to a finish tomorrow night. A reminder, it finished born with one Manchester United won in the Premier League earlier today. Second half commentary from here at Anfield on five live, and from Wembley Stadium on five sports extra for the FA Cup semi-final. Both come after the news with Dan Mordesley. The voice of the UK. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. The Canadian Prime Minister has set a suspect who rammed a car into crowds at a street festival in Vancouver yesterday. He's believed to have acted alone. Nine people were killed and 20 others injured, in what Mark Carney described as a horrific attack, two days before tomorrow's federal election there. Police don't believe it's terrorism related. Mr. Carney said he was heartbroken. And to them and to the many others who were injured, to the Filipino-Canadian community, and to everyone in the broader Lower Mainland, Vancouver, I would like to offer my deepest condolences and my wishes for strength and compassion in this tragic time. I know that I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know that Canadians are united with you. The Green Party has said interim guidance on single-sex spaces should be withdrawn. The advice by the Equalities Watchdog, which follows the Supreme Court ruling, says trans women shouldn't be allowed to use women's facilities. One of the two women seriously injured in a crossbow attack in Otliy, in West Yorkshire yesterday, remains in hospital, while the other has been discharged. Counterterrorism police are investigating after a crossbow and firearm were recovered at the scene. A suspect is in custody. President Zelensky says Ukrainian troops are continuing to fight in Russia's Kursk region after officials in Moscow said they'd been forced out. Ukraine captured parts of Kursk in a surprise offensive last year. The top American diplomat, Marko Rubio, has told US television that the two sides are closer than ever to a ceasefire deal. Here is Shayset Sto! Christ, Christ, baby! And here are all the analysis and reaction on the Top All Daily Podcast. The Champions League. Listen live. Ask your smart speaker to play BBC Radio 5 Live. This is 5 Live Sports with Steve Crossman. Listen on BBC Sound. Well, I think we can more or less safely say that Liverpool's Premier League winning party is less than an hour away. How close are we to knowing who's going to be meeting Crystal Palace, though, in the FA Cup final? John Murray. Well, half-time here at Wembley, it is Nottingham Forest Nill, Manchester City 1. Manchester City scored the early goal, very good finish from Rico Lewis and the D on the edge of the area, low shot past cells into the bottom corner. And that was only in the second minute, and City then proceeded to absolutely dominate the match. Without, I should say, coming close to a second goal, there has only been one attempt on target in the match, the Lewis goal, and Nottingham Forest have offered nothing. They've seen so little of the ball, and when they have had it, they've done nothing with it. Cell Clinton Morrison, something's got to change from Forrest from Noonal. It has to change, and I've been screaming for it, and it looks like he might be coming on a langage. I just look at Man City's high back line, I'm thinking, they don't have enough runners who can go in behind. He's one of the quickest in the Premier League. You needed to change it because you were right. They were powered up off, they didn't, they didn't, I'm getting behind Man City at all. Man City, as you said, dominated possession without actually working cells that much. And Forrest have been neither nothing nor something, have they? Yeah, it's been half-hearted, hasn't it? We're there, but we're not really pressing. We're letting Covetich and Bernardo Silva, who people say legs have gone, dominate. Go move up the field, ten yards further up the field, and go and press Man City, and go and cause them problems. But it couldn't be any more obvious that a langage is coming on for the second half, because he came out to warm up in his match shirt, he's now taken off his tracksuit bottoms, he has ready, he's got it kit on, it's his 23rd birthday today, and he's ready to go. Yeah, and he's been brilliant this season, and he gives, you ask any defender, they don't like playing against Pace, and he's one of the quickest around, so, yeah, Forrest are hoping, and the fans and the players, his teammates, hoping he could get a birthday goal, because it'll be fitting for him, I think he's had an outstanding season for them. Yeah, and my goodness, they do need something, nothing of Forrest, because if it continues as it was in the first half, Manchester City will score a second goal, they'll win this semi-final, and it will be Crystal Palace against Manchester City here in three weekends time. However, at half-time, it is Nottingham Forrest-Nill, Manchester City one, so it's not over yet. John Clinton, thank you both very much indeed, second half commentary on five sports, extra 6-0-6 starts at 7 o'clock tonight, 08-0-8-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, Premier League winner, Chris Sutton, big part of the team of course, afternoon, Chris. Hello, Steve, you're not easy winning a Premier League, Steve. No, Liverpool have made it look like that, haven't they? No, they have, I mean, you know, that's the headline of today's bill, it'll be party time, Tottenham will not come back into this game, we can't see it, and they have made it look pretty routine, Steve, haven't they, this season? They've blown everybody away, Harneslotz first season, and I suppose that the question is, celebrate this season, what's been special about it, but can they carry on under Harneslotz and dominate? Do you think they can? Oh, it's difficult because we expect Manchester City to respond, I mean, I'm on with Roman Kemp tonight, he likes his Arsenal, you know, he's an Arsenal fan, and everybody thought this would be the season for Arsenal, and they've fallen away, but of course they've got the Champions League, haven't they, which will, you know, if they win that all will be forgiven with the Premier League, but the signing of, you know, getting the Salah deal done, and Dyke deal done, they're in a pretty good place, and you know, Liverpool fans must be absolutely delighted with this season, but also looking forward. 08, 08, 05, 9, 0, 9, 6, 9, 3, cheers, Chris, have a good one. Thanks, Steve. Chris Sturton, Roman Kemp, 6'06, 7 o'clock tonight, we're live from inside, and Fieldy and Dennis and Pat Nevin are here, Liverpool substitutes just warming up beneath us, I have to say, Pat, this is, I've seen quite a lot of Liverpool live lately, and this is the best I can remember them, probably since just before the first leg of the PSG Champions League title, and I know they won that first leg, but not at their best. I've not seen this Liverpool for quite a while. You know, every team, I've told recently a lot of fans from a lot of different clubs, and every team will go through a dip, go through a dip and don't lose like many games, that's the trick, you know, you might not be playing that brilliantly, you might lose the odd game or draw the odd game here and there. It just happens, you can't be at it for that amount of games for an entirety of a season, so that's what they've done, but you're right, they are their best, they have the best version of Liverpool right at this second, and I think it's because they know how to do it, they know how to time it. You know, Salah knew when it was time to turn it on, he's turned it on. He knew they started this game, you knew they did it back, you won now, he's turned it on, you know, the very, very best players have got gears, and they went through a few today so far, haven't they? And now that they've got three, one up, they can maybe cruise away, but I just don't think they will. The Liverpool players have just finished their pre-second half warm-up, almost look like they were dancing, they'll be doing that in 45 minutes time by the looks of it, Anfield is absolutely ready for a Premier League winning party, will be on air until 7 o'clock, drinking in every moment with Liverpool supporters. They've still got a job to do, but it's certainly half done. Ian. Certainly is, thank you Steve, and I would imagine that Arnav Slott, such his focus in the build-up to the game, he hasn't been carried away by any of the emotion. He'll be saying to his players, you keep that laser focus for this second half, go and finish the job, because you're halfway there as the match restarts. Tottenham Hotspur have made two changes, Pepe Sarr replaces Archie Gray in the midfield, and Kuleseski comes on for Madison. So Spurs have the caro in goal, a back four of Spence, Davis Danso and Udogi, Kuleseski, Sarr, Bergvall, Tels, Solanke and Johnson. Liverpool, Spurs incidentally, they're light blue, they're playing from right to left as we look now, so they're defending the cop end, they're attacking the Anfield road end, whereas Liverpool all in red, Allison in goal, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dyke, Kanate Robertson, McAllister, Gravenberg, Serbos Lai, and then Salah Diaz and Cody Gakpo, as Danso plays the ball forward towards Kuleseski, who gets it away to Johnson, flag stays down, Johnson will run forward, and it goes off the legs of Van Dyke, and it's a late flag, so it'll be a free kick, and Liverpool still lead by three goals to one. Back to Wembley in that FA Cup semi-final, John Southall. Forrest Niel, Man City won, but what a chance for Forrest in the opening minutes of the second half, Hudson Adoy down the left-hand side, there was a langer on his serve on his birth, they made the run eight yards out and somehow put it wide, Forrest Niel, Man City won. Talking of Forrest, Liverpool have dropped five points in two games against Nottingham Forrest. Before today, they've dropped 15 points in the other 31 games. It's extraordinary, some teams are your bogey teams, losing the game here, wasn't it? Which was extraordinary, but just looking at the changes that Spurs have made at the moment, they've made two changes in the midfield, that comes as no shock, considering how well the midfield for Liverpool has been playing, with Graven Berk and Mikasa, we were talking about. Pat Nevin is with us here on the World Service, as well as five live-in, the BBC sounds out where Liverpool are leading by three goals to one. The Sun still beating down on at least a third of the pitch here at Anfield, as Canate in the shadows of the main stand towards Salah. Sir Boss Light fouled. Mo Salah actually has scored 11 league goals against Tottenham Hotspur. It is the most of any player in this fixture. He will be desperate to get on the scoresheet. It's possibly the most surprising thing of the afternoon so far, but he hasn't had that goal that he usually gets, but we've got plenty of time yet. He'll be thanking you. If he doesn't score today, it'll be seven without a goal for Mo Salah, which will be almost three years of his longest goal drought for Liverpool. Although we mentioned earlier about Liverpool's tendency to score goals in the second half, 20 of his 27 in the Premier League, he is, of course, for the Golden Boot, have come in the second half this season. Sir Boss Light off the chest, tries to swivel and volley the ball forward. A doggie heads it away as he runs back to the edge of his penalty area. Salah in the back, up against Gravenberg. Gravenberg, too strong for him, comes forward with the ball, runs away from Bergvall, feeds it towards Robertson, drills it in low, blocked by Spence, out for Liverpool, throw in front of that Sir Kenny Dalglish, down on the far side, three and a half minutes into the second half, three-one Liverpool. And again, it's that duo again. Gravenberg right beside McAllister when Salah was trying to hold on to the ball, no chance, you ain't getting it, you ain't keeping it. We're going to break. They've been very, very good at getting close, not giving anybody sense to get on the ball and break and hold it up. They've been brilliant at it. Canate to Alexander Arnold, back with Canate in the centre circle. Van Dyke on the halfway line, passes the ball forward towards McAllister. His diagonal ball goes out far side the left, and Gakpo comes in now, that left touch line, left corner of the area, Gakpo still runs in field. He tees up McAllister, McAllister takes a couple of steps back towards Gakpo and unselfishly looked for Salah. He could easily have gone for goal, but they tried to put it on the plate for Salah and the opportunity went missing. I call when the earlier moves, some chess, I'm going beautiful for that one. It was absolutely lovely. One-two's, I mean, classic training ground goal, we would call that. I wonder if there was a possibility at all, say, no, there wasn't. One-two, beautifully done. Actually, more than one, one-two. I'm amazed they didn't go for goal. You're absolutely right, but it would have been the perfect goal, had that final pass been made. And when you hear a commentator or a reporter saying, they walked it into the net, that was almost it, wasn't it? Whether they just cut open the Spurs defence? They are pit-a-me of it, they are absolutely pit-a-me of it. And if you're playing against that, OK, so Liverpool didn't score, but it has a horrible feeling because they didn't panic. McAllister got the ball in the 18-yard line and instead of smashing it, he believed they could do that and they almost did. Choice of listening this afternoon here on Five Live. Liverpool leading Spurs by three goals to one. As the boss lie out towards Salah, Salah runs forward onto his left foot, charged down, and on Sports Extra, it was Noddingham Forest, Nile Manchester City, one, but there's been another goal, John Southall. Big moment here, Noddingham Forest, Nile Manchester City, two, corner on the left-hand side, and there was Josco Guardiola, six yards out to power the head in. Had her in long way back now for Forest, Forest Nile Manchester City, two. Crystal Palace await the winners in the final of the FA Cup on May 17. Arna Slott's name is being chanted by the Liverpool supporters. When they last won the title in front of supporters some 35 years ago, the attendance was just under 38,000. Anfield has been redeveloped since we got that two-tiered stand away at the Anfield road end away towards our left-hand side. The old Kemlen road is now the Sakenidau Gleestand. It's increased considerably here at Anfield, and every single one of them who has been privileged enough to be inside this ground for this special significant moment in Liverpool's illustrious history, he's going to enjoy every second in the second half as a low cross comes in and it goes behind for a corner kick. And it's one of those moments that psychology of the Cop is now working. You just look at that Spurs team, they are falling further and further back, being dragged back by the history of what the Cop does to the Liverpool players themselves. They just grow in the second half, they own the pitch. And at the moment Spurs aren't going to snuff, they're not going anywhere nearer than one-half. So this is a 10-foot slope from one side to the other. Liverpool have only lost one in their last 30 league games against Tottenham-Hotspur and they're in no position to surrender. The comfortable position that they find themselves in here this afternoon is being played on BBC Radio 5 Live. As our referee Thomas Bramble just has a wanderer cross into the technical area. I think that's Sa and Lewis Diaz who are getting very tight. The corner on the left is taken short, so Boss Lylin with a cross at the far post, it's headed behind by a backpedaling Kevin Danso, it's another corner kick, but on this near side the right, in front of those expectant Liverpool supporters, so many of them get out in red. One of the great things about Liverpool, it's a very simple corner, just out to a player who's maybe 15 yards out there, it's a quality of all you genuinely get in. And it doesn't really matter who it is, if it's Salah, if it's Robertson, that's the thing that's supposed to be right. You know Macalester's going to do the quality of the crosses in and be superb. Macalester's name is the latest to be chanted, they're going through the full repertoire, or at least they will do in this second half. Corner kick to Liverpool, Macalester to take it right footed. It's an out-swinger, Canate was up, might fall to Van Dijk, hooked away by Danso, looping ball, high drops, Tel, Tussles with the Boss Lylin, who squeaks the ball out towards Macalester, Salah wants it, Macalester shoots, takes an inflection, should go out for a corner, indeed it is Liverpool piling on the pressure, 3-1. I'm going to say it because you have to put in more Salah there shouldn't you? He's shot there, Salah's on his outside there, he's got nobody with him, no Salah will be in an angle there, he's in a better shooting position and he's more Salah. He's a big difference there, give it to more Salah in that position there, you're talking an almost certain goal so let's be fair to him, I think that's a Macalester mistake. A fellow Scott in Andy Robertson, we actually discussed this at half time, the luxury of the position that Liverpool find themselves in, every supporter inside Anfield will just be able to soak up this and enjoy the experience as we wait for the corner to come in from the left, and it comes now from Macalester and Bacario, claims it. Every single player will get his chance, but every single song that they can think of will get this opportunity as well, so I think it will be enjoyed and it gets towards the end of the game if Liverpool can stay at least two goals clear, the Crescendo will just build and build and build until the end. Bacario, almost caught in possession inside his six yard area. As the ball goes up towards Solanke, comes straight back though, Gravenburg looks for a free kick, Bergvall, as he fouls, the referee will say yes, it'll be a Tottenham Hotspur free kick, deep inside their own half, ten minutes into the second half. Manchester City, a leading Nottingham Forest 2-0 on Sports Extra, earlier Bournemouth won Manchester United won, it's how it finished in the Premier League, in the Women's Champions League semi-final, second leg Arsenal lead Lyon by a goal to nil, Spurs have given the ball away cheaply, here is Salah to Suboslai, and then running back with Zudoggi just to break it up inside the penalty area, and then they'll get... No, kept him played by DS on the far side, didn't go out of play. Spurs need to be better in possession than that. It's getting very angible at the moment, they're still really open, when they get the ball they're trying to play it out from the back, the problem is, the vicious in the midfield, they're winning it back constantly Liverpool, they're just that little bit sharper, better, quicker, better tacklers, reading the game too well, it's a nightmare to play against just now for Spurs. Well they've never looked like relinquishing the healthy lead that they've had for so many weeks now, remember they went top of the Premier League on November the 2nd, so what's that, 177 days since, they are not going to relinquish a two-goal lead here against Spurs, they'd be very surprised if they did. I mean football's wild, strange things have happened, they've seen it, you know, if Spurs could get a goal, they need to go over the half-way line to get a goal, at least I've not done very much of a toe in this second half so far, but it's so hard to see anyway, and that's going to happen by how well Liverpool are playing at the moment. Virgil van Dijk, who's played the most minutes in the Premier League, any other Liverpool player, 2,970, Alisson, who had that spell on the sidelines through injury, in the first half of the season, Robertson goes downfield, cut out there off the chest by Spence, a rare foray into the Liverpool half for Tottenham, but then coming back is Gravenberg, no, it was on that far side-gack, here is Gravenberg, now his ball towards the boss-lie, and the boss-lie's got room to run into, and he feeds the ball to the feet of Salah, and Salah runs into the penalty area, cuts into his left foot, and Salah, shot, takes the reflection, corner kick, free on Liverpool, corner on the right-hand side. You almost don't have to commentate in Salah when it goes down the right wing there, do you? He cuts into the right-hand side, he's across that 18-yard line, you know, he's trying to get half a yard for the ball. Just before that, the ball was one deep in midfield, and it's Gravenberg, and he threw a dummy in the midfield there, it was almost missed, the two players went flying, and it was just a little sneak-hit moment there, and it opened up the entirety of the play. It's easier doing a three-way knock, a lot easier to do, but it was a classy break. Andy Robinson takes two large strides back to deliver the corner kick on this near side, the right. Liverpool lead by three goals to one, left-footed by Robinson, canates up, Van Dyke tries to get on the end of it, McAllister has a volley, peels for handball, comes to the right-hand side of the area, falls to Salah, he tees up Alexander Arnall, Alexander Arnall, shaped to shoot, more humble penalties, Salah goes to ground, Ball scrambled away by Davis. There must have been about three penalty shots there for Liverpool, and at the end of that, the referee gives the free kick to Spurs for foul on tell. Well, they have a look at each other, the referee's telling everyone to calm down. Now, the first one would have been about harsh, smashed into the Tottenham defender there from no distance at all, and his arms were in, that's not a penalty kick. The Salah one, once again, I think that would be a bit soft in front of the cop. I'd be surprised if any of these are given, let's have another look at it, we are seeing... It was McAllister wasn't it, struck the chest of Dancer. Yeah, maybe even the shoulder, but his arms are down by his side, so not a problem at all. And the other one for the free kick, which I'm absolutely convinced wasn't the one as well, but the referee made no attempt to tackle. There's been another goal in Lyon in that women's Champions League semi-final. Victoria Polley. Is Lyon Niel Arsenal 2 in injury time at the end of the first half? Arsenal scoring a beautiful curling effort from the edge of the area from Mariona Caldente, means that they go ahead in this Champions League semi-final. Is Lyon Niel Arsenal 2 3-2 on aggregate? 3-2 on aggregate, with the right to meet Barcelona in the final. Arsenal's men will be hoping for success against French opposition in midweek. Commentary on Tuesday night from the Emirates, Arsenal against Paris Saint-Germain. Dancer steps forward, Dancer shoots, and right-footed. What was he, less than 25 yards out, dragged it off target, goal kick, still 3-1 Liverpool. We've been playing for an hour. Yeah, and that's what sports have to do if they're going to get back into this game. The problem is, when you play in the Rangers style, you want your full back to fly forward to doggie and spence. Now and again, fly forward, create some problems there. They've had the over the half, half-way line, have they? They've not got any good positions. That's because they're playing against good players, and they've just not got good position to be able to do that. It's very, very hard to create that. Oh, that was a mistake by Arsenal. The Cario under pressure from Diaz almost let in the Colombian, and then hurriedly he had to clear it out of play for a throw, but they've taken the throw whilst there are two balls on the pitch. I think the initial one from the Cario bounce back off the advertising hoardings, and therefore there's a stoppage, and that throw will have to be retaken. I'm ashamed of that. That's exactly the right thing to do in that situation. Take it very, very quickly. Spells weren't quite ready yet. They've got themselves set again, but once again, good control that far. My field from Van Dijk, just watching Van Dijk, just now, I haven't mentioned he didn't watch. Do you think he's broken his weight yet? He does it. Van Dijk, I think it says a great deal that he and Mo Salah have signed contracts, to sign that they believe that Liverpool will be able to challenge under Arnav Slopp for a season to come. Salah passes the ball, but Danzo clears the ball away. They're going to be the seventh team in Premier League history to secure the title with four or more games remaining, and they are not letting up. They're still coming forward. Gatpo over on that left-hand side, and this is going to be Gravenberg who's going to shoot, and the Cario makes the save low to his right. That might have been an awkward one. It might have taken a deflection on its way through. He saved it the second attempt. Yeah, I mean, a decent shot. It's from real depth distancing, but it shows you the hunger for all those Liverpool players. They're patting it out, only went to yard. Three nearest players to them, all wearing red. Chasing it in Diaz, chasing it in Salah, chasing it in Gatpo, chasing it, anything that's going to come off. These are not players that are cruising along here. These are players that want to absolutely put this to bed, and it's also quite like a goal. Alexander Reinal tried the back heel towards Salah, stopped by Odogi. The quirk about Liverpool's last title success five years ago, when Manchester City lost to Chelsea, it was the 25th of June, Liverpool won the title the earliest with seven games left, but it was also later than any other team in terms of the date because of Covid it was pushed back to the summer. Talking of Manchester City, let's get an update from Wembley. John Southall. Odogi, nodding a forest by two goals to Nill. It's all city at the moment, could have been three. Savino on the left of the area, pushed over the crossbar by Salah. They have a corner here now, as we said before, looks a long way back for Forest. Will they make changes? Surely they'll have to, for a still man city two. Coventry on sports section, Kuleseski forward for Spurs. Just as he tried to shoot, just taken away from him, and McCallison out to Savoslai. And there's a break on for Liverpool. Savoslai has got Dias to his left, he's got Salah to his right. He goes with the Egyptian, Salah onto his left boot. Salah shoots! Salah scores! The Egyptian King with the crown in moments, for the huge champion of England, and that is the 200th goal for Mo Salah, off that trusty left foot. He ends his goal drought, and Liverpool now leads Spurs, by four goals to one. Well said before, and the only surprising thing is that Mo Salah hasn't scored a goal yet. And if you could draw a picture of Mo Salah's goals, you'd draw that one, wouldn't you? He just gets it balling right on the side, he cuts across the 18-yard line, and he can put a back post on here, post. It doesn't really mark him. An indication near post, and he's going down and done a little selfie. Right in front of the cop, brilliant. Well, he's just made one supporter's dream come true. He's taken a mobile phone, taken a selfie in front of the cop. He now takes the acclaim, and Liverpool are coasting to this record. He's scored, equaling 20th top-by-tival. I mean, looking here, them saying it in the right, there's not any doubt now they're going to win the league. I mean, technically, what happened in that goal, if it's of any interest at all. Spence finally went forward on the right-hand side, because Kulesess could drag them forward. And by doing that, he's taking any control that they have about the defensive situation. When there's a weakness at all, Liverpool make good use of it. Kulesess, get the other end, meanwhile. Liverpool lead by four goals to one. 64 minutes played, BBC Radio 5 Live in the World Service. Gravenberg can't control the ball. Sar shoots, Allyson makes a save. Back to Wembley, John Southall. It's still Forrest Nell Manchester City, too, but what a goal this would have been. Morgan gives right on the right of the area, 14 yards out on his left foot on the volley, crashed against the bar for us, Nell Manchester City, too. commentary on sports excerpt. Otterberg's going to be coming on for Tal. Richardlasen is also going to be coming on. I think it was written in the stars that Mo Salah, with his 12th week goal against Tottenham Hotspur, would end his goal drought here today. One goal and nine. Wilson Otterberg. And Richardlasen waiting to come on. Salah and Tel will be the two players that will make way. It's just a shame they're supposed to break a little. They have a half a chance there, but there's not enough understanding between the players and Tel in that time. Just stop the run. You can't stop your run there. The ball's in the middle, Sar's on the ball. Keep on making the run. If it doesn't get delivered, it's not your problem. It's the deliverer's problem, but just not being enough understanding with those first players so far in this game. Well, for Tottenham Hotspur, they've got to try and turn their attentions. They'll have to dust themselves off. They did make the eight changes. Going into that game against Polo Glint. You'd have to feel as well all the ball giving away. Gatpo's nipped in. Gatpo, Mike Bortow, Salah takes over. Feeding towards the boss live. Beaten out by the Cario. Spurs are going to be so careful. They do not want to be going into that game on the back of the hiding. Yeah, and they can smell it, they can. They absolutely can smell it. They're falling apart a little bit of the back. They can cut out, they can cut the ball in the midfield. Just know it's four. They need to calm it down a little bit. Hold the ball if they can. They've just not been able to do that at any point in the same time. Salah trying to dance his way through to the penalty area. There's a real strong smell of sulphur in our commentary position on this day of celebration for Liverpool. Four-one they lead. Van Dijk urged to shoot. And Bytes fires it wide. Good 30 yards out, right footed up target goal. Kick Liverpool, four-one. Yeah, Van Dijk's shooting from there is actually ugly, unusual. You should do it more, because in his earlier career he scored some brilliant goals from there. But the boo here actually is slanking his off and Rich Alisson comes on. I think it may be Rich Alisson coming on. Coming on is a problem as opposed to Salah and coming off. As a former Evertonian, he was never going to be awarded a warm welcome. What is that? His four goals, incidentally, against Liverpool have all come at Anfield. Liverpool are going to make changes as well. 20 is the magic number as far as Liverpool are concerned today. And Jota, sporting the number 20, is one of the players coming on. So Boss Light comes off. Curtis Jones is another one who is going to be coming on. We'll wait to see who goes off. It is going to be Cody Gatpo. Cody Gatpo, who turns to take the poor dicks from the crowd. He's played with Alisson, a group reception he's got. Anyone who comes off just now will get a fabulous reception. And there's also a part of you that you want to be on at the end when it happens, when the whistle blows, when you become champions. But there's a lot of players in that squad that deserve to be on that field. Just now, incidentally, I don't think you could argue against Jota being on there. And indeed, Alit. Well, there are 40 medals that are handed out by the Premier League. Currently, Liverpool have had 21 players who have played at least five appearances in the Premier League to qualify to be guaranteed a medal. Keazer has only played four times in the Premier League. I wonder if we might see a sentimental touch from Arna Slott for Keazer to come on, to be guaranteed a medal. The thing is, it is the club's discretion to hand out those other medals. So I'm sure he'll get one anyway. Alexander-Arnold, forced towards Jota, breaks back towards Alexander-Arnold. Ponte Goldin! And on the goal line, it's Mo Salah. Liverpool are wrapping up a record, Eakling, 20th title in style. They now lead Spurs by five goals to one. Well, they're just sitting there hoping that it's offside. There's a possibility it might be. It's almost apologetic, they've been Mo Salah. He's got a big grin in his face just now. It was so easy for him. I said a few moments ago at the fourth one, you asked a half-time, you didn't want it to fall apart. It looks really messy, really, really messy at this period of the game. And he's seen me go through, there's an ugly line at the back there, it doesn't look good. And I'm looking at that there, it's very, very tight for offside, very tight. I couldn't tell you from the angle that we have seen it at. I've just seen another angle, I still can't tell you. It might be the right leg of Danso that he's just playing Mo Salah on. And in fact, before he got there, it came up Udagi. Fireworks are being let off in the distance. You've got to check that though, you've got to check that one, it's so, so tight. And if Salah didn't get a touch on it, you know, do you still see it's offside? It's the only reason why he defended it that way, it's because Salah would have tapped it and had he not done so. Udagi credited with the own goal if the goal stands at 5-1. I honestly don't think the Liverpool supporters will care, such as being the carefree celebrations that they've been able to enjoy with the nature of the way that this game has gone. But the goal does stand. And Liverpool do leave 5-1. I have to say, I don't think Salah thought it was going to count. And he was the nearest person to that. And a number of others didn't think so. It was very, very tight, it's 5-1. I'll tell you one thing, it hasn't been tight this game. They're absolutely curious. They play brilliantly, but in the second half, they've tried to hold together a squad, but this is no beginning to look quite ugly, particularly for the manager. Well, and Costa Codlou, you've got to say that, I know what could still happen in Europe, but he's had 47 points from his last 42 league games. You say that your league form is the true barometer. To credit, a lot of the Tottenham supporters, they have stayed in the away section away towards our left. As Otterberg comes forward, a rare chance for them to attack in this second half, with 18 minutes remaining. But when you consider that their record Premier League defeat was at Newcastle in 1996 by a scoreline of 7-1, this could get messy with still 18 minutes remaining. It could get messy, and it's partly what Liverpool want to do about it, but the Bryan players, the Bryan cutters joins just now. And Eastamon, he's just dribbling about and joining himself. The quality has not dropped. A deafening cry of champions inside Anfield. It'll be Liverpool's 70th major honour. 20 titles, 29 cups, 21 supercups, England's most successful club. Manchester United, the closest to them was 68 after this title, here today for Liverpool. And they're lapping it up. The Spence shoots from a long way out, just 35 yards out, well off target, goal kick. Back to Wembley, John Southall. Forrest Neal, Manchester City 2 should be 2-1 now. Gvardiel gave the ball away, Morgan Gibbs white round the goalkeeper, tight angle, his shot came off the left hand post, and if Forrest lose this game, he will not forget that moment. What a chance it was, Forrest Neal, Manchester City 2. Liverpool top scorers in the Premier League, taking their tally to 80, and they've scored at least two goals in 29 of their 34 Premier League games, as they win the ball midway through their own half, and Jones now can run forward in the all red of Liverpool. And then was barred Stover, and the referee will give a free kick to the home side, just outside the centre-circle patnevin. Yeah, but this seems so lively, even at this part of the game, they're desperate when... It's best to try and go forward a little bit. They're living for that moment when they win the ball back again, and every red shot seems to fly forward, apart from Fintyte and Canati. Everyone wants to get in in the act today. I actually think every single one of those Liverpool players out there thinks they can score a goal today. They can tie the end of the season up for themselves with a goal, and enjoy these celebrations even more. Here is Canati, there's going to be two more players who are going to be coming on. It'll be Llewis Diaz and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who are the players who will make way with some 16 minutes remaining of normal time. It was Alexander-Arnold's goal, of course, at Leicester, that put Liverpool in a position to wrap it up here today. As again, Arna Slott's name chanted reciprocally by this Anfield crowd. Salah can't control that ball of around knee height, runs away from it, out for a goal kick. What a beautiful ball of Llewis by Trent Alexander-Arnold. And it is classy for a man because we know what he can do with his right foot. He just goes on his left and pings 140 yards at a weird angle and just puts it right on him, so it couldn't quite get a hold of it there. But it just shows you the quality that Trent Alexander-Arnold's got. If he does leave, he will be missed at this place. I'll tell you something else, he'll miss this place. He'll be missing him. You know, it's funny, Pat is six-leaf just to my right-hand side and yet when he talks, the noise being created by the Liverpool supporters, it's hard to hear him. Llewis Diassi is coming off to a standing ovation as Elliott and Mdow will come on. Diassi's been good again today, obviously scoring the first goal, calling back into it. Just watching down there, Trent Alexander-Arnold, getting everybody to applaud Lauda, I think he wants... He's trying to soak up every second of the season, isn't he? Which makes you wonder, it does make you wonder, but he's loving it, he's enjoying it, he's reacting with the fans, and he's showing the weather harms he cares about this club. Yes, very much so. And then with Carlo Ancelotti, he'll be... won't be the Real Madrid manager next season. There's so many red balloons now on the playing surface, there must be at least a dozen. All didn't seem well when I was in the Bernabau the other week with Arsenal. They're going to have to try and pop those balloons that are now blowing towards the centre-circle. Some of them are being waved away in the bottom tier, the seconded-out-league stand as well. 14 minutes remaining, we're in full party mode now, Pat. Yep, balloons and everything, yes, we really loved that. And there's not really been a huge amount of attention for Liverpool. The only attention is how many goals is it going to be. And since that fourth goal, they're going to stop the game now, and these balloons burst. They can actually put the players off a little bit. But in fact, the tension's gone, the enjoyment's there. Sunshine, lovely warm day, enjoy singing some songs, and they'll get fed up singing them in about 14 hours' time. Those balloons are literally being popped. I think only for the sake of four minutes was Liverpool's party deflated when Solanke, a long time ago, gave Spurs the lead. Liverpool lead by five, goals to one. Another goal in Lyon, Victoria Polley. Green first half for Arsenal, and they've continued that almost immediately after the restart. Alessia Russo has extended Arsenal's lead, they've overturned the deficit, and they've gone further ahead in this one straight after half-time. It's now Arsenal who lead at Lyon 3-0, 4-2 on aggregate. What an excellent scoreline that is for Arsenal, as they look to try and set up a meeting with Barcelona. Liverpool have 12 minutes remaining, they're leading 5-1. Gravenberg, who's had an outstanding season, so effective, talked before about Virgil van Dijk playing the most minutes. Gravenberg, not that far behind him this season, his fellow Dutchman, two players who really have bottomed under there. Fellow countrymen in Arnau-Sloch. Just looking at a thing that happened in the pitch, it was very funny. You always get a lot of humour and leather too. They were bursting the balloons with their feet, and everyone is ignoring it. And then one of the balloons that was burst was the actual trophy. The whole place, dude, because a sparse player had actually burst the trophy of the balloon. The referee's stop-play. You can all remember the beach ball moment with Darren Bentot at Sunderland all those years ago, one of the balloons. It's almost as if the balloons are breeding. There's more balloons than there were before, they're having to be popped now. So we've got the remnants of the red of pop balloons on the blank surface. Mo Salah has picked one up and has actually just squeezed it and popped it with his hands as that deflated silver balloon, whether it was the two or the zero, just gently rolls its way towards the... I think that one was the trophy. Oh, was that the trophy? That's why the Liverpool fans say about Fjordis, how dare you stand in the trophy when we're going to win it? That's what they all say. Straight to Emily, John Southall. Forrest Nill, Manchester City 2, but our Forrest have had some chances in this second half. They've hit the post and they would work three times now, one year with the latest, Gibbs White on the rebound, header save, Forrest Nill, Manchester City 2. Coventry continues on Sports Extra. Match of the day tonight, incidentally, 10.30 on BBC One. Cross from Johnson on the right-hand side, Otterberg couldn't get there. Endo, who's playing at right back, instead of Alexander-Arnold, that goes out for a spurs throw. We've got ten minutes remaining here at Anfield. Five live, the World Service, and also available on the BBC Sounds app. And if you're a Liverpool supporter, wouldn't necessarily suggest this to any Tottenham fans, but the beauty of the BBC Sounds app is that you can go back, rewind and listen again. And the noise that has been generated inside this ground by the Liverpool supporters, as they raise the volume once more, is certainly that will live with many, I would imagine, for a long time. You must enjoy these occasions. As we say, right at the start, at the top of the programme, it doesn't happen that often. Even for the great clubs, it's quite often you go for long periods without winning these championships. And the better this championship, they've won it in style, they've won it early, just as I'm saying that, they'll remind them maybe it's champions, but, you know, savour it. You know, some clearly have worked showbiz for Scottish Football a lot and sell it at one of the 13 and the last 14. You know, even those fans don't take it for granted every single year. It's very, very special to win a league. So savour every morning here at Liverpool, fine. Either here or listening or watching. A historic weekend in north of the border, as well as in England, of course, with Celtic. The record equing 55th top-like title yesterday. Liverpool will join Manchester United, equing their tally of 20 here now, with nine minutes remaining, as a Liverpool player down on the far side, who's obscured to me because of the towering presence of Van Dijk, it's McAllister. It's McAllister. Let's get the solo one in the face. We're going to have to do a lot to keep him down just now, aren't we? He's a hard lad. But also, everybody wants to be on this pitch. With nine minutes of normal time left to play, you'd love to be on the pitch. And someone else is going to get a chance to go on the pitch. I was going to say on the window, what's up, there? Reception, Darwin, Nunes, OK. But anyone could know they're red, so we'll get a good reception today. There has been a report in Portugal that his next start could trigger a clause that would mean that they have to pay something like 5 million euros to Van Fique, that Arnaz Sloc just tried to dodge in his press conference coming into the game. It's fair to say that Darwin Nunes may well be moved on in the summer. He's only had one start since early February. But he has become a little bit of a cult figure here, just because of his hard work, his desire levels. And he waits to come on, and it will be Macalester who will be going on. As Liverpool prepare to make another change. Yeah, another new attempt to try and tell you, was that some level of play in just now? They've just given people a game as much as anything else. And Macalester's got a great reception here, hasn't he? APPLAUSE Stunning ovation for Macalester, a high five from his manager. And Darwin Nunes comes on, as every Liverpool supporter inside Anfield stands. As part of the celebrations with seven and a half minutes remaining, still there is a healthy number of Tottenham fans who have remained loyal to the end. They will need their supporters to play their bit. They'll need the team to play their bit on Thursday as well. You can't help but feel they're going to need some sort of a healthy lead to take to Norway with that plastic pitch with a second leg. In just over, well, two weeks' time, or less than two weeks' time, in the Europa League. That's the look forward to on five live during the week. Champions League semi-final on Tuesday, Europa League on Thursday. This is the Premier League, five live in the World Service. And Liverpool leading by five goals to one. Canate back with Van Dijk. Van Dijk's record, there'll be the 11th different Liverpool captain to eventually get his hands on the title. There'll be the first touchment to captain a team to a Premier League title. But he's only had three defeats in what now will be 117 Premier League home games. Leads Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. That is a very impressive record. Yeah, it's a great record and the stats sound great as well. But it's more than that. I mean, there is a big argument about Mo Salah between the two of them, who has been the most important player for Liverpool over a good long period now, in a real successful period. And where Loat might say, I think Van Dijk may be slightly more important because of what he's done. They're on and off the field to the group, what has shown them. And the genius of his play as well. Lele Lele Le is the latest champion side on field. Salah picks up the ball on the right-hand side. Tristan Wrigley's way past the doggy and cleared by Saat. Mo Salah, who is likely to win the Golden Boot for a fourth time to equal the record of Thierry-Henri. It'll be his first Golden Boot in three years. Yeah, but he never lets you down. He keeps on going. He keeps on doing brilliant, brilliant possessions. I think he's looked better this season as it's going on. He's usually a little bit of a dick, but you'll notice even within that, he's still creating chances, he's still creating goals even if he's not scoring them. But his numbers over the last number of seasons for someone who's not set her forward are just ridiculous. A reminder, we're on air until 7 o'clock tonight as Salah picks it up and pays the ball in and it was cut out by... The doggy who just threw himself at it at the near side of the six-yard box to divert the ball away for a throw. We'll try and bring you as much live reaction as we can before we hand to 606 with Roman Kemp and Chris Sutton. But if we're not able to do that before 7 o'clock here on Five Live, then don't forget the Five Live football daily fee. We'll bring you all the reaction as we soak up as much as we possibly can down in the tunnel here at Anfield on the significant day for Liverpool Football Club, who leads Spurs by five goals to one, four and a half minutes of normal time remain. I just see him on date playing one of those balls that he's so good at. He doesn't do it as often, you know, he used to do quite a lot. It's a 60-70-yard pass, he's languid, he's pinpoint, almost puts Andy Robertson through. But he chooses his time to play that ball now and he used to do it much more often. I think he's looking after his stance, doesn't want to give the ball away. Harvey Elliott wanders across as he acknowledges the supporters by clapping back at them in front of the corner and then he takes it quickly to Curtis Jones, edge of the area, Jones shot, takes the inflection loops in the air, Vicario's come, Vicario hasn't got there, the referee's blown his whistle. Free kick to Spurs, still Liverpool 5-1, just over three minutes remain. And Liverpool just love to get another goal. Tottenham in the moment, would love that final whistle to blow. It's been a really chastening second half for them. They've tried to get forwards as often as they could, but in some attempts, in almost every... Well, let's take away the almost. In every single position, they've been second best today. And Liverpool, who have been the best side in the Premier League this season, remember they went on that 26-game and beaten run from mid-September to early April. Are just minutes away from being confirmed. But the supporters throughout the afternoon have just been enjoying every single second of this. This is the type of afternoon that even those of a nervous disposition were just able to sit back and revel in. What a relaxation it is, if you're a Liverpool fan, to just enjoy this, just to sing along, watch a team playing good football, having scored five goals, and most of all, running it, people just enjoying themselves as well. From the left of the ball by a doggy, no foul, up towards Rich Ellison. Pushed over from behind, Liverpool supporters enjoyed that, and it'll be a great kick to Tottenham. No reaction at all from Rich Ellison. There is no answer in a day like this. You just get your head down, you work. The vast majority of players that play at a total level have actually found themselves, you know, at and field, in the wrong side of a beating, when you hardly can get a kick to the ball, you just get your head down and work, you just deal with it. And as soon as you get off that pitch, you get off it. This is going to be an 11th defeat on their travels for Spurs. Only Leicester and Southampton have lost more on the road. The last time that they lost 11 was the 2008-2009 campaign. They finished 8th that particular season. They're actually on course to finish lower than where they managed 21 years ago. That was when they finished 14th in 2004. They could say that they're going to focus on the Europa League, but it has been a dreadfully disappointing campaign when you consider that this time last season they were 5th. They were in a position where many people now are clamouring to get to. Yeah, expecting to just move on from there. It just hasn't harmed the height of Pat Virgale. Pat Virgale with the cross headed away. Still testing for it in the Liverpool half, and now Jota passes it all forward. Nunez pulls it back towards Salah. They were desperate for Nunez to go for goal himself. Salah towards Elliott. Elliott shoots, blocks, and then down with header. Elliott will pick up that loose ball, looks to link up with Robertson. They could have had another there. You know what people are going to say, don't you? That's Darwin. That's the problem with Darwin, isn't it? He's one-on-one, and he tries to do the right thing, and it is the right thing if you find the player in the middle there. But it's a poor ball, it's ahead of him. Just zip it into most Salah's feet. You cope with anything, you don't need to put it in front of him. You cope with anything. He plays it too far in front of him, but there's another part of the things. Look, Stryker's trying to do the right thing in pass when 95% of them would try and smash it towards the goal. You want to applaud them, but... Difficult to do it with Nunez. Easy ones, it makes him mess off. The hard ones, let us in at the top corner. I think that would have just been the moment, wouldn't it, for Darwin Nunez to have got that goal. Four minutes have added on time. Is it going to cue doing this somewhere as soon as you've got the 90th minute? He starts singing this song. Always the case. And only now... ..as a banner being unfurled in the Cop with a picture of Arnaz Slopp that reads champions for the 20th time. 24, 20-25. As the red and white scarves are held aloft all the way around Anfield. There's a solitary flag that waves in the Cop and now there is another banner in black and white. Arnaz champions. Arnaz champions. He tasted success with a title in Holland with Feyenoord in 2023. His first season in English football. He will be a champion in England. Intriguing to see the reaction, you're going to get down on that bench. You know, you're only supposed to have one standing up at a time. Well, there's about six or seven or eight all standing down in that technical area. And even though they've known it for some time, I mean, maybe weeks, maybe months, they're going to win the league. The interest is he, the reaction from all the players from Slott himself, from all the staff there, because it's been a long wait. And whatever they do, just get on there and enjoy it. Nunes forward for Liverpool. Jones, Jotter. Nunes will shoot. Blocked by Dan Sobe, high in for a corner kick. We're into the second minute of the minimum of four to be added on. The cameras are trained on the Liverpool bench. The Liverpool substitutes are turning to wave at their loved ones behind them in the main stand. A line of stewards in their orange luminous jackets are sat down in front of the advertising hoardings. A red smoke bomb is away towards our left-hand side. Another incessant chant of champions, champions. Reverberates inside Anfield. They lead Tottenham by five goals to one. In comes the corner, headed away by Davis. Van Dyke to Canate. Helps it out, Robertson can't keep the ball in play. And now the chance of we shall not be moved. It's just a question. And we're about 60 seconds away, Pat. Yeah, Rich Allison, he can go back there. I'll make him very popular there. And I think it's certainly a challenge, and I'll get a Yermol Cal. I wonder if he'll go both ways. Yeah, Arvelli will get one as well. No need for that at that moment, but you can tell us about a frustration down there, as you're Rich Allison. He tried hard to keep his head down before. Fielding the execution. Elliott and Rich Allison, both booked by referee Thomas Bramble. Harvey Elliott wouldn't want to be sent off on a day like this, as the substitutes and the coaching staff down below are all poised. They're embracing each other in the technical area. Cody Gatpo going down the line. The two Dutchmen embrace. The Liverpool striker and the Liverpool manager. By my watch, we have 15 seconds remaining. Liverpool lead by five goals to one. Fireworks being let off outside the stadium. Vicario catches the ball. They're forming a line ready to celebrate. They said five years ago that it didn't feel real. Well, it feels real now. Five years ago, due to Covid and social distancing, they were unable to celebrate. The only distance now is the 15 points that Liverpool have at the top of the Premier League. And for the first time in 12,783 days, they are able to celebrate in front of their own supporters. Liverpool are back on that perch. It's a record-equalling 20th shot-glide title. Finally deserved. Congratulations to Liverpool and all the fans as well. They showed today. You want to walk out in your last game when you win it to come off thinking that's why we're champions. And they did it today. It's a lovely feeling as a player. If the moment is that special, and it is beautiful, and you have scored the goals, and you can celebrate with comfort, with the joy of it, with the pure pleasure of knowing you deserve it, you're the best team, you play great football, and you're going to get better next year. What a great feeling it is around this place. Celebrating, and this is just the start. There must be at least 20 red smoke bombs that have been let off, not just in the carp, not just in the Saqueredal Gliche. Not just in the Anfield Road, but also in the main stand. There's a line of stewards that have formed, not one supporter has entered the pitch here at Anfield, and with the sun still shining, and so much clear blue sky, Liverpool have so much daylight at the top of the Premier League, and they are going to enjoy this, because they are the champions of England, beating Tottenham-Hosper by five goals to one. Five goals to one. And these inside Anfield are just amazing scenes, when those fireworks started to go off outside the stadium, the thud, boom, boom. It was like the collective heartbeat of Anfield coming out of its chest. The air is thick with sulphur. A red cloud has just emerged to our right-hand side. It was a remarkable moment, Pat Nevin, when Mo Salah scored, because it felt like the emotional dam inside Anfield cracked, and then the full-time whistle went and it broke. Yeah, as you say, we'll wait a long time if you're a Liverpool fan. I'm sure you might have thought, they will say, we have waited, and waited. So the fact that you can go and watch Mo Salah go and finish it, Mo Salah, of all people, nipping from there, and just ping it down the bottom corner, it's like perfection, and to win the game and get five goals, after just a little bit of jeopardy, just a tiny wee bit of jeopardy at the start of the game. And I don't think as a Liverpool player who woke up there thinking, I didn't play too well today, I played really well. Everyone all think that I had a good game today, my team had a good game today, the manager would think, I put a good side out today, the fans would think we played our part today. I'm really struggling to find, well, not that I'm waiting for a win, but I'm really struggling to find a negative of this day for Liverpool Football Club. Well, the Liverpool players now are right in front of their fans, Trent Alexander-Arnold is down there, whipping them up again, Mo Salah is now just draped in a big Liverpool flag in front of the fans to the right-hand side, and all of the signs and all of the banners are out now. I could see in the last few minutes those fans down to our right looking at each other nervously with their flag. Is it time to get it out? Shall we wait? And then it emerged, Arnav Slopp, Liverpool champions, 20 times. This stadium is different to others. Some stadiums, you will see the history of them all over the walls inside the ground. This many trophies, this many titles, this many victories. In Anfield, Pat Nevin, as more fireworks fly up into the sky to our right-hand side, the history emerges from the cock, the banners go up, the signs go up, the fireworks go up. Yeah, to be honest, you can go away to black and white days all the way back to when there was no seats in the cock, and the different way that that looked through the other stadiums because the fans were moving almost as a mass, almost as an organism, and you look at it now and it still feels like a real stadium. There are some stadiums around the country that don't feel real. Even in big moments, right now I'm looking around a stadium. Can you see one empty red seat? Nope, and you won't see one for quite some time. It is loving the football, loving the moment, loving what it means to their city. There'd be lots of great banners. There was one banner, I think, stood out very well there for me. There was just a picture of the Liverpool's signature back on our perch. I thought, oh, that's clever, that's neat. They've been waiting for that one, and it's kind of, this club kills that. This club kills it if they deserve to be right on top. It's been hard for Manchester City to be so dominant for such a long time, and Liverpool have chased them down so many times. They've got them once, but this time they've actually been able to enjoy it. That's not always been the case, has it? They've been able to enjoy this bit. These last few games, but right now, and until the end of the season, it's just fun, it's just celebration, it's just singing. Well, we've been saying all afternoon that Liverpool fans have been waiting since 1990 to celebrate a title with their players on a day like this. Back in 1990, we didn't have mobile phones. In 2025, Mo Salah took a selfie when his shot hit the back of the net. Harvey Elliott has just booted the match ball. About 30 rows back into the cot. I can see down there, a couple of the Liverpool players have got one of those fake Premier League trophies. Ryan Gravenberg has got one in his hands there. Well, they won't get their hands on the rear one for a little while. That'll be the last home game before the end of the season. I can see Trent Alexander-Arnold again right in front of the fans down there. Mo Salah is just standing up on top of the advertising hoarding. And as those fireworks finished, I mean, you don't often see stars on a sunny afternoon, but that's what it looked like as they burst in front of us. And the stars are down on the pitch as well. And now they're being serenaded by the Liverpool supporters. By the way, it has finished in the FA Cup semi-final. Manchester City have beaten Nottingham Forest, Arsenal are four-nil up at Lyon now in the Women's Champions League, and it looks very much like they will be going through. But Anfield is alive, so let's let them sing. Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,",
