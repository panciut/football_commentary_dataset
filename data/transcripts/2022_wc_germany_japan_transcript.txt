 In Russia four years ago Look for redemption Four times winners of this Tournaments they are playing from left to right Against Japan Who will certainly make for a difficult group there will be no easy ride for Japan or indeed Spain? in in group eight Rudiger at the heart of that German defense recovering from a hit problem Muller shaking off a groin ishry, but a groin injury, but there's no Sane who's been ruled out with that with a knee injury as it's a very slow start from Germany back towards Neuer all in yellow away towards our left-hand side and I mentioned that drum that might meld the Back drop to our commentary throughout as their their arms are waving in that small block of blue away towards our right-hand side Schlotterbeck lifts it forward for Germany Muller up against you to Nagatomo The the left back with his dyed red hair and that bouncing ball have to be headed away by Neuer outside of his goal But for Nagatomo a certainly a proud moment. He's now 36 years of age But he's the first Japanese player to appear in four World Cup finals and ever present in the in the previous three As here is Gnabry to the edge of the area cleared away by the Japanese defense seat Just picked up that ball what a central area Are you expecting that that front four of Germany to rotate a little bit Chris? Yeah, they'll be very fluid and they've started off with Havertz as the central striker Well, that wasn't dealt with at all across from the left-hand side Muller with his back to goal played it a long way back to Rutiger now to the burly figure of Sula the the right back Gnabry on the inside and cleared away and swept to safety from It was your sheet up who got his foot through that 34 years of age the captain Nearly 200 appearances in eight seasons at Southampton at a time at Sampdoria But now one of the players playing in Germany for for Schalke As Germany seeing a lot of the ball With that was Schlotterbeck now in there then Kimmich playing in the midfield comes over and takes over The Germans have set up as a four two three one Kimmich and Gündo and in those deeper lying rolls will see Ram on that left-hand side the left back Better going forward. I think it's fair to say than defensively But up top Havertz is the central striker Muller just in behind him with Musiala off that left-hand side and Gnabry off the right-hand side Well Chris you were you were in Kazan weren't you in South Korea? Pulled off that upset to knock Germany out of the group stages last season Sorry the last World Cup by two goals to nil and indeed you you you watched Japan give Belgium a real scare as well Was it in the last 16? Yeah, but last they were two up one name It's Maida tries to get around the back of Rudiger. That was a good old foot chase there for Celtic forward against the former Chelsea defender Rudiger. Yeah, he's that's his strength days of Maida His pace he'll make those runs in behind his hold-up play isn't the cleanest but Japan have got some players and really talented players in the middle of the park who look to get on the half turn And slide balls into days of Maida who will make those runs There was the customary team photo Ahead of the the game and while Germany posed for their team photo They put their hands over their mouths as a cross from the right-hand side from junior Eto gets a corner kick But every single one of the German players Put their hands over their mouths for the for the team photo and we say that the German FA We've been supported by Denmark are looking at possible legal action Certainly early in the week Germany the the Federation said that all of the associations In the words of the German FA came Under extreme blackmail To work to drop the one love armband so that's going to rumble on Corner kick to Japan far side the right out swing headed away by Ganabri and out of play it goes for a throw five minutes in BBC radio five live BBC sounds as well Not just for the live commentary, but also for the World Cup daily podcast And indeed match of the days top 10 episode 10 is actually out now But episode five if you wish to to rewind That's going to cause great debates in light of Saudi Arabia's victory against Argentina yesterday because Carol Inaker and Koeh were discussing the biggest World Cup upsets Cameroon Argentina Senegal France the United States against England in 1950 That would be mine. I wasn't born then but neither was I I think much happened was the age of two then but certainly Argentina against Saudi Arabia Will be added to that list, but if you want to find episode five then BBC sounds There is so much World Cup material At your leisure and of course BBC sounds you can listen to the commentary and then just scroll through the website as well as listen But six minutes played here so far nil nil and it's been a slow start chris. Yes, I was tentative uh from Germany Japan just easing the way into this game. They've set up with with a back four and then What's your row? Endo just sitting in front of that back four. He'll be the enforcer In there getting the screens on and stopping those balls into the likes of havert Up top for Germany He was a doubt coming into the game with toro and oh defensive midfielder for stuttgart He's uh Certainly a player who they were able to get off. There was another doubt over mitoma of brighton and hobalby Endo recovered from from concussion, but mitoma had a little bit of illness. He is on the bench The the brighton player who's certainly impressed in the early stages of his career at the the amex As for arsenals tomoyasu rested against canada last week with a calf problem Not fit enough to start nagatomo clears away for japan. He hoists that high And it drops towards kimik to gun do an Central area of the japan half Dispossessed though there by kamada who now runs forward He's got ito away to his right hand side here is ito plays it in my Flags of a foresight And the japan celebrations are cut short very very quickly from that flag that was raised on the right It was an excellent break by japan. Of course it will go to v.a.r He was offside It wasn't a great run from made up Of course because he was offside, but there's a warning for germany Kamada stealing the ball off gun do an and just popping the ball out right to or well offside ito But it there's no reason for him to be offside in that position He and he just gets beyond Rudiger as the cross comes in. It's a brilliant cross, but Made us looking across the line there needed to time his run better. It's good finish from him That's a warning To this german team. This is the way japan are going to try and do it this afternoon They'll be difficult to play through they'll sit a little bit deep at times and then they'll look to counter At pace Well, we said before didn't we when we were talking about the game in the build-up with mark Chapman that this german defense You can get at it and that was a prime example It was gun do an dispossessed in the midfield kimada carry the ball forward out towards the right And as christson says if tyson made it Just times that run better he would have had a Real opportunity for the goal ends with i mean he put it away well, but he was a good yard offside and you know he's He's behind rudiger the balls on the right hand side rudiger the right center half He's behind him and should look across the line and time his run Much much better But the issue germany have is because ram the left back gets plays so high up the pitch. There's a huge space on that right hand channel for japan gun do an chips the ball out towards that far side The toe was back to challenge round in the air out of play it goes for a germany throw It's interesting when that drum stops beating and we said about feast or famine with the atmospheres Bearing in mind that there doesn't appear to be too many empty seats in a ground that holds over 45 000 people Very very quiet As it's just been proven there when that drum stops for the stadium with the exception of the Top tier over on the far side that is still bathed in the late afternoon sunshine Felt very very hot today in doha around 28 degrees, but certainly inside the stadium very very cool The air conditioning working extremely well the cool the pitch certainly around 21 degrees and it certainly will never go above 27 inside the stadium So that will never be a problem in any of the H stadiums that are being used this of course was the one that existed before kata won the the right to host the World Cup Remember coming here with england against brazil and a friendly in 2009 although it has had a little bit of redevelopment work since then but it's nil nil you're listening to five live also available on bbc Sounds as the ball is picked up in the in the midfield For musciala in a in a central area and because he comes central it creates a little bit of space for around the left back To venture forward and he's quite high over on that far side the germany left He's playing like a left winger, isn't he not playing like a left back So high up, but that's the space the germans leave On the counter schlotter beck just stepping in there Blond hair defender into round good one waits for the run of round ahead of him hangs onto the ball now finds the left back That the challenge is is quick to to come in on that far side and Japan deal with it. Well, it was tenaka who was helping out on that far side itos forward ball Kamara was going forward just stepping out of defense was Ruriga to beat The japanese midfielder to the ball and it's back with schlotter beck once again and we've been playing for 11 minutes all the good play from japan has come down that right hand side, but Looking forward to seeing tecufusa kubo really young talented player plays his football in Spain Musciala gets around the back on that far side the the left ball is stuck out and cleared Out of play it goes for for a throw That was endo who was back there helping out musciala who really is a Terrific talent in an excellent form for bayan 12 goals. He scored and he's 22 games for bayan And you look at the the front six of this germany side four of them actually play for bayan So there's a real influence in this german side one of them was it was kimmick challenged up to the edge of the area ball played away On the edge of the area by it's akura yashida's fellow central defender schlotter beck forward kimmick central area back out to schlotter beck round holding his line trying to playing it playing him in but that was Again cut out by sakai the at the right back and then itu hits it long And as christus said maeda of selting is he's quite fast. He's he's hard running On that occasion he was an unwilling runner. It was too far over his shaven head and through towards noia What they are doing though japan they're defending in numbers, but as soon as they win the ball back It's kamada who's looking to break as well making those forward runs At times you feel as if you're in a footballing library don't you hear so silent? Wasting for something to happen as musyala runs in off the back of his man and now on that left hand side Gets the ball back to kimmick able to turn kimmick shot Is a good block Tanaka wasn't it made the block kimmick Just for a second looked like Had a shooting opportunity 25 yards out and made a shot with his right foot, but crucial block from tanaka Rudiger onto the ball right of the center circle goes out wide to uh to nicholas Schuller formerly off by it Now we saw him In the champions league for barashi, adorment Is yoshi or kimmick Now chips the ball out towards round, but easily headed away by sakai and unchallenged leap forward, but at the minute It's germany who are picking up all those balls in the midfield christen uh, yes, it is but I mean they're not hurting Japan at this moment in time everything is in front of the back four japan really well organized as we expected looking to pounce and counter Interesting cool. Sula at right back from hansy flicky that has played there predominantly for uh, dauntman this season, but Doesn't look the most mobile does he sometimes big guys like him don't but uh Kara had the option of playing kara westhams Kara in that right back position But we're i think we were told when we before the game. He's one of the tenth quickest players in the bunders league Yeah, sloth again going. Yeah a little bit like me You mentioned kara kara actually played i know you dismissed the the warm-up game against oman last week But kara did play as the uh, the right back in that game And you think that that was a huge advantage and for the Germans going into this tournament playing a friendly against oman who were ranked 75th Not quite sure they were my words, but i'm not going to argue with you Yeah, i'd like to play that back. I think we can go if you've gone bbc sounds. I think we could play that back very good The manager will be pleased with that one. That's an unusual trail for bbc sounds take the world cup with you. Yeah Yeah Yeah, you can't forward wind but you can rewind Corner kick to germany 0-0 this is where they have a distinct height advantage, don't they the Germans 15 minutes played corner kick to germany The japanese supporters with a beat of the drum our salvedorian referee Ivan Barton was just having a word there with a couple of players schlotterbeck was one of them I think he was up against their endo So we're waiting for the corner kick to be delivered and it comes now from the left plenty of heights on it Ruder goes with a header just drops wide It's been about 10 yards out quite deep inside the penalty area and it was dropping What would have been the near post as we look the the right hand post from our position here in the in the main stand in the calipa international stadium But it dropped wide it'll be a goal kick and it remains goalless She think it's I don't think it's a great header at all It goes wide, but it Ruder good should head that back Trying to head into the the far corner not trying to beat the keeper at his near post And then maybe the likes of havertz or some of the other german players in the box Could attack it and get a touch you go back across the goalkeeper in that situation So each he gone to the goalkeeper all in green away towards our right hand side was looking to try and hit the ball out Towards the right he went central german he got it back but now they've lost it And it's with endo who plays it back to yashida and he goes all the way back to the goalkeeper Who's got enough time to control it with a right footed touch and then strikes it right footed and floats the ball out Towards the far side for the the royal blue Of uh of japan who are playing from right to left But they've lost the ball again in the midfield and there was a clear side of frustration there from the hikamada the 26 year old midfielder as we're back now to it A gentle walking pace as it remains nil nil in these opening 17 minutes on bbc radio 5 live Morocco nil Croatian nil yet another goal as draw in this world cup And uh, you know when you you sort of like your temp fate and you your message One of the bosses and you go don't worry Rest assured this one won't end goalless and i said that with a with a degree of faith because None of the last 50 world cup matches involving germany have ended goalless the last goalless draw was actually 1986 a quarter final against mexico i was gonna say that so I speak with a degree of confidence that we will have a goal In this game here in the califa stadium you have been wrong before though i've been wrong many times before chris as uh a free kick goes against japan and uh mori yasu A 54 year old coach who was appointed in august 2018 for japan Turned away in frustration. He's uttering a word towards the fourth official as shot a bet comes forward now for Germany every outfield player is in the japan half It's gun douan's ball towards ganabri with a cut back on the volley Yoshida first time clears it away Bouncing ball is headed forward by zula now towards kimik, but it was havertz with the challenge and that was on Takufu sakubo and it'll be a free kick to japan And it's been a very quiet opening 19 minutes nil nil very cage. I think japan will be Happy the way things are going just had to be watchful in that situation ganabri will see him More than any of the other german forwards make those runs in behind The japanese back line there just getting the run on nagatomo the pass from gun douan But yashida right places the right time to make the clearance The familiar voice of christ sinton with us here on bbc radio five live musiala far side the left schlotterbeck goes back to uh to rudiger And now it's with mula a little touch from thomas mula gun douan just outside the center circle of his own half And zula's diagonal ball to kimik a couple of touches to gun douan now to musiala Gain drifting into a central area round little flick back towards musiala excellent challenge coming in and the shot from kimik Beaten out by the goalkeeper and then the rebound comes out of the penalty as he know offside Offside flag was up on this side. I think he did point to the spot for a push didn't he initially The referee when the shot came in It was kimik who found this is a very good save wasn't it? Yeah, it was a good save broke to him quickly Clever little flick initially from gun douan, but he's offside And then he's he's shoved when he gets The shot in gun douan shoved from behind but all the relevant because he was offside have a look It's a decent hit from kimik puts his laces through the ball He he reacted well suichi gonda away towards His right hand side because it broke very very quickly to uh to yoshiwakimik Who last scored against italy in june and he only had one thing on his mind. It was a powerful drive But then as the ball came back there was an offside now ball inside from It was kubo who pops up on the right hand side and they've got another corner kick here japan as a result still 0-0 21 minutes played five live. Yeah, it was really good pressing from kubo sloppy from schrottabek and kubo gets away from down that right hand side and made a had the run on suhler in the middle And unfortunately for japan kubo Hit rudiger and the ball goes behind for a corner To japan just needed more care on the cross there kubo The japanese messy is known as well Let's see if he can conjure up something like messy as uh cross comes in And it was aimed towards it's a kura Does play in his football in spain, but not at basalona rail sociadad should have been a corner of that i think germans awarded with gold kick Yeah, it came For german defender there didn't it went behind ram off ram the back of ram Two more games to come for you as the matches continue to come thick and fast on five live throughout this world cup Where every match on five live and bbc sounds is live spain costa rica from four vicki sparks and rob green john murray and deon dublin Seven will watch belgium against canada But this is the opening game in groupie And the winners of this would take on those in in group f. We're already morocco nil creuational In the in the last 16 as the ball musyala regains staying central kimmick out towards ganabri high off the chest Right hand side midway through the japan half suhler joins the attack japan though defending in numbers and defending well Haven't really had much joy so far germany have they certainly none of this right side Haven't really Open the japanese back line up At all you know the effort from kimmick from 25 yards decent save from gondar. That's been about it They are getting more joy on the left hand side Or less a back three when they're in possession now Round so high up on that left hand side Just very quickness of passing It's maybe what they've been lacking the germans through the middle of the park Here is uh schlotterbeck gave away both penalties When england played germany in the in the nations league in munich annett at wembley gunduan Little ball threaded through musyala darting run Nice little ball inside towards mulla. Mulla returned it, but japan repelled the attack However round forward inside havertz down towards the byline looking for the cutback into the penalty air It goes it's akura missed by sakai the right back with his attempted clearance from it's akura's header in his direction And germany get a throw Over on that far side in what is a very expansive stadium this the kalifa international stadium And It is going to be a throw to germany, but not much urgency and in fact, I just wonder if the referees told them they can't Take the throw because they're looking for something through var Because there is a definite pause in play Hard to see what any infringement would have been possible penalty A possible penalty check so here comes the argentinian maro vinciliano and it was fine endos sliding in on havertz, but Play's back underway and it was a relatively by var standards a quick check Decision no penalty the fact that players resumed. I think we were able to work that one out 25 minutes. I hadn't worked that one out Here is schlotterbeck By the way, we talked before about the Germany team photo and that every player had put their hands over their mouths Germanis on their social media Feed have said we wanted to use our captain's armband to take a stand for values that we hold in the germany national team diversity and mutual respect together with other nations we wanted our voice to be heard As I just break off because kimmick on the edge of the area plays the ball out towards ganabri ganabri with the cross over the head of havertz round tease it up Gundogan shot charge down kimmick heads it into the penalty area And it's okura clears the ball away and it remains nil nil And I'll continue to to read the rest of that that statement and it continues It wasn't about making a political statement Human rights are non-negotiable. That should be taken for granted, but it still isn't the case That's why this message is so important to us Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position Armband or no armband. We stand by our position Whereas the captain underneath that team photo And just to reiterate they are looking at legal action against fifa You're listening to five live and BBC sounds it's nil nil Back to the action musyala in the penalty area round in support Sakai with the clearance the right back They're getting a lot of joy down that left. They are getting a lot of joy, but you got a credit The japanese backline and the midfield they're working so hard and they are so disciplined Tracking the german runners. There's always a runner going in behind from the german forward areas Here is gun douan gun douan an extremely silent stadium to Sula his forward ball first time layoff by habert's muller was under pressure Ball went back to the edge of the center circle, but rudiger was there Germany still in possession ganabri with a little dummy runs through towards muller on the right hand side He now cuts it back to ganabri in towards gun douan's first time shot And gonder with a say there's a really clever piece of play from ganabri initially Let the ball run between his legs and muller Who is beyond him cuts the ball back inside and one touch two touches to gun douan. He's 25 yards out He tries to whip the ball in beat gonder at his near post, but It's a quite a tame effort It's a long way out 25 yards out and gonder it gathers Slotter back with the the throw on the far side Rudiger you're quite pleased with that one aren't you? Here is uh is gun douan To uh to rudiger aren't they strange these these hushers which happen every It's quite it's quite eerie i've got to say GUNABRI GUNDOUAN man over is round plays the ball into him round goes fires it in towards the near post comes out towards gun douan That's blocked cleared away by endo inside the penalty area. They're just starting to knock on the door at germany Round with another cross headed out this time by it's a corner and out for a throw But again, how much space did round have as it was played into him on that left hand side? You know what? I think it's a really poor pass out to round I think gun douan could have taken the pace off it a little bit But round fires across in left footed and gonder out smartly diving pushes the ball away and then Japanese cleared the ball eventually And now they are on the attack with the kubo on this left hand side But he's just simply wrestled away by rudiger and then kubo fouls rudiger But that was just like now shall not pass from from rudiger I mean it's a little bit it was like a doorman lifting someone out of a nightclub, wasn't it? You've probably been in that position a few times. Well, I would imagine that rudiger would have Bearing in mind the physical mismatch between he and and kubo that would be quite easy. I think he wouldn't have He wouldn't have lifted me off the ground as easily although I have lost nearly a stone in weight Half an hour playing Here is Sula. He definitely wouldn't have lifted Sula off the ground Sula is that burly he could indeed be A doorman on a on a nightclub with his broad shoulders but At a walking pace we go once again for Germany in possession slowly patiently building from the back 15 minutes to go to half time See there They are a back three when they're in possession canabry staying wide on that right hand touchline round really wide on the left Here is uh, kimmick kimmick to round round completely unmarked enters the penalty area was he fouled by the goalkeeper the referee Yes, yes, and a penalty round took it away from gondor gondor clipped him and the salvo d'orean referee gives a penalty to germany well He gave the penalty the referee and then he looked like he was a little bit unsure, but I thought gondor He looked guilty didn't he that left-hand side. It's a brilliant ball clipped in good run from round. They haven't dealt with him They're checking it. It has to be sufficient Contact The player to go down. Yeah, I think he catches him doesn't he? gondor He's saying he didn't but looks like there was enough contact That must crisp that must be the third At least the third time that realm has been In yeah a position like that with so much space around him Well, I thought I think it's sack high. He's playing so narrow There's a right back musy ala Takes him on the inside and then it's really important that ito stays disciplined. He didn't he switched off and round Had a lot of joy down that left-hand side made the run Took a decent first touch Through the goalkeeper gondor and now big chance for the Germans. They don't miss penalties He'll cut gunduan certainly doesn't he's yet to miss For Germany Well, that was a delayed reaction from the crowd when it came up with a penalty for the ar on the big screens gunduan against gondor Gondor Gonduan runs up now and scores since gondor the wrong way and Germany have their opening goal at the 20 22 world cup And it's seven out of seven for ilkai gunduan from the spot and Germany lead 1-0 Yep, we all expected that outcome cool as you like gunduan Shapes to go to gondas left whips it across him To his right hand side gondor goes left Confident penalty Germans getting the joy down that left hand side Doesn't go right in the corner pretty centrally, but gondas gone One nil to the Germans He was unable to gather it in and as he dived away It left a gaping hole from gondor For gunduan with the goal And it's one nil to Germany I can't get my head around the atmosphere It's like we were ready for the penalty to be taken and everybody was obsessed With the giant screen and when it said var goal given Then then they were cheering that decision rather than realizing the ball was the ball was on the spot on the penalty spot That was really strange you You know should get the idea if you watch football regularly that when somebody puts a ball on the penalty spot it means penalty So Germany lead by a goal to nil five live and dbc sounds here 11 minutes to go to halftime and uh japan who we haven't really seen much as a great deal of ambition so far from A japan team that was certainly free scoring in qualifying a record 58 goals. They won 15 of their 18 games I mean they're passive. Yes. Yes, they have been but they've set up the counter attack and it's all very well Isn't it at nil nil I'm not sure sure things will change too much at one nil at this stage, but I have been too passive Sakai on the overlap good ground on that right hand side, but It was round who was back with him doing his defensive duties He's hardly played as a left back throughout the whole game so far But on that occasion he did take it away off the toes of the Japanese right back and japan who haven't really done anything in open play Have now got a corner kick on that far side the right to take it which kamara is going to take So this should be an out swinger if he takes it with his right foot on that far side the right Blue shirts white shorts from right to left as we look and we've got under 10 minutes to go to halftime Kamara it is an out swinger and it's headed out by a commanding a rootiga And then nagatomo with the back pass To gonder the goalkeeper who plays it forward to nagatomo who is quickly being chased by three white shirts So japan have to quickly clear the ball and now they win it through sakai Leaps into the air referees played the advantage and it's a good advantage too Because japan now with kubu scoops the ball in towards the penalty area But gunder an was back there helping out off his chest and now it's up to musy ala musy ala to get abri on the halfway line On this near side the right out for a throw and it will be a germany throw chrissa kubo should have made much more of that Kamara he made the initial challenge. I just wonder whether the referee is going to revisit the challenge on kamara The strong challenge was it from schlotterbeck On him but no card But kuba had the opportunity to whip the ball in earlier took an extra touch And then the germans got defenders back in numbers Have to make more of those opportunities Yes, they certainly do because they've been Few and far between in this first half and we've been playing for 37 minutes Here in the caliphe international stadium where germany lead by a golden ill from this penalty spot taken by Manchester cities ilkai gun du an But it's with Itung far side the right No impression whatsoever germany dealing with that threat and kimmick to gun du an I can actually hear a fella shouting from the far side Takes you it takes you back to when you used to Come and take playing behind closed doors If you've just tuned on or tuned five live now or BBC sounds and you're thinking Oun is in this stadium Not many empty seats You wouldn't think 45,000 Canaveral shoots from distance that was blocked ball played out Now it's with havertz right corner of the area to thomas moeller moeller sends over the cross left foot in It was back there helping out Schlotterbeck 25 yards out musy a la with the shot up in the air punched down into the ground by gondor comes out to kimmick Ball played into the penalty area low Nobody seemed to want to have a go at goal there as gondor was having to retreat to his goal line But germany looked very very comfortable Yeah, at this moment in time japan eventually will have to change their game plan. They're happy to defend in numbers and break out but The germans have that swagger that arrogance. No, I think the issue with the crowd said to one of our producers Last evening it's a corporate crowd, isn't it? Braun sandwich brigade Well, actually it there's probably more empty seats in the in the corporate boxes Mind you have not surprised with the the eye watering prices that you charged in there, but they didn't appear to be too many in those burgundy seats in the the middle tier some behind glass some out in the open I mean, there's a large chunk of royal blue on the far side, but The japanese supporter are silent. Yeah, well, they're losing Um, but it may be the lack of alcohol as well in the stadiums People get louder after a drink don't they? I wouldn't know here in Qatar Six minutes into the into the second half Well, they could that japanese traveling support needs to take a Peter lesson from the red wall because the when when wales Support when they were behind the other night against the united states. They never stopped singing As Kubo is forward, but he won't keep that ball in play Actually he does with a cutback now. It's a late flag. Didn't think he had He's actually gone down with an injury as well There's there isn't much Where there's a switch from the turf to the artificial turf that can cause problems for players You haven't yeah, I mean, it's it's the same in you know in in english stadiums, isn't it there's A couple of yards of grass i think of old trafford they've got those little slopes, haven't they at the camp? Yeah, and you have players of great pace Who are up to speed it's hard to decelerate Germany won japan nil Gunderman from the penalty spot the german supporters away towards our left are trying to start off at a mexican way There's an atmosphere breaking out here is uh ganabri on this near side the right There's not a wave breaking out and that was one of the smallest Ever wasn't it stopped? Yeah, well Maybe what do you say the corporate brigade aren't used to tossing their prawn sandwiches in the air Here is uh gunduan gunduan from distance charged down and picked up And it's eventually taking off It started off as a ripple And now all of a sudden it's sweeping around this vast stadium that holds 45 And a half thousand people here inside the calipa stadium where german he lead by a golden ill And it's with musiala round the game marauding back towards musiala He goes off to mula back towards kimmick Layed it off just inside the d kimmick outside the d right footed shot always on the rise And it will go out for a goal kick. They are in total control though. There's the wave again it's Oh, it's going around now it Not the It's it's going all the way around now here, isn't it? Yeah, I'm tempted to join in Japan Playing at such a sedate pace It's actually had that Feel to it throughout There's got to be a little bit more intensity For uh for japan Three kick has been given to uh to germany As he continues to go around the ground round seems so much the ball with the cross aim towards mula in the area picked up by gondor I think that's the criticism of the Manager marie yasu that He sets his team up quite negatively If they want to get back in to this game I'm gonna have to Try and take the game to the germans much more and go toe to toe. Maybe that will happen, but they're on one to concede a second Number being in moscow four years ago when germany lost their opening game to uh to mexico First time that they've lost an opening game since 1982 On the balance of what we've witnessed so far in these 43 minutes There's no chance of germany losing this one they lead by a golden ill There's every chance that we'll have to hope that mark chaplain set an alarm clock for him to uh to resume Presenting duties as kibbit close the ball forward Moussiala keeps the ball in play as he takes it out of the penalty area on the right hand side the cross from ganabri headed back by round The couture has headed away only to the edge of the area. Moussiala plays it in towards round That was risky for him. He'd so let it go across his body He's actually conceded possession. He had a chance to clear it, but he's given it back to germany We've around the left back who's played really is the left winger throughout the first half Such as doing the dominance of germany all in white playing from In their white shirts and black shorts from left to right Here is gunduan There's no there's no jetty in the game No jetty from japan. No just trying to hang on in there stay in the game That's the game plan, but you have to be adaptable. Maybe that will come but they are playing with such fear So tentative they're not given the germans anything to think about And the germans totally dominant All played out by noyya to schlotterbeck who can pick up that ball about 25 yards out from his own goal He's over the halfway line and he's now midway through the japan half as he lays it off towards gunduan We hear german voices inside the calipa international stadium Germany lead by a golden ill musyala shot turn on the shot right foot on the rise Just on the edge of the area Couldn't keep it down gold kick 1-0 germany close to half time. Yeah razor sharp from musyala Gets on the half turn dynamic creates a Half a yard of space should do better with the shot balls fist indivite kimmick It's akura who comes out tries to shut him down, but quick touch with it outside of his right foot away and then he lifts the ball Well over gondas bar Four minutes have added on time in the first half As there's a another stoppage sakai has gone down on the far side I wouldn't have said four minutes Probably you have said 60 seconds One one stoppage with an injury no substitutions What is it that the uh figure of wanting? I don't mind this I don't I don't mind it, you know The balls that have played a lot isn't it see players time waste you just want you want your pie. That's what you're thinking about Argentina, Saudi Arabia, I think they played about 15 minutes of Stoppage time in the second half that's like having a game go to the first period of extra time It's one bill to Germany. We're in stoppage time here in Qatar DBC radio five live And it's a throw to japan on the halfway line It's that they've shown such a lack of ambition. Maybe it will come in the second half Here is havertz Again, they're attacking on the left. Busy Allah round on the overlap. Busy Allah goes in alone Entries the penalty area pulls it back to ganabri ganabri drips to the left corner of the area rounds available to him Level the penalty area here. He is he goes inside. Busy Allah always sharp Swear pulled back Sula joins the attack the right back What about the dig didn't blaze it out towards mula crosses around knee height Hard for gimmick to control that ball inside the penalty area and japan will get it away But it's going to keep coming back out of them This is all about how much germany and bearing in mind when it comes to the criteria of the group goal difference Could be key and this potentially could be a difficult group You would think that germany would want more goals than just the one that they've got so far Yep, that pretty much sums up Japan's first half performance at yashida getting the ball edge of his own box nothing on and just punting a ball into the channel Eventually goes out of play I mean they may as well go home japan if they're going to be this negative A sense of adventure surely awaits in the second half Wales before the first half against the u.s. The other night But they put in a much improved performance the coach changed things rob page incidentally Fridays when Wales and englander next back in in action Four games a day He's still got spain costa rica in this group to cover four followed by belgium canada at seven And then tomorrow switzerland cameroon brazil serviet that's at seven o'clock Many of the favorites for brazil against serviet europe by south korea torsigal garner in group h He didn't game tomorrow I'm doing a game every day for the next three months. I think Germany chance maybe in this stop is time to increase their league in every pixel up runs into the space He's got support musy a la plays it out towards mula mula to the byline chips it towards the far post Downward header comes towards it's a cooler shot comes in close range Wonder whether he's offside Just wonder whether he's offside. I think the germans deserve to go in at the break more than one up The looking for the flag but the flag is stayed down Certainly vr will have a look as it was crossed from the left hand side. It was a simple tapping for kai havertz He did have a little glance around But japan never dealt with the danger. No the ball stood up from mula And it's headed away kimmick with a left footer shot. He is outside won't count Yeah, it's musy a la. I don't know whether it's a shot or a cross and havertz centrally just beyond I think it's It's a yashida Yeah, it's a shot I think from The wide area As the shot came in initially from kimmick it was saved by the goalkeeper musy a la then from the left hand side But the assistant referee never raised his flag at all even late So what's going on here there the vr are having having a look again I mean all the players are set up to kick off again aren't they from the center circle Here we go We're taking the time aren't they well I was going to say through a vr check that surely has to be one of the easiest ones First glance that we saw it on the monitor we were able to say that it was offside You can hear the japanese fans are happy with that maybe we'll see another wave around the stadium Well Certainly it's a less off for jupan because there have been no way back from two nil down the way they played in the first half But kai havertz's goal in first half stoppage time ruled out for offside Nakatomo with a cross from the left and the header just wide it was by a 12 yards out Just tried to glance it by adjusting his upper body And it ran wide by about a good two yards to the right hand post fast side one nil germany Yeah, nakatomo just creating a little bit of space chops inside On his right foot whips a ball in and here made a 10 yards out it's a difficult one because it's behind him And he's just trying to use the the pace of the ball It's an in-swinger to direct it on target but it goes wide It's the halftime whistle Halftime germany japan by a golden ill japan had a goal ruled out for offside in the early stages after eight minutes It was into with the the cross beta The good yard offside and then Gundewaad with a penalty put germany ahead after 33 minutes and then germany had a goal Quite rightly ruled out offside for havertz from close range in first half stoppage time So halftime here in the kalifa international stadium. It's germany won Mike japan nil Chris Yeah, yeah I'm marketer knee there. Oh, did you take any headphones off? What would you do? No, no, I just Silence there and myself and Ian looked at each other bemused as we have done for most of the first half Japan's performance is As much as anything It's been a strange performance from the japan. We know they you know, they like to counter attack But they've shown a real lack of ambition especially after the the german goal germany have had a lot of joy Haven't they down that left hand side? I think it was a penalty Um, you know ram was brought down as a gondogaf And then the germany have just dominated and you know nearly had the second just before halftime What do we know? We know that japan have to be more adventurous in this second half and and risk losing the game to try and get back in the game But I've been slightly disappointed with japan's reaction After the first goal more than anything because you know, it's okay to set up and and try and keep things tight And you know we understand that and it's okay to set up the counter attack But the goal changes everything and you know, I'm sure second half Well, I'm not sure second half, but I'd like to think that the japanese who have some really creative players show more intent in the second period You've both talked about the crowd during that first half Do you think at all it some of the crowd noise doesn't sound very authentic to me? I'd I thought that during the england game at that stadium Do you know what? I've got a suspicion that the section where They are banging the drum From the right hand side. They are a good two three four blocks away from the main support of of Whether japanese fans in their thousands on that far side and you know that there were some england supporters who were Came over to katar and they were invited over by katar I just wonder if they are the the hired help okay archery and took football German football expert been listening to the german commentary of this which obviously is not at the standard of ian and christ I would imagine Archie what have they been saying? What have they been saying about that first 45 minutes? It's a bit less moany than chris isn't it? Well the funny thing for me was as soon as the the gundewan penalty went in like after all this uncertainty from From the germans before this tournament suddenly the commentator goes well the first goal in the world cup in 2014 was also a penalty But let's not get to ahead of ourselves So yeah, I think on the whole it's been encouraging but also like there's something about the way that The germans look at football that they are very very critical And I was having a chat with with daniel farka the from a norwich boss and and brucey mentioned glad back coach now About this and he says it's something in their nature that sometimes they overdo it That said I think that there is still a worry about even if as christ says there's been a lack of ambition From japan An old problem rearing its head again with that disallowed goal by japan early in the in the first half With just how vulnerable germany looked on the counter and this is one of the weaknesses of hansey flick I would say as a coach is that he can be so attacking at times That at bayan he could get away with it because he had this wonderful defensive mop called alfonso davis david raum is good But he is not nearly as as quick as alfonso davis is and yeah, that's just one thing for germany But overall encouraging first half for them and on the one love armband the german interior minister Nancy feiser shown wearing that one love armband in the stadium The german team for their team photo putting their hands over their mouths very much like players talk to each other at the end of Of a game actually, but the but the german football team twitter account Saying it wasn't about making a political statement human rights are non-negotiable. That shouldn't be taken for granted It still isn't the case. Sorry that should be taken for granted, but it still isn't the case That's why this message is so important to us denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position I think it's significant This this protest but at the same time I think When we look at what counts as being powerful In sport you have to sacrifice something and the question to the players at the heart of this whole armband saga was How much do you care about what has happened for this tournament to take place? and I think that too much They've wanted to have their cake and eat it And look would it have been more powerful? Have they gone ahead and won and worn the one love armband? I think it would have been because that would have been a direct contradiction This I think works as a gesture, but it still does feel Like it fits in too much with Yeah, everything else. I think You need to step over the line in a different way for it to really have a powerful effect Archie for the moment. Thank you very much three minutes shy of two o'clock.

Would you mind doing me a quick review? You're doing brilliant. I've been doing you on radio two. You're a very nice man. Thank you very much Every time this comes on radio two, I turn it right up The heads go in the shoulders go in I'm like bouncing around on the seat Probably one of the world's most embarrassing mums because of your show scott mills on radio two Tell all your friends on that school run to turn radio two on as well. Oh, yeah, absolutely scott mills all the way weekdays from two Listen live on bbc sound bbc five live the FIFA World Cup katar 2022 with mark chaplain Unbelievable from radio two They're so worried about all of you coming over to listen to us rather than listening to scott But they're now putting trailers out of him right at the time he's about to start stick with us Germany lead japan by golden ill the other two teams in this group spain and costa rica That follows at four o'clock vicky sparks Hello, good afternoon mark I mean with rob and we are looking forward to this one. Yes Good excellent excellent. Yeah rob green alongside vicky Spain will be feeling exactly the same as germany Prematch rob won't they in in that the fact that these two are in the same group. They need to get off to a good start I think even more so for spain in the fact that they are playing the game Probably the least fancy team out the group again costa rica punching above their weight to qualify getting here They thrive or have created their success on defensive know how not so much on attacking prowess So to keep the ball Is what we know spain for so then to go and score the goals They haven't got the out and out they've got over a marata. They've had a problem in giving him arrest or Taking his place as such and so the goals where they come from against a really dogged side Is going to be the question today for spain. Yeah, you feel like with the other two teams looming They need to come up with something today Spain have been improving vicky under Lewis Henry K who of course is is twitching his way through this world cup He's such an interesting character, isn't he to watch down on the touch line He's contracting to then he is up at the end of the year and he says he won't sign a new one until after the world cup because If things go wrong you and by that he means the media won't have to ask me to be fired But yeah, I think what's so exciting about spain at this tournament is what we saw at the euros as well And of course they they reach the semi finals and only lost on penalties To italy is that there is such a young attacking feel about this side But but it's a young attacking side that is already so experienced I mean you've got pedri and gavi who are Doing so well at a club level for for Barcelona and often when you talk about young sides coming into a tournament You're looking for maybe players that people haven't heard of or ones that are going to take a tournament by storm and by surprise But that's it when you look at this spain side. Do you think yes? Although these players are still young they feel as though they're already doing it on the big stage Domestically regularly we can we count for their clubs A lot of them have had experience of the euros as well Last summer and can they then go all the way and let's not forget spain's under 23s at the olympics last summer as well Picked up the silver medal against brazil so it's it's this this generation coming through of course with the experience heads such as Sergio busquets as well, but the mix is exciting very exciting for spain that game kicks off in two hours time It's two minutes plus five here in doha and darkness has already fallen Let's just switch to england jordan pickford's been talking to the media ahead of friday's game against the usa He was asked how harry cayden is doing after he had a scanner on his right ankle. I think he's good Um, probably be a little bit sore, but I think he's fine. He's out on the grass today with us So that's good and he's a he's our captain and I think he he's fine. Yeah That's a huge relief to a lot of people in this room and to england fans all around the place I mean is he there's so much talent in this england squad So I mean no disrespect to anybody else in the squad, but is he the one player that's irreplaceable if he's injured No, I think everyone will take the chance. I think when harry came off um About 70 minutes calum come on and played really well got the assist for jack He's very unselfish and give jack his goal and um, I think everyone's training really hard Everyone's here for a reason to play football and um, yeah, but obviously harry Is unbelievable player he's he sets the example in the squad. He's the leader. He's a captain and we all look up to him Um, but yeah, there's also opportunities for volads as well garrus already voiced Concern that england were used as an example of a goal that shouldn't stood in the in the referees meeting The penalty shout against harry didn't go your way How worried are you that england might face unfair treatment here? Yeah, god brought up in the referees meeting much wish we were involved in um, but hopefully we get fair fair side of it and um, You know, it's never going to be perfect. I think you're never going to get both Be happy all the time with ve our decisions and but you know, I think harry's one was Could have been a penalty from even my point of view, but yeah, you can't can always be perfect from the referee side and um Just hopefully we'll we'll get our decisions when we feel like we need them Jordan pickford there um the main thing rob green on that is that that harry cayne is out on the grass despite having his scam Yes, and after the game he was seen wearing a light strapping now with an ankle injury Normally what you see is Even as a precautionary measure the boot that we see so often with injured players on having it put on Just to make sure to keep it immobile to take the weight off that wasn't deemed necessary So it clearly was a precautionary scan Hearts are always in mouths and uh, I thought actually jordan pickford did quite well not to take that personally when they asked Is he the only player not to be replaceable? Thanks very much How would you how would you have responded to that? I wouldn't have been asked Well, there is there is strength in depth though at the keeper at the keeper position, isn't there? Yes, and you you'd look at that and you look at harry cayne and look at what the qualities that he does have and Callum Wilson has different qualities as a centre forward now some games they might be more suited to callum wilson, but you would say The the amount of goals purely alone that harry cayne has brought in such Important situations and such a big stage that he is the man and he will be for this tournament alone But if they didn't need to risk him against the usa, maybe they could maybe they could maybe they could leave him out Get the points on the board, please and get it over the line And then you know what I think wales might turn around and say actually if you want to risk him for a game or Easy moth for a game then let it be us, but uh, yeah Get to six points. Let's move on and uh, and then take a call from there because Monday to friday is in the tournament stays quite quite a big gap for us. So there's enough time in there at the moment Okay, vicky rob. Thank you very much for the time being there your commentary team in two hours time for spain against costa rica Which is the other game in this germany japan group at halftime Germany lead by golton ill chris, uh, talk about the prawn sandwich eating brigade during the first half my researcher Here during the course that half tells me that you've been having quite a lot of prawn sandwiches on this trip Uh, who's who dropped you that? Yeah, you're your roommate Oh, did he yeah? Yeah, I'm a one trick pony really. Well, I mean I wouldn't you know I'm surprised he's gone there with the amount he's eaten on this trip. So he needs to be careful my roommate My other research tells me you have beef and cheese sandwiches, which sounds absolutely revolting Well, that's all yeah, well, well he I got dumped the other evening By by bruce. He went out with john Murray and and everybody else, but I was working And so I'll bet yeah, I'd beef and cheese sandwiches for two nights on the spin. Pretty nice actually I'll make you one. I'll bring one down one evening. You're absolutely fine. Thanks. I'm I'm okay on that This game has got back on the way. He had whenever you're ready I was ready about 30 odd seconds ago, but I was quite enjoying the fate they look on chris's face when you Took him by surprise talking about the prawn sandwich brigade, but I've got something important to say that we've had a substitution and Tommy yasuo of arsenal has has come on And he has replaced cubo. So it's a defender for a midfielder Gone to they've gone to recenter halfs. You're sent her backs now, haven't they so sake is the right wing back so japan playing from left to right robles shirts white shorts gonder is in goal sake now as the Right wing back with yashida it's akura and tom yasuo as the Three central defenders Utu Naga tomo is now playing as a left wing back Which then leaves tanaka kamata and endo in the midfield with mayada and ito as the two up front Run through the germany side in a moment, but germany are on the attack And the shot coming in is blazed over by Gnabry right hand side of the penalty area He went for glory there So we'll get chris's thoughts on that after i've given you their starting lineup as they play from Right to left with noir in goal back for of sulla rudiger schlotterbeck and round the defense Kimmich and gundo and the goal scorer from the penalty spot in the first half Gnabry muller musyala and havertz chris Yeah, it's almost moody with a Driving run just popped the ball out right to uh, zucanabry Hangle a little bit against him what from 12 14 yards out blaze the ball well over the bar the germans will be thinking Let's get another goal and put this game to bed I don't know all the goalkeeper takes a chance there gonder for japan change of formation change of system I don't know what It is in japanese for park the bus, but that's what they did in the first half They have to show more intent in this second half They really do get support up to daisen mader who's been very very isolated Germany then lead by a golden ill in this the second of four games on what is day four of the World cup marocco nil Croatian ill earlier spain costa rica to come followed by belgium against canada as japan Play the ball back to uh to gonder the uh the keeper who doesn't look at all Too comfortable that his feet let it run a long way out towards his right hand side before he hoisted it away downfield And I mean that's that's odd in itself. I mean daisen mader isn't the biggest Junior ito isn't the biggest and the ball launched downfield and The german centre halves are going to gobble that up All evening aren't they ball just lifted into the path of gunder one inside the the centre circle And then yashira just steps forward. Does it quite hard and low into the feet of kamada? and japan unable to hold on to the ball once again and Just as we had in the first half as a lot of supporters are still Walking up and down the steps coming back from the gangways taking their seats. It's that subdued atmosphere once again with the exception of that Band of japanese supporters detached away from the rather large bulk of blue on that that far side It was somebody sent a message. It made me laugh On social media was keith escot who said listening to five live sport chris sarton and ian denis On the german and japan game guys the atmosphere is so bad. I hear It's so bad. I can hear what sounds like a bird song I tell you what that could be the next idea for the roommates bill and ben chris sarton and alice to bruce ball for The five live football daily or the world daily well cup daily as the shot comes in on the edge of the area from kamada takes the Delection you could do the birdie song and you're matching pajamas Ha ha ha ha Well, yeah, we'll have to get the alcohol license before we do that uh, but this uh, ito Actually takes a tumbly dives inside the box. He's better than that ito It's simulation world cup simulation I'm calling out for that but try and have a corner I don't I may be wrong. I don't get this though in comes the corner from the far side headed away by moeller They're not the biggest the the Germans have such a height advantage over japan. They haven't tried to work anything short the three corners. I think japan have had A bit of invention Nagatomo heads it away yashida loses the ball it breaks towards gunduan 25 yards out from goal Musiala flicks it along the ground towards round level with a penalty area left hand side musiala always looking With a real threat excellent footwork by musiala what a goal this could be And he couldn't keep it down He jinxed his way in towards the penalty area He weaved away from the challenge and then right footed by the penalty spot He got the conversion. It was over the crossbar one little germany goal kick. Oh, what a goal this would have been It's almost as if the ball is glued to musialas foot Chops inside at first coast pass three four Japanese defenders and needs to show A bit more composure there He ballooned the ball well over the bar when he should have scored 12 yards out big opportunity worked the opportunity superbly well for himself Germany's still leading by a goal to nil seven minutes into the uh to the second half Japan certainly don't have happy memories of Qatar they refer to the tragedy of doha That's how many talk about a late two on defeat against iran followed by a two-two draw with with iraq that cost japan a place at the World cup and the 94 uh a version in the united states and indeed they actually lost to katar in the UAE in the asian cup final in 2019 And certainly here just haven't really got going trailing by golton ill. I I don't know what Brand of football they're trying to play I haven't got any had any real real patterns of play to get up the pitch It's really quite odd. I didn't expect this performance to be this tepid from japan A real combination play and they've got some really good technicians in that midfield we spoke about kamada They played exceptionally well in the bundas league at this season Endos a good player Tanaka comfortable on the ball, but they haven't been willing to play Japan are coming forward now Kamada forces the ball out to sakai on this near side back towards kamada side onto goal Crosses the ball out towards the far side and then it's balled out wide and out for a goal kick And it goes out for a goal kick to uh to germany Yes, it does they uh actually worked the ball pretty well into the box and The decent cross from Tanaka, but just Not able to hook the ball back across the six yard box, but Are we finally seeing japan Get off to the germans and noya takes a chance heavy touch there Away from may do put him under pressure just a little bit of panic from noya I wish I'd never read out that tweet about the expression about the birdie song that was a unintentional pump because I've now got the birdie song in my head every time I can hear the the person who's uh, who's whistling Germany won japan nil They finished Second in their group for qualifying behind Saudi Arabia But we saw the intensity and the energy of Saudi Arabia against argentina offside against kamada And that really has been lacking From japan Yeah, it's it look as I said, um, you know in the first half It's okay. You sit you you set up you have a game plan, but the goal changes everything kamada there really that's a good line from The german line kamada makes his run too early But maybe we're just seeing The signs of change now Japan pressing the germans higher up the pitch trying to win the ball Higher up the pitch but it runs the risk of the germans playing through them Well they're coming forward now and they're looking threatening and round Toward to havertz havertz that creep off his line won't get there the second attempt It comes out towards musyala tries to roll it in referee's blown his whistle it was a late flag on the far side. Yeah havertz had just made his movement Too early, but I don't mind that you know japan pressing The germans high up the pitch havertz was actually on side there. That was a poor decision The assistant waited and waited gonda just gets there before havertz, but that would have been an opportunity for the germans That's the voice of chris satan on bbc radio five live musyala back to rudiger in the In the center circle and because of meida goes all the way back to to manuel noyer What is his seventh major final his fourth at a world cup? member In to 2010 all those years ago back in uh in south africa As there's a blow to the head there of musyala and that will mean there is a stoppage in play and japan are going to make another change so we've already seen Tomi yasu come on at at halftime for japan and now we are going to have metoma who's done well for brighton and hobalbin he uh Has had a little bit of illness. That's the reason why maybe didn't start the game. So he's going to be coming on And also we're going to be seeing asano. So these are Two positive changes that are being made Nagatomo is the player who is going to be coming off And meida is the other player who is going to be coming off. So asano will go on in place of meida the Celtic player and then i would imagine that Brighton's caru metoma Will fill in on that left hand side as a as a left wing back But changes that need to happen to try and produce something and straight away asano Involved out towards ito right hand side a good cross into asano throws himself at it near side of the six yard box Headed out of play for for a goal kick Yeah, lively start from asano just pops it out wide and there's a good early cross in Asano had made his run beyond the near post Never with the point of the six yard box and couldn't get his head up on target, but this is better from japan Not letting the germans Have it all the wrong way really pressing them high up the pitch not backing off Surprised they didn't take this tactic in the first half So he has gone over on there hasn't it is like for like for metoma to replace Nagatomo is the the left wing back He's uh, he's one of pat nevin's new favorite players metoma when he's seen him in fact before he actually seen a bit bright and he's uh He was it on loan at union south san gilware in belgium last year. He's a left winger really has impressed Certainly caught the eye of pat nevin Two goals in his 11 appearances just only a couple of premier league starts though as he's been eased into life in the premier league down on the south coast As japan are hoping that he can make some sort of impression as they look for an equalizer and germany won't be comfortable until they get that insurance of a second goal leading one nil as we approach the hour mark and musyala Just about kept the ball in play on this near side the left left corner of the area As support always from round his cross headed down by tomiyasu can't hold on to the ball those blue shirts of uh of japan and now it is with uh with kimik diagonal ball gun douan Still don't feel though that germany have been stretched yet in this in this contest certainly musyala always a threat has some support It's gun douan and gun douan hits the base of the right hand post beautiful little layoff by musyala I'm gun douan so close to getting a second goal and also increasing germany's lead but denied by the post Yeah, but it's really good build-up play He drifts superbly gun douan. Do you know what he should score? The wonderful touch into his path and he's just trying to Slip the ball inside gondas far post and the ball cannons off the left hand post and wide And the germans should be out of sight Here is gun douan once again midway through the japan half He finds ginavery tries for the cut back almost came back to to ginavery And then it's going to be run out of defense by metoma almost runs himself into some trouble And then he's played the ball out wide towards that far side and tomiyasu Looking now towards metoma who's got a bit of space you run into and all of a sudden it's three against four Germany do have the but it's three against three now and it's now with asano who shoots And noia watches the ball go across his goal and well off target and out for a goal kick Never look comfortable. That's a big chance for japan and that's all it takes Isn't it the germans only one up? metoma pops the ball out left hand side of the box. It's a it's a decent enough first touch from asano, but Just leans back Got to work noia in that situation Gotta hit the target Real lack of conviction with that effort He too plays his football in germany for for bockham Ito right hand side ito's low cross strikes the body of schlotterbeck They're just starting To get a little bit of that wouldn't say a foothold. It's a toe in the game maybe for uh japan. Yeah, but this may suit germany you know hensley flick Happy to go toe to toe as the way managed Munich But japan have to take a risk they need to get back into the game and Yeah, they may feel that they can hurt this german team if the germans aren't clinical Well asano has got a little bit of a little bit of pace musyala just caught by it's a kura That'll be a free kick. We haven't had a yellow card in the uh contest so far and the salvo d'orion referee Ivan Barton will not show one on this occasion. It's just a friendly Gentle talking to to the japanese defender So clever isn't he musyala? On that half turn has that awareness just out of the corner of his eye You'll see it's easy to kura coming to try and nick the ball off him in front of him. Let's run across his body Takes it on the back foot draws the foul So Look very very sharp that is for sure here is gun douan on the halfway line nice Almost coming to a standstill now gun douan. So there's no pressure on the ball whatsoever from japan I've got every player back behind the ball Towards rudiger short diagonal ball to gun douan kimmick and then played back to schlotterbeck And as christ mentioned at times it looks like they are playing with three central defenders That's going to be offside against havers terrible run from havers. I mean blindish Goes so early just needs to bend his run a little bit more It's not It's not a natural in that number nine position. It's a bit of a problem area Well, the german team had some Brilliant center forwards over the years me and the germans. Yeah more of a Big bulky types closer beerhoff Maybe what they're lacking Yeah, well the lad who scored on his debut Nicholas fulcrum has certainly had an impressive season so far for beferre de bremen second half substitute against oh man scored on his debut such an important game for the germans that wasn't it? Don't you start Kelly sending me messages as well taking the mickey laid off by itu forward ball by tomiyasu and Asano won't get there rudiger came across And snuffed out the danger. He had been a doubt. He hadn't played Up until last thursday their own warm-up game for japan and since the 10th of september with a right knee problem For takumo asano that the the bockham striker Is rapid and certainly he showed his pace there, but rudiger was equal to it. Germany's still lead by a goal to nil here little touch played out on this right hand side for for sakai But it's offside. It'll be a free kick to to germany Do you think the germans could get a little bit nervous at one nil do germans get nervous Ian Well, they're gonna freshen things up. I know that for a fact. They're gonna make a couple of changes themselves Garetsk is gonna be coming on and we are also going to be seeing Jonas hoffman Who's gonna be coming on back? That's right He uh Will be coming on to the field of play Complain defense or midfield Jonas hoffman. So the german supporters on the far side who are now trying to whip up another mexican way But uh, I've just been so disappointed with japan They might still get something from the game. There's 25 minutes remaining. Let's see what happens trailing by a goal to nil sakai plays it back Because it's a central area mitomo Now with tenaka tomiyasu Along the ground asano turn shoots gets a corner kick as well better. Yeah, you said about Japan getting a foothold in this game. They're taking the game to germany Feel their confidence may just be growing You need to try and create something clear cup I don't get this. They have to play it short. They may score direct from a header, but the germans are Just so much bigger Corner kick for japan swung over deep and the header from it's a kura at the far side of the penalty area It was unmarked and it was headed away by schlotterbeck pulled in behind musyala, didn't he? He's hit to beyond the the far post and musyala not not looking at the ball Just looking at it's a kura. It's a kura tries to go back across does the right thing, but it was schlotterbeck Slotting that header away Well, you talked before about the german center forwards who've gone before Uh miraslav closer the famous geert moeller jürgen klinsmann. They've scored Only more goals than thomas moeller for germanic world cup finals, but moeller unable to add to his tally of 10 So he has come off to be replaced by urus hoffman And then the other change is gundogan like for like really gundogan being replaced by gretzka By munich in the the midfield so two changes made by germany And we're midway through the second half here on bbc radio five live and bbc sounds And it's still germany leading through that gundogan first half penalty remember by the way as well when you're watching games on bbc television I mean five live and bbc sounds have every game But when it's on bbc tv you can watch and listen With a five live commentary you just have to look out for the world cup extra on the bbc i player It gives you that option Yeah, gretzka's just slotted in behind kymik Sakai's head forward asano in towards the penalty area Took it first time tightly marked by rudiger comes behind him asano has made a difference since he's come onto the field of play kornikin kajipan He has made a difference, but you've got to say The japanese have been much better in this second half this own shown more intent and rudiger does really well, but Ball headed from sakai into asano angle against him rudiger stands up and makes the block but confidence growing Tachi kamada with a corner kick it's an out swing the right hand side It's akura was there once again and it's scooped up by noia Just wouldn't really drop towards the central defender as it's rolled out underarm towards sulla And he trots forward and still at a walking pace with kymik to schlotterbeck Still don't feel that germany have really got out of first gear throughout this game No, but you said before they want that Second goal they've had pretty much control of this game. You can see the japanese pushing now and Really getting off to germany middle of the park 2018 was only the second time in germany's illustrious world cup history that they had Not reach the quarterfinals 1938 was the other occasion. This is their 20th World cup appearance only the second team to reach such a landmark after brazil They are serial challenges musy ala Central position kymik with a chip over ganabri with a layoff good save by the goalkeeper To keep out hoffman Still the german threat remains ganabri shot curling beaten away by gondor once more musy ala now picks it up left hand side round Runs forward down towards the byline with the cross in the area Gondor again with a save from ganabri and a second save from gondor And can every can't believe it great work by gondor golden work by gondor goal kick corner kick great work by gondor Great four saves in quick succession. It's a brilliant ball from kymik Initially ganabri really unselfish pops the ball back to hoffman gondor down to his left hand side Then they recycle the ball gondor again down to his right hand side this time Ball comes out musy ala pops at a wide round with the crossing Powerful header left hand side again big left hand and then he body on the line No crucial could those saves be from gondor the great I thought you were going to say gondor the wonder Corner kick for germany. He needs to be alert still leading by a golden ill right hand side Over the head of schlotterbeck over the head of rudiger and out it goes Full eighth row to germany on this near side. There is activity on the Japan bench down below They still have two more opportunities to make further changes does their coach mori asu As it's with round back it goes to to schlotterbeck I Said last night. I mean I'm sick and tired of the amount of these substitutions. That's really hard work. Isn't it being a Well co commentator the hard work comes when they then add on about 13 minutes as a result of three substitutions Germany still lead by a golden ill We have 18 minutes remaining There we go They're livening up the japanese team now Must be a foul from goretska I think there was talk wasn't it before the game about Gunduin ended up with the goal past gonder but goretska whether it be goretska or gunduin Doan came on to replace tenaka in the midfield so yet it's another player who plays in uh in germany 24 year old normie plays on the right for uh for fryberg Who've actually done well there were second in the bundesliga before the the world cup break So they've made a number of changes now to try and get this equalizer in the second half Here is the endo forward opportunity for japan watch a save from goretska and then it comes out And I think it might have been Was it tom yasser who's put it over the top from close range? What a save from noya the concentration levels must be so great. He's had nothing to do throughout the game It's a one-handed save But the loose ball should have been buried Well, it's a brilliant save It was sakai Yeah sakai, but it's the initial save actually takes a deflection Of rudegas left foot and then sakai I think Osana's in his way maybe but sakai should have buried that balloons of all over the bar That was the chance that japan needed and they didn't take it Can they carve out another opportunity? You just wonder if there's going to be A dramatic finish here to the caliph or international stadium when you think of the heroics the double save From suichi gonder at one end and then japan still being in the contest So this is going to be their final change that they they can make for japan And it is minamino the former Liverpool player who has come on And it is sakai who has gone off he had been playing as a right wing back He had that golden chance to get the equalizer And he will be ruined that missed opportunity. He's been consoled as he makes his way to the bench. What if What if Hiroki sakai had scored from close range there So ito who temporarily moved to the left is back to the right try to play in dohan block. All of a sudden now japan are starting to Have a few options as an attacking team Matoma left hand side runs forward edge of the area minamino is there good save Japan have got the equalizer it's a substitute dohan And there is the twist in the tail with 15 minutes remaining It's the substitute who combined And ritsu dohan who plays in football in germany has equalized against germany one one And what have we learned in the last few minutes japan can play Brave on the ball becoming desperate the longer the game has gone on taking risks Played the way beautifully up the pitch worked it down the left hand side brilliantly The Noia Makes a decent save initially With his left hand, but With the save he pushes it out into an area and dohan is so alone He can't really miss but he's proactive Falls for him six seven yards out just lifts the ball into the roof of the net japan level japan back in it japan can play Well, certainly Moriatsu the coach has been vindicated with the changes that he's made All three substitutes or three of the substitutes involved Matoma of brighton minamino shot was then pushed out by noia And then ritsu dohan with the equalizing goal And here in the calipha international stadium in the opening game in groupie Germany have been pegged back by japan We saw how they gave belgium a scare at the last world cup On that occasion It was japan who squandered a two-goal lead and belgium fought back on this occasion It's japan who's shown the resilience and the character to get themselves back on level terms And you go back to those saves those four saves from gondar In quick succession But isn't it amazing now the urgency with which japan are playing the intensity which they're playing But can the Germans Respond and get themselves back in front. Good average to kimmick Dispossessed by matoma who will run forward over on that far side And matoma is over the halfway line for japan. He's got some support going through the middle With asano The ball though he'll hang on to it on that left hand side Germany Who hit that post through gun dohan on the hour mark? That was a chance for the insurance goal. They were unable to take it As now dohan lifts the ball forward towards Minimima on that far side matomo They're waiting to make a double change our Germany goods is going to be coming on all of a sudden it's minimino into the penalty area once again an out for a goal kick Tell you what they've rattled aren't they the Germans? They really are Japan got that confidence Popping the ball about and they look the more likely team Well, this is a little bit of a fairy tale for mario gutza Scored the winning goal at the World cup in 2010 making his return after five years So mario gutza Back involved on the world cup stage. He probably didn't think that was likely to to happen and Nicholas fulcrum Who's a little bit of a throwback, isn't he in terms of a of a burly center forward of berda bremen comes on so fulcrum replaces havertz and gutza Has come on for musy ala who was unable For all the promise that he's shown To get a goal ganabre is now playing on the left hand side and here is ganabre and we've got Just over 10 minutes remaining and germany now. I've got a corner kick Yeah, if you were to pick a winner now Ian, who would you pick? Come on I would say it's gonna finish one one That's a massive Defensive there doesn't it? Who has the momentum japan have the momentum that germany have a corner? It's kimik to take it Kimik With a corner kick on the left hand side over the head should you say of course it was gutza who scored the winning goal in the 2014 world cup final He was 18 years of age when he was selected for the world cup in 2010 But it still caps a remarkable return for him doesn't it now he's playing with eintracht frankfurt Absolutely doesn't can he find the finishing touch for the germans this evening Good group this isn't it really is This was the one I was fascinated with and slightly worried I actually predicted a japan win Against germany Didn't show any real quality in the first half, but showing the quality now what a ball that is falling through towards ito It was played out from the back by it's a corner and noia had to be alert Nine minutes remain of normal time Very in line we had four minutes of stoppage time in the first half when there was no substitutions And we've had one two three We've had at least seven in the second half Not including the tommy ass who won at half time. We could have about 10 minutes of added on time. Is anybody's guess one one Really good piece of combination play down that right hand side the enormous Sula and hoffman clever little one two hoffman And shaped it hit the crossing he's gone behind for a corner to germany Fancy them from set plays in the germans Full crook is there slaughter back up from the back Rudiger also full crook makes a run towards the near side of the six yard post germany and their white shirts or Predominantly white shirts and black shorts Corner kick far side the right and it goes headed out by ito Headed further away by a sarno on the edge of the area Sula heads it out wide to this near side for round who plays it down the line good. So lets it come across his body and It'll go out for a germany throw that round level the area wants to take One one on bbc radio five live and also available on bbc sounds As there there was a challenge from slaughter back And that was on endo and it goes out of play for a throw to japan and just another lull within the stadium now Maybe a lull before the the final surge From both teams, but the lull doesn't do justice to the finish that we have actually have got no One one and chances at both ends the atmosphere doesn't do the finish Justice lovely touch by asano into the penalty area asano Oh my word What a sting in the tail But what a touch high ball downfield asano killed it dead right footed and then Rifle the ball past noya And germany now are facing back to back defeats in a world cup for the first time since 78 and 82 They were humiliated in russia and now they face embarrassment by losing another game in the opening match Here in goha, but what a touch what a finish what a story Yeah, what dreadful defending from the germans i'm not so sure it was a free kick Anyway, it's just one ball which does for the germans asano gets the wrong side of schlodderbeck drives into the box And then lifts the ball into the roof of the the angle against him noya nowhere What a comeback they parked the bus in the first half the handbrake off in the second half and japan in front He looks on side. They are looking I think for an offside, but I think he was played on but it was the high ball What a touch what a what a first touch? Unbelievable first touch takes him on the inside of schlodderbeck has a little look He's still got a lot to do noya makes himself big But asano into the roof of the net stunning finish Well, well, well They finished behind saudi arabia in their qualifying group But the asian sides are producing the shocks saudi arabia yesterday japan Today both coming from behind It wasn't a key feature at all. It didn't happen in the in the last euros last year teams didn't come from behind To win games in the group stages germany now looking for a riposte And it comes in creek kick touch out go for a court great ball in from ramp wisdom Bit of urgency now from the germans Kimmy going over to take the corner. I don't know whether it did come off the japanese head japanese claiming as a goal kick This is the third team that has come from behind the previous two Have won as the cross comes in on that far side with the at the corner kick Challenge on the edge of the area good. So was there hammered away by yashida It's it's anywhere we'll do now I saw it yesterday saudi arabia come from behind to beat argentina france came from behind to beat australia But when you when you saw the japanese displaying the first half, I mean it's incredible We don't want to knight and do so yet game of two halves, but I've I've seen enough. I mean upper Celtic tatty Kiyoko good technical players and you're thinking You know if they can't get in this squad they must have some players. We know the likes of comarda The super talented, but they've just shown a bit of belief got on the ball played And cut through the germans easily in this second half They lulled germany into a false sense of security Although to be fair to germany kunduan had the chance you think back to that excellent double save from gondobut Then we did say we wonder if it there might be a change even then When they were just starting to get going, but the changes have been perfect from moriatsu And maybe maybe it was the perfect plan from moriatsu This is how he saw it Working out change of formation at halftime. They have been better at the groaning belief and what have you got germany? Germany unable to break off for the shackles of that embarrassment in russia four years ago And in a difficult group they would then be under real pressure with games to come against spain on sunday and then costa rica Next thursday the first of december Germany who are always there or there about when it comes to The last knockings of a world cup for every decade germany have been in the top three in a world cup the 30s the 50s the 60s The 70s the 80s the 90s 2000 and 2010 But the start of 2020 they were leading by a golton ill and now they are trailing by two goals to one You're just seeing the asana goal again. It was suhler on the far side the german right back who was playing him on Clever run, but one long ball the german line not good enough What a moment Has made such a difference goes down under the challenge of a penalty there It was the sanna who laid it off into the path of doan who got the equalizer and doan went down There are booze and whistles inside the califa stadium. They think that should have been a penalty I I think my first impression was simulation from doan It'll be being checked Mori esu and his dark suit is walking down the touchline. Here we go Plays back and away. It has been checked and it must have been dismissed To onto japan He's better than that doan is don't do it doan Germany looking for an equalizer in the closing stages kimmick to rudiger Every outfield player in the japan half aware as they germany play from right to left Japan defending deep hoffman touched it to sulla the right back inside now towards kimmick Sula won't get too further forward. I wouldn't have thought with the but but but then They actually don't look like they're good enough at this moment in time to play through the japanese They look shell shocked don't they? Well, the one player who did was musy aula who's come off the field of play as hansi flick Messed up with his substitutions You seven Lukaku is coming on now the baratio dauntlin player And he has replaced Canabri So these full crook with an opportunity from across with the header. He's that's a difficult header. He's 13 14 yards out And heads the ball level with the penalty spot heads the ball past gondas left hand post I know you dismissed the oman warm-up game last week but Lukaku certainly wouldn't dismiss it because he actually became the youngest player to make his Germany debut since ube sailor back in 1954 When he appeared against oman last week and the amount of stoppage time isn't as great as I was expecting Seven minutes, which we're now into seven minutes of stoppage time of Germany one Japan two live on five live And bbc sounds and the nature of bbc sounds you can rewind it So if you've missed that japan goal Then if you want to listen to chris Sutton laughing again at the german demise Then do so once again disrespectful. I know but listen back to it through bbc sounds You're better than that Here is kimmich my wife's part german come on. You're better than that Germany will hope that they're better than that as they try and get themselves back on level terms You said that they had an advantage because of that game that friendly game against oman who at rank 75th in the world Hoffman out towards suhla Hoffman Can't get past matoma far side the right germany get a throw level the penalty area the first minute of seven has Inlapped I think is it Tommy yasu is down and this this Bumpy cramp. He has had a yeah a calf issue But I think by my calculations they have used all of their substitutions Because obviously to me yes, who came on at the start of the second half they then had the two asano and matoma But this is that's a good shout actually the but he's just got to hang on in there If it is a calf injury then I'm not a medical expert, but you know, he's unlikely There's a tear or whatever he's unlikely to play again in this tournament. So better off seeing this through winning the game worrying about that after plenty of Support for japan that was a loose ball in the back from suhla seized upon by Asano who waits for the supporting run of of dohan on this near right hand side Level with the german penalty area plays it on the inside endo tried to thread it through to minamino Germany get it out of their defense hoffman But the whilst japan's substitutions have worked to a positive effect. Yep Germany just seems to have lost a lot of their rhythm Since their substitutions have been made they now go along up towards fulcrum heads it on mukoku picks it up on this near left hand side delivers a low ball in It might fall here to goretska. They won the penalty the germans Matoma took it off the toes of goretska who was trying to shape to shoot full full crook Asking for a penalty wonder whether they're checking this Yoshida is having a word with the salvedorian referee Never look wow. I don't think they can give that it's yoshida Full crook Shoulder to shoulder i'd be really surprised if this is given play back underway Didn't really have too much of a look at that Three and a half minutes of the seven to go japan still lead by two goals to one round such a threat in the second half Ito doing his job there stop the cross the germans got some big guys in there Throw that round will go back to schlotterbeck neuer is up in the center circle incidentally Rudiger he's going to shoot from distance and he's pulled it well well by nice That's a goal kick ridiculous from rudiger Tries to ping that in from 30 yards And now gondar What a game he's had he did give away the penalty, but those saves succession of four saves He'll be gone to the great back in japan We have under three minutes remaining Gondar the player who chris Sutton's just been talking about Downfield out it goes for a germany throw Spain Costa Rica belgium canada to come But this will be the story on day four of the world cup you would think Germany go long full kruge attack sit first time hit just why Running onto it was goretzka right footed Struck it on the half folly, but it must have been half yard wide of the left hand post Yes, a straight ball into full kruge. This is his game. This is what he's good at. He just Peels away from the centre half little knock down goretzka Onto it is unlucky On the half folly laces the ball is not far away Gondar taking his time It's nearly it long ball up the pitch 78 they lost to austria in argentina They opened up the world cup in 82 where they lost to algeria That was the last time that germany lost back-to-back matches In the world cup Oh no, he has that his goal again no, yeah out of his penalty area this time to try and prevent asano from getting there He feeds it forward to schlotterbeck launches the ball long Hoffman jumps in the air right corner of the penalty area And it runs out of play. It's a japan throw. Yeah, rudiger is going up As a center forward the germans have gone wimbledon style Just launching it into the box What a victory this would be for for japan if they can hold on What a victory it is for the continent of asia as well For saudi arabia yesterday to trump argentina from coming from behind. I don't think that's a foul Rudiger goes down easily Noia's going forward. What happens next? We know what happens next history could be repeating itself It's a free kick to germany. We have 30 seconds remaining of stoppage time no, he's up from the back Japan have every blue shirt back inside the penalty area japan have come from behind they lead by two goals to one Now or never you would think for dimanshaft They have the free kick on the right hand side Minimino just one in the wall Noia currently at a march adjusting his socks his yellow socks all in yellow Stands out quite brightly as we look towards the penalty area by my watch the seven minutes are over This might be it for germany to try and salvage something In it comes now from the free kick noia throws himself at it comes out towards suhla He's gonna stay up. He was inches away from hitting that in noia last touch of a japanese defender Sula wins the corner Noia couldn't get on the end of it. There's a player down. Might be two players down Inside the six yard box He's not far away is he is was he yeshe do just gets a touch noia would have been in The japanese bench celebrate They're still got work to do of the minimum of seven we're now Eight minutes in of injury time germany looking for a dramatic equalizer kimmick with a corner in swinger put a shout by gondor Hoffman almost on the halfway line plays it out towards the right hand side Noia is now going back towards the penalty area germany get a throw for the salvor salvador in referee blows his whistle japan celebrates And germany if you think back to 2018 That was their first opening game defeat since 1982 And they have now suffered back-to-back losses at the start of two successive world cups They were leading they hit the post they couldn't get the second goal Gondor was great in the japan defense and then came the substitutes with two goals In the space of eight minutes to give japan a famous win two-one What a strange world cup What a strange game a game of two halves japan not it in the first half Germany get in front you think second half they're controlling it should have been game over you're right about the About the gondos saves and then all of a sudden japan get the confidence they show they can play Doan good substitution pops up with a goal and then Asterna brilliant goal brilliant finish Lift the ball into the roof of the net pass Noia and then the Germans got desperate. I thought handsy flicks substitutions were pretty woeful really They went direct at the end But japan held out and this group I said before the game really interesting group spain germany costa rica and japan And japan have made their mark now and the Germans have worked to do Flicks first major tournament ends in failure Japan they're all smiles down below. What a score line. What a story. It's finished germany one japan two
