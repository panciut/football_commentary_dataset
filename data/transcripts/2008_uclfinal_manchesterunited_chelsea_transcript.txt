 It's going to be a really big moment for English Premier League stand and those teams I always feel sorry for them at this stage because the banners and badges of Manchester United and Chelsea are unfailed in the centre stage in the centre of the pitch they're just waiting to get on with their business. They are the players now just seeing them warm up in the the tonneau just limbering up just shaking those muscles off very very workman like Wayne really a big smile on his face as he's coming out to know that belies a few nerves Ashley Cole and did he a drop right at the back Steely-eyed realizes the value that he has on the Chelsea side but it's a massive massive night for English football back in the day when England and its teams were barred from Europe after the highs all nobody could have thought that this what this scenario would happen the two teams are coming out here they come away to our right Manchester United and Chelsea with an extraordinary scene in front of them here with the balloons about to be let off into the dark Moscow sky ahead of us and they make their way slowly purposefully towards the centre of this pitch it's Rio Ferdinand of course in charge as captain of Manchester United and what a moment to for John Terry as he leads Chelsea out a way to my left is the big wave of welcome from the Manchester United fans the balloons go high up into the sky the 21st of May 2008 Moscow where the English Premier League ruled club Europe but which team what tactics whose talent who will turn things their way tonight Chelsea or Manchester United for BBC sport our team of Graham Taylor Stan Collimore Mike in a matchy football correspondent and first his Alan Green welcome everyone wherever you're listening tonight welcome to another Champions League final on the BBC I say another but it's not quite just another Champions League final is it this arguably is the greatest club game we've ever covered on the corporation because not only is it the greatest club competition the world of Champions League undisputed in that role but we have two English finals and if there is just a little point to what might happen the two previous occasions in 2000 and 2003 when we could change from the same nation competing in the final Real Madrid against Valencia in 2000 AC Milan against Juventus in 2003 that one was at Old Trafford each time it was the team finishing lower in the league that won the Champions League so is that an omen for Chelsea the anthem that marvelous anthem concludes the players will be nervous they can't wait to get on with it we've had that silly opening ceremony which is purely for the benefit of television and means absolutely nothing to the fans inside the ground but towards ever thus the two two lineups first of all Manchester United the goalkeeper is van der Zijk then the defenders Brian Ferdinand Vittic and Everett in midfield Hargreaves Skolls Carrick then Ronaldo Rune and Tevez not quite sure what order that's got to form in midfield and attack but we'll know pretty soon after they kick off Chelsea's lineup and formation is very familiar goalkeeper is Czech defense Esián Carvalho Terry and Cole McAleley holding in midfield with Balak and Lampard pushing forward then Cole and Maluda in the wide positions and Drogba through the middle Esián at right back Graham Taylor I think it was always going to be is it ever since he's been moved back there to make sure you can accommodate both Balak and Lampard I think it was always on I think like many people we would prefer to see him in midfield because that's where he's powerfully comes on but I can well understand him leaving the team as it is because he is capable of still coming forward from that right back position the referee no favorite of Chelsea's Liverswick Hill from Slovakia according to Jose Mourinho he awarded a ghost goal at Anfield in that famous champions league semi-final meeting between Liverpool and Chelsea Garcia officially scored it Chelsea remain convinced to this day that the ball never crossed the line Chelsea's players not quite in the huddle but they're all embracing at the moment Manchester United's Ronaldo is wandering amongst his colleagues shaking hands Michael Carrick's doing exactly the same thing it looks as if United in the red shirts white shorts and white socks will kick off this 2008 Champions League final ridiculously kicking off of course at a quarter to 11 in the evening in Moscow so it will finish officially on the Thursday Chelsea all in blue the referee takes the signals from his two linesman and the scenery blows the whistle the synodos clouds will feel better we're underway and immediately all hard games is playing down the right side of the midfield in fact the ball is played towards hard greaves it goes beyond them and behind for a goal kick now that was the official lineup that you eat the game out in their pre-match information but it's not always reliable but that's where he is straight away he's come out onto that right flank and you therefore say both Rudi and Tevis now are playing as two forwards and Manchester United are playing a 4-4 two-match formation with Ronaldo on the left hand side which puts Ronaldo up against Essie and of course goal kick taken by Czech here's Lampard hooking it on to Drogba back towards Lampard but didn't get the pass right hard greaves picked it up then he was tackle and the balls out of play in fact it's gone behind for a goal kick I thought initially they'd gone out for a throw in that no it'll give an early touch for van de Zij well it all shows what you know what we all know we're all talking about we can't see that midfield being anything but the three of them in there we didn't think that hard greaves would come and play in a wide position but that is exactly what has happened he's well capable of doing that hard greaves here is hard greaves heading the goal kick on collected by Rooney Rooney miscontrols the ball it's taken off him by John Terry and then snap forward by Balak Drogba does well playing it to the left hand side and here's Maluda over the halfway line into the United half tackled and beaten by hard greaves and Maluda was tugging at the England players shirt so he could see the freekick to Manchester United straightforward decision for the referee there and the freekick taken by Ferdinand here's Paul Scholes Scholes to Evera on the far side of the field on that or another and Ronaldo is brought down by Essie now that was a meaty challenge by the Ghanaian freekick awarded of course Scholes takes it to Ronaldo again back to Scholes Ronaldo collects 15 yards over the halfway line a couple of fancy stepovers then he lays it on towards Evera Evera got past the marker and good tackle there given from Joe Cole putting it out for a throw it yeah lively start I mean although the game has only been playing a couple of minutes or so Manchester United look really up for it and they're moving the ball about well Manchester United attacking the end to our right in the first half that's the end behind which the Chelsea fans are they don't make best use of that throwing Drogba winning the ball in the air than he was far I think by Vidditch yes it's a freekicks a few scruffy freekicks awarded by the referee who's undoubtedly one of the best in Europe very good I think Alan is one of the points Vidditch will have to decide should he go in and challenge for that ball on Drogba or sometimes just let him have it here's Drogba playing it on towards Joe Cole it's knocked away to safety by Vidditch and here's where's Brian the right fullback from Manchester United champions of the Premier League in England yet again second success of season Brian on towards Hargreaves Hargreaves definitely filed as Nicole just barged into the England colleague and it's a freekick to Chelsea hasn't done yet at all no it just needs to but as I say Manchester United really look up for the game as well and coming out with his 4-4-2 formation you know it gives them that feeling let's be very positive about things there certainly aren't empty seats in this Mickey a rating particularly at the Chelsea and there was one Chelsea charter flight that was cancelled and 200 fans with tickets never got anywhere near Russia but their teams on the attack now lampart onto Maluda left of the United penalty gets a good cross in headed away well by Vidditch further clear by Carrick then Maluda picks it up again on to his left foot lower cross this time bounces towards Ferdinand and he hooks it high and out and out it comes off Maluda's head is it right for throwing no it's not he's Hargreaves from Manchester United to Carrick. Carrick hits it in the half way line Terry intercepts launches the ball forward straight through to Van Dazaar. There's a good cross by Maluda earlier there from a standing position he was able to whip it in fortunately for Manchester United I think it was further than what he's had to it. You're listening to BBC radio Manchester United 0 Chelsea 0 Sculls leaves it for the captain tonight of United real Ferdinand gigs is amongst those on the bench and I'm told that United would lift the trophy and gigs is on at the end of the game then gigs and Ferdinand will both lift it. Chelsea will wish to deny them that that honour Sculls drives the ball towards the left side taking on the chest by Ronaldo but he can't keep it in play and it's a throw in to Chelsea. Just little things like that don't you don't often see Paul Sculls get that kind of long raking diagonal pass wrong slightly over hit it there. Very bitty in the opening five minutes of the game. Another nephron and goal so far Chelsea waste the throw in Vidditch slaps it back to van der Zarr. Drogba recently comes towards the Dutchman so van der Zarr carries the clearance to the left side and Vidditch again Vidditch used to play in the stadium for Sportac Moscow. Vidditch hits it over hits the ball and it scurries behind for a goalkeeper to Chelsea and I'm just noticing what a lurid orange a goalkeeping outfit Peter Checkers dot on. The bright orange there is no missing him at all. Now we'll spot him. We'll spot him. There were five in his play. Nell Nill, Manchester United and Chelsea contesting the first ever All-English Champions League final. Here's Michael Ailey hitting the ball towards Ashley Cole intercepted by Hargreaves he started brightly for the champions of England. Hargreaves crosses the ball takes the reflection and check momentarily I thought lost his footing there but did enough to get back and catch the cross. Yeah as Hargreaves looked to put his cross in it came off Ashley Cole and deflected towards the corner of the Chelsea goal and just a little bit of a heartbeat there when Peter Check just slipped but eventually collected it quite comfortably. It's probably too early to see how this pitch is holding up Graham. I mean it looks okay we are far distance away but I know that the English Grimesman who was responsible for laying it wasn't happy with the outcome. I think he's had quite a few problems really getting them to follow what he thought. He wants to do it's not his fault it's getting getting the authorities to let him do what he wanted. Here's Balak a hardy in the game at the moment but getting the ball to Lampard who exchanges passes with Michael Ailey. Lampard then looking for Drogba who'd pulled away from Ferdinand but Ferdinand gets his head to that cross and clears it then Malouda snaps it back into ward Drogba flags up for offside. Drogba in an offside position there initially wasn't going to get involved when he chose to do so flag goes up straight away. Nearly seven minutes gone and relatively uneventful minutes here in the Luzhniky Stadium in Moscow. A reminder of the time which is eight minutes to eleven in the evening. Here's Scoles to Brian on the half way line hard by the right touch line on to Tevez. I think that was Tevez first time. Back to Brian. Ferdinand again. I know Graham Taylor is expecting great things of Carlos Tevez tonight. Rooney good header to Tevez. Tevez sort of inside right channel back to Scoles. Scoles not a carrot in the centre circle. Ronaldo drops deep picks up the pass. Ronaldo turns a one-two with Rooney. Ronaldo again good play heading the pass to the right side. Here's Hargreaves whips the cross in. Oh good important vital intercepting header by Terry. Rooney was ready to direct that cross into the net with his head. Excellent cross from Hargreaves. We know he can do that when he was playing it right back. Quite right jump Terry got a vital header there. Here's Hargreaves again and Hargreaves wins the throw in off Ashley Cole. Ash I didn't see videotape of the incident but I gather the McAleley challenge on Cole in training last night was not clever. There must have been a slight doubt about Ashley Cole but he's here starting and throwing for United taken by Brian to Tevez. Tevez can't get it back to Brian. It's clicked on by Ashley Cole. Maluda doesn't give it a play and it's yet another Manchester United throw it. The game not yet settled down. No it's a real rhythm but I still think Manchester United are ready. Here's Hargreaves from the throwing by Brian. Hargreaves now cutting in field towards the fennelge. This time crosses left footed high towards Ronaldo. Ronaldo must have half thought of a left foot volley and then distracted by his lack of proper thinking couldn't control the ball and it's behind for another goal kick. You don't often see that a long raking cross from Owen Hargreaves into Ronaldo who completely missed the ball railing. It ran out for a goal kick. Very rare you see miscontrol from Ronaldo. A drug will want something. I've just a drink of water. Can't be dehydrated. A swig and he'll feel a lot better. I don't think television audiences around the world will be in throw about what they've seen in the first five minutes. It's been a little dull and scrappy. Here's Drogba playing the ball to the left side but ahead of Maluda and the ball didn't run truly there. It was bumping along the surface. Brian got across with the interception and puts it out for a throw in which Ashley Cole will take. Ten yards in the corner flag of the United half. Chelsea left. Throw goes to Lampard and Lampard's pass intended from Maluda. Hit Karak and Ricochet's off his knee out of play. I'm told that Drogba actually cut his tongue in a collision with Vittic. That's why I needed a swig of water. Macalailing. No, it's to Esi. Where Esi had popped up from right back in central midfield there. Lampard for a pass from him behind Ashley Cole and straight out of play. He just got caught there as Ashley Cole came up on. He needed to pass it first time. Once that didn't happen, stuttering on the ball didn't get his pass accurate. Ten minutes played and we haven't had an effort on goal yet. Nothing even remotely near. What's the referee unhappy with? Oh I think he's telling hard reads and Ashley Cole not to pull each other's shirts. You change shirts at the end of the game, lads. Brown with a throw headed back by Ashley Cole and then down by Karak. Skulls fix it on the direction of Rooney intercepted there by Macalailing. Macalailing's pass forward. Met only by Karak and now here's hard reads again. To Tevers. Lovely layoff by the Argentine to Karak. Karak was stretching though and here's Drogba. Drogba almost got passed Birdland. Birdland did really well to get the tackle in and it's ruining for Manchester United. Inside the Chelsea half. Tevers back to Karak. White to the left side and Ronaldo. Ever, sprints forward. Ronaldo takes that as a cue to run in field. Then he needs the pass short for Skulls. Skulls back to Karak. A careful thoughtful play by Manchester United. Karak good pass to the right side in Brown. 11 minutes gone in Moscow. Nail, nail. Brines cross left but it headed away by Hardree's and I think Ronaldo wanted that ball taken under control from his chest and it's behind for a goal. It's been misunderstanding but interesting Alan. The two people in the middle of the goal almost in the D were Ronaldo from the left hand side and Hardree's from the right. Now that's when Manchester United are playing at the best. It's not only when they have the movement to the ball, it's when they have the interchange of positions as well. They're the thoughts of Graham Taylor from England. Manchester stand. Colin was just a couple of seats from the left. I'll bring him in in a moment. But here's Balak to Maluda. A few yards outside the United penalty and the cross was too deep. Well beyond Joe Cole who slipped anyway. Stan, what are your thoughts? Yeah, I mean, free match. We wondered what scenario that United were in terms of their personal on the pitch. Owen Hargreaves actually loved the fact that he's down that right hand side even when he's played as a deep midfield player for England and for Manchester United. He's popped up down the right sometimes and put crosses in so that's a real positive step for Manchester United. Chelsea just can't get the ball up to Drucker at the moment. He's not holding it up. He's trying to play things off one touch. So at the moment, although it's scrappy, Alan, I think that United will be happier. And I know Hargreaves, of course, doesn't usually play this role for England. He shows when he plays wide right from Manchester United, he can do just as well as Beckham, frankly. Well, he certainly gets forward and what he does do when he crosses, he puts pace on the cross. So if he gets it accurately, all that the attacker has got to do is get on the end of it. The pace is already on the ball. He's hoping to throw in here at least force, Ashley Cole to continue to throw in, which is taken by Brian to Hargreaves, who's tackled by Michael Leili. And here's Lampoff onto Drogba. Drogba are flicking it to the left side, but got the direction wrong and it runs harmlessly. The bit of two players are back, the Vandezard. One of these cameras on wires above the playing surface. It looks almost very dodgy to me. It's very heavy, probably isn't. But you wonder, A, if a player's going to smack the ball up, he's going to hit that camera, or B, it might slip its murns and crash down into somebody's head. I'd seen it early and there's no doubt about it. It certainly is lower than the usual one. It is. That is certainly reachable for a long clearance. And the game isn't good. There's no other way of putting it, is it? It's not good at the moment. I think the thing is that neither side has what we call controlled possession of the ball for a period of time. I think that Manchester United have been the better team. I think that they have been more lively, they've been more progressive, they've been more positive. But then again, to be able to control the ball, keep it off the opposition and have what we say is good control possession of the ball. Neither team has yet been able to do that. Well, actually Cole can't be happy with the state of the pitch because he's just changing his boots. Here's Ruhney chasing on the far side of the field. Cavaliere, the old nemesis, knocks it away out of play for a throw-in. Cole's boots are okay. He's back on the pitch, but Manchester United on the attack. Another couple of steps over from Ronaldo. Then a simpler fast back to Scholes. On it goes to Carrick. Carrick in to Hargreaves. He popped up from the right flank in a central attacking role, but the passing move from United Breaks down and he is lamp-fired to the far side in Essie. Essie just curls it down that right flank towards Joe Cole across Cambridge and puts it out for a throw-in. You need a quarter of an hour played, not a header at goal, not a shot on goal, nothing threatening either goalkeeper. Here's Balak who's been very, very quiet so far. Passing it back to Terry. Ashley Cole to Maluda. Ashley Cole again. That's a good ball into Balak. A little bit of room now for the German captain. He suits the ball forward but too far ahead of Joe Cole and it's behind for another goal kick. That's a typical example really. When you have wide players where Joe Cole is and people say they've not been in the game enough, they need service. If they're not getting a service, they can't get into the game unless they go looking and wandering for it. In the present time we've not seen much of a movement by the Chelsea team. There's not a lot in it, but I think Manchester United made the brighter start. Definitely. The first quarter of an hour. Still Manchester United and ill. Chelsea and ill. Champions League coverage of BBC Radio. Drogba rushes forward. Biric was there first. Passes back to van Dizar and the Dutchman clears it over the half way line where Terry beats Hargreaves in the air. But his header runs straight to Paul Scholes and here's Evra. Ronaldo's running down the left flank. Evra tried to pick him out. Great pass. Great control by Ronaldo. Left over the edge of the Chelsea penalty. Beats Essien all too easily and then the cross is very deep. Hargreaves jump, couldn't reach it and I think it's going to go out of play just throwing Chelsea. I think if anything some excellent play by Ronaldo. We've all become used to it. But I think if anything Hargreaves got in too early. If he'd held himself out that little bit and been able to run and attack with our post he possibly would have got on the end of the cross. Ashley Cole with the throw in. Ended Balak. Balak didn't bring the ball under control. Ferdinand clears it into the Chelsea half and then it's headed out of play by Brian for a Chelsea throw in. Well, no need to make any notes yet. I mean Hargreaves playing in the right, that's about it. Stan? Yeah, I think it's quite clever tactically for man United because obviously Owen Hargreaves and Cristiano Ronaldo with Witt are actually stopping Ashley Cole and Mike Lessian. Two of their better attacking wide players from getting beyond the half way line. So pretty much it's Gidea Drogba and one midfield player in the United half. So that's where United are getting all their possession from. Don't think Chelsea have started yet. Here's Ronaldo again on the far side of the field. I said it before the game. His first finnuments might be interesting and he started very brightly with the Portuguese. Fines Everett with the pass. His cross. Ended Rune near post. Terry with the powerful header out of play for the throw in. A good clearance by John Terry. Straight under the ball. Well headed, clear. Manchester United's tempo is very good. Went in possession. You know, oh, there's a mistake. Oh, there must have been a foul there. Free kick to Chelsea. Essie was fouled and what's going on here with Skoles and McAleely. Well, now they must have known that the referee had blown his whistle. I think the referee is going to talk to both McAleely and Skoles. Rune was involved in the earlier incident. But it's a free kick to Chelsea. And a pat on the back from the referee for Wayne Rune. So he couldn't have thought it was any serious evil intent. Where did you get that out, Peter? Check. You don't wear that too often, if you're going to say, well, I'll whistle at you. I'm not going to say. I'm not going to say I agree with this. But from a psychological point of view, there is the feeling when you get a big, bright colour, the instinct is to hit it at it. It picks in your mind. And I'm not saying that I believe that to be true or not, but that is the feeling of some people that if you see something bright, there's an instinct you hit at it. Or now there you are. There's one for you. Or you might just throw up. Well, there's always that possibility. Brown looking for Hargreaves. Hargreaves right side gets in and early cross it quite deliberately by Hargreaves. Hit a Chelsea defender. It was Terry and it loops behind for a corner. Hargreaves and Ronaldo started really well on both players. Yeah, they definitely have. Nearly 19 minutes played in the first half here in Moscow. Manchester United Nail, Chelsea Nail. Needlessly a second ball was thrown onto the pitch. Hargreaves retrieves it, flows it away to safety and he will take the corner. Linesman just checking the balls correctly placed in the quadrant. Tevez quiet so far, come short, but he's ignored. Hargreaves whips the cross towards the far post. Well, Droggba went to meet it, missed it completely and it's going to, maybe it was deliberate from Droggba actually. It's very hard to, yeah, very hard to. No, actually it must have glanced off his head because it's the Manchester United throw. And now there's a fire on Ronaldo and the far side of the field. And that was Droggba or was it McAleigh? It's a long way off. Ronaldo has started brightly. Yeah, I mean when I think back to the game at Stamford Bridge, which Chelsea won 2-1, it's a completely different start. Chelsea haven't started at all. Not at all. In that game, they took the game to Manchester United and took early control of it. But at the present time, Manchester United have certainly started as the brighter team. 20 minutes played here in Moscow. The free kick is very wide. Ronaldo's going to take it. Oh no, he's not taking it actually. Ronaldo's gone into the penalty area and it's Hargreaves who will whip this in. From the United left flight. Played in towards the near post, headed away comfortably by Frank Blampart and here's McAleigh. Heading it on, clattered into by Paul Scholes. That was a bad ball by Scholes. Hello, oh hell yeah. And now Rooney's coaching a Chelsea player away, Ashley Colton. There was no need for that either. When we talked about discipline, the Mark Saggers before the game, we were talking about Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney and from nothing, you know, we had these incidents. All of a sudden, all of the players together again. But Rooney, if he's been picked up there by either the linesman or not, he could be in trouble because he's certainly come in with both hands and pushed a Chelsea player well away. But he's 22 years of age, Wayne Rooney, and really he should have wised up by now. He and Drogba, he and Drogba are exchanging pleasantries or something like that. Scholes seems to have a cut, but it was surely a foul by Paul Scholes. McAleigh is being spoken to by the referee. There's a yellow card out. But it may be. He really adjudged that McAleigh was the guilty party. I don't see it that way at all. There's a yellow card being waved. I think it is to Paul Scholes. To Scholes. Yes, yes. Well, he's got a bleeding nose, but frankly, it was a bad, bad challenge by him. I think it was an actually it was an elbow that caught Paul Scholes. At first, he thought it might have been a clash of heads, but I think Claude McAleigh was leading with his elbow and his court, Port Scholes there. It's a good spot from the referee if he did manage to see that. But I thought it was 6-0-1 and half, it doesn't have another to be fair. Well, Sir Alex is out along with Carlos Quiro. Sir Alex talking to the fourth official. I'm not certain whether McAleigh was not sure at all. But he certainly had his yellow card. I'm not too certain whether he got a call. Well, it's the first incident of note really in the game. That and the cross from Ronaldo a few minutes ago. There ain't a lot else happening. And we've already played 22 minutes. Czech takes the Chelsea free kick. A water for the foul by Paul Scholes. It's headed away by Biric. And Scholes is still off receiving treatment at the moment. Tevez have managed to hold off Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard. Tevez forced a retreat though. Got into trouble. Here's Maluda to Lampard. Brown with a terrible challenge. Good disgrace. What happened there? Ball was played in confusion between Biric and Van Dazaar. And it's put behind for a corner. Yeah, Vigic played it safe there. I think he felt that although Van Dazaar was coming out, he could get his head on the ball. He's not prepared to leave it. Well, Brown was definitely guilty of a foul tackle there. And here's Droga putting Van Dazaar under pressure. I know we've passed the midway point of the first half. But we'll just see out this corner for Chelsea. Lampard to take it from the left side hitting it right footed. Chelsea putting pressure on Van Dazaar. Ball played in Terry Wendermere. It didn't make any contact. And it's behind for a goal kick. And here is my kick. Well, Scholes is still off the field. And it was very, very unclear as to whether the referee also showed a yellow card to McElhaney. But I'm just looking down at a chap in front of us who's got a monitor. He's doing all the stats. And it shows yellow card to McElhaney as well. But that's not official. But I thought, Graham, the stoppage came at a good time for Chelsea because it's broken up a bit of Manchester United tempo. I agree entirely with that. It broke it because Manchester United have certainly been the better team. The game hasn't really settled down into anything constructive yet. Joe Cole, and that's over hit the pass. You're listening to BBC Radio. The Champions League final. Manchester United, Niel, Chelsea, Niel. Scholes having been patched up, comes back on again for Manchester United, who are playing from left to right in this first half. So McElhaney and Scholes now both carrying yellow cards in this final. That's the norm, it seems, these days for Paul Scholes. And now Carlos Tevez finds the aforementioned Scholes, trying to make up for missing the final in 99. Rooney coming deep, finds Ronaldo over on the far side, cross comes Michael Essian. Rooney gives it to Evra. Goes for the return ball, but he won't get it. But certainly tactically so far, Sir Alex Ferguson winning this on points, and Avram Grant has to respond. In all of the preparation, I'm sure Ashley Cole would have been expecting to face Ronaldo. I'm sure Michael Essian wouldn't have been thinking that he would be up against Ronaldo. But that is exactly what's happening just at the moment. Throw into Chelsea over on the far side. Drogba trying to get into the game, and Chelsea win another throw. That's one thing that hasn't happened yet. Drogba certainly hasn't got into the game. Vindicis has competed very well with him when the occasional ball has been played up to Drogba. It will seem very little. Manchester United have the ball back inside their own half, and clearly the ball is not... I don't think rolling naturally at times on this surface here, it's bobbling around on this relay pitch. And Anderson is warming up, I understand. But that's normal, I suppose, with Scholes having just got the injury. But Anderson and Reingigs, at the moment of both, warming up for Manchester United, who have a free kick just inside the Chelsea half, and it's knocked off to Carrick inside the centre circle. Carrick's ball forward to Rooney. Rooney turning away from Maluda. Rooney lays it right to Hargreaves. Carrick's made a run into the area. Hargreaves can't get the cross, and a peel-for-hand ball by the fans there against Ashley Cole. They're throwing these balls on a little too quickly. They've got one on very quickly now for Hargreaves, and West Brown will take the throw for Manchester United. All the Chelsea fans, most of them behind the goal, they're defending. The United fans just making a little more noise at the moment. Brown and Scholes linking up down this near side. Brown with a left-footed ball. Burn! And Cristiano Ronaldo jumps on the ball close, and heads Manchester United into the lead. He talks about Ronaldo needing to deliver on the big stage. There's his response. Manchester United won. Chelsea Nils. Ronaldo's 42nd goal of the season. Well, he's coming completely unmarked. Essy and he's looking at himself. He'll be asking great questions on it. But when the ball comes in, Ronaldo comes in, and he heads it superbly down into the corner net. Pedicic, no chance whatsoever. Excellent header. One nil to Manchester United. I think that's a thoroughly deserved lead. Well, he scores all kinds of goals, Ronaldo. He's a tall player. He's very good in the air. And there is his response to anyone who doubts his ability to take a big game by the scrella of the net. Now Chelsea have to respond. Essy ends balling towards Grogba. It should be a better game now. And in the shot at the end, it's driven in by Michael Balak. It's gone a long way back for a goal kick. Let's get a comment from Stan Collin. Yeah, wonderful cross. Left-footed. Far post. Cristiano Ronaldo. My question was completely flat-footed. It has to be said about far post. And Ronaldo is six-foot plus, not even into the corner. But I think that the problem with Chelsea is is that they've matched up Manchester United. Very, very clever way to play a 4-4-2. Hargreaves is keeping Ashley Cole, put the ping right back. Cristiano Ronaldo with Essy, and the odd man out, Lord McAleigh, who really should be the extra man, is still sitting in front of his defender. So Manchester United, in the key midfield areas, are very good for numbers at the moment, Mike. Well, he's the leading scorer in the Champions League this season. That is his eighth goal. And now can Chelsea find a response here? They'll need to. Scoles for Manchester United. I've been very unkind to West Brown over the years in terms of delivering from the full-back position. And that one was brilliantly waited for Cristiano Ronaldo. Just to give the Chelsea fans some hope here, by the way. The last time we sat in this stadium, the team playing from left to right in the first half scored, first, led at half-time. In the second half, the other team came back to score two. Russia against England. Graham Taylor. Whether that will happen or not, we'll just have to wait and see. But I think in terms of how the game is gone, Manchester United do deserve to have taken that lead. There's not been a fantastic game, there's been a lot of edginess to it, not a lot of good control play, but certainly United have been the more positive and forward-looking side. They've played the better football. Should be a better game now, though, surely, Graham. Hopefully, you know what, this goal will open it up. But Chelsea have to get in, link in together. There's no supply into drug brutal at the moment. He's very isolated. A lot of people were saying 1-0 to Chelsea as a final score here. It's 1-0 to Manchester United. Ronaldo's done the trick once more, leaping up at the far post to head Manchester United into the lead. Chelsea have to get their game going now, but they've again misplaced the pass and Manchester United almost back in business again. Scoles over to the left-hand side. Ronaldo turning on the start, placed the ball down the line to Evera. There's no United player at the moment in the penalty area. Ronaldo again with the confidence and the goal here, just like George Best 40 years ago. Scoles now to this near side, and Manchester United deserve at the moment to be in front. Another ball played in by Brown, headed back in Cavalio clears, and again it was Ronaldo jumping at the far post. For Ronaldo, understandably, he's certainly got the beating of Essie and Nindiair, and there it's a header back across the face of the goal. So that ball, that delivery from either Brown or Hargreaves, it's very dangerous. Of course, the headed goal 40 years ago came from Bobby Charlton in that final against Ben Fieger. Here come Manchester United once more. Rooney hasn't just nicked away from him, and John Terry the Chelsea cap. Look at the gap though, as Chelsea clear towards Drogba, and there's nobody there for Drogba to, even if he gets it, to lay it off to. Joe Cole and Maluda are not in the game, and Avram Grant has to come up with some answers pretty quickly here, and Manchester United now bring the ball out, and Drogba's going down again, looking for attention. Scoles doesn't want to put the ball out of play, but now the referee closes whistle, it's out of play, it's down the line. Claude McAlay doesn't need to be doing that job, because quite simply because Carl Vallejo and Terry are playing against an Orthodox too now in Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez. You've got three with McAlay Lee, he's doing no job whatsoever, because nobody's dropping off into that middle area when United do have a three, Tevez, Rooney and Ronaldo. To pick up Chelsea, you need to commit one more body, either up front or further forward in an advanced midfield position. Well, I think Drogba may recover. This, of course, may well be his last match for Chelsea. There's all sorts of speculation about his future. The Manchester United red and white flags to our left. They're the flags that we see being waved around this Moscow stadium just at the moment, but there's a long way still to go in this final. We played 31 minutes, you're listening to BBC Radio, live from Moscow. It's nearly 20 past 11 in the evening here. The ball is with Wes Brown and Manchester United. Surprise Chelsea, perhaps with the way they started here tonight. Hargris playing very well down the right, doubling up with Wes Brown. Ashley Cole's not getting forward at all. Essian's got his hands full over on the far side against Ronaldo. They really so far, Sir Alex and Carlos Kiros have outfoxed Chelsea. The ball back with Van Dazaar, who really has been unemployed so far in this final. Long clearance towards Ronaldo, looking for his height over on the far side. Takes the ball on the chest and the lovely backflip finds Evra. Skulls, it's all Manchester United just at the moment. Rooney linking with Carrick inside the centre circle. Carrick on to Rooney once more. He looked just down the right-hand side, but he's given it away. John Terry hammers it forward and again there's that big gap between Drogba and anyone else in blue and Manchester United win it back again. And Drogba's unable to be a threat at the moment. And now Rooney trying to find out in Hargris, but it's intercepted by Cavalio. Along the halfway line from Ashley Cole to Balak, who's really been quite anonymous so far. Joe Cole gives the ball back to Essian and now Balak once more. Balak, Chelsea just needing some possession here. They haven't been able to have the ball at all. In goes Wes Brown against Maluda. It was a pretty half-hearted challenge from Maluda and it's back inside the Chelsea half. A little bit of silliness then between mainly Maluda I think and Brown and now Terry. Terry to Maluda. Maluda needs to get into the game here. Ashley Cole for just about the first time inside the Manchester United half. Lampard holds off the challenge from Hargris, floats the ball in towards Drogba. Drogba's headed back, pressure from Balak. Burnham was in trouble and Manchester United eventually clear. It'll be a Chelsea corner. Although some good fortune there and van der Sar did very well to Chlorid away. With Drogba coming round at the back post, headed it back in and then I think it was Balak put great pressure on Ferdinand, not certain who actually got the header in. But if it hadn't been for van der Sar flooring away, flooring it away, that would have definitely been the Chelsea equaliser. Well that was the power of Chelsea. Here comes the corner. Van der Sar manages to palm it away out of the penalty area. Chelsea pick up the loose ball once more. Cavalio has stayed forward following the corner kick. He's got two Manchester United players with him, including his old friend Wayne Rooney. And Rooney's got the better of Cavalio. And now Cavalio's out of the defence as Rooney goes forward and hits it very long and ambitiously to the far side of the field. Ronaldo may get there first. Ronaldo's early ball in at Davis. Great out of Davis. Save, full comes out. Metherbate save from Pettichek to deny this time. Michael Carrick. Oh, thrilling football there by Manchester United. And Pettichek keeping Chelsea in the final. If Chelsea come through to win this final, they'll owe it to Pettichek. Two fantastic saves. The first one from Tevesh. It comes out. And Michael Carrick really does everything that is asked of him. But it's a tremendous save by the Chelsea goalkeeper. What a counterattack that was by Manchester United. Great header from Tevesh. Terrific save from Pettichek. And Michael Carrick looked as if he was going to roll it in for Manchester United. And Pettichek was there again. Corner to Manchester United. Over on the far side of the field. The left of being high balled. Chelsea trying to defend in number. And there was enough pressure there from the Chelsea defenders to make sure nobody in red could get that on target. Well, we may say that the quality of the players such hasn't all improved dramatically. It's still good. But what we have suddenly had, we've had goal mouth incidents. And that generally is what makes a game of football. It creates that excitement. Well, we've talked about the great players on the big stage in these European finals. We remember the likes of Zinedine Zidane, of course, for Real Madrid in particular. And tonight Cristiano Ronaldo, much coveted, of course, by Real Madrid, has headed Manchester United into a deserved lead here in Moscow. Tevesh now giving the ball to Ronaldo. Backflip from Ronaldo. Tevesh, I don't think we'll get that against John Terry, who stays the back pass back to Czech. And Czech just manages to get rid before Runeo bounces. I don't think John Terry was quite aware where Runeo was. And Petr Cech had to get rid of that ball as Runeo came in on him. Throw to Manchester United into Tevesh. Tevesh with a lovely ball square to Hargreaves. Hargreaves into character. There's better movement here from Manchester United. Hargreaves again, wide on the right. Can't get the cross in this time against Ashley Coley. He's looking for a corner kick, but it doesn't reach the corner. It's going to be a throw to Manchester United deep inside the Chelsea half. Manchester United won Chelsea, Nill, BBC Radio, live from Moscow. And that's a goal kick. My theory about Czech's outfit, the orange, was maybe that was in preparation for the penalty shootout. But we may not get that far now, unless Chelsea can respond. Well, there we are. We can't say that actually they hit that orange. He threw himself at it. He's brought up two great saves. World class keeper, of course, Czech, but his team are trailing. And Drogba is looking a little frustrated. But there was a moment to encourage Chelsea when Balak got forward and Ferdinand had a few problems. And now Esián is adjudged to a foul Ronaldo. But Ronaldo is doing it so far in this final for Manchester United. Playing over on that left-hand side of the field and ensuring that Esián, who loves to power forward, can't do it, cannot take the chance. Vittic with a free kick to Manchester United. Into the Chelsea half, Rooney against Terry. They both missed it and it'll drop to Petrček once more. Let's have another word from Stan Kolimov. Stan, how do you see it? Well, that move was delicious, was the word that sprang to my mind. It all came from Ricardo Carvalho, of course, trying to chase the game for Chelsea. Gave it to Wayne Rooney who galloped 40-50 yards and played that wonderful diagonal ball. Really wonderful move all round. And I still think, just looking at the options really, I think that McAley's job is completely redundant there, sitting in front of Terry and Carvalho. Because I keep going back to this point, that Tevez and Wayne Rooney are playing as a two-up front. So why not bring Nicholas and Elcarón, give more of an option with the likes of Frank Lampard getting up in support of two-up front with Drogbab, because at the moment, it's all Manchester United in that killer final third. A lot of danger coming down that left-hand side, as you'd expect from Ronaldo. And we're probably able to see here why Chelsea have already bought themselves a new right back for next season from Porto, the single-up. He'll be playing for them next season, but not tonight, obviously. And now, S&M into Maluda. Maluda turns and shows far too much of the ball to Paul Scholes and United are back in business once more. They have the cohesion so far in this game in midfield. They seem the better prepared at the moment, but still a long, long way to go in this Champions League final. Viddic, United fans sing their songs, and Viddic decides to turn the ball back once more to Edwin van der Sar. There was a big mosaic in red and white away to the left, which spelled out the word, believe before the game. Well, at the moment, those fans, those Manchester United fans, very definitely believe that this is going to be their year. They lead Chelsea by one goal to nil. Can Chelsea respond? They're playing very slowly at the moment, though, Chelsea. They just look to try and get a bit of a foothold here. McAleely to Joe Cole, awkward to control, but he's got it. Balak now pops up down that right-hand side of the field. Skims the ball in with his left foot. Maluda into McAleely. Seems surprised to get that one, McAleely. Lays it off to Terry. Terry now to Ashley Cole. Halfway inside the Manchester United half, but it's a bit pedestrian here from Chelsea. And Terry now almost gets in difficulty, and McAleely helps him out, and now it's moved on to Michael Essian. Essian to the other Michael. Balak into Maluda. What a poor first touch, though, by the Frenchman. And Manchester United looking to another Frenchman, Everett, to clear. He's hit that very quickly, though, back into the Chelsea half, and checks there. First period of controlled play by Chelsea. And it was in the Manchester United half. They need to be doing much, much more of that. Five minutes to go in the first half, and Manchester United lead through yet another Ronaldo goal. John Terry, that's a lovely ball forward to Ashley Cole. Brown has to be careful. And Brown's challenge, well, it wasn't the greatest, but Cole slipped, I think he'd lost possession anyway, and the ball tumbles away for a Manchester United goal kick. I have to say, Mike, I wondered whether Ashley Cole could have just kept his balance. Perhaps I'm being harsh, looking at it again. I just wondered if he could have kept the balance, and he literally got round and chose not to do, and it came to nothing. A referee thought it was a perfectly fair challenge. Stan saying that Drogba's going to need better support, and surely Abram Grant is going to need more from Flora Maluda if he's going to stay in this final for much longer. He's got many options, of course. He's got Calou, he's got a Nelka, he's got Chebchenko. Players who can turn a game. He may need them. Manchester United lead, Chelsea by one goal to nil. On BBC Radio, it's Skoles with a delicate little chip now for Wes Brown. Hargreaves ahead of him down this near side. That's been pretty formidable down the right so far. Hargreaves and Brown. Brown seems happy to have Hargreaves in front of him as well, because he's just going to give him that little bit of extra defensive protection too, and United have a free kick. I think Hargreaves has played extremely well down this right hand side. Not only has he whipped those crosses in, you're quite right. He's protected Wes Brown when necessary. It's a very good decision by Alex Ferguson. Fabio Capello, I'm sure, is making note as well. How well that combination's doing. The all-English combination down the Manchester United right, but it's Portugal's Cristiana Ronaldo. Inevitably, perhaps, who scored the goal here to give United the lead. A header after 26 minutes. Back come Chelsea, and Balak's being allowed to run a long way with the ball. Still Balak, he checks, and then plays it into Joe Cole. Cole, just on the edge of the area, United backing off. It's Balak once more trying to orchestrate something. Slams the ball straight at Carrick. United look to Hargreaves once more to bring it out strongly, and he's got Rooney and Tevez ahead of him. Hargreaves plays it into Rooney. Cavalio comes across. Rooney's only got Tevez in the area. Tries to pick him out! Oh, there's a slip by McAleely, and Tevez almost got there, and it's gone wide. Well, as Akta was knocked in the cross-in, McAleely misses it, came to it. Tevez coming in, just tried to pick it up, so it's so late, but just got the touch on it. If he got the firm touch and seen it all of the way, then that undoubtedly would have been too nilty-united. Just at the moment, all together, two-sharp. Manchester United for Chelsea. The likes of Ronaldo and Rooney and Tevez. And now Michael Balak starting to come into the game just a little more for Chelsea, as he'll need to. It's Claude McAleely. McAleely to Maluda. That's a better touch from Maluda. Lampard in the area! Lampard's gone down in the area, and the offense has been given right outside by Río Ferdinand. The referee gives the free kick to Chelsea. A couple of feet outside. Yellow cards him as well. You know, the referee looked at that and looked at Ferdinand as a deliberate step across. Frank Lampard. And it's right on the edge of the box here. Well, how many times have we seen this over the years? Chelsea have been second best throughout this first half, but as first, as halftime approaches now here in Moscow, this could be an opportunity. This could be a way back into this final for them. This could change the dressing room atmosphere at halftime. Droga and Balak. Remember the fallout between them recently? As to who should take the free kick? This is a couple of feet, no more, outside the penalty area to the left as we look at it. Lampard's talking to both players. Chelsea's Maluda is going into the Manchester United wall. And Van Dessart, who's had to do very little so far, prepares himself away to our left. It's going to be Michael Balak over the ball. And a goal kept to Manchester United. Always had the feeling it was going to be Balak on this occasion. One step, trying to swing it into behind the area that the wall was protecting. Difficult to do on the edge of the box to get it up over such a tall wall and then get it down again. He wasn't able to achieve it. We are approaching halftime here in Russia, in Moscow. Manchester United leading by one goal to nil against Chelsea. When we were here in October, one nil to England at halftime. And it was looking pretty good at that stage for Steve McLaren. Wayne Rooney having scored. Russia sorted themselves out in the second half. And they got the two goals that mattered. In that goal away to our right. And here come Chelsea for perhaps the last time in this first half. Meluda. United don't clear it. Balak and now Essie and drives forward. And Essie and is falling. Hasn't been clear. Will step in and score for Chelsea. Right at the end of the first half. Frank Lampard pops up from nowhere. And what a moment for him emotionally in this Champions League final. After so much sadness for his family. In recent weeks. Right on halftime. Against the run of play. Chelsea equalise here through Frank Lampard. Well, Essie comes in. He has the shot. And it's all about look. Because it comes in and it deflects. And not certain which match of United play to start with. Then it deflects again off Rio Ferdinand. And it drops so invitingly to Frank Lampard. He just puts it away. He just puts it away. You know what is good luck for someone. He's bad luck for another one. And it's certainly the good luck favourite Chelsea then. But they've taken full advantage of it. One-one. And we have played the fall 45 minutes. I have no idea how much added time we're going to get here. But talking about changing dressing room atmospheres at halftime. Having been so much second best here in the first half, Chelsea. Frank Lampard has equalised for them. And look at the effect it's had on them and their supporters now. As Spallack drives one wide. And, well, they're just making an announcement about the added time. Didn't hear it. Two minutes of added time. Stan Collinmore, what have you got to say? Well, Chelsea have taken their little piece of luck. Two deflections. It has to be said, the last one off Rio Ferdinand for Frank Lampard. It's up in. But that's the added bonus of having an attack in midfield. Chelsea just haven't got into those positions all the way through this half. I just wonder if now Abram Grant might decide to stick, keep McAlea as that defensive midfielder, or be bold in the second half, and add somebody like Solomon Clue or Nicholas and Elka. Back on a knife edge. Thank you, Stan. And while all that was happening, a poor challenge by Ricardo Cavallio on his fellow countryman Cristiano Ronaldo. And then there's a few things happening afterwards. And McAlea on a yellow card has to really, really calm down. So Cavallio went right through on Ronaldo there and got a yellow card. So we had four yellow cards, I think now in this first half, Graham. Yes, I mean, the referee has seen it. You can't argue really with whatever he's done. You have to be very careful. It goes into the second half. You can now, you know, feel that tension and feel the tensors, and then see the reactions of the players on the pitch. So one or two players are going to have to be very, very careful. How frustrating it must be for Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlos Kieros as the referee sends them to the dressing room because they got just about everything right in that first half and fully deserved to go in front through Cristiano Ronaldo's header from Wes Brown's ball in. He just had too much at the far post for Ession and Ronaldo duly headed Manchester United in front. And then, and I don't know how important this could be come the end of the day, a couple of fantastic saves from Pedecek to deny Carlos Tevez and Michael Karak. And Chelsea right at the end of the first half, riding their luck, get the equaliser through Frank Lampard. So it's really set us up here for the second half. The halftime score being Manchester United won, Chelsea won. It ain't pretty, but it's the way we like it in the Premier League and that first half in the end, an extraordinary climax with that Chelsea equaliser after never having come to the match at all tonight. I'm Mark Saga, this is five live sport. It's Manchester United won, Chelsea won at halftime. Stan Collimore alongside me. First of all, just a quick overall reflection. Then we'll go through those incidents and in the end there were many in that first half. Yeah, they didn't adapt quickly enough Chelsea for me. Claude McAleigh expecting, I think Manchester United to play a 4-3-3 with him set as the deep midfield to stop the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Tevez and Wayne Rooney as the three. As it turned out, United called the bluff, they went with, oh, in heart, grief, wide first wonderful tactical decision because if you can get up and down, you pen dashly cold back in his left-back position and Cristiano Ronaldo on that left. It effectively, Mark, made Claude McAleigh's position redundant. A lot of times through that first half, Chelsea had five against only Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez. You nearly said it before the start of the game there because Chelsea were out late for their warm-up, whether that was deliberate or not. It made them look as if they weren't at the races and they weren't early on and, with Owen Hargreaves, a wide on the right, there was the tactical change from Fergie, learning so much from that league game when Chelsea battered them early on. There was never going to be that again today. Well, I expected Claude McAleigh as an experienced pro. Don't forget, he's been in an arena like this and he's won the Champions League. Once he realised that he wasn't going to have an attack in midfield or coming up against him, he should have pushed forward 10 yards to give the likes of Balak and Lampard, get them within touching distance, he did the age rugby. As it turned out, Lampard and Balak, for the most part, were a good 40 or 50 yards away and Chelsea just couldn't get out of their own half. What only much happened to Starwood, did it? No, not at all and it was very, very scrappy, but you just thought that United, they had better ball retention, they got the ball into those wide positions and Wes Brown, once he received the ball back from Owen Hargreaves, I think it was, putting a delightful left footed in swinging cross to the far post. Cristiano Ronaldo, yes, is very tricky with the ball at his feet, for his 6'1", 6'2", and very good in the air and caught Michael Essian napping. Yeah, what a header that was as well. I mean, he pierced the goal, the Chelsea goal and Czech was nowhere. The Scholes incident was vital as well, that really brought the game to life there. He got a bloody nose for his clash there with McAlelly, they both were the first two yellow cards of the game. Scholes, you know, he could do that every now and again and then you just suddenly found there was a real edge about the game. Yeah, I think that United basically, two against two in midfield, we were a little bit worried prior to the game whether Chelsea, with that three in midfield, might dominate, put the likes of Paul Scholes and Michael Karik, but actually it's been the other way around. Scholes and Karik have found themselves more often than not in very advanced positions and even when that 50-50 ball, McAlelly and Scholes, it was deep into Chelsea's half. Classic English football there in the counter attack from Manchester United. After what looked as if it was going to be a complete mess up in the United penalty, under no sort of pressure, and then van der Sar had to make a terrific save in the end from Balak's pressure on Rio Ferdinand. It was Ferdinand whose header was goal-bound, it was going to be an own goal, there's no doubt about that. Yeah, it was a wonderful ball diagonal outside the box to do the old drug route, for the first time really got into the game, not in the ball back and it was just under that pressure, like you say, from Michael Balak, came off Rio Ferdinand's forehead and that would have been an own goal. Rooney burst salad defence, just hits an arrow past to Ronaldo, whose pace and confidence, you had to have the pace and confidence of Ronaldo to fetch it and then do what he did with it and two saves from Petticec. We highlighted both goalkeepers, they both showed us exactly why they're as vital as strikers in a game like this. It came from Ricardo Corvalho, he tried to get up as John Terry did once or twice in midway through the half. It gave the ball away just on the right-hand side and Wayne Rooney ran what, fully 50 or 60 yards, got to the halfway line, picked his head up and he saw Cristiano Ronaldo making that wonderful run out to the left-hand side of the 18-yard box. It took one touch to the Portuguese, whipped it hard and low and you thought that was it, goal. Petticec stood up ever so well, Ella Peter Schmeichel in his heyday, ball came back out, Michael carried everything technically well from a midfielders point of view, he didn't panic, he side-footed it with pace, another good save from Petticec, kept them in the game. Talk about the stories as well Stan, I mean the early one was Ronaldo, would he be able to crack it on the biggest stage of all? Yes, Frank Lampard, would he be able to come back? Would the emotion of what's happened to his family and everything else get the better of him as all sorts of talk about whether he's even going to be at Chelsea next season? Yes he would, with that equaliser out of the blue, if I could put it that way, but that's exactly what Chelsea do to all sorts of teams at week in, week out in the Premier League. They look down and out, but they somehow fiddled something and get back in ball. And for the first time for two or three minutes, Michael Essie had just managed to get to the wards of the half-way line, having been penned back into his half by Cristiano Ronaldo, he managed to get well into the United half, got the shot off, two deflections, came to Frank Lampard, it was a gift for him to accept that. One-one-and-half time if you're just joining us here tonight on Five Lives Sport, Chelsea with that late equaliser from Frank Lampard, what's it like in West London outside Stamford Bridge? I swear to goodness you would have been in one already, there's absolutely loads and loads of people just poured on this train. You're looking at the game! Michael, how are you feeling? Oh, we are absolutely fantastic here, it's brilliant, safe by safe by Lampard, what a goal! Because you really, really don't, we are absolutely over the moon, we are celebrating, we are going to win this round. You've got 45 minutes left though. We are going to trouse it now, we have got them. Chelsea, we're going to win this easily. We are going to win. Well, we just think they've won already, I swear to goodness, what a man! Oh, Chelsea! They're really going for it there in West London, what about an old Trafford, Nick Garnett's in the closest pub to the ground. It's very, very quiet here now, it all went very, very quiet just in the last minute, and with Emma and Sean, how do you feel now that that goal's gone in? Really positive still, because we're the better team, we had all the chances, they had one fluky goal at the end, and we're going to win it still, no problem. Ronaldo, Rooney, Giggs is going to come on, because he's my favourite player, Giggs is going to come on and score a winning goal. Sean, they had all that possession in the beginning of the first half, and they got no over that goal, why did it all out? Not really, because Chelsea haven't been a bit of a team by far, they've not been up to scrap, it's not played good. And you reckon that you'll be able to do it in the second half? 3-1, we scored a lot of United. Well, there you go, 3-1 from here, that's the score from the day, say that it's going to be. Belief from Manchester United fans, and belief from Fergie, it may well be his tactical now, so against the better of Avram Graf, we'll talk more on that in a moment, just to tell you though that Giggs and Anderson and Nani are among the substitutes from Manchester United, out on the pitch at half time, no sign of any Chelsea thoughts at all. 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, is the number to ring tonight, 6-0-6 with Alan Green following the conclusion of the Champions League final. You can email him via the Five Live website, or text Alan as well, 85058. We're back where we started, Manchester United won, Chelsea won at half time, full second half commentary to come, on BBC Radio 5 Live. Half time, Manchester United won, Chelsea won Ronaldo with a terrific header from Manchester United, Chelsea really against the run of play, back in it through Frank Lampard, just very quickly, we haven't really mentioned the pitch there, you know, van der Sar slipped, he was in two minds possibly, but his feet went from under him, you know. Yeah, but looking around the box, I think that that would have happened, that was just because it's wet, certainly looking around, the surface looks quite well, and is bearing up considering. Stick or twist, you said, stick or twist, what do the two managers do for the second half? I think for United keep it as it is, I think it's Chelsea that have got the tailoring to United system, I think that they've completely came out of the blocks, and bamboozled Chelsea, like I said, keep going back to this point, but it's so, so relevant, Claude McAleely's job at the moment is redundant, so what do Chelsea do? They put another one up front and try and wrestle back some kind of possession, or stick Solomon Kalu on for McAleely in addition to midfield players. Stan, they're all into the game now, you must have come off big games when you've been battered like that in the first half, and you've perhaps got a lucky break, will Chelsea at half time really come out now? Will we see a different Chelsea side because of what happened just before half time? I think so, because certainly for the first 30-35 minutes, it was all Manchester United, it was interesting towards the end of the half that Cristiano Ronaldo faded a little bit, and certainly Michael Essian came more to the fore, but again, back to square one, will Chelsea keep their system the same? That for me is the big question. Do you think Avram Grant at the moment, we talk about lack of confidence for players on the big occasion, will Avram Grant have the confidence to change it if necessary? He didn't seem to do anything, he nearly froze again after Manchester United took the lead there, looking at the bench. Well, I think you give the responsibility to the players on the pitch, and I know that, like I say, Claude McAleely is a defensive midfield player, but the fact that he was only two or three yards at any one moment from Carve Alliol and John Terry, he as an experienced player needs to address the situation, assess the situation and say, I actually don't need to mark anybody here, the two central defenders are marking Rune and Tevez, I can push forward 15 yards. It was Ronaldo put Manchester United ahead of thoroughly deserved lead, it was Frank Lampard that got Chelsea back into it. What are we going to see at the second half of the Champions League final here in Moscow? Let's find out right now once more with Alan Green. Well, absolutely nothing to commentate on in the first 22 and a half minutes of the game, little of any consequence whatsoever, and then it all burst alike with Ronaldo's goal, that frankly it was the result of a good header with some shoddy defending by Chelsea, Esi and Tupi flat footed, and really Manchester United should be out of sight. The great double save by Czech, but maybe United through Tevez and character of Madrid, didn't get his body or his hand to the ball, and then the great cross by Rune, that I thought Tevez was going to tuck in as well, but he didn't, so Chelsea are very, very fortunate to be level at the start of the second half. I wonder Graham, would you be tempted to just take off Machalely, put on Belletti at right back and move Esi into midfield? I think the thing is when you're looking at that, you look at that first half and you say, listen, we haven't played here, we haven't performed, and listening to what is being said from Stan saying about Machalely, I think what you do now, you've got that goal that suddenly brings you right back into the game. So in one respect, let's have a look for 10 to 15 minutes, and let's see if that goal has such a positive effect on us, and we can then get ourselves really in control of the game. If it doesn't, then he has to make changes. Well, Manchester United are out very early for the start of the second half, there are no changes in their 11, nor would you expect a change. goalkeepers van Dizar, defenders Brian, Ferdinand, Vittic and Evra, we can be certain that the midfield is Hargreaves on the right, Ronaldo on the left, Scoleson carry between them, and up front, Rooney and Tevez. I wonder if this is just a little bit of sneaky thinking by Chelsea. Make United wait. Finally, Maluda comes out onto the pitch. He hasn't done a great deal for me, but Chelsea, as a whole, haven't done a great deal. They have to play better surely in the second half than they did in the first, and we're assuming that they're not going to make any changes as yet. The goalkeeper is Czech, defensive, Eson, Carvalho, Terry, and Ashley Cole, a midfielder, McAlele, Balak and Lampard, then Jocall and Maluda, and finally, Drogba. It's also important, Graham, there are four changes, four changes. Sir Alex Ferguson actually came out behind Drogba, and I think there may have been words from the United boss there about, you know, why are you so late? What do you think, Graham? Yeah, I mean, at the end, the referee will have called them out. The referee will have been in charge of those kind of situation. It may be that he's brought them out of the dressing room. I'm not certain we haven't seen inside there. My whole particular feeling about this is that goal, just before half-time, are we going to see a change of effect? We just have to wait and see. I should tell you, four players were yellow-carded in the first half, Thurdenand and Scholes from Manchester United, Carvalho and McAlele for Chelsea, and there were some techy moments. This referee will not be frightened to send somebody off. The second half is underway. Chelsea all in blue, defending the end to our left, behind which are the Manchester United fans. It's cluttered upfield by Chelsea. Brilliant chest down by Drogba, but Maluda, who's had a poor game, just bollies the ball high over the crossbar. That was hopeful, wasn't it? He was hitting hope there. It's knocked down to him. He's had a swing at it with his right foot. He's never going to score from there. What I also think is Chelsea have got to get into the game to be able to bring Cole, Joe Cole in particular. It's hardly had a kick. Hardly had a touch of the ball. No involvement. Terry had the ball forward, intercepted by Carrick. And here's Brown in the far side of the field. Maluda's foot was high. And is that a free kick? I think it is a free kick. But a foot in from the right touch line, almost on the halfway line. He played to Scholes and back to Ferdinand. And here's Vittic. Vittic from Manchester United. Tereo Ferdinand. And there were two deflections on the way to Lampard's goal. One of them certainly came off Ferdinand. Ferdinand leaves at Neyford's goal, inside the centre circle. First minute on the second half has been played. You listen to BBC radio, Manchester United won, Chelsea won, Evra into Tevez. Back towards Evra. But another example of how this surface is not clever Evra slipped and checkmixed the clearance to the half where he line. Scholes heads it back. Here's Ronaldo, who was caught quite badly by Cavalio late in the first half. Here's Wes Bryant. Hargreaves, who certainly had a very influential first 45 minutes. Maluda barged in soon then. The referee's quite right, Louis Miquel. That's a free kick to Manchester United. You know, I look at Maluda and I cannot understand why his feet was justified. I do not understand what he's doing in the team. I have to say, I think he's been a big disappointment in terms of his performances. They've been very, very inconsistent. Free kick taken by United. Here's Ferdinand on to Vidditch. Quite a slow start to the second half. Oh, poor from Vidditch. And then Scholes was caught by Drogba. And if Drogba hadn't done that, Chelsea would have a great position to counterattack. Anyway, Scholes is going to take the free kick himself. And pedestrian started the second half. Scholes, hit the free kick to the left side. And Evra into Ronaldo. Lampard's close by. Neat backfield by Ronaldo to Evra. And it's Scholes. Scholes looking for the run forward of Hargreaves. Hargreaves almost got to the fourth. Ashley Cole was under pressure but heads it away. And Cole snaps the clearance over the halfway line into the United half. Where it's met by Rio Ferdinand. Lots of empty red seats by quote executives in the far side of the field. We see that too often in England, don't we? But they're the UEFA cats who lick the cream. Balls out of play in the far side of the field. I mean, very interesting how quickly this game just settled down. It hasn't in the second half. No. It's ready for Mike England's commentary, just like the first half. I'm just wasting my time. I should hand over to Mike. I'll set Blatter's here, the president of FIFA. And Michel Pratini, of course, the president of UEFA. Such a great friend of English football, Michel Pratini, as he keeps on making his statements. Here's Lampard towards Romba. Good intercepted by Ferdinand. Ferdinand runs forward. Fines Ronaldo with a pass. Was awkward to the Portuguese and it's out of play. Which way is the throwing going? It's going to Ronaldo and Manchester United. Estian doesn't like the decision. And needlessly another ball boy throws a ball onto the playing surface. Throw in taken. Ronaldo back to Scholes. And Scholes carefully into Carrick. Carrick now to Hargreaves. Hargreaves and Rial to the best United players for me. Here's Bryant. Hargreaves again. And it's to Carrick once more. Four minutes already played in the second half. Not of any great import. Cavalho to Balak. Balak plays it in the direction of Maluda. But Ferdinand's there first. Easily, comfortably. Plays it back to Van Dazaar. Van Dazaar out to Carrick. Carrick now turns and runs away from Balak. Finds Paul Scholes. Scholes to the left side and Ronaldo. Ever the full back. Rushing past the Portuguese. And Ronaldo running forward in quite deliberately. Played it off. Jocall out of play for a throw into United. Ronaldo takes it back to Carrick. Scholes available. Carrick was plaited into there by Jocall. That could be another yellow card. And Jocall waves his hands as if I'm innocent. No you're not. It was late. It was a silly taffle wasn't it? There was no knee. It was always going to give a free kick away. Let's find that very difficult to understand. Because with Manchester United, now so was they can put the ball in the danger area. Free kick taken by Ronaldo to Evera. Back to Ronaldo. On to Evera again. And Balak pushes into Ronaldo. A bit of a dive by Ronaldo. He was fouled but he didn't need to make quite as much of it. Free kick has been awarded. Taken by Evera to Ronaldo. Ronaldo overhits the cross. One bounce in the fennel area. And behind it goes for a goal kick. It really is, you know, which direction you're coming from when you're looking at Ronaldo. Yes he does go down. He went down there probably unnecessarily. But I happen to believe having watched him, you know, a period of time now, he is in line to become a great player. That's all I'm going to say because the word great has to be used carefully. But he's certainly in line to become a great player. Maluda almost got on to that careless header by United. But it's cleared by those in red. Here's Droga. Not much influence in the game but that's a good ball forward to Lampard. Back to Droga. Droga appeals with a handball by Birx there. Not given. Hargreaves rushes away to the far side. They play to safety through United. At least he thought to safety. But it hit actually Cole. Rebounded under Hargreaves. And it goes for Chelsea. Throw it. Six minutes gone in the second half here on TVZ. Champions League final. Still 1-1. Throw taken by Chelsea. Lampard plays it back to Ession. Where's Ession? Inside right position. Schütz deflects off finish. Rekesche runs to Joe Cole. Joe Cole runs it over. Everett did very well. But Cole might get to the ball and Everett plays it off Joe Cole. But Joe Cole furious. He thinks he should have had a corner. Yeah, he's got to be steady. He's ringing out the referee. And now at the ref, now at the linesman. Decision's been made, Joe. You're not careful you'll be in that to... Well, he should have been in the yellow as well. He should have been in the put for that tackle on Carrick. Gold kick is taken short. By Van Dazaar to Viddic. Mike said to me at halftime, you know, Graham. Why you nipped to the little boys of him. He said, don't worry, Alan. You'll get the win. He was obviously feeling guilty. They've had nothing to draw. Comontate on in the first 22 and a half minutes. And I said, oh, no, I won't. And the way the second half has started, there's no chance of me describing the winner. Here's Balak hooking the ball high toward Drogba. Drogba was offside and it's a free kick to Manchester United. Such an untidy start. It is. The game's not settled down this half at all. Free kick played to Scholes under pressure from Balak. Gets it back. Just back to Viddic. Viddic lifts it forward. Joe Cole and the sets to this head. Good header back by Balak to McAleely. McAleely is almost running into trouble, but gets beyond Rooney finds Terry onto McAleely again. Chelsea must be encouraged by being level after being outplayed in the first 45 minutes. Ashley Cole on the far side to McAleely. Lampard again a poor pass from the England player straight out of play and it's a throw into Manchester United. Just for a period of time, we did see Chelsea just trying to link that ball together. Although they didn't end up being totally successful, but they need to do more of that. They haven't kept the ball anything like they should have done, but Credit Manchester United put them in the first half for that. Here's Carvalho with a header towards the United left flank. Kept in play by Evra. Ronaldo available. Ronaldo takes it up. Faced by Michael Balak. Ronaldo cheeses Balak, moves inside. Great play by Ronaldo. Finding Evra. He's a decent cross. Far post too high. Too high for Hargreaves and decided to play for a throw. What a poor cross. You know at this level, great play by Ronaldo. Releases Evra. Time to look up. Players in the box. Pick them in, drive it. Look what you don't do is over hit it and put it out for a throw in. Very, very disappointing end. Well, had it been the other way around, had Evra put Ronaldo through, you'd bet the cross would have been much, much better. Ashley Cole with a throw deep in his own half towards Drogba. Drogba was just leaning back on the defender, but player allowed to continue. Manchester United had possession. Then they lose it. Here's Michael Ailey. That's a good ball forward to Maluda. Now Maluda runs into the centre circle. And Manfrey in the far side. It's Essian. Park from right back. Essian moving forward. Steps in. Left foot, shoots over the crossbar. See what, he just had to get it on target because if you look, Bandasar slipped. He almost went to grounded Bandasar. I thought Essian was trying to bend it into the right post, into the right hand part of the net. He made a complete mess of it. As it happened, if he'd hit the target, I think it would have got in because Bandasar slipped. I think he wanted it really on his right foot, which is better than his left foot. But Bandasar was prone. He wouldn't have got to the ball if it had been on target. Well, that officially focuses my first effort on goal during my commentary in this game. Not that I get needles at this sort of stuff. I just like to commentate on better football. It has been a better game actually since Ronaldo put United in front. And then Lampard equalised. It's hit into the United half, but I think it's running down that far touch line, still in play. Officially, folks, it's midnight in Moscow. Isn't this ridiculous? Absolutely absurd. What are we doing playing football right across the continent of Europe at midnight? Stan Collymore, give me an excuse. Good morning, Alan. Oh, thanks, mate. It is absurd. It's interesting to note, though, that obviously Chelsea's goal came from a miss-it shot by Michael Essien and be mound Maka Leili sitting in that deep midfield position and not being the one to push out. Essien effectively now is playing up. Now we've seen it before. We're a right back come central midfielder. He's making 40-50 yard runs, and every time he gets the ball, Cristiano Ronaldo is really going to have to do a shift to try and pen Essien back now. He's capable of it. Now, Benic had to hit the ball out of play there, and Drover used the opportunity from the resulting Chelsea throw-in to sort of wave his arms at the Chelsea cry, urging encouragement from the club supporters. Here's Lampard after the throw-in. Good ball to actually goal. Just on the left of the penalty. Excellent cross in. Drover was there. So too was Benic. And Benic puts it behind for a corner. Excellent defending by Benic. Had to get down onto the floor to head it. Wide of the goal. Yes, he's conceded a corner, but with Drover bearing down on him, it was first-class defending. Corner to Chelsea. 1-1 in Moscow. Played into the post-drop. Had an opportunity to head it forwards, but caught it awkwardly with his forehead, and it's harmlessly behind. High for a goal. The drug we came in, in and around the near post-aerial, on the edge of the six-yard box there. I'm not certain whether he headed it. It came off his shoulder, but it didn't take full advantage. Five-live at 10 o'clock, assuming a normal finish in this game. We'll have 6-0-6, which I'll be presenting from the Lezhiki Stadium in Moscow. The lines in our open, 0-599-693. Now, here's Michael Ballet. 30 yards, I drive it in, that's a play. I think Van Duzard had it covered. I think Ballet has had more shots than any other Chelsea player in this game. But here he's got the space, he's got the time. You're expecting him to hit the target. You know, and he doesn't. It's well wide. Now, Van Duzard had it covered, but it was a good yard. Nobody closed him down. 12 minutes played in the second half. 11, Manchester United and Chelsea. And questionably United, the better team in the first half. But it's goals that the side matches. However, thought that the equaliser for Chelsea. Here's Tevez, who hasn't quite had the impact in the game that you hoped that he would have. He said two judges to score, and didn't take either of them. Ferdinand heads the ball back to Van Duzard. And Van Duzard out to Ferdinand again, on the far side of the field. On the far side of the field, it seems like a mile away. The stadium's quite shallow in terms of its seating, and we're quite high up. And midway between the halfway line and the goal occupied by Petter Csé. Vittis, that's a good drifted pass to the far side and Brown, who on the volley plays it into Carrick. Scoles available in the centre circle. Carrick though, on to Hargreaves. And now Brown again, to Hargreaves once more. Now, a level with the edge of the Chelsea penalty here. Two defenders across there. One is McAlely. McAlely gets in, a tackle, the balls out of play. Hargreaves has gone down, as if he's injured. And I tell you what, Hargreaves doesn't... He's holding his face again. Remember, Scoles... Well, clearly Hargreaves thinks that McAlely caught him quite deliberately. Scoles had blood from his nose after he made a tackle on McAlely in the first half. Was it a swinging elbow? A little bit, but not much. I don't think any intent whatsoever. No, I didn't think. He did catch him on the side of the game. He caught him. But I think the whole body movement, as you're trying to win the ball, was responsible for that. 59 minutes play in Moscow. 1-1 Manchester United and Chelsea. That check with the Chelsea free kick. And then it's with Maluda on the far side of the field. Maluda to the left of the fennel chair. Back to Lampard. Lampard now into the fennel chair. Lampard tries to cross the ball. It's blocked by Ferdinand and rebounds for a corner. Well, he's taken the corner there by attacking, by being very positive. We've seen Lampard do that on occasions. We've seen him skip past defenders. Wasn't able to do this that time, but got the corner. Chelsea played into the near post. Brilliant defending by Manchester United. That was Vittic. What a wonderful headed clearance. Under pressure. But Chelsea have seen far more of the ball in the second half than they did. At any stage in the first half. On the far side. It's with Maluda. Maluda back to McAleely. And United have got everybody back defending in their own half. Here's Essian. That never mind right back. He's in central midfield at the moment. Holding off Skoles. Feeds the ball to the right. To Joe Cole. And to Essian again. Edge of the fennel chair. Slip there. Was tackled. Ball breaks to Rooney and Rooney. Back in his own penalty area. Bounce the ball upfield. Tebbings is on his own. Mistake by Ashley Cole. Heading the ball straight to the Argentine. There's no support. McAleely gets an attack on. And Chelsea are secure once more. Number of players slipping. And Tebbings there slipped when they had the opportunity to get away from it. I don't know if it's the pitch or actually their footwear. Ballack to Lampard. And it was Lampard pulled down there by Hargreaves. He walls. It's a free kick to Chelsea. And Hargreaves reacted quite badly there. In terms of the way through the ball back to Lampard. A referee decides not to take any stern action. But as I said, it's touchy. You know. I hate to say it but you could have ascending off there easily. Free kick taken. Break ball in. Ashley Cole doesn't pull it back correctly. The lead it was waiting. But here's Ballack to Lampard. Back to Ballack. Into the penalty area. Low cross in. Skips off the head of Perdan. High into the air. Heading away. Estian with a bad challenge. And he knows it on Ronaldo. And that surely will be a yellow card. No, it's not. No, he's not going to give that. Estian knew that he was definitely going to be second best there. Came in. Certainly didn't go in with his feet. But got his body in the way deliberately on Ronaldo. Brought him to the ground. And it was a free kick to Manchester United. Van Dazaar. And it was penalty area to take it. 61 minutes gone here in Moscow. Van Dazaar carefully plays the free kick to the far side of the field. And wears Brian. And Brian hits it from right to left. Aiming it roughly in the direction of Ronaldo. Heading away by Carvalho. Avra kept the ball in play. But good play by Joe Cole. Joe Cole to Balak who's brought down by Tevez. And look, you know, Balak reacted to Tevez. Said something to him. Balak reacted. Not clever. I've got a dodgy head phone connection. And that's why I'm trying to hold that plug in. It's very nice of you to offer as well. Well, such a friend. Anyway, free kick is taken. High towards Joe Cole. Joe Cole tackled though by Ferdinand. And I can switch headphones. Just talk away. There we are then. You've got your headphones so it's silver crisp now. You're just looking at nothing happening in the game, thankfully. So I don't have to make any comment whatsoever. Have you got your headphones back on now? Oh, what did you say? Yeah, there we are. I know, I know. What are you? Hey, listen, mate. We actually have a broadcast line. Do you remember October? Mobile phone for the first 20 minutes. I can remember that. Don't worry. On a quote phone line. Never to be forgotten. United and Chelsea fans tried to urge their team into a commanding position. Neither commands at the moment. It's one goal each here. BBC radio lines open for 606. 0599, 693. Terry and Carvalho hesitate. Rooney almost bars his way through but the fast practice check and the goalkeeper hits it up field. Straight into the United's possession again. Ferdinand back to Van Daza. Van Daza lifts a careful clearance towards this near side of the field. The United left at Everett. Just passing the ball out for the goalkeeper. Excellent play. Here's Ronaldo to Tevez now. 35 yards on goal. Tevez didn't get the fast right to hard greaves at all. Ashley Cole to Maluda, Maluda slips. And here's hard greaves into Ronaldo. Oh, good play by Ronaldo. He has played exceptionally well tonight. Here's Scholes. Scholes. Ronaldo available again but ignored. Pass goes to Carrick instead. Carrick lifts it high towards Rooney. And Rooney's not going to get there. Not going to keep the ball in play. Talking about Christ who made an impact. Rooney hasn't made an impact yet. None at all. It's cleared up field by Chelsea. Droga was filed there by Finish. I think Droga had slipped initially. There was actually no need for Finish to file him in. He got away with that. Definitely. I think in the main visits handled him well but there'll always be the occasion when the fouls are given against the centre back. Particularly, you know, competing against the first and the size of Droga. The centre forward will win the free kicks. Well, if Mike's right, and I'm going to describe a winning goal, it better come in the next three minutes. That's assuming the winner is in normal time. But we might have extra time. So often a feature of European Cup and Champions League finals. And four of the Champions League finals have gone to family shootouts. Maluda left it a freaking, played it well, but clear. That was an outstanding clearance by Michael Carey because if he got a poor touch in that, he could have knocked it into his own net. He had to go for the ball. It was a risk he took by instead of, you know, moving out, putting his foot out to it and you're quite right. Fortunately for him, it came off the right way. If he'd got the deflection, then you couldn't see anything other but an own goal. That's a great piece of defensive work by Michael Carey. Here's Michael Ballak to Lampard. Lampard sees that Ashley Cole's got plenty of room down the far side. Play is midway inside the United half. Ashley Cole to Lampard. Faced by Carey. Lampard still has the ball. Back kills it to Maluda. Maluda left foot shot. Deflects off burden. Everett tries to scoop it clear. Only high and Essians there. Level with the edge of the penalty. Excellent play by Essian. Into Ballak. Lampard shoots. Comes off the head of Vinic and behind it goes for a corner. And Chelsea are getting on top here. They are. As gradually as this half has progressed, Chelsea, I wouldn't say grind their way to it, but gradually have more passing, more of the play, and they're forcing Manchester United back. Another Chelsea corner again from the left side. And again delivered right footed by Lampard. Deeper this time. Van Dessar was nowhere and the header came off. Terry high over the crossbar. I think those were saying before the game that no goalkeeper likes opposition plays right around him. But as you get older that little bit, Van Dessar takes an instant dislike to that. He's always looking at the referee from the word goers, if he's being fouled, which is not always the case. Goal kick taken by Edwin Van Dessar towards Ronaldo. And I think he'll set a playoff, Essian's head. It'll be a throw in to Manchester United. I wonder when Sir Alex will make a change. Because I do expect Ryan Giggs at some stage in the game. And maybe Anderson. Here's Ebra with a throw to Tevez. Tevez hasn't done a great deal. And here's Joe Cole picking it up, running forward. Drucker's in a good position. Cole tried to pick him up with a pass, but I think it ricocheted off Carrick, and it goes behind for another Chelsea corner. Yeah, a little bit of pressure now from Chelsea with the succession of corners. This time it's from the right-hand side. So Mellouda's going to take it. Left footed. Well, Balak's up there. Carvalho's up there. John Terry just pulls his socks up and drug them. All excellent in the air. Mellouda comes. Left footed in swing corner. Doesn't beat the first defender. That was Ronaldo. But the clearance runs harmlessly to Essian. Essian back to McAlele. McAlele on to Balak again. Promising for Chelsea. Dinks it in towards John Terry. Headed away by Ferdinand Limping. Ferdinand's limping quite badly at the moment. He's got a problem. The United Captain is struggling with an injury. Mellouda on to Lampard. Lampard into the penalty. Pills it back. And Ferdinand can hardly limp even as he knocked that ball away. It's still in play and the referee has now blown his whistle so that Real Ferdinand can receive treatment after a word from Grimte. It went midway through the second half. It'll be Mikey. I think that's a correct decision by the referee. It was pretty obvious that Ferdinand was limping. And he'd seen the referee had seen that. And when he had to clear it with his injured leg, he immediately went to floor. Yes, the ball didn't go out of play, but I think the referee was quite right to stop play and bring on the physiotherapist. I just wonder whether it's Kramp-Graham and nothing more serious than that. And of course, it would be desperate for Manchester United to lose their captain at this stage. Stan, let's hear from you. Stan Collinville. Yeah, I think that it is Kramp. The stretches are coming on, but certainly the way it looked was if it wasn't a hamstring. If it was a torn hamstring or a little hamstring strain, he would have been able to move around. Kramp does get you, makes you go to ground quite quickly. And he certainly was in a lot of pain, Rio Ferdinand. But just going back, the left backs, Ashley Cole and Patrice Everett have had really two good opportunities in this half, both of them, to put crosses in when they've been inside the 18-yard box. And instead of going along the route with hard and low across the box, help it, somebody gets a touch in it and scores a goal. It's been poor pass selection. First, Patrice Everett tried to dink it over to the far post. Tore decision and Ashley Cole was saying. Frank Lampard is also receiving some attention as well down there. And I think I said in the first half when there was an injury to Dedier-Drogba that it came at a very good time to Chelsea because they were really up against it. This timeout has actually come at a good time for Manchester United. It is because as this second half has progressed, Chelsea have come more into the game. They've had more control of the ball. They've passed it amongst themselves and kept it for much longer than they were able to do in the first half. And Manchester United, you know, just being gradually moved back. You may not have heard the last commentary tonight from Alan Green because the way things are heading, we are heading for extra time here. Joe Cole, though, takes possession for a Chelsea side, playing much brighter in the second half. Cole makes some room for himself, drives the ball into Woodstrogba. And it's cleared by Manchester United. You just wonder, though, now as we have 20 minutes of normal time to go, whether it might become a little more cagey. The ball is with McElhane of Chelsea, playing from left to right here in this second half. You're listening to BBC Radio. It was all Manchester United in the first half. They led through Ronaldo after 26 minutes. There were other opportunities. Right before halftime, Lampard got a couple of lucky breaks, equalised with Chelsea. And they're such a resilient side, Chelsea. They are a much different proposition in the second half. We've had no substitutions yet. Banderzar clears, Ferdinand's OK now. Tevez won't get that in the air. Rooney picks up the pieces, just on the edge of the area. Wayne Rooney, square ball to Hargreaves on the edge of the area. Hargreaves now to Carrick. Carrick with a shot, didn't get hold of it. He's got a reflection, though. And Manchester United have a corner. Yeah, there. I don't know who is the Chelsea player that's laying down. McElhane. McElhane, he's down. I think it may have come off in for the corner, but he went down very early and he stayed there. Looks like the fissile will be coming on to McElhane before the corner is taken. Well, there's quite a bit for Sir Alex Ferguson and Avram Grant to think about now, because they do have many other options, of course, on the bench. And Sir Alex Ferguson was talking, it was Tevez. And it wasn't a great challenge. Did you see that again? I did, yes. Yeah, what did you think? Well, I thought that Tevez almost jumped on McElhane, isn't it? He was almost like trying to piggyback him, and he's got his hand right round his face. And then McElhane goes down as well. And as I say, the physios are at the moment, and they're treating McElhane while we wait, then for the corner to be taken from Manchester United. Well, Sir Alex Ferguson made quite a lot of the fact that he thinks he's got stronger resources now at Manchester United. And he may well look to the bench, as indeed Avram Grant might have to now, if Claude McElhane can't continue. They're still hoping that he can carry on. And in the meantime, this is a corner for Manchester United. So Chelsea mustn't be distracted by this knock to Claude McElhane. So it will be a corner, and waiting patiently to take it is Owen Hargreaves. Ferdinand and Evera just discussing tactics. From the moment Ferdinand is staying back, Rooney, as ever, in that dangerous area, looking for ricochets on the edge of the box. Ronaldo's headed one goal here tonight. Tévez is standing inside the six-yard area. Corner kick will be taken by Hargreaves to the far post, and Czech was clapping to try and get it, headed away in the end. But I think the free kick might have been given for the foul on Czech. Yeah, I think the referee saw that very early. I think many people there, there'd been a little bit of shoving about people. There's half a dozen Manchester United players up there, same number of Chelsea players as well. And a little bit of shoving had gone, and I think the referee looked at that from the word go. It's getting tense now here in Moscow, way past midnight. As Evera clears, and he hasn't got the ball out of play. Esián keeps it in. Esián now for Joe Cole. Joe Cole's ball travels a long way through the penalty area, and Manchester United now will bring it out. Sir Alex Ferguson stands in the technical area for about the first time tonight, watching his side, carry, turning away from two Chelsea players in midfield, and then very smoothly picks out Ronaldo. Ronaldo now for Manchester United, hugging the touch line and going past Esián. Ronaldo approaching the penalty area, still Ronaldo, red shirts waiting, and then in the end there's nothing. Although I think he's got the corner, he hasn't. Chelsea can't believe it. Joe Cole's furious, but Ronaldo has won the corner. Yeah, it surprised me a little bit there, but the referee's right on the spot, so you can't argue with him, but still two players, Balak and Joe Cole, complaining bitterly that the corner's been given. Sir Alex Ferguson just calls over Evera to speak to him, third in and stays back inside the centre circle. Hargreaves prepares to take a Manchester United corner kick, one-one in the Champions League final, and it's too high for Ronaldo this time. Can't control ahead, runs away for a goal kick. Stan Coddimal. Yeah, just noting there's great skill by Cristiano Ronaldo on the left, where it absolutely, categorically, wasn't a corner. See on the replay, it was a scuff from Cristiano Ronaldo. Referee was behind it, but didn't manage to see that, so he obviously thought it was coming off Joe Cole, but it should have been a goal kick. And the UEFA official down there is inviting Sir Alex Ferguson to step back a couple of inches back into the technical area. Thou's scolls, who's been quite quiet, we don't seem to have mentioned him too many times in the second half. It's Manchester United won Chelsea one in the Champions League final on BBC Radio. Balak, who's been much more involved, much more instrumental in the second half. Throw into Manchester United, and Vidic Schnau for United, back inside his own half. The crowd wondering what comes next here in the final. Ronaldo against Cavalio, and Cavalio, for the second time really tonight, takes out his fellow countryman, the first time he got a yellow card. Free kick is taken, scolls gently with the ball inside the centre circle. United now again finding Ronaldo, just inside the Chelsea half, near side, the left, he's played exclusively down the left tonight. Ronaldo, he's got three Chelsea players around him, he's taking the ball to the dead ball line, but he's tackled by Joe Cole, and Balak thumps the clearance down the field. Again, a big gap between Drogba and the rest of the Chelsea side, and then it's just not back long by scolls to Van der Zyl. I don't know whether it's permanent, Mike, but I think there's been a change by Manchester United. Wayne Rooney out, wide on the right, Hargreaves coming into the middle to make three in the middle, Tevez on his own, centre forward, Ronaldo wide left, I think that is a change that they've made. Something perhaps different for Chelsea to think about, trying to get Rooney perhaps a little more on the ball. The ball is with Essie, and now down the Chelsea right. Plays the ball into McAleely, who's recovered from that blow he got a few moments ago. Balak finding Lampard, and now Lampard, and John Terry coming for the Chelsea captain. Terry's ball, he slips as he plays the ball into the area. Oh, and Drogba got out on the finish, and down goes Maluda! And the referee gives nothing for Chelsea. Well, it's a long way away, that action from here. Maluda went down, and the referee just gives Manchester United the goal kick. Well, I thought Maluda might have handled it. It's certainly not a free kick. The referee completely right, he trips himself up. He trips himself up, yeah. Well, that action, a way to our right, as Ronaldo gives the ball back to Scholes, and Manchester United regroup, and then Viddicke threads it towards Tevez. Graham Taylor just pointing out, then, that Rooney now is over on the right against Ashley Cole. Tevez going to play down the centre. It's very flexible, of course, the front three for Manchester United. And the next goal could win it. Essie in with a Chelsea throw in near side. Manchester United won, Chelsea won on BBC Radio. Into the last 15 minutes of the 90, and now then... Joe Cole... Way off the ball, has gone down. There's... I'm short of the half-way line. There's words between Drogba and the referee, and Everett. I have no idea what happened there. You're not getting a replay. Joe Cole is now up on his feet and talking to pitch... And Alan's right. It's been very techy. There's, yeah. Very niggly, and quite unnecessary. Very, really. Well, what... Joe Cole's thrown himself down. A little bit of right. There was a right elbow for Man, Everett. He just... Well, the referee didn't see it. The officials didn't see it. The game continues, and Didier Drogba now is going forward. Drogba now. Drogba still slips. So many players going to ground here. It's Ashley Cole of Chelsea. Drogba with a shot! It's the post! Van Der Zarr was beaten, and Drogba's effort comes off the post, and Manchester United survive. Van Der Zarr completely beaten then. After slipping, Drogba gets himself open. Immediately, almost within the next step, he's taken the shot in. Bent it round, Van Der Zarr. Smashes against the post. Let off for Manchester United there. Right. Let's emphasise what's happening here. It was Manchester United's first half. It's been Chelsea's second half. And I wonder whether, as Tévez now... There's just too much of this going on. Tévez against Ballak now. And again, niggly, free-kick given. Louis Voschmier-Kell, actually, the referee's been quite lenient here with players on yellow cards, remember, from the first half. I can understand why Sir Alex has changed the formation, because Chelsea were certainly getting a lot more of the ball. But it does worry me when Manchester United do that. It's like an admission that, you know, yeah, we're not quite handling this right, and I still think they're better off doing what they did right from the start of the game by getting their attacking movements going. So I think it steps into favour Chelsea this at the moment. Well, Chelsea equalised against the run of play in the first half. Can Manchester United find a goal against the run of play? Jocoll again against Everett. Ball in the air, headed down by Lampard, helped on by Malouda. But Manchester United patrolling in defence. Ferdinand's header to Van Der Zarr. And now United bringing the ball out, playing from right to left. And they find Wes Brown over on the far side, and now Rooney joining in. But United have given the ball away, and Chelsea sense they could have the advantage here. And Malouda's looking brisk over on the left side. It did drop that! And Droga can't put it away. But Malouda, much more of a threat in the second half, played the ball into the near post, and Droga couldn't control it. I don't know whether to blame the surface or not, I don't know whether the footwear that some of these players have got on. But far too many for me are slipping at vital times, and you could really pay for it. In one respect, I hope it is the problem of the pitch, rather than having your wrong selection of boots on. Carrick of Manchester United, and now Scholes, 10 minutes to go of the normal time here. 1-1 in Moscow. Ronaldo on the ball for Manchester United. Jocoll doubling up to try and help out Michael Essian. Stepovers from Cristiano Ronaldo. Three Manchester United players waiting, and it's headed away easily by Cavalio. At the back for Chelsea. Throw-in. Still no changes made yet by either of the managers here. Aware that the players here could be facing an extra 30 minutes. Throw-in to Manchester United. Evra, who played in the final for Monaco against Porto. Evra throws into Tevez, who really hasn't quite delivered this evening. He may be one of the players who might make way if Manchester United make changes. Now, third inound. Finding Brown down the Manchester United right. Carrick's return ball. Looking for Brown. In comes Ashley Cole, and does well for Chelsea. And it's out of play for a Manchester United throw. We've just moved into the last 10 minutes here. The two goals in the first half. Ronaldo first. Lampard equalising for Chelsea. United at the moment, not moving it quickly. That's normally their game that they love. They love the tempo, the passing and the moving. Big goals now. Bit more height to this near side of the field. Evra cuts it back to Tevez. Tevez fans is a shot, and it's just wide. And I think Pettichek did have that one cut. Yes, I think he did. I just wondered if he'd got a slight deflection, it was. That was not the case. I mean, there's a little chance there for Manchester United. But as I've said, on a number of occasions, I just consume myself when they start to play in a formation that takes away their free-flowing football. If they play this way, they've got to get the ball to their front and wide men. United's first half, Chelsea second. One-one though still. Joe Cole. And now Lampard squirts the ball forward to Essian. Vidditch is there, and he can't give it back to Vandezare. And that just has to settle for a throw in to Chelsea. Now, the throw will be taken by Essian. Essian trying to find Joe Cole. Evra's back and will clear for Manchester United. Still inside their own half. In comes Cavalio. Chelsea have to be careful here, not to be vulnerable to the counter. They've still kept the ball well, though. And it's Terry inside the centre circle, down the centre to Maluda. Maluda sees Drogba in a good position down the left. Lampard's in the area. Drogba trying to set himself up. Bannock shot is high. And took it quickly and didn't control the effort at all. It's gone a long way back. Stan Collin. It's looking at the United bench. They're hurriedly giving instructions. Looks like they're going to be making a substitute. Certain Ryan Geeks is jogging over. First, I thought it might be Jon O'Shea or Darren Fletcher. But Ryan Geeks has been called in. Looks if he may welcome on. And what a moment, of course, it will be for him. It will break the Sebobbi Charlton appearance record. And when he equaled that record, of course, he scored the goal, which finally clinched the title, the Premier League title for Manchester United. Can Geeks make an impact here? About to come on, we think, for Manchester United. Ronaldo boxed in between a couple of Chelsea players, goes to the ground and wins a throw in. Esi and Rolukton to give the ball back. It's, is it a free kick or a throw in? I think he's given the free kick. Something was said from the Chelsea dugout area as Ronaldo kept looking back at them. Carrick chips the ball forward. Rooney's header down. Skoles trying to get their first for Manchester United. And Skoles does get their first for Manchester United. And now Carrick. Awkward ball for Teves to control. Teves played it in and it was scrambled away by Jon Tarris. Before Rooney could move on to it. And Chelsea clear, but they played Joe Cole into trouble, but the referee comes to his rescue. That's quite a confrontation between Joe Cole and Evera for a kick to Chelsea. The game really, at the present time, is really in the balance for me now, because any mistake by any player now could cost them the trophy. So you'll get that coming in and one or two tired legs. Be very interesting if and when the substitutions are made. In Barcelona, United went behind and won the Champions League. Here they went in front and now Chelsea are battling all the way for the victory themselves. And the linesman has given the kick to Chelsea near side. Failed by Viddic. And Maluda's across to take it. And Jon Tarris and Cavalio are quickly forward. Balak has scored some important goals with his head. Lampard lurks on the edge of the area with Joe Cole. So Balak, Terry, Cavalio, Drogba, all in the penalty area. And Maluda will take this kick with his left foot, attacking the goal away to our right with five minutes of normal time to go. Free kick to Chelsea. Maluda scoops it in towards Drogba. Drogba trying to turn, but denied by the Manchester United defenders. And they're appealing for the corner kick, Chelsea. But the linesman has given the goal kick to Manchester United. Well, I'm very clear the goal kick was given pretty well straight away by both the linesman and the referee. So you've got to get on with the play. Big moment in the history of Manchester United about to happen as Ryan Giggs steps forward. Ryan Giggs, Champions League winner with Manchester United in 1999. But the ball is with Chelsea. And it's Balak again for Chelsea. Options left and right. Plays it short to Lampard. Chelsea passing and moving at the moment. Joe Cole, but the ball breaks back again to Viddic. None of the United players in the starting line up tonight started that Champions League final against Bayern Munich. Giggs now about to come on. The next time the ball is out of play. And he may have not only the five minutes that remain, but perhaps an extra 30. Scoles of Manchester United. One-one here in Moscow. Live commentary on BBC Radio. The ball just inside the Chelsea half. And Giggs waits patiently to come on. Ronaldo not quite as effective in the second half. And that was a lazy touch by Ronaldo. Gives possession away very cheaply. It's Lampard now for Chelsea. Lampard to Malouda. Chelsea going to try and finish it off in normal time here. Malouda, skips over the ball. And now McElady finds Lampard. Lampard plays it short to Essie. Chelsea now looking to Malouda again. Malouda tangling with Hargreaves. In steps, Joe Cole. Poor challenge from Hargreaves. Joe Cole's knocked it into Drucker at the near post. And another appeal for a corner kick. And another goal kick. And now here it comes. Here comes Ryan Giggs to come on for Paul Scoles. And make his 759th appearance for Manchester United. And that sets a new club record. Breaking Savadi Charlton's 758th. Wonderful moment in a great career for Ryan Giggs. Yeah, another surprise really. You know, we saw less influence of Paul Scoles as the game has worn on. But it's a fantastic achievement by Ryan Giggs. And what a stage as well to make that appearance in. Here in Moscow, the Champions League final. We have three minutes to go of normal time. Probably a couple of minutes at least of added time. And then the prospect once more of extra time in a Champions League final. Brown into Rooney. And now Ronaldo's gone across into the centre this time. And finds Hargreaves. Hargreaves helps the ball onto Carlos Tevez. Giggs is waiting for a piece of the action on the edge of the area. The ball is with Hargreaves. Rooney trying to stay onside. Goes to Carrick again. A lot of passing here from Manchester United. But Chelsea have got everybody back, apart from Drogba, behind the ball. United just playing it square. And now it's with Brown over on the right. Brown doesn't get the cross in. Instead, hits it back about 20 yards to Carrick. This is patient stuff from Manchester United. But it's not threatening. And they're now back inside their own half. Everon, very cautious, very caging. One moment might settle it. As Carrick threads the ball in and it's an easy catch for Pitterton. Ryan Giggs has come on into a forward position. So it just leaves the two midfield players of Carrick and Hargreaves. I'm pleasing many respects because it means Alex Ferguson hasn't gone against these attacking principles. And he's coming out and they've got much more now into a 4-4-2 formation. Good strong headed clearance there by Brown of Manchester United. Chelsea don't clear it and then Rooney topples over. The free kick is given his way. Not sure he had the ball or... Anyway, the free kick is two Manchester United. Who had just started to have a little more possession in the last few minutes. And now they've got the running of Ryan Giggs, who's just come on from the bench. The free kick is tapped to the far side of the field. It's Brown of Manchester United and that's a high, hasty ball into the penalty area which runs away for a goal kick to Chelsea. Yeah, Wayne Rooney turns around and shows his disgust to Brown there, pointless he said. And it is really, but as I say, you have the four forwards now, Ronaldo, Tevez, Rooney and Giggs. So there's some interchange going on as well, although Ronaldo's basically stayed on the left side. But I much rather see a Manchester United side playing like this. And just to underline for you here with 40 seconds of normal time to go and the prospect of extra time as Ferdinand clatters in against Joe Cole. The game still continues. The linesman have got his flag up there, but now Joe Cole up against Rio Ferdinand and the goal kick is given. I was about to say that it's actually now 25-1 in the morning here. So goodness knows what time we're going to finish. If we have the extra 30 and possibly even penalties. Certainly. I mean, we were talking about this before, what would happen if it went as long as this is not the first time. You remember, we spoke about the Liverpool game against Milan. Two minutes of added time. Two minutes of added time and we're just into those two minutes now. Chelsea have the ball. And how ironic it would be now if Chelsea scored in these last two minutes after everything that happened in Barcelona. Chelsea still yet to make a change. They may have to, of course, add in extra time. Chelsea have the ball and the ball is in towards Joe Cole, but Ferdinand's head was in the way. Chelsea flick it down the left-hand side and away from Ashley Cole. And do you think Graham over the last 10 minutes or so, it has got more cages with approach to the end of the 19th? Yeah, I think at the present time, they're aware of the stage of the game. Nobody will want to commit an error. They'd rather see this go through into extra time and it'll be very interesting to see the approach of either or both sides to that extra time period. And the fans who've been showing their tension, really, and now just revving it up again for their two sides in anticipation, perhaps, of extra time, it's Carlos Tevez. Tevez, one more chance maybe for Manchester United. Ronaldo to Everett, who just about keeps it in. Bit of magic finally from Ronaldo, perhaps here. Ronaldo into the area. McAleady's waiting for it and he's just knocked it straight out of play. And we've got 45 seconds of added time. Ronaldo receives following a United throw. Ronaldo's ball in towards Rooney. Went an awful long way through the six-yard area. Giggs came charging in as well. It's gone wide. It's a goal kick and we've got about 25 seconds to go. Ashley Cole did very well there at the back post. The ball had whipped in. He wasn't quite aware of where I think it was. Giggs was coming, but he had enough nows about him to let that ball go. 10 seconds of added time at the end of the 90 here in Moscow, where it is approaching 20 to 1 in the morning. 1-1 in the Champions League final. It's Michael Caracal, have to be quick. Down the centre towards Tevez, across comes Cavalio. Gets in first. There goes the whistle for the end of 90 minutes. And we've been here before. Almost inevitably, the Champions League final, which was so hard to call anyway between these two, is going to need an extra 30 minutes. The goal so far tonight in the first half, Ronaldo after 26, Lampard approaching half-time equalised. United's first half, Chelsea a thought-shade in the second half. And so we have an extra 30 minutes as a result of 1-1. Ferg is straight into the middle of Manchester United. Now, a long old chat with Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand there. Avron Grant sort of wandering around as he does so with the Chelsea side. It looks to me as if it's the Chelsea side, they're getting more treatment on their legs than Manchester United, who are all standing at the moment, just taking influence. United are on their feet, all the technical staff. They've got people like Jon O'Shea, Darren Fleck, midfield players that can come on. He's noticeable as well in that last 10-15 minutes, Owen Hargreaves, instead of being over on that right-hand side. He took more in as a midfielder when poor sculls came off, just to give them that little bit of solidity, because Chelsea were threatening at times to get within touching distance. Lampard and Ballak shot getting towards the edge of the box. Chelsea, they decided to take the group, sitting down, having a few massages, plenty of water. Avron Grant talking to Michael Ballak, I think it is down there, isn't it, who's getting a few stretches as well. Quite forcefully, he's doing now, going round all of his players. And, well, there's not an awful lot that they could do at this stage. What do you do here? Do you have a little bit of a crack now? And then we go back to the KG stuff for the second half of extra time, or what's that? I think that for Manchester United, it's trying to get ball retention. Chelsea, by far, are the best of it in the final 20-25 minutes or so. And I think that, certainly in this extra period of time now, you'll see likes a drop, but reluctant to go chasing after central defenders, maybe taking a backward step, 10-15 yards, letting them play along the back, Chelsea the same. So it will be very KG. But this is again, when people like Cristiano Ronaldo need to step up in that final third, do his magic. And at the other end, Joe Cole has been at a quiet game, but again, just little glimpses that perhaps he could be potential match winner for Chelsea as well. Well, there's the toss of the coin being made at the moment. We always have quite some time these days after the full-time. We saw Ryan Giggs, obviously, full of purpose going over to the ball now. And very interesting this, isn't it? I mean, we talked all week about the shades of Munich, and 50 years on from that disaster. 40 years on from Wembley, an extra time, when Manchester United, of course, went on so well to win it. Absolutely. Full, really. Chelsea, of course, as well, winning that European Cup, winning this Cup against Real Madrid, 37 years ago, pretty much to the day. All the fans here like to say it's hard to believe, isn't it? 22-1 in the morning. Well, 40 years ago, it was Manchester United against Ben Fika, the side from Portugal. Chelsea don't have a Portuguese manager anymore, but Manchester United may well have a Portuguese match winner. Alan Green. Well, a minute before halftime, I wouldn't have bet anything on extra time. Until that fortunate equaliser for Chelsea, you know, a double ricochet, a ball breaking the lampard, it was all united. All united. Certainly on the evidence of the first half, you thought it isn't going to go into extra time. Yet, having said that, and before a ball was kicked, I don't think coming into extra time has surprised any of us. I think that first 45 minutes certainly thought, well, there'll be no extra time here. But the fact that there is, I don't think is a total surprise. It won't surprise me if it finishes like this, either. And we then have the business of penalties. Ah, well, we're going to have a change. Caloo is coming on, presumably, for Maluda. No, Maluda is there. So what do you reckon is going to happen here? Caloo, seriously coming on. To a particular moment, there's no sign of the change now. Now, look, Caloo stripped off, but the first period of extra time has begun. With the same personnel that ended normal time. In other words, the only change in the game was gigs on for Scoles. Here's Carrick from Manchester United. Back to the Dix that are attacking. The Anto are right in the spirit of extra time. That's the end into which Ronaldo headed them in front. Rooney back to Brian. And now, Ferdinand has become really chilly, but it is 20 when it's tomorrow in the morning. And 6 0 6 will follow on 5 live. Any sensible conclusion here? We're going to get the flight at 7 a.m. So I start walking now to the airport. Well, I think what we're looking at, you may because it started very slowly. Yeah, caution, caution. Very slowly indeed. Well, you know, he's thinking of making the change in extra time. I don't know why he didn't make it the start of extra time. That's how from Grant, Caloo will be coming on. Giggs with the ball upfield, easily cleared by Esi. Hargreaves definitely in a central midfield roll now. To Ronaldo, back to Evra, into Tevez. Tevez, centre of the Chelsea half to Michael Carrick. Carrick slid them all forward to Giggs. Under Tevez, promising. Tevez is there, but so too is checked as they tried to pass the way into the penalty area, pass the way into a goal opportunity. I think they're a little bit unlucky there. I'm not so certain about the Chelsea defender whether his intention was doing intercept or not, but a lovely 1-2 by Rooney and Tevez. Some good play there. Biric, heads checks clearance to the halfway line, then it's headed out by Giggs for a throw, and here comes the Chelsea change. And it is the change I anticipated. I just don't understand why it wasn't made two minutes ago. That is strange, isn't it? It is Malouda who comes off and Caloo goes on. And straight away, of course, Caloo takes up that left attacking position of the sort of two players behind Drogba. Ronaldo attacking down the other flank from Manchester United. And Ronaldo running at Essian. Essian gets in a challenge. I think he may have back healed the ball into Ronaldo, and it's out for a throw into Chelsea. To be fair to Essian then, when Ronaldo started to stretch him with a run, he stuck with him and he's strong and powerful. And I think he's done as well as he could do, playing in the position, which isn't really his natural position. A number of Chelsea players I thought in the second half, came on. Essian did. Joe Cole started to show much more. Frank Lampard, Michael Ballak. But they could hardly play as an athlete in the second half, as they certainly played in the first. One-one here, an extra time here in Moscow. Referee's decided there's an offense against John Terrian. He's awarded a free kick to Chelsea. Just, well, certainly wasn't there, but McElloy takes it and is allowed to take it close to the halfway line. On it goes to Caloo. Brown is there, gets a toe to the ball, it's out of play and it's a throw in to Chelsea. Three minutes of extra time have been played. Ashley Cole to take the throw in. Ballak lurking just outside the penalty here. Cole throws to Caloo. And Caloo into Ashley Cole again, into the penalty here, tries to slide it back, chance for Ballak, Lampard. They all want to shoot. Lampard hit the crossbar. Cole hit the guard up over the crossbar, behind for a goal kick. That's twice Chelsea have hit the woodwork. Well, as much as Chelsea were lucky to equalise just before half-time, Manchester United have been fortunate with first drug-burying normal time. And now Joe Cole hitting the woodwork. I didn't understand why Ballak didn't should have go. And he also actually let the ball to Lampard. Here is Lampard again, in towards drug bar. Drug bar can't pick up possession though and it's played by Vittic. And that's loose from Carrick. And then Ronaldo steps in. Winter ball back. Well done, Cristiano Ronaldo. Sprinting down this near touch line. United right. Onto Rooney. Rooney back to Ronaldo. Running away from McAleely. Is the cross good enough? Into Wolff-Trevbers. Headed clear by Carvalho. Ever on the far side of the field or the referee spotting a foul? By Ryan Giggs. That's a free kick for Chelsea. There's been this talk about Ronaldo having to perform on the big games. He's performing this game, there's no doubt about that. It's a fantastic run. A strong run by him. Good delivery, good end delivery. And he's proving some of the, let's say not critics, but some of the people of question, can he deliver? I think on this particular game he certainly has done. He's being United's best foul. Crockwood also well. Where's the ball on the air? Joke hole, and dies. That's why he didn't get the free kick, joke hole, because it was a dive. It's not just the foreigners who died. England players do it as well. Cole has done it at the moment as if he's injured. I don't know. Play continues. Michael Carrick back to Hargreaves. Hargreaves on to Tevez. They're going to put the ball out of play. They are. Joke hole will receive treatment necessary all the way. I've said this a number of times. I know it puts pressure on the referee. I don't believe it's up to the players to kick the ball out at all. I think the referee must decide when play stops, and then that will cover up all of this business. It ought to be known that it will be the referee that decides when play stops. This is the 14th European Cup or Champions League final. It's gone to extra time. And I repeat, four of the previous 15 Champions League finals required penalty shootouts to decide the winner. Famously in Istanbul, when Liverpool overcame AC Milan, and also back in 2000, I remember Mike and I were sitting at Old Trafford, AC Milan and Juventus. I tell you what, there are a few of the local militia who are donning Manchester United shirts in the crowd. And when the United Goldwoods did, there were four very young girls, clearly Russians, who had sort of steward bibs on, and they went absolutely delirious when Ronaldo headed United right in front of us. Doing their jobs, of course. Right, Joe Cole's okay, back on the pitch, he knew he would be, and United get back possession, admittedly deep inside their own half. Well, that squandered at least a minute of extra time. They'll have to be added on at the end of the first 15. Here's Van Dysart. Van Dysart, right footed. I'm just wondering if it's raining out there now. There are a few brawlies that have been put up. In fact, I'm sure it's raining. Otherwise, it's been a horrible day in Moscow. Gray wet most of the time and increasingly cold. Here's Cavalio Poccelli taking the ball well in his chest. Cavalio trying to run away from Tevez. Tevez did well, got in the challenge, won the ball. Carrick to gigs. Excellent pass to Rooney. And Rooney then tackled by Ashley Cole and Ashley Cole. Rooney was looking for support down the right side, and it wasn't forthcoming. Brome was too deep. Here's Cologne getting away from Brome. This is promising for Chelsea. Essian's in a great position. Play to Michael Essian into the penalty area. Oh, well, it's knocked behind by Carrick for a corner. Essian couldn't really create the room for a shot and goal and didn't think of a pass to a colleague. But I would say Essian there. He's done a 50-yard run to get up into possession. I mean, he's bombing up and down that right-hand side. He's very much almost like the midfield player. Wasn't quite able to get the finishing touch with, but he's still won his side of corner. Lampard from the right. Terry Cavalio and Balak, wait. It's headed down by Cavalio, well wide of goal, and it's trundling behind for a goal kick. Look at this little ritual that John Terry has. Every time there's a corner for his team or a free kick near a goal, he always pulls up his sock. By the way, Nicholas Snellk is coming on. He's replacing Joe Cole. Joe Cole coming off, yeah. Joe Cole. I'm sure he's not into Joe Cole. Just being taken off. Chelsea fans don't like to see Joe Cole taken off. Don't like that. But I wonder if this is a change of formation, and will Anelka just occupy that right-wing berth? And that's where he's going in a moment, away towards the far side. Same formation. So no change in the formation. So they've changed the two players, has Avro Grant behind Drogba. He's taken off Maluda and Joe Cole, and now it's Colou and Anelka. And here is the set of Anelka. Sure, he's not fond of a wide midfield position, but he passes it to Asien onto Anelka. And he tried to run into the defender and went a throw, and he didn't, and it's out for a United throw, which is taken by Terry. And Nani's about to come on from Manchester United. Ball is back with Vande Zarr. Well, we've had a couple of incidents, potential goals in the first bit of extra time. My concern always is when it goes into the second period, they're so nervous, so anxious not to make an error, that we inevitably head for spot kicks. But what we're seeing even with Manchester United at the moment, they're playing very safe football at the moment. Here's Rooney, certainly not playing as a striker, he's wide midfield, back to Ferdinand onto Rooney again. He's on a couple of yards inside the Chelsea half. He hits it high, crossfield, right to left. Asien heads it away before Anelka picking up, but Evera picks it up, great run by Evera. Is this the winner? Oh my goodness, what a chance! What an opportunity for Ryan Ging. John Terry. And shot, hit, I think, an offender, and loops over the crossbar, but Ging should have buried it. Right, absolutely right there. But I think, I don't know whether it's hitting, whether John Terry brought off some great defending, I thought, Alan. I think John Terry got in the way of it, more than Ging's hitting him with the ball. If so, it's fantastic defending. Yeah, but Ging should have scored. Five minutes to go in the first period of extra time. Ging's with the corner left footed. In swinging, great defending, that was by Denier Droga, he was being fouled at the same instant. Vittic was trying to get his head to the ball, and it's a free kick. Here, we're just getting a replay of it. Evera, I don't know, I don't know whether Terry deliberately got his body in the way. He got it away with his head, but it was weak from Ging's. Weak from Ging's. Don't call him. That was top-class defending. He just saved, backstriker's winning downs. Cristiano Ronaldo just seen Ray Bruny come off the nanny. That was world-class defending for him from John Terry. He was on the back foot, he's footing had gone, and he still managed to just prick his neck and get the header over the bar. Wonderful defending for him. Well, former England captain. Well, I don't think Bruny's too pleased to have been taken off, but then he hasn't had the best of evenings, frankly. No, he's not pleasant. And this formation, preferably, of 4-2-3-1, nannies are more appropriate player to be on the field than Bruny. I know Mike was talking before the game, maybe this is Bruny's stage, well, it hasn't proved so. And of course, now he won't be involved in any penalty kicks, should we get that far. And at the moment, we're 19 minutes of football away from penalty kicks. Approaching the end of the first period of extra time. Manchester United won, Chelsea won. Here's Colud, doing well, getting the ball back to Ashley Cole. And into McAleely, over the halfway line. Raric scarce from upfield for McAleely. Pearl pass, awful pass. Straight to Ronaldo, and Ronaldo can counterattack from Manchester United. He's got gigs on Tevez, he finds the Argentine, Carlos Tevez, rolling forward, into the penalty, checked on his right foot, should straighter check. Yeah, once he stepped it back inside on that right foot, I thought he needed to look up because he got support in the box. He went for power straight at him, and didn't really trouble check at all. I thought he could have done better there. Lampard gave McAleely a right roll-on for that error. That could have been very costly. Now Chelsea on the attack now, oh, well played, Colud. I thought he got the throwing, but it's not, goes to Manchester United. Nani, back heel to Hargreaves, and now Carrick, onto Tevez. Tevez on the halfway line, simple little pass, didn't find Ronaldo, and it's taken forward by Esion, though Ripley decides that Esion has fallen. Tevez to get the ball, and it's a free kick to Manchester United. Taken by Hargreaves to Carrick. And now here's Ronaldo again. Tevez is through the middle at the moment for those in red. That's given away by Manchester United, and here's Colud, who gives it away as well to Carrick. Taken up by Nani, done the right flank, a yard in from the touch line. Beats Ashley Cole has to play the ball back though to Carrick. Carrick onto Nani again. That was a hand ball by Ashley Cole, spotter with the linesman, and not given, and then Nani wasted. And now he protests to the referee. I think because it came back to him, they said, look, you've got the advantage. Do something with it. 90 seconds remain of the first period of extra time. Manchester United won, Chelsea won. The lines are open, of course, with 6-0-6, which I'll be presenting into heaven only knows what are here in Russia. 0-500-9-0-9-6-9-3. Check with a goal kick. Vernon jumps the drug, but neither of them make contact. Piddington's there, almost put a possession by Kalu. And then the linesman has flied, I think, for a foot up, was it? It was either foot or fore. He was trying to, you know, his hands went up in the air and probably hit his hands there. Something of that, either way to defend. Still a risk, wasn't it? Yeah, he's a bit sluggish to get there, Piddington. Band is off with a free kick. A minute to go to half time and extra time. He literally beat me, see radio as, well, you should be. Here's Carvalho for Chelsea. A good pass to Kalu. Kalu turns and gets away from Brown again. Back to Lampard. Carvalho. McAleely. Well done, McAleely. Just skips between two United players. Finds Lampard. Lampard to McAleely again. Back to Ashley Cole, the very patient, Chelsea. Not much time left though in the first 15 minutes of extra time. Dink pass in for Ashley Cole. The ballack out. And referee decides that Hargreaves is pulling ballack back. It's a free kick, Chelsea. Yeah, I think he got that right as well. I think he, you know, he's been on the spot, hasn't he, all the time, Blue Bust, Bekel. And I don't think he's got too much wrong at all. Now, he's a candidate to referee the final of the European Championship. Mind you, that double header with this one probably unlikely. Here's Lampard with a free kick from the Chelsea left. Right foot in into the penalty. Skips off the head of Brown. That's a corner. Brown jumped, but it was a tired leap, wasn't it? And we've got two minutes of added time at the end of the first period of extra time. Lampard gets booed by the Manchester United fans as he goes across to take this corner from the right. Now, and Elk is there as well now. Terry played in high and it's Carvalho ahead the time. And if Collou had picked up possession, he should have done, he might have scored. Yeah, I think if Collou had been a little bit closer into the goal, instead of coming away from it, he'd had a much better chance to have got that to the ball as it came bouncing off the ground, bouncing off, he wasn't able to get his foot on the end of it. Well, I know it's three minutes to 10 in the UK. It's three minutes to one o'clock in the morning here in Russia. It is almost Istanbul all over again for Mike and me, but that would mean penalties. Now Manchester United with a throw in deep inside the Chelsea half, into the second minute of added time at the end of the first period of extra time. Level with the edge of the Chelsea penalty thrown by Brian to Hargreaves. They're very cautious now in Manchester United aren't they? No one wants to make an error. Ferdinand to Nani, tackle and fairly challenged and beaten by Ashley Cole. And has played upfield, there was a mistake there by Ferdinand, got away with it. Here's Collou on Collou wasted an opportunity. He had both Anelka and Drogo to his right, tried to run through in his own and didn't get through in his own. Hargreaves for United. Just over the halfway line. Tackled by Lampard, ball breaks out of play and it's a Chelsea throw in. Yeah, I don't know what Hargreaves is doing there. He seemed to dwell on the ball, not being able to find a pass at all. There are a lot of tired players. The pitch has not been great. People are watching in television, they might think it looks okay, but it ain't. And we've had our final seconds of stoppage time, of extra time. And what are your thoughts Graham? Still one one day. Does it become even more cautious? I think it's likely to do that as well. There's always the incidents we've just seen in that period. And it may be that a surprise shot actually gets the winner. We'll just have to wait to see. But generally, and the referee wanting them straight back on as well, generally the second half tend to peter out and it runs out to pedal to us. Well, Ballack's getting a rub down on his right thigh. And there's another Chelsea player lying in his back and might even be John Terry, I think the skipper. But Manchester United, as they get at the end of normal time, generally just standing up, which I think psychologically is a good move. Yeah, no doubt about that. There are a few Chelsea players down, sat down stretching themselves. At the present time, the Manchester United players are there, but they're all being pulled back by the referee to start the second half of extra time. And to describe the second period of extra time, mugging them. Well, I jokingly said this morning, Graham, why don't they just cut straight to the penalty shootout? Because there was always the possibility, I think, that it might come down to this. A whole season of Champions League football. We've got another 15 minutes energy sapping minutes here in the early hours of the morning in Moscow. And if we don't get a breakthrough, then once more it'll go to spot kicks. And Manchester United to restart, Manchester United to restart playing from right to left. And it's Evera. Evera to Carrick on the halfway line. Carrick forward to Tevez. And of course, now they have to be very... They have to think about if they are to make changes, they have to keep their penalty takers out there. Wonder whether we might see Shevchenko coming on if it goes to a penalty shootout. Mixed results, of course, from him in Champions League finals from the spot. Giggs blocked, though, by Essie. And Essie stood up well considering what happened in the first half. And now Anelka, who's hardly been in the game, Anelka now comes forward for Chelsea. And it's a good run from Anelka. He looked for Drogba, but Ferdinand clears. And McAleely and now Lampard. And that ball is sent wide to the far side. And Ashley Cole is galloping onto it. Drogba and Kalu in the area. Ashley Cole cuts the ball back to Lampard. Chelsea, remember, have hit the post twice tonight. And here comes Michael Balak, and that's defended well by Ferdinand of Manchester United. And the whistle's gone over on that far side by the referee. Referee, by the way, like the pitches from Slovakia. And it's a free kick to Manchester United. Yeah, I think, probably, it was Ashley Cole going in with his foot high there, and he's given the free kick to United. But I think he's had a very good game, the referee. It's handled it very well. Quick word from Stan. Yeah, just looking at the pitch, actually. The pitch starts to look quite dark in patches, isn't it? Players not able to keep their foot in. I think that's a very, very brave man to pick the winner out of these two. Well, neither of these sides have particularly good records penalty shootouts. But anyway, let's keep talking it up and maybe it won't happen. It's Viddicke of Manchester United. It's 1-1, extra time being played here. You're listening to BBC Radio, and it's Viddicke of Manchester United. Well, a rather tired ball, but he finds Nani over on the far side of the field. Nani's one of the two United substitutes. Nani, bringing the ball in field, and now Carrick trying to pick a pass here for Manchester United. It's with Ronaldo. Again, the pace is very slow, though, from Manchester United. Hargreaves and Carrick again, but they're all back apart from Druckweber of Chelsea. Giggs, but he can't get the ball past Essian. And McElhagley now gathers it in once more. McElhagley almost caught in possession there, and he was caught as well. Accidentally, I think this time by Patrice Everett. They know each other, of course, from the international side, and it's Chelsea's ball. Yeah, just caught in there. I think that was an accident, and in that respect, and they get on. But it's all slow. Nobody's rushing to take the free kick. I think we'll see this unless a chance suddenly presents itself. I think the game will gradually slow down. And it's Avram Grant at the moment in the technical area. There's Chelsea not the ball forward towards Drogba. Drogba's great power there, but in fact, it's too much power for the referee. Manchester United have the free kick. Fans, Manchester United to our left, Chelsea to our right. Which end, I wonder, would they take the penalties? Clearance by Manchester United, and that's out of play, and it's quite flat at the moment. And the usual routine in these extra times is sometimes they try it on a little bit in the first period, and then as it gets closer and closer towards the end, they just about shut up shot really. And now Vitticte of Manchester United. Vitticte to third now. 1-1. The goals came in the first half. Manchester United on top, in the first half, Chelsea on top in the second. United give the ball away. John Terry's clearance, and free kick is given to Manchester United for the offside. Great clearance by John Terry to deny Manchester United in the first period of extra time. Again, almost at walking pace now. Vitticte finds Carrick, who will shuffle forward and pick out Teves. Dicks in the centre. It hasn't gone off the Chelsea defender, though the United supporters were certainly howling for a corner to goal kick. Yeah, he tried to burst through between two Chelsea defenders. Ball hit him really. Probably came off his knee actually. Goes out for a goal kick. Both teams to a degree understandably looking tired now. There's no really umph about the game at all, so people are just waiting, I think, for this game to run out. Well, in the stadium of course, where Sebastian Koh and Steve Ovec did their stuff in the Olympics here. These two now grinding it out towards the end of this Champions League season. We've played already 20 minutes nearly of the extra time here. The ball is thrown in towards Kalu. Kalu can't control it, and again the whistle's gone, and the game is stopping quite a lot here. It's a Manchester United kick. Yeah, it's almost as if, you know, it's prepared to go to penalties. Now there's going to be a winner, there has to be. That somehow, you know, it could be always very, very disappointing because one person, the goalkeeper can't lose, and one person probably misses that penalty, and he has to live with that for the rest of his life. So, you know, it's the big, big moments. And the two sides can make one more change each if they care to. In goes Kalu to win the ball for Chelsea. And the ball may break here for Anelka. And Anelka going forward, and can it challenge for Manchester United from Viddic, which the referee didn't like. And Viddic goes down with Kramp. But Chelsea have a free kick, and this is not a bad position for them, Graham. It's interesting, Droglicum's across to him, you know, and it's, he sees Viddic has probably got Kramp as well. And he's almost said to him, get up. And when he gets to his feet. Probably even asking him to be guard. He gets the yellow card from the referee. Yeah. Now then. Drogba, this is maybe his scene. Balak's not very far away either. It's about 25 yards away from Vandezar's goal. He's trying to sort the wall out. We are 21 minutes now into extra time here, and it's going to be Didier Drogba, I think. In what, you know, many people are saying could be his farewell appearance, although Michael Balak is still there just to confuse the issue. Cavalio's gone into the area. John Terry's, will he have a blast here, or will he try and put it onto somebody's head? Free kick, and it's Drogba! Just wide, just wide, but Vandezar follows it into the advertising. Yeah, I think Vandezar knew that was going wide. I mean, he got some pace on the shot. It was below crossbar height anyhow, but wide, so Vandezar was quite content to see that go wide. We appear to be heading towards the inevitable here in Moscow. Graham looks at his watch. And it shows that it's about six minutes past one here in the morning. The game kicked off on the 21st, and it's ending on the 22nd, and Manchester United have the ball. As Alan was saying earlier, in the first half it didn't look as if we were, there would be any possibility really, the way United were in charge, of it going this distance. As Cavalio now clears, everybody having to concentrate. Loose header from Viddic, Balak's ball forward. It's ricocheted off Hargreaves, and that's a very good pass from John Terry to send Ashley Cole away down the left-hand side. Cole infield to Drogba. Drogba trying to hold off Ferdinand, but he only presents the ball to Ronaldo. Only Tevez ahead though for Ronaldo. Ronaldo goes past one, two players, and get ups as the referee as he goes down onto Balak's challenge. Referee doesn't give Ronaldo the free kick. Ronaldo now might have a touch of cramp. Tevez has got the ball, I bet he gets back on his feet quickly now though, and Tevez is doing really well inside the centre circle. Tevez finding Nani down the right, and of course Ronaldo's back on his feet again. Nani into the area, Giggs and Nani both, the ball clear to Ronaldo. Ronaldo shot straight at Michael Balak, Michael Carrick. There may be possibilities now for Manchester United. Hargreaves to Evra, lots of red shirts available. Evra's ball in isn't good enough, headed away by Balak, retrieved by Hargreaves. Hargreaves going to the right-hand side to find Wes Brown, and going back to the return. Hargreaves ball in and it's an easy catch for Czech. Just a couple of minutes of some very attacking play by Manchester United, increased the tempo and the pace of it. Difficult for them to do that of course on a regular basis now, and in fact Petr Czech has kicked the ball out of play. Rain falling relentlessly here on an unpleasant evening really in Moscow. More injuries, more cramp and more stancholomy. Obviously now, fluid is it really important, that's where the cramp is coming from. Simple dehydration, and several players, Chelsea players in particular, Ashley Cole, John Terry, Ricardo Carvalho, all taking the time to get stretched those hamstrings, stretch those calves. They've disappointed from both sides to be honest, in the final third, when it's come to whipping balls in. Either hard and low across the ground, or whipping it in the danger area between the penalty spot and the 6-yard box. The delivery has been poor. And after all the early attectiveness of the game by the way, Lampard and Hargreaves there were helping each other out to try and get rid of the cramp. But having said all that, there's a scene developing then over on the far side of the field, with Tevez and Drogba. Narnie I think is trying to keep the pace. Cavalio and McAlea stepping in, and it's just getting a little out of hand here. Oh, Vittic and Drogba. The referee just needs to get everyone away. Now, I don't know what Vittic's problem is, he's shaking his fist at Drogba, and the officials are going in there to help out, the little alliance has dropped his flag, and we're going to have even more time to be played in this game. What's all that about, Graham? I wish I could answer it because it seemed to come out of nothing at all there. Certainly some people, whether Drogba's at it, Vittic, I'm not too certain. I don't think the referee is aware of it. He's got his notebook, he's coming to Balak, he shows the yellow card to Balak. He's having a word with his assistants, with Tevez as well. Oh, a red card to Drogba. But did he aid Drogba? Did he aid Drogba? It's going to be sent off here in the Champions League final, and the yellow card being shown to Carlos Tevez. Well, this is Drogba's last game for Chelsea, this is how he's going to finish, and he can't take a penalty while it was a flap around Vittic's face, and then a push as well on Vittic. Did that merit the red card, Graham? Well, it's hand to face, you can look at it, it might have been more than one to, you can say what we want, we've only just touched him, he's actually slapped him or touched him around the face, and people say, well, you know, he shouldn't do that or, well, he hasn't hurt him. Hey, you don't put your hand up around people's faces, it's as simple as that, I'm afraid. Put it in, Andy's stepping in between Drogba and Vittic, just to make sure there's no more here, Drogba still hasn't left the field here, Stan, what was your view of that? Yeah, it was twice, it was right in front of the referee as well, first of the left hand on Vittic, and then second with a right, just as the referee was coming up within a yard or so. Crazy for him, did he, Drogba, what we've seen out in the room, in 67 minutes or less than that now, and Chelsea are going to have to reshuffle, saw Steve Clark just on the monitor there, turned into going to a four, and, well, could that be the last of the Chelsea, Scherper, did the A-Drogba. And now we have absolutely no idea really how much time we've got left in this game, but surely now the Pendelham turns towards Manchester United again, Graeme. Well, you would think so, wouldn't you, just in there, and yet we've seen so often teams go back, they'll go to a 4-4-1 or something like that, make some difficult to break down, so it doesn't always follow that the team with the 11 people will come on. Ronaldo's been fouled by Esi, and it's been there the whole evening, though, on the surface, bubbling away, hasn't it? Yes, definitely, all the time, all the time. And a yellow card to Esi, and so much for, you know, respect the officials again here tonight. It hasn't kind of looked good, really, around Europe, as Everett, nutmegs the defender, Cavalio steps in, Everett seem to follow through unnecessarily on Cavalio, and it's pretty scruffy and scrappy at the moment. Eight yellow cards and one red, says Alan Green, and so that's the end of Didier Drogba, and I would have thought he was one of the potential penalty-sakers. Definitely, no doubt about that. We hear the United fans over the Chelsea fans just at the moment, and we get a television picture of Romain Kramovich as well here. Wonder, a ruble for his thoughts at the moment, as the Reds have been playing for a while, as forward comes Owen Hargreaves, can Manchester United now seize the initiative, but on the counterattack, it's Calou, there's no Drogba, of course, now. There's no target man to hit. Calou's going forward, and running towards the corner flag, across comes Wes Brown. We'll have to really look to the fourth official here, for guidance on how much time there will be at the end of this, because I make it, we've only got two minutes of the extra time to go, but the game stopped there for a good two minutes during all that. At the moment, we've got Hank, Tane, Catter, and C-Clarke, and Avram Grant, all in the technical area, as the ball is with Edwin van der Sar, who may well be facing another penalty shootout soon in a Champions League final. Ronaldo on to Everett, and that's good defending, strong defending by Michael Essian. Chelsea appeal for the throw-in, and they get it. You know, I know that at the start of the game, Essian would look at himself for the goal that Ronaldo scored, and having Ronaldo run at him, but I think Essian has stuck at his task very, very well, and gone forward. I think he had a very, very good game, Essian. Fourth official just pushing Avram Grant and C-Clarke back, as they show that their frustration down there, and Elka can't hold onto it, hasn't really made a great impact since he came on, and it's going to be Manchester United's throw-in. They have an extra man advantage now, can they make it count? Carrick allows the ball to come on to him, and then finds Tevez, and Tevez forward to Ryan Giggs, who's given offside. Great kick to Chelsea. Yeah, straight in line with it, have to agree with the lines when they're caught offside, but a nice little movement. This is what Manchester United, you know, in the first half, they were doing so well, lost their way in the second half, in their sharp passing movement, weren't able to continue with them in the second half, as Chelsea took control. The weather's awful here now, it really is raining heavily here in the Olympic Stadium in Moscow. Two minutes about it's time we are now facing here and we now enter those two minutes. We are two minutes away from yet another penalty shootout. How important they've become in the modern day. They now do tend to settle so many many big games. This one was always so close to call. It was so hard really to pick a favourite here between these two, and it looks like it is going to go to the lottery of a penalty shootout. Now an Elkas header on, away by Ferdinand of Manchester United. Chelsea now really won't be so ambitious I don't think, without Drogba, united with Narni. They may get one more chance. Narni onto Tevez, Tevez working very hard. He's got gigs available down the centre, gigs with a lovely first touch, still gigs on the area, on the edge of the area, gigs balling with his left foot. Narni tried again and it was great defending by Ashley Cole. And now more players going down in the penalty area. So although we've only got one minute of added time, the game will stop once more and the referee will allow the injured players to be treated. Yeah, he's got crashed by Cole. He's got, as Narni comes in, they collide with the heads, but Narni coming in more powerfully from behind Cole. So both players injured, both players laying down, being treated. And neither of them really moving at all at the moment. And would you imagine, Stan, that over the last 10 days, maybe particularly these two have been practicing penalties? Absolutely, without a doubt. I think that for both sides, they've realised how important it is. You alluded to it, Mike, in European football these days. We all thought that it would be a very, very close game, maybe 1-0, 2-1 either way. And certainly no surprises that it's going to go to penalties. So whoever the five are, of course, did the A-Drogba, maybe 1-1 for Chelsea, maybe even Wayne Rooney as well, from Manchester United. They're certainly not going to be taking them. It'd be interesting to see who lines up in each five. Absolutely certain, of course. Cristiana Ronaldo, the take-one for Manchester United. And absolutely certain, Frank Lampard and Michael Ballak, and probably Nicholas and Nelgrove, I think, will be taking them for Chelsea. I think we've got a minute now to go about it's time. Obviously the game stopped because of the injuries. Ryan Giggs has just been called over now for some final words, final instruction, really, from Sir Alex Ferguson, to see whether United... Remember how late they left it in Barcelona? Narni's got a plaster on his head wound. It was Ashley Cole, who was the Chelsea player who was injured. I think Ashley Cole actually will be a potential penalty taker. Seen him taken, some good ones over the years. Like Anderson's coming on, isn't it? Anderson's coming on. There's no sign of Shevchenko, by the way, coming on. But we think Anderson, who maybe is a designated penalty taker, but they'll have to be quick. We haven't got too long to go as Czech clears, and maybe that's why he is wearing the orange, to try and confuse them all. Now, Evra for Manchester United. One last well-downfield. Ronaldo, that's a tired touch from Ronaldo. Esi and D'Anaisin. Ronaldo to the unmarked, Michael Carrick. Carrick now, swings the ball across to the far side of the field. Narni knocks it in. Terry Stretches doesn't really get it away. Narni again. Still Narni for Manchester United. Ronaldo on the edge of the area. Benzit in towards Tevez, who off-balance, can't control his header. And now if they're going to make the change, they really need to do it now, because we've seconds to go here in Moscow. Yes, the change is being made now. And Chelsea are making one as well. Belletti, not Shevchenko. Belletti for McAlely. And Anderson to come on for Manchester United. No idea at the moment who's coming off to make way for Anderson. So Belletti, who remember made such a huge impact for Barcelona coming on as a substitute against Arsenal in the Champions League final. Belletti comes on, McAlely makes way. And there's some delay here before Anderson comes on for Manchester United. They just can't seem to get the message across here. Or maybe they haven't decided. Alex Ferguson's out there and then signals Wes Brown to come off. So those are the final changes in the game. Yeah, Hargrove's going back to write that walk for the last minute of extra time. But they are, you know, to get the penalty taken on, there's no doubt about that. It is 20 pass one in the morning in Moscow. And the Champions League trophy still waiting to be presented here. John Terry's diving head. That's the end of the final. So Anderson and Belletti have come on, presumably, to be involved in the penalties, which is exactly what we're going to have here now as a result of the final score here being 1-1. And I'm sure you've been with us. And just in case you've recently joined the commentary on BBC Radio, United's first half, they led through Ronaldo. They could have had other opportunities to score. Check made a double save, which was fantastic for Chelsea. Still could be very important. Half-time approaching when Lampard scored, he got a couple of lucky ricochets, and then Chelsea built on that in the second half. They hit the post twice in the game. And so at 1-1 here, we have another penalty shootout. Thank you, Mike Ingram. 0-500-909-693. The lines are open after the presentation of the European Champions League Cup. Dwight of Manchester United or Chelsea after penalties. Alan Green will be with you for a full hour tonight. Whatever time we finish here in the Luzhnitsky Stadium in Moscow. But penalties speak for themselves. Stan Collimore, Didier Dragbo, what on earth was he doing? I mean, that is the bad side of him, and that is why some of those Chelsea fans behind the goal, although they love him as a player, won't be sad to see him go. No, if it is to be his last game in a Chelsea shirt, it's a real ignominious end, isn't it? He walked away down in that corner towards the Chelsea fans, and it was almost like a cricket out for a duck at the MCC. They all turned away, no applause for him. But going back to the penalty shootout, what they've got to do, and I'm sure they've been doing this week, is whoever takes them is to make your mind up before you walk up and stick to it. Don't be fazed by whoever's behind, whichever goal they are shooting at, whoever's obviously the goalkeepers, are going to be there doing their very best to put them off, to move across the line, make your mind up early mark and stick to it. That is the most important thing in penalty taking. Grogbrook of course had the real chance for Chelsea. I mean, a terrific effort. It's not the only thing he's done in the game that much, but he hit the post there. Yeah, very good backlift, very quick. It came to him and he was almost leaning back in exactly what he wanted to do, and in that split second managed to do it. Ball whipped in, came off that left hand post. Frank Lampard, of course. What an ending that would have been if it were a two-goal blast in the Champions League final with the season that he's had. He dug it out and it nearly hit the underside of the bar. I mean, he was so unlucky. I mean, it was sort of after you there, Ballak really set him up, rather he could have had a go himself. Absolutely. Just looking at the statistics, distance covered Manchester United, 139.56 kilometres to Chelsea's 144.93 kilometres, where they get these figures from. But it just gives you an idea how much ground both sides have covered this evening. Well, Chelsea are now in this little huddle. Abram Grant is in the middle of it too. And it's all down to really now a bit of luck, a bit of nerve and a shot on target. Absolutely. Just saying shots on target there. Chelsea had doubled 24 to Manchester United to 12. So Chelsea without a doubt, they've had the best of it in front of goal, but it's still stalemate. And like I say, the players are just walking away now. So in Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Carrick, Nani Anderson, Owen Hargreaves, all there, Viddic, all the players walking over Manchester United. Chelsea still in their huddle, waiting to take those penalties. Plus that little bit of nastiness that we had at the end. They've been a bit niggly all the way through. It's sort of quite similar, I think, obviously to the groundsmen's incident at the end after the warm-down during the league game. You know, they just sort of carried on a bit, haven't they? So few of them. I mean, McAleely was at it throughout the whole game as well. Absolutely. And there's huge stakes. I mean, what we must never try to do, you know, we're in a stadium now, it's wonderful, you know, both sets of supporters and these days, physical contact. Just seeing Frank Lampard giving the Chelsea supporters an applause, getting them to raise their voices. But what we don't want is a lack of physical contact. Well, the referee walks towards the end, which behind the Manchester United fans are behind down there. So that's the end. It's to our left where these penalties are going to start. And, well, Stan Collin will be saying that they've had something like 135 kilometres to cover Chelsea. It's not a long walk, but it'll feel like a long walk if the strikers come back without scoring the goals. Penalty shootout in the Champions League final now between Chelsea and Manchester United. Here's Alan Green. And certainly it will be Carlos Tavez to take the first penalty kick in this shootout. For Manchester United, of course, Peter Check will be in goal. United have lost both their shootouts in European club competition. And I was commentating on an absolutely incredibly miserable night, also in Moscow, 16 years ago, from a bus with Jimmy Arnfield. We'll never forget it. That was in a slightly different arena to this one. Here's Tavez to try to put United in front, and he shoots United in front. Check went to the right. The penalty went to his left and United are a penalty up. Excellent start from Manchester United there. It came around it very, very well. I mean, my view is it's no excuse for a softly hitting penalty unless you score. I think you've got to get your accuracy, you've got to get your pace, and you've got to know exactly where you're going to put it. And certainly Tavez did extremely well then. Germans never miss penalties. And Michael Balak, of course, put one away recently against Manchester United in the Premier League. So it's Michael Balak against Edwin van der Zarr here in the penalty shootout. Balak studies himself and scores. I mean, was there any doubt ever about that? Van der Zarr was nowhere near it, and it's 1-1. Once again there it goes on that pace and power, knew exactly what he was doing. Even if you go, keep your nose away, they're going to do very well to get a hand to those kind of penalties. The penalties are being taken at the end to the left, behind which are the Manchester United supporters. So here is Michael Carrick. Right footed, and again he's checked very comfortably. Check went the wrong way, and Carrick bulleted the ball into the net. Yes, and then when the wrong way, she had to put it to checked left. Swung it with that power into the right-hand side. But three very, very good penalties so far. Well, this is why Baleti came on to take a penalty. By the way, the last time van der Zarr played in the Champions League final, he lost in a penalty shootout. This is his opportunity now to redress the balance. I'm tempted to say in Moscow, it's Russian rule XI. Penalty for Baleti and Chelsea, and at the moment they're 2-1 behind. Here comes Baleti, sends van der Zarr the wrong way, and it's 2-2. Just watching really as the goalkeeper's changed. Van der Zarr previously took an eternity to get up there. Baleti was waiting for him to come. Not so with Petr Cech, he's got himself into the goal. Do you think this shouldn't have finished before 2am? Here's Cristiano Ronaldo, who of course missed a penalty in the semi-final first leg away to Barcelona. So unusual for him. Will it be playing in his mind? Check crunching and the goal line. And Diver Orange, Ronaldo hesitated. No, he shouldn't! And Cech has made the save! Ronaldo's missed again! And van der Zarr! Could argue, trying to be clever. He's run up, stopped, tried to check him out, and then went in and checked himself as then read it. Well, Frank Lampard stepped up in the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool and this is his opportunity now to get Chelsea an advantage. So Ronaldo of all people has missed. And now if Lampard can keep his call, Chelsea will be in front. Lampard scores! Chelsea lead 3-2. Well, very, very confident, isn't it? You know the pressure on Lampard, the opposition just missed a penalty. And the pressure comes on you then, you know. If you can score, you put your team ahead. So very, very comfortable, excellent penalty. French time is being reached. It's on Hargreaves now from Manchester United, who trailed 3-2 and the penalty should out. Remember Chelsea lost in the semi-finals should out at Anfield last season in the Champions League. Hargreaves really needs to score. Right footed, checked out the right way, but it was a good penalty by the England player and their level 3-3 for the moment. Oh, it sure is, Mike. You were saying early, English player brought up in Germany. No problem whatsoever. What a good penalty that is. I've seen Ashley Cole take a few good penalties for Arsenal. Here he comes for Chelsea. Remember when Chelsea on this very night won the Cut Winners Cup? That was after a drawn game. They replayed two days later. They don't do that these days. Ashley Cole now has an opportunity to keep Chelsea in front. Ronaldo has missed, the only miss so far. Ashley Cole now, who lost in the Champions League final with Arsenal against Barcelona. Edwin van der Zal, just a little bit of gamesmanship there, talking to Cole. He's not going to have much of a run up here. He's going to take it left footed. Oh, and it's just crept in. It's just crept in off van der Zal's body. And Chelsea now lead 4-3. Seemed to go through, didn't he? Van der Zal read it correctly. Went to the right way. You look at the expressions of the Chelsea players there, but it's in the back of the net. That's all that matters. Now, it's very simple at this moment. Nani's going to take this penalty from Manchester United. If he misses, Chelsea are Champions of Europe for the very first time. What a responsibility on the young man's shoulders. He's already seen Ronaldo missed. It's a short run up for Nani. He's going to hit it right footed and check his beaten. It was an excellent penalty. Well, there is it. We talked, I was talking earlier about pressure. What more could there have been on that young man there? Just as a thing of Sir Alex Ferguson, a close-up there. What must be going through his mind? John Terry Chelsea captain. This is what is meant by leading from the front. John Terry, I mean, it's only a few days ago that he had a dislocated shoulder. He and Frank Lampard in particular have been so close to this holy grail for Chelsea. And how appropriate might it be if Chelsea are to win the Champions League for the first time in their history if the goal to take them to the glory is scored by this man? They're captain fantastic. John Terry has put it wide. He's missed it. He goes down in the penalty area. That was the opportunity. It has not been taken and Manchester United are alive again. I think he slipped, you know, just as he was taking it. Look, he does. His left foot slipped away from him. And there we are. It's a miss. We've seen that happen before. But his left boot went away from him. It slipped away from him. And he's taken the ball wide. Torrential rain in the Lesnicki Stadium in Moscow. Reprieve from Manchester United. And here's Anderson to put them in front in the shouldered. Left footed, driven in. Fantastic penalty. What a great deal of pace and power there. That was never done on target. Pace and power, certain goal. And how quickly things can turn around. Solomon Caloo wants to get on with this one quickly. He can't at the moment because Van Dazaar's not in his goal. Roman Abramovich can hardly bear to look in his city. This is beyond his control now. Caloo has to score. Or Manchester United win the Champions League. John Terry might have won it for Chelsea. Caloo has to score to keep them in the game and does. He scored it's 5-5. Very easy. Now I think he's going, he's a referee. I thought he was going to have a word with Van Dazaar. He needs to do because Van Dazaar, it's so obvious. Coming up so slowly, taking his time. Rand Giggs is next up. Well, the old man of this Manchester United team. Setting a record number of appearances for this club tonight. Surpassing the record previously held by Sir Bobby Charlton. It's 5-5 on penalties. We're in the extra time on penalties. Giggs left for it, easily beats Jack. Sends Jack the wrong way. Looks to put it as if he's going to put it in the right-hand corner. Swings it round to the left. Ball in the back of the net. Comfortable penalty. But the pressure is really on Chelsea. As long as Manchester United keep putting these penalties away. And their latest player to step up. Who's been quite a maverick really, had a roller coaster career. Nicholas Anelka. Anelka, just to repeat now, has to put this penalty away for Chelsea. To keep them in the Champions League final. Van Dazaar tries to spread himself as wide as he can. And makes the same for Manchester United. Van Dazaar denies Anelka. Denies Chelsea. And the new city famous for Red Square. It's a red night here in Moscow. As Manchester United once again become Champions of Europe. It's an extraordinary moment. Manchester United, the whole team of God, Ronaldo who is lying face down on the turf. Crys of joy from him. And just ten yards away. John Terry stooped. Hands in head. Obviously crying his eyes out there. What have I done? He had the chance to win it for Chelsea. For the first time. And Roman Abramovich is home city of Moscow. He is inconsolable. Ronaldo knows that he's got away with it. He absolutely knows he's got away with it. And John Terry knows it is probably his worst moment in football. Frank Lampard is now over there. Consoling him. Terry's head on Lampard's shoulder. And Ryan Gibbs, the Sol Manchester United player who goes over there. And says hard luck. Stan Collimore. This game can be so cruel. It can be so exciting. One way or the other, Mike and Alan were talking about that. Who would become the hero? Who the villain? Whose night might become a long, long one? It's having the Chelsea into John Terry. Manchester United are champions of Europe for the third time. Sir Alex Ferguson for the second time. Oh my word. Did the pitch change it with Terry there? His leg is standing. He did. The second wasn't it. Went up to take the penalty. And just at that critical moment, everything seemed to stop. He put the ball wide. And John Terry, the captain, so much of the vanguard of his Chelsea side. He's seen the growth of the club right the way to Abramovich. Well, congratulations to Manchester United. Well, John Terry has now got his manager, Avram Grant looking after him over there. More consoling for the Chelsea captain who is distraught at this moment. Vandessaar, who's been the other side of a penalty shootout in a final before, has punched the air. Manchester United, Wayne Rooney, who threw his shirt off when he was substituted, has got it back on now. And he stands alongside the only Mancunian in the team, Wes Brown, as they do a jig of delight. They're joined now by the rest of the United side. Tevez is in there. So too is Anderson. So too is Carrick. They're suddenly realizing what they've done. And he is wisdom. As the whole of the Manchester United side grouped down in front of me to the left here, to the cameras that have banked behind the corner flag. It is Manchester United's night. It is Fergie's night, what's more. Chelsea still stands stunned the way to my right. Calvario walks slowly around. Doesn't know what to do with himself. Ashley Cole stands with his hands on his hips, not knowing either what to do. And my word, there's a big deep breath needed for Chelsea, who had it. And he's led the Champions League. John Terry could not have strode forward with more confidence than he did. But he put it wide. It went on. And it's been finished by Van der Sar, who cannot believe what he's managed to do for Manchester United. He's away on the far side now, having slid across the cruising services and for the other photograph. And Manchester United found his way to my left here. Absolutely. In complete delight as Manchester United go on a half lap of honour here to start with. The surface is perfect for the dives as they all go to the far side of the penalty box. Chelsea fans away to my right. Absolutely stunned. This is all about Manchester United now. 0-500-909-693. That's the number to ring Alan Green after the presentation here in Moscow tonight. If you want to be part of 0-606. Well, his penalty is in the end. It's more than just a final. It is a knockout final. Both of these sides. But Sir Alex Ferguson, with what is really his third Manchester United team, has finally taken his second Champions League title. Absolutely. I think there's been 16 managers that have done this with two championships to their credit. He's got one more. Just wonder whether that will revitalise him. Obviously they're chasing Liverpool in terms of championships, 18. And now Bob Pace's record, he's only this tournament, having won it one-three. Wouldn't surprise you at all, would it? Sir Alex Ferguson wakes up in the early hours of the morning and wants to attack that task in hands. Just seeing the Manchester United players, it's been a long, old season. But pound for pound for me, they've been the best side in Europe. And I've won the title last year and regained it. It is lovely to see a team that has won their domestic title to go on and rightfully be crowned as champions of Europe. Balak's in tears. It mattered to him. He's shown coolness throughout his career, but he's overcome with the emotion tonight as well. John Terry still inconsolable. He is in all sorts of agonies. Steve Clark has been trying to sort him out there. And the rest of Chelsea have this agonising weight now, as Manchester United will make their way towards... I'm so pleased to say it's the proper way to present a cup of this magnitude. It'll be an old-fashioned step-up for Manchester United. Champions League winners. The double is theirs. What a magnificent double for Fergie and for this young Manchester United side. This could just be the real beginnings of something great for them as well, with so many young players involved. Fergie said, I trust my young players to deliver for me. They've done just that. The only thing of five-life sport, it's been a great game. It's perhaps not been the greatest football, but it has had absolutely everything in it. And just one thought, if Drogba hadn't stupidly got himself sent off, would John Terry have stepped forward to have taken that penalty? But it's about winners and their Manchester United. Mike Inger. To get this trophy, he's urging everyone to join him. It can be a cruel game, though, can't it? I mean, for John Terry of all people to miss the penalty, I remember him really going through it after the penalty shootout in Germany, after the World Cup defeat by Portugal. He has just crumpled down there, but as much as they try and console him, Peter Kenney and I see down there, it's all now about Manchester United. They didn't have penalty shootouts, did they, 50 years ago? But 50 years on from the tragedy in Munich, there was that big banner around the stadium earlier on for the Babes. The Babes, of course, were attempting to win that European Cup when they were tragically killed. And 40 years, of course, now on from the success, the first success at Wembley, Manchester United have won the trophy once more. They will walk up the steps where they will be received by a great former player himself, Michel Platini, won the European Cup with Juventus, Edwin van der Zarre, who was on the other end of it, as Mark was saying the last time he played in the Champions League final. He lost in a penalty shootout. First of all, though, the officials are going to go up. Michel Platini's waiting for that big trophy, that big trophy to set. And we think, we think, a set, a combination of Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand. It takes a little lifting this trophy. We think they will be the men to lift it. Ryan Giggs, on the night that he breaks, Sabobi Charlton's record, climaxing a fantastic career. And Rio Ferdinand, who was the captain tonight at the start of the game. So, Luthos, Michel and his officials get their medals. Manchester United wait for their final instructions. Edwin van der Zarre sticks his tongue out at the camera. Nani's doing all sorts of jigs down there. And the Chelsea players just have to stand in the torrential rain down there and wait. And all the Chelsea fans are still in the end of way to our right just to say goodbye and thanks to their team for the season. So, Bobby Charlton, whose Mac is splattered by the rain down there. So, Bobby Charlton hugs Rio Ferdinand, the Manchester United captain, as they wait to make the walk. Wembley, 1968, the drama of 1999 against Bayern Munich in Barcelona. And Sir Alex Ferguson maintains his 100% record in European finals, beginning of course with Aberdeen and now very much so with the team that may be considered now to be his best at Manchester United. I just want to tell you what Pergui has said tonight is exactly that, Mike, because Manchester United just waiting really with a guard of honour for Chelsea, the losers, I guess, to come through first and get their losers medals, not that they want them. Pergui has said we deserved it, we had the best chances in the match. In extra time we got better. It was a fantastic achievement. He thought it was a good game and when asked he said yes, this is the best United team ever. Well, he was holding back on that because he was asked about it yesterday and his answer really was, well, let's see what happens tomorrow. Sir Alex shakes the hands of the officials down there. We understand that the survivors of the Munich disaster, Albert Scanlon and Harry Gregg and Kenny Morgan and Phil folks are here with Sir Bobby Charlton, but it will be Chelsea, first of all, led by their Chief Executive Peter Kenyon and John Terry and Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Michael Essian, Ricardo Cavallio, Belletti and then Nelka, it was his penalty miss in the end or should it be to say from Edwin van der Zarr which finally settled the issue here. It's a tough game, Brian Taylor, isn't it? It certainly is. The situation is that when you come to the penalties there, when we know there's going to be the hero, there's going to be the villain, you cannot alter it. Great tension, great excitement. But at the end of the day it's Manchester United that come out with the trophy. Abram Grant and there will be all sorts of conversations and things written over the next few days about where he goes from here. He did actually start his press conference yesterday with the words, can I go now? Well, I think that might be one of the questions that will be asked now about him. As Sir Peter Kenyon receives a shield from the Michel Platteney, there will be some consolation for John Terry, but no words really. Stan Collymora, as you can join us as well now, watching these pictures of an emotional John Terry. There's nothing anyone can say. I mean, Bruce Sput there is putting his arm around him, one of the Chelsea directors, but John Terry completely disgraced. He's a very proud man, John Terry. He loves this club. He's been here since, well, the very beginning of the revolution really. And just as we're seeing that the losers' medals being given to the players, they won't count for anything. They'll find their way into the back of a draw. But a poignant moment for me was Bobby Charlton going over to Rio Ferdinand and just tapping him on the chest. You can imagine him saying, enjoy this because these moments, whoever you play for, whether it be Manchester United, Chelsea or whoever, don't come across very often. Two players just receiving runners-up medals for the second time in their career. It's Ashley Cole and Michael Balak. I mean, that's not really Michael Balak's scene at all. He wanted to win that more than anybody down there tonight. And Avram Grant as well, who's soaked to the skin, also gets a pat and a word from Michel Platini. Chelsea, who have come close, of course, since the Abramovich area began, the semi-final defeat against Monaco, the semi-final defeats against Liverpool, the Manchester United players at the moment are forming some kind of guard of honour and patting the Chelsea players as they retreat. And they will go across to their own fans, Chelsea, but the stage is about to be Manchester United's once that final Chelsea player has come. In fact, it's going to be Avram Grant who makes the long walk finally. Remember his emotional scenes going down on his knees at the end of that victory over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. Well, now Avram Grant departs the scenes and it's going to be all about the team in red. And the unbelievable Sir Alex Ferguson, really, who, let's face it, a few years ago, was on the way out of Manchester United. The legend goes that it was his wife, Kathy, who talked him out of premature retirement. And the fact that Sir Bobby Charlton is down there, I'm just wondering, you know, whether he may go up ahead of the queue in the way that Peter Kenyon did, but let's not prejudge things here. Yeah, and when you see Sir Bobby Charlton there for people of a certain age, which includes myself, it's a great fear, I mean, fantastic. But as Sir Alex says, we're in the present now and he says this is the best United side that he's had. Here we go. Río Ferdinand has a white tile draped around his shoulders. Manchester United starts their march up the steps to Michel Platini. That big trophy with the big ears, the big handles is weighted to be lifted and it is. The hero from 1968, the Munich survivor, Sir Bobby Charlton, who will lead Manchester United up to the rostrum there. And just how moving and appropriate is that. Manchester United is the big flag being raised away to our left. Manchester United's great, great night of the realm. Sir Bobby Charlton on the night when Ryan Giggs has gone one appearance better, followed by the football of the year and maybe this year's European player of the year, Christiana Ronaldo. There's a big embrace between Sir Bobby and Michel Platini. Bobby Charlton is, in fact, urging Michel Platini not to put the medal around his neck, but he's got a shield and he's got another hug and now Christiana Ronaldo, who got the show on the road here tonight with the first goal, he receives his first Champions League medal. Edwin van der Zarr gets his second. I can see Patrice Evera lining up now, having missed out with Monaco. He's got it. There's a big hug now between Christiana Ronaldo and Sir Bobby Charlton. The past, of course, and very much the present. And Sir Alex Ferguson, head plastered by the rain here. This is what he's all about, winning the trophies. Ryan Giggs shakes his... It's going to be that combination again that we saw at Wigan of Rio Ferdinand wearing the yellow armband that says C on it, but also Ryan Giggs, who will step forward to win the Champions League for the second time in his career to add to those 10 premiership titles. They're right at the end of the queue and ahead of them is Sir Alex Ferguson. There's a huge big beam on Rio Ferdinand's face. Goodness me, you know. You know what, I think that both of these players have come of age. They'll shake each other by the hand and wish each other all the very best, and that's how it should be. The medal placed around Rio Ferdinand's neck, the medal placed around Ryan Giggs' neck. The big mosaic from the United Fans away to our left and red and white before the game spelt the word, believe. And now they really do, as Michel Platini presents the game. The Champions League trophy for 2008 to Manchester United, to Ryan Giggs and to Rio Ferdinand, United Champions of Europe for the third time and they have done it for the Vates. Mike Kingham, Alan Gray, Grant Taylor and Stan Collimore, your commentators on Five Life Sport in Moscow tonight. We're getting well into the morning. 6.06 will be with you in a few minutes time. Grant Taylor and Stan Collimore are with me. Sir Alex Ferguson has achieved so much. Is he going to go on now to achieve even greater things? Yes, it's as simple as that. He ain't going to stop now. When is he going to stop? It's interesting, the two trophies is won. The two trophies are going to be won by the two players. It's as simple as that. He ain't going to stop now. When is he going to stop? It's interesting, the two trophies is won. You know, you've been in Munich, what last kick of the game, swings it round from 0-1 down to 2-1. Here, you're going out via penalties, miss, you win it by penalties. I mean, not just the penalties also. I mean, attention is always in this game. You both well know. I mean, twice Chelsea hit the woodwork. It's up on the floor with that equaliser from Frank Lampard, after Manchester United had totally dominated, but it wasn't to be. Absolutely. First half, you'd have to say, was Manchester United. Seconds, Chelsea. Certainly the extra time, Peter, there. We're just looking at these players. Anders Saar has just lifted the trophy. He's kissed it twice. Saul Wayne, Rooney, pick it up. Patrice Evera just about now to pick it up. This is what players play football for. You want to get your hand on the big trophies, and they will have a wonderful evening tonight. Four goals. What a moment for him as well, Stan, a true professional. Well, like Roy Keane, 1999, I'm sure was etched on four goals his face. Would he ever get his hands on it again? It's been a long, old time, eight years. But the little fella, for me, one of the best English players of the generation, thoroughly deserved. Well, this Manchester United side are going to celebrate long into the night here in Moscow. Chelsea have, sadly, is always the case, made their way after going down to their fans and to applaud what's left of their fans here before making their way down the tunnel. Fergie is there now, a broad smile across his face. He'll be part of the action tonight. What's the action like outside on Trafford, Nick Garnett? Well, this is what happened when the final penalty was taken. What are you thinking about? That was too much. Oh, my God. Get down. What are you thinking? Oh, unbelievable, unbelievable. I'm finished. I told Roy Geneberg, he'll miss the first penalty. Next thing, we're back. Unbelievable. I just, I just, I just got down. Unbelievable. Well, here at the pub, around the corner from Old Trafford, with four of the fans, just how was that for you? That was, that was a brilliant result for football. In what way? In the way that Chelsea's attrition football didn't come through. They got beat in the end. What were the nerves like in here, those penalties? I have to say, I walked away and didn't watch them. What about you? Did you watch them? Garnett, I did! Woo! Did you watch them? I couldn't bear to watch, but at the end, you just had to give in and just run, pray yourself towards the cellar, but best not have my life, just don't tell her. They'll be well, fans are going to be celebrating right the way throughout the night. Now the Manchester United side now make it back out of the pitch, led by Wayne Rooney on this occasion, a long-standing Amandason who's, what quick feet he's got, and some of the back rooms, staff who worked so hard, Perky was praising them yesterday, but the last 10 days following the end of the season was vital for the back room staff. They did absolutely everything right. Avram Grant was the last of the Chelsea team to leave the field. In fact, I think he probably took a lot of the losers medals over to the Chelsea fans who are still here, and they seem to throw them into the crowd over there too. It'll be Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs who won't let go of this trophy. The photographs are about to be taken here. West London will be quieter right now, Leslie Ashmull. Oh, absolutely remarkable. They are just bereft and listened to what it's like now with the streets here. I mean, there's nobody here, and just think how busy it was earlier on. They just piled out of the pub, they all went home immediately. They are absolutely distraught, absolutely distraught. Leslie, thank you very much indeed. Ronaldo had said that he's staying at Manchester United next season stand. Well, there's no need for him to go anywhere else. There are people talking about world record beats, bits from the likes of Real Madrid and the like. Manchester United have a base. Hang on, hang on. I've got to say, this is bizarre. We've had the streamers, their goals, it's like massive bits of ticket, and it's absolutely... The players can't move. They can't move. The players can't move. They're a golden generation. There's absolutely no doubt about that, Grant. You look at that, you have to laugh at it. Yellow tape, yellow tape, and they're literally covered. When they all came down, the whole Manchester United squad was covered by them, and all you could see was this moving mass of tape. They've gone out of it now, and they're taking the cup to the Manchester United supporters. Leslie, Ronaldo and West Brown with Rio Ferdinand, Anderson really loving the moment. Wayne Rooney too, the whole of the United side are there. So, in life, there's sympathy, as there is in football sometimes too. 50 years on from Munich then, Manchester United have won the championship of Europe. I remember on this year's 50th anniversary of that terrible disaster, the surviving goalkeeper, Harry Gregg, spoke to me about the future. He didn't want to look back. He wanted closure. And I guess tonight, this current Manchester United side have given him and the other survivors and the surviving relatives just that. They can close a chapter. I hope we've forgotten, but Sir Alex Ferguson and this current Manchester United can now open a new chapter for this extraordinary football club. It's Manchester United's night in Moscow. It's your chance to have your say with five live and six oh sixes, Alan Green. An all English Champions League final, Manchester United, Chelsea in Red Square.
