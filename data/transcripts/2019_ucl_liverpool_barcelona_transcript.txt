 to take us into extra time it is a tall order for Liverpool however they've produced remarkable and memorable nights in the past Alan Shearer here and the crowd have done their bit as we knew they would it's now over to the players they don't have to go crazy they don't have to go for them in the first 10 or 15 minutes they can afford to sit tight and be patient and stay in this game the referee is Kunya Chikir from Turkey if you're looking for Olens he was the referee when Liverpool produced that incredible comeback against Borussia Dortmund as from the kickoff Liverpool look to go and press Barcelona and in the program notes tonight from Jurgen Klopp the message was as follows this Liverpool never stops this Liverpool never quits we don't do if only well we will find out if Liverpool can produce it however Messi comes forward now he might have something to say in the opening seconds but he stopped and it was a challenge by Robertson Messi's only now getting himself to the floor as Milner will play it forward Liverpool playing from right to left Mane listen to the Anfield crawl route raw early chance just nicked away from Henderson of the far post behind for a corner kick from Liverpool gone from the off lovely run from Mane into a reagan we just go Henderson was going to stretch that leg out there but just past him corner Liverpool they said they'd have to take it step by step he talked about celebrating this Champions League occasion with their legs and their lungs the Liverpool supporters are doing their bit with the lungs the Liverpool players with their legs Messi is still having a word with Robertson from the way that he was stopped for that early break away for Barcelona and the Turkish referee has prevented the corner kick from being taken and he's having a word with Messi and Robertson who are still having a war of words yeah when Robertson Messi thought he was fouled by Robertson stood on the ground and just as Robertson was walking past him he put his hand on his shoulder whether he said something too many zero not but Messi clearly wasn't happy with that it is definitely inside Anfield corner kick for Liverpool far side the right and it goes towards the near post the Vino tried to meet it Suarez then will clear that ball away only as far as Henderson and Henderson goes back to Allison BBC Radio 5 live we also have our friends from BBC Radio Merseyside who are with us here at Anfield on a raucous night where Liverpool are defending the Cop End so they'll be attacking the Cop End in the second half just as they were against Borussia Dortmund three years ago but into Milan in 65 San Etienne in 77 Olympiacos Chelsea there have been unforgettable nights at Anfield but it would probably top the lot if they could add Barcelona in 2019 to that list of unforgettable nights here on this famous ground van Dyck to Matty just short of the halfway line forward to Alexander Arnal early touch inside to Henderson gives it away to Busquets Liverpool will try and win it back for Vino to Origi Barcelona now Sergio Roberto and the clearance by Piquet booed because of his Manchester United connections and it runs off the head of Matty and back to Allison Alan Shearer it's not as well when Liverpool have the ball they're just took and continued in that left-hand side there to try and make it a four in midfield rather than the three to make that extra number in there we're also on the red button the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website tonight with our commentary tomorrow night we're in Amsterdam Thursday night we're in Valencia the European games lie from inside the stadium come thick and fast and this is national radio commentary exclusive to BBC Radio 5 live this evening no no Henderson looks to turn midway through the Barcelona half Matty forward ball Shaqiri David left foot try to play it forward but it went behind Mane and to Steggen will clear but it's been a very lively start both on and off the pitch four minutes played no no Roberto will go back to Steggen I thought Shaqiri would have been better I'm having a shot there you know you tried to pick his head up and clear the pass instead of a perfect goal 20-22 yards out fallen a little bit out of favour as the Swiss international last start before tonight was against Leicester City on the 30th of January hasn't scored since boxing day against Newcastle United here you were here that day was here 11 games without a goal for Shaqiri it's that front three with Eureki and Mane in the absence of Firmino and Salah hoping that Salah will be back for the final day the five live will bring you all the drama Manchester City 95 points Liverpool 94 what a Titanic tussle that has been Manchester City right Liverpool are at home to walls that's on Sunday but this is the Champions League and it's live on five live the ball is bowled out by Allison the bearded goalkeeper all in gray Robertson plays it forward on this near side the left PK right behind Mane stabs it out of play for a throw that Liverpool want to take quickly Milner will leave it to Robertson we've been playing for just over five minutes Fabina out to Mane on this near side the left level of the penalty area that doubled upon him challenge comes in from Vidal behind for a corner kick Liverpool and that was good from Allison you know when he collects that ball there you get it and he fizzes that ball out to the to the full back with pace on it just to keep momentum going and they go straight up through the end and get the corner cries of Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool as Alexander Arnold the young England international comes across to this near side the left to take it in front of the travelling section of support from Barcelona look how crowded that six yard area is there is a clutch of Lumina shirts there's four red shirts in there as well as it's played in towards the near post from Alexander Arnold the corner Henderson tries to play it back to him interception from Raketic sliding and then Milner inside the centre circle back to Allison just outside the D of his penalty area at the cop ended anfield six minutes played nil nil Shaqiri collects a diagonal ball goes in field to Matty Robertson is on the outside of him on this near side Matty though with a diagonal ball Mane has popped up on the right actually gets there Mane nixon inside Henderson into the penalty area Henderson on the corner up Oregi the black stays down and Liverpool have made the perfect start inside seven minutes that's the only goal they wanted they lead by a goal to nil it's Oregi what a start for Liverpool if you thought this place was rocking before and listen to it now a crossfield ball from Fabino who then finds Henderson in there thought he'd fluff the chance Keefer makes a good save Oregi tucks it into the back of the net they're going crazy it will be checked as a matter of course by VAR but the goal stands and Liverpool have the start that they wanted Divock Oregi they're on the attack again Milner to Mane you think it was brilliant play from Mane you know because he read the poor header from Alba I think it was he tried to head it back but he intercepted that and he kept that ball moving and Oregi on the follow-up from Tishtegan who just couldn't keep it out from Henderson Liverpool lead by a goal to nil Suarez though is on the attack running forward over on that far side Matty comes across Liverpool have a goal the crucial factor is they still have to deny Barcelona from scoring because one goal for Barcelona and Liverpool then will require five but in terms of making the perfect start Liverpool have just produced it didn't Suarez seems going to be respectful in front of the cop and the left can not change its spots so Liverpool lead by a goal to nil they trail 3-1 on aggregate corner kick though for Barcelona over on that far side in front of the cop in it goes Shakira on the edge of the area has sliced his clearance touched forward by Alexander Arnal Mane Mane's been everywhere he's been on the left he's been on the right Oregi might off as the back pass went to Tishtegan Oregi and he put out an outstretched thought Matty got there Shakiri Liverpool have momentum Henderson far side the right they've just got to keep their composure but they lead by a goal to nil I thought Oregi could have stuck his foot out there you know I didn't got that there was a terrible back pass I just thought I don't know why he didn't well I spoke to many people in the football world over the last few days and I said if it could happen there's one place where you would say it wouldn't it be Anfield and certainly in these opening nine minutes or so they are threatening to produce the unexpected as Mane cuts forward goes down he's told to get up by the Turkish referee Kunik Shakir went down a little bit too easily Liverpool pick up the loose ball Liverpool at the minute though Alan are winning every ball they are so superior and sharper and and that ball there that van Dijk has been a key already there's been one from Mattyp and then another one from there from from van Dijk that got Liverpool in there in front and they also when Oregi chased that back pass down that was also a long ball ball drilled out from that far side Alexander Arnald who's still stayed out on this near side the left couldn't keep it in play is that a permanent switch at the minute they don't seem willing to to change do they Alexander Arnald stayed on the left and and Robertson the left back on the right here is Suarez challenge comes in from Fabinho what a challenge that was was always got a yellow card for it 70 possession for Liverpool in these early stages I thought that was a hard but a fair challenge you know Suarez went into it also aggressively rolling over he got the ball it was firm very firm but but it looks a fair challenge Fabinho however has been booked for that challenge on Suarez tell you what Suarez certainly felt the effects of it didn't it welcome back to Anfield and a couple of rules over as well but walking perfectly now Anfield rocking BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Mercy side Liverpool lead by a goal to Neil we've been playing for just over 11 minutes Barcelona have won 38 of 42 UEFA ties when they've won the first leg at home I wasn't good at maths at school so at the aid of a calculator I've worked out that that is a 90% success ratio you could say that's a 10 success chance for Liverpool but then you're missing Firmino and Salah does it reduce that they haven't told these Liverpool players because if they want to fail in the most beautiful way they have certainly started that in these opening 12 minutes as they lead by a goal to Neil and all of a sudden they can get our breath because it's a goal kick to Barcelona Aurelius goal after seven minutes for Liverpool and that's why these Liverpool supporters still believe to Steggen to take the goal kick looks to go right down the middle they've pulled it out of play it'll be a Liverpool throw on that far side you see even at 1-0 at half time attacking the cop end it's still on isn't it it's still on because they haven't conceded yet we said it was a brilliant opportunity for them because they know they'd go after after Barcelona and close them down they did exactly that and the crowd reacted to them as well what a start for them it is the start that everybody inside Anfield of a Liverpool persuasion wanted Firmino listed across towards that far side now Alexander-Arnold is back in his customary position on that right hand side goes out of play it will be a Liverpool throw just short of the halfway line as it goes infield Milner's going to come under pressure from Vidal turns and he's curling ball which is defeated Robertson head down over the halfway line Messi goes to confront it Robertson then midway through the Barcelona half tries to nick it inside Mane it's been superb very sharp here he is picking up that ball his anticipation he's reading everything at the mark at the minute he's playing as a midfielder as well as an attacker van Dijk now at the back Crossfield ball Shaqiri brings it down off his left foot nice touch try to wriggle away from his man goes to ground no free kick Barcelona under pressure will build from the back Busquets looks to turn Vidal close down by Milner Messi van Dijk chases in Vidal quickly tries to switch play Flak stays down over on that far side Barcelona coming forward right hand side ball pulled back Messi tipped over by Alisson corner kick brilliant play from both Petino and Alba down that left hand side and just got to the byline and pulled it back for Messi there good save first time there's been a real threat down there Alisson had to be alert comfortable height round head height to tip it around for a corner kick Liverpool still lead by a goal to nil the Barcelona goal would really deflate the atmosphere corner kick is swung over headed away by Mati collected by Shaqiri corner his own penalty area drifts out towards the right touch line and will win a throw didn't really have much else on the Swiss international as Alexander Arnault will go across towards the far side to take the the throw not much movement for him he's just joined us Euregia scored for Liverpool after seven minutes they lead by a goal to nil on the night Liverpool have never lost both legs of a European semi-final they are a club with a proud and illustrious history in this competition and despite the odds being stacked against them they're giving it a go as you'd expect Piquet plays it forward last time Barcelona lost by three goals to nil was when they lost in the competition last year to Roma Roma though have the benefit of an away goal from the new camp before they return to the Stadio Olimpico there is no insurance policy for Liverpool that's why they have to guard against the Barcelona goal tonight as Roberto plays the ball forward Busquets sweeps it down blindly Fabinho makes the challenge against Messi Alba on that far side Coutinho is ahead of him former Liverpool player comes under a bit of pressure Busquets Vidal now the single lot more of the ball of Barcelona as they trail by a goal to nil 16 minutes played Busquets plays it forward Alba strokes it back opportunity Messi wants it too many touches now the flag is raised the Liverpool fans aren't happy but the UEFA officials are told to delay the flag what was he doing passing then he's through one on one and go he picks his head up and tries to find Messi instead of going for the goal surprised that he seems so reluctant Shaqiri Fabinho forward of the centre circle Robinson near side the left about 10 yards in from the touch line goes back to Milner Van Dijk much better from Barcelona that there wasn't it keeping the ball passing it everyone getting a touch of it beautiful run from Alba down that left hand side and you could sense the nervousness as well when Barcelona in possession because everybody is aware of what a Barcelona goal would do to the dynamic of the tie Henderson the dynamic of the tie can you imagine what this place will go like if Liverpool go to Nalor Mane brings it down off his chest right corner of the penalty area tries to get away from from his man plays it in Lenglé was behind him low cross cleared by Piquet back out towards that right hand side Henderson plays it back Alexander-Arnold scoops the ball forward Shaqiri was there Lenglé will turn stab back penalty area it goes to and cleared away swept down field then by Piquet headed back by Mati comes under pressure Milner from Vidal wins the ball in the halfway line Messi now running at the heart of Liverpool defence to Coutinho good save by Alisson and pushes them all away from Suarez very good save Barcelona are still threatening Roberto inside Raketech little flick there by Coutinho Alba on the overlap in towards the near post show me behind for a corner kick brilliant from Lionel Messi James Milner gets the ball nicked off him on the halfway line Messi's driving forward he just pushes that out to the left hand side for Coutinho and Alisson did very well you know because he didn't push it back into the middle of the goal he pushed it away from goal very good save it's been an excellent Champions League semi-final second leg on five lie corner kick for Barcelona didn't beat the first man headed away Barcelona with Messi Struc strikes it just wide left footed edge of the area pulled it that looked close what a game we've got on here it's end to end Barcelona finding their passing moves now and he's hanging around on the edge of the box from the from the corner and just as we've seen pulling the trigger there you're thinking oh no but it just goes wide Liverpool lead by a goal to nil Alisson to Messi tomorrow night we're in Amsterdam as Tottenham will look to try and get the early goal to wipe out that Donny van der Beek goal that they conceded at the Tottenham hotspur stadium this time last week here we are though at Anfield this van Dyke picks up on a loose ball and just plays it forward Fabinho Robertson now the left back back to Fabinho just outside the center circle Matip on the halfway line plays it forward Eureki turns sharp turn as well Eureki coming forward loses out to Vidal Liverpool win it back through Henderson Fabinho plays it forward Referrino has given a free kick in favour of Barcelona a similar tackle to Fabinho's wasn't it on Milner just thought that was hard and fair as well was he a little bit late though it was on Sergio Roberto takes a little bit of the ball but his follow through catches him as well doesn't it yeah so it's a free kick to Barcelona Alan Shearer with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live I don't know what it is about you but we always seem to attract the big exciting games thought you were going to see the goals but we know that everybody knows that your record speaks for itself but every time you appear on five lie I don't think you've done a duffer yet have you don't speak too soon Allison clears downfield Liverpool 1-0 20 minutes played and there's two balls in operation at the minute and that's why there is a delay so it's a Barcelona throw over on that far side certainly the Liverpool supporters know how to generate an atmosphere and a European night that was late Milner this time wasn't it on Suarez of all of them that's the one way you'd say maybe a yellow card because he was late yet Favigno was booked Henderson was given a warning and Milner was very fortunate I think to to avoid a yellow Suarez he's put on a little bit of timber isn't he Suarez not so quick how was it getting on a bit but it was his goal last week his first typically in the Champions League against his former side that set Barcelona on their way to a 3-0 victory in the new camp of course Messi added his magic in the last course of an hour Messi who has a record of scoring against English opposition right here with 600 goals he has a record of scoring against anybody really but Liverpool lead by a goal to nil as Henderson downfield finds Mane Mane all alone in the centre circle comes forward Vidal in pursuit Mane plays it forward Henderson had made a run through comes out from the Barcelona clearance to Favigno Shakir he floats it in headed away by Langley picked back up by Robertson Henderson is there takes an inflection cleared away by Alba and it comes off an outstretched leg of Favigno and out of play for a Barcelona throw on the far side the left one middle Liverpool they're worried about Mane they don't know whether to go tight on him or sit off on him and at the minute they're doing neither and he's causing them all sorts of problems he had a brilliant start to the game he has good work from Robertson again down the left hand side just pulling it back to the edge of the box Mane who has scored 11 goals in his last 11 infield appearances he's having an excellent game he is being a real nuisance he's being a pest with the referee has given a foul against against Mane which has been taken by Barcelona that free kick Raketic they'll want to try and slow things down the tempo won't suit Barcelona the way that Liverpool are playing has carrying and hassling and trying to put them under pressure leading by a goal to nil midway through this first half Pk now will come forward and Van Dijk just wrestles Suarez to the floor plays it early Mane inside the penalty area Mane waits inside left channel gets the shot away comes out to Robertson being away by Tishtegen that was moving in the air Tishtegen made a flying save as again Suarez goes to ground and the referee has bought it rolling around and gets the free kick Suarez wants the referee to show a yellow card to Van Dijk that was brilliant from Van Dijk again you know he just took the ball off Suarez in front of him and then placed a beautiful ball into into Mane who was left one on one he's touched just took him too far towards the byline and then pulled it back for Robertson to have that stinging shot into the goalkeeper they adored him at times they defending it when he was a Liverpool player he scored 69 goals in 110 appearances in the Premier League but he's just been with cries of cheat cheat sheet labeled at the Uruguayan Liverpool have a slender advantage on the night they still trail by two goals on aggregate five live and BBC Radio Mercy side here at Anfield Matty pops it up Alexander Arnold down into the ground Henderson to Shaqiri Shaqiri plays it forward Mane again in between the two central defenders Henderson again does well to read that heads it forward Mille the plays it out towards Origi Origi's ball into the penalty area cleared away by Peké Henderson keeps making those late runs into the penalty area the boozle telling that Suarez Suarez is on the ball and Van Dijk once again is putting them under pressure messy little touch with the head there to Alba back to messy over the halfway line Raketic frenetic second leg of this semi-final ball played up towards Suarez excellent defending by Robertson on the cover the left back with an outstretched foot just to guide it to Allison to prevent the ball from reaching Suarez beautiful tackle that was time to perfection wasn't it because you just saw Suarez drifting and trying to get him behind him there Raketic now will come running forward for Barcelona Alba making ground on that far side the left back reaches the ball Alba's cross from the left hand side messy heads it on headed away by Fabinho Mane on the edge of his area he will clear he's everywhere the stadium Mane Origi holds the ball up out towards Shaqiri Shaqiri now runs at Busquets comes on the inside and then he just loses the ball and Lengue steps forward and then gives the ball away pace of this game is just relentless i'm amazed at Barcelona because every time they get a free kick or a throwing they're taking it quickly i thought they'd try and kill the game the being sucked into Liverpool's passage of play they're trying to match them stride for stride matching them with the tempo it suits Liverpool it's like two heavyweight boxes slugging it out the worry though for Liverpool is that a Barcelona goal with the equivalent of a knockout blow and that's what Liverpool still have to guard against but they lead by a goal to nil but Liverpool in these 26 minutes and in particular Mane have been fantastic Raketic but you'd think with the experience that Barcelona have they would try to kill the to the tempo they'll try to silence the crowd look at you got Busquets are peeking they're messy in there i'm absolutely right i just think one of them would put their foot on the ball and just say no we're going to control this game or try and control this game at our pace but they've just gone after it they say exactly the same as what Liverpool have intoxicating not only is this spectacle but also as the atmosphere as these two sides battle it out for a place in the final in Madrid where Barcelona are on course for a treble wrapped up the title they've got the Copa del Rey against Valencia in Sevill to look forward to on the 25th of this month and then they want to be in Madrid for the Champions League final Liverpool still posing questions they lead by a goal to nil Busquets now the game is just starting to slow down and Barcelona are doing what we've been talking about but they weren't before lane play forward Coutinho out towards that far side Raketic keeping the ball Raketic makes the run down the left hand side Suarez making a run into the penalty area Vidal is also forward it'll touch by Suarez messy looking to turn takes it outside the penalty area with his back to goal here is messy plays it forward Raketic with the cross and turned behind by Robertson Messi just hanging around the in-yard box wasn't he picks his head up and he sees Raketic run into that 18-yard box and he on the volley just tries to ping it across the the goal there but good defendant again Robertson I think it was who got it away in the buildup to that attack Liverpool were complaining that Coutinho had checked for Benio as the corner is taken short on this right hand side they're attacking the cop end playing from left to right Messi swings over the cross it's deep inside the penalty area flags up on this near side the cheers will tell you that one guess who was offside Suarez and Liverpool take the free kick short just under half an hour Liverpool lead by a goal to nil Shaqiri for Benio Alexander Arnold will get a throw that game against Borussia Dortmund will live long in the memory in 2016 and a remembering fact it might have been a Coutinho goal in the second half gonna say I wonder what that'll do for the atmosphere I said that's what it does for the atmosphere and the same applies tonight if Liverpool were to score the second goal to take the within touching distance of Barcelona as Barcelona have two players down Jordi Alba I'm trying to see who the other player is on that far side Alba is back on his feet Lengler is the other one who's down and now all of a sudden it seems like they're we can have a little bit of a breather now there's a stoppage in the game there hasn't been too much opportunity for that for what has been a breathless first 30 minutes here at Anfield and in this stoppage Jürgen Klaup is having a word with his left tenant James Milner down in front of us and what's it going to be is it going to be a drop ball Barcelona have to give it back to Liverpool because Liverpool had possession so it is knocked back by Rakitic and Alisson will chest the ball forward Fabinho van Dijk midway through the Liverpool half now with Mati Henderson's forward on the right Eureki and Mane through the middle Milner's on the left hand side so they have whipped as Eureki drifts out towards Henderson the two combine Eureki back to Henderson nice little turn runs into trouble loses the ball Barcelona with Busquets turns and Alba will clear Henderson has stayed down and therefore there is another stoppage in play and that's the last thing that Liverpool would want because he and the fact that's just he's shaking his head Jürgen Klaup muttering to himself because he knows that he can't afford another injury and not when you've got the energetic Henderson being that driving force from midfield but Henderson's not moving but it was good play from him in a riggy and good interplay between the both of them little one two give and go and he just overruns it just Henderson and catches gets caught on the on the knee a little bit late so Henderson is getting treatment and Jürgen Klaup will be anxiously watching on by now then would be the natural replacement because the other substitutes Brewster and Woodburn very young Sturridge Gomez and Lovren so Vinaldo would be the one in fact Vinaldo is already taking off his training top so Vinaldo is getting stripped and ready for action that the fact that he didn't move was an ominous sign wasn't it Alan? Yeah he was um as I said he just overrun that that ball so he's lunging into to get the tackle and I thought it was Langley that caught him late because he just got to the ball before him but we said Liverpool would get chances in the in the game they have they've got one goal could have had another one but for for a couple of decent saves they've had to rely on their goalkeeper also Allison to um to pull off a save or two but it's been a what what has it been a crack in 32 minutes it's been Henderson is still down at the moment 32 minutes on the clock this is a lengthy stoppage in play as Vinaldo waits to to come on a reminder that tomorrow night we are live in Amsterdam Iax against Tottenham Iax of course lead by a goal to nil from the first leg in north London a week ago and on Thursday night we'll have commentary from the Messiah Valencia against Arsenal Arsenal who have a three-win advantage with updates of Chelsea against Eintracht Frankfurt 1-1 from the first leg in Germany Henderson is up on his feet he's walking a little gingerly but he's over on that far side gets a nice ovation from the Liverpool supporters and the Liverpool captain looks like he might well be in a position to continue he's trying to walk it off it's a drop ball Liverpool will sportingly give the ball back to Barcelona as we have 12 minutes to go to halftime and Henderson returns to the field of play BBC Radio 5 Live and Radio Mercer side Liverpool lead by a goal to nil to Stegg and picks the ball up two central defenders have peeled out wide but Liverpool with a combination of Shaquiri and Eureka Mane from right to left have prevented the ball being thrown out short so he has to go long Alexander-Arnold has it now midway through his own half he turns and plays it forward Peké will volley the ball away downfield header from van Dijk drifts out towards that far side the right and Alexander-Arnold will play the ball forward last touch ran off a Reagie a Barcelona throw on that left hand side that stoppage in play has just unsettled the rhythm of the game hasn't it and the crowd have just gone a little bit quiet for the first time as well throw that Liverpool will take Alexander-Arnold back to Matty Alisson from his feet to van Dijk Virgil van Dijk he's won 150th appearance for an English club his 50th in European competition who's been immense this season for Liverpool as the ball is given away cheaply Suarez turns Messi behind him coming onto the ball now Messi though is challenged by Henderson Vidal slides in to win it against Henderson Messi loses out mill the takes off his toes mill the now coming forward over the halfway line through the centre circle dredging forward Legne well Legne appeared to check Mane but referee Konnec Cicke is certainly not enduring himself for the Liverpool supporters says no foul great play from James mill now he gets the ball off Messi and he drives it forward he just passes that ball in behind there and lengthy just sticks his arm out there and says no way are you running past me Mane ball cleared by Tischtegen Robertson challenges Sergio Roberto Vidal plays it forward Messi releases it Jordi Alba comes forward now the left back over the halfway line Vidal little back heel touches the ball to Messi Suarez sweeps it out now to Roberto right corner the penalty area low ball in cleared by van Dijk back to Roberto plays it in again headed away by van Dijk once more Liverpool lead by Goulton Hill and we have 10 minutes of this incredible first half remaining as Vidal then has caught Nielsen and the ironic cheers will tell you that that decision has gone in favour of the home side there is so much going on off the ball here is Suarez run trying to get into the box Matip blocks him then they're complaining that they haven't a little pop it mess it's happened all over the pitch Liverpool one Barcelona Niel nine minutes of normal time remaining the first half Liverpool in all red playing from right to left Milner plays it short and forward Ehrigi just over the halfway line running in field now forward ball to Henderson Henderson holds onto it midway through the Barcelona half and finds Milner Milner plays it down the left hand side Mane has taken pk with him Mane does the little step over just outside the penalty area down towards the byline works over the cross Coutinho inside his own penalty area plays it away it's retrieved though by Shakiri Fabinho back to Shakiri Shakiri with a cross too close to Teštega Coutinho doesn't like what he's having to do because the full backs are pushing that far on and Shakiri on that other side as well Coutinho is having to defend in his own 60 yard box the voice of Alan Shearer on BBC Radio Five Live here at Anfield exclusive national radio commentary from BBC Five Live ball played forward up towards Mane challenged by Roberto picked up by Rakitic the Croatian international runs forward then plays it back to the halfway line in their luminous shirts and shorts playing from left to right Barcelona with Busquets being held a little bit by Fabinho free kick that Busquets will take plays it out towards Jordi Alba try to lay it off first inside first time stopped by Liverpool Henderson looks up looks for the searching diagonal ball that's over the shoulder by Sergio Roberto Mane was chasing him plays it back to Teštega it's exactly the same thing again they get the foul on straight away hand on the ball and they want to get the ball back into play as quick as possible seven minutes to go at a half time Messi plays it forward Coutinho lifts it Van Dyke will head it away and then Robertson will head the ball in field Matip and Van Dyke combine clear the danger for Liverpool Barcelona have it though once again Busquets just outside the centre circle ball played forward Messi was on side Alexander Arnold had played him on Alexander Arnold prevention prevents the ball from reaching Alba back with Alexander Arnold clears the left footed downfield and Lengley will go across Lengley keeps the ball in play plays it back to Teštega has to clear it hurriedly comes to Fabinho forward ball to Milner Milner gets it out from underneath his feet Fabinho forward of the centre circle now to Mane on the overlap is Robertson if he wants him just outside the penalty area Mane has his attempted cross charged down picked up by Milner Mane comes under pressure challenged by Vidal inside now to Messi Messi has to deal with Fabinho and then Mane Mane gets something on the ball but it still somehow sticks to the feet of Messi who runs back into the centre circle Vidal and Chilean almost every outfield player is in the half Liverpool have two banks of four back behind the ball as Rakitic tries to pull it out to Jordi Alba and again it goes out of play for a throw he is so good at that isn't he Lionel Messi when he gets that ball and running up with it with his left foot there's so strong in possession Fabinho has one one kicking him then Mane has another kick at him and he still manages to keep hold of the ball Robertson is down Jurgen Klopp has already had course for concern with Jordan Henderson and a knock to the knee and now Robertson at the moment is the physio coming on to 10 to the Scottish international and again there's a rather resigned look on the face of Jurgen Klopp as his name rings around Anfield for somebody who is so popular here and has been such a bargain of assigning eight million pounds from home. Magnificent season he's had. Spotted by Steve Bruce when he was the the whole city manager and it was certainly an excellent bit of business you know when you're talking about Messi when it was a stat I saw in the in a daily mail from Dominic King last week when he'd scored his 600th goal for Barcelona the Ian Rush and Wayne Rooney the record goal scorers for Liverpool and Manchester United a tally of 346 and 253 goals combined still Messi out scores them. That's not a bad record is it? It is absolutely ridiculous 600 goals. Robertson with the applause I'm sure you've realised he's back to his feet and ready to come on and we have four and a half minutes as the ball went back to Allyson and as he acrobatically volleyed the ball away was being closed down by Suarez. Liverpool still lead by a goal to nil. The crucial bit is the nil because that means that there is still genuine hope a three nil scoreline at the end of 90 minutes and we go to extra time and we all know what Liverpool can do in the second half of games. Messi Vidal. Messi closed down by Fabinho but he manages to wriggle away from Fabinho. Messi still going just outside the D goes back with Sergio Roberto the right back Vidal with his mojica. Roberto Liverpool just keeping their shape. Barcelona have the ball Vidal gives it away Milner plays it forward Marne stabs it back Milner plays a diagonal ball forward Fabinho opens up his body looks for the ball through the middle towards Shaquiri and cleared away by Tishtegen who came out of his penalty area. Matty midway through the Liverpool half directs his header out towards the right scampering after it. Alexander-Arnold midway through the Barcelona half Alexander-Arnold comes in field Shaquiri plays it forward does it reach Marne it was an outstretched leg that took it away from Marne into the hands of Tishtegen. Just Gerard Piquet stuck that left leg out just at the last minute there when Marne was running in behind him a vital touch. The Liverpool crowd playing their pout too. They are not changing Barcelona they're still looking for their goal they still they still want their full backs to push as far forward as Liverpool's off. Oregi for Liverpool midway through the Barcelona half goes on the outside of Raketic Oregi right hand side of the penalty area fires it in low Piquet stood firm in the challenge with Marne. Henderson to Robertson shot shot down they're appealing for handball it'll go behind for a corner kick. It's good play from Oregi down that right hand side he chose not to cross at the first time but then put the put the ball in Marne nearly got to it comes out to Robertson and Vidal goes to close him down and the shout from the Anfield road end was handball but no it's gone out for that corner. That's the end that Alan Shearer is talking about that Liverpool are attacking in all red playing from right to left. Shaqiri on this near side going to be an out swinging corner from the left flicked on at the near post drops to Alexander Arnold down into the ground Raketic will lead the break for Barcelona and Messi just waits it's Piquet striding through the middle Messi though will kill the ball out towards that far side to Jordi Alba central position back towards Messi to Piquet Piquet goes to ground Liverpool now can break and Piquet's out of position but there are still four Barcelona shirts to Liverpool's red if two and Barcelona curve the counter attack that never really had gained enough momentum but it is helter skelter stuff here at Anfield. It's incredible that one wasn't it they get the defend from the corner and the furthest man forward and you look up is Piquet that tells you how they're going to play and how they're going to carry on trying to score that goal. It's been a fabulous first half where Liverpool lead by a goal to nil Vidal Raketic in the centre circle Raketic to Busquets Busquets with a curling ball to Sergio Roberto the Barcelona right back is faced by Robertson Vidal there will be an imagine at least three maybe even four minutes have added on time. Messi collects the ball just outside the centre circle and now almost at walking pace casually plays it to Coutinho back with Busquets Sergio Roberto Liverpool still working hard off the ball Milner pushes Barcelona and Piquet back Lenglé clears downfield strikes it long Matip though with a drop down header to reach Alexander-Arnold and he plays it forward but it goes out of play it'll be a Barcelona throw on that far side the left as we're about to find out how much added on time there will be I don't know about you but I need to breathe her at half time. It's just been absolutely relentless hasn't it it's been non-stop from that very first whistle. Four minutes have added on time which we're now into here at Anfield. A minimum of four minutes Milner goes back, Allyson plays it out to this near side his left back Robertson clears left footed. Oregi didn't work hard enough when they were away to Porto in this Stadio dragout in the previous round but he certainly put a little bit more of a shift in tonight as Busquets has left one off Fabinho and he's shown a yellow card he's lucky there you know he runs in through and leading with his elbow just turns on the side which the referee might see and that might just save him so Sergio Busquets shown a yellow card on the stroke of half time Fabinho himself was booked earlier in the half still Liverpool lead by a goal to nil are they able to fashion one more opportunity in this first half or they wait for words of wisdom from Jurgen Klopp in the half-time break chance to re-energize the batteries and those batteries certainly will need recharging given it everything in this first 45 minutes and some van Dyke back to where to Allyson Allyson will play the ball short, Matty Fabinho in front of him now on the ball just outside the centre circle Milner Robertson like a Jurissel bunny Andrew Robertson talking of batteries the way that he gets up and down this near side the left Milner plays it forward when it sails into the arms of Tishtegin Tishtegin will hold on to the ball it's been such a captivating first half though so fast Suarez trying to get away from Matty Matty deals with it here is Fabinho Fabinho opens it up Robertson Chiquiri will be sold Robertson short with that pass and Vidal was able to intercept Messi threads it forward Sergio Roberto joining the attack Sergio Roberto back to Messi Messi's pulled it wide never struck it cleanly outside the air off his left but always going away from goal for a goal kick 1-0 Liverpool sloppy wasn't it from Chiquiri to give that simple pass away to allow Barcelona to attack that back four Liverpool particularly that man Messi with his quick feet Liverpool have never lost a home leg in a European Cup semi-final they've won eight and they've drawn two they're leading here by a goal to nil but as it stands they'll still be going out of the competition they need to summon up two more goals without any reply from Barcelona Oregi near side the left just outside the penalty area Vidal makes the challenge it's the corner kick for Liverpool in stoppage time he's been impressive as well you know Oregi he's led the line very well Pierce his touch has been good he's brought people into the game got his court his team another corner corner kick then for Liverpool that Milner will take Matty and Fabinho were in there headed away by Suarez at the near post Chiquiri's head at inadvertently will go towards Jordi Alba up towards the halfway line on the left hand side back inside to Coutinho Suarez plotting on ahead of him Messi waits Messi's ball Black stays down Alisson makes the save to keep out Jordi Alba another good save from Alisson that's his third of his first half corner for Liverpool wasn't it that's again Barcelona that was the the left back furthest forward this time with a one-on-one we're out with Alisson good save and there is the halftime whistle for what has been a breathless first half where Liverpool still have hope but still have work to do they made the perfect start where the Oregis goal after seven minutes but Alisson has denied Barcelona on three occasions it has been a terrific first half and at the break it's Liverpool one Barcelona nil people enjoying this on social media remember you can get in touch with us 85058 on the text at five live sport on social media or you can use the hashtag BBC football Fabian on Twitter said this time reminds me a lot of Barca Bayern in 2015 both teams classy small details decide and probably in a way goal will kill a very courageous second leg David Wallace says I'm not much of a football fan I'm 80 years old and house-bound I've never even been to Liverpool but I'm caught up in the sheer emotion of this the crowd is stirring the fans are marvellous it feels more like a national event than a local one and Luis Suarez getting special mention as you'd imagine Magnus said Luis Suarez has to be one of the most unlikeable players in modern football history London money has probably got it just about on the money when he said Suarez is a wonderful player provided he's on your side and we can talk about him in a second the player I want to ask you about Alan is Sadio Mane how many positions do you reckon he's covered in that first half he's been absolutely everywhere they don't know how to handle him they don't know whether to go tight on him or whether just to where to to drop deep and let him get that ball but when they're doing that he's causing them all sorts of problems and early on in the game when we were having the long balls from from Matipo or from van Dijk over the top he was running in behind and they still couldn't handle them and also a Rigi I think a Rigi's been right handful and the right nuisance for for the Barcelona defenders he's holed up players being excellent he's he's full of running full of energy full of confidence because of obviously that goal and tell us about the goal tell us how Liverpool went ahead in this time well Henderson wasn't it that the keeper he just managed to get his hand to it wasn't strong enough but a Rigi following it up as all good centre forward should do and he's been left with it with a tap at him what an ideal start it was for Liverpool because the crowd were up for it Liverpool went and De Man closed that Barcelona back four down went after them and they got the reward for it in a different way but similarly to it the new camp Liverpool have had their opportunities in this game however we've seen that Barcelona can still hurt them it's not by any means in in Liverpool's hands this this time but Barcelona are not going to change the way they play they want to score a goal I mean in the last minute of the half there you've got their left back with a one-on-one with the goalkeeper when they have the break from a corner you've got Pekier running forward he's the furthest man forward in the centre forward position so that tells you that they're not going to sit back they want to attack they still want to get the ball and they want to get that goal Liverpool then one nil up at the break against Barcelona three one down though on aggregate with it all to do in the second half after a thrilling first half here at Anfield we'll bring you that very shortly now though it's time for the BBC News with Nick Hatfield on digital BBC sounds smart speaker and online this is BBC radio 5 live good evening at

and BBC sounds available to download now everywhere this is five live sport with Kelly Cates and five live sport comes to you live from anfield this evening where Liverpool are one nil up against Barcelona on the night three won down on aggregate after a thrilling first half and the second half still to come in this game top them away at iAX on wednesday night in their champions league semi-final second leg they have it all to do they trail one nil after the first leg much tighter than this one we've got full commentary of this match on five live sport from eight o'clock with our football correspondent John Murray uh John you're in Amsterdam right now we spoke to Chris Sutton he'll be with you tomorrow night he said he's not yet managed to go out and sample any of the city so where did we find you this evening yes thanks Kelly welcome back to Amsterdam we're actually not too far away from the Johan Cruyff arena itself just on the south side of the city the other side of the Amstel park and the A2 motorway and Chris Sutton is here with me Chris who played in the Johan Cruyff arena it was just to play an old Amsterdam arena in those days against a very good iAX side in the champions league qualifiers Chris happy memories yeah it's got a brilliant goal John you obviously didn't know that because i'm sure you would have said but we know he beat a good young iAX team and you know we we talk about this iAX team now who are a step up from you know they had the likes of van der Vart a ibra a young ibra was there so no they were a good team back then different Ketler fish now though absolutely wonderful team and i mean this would this would be an absolute fairy tale story you know if iX could go all the way i think i was reading last season in the champions league they got knocked out in in the qualifying round against Nice and they didn't even get into the Europa League i think Rosenberg beat them in in the Europa qualifier so it tells you in such a short space of time you know how they have improved and they've been the story of this season so far but can they see it through yeah well even this season they started out in this competition on the 25th of July and here they are one match away from the final but as far as Tottenham are concerned there are more injury worries there's no Davenson Sanchez here he's the latest one to join the injury list obviously no Harry Kane Serge Aurier is not here Eric Lamella is here he's been able to train and as for Jan Fautongan after he took that clattering last week he is going to be involved and Mauricio Pochettino the Tottenham manager explained to us that he will be wearing a face mask but this is what he had to say about Jan Fautongan's condition today he didn't suffer nothing wrong more than he cut in his nose it's no more than than that it's a lot of player playing play and keep playing with the same situation you know and it's not a big issue wasn't a big issue if tomorrow is fit and we believe that that we want to give the possibility to play i think it's ready to play it's not a problem i think he don't need a mask but it's not a it wasn't a big issue so it looks as though Jan Fautongan is going to be involved no question about that it would seem uh and highly significantly from a Tottenham point of view Son Hyeong-min is able to play having missed the first leg through suspension yeah i think in terms of Son he was missed badly uh you know in that first leg he's such a versatile player uh you know a goal scorer a real threat so that's a massive boost for Spurs and Fautongan of course when i have to say when uh you know when he nearly collapsed last week you know coming off the pitch and i thought you know that that's him done is not going to make this leg but um you know they've obviously made the decision um you know it's good to see he is okay and is an experienced player and they will need all his experience uh tomorrow night Maurizio Pochettino said uh today that he felt that Ajax in the first 30 minutes of the first leg were very very good he said they were dynamic they had energy he said our approach was bad and he talked today about how in the second leg here they need to play with more freedom do you do you think that he will have worked out a way to win this match and get through yes i look you know i think he talked about the lack of intensity in the first uh game but i actually thought Pochettino's uh Maurizio Pochettino's tactics he got them wrong uh with the three at the back when he changed Tottenham were a lot more comfortable so Soco uh came on and had a really strong game Tottenham are still well in this time it's it's half time they're a they're a goal behind we know they have goals uh in this team and you know the pressure's off in many respects unless there's a miracle uh you know at the weekend Tottenham have secured their champions league spot anyway so it's all it's all in they have to go all in now have a listen to this this was a little a little bit bizarre really in the in the media conference this afternoon when Maurizio Pochettino was asked how it would feel if he were to win the champions league this season it should be fantastic no close five-year chapter and go home was that a joke or it's not a joke why sorry that that makes it sound like you would maybe leave Tottenham if you won the champions league that that would be your work done yes or maybe i work with Daniel setting you know working in different for sure to win the champion league with Tottenham in the circumstance this season maybe i need to think a little bit maybe to do something different in the future so that was all a little bit strange Chris and i must say what we've done there is edit together all the pertinent points it was it was all sort of said over a period of time Maurizio Pochettino was smiling at one stage hence the question from Matt Law as the Daily Telegraph there about whether he was joking it was a little bit difficult to know what exactly he was talking about yeah i mean my reading of that and you were there of course and could see his you know his his facial expressions this that and the other my reading of that was his him saying i couldn't better this this season with this spurs team you know they have been stretched they didn't bring players in in the summer this would be the absolute pinnacle uh that's the way i read it you know i don't think you'll be going anywhere if they win the champions league i think you think about building champions league first and the premier league well they've got to win the semi-final first of all and we'll see if they're able to do that the two of us will bring you commentary tomorrow night on five live here from amsterdam looking forward to that john thank you very much to chris as well really interesting comments there from Maurizio Pochettino plenty of time to discuss them between now and eight o'clock kickoff tomorrow all the build up from seven o'clock on five live sport we're here at anthilver libertola one nil up at the break against barcelona three one down of course on aggregate in the other sports stories this evening england coach trevor bales says alex hails can come back stronger and better than ever after being removed from their world cup squad for an off-the-field incident test much special has commentary of england's first odio with pakistan tomorrow from 1245 israel fallow has been found guilty of breaching ruck the australia's code of conduct in his controversial social media posts a decision is yet to be made on his punishment england and north hampton forward james haskell will retire at the end of the season britain jenna conter and carl edmund are both out of the madrid open but roger federer defeated risha gaskey 6263 in his first clay court match in three years alex here a part of our commentary team at anfield this evening we talked about the positives for libertola the fact that they are a goal up at halftime and the threat that barcelona have posed in the first half and could continue to pose in the second half in terms of negatives for libertola and concerns for joggencliffe at halftime duncan alexander of optofame tweeted shakiri answering the age old question could a stoke player do it on a mild Tuesday night against messy is he liverpool's weak link this evening he looked tired in the last 10 or 15 minutes he gave away two or three sloppy balls which barcelona could have punished liverpool um so that wouldn't surprise me um that if he wanted if he didn't come out at halftime or two if he was going to be another 10 or 15 minutes on the pitch then it would be a change it looks as though genie winaldum is just taking on fluid he's just getting some last minute instructions he's sitting on the bench along with one of the coaching staff here at liverpool so it could be that he makes an appearance in the second half the barcelona players are already out as they make their way over to the top end of anfield they're lining up their goalkeeper test steg and making his way between the sticks as he gets a round of applause from those liverpool fans in the coffin the liverpool players now making their way out of the tunnel shakiri is out with them so let's find out if there have been any changes ahead of the second half with your commentary team valentira and leon denis well shakiri is out there henderson is out there i wondered if henderson's knee injury that he picked up that knock was not going to make him come out for the second half with vinaldom stripped and ready for action the player who hasn't come out is robertson so millner looks like he's going to fill in at left back for vinaldom to replace robertson so that is indeed the liverpool change so andrew robertson unable to start the second half as liverpool now with half allison in goal a back four of alexander arnold matty van dyke and millner and midfield of fabinho vinaldom and henderson with shakiri orighi and marne basalona are unchanged to steggen in goal sergio roberto gerard pique clement longlake geordie alba midfield of vedal buskets and racquetich mesi swarez and cotino we're back underway for the second half where liverpool lead by a goal to nil they trail three one on aggregate and liverpool in all red are attacking as we look in the main stand from left to right therefore they are attacking the cop end as alexander arnold will switch play out to millner now playing as a left back the versatile millner forward to marne marne back with millner yogan clock yesterday was talking about we will give it a try let's take it step by step well if the first 45 minutes are a big step they now need to build on it as the cross comes in from the left hand side and it goes behind for a corner kick and liverpool as we all know have produced some remarkable comebacks in the second half three goals in a six minute spell in istanbul three goals in the last 26 minutes in that epic tie against borussia dorpland they require two in the next 45 without any reply from basalona to take us to extra time corner kick shakiri to take it didn't beat the first man comes out to van dyke swings his left foot at that basalona in their luminous shirts will break from right to left and it's dealt with by henderson to prevent for catino get the ball first out for a basalona throw allen shearer of norfamino nor salam now nor robertson this would be incredible wouldn't it from liverpool if there were two to get through this i was listening to the commentary with mart lawrence and john Murray on the way back from mollini at the weekend and john was talking to laura just saying if liverpool were to do it and mart lawrence and said it would be the greatest ever european comeback the salad what 26 goals for mino with his 16 missing 42 goals worthy also the the work rate that for mino does as well off the ball and they have two huge losses for this liverpool side and now without robertson they will hope that he's okay to recover for that final game of the season against wolves at the weekend but this is the champions league and the ball is threaded through to chicory chicory on the right hand side left-footed cross vinaldo was waiting and it was just taken off his head by surja roberto out of play it goes liverpool want to take the throw quickly on the left hand side milner to fabinho back with van dyke every outfield player is in the bar salon a half away towards our right hand side milner they had to produce the perfect performance and gain the perfect result they lead by a goal to nil milner with a throw manne ubiquitous manne just loses his footing and cleared then by pk towering header by van dyke and it runs away from a reagan out of play for a throw it's good play from chicory on this right hand side he just cuts back on his left and he picks his head up and he looks at the far post sees wine aldem there and it just didn't have enough on the cross to reach him headed forward by milner busket slides into that matip they will get there first and brings the ball forward almost runs into trouble plays it back fabinho out to milner milner now's a left back remember back inside to fabinho 10 yards forward of the center circle chips it out towards a reagan prevented from reaching to it by sergio reberto gives the ball away the referee's definitely not a homer is he the way that he keeps on giving the decisions to basalona and that will be a free kick to basalona over on that far side only twice in a european cup semifinal has a team squandered a three goal advantage panathanaikos in 71 when they lost 4-1 to red star belgray sorry red panathanaikos overcame red star belgray they lost 4-1 but won the second leg 3-0 and basalona themselves actually against gothenberg in 86 they lost the first leg 3-0 when the second leg by the same score line and went through on a penalty shootout history not on liverpool side the odds firmly stacks against liverpool but certainly on the evidence of what we've seen so far and giving it a damn fine go ball played forward by vijnaldum marney takes it on into the penalty area and it's just taken away from him by sergio reberto for a corner kick never really in full control no he's made an instant impact hasn't he vijnaldum picking the ball up there picking his head up looking at marney who was 20 25 yards ahead of him but he just couldn't get that ball under control try to take it on his thigh which then gave the defender time to come and tow poker away for another corner it's been a thrilling second leg of this champions league semi-final liverpool wants a second goal in comes the corner kick being out by the goalkeeper sishneggen from van dyke who just hooked his left leg around it on the edge of the six-yard box and to shag it was straight at him somehow swatted the ball away well it was alexander arnold this time with a ball in whips it in van dyke too strong i think it was for picking he just flicks his leg around it back heel straight at the goalkeeper anywhere else it would have been interesting barcelona now on the attack swar is inside the penalty area another good save from allison swar is against his former club excellent strong wrist by allison who was down and to make the save it's his fourth crucial save of this terrific second semi-final brilliant from barcelona there the way they hit them on the the counter attack and swar is running in behind one on one from a tight angle but what another impressive save from allison he is doing his bit you don't need to be reminded of the significance of a barcelona goal racquetich strokes the ball back to tishneggen buskets collects the ball off pk out towards albert mix it on the inside of henderson runs into a bit of trouble he might have just caught a high foot there from chiciri on the hip and the turkish referee kinect chicir gives the free kick to to barcelona just because of andate went up for that corner he couldn't get back in time when he finds himself in between milner running in behind milner but it was a bit of a tight angle but nevertheless still a good save buskets forward voice of alan shear with us on bbc radio five live our commentary is also on bbc radio merseyside tonight as jordie albert the left back plays it back messy strikes for binho comes back to messy sir shea reberto midway through the liver paul har buskets goes square fractionally backward of square for racquetich plays it forward albert volleys over the cross from the left hand side headed away by van dyke headed further clear by vijnaldum manne almost like a one-man crusade from saudiomane and he will get a free kick because it was delivered handball by racquetich again so good from manne they hold up here the strength to hold racquetich off so he has to foul him yellow card he has been magnificent as an iman tonight he has certainly stepped up to the plate in the absence of salah and for nino as the red and white scarves are being swirled around the heads from the libert paul supporters inside anfield their side lead by a golden ill they trail three one on aggregate we're on the red button tonight we're also on the bbc sport website and the bbc i player as well as radio five live and radio mercy side manne in essential position out to alexander arnold heads it forward but henderson had vacated that space alexander arnold wins the ball back cross takes an inflection into here well we mentioned the strength of alexander arnold down the right hand side he goes he looks up he picks his head up in that white position there's no one in there so he drags the ball forward under five yards then picks out winaldum in the box he does pick him out on that penalty spot what a finish winaldum he's made such a massive impact in this game second half do you believe inside anfield everybody wearing red and white believes the scars now are being swelled around their heads because they lead by two goals to nil and we are only in the ninth minute of the second half such clever play from alexander arnold because he picks his there's no one in there so he can't put it in there and he waits and he waits again until someone's there until he can pick them out and that's someone wonaldum running in there back of the net as a matter of course it will be checked by var that is why we are yet to restart khanate shakir who by the way was the referee when manchester city played tottenham in that epic tie last time around so he knows all about var plays back underway liverpool 2 nil there's always that anxious weight isn't there here we go again listen to anfield now there is hope now there is bully it's coursing through the veins of everybody a reagey turns inside the penalty area delivers the cross chiciri back to miller on the left hand side miller plays the ball to chiciri chiciri with a cross there simply unbelievable by now again liverpool have overturned a three goal deficit they wiped it out the brilliant barcelona are now back level pegging and liverpool are threatening to do the impossible three nil look at anfield what a ball in this time from that left hand side who is it again that man why now the water header what a run what a goal incredible oh pinch yourselves unbelievable into malan 65 sanatiae in 77 olympia cos chelsea barushia dormand this would top the lot what a header what a crossing from chiciri on that left hand side which we thought he might have been one of the changes in half time but a magnificent cross just like two minutes earlier alexander anil did from the other side what an atmosphere this is liverpool three barcelona nil if it stays like this we're going to extra time liverpool forget extra time liverpool are going to win it in the 90 minutes the last time that barcelona lost again three nil was when they squandered a three goal advantage to roma last season in the champions league that was last april just take a breath well well well what is it about anfield alexander anil's manne is there manne still battling for the ball what is it about second half performances because barcelona alan shearer are absolutely rattled two minutes before that we've got to give a mention to alexander again to keep them in the game with that special save van dyke van dyke still coming van dyke all the interception by catino to messy well even if barcelona were to score the liverpool players have summoned up a performance of a beautiful failure but forget failure they're wanting for it to be a dramatic success head into the cross and to stegel will gather it in because i don't think from the failure is in the the vocabulary of these liverpool players what was here about yogan clop and his program notes this liverpool never stops this liverpool never quits we don't do if only well what an effort from every single player proud of playing their part as well also just listen to the atmosphere and feels at its awesome best geordie alba still the discipline is required still the concentration not to give barcelona the goal rackett itch geordie alba left hand side messier runs away from him even looked ordinary that alan just for once nothing ordinary about this game tonight is it oh bold out by alexander by dalton 54 and 56 with those two rapid fire goals and still you think of daugther and it was three goals in the last 26 minutes three goals and a six minute blitz in istanbul we are now on level terms and liverpool have produced one of the great european performances as sonado comes on to replace catino so it's a right back for catino so secio reberto would go a little bit further forward catino on his return to anfield has made no impact if you can still hear me this is bivy's t radio five live and bivy's t radio mercy side and the reason that anfield is rocking the way it is is that they lead by three goals to know this place is brilliant now listen to it what an atmosphere they're protecting along and beaten run in european competition of 21 games going back some five years but the odds were so heavily stacked against them their forward line depleted but they have spirit they have heart they have believed they have character in abundance and they are showing it and basa loner at the minute do not have an answer their performance last week didn't warrant a three goal defeat they were unlucky not to get the away goal but undeterred they have produced something very very special in these 61 minutes and who knows what lies ahead in the next 29 of normal time of regulation 90 because if it stays like this we're going into extra time is it always like this on the radio only with you mr. sheeran only with you van dyke henderson right hand side henderson with a cross headed away by pk here is the reagan battling for the ball alexander arnold to miller the crowd urge liverpool on and marne can't keep the ball in play it's like barcelona don't know how to defend corners crosses coming in into the box no one prepared to to go and head it yes they're very good crosses and difficult to defend well you've still got to pick up people liverpool three barcelona nil vijnaldum coming on off the bench with two goals in the space of three minutes in the second half chiciri barcelona in the last two champions league campaigns have lost second legs by three goals to nil as they've exited the competition they haven't reached the semi finals since four years ago and they're losing three nil a night and liverpool now have a free kick alexander arnold places the ball down liverpool are attacking the cop end they're playing from left to right it'll be alexander arnold with the out swinger or the in-swinger from the left foot of chiciri who runs over the ball alexander arnold the delivery headed away by raketitch barcelona at the minute they're rocking they are rocking firmly on the back foot and so is anfield 63 minutes play or reek he just couldn't control the ball it runs out someda will want to take it yurkin clock when he was manager of brussia dormant in 2014 lost a tie against real madrid in the first leg by three goals to nil his team left him feeling very very proud as they fell short they won the second leg by two goals to nil this liverpool side have gone one better they lead three nil on the night we could have extra time we could have the unexpected the last time that barcelona lost four nil was to paris tange man remarkably they overturned that first leg defeat in the french capital it could be less shell shocks here on merseyside raketitch loses the ball that will win a throw off the legs of chiciri still liverpool not giving barcelona a second on the ball a work rate has been phenomenal liverpool have won 13 of 27 ua for ties when they've lost the away leg first but they lost both when they had been beaten three nil paris tange man in the european cup semifinal and then strazbo the following season in the ua for cup they fell just short that night on both of those occasions by two goals to nil they don't look like falling short tonight as they leave three nil an extra time is on the horizon kiko on that far side sonado challenge by millner they've left everything out there as we see a shot of steven gerard the rangers manager in the stands here in anfield and liverpool oh they believe they came with hopes they came with dreams they could yet be realized there was a hundred and twenty two seconds between the two vinaldin goals as henderson wins the ball it runs loose vinaldin then just over runs it and vidal to busquets to messi hardly mentioned messi in the second half he holds off the bigno messi then is stopped by ermatip that'll be a yellow card that'll be a free kick and meet at matip his books i think that's what you call a good foul because messi was running through went past one then two then three he'd have been into the 18 yard box in another five yards time so you have to bring him down and what 30 yards out central position very similar is that where you're going i was just thinking does lightning strike twice suarez with his hands on hips having a word with for vinho liverpool have everybody back that's the one thing that liverpool have to guard against messi places the ball down the booze and whistles intrepidation everybody knows what messi is capable of basalona if ever there was a time for some messy magic it's now but it is just a shade over 30 yards out but we know that he's scored from this position before liverpool lead 3-0 on the night messi's eyeing it up it's a direct free kick allison waits in the centre of his goal messi hits the wall the loose ball will run behind and millman will volley the ball away but it will go behind for a corner kick wall stood strong did its job absorbing captivating thrilling mesmerizing use any words you like to sum up what this second leg has been like here at anfield it's been another special night regardless of the outcome corner kick taken short worked into rackettitch popped back up messi brings the ball down and saved by allison in his near post well worked by basalona well worked wasn't it the ball comes out to the edge of the 18 yard box messi continues his run from the corner and it's another decent sear from the goalkeeper allison i reckon that's the fifth fine save that allison has made the fifth important save that allison has made the fifth important save to deny basalona because one goal from basalona and liverpool then would require five corner kick taken by basalona towards the far post and it goes away from suarez and in front of their silent traveling support liverpool have a goal kick that they want to take quickly bbc radio five line exclusive commentary here from anfield with bbc radio merseyside we're on the red button we're on the bbc sport website we're on the i player tomorrow night we're in amsterdam and if that game is anywhere near as thrilling as this then we're in for another treat of our second night of live european football followed by arsenal in valencia on thursday as manne picks up on the ball goes on the outside keeps the ball in plays it away headed clear by pk runs out of play for a throw for liverpool left hand side he just went past buskets with ease didn't he the little step over got to the byline there was only one person in the box saw this time chicory from the throw manne loses out and dyke forward looks to head it out towards the left hand side cut out though by basalona and seziora beto played back buskets forward ball we are midway through the second half and liverpool lead by three golsden hill on the night for what has been an epic night at anfield and it's still not over boy is this tie still not over but rackett it drills the ball out to geordie albert brings it down off the chest outside of the left boot played forward cut out by liverpool for benio running forward vine alton strokes it across towards millner back with vine alton once again plays it forward as millner advances on that left touch line back with vine alton the liverpool support has been unwavering throughout and once again they will raise their voices as they raise their red and white scarves above their heads as the ball is played out to millner and the cross comes in couldn't get their a reeking picked up by tischtegen allen that's millner forward this time instead of whipping it in with that left foot he chooses to come back and do it with the with the right oh just two yards too quick for a reeking then straight into the goalkeeper basalona have only failed to score on five occasions this season two of them have appeared recently when they played their youngest starting 11 in 24 years against us in between manches united and then at the weekend when they changed the entire 11 against celto vego the celto vego inflicted their first defeat in 24 against basalona and still liverpool claws down still have got the press then it's a wonderful ball out to that left hand side for millner again and he's midway through the basalona half inside to vijnaldum vijnaldum to manne manne back to millner they've been magnificent these liverpool players as that manne just runs back there is a control about liverpool's play now that they have that third goal there isn't that urgency now that they have levelled the tie overall because we are levelled on aggregate at three a piece van dyke back to allison allison will play it forward all in gray and his pass drifts out of play for a basalona throw 18 and a bit minutes remain this someda right hand side back with buskets now it's on a ninth edge allen scherer oh it's so tight isn't it can go either way with the ability that they have still going forward someda is forward on the right down by the corner flag he's got some support from sergio deberto back to someda the substitute to buskets buskets runs in field rackettage now every liverpool player is back behind the ball they're playing from left to right rackettage once again lengley he plays it out towards albert and then van dyke has played it away from suarez and allison was unable to keep the ball in play offside offside though against suarez free kick which gets a bigger cheer just because it's suarez there's going to be another change for for basalona we're going to be seeing arthur coming on the brazilian midfielder so he's going to be coming on for another change made by Ernesto valverde the basalona coach he's only lost 10 of his 115 games fine record since he took charge however hopes of a treble are in jeopardy by this liverpool side who just do not know when to stop when to give up they just do not throw the towel in manchester city will testify to that manchester city 95 points liverpool 94 in the premier league but the players have carried out the message from yergen klopp yesterday to an absolute team they've given it a try as now they have some defending to do geordie albert racket itch mess he plays it forward dealt with by mattie henderson the next goal could be the deciding goal as we have 16 minutes remaining he's been relentless up and down this left hand side as well as in the alber yeah well it's uh gonna be vedal vedal who comes off so like for like with the brazilian midfielder replacing the experienced chilean he looks absolutely shattered walking off that pitch because he's had the run around in there so arthur is on just think as well if you think about how much energy has been expended by both sets of players out here in this scintillating time in barcelona's players didn't play at the weekend though no they didn't made the 11 changes but if they did have to go for extra time and summon up another 30 minutes to steggen we're about to enter the last quarter of an hour of the regulation 90 and it's it's in the balance it's on a knife edge liable lead 3-0 on the night 3-3 on aggregate manne keeps the ball in play then he's pulled back sonado that'll be a free kick to liable and a yellow card to the barcelona substitute nelson sonado shown yellow no surprise again that manne working his socks off track tracking back to win that ball back then trying to get into the final third and he's off again free kick taken too quickly he really has been so impressed this evening he's led from the front barcelona the only undefeated side left in this season's competition are going to suffer their first defeat they've previously won eight and drawn three and they're about to face another ball whipped into the box as the free kick is taken short millner comes in then from distance from alexander arnold off his right foot always on the rise as it goes over the crossbar and into the cop i'm surprised at that with the with the problems they've caused them with balls into the box today they've got an opportunity to whip it in they've got van dyke forward and the and the choose to go short and let Trent have a shot from 30 35 yards out but you couldn't call it now could you no can go either way just been incredible what a night 14 minutes remain henderson's forward ball stopped by albert played forward then by lengley he was part actually of the severe side that came back from liverpool in the champions league a couple of seasons ago when liverpool with three nil up in civill and ended up drawing three three role reversal time liverpool have produced a comeback this time chicciri stabs it forward to a reagan did he have his legs taken away from him from lengley the referee says no buskets pk someda the right back is over the halfway line buskets back with arthur 13 minutes of normal time remained liverpool would gladly have taken extra time at the start of play here is Sergio Roberto geordie albert left corner of the penalty area rolls it in dealt with by matty they've negated the threat of messian suarez particularly in this second half liverpool however have still got to be so vigilant as lengley will play the ball forward they've just got to try and keep the pace up liverpool because you just feel as if it can sense it that barcelona just slowly coming back into it having a little bit more possession if liverpool can keep that pace up very difficult i know but that's their best opportunity here is chicciri alexander anald waits right hand side level the penalty area almost at walking pace chicciri then in field to henderson five live and radio mercy side with 12 minutes of normal time remaining extra time now does loom large alexander anald up against sergio Roberto and wins the corner he edged him he took him right to the byline and then off his knees wins the corner kick very clever play he knows that he's standing in front and he's blocking him oh my word how clever trend alexander anald we talked about crosses they go to sleep he tips everyone he whips in a reeky there's no one around him three shots six yards out wow what's it him the craft the ingenuity of alexander anald to walk away from the corner kick and then playing in towards a reeky and barcelona were caught napping and liverpool lead by four goals to three they're going to sleep they've turned their back on the corner they've just let him put it in before they realize it's too late in the back of the net the greatest european comeback ever is now a possibility liverpool four barcelona nil and barcelona now have to score in the next 10 minutes racketed choff malcom's gonna replace him barcelona the mighty messy the brilliant barcelona humbled unless they can produce something in the next 10 minutes liverpool defined belief here a depleted liverpool forward line we're talking about crosses into the box about them not being able to defend them they turn off they turn the back is the champions league semi-final no one wanted to face the ball brilliant from alexander anald too clever for them Gomez is going to be coming on for liverpool forget extra time liverpool now a dreaming of the final remarkable incredible astonishing none of the words do it justice here at anfield we are seeing one of the great european performances the pressure the work rate the stamina the desire from every single liverpool player has been incredible here is messy messy running forward loses the ball cleared away he said let's make it a celebration with loans and legs and the liverpool supporters now are doing their bit to try and carry liverpool over the line someda with a cross right hand side here cleared away by shakiri it's only been done twice before that a three-goal deficit in the semi-final overturned 71 and 86 liverpool are adding their own place in european history fine alden excellent forward orighy orighy with a cross comes out now to shakiri shakiri waits it will be the greatest liverpool night that ever experienced alizander anald wins the corner handball handball it will be a free kick against jordy albert guess where this is going to go this time i'm struggling to catch my breath it's a free kick shakiri is going to come off joko les is going to replace it it's a defensive substitution by urgen plot you do not blame him liverpool for basalona nil but orighy's down in the far corner there so they're just reluctant to make it at this moment in time everybody has put in a shift in red for the fans have played their part as well the goalkeeper when he's had to be relied on he's made four or five superb saves but the pressure and the closing down and the energy that these liverpool pool players have shown has been staggering it is unbelievable that's almost lost the words just in a shot of a basalona supporter who cannot believe it he's buried his head in his hands it's a really a regal be suffering from cramp over on that far side but they've left everything out there but the manner of the fourth goal as well you've got to admire liverpool's craft their ingenuity they're too clever for them you're too bright for them they stayed alive basalona look dead on the feet then they're all turned their back they wanted to rest and alexander arnold was having none of it he wanted to get the ball back into play because they were under pressure he did he picked his head up and he whipped it in and orighy's standing still no one within five or six yards of him on the six yard line defending a corner it's incredible listen to the noise inside anfield it's a night that will live with every liverpool supporter for as long as they live a red and white checkered flag flies in the cock red and white scars being swirled around the heads as arigy is unable to continue so joe gomez was going to replace shakiri but shakiri will stay out there and it will be diva koree g diva koree g who set liverpool on their way with a perfect start after seven minutes diva koree g with potentially the winning goal 11 minutes from time diva koree g who's only started four occasions in his previous 17 appearances this season will go down as a liverpool legend you talk about david fairclub against sanateen in 77 diva koree g has created his place in history for liverpool in 2019 along with vine alden as the free kick is taken and swept in liverpool lead by four goal stonyll nilner plays the ball in flag stays down shakiri with a header over the top clever ball in from millner this time with his left foot mani and shakiri at the far post just too long for mani and shakiri with a free header put it over the bar well when he was asked yesterday he might have been from juliet fairington actually in the press conference you know do you have any hope and he said there is hope and it's football but then he tempered it with a dose of realism when he said we have well without two of the world's best strikers who are not available so we'll give it a try we have to score but we also have to deny barcelona from scoring liverpool have scored four times and the mighty barcelona have been denied and we are now four minutes away from 90 minutes there will be no extra time now that is no longer on the cards that's been taken off the table that's not possible so liverpool are going through unless barcelona can break their hearts four nil to liverpool the ball played out towards somedo the booze and whistles will tell you that liverpool are not in possession this is arthur the brazilian plays it out towards somedo mistake by pique every outfield player is in the liverpool half barcelona are attacking the anfield road end they play from right to left the booze and the whistles grow reaching a crescendo messi's now on the ball matti's to close him down messy square and short buskets plays it forward ball played out cross come he's going to come in from geordie alba stopped by alexander arnold alexander arnold will bring the ball away barcelona are back in possession played out towards somedo barcelona now threatening liverpool have everybody back barmane pique joins the attack liverpool with a time ticking away against barcelona cross from somedo alice and what governor ball in it's exactly what liverpool want long balls into the box for van dyke if he's there this time it's alexand too much height on it he collects it with ease two and a half minutes remain liverpool are going to make another change and the change that is going to be made is daniel storage who is going to be coming on barcelona play the ball forward somedos after it go must tries to took him back somedo gets away pulls the ball back van dyke steps forward and van dyke deals with it millner now will clear over on that far side it's a long clearance nobody inside anfield is going anywhere i doubt anybody listening to five live already on mursy side is turning off just quite yet as barcelona come forward looking for a goal here is messy suarez helps it on malcom inside the penalty area chips the ball forward runs off the head of Gomez and millner will clear surely mill the weights runs the ball down the touch line and it will be a barcelona throw over on that far side and we have under 90 seconds remaining of normal time defend them incredibly well every single man behind the ball doing their bit now under huge pressure from this barcelona team well liverpool supporters are up and out of their feet as the ball is headed away by van dyke because they are close they are close to producing what was deemed by many is almost the impossible task leading liver barcelona by four goals to kneel we're inside the last 60 seconds of normal time storage is going to be coming on and it's chiciri who is coming off did a lot better second off chiciri a lot better got on the ball caused problems whipping balls into the box much better second off than he was first off messy produced the magic in the new camp liverpool as a collective have produced their own magic here on mursy side jürgen klopp embraces chiciri it's all eyes on the fourth official how much added on time there will be five minutes added on time which we're now into liverpool for barcelona nil five more minutes to endure five more minutes for barcelona to conjure up something otherwise they're heading out what a half he's at as well why now them closing down goals he's been everywhere this second off Arthur just outside the center circle some aid on the right hand side these five minutes will seem like an eternity for liverpool marnay still going he's helping the ball back storage plays the ball forward marnay will go down towards the corner flag will he left side of the penalty area plays it to henderson henderson back to marnay marnay denied by the goalkeeper tried to scoop it over just outside incredible wasn't it little one two i thought henderson was just going to leave the ball for storage running behind him then but he didn't he flipped it back into marnay who was offside but it was a late flag pk back with buskets four and a bit minutes remain ball played forward to geordie albert albert with a cross pk's there melcom sergio ribato tried to drag it into the path of nesay and liverpool with milner will hang on to the ball milner with a diagonal ball out towards marnay the composure for the cushion header back to alexander arnold henderson doesn't have the energy to chase that he's out on his feet geord and henderson the driving force from midfield three minutes about it on time remain liable for basalona nil basalona will come again they have to come again they're going out descending heroically here liverpool every single one of them behind the ball now having to work having to track back having to pick up in the box here is melcom left corner of the penalty area under pressure from alexander arnold the liverpool support now with the anthem if you'll never walk alone to try and see liverpool over the line ball played forward two and a bit minutes remain basalona with busquets into the penalty area headed away by alexander arnold busquets back with basalona once more but they can't get past this liverpool side who are digging deep they're being resolute and there is fadinho to break up the play and then fadinho goes down that'll be a free kick liverpool and a free kick just outside the centre circle Alan sheeran great anticipation from fadinho he wins that ball off line on messy he's strong he's too quick for them and again running into that basalona defence wins the foul for his team he will stay down he will ease up the seconds do you believe what you're witnessing it's just been incredible the atmosphere from the start of the game then the players responded by putting that performance in getting that goal early in the game and they've just got bigger they've got better they've had to make changes substitutions it hasn't affected them at all it's improved them it's been staggering night liverpool for basalona nil and by my watch we're inside the last 60 seconds at the minimum of five to be added on five live and radio mercy side when the whistle blows from the turkish referee you will not hear me speak you will probably not even hear yourself think wherever you are whether you're on mercy side or beyond because the cheers and the celebrations will be absolutely definitely inside anfield because liverpool are heading to another champions league final and they shall not be moved the free kick is taken short on the far side two goals from arigat there is the full-time whistle liverpool for basalona nil wild wild celebration it has been a monumental effort on mercy side it is the greatest ever european comeback it is an unforgettable night and liverpool would you believe a pungal the brilliant basalona and the mighty messy in the most astonishing of circumstances i have never seen anything like this i've played it and feel when it's been a superb atmosphere this is something different this is special from the from the whistle every single player the fans the manager everyone be very proud because you've witnessed something special tonight it's been incredible from all the players the goals the atmosphere the decisions that went forward against them the players they had to play without then robert's in off at halftime wow the basalona supporters are actually applauding the basalona fans are applauding because they realize they acknowledge the effort that these liverpool players have put in and the liverpool players amidst the wild celebrations are acknowledging the cop the supporters every single one of them is on their feet kelly you will know for generations they talked about melanne 65 san etienne in 77 olympiac chelsea endowment this tops the lot this has been a night truly to save it alice shira it's your job to explain what just happened i've run out of words kelly i can't i've never seen anything like it as i said i've played here i've been fortunate to to have some unbelievable results here i'm performed so i've never seen anfield like this i've never seen the fans so excited driving their players forward from start to finish it has just been relentless it's been incredible was it down to the way that those players played or was this just one of those nights that occasionally rarely only three times now in european cup history happened well they they showed their intent right from the off they thought you know what if we're going to go out tonight we're going to go out fighting we're going to go out giving it an unbelievable go and that's what they did they went to close down there was no space for any of those basalona players and we're talking about busket we're talking about piki we're talking about swarez about the best player that i've ever seen messy they couldn't handle it tonight they couldn't handle the pressure that they were under that they were being put under the stadium an answer here at anfield and the man called george septon who's been here since the days of the 60s and shankley's both standing on the terrace and in that booth where he operates the music from as time this song absolutely perfectly alan we could go through and we will take some of this a little bit later but we could go through that Liverpool team and pick out performances how about diva karee and his ability to just get those all important goals well he he's playing against jerobe piki and his whole up play he's running in behind he's finishing he's obviously taking great confidence from that early goal that he got but he ran them absolutely ragged they couldn't handle him superb he was so my And while they take a dip before they go again, there's Anfield crowd right in front of the Cop. The Liverpool squad, the Liverpool backroom staff are standing arm in arm in a line in front of them. The ones on the end have their arms aloft as they join in with the famous Liverpool anthem on the night where they've had this famous win over Barcelona, 3-0 at the New Camp, but here tonight at Anfield, they've beaten Barcelona 4-0 to go into the Champions League final. It was such a difficult task. Alan, lots of the talk before the game was about the players who were missing. It was about missing, Mo Salah.
