  "transcript": " So the pre-match formalities are completed and we're ready for the start of the first leg of this round of 16th tie in the Champions League. Liverpool with Alison in goal, Alexander-Arnold Gomez, Van Dyke and Robertson, Henderson Fabinho and Bayt Cetic, Salah Gatot on the fit, Darwin Nunez and Real Madrid with Courtois in goal, the man of the match in the final last season, Carvajal, Militão, Rudiga and Alaba, Calverde, Camarvinga and Modric, Rodrigo Benzema and Jr. So Karen Benzema is fit and Venetius Jr. who like Benzema has scored 16 goals this season, one of the real danger men in this quality Real Madrid side. The teams are ready, Liverpool in the all red with the white trim, Real Madrid their first choice colours as well, the famous all white and it's Real Madrid who kick off and immediately fire the ball forward, Boosfer the former Chelsea man Antonio Rudiga as he gets his first touch and Real Madrid with the ball in their own right back area. Liverpool playing from right to left in the first half so towards the Anfield road end defending the Cop and it is Real Madrid in possession inside their own half, the whistles, Real Madrid in possession in the early stages of this as the ball is cleared by Courtois from the ground to the halfway line, Venetius tries to get away from Alexander-Arnold, the Joe Gormas is there to collect possession and see it back to Alisson and Liverpool have it but it actually spun up against Andy Robertson down there halfway inside and bounced off him out of play for a throw into Real Madrid down the right hand side so it is a throw in to the visitors from the Spanish capital and they take the throw back into their own half where Militão will just with his right foot see it back to Courtois out to Camarvinga part of the French World Cup winning squad, this young man with such a bright future playing in the centre of the midfield and then Militão wins the throw in off Courtois Gatpo, he will be keeping an eye as well Alan Shearer on just how fit Darwin Nunes appears to be a shoulder problem as Camarvinga is caught in possession, Henderson through to Gatpo, he slipped at the crucial moment, he was almost through into the box and he seemed to be checking back from the position that he was in inside the area when he slipped. I think he was just trying to get it onto that right foot just to open the goal up to see more of the goal and put himself in the middle of the goal, he actually slipped when he did that. Well there's no surprise with the reaction of this crowd before the game it's inevitable you're going to see a quick start from these Liverpool players and that's exactly what happened. So the former England captain Alan Shearer with us here at Anfield High, very high in the main stand just above and to the right of Jürgen Klopp who's down there already directing his troops and Stoke have equalised against Swansea in the championship, Josh Laurent with the equaliser so it's Swansea 1, Stoke 1, quite a busy night tonight so we'll keep you across all of the top matches and Rotherham have taken the lead against Sunderland, Oliver Rathbone scoring, Rotherham 1, Sunderland 0, Real Madrid playing the ball in from the left hand side there, Allisland all in black tonight, able to come out and catch the bouncing ball into his chest. The Liverpool players are full of energy out there, they're trying to close down as quick as possible and react to this crowd. So it's back to Allisland, takes a touch on the edge of the box, it's Modric who is there, closing him down but Liverpool pass it out from the back and Alexander Arnold who was if you remember rather caught out by Venetius Jr in the Champions League final in France last season, turns, plays it up through the middle, the gap talk comes back to Jungvijj Tjernic, big night for him, the 18 year old, now it's on the right hand side with Salah, Salah approaching the penalty area, slips the ball into the box, afflicts from Nunez, what a goal, Liverpool in front early against the holders and what a huge finish that was, past fit to play, he looked fit to me when he put that in the net, Liverpool 1, Real Madrid there. Well what a goal, what a finish, it's started by Tjernic having the confidence and the belief to switch it out to the right hand side and then Salah whips that ball in on the run of Nunez and then the little flick, I said it was going to be a quick start from Liverpool, I didn't expect this quick. Just one drink in my mind whether there might be an offside issue with that and we're just seeing it again now, no he's onside, he's onside, I'm actually looking at a different television to you Alan, you've not seen it yet. I think I'm about two seconds behind you on my TV, what a ball in, what a ball in from Salah from the right hand side with his left foot, he whips it in and it's about timing of the run from Nunez and he did it perfectly. Oh lovely, we're just seeing it again as it comes in low from the right hand side from Salah and I think it was a great pass into his path and Nunez running across it from left to right inside the penalty area, what does he send the yards out, there's a leap and with his right heel as it bounces it's a flick with the inside of his right heel beyond Kuatra and into the net. It's a fantastic goal, it really is, everything about it, the pass in from Salah, the timing and overrun and then together get the connection as he did with that right foot, what a goal, what a start. Liverpool won Real Madrid 0 and that's quite a goal, if you can get yourself into a position where you can see that at some point over the course of the next few hours and that's raised the roofs inside Anfield including the one that's not quite finished yet at the Anfield road end, ball in for Liverpool to the edge of the box that Salah turned provider and Nunez, you know there was a question over whether he's going to be able to play as Real Madrid come forward with a ball from the right hand side from Rodrigo, it's Venetius Jr now on the left hand side, a flick from Rodrigo back to Modric, Modric into the D on the edge of the area, Valverde was there as well, Modric couldn't get there and Liverpool were able to clear, well this is quite a start, Stoke are now 2-1 up at Swansea, Josh Lauren scored again so Swansea won Stoke 2 and that goal from Darwin Nunez in the fourth minute, so opening goal on Saturday at St James's Park, opening goal on Tuesday night here at Anfield against Real Madrid, it's not a bad double that, Alan? It's not bad at all, it's amazing isn't it when you're finding goal scoring so hard to come by and all of a sudden you get one and then another one comes straight away. 12 for the season for Darwin Nunez, that's his fourth in the Champions League and remember Liverpool who started this Champions League campaign losing 4-1 away against Napoli, here's Fabinho to the edge of the penalty area, Camargo Vinga with a challenge, Fabinho fell into the box, referee Corbache says that was a clean challenge by Camargo Vinga and Benzema then with the flick for Venetius Jr, the Gomez is in, go with him shoulder to shoulder with Venetius Jr and actually beat him to the ball and play it back to Alisson, that epitomizes the strong start that Liverpool have made. That was a vital tackle that was from Joe Gomez, him and Venetius going 1v1 and he just nudges him away off the ball, showed great strength there to get to it first. So Liverpool, great noise already before that goal went in and it's obviously a smoke bomb, a red smoke bomb has gone off because the, I can see that pale red smoke now just drifting up to the roof of the cop and then out the front of the stadium at the top and there goes rectangular red scoreboards, now read Liverpool FC 1, Rayon Madrid 0, 7 minutes on the clock, after all those chances they had in the Stade de France at the end of last season, couldn't beat Thibault Courtois, looking back at it Alan, some of the saves, you know, he said it at the time but when you see it again, remarkable really and that's why it was torture for Jurgen Klopp I guess to watch it at the weekend. And Alaba loses possession on the far side, Salah puts his foot on the ball, Salah who scored in his last five Champions League appearances, the last five group matches, played forward by Henderson, Salah into the box now and he's shrugged off the ball, excellent defending from the experienced Alaba to go with him, come out with the ball then Venetius Jr who was blocked by Fabinho but he knew he wasn't going to get to the ball either, Venetius Jr so ran into Fabinho, won the free kick but I don't think it's going to be any more than that. We've only been playing eight minutes John and already two or three times down that Liverpool right hand side, the goal came from there then that pass from Henderson in behind for Salah again, they're looking comfortable down that side. Liverpool one, Real Madrid nail, still nail nail in the other match tonight, I track Frankfurt against Napoli who won Liverpool's group and Real Madrid with the ball in front of their own penalty area. Tomorrow night, RB Leipzig against Manchester City so you'll hear that this time tomorrow live from inside the stadium in Germany with Ian Dennis and Matt Upson and I think they're here from no matter the half time actually in this match and the England Belgium game will be on Sport Expert tomorrow night in the Arnold Clark Cup and we will hear from Serena Wiegman at half time as well but nine minutes played, one nail to Liverpool and quite a goal from Darwin Nunes, he scored a better one that so far for Liverpool, I'm not sure if I've seen it, he has Bayer Cetiz inside his own half, what a night for him Bayer Cetiz? He's made a really good start, he played a part in the goal as did Gackport, they both had early touches and they were really good touches which didn't have to give you confidence in the early part of the game. Yes and remember he is a Spaniard born in northern Spain in Viggo, his dad played for South of Viggo, so well aware of what Real Madrid are all about and this is his seventh consecutive start, so regular start I'm out for the number 43, Liverpool with the ball on the right hand side, Salah and Alexander-Arnold together, Salah gets it down, he's got space on the right hand side, right foot across towards the edge of the area, it's over everyone, Robertson was arriving but he had to check back and then it's given away by Cetiz, that's how it works of course, talking up and he gives the ball away, Real Madrid now coming forward with Venetius Jr, it bounces out to the left hand side, Benzema, first time we've seen him involved really, Benzema out of the edge, the middle of the half to Valverde, he's playing in the central role tonight, the Uruguayan, now Benzema again, Benzema cutting in from the left hand side but Modric just as he receives the pass, doesn't even attempt to give it back to Benzema, just goes back out to the far side, look at Modric at the age of 37, saw so much of him at the World Cup, now here he is again, what a career still going, but he'll ever finish, now the ball to the right hand side, the Carvajal, Carvajal low into the edge of the penalty area, Rodrigo is there but Robertson comes across with with a challenge just to take it away Real Madrid having their best spell so far, crossing from the left hand side though, that's an easy catch for Alisson, 1-0 Liverpool, yeah again though when Liverpool were attacking just 30 seconds ago, it was down that right hand side again and they're having to work really hard down there, particularly defensively, Venetius and Alaba at left back, second leg in the Spanish capital in three weeks time, we'll be there for that and at the moment with this score line, long long way to go but it's set up very interestingly with that goal, as I say in the fourth minute, oh heavy touch from Gomez on the edge of his own penalty area, Benzema was onto him, Liverpool haven't got it away, it's back to Benzema, squares it, Rodrigo with a chance but Van Dijk is able to come across and just steps into the way of the shot and blocks it away with his left foot, sloppy from Gomez, his team here, he's sent a half-partner, helped him out a lot there, what a block that was, Liverpool breaking away and Gatko has been clearly pulled back by Camavenga but the referee's playing advantage and Gatko's found Salah and Salah approaching the penalty area, Benzema and shooting wide at the Neapolst, God they look so good going forward, don't they Gatko, fantastic getting that ball again at his feet, getting it and turning, having the strength to push the defender off, then roll the ball out to Salah again on that right hand side and he cuts in on that left foot and he's just waiting for him to hit it on you and he does hit it but he just doesn't get the connection that he wanted. Yeah just seen to miss hit it really but I mean he burst between the two Real Madrid players and he was cute, he was going for the near bottom corner wasn't he? Tried to see it and I don't watch the eyes didn't he where he was looking at the far side, his right hand side and he tried to just pull it back towards the near post. Liverpool coming forward with Bayekic but runs into a nest of white there near the edge of the Real Madrid penalty area and Milly Tau plays it back to Kua Tua who clears from the ground but that will bounce out of play, actually it's bounced right into the hands of the former Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti down there, four times winner now of the Champions League as a coach, no one's done that, been involved in five Champions League finals as a coach, that's a record as well and Gomez playing a long pass over the top but Kua Tua will come and take that. Apparently the goal that Nunez scored was the quickest goal that Liverpool have scored at Anfield in the Champions League which mildly surprised them fourth minute. Norwich have taken the lead against Birmingham City so Norwich won Birmingham Nell, another Nunez, Marcelino Nunez with the goal for Norwich. Five live final score in operation tonight with all of the matches, Valverde hooking the ball in field but Van Dijk is able to come across and clear it to the halfway line, there's a slip by Henderson in there then a slip by Camervenga, we've seen quite a lot of that actually from the players who both changed, Henderson now to gap over advances away from him and Kua Tua has lost it and Salah scores, oh what a slip, what a slip from the great Kua Tua, the man who almost single-handedly stopped Liverpool in the Champions League final last season, awful touch, gave it straight to Salah and Salah said yep that'll do for me and it was in the back of the net in a flash and it's Liverpool 2, Real Madrid Nell, less than 15 minutes on the clock. What a huge error, that is from Kua Tua, he wasn't really under any pressure, he decides to take another touch foolishly because he can see Salah coming down at him and he just gets it all wrong and it falls so kindly for more Salah, he says thank you very much, open goal 2-0. Well of all the things that we might have seen tonight, I wasn't expecting that, he chested it down and it bounced off his knee, he chested it down, was going to take a touch, bounced up and when he went to play it, it bounced off his knee on his standing foot straight into the path of Salah on the corner of the six yard box, one touch left foot bang 2-0. Salah's not even putting them under pressure, Salah's actually stood off him there until he actually decides to take that other touch and gets it horribly wrong where it hits his knee and bounces perfectly for Salah. Nuno's in the fourth minute, Salah in the 14th, Salah who now becomes the top scorer this season in the Champions League incidentally, that's his eighth goal in the Champions League and that means he's scored in six consecutive Champions League matches now, Blackburn are winning 1-0 over Ewood Park against Blackpool, so Blackburn 1, Blackpool 0, Tyrese Dolan with the goal there and the crowd inevitably getting straight onto Courtois when it was played back to him and this time his sure foot had clearance. Just what he should have done the first time instead of trying to take that extra touch, it wasn't a great ball into him but it wasn't that difficult to see what he actually did, he took win and taken that extra touch, terrible error. Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 0, still 0-0, Eintracht Frankfurt and Napoli and Real Madrid now, both swept in from the left hand side but it's hooked away by Van Dijk in the penalty area, just in front of the penalty spot, right foot, volleys it out to the far side. I did wonder whether Matip might have played tonight but the Joe Gomez continues in the team, seven starts in a roll for him now, Matip on the bench tonight, back alongside Van Dijk who returned to the team against Newcastle, now Real Madrid on the right, attacking towards the court, down to where we're right but the ball in from Carvajal is deflected out of play by Núñez, comes back to the Real Madrid number two after the throw and now to Mili Tau, the Brazilian World Cup defender, just carries the ball, just drags it to his left and gives it to Ruediga, Champions League winner with Chelsea in Porto against Manchester City remember, Ruediga forward towards Modric who flicks it nonchalantly, roundabout waist height, just got his foot up and with the outside of his boot gave it to the left hand side to Venetius but now on the right, Carvajal heads it into the box, Rodrigo pulls it back but pulls it back behind Benzemaque and Liverpool are able to take possession and Fabinho plays it downfield, Salah on the stretch, can't get to it and Ruediga is able to see it back to Cuatroar, Tivo Cuatroar on his left foot passes it out into the right back position and Real Madrid clear. I shouldn't laugh, John, but the reaction to the crowd makes me. I don't care who you are, you know, Tivo Cuatroar, one of the best goalkeepers in the world, so if you've got 50 or 1000 people inside Anfield putting pressure on you like that when you've made a mistake, a bad mistake just a few minutes earlier, that's going to get to anyone, I don't care. Here's Robertson, Robertson right footed forward comes off Valverde, bounces into the Real Madrid half and Militão should deal with that. That's a poor ball away from Militão, he's giving it to Bytetnic, Núñez available on the left, that was the pass actually, we can see from up here he went infield and that gave it back to Real Madrid, however Fabinho has got it forward at the centre circle, angle ball from him, Robertson, Salah with a flake and then headed back by Carvajal to Cuatroar. Panic stations every time it goes into that back four of Real Madrid, the Liverpool players have put that much pressure on them, they seem as if every time they get in the ball they're under pressure and they're making mistakes, Liverpool are forcing them into them. That's a series of errors at the back from Real Madrid, giving the ball away, obviously the Cuatroar slip that led to the second goal, so Núñez and Salah with the goals, 19 for the season now for Salah, Real Madrid playing the ball out from the back and Camavinha now to the left hand side, Norte Uemene who stayed at home, he's been ill as well but Tony Carose on the bench tonight for Real Madrid having been flown in this afternoon, recovered from the illness that he had, didn't travel with the squad last night, he has Modric on the left hand side, Modric to Venicius Jr and then back to the centre circle, Real Madrid have actually won their last four matches but two of them were at the Club World Cup, ended up playing Al Hilal in the final but have won their two league matches since they returned, eight points behind Barcelona who will be here in the north west of England, well they'll be arriving tomorrow won't they to play Manchester United on Thursday, it's quite a week that isn't it, these four clubs all playing in the north west of England in the same week, Real Madrid with Camavinha out to the left hand side taken down by Venicius, Venicius Jr now near the left corner of the penalty area, cutting in field then turning back to Benzmont close quarters, Venicius Jr again great footwork, oh what a goal, that's incredible, what a finish from Venicius Jr, how he saw that, there were defenders, three of them in front of him, he had to beat Alisson as well and he whipped it, bent it low into the far bottom corner and Real Madrid have a goal back, a brilliant goal back to one Liverpool. World class defenders all over him, no space whatsoever, he just picks his spot, he has one little look up and curls that in with his right foot, he looks at that far corner, there's hardly any space, Gomez is trying to close him down, Alisson's got no chance, what a response from Real Madrid that is. Well that's changed the mood which was celebratory when Liverpool were two-nil up, but that goal in the 21st minute so three goals in the first quarter of the match, first quarter of the first leg, and now it's the Real Madrid fans down there all in white who have been very very quiet for the first 20 minutes of the match but suddenly it's all Real Madrid songs in that corner and flags waving, Spanish national flags, as Henderson wins the ball back from Venicius in the edge of the area, Salah into the box but that will just roll through to Couottoir. Norwich now two-nil up on Birmingham, Marcellino with his second goal of the match for Norwich, Norwich two Birmingham nil, so there we are then, well when you have quality like that on the field, Alon, you can't do anything about that. It's just a little message, well not a little, it's a big message to Liverpool to see, we've got world-class players particularly in forward positions and that's exactly what they can do, they can punish you. And there he is again, Venicius Jr scored the only goal in the final against Liverpool last season, scored two goals against Liverpool in the quarter-final the season before when Real Madrid won 3-1 in Madrid and that did it, that was enough to see them through and now here he is again, a real thorn in Liverpool's side. He actually wanted a little one too I think you know with Benzemaal because I think Benzemaal the ones that actually cleared it into him, he ran off and thinking he was going to get it back, no chance, he just moved inside, moved the ball one yard and whipped it into that far post. From probably, over on the left-hand side of the penalty area, certainly 20 yards I would have said, approaching 20 yards but it was pinpoint and Alisson, his view might have been blocked actually Alisson from with all of the defenders who were in there but anyway it was hit with such pace, Liverpool coming forward though, ball from the right-hand side, Robertson plays it across the box in Rudiger, he was able to clear it away only to Alexander-Arnold though but the bouncing ball, he's lost the bouncing ball and Camervinga plays it forward for Venicius Jr and Real Madrid, it's 4 against 3 and it's played across into the path of Gomez who was able to readjust and clear it away and he got that wrong Venicius Jr. And it was good defending John from Virgil van Dijkers, he was actually left within 1v1 and instead of diving and he just stood up there and didn't panic and forced them into the pass which is a poor one. Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 1, special occasion, it's already been a special match hasn't it? We said there was going to be goals John didn't we? We were right, that's not often, first time for everything, by Cetic, so this is quite a start to what is a really big few days of commentary matches on 5 live, that's what they're all like this, van Dijk, swinging the ball forward towards the far side, Henderson's out there, comes back in field towards Fabinho, Fabinho back onto his right foot, Alexander-Arnold, Alexander-Arnold, oh that's a lovely ball through to Henderson who cuts it back, Salah, Salah still going, bounces down, Munoz still in the 6 yard box and Real Madrid have cleared it, Kavahal just hacked it away in the end and I'm not sure quite how that didn't end up in the back of the Real Madrid net. Well Trent, Salah, Henderson causing chaos again down there right hand side and they get the ball and how on earth that doesn't end up in the back of the net with Salah having to go, Nunez having to go and Real Madrid players throwing themselves at the ball, a yard or two off their goal line, he managed just to clear it. The balance of Salah there is incredible when the ball is cut back to him, there are three defenders there and he's twisting and turning, keeps the ball at his feet, I think he back healed it goalwards in the end, that was blocked, Feltonuñez, Real Madrid player down so we've got a stoppage, it feels like the first stoppage of the match and we're in the first, we've played 25 minutes now and it's going to be a throwing deliverable for the Real Madrid man down, surrounded by his teammates so it's not absolutely clear who it is down there, is it Alaba, could be, but Chance van Field actually just have to take a breath here after an incredible first 25 minutes in the Champions League, we say it time and again Alan, don't we? And why do they want to change it, why do they want to tamper with it? No, you honestly, it baffles me is because it works, it works perfectly and when you see performances and matches like this evening, absolutely why? I'm not sure he's going to be able to continue, that's quite a loss, I think it is Alaba and I think I've seen the indication there from the medical people that it's a problem and yeah Real Madrid are going to make a change, so it's Nacho, I think they experience Nacho Fernandez who is being called forward by Carlo Ancelotti who's leaning over him, hands in his pocket, just muttering a couple of pearls of wisdom to him and Alaba, the long-clowned Bayern Munich man, Champions League winner now with Real Madrid as well, playing in the final last year, actually playing central defensive if you remember last year with Mendi Fullback who's out injured at the moment and yep he's being led off the field over on the far side so this is the first change and that is it for Alaba, just giving a little hook there by Edan Militao, consolation and Nacho is coming on and he is going to take over there on the far side on the left, Nacho. Alaba had a really tough time in those 27 minutes he's actually been on the pitch because I said it maybe five or ten minutes ago the number of times that Liverpool attacked down that side. Yeah Liverpool back underway by Chetituk, the ball across the penalty area in the back is out and behind, yes is our friend Mark Lawlinson would say occasionally in circumstances such as this, maybe it's a problem with twisted blood after being sent this way and to the by Liverpool but Salas had a, oh there's another slip in the area by Militao and he was able to recover and get up and clear it away downfield, it has been an issue whether it's been over watered I don't know but the players have slipped on a regular basis. Yeah there have been three or four of them and Militao's actually still limping there because of that slip. Gomez clears the ball away downfield that's Alan Shearer with us here for this dramatic Champions League match here on five live, ball still in play on the far side Fabinho stretching forward that's off his shin, Valverde that is head to it, Camervenga then plays it back into centre of the fence and it's played back with Pace by Rudiger to Courtois but he was able to deal with that, control it and Real Madrid pass it out from the back, Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 1 is the score, long ball downfield that's chested down to a teammate by Alexander-Arnold to Van Dijk, Salah now turning on the halfway line but Rudiger passes it back to Courtois, this not as Pace so he was able to watch that under his left foot and clear it to the halfway line, Modric now back to Camervenga again who with his head bobbing gives it by a Militao now to Carvajal on the right hand side and then Rodrigo back and field to Carvajal, angles it back to Valverde 30 yards out square from him to Modric, left foot then to the edge of the box to Benzema, Modric again to the left hand side, Venetius clips it into the back post, Carvajal couldn't quite get to it because Núñez came across and was able to head it behind for a corner. It's really good work from Núñez, we saw what he can do at the other end but that's what you've got to do as well, you've got to do a little bit defensive when you certainly did there otherwise Carvajal was in at that far post. Corner event for Real Madrid, first corner of the match actually, half an hour played, Modric just runs his fingers through his fair hair, headband on and the referee's blowing his whistle so Modric's delivery is academic, you'll have to do it again and it's Fabinho and Benzema who are being spoken to, Benzema continues to talk to the referee, Benzema coming back for this match, he's had a bruising on his leg, that was the issue that kept him out of the weekend, Modric then with the corner, comes off a Real Madrid head right to Venetius at the back, Venetius shoots across, that's an excellent save by Alisson, cross shot from the far side of the box, bang on target would have gone in the same corner that he scored his first goal but Alisson was up to it this time, he's almost identical from exactly the same position, he moves it again onto his right foot, this time Alisson just managed to get to his left hand side and down low, it's a fantastic effort again and a good save by Alisson, yeah he was at full extension there, got his left glove to it, Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 1, the half time coming up in the 745 kickoffs tonight so I'll run you through those when we get them all in, we're going to go to Millwall in a moment but Henderson gives it to Bychetta, she was shrugged off the ball, Real Madrid have got it back, Camervinga might have been fouled by Fabinho, referee plays the advantage, Benzema back to Modric, 25 yards out into the edge of the area, Rodrigo and then Valverde slashes his shot and it lands halfway up the cup. Well first of all Camervinga did well to win the ball and then release it into the little magician of Modric into that, into the midfield and the balance and the technique that he's showing out there is just incredible considering his age and they move the ball to that right hand side, I think it's Valverde that actually takes the shot on when he had other options in the middle you know, luckily for Liverpool he put it high into the cup. Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 1, five live, BBC sounds if you're on the move of course, you can listen to the live radio wherever you are, Liverpool playing the ball out from the back, we're going to go to the den when we get a chance because it is half time there, the lead has Burnley, here's Fabinho playing it up towards Henderson who chests it off and then Alexander-Arnold it might have bounced up into the arm of Venetius, it is, it's a free kick to Liverpool on the halfway line, so come in from East London, Aaron Paul. We're in deep south, Millwell-Nill, Burnley-Nill, the league leaders have dominated large parts of this half but have been frustrated by Millwall who have boxed clever George Longus, save one from Ana Zorri, Zian Fleming has come closest for the home side, Millwell. Half time, Blackburn 1, Blackpool 0, Norwich 2, Birmingham 0, Swansea 1, Stoke City 2 and they're still playing, Rotherham and Sunderland in the first half and it is 1-0 to Rotherham as Carbohal heads the ball out of play. League 1 half times coming up but Liverpool in possession on the halfway line with Bytcetic, square to Gomez and then Gomez, load at the right hand side, Salah with the first time touching to the path of Henderson on the right, Henderson back to Salah, bounces off Valverde into the path of Salah, almost, Salah then is able to get there first, played to the left hand side to Robertson, comes back to the edge of the penalty area, Gakpo is after that but he slipped again, Gakpo then wins it back from Nacho and Gakpo's cross is over everyone in red and is hooked away by Valverde on the edge of the box. The mistakes at the back of Real Madrid are just incredible, they're inviting Liverpool onto them and Salah and Nunez, look as they've happened the field day there, every time they get the ball they're looking dangerous and under pressure. So jittery don't they Real Madrid, Salah carrying the ball between two defenders blocked by the third on the edge of the area but Real Madrid so dangerous on the break although Jordan Henderson extremely well to come back and take the ball away from Venetius, half time in league one, Fleetwood Nail, Cambridge United Nail and Morkham Nail, Port Vale Nail and in league two this is easy all four matches in league two at halftime are Nail Nail, one-one between Hamilton and Inverdes in the championship in Scotland at halftime and Albion Rovers Nail, Elgin City Nail at halftime also, a ball with Liverpool on the right hand side Alexander-Arnold comes across and the ball's chipped out of play and it's a throwing to Liverpool down the right hand side that is taken by the Liverpool right back who incidentally is a yellow card away from suspension in the Champions League ball in from him to the back post with Robertson arriving but it was just a little too high defender might have got a touch must have done it's out of play it's a throwing to Liverpool down the left which is taken by Nunez back to nearer the halfway line by Chetnick and then Fabinho goes back into his own half and Liverpool with Fabinho right footed ball cross field taken down by Salah, Salah running at Nacho the 33 year old the substitute and then Salah with a touch on the Nacho who kept it in did well actually, Modric inside his own half he gives it away Modric but Alexander-Arnold couldn't take advantage bounces down centrally by Chetnick as well but then gives it to Valverde and now Real Madrid Valverde with a pass through the middle Gomez on the chase Gomez plays it back to Venetius oh! Alisson's clearance has gone in it's hit Venetius oh my goodness it's 2-2 at Anfield and Alisson's clearance charged down by Venetius Jr and agonisingly bounced off him and looped gently on the bounce into the back of the Liverpool match in front of the Cop and it's Liverpool 2 Real Madrid 2 first the error at one end from Courtois now one at the other from Alisson cannot believe what I'm seeing John in terms of the number of errors that have been made out on the pitch in this first half already from both keepers Courtois you mentioned a horrific error earlier on and that's another one that's all you can see there from Alisson I don't know what he's thinking he's trying to play the ball out instead of getting rid of it your team are leading just get rid and try to instead of trying to play it out he just wax it on to Venetius he hasn't got a clue where it's going fortunately for him in Real Madrid it goes in the back of the net but goodness me Alisson just clear it it's not on in the 14th minute Liverpool were 2-0 up and Anfield was rocking now in the 37th minute it's 2-2 and Venetius Jr has done it again two goals against Liverpool in the quarter final the season before last the winning goal in the Champions League final against Liverpool at the end of last season and now two goals here at Anfield to bring Carlo Ancelotti's side back from well they weren't on the precipice exactly but they were really rocking 2-2 what a first half goal but we said before the game is that because they experienced that Real Madrid have they don't panic in situations like this they've been in these situations before they believe that their ability will get them through and they didn't panic at all well that's something that Jürgen Klopp touched on yesterday about their pedigree pedigree of Real Madrid when you play for that club you're not going to lose the plot basically because it's it's drilled into you you've got a manager like Carlo Ancelotti who you know he's never going to be he's never going to be too much either one way or the other Carlo Ancelotti just about all you get from him is one eyebrow raised and then back it goes into place again he's very laid back isn't he isn't he uh it is still Plymouth Nill Cheltenham Nill by the way in the Papa John's trophy semi-final that was an eight o'clock kick off as well like this one so uh it's 2-2 well if this tie continues like this we've still got three halves of it to go then this is uh this could be anything Liverpool with it in their own harsh Liverpool who who've lost just once here this season in all competitions the the win for League United for Jesse Marsh's League United but now at 2-2 obviously anything could happen tonight here's Henderson on the right hand side back in field towards Alexander Arnott and Napoli have taken the lead against they tracked Frankfurt in Germany the Italian League leaders scoring through their their main man the much-wanted Victor Ossimen van Dijk to Robertson and then van Dijk in his own half so I tracked Frankfurt Nill Napoli one halftime around about six minutes plus added time away here there won't be much of that although we had the injury to Alaba he has Gatbaugh on the edge of the area and his Liverpool Champions League debut chest sit down but it bounces away from him and it's cleared away downfield by Rudiga Liverpool with Gomez it was Gomez's pass back to uh to Allison that led to the second finishes goal but I don't think you're going to apportion any blame to him he's actually done well against finishes ball played over the top down the right hand side drilled across by Darwin Nunez on the volley from near the dead ball line Robertson's kept it in no he hasn't kept it in and it's a throw in to Rayon Madrid halfway inside their own half Alan Shearer nearly 40 minutes gone I can't believe it I don't want it to end it's incredible what a half we've had we've already had 90 minutes worth of action it's unbelievable 90 minutes worth of incident it's incredible from from the very first minute when those players walked out onto the pitch the atmosphere was electric and then Liverpool went after Rayon Madrid and then we thought here we go two goals up but because of that experience and that know-how and they didn't panic they've got themselves back into the game albeit having Allison to thank. I was going to say to you when Liverpool were two in a look but we didn't get time didn't get the chance in Europe um under Jurgen Klopp Liverpool have played the first leg of European ties at home six times and they've gone through all six occasions however it's now 2-2 and it's right back in the balance Benzema back to Venetius Jr on a hat trick he wouldn't count that out comes back to Allison takes a touch and then passes it out with the angle at the left hand side and Robertson now rolls it forward kept in play by Milletow and then Carvajal running across it when the ball was off the field stops Robertson getting to it quickly sort of experience there and Liverpool take the throw back into their own half so dramatic night here at Anfield we'll hear from Germany at half-time Ian Denison and Matt Upson have made their way there today so looking ahead to Arby Leipzig against Manchester City we'll hear what Pep Guardiola had to say on Thursday night you will hear Manchester United Barcelona live from Old Trafford here on Five Live with Alistair Bruce Ball and Peter Schmeichel who's here tonight Peter and then they're all building up to the big game on Sunday Allen Newcastle United against Manchester United will be at Wembley for that here's Robertson on the left hand side but Rodrigo's able to come across chip forward to Rodrigo who just keeps it in in front of the darkly dressed Carlo Ancelotti and Liverpool put it out of play for a throw in there are some seriously talented forward players out on that pitch tonight whether it's Salah coming on his left side on that from the right or whether it's Venetius Jr on the left side as well I mean there's some incredible football and touches and you're looking at it up close as we are here by Chet it comes in on the challenge with Carvajal bounces away to Núñez Camavinda now he's been fouled by Núñez because sprawling down the biturbo that'll be a free kick to Real Madrid in their own right back position so very often you'll see matches like this you know first halves like this goals action incident and then second half things sometimes will calm down and very often you won't see a goal in the second half but oh don't talk it down come on I was just gonna say I'm not making any of those kind of predictions with this match so there we are if you make it clear as well you won't be with us on Sunday you'll not have your broadcasting head on no I hopefully have some other head on yeah sensible head well that depends on the result on the score yeah two and a half minutes to go to halftime and it is Gomez who is tricked by Valverde in the centre circle free kick to Liverpool it absolutely love it this place to see Liverpool get back in front before halftime Robertson on the left hand side so far when it's got the makings of a minor classic here's Fabinho Fabinho moving away from Valverde sin minor because it is the last 16 here's Alexander Arnold on the right hand side Salas out there as well just since there's more from Salah yet in this match as well the way that he's been by Chetich to van Dyke and Liverpool work it to the left hand side to Robertson and now Nunes who's started it all with that brilliantly flicked goal to put Liverpool one the look in the fourth minute cleared by Real Madrid but only to by Chetich who angles it through to Alexander Arnold who's in the middle bounces back to by Chetich he slips as he plays it four big shots for Hanpoor from everyone in a red scarf and the referee says yes it was a Hanpoor Real Madrid don't like that decision Modric several of them around the referee complaining about that I'm not sure there's much Modric could have done about that no he's rather close wasn't it oh that's a that is a that's a bonus what a half he's had though by Chetich yeah brilliant 18 years of age how comfortable is he look on the ball in every position take the under pressure spraying it around they're like that at that age though Alan I'm not sure I was like that and then when they get a little bit older suddenly you're aware of all of the the things that can go wrong well Trent Alexander Arnold's already scored with a brilliant free kick in this Champions League campaign remember the goal against Rangers it wasn't far away from here I think maybe slightly to the left and slightly closer from from memory but good position for him it'll be approaching 20 25 yards out and he's now got the ball in his hands the Champions League ball leans over bends down gives it a bounce on the floor catches it and then puts it in position and now two three steps away to his left Real Madrid wall just outside the box Alexander Arnold with the free kick for Liverpool curls it around the wall but close enough to Courtois to be able to kick a couple of little steps to his right and tap it down yeah he read it well didn't he so I thought it was gone then it did Valverde now is Real Madrid break for it he has finished us again pulls it across Rodrigo in the middle and a crucial tackle by Robertson in the six yard box just as Rodrigo was thinking he was going to put Real Madrid in front wow what a tackle from Robertson at that far post they do to Liverpool what Liverpool like to do to other teams is hit them on the break down the left hand side with Vinicius and he whips that ball in and Rodrigo's just about to tap it in two yards out Robertson gets his toe there and kicks it out for a corner absolutely crucial moment defensively for Liverpool from Robertson corner then Modric the out swinger is over Ruder get headed away by van Dijk behind him and now Liverpool look to break all the salad back heals it to Alexander Arnold who whips the ball forward long and forward to Núñez Núñez Carvajal backs away from him he leaves it actually to Modric Núñez now taking the ball into the full back position still against Modric onto his right foot plays it back up the line to by Cetic square from him to the Shaven headed Brazilian Fabinho and then back to van Dijk who will just pull the ball to the right hand side to Gomez we're into added time at the end of the first half Henderson now slips the ball past the defender still going Henderson dive comes in I think from Valverde I thought it might have struck him on the arm but it bounced behind you can't if don't otherwise we would have heard about it from the Liverpool supporters and in the end it's a goal kick well the game is so open both teams struggling defensively I just thought that the midfield a lack of protection from from both teams and when Liverpool go go throw they look such a threat and exactly the same with Real Madrid when they attack Liverpool at this cop end you think every time they're going to score that was a huge moment the the Rodrigo chance that Robertson only had to get that right and somehow was able to deflect it I mean the goal was almost at Rodrigo's mercy if he'd been able to get past Robertson but he blocked it wide and behind long and forward for Liverpool the Núñez near the edge of the box and then Rudiger is able to clear and the ball bounces out of play on the far side for a throw in to Liverpool in the third minute of added time now at the end of the first half three minutes were indicated and here's Salah on the right hand side twisting turning might have been fouled by Rudiger referee says play on Fabinho left footed Núñez put too much on that and it drift away he's saying that it might have taken a touch off the head of it around the great defender but it's goal kick that is given by referee Kovac I think the one with the free kick because Salah was upended I think it was Rudiger it was that took him out there and that's what the Liverpool fan their players were moaning out the referee that's Henderson's got actually gone across to speak to the referee and is making the point that we would have we would have preferred a free kick in the full back position there it was a really dangerous position if they had a given it as well that's what they wanted and should have had yeah well the referee's actually played two or three very good advantages in that first half so he's maybe getting a bit giddy with that and thought he would let it go there as well but there we are that that has been a thoroughly entertaining first half of Champions League football two to the score Liverpool two nil up the early goal from Núñez that was a brilliant flick from from Salah's pass and then Salah himself scoring the second after a monumental error by Tivol Courtois who miscontrolled it straight into the path of Salah but then Real Madrid and Venetius had their great moments a super finish from Venetius just when it seemed that Real Madrid were were out of it but they're never out of it brilliant goal low cross shot and then the error from Alisson at the other end straight into Venetius with his clearance and the ball bounced into the net and that crucial clearance as well in the end from Robinson off Venetius but I don't know what you want to pick out from that Alan but take your pick well the cameras didn't know who to pan on to there at the end the first of all the they went to Tivol Courtois for his error and then of course when Alisson was near in the the changing rooms they've sort of panned on to to him that doesn't tell us the the true story though there's been some fantastic forward play from Salah and from from from Núñez in several occasions but the star of the show in that first half was Venetius Tuna every time he got that ball out on the left hand side he's looked so dangerous but what a half it's been more of a say in the second please so Liverpool to Real Madrid to I'm intrigued to know where Kelly is going to go first with you after that what what are you thinking I'll be honest I was just listening to what you were saying and trying to try to pick up the pieces I mean what an extraordinary first half how do you even start to make sense of that there were yes defensive issues that you highlighted in commentary and yes there were goalkeeping errors from both Courtois and from Alisson but as you touched on there with Venetius Jr the attacking play in this game has been fantastic Alan it has from from both sides Kelly particularly from Liverpool down that right hand side with Salah and his link up play whether it's Henderson or little one twos with by Chechich or Trent Alexander-Arnold they've got their number in that position and they look so dangerous but on the other side of that Real Madrid down their left hand side with Venetius Jr the little one twos with Modric and and Benzemaar while what a player a great technique and the yeah that his first goal when he had no right to get his shot away when there was two or three Liverpool defenders around him and for him to manage to to get it past Alisson and bend it into that far post incredible ability so yeah what a half yeah what a half as well and on most Salah as well that's 44 goals in the Champions League that's the joint highest tally for an African player level with Didier Drogba now he's got past Stephen Gerrard's European goal scoring record for for Liverpool and he's a player who started the season slowly as many of the Liverpool side did but seems to be coming back into form he probably won't get an easy one not Kelly Olly I tell you what Alan you do need a break and I know you also need to get your monitors fixed Alan Shearer and John Murray our Anfield for us we've got Adam Lalani Kelly the match has blown up the monitor we've got Adam Lalani joining us as well of course at Brighton now but former Liverpool player has been part of some of these big nights at Anfield in the Champions League but Adam this one has been a special 45 minutes cause why do you're wetting on me there again Kelly yeah no it was definitely Alan what what a first half I mean Alan said he expected goals and there was goals and a lot more I mean it it went exactly how Liverpool and Jurgen would have wanted the game to go fast start fans were up two goals and they just they'll be so disappointed they let them back in I mean you said about Madrid's first goal there was a lot of bodies around it I just think Gomez Gomez will be slightly disappointed he went he went to block the ball with his wrong foot but a hell of a finish fantastic finish hell of a finish junior and he's just had a brilliant first half he's the youngest visiting player to score twice against Liverpool at Anfield in a major European competition since Johan Cruyff in December 1906 when he played for for IACS and it was a brilliant first half for him from Liverpool as Alan Shearer was saying there were so many opportunities for them do you feel that if we're going to be picky here they could have been a bit more clinical maybe yeah like down Liverpool's right hand side you know Jordan was making overlapping runs that they had a couple of other attempts on goal but I think to to be too in the lap at home to Madrid you'd take that you've just got to be a bit more solid and consolidate at the back and I'm surprised they've let them back in as early as they have obviously the momentum's now shifted probably slightly with Madrid so it'll be interesting to see how the second half plays out and obviously Salah's goal came from the error from from Courtois and then Madrid's second goal came from the error from from Allison who's got Liverpool out of so many difficult situations so far this season but this time he has to hold his hands up doesn't he yeah and he will he's the type of guy that will hold his hands up he's you know he's honest he'll come in and he'll react well from it it's um it was so surprising for that to happen especially after Courtois had a moment of madness or as what you'd call but um yeah he just kicked it straight into into the player and it's gone gone straight in the net very surprised the thing is you don't get the impression that this game is going to slow down the second half do you I hope not as well not for us and not for the for everyone watching it was you know magnificent tie and exactly what what the Champions League deserves Adam for now thank you very much Adam Lallana with us on five live sport is Liverpool to Real Madrid to at Anfield and there's another 45 minutes of that game still to come we'll be looking ahead to that one in the second half should kick off in less than 10 minutes I think at Anfield we're bringing up to date with the other score in the Champions League between Frankfurt and Napoli very shortly it's also a busy night in the EFL Aaron Paul is at the den for Millwall against Burnley there's been a goal Aaron there has deadlock broken here Kelly Millwall Neil Burnley won the visitors finally get the goal they've been looking for it's come courtesy of Ashley Barnes Burnley worked the ball into the Millwall box right to Lev Zeruri to Scott Twine who shot initially from around the penalty spot that can end off a defender up into the air and into the path of Ashley Barnes who smashed it past George Long in front of those Burnley fans to my left but Millwall have a free kick and a very promising position to my right George Savile and Xi'an Fleming standing over at 25 24 25 or so yards away from goal right to centre here comes Savile swings it into the area and Mirich can gather cleanly Millwall Neil Burnley won 54 minutes gone Aaron thank you very much so Aaron Paul will keep us up to date with that game else we're in the championship

saturday 18th of march 2023 this is five live sport with Kelly Kate's and our champions league commentary this evening round of 16 first leg and field between Liverpool and Real Madrid which was of course last season's champions league final is to all after 45 minutes the champions league commentary continues tomorrow with Ian Dennis leading the team in Germany well Manchester City resume their champions league campaign of course tomorrow as they're aiming to reach the quarterfinals for a sixth successive season but they're going to be without both de Bruyne and Le Porte because here in Germany tonight Pep Guardiola has revealed that they're going to miss the game through illness and indeed they are now doubtful for the weekend trip to Bournemouth in the Premier League but it's the champions league of course that we're going to be concentrating on and is a competition that Guardiola has had so much success in as a player and as a manager although his last triumph was actually 12 years ago but you're going to hear him now in a rather philosophical mood a reflective mood and also one in which he reveals interestingly regarding a change of mentality since he's been in charge at Manchester City I would say is my career finished tomorrow literally tomorrow are we more than blessed and grateful what I've done with the Barcelona Bayern Munich and here in Europe and a competition so I could never have a spect to have the career I had in the short time I don't know how far we go but the dream is go forward to do a good game tomorrow go to the quarterfinals so this is the point but of course it's a nice competition you know it's in England you can take a plane we dress beautiful to fly and we wanted to do our best and our best I have the illusion to do a quarterfinals it's going to happen it's going to happen so at the end the destiny is already written and we do our best all the work they have done we have been closed sometimes not sometimes closer so whatever I'm doing personally with the future whatever I've done despite I'm going to fail nothing will be enough so that's why when I learned that I mentioned that we just have fun and joy being here and this press conference after a good dinner with good wine and watch Madrid and Liverpool Liverpool Madrid prepare well the game let them feel the players let's go guys try to do it again again and and that's all so that was Pep Guardiola and here we are back in Leipzig and with me is the former England international defender Matthew Uppson and Matt Guardiola there basically talking about the pressure that Manchester City are as a club that they've got to try and win everything and he's he revealed that change of mentality that he's just going to enjoy it you've got to admire that haven't you yeah I think you have to admire it but also perhaps it's essential and perhaps that's the reason why he's having this change of philosophy because the pressure can sometimes be too much and ultimately when when you do your best and you prepare your best and give it everything you can then you see where you lie and Manchester City for me are a team that if they do that they're capable of winning the Champions League which is what they want ultimately so it's a slight change of reflection I understand that maybe that's to let the players know that of course they want to win but also they just want to go out and do their best give it give the best account of themselves they possibly can and see what happens the only trouble is if he's trying to play it all down and he's saying I'm going to enjoy it I'm going to have good company I'm going to watch the Liverpool game and we'll have a glass of red wine which certainly I have to admire that the only thing is is that minutes beforehand in the same room Nathan Ackie was talking about it's quite clear over the last few years this is obvious this is the trophy we want to win so it quite clearly is is the trophy that they crave and the players know it yeah of course I think everyone at the club knows it Guardiola has a great history with the Champions League and hasn't won it with Manchester City so I'm sure he's desperate too but I think that is that is more for for himself for the players even though Nathan Ackie may say that but I think it's just a message for everyone to say look we're not we're not robots we're not super human but we're going to go and do our best and if we do our best we're capable of winning so it's a slightly more relaxed approach to what he's trying to say but I'm sure behind the scenes is his usual intense self thank you very much to Ian Dennis and to Matt Upson commentary of RB Leipzig against Man City at eight o'clock tomorrow on five live and on five sports extra at 745 England take on Belgium in the deciding game of the Arnold Clark Cup at Ashton Gate both sides have won that opening two matches but England are top of the table on goal difference in the Champions League round of 16 first leg this evening Napoli are one nil up in Germany against Eintracht Frankfurt and an extraordinary first 45 minutes between Liverpool and Real Madrid two all at half-time as both sets of players make their way out onto the pitch for the second half taking you through it Alan Shearer and John Murray yes thank you Kelly welcome everyone back inside Anfield yes it was thrilling exciting dramatic no further substitutions at the start of the second half so Liverpool as they were Allison Alexander Arnold Gomez Van Dyke and Robertson Henderson Fabinho and by Chateich Salah Gatbo and Nunes so Nunes and Salah scoring put Liverpool two nil up but they came from two nil down to make it two two and Real Madrid's team Courtois Carvajal Militao Rudiger and substitute Nacho Valverde Camarvinga and Modric Rodrigo Benzema and two goal Venetius Jr second half begins Liverpool all in red Real Madrid all in white shimmering white the lights are on at Anfield it's quite a mild night actually for February and Liverpool playing it through the middle flicked by Gatbo bit into the path of Carvajal who will clear it away Camarvinga now running but he's been chopped down by Henderson that's a free kick and with us tonight for this spectacle is the former England captain Alinshira it can't be like that first half again can it John well you tick me off in the first half the suggestion that it it wouldn't be oh so so strap yourself in here we go Rudiger to the left hand side to Venetius Venetius takes on Alexander Arnold Bull runs into the full back position Gomez comes across quite a strong challenge yeah it's given us a free kick I can see why they're disappointed Real Madrid fans are behind that the the line of that for the referee they were up in arms whether that played a part but I think it was a free kick it was a free kick I thought it was yeah he's carried on as he just left the first half Venetius first touch gets that ball goes on behind the defender says what you got and he wins his team a free kick in a dangerous position so this is five live BBC sounds welcome as well to listeners on BBC Radio Mersey side with us tonight you're very welcome to be joining us and it's a free kick two to the score free kick Modric standing over it little Modric with his long white shorts right down almost to the top of his socks standing just near the dead ball line Liverpool have packed the six yard box Rudiger's making a nuisance of himself in there waiting for the delivery here it comes from Modric plays it in line it's headed in at the near post and it's three two to Real Madrid and Adam Militao the central defender stolen in amongst all of those red shirts and Carlo Angelotti's Real Madrid have come from two nil down here at Anfield to lead three two well I said it was in a dangerous position I didn't think he'd get a free header Militao like he did there's no around him Liverpool players are all static he just runs in unchallenged unmarked says thank you very much free header three yards out three two good ball in from Modric he whips it in there but Militao he just drifts in there there's no one even with him comes from the far post gets in between the Liverpool defenders gets it on target simple goal far far too simple from a Liverpool point of view Alan that's like I mean it's like defending against statues the statues would have had more movement I think than the Liverpool defenders there and that's remarkable Liverpool defenders you know had their positions and Militao just ran in in between them and headed it in well we spoke before the game about Newcastle winning every set piece at the weekend with 10 men as Gomez hands off Vinicius 15 yards inside the the Liverpool half what a turn of events this is Liverpool to Real Madrid three that goal three minutes into the second half and Jordan Henderson has come across to to argue Gomez's case but there was an arm wasn't there there was an arm that caught him that wasn't a yellow card I don't think it was so it's a free kick to Real Madrid that Modric who took the free kick for that third goal so after 15 minutes Liverpool were winning 2-0 and and honestly if you weren't listening then the noise inside Anfield was was something else but Real Madrid the champions the European champions the recently crowned club world cup winners they have shown their character shown what they're all about really Modric playing the ball down into the Liverpool left-back position where it's controlled by van Dijk and played forward and then Robertson wins a throwing and I can't help but look down there on Carlo Ancelotti obviously one of his most agonizing days in football despite all of his champions the final wins was probably the one that he didn't win when his AC Milan side well you know the rest and now look at this look what his team has done here at Anfield how much must he be enjoying this there's that gap was chopped down on the halfway line and Eda Milleau is going to be told off and that's a final warning from the Romanian referee Istvan Kovac on the halfway line I see Rotherham are winning 2-1 now against Sunderland so they got themselves 2-0 but Joe Gellar to score I think this first goal for Sunderland on loan from Leeds Rotherham to Sunderland 1 and Liverpool with it on the right hand side five-life final scoring operation tonight in full swing as well it's on all outlets red button iPlayer BBC sport website and app to listen to the five-life commentary on this match alongside the Vidi Printer in the final score graphics rail Madrid with their Valverdeu turns into trouble turns into Gatpole so Liverpool in the second half attacking towards the Cop they need them they need everything now just going back to that goal that they've just conceded I mean you can't defend like that at any level let alone against one of the best teams in European football with some of the best players in European football you've got to get tight it's simple from a from a set piece just outside the box pick up your man Liverpool to rail Madrid three and he has Venetius on the left hand side plays the ball into Henderson who moved his right foot across caught the ball on it but that's centered spinning behind for another corner to rail Madrid so this is another another set piece for Liverpool to have to defend and it's been hard in mouth stuff this this is really what we were talking about at St James's Park if you were listening on on Saturday evening to the commentary about the vulnerability at the back corner is taken short actually by Modric to Venetius Venetius gets it back Modric as well Benzema is out there that's a slight worry for Liverpool that Benzema has not got in on the act yet as Modric slings over the cross which lands beyond the far post and behind for a goal kick to Liverpool so a goal kick it is that Alison passes out then back to Van Gaik inside the area and field absolutely packed here tonight of course it would be from match like this a night like this Liverpool who have not won in their last six matches against rail Madrid all of them in the Champions League after 15 minutes I've looked as though that might be coming to an end and Liverpool were going to have some triumph against rail Madrid but now they will do very well to turn this around to a winning position again but it has been it's been a night it's been a fraught night and it's one of those evenings where I don't know about you Alan I think probably there will be more goals and Alexander-Arnold plays it across and Munez was arriving might have been shoved in the back by Carvajal when sprawling in the box he's gone down referee Corbatch is not interested in that I think he's going to leave it to VAR yeah I didn't think it was a penalty I thought he was looking for it Gatpole now with it on the left hand side three defenders with him he's managed to find the ball to Robertson Robertson's ball across his block to the edge of the penalty area Modric getting it away and then it's swung away thrashed away on the volley halfway up the lower tier of the Saqenidar Glice stand and they've got the ball back quickly Liverpool Henderson now middle of the half almost high ball out to the right hand side to Alexander-Arnold Alexander-Arnold when Liverpool have probed and put rail Madrid under pressure they've caused problems that's what they're trying to do now Henderson's ball to the back post is headed out by Rodrigo five or six yards from the corner flag Robertson takes a quick throw back to by Cetic in field it comes to Fabinho Fabinho the tall number three just turns to his left the teenager by Cetic is there with the red socks down near his ankles now to Alexander-Arnold who beats Venetius left-footed ball in onto the head of Rudiger who got good distance on that header and Henderson if he's not careful he's going to be beaten to it by Venetius and that's it a short back pass but he hasn't had to be fouled by Venetius I think there's going to be a little fortunate to get that but he's got it and it's a three kick to Liverpool they're petrified by Venetius every time he gets that ball even when he hasn't got the ball and he's closing the Liverpool pool players down they're just petrified anywhere he goes near them I watched their game on Saturday night against Dossasuner and he was I mean he is right on the top of his game at the moment such a talent right top scorer now this season 18 goals for Real Madrid memory got 22 last season including the one that won the Champions League final now here's Carvajal playing the ball over the top down the right hand side that's for Rodrigo the other Brazilian on the other side to run onto Rodrigo is there he's got a bit of space as well Robertson's back in position the cutback intercepted by by Cetic Carvajal gives it back to Rodrigo now here's Benzema look out Liverpool Benzema gets it back left footed shot deflected in Alisson tried to react but the deflection beat him outstretched the Liverpool goalkeeper got something on it but he couldn't prevent it bouncing into the back of the Liverpool net and now it's Liverpool 2 Real Madrid 4 and Benzema via the deflection has given Real Madrid a clear turn there was a disaster this for Liverpool tonight they play the ball really well they work it really well down there at their right hand side little one two giving go to Benzema who just takes a little pot shot really with that left foot and the Liverpool defender closing them down in Gomez goes to close them down and just sticks that left foot out sticks the little heel out and it hits that heel and Alisson's already gone and he can't get back into the middle of the goal and just watches the goal for the ball go past him he was already committed the VAR are having a look at offside here but I think it's going to be onside Rodrigo when he burst down the right and Alisson in the six yard box diving to his left was diving to his right was it was already committed and then the deflection off Gomez just okay there's nothing Alisson could do about that he did his best he got a touch on it I feel for Gomez as well he's unfortunate there he was probably not tight enough we were saying at halftime Alan as Alan Adam Lallana actually said to Kelly Cates at the break on five live probably Gomez not tight enough to finish us for that it was actually his pass back to Alisson that that was charged down for that goal in the in the first half and now really unfortunate there with that one yeah there's not a lot you can do with a shot but it's the way the Real Madrid and particularly Benzema how they move the ball with pace and it's very very difficult to get near any Real Madrid player when they do that and then he opens himself up for the shot it's not a great shot and you're right there's nothing Alisson or Gomez can do about it it's just really unlucky so there we are Benzema we'll get that I think it was on target the shot from from the ball on door holder so his 17th of the season this injury hit season Medellin's had he's actually had five spells out injured and remember was ruled out of the World Cup with France that he's always a danger and he has indeed now joined the scorers tonight so Liverpool from 2-0 up are trailing 4-2 and we've still got over half an hour to play so all is not lost and Liverpool do continue to really cause problems when they come forward unfortunately they've conceded some terrible goals Gomez playing it across the back line to Van Dijk and the Real Madrid supporters here are now in great voice in their corner and their section of the Anfield Road stand Valverde is caught in possession by Chetwich so Henderson's onto that Henderson finding Robertson passing the ball into his path Robertson plays it for the Gatbos on side who's being played on by Nacho on this side Gatbos cross took a deflection Vane shouts for a hand ball Rudiger's ended up going down well off the ball inside the penalty area and Alisson's come right out of his goal to a near the halfway line and Rudiger's not very happy about something he's claiming that Nunes is actually elbowed him okay and the referee has now gone across the Nunes and has had a word and we're just watching it again and well it's a distant view it didn't seem to be a great deal in it on that view but he does catch him with his arm and Rudiger's actually got hold of him and it's just his putting his left arm out to get away from the defender I don't think there's anything in that no it just he just caught him with his hand and went down and I think the referee has an idea that something was was afoot yeah they've had a BAR check they've had a BAR check and that's the end of that not good play from Rudiger actually because he's actually thrown his arms around to the referee as if to point out that Nunes is elbowed him deliberately he didn't he tried to get off him because he was grabbing hold of him Antonio Rudiger though has been a round the block as Salah is fouled by Valverde three kick just over the halfway line well Liverpool and Fabinho was going to take a short three kick there and he's well he didn't get out of the way Vinicius and he is he's acting the he's acting the the put-up on the shocked individual that he's been shown a yellow card by the referee that um that's the letter of the law free kick to Liverpool so the big men need to stand up for Liverpool now they need to produce something very very special in the next half hour to be still in this tie Real Madrid have not lost at home in any competition this season incidentally he has natural natural at the halfway line the second leg in the Spanish capital in three weeks time Benzema playing it in field and then back it goes Real Madrid into their own half and uh pass from Rudiger finds Carvajal Rodrigo is there on the right hand side Benzema now it's steered back to Modric that's dangerous for Liverpool Modric in that kind of position but Núñez did well and Núñez has actually come out with the ball and Núñez bringing it forward still going but he's running the trouble centrally could have played it Salah and Gatbur on the run and now instead it's being played forward by Militão to Benzema who carries it out to the right hand side Benzema to the corner of the box Real Madrid no hurry now for them four two up clear two goal advantage Modric wouldn't surprise you in the slightest if if Modric now ran the show for the last half hour or so Liverpool are going to make another couple of changes or indeed their first two changes Jota and Firmino coming on and Napoli have taken a two-nil lead in Germany in the other first leg tie in the last 16 as Real Madrid with Carvajal with a cross it's over everyone inside the box bounces out into the right back position where Henderson will play it off the diving Valderdi and behind Chlorical kick Giovanni Di Lorenzo with a second goal for Napoli so the Italian league leaders winning two-nil in Germany against last year's Europa League winners Eintracht Frankfurt Núñez can't keep the ball in on the far side throwing the Real Madrid they need something Liverpool on and cheer up well such is the quality of this Real Madrid team Liverpool are finding it really difficult now because with their ability to to handle the ball in difficult situations of course when Liverpool are putting pressure on them to try and go forward you run the risk with the ability that they have up front that they punish it even more natural playing it forward stretch from Gomez bounces to Benzema Benzema taking it out towards the left-hand side Benzema then playing it across into the center circle Modric with a cushioned touch under no pressure to Camarvinga and then Carvajal back to Modric who's finding space that's a big worry and then the cross from Carvajal to the back post Benzema on side is able to take it down and give it back to Venetius on the left-hand side and have Liverpool are not careful there's a fifth Real Madrid goal coming here and then the shot is blasted in from distance by Rutigar optimistic that well-wide by four or five yards and it's a goal kick and Liverpool need something and here come the substitutes to see if they can make a difference Gatkoal and Núñez so Núñez who obviously was a a doubt for this game scored a brilliant goal to start the scoring this evening but off come the the two recent dish signings the two of them and on come well one of the great servants of this clock Liverpool team Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota who has had such a bad time with injury this season only just coming back a third consecutive substitute appearance for the Portuguese who's yet to score this season and here's Henderson who has the ball in fact it's a free kick fell on Alexander Arnold and Liverpool through the middle we've got 25 minutes so other sort of play plus added time four two to Real Madrid tomorrow night RB Leipzig against Manchester City you'll hear that live from Germany and Fabinho playing the ball to the left-hand side to Robertson who takes that down and plays it back to by Chetich middle of the half square to Fabinho Fabinho then rolls it forward Salah turns it in towards the edge of the box looking for Firmino but Real Madrid are all over him clear Gomez still wins it back Alexander Arnold crossing to the back post where it's tucked away behind by Carvajal he knew that he had Jota behind him so just turned it behind the far post recorder it's a magnificent ball from Trent Alexander Arnold just puts his head down whips it into the middle and he's got every right to ask why isn't there a Liverpool forward on the end of that such as that good ball met this Liverpool's first corner from the left-hand side so it is an out swing here it comes towards the penalty spot Salmino left for it but it was headed away comes out to by Chetich who tries to curl it and curls it narrowly wide from probably almost 30 yards out well Jordan Henderson wanted to take it him running the other way towards his own goal but by Chetich she's no leave it leave it for me and then he just tries to curl it but it's a good five or six yards wide go kick Real Madrid later scores in the matches tonight in the championship are Blackburn 1 Blackpool 0 still Millwall 0 the lead has Burnley 1 Norwich City winning 2-1 against Birmingham Rotherham winning 2-1 against Sunderland and Swansea 1 Stoke City 2 here's Alexander Arnold playing the ball in field for Fabinho Fabinho through the middle Jota Bill runs into Carvajal Camarvinga and then Rudiger back to Couquard long and left for it from him from the six yard box Van Dyke underneath this heads it forward to Gomez and now Alexander Arnold just lifts it further forward to Salah Rudiger was there with Salah put out of play by Valverde throwing for Alexander Arnold to take what she does into the path oh that's a poor touch by Fabinho Modric is under that Modric is away from by Chetich Modric finds finishes Benzema's unmarked in the D Benzema round Allison left foot finishes 5-2 Real Madrid the white shirts of Real Madrid jumping for joy on the Anfield pitch and that was from back to front inner flash Modric at the heart of it Vinicius involved as well but then Benzema with class and this might be over Liverpool 2 Real Madrid 5 you cannot make mistakes when there are world-class players waiting to punish you from Modric to Vinicius Junior from Vinicius Junior into Benzema who coolly comes back inside on the left foot and then tucks it into the top left hand corner the drive from Modric from midfield to go bust by Chetich and then find Vinicius Junior who then looks up into Benzema who sits Allison down on the edge of the box then has the ability and the confidence to take it onto the left foot has one little look and whips it in the top corner with his left foot it's a magnificent goal from Real Madrid and from Benzema class all over the park Modric there you know at the heart of that you'd think that Modric was the teenager wouldn't you the way the way he glides past the Liverpool midfield and has the strength to say get off me you're not going to catch me I'm too strong for you I'm too quick for you at his age and then have the ability to look up and find Vinicius Junior it's an incredible goal from Real Madrid well Anfield apart from that one section in the lower tier of the Anfield road end this ground so often so vibrant and so noisy on European nights in the cop down there all the flags have been put away and people are sitting quietly now red scarves draped around their necks and it's hard to see possibly any way back for Liverpool in this tie even though we've got over well over half of it to play well Kelly said to me before the game John what do you expect from Liverpool and I really and I said and I really meant it I didn't know what to expect because when you've been so poor for a long time and then you get the two results that that they had it doesn't mean you're back against a 10-man newcastle and when you make mistakes against the quality and the calibre of this team you're going to get punished and boy have they been punished tonight as Natio is forced by a long Allison goal kick to deflect the behind for a corner to Liverpool and yes Alan you're right well I mean it was difficult to know how to call this and and what to suggest we're going to go to Millwall in a moment but Liverpool have got a corner on the right hand side that Alexander-Arnold is waiting to take and Alexander-Arnold plays it in and it's headed straight at Courtois by Firmino actually who got up well but headed it straight at the Real Madrid goalkeeper who is able to drop onto the ground with it so back to the championship back to the den back to Millwall Aaron Paul equaliser for the home side Millwall one Burnley one Charlie Cresswell's corner was popped into the box it was headed down for Tom Bradshaw hat trick here on Saturday has he salvaged the point here for Millwall the den is alive John Vincent company urging his players to calm down they're rising to the occasion it's one one Liverpool to Real Madrid five and this remember from a position where Liverpool led two-nil with less than quarter of an hour to play so Real Madrid with the ball on the edge of their own penalty area and Natio on the left hand side to Camovinga Camovinga challenge Firmino just got a touch on that Firmino now wriggling away from Valverde who did well actually went down got the got the challenge in but Liverpool were there Henderson behind it Henderson controls it Salah was fouled off the ball it would seem ball played to the back post Robertson nods it back to the edge of the area but guess who's there for Real Madrid look at Modric getting in there ahead of Jota and Real Madrid have got it back halfway inside their own half and Camovinga will just pass the ball out towards the left hand side they are so confident they're so positive and sure of where they are the European champions the club world cup winners earlier this month super cup winners as well against soundtrack Frankfurt at the start of this season only Barcelona ahead of them at the top of the Spanish league and they'll play Barcelona next week in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final they've got Atletico Madrid to play this coming weekend in La Liga but all eyes on this all concentration on this and they've come here and they've done a job on Liverpool and actually with Liverpool losing by three goals this would this would equal their the heaviest home defeat in Europe which was previously 3-0 here against Real Madrid in 2014 and Real Madrid with Ruediga and then Natio playing it in James Milner's going to come on to Liverpool shortly Ruediga back to Natio again on the left hand side and then back it goes and Real Madrid now dominating possession Liverpool can't get close to them Ruediga this is this is turned into a nightmare for Liverpool a chase in shadows they can't get near Real Madrid full of confidence full of belief incredible ability particularly that man Modric I mean if there's one guy who you don't want to be up against in world football when you're chasing the game it's that guy the belief that he has on the his ability his little one touches his little give and go and he's vision so another double change Matip is going to come on for Liverpool at the back and James Milner as well as I mentioned so Joe Gomez next way for him and he has just he's been on the rough end of of so much tonight deflections you know certainly he could have been closer to the finishes for the first goal that Real Madrid scored but Matip comes on to replace him and it is Jordan Henderson who makes way for James Milner who will take the captain's arm bound so that is four substitutions that Liverpool have made we've got still almost 20 minutes to play more so wondering you know five goals Liverpool conceding five goals at Anfield I wonder when the last time that happened was ball on the left hand side with Jota you're not looking for an answer are you not sure where to start with that here's Firmino out to the left hand side if you come up with that I would have been very impressed I'm always impressed when you're sitting next to me but I would have been super impressed as Thomas Tucho would say balls out of play for a goal kick to Real Madrid and Jürgen Klopp down there cutting a very isolated figure hands in his pockets black cap pull down Liverpool are looking for a miracle and Modric who coming how many times would be said it of him he is just ageless and Milner playing the ball across comes to the edge of the penalty area where Mili Tau was there to whack it away downfield and then Mathip is able to head it back to Allyson actually Giulietti who's with us he just pointed out remember the 5-5 drawing the league cup which actually wasn't that long ago and I was here for that so I should have remembered that should have remembered it's all right you're that stage in your life yeah so when was the last time that score considered five goals in a european tie here's Mathip who's bringing it forward and giving it to Milner on the right hand side Milner away from Carvajal but it feels like it's gone now it does you know whether Liverpool are able to raise themselves as I say there's still 15 minutes left in this game but it now feels that that's not happening that Real Madrid are in control what they're doing really well is is that when Liverpool have the ball they're actually doing going into a 4-5-1 with that guy who would be in Raven tonight about all night and Vinicius Jr on the left he's tucking in that left and making a five-man midfield and doing his work defensively so at the minute there's no way through ball comes to Milner flicks from him but the flicks aren't coming off now straight to Ruediga and now here is Vinicius but Alexander-Arnold comes in and it's deflected out of play and hopefully our friends at ESPN are saying that this is the first time that Liverpool have conceded five goals in a Champions League match you know so we couldn't think the one oh that's sort of come from Kelly Kelly sent us that well thank you Kelly Kelly Kates but this is five live radio Merseyside I'm not sure will there have any listeners left from Radio Merseyside, everything supporters tuned in on that and BBC sounds here's Salah on the right hand side Salah down for Milner Milner right footed cross taken down by Jotart no it just got away from him had his back to goal got his right foot to it and it's cleared away downfield by Real Madrid comes back for Carvajal and Real Madrid with Ruediga playing it out towards the far side and Liverpool win it back brought forward by Robertson Robertson towards the dead ball line but there's cover there Militio comes across and blocks it behind cornered Liverpool low and you can see Clintus' fist there as he blocks that Militio you can see right in front of the in front of the Cop good play from Robertson though need more of that they need more energy corner from the left hand side in front of the Cop the silent Cop Robertson raises his right arm he has to delivery into the near post but can't beat the first man there Carvajal was in position the bearded Carvajal 31 years old gets that away by Chetich with a long diagonal pass looking for Mattip we tried to swing it across on the sprint the substitute the centre of the fender couldn't get it to it it's behind for a goal kick got another got another statistical note coming your way Alan in a moment it's a from our friend Stapman Dave who says this is the first time Liverpool have conceded five goals at Anfield in this competition Champions League European Cup so an historic night in the sense that Liverpool did not want no and they've been too easy to play through particularly this second half I mean it was all looking ever so good when they were two nil open you're thinking yes this could be the turning point for them but then the way Real Madrid have bounced back in the fashion that they have and just Liverpool have played too open yes they've got unbelievable ability in that midfield Real Madrid but if you stick together and you're tight and you make it difficult for the opposition you get men behind the ball and and then it should be harder than it has been for me know getting the ball down on the right hand side but Real Madrid five two up first time that Liverpool have conceded five goals here at Anfield in this competition that they are so fond of Camervinga clearing the ball away I feel like I should return the compliment to Statman Dave by saying listen to the 606 fantasy football podcast with Statman Dave on BBC sounds here's Salah moving in from the right hand side natural the challenge but Salah kept possession Fabinho but we've got ten white shirts parked behind the ball and the dangerous Benzema lurking in the centre circle should Real Madrid break away and and how they broke away for that fifth goal Milner infield towards Alexander Arnold now by Chetich by Chetich curling it out towards the far side Robertson is there Robertson back to the edge of the area Jota by Chetich right footed this is a high one to the right hand side taken down by Alexander Arnold then Salah back again centrally to the middle of the half to buy Chetich then Robertson again on the left hand side but Real Madrid are just sitting in there and and Liverpool are just finding it so hard to to fight try and pick away through them Fabinho now away from Benzema and Valverde to his left to buy Chetich Robertson plays it on beyond Rodrigo but Carvajal was there just to shepherd it behind and then as you do when your five two up turns to Robertson who went to ground and helps him up are you okay everything okay yeah come on yep so another change for Real Madrid and it is Rodrigo who's making way and it's going to be another of the Real Madrid stars Danny Sabayos the former Arsenal low knee who's going to to come on to replace him full time so the 745 reaching their full-time whistles so to Millwall Aaron Paul Millwall won Burnley won the point shared in a proper championship battle Ashley Barnes put the visitors ahead with the touch of fortune as the ball dropped him in the box Tom Bradshaw's equaliser had the same level of fortune as he lashed home with five minutes to go Burnley's lead now 12 points at the summit Millwall go into fifth Millwall won Burnley won put the cat among the pitchers wouldn't it if Millwall got promoted to the Premier League at the end of this season having a very good season the other full-time scores they're all coming in Blackburn one of your old clubs Alan have beaten Blackpool in the Northwest Derby 1-0 Millwall won Burnley won as we've just heard from Aaron Norwich City 3-1 winners in the end against Birmingham Stokes City have scored again 3-1 up and they've beaten Swansea Swansea 1 Stokes City 3 and they're still playing where Rotherham are 2-1 up on Sunderland in League 1 Fleetwood 1 Cambridge United 0 and Morecom 1 Port Vale 0 and not many goals in League 2 running through the scores in the moment the four matches that Real Madrid have the ball back Valverde intercepted the pass from by Chetich and it goes back to Courtois so in League 2 Grimsby Town 0 Harrogate Town 0 Hartleypool United 0 Newport County 1 bottom of the table Rochdale have lost at home to Stockport 2-1 who are pushing for promotion this season and Walsall 0 crew 0 it finished Liverpool with a ball on the right hand side with Alexander Arnold but Naturopoulos able to get a foot in and it bounces away for Real Madrid and Benzemaan now half wins side his own half plays at round one side of Salah Cronk out there it's out of play throwing the Liverpool Hamilton 2 in Vanessa 1 in the championship in Scotland Albion Rovers 3 Elgin City 0 and still playing Eintracht Frankfurt 0 Napoli 2 the latest in the other match in the first legs tonight Plymouth 1 Cheltenham 1 is the latest score in the in the EFL trophy semi-final so we've got less than 10 minutes to play about eight minutes actually plus added time and it's the Real Madrid supporters you can hear in the rest of Anfield whether it's the Cop or the Kenny Dalglish stand or the main stand here there's a little bit of a pause down there for James Milner blocking the ball out for a throw or the other Liverpool supporters in the Anfield roll and after it was so loud so vibrant in the early stages when Liverpool were on top and scoring their two goals it is Shrove Tuesday today and I'm afraid it has gone as flat as the proverbial here's Militao passing it out to Modric and then Rudiger, Nacho and Modric with his right foot but that's cut out by the the right leg of Alexander-Arnold by Chetitzen plays it over the top easy for Rudiger just to head it down above Firmino now Nacho sets off down the left hand side Nacho taking the ball a long long way all shoved over by Alexander-Arnold No says the referee I thought I saw his hands go to the back of Nacho who can't believe he hasn't got a free kick but Liverpool have got it so did I I thought Trent got got away with one there because he Nacho's away from him and he's chasing him and he does push him from behind and the referee I think's got a good view there but he chooses not to give the free kick luckily for Liverpool time running out tonight seven minutes to go I think there's going to be another Liverpool change shortly I don't know how many times you were in this kind of position Alan but I mean it's just a case of what kind of score the ball comes across Salah was almost in but Nacho comes across did well actually Firmino trying to find a way through but it bounces away Militao defended it well and Militao passes it forward and then Valverde he's got it on the right hand side it's horrible it really is horrible because you are chasing shadows when you're up against ability like Modric and Benzeman, Vinicius Jr and Camarvinger guys who are so comfortable on the ball it's hard enough when it's nil nil let alone when you're losing by three goals and a two leg tie though Fabinho carrying the ball forward towards the edge of the box but it's all rather ponderous this Firmino threw into the box and then Jota getting the crossover comes off Carverhouse as the referee it's a corner to Liverpool and Rotherham have won Rotherham have beaten Sunderland by two goals to one not one in five so that's their first win in six matches and clearly a blow for Sunderland at the other end of the table corner for Liverpool Harvey Elliott coming on though first of all for by Cepic in the midfield and it's been a tough school today for by Cheddington the midfield against this lot no he looked back and he certainly learned from this how it could and perhaps should be done but he tried hard and worked hard he never gave up but he's up against some of the very very best in there tonight it was always going to be difficult for him Alexander-Arnold with the corner for Liverpool that's easily headed away stooping forward Carverhouse was able to unchallenged headed away to the halfway line so if you've just switched on to us on five live already on Merseyside listening on BBC sounds it was 2-0 to Liverpool Darwin Nunez and Salah and the place was absolutely rocking at that stage Valverde playing the ball forward and Vinicius Jr who did the damage in the first half scoring two goals to draw it level first a brilliant finish the second charging down in allison clearance so 2-2 at halftime but Carlo Ancelotti's team have just taken it away from Liverpool in the in the second half and now he's going to make another couple of changes and Tony Cross he wasn't even in the country this morning is going to come on Benzema off saved for for greater challenges you have to say coming up in the next week Benzema has applauded off by actually many of the Liverpool fans as well inside the ground Marco Asensio great champions league pedigree that he's got as well and uh and also I thought that might happen Benzema off and Modric as well Atletico Madrid to play at the weekend Barcelona to play next week not bad soaps to Cumbama Antonio Asensio and Tony Cruz well I know I know how does he keep going in Modric by the way how does he keep going 37 years old he's still talking about playing on for Croatian isn't he well looking at him tonight the way he's done overlaps the way he's protected the back four the way his ability on the ball to control the midfield as he has done I'm not surprised this is his 468th appearance for Real Madrid I remember and he had four years at Tottenham before that what a player what an athlete and uh and what what really struck you possibly actually what I'll remember about this is the way that he went away from Paj Cetic the teenager just a surging run to set up I think that was the fifth goal wasn't it for Real Madrid the 37 year old running away from the 18 year old incredible last stages tonight we'll be on air five live sports I'll have past 10 tonight if you don't hear the reaction what Jürgen Klopp has to say about this and Carlo Ancelotti as well that'll be on the five live football daily podcast in the morning from BBC Sound where we also have on there new 50 years of rapper Benitez if you're a Liverpool supporter and want some happier European memories you'll find them there uh with um rapper Benitez on BBC Sound and also the new Jermaine de Faux outside the box podcast they're all turning broadcasting now Alan yeah turn into that one if you want to go to sleep it can work can work actually that kind of thing actually you mentioned by Cetic you know he do well looking at the yeah at the video of this game and looking at Modric and his performance and his attitude cross I thought cross might have been fell there Liverpool bring it forward Salah he has Elliot Elliot into the game but crosses it into Rudiger and it bounces out of play for a throwing to Liverpool near the corner flag Alexander Arnold takes it down and in it goes now into the edge of the penalty area to Flameno who couldn't control it Real Madrid clear it hit the referee actually but the referee's left play to continue with Nacho and Nacho into the centre circle to Valverde Liverpool quickly back in position certainly don't want a sixth goal on this night of unwanted history for Liverpool conceding five goals in the Champions League here at Antioch he's doing well in there as well in the midfield Camo Vinga mind you they all have they've all been outstanding so Marco Asensio over there on the right hand side it comes back centrally and played forward by Ceballos coming on into the midfield remember those two years that he had at Arsenal and now Nacho at the back we're in the 90th minute now Real Madrid in possession the cop won a little bit more than this from their Liverpool team instead it's Real Madrid who continue to come forward Nacho surging forward whenever he gets the chance and they really are thinking of absolutely making sure of this Real Madrid if they can Carvajal on the right hand side comes back to Ceballos Valverde is there now Camo Vinga and Camo Vinga as well you know what a beautifully economical player he is superb he's linked up really well the understanding that him and Modric have had in the midfield tonight yeah it's worked perfectly for them yeah and you can see can't you that he learned from Casamiro when he was it's like watching Casamiro isn't it a younger version Casamiro who will be involved against Barcelona all being well on Thursday night as Real Madrid come forward again so tomorrow night Arby Leipzig against Manchester City Thursday night Manchester United against Barcelona the England Belgium matches on Sport Extra tomorrow night and the Arnold Clark Cup and then Saturday big games as well Leicester City against Arsenal our three

afternoon join us for all of that five live the only place where you will be able to hear all of that and indeed this live from Anfield here's Firmino through the middle jot out bounces off him and Militao is able to get a touch in on it Real Madrid come forward again some have left now there are empty seats appearing can't see too many empty seats on the cop but what a sobering night it's been the right Liverpool with the ball in the middle into the penalty area Salas after that was challenged by Nacho went down the referee's having none of that and he's helped up by by the same player natural pulls him up onto his feet no complaints from Liverpool throwing on the left hand side it's finished Eintracht Frankfurt nil Napoli two in the first leg in the other tie tonight I know many Alan are fencing maybe Napoli could be the Champions League winners this season I know they've got their sights set on winning the league in Italy having not done it for such a long time he has Jotter on the edge of the penalty area bounces back to Salah on the edge of the box but advances to cross and Real Madrid clear it away and Matip will knock it in field to Van Dyke and they are staying so they can sing you'll never walk along and that's what it's all about really to do that on occasions such as this yeah it's been a tough night for them really has been a tough night for them despite the start that they had no one ever saw this come and did they the way that Real Madrid have actually just demolished Liverpool particularly in the midfield areas where they've just passed it around for fun and Liverpool have not been able to get near them a free kick for a foul on that show the yellow card as well I think for Elliott for that challenge so yellow card for Harvey Elliott but it's it's it's rather sobering isn't it this week and last week for the the mighty Premier League in the in the Champions League Chelsea and Tottenham losing 1-0 away not able to score a goal between them and now Liverpool 5-2 down at home against Real Madrid yeah it is absolutely yeah but this team's a special team with some very very good players with a wily old manager who's been there and done it everywhere he's been and know how to go to places like Anfield and get a result and hence as I was about to say people think about maybe Napoli in the Champions League but who would bet against Real Madrid and certainly after what they've done here to Liverpool and the recent revival has been stopped juttering in its tracks by the Champions League holders the club world cup winners who've come here and inflicted a record equaling defeat in terms of margin on Liverpool in Europe at Anfield and also the first time Liverpool have conceded five goals in this competition here at Anfield 5-2 Alan Shearer well you've seen a masterclass and how not to panic how to have belief in your ability keep going the way you wanted to where to play and stick to the tactics that the manager's given you and eventually something to turn but it helps when you've got the brilliance of Venetius Jr up front when you've got the know-how of Benzema who's been there and done it before when you've got the brilliance of Moderich in midfield with the energy and the youth of Camarvinga in and around him so this is an experienced team with an experienced manager who've done it before at the highest level and they have punished Liverpool tonight in a heavy way so there we are Liverpool 2-0 up inside the first 15 minutes through Nunes and Salah but then Liverpool five conceded five goals without reply five goals without reply 2-2 at halftime 2 for Venetius Jr then Milletow as the Real Madrid players go to their supporters and then two for the great Karim Benzema as well we didn't know quite what to expect tonight we found it hard to predict it didn't it but I don't think anyone expected this kind of Spanish Inquisition Liverpool 2 Real Madrid five John Murray and Alan Shearer at Anfield for that Champions League round of 16 first leg Alan as you've just been reflecting on with John and we'll come to the the Liverpool Deficiency season in a moment but this is just a Real Madrid side who yes their form has been up and down this season but their affinity with this tournament their skills and their talent that they have in this side just shone through particularly from about halfway through the first half yeah they didn't panic when they went 2-0 down nothing changed they stuck to their game plan and then as I said when you've got the ability of him in midfield moderate so the way he controls it his his belief in who and what's around him he's little one touch and he's gives and he goes and and then you've got the energy of Camarvinga in and around him but the brilliance of those two up front in Venetius Jr and Benzema you give them an opportunity you were going to get punished and that's exactly what Liverpool did I mean the first one yes that Gomez could have got closer to to Vinicius he might have blocked the shot if he did but the way he picks his spot and knocks it past the the goalkeeper and Allison's got no chance and then we're thinking what's going to happen in the second half when it's 2-2 and you think okay it's not a bad result for Liverpool to go over there and but but then you see in the brilliance and the way moderate just goes past by Chechich in the midfield as if to say get off me you're not going to stay with me and then for him to find the to find Venetius Jr on the left and the way he put it into Benzema and then what you're talking about you're talking about killers up front who if you give them an opportunity they're going to take it and Liverpool give them too many tonight and it's a harsh lesson it's been a harsh lesson for Liverpool with that 5-2 defeat at Anfield we'll be reflecting much more on that",
