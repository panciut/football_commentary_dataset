 In the top six tiers in England who are yet to score this season, as we're under way, and Aston Villa playing from left to right as we look. Martinez in a lemon yellow, short sleeve shirts. Are you surprised he's been brought back in after obviously he was instigating a move or looking to get away from the club? No, not at all. He's one of the best goalkeepers in world football. I think there was an element of the move was getting forced upon him because of the money that he's actually on and he wants him to shift wages. But he's a fantastic goalkeeper and the back line will be delighted that he's back in goal. Stephen Warlock is with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live. We're also available on the BBC Sounds app. More choices to listen than ever before. And you think that this weekend we've got the world athletics, the boxing, the golf, the horse racing, the cricket, Premier League football, the women's World Cup, rugby union. And no wonder that Sports Extra and Stream, Sports Extra 2 and 3 will give you a choice of listening. If you don't want the football. But this is the usual goal service in Aston Villa. Caught in possession in midfield, McGinn, and Grealish against his former club. Picked up a few goons there from the Aston Villa travelling support. I think there are still a few late arrivals, aren't they? What was it? A horse on the rail tracks at nearby Formby. Yeah, something like that. But everyone seems to be in. It seems packed, doesn't it? I mean, I was quite surprised how many empty seats there were. It was about five minutes to go before kickoff, but now seems like everyone's in. 52,769 is the capacity here for the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Bramley Mordok in Liverpool. This bold design as Beto looks to hold the ball up. Bit of a tussle there with Mings. Mings goes to ground and gets back to his feet quickly. Plays it forward as Buendia. And then there was a little bit of hesitation from Dynia, and that allowed N'Jai to nip him to the feet of Beto. And Jai is up with him on the right-hand side. Here is N'Jai, right corner of the area, enters the box, and Jai with a cross, Beto stubbed it. He had a real opportunity to hit it first time and gets a clean strike. That's going goalwards. But he didn't, and it's likely he might have stood, he's standing leg, he's gone behind for a goal kick. We're going to go racing. The Park Stakes at Doncaster. John Hunt. There are halfway here, a seven-furlong trip in. The Group 2 Park Stakes and the field taken along by frontrunner Queen Olt. He's out in front by two lengths. Room service struggling at the back end of the field. Queen Olt leader is chased by Marvell Man in the early stages. Audience is there on the outside, followed now by Kings Gamble in fourth place, in fifth, and pushed along is Zoom Zoom. And then comes the well-fansied Shadow of Light, but only sixth or seventh for the favourite, as now Marvell Man sweeps to the front. Furl under go. Marvell Man goes on by two lengths. Audience giving vain chase. So too Queen Olt is struggling on. Next to him is Kings Gamble, but this is the easiest winner of the day so far. Marvell Man roms to victory in the Park Stakes. For trainer Andrew Boulding, he's won by five lengths, and Boulding has both further and outside Attarians to come in the St. Ledger. Thank you, John, and we'll be back in good time for you. That race at Doncaster for the St. Ledger is due off at 340. You've not missed anything whilst we've been away, because Beto's effort, he did strike his standing leg and went behind for a goal kick. Tyro Mingz has gone down, and as soon as Tyro Mingz goes to ground with an injury, you think, I hope it's not his knees. Yeah, I was just trying to see whether it is his knee or his calf. It was obviously Illumin in Jai, did great down that right-hand side, and as he went down the right-hand side, he got in a 1v1 situation, but the actual injury occurred before that instance, and he's hobbling as he gets put in a 1v1 situation with Illumin in Jai. So this is a real concern for Aston Villa and for Tyro Mingz. Well, Tyro Mingz is back on his feet, but he is walking rather gingerly at the moment. We'll get an update from Bournemouth, Sir Hel Sahi. Bournemouth has played Bournemouth nil, Brighton nil, but a disruption to the Brighton 11. Jack Husslewood is off after twisting his right ankle in a challenge with Evan Nielsen. Yassin Ayari has replaced him. Bournemouth nil, Brighton nil. Aston Villa are down to 10 temporarily. Tyro Mingz is just trying to run it off on that far side. But Unai Emery has actually told Pao Torres just to step up his warming up as he limbers on the touchline here at Everton's new home. Niel nil in the early stages, four and a half minutes play. Well, there should be 1-0 down, Aston Villa. It's a brilliant chance for Beto, and as it comes across to his right foot, he miscues it with his right foot, and it hits his standing left foot. It's a shocker from Beto. It's a simple tapping. You must say that should be 1-0. We welcome listeners to the BBC World Service. Wherever you are in the world, it is a pleasure to have your company here at Everton's new home, where it is nil-nil between Everton and Aston Villa. Port Vale, who are yet to win this season in League 1, though have taken the lead at St James's Park, Exeter City nil. Port Vale 1 is the latest score in League 1, and Mingz, who had been off the field for the last two minutes, is back and able to participate. So whether you're listening on the World Service, five live or through the BBC Sounds app, they had torrential rain probably about an hour ago, but now the sun is shining. There's a pocket of blue sky away towards our left-hand side as McGinn. Closed down by Irribunam. You think of Irribunam and Dean Nehring-Grealish. There are a number of players in this respective starting 11s coming up against the former clubs, this Illiman and Jai. It was a doubt coming into the game, but he looks rather sprightly, picks it up, darts forward, lays it off towards Jewsbury Hall, now out towards Grealish. And Grealish waits on this left-touch line, running on his toes as Cash backpedals. Grealish teasing him, dragging the ball slowly with that right leg. And then in field to Irribunam, now with Keane. Every outfield player in the Aston Villa half, Everton attacking, the North stand from right to left. This is Gae, back with Tarkovsky. There's a confidence, isn't there, about Everton-Steven? Yeah, there's a difference in the way that they set up as well. Now you've got two wide players who like to take people on in Grealish and Jai, and they've got problem-causers for the opposition. And that's exactly what you want now. It's about getting with the look more confident in possession. I just wanted to touch on Aston Villa though. I'm very surprised that you've got John McGinn on the right-hand side when you've got James Garner playing left back. Well, McGinn's going to come in on his stronger left foot, and that suits James Garner. Here is Jai, right-to-one challenge. Referee Simon Hooper. I thought maybe he had a good look, and it might have given a free kick there to Everton, but he says instead it will be a goal kick. And Jai has looked extremely sharp. And he was part of that Senegal side that went to the top of their group in world-class qualifying in dramatic fashion. Coming from 2-0 down to beat Diar Congo 3-2. It also got a good win against Sudan as well. So, and Jai has certainly had a rather eventful international break. As Emi Martinez is eventually going to be closed down by Jusbri Hall. The goal kick was taken short. Everton oppressing, high up the pitch. Cash. Now with concert, and he caught in possession. Here is Jusbri Hall. He tees up gay, tries to place it, blocks. Mike Volta-Grealish wouldn't sit for him. Grealish tries to kill it now. Far post on the stretch. Beto's header clawed out, flags up. The whistle had gone. They're appealing for handball, but the whistle had gone because of the flag was up. But Ashton Villa again under real pressure. Well, it's still played out from the back and get caught, and everyone wonders why you try and play out from the back. And it's a dangerous ball from Konza into the midfield. Into Bogart, he gets caught in possession. He's too slow, gets his pocket picked. But the ball in from Grealish to the back post from Beto. Yes, it was offside, but the save. That's why he's playing Martinez, outstanding save. Did ever so well. Strong left hand, just managed to claw it away as he reached towards that top corner, his top left hand corner. Nil Nillet remains. Commentsary on Sports Extra, his new Castle walls. Mike Minay has the latest. And it is Nil Nil, Hwang close, twice in the opening minute, one shot deflected from the resultant corner of volley that forced Pope into a save. Murphy's had a dipping shot just wide for the home side, but it is still Newcastle Nil, Wolves Nil. Been a strong start from Everton. It's been a very good start from Everton, quick. Obviously the new ground, the noise around the stadium, it's really picked the Everton players up. But one thing you said to me before was the difference in Everton, their athletic up front. That's the difference that they bought into this team. That's what they've added. Crystal Palace Sunderland, John Bennett. It's Nil Nil, but Sunderland are looking really confident. Adiara Cross almost picking out Isidore. Crystal Palace restricted to a lern-mash or over, Nil Nil. And they're not afraid to go direct. I thought I was quite safe in handing to John there, and Tarkovsky all of a sudden has hit a long pass. It must have been a good 50, 60 yards, drops over the shoulder and just got away from Beto. But as it went over the head, it was Mingz, wasn't it? Yeah, Mingz just didn't read the flight to the ball. I think he thought it was going closer to his goalkeeper, and whether his goalkeeper might have come and claimed it. But Beto, a loose touch, very difficult skill to bring it down. Might have been better trying to hit it first time as it dropped over his shoulder. But it's all Everton at the moment, and Matty Kacznall concedes a free kick in a dangerous position. Barnsley lead Reading by a goal to Nil in League One at Oakwell. And another goal in South Yorkshire is at Hillsborough, Sheffield Wednesday, Nil, Bristol City, one. We'll get news of that after this free kick. Which Everton are going to take. It's level with the penalty area on the left-hand side. Jusbree Hall and Garner are the two standing over it. Aston Villa have got everybody back. Good noise inside the impressive arena here, down by the docks in Liverpool. Seamus Coleman is just starting to warm up. So Garner with the in-swinger, Jusbree Hall with the out-swinger. Nil, Nil. Garner's going to leave it. Jusbree Hall to take it, and it comes now, and the header from Michael Keeney is off target. So I promised that goal at Hillsborough, Betty Glover. Bad start for Sheffield Wednesday. It's been coming for Bristol. Balls swung in. Scott Twine cut the ball back. Dickie ran on to it and got it into the back of the net. Easy as you like. Sheffield Wednesday, Nil, Bristol City, one. Sheffield Wednesday, who are yet to win. Bristol City, who are actually still unbeaten this season. And then Martinez again is going to eventually clear his lines from another short goal kick. And once again, it's met by a blue shirt in Everton. In fact, Tarkovsky was fouled. Aston Villages can't get into the game. No, they can't. They can't get a foothold. The ball out from Martinez wasn't great into Buendia. Tarkovsky stepped out off Oli Watkins and won the first ball. And I think you say that the finding, struggling to find a foothold in the game, but Everton, great start so far within the first 12 minutes. Jusbree Hall has also had a rather impressive early start to his Everton career. He's actually played more minutes before today, 270 minutes in the Premier League than he did throughout his Premier League time at Chelsea. And no English player has created more chances so far in the top flight as Grealish holds off Rodgers back towards Ghana. And Ghana will go all the way back to Irebunem to Pickford. Pickford just plays it out of his penalty area in green away towards their right. Downfield it goes. Headed away by Buendia before it can reach better. Irebunem now slides in, out it goes for a throw on that far side. Aaron Ball is Aaron Pauls at Craven Cottage, Fullham Leeds. Nel Nel here, Fullham Nel leads Nel. Really bitey feisty battle between these two sides. No concrete chances, but Fullham with a free kick and a dangerous position over on the far side. Harry Wilson stepping up to take it. Nel Nel. With an athletic leading Doncaster Rovers by a goal to Nel in League 1. It's the goal service and the commentary here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Ball up towards Watkins, Tarkovsky will usher that ball all the way back to Jordan Pickford. Away towards our right-hand side. Pickford is 450th club appearance of his career. As again, Everton prepared to go direct up towards Beto. Makes that run in behind Doncaster. Pickford's England teammate lays it off towards Greeley. He's quickly on the attack, running with purpose into the penalty area left-hand side. Plays it back, Jewsbury Hall looks at his options. Garner provides the support now from left back. Back to Jewsbury Hall. Here once again is Garner cutting in now off the left. Touchline lays it off and the ball from Irribunam back towards Keen. And then Keen will go back towards Pickford. They are playing with a degree of control, 13 minutes in, Nel Nel. Yeah, they had an opportunity there to swing the ball into the box. They refused it. Thought Garner was just going to whip it in on that right forecourt. Beto's a willing runner. He really is. He makes some great runs in behind. He stretches the backline of Aston Villa. It's just a shame he's finishing. He just doesn't have that confidence in front of goal because, as we said earlier on, Everton should have been 1-0 up. And this is a new thing this season, isn't it? Long throws. Yes. Going back to the old school of long throws. Old school is new school, said Chris Wilder as the league managers association many a long time ago. As in comes the throw, flicks on. Mind you, there's a few Sheffield United fans who still wish they had Chris Wilder in charge. I was going to say the same he said. My word. Grass isn't always greener. No. Heading away by Irribune. What a sorry start it has been for the Blades. Losing last night 5-0 at Ipswich. And Sheffield Wednesday. Not a good time for the Steel City. Whichever year, allegiance in that part of the world. Here's the blue and white of Everton. They've made their best start in four seasons. However, Rogers picks up on a loose ball but it was a weak forward ball towards Watkins and easily cut out by Tarkovsky. Look back at Everton. Everton have failed to win any of their opening five games in the last three seasons. New surroundings, new start, new feel. And Grealish on this near side, the left. Back towards Jewsbury Hall. Wigan Athletic have got a second goal. They now lead Doncaster Rovers by two goals to nil. Doncaster, who'd won their last five going into that game. And Jai rolls away from Dynia. Runs forward, low cross into the penalty area. And it's cleared by Bogard out for an Everton throw. John Bennett's at Crystal Palace. Crystal Palace nil, Sunderland nil, Sunderland. Continue to be the better side. Noah Siddiqui with a chance left-footed shot, tight angle over the bar and wide. Crystal Palace nil, Sunderland nil. Talking of Sheffield United, you'd have seen Illiman and Jai many a time at Bramble Lane. And he's back in English football after that. Spal at Marseille. But he is one of those players who you enjoy to watch. He just glides across the service from the long throw. Better with a turn, strikes Tarkovsky, falls to Grealish. Saved by the legs of Martinez, spooned up in the air. And in the end, it was Mings, who has to get there before his own goalkeeper to head it behind for a corner kick. Blingwood leave, walks all by a goal to nil. Musta took a deflection from the shot from Grealish because it just wrong-footed Emi Martinez in the Aston Villa goal. But it's that long throw in. Crystal, Michael Keane gets the first flick on and then he keep it alive. And as it falls to the feet of Grealish, really good strike low. Is it just a matter of time before Everton make the breakthrough? Luchentown nil, Plymouth one in League One. Bristol Rovers one, Barrow nil is the latest score in League Two. You're up to date, five live in the World Service. Everton have a corner kick right-hand side. Jewsbury Hall, an orthodox from the goalkeeper with a referee's whistle has blown. Ghana had knocked the ball into the empty net, but the whistle had long since blown. I can only imagine now I say on orthodox because he must have been held away that somehow he managed to get a left hand to it as he fell to the ground. Jack Grealish had hold of his other arm, sort of interlocked if you like. And Emi Martinez couldn't get off the ground, could only get a single hand to it and a punch and a referee saw it straight away, Simon Hooper. Now Aston Villa with Bwendir, placing out to Farside to Dynia, back with Bwendir. We've got world title boxing on five live tonight. In fact, the undercard will start at seven o'clock on Sports Extra Two, but that fight in Belfast between Lewis Crocker and Paddy Donovan is at five live at ten. And in boxing parlance here, Aston Villa are on the ropes. They certainly are. They're trying to find a way out of this press from Everton. They're trying to make sure that Everton can't play long direct balls, but Unai Emery hasn't moved out of his technical area down in front of us. He is not happy at all. Well, they've got a throw, have Aston Villa, which is down by the corner flag as they play from left to right, attacking that giant south stand that holds 13,000 supporters. Cash waits to take it. And then that was surely a foul throw. That gives us an opportunity to hear of a goal at Bournemouth to Hellside. Bournemouth have the lead, Bournemouth one, Brighton nil. It's come out of nothing the ball was bobbling about on the edge of the area. Alex Scott picked it up, turned beautifully, last hit home, left footed, 18 yards out, what a finish. Bournemouth one, Brighton nil. And an opportunity to put Everton under pressure, and then that happens. Such a poor throw from Matty Cash. And again, you look at Unai Emery's body language, shrugging the shoulders, sort of looking down at the floor, not impressed. One bit by Matty Cash. But they haven't started well, Villa. They need to up the game because if they don't, it could be a long, long afternoon. Gay actually strikes him and runs away from him the ball, and Telemans then will tie it up for Aston Villa. Mings then passes the ball out towards Deena. Will he keep the ball in play? Yes, he will. That's like Celery to do so, down by the corner flag. Deena now with a cross. O'Brien is there to head it away on the near side of the six-yard box. Telemans plays the ball back to... Concert. His forward ball, Wendia able to turn to Rogers. Rogers, his challenge almost falls into the path of Wendia. Keen will clear. Beto and Mings. No foul, says Simon Hooper, as Mings comes away with the ball over on that far side. Now it's with Rogers, leaving it for Wendia. Stepping into the challenge was Tarkovsky, and then giving it now to Irribunin. And Irribunin will run forward with it towards the halfway line. Gay has gone out wide on the right-hand side, drops to his knees. Simon Hooper will say that will be a free kick. When you look at the various clubs in the Premier League who have players on international duty, Everton had eight, only Leeds United of the Premier League clubs had fewer on international duty with five. So in that respect, David Moyes would have had a... Still, I would guess, a nucleus of this squad that he's been able to work with. Yeah, but it depends how you manage that time. Do you over-train the players? Do you under-train them? How much time do you give them off with it being so early on in the season? I was actually flying out last Friday to Spain. I saw one of the Everton players in the airport as well, so they obviously have been given a little bit of time off. But it's how you manage it. It's not as simple as just saying, oh, you get rest. Rest doesn't mean everything in football. You've still got to keep them active and busy. Ball up towards Beto, tries to stab it back into the path of Anjai. And Dina, who was the left back, just took in, was able to win it back for Aston Villa. That's Stephen Warnock who's offering us the insight for the England international, of course. Oh, wow. As the referee has given a free kick here. I thought he'd taken the ball cleanly. Yeah, I don't understand that. We need to see it again. Tarkovsky with his head in his hands, wondering how, and you can hear what the thoughts are in and around the fans. But straight away, I thought he'd won the ball. Goal at Coventry, Mark Webber. Where it's Coventry, 0, Norwich, 1. Against the Urana of early play, Messiah's Christgarden from Norwich, weaved into the area and managed to find space to slot it home to make it Coventry City, 0. Norwich City, 1. You can actually see the words of James Tarkovsky saying, I got the ball with which he did in the challenge with Morgan Rogers, and then his mouth, that's a joke. Yeah, he's saying the follow-through, Simon Hooper, is not right from James Tarkovsky. There's got to be contact in football. There's too many challenges now, where if you collide with a player, or there's a little bit of follow-through, that's called momentum, and that is part of football. No action was taken. Didn't see a yellow card from the referee, Simon Hooper. Peterbury united, a leading wickham by a goal to nil. Peterborough, who are yet to win. In fact, they haven't actually won since the 1st of April, against a wickham side without an away win in League 1 this season. And Bristol City have got a second goal at Hillsborough. Sheffield Wednesday, no, Bristol City 2. Luton have equalised, Luton won, Plymouth won, and you're up to date. As we will get an update from St James' Park, Mike Mane. 21 minutes played, nil-nil. The Premier League's bottom side, Wolves giving themselves a really good account at the moment, testing the Newcastle defence. But you were talking of long throws not so long ago. Liberamento from the left-hand, side-course chaos. Murphy ghosting in on the back of the six-yard box. He'd hit it straight at Sam Johnston. Newcastle, nil-wolves, nil. Greenish, edge of the area. Doesn't shoot, comes back inside, and will win a corner. Comments with that one, by the way, Newcastle Wolves is on sports extra. Everton, the momentum is still with the home side. Stoke City won, Birmingham Mill is the latest scorer championship. Steven. Yeah, well, they're winning every second ball Everton in that midfield area. Aston Villa really struggling to win those competitive battles. And then, in wide areas, Everton are a lot more confident as well. So, Jewsfrey Hall places the ball down. Burton, Albion, nil, Lincoln City won. Burton, Albion without a winning four. Gary Bowie's side as Jewsfrey Hall waits on this near side, the left. Everton, Rawl, Blue shirts playing from right to left. Clips it in. Martínez is struggling. He actually fell backwards there. Tarkovsky, referee has given a free kick once again. So, let's get into that goal at Stoke. Pat Murphy. Goals come from the centre-back, Bowes and Lowell are high, stooping header from a corner. Olsopp, who just made a magnificent save from Mubamba, couldn't quite get it. They deserve it, Stoke. They're playing brilliantly. Stoke won, Birmingham, nil. And that second goal from Bristol City with Betty Glover. Emile Rees for this third of the season. Lovely ball from Emetti across the face of goal. Emile Rees was there. He was timed his run perfectly, tapped it in. Emetti down the left is so threatening, Wednesday can't contain him. Sheppard Wednesday, nil, Bristol City 2. Thank you, Betty. Here is Cash. Rogers can't control it. Will run through to Michael Keane, tied his up all the way back to Jordan Pickford. Seven successive clean sheets he's kept whilst he's been the England goalkeeper. But he's out of his goal there. And as it fell to Bwendia, Bwendia with the vision knew exactly what he wanted to do. And he must have been about six, seven yards forward of the centre-circle. And he's going to hit it first time right-footed, but it was off target. Yeah, well, Jordan Pickford himself, Pickford found himself almost in the left-back position. And as it dropped to Bwendia, he was miles out of his area. Just couldn't get the right purchase on the ball. He tried to drill it hard and low. It was a big opportunity. There's been a goal at Ibrox. You'll know which way it's gone when you hear the noise behind Gavin Wallace. And what noise would that be, Deno? It is Rangers nil, hearts one. Lawrence Shanklin. Claudio Braga picks it up inside. The Rangers half-darts forward. Shanklin overlaps, goes far side of Butland. It is Rangers nil, hearts one. Certainly not having an easy time of it, Russell Martin. So they are behind again. They've fallen behind a few times already in the early stages up in Scotland. Nil nil it remains here. We're in the 25th minute of this contest. We've got the St. Ledger coming up in probably about 15 minutes time. We're crossing to Doncaster and John Hunt. No other goals elsewhere around the country to tell you about. As Aston Villa with Telemans plays the ball to Cash. Really looks to close him down. Jusbri Hall, Everton working hard off the ball. Even Beto's back there as well. Telemans tries to wriggle clear to Rogers to McGinn on the overlap. Cash, first hand cross. Text of deflection, he's able to clear. It's a late flag. Offside, free kick to Everton. Nil nil. Yeah, best moment of the game for Aston Villa. Quick move in the ball. One and two touch. Shifted Everton's midfield press. Finally, a lot better from them. Just the run was a little bit too early for Matty Cash to go in behind, but it was a great opportunity. Let's get an update from West Brom with Charlie Slater. 24 minutes gone. All West Brom all the time, though it is goalless. Their best chance from a Jed Wallace cross. It found Isaac Price on the volley. 18 yards out straight at the goalkeeper. Nil nil. Just been checking my notes from the old firm a few weeks ago. Rangers going into that game with their worst start in 42 years. And they are behind to Hartz then at Ibrox, nor the goals elsewhere to tell you about ironic cheers from the Everton supporters. Normally when you get a new stadium, it takes a while for the atmosphere to take hold, doesn't it? I wouldn't say that's the case here. No, it hasn't at all. I think that was one of the things. I think sometimes you wonder where fans will position themselves. There used to be in certain areas within Goodison. And will you get those same people around you that create that atmosphere? There's been no problem at all with that. I just wonder as well whether the safe standing as well helps behind the goal to our right-hand side and the south stand. It certainly seems to be adding a little bit more to the stadium. The voice of Stephen Warnock on BBC Radio 5 Live with the World Service, Nil nil. Fleetwood won Walsall won. So Walsall have gone an equaliser. Chesterfield, Nil, NK Donnes won is the latest score also in League 2. Is it me or is Simon Hooper starting getting whistle happy? Yeah, he has a little bit, but I do think that was the right decision there. He tried to let the game go on a little bit before, but it was one of those incidents where he just clipped. It was better when on Bogart where he just clipped his ankles, brought him to the ground. Everton fans, they don't like it, but it had it being the other way. They would have been furious as well. Back to Newcastle and Mike. Well, Jürson Mosquera has just had a lengthy treatment inside the Walsal penalty area. I think he took a shot from Newcastle's new signing, Nick Volta Marder at full pelt, but he's off the pitch. He'll come back on shortly. Newcastle, Nil. Walsal, 27 minutes play. That commentary is on sports extra. Not for the first time, Aston Villa are trying to play out from the back and are almost getting themselves in a right old mess. Temi Martinez, arguably the most experienced player on the pitch, and he's the one playing short passes into his midfield. And think of all the people that wouldn't want people to receive a ball deep in the penalty area, is one of his own players, and he's just put his team in so much danger. Yeah. Pickford strikes it first time, left footed, and Jai tries to get underneath it. Downward header from Konso. Jewsbury Hall, leaping into that challenge. Cleared then by Matty Cash. Tarkovsky with a high right leg, steps forward, and then Iroboonam's ball out towards O'Brien was just too far ahead of the Everton right back, and it was delivered with pace, and it was actually arcing away from him. And so it went out for an Aston Villa throw on that far side, as weak autumnal sunshine here on Merseyside, 0-0. Yeah, I think he just got caught up with the momentum of the way the game was going then, and the crowd was picking up as Tarkovsky stepped in, and he just needed to compose himself a little bit. But again, Everton, the press in so high, Aston Villa found, and it's so difficult to get any foothold in the game. Now they're trying to slow it down to the speed that we know they like to slow it down to, but the press again from Everton is really positive. Shrewsbury Town, Nils Salford City, 1 is the latest scoring league too. Aston Villa go back, Consa in the shadows of the main stand here, and then Telemans just outside the centre-circle back to Consa, short diagonal ball. Telemans, the Belgian international towards Bwendier, tries to get away with a 2-10, and Gij... I know we're quite high up in a long way, I thought, and Gij with a right foot got the ball to prod it away from Bwendier. Bwendier goes to the ground, and Simon Hooper says it's a free kick. I'll say I thought it was a free kick. I thought Bwendier just nudged it away from Elemen and Gij, did enough just to take it away from him, and that foot that you're talking about from Nij, just sweep the legs of Bwendier. As free kick for Aston Villa, nil nil, Telemans stands over it. They place the ball out towards the far side, Dynia left-hand side, Dynia closed down by Nij, and loses the ball. There's a goal at Newcastle, Mike Minay. £69 million well spent, Nick Volta-Marder scores on his Newcastle debut, a way to the left-hand side, cross-gaming for the right, big header, as you'd expect from the tall striker, and into the left-hand side of the goal, Newcastle 1, Wolves nil. Alexander who? Volta-Marder. They'll certainly be welcome his first goal, and for Isaac, who's not guaranteed necessarily to start that game tomorrow at Burnley, two o'clock kick-off. Certainly Arna Slott was saying that they're going to have to measure his minutes in the early stages. It's not about the next two weeks, it's about the next six years. Comments with that incidentally, Turf Moore will be on five live before the Manchester Dali City United at 4.30. Bristol Rovers 2, Barrow nil. He's becoming disjointed with the referee's decisions. John Bennett watching Crystal Palace Sunderland. It's nil nil, but Yerimipino so close to a perfect home debut for Crystal Palace, his shot just wide, he's just been clattered as well by Ray Nildo, but luckily he's okay after a long stoppage. Crystal Palace nil, Sunderland nil. Grealish just trying to get away from Cash, tight behind him, holding his shirt, clearly pulling the back of that raw blue shirt was the Polish international, Matty Cash. And Irribunam will win a throw for Everton off the legs of Morgan Rodgers, the PFA Young Player of the Year, Harrogate Towner leading at Swindon by Goulton Il Swindon, who won four successive matches in League Two. They were second this morning, Simon Weaver-Side have taken the lead in the Premier League earlier, Arsenal went to the top of the table after that 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, Bournemouthly, Brighton and Hobalbian by Goulton Il, Newcastle are winding up at home to Wolves, Garner with a throw on this near side, and it's flicked on, Keane is there and then it's caught by Martinez. He might have just got one either on the hand or in the ribs there from Keane, I think it actually came off a villa head. Yeah, I think it did, I mean Beto won the first initial flick on and then credit to Emi Martinez, he was the one who was alive to the situation, the ball just lost its momentum but there are danger from long throws, Everton. Here is Anjai running with the ball on his feet making inroads as well, Keane is in support, Keane helps it on its way, here is Grealish, Grealish in towards the penalty area, can he get a decisive goal, he goes that wide and he fires it left footed in low, but it comes off the shins of concert and behind for an Everton corner kick, Niel Niel. Yeah, he's petrified, Batty Cash in a 1v1 situation, he just knew he couldn't dive in on Jack Grealish, Jack Grealish held all the cards in that situation, gets to the byline, tries to get the cross back but good for positional sense from Esri Konza. Grimsby Town, Niel Cambridge United, 1 is the latest score in League 2, as Jusbree Hall on this near side, the Everton left, still goalless here with a corner kick, in it goes now, just over the top, Batty was gone and wasn't it, he was clipped in right footed and it was a teasing ball into that six yard area. Yeah, Michael Keane with the flick has had a great opportunity there to win that header, he comes from behind, Emi Martinez initially makes the run in front of him, then gets in front of Tyrone Mings, a little flick towards the near post, just a little bit too much on it, only needed to glance it, got too much contact, another opportunity for Everton. Dundee Niel Motherwell 1 is the latest score on the Scottish Premiership at Dent's Park, Martinez is able to pick his pass from that goal kick, out to Deenia Falside the left, infield now to Tealum and he gives it away, straight towards Jusbree Hall, forward ball towards Beto on the stretch, couldn't gather it in, cleared away by the Aston Villa defence, only as far as Ghana, here is Keane, back out towards Ghana, down the left hand side, that was late by Cash, catching Greenish, going to get a yellow card, first booking of the game, Matty Cash books, Everton freekid. Yeah, silly from Matty Cash, absolutely brilliant from Jack Greenish, knew exactly what he wanted to do, he just accelerated towards the ball right at the last second, Matty Cash thought he could win the ball, just pinches it round the corner, Cash leaves the 14, now he's booked, now he's in trouble, because every time that the ball goes out into that left hand side, isolate Jack Greenish against Matty Cash, we might see a little bit of a positional change here, because I think Bogart might end up at right back, and Matty Cash might end up at right wing, took McGinnin alongside Tealamans and inside, because getting the run around in the field, Aston Villa. He actually used to play, didn't he, on the wing for Nottingham Forrest, before he was converted into a fallback, as now in the 34th minute of the game here at the Hildickinson Stadium, the Everton supporters rise to their feet in memory of Paul Marion, who sadly has passed away a day after the Brydon Hove-Alvian game at the age of 34, and his picture actually comes on the giant screens at either end of the stadium, and a pause in his memory, and even the Aston Villa supporters are also joining in, nice touch. Yeah, lovely talk, Jeff, sorry it's on a lot of people's social medias, friends that I know who are close with Paul, so very sad day. Well, a lovely gesture by Everton and the Aston Villa fans. Tramir Overs won, Newport County 0 and the championship, Wrexham 0, Queens Park Rangers 1, and in League 1 our featured game, as Aston Villa attacking, Tarkovsky stretches, gets there before Buendia, but he wins it back towards Rodgers, shot comes in, takes the deflection, penalty at stop point, Adam Cotier. Oliver Norwood is lining it up for Stockport here in a push in the penalty area on Oden Bailey, and Cardiff who've only conceded one goal so far this season in League 1, about to face this penalty, Stockport twice close already, and Norwood will step up here with the goalkeeper waiting on his line, and he scores 1-0 to Stockport. So, Stockport County leading Cardiff City who were knocked off their perch at the top of League 1 by Bradford City who beat Huddersfield by 3 goals to 1, the first League meeting between the two in 18 years, and Bradford's impressive start to the season continues. Northampton beat Blackpool by a goal to nil in the early game in League 1, and the early fixtures in League 2, Ackrington got their first win of the season, 1-0 winners against Colchester, Crawley 2, Cheltenham nil, and the three results in the championship, Chelten 1, Millwall 1, Oxford 2, Leicester 2, Preston 2, Middlesbrough 2. Let's get the betting then for the St. Laidge, John Hunt. And very tight indeed at the top of the market Ian, between Scandinavia and Lamborn, Scandinavia just favourites in around 5-2, Carmas is a 4-1 chance, it's a big threat to the Mall I reckon, stay true 8-1, and Raheeb 14-1 with Tarrians and further both 20-1, but as they arrive at the post in the Doncaster sunshine, Scandinavia just favoured ahead of Lamborn and Carmas. Thank you John, we'll be with you very, very soon, Reading of equalised at Oakwell in League 1, Barnsley 1, Reading 1, no other goals to tell you, oh in fact a part of another one at Hillsborough for Betty Glover. And it's gone Bristol City's way once again, Wednesday just had a good spell of pressure but Bristol City on the counter have another Mametti again, some terrible defending, Wednesday couldn't clear it, Mametti slaughtered it home, Sheppard Wednesday nil, Bristol City 3. So coverage of the St. Ledger is two or three minutes away, this is BBC Radio 5 live and the World Service in the sunshine now down by the Docks where it is Everton nil, Aston Villa nil, in Beto putting Ming's under pressure, Ming's goes down the line, interception though from Anjai before Dina, hemmed in towards the corner flag in front of the Aston Villa, supporters is Anjai tries to roll away from his man and then they've actually doubled up on him and Bwendiah's intervention was crucial for Villa but still they can't get out of their own box, Bwendiah keeps the ball in play, Rodgers comes back to help out, he heads it now towards Bogard but Everton oppressing, gay, ratting around in the midfield, there's a foul in there and it'll be Anaston Villa free kick midway through the road half, Everton works so hard off the ball. Yeah they do and that's that athleticism that I talked about before now they can get around the pitch and it's something that will take time to see more consistently from Everton but here comes Aston Villa. Watkins to McGinn, he tees up Tealemans, no whip on that left hand side, he went to pass it that way instead they go towards the right, cash with the cross, blocked by a sliding Ghana, he started the season in superb fashion as James Ghana whether it be at left back or in midfield. Here now is Tealemans, Dina has made the run and Tealemans has spotted him, oh and then Brian Dutton underneath it and I think Dina would actually stop going after the ball. It's the gamble you take as a fullback and you think are they going to gamble on you winning the first head-driver and maybe see where the ball's going to drop because you're back pedaling you're not really going to get much distance on the header and that's exactly what Luca Dina did. Bit of a gamble from Jacob O'Brien but it paid off this time. How is the mood at Eyebrocks Gavin Wallace? It's changed a little bit because Steyl O'Askard has just smacked one off the cross but albeit they go to the German goalkeeper just touched it on, still one nil to Hearts at the moment but Rangers coming back into it then. He got a hat trick didn't he in midweek in that thumping of Moldova for Norway, couldn't quite match the haul of Erling Harland as Gay wins the challenge that 50-50 in the midfield, Wimbledon nil, Rotherham 1 is the latest scorer in league 1 and Jai slows it down and then looks to accelerate then goes on the outside of Dina and he's left Dina for dad and Jai now sends over the cross from the right hand side collected by Grealish, left hand side of the penalty area six yards up Grealish shoots, blocks, spins out to the edge of the area, stabbed forward by Rogers, laid off by Watkins, Bogard now in towards McGinn, Rogers and Watkins going on ahead of him, instead it's a floated ball played very well by McGinn and he looked for Brundia and now Dina is joining the attack and here is the former Everton defender in field towards Telemans back towards Brundia they're now in the penalty area Aston Villa and the cross is gathered in by Pickford, Chancellor Bournemouth to Hellside. Still Bournemouth 1, Brighton nil, five minutes to play in the first half Ian but a chance for Brighton and Jan Kubenminter racing down the right hand side he fired in the shot towards the near post it was neatly turned away by the Bournemouth goalkeeper Petrovic, Bournemouth 1, Brighton nil. Bit more even now isn't it? Yeah they're coming back into it Aston Villa it's just getting a little bit more of a basketball game if you like bit end to end but the one thing I'd say Dano I would pay money to watch Ilumine and Jai he's a superb footballer you think of the money they pay for him it's around about £15 million wasn't it from Marseille in today's money that is an incredible bit of business. Yeah it was a five-year deal too but he is a joy to watch since Aston Villa got promoted back to the top flight in 2019 they're actually unbeaten in 12 league meetings against Everton they've won nine they've drawn three so in that sense they might be the perfect opposition to get their first goal of the season as Rodgers will win a corner off the legs of King King was just drawn out of defense Aston Villa corner kick on this near side the right four minutes to go to the break. Yeah they have to be so careful Everton because what we do know about Aston Villa is in forward areas Olly Watkins Morgan Rodgers Buendia they are they've got creative players and they've got players that can just turn the game on its head in a moment and that's whatever it's in a fearful of. We've got a quick goal update from Owen Gwyneth at Swansea. Yeah it's been a bit of a footballing game so far but Swansea ahead Swansea one hell 15-0 the ball being worked into the box and on the turn Bipotnik turning smashing an head his fourth goal this season Swansea one hell 0. All without an away win since April the fifth Swansea are unbeaten at home so far this season Peter Brattu Wicom 0. Peter Brattu then have got a second goal as they look for their first win of the season Aston Villa taking the time with the corner kick we're going racing for the St. Ledger very very soon. On this near side the right Pickford under pressure from Deenu's left-footed ball in swinging corner gets away and deals with it well under pressure three minutes to go to halftime Everton 0 Aston Villanil Martinez plays a flatball through straight through to his opposite number Jordan Pickford. I just never understand that you've got an outfield player in front of you who's five yards away and you think you can ping a better ball as a goalkeeper that's why you're a goalkeeper because you don't have the ability to hit the same passes that's someone that just baffles me. We're going racing it's the St. Ledger John Hunt. The runners seven of them about to turn into the straight here at Doncaster with Lamborn the Derby winner leading the field ahead of the favourite Scandinavia the two of them are stablemates they're one and two at the moment third place for Carmas Carmas only been beaten once in his career he's travelling strongly in third Aiden O'Brien's third string stay true is in fourth place then comes further further followed by his stablemate Tarrians and Rahab is right at the back end of the field they come down the Doncaster home straight the St. Ledger the last of the five British racing classics Lamborn the Derby winner being having some pressure applied to him now by both Scandinavia and Carmas is now committing down the outside and Carmas nosing alongside Lamborn Scandinavia between the two of them then comes stay true great battle here it's been unrelenting the pace and Scandinavia now just forges on Scandinavia with stay true down the outside Lamborn at the moment it's an Aiden O'Brien one two three Carmas is in fourth place Rahab is staying on in taking fashion now switch to the far side running rail Scandinavia is in front though Lamborn the Derby winner is now beaten Scandinavia stay true Rahab is still staying on strongly over on the far side running rail he's going to be the danger to Scandinavia Scandinavia and Rahab Scandinavia just does enough to win it from Rahab in second place stay true came next and Lamborn ultimately was well beaten so too was Carmas by about a head or maybe a neck Scandinavia has given Aiden O'Brien a ninth St. Ledger victory in the hands of Tom Marcon Tom riding because Ryan Moore broke his leg a week or two ago and that's a second St. Ledger win for Tom Marcon and Ian I know you like some facts and figures but that is a hat trick of wins for Aiden O'Brien now in the St. Ledger and that is the first time that that has happened by a trainer for 185 years wow what an impressive statistic that is John thank you very much not missed anything whilst we've been away in terms of action it remains Everton Nill Aston Villanille Swindon though have got an equaliser at home to Harrogate Town Swindon won Harrogate one and Queensport Rangers have got a second goal at Wrexham Wrexham still without a home win in the championship this season have fallen 2-0 behind there to QPR there's been a disallowed goal but to who to Mike Miner Newcastle Newcastle thought they'd had a second with Jacob Murphy composed finished but in the build at the man who teed him up Harvey Barnes three down the left hand side it was him who went a little too early so it's still Newcastle one-walls Nill DBC Radio 5 Live and the World Service we're going to find out how much additional time we will have here and as the fourth official hoists up that electronic board it will be two minutes other than that I've offended my producer Gary Flint off as Aston Villanille will get a direct free kick fractionally left of centre but certainly within shooting distance yeah it certainly is it's a dangerous position and one thing you'll know is is Luca D'Agnul edges way across it's Morgan Rogers who has the ball in his hand I can't believe you questioned Gary when it was the loudest tannoy announcements ever of two minutes I've had it extra time you what sorry you're just looking forward to your doughnut at half time aren't you I've heard a rumor that you're after another toffee doughnut you've had one I wouldn't be paying £6.50 for another one but if you can grab it if you can grab a freebie then I'll gladly take that X and a nil Port Vale too there's a free kick to Aston Villa which is 25 yards out shading probably more than that out from goal Aston Villa playing from left to right you've got Dina the referee's just backed into Luca D'Agnul almost stood on these toes Morgan Rogers is there you've got to be careful doing that if you remember Bruno that knocked him out of sink and moaned and blamed everyone for his poor penalty didn't he it certainly did why are you giggling that I'm just giggling have just um it's what whole city of equalize we'll get used to that goal in a moment let's just watch at this free kick when D'Agnul or Dina it is D'Agnul into the wall so Ohan Gwyneth at Swansea Swansea one hell city one against it under play slightly former Swansea hero only McBurney where the equalizer ball played in from the left hand side he slides in the six yard box to poke it in and McBurney strike gets up doesn't celebrate but it says Swansea one hell city one Aston Villa with a throw far side the left in towards mings at the near post and the referee's blown his whistle and that will be a free kick to no I think it's a foul throw you know no yeah I think he's saying he stepped onto the pitch yeah and he's picked up a lot of minor things but obviously if it's a foul throw it's a foul throw that's the second foul throw from Aston Villa in this half both from the full box as well nothing wrong with full backs having a pop I know no Stephen Warner 101 appearances and three goals during your time at Aston Villa yeah not prolific for my England international two is the halftime whistle sounds how would you sum up that first half I thought it was brilliant at the start from Everton the first 20 minutes I thought there was just a wave of attack from Everton the pressure that they were putting on Aston Villa to try and find or to make sure that they couldn't play up from the back but credit to Aston Villa they stayed within the game they've managed to get themselves back into it created a couple of opportunities nothing of real no but they've sort of made Everton step back a little bit and that's what you've got to do you've got to stay in the game when you're away from home but things can only get better from Aston Villa's point of view but David Moyes will be very pleased with what he's seen so halftime then here at the Hill Dickinson Stadium it is Everton nil Aston Villa nil halftime at Craven Cottage as well and it's the same scoreline Aaron Paul full of nil leads nil this has been a proper snoozefest smart leads with the only chances in a sloppy first half Cavalume with the head of straight into the arms of Leno long star smashing the crossbar with an effort from the edge of the D I'm not one for inane stats but a next year of zero and 0.2 for tells us now nil nil still playing at cellhurst park and it's goalless there this afternoon John Bennett yeah palace nil Sunderland nil but Sunderland more than holding their own against the team unbeaten here at cellhurst park since February Talby with a decent chance at the back post charge down palace nil Sunderland nil no doubt what the story is or who the story is that said James is part this afternoon might mine a yeah how quickly they forgot an alexander e-zack Nick Volta Marder the 69 million pound signing from Stuttgart a score on his debut ahead of from Jacob Murphy's cross here is Murphy again now on the edge of the D with a low shot this block T'Nally will pick up the loose range and hits the post as new castle look for that second goal they've already had one ruled out from VAR now T'Nally's hit the base at the right post rolled along the byline and it's still new castle one walls nil. Dean Husson has been sent off for Real Madrid this afternoon in La Liga after just half an hour for a professional foul his former teammates are having a better afternoon though so hell saahi. Yeah they're not missing in mark half time here Bournemouth one Brighton nil good value for their lead two former Bristol City players combining Semenyo he picked out Alex Scott just outside the penalty area he controlled and turned in one beautiful movement and fired in a low shot which for Bruggan was never stopping in the Brighton goal Semenyo is a constant threat for Bournemouth while two unwanted first half substitutions they've added to Brighton losing their rhythm half time here Bournemouth one Brighton nil back to Sal Hearst John it's half time Palace nil Sunderland nil Sunderland I think we'll be happy with that first half performance but Crystal Palace will feel they should be leading Yerimi Pino played through brilliantly by Dachie Kamada in space the goal at his mercy he put his shot wide he also put a long range effort just the wrong side of the post as well but Sunderland looking like the team with confidence after two wins in three already this season Palace nil Sunderland nil Plymouth have lost all three of their away games in the league this season but they've retaken the lead at Luton on the stroke of half time Bradley Ibrahim with the goal for Tom Cleverly's side let's go into the championship Stoke Birmingham half time Pat Murphy Stoke lead one nil good value their wingers have enjoyed themselves the approach has been fast and aggressive Laval got the only goal a looping header from a corner 15 yards out it could have been more Stoke one Birmingham nil back to the Premier League half time whistle has gone to St James's my my name yeah big dick energy is how Newcastle's ex has praised their new striker it's the 60 million pound man Nick Volta Mardu who's had a has Newcastle won the Luton cross that Alan Shearer has described as water cross on Twitter this afternoon came from Jacob Murphy who's been brilliant in and around the 18-yard box creating and taking opportunities even had a goal ruled out himself with Harvey Barnes offside in the buildup as for Wolves may be bottom but they don't necessarily look it up to the goal they had been in the game they had asked questions through Wang and Rodrigo Gromez plus new signing uh creaching it means at half time though plays Adam Matoan at Newcastle one Wolves nil half time whistle has gone in all four three o'clock in the Scottish Premiership goal was at Ptodgery between Aberdeen and Livingston Motherwell are a goal up at Dundee at Folkirk nil St Mirren nil and listen to this from Ibrox Gavin Rangers nil heart of Midlothian one Lauren Shanklin on 22 his fifth goal of the season Claudia Braga broke three he pushed through Lauren Shanklin on the overlap he just slipped him in and he went the far side of Jack Butlin Rangers have really had nothing at all apart from maybe a good shot from Thilo Asgard maybe 10 minutes before half time it was tipped on to the bar poor from Rangers hearts well in control it is Rangers nil hearts won let's go back to the Championship where it's goalless at the Hawthorns at the break Charlie one way traffic for the home side though Price has twice gone close Mepper Masin ahead of Flash across the face of it Derby haven't even thought of threatening the other net they will be thrilled that it's still goalless all square there all square at Swansea as well Alain Gwinneth yeah Swansea City one Hell City one only McBurney's equaliser late in the half uh four Holy Plainters and the Potnick's fourth goal of the season on the whole it's been a game lacking in in quality and accuracy but Swansea will feel they had a better of things but at least those two goals I've given the fans something to talk about Swansea one a whole one elsewhere in this championship this afternoon Norwich lead at Coventry by a goal to nil Sheffield Wednesday nil Bristol City three Hillsborough Bristol City unbeaten the championship this season Sheffield Wednesday continuing their miserable start goalless between Watford and Blackburn and at Wrexham at the break it is Wrexham nil QPR two a Conocoadie own goal and Richard Coney has got his third of the season for QPR let's get details of that game at Coventry Mark Webber where it's half time Coventry nil Norwich one Norwich one picked Coventry's defense better than the Artful Dodger on the counter attack and have silenced the home crowd with a lead at half time Mateus Fiskarden 17 minutes in loose mark on a counter attack to drive a shot into the Coventry goal before that Coventry were peppering the Norwich goal picker the chances for Efron Mason-Krack in the first 20 minutes requiring two Super saves from the keeper Coventry nil Norwich one let's go into lead one we're at Stockport Cardiff this afternoon Adam Cotier an uncomfortable afternoon so far for the morning leaders Cardiff Mark Stockport one Cardiff nil Ollie Norwich penalty after Perrion G had pushed over Benoni and Dresen and Dresen has hit the post Kyle Wattner's produced a fine save from

Castell into league two we're with the league just gilling them this afternoon not counting their visitors Mike Williams goalless at the break but this has been a real snooze-fest in Kent no talking

beat Lancashire earlier in the second semi-final Melissa story well Northampton a bit of trouble there 65 for 5 after 8 overs they dismissed the dangerous Northampton captain David Willie his first ball the centurion in the quarter final for Northampton Ravi Bopare he went just for 8 and safe save just now dismissed by a fantastic catch by Allio diving on the boundary to his left bit of a rebuild needed now for Northampton 69 for 5 Russell four in Poland at the tennis world number 484 Olaf Pieczkovski pushed Cameron Norrie very hard in the first set but Norrie has won it 6-4 and the 21 year old is feeling the pace he was given a time violation when he wasn't remotely ready to serve after one brutal rally and so despite losing the doubles earlier in this Davis Cup tie GB lead 2-1 and are a set away from winning the tie against Poland it's going with serving the second set 2-1 Poland in rugby union in the rugby championship earlier South Africa thrashed New Zealand in New Zealand by 43 points to 10 Argentina won in Australia as well by 28 points to 26 in the women's world cup New Zealand earlier beat South Africa by 46 points to 17 and they're about to get underway between Canada and Australia Maz yeah and both sides making a couple of changes for the business end of this tournament mark Canada three from the Scotland win which saw them progress from Paul B as the group winners Australia making two from their defeat to England last weekend looking to make the semi-finals of a world cup for the first time in 15 years the Waller is but we expect them to find it pretty tough against the Canada side ranked second in the world the winners will play New Zealand here in the last four on Friday we get underway in the next two minutes or so couple of minutes to four o'clock Al Tanzli has the news the voice of the UK this is BBC Radio 5 Live the Metropolitan police has estimated that 110,000 people have attended a rally in London organised by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson the force estimated the number at a counter-decent counter demonstration organised by stand-up to racism was around 5,000 Downing Street has pushed back against criticism of

alert as it can't rule out another strike the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Israel tomorrow. Let's go to Wemworth we're on the third round Victor Hovland leads Ian yes he does but he had to birdie the 10th to get back up the top of the leaderboard after drop shots at eight and nine opened up with three birdies in his first four holes so he's at 13 under par as he plays the 11th one ahead of the Frenchman Adrian Sadié who has only had one bogey on a very changeable weather wise day here at Wemworth 12 under par and Alex Noran the winner of the British Masters former champion here he's at 12 under but a really good day mark for Tyrell Hatton he is bogey free today six under par for his round 11 under just two behind and John Hunk can tell us he's had a really good day at the St Ledger yeah that's that man it's a familiar headline mark Aiden O'Brien with his ninth winning the St Ledger favorite Scandinavia winning by a neck there from Rahib but Aiden O'Brien making new records all the time as his career develops John Scott 185 years ago was the last trainer to win a hat trick of St Ledgers until today Aiden O'Brien has just matched him with that achievement the Derby winner and certainly Mark Lamborn faded to fourth he was a little bit under par thank you John Martins he commended got his first goals for the club two of them and Victor Ioccares the other has also beat Nottingham forest 3-0 Eberich Eze and Nonny Madwecki started on the wings and Mikhail Artheta was impressed by them both of them I think they were terrific a real threat with their own qualities so different in the way that they create danger threat and unpredictability to the opponent but very pleased it will require different profiles around them as well to maximize the qualities as they have but they are both in in a good moment your players all over the pitch you sparkle for you and the man with two goals the first one was a thunderbolt the second one was a header from Zuber Mendy incredible nothing to be the way he's performing the authority is showing on the pitch great if he's adding goals on top of that and the type of goal that he scored today then yeah what else can we ask and at the back you were without Saliba but it was seamless there was you wouldn't you wouldn't have noticed he wasn't there yeah I think Mosque again I think we have to throw him at Anfield after five minutes or three minutes I don't know when he was and he had an unbelievable performance and today again it was really solid very convinced again very connected with the defensive line very impressive so good all around at this moment in time everything looking strong for you it is we had the injury of Martin that we don't really know where what happens it looks like the same area of the previous injury so the rest good obviously we lost willow we have still a few plays obviously and feet and they are not available for selection but overall okay. Micaela Teta with Jonathan Pears the thoughts of Ange Poster Coggely during sports report at final clock about five o'clock before full commentary from the London Stadium of West Ham against Tottenham back and away as you can hear at Everton Ian Dennis yes just back and away so perfect timing it is nil nil between Everton and Aston Villa but I can tell you that Aston Villa have made a change at half time Euryd Telemans has gone off and Evan Gessin has come on the Ivory Coast international for just his third appearance as Everton playing from left to right as we look within Jai lays it off towards O'Brien they have picked for the goal O'Brien Keen Tarkovsky Garner at left back Gay Eribunam, Jusbree Hall and Jai Grealish and Beto for Everton in their royal blue shirts and white shorts so they are attacking that giant stand away towards our right that holds the 13,000 all the way back trying to mirror what they've done at Dortmund of course with the yellow wall and very similar as well to those who've been at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium too in comes the throw from O'Brien it was a long one in towards the penalty area and just looking to see how Aston Villa have jigged things around Gessin is playing on the right isn't he? Yeah and then McGinn's gone alongside Bogard in midfield so it's not much of a huge change for them, point here out on this left hand side but what it will do now is I think they'll just be looking to push James Garner back into that left back position with Gessin and his ability to take people on in 1v1 situations but we have seen him predominantly off the left hand side when he started and played for Aston Villa so far. So that's how the midfield is configured with Rodgers in behind Watkins and then the defence is Cash, Mings, Konsa and Dina. Emi Martinez is in goal but Everton are coming forward and this is gay. Can't switch it with to Grealish, struck the heels of McGinn, picked back up though by Everton, Jewsbury Hall falls over, over running the midfield and Rodgers now looks for Watkins easily cut out though by Tarkovsky. Hardly had to really break Stride there to step forward. O'Brien now runs forward with the ball, the right back playing from left to right as well, Irregulant, former Villa player, Jewsbury have equalised at home to Salford City in League 2, Jewsbury 1, Salford City 1, out to Grealish, hugging that left touch line comes infield, they're doled up on him, flicks it back, shot from Garner, Beto, stays it wide. It was a low ball fist in, Beto tried to guide it in right footed and it was probably about a foot or so wide of the right hand post, it remains 0-0, trying the women's rugby union World Cup. Canada, Australia, Masferuki. Yeah, pretty much from kickoff, good link up play down the left from Canada and then a burst of speed from Asia, Hogan, Rochester touching down on the corner. The conversion was missed by Sophie de Goody but Canada starting this match as they mean to go on in this rugby World Cup quarter final, Canada 5, Australia 0. Thanks, Mas, you'll get that on Sports Extra 2, it's a streaming service available through the BBC Sounds app, as we mentioned in the first half, more choice than ever before through the BBC Sounds app, Watford-Neal Blackbird Rovers 1 is the latest score in the championship and Everton, starting the second half as they started the first but are still looking to try and break the deadlock here. On that left hand side, Garner tries to thread it through towards Jewsbury Hall, comes back to Irribunam, ball inside is towards Gay, six yards forward of the centre circle, now it's with Anjai, challenged and dispossessed, breaks up towards Watkins. Watkins has got to go it alone, we've hardly mentioned the England striker but as he looked for a ball there from Rodgers, it was easily dealt with by Keane. Yeah, he's been poor today, Morgan Rodgers, such an important player for Aston Miller and shine for England as well on the international break but he struggled. Grealish hasn't, Grealish coming forward, links up with Jewsbury Hall and then in many ways they were probably guilty of overplaying Everton, the ball then was just chipped back in by Grealish and he thinking have a shot at goal, goes out for a goal kick. Yeah, it was absolutely perfect as he came in off that left hand side, Jack Grealish, he fed it into Jewsbury Hall, little layoff and he should have struck it with the laces or tried to bend it into the far corner, great opportunity for Jack Grealish but I've got to go back to the Beto incident before, Deno, he should score, he should have scored two today, Beto, that's the issue that he has in front of goal, he just doesn't have that quality, the runs in behind, the work rate, you cannot fault him for, just that composure in front of goal has to be better. Yeah, his record is 17 goals in 75 appearances before today, 10 goals last season but it could easily have added and made it three in three and he'd taken a couple of chances so far here today, meanwhile, Buendir runs forward at the heart of the Everton defence shoot, it's actually a reflection and looks why that could have gone anywhere, instead it's gone behind for a corner kick, there's been a goal at Bournemouth, Sahel Sahi. Equaliser, it's Bournemouth one, Brighton one, very simple, minter with a cross from the right hand side and Metoma with a free header at the far post, it's being checked but it's still at this moment, Bournemouth one, Brighton one. Thank you Sahel, Dundir equalised at home to Motherwell in the Scottish Premier Wigan three, Don Castor-Roberts, Neil, you're up today, you can hear the Villas supporters bathing in the sunshine in that bottom quadrant on that far left corner, five minutes played in the second half, so Cash has come across to this near side, this will be an in-swinger, a number of Everton supporters in this steep main stand, still making their way back to their seats after the halftime hospitality, Cash to take it in towards the near post, flicked on towards the far post and then volleyed away to safety by O'Brien, Jillingham lead, Knotts County by a goal to Neil, that's Jillingham who are still unbeaten, leading Knotts County with second place swindon, the last we heard trailing against Harrogate they could extend their lead at the top of the table, we're bringing news of that goal, meanwhile in the meantime we're going to sell her as Park and John Bennett. Crystal Palace, Neil Sunderland, Neil the game is opening up, double chance for Palaeus, it was Mateta who forced to save and then following up, Pino shot was deflected over, Crystal Palace, Neil Sunderland, Neil. Everton, Neil Aston Villa, Neil Aston Villa on this near side the left, Deena and he is going to go back as we will get news of that goal at Priestfield, Mike Williams. Jillingham won, Knotts County, Neil the lead two leaders taking just 50 seconds in this second half to head themselves in front, lovely cushion header from the Jillingham number nine, Josh Andrews making it Jillingham one, Knotts County, Neil. Wiccan Wancers have got a goal back at London road, Peter Brattu Wiccan one is in league one and also in league one Wimbledon one rather a united one, Aston Villa are attacking, Rogers 30 yards out from goal, out to Deena on the left hand side, this near side and it comes, Keen with a flying header, Jusbree Hall almost gives it away to get that inside his own penalty area and in the end it was clear but that was a slight bit of concern for Everton in that back line. Yeah it was brilliant play from Aston Villa, they got forced back towards their own penalty area, the ball ended up back in Martyn as his feet but just three passes later and they're in a penalty area of Everton such as the free-flowing move from Aston Villa starting to just find the rhythm Aston Villa here. Only the second time in the club's history that they have failed to score in their first three league games, 97-98 was the last time, they did actually score in the fourth game but they lost 3-2 at White Heart Lane that day as they lost their opening four under Brian Little, 0-0 and still waiting to get their account up and running for this season, 0-0 it remains, Fulham Leeds United, Aaron Paul. 0-0 leads with another cracking opportunity, stack in towards Aronson who just deflected it towards Skog, really good save by Burnlena from close range, torrential downpour here at the cottage to the point in where you know we're sat in a stand which is 150 or so years old, we're actually losing all forms of replays and video assistance here, 0-0. We've got bright sunshine here on Merseyside, tell you what Stephen, that hospitality must be good, we are eight minutes into the second half and still the Everton supporters in front of us are coming back to their seats. You thinking about food and drink again? No, here is Rogers looking to turn into Watkins with his back to goal, lays it off towards Bwendir, Deanie provides the whip on this near side of the left and it requires Arkofsky to stretch inside his six yard area and stretch, he did behind it goes for a corner kick, 0-0. Yeah, you can hear the Aston Villa fans away to our far side, they're looking now like the better team, Aston Villa, they're the ones that are creating more opportunities, they're now getting Luka Deanie higher up the pitch, they're getting the wingers, wingers a little bit more narrow, they're causing the Everton defenders problems, it's been better from Aston Villa so far in the second half. Lutentown have got an equaliser at Kenilworth Road, Lutentown two, Plymouth Argyle two is the latest score in League One, so another corner kick for Aston Villa, and here the travelling support, as Cash waits, right armour loft, Clips it in now towards the near post, Mings was in there, Everton partially get the ball away, only as far as Deanie floats it forward with the outside of his left boot, and claimed by Jordan Pickford, crew lead Barnett by Goulton Hill in League Two, we'll get an update from St James' Park, Mike Minay. Newcastle One-Walls-Nil played six minutes to the second half, the home side dominant from the restart, a lot being played in the walls half, but no real test on Sam Johnston yet, Newcastle One-Walls-Nil. Commentary of that continues on Sports Extra, it might be two-two between Lutentown and Plymouth, but Joe Edwards has been sent off, so Plymouth are now down to 10 men, it remains goalless, 10 minutes into the second half, what have you made of these opening exchanges since the restart? Well I think the changing personnel has definitely helped Aston Villa, I think McGinn's looked better in that central area, I think he's helped dominate the game for Aston Villa so far, Leucadena's been able to get higher up on that left hand side, but the energy levels haven't quite been the same from Everton, Nacom Villa again down the left hand side. Bogard just didn't have the weight of the pass to reach, but he's getting forward at every opportunity on this near side, the throw is taken quickly to Wendier, Wendier does a little step over, passes the ball to Bogard and marked outside the area, he brings Cash into play, Cash on the edge of the box, pushes the ball out wide, Gessin now with a cross, gathered in by Pickford, so we will go to West Brom, Charlie Slater. Tang on in the second half, West Brom, Neil Darby, Neil, don't know how though, West Brom should be in front, Campbell's header was cleared off the line by his own team mate, Mowit just couldn't get out of the way, frantic start to the second half, Nil-Nil. Barnsley lead Reading by two goals to honour Oakwell in League One, the results earlier today, Arsenal going top of the table, beating Nunningham Forest 3-0, in the championship, Charlton 1-0, Woll-1, Oxford 2-0, Leicester City 2-0, Preston 2-0, Middlesbrough 2-0, in League One, Bradford City beat Huddersfield Town in the West York, Shadarby their first win over their rivals in 20 years, what a start that Graham Alexander's side have had in League One, Northampton beat Blackpool by a goal to Nil, in League Two, Ackerton their first win of the season, beating Colchester 1-0, Crawley 2-0, Cheltenham Nils, sports report at five, the results and the reaction before our next commentary, Westham Tottenham at 5.30. Look at Dynia, just picked up a yellow card there, both full backs now, Buck for Aston Villa, Lim and Jai just rolled him, was the way down that right hand side and Dynia had no other option, putchester pulled a shirt of Lim and Jai. Barnett have quickly equalised at Crue in League Two, so Crue One, Barnett one, Jusbry Hall then, good 15 yards inside the Aston Villa half on this near side the right in front of the box like technical areas here in this new stadium as Jusbry Hall, a little bit wayward, couldn't wrap his left foot around that and he went onto the head of McGinn, up it goes then Mings heads it straight towards Gae, ball through the Beto, first time shot, no, his next touch was a heavy one, it had been better off shooting first time because his second touch was more like a pass to the Aston Villa defence. Yeah, he should have hit it first time, it was perfect for him, or just fizzed across the the six yard box, tried to cut inside, terrible heavy touch, just lacking confidence completely at the moment, isn't he? The big man. He scored two in two, he actually was on target as well on international duty, in February he did score three in three but as you say Stephen, he is not a prolific striker, but they win the ball in the midfield, Jusbry Hall back then to Ghana and Ghana's going to go all the way to Pickford and we'll go back to Craven Cottage in our and Paul. 58 minutes in and it's taken that long for Fulham to have their first opportunity on goal, it's no no, but what a chance it was, Harry Wilson with a curling free kick just outside the D, it was heading into the top corner but propped out to the air from a flying Carl Darlo, no no. Aston Villa who have accrued more points, 101, and they've also scored more goals in 89 against Everton than any other side, but at the minute just cannot get this elusive first goal. Have we got a Swansea, no and Gwyneth? Swansea are back ahead, Swansea two a hurl one, bit of confusion in the hole, the fans they all stop when the ball is played from the left hand side, I thought the whistle had gone, Cross comes in, Ronald Flea in the box taps it in, Swansea two a hurl one. Complaint for nearly an hour, better, gets a blatant shove from behind by Mings but it's in a safe area of the field, midway through the Everton half. Let's get the teamers from West Ham, Alistair Bruce Ball. One change from West Ham from the 3-0 win away to Nottingham Forest, Crescencio Somerville starts, Nicholas Fulcrook is on the bench, Tottenham three changes from the 1-0 defeat against Bournemouth, last time out, Javi Cimons makes his debut, Matthias Telgett to first start of the season and Lucas Bergfau comes in, on the bench, Bentankur, Johnson and Rishalison, Kola Mouane not involved today. Sports report at five, followed at 5.30 with Ali and Paul Robinson, West Ham Tottenham, commentary at 5.30, 6-0-6 after that and then at 10 o'clock live world title boxing on BBC Radio Five Lives. If you've got a long journey taking you home on this Saturday then Five Lives should be your companion all the way through until, well, certainly until they were thought at 11 o'clock, depending on how that fight goes. Barnsley three, Reading one, no other goals to tell you about. Anybody on top for you in the second half? Well I think Villa have been a better team in terms of creating opportunities. Everton have just started now to get that press going but the one thing I was just looking at then, Denner, was the substitutions, both teams have got players that can come on and affect the game, change the game in a positive way so hopefully it won't be 0-0 for too much longer. Paul has gone out of play, it's an Everton throw that O'Brien takes quickly, Irribunam just tries to get out of the way from Watkins and then Keane will sweep the ball out towards that far side and Garner is able to turn and he finds Grealish, the player of the month for the Premier League in August and then he just slows it down and back towards Gay on the halfway line. Pat Murphy is at Stoke. Still 1-0 to Stoke, Birmingham more in this game in the second half, Stanfield prominent, he hit the side netting and he was almost through moments ago but Wilmott a great recovering tackle, he had to get that one right and he did. Stoke won Birmingham-0. Everton are attacking, Grealish on the left, just a correction for that team, he's Colin Mouane, actually on the bench for that 5-30 commentary. Tomorrow our games will be Burnley Liverpool at 2 and the Manchester Derby City vs United at 4-30. Here is Gay and that shaft of sunlight that is just now over on that far side of the field on the left. Keane, they're at walking pacer at Everton. Penalty at Bournemouth, Sir Hel Sahi. Penalty 4 Bournemouth, it's Bournemouth 1, Brighton 1, Everneilsson was fouled by Van Hecht, Semenyo is about to take it, just placing the ball on the spot. I think there is a chance for a U-Aurean but Semenyo is about to take it any moment now. Just moves away from the ball Bournemouth 1, Brighton 1, we've played an hour here, Semenyo up against Bournemouth, here he comes, right footed straight down the middle, Bournemouth 3-10 the lead, Bournemouth 2, Brighton 1. Crystal Palace 0, Sunderland 0, goal is between Fullamon Leeds United, Newcastle still lead, walls by a goal to 0 and here there was a chance for the Everton, well a couple of chances but there was an injury to an Aston Villa player who was down at the moment, it was Jusbri Hall who's cross, Martinez went in for a brave save and I think it was an Aston Villa player there that was injured in the process. Yeah it's Lucadino left back, he collides with both Martinez and Tyrone Mingz in trying to clear the ball but it was a bit messy for him, Martinez as the ball came in from Jusbri Hall, he just spilled it into the path and then tried to recover, didn't want to spill it too close to the Everton players but the game's just picked up and come to life a little bit again in the last couple of minutes but I think the concern is that it's actually a head injury that Lucadino has received there, is that a bruise to the side of his head? I'm just seeing there's a huge lump on the right side of his head, that is a concern, just trying to see how he's done that. Well so it's a stoppage in play, let's get a result to lead Davis Cup to Tennis, Russell Fuller. Yes Ian Cameron Norrie has completed the task for Great Britain beating Olaf Pieczkowski 6-4, 6-4 so Britain beat Poland 3-1 and will be in the draw for the first round of next year's Davis Cup. Still, Deenu's getting treatment trying the rugby Masferuki. Kanada with two trick tries here Ian, Alicia Corrigan and then Sophie de Goody, he's just about to take the conversion after she touched down herself. Australia had got their points on the board, their first point to this quarter final but Kanada starting to move through the gears, 15-5 they lead this rugby World Cup quarter final at the moment. Deenu's back on his feet which is good from an Aston Villa point of view. Yeah it is, saw the collision again, it was actually a lemon in joy as Deenu was falling to the floor, there was a knee to the side of the head of Luka Deenu. Now the good thing is he's back on his feet but it's just a concern of the concussion, we know how important that is in the Premier League and towards the player safety, Simon Hooper's actually going across to, I think just have a word again with him and see what the situation is. Falkirk Nils St Mirren 1 is the latest score in the Scottish Premier shoot, terrific noise inside this new stadium when the Everton fans are in full voice as they were with that flurry of activity before the injury. Villera down to 10, corner kick then from that far side almost drops towards and Jai, Tarkovsky's header took it out of his path and Jai now battles for the ball against two Aston Villa players, Bogart they will safely marshal it out for a goal kick and Deenu will come back on to the field of play once he's got the thumbs up from referee Simon Hooper which isn't at the moment. It's a frustrating rule of the 30 seconds now I know they say it's because you don't want them to feign injury but you can quite clearly see he's had a knock to the head he's got the bruise to show it, just letting back on the pitch, silly rule. Getting update from Ibrox Gavin Wallace. Yes though Rangers Nils, Hearts 1, Casano Deenu with a great shot just inside the box opened up his body really nicely and it had to be parried away by the goalkeeper Rangers Nils, Hearts 1. It remains Everton Nils, Aston Villa Nils, McGinn referee plays the advantage and then brings it back because the early ball McGinn was being held there by Jusbree Hall and Jusbree Hall is going to go into the book the second Everton player to be booked and the fourth yellow card that has been shown by Simon Hooper. I think it's a yellow card but I think it's too late in bringing the play back you've allowed it to go through to Morgan Rodgers and just because he's misplayed a pass he brings the play back well I think that's the wrong decision completely because doesn't matter if he misplaces the pass you've played on. Timir Abunam who was signed from Aston Villa for £9 million made 19 appearances comes off and Merlin Rool comes on at German under 21 international for his Everton debut they've got him on loan from Freiburg but it is with an obligation to buy for £17.3 million and David Moyes is hoping that he will be an energetic and athletic midfielder. 60 appearances and three goals in the last three years for Freiburg and so he comes on. He's a good player this guy I watched him in the under 21s against England for Germany he's that type of player who can see a pass but he's very elegant on the ball as well but got the athleticism to cover the ground up for a box to box midfielder. Got a great ovation then for his Everton debut it still remains goalless. Swansea Hull sitting in the championship. Oh and Gwyneth. Swansea to Hull won this game has settled down so John O'Donnell has restored our Swansea lead and substitutions for Swansea Adam Ida from the Alps Celtic they're £6 million signing on transfer deadline they has come on for a rapturous applause and welcome by the Swansea fans but currently Swansea to Hull won. Mill-Nill here five live in the World Service also available on the BBC sounds out this is gay inside his own half being chased by Rogers and then Keane turns and passes the ball back towards the Senegal international midfielder who's faced by McGinn out it goes to Ghana the left back down the line Greelys will give it back to to Ghana. I think we're going to see some activity on the Aston Villa bench. Harvey Elliott is going to be coming on. What sort of reception he might get? I think I'll be okay. Here is in Jai. Jaden Sancho and Victor Lindelof. Other acquisitions on deadline day are also on the bench but Harvey Elliott just shy of 150 appearances I was going to say across Stanley Park where we can no longer say that as Reading have got a gold back. Barnsley three Reading two here is Greelys trying to dance his way through over on that far side. Greelys almost snicted in the inside for the Jewsbury Hall cleared by Bogart up towards Buendia. Buendia making his 100th appearance for Aston Villa here today and in fact it will be Buendia who will be coming off for Harvey Elliott to make his Aston Villa debut. A loan from Liverpool but again obligation to buy for £35 million. Wimbledon two rather than United one is the latest score in league one. Aston Villa are attacking. Greelys. Gesson with a challenge. Did he get the ball? The referee says no and then gives a free kick to Aston Villa. Gesson falls over. That was hardly a shove at all from Greelys who gets a yellow card for his protest as we will go to Adam Cotter at Stockport. Stockport one. Cardiff Nill here. Cardiff heading towards their first defeat under Brian Barry Murphy. Stockport have created many chances in the second half already and Olly Norwood's first half penalty still separates the sides. Stockport one cardiff Nill. The yellow card was for adopting an aggressive attitude. Interesting. You can't do anything these days can you? Absolutely incredible. Wrexham have got a goal back. Wrexham won. Queen's part rangers two in the championship. We're midway through the second half and it remains Nill Nill. Harvey Elliott waits to come on. Mings is going to try and bring the ball forward but there was rule. Who would win the ball for Everton? Gay. Lays it out towards and Jai. Beto has stayed short. Sliding back with Gwendir. He says he got the ball and Jai rolls around. The supporters are up and out of their seats in front of us. Simon Hooper is calling the Aston Villa player towards him and it's just starting to get a little bit niggly. A bit of a feistyness in the game which is good. It's what you want to see but just hope Simon Hooper doesn't get carried away and think he's the centre of attention. So Gwendir will be shown yellow. He'll then be coming off the field of play to be substituted. We will go to sell his part. John Bennett. Crystal Palace Nill. Sunderland Nill. Huge evasion from the Sunderland fans for a deadline day signing. Brian Brobby on for Sunderland for his debut to try and win this game. Crystal Palace Nill. Sunderland Nill. Just over 20 minutes remaining then here in the first of our Premier League commentaries. We've got the Champions League to look forward to next week. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Three successive nights of Champions League coverage to bring you as Elliott is on and there are the booms that we talked about. So he's only played six minutes of football for Liverpool this season. He's taken to consideration the community shield and a last-minute appearance against Newcastle. Barrow have got to go back at Bristol Robes. Bristol Robes two. Barrow one. Mansfield Town Nill. Stevenage one is the latest scoring league one and you're up to date as Tuesday Hall waits to take this free kick and Pickford has actually come up to the halfway line and gives it back to Dewisbury Hall who can now inch his way forward. Floats it diagonal ball long left foot it out towards Grealish left hand side of the area up against Gesson. Gesson then will hold off Grealish dives into the challenge. Grealish quickly back off his knees back to his feet. Fronts up Gesson once again delivers the cross. Keywood ahead of Watta say by Enid Martinez. That was a world class save by Enid Martinez. It looked a certain goal. It was brilliant from Grealish on the right hand side nipping inside sorry the left hand side nips onto his right foot delivers a wicked ball and Keywood gets across his man. He wins that initial header gets the flick in front to Konza and that is an outstanding a world class save from Emi Martinez. That's why the Villafans are happy to have him back in the goal. You can tell how good it was it had the R reaction when they saw it on the giant screens corner taken quickly in towards Ilimanjai and then a sliding watch just blocks Ilimanjai and then in fact the referee has changed his mind as Jusbury Hall is preparing to take the corner. He's now said it will be a goal kick. 18 minutes remain still 0-0. Let's get an update from Newcastle Mike Minay. Changes have been made. Newcastle two of them including their goal scorer Nick Volta Marder on his debut. He scored his off or Shuler's on. Will it come for Joe Linton? Wolves have made a triple change as they chase an equaliser but they've been far from at it in this second half. Newcastle won Wolves 0-0 22 minutes left. Late Norrie at one ball to Wanderers 0 is the latest score in League one. The goal kick taken short. Everton poised to press. Emi Martinez has the ball at his feet and his lemon yellow in his six yard area. Now hits it right footed downfield. Keane in a bit of a tussle there. Wrestling match with Gesson runs through to Jusbury Hall. Links up once again with Grealish. Cash stays tight to him. Ball though quickly picks up off the little cone on that far side. Everton wanted to take the throw quickly but the ball had bounced back off one of the electronic hoardings and therefore we had two balls on the pitch and it just slows everything down. Yeah there's a lovely understanding between Grealish and Jusbury Hall. They linked up against Wolves for the Jusbury Hall goal but there's a real understanding between the two that they're trying to find each other. They know the runs they're trying to make and being the two positives for Everton again today. Swindon Town have come from behind and they're on course for a fifth straight win. Swindon two, Harrogate one, they look to match. Killing him the leaders, stride for stride at the top. Here is O'Brien trying to power his way forward being pulled back by Rogers and O'Brien as well fires in the cross off the legs of Dina and Everton get a throw right down by the corner flag. Mansfield Town have equalised at home to Stevenage in league one at Field Mill. Mansfield one, Stevenage one and Tino Barry is going to be coming on for Everton. So I'd imagine that that will be for for better wouldn't it? Like for like for the young forward that they signed from Via Real. Indeed it will. So O'Brien with a long throw into the penalty area and that was met very forcefully by Mings downward header and then that will be blocked. The attempted clearance by O'Brien and it goes out of play for a goal kick. So Tino Barry is going to come on and where will we go next? And it's Bournemouth to Hellside. 15 minutes to play here Bournemouth leading Brighton by two goals to one but this game very much on an eye-fed Brighton have made three changes in the last five minutes and they're going forward in search of a second equaliser. Bournemouth two, Brighton one. He's had chances to take the get the goal today better but as he gets a paddle about from David Moyes unable to do so that's why we're still locked at 0-0 with about 15 minutes remaining as we will go to Crystal Palace. Who's just had a chance? John Bennett. A big chance for Crystal Palace. Palace 0, Sunderland 0. Brilliant save by the Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Rooster tonight. Kamada low shot great one man handed save. Palace 0, Sunderland 0. Goal is there, goal is here. Also goal is at Fullham Aaron Paul. Yeah still 0-0. A couple of big chances to Fullham. Rodrigo Munez with a header well saved by Karl Dahlert and Emil Smithrow clipping the outside of the post with a shot. Record signing Kevin is on Fullham. 0-0. Throw for Everton. Oh Brian to take it goes in field towards Keen. These are the latest scores in the Scottish Premiership. Aberdeen 0, Livingston 0. Dundee 1, Motherwell 1. Falkirk 0, St. Mirren 1. Ranges still trailing to Hartz by a goal to 0 at Ibrox. Lauren Shanklin with that first half goal that would take Hartz three points clear of Celtic who play tomorrow at Kilmarnock. Aston Villa have got a free kick which has been knocked short and square by Mings to Conser got his first goal for England in midweek in that impressive performance against Serbia in Belgrade McGinn now towards Mings over the halfway line along the ground laid off by Elliott. Cash just forced to retreat a little bit still inside the Villa half out towards Guessan but it's a nice gentle walking pace isn't it Stephen? Yeah they're not in a rush to to lose the ball here Aston Villa they realise that whenever Everton pick up the ball the pace of the game picks up and this is the style that Unai Emery likes his teams to play in but now we see that tussling that gritty determination from Everton as they win the ball back again. Aston Villa have never failed to score in their first four games of a league season. Nil nil it remains. In league two the two results acting to one Colchester nil Crawley beat Cheltenham two nil these are the latest scores Bristol Rovers two Barrow one Chesterfield nil MK Donnes one crew one Barnett one as Pickford clears Fleetwood one Walsall one Jillingham lead Knotts County by a goal to nil Grimsby nil Cambridge United one Alderman Bromley is goalless so Bromley still unbeaten Shrewsbury one Salford one Swindantown two Harrogate one Tramir Rovers lead Newport County by a goal to nil so that would mean that both Jillingham and Swindon would be locked together on 18 points if it stays like

Mark Chapman minks to Deenia forward able then to get a first time cross and Jai goes back with him takes a lot of the pace off the ball out it goes for an Aston Villa throw down by the corner flag

in league one we've got nine minutes remaining you're listening to BBC Radio 5 live is there to be a breakthrough goal in the stalemate here at the hill Dickinson Stadium Everton oppressing nings with a clearance Barry links up with and Jai nice little turn there from rule comes back then to and Jai passes it towards Tuesbury Hall Everton trying to build late pressure O'Brien sends over a diagonal cross spreads it to the left hand side really nice touch enter the penalty area won't spin out though towards Garner and Elliot will play the ball out wide ball cash to clear it will go to John Bennett itself has parked Crystal Palace Nils Sunderland Niel another brilliant save by the Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Rufus flick by Mateta close range he got he stopped it with his body brilliant block Palace Nils Sunderland Niel Grealis twists and turns on that left hand side and then twists one many too many times and it goes out for a goal kick Volker Nils St Mirren two is the latest score in the Scottish Premiership yeah it's trying to build up a bit of momentum there Jack Grealish and he'd actually turn Matty Cash inside out but John McGinn had covered him extremely well just overcooks the last part of the of the run now Aston Villa make those changes and whilst those changes happen Oli Watkins is one of them to come off that six villa appearances now without any goals doniel Marlon comes on to replace him we'll go to Aaron Paul at Fulham yes seven to go here Ian Fulham Nils leads Nils to the half-carts for Fulham Sasser just in front of the goalkeeper on the half turn able to swivel get some contact on the ball no real purchase on the shot and it just drips wide on the lead post and it's been one of them afternings here on the banks of the Thames seven to go Niel Niel like Manu at Newcastle well he's still Newcastle one-walls Niel but the walls analysts in the press box here have just become a little animated as have the walls staffing the technical area their side building trying to get an equaliser at the other end Harvey Barnes has killed one wide when a nice slick move infield from the left he sent it well away from goal when he should have done better walls one sorry Newcastle one-walls nearly 11 to go commentary that is on sports extra Niel Niel Everton are attacking left hand side really now the little purpose out towards Garner first time cross comes in swept away there by Consa just trying to see where Lindelot is playing center mid harvests thinking it when he when he came on the one thing I would say is there has been another number three who played center midfield for Aston Villa was that you it was yeah a long time ago so in one of those 101 appearances yeah I played there quite a few times actually but uh very surprised to see him in there I was just like he came on for Bogart that was the substitution I was just thinking have they gone to a back three and you're right he's in the he's in the midfield Shrewsbury 1 Salford City 2 no other goals to tell you about up and down the country BBC Radio 5 live apart from Oldham have just taken the lead at Boundary Park and that might be the end of Bronleys and beaten start to the season Oldham won Bronle Niel is in league two so Martinez made that terrific save to keep out Keane's header ball up over the head of Marlon and gathered in by Pickford Marlon's leading the line now isn't he yeah he is and Harvey Elliot's just playing in behind him I don't think I'd say about Harvey Elliot is hasn't been able to impact this game whatsoever in the second half since coming on to the pitch here is Grealish holds off cash out to Tuesbury Hall garner's forward on the overlap if he can get the ball to him he was hauled to the ground though by Gesser that will be a free kick to Everton update from the Hawthorns Charlie Slater 83 minutes on the clock purely against the run played Derby are in front substitute Andy Vyman took his time found the bottom corner it's West Brom Niel Derby won Cormoranston Villa player could provide Derby County with their first win of the season and end West Bromwich Albion's unbeaten start to the season this free kick then for Everton we remain Niel Niel we've got about five and a bit minutes remaining they take it short towards Grealish teases his way forward lays it off then to Ghana he goes square this is Roel who's going to shoot from distance it was a good 30 yards out right but it always on the rise penalty at Ibrox Gavin Wallace Harry Mellon was upended he burst into the box then up at Charlotte Lawrence Shanklin after a lengthy bar check will step up now he takes five six seven eight steps back just takes a little bit of a breather referee not quite happy without everyone is standing yet Elton Kibangu's been told of Harris just to watch his foot on the line at the edge of the whistle goes now Lawrence Shanklin will step up can he double Hart's lead away here at Rangers he goes to the right foot Jack Ballant says that Shanklin down the rebound and it's another goal for Hart's that is Rangers now Hart's two Shanklin with his six of the season his second of the day and Rangers are all over the place Rangers now Hart's two well Russell Martin was under severe pressure going into the old firm game against Celtic which they drew in that nil nil draw before the international break we said then it was their worst start in 42 years that pressure will only mount I'm sure Chesterfield one MK Don's one nil nil it remains here this is five live and the world service with four minutes remaining this is mings now over the halfway line out to this near left hand side Dean you're back with that with mings mind you talking about a worst start failure to win here today for refer Aston Villa will be their worst start in 28 years McGinn tries to hold off rule gay comes into help out referee says his shirt was being pulled it'll be an Aston Villa free kick on the halfway line yeah I think the shirt was being pulled a long time before and Simon Hooper just wanted to see whether McGinn could roll his way out of that situation we've seen it many a time so he obviously knows the style of John McGinn but he did get to the right decision eventually but it's interesting watching Hoonai Emery and David Moise both on the edge of the technical areas at mood Hoonai Emery's near enough on the halfway line on the pitch Marlon lays it off Rogers looks for the return ball is over hit it Marlon was running away from it anyway and it went straight out of play for a goal kick only four teams have failed to score in the first four of a Premier League season the last was Crystal Palace in the 17-18 campaign when they actually failed to score in their first seven matches but with three minutes remaining this is heading for a goal of stalemate here is rolling the midfield the German under 21 international passes it out wide to this near side the right and O'Brien towards and Jai tries to roll away from Deena rolls to the floor loses the ball McGinn picks it up now for Aston Villa McGinn through the centre circle Cash joins the attack Lindelof playing in the midfield he was signed on a free two-year deal on deadline day Jaden Sancho his former Manchester United teammate not utilized as Newport County have equalized at Trenton Park Tramia 1 Newport County 1 is a latest score in League 2 Aston Villa have the ball we have two minutes of normal time remaining O'Brien is hopping in that tiny technical area down below very very animated I think there's a feeling from him is that he wants his team to speed up the process they're in Everton forward up towards Barry nins has to come across Barry accelerates and Barry has the shot as he goes in left-footed nins diverts it behind for a corner kick he did well minks he did superbly well because he just slowed himself down you knew exactly where he wanted Barry to go if he'd dived in and be in any quicker to get across he allows Barry to cut inside he didn't allow that to happen the corner's been taken though corner taken quickly and here is Grealish inside that left side of the penalty area back to Dewisbury Hall that was blocked comes out to Tarkovsky O'Brien now right hand side of the penalty area looks to churn wins the corner Marlon got the block in nil nil corner kicked to Everton yeah pressure from Everton late on a good period of possession good period of pressure for Everton big chance now to fizz one under the crossbar put Emmy Martinez under pressure it's something that they've been looking to do at every opportunity Tarkovsky is round Martinez Barry is round him Michael Keen's round him making life difficult for him Tavoma two Brighton one no goals at Palace full and all here Newcastle still lead walls by a goal to nil but Everton have back this corner kick on this near side the right and by my watch we've just entered the last 60 seconds of normal time Dewisbury Hall to take it Illuminant Giles available if you want the short one they don't they put it into the mixer and it's pushed away by Martinez collected left hand side of the penalty area by Grealish Grealish pulls it back Garner's first time shot blocked from McGinn loops onto the roof of the net behind for another corner yeah superb John McGinn brilliant from Grealish initially just to draw a couple of Aston players towards him to allow that space for Garner to get the shot in but McGinn throws his body on the line now it's about the composure from Everton it's up another quick one another quick one on the left hand side again to Grealish he wants Garner to come to the edge of the area Grealish Grealish tries to create that shooting opportunity in the end he sliced it miscued it comes out towards and Jai he shoots it strikes the chest of concert and Aston Villa get the ball away and it goes out from Everton throw and Everton will try and maintain this pressure as five minutes have added on time juice free hall back towards gay out it goes to Grealish he's the go-to man Grealish controls the ball left corner of the area Grealish goes on the outside Grealish finds Keane and Keane throws himself at it comes up on the top of his head and goes out wide for a goal kick as we go to sell hers park and John Bennett it's Crystal Palace Nils Sunderland Niel Moore says from Robin Rousse the Sunderland goalkeeper he denies Uche and Kamada it's Niel Niel no other goals elsewhere if that ballpark have just got a goal back for Kirk wants a mirror and two and cash has gone down with a touch of cramp but Everton were really building a lot of momentum late on yeah they were and it's brilliant from Jack Grealish on that left hand side I'm thinking to myself take him on down the line he haven't taken him on enough down the line so he gets that little dink cross credit to Michael Keane he gets on the end of it we've always stretching always a difficult ball to get a header on target did you see radio five live with sports report coming up in about 10 minutes time Martinez being given the hurry up from the evidence supporters behind him in that towering stamp net by Keane's header and concert will go all the way back to Martinez Barry runs towards him he passes the ball out wide to Ming's back to Charlie Slater at the Hawthorne into six minutes of additional time West Brom throwing everything at this now trying to get an equalizer Malumbi's just thumped the crossbar a moment ago West Brom Niel Derby won. Dynia wait the ball for Aston Villa now Aston Villa can come forward in search of a late winner in stoppage time here on five live in the world service McGinn and Dynia exchange passes ball lifted over the top by McGinn to Dynia look like it had gone out of play sends over the cross Gesson waits referee has not assistant on that far side has not raised his flag Gesson battles for it and it will be a goal kick still the evidence supporters believe they can conjure up a late goal here Stephen yeah they do and trying to get the ball moving as quick as possible the evidence fans are just making sure that the players believe that they can get something out of this game trying to lift the noise trying to lift the volume but for Aston Villa it's imperative that they don't lose this football game it's been a portart start to the season but just something like a nil nil here a point on the board can give them so much belief going forward it's not nil nil at Craven cottage any longer Aaron Paul they won this in the dead Gabriel Goodman some deflecting into his own net Tom Kearney running away for Bullum they won't care the balls in the back of the net and Bullum could be on the way to their first three points of this new Premier League season full of one lead tonight's in Nile almost still lead Brighton 2-1 Crystal Palace Sunderland nil nil full of a mirror ahead there Newcastle still lead walls by a goal to nil Swindon 3 Harrogate Town 1 is the latest score in league 2 Shrewsbury 1 Salford City 3 is the latest score nil nil here Jusbury Hall swings over the cross Dean is underneath and inside the penalty area to head the ball away Gaye comes forward to and Jai the two Senegal internationals link up gay almost loses the ball and then guides it towards Tarkovsky forward towards O'Brien first time cross comes in Barry is there heads it off target collected by Dina clattered away to safety for Aston Villa met by the head of Tarkovsky edge of the area flicked on by rule for Everton cleared on the half volley then by Tyro Minxley gets distance repelled by the head of Keen outside the centre circle inside the Everton half nice touch by N'Jai comes into a central area out it goes to Greenwich Greenwich with purpose again runs at cash who backpedals and then the last touch came off really struck the heels of cash hit the chest of Greenwich and out for a goal kick Steven Warner yeah he just had that roar as the ball went out to Jack Greenwich that sense of anticipation what can he do what can he make happen but Matty Cash stood up to the challenge just did enough and as you say ricocheted into the face of Jack Greenwich to run out of play but Unai Emery down in front of us just again once more from his team he's not happy with the performance he's seen today in the Premier League Arsenal top of the table and Poster Coglu in his first game losing as the learning and forest manager Bournemouth are going to join Aston and Liverpool on nine points as it currently stands first wins for Fullerman Newcastle Crystal Palace to extend their unbeaten run to 15 matches in all competitions which is the longest as a top flight club Everton will remain unbeaten here in their new surroundings and for Aston Villa they will remain as the only side in the top six tiers in England yet to score this season because of the five minutes that are added on we're inside the last 30 seconds Pickford throws it out goes long left footed cleared by Cash Marlon will give chase might get there before Tarkovsky Tarkovsky had to get their first flags up anyway Marlon thought might have just had the beating of him well Everton might just miss and rue those chances that fell for Beto in the first half and then the brilliance of Martinez in the second and they were the big chances for Beto should have done better should have had this game put to bed or at least given the Everton fans or the Everton team an opportunity to push on and win the game that could be the difference between winning a game and just getting a point Everton have been awarded a free kick and he's just inside the Aston Villa half by my watch the minimum of five has already been used this is only going one way and you can hear the Everton roar inside then you have urging Pickford left footed to put it to the edge of the area nil nil Pickford does exactly that Billers defense drop inside the penalty area and then Harvey Elliott clears the ball away and there indeed is the final whistle Everton nil Aston Villa nil and Aston Villa their worst start in 28 years since the 97 98 campaign and for the first time in their history they have failed to score in their opening four games they've drawn a blank ever to get a point Stephen Warner yeah not a classic of a game but a game that was on the line for both teams at certain points within the game Everton started the much better team Aston Villa found the feet in the first half slowly came back into the game and then they started the better team in the second half but Everton much much stronger at the end they'll be the team that are bitterly disappointed two big opportunities for Beto should have been three points for Everton but it's a positive for Aston Villa a clean sheet points on the board something to build from. Emy Martinez with a number of superb saves two in the first half one with his legs with that brilliant effort kept out keen as it finishes here Everton nil Aston Villa nil
