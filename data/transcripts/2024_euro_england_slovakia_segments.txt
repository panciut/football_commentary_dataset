[0.00 - 5.56] P:1581.34 E:0.046803 |  ...and Rice and Bellingham, Sacher on the right, Thorne on the left, and Harry Kane up front.
[5.56 - 11.08] P:1721.38 E:0.101429 |  So whatever temptation there was for Garis Southgate to change his team, just the one change.
[11.08 - 14.16] P:1663.24 E:0.100292 |  And Slovakia unchanged, Dubravka with Newcastle and Goal,
[14.16 - 19.08] P:1664.97 E:0.100959 |  Peckery, Vavros, Skriniy, the captain and Hansko, Kutka, Lobotka and Duda,
[19.08 - 25.04] P:1658.59 E:0.101754 |  Strants, Haraslín in the wide positions, as Harry Kane actually has the ball cleared into him,
[25.08 - 32.24] P:1564.46 E:0.095540 |  and it bounces straight through to Dubravka on the bounce, no worries for Slovakia,
[32.24 - 35.40] P:1482.51 E:0.094919 |  but that'll count as England's first decent on target.
[35.40 - 39.64] P:1430.16 E:0.103180 |  That would have been the most random goal you'll ever see if that would have gone in.
[39.64 - 43.04] P:1546.15 E:0.099535 |  I mean, the ricochet, they do a different start, aren't they, Slovakia?
[43.04 - 46.80] P:1569.98 E:0.099266 |  They play it back, one of the centre backs sets the other one to go long,
[46.80 - 50.72] P:1701.33 E:0.102424 |  and Harry Kane just sprinted straight forward, jumped, that almost rugby style really, wasn't it?
[50.72 - 54.72] P:1585.10 E:0.096981 |  Just blocking a kick and ricocheted off him straight into the goalkeeper's hands.
[54.80 - 57.36] P:1677.71 E:0.104156 |  And the other member of the Slovakia team that was running through there,
[57.36 - 64.32] P:1512.03 E:0.095259 |  it is significant, Davide Strelitz has been chosen up front rather than Boschiennik,
[64.32 - 69.72] P:1413.36 E:0.094441 |  who started the first two matches, that was the big talking point for Slovakia.
[69.72 - 76.36] P:1494.28 E:0.100869 |  So, Strelitz it is, and we are off and under way, England and Slovakia in the round of 16,
[76.36 - 81.96] P:1447.63 E:0.097795 |  here at the Euros, this is for the right to play Switzerland in the quarterfinals
[82.04 - 86.76] P:1619.11 E:0.092521 |  in Dusseldorf on Saturday. England in the all-white kit again,
[86.76 - 92.80] P:1348.05 E:0.093958 |  or at least with the blue trim up the side, and England, everyone looking to see what sort of performance this will be,
[92.80 - 95.52] P:1280.17 E:0.099172 |  whether they will be able to move the ball more quickly,
[95.52 - 99.12] P:1423.13 E:0.101352 |  it's back in front of the penalty area with Stones and Gay,
[99.12 - 104.76] P:1492.67 E:0.112962 |  and Gay now just taps the ball back to Jordan Pickford on the edge of the six yard box,
[104.76 - 110.64] P:1424.39 E:0.100760 |  who works it out to John Stones, who will give it back to Pickford again,
[110.72 - 113.32] P:1407.96 E:0.114945 |  and already this is the very very patient approach,
[113.32 - 116.20] P:1358.17 E:0.109419 |  as Pickford on his left foot chips it out here to the right side,
[116.20 - 119.04] P:1316.62 E:0.102236 |  as England play from left to right in this first period,
[119.04 - 123.96] P:1413.90 E:0.090599 |  Walker goes back to Stones who just draws the challenge from Strelitz,
[123.96 - 127.20] P:1505.86 E:0.110336 |  and then Pickford actually is going to carry the ball out of the penalty area on his own,
[127.20 - 131.84] P:1520.19 E:0.091826 |  and hits that long left footed pass that is flicked in field by the head of Bellingham,
[131.84 - 136.52] P:1467.58 E:0.099399 |  comes back to Bellingham, no it's just taken away from an in-center field by LeBott,
[136.52 - 138.96] P:1496.42 E:0.108529 |  Bellingham the day after his 21st birthday,
[138.96 - 142.68] P:1567.26 E:0.109561 |  and then the first Slovakia attack down the right front,
[142.68 - 144.52] P:1390.43 E:0.111187 |  plates down and it's a throw into him.
[144.52 - 150.20] P:1492.38 E:0.110233 |  Lovely car play from LeBott, there, that holding midfield pivot for Slovakia,
[150.20 - 152.00] P:1660.98 E:0.116563 |  brought the ball down, cool as you like,
[152.00 - 156.12] P:1520.34 E:0.104226 |  he really does look the part actually in the heart of the Slovakia midfield.
[156.12 - 161.12] P:1583.05 E:0.097156 |  Yep, the number 22, the Napoli man who plays for the coach, Francesco Calzona,
[161.12 - 163.60] P:1570.66 E:0.095406 |  for both country and club, Calzona,
[163.68 - 166.56] P:1567.89 E:0.089317 |  who had two jobs for the latter part of the season,
[166.56 - 169.28] P:1701.16 E:0.106798 |  coach of Napoli, long crossfield pass from Walker,
[169.28 - 171.52] P:1658.81 E:0.091210 |  the crowd like that, Trippier infield to Foulden,
[171.52 - 174.68] P:1674.46 E:0.083961 |  he gets his first touch of the match, back to Trippier again,
[174.68 - 176.76] P:1384.63 E:0.088385 |  now he has Declan Rice infield,
[176.76 - 179.64] P:1573.42 E:0.095641 |  Manu with his first touch, confident, first time,
[179.64 - 182.20] P:1536.07 E:0.093021 |  Crisp turned it back into his own half,
[182.20 - 186.12] P:1442.30 E:0.103401 |  England now on the left hand side, Slovakia in the all blue,
[186.12 - 188.80] P:1717.12 E:0.112063 |  that pass was a little short, all game with the challenge,
[188.80 - 191.72] P:1593.49 E:0.097588 |  that's going to be a yellow card, and that's a problem,
[191.72 - 193.16] P:1493.41 E:0.109689 |  that is a problem for England,
[193.16 - 197.00] P:1622.43 E:0.103011 |  because Gay is one of the England men on a yellow card,
[197.00 - 201.60] P:1601.61 E:0.094604 |  and if England go through, Mark Gay will be suspended for the quarterfinal.
[201.60 - 205.20] P:1540.75 E:0.094441 |  Well, it's funny, we were just talking with Joe beforehand about the yellow cards,
[205.20 - 207.36] P:1317.46 E:0.086775 |  when the screen came up with the teams,
[207.36 - 209.76] P:1494.63 E:0.106264 |  it's a real shame because he's been so key,
[209.76 - 213.24] P:1471.73 E:0.091789 |  but he's sold short by Kieran Trippier's pass back to him,
[213.24 - 214.68] P:1598.59 E:0.104315 |  he's on the touchline Trippier,
[214.68 - 217.28] P:1535.01 E:0.095271 |  and he just doesn't fire the ball into him with enough intensity,
[217.28 - 219.92] P:1370.36 E:0.088056 |  he's too slow, he's rolling towards him,
[219.92 - 222.04] P:1347.59 E:0.099376 |  and puts him banging trouble really,
[222.04 - 224.60] P:1626.89 E:0.105119 |  John, he picks up that yellow card early in this game as well,
[224.60 - 225.68] P:1535.10 E:0.092617 |  God be careful.
[225.68 - 228.36] P:1591.73 E:0.096320 |  That's very much the other side of it,
[228.36 - 231.04] P:1602.46 E:0.094812 |  and Trippier with the pass that was short,
[231.04 - 234.64] P:1529.40 E:0.101158 |  so it's a free kick to Slovakia, out towards the right hand side,
[234.64 - 240.08] P:1449.95 E:0.093387 |  so that is a big early setback for England on a number of levels,
[240.08 - 242.72] P:1631.18 E:0.114558 |  and clearly there will be a discussion over who it is,
[242.72 - 245.00] P:1533.28 E:0.086272 |  who comes in if England progress.
[245.00 - 247.72] P:1432.96 E:0.110965 |  Here's the free kick into the penalty area, which is deflected wide,
[247.72 - 249.52] P:1485.81 E:0.088603 |  there were two men going for it,
[249.52 - 254.72] P:1444.29 E:0.094120 |  and I think it came off the knee of Stravitz,
[254.72 - 257.32] P:1417.71 E:0.096372 |  and went wide, great delivery.
[257.32 - 259.44] P:1504.33 E:0.102181 |  That is a big chance, big, big chance,
[259.44 - 260.72] P:1555.67 E:0.110779 |  I think they get in each other's way.
[260.72 - 261.60] P:1393.39 E:0.088774 |  They do.
[261.60 - 264.28] P:1539.39 E:0.111313 |  The players, I mean, if he just manages to get his head on that,
[264.28 - 267.60] P:1342.91 E:0.099816 |  it's a fantastic delivery, perfect angle of pace,
[267.60 - 271.60] P:1260.99 E:0.106608 |  just dropped into the right area, real warning shot.
[271.60 - 275.84] P:1394.49 E:0.103219 |  It's actually Stravitz who got in just in front of Kutska,
[275.84 - 277.76] P:1144.51 E:0.111319 |  and that deflected wide of the goal.
[277.84 - 282.36] P:1461.93 E:0.097260 |  England nil, Slovakia nil, there's the first warning.
[282.36 - 286.24] P:1501.43 E:0.102715 |  And they are dangerous, remember, even though this Slovakia team
[286.24 - 288.08] P:1593.16 E:0.111006 |  is ranked 45th in the world,
[288.08 - 290.60] P:1505.97 E:0.094255 |  they've already beaten Belgium at this tournament,
[290.60 - 292.84] P:1511.56 E:0.094781 |  Slovakia one of the third-place qualifiers,
[292.84 - 294.36] P:1696.86 E:0.104837 |  Walker's out of position.
[294.36 - 296.96] P:1624.49 E:0.101877 |  Now here's the dangerous Haras Linn on the left,
[296.96 - 298.64] P:1605.11 E:0.106327 |  Haras Linn into the penalty area,
[298.64 - 302.20] P:1613.09 E:0.104363 |  gives it to his left, and the ball right across the face of goal,
[302.20 - 304.96] P:1623.53 E:0.092090 |  driven there by Hanskjord, the left back,
[305.00 - 306.60] P:1647.63 E:0.099112 |  picked for diving down to his left,
[306.60 - 310.00] P:1627.71 E:0.097091 |  but we had the perfect angle, we knew it was going wide of the far post.
[310.00 - 313.12] P:1535.28 E:0.089974 |  It's been a sloppy start, I have to say.
[313.12 - 316.88] P:1512.82 E:0.093708 |  England not really at the races, not moving the ball quickly,
[316.88 - 320.20] P:1501.63 E:0.093384 |  Walker loses out the tackle, and the Slovakian team,
[320.20 - 322.68] P:1523.39 E:0.097640 |  I mean, it's a brilliant counter-attack in terms of the break,
[322.68 - 324.44] P:1603.59 E:0.073283 |  they get bodies forward,
[324.44 - 328.08] P:1588.10 E:0.087083 |  and he just cannot find the right pass there, Hanskjord, the left back.
[328.08 - 330.84] P:1661.68 E:0.101931 |  He's so advanced, he's put too much angle on it, it's not a shot,
[330.84 - 333.16] P:1480.63 E:0.076956 |  it's not a cross, it's kind of in between,
[333.20 - 334.88] P:1608.54 E:0.114836 |  he's better off choosing one or the other there,
[334.88 - 336.84] P:1449.11 E:0.088313 |  but another real warning shot.
[336.84 - 339.44] P:1514.95 E:0.092667 |  Here on Five Live for the commentary, we've got Matt Upsson,
[339.44 - 342.72] P:1530.46 E:0.096685 |  played at the World Cup for England, we've got Joe Hart, 75 caps,
[342.72 - 345.92] P:1412.34 E:0.095957 |  we've got Izzy Christiansen down behind the goal as well.
[345.92 - 349.92] P:1477.48 E:0.092461 |  Let's bring in Joe, that's an uncertain start from England, Joe.
[349.92 - 353.32] P:1534.28 E:0.086745 |  Yeah, I liked the first two minutes, I did,
[353.32 - 357.24] P:1622.95 E:0.092649 |  and then I thought Slovakia looked very comfortable, press, shape, look at this,
[357.24 - 358.64] P:1624.02 E:0.090575 |  their shape's low, isn't it?
[358.64 - 361.96] P:1695.81 E:0.098019 |  Yeah, but the shape's exceptional, they're ready, they're really ready to pounce,
[361.96 - 365.40] P:1602.89 E:0.097336 |  and that first, you know, mind and mistake that Kieran Tripier made,
[365.40 - 367.40] P:1613.50 E:0.113678 |  obviously, Gimmart Gahey picking up the yellow card,
[367.40 - 369.40] P:1822.25 E:0.119348 |  which is difficult in the third minute, here's Saka.
[369.40 - 372.36] P:1726.44 E:0.102988 |  Yeah, that's great from Saka, round his man to Baligham,
[372.36 - 374.44] P:1635.40 E:0.102886 |  Baligham in the penalty area, in comes the tackle,
[374.44 - 378.92] P:1732.92 E:0.096263 |  Menu's there on the edge of the box, gives it back to Saka, Saka, left footed,
[378.92 - 383.00] P:1681.52 E:0.108091 |  uses Menu, Menu back to Saka, Saka could be in, in comes the challenge,
[383.00 - 386.48] P:1659.50 E:0.105824 |  they miss the clearance, and then eventually scrap it away,
[386.48 - 391.88] P:1613.32 E:0.108550 |  and actually the referee, who is the Turkish referee, Ulut Meler,
[391.96 - 395.12] P:1604.66 E:0.105465 |  has shown a yellow card to Pukaj O Saka,
[395.12 - 398.20] P:1599.69 E:0.097125 |  as he was trying to get to the ball, he was late in on the challenge,
[398.20 - 401.80] P:1449.59 E:0.098583 |  and caught his man, and it's a free kick, and I mean, Harry Kane has gone to the referee,
[401.80 - 406.04] P:1484.93 E:0.094772 |  shaking his head, and Menu, it is, who put in the challenge,
[406.04 - 407.88] P:1477.62 E:0.096664 |  and it is Menu who is booked.
[407.88 - 412.04] P:1521.32 E:0.094395 |  Yeah, it's an interesting yellow card, really, because he's making a attempt to the ball,
[412.04 - 416.20] P:1616.34 E:0.093136 |  and he just stands on the foot of the ball, I mean, I think that's harsh for a yellow card,
[416.20 - 418.76] P:1540.27 E:0.098451 |  to be honest, I mean, he's not going in with any real force,
[418.76 - 421.40] P:1502.97 E:0.089441 |  and he doesn't really snap down on it, but it was stringy,
[421.40 - 425.56] P:1296.54 E:0.088974 |  I think with the block, wasn't it, Saka almost in on goal,
[425.56 - 428.92] P:1273.39 E:0.090103 |  and the big centre-back just gets a vital block in for Slovakia.
[428.92 - 433.08] P:1538.75 E:0.095466 |  That happened at the end, where Izzy Christensen is behind the goal, Izzy.
[433.08 - 435.08] P:1539.92 E:0.110283 |  Yeah, that's what Pukaj O Saka is all about, isn't it?
[435.08 - 437.56] P:1549.18 E:0.104041 |  What we've been missing, maybe, in the first couple of games,
[437.56 - 441.56] P:1450.27 E:0.089566 |  is him coming to the byline, and chopping in, and getting a cross in.
[441.56 - 443.64] P:1388.99 E:0.089861 |  Really good start from Pukaj O Saka.
[443.64 - 447.00] P:1530.75 E:0.100729 |  It's a great touch as well from Saka, from the long task,
[447.08 - 451.88] P:1577.60 E:0.099076 |  that took him away from handscored, the highly rated left back,
[451.88 - 457.24] P:1520.09 E:0.100541 |  as Slovakia come forward with Skrinjar, now into the central area,
[457.24 - 461.32] P:1408.39 E:0.104556 |  to the number 17, Haras Linn, square from him to Kutska.
[461.32 - 465.88] P:1468.82 E:0.103800 |  Kutska lifts a right-footed ball, Strelets back to the edge of the penalty area,
[465.88 - 469.24] P:1532.46 E:0.098660 |  Haras Linn with a shot, that hits stones, comes out again,
[469.24 - 472.04] P:1527.44 E:0.102763 |  Kutska with the ball right across the six-yard area,
[472.04 - 473.56] P:1632.15 E:0.112701 |  and all the way through for a goal kick.
[474.12 - 475.56] P:1365.92 E:0.094059 |  Um...
[475.56 - 476.60] P:1505.47 E:0.094920 |  Lively start.
[476.60 - 480.76] P:1453.68 E:0.091248 |  Very lively start, and a really strong start from Slovakia.
[480.76 - 484.20] P:1422.55 E:0.100483 |  Three chances now they've created, lovely passing play,
[484.20 - 486.68] P:1284.66 E:0.100730 |  get it into the front, it gets set back stones with the block,
[486.68 - 489.80] P:1377.98 E:0.091326 |  but the amount of time and space the midfield players have got
[489.80 - 493.24] P:1341.59 E:0.101240 |  to get the ball and pick their pass, nearly another really good ball
[493.24 - 497.72] P:1422.18 E:0.086841 |  from Kutska into that area, but the quality's been good from Slovakia.
[497.72 - 502.12] P:1515.02 E:0.088435 |  Slovakia, let me remind you, 37 attempts on goal
[502.20 - 504.68] P:1633.07 E:0.082181 |  during the three matches in the group stages,
[504.68 - 508.20] P:1542.81 E:0.083186 |  and they've shown here, well, they've carried on that form, haven't they?
[508.20 - 512.20] P:1758.62 E:0.091599 |  Here, positive start from Francesco Calzona's team,
[512.20 - 516.04] P:1816.20 E:0.106979 |  and an uncomfortable start for England with bookings for Gae and Manu.
[516.04 - 519.48] P:1873.06 E:0.100574 |  Here is Manu, and we're still only in the eighth minute,
[519.48 - 521.96] P:1728.65 E:0.088619 |  two England men boot, Walker,
[521.96 - 525.24] P:1676.48 E:0.096948 |  who's back to stones on the edge of the box.
[525.24 - 529.96] P:1632.47 E:0.101865 |  England flags draped all around this blue stadium of Shalka,
[530.52 - 534.52] P:1580.25 E:0.090148 |  forward towards Bukayo Saka, that first touch of the match will make
[534.52 - 538.84] P:1528.92 E:0.095481 |  him feel good, I'm sure, Saka to Walker,
[538.84 - 541.40] P:1571.91 E:0.096134 |  and then England go back into their own half.
[541.40 - 544.12] P:1591.92 E:0.112958 |  Walker points to down the line, Bellingham is there,
[544.12 - 546.84] P:1589.16 E:0.109355 |  out on the right-hand side, Saka as well, Bellingham's ball,
[546.84 - 550.44] P:1625.09 E:0.113242 |  all the way across, and then Trippier on his right foot arriving,
[550.44 - 554.20] P:1628.90 E:0.103519 |  absolutely skies the effort, arriving on it on his right foot,
[554.20 - 557.32] P:1600.06 E:0.100196 |  just inside the penalty area, halfway up the stand.
[557.40 - 560.44] P:1546.13 E:0.107092 |  Lovely ball from Bellingham, sees the space out wide,
[560.44 - 565.16] P:1577.33 E:0.099700 |  it really opens up, and Trippier, he just doesn't get his upper body over the ball.
[565.16 - 568.44] P:1586.50 E:0.091533 |  It's quite a tough one, it's a funny technique, the way he strikes it actually,
[568.44 - 571.64] P:1608.47 E:0.090229 |  doesn't really connect with the ball cleanly,
[571.64 - 575.24] P:1531.23 E:0.101753 |  it's perfect weight for him really to strike first time, but he's always leaning back.
[578.28 - 583.48] P:1631.78 E:0.096908 |  As Slavakia take a short goal kick and clear it away towards the halfway line,
[583.96 - 587.16] P:1418.65 E:0.091561 |  Bellingham, that was an excellent pass from Jude Bellingham,
[587.16 - 591.56] P:1578.51 E:0.101393 |  to spot the opportunity and the space that there was there for Kieran Trippier,
[591.56 - 592.92] P:1521.14 E:0.094272 |  who couldn't take advantage.
[592.92 - 597.88] P:1552.93 E:0.101585 |  So Slavakia break back towards the halfway line, that's given away to Pocayo Saka,
[597.88 - 605.24] P:1503.39 E:0.087875 |  Saka now back to Manu, Manu, who shuffles it forward, Declan Rice to his left,
[605.24 - 609.16] P:1600.55 E:0.098735 |  here's Jude Bellingham, who's made a positive start, I must say,
[609.80 - 613.00] P:1667.69 E:0.097159 |  after all of the talk about the way that he's played at the tournament,
[613.00 - 617.48] P:1741.13 E:0.097405 |  Thoden out there together as well, Bellingham too, back it goes towards the halfway line,
[617.48 - 623.40] P:1763.28 E:0.098511 |  still nail-nail, where it could easily have had an opening goal, Saka now just holds off the challenge,
[623.40 - 626.20] P:1731.32 E:0.103502 |  gives it back to Manu, Manu trying to find a way to...
[626.20 - 630.52] P:1764.46 E:0.103206 |  He does, Bellingham, now to Kain, Kain on the edge of the box, ball caught up underneath his feet,
[630.52 - 634.20] P:1666.35 E:0.096583 |  however he's been able to find Walker on the right-hand side, Walker with a cross,
[634.20 - 637.00] P:1721.87 E:0.093421 |  it's a deep one, should be headed away on the edge of the box actually,
[637.08 - 640.52] P:1583.30 E:0.093398 |  it's only headed out to Tripier, now back to Foden on the left-hand side,
[640.52 - 645.96] P:1719.53 E:0.092588 |  pass a little short to Tripier, he uses Rice, Rice 30 yards out, square to Manu,
[645.96 - 649.88] P:1712.90 E:0.107092 |  who's already looked a good choice, I must say, Kobi Manu despite the yellow card,
[649.88 - 653.48] P:1719.97 E:0.093791 |  Walker down the line to the byline, Saka catches up with that,
[653.48 - 657.08] P:1662.07 E:0.096854 |  Pocayo Saka in the white boots back to Walker, puts his foot on the ball,
[657.08 - 659.80] P:1645.87 E:0.102668 |  then infield out Manu, then Rice lifts it forward,
[659.80 - 663.72] P:1704.76 E:0.105013 |  but got badly underneath that and it just looked the way through for a goal,
[663.72 - 666.68] P:1758.87 E:0.101404 |  kicked us the back here, nail-nail, that passage of play for me is miles
[666.68 - 670.36] P:1747.14 E:0.091080 |  better, moving the ball, there's movement off the ball, which is the key,
[670.36 - 674.20] P:1632.11 E:0.092802 |  allows the passing to happen, but Manu does brilliantly a moment ago,
[674.20 - 678.84] P:1655.48 E:0.087203 |  just to toe the ball through into Kain, he couldn't quite get hold of it quick enough,
[678.84 - 681.88] P:1667.02 E:0.093492 |  and he had to shift it wide, it was a bit bubbly the pass to Karl Walker,
[681.88 - 685.16] P:1661.40 E:0.092530 |  but much better from England. Back down to behind the goal, is he?
[685.16 - 689.32] P:1515.78 E:0.104398 |  You can really feel the England fans behind as they were fizzing the ball around on that,
[689.32 - 692.68] P:1566.69 E:0.099460 |  that passage of play around the 18-yard box, they were crisp, they were sharp,
[692.68 - 694.68] P:1474.28 E:0.083616 |  exactly what I think everybody's wanted.
[694.68 - 697.56] P:1858.67 E:0.113159 |  Oh, that's a good ball to Haraslín down the left for Slovakia,
[697.56 - 701.32] P:1850.94 E:0.104655 |  Walker trying to get there, Haraslín, deflection cleared away,
[701.88 - 708.60] P:1653.02 E:0.099967 |  and somehow England survived, somehow, although it's won back, won back again by Duda,
[708.60 - 712.76] P:1791.58 E:0.106239 |  and that is giving us a free kick for the challenge on the Slovakia, number eight.
[713.32 - 717.72] P:1770.55 E:0.102022 |  Another massive let-off, brilliant play from Slovakia, what a pass,
[718.76 - 724.20] P:1787.65 E:0.094690 |  super pass, inside the fallback to Haraslín, gets the wrong side of Karl Walker,
[724.20 - 728.28] P:1727.92 E:0.089684 |  which you don't see that very often, just gets Karl Walker a little bit infield,
[728.28 - 732.28] P:1654.28 E:0.088084 |  not quite aware of where the player is, and it's a super block from Mark Eyre,
[732.28 - 735.40] P:1727.93 E:0.091631 |  he makes it all the way across from the left side centre-back,
[735.40 - 740.76] P:1746.71 E:0.090828 |  throws himself in front of the ball, it wasn't the most convincing of finishes from Haraslín,
[741.72 - 743.72] P:1569.88 E:0.098205 |  has to do better from that position, John, really.
[743.72 - 749.08] P:1713.23 E:0.083144 |  True, chaotic start from England, and actually, as Walker tried to recover
[749.08 - 753.08] P:1644.91 E:0.081066 |  and put in the challenge right on the edge of the area, I thought that could be a good chance.
[753.16 - 756.84] P:1609.98 E:0.091542 |  Could have given a penalty easily, and then there's a red card option as well.
[756.84 - 762.92] P:1645.56 E:0.090178 |  And a red card, England have survived that scare, England nil, Slovakia nil,
[762.92 - 766.12] P:1601.69 E:0.104203 |  Haraslín is going to take this, curls it in, that's powerfully headed away,
[766.84 - 769.80] P:1721.39 E:0.113507 |  by John Stones, comes out, England looking to bring it forward,
[769.80 - 774.36] P:1808.64 E:0.112465 |  look, that looked like a free kick it is, for the challenge on Kiran Trippier,
[774.36 - 781.72] P:1898.21 E:0.088592 |  as he was trying to take it away, and a yellow card now for Kutska.
[781.80 - 785.96] P:1659.17 E:0.093024 |  I think we can safely say that the referee doesn't mind a yellow, John.
[786.68 - 791.40] P:1595.54 E:0.080841 |  He's brandishing them out quite quickly in this game, I have to say.
[791.40 - 794.92] P:1625.20 E:0.099657 |  Which, in what's been quite a chaotic game, you know what that could mean?
[796.76 - 799.88] P:1582.88 E:0.095926 |  There's going to be a few, because obviously, Trippier's on a yellow card, isn't he?
[799.88 - 805.80] P:1471.44 E:0.087213 |  So all of a sudden, you could have to replace two of the back four,
[805.80 - 808.04] P:1745.70 E:0.094631 |  if Trippier picks up a booking in this game.
[808.04 - 809.48] P:1724.87 E:0.112206 |  Let's get a word from Chil Hart, Chil.
[810.20 - 815.64] P:1676.35 E:0.109530 |  Yeah, my jaw was slightly open there, seeing Carl Wolkham to chase one back,
[816.44 - 820.84] P:1595.20 E:0.110559 |  very unusual for him, but I thought it was some good recovery runs for Thordon,
[820.84 - 822.68] P:1728.01 E:0.109079 |  now John Finlay will take it over for him.
[822.68 - 824.20] P:1709.94 E:0.103562 |  For Thordon, down the left-hand side,
[824.20 - 826.76] P:1746.61 E:0.099613 |  Thordon's able to swing over the cross towards Sackett,
[826.76 - 830.44] P:1767.00 E:0.101765 |  but that's dealt with by Hans-Growe, who turns and puts it out of play,
[830.44 - 834.20] P:1710.72 E:0.094937 |  excellent pass from Trippier over the top, down the line for Thordon.
[834.84 - 839.24] P:1563.84 E:0.087062 |  It does feel, I have to say, that there are goals in this.
[839.24 - 841.24] P:1661.42 E:0.092681 |  Yes, 100%, which is good.
[842.36 - 847.64] P:1475.00 E:0.095528 |  The game has a different feel to it, John, and it isn't kind of slow-paced and dull,
[847.64 - 850.28] P:1589.09 E:0.098525 |  it's actually a really lively start to the game,
[850.28 - 855.64] P:1465.08 E:0.094184 |  maybe not for all the right reasons, but as a spectator, it's been enjoyable so far.
[855.64 - 857.72] P:1565.03 E:0.093421 |  And the other point to make, I don't think we've said, actually,
[857.72 - 859.56] P:1352.13 E:0.106163 |  it is quite cool here today.
[859.56 - 862.28] P:1432.48 E:0.102868 |  The heat has disappeared after all of the rain over the course,
[863.24 - 869.00] P:1607.37 E:0.092424 |  the weekend in the Ruhr Valley, stones, playing it across to Gay,
[869.80 - 873.48] P:1491.80 E:0.104927 |  now to the left-hand side to Trippier, and then infield towards Thordon,
[873.48 - 877.48] P:1684.14 E:0.110545 |  who's leaned into by Kutska, who's just picked up that yellow card,
[877.48 - 881.64] P:1643.84 E:0.092004 |  and I think he might have stepped on the ankle of Phil Thordon,
[881.64 - 883.56] P:1482.95 E:0.095102 |  a father again this week.
[884.04 - 885.72] P:1374.68 E:0.084579 |  Right, it's not foul.
[885.72 - 887.24] P:1652.64 E:0.093278 |  It's just strong, right? It's just strong.
[887.24 - 888.36] P:1601.53 E:0.108878 |  It's just a good tackle, Joe.
[888.36 - 891.64] P:1565.00 E:0.104410 |  Strong player that for me, I think the referee's getting way too involved.
[891.64 - 893.00] P:1454.86 E:0.072300 |  Yeah.
[893.80 - 896.60] P:1548.78 E:0.105927 |  Freak, they're taking an England, move it to the right-hand side,
[896.60 - 900.52] P:1560.82 E:0.093772 |  still 0-0 if you just joined us, five live in the World Service from the BBC,
[901.24 - 904.28] P:1562.54 E:0.091724 |  stones, halfway inside his own half.
[904.28 - 908.12] P:1661.79 E:0.102006 |  England have conceded so far just the one goal in the tournament,
[908.12 - 910.68] P:1695.24 E:0.099628 |  that excellent shot from Huleman against Denmark,
[910.68 - 914.36] P:1647.67 E:0.097593 |  but could easily have conceded here, could have conceded a couple of goals.
[914.36 - 918.36] P:1705.67 E:0.090210 |  Trippier, Trippier out there on the left, Gay,
[918.36 - 921.80] P:1628.28 E:0.097798 |  then picks out Kobe Nenu, who's been very involved, I must say,
[922.52 - 927.08] P:1681.74 E:0.088200 |  in the early stages, with 14, 15 minutes now on the clock.
[927.08 - 932.12] P:1809.77 E:0.095630 |  John Stone's winning his 76th cap tonight, across to Walker, his 87th.
[932.68 - 935.40] P:1915.33 E:0.103589 |  And then Walker and Stone's exchange passes again,
[935.40 - 939.88] P:1894.42 E:0.101692 |  the Manchester City pair, Declan Rice, then gets involved in England,
[939.88 - 943.64] P:1823.38 E:0.097654 |  are forced all the way back towards the edge of their own penalty area,
[943.64 - 946.20] P:1724.65 E:0.099730 |  and actually all the way back to goalkeeper Pickford.
[947.16 - 950.92] P:1663.41 E:0.099629 |  So they start again from in front of their own box, Trippier,
[950.92 - 953.96] P:1637.81 E:0.085561 |  Foden comes short, first-time pass from Foden.
[955.08 - 958.76] P:1598.69 E:0.099278 |  They've talked so much over the course of the last 24 hours
[958.76 - 961.80] P:1685.94 E:0.094887 |  about the fun that they've had this week, long pass from Stone's,
[961.80 - 964.20] P:1726.41 E:0.104355 |  I don't think Saka's got a chance of reaching that,
[964.20 - 967.96] P:1729.64 E:0.097697 |  he hasn't set a play for a throwing in their own left-back position,
[967.96 - 971.24] P:1563.82 E:0.082283 |  but they're opening few minutes,
[971.24 - 973.56] P:1561.37 E:0.090786 |  and some of the mistakes have been far from funny.
[973.80 - 975.40] P:1553.53 E:0.081864 |  Yeah, no, they haven't been funny.
[975.40 - 978.76] P:1589.01 E:0.093350 |  And also, Foden is being very central,
[978.76 - 981.48] P:1505.29 E:0.101233 |  he's not holding that width on the left-hand side at all.
[982.04 - 985.88] P:1728.98 E:0.119224 |  Haraslin or Bellingham in with a challenge, and that's a yellow card.
[985.88 - 988.76] P:1713.77 E:0.116826 |  I think Bellingham got the ball, but he's certainly got Haraslin as well,
[988.76 - 989.96] P:1520.76 E:0.108396 |  and now Jude Bellingham's booked,
[989.96 - 992.52] P:1639.09 E:0.101808 |  and that's three England players in the referee's book.
[992.52 - 995.56] P:1642.21 E:0.097614 |  Well, I'm not too sure if it is a yellow card,
[995.56 - 996.68] P:1585.20 E:0.104023 |  I mean, great to see the replay.
[996.68 - 999.96] P:1628.87 E:0.106270 |  My initial feeling was he wins the ball, and he's remonstrating with the referee,
[999.96 - 1004.28] P:1592.75 E:0.095359 |  is really saying, I won the ball, which I think he did clip the ball,
[1004.28 - 1006.60] P:1547.12 E:0.095610 |  but then he took a big chunk of Haraslin,
[1007.40 - 1011.08] P:1540.52 E:0.097142 |  I think he gets a toe on the ball, which for me is a clean tackle.
[1011.08 - 1012.52] P:1434.17 E:0.111576 |  I think it's a clean tackle, I agree with you,
[1012.52 - 1015.72] P:1448.71 E:0.109828 |  but with the way we've just seen how this game's being refereed here,
[1016.44 - 1018.36] P:1606.83 E:0.105485 |  and I immediately thought he's going to book him.
[1018.36 - 1021.48] P:1560.28 E:0.111940 |  So as much as it isn't a booking, in this game it is,
[1021.48 - 1022.76] P:1484.77 E:0.103697 |  and this is the game that we're playing,
[1022.76 - 1024.68] P:1396.50 E:0.112758 |  so I think we need to be really aware of that,
[1024.68 - 1026.76] P:1726.75 E:0.088771 |  and that message needs to be getting onto the pitch.
[1026.76 - 1029.24] P:1602.22 E:0.101622 |  It doesn't matter what you think, this referee's in charge,
[1029.32 - 1030.76] P:1633.78 E:0.097369 |  and if he wants to make a decision, he will.
[1032.60 - 1038.28] P:1565.74 E:0.089308 |  England, nil, Slovakia, nil, far from plain sailing against Slovakia,
[1039.16 - 1041.24] P:1599.17 E:0.094786 |  who've never reached a quarter-final,
[1041.24 - 1043.64] P:1698.75 E:0.097390 |  but have made a strong positive start in the match here,
[1043.64 - 1046.20] P:1704.81 E:0.101595 |  Saka, but Saka loses out centrally,
[1046.20 - 1050.44] P:1537.51 E:0.099501 |  and now it is Lobotka of Napoli,
[1050.44 - 1054.52] P:1600.21 E:0.103464 |  who just recycles it from in front of the centre-circle.
[1054.52 - 1055.64] P:1106.63 E:0.089076 |  He's a player.
[1055.64 - 1056.76] P:1516.20 E:0.104412 |  Good player, really good player.
[1056.76 - 1057.64] P:1316.79 E:0.116105 |  He is a player.
[1057.64 - 1060.04] P:1353.95 E:0.109340 |  It's brilliant at winning the ball back,
[1060.04 - 1061.88] P:1563.77 E:0.095564 |  but the speed in which he distributes,
[1061.88 - 1064.20] P:1504.98 E:0.106885 |  he's got the picture of where he's going before he has it,
[1064.20 - 1067.00] P:1572.69 E:0.110685 |  and he just pops it around, really low centre of gravity,
[1067.64 - 1068.76] P:1354.94 E:0.123677 |  looking like a top player.
[1069.88 - 1073.48] P:1526.17 E:0.105547 |  Napoli man, Slovakia's most expensive footballer.
[1073.48 - 1074.84] P:1735.64 E:0.090017 |  He's caught the eye.
[1074.84 - 1078.12] P:1531.19 E:0.102926 |  He's certainly a contender for one of the players of the tournament
[1078.12 - 1079.16] P:1651.86 E:0.091937 |  in that position.
[1079.16 - 1081.00] P:1591.90 E:0.089211 |  England, nil, Slovakia, nil.
[1081.00 - 1083.88] P:1575.47 E:0.099708 |  Now here is the captain, Skriniar of Paris Saint-Germain,
[1084.68 - 1088.04] P:1619.84 E:0.100915 |  but Walker's able to get the right side of Hans Gull.
[1088.84 - 1089.96] P:1744.29 E:0.113120 |  I mean, they get high up the picture.
[1089.96 - 1091.16] P:1801.96 E:0.093075 |  That's the left back job.
[1091.16 - 1095.00] P:1745.46 E:0.103885 |  He's looking to get in behind Karl Walker on this side a lot of the time,
[1095.00 - 1097.64] P:1590.14 E:0.103165 |  and also Harris-Lynne will then come a bit narrower or deeper.
[1097.64 - 1101.48] P:1641.95 E:0.087606 |  They've got a nice build-up happening on the left-hand side for Slovakia.
[1101.48 - 1105.16] P:1707.24 E:0.091946 |  Yeah, Hans Gull, that's the left back who's been playing for Arnie Slott
[1105.16 - 1106.44] P:1735.47 E:0.099128 |  at Feyenoord this season,
[1106.44 - 1110.12] P:1615.48 E:0.091753 |  and there is a bit of talk that he may end up at Liverpool with him.
[1110.12 - 1111.40] P:1498.90 E:0.079258 |  We'll see about that.
[1111.40 - 1114.04] P:1533.41 E:0.096550 |  But England, 15 yards inside their own half.
[1115.80 - 1119.96] P:1599.18 E:0.098434 |  Stones onto his right foot, then back to Walker again,
[1120.76 - 1122.28] P:1516.03 E:0.111394 |  Bellingham make himself available,
[1122.28 - 1125.64] P:1604.72 E:0.099344 |  but instead the passes go to Saka on the right-hand side.
[1125.64 - 1129.48] P:1536.20 E:0.094713 |  Bukajosaka has looked a potential danger man for England in this match.
[1130.28 - 1133.72] P:1526.39 E:0.097154 |  Back to Maynou, and Declan Rice just holds off the challenge from him,
[1133.72 - 1137.16] P:1542.88 E:0.098674 |  and England go back to stationary ball again.
[1137.16 - 1139.08] P:1613.67 E:0.089763 |  Walker, then long pass from him.
[1139.16 - 1143.00] P:1592.25 E:0.101548 |  Trippier pushing up the left-hand side, puts in the challenge on Peckeryk.
[1143.00 - 1146.52] P:1640.12 E:0.095892 |  The oldest man in the squad, the 37-year-old Peckeryk,
[1146.52 - 1148.68] P:1515.88 E:0.096267 |  thrown taken by Trippier back to Rice.
[1148.68 - 1152.28] P:1457.49 E:0.095643 |  He has Maynou, Maynou then just keeps the ball,
[1153.48 - 1157.32] P:1674.57 E:0.104412 |  rolls it out here to Saka, Saka running up against Hans Gull.
[1158.20 - 1160.76] P:1772.09 E:0.104774 |  Still Saka in possession of the ball, goes in field,
[1160.76 - 1162.68] P:1668.90 E:0.094772 |  on his left foot again, cutting in field,
[1162.68 - 1164.92] P:1611.01 E:0.095739 |  square from him to his Arsenal teammate, Rice.
[1164.92 - 1166.76] P:1543.52 E:0.105298 |  Now back to Foden on the edge of the penalty area,
[1166.76 - 1168.20] P:1584.70 E:0.088799 |  over towards the left-hand side.
[1168.20 - 1170.84] P:1604.91 E:0.095936 |  Trippier back to Rice, and Maynou wants it.
[1170.84 - 1174.20] P:1743.80 E:0.095702 |  No, instead the ball into the area onto the head of Skriniar,
[1174.20 - 1175.40] P:1528.18 E:0.108675 |  who's able to head it away.
[1175.40 - 1177.88] P:1526.75 E:0.098310 |  That was a proper get-out header, wasn't it?
[1177.88 - 1181.16] P:1583.55 E:0.099066 |  I mean, he puts so much neck power into that clearance, Skriniar.
[1181.16 - 1182.68] P:1476.15 E:0.100355 |  He's no nonsense centre-back.
[1182.68 - 1185.32] P:1710.84 E:0.107096 |  Stones has given it away to Stralatz now.
[1185.32 - 1187.48] P:1738.23 E:0.106094 |  This is dangerous. Slavakir on the attack.
[1187.48 - 1190.28] P:1826.89 E:0.109134 |  All Rice goes in with a challenge there that he had to make.
[1190.28 - 1191.56] P:1844.64 E:0.107243 |  He had to time that well,
[1191.56 - 1194.76] P:1711.00 E:0.100345 |  particularly with the yellow cards we've seen, but he timed it perfectly.
[1194.76 - 1196.76] P:1511.76 E:0.103901 |  Cracking tackle from Declan Rice.
[1196.84 - 1198.60] P:1687.19 E:0.119086 |  He saw the opportunity.
[1198.60 - 1203.80] P:1872.70 E:0.108733 |  It was forceful, and he took a massive chunk of Kutskup at the same time.
[1203.80 - 1208.20] P:1700.54 E:0.095929 |  It's actually the perfect opportunity to win the ball
[1208.20 - 1209.64] P:1441.24 E:0.085129 |  and lead a bit on someone's own.
[1209.64 - 1211.24] P:1527.80 E:0.101118 |  Yeah, put down a marker.
[1211.24 - 1212.44] P:1837.30 E:0.084650 |  Yeah, yeah.
[1212.44 - 1215.32] P:1746.71 E:0.103174 |  And obviously with the way the game's been going, it was risky,
[1215.32 - 1217.16] P:1662.94 E:0.109802 |  but he nailed it. He absolutely nailed it.
[1217.16 - 1220.20] P:1663.66 E:0.099300 |  Let's hope that's going to get us a little foothold in the game again.
[1220.20 - 1224.68] P:1650.92 E:0.103725 |  Still nail-nail, but not a comfortable watch for England supporters.
[1224.76 - 1228.36] P:1550.86 E:0.110831 |  Wherever they are, either here in Gelsenkirchen in the stands,
[1229.08 - 1232.84] P:1622.68 E:0.103507 |  where there are massed ranks of white and red shirts,
[1232.84 - 1235.72] P:1427.15 E:0.106937 |  whether at home in the UK or around the world,
[1236.28 - 1237.96] P:1649.52 E:0.103139 |  listening to us on the World Service.
[1239.00 - 1241.32] P:1509.82 E:0.103340 |  Fortunate that it is still nail-nail.
[1242.44 - 1245.16] P:1142.65 E:0.112343 |  Menu. Now to Tripier.
[1246.84 - 1250.68] P:1419.54 E:0.114770 |  Phil Folder just comes back into his own half, then back to Tripier again.
[1251.64 - 1252.92] P:1308.89 E:0.121416 |  Mark Gay.
[1252.92 - 1255.24] P:1393.66 E:0.115107 |  We will have that conversation about who might come in
[1255.24 - 1256.28] P:1557.02 E:0.112640 |  if we get a chance match.
[1256.28 - 1257.56] P:1555.89 E:0.105672 |  So, what are you thinking, Capon?
[1258.68 - 1260.20] P:1580.36 E:0.110495 |  Stones back to Gay.
[1261.32 - 1263.56] P:1579.59 E:0.115231 |  And I think there's a lot of water to pass under the bridge
[1263.56 - 1266.60] P:1465.38 E:0.101734 |  before we start talking about an England quarterfinal,
[1266.60 - 1270.04] P:1576.50 E:0.105746 |  the way that this match has started over the first now, 20 minutes.
[1270.04 - 1271.64] P:1400.20 E:0.100984 |  I mean, it could go anywhere this game, Joe.
[1271.64 - 1273.40] P:1537.45 E:0.099381 |  It has that feel to it.
[1273.40 - 1277.48] P:1446.88 E:0.102539 |  It's entertaining to watch, but not entertaining, if you know what I mean.
[1277.48 - 1279.64] P:1622.50 E:0.100902 |  And then Saka loses out.
[1279.72 - 1282.04] P:1629.58 E:0.093081 |  Hanskull puts in the challenge, so Slovakia off.
[1282.04 - 1284.20] P:1614.44 E:0.108690 |  Another attack, there's a ball in field from Walker.
[1284.20 - 1285.48] P:1582.28 E:0.095777 |  That could have gone anywhere.
[1285.48 - 1287.32] P:1667.89 E:0.099973 |  That could have set Strelitz away.
[1287.32 - 1290.60] P:1542.64 E:0.109357 |  And John Stones was very fortunate that the ball deflected off him.
[1290.60 - 1293.08] P:1576.37 E:0.104413 |  But now England attack with Tripier on the left-hand side.
[1294.04 - 1295.32] P:1580.04 E:0.101039 |  Just the feel of this game.
[1295.32 - 1297.56] P:1500.60 E:0.103485 |  There must be a goal coming sooner or later.
[1297.56 - 1300.28] P:1460.85 E:0.102267 |  At that moment there, John, we've got an overload on the left-hand side.
[1300.28 - 1302.28] P:1487.98 E:0.100376 |  But Tripier comes straight inside.
[1302.28 - 1305.16] P:1403.58 E:0.102990 |  Not once have we got at the oldest player on the pitch.
[1305.16 - 1307.08] P:1403.60 E:0.096469 |  Pecker at the right-backs, 37,
[1307.16 - 1310.04] P:1337.35 E:0.095713 |  plays in the second division in Germany, doesn't he?
[1310.04 - 1313.00] P:1300.59 E:0.093115 |  And no one's isolated him, 1v1.
[1313.00 - 1316.92] P:1399.97 E:0.095315 |  No one's got at him on our left-hand side, their right-hand side at all.
[1316.92 - 1319.00] P:1266.95 E:0.096322 |  It's really surprised me in the opening 20 minutes.
[1319.00 - 1322.60] P:1247.98 E:0.112353 |  Yeah, place for Hertha in the capital in Berlin,
[1322.60 - 1324.60] P:1252.12 E:0.106465 |  England back on the halfway line.
[1324.60 - 1327.80] P:1507.93 E:0.108685 |  And then Tripier, he has one for Foulden to chase down the right-hand side.
[1327.80 - 1331.80] P:1557.52 E:0.105730 |  And actually, Fabro, the centre of the fender, comes across and takes the ball away from Foulden.
[1331.80 - 1336.52] P:1588.53 E:0.100623 |  As clean as a whistle, the Slovakia fans, the Falkens, will have enjoyed that.
[1336.52 - 1339.16] P:1791.63 E:0.109214 |  Now Rice wins it back. He has Ballingham on the edge of the area.
[1339.16 - 1342.60] P:1709.32 E:0.107918 |  Ballingham trying to find the position, left side of the box, back to Foulden.
[1342.60 - 1345.00] P:1739.56 E:0.115974 |  Foulden goes down, big shout for Penalty.
[1345.00 - 1346.04] P:1722.05 E:0.111296 |  I'm not sure.
[1346.04 - 1348.52] P:1650.01 E:0.108929 |  Ballingham, though, his cross, that's blocked by the defender.
[1348.52 - 1351.64] P:1660.26 E:0.101972 |  Comes out to Tripier, right-footed ball in from him.
[1351.64 - 1354.84] P:1615.57 E:0.112294 |  Kane with a header wide, came off the defender, it's a corner.
[1355.80 - 1358.68] P:1776.61 E:0.111056 |  This game is really edgy.
[1358.68 - 1360.76] P:1675.76 E:0.111225 |  I mean, it's happening at both ends.
[1360.76 - 1364.44] P:1561.10 E:0.101926 |  Declan Rice, brilliant interception, wraps the ball into Drew Ballingham.
[1364.44 - 1366.92] P:1563.35 E:0.108701 |  He gets past Scrinia, who has a real lunge for the talent,
[1366.92 - 1370.12] P:1492.36 E:0.102434 |  and then he just tickles the ball back into the penalty spot.
[1370.12 - 1372.92] P:1568.78 E:0.105243 |  And it's a wild clearance by Slovakia.
[1372.92 - 1374.76] P:1496.52 E:0.104064 |  It's a little bit messy from then.
[1374.76 - 1376.28] P:1428.91 E:0.117483 |  I mean, the tackle goes in on Foulden.
[1376.28 - 1377.80] P:1548.37 E:0.107921 |  It's a real melee.
[1377.80 - 1379.48] P:1695.76 E:0.111950 |  There's a lot going on inside that box.
[1380.76 - 1385.72] P:1687.17 E:0.100912 |  Came off the defender, Kane's header into the top of his shoulder.
[1385.72 - 1387.40] P:1665.71 E:0.109165 |  So corner from the right-hand side.
[1388.28 - 1394.12] P:1690.71 E:0.098151 |  The first quarter of the match is through, and somehow, both sides still.
[1394.76 - 1395.80] P:1514.84 E:0.107945 |  Yet to break through.
[1396.68 - 1401.72] P:1624.74 E:0.090043 |  Tripier with the corner from the right, takes it back towards Saka.
[1401.72 - 1403.96] P:1659.99 E:0.106690 |  Left-footed ball in from Saka, came off the header.
[1403.96 - 1406.60] P:1815.79 E:0.094577 |  The defender hasn't cleared its stone, stretching for it.
[1406.60 - 1410.68] P:1668.26 E:0.101286 |  Comes out, Mino goes for the volley, but it wouldn't hit.
[1410.68 - 1414.36] P:1785.66 E:0.110815 |  Hit it beautifully, but it flew away over the top left corner by a yard or more.
[1414.36 - 1416.28] P:1691.57 E:0.101947 |  That's a perfect trajectory, wasn't it?
[1416.28 - 1418.44] P:1816.64 E:0.101198 |  I'm looking at his facial expression as he jogs away,
[1418.44 - 1419.48] P:1737.91 E:0.110414 |  and he's a tough chance.
[1420.12 - 1424.04] P:1751.06 E:0.103740 |  Ball falling out of the sky, but he's got the quality to hit the target now.
[1424.04 - 1425.32] P:1667.13 E:0.103041 |  I think he's disappointed, actually.
[1425.32 - 1428.60] P:1651.23 E:0.084630 |  He's got that ability to dip and swerve the ball.
[1428.60 - 1429.48] P:1590.63 E:0.089814 |  It was a lovely effort.
[1430.36 - 1431.56] P:1626.29 E:0.090596 |  Time that beautifully.
[1431.56 - 1432.84] P:1700.76 E:0.119414 |  You know, a couple of yards lower.
[1432.84 - 1434.20] P:1722.75 E:0.090366 |  That's an unstoppable shot.
[1434.20 - 1437.24] P:1684.10 E:0.110839 |  But, yeah, that was a good couple of minutes from in there.
[1437.24 - 1440.20] P:1711.30 E:0.099928 |  Bravka slightly caught in two mines as well with the corner.
[1440.20 - 1441.32] P:1626.90 E:0.098116 |  I wanted to see Tripier put it in,
[1441.32 - 1443.48] P:1715.53 E:0.096936 |  but I thought it was a good ball in from Saka as well.
[1443.48 - 1445.08] P:1829.27 E:0.108771 |  Ball played forward by Duda.
[1445.08 - 1448.12] P:1634.63 E:0.099466 |  Here is Haraslina again, the number 17 walker,
[1448.76 - 1452.44] P:1312.94 E:0.105091 |  threatened to step in there on the challenge, back to hands go,
[1452.44 - 1453.32] P:1345.34 E:0.111351 |  then down the line.
[1453.40 - 1456.76] P:1376.22 E:0.104019 |  Bakia goes to the halfway line to Lobotka,
[1456.76 - 1459.48] P:1494.51 E:0.102408 |  and then through the middle England, back in position.
[1459.48 - 1462.28] P:1271.85 E:0.110194 |  But Slavakia just popping the ball around England.
[1462.92 - 1467.64] P:1717.55 E:0.097688 |  As Lobotka draws, Bellingham plays it in field towards Duda,
[1467.64 - 1469.24] P:1654.03 E:0.099833 |  and they go back into their own half.
[1469.24 - 1469.72] P:1861.92 E:0.100182 |  Confident.
[1470.28 - 1473.40] P:1767.98 E:0.109167 |  Well, they have turned up here feeling like they can beat England today.
[1473.40 - 1475.96] P:1720.52 E:0.109889 |  You can tell by their body language, the way they're chasing the ball.
[1475.96 - 1478.20] P:1758.08 E:0.110364 |  Strelitz now on the edge of the area, trying to get it down.
[1478.20 - 1479.88] P:1648.15 E:0.115407 |  It wouldn't bounce forward and played into the box.
[1479.88 - 1481.08] P:1846.70 E:0.110344 |  Now the chance under goal!
[1482.04 - 1482.60] P:1816.93 E:0.095422 |  Stranc!
[1486.04 - 1487.88] P:1666.95 E:0.116804 |  With a right foot from the angle,
[1488.68 - 1491.40] P:1547.10 E:0.117029 |  and it is Slavakia who opened the scoring.
[1493.00 - 1494.04] P:1596.15 E:0.121416 |  And they deserve it.
[1494.68 - 1496.76] P:1517.94 E:0.115028 |  A super start to the match from them.
[1497.56 - 1499.16] P:1649.25 E:0.123254 |  24 minutes on the clock.
[1500.20 - 1502.68] P:1604.52 E:0.128433 |  He scores his third goal of these Euros.
[1504.04 - 1506.04] P:1602.04 E:0.124508 |  And it's England, Nils Slavakia won.
[1506.92 - 1510.52] P:1468.19 E:0.125523 |  Well, this is massive, massive pressure for England now.
[1511.08 - 1513.48] P:1552.49 E:0.118255 |  What a start to the game from Slavakia.
[1513.48 - 1516.92] P:1521.11 E:0.119752 |  When I'm looking down, John, I don't think Mark Gehrig, was it Kobe Mainu?
[1516.92 - 1518.44] P:1430.01 E:0.117828 |  Oh, it's Gehrig down in the box.
[1519.16 - 1522.36] P:1538.14 E:0.125394 |  Whoever the recovering player was, it's Gehrig, isn't it?
[1522.36 - 1525.72] P:1477.92 E:0.117572 |  It was recovering, and he's caught the heel.
[1525.72 - 1527.48] P:1445.69 E:0.111897 |  I mean, it's a lovely goal from Slavakia,
[1528.12 - 1530.04] P:1482.85 E:0.125629 |  but he's caught the heel of one of the players,
[1530.04 - 1532.44] P:1468.38 E:0.118818 |  and he's not really getting back up onto his feet.
[1532.92 - 1534.68] P:1454.21 E:0.109407 |  I mean, it's super football,
[1534.68 - 1537.72] P:1541.65 E:0.112090 |  but there's so much time and space on the ball that they have, John,
[1537.72 - 1542.36] P:1640.94 E:0.098183 |  to find the right pass, lovely run into the box from Schrantz,
[1542.36 - 1544.84] P:1670.22 E:0.100556 |  who gets found by his teammate, he gets his head up,
[1544.84 - 1547.32] P:1612.10 E:0.097633 |  Pickford's coming out, and he just flicks the ball,
[1547.32 - 1549.96] P:1637.56 E:0.098775 |  with the outside of his right boot, slot it into the corner,
[1550.52 - 1553.48] P:1629.24 E:0.103810 |  and Mark Gehrig receiving treatment in the six-yard box.
[1553.48 - 1554.52] P:1746.20 E:0.102438 |  Yeah, this is...
[1555.64 - 1558.12] P:1699.90 E:0.103454 |  This could be a problem for Mark Gehrig.
[1558.12 - 1560.20] P:1791.43 E:0.107148 |  Let's go down behind the goal to Ersy Christensen.
[1562.20 - 1565.24] P:1659.53 E:0.112140 |  Taking my eyes off the pitch, and just looking at all the England fans behind me.
[1566.20 - 1569.96] P:1632.61 E:0.104430 |  Every single one of them has exactly the same facial expression.
[1569.96 - 1573.56] P:1755.24 E:0.106823 |  They're all in shock, and we have the luxury here of looking up at the big screen,
[1573.56 - 1575.88] P:1791.99 E:0.094180 |  and I know you guys have it on your side as well.
[1575.88 - 1578.20] P:1733.66 E:0.096512 |  But as the replay was being shown on the big screen,
[1578.20 - 1581.00] P:1706.38 E:0.095646 |  all the fans were starting to point, going,
[1581.00 - 1582.92] P:1844.24 E:0.109410 |  who's tracking that runner, who's doing that,
[1582.92 - 1584.52] P:1682.83 E:0.099484 |  and they're all really frustrated.
[1585.48 - 1587.72] P:1727.59 E:0.110625 |  Big goal for Slavakia, though. What a finish, I must say.
[1589.16 - 1591.64] P:1677.42 E:0.110052 |  I think Mark Gehrig is going to be OK,
[1591.64 - 1594.68] P:1627.87 E:0.101948 |  look, he's feeling his collarbone, his neck.
[1595.40 - 1598.12] P:1639.57 E:0.104901 |  It's hard to see where he is. I think it's with the challenge.
[1598.68 - 1602.68] P:1658.00 E:0.098490 |  There's an initial challenge in the air that he loses out on,
[1603.48 - 1605.00] P:1703.36 E:0.103477 |  and it has been that kind of start.
[1605.00 - 1607.88] P:1665.10 E:0.096557 |  I have to say, Slavakia had started brilliantly,
[1607.88 - 1610.04] P:1729.46 E:0.096796 |  and he's caught his shoulder, or popped his shoulder,
[1610.04 - 1611.88] P:1683.17 E:0.098572 |  or collarbone, or something in that challenge.
[1611.88 - 1613.48] P:1686.15 E:0.102699 |  It's a heavily strapped there, I can see that.
[1613.48 - 1617.48] P:1635.00 E:0.110657 |  So it's obviously an existing injury, so as much as it wasn't a huge impact,
[1617.48 - 1619.48] P:1691.70 E:0.100799 |  that's probably something that he's just been struggling with,
[1619.48 - 1621.88] P:1689.87 E:0.097437 |  so maybe just that knot, when you're not expecting it,
[1621.88 - 1623.72] P:1740.01 E:0.105773 |  it just throws you a little bit.
[1624.84 - 1628.76] P:1739.63 E:0.098581 |  England-nil, Slavakia won, and the shock is on.
[1629.40 - 1632.60] P:1672.40 E:0.100265 |  Would it be a shock the way that the match has been played?
[1632.60 - 1635.16] P:1560.74 E:0.089271 |  That's a good question. Given the form,
[1635.96 - 1637.48] P:1636.19 E:0.096703 |  and how Slavakia have started this game,
[1637.48 - 1639.56] P:1545.03 E:0.103236 |  they've got belief this team, they really have.
[1639.56 - 1642.20] P:1585.22 E:0.099230 |  They firmly believe they're good enough to beat England today,
[1642.20 - 1645.08] P:1529.92 E:0.091945 |  and so far the evidence would say that they can.
[1645.08 - 1647.56] P:1492.95 E:0.100804 |  Yeah, they've already beaten Belgium at the tournament,
[1647.56 - 1650.04] P:1689.54 E:0.097835 |  Schranz scored the goal there in that match,
[1650.04 - 1652.92] P:1507.65 E:0.094491 |  and they were able to see that out for a 1-nil win.
[1652.92 - 1657.24] P:1684.03 E:0.098986 |  Now Schranz, who has become the joint-leading scorer at the tournament,
[1657.24 - 1659.08] P:1753.75 E:0.093097 |  scored in three of the four matches now.
[1659.08 - 1660.84] P:1818.10 E:0.098918 |  It's a cute finish as well, wasn't it?
[1660.84 - 1663.96] P:1610.95 E:0.085103 |  Composed from the right-sided midfielder.
[1663.96 - 1667.16] P:1500.63 E:0.092630 |  That was a cracking goal. Super composure, lovely run.
[1667.80 - 1671.16] P:1480.33 E:0.102454 |  And the past, the trouble is, we lose that initial header,
[1671.16 - 1673.24] P:1247.72 E:0.101839 |  the ball drops down into the second ball phase,
[1673.24 - 1674.76] P:1273.18 E:0.096160 |  and the distance is massive.
[1674.76 - 1677.00] P:1380.91 E:0.102746 |  There's so much time for the midfield player.
[1677.00 - 1679.00] P:1578.15 E:0.102779 |  I think it might have been Kutsko, actually,
[1679.00 - 1682.68] P:1486.62 E:0.095315 |  who had the ball, who slid it through behind the back four,
[1682.76 - 1685.64] P:1654.37 E:0.099545 |  the run from Schranz was perfect, but there was so much time, John.
[1685.64 - 1688.12] P:1373.68 E:0.101283 |  I mean, it was pretty comfortable for them.
[1688.12 - 1692.20] P:1660.60 E:0.101657 |  And it's been a big problem with England's in the Euros in this tournament,
[1692.20 - 1694.76] P:1724.61 E:0.105302 |  which just haven't got tight enough or close enough to the opposition
[1694.76 - 1698.04] P:1733.46 E:0.110846 |  to stop them playing, and Slovakia will take full advantage of it.
[1698.76 - 1701.96] P:1748.50 E:0.112884 |  So England now behind for the first time at the Euros.
[1702.84 - 1705.32] P:1686.92 E:0.106788 |  They've got the ball inside their own half.
[1705.32 - 1707.00] P:1777.54 E:0.095226 |  Pickford comes out of his penalty area,
[1707.00 - 1709.88] P:1709.80 E:0.098532 |  and actually urges Stones to go forward.
[1709.88 - 1712.28] P:1695.38 E:0.090677 |  Rice does exactly that, gives it to Tripier.
[1712.36 - 1714.52] P:1618.29 E:0.107731 |  The England players as well, as he was talking about,
[1714.52 - 1716.44] P:1626.27 E:0.086232 |  the fans looking up at the big screen,
[1716.44 - 1720.04] P:1660.15 E:0.099887 |  that's a sort of four-sided cube that hangs above the centre-circle here.
[1720.04 - 1721.96] P:1589.60 E:0.102438 |  The England players were doing that as well,
[1722.52 - 1724.84] P:1521.11 E:0.104982 |  when Gay was receiving treatment.
[1724.84 - 1727.64] P:1584.88 E:0.101944 |  He is back on the field, incidentally, Mark Gay.
[1727.64 - 1731.32] P:1625.02 E:0.108492 |  So the England players as well, keen to see it again.
[1732.44 - 1738.04] P:1466.36 E:0.103898 |  Ivan Schranz's goal in the 25th minute to put Slovakia one nil up.
[1738.04 - 1741.96] P:1505.44 E:0.104613 |  Slovakia have never beaten England since the break-up of the
[1742.44 - 1744.04] P:1618.07 E:0.095071 |  former Czechoslovakia.
[1744.04 - 1746.68] P:1452.34 E:0.105572 |  He has Rice, Rice out to the left-hand side.
[1747.64 - 1751.40] P:1541.28 E:0.106452 |  Tripier. Tripier just gives it back towards the halfway line.
[1751.40 - 1754.44] P:1533.87 E:0.102396 |  If you remember the last match before Gareth Southgate took over,
[1754.44 - 1756.84] P:1601.50 E:0.083001 |  was against Slovakia.
[1756.84 - 1761.88] P:1488.68 E:0.100331 |  Sam Aladais' only match when they won right at the end in Trinabar,
[1762.44 - 1766.76] P:1535.92 E:0.107851 |  with a goal from Adam Lallana, as Hanskor again comes forward.
[1767.56 - 1771.08] P:1418.76 E:0.099155 |  Bellingham. Bellingham, nice change of feet from him,
[1771.08 - 1776.28] P:1596.31 E:0.099051 |  moves infield into the centre-circle, turns back, passes it right for it to Saka,
[1776.28 - 1777.56] P:1691.53 E:0.104521 |  who takes that down again.
[1777.56 - 1781.96] P:1657.79 E:0.104561 |  Lovely control from him in the challenge from Haraslin,
[1781.96 - 1785.40] P:1671.20 E:0.101508 |  which is deflected out of play for a throw in to England.
[1786.04 - 1789.32] P:1310.82 E:0.098525 |  Saka takes this back to Walker.
[1789.32 - 1794.52] P:1342.04 E:0.099768 |  So right now with this scoreline, we're looking at a quarter-final of Switzerland,
[1794.52 - 1796.76] P:1439.24 E:0.109667 |  Slovenia, and England will be going out.
[1797.64 - 1799.80] P:1392.70 E:0.106652 |  Bellingham passes it to Tripier.
[1799.88 - 1804.68] P:1609.27 E:0.099626 |  Tripier then infield to Foden, Foden controlled it, tried to stab it forward to Harry Kane,
[1804.68 - 1808.12] P:1474.39 E:0.101173 |  Kane chasing down into the full-back position.
[1808.12 - 1811.72] P:1603.26 E:0.101970 |  Slovakia get it away where it's headed away by Kutska,
[1811.72 - 1815.64] P:1588.87 E:0.098869 |  then Duda's battling for it in there, and an excellent midfield three.
[1815.64 - 1817.96] P:1689.13 E:0.116870 |  Duda, Lobotka and Kutska, they know their jobs.
[1817.96 - 1822.04] P:1483.13 E:0.107846 |  I'll tell you what, there, midfield three has been exceptional in this opening half an hour.
[1822.04 - 1825.80] P:1314.44 E:0.100446 |  Lobotka is everywhere with and without the ball, anticipation.
[1825.80 - 1829.08] P:1432.24 E:0.100757 |  I mean, he's intercepted there, he comes across, he's reading the play.
[1829.08 - 1832.36] P:1476.79 E:0.107221 |  The ball's coming in, I think it was either Foden maybe had come inside,
[1832.36 - 1837.00] P:1294.66 E:0.102309 |  he just steps in, puts the pressure, nudges the play, gets a toe on the ball, wins it back.
[1837.00 - 1839.32] P:1549.69 E:0.104720 |  Little subtle things like that all the time.
[1839.32 - 1841.80] P:1561.77 E:0.104226 |  He is really playing out of his skin.
[1841.80 - 1845.40] P:1779.68 E:0.104851 |  Harry Kane putting pressure on Dubravka of Newcastle,
[1845.40 - 1849.16] P:1603.04 E:0.099348 |  the goalkeeper who passes it out for a throw into England on the far side.
[1849.16 - 1851.24] P:1556.88 E:0.091029 |  So there's applause for Harry Kane for that.
[1851.24 - 1854.04] P:1501.83 E:0.098908 |  Half an hour played, England one nil down,
[1855.24 - 1857.48] P:1368.48 E:0.100349 |  and Slovakia doing their thing again.
[1858.20 - 1864.36] P:1377.28 E:0.101778 |  They were in that very tight group, Ukraine and Romania and Belgium, lost to Ukraine,
[1864.92 - 1871.88] P:1425.70 E:0.102355 |  drew with Romania, and here they are now in position where they could reach a quarter final
[1871.88 - 1876.76] P:1648.35 E:0.115585 |  for the first time as Slovakia gave back to the halfway line.
[1878.44 - 1884.12] P:1786.04 E:0.105359 |  And then Dalingham in a deeper lying position, it's passed out to the right-hand side to Saka.
[1884.12 - 1890.12] P:1574.90 E:0.097342 |  Now Jude Dalingham again, right is available, Dalingham drags it back, uses Manu,
[1891.08 - 1895.56] P:1635.40 E:0.111289 |  then Dalingham, that's a lovely ball to Saka, Saka now against Skriniar in the box,
[1895.56 - 1899.40] P:1686.73 E:0.104528 |  right foot across, that's beyond Foden at the back post who has to scamper out,
[1899.40 - 1902.92] P:1659.30 E:0.106977 |  it's kept in very well by Trippia, Foden then takes it up,
[1902.92 - 1906.20] P:1623.84 E:0.106874 |  here's Harry Kane left side of the box, Kane curls it into the back post,
[1906.20 - 1910.28] P:1740.25 E:0.103493 |  but that's over the jump of Saka and all the way through for Golke.
[1910.36 - 1917.88] P:1764.70 E:0.103556 |  We can only come inside the pitch when the ball is on the left-hand side, I mean it's been a problem
[1917.88 - 1922.60] P:1686.44 E:0.099859 |  for me for a while but in this match it's so glaring, you want to get at the right back,
[1922.60 - 1928.20] P:1694.22 E:0.087080 |  you want to isolate him 1v1, there's never, it's never on to play wide, there's no whip
[1928.20 - 1932.52] P:1893.29 E:0.100410 |  stretching the pitch on that side, you're almost playing with just one flank available,
[1932.52 - 1935.72] P:1733.95 E:0.100310 |  which is the right-hand side with Saka who does like to stay out here but
[1936.20 - 1940.36] P:1536.12 E:0.092209 |  it's just coming inside every time off our left-hand side and it's just making the pitch
[1940.36 - 1948.28] P:1604.18 E:0.087134 |  so much smaller. The score here in Gelsenkirchen, England 0, Slovakia 1, the Lobotka,
[1948.84 - 1955.32] P:1593.32 E:0.099387 |  is being chased by two England men, Foden and Bellingham and he uses Vavro back in his penalty
[1955.32 - 1961.32] P:1544.10 E:0.100332 |  area, long ball away from him and John Stones is able to to control it. Well England, their
[1961.32 - 1967.32] P:1476.60 E:0.100732 |  supporters want England to play on the front foot, dominate teams, they're 1-0 down and there will
[1967.32 - 1972.36] P:1463.65 E:0.099992 |  be a point where they have to throw caution to the wind and go at Slovakia, here's Trippier
[1973.32 - 1980.12] P:1588.75 E:0.097350 |  and back to from Foden to Trippier but that pass doesn't reach, Rice is kept in on the far side
[1980.12 - 1986.68] P:1521.80 E:0.088116 |  by the goal scorer, Schrantz and then Declan Rice is able to pull the ball down
[1987.64 - 1993.80] P:1513.10 E:0.102966 |  and Koby Mainu, 10 yards inside his own half, Garry Southgate watching in that cream shirt on
[1993.80 - 2000.04] P:1546.36 E:0.087122 |  the edge of the coaching area anxiously, here's Saka, now is able to chest the ball down but
[2000.04 - 2005.00] P:1671.23 E:0.108935 |  he's under pressure from Hans, goes exceptionally well, Hans goal then forward to Strelitz but
[2005.00 - 2011.24] P:1634.85 E:0.102772 |  who miscontrolled it and then Mainu just gets there, Kane inside his own half goes for a long pass
[2011.80 - 2018.60] P:1530.52 E:0.105630 |  that's intercepted, cleared away back to Harry Kane and then Kane just sensibly plays it to Rice in the centre circle
[2018.60 - 2023.00] P:1555.65 E:0.100801 |  I mean how well has Hans gone playing at left back as well, really getting tight to Saka, comfortable
[2023.00 - 2029.08] P:1609.54 E:0.097620 |  enough to get really tight and steal the ball off him, Bellingham that's good, now Trippier, Bellingham
[2029.08 - 2032.84] P:1637.72 E:0.113684 |  Bellingham wriggles into the penalty area, still going to the byline, chips it across,
[2032.84 - 2038.28] P:1729.37 E:0.119199 |  took an affection that takes it behind, into corner to England, and a big wave of the hands
[2038.36 - 2044.28] P:1663.06 E:0.106848 |  from Jude Bellingham to try and get the crowd up on their feet, get the fans behind England, he drives
[2044.28 - 2048.84] P:1596.68 E:0.104217 |  into the box, four or five Sevacian players all around him, they have to be careful, they stand
[2048.84 - 2052.76] P:1550.18 E:0.098349 |  off enough, tries to cross it with his left foot and is blocked and out for a corner
[2053.32 - 2058.04] P:1646.15 E:0.104013 |  well he has been more involved, it is more positive from Bellingham, here's the corner then,
[2058.04 - 2063.00] P:1650.81 E:0.104958 |  England have not really threatened from set pieces, Trippier waiting to take this, the referee just
[2063.00 - 2070.12] P:1490.54 E:0.107472 |  blows his whistle again, Trippier backs away, Kieran Trippier with the corner, into the near post,
[2070.12 - 2075.48] P:1640.68 E:0.105922 |  Kane was after it but it was headed by the near post by Vavro, we got there ahead of him, John
[2075.48 - 2083.32] P:1603.55 E:0.096900 |  Stones applauds the delivery, the second consecutive England corner, Trippier once more, behind him
[2083.32 - 2089.56] P:1621.33 E:0.102732 |  the backdrop is all of those England flags in the stands, Trippier still waits, Stones takes up a
[2089.56 - 2094.68] P:1535.79 E:0.109837 |  position at the near post and then in it goes, towards the near post the referee is buttering
[2094.68 - 2100.52] P:1692.03 E:0.101910 |  an infringement, was it a foul by Stones, was it Mark Gaye, it's a free kick down there to
[2100.52 - 2106.36] P:1621.43 E:0.100056 |  Slovakia and that was just a few yards away from Izzy Christensen, yeah Slovakia are playing a game
[2106.36 - 2110.52] P:1635.64 E:0.098268 |  that England aren't really used to playing, England are operating with a lot more control but
[2110.52 - 2114.52] P:1537.35 E:0.104621 |  every time England get into the attacking third the fans are obviously responding, the noise is
[2114.52 - 2119.88] P:1748.25 E:0.103150 |  deafening and then the response from Jude Bellingham on that last attack, he was geeing the crowd up
[2119.88 - 2124.20] P:1776.84 E:0.096219 |  getting everyone off their feet so they want it, of course they want it but it's coming and they've
[2124.20 - 2130.84] P:1812.15 E:0.109089 |  got to make it happen. Joel Hart up here, are you worried for England? Look it's definitely not been
[2130.84 - 2136.04] P:1852.48 E:0.102996 |  easy, it's a tough game, I think Slovakia look really organised as we expected, the way Lobocca's
[2136.04 - 2140.12] P:1656.06 E:0.099948 |  kind of orchestrating that I'm really enjoying watching him play from a neutral point of view but
[2140.92 - 2146.60] P:1484.51 E:0.106327 |  it's fits and starts isn't it, it's not a smooth performance by any means but we are creating
[2146.60 - 2152.04] P:1558.38 E:0.086132 |  chances, we do look dangerous but it's fits and starts and we're just crying out for that rhythm
[2152.04 - 2156.84] P:1546.07 E:0.085852 |  and it looks like Slovakia have really got that. Yeah they have, they look like a team, they're
[2156.84 - 2164.92] P:1629.18 E:0.100899 |  leading 1-0, I do feel that there's a very strong possibility of more goals in this match on the
[2164.92 - 2169.56] P:1622.84 E:0.095246 |  play that we've had, the goal that we scored, I think this sums them up really and sums up the
[2169.56 - 2173.88] P:1694.52 E:0.104357 |  spirit that they've got, it was Strelets who played it through so this is the striker who was
[2173.88 - 2182.44] P:1748.11 E:0.103419 |  on loan at Slovan Bratislava, the Slovak champions and he was scored by Trance of Slovia Prague.
[2183.96 - 2191.80] P:1611.84 E:0.106294 |  So in a normal sense you would say England would be strong, strong favourites dominating the game,
[2192.36 - 2198.04] P:1551.64 E:0.103050 |  their coach was saying yesterday this England scored it's worth 1.5 billion euros, our teams
[2198.04 - 2203.24] P:1364.65 E:0.097864 |  were at the 150 million. Yeah it's a good point, it's a really good point but they're playing
[2203.80 - 2211.64] P:1385.01 E:0.098608 |  like a team and Martin who was on earlier, Slovakian expert, that was the key point he made
[2211.64 - 2217.32] P:1436.83 E:0.102766 |  and that is what Calzón is all about, getting them to play to the strength of what he feels is the
[2217.32 - 2222.04] P:1466.64 E:0.098231 |  best way to be the best team and he picks the players accordingly and you can see it on the pitch,
[2222.04 - 2226.92] P:1508.98 E:0.092345 |  they're very well organised, they're pressing together and not all the time, they're not that
[2226.92 - 2231.80] P:1585.15 E:0.107341 |  suffocating high-pressure, letting England have the ball and we're just not moving the ball quickly
[2231.80 - 2236.20] P:1742.75 E:0.111591 |  enough, it's now with John Stones and between Pickford and it's just so pedestrian John,
[2236.20 - 2240.28] P:1732.50 E:0.106317 |  you're not going to break that down, there has to be more tempo to the play and then eventually
[2240.28 - 2244.44] P:1704.71 E:0.090833 |  Pickford just kicks the ball long. Yeah long pass from Pickford, Saker in on the challenge,
[2244.44 - 2250.36] P:1450.96 E:0.099632 |  hooked away by Haras Linn and all of the time with Slovakia having a 1-0 lead while England do look
[2250.44 - 2257.32] P:1497.96 E:0.092494 |  depressed forward then that opens the possibility for a second goal for Slovakia and here they are
[2257.32 - 2263.96] P:1563.82 E:0.106377 |  inside their own half challenge on Kutsk, Minu back to Dalingham, that was smooth from Dalingham
[2263.96 - 2270.44] P:1658.36 E:0.117361 |  and then he actually stood on the ball right and ended up being wrestled by Gouda and it's a
[2270.44 - 2275.24] P:1530.34 E:0.117321 |  great kick to England on the right hand side, lovely the way that he moved away there, his influence
[2275.24 - 2280.60] P:1314.95 E:0.106910 |  has been significantly great at Dalingham in this game. It has, I mean he just does some things
[2280.60 - 2286.84] P:1366.14 E:0.106268 |  that you look at and think how does he even think, I don't think he does think, he just does it, it's
[2286.84 - 2292.44] P:1499.05 E:0.101620 |  like the ability to see opportunities to sink in and out of situations and he does it in a fashion
[2292.44 - 2299.32] P:1426.58 E:0.108740 |  that's so smooth, I mean he's a joy to watch at times through Dalingham. We've got seven minutes
[2299.40 - 2306.28] P:1535.06 E:0.103687 |  to go to half time, Slovakia leading 1-0 folding to take this in from the right, the right flank
[2306.28 - 2311.88] P:1683.11 E:0.103709 |  left footed free kick in it goes, swirled excellent header away I think it was Skrinjar hooked away
[2311.88 - 2317.08] P:1679.75 E:0.096184 |  by Lobotka on the edge of the box, comes back to England, comes back to Walker who is quickly put
[2317.08 - 2321.88] P:1601.43 E:0.103708 |  under pressure, used Trippia, Trippia's angled high ball into the area, Rice gets his head to it to
[2321.88 - 2327.24] P:1627.71 E:0.096736 |  Brafko, comes challenge on him, that's not given us a free kick, the challenge by Dalingham and the
[2327.24 - 2330.76] P:1640.37 E:0.115238 |  ball is cleared towards the halfway line. They've defended the box really well there,
[2332.04 - 2338.28] P:1761.17 E:0.101891 |  top quality delivery in, I have to say the left footed cross from Bowdoin was brilliant. I think
[2338.28 - 2346.12] P:1666.37 E:0.097510 |  Kavro has ended up down in the referee's stop play so there's a chorus of whistles and the referee
[2346.12 - 2352.04] P:1653.79 E:0.099521 |  has waved on the medical people, Harry Kane has gone across, in fact I think to Brafko the goalkeeper
[2352.04 - 2357.00] P:1754.25 E:0.097205 |  actually caught Kavro with his hit as he came out. He clatters him, he comes for the ball
[2357.00 - 2361.08] P:1650.54 E:0.097685 |  to Brafko, he has to win it and he does that quite well, gets a right-handed punch on the ball but
[2361.08 - 2367.40] P:1504.70 E:0.091393 |  then the follow through really does clatter his teammate. Job? Yeah I see that, I've seen that
[2367.40 - 2371.16] P:1735.68 E:0.098561 |  England have a ploy, it looks like they're trying to whip it in on Dabravko actually, especially
[2371.16 - 2375.32] P:1638.41 E:0.092082 |  from the Kieran Trippia corners, I was interested to see who would take that free kick then and
[2375.32 - 2380.36] P:1596.51 E:0.100475 |  Foden did with the line being as deep as it well as high as it possibly could but I feel like England
[2380.36 - 2384.04] P:1647.09 E:0.098834 |  are really trying to put pressure on him, he's common he's done well there but in the previous
[2384.04 - 2388.04] P:1495.60 E:0.085909 |  when we had two or three corners in a row I think his defence had defended him really really well
[2388.04 - 2393.08] P:1643.56 E:0.097346 |  winning some really really big headers as we just see the replay of the goal now. Under the pressure
[2393.08 - 2398.04] P:1660.60 E:0.090318 |  of Mark Gay he potentially a foul, I think he's done really well to just outside of the foot,
[2398.04 - 2403.88] P:1623.05 E:0.096421 |  really really good finish, settle himself and a deserved lead. It's an area I think we can do
[2403.88 - 2407.40] P:1489.90 E:0.097562 |  better on those set pieces though Joe, I mean it was a real strength of England's wasn't it in
[2407.40 - 2411.16] P:1559.02 E:0.099079 |  previous tournaments and it hasn't quite been that this time. Yeah I've definitely not felt it,
[2411.16 - 2416.44] P:1684.95 E:0.096682 |  I've not felt the anticipation, I've not felt the buzz when a free kick's coming in, I've not seen
[2417.24 - 2422.28] P:1707.08 E:0.095997 |  too much in the way of different run-ups, different line-ups when it comes to it and
[2422.28 - 2425.56] P:1724.48 E:0.100750 |  especially this one, like I say it looks like they're going they're really going old school and
[2425.56 - 2430.12] P:1580.39 E:0.094077 |  they're looking to whip it on Dabravko and put as much pressure as they can. So Joe Hart, Matthew
[2430.12 - 2436.12] P:1597.97 E:0.094693 |  Upson, Izzy Christensen with us five live in the World Service, the football daily at the Euros
[2436.12 - 2442.68] P:1459.29 E:0.088443 |  will be available from BBC Sounds in the morning and right now there'll be some very unhappy
[2442.68 - 2450.60] P:1511.17 E:0.092578 |  England interviews in it if it stays like this. 1-0 to Slovakia from that Ivan Shrentz goal
[2450.60 - 2457.24] P:1522.26 E:0.103502 |  which puts him alongside Mikau Tadze and Muzeala as the joint leading scorers at the Euros,
[2457.24 - 2462.76] P:1593.49 E:0.096600 |  the Georgians tonight playing Spain, that's our next commentary with Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton
[2462.76 - 2469.88] P:1489.33 E:0.096761 |  who will be inside the stadium in Cologne so that's still to come tonight but here England up
[2469.88 - 2480.12] P:1471.77 E:0.093098 |  against it, Neynu back to Gae, Vavro has come back onto the field so he's okay and Slovakia are back
[2480.12 - 2485.64] P:1587.53 E:0.096140 |  up to their full complement. Here's John Stones who is in deep discussions with Gara Southgate on
[2485.64 - 2490.20] P:1634.63 E:0.098855 |  the edge of the pitch while Vavro is receiving his treatment Gae that's a good ball to Trivia,
[2490.28 - 2495.24] P:1577.29 E:0.099948 |  now to Foden on that left flank, Orange Boots comes in field, White strapping on his hand,
[2495.24 - 2503.48] P:1477.35 E:0.092298 |  Foden then back to Neynu, calm from him to Walker, Walker then back to Foden, White central, Foden's
[2503.48 - 2507.96] P:1668.74 E:0.107923 |  able to take the ball away, look for the space then curls into the box but that's way beyond Trivia
[2507.96 - 2512.84] P:1723.21 E:0.111477 |  and through, all the way through for a goal kick. A nice run from Trivia looking to get in behind
[2512.84 - 2518.36] P:1484.50 E:0.101859 |  but really difficult ball to execute from Foden, had to be absolutely inch perfect to drop it at
[2518.36 - 2522.92] P:1608.71 E:0.095432 |  that kind of angle, it's quite a straight pass with a little bit of angle just to think it over
[2523.80 - 2530.20] P:1709.51 E:0.100825 |  the top of the Slovakian right back but all just skips out of play and England resets,
[2530.20 - 2536.52] P:1776.17 E:0.106623 |  Slovakia looking to go along with the bracket, banging his studs against the post, that's what
[2536.52 - 2542.20] P:1581.26 E:0.099343 |  you could hear there, the Slovakian supporters in great voice here, they are outnumbered
[2543.00 - 2549.88] P:1404.79 E:0.097647 |  by well significantly by the England fans but what a what a score line they have here inside
[2549.88 - 2556.36] P:1649.39 E:0.111498 |  the stadium, Slovakia are given a throw in on the far side and the assistant appears to have changed
[2556.36 - 2561.08] P:1467.85 E:0.112485 |  his point, he's given it to England's way. I mean was that just on appeal then John, that's because
[2561.08 - 2564.76] P:1507.22 E:0.097734 |  he was adamant, I mean it's miles out, I think the referee could see it from the middle of the pitch,
[2564.76 - 2568.84] P:1563.32 E:0.097427 |  he was about a yard out. Yeah I think I presume it was a discussion between the two of them on there.
[2569.08 - 2577.08] P:1751.73 E:0.100784 |  He's held the ball up really well, Strollik up front, I think he's not charging around,
[2577.08 - 2581.16] P:1813.19 E:0.101224 |  he's not exerting too much energy but when his team needs it, I think he's held it and moved
[2581.16 - 2586.28] P:1699.18 E:0.108062 |  the ball really well. I mean he's not a goal threat is he? Like you say, the role that he's playing
[2586.28 - 2590.92] P:1600.08 E:0.099650 |  is significant, he's looked shattered from the first minute but literally whenever he's got the ball
[2590.92 - 2596.84] P:1613.46 E:0.098675 |  he's still going, there he is, he's on his hunches. Yeah he is, we're ready. Pass down the line from
[2596.84 - 2603.08] P:1580.36 E:0.095039 |  Walker, Saka can't reach that. If it stays like this I think the expectation will be that we will
[2603.08 - 2608.12] P:1531.37 E:0.092882 |  see those changes coming from Garasouthgate. Quite soon you think as well, I mean half time
[2608.92 - 2615.08] P:1414.89 E:0.093843 |  is nearly upon us and I'm sure you may even see a change at half time though, will be quite the
[2615.08 - 2619.64] P:1542.51 E:0.101379 |  clamour for Cole Tarma and I noticed that the television camera has already picked him out,
[2620.28 - 2626.28] P:1474.26 E:0.097281 |  here's Declan Rice, Garasouthgate and his team they could do with a goal before half time.
[2627.80 - 2634.20] P:1525.12 E:0.113191 |  And we are in the 44th minute, but John Stoence has quite heavily challenged. That's a yellow card by
[2635.00 - 2641.56] P:1491.58 E:0.096510 |  Duda. Maybe not, no, it's not. Well, is he feeling okay? I don't know.
[2643.56 - 2647.80] P:1536.24 E:0.101358 |  And that was charitable because Duda is one of the slow backs who's on a yellow card. I mean that's
[2647.80 - 2653.96] P:1491.42 E:0.088320 |  miles more of a yellow card for me than the main one and I tackle earlier because he really just
[2654.04 - 2656.84] P:1499.74 E:0.104009 |  take him out. Yeah, that was deliberate. That was 100% deliberate. He kicks it from behind Joe,
[2656.84 - 2662.52] P:1434.84 E:0.097945 |  it's a yellow card. Yeah, I agree. And there's Gay with the ball inside his own hum across to
[2662.52 - 2670.92] P:1573.03 E:0.102235 |  Stoence and then here to Walker. Walker then forward towards Mikhail Saka who is very tightly
[2672.36 - 2679.48] P:1612.14 E:0.103147 |  challenged by Hans Kov. That's a free kick. England and Garasouthgate's three tournaments have always
[2679.56 - 2686.12] P:1623.04 E:0.097232 |  won the round of 16 match. Remember the penalty shootout against Columbia in Moscow and then
[2686.68 - 2692.92] P:1486.94 E:0.100508 |  as Foden chases this ball downfield, that's headed away. It's flicked away, then Gay back out to
[2692.92 - 2698.44] P:1431.01 E:0.105844 |  Tribbjerg on the far side and then back to Gay. The last Euros it was Germany, that's famous 2-0 win
[2698.44 - 2704.92] P:1378.51 E:0.101220 |  against Germany at Wembley at this stage of the competition and then in Qatar the handsome 3-0 win
[2704.92 - 2712.20] P:1394.81 E:0.095997 |  against Senegal. But this is a different matter. 1-0 down to Slovakia all towards the left-hand
[2712.20 - 2720.44] P:1593.27 E:0.095747 |  side. Three minutes of added time at the end of the first half and then we will try and explain
[2720.44 - 2727.24] P:1787.49 E:0.107866 |  this away. There goes the board. Walker to Kobimenev and then infield from Saka.
[2728.44 - 2733.16] P:1720.08 E:0.119951 |  Jude Dalingham. Inko Skriniar with a challenge on him. That was a heavy one and that will be a
[2733.24 - 2737.72] P:1646.32 E:0.107288 |  yellow card. Skriniar turns as though he can't believe it but out comes the card for the Slovak
[2737.72 - 2742.84] P:1633.83 E:0.101134 |  captain. I just felt, I mean you could see he had the intent in the way he went after
[2742.84 - 2747.24] P:1677.31 E:0.093204 |  Bellingham there and you thought okay you're putting the pressure on but don't do anything drastic and
[2747.24 - 2752.04] P:1602.99 E:0.095623 |  he goes to ground, he slides alongside. I'm not sure if he really does catch him to be honest but
[2752.84 - 2757.32] P:1562.64 E:0.089915 |  there was real intent from Skriniar. Knew what he was doing Matt. Yeah he did and with this
[2757.32 - 2761.08] P:1507.11 E:0.101297 |  referee as Joe's already mentioned you can't take the risk. You whip out that yellow card
[2761.64 - 2768.68] P:1610.48 E:0.100993 |  blink of an eye. However he's a great old professional Skriniar and he took that moment
[2768.68 - 2773.88] P:1662.81 E:0.109418 |  to impose himself on Bellingham even if the yellow card followed. He is Bellingham now to the right
[2773.88 - 2781.64] P:1760.46 E:0.105582 |  hand side. Saka nice footwork from him. He was caught. It was run away by Hanscoe but the
[2781.64 - 2786.76] P:1801.26 E:0.103033 |  free kick had been given and this is a set piece in a good position and then Kyle Walker just grabbing
[2786.76 - 2791.64] P:1582.91 E:0.092382 |  the ball back from Hanscoe but a free kick on the right in added time. Yeah the trailer leg,
[2791.64 - 2796.12] P:1538.58 E:0.104917 |  trailing leg just catches and I'm looking at the replay of the Skriniar one that's a harsh yellow
[2796.12 - 2800.76] P:1595.99 E:0.100448 |  card actually. He does slide on the floor Skriniar alongside Bellingham and he does slightly
[2800.76 - 2804.28] P:1625.92 E:0.096536 |  catch him John but he doesn't kick him. Do you know what I mean? It's not. It was the way Bellingham
[2804.28 - 2809.72] P:1612.56 E:0.105461 |  went down. It was and the referee got drawn into the yellow card. I can see why it feels
[2809.72 - 2814.52] P:1681.00 E:0.106262 |  hard done by but this is a great position. Foden left foot just off the corner of the 18 yard
[2814.60 - 2820.20] P:1767.75 E:0.107598 |  box. Right opportunity to whip the ball in. 90 seconds of the first half left. England up against
[2820.20 - 2825.40] P:1817.69 E:0.104860 |  it. One nil down here in Gelsenkirchen. Foden waiting. One foot in front of the other. The
[2825.40 - 2831.00] P:1746.75 E:0.102570 |  referee sorted out the wall. Then he runs over there next to the penalty spot. So stones and
[2831.00 - 2837.48] P:1619.60 E:0.112420 |  rice near the penalty spot. Bellingham's there as well. Kane's near the back post. Mark Gay up to
[2837.48 - 2841.88] P:1751.59 E:0.107665 |  Foden. Swirls it in to Brabka. Comes I think might have been in two minds. Headed back into the box
[2841.88 - 2846.04] P:1709.52 E:0.103439 |  then flicked forward by Rice. Kane was in an offside position so didn't even go for the ball
[2846.04 - 2850.76] P:1723.41 E:0.105942 |  and Skriniar was able to probably get away. Cheers from the slow back supporters. They're held out
[2850.76 - 2855.32] P:1671.80 E:0.112069 |  there but England come again. Maynou lovely. Maynou's right foot shot. That's deflected wide
[2855.32 - 2862.84] P:1771.32 E:0.115053 |  of goal. It's a corner. Lovely play from Maynou. Takes the ball lovely as he does on the back foot.
[2862.84 - 2867.24] P:1719.54 E:0.107480 |  Drives it several players. Rolls his foot over the ball. Gets a shot up and it could have deflected
[2867.24 - 2871.56] P:1532.07 E:0.103919 |  anywhere. Could have ended up being really difficult for the Brafker but he's gone out for
[2871.64 - 2876.92] P:1712.21 E:0.096629 |  a corner and Trippia is not going to take this one. So this will not be whipped in under the
[2876.92 - 2882.12] P:1730.82 E:0.100213 |  crossbar. It's a left-footed corner from Foden. Trippia leaves him to it. The out swing at
[2882.12 - 2888.36] P:1712.23 E:0.102387 |  towards the penalty spot. It's over Kane. We've got 20 seconds of the first half to go. Maynou
[2889.56 - 2893.88] P:1743.35 E:0.101436 |  then to Saka. Saka's shot. That hits a defender. Bounces out to Maynou on the right-hand side.
[2893.88 - 2898.84] P:1692.04 E:0.109535 |  Maynou kicks on his man Lobotka. In comes the cross. Brilliantly headed away. The halftime
[2898.84 - 2903.72] P:1812.18 E:0.110459 |  whistle is coming any moment. Trippia back to Foden. This will be the last chance to attack in
[2903.72 - 2908.36] P:1756.29 E:0.115320 |  the half. Rice with the cross. That's out of play. It's a corner. The referee looks at his watch.
[2909.56 - 2914.04] P:1682.32 E:0.115602 |  England mill. The time is almost up at the end of the first period. Foden's across there to take it.
[2914.04 - 2917.72] P:1675.87 E:0.114935 |  It's the back here hanging on under real pressure but I have to say they're defending the box.
[2918.76 - 2924.92] P:1704.44 E:0.093709 |  Favreau has got his head on the end of everything so far. Last chance for the half. Last chance for
[2925.00 - 2932.04] P:1671.36 E:0.109805 |  an equaliser. Thordon deep. Kane shoots wide of goal and the whistle goes. It's actually gone for a
[2932.04 - 2937.64] P:1667.20 E:0.103469 |  free kick. Maybe a challenge by Bellingham. It's a free kick to Slovakia and that's the end of that.
[2937.64 - 2942.04] P:1667.65 E:0.103308 |  Yeah the referee's seen something in the box. It's very crowded. I think it's a shot from John
[2942.04 - 2947.72] P:1666.49 E:0.093355 |  Stones actually in the Slovakian play-up. It just goes down quite easily but it is a foul from
[2947.72 - 2954.36] P:1689.00 E:0.093200 |  Stones. He really tries to shrug his man off. Yeah that was hectic. That was a hectic couple of
[2954.36 - 2958.20] P:1757.34 E:0.115426 |  minutes. England really pushing but you know Slovakia stood strong. They stood really strong.
[2959.32 - 2964.76] P:1834.69 E:0.109671 |  A really really really interesting half time coming up. There goes the half time whistle.
[2964.76 - 2970.36] P:1752.86 E:0.096011 |  Gareth Southgate head down. Disappears down the steps and up that mineshaft style tunnel
[2970.36 - 2976.60] P:1666.41 E:0.101068 |  to the dressing room whereas Joe Hart has said he has a very big half time discussion to have
[2976.60 - 2982.68] P:1645.17 E:0.097078 |  and some big decisions to make because at the break with this scoreline England are going out
[2982.76 - 2989.08] P:1641.68 E:0.091373 |  and Slovakia are going through to the quarter-finals. England nil, Slovakia won and here's Mark
[2989.08 - 2994.36] P:1608.55 E:0.093858 |  Chapman who is inside the stadium with us. Just before we get to the overall passes of playing
[2994.36 - 2997.64] P:1533.22 E:0.094867 |  that first half you're going to have to go some to beat them in the air aren't you?
[2999.40 - 3003.56] P:1667.21 E:0.093358 |  Are they committed by any chance? I mean they are going at it. Every challenge,
[3003.56 - 3007.88] P:1587.52 E:0.100772 |  anything that is in the air they are leaping. Like the centre forward it doesn't look like
[3007.88 - 3011.96] P:1648.26 E:0.090868 |  he's going to be much of a goal threat but he's coming across the centre arms and getting
[3011.96 - 3016.36] P:1539.42 E:0.095997 |  older the ball flicking it on, chesting it down. I mean it's impressive what they've done in that
[3016.36 - 3021.00] P:1528.53 E:0.098732 |  opening 45 minutes. It is, even in this day and age you can't beat a good old-fashioned header can you?
[3022.52 - 3027.56] P:1592.04 E:0.113319 |  I'm not self but you've got two big guys next year up there. Mark Upsen heading them away and
[3027.56 - 3031.40] P:1679.90 E:0.110496 |  Joe Hart coming and catching them but I'm not going to be a great in the air is he? Oh I had a
[3031.40 - 3036.92] P:1513.21 E:0.101192 |  decent jump I won't lie. But they're solid aren't they? They really are and my question you know is
[3036.92 - 3041.48] P:1439.08 E:0.098504 |  how long can Slovakia keep up this rhythm and the tempo. England are starting to really grind
[3041.48 - 3045.16] P:1349.93 E:0.098632 |  them down and if anything half-time has just come at the wrong time for England because you could
[3045.16 - 3050.28] P:1543.32 E:0.106268 |  feel the energy behind me here with the fans getting right on top of it and like Joe said a
[3050.28 - 3055.72] P:1706.18 E:0.093899 |  very interesting half-second half-team talk. I mean the stat that's just come on our screen Joe has
[3055.72 - 3062.20] P:1695.90 E:0.095858 |  England at 75% possession as Slovakia RIT 20 back. I'll be honest to me it didn't feel like that at
[3062.20 - 3067.24] P:1742.53 E:0.093761 |  times in that first half but maybe that's because England were doing a lot with their possession.
[3067.24 - 3072.28] P:1672.61 E:0.096994 |  Yeah it doesn't feel like a completely dominant performance that would back that stat up but
[3072.28 - 3077.72] P:1678.60 E:0.098041 |  I think Slovakia have been very good with the ball. They've been very organised, they're playing
[3077.72 - 3084.04] P:1724.34 E:0.078220 |  from the same sort of positions and they've certainly got a way of attacking. England having a
[3084.04 - 3088.76] P:1667.51 E:0.090971 |  lot of possession but an awful lot of it's passing and then with the arms in the air because they're
[3088.76 - 3091.96] P:1741.02 E:0.086019 |  looking for that. They are looking for that forward pass but it's just I think Slovakia
[3091.96 - 3096.12] P:1677.32 E:0.092475 |  strategically are looking very good. The stats was leading because we've had so much time just
[3096.20 - 3100.12] P:1695.81 E:0.089892 |  stood on the ball. I mean how many times the centre back or Jordan Pickford even just stood there
[3100.12 - 3105.16] P:1771.22 E:0.086718 |  with the ball not moved. It really frustrates me because I think even if you're not going to be
[3105.16 - 3110.84] P:1751.15 E:0.091077 |  progressive get a pass off. Just get that tempo rolling it's so slow in the build-up. Who needs
[3110.84 - 3115.40] P:1826.46 E:0.090721 |  to take the initiative on that then because as you say stones to gay, gays to stones maybe to
[3115.40 - 3121.88] P:1675.98 E:0.089551 |  walk and back to stones back back to Pickford maybe out to Trippier back inside. Is it midfielders
[3121.88 - 3125.80] P:1790.79 E:0.095659 |  offering themselves? Is it the defenders going do you know what if there's no option there we'll
[3125.80 - 3130.84] P:1686.56 E:0.083412 |  try and turn them and get in behind them. What is it? Well either bounce it bounce it to someone
[3130.84 - 3135.72] P:1659.82 E:0.086171 |  get it back and then the pitch will change if we're moving and we've got to move off the ball
[3135.72 - 3140.76] P:1734.88 E:0.084014 |  to create that and there's been moments where we have that you see flashes of it and you go oh yeah
[3140.76 - 3147.24] P:1759.05 E:0.082471 |  and then it goes away but foot on the ball at the back for me I just I can't bear it. I'd rather
[3147.24 - 3151.80] P:1718.65 E:0.085032 |  just get a pass off into car walker get it back and then all of a sudden where's the pass now but
[3151.88 - 3156.52] P:1612.47 E:0.087708 |  it's a tempo that you create and we don't have that tempo when we're trying to play through.
[3156.52 - 3163.24] P:1733.32 E:0.090553 |  You may correct me on this Izzy but it feels like most of the players want to take an extra touch.
[3163.24 - 3169.24] P:1752.29 E:0.094739 |  I feel like if it goes into Maynou it goes again very quickly he doesn't he likes to play one touch.
[3169.24 - 3172.92] P:1802.19 E:0.100576 |  Yeah. There are a few of the others who are maybe taking two or three touches and you can feel the
[3172.92 - 3177.48] P:1707.59 E:0.093526 |  frustration in the crowd. Yeah you can and I think you can see you can see that on the pitch that the
[3177.48 - 3182.52] P:1636.90 E:0.090320 |  crowd are responding exactly like you say but Coby Maynou has been outstanding exactly what you
[3182.52 - 3187.24] P:1712.55 E:0.090039 |  say there Chappers. He's been moving the ball quickly he's looked sharp and in advanced positions in
[3187.24 - 3191.72] P:1785.74 E:0.088267 |  and around the box he's been crisp with his passing and I think there's just a little bit of a disconnect
[3191.72 - 3195.72] P:1562.75 E:0.096877 |  between the players that are taking a few more touches than needed because this is a team game
[3195.72 - 3201.40] P:1672.51 E:0.088738 |  this is about a system it's about us working in being fluid together as a team and unfortunately
[3201.40 - 3205.96] P:1747.19 E:0.091149 |  there are a few out there who are taking more touches and I think I can see it frustrating the
[3205.96 - 3210.84] P:1572.16 E:0.091050 |  other players around them but let me be honest here I think this is a better England performance
[3210.84 - 3214.68] P:1528.06 E:0.084978 |  but my word they're one nil down and they've got some they've got some work to do. When you move
[3214.68 - 3221.24] P:1503.14 E:0.084276 |  the ball quickly it's simple it's hard but it's simple and it's that simplicity that then breaks
[3221.24 - 3227.00] P:1709.61 E:0.088988 |  teams down because it's quick and the touches too many touches it just kills it kills the player
[3227.00 - 3231.40] P:1733.23 E:0.089467 |  trying to receive the ball and the pitch is gone so that for me is the reason why even Pickford and
[3231.40 - 3236.20] P:1706.30 E:0.088829 |  the two centre backs while there's nothing on just move it quick and get that ball moving.
[3236.92 - 3242.52] P:1737.71 E:0.092998 |  I've just had some stats typed into the dock by the production team on my behalf. Total shots
[3242.52 - 3249.16] P:1759.06 E:0.084957 |  England six, Slovakia four. What was interesting is that they've also typed in aerial duels one
[3249.16 - 3254.04] P:1722.07 E:0.098075 |  but originally they put an extra one in it so we look like England five, Slovakia 110 which would
[3254.04 - 3258.76] P:1698.91 E:0.099617 |  have been which would have been taking it taking this a little bit too far but 10 Slovakia of one
[3258.76 - 3262.52] P:1766.59 E:0.093366 |  compared to England five. My only other thing before we go to the news
[3264.04 - 3269.24] P:1763.63 E:0.089913 |  you do wonder whether the referee's going to play a part in this because he's fussy isn't he?
[3270.04 - 3274.36] P:1784.92 E:0.102458 |  He seems to be drawn into the if there's something going on in the middle of the field and there's
[3274.36 - 3278.84] P:1737.62 E:0.091937 |  lots of bodies and the tackle goes in he's very keen to get his cards out it doesn't matter the
[3278.84 - 3284.68] P:1743.49 E:0.096977 |  severity of the tackle or the offense he's keen to brandish and then we saw and isolated it to
[3284.92 - 3289.72] P:1883.22 E:0.103389 |  where John Stones was was dawdling a little bit on the ball and took a deliberate kick a yellow card
[3289.72 - 3294.20] P:1811.48 E:0.093830 |  in all of our eyes because it didn't have the drama of about four or five players around it
[3294.20 - 3299.08] P:1828.41 E:0.101440 |  he just let it slide. He's not for me the way he's refereeing the game. I think lots of games have
[3299.08 - 3304.36] P:1703.56 E:0.101092 |  been really well refereed actually this tournament but this one here is making a problem in this
[3304.36 - 3308.60] P:1710.63 E:0.101742 |  game like you just mentioned and it doesn't need to be there but Mattie I think one thing that we'd
[3308.60 - 3312.92] P:1832.03 E:0.101884 |  need to definitely take on board is that referee's not changing. No he isn't so that's the conversation
[3313.00 - 3316.92] P:1805.57 E:0.095327 |  at halftime that referee's not changing whether he's wrong or right he could be getting a second
[3316.92 - 3322.20] P:1670.65 E:0.084333 |  yellow card out or a very soft red card so hopefully not but we'll see. Slovakia won
[3322.20 - 3328.04] P:1461.27 E:0.095081 |  England nil at the Brake Mall from Joe and Matt and Izzy and John to come in the second half on
[3328.04 - 3335.56] P:1605.87 E:0.098398 |  the way as well but at just shy of five two or just shy of seven o'clock actually here in Germany

[3354.60 - 3359.64] P:1933.38 E:0.089240 |  two weeks ago to say he was lost in the mountains. He hasn't been seen since despite a huge search

[3449.96 - 3456.68] P:1502.19 E:0.092543 |  if England equalised John Murray will do something similar. To Andy Murray who says he should be able
[3456.68 - 3461.72] P:1558.79 E:0.090836 |  to make a decision tomorrow afternoon or evening about completing a Wimbledon. The championship
[3461.72 - 3468.36] P:1517.48 E:0.095712 |  gets underway tomorrow coverage here on 5 Live from 1pm. Here is Andy Murray with our tennis
[3468.36 - 3474.84] P:1468.74 E:0.064707 |  correspondent Russell Fuller. Andy, it's just eight days since you had that spinal cyst surgery.
[3474.84 - 3478.52] P:1728.26 E:0.078159 |  How much progress do you feel you've made over the past week? What have you been able to do on the
[3478.52 - 3484.84] P:1427.98 E:0.065525 |  practice court? How are you feeling? Yeah, a lot of progress. Whether that's going to be enough or not,
[3484.84 - 3492.68] P:1603.38 E:0.062647 |  I don't know yet. I practiced on the grass last couple of days, last three days I practiced on
[3492.68 - 3498.20] P:1369.39 E:0.062629 |  the grass and then played a set today. I'm going to play a set again tomorrow. I'm going to do some
[3498.20 - 3503.80] P:1520.26 E:0.069113 |  physical testing in the morning before that just to run my movement to see where that is and then
[3504.44 - 3510.76] P:1301.31 E:0.057094 |  you know, I should probably be able to make a decision tomorrow afternoon or evening.
[3511.48 - 3516.20] P:1317.90 E:0.055012 |  Every day it's been getting better and better. I just don't know whether it's enough time.
[3516.20 - 3519.96] P:1537.74 E:0.072162 |  But the way you're talking sounds like you think there's a genuine chance you might now be able to
[3519.96 - 3525.80] P:1444.12 E:0.061852 |  play singles. Well, I played a set today and it was not the best set of tennis I've ever played,
[3525.80 - 3532.28] P:1480.61 E:0.064410 |  but I was hitting the ball extremely well. My team said that if they didn't know what was going on,
[3532.36 - 3539.08] P:1506.35 E:0.068966 |  they wouldn't have been like aware that I had an issue. So, if I can improve a little bit again
[3539.08 - 3546.12] P:1583.51 E:0.064331 |  tomorrow and on Tuesday then, yeah, there's a chance. I think it's more likely that I wouldn't
[3546.12 - 3552.44] P:1180.92 E:0.051372 |  play singles if I'm being honest right now, but we'll see how the next couple of days go.
[3552.44 - 3557.64] P:1559.78 E:0.069260 |  But it bodes well for the doubles where you'll have an extra three days potentially
[3557.64 - 3564.28] P:1616.36 E:0.059116 |  and it's three sets rather than five. Yeah, I mean, look, it's, to be honest, I'm not so concerned
[3564.28 - 3570.52] P:1513.69 E:0.051333 |  about the amount of like the length of the match and stuff. It's just whether I can feel my leg
[3570.52 - 3575.96] P:1321.39 E:0.072930 |  properly. If I can feel my leg properly, I don't care whether it's five sets or three sets,
[3575.96 - 3581.32] P:1521.14 E:0.066390 |  singles or doubles, but that's what I'm just waiting for the nerve to fully resolve
[3581.56 - 3588.12] P:1310.56 E:0.068788 |  before I'm able to play properly again. And yeah, obviously the more days that go by,
[3588.12 - 3592.84] P:1406.07 E:0.063513 |  the more chance there is of that happening and doubles starting later in the week,
[3593.56 - 3599.88] P:1526.13 E:0.057466 |  obviously gives me a better chance. We've discussed before the difficulty of top athletes choosing
[3599.88 - 3605.48] P:1406.33 E:0.068340 |  the right moment to go out or at least in the right surroundings. If it is a case of going out
[3605.48 - 3610.44] P:1327.84 E:0.055903 |  on a doubles court, on centre court with your brother Jamie alongside you, then from my perspective,
[3610.52 - 3615.80] P:1211.46 E:0.063584 |  it doesn't get too much better than that, does it? Yeah, I mean, well, who says we're going to go out
[3615.80 - 3621.24] P:1538.27 E:0.070898 |  on who says we're going to go out if we get to play on centre? I mean, I think we can win matches,
[3621.24 - 3627.40] P:1461.16 E:0.068116 |  but yeah, I mean, if that's the way it is, then yeah, like I'm okay with that as well. And, you
[3627.40 - 3632.92] P:1333.38 E:0.057054 |  know, obviously me and Jamie had never played here before. So, you know, that'd be really special,
[3632.92 - 3639.08] P:1471.19 E:0.067458 |  not just for me, but I think for all of our family as well. And if that's the way it is, then
[3639.88 - 3642.76] P:1176.06 E:0.080463 |  that's the way it is. And I'll enjoy every moment of that.
[3643.88 - 3651.16] P:1630.20 E:0.087320 |  Andy Murray with Russell Fuller. So coverage of that begins tomorrow on Five Live. George Russell
[3651.16 - 3657.56] P:1579.83 E:0.084449 |  won the Austrian Grand Prix for Mercedes and McLaren's Oscar Piazzari was second. Carlo Sainz
[3657.56 - 3664.68] P:1775.61 E:0.095061 |  was back in third in the Ferrari. The late match this evening at the Euros is Spain against Georgia.
[3664.92 - 3670.20] P:1804.42 E:0.083621 |  Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton are in Cologne and Spain, given the fact that they're the only
[3670.20 - 3674.36] P:1798.59 E:0.097352 |  side to win all of their group matches. Ian are probably the favourites at the moment,
[3674.36 - 3679.40] P:1786.11 E:0.094821 |  along with the hosts. Yes, not only have they won all three matches, they're yet to concede a goal.
[3679.40 - 3683.48] P:1727.84 E:0.091117 |  It's only been done once before in the history of the European Championship. And that was this
[3683.48 - 3687.80] P:1755.63 E:0.101760 |  late the last Euros, of course, went on to win it. And notably as well, Mark, every outfield
[3687.80 - 3693.56] P:1770.92 E:0.093266 |  player has been used in the in this tournament so far. And the fact that they made 10 changes
[3693.56 - 3699.40] P:1566.46 E:0.096710 |  in their last group game means that the first 11 will have had a nine-day rest coming into this
[3699.40 - 3704.04] P:1833.80 E:0.090026 |  game against the surprise package, Georgia. Well, Georgia, Chris, have been one of the most enjoyable
[3704.04 - 3710.84] P:1858.44 E:0.082975 |  sides to watch at this tournament so far. Do you give them any chance? Well, we've got to give
[3710.84 - 3716.52] P:1923.11 E:0.089802 |  them a chance. But personally, I don't. I think Spain will wipe the floor with them. But the
[3716.52 - 3723.40] P:1861.36 E:0.090482 |  victory against Portugal, I think their mindset going into this game is, you know, there are
[3723.40 - 3728.36] P:1811.79 E:0.090721 |  possibilities. But they're going to have to have to be the game of the life, really, to beat this
[3728.36 - 3733.00] P:1849.30 E:0.092912 |  Spanish team. I think they're the best team I've seen in the competition so far. Ian's right about
[3733.00 - 3737.48] P:1860.16 E:0.087190 |  they had the luxury to rest so many players in the last game. They'll come back. This will be
[3737.48 - 3741.56] P:1782.78 E:0.089252 |  against Spain's first 11. And I don't want to take anything away from Georgia, but it wasn't
[3741.64 - 3747.48] P:1814.41 E:0.084496 |  against the strongest Portuguese team. But for them to get... But they've got a good balance about them, Chris.
[3748.52 - 3754.68] P:1812.95 E:0.088595 |  They have. I mean, they're not possession-based. They'll sit deep. I mean, the forwards, perhaps
[3754.68 - 3759.48] P:1740.50 E:0.084109 |  Scalia and Miquetad, I think I'm right in saying, you know, they've been practicing these pronunciations
[3759.48 - 3765.72] P:1799.70 E:0.086876 |  all day. They carry a threat. They play two up top and they keep two up top. But doing that against
[3765.72 - 3770.36] P:1832.60 E:0.088894 |  Spain, I think, is so, so dangerous. And Spain will get overloads in the middle of the push. And
[3770.36 - 3775.32] P:1786.72 E:0.090637 |  that is going to be their problem. But if they hang on in there, they may create one or two
[3775.32 - 3781.64] P:1753.78 E:0.079603 |  opportunities. But I mean, Spain are looking ominous in this competition. All right, Ian, Chris,
[3781.64 - 3787.96] P:1640.72 E:0.090021 |  thank you very much. More from them a little bit later on. Spain against Georgia kicks off an eight
[3787.96 - 3792.92] P:1627.90 E:0.101251 |  thought UK time. All the build-up with those two to come a little bit later on England already,
[3793.64 - 3799.72] P:1562.35 E:0.088986 |  making their way out. Does it look like they're going to make any changes at the moment? They
[3799.72 - 3804.44] P:1703.18 E:0.092302 |  haven't had a shot on target, though, Johan, in that first half. According to Alpe, you have to
[3804.44 - 3809.88] P:1675.21 E:0.092285 |  go back to 1986 for the last time that happened at a major tournament. Was the Harry Kane block
[3809.88 - 3813.80] P:1684.06 E:0.092312 |  tackling the first half? I'm not sure they can alter our character that as a shot on target.
[3813.80 - 3818.76] P:1730.75 E:0.099154 |  But that shows, doesn't it? For all the possession, they've got to have that possession higher up.
[3819.72 - 3824.04] P:1607.14 E:0.092460 |  Yeah, and they were pushing towards the end. Some good crosses coming in, but a resolute
[3824.04 - 3829.40] P:1757.54 E:0.088220 |  defending from Slovakia. Look, the optimistic side of me is saying that we're going to wear them down.
[3829.48 - 3833.56] P:1891.75 E:0.084776 |  We're going to make it tough. And those sorts of last-ditch headers become a lot more difficult.
[3833.56 - 3838.52] P:1826.43 E:0.095115 |  65, 70 minutes into a game when that possession does add up. So that possession doesn't necessarily
[3838.52 - 3842.44] P:1825.19 E:0.091355 |  win you the game in the first half, but it puts a lot of pressure on you as an opposition, puts a
[3842.44 - 3846.68] P:1840.09 E:0.086243 |  lot of miles in the legs for the opposition, and that pressure is going to build.
[3846.68 - 3851.56] P:1762.30 E:0.095259 |  Oli Watkins and Cole Palmer, the two subs who came out first to warm up during that interval.
[3851.56 - 3855.16] P:1718.09 E:0.094242 |  We shall see if they come on during this 45 minutes is John Murray.
[3856.04 - 3864.28] P:1804.43 E:0.083536 |  The pressure is on. England nil Slovakia won as the second half is about to begin. England
[3864.28 - 3870.84] P:1653.03 E:0.091676 |  unchanged at halftime. Pickford, Walker-Stone, Gaye and Trippier, Menu Rice, Saka, Bellingham,
[3870.84 - 3878.04] P:1676.26 E:0.084941 |  Foden and Kane, and yellow cards already for Bellingham, Menu and Gaye who would be suspended
[3878.04 - 3881.72] P:1754.24 E:0.098453 |  for a quarter-final. But at the moment it's going to be Slovakia against Switzerland. There's the
[3881.72 - 3889.00] P:1688.83 E:0.089198 |  whistle from referee Umut Melair. England kickoff, all in white, back to Pickford, all in green,
[3889.00 - 3895.88] P:1538.23 E:0.090051 |  a long ball down the middle that is headed away by Vavro and the Slovakian team. Dubravka of New
[3895.88 - 3902.12] P:1516.72 E:0.098772 |  Castling goal as they play a ball forward that Walker will steer back with his left foot to Pickford,
[3902.84 - 3906.84] P:1476.88 E:0.100139 |  who gives it back to Walker who's in a little bit of pressure down there but passes it forward to
[3906.84 - 3912.20] P:1477.62 E:0.095740 |  Saka who has to come and get it halfway inside his own half and then Walker goes in field towards
[3912.20 - 3919.48] P:1570.06 E:0.094003 |  John Stones. Slovakia with this press that they've become notable for. Stralets is reading that
[3919.48 - 3924.92] P:1549.45 E:0.105411 |  and England are able to move it through Pickford to Trippier. Pickford's ball out that could give
[3924.92 - 3932.44] P:1564.56 E:0.091894 |  it away, comes off Foden, bounces through the middle for Duda and then Kutska and now on the right
[3932.44 - 3939.80] P:1629.36 E:0.086466 |  hand side the goal scorer at Schrantz and then back to Kutska, Slovakia in this almost all blue
[3939.80 - 3944.92] P:1662.65 E:0.094791 |  kit with the red trim, looked to play it down the line. This is for a run of Schrantz but that is
[3944.92 - 3949.96] P:1662.63 E:0.099684 |  seen behind by Phil Foden for a goal kick. So the Slovakia team unchanged from their previous
[3949.96 - 3955.48] P:1625.25 E:0.099128 |  match Dubravka Ringel, Peckery Vavro, Strinja and Hansko, then Kutska, Lovotka and Duda the
[3956.12 - 3962.36] P:1595.64 E:0.091552 |  central three. Schrantz the goal scorer on the right, Haraslín on the left and Stralets up front.
[3962.36 - 3967.32] P:1609.73 E:0.097816 |  World Service listeners are back with us here on Five Live. Listeners well if you're on the move on
[3967.32 - 3972.84] P:1601.78 E:0.094166 |  BBC sounds. Remember you can listen back as well by a sound to any of our commentaries from the
[3972.84 - 3979.08] P:1532.55 E:0.091757 |  Euros. If England turn this round this might be one of them. Here's Meynu, Meynu now out towards
[3979.08 - 3984.68] P:1513.80 E:0.089187 |  the right hand side to Walker and then Walker pulls it back. Matt Upsons just to my left here. What do
[3985.00 - 3989.32] P:1635.62 E:0.108340 |  you want to see most from England now Matt? I just want to see us move the ball quicker.
[3989.96 - 3994.12] P:1744.70 E:0.104165 |  It's so slow in the build up. I know we're talking about having a lot of possession but
[3994.12 - 3999.32] P:1567.33 E:0.090322 |  it's just sat with Declan Rice. Slovakia have got all their players behind the ball. They're set,
[3999.32 - 4003.56] P:1578.74 E:0.088868 |  they're in shape, they're ready to defend as a unit. We need to catch them when they're out of
[4003.56 - 4006.92] P:1530.64 E:0.106369 |  position and move them around a little bit and you've got to do that by moving it quickly,
[4006.92 - 4012.52] P:1499.49 E:0.095632 |  John. It can't be slow, methodical build up all the time. They're too good at organised team
[4012.52 - 4018.20] P:1251.76 E:0.100193 |  to break down. It's much harder to break down a set unit than if you can move in that position
[4018.20 - 4023.24] P:1410.57 E:0.097327 |  with quick play. Matt Upsons next to me. Joe Hart's here as well. Izzy Christensen down at
[4023.24 - 4028.68] P:1532.88 E:0.096804 |  touch line. Saka there. Very tight hands go with the challenge out of play for a throwing
[4028.68 - 4033.40] P:1486.14 E:0.099628 |  to Slovakia. Now Mark Gay is able to give it back to Pickford on the edge of the area. I'm sure there
[4033.40 - 4038.60] P:1439.19 E:0.097736 |  will be a clamour. Joe for Kul Parma to get him on the field. However, if he does play on the right,
[4038.60 - 4042.20] P:1343.36 E:0.097121 |  Saka has actually been one of England's more effective players as the ball's headed back
[4042.20 - 4047.88] P:1324.58 E:0.103263 |  towards the halfway line for Slovakia. Duda is able to take it away there, then Bellingham puts
[4047.88 - 4053.80] P:1429.28 E:0.110021 |  the challenge in and deflects it out for a throw. Yeah, Saka's look good, but he's in a battle.
[4053.80 - 4058.76] P:1404.05 E:0.110697 |  That's for sure. It's been tough down that side. Some early moments towards the end as well.
[4059.40 - 4062.52] P:1451.83 E:0.111178 |  As England look to get on the press here, obviously it's going to get a little bit
[4062.52 - 4066.12] P:1427.40 E:0.110866 |  excitable in the next couple of minutes if England don't score and don't take a grip of this game.
[4066.12 - 4071.72] P:1361.49 E:0.108363 |  So there will be a clamour, but Gareth proved all along that how he does things.
[4071.80 - 4074.28] P:1336.72 E:0.113728 |  He's not going to be forced into anything, so let's see how this plays out.
[4075.00 - 4080.92] P:1346.01 E:0.109157 |  Time ticking away on England. One nil down, folded after Rice won a free kick.
[4081.88 - 4090.52] P:1518.59 E:0.106389 |  Rice again. England go backwards once more. Now John Stones. Stones, as we see this press again
[4090.52 - 4096.76] P:1518.60 E:0.099394 |  from Slovakia, it is so effective, forcing England right back to the edge of their own penalty area.
[4096.76 - 4102.28] P:1542.59 E:0.106724 |  Stones used to be in very comfortable in possession with Manchester City. Declan Rice is just
[4102.28 - 4107.40] P:1564.35 E:0.097676 |  outside his own box. There's the pass back to Pickford. Short pass to John Stones,
[4108.04 - 4113.24] P:1460.89 E:0.105202 |  and then Bellingham comes short, but again it's square out towards the right-hand side to Kyle
[4113.24 - 4119.16] P:1378.58 E:0.099675 |  Walker. Back to John Stones again on the edge of the box. England fans inside this ground,
[4119.16 - 4124.76] P:1503.85 E:0.098103 |  thousands of them. They'll be sitting rather nervously watching this as Walker comes forward
[4124.76 - 4130.92] P:1576.29 E:0.107935 |  and uses the pass to Saka. Saka now in field to Kane. Kane first time touch. Lovely pass.
[4130.92 - 4136.76] P:1774.61 E:0.112781 |  Trippier could be in on his left foot across, it comes in from Foden. There's no flag.
[4137.88 - 4144.28] P:1531.50 E:0.116256 |  Foden turns it in, and England equalise. Five minutes into the second half, they're back on
[4144.28 - 4151.48] P:1456.59 E:0.108964 |  level terms, and it all came from the pass from Harry Kane. Trippier then Foden with the final
[4151.48 - 4157.72] P:1595.87 E:0.116886 |  touch, and it's England once for Vakia 1. Well, Phil Foden keeps his discipline here, keeps his
[4157.72 - 4164.04] P:1814.80 E:0.113882 |  wick really well. It's great play from Kane, he recedes the ball, sees the opening wide,
[4164.04 - 4169.16] P:1636.18 E:0.103752 |  and it's just really unselfish play. It's good build-up. For the first time in the game,
[4169.16 - 4177.16] P:1642.72 E:0.104679 |  really do stretch the Vakia. The wick is there, and the tap in is in, but there's a real chance
[4177.16 - 4180.76] P:1775.54 E:0.100798 |  that this is going to be offside. I think that I felt it at the time, I'll be honest, that I felt
[4180.76 - 4188.12] P:1721.66 E:0.100356 |  offside. He's drifted just in front. I mean, he's Trippier with the wick. He's on that left-hand
[4188.12 - 4194.04] P:1726.17 E:0.094049 |  side, but he certainly looks comfortably offside, Joe. I think Slovakia, they looked on their
[4194.04 - 4198.76] P:1832.08 E:0.113321 |  knees there. They looked like... Yeah, goals ruled out. That's a big moment, that's a huge moment in
[4198.76 - 4202.52] P:1786.71 E:0.108540 |  the game. That's going to give them energy. I felt like Slovakia felt, you know what, we've done
[4202.52 - 4207.48] P:1713.55 E:0.104203 |  okay, but this is going to be tough now. Yeah, really disappointing to see. The goals ruled out,
[4207.48 - 4216.92] P:1669.75 E:0.096415 |  it remains England-nil, Slovakia won. A clear decision. And Phil Forden after the big celebration,
[4217.56 - 4222.04] P:1606.14 E:0.101293 |  well, that is caught in his throats and the throats of the England fans. Down to pitchside,
[4222.04 - 4233.08] P:1451.03 E:0.100837 |  is he Christensen? Okay, we'll see if we can make contact with Izzy in a moment,
[4233.16 - 4239.80] P:1602.12 E:0.095515 |  that it is a free kick as a result that is taken by Dubravka. So that's another goal England
[4239.80 - 4243.40] P:1615.09 E:0.109289 |  have had ruled out for offside. England come again though with Kane into the penalty area
[4243.40 - 4249.72] P:1646.17 E:0.107591 |  against Skriniar. Kane with a chance deflected, or deflected wide. It did look as though the ball
[4249.72 - 4255.24] P:1611.35 E:0.105036 |  was going to drop into the net from our position up here, but instead that touch did take it away
[4255.24 - 4261.24] P:1314.06 E:0.106983 |  from goal wide of goal of Favreau's right instead. It's a corner, man. It was so hard to see whether
[4261.24 - 4265.88] P:1457.31 E:0.101047 |  that was going to drop cruelly into the near post of the Slovakian goal there as the ball
[4265.88 - 4270.84] P:1450.47 E:0.103331 |  deflected up in there. Loads of spin on it, it bounces and it just goes wider that post.
[4270.84 - 4275.64] P:1360.31 E:0.102979 |  Here's the corner, this from Trivia, pushed away by Dubravka almost on the goal line underneath
[4275.64 - 4282.44] P:1439.22 E:0.092684 |  the crossbar and back to Walker in the centre circle. Walker has a look forward that the option
[4282.44 - 4287.88] P:1549.82 E:0.099337 |  was Kobe Maneu, so it goes back to Jordan Pickford, the goalkeeper who it's a long pass that
[4287.88 - 4291.56] P:1522.74 E:0.107953 |  actually Trivia is going to do well. He does chest it down, played in field,
[4291.56 - 4296.28] P:1455.68 E:0.101250 |  Clodin, but Clodin is challenged by Lobodka and England go back into their own path.
[4296.28 - 4300.84] P:1583.44 E:0.097510 |  I mean even though that goal's chalked off, it looks like it's given us a little bit of
[4300.84 - 4305.80] P:1634.12 E:0.100866 |  belief I have to say to know that we can break through. If we get one or two passes off and
[4305.80 - 4310.36] P:1619.96 E:0.097402 |  move the ball well, create the space, keep our width, all of a sudden there's an opportunity
[4310.36 - 4314.84] P:1510.24 E:0.095650 |  with Trivia all the way down the left and we have to keep hanging on to that. We've got to
[4314.84 - 4319.96] P:1517.59 E:0.100279 |  develop that belief, John, that we can move the ball past it cleanly and create that space
[4319.96 - 4327.16] P:1614.82 E:0.093398 |  and if we do we'll create chances. Well we are in the thick of a European championship knockout tie
[4327.16 - 4334.12] P:1711.25 E:0.094870 |  here, no question. England 1-0 down, striving to try and find an equaliser. Rice slips the ball
[4334.12 - 4340.44] P:1495.68 E:0.094744 |  forward, that's intercepted by a sliding doodah that puts it out of play for a throw for England
[4340.44 - 4344.28] P:1393.21 E:0.103416 |  on the far side in the second half. England attacking towards the end where the Slovakia
[4344.28 - 4350.60] P:1422.31 E:0.101142 |  fans are, they've been in great spirit. A throwing that is taken by Walker, Kane controls it on the
[4350.60 - 4355.16] P:1514.26 E:0.101333 |  edge of the box, Kane works it back to Saka, Saka pulls it across but cleared away by Fabro,
[4355.16 - 4361.40] P:1436.38 E:0.101006 |  comes back out to England though, Manu, tests it down Manu, then back to Rice, Slovakia got
[4361.40 - 4366.76] P:1541.68 E:0.096945 |  everyone back behind the ball. In their matches, they've been looking back at them, you know when
[4366.76 - 4375.40] P:1405.76 E:0.097109 |  teams put pressure on them, you can get at them but England straining for the breakthrough,
[4376.12 - 4381.96] P:1331.17 E:0.104265 |  Trippia can't reach that and it is cleared up the lane but that just gives possession back to
[4381.96 - 4385.96] P:1515.50 E:0.109051 |  England. Yeah I mean they are struggling a bit, I have to say they can't keep hold of the ball
[4385.96 - 4391.00] P:1553.60 E:0.095775 |  Slovakia, their coach Calzone is just shouting at the players to try and get up the pitch but you
[4391.00 - 4395.08] P:1516.94 E:0.095109 |  need to have the ball if you want to get up the pitch because England now will have another
[4395.16 - 4400.12] P:1592.05 E:0.106128 |  patient build up and a wave of attacks will come and you just feel they will start to tire and
[4400.12 - 4405.72] P:1578.96 E:0.104237 |  holes will start to appear. 1-0 Slovakia lead if you've just got into your car,
[4406.52 - 4410.68] P:1561.50 E:0.104468 |  England are heading out, they're going out here in the round of 16 with this score line,
[4411.40 - 4415.32] P:1485.66 E:0.103099 |  here's Walker on the right hand side, Walker is tripped, that's a free kick,
[4415.32 - 4420.76] P:1431.70 E:0.102854 |  free kick ten yards inside the Slovak territory and we would have Slovakia as Slovak, oh
[4420.76 - 4424.92] P:1796.95 E:0.110488 |  they've taken the free kick quickly, Pickford's going to struggle to get there and it bounces
[4424.92 - 4431.48] P:1708.87 E:0.092226 |  wide, the shot from Strelitz in the centre circle, quick free kick, Storns and Bellingham
[4432.04 - 4436.44] P:1687.94 E:0.101192 |  and Meen who were nowhere near it and Strelitz went for goal through the centre circle and very
[4436.44 - 4443.16] P:1702.55 E:0.086249 |  nearly scored. Goodness me what a disaster that really actually should have been because if Strelitz
[4443.16 - 4448.36] P:1470.71 E:0.096158 |  has any quality with his left foot it's not a difficult chance to convert from that race John,
[4448.36 - 4453.80] P:1627.72 E:0.096486 |  he had the whole goal to Amat, it didn't have to be inch perfect the shot, he should hit the
[4453.80 - 4458.12] P:1614.05 E:0.096101 |  target, that should be a goal, he's so sloppy from England. Guys this is where you earn your money,
[4458.12 - 4462.20] P:1610.89 E:0.104327 |  how on earth do you explain that on the radio, that is almost impossible to explain what's just
[4462.20 - 4467.72] P:1577.62 E:0.101907 |  gone on there, it was it was sloppy play, John Storns not aware of a short pass being made to him.
[4467.72 - 4471.72] P:1570.10 E:0.101194 |  Pickford goes for a long pass, Trippier I don't think they'll get there and do a graph because they
[4471.72 - 4474.84] P:1597.92 E:0.110484 |  would have taken it up on the end of the year. It was a very nonchalant pass though Joe, wasn't it?
[4474.84 - 4477.72] P:1679.80 E:0.099506 |  It wasn't the clear I'm taking this free kick and I'm going to pass it to you.
[4477.72 - 4481.48] P:1448.00 E:0.090285 |  It's the wavelengths that we're talking about that were just not quite on and that
[4482.36 - 4486.04] P:1589.41 E:0.099830 |  sloppy isn't it? Jordan Pickford's heart must have been racing, look at him there,
[4486.04 - 4491.16] P:1516.61 E:0.093539 |  he's taken some deep breaths, he was chasing back to goal thinking I'm dead here, this is a huge
[4491.16 - 4494.20] P:1409.48 E:0.095278 |  moment. I think if that falls to one of the midfield three that's in the back of the net
[4494.20 - 4497.24] P:1595.52 E:0.090341 |  because they'd have the quality to hit the target with that, he should score.
[4497.24 - 4502.92] P:1672.40 E:0.108262 |  It was an escape for England most certainly and I think Joe Hart is a very recently retired goalkeeper
[4503.88 - 4508.44] P:1736.09 E:0.098334 |  that must have really brought back the memories as Trippier plays it in field towards Rice in
[4508.44 - 4513.72] P:1622.77 E:0.098730 |  the centre circle. Rice goes for one of his passes, trademark passes, struck it well to Saka.
[4513.72 - 4517.80] P:1655.02 E:0.098595 |  How many times has he done that this season for his club and then Saka takes on the defender,
[4517.80 - 4521.48] P:1638.54 E:0.102782 |  still going, there are two of them there then cuts back onto his left foot and actually
[4521.48 - 4526.52] P:1598.38 E:0.106509 |  hands good as well and hands good, he's giving it away under pressure from Saka, then Manu
[4526.52 - 4531.32] P:1532.21 E:0.097505 |  to Foden, Manu, Manu's still going, there's the ball to the right hand side to Walker,
[4531.32 - 4536.68] P:1625.42 E:0.098923 |  Walker cuts it back to Foden, Foden, his ball into the area left foot, it's plain challenging for it,
[4536.68 - 4541.56] P:1421.82 E:0.099223 |  that was headed away though by Peccarique on the edge of the six yard box, this is good pressure
[4541.56 - 4547.24] P:1483.27 E:0.104580 |  from England but we've already played 10 minutes in the second half and the equaliser has not come
[4547.24 - 4552.44] P:1534.22 E:0.092757 |  even though England have had the ball in the net as they did in the previous match against Slovenia
[4552.44 - 4559.80] P:1453.05 E:0.102806 |  but from an offside position. The ball just hasn't stuck as well to Harry Kane as what you'd expect
[4559.88 - 4564.44] P:1611.52 E:0.104252 |  in this game, a couple of loose touches, it's not really going into him and he's holding it,
[4564.44 - 4565.80] P:1523.15 E:0.099572 |  he's bringing players into play.
[4566.92 - 4574.60] P:1591.52 E:0.096693 |  Trepia, then to Manu, John Stones, forward of the centre circle, Stones rolls the ball out
[4574.60 - 4581.40] P:1541.83 E:0.100848 |  towards Walker on the right hand side, Walker taking on Haraslín, Saka comes short, there's Foden
[4581.40 - 4585.16] P:1503.08 E:0.101950 |  over towards the right hand side, Foden's ball in, he's looking for Kane, in fact it's Bellingen
[4586.12 - 4591.16] P:1482.62 E:0.105501 |  under pressure from the defender Peccarique who goes down in a heap and Bellingen has said
[4591.16 - 4595.72] P:1623.71 E:0.105765 |  something there to Peccarique and Dubravka's pointed that out to the referee and Jude Bellingen
[4595.72 - 4600.20] P:1661.53 E:0.094809 |  is on a yellow card but the referee is going to take no further action although he turns,
[4600.20 - 4605.48] P:1501.01 E:0.091682 |  Harry Kane is there or thereabouts as well as the captain. I think Bellingen knows that Peccarique
[4605.48 - 4609.64] P:1446.44 E:0.096427 |  is experienced enough to be buying time here, they're under masses of pressure here,
[4609.64 - 4614.44] P:1407.31 E:0.090241 |  Slovakia, there's a challenge from Bellingen, he knows he hasn't caught him but Peccarique goes down
[4614.44 - 4619.56] P:1399.56 E:0.089630 |  on a heap on the floor just to take this thing out of the game, slow the pace down which there has
[4619.56 - 4625.40] P:1357.50 E:0.091312 |  happened and then now restart the game and Bellingen has to be careful, he just doesn't get, go too
[4625.40 - 4631.08] P:1554.65 E:0.099828 |  far shall we say in terms of expressing that. Yeah if England lost a man now, if they went down to 10
[4631.08 - 4638.36] P:1599.72 E:0.099946 |  then I think you can begin to make plans for the playing home. Slovakia look tired guys,
[4638.36 - 4642.76] P:1548.92 E:0.100264 |  they look really tired, they look like they're hanging on and it's very early in the game to
[4642.76 - 4647.56] P:1579.49 E:0.103989 |  be hanging on with the quality of England they have got. And actually that coach Calzona is going
[4647.56 - 4651.80] P:1653.73 E:0.089334 |  to make a couple of changes so it's actually Slovakia who are going to make the changes first as the
[4651.80 - 4657.64] P:1525.34 E:0.100214 |  ball has flicked forward but Gage's able to. Well he's had five substitutes quite vigorously warming
[4657.64 - 4662.52] P:1394.62 E:0.105614 |  up down to the right hand side for ever since that they came out for the second half so I should
[4662.52 - 4668.44] P:1485.52 E:0.111228 |  imagine he needs fresh legs as well and there's two getting stripped. Yeah Suslov is going to come on
[4668.52 - 4674.68] P:1589.01 E:0.103945 |  and also Boženik up front, here's Bellingen through the middle, lovely change of feet again
[4674.68 - 4679.24] P:1556.61 E:0.102100 |  from right to left then it opens up from through the middle in fact he gives it square to Declan
[4679.24 - 4685.40] P:1561.79 E:0.108193 |  Reis, Menu, England still one nil down, Trippia on the right, Trippia curls it in, headed away well
[4685.40 - 4691.88] P:1526.88 E:0.095058 |  by Skriniar, excellent header from the Paris Saint-Germain player, comes out to Reis, Reis is able to
[4691.88 - 4697.56] P:1545.28 E:0.102742 |  give it to Menu, Menu now to the left hand side, Trippia back centrally to Koby Menu,
[4697.56 - 4703.40] P:1588.00 E:0.107470 |  Walker makes a run in fact the pass goes square to Reis, back square again to Menu, Menu is going
[4703.40 - 4709.96] P:1620.69 E:0.111052 |  to take it on himself into the penalty area where he's reaching it down by Kutska and Kutska is on
[4709.96 - 4717.64] P:1524.81 E:0.097160 |  a yellow card you know in the match. Well he's got to be careful I mean he just takes Menu's back leg
[4717.64 - 4722.68] P:1415.68 E:0.092930 |  as he goes past him but this is all about the decision making from Koby Menu, he gets the ball
[4722.68 - 4727.88] P:1554.88 E:0.096937 |  he sees a tiny hole and he thinks right I'm going to go for it, he drives with it really quickly,
[4727.88 - 4733.16] P:1499.36 E:0.088875 |  gets the drop on Kutska, he'll have to slide in and just wipe him out, he is quite fortunate
[4733.16 - 4739.64] P:1439.24 E:0.088690 |  John I mean it isn't a second yellow offence but it's on the edge isn't it? So free kick to England,
[4740.20 - 4746.36] P:1616.84 E:0.095513 |  Kieran Trippia who's not scored for England since the World Cup semi-final in Moscow back in 2018
[4747.08 - 4750.60] P:1648.48 E:0.106495 |  I thought it might be Kane from this angle you'd have thought that Kane would have
[4751.32 - 4757.56] P:1551.71 E:0.105765 |  yeah but clearly Trippia is the there's the choice although Foden is there as well with the left
[4757.56 - 4761.64] P:1479.94 E:0.105571 |  foot but you would think that Trippia would have to go for goal here. You'd think so I mean it's a great
[4761.64 - 4768.68] P:1601.51 E:0.094369 |  angle and the distance is very good it's about probably seven or eight yards outside of the
[4768.68 - 4773.72] P:1803.44 E:0.106909 |  the penalty box but it's just to the left hand side so it's perfect for a right footer. Well how
[4773.72 - 4781.24] P:1822.33 E:0.105647 |  many times will Kieran Trippia have practiced this free kick against Martin Dubravka? Is clubmate
[4782.20 - 4787.88] P:1638.46 E:0.110231 |  Foden to the right of the ball it's actually Foden into the wall and advances away to the
[4787.88 - 4793.40] P:1592.49 E:0.096011 |  halfway line and Trippia actually recovers it and then plays a right footed ball for the
[4793.40 - 4797.40] P:1612.74 E:0.109005 |  advances all the way through for a goal kick. I'll try to be a little bit clever there maybe it's
[4797.40 - 4802.44] P:1742.60 E:0.102520 |  interesting tack because Foden with his left foot takes it they're trying to catch Dubravka out
[4802.44 - 4806.44] P:1670.22 E:0.099065 |  because I think they're feeling Dubravka really does feel that Trippia is going to take it
[4806.44 - 4809.88] P:1577.40 E:0.107562 |  and he's trying to bend it into that near post area but not high enough over the wall.
[4811.56 - 4820.12] P:1680.02 E:0.096339 |  So Slovakia now make these two changes and Thomas Susloff of Verona is going to come on to replace
[4820.12 - 4828.12] P:1530.81 E:0.086051 |  Haras Linn who has faded in the game it must be said so the number seven will come on for him
[4828.20 - 4834.76] P:1447.31 E:0.094639 |  over on the left hand side as there is also Strelitz is down I think he's coming off anyway
[4834.76 - 4844.12] P:1574.08 E:0.096824 |  isn't he? Yeah yeah to be replaced by Robert Buzh is down to pitch side is he Christensen?
[4844.92 - 4849.00] P:1702.93 E:0.099918 |  Hello up there Joe's called it hasn't he the Slovakians are getting tired and
[4849.00 - 4853.88] P:1697.23 E:0.101347 |  they're responding I want to see England respond but I'm just watching the fans and the contrast
[4853.88 - 4859.48] P:1571.80 E:0.095920 |  between the the celebrations when Foden found the back of the net and then the feeling afterwards
[4859.48 - 4864.28] P:1622.74 E:0.100733 |  when VAR choked it off they're getting increasingly frustrated and I can really feel it transmitting
[4864.28 - 4868.12] P:1510.71 E:0.096489 |  out here down to me and then on to the pitch and they've got to keep their heads and let's hope for
[4868.12 - 4874.92] P:1518.28 E:0.082777 |  some fresh legs in that England front line. Well we are now into the last half hour so when are the
[4874.92 - 4880.20] P:1626.70 E:0.087608 |  England subs going to come? Well I'm just looking at them on the big screen warming up they're down
[4880.20 - 4884.52] P:1486.69 E:0.096117 |  there on the touch line going through their paces and looking at Oli Watkins Gallagher
[4885.64 - 4893.24] P:1538.42 E:0.089394 |  I very much say Eze is down there as well and I think we will surely see somebody soon but I'm not
[4893.24 - 4899.72] P:1676.01 E:0.094367 |  surprised that the centre forward who's just gone off Strelitz I mean he looked tired after 15 minutes
[4899.72 - 4903.88] P:1684.74 E:0.092871 |  he's lasted an hour and he has put a shift in. I think it's forward pass for us all the way through
[4903.88 - 4908.36] P:1764.87 E:0.111240 |  to De Braf goes looking for Foden it's over armed out that could have been given away by Trippia
[4908.36 - 4912.84] P:1688.60 E:0.098697 |  got their defender Peckery did well Rice takes it on down the left hand side Rice comes through
[4912.84 - 4916.84] P:1459.67 E:0.103953 |  the challenge his ball into the box bounces all the way through to De Braf go in Trippia
[4916.84 - 4922.44] P:1343.41 E:0.101080 |  has stayed down there and he's saying he's got a problem so De Braf has put the ball out of play
[4923.24 - 4929.32] P:1377.98 E:0.094922 |  it was full body weight into his kind of shin or ankle I mean he's kicking the floor here in
[4929.32 - 4935.08] P:1364.08 E:0.090213 |  Trippia's holding his right leg but he overran the ball there Peckerych and when he goes in for
[4935.08 - 4940.20] P:1344.48 E:0.092615 |  tackle he actually catches him really nastily it's a bad tackle that's a bad tackle yeah that
[4940.20 - 4945.24] P:1481.41 E:0.096974 |  really is I mean he gets a little bit of the ball but kind of by chance Joe he's got ricochets and
[4945.24 - 4950.36] P:1433.35 E:0.092218 |  hits him he doesn't actually win the ball with the tackle he makes contact after his kick Trippia
[4951.08 - 4955.64] P:1546.43 E:0.095119 |  I can't make sense of the rhythm of the referee no we don't want to be sat up here talk about
[4955.64 - 4959.56] P:1582.71 E:0.100167 |  referees but his rhythm in his decision making I thought the free kick on the edge of the area
[4960.52 - 4964.12] P:1631.51 E:0.093125 |  obviously on a yellow card it's tough to give a second yellow card but there's just no consistency
[4964.68 - 4970.44] P:1636.87 E:0.088692 |  but England in the ascendancy the threats there obviously I know everyone will be clamouring
[4970.44 - 4973.48] P:1673.07 E:0.095321 |  for a change but I think the boys that are on the pitch at the moment actually looking very
[4973.48 - 4978.60] P:1603.16 E:0.094809 |  settled in this game getting some rhythm to it like we say we're looking at the subs that are
[4978.60 - 4982.76] P:1737.45 E:0.101458 |  warming up at the moment they're not the ones that I think will be coming on yeah speaker that
[4982.76 - 4987.88] P:1764.08 E:0.106998 |  Cole Palmer stripped them ready to go yeah it's going to be Cole Palmer as the cheer the England
[4987.88 - 4993.88] P:1779.79 E:0.105884 |  fans behind the the dugout there they get to their feet they start applauding that's the
[4993.88 - 4999.24] P:1659.82 E:0.104520 |  last thing you need to see if you're a Slovakian player oh yes oh wow a tiring team with Palmer
[4999.24 - 5004.52] P:1747.88 E:0.106508 |  coming on but who's coming off? Vukaiyo Saka has been called across by Garrett Southgate
[5006.12 - 5011.88] P:1665.20 E:0.100867 |  Mark Gay it is who's been called across Trippia is is just climbing to his feet I think it is
[5011.96 - 5016.68] P:1583.35 E:0.096302 |  Saka who's going to come off yeah he's being spoken to isn't he by by Declan Rice I'm not sure
[5016.68 - 5021.56] P:1640.96 E:0.097708 |  I mean Declan Rice is having a real word in his ear whether or not he's shifting position or he is
[5021.56 - 5026.68] P:1527.37 E:0.085499 |  going to come off well Saka runs over to this side of the field Garrett Southgate's going to speak
[5026.68 - 5030.44] P:1547.93 E:0.103210 |  to him we won't see the change yet I mean I'm not I'm not sure if Trippia can continue I think Saka's
[5030.44 - 5034.52] P:1483.90 E:0.089801 |  going to go to left back John okay Saka's dropping dropping into the left back position
[5034.52 - 5039.56] P:1571.02 E:0.093750 |  I'm going to see Saka at left well he is for now and now now Trippia's back on the field but I think
[5039.56 - 5043.24] P:1638.78 E:0.097424 |  they're waiting to see if Kieran Trippia can actually continue because he's hobbling along
[5044.04 - 5050.36] P:1609.60 E:0.103760 |  England nil Slovakia one time beginning to run out as Bellingham has tackled and now here's the
[5050.36 - 5055.48] P:1648.38 E:0.096250 |  newly arrived Bosjanik Bosjanik the the number nine who started the first two matches at the
[5055.48 - 5062.04] P:1567.29 E:0.091372 |  tournament for Slovakia little ball forward now to the right hand side where it's played in by
[5062.04 - 5068.92] P:1558.25 E:0.096533 |  Schrantz the goal scorer now Gouda receives it 35 yards out left hand side in comes the cross
[5068.92 - 5073.72] P:1696.09 E:0.110245 |  from Hansko into the penalty area right struggling to get it away just gets there first and his
[5073.72 - 5081.00] P:1621.70 E:0.103167 |  foul as well on the edge of the box and it's helped to his feet by Kruzka that's another that's another
[5081.00 - 5088.52] P:1752.36 E:0.106460 |  foul by Kruzka he's making a free end and here's the change and it's going to be Trippia off yep
[5088.52 - 5096.60] P:1735.05 E:0.101230 |  not able to continue so this is going to be Bukaya Saka at left back it is it is and I totally
[5097.08 - 5101.80] P:1650.78 E:0.107917 |  understand the change I mean Deccan Rice was having quite a word with him he took some information
[5101.80 - 5107.72] P:1770.22 E:0.099372 |  on board from Garisalve gate went across had a long discussion with his arson teammate and Saka
[5107.72 - 5112.84] P:1640.37 E:0.092732 |  is now next to Mark Gehrhe in that left back position but he just saw the benefit of fresh legs
[5112.84 - 5117.96] P:1556.72 E:0.095875 |  for Slovakia it was Bosjanik that just robbed the ball off for Jude Bellingham a moment ago and
[5117.96 - 5122.84] P:1666.59 E:0.086505 |  just that ejection of energy is that they've desperately needed that the Slovaks and whether
[5122.84 - 5127.08] P:1594.86 E:0.094858 |  or not that'll help them defend this lead we'll have to wait and see but they've certainly got a
[5127.08 - 5133.00] P:1686.94 E:0.104403 |  bit more legs in the team now England Nils Slovakia won five live in the world service from the BBC
[5133.00 - 5139.48] P:1644.26 E:0.096187 |  Spain against Georgia to come tonight on five live as Deccan Rice off winside his own half
[5139.48 - 5146.04] P:1517.53 E:0.098039 |  will play the ball to the right hand side and stones now picks out a pass to Palmer involved
[5146.04 - 5149.72] P:1545.38 E:0.096379 |  for the first time the Chelsea man the Premier League young player of the season
[5150.20 - 5156.28] P:1574.27 E:0.101313 |  back it goes from him to John Stones stones his former teammate at Manchester City
[5158.20 - 5164.76] P:1493.91 E:0.098938 |  as Koby Manu receives it from him and England well the England fans want to see them on the
[5164.76 - 5170.92] P:1638.59 E:0.104145 |  front foot here they're up against this tiring Slovakia team but still the goal won't come the
[5170.92 - 5176.12] P:1693.25 E:0.093455 |  equaliser and actually England have got it in their own half Palmer has been forced to to carry it
[5176.20 - 5181.72] P:1577.92 E:0.102840 |  there and now gives it to gay gay's been put under pressure he has been fouled by Trance
[5181.72 - 5185.80] P:1578.30 E:0.107932 |  for it's brilliant pressure at this stage of the game from Trance to be that high on care he's
[5185.80 - 5190.52] P:1582.13 E:0.090224 |  touched but England have picked up a quite interesting format it's a bit of a 4-1-4-1 now
[5190.52 - 5196.52] P:1587.66 E:0.080840 |  he's got kind of Bellingham Palmer Foden all the way along Harry Kane higher up the pitch
[5196.52 - 5202.60] P:1702.60 E:0.096104 |  Sackers advancing quite the way up as well it's really having to throw everything at it as you'd
[5202.60 - 5206.92] P:1611.63 E:0.094230 |  expect at this stage in the game 23 minutes or so left and England desperate for a goal
[5208.12 - 5214.60] P:1534.82 E:0.099705 |  England facing an exit at the last 16 unless they can come up with something
[5214.60 - 5220.60] P:1558.04 E:0.101707 |  it's the first time since Euro 2016 the famous infamous defeat against Iceland this would be
[5220.60 - 5224.76] P:1609.44 E:0.103943 |  considered I'm sure on a par but I think that would be to underestimate this Slovakia team
[5225.40 - 5230.92] P:1714.14 E:0.101829 |  Rice Rice now there's a Slovakian player down on the far side here is Saka now playing as the
[5230.92 - 5236.36] P:1849.05 E:0.108549 |  left back Rice goes for a big Trossfield pass this is for Palmer Palmer takes it down on his left
[5236.36 - 5241.00] P:1779.66 E:0.108642 |  instead Bellingham's there with him Palmer's ball in Foden tried to get his head to it but it was
[5241.00 - 5246.04] P:1738.45 E:0.113550 |  blocked by Vapro and deflected way to goal for corner you cannot give Cole Palmer that kind of
[5246.04 - 5251.24] P:1723.76 E:0.113913 |  space coming inside on his left foot he will find the perfect pass and that was just a shame
[5251.24 - 5256.20] P:1588.50 E:0.103545 |  Phil Foden didn't make any contact with the ball he got the distance off the centre back
[5256.20 - 5260.68] P:1520.23 E:0.107262 |  it just needed a glance in header would have caused the Brafka a real problem
[5261.24 - 5265.48] P:1698.61 E:0.097090 |  and he just didn't make any contact and it ricochets up in the air one of the first time
[5265.48 - 5269.56] P:1617.23 E:0.100342 |  the two centre backs have been caught out with a crossing to the box Foden to take this corner
[5269.56 - 5274.28] P:1554.31 E:0.104649 |  for England standing in front of all of the Slovak flags Foden's ball into the near post that's headed
[5274.28 - 5282.28] P:1347.88 E:0.096924 |  up and away effectively as well by Bozjanik who's just come on and then back to the halfway line
[5282.36 - 5288.12] P:1600.07 E:0.097918 |  it goes and England will have to start again we are now into the final quarter of the match here
[5288.12 - 5293.64] P:1553.51 E:0.103036 |  in Gelsenkirk and England with Foden is still on the right flank after taking that corner
[5293.64 - 5300.52] P:1457.23 E:0.100764 |  he holds the ball up chest puffed out then his passing field towards the number four Declan Rice
[5301.08 - 5305.64] P:1579.13 E:0.103829 |  Rice skips away from a couple of challenges takes it away from the Botker again Foden left
[5305.64 - 5309.80] P:1506.64 E:0.106190 |  foot ball into the back post but that's beyond and over the top of Harry Payne and it's through
[5309.80 - 5315.24] P:1484.43 E:0.101671 |  for Goldkirk yeah not the best if Cross is in from Foden just kind of floats it really it's not
[5315.24 - 5319.96] P:1337.90 E:0.093195 |  got a lot of intent drops back onto his left foot Kane peels for the back to post Bellingham's
[5319.96 - 5325.40] P:1257.98 E:0.099064 |  running the near post but I mean I have to say Slovakia defensively in terms of the Crosses
[5325.40 - 5331.40] P:1392.29 E:0.100269 |  this is I mean I haven't seen two centre backs enjoying defending the bots as much as this in
[5331.40 - 5335.24] P:1462.52 E:0.109031 |  a long long time Joe has been outstanding as they've edited it really well as a goalkeeper's
[5335.24 - 5340.76] P:1426.03 E:0.100729 |  perspective to feel that and see that it has to be so precise for us to get inside and someone
[5340.76 - 5344.76] P:1511.87 E:0.093070 |  get a chance near post they're taking they're taking hold of everything they're meeting it as
[5344.76 - 5347.96] P:1655.97 E:0.116287 |  high as point and really really getting rid of it I think the only chance you've got to beat in them
[5347.96 - 5352.04] P:1651.62 E:0.096999 |  is if a run is going to get across the face of them like that situation with Foden there you're not
[5352.04 - 5355.96] P:1640.65 E:0.093241 |  going to physically dominate them in the air today I think they're just they're just too good at that
[5355.96 - 5361.00] P:1596.58 E:0.092502 |  a hopeful cross no chance it needs to be you know concise and organised in what we're doing yeah
[5361.00 - 5367.24] P:1731.27 E:0.095429 |  that's Joe Hart and Matt Upson England internationals both up here in the commentary position
[5367.24 - 5372.04] P:1704.23 E:0.104600 |  Pecker Eakley very tired there when he miscontrolled the ball out England coming toward again
[5372.04 - 5375.96] P:1591.72 E:0.106664 |  Kane through the middle Palmer's available on the right there could be space here for England
[5375.96 - 5380.36] P:1788.79 E:0.108250 |  Palmer's ball across Bellingham with a touch the challenge in on him Bellingham works it back
[5380.36 - 5385.08] P:1662.01 E:0.098751 |  I'm not sure there was enough therefore a penalty even though the England fans want one now Rice back
[5385.08 - 5390.52] P:1539.77 E:0.096001 |  out to the right-hand side to Palmer suddenly he's creating the spark called Palmer as he's
[5390.52 - 5397.40] P:1485.49 E:0.105625 |  challenged but manages to shrug it off now Kobe Mino back to him Mino goes for the high ball
[5397.40 - 5402.36] P:1463.85 E:0.111142 |  into the penalty area that's hit overhead and it's caught by Dubravka I think I was a little bit naughty
[5402.36 - 5410.44] P:1563.63 E:0.100084 |  from Drew Bellingham that tries to con the referee it's a dive here should be simulation really John
[5410.44 - 5415.16] P:1502.15 E:0.100801 |  there's barely any contact he's going down before the contacts made he can see Kutsker who
[5415.16 - 5420.04] P:1513.41 E:0.103946 |  let's face it he's got about the pitch and kicking nearly everyone on it yeah today he's knowing that
[5420.04 - 5424.44] P:1563.69 E:0.093578 |  the contacts coming and he goes down and tries to win the penalty right right in front of the referee
[5424.44 - 5430.92] P:1588.27 E:0.087941 |  as well all the while there's the threat of a second goal for Slovakia Hans Cole as Slovakia
[5430.92 - 5435.32] P:1461.31 E:0.091131 |  move into England territory but then England forced them back into their own half that would have been
[5435.64 - 5441.88] P:1539.66 E:0.094985 |  big move from referee Mala that's a heavy back pass back to Dubravka to clear it away downfield
[5442.68 - 5448.12] P:1755.95 E:0.094340 |  onto the head of Kyle Walker and then stones back to to Pickford so Slovakia still leads through that
[5448.12 - 5455.16] P:1643.35 E:0.089974 |  goal from Ivan Schrantz in the 25th minute of the match they've been ahead it feels for a long
[5455.16 - 5461.88] P:1575.73 E:0.090597 |  long time England are on knocking on the door they've had the ball in the net Foden was offside
[5461.88 - 5467.32] P:1631.43 E:0.098753 |  now England here is Saka now on the left flank Saka infield towards Rice Dalingham makes a run
[5467.32 - 5472.12] P:1543.75 E:0.098389 |  through the middle but Rice goes over there to the far side with his pass to Parma Walker joins in
[5472.12 - 5479.40] P:1549.34 E:0.091574 |  in fact it's Manu who receives it Manu through the middle now to his left to Declan Rice Rice
[5480.12 - 5485.32] P:1864.16 E:0.112375 |  Foden on the left flank Foden has Saka there with him back it comes towards Rice again the whistles
[5485.32 - 5491.40] P:1792.36 E:0.103807 |  from the Slovakia fans that parked behind the ball Manu there's been forced away from the penalty area
[5492.52 - 5498.76] P:1791.57 E:0.114786 |  back it comes again to the Manchester United teenager now Declan Rice Rice with a forward
[5498.76 - 5503.32] P:1761.04 E:0.111621 |  pass towards Balingham Saka is there this is tricky for England to find a way through they need
[5503.32 - 5508.28] P:1644.58 E:0.108766 |  a bit of craft a bit of imagination maybe Balingham can provide it lovely turn away from the blocker
[5508.28 - 5512.36] P:1472.28 E:0.107264 |  Balingham then takes it down the left side into the box cuts back onto his right foot here's the
[5512.36 - 5517.24] P:1438.51 E:0.108330 |  cross and then Skriniar is there to head it away for Slovakia only back to the white shirts of England
[5517.64 - 5523.72] P:1477.07 E:0.112825 |  again this is this is a real cup tie feel to this England the favourites coming into this
[5524.36 - 5529.72] P:1439.72 E:0.107446 |  Slovakia the underdogs and in the classic cup tie scenario it's the underdogs who lead by one
[5529.72 - 5536.76] P:1415.25 E:0.098986 |  goal to Nel Foden and time running out for Garrett Southgate and his team in his 99th match
[5536.76 - 5541.88] P:1599.20 E:0.117526 |  in charge there's a big question now whether he'll make it to 100 a slow back player goes down
[5541.88 - 5546.52] P:1644.26 E:0.113843 |  England don't put the ball out of play Balingham then square towards Rice Rice through the middle
[5546.52 - 5551.56] P:1662.03 E:0.107397 |  but that just bounces back for Slovakia and they will bring it forward and actually do that
[5551.56 - 5559.24] P:1715.91 E:0.111592 |  there's going to pop it down and play so the physio can come on he can't blame them to be honest
[5559.24 - 5564.12] P:1706.53 E:0.095407 |  I mean this is all part of it it's the gamesmanship it's to know him what you need to he does actually
[5564.12 - 5569.88] P:1457.05 E:0.098766 |  really roll his ankle he's not faking it so there's a lot of booing going on around the stadium like
[5569.88 - 5575.24] P:1473.22 E:0.091888 |  he's just staying down but when he puts his foot down there he really does roll the ankle quite
[5575.32 - 5581.16] P:1338.04 E:0.090745 |  badly it's not not nice and it gets kicked out there's a chance for the players to break
[5581.16 - 5586.60] P:1541.79 E:0.095071 |  in Garrett Southgate just having a word with Mark Gehr here a couple of players but this is
[5586.60 - 5591.24] P:1430.48 E:0.107683 |  this is big-time stuff John this is this is a real it's on the line oh it's massively on the line
[5591.24 - 5597.16] P:1554.70 E:0.098636 |  listen to with Peckery the 37 year old right back Tiring I mean do we do you want to see
[5597.16 - 5602.68] P:1439.05 E:0.099485 |  Anthony Gordon running at him absolutely someone run run at him isolated but we've
[5602.68 - 5605.88] P:1531.02 E:0.104559 |  got to move the ball out there we've done it once on the goal and the space was there
[5606.52 - 5612.52] P:1448.75 E:0.100089 |  but it just hasn't happened often enough and my worry is is even though they are tired
[5613.72 - 5619.24] P:1438.38 E:0.100010 |  what this means to Slovakia to win this game against I mean they're going to find the strength
[5619.24 - 5623.64] P:1347.13 E:0.104500 |  they're going to find the energy to be able to to deal with it because they'll dig into the reserves
[5623.64 - 5628.76] P:1581.30 E:0.101365 |  it's such a big moment for them yeah they're World Cup or a European championship just the third
[5628.76 - 5633.00] P:1634.45 E:0.101164 |  time that they've been in a round of 16 and listen I'm not forgetting the fact that Slovakia
[5633.00 - 5637.80] P:1504.04 E:0.102108 |  as part of Czechoslovakia did actually win the thing back in 1976 and there were a majority
[5637.80 - 5645.88] P:1565.17 E:0.095437 |  of slow back players in that team but as Slovakia this would be so so special and to do it in the
[5645.88 - 5652.36] P:1636.94 E:0.098660 |  spirited way that they have well Suslov has received treatment so he's off the field for 30 seconds
[5652.44 - 5659.80] P:1448.59 E:0.098102 |  play resumes and we have now got only 15 minutes to play England 15 minutes from going out and
[5659.80 - 5665.56] P:1454.36 E:0.099715 |  this would be seen as an unmitigated failure in Garo Southgate's last tournament in charge
[5665.56 - 5672.28] P:1553.88 E:0.092686 |  but it's not over yet as Slovakia they come they're coming forward now whether they get a
[5672.28 - 5679.96] P:1564.56 E:0.087748 |  second goal that might be it and it is with Trance on the right hand side Trance back to
[5679.96 - 5686.52] P:1585.58 E:0.102869 |  Kutskja here is Lobotka Duda as well lovely touch Lobotka just so economically is just
[5687.16 - 5692.76] P:1673.39 E:0.102089 |  back to the halfway line Skriniya Lobotka under pressure from Rice Lobotka comes away with the
[5692.76 - 5699.00] P:1536.34 E:0.097499 |  ball brilliant I mean the low center of gravity allows him to adjust his angle and position so
[5699.00 - 5703.40] P:1578.84 E:0.093693 |  quickly and sharply I mean he's almost hovering waiting check in his shoulder see which angle
[5703.40 - 5708.28] P:1569.42 E:0.100549 |  Declan Rice is coming from he just pops the ball in the opposite direction gets his body in between
[5708.28 - 5712.92] P:1615.95 E:0.092803 |  Rice in the ball takes the contact and bang plays it I mean he has just been outstanding in this
[5712.92 - 5718.28] P:1602.02 E:0.101512 |  game feet wide apart and then there's a pass forward for a pick that to come out and pick up
[5718.28 - 5722.92] P:1692.54 E:0.104577 |  Joe like the ratty that low center of gravity very calm on the ball he realizes that no one's
[5722.92 - 5726.68] P:1585.20 E:0.098249 |  going to be able to just clip him and take him off guard if you wanted to knock him over you'd
[5726.68 - 5730.68] P:1524.68 E:0.103894 |  really have to hit him hard and with his low center of gravity and his height he's more than
[5730.68 - 5736.76] P:1688.29 E:0.089296 |  more times often going to get the foul yeah such quick feet as well he do well on the dance floor
[5737.24 - 5742.92] P:1458.96 E:0.101388 |  as gay hits a long pass over the top for Bellingham to chase Skriniya got to that and then cold
[5742.92 - 5747.32] P:1270.14 E:0.102815 |  Palmer without question he's the danger man just allows the ball to roll out of play he's brought
[5747.32 - 5751.88] P:1444.06 E:0.110443 |  something again to England he takes a quick throw to Bellingham who goes down rather easily from the
[5751.88 - 5756.60] P:1536.84 E:0.110689 |  challenge from Duda it's not giving us a free kick Bellingham trying to get up and Palmer's in there
[5756.60 - 5761.00] P:1608.78 E:0.106440 |  as well but Slovakia come out with the ball and it's played away downfield but that will just give
[5761.00 - 5766.12] P:1594.70 E:0.102939 |  possession back to England he looks very fatigued due to Bellingham I'm a little bit surprised he's
[5766.12 - 5770.20] P:1411.23 E:0.106436 |  still on the pitch to be honest he just looks tired and you can tell he's just he's falling over
[5770.20 - 5774.44] P:1381.30 E:0.107192 |  when he gets the ball just trying to win a free kick or a foul or something I don't think he's
[5774.44 - 5780.44] P:1692.67 E:0.114431 |  quite got the energy oh then Fordham is fouled by Techery the lovely exchange there by the way
[5780.44 - 5784.36] P:1542.98 E:0.096587 |  between Saka and Foden on the left wing you know that's what you get with the left footer
[5784.36 - 5790.04] P:1503.80 E:0.102362 |  in the Saka position that's a yellow card for Techery so free kick to England out on the left
[5790.04 - 5800.04] P:1311.01 E:0.109099 |  outside so the question would be if you see Bellingham tiring and he's only yellow card as well
[5800.04 - 5805.72] P:1455.65 E:0.103720 |  there's been a couple of nearish things from Bellingham is he the man who makes way to well
[5805.72 - 5810.60] P:1558.18 E:0.107320 |  Gordon is now being cheered and Ezra down there as well the two of them I think we will see them
[5810.60 - 5815.56] P:1596.74 E:0.105197 |  but time really is running out Fordham at the free kick in, game with a header down and wide
[5816.36 - 5821.88] P:1486.58 E:0.097075 |  from eight yards out it was slightly behind him he got his head to it but couldn't direct it into
[5821.88 - 5827.56] P:1365.42 E:0.096181 |  the bottom corner well I just can't believe that isn't in the back of the net what a chance
[5828.44 - 5835.32] P:1279.94 E:0.101691 |  super delivery for once England find the space Kane is unmarked he's a little bit in advance but
[5835.88 - 5841.64] P:1351.20 E:0.104047 |  technically I think the ball kind of just drops on he's not really positioned to guide that inside
[5841.72 - 5847.08] P:1456.22 E:0.100312 |  the post and he gets good contact heads it down and it's about a yard wider than near post he just
[5847.08 - 5853.00] P:1458.75 E:0.093604 |  can't get the right contact that's good and pitch side to Izzy yeah Pickford's reaction to that chance
[5853.00 - 5858.20] P:1393.90 E:0.098343 |  was interesting he's dropped to his knees he's put his hands on the on the floor almost in like a
[5858.20 - 5862.60] P:1462.05 E:0.100066 |  yoga position he knows how close that was and the fans I can feel it behind me increasingly
[5862.60 - 5870.68] P:1394.65 E:0.086398 |  frustrated their facial expressions their nervy thanks Izzy he has Fordham still inside his own
[5870.68 - 5877.64] P:1523.61 E:0.091553 |  half it's just right in the balance here England playing with with fire at the back he's able to
[5877.64 - 5883.16] P:1506.13 E:0.108542 |  get the ball down and take it away from Bozheny and now Maynard lovely from him on the halfway
[5883.16 - 5887.48] P:1656.87 E:0.106478 |  line white shirt pouring forward folding ahead of him Bellingham's on the left hand side here
[5888.04 - 5892.52] P:1477.79 E:0.114418 |  he gives it to Bellingham left footed crossing but that is far too close to the Brafko who can
[5892.52 - 5899.16] P:1552.58 E:0.093684 |  make the catch he's going to see another double change for Slovakia very shortly I'm just looking
[5899.16 - 5906.04] P:1380.65 E:0.094751 |  to see if yep we've got a barrage Eza who is going to be brought on by Garoslavl
[5906.04 - 5910.36] P:1401.70 E:0.100469 |  yes it's going to be really interesting to see who does come off I mean fresh legs for Slovakia as well
[5910.36 - 5915.00] P:1475.19 E:0.095433 |  they're hanging on they're going to freshen up and air the pitch now and all it is is out of
[5915.00 - 5919.48] P:1484.65 E:0.095329 |  possession how much pressure how hard can you be to play against but they've really ran themselves
[5919.48 - 5923.72] P:1523.65 E:0.093431 |  into the ground what a performance as a team regardless of where this game goes John they
[5923.72 - 5930.04] P:1662.02 E:0.094563 |  have just been superb and I think they can see the finishing line now as well the big clock
[5930.04 - 5938.20] P:1572.59 E:0.091652 |  is on the screen right above the centre circle just under the roof 79 minutes and 13 seconds and
[5938.20 - 5944.84] P:1564.24 E:0.100946 |  Rice crossfield pass to Saka Saka takes that down he's up against Peckery and then plays it in field
[5944.84 - 5950.92] P:1568.70 E:0.101868 |  Thoden holds off the challenge again this tireless Slovak side Rice curls it into the box clear away
[5950.92 - 5955.64] P:1637.63 E:0.101774 |  though by hands go sort of flick healed it back healed it away with England players there
[5955.64 - 5960.04] P:1434.94 E:0.093342 |  I can't tell you how good that was John from the left back who has just been superb as well to
[5960.04 - 5964.76] P:1569.73 E:0.100479 |  defend like that and actually get the outside of his left boot and like you say flick the ball away
[5964.76 - 5970.52] P:1551.43 E:0.096536 |  into space where his team is what a piece he defended a 26 year old firenord man as England
[5970.52 - 5977.24] P:1378.58 E:0.119149 |  come again down the right hand side 10 minutes to go one nil Slovakia lead called Parmado for
[5977.24 - 5983.48] P:1492.86 E:0.107468 |  England the substitute now Kyle Walker rolls his foot back to Palmer law ball into Thoden just
[5983.48 - 5988.84] P:1717.63 E:0.106712 |  outside the edge of the penalty area Saka Saka in the fallback position ball across hits the
[5988.84 - 5993.80] P:1508.93 E:0.106344 |  defender Peckery bounces back to the Kyle Saka then back to Rice onto his right foot Rice for
[5993.80 - 6001.00] P:1543.73 E:0.107635 |  the shot hits the post came bounces the shot into the ground up and over and behind the width of
[6001.08 - 6008.76] P:1510.22 E:0.104906 |  a post still one nil Slovakia wow what a moment bang off the upright ricochet back onto the penalty
[6008.76 - 6014.04] P:1512.62 E:0.097797 |  spot and it is a tough chance for Harry Kane it's a great hit from Rice with his right foot steps
[6014.04 - 6021.72] P:1471.39 E:0.093934 |  inside the pitch hits it draws it to the near post back out Kane into the ground he nearly
[6021.72 - 6028.68] P:1375.49 E:0.106656 |  does everything right it is tough to finish Gareth Southgate hands on his head Rice hands on his face
[6029.56 - 6035.96] P:1534.64 E:0.098559 |  and England 10 minutes to go I think there's enough time Joe there's no need to panic but
[6036.60 - 6041.16] P:1530.24 E:0.100025 |  there's going to be more opportunities in this game so many bodies deep in front of Martin DeBrakke
[6041.16 - 6045.88] P:1603.35 E:0.103151 |  they're so hard to get that dive off they're just dropping and dropping they're not even considering
[6045.88 - 6051.48] P:1595.89 E:0.102624 |  playing out Slovakia are shattered and I grew do my matter we don't need to panic here we need to
[6051.48 - 6055.64] P:1658.37 E:0.106352 |  all England need to look for the goal and I think if we can take it to extra time unfortunately not
[6055.64 - 6059.08] P:1734.30 E:0.100457 |  ideal not ideal situation but we're not here for ideal situations we're here to try and win the
[6059.08 - 6066.12] P:1586.41 E:0.086568 |  tournament if we can get them into extra time I think this game's over however Slovakia are winning
[6066.12 - 6073.88] P:1644.38 E:0.104042 |  it a double change for Slovakia Duda and Kutskara both being taken off from the midfield and they
[6073.88 - 6083.08] P:1678.45 E:0.105220 |  have been replaced by Benes and Barrow and in England Concealer throwing on the far side and
[6084.04 - 6087.88] P:1681.53 E:0.096561 |  England when the substitution comes it is
[6092.20 - 6100.84] P:1717.75 E:0.101853 |  well it will be a barrage Eze who is coming on for England and Rice playing the ball back
[6100.84 - 6107.56] P:1618.80 E:0.092437 |  towards the the figure of Jordan Pickford who apart from that scary moment when Strelitz went
[6107.56 - 6112.76] P:1512.44 E:0.101778 |  for goal from the centre circle there's been a virtual spectator in the second half but England
[6113.64 - 6120.12] P:1568.91 E:0.105557 |  now well there are seven minutes plus added time left if it's going to come it's going to be late
[6120.68 - 6124.92] P:1493.77 E:0.113126 |  England couldn't score against Slovenia and now they're being held by Slovakia
[6127.64 - 6134.84] P:1585.57 E:0.099799 |  throwing taken quickly Mainu no couldn't get there and and it is Barrow who gets his first touch
[6134.84 - 6140.84] P:1639.55 E:0.104116 |  and Barrow again to the left hand side Barrow makes a run through the middle and Rice has to get
[6140.84 - 6146.68] P:1739.02 E:0.105770 |  that but he does and he takes the ball on away from Barrow and runs it into his own penalty area
[6146.68 - 6151.56] P:1659.29 E:0.104850 |  I thought for a moment that Barrow was going to nip into score very close really did nearly get the
[6151.56 - 6156.36] P:1552.55 E:0.102931 |  wrong side that they do play some lovely football when they take their time on the ball I think it's
[6156.36 - 6159.72] P:1655.76 E:0.109584 |  the Botker at the heart of it again but they've got nice angles they've got running off the ball
[6159.80 - 6164.52] P:1633.94 E:0.103246 |  the energy they're finding Slovakia to get forward at this stage in the game is impressive
[6164.52 - 6169.32] P:1629.30 E:0.100775 |  John Stones wins a throw in a winter handball free kick on the halfway line and then threatens to
[6169.32 - 6174.84] P:1641.18 E:0.104616 |  take it and push an e-cast to move out of the way right here's the change it's Mainu who's coming on
[6174.84 - 6181.88] P:1765.65 E:0.104056 |  off from the midfield and a barrage as he's coming on on the left hand side well interesting switch
[6181.88 - 6187.40] P:1558.18 E:0.108541 |  I mean Mainu has been absolutely brilliant I think I think he's done a good job stepping into a game
[6187.40 - 6191.72] P:1542.61 E:0.102846 |  like this with England playing how they are and coping with it and actually in the first half as
[6191.72 - 6197.40] P:1597.64 E:0.090136 |  we discussed at half time was was very very good I think he can come off the pitch feeling very proud
[6197.40 - 6205.96] P:1600.27 E:0.095132 |  of his performance one nil Slovakia lead England will be going home tomorrow with this score line
[6207.96 - 6215.40] P:1654.74 E:0.100177 |  Saka to Ezra Ezra now skips in field uses Kyle walk actually the pass was slightly
[6215.40 - 6221.56] P:1538.05 E:0.103122 |  wider than Palmer does as well actually but then Slovakia able to nip in win it back Bellingham's
[6221.56 - 6227.00] P:1593.37 E:0.109445 |  into the challenge Ezra turns brilliant turn as that misses his kick as he went for goal he actually

[6231.80 - 6236.84] P:1664.00 E:0.110564 |  the stadium here urging England on Bellingham tries to go around the outside of Suzlop he's
[6236.84 - 6241.80] P:1457.32 E:0.112085 |  fouled it's a free kick he then actually took the ball away but the referee had already blown his
[6242.44 - 6246.92] P:1549.64 E:0.110608 |  free kick on the right five minutes to go just all that I mean I can't believe
[6246.92 - 6252.12] P:1595.03 E:0.111401 |  with five minutes left of the game and we still won nil down but Suzlop just couldn't deal with
[6252.12 - 6257.08] P:1583.06 E:0.103378 |  Bellingham there Riggles passed in wins the foul legitimately but we've had several free kicks
[6257.08 - 6261.88] P:1670.27 E:0.100687 |  from this situation in the game and the delivery's actually been good in but that's how good
[6261.88 - 6265.96] P:1677.86 E:0.098731 |  Slovakia have been at defending them the two set the backs I mean Scrinniar's been immense
[6266.36 - 6270.68] P:1682.97 E:0.105247 |  free kick then for England set peace opportunity
[6271.48 - 6278.20] P:1728.13 E:0.114327 |  folding to swing it in Slovakia winning 1-0 the signal from folding and it goes too close to
[6278.20 - 6283.48] P:1662.69 E:0.102135 |  goalkeeper to Bravket he's able to punch it away you'd have thought he could have caught it
[6283.48 - 6289.64] P:1728.46 E:0.101557 |  he's not caught that I mean you got a punch I took one look at Joe and he just the raised eyes
[6290.60 - 6296.76] P:1638.03 E:0.105139 |  catch it what a punch England again Rice Rice's ball Kane controls on the edge of the box works
[6296.76 - 6302.60] P:1629.97 E:0.098776 |  it to his left half cleared as a ring with the challenge and Slovakia scrape it away and actually
[6302.60 - 6308.60] P:1605.45 E:0.093039 |  bring it away for them into the last five minutes it's probably take the ball to the corner flag
[6308.60 - 6317.40] P:1541.15 E:0.092793 |  time but England win it back ball was played forward by Benesh England to Foden Foden now
[6317.40 - 6322.04] P:1642.91 E:0.105266 |  moves infield into a nest of blue shirts the ball is deflected actually out to Palmer on the
[6322.04 - 6325.72] P:1556.04 E:0.102920 |  right hand side that was a fortunate break of it and then in comes the challenge from
[6325.72 - 6330.52] P:1606.84 E:0.101763 |  hands go out of play throwing really defending again hands go the energy the footwork to get
[6330.52 - 6335.96] P:1502.37 E:0.092304 |  out to Palmer there quickly put the brakes on the justice feet superb Palmer receives a Palmer's
[6335.96 - 6342.04] P:1528.62 E:0.098595 |  ball into the area this one's headed away to comparative safety by Scrinniar comes out for
[6342.12 - 6347.64] P:1537.03 E:0.105368 |  gay now back to Palmer again Palmer couldn't find the pass that Harry Kane cut out on the edge of
[6347.64 - 6354.52] P:1482.44 E:0.093650 |  the box and played away for Slovakia who will look to Poznanique he's still inside his own half but
[6354.52 - 6359.08] P:1637.22 E:0.109520 |  then eventually all they do is give possession back to England these could be the final minutes for
[6359.08 - 6365.08] P:1546.66 E:0.100702 |  Gareth Southgate as the England manager in his 99th match unless his team are able to find the goal
[6365.08 - 6370.92] P:1617.60 E:0.099662 |  here Rice Rice to Foden but it bounces for Slovakia and Poznanique in the centre circle
[6370.92 - 6376.76] P:1511.89 E:0.096442 |  but now blue shirts do come forward and it's it is Schrantz the man who scored the goal
[6377.72 - 6383.40] P:1630.17 E:0.095809 |  such a long time ago in the match Schrantz plays it back to Poznanique Poznanique infield that will
[6383.40 - 6389.96] P:1737.34 E:0.102687 |  break for Lebotka Lebotka shoots for goal and Pickford straight out and is able to pass it down
[6389.96 - 6395.96] P:1626.56 E:0.110375 |  from what 25 yards yeah we never troubled Pickford but it did open up a little bit and I mean I can't
[6395.96 - 6401.40] P:1644.53 E:0.104322 |  believe Slovenia since the back of sorry are still pressing high up the pitch I mean it is pretty
[6402.04 - 6409.00] P:1415.25 E:0.108685 |  unbelievable but I just I never pictured this scenario John leaving the hotel earlier on the
[6409.00 - 6414.20] P:1655.60 E:0.105713 |  way to the game picturing how the game's going to go I didn't expect a great England performance but
[6414.84 - 6418.52] P:1609.32 E:0.112454 |  I certainly didn't expect them to be in this situation with 87 minutes on the clock
[6419.08 - 6426.20] P:1509.51 E:0.106628 |  chasing the game 1-0 down heading out of the Euros in the last 16 England with stones he has
[6426.20 - 6432.20] P:1547.26 E:0.110032 |  Palmer then Foden with a run into the box could open up here but Lebotka was in place to stab it
[6432.20 - 6438.60] P:1493.59 E:0.112230 |  away behind for a corner from the right well just bodies in the box England Bellingham and Kane both
[6438.60 - 6443.56] P:1527.43 E:0.122074 |  in a similar position in the box nobody really gets across that near post area and sure enough there's
[6443.56 - 6448.92] P:1797.12 E:0.116475 |  a blue shirt in there ready to deal with it and put the ball out of the box again big moments these
[6448.92 - 6455.72] P:1833.23 E:0.107256 |  big moments at the Euros for England have to find a goal Foden with the corner in under the
[6455.72 - 6459.96] P:1665.18 E:0.101459 |  crossbar Bellingham with a challenge to Brabka goes down referee's not interested headed back
[6459.96 - 6465.32] P:1614.76 E:0.109175 |  in by Ezzer still not out of the penalty area and then Ezzer commits a foul on the edge of the box
[6465.32 - 6470.76] P:1593.81 E:0.102471 |  and a free kick to the lucky yet another great header in there to really control Paul to his
[6471.72 - 6476.92] P:1578.82 E:0.106661 |  huge header super header wouldn't I mean they took to a man in anything in the box it's just
[6476.92 - 6482.60] P:1641.03 E:0.102849 |  been brilliant and the way Lebotka just wins the foul there's a tiny hand on the back from Ezzer
[6483.24 - 6488.12] P:1474.51 E:0.104254 |  but he drops to the floor and takes this thing out of the game there's a free kick in their own
[6488.12 - 6492.52] P:1400.58 E:0.096180 |  box they're taking their time they're running the clock down it'd be interesting to see what kind of
[6492.52 - 6498.52] P:1389.82 E:0.105808 |  added time England have to play with but this is this is scary stuff John
[6499.32 - 6505.32] P:1571.79 E:0.106716 |  it is 90 seconds of the 90 minutes to go commentary on Spain Georgia to come
[6506.04 - 6512.92] P:1481.53 E:0.103783 |  right now England would take anything they'd take expert time they'd take penalties whatever it takes
[6514.20 - 6520.28] P:1460.62 E:0.101273 |  but they are on the way home from Germany unless unless Kane on the halfway line
[6521.16 - 6527.88] P:1629.54 E:0.102559 |  Rice hit the post with a shot Kane couldn't shoot in the follow-up goes back to do Brabka
[6527.88 - 6535.56] P:1627.71 E:0.100324 |  to Brabka's clearance Garasagic catches it and hands it to Saka and then back to not gay gay turns
[6536.28 - 6543.64] P:1567.71 E:0.096906 |  and uses Saka then gay can't take my eyes off that clock there'll be five minutes just five
[6543.64 - 6550.68] P:1769.56 E:0.101986 |  minutes of added time they don't know that in the stadium yet Palmer still only 10 yards inside the
[6550.68 - 6556.12] P:1844.48 E:0.105207 |  Slovakia half Palmer takes it on himself and then Palmer's pass is blocked and Slovakia just
[6556.12 - 6562.12] P:1702.62 E:0.098204 |  anywhere will do volleyed away into the centre circle John Stones then heads it back to Pickford
[6562.84 - 6567.08] P:1586.06 E:0.104441 |  well it's been quite a story for Garas Southgate and his England team but I think it's going to come
[6567.08 - 6572.36] P:1501.27 E:0.104901 |  to a bit around unless they can come up with a goal it just doesn't look likely John at the moment
[6572.36 - 6577.16] P:1552.28 E:0.106629 |  I mean if anything Slovakia having the probably the better joy and an hour of bouncing with the ball
[6577.16 - 6584.04] P:1601.54 E:0.101043 |  and here they come with Schrantz on the right wing Schrantz he's the hero again as he turns and passes
[6584.04 - 6589.88] P:1683.98 E:0.113613 |  it out as tired six minutes it's actually six minutes that have been added on and now Kane
[6589.88 - 6594.04] P:1225.90 E:0.120559 |  turns on the halfway line and passes the ball actually behind Palmer that there's no one there
[6594.04 - 6600.28] P:1659.06 E:0.112565 |  in a blue shirt so England Palmer is able to carry it forward the England supporters thousands of them
[6600.28 - 6608.52] P:1623.22 E:0.096864 |  urging their team on Rice then back to gay gay again Declan Rice pulls away to the left hand side
[6608.52 - 6614.44] P:1438.91 E:0.103074 |  Ezra ahead of him Saka Saka forward towards a barrage at Eze who finished the season so well
[6614.44 - 6619.08] P:1546.96 E:0.113235 |  with Crystal Palace he turns his man Vabro then the cross into the penalty area bought by Packereak
[6619.08 - 6625.64] P:1538.88 E:0.101948 |  for a corner whenever a blue shirt has been beaten there's been another one that comes across and
[6625.64 - 6630.28] P:1466.87 E:0.105117 |  gets the job done defensively they've been brilliant as teammates for each other tonight Slovakia
[6630.92 - 6635.56] P:1476.95 E:0.105728 |  I mean Vabro comes out of the box there gets done by Eze and there's a recovering midfield player
[6635.56 - 6638.76] P:1368.04 E:0.103062 |  running all the way across to get that block in and put it out for a corner
[6638.76 - 6643.96] P:1394.24 E:0.109878 |  five minutes of added time to go Ezra right footed corner to the back post to Brabler comes
[6643.96 - 6649.64] P:1423.71 E:0.098917 |  gets a punch on it Thornton will allow it to bounce he's being forced out there by
[6651.08 - 6658.28] P:1666.57 E:0.104060 |  Schrantz you've got to touch on that onto Thornton minutes of throwing to Slovakia
[6658.28 - 6663.24] P:1578.50 E:0.095475 |  in their own left back position and it was the perfect amount of pressure from Schrantz not
[6663.24 - 6667.16] P:1522.48 E:0.103379 |  committing a foul but making Foden really uncomfortable and I'm looking at Garis Algate
[6667.16 - 6673.96] P:1437.74 E:0.100057 |  on the monitor hands in his pockets looking at the floor I think he feels what's coming John is
[6673.96 - 6681.08] P:1440.13 E:0.101891 |  yeah it's not looking good he knows what's coming we'll hear from him post match whatever happens
[6682.04 - 6687.24] P:1375.75 E:0.104152 |  throwing is taken see Slovakia are going to bring on John Bear as well no but John Bear so
[6687.24 - 6691.96] P:1411.75 E:0.098887 |  that'll waste a few more seconds that's their final change and we've got
[6694.04 - 6698.44] P:1502.83 E:0.114711 |  we are in to the point where we've got four minutes of added time to play
[6698.44 - 6702.36] P:1505.96 E:0.108078 |  Rice challenges for a ball inside the pang of the area but he's got his head to it and it bounces
[6702.36 - 6707.56] P:1456.74 E:0.103286 |  through Rice's stones it is down on his back I think he's got a bang in the face as well
[6707.56 - 6711.88] P:1454.42 E:0.102008 |  as he put the challenge in on that possibly the way that he fell actually caught his face on the
[6711.96 - 6717.16] P:1475.34 E:0.107771 |  ground yeah he lands quite awkwardly I mean his desperation isn't it John Stone's up there
[6717.16 - 6721.08] P:1534.28 E:0.107986 |  trying to get anything on the ball just to keep it in play and head it back in the box and
[6721.64 - 6727.48] P:1433.51 E:0.107668 |  that full stretch lands very awkwardly smashes his face off the turf he's back up on his feet but
[6728.84 - 6736.68] P:1528.35 E:0.103389 |  I mean I just can't believe we're in this situation yeah well I can relate to this it's not a nice
[6736.68 - 6742.68] P:1744.13 E:0.112839 |  feeling I was there in 2016 the game we're talking about and as a goalkeeper and as a player you're
[6742.68 - 6748.12] P:1706.94 E:0.101560 |  just hoping for one more chance one more big moment you never give up you've got to keep pushing you've
[6748.12 - 6754.28] P:1711.00 E:0.104088 |  got to keep believing the change final Slovak change is made and it's the goal scorer Ivan
[6754.28 - 6758.20] P:1725.61 E:0.101652 |  Shrance his goal is being shown on the big screens England are going to make a very late
[6758.20 - 6762.76] P:1597.80 E:0.098360 |  change as well Ivan Tony coming on for his first experience of the tournament and
[6763.72 - 6770.12] P:1572.90 E:0.092362 |  and he they'll have to wait though can't it can't happen yet so Norbert John Bear of
[6770.12 - 6779.08] P:1529.31 E:0.092213 |  Salerno Tana comes on into the midfield for Slovakia and we have now less than three minutes to play
[6779.88 - 6788.44] P:1609.32 E:0.103806 |  forward from game headed away by Vavro Forden now turns England simply not being able to find
[6788.52 - 6796.60] P:1528.75 E:0.100955 |  the way through and past this awkward spirited Slovakia team who are on course for Switzerland
[6796.60 - 6803.40] P:1460.36 E:0.100945 |  and the quarterfinals on Saturday stones Tama balanced himself well Walker though can't reach
[6803.40 - 6809.80] P:1668.10 E:0.094296 |  that it's just chipped out of play by Skrinyafra throwing to England down the left with just
[6809.80 - 6817.08] P:1671.43 E:0.101375 |  over two minutes now to go and now the change is made the final change the final throw of the dice
[6818.44 - 6825.16] P:1681.97 E:0.107737 |  from Gareth Southgate Ivan Tony replacing Phil Forden who is ready to take the throw the boost
[6825.16 - 6832.20] P:1762.12 E:0.095815 |  from the England fans I think Tony pick Tony takes up a position inside the penalty area
[6832.20 - 6838.36] P:1690.21 E:0.094779 |  it's going to be a long throw for England we're into the penultimate minute here comes the throw
[6838.36 - 6844.20] P:1621.92 E:0.097630 |  headed away for Slovakia turned back in by Rice stones was after it cleared away out of play
[6844.20 - 6849.32] P:1535.46 E:0.103426 |  throwing next to the corner flag Kyle Walker waiting to take it urges the ball back from someone
[6849.32 - 6855.64] P:1709.85 E:0.101070 |  over the hoardings there Walker again winds himself up here's the throw flat to the near post flaked
[6855.64 - 6868.76] P:1653.71 E:0.116439 |  on over it's one one it's that man too Balian he's come up with the magic he saved England
[6868.76 - 6877.32] P:1329.01 E:0.125439 |  he saved Gareth Southgate England wants Slovakia won in the final minute of added time
[6878.52 - 6885.80] P:1349.46 E:0.120394 |  an extra time now is on the cards what a way to do it the day after his 21st birthday
[6887.00 - 6897.72] P:1271.82 E:0.123528 |  who writes his scripts that's a fairy tale one one I I can't believe it what a moment that is
[6898.76 - 6906.60] P:1352.10 E:0.118558 |  the long throw into the box to flick on from Gehir the overhead acrobatic kick from that man
[6906.60 - 6914.36] P:1337.42 E:0.124903 |  Jude Bellingham to look dead on his feet he finds this from somewhere it's so accurate it's
[6914.36 - 6921.32] P:1487.16 E:0.110424 |  technically executed to perfection England off the hook I mean I just cannot believe we've got
[6921.32 - 6928.12] P:1586.24 E:0.107739 |  away with that performance in this stage of the game it's just incredible I cannot believe it John

[6936.36 - 6942.12] P:1598.69 E:0.107453 |  our heads putting balls into the box Slovakia gobbled them up all night great ahead of from
[6942.12 - 6947.64] P:1620.80 E:0.102991 |  gay heat that was incredible that was absolutely incredible what a time to do it you can see the
[6947.64 - 6951.80] P:1525.21 E:0.111578 |  anger you can see the frustration he's hearing people talking about him and for the first time
[6951.80 - 6956.92] P:1572.81 E:0.109650 |  in his career they've not been saying good things but oh my goodness me what a moment from Jude
[6957.72 - 6965.72] P:1554.78 E:0.101243 |  well England have provided a moment for their supporters at this euros right right at the
[6965.72 - 6971.56] P:1548.54 E:0.107218 |  point when it seemed they were heading out and Jude Bellingham making it England one Slovakia one
[6971.56 - 6977.32] P:1493.85 E:0.107858 |  with an overhead kick from what was he mad 10 yards out it flew into the net and the scenes of
[6977.32 - 6982.36] P:1500.11 E:0.112023 |  celebration from England this is really taking me back to Moscow but the other way around against
[6982.36 - 6988.76] P:1498.96 E:0.105165 |  Columbia remember the Colombians came up with the Yerimina with his equalizer to take it to extra
[6988.76 - 6993.08] P:1497.80 E:0.102399 |  time we're still playing we're way beyond the six minutes now after the England celebrations
[6993.08 - 6998.04] P:1515.05 E:0.106481 |  Harry Kane with the ball inside the each Slovakia Harvest challenged thought he might have been
[6998.04 - 7003.64] P:1534.32 E:0.104243 |  felled but referee Mel air allows that play to continue and there it is there's the final whistle
[7003.64 - 7009.24] P:1645.33 E:0.112704 |  and we've got extra time here in galsen kerkin and look at the lift Matt that this is given to

[7025.64 - 7031.64] P:1516.44 E:0.103007 |  and your body language now if you're a Slovakia player you have got to drag yourself up from the
[7031.64 - 7037.88] P:1498.09 E:0.105081 |  floor this game was one they had done an amazing job what a performance from then and you have now
[7037.88 - 7043.48] P:1517.42 E:0.098405 |  got to pick yourself up for half an hour of extra time it surely swung right back into England's
[7043.48 - 7048.92] P:1493.83 E:0.105124 |  favor I really do I think that I think from maybe the 41st minute onwards England started having
[7048.92 - 7054.20] P:1457.14 E:0.107490 |  we're in the ascendancy and Slovakia but they were feeling we were discussing it you know 75%
[7054.20 - 7058.92] P:1530.89 E:0.106116 |  possession it's just possession but it does it takes out of your legs it takes the confidence
[7058.92 - 7063.80] P:1488.35 E:0.110075 |  it takes the belief and every time they were able to bring two subs substitutes on they had that
[7063.80 - 7068.20] P:1615.31 E:0.110698 |  little bit of energy they got two three passes together but that's been it in isolation Jordan
[7068.20 - 7072.28] P:1558.24 E:0.107165 |  Pickford's just been basically orchestrating from the back England have been threatening but is
[7072.28 - 7076.20] P:1582.41 E:0.108287 |  that their first shot on target I think that's the crazy thing I don't think there's not been a huge
[7076.20 - 7080.20] P:1557.92 E:0.112074 |  amount of pressure on Martin de Brabkir in terms of shots and shots raining in but the pressure
[7080.20 - 7085.80] P:1618.46 E:0.102268 |  was just coming and coming and yes it was first shot on target bicycle kick in the 96th minute
[7085.80 - 7091.40] P:1517.53 E:0.110223 |  what a moment well England's supporters England's followers wanted some excitement at this euros
[7091.40 - 7098.92] P:1427.41 E:0.104771 |  it came rather late England once Slovakia won an extra time to follow well they haven't been happy
[7098.92 - 7104.76] P:1560.50 E:0.110059 |  behind you have the easy christiansome but they are now do you know what I cannot stop laughing
[7104.76 - 7112.28] P:1510.56 E:0.107240 |  because I have just seen firsthand what the word limbs means oh my word the fans behind me have
[7112.28 - 7115.96] P:1515.06 E:0.106110 |  gone absolutely nuts they've taken their tops off they're swinging them around their heads
[7116.60 - 7121.64] P:1614.77 E:0.105571 |  every single one well most of them have got their tops off they the atmosphere is just
[7121.64 - 7127.72] P:1461.08 E:0.103036 |  incredible the noise is deafening and my word has it swung back into England's favour
[7128.52 - 7134.20] P:1487.91 E:0.096342 |  I mean I think and we were talking about it Joe during the commentary I think that might be the
[7134.20 - 7141.08] P:1567.29 E:0.089320 |  only header that Slovakia didn't win in their box for the whole of the 96 minutes
[7141.08 - 7145.72] P:1626.92 E:0.099584 |  yeah it seemed it didn't seem like the right play but desperation there was absolute desperation
[7145.80 - 7150.36] P:1641.42 E:0.101004 |  John Stones was playing up front at one point there was pure desperation and then there was
[7150.36 - 7155.32] P:1636.49 E:0.100733 |  that guy Jude Bellingham Harry Kane's not that kind of guy but he was next to him doing the
[7155.32 - 7160.12] P:1673.39 E:0.097815 |  Jude Bellingham celebration in this stadium that's what's happened that's the feeling in the place
[7160.76 - 7165.48] P:1710.72 E:0.104262 |  huge lift huge pressure on Slovakia now and England have got to press home this advantage
[7166.52 - 7171.00] P:1724.95 E:0.107108 |  they will now won't they going into extra time is he and just looking at
[7171.72 - 7177.16] P:1754.83 E:0.103792 |  sort of the contrast really of the two groups of players there are a few Slovakians on the floor
[7177.16 - 7183.72] P:1728.56 E:0.096249 |  getting robbed England with the exception of John Stones and maybe Jude Bellingham are all standing
[7183.72 - 7190.04] P:1667.52 E:0.091020 |  up yeah it's the contrast of elite sport isn't it it can swing in the matter of a split second
[7190.84 - 7196.68] P:1693.76 E:0.098921 |  and the Slovakian team the way that they have defended in this game the structure has been
[7196.68 - 7202.36] P:1636.29 E:0.094915 |  exceptional and I can't help but think they are going to be absolutely knackered now what have
[7202.36 - 7206.92] P:1527.97 E:0.104903 |  they got in their tank and in that England huddle they've got to be wary of the Slovakian threat
[7206.92 - 7213.72] P:1575.87 E:0.104172 |  because on the ball they've shown real glimpses of quality they can break through England but come on
[7213.72 - 7218.60] P:1581.56 E:0.113976 |  it's all about England now they've got to take this and they've got to swing it back well Matt is
[7218.60 - 7222.92] P:1681.22 E:0.103745 |  is he talks about the Slovakian structure the England structure will be interesting
[7223.88 - 7229.24] P:1542.17 E:0.110057 |  in this in this 30 minutes when they're burning mine just before that throwing Foden came off and
[7229.24 - 7233.80] P:1703.29 E:0.100813 |  Tony came on so how they balance this will be interesting well Ivan Tony thought he was going
[7233.80 - 7240.76] P:1728.03 E:0.099759 |  to get one minute of Euro's action is now going to get a hugely important 30 minutes of extra time
[7240.76 - 7244.84] P:1652.90 E:0.088941 |  and you're right that the balance of the team I mean I you lose count of where people are playing
[7244.84 - 7248.28] P:1675.96 E:0.103686 |  and what they're doing at that at that stage in the game is desperation you just throwing people
[7248.28 - 7253.64] P:1629.96 E:0.099558 |  on to see if they can have an impact now England have to settle they have to get a bit of a rhythm
[7253.64 - 7260.04] P:1755.54 E:0.091613 |  and an understanding of who's doing what and what role each player is playing but the main thing is
[7260.04 - 7263.64] P:1630.36 E:0.102952 |  we're hanging in there and we've got an opportunity and that's the only thing that matters right now
[7264.44 - 7270.92] P:1734.38 E:0.103725 |  so be a very very interesting first 15 minutes of extra time just to see the body language
[7271.00 - 7275.80] P:1692.69 E:0.098351 |  and the energy of the two respective teams John Murray
[7277.64 - 7281.32] P:1725.47 E:0.108053 |  well garrison gate and steve holland in discussions on the side of the page
[7282.60 - 7289.88] P:1807.14 E:0.101257 |  so far they've made three substitutions so main who called and and trippie have been taken off
[7290.76 - 7295.32] P:1712.45 E:0.100956 |  so I presume they're talking about exactly what we've been discussing in the balance of the team
[7295.32 - 7300.44] P:1689.19 E:0.096273 |  yeah well yeah just how they're lining up I mean Ivan Tony's out here on the right halfway line
[7300.44 - 7308.20] P:1802.83 E:0.086905 |  sacks is behind him yeah so whether or not it's going to be Eze possibly I mean it's hard to see
[7308.20 - 7312.92] P:1741.08 E:0.108275 |  until the ball they're not really set yet once they get into shape and position we'll have a look
[7312.92 - 7319.56] P:1705.32 E:0.089880 |  but garrison's walker right back whether or not it's going to be a three oh the flick by Tony
[7319.56 - 7324.28] P:1813.72 E:0.098320 |  into the penalty area England kicking off at the start of this period of extra time the first extra
[7324.28 - 7332.60] P:1791.52 E:0.103678 |  time of euro 2024 in England involved in it against world number 45 ranked Slovakia who took
[7332.60 - 7339.32] P:1662.67 E:0.101946 |  England all the way before jude bellingham came up with that equalizer in the fifth minute of added
[7339.32 - 7344.36] P:1793.22 E:0.103509 |  time and Tony has won a free kick for England on the right England now attacking towards their
[7344.36 - 7349.56] P:1863.77 E:0.109606 |  jubilant supporters they almost couldn't believe their eyes I think probably most of them had given
[7349.56 - 7354.76] P:1718.64 E:0.098653 |  it up thought it wasn't going to come thought England were going home with bellingham saved them
[7354.76 - 7359.40] P:1769.82 E:0.091517 |  now Palmer takes the free kick into Brabka comes free gets a punch as it with a shot miss hit across
[7359.40 - 7367.24] P:1812.68 E:0.110624 |  the goal from it and Kane is there! England scored right at the start of extra time from one
[7367.24 - 7374.12] P:1558.93 E:0.113105 |  mil down and almost out now and right at the start of extra time Harry Kane with a close range header
[7374.84 - 7384.52] P:1469.03 E:0.120092 |  and a cheaply two Slovakia won who won it how things can change at the drop of a hat in this game
[7384.52 - 7390.52] P:1604.18 E:0.116268 |  it's crazy absolutely crazy but you just felt England were going to come into this extra time
[7390.52 - 7397.00] P:1606.42 E:0.112270 |  with the positive edge with that ascendancy and they've capitalised on it straight away in extra
[7397.00 - 7403.00] P:1536.12 E:0.116085 |  time it's two players I mean Ivan Tony does brilliantly it's a skewed hit from SA with his right
[7403.00 - 7408.68] P:1528.24 E:0.108566 |  foot he shanks the effort on the edge of the box but the header from Tony it bounces off the floor
[7408.68 - 7415.32] P:1513.29 E:0.109347 |  and he just flicks it right back into the danger area Slovakia have players really deep and it's
[7415.32 - 7420.68] P:1534.20 E:0.101920 |  pretty simple for Harry Kane just to get off the ground and punch the header into an open net the
[7420.68 - 7426.92] P:1602.66 E:0.102738 |  Brabka is all the way across the other side of the goal but Ivan Tony does superbly well with
[7426.92 - 7431.48] P:1715.32 E:0.106056 |  his header just to guide it back into the danger area and have him right in front of his Christianson
[7431.48 - 7438.84] P:1686.60 E:0.105215 |  in front of that goal oh well well well how about turning it around Harry Kane that man he's had
[7438.84 - 7443.80] P:1537.93 E:0.106108 |  so much criticism but what a finish he couldn't really miss could he in the celebration say everything
[7443.80 - 7447.64] P:1471.64 E:0.109235 |  and that man Ivan Tony as well having a say in it you couldn't write it could you
[7448.92 - 7455.88] P:1588.51 E:0.101346 |  Harry Kane that makes it a record extending eight goals for him in knockout matches
[7456.52 - 7464.04] P:1547.47 E:0.109554 |  that either the World Cup or the European Championship 14 goals in total at World Cups and
[7464.04 - 7471.08] P:1483.15 E:0.103728 |  European Championship finals tournaments and Harry Kane was there where it mattered and it looks very
[7471.08 - 7478.60] P:1367.03 E:0.108572 |  very different for England now who are two one up on a on a very tired Slovakia however they attack
[7478.60 - 7484.20] P:1354.42 E:0.109718 |  down the right hand side great noise now swirling around this stadium what a moment that was for
[7484.20 - 7490.84] P:1384.35 E:0.104905 |  England Dalligan scoring in the fifth minute of added time Harry Kane in the first minute of extra time
[7492.36 - 7499.96] P:1363.73 E:0.106312 |  would you say the mood's changed a little bit slightly marginally slightly almost
[7499.96 - 7506.12] P:1347.24 E:0.104497 |  interceptively here so what do England do now guys they've got the lead the dominate in the game
[7506.12 - 7512.12] P:1370.67 E:0.099013 |  Slovakia tired all played across from the left hand side into the penalty area I would suggest
[7512.12 - 7517.48] P:1603.72 E:0.117468 |  you they've got to keep it tight at the back I think nothing different no I agree that's nothing
[7517.48 - 7523.48] P:1607.17 E:0.103055 |  different if you if you start to picture now hanging on to something all of a sudden you wind up on
[7523.48 - 7527.48] P:1542.95 E:0.108498 |  the edge of your own box yeah you know you've almost got to stay in that mindset that you're
[7527.48 - 7533.24] P:1512.79 E:0.110957 |  still drawing the game and you need to just play in that that fashion you know a lot was made after
[7533.24 - 7540.36] P:1518.72 E:0.104912 |  the knockout stages of the competition by those who could remember it that the England's group record
[7540.44 - 7547.56] P:1590.16 E:0.103848 |  was exactly like atalia 19 and at that tournament things really sparked for England in the round
[7547.56 - 7554.20] P:1602.09 E:0.106615 |  of 16 when David Platt scored a goal right at the end of extra time to take England through against
[7554.20 - 7560.44] P:1499.29 E:0.099253 |  Belgium and then after that what a roller coaster against Cameroon in the quarterfinal is that the
[7560.44 - 7567.48] P:1467.60 E:0.101530 |  over the shoulder volley it was what oh that was gas coins free kick so the similarities to 1990
[7567.48 - 7572.92] P:1563.30 E:0.103986 |  continue England we thought they were out now they're in a position where they'd be heading
[7572.92 - 7578.20] P:1605.98 E:0.105102 |  through there's a high foot there from Harry Kane I think it was which is uh which is called
[7578.20 - 7584.36] P:1428.26 E:0.105972 |  scrinny R and it's a free kick to Slovakia just outside the penalty area Kane looking like put
[7584.36 - 7590.92] P:1522.52 E:0.109065 |  a wooden belt in his mouth Harry Kane who's just scored his 65th goal for England I did you know
[7590.92 - 7596.52] P:1498.10 E:0.108346 |  to suggest that Harry Kane should be left out of this team when when Kane has actually now scored
[7596.52 - 7603.24] P:1527.08 E:0.107919 |  14 goals in his last 17 England appearances that's pretty impressive isn't it I mean there's no
[7603.24 - 7607.56] P:1413.14 E:0.108984 |  doubting what he has brought whether or not for me his look that is fittest and sharpest in this
[7607.56 - 7611.64] P:1459.84 E:0.109174 |  tournament I don't think he is and I think he's been struggling a little bit with injury and what
[7611.64 - 7617.24] P:1483.33 E:0.106645 |  have you I don't think he's he's right at his best but if you want anyone in a situation where you
[7617.24 - 7623.32] P:1382.81 E:0.101403 |  need a goal and they've got to finish something statistically you know he's hard hard to match
[7623.32 - 7627.72] P:1378.29 E:0.096927 |  isn't he and you want him in that position to take the chance when it comes and he's he's done
[7627.72 - 7633.72] P:1589.25 E:0.111301 |  that today so on a sunday evening now England lead Slovakia by two goals to one in extra time
[7633.72 - 7637.88] P:1611.18 E:0.106070 |  we've got commentary coming from Cologne from Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton on Spain Georgia
[7638.60 - 7644.92] P:1550.63 E:0.100356 |  which uh that could be a thriller as well we'll see that this has provided some moments for us
[7644.92 - 7648.92] P:1371.69 E:0.095161 |  I mean we've got we've got Eze left back at the moment haven't we yeah that's right I mean it just
[7648.92 - 7652.76] P:1325.38 E:0.108457 |  it seems to be changing all the time but Rice is still sat in front of the back four yeah looks
[7652.84 - 7659.24] P:1592.78 E:0.110394 |  like Eze left back with Bellingham and Palmer in the middle of the pitch Tony and Kane kind of as
[7659.24 - 7665.48] P:1541.84 E:0.100732 |  a two up front with Kane dropping just behind a little bit and it's now about keeping good high
[7665.48 - 7670.52] P:1461.81 E:0.099620 |  pressure it's kind of a back three isn't it yeah with gay and stones and Walker and Sacher on the
[7670.52 - 7676.04] P:1465.98 E:0.107484 |  right Sacher is the right wing back so we've seen all sorts of things that we didn't expect to see
[7676.04 - 7681.48] P:1359.51 E:0.103953 |  here today as Slovakia are attacked with hands go he's been one of their bright lights Slovakia
[7681.48 - 7686.28] P:1397.96 E:0.110243 |  it looks as though I mean that must have just taken so much out of them for England to score
[7686.28 - 7691.64] P:1378.34 E:0.110453 |  those two goals in the way that they did so credit to them if they're able to recover from base and
[7691.64 - 7696.68] P:1459.22 E:0.108034 |  come again which is what they're trying to do now with the ball just outside the area with Benish
[7696.68 - 7701.64] P:1435.46 E:0.111671 |  now to the left hand side to Susloff Susloff's ball into the penalty area but Rice takes charge
[7701.64 - 7707.96] P:1369.45 E:0.113369 |  and runs it away and uh and Rice then on his left foot is able to clear away up towards Tony
[7708.20 - 7714.12] P:1646.44 E:0.112653 |  England playing with Tony and Kane up front we weren't expecting that we weren't expecting
[7714.12 - 7720.12] P:1456.85 E:0.102031 |  return to three central defenders we weren't expecting Ezi at left wing back no but I certainly
[7720.12 - 7724.20] P:1325.45 E:0.112007 |  expect to see what Tony did there that is what he brings to the team uses his body
[7724.76 - 7730.28] P:1240.03 E:0.105407 |  superbly well just backs in it's got that big frame really backs into the center back doesn't
[7730.28 - 7736.12] P:1226.87 E:0.105406 |  allow him a clean run to go and attack the ball and he buys and wins that foul takes the contact
[7736.12 - 7740.92] P:1240.64 E:0.107741 |  and just allows England to settle a little bit get up the pitch slow the pace of the game down
[7740.92 - 7745.80] P:1357.01 E:0.108535 |  and take control you just want to see some control possession at the moment and just keep the ball
[7745.80 - 7752.20] P:1383.50 E:0.109048 |  a little bit well we're midway through the first period of extra time so there's still quite a
[7752.20 - 7759.24] P:1392.52 E:0.110075 |  long way to go before England can celebrate a place in the quarterfinals and at 2-1 of course
[7759.96 - 7767.64] P:1409.29 E:0.103636 |  it is finally poised Ezi now here is Bellingham he's enhanced his reputation he's built his
[7767.64 - 7778.84] P:1407.91 E:0.100920 |  reputation Ezi runs away from the challenge from Boznik now Walker Walker to Saka Saka looking
[7778.84 - 7783.72] P:1496.86 E:0.103157 |  for the passing field towards Harry Kane Kane turns tries to play one of those Kane passes
[7783.72 - 7788.84] P:1502.35 E:0.105740 |  shoulders hunched left footed out to the far side he's looking for Tony but it was intercepted by
[7788.92 - 7794.36] P:1506.67 E:0.106507 |  Pecorico still on the field incidentally the 37 year old he's still going he's still going
[7797.48 - 7800.44] P:1297.23 E:0.113967 |  here's Sprinniar the Slovakia captain
[7802.44 - 7808.76] P:1375.54 E:0.113285 |  from a point where for England supporters about 10 minutes ago 15 minutes ago it seemed that the
[7808.76 - 7815.56] P:1481.33 E:0.111390 |  clock was whizzing around now for them it seems as though it's slowed almost to stopping point
[7815.56 - 7825.88] P:1341.07 E:0.105300 |  those uh Fabro it's a long pass gaze underneath that for for England now Declan Rice Eza then
[7825.88 - 7830.12] P:1397.97 E:0.105933 |  back towards the edge of the penalty area and all the way back to to goalkeeper Tickford if you've
[7830.12 - 7835.08] P:1555.47 E:0.101862 |  just switched on if you've been out at about on a Sunday and haven't heard what a dramatic afternoon
[7835.08 - 7840.60] P:1420.76 E:0.106167 |  we've had here in Gelsenkirk in England 1-0 down the early goal from Ivan Trance in the first half
[7840.60 - 7846.12] P:1448.95 E:0.109022 |  right deep into added time when Jude Bellingham with an overhead kick made it 1-1 to take it
[7846.12 - 7851.40] P:1469.34 E:0.104408 |  into expert time and then right at the start of expert time after a free kick on the right a shot
[7851.40 - 7857.88] P:1520.37 E:0.096153 |  from Eza Ivan Tony managed to work it across the penalty area and Harry Kane in the middle from
[7857.88 - 7862.92] P:1410.80 E:0.105565 |  first range headed into the back of the Slovak net so 2-1 it is to England Eza
[7863.56 - 7868.68] P:1441.28 E:0.107126 |  heading the ball away so that you're trying to put pressure on England now Fabro
[7868.68 - 7874.36] P:1224.25 E:0.122024 |  Fabro through to LeBotte Cat LeBotte catches outside the box LeBotte Cat turns plays it back
[7875.96 - 7878.84] P:1160.90 E:0.130930 |  you know a lot of time there Joe didn't LeBotte because there was nothing in front of him so
[7878.84 - 7882.44] P:1191.96 E:0.121457 |  he couldn't find the pass but he had a lot of time to turn on the edge of the box
[7882.44 - 7886.76] P:1202.56 E:0.118697 |  screen yard Slovakia fighting their feet again in the game the ball comes in Tickford comes
[7886.76 - 7892.12] P:1640.71 E:0.122671 |  and is able to tap it down up and across from Hansquon the left hand side and drops down onto his
[7892.12 - 7897.72] P:1329.25 E:0.118384 |  knees a bit like he does in those Everton games Joe where Tickford will catch it drop down flat on
[7897.72 - 7903.96] P:1292.37 E:0.110660 |  his face to wind up the Liverpool fans yeah um yeah that's how he likes to play the game
[7903.96 - 7909.00] P:1455.85 E:0.102960 |  that's what he does obviously it's important now to I don't I don't want us to just wind the
[7909.00 - 7913.16] P:1556.05 E:0.106561 |  clock down I think I think another goal completely kills the game but obviously I understand there's
[7913.16 - 7918.84] P:1391.47 E:0.106069 |  a lot go a lot on the line here but another goal completely kills this and Slovakia they've come
[7918.84 - 7922.76] P:1503.22 E:0.112078 |  back into the game ironically when they're 2-1 down of course but us just dropping off just allowing
[7922.76 - 7927.24] P:1611.39 E:0.098846 |  them in when they were absolutely crushed yeah they could make another change an extra time actually
[7927.24 - 7934.28] P:1571.64 E:0.092627 |  Conagalliga is getting ready so uh England going to just alter things with the 2-1 lead
[7935.56 - 7942.84] P:1561.70 E:0.100857 |  as uh as you said Matt with Tony and Kane up front interesting to see who Conagalliga comes on for
[7942.84 - 7949.96] P:1547.01 E:0.100901 |  here stones with the ball on the edge of his penalty area turns it forward as Joe said Joe Hart
[7950.68 - 7956.44] P:1451.47 E:0.103216 |  suggested there that England don't want to go all safety first and cautious again do they
[7957.08 - 7961.80] P:1519.48 E:0.100851 |  oh absolutely not I just think you you've got a picture it's still as being level
[7962.44 - 7966.36] P:1431.98 E:0.106676 |  and you play with it in that kind of manner it's progressive okay you want to have
[7966.36 - 7970.44] P:1600.26 E:0.103103 |  control possession but you want to do it in the right area the pitch not in your own 18 yard
[7970.44 - 7975.88] P:1521.96 E:0.096599 |  box necessarily and just get yourself up the pitch into their territory long pass forward from walk up
[7975.96 - 7981.72] P:1576.87 E:0.097684 |  long long downfield and it's headed back to uh to Gorky by Dubravka by Jumper
[7982.36 - 7987.72] P:1374.74 E:0.110897 |  Dubravka gets it down you know we did speculate didn't we about whether Jude Pellingham was going
[7987.72 - 7993.16] P:1496.62 E:0.107830 |  to be able to continue in the game he did well justified leaving him on doesn't he
[7994.20 - 7998.20] P:1389.42 E:0.114971 |  you can you can doubt that you can't doubt that I mean it must have been easy to look looking at
[7998.20 - 8003.72] P:1350.83 E:0.101126 |  him thinking and need to switch him because he looks really tired but Gareth Southgate making
[8003.72 - 8006.92] P:1372.24 E:0.106629 |  exactly the right call there to leave him on to produce something like that that's
[8007.48 - 8012.92] P:1493.31 E:0.101921 |  just look out on his feet again no doesn't he just watching him now as Slavakir attacked down the
[8012.92 - 8016.68] P:1637.74 E:0.109869 |  right hand side the ball is kept in look as though it's going to go out for throwing Susalop
[8016.68 - 8023.08] P:1384.91 E:0.096210 |  against Bukhayo Saka the right the right wing back as he is now throwing taken with Benesh
[8023.72 - 8029.64] P:1269.67 E:0.110457 |  and then Benesh gets it back the number 11 comes back to Skrinjar and Slavakir are actually
[8029.64 - 8034.04] P:1588.87 E:0.096815 |  building the pressure on England here 12 minutes played in the first period of extra time
[8034.60 - 8039.48] P:1379.96 E:0.099198 |  again Benesh who has looked bright since he came on to the field as this
[8042.20 - 8048.68] P:1503.65 E:0.110091 |  the number of the Slavak substitutes who have refreshed them Skrinjar on his right foot
[8048.68 - 8053.96] P:1597.78 E:0.113109 |  Skrinjar goes for the angle ball Pickford comes a long way and makes that catch that was very
[8053.96 - 8058.92] P:1574.39 E:0.115055 |  positive from Jordan Pickford and actually I think the flag's off the flag is up as well
[8058.92 - 8064.12] P:1408.91 E:0.110094 |  yeah I mean he had a long time to judge that ball it was floated in across diagonally across the
[8064.12 - 8069.64] P:1545.72 E:0.109604 |  box and he comes and trains it really nicely takes a bit of a bump rolls around on the floor a
[8069.64 - 8074.52] P:1443.56 E:0.098837 |  little bit now having a chat with a referee I mean yeah he knows what he's doing John in terms of
[8074.52 - 8080.76] P:1310.52 E:0.099944 |  running this clock down you've got a rice smile on your face Joe yeah he comes into his own here
[8080.76 - 8087.40] P:1578.38 E:0.091117 |  doesn't he yeah he kicks in doesn't he it does it really does kick in uh yeah fair play to him
[8089.48 - 8095.40] P:1542.01 E:0.098698 |  to one England League five live and the World Service it'll almost be straight into Spain
[8095.40 - 8102.44] P:1527.08 E:0.100715 |  Georgia after this then field it goes Walker trying to to keep up with Susloff and then the
[8102.44 - 8107.72] P:1714.89 E:0.111964 |  ball through the middle as over the challenge that might be a free kick no referee's not giving it
[8107.72 - 8113.16] P:1640.27 E:0.109524 |  for as a challenge an England break away with Palmer Palmer now Palmer is might have been fouled
[8113.16 - 8117.80] P:1665.36 E:0.107298 |  no he's kept his feet against Susloff there's only Tony in the middle Palmer cuts into the box
[8117.80 - 8123.72] P:1713.55 E:0.100509 |  Leopard and ball headed back to him Saka's in there Saka goes down England fans shout for a penalty
[8123.72 - 8128.84] P:1590.17 E:0.105482 |  but I don't think they had anything of a case there and Slavakir Airol to survive that is
[8128.84 - 8134.44] P:1483.33 E:0.107913 |  having in wins a throw a concede to throw in on the far side it's not even close to a penalty with
[8134.44 - 8139.16] P:1320.15 E:0.102738 |  Saka I know it England fans are going to appeal for that at this stage in the game but just opened
[8139.16 - 8144.44] P:1288.27 E:0.107543 |  up a little bit there for Slavakir a little bit fortunate as they does well actually gets himself
[8144.44 - 8149.72] P:1311.14 E:0.104522 |  back in position yes there's contact with the player but he's gold siding and he makes a really good
[8149.72 - 8158.76] P:1373.32 E:0.107525 |  run back into that hole Slavakir come again Palmer wins the ball but fouls his man and it's a free
[8158.76 - 8164.44] P:1573.82 E:0.094427 |  kick and we are now in the last minute of the first period of extra time here it's like he
[8164.44 - 8168.76] P:1422.27 E:0.108657 |  toes the ball away cleanly there Palmer I don't really see the offense there but maybe there's a
[8168.76 - 8176.12] P:1416.95 E:0.103810 |  slight contact on Slavakir and players foot before he wins the ball yeah Susloff free kick taken
[8176.76 - 8185.40] P:1357.49 E:0.100611 |  Slavakir back towards the halfway line it goes it's controlled there and played forward towards
[8185.40 - 8191.32] P:1482.02 E:0.101963 |  the left hand side Susloff slips the ball that's a nice ball into the penalty area then back and
[8191.32 - 8198.28] P:1506.19 E:0.100147 |  the across goal it goes and with the arriving Peckery at the back post the offside flag I think
[8198.28 - 8205.16] P:1493.70 E:0.094180 |  was up but Peckery lifted it over the bar what a warning for England it's over the bar whether
[8205.16 - 8210.60] P:1581.42 E:0.093272 |  it is I don't think it is offside it doesn't look offside he kind of comes from behind Eze but he
[8210.60 - 8215.80] P:1587.54 E:0.094190 |  knows how big a chance it is the 37 year old right back to get that high up at the pitch I mean
[8215.80 - 8220.44] P:1595.77 E:0.097846 |  we're just marveling the fact he's on the pitch John let alone flying up the wing and also that was
[8220.44 - 8224.44] P:1504.98 E:0.101508 |  one of the moves of the match yeah it was brilliant look like say the pass in to the centre forward
[8224.44 - 8228.76] P:1599.91 E:0.102752 |  who makes that little diagonal run into the corner of the 18 yard but sets the ball back for the cross
[8229.64 - 8234.76] P:1420.95 E:0.099081 |  and he's very nearly there just to bang that into the back post it was a good foot over the crossbar
[8234.76 - 8240.44] P:1624.94 E:0.089476 |  but any kind of different contact is in the back of the net one minute of added time at the end of
[8240.44 - 8248.52] P:1723.74 E:0.092422 |  this first period of extra time and the score remains England 2 Slovakia 1 Jordan Teckford
[8248.52 - 8252.68] P:1866.71 E:0.103316 |  with the ball just walks it out towards the edge of the penalty area referee says come on
[8253.48 - 8259.72] P:1531.30 E:0.095221 |  get rid of it which he does clearance downfield Kane the challenge for it have roll wins the
[8259.72 - 8265.48] P:1654.18 E:0.104312 |  header comes to Tony Tony involved in the goal for England that turned it around here a sacker now
[8266.44 - 8272.28] P:1718.67 E:0.097917 |  against Hans go ball into Palmer inside the penalty area Palmer keeps his feet and then plays
[8272.28 - 8279.48] P:1656.47 E:0.102881 |  it back to Rice Rice to his left to Ezzar and now Tony gives it away and there is the whistle
[8280.04 - 8288.76] P:1699.42 E:0.114967 |  for the end of the first period of extra time so England 15 minutes away now from a place in
[8288.76 - 8295.16] P:1608.23 E:0.100285 |  the quarter finals when at one stage right at the end of the 19 minutes and more there were
[8295.16 - 8302.12] P:1692.58 E:0.082931 |  seconds from going out half time in extra time England 2 Slovakia 1 still got to be careful
[8302.12 - 8307.64] P:1399.93 E:0.088481 |  haven't they Matt Oaksson absolutely just saw that Chappers really carved a lovely opportunity
[8307.64 - 8312.36] P:1300.66 E:0.094010 |  they've played some good football Slovakia make no mistake they're not just a team that wants to
[8312.36 - 8316.36] P:1305.30 E:0.100398 |  work hard off the ball when they've had it they put some really nice combinations together
[8317.32 - 8321.80] P:1656.85 E:0.101627 |  have they played the better combinations I know it seems slightly cheerlish to say that with
[8321.80 - 8327.72] P:1389.75 E:0.088140 |  England 2 on up but it do you think they have yes I think they've been slicker with their
[8327.72 - 8331.64] P:1473.79 E:0.095330 |  passing when they've had it and they've had those moments it's been one and two touch
[8331.64 - 8335.80] P:1498.48 E:0.097317 |  I mean the bot has been at the heart of a lot of it in terms of starting it nice angled runs the
[8335.80 - 8340.60] P:1471.32 E:0.093777 |  energy they've had to run and they've got wide players Chappers that will stay in that channel
[8340.60 - 8344.20] P:1406.29 E:0.097701 |  try and get in behind the defence and they've done it on several occasions and creating
[8344.20 - 8349.56] P:1474.27 E:0.092877 |  opportunities just like that one and to have the right back in that position at that stage of the
[8349.56 - 8354.60] P:1341.13 E:0.096197 |  game they've put some heart into this game I mean I really do feel for the position they're in
[8354.60 - 8359.32] P:1477.66 E:0.101655 |  they've been absolutely superb Izzy has had Consra and Gallagher waiting for a while to come on I
[8359.32 - 8364.20] P:1570.22 E:0.100375 |  wonder whether they will be the changes at this half time in extra time just to solidify it in a
[8364.20 - 8370.44] P:1488.38 E:0.099384 |  couple of areas definitely absolutely and I think our Southgate got them ready and then hung fire a
[8370.44 - 8374.68] P:1294.17 E:0.095938 |  little bit because I think he thought okay the team's in a good place right now wait until
[8374.68 - 8380.12] P:1506.99 E:0.103265 |  half time of extra time or maybe into the second period just to kind of delay it as well yeah just
[8380.12 - 8385.48] P:1527.60 E:0.097817 |  to delay it as a way to the ages before yeah yeah just to delay it a little bit but I think it makes a
[8385.48 - 8390.92] P:1367.96 E:0.098804 |  lot of sense to solidify things but it's incredible you know when they go 2 on up England the energy
[8390.92 - 8395.72] P:1441.20 E:0.108112 |  that I've seen from Jude Bellingham I know Matt and the guys up there have been saying that he looks
[8395.80 - 8400.76] P:1448.57 E:0.100561 |  tired and he is but he has found something deep within him and he's been running he has been
[8400.76 - 8403.72] P:1364.41 E:0.106111 |  running after things he shouldn't be running after in extra time let me tell you that
[8404.92 - 8409.40] P:1590.37 E:0.107853 |  so just trying to look at who's to be off and it looks like 9 and 10 John Murray
[8410.28 - 8419.00] P:1656.08 E:0.108707 |  yes it does Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham so on come Gallagher and Consra as well
[8419.24 - 8429.32] P:1627.41 E:0.097632 |  as we con that who we've heard the Aston Bellaman the number 14 has been doing very well in training
[8429.32 - 8436.36] P:1520.28 E:0.100814 |  has impressed caught the eye but Garas Southgate with 15 minutes to go there's still the possibility
[8436.36 - 8442.52] P:1587.38 E:0.093199 |  of penalties to come takes off two of his potential penalty takers yeah he does but I think he's
[8442.52 - 8446.68] P:1541.86 E:0.094428 |  he's making that judgment to say well I need to bring them off they're tired we also got to
[8447.24 - 8452.20] P:1557.35 E:0.100377 |  be picturing the fact that we could have a big game to come in a few days time and just want to
[8452.20 - 8457.96] P:1530.90 E:0.093420 |  shore things up I mean it's it's a tough game to come on out for someone like consa in a defensive
[8457.96 - 8464.92] P:1665.57 E:0.086129 |  role you know you've really got to have your wits about you you're only really potentially going
[8464.92 - 8468.60] P:1519.73 E:0.102161 |  to make a mistake or something crazy you know what I mean you're not going to send a forward coming
[8468.60 - 8473.08] P:1444.48 E:0.092410 |  on to win the game like Tony comes on so it's all about mentality and having that belief and he's
[8473.08 - 8479.08] P:1495.40 E:0.096571 |  very calm very assured he's been training well from what what I hear so for him to come on and
[8479.08 - 8485.00] P:1385.16 E:0.098788 |  have the his experience is brilliant as a defender but you do have to feel that you know there's a
[8485.00 - 8490.76] P:1455.99 E:0.097307 |  lot on it and you have to make good decisions and be really positive just adds to the nervousness of
[8490.76 - 8496.52] P:1459.67 E:0.099884 |  this afternoon job yeah I don't I don't think this is going to be a 15 16 minutes that we cruise I
[8496.52 - 8501.16] P:1339.23 E:0.105690 |  really don't it's just been the way that we've played this tournament and it's it's not exactly
[8501.24 - 8507.32] P:1344.57 E:0.107115 |  easy on the eye but the team need to find a way they really need to find a way and you know
[8507.32 - 8513.24] P:1355.23 E:0.111112 |  consa and Gallagher have got a huge part to play here and now it's consa mad at left back well yeah
[8513.24 - 8517.88] P:1225.71 E:0.103327 |  I mean he still looks a little bit of a back five almost I mean sack has dropped so deep on that right
[8517.88 - 8524.12] P:1266.58 E:0.099135 |  hand side I mean he's out just outside of Karl Walker so as your eyes look at it now it's a five
[8524.12 - 8528.20] P:1411.58 E:0.100041 |  but you'd think it would be a back four with consa at left back so back here coming forward the ball
[8528.20 - 8532.92] P:1783.16 E:0.100223 |  ricochets into the penalty area and Jordan Pickford's able to move across to his left after it came
[8532.92 - 8538.20] P:1742.91 E:0.098261 |  off John Stones and prevent the ball from going out for a corner so already into the second minute
[8538.20 - 8542.92] P:1483.09 E:0.101295 |  of the second period of extra time Slovakia have got one more change and they're going to bring on
[8543.80 - 8550.36] P:1537.52 E:0.099677 |  a forward Lubomir Tupta once the ball goes out of play that'll be their sixth and final change
[8550.36 - 8559.16] P:1302.76 E:0.098031 |  to one England lead and Tony loses out in the centre circle here is Peckery and then Vavro
[8560.04 - 8566.84] P:1437.52 E:0.102519 |  Vavro to Lobotka and Lobotka is able to cross the halfway line a little mobile figure that he is
[8566.84 - 8572.36] P:1568.72 E:0.101700 |  passes the ball through the middle to Buzheny but it breaks down and Tony is able to carry it forward
[8572.36 - 8578.12] P:1398.19 E:0.092979 |  then played back to Cona Gallagher Gallagher then back to Kyle Walker and out to Bukajosaka
[8578.12 - 8582.92] P:1589.96 E:0.099313 |  who's been put under pressure by Slovakia who seem to have found their press again don't they
[8582.92 - 8589.32] P:1670.94 E:0.097020 |  there's energetic press of theirs Mark Gaye now across to Esri Konza and then back to Gaye again
[8589.32 - 8595.32] P:1430.00 E:0.106382 |  on the edge of the box. Pickford takes it on to his right foot but uses his left to pass it across
[8595.32 - 8601.96] P:1460.63 E:0.099640 |  the penalty area where John Stones languidly passes it forward comes back to Slovakia then it's
[8601.96 - 8607.80] P:1462.39 E:0.101992 |  blocked back into the path of Suzlov but Gallagher I suppose that this is why Gallagher's come on for
[8607.80 - 8613.80] P:1510.20 E:0.100968 |  his energy in the latter period of extra time Gallagher again chasing the ball rice dives in
[8613.80 - 8620.36] P:1607.11 E:0.107979 |  with a challenge excellent from him and then Ezzar the baritie Ezzar is able to carry the ball forward
[8620.36 - 8626.76] P:1669.03 E:0.114116 |  downfield beats Longman oh and then is taken out by Vavro and the referee couldn't get his yellow
[8626.76 - 8631.32] P:1533.36 E:0.108055 |  card out of his puppy quickly enough for Dennis Vavro. Well we actually heard that up here it was
[8631.32 - 8637.32] P:1491.42 E:0.105372 |  some clatter from Vavro really just stepping with his hip and his shoulder as Ezzar just nudges the
[8637.32 - 8642.92] P:1399.59 E:0.102705 |  ball past him and runs into him I mean it's somebody checking so much the fact that Ezz is
[8642.92 - 8649.08] P:1476.97 E:0.086970 |  still laying on the floor he's not got up yet. The change is made and it is now Petter Pekareek
[8649.08 - 8655.40] P:1561.50 E:0.094980 |  who has been substituted what a shift from him to the 30s of a year old. Yeah I mean he had his
[8656.04 - 8661.32] P:1510.52 E:0.105397 |  very happy name day yesterday didn't he? He did yes he was able to celebrate that. He was and he's
[8661.32 - 8666.68] P:1425.32 E:0.092317 |  had a good day today I mean his performance you can't really pick any holes in any of their
[8666.68 - 8674.60] P:1516.94 E:0.095538 |  performances for Slovakia. Tupter has gone into sort of left wing position Lubomir Tupter of
[8675.48 - 8683.00] P:1397.51 E:0.103266 |  Slovan Liberets. What a battle this has been for England. Talk about lacking energy they've had
[8683.00 - 8690.04] P:1669.75 E:0.090246 |  to use every drop of energy here free kick taken by Gay. Three minutes almost four of this second
[8690.04 - 8698.76] P:1526.61 E:0.085367 |  period of extra time Slovakia come forward but Bero has to turn give it back in field to Lobotka
[8698.76 - 8705.72] P:1679.90 E:0.099066 |  Lobotka now looking forward with his pass as Income 2 England men. Rice is in there that's
[8705.72 - 8711.00] P:1680.38 E:0.097425 |  given as a free kick Gallagher and I think it was rice with the challenge and the free kick is
[8711.00 - 8716.20] P:1563.10 E:0.100615 |  free kick is won by Slovakia through the middle after Gallagher didn't quite get there and actually
[8716.20 - 8720.76] P:1632.09 E:0.099271 |  took down Tupter. Yeah it's a little bit unfortunate the ball just kind of ricochets it drops loose
[8720.76 - 8725.72] P:1712.38 E:0.100262 |  the other side of Gallagher he puts his right leg really outstretched just to win the ball back in
[8725.72 - 8731.56] P:1580.05 E:0.094472 |  and he makes contact and it's a it's a it's a funny distance this it's just one of those
[8731.56 - 8737.40] P:1474.48 E:0.091661 |  distances John that if you've got a player in the team that can hit the ball flat and just that
[8737.40 - 8744.12] P:1595.75 E:0.106515 |  dipping shot just go gets over the wall and bouncing with pace in front the goalkeeper can be really
[8744.12 - 8750.92] P:1696.67 E:0.100603 |  difficult. Tupter likes to look at this yeah and Jordan Pickford just leaning against his left post
[8750.92 - 8755.96] P:1698.03 E:0.101694 |  lining up the wall you do wonder it's been one of those tournament games whether there might be
[8755.96 - 8762.92] P:1739.44 E:0.100000 |  yet another twist in it. Tupter with his right foot from this free kick becomes chips ago with that
[8762.92 - 8767.48] P:1726.62 E:0.104902 |  Pickford was comfortable there and actually jumps up and hangs off the crossbar as it flies over
[8767.48 - 8772.92] P:1679.67 E:0.103034 |  by a couple of yards to the cheers of the England fans behind where is he Christensen is standing
[8773.48 - 8779.00] P:1637.92 E:0.099341 |  and he is a goal kick. Yeah he tries to hit exactly that shot that kind of Ronaldo-esque
[8779.00 - 8783.88] P:1540.94 E:0.101456 |  dipping flat hit with the boot where it just goes over and moves about in front of the goalkeeper
[8783.88 - 8790.28] P:1669.03 E:0.097354 |  but he just can't keep it down too much height on it and he just blazes over the bar. Ten minutes
[8790.28 - 8796.92] P:1573.40 E:0.101913 |  to go England 2 Slovakia 1 you're listening to us on the World Service and on Five Live
[8797.56 - 8804.84] P:1511.13 E:0.104796 |  tomorrow morning we've got more county championship cricket on the BBC Wimbledon begins tomorrow two
[8804.84 - 8811.08] P:1272.60 E:0.103248 |  more commentaries but what drama we've had here in Gelsenkirchen as England try to see this out
[8811.08 - 8818.28] P:1378.15 E:0.091057 |  for what would be only their second win of the tournament when it seemed almost gone for them.
[8818.84 - 8824.68] P:1437.29 E:0.106197 |  As Ivan Tony ball is presented to him hope that was a foul by Gallagher it is
[8825.64 - 8830.36] P:1601.33 E:0.095796 |  they complain about it but it was just a little over exuberant into the challenge
[8830.92 - 8839.72] P:1449.72 E:0.094983 |  and England are now in danger of just sitting on it free kick to be taken by Benish and so
[8839.72 - 8846.36] P:1576.93 E:0.097951 |  up they go. Benish takes this left footed headed away by Eza somebody's thrown a ball back onto
[8846.36 - 8852.68] P:1594.16 E:0.101634 |  the pitch so we've got two balls on the pitch so that's sliced away over the hoardings throwing
[8853.56 - 8857.96] P:1563.70 E:0.101986 |  for Babro and actually the ball's thrown back on by the England fans. Still on the pitch.
[8858.60 - 8861.80] P:1473.40 E:0.126905 |  Still on the pitch when he popped off the advertising hoardings and come back in
[8862.84 - 8866.36] P:1604.19 E:0.102950 |  England fans enjoying that one. I hope that wasn't Izzy throwing that back onto the field
[8866.36 - 8870.92] P:1659.96 E:0.099654 |  it's down to her end. Throwing is taken here's the cross that's blocked on the edge of the six-yard
[8870.92 - 8875.96] P:1714.42 E:0.096343 |  box by Konza out of play for another throw England are coming under pressure here
[8876.04 - 8882.20] P:1613.74 E:0.095974 |  it's not over yet long throw by Barrow here it is into the penalty area rice gets up couldn't
[8882.20 - 8887.08] P:1647.62 E:0.102619 |  reach it bounces down rice clears it on the turn only though back to Barrow his cross into the
[8887.08 - 8894.60] P:1679.71 E:0.106462 |  back post is cleared away by Walker oh just over the head just over the head of Hanscoe.
[8895.24 - 8899.56] P:1641.26 E:0.105211 |  Slovakia come again suddenly they're taking great encouragement from this
[8899.56 - 8904.68] P:1592.39 E:0.115371 |  Suzlov on his left foot and it goes into the penalty area and it's allowed to bounce all the way through
[8905.96 - 8911.56] P:1671.43 E:0.111466 |  and Kyle Walker is is enveloped by a Jordan Pickford hook for allowing that through for
[8911.56 - 8917.80] P:1584.58 E:0.107901 |  goal kick. Well Hanscoe was an intro way from making this game level there any kind of contact on
[8917.80 - 8922.52] P:1575.39 E:0.103291 |  that delivery it was a lovely left foot in swinging delivery into the box and he jumps
[8922.52 - 8928.12] P:1589.46 E:0.095962 |  it's going through loads of bodies and he just can't get any contact must have grazed the hair on
[8928.12 - 8931.08] P:1450.46 E:0.100180 |  his head but any touch would have been big trouble for England.
[8931.48 - 8939.80] P:1412.22 E:0.099878 |  Pickford with the free kick some England fans begin twirling their shirts above their heads
[8940.44 - 8948.20] P:1266.18 E:0.108005 |  on this actually by recent standards comparatively cool evening still shirt sleeve weather Tony
[8948.20 - 8955.96] P:1269.91 E:0.101243 |  concede to free kick and so Barrow again to the right hand side to Barrow Barrow's ball in to the
[8955.96 - 8960.44] P:1300.06 E:0.106645 |  edge of the box John Stones comes across is able to carefully head that away to Declan Rice who
[8960.44 - 8967.88] P:1469.22 E:0.106107 |  controls it and now called Tarma with his balance keeps possession there's a little wiggle of his
[8967.88 - 8972.68] P:1465.65 E:0.097673 |  hips there as well from the Chelsea man and then it's back towards the edge of the penalty area
[8972.68 - 8978.20] P:1569.00 E:0.096200 |  John Stones out to Kyle Walker on the far side Walker is able to keep possession plays the factor
[8978.20 - 8983.00] P:1579.52 E:0.117401 |  Stones long pass from him to the halfway line to Tony who's been fouled he's been shoved over
[8983.56 - 8988.20] P:1613.65 E:0.112409 |  by Jim Bear and actually as a yellow card I think for the protest as much as anything else
[8988.28 - 8992.12] P:1552.21 E:0.105225 |  and it's a chance for England to take a few moments or that there's Tony stayed on the ground
[8992.12 - 8997.40] P:1378.36 E:0.103550 |  yeah John Bear hasn't managed to get to grips with Ivan Tony who's done his job since coming on
[8997.40 - 9002.44] P:1388.43 E:0.114982 |  he's done very well he's just used his body so any long ball that gets cleared up the pitch
[9002.44 - 9007.64] P:1425.21 E:0.114392 |  he's backing in he's making life difficult for the centre back he's drawing fouls he even gets a
[9007.64 - 9012.28] P:1383.78 E:0.118139 |  book in there and he wins a free kick and an important time for England we were looking a
[9012.28 - 9017.80] P:1365.00 E:0.109599 |  little bit shaky a little bit defensive sat on the edge of our own 18-yard box we're now able to get
[9017.80 - 9021.88] P:1527.68 E:0.107329 |  all the way up the pitch if you're on the way home the highlights of this are on later tonight
[9021.88 - 9027.00] P:1490.42 E:0.104711 |  1045 BBC 2 or on the iPlayer and as I say via Stones if you want to you can listen back to
[9027.00 - 9033.80] P:1501.93 E:0.098146 |  this commentary it's a roller coaster 2-1 England League as a free kick has hit four as a as
[9033.80 - 9040.44] P:1401.39 E:0.103814 |  or is able to take it down into the full back position but Slovakia were able to to win it back
[9041.16 - 9048.28] P:1185.56 E:0.114063 |  and rice herring after the ball the effort that he's put into this game Deflan Rice
[9049.00 - 9055.24] P:1512.43 E:0.104378 |  LeBotka again he's the big hope for Slovakia it's a long pass towards the edge of the penalty
[9055.24 - 9062.28] P:1576.19 E:0.101854 |  area where it's carried out towards the far side and back it goes to LeBotka once more
[9062.28 - 9069.48] P:1573.02 E:0.098195 |  England drop back white shirts behind the ball Fabro now again to the right hand side to Beiro
[9070.20 - 9074.60] P:1734.11 E:0.107750 |  Fabro on the right wing the central defender and that's blocked behind by
[9074.60 - 9078.68] P:1755.36 E:0.097758 |  gay for a corner which are looping to take quickly this is their first corner of the
[9078.68 - 9083.48] P:1702.59 E:0.092493 |  match Slovakia they've been on top the last five minutes England have to be careful here's another
[9083.48 - 9088.44] P:1555.91 E:0.099495 |  ball flying into the box and you can bet there's going to be a blue shirt flying towards the ball
[9088.44 - 9093.16] P:1622.52 E:0.106341 |  they're so committed in these situations some big man finished to take there's no other referees
[9093.16 - 9099.16] P:1575.30 E:0.097171 |  not ready so Jordan Pickford steps out of his six yard box and and just not sure who he was
[9099.16 - 9106.28] P:1635.07 E:0.087808 |  shouting at there but Benesh will come again to take this corner from the right hand side England
[9108.12 - 9115.16] P:1534.53 E:0.098391 |  need to stand up strong here could take it short Benesh with the the left foot delivery into the
[9115.16 - 9120.28] P:1744.83 E:0.103057 |  edge of the six yard area Ivan Tony was there to head it away for England and then Ezzar
[9120.36 - 9125.72] P:1665.91 E:0.104859 |  the folly's it downfield goalkeeper to Bravka races out of his penalty area to control this
[9126.28 - 9131.72] P:1569.01 E:0.093802 |  we've got four minutes of added time four minutes of extra time to play
[9133.24 - 9139.80] P:1394.60 E:0.098701 |  and Slovakia attacking through the middle bounces back to the centre circle to Fabro
[9139.80 - 9145.56] P:1519.42 E:0.097605 |  now towards the left hand side LeBotka Slovakia dominating possession now England have dropped
[9145.56 - 9149.88] P:1667.85 E:0.104217 |  right off them Fabro takes it on forward passes it to the right hand side
[9150.44 - 9155.56] P:1800.92 E:0.107002 |  Suzlov is there his crosses blocked out of play to throw into Slovakia down the right by the way
[9155.56 - 9160.04] P:1701.47 E:0.100928 |  that Spain Georgia game is going to start on sports extra so we can hear from the
[9160.04 - 9165.24] P:1608.08 E:0.105694 |  England camp and react to this game two balls on the pitch one's been knocked off the pitch and then
[9165.24 - 9173.64] P:1805.26 E:0.101938 |  the shot from the angle by Bozhenik into the side netting and it is a goal kick to England
[9173.72 - 9176.84] P:1620.54 E:0.099987 |  that's up some of it interesting if that had gone in the back of the net because
[9176.84 - 9180.44] P:1522.43 E:0.097963 |  there were two balls there were two balls so technically the game probably should have stopped
[9180.44 - 9184.84] P:1529.66 E:0.099755 |  the referee allowed play on ridiculous angle to try and score from you're never going to be able
[9184.84 - 9190.36] P:1490.16 E:0.097451 |  to beat the goalkeeper from from that kind of tight angle Joe Hart it feels like England are
[9190.36 - 9195.64] P:1611.96 E:0.097637 |  kind of in Normans land here at the moment yeah they are you know they've been guilty of that every
[9195.64 - 9200.76] P:1497.92 E:0.108027 |  time they've taken the lead in this tournament but it feels like it's a moment where they just need
[9200.76 - 9205.80] P:1718.67 E:0.101628 |  to get over the line and then and deal with the deal with whatever falls out from it after but yeah
[9205.80 - 9210.68] P:1575.08 E:0.107822 |  it's been it's such a shame when you see them being so dominant I understand Slovakia was sitting in
[9210.68 - 9214.76] P:1415.63 E:0.107055 |  trying to hang on to the result but this team can dominate when it's in the right mood but
[9215.32 - 9220.20] P:1482.31 E:0.101243 |  the moment they take the lead they're just so cautious it's amazing the psychology behind
[9220.20 - 9225.96] P:1406.22 E:0.104153 |  after the goals isn't it to be so dominant and let's say to score that second was two one
[9226.92 - 9231.16] P:1428.12 E:0.102960 |  you know Slovakia are crushed at that moment and to then have that psychology to then not
[9231.72 - 9235.88] P:1551.59 E:0.099793 |  keep taking the game there and you end up in this situation where you're now
[9235.88 - 9240.04] P:1455.93 E:0.094768 |  hanging on the edge of your own 18-yard box and defending to to win the game and that's what
[9240.04 - 9244.20] P:1707.34 E:0.099209 |  they're doing two minutes to see this out two minutes to see it out for a place in the quarter
[9244.20 - 9250.20] P:1580.73 E:0.094388 |  finals but it is Slovakia in possession Conigalega hairs after the ball Lebotka has got it then it
[9250.20 - 9256.52] P:1686.94 E:0.105922 |  comes in field towards the captain Skriniar then back from Skriniar to Lebotka one two three four
[9256.52 - 9261.48] P:1662.10 E:0.104348 |  five six Slovakia players near the edge of the England penalty area as I look down here
[9261.48 - 9266.92] P:1549.66 E:0.103800 |  Skriniar again Skriniar finds the pass to the right hand side to Barrow Barrow slips it past
[9266.92 - 9274.04] P:1504.52 E:0.090158 |  Konza now Suslov on the right hand side Suslov then back for the ball in from the right and it
[9274.04 - 9280.28] P:1722.76 E:0.106020 |  is headed up in the air but wide and Kyle Walker did his best there to put the challenge in and make
[9280.28 - 9288.12] P:1766.29 E:0.103212 |  sure that that was not a clean header on goal and it bounced wide at the far post for a goal kick to
[9288.12 - 9294.20] P:1625.84 E:0.105981 |  England from the head of Hancock. You need to be ready when that ball is wide they've got one thing
[9294.20 - 9299.00] P:1677.76 E:0.106180 |  in their mind it's coming in the ball is getting delivered into the box and there's blue shirts
[9299.00 - 9305.16] P:1497.48 E:0.106598 |  arriving so defending that 18-yard box for England when the ball is wide is so key can we hang on and
[9305.16 - 9310.68] P:1674.12 E:0.102821 |  just see this game through. What an effort from Slovakia I think we're going to have to feel a
[9310.68 - 9315.72] P:1461.13 E:0.111345 |  little for them absolutely with that they've played here today that is to be defeated and exit at the
[9315.72 - 9323.64] P:1299.57 E:0.105144 |  round of 16 again for them that England they are now seconds away I make it we've got 40 seconds to go
[9324.60 - 9333.80] P:1379.83 E:0.109725 |  England equalised almost right at the end of normal time now Slovakia with Lebotka they know
[9333.80 - 9340.28] P:1579.93 E:0.105283 |  time's almost up for them the pass through the middle Tony puts his foot in here's Vabro Suslov
[9340.28 - 9346.04] P:1588.85 E:0.103528 |  again on the right Suslov against Konza left footed ball into the box headed away Walker got a good
[9346.04 - 9352.28] P:1624.75 E:0.108453 |  header in on that still inside the penalty area and then away it is by Konza and it calls it the
[9352.28 - 9358.52] P:1576.46 E:0.116394 |  feet of Tony and England could run away now and break away with Parma they do Slovakia have only
[9358.52 - 9365.88] P:1468.50 E:0.112294 |  got one man back Tony and Eze Parma tries to find Eze bounces to Tony Tony blasts it over from the
[9365.88 - 9371.72] P:1525.37 E:0.111156 |  edge of the penalty area that would have finished it Tony slats on his back waiting to add a time
[9371.72 - 9377.08] P:1456.47 E:0.105353 |  now there's one minute of added time before England are through to the quarterfinals. When he goes for
[9377.08 - 9382.28] P:1553.20 E:0.108242 |  power here Tony the ball just falls to him he has a touch on his right foot if he hits the target
[9382.28 - 9386.84] P:1540.94 E:0.107734 |  it's in because he's hit it with so much power but just blazes it about a yard over the crossbar.
[9388.28 - 9396.84] P:1558.71 E:0.104653 |  30 seconds to go England lead 2-1 England who are almost out Slovakia have to come forward
[9398.04 - 9403.96] P:1777.86 E:0.113420 |  their coach Calzona is urging them on he's almost on the pitch Suslov now on the right hand side
[9404.44 - 9409.08] P:1761.88 E:0.108982 |  Suslov as Slovakia looked for the goal that would take it to penalties right foot cross that was
[9409.08 - 9414.12] P:1732.16 E:0.110525 |  excellent it's headed down Pickford dives to his right and is able to gather the ball and
[9414.12 - 9419.96] P:1664.75 E:0.112511 |  fall flat on his face and hold on to it Harry Kane's there on the edge of the coaching area Pickford
[9419.96 - 9426.84] P:1664.48 E:0.105632 |  gets up he twirls his fist that orange glove to the England fans I think he thinks that that is it
[9426.84 - 9433.32] P:1648.00 E:0.110813 |  and the referee says that is it and England have come through it and Garrard Southgate and Steve Holland
[9434.28 - 9441.80] P:1545.16 E:0.112637 |  hook one another and all of his coaches now in an embrace what an emotional effort this has been
[9442.52 - 9449.80] P:1567.25 E:0.111894 |  England players are down on the pitch Slovakia are out what an effort from them they were so close
[9449.80 - 9454.76] P:1542.90 E:0.110403 |  to going through I think a yellow card's been shown down there on the pitch as well whether that
[9454.76 - 9462.28] P:1527.47 E:0.099823 |  was Suslov and actually the the coach Calzona is having words with Declan Rice and I think
[9462.36 - 9468.92] P:1408.91 E:0.112037 |  Calzona pushed away Declan Rice and now Tempazart off-reying there and the Slovakia coaches
[9468.92 - 9475.24] P:1348.44 E:0.103668 |  is right in the middle of this and players generally milling around but what an effort that is from
[9475.24 - 9482.44] P:1453.32 E:0.105093 |  England it looks as though the story was coming to an end for Garrard Southgate as England manager
[9483.00 - 9491.08] P:1232.91 E:0.118890 |  for his team at this tournament and somehow Jude Valingham an incredible unforgettable
[9491.08 - 9498.04] P:1448.92 E:0.122524 |  overhead kick and then Harry Kane with a header right at the start of extra time and England have won
[9498.04 - 9505.72] P:1333.21 E:0.118339 |  two-one and England are through into the quarterfinals for a fourth time in four tournaments under
[9505.72 - 9513.80] P:1461.83 E:0.112325 |  Garrard Southgate it'll be England Switzerland on Saturday Manipsen, Johard, shoot England only
[9513.80 - 9519.64] P:1471.81 E:0.096870 |  Garrard Southgate only gets to the set of the quarterfinals minimum jump and that's happened again
[9519.64 - 9526.76] P:1645.01 E:0.092204 |  today how it's happened I don't quite know to be honest it's just been the most bizarre game
[9527.40 - 9533.64] P:1383.78 E:0.101308 |  you have to take a step back and look at how bad England have played in moments in this game and
[9533.64 - 9541.32] P:1522.14 E:0.103549 |  how Slovakia must feel I can see why Francisco Calzona is frustrated and airing that frustration
[9541.32 - 9547.08] P:1385.25 E:0.109327 |  because he thinks they're calm down now they have but his team were just absolutely superb
[9547.08 - 9552.92] P:1240.03 E:0.115878 |  he's congratulating them in the middle of the centre circle and rightly so they gave everything
[9552.92 - 9557.72] P:1052.80 E:0.121020 |  they were excellent they were better than us in certain moments and throughout a lot of the game
[9557.72 - 9562.68] P:1273.00 E:0.116180 |  they had a structure they had a plan they pressed they worked they played when they got the ball
[9562.68 - 9567.56] P:1480.41 E:0.124751 |  and England have just hung on and got through it just watching Garrard Southgate just to see what he
[9567.56 - 9572.36] P:1458.63 E:0.124098 |  does now he's in a big embrace with Jude Valingham and I'm not surprised after what Valingham's done
[9572.36 - 9578.68] P:1463.30 E:0.122485 |  for him today yeah that was a big moment and obviously he's put a lot of a lot of trust in him
[9578.68 - 9582.60] P:1777.99 E:0.110413 |  I'm just thinking there Matt you said I don't know how to explain what's gone on there because I expect
[9582.60 - 9588.04] P:1705.21 E:0.105896 |  my the hairs and the back of my neck to be stood up but they're not I don't know I'm aware of what
[9588.04 - 9593.64] P:1797.78 E:0.086066 |  happened in the game and yeah they were they were yeah I don't really know what to say do you feel
[9593.64 - 9597.72] P:1885.37 E:0.107627 |  flat I do yeah I think I feel like I should be absolutely buzzing and don't get me wrong that
[9597.72 - 9603.56] P:1955.42 E:0.096219 |  the crowd's getting behind it and sweet Caroline's playing but it's going to have to be a huge
[9603.56 - 9608.60] P:1869.55 E:0.111111 |  improvement for us to get anything out of the game on Saturday that's all that's running through my mind
[9608.60 - 9613.80] P:1728.02 E:0.109150 |  well listen there will be a 100th match for Garrard Southgate as the England manager it'll be the
[9613.80 - 9621.80] P:1754.16 E:0.099765 |  quarterfinal on Saturday after it finished here England 2 Slovakia 1 after extra time Mark Chapman
[9622.52 - 9628.52] P:1777.40 E:0.093916 |  well England have some England have provided some drama finally but first of all Joe welcome to the
[9628.52 - 9635.00] P:1819.32 E:0.107582 |  last 20 years I'm sitting here judging but I've just more trouble than these guys I've trust me
[9635.00 - 9639.88] P:1799.42 E:0.103668 |  just trying to work out what we've what we've seen and trying to find a bit out what you would say
[9639.88 - 9646.28] P:1755.13 E:0.096352 |  is he and maybe the big this is the biggest thing that might change after tonight the energy is
[9646.28 - 9651.32] P:1803.28 E:0.100853 |  different yeah now what's more interesting now is Southgate's on his own in front of the England
[9651.32 - 9657.24] P:1859.46 E:0.095806 |  fans so he'll be interested to see what the response is here it's more positive yeah I mean the fans
[9657.24 - 9662.52] P:1735.70 E:0.098137 |  are just they just want to win and for me there's enough in that performance there I completely agree
[9662.52 - 9667.48] P:1854.68 E:0.095759 |  with Joe you know the performance on the whole Slovakia were the better team you know in and
[9667.48 - 9672.12] P:1773.64 E:0.092604 |  out of possession but there were moments in that game where I think you can cling on to that and you
[9672.12 - 9677.00] P:1723.37 E:0.095428 |  can take that forward and massive massive moment from Jude Bellingham it must have been about 30
[9677.00 - 9681.48] P:1885.14 E:0.087974 |  seconds left on the clock and he's done a bicycle kick to equalize to take it to extra time and then
[9681.48 - 9687.16] P:1844.92 E:0.091556 |  Harry Kane two set pieces two goals and the set pieces have been awful this tournament so far from
[9687.16 - 9691.64] P:1805.26 E:0.093422 |  England but I think there's enough in that there's character we said before the game the players were
[9691.64 - 9695.56] P:1810.75 E:0.091272 |  going to have to dig deep and they were the pilots they were the ones who were going to have to sort
[9695.56 - 9700.60] P:1835.40 E:0.087395 |  this out and some big players have stepped up in big moments when their countries needed them so
[9700.60 - 9708.28] P:1865.98 E:0.089916 |  they've got to capture that move forward. So for Garos Southgate now that's his 13th win at a World Cup
[9708.28 - 9713.88] P:1774.34 E:0.092169 |  or a European Championship that's a record for an England manager and he's now won seven knockout
[9713.88 - 9720.68] P:1871.75 E:0.095873 |  matches which is a record for an England manager. There are more games at tournaments and in between
[9720.68 - 9728.28] P:1856.66 E:0.088364 |  1966 and 2016 that's a lot of tournaments and a lot of matches England won six knockout matches
[9728.28 - 9733.16] P:1899.42 E:0.091529 |  but there are more games at tournaments. There are more games at tournaments but in in a period of
[9733.88 - 9740.36] P:1892.41 E:0.093530 |  well half a century they weren't able to win as many as that. Look you've done all of the you've
[9740.36 - 9746.12] P:1867.81 E:0.090903 |  done all of the England games here do you think there's a change in energy? Just from just from
[9746.12 - 9750.44] P:1840.01 E:0.093712 |  because they weren't look for the majority of that game those England fans have not been happy
[9750.44 - 9755.32] P:1898.76 E:0.094265 |  and they haven't. We know how sport works and how psychology works and you know I referred back to
[9755.32 - 9761.24] P:1832.90 E:0.097188 |  1990 when England were as flat as a pancake under Bobby Robson got a very hard labour dramatic
[9761.24 - 9768.12] P:1843.95 E:0.088592 |  win against Belgium and it changed the mood. Yeah up against another very organised team in the next
[9768.12 - 9773.00] P:1817.65 E:0.091742 |  round in the court finals with that little bit more quality you know we've been praising Slovakia
[9773.00 - 9777.40] P:1798.60 E:0.101385 |  today and they did they did they played out of their skins but they'd never overly threatened us did
[9777.40 - 9784.60] P:1832.20 E:0.094766 |  they there was a few chances but Switzerland yeah let's see. It's not ideal I don't want to rely on
[9785.48 - 9789.16] P:1761.95 E:0.103370 |  that. Yeah you don't you don't want to have to sit here and rely on things oh my god is anyone
[9789.16 - 9794.12] P:1858.03 E:0.092755 |  going to turn up and produce something like what we've just seen there is is it's a bit crazy isn't
[9794.12 - 9799.48] P:1859.97 E:0.092502 |  it it's ridiculous you want you want it to be set you want it to be organised you want it to be
[9799.48 - 9804.84] P:1831.84 E:0.096094 |  fluid and happening and bang that's how you win but even a winning match is in this fashion so
[9805.56 - 9810.52] P:1850.74 E:0.107098 |  the crowd behind the goal is drama and they're out probably go home happy. And that's what I find
[9810.52 - 9816.28] P:1850.10 E:0.094034 |  fascinating in all of this because right at the death they've come back they aren't going out everybody
[9816.28 - 9822.68] P:1842.70 E:0.094452 |  is absolutely bouncing from the messages I'm getting from back home people are bouncing back home
[9822.68 - 9829.00] P:1863.27 E:0.092672 |  because they've gone from going out to going through in the space of five or six minutes.
[9829.56 - 9835.00] P:1844.95 E:0.092962 |  What what's interesting I think is how they reflect on that yeah and how everybody else in the cold
[9835.00 - 9840.84] P:1858.39 E:0.094396 |  like a day will reflect on that I thought I said to you after the last group game I'm a bit confused
[9840.84 - 9846.92] P:1835.28 E:0.095481 |  here about how we sort of analyse all of this and now as you've said John I'm even I'm even more
[9846.92 - 9853.08] P:1885.66 E:0.090396 |  confused you know really it's like job done through. But surely there has to be a performance in this
[9853.08 - 9857.48] P:1795.73 E:0.097810 |  England team there has to be a performance and the more games you play it would follow the more
[9857.48 - 9863.80] P:1838.87 E:0.087591 |  chance that there will be that performance. The beauty about this sport is that a good team will
[9863.80 - 9868.52] P:1827.31 E:0.087885 |  beat a team of good players. That's brilliant that's why we love it that's why we watch games like
[9868.52 - 9874.44] P:1860.47 E:0.088795 |  this today and credit to to Slovakia was just to a man was just brilliant and they were better
[9874.44 - 9881.16] P:1868.33 E:0.076054 |  they performed better than us miles better than us today for what they're capable of and that's why
[9881.16 - 9887.00] P:1854.39 E:0.086981 |  the sport's so great so that will always out trump great individuals there's no that history will tell
[9887.00 - 9892.20] P:1830.22 E:0.088563 |  you that but you can win football matches in the way that we're doing because we're doing it right
[9892.20 - 9897.32] P:1793.06 E:0.086484 |  now whether or not we'll be a better team who plays to their maximum that's a different question
[9897.32 - 9901.16] P:1807.00 E:0.094423 |  and that's going to be the next challenge on Saturday and if you're in that England camp Joe
[9901.16 - 9908.76] P:1848.11 E:0.081855 |  now and if you're Garasavka you go that's that's you get out of jail that should get out of jail
[9908.76 - 9914.36] P:1810.04 E:0.092847 |  now sees that moment. Yeah I think so because there would have been moments obviously with the way
[9914.36 - 9918.84] P:1867.70 E:0.096235 |  that things have gone in the group stages and the feeling and the reflections you know as much as
[9918.92 - 9922.92] P:1884.65 E:0.093957 |  they say they won't see it they'll they'll have felt it there would have been a feeling and I felt
[9922.92 - 9927.80] P:1850.97 E:0.091346 |  that feeling and I've actually gone the other way and followed through with it that oh my goodness
[9927.80 - 9931.72] P:1886.15 E:0.089808 |  me we're going to go out here I mean this is going to cause an awful lot of trouble an awful
[9931.72 - 9937.56] P:1846.46 E:0.088278 |  lot of trouble it's not a nice feeling it's a helpless feeling and then that huge moment that
[9937.56 - 9941.08] P:1820.13 E:0.099758 |  Jude Bellingham moment I'm so pleased that you've just said chappers there that people are happy at
[9941.08 - 9946.04] P:1835.85 E:0.091236 |  home I want I want English fans to be happy I want them to be feeling I want them to be rejoicing I
[9946.04 - 9952.04] P:1907.51 E:0.089708 |  want the you know I want sweet Caroline being belted out but the team will yeah let's cash the
[9952.04 - 9956.28] P:1899.78 E:0.094912 |  get out of jail free card and let's go let's build on it let's get behind them and let's see what
[9956.28 - 9960.04] P:1667.88 E:0.089844 |  happens people are happy because they've been entertaining you can't deny that was an entertaining
[9960.04 - 9964.52] P:1638.96 E:0.092005 |  game of football I mean we're emotions are all over the place and you come away and you're you're
[9964.52 - 9970.44] P:1878.41 E:0.079984 |  you're quite thrilled about it but I don't think you can change what this is now we're too far you
[9970.44 - 9976.36] P:1926.59 E:0.086262 |  can't change what these performances are it's not that simple if we were to be told that England
[9976.36 - 9981.00] P:1905.47 E:0.081732 |  have won this tournament I think the only way they're gonna we're gonna win it is by exactly what's
[9981.00 - 9987.40] P:1860.72 E:0.091714 |  just happened there incredible moments moments of madness individuals turn up and produce individual
[9987.40 - 9992.60] P:1780.43 E:0.093932 |  bit of brilliance mistakes it doesn't feel like it's gonna be one from a free flow but as I keep
[9993.16 - 9997.88] P:1843.78 E:0.093023 |  saying that you know Italy Portugal the previous two winners when they were not setting this tournament
[9997.88 - 10000.68] P:1923.37 E:0.060967 |  alive
