 Anustacio in midfield, Buchanan, Hoylert, Lariat, Nottingham Forest player who's currently on loan at Toronto FC and Jonathan David, the highly rated Jonathan David up front. So this is Belgium, Canada in Group F and the match begins and the ball is immediately played back to goalkeeper Boyan to our right, the Canadian side in the white shirts with the red numbers and Belgium in these rather vivid red shirts with the black sleeves, black shorts and black and red socks. So this is the fourth and final commentary today from here in the Gulf at this World Cup and it is the star studded Belgians, the team ranked number two in the world. Once again here they are setting out an attempt to win what would be Belgium's first major senior tournament title and it is the Canadians in possession inside their own heart but that's a poor pass. It's given away to Batuay and Batuay shoots for goal and it's deflected but it's deflected relatively close to Boyan the goalkeeper who's able to drop down to his left and hold onto it. I don't know whether that was nerves or what it was Dion Dublin but it wasn't very good from... No it wasn't and you can't make those kind of mistakes at all, not this early in the game anyway against the team right Belgium. You cannot, he has Junior Hoylert now on the left hand side, Junior Hoylert now of Reading taking the ball under the full back position, crossing for the near post and it is cleared away. The ball is blocked by the right hand side and now Jonathan David in the middle but they have it back Alfonso Davis, Alfonso Davis real quality there with the number 19 on his back, cuts in field he's on his right foot, little ball towards the edge of the area, David turns it out towards the right hand side and now on the overlap Johnston tries to get the crossing, that is blocked by Carrasco, it bounces back to Alastair Johnson the right back and Canada this is much better from them, into the penalty area they go and well enough by Ustaccio the Porto man, the midfielder inside the box but it was blocked out source just a couple of yards away the Belgian defender and they were able to get it away so there we are in the first two minutes, Canada very very bad at the back but actually pretty good at the front. Yes sharp moving it about from the left hand side over to the right hand side two players combining well, little one two as well, last ditch defence from Belgium but they weren't expecting that in the first five minutes. No I bet they weren't so great day this for Canada making only their second appearance at a World Cup and their English coach John Herdman down there in Newcastle United supporter from County Durham and it looked like was that a late challenge on Fertonga the ball had already gone and it was late from Buchanan the midfielder but I think Fertonga will be okay Dion. Yeah he'll be fine just a bit of a body check there just caught him while his weight wasn't on his right foot knocked him over he's fine I was watching actually the warm up before the game started and Michy Bacciari looks very very sharp he put a few shots in the top corners as well so he is wanting to get on the score sheet as all good centre forwards will want to but he's looking sharp I feel for this defence tonight. Yep so it is 0-0 very early stages Bacciari in very decent goal scoring form for Fener Bacciari 8 goals this season but Canada have won the ball back and it's played out towards the right hand side Buchanan is there double step over from Buchanan of against Carrasco chosen by Roberto Martinez as the left wing back there was some debate over who that would be but it's Carrasco who got the nod and he's been able to concede a throw in on the far side so Alastair Johnson this well thought of right back Blontair short Blontair takes the throw but that's a poor touch actually from Hutchinson and the ball is out of play for a throw in to Belgium so yes tonight in Doha Canada become only the second team from their country to play at a men's World Cup and they have the chance tonight to become the first Canadian team to actually score a goal at the World Cup and to win a point at the World Cup and it is Belgium clearing the ball away with Fatonga who is okay Alderviro that bounces to left footed clearance from him on the edge of the box and then there's a foul on the halfway line by Batchewa he was putting it about a bit quite a physical challenge that Chouay sort of turns and points to his own chest as if to say to the referee what a foul. Yeah he sort of I think he called to Victoria there didn't even know he was there to be honest just turn he was there and he just caught his shoulder knocked him over referee pulled it back for a free kick. The referee by the way is Yanni Zikazoui of Zambia who you might remember from the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year this was the referee who twice blew the final whistle early during the Tunisia-Mali match during the the Cup of Nations first in the 86th minute realized his mistake then said carry on and then actually blew the final whistle on 89 minutes and 47 seconds when Mali were leading 1-0 it caused quite a fuss at the time and when I saw that he was refereeing this game I have to say I was slightly surprised but clearly FIFA have confidence in him otherwise he wouldn't be here and everyone makes mistakes even though that was quite a big one. Have you made a mistake on this? Yeah I have to make mistakes every day. Belgium NIL, Canada NIL, Victoria playing the ball back to goalkeeper Bojan who passes it out from the back and then the ball is deflected by Carasco out of play for a throwing to Canada. Actually the officials tonight is very very much a league of nations affair in that the referee is from Zambia the assistants are from Colombia and Algeria the fourth officials from Japan and the VAR the main VAR official is from Venezuela so they're hoping I think for international understanding between the officials tonight. Here it is with Belgium playing it forward towards the edge of the box that's headed away by Johnston it bounces down now for Carasco and Carasco turns but in comes the challenge on him good one as well it was to win it back for Canada from Ustakio and then Carasco tries to win it back but fails and falls on his backside and now Buchanan on the right hand side and his cross into the middle is actually deflected wide by junior Heilert. Fiery deflection and it is a corner to Canada but Buchanan's done well you're right actually Dion it was David wasn't it? Good chance by the way Jonathan David there just getting across then Donk at the near post just trying to anticipate getting to that ball first doesn't quite connect they get there at the same time that's a good chance a really good chance they're not sitting back they're not waiting for Belgium at all. So it's a corner from the right hand side junior Heilert to take this raises both arms steps away three four five strides first big set-piece chance for Canada nil-nil on five life Heilert waits and now here is the delivery with a corner it's a deep one towards the penalty spot it's taken down and shot Corbett's and deflected but took the pace off it the shot that was was hit well by Buchanan who's already caught the eye but it took the pace off it and Courtois in the Belgian goal just had to make a couple of steps to his left to catch the ball. Yeah it was it was it was more or less on the penalty spot two yards from the penalty spot and he just turns takes a touch smacks it through about three players it took about two deflections Courtois gone left he's gone right and just by chance the ball went to him. Well hang on the referee has stopped play and said that the AR is checking for a possible penalty a potential handball now I'm not sure about in fact the referee the referee is very quickly drawn the rectangle in the air and has been called across to have a look at the screen so I'm guessing we've not seen the pictures yet I'm guessing that that is Buchanan's shot that must have struck the arm possibly an outstretched arm maybe an arm above the head of a Belgian defender and we're seeing it now and Carrasco's arm is is out in front of his body and it comes off his wrist. It is it is and you know what it's actually it's a good strike it's going goalbound as well yeah and it has hit his left left wrist it's going into the right hand side of Courtois goal it hits his hand it is going goal would I think they're quite I think they're quite strong I think Juan Soto of Venezuela is quite clear he believes it's a penalty and yes there we are there is the decision Canada have been awarded an early penalty the video assistant referee has stepped in I think Carrasco is going to be shown a yellow card as well for that I'm not sure we knew a great deal about it in all honesty but he is yellow carded for it and it was goalbound and I think Jonathan David has already got the ball on the spot he's not going to waste any time here at all so Canada what an opportunity this is in the 10th minute in fact the Canada it's Alfonso Davis who has got the ball and he's put it on the spot what a moment this is here in Doha in 2022 Canada have a golden opportunity here to score their first goal at a World Cup but Alfonso Davis of Bayern Munich has to beat Tebow Courtois of Real Madrid this is a heavyweight penalty contest Alfonso Davis with his left foot has his eyes on the ball total concentration the stadium almost quiet as it waits for this huge moment a chance for Canada to take the lead against Belgium still he waits and now up he steps left footed and it's saved by Courtois and it comes back to Davis and he was impeded there was a teammate going for the same ball and he's hooked the follow-up high and wide and the chance has gone for Canada the chance has gone for Alfonso Davis and Tebow Courtois man of a match in the Champions League final remember saves from the penalties saves from the penalty spot down to his right pushing it away and it's a goal kick to Belgium the off-penalty it's a really poor penalty I mean I've taken a few penalties as well not at this level but when you put the ball down so early and you're waiting in your stud you can have so many thoughts going in your head I'd like to have the ball in my hand I'd like to wait till the last minute and prepare properly really poor penalty we know how good Tebow Courtois is at penalty saves and it's a really really bad one it's not even in the corner it'll be really disappointed with that no Venom no direction nothing at all such a disappointment for Canada can you imagine them all over that great that huge country televisions radios tablets you name it devices that would have been for them what a start all tuned into the stadium here the Ahmed bin Ali stadium and such disappointment here's Jonathan David though Canada bright coming forward Buchanan is challenged and then advances to Whitzel on the edge of the box and Belgium have got it back what a disappointment for Canada what a let-off for Belgium yeah it is a let-off actually Belgium was you know that they're actually just looking down to each of the now Vitzel's looking now looking at Tealemans and as if to say well let's just get the ball down let's just play for a bit get hold of the ball let's not force things and and Canada on the front foot they've had most of the ball as well in Belgium's final third yeah look really sharp coming forward and here they are on the right-hand side with Buchanan again who's seen a lot of the ball in the early stages and he wins a throw in off Carrasco so this is Tejon Buchanan who plays for Club Bruges who are one of the teams of the season with what they've been able to do in the Champions League and they've taken the throw quickly and the shot is dragged wide from over on the on the right-hand side larry it is who just snatched it rather the Nottingham Forest man as he is is on loan as I say in Canada and it is a goal kick to Belgium they'll get they seem to be getting in in those sort of pockets in front of the back three of Belgium very easy turning and then picking a few one twos between each other yes they are and here's Hutchinson now the shaven-headed Hutchinson 39 years old to highlight on the left deep cross to the back post Buchanan nods it across it's come out David pulls it under his left foot shoots but that's blocked and Belgium should get it away but it's been given away and now David with another chance there might be another penalty in there you know although the offside flag is up and and the Canadian players I think are going to the referee and saying how about that for another penalty but I think the flag had already gone up before the challenge came in on Jonathan David yes it had and it would have been it would for Tongan took the legs of Jonathan David but he'd already received the ball in an offside position. We're looking at the replays here on our screens that would have definitely been a penalty if the offside flag hadn't been raised there was a a moment there when oh I think it was Jonathan David swung with his left foot he was about 12 yards out it was going goal woods when he struck it but if it had just laid it to his left Hutchinson was there on the penalty spot three strike at goal there the decisions you have to make the correct decisions if you're going to give yourself a chance to score a goal against a team like these. Belgium Nailed Canada Nailed that's Dion Dublin with us of course of course it's Dion Dublin and this match is also available tonight by the way on World Cup Extra on your BBC iplayer i.e. if you'd like to listen to this match with the five live commentary but also have it synced in with the pictures it's very clever is but we can do it for any match that is live from this World Cup on BBC television and this one is Steve Wilson and Jermaine Genus are just about what 15 yards over to our left in their commentary position so they're doing the commentary on the TV but if you like for a bit of variety to to have the radio commentary with your TV pictures just like your grandfather used to do then you can do it in 2022 on the iplayer World Cup Extra and there are various other things on there as well I think extra extra entertainment. Belgium Nailed Canada Nailed and Belgium half-creeked that was quite a creaky piece of defending actually by Fertongan who is now 35 years old there's some there's some elderly elderly some older gentlemen out there on the pitch this evening aren't there Fertongan at 35 and Vohjan the goalkeeper 35 but no one's older than Atiba Hutchinson 39 years old who sets a record tonight as the second oldest outfield player at a World Cup the only outfield player older than Atiba Hutchinson is the famous Roger Miller who played in the World Cup for Cameroon at 42 as the ball is played forward for junior Hoylert who chested across the penalty area David is in the middle Hoylert is bright shoots across goal but wider the far post from the far side of the penalty area a low shot skidded across the turf and beyond the far post you know it's a really good ball you know a really really good it's just fed into that left hand channel down Belgium's left down Canada's right it's fed from there in towards junior Hoylert he gets in between Fertongan who was I don't know who it was at the back there at the time but he gets in between Fertongan and out of their old and it's so easy one ball just cuts out three defenders they're just not switched on at the moment Belgium they're not Belgium Nail Canada Nail and we heard from our friend Christoph Terreur part of the five live Euroleague show before the before the match he was telling me he says the problem is Belgium haven't played well for a year together it's real concerns over this brilliant record for such a long time under Roberto Martinez world rank number one for such a long time but they lost that position to Brazil earlier this year but now here they are coming forward but we've seen nothing of them in an attacking sense and I don't think I've said Kevin De Bruyne's name yet since the start of the match no I don't think he's had many touches he's trying to get on the ball but he's kind of being man marked in the middle of the park one in front one behind every every time he a Belgian player looks up to try and find him he'll find he'll find his feet he'll find the pace in the game he usually does Azard is fouled center field Alistair Johnston put in the challenge booze from the Canadian supporters but it's a pre-kicked to Belgium five or six yards inside the Canadian half and they're in they're in Canadians half I don't know how many times they've been in this half not many we've seen all the action in Belgium's final furs because Canada have been so good in this opening a few minutes so a free kick to Belgium yes they lost to Egypt in Q8 in their final warm-up match last week as we were hearing earlier so that means they've now lost six of their last 17 internationals Belgium most unlike them having lost only four of the first 60 under Roberto Martinez's management ball in from the right-hand side from Telemans of course this team is absolutely littered with players who either play or have played in the Premier League eight of this starting lineup that applies to and we have six of this Belgium team that are playing at their fifth tournament either World Cup or European Championships a great great experience as the ball goes back to Courtois Tibaut Courtois he's got 98 caps now should make it to 100 all being well at the tournament and now here is Kevin de Bruyne for the first time receiving the ball in the centre circle and carrying it forward but over hitting the pass through for Carasco and goalkeeper Boyan can take three or four big steps forward and just picks the ball up as if it was a back pass from Kevin de Bruyne yeah he was striding past the age in Hutchinson he left him for dead for pace he was going straight towards the middle of the D and he picked the wrong pass Telemans was flying down his right shoulder he just didn't lift his head Kevin de Bruyne I can't believe I'm saying it but he made the wrong choice Belgium nil Canada nil five live and BBC sounds for this fourth match of the day first time I've covered one of what is here in Qatar one of the 10 o'clock kickoffs so it's going to be a late finish tonight by the time we get back onto the road into Doha and visit the petrol station as well which we have to do on the way back Yes we do yes I know the way out the stadium I've been here before don't worry about it The ball on the right hand side with Belgium inside their own half Castania have left the city of course up towards Batuay and then Whitzel chests the ball down and gives it on the halfway line to the captain Aidan Azad who crouches low and chests it down and then sets off on one of his weaving runs and is upended by Buchanan so it's a free kick again to Belgium near the centre circle Yeah I think when you watch Aidan Hazad play if you ever watch him play and he plays the ball forward and follows that ball forward in any of the thirds of it you can always sense that something's going to happen when he plays and stays then you know he's just controlling the game when he plays and goes forward he's making something happen there and then yeah one of the best players at the World Cup four years ago got the silver ball as the runner-up in the player of the tournament competition to Luka Modric this tonight for Azad his 124th appearance for Belgium and of course the issue with him has been his fitness at Real Madrid just played six times for Real Madrid this season so far but fit to captain and start at the first match of the World Cup for Belgium tonight where it is nil nil but Canada have been the better team at least in an attacking sense they've really caused problems for Belgium and the main news so far the fact that they had a chance to score their first goal at a World Cup but Alfonso Davis's penalty poor penalty Dion was saved by Couretois yeah it wasn't it wasn't a great save but it's the same he expects to make himself and it's just all the energy that they have and they're using it well at the moment they are the press is good whenever the the full backs get it and Belgium the press is there in three and four players they're not going on their own no space for Belgium to play through the lines at all they're looking frustrated at the moment Belgium nil nil 20 minutes played already so penalty save second night running I've seen a penalty saved after a chore kept out Robert Lewandowski last night tonight Couretois makes the save one of the very best goalkeepers as you will no doubt be aware Telemans is now tripped in the central third Roberto Martin has steps forward to right to the white line on the edge of the pitch and feeling that the referee I think the point is is that there've been a number of little fouls on Belgian players in the central third of the field and that's the latest of them Whitzel plays the ball back to the middleman of the three central defenders Toby Aldervireld who turns and gives it out to the left hand side and then it's back to Fautonghen now who is back with Anderlecht now Toby Aldervireld to his right now playing for Royal Antwerp back in his home country and then from the back Kamal Miller for Canada over hits that pass he was looking for Buchanan so Belgium now move forward with it again Carrasco with the bleached hair is being impeded he's being tugged by Laria so it's a free kick to Belgium inside their own half but quite well organised Canada looks like everyone knows the job that they're supposed to do and Belgium begin to come forward again here's Leander Dendonka of Aston Villa turns and gives it back to Toby Aldervireld and then a long long right footed pass from Aldervireld looking for it and Azad who takes that down brilliantly and gets away from Johnston and Azad back to the edge of the area to Telemans and Telemans across the bat away right side of the area. Puts the shot over the top of the crossbar he was slipping he was stretching for it Kamal Miller the central defender slid in as well and he actually deflected it up and over the top for what is a corner. Yeah Telemans actually lays it into Batshuay Telemans is on the edge of the on the edge of the box he lays it to his right Batshuay is there and Batshuay takes a touch doesn't need to take a touch it's a side foot it's on the angle about two yards away from the corner of the six yard box if he just if he backs himself with a nice strong ankle I think he's got a chance of scoring there he takes a touch and the defender nips him. Well defended by Miller Kamal Miller so it's a corner Belgium's first corner still 0-0 De Bruyne had to take this from way down in front of us out swinger towards the penalty spot but that is headed away by Steven Vittoria and now Canada looked to break through Davis but there was an important tackle in the middle of air in the middle of that and then a long pass forward that Kuatua is going to deal with out he clears it but he gives it away but Whitzel was able to to head forward the deflection in center field and junior Hoylert is able to in fact under pressure he puts it out of play for a throw on the halfway line John Herdman down there just fields the ball and gives it back for the throw to be taken. John Herdman tonight another sort of historical line John Herdman tonight becomes the first person to manage at both the men's and the women's world cup what an achievement that is he will always be able to say that this man from County Durham mad king fan of Newcastle United and now then Doncat passing it away from the back Tealamans that's a lovely pass and Bobrna has the run of the pitch he's got so much space and now he gives it to the edge of the area to Azad and Azad under pressure into the penalty area he's forced very wide it was Laria coming back and putting the challenge in on him it was quite forceful on the edge of the area but Azad stayed on his feet yeah he did Laria did really well there and Johnston shepherded hazard didn't allow him to get his head up to cross the ball or do any little bits of skill and they forced him back towards his teammate took a deflection and that was the the best thing that could have happened Belgium Nill Canada Nill I don't think there's quite as big an attendance inside the stadium tonight as there was for the Wales match when you were here the other night as Belgium win a free kick in center field quite a lot of empty red seats around the place and I noticed as well just been shown that um the FIFA have put out an updated an updated stadium capacity list so goodness knows how that how that's happened long pass from center field but Castaña making a burst into the box there was a defender in front of him and it hit him the long pass from center field from Aldervireld and bounced through for a goal kick so this stadium Ahmad bin Ali which was originally slated as being 40 000 capacity is now 45 000 and 32 and and all of the stadiums have got different attendances well have a closer look at that later is that on the BBC sport website is it no FIFA have put it out so you'll find it there fascinating Belgium Nill Canada Nill and Alfonso Davis on the left hand side an elaborate step over but it's taken him up towards the edge of the area and he gets the ball back and Davis plays it square but then the uh a rather slashing shot from the veteran Hutchinson the captain on the edge of the area that lack conviction and it was wide by three or four yards yeah you can see Davis there he's receiving it on the right on the left hand side he wants to stay on his left foot but the Belgian players aren't allowing him to do that so shifted it to his uh to his older teammate and he slashed it over but brilliant skill though to get past to to the Belgian players I think uh you know they've already missed the great opportunity tonight from the penalties bot to score their first World Cup goal but were it to be a Tiber Hutchinson to score it winning his 97th cap tonight you know this this wildly and hugely popular footballer wherever he's gone in the world if he'd scored that from the edge of the D for Canada's first goal at a World Cup I mean that would be fairytale stuff however maybe maybe thought about the moment as he was arriving on the ball and he hit it wildly wide and now Witzholz been fouled that is another foul by the uh the midfielder Ustacul of Porto and again Roberto Martinez is pointing to various points on the field as if to say how many how many fouls are going to be allowed on my players before there's a yellow card happy is he no it's not uh good physical contact though they don't mind that these Canadian players are really getting close to the Belgian midfield players not allowing Witzholz and De Bruyne to lift their heads not having their own way at the moment the other point about Hutchinson Dion is he's been able to play only one match this season because he had a bruised bone so he's just played one competitive match this season so you know you can understand him perhaps not looking absolutely tip top as Canada win the ball back deep inside their own half and it is Ustacul who is challenged by Witzholz and now Davis Davis being forced back by Keylemens and doesn't like the challenge actually looks over his shoulder at Keylemens for for the force of the challenge that he put in on him but back through the goalkeeper Boyan the ball is played out towards the right hand side now in the middle of the field Jonathan David's come rather deep Harry Kane style but passes the ball down the right hand side to Lariat and Buchanan's in the middle and Lariat takes it on into the box and pulls it back but Castania came across from the right wing back position and was there to prevent it from reaching junior Hoylert in the middle and Belgium Cleart still goalless five live in BBC sounds live here at the World Cup in Qatar and Canada coming forward again and Witzholz just putting the tackle in but the ball still live Lariat tries to play it across the penalty area that's blocked by the defender for Tongan and Belgium get it away down there panic panic from those five at the back they're going into a five at the back when they haven't got the ball now Belgium they're they're worried about the movement they're worried about going down the side with pace they're worried about Hoylert coming in from the left hand side and getting across the center halves the Tongan out of their own the gaps between them are massive so they're loving that as well the Canadian players and now he has Johnston bringing the ball forward from the right back position for Canada and he's still going to the edge of the area oh and he's surely fouled he's surely brought down on the edge of the penalty area no the referee arms play to continue then Johnston gets up and shoots and it's saved by Courtois Johnston again heads it across the penalty area and Belgium are able to get it away but that looked to me as though Dendonka caught him in the box I thought he took his legs just on the edge of the box well it looked like that to me referee didn't even didn't even look at it and the players haven't haven't made a great deal of it so well watch that again out of interest with interest when it when it appears play still continuing the staccio plays it up towards the the lively figure of Buchanan and Buchanan is running at Alderv-Ireld and now he's trying to find a way into the penalty area past Castania but just overheated and for Tongan was able to come across and put it out of play on the half course and Havoc absolutely causing havoc at the moment yes they are just through just through energy and and getting in behind the ball and not allowing Belgium any time I mean Buchanan up top and David and Hoylert they're just there's three up there and they're just sort of rotating it's working well at the moment for them looking really well and uh I know a little television here in the commentary position they've shown us a replay of the Johnston shot but they've not shown a replay of the Dendonka challenge on Johnston so it's gone and uh the staccio playing the ball forward and Canada coming forward again dangerously Buchanan back to David David shot is blocked by the defender Alderv-Ireld threw himself in the way of it and took all the pace of it off it and Kutwa was able to catch decision making in the final third for Canada that's all it is they're just I think what's happening they're getting into gold scoring situations but there's a better gold scoring situation and they can't see it there's other players that are flying down the left flying down the right and they're just choosing the wrong option they've had three or four good chances to test Kutwa and they haven't done it you can't keep letting these chances pass you by the score is Belgium 0 Canada 0 and Dion Dublin I think we've seen enough football we know what's going to happen here don't we looking that way they are going to pay dearly for not taking those chances and here's Batuay on the edge of the area but Miller is able to win it from him for Canada and now Hutchinson chips it to the left hand side and Davis now slipped by Tealamon so Davis is away he's left him on the ground Davis and plays it in field Hoylert is battling through it with Azard and they went shoulder to shoulder and Hoylert has come out with it and Hoylert now chips across to the back post and did it off balance can only head it up in the air and wide of the far post but again really really good from Canada yet not just not just the nice football the play not just the chances but the commitment and the mindset and their shape is very very good every time the physical battles there the two number tens Hoylert and Hazard going shoulder to shoulder knocking Hazard over once in the Bournemore here's Debrona though receives it from Batuay Debrona now on the left wing currently goes for a high crossfield pass Batuay is underneath this should go it's been it's deflected off Miller and the goalkeeper caught it the assistant has flagged three flags for goal kick anyway Batuay is being helped to his feet and it is indeed given as a goal kick yes it's it's exactly what you were saying John it's we know what's going to happen here and Kevin Debrona gets free a bit of time to pick a pass he picks the collect pass Batuay pulling away from the defender doesn't quite catch it but doesn't matter how good you're playing doesn't matter how well organized you are if you don't use this time to score a goal you are very very vulnerable yeah mark my words everyone I'm gonna put my neck on the line go on then after last night boldly predicting early on in the game that Robert Levendowski would score his first goal at the World Cup and sitting there with the microphone having that go for you licking my lips as he stood over that penalty thinking here we are I'm going to be proved right you weren't feeling smug where you are of course but I'm gonna I'm not gonna learn from my mistake you're gonna get on you're gonna get on you're gonna get on I'm gonna say tonight Belgium are going to make Canada pay for these missed chances yeah I can't I can't disagree with that I'm afraid however yes we might be wrong so don't go anywhere everyone Belgium nil Canada nil this match also on BBC one so you might want to go and watch it but I have to say you can listen to us and watch it here's Castania down the right hand side you won't reach that and pulls it back but the ball was already over the line and it is a goal kick so Belgium will drop back into position but it's been an unconvincing display from from Belgium so far I mean and and also the other point is when Belgium come forward Canada are leaving them so much space yeah they are it's because Belgium they haven't had the bubble when they do beat that press when they do beat the energy then you do have the brouhna running at your defence and bits and hazard with the ball and then they're starting to spin back towards their own goal it's lush defense it's they've gone away with it at the moment like I've said while you have your team in the ascendancy you have to get yourself on the score sheet Belgium nil Canada nil every few moments the attention is drawn to the lights that flash on the top of the stadium there's like a big metal frame around the roof of the stadium here and you can see it from miles around and the stadiums lit up colourfully as well for a night match but those lights flash on and off all of the time feels like driving out here almost on the fringes of the city of Doha and it's just the the desert beyond Belgium lose possession Canada have it back inside their own half uh Christophe Theroux was also telling me that that Belgium are based on the other coast of Qatar so we're here on the east coast they're over on the west coast so they're actually about an hour and a half's drive away from Doha right across the middle of the country rather than staying here in the uh in the big city here's Davis he says it's very nice over there as well Davis playing the ball to the right hand side to Johnston and Johnston now is able to bring it forward and goes for an early ball into the middle but that's headed away by Alderweirald and Belgium should be able to clear they do up to Azad but Azad runs into Hutchinson and Hutchinson passes it forward to the right hand side to to larry at and then it bounces away off Whitzel out towards the far side where it is kept in by Carrasco and then Carrasco back to Whitzel and Belgium have got it halfway inside their own half we've got less than 10 minutes to go it's a half time I think that's right yes it is my stopwatch was misbehaving last night I was blaming on the desert heat although it's very pleasant in here tonight isn't it it's his cast nice temperature isn't it lovely temperature helped by the air conditioning no doubt I'm not thinking that I'm sure the vest isn't working for you tonight I don't know I'm afraid yes it's I think you I think you're mixing me we look up with Ian Dennis a lot a lot of people do you know the ball is up towards the halfway line which is flicked on and then the Vittoria passes it to Ostacchio been really bright really encouraging this this display this first world cup display for Canada since 1986 when they lost all three of their matches one nil to France two nil to Hungary two nil to the Soviet Union so lost all three without scoring a goal ball on the right hand side and it is the Canadians trying to conjure up that first goal lariat back to Ostacchio and Ostacchio just uses the outside of his right boot to give it to Johnston then back to Ostacchio again and then Hutchinson closer to the penalty area back to Johnston on the right hand side Hutchinson again lariat there's a defender fallen over Telemans lariat takes it on into the box which will puts the challenge in and the ball bounces through for what is a goal kick the Zambian referee was there less than 10 yards away from it and this time the players do feel that they've got a case for another penalty Hutchinson has gone to the referee the supporters the Canadian fans do feel that the result there was enough from Witzel on that you know you know what that's clumsy that is very very clumsy I'm really surprised they haven't looked at that at all we've got screens where they normally let us know what's going to be happening are they looking are they not but that it's listen it's not looking they are looking they are looking we've just seen it come up on our screen I think that will be given as a penalty because it's just clumsy defending from Witzel I don't think I don't think it should be you don't no no I don't think it should be but it's clumsy and they are given and there's a team are given huge cheer from the Canadian supporters because on the screens now in the stadium hanging high above the goals at each end of the ground it's saying check possible penalty and so we are not seeing a restart just yet at Iba Hutchinson has gone across to the referee again also Stephen Victoria it's a long long look at this the decision whether whether Axel Witzel has pushed over Laria and they say no personally I feel that's the right decision I don't I don't think there was enough it was a tangle of legs he didn't he didn't mean to tackle him he didn't mean to bring him down but he brought him down in the box through a tangle of legs sloppy defending they've already had one penalty Canada and Coutouas saved it from Davis just over five minutes to go to half time Belgium 0 Canada 0 later at halftime Kelly Kate will have more on the earlier matches Spain's big wins 7-0 against Costa Rica that is the same group in which Germany were beaten by Japan as Davis turns and gives the ball for Drostakio and Davis wants it back continuing his run his pass into the penalty area is into the path of Alder Irold who comes across to his right and gets his right foot underneath it and clears it out almost on top of Roberto Martínez he looks good doesn't he? Davis looks very very good on that left hand side I mean he was facing his own goal in the left back the left back spot facing his own goal in front of the dugout and a full pirouette towards the touch now and just played a lovely one too very very sharp yep Davis the 22 year old who was a little bit of a doubt for this game but he's okay obviously desperate to play in this match such an important player brilliant story which is always worth repeating born in Ghana Liberian parents and was actually born in a Ghanaian refugee camp because it was during the civil war in Liberia you can only imagine what he's gone through as as a human being and now to reach the level in the game that he has champions league winner playing in the World Cup Canada's first match for 36 years it's a great story and Belgium coming forward Azard shrugs off this challenge from a stack you're still going gives it to Castania on the right hand side and he gives it to his Leicester City teammate Telemans now back towards the the halfway line to Dendonca who goes across the back line to Fertongan and then Whitzel back to Alder Irold in the middle Alder Irold and Fertongan still going I was talking to Vincent company earlier this evening about how he felt about that at 30 36 he is and he feels like long retired now which you had to of course because you know that the all the years and the injuries kept caught up on him but he's sitting watching this for BBC television and they're still going for Tongan and Alder Irold ball into the back line again and Fertongan gives it across to Alder Irold they've been tested tonight by Canada though a long pass from Alder Irold he's over hit this one but it was actually the long pass that that led to Belgium's best chance of the match so yeah absolutely but they've been they've been forced to play the long pass you know they haven't wanted to do it they've been forced because it's very congested they've tried to play their football it hasn't worked so they tried to go long it hasn't worked as the ball is played back to the Canadian goalkeeper rugged looking Milan Bojan who gets it away on his left foot and Belgium have got it back inside their own half again mentioned about how people in Canada will have been feeling watching that penalty hearts and mouths and the disappointment when it was say poor penalty from Alfonso Davis but at the same time can you imagine the reaction there is in Belgium and they have been quite critical of the way that the Belgian national team have played you know the nearly men really yeah they are not being able to win a major tournament I mean if you let them back into this game now if you're allowed to have time in the ball and pick a pass they will find a way through one or two one or two times in this game yeah always always quarter finals in the last two euros as Canada win the ball back in Santa field but it's sent forward and then Donca will return it to Tibo Couretois so in the last four either will cup a European championship tournaments they've gone quarter final quarter final semifinal quarter final not able to really capitalise on the great talent that they've had they've had and still have it is de Bruyne winning his 95th cap tonight four of the six men who've won 100 caps or more for Belgium are on the field in this match tonight four out of the six Centurions forward from Alderweil that's that long pass again looking for Carasco it's bounce from Batuay brilliant finish left foot bang one nil Belgium and Michy Batuay is dancing in the corner of the stadium here Belgium have made Canada pay they didn't take their chances and Batuay has Belgium won Canada nil just before halftime one of the simplest finishes he will ever come across Michy Batuay he puts it in the back of an in between two defenders Johnston Victoria switched off he gets in between them half volley straight ball straight passes about 10 yards out little side foot pass the keeper meet and drink but that's why easy easy I did say if you don't take your chances you are in trouble came from that Alderviral pass yeah not the not the first time that that's caused problems for the Belgian backline for the Canadian backline clearly something that Roberto Martinez has identified and it's worked yeah and it was and at the time that ball was being played Kevin de Bruyne was talking to the manager he was chatting to his manager getting instruction Kevin de Bruyne wasn't in the island any of the Canadian players they must be thinking where is he back to why he's straight in straight ball very very good finish composed finish so no look at who he's on the uh on the injured list but Batuay's come in and Batman as he likes to style himself has scored his 27th goal for Belgium and they are in front Roberto Martinez his side Koutar saved the penalty early on in the match Batuay scores near half time five minutes of added time at the end of this first half that is like by the standards of this World Cup so another five minutes before the halftime whistle will be blown Batuay and the Belgium supporters inside the stadium will be feeling much better about themselves the television here has just shown a close-up of the those famous big goggily eyes of Pierre Luigi Collina who's in charge of the referees at FIFA and Belgium now looking for a second goal before halftime de Bruyne at the Azar who hits a pass through the middle along the grass but Boyan's able to come out and pick it up it's a really good finish by Batuay it wasn't up for the goal just allowed the ball to drop over his shoulder the defender was there yeah with him Miller came across but just as it bounced up he hit it and steered it with his left foot beyond and across the goalkeeper and into the net there's Canada come forward with Davis Davis then passes her into the area now a chance for David who pulls the ball across the six yard box but into the path of Fatongan who was able to clear it away and again story of the night for the miss me that nice story of the night for them getting into really good areas and then just choosing the wrong pass or the execution of that pass isn't there they're still getting white shirts into the box but there's just a feeling now that the more Belgium have the ball the more they'll take control the more they'll score 1-0 so Canada are still in it but you know Dion you'll have been in this position many many times as a professional when you've been involved in this sort of match and you get back into the dressing room and you're 1-0 down but here's Larry at Larry Arocos our chance in the middle for Buchanan on the left foot sliding in edge of the six yard box and he's lifted it over the top of the bar another big chance gone for Canada I think that's Larry who just puts it across it's a really good ball by the way it's two yards away from the six yard box he's put it over the bar I don't know how he's put it over the bar Buchanan will look back at this one and I'll say that's just a tapping it's what he's tried to do the balls come in with pace and then you just let it hit your foot he's tried to strike the ball he's striked it too hard and it's gone over the bar chance after chance they've had they've had the best chances tonight they've had 1-0 Belgium lead in this group where Morocco and Croatia drew 0-0 earlier and Belgium's next game is against Morocco the next matches in this group are in are on Sunday Canada still coming forward five minutes of added time we've had almost three of them so there's still time Davis is off and away from Gulsko Rabatua'i and then Davis rather runs into then Doncads no free kick for that De Bruyne I couldn't find the pass through to Azadi actually passed it straight into Vittoria so it is Canada again who have it dated to the right hand side Larry is there again Carrasco puts in the challenge that ball's going to run behind for a corner it is next to the flag over on the far side so it is a late corner in the first half for Canada yeah I think the way forward for Camerij is getting Davis further forward getting in the final third down that left hand side letting create Habak he wants to take players on but if he gets him wrong in that left back spot then he's in trouble get him up the pitch a bit more Davis is going to take the corner trots over there and receives the ball from in front of the ever-changing electronic sponsors hoardings and then steps away and Canada from the set piece just before halftime in comes the delivery over the top of Carrasco and then Estaccio with a shot on the edge of the area hits a defender and is cleared away I don't think they're shouting for a handball this time finds its way back to Davis on the right hand side Davis against Carrasco Davis beats him one way Carrasco though as he tried to beat him again managed to get the foot in took the ball away and actually Aidan Azad now carries it up towards the halfway line and then passes it over the line to De Bruyne and De Bruyne now in that way of his plays the ball across the the area behind Azad Canada get it away De Bruyne though is in there again and then Alistair Johnston is underneath it and volleys it to the halfway line it's got a very old-fashioned sound hasn't it for some reason Alistair Johnston the Canadian right back I don't think there are any other Alistair's playing at this World Cup if anybody knows it'll be you I think that one could that could be one for Dave O'Brien, Statman Dave couldn't it who's on the football daily the World Cup daily as it is every day how many Alistair's have played at World Cups and no one who's commentated on a World Cup oh yes and there is the halftime whistle well that's been eventful Belgium are winning 1-0 at halftime Batchewaey scoring in the 44th minute Canada should have scored their first World Cup goal and Alfonso Dave's I'm looking at him now walking off the field staring at the ground I can feel his disappointment from here and the responsibility remember he's a young man 22 years old he took the responsibility and hit a poor penalty that Couretois saved but all of the other chances Canada have had they've come they've gone and Belgium are winning beyond Dublin Belgium to take charge of this game they haven't they haven't needed to to be fair because Canada have been wasteful in front of goal and that's the only negative I have on them to be honest with you they've been absolutely outstanding for 35 minutes in the first half very positive lots of energy final third need to do better Belgium just waited and waited and waited quality past quality finish but it is still alive it's not over yet halftime Belgium won Canada no it's been really entertaining though John and Dion that there've been some real moments for Canada they're way ahead in terms of shots on goal not necessarily shots on target but they've had 13 shots compared to Belgium's four and it just feels like that finesse that experience of being at major tournaments is just missing in that Belgium side in the Belgium side or the Canadian side sorry Canada side sorry Dion yeah yeah yeah no but no but you're right in everything you say there Kelly because they've done everything right they really have they've won the ball back with pace they've closed down the Belgium midfield players that can change a game with pace they haven't had a chance to do anything they've wanted to do for 35 minutes so they've done everything with pace and unfortunately they've tried to finish when they get into those positions with pace and there's no calm there's no ice cool number nine that's going to put the ball in the back of the net or haven't seen it as yet that's what they have to do get the ball back with pace and then calm down they haven't had that calm down moment yes Kelly you've for me she backed Schwaid to get the goal that's put Belgium up at halftime I mean John many people would have been questioning his inclusion in this starting 11 maybe so you know Lukaku is injured as I say he's got this this hamstring problem but but Batuayi has been quite a Roberto Martinez man hasn't he in the time that Roberto Martinez has been in charge and as I say you know he is in decent goal scoring form he's got he's got eight of them for for Fenerbahce this season which is where he's playing now scored a hat trick late last month just before the World Cup so you know it's a it's a judgment call he's a confident lad we know that because we've seen him so much over the years and he certainly took his goal well. Dion just looking at at Canada and from their perspective look they might not go on to win this game Belgium already have the advantage and they also have the experience playing in the second half but from what we've seen of Canada over these 45 minutes they could really be a lot of fun at this tournament yes they seem to be enjoying it as well you know in the first half an hour they really enjoyed their football they played some really good stuff they look confident on the ball David's down the left hand side looks very very good getting further up the pitch I think they could be more chances made or created for Camender but you've got to stay switched on you can't just go press press press press and leave the defenders free on free Kevin de Bruyne as we call it Pat will tell you the same thing Kevin de Bruyne has cheated slightly what I mean by that he hasn't gone back to defend he's found that little pocket and when they win it back he's the man that gets the ball he's the man that dictates the pace of Belgium's attacks and you know he's going to start taking charge of this game again Pat Nevin who's here with me in the studio in Doha but we'll get his thoughts in just a few minutes time we'll also be joined by Julian LeRon to discuss that first half and look ahead to the game for Wales as well we'll be back with Dion and with John inside the stadium for the second half of Belgium against Canada very shortly it's coming up after the BBC News with Richard Foster take the world cup with you Qatar 2022 on BBC sounds this is BBC Radio 5 Live protests are taking place across Scotland after a court ruling that they can't be a second independence referendum without Westminster's approval Nicola Sturgeon wanted to vote next October but the Supreme Court ruled she doesn't have the power the Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Jack has been speaking in the comment at this type of unprecedented challenges the benefits of being part of the United Kingdom have never been more apparent never been more apparent Mr Speaker the United Kingdom government is providing the Scottish Government with a record block grant settlement of 41 billion pounds per year over the next three years the Home Secretary has admitted there have been failures in the way the UK's controlled its borders Soella Braverman was questioned by MPs over problems at the migrant processing centre in Manstown in Kent she blamed people smugglers and those that they brought across the channel illegally President Biden's condemned what he calls another senseless act of violence after a mass shooting in Virginia a Walmart store employee murdered six people before shooting himself the supermarket chain says the member of staff had worked with them since 2010 the Prime Minister has appointed a top lawyer called Adam Tolley to lead an investigation into bullying complaints against the Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab he's denied any wrongdoing Adam Tolley specializes in commercial and employment law a disabled British man's been chosen for astronaut training by Europe's space agency John McFool who's 41 had his right leg amputated after a motorbike crash when he was 19 he went on to represent Team GB at the Paralympics the YouTuber Tom Harris who uses a wheelchair says it'll do lots for disability awareness as someone who's really passionate about the idea of disabled people entering more industries all across you know the world and in every different sector the idea of you know a disabled astronaut or a parastro is just such a huge accomplishment and a huge step forward for every disabled person and Waitrose has changed part of its Christmas advert after a backlash from a skin cancer patient the original one featured two farmers comparing their suntans F1 to have these kind of season I don't think it will come along very often but I'm definitely enjoying the moment listen on BBC sounds BBC 5 Live the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 with Kelly Kate day four of the 2022 World Cup here in Qatar and the shocks keep on coming into the penalty area masala here okay thanks Spain are in 7th heaven. Marata, can the number 7 get the 7th? Yes, he can! 7th heaven for Spain and for Marata, and that is the cherry on top of the cake that they wanted. Alvaro Marata gets his goal, and what a confidence start this is to this World Cup from Spain. Belgium lead Canada by a goal to nail at half-time, although Canada have had plenty of opportunities, including a saved penalty, and it was a goalless draw earlier between Croatia and Morocco, also in Group F, and after that goalless draw, Belgium on track to take control. Forward from Alvaro, that's that long pass again, looking for Keras Gordzpens from Batuay! Brilliant finish! Left foot, bang! One nail, Belgium, and Michi Batuay is dancing in the corner of the stadium here. It's been quite a day already. Pat Nevin is alongside me, Julien Laurent joins us from the Akmaid-Binali stadium, having watched the first 45 minutes of Belgium's game against Canada, which they lead by a goal to nail. Earlier Germany suffered a drop to beat by Japan. Japan came from a goal down to beat the 4-time winners by 2 goals to 1. We will reflect on that very shortly. Just a quick word on that first half, Julien. I thought I loved this Canada team. I have to say, I had high expectations because they've been fantastic in the way they qualified. John Herdman, the English coach, I think he's doing a great job after doing a great job with the women's side, and even with the youth teams. Now with this team, the players that they have, I mean, Ustakio Porto-Mitfield, he's a superb player, he's only 25, and I'm sure soon he'll be in a much bigger club. Atiba Hershinson is 39 years old, he's the oldest player in this tournament, he's the only man in his squad who was born the last time Canada in 1986, when they were in the World Cup, and he's still bossing that Mitfield, he's bossing Witzel, he's bossing Tilleman's, and them too. I've run the game, but football can be cruel sometimes, and like the boys were saying, just one mistake on that long ball, that was not even for Batra, it was clearly aimed for Carrasco, and the penalty missed, and the chances that they had, there's a second half to play, but you wonder if that goal psychologically, I think, could be a bit of a blow for Canada. More to come from Chile and Laurent, and from Pat, more now though on Germany's Shock to Feet by Japan. Here's Ilke Gundurren at full time. We have no other choice, to be honest, than try to be confident, you know, and play on the best possible level, because unfortunately, because of the result today, that's already our first final, so every game now is going to be a final, I think it could have been better if we would have won today, obviously. The pressure wouldn't be that high, but now with that result today, we have to win. I think in general, with the performance, we know there's maybe still a lack of certain things, but when you look just on paper, I think we were quite dominant, and at the end of the day, we had the chances, you know, we had the chances to score earlier, the second one, even a third one, to be honest, where the keeper was also doing well, we hit the post, I think the crossbar once, and I hit the post, so, yeah, I don't think we really played that bad, to be honest. Pat Ilke Gundurren makes an excellent point, which is that Germany dominated the game, they had plenty of chances, they missed opportunities by the narrowest of margins, and yet, it feels like Japan's performance deserved something from the game. I think the way they played the second half of Japanese, they were much lighter, I'd say, sides. I mean, I think most people just watch football, and if you've not got to say that you are behind right from the start, you want to say that it's trying harder, you want to say there's more energetic, there are lives there that are not just taking it all for granted, and that was the Japanese side in the second half, and I thought they were growing actually superb, and never stopped. I kept on waiting for them to run out of gas, and it never seemed to happen, so I was brilliant to say that, and of course, Gundurren has to kind of say that to some degree, but I don't think it's that amazing that the result ended up the way it was, purely by the way the game was played. And it is a shock, but can I suggest this to you? Here are the last games they played in competitions with Germans. In Russia, lost to Mexico, lost to South Korea, they won against Sweden in 95-minute, 95-minute winner. Euros lost to France, won Portugal, drew Hungary, lost England, this time lost Japan. That's play date, they've only won two. It isn't going to be a shock anymore if they keep on playing with major championships. And maybe it wasn't a shock in terms of, as you say, the form coming into this one, but that scoreline of Germany won Japan too, will still send shockwaves through this World Cup, especially because Germany haven't lost a World Cup game in which they led at half time since 1978 in Argentina when they were 3-2 up against Austria and they went unbeaten in their previous 21 matches like that before today. Spain though go on and make a 7-0 winning performance against Costa Rica and they were just extraordinary. And I know Costa Rica didn't put up much opposition, but it's still a game in which Spain have got a record of such narrow wins in these competitions that have a real chance. At least they look that way of going on and being some way successful in this competition. One quite line about them, very simple line about them. I didn't know when you commit this tournament, something a team can flourish. And I just didn't know about it. I thought it would be too early for the Spanish. You're seeing the petals opening now. We're absolutely seeing them opening now, so I think that's exciting for the Spanish. We could get anything from here on in, but the youngsters, they were brilliant today. They were fantastic. It was a brilliant performance from Spain, even regardless of the opposition with that 7-0 victory for them. Tomorrow there are four games for you as well, including one of the favourites, Brazil, yet to get their campaign underway. That's across Five Live and BBC sounds. You've got Rick Edwards on BBC Five Live Breakfast, rather, from Qatar from 6 o'clock in the morning. 10 o'clock, Switzerland against Cameroon. 1 o'clock is Uruguay against South Korea. Portugal take on Ghana at 4 o'clock. Guess who will be featured heavily ahead of that game. And then Brazil take on Serbia. That one is a 7 o'clock kickoff. You will not miss a single commentary here on Five Live Sporting. It will be covered right across Five Live and on BBC sounds. The players are getting set to come out of the tunnel for the second half in the game between Belgium and Canada. It's 1-0 to Belgium as things stand and therefore is for the second half. It's Dion Dublin and John Murray. Thank you very much, Kelly. It looks like Belgium are going to make a couple of changes. So even though they scored that goal late in the first half, Roberto Martinez is going to make those changes. We'll say thank you very much to Julian Laurent, who has been up here in our commentary position. We'll hear from Julian again, I'm sure, before too long at this World Cup. But the two changes, Dion, it looks like Kerasko has been taken up from the left-hand side, the left wing back. And as a result, instead, Castania is going to move across to the left. And Thomas Mounier has made his return. And he's got a mask on as well. Remember the problem with Thomas Mounier, the Borussia Dortmund man as he is now, is that he had a broken cheekbone. He broke his cheekbone last month and so was doubtful for this game. Roberto Martinez has brought him on at half-time. And the other change in central midfield, Keelamans has been taken off at half-time. And it's the young Evertonian, Amadou Onana, who has come on to replace him. Maybe they just want to get more control of the ball in there, maybe a bit more physical presence in there as well. I mean, I'm looking at Castania now. He's so much higher up the pitch than he was in the first half. So two changes for Roberto Martinez, but his team are winning by one goal to nil. But he can't have been happy with what he saw in the first half by a long shot, particularly the way that Belgium defended, conceded the penalty, which is a little unfortunate, one of those handballs from a powerful shot. But might have conceded at least one more penalty and could open on a number of occasions. Yeah, and that's just down to the hard work of the Canadian players. Now Belgium are trying to grasp this game, take control of it. They're making the pitch very, very big indeed. Big areas for the Canadian players to run into to try and squeeze now. It's going to be a different game in the second half. That's Dion Dublin with us here at the Akhmud bin Ali stadium, two-tier stadium all the way around, colourful red seats, purple hoardings everywhere. The pink World Cup livery, and I would have said something in the region of 35,000 or so people inside the stadium. So not quite full. Belgium leading by one goal to nil. Belgium in the red shirts with the black trim, black shorts, and these sort of black and red socks that have a design on them that makes it look as though their feet are on fire. There's sort of flames licking up from their boots, I know it is. And Canada in the all-white kit with the red trim, they've just won a free kick inside their own half Bat-Chouay. So Canada with the free kick and the teams. Now Courtois in goal for Belgium, the penalty saver in the first half. Dendonka, Aldervire Olden-Fortonghen are the three central defenders. Now Thomas Murnier the right wing back, Castaniers moved across to be the left wing back. And Nanna and Witzel in the middle, then De Bruyne, Azad and goal scorer Batchouay. Canada coming forward with Buchanan who's really been one of the brightest players for this Canadian team. Holds off the challenge from Castania, plays it back centrally. Lovely from Ustakayo, plays it into the error. Bound the header goes wide from David. Ten yards out, snatched at it really with his head. It was coming over his shoulder and he nodded it down and it bounced wide. It's a lovely ball as well isn't it? Should really score, he's eight yards out, it's not a bad header at all. I think he gets a nutmegs I think on Kevin De Bruyne. That'll go down in his history books. That was Ustakayo. Well that is definitely one too. It'll be clipping that one up once, the Oris Fernsdon family will be for the old social media. Belgium playing for Tonga has just gone down onto one knee and now climbs up and he seems okay. Castania is just looking at him there to see if he's alright but he is so the throwing is going to be taken. Great moment for Stefan Ustakayo who Julian was talking about, it wasn't he at half time. The Canadian number seven who plays for Porto, Porto started all of their group matches in the Champions League this season and they ended up winning the group. They'll play Inter in the last 16 and here come Belgium though. Wanderlup, Batua'i shifting from foot to foot, a little shimmy from him as well against Lariat and then passes the ball back into his own half and then a little tangle as well. A notice between Lariat and Batua'i off the ball just pushing one another away with their arms and then back the ball goes into the middle of the Belgian defence. Four minutes played in the second half and Azad allows the ball to bounce through but it doesn't reach Batua'i and that's a lovely turn from David away from the newly arrived Anana and now he has Alfonso Davis and Davis plays it square to Ustakayo but it just ran away from him. He's on his right foot though and he goes for goal from the angle but pulls it well wide across the face of goal. There were two men in there, Buchanan and David but it was whipped across them and wider the far left. Yeah he was never comfortable at all, he's 22 yards out, 23 yards out on the angle, Ustakayo just pulls it. Tebow-Corto are just letting that one just run off for a goal kick harmlessly. Davis there trying to get into those dangerous areas as well. If he can get forward a bit more they might get a little bit of joy. He's the key for them, he's the key for Canada. The ball being headed back by central defender Vittoria to his goalkeeper. I was asking you Deon, we never got a chance to get the answer. You know to be in a team that does what they did in the first half Canada and then to find themselves one-nil down to a late goal, the effect that that has but he has Junior Hoylert on the left hand side, the Reading man. Plays it back but a little bit short the pass and that meant that Murnier could get in there but Azad won't reach that and it's absolutely walloped forward by Vittoria who lands it in amongst the Canadian supporters over on the far side and they're absolutely loving that, they love that don't they in North American sport. Oh yes. The ball goes into the crowd, it's like the event of the night. Yes they have a bit of a juggle with it, hold on to it for a little while as well. But in answer to your question Johnny you can be kind of demoralising when you played so well and then you find yourself down at half time and you've dominated the first half for 35 minutes but it's just all about putting the ball in the back of the net. The ball played back to Courtois, he's got to be quick now that was hit with some pace by Castaña and Courtois had to get that under control and Buchanan wasn't far away from him but he did, he managed to get it down, get it away and Belgium have got it inside their own half. Witzel's going to give him another test with the back pass which he pulls onto his left foot and then passes out towards the left hand side. Good from Castaña to Kevin de Bruyne, a little bit deeper, it's Dion said in the first half we didn't see much of Kevin de Bruyne back inside his own half, I assume that is on orders from the manager, from Roberto Martinez, the former FA Cup winning manager with Wigan Athletic, Onnana, now to the right hand side, Amadou Onnana, the new signing for Everton at the start of this season from Lille, very highly thought of, 21 years old now here he is playing in a World Cup and Azard is inside his own half, halfway inside his own half and passing the ball back to Fatoum forward from Alderviro, Alderviro to whose pass led to the Batuay goal and now Eden Azard has got space, plays the ball in field, de Bruyne is there, square from him, into Onnana, Onnana, right footed ball, over hits it, what an opening that was for Onnana and Spade again, Belgium there, Onnana in the kind of position that, I'm tempted to say we just wouldn't see that in the Premier League No, absolutely not. The number of times Belgium have been given time and space and haven't taken advantage of it. No, it's just that wrong ball again, it's having so many options and choosing the wrong one every single time they should really be making better use of those chances that they have but they've got the goal they need at the moment It could be two, it could be three. It is only one though and it's been a collision there in centre field That's going to be a yellow card for Murnier from the Zambian referee, Yanni Sekazwe says that was an illegal challenge I guess he must have seen an arm, a flailing arm from Murnier, yes he did, on Junior Highlet he caught him with his forearm and Murnier who himself, last month fractured his cheekbone from an aerial challenge has caught Highlet who is okay, I'm pleased to say but it's a yellow card for Murnier Even though it was clumsy, very very clumsy but it's probably a subconscious thing there, thinking I've got to protect myself not a failing elbow at all but just caught him So Murnier is yellow card, it's a 60th cap tonight, Thomas Murnier So free kick then, as a result for Canada, forward and left of the centre circle, Belgium holding a very high line just waiting for the delivery from Bustacchio, who just waits and waits and now he comes up and he plays the free kick over the back line but he's put too much on And that's why, out of error he would say get out, he's seen to his team mates there, there was nine of them in a line red shirts, nine and don't go anywhere, he's got his arms out by his side like it's an error playing, they're saying this is the line, stay here and that forces the goalkeeper to have lots and lots of space And Dendonca has got to be careful here, David is putting a challenge in on him next to the dead ball line, that was playing out from the back, goes wrong again and it's resulted in a Canadian corner Yeah that's a really good play, really good play that is, forcing Belgium into another mistake See this could be dangerous, out from the corner, from the left hand side for Canada It is, so we'll see once again, Camal Miller just arriving in the penalty area He's the sort of guy who could really have a presence in the opposing penalty area Miller very strongly built, the corner is taken short and they lose it The belly got into the penalty area and Belgium were able to nip in and clear it away downfield In fact it was De Bruyne who was able to get in there and clear it away, that was a waste of opportunity Yeah get the ball in the box, you've got your centre halves up, I was a centre half now Scream and get the ball in the box, make sure you don't waste my time Lovely from Buchanan, hooked it over the top of Fadongan, goes for goal actually from the angle At least that's what I assume he was doing, maybe it was a cross But I think he saw Courtois perhaps off his line and went for it But he ballooned it, bent it way over the top of the crossbar from an impossible angle really It's not bad skill at all from Buchanan down the right hand side Fadongan there, he was just trying to head it and took it over his head and got the ball wrong John Herb is going to make a change and another Canadian player has gone down, that's another It was a Nanna who was going to come, he's booked for that, a Nanna coming together He was carrying the ball away and that is a yellow card for the other Belgian substitutes So both of the Belgian subs who came on at half time, a Nanna and Murnier have now been yellow carded I think he's actually been told to come on and just a bit more physical presence Not a lot in that to be honest with you Just an arm off, just a hand off Yeah, just a hand off there, may have caught him with the forearm but nothing at all, players are on the feet Yellow card though, he's got a yellow card for that The Canadian coach John Herbman is going to make a double change now There'll be his first two changes, Belgium are winning 1-0, this is 5-live and BBC sounds Wherever you go during the course of this World Cup, I know you'll be busy during the day These early kick-offs back at home, 10 o'clock in the morning You can follow us on your device via BBC sounds Here's Azard, I see Kyle Lahren of Club Bruges is going to be one of the players coming on for Canada They're centre forward, who is Canada's record scorer So John Herbman feeling that they're not able to find the net So he's going to bring on the man who scored more goals for Canada than anyone else And Ismail Cone is coming on as well, 20-year-old midfielder For his first taste of the World Cup And Junior Hoylert is the first number to go up, the number 10 So Kyle Lahren coming on for him And it is Atiba Hutchinson as I did wonder whether he would last the distance And he's lasted almost an hour, the oldest player at this World Cup The oldest outfield player at this World Cup The second oldest outfield player ever to play in the World Cup Is now getting high fives and low fives and pats on the back from all of his teammates It's an amazing story, he just got a little bit leggy, he was getting heavy-legged 39 years old, that's not bad Oh he tied at 39, wasn't playing international football at 39 Well when I said to Vincent Company, he said there's someone playing in this match who's older than me So those two changes are made And as I say, it is Ismail Cone The 39 year old is replaced by the 20 year old in midfield And it is a free kick to Belgium, halfway inside their own half Great story, Cone as well at 20, he only made his professional debut in February And after seven appearances, won his first cap and now he's playing at the World Cup That's not bad And it is Canada, and here he is actually, the newly arrived, number 15 Cone Estaccio works it to the left hand side And Jonathan David is out there and he gets the ball down and he cuts in field on his right foot But he couldn't find the pass into the area, still battling for it on the edge of the box And it loops right across the edge of the penalty area And Belgium are able to clear it away In this second half, as we look, Canada in the white are playing from left to right And here the ball is played to the left hand side again And this time it's Buchanan who's over there and he's upended by Mounier who's already on a yellow card It is a free kick, I don't think it'll be any more than that, but he has to be careful Yeah, committed, Mounier there, really did, some nice little bit of foot to foot skill there Very, very good play from Buchanan, but you've got to do it more, you've got to do it more You've got to commit those players that have got a yellow card into challenges Are they going to be disciplined? Another high line as well Another high line from Belgium on the edge of the 18 yard line But now they've got the 6 foot 2 Kyle Lahren in there as well, the silent giant as they're calling It won't be silent if he puts this in the back of the net Canada still looking for their first goal at a World Cup in their second appearance at the tournament finals Free kick on the left hand side It's the Canadian fans voices that you can hear in that corner That's where all of the Wales fans were in this stadium the other night Here's the free kick from Estakio, he's put too much on that, bend it way beyond the far post and it's all the way through And another set piece of disappointment for Canada Yeah, that's poor from Estakio on the left hand side trying to curl it in towards the keeper But put it into that area where all the white shirt, don't try and put too much on it Just make sure it gets in the right area, that's the whole idea Belgium 1, Canada 0 and Belgium very nearly again lose the ball playing out from the back However this time they've been able to work it forward to Azad And Azad being challenged by Johnston, Azad back to Whitzel And Belgium now with the ball in centre field It's still uncomfortable for Belgium this It is, they want the game a little bit slower, they want it slow, quick, quick, slow That's how they want it, Canada wants it quick all the time So they're just trying to slow it down, draw out those white shirts and then they play their football Belgium And for Tongan under pressure, clearance is charged down by Davis And the ball is out of play for what he's given us as a throw We're going to see the latest Belgian change and it's Aidan Hazard, the captain is off So both captains have been substituted and coming on for Belgium, it is the Brighton man Leandro Trossard Who personally I feel is one of the best players in the Premier League this season Every time I see him, he impresses me, scored a hat-triggered Anfield this season And here he comes now for his first taste of the World Cup Leandro Trossard replaces Aidan Hazard, who has what, slitted in and out of the game Aidan Hazard tonight Yeah, he's wanting to do what he's done for years but he just hasn't got that lightning pace anymore Great feet, great balance but hasn't affected the game as he wanted to Canada with the ball on the right hand side, it is played back, Buchanan's onto this But he gets right underneath the shot and he has almost landed it in the middle tier Of the stadium, in fact it was caught there by a spectator who is standing right on the back row of the lower tier And that also was wasteful from Buchanan, who's been excellent, he's been excellent all the way up to that final third That final third, that last shot, that last pass, I mean Buchanan there, the ball's ended up on the edge of the D 20 yards out, 25 yards out and he wound himself up that much that it's just landed Nearly in that second tier, just take your time, that's what I was saying to Kelly at half time If they could calm down with their finishing, they might have a more of a chance in this game So you've got to say, telling Kelly to calm down Oh no, nobody can get Kelly to calm down, you're joking, impossible Well, Belgium 1, Canada 0 is the score and we've got just over 25 minutes to play Four more commentaries tomorrow as the final two groups get underway, groups G and H So tomorrow night, this time if you're listening to Five Live, you will be listening to Brazil against Serbia Which I think is an interesting one, but whenever Brazil play at the World Cup, you want to be tuned into it Belgium with it, with Trossard And now Murnier, and Murnier's crosses deflected straight behind by the defender, by Vittoria for a corner to Roberto Martín as a side Yeah, Trossard in such good form in the Premier League, it wouldn't surprise me if he gets himself on the scoresheet He doesn't panic when he gets in front of goal Kevin De Bruyne who's being cheered there, that's the area where most of the Belgian supporters are gathered in there The Red Devils, Le Diable Rouge, and they've got their wigs and they've got their Belgian flags And they're watching Kevin De Bruyne take this corner, a deep one to the back post that is headed down by Dendonca And there might have been a handball in there and it's a free kick to Canada on the edge of their own penalty area So Canada will reset themselves again, one-nil Belgium lead, Batuay's go Yeah, even though Belgium have started to get a grip of this game and play it at their pace, there's only one goal in this game Canada still can get something out of this game if they can find a little bit more form than they had in the first half, a bit more confidence They're still in this game Here's Onana, Onana in the centre circle, this is powerful still from him, takes it on into the penalty area And then it bounces away from him, it might have been fouled right on the edge of the box by Cone who went with him And he could have gone down, he stumbled, he missed control of the ball and it bounced away from him Yeah, I think he'd actually got away from Cone but then his touch was bad and it went into the keeper He lost his balance, he actually did well to stay on his feet there and he could have shot for goal but his touch was poor That might have been a foul on Fatongan, no it's not given And so Kyle Lahren is able to take it on and pass it back towards the edge of the penalty area And it's worked square by Davis and Estaccio's under this and Estaccio's square to Davis again who tried to give him it back But he gave it straight to Belgium and it bounced forward to De Bruyne and De Bruyne has passed to Batuaille He is intercepted by a sliding Camal Miller who gets to his feet and celebrates The fact that he put in what was a very important challenge and took the ball away from Batuaille So Canada again, come forward, Buchanan now on the left hand side He's very much in a roving sort of role, Buchanan and then Davis to the right, Johnston Now it's hit low and well wide actually by Larria with a shot, sort of snapshot from the edge of the area from a slight angle on the right But wider than near post by a yard Yeah, good for Canada though because they're getting more of Davis on the ball in that sort of central area so it can affect things I'm very surprised that I think I've seen Kevin De Bruyne misplace two passes tonight Important passes as well Belgium playing the ball out from the back again That's what they want, Belgium, they want this second goal And here is Kevin De Bruyne who rides two challenges and he's got away from Portofen And De Bruyne now, square to Batuaille, right foot shot is blocked and a super block that was Larria coming back and throwing himself in front of Batuaille as he hit the shot And was able to deflect it well wide and behind for a corner That is brilliant defending by the way because Kevin De Bruyne is on the right hand side I think it's Trossard that's flying in, he's taking all the defenders away and Larria has come from 30, 40 yards Splinted, what a block, brilliant block, 18 yards out Saved himself and his team an extra goal Here's the corner though for Belgium from De Bruyne that is headed up in the air and then Canada clear But that's a slip and that means Belgium are back in business with Trossard who over hits the pass to Witzel on the left hand side But Batuaille is out there as well and now the ball is played centrally on Nanna A touch to his right to Murnier, De Bruyne is there as well, this is 30 yards from the Canadian goal Trossard in a central position and the Brighton man gives it to the Leicester man, Castagna And now Batuaille inside the box, he's got to beat two men, he's still going inside the penalty area But eventually it gets away from him, there were just too many legs in there in the end, Canadian legs that is And they were able to scrape it away Yeah that defence not moving on that occasion, not getting sucked into the good play that Belgium are having now in 30 yards In the final third The ball back with Couretois in the goal to our right Batongan back to Couretois and his long clearance to the half way line is headed in field by Johnston And now Witzel back to Trossard again, this is still in the central third of the field And Witzel will play it back into the line of the three central defenders Then Donka on the right hand side, now Murnier with the black mask on his face, on Nanna Turn from him, that was clever stuff Witzel then sends it forward to De Bruyne, whose pass is over hit again, Dion Over hit from the great man, Couretois, goalkeeper Not quite on it at the moment De Bruyne, he's getting more and more of the ball and he's going to continue to affect this game in a positive way He's in the middle of the pot, right in the centre of the pitch, he's got Witzel behind him He's got Trossard in front of him, he's just left to do what he needs to do He's got the protection all around him, so those misplaced passes will become good ones very very soon That's Dion Dublin with us here in Qatar at the World Cup And Belgium with Witzel inside their own half The other thing that will be happening tomorrow as well as four more World Cup commentaries England and Wales will be doing their talking tomorrow ahead of the second group matches That will be played on Friday, so that will be played on Thursday As the ball bounces forward towards De Bruyne, but it bounces away from him Kostanio was trying to take it on, but Canada have cleared it downfield and then out from the back Then Donca comes to put it out of play on the far side They had a chance then Canada, they broke down for Belgium, it was five on five They really should have went with pace, chose the right decisions I think it was David there and Larrin choosing the wrong options, not getting past that first red shirt Another good chance gone Here's Buchanan on the left hand side, Buchanan moving infield And then a little touch out to the far side by Kyle Larrin And then Canada played, that's a misplaced pass actually And Estaccio had to be sharp there, otherwise Trossard was on to that, but he was He just got there, the Porto man, and now he's on his feet again, but over hits the pass through And Alderviral can come across and put it out of play Davis takes a quick throw to Estaccio, Davis again Alfonso Davis Always giving it away, he's passed the ball to Kevin De Bruyne That could be costly, and De Bruyne has got away from Johnston And now Kevin De Bruyne making ground up the left hand side, he's gone for the early pass Batchouais on the far side of the penalty area, tried to pull it down But the touch was heavy and ran away from him out for a throw on the far side Yeah, the correct ball from Kevin De Bruyne, but it was just a poor touch from Batswijk And then his left shoulder trying to bring it down on the volley, tough tough Normally when we see Kevin De Bruyne put those sort of passes across It's not meant to be disrespectful to Batchouais, but you see people like Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden Pulling those down into the ground Yeah, playing in a completely different way He has Buchanan though, running forward for Canada and playing the ball behind Kyle Lahren So Belgium were able to get that away again That's happened so many times, isn't it? So much positive play from Canada, really asking questions and posing problems for Belgium So really The final pass, it's just, you know, it's sometimes a great run But then the play on the balls played the pass where he was stood And it just seems to be falling into the hands of a redshirt every single time But they're being incredibly positive still, Canada Kone's come on and made a difference, Buchanan's really positive as well Lahren's really trying to make as many runs as he possibly can They're still in this one and they're very positive with their play Canada again with it in the centre circle, Vittoria goes for the long pass Lahren's come for it, but he was well watched actually by Dendonka Who was able to move across and head it down Grones from the Belgian fans inside the ground, Batchouais It doesn't stick with him again, so Canada play it forward But Johnston's beaten to it by Castania Castania just has to check back and now Trossard turns And then gives it to Kevin De Bruyne just forward of the centre circle And he finds Batchouais out towards the right-hand side Now back to Trossard, edge of the box on his left foot The tackle's going and the tackle was effective actually In the end from Vittoria Who was able to take it away from Trossard Long pass downfield for Canada, but I think that's asking too much Of Lariat it is and it's through for a goal kick One-nil Belgium lead Just to clarify Beginning to lose track of what day of the week it is here It's a wetten's day today, so tomorrow England and Wales will be doing their talking And then on Friday it will be England against USA and Wales against Iran Another change for Canada Sam Adakubi has come on to replace Lariat Who was playing on the right-hand side of midfield Now Adakubi as a left back Plays in Turkey for Haidtay Spor in the Turkish Super League So he has gone over there onto the left-hand side So that is the number three for Canada John Hoedman has certainly switched it up here hasn't he In terms of rather Graham Potter like He's been moving his pieces around the various formations that he's deployed here Davis Alfonso Davis has had a spell on the right-hand side He's played at left back Now Adakubi has come on at left back and Davis has gone over into left midfield And Belgium played forward but that will bounce through to goalkeeper He's back in his bench isn't he? He's back in his bench He likes his squad, he trusts everybody and everybody is getting some bit of time And if he needs to bring off some of the players that have done well from today Then he knows he looks over his shoulder and he thinks, yeah I trust my bench One-nil Belgium lead, so this match is still in the balance And it's a performance this I've seen enough tournament football and seen teams play their opening matches To know that this is a performance that will receive some criticism in Belgium I'm absolutely certain of that unless they've run away with it in the last 15 minutes or whatever But Canada have posed them problems and I think it's going to be very interesting to see what happens to Canada From this point on their matches against Croatia and Morocco Ball on the left-hand side but that's an easy one for Belgium to deal with And Courtois pluses it away from the back 15 minutes or thereabouts to go, plus added time That might be another 15 minutes Belgium left-footed ball forward to the halfway line That Miller heads that forward And now Atacoubi it is getting his first touches of the match Londoner Atacoubi incidentally did have a spell at Brighton on loan He's played in Norway, now he's playing in the World Cup And now we're watching Buchanan on the right-hand side again Buchanan plays it across, Lauren the ball got away from him at the crucial moment And Alderv-Ireld was able to step in and clear it away Buchanan sat down, he might have a problem He's certainly hoping not, he's trying to get to his feet Is it cramp, Jonas just cramp? Ah that's okay Stacchio Right-footed pass right across the field to the left-hand side here And then back it goes into the centre-circle to the chiseled beard of Vittoria Slip from Cone but he's able to get up and play it back And the ball is worked over towards the left-hand side They're going to make another couple of changes, one apiece For Canada, Jonathan Asorio is going to come onto the field His Colombian heritage They are an exceptionally diverse bunch as well, this Canadian squad There's heritage there from all over the world There's a long passes played forward towards the left-hand side for Canada That is Davis who is over there again Adacubi hits a high ball to Larria on the edge of the penalty area And now the shot on the turn from David that hit a body in there And hopefully in the crowd amongst all of those maple leaves on the far side For a possible penalty but nothing doing certainly for that one Buchanan who's shaken off his little bout of cramp He crosses from the right and Belgium cleared away on the edge of the box Adacubi again on the left-hand side with the turquoise boots Now Stacchio who's been very influential in the midfield in this match The number seven Vittoria, the central defender right footed pass from him out to the far side Now Jump and Murnier gets there first and heads it out of play away from Adacubi Throwing to Canada and we will see these changes now So Jonathan Asorio coming on for Canada But first it is going to be Lewis Appenda coming on to replace Baciuai Who I think has laboured a little bit in the second half The young forward Appenda who actually scored in that warm-up match against Egypt Last week the Lons striker 22 years old He's going to replace the goal scorer Baciuai Yeah Baciuai just got a little bit lazy in the latter stages He's going to be a bit leggy of course he has took his goal brilliantly Yes he did but I think the players in and around have got a bit frustrated He started to flick things and not hold it in and put his team under pressure So get him off, get him fresh legs again, bit of a rest and getting ready for the next game So Appenda is on, no Lukaku if you're wondering by the way He's had a hamstring problem and so Roberto Martínez taking no chances with him With most of the World Cup still ahead of us But Appenda is on up front and the ball bounces off by a distance actually But he's able to chase after it and Belgium move forward again But the ball to the left hand side, Castagna to Trossard who tried to give him it back But Buchanan is there and Buchanan is being manhandled by Castagna And that is a clear free kick Didn't like that did he Buchanan? Hey, bit of physical contact He's still trying to jump off that cramp It's so painful when you get bowed to cramp in one area It's really hard to get rid of If you're on your way home tonight this match is live on BBC Television incident You might be able to see the last knockings of it You might see Canada's first goal at a World Cup If they're able to find a way through At the moment, they had a chance early on in the match What a chance as well, the penalty that they had Alfonso Davis having it saved by Courtois That was way back in the 11th minute And now one nail down How they will rue that if this is the final score But it's not over yet and Johnston crosses And there's the header from Larin that is saved by Courtois to his right And actually caught by him as well He's about 5 yards further out than the 18-yard box And he just crosses it He doesn't even look, just whips it into that area Just couldn't get enough on the header Larin, really difficult header But Courtois dealt with it Like the top-class goalkeeper he is When he's been called on tonight Courtois again has done his job That performance, I don't think I'll ever forget That goalkeeping performance in the Champions League final last season From another match And that's it for Buchanan Well, he's done well tonight And also coming off is Ostacchio So two of the star men have been taken off by John Herdman For the last 15 minutes Yeah, he's probably resting them, I would imagine He has Larin on the right-hand side Larin for Canada Now Davis And Davis hits a low ball into the area Poor contact door from Davis Easily cleared away And then there's a collision Trossard on Davis And that's a yellow card for that challenge Just stretching into it A little clumsy from Alfonso Davis Yellow card Yeah, I think he just caught Trossard high on the knee there Unintentional, to be honest with you But referees on the spot Trossard still down Maybe a painful one Yeah, just catches him on the ankle I think it was actually He's been good tonight I've enjoyed watching him play, Davis Very talented young man Played down the left, played down the middle Played anywhere Liam Miller has come on for Canada And also, as we said, Jonathan Asorio So Liam Miller, the former Liverpool youngster Who also played on loan for Kilmarnock and Charlton Just the one appearance for Liverpool In the FA Cup that Tygan Shrewsbury A couple of years ago So Liam Miller, the number 23 Is on playing on the left-hand side There he is now Over on that flank of the field And actually concedes a free kick That's his first contribution to the game Now playing his football for Basel, by the way, in Switzerland So a free kick to Belgium Over there on the far side of the field I think one or two have been headed off As I say, we're a good half-hours drive away from Central Doha, where we're sitting here inside the stadium Davis now bringing the ball in field He's away from Whitzel, plays it to the edge of the area He went down looking for the return But he's back up on his feet again And now, Canada with the ball on the edge Of the penalty area Asorio it is into the action for the first time But plays it forward and there's nobody there in a white shirt For Canada The line of Belgian defenders are able to clear it away Miller now takes it up for Canada again Miller slips into the box It might bounce for Canada But it is cleared away Just inside the penalty area by Aldervireld Canada come again They're certainly not giving this up As you would expect, they wouldn't one-nil down But in fact, it is Appenda Who's able to carry the ball away downfield And Alistair Johnston puts in the challenge Which receives a yellow card He was nearly away Appenda And Johnston just brought him down Yeah, I think Appenda was away A bit of a toss-up of five yards, the two of them And yes, he's at Lunge Johnston is just getting out four He's getting out muscled and he's He's out to bring Appenda down there With a bit of a scissor tackle from behind I think he was looking to take on the last defender as well So yeah, you can see that one So it's a free kick And actually Appenda has stayed down there And is actually receiving treatment So the physios are there The medical people just making sure that everything's okay With Asorio, with Appenda Certainly Roberto Martinez wouldn't want an injury to Appenda We're just saying it again Dion, it was a bit of a reckless challenge Yeah, it's very reckless It's a definite lunge At the point, he is low with his feet Yes, he's low with his feet and Appenda's in the air as well So none of his studs or feet are in the ground So he's up in the air, so which is good It's quite a relief, wasn't it? Absolutely For him there, and also it was a similar sort of challenge To the one that was put in on Harry Kane the other night Which led to the concern Yeah, clumsy I have to say, we got wind of that very late last night And that very much put a bit of a dampener on things But it seems, certainly the talk today The reports today are that Harry Kane was involved with training For England, down at Al-Wakra So we'll learn more about that I'm talking to Gareth Southgate tomorrow afternoon there So we'll get chapter and verse And see how things are exactly So listen out for that on Five Life Free kick though, that is played in by Tabrna But headed up and over the top of the crossbar By Dendonka, on the edge of the six yard box Yeah, good chat, just reaching Couldn't get high enough, couldn't get over it Always, always going over Another great ball in there from Kevin Dabrna So we have five minutes, just over five minutes to play Plus at a time, Belgium still leading Canada By one goal to nil And here's Kevin Dabrna, turns again And sets off on a run, a direct run to the edge of the day And goes for goal, but got right underneath the shot And lofted it high over the angle of post and bar Into the crowd And Canada have got the ball back very quickly And are already off downfield Having taken a very quick goal kick And in centre field, Kone turns Didn't have too many options So the momentum of that has been somewhat slowed At a Kube though, is able to get it down Osorio now, Osorio back to At a Kube Time beginning to run out for Canada Good looking, cross though, but Larry in the middle It was slightly behind him, he had to readjust And just ended up off balance, ballooning it High over the top I don't know whether to say they've been unlucky Or the quality's not been there I mean, some of the chances that they've had in the final That was a difficult one actually For Larry, the ball was slightly too high for him He couldn't get it down, he couldn't get over it But they've just got themselves into some really good positions They've played well tonight, they really have They just need to work on that That's Dion Dublin, this is Five Live And BBC sounds, be all up and running again At breakfast tomorrow morning with Rick Edwards Who's here with us in Qatar So from six o'clock, Five Live Breakfast at the World Cup I don't know if the Borebal Challenge will be back In operation tomorrow, have you done that yet Dion? Or have you managed to successfully avoid it? I think I've avoided that Have you? Do you want it? Well done Yes, I'm hoping to do the same myself Castaner heading it forward towards De Bruyne And De Bruyne now finds the ball to the edge of the area La Trossade, and Trossade now takes it Towards the dead ball line and overruns it in the end And it is a good kick, and it comes to nothing Not clicking for Belgium Not at the moment, it's not They've created some good half chances But Canada have stood firm, they've worked really hard Not a cramp out there now for the Canadian players They've worked so hard And this falls into the category of unconvincing Opening victory for Belgium Yes, I would say so I really want to say that they've managed the game well But they haven't been in total control of this game In order to call it good game management Just getting over the line, in my opinion Reaching into the book of cliched stereotypes It's also going to be a plucky opening defeat for Canada Or is it? As the ball bounces into the penalty area And Larrant was almost in But it just got away from him again at the crucial moment And across came Jan Fertongen to plant it out of play Yeah, just there were all three of them were there Davis was there, Lavin was there David was there as well The three of them, little over, ricocheted off a few defenders' legs And landed to a Belgium player yet again The silent giants being too silent They wanted to turn up the volume But they've lost possession, Asorio And so Belgium, long, long crossfield pass Which is headed back and down by David And now Davis takes it on through the middle Alfonso Davis, I've lost count now of the number of different positions Alfonso Davis has played in He's the heartbeat of this team He holds off Whitzel And he plays it to Miller on the left hand side And Miller with the right-footed cross And that's headed away though by Aldervirald in the middle And Canada have to start again from the halfway line I think they're going to run out of time We're in the 88th minute There's one more chance, John There's one more chance Let's see, here is Atacubi taking it on towards the dead ball line And winning a corner, it's a corner for Canada And it's at that end And of course, Canadian Maple Leaf flags are being waved again And now there are people down there dressed as Mounties as well Of course there are, there had to be And it's a corner that will be played in from the left hand side For Canada, this could be the final chance Who knows, and it goes, oh it's wasted It is utterly wasted, it's ballooned across from the left hand side Over everyone inside the box Whether they were in red or white, and it's a goal kick That's where you need a little bit of care And you just make sure the ball ends up in the heart Of that Belgium penalty area And he just puts too much on it Harmlessly goes out for a goal kick What a waste that is So looking down there to see the fourth official The Japanese fourth official Can't see the board yet But the 90 minutes are almost up Belgium leading Canada by one goal to nil As Belgium actually come forward with Murnier Just outside the area on his right foot Curled a shot with the outside of his boot It hit Victoria who was falling over at the time And bounces away wide And it is five minutes of added time Belgium have got five minutes Before they can record yet another opening win At a World Cup But actually this would equal the World Cup record Of eight consecutive World Cup group wins If they are able to see it out And at the moment they have got a corner So they are down the right end of the field To do just that Kevin De Bruyne over there Just lifts the ball up with the top of his foot Then puts it back in the quadrant Trossard makes a run over there Belgium looking to take this short Which they do And De Bruyne then receives it back And he is into the area And he shoots I think from a very tight angle But straight at goalkeeper Bojan Who is able to go down quite easily And hold it And then over arms it out here to the right hand side To Adakubi the left back Who is appearing now on the right wing Now in centre field Johnston plays it to Asorio Asorio just drifts away Keeps possession Still going Asorio Little pass forward to Corne Corne now to Alastair Johnson on the right hand side He puts his foot on the ball actually And Johnston crosses and it's deflected And Larin gets a header on it But he was impeded by Dendonka Who was in his way And he headed actually into the defender Looped up in the air And Courtois was able to make the catch Yes one of those catches They hold it for a couple of seconds And they fall on their elbows Kilowitter time Belgium I think will want this game Dunlund does today at ASAP They know they can play better than this Yeah this Has not done anything to Johnston company who I spoke to him earlier Described Belgium In terms of contenders to win this He said they're one of the outsiders Belgium and they've done nothing tonight To dispel that They will have to get better But of course in a tournament You can grow into a tournament And sometimes a disappointing start Is not the worst thing If you actually win the game But here's Miller Into the penalty area But his ball across is poor really Easily cleared away by Murnier And now Trossard has some space On the left hand side Trossard runs Just in front of where his manager Roberto Martinez Is standing there And then passes it back to De Bruyne And he has Witzel centrally Witzel back to a Nanna in the centre circle And the Everton man Exchanges passes with the Aston Villa man Then Donka And then here are the two old Tottenham boys Alderweirald and Fertonghen With it on the edge of the penalty area I mean if it stays like this It will be a clean sheet So they'll take the positives from that But it could easily not have been Yeah it's the only time in the game Where Belgium have had total control Right now The last couple of minutes Where they've just passed it about They've kept it Kevin De Bruyne is in charge And he's pointing He's telling everybody where to go But they haven't had it easy tonight Belgium not at all They're about to work really hard To get their goal We've now had three minutes of the five And Appenda is under the ball He's thinking about a shot from 25 yards But he actually in the end Came under pressure so played it back And it finds its way to Castaña On the left hand side Started as the right wing back Second half left wing back De Bruyne that's nice from him On the edge of the box Appenda is then challenged And the ball bounces back to goalkeeper Bojan So Canada need to go direct And they do from the goalkeeper This is a long one for Larin to chase But he won't reach that It's through bouncing onto the chest of Couretois Who's able to chest it down And now eventually picks it up And then just tosses it Almost basketball style to the left hand side Castaña whips it in field De Bruyne is there He lifted back to Castaña Who passes it forward to Trossard And Trossard is tackled successfully By Camal Miller Who has then gone down And I think that's a bit of cramp as well From the big central defender Yeah he's stretching there Played well tonight Miller really well In fact they've played well Defensively Canada tonight He stayed down He's just He's out of the Wes Morgan's Yes he is He's a build of central defender Absolutely right Yes he is Whole hearted defender Big chest Yeah big chest Strong, powerful Imposing, worked really hard Powerful run up Sweat dripping off his brow Worked really hard tonight Throw into Belgium We have 30 seconds of the 5 minutes to play So it's got to be now for Canada It's got to be this move Golkiba catches it from Appendaz Kross from the left hand side Munder arms it out And now Atacubi Atacubi to Osorio Belgium have dropped back Everyone apart from Appendaz Drop back into position here And they're allowing Osorio To carry the ball forward It's got to find a way past All of this red and black And that is it The whistle goes I'll make that a little short Of the 5 minutes Of added time From this referee Who is not averse to blowing early However, that is it That is the final whistle And that is a hard fought Opening win for Belgium And actually you can tell that From the reaction of their players Who look mighty relieved That they've got out of this With 3 points from their first match And for Canada Disappointment The missed penalty early in the match The opportunity to score their first goal At the World Cup That was not taken by Alfonso Davis A disappointing penalty That was comfortably saved By Courtois down to his right So they are still looking For that first point And first goal at a World Cup Belgium have won it 1-0 Dion? Yeah, I'm convinced by them At the moment Belgium they were OK tonight They just got over the line Yes, we know they have the quality Just can't get enough Oh, very clever John Just can't get enough That's the song playing in the background If you can't hear it Canada very impressed with them Worked really hard for 70% Of this game They were in it They created lots of chances They were very unlucky In front of goal I've got to say In regards to Ricochet He's off the shins They all fell to a Belgium red shirt But when they did have their chances They just snatched at them They didn't have the coolness of mind To hit the target and work Courtois, the quality showed They were unlucky Canada Belgium just, just deserved it So there we are Just the one goal so far In this group Morocco-Nil, Croatia-Nil In the first match today And now Belgium 1 Canada-Nil is the final score Here at the Ahmed bin Ali Do you know what you've both said it John Murray and Dion Dublin At the stadium four is this evening You've both said it And there was a kind of Underwhelming 1-0 victory For Belgium this one But for Canada This feels like a World Cup That they might not qualify From the group But there's certainly going to be Some performances in there That are going to be really enjoyable They faded a bit towards the end though, didn't they? Yeah, listen, I think I think Vittorio and Johnston And Milo at the back That little sort of free Did really well They worked really hard And I think it's down to them Defensively that only That Belgium only scored the 1 I don't know what it is with Belgium They're just looking a little bit leggy Ideas Kevin De Bruyne Wasn't on it tonight When he did put a couple of good crosses in I was kind of surprised that He put some good crosses in Yeah, just a little bit Not convinced at all If they want to really go any further In this they're going to have to pick it up 100% because any other team they play And they get that much time on the ball Like Canada did in the first half They'll score goals against Belgium John Hurdman's gathered together All of his players and the substitutes And all of the staff actually In the centre circle And they've created a ring around him And he's standing in there in the middle The Englishman And he's got his hand in one pocket He's making his point with the other hand He's turning around 360 degrees This is a very public show of Togetherness really From the Canadian team, the Canadian squad And he's clearly giving the message That in these coming matches For Canada, against Croatia and Morocco And they've now all turned in tightly together On him and are still all together In the centre circle in a very tight huddle Yeah, I think that's great I really do I really do He's basically saying, listen I can basically tell you what he's saying He's saying, listen, you guys did well tonight You're playing against a Belgium side One of the outsiders, whoever they are Got some of the best in the world But I am proud of you tonight Well done The fans are proud All the flags are being waved And the manager's proud They were unlucky tonight Very unlucky Yeah, most of the bulk of the Canadian fans Are still in their positions And he's now leading his team across there And he's applauding the spectators I mean, thousands of them, I hear I presume they'll have come, of course From Canada, probably from all corners of the world Here to Qatar And they've all got their Canadian flags The red and white with the maple leaf on And they're enjoying the moment together Even though they've lost the match
