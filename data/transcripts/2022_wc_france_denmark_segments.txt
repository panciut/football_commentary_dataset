[0.00 - 4.20] P:1724.67 E:0.055198 |  Damsegaard of Brentford on the left and Andreas Cornelius up front.
[4.20 - 7.40] P:1877.94 E:0.112772 |  The countdown is over, the match begins.
[7.40 - 11.80] P:1692.69 E:0.099911 |  It is France against Denmark, five live and BBC sounds.
[11.80 - 15.56] P:1428.00 E:0.102204 |  And the ball is immediately out of play for a throw-in to Denmark
[15.56 - 17.76] P:1495.54 E:0.087713 |  over on the far side of the field.
[17.76 - 19.40] P:1578.10 E:0.100494 |  That is the Danish right.
[19.40 - 23.20] P:1553.74 E:0.103677 |  They're playing from right to left as we look in this first half
[23.20 - 26.32] P:1539.00 E:0.096761 |  from high up on the dugout side of the ground.
[26.32 - 28.60] P:1521.82 E:0.096940 |  And he has Mala, the left wing back.
[28.80 - 33.20] P:1659.71 E:0.087912 |  Denmark tonight, white shirts, red shorts and white socks.
[33.20 - 35.48] P:1655.54 E:0.102238 |  And remember Denmark drew their first match,
[35.48 - 40.80] P:1795.76 E:0.089337 |  0-0 against Tunisia, one of the, as we discussed last night,
[40.80 - 45.80] P:1855.52 E:0.101010 |  five 0-0 draws that have been so far at this world cup.
[45.80 - 49.12] P:1798.44 E:0.114821 |  But the situation in the group now, after Australia's win earlier
[49.12 - 51.04] P:1693.13 E:0.099621 |  in the first match of the day,
[51.04 - 53.40] P:1634.51 E:0.115674 |  Australia now in second place in the group.
[53.40 - 56.32] P:1788.19 E:0.099824 |  So France with three points, Australia with three points,
[56.36 - 59.72] P:1724.40 E:0.097511 |  Denmark with one and Tunisia with one
[59.72 - 63.40] P:1569.89 E:0.086893 |  and seemingly on the brink of being knocked out.
[63.40 - 66.84] P:1652.98 E:0.097118 |  Their final match is against the world champions, France.
[66.84 - 68.88] P:1666.90 E:0.083476 |  So good luck with that Tunisia.
[68.88 - 71.32] P:1697.95 E:0.089112 |  But Denmark, coming through the middle,
[71.32 - 73.48] P:1661.90 E:0.102143 |  good possession from them in the early stages.
[73.48 - 76.48] P:1575.22 E:0.092467 |  Ball played out towards the left-hand side here.
[76.48 - 78.72] P:1618.94 E:0.091836 |  But across comes Dembele and France
[78.72 - 81.84] P:1682.78 E:0.100899 |  and the very dark blue shirts that they're wearing at this world cup.
[81.84 - 84.56] P:1709.62 E:0.087912 |  Try to come forward, white shorts, red socks.
[84.60 - 87.80] P:1585.89 E:0.084468 |  But the pass was over-hipped from Kunde at right back
[87.80 - 91.36] P:1715.00 E:0.096690 |  and it's out of play for a throw-in to Denmark.
[91.36 - 95.00] P:1752.32 E:0.092705 |  Just about halfway inside the French half.
[95.00 - 99.40] P:1790.06 E:0.100109 |  Kunde, who is playing at right back, preferred to Paver,
[99.40 - 102.52] P:1625.39 E:0.091014 |  even though he scored, he also committed the mistake
[102.52 - 104.56] P:1800.73 E:0.090403 |  that led to the Australian goal.
[104.56 - 107.24] P:1515.29 E:0.088087 |  And it is Denmark with it on the right-hand side.
[107.24 - 112.48] P:1767.54 E:0.098990 |  Here's Christensen of Leeds, wins a throw-in of Theo Hernandez
[112.48 - 115.24] P:1552.94 E:0.084049 |  and takes it back towards the halfway line.
[115.24 - 117.32] P:1584.77 E:0.091017 |  And then it comes all the way back to Christensen
[117.32 - 119.32] P:1502.89 E:0.094834 |  in the middle of the back three.
[119.32 - 122.64] P:1593.11 E:0.087783 |  And then to the left, Victor Nelson, who's coming to the back line.
[122.64 - 126.16] P:1639.85 E:0.093384 |  Blunted figure, as I said, Galatasaray defender.
[126.16 - 127.80] P:1670.10 E:0.095802 |  He plays it forward to Mela.
[127.80 - 129.92] P:1586.94 E:0.095618 |  And then Mela goes all the way back to Schmeichel,
[129.92 - 131.56] P:1670.38 E:0.083558 |  away in the goal to our right.
[131.56 - 136.16] P:1739.27 E:0.099096 |  Just looking at the position of Griezmann in that French midfielder.
[136.16 - 139.40] P:1742.95 E:0.090487 |  He's going to have to do, I think, a little bit extra tonight,
[139.40 - 142.04] P:1851.53 E:0.117899 |  alongside Tieu-Ameny and Rabiot on that midfield.
[142.08 - 145.48] P:1763.32 E:0.095803 |  Otherwise, France might find themselves outnumbered at times.
[145.48 - 147.60] P:1549.97 E:0.093451 |  It is Denmark still in possession.
[147.60 - 150.68] P:1541.37 E:0.088999 |  It's a really good confidence start from Denmark,
[150.68 - 152.88] P:1666.33 E:0.095260 |  ranked number 10 in the world.
[152.88 - 155.68] P:1566.84 E:0.102655 |  Certainly one of the best European sides around.
[155.68 - 159.48] P:1636.73 E:0.095091 |  They've been excellent under Kasper Kuhlman, semi-finalists, of course,
[159.48 - 161.00] P:1674.42 E:0.097308 |  at the Euros last year.
[161.00 - 163.48] P:1724.48 E:0.093908 |  Ball played through the middle and that's a foul.
[163.48 - 166.88] P:1768.24 E:0.096669 |  And it is a free kick for the challenger, Lynne Ström.
[166.88 - 168.88] P:1681.60 E:0.089222 |  So a free kick and a good position, Alan.
[168.88 - 171.56] P:1659.89 E:0.099814 |  Yeah, I mean, we've only had two and a half minutes gone, John,
[171.56 - 172.96] P:1518.54 E:0.111790 |  but it's all been Denmark.
[172.96 - 176.28] P:1779.75 E:0.104491 |  They're just playing themselves into the game and getting plenty of touches.
[176.28 - 178.40] P:1595.72 E:0.082668 |  And no pressure on them as yet from France.
[178.40 - 180.16] P:1482.74 E:0.091267 |  Yeah, just the start they'll have wanted.
[180.16 - 182.64] P:1673.62 E:0.085830 |  Tieu-Ameny conceded that free kick.
[182.64 - 184.00] P:1763.59 E:0.071683 |  It's played short,
[184.00 - 186.60] P:1640.80 E:0.094599 |  Mélat right-footed ball in from the left flank,
[186.60 - 188.60] P:1741.18 E:0.087514 |  but that is headed up in the way.
[188.60 - 192.52] P:1505.65 E:0.097893 |  It was Olivier Giroud back inside his own penalty area.
[192.52 - 195.00] P:1662.40 E:0.082212 |  He looks terrific, doesn't he, Giroud?
[195.00 - 196.80] P:1573.88 E:0.097034 |  Those two goals in the opening match.
[196.80 - 199.96] P:1611.79 E:0.094418 |  I mean, a striker can't ask for too much more than that
[199.96 - 201.96] P:1678.20 E:0.084927 |  from your first game at a tournament.
[201.96 - 204.48] P:1648.90 E:0.091314 |  He'll be desperate to get that record tonight,
[204.48 - 207.04] P:1756.65 E:0.114936 |  when he's on his own, not sharing it with Thierry Henry.
[207.04 - 208.36] P:1769.12 E:0.114605 |  He'll want that on his own.
[208.36 - 212.12] P:1691.19 E:0.103695 |  Here is Dembele now, down the right-hand side for France.
[212.12 - 213.96] P:1701.65 E:0.107078 |  Plays it across to Rabiol.
[213.96 - 217.16] P:1783.26 E:0.114024 |  Now here is Mbappe into the match for the first time.
[217.16 - 220.36] P:1709.99 E:0.113701 |  Just listen to the frisson of excitement
[220.36 - 222.68] P:1612.95 E:0.105315 |  as Mbappe takes possession of the ball.
[222.68 - 224.44] P:1779.77 E:0.081492 |  However, he lost it.
[224.44 - 228.32] P:1682.11 E:0.090155 |  And Denmark are able to bring it forward again in center field.
[228.32 - 231.68] P:1663.35 E:0.105493 |  And it is Damsegaard who turns away.
[231.68 - 234.76] P:1662.89 E:0.108407 |  And then the ball is played through the middle for Cornelius,
[234.76 - 236.36] P:1575.78 E:0.112384 |  who was slightly behind him,
[236.36 - 238.88] P:1698.83 E:0.100648 |  and he just tried to check himself and knock it into his stride,
[238.88 - 240.08] P:1341.65 E:0.076130 |  but missed it completely.
[240.08 - 242.28] P:1649.98 E:0.102671 |  Very good play from Olivier. That was John, wasn't it,
[242.28 - 244.32] P:1489.44 E:0.120972 |  when he was left with one-on-one with Mbappe,
[244.32 - 246.84] P:1783.73 E:0.099067 |  and he tried the old leg over the ball, didn't he,
[246.84 - 248.48] P:1608.90 E:0.115676 |  as if he wanted him to go one-way,
[248.48 - 249.76] P:1671.64 E:0.112458 |  but he wasn't having any of that.
[249.76 - 254.80] P:1712.24 E:0.096165 |  He just got his body in the way and then set Denmark on the attack.
[254.80 - 256.00] P:1416.92 E:0.106016 |  You know what I like about Denmark?
[256.00 - 257.08] P:1446.90 E:0.102597 |  We've seen quite a lot of them.
[257.12 - 259.08] P:1570.25 E:0.104437 |  You know, they've played England on a number of occasions
[259.08 - 260.96] P:1698.14 E:0.078503 |  over the course of recent years.
[260.96 - 263.96] P:1611.73 E:0.072199 |  They are a proper team.
[263.96 - 266.88] P:1668.85 E:0.088993 |  They're a proper international football team.
[266.88 - 269.52] P:1605.25 E:0.095176 |  And even on, yes, they've got stars out there.
[269.52 - 272.72] P:1675.02 E:0.092375 |  I mean, here's one of them, for example, Christian Ericsson,
[272.72 - 276.12] P:1607.76 E:0.088918 |  who just plays the ball back into the centre circle.
[276.12 - 278.44] P:1702.88 E:0.102398 |  But they've clearly got a really good thing going
[278.44 - 281.88] P:1737.72 E:0.097386 |  under Caspar Hulmann, who seems to be someone
[281.88 - 283.28] P:1667.19 E:0.114549 |  who's very, very well suited
[283.28 - 285.44] P:1619.85 E:0.085856 |  to international football management as well.
[285.44 - 287.88] P:1595.26 E:0.102557 |  It breaks down on the edge of the French penalty area,
[287.88 - 291.44] P:1636.35 E:0.083735 |  and it's taken out to the far side by Thael Hernandez,
[291.44 - 295.32] P:1739.13 E:0.098545 |  who tries to play it out off the Danish player,
[295.32 - 298.52] P:1672.66 E:0.080148 |  but fails to do so, so it's a throw-in to Denmark
[298.52 - 300.28] P:1552.65 E:0.100583 |  near the corner flag into the box.
[300.28 - 301.52] P:1617.38 E:0.095492 |  Oh, nice glancing header.
[301.52 - 303.76] P:1481.38 E:0.102685 |  Cornelius plays it right across the penalty area,
[303.76 - 304.96] P:1678.71 E:0.074190 |  but doesn't get that right.
[304.96 - 307.00] P:1596.21 E:0.119748 |  And France will bring it away
[307.00 - 311.20] P:1806.63 E:0.113325 |  unless Mell has ever to challenge Dembele, but he can't.
[311.20 - 314.12] P:1773.54 E:0.120251 |  He was just through fleet of foot for Dembele,
[314.12 - 316.76] P:1676.30 E:0.108635 |  and then he also takes on and beats Ericsson
[316.76 - 318.88] P:1589.63 E:0.112584 |  and plays it to the left-hand side to Rabiot,
[318.88 - 320.56] P:1708.61 E:0.110366 |  and now to the left-hand side,
[320.56 - 322.36] P:1608.45 E:0.120026 |  and Mbappe is beginning to move infield.
[322.36 - 324.36] P:1639.92 E:0.119426 |  He plays it to Dembele on the edge of the D,
[324.36 - 325.88] P:1804.90 E:0.115406 |  turns under his right foot and shoots,
[325.88 - 327.64] P:1619.73 E:0.094420 |  but there was a man there for Denmark
[327.64 - 328.96] P:1447.43 E:0.111061 |  who was able to block it away.
[328.96 - 330.48] P:1797.19 E:0.084597 |  Christian Ericsson it was,
[330.48 - 333.12] P:1627.46 E:0.100125 |  and Denmark have got it again on the edge of the penalty area.
[333.12 - 334.16] P:1419.81 E:0.098243 |  I think I can count tonight
[334.16 - 337.40] P:1531.89 E:0.095654 |  who the neutrals inside the stadium are supporting.
[337.40 - 338.36] P:1370.85 E:0.122868 |  Everyone loves a winner.
[338.36 - 340.48] P:1634.76 E:0.089531 |  Absolutely, yeah, you can feel the anticipation
[340.48 - 343.32] P:1626.37 E:0.097453 |  when Dembele and Mbappe gets the ball, don't you?
[343.32 - 348.16] P:1754.96 E:0.097600 |  But I was really impressed at the numbers that Denmark had back then.
[348.16 - 350.20] P:1874.01 E:0.119899 |  Every single one of them doing their job,
[350.20 - 353.52] P:1723.50 E:0.095703 |  and there was no space whatsoever for Dembele to run into.
[353.52 - 355.72] P:1564.12 E:0.093456 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill.
[355.72 - 360.36] P:1722.13 E:0.091037 |  Five minutes played, and Denmark again to the halfway line,
[360.36 - 362.44] P:1482.96 E:0.108364 |  trying to start a Mexican wave already
[362.44 - 364.08] P:1530.83 E:0.112475 |  over on the far side of the field.
[364.08 - 365.68] P:1696.39 E:0.095621 |  Shall we get up, John?
[365.68 - 368.32] P:1454.00 E:0.111543 |  And honestly, Arlene, I've got so much on the plate
[368.32 - 371.28] P:1599.21 E:0.105356 |  that this will come. I haven't got time for Mexican waves.
[371.40 - 373.88] P:1533.92 E:0.106233 |  It's nothing to do with your bad knees then.
[373.88 - 374.96] P:1305.83 E:0.111408 |  My knees are all right.
[374.96 - 375.80] P:1756.50 E:0.108415 |  Mine aren't.
[375.80 - 381.04] P:1628.36 E:0.092042 |  No, here's Christensen, and then to Nelson to the left.
[381.04 - 383.68] P:1719.45 E:0.104159 |  And then it's played forward by Jamsgaard,
[383.68 - 386.08] P:1706.08 E:0.113066 |  and now shuffled forward by Ericsson,
[386.08 - 388.80] P:1580.08 E:0.114304 |  who tries to roll it across into the path of Cornelius,
[388.80 - 392.32] P:1563.53 E:0.111049 |  but up on the corner came across and just leaned into Cornelius,
[392.32 - 395.20] P:1476.39 E:0.107325 |  and so France have got it on the edge of their own penalty area.
[395.20 - 397.48] P:1567.42 E:0.105907 |  And that's exactly what I was talking about
[397.48 - 398.72] P:1613.54 E:0.117153 |  in terms of the Griezmann,
[398.72 - 400.96] P:1665.68 E:0.106254 |  who's going to pick that midfield runner.
[400.96 - 404.24] P:1633.13 E:0.106474 |  This time it was Ericsson, he'd no-one run with him at all.
[404.24 - 406.52] P:1672.32 E:0.110377 |  He ran free up until about 25 yards out,
[406.52 - 409.88] P:1738.16 E:0.086463 |  and you can't allow that too many times with his ability.
[409.88 - 411.76] P:1608.94 E:0.097484 |  France bring the ball forward.
[411.76 - 413.96] P:1618.61 E:0.107630 |  It's an interesting choice tonight, Cornelius,
[413.96 - 418.20] P:1590.14 E:0.101116 |  the big man, six-foot-four, he's now back in Denmark,
[418.20 - 421.20] P:1594.94 E:0.101161 |  playing for FC Copenhagen, his former team,
[421.20 - 423.00] P:1513.22 E:0.124608 |  having been in Turkey where he did well
[423.00 - 425.88] P:1539.72 E:0.104360 |  when the league with Trabs on Spore last season,
[425.88 - 430.12] P:1535.22 E:0.103513 |  but he has actually not scored since he went back to Copenhagen
[430.12 - 431.56] P:1457.93 E:0.096016 |  for this season.
[431.56 - 436.92] P:1576.70 E:0.104603 |  So I guess he's going to act as the target man through the middle,
[436.92 - 440.96] P:1610.02 E:0.103640 |  and they'll look to get as many bodies into the penalty area to support him.
[440.96 - 442.88] P:1584.28 E:0.114399 |  But is France in possession at the moment,
[442.88 - 448.12] P:1597.82 E:0.089114 |  and the cheer is because that Mexican wave continues to make its way around the ground.
[448.12 - 451.00] P:1546.20 E:0.110047 |  We will have real maximum-convaved in four years' time
[451.00 - 456.08] P:1725.38 E:0.100966 |  when the World Cup has been hosted in Mexico and Canada and the United States.
[456.08 - 457.84] P:1486.69 E:0.111594 |  He has unbappé on the left-hand side,
[457.88 - 459.84] P:1675.87 E:0.098725 |  good work from Christensen.
[459.84 - 462.52] P:1579.88 E:0.111240 |  They went shoulder-to-shoulder, the two of them together,
[462.52 - 464.36] P:1491.78 E:0.107963 |  and it was the lead United man who was able to get down,
[464.36 - 466.64] P:1433.97 E:0.096875 |  put the challenge in and put it out of play on the far side.
[466.64 - 469.64] P:1724.70 E:0.099161 |  Twice he's had the ball, two opportunities to run at them,
[469.64 - 473.00] P:1691.60 E:0.096293 |  and twice he's been taken care of with ease,
[473.00 - 474.76] P:1744.87 E:0.109759 |  actually he used all that professionalism,
[474.76 - 476.80] P:1532.30 E:0.112267 |  stood in front of him and said, you're going nowhere.
[476.80 - 478.24] P:1679.18 E:0.096900 |  I've rather liked Christensen actually,
[478.24 - 480.12] P:1551.90 E:0.107008 |  when I've seen him for lead United this season.
[480.12 - 484.00] P:1577.06 E:0.103059 |  He has done belly back to Rabiola, his head tied back behind his head,
[484.00 - 485.96] P:1583.06 E:0.111246 |  and Baba has got space out on the far side,
[485.96 - 488.16] P:1545.85 E:0.102877 |  but he has to back away and take it down,
[488.16 - 491.08] P:1594.57 E:0.107422 |  and then unbappé plays it in, whipped delivery.
[491.08 - 494.88] P:1490.88 E:0.099242 |  Christensen actually didn't get there by the time unbappé had got under control.
[494.88 - 496.76] P:1428.58 E:0.103218 |  He was almost on the white line on the far side,
[496.76 - 500.96] P:1561.72 E:0.083871 |  and then went for that vicious delivery into the penalty area.
[500.96 - 503.08] P:1558.18 E:0.099041 |  The Denmark were able to head away.
[503.08 - 505.72] P:1565.47 E:0.111655 |  He was absolutely vibrant, wasn't he,
[505.72 - 508.44] P:1602.50 E:0.110791 |  when it came to the latter stages of the game against Australia?
[508.44 - 510.36] P:1621.77 E:0.109446 |  That's the problem you've got, they've gone tight on him,
[510.36 - 512.52] P:1732.48 E:0.107266 |  and they've took the ball off, and they stood up from this time,
[512.52 - 514.48] P:1633.43 E:0.110279 |  and he whipped that ball in with a bit of pace,
[514.52 - 516.52] P:1692.58 E:0.089991 |  looking for the height of Giroud,
[516.52 - 518.56] P:1721.18 E:0.083219 |  but Denmark just clear at just some time.
[518.56 - 520.00] P:1326.75 E:0.103287 |  France nailed Denmark, nailed.
[520.00 - 522.24] P:1449.49 E:0.097281 |  Really good to see Raphael Vuran down there,
[522.24 - 524.16] P:1420.91 E:0.089161 |  because it looked as though for all the world,
[524.16 - 526.88] P:1487.84 E:0.093596 |  that when he went down with that injury at Stamford Bridge,
[526.88 - 528.56] P:1634.18 E:0.089933 |  just a few weeks ago now,
[528.56 - 530.88] P:1559.10 E:0.089808 |  that there would be no world cup for him,
[530.88 - 535.80] P:1608.48 E:0.098806 |  but fortunately, it turned out to be not as serious as he initially thought,
[535.80 - 538.80] P:1501.36 E:0.100524 |  and here he is now, starting for France in the second match,
[538.80 - 542.96] P:1580.41 E:0.095412 |  so Ibrahim Kanate of Liverpool is back on the bench for this one.
[543.00 - 546.76] P:1636.40 E:0.100266 |  Nel-Nel the score, and France making ground through the middle,
[546.76 - 547.96] P:1532.99 E:0.104950 |  out towards the left-hand side,
[547.96 - 551.60] P:1754.60 E:0.106357 |  and Bapé looks to give it back down the left-hand side,
[551.60 - 554.60] P:1690.21 E:0.117729 |  Hernandez with a cross, deep on towards the far post,
[554.60 - 555.96] P:1804.07 E:0.119114 |  almost false for Giroud,
[555.96 - 558.16] P:1643.29 E:0.108014 |  it was knotted back across by Rabiot,
[558.16 - 559.60] P:1595.71 E:0.100518 |  but it wouldn't come down for him,
[559.60 - 562.44] P:1735.89 E:0.092882 |  actually it bounced up and bounced across him,
[562.44 - 563.88] P:1692.81 E:0.093536 |  before he could get the shot in.
[563.88 - 566.04] P:1625.24 E:0.095764 |  Very good play from France down that left-hand side,
[566.04 - 568.76] P:1713.42 E:0.110523 |  Hernandez shows pace, he whipped the great ball in,
[568.76 - 572.60] P:1817.44 E:0.102550 |  and Rabiot gets on the end of it and tries to knock it back into Giroud,
[572.60 - 575.56] P:1760.21 E:0.098568 |  but again, Denmark had the numbers back there to clear it.
[575.56 - 581.00] P:1590.12 E:0.089721 |  Yeah, great work from Rabiot to get himself into the penalty area at the back post.
[581.00 - 583.72] P:1788.88 E:0.098514 |  Very similar run to what he got his goal the other night.
[585.24 - 588.08] P:1669.65 E:0.095557 |  Almost 10 minutes played, and it is Nel-Nel,
[588.08 - 592.16] P:1621.66 E:0.080361 |  the Danish fans just gently bobbing up and down together,
[592.16 - 595.08] P:1644.79 E:0.083441 |  it's like the last night of the proms over there,
[595.08 - 600.36] P:1715.82 E:0.084804 |  as the ball is played by Mael at back into centerfield,
[600.40 - 602.88] P:1630.39 E:0.105686 |  Ericsson goes for a long pass out to Christensen,
[602.88 - 605.60] P:1585.77 E:0.107617 |  who's into the penalty area, rolls the ball over,
[605.60 - 606.84] P:1527.14 E:0.108407 |  it rolls the foot over the ball,
[606.84 - 609.24] P:1631.52 E:0.104312 |  then it played into the area and it was blocked away,
[609.24 - 611.60] P:1612.03 E:0.103347 |  and it hit the corner flag and it hasn't gone out,
[611.60 - 612.88] P:1579.23 E:0.107494 |  it stayed in the quadrant,
[612.88 - 616.44] P:1645.77 E:0.092511 |  so two players have to race full tilt, Denmark have got it,
[616.44 - 619.24] P:1772.17 E:0.109568 |  he has the cross, but Loris is able to come and catch it,
[619.24 - 622.60] P:1860.49 E:0.104700 |  arms high above his head, on the edge of the six-yard box.
[622.60 - 625.28] P:1801.63 E:0.106275 |  Very good goalkeeping, just what your central defenders need,
[625.28 - 628.68] P:1805.44 E:0.105308 |  when that ball's in there and you look as if and feel as if they're in trouble,
[628.68 - 631.48] P:1700.64 E:0.094913 |  you're looking for the goalkeeper to come and give you a little bit of a hand.
[632.44 - 635.28] P:1457.26 E:0.092622 |  Well, he's had his moments, hasn't he, this season, Loris,
[635.28 - 639.44] P:1581.89 E:0.085551 |  but in amongst all that, he'll make some amazing saves,
[639.44 - 643.28] P:1585.52 E:0.092985 |  and he's been such an important man in this French side,
[643.28 - 647.92] P:1728.57 E:0.090720 |  as the captain and the lead at, and Will Cuppen in captain, obviously,
[647.92 - 649.56] P:1801.40 E:0.112433 |  but Nations League, when in captain as well,
[649.56 - 653.96] P:1896.75 E:0.109759 |  and you are remembering, absolutely brilliant in that Nations League final,
[654.04 - 660.28] P:1868.55 E:0.100203 |  and tonight it is 141st tap for France,
[660.28 - 665.16] P:1686.38 E:0.091086 |  which means he's won behind the record holder, Lillian Turan,
[665.16 - 667.28] P:1564.06 E:0.089368 |  I'm guessing you probably played against,
[667.28 - 669.12] P:1524.70 E:0.087215 |  yeah, what a good play he was.
[669.12 - 671.24] P:1559.23 E:0.087804 |  That was superb, he was, not a bad record, is it?
[671.24 - 674.08] P:1479.88 E:0.117695 |  No, it's not, and Will Cuppen are in all that in his son,
[674.08 - 676.68] P:1713.08 E:0.097330 |  of course, on the bench, coming on the other night,
[677.56 - 680.44] P:1394.61 E:0.107753 |  as Denmark play the ball away towards the halfway line,
[680.44 - 683.08] P:1659.48 E:0.089826 |  that's taken down by Huber McCarno,
[683.12 - 684.48] P:1837.89 E:0.087200 |  he knocks it forward, he has,
[684.48 - 687.68] P:1781.42 E:0.105919 |  Griezmann's not really got into the game just yet,
[687.68 - 691.00] P:1825.30 E:0.105285 |  and there's a foul on Mbappe,
[691.00 - 693.40] P:1770.22 E:0.100909 |  and it's a free kick to France over on the far side,
[693.40 - 696.44] P:1838.44 E:0.093990 |  I mentioned the fact that the Forest Green-Alva Church matches
[696.44 - 698.92] P:1668.80 E:0.102807 |  is going on on Sport Extra, the commentary,
[698.92 - 701.08] P:1737.50 E:0.097884 |  more news from there, with Chris Coles.
[701.08 - 703.60] P:1835.88 E:0.107161 |  An equaliser for the non-League side, John,
[703.60 - 705.64] P:1952.48 E:0.102697 |  Forest Green-1, Alva Church-1,
[705.64 - 709.72] P:1845.38 E:0.099788 |  Jed Abbey with a sumptuous free kick from the edge of the area over the wall,
[709.72 - 710.92] P:1905.48 E:0.087656 |  into the top corner,
[710.96 - 714.24] P:1884.13 E:0.094515 |  and the lowest ranked team left in the FA Cup are still alive.
[714.24 - 717.52] P:1765.87 E:0.092694 |  Forest Green-1, Alva Church-1, five minutes into the second half.
[717.92 - 719.84] P:1741.83 E:0.103979 |  Griezmann with this free kick for France,
[719.84 - 721.16] P:1578.37 E:0.124643 |  that's a good delivery as well,
[721.16 - 723.04] P:1711.04 E:0.083389 |  and it's come off the head of the defender,
[723.04 - 726.20] P:1690.84 E:0.097714 |  who just came across it and got a glancing head,
[726.20 - 728.36] P:1760.37 E:0.093178 |  it was Cornelius actually, the centre-forward,
[728.36 - 730.72] P:1647.08 E:0.105865 |  who actually headed it across his own penalty area,
[730.72 - 732.64] P:1426.07 E:0.092901 |  you had to get that right, but he did out for corner.
[732.64 - 734.28] P:1628.33 E:0.075491 |  There's a good ball in,
[734.28 - 736.04] P:1855.07 E:0.124280 |  Giri was lurking there, didn't he?
[736.04 - 737.92] P:1814.57 E:0.089920 |  Stretching his neck out there,
[737.92 - 739.96] P:1880.93 E:0.108669 |  the expectation that ball was going to get to him,
[739.96 - 743.20] P:1864.70 E:0.096488 |  so Cornelius had to get something on it, and luckily he did,
[743.20 - 744.64] P:1758.51 E:0.098445 |  but he's given away a corner.
[744.64 - 747.92] P:1586.00 E:0.098359 |  Well, if France continue to put balls into the Danish box like this,
[747.92 - 749.64] P:1432.26 E:0.106381 |  as they have done in the opening 12 minutes,
[749.64 - 752.16] P:1555.72 E:0.096628 |  this is going to be a severe test for the Danish defence.
[752.96 - 754.92] P:1751.39 E:0.114824 |  Corner then from the right, first corner of the match,
[754.92 - 759.04] P:1763.92 E:0.084886 |  Griezmann to take it, left for it, to the edge of the six yard box,
[759.04 - 760.96] P:1723.69 E:0.111311 |  glanced right across the face of goal,
[760.96 - 763.40] P:1570.02 E:0.090885 |  and then scrambled away at the back post,
[763.40 - 766.28] P:1725.49 E:0.092847 |  the number of players went for it at the near post,
[766.28 - 768.88] P:1656.68 E:0.113609 |  it might have been Varan who was closest to it,
[768.92 - 773.28] P:1713.53 E:0.092415 |  let's see, as the ball is cleared away downfield to Loris at the other end,
[773.28 - 775.64] P:1564.19 E:0.092555 |  long, long clearance from him downfield,
[775.64 - 780.40] P:1606.89 E:0.087654 |  Dembele wins that header, in fact he's fouled his man, Nelson,
[780.40 - 783.48] P:1511.82 E:0.096557 |  Victor Nelson who's gone down holding his head, so the referee,
[783.48 - 784.96] P:1559.38 E:0.079520 |  who actually I haven't mentioned yet,
[784.96 - 791.60] P:1639.35 E:0.089719 |  Simon Marciniak is the referee, the Polish official, Champions League referee,
[791.60 - 795.24] P:1472.52 E:0.098664 |  as you'll be aware, it was Varan, wasn't it, who got that near post header?
[795.24 - 797.80] P:1738.56 E:0.089337 |  It was a fantastic leap, wasn't it, at that near post there,
[797.84 - 800.88] P:1697.50 E:0.095784 |  when Griezmann whips that corner in with great pace again,
[800.88 - 804.12] P:1682.84 E:0.091918 |  and he's first to react and get that, but luckily for Denmark,
[804.12 - 807.32] P:1747.45 E:0.089716 |  Maylor was there at the far post to get it away.
[807.84 - 812.04] P:1644.59 E:0.089455 |  Yes, just making a look at that, so Varan's header,
[812.04 - 815.96] P:1719.78 E:0.097948 |  that's the nearest we've come to an opening goal in this World Cup match,
[815.96 - 820.48] P:1728.13 E:0.085755 |  in Group D, where if France win, they'll be through to the last 16,
[820.48 - 824.68] P:1511.48 E:0.109522 |  we're going back to the new long though, in the FA Cup, Chris Coles.
[824.68 - 828.52] P:1902.50 E:0.104006 |  Because Alba Church's joy short lived, Forest Green back in front,
[828.52 - 831.60] P:1841.64 E:0.093235 |  they lead to one, Josh March, stooping header at the back post,
[831.60 - 835.52] P:1834.10 E:0.090863 |  formerly of Alba Church, and he's put Forest Green two on up against Alba Church.
[836.08 - 838.08] P:1594.76 E:0.108043 |  The commentary continues on Sports Extra,
[838.08 - 842.48] P:1626.92 E:0.095953 |  and we will keep you updated on any big stories in the FA Cup,
[842.48 - 846.28] P:1499.16 E:0.093258 |  second round, I should have asked, I presume the draw for the third round
[846.28 - 850.92] P:1536.29 E:0.101945 |  is Monday night, it normally is, and Juliette to my left is giving me the thumbs up.
[851.88 - 856.36] P:1626.67 E:0.103615 |  Mark Chapman can't surely be going back for the third round draw, can he, from Catalan?
[856.36 - 860.20] P:1791.18 E:0.105808 |  Although you never know, dear, I'm convinced sometimes that there's at least three of him.
[861.00 - 866.40] P:1539.58 E:0.095309 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill, Upa Mccano playing the ball away from the edge of his own penalty area,
[866.40 - 872.08] P:1715.71 E:0.090618 |  out to tail Hernandez, gets his head down, crosses the halfway line, looks to his left,
[872.08 - 876.28] P:1615.39 E:0.101636 |  and he's hugging the white line over there, Kylian Mbappe takes on Christensen,
[876.28 - 880.40] P:1559.97 E:0.086304 |  and then Mbappe decides just to knock it back into centre field,
[880.96 - 885.20] P:1611.62 E:0.088762 |  to Tua Mene, and Tua Mene's back in possession this time,
[885.20 - 889.40] P:1674.76 E:0.095740 |  and Mbappe more central, he goes for a well-struck, sweetly-struck pass,
[889.40 - 891.76] P:1385.78 E:0.107995 |  out to the right-hand side, Dembele taking on Mille,
[891.76 - 895.28] P:1710.55 E:0.096468 |  I just can't quite get past him, thought he had, then turns, Christ turn,
[895.28 - 899.84] P:1774.31 E:0.111088 |  and then a right foot across, that's a good one in the middle, Giroud battling for it.
[899.84 - 903.52] P:1763.29 E:0.102188 |  Defender was there with him, and the two of them just have a little tangle actually after that,
[903.52 - 909.56] P:1724.63 E:0.083208 |  Jochim Anderson of Crystal Palace, and I think the Giroud just sort of,
[909.60 - 913.32] P:1575.21 E:0.106666 |  there was a brief interaction between the two of them, and then Giroud just walked away.
[913.32 - 917.60] P:1578.30 E:0.100457 |  That's exactly what Giroud needs, is Dembele to get that ball,
[917.60 - 922.08] P:1740.38 E:0.095175 |  and go past the fullback, or the wing, left wingback as he did Mille,
[922.08 - 927.04] P:1725.63 E:0.098116 |  and whip that ball in with pace, and 1v1, but he thwarted him again just,
[927.04 - 928.68] P:1559.88 E:0.096152 |  and he wasn't too happy with the defender.
[928.68 - 931.04] P:1606.91 E:0.100332 |  Alan, you must be twitching sitting here as the centre forward.
[931.04 - 934.08] P:1765.10 E:0.111090 |  Did you not see me jump, and Jo? I was on the end of that one.
[934.08 - 936.92] P:1511.36 E:0.097142 |  Watching some of these crosses that are coming into the penalty area,
[936.92 - 938.76] P:1578.22 E:0.089082 |  you would have been in your element.
[938.80 - 942.84] P:1738.38 E:0.106248 |  I'll apologise now for using my elbows. I was after that one straight away.
[942.84 - 947.36] P:1667.75 E:0.083363 |  I know, I might have to have a concussion stoppage in the commentary box.
[947.36 - 951.32] P:1570.84 E:0.076449 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill.
[951.32 - 956.28] P:1485.19 E:0.097293 |  Just watching there, Jochim Anderson incidentally, just took me back to the Premier League
[956.28 - 960.24] P:1540.83 E:0.094834 |  at the start of this season when Darwin Nunez ended up getting sent off,
[960.24 - 965.04] P:1550.36 E:0.087882 |  when Jochim Anderson wound him up at Anfield, didn't he?
[965.04 - 965.92] P:1855.68 E:0.100172 |  Just trying to do the same.
[965.92 - 967.64] P:1359.61 E:0.116066 |  Well, I just wonder whether he might be.
[967.64 - 970.76] P:1428.82 E:0.105275 |  I mean, good luck with that against Olivier Giroud with all of his experience.
[970.76 - 973.00] P:1711.85 E:0.096455 |  I was just about to say that he won't fall for that, will he?
[973.00 - 975.04] P:1550.11 E:0.057641 |  You wouldn't have thought so.
[975.04 - 981.08] P:1650.25 E:0.078782 |  Particularly, well, who knows, but the heat can do funny things to people, you know.
[981.08 - 985.96] P:1550.32 E:0.088863 |  The ball's out of play on the halfway line, and it's a throwing to France.
[985.96 - 989.96] P:1357.46 E:0.098957 |  And it is, I would say, about four-fifths full of stadium.
[989.96 - 991.84] P:1327.41 E:0.088553 |  That would be my guess.
[991.84 - 994.44] P:1477.50 E:0.105517 |  The French in great voice, that's who you can hear at the moment,
[994.48 - 996.00] P:1601.65 E:0.078213 |  the French supporters.
[996.00 - 1000.16] P:1465.61 E:0.105565 |  And Giroud just laying the ball off to the right-hand side, looking for Kunde,
[1000.16 - 1002.60] P:1467.24 E:0.102370 |  but he's been caught up field, although he's helped out by Veran,
[1002.60 - 1004.32] P:1676.81 E:0.070197 |  who comes and chips it forward.
[1004.32 - 1007.40] P:1489.39 E:0.087942 |  And Denmark have got it again at the back,
[1007.40 - 1010.48] P:1643.88 E:0.088831 |  and they go back into their own territory.
[1010.48 - 1014.12] P:1540.87 E:0.098052 |  So it is Kasper Schmeichel with the ball at his feet.
[1014.12 - 1017.64] P:1649.56 E:0.099054 |  I noticed the television cameras were zooming in on him
[1017.64 - 1021.80] P:1689.23 E:0.093688 |  when he was carrying out his warm-up, and he was dressed in that black shirt
[1021.80 - 1023.80] P:1622.17 E:0.090184 |  that Denmark are wearing.
[1023.80 - 1027.36] P:1665.64 E:0.083111 |  You can't see any of the logos from the sponsors,
[1027.36 - 1032.76] P:1575.17 E:0.088471 |  which was part of the whole thing against the human rights in Qatar.
[1032.76 - 1037.04] P:1653.21 E:0.081053 |  But wearing black in these conditions, he was absolutely sweltered.
[1037.04 - 1040.00] P:1590.18 E:0.083911 |  You could tell the sweat was dripping off him.
[1040.00 - 1041.44] P:1554.08 E:0.083382 |  Kasper Schmeichel.
[1041.44 - 1044.40] P:1571.65 E:0.100714 |  Denmark bringing the ball forward towards the halfway line,
[1044.40 - 1048.08] P:1646.15 E:0.096628 |  and Nelson just pops it across to Andreas Christensen.
[1048.08 - 1050.64] P:1607.33 E:0.098185 |  It's a little bit of a rejig at the back for Denmark,
[1050.64 - 1053.56] P:1647.87 E:0.093964 |  with Nelson coming in on the left side of the back three.
[1053.56 - 1057.00] P:1614.32 E:0.091468 |  So Christensen has moved across to the right, the former Chelsea man.
[1057.00 - 1062.00] P:1535.29 E:0.085185 |  Now Barcelona and Denmark go all the way back to Schmeichel again,
[1062.00 - 1064.28] P:1469.99 E:0.088637 |  who plays it out to the right-hand side.
[1064.28 - 1066.12] P:1736.55 E:0.082493 |  Christensen knocks it into the middle.
[1066.12 - 1068.36] P:1684.68 E:0.098254 |  Cornelius trying to hold it up,
[1068.36 - 1070.92] P:1620.71 E:0.084584 |  but France have been able to win the ball back from him,
[1070.92 - 1073.72] P:1548.55 E:0.069538 |  and they've got it inside their own half.
[1073.72 - 1079.44] P:1613.97 E:0.077721 |  Here is Veran, world cup winner, multiple Champions League winner.
[1079.44 - 1081.76] P:1706.45 E:0.090129 |  And France with them back there.
[1081.76 - 1084.48] P:1625.88 E:0.110311 |  And now Hernandez is carrying it forward, the left back,
[1084.48 - 1088.60] P:1704.67 E:0.081097 |  but his pass was behind Giroud, and Denmark have got it back.
[1088.60 - 1090.96] P:1520.87 E:0.090763 |  And it is the day in so come forward, Christian Eriksson,
[1090.96 - 1093.40] P:1653.05 E:0.073625 |  just knocking it back to Meila.
[1093.40 - 1095.00] P:1417.58 E:0.080335 |  And this time it's Denmark,
[1095.00 - 1097.44] P:1573.04 E:0.088409 |  who have possession inside their own half.
[1097.44 - 1102.68] P:1655.85 E:0.081293 |  So there is Kasper Hulmand down there on the coaching area,
[1102.68 - 1106.08] P:1797.07 E:0.062790 |  short-sleeved white shirt,
[1106.12 - 1109.76] P:1560.42 E:0.092197 |  just watching his team coming forward towards the halfway line.
[1109.76 - 1114.16] P:1508.66 E:0.082941 |  Nelson uses Meila, and he's quickly closed down by Kunde,
[1114.16 - 1117.04] P:1676.58 E:0.085111 |  and then back again into the Danish half.
[1117.04 - 1122.52] P:1479.05 E:0.083089 |  I think the debate about whether it's Rabeo or Kunde right back
[1122.52 - 1126.04] P:1696.20 E:0.091856 |  has been an interesting one, that's what they've been talking about in France.
[1126.04 - 1128.56] P:1576.64 E:0.105619 |  And Meila is now taking it on, but it's actually Dembele,
[1128.56 - 1130.16] P:1733.03 E:0.097453 |  who comes back and puts the challenge in,
[1130.16 - 1133.96] P:1704.44 E:0.091533 |  almost in his own right back position, with Kunde backing away.
[1134.04 - 1138.20] P:1653.37 E:0.082500 |  Throw-in is taken quickly, played into the penalty area by Damsegaard.
[1138.20 - 1141.28] P:1727.20 E:0.093727 |  And then back and finds it to Damsegaard again on the stretch,
[1141.28 - 1144.28] P:1715.37 E:0.105518 |  got away from him, then stepped forward, and nipped it away,
[1144.28 - 1145.92] P:1638.64 E:0.107823 |  and then Griezmann passes it forward,
[1145.92 - 1148.28] P:1760.79 E:0.120402 |  and that Danish back line has got to be careful here.
[1148.28 - 1151.84] P:1740.57 E:0.113349 |  In fact, Mbappe was sprinting away, and he was pulled back.
[1151.84 - 1153.64] P:1566.43 E:0.116015 |  Now there were players either side of him,
[1153.64 - 1157.36] P:1809.09 E:0.109236 |  it was just forward of the centre circle, maybe three, four yards,
[1157.36 - 1160.20] P:1785.70 E:0.113545 |  but that was a blatant pull back by Andreas Christensen,
[1160.20 - 1163.44] P:1804.10 E:0.118795 |  who knew that Mbappe was away from him, and he pulled him over.
[1163.44 - 1166.72] P:1932.93 E:0.111181 |  He'd done him, he'd won the ball, he was away on goal.
[1166.72 - 1172.24] P:1958.66 E:0.107816 |  Luckily for him, there were probably two defenders in Anderson and Nelson,
[1172.24 - 1174.20] P:1990.47 E:0.115470 |  who were just within three or four yards,
[1174.20 - 1176.36] P:1882.61 E:0.106679 |  and perhaps would have got to the ball.
[1176.36 - 1179.04] P:1946.41 E:0.116678 |  But all the French players are surrounding their referee there,
[1179.04 - 1181.52] P:1969.76 E:0.093554 |  seeing that they think it should be a red card.
[1181.52 - 1184.48] P:2034.73 E:0.101049 |  I think these defenders have helped him out massively here,
[1184.48 - 1187.20] P:1940.86 E:0.110584 |  because they were within two or three yards of him.
[1187.20 - 1189.48] P:1918.70 E:0.096335 |  If there's no one there, it's without doubt a red.
[1189.48 - 1192.92] P:1782.58 E:0.090702 |  Yeah, it is a yellow, and you can hear the reaction
[1192.92 - 1195.24] P:1581.78 E:0.078078 |  of the French supporters, you can...
[1195.24 - 1198.04] P:1757.27 E:0.103253 |  Well, we're telling you what the reaction is of the French players.
[1198.04 - 1200.28] P:1731.80 E:0.087202 |  They were around referee Marciniak,
[1200.28 - 1204.16] P:1694.04 E:0.087977 |  but he is one of the best referees around in Europe,
[1204.16 - 1208.00] P:1678.44 E:0.092338 |  and it wouldn't be at all a surprise if he ended up refereeing
[1208.00 - 1212.72] P:1617.13 E:0.085183 |  the World Cup final itself, providing Poland don't go very, very deep
[1212.72 - 1214.12] P:1641.15 E:0.084251 |  into the tournament.
[1214.12 - 1217.24] P:1648.27 E:0.105899 |  But it is a free kick, and it's only a yellow card,
[1217.24 - 1218.72] P:1806.44 E:0.080426 |  first of the match to Christensen.
[1218.72 - 1220.72] P:1622.01 E:0.099156 |  He's got that one right, I think. I think so too.
[1220.76 - 1223.40] P:1723.33 E:0.114991 |  D'Ambelli left-footed ball into the air, and that's good as well!
[1223.40 - 1225.32] P:1834.27 E:0.097257 |  Smycon makes the save!
[1225.32 - 1227.60] P:1796.56 E:0.111125 |  The header from Rabiot, from what?
[1227.60 - 1231.68] P:1814.57 E:0.099533 |  12 yards out, 13 yards out, and he leapt to his right.
[1231.68 - 1233.68] P:1636.94 E:0.097073 |  Smycon was able to parry it away.
[1233.68 - 1235.64] P:1922.43 E:0.104854 |  It's clearly in their game plan, John France.
[1235.64 - 1237.24] P:1895.91 E:0.110808 |  We've seen it on the left-hand side now,
[1237.24 - 1239.08] P:1839.09 E:0.106866 |  and we've seen it twice on this right-hand side,
[1239.08 - 1241.16] P:1837.66 E:0.106836 |  with D'Ambelli whipping those balls in,
[1241.16 - 1243.36] P:1971.69 E:0.101693 |  and if it's not Giroud getting on the end,
[1243.36 - 1245.68] P:1861.29 E:0.102452 |  then it's either going to be Mbappe or Rabiot,
[1245.68 - 1247.76] P:1954.69 E:0.103037 |  as it was then, as it was in the first game.
[1247.76 - 1249.64] P:1982.11 E:0.093631 |  He's given the freedom to do that,
[1249.68 - 1251.68] P:1701.65 E:0.093519 |  and he didn't off-time his runs well.
[1251.68 - 1253.68] P:1602.84 E:0.087424 |  Well, if it carries on like this,
[1253.68 - 1256.60] P:1629.66 E:0.094704 |  and this quality of ball continues to be the case
[1256.60 - 1258.04] P:1493.17 E:0.097538 |  into the Danish penalty area,
[1258.04 - 1262.04] P:1804.20 E:0.089712 |  you would think that it's only a matter of time before Giroud
[1262.04 - 1264.68] P:1354.84 E:0.098809 |  or Rabiot, who's now had a couple of headers in there,
[1264.68 - 1269.96] P:1749.11 E:0.072350 |  actually is able to convert and get the ball into the Danish net,
[1269.96 - 1273.88] P:1719.67 E:0.085032 |  but there are no guarantees that that would be the case.
[1273.88 - 1276.40] P:1708.69 E:0.093377 |  Going back to Kunde, by the way, at the other end,
[1276.64 - 1280.08] P:1692.85 E:0.099580 |  Julian Laun was giving us a bit of insight, wasn't he,
[1280.08 - 1284.80] P:1705.30 E:0.088744 |  into how, when Kunde has played at right-back for France,
[1284.80 - 1289.00] P:1659.83 E:0.097739 |  things have not always, in fact, almost always, not gone well,
[1289.00 - 1290.80] P:1620.39 E:0.095620 |  and the last time he played at right-back,
[1290.80 - 1294.64] P:1731.96 E:0.094803 |  he was sent off against Bosnia and had a terrible match
[1294.64 - 1296.96] P:1677.41 E:0.098738 |  in that position, according to Julian.
[1296.96 - 1299.64] P:1602.90 E:0.086262 |  So we'll keep an eye on that as well.
[1299.64 - 1301.28] P:1529.04 E:0.098899 |  The FA Cup third round draw, by the way,
[1301.28 - 1303.16] P:1587.56 E:0.077536 |  it is 7 o'clock Monday night,
[1303.20 - 1306.40] P:1631.58 E:0.077480 |  and you'll hear it on 5 Live,
[1306.40 - 1310.40] P:1702.83 E:0.071369 |  and you can watch it on BBC Two Monday night.
[1310.40 - 1311.84] P:1660.65 E:0.072342 |  And when we get back,
[1311.84 - 1315.28] P:1547.19 E:0.090345 |  we'll be more or less going straight into the FA Cup third round, won't we?
[1315.28 - 1318.76] P:1736.85 E:0.089005 |  Seems like a long way from sitting here.
[1318.76 - 1320.96] P:1631.17 E:0.102291 |  No time off, John. We don't want that, do we?
[1320.96 - 1324.04] P:1580.66 E:0.065850 |  We never close. We're like Arkwright.
[1324.04 - 1325.88] P:1624.98 E:0.070881 |  France, Nill.
[1325.88 - 1327.64] P:1586.09 E:0.076437 |  Denmark, Nill.
[1327.64 - 1331.08] P:1615.59 E:0.084885 |  Halfway through the first half, and France have had the better of it,
[1331.08 - 1334.08] P:1651.94 E:0.084868 |  but haven't been able to find a way through.
[1336.28 - 1338.84] P:1721.59 E:0.100047 |  Denmark, with it on the halfway line.
[1338.84 - 1341.84] P:1677.88 E:0.103780 |  Giroud gets there first, and I think he was caught by Cornelius.
[1341.84 - 1343.28] P:1506.55 E:0.112887 |  He was, and that's a yellow card.
[1343.28 - 1345.00] P:1722.11 E:0.108508 |  The referee's seen that as a late challenge
[1345.00 - 1348.32] P:1660.57 E:0.099208 |  by the one centre forward on the other in the centre circle.
[1348.32 - 1353.24] P:1691.58 E:0.070712 |  Just stepped on his ankle, and actually, he's down.
[1353.24 - 1357.40] P:1781.18 E:0.082768 |  The big man, the experienced French centre forward,
[1357.40 - 1360.52] P:1490.43 E:0.078331 |  the number nine, Olivier Giroud.
[1360.56 - 1362.16] P:1326.82 E:0.118274 |  Cornelius leaning over him.
[1362.16 - 1363.96] P:1421.01 E:0.100491 |  Just checking to see he's all right,
[1363.96 - 1368.16] P:1546.62 E:0.078259 |  but that's his second Danish player in the referee's notebook.
[1368.16 - 1370.84] P:1631.92 E:0.098093 |  The problem that Denmark have got, John,
[1370.84 - 1374.68] P:1644.98 E:0.075188 |  is that because of the width that Mbappe and Dembele...
[1374.68 - 1376.08] P:1892.33 E:0.093508 |  He just stands on him there, doesn't he?
[1376.08 - 1379.44] P:1654.05 E:0.106079 |  Cornelius on the top of his foot and deserves a yellow card.
[1379.44 - 1380.28] P:986.29 E:0.107477 |  Nothing more than that.
[1380.28 - 1381.56] P:1412.10 E:0.104066 |  But I was saying, the problem they've got,
[1381.56 - 1384.24] P:1709.34 E:0.083533 |  is because of the width that France have got
[1384.24 - 1386.72] P:1819.25 E:0.097237 |  with Dembele and Mbappe left and right,
[1386.72 - 1388.96] P:1805.18 E:0.083987 |  they're not sure whether to go tight
[1388.96 - 1390.68] P:1604.04 E:0.107025 |  or whether to drop off.
[1390.68 - 1392.64] P:1758.28 E:0.102179 |  And what they've done at the minute is they're okay.
[1392.64 - 1394.40] P:1903.83 E:0.109176 |  You say, you're not going to get in behind us.
[1394.40 - 1395.48] P:1600.24 E:0.104166 |  We're actually going to drop off.
[1395.48 - 1398.84] P:1879.24 E:0.094857 |  So what both wingers or both forwards have done is they're okay.
[1398.84 - 1400.56] P:1829.68 E:0.087126 |  That's fine. We don't have to go past here.
[1400.56 - 1402.24] P:1737.59 E:0.083443 |  We're just going to whip that ball in.
[1402.24 - 1404.16] P:1736.49 E:0.116751 |  And if it's not Giroud, then it's going to be Rabiot,
[1404.16 - 1406.32] P:1818.61 E:0.079249 |  whose time in his run into the box.
[1406.32 - 1408.64] P:1666.33 E:0.109110 |  It's been a clear plan from France
[1408.64 - 1412.28] P:1659.33 E:0.075062 |  in these first 23 minutes, I think it is.
[1412.28 - 1415.60] P:1667.59 E:0.085422 |  That's Alan Shearer with us on Five Live.
[1415.64 - 1420.12] P:1494.69 E:0.099870 |  And remember, you can rewind the live radio on BBC Sounds
[1420.12 - 1422.64] P:1554.61 E:0.093793 |  or indeed on your smart speaker.
[1422.64 - 1424.16] P:1470.98 E:0.096705 |  If you've joined us late, you want to go back
[1424.16 - 1426.12] P:1679.90 E:0.078187 |  and listen to the whole commentary.
[1426.12 - 1428.12] P:1665.56 E:0.103137 |  All you need to do is just ask BBC Sounds
[1428.12 - 1430.52] P:1490.86 E:0.089965 |  to rewind to whatever time it was
[1430.52 - 1432.48] P:1555.43 E:0.093595 |  to go back to the start of our commentary.
[1432.48 - 1437.48] P:1435.41 E:0.088111 |  So ask BBC Sounds or the magic words on that.
[1437.64 - 1439.96] P:1614.11 E:0.092561 |  And you can take the World Cup with you
[1439.96 - 1444.12] P:1642.41 E:0.074408 |  throughout the course of the tournament via BBC Sounds.
[1444.16 - 1446.24] P:1653.87 E:0.094514 |  France Nill, Denmark Nill.
[1446.24 - 1449.16] P:1696.41 E:0.092968 |  24 minutes played. Giroud is okay.
[1449.16 - 1452.44] P:1524.11 E:0.090831 |  I think Cornelius just sort of stepped on the ball of his ankle,
[1452.44 - 1457.84] P:1685.04 E:0.075839 |  didn't he, which will be painful, but nothing too serious.
[1457.84 - 1460.04] P:1431.86 E:0.108078 |  You'll have a bruise. He might have a graze there,
[1460.04 - 1461.68] P:1756.83 E:0.064780 |  but he's back.
[1461.68 - 1464.84] P:1746.75 E:0.096152 |  I just see him as he's running there, just dragging that foot,
[1464.84 - 1466.08] P:1643.43 E:0.070093 |  but he's okay.
[1466.08 - 1467.84] P:1555.01 E:0.090909 |  France Nill, Denmark Nill.
[1467.84 - 1472.12] P:1779.60 E:0.076353 |  And Denmark bringing the ball out from the back
[1473.12 - 1476.76] P:1735.37 E:0.084336 |  and actually playing it back again into the back line.
[1476.76 - 1479.32] P:1727.13 E:0.097124 |  So this is the third commentary of the day.
[1479.32 - 1483.80] P:1572.10 E:0.084063 |  Big one tonight. Argentina, Mexico in Group C.
[1483.80 - 1489.68] P:1471.54 E:0.076454 |  And after Poland's win, that is a very, very interesting group.
[1489.68 - 1492.52] P:1599.04 E:0.078765 |  Denmark with it inside their own half.
[1492.52 - 1495.28] P:1676.49 E:0.089352 |  Long pass from Jocham Anderson,
[1495.28 - 1497.84] P:1492.83 E:0.094565 |  which is mis-controlled behind Baymeila,
[1497.84 - 1500.48] P:1713.49 E:0.072785 |  and that will be a goal kick to the French.
[1500.48 - 1502.20] P:1532.62 E:0.106739 |  They're in great spirits down there.
[1502.20 - 1505.92] P:1671.65 E:0.087862 |  Lots of trickleers being waved in their area.
[1505.92 - 1508.32] P:1643.31 E:0.081555 |  I've seen various members who've come straight
[1508.32 - 1510.60] P:1543.80 E:0.088932 |  from the French Revolution in the crowd.
[1510.60 - 1515.64] P:1550.31 E:0.076772 |  There are a whole line of them with their tricorn hats.
[1515.64 - 1518.48] P:1494.94 E:0.104770 |  We've got asterisks and obliques in there, as well, I noticed,
[1518.48 - 1520.40] P:1443.75 E:0.077231 |  towards the back of the stand.
[1520.40 - 1524.56] P:1701.94 E:0.087640 |  And France down in front of them, the current heroes,
[1524.56 - 1528.24] P:1649.13 E:0.071728 |  are going to take this goal kick.
[1528.24 - 1531.84] P:1768.96 E:0.075704 |  Almost indomitable in the World Cup.
[1531.84 - 1534.68] P:1499.99 E:0.093272 |  Already a 4-1 win, and they're playing the ball out
[1534.68 - 1536.72] P:1621.73 E:0.071176 |  towards the left-hand side.
[1536.72 - 1539.24] P:1709.61 E:0.082051 |  Obamacano to Hernandez.
[1539.24 - 1542.16] P:1605.59 E:0.075365 |  Hernandez being put under pressure,
[1542.16 - 1545.00] P:1616.36 E:0.086091 |  and France being forced back into their own penalty area.
[1545.00 - 1546.68] P:1640.45 E:0.094180 |  It's knocked across the six-yard box.
[1546.68 - 1547.96] P:1350.28 E:0.092107 |  There have been some anxious moments,
[1547.96 - 1550.40] P:1412.08 E:0.099841 |  as Tottenham have played out from the back with Lloris this season,
[1550.40 - 1552.36] P:1576.96 E:0.090553 |  and there, he just over-hit that pass.
[1552.36 - 1555.96] P:1721.29 E:0.091059 |  And Denmark are back in possession inside the French half,
[1556.08 - 1558.32] P:1750.97 E:0.083709 |  although they go back into their own territory.
[1558.32 - 1563.16] P:1622.65 E:0.071303 |  And it is played forward again by Joachim Andersen.
[1563.16 - 1564.96] P:1490.07 E:0.099343 |  He's right on the halfway line,
[1564.96 - 1568.40] P:1484.67 E:0.079317 |  and he passes it back to his right, to Christensen,
[1568.40 - 1571.92] P:1453.42 E:0.087196 |  and then Christensen, back to Joachim Andersen again.
[1571.92 - 1573.64] P:1580.42 E:0.091955 |  Not too much movement up ahead,
[1573.64 - 1575.88] P:1541.85 E:0.096317 |  so Joachim Andersen will take it on himself,
[1575.88 - 1578.44] P:1581.14 E:0.095749 |  and actually carry it halfway inside the French half.
[1578.44 - 1580.36] P:1606.57 E:0.072574 |  The ball then hits the referee.
[1580.36 - 1583.00] P:1395.50 E:0.091220 |  So we will have an uncontested drop ball.
[1583.00 - 1585.36] P:1635.32 E:0.079576 |  France-nil, Denmark-nil.
[1585.36 - 1588.56] P:1725.53 E:0.071973 |  We've attracted... Well, we say we've attracted, you've attracted.
[1588.56 - 1589.88] P:1496.07 E:0.084681 |  Quite a lot of attention, haven't you?
[1589.88 - 1594.00] P:1697.97 E:0.078354 |  I think that's an official FIFA cameraman who's been hovering around.
[1594.00 - 1595.76] P:1950.34 E:0.106430 |  It's you, John, they're after you.
[1595.76 - 1597.16] P:1431.49 E:0.040485 |  Yeah.
[1597.16 - 1600.08] P:1681.81 E:0.073867 |  They would be wanting the autograph for the minute.
[1600.08 - 1601.56] P:1658.27 E:0.058889 |  Fame at last.
[1601.56 - 1604.04] P:1540.34 E:0.083680 |  Here's Andersen, right for the ball,
[1604.04 - 1606.48] P:1714.37 E:0.097947 |  out to Mala, who had to jump for it,
[1606.48 - 1609.88] P:1741.19 E:0.085544 |  but that meant that he presented the ball to Kunde,
[1609.88 - 1612.44] P:1738.20 E:0.068925 |  who headed it out of play.
[1612.48 - 1615.36] P:1584.33 E:0.090103 |  Mala will take this, 10 yards back from the corner flag,
[1615.36 - 1617.40] P:1607.00 E:0.084336 |  gets it down, just taps it in field,
[1617.40 - 1619.12] P:1624.30 E:0.099182 |  but Kunde was able to get it away.
[1619.12 - 1622.00] P:1559.85 E:0.090739 |  However, the central defender, Nelson, got involved.
[1622.00 - 1626.24] P:1651.88 E:0.078682 |  Nelson, Nelson against the French, that's only just a curtain.
[1626.24 - 1630.04] P:1782.88 E:0.075216 |  It could be his Trafalgar tonight.
[1630.04 - 1634.48] P:1819.82 E:0.075174 |  Here is Hoibier, back to the halfway line,
[1634.48 - 1636.36] P:1773.25 E:0.084060 |  and now Andreas Christensen,
[1636.36 - 1639.00] P:1575.77 E:0.100281 |  Christensen right for the ball to the edge of the penalty area.
[1639.04 - 1643.16] P:1525.44 E:0.084563 |  That's up and headed away by Hernandez out of play on the far side.
[1643.16 - 1646.88] P:1559.12 E:0.089761 |  It was an awful blow, wasn't it, for Lucas Hernandez,
[1646.88 - 1650.36] P:1510.72 E:0.092623 |  with some of the injury problems that he's had to be taken out of the world,
[1650.36 - 1652.28] P:1563.28 E:0.093145 |  cut with a knee injury in the opening match.
[1652.28 - 1656.12] P:1542.41 E:0.093653 |  But his brother steps in, Denmark with it on the right-hand side.
[1656.12 - 1659.72] P:1692.03 E:0.100988 |  Attempted cross, that's blocked out of play by young Hernandez,
[1659.72 - 1664.08] P:1629.01 E:0.093348 |  and it's another corner, and the Danish fans are quite cheered by this.
[1664.08 - 1666.24] P:1573.04 E:0.079627 |  So it's a throwing to Denmark.
[1666.32 - 1668.60] P:1687.45 E:0.096654 |  Ericsson comes short, Christian Ericsson,
[1668.60 - 1670.72] P:1794.50 E:0.080541 |  just a light touch with his right foot,
[1670.72 - 1674.52] P:1708.47 E:0.094146 |  and then Ericsson gets it back again, but I think he might have overrun it.
[1674.52 - 1676.48] P:1751.66 E:0.089914 |  He has, it's a goal kick to the French.
[1676.48 - 1678.52] P:1856.20 E:0.113105 |  And that's what they're trying to do, is Denmark,
[1678.52 - 1681.36] P:1880.50 E:0.102829 |  is trying to stretch the play as well with their two wingbacks
[1681.36 - 1685.12] P:1777.83 E:0.110146 |  when they get the ball and look for that long diagonal pass
[1685.12 - 1687.84] P:1798.43 E:0.070059 |  from one of the three centre halves.
[1687.84 - 1691.16] P:1646.01 E:0.088396 |  So, goal kick, and I think Larisse is going to take this long, yes.
[1691.16 - 1694.80] P:1704.40 E:0.079781 |  There's going to be no more of that faffing about with it,
[1694.84 - 1698.36] P:1704.61 E:0.099915 |  after the latest mini-scare, so he'll take it long.
[1698.36 - 1701.24] P:1793.92 E:0.100544 |  Faffing about, John, that's called playing out on the backs.
[1701.24 - 1705.32] P:1616.54 E:0.072904 |  That's what I meant to say.
[1705.32 - 1708.56] P:1658.85 E:0.096039 |  I know a lot of people who think it's faffing about with the back.
[1708.56 - 1710.44] P:1651.58 E:0.094145 |  And one of them sometimes.
[1710.44 - 1714.84] P:1734.97 E:0.098097 |  Yeah, there's a long ball downfield towards Giroud,
[1714.84 - 1718.64] P:1567.87 E:0.082561 |  but he's beaten, in fact, and Bapé on the edge of the penalty area
[1718.64 - 1722.68] P:1538.07 E:0.084658 |  is beaten in the air by Anderson, and Denmark have got it back.
[1722.72 - 1724.68] P:1534.71 E:0.101522 |  And the thing is, as well, we're talking about the FA Cup
[1724.68 - 1727.60] P:1554.58 E:0.086279 |  second round this afternoon, they'll all be doing it, won't they?
[1727.60 - 1730.12] P:1521.09 E:0.097721 |  Down, you know, the non-league teams against the league teams
[1730.12 - 1732.24] P:1692.46 E:0.089299 |  will be playing it out from the back.
[1732.24 - 1733.80] P:1727.42 E:0.099996 |  Taking short goal kick.
[1733.80 - 1736.20] P:1696.19 E:0.113146 |  As Denmark continue to bring it forward,
[1736.20 - 1738.12] P:1443.76 E:0.106132 |  and Hernandez has to go up on the corner,
[1738.12 - 1741.16] P:1818.89 E:0.092958 |  has to go to ground to slide it out for a throw.
[1741.16 - 1742.80] P:1581.86 E:0.099176 |  Denmark just having a better spell.
[1742.80 - 1746.32] P:1795.67 E:0.078477 |  They've weathered quite a storm, actually, from France,
[1746.32 - 1748.92] P:1538.48 E:0.100802 |  and it's still 0-0, and now here they are,
[1748.92 - 1751.16] P:1705.65 E:0.109489 |  twist on the right-hand side from Lindstrom,
[1751.16 - 1754.40] P:1778.97 E:0.093357 |  who goes for the byline, but overruns it, French cheers,
[1754.40 - 1759.40] P:1667.31 E:0.083462 |  and it's behind for a goal kick to Didier Deschamps' side again.
[1759.40 - 1761.56] P:1563.56 E:0.111492 |  It's really good to have Endon from Hernandez,
[1761.56 - 1764.20] P:1713.05 E:0.102701 |  they just get his body in the way and guides that ball,
[1764.20 - 1768.32] P:1798.86 E:0.080739 |  lets that ball run out for a goal kick for France.
[1769.44 - 1773.36] P:1727.02 E:0.081630 |  So, Lloris will take this, not seen Didier Deschamps on the edge
[1773.36 - 1778.56] P:1730.11 E:0.078707 |  of his coaching area yet, one of the most glittering careers.
[1778.56 - 1781.08] P:1682.73 E:0.092176 |  It's possible to have the old water carrier,
[1781.12 - 1784.16] P:1520.41 E:0.103786 |  as Eric Cantona used to call him in his playing days,
[1784.16 - 1788.32] P:1763.30 E:0.091316 |  but brilliant record as captain of France, World Cup winners,
[1788.32 - 1792.24] P:1838.35 E:0.100873 |  some European Championship winners, and here it comes,
[1792.24 - 1795.84] P:1806.90 E:0.116781 |  and Bappe, and Bappe, brilliant turn, left-footed cross,
[1795.84 - 1797.64] P:1694.74 E:0.113513 |  it's gone all the way to the right-hand side,
[1797.64 - 1800.00] P:1744.31 E:0.108085 |  where it's driven across by Kunde,
[1800.00 - 1802.40] P:1861.79 E:0.102884 |  and it hits a defender in the middle,
[1802.40 - 1803.96] P:1862.36 E:0.119543 |  which took all the pace off it,
[1803.96 - 1807.24] P:1790.04 E:0.099508 |  there was Haibir in there on the edge of his six-yard box,
[1807.24 - 1810.12] P:1637.99 E:0.097935 |  and Schmeichel was able to rather easily just
[1810.16 - 1812.08] P:1734.08 E:0.073871 |  shot across to his left and pick it up.
[1812.08 - 1814.96] P:1752.83 E:0.106784 |  It's impossible to play against when he's got that much grass
[1814.96 - 1817.28] P:1774.30 E:0.113942 |  in behind him for a defender, because what he does is,
[1817.28 - 1820.16] P:1939.02 E:0.098215 |  and Bappe actually stops the defender, then he goes again,
[1820.16 - 1822.16] P:2000.74 E:0.103778 |  and as soon as the defender stops, he's away,
[1822.16 - 1823.48] P:1848.73 E:0.099268 |  and he gets in behind him.
[1823.48 - 1825.76] P:2025.23 E:0.110025 |  On this occasion, his final ball actually led him down,
[1825.76 - 1828.12] P:1940.44 E:0.102806 |  because he was meant to whip it in there for Giroud,
[1828.12 - 1832.04] P:1978.91 E:0.098022 |  who was in there, but it was actually Kunde who gets up to support him,
[1832.04 - 1833.48] P:2114.19 E:0.106491 |  and he gets his shot away at goal.
[1833.48 - 1836.00] P:1732.48 E:0.084971 |  It was on target, I think, but it was blocked.
[1836.04 - 1837.92] P:1669.52 E:0.059524 |  Yep, by Haibir.
[1837.92 - 1840.52] P:1606.50 E:0.076880 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill.
[1840.52 - 1843.24] P:1506.99 E:0.099887 |  At halftime, we'll round everything up for you,
[1843.24 - 1846.56] P:1759.56 E:0.087674 |  the latest on Wales, Australia coming as well,
[1846.56 - 1850.40] P:1727.37 E:0.092329 |  and they'll be gathering at Twickenham for England, South Africa.
[1850.40 - 1852.56] P:1781.52 E:0.091390 |  The ball is played behind Dembele,
[1852.56 - 1856.40] P:1775.80 E:0.064786 |  and it's out of play, and it's a throw in to Denmark.
[1856.40 - 1860.08] P:1783.99 E:0.071684 |  And Nelson just knocks it in field.
[1862.08 - 1865.84] P:1733.41 E:0.082980 |  And now it's being carried forward from centrefield by Haibir.
[1865.84 - 1867.88] P:1276.59 E:0.095021 |  They're messing with my mind, Denmark,
[1867.88 - 1869.60] P:1442.30 E:0.093756 |  because last time I sat in this seat,
[1869.60 - 1871.76] P:1441.04 E:0.097549 |  I was commentating in this ground on Poland,
[1871.76 - 1875.24] P:1727.93 E:0.084900 |  who were wearing white shirts, red shorts and white socks.
[1875.24 - 1877.72] P:1565.18 E:0.103154 |  So I'm going to say it now to try and stop myself
[1877.72 - 1880.20] P:1543.76 E:0.066348 |  saying Poland instead of Denmark,
[1880.20 - 1885.24] P:1543.78 E:0.077628 |  as Nelson plays the ball from the left-hand side,
[1885.24 - 1889.80] P:1760.27 E:0.095777 |  and Christensen rolls it down into the full-back position for Lindstrom,
[1889.80 - 1894.36] P:1751.59 E:0.100322 |  and then up on McConaugh comes across and has been able to play it back,
[1894.36 - 1899.96] P:1784.49 E:0.098178 |  according to the Polish officials, into the Danish player,
[1899.96 - 1903.52] P:1967.57 E:0.104783 |  and out of play.
[1903.52 - 1905.92] P:1874.87 E:0.108604 |  Not for me, I thought that was a corner.
[1905.92 - 1909.72] P:1605.68 E:0.087088 |  Lindstrom was making the point that the officials have given it,
[1909.72 - 1911.80] P:1683.41 E:0.093525 |  and it is given as a goal kick to France.
[1911.80 - 1913.64] P:1965.19 E:0.109501 |  What they've done differently though is,
[1913.64 - 1916.92] P:1944.37 E:0.107202 |  is Damsegold on this left-hand side, he was rather isolated,
[1916.92 - 1920.20] P:2104.46 E:0.103439 |  so what he's done is, he's actually made one or two runs in behind
[1920.20 - 1923.20] P:1707.51 E:0.104196 |  to try and support the big man Cornelius up there,
[1923.20 - 1927.44] P:1831.46 E:0.082706 |  and in doing that, he's asking the two centre-halves a different question.
[1927.44 - 1929.04] P:1473.52 E:0.098734 |  There was quite a lot of excitement, wasn't there,
[1929.04 - 1931.76] P:1647.42 E:0.086480 |  when Brenford signed Damsegold this summer,
[1931.76 - 1935.80] P:1728.11 E:0.089641 |  it was quite late in the transfer window after Ericsson had moved to Manchester United,
[1935.80 - 1940.20] P:1541.44 E:0.091207 |  but he's not really been a regular starter by any means,
[1940.20 - 1943.92] P:1758.86 E:0.087145 |  just three starts so far for Denmark, for Brenford,
[1943.92 - 1946.84] P:1789.77 E:0.084263 |  and eight substitute appearances,
[1946.84 - 1950.52] P:1637.38 E:0.099896 |  but he's very much a rising star, 22 years old,
[1950.56 - 1952.96] P:1738.50 E:0.074580 |  signed from Sampdoria this summer,
[1952.96 - 1956.44] P:1700.45 E:0.093611 |  and I'm sure in times to come for Thomas Frankside,
[1956.44 - 1959.36] P:1699.72 E:0.095931 |  he will get himself into the starting line-up,
[1959.36 - 1963.32] P:1666.07 E:0.086035 |  as Denmark have it at the back, Anderson,
[1963.32 - 1965.40] P:1756.21 E:0.101981 |  Christensen plays it away,
[1965.40 - 1968.68] P:1746.50 E:0.107076 |  and then it's up towards Cornelius, who goes down under the challenge,
[1968.68 - 1971.32] P:1844.84 E:0.105491 |  Denmark wanted a free kick, Griezmann takes it on,
[1971.32 - 1974.24] P:1750.89 E:0.116472 |  Giroud back to Griezmann, Griezmann shoots from an angle,
[1974.24 - 1975.84] P:1727.26 E:0.100231 |  saved by the goalkeeper's legs,
[1975.84 - 1978.16] P:1727.70 E:0.111806 |  Dempallet rolls it across, Turemene with a shot,
[1978.16 - 1980.12] P:1856.07 E:0.105940 |  Turemene then heads it's spread,
[1980.12 - 1982.28] P:1759.71 E:0.103078 |  Dempallet who shot his block,
[1982.28 - 1987.40] P:1781.31 E:0.101073 |  and they managed Denmark to get any number of defenders back in the penalty area there,
[1987.40 - 1990.08] P:1779.35 E:0.074372 |  when it threatened to open up for Franz,
[1990.08 - 1992.60] P:1525.17 E:0.092561 |  and somehow we're able to put the blocks in,
[1992.60 - 1995.36] P:1728.83 E:0.098193 |  we saw that save, strange save actually by Schmeichel,
[1995.36 - 1998.20] P:1595.84 E:0.093529 |  from the shot from an impossible angle by Griezmann,
[1998.20 - 2000.44] P:1736.40 E:0.076671 |  from almost on the dead ball line,
[2000.44 - 2003.32] P:1864.54 E:0.072604 |  but he kicked it away, Schmeichel,
[2003.32 - 2006.76] P:1698.88 E:0.092730 |  and that led to the harem scare him in the penalty area,
[2006.76 - 2009.28] P:1846.68 E:0.100569 |  Dempallet now playing it to Kunde,
[2009.32 - 2011.40] P:1799.17 E:0.105711 |  chance for him to cross to the back post,
[2011.40 - 2012.92] P:1725.99 E:0.102300 |  it's headed away by Christensen,
[2012.92 - 2016.52] P:1859.13 E:0.083186 |  and then cleared further away by Lindstrom,
[2016.52 - 2018.08] P:1490.58 E:0.101683 |  who is back inside his own penalty area,
[2018.08 - 2020.32] P:1836.73 E:0.091758 |  comes back again, Franz have stepped it up,
[2020.32 - 2022.60] P:1609.61 E:0.104521 |  Rabiot with a shot, that's into the back of Christensen,
[2022.60 - 2025.96] P:1672.77 E:0.102386 |  and it was hit with such force that the ball rebounded off Christensen,
[2025.96 - 2027.20] P:1691.42 E:0.120852 |  and actually didn't come down,
[2027.20 - 2029.80] P:1844.80 E:0.106472 |  but it dropped off the pitch on the far side.
[2029.80 - 2033.24] P:1851.22 E:0.112376 |  That's twice by the way, he's had to defend really, really well there,
[2033.24 - 2037.20] P:1882.55 E:0.109447 |  Christensen because the ball was dinked in from Kunde down this right-hand side,
[2037.60 - 2042.08] P:1788.47 E:0.106278 |  and Bapier was just about to try and stick his head on the end of it,
[2042.08 - 2043.44] P:1654.27 E:0.111795 |  and luckily the defender got there,
[2043.44 - 2045.32] P:1856.27 E:0.104504 |  and then he got up again and blocked another shot.
[2045.32 - 2048.24] P:1510.51 E:0.102082 |  Yeah, Griezmann plays the ball in from the left-hand side,
[2048.24 - 2050.24] P:1659.57 E:0.107698 |  Cornelius, that looked like a foul, it is,
[2050.24 - 2052.52] P:1770.15 E:0.099479 |  giving us a free kick, Cornelius,
[2052.52 - 2055.24] P:1744.19 E:0.096224 |  who is already on a yellow card, remember,
[2055.24 - 2057.36] P:1727.50 E:0.105253 |  for that foul on Giroud in the centre-circle,
[2057.36 - 2059.00] P:1763.21 E:0.098250 |  this time he's caught Tiuimene,
[2059.00 - 2062.80] P:1659.11 E:0.078586 |  this is between the centre-circle and the penalty area,
[2062.80 - 2066.96] P:1707.20 E:0.070915 |  and Tiuimene has stayed down,
[2067.00 - 2071.92] P:1693.55 E:0.087588 |  and Cornelius has kind of skulked away with his head bowed,
[2071.92 - 2073.76] P:1597.57 E:0.084513 |  I'm ever, ever so sorry,
[2073.76 - 2077.00] P:1708.72 E:0.094210 |  and he's in the referee Marchiniak,
[2077.00 - 2079.20] P:1459.38 E:0.095135 |  I think might just have a little word when he walks past him,
[2079.20 - 2080.96] P:1585.41 E:0.094448 |  but it's a free kick and a good position for France,
[2080.96 - 2083.12] P:1594.29 E:0.089654 |  another chance to put in one of those deliveries.
[2083.12 - 2085.28] P:1711.72 E:0.080338 |  Yeah, I'm sure that's what they're going to do,
[2085.28 - 2087.28] P:1767.40 E:0.088707 |  centre-off is up at the far post,
[2088.44 - 2089.96] P:1739.51 E:0.092447 |  one either side actually.
[2090.76 - 2094.40] P:1694.35 E:0.095112 |  Still no nail, Griezmann is over the ball,
[2095.36 - 2097.20] P:1671.13 E:0.116165 |  with the McCannos standing just behind him,
[2097.20 - 2099.80] P:1728.97 E:0.102569 |  but it is going to be Griezmann to play it in,
[2099.80 - 2101.80] P:1580.64 E:0.090212 |  and it's headed away by Anderson,
[2102.44 - 2104.80] P:1649.97 E:0.101477 |  it was rather casually played in, wasn't it,
[2104.80 - 2109.92] P:1706.43 E:0.086588 |  left-footed by Griezmann, he sort of swamped it up and curled it in,
[2109.92 - 2112.48] P:1791.21 E:0.085334 |  back with Griezmann again, playing it through the middle,
[2112.48 - 2115.04] P:1734.46 E:0.106223 |  bounces off and bat eight, Denmark come forward,
[2115.04 - 2117.56] P:1697.59 E:0.109454 |  Cornelius plays it out to the right-hand side,
[2117.56 - 2119.32] P:1682.44 E:0.108702 |  Denmark could be on for the break here,
[2119.32 - 2121.88] P:1617.67 E:0.115989 |  Cornelius I think he was offside when it was played through,
[2121.92 - 2125.28] P:1775.45 E:0.110497 |  he shoots wide at the near post from the angle.
[2126.60 - 2128.20] P:1802.43 E:0.110853 |  Yeah, I think it was offside as well.
[2128.96 - 2132.12] P:1778.74 E:0.107185 |  Hoibier just delayed the pass too long, I thought.
[2132.12 - 2135.44] P:2035.88 E:0.106773 |  Cornelius makes his run, he plays a lovely one-two with him,
[2135.44 - 2137.36] P:1920.16 E:0.084232 |  and he's looking for it again,
[2137.36 - 2139.40] P:2018.20 E:0.114934 |  and then they're running behind, he's got no other option,
[2139.40 - 2142.28] P:1754.23 E:0.107986 |  but to have a pop-it goal, because there's no one in support of him.
[2143.24 - 2145.56] P:1651.28 E:0.094767 |  But I think he had, I think he just straight offside.
[2146.56 - 2151.40] P:1766.56 E:0.094417 |  So, France-Nil, Denmark-Nil here in Qatar,
[2151.40 - 2154.48] P:1474.71 E:0.097799 |  on the south side of Doha, next to Doha Harbour,
[2154.48 - 2157.60] P:1798.60 E:0.086625 |  so all the cruise ships are reaching an incredible sight, actually.
[2157.60 - 2159.88] P:1619.69 E:0.099554 |  They just came in on the eve of the tournament,
[2159.88 - 2163.12] P:1762.76 E:0.084598 |  the biggest cruise ships you could ever wish to see,
[2163.12 - 2167.20] P:1796.12 E:0.083804 |  five, six more of them all moored in there,
[2167.20 - 2168.80] P:1668.78 E:0.092734 |  and that's what many supporters are doing,
[2168.80 - 2171.28] P:1718.55 E:0.088023 |  are staying on those cruise ships.
[2171.28 - 2173.52] P:1666.47 E:0.096051 |  Ball on the left-hand side with France,
[2173.72 - 2175.96] P:1683.59 E:0.091232 |  France-Nil, Denmark-Nil on five-life.
[2175.96 - 2178.16] P:1615.13 E:0.096879 |  We're going to go back to Wales, Australia in a moment,
[2178.16 - 2179.72] P:1647.98 E:0.103531 |  in the rugby union, the autumn international,
[2179.72 - 2182.04] P:1775.97 E:0.087864 |  but France are coming forward to Omeny,
[2182.04 - 2185.92] P:1739.69 E:0.086474 |  and then Giroud just uses his instep to play it back,
[2185.92 - 2188.08] P:1687.12 E:0.099766 |  centrally, Van Rijn, now it's with Dembele,
[2188.08 - 2190.48] P:1661.72 E:0.096813 |  cutting in from the right turns, back onto his right foot,
[2190.48 - 2192.44] P:1691.85 E:0.085734 |  he loves a turn, doesn't he, Dembele?
[2192.44 - 2196.32] P:1691.88 E:0.095687 |  Again, turns onto his left foot, goes for a high pass to Mbappe,
[2196.32 - 2198.76] P:1734.25 E:0.117267 |  who volleys it across, Giroud with a head-up,
[2198.76 - 2201.24] P:1826.47 E:0.090054 |  headed it down and wide.
[2201.28 - 2203.88] P:1777.91 E:0.092264 |  He was under pressure from Nelson,
[2203.88 - 2206.16] P:1494.65 E:0.099574 |  got up well, but headed it, what, a yard wide?
[2206.16 - 2209.16] P:1649.33 E:0.101108 |  Wow, what great play from all three forwards,
[2209.16 - 2212.00] P:1856.50 E:0.098158 |  from Dembele, the cross over to Mbappe,
[2212.00 - 2214.68] P:2054.53 E:0.094536 |  who then has got the decision to make whether he takes a touch,
[2214.68 - 2216.28] P:1961.73 E:0.103096 |  or actually volleys it first time,
[2216.28 - 2218.40] P:2005.69 E:0.098693 |  of which he chose to do with that left foot,
[2218.40 - 2220.36] P:1951.76 E:0.103829 |  and the hope that Giroud was in there,
[2220.36 - 2222.20] P:1946.68 E:0.108615 |  he was, and trying to get on the end of it,
[2222.20 - 2224.92] P:1983.81 E:0.097957 |  he just doesn't get the connection that he wants, does he,
[2224.92 - 2226.88] P:1787.22 E:0.068720 |  and heads it wide.
[2226.88 - 2228.80] P:1405.69 E:0.081075 |  What about the volley from Mbappe?
[2228.80 - 2230.52] P:1677.98 E:0.080072 |  Not bad, was it?
[2230.52 - 2231.96] P:1849.42 E:0.053981 |  Oh!
[2231.96 - 2234.32] P:1519.90 E:0.088659 |  It was decanio-like, wasn't it?
[2234.32 - 2236.04] P:1558.99 E:0.083861 |  Do you remember the decanio-like?
[2236.04 - 2237.04] P:1610.39 E:0.094770 |  I do.
[2237.04 - 2238.04] P:1756.81 E:0.102552 |  The volley at goal, that this was...
[2238.04 - 2239.04] P:1619.46 E:0.107950 |  The far post, yeah.
[2239.04 - 2242.04] P:1681.46 E:0.080145 |  This was on the other side of the penalty area.
[2242.04 - 2244.04] P:1723.46 E:0.104981 |  If you're on match of the day tonight,
[2244.04 - 2246.96] P:1702.92 E:0.097409 |  well, you might be on match of the day tonight, for all I know, are you?
[2246.96 - 2248.96] P:1649.54 E:0.105098 |  I don't think we'll get back on the highlights, no.
[2248.96 - 2250.96] P:1832.23 E:0.094139 |  Not with your driving, anyway.
[2252.36 - 2256.08] P:1680.23 E:0.087108 |  I see, Pegas can't be Tuesdays on the way back, is it?
[2256.08 - 2258.48] P:1593.97 E:0.096956 |  Well, Steve Bowers just over to our right,
[2258.52 - 2261.00] P:1386.76 E:0.096720 |  and I know he's commentating for the highlights, which are on,
[2261.00 - 2264.28] P:1535.57 E:0.062078 |  I think, 10.30 tonight, I wrote down somewhere.
[2264.28 - 2269.00] P:1596.81 E:0.099474 |  But anyway, my point is, if you were, you'd have that in your highlights.
[2269.00 - 2270.92] P:1677.47 E:0.118236 |  Christensen, brilliant work from him,
[2270.92 - 2273.80] P:1622.11 E:0.103154 |  and then plays the ball right across the six-yard box,
[2273.80 - 2276.88] P:1739.64 E:0.100805 |  and he says, and he's waving his fist in the air,
[2276.88 - 2279.60] P:1803.76 E:0.097085 |  Christensen, St Cornelius, come on!
[2279.60 - 2282.32] P:1770.12 E:0.092003 |  I've just nutmegged Hernandez,
[2282.32 - 2285.44] P:1589.10 E:0.103789 |  and played a ball like that across the edge of the six-yard box,
[2285.44 - 2286.44] P:1663.56 E:0.105141 |  where were you?
[2286.44 - 2290.48] P:2089.65 E:0.103142 |  He's furious, and rightly so, because he does so well to get him behind,
[2290.48 - 2293.16] P:1953.48 E:0.104877 |  he sticks it through the defenders' legs, and then whips it across,
[2293.16 - 2296.60] P:2046.43 E:0.095220 |  and thinking, come on, just get on the end of it, it's seven yards out.
[2296.60 - 2299.56] P:2108.01 E:0.102299 |  Cornelius just stood still, no movement whatsoever.
[2299.56 - 2302.56] P:1804.85 E:0.097610 |  He's absolutely right to be having a right go at him.
[2303.40 - 2305.32] P:1595.17 E:0.050004 |  Make a note of that, because that was...
[2305.32 - 2309.00] P:1721.22 E:0.066963 |  That's as good as they've had, I would say, Denmark.
[2309.00 - 2312.72] P:1759.68 E:0.083920 |  France nil, Denmark nil, half-time approaching,
[2313.00 - 2316.16] P:1793.56 E:0.093733 |  and as promised, the latest from Cardiff now,
[2316.16 - 2318.28] P:1718.45 E:0.098266 |  on Wales Australia from Gareth Lewis.
[2318.28 - 2321.00] P:1752.83 E:0.115200 |  Wales are a few miles an hour above your alleged driving speed,
[2321.00 - 2323.00] P:1751.38 E:0.109915 |  John, they've been relentless this second half,
[2323.00 - 2325.92] P:1841.34 E:0.111088 |  two early second half tries, Jack Morgan and Rio Daya,
[2325.92 - 2329.68] P:1776.85 E:0.105469 |  34-13 they lead, for that talk of pressure on Wayne Peabock,
[2329.68 - 2331.80] P:1774.81 E:0.100719 |  this is a record score against the Wallabies.
[2332.64 - 2336.00] P:1730.94 E:0.095566 |  Yeah, better sporting news for Wales today, then,
[2336.00 - 2340.40] P:1785.41 E:0.095859 |  and do join us, by the way, for England Wales, here in Qatar,
[2340.48 - 2342.24] P:1824.61 E:0.082751 |  on Tuesday night,
[2342.84 - 2346.64] P:1567.58 E:0.094350 |  and the ball is out of play for a throw-in to Denmark
[2346.64 - 2348.36] P:1647.11 E:0.083224 |  in their own left-back position.
[2348.36 - 2350.40] P:1372.08 E:0.093893 |  That's on BBC One as well, isn't it?
[2350.40 - 2351.40] P:1848.58 E:0.099522 |  Yes, it is.
[2351.40 - 2353.28] P:1665.91 E:0.073275 |  In Wales Tuesday night, so watch it, listen to it.
[2353.28 - 2354.28] P:1821.42 E:0.099786 |  Huge game.
[2354.28 - 2355.28] P:1712.05 E:0.055789 |  Yeah, huge match.
[2355.80 - 2358.32] P:1657.81 E:0.075108 |  France nil, Denmark nil,
[2359.12 - 2361.72] P:1581.73 E:0.088354 |  but that and Bapé Volley,
[2362.32 - 2365.60] P:1768.96 E:0.076532 |  that has been the highlight of the first half for me.
[2365.60 - 2366.96] P:1757.89 E:0.075692 |  What a touch.
[2367.72 - 2371.36] P:1854.19 E:0.070827 |  Came to nothing, but it was pure.
[2372.52 - 2374.64] P:1896.95 E:0.103377 |  Ball over the top by Dembele,
[2374.64 - 2377.92] P:1834.87 E:0.114172 |  ball over the top for Dembele, who gets it down and drives it across,
[2377.92 - 2381.96] P:1732.45 E:0.107899 |  and then, and Bapé arriving onto it on his right foot,
[2381.96 - 2385.40] P:1790.91 E:0.097974 |  13 yards out, blazes it over the top.
[2385.40 - 2388.32] P:1868.44 E:0.100920 |  And Dembele has got his head on his hands and rightly so,
[2388.32 - 2391.08] P:1757.14 E:0.105147 |  because he's looking at his teammate and Bapé there and thinking,
[2391.08 - 2393.28] P:1897.44 E:0.105344 |  I put it on a plate for you, it's 13 yards out.
[2393.28 - 2395.56] P:1834.76 E:0.096686 |  It wasn't that difficult a chance, was it?
[2395.60 - 2399.16] P:2005.13 E:0.100467 |  He does ever so well, the quick ball down the line onto the right-hand side,
[2399.16 - 2402.16] P:2124.67 E:0.097237 |  and Dembele looks up, Jiru runs to the near post,
[2402.16 - 2404.84] P:1876.86 E:0.083105 |  which then creates the space for him, Bapé.
[2404.84 - 2408.16] P:1653.38 E:0.095794 |  What's that, 20, 25 yards over the bar from on Bapé?
[2409.40 - 2411.08] P:1449.03 E:0.074805 |  So still nil-nil,
[2411.08 - 2414.84] P:1534.42 E:0.087193 |  and Dembele had every right to do a Christensen there, didn't he?
[2414.84 - 2416.88] P:1703.13 E:0.067483 |  To shake his face at him,
[2416.88 - 2420.56] P:1607.44 E:0.075853 |  but I don't think that's the kind of thing you do to him, Bapé.
[2420.56 - 2424.52] P:1817.18 E:0.102754 |  Typical, isn't it? We're just saying how good his volley was across the goal,
[2424.52 - 2427.08] P:1881.27 E:0.095303 |  and he's got a superb opportunity,
[2427.08 - 2429.92] P:1916.81 E:0.090602 |  probably the best opportunity of the game there,
[2429.92 - 2434.72] P:1728.15 E:0.085177 |  and you'd want it to fall to him, but he skies it really high over the bar.
[2434.72 - 2436.20] P:1629.76 E:0.071737 |  That's football. It is.
[2436.20 - 2437.76] P:1752.86 E:0.086917 |  I've done it a few times myself, John.
[2437.76 - 2441.36] P:1401.01 E:0.091430 |  Yeah, well, I would imagine that one of your old teammates,
[2441.36 - 2444.88] P:1574.39 E:0.087227 |  Philipp Albert, walked up the steps a little bit earlier.
[2444.88 - 2447.28] P:1400.83 E:0.082826 |  I imagine he's the sort of character that, when you did that,
[2447.28 - 2449.96] P:1447.53 E:0.099085 |  might have let you know about it, without me thinking that.
[2449.96 - 2452.40] P:1525.93 E:0.070072 |  Everyone let me know about it.
[2452.48 - 2454.52] P:1888.62 E:0.095380 |  I'm more so than being angry with myself,
[2454.52 - 2457.72] P:1580.77 E:0.075930 |  which I'm sure Bapé is at this moment in time.
[2457.72 - 2460.44] P:1278.44 E:0.090087 |  But I have to say, I wouldn't have recognised Philipp Albert
[2460.44 - 2463.00] P:1715.93 E:0.054867 |  if you hadn't pointed him out.
[2463.00 - 2466.20] P:1795.19 E:0.073931 |  Philipp Albert, everyone knows his name.
[2466.20 - 2468.80] P:1933.47 E:0.086918 |  Everyone knows his name, well done, John.
[2468.80 - 2473.88] P:1692.16 E:0.076098 |  France nil, Denmark nil, four minutes to go to half-time,
[2473.88 - 2479.68] P:1716.93 E:0.076503 |  and Bapé runs the ball out of play, so he's seen everything from him.
[2479.68 - 2480.68] P:1660.84 E:0.099816 |  He's human.
[2480.72 - 2483.72] P:1531.06 E:0.068290 |  But Denmark have dealt with him pretty well.
[2483.72 - 2486.08] P:1864.40 E:0.061430 |  Yeah, reasonably well. Absolutely.
[2486.08 - 2488.40] P:1772.70 E:0.054725 |  You're right, he had that volley,
[2488.40 - 2492.68] P:1840.23 E:0.078487 |  but he did find himself in acres of space there, 13 yards out,
[2492.68 - 2495.28] P:1794.74 E:0.097745 |  and that should have been in the back of the net for a guy of his ability.
[2495.28 - 2496.72] P:1722.38 E:0.079430 |  That wasn't a difficult chance.
[2496.72 - 2499.32] P:1720.25 E:0.087525 |  First time I've seen France lie at this World Cup
[2499.32 - 2502.64] P:1638.16 E:0.087578 |  and, you know, in advance to lose the names that they did.
[2502.64 - 2504.48] P:1427.79 E:0.085227 |  Some of the star players that they've lost,
[2504.48 - 2510.64] P:1704.94 E:0.073864 |  including during the tournament, Benzemaak and Hernandez, Lucas Hernandez,
[2510.64 - 2514.88] P:1719.77 E:0.072151 |  never mind Pogba and Kante, et cetera, and more.
[2514.88 - 2517.64] P:1734.82 E:0.092635 |  And yet to still have a team of this quality
[2517.64 - 2521.04] P:1763.99 E:0.086740 |  and the quality that they've gotten in the substitutes as well.
[2521.04 - 2523.60] P:1813.63 E:0.079324 |  Here's Griezmann playing it back, just turning,
[2523.60 - 2526.80] P:1827.83 E:0.085454 |  and Tuan Mayny there, one of the rising young stars,
[2526.80 - 2528.64] P:1671.89 E:0.087166 |  the 22-year-old from Real Madrid,
[2528.64 - 2531.84] P:1610.73 E:0.099614 |  lovely from Dembele, Koundale then runs into Nelson.
[2531.84 - 2533.44] P:1587.35 E:0.088395 |  Oh, that's nasty.
[2533.44 - 2536.20] P:1565.47 E:0.105168 |  That's nasty, I'm afraid. It's a yellow card.
[2536.20 - 2540.20] P:1761.66 E:0.087350 |  It was at pace, and Nelson, that's really hurt.
[2540.76 - 2544.96] P:1794.66 E:0.080849 |  I think it's down in the ankle area, and he's twisted away.
[2544.96 - 2546.76] P:1831.44 E:0.064554 |  He's holding his leg.
[2546.76 - 2551.44] P:1716.72 E:0.080377 |  I'm just hoping that it's one of those that, because of his movement,
[2551.44 - 2554.96] P:1596.91 E:0.088328 |  because of the way that he's moving down there, that he is going to be OK.
[2554.96 - 2557.16] P:1764.91 E:0.093542 |  Yeah, that was a nasty tackle that was.
[2557.16 - 2559.96] P:1845.94 E:0.106122 |  He realised that he wasn't going to get to the ball, you know,
[2559.96 - 2562.96] P:1822.05 E:0.089324 |  and he just pulled out at that last minute, but what he didn't do,
[2562.96 - 2565.44] P:1925.73 E:0.079389 |  he didn't pull his foot away, he left his foot there,
[2565.44 - 2569.60] P:1702.30 E:0.085551 |  which then meant he had nowhere to go other than the top of his ankle.
[2569.64 - 2571.24] P:1312.08 E:0.070076 |  And that was a nasty one.
[2571.24 - 2574.36] P:1408.06 E:0.083095 |  Yeah, the number three, Victor Nelson,
[2574.36 - 2577.76] P:1551.76 E:0.086714 |  who was playing his first match at a World Cup,
[2577.76 - 2580.84] P:1488.04 E:0.078498 |  24 years old, being brought in,
[2580.84 - 2585.16] P:1506.49 E:0.084383 |  and they're taking great care within here.
[2585.16 - 2588.88] P:1550.90 E:0.098271 |  What it means for the rest of the players is that, in these very warm conditions,
[2588.88 - 2592.24] P:1224.09 E:0.089430 |  if it's anything like this down at ground level inside this stadium,
[2592.24 - 2596.56] P:1648.78 E:0.079259 |  then the players will need a drink to dehydrate.
[2596.60 - 2601.76] P:1717.08 E:0.087571 |  And I see Giroux and Cornelius have just had a little word together.
[2601.76 - 2605.24] P:1634.48 E:0.070720 |  Everything's all right. Yeah, little slap of hands after there.
[2605.24 - 2607.56] P:1697.64 E:0.050981 |  They've had a couple of tussles.
[2607.56 - 2610.16] P:1485.42 E:0.097980 |  Foul by Cornelius in the centre-circle on Giroux.
[2610.16 - 2612.08] P:1879.16 E:0.057516 |  Cornelius was booked for that.
[2612.08 - 2614.84] P:1590.83 E:0.092039 |  And I'm pleased to say that Nelson is getting to his feet now,
[2614.84 - 2617.76] P:1711.19 E:0.072195 |  and he looks OK, but that could have been nasty.
[2617.76 - 2619.24] P:1859.43 E:0.070357 |  That could have been really nasty, yeah.
[2619.24 - 2622.80] P:1783.12 E:0.065893 |  It was a naughty one, that was.
[2622.80 - 2625.44] P:1767.41 E:0.078779 |  He could have pulled away, you know, but he chose not to.
[2625.48 - 2628.12] P:1824.56 E:0.097707 |  Only because he realised he wasn't going to get the ball,
[2628.12 - 2629.84] P:1904.81 E:0.094977 |  he could have lifted his leg up, but he didn't.
[2629.84 - 2632.88] P:1893.79 E:0.068221 |  He left his studs there, which left the outcome
[2632.88 - 2635.60] P:1863.01 E:0.093590 |  that he was going to be a nasty challenge, and it was.
[2635.60 - 2639.24] P:1783.34 E:0.071507 |  Now, a little screen here. We just had a graphic showing us
[2639.24 - 2642.84] P:1666.49 E:0.069956 |  the number of receptions that have been on the field.
[2642.84 - 2645.48] P:1685.47 E:0.074376 |  Some great terminology surrounding this World Cup.
[2645.48 - 2648.88] P:1693.40 E:0.064959 |  They've upped the term and not the stat terminology.
[2648.88 - 2651.84] P:1667.76 E:0.085091 |  And rather hope. Yeah, well, some might say that.
[2651.84 - 2654.12] P:1687.26 E:0.046247 |  Some might say that, receptions.
[2654.16 - 2657.56] P:1593.15 E:0.079457 |  I'm hoping later in the tournament, when it might calm down a little bit,
[2657.56 - 2660.80] P:1614.42 E:0.070890 |  I'm hoping we might get to one or two receptions.
[2660.80 - 2662.80] P:1761.44 E:0.045083 |  You'll see.
[2662.80 - 2665.48] P:1762.62 E:0.075274 |  Any way receptions.
[2665.48 - 2667.36] P:1670.88 E:0.062427 |  I was hoping you were going to tell me.
[2667.36 - 2668.60] P:1526.48 E:0.077413 |  I keep seeing these things.
[2668.60 - 2672.16] P:1536.13 E:0.090574 |  I need either Mark Chapman, who knows all the American terms.
[2672.16 - 2675.24] P:1725.44 E:0.071948 |  Of course, Statman Dave.
[2675.24 - 2679.60] P:1531.67 E:0.092638 |  Dave O'Brien knows them all, and he's on the World Cup daily every day,
[2679.60 - 2683.92] P:1797.44 E:0.075072 |  I think, every day on the podcast, which is free from BBC Sounds,
[2683.92 - 2686.96] P:1402.20 E:0.085078 |  where you get all the reaction, debates and analysis every morning.
[2686.96 - 2691.16] P:1797.94 E:0.066685 |  Then Mark coming forward, and he said, a shot that, I think,
[2691.16 - 2695.76] P:1665.48 E:0.091201 |  it's best to draw veil over that from Christian Ericsson from, what, 40 yards.
[2695.76 - 2697.92] P:1320.60 E:0.098999 |  That was rather tired, wasn't it?
[2697.92 - 2700.44] P:1814.54 E:0.097668 |  He was looking up for options, for forwards options.
[2700.44 - 2702.56] P:1746.28 E:0.104046 |  Looked to his left and his right, and there was nothing.
[2702.56 - 2703.84] P:1774.34 E:0.100309 |  Looked forward, still nothing.
[2703.84 - 2706.04] P:1786.69 E:0.095383 |  So, head down, thought, why not have a hit?
[2706.04 - 2708.44] P:1491.02 E:0.073682 |  Have a go. Well, it wasn't really a hit, was it?
[2708.44 - 2711.80] P:1590.53 E:0.087998 |  No, he pulled it wide, low shot, well wide of Larissa's goal.
[2711.96 - 2714.84] P:1825.64 E:0.083940 |  He's an old teammate, of course, Ericsson and Loris.
[2714.84 - 2719.84] P:1689.03 E:0.089448 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill, we're in added time at the end of the first half.
[2719.84 - 2723.28] P:1727.45 E:0.061531 |  It's been OK for Nill, Nill, haven't it?
[2723.28 - 2724.68] P:1780.64 E:0.066409 |  Yeah, it has, yeah.
[2724.68 - 2726.52] P:1612.18 E:0.092262 |  They've had one opportunity, haven't they, Denmark?
[2726.52 - 2728.72] P:1664.67 E:0.086043 |  Nothing on target at this moment in time.
[2728.72 - 2731.12] P:1888.82 E:0.080525 |  Struggled to get the ball into forward positions.
[2731.12 - 2735.00] P:1827.23 E:0.078322 |  Been tested once or twice defensively, but Kasper Schmeichel's been there,
[2735.00 - 2737.00] P:1807.00 E:0.083125 |  and then the main defended OK.
[2737.00 - 2740.24] P:1749.35 E:0.097607 |  Griezmann plays it into the space, Hernandez is taking it forward,
[2740.24 - 2742.68] P:1761.43 E:0.087440 |  he likes to do that every opportunity.
[2742.68 - 2747.88] P:1804.14 E:0.068504 |  And now Mbappe, we've seen good, very good, bad and indifferent
[2747.88 - 2750.28] P:1820.28 E:0.075282 |  from Mbappe in this first half.
[2750.28 - 2754.72] P:1742.47 E:0.083198 |  Now, he has Rabiol, Rabiol then chips it onto the chest of Mbappe,
[2754.72 - 2758.96] P:1709.41 E:0.085202 |  and Mbappe curls it in, and that was the indifferent.
[2758.96 - 2761.04] P:1724.45 E:0.089544 |  In fact, it was verging on the poor,
[2761.04 - 2763.08] P:1363.30 E:0.106923 |  and it was over everyone inside the penalty area,
[2763.08 - 2764.48] P:1577.09 E:0.083421 |  beyond the far-posed goal kick.
[2764.48 - 2767.20] P:1864.92 E:0.093822 |  That's your fault, ever since you said that was that, that great volley,
[2767.20 - 2768.68] P:1976.96 E:0.106914 |  you watched it on match with the day later on,
[2768.72 - 2771.40] P:1931.49 E:0.092133 |  he's had three touches, and every single one's gone out to play.
[2771.40 - 2776.32] P:1647.52 E:0.061881 |  Yeah, he's gone from pure to poor, if I can put it in the...
[2776.32 - 2778.32] P:1636.51 E:0.102673 |  You were going to say something else then?
[2781.40 - 2784.84] P:1872.69 E:0.074067 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill.
[2784.84 - 2790.64] P:1710.18 E:0.089159 |  So, at a time, Julien Nouron, I see, is in position to give his verdict
[2790.64 - 2794.60] P:1611.74 E:0.086644 |  on France at half-time, will be joined by Kelly,
[2794.64 - 2797.20] P:1763.77 E:0.082534 |  who's in our cat-art studio,
[2797.20 - 2799.48] P:1519.67 E:0.084700 |  which makes it sound a bit grander than it is,
[2799.48 - 2801.40] P:1483.10 E:0.085233 |  Alain, I don't know whether you've been in it yet,
[2801.40 - 2803.96] P:1732.29 E:0.075236 |  it's basically a room in a flat,
[2803.96 - 2806.92] P:1562.50 E:0.081759 |  as the ball is back towards the halfway line,
[2806.92 - 2810.80] P:1627.41 E:0.083898 |  and now it's Nelson, who slips the ball forward,
[2810.80 - 2813.36] P:1541.96 E:0.087288 |  and then Mailer on the left-hand side,
[2813.36 - 2815.44] P:1672.40 E:0.099333 |  and now Mailer looks to get it back, there's a stretch,
[2815.44 - 2818.36] P:1549.90 E:0.073571 |  but Mailer can't get there, and it's out of play for a throw.
[2818.36 - 2821.24] P:1684.93 E:0.081809 |  It's actually, it reminds me, when you go up that flat,
[2821.24 - 2823.64] P:1663.47 E:0.084657 |  because it's like a flat that's been converted into a studio,
[2823.68 - 2825.96] P:1621.14 E:0.081211 |  and there are people bustling about in every room,
[2825.96 - 2829.12] P:1685.88 E:0.093758 |  and it's what I imagine it to be like if you went into MI5,
[2829.12 - 2831.72] P:1606.96 E:0.102578 |  you know, who are operating on foreign territory,
[2831.72 - 2836.36] P:1800.45 E:0.068070 |  and they've converted this flat into a nerve centre,
[2836.36 - 2838.48] P:1519.84 E:0.101335 |  as Denmark bring it forward through the middle,
[2838.48 - 2841.12] P:1697.12 E:0.083128 |  but that's good work from Rabiot back in there,
[2841.12 - 2843.96] P:1720.55 E:0.098653 |  and then Griezmann just economically plays it out
[2843.96 - 2847.96] P:1720.34 E:0.092897 |  to the left-hand side, and then Hernandez gives it to Mbappe,
[2847.96 - 2851.36] P:1719.26 E:0.097337 |  and Mbappe's running at the Danish defence, and he goes for goal!
[2851.40 - 2853.60] P:1716.63 E:0.095758 |  Jérôme actually throws himself in front of it.
[2853.60 - 2855.76] P:1473.84 E:0.096041 |  I don't think he was trying to glance. What was he trying to do?
[2855.76 - 2856.92] P:1682.61 E:0.112223 |  He handed it back to him.
[2856.92 - 2858.72] P:2003.61 E:0.092403 |  I think he was trying to get out the way of it, you know,
[2858.72 - 2861.12] P:1715.49 E:0.098010 |  because I think Mbappe was maybe going for that far post,
[2861.12 - 2867.60] P:1845.99 E:0.077046 |  in the hope that he'd just catch the Casquah Schmeichel out of play there,
[2867.60 - 2869.92] P:1827.75 E:0.086209 |  because he was running towards that post himself,
[2869.92 - 2872.96] P:1863.79 E:0.068661 |  but he actually hits his teammate in Jérôme.
[2872.96 - 2875.72] P:1805.18 E:0.094232 |  So for his next trick, Mbappe's poll axed Jérôme.
[2876.72 - 2879.96] P:1734.24 E:0.059813 |  France-Nill, Denmark-Nill,
[2879.96 - 2883.96] P:1616.67 E:0.065302 |  and Nelson clears it over the halfway line,
[2883.96 - 2888.32] P:1809.23 E:0.086387 |  and that is the last action of the first half.
[2888.32 - 2890.96] P:1936.72 E:0.089602 |  France-Nill, Denmark-Nill,
[2890.96 - 2895.32] P:1784.48 E:0.091629 |  we've seen some really good stuff from France at times.
[2895.32 - 2896.68] P:1595.96 E:0.089023 |  They had the chances.
[2896.68 - 2901.08] P:1590.42 E:0.086262 |  Some of the deliveries into the penalty area were exquisite, excellent,
[2901.08 - 2903.08] P:1480.22 E:0.083601 |  but Denmark dealt with it.
[2903.08 - 2904.52] P:1551.70 E:0.080143 |  That's the important thing,
[2904.72 - 2907.24] P:1683.86 E:0.067027 |  and no goals, Alan.
[2907.24 - 2909.68] P:1785.38 E:0.101680 |  Yeah, no goals. That'll be the frustrating thing for France.
[2909.68 - 2913.12] P:1762.55 E:0.095675 |  Never really been put under too much pressure from Denmark.
[2913.12 - 2914.76] P:1947.02 E:0.103594 |  Had one or two good moments themselves,
[2914.76 - 2917.72] P:1795.07 E:0.087609 |  but haven't been able to find the back of the net yet.
[2917.72 - 2920.08] P:2045.44 E:0.106019 |  They're just that little bit missing in front of goal.
[2920.08 - 2921.48] P:1912.93 E:0.082299 |  Had one or two opportunities,
[2921.48 - 2924.16] P:1726.12 E:0.076675 |  but for a couple of good saves from Schmeichel.
[2924.16 - 2928.32] P:1692.19 E:0.092542 |  Yep, so far so good for Nelson and Friends against the French.
[2928.32 - 2931.88] P:1614.85 E:0.078736 |  At half time, France-Nill, Denmark-Nill.
[2931.88 - 2933.52] P:1637.64 E:0.103161 |  Excellent reference there, John Murray.
[2933.52 - 2936.16] P:1782.76 E:0.094909 |  Thank you very much for that back with John and with Alan Shearer
[2936.16 - 2939.68] P:1652.49 E:0.092950 |  for the second half of that game at the 9-7-4 stadium.
[2939.68 - 2941.76] P:1619.75 E:0.115260 |  We're also joined by Julian LeRon,
[2941.76 - 2944.20] P:1700.26 E:0.088471 |  and what we've been made aware of, Jules,
[2944.20 - 2947.36] P:1515.65 E:0.088987 |  is that you're being filmed by a FIFA film crew.
[2947.36 - 2949.48] P:1846.95 E:0.056415 |  Tell us more.
[2949.48 - 2950.92] P:1772.15 E:0.103907 |  That's right, Kelly. That's right.
[2950.92 - 2952.20] P:1588.03 E:0.104017 |  I mean, you can't miss them anywhere
[2952.20 - 2954.76] P:1314.21 E:0.092078 |  because they follow me everywhere, sound engineer, and the camera.
[2954.76 - 2957.28] P:1622.04 E:0.100661 |  Obviously, as many people do,
[2957.28 - 2960.96] P:1667.56 E:0.084657 |  it's them and all the people with their phones held up to film you.
[2960.96 - 2964.20] P:1649.51 E:0.097900 |  It would be for a Netflix documentary on the World Cup,
[2964.20 - 2965.92] P:1285.43 E:0.089346 |  and we'd also go on FIFA Plus.
[2965.92 - 2968.40] P:1665.09 E:0.095649 |  Not me, not me. I really show you. It's not me.
[2968.40 - 2971.40] P:1414.91 E:0.095958 |  I'll just be, I'll have a small pie in here, I think.
[2971.40 - 2973.04] P:2051.84 E:0.113377 |  I've shattered our illusions anyway.
[2973.04 - 2976.32] P:1790.04 E:0.075388 |  Me and John, we thought they were following us.
[2976.32 - 2979.08] P:1712.45 E:0.098987 |  I think you're the cutaway for this instance.
[2979.08 - 2980.40] P:1822.14 E:0.080853 |  Can I have a word?
[2980.40 - 2982.92] P:1861.82 E:0.096871 |  We're not that important anywhere, you see, John?
[2982.92 - 2985.32] P:1706.05 E:0.087128 |  Not anymore, I really say anything.
[2985.32 - 2987.48] P:1589.53 E:0.099545 |  The worst thing is when it gets captioned,
[2987.48 - 2989.44] P:1599.69 E:0.097951 |  and it says Julian LeRon and Friends.
[2991.92 - 2993.24] P:1848.75 E:0.091867 |  And two guys.
[2993.24 - 2997.84] P:1769.97 E:0.090701 |  Listen, to their four, you are the man to ask about this first half for Friends.
[2997.84 - 3000.60] P:1605.20 E:0.081163 |  How on earth are they not in front in this game?
[3000.60 - 3002.08] P:1642.96 E:0.101287 |  I'm wondering, too, Kelly.
[3002.08 - 3004.32] P:1406.09 E:0.102348 |  I thought there was a lot of very good things in that first half.
[3004.32 - 3006.36] P:1704.88 E:0.068165 |  I think he was very positive.
[3006.36 - 3010.36] P:1691.37 E:0.091886 |  They just need a bit in the final thirds,
[3010.36 - 3013.48] P:1791.77 E:0.076852 |  maybe a bit more efficiency, being a bit more clinical.
[3013.48 - 3016.08] P:1450.10 E:0.100602 |  I think on the ball from Dembili to Mbappe,
[3016.08 - 3019.80] P:1708.15 E:0.088577 |  and that one touch volley towards Jiru, Jiru is slightly late.
[3019.84 - 3022.08] P:1612.39 E:0.085573 |  But if he's maybe half a second earlier,
[3022.08 - 3024.76] P:1695.63 E:0.080465 |  I think he smashes the header in the back of the net,
[3024.76 - 3027.20] P:1664.79 E:0.083555 |  instead he goes wide with his shoulder.
[3027.20 - 3029.72] P:1701.56 E:0.085136 |  So it's not far, it's coming.
[3029.72 - 3033.04] P:1608.93 E:0.090970 |  What I was the most impressed with really is the control of that game.
[3033.04 - 3036.52] P:1905.16 E:0.085237 |  Apart from the Cornelius shot that might even have been offside,
[3036.52 - 3038.88] P:1505.78 E:0.101122 |  they didn't check because they didn't have to.
[3038.88 - 3040.76] P:1808.09 E:0.091898 |  There was nothing else really from the Danes,
[3040.76 - 3043.20] P:1859.18 E:0.084178 |  and we went on a pressure, I thought the midfield
[3043.20 - 3045.00] P:1706.82 E:0.112882 |  worked really, really hard through a mini-rabio,
[3045.00 - 3047.16] P:1809.12 E:0.070897 |  which we highlighted before the game.
[3047.20 - 3049.48] P:1781.48 E:0.077524 |  And then there's Griezmann, me and Alan.
[3049.48 - 3051.80] P:1736.02 E:0.090331 |  Before the game, we were just discussing it quickly,
[3051.80 - 3056.96] P:1604.42 E:0.080126 |  this new role for him, almost as an 8, as a hybrid 8 and 10.
[3056.96 - 3060.20] P:1656.33 E:0.093132 |  But just the way he fluidifies the game is fantastic.
[3060.20 - 3062.00] P:1745.32 E:0.083944 |  And because he works so hard,
[3062.00 - 3066.36] P:1838.79 E:0.082582 |  because this is the Atlético Madrid and Diego Cimeone's school,
[3066.36 - 3069.52] P:1638.30 E:0.100085 |  he will always come and defend and tackle and recover the ball.
[3069.52 - 3073.04] P:1680.51 E:0.082709 |  And I think he's recovered four or five balls already in that first half.
[3073.04 - 3076.56] P:1782.57 E:0.092841 |  And he has become so important in that new formation
[3076.56 - 3079.52] P:1607.21 E:0.090273 |  that I think, again, apart from the fight that they haven't scored,
[3079.52 - 3081.52] P:1778.92 E:0.046073 |  there was a lot of positives so far.
[3081.52 - 3083.00] P:1717.13 E:0.085973 |  Lot of positives for France.
[3083.00 - 3085.24] P:1645.41 E:0.090513 |  We'll have a bit more chat on that very shortly.
[3085.24 - 3087.68] P:1643.45 E:0.083708 |  We'll also update you with all the rest of the day's sport
[3087.68 - 3090.28] P:1812.51 E:0.063826 |  after the BBC News with Jill McKenzie.
[3090.28 - 3091.96] P:1453.97 E:0.140832 |  Take the World Cup with you.
[3091.96 - 3095.04] P:1318.28 E:0.115538 |  Catar 2022 on BBC Sounds.
[3095.04 - 3098.16] P:1675.73 E:0.117313 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3098.16 - 3100.48] P:1299.81 E:0.109047 |  The Commissioner of London Fire Brigade says it's likely
[3100.48 - 3103.04] P:1491.70 E:0.095687 |  some people will lose their jobs after a review
[3103.04 - 3107.20] P:1955.40 E:0.090387 |  found the organisation was institutionally misogynistic and racist.
[3107.20 - 3110.24] P:1789.70 E:0.090718 |  Andy Rose says he's heartbroken and has promised change.
[3110.24 - 3112.84] P:1436.17 E:0.075856 |  London Mayor Sadiq Khan has echoed that.
[3112.84 - 3116.68] P:1813.30 E:0.075307 |  This report has to be a watershed moment
[3116.68 - 3119.36] P:1761.65 E:0.087473 |  when we get rid of the institutional racism,
[3119.36 - 3123.44] P:1733.93 E:0.082486 |  homophobia and discrimination that exists in our fire services.
[3123.44 - 3126.44] P:1763.30 E:0.073958 |  It's possible to say we've got some wonderful firefighters,
[3126.44 - 3128.96] P:1687.19 E:0.066707 |  but there are serious problems in the fire brigade.
[3128.96 - 3131.04] P:1038.87 E:0.099982 |  The Home Office says the death of a man who was held
[3131.04 - 3133.80] P:1566.84 E:0.089888 |  at the Manstern Migrant Processing Centre in Kent
[3133.80 - 3136.00] P:1724.26 E:0.086522 |  may have been caused by diphtheria.
[3136.00 - 3137.76] P:1893.04 E:0.092969 |  He died in hospital last week.
[3137.76 - 3141.88] P:1612.42 E:0.074975 |  It's understood he got to the UK by crossing the channel on a small boat.
[3141.88 - 3146.24] P:1699.19 E:0.089549 |  Several people are missing after a mud slide on the Italian island of Ischia.
[3146.24 - 3148.72] P:1673.43 E:0.098835 |  Heavy rain triggered a torrent of mud and debris,
[3148.72 - 3153.00] P:1650.33 E:0.071078 |  which swept away houses and dragged cars into the sea.
[3153.00 - 3154.96] P:1572.41 E:0.100250 |  Rail travel is being disrupted this weekend
[3154.96 - 3157.76] P:1478.66 E:0.094618 |  as train drivers at 11 companies have walked out.
[3157.76 - 3160.16] P:1652.59 E:0.109314 |  The strike action by members of the Aslef Union
[3160.16 - 3163.04] P:1697.69 E:0.077217 |  is part of a long-running row over pay.
[3163.04 - 3165.32] P:1629.65 E:0.107540 |  And videos posted on social media in China
[3165.32 - 3168.52] P:1893.09 E:0.072800 |  appear to show fresh protests against COVID restrictions
[3168.52 - 3172.32] P:1596.72 E:0.085905 |  after a fire in an apartment block which killed 10 people.
[3172.32 - 3175.88] P:1776.65 E:0.092293 |  Authorities in Urumqi have denied that the restrictions
[3175.88 - 3177.88] P:1819.34 E:0.080241 |  stopped people escaping the fire.
[3177.88 - 3181.00] P:1315.53 E:0.074079 |  Beijing is still pursuing its zero COVID policy.
[3181.72 - 3184.08] P:1381.83 E:0.121092 |  This is a public service announcement.
[3184.08 - 3185.56] P:1714.71 E:0.125415 |  Weekdays from 2.
[3185.56 - 3188.48] P:1858.00 E:0.115303 |  It's time for Scott Mills on Radio 2.
[3188.48 - 3190.28] P:1734.71 E:0.124707 |  Would you mind doing me a quick review?
[3190.28 - 3192.36] P:2072.42 E:0.127717 |  You do brilliant. I've been enjoying you on Radio 2.
[3192.36 - 3194.04] P:1634.88 E:0.131393 |  You're a very nice mum.
[3194.04 - 3195.08] P:1809.20 E:0.105228 |  Thank you very much.
[3195.08 - 3198.28] P:1404.31 E:0.120675 |  Every time this comes on Radio 2, I turn it right up.
[3198.28 - 3200.00] P:1945.41 E:0.118977 |  The heads go in, the shoulders go in.
[3200.00 - 3201.92] P:1959.34 E:0.105707 |  I'm, like, bouncing around on the seat.
[3201.92 - 3204.32] P:1556.91 E:0.123174 |  Probably one of the world's most embarrassing mums
[3204.32 - 3205.68] P:1837.10 E:0.106757 |  because of your show.
[3205.68 - 3207.96] P:1584.47 E:0.118769 |  Scott Mills on Radio 2.
[3207.96 - 3211.24] P:1448.94 E:0.121702 |  Tell all your friends on that school run to turn Radio 2 on as well.
[3211.24 - 3213.28] P:1829.38 E:0.123997 |  Oh, yeah, absolutely. Scott Mills all the way.
[3213.28 - 3214.84] P:2010.47 E:0.114649 |  Weekdays from 2.
[3214.84 - 3216.76] P:1207.62 E:0.120071 |  Listen live on BBC Sound.
[3218.48 - 3220.32] P:1448.38 E:0.129632 |  BBC Five Live.
[3220.32 - 3222.00] P:964.96 E:0.132001 |  The FIFA World Cup.
[3222.00 - 3225.36] P:1202.64 E:0.119784 |  Qatar 2022 with Kelly Capes.
[3225.36 - 3227.52] P:1637.66 E:0.081340 |  At 7 o'clock this evening,
[3227.52 - 3231.68] P:1688.40 E:0.095774 |  Argentina are looking to kickstart their World Cup campaign
[3231.68 - 3234.52] P:1573.45 E:0.105489 |  after an opening day defeat by Saudi Arabia.
[3234.52 - 3236.28] P:1738.64 E:0.088975 |  They take on Mexico.
[3236.28 - 3238.36] P:1558.77 E:0.097182 |  Full commentary of that one from 7.
[3238.36 - 3240.28] P:1732.63 E:0.097225 |  From the Lissalle Stadium.
[3240.28 - 3242.80] P:1581.43 E:0.087439 |  4 o'clock kickoff was france against Denmark,
[3242.80 - 3245.92] P:1656.51 E:0.095115 |  so we're back there for the second half very shortly.
[3245.92 - 3248.96] P:1576.28 E:0.113400 |  And we can bring you up to date on the big rugby union
[3248.96 - 3251.12] P:1566.38 E:0.097010 |  internationals taking place this evening.
[3251.12 - 3252.32] P:1552.34 E:0.107299 |  Let's get the waste to the ladies.
[3252.32 - 3254.92] P:1527.12 E:0.104670 |  First of all, from Wales against Australia with Garth Lewis.
[3254.92 - 3256.28] P:1866.52 E:0.094850 |  Yeah, this is Wales' to win now.
[3256.28 - 3257.68] P:1773.66 E:0.104228 |  34-18 they lead.
[3257.68 - 3259.48] P:1664.49 E:0.102355 |  Four tries on top.
[3259.48 - 3262.92] P:1746.07 E:0.103150 |  Australia have narrowed the gap after a strong finished by Mark Nawan,
[3262.92 - 3264.16] P:1552.54 E:0.094668 |  Kanete Wase.
[3264.16 - 3265.68] P:1634.75 E:0.112472 |  I'm glad we're not doing commentary this afternoon.
[3265.68 - 3268.56] P:1809.26 E:0.098299 |  So Wales then on course for the victory they need and they wanted.
[3268.56 - 3271.28] P:1834.54 E:0.100336 |  The big question, though, bearing in mind Australia
[3271.28 - 3274.24] P:1716.88 E:0.095626 |  and without 14 players for this fixture this afternoon,
[3274.28 - 3278.16] P:1735.59 E:0.098750 |  how much does it ease the pressure on Wales head coach Wayne Peabock?
[3278.16 - 3279.44] P:1765.36 E:0.110196 |  34-18 Wales lead,
[3279.44 - 3283.20] P:1714.07 E:0.093682 |  although Justin Tipperick, the captain, has just been sinvend.
[3283.20 - 3284.56] P:1577.73 E:0.122551 |  Garth, thank you very much for that.
[3284.56 - 3286.56] P:1416.09 E:0.096538 |  Garth Lewis keeping us across everything there
[3286.56 - 3289.64] P:1736.41 E:0.079022 |  and we're getting ever closer to kick off at Twickenham,
[3289.64 - 3292.60] P:1679.70 E:0.089410 |  where England will take on South Africa at 5.30.
[3292.60 - 3294.48] P:1784.19 E:0.092424 |  Chris Jones is there for us,
[3294.48 - 3296.92] P:1723.83 E:0.076614 |  and it's equally important for both sides, Chris.
[3296.92 - 3298.36] P:1972.79 E:0.091886 |  It feels that way, doesn't it, Kelly?
[3298.36 - 3301.60] P:1770.48 E:0.088797 |  Both sides have had an up and down kind of November,
[3301.60 - 3303.32] P:1825.54 E:0.086381 |  so Africa have lost in Dublin,
[3303.36 - 3304.56] P:1776.17 E:0.094741 |  and they've lost in Paris,
[3304.56 - 3307.52] P:1847.69 E:0.083077 |  but had a very impressive win against Italy last time.
[3307.52 - 3310.64] P:1834.57 E:0.081949 |  At England with that defeat by Argentina
[3310.64 - 3312.44] P:1624.67 E:0.091210 |  at the front of the month, they recovered against Japan,
[3312.44 - 3315.92] P:1998.39 E:0.086618 |  and that crazy game against New Zealand this time last weekend.
[3315.92 - 3317.28] P:1929.32 E:0.078088 |  For 60 minutes we thought,
[3317.28 - 3319.60] P:1779.14 E:0.090844 |  is this as bad as England have been under, ready, Jones?
[3319.60 - 3321.60] P:1711.62 E:0.095000 |  And then they pulled out the bag in the final 10,
[3321.60 - 3325.40] P:1944.59 E:0.073945 |  scored three great tries and had this place on its feet.
[3325.40 - 3327.60] P:1815.84 E:0.079268 |  England said they want to get Twickenham bouncing,
[3327.60 - 3330.60] P:1862.62 E:0.063985 |  but this week not just for 10 minutes, for 80+.
[3330.64 - 3333.36] P:1647.30 E:0.098725 |  Yeah, you called it a cure at Zeg on the podcast,
[3333.36 - 3336.20] P:1731.59 E:0.069355 |  and it's hard to predict because of that performance
[3336.20 - 3339.28] P:1622.53 E:0.087196 |  how England are going to turn up for this one against South Africa.
[3339.28 - 3340.88] P:2091.93 E:0.089694 |  And that's the big question, Kelly.
[3340.88 - 3343.44] P:1835.26 E:0.087717 |  Was that final 10 minutes an outlier?
[3343.44 - 3345.96] P:1959.45 E:0.090560 |  And actually we should be focusing on the 60 or 70.
[3345.96 - 3348.04] P:1856.07 E:0.089014 |  When England did some good stuff, don't get me wrong,
[3348.04 - 3350.60] P:1877.87 E:0.079905 |  but countless times they got to the 22
[3350.60 - 3351.88] P:1888.37 E:0.084398 |  and weren't able to execute.
[3351.88 - 3353.88] P:1808.14 E:0.087226 |  Would you look at that final 10 and go, right,
[3353.88 - 3355.96] P:1824.80 E:0.074634 |  that's when England have turned a corner.
[3355.96 - 3358.80] P:1973.54 E:0.072160 |  That's the England team they keep promising they're going to be.
[3358.80 - 3361.36] P:1953.58 E:0.081425 |  That's England team that can explode into next year,
[3361.36 - 3365.48] P:1867.36 E:0.087208 |  into World Cup year and make a real dart on that World Cup trophy.
[3365.48 - 3366.88] P:1961.28 E:0.098286 |  Hopefully we'll get some more answers
[3366.88 - 3368.96] P:1930.22 E:0.054918 |  after the 80 minutes this afternoon.
[3368.96 - 3372.64] P:1536.13 E:0.104902 |  Eddie Jones has been joking that Razio Rasmus might emulate Jose Mourinho
[3372.64 - 3375.20] P:1753.16 E:0.082019 |  by hiding in a laundry basket for this one,
[3375.20 - 3378.56] P:1639.93 E:0.093735 |  because he's been banned again over tweets about refereeing.
[3378.56 - 3379.76] P:1432.63 E:0.090985 |  What's been going on?
[3379.76 - 3382.72] P:1785.29 E:0.097614 |  Well, you wouldn't put it past the Rasmus to find his way into Twickenham,
[3382.72 - 3384.88] P:1864.50 E:0.081964 |  come on, mate, but he is banned from involvement
[3384.88 - 3387.00] P:1851.91 E:0.084944 |  with the Springbok squad on match day.
[3387.04 - 3389.04] P:1847.63 E:0.087470 |  This has been a saga going back 18 months.
[3389.04 - 3393.88] P:1993.09 E:0.083429 |  If you remember, he unleashed that extraordinary hour-long kind of diatribe
[3393.88 - 3399.32] P:1963.53 E:0.079664 |  against the officials after the first test of the Lions series in 2021.
[3399.32 - 3400.44] P:1662.98 E:0.095486 |  That got him a year ban.
[3400.44 - 3403.76] P:1758.73 E:0.087088 |  He came back from that ban and then was tweeting away after the Arling game,
[3403.76 - 3405.76] P:1769.73 E:0.096151 |  tweeting away after the France game,
[3405.76 - 3408.64] P:1920.92 E:0.085512 |  and he's got a straight two game matchday ban from World Rugby.
[3408.64 - 3410.36] P:1859.82 E:0.082706 |  There is an update, Kelly.
[3410.36 - 3413.36] P:1667.08 E:0.092094 |  Razmus and South African Rugby have released a statement today saying
[3413.36 - 3415.88] P:1793.32 E:0.085517 |  they met with World Rugby on Thursday.
[3415.92 - 3419.80] P:1854.38 E:0.079753 |  They had, quote, positive discussions and they agreed, all parties, apparently,
[3419.80 - 3423.24] P:1799.16 E:0.080875 |  that further dialogue was needed in terms of enhancing the process
[3423.24 - 3425.56] P:1811.78 E:0.078990 |  that operates between teams and match officials.
[3425.56 - 3427.84] P:1862.89 E:0.092539 |  That statement implies that no one's really at fault,
[3427.84 - 3430.24] P:1816.04 E:0.085606 |  and it's Arasmus and World Rugby who are to blame.
[3430.24 - 3433.76] P:1907.30 E:0.085599 |  But in reality, Arasmus has gone so rogue over the past 18 months.
[3433.76 - 3435.32] P:1661.12 E:0.077403 |  A ban was inevitable.
[3435.32 - 3437.92] P:1757.46 E:0.081621 |  Let's hope, though, this is a line in the sand.
[3437.92 - 3442.00] P:1840.05 E:0.065317 |  And after the game today, we're talking about the players rather than the officials.
[3442.00 - 3444.28] P:1633.02 E:0.088534 |  Yes, further dialogue, just not on Twitter.
[3444.28 - 3447.12] P:1797.28 E:0.087169 |  Chris Jones there with the update. Thank you very much for that.
[3447.12 - 3450.16] P:1897.42 E:0.103679 |  And there's been a try at the match between Wales and Australia.
[3450.16 - 3451.16] P:1708.70 E:0.075450 |  Gareth Lewis.
[3454.32 - 3455.76] P:1898.76 E:0.122485 |  Yeah, another try for Australia.
[3455.76 - 3458.24] P:1939.02 E:0.095967 |  It's that man again, Mark Nawang Kanat-Iwasi,
[3458.24 - 3461.32] P:1825.70 E:0.098098 |  completely against the run of play, just in Tipperwick in the Sinbin.
[3461.32 - 3464.56] P:1778.24 E:0.101831 |  Australia have pulled it back to a nine-point deficit.
[3464.56 - 3467.88] P:1836.16 E:0.111633 |  They're on top this past five minutes, too, with just nine minutes to go.
[3467.88 - 3471.12] P:1825.39 E:0.096233 |  Wales 34, Australia 25 from nowhere.
[3471.12 - 3474.08] P:1716.46 E:0.095373 |  It is suddenly a very, very nervy finishing cardiff.
[3474.48 - 3476.20] P:1493.16 E:0.119813 |  Oh, Gareth, that's exactly what they don't want.
[3476.20 - 3477.48] P:1741.19 E:0.110456 |  Thank you so much for joining us.
[3477.48 - 3480.08] P:1646.32 E:0.073446 |  Gareth will keep us up to date with everything that happens there.
[3480.08 - 3483.60] P:1615.66 E:0.107453 |  Meanwhile, in the FA Cup, it's Forrest Green against Alva Church,
[3483.60 - 3485.12] P:1687.61 E:0.074037 |  and Chris Coles is watching.
[3485.12 - 3489.32] P:1782.44 E:0.098435 |  And Forrest Green are into the third round of the FA Cup, Kelly, for the first time.
[3489.32 - 3492.64] P:1899.41 E:0.098595 |  In 12 years, they've beaten non-league Alva Church 2-1.
[3492.64 - 3496.72] P:2009.87 E:0.090444 |  Conor Wickham's penalty, Josh March's stooping header, a glorious
[3496.72 - 3500.04] P:1904.12 E:0.093760 |  Jed Abbey equaliser for Alva Church, sandwiched in between.
[3500.04 - 3503.56] P:1901.88 E:0.091383 |  The final 20 minutes had to be carefully negotiated
[3503.56 - 3505.48] P:2037.04 E:0.095811 |  with Forrest Green reduced to 10 men.
[3505.48 - 3509.76] P:1966.02 E:0.093370 |  Don Bernard sent off the two yellow cards, two late challenges, one in each half.
[3509.76 - 3513.56] P:1936.89 E:0.091839 |  It did give the non-league side a lift, but they didn't take advantage.
[3513.56 - 3517.04] P:1819.87 E:0.089091 |  And their valiant run in the FA Cup ends in the second round.
[3517.04 - 3520.80] P:1926.30 E:0.092549 |  Forrest Green have a place in Monday's draw, 2-1 winners over Alva Church.
[3521.60 - 3522.52] P:1780.04 E:0.114040 |  Thank you very much for that.
[3522.52 - 3524.88] P:1712.44 E:0.083639 |  Chris Ellsworth, Chesterfield of the National League have beaten
[3524.88 - 3527.72] P:1959.42 E:0.080948 |  League 2 AFC Wimbledon 2-0.
[3527.72 - 3530.84] P:1460.10 E:0.086587 |  National League South Farnborough are drawing one all at Wrexham.
[3530.84 - 3534.88] P:1662.70 E:0.072651 |  And you can follow all the scores on the BBC Sport website and app.
[3534.88 - 3537.36] P:1627.03 E:0.096421 |  Also to come on Five Live tonight, there's live commentary of
[3537.36 - 3540.24] P:1761.76 E:0.076716 |  Gillian White's heavyweight fight at Wembley against the unbeaten
[3540.24 - 3541.48] P:1578.19 E:0.081545 |  American Jermaine Franklin.
[3541.48 - 3546.64] P:1929.56 E:0.082484 |  That will be in Stephen Nolan's show, which starts around about 10.15.
[3546.64 - 3548.84] P:1690.13 E:0.095207 |  Tonight, though, we're going to have second half commentary
[3548.84 - 3553.08] P:1833.30 E:0.082229 |  this afternoon of France against Denmark, followed by Argentina
[3553.08 - 3554.00] P:1499.04 E:0.074836 |  against Mexico.
[3554.00 - 3558.76] P:1757.21 E:0.082678 |  Final game of the day, Argentina trying to get their World Cup up and running.
[3558.88 - 3561.96] P:1406.33 E:0.084768 |  Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton are a commentary team for that one.
[3562.52 - 3566.16] P:1761.65 E:0.112168 |  Guys, you'll be delighted to know I'm coming to see you at the LaSalle stadium.
[3566.16 - 3568.16] P:1931.78 E:0.051661 |  What can I expect?
[3568.16 - 3571.32] P:2080.02 E:0.060157 |  You can expect a pretty breathtaking view.
[3571.32 - 3572.56] P:2008.93 E:0.074902 |  It's the stadium, Kelly.
[3572.56 - 3574.28] P:1744.95 E:0.092751 |  We were in for the Brazil game the other night.
[3574.28 - 3576.80] P:1832.06 E:0.081969 |  The atmosphere in here for that one was incredible.
[3576.80 - 3579.96] P:1910.48 E:0.090683 |  It's absolutely enormous, holds almost 90,000 fans,
[3580.24 - 3585.44] P:1761.26 E:0.086223 |  loads and loads of Argentina fans in particular, already inside the stadium.
[3585.44 - 3588.32] P:1779.62 E:0.087679 |  And I'm slightly worried, Kelly, that Chris's head might explode
[3588.36 - 3591.32] P:1805.86 E:0.091846 |  during the commentary because he's done about three sheets of A4
[3591.60 - 3594.68] P:1786.70 E:0.092400 |  on the possible permutations in this group.
[3594.68 - 3596.60] P:1884.61 E:0.082360 |  The key one, though, the key one, Kelly.
[3596.60 - 3599.24] P:1875.01 E:0.082704 |  And this is what makes this so interesting, so exciting tonight.
[3599.24 - 3605.28] P:1791.46 E:0.080674 |  The real jeopardy of it is if Argentina lose the game, they are out of the World Cup.
[3605.28 - 3608.20] P:1919.38 E:0.090063 |  We think it may well be Lionel Messi's last World Cup tonight.
[3608.20 - 3612.92] P:1842.81 E:0.083073 |  He equals Diego Maradona, the great Maradona for number of World Cup appearances.
[3612.92 - 3615.32] P:2003.62 E:0.078104 |  If he starts the game, we haven't got the team sheet as yet.
[3615.44 - 3617.88] P:1870.65 E:0.089819 |  He's one goal behind him in terms of World Cup goals.
[3617.88 - 3621.24] P:1912.60 E:0.082333 |  Crucially, he's won World Cup win behind him as well.
[3621.32 - 3624.72] P:1867.10 E:0.079263 |  And I think you could speculate, and this is only speculation.
[3624.72 - 3629.48] P:1920.40 E:0.082634 |  If Argentina were to lose this game, would he definitely start in the final game
[3629.48 - 3631.04] P:1814.36 E:0.078099 |  if nothing was on it against Poland?
[3631.04 - 3633.32] P:1635.98 E:0.092565 |  Could it be Messi's very long start?
[3633.32 - 3634.68] P:1959.50 E:0.080164 |  That's speculation, isn't it?
[3634.68 - 3636.44] P:1741.19 E:0.040848 |  It absolutely is, Chris.
[3636.44 - 3638.44] P:1532.33 E:0.095163 |  And that's what you'll be doing post-match,
[3638.44 - 3643.68] P:1684.55 E:0.083195 |  should Argentina be not progressing to the group stages if they lose this game.
[3643.68 - 3647.36] P:1619.49 E:0.089956 |  But as Ali was saying, there are so many possibilities in this group
[3647.36 - 3651.72] P:1622.35 E:0.085657 |  because Argentina were beaten so unexpectedly by Saudi Arabia.
[3651.72 - 3653.80] P:1577.70 E:0.083265 |  It's thrown everything wide open, Chris.
[3654.48 - 3655.76] P:1690.41 E:0.098790 |  It absolutely has.
[3655.76 - 3658.68] P:1607.66 E:0.091801 |  I've just spent the last 45 minutes writing down all the permutations.
[3658.68 - 3661.56] P:1538.59 E:0.093118 |  We haven't got long enough now to go through them.
[3661.56 - 3664.60] P:1719.26 E:0.088513 |  I will explain all later, but what do we know?
[3664.60 - 3665.60] P:1744.39 E:0.118088 |  In detail.
[3665.60 - 3669.40] P:1519.51 E:0.056299 |  Argentina in great detail.
[3670.00 - 3672.16] P:1919.14 E:0.099776 |  But Argentina are under severe pressure,
[3672.16 - 3676.12] P:1679.00 E:0.087156 |  and nobody really could have believed that they're in this position
[3676.16 - 3678.36] P:1732.97 E:0.087248 |  after playing Saudi Arabia in the first game.
[3678.36 - 3681.76] P:1899.40 E:0.084351 |  So we know the expectation back in Argentina.
[3681.76 - 3685.64] P:1764.76 E:0.084983 |  There's a great expectancy every time that they enter a World Cup competition.
[3685.64 - 3690.12] P:1896.03 E:0.076184 |  And of course, you know, it could be Messi's last World Cup this.
[3690.12 - 3691.60] P:1680.80 E:0.101739 |  He will want to go out on a high.
[3691.60 - 3697.32] P:1816.26 E:0.066801 |  So really, it's a game that Argentina feel that they have to win.
[3697.32 - 3699.24] P:1262.88 E:0.101751 |  Chris, I want to ask you as well about the reports
[3699.24 - 3702.24] P:1553.08 E:0.078914 |  that Rangers have been given permission to talk to Michael Beal
[3702.24 - 3704.00] P:1440.31 E:0.086420 |  about their vacant manager's position.
[3704.00 - 3706.72] P:1528.74 E:0.073902 |  He's at QPR, of course, at the moment.
[3706.72 - 3708.72] P:1553.68 E:0.066133 |  What are your thoughts on that?
[3710.08 - 3711.56] P:1785.97 E:0.064365 |  What are my thoughts on that?
[3711.56 - 3714.88] P:1809.43 E:0.072855 |  Well, you know, he was there before, wasn't he, Michael Beal?
[3714.88 - 3719.12] P:1715.90 E:0.084118 |  The thing I can't get my head around is it was only a few weeks ago.
[3719.12 - 3721.04] P:1757.10 E:0.071340 |  I think he was offered the Wolves job.
[3721.04 - 3725.48] P:1845.38 E:0.085232 |  And then, you know, he got a lot of praise because he said he's going to stay at QPR
[3725.48 - 3729.80] P:1837.84 E:0.081665 |  because of loyalty towards the QPR players.
[3730.24 - 3732.40] P:1665.11 E:0.089023 |  So, you know, I've got to say, if you're a QPR fan,
[3732.40 - 3737.88] P:1678.99 E:0.083438 |  you look at him like as a bit of a turncoat if he goes up and gets the Rangers job.
[3737.88 - 3740.48] P:1695.79 E:0.081605 |  But, you know, he knows the club inside out,
[3740.48 - 3745.96] P:1646.23 E:0.086773 |  made a bit of an impact under Steven Gerrard, you know, as a coach there.
[3745.96 - 3748.08] P:1824.33 E:0.091877 |  So, I mean, it's one to watch.
[3748.08 - 3751.56] P:1809.29 E:0.085461 |  But my biggest take on it, if you're a QPR fan,
[3751.56 - 3753.92] P:1517.85 E:0.092383 |  I think you're going to be really disappointed in Michael Beal
[3753.92 - 3756.36] P:1739.58 E:0.050969 |  if he goes up and talks to Rangers.
[3756.36 - 3760.36] P:1663.54 E:0.092341 |  Yeah, your focus this evening, though, very much on Argentina against Mexico.
[3760.36 - 3762.88] P:1478.98 E:0.099576 |  Chris Attenin, Alistair Bruce Ball from the La Seille Stadium.
[3762.88 - 3765.44] P:1676.49 E:0.081880 |  Mark Chapman will bring you coverage of that.
[3765.44 - 3768.40] P:1863.61 E:0.094464 |  Julian Laurent is watching France against Denmark.
[3768.40 - 3771.88] P:1752.42 E:0.084848 |  No goals as yet, but plenty of chances for France in that game.
[3771.88 - 3777.00] P:1914.61 E:0.095356 |  John Murray was saying in commentary jewels that Kylian Mbappe was so frustrating.
[3777.00 - 3779.72] P:1724.05 E:0.097656 |  There was the good, the bad and the indifferent from him.
[3779.72 - 3782.76] P:1927.59 E:0.090321 |  It's almost as though he's got maybe frustrated,
[3782.76 - 3786.04] P:1796.59 E:0.100015 |  maybe even bored and uninterested as the game's gone on
[3786.04 - 3789.56] P:1711.76 E:0.080268 |  without him being able to impose himself on it.
[3789.56 - 3791.08] P:1554.59 E:0.107410 |  Yes, it's incredible, really.
[3791.08 - 3793.96] P:1690.48 E:0.083970 |  I mean, we said, remember before the Australian game,
[3793.96 - 3795.60] P:1843.03 E:0.093854 |  that he wanted this to be his stage.
[3795.60 - 3798.72] P:1817.63 E:0.089742 |  And the problem is, I think sometimes he wants it too much.
[3798.72 - 3802.56] P:1860.19 E:0.085804 |  So, he tries too hard, in a sense, because he wants it to...
[3802.56 - 3804.56] P:1795.60 E:0.105620 |  He wants to make it happen every time he touches the ball,
[3804.56 - 3805.72] P:1812.92 E:0.094865 |  which is not really possible.
[3805.72 - 3809.24] P:1879.23 E:0.084939 |  So, at times, it makes the wrong decisions.
[3809.24 - 3811.00] P:1730.22 E:0.084399 |  Too many times, maybe.
[3811.00 - 3813.36] P:1777.42 E:0.108056 |  But then you also know that the one time he would make the right decision,
[3813.36 - 3814.20] P:1528.53 E:0.099919 |  something will happen.
[3814.20 - 3816.36] P:1965.71 E:0.090088 |  So, it is frustrating at times.
[3816.36 - 3817.84] P:1848.00 E:0.085621 |  He's still only 23.
[3817.84 - 3820.84] P:1906.48 E:0.079349 |  That would come with age and experience, I guess.
[3820.84 - 3823.76] P:1757.78 E:0.089321 |  But again, he has to come through him,
[3823.76 - 3829.28] P:1839.93 E:0.076987 |  because I think he's, again, the most important asset that we have going forward.
[3829.28 - 3831.04] P:1723.36 E:0.113232 |  The thoughts there of Julian Laurent,
[3831.04 - 3834.68] P:1807.26 E:0.088170 |  French football journalist and subject of a Netflix documentary.
[3834.68 - 3836.68] P:1847.95 E:0.104396 |  Thank you very much for joining us, Jules.
[3836.68 - 3837.80] P:1672.23 E:0.109658 |  Good to hear your thoughts.
[3837.80 - 3840.28] P:1733.44 E:0.095708 |  I'm sure we're here from your full time as well.
[3840.28 - 3842.00] P:1828.96 E:0.078950 |  Thank you very much to Julian.
[3842.00 - 3846.12] P:1739.33 E:0.101839 |  Time now for the second half to get underway with Alan Shearer and John Murray.
[3846.16 - 3847.40] P:1810.00 E:0.074126 |  Thank you, Kelly.
[3847.40 - 3850.72] P:1795.58 E:0.057029 |  I feel honoured, don't you?
[3850.72 - 3853.76] P:1684.16 E:0.098500 |  Well, I feel disappointed that the cameras weren't for us.
[3853.76 - 3858.56] P:1652.68 E:0.072415 |  Jules is Netflix, man, and all that sort of thing, all the rage.
[3858.56 - 3860.32] P:1649.74 E:0.101279 |  Right, second half underway.
[3860.32 - 3862.16] P:1590.62 E:0.090191 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill.
[3862.16 - 3863.48] P:1797.59 E:0.089256 |  Denmark have made a change.
[3863.48 - 3867.12] P:1683.23 E:0.082177 |  They've taken off the centre forward, Cornelius,
[3867.12 - 3870.08] P:1451.39 E:0.090315 |  and brought on Martin Brathwaid,
[3870.08 - 3875.16] P:1551.26 E:0.078155 |  the former Middlesbrough and Barcelona man.
[3875.20 - 3876.88] P:1650.67 E:0.095039 |  Small club that, isn't it?
[3876.88 - 3879.60] P:1749.99 E:0.081838 |  Now playing for Espanyol.
[3879.60 - 3883.56] P:1788.26 E:0.081330 |  I think he had to work very hard, Cornelius,
[3883.56 - 3885.72] P:1849.22 E:0.069956 |  but I think the other factor, isn't it,
[3885.72 - 3888.48] P:1640.82 E:0.104092 |  that Cornelius was on a yellow card and there was that challenge,
[3888.48 - 3889.88] P:1599.59 E:0.072220 |  wasn't there in the second half?
[3889.88 - 3892.32] P:1514.80 E:0.104077 |  You do not want to go down to 10 men against this lot.
[3892.32 - 3895.56] P:1800.14 E:0.089837 |  No, and I also think he'll give them more energy
[3895.56 - 3897.40] P:1732.10 E:0.097830 |  and the ability to run in behind.
[3897.40 - 3899.08] P:1571.77 E:0.107158 |  Which is what France are doing now,
[3899.08 - 3900.88] P:1642.12 E:0.103228 |  and the ball is being carried forward by Dembele,
[3900.88 - 3902.60] P:1728.26 E:0.092158 |  who's taken it a long way, cuts in field,
[3902.60 - 3904.24] P:1705.88 E:0.095897 |  gives it to Mbappe on the left-hand side.
[3904.32 - 3905.88] P:1638.74 E:0.109787 |  He lifts it into the penalty area.
[3905.88 - 3908.12] P:1624.83 E:0.089745 |  Rabiot's in there as well, couldn't get it down.
[3908.12 - 3910.24] P:1818.97 E:0.088350 |  There were defenders in there in the white shirts,
[3910.24 - 3912.44] P:1655.71 E:0.088232 |  and Denmark have been able to work it away.
[3912.44 - 3914.72] P:1691.02 E:0.093484 |  So no changes for France at half-time.
[3914.72 - 3916.96] P:1658.27 E:0.085314 |  Loris Engol, back four of Kunde,
[3916.96 - 3920.48] P:1650.62 E:0.078640 |  Veran, Uppermakano, and Theo Hernandez,
[3920.48 - 3922.64] P:1779.49 E:0.082055 |  then Tua-Mani and Rabiot centrally.
[3922.64 - 3924.96] P:1694.75 E:0.079861 |  Dembele on the right and Bappe on the left,
[3924.96 - 3926.68] P:1820.89 E:0.106067 |  and Griezmann in this free-roll
[3926.68 - 3930.32] P:1870.13 E:0.057332 |  that we've been talking about all evening,
[3930.32 - 3933.80] P:1854.67 E:0.087647 |  with Giroud up front, Olivier Giroud,
[3933.84 - 3936.76] P:1785.71 E:0.083164 |  who needs one goal to become, on his own,
[3936.76 - 3939.60] P:1893.86 E:0.071684 |  France's record scorer.
[3939.60 - 3942.04] P:1894.45 E:0.096252 |  And Denmark, having made that change,
[3942.04 - 3944.56] P:1773.81 E:0.094092 |  Michael Engol, back four of Anderson,
[3944.56 - 3946.56] P:1667.58 E:0.078641 |  Christensen and Nelson,
[3946.56 - 3948.72] P:1580.05 E:0.095131 |  with Rasmus Christensen on the right,
[3948.72 - 3950.00] P:1603.86 E:0.094170 |  Jochen Meiler on the left,
[3950.00 - 3952.20] P:1694.77 E:0.078822 |  Hoibierre and Ericsson in the middle,
[3952.20 - 3955.80] P:1609.27 E:0.093332 |  and then Lindstrom and Damsegaard in the wide areas,
[3955.80 - 3958.84] P:1753.58 E:0.075909 |  with substitute Brathwaite up front.
[3959.72 - 3963.72] P:1736.28 E:0.081144 |  Australia have scored in Cardiff to convert a try,
[3964.00 - 3967.88] P:1805.16 E:0.073392 |  Wales 34, Australia 32,
[3967.88 - 3970.28] P:1760.11 E:0.084543 |  with five minutes to go.
[3970.28 - 3974.24] P:1784.77 E:0.078748 |  So Wales 34, Australia 32,
[3974.24 - 3975.84] P:1669.07 E:0.087022 |  and not long left.
[3975.84 - 3978.36] P:1796.46 E:0.078547 |  England, South Africa kicks off at Twickenham,
[3978.36 - 3980.32] P:1791.95 E:0.081591 |  at 5.30 UK time,
[3980.32 - 3984.04] P:1772.09 E:0.060257 |  and Chris Jones will keep us updated on that.
[3984.04 - 3985.56] P:1608.82 E:0.102622 |  Neil Neil here, France, Neil, Denmark,
[3985.56 - 3987.56] P:1656.54 E:0.088130 |  Neil, remember, France need to win
[3987.56 - 3990.52] P:1709.08 E:0.077357 |  to confirm their place in the last 16.
[3990.52 - 3991.96] P:1521.91 E:0.099984 |  Ball back to Rabiot,
[3991.96 - 3994.16] P:1606.31 E:0.085605 |  but Rabiot is going to be dispossessed, he is.
[3994.16 - 3995.92] P:1509.20 E:0.099786 |  And it's a battling Hoibierre,
[3995.92 - 3998.28] P:1643.05 E:0.097506 |  who takes it away from him and then passes it forward,
[3998.28 - 4001.80] P:1768.82 E:0.065082 |  but Lindstrom won't reach that defender,
[4001.80 - 4005.48] P:1583.66 E:0.074367 |  Hernandez was there to see it back to Lloris.
[4005.48 - 4007.40] P:1580.16 E:0.094524 |  Denmark start again with Hoibierre,
[4007.40 - 4011.24] P:1803.80 E:0.090837 |  Ericsson helps it forward towards the newly arrived Brathwaite.
[4011.24 - 4014.24] P:1693.10 E:0.083730 |  Then the balls played to the left-hand side to Meiler.
[4014.24 - 4016.72] P:1755.72 E:0.097496 |  Then a little ball back to Ericsson, finding the space.
[4016.72 - 4018.76] P:1506.50 E:0.097184 |  Ericsson's ball, that's an excellent ball in,
[4018.76 - 4020.76] P:1773.78 E:0.092320 |  but beyond Brathwaite and through,
[4020.76 - 4024.00] P:1808.91 E:0.080876 |  and beyond the six-yard box and the far post for Golcic.
[4024.00 - 4026.88] P:1752.40 E:0.085677 |  That's a really, really clever ball from Chrisian Ericsson there.
[4026.88 - 4029.40] P:1755.13 E:0.102946 |  He just picks his head up and whips that in with his left foot,
[4029.40 - 4032.96] P:1743.09 E:0.096092 |  and he's crying out for someone to get on the end of that.
[4032.96 - 4035.44] P:1723.90 E:0.093126 |  And Brathwaite, who's just come on at half-time,
[4035.44 - 4037.84] P:1658.08 E:0.102210 |  wasn't alive to it, was he? It was an excellent ball in.
[4037.84 - 4040.24] P:1720.74 E:0.084600 |  That's classic Chrisian Ericsson that, wasn't it?
[4040.24 - 4043.80] P:1819.08 E:0.074248 |  You know, sometimes football can be so simple,
[4043.80 - 4046.60] P:1737.42 E:0.085394 |  and there, Ericsson just found the space.
[4046.60 - 4050.40] P:1764.60 E:0.088360 |  Well, a cross like that deserves someone to be on the end of it,
[4050.44 - 4053.32] P:1665.19 E:0.094126 |  and he must be asking to himself this, and, come on,
[4053.32 - 4054.68] P:1733.57 E:0.104712 |  there's not much more I can do there.
[4054.68 - 4058.24] P:1598.18 E:0.066113 |  Put the ball into the danger area, get on the end of it.
[4058.24 - 4060.16] P:1582.14 E:0.076424 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill.
[4060.16 - 4064.80] P:1733.68 E:0.073114 |  Five-live and BBC Sounds, as we heard from Ali and Chris.
[4064.80 - 4066.88] P:1598.89 E:0.094408 |  Argentina, Mexico coming up.
[4066.88 - 4070.52] P:1564.49 E:0.085734 |  That's a seven-o'clock UK time, and more live sport after that,
[4070.52 - 4073.56] P:1832.45 E:0.081482 |  because the Dillion White-Germain-Franklin fight
[4073.56 - 4078.68] P:1629.08 E:0.074455 |  is live on Five-Live Tonight from Wembley at 10 o'clock.
[4078.72 - 4083.04] P:1768.98 E:0.073224 |  So, almost from dawn to dusk, here come Denmark,
[4083.04 - 4085.28] P:1795.23 E:0.090335 |  through the middle with the run.
[4085.28 - 4089.40] P:1842.15 E:0.095430 |  It is from Lindstrom, but he just runs into blue shirts
[4089.40 - 4091.52] P:1442.11 E:0.098397 |  on the edge of the penalty area and loses possession,
[4091.52 - 4096.36] P:1688.28 E:0.084881 |  but here is the short blonde-haired Chris Dinson on the right-hand side,
[4096.36 - 4099.72] P:1854.61 E:0.068675 |  winning a throw-in off Hernandez,
[4099.72 - 4102.48] P:1736.92 E:0.092461 |  throw-in five or six yards away from the corner flag,
[4102.48 - 4105.96] P:1662.50 E:0.083425 |  takes it quickly, runs up, gets the ball into the penalty area,
[4105.96 - 4108.12] P:1614.28 E:0.085800 |  but France win it back, Rabiol wins it back,
[4108.16 - 4111.20] P:1737.22 E:0.093738 |  and then Griezmann lifts it forward to Mbappe,
[4111.20 - 4113.88] P:1640.39 E:0.092326 |  and Mbappe with that golden number 10 on his back,
[4113.88 - 4116.52] P:1478.77 E:0.101946 |  is away with the ball down the left-hand side, defenders are with him,
[4116.52 - 4120.00] P:1722.29 E:0.077474 |  two of them, Denmark have got with the great man,
[4120.00 - 4123.04] P:1624.33 E:0.102473 |  and Mbappe is crossing into Dembele, who lifts it back,
[4123.04 - 4125.00] P:1782.22 E:0.099989 |  and Mbappe was almost in.
[4125.00 - 4127.00] P:1739.97 E:0.107506 |  Oh, the lightness of touch there was brilliant,
[4127.00 - 4130.08] P:1612.61 E:0.098327 |  but Schmeichel was able to come out and grab it on the edge of the six-yard box.
[4130.08 - 4131.20] P:1789.24 E:0.089153 |  It was a really clever play.
[4131.20 - 4134.88] P:1591.61 E:0.098940 |  First of all, the pass from Griezmann, the first time passing to Mbappe,
[4134.88 - 4137.44] P:1824.96 E:0.094290 |  which sets him off down this left-hand side,
[4137.44 - 4140.44] P:1863.05 E:0.099573 |  and he cuts in on his right foot, and he's looking for some support,
[4140.44 - 4143.92] P:1905.40 E:0.092681 |  and Dembele comes all the way across, and he fizzes it into him,
[4143.92 - 4146.36] P:1682.55 E:0.099133 |  and he tries to play that little one-two,
[4146.36 - 4148.60] P:1803.83 E:0.082250 |  but just that much pace on the ball,
[4148.60 - 4150.80] P:1630.62 E:0.060630 |  actually, Schmeichel comes out and collects it.
[4150.80 - 4153.20] P:1784.66 E:0.076872 |  Feels like a real treat, this, actually,
[4153.20 - 4155.12] P:1432.40 E:0.089077 |  with some of the talent that is out there,
[4155.12 - 4158.64] P:1760.85 E:0.088128 |  and it feels like, even though we've not seen any goals tonight,
[4158.64 - 4161.00] P:1697.15 E:0.079132 |  it feels like they're in the mood tonight,
[4161.00 - 4165.20] P:1611.69 E:0.078933 |  and some of those touches in there from Mbappe and Dembele,
[4165.24 - 4167.52] P:1752.61 E:0.080653 |  while Ericsson at the other end, as we mentioned,
[4167.52 - 4169.52] P:1593.59 E:0.090212 |  here is Brathwaite through the middle.
[4169.52 - 4172.52] P:1598.91 E:0.095692 |  Brathwaite, the number nine, plays it into Voran, who's chasing after it.
[4172.52 - 4174.24] P:1627.20 E:0.103984 |  He won't reach it, it bounces away from him.
[4174.24 - 4176.60] P:1769.29 E:0.090903 |  It's like watching a fielder who couldn't get to the ball
[4176.60 - 4179.04] P:1751.93 E:0.076644 |  that was crossing the boundary rope. It's a corner.
[4180.04 - 4182.68] P:1617.12 E:0.076053 |  It's a good play, that. Really good play from Brathwaite.
[4182.68 - 4185.12] P:1873.46 E:0.080906 |  He tries to hit the ball into the run,
[4185.12 - 4186.72] P:1858.12 E:0.114614 |  and Lindstrom, who's running behind him,
[4186.72 - 4189.84] P:1629.89 E:0.088215 |  but takes that deflection off Voran, and they get a corner out of it.
[4189.84 - 4194.40] P:1701.52 E:0.071436 |  Yeah, corner. So, not the perfect metaphor, cricket,
[4194.44 - 4196.72] P:1599.37 E:0.088252 |  when you're commentating on France, Denmark,
[4196.72 - 4199.96] P:1646.01 E:0.081034 |  but I'm sure that listeners at home will know what I mean.
[4200.72 - 4204.16] P:1787.69 E:0.084443 |  The corner from the right. Ericsson to take this.
[4204.16 - 4208.08] P:1793.32 E:0.086399 |  Be quite the shock if Denmark took the lead. Set peace chance.
[4208.80 - 4210.56] P:1520.87 E:0.092634 |  Ericsson stands off the field.
[4210.56 - 4212.92] P:1709.85 E:0.095078 |  They're yet to score their first goal at this World Cup.
[4213.76 - 4217.08] P:1561.20 E:0.083184 |  Ericsson driving in deep this one towards the back post,
[4217.08 - 4218.44] P:1626.39 E:0.093798 |  and it's headed across by Christensen,
[4218.44 - 4222.60] P:1795.53 E:0.095460 |  but Loris is able to come and catch it comfortably above the head of Brathwaite,
[4222.64 - 4224.48] P:1778.48 E:0.092007 |  who pretty much stayed on the ground, actually,
[4224.48 - 4228.08] P:1628.73 E:0.091582 |  and the French goalkeeper had the ball safely, and there was black gloves at his.
[4228.08 - 4229.76] P:1656.90 E:0.086972 |  Yeah, there was no trouble there for him.
[4229.76 - 4232.44] P:1807.14 E:0.100873 |  The header of the far post was too high,
[4232.44 - 4235.12] P:1676.10 E:0.092847 |  and it invited the goalkeeper to come and get it,
[4235.12 - 4237.88] P:1814.42 E:0.075823 |  and that's exactly what Loris did problem over.
[4237.88 - 4240.60] P:1731.20 E:0.064473 |  That's the voice of Alan Shearer with us.
[4240.60 - 4243.84] P:1773.05 E:0.070771 |  Special guest on Five Live for this match.
[4243.84 - 4246.40] P:1504.30 E:0.078086 |  I presume we'll be hearing you as the tournament continues.
[4246.40 - 4248.20] P:1744.35 E:0.089254 |  Haven't been called special for a while, John.
[4248.20 - 4249.76] P:1705.20 E:0.069680 |  Special. Special.
[4249.76 - 4252.36] P:1618.89 E:0.097867 |  Just expecting guest. I wasn't expecting special.
[4253.56 - 4256.32] P:1674.13 E:0.098398 |  Only special people are called special.
[4256.32 - 4258.44] P:1769.19 E:0.076133 |  I feel like working with you. It's fine.
[4258.44 - 4260.48] P:1782.20 E:0.104992 |  You and Jose Mourinho.
[4261.48 - 4262.80] P:1585.22 E:0.090420 |  You're the special one.
[4263.40 - 4265.84] P:1571.52 E:0.097703 |  And Kevin Keegan, of course, special K himself.
[4265.84 - 4266.80] P:1774.74 E:0.045417 |  Absolutely.
[4266.80 - 4269.72] P:1656.24 E:0.076302 |  France, Nill, Denmark, Nill.
[4269.72 - 4273.12] P:1665.83 E:0.084531 |  As France play the ball back deep into their own half.
[4273.76 - 4276.00] P:1571.55 E:0.091572 |  I suppose, which one are you doing tomorrow then?
[4276.64 - 4279.24] P:1718.52 E:0.092992 |  Japan, Costa Rica, Belgium, Morocco, Croatia, Canada,
[4279.24 - 4280.20] P:1894.27 E:0.106873 |  or Spain, Germany.
[4280.20 - 4281.96] P:1543.86 E:0.060668 |  Spain, Germany. I thought you might be.
[4281.96 - 4283.20] P:1428.43 E:0.094106 |  Yes, I'm there. It's a big one.
[4283.20 - 4285.24] P:1661.70 E:0.101918 |  Yes, we've got a special guest for that tomorrow night.
[4285.24 - 4289.08] P:1712.73 E:0.071930 |  Peter Schmeichel is with us tomorrow night.
[4289.08 - 4290.44] P:1742.89 E:0.106107 |  The ball played forward for France.
[4290.44 - 4292.48] P:1690.47 E:0.089315 |  Griezmann was way offside.
[4292.48 - 4294.88] P:1628.76 E:0.060859 |  I don't know why he kept running, frankly.
[4294.88 - 4296.96] P:1509.29 E:0.084168 |  Denmark stepped up, and it's a free kick.
[4296.96 - 4299.20] P:1539.42 E:0.075370 |  The Denmark halfway inside their own half.
[4299.20 - 4301.80] P:1658.70 E:0.098991 |  So Denmark's still looking for, as I say, their first goal.
[4301.80 - 4305.32] P:1819.83 E:0.069835 |  They've got their first point from the draw against Tunisia,
[4305.32 - 4308.96] P:1754.68 E:0.086850 |  but it would be nervous going into their final match, Denmark,
[4308.96 - 4312.88] P:1658.47 E:0.092543 |  against Australia, who I imagine will have taken great heart
[4312.88 - 4316.80] P:1714.99 E:0.070258 |  from what they were able to do today to get their win.
[4316.80 - 4322.08] P:1748.22 E:0.050774 |  So that is all on Wednesday night.
[4322.08 - 4325.04] P:1576.29 E:0.093527 |  And Denmark coming forward with Mailer on the left-hand side,
[4325.04 - 4328.88] P:1817.18 E:0.067968 |  but just runs into Kunde.
[4328.88 - 4332.16] P:1567.56 E:0.094636 |  And so, Dembele plays it forward, looking for the run of Mbappe.
[4332.16 - 4333.76] P:1624.48 E:0.083326 |  But Schmeichel was quickly onto that.
[4333.80 - 4336.64] P:1676.36 E:0.088875 |  It's kind of telegraphed by Dembele on the halfway line, actually,
[4336.64 - 4340.20] P:1781.67 E:0.081816 |  and even though Mbappe used his pace, Schmeichel was quickly out.
[4340.20 - 4342.72] P:1678.91 E:0.086732 |  That was another incident in the first half, by the way,
[4342.72 - 4348.00] P:1656.84 E:0.061600 |  when Andreas Christensen pulled back on Mbappe
[4348.00 - 4349.80] P:1556.28 E:0.095342 |  when he was running forward from the centre-circle,
[4349.80 - 4352.36] P:1559.08 E:0.079538 |  but there were defenders either side, so it was just a yellow card.
[4352.36 - 4355.80] P:1688.24 E:0.059489 |  He has Brathwaite playing it back into his own half.
[4355.80 - 4358.80] P:1815.25 E:0.096334 |  Just did that run. He just comes off that left-hand side on Mbappe.
[4358.80 - 4362.64] P:1756.53 E:0.081308 |  Because he's got the freedom to go basically where he wants,
[4362.68 - 4366.92] P:1881.16 E:0.097466 |  he actually ran past Giroud and then looked to where to get in behind.
[4366.92 - 4368.24] P:1790.07 E:0.102129 |  I think you should do that more often,
[4368.24 - 4371.12] P:1844.55 E:0.082222 |  because that's a way that I think Franz can get in behind
[4371.12 - 4374.12] P:1563.23 E:0.072120 |  with the ability of Griezmann and his passes.
[4374.12 - 4378.16] P:1725.37 E:0.073377 |  Franz Niel, Denmark Niel, very warm in the stadium.
[4378.16 - 4380.76] P:1625.06 E:0.074886 |  It's almost as warm as any stadium I've been in yet,
[4380.76 - 4384.44] P:1764.69 E:0.075521 |  but I just feel, maybe, the effect of the air conditioning
[4384.44 - 4388.96] P:1821.53 E:0.078398 |  coming into play as Ericsson now, short hair, looks up,
[4388.96 - 4391.16] P:1821.50 E:0.070589 |  looks to his left, gives it to his right,
[4391.16 - 4395.44] P:1701.52 E:0.078433 |  and then the pass in towards the edge of the area for Brathwaite,
[4395.44 - 4396.44] P:1817.56 E:0.095462 |  who takes it away.
[4396.44 - 4398.84] P:1792.55 E:0.089553 |  It was Damsegaard who popped up on the right-hand side,
[4398.84 - 4401.32] P:1756.26 E:0.098290 |  and Brathwaite has been able, with that turn,
[4401.32 - 4403.16] P:1599.78 E:0.089492 |  as the challenge came in to win another corner.
[4403.16 - 4407.12] P:1791.85 E:0.104689 |  That's what he's given them already in the nine or 10 minutes
[4407.12 - 4408.40] P:1619.12 E:0.097826 |  of being playing in the second half.
[4408.40 - 4411.52] P:1822.93 E:0.092066 |  There's just been two or three occasions where he's had that threat
[4411.52 - 4414.16] P:1783.57 E:0.096107 |  and that pace and that ability to run in behind
[4414.16 - 4417.40] P:1750.75 E:0.083657 |  just gives the French defenders something else to think about.
[4417.40 - 4419.64] P:1558.53 E:0.088210 |  31 years old now, Brathwaite,
[4419.68 - 4421.88] P:1764.09 E:0.087113 |  coming on as a substitute at halftime.
[4421.88 - 4424.48] P:1774.17 E:0.081755 |  Ericsson with this corner then, from the right,
[4424.48 - 4427.04] P:1805.23 E:0.065194 |  just waiting to take it, and...
[4428.16 - 4428.96] P:1858.36 E:0.100765 |  Steady weights.
[4428.96 - 4432.04] P:1555.62 E:0.085979 |  Now, the corner from Ericsson, this also to the back post,
[4432.04 - 4433.72] P:1653.95 E:0.083665 |  but Rabiot was able to get there.
[4433.72 - 4436.88] P:1662.15 E:0.092075 |  It's helped back into the box, taken down by Brathwaite.
[4436.88 - 4438.76] P:1767.86 E:0.093251 |  In comes the challenge, double deflection,
[4438.76 - 4440.40] P:1777.93 E:0.092133 |  but the offside flag is up,
[4440.40 - 4443.20] P:1759.75 E:0.080438 |  and I actually think everyone in the penalty area knew
[4443.20 - 4444.36] P:1616.31 E:0.062582 |  that it was coming.
[4444.36 - 4447.40] P:1767.42 E:0.068333 |  They helped Brathwaite then, because his touch was terrible.
[4447.44 - 4451.72] P:1854.43 E:0.058777 |  So it's a free kick to France.
[4451.72 - 4452.84] P:1899.75 E:0.065095 |  Clearly offside, he was.
[4452.84 - 4454.00] P:1899.59 E:0.093390 |  Two or three yards offside.
[4454.00 - 4455.80] P:1751.33 E:0.083920 |  He was a good job, because he tried to take the touch
[4455.80 - 4458.20] P:1652.83 E:0.085804 |  with his right foot and it bounced about three yards off it.
[4458.20 - 4462.64] P:1650.70 E:0.067205 |  Yeah, you know what I was saying about some of the delightful touches?
[4462.64 - 4465.72] P:1623.83 E:0.053577 |  That wasn't one of them.
[4465.72 - 4469.56] P:1759.34 E:0.067299 |  Tuamene now playing it to the right-hand side.
[4469.56 - 4473.76] P:1768.85 E:0.068699 |  And a ball in field from Kunde,
[4473.80 - 4478.36] P:1662.14 E:0.073251 |  which just presents possession back to Denmark.
[4478.36 - 4480.68] P:1600.71 E:0.096206 |  And now Christensen on the right-hand side.
[4480.68 - 4483.88] P:1757.48 E:0.090169 |  The run is continued, and that's a decent cross
[4483.88 - 4485.56] P:1440.58 E:0.099069 |  from the right-hand side from Damsegaard,
[4485.56 - 4487.68] P:1789.01 E:0.051219 |  but it was blocked actually.
[4487.68 - 4490.52] P:1772.25 E:0.075840 |  I thought it was going to fall behind up on McCarno,
[4490.52 - 4491.68] P:1646.63 E:0.083374 |  but he was able to check himself.
[4491.68 - 4494.16] P:1664.39 E:0.095488 |  Now Griezmann wins the ball back from Christensen,
[4494.16 - 4496.60] P:1862.79 E:0.083980 |  just speed of foot, really.
[4496.60 - 4499.96] P:1771.12 E:0.103092 |  Mbappe turns, and he's got away from Anderson.
[4499.96 - 4502.88] P:1746.64 E:0.108586 |  Brilliant from Mbappe, approaching the penalty area now.
[4503.68 - 4505.76] P:1771.47 E:0.106730 |  Schmeichel is able to just push it up.
[4505.76 - 4508.92] P:1769.71 E:0.105058 |  It was just above him to his right, just got his gloves up there.
[4508.92 - 4511.32] P:1686.29 E:0.098749 |  He almost let it hit his gloves and deflect wide.
[4511.32 - 4513.60] P:1826.47 E:0.087395 |  Superb play from Mbappe.
[4513.60 - 4517.04] P:1823.26 E:0.106984 |  Right inside his own half, the touch to turn the defender,
[4517.04 - 4519.68] P:1861.98 E:0.096776 |  then another touch to actually get away from him.
[4519.68 - 4522.88] P:1938.00 E:0.102153 |  And he's waiting for Giroud to run in behind him, which he does,
[4522.88 - 4526.68] P:1883.57 E:0.101121 |  and he's hoping that it might just open up to go on his left foot.
[4526.68 - 4528.00] P:1774.62 E:0.079909 |  And he has that shot.
[4528.00 - 4531.36] P:1725.03 E:0.092053 |  Superb pace to get him into that position to have the shot he'd go.
[4531.36 - 4532.76] P:1501.25 E:0.102298 |  It doesn't get much better than that.
[4532.76 - 4534.60] P:1452.08 E:0.102224 |  I think watching football at the highest level
[4534.60 - 4536.80] P:1581.52 E:0.093838 |  to see something like that, a moment like that,
[4536.80 - 4539.76] P:1768.23 E:0.079770 |  from a player like that, who is just...
[4539.76 - 4542.28] P:1728.38 E:0.094797 |  It just glides along, doesn't it, with ease?
[4542.28 - 4544.56] P:1576.99 E:0.101683 |  Conat Griezmann to take it to the near post.
[4544.56 - 4545.56] P:1601.08 E:0.072996 |  Doesn't beat the first man.
[4545.56 - 4548.48] P:1702.01 E:0.087148 |  Christensen was able just to watch it onto his forehead
[4548.48 - 4550.32] P:1771.19 E:0.049498 |  and nod it out of play.
[4550.32 - 4552.96] P:1537.32 E:0.094588 |  There's been a dramatic end to the Autumn International
[4552.96 - 4555.44] P:1625.35 E:0.102421 |  in Cardiff. Gareth Lewis, tell us all.
[4555.44 - 4556.28] P:1793.50 E:0.088791 |  Would you believe it?
[4556.28 - 4559.88] P:1760.04 E:0.106311 |  Wales 34, Australia 39.
[4559.88 - 4564.00] P:1794.16 E:0.098227 |  Wales on top for 50 minutes, fell apart in the last half an hour.
[4564.00 - 4567.80] P:1676.34 E:0.103461 |  Lachlan Lonergan with a try that might well bring an end
[4567.80 - 4570.32] P:1641.80 E:0.116692 |  to Wayne Pivak's role as Wales head coach.
[4570.32 - 4572.12] P:1684.49 E:0.112579 |  This was Australia's second.
[4572.12 - 4575.68] P:1359.20 E:0.098022 |  Wales 34, Australia 39.
[4575.68 - 4577.44] P:1445.42 E:0.096625 |  Australia winning it at the end.
[4577.44 - 4579.92] P:1707.80 E:0.062432 |  What a week for Wales.
[4579.92 - 4585.88] P:1763.19 E:0.073680 |  What they need is, Tuesday night, a big win to put everything right.
[4585.88 - 4589.00] P:1953.79 E:0.087948 |  Join us for that on the BBC.
[4590.88 - 4594.72] P:1886.43 E:0.092238 |  France with the ball at the back, still 0-0 here,
[4594.72 - 4597.24] P:1838.46 E:0.084898 |  with just over half an hour to play.
[4597.24 - 4600.84] P:1733.44 E:0.082507 |  Denmark have played really well tonight.
[4600.84 - 4604.00] P:1794.52 E:0.072569 |  I mean, France have really had their moments,
[4604.00 - 4606.44] P:1775.30 E:0.056896 |  but Denmark have stood up to it.
[4606.44 - 4611.24] P:1717.60 E:0.052691 |  They've not let themselves be rattled, not panicked.
[4611.24 - 4614.12] P:1735.68 E:0.077552 |  And it is France with the ball on the right-hand side.
[4614.12 - 4618.48] P:1679.17 E:0.059200 |  Griezmann plays it back into his own half, and France start again.
[4618.72 - 4622.40] P:1687.06 E:0.092347 |  Another well-coached team, which is what Gareth Southgate said
[4622.40 - 4625.16] P:1417.79 E:0.081977 |  about the United States last night and Greg Behrholter.
[4625.16 - 4628.52] P:1470.29 E:0.074025 |  And I think that's another part of the story from last night.
[4628.52 - 4631.20] P:1544.99 E:0.081776 |  I think you've got to accept that with the ability that France have
[4631.20 - 4634.44] P:1775.33 E:0.085418 |  in forward positions, you can't keep them out all the time.
[4634.44 - 4636.84] P:1738.27 E:0.091765 |  And when they've been caught out defensively,
[4636.84 - 4638.80] P:1616.11 E:0.097688 |  they've had the goalkeeper to rely on.
[4638.80 - 4641.00] P:1867.83 E:0.092926 |  So I think the manager will be pretty pleased with the way
[4641.00 - 4644.92] P:1798.03 E:0.083350 |  they've handled themselves and how difficult they've made it for France.
[4645.92 - 4649.56] P:1655.88 E:0.071145 |  As Tumani looks up and plays the ball out to the right-hand side,
[4649.56 - 4651.52] P:1750.26 E:0.078938 |  Dan Belly, he gets it down.
[4651.52 - 4655.08] P:1707.44 E:0.087277 |  Now running at the Danish defence on his left foot,
[4655.08 - 4657.84] P:1698.69 E:0.104532 |  plays it across, and Bapé went for a flick on the edge of the box,
[4657.84 - 4660.84] P:1670.90 E:0.091534 |  but there were two men there, and between them they were able to block it.
[4660.84 - 4665.20] P:1791.18 E:0.057737 |  It was Christensen and Hoibje,
[4665.20 - 4668.00] P:1928.00 E:0.091297 |  but he was trying the extravagant there.
[4668.00 - 4673.20] P:1727.87 E:0.082531 |  And Bapé came to him, it was one of those flicks with the one foot behind the other,
[4673.48 - 4676.68] P:1624.43 E:0.087168 |  with the inside of his heel, and it nearly came off.
[4676.68 - 4678.68] P:1639.62 E:0.084883 |  If it had, I mean, it would have been a classic,
[4678.68 - 4680.68] P:1531.30 E:0.079692 |  it would have been burkamp-like, actually.
[4680.68 - 4683.68] P:1646.29 E:0.081139 |  It was such a clever little free, you'd see what he's trying to do.
[4683.68 - 4686.68] P:1797.03 E:0.114892 |  Here's one for Griezmann, Chester Downey's away from Nelson,
[4686.68 - 4689.20] P:1731.48 E:0.090999 |  and he places the shot over the bar.
[4689.20 - 4692.40] P:1750.74 E:0.089508 |  And it lands in that little entrance area,
[4692.40 - 4695.68] P:1647.70 E:0.093753 |  that is halfway up the lower tier of the stand,
[4695.68 - 4697.56] P:1631.25 E:0.085696 |  and rattles around in there,
[4697.56 - 4699.08] P:1397.70 E:0.093993 |  underneath the sign that says,
[4699.08 - 4701.84] P:1689.31 E:0.060004 |  Do Ha.
[4701.84 - 4704.84] P:1747.43 E:0.085265 |  Well, what a run and what a pass.
[4704.84 - 4707.84] P:1670.43 E:0.092526 |  Two superb things that happened, but the third one,
[4707.84 - 4710.84] P:1731.11 E:0.099163 |  it was hopeful, he tries to hit it on the half-volley
[4710.84 - 4713.32] P:1906.63 E:0.090551 |  with his left foot, but he's leaning back,
[4713.32 - 4715.84] P:1756.47 E:0.105156 |  and it goes about 20 yards over the bar, doesn't it?
[4715.84 - 4718.84] P:1519.62 E:0.070329 |  But the pass and the run were magnificent.
[4718.84 - 4725.84] P:1621.48 E:0.073785 |  Griezmann, who has not scored in his last nine internationals,
[4725.84 - 4728.84] P:1807.19 E:0.092997 |  in fact, ten when you add the first game at this World Cup,
[4728.84 - 4730.84] P:1823.00 E:0.062648 |  so this is the eleventh.
[4730.84 - 4734.84] P:1829.30 E:0.071472 |  And that was a glorious opportunity,
[4734.84 - 4737.84] P:1571.56 E:0.086714 |  as the balls played up towards the halfway line,
[4737.84 - 4739.84] P:1706.66 E:0.070609 |  but it bounces back for Denmark,
[4739.84 - 4743.84] P:1704.23 E:0.076101 |  the man who was the golden boot winner at Euro 2016.
[4743.84 - 4747.84] P:1841.74 E:0.098892 |  Four goals, as France won the World Cup four years ago,
[4747.84 - 4749.84] P:1645.04 E:0.076849 |  and Denmark winning the ball back to Ericsson,
[4749.84 - 4751.84] P:1550.03 E:0.084697 |  who plays it in field, and that was most unlike him,
[4751.84 - 4753.84] P:1705.59 E:0.084454 |  a misplace pass to Tua Mane, however,
[4753.84 - 4756.84] P:1614.80 E:0.087474 |  France haven't cleared it yet, but Tua Mane steps in,
[4756.84 - 4758.84] P:1814.94 E:0.102251 |  and that's good play, with the outside of his boot,
[4758.84 - 4760.84] P:1768.00 E:0.103546 |  and he plays it into the space.
[4760.84 - 4762.84] P:1721.21 E:0.092563 |  Now France could be in business.
[4762.84 - 4764.84] P:1729.27 E:0.097761 |  Hernandez forward towards Mbappe,
[4764.84 - 4767.84] P:1688.84 E:0.101756 |  Mbappe now into the penalty area, back to Hernandez.
[4767.84 - 4770.84] P:1906.04 E:0.111096 |  Hernandez angles it back, and Mbappe is there to score.
[4771.84 - 4774.84] P:1880.26 E:0.106887 |  Drives it in from the angle,
[4774.84 - 4777.84] P:1810.39 E:0.114856 |  and France lead by one goal to nil.
[4777.84 - 4781.84] P:1869.39 E:0.103457 |  Absolutely brilliant on the breakaway,
[4781.84 - 4785.84] P:1837.66 E:0.106483 |  and finally they find a way through this Danish defence,
[4785.84 - 4788.84] P:1815.08 E:0.104170 |  and make it France won Denmark nil,
[4788.84 - 4791.84] P:1776.45 E:0.099782 |  and the champions are on course for the last 16.
[4791.84 - 4793.84] P:1712.86 E:0.103957 |  Well, what a goal it was,
[4793.84 - 4796.84] P:1774.11 E:0.106187 |  and no surprise that it comes from the superstar Mbappe.
[4796.84 - 4800.84] P:1696.33 E:0.104071 |  Again, he gets the ball in his own half, and he drives forward.
[4800.84 - 4802.84] P:1674.29 E:0.098005 |  This time he gets the support from Hernandez,
[4802.84 - 4804.84] P:1785.83 E:0.105448 |  and Hernandez runs in behind,
[4804.84 - 4806.84] P:1866.88 E:0.097009 |  and he has a little look around to see,
[4806.84 - 4809.84] P:1782.98 E:0.098667 |  okay, where are you, and he puts it into his path.
[4809.84 - 4812.84] P:1768.62 E:0.083125 |  What a goal, it was perfection.
[4812.84 - 4815.84] P:1796.36 E:0.102771 |  The little pass in from Mbappe, then he follows it,
[4815.84 - 4817.84] P:1867.84 E:0.089162 |  and he takes it away past Schmeichel.
[4817.84 - 4823.84] P:1626.36 E:0.092701 |  I did wonder about offside when Mbappe initially played it through for Hernandez,
[4824.84 - 4827.84] P:1823.68 E:0.090431 |  and we've not restarted yet.
[4828.84 - 4833.84] P:1917.28 E:0.093042 |  It just takes a little deflection as well in front of Kasper Schmeichel there,
[4833.84 - 4836.84] P:1915.93 E:0.092323 |  because he's standing up, expecting it to go to him,
[4836.84 - 4839.84] P:1949.69 E:0.084996 |  and that little deflection just takes it past him,
[4839.84 - 4841.84] P:1958.02 E:0.103199 |  but it's going to be tight with Hernandez,
[4841.84 - 4843.84] P:1944.65 E:0.096193 |  because the way he runs in behind.
[4843.84 - 4846.84] P:1737.58 E:0.090839 |  It's not said yet on the screen that they're checking for this,
[4846.84 - 4851.84] P:1718.89 E:0.100480 |  the play has not restarted, there's been a change as well.
[4851.84 - 4854.84] P:1601.10 E:0.100333 |  I think Giroud is coming off, yes he is.
[4854.84 - 4856.84] P:1565.96 E:0.106768 |  So, friends, did he a day shot,
[4856.84 - 4858.84] P:1505.38 E:0.099881 |  having seen his team take the lead,
[4858.84 - 4861.84] P:1693.90 E:0.111685 |  he's going to substitute Olivier Giroud,
[4861.84 - 4866.84] P:1622.99 E:0.103115 |  and bring on Marcus Kuran, again, just as he did in the first match,
[4866.84 - 4870.84] P:1756.91 E:0.092840 |  and the goal stands, as far as I can see it,
[4870.84 - 4876.84] P:1750.14 E:0.077817 |  if they've had a look at that, there was no indication that he was offside,
[4876.84 - 4881.84] P:1678.81 E:0.092885 |  so the goal stands, well finished by Mbappe from the angle on the left-hand side,
[4881.84 - 4884.84] P:1611.80 E:0.093353 |  from what, maybe eight or nine yards or so,
[4884.84 - 4886.84] P:1695.95 E:0.092408 |  little deflection as Alan Shearer said,
[4886.84 - 4889.84] P:1671.79 E:0.096206 |  and France lead Denmark by one goal to nil,
[4889.84 - 4894.84] P:1657.13 E:0.080945 |  and Mbappe has scored in both France's matches at this World Cup.
[4894.84 - 4898.84] P:1876.42 E:0.095610 |  Well, John, I was lucky enough to be in the stadium a few days ago,
[4898.84 - 4902.84] P:1844.05 E:0.092806 |  when France played Australia and got a close-up, another view of Mbappe then,
[4902.84 - 4906.84] P:1858.69 E:0.099875 |  and his movement, and his technique, and he's running with and without the ball.
[4906.84 - 4909.84] P:2008.79 E:0.097606 |  As I said earlier, he's almost impossible to stop.
[4909.84 - 4911.84] P:1974.59 E:0.094732 |  When he's running at you as a defender,
[4911.84 - 4916.84] P:1874.20 E:0.091717 |  and he's got grass to attack in behind, the way he stops you, stops the defender,
[4916.84 - 4921.84] P:1890.89 E:0.090175 |  then that gives him that extra three or four yards to get away from his marker,
[4921.84 - 4926.84] P:1918.90 E:0.085886 |  that's exactly what he did, again there, and great support from his left back in,
[4926.84 - 4930.84] P:1977.19 E:0.103275 |  in Hernandez, the way he plays that little one-two with him into the space,
[4930.84 - 4932.84] P:1780.01 E:0.082237 |  and he finishes off really clever.
[4932.84 - 4937.84] P:1739.63 E:0.068251 |  And the thing is, that breakaway, and you have to give praise as well,
[4937.84 - 4942.84] P:1707.58 E:0.086656 |  I think to Tua Meney was, wasn't it, almost in his own right-back position,
[4942.84 - 4947.84] P:1869.64 E:0.079819 |  as France were struggling to get the ball away, Tua Meney took control,
[4947.84 - 4950.84] P:1609.23 E:0.091949 |  played the ball into space with a lovely pass with the outside of his boot,
[4950.84 - 4955.84] P:1648.69 E:0.081891 |  and from that point on, what happened was that for one of the first times in the match,
[4955.84 - 4962.84] P:1676.94 E:0.083617 |  Denmark didn't have numbers back, and France therefore were able to eventually find a way through.
[4962.84 - 4966.84] P:1834.61 E:0.093257 |  That was because they had a little bit more of the game, a little bit more of the ball,
[4966.84 - 4972.84] P:1860.09 E:0.093763 |  and they felt that their confidence was growing, that they could actually put and commit more men forward.
[4972.84 - 4976.84] P:1859.14 E:0.085318 |  In doing that, they've left themselves wide open at the back when they've lost that ball,
[4976.84 - 4978.84] P:1682.34 E:0.081945 |  and they've been punished for it.
[4978.84 - 4982.84] P:1644.57 E:0.081622 |  Well, there had to be goals or goals in this match, there couldn't be another Niel Niel.
[4982.84 - 4985.84] P:1645.94 E:0.096535 |  Well, I said that before the game, and I was thinking, goodness me,
[4985.84 - 4988.84] P:1850.56 E:0.092462 |  I hope someone scores here, you might not invite me back.
[4988.84 - 4990.84] P:1741.57 E:0.049629 |  But you're special.
[4992.84 - 4996.84] P:1715.36 E:0.070140 |  France leading Denmark by one goal to Niel.
[4996.84 - 5001.84] P:1820.25 E:0.066199 |  And it's a throwing for France to the halfway line, Tua Ram chested off,
[5001.84 - 5004.84] P:1767.93 E:0.104017 |  and Bapé plays it over the top, Tua Ram on the chase,
[5004.84 - 5010.84] P:1644.17 E:0.100060 |  well that night the Bienefal, as the defender, it was Hoibier, actually leaned into him,
[5010.84 - 5016.84] P:1754.49 E:0.077947 |  and Tua Ram actually tried to keep his feet, which probably meant he didn't get the free kick.
[5016.84 - 5019.84] P:1747.79 E:0.082807 |  It's a good play of Hoibier, he knew exactly what he was doing,
[5019.84 - 5023.84] P:1872.41 E:0.087531 |  he just nudged him that little bit, didn't he, to put him off his stride,
[5023.84 - 5027.84] P:1771.67 E:0.092590 |  and that's exactly what happened. If he didn't, he was away, clean through on goal.
[5029.84 - 5032.84] P:1904.56 E:0.096826 |  Fair enough to make that change to Dier Deschamps,
[5032.84 - 5039.84] P:1741.89 E:0.083593 |  they've got the lead, they've got their noses in front, and Olivier Giroud at the age of 36, straight off the field.
[5039.84 - 5045.84] P:1808.09 E:0.092299 |  Absolutely, he knows he can't play every minute of every game, he hasn't been at his best this evening,
[5045.84 - 5048.84] P:1751.54 E:0.097841 |  one or two balls have gone up to him and bounced it off him,
[5048.84 - 5052.84] P:1768.36 E:0.106348 |  and then the manager thought, no I'm going to change this, even though we've gone 1-0 up,
[5052.84 - 5054.84] P:1659.33 E:0.077976 |  and got every right to do that.
[5054.84 - 5061.84] P:1630.26 E:0.082909 |  So Marcus Tua Ram is on for his fifth cap, son of Lillian, the famous Lillian Tua Ram.
[5062.84 - 5071.84] P:1595.65 E:0.085745 |  And he has yet to score for France, so he's taken the place of the man who scored, well, more goals,
[5071.84 - 5077.84] P:1572.57 E:0.088297 |  than everyone else apart from Thierry Henry for France, and incidentally on that list,
[5077.84 - 5089.84] P:1737.86 E:0.076565 |  that is Mbappe now to 30, so 30 goals in now 61 internationals, so he is currently 21 behind the joint record.
[5089.84 - 5096.84] P:1754.01 E:0.072832 |  No pressure for Marcus Tua Ram, then, and having a father like he did, and then replacing Olivier Giroud
[5096.84 - 5099.84] P:1796.47 E:0.098097 |  front France's joint record goal scorer.
[5099.84 - 5102.84] P:1693.49 E:0.111631 |  That's lovely play by Lindstrom, who plays the ball into the French penalty area,
[5102.84 - 5107.84] P:1784.15 E:0.097642 |  struggling to get it away, had actually hit, Veran, bounced down, could have gone anywhere,
[5107.84 - 5112.84] P:1760.23 E:0.094427 |  and they were fortunate that it fell to a blue shirt, and Denmark suddenly trying to up it again.
[5113.84 - 5119.84] P:1704.85 E:0.077835 |  Brathwaite putting himself about, and keeping possession though, that's important for Denmark,
[5119.84 - 5122.84] P:1601.24 E:0.082025 |  and they go back towards the halfway line.
[5122.84 - 5127.84] P:1627.53 E:0.085073 |  So Denmark losing, or facing the situation where, by, talk about this win,
[5127.84 - 5132.84] P:1703.99 E:0.088072 |  if it were to be a win taking France through, Denmark would be left with one point after two matches,
[5132.84 - 5140.84] P:1706.06 E:0.070190 |  and up against Australia on Wednesday for a place, as they do come forward again though.
[5140.84 - 5144.84] P:1686.13 E:0.093314 |  The ball's driven across by Lindstrom into the penalty area, blocked by a defender, comes back to him,
[5144.84 - 5149.84] P:1631.92 E:0.083057 |  but either the ball was out of play, in fact it was off the defender and behind for a corner,
[5149.84 - 5151.84] P:1570.95 E:0.075593 |  so it's a corner to Denmark from the right.
[5151.84 - 5155.84] P:1830.63 E:0.094764 |  Yeah, he just runs off Rabiot, who lets him run in behind Lindstrom, and then he's free,
[5155.84 - 5159.84] P:1736.11 E:0.095682 |  he's got all the time in the world to pick his head up and try and pick someone out,
[5159.84 - 5163.84] P:1658.18 E:0.080278 |  but again, Upermenko gets that ball away.
[5163.84 - 5164.84] P:1723.97 E:0.076711 |  Corner though.
[5164.84 - 5169.84] P:1733.17 E:0.087473 |  Ericsson has wandered across there to take it, you know, it feels like with that goal that they've conceded,
[5169.84 - 5175.84] P:1838.64 E:0.087628 |  really, realisation is done here, Denmark, the situation could look quite serious for them tonight.
[5175.84 - 5178.84] P:1715.14 E:0.100269 |  Ericsson across, oh, head up from Andersson, and it's not a win!
[5178.84 - 5183.84] P:1873.07 E:0.110881 |  They've got the equaliser, and it's Andreas Christensen at the back post who arrived,
[5183.84 - 5189.84] P:1827.06 E:0.103871 |  one central defender, not in it on, and Andreas Christensen arrived there at the back post
[5189.84 - 5193.84] P:1856.23 E:0.095898 |  to head it past Loris, and Denmark have made it 1-1.
[5193.84 - 5197.84] P:1857.20 E:0.092696 |  It was a really clever work set piece, because the two that they had three or four minutes ago,
[5197.84 - 5202.84] P:1801.94 E:0.100890 |  they both went to the far post, and Franz dealt with them really comfortably.
[5202.84 - 5205.84] P:1891.70 E:0.099267 |  At this time, it's whipped into the near post, it gets the flick on,
[5205.84 - 5209.84] P:1989.78 E:0.097848 |  and all it needs is someone to get on the end of it, and Christensen does that,
[5209.84 - 5213.84] P:1904.99 E:0.092317 |  and puts it in the back of the net. What a response from Denmark.
[5213.84 - 5222.84] P:1902.93 E:0.080959 |  Yeah, great delivery from Ericsson, and the header on from Jochim Andersson,
[5222.84 - 5225.84] P:1688.96 E:0.106024 |  and just stooping, Ravio with a very high foot pair actually,
[5225.84 - 5230.84] P:1857.90 E:0.091679 |  but he went in with his head, just like central defenders don't mind doing,
[5230.84 - 5235.84] P:1929.56 E:0.090289 |  in amongst the boot, and headed it in from six yards, and it flashed past Loris.
[5235.84 - 5243.84] P:1822.38 E:0.093463 |  So, Franz won, Denmark won, and the French lead lasted for approximately, far, no,
[5243.84 - 5246.84] P:1470.83 E:0.093746 |  hang on, where are we, seven minutes.
[5246.84 - 5251.84] P:1788.22 E:0.105133 |  Well, we said Ravio let Lindstrom run off him three or four minutes earlier to get that corner,
[5251.84 - 5255.84] P:1783.62 E:0.103250 |  and it's his man again that scores. Christensen runs off him as well,
[5255.84 - 5260.84] P:1882.63 E:0.084496 |  and gets to the ball before him. Good response though, isn't it, from Denmark?
[5260.84 - 5265.84] P:1629.33 E:0.079748 |  Wasn't it just? So, one-one, Franz won, Denmark won, quarter of the match to go,
[5265.84 - 5270.84] P:1641.19 E:0.085329 |  after that will be across two. So, Lucille actually tonight,
[5270.84 - 5275.84] P:1647.96 E:0.087439 |  not had the pleasure of going there yet at the World Cup.
[5275.84 - 5280.84] P:1630.77 E:0.093123 |  So, Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton with the commentary, Tim Vickery and Guillain Balagay
[5280.84 - 5283.84] P:1722.46 E:0.100952 |  will be part of the program tonight as well, but Franz coming forward,
[5283.84 - 5287.84] P:1658.76 E:0.096689 |  Dempalli into the box, running freely, and then running into white and red,
[5287.84 - 5292.84] P:1684.66 E:0.075179 |  and Denmark are able to clear it up towards the halfway line to Brathway,
[5292.84 - 5296.84] P:1729.67 E:0.075037 |  who's headed it out for a throw-in on the far side under pressure.
[5296.84 - 5303.84] P:1762.31 E:0.065105 |  So, two goals now, and Bapé for France, Christensen for Denmark.
[5303.84 - 5309.84] P:1716.27 E:0.085420 |  It's almost fitting, isn't it, that Bapé scores for Franz with all everything he's got,
[5309.84 - 5313.84] P:1861.02 E:0.079624 |  all of the skill and the talent, and then the rugged Christensen
[5313.84 - 5316.84] P:1678.79 E:0.098906 |  heads it in from a set piece at the other end.
[5316.84 - 5318.84] P:1799.26 E:0.082453 |  A well-worked set piece at the half.
[5318.84 - 5319.84] P:1619.11 E:0.071107 |  Well-worked set piece.
[5319.84 - 5322.84] P:1805.20 E:0.092084 |  It was really noticeable, actually, the two that they had beforehand went to the far post,
[5322.84 - 5326.84] P:1707.99 E:0.094413 |  didn't get anything with them, this time near post and the flick on goal.
[5326.84 - 5331.84] P:1602.72 E:0.095409 |  Both from the centre-circuit from Turemene, Dempalli has not given this up and rightly so,
[5331.84 - 5335.84] P:1811.03 E:0.082697 |  and he gets there with Anderson, puts it out of play,
[5335.84 - 5342.84] P:1674.53 E:0.070657 |  Anderson gets a little low five from Christensen for the way that he chased that, basically.
[5342.84 - 5347.84] P:1742.81 E:0.076454 |  And now the ball bounces back into the area for Schmeichel to come and pick up.
[5347.84 - 5350.84] P:1581.04 E:0.096225 |  As I say, Casper Schmeichel down there, Peter Schmeichel is here tonight,
[5350.84 - 5353.84] P:1770.04 E:0.087594 |  I think working for TV, and he'll be with us on five...
[5353.84 - 5359.84] P:1635.73 E:0.085850 |  Well, he was on breakfast this morning, Peter Schmeichel, just before I went on talking about England,
[5359.84 - 5364.84] P:1712.53 E:0.092936 |  and he'll be with us for Spain, Germany, which is the late match tomorrow night,
[5364.84 - 5370.84] P:1585.70 E:0.081815 |  which I have to say, I cannot wait for that, that is absolutely fascinating.
[5370.84 - 5375.84] P:1663.88 E:0.093566 |  Well, if the result goes against Germany in the earlier game, Japan win,
[5375.84 - 5377.84] P:1562.39 E:0.090408 |  then they have to go out and they have to beat Spain.
[5377.84 - 5383.84] P:1600.28 E:0.080455 |  Well, it's entirely possible, as Ali said earlier, that Argentina could go out tonight,
[5383.84 - 5387.84] P:1786.33 E:0.073842 |  that is possible, and Germany could go out tomorrow night.
[5387.84 - 5390.84] P:1798.84 E:0.073032 |  Here's Mbappe, France aren't going anywhere,
[5390.84 - 5394.84] P:1774.51 E:0.091884 |  the ball played to the left-hand side, and Mbappe goes one way, then the other,
[5394.84 - 5397.84] P:1717.50 E:0.094878 |  curls it into the danger area, but too close to Schmeichel,
[5397.84 - 5402.84] P:1796.21 E:0.079417 |  he's able to come forward and just grab the ball into his green shirt, blonde hair flowing,
[5402.84 - 5405.84] P:1696.31 E:0.066363 |  and he's got it safely near the penalty spot.
[5405.84 - 5411.84] P:1804.32 E:0.090806 |  He just works that ball onto his right foot, and Mbappe, and he's hoping that two-round just gets across,
[5411.84 - 5415.84] P:1901.44 E:0.090912 |  because he's ready to whip it in, he's just wanting him to run across the front of Schmeichel,
[5415.84 - 5418.84] P:1709.88 E:0.078455 |  but he didn't, he goes straight into Schmeichel's hands.
[5418.84 - 5424.84] P:1717.64 E:0.080634 |  Just be about to get underway, I think, at Twickenham, where it's England against South Africa,
[5424.84 - 5429.84] P:1686.20 E:0.081454 |  so we will let you know what happens there during the course of the next couple of hours.
[5429.84 - 5435.84] P:1712.95 E:0.079702 |  I see Denmark are going to make another change, Caspar Dahlberg, who started the first match
[5435.84 - 5438.84] P:1700.47 E:0.079781 |  against Tunisia, is going to come on as a substitute next,
[5438.84 - 5444.84] P:1681.20 E:0.078119 |  but he has Mala on the left-hand side, Mala rolls it back centrally to Ericsson,
[5444.84 - 5450.84] P:1629.07 E:0.078337 |  Christian Ericsson then squared a hoibier, and now all the way back to the halfway line again to Andersson.
[5450.84 - 5457.84] P:1657.74 E:0.081612 |  Christensen on the left-hand side, Rasmus Christensen that is, and Denmark are keeping possession,
[5457.84 - 5460.84] P:1599.22 E:0.097713 |  so it is France who've had the step off back into their own half,
[5460.84 - 5465.84] P:1756.57 E:0.067210 |  and Denmark played out to the left-hand side to Victor Nelson.
[5465.84 - 5473.84] P:1627.98 E:0.071915 |  Didier Deschamps comes and steps forward, must have thought, yes, on the way now after that exciting Mbappe goal,
[5473.84 - 5478.84] P:1696.89 E:0.082194 |  but it is Denmark who have very quickly found their way back into the match,
[5478.84 - 5483.84] P:1656.84 E:0.093050 |  and Ericsson gives it to Mala, and now a run down into the full-back position by Damsgard,
[5483.84 - 5490.84] P:1826.34 E:0.093903 |  and then across for the shot that is saved by Loris, diving down to his left, big chance,
[5490.84 - 5495.84] P:1792.21 E:0.098551 |  right in the middle of the penalty area for Jesper Lindstrom, who shot too close to Loris,
[5495.84 - 5498.84] P:1756.44 E:0.098557 |  who was able to make the save just down to his left.
[5498.84 - 5502.84] P:1851.83 E:0.089483 |  Well, as soon as they've scored the goal, France have just sat back, they thought the game was over,
[5502.84 - 5508.84] P:1792.04 E:0.096763 |  that's what their attitude would suggest, and they've been put under some real pressure from Denmark,
[5508.84 - 5511.84] P:1770.47 E:0.099509 |  and that was a really good chance for Lindstrom, should be in the back of the net.
[5511.84 - 5515.84] P:1751.28 E:0.079854 |  It should. Great response from Denmark to going a goal down.
[5515.84 - 5521.84] P:1667.59 E:0.085050 |  Denmark who have already remembered beating France twice this year in the Nations League,
[5521.84 - 5523.84] P:1622.04 E:0.083455 |  and France are finding it tough against them again.
[5523.84 - 5527.84] P:1654.24 E:0.087997 |  Another corner, they scored from the last corner from this side, remember.
[5527.84 - 5530.84] P:1735.78 E:0.088728 |  Ericsson, this to the back post, but onto a French head,
[5530.84 - 5533.84] P:1659.34 E:0.072504 |  who's able to get it away, it was Veran underneath it.
[5533.84 - 5537.84] P:1643.79 E:0.083998 |  Back to Ericsson again, Ericsson plays a low ball in from the right, he's fortunate there,
[5537.84 - 5541.84] P:1737.63 E:0.092994 |  it's bounced back to him, off to Ram, and Ericsson goes centrally, and he shoots,
[5541.84 - 5546.84] P:1672.77 E:0.078479 |  and it's hits, Turemene on the edge of the penalty area, and Denmark have got it back in the centre circle.
[5546.84 - 5548.84] P:1546.98 E:0.080287 |  Excellent play from Denmark.
[5548.84 - 5552.84] P:1739.70 E:0.082443 |  Yeah, very good play. They've just sat back, France, they thought the game was won,
[5552.84 - 5557.84] P:1751.39 E:0.090614 |  and Denmark's thinking, no, we're not having any of that, and to their credit, they've stepped it up a gear,
[5557.84 - 5561.84] P:1751.24 E:0.096555 |  and they're creating chances and looking good, and looking a different team all of a sudden.
[5561.84 - 5565.84] P:1642.86 E:0.067363 |  Double change for France coming.
[5567.84 - 5574.84] P:1856.73 E:0.080042 |  They made the change, Damsegaard is off, and Dolberg came on for him,
[5574.84 - 5579.84] P:1745.63 E:0.081954 |  so that is the number 12, Casper Dolberg, who's on loan at Sevilla,
[5579.84 - 5585.84] P:1822.59 E:0.079200 |  and France, this double change, France are going to bring on Kingsley Coleman,
[5585.84 - 5591.84] P:1789.40 E:0.095917 |  and also Canate of Liverpool, Ibrahimak Canate, so it is Raphael Veran,
[5591.84 - 5598.84] P:1741.44 E:0.069640 |  after his return to fitness, so Veran is on at the back,
[5598.84 - 5607.84] P:1539.57 E:0.076841 |  Canate is on at the back, for France, and Kingsley Coleman comes on for...
[5607.84 - 5609.84] P:1687.68 E:0.081077 |  D'Ambelli.
[5609.84 - 5611.84] P:1520.96 E:0.068460 |  D'Ambelli, thanks, Alan.
[5611.84 - 5616.84] P:1723.10 E:0.077532 |  So, Coleman, number 20 on the right-hand side,
[5616.84 - 5622.84] P:1753.95 E:0.076196 |  France playing the ball out from the back, and the score is France won, Denmark won.
[5622.84 - 5626.84] P:1782.39 E:0.076098 |  So, Didier Deschamps feeling clearly the way that the player's gone,
[5626.84 - 5632.84] P:1761.23 E:0.080413 |  since France scored the opening goal, and we're then pegged back that it needs that refreshing,
[5632.84 - 5639.84] P:1685.48 E:0.072407 |  in these sweltering conditions inside Stadium 974.
[5639.84 - 5645.84] P:1695.18 E:0.057032 |  And the ball is with France halfway inside their own penalty area,
[5645.84 - 5649.84] P:1681.84 E:0.072662 |  and Turemene turns and plays it through to Rabiot,
[5649.84 - 5653.84] P:1640.98 E:0.089265 |  and now back with Turemene again, who goes for a driving pass across field,
[5653.84 - 5657.84] P:1765.39 E:0.087208 |  Christensen heads it back into the central area,
[5657.84 - 5663.84] P:1673.53 E:0.091291 |  yet Tendons, by the way, 42,860 is the official attendance here tonight.
[5663.84 - 5667.84] P:1646.62 E:0.096004 |  Griezmann, Griezmann little ball towards the edge of the penalty area,
[5667.84 - 5670.84] P:1817.99 E:0.082021 |  France with the pass to the left-hand side to Mbappe,
[5670.84 - 5674.84] P:1605.08 E:0.088885 |  and Mbappe now well played, Christensen is able to put the tackle in,
[5674.84 - 5677.84] P:1654.98 E:0.089758 |  and it's behind, and it is a corner to France from the left.
[5677.84 - 5679.84] P:1749.89 E:0.088945 |  Good play, good defending that.
[5679.84 - 5685.84] P:1760.56 E:0.096319 |  It makes sense bringing Canate on for Vuran with his lack of game time in recent weeks.
[5685.84 - 5689.84] P:1723.08 E:0.092497 |  So, it is a corner from the left-hand side, Griezmann to take it.
[5689.84 - 5692.84] P:1618.23 E:0.098946 |  This match, 15 minutes to go, it is...
[5692.84 - 5695.84] P:1755.12 E:0.079931 |  This is fascinatingly poised.
[5695.84 - 5701.84] P:1688.34 E:0.082234 |  You can't go anywhere, or if you are going somewhere, take BBC sounds with you.
[5701.84 - 5704.84] P:1700.27 E:0.083282 |  Griezmann with the corner for France,
[5704.84 - 5708.84] P:1360.46 E:0.096658 |  and out-swinger, well done, Andersen, Joachim Andersen got up above everyone else
[5708.84 - 5711.84] P:1718.05 E:0.081223 |  and headed it away to Coleman for France.
[5711.84 - 5714.84] P:1563.41 E:0.082877 |  Now the ball on the right-hand side, and Mbappe is out there.
[5714.84 - 5717.84] P:1840.52 E:0.072867 |  Oh, a lovely change of feet, but it was almost crickle,
[5717.84 - 5720.84] P:1764.50 E:0.084469 |  and I could keep up with there as he went from one foot to the other
[5720.84 - 5723.84] P:1563.44 E:0.077419 |  and played it into the penalty area, but Denmark kept up with it,
[5723.84 - 5726.84] P:1778.04 E:0.070875 |  and headed away to comparative safety.
[5726.84 - 5729.84] P:1572.81 E:0.050742 |  France won, Denmark won,
[5729.84 - 5734.84] P:1748.93 E:0.067490 |  and Griezmann has popped up on the left-hand side here, plays it in field.
[5734.84 - 5737.84] P:1815.18 E:0.089886 |  Tumani, Griezmann, then back into the centre-circle.
[5737.84 - 5740.84] P:1971.58 E:0.086928 |  Canate, having started the opening match,
[5740.84 - 5743.84] P:1675.79 E:0.105695 |  Ibrahimo Canate, but he's seen relatively little football this season.
[5743.84 - 5746.84] P:1730.30 E:0.094728 |  Remember with the injuries that he's had for Liverpool,
[5746.84 - 5748.84] P:1738.79 E:0.095394 |  and now it's back to Rabiol,
[5748.84 - 5751.84] P:1667.42 E:0.084449 |  and Denmark have dropped right off into their defensive third.
[5751.84 - 5754.84] P:1796.44 E:0.066426 |  Still France in possession, Coleman on the right-hand side,
[5754.84 - 5758.84] P:1626.77 E:0.084707 |  and the orange boots, in comes the challenge from Nelson on him.
[5758.84 - 5761.84] P:1392.13 E:0.093533 |  The ball rolls over the white line and behind, and it's a throw-in to France.
[5761.84 - 5767.84] P:1691.59 E:0.060464 |  They're looking to get this game won, but they take the throw-in quickly,
[5767.84 - 5770.84] P:1486.40 E:0.107406 |  and now Rabiol on the overlap into the penalty area, played it across,
[5770.84 - 5773.84] P:1633.81 E:0.090666 |  but the defender was there, Christian St, Andreas Christian St
[5773.84 - 5777.84] P:1656.53 E:0.090847 |  to just coolly put it behind for another French corner from the right this time.
[5777.84 - 5779.84] P:1743.52 E:0.105266 |  Really well worked down that right-hand side.
[5779.84 - 5783.84] P:1804.93 E:0.095117 |  Rabiol give and go, and he gets the ball back, and times his run to perfection.
[5783.84 - 5787.84] P:1781.51 E:0.098911 |  Then you're just looking for that last bit of quality, the toughest bit,
[5787.84 - 5790.84] P:1820.61 E:0.104246 |  to put that ball and make sure someone gets it on the end of it,
[5790.84 - 5792.84] P:1881.63 E:0.090763 |  but Christian St, good defender, and he blocks it.
[5792.84 - 5793.84] P:1635.95 E:0.082288 |  France corner.
[5793.84 - 5798.84] P:1662.44 E:0.088117 |  France won Denmark 1, BBC Radio 5 live at Qatar 2022.
[5798.84 - 5803.84] P:1720.71 E:0.083883 |  Corner in it comes, on his head and wide at the back post.
[5803.84 - 5804.84] P:1877.83 E:0.098924 |  A stretching header.
[5804.84 - 5808.84] P:1622.72 E:0.089596 |  I think a defender at the near post might have got a touch on that.
[5808.84 - 5812.84] P:1765.60 E:0.085781 |  Chumain threw himself at it, diving header at the back post,
[5812.84 - 5816.84] P:1639.64 E:0.091866 |  and headed it wide, might have clipped the outside of the post as well.
[5816.84 - 5817.84] P:1657.02 E:0.086372 |  It hit the defender, Meila.
[5817.84 - 5819.84] P:1797.30 E:0.099207 |  Just comes off Meila, doesn't it?
[5819.84 - 5822.84] P:1820.64 E:0.096629 |  He finds himself about four yards out with a free header,
[5822.84 - 5825.84] P:1881.60 E:0.102098 |  but Meila just gets his block on it, hits his shoulder.
[5825.84 - 5827.84] P:1838.13 E:0.061965 |  It's gone in the back of the net.
[5827.84 - 5828.84] P:1704.40 E:0.087829 |  Great block.
[5828.84 - 5831.84] P:1726.84 E:0.094791 |  I mean, there have been some blocks from Danish defenders in this match,
[5831.84 - 5833.84] P:1625.22 E:0.089231 |  and that was right up there with them.
[5833.84 - 5836.84] P:1652.99 E:0.092925 |  I'm not sure he knew that much about it, so it's another corner.
[5836.84 - 5838.84] P:1639.75 E:0.078496 |  Griezmann to the back post.
[5838.84 - 5840.84] P:1798.32 E:0.083465 |  That's headed away by Christensen.
[5840.84 - 5841.84] P:1712.66 E:0.103894 |  Comes out, four France again.
[5841.84 - 5844.84] P:1621.47 E:0.100707 |  Oh, another lovely piece of skill, and the cross is in,
[5844.84 - 5850.84] P:1763.86 E:0.093056 |  and it's headed wide by the right back, Kunde, and it is deflected wide.
[5850.84 - 5851.84] P:1688.46 E:0.117883 |  It's another corner.
[5851.84 - 5855.84] P:1857.75 E:0.098915 |  This is a third consecutive French corner.
[5855.84 - 5857.84] P:1792.74 E:0.096485 |  Griezmann, one from the right, one from the left.
[5857.84 - 5858.84] P:1738.09 E:0.102861 |  Now another one.
[5858.84 - 5860.84] P:1657.46 E:0.098066 |  Denmark are under severe pressure.
[5860.84 - 5863.84] P:1714.01 E:0.101663 |  His delivery is superb from the left side and the right side.
[5863.84 - 5869.84] P:1747.85 E:0.098497 |  The way he whips the ball and makes it very, very difficult for the defenders to head away.
[5869.84 - 5871.84] P:1670.69 E:0.087150 |  So Griezmann goes across there.
[5871.84 - 5874.84] P:1626.61 E:0.098788 |  This is at the end where all of the French trickleers are,
[5874.84 - 5878.84] P:1702.67 E:0.089424 |  and they are being twirled in big numbers, and Griezmann in it comes.
[5878.84 - 5882.84] P:1722.90 E:0.093462 |  Schmeichel comes and gets a punch on it, just sort of rather daintily punched it up
[5882.84 - 5883.84] P:1167.24 E:0.105762 |  and away out of the penalty area.
[5883.84 - 5888.84] P:1792.82 E:0.091629 |  Then it's played back in from the left-hand side, and from the far side.
[5888.84 - 5893.84] P:1799.35 E:0.099355 |  Rabiot went for it with a kind of scissor overhead kick,
[5893.84 - 5899.84] P:1749.90 E:0.089687 |  but he hit it wide of the far post, high and wide, and it's behind, and a goal kick to Denmark.
[5899.84 - 5901.84] P:1706.69 E:0.092525 |  Well, that's been a theme of the night for France.
[5901.84 - 5903.84] P:1818.24 E:0.105686 |  Is there any opportunity they've got the ball into the box,
[5903.84 - 5906.84] P:1906.69 E:0.087244 |  whether it's from the left or the right, they've just thought, get it in there,
[5906.84 - 5908.84] P:1924.13 E:0.108655 |  and Rabiot was at the far post there.
[5908.84 - 5910.84] P:1700.48 E:0.043156 |  A bit of an acrobatic one, wasn't it?
[5910.84 - 5914.84] P:1511.87 E:0.086075 |  Some sad news has just been announced, Alan.
[5914.84 - 5922.84] P:1684.18 E:0.087937 |  Sorry to say that the former Scotland and British Lions rugby union player, Doddie Weir, has died.
[5922.84 - 5925.84] P:1750.73 E:0.089252 |  He was 52 Doddie Weir.
[5925.84 - 5930.84] P:1564.02 E:0.097341 |  As you might know, he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2017.
[5930.84 - 5937.84] P:1534.11 E:0.089895 |  So the sad, sad news for all of his friends and family, that Doddie Weir has sadly died.
[5937.84 - 5943.84] P:1688.86 E:0.087748 |  But what an absolute inspiration he has been in the later years of his life.
[5943.84 - 5949.84] P:1766.31 E:0.081495 |  I have a feeling, Alan, that you will have known him well.
[5949.84 - 5954.84] P:1696.32 E:0.095809 |  Yeah, and you and RIP big man, and send our condolences to all his family.
[5954.84 - 5957.84] P:1648.68 E:0.082388 |  What a family, what they've done.
[5957.84 - 5958.84] P:1729.62 E:0.080513 |  Absolutely incredible.
[5958.84 - 5964.84] P:1796.93 E:0.105359 |  Has Denmark come forward, balling from the right, that is swept wide by breath weight,
[5964.84 - 5969.84] P:1683.55 E:0.084928 |  arriving on it on the edge of the six-yard box, could chance that for Denmark.
[5969.84 - 5976.84] P:1699.48 E:0.088106 |  But I think you can just imagine the tributes that there will be being paid from all over the world to Doddie Weir.
[5976.84 - 5980.84] P:1690.67 E:0.076936 |  And we will have more on that later.
[5980.84 - 5985.84] P:1623.89 E:0.092804 |  And our rugby union correspondent, Chris Jones, of course, is at Twickenham, watching England against South Africa.
[5985.84 - 5990.84] P:1646.62 E:0.087348 |  So we'll hear more from Chris, who will be rounding it all up,
[5990.84 - 5994.84] P:1762.76 E:0.071882 |  everything that everyone's saying about the great Doddie Weir.
[5994.84 - 5995.84] P:1916.30 E:0.063612 |  Sad news.
[5995.84 - 6001.84] P:1752.28 E:0.092404 |  And of course the great work that he's done and raising awareness for MND with him and his good mate Rob Burrow.
[6001.84 - 6002.84] P:1700.05 E:0.055059 |  What a sad day.
[6002.84 - 6004.84] P:1780.05 E:0.049834 |  Very, very sad.
[6004.84 - 6009.84] P:1801.00 E:0.056411 |  Ten minutes to go here, France won, Denmark won.
[6009.84 - 6013.84] P:1768.08 E:0.061025 |  It's just a game, this isn't it, Alan, that we're watching here.
[6013.84 - 6017.84] P:1764.88 E:0.084525 |  Feels like it means the world, but it is just a game.
[6017.84 - 6025.84] P:1900.91 E:0.079004 |  Tumani has taken a bang in center field, and so we'll have a stoppage now.
[6025.84 - 6033.84] P:1807.21 E:0.080598 |  commentary to come later on Argentina, Mexico, that's from seven o'clock UK time with Alastair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton.
[6033.84 - 6040.84] P:1657.33 E:0.083329 |  And then, as I say, the Dillion White, Jermaine Franklin fight live from Wembley after ten o'clock tonight.
[6040.84 - 6047.84] P:1722.00 E:0.075689 |  Tumani has stayed down, actually. He's setting up, he's okay.
[6047.84 - 6049.84] P:1978.04 E:0.099544 |  He just clashed with his teammate, didn't he, Rabi?
[6049.84 - 6054.84] P:1737.93 E:0.069753 |  Or they both sort of ran into each other and he got the worst of it.
[6054.84 - 6057.84] P:1637.60 E:0.078059 |  So as it is, France won Denmark won.
[6057.84 - 6060.84] P:1582.15 E:0.080585 |  This group would certainly not be done yet.
[6060.84 - 6068.84] P:1716.22 E:0.063479 |  France's final match on Wednesday against Tunisia, where Tunisia will have to win that.
[6068.84 - 6071.84] P:1372.49 E:0.095800 |  It's a little bit like the England-Wales game on Tuesday night.
[6071.84 - 6078.84] P:1652.32 E:0.076682 |  It's a must-win game for Wales, that one, and that will be a must-win game for Tunisia against the World Champions.
[6078.84 - 6084.84] P:1687.25 E:0.060594 |  But that group with this scoreline, that will go to the final night.
[6084.84 - 6090.84] P:1767.01 E:0.066324 |  And Tumani is okay, he's received treatment and he's trotting back onto the field.
[6090.84 - 6094.84] P:1727.50 E:0.045303 |  Six minutes or so to go.
[6094.84 - 6101.84] P:1773.48 E:0.057134 |  Denmark in possession and Hoibje plays it out towards the far side.
[6101.84 - 6104.84] P:1660.71 E:0.073146 |  Then it finds its way back centrally to Ericsson.
[6104.84 - 6110.84] P:1559.83 E:0.068331 |  And Ericsson turns, just taps it out to the left-hand side to Nelson, Victor Nelson.
[6110.84 - 6114.84] P:1695.11 E:0.080933 |  In field, Andreas Christensen, high ball now to the right-hand side.
[6114.84 - 6118.84] P:1522.46 E:0.086275 |  Rasmus Christensen, Christensen to Christensen, one with a C, one with a K.
[6118.84 - 6123.84] P:1630.77 E:0.086373 |  And then his ball down the line looking for the run of Lindstrom down into the full-back position.
[6123.84 - 6126.84] P:1816.31 E:0.070202 |  But that was dealt with very well actually, Uppermakarno.
[6126.84 - 6129.84] P:1762.45 E:0.077737 |  And the ball is behind and it is a goal kick to France.
[6129.84 - 6133.84] P:1697.20 E:0.070605 |  Lindstrom's not going to win that ball, is he? Uppermakarno.
[6133.84 - 6138.84] P:1666.13 E:0.067153 |  Yeah, that is... I mean, he's quite willowy, isn't he?
[6138.84 - 6142.84] P:1693.14 E:0.068966 |  Lindstrom, there's not much meat on him.
[6142.84 - 6147.84] P:1719.28 E:0.071888 |  The ball is played forward by France, but chested down by Nelson.
[6147.84 - 6152.84] P:1643.20 E:0.068515 |  And Denmark will start again from inside their own half.
[6152.84 - 6160.84] P:1840.91 E:0.076879 |  Joachim Andersen just looks up, fair-haired bobbin, uses Hoibje.
[6160.84 - 6163.84] P:1689.50 E:0.093847 |  Hoibje just turns and angles it back.
[6163.84 - 6168.84] P:1770.70 E:0.089349 |  Pierre-Emile Hoibje with his French connections in his family.
[6168.84 - 6170.84] P:1689.47 E:0.077686 |  Big night for him this.
[6170.84 - 6173.84] P:1518.32 E:0.096249 |  Now the ball on the right-hand side, Christensen's running at Rabiol,
[6173.84 - 6178.84] P:1708.38 E:0.086096 |  one way and the other. Christensen's ball in, actually hits the defender on the edge of the penalty area
[6178.84 - 6182.84] P:1683.70 E:0.081209 |  and then bounces out and a shot from distance from Hoibje,
[6182.84 - 6187.84] P:1658.27 E:0.086382 |  but he pulled that wide from all the 25 yards out and it is a goal kick.
[6187.84 - 6192.84] P:1799.31 E:0.073481 |  And Denmark are going to make another change and it is the Danish...
[6192.84 - 6195.84] P:1593.55 E:0.071766 |  Obviously he's a Danish midfielder, the Brenford midfielder.
[6195.84 - 6202.84] P:1814.88 E:0.072002 |  Christian Norgard coming onto the field and he's going to replace Lindstrom,
[6202.84 - 6205.84] P:1657.24 E:0.073255 |  who was just involved in that latest attack.
[6205.84 - 6209.84] P:1720.22 E:0.086379 |  So Lindstrom off and Norgard coming on.
[6209.84 - 6214.84] P:1725.83 E:0.085030 |  I think that's a clear indication from Casper Hulmand about where we are in the game.
[6214.84 - 6220.84] P:1698.24 E:0.078273 |  Forward player coming off and Christian Norgard coming on in there, in between Hoibje.
[6220.84 - 6223.84] P:1676.54 E:0.087600 |  In fact, Ericsson just maybe just being shifted a little further forward.
[6223.84 - 6226.84] P:1878.66 E:0.092210 |  Well, if it was to say this here, this would be a really good result for Denmark,
[6226.84 - 6230.84] P:1837.60 E:0.080858 |  because they would fancy their chances going into that last game, wouldn't they?
[6230.84 - 6241.84] P:1735.85 E:0.057259 |  They would. So Christian Norgard is on and we have five minutes to play, plus added time.
[6241.84 - 6246.84] P:1703.50 E:0.066147 |  France with it on the right-hand side. The ball is played over the top
[6246.84 - 6249.84] P:1771.88 E:0.071259 |  and Coleman back onto his left foot.
[6249.84 - 6251.84] P:1773.56 E:0.105290 |  In fact, he leaves it for Griezmann. This could be dangerous.
[6251.84 - 6255.84] P:1857.79 E:0.112762 |  Griezmann's ball in and Bappe is there at the back post.
[6255.84 - 6262.84] P:1797.75 E:0.110153 |  He scores again and he runs away, hands apart, and Bappe jumps over the advertising boards
[6262.84 - 6268.84] P:1801.46 E:0.105985 |  in amongst all of the photographers and runs to all of the French trickle-ers behind the goal there.
[6268.84 - 6273.84] P:1774.87 E:0.103060 |  What a star he is. But there was the ball in from Griezmann, really, that made that.
[6273.84 - 6277.84] P:1738.02 E:0.097774 |  Schmeichel could do nothing about it and France are back in front, two-one.
[6277.84 - 6282.84] P:1826.23 E:0.105523 |  And it was the run of Coleman, the way he just goes short and then spins and then it gets the ball
[6282.84 - 6286.84] P:1722.82 E:0.107759 |  and he's running into the space. Griezmann backs him up and says,
[6286.84 - 6289.84] P:1806.83 E:0.104410 |  no, leave the ball, I'll put the ball in, I'll cross it.
[6289.84 - 6295.84] P:1899.83 E:0.096511 |  And he had the quality and there's that man again in Bappe at the far post just to tuck it away.
[6295.84 - 6298.84] P:1797.89 E:0.089539 |  What a goal. What a brilliant run and cross.
[6298.84 - 6305.84] P:1754.93 E:0.094197 |  That's ominous for all Golden Boot chasers and Bappe scores his second goal of the game,
[6305.84 - 6310.84] P:1756.63 E:0.091936 |  his third goal of this World Cup and this is only the second match.
[6310.84 - 6314.84] P:1849.24 E:0.086013 |  Chimney's run perfectly almost.
[6314.84 - 6318.84] P:1872.77 E:0.097175 |  Yeah, it is going to be a really tight one, but what about the cross?
[6318.84 - 6322.84] P:1881.21 E:0.097793 |  And the run from Coleman makes it all as well before, you know that.
[6322.84 - 6326.84] P:1946.98 E:0.087785 |  Just a few seconds before and he just managed to get across the defender
[6326.84 - 6331.84] P:1858.10 E:0.095009 |  and sort of nudge it in with his right thigh there and Bappe at that far post.
[6331.84 - 6335.84] P:1969.49 E:0.100689 |  But the run from Coleman, he goes short and then the defender's stupid enough to go with him,
[6335.84 - 6339.84] P:1922.22 E:0.089045 |  which then creates the space in behind and that's where the cross comes from
[6339.84 - 6342.84] P:1846.78 E:0.079155 |  because Griezmann backs him up and as I said about the quality,
[6342.84 - 6346.84] P:1935.19 E:0.097435 |  whether it's from the left hand side or the right hand side and no surprise,
[6346.84 - 6352.84] P:1945.18 E:0.088360 |  it's another cross from France. They've put so many in there tonight and it's been successful for them.
[6352.84 - 6357.84] P:1680.22 E:0.090892 |  Yeah, as Julian LaRonge was telling us before the game and as you might have seen for yourself
[6357.84 - 6362.84] P:1669.53 E:0.101439 |  from the first match, the Australia game, this role that Griezmann's been giving,
[6362.84 - 6367.84] P:1733.99 E:0.109734 |  kind of roving number 10 role, you know that he can cause some damage in that position.
[6367.84 - 6370.84] P:1762.72 E:0.093360 |  He has done in this game and that was the delivery.
[6370.84 - 6374.84] P:1755.45 E:0.091302 |  I mean, it was almost unstoppable when Bappe was there.
[6374.84 - 6376.84] P:1662.90 E:0.099735 |  I mean, he was at what, a yard out, something like that?
[6376.84 - 6379.84] P:1663.21 E:0.086345 |  And as Alan says, sort of just jumped at the ball,
[6379.84 - 6383.84] P:1666.13 E:0.091478 |  it hit him on the upper right thigh and Schmeichel on the goal line,
[6383.84 - 6385.84] P:1554.71 E:0.082542 |  couldn't do anything about it, it was in the net.
[6385.84 - 6388.84] P:1839.04 E:0.089251 |  It's just a superstar, isn't it? You can score all sorts of goals.
[6388.84 - 6389.84] P:1748.11 E:0.067243 |  You can.
[6389.84 - 6391.84] P:1822.51 E:0.105252 |  I mean, that's a scruffy goal there from a yard or two out.
[6391.84 - 6392.84] P:1801.25 E:0.058739 |  That's fine.
[6392.84 - 6396.84] P:1862.71 E:0.096987 |  You don't get two for scoring one from about 30 yards and beating three players.
[6396.84 - 6400.84] P:1765.18 E:0.103899 |  That to me would mean more than having the volley from the edge of the box or whatever it may be.
[6400.84 - 6404.84] P:1962.74 E:0.095204 |  It's a scrappy goal, but at least he's in and around the 60 yard box to get those goals.
[6404.84 - 6406.84] P:1683.86 E:0.086857 |  Well, time's running out.
[6406.84 - 6408.84] P:1725.28 E:0.084105 |  We're in the 88th minute.
[6408.84 - 6412.84] P:1711.34 E:0.083978 |  Dan Markovic have already come from a goal down to make it 1-1.
[6412.84 - 6414.84] P:1837.71 E:0.069187 |  Now they're 2-1 down.
[6414.84 - 6418.84] P:1797.46 E:0.096765 |  I'm not sure they've got it in them to come up with another one, but let's see.
[6418.84 - 6421.84] P:1839.84 E:0.095351 |  You know, you cannot underestimate this Danish team.
[6421.84 - 6428.84] P:1871.99 E:0.075142 |  They've got bags of spirit, but they've not got bags of time in this match.
[6428.84 - 6430.84] P:1751.61 E:0.077314 |  Anderson, little ball forward.
[6430.84 - 6433.84] P:1831.39 E:0.082454 |  Norgaard, one of the recently arrived substitutes.
[6433.84 - 6437.84] P:1655.87 E:0.082599 |  In fact, I'm not sure he touched the ball by the time Franced scored their second goal.
[6437.84 - 6440.84] P:1676.65 E:0.075952 |  Back to Christensen on the right-hand side.
[6440.84 - 6442.84] P:1726.49 E:0.095490 |  Now Anderson, he's going to try a shot.
[6442.84 - 6444.84] P:1613.10 E:0.101620 |  It's deflected to the edge of the penalty area where Coleman takes it down,
[6444.84 - 6447.84] P:1754.42 E:0.109137 |  and now Kingsley Coleman is carrying it forward, and Babby wants it,
[6447.84 - 6448.84] P:1649.70 E:0.099150 |  and Babby wants it.
[6448.84 - 6451.84] P:1558.06 E:0.098529 |  He's on the hat-trick, but Coleman didn't pass the ball.
[6451.84 - 6455.84] P:1725.62 E:0.088652 |  He was on the top of the open down in anticipation.
[6455.84 - 6457.84] P:1676.88 E:0.083783 |  Come on, give me the ball, pass it.
[6457.84 - 6459.84] P:1722.86 E:0.091700 |  Here he is now, he has got it.
[6459.84 - 6462.84] P:1656.99 E:0.095228 |  He runs away from Christensen, who tried to take him over at thigh height,
[6462.84 - 6465.84] P:1657.19 E:0.087139 |  but he wasn't going down there on Babby.
[6465.84 - 6467.84] P:1706.25 E:0.091786 |  Then there was a couple of stepovers for good measure,
[6467.84 - 6471.84] P:1520.84 E:0.089288 |  but Norgaard had arrived on the scene, so he goes back into his own half.
[6471.84 - 6473.84] P:1815.61 E:0.084909 |  I don't see a weakness in his game.
[6473.84 - 6475.84] P:1828.56 E:0.095127 |  He described him as a superstar.
[6475.84 - 6477.84] P:1675.33 E:0.092327 |  He's got incredible talent.
[6477.84 - 6480.84] P:1849.16 E:0.099915 |  Whatever you want, the touch or the technique, the left foot or the right foot,
[6480.84 - 6483.84] P:1831.05 E:0.096035 |  the spring in the air, the ability to finish it off,
[6483.84 - 6487.84] P:1800.98 E:0.099897 |  the ability to get in and score the great goals as well as the scrappy goals.
[6487.84 - 6490.84] P:1813.20 E:0.088245 |  I don't see a weakness. He's fantastic. Great to watch.
[6490.84 - 6497.84] P:1754.29 E:0.074521 |  It's Alayla Blurr time inside the stadium here, next to the dock.
[6497.84 - 6502.84] P:1735.11 E:0.085047 |  Stadium 974, the attractively named stadium next to the gulf.
[6502.84 - 6506.84] P:1678.58 E:0.082559 |  As they're singing, Alayla Blurr, Didier Deschamps,
[6506.84 - 6508.84] P:1770.55 E:0.083033 |  who's going to make another substitution,
[6508.84 - 6513.84] P:1785.78 E:0.085084 |  Yusuf Fafana is going to come into the midfield, the Monaco man, Didier Deschamps,
[6513.84 - 6516.84] P:1620.07 E:0.095128 |  look towards those supporters singing, Alayla Blurr,
[6516.84 - 6519.84] P:1602.17 E:0.088122 |  and he clapped his hands a little bit like Mick Jagger does when he's on stage.
[6519.84 - 6522.84] P:1579.51 E:0.071484 |  That little sort of clap like that.
[6522.84 - 6525.84] P:1620.93 E:0.083315 |  And France have got the ball in his own half.
[6525.84 - 6529.84] P:1793.29 E:0.087632 |  I do get the impression, you know, that Babby is happier in this team or this squad
[6529.84 - 6533.84] P:1736.01 E:0.086873 |  without Benzema, as stupid as that sounds with the talent that he has
[6533.84 - 6535.84] P:1815.19 E:0.096967 |  and his ability, etc.
[6535.84 - 6539.84] P:1739.42 E:0.090064 |  But I just think that Babby is that little bit happier, and maybe the squad is.
[6539.84 - 6547.84] P:1717.92 E:0.068873 |  Yeah, and when you've got a happy and Babby, that spells danger for everyone else.
[6547.84 - 6550.84] P:1773.94 E:0.087595 |  Two goals in the match, Denmark coming forward,
[6550.84 - 6555.84] P:1700.80 E:0.086566 |  cross from the left-hand side, and it will be seven minutes of added time
[6555.84 - 6558.84] P:1739.86 E:0.093893 |  for the team that will play in this game.
[6558.84 - 6560.84] P:1753.27 E:0.109157 |  And here's a long ball pumped forward for France.
[6560.84 - 6564.84] P:1697.93 E:0.109628 |  Oh, and Babby is under this. He goes for goal as it drops over his shoulder
[6564.84 - 6567.84] P:1725.55 E:0.086224 |  and bounces up, but shoots straight at Schmeichel from the edge of the area.
[6567.84 - 6570.84] P:1719.19 E:0.081195 |  And look at the reaction of his partner up front.
[6570.84 - 6574.84] P:1802.02 E:0.095887 |  He's screaming at him, thinking, you can pass that to me.
[6574.84 - 6577.84] P:1865.71 E:0.094201 |  He's in the middle of the goal, but no, he's on the hat-trick,
[6577.84 - 6581.84] P:1748.07 E:0.079713 |  he's sitting up nicely for the volley, he just didn't catch it right.
[6581.84 - 6584.84] P:1572.72 E:0.080864 |  He's greedy centre forwards, Alan.
[6584.84 - 6587.84] P:1606.39 E:0.097930 |  He's on the great, eh? Should be more of them.
[6587.84 - 6589.84] P:1669.18 E:0.085075 |  But he had... He was like a sort of...
[6589.84 - 6591.84] P:1542.76 E:0.092841 |  I'm not passing that either, by the way.
[6591.84 - 6595.84] P:1440.47 E:0.090675 |  But the way he was going for goal there, it was a little bit like Gaza,
[6595.84 - 6599.84] P:1714.36 E:0.088993 |  you were in 96, wasn't it, but just further out on the edge of the area.
[6599.84 - 6602.84] P:1641.22 E:0.082462 |  But it was the way that the ball dropped over his shoulder, just as it bounced up.
[6602.84 - 6605.84] P:1862.52 E:0.107672 |  Is there any reaction though, John, is that when your teammates are looking at you
[6605.84 - 6608.84] P:1887.74 E:0.104413 |  and you stick your hand up to say, yeah, I know, I'm sorry,
[6608.84 - 6610.84] P:1540.24 E:0.068372 |  you've got every right to go for his hat-trick.
[6610.84 - 6612.84] P:1534.86 E:0.085165 |  Yeah, of course. France two, Denmark one.
[6612.84 - 6616.84] P:1833.79 E:0.090063 |  Denmark coming forward, laid off by Brathway, a little flick on the edge of the box,
[6616.84 - 6618.84] P:1648.48 E:0.092465 |  but there was no one there in a white shirt.
[6618.84 - 6624.84] P:1655.95 E:0.076387 |  So we're well into time at it on now, in the second minute of the 7th.
[6624.84 - 6630.84] P:1756.43 E:0.085572 |  England, South Africa is underway, and if you've just switched on to us on 5 Live,
[6630.84 - 6635.84] P:1788.25 E:0.084894 |  more very soon on the sad news that has just been announced this afternoon,
[6635.84 - 6638.84] P:1674.76 E:0.061591 |  the sad death of Doddy Weir.
[6638.84 - 6641.84] P:1833.16 E:0.064261 |  So more on that coming shortly.
[6641.84 - 6646.84] P:1840.27 E:0.073646 |  The latest Danish change, Christensen, goes off,
[6646.84 - 6653.84] P:1636.11 E:0.089708 |  and it is the No. 26, Alexander Bar, who comes on from Benfica, the right back,
[6653.84 - 6658.84] P:1788.98 E:0.086321 |  so that's a straight swap, his first taste of action at this World Cup.
[6658.84 - 6662.84] P:1863.96 E:0.085669 |  So Mark Chapman will be picking up very shortly,
[6662.84 - 6668.84] P:1855.27 E:0.086321 |  as we also build up to Argentina against Mexico, the big match tonight.
[6668.84 - 6673.84] P:1800.29 E:0.089336 |  And France making the change, it's Griezmann who's coming off, he's had a good night, Alain Shearer.
[6673.84 - 6678.84] P:1759.92 E:0.093872 |  Very, very good, great quality on the ball, when he's got the ball at his feet left foot,
[6678.84 - 6682.84] P:1642.03 E:0.088635 |  his ability to pick a pass, and the way to pass has been sensational,
[6682.84 - 6688.84] P:1793.71 E:0.093939 |  and every opportunity, him more than anyone, when he's got the chance to put the ball in the box, he has done that.
[6688.84 - 6695.84] P:1743.40 E:0.070640 |  So Yusuf Fafanar is on for what is only his fourth cap for the 23-year-old, as I say, from Monaco,
[6696.84 - 6706.84] P:1746.80 E:0.069780 |  the No. 13 that he is. So deep in added time, Denmark straining to see if they can find this second equaliser in the match.
[6706.84 - 6714.84] P:1636.58 E:0.082884 |  This is going to leave Denmark on just one point after two matches, and France will be through to the last 16,
[6714.84 - 6719.84] P:1601.54 E:0.089254 |  the defending champions. Defending champions have not fared well at recent World Cups,
[6719.84 - 6723.84] P:1832.13 E:0.079612 |  but France will be through with a match to spare, and you know what that means.
[6723.84 - 6729.84] P:1753.94 E:0.082946 |  And actually, it's a fair point for Tunisia, and sure Didier Deschamps will make a number of changes,
[6729.84 - 6732.84] P:1795.83 E:0.087160 |  certainly with a World Cup being played here in the desert.
[6732.84 - 6736.84] P:1772.99 E:0.081369 |  However, all you have to do is look at some of the talent that is on the bench,
[6736.84 - 6741.84] P:1677.98 E:0.096709 |  who would be coming into the team, and also playing for places in the knockout stages of the World Cup.
[6741.84 - 6744.84] P:1863.00 E:0.079604 |  Maybe it won't make it any easier for Tunisia.
[6744.84 - 6748.84] P:1879.40 E:0.089121 |  We've spoken about the injuries in the French squad that we had before the tournament,
[6748.84 - 6753.84] P:1884.93 E:0.092900 |  and of course, leading up to the tournament, but when you've got Mbappe in your team,
[6753.84 - 6760.84] P:1850.70 E:0.079528 |  you have got a real live chance of being successful in this competition. He's that good.
[6760.84 - 6765.84] P:1793.46 E:0.084386 |  2-1 France lead. We'll round up the main stories in the FA Cup as well,
[6765.84 - 6768.84] P:1795.46 E:0.087134 |  for you, De Gannon and Red Bridge against Gillingham currently being played.
[6768.84 - 6772.84] P:1781.33 E:0.085831 |  But the ball on the right-hand side with Denmark, and now Ericsson inside the box.
[6772.84 - 6776.84] P:1600.15 E:0.096245 |  It's taken on by Barr on the right-hand side into the penalty area,
[6776.84 - 6780.84] P:1785.56 E:0.102429 |  but Ravio was there as that final line of defence volleys it downfield.
[6780.84 - 6784.84] P:1731.44 E:0.103830 |  It's not Mbappe who's chasing at this time, it's Turan, but Mbappe is set off,
[6784.84 - 6787.84] P:1757.27 E:0.099475 |  and he is sprinting now into the D on the edge of the penalty area,
[6787.84 - 6792.84] P:1710.87 E:0.092597 |  but Dembele doesn't try and find him. He just takes the ball towards the corner of the penalty area,
[6792.84 - 6797.84] P:1635.47 E:0.097256 |  beats two men, plays it back to Mbappe on the edge of the box, who is on his back foot, actually,
[6797.84 - 6803.84] P:1791.08 E:0.076365 |  and that meant that Mela could put in the challenge. Still France with it.
[6803.84 - 6806.84] P:1571.02 E:0.079972 |  Coleman on the right-hand side comes back.
[6806.84 - 6810.84] P:1708.15 E:0.093963 |  Turan didn't know whether to run into the corner and keep the ball or actually attack the goal.
[6810.84 - 6815.84] P:1834.71 E:0.087633 |  I think Deschamps wanted him to protect the ball and go into the corner with only a couple of minutes left.
[6815.84 - 6819.84] P:1679.83 E:0.085281 |  But the speed of that run from Mbappe through the middle, off the ball.
[6819.84 - 6824.84] P:1796.74 E:0.087092 |  I mean, he was greased lightning.
[6824.84 - 6828.84] P:1933.04 E:0.096665 |  France with Turemene, just keeping possession.
[6828.84 - 6832.84] P:1763.39 E:0.103155 |  The Coleman now turns, and he sets off towards the penalty area.
[6832.84 - 6836.84] P:1829.44 E:0.091880 |  Step over there, pulls it across, stretching away from Nelson,
[6836.84 - 6840.84] P:1794.26 E:0.066451 |  and he was fortunate there in that he was off-balance,
[6840.84 - 6844.84] P:1660.46 E:0.098770 |  but he was able to find a teammate, and Denmark cleared the halfway line.
[6844.84 - 6849.84] P:1945.02 E:0.096289 |  Deschamps' substitution has worked, you know, and Coleman on that right-hand side.
[6849.84 - 6853.84] P:1899.56 E:0.093038 |  Dembele was looking a little bit tired, so he takes him off and puts Coleman on the other side.
[6853.84 - 6858.84] P:1870.98 E:0.085490 |  He just had that added bit of pace back into the game, and it's worked perfectly.
[6858.84 - 6869.84] P:1809.21 E:0.080120 |  And Denmark conceded a free kick just in front of Kasper Huland, who, incredibly, he's put a jacket on Kasper Huland.
[6869.84 - 6872.84] P:1711.84 E:0.090448 |  But they do say it on, they're down at pitch level.
[6872.84 - 6878.84] P:1690.79 E:0.086574 |  It can be quite chilly with all of those vents around the ground, so he's obviously feeling it down there.
[6879.84 - 6887.84] P:1811.51 E:0.061851 |  But France are nearly there into the last 16, and who would bet against them?
[6887.84 - 6894.84] P:1550.17 E:0.088434 |  Even with all of the big-name absentees going a long, long way, the defending champions at this World Cup,
[6894.84 - 6900.84] P:1669.76 E:0.076735 |  trying to become the first team since Brazil to successfully defend the World Cup.
[6900.84 - 6904.84] P:1729.44 E:0.091382 |  That was back in 1962, winners in 58 and 62.
[6904.84 - 6910.84] P:1871.09 E:0.091150 |  So 60 years since any team has lifted two consecutive World Cup trophies.
[6910.84 - 6917.84] P:1824.39 E:0.097131 |  Ball for Denmark, played foot at the edge of the box, and it has to be headed away by Theo Hernandez.
[6917.84 - 6919.84] P:1778.82 E:0.074614 |  And he does so, and it's out of play.
[6919.84 - 6924.84] P:1800.65 E:0.089465 |  We've had some very, very late goals at this World Cup, so we're not ruling anything out.
[6924.84 - 6930.84] P:1701.01 E:0.088309 |  Alexander Bar is going to take this, and he's actually walked and backed right up against the advertising hoardings.
[6930.84 - 6934.84] P:1699.50 E:0.092711 |  Lots of white shirts in the French penalty area. This might be their last chance.
[6934.84 - 6939.84] P:1633.98 E:0.093024 |  We're in the seventh minute of added time. Long, long throw from Bar. Nelson tried to flick it on.
[6939.84 - 6943.84] P:1688.65 E:0.100848 |  It comes out further shot from Mélan, the left wing back.
[6943.84 - 6950.84] P:1804.93 E:0.093443 |  He snatched at it, bounced up the waist height, and he's got right underneath it and ballooned it over the top of the crossbar.
[6950.84 - 6954.84] P:1738.70 E:0.084317 |  He's done France a right favour there, hasn't he? I can't believe he's attempted that from that far out.
[6954.84 - 6961.84] P:1778.99 E:0.091676 |  It just needed to be helped back into the box to keep the pressure on France, but he put it 20, 30 yards over the bar.
[6961.84 - 6963.84] P:1670.51 E:0.093283 |  Thanks very much, Laurie says.
[6963.84 - 6970.84] P:1690.20 E:0.094643 |  It was a real floater, I think it came down just to go with that Danish flag that says what looks the worst is Spenge.
[6970.84 - 6973.84] P:1741.89 E:0.109822 |  But I guess it's Spender in Denmark.
[6973.84 - 6977.84] P:1761.28 E:0.104003 |  And that's it. There's no time for Laurie to take the goal kick.
[6978.84 - 6985.84] P:1815.04 E:0.098239 |  That is it. The match is over. France have won it with two goals from Kylian and Bate.
[6985.84 - 6992.84] P:1718.05 E:0.094687 |  Denmark are left with one point from two matches and are struggling. They're up against it to get through.
[6992.84 - 6998.84] P:1654.10 E:0.097879 |  But France don't have such worries. Two wins out of two and the defending champions are through.
[6998.84 - 7000.84] P:1740.13 E:0.104499 |  They'll be in the last 16. Alan Shearer.
[7000.84 - 7007.84] P:1862.80 E:0.092320 |  They've looked very good again, particularly in forward areas. Griezmann, Korman, Dambelle and of course that guy and Bapé.
[7007.84 - 7010.84] P:1862.09 E:0.101394 |  What a player, what a superstar. He made the difference tonight.
[7010.84 - 7015.84] P:1967.63 E:0.092844 |  They were asked the question when Denmark got back into the game and got the equaliser. What have you got?
[7015.84 - 7020.84] P:1875.68 E:0.081398 |  They make a couple of changes, Deschamps does and they work and they work perfectly.
[7020.84 - 7027.84] P:1868.80 E:0.095187 |  When you've got that guy and that team and Bapé and the form that he's in, he looks so comfortable, so confident in front of goal
[7027.84 - 7032.84] P:1843.38 E:0.074664 |  and everything that he's doing, you've got a chance. He won the game for them.
[7032.84 - 7039.84] P:1772.61 E:0.085957 |  France six points out of six, then Australia with three, Denmark with one, Tunisia with one.
[7039.84 - 7047.84] P:1788.11 E:0.085584 |  So that's going to be quite a match. Denmark against Australia on the final night of this group on Wednesday.
[7047.84 - 7052.84] P:1795.17 E:0.091902 |  But France can celebrate. The celebrations are quite muted.
[7052.84 - 7057.84] P:1568.16 E:0.099888 |  Not in the stands, all of the trickleers are being waved there by the French fans and they are now going over to them.
[7057.84 - 7061.84] P:1792.06 E:0.088965 |  They'll be able to do whatever they like when it comes to the final match, Didier Deschamps.
[7061.84 - 7064.84] P:1559.87 E:0.104660 |  That is the luxury. That's what England wanted last night.
[7064.84 - 7069.84] P:1606.59 E:0.105957 |  Meanwhile, the Danish squad are all gathered round with Casper Hulman and you can tell,
[7069.84 - 7073.84] P:1751.83 E:0.099864 |  Thor to already being sent forward to that match against Australia.
[7073.84 - 7080.84] P:1764.53 E:0.096348 |  Final score though here in stadium 974, France two, Denmark one.
[7080.84 - 7083.84] P:1822.75 E:0.072047 |  And it's back to Mark Chapman.
