[0.00 - 4.04] P:1713.97 E:0.055742 |  Ash Barty is a game away from round two, leading five love in the
[4.04 - 8.72] P:1576.17 E:0.074133 |  decider. Yes, thank you, Gigi. Thank you, Mariam, for now. I'm due to pop
[8.72 - 12.32] P:1695.33 E:0.052625 |  back on to five. I think around 4.20 with an update from Wimbledon.
[12.32 - 16.96] P:1802.58 E:0.065912 |  But very much now, our focus is on the football. You've heard from Boris
[16.96 - 22.24] P:1825.60 E:0.053495 |  Becker today. He wants penalties. Alex Vanders-Verev wants penalties. I'm
[22.24 - 26.24] P:1734.74 E:0.067106 |  exhausted even thinking about it. Chappers is here for us now, Wembley.
[26.24 - 29.60] P:1575.75 E:0.071188 |  Chappers, we've got to know each other over the years. I wouldn't go as
[29.60 - 34.00] P:1910.51 E:0.058861 |  far as we know each other intimately. But... No, I think that's a fair
[34.00 - 39.68] P:1784.72 E:0.064071 |  assumption, Tony. You strike me rather like me as a glass half empty, man.
[39.68 - 46.52] P:1563.25 E:0.065529 |  I don't know. I don't know why. I've just formed that opinion. But I need
[46.52 - 50.24] P:1706.56 E:0.058322 |  some positivity now from you and the team. Well, John Murray's just
[50.24 - 54.80] P:1839.73 E:0.060650 |  given me a very smug, knowing grin at the suggestion I may be glass half
[54.88 - 60.32] P:1771.93 E:0.058807 |  empty, Tony. There is a lot of positivity amongst the team. Micah, in
[60.32 - 64.80] P:1564.23 E:0.065410 |  particular, is incredibly positive and is bouncing everywhere. So much so
[64.80 - 68.48] P:1763.22 E:0.057928 |  that I've had to take the winegums off him because he has any more sugar
[68.48 - 71.68] P:1720.38 E:0.068297 |  than people's speakers are going to blow this afternoon during the course of
[71.68 - 76.16] P:1595.60 E:0.061499 |  our coverage. Tony, I will be glass half full throughout the course of the
[76.16 - 80.08] P:1769.22 E:0.065077 |  afternoon. Don't you worry about that. Don't you worry about that. Back with Tony
[80.08 - 84.08] P:1797.63 E:0.061475 |  Wimbledon later. And the Wimbledon coverage will probably be on sports
[84.16 - 88.32] P:1928.42 E:0.056604 |  extra sooner than they thought it might be because England's cricketers are
[88.32 - 91.84] P:1873.48 E:0.070015 |  doing their very best to get the one day internationalist Sri Lanka over and
[91.84 - 95.60] P:1841.20 E:0.064889 |  done with so they can follow the football as well. England currently 64 for
[95.60 - 102.88] P:1929.47 E:0.062041 |  two. Sri Lanka earlier 185 all out in that first ODI at the Riverside in
[102.88 - 108.40] P:1757.51 E:0.066442 |  Durham. So here we are then. We are at Wembley. It's a grey, wet Wembley at
[108.48 - 115.20] P:1883.07 E:0.054104 |  the moment for England against Germany, a place in the last eight up for grabs.
[115.20 - 119.60] P:1865.24 E:0.063205 |  We have one heck of a team with us here. John Murray, Chris Waddle, Karen
[119.60 - 124.80] P:1934.21 E:0.063126 |  Carney and Micah Richards. Once this game is done, we've got Sweden, Ukraine.
[124.80 - 129.28] P:1876.04 E:0.068482 |  That's the final last 16 match of this tournament. And of course, the winners
[129.28 - 134.72] P:1898.80 E:0.060881 |  of this game will play the winners of Sweden and Ukraine. And we'll keep you
[134.72 - 139.12] P:1913.83 E:0.066922 |  up to date with Wimbledon and the cricket as well as Harry Kane leads England
[139.12 - 144.00] P:1897.03 E:0.064967 |  out onto the pitch here. Wembley, John Murray, our correspondent just sitting
[144.00 - 149.52] P:1720.76 E:0.062516 |  behind me. They strike a very different vision to the one they did before
[149.52 - 153.44] P:1740.90 E:0.070373 |  that Croatian game when it was hot and sunny and they all just came out in
[153.44 - 158.88] P:1782.65 E:0.061551 |  T-shirts and shorts. It's Harry McQuay is actually shivering a little bit at the
[158.88 - 163.28] P:1857.93 E:0.066827 |  moment under his hoodie as he just does a few stretches as well. But they're
[163.28 - 168.16] P:1849.17 E:0.059664 |  wrapped up warm, John, ahead of this last 16 time. Yeah, touch and nerves maybe,
[168.16 - 172.64] P:1938.68 E:0.057807 |  perhaps, but they certainly look, don't they, as though they've got their
[172.64 - 177.04] P:1891.98 E:0.065740 |  game faces on. And I felt that last night. I spoke to Garry Southgate last night
[177.04 - 184.88] P:1893.97 E:0.063239 |  and Harry Kane over the video interview that we did. And yeah, I think focus was
[184.88 - 189.92] P:1834.94 E:0.060177 |  very much the phrase that you would use. But you know, obviously Mark, last
[190.00 - 196.24] P:1797.84 E:0.060664 |  night we referred to and mentioned Euro 96, etc, etc, etc. And I completely
[196.24 - 201.60] P:1830.32 E:0.064882 |  understand why Garry Southgate was keen to sidestep questions about all that.
[201.60 - 206.40] P:1946.18 E:0.062253 |  But we don't have to do that, do we? We can enjoy and remember what England
[206.40 - 210.24] P:1968.93 E:0.061764 |  against the Germans at the tournaments is all about. Whether you go back to
[210.24 - 215.84] P:1827.62 E:0.063850 |  Bloomfontein, whether you go back to Turin, or even Leon in 1970, or even all
[215.84 - 222.08] P:1851.68 E:0.056324 |  the way back to 1966. But I think the Southgate story is almost Hollywood,
[222.08 - 227.44] P:1885.58 E:0.057069 |  isn't it, when you think that player that missed the penalty under the Twin Towers
[227.44 - 230.88] P:1933.82 E:0.063452 |  almost 25 years ago to the man who's going to be the manager on the
[230.88 - 235.92] P:1813.68 E:0.060542 |  touchline here under the arch in 2021. I think it's so compelling, don't you?
[236.64 - 241.52] P:1804.52 E:0.067882 |  Who would play him, John, in a Hollywood movie? Who would play Garry Southgate?
[242.40 - 247.44] P:1823.88 E:0.067621 |  Well, I'm not very good at my Hollywood actors in all honesty, Mark. You've probably got it.
[248.08 - 250.24] P:1856.93 E:0.075739 |  I saw him on the names. Bradley Cooper.
[250.24 - 253.44] P:1842.48 E:0.066007 |  Yeah, I saw him on the names, but I don't necessarily know what they look like.
[253.44 - 256.40] P:1808.76 E:0.064792 |  Oh, and if you had a cameo, who would play you?
[257.68 - 258.80] P:1822.79 E:0.074977 |  Oh, Bill Nye.
[261.68 - 263.60] P:1871.83 E:0.071678 |  I was thinking John Cleese, I should have.
[264.80 - 265.84] P:1838.86 E:0.062147 |  Probably my second choice.
[267.84 - 269.60] P:1858.43 E:0.073838 |  Chris Waddley, you got your game pace on?
[270.16 - 274.72] P:1871.83 E:0.049013 |  Yeah, yeah, it's obviously it's the build up now, isn't it?
[274.72 - 279.92] P:1807.88 E:0.063050 |  So the players now just on a bit of chat, a bit of laugh, aren't they?
[279.92 - 284.00] P:1760.06 E:0.063172 |  Trying to relax and then they'll go back in and once they put that kit on, that means business, doesn't it?
[285.36 - 290.48] P:1705.33 E:0.066983 |  What's interesting about the team this afternoon is that John and Chris have done many of these
[290.48 - 297.92] P:1763.70 E:0.063350 |  tournaments. I've done a few, not as many as that experienced duo. But in Micah and Karen
[298.64 - 303.12] P:1859.08 E:0.062969 |  we have two people with us for the first time at an England tournament.
[303.12 - 309.12] P:1913.35 E:0.069068 |  And even though you have pulled on the England shirt, both of you and Karen, you go first.
[310.00 - 317.60] P:1838.63 E:0.064959 |  You are as excited as any fan in this stadium or indeed listening or watching around the country.
[318.48 - 324.00] P:1827.88 E:0.067875 |  Yeah, I rocked up Deny and my England jersey and you looked at me and thought, oh, he's a newcomer,
[324.08 - 330.56] P:1872.94 E:0.066837 |  not a clue, not a clue. I literally rocked up, I'm so excited for long got my England shirt on
[330.56 - 334.96] P:1836.19 E:0.068805 |  and used that all pristine clean the foot. I've come to the wrong party here but um.
[334.96 - 339.44] P:1830.80 E:0.065636 |  Glass half empty again, was it Karen? Pass us a wine, go with you Micah.
[341.12 - 345.52] P:1839.09 E:0.064554 |  Hey, I'm so excited, I've had far too many sweets. I look like I'm about to play a game
[345.52 - 347.84] P:1878.59 E:0.058589 |  with machine pads and socks on. I'm good to go.
[348.56 - 356.56] P:1767.78 E:0.059511 |  Hey, is it because, do you think, Micah, you can allow yourself to be excited and enjoy this?
[356.56 - 364.48] P:1967.04 E:0.053111 |  Whereas if you were down there in that group, you've got to be focused, you've got to be serious.
[365.04 - 372.80] P:1918.44 E:0.055623 |  It's a job. Exactly that, Chappellers. I think you can let the emotions get the better of you
[372.80 - 377.44] P:1639.78 E:0.060193 |  when you're up here. I mean, you know, working at a tournament just for the first time. I'm so
[377.44 - 384.40] P:1662.48 E:0.066205 |  excited. I'm like a Cheshire cat is what they call him, smiling and just being here at Wembley
[384.96 - 390.72] P:1799.20 E:0.065820 |  and my emotions get the better of me. When you're a player, you can't let that happen. You've got
[390.72 - 396.88] P:1730.71 E:0.064620 |  to focus on the job. You know, England, Germany is always a fixture, no matter when it is, it's
[396.88 - 401.92] P:1700.94 E:0.064593 |  always when you look forward to and this is the only part of the pitch now. The players are walking
[401.92 - 406.64] P:1769.05 E:0.057942 |  on the pitch where you just start to feel the nerves coming. You've done you, you've prepped
[406.64 - 412.08] P:1591.10 E:0.060932 |  the last night, you've had a good night's sleep and then it's showtime now and this is going to
[412.08 - 420.24] P:1817.40 E:0.056380 |  separate the men for the boys. What are the benefits of doing this and coming out onto the
[420.24 - 424.80] P:1723.40 E:0.061500 |  pitch as that little group to have a look round the stadium, see the fans in. I mean, they've
[424.80 - 428.88] P:1836.50 E:0.072518 |  played every game here at Wend�, England. They know the turf, they know this stadium.
[429.52 - 433.84] P:1715.42 E:0.069836 |  What is the purpose of that? Coming out of the tunnel and just having that little walk on the
[433.84 - 441.12] P:1859.01 E:0.060472 |  pitch for five minutes. It's just like getting your mindset right. You're going on there, you feel
[441.12 - 447.04] P:1808.99 E:0.054857 |  the pitch. You've got different studs. Some players like to wear the moulds. Some players
[447.04 - 452.48] P:1713.86 E:0.060023 |  like me, the old, with no technique, the defenders. We just have big studs, you know what I mean? So
[453.12 - 457.12] P:1773.47 E:0.064891 |  it's just getting used to it and then getting used to the environment. You sort of feel the
[457.20 - 462.32] P:1675.23 E:0.059248 |  atmosphere. You see that the fans are starting to come into the stadium now and this is where your
[462.32 - 467.44] P:1677.05 E:0.052275 |  head really starts to think about how can I affect the game and that's what they'll be thinking coming
[467.44 - 473.92] P:1783.87 E:0.061560 |  out now. Let's go to the other side of the stadium. Raph Honestine is over there. They put broadcast
[473.92 - 481.04] P:1563.12 E:0.066250 |  on one side and they put written media on the other side. Raph from the Athletic, of course,
[481.04 - 486.88] P:1438.24 E:0.074518 |  afternoon. Good afternoon. I'm in the English writer's block so I don't know how that's going to
[487.84 - 494.56] P:1443.88 E:0.071709 |  affect things later on. But does that mean it, because the way I'm looking at the stadium in
[494.56 - 499.20] P:1727.91 E:0.073707 |  there, if you're in that English writer's block, are you very close to all the German fans who have
[499.20 - 505.84] P:1605.68 E:0.072465 |  that corner and one end of Wembley and many of whom are waving the German flag at the moment?
[505.84 - 510.96] P:1655.38 E:0.078837 |  Yeah, I'm the one guy with a big flag over there. No, I'm not waving the flag. I'm on the other side.
[510.96 - 516.32] P:1671.86 E:0.069796 |  I'm on the other side, the far side of the media. Okay, that side. Great. There's a good contingent
[516.32 - 523.60] P:1682.60 E:0.068488 |  here, isn't there, for Germany? Yes, it would have been more, of course, if the restrictions
[523.60 - 530.00] P:1773.72 E:0.069651 |  hadn't been the way they are. Only local German fans are allowed in, so it gives you a small idea
[530.00 - 536.88] P:1711.39 E:0.060835 |  of just how many of us are here. But it could have been more. It's a shame, really. Regular
[536.88 - 542.32] P:1807.70 E:0.071003 |  lists to Five Live will know that you've been slightly pessimistic throughout this tournament
[542.32 - 548.72] P:1838.92 E:0.068472 |  about Germany's chances and certainly a couple of their performances, particularly the last
[548.72 - 554.16] P:1834.30 E:0.066275 |  performance where they squeed through against Hungary. Has your mood changed going into this game?
[556.24 - 562.32] P:1802.45 E:0.063164 |  A little bit. A little bit. I mean, you can't help but feel excited when you go to Wembley,
[562.32 - 568.96] P:1755.60 E:0.071389 |  and you feel that maybe this Germany team will connect with its own history and will find inspiration
[569.04 - 575.92] P:1682.81 E:0.068509 |  in some of the old stories. That's the reason why I think we have more than usual invoked past
[575.92 - 581.36] P:1691.52 E:0.068407 |  triumphs in the run-up to this game, also a reflection of maybe not so much confidence in the
[581.36 - 586.88] P:1651.96 E:0.069074 |  presence right now. When you look back a lot, that doesn't really perhaps tell you much or
[586.88 - 591.20] P:1717.05 E:0.070288 |  tells you a lot about where you are at the moment, looking back might be more inspirational than
[591.20 - 598.72] P:1693.32 E:0.057508 |  looking in front of you. But I feel, I hope, especially after watching the games last night,
[599.52 - 606.16] P:1608.76 E:0.066576 |  that an England team that is better than Germany, in my view, might still allow us the kind of
[606.16 - 612.56] P:1749.96 E:0.069197 |  opportunity and maybe the chance of a small upset as we saw yesterday. So I think that gives me
[612.56 - 617.52] P:1622.16 E:0.067876 |  confidence. It's not so much about Germany now suddenly being a lot better. I think maybe the
[617.52 - 621.76] P:1691.52 E:0.069603 |  differences in the teams, even the ones that function well and those who don't function well,
[621.76 - 628.32] P:1708.98 E:0.069200 |  isn't as great at the Euros, and that gives us a chance. Do you envisage, Raph, this game being
[628.32 - 633.68] P:1607.76 E:0.067649 |  anything like some of the ones that we have seen already? And I'm not necessarily just talking
[633.68 - 639.12] P:1612.80 E:0.066306 |  about yesterday's amazing games between France and Switzerland and Spain and Croatia, but Italy,
[639.12 - 644.72] P:1755.47 E:0.064537 |  Austria had an intensity where both teams went at each other, and the majority of games have seen
[644.72 - 652.32] P:1621.18 E:0.062986 |  both sides trying to win it rather than necessarily control the game and take a 1-0. Do you envisage
[652.32 - 659.76] P:1663.96 E:0.061743 |  that today or do you expect this to be KG? It's so difficult to predict because I think Germany
[659.76 - 664.80] P:1768.24 E:0.067056 |  want to control the game but with the ball, and that in itself gives a chance for England,
[665.44 - 671.52] P:1613.70 E:0.064492 |  because if Germany don't have their passing game slick enough and accurate enough, then
[671.60 - 676.80] P:1731.04 E:0.070346 |  those spaces can be exploited and then suddenly, especially with England starting so strongly
[676.80 - 680.96] P:1723.58 E:0.068674 |  in all these games, the first 50 minutes there was real tempo, there was real pace in every single
[680.96 - 685.60] P:1611.70 E:0.069352 |  game, that's when Germany could be vulnerable. And of course if we do see an early goal then
[685.60 - 693.44] P:1610.03 E:0.060506 |  everything will open up. So it has all the hallmarks of a KG game with Southgate possibly
[693.44 - 700.64] P:1667.90 E:0.069118 |  changing its formation to meet Germany and mirror their setup and that in itself is a fairly,
[700.72 - 705.36] P:1697.53 E:0.066621 |  maybe not negative but cautious move you could say, but at the same time Germany are not very
[705.36 - 711.04] P:1660.31 E:0.069825 |  good at defending. We've already conceded five goals in three games, even if we're trying to be
[711.04 - 716.48] P:1741.65 E:0.072256 |  KG we might not succeed, so I think it should be pretty entertaining. The boost you can hear
[716.48 - 720.08] P:1705.40 E:0.063953 |  are the Germans coming out onto the pitch, although that little pocket, it's actually
[720.08 - 724.48] P:1712.27 E:0.062260 |  more than a little pocket, that medium-sized pocket of German fans away to our left,
[724.48 - 729.52] P:1771.52 E:0.063599 |  continuing to wave their flight. Do you think it will be a KG affair, Chris, or do you think it
[729.52 - 734.08] P:1711.60 E:0.062167 |  will resemble some of the other games in the last 16? It's hard to tell, I've got to say Mark,
[734.08 - 739.76] P:1722.84 E:0.061326 |  it's a very hard game to call this. If Germany turn up then we're in for a right game. England,
[739.76 - 743.12] P:1837.21 E:0.062753 |  let's be honest, have done okay, they haven't been outstanding, they've had moments,
[743.68 - 747.68] P:1819.79 E:0.062973 |  they didn't play well against Scotland, they did alright against Croatia and the Czech Republic
[747.68 - 751.92] P:1635.20 E:0.063278 |  was about basically, the Czech Republic weren't going to finish second, so I didn't really read
[751.92 - 757.12] P:1844.95 E:0.061534 |  anything like that, so it's good test for England and there's obviously a big prize waiting ahead,
[757.92 - 763.36] P:1767.38 E:0.061098 |  really will fancy their chances to get to the final, so it's a great opportunity for England,
[763.36 - 767.76] P:1876.91 E:0.060441 |  but we know, listen, Germany are a very dangerous state, yes we could see England
[767.76 - 772.16] P:1744.05 E:0.061732 |  turn it on at day and win comfortably, but if Germany turn up we know we're in for a hard,
[772.16 - 777.44] P:1749.57 E:0.058485 |  very hard game. Another question to wrap in just a second, but England have lost another wicket
[777.44 - 782.80] P:1662.04 E:0.071161 |  at the cricket, Ellie. Yeah, Owen Morgan is out now, Chappers, and having set off at an express
[782.80 - 787.76] P:1818.89 E:0.065659 |  pace with Johnny Berstow hitting 43 off 21 balls, England be calmed a little bit now,
[787.76 - 792.56] P:1861.28 E:0.068417 |  Owen Morgan just nicking through to Pereira off the bowling of Chimera for six, Joe Root is
[792.56 - 797.68] P:1720.36 E:0.067622 |  still there, he's on 11 off 11 balls, Sam Billings is the new batsman, but to having been
[797.68 - 804.64] P:1743.84 E:0.064663 |  rattling along at 11 and over it was cut considerably and now England 75 for three,
[804.64 - 807.84] P:1606.53 E:0.065277 |  and we're in the 11th over of the innings, 186 is the target.
[808.72 - 812.08] P:1873.22 E:0.061446 |  Now thank you very much, Ellie, five lives full section to listen to that, just being told that
[812.08 - 817.44] P:1856.92 E:0.062029 |  Frank De Boer has resigned as the Dutch manager they were knocked out by the Czech Republic
[817.44 - 822.32] P:1847.58 E:0.067048 |  over the weekend, so he is resigned now as the Dutch manager, one other piece of managerial news
[822.32 - 828.32] P:1821.34 E:0.059451 |  today, and Patrick Vieira is going to be the new manager at Crystal Palace. Raph just on the crowd,
[828.32 - 835.04] P:1924.29 E:0.057551 |  I mean, Wales' Chris Gunter was incredibly critical of this tournament and saying it's not
[835.04 - 839.44] P:1889.43 E:0.069331 |  very fair and it is a bit of a shambles, the travelling has to be done and who gets home fans
[839.68 - 845.12] P:1901.14 E:0.062171 |  who doesn't. Robin Gerson is ahead of today's game, the German Wimback has said,
[845.68 - 851.04] P:1909.96 E:0.065583 |  Wembley with more fans today is an additional motivation, it is great when the stadium is
[851.04 - 855.68] P:1758.54 E:0.059044 |  against you and you can silence the fans, are they going to relish this then?
[856.72 - 862.00] P:1824.77 E:0.066474 |  Well I think there's two parts to this, first of all, I think for a lot of footballers playing
[862.00 - 867.12] P:1775.76 E:0.064832 |  in front of fans still has a bit of novelty factor and excitement after the horrific
[867.92 - 873.84] P:1775.51 E:0.068382 |  quite depressing months that we've been in visit, so I think there's just a sheer sense of almost
[873.84 - 878.56] P:1669.37 E:0.069080 |  child is joy, fans are back and we haven't seen that many, in Munich there were only about 14,500,
[879.44 - 886.24] P:1664.42 E:0.065814 |  so that's one thing. The other thing is, Germany know that Wembley hasn't always worked
[886.24 - 891.52] P:1767.92 E:0.066835 |  in favour of Ringland, they know that the crowd can get a little bit anxious, they know that
[891.60 - 897.44] P:1742.29 E:0.066995 |  England teams who don't have the balls sometimes have a history of getting a bit nervous and they're
[897.44 - 903.68] P:1774.74 E:0.065868 |  trying to use that, they're trying to work with that and you'd expect them to and I think whether
[903.68 - 908.88] P:1677.80 E:0.064370 |  you know that is sort of very basic psychology, whether it works out their ways isn't possible to
[908.88 - 914.16] P:1765.41 E:0.066527 |  say, but I think they're trying to make that work and trying to get both the inspiration from the
[914.16 - 922.32] P:1804.62 E:0.062544 |  crowd and if possible maybe a sense of anxiety and impatience from the home crowd if it's possible.
[922.96 - 925.60] P:1815.09 E:0.068096 |  Do you think Wembley could work against England? Micah?
[927.04 - 934.40] P:1806.64 E:0.066128 |  No, I agree with Raff to a certain extent, but it can work both ways, if England get an early goal
[934.40 - 938.08] P:1636.22 E:0.062744 |  they're not going to have the crowd right behind them, I think they've got to use Wembley as a
[938.08 - 944.48] P:1620.44 E:0.063327 |  fortress, I agree with Raff, you know I've been playing for England where we lost to Croatia
[944.48 - 951.60] P:1684.89 E:0.060829 |  to not qualify for the Euros, so I felt that personally, but I think it's a little bit different
[951.60 - 957.12] P:1673.93 E:0.065982 |  now, even like the way that the media are, everyone seems a little bit more together, especially after
[957.12 - 961.44] P:1622.36 E:0.067438 |  the year everyone's had and I just believe that the fans will be with them right until the end of the
[961.44 - 968.48] P:1694.66 E:0.062960 |  game today, although Karen when we were here for Scotland and I know Pat never was pitch-side
[968.48 - 975.60] P:1777.57 E:0.062281 |  for us then, but for that Scotland game it did feel like it got to England during that because
[975.60 - 981.44] P:1785.79 E:0.068068 |  it was much more positive for Scotland who had that similar contingent to where the Germans are this
[981.44 - 986.96] P:1791.04 E:0.062904 |  afternoon. Yeah I can understand that, also the Scotland game they played a different shape and I
[986.96 - 992.40] P:1605.72 E:0.064542 |  think we struggle to to deal with them playing with that back five at times, but you're right in
[992.40 - 998.88] P:1676.82 E:0.068117 |  terms of the crowd and maybe the expectations, but I think there's a few, hopefully there's a few
[998.88 - 1003.28] P:1794.98 E:0.065037 |  more senior players to fit, especially after that third game, and I think we'll be able to manage
[1003.28 - 1008.08] P:1807.71 E:0.070082 |  the situation a little bit better and confident in this group, I actually feel really confident
[1008.08 - 1014.08] P:1645.95 E:0.061590 |  going into this game, we've got no fears, so I'm just really looking forward to it, they've been in
[1014.08 - 1017.20] P:1644.38 E:0.067049 |  these moments before, you know they're paid professionals at the end of the day that they'll
[1017.20 - 1026.32] P:1644.13 E:0.071458 |  be totally fine. Let's get the team news then, they are in both line-ups, England, John Murray
[1026.32 - 1032.08] P:1506.89 E:0.067126 |  are going three at the back. Yeah we can confirm that Garas Southgate is going with a change of
[1032.08 - 1040.56] P:1539.13 E:0.056792 |  formation, three four three, this is the team, Pickford, Walker, Stones and Maguire, Trippia,
[1040.56 - 1050.40] P:1597.24 E:0.058404 |  Phillips, Rice and Shaw, Saka, Kane and Sterling, so that is just the one change with Kieran Trippia
[1050.40 - 1056.32] P:1589.76 E:0.062412 |  in as the right wing bag and Jack Grealish back on the bench, just going to check Malice, yes he is
[1056.32 - 1062.56] P:1656.86 E:0.060070 |  there among the substitutes, so they've matched up the German system and they are starting with three
[1062.56 - 1067.36] P:1632.28 E:0.060162 |  central defenders for the first time since the autumn, for the first time since November against
[1067.44 - 1074.64] P:1674.60 E:0.065475 |  Iceland in the Nations League, just looking on the list of substitutes and Mason Mount is there,
[1074.64 - 1081.36] P:1707.83 E:0.063224 |  he's obviously been self-isolating until midnight last night but Ben Chilwell is not involved in the
[1081.36 - 1092.00] P:1602.92 E:0.062431 |  23 and the German side, well there is no Gunduan and no Gunabri in the German side, so Neuer-Ingol,
[1092.00 - 1098.00] P:1680.01 E:0.062908 |  three central defenders are Ginter, Hummels and Rudiger, Kimmich and Gorsens are the wing backs,
[1098.64 - 1105.20] P:1639.53 E:0.067454 |  then Guretska and Kroos in the centre of midfield in the absence of Gunduan who had a bruise on his
[1105.20 - 1111.92] P:1681.16 E:0.062417 |  head, that's why he's not involved in the starting line-up, then Havats, Muller and Timo Verna comes
[1111.92 - 1118.64] P:1589.73 E:0.060265 |  into the side for this game, so Verna and Guretska are the two that come in for Gunduan and Gunabri,
[1118.72 - 1125.28] P:1677.76 E:0.065031 |  there were doubts over Rudiger and Gorsens as well who've had a cold this week, they weren't able to
[1125.28 - 1131.12] P:1442.94 E:0.063894 |  train properly at all but they're both past fit and are in the German team. Before we let Raph go,
[1131.12 - 1135.60] P:1698.16 E:0.072066 |  let's get Raph's view on that German side, that was just mind games wasn't it on Rudiger and Gursens?
[1137.68 - 1144.88] P:1586.68 E:0.075183 |  No, not really because Gunduan is out, well he's not starting. But Rudiger and Gursens,
[1144.88 - 1151.76] P:1571.29 E:0.066273 |  we were told that colds. Yeah, I'm sure they did have colds, I don't think you'd make up a cold for
[1151.76 - 1159.92] P:1686.84 E:0.071428 |  those two particular players to scare or to lull England to a false sense of security that they
[1159.92 - 1167.52] P:1636.19 E:0.065552 |  might miss. Verna and Guretska coming in? That's a really interesting one, Guretska we all thought he
[1167.52 - 1173.92] P:1603.70 E:0.065127 |  might be in, even if Gunduan had recovered, Guretska's had such an impact against Hungary and
[1174.00 - 1179.04] P:1699.27 E:0.068954 |  he will provide a bit more muscle, a bit more dynamism and I think just having two
[1179.76 - 1184.72] P:1616.43 E:0.068345 |  ball players in the midfield was always going to be a very risky setup for this game so that's
[1184.72 - 1192.64] P:1677.02 E:0.063122 |  expected. Team Verna is not expected because Serg Gnabri has been always present for Joachim
[1192.64 - 1199.04] P:1743.37 E:0.061453 |  Luf, I think Luf a year ago said Gnabri Serg always plays for me, always plays for me. So
[1199.04 - 1203.92] P:1731.31 E:0.071534 |  whether that's a bit of an injury because he's had some muscle problems or a tactical decision to
[1203.92 - 1210.64] P:1725.99 E:0.067332 |  use the pace of Team Verna, we don't know but it's an interesting one because Verna's form
[1210.64 - 1215.12] P:1666.91 E:0.067293 |  has suffered as you know from the Premier League and it hasn't really picked up in a
[1215.12 - 1221.52] P:1626.17 E:0.064824 |  Germany shirt either so big opportunity but also big responsibility for him to show up today.
[1222.48 - 1232.24] P:1684.03 E:0.064335 |  Thanks Raph, have a good afternoon. Raph Hottestah with us on five live sport. Chris Waddle,
[1232.24 - 1237.20] P:1655.58 E:0.067585 |  what did you make of the England formation I suppose really rather than line up?
[1238.16 - 1241.92] P:1736.61 E:0.067061 |  I don't mind it, I think you've matched Germany up and if you respect the team that much,
[1241.92 - 1246.40] P:1735.50 E:0.061833 |  you've matched them up. You've got a bit of a concern about their strengths and their weaknesses,
[1246.40 - 1250.16] P:1706.97 E:0.056573 |  you're trying to find it out but what they're doing is they've gone exactly the same shape as a
[1250.16 - 1255.84] P:1360.13 E:0.060321 |  German so they believe if it's a one-on-one battle all over the park, Gareth obviously believes that
[1255.84 - 1260.00] P:1450.83 E:0.059855 |  his players will win them one-to-one battles more than a German so you can see what he's doing
[1260.56 - 1265.20] P:1509.59 E:0.055946 |  and listen this squad's developed a lot, wouldn't that Gareth? If it's not working it can easily
[1265.20 - 1268.72] P:1465.78 E:0.061182 |  change it, they've got enough players on the bench who can change the game as well so it's
[1270.08 - 1273.12] P:1529.45 E:0.067611 |  a bit cautious at first but he's obviously playing safe.
[1273.36 - 1280.48] P:1394.57 E:0.062077 |  Yeah I don't want to be glass half empty, Gareth, but if you're in the Germany
[1281.04 - 1285.44] P:1591.82 E:0.069038 |  but if you're in that German dressery do you look at the England team and go oh
[1286.16 - 1291.44] P:1489.02 E:0.069623 |  they're worried about us, they've matched us up rather than letting us worry about them,
[1291.44 - 1294.56] P:1367.29 E:0.064359 |  they're obviously worried about us and want to match up.
[1294.56 - 1300.00] P:1508.17 E:0.069624 |  I think they would have expected us to go to this formation if I'm honest because even you look at
[1300.08 - 1305.12] P:1361.95 E:0.070158 |  the press conferences they've kind of both teams have alluded to that they're not going to go at it,
[1305.12 - 1310.88] P:1558.58 E:0.059734 |  they're going to be cautious so we know the German side have always played this shape since the
[1310.88 - 1314.88] P:1458.63 E:0.070046 |  start of the tournament, I think they already knew that he was going to match them up, they've been
[1314.88 - 1319.12] P:1634.95 E:0.062075 |  preparing for this, Gareth Southgate's been preparing this formation for the latter part of
[1319.12 - 1323.36] P:1673.63 E:0.066248 |  the tournament for the last 18 months so I don't think they would have been surprised, it was just
[1323.36 - 1327.36] P:1515.83 E:0.068095 |  about which personnel they probably would have gone with and I think Saka playing in the manner that
[1327.36 - 1332.72] P:1484.94 E:0.062313 |  he did, I don't think they'll be surprised, I think they'll be like, I don't think they'll be,
[1335.28 - 1338.56] P:1422.60 E:0.066549 |  they're not going to be threatened by it but then and they're also not going to be surprised.
[1339.44 - 1346.32] P:1528.24 E:0.062192 |  I'm worried a bit down this left-hand side in terms of Germany's left-hand side,
[1346.32 - 1351.84] P:1539.48 E:0.065581 |  Trippier, I like Trippier, I like Walker, I like the way they've gone with Walker, the three at the back,
[1351.92 - 1358.24] P:1558.02 E:0.058909 |  but if you look at the runs that Werner makes, the inside runs and Gossens, I'm particularly
[1358.24 - 1364.24] P:1402.45 E:0.065862 |  interested in watching him, a wing back, full back for Atalanta, is that like 10 goals, 10 assists
[1364.24 - 1369.52] P:1460.54 E:0.063991 |  and he gets forward at every opportunity, Trippier and Walker are going to have to be
[1369.52 - 1375.92] P:1462.55 E:0.066479 |  very disciplined today but in terms of the shape of England, I think it's okay,
[1375.92 - 1382.72] P:1451.79 E:0.067144 |  we've seen yesterday's games that impact from the bench is absolutely vital, you've got Foden,
[1382.72 - 1388.32] P:1517.30 E:0.062611 |  you've got Grealish, you've got Rashford, you've got even Mount to bring on so I don't think being
[1388.32 - 1395.76] P:1275.79 E:0.064420 |  cautious for the first hour, first 60-70 minutes is necessarily a bad thing but this Germany side
[1395.76 - 1402.64] P:1467.22 E:0.061957 |  can hurt you if you give them time and space. In terms of England going forward, Saka and Stirling
[1402.64 - 1410.80] P:1680.76 E:0.062494 |  in behind will be a threat, if we look at Ginza and Hummels, they can't the cart run so I can see
[1410.80 - 1416.64] P:1702.40 E:0.068398 |  what Garo's trying to do with Pace on the wings. Yeah, look, I watched them this morning again,
[1416.64 - 1421.12] P:1707.66 E:0.071720 |  I was really trying to rack my brains and I think Mikey has spot on, the two wing backs for Germany
[1421.12 - 1425.76] P:1727.06 E:0.067393 |  are their big spread, they like to pull you apart then to attack inside and I think what's our case,
[1425.76 - 1429.60] P:1816.61 E:0.063313 |  you're right, you're just going to go and need you to go three for three, you know, they're three
[1429.60 - 1433.60] P:1651.30 E:0.065654 |  weakest players at the three at the back and we've got to go for them, the rest of the team have
[1433.60 - 1437.36] P:1617.99 E:0.066407 |  got to consolidate and defend that, they push everyone forward, we've got to hit them on the
[1437.36 - 1442.56] P:1529.99 E:0.065876 |  counter attack and you're right, England's have got to be so good in the wide areas because that's
[1442.56 - 1447.04] P:1600.45 E:0.064237 |  where Germany will threaten us, we have to start crosses, we have to get tight, get up to the ball
[1447.04 - 1450.08] P:1748.55 E:0.062441 |  because they will try and suffocate us into the half of the pitch then we've got to try and
[1450.08 - 1455.12] P:1674.96 E:0.065907 |  break on them quick. Well, if you look at Germany right, what they'll do is they're very similar to us,
[1455.12 - 1459.12] P:1728.09 E:0.060211 |  Moulin will come to the ball, he's not going to run in behind Moulin, he's like Kane, he doesn't want
[1459.12 - 1464.08] P:1755.69 E:0.062730 |  to run that way, it's not his game, he's not a target man, he wants to drag players out of areas.
[1464.08 - 1468.64] P:1807.27 E:0.059759 |  So, and then you look, apart from Kyle Walker, that back three is not very quick, we're talking
[1468.64 - 1472.72] P:1747.66 E:0.063369 |  about Hummels and getting a kind of run, I wouldn't say McGuire was late in, I definitely wouldn't say
[1472.72 - 1477.12] P:1820.74 E:0.056905 |  John Storns is late in, now that's why he's playing Verna today because he thinks, we'll
[1477.12 - 1480.88] P:1724.98 E:0.061406 |  salt the pressure up, get the full backs, the wing backs a little bit ahead, get down the side of
[1480.88 - 1484.88] P:1614.99 E:0.061633 |  McGuire, get down the side, you're not going to get joy against Kyle Walker that way, but if you can get
[1484.88 - 1488.56] P:1849.88 E:0.063346 |  between them centre halves or down the sides of them two percent offs, they'll fancy their chances
[1488.56 - 1493.20] P:1691.01 E:0.061182 |  on the counter attack, well that was a shell of a doubt. So, it is really matched up game, we're
[1493.20 - 1498.64] P:1861.63 E:0.057745 |  talking about the German back three, it's not the most mobile, good in here as the England one is,
[1498.64 - 1504.16] P:1848.53 E:0.056865 |  but one's pretty quick in the other two or not. So, they're very, very similar, midfield, not
[1504.16 - 1509.52] P:1859.60 E:0.062433 |  linear, you'd probably say gets forward more, Cruz is very good on the ball, he's closing down,
[1510.40 - 1512.88] P:1740.44 E:0.064361 |  can create a lot of problems if he's given time and space,
[1513.84 - 1517.20] P:1729.97 E:0.059022 |  Err, race in Phillips, they've got their work cut out in there, but I would feel
[1518.08 - 1522.40] P:1670.38 E:0.060383 |  physically and mentally they could dominate them too, but they're very, very clever players.
[1523.12 - 1528.64] P:1679.67 E:0.063048 |  So, just a couple of things out of all of that, and this isn't a dig at Manchester City here,
[1528.64 - 1535.20] P:1663.56 E:0.061622 |  Michael, before you take it as such, but I wonder whether Jürgen Loha in any way has looked at the
[1535.20 - 1541.60] P:1605.81 E:0.064300 |  Verna-Karl-Walker battle in FA Cup semi-final, Champions League, so on and so forth, and all
[1541.60 - 1545.28] P:1641.39 E:0.064487 |  right, we'll see what we can do with that to try and settle Karl Walker with that.
[1546.48 - 1552.80] P:1524.46 E:0.061242 |  Yeah, I think just Verna in general, I think Verna's similar to Marat, where Marat has got
[1552.80 - 1557.04] P:1723.84 E:0.058382 |  really good movement and someone's Verna, he frustrates people because he gets in these
[1557.04 - 1562.96] P:1681.54 E:0.058144 |  grey areas and doesn't finish it off, I think that's a very valid point in terms of, you know,
[1562.96 - 1568.80] P:1644.95 E:0.056469 |  Walker and Verna matching up for Chelsea and Manchester City, but I think Verna was going
[1568.88 - 1575.60] P:1638.36 E:0.058438 |  to play regardless of what, not because of his runs in behind, I think if we're talking about
[1575.60 - 1581.60] P:1609.52 E:0.057889 |  runs in behind, like Walker's the only one, like Chris said, who's got a bit of pace, so I just think
[1581.60 - 1586.64] P:1645.44 E:0.053570 |  they've looked at England's defending for, we can get out this defence, but I think it's pretty
[1586.64 - 1591.28] P:1602.43 E:0.064740 |  even, both teams are very even and it's who turns up on the day, Chris is totally right.
[1591.92 - 1598.80] P:1597.48 E:0.058160 |  And then, Karen, if you're looking at where England can exploit Germany's defence on the
[1598.80 - 1603.76] P:1704.87 E:0.060938 |  pace side and hit them quickly on the break, I wonder how critical Calvin Phillips will be
[1603.76 - 1608.88] P:1802.67 E:0.059130 |  to that given his range of passing? Yeah, totally, get it off the back line, keep spraying it,
[1608.88 - 1612.88] P:1894.51 E:0.064778 |  first pass forward as quick as possible, you know, the margins are going to be so small,
[1612.88 - 1619.20] P:1852.98 E:0.058689 |  so you've just got to hit the front player as quick as possible, Sterling, Saka, just get on it,
[1619.20 - 1623.92] P:1858.91 E:0.063771 |  see the space in behind, make sure you just run and penetrate, the back three is quick as possible,
[1623.92 - 1629.60] P:1628.87 E:0.063167 |  but Phillips, you'll have to be both fantastic in that position, keep screening that free in
[1629.60 - 1634.00] P:1632.41 E:0.060543 |  front of him, protecting, and as soon as he's got the opportunity, get that range out with his passing.
[1635.28 - 1641.60] P:1636.30 E:0.065578 |  Just one final thing on the selection here for England, Chris, and that'll bring you all in on
[1641.60 - 1648.40] P:1578.78 E:0.057820 |  this, which is, Vakaya Sakharin has played as a win back this season for Arsenal, he's played right
[1648.40 - 1654.40] P:1665.17 E:0.060194 |  and he's played left. Now, if you hadn't played trippier but say had started Saka as a right
[1654.40 - 1659.28] P:1656.42 E:0.058456 |  win back, you could have then maybe brought Mountain or Fodenin or you could have had Greenleash in,
[1659.28 - 1663.60] P:1662.08 E:0.066702 |  and there'd also be a bit more versatility in that line, wouldn't there, in being able to switch
[1663.60 - 1668.32] P:1540.88 E:0.057094 |  between a three at the back and a four at the back if they needed to? I don't think he can really
[1668.32 - 1672.48] P:1699.37 E:0.069060 |  move Saka after his glass game, I thought he was very positive, he carries the ball ever so well,
[1672.48 - 1675.92] P:1558.60 E:0.061980 |  he's very positive, he runs at you, people don't like that, defenders don't like that,
[1675.92 - 1680.32] P:1694.40 E:0.058497 |  any defender doesn't, so, and when he's got a decent pace about him as well, so I think he had
[1680.32 - 1684.24] P:1751.37 E:0.067476 |  to leave him where he was, he got the man of the match performance in the last game, you've had to
[1684.24 - 1689.44] P:1715.99 E:0.062139 |  say look, we'll go again. As I said before, this England team is very flexible, you can change it
[1689.44 - 1694.80] P:1779.93 E:0.058179 |  to a four, you can go three at the back, you can go four, four, two if you want, you can change the
[1694.80 - 1700.88] P:1765.57 E:0.058074 |  system very easy, and listen, I'm sure if the game goes on, subs will come on because not just
[1700.88 - 1705.04] P:1707.35 E:0.063559 |  because of change in the game, physically, a lot of these players have played non-stop football
[1705.68 - 1710.16] P:1598.96 E:0.060992 |  a year, and you can see some of them are feeling the pace, not just the England players, the German
[1710.16 - 1715.44] P:1627.62 E:0.053576 |  players as well. I think what we have to be careful of is we've got Rice and Philips, and
[1715.44 - 1720.00] P:1696.32 E:0.060323 |  before the tournament we were talking about them as defensive players, I think Philips has shown
[1720.00 - 1726.24] P:1652.93 E:0.054157 |  he can be more offensive, but we can't allow the gap between Saka, Kane, Sterling and Rice and Philips
[1726.24 - 1730.88] P:1632.96 E:0.061508 |  to become too big because at times, you know, there's going to be times where England are going to
[1730.88 - 1736.64] P:1649.16 E:0.054813 |  have to drop off, and they're going to have seven defensive players on the pitch, and sometimes you
[1736.64 - 1743.92] P:1735.12 E:0.059329 |  do need that link between the midfield and TAC, and not just throw hopeless balls forward and expect
[1743.92 - 1750.48] P:1720.93 E:0.060694 |  Saka and Sterling to go and get them, got to play forward with real quality, so whether it's Rice or
[1750.48 - 1754.56] P:1618.66 E:0.058556 |  Philips, sometimes they're going to have to break the lines and try to be playing them through balls.
[1755.12 - 1757.20] P:1671.87 E:0.064231 |  Did one performance make Saka undroppable?
[1758.16 - 1764.32] P:1564.99 E:0.060166 |  I think Chris is totally right. I think this last game, he was magnificent, and sometimes the
[1764.32 - 1770.40] P:1652.49 E:0.061159 |  managers, you know, it didn't start the two games before that. It comes in, he was a brilliant player.
[1770.40 - 1772.96] P:1658.66 E:0.067829 |  He wasn't even in the 23 for one of those games.
[1772.96 - 1777.04] P:1713.93 E:0.061976 |  He played really well at Middlesbrough, didn't he? The friendlies at Middlesbrough, he played,
[1777.04 - 1780.56] P:1767.11 E:0.072675 |  and he played really, really scored. He scored as well, he played really well. He looked apart,
[1780.56 - 1784.72] P:1696.69 E:0.065552 |  and I remember we were watching the game and said he wouldn't be a problem if he had to throw him
[1785.04 - 1788.32] P:1655.90 E:0.065175 |  into the starting line-up. He had a little bit of a hip injury, if you remember,
[1789.12 - 1794.16] P:1721.85 E:0.067617 |  in the walk after that warm-up game when he scored his first goal and missed a bit of training,
[1794.16 - 1797.68] P:1617.05 E:0.062201 |  so I think that was the reason that perhaps he wasn't part of the picture right at the start.
[1798.80 - 1805.04] P:1800.86 E:0.069063 |  This is Five Lives Sport at Wembley, where the rain is falling. England against Germany in the
[1805.04 - 1812.00] P:2002.13 E:0.063218 |  last 16 is an hour away. You can watch it on BBC Television as well. It's on BBC One. If you go to

[1818.80 - 1824.48] P:1945.71 E:0.062541 |  We're also across the tennis and the cricket this afternoon as well. Let's start at Wimbledon and
[1824.48 - 1830.16] P:1900.00 E:0.058968 |  Russell Fuller. Where the rain is also falling. No play on the outside courts before 4.30,
[1830.16 - 1835.52] P:1764.50 E:0.063365 |  but under the roof on Centre Court. Roger Federer has just arrived at the start of his 22nd
[1835.52 - 1840.80] P:1772.92 E:0.064778 |  consecutive Wimbledon Championships. He's playing Adrian Manorino of France while on court number
[1840.80 - 1845.52] P:1771.28 E:0.061833 |  one also under the roof, Angelique Kerber, a German player who loves her football and will be
[1845.52 - 1850.32] P:1801.49 E:0.060916 |  keen to get off court as quickly as possible. It's 5-4 up with a break in the first set against
[1850.32 - 1856.72] P:1894.77 E:0.064066 |  Nina Stojanovic. Results earlier today have seen Venus Williams at the age of 41 reach the second
[1856.72 - 1861.84] P:1787.03 E:0.067407 |  round and also the world number one, Ashley Barty of Australia, who beat Carlos Suarez Navarro of
[1861.84 - 1866.96] P:1823.96 E:0.052812 |  Spain 6-1 in the deciding set. England are wobbling in the cricket a little bit. Ellie?
[1867.04 - 1872.96] P:1862.64 E:0.070313 |  Yeah, four wickets down now. Chappers 89 for four at the drinks break. They need another 97 runs
[1872.96 - 1876.88] P:1679.20 E:0.063101 |  from 36 over, so they've got plenty of time to get it. Although ideally, I think a lot of people
[1876.88 - 1880.40] P:1744.15 E:0.066034 |  in the crowd would have wanted it to be over a little bit quicker than it looks like it's going
[1880.40 - 1886.16] P:1874.82 E:0.068831 |  to be, but Sam Billings was out for three. He was the latest man to go. Chimera has taken two wickets,
[1886.16 - 1891.28] P:1776.73 E:0.063307 |  caught at backward points, Sam Billings, and then Mowee and Allie dropped behind the stumps by Pereira
[1891.28 - 1896.96] P:1926.95 E:0.063779 |  off the very first ball that he faced. He's still there though. He's on one Joe Root, 22 off 24 balls,
[1896.96 - 1901.52] P:1974.01 E:0.064857 |  so this is very much changed around from when Johnny Berstow was smashing it to all parts,
[1901.52 - 1906.64] P:1865.34 E:0.061953 |  getting 43 off 21 balls. England 89 for four, chasing 186 to win.
[1907.20 - 1911.36] P:2002.66 E:0.062348 |  If you're just tuning in, England are going to play three at the back against Germany this
[1911.36 - 1917.68] P:1928.90 E:0.061441 |  afternoon. Pickford in goal, Walker, Stones and McGuire is the back three. Short and Trippier are
[1917.68 - 1924.64] P:1847.63 E:0.055720 |  the wind backs, then Phillips and Rice and Saka and Sterling either side of Kane will continue

[2107.60 - 2117.04] P:1684.28 E:0.086434 |  Available now on BBC Sounds. The wait is over. Euro 2020 with Mark Chapman on BBC Radio Five Life.
[2118.16 - 2125.52] P:2009.73 E:0.059391 |  Afternoon, this is Five Life Sport as England take on Germany in the Euros at Wembley again.
[2130.40 - 2133.92] P:1486.58 E:0.075230 |  Hello again, glad you've tuned in. You've obviously heard there's a football match on tonight.
[2133.92 - 2139.20] P:1509.23 E:0.074815 |  England against Germany, the second semi-final of Euro 96, sporting history waiting to be made.
[2139.20 - 2141.36] P:1407.56 E:0.072052 |  Here comes the corner teed in by Gasquad.
[2141.36 - 2148.48] P:1699.50 E:0.091804 |  Little head on and Shearer's there and scores for England. England have scored after only two minutes.
[2148.48 - 2151.60] P:1657.11 E:0.093460 |  It's an absolutely dream start to the semi-final.
[2151.60 - 2156.96] P:1679.87 E:0.087727 |  And where was the marker for Alan Shearer? They're not complaining, the ball's in the back of the net and a wonderful start.
[2156.96 - 2161.20] P:1553.88 E:0.082844 |  In goes Gontz and it's an equaliser from Germany. I love this goal.
[2161.20 - 2165.52] P:1553.45 E:0.087721 |  Let us hope we get a golden goal. Let's hope we get a goal and we don't go to those penalties once more.
[2165.52 - 2169.52] P:1479.17 E:0.093994 |  Oh and it's headed from Gontz in the back of the net for the Ripper East is allowed in.
[2169.52 - 2174.08] P:1591.76 E:0.093170 |  He loses it, my guess is going. I don't believe it.
[2174.08 - 2179.12] P:1386.27 E:0.086445 |  Organising for the players to have to go through this again and it's tough on us all.
[2179.12 - 2188.08] P:1687.67 E:0.089867 |  Steppen Gontz to keep Germany in Euro 96. Here he comes, high into the Ripper the net and it's five five.
[2188.16 - 2190.16] P:1559.11 E:0.086621 |  But we're moving on now to sudden death.
[2190.16 - 2200.16] P:1615.55 E:0.084428 |  And Gareth Southgate who has been magnificent at the heart of England's defence now has to score a goal to keep England going in the European Championship.
[2200.16 - 2206.32] P:1633.67 E:0.086043 |  Here he comes. Oh and it's been saved by Kopka. Kopka dives to his right.
[2206.32 - 2212.24] P:1541.63 E:0.077996 |  Gareth Southgate didn't really strike it cleanly. He looks down, he looks for lawn.
[2212.40 - 2220.40] P:1612.52 E:0.077302 |  The other players going to try and console Gareth Southgate but there is no consolation unless he can be saved by David Steeve.
[2220.40 - 2225.20] P:1780.71 E:0.080962 |  Seaman has been their hero for England throughout the championship. He has to be again.
[2225.20 - 2233.20] P:1641.58 E:0.078305 |  Muller comes up and it's a goal for Germany and as in Turin six years ago the Germans held the nerve better.
[2233.20 - 2235.20] P:1617.77 E:0.083742 |  The dream dissolves for England.
[2236.16 - 2244.16] P:1265.48 E:0.078993 |  I'm disappointed that I've let down not only the nation but more importantly the lads in there who've worked so hard.
[2244.16 - 2250.16] P:1639.45 E:0.083869 |  It's so so tough on the man who doesn't score.
[2250.16 - 2256.16] P:1215.30 E:0.075027 |  The euphoria that the whole country was feeling has come to an end but there you go I've got to live with that and I've got to go with it.
[2256.16 - 2262.16] P:1613.38 E:0.075953 |  It's been such a success in this championship. It proved himself to be a true international player.
[2263.12 - 2265.12] P:1553.87 E:0.079074 |  It will be better days for him.
[2265.12 - 2277.12] P:1290.42 E:0.081624 |  We're ready for it. We know it's a very difficult challenge. It's a great opportunity for this team to make some history and give people memories of England and Germany fixtures for the future.
[2277.12 - 2285.12] P:1123.00 E:0.085989 |  Some of the ones they've been flooded with over the last few days which mean absolutely nothing to them because they weren't born for most of them.
[2286.08 - 2294.08] P:1503.08 E:0.088105 |  Well that was then but this is now the rain continuing to fall here at Wembley.
[2294.08 - 2304.08] P:1614.21 E:0.070425 |  The cones are out for both sides to come out and warm up which they will do shortly and England against Germany is 50 minutes away.
[2304.08 - 2312.08] P:1734.24 E:0.064376 |  Full commentary here on Five Live. You can watch it on BBC One as well. Chris Waddell and John Murray will be your commentary team.
[2313.04 - 2323.04] P:1671.44 E:0.062509 |  I think Karen Carney is pitch-side. Michael Richards is alongside me which is slightly problematic because people keep coming up for selfies with him.
[2323.04 - 2331.04] P:1739.31 E:0.068979 |  I thought somebody was coming not long ago and I started to get a little bit annoyed and I was thinking surely not someone else but it turned out it was Jermaine Jeansus just coming to say hello.
[2331.04 - 2335.04] P:1721.61 E:0.076241 |  Did you ask for a selfie with Michael or everyone else?
[2335.04 - 2337.04] P:1707.75 E:0.063563 |  I did want one but he said no.
[2338.00 - 2340.00] P:1779.21 E:0.076936 |  He's changed.
[2342.00 - 2352.00] P:1810.13 E:0.067687 |  Jermaine, part of the BBC One commentary team. Do you view this as sensible matching up Germany or overly cautious?
[2352.96 - 2362.96] P:1615.23 E:0.063557 |  I think from a formation perspective I don't blame Gareth for matching them up. I wouldn't say that we've exactly lit the tournament a light with four at the back
[2362.96 - 2368.96] P:1398.57 E:0.062599 |  and whether it's a kind of two holders and a number ten of whether we've played a one with two eights in that midfield.
[2368.96 - 2378.96] P:1396.47 E:0.062843 |  I think matching them up was probably sensible whether the personnel match the formation is another question.
[2379.92 - 2383.92] P:1607.06 E:0.063594 |  There's no bench here well in the squad at all by the looks of it.
[2383.92 - 2391.92] P:1719.96 E:0.068421 |  We saw what him and Rhys James did in the Champions League final. They're much more natural wing backs in comparison to what Luke Shaw is and Kieran Trippier.
[2391.92 - 2397.92] P:1726.40 E:0.065065 |  He's with them week in week out. He's been watching them and he understands exactly what they bring to the table.
[2397.92 - 2403.92] P:1781.86 E:0.062184 |  Kieran Trippier is there obviously for set pieces and it's very defensive but I don't blame him.
[2404.88 - 2408.88] P:1793.51 E:0.062445 |  I think after seeing yesterday's games everyone's just gone hang on a minute.
[2408.88 - 2412.88] P:1601.22 E:0.069312 |  Let me just play it safe a little bit because this is absolutely mental.
[2412.88 - 2422.88] P:1693.87 E:0.064098 |  That's a really interesting point because yesterday was one of the great days of international football.
[2422.88 - 2430.88] P:1714.22 E:0.058983 |  But also Portugal went health and leather against Belgium in that second half and could break them down.
[2431.84 - 2435.84] P:1657.75 E:0.063537 |  The European Union and Austria was a really intense game.
[2435.84 - 2441.84] P:1592.18 E:0.065312 |  Czech Republic against the Dutch were fantastic and went for it and Denmark against Wales went for it.
[2441.84 - 2445.84] P:1674.44 E:0.065764 |  It'd be nice to see both teams go for it.
[2445.84 - 2453.84] P:1727.95 E:0.061239 |  I think the game, the environment, the conditions, it lends itself to that to just happen anyway.
[2454.80 - 2460.80] P:1546.68 E:0.067277 |  Michael and Chris will tell you the games that you play and sometimes as footballers that you think we're going to have some control in there.
[2460.80 - 2466.80] P:1539.55 E:0.067619 |  Or we might sit a little bit deep and the emotions of the game take over, a big tackle flies in or a big chance.
[2466.80 - 2474.80] P:1528.90 E:0.063762 |  Before you know it the game can get away from you and turn into I suppose much more of a Premier League type game than we're used to.
[2474.80 - 2478.80] P:1543.83 E:0.063371 |  That's what the players have to control. They have to control their emotions today, play the game.
[2479.76 - 2487.76] P:1429.54 E:0.068869 |  It could be slow. England have played the tournament very slow up to date but there's no doubt that they're due a performance that shows a lot more energy.
[2487.76 - 2493.76] P:1605.36 E:0.066343 |  JJ, from a midfielder's point of view, you've got Rice and Philips in there.
[2493.76 - 2497.76] P:1532.36 E:0.064639 |  I know we've been playing sometimes a free midfielder so we're playing one holder and two.
[2497.76 - 2505.76] P:1647.53 E:0.055112 |  You see Philips go play more number eight. How do you see in terms of offensively how that can work with linking up with Sakagin?
[2506.72 - 2516.72] P:1599.58 E:0.058842 |  When you get into a deep block defensive position how are you going to play the ball forward to same Kane and Sterling with that quality?
[2516.72 - 2522.72] P:1633.91 E:0.062276 |  To be honest with you, I think in this type of formation the wing backs are your key.
[2522.72 - 2530.72] P:1661.01 E:0.063930 |  They need to be high and wide which then allows Sterling to play a little bit more central and it allows Sakagin to play a little bit more central off Kane.
[2531.68 - 2539.68] P:1550.35 E:0.065423 |  Kane will naturally want to come deep so you need your wing backs high and wide making those runs threatening in behind.
[2539.68 - 2543.68] P:1529.52 E:0.065424 |  But then the lights of Sakagin and Sterling can create overloads if they want to help form that link.
[2543.68 - 2549.68] P:1577.98 E:0.059826 |  So you almost get like a box effect in that midfield. So you have your two sitters and Sterling can just drop a little bit.
[2549.68 - 2557.68] P:1460.15 E:0.061570 |  Sakagin can drop a little bit if he wants as long as your wing backs are high and wide to provide that width and stretching teams that you need.
[2558.64 - 2564.64] P:1522.51 E:0.061205 |  We played the system obviously back in the World Cup in Russia and we've kind of flirted with it every now and again.
[2564.64 - 2570.64] P:1758.27 E:0.066396 |  For me those wing backs are not natural wing backs today so whether they do that job or not is yet to be seen.
[2570.64 - 2578.64] P:1715.82 E:0.063683 |  Just one final thing on what we've seen in the last 16 Chris and myself and Mike have touched on it very briefly last night on the highlights.
[2578.64 - 2582.64] P:1753.95 E:0.062127 |  Which is with five substitutions and actually a sixth if you go into extra time.
[2583.60 - 2589.60] P:1693.30 E:0.063715 |  You're ending up with half of your players with fresh legs and half being absolutely knackered.
[2589.60 - 2593.60] P:1779.76 E:0.068235 |  And particularly if you keep your defenders on who are knackered and change your attackers.
[2593.60 - 2599.60] P:1605.73 E:0.059727 |  And I wonder if that's a reason as well why we've seen the entertainment and the thrilling games.
[2599.60 - 2603.60] P:1572.51 E:0.064765 |  Yeah definitely I think as I said earlier the players have had a long year.
[2603.60 - 2609.60] P:1831.27 E:0.065054 |  I've normally had a break. They've just played football non-stop with games in the clubs and in the national football as well.
[2610.56 - 2614.56] P:1750.71 E:0.067531 |  A lot of players are running on an empty so the subs are key today.
[2614.56 - 2618.56] P:1689.68 E:0.063921 |  Simple as you know the system is not working. Listen if you look at it they've matched up right.
[2618.56 - 2622.56] P:1601.51 E:0.058569 |  And it's who plays on the day. The two's having a good game and the other's having a bad game.
[2622.56 - 2626.56] P:1694.93 E:0.065658 |  The ones who have a bad game unfortunately you've got to make a change. You've got to make a decision and change it.
[2626.56 - 2631.56] P:1664.55 E:0.069706 |  But if you look they just basically matched up on each other and it's who against who who's going to win the battles.
[2631.56 - 2633.56] P:1580.49 E:0.065251 |  And that's going to say who wins the game.
[2633.56 - 2636.56] P:1475.66 E:0.066564 |  The teams have fallen apart Chappers. You look at France yesterday.
[2637.52 - 2641.52] P:1492.66 E:0.075223 |  Hamstring is getting pulled. Carps getting pulled.
[2641.52 - 2649.52] P:1352.66 E:0.066372 |  It's not surprising but again you know it goes down to kind of you know maybe the way that we have played with slow build-up and just nicking games here and there.
[2649.52 - 2656.52] P:1295.57 E:0.067778 |  You know Garif maybe knows the kind of level of the team and has been trying to get them to a certain point where they peak at the right time.
[2656.52 - 2660.52] P:1256.67 E:0.068053 |  And we're going into that phase now. There's no time to wait anymore. This is it now.
[2660.52 - 2668.52] P:1492.07 E:0.066179 |  I honestly think though that if you're playing in the Premier League weekend we're playing 45-55 games. Champions League it's a lot harder than playing in the Czech League.
[2668.52 - 2679.52] P:1480.29 E:0.065916 |  And it's a lot harder playing in there. So the teams who have come in through and surprised people if you actually look at their games how many have played a season they've played 10-15 less in a lesser league.
[2679.52 - 2684.52] P:1495.83 E:0.065231 |  So they are fresher. I don't care what anybody says. If you're playing in the top league it's a grain every week.
[2684.52 - 2690.52] P:1600.70 E:0.070213 |  And you've got your Champions League. You've got the international in every way wants to beat England. So that's another level you've got to keep rising all the time.
[2690.52 - 2696.52] P:1540.57 E:0.063926 |  Nobody suspects the Czech is enough. But if you play in the Czech League it's not as hard as playing in the Premier League like now.
[2696.52 - 2705.52] P:1452.97 E:0.069348 |  One quick one though Chris on kind of conditioning and stuff like that because what major tournament you were there obviously Italian 90s was you were 86.
[2705.52 - 2712.52] P:1473.55 E:0.069009 |  So the conditions in 86 were ridiculous you know from a temperature point of view pitches that were sliding all over the place.
[2712.52 - 2721.52] P:1268.04 E:0.069620 |  And then obviously Italian 90 was again from a heat perspective very very hot. We've never had it as good in a major tournament as an English team ever.
[2721.52 - 2728.52] P:1453.59 E:0.068454 |  You know I was in Germany 2006 it was boiling hot every single game and it affects you as an English player. It just does. This is perfect.
[2728.52 - 2739.52] P:1332.50 E:0.070479 |  It's like the middle of the season in the Premier League and I would expect us right now to be back to our peak and really imposing ourselves physically on this team with the youth that we have.
[2739.52 - 2750.52] P:1575.31 E:0.073233 |  But you've seen a lot of teams aren't you Belgium dropping like they couldn't walk off. They're older. Belgium's got some young players in the prime but they couldn't let some of them want you to carry it off early today.
[2750.52 - 2757.52] P:1670.79 E:0.070603 |  So you know you look at Spain and Croatia has to cross out put a spell on half an hour and then they die to get they collapsed again.
[2757.52 - 2770.52] P:1511.79 E:0.072237 |  And you can say they've got some more players. They've never stopped playing football for a year and it's really demanded and we're saying people get injured and people start basically putting their hand up saying get me off.
[2770.52 - 2778.52] P:1433.14 E:0.075598 |  Manuel Neuer and the rest of the German goalkeeping contingent have come out which is why you can hear the boos initially.
[2778.52 - 2784.52] P:1586.41 E:0.072703 |  But they're warming up in front of that corner of German fans. So then you heard the cheers as they went over there.
[2784.52 - 2789.52] P:1625.47 E:0.068164 |  Jermaine, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you very much. You're off to go and do your TV stuff now.
[2789.52 - 2795.52] P:1365.28 E:0.077314 |  I'm going to get a picture later please. Thank you. You're going with the big boys now aren't you?
[2795.52 - 2801.52] P:1570.57 E:0.070661 |  Jermaine G. This part of the BBC TV commentary team. This afternoon we've talked about substitutions.
[2801.52 - 2807.52] P:1461.20 E:0.064162 |  John Murray, do you just want to mention the three England players who haven't... I think this is a ridiculous rule.
[2807.52 - 2811.52] P:1220.16 E:0.069099 |  I don't think he cares about it but it is a ridiculous rule.
[2811.52 - 2819.52] P:1460.40 E:0.072289 |  Yeah, I think many people agree with you Mark. The three who are not involved, as I mentioned Ben Chilwell is not involved for understandable reasons.
[2819.52 - 2824.52] P:1637.62 E:0.066488 |  Ben White, but interesting, it's Chris that's spotted this actually and I think it's a really interesting discussion point.
[2824.52 - 2833.52] P:1358.36 E:0.063116 |  No Dominic Kalvatt-Lewin on the bench for England when we've considered him all the way through to be the man if anything should happen to Harry Kane.
[2833.52 - 2838.52] P:1429.79 E:0.064572 |  Just out of interest the three Germans who aren't in the 26th, Klosterman, Gunter and Hoffman.
[2838.52 - 2848.52] P:1527.33 E:0.066576 |  Well we started this hour by playing you a mix from Euro 96, 25 years and three days it is now since that semi-final,
[2848.52 - 2854.52] P:1494.12 E:0.060204 |  Gaskoins late miss, couldn't quite reach the ball, could he? Southgate's penalty in Germany winning.
[2854.52 - 2860.52] P:1450.00 E:0.060977 |  Harry Kane says that match, not surprisingly, won't be a consideration for this group.
[2860.52 - 2865.52] P:1379.65 E:0.051740 |  I'll be totally honest, I reckon the majority of the players don't even remember that game.
[2865.52 - 2873.52] P:1955.80 E:0.046290 |  A lot of them weren't even born, I think I was only three years old. Of course you see highlights and stuff like that but the bottom line is we've moved on,
[2873.52 - 2884.52] P:1904.96 E:0.050865 |  we're a different team, we're a different squad, we've won penalty shootouts in the last three, four years so the most important thing from our point of view is that we're trying to get the job done in 90 minutes
[2884.52 - 2893.52] P:1871.02 E:0.051678 |  and if called upon we'll be ready to do whatever it takes. As players we don't need no more added motivation to go out there and show our country what we can do.
[2893.52 - 2903.52] P:1883.52 E:0.048353 |  Every time you're pouring an England shirt it's an extremely proud moment and you want to do yourself, your family, your friends, your country proud and that's the same no matter who we play.
[2903.52 - 2909.52] P:1774.84 E:0.041978 |  It's a big game at Wembley, hopefully we can get the fans right behind us and obviously try and come out the winners.
[2909.52 - 2919.52] P:1944.09 E:0.057874 |  How did you feel Harry at the moment that realisation hit, that it was going to be Germany? You're going to captain England against Germany in a tournament match at Wembley?
[2920.52 - 2933.52] P:1783.68 E:0.053605 |  Obviously for a moment it could have been any team in that group, it was chopping and changing so of course there was excitement, it's going to be a hugely proud moment walking out at Wembley in front of our fans in a knockout game
[2933.52 - 2947.52] P:1887.56 E:0.043979 |  and obviously against a big nation like Germany will be hopefully a memory that will stick with me and the team forever if we get the job done so that's our focus, that's the most important thing and I'm looking forward to trying to achieve that.
[2948.52 - 2958.52] P:1850.41 E:0.058156 |  Chris Waddle, Micah Richards, Karen Carney, Pitchside listening to Harry Kane there, John Murray our correspondent with us. History is irrelevant isn't it?
[2958.52 - 2971.52] P:1696.07 E:0.061835 |  Yeah but I think he had a good point there, he was three when they played in 96, he wasn't even thought of probably in 90 so it is the right new chapter, the right in history.
[2971.52 - 2980.52] P:1777.90 E:0.068465 |  You look back and obviously 66 always comes up because that's the last two of you will be winning, oh good, so there's always going to be yes but I do think we...
[2980.52 - 2992.52] P:1737.53 E:0.059538 |  But in 1990 when you played against Germany in the World Cup semi-final did 66 have any bearing on you at all?
[2992.52 - 3008.52] P:1802.00 E:0.062543 |  It did because we thought we were going to win it so we thought if we get the final we could win it and we knew it was all in that German game so we all thought we've got a chance here of basically copying the 66 lock so it did get mentioned a couple of times
[3008.52 - 3016.52] P:1826.61 E:0.064170 |  If we win it, imagine that because we haven't won anything since 66, now in 96 they probably thought we haven't won a trophy since 66 so yes it would have been brought up.
[3016.52 - 3026.52] P:1791.10 E:0.061968 |  Look at history at rates itself, now this team going win and they're going to win the tournament, they never really be taught those teams for years and years, you never really want to match it.
[3026.52 - 3044.52] P:1758.47 E:0.060893 |  If they were being managed by a manager who makes it all about himself and I can think of a couple who do do that but Southgate has never made it about himself therefore even the argument let's go and do it for the manager because of what happened 25 years ago.
[3044.52 - 3048.52] P:1875.10 E:0.065637 |  I'm not sure Southgate would even want them thinking like that, would he, Micah?
[3048.52 - 3071.52] P:1544.50 E:0.069767 |  No, no, no, he's not. Since Southgate has come into this squad he's been a revelation, he's been excellent the way he speaks, the way he handles himself, the way he has to discipline players but then he doesn't hold it against him, he gives everyone another chance and you can see that within the group, you can see it in the way they play.
[3071.52 - 3087.52] P:1629.90 E:0.067835 |  Yes we would have liked them to play a little bit more, you know, better football in terms of what they've got available to them but I just think Southgate is a class act and he wouldn't want the players to make it about him because he's not that sort of person.
[3087.52 - 3090.52] P:1647.13 E:0.070737 |  I mean if they go and do it for him, it'll be so after him.
[3090.52 - 3099.52] P:1707.94 E:0.070003 |  After him they're great but if you were in that dressing room you wouldn't be going, well let's go and do it for the manager to avenge what happened 25 years ago when most of us weren't even born.
[3099.52 - 3101.52] P:1670.83 E:0.062115 |  You wouldn't be saying that would you?
[3101.52 - 3110.52] P:1438.13 E:0.068257 |  No, you wouldn't be saying that Chapters but you know Chris is right, it's exactly what he said, like you always look back in history.
[3110.52 - 3120.52] P:1565.52 E:0.071422 |  No matter what, when we was playing Germany under 16s, under 17s, under 18s, all up to 21s, we know Germany is a big game and why do we know it's a big game?
[3120.52 - 3130.52] P:1606.18 E:0.075149 |  It's because of history, yes they're not going to be going out and saying let's avenge this and this is Southgate's redemption but at the end of the day you listen to the history chapters.
[3131.52 - 3137.52] P:1766.41 E:0.085103 |  The cheers you can hear are as England come out to warm up here at Wembley.
[3137.52 - 3149.52] P:1709.12 E:0.075708 |  Germany came out a couple of moments ago, Harry Kane leading the team out and it's red tracksuit up, he's got blue tracksuit bottoms on, most of the rest of the team just wearing their white shorts and white socks.
[3149.52 - 3158.52] P:1626.95 E:0.074842 |  Declan Rice has run out like a kid in a sweet shop waving and smiling, I'm assuming he's good, wasn't he then? Chris Torey.
[3158.52 - 3167.52] P:1586.18 E:0.078920 |  I'm assuming he's got friends and family in a tier near us but he was waving, he was smiling, he was virtually skipping, he was hitting the badge on his chest, wasn't he Chris?
[3167.52 - 3176.52] P:1571.34 E:0.077703 |  He's in holiday running down the beach running, he was waving and everybody was wondering I thought he was going to dive into the sea unfortunately there's not one there but I thought he was on holiday.
[3176.52 - 3179.52] P:1673.70 E:0.071780 |  Has he got a caravan or something at the back of you?
[3179.52 - 3187.52] P:1599.52 E:0.075209 |  I mean I'm hoping he's that relaxed carrot throughout the whole of this game, he looked absolutely buzzed in Declan Rice as he came out.
[3187.52 - 3196.52] P:1692.86 E:0.068840 |  Now it's fantastic, you know, they all look at home here now, I must say though, I am behind the goalkeeping area now where they're just warming up and the pitch is massively cutting up,
[3196.52 - 3206.52] P:1568.64 E:0.065688 |  they've had a little bit of rain but it's definitely cutting up to something to keep an eye on but it looks great, I mean look at the all white kit, they've got just fantastic, what a setup it is down here at the moment.
[3206.52 - 3221.52] P:1635.36 E:0.075082 |  And John Murray, let's reiterate as well because people have been joining us all the time as they maybe get off work a little bit early and get in their cars to try to get home to watch this on BBC One and remember you can watch it on BBC One and listen to the Five Live commentary as well.
[3221.52 - 3233.52] P:1625.51 E:0.070307 |  But that is a really good German section and Raph Honeigstein said to us all Germans who are based in this country for obvious Covid reasons but that is a great German section over there.
[3233.52 - 3252.52] P:1710.06 E:0.072251 |  Yes it is actually and it looks more than the 1800 that it actually is. Our colleague Oli Foster who's outside the ground on an Olympic way has told us that they would have had an allocation of 7000 which is the case that we've seen on Mainland Europe for the games as we saw in Budapest the other night.
[3252.52 - 3269.52] P:1750.38 E:0.070643 |  But because of the restrictions etc only German fans in this country could get tickets for the match so they are there all around one corner on the far side as we look to the left of the tunnel and certainly German flags have been doing a roaring trade.
[3269.52 - 3285.52] P:1701.67 E:0.070857 |  We're going to have as big a crowd inside Wembley Stadium, inside any football stadium that we've seen since lockdown came in so there will be somewhere between 40 and 44000 people and it's making a difference.
[3285.52 - 3298.52] P:1677.31 E:0.071408 |  It really is, the atmosphere is fantastic and it's always good as part of our Five Live coverage to have the thoughts of a decent Premier League right back and we're going to do that now because Moritz Voltz has joined us.
[3298.52 - 3314.52] P:1606.98 E:0.067885 |  Also a system manager at RB Leibzig afternoon Moritz. Good afternoon guys. The Germans are going to relish this aren't they? We usually do and by the look and the sound of the atmosphere at Wembley absolutely.
[3314.52 - 3329.52] P:1820.84 E:0.066457 |  There's no reason not to. So when you look at the selection of Joachim Lov and he's got Gersens fit and healthy, Rudiger's fit and healthy, Gretzker comes in and Timo Werner comes in.
[3329.52 - 3343.52] P:1607.94 E:0.066931 |  When you look at that line up what does it say to you? First of all disappointed that he's sticking to the 343 formation and second of all pleased that we have Thomas Müller in there from the beginning
[3343.52 - 3358.52] P:1665.81 E:0.063546 |  in terms of creativity, in terms of leadership and also Gretzker as an improvement in combination with Kroos to the combination of Kroos and Gundogan because I felt we were weak at the heart of midfield.
[3358.52 - 3372.52] P:1680.83 E:0.059839 |  That Hungarian game, the sort of chaos and at times desperation in that game, was some of that down to not having the leadership of Thomas Müller?
[3372.52 - 3388.52] P:1666.40 E:0.067226 |  I don't think so. For me it is basically what this team and this group are like. Inconsistent, unable to set the switch and just focus from one moment to the next.
[3388.52 - 3405.52] P:1800.26 E:0.064277 |  And if you take all of the three group games and that's why I'm disappointed with Joachim Lov sticking to the formation because it hasn't really worked consistently throughout the group stage and I would have liked to see him change that.
[3405.52 - 3417.52] P:1765.10 E:0.063229 |  And the big discussion of course then would be a change of formation would release Kimmich into a role that he probably wants to play more rather than right wing back.
[3418.52 - 3439.52] P:1840.63 E:0.065491 |  Yes, that's the main point I'm making. For the team's sake, more than for Kimmich's sake, I would really love to see Kimmich in the centre mid to give the team shape, to give the team stability and to be allowed to lead from a central position on the field.
[3440.52 - 3457.52] P:1792.76 E:0.066041 |  Just at the time Maurice joined us and was both teams got into their warm up, they as you can hear played three Lions. But it's not obviously the most intimidating of songs and the Germans at the moment appear to be dancing and sticking to it.
[3457.52 - 3461.52] P:1765.37 E:0.080096 |  I don't know if you notice, with a lot more gusto than the English fans are doing.
[3461.52 - 3472.52] P:1663.31 E:0.072902 |  And that's not surprising because I hear the song and it just reminds me of Euro 96 and it gives me great vibes, I must say.
[3472.52 - 3477.52] P:1797.85 E:0.070738 |  It's a celebratory song for the Germans, isn't it? Because of that tournament.
[3477.52 - 3481.52] P:1886.55 E:0.061455 |  Yeah, more than any other song I can think of at the moment.
[3481.52 - 3490.52] P:1821.50 E:0.073304 |  Maurice Volswick. I've been in a number of German football grounds when we've covered European matches and the German side has won, Moritz on Norways.
[3490.52 - 3498.52] P:1629.72 E:0.070144 |  And they sing it, the German fans sing it when they've beaten the English clubs in European matches. Word perfect.
[3500.52 - 3510.52] P:1723.67 E:0.076224 |  I mean the Germans are properly singing and dancing to this at the moment. I'd say you've got one in ten of the English fans who are joining in and waving their flags at the moment.
[3510.52 - 3518.52] P:1614.57 E:0.068351 |  I guarantee you in that case it's good that we're on radio and there are no visuals with us dancing along.
[3518.52 - 3525.52] P:1720.77 E:0.068824 |  Yeah, that is very true. Karen, as you've come in your England shirt, are you singing and dancing down there?
[3525.52 - 3531.52] P:1728.42 E:0.074389 |  Yeah, I've given it massive chappers, from all the fans. I should see me. I'm loving it.
[3531.52 - 3539.52] P:1820.65 E:0.066313 |  No, it's good. I was just wondering though, I was watching the warm-up. Had I said the pitch is cutting off, that's the first time I've seen England warm-up in the middle of the pitch.
[3539.52 - 3548.52] P:1770.67 E:0.067397 |  I think there must be some issues. I know Germany weren't allowed to train on the pitch beforehand, but it is definitely cutting off, Chappers, it's something to keep an eye on for sure.
[3548.52 - 3558.52] P:1785.34 E:0.071658 |  So what, because you've been pitchside for us for two of the three in the game so far, so they're actually warming up in a different area to where they have been normally, are they?
[3558.52 - 3567.52] P:1904.22 E:0.065007 |  Yeah, definitely. And where the goalkeepers are being warming up, there's massive patches already. It looks immaculate, but if you start warming up in a certain area, it really cuts off.
[3567.52 - 3573.52] P:1709.93 E:0.061118 |  And maybe as the game progresses, it could be an issue, but they seem to be moving in different areas and could be a pitch issue.
[3573.52 - 3575.52] P:1661.26 E:0.079053 |  And we're trying to keep an eye on.
[3575.52 - 3577.52] P:1603.78 E:0.061959 |  And we're trying to keep an eye on.
[3577.52 - 3585.52] P:1549.46 E:0.066568 |  Hey look, if it gets a bubble and it goes in and Germany can see that bubble will be the best bubble in the world, I'm telling you.
[3585.52 - 3593.52] P:1642.35 E:0.068080 |  Let's not think about, you know, bad bubbles and stuff after what happened to the Spanish yesterday with Unai Seymour.
[3593.52 - 3599.52] P:1820.30 E:0.069283 |  Let's hear from Jurgen Klinsmann next on Five Live Sport. Germany, of course, one-one draw, one lost one so far.
[3599.52 - 3603.52] P:1781.09 E:0.064112 |  Jurgen was asked what kind of performance he's expecting this afternoon.
[3603.52 - 3610.52] P:1555.88 E:0.056703 |  See, this is exactly the point, is which England and which Germany we're going to see on Tuesday night.
[3610.52 - 3614.52] P:1305.09 E:0.062639 |  This young generation, they go more through emotional up and downs than maybe ever before.
[3614.52 - 3619.52] P:1330.53 E:0.052175 |  So inconsistency is part of almost their lifestyle.
[3619.52 - 3627.52] P:1262.68 E:0.055126 |  So the younger players nowadays, you know, so what side do we get? What Nagbri do we get? What team of earner do we get?
[3627.52 - 3634.52] P:1292.04 E:0.050915 |  You know, he's always at the right time at the right place, but maybe not critical enough yet, you know, to finish things off.
[3634.52 - 3637.52] P:1355.53 E:0.054683 |  So these are always the question marks with that younger generation.
[3637.52 - 3639.52] P:1354.38 E:0.061207 |  And the same is it with the English side.
[3639.52 - 3647.52] P:1449.87 E:0.052170 |  They have these highly young talented attacking minded players, but you don't know who steps it up on that specific day.
[3647.52 - 3654.52] P:1363.88 E:0.058342 |  And this drives you insane as a manager, because you put your first 11 together based on what you see in training.
[3654.52 - 3659.52] P:1380.25 E:0.057657 |  But maybe what I saw yesterday in training doesn't really reflect what I'm going to see on Tuesday night.
[3659.52 - 3667.52] P:1413.61 E:0.055287 |  So that's why for Germany it was so crucial to bring back Thomas Müller and Mats Hummels as an experienced pillar in that team,
[3667.52 - 3670.52] P:1198.82 E:0.059860 |  alongside Emmanuel Neuer and Tony Groess.
[3670.52 - 3680.52] P:1228.31 E:0.055140 |  There's all players that have about 100 caps each to kind of calm things down, to make it more consistent, to kind of go the rollercoaster up and down,
[3680.52 - 3683.52] P:1399.47 E:0.052152 |  not even in a game that happened to Germany against Hungary.
[3683.52 - 3688.52] P:1393.14 E:0.052290 |  They got emotional, they got scared of not making it, they're not passing through.
[3688.52 - 3697.52] P:1219.01 E:0.054871 |  The moment Thomas Müller came on, because he had a little bit of an injury, but he came on, not maybe to be the difference maker himself in terms of scoring a goal or so,
[3697.52 - 3706.52] P:1321.74 E:0.045052 |  he came on to calm everybody down. And that's what he did, and then they just kept on playing until Goretzka got a chance and he put them through the round of 16.
[3706.52 - 3716.52] P:1360.61 E:0.049964 |  But this is the mental and the emotional side of things for that new generation of players is so huge that pretty much it's unpredictable for us to say,
[3716.52 - 3721.52] P:1356.45 E:0.047774 |  this is going to happen in this game and this will be the outcome, impossible to predict.
[3721.52 - 3727.52] P:1927.57 E:0.069199 |  Jürgen Klinsmann, he's in the BBC studio this afternoon.
[3727.52 - 3731.52] P:1846.42 E:0.058048 |  As you can listen to his thoughts there with Gary and the team.
[3731.52 - 3738.52] P:1936.75 E:0.068341 |  Maurice Volsson, that's really interesting some of the stuff there he was saying about the emotional side of these young players.
[3738.52 - 3762.52] P:1854.05 E:0.055940 |  I think so too. And yes, it may be emotional instability compared with previous generations, but I also think the increased pace of the game has an influence on maybe less kind of stability,
[3762.52 - 3770.52] P:1875.18 E:0.051442 |  less predictable outcomes in what kind of team which face each team will show tonight.
[3770.52 - 3776.52] P:2000.66 E:0.050284 |  So the increased pace of the game in general gives you slightly less control?
[3776.52 - 3791.52] P:1933.20 E:0.052099 |  Yes, I think so. I think it just asks you to work more on instinct because you don't have time in the situation.
[3791.52 - 3799.52] P:1991.92 E:0.057449 |  And that instinct often works best from an emotional, stable place.
[3799.52 - 3807.52] P:1904.27 E:0.064696 |  But with the amount of games these days with the added stresses of social media,
[3807.52 - 3814.52] P:1896.39 E:0.061530 |  I think it just puts in different components, different challenges for players of the new generation.
[3814.52 - 3820.52] P:1875.92 E:0.067960 |  Maurice, for the time being, thank you very much. And Maurice will join us again at half-time here at Wembley just to quit one mic.
[3820.52 - 3829.52] P:1900.71 E:0.065582 |  Because that is interesting. The easiest thing is when talking about becoming more emotional or not having the same amount of control is to focus on the age of a player.
[3829.52 - 3836.52] P:1751.04 E:0.060123 |  Whereas Maurice's point about how the game has changed the pace of the game actually means you just have less control.
[3837.52 - 3844.52] P:1451.90 E:0.072019 |  It's a very good point what he was saying to be honest. There's two aspects to it, isn't there really?
[3844.52 - 3852.52] P:1618.81 E:0.068032 |  I think you mentioned social media at the end is so massive now. You have to be really mentally strong.
[3852.52 - 3859.52] P:1679.39 E:0.067182 |  And I think in terms of the tactics and the way you set up, you want to have a structure.
[3859.52 - 3865.52] P:1688.70 E:0.069987 |  You don't just want to have loads of fast individuals who just want it to be entertaining.
[3865.52 - 3879.52] P:1685.79 E:0.071040 |  You've got to have a measured approach. But I think what's so good about these young players is how resolutely they are, how switched on they are, how conditioned they are to be the best they can be.
[3879.52 - 3888.52] P:1604.58 E:0.065192 |  And this set of players, I was looking up to play with a couple of these players and they're a different breed and that's why they're playing for England at the top level.
[3889.52 - 3900.52] P:1757.18 E:0.066360 |  Speaking of players you've played with and also speaking of where players are warming up on the pitch, the England subs are just doing a little bit of with a man in the middle and trying to...
[3900.52 - 3901.52] P:1650.78 E:0.062962 |  The rondo.
[3901.52 - 3906.52] P:1833.23 E:0.069250 |  The rondo, aren't they? And Jack Greenleash is in the middle of that rondo at the moment.
[3906.52 - 3912.52] P:1794.29 E:0.072257 |  A little bit embarrassing as Micah tries to get Jack Greenleash's attention from up here in the media stands.
[3912.52 - 3916.52] P:1617.36 E:0.070520 |  Jack, could you, I'm here, please be my friend, please be my friend.
[3916.52 - 3922.52] P:1832.57 E:0.071959 |  Well, you've got three or four minutes, Micah, of trying to get his attention whilst we go to Tony Livesey and Wimbledon.
[3922.52 - 3928.52] P:1819.63 E:0.068283 |  So you don't have to focus on anything, no questions, just trying to get Jack's attention so he can see you. Tony.
[3928.52 - 3931.52] P:1868.66 E:0.067087 |  Cheers, Chappers, yes, thank you.
[3931.52 - 3938.52] P:1780.89 E:0.068739 |  Unbelievable as it is, there are seven and a half thousand people here in Centre Court, totally focused on something else other than the football there.
[3938.52 - 3944.52] P:1844.57 E:0.069163 |  Because they're watching arguably Russell Fuller, our tennis correspondent, the current greatest of all time anyway, Roger Federer.
[3944.52 - 3955.52] P:1829.96 E:0.060196 |  Making a 22nd consecutive appearance at the All England Club. Tony, at the age of 39, he's up against Adrian Manorino, who he's beaten twice in straight sets at Wimbledon before.
[3955.52 - 3963.52] P:1806.14 E:0.062531 |  Tight opening game, Federer found himself love 40 down, held on, he's since had four breakpoints on the Frenchman's serve, but Manorino has held on.
[3963.52 - 3972.52] P:1847.88 E:0.064867 |  So we're going with serve, Federer leading by four games to three. People in here enjoying it, not just because Federer's on court, but they're being protected from the rain,
[3972.52 - 3976.52] P:1776.06 E:0.059611 |  which you can hear landing quite heavily on the roof above us.
[3976.52 - 3984.52] P:1732.02 E:0.073788 |  Yes, indeed, so all the outside courts suspended at the moment, but there is play on court. Number one, there's a roof there. Naomi Cavaday's watching the German,
[3984.52 - 3987.52] P:1673.62 E:0.067564 |  Anjali Kerber in action. How's it going, Naomi?
[3987.52 - 3994.52] P:1809.89 E:0.065615 |  Yes, the champion of 2018, she's looking pretty good. Off to a bit of a slow start, lost the opening three games to Nina Stojanovic,
[3994.52 - 4001.52] P:1753.88 E:0.069208 |  who is here on her debut of Serbia, but since then she has been rolling. We've seen her firing her trademark four hand down the line,
[4001.52 - 4009.52] P:1836.02 E:0.070402 |  the cognets that the crowd knows so well. And she's coming in on good form after picking up a title in Germany the week before this tournament started.
[4009.52 - 4016.52] P:1845.09 E:0.060263 |  So the women's event is wide open, not many people talking about Kerber, but she's looking good, a set in 40 up now.
[4016.52 - 4024.52] P:1722.30 E:0.068681 |  Naomi, thank you. Russell, just looking at today what we've seen so far. One of the picks, Britain's number one, Dan Evans, getting through.
[4024.52 - 4031.52] P:1837.89 E:0.062843 |  And he looked really good as well. He was up against Feliciano Lopez, who like Roger Federer is 39, but he's a fabulous grass court player,
[4031.52 - 4037.52] P:1862.73 E:0.058080 |  and it was an awkward first round match up for him, but he won in straight sets and he was a really, really sharp performance for Evans.
[4037.52 - 4043.52] P:1927.77 E:0.058081 |  Harriet Dart, the other British player to have finished today, and she lost to the seeded Elise Mertens in straight sets.
[4043.52 - 4051.52] P:1862.31 E:0.059097 |  There are other British players hoping to come on, Francesca Jones due to play Coco Gough, Cameron Norrie and Jay Clark also in action,
[4051.52 - 4057.52] P:1782.89 E:0.056695 |  but some matches have already been called off, Emerata Karnu and Samantha Mary Shiran will not play their matches today,
[4057.52 - 4062.52] P:1747.02 E:0.062328 |  and I suspect more are going to be called off. They say in theory no play before five, but you can hear that rain coming down.
[4062.52 - 4064.52] P:1648.99 E:0.056690 |  It's going to be a much longer delay than that.
[4064.52 - 4070.52] P:1838.63 E:0.065014 |  Yeah, I've got a question on the delay in a set, but we'll just reflect on the match we saw before this one and Federer on centre court,
[4070.52 - 4075.52] P:1691.30 E:0.067670 |  where the 1-1 Ash Barty beat Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain, but there's much more to it than that.
[4075.52 - 4080.52] P:1820.53 E:0.061708 |  Such a back story for Suarez Navarro, and an emotional farewell.
[4080.52 - 4085.52] P:1794.24 E:0.068229 |  We were watching TV pictures and her mum was crying her eyes out at the end there as she left the court.
[4085.52 - 4090.52] P:1890.93 E:0.060278 |  Her mum seemed to be filming virtually every point. She said it's going to be her last year,
[4090.52 - 4098.52] P:1905.24 E:0.057586 |  and she's delighted to have the opportunity because it was only in May at the French Open that she came back after chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[4098.52 - 4102.52] P:1776.91 E:0.061476 |  I'm delighted to say she's made a complete recovery. She wants to go out on her terms,
[4102.52 - 4105.52] P:1822.91 E:0.061297 |  and unfortunately at Roland Garros, where she played her last French Open,
[4105.52 - 4111.52] P:1920.31 E:0.059056 |  she was scheduled late in the day on a show court, and by the time she played, the curfew in France had kicked in,
[4111.52 - 4117.52] P:1898.60 E:0.057392 |  so she played in front of empty stands. Here she got the perfect send-off, despite losing the match in three sets to the world number one,
[4117.52 - 4122.52] P:1864.46 E:0.057315 |  Ashleigh Barty. She got such a warm standing ovation as she left centre court for the final time.
[4122.52 - 4128.52] P:1805.35 E:0.059345 |  Indeed. Very quickly, how far behind are we if there's no play later today? Where does that leave the tournament?
[4128.52 - 4135.52] P:1805.70 E:0.059532 |  Well, it perhaps means that we could be about a day behind. They'll perhaps look to finish all the first round singles matches tomorrow,
[4135.52 - 4141.52] P:1839.10 E:0.055246 |  whereas normally they'd expect to finish them by the end of Tuesday. That's not too critical in its own if the weather forecast improves,
[4141.52 - 4144.52] P:1783.57 E:0.046612 |  which I think it's meant to from about Thursday onwards.
[4144.52 - 4149.52] P:1942.82 E:0.063914 |  Russell, thank you very much indeed. Chappers, back to you at Wembley. I'm about to break...
[4149.52 - 4154.52] P:1589.92 E:0.070971 |  We always have this problem when I'm trying to get from drive to the car park, so I can hear the Monday night club.
[4154.52 - 4160.52] P:1774.71 E:0.068955 |  I've now got 20 minutes to break the land speed record from Wimbledon back to my house, so I can watch the footy.
[4160.52 - 4164.52] P:1975.12 E:0.055287 |  Well, that's perfect. You've got 21 minutes before kick-off.
[4164.52 - 4167.52] P:1829.83 E:0.062624 |  I know, I'm going now. Goodbye. Go, go.
[4167.52 - 4173.52] P:1978.57 E:0.068342 |  Germany have just done their final warm-up routine, which involved getting the ball in the middle of their own half,
[4173.52 - 4179.52] P:1898.64 E:0.067033 |  bringing it out to one of the two wing-backs, putting the ball into the box for two players to attack it,
[4179.52 - 4185.52] P:1901.44 E:0.071417 |  and Timo Verne volleied over from six yards and in nearly way into the second tier. Did you see that, Chris?
[4185.52 - 4192.52] P:1726.83 E:0.076181 |  I haven't had to say the new Disney movie in it, Feign and Timo, but listen, at the door it's very well,
[4192.52 - 4198.52] P:1806.98 E:0.072441 |  especially Kivvige, they'll get it outweighed. He doesn't hesitate out of his feet and they get bodies in the box.
[4198.52 - 4201.52] P:1626.04 E:0.074633 |  And let's go to the cricket, Eleanor Oldroy.
[4201.52 - 4210.52] P:1793.85 E:0.069966 |  Sri Lanka, 185 all out in their innings. England 125 for four now, so they need another 61 runs from 159 balls.
[4210.52 - 4215.52] P:1730.70 E:0.069033 |  Plenty of time to get it, and ticking along pretty well with Joe Root on 41,
[4215.52 - 4220.52] P:1754.79 E:0.066287 |  Mohin Alley on 13, they put on 45 together since that little flurry of wickets in the middle of the innings
[4220.52 - 4226.52] P:1735.75 E:0.065387 |  with Morgan out for six, and Billings out for three. Looking around the crowds, everyone still seems to be in their seats.
[4226.52 - 4232.52] P:1743.07 E:0.064203 |  No major disappearance of fans going off to try and find someone to watch the game at the moment,
[4232.52 - 4238.52] P:1693.31 E:0.069139 |  but there could be a lot of radios being listened to, maybe people watching on their devices as well.
[4238.52 - 4244.52] P:1766.83 E:0.060807 |  Nobody would judge up here in the northeast. England 128 for four, they need 58 more off 158.
[4244.52 - 4249.52] P:1725.08 E:0.065654 |  Five lives, four seconds, if you want to listen to that. Both sides have gone back in,
[4249.52 - 4255.52] P:1807.61 E:0.065694 |  England's subs are still out. Jack Grealish with the calves bulging through his track two bottoms,
[4255.52 - 4263.52] P:1813.13 E:0.065434 |  just volleyed a ball 35 yards across the field to Phil Foden, who controlled it with the back of his heel,
[4263.52 - 4268.52] P:1823.27 E:0.067176 |  with his heel, kept it in the air, and then Dikipiops flicked it over his head,
[4268.52 - 4276.52] P:1791.60 E:0.062980 |  and Dikipiops for about the next 10, 12 seconds before hitting it back to Jack Grealish. You saw that, didn't you?
[4276.52 - 4282.52] P:1727.91 E:0.073525 |  It was just effortless. I mean, to have that quality on the bench as well, they need to make an impact when they come on,
[4282.52 - 4285.52] P:1718.73 E:0.069285 |  because football is so easy for those gentlemen there.
[4285.52 - 4287.52] P:1791.63 E:0.075768 |  Yeah, Kim Lover said...
[4287.52 - 4290.52] P:1790.18 E:0.064091 |  Spot the defender.
[4290.52 - 4292.52] P:1845.97 E:0.052521 |  Yeah.
[4292.52 - 4294.52] P:1958.37 E:0.077566 |  That's not hard, Mika. Come on!
[4294.52 - 4297.52] P:1792.89 E:0.068946 |  He defends himself, he's clean!
[4297.52 - 4299.52] P:1771.85 E:0.065747 |  It's not hard, that!
[4299.52 - 4303.52] P:1838.03 E:0.071649 |  That's it, and Diver's boots off now in a game, mate.
[4303.52 - 4309.52] P:1751.66 E:0.075635 |  Yeah, Kim Lover said to German television, pre-match,
[4309.52 - 4313.52] P:1784.78 E:0.073241 |  we need depth up front today, and Timo Werner offers a lot of qualities there.
[4313.52 - 4318.52] P:1834.24 E:0.067794 |  He has tremendous pace, and he can hurt defenders that way.
[4318.52 - 4322.52] P:1823.42 E:0.066801 |  Liam Goretzka, who's coming for Ilkai Gundewan this afternoon,
[4322.52 - 4326.52] P:1893.15 E:0.076510 |  Joachim Lover said Goretzka's been in great shape these last few days.
[4326.52 - 4331.52] P:1790.82 E:0.065594 |  Gundewan has had a few problems, say it was obvious that we'd make this choice.
[4331.52 - 4333.52] P:1704.90 E:0.069818 |  So that's what Joachim Lover said.
[4333.52 - 4336.52] P:1833.44 E:0.075238 |  This is what Garas Savka has said on his formation change.
[4336.52 - 4339.52] P:1492.73 E:0.062638 |  Well, we've seen the tactical problems at Germany, of course,
[4339.52 - 4342.52] P:1343.86 E:0.067188 |  some of their opponents already, and we knew we had to deal with that.
[4342.52 - 4346.52] P:1316.04 E:0.071195 |  But of course, also, we've got to cause them problems with the ball,
[4346.52 - 4350.52] P:1327.50 E:0.075826 |  so the focus of a lot of our work this week has been in possession.
[4350.52 - 4352.52] P:1216.37 E:0.069647 |  But you've still got to answer that problem,
[4352.52 - 4355.52] P:1303.13 E:0.065774 |  and we felt the best way of doing that was with wing backs.
[4355.52 - 4359.52] P:1514.99 E:0.066068 |  Could I ask you about Bukaio staying in the team and Kieran Trippier coming into it?
[4359.52 - 4363.52] P:1448.65 E:0.064715 |  What was the reason for those two and their involvement?
[4363.52 - 4367.52] P:1271.97 E:0.065165 |  Well, really, their performance is already in the tournament,
[4367.52 - 4371.52] P:1306.85 E:0.068429 |  and also in training, you know, you get a good feel for where the group are at.
[4371.52 - 4375.52] P:1232.49 E:0.071309 |  With Bukaio, we think speed today and behind the back line is important.
[4375.52 - 4379.52] P:1279.97 E:0.064360 |  He's been really comfortable receiving under pressure,
[4379.52 - 4382.52] P:1230.14 E:0.068998 |  and I think that's a key attribute for today's game.
[4382.52 - 4385.52] P:1566.34 E:0.069327 |  And Kieran has big match experience,
[4385.52 - 4388.52] P:1521.25 E:0.074009 |  and I think we saw that in the first game against Croatia.
[4388.52 - 4392.52] P:1476.15 E:0.067524 |  He also adds to our set plays with his delivery,
[4392.52 - 4396.52] P:1395.36 E:0.074208 |  and he's one of the best communicators and talkers we've got in the team.
[4396.52 - 4399.52] P:1497.23 E:0.065203 |  So he's been a key player for us for a long time.
[4399.52 - 4403.52] P:1620.19 E:0.074256 |  It's a wonderful occasion for us, but to make it a wonderful night for you,
[4403.52 - 4405.52] P:1461.28 E:0.057186 |  what do you want England to do tonight?
[4405.52 - 4409.52] P:1335.57 E:0.071239 |  Well, for it to be a wonderful night, we have to win, as in fact as that.
[4409.52 - 4413.52] P:1236.24 E:0.070472 |  So I think we've got to play with composure.
[4413.52 - 4415.52] P:1395.31 E:0.068249 |  Decision-making's got to be good.
[4415.52 - 4419.52] P:1377.91 E:0.072982 |  This isn't a game that will be won just on passion and athleticism.
[4419.52 - 4421.52] P:1490.18 E:0.066956 |  It's a game where you've got to make good decisions,
[4421.52 - 4424.52] P:1635.82 E:0.058863 |  and we've talked to the players about that.
[4424.52 - 4427.52] P:1902.26 E:0.064816 |  As sweet Caroline rins around Wembley,
[4427.52 - 4430.52] P:1848.89 E:0.078009 |  did you notice anything particular when you watched England
[4430.52 - 4433.52] P:1668.85 E:0.065409 |  during the last few bits of their warm-up?
[4433.52 - 4436.52] P:1763.80 E:0.073158 |  Not really. They look really just calm and relaxed.
[4436.52 - 4439.52] P:1673.01 E:0.070542 |  I spoke to the kitman briefly, and he was like,
[4439.52 - 4441.52] P:1797.03 E:0.074855 |  yeah, they're all chilled, they're good to go.
[4441.52 - 4443.52] P:1831.77 E:0.071657 |  It's going to be tight, we know that.
[4443.52 - 4446.52] P:1607.92 E:0.066250 |  And just listened to Southgate there as well.
[4446.52 - 4448.52] P:1687.95 E:0.071957 |  It's just going to be about pacing behind those moments,
[4448.52 - 4450.52] P:1733.70 E:0.070119 |  but so far when I was watching them close up,
[4450.52 - 4453.52] P:1878.65 E:0.066070 |  they're not treating it like another game by the looks of it.
[4453.52 - 4455.52] P:1871.70 E:0.069053 |  I don't know how they're feeling internally,
[4455.52 - 4460.52] P:1691.98 E:0.063892 |  but the atmosphere though is electric behind me and these golder fans.
[4460.52 - 4463.52] P:1746.84 E:0.064142 |  Getting close and close, you can feel it, you can hear them.
[4463.52 - 4465.52] P:1554.50 E:0.059249 |  I'd be interested to see Jordan Pickford trying to communicate
[4465.52 - 4470.52] P:1664.08 E:0.064068 |  to his backline with this crowd, but it's getting good now, Chappers.
[4470.52 - 4475.52] P:1640.13 E:0.072265 |  Well, hopefully they won't be blasting out of sweet Caroline once it's kicked off.
[4475.52 - 4478.52] P:1793.03 E:0.075861 |  I mean, you hear sweet Caroline. I know, you hear sweet Caroline.
[4478.52 - 4481.52] P:1734.17 E:0.069746 |  Every sporting event, every single stadium.
[4481.52 - 4485.52] P:1668.96 E:0.066322 |  It doesn't matter what it is, you always hear sweet Caroline.
[4485.52 - 4488.52] P:1703.04 E:0.060509 |  But it's great this afternoon, isn't it?
[4488.52 - 4490.52] P:1667.72 E:0.070024 |  It's nice as well, isn't it?
[4490.52 - 4494.52] P:1649.00 E:0.072149 |  It shows that some 16 to 35 is like old things.
[4494.52 - 4497.52] P:1652.97 E:0.073815 |  LAUGHTER
[4497.52 - 4499.52] P:1492.11 E:0.087538 |  Are you basing that on Micah's dancing?
[4499.52 - 4501.52] P:1654.54 E:0.077781 |  No, no, I'm basing it on the crowd,
[4501.52 - 4503.52] P:1672.27 E:0.071683 |  I'm looking at the crowd in front of us.
[4503.52 - 4505.52] P:1688.90 E:0.070805 |  Was that dancing, was it?
[4505.52 - 4507.52] P:1641.36 E:0.076113 |  LAUGHTER
[4507.52 - 4509.52] P:1596.97 E:0.084274 |  Well, I have to say, as one of those things,
[4509.52 - 4512.52] P:1553.39 E:0.076956 |  have you seen Neil Diamond in concert a couple of years ago?
[4512.52 - 4516.52] P:1695.66 E:0.077141 |  He was very good, and I represent the young people, don't I, John?
[4516.52 - 4519.52] P:1679.51 E:0.075439 |  So, you know, let's turn... Don't laugh, Micah.
[4519.52 - 4521.52] P:1695.55 E:0.076179 |  Let's turn it back to this game.
[4521.52 - 4523.52] P:1696.87 E:0.081810 |  Let's just do a little bit more on Bacchio Sacco,
[4523.52 - 4526.52] P:1702.98 E:0.074414 |  because the fearless side of his game
[4526.52 - 4530.52] P:1681.47 E:0.075343 |  appears to be what really attracts Garasalga to his selection.
[4530.52 - 4532.52] P:1862.59 E:0.078874 |  He knows that if Bacchio Sacco gets it,
[4532.52 - 4534.52] P:1596.44 E:0.061873 |  he will run at them.
[4534.52 - 4536.52] P:1655.92 E:0.077036 |  Exactly that. Sometimes you feel us.
[4536.52 - 4540.52] P:1682.20 E:0.071651 |  I played some of the best football of my life when I was 19,
[4540.52 - 4543.52] P:1649.39 E:0.078170 |  just because you don't worry about the outside noise.
[4543.52 - 4545.52] P:1693.73 E:0.068189 |  He knows he can go there, affect the game.
[4545.52 - 4548.52] P:1533.78 E:0.072263 |  He's probably the one with the least pressure.
[4548.52 - 4552.52] P:1580.01 E:0.072344 |  All the experienced pros, they're climbing a lot of weight on their shoulders,
[4552.52 - 4554.52] P:1526.43 E:0.079389 |  but for Sacco, he can go out there and enjoy it
[4554.52 - 4557.52] P:1588.53 E:0.069399 |  and show everyone exactly why he's beaten today.
[4557.52 - 4559.52] P:1813.26 E:0.080281 |  Yeah, he's fine. He's fearless at the minute.
[4559.52 - 4561.52] P:1753.69 E:0.073939 |  You've got time to think about what it's all about.
[4561.52 - 4563.52] P:1827.81 E:0.070240 |  He just goes out and plays his game.
[4563.52 - 4567.52] P:1863.05 E:0.072832 |  You know, I can only relate that to 1990, where Gaza
[4567.52 - 4570.52] P:1776.56 E:0.067676 |  just went out and played his game, didn't care what he was playing against.
[4570.52 - 4572.52] P:1747.82 E:0.059760 |  What we didn't even know was playing against sometimes.
[4572.52 - 4574.52] P:1768.34 E:0.079804 |  He just put his shirt on, went out, give him the ball,
[4574.52 - 4577.52] P:1664.05 E:0.070252 |  let him get on with it, and he was like that for two or three years,
[4577.52 - 4580.52] P:1855.36 E:0.078124 |  we call it, all his career, because he couldn't tell him to do anything else.
[4580.52 - 4583.52] P:1820.58 E:0.071145 |  I wonder where the fear comes from then.
[4583.52 - 4586.52] P:1778.43 E:0.070435 |  Where does the fear come from within that career?
[4586.52 - 4588.52] P:1807.91 E:0.070115 |  It's experience. You start playing, you start thinking more about it.
[4588.52 - 4591.52] P:1789.55 E:0.072536 |  You know, you think more about your position and losing the ball,
[4591.52 - 4593.52] P:1779.61 E:0.075800 |  and the coaches telling you this and that.
[4593.52 - 4595.52] P:1747.78 E:0.072341 |  You start learning more, but when you first come on the scene,
[4595.52 - 4597.52] P:1514.99 E:0.066621 |  you're just off the cuff. You're totally off the cuff.
[4597.52 - 4600.52] P:1572.82 E:0.071074 |  That's what they're like about you, but you've got to start,
[4600.52 - 4604.52] P:1537.04 E:0.071482 |  you start learning about the game, and then you take certain things out of your game,
[4604.52 - 4606.52] P:1599.81 E:0.064173 |  because the coaches tell you certain things.
[4606.52 - 4608.52] P:1582.24 E:0.073545 |  But yeah, young players sometimes go,
[4608.52 - 4610.52] P:1663.01 E:0.075830 |  that's why there's a lot of them start in tournaments.
[4610.52 - 4614.52] P:1596.66 E:0.070168 |  You know, like, I'm badly a few years ago, just ran out playing.
[4614.52 - 4616.52] P:1619.46 E:0.068643 |  Now he's thinking about the game too much for me.
[4616.52 - 4619.52] P:1655.39 E:0.070739 |  I watched him last night. He's still a danger, he's still a great player.
[4619.52 - 4621.52] P:1609.47 E:0.068484 |  I'm not saying he's not a great player,
[4621.52 - 4623.52] P:1675.60 E:0.067238 |  but he's starting to think too much about the game.
[4624.52 - 4628.52] P:1623.48 E:0.078368 |  In a game of this magnitude, and you've played in many of them, Chris,
[4628.52 - 4631.52] P:1608.12 E:0.069673 |  you play a game of this magnitude,
[4631.52 - 4634.52] P:1696.84 E:0.066176 |  do you settle into it immediately,
[4634.52 - 4637.52] P:1759.80 E:0.075934 |  or do you spend the first five or ten minutes thinking,
[4637.52 - 4642.52] P:1684.08 E:0.072233 |  oh, crikey, this is Germany in a World Cup or a Euras or whatever,
[4642.52 - 4648.52] P:1707.42 E:0.070470 |  and it's only 15, 20 minutes in that you could kind of settle down a little bit.
[4648.52 - 4651.52] P:1859.64 E:0.070842 |  Probably the second option. No, no, to be fair,
[4651.52 - 4655.52] P:1727.00 E:0.068463 |  when we played them, you know, we went to, we just went, we played our way,
[4655.52 - 4659.52] P:1819.14 E:0.074624 |  and we went to the top. We could have won it, they could have won it.
[4659.52 - 4662.52] P:1886.11 E:0.072858 |  So, no, I think you just want to get off to a good start,
[4662.52 - 4664.52] P:1869.07 E:0.074912 |  get a good first touch, get the ball moving,
[4664.52 - 4667.52] P:1813.50 E:0.075793 |  do a few positive things, you get the crow gone behind you,
[4667.52 - 4670.52] P:1736.58 E:0.072474 |  and all of a sudden you're into the game, and then you start enjoying it.
[4670.52 - 4674.52] P:1741.73 E:0.071503 |  If you have a bad start, it's not a great game to be in.
[4674.52 - 4677.52] P:1546.78 E:0.074518 |  For you, it's probably make sure you first touch towards the right.
[4677.52 - 4679.52] P:1660.99 E:0.072315 |  As soon as you've got that first touch, set you up for the rune.
[4679.52 - 4684.52] P:1713.77 E:0.074870 |  But for me, as a defender, make sure you win that first header on a first tackle,
[4684.52 - 4686.52] P:1734.64 E:0.074545 |  and that sets you up for the rest of the game.
[4686.52 - 4689.52] P:1785.60 E:0.075029 |  You think, like, you can do anything then, as long as you've been the first one.
[4689.52 - 4695.52] P:1708.66 E:0.067088 |  If you miss that first header, it's playing through your mind for 10, 15, 20 minutes,
[4695.52 - 4698.52] P:1655.15 E:0.071203 |  and it's so hard to recover from that.
[4698.52 - 4701.52] P:1647.59 E:0.076556 |  Is that a header that is a free header?
[4701.52 - 4704.52] P:1722.99 E:0.078287 |  Is that a header where you're going up against your man,
[4704.52 - 4707.52] P:1694.62 E:0.073234 |  and if they get the flick on your thinking, oh, God, this could be a long afternoon?
[4707.52 - 4709.52] P:1574.03 E:0.067502 |  It's a 50-50 header.
[4709.52 - 4712.52] P:1651.46 E:0.073151 |  When the ball comes and you're playing at centre-off or right back,
[4712.52 - 4713.52] P:1706.83 E:0.070989 |  you're expected to win it.
[4713.52 - 4716.52] P:1555.66 E:0.069598 |  If they win it, they've got the advantage on you.
[4716.52 - 4719.52] P:1603.62 E:0.074626 |  But I think, as a defender, just make sure you win the first tackle,
[4719.52 - 4721.52] P:1671.88 E:0.071777 |  and you can grow into the game.
[4721.52 - 4725.52] P:1694.43 E:0.071302 |  All the nerves after you get that first tackle go out the window.
[4725.52 - 4728.52] P:1759.56 E:0.081273 |  I thought you were going to say, with Chris, it was always,
[4728.52 - 4730.52] P:1783.49 E:0.078740 |  make sure you get your first touch right,
[4730.52 - 4733.52] P:1764.10 E:0.078107 |  and with you, it was always, make sure you get your fourth touch right
[4733.52 - 4735.52] P:1717.58 E:0.077065 |  after you've tried to bring it under control.
[4735.52 - 4739.52] P:1822.99 E:0.076813 |  That's not the first header was, winning the toss of the coin.
[4739.52 - 4741.52] P:1811.98 E:0.071923 |  LAUGHTER
[4741.52 - 4743.52] P:1494.17 E:0.069542 |  Yes, let's...
[4743.52 - 4746.52] P:1598.65 E:0.080305 |  Karen, every time you put on an international shirt,
[4746.52 - 4749.52] P:1652.54 E:0.066561 |  could you automatically enjoy it?
[4749.52 - 4752.52] P:1529.45 E:0.066432 |  No, not all the time.
[4752.52 - 4756.52] P:1472.30 E:0.064029 |  You're obviously so, so nervous, but it's just the biggest honour
[4756.52 - 4757.52] P:1729.05 E:0.079035 |  you'll ever ever have.
[4757.52 - 4758.52] P:1449.81 E:0.054971 |  It's the biggest privilege.
[4758.52 - 4761.52] P:1671.64 E:0.069666 |  I mean, God, I'd love to be out there now, you know,
[4761.52 - 4764.52] P:1587.88 E:0.059199 |  walking out in front of these magnificent crowds, getting on there.
[4764.52 - 4767.52] P:1710.62 E:0.076559 |  It is the best feeling, the biggest accomplishment
[4767.52 - 4769.52] P:1585.17 E:0.069389 |  you'll ever have in your life.
[4769.52 - 4771.52] P:1725.80 E:0.073729 |  We've got to get behind the guys today,
[4771.52 - 4774.52] P:1462.85 E:0.071662 |  and what an occasion for them, just buzzing for them.
[4774.52 - 4777.52] P:1619.28 E:0.067993 |  But, honestly, it's the greatest honour you'll ever have
[4777.52 - 4779.52] P:1814.11 E:0.065674 |  to represent your country.
[4779.52 - 4781.52] P:1848.39 E:0.078331 |  Talk about jerseys, you only borrow it.
[4781.52 - 4784.52] P:1767.48 E:0.064254 |  You might be lucky to get it once, you might be lucky to get it 50 times.
[4784.52 - 4787.52] P:1734.93 E:0.070463 |  Well, you only borrow it, and you've got to give it back.
[4787.52 - 4790.52] P:1542.62 E:0.068927 |  Every time you wear it, borrow it with pride.
[4790.52 - 4794.52] P:1685.15 E:0.068496 |  Honestly, it is unbelievable, and it's just bringing goosebumps back for me.
[4794.52 - 4798.52] P:1834.45 E:0.064482 |  I don't know about Michael as well, but what a day already.
[4799.52 - 4801.52] P:1599.54 E:0.087079 |  I'm honest, man, I can't stop smiling.
[4801.52 - 4807.52] P:1634.42 E:0.077749 |  It's the first time I've done a game live radio at Wembley.
[4807.52 - 4811.52] P:1739.35 E:0.078754 |  I've been by absolute element, and I can't wait for the game to kick off.
[4813.52 - 4817.52] P:1727.83 E:0.087282 |  I hope I really don't regret pointing this out, Karen.
[4817.52 - 4821.52] P:1860.25 E:0.079122 |  And I'm doing it because you mentioned Jordan Pickford and warming up,
[4821.52 - 4825.52] P:1884.94 E:0.072210 |  and we've barely talked about Jordan this tournament
[4825.52 - 4830.52] P:1685.03 E:0.068604 |  because he has been so comfortable and so sure.
[4830.52 - 4832.52] P:1709.33 E:0.064429 |  Do you know what it is, Chappers?
[4832.52 - 4835.52] P:1864.27 E:0.072542 |  Because I'm behind the goal, I seem shouting at everyone,
[4835.52 - 4839.52] P:1830.66 E:0.071165 |  so as long as he's shouting at everyone, keeping them away from his goal,
[4839.52 - 4843.52] P:1946.96 E:0.069327 |  if I see him go quiet, I'll buzz you in and I'll be like, OK, guys, I'm nervous.
[4843.52 - 4846.52] P:1789.74 E:0.069740 |  But when he's front footed, when he's telling everyone else what to do,
[4846.52 - 4849.52] P:1805.49 E:0.067507 |  keeping them organised, Michael will tell you the best defenders
[4849.52 - 4851.52] P:1723.70 E:0.071348 |  are the ones that organise everyone in front.
[4851.52 - 4855.52] P:1748.04 E:0.069152 |  The best goalkeepers organise everyone in front, so they never have to do the work.
[4855.52 - 4857.52] P:1971.80 E:0.071185 |  But Pickford, he's been brilliant.
[4857.52 - 4861.52] P:1925.23 E:0.066353 |  He looks confident, he looks assured, he looks fit, he looks sharp.
[4861.52 - 4866.52] P:1699.04 E:0.068489 |  Hopefully he doesn't get tested today, and he's well protected by that back three,
[4866.52 - 4869.52] P:1796.28 E:0.063285 |  back five, whatever it's going to end up as.
[4869.52 - 4876.52] P:1791.74 E:0.083543 |  Why, God, sir, have you just jinxed our goalkeeper before a match of the biggest match?
[4876.52 - 4879.52] P:1791.39 E:0.080761 |  No, I haven't, I haven't.
[4879.52 - 4883.52] P:1866.06 E:0.079874 |  But I thought it was fair to praise him when he...
[4883.52 - 4887.52] P:1828.08 E:0.081770 |  Jordan Pickford, I feel always really sorry for him,
[4887.52 - 4890.52] P:1921.28 E:0.074136 |  he only gets a single out when he drops a ricket.
[4890.52 - 4892.52] P:1872.15 E:0.083729 |  And he's been excellent this tournament.
[4892.52 - 4895.52] P:1876.61 E:0.077838 |  He's been brilliant this tournament, went called upon.
[4895.52 - 4899.52] P:2043.27 E:0.080799 |  I think the only thing they argue about is because people like John Stones and they emanate,
[4899.52 - 4903.52] P:1972.33 E:0.075780 |  they like to play from the back, and Jordan doesn't want to take any sort of risk of saying,
[4903.52 - 4905.52] P:1865.51 E:0.068236 |  I'm not playing little triangles in here,
[4905.52 - 4909.52] P:1825.56 E:0.079893 |  he can say they're arguing about when he sends it long, which he doesn't have it in quite a bit.
[4909.52 - 4912.52] P:1875.09 E:0.084171 |  That's the only thing you can say they've been arguing about,
[4912.52 - 4915.52] P:1872.58 E:0.070383 |  but his goalkeeping is actually being brilliant.
[4915.52 - 4918.52] P:1738.98 E:0.080138 |  And he should send it long sometimes today,
[4918.52 - 4921.52] P:1671.95 E:0.076750 |  if we think the Germans are vulnerable to the pace on the counter.
[4921.52 - 4923.52] P:1865.21 E:0.073353 |  Exactly, sometimes it has to go.
[4923.52 - 4927.52] P:1653.51 E:0.069788 |  I'll be showing that in booted long, don't worry, I'm too close to him.
[4927.52 - 4931.52] P:1639.79 E:0.071273 |  I'll be like, get rid, route one, there's no mess about with it.
[4931.52 - 4934.52] P:1711.68 E:0.083239 |  Right, well that could be you cursing him, as well as me cursing him,
[4934.52 - 4939.52] P:1743.91 E:0.075178 |  that Mike has shaken his head and looking very disappointed in you as well.
[4939.52 - 4943.52] P:1726.95 E:0.078997 |  Very quickly, Mike, how do England approach, say, the first 20-25 minutes here?
[4943.52 - 4946.52] P:1732.46 E:0.074322 |  Cautious, just feel the way into the game.
[4946.52 - 4949.52] P:1638.91 E:0.073091 |  Like I mentioned, do the simple things.
[4949.52 - 4952.52] P:1487.73 E:0.068816 |  We've got probably seven defensive players in there.
[4952.52 - 4955.52] P:1629.10 E:0.073921 |  Don't take too many risks too early on.
[4955.52 - 4960.52] P:1528.62 E:0.074801 |  We've seen the last games yesterday impact from the substitutes.
[4960.52 - 4964.52] P:1604.17 E:0.079067 |  So manage the game, it's all about game management,
[4964.52 - 4967.52] P:1575.77 E:0.079862 |  and take the chance when it comes.
[4967.52 - 4971.52] P:1676.50 E:0.084445 |  Do you manage the game, Karen, or do you go off like the house on fire?
[4971.52 - 4972.52] P:1602.25 E:0.048682 |  Yeah.
[4974.52 - 4977.52] P:1893.13 E:0.069176 |  I feel the way into the game, get your first few passes,
[4977.52 - 4980.52] P:1694.19 E:0.070767 |  probably like I said, feel the rhythm, and then open the game.
[4980.52 - 4982.52] P:1854.27 E:0.076235 |  You don't want to concede early, so one more.
[4982.52 - 4987.52] P:1670.68 E:0.062572 |  Feel the way into the game, get the rhythm, and then be explosive a little bit later on.
[4988.52 - 4992.52] P:1589.12 E:0.077639 |  There is a sensational atmosphere here in Wembley.
[4992.52 - 4996.52] P:1695.99 E:0.069311 |  45,000, we were told, weren't we?
[4996.52 - 5000.52] P:1877.32 E:0.076118 |  It's somewhere over 43, 44, something like that.
[5000.52 - 5002.52] P:1936.26 E:0.079686 |  Just one other thing I want to mention, Mark,
[5002.52 - 5005.52] P:1836.84 E:0.072550 |  I've just seen that through my binoculars.
[5005.52 - 5009.52] P:1782.86 E:0.078309 |  Quite a number of the German fans are holding up white placards.
[5009.52 - 5012.52] P:1693.73 E:0.078843 |  You can see them near the corner of the stadium,
[5012.52 - 5018.52] P:1735.81 E:0.074069 |  and they read LGBTQ rights, human rights from Wembley to Qatar.
[5018.52 - 5022.52] P:1676.39 E:0.069640 |  And significant in connection with that,
[5022.52 - 5024.52] P:1595.41 E:0.074464 |  the fact that Harry Kane and the FA,
[5024.52 - 5027.52] P:1639.86 E:0.072937 |  Harry Kane is going to wear a rainbow armband today,
[5027.52 - 5031.52] P:1721.57 E:0.076470 |  just like Manuel Neuer and the German players will show solidarity
[5031.52 - 5034.52] P:1718.94 E:0.074870 |  with England and take a knee before the match.
[5034.52 - 5036.52] P:1762.10 E:0.089568 |  Yeah, we're told upwards of 40,000.
[5036.52 - 5038.52] P:1780.08 E:0.079120 |  Thank you for that, John, here in Wembley.
[5038.52 - 5043.52] P:1794.40 E:0.075651 |  I have to say, looking around, it looks like more,
[5043.52 - 5045.52] P:1744.41 E:0.070367 |  and it sounds like more.
[5045.52 - 5051.52] P:1718.86 E:0.076078 |  Every man, woman, child on their feet at the moment around this stadium,
[5051.52 - 5054.52] P:1714.85 E:0.077785 |  the German fans are way to our left in that corner,
[5054.52 - 5058.52] P:1708.43 E:0.069305 |  have not stopped bouncing, have not stopped singing,
[5058.52 - 5062.52] P:1730.97 E:0.076656 |  have not stopped waving their flags for the last hour.
[5062.52 - 5064.52] P:1589.45 E:0.080864 |  England fans are on their feet.
[5064.52 - 5067.52] P:1701.65 E:0.081761 |  The officials are coming out of the tunnel now.
[5067.52 - 5074.52] P:1795.96 E:0.081507 |  England, led by Harry Kane, follow those officials in their blue tracksuit tops,
[5074.52 - 5077.52] P:1772.44 E:0.076798 |  white shorts and white socks are visible.
[5077.52 - 5081.52] P:1678.33 E:0.083431 |  And then, as Harry Kane reaches his position on the pitch next to the officials,
[5081.52 - 5084.52] P:1672.37 E:0.081060 |  Manuel Neuer and his red goalkeeping top,
[5084.52 - 5088.52] P:1484.59 E:0.083471 |  and the rainbow armband around his left bicep
[5088.52 - 5092.52] P:1653.18 E:0.078244 |  leads Germany out to a chorus of booze.
[5092.52 - 5097.52] P:1719.35 E:0.079030 |  This is Euro 2020, live on Five Live,
[5097.52 - 5102.52] P:1710.07 E:0.074359 |  the last 16 tie between England and Germany,
[5102.52 - 5106.52] P:1717.81 E:0.075729 |  with Michael Richards, Karen Kearney, Chris Waddell,
[5106.52 - 5110.52] P:1715.16 E:0.068406 |  and first of all, John Murray.
[5110.52 - 5112.52] P:1681.82 E:0.075479 |  Well, thank you, Mark.
[5112.52 - 5114.52] P:1644.77 E:0.075990 |  And I think the England captain, Harry Kane,
[5114.52 - 5117.52] P:1599.14 E:0.073738 |  must have felt immense pride coming out, leading England,
[5117.52 - 5121.52] P:1550.97 E:0.075348 |  into this match with that noise inside the stadium.
[5121.52 - 5124.52] P:1580.71 E:0.077313 |  And they did ask for the anthems to be respected,
[5124.52 - 5127.52] P:1701.07 E:0.081276 |  and clearly that's not happening, the German anthem.
[5170.52 - 5178.52] P:1628.60 E:0.097071 |  MUSIC
[5188.52 - 5192.52] P:1682.70 E:0.081884 |  Well, in all honesty, that was not just not respecting it,
[5192.52 - 5196.52] P:1726.85 E:0.082388 |  that was deeply disrespectful to the German anthem.
[5196.52 - 5198.52] P:1736.71 E:0.082759 |  This would be different.
[5200.52 - 5205.52] P:1583.79 E:0.092870 |  MUSIC
[5230.52 - 5235.52] P:1432.60 E:0.090105 |  MUSIC
[5248.52 - 5253.52] P:1837.49 E:0.079602 |  Well, in contrast to the reception that the German anthem received,
[5253.52 - 5256.52] P:1811.32 E:0.080639 |  that was absolutely magnificent, Chris Waddell.
[5256.52 - 5259.52] P:1748.55 E:0.080729 |  It was. I felt they went a bit higher on the top on the German one.
[5259.52 - 5261.52] P:1759.21 E:0.075853 |  I've got to say.
[5263.52 - 5267.52] P:1764.60 E:0.076560 |  Jürgen Lörf incidentally said just before the match,
[5267.52 - 5270.52] P:1762.05 E:0.075352 |  he said it's nice that one or two thousand German fans
[5270.52 - 5272.52] P:1740.47 E:0.074880 |  are here today.
[5272.52 - 5276.52] P:1712.92 E:0.076138 |  On the other hand, it's really awesome when 95% of the audience
[5276.52 - 5280.52] P:1719.84 E:0.079954 |  are against you and want you to lose.
[5280.52 - 5285.52] P:1763.31 E:0.076355 |  So that's another aspect to what we hope will be a great story
[5285.52 - 5290.52] P:1778.78 E:0.074320 |  to bring you whatever unfolds during the course of the next couple of hours
[5290.52 - 5293.52] P:1773.92 E:0.076573 |  here on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[5293.52 - 5298.52] P:1752.30 E:0.082187 |  The team photographs have been taken, the players have peeled away.
[5298.52 - 5301.52] P:1735.12 E:0.073740 |  It's white against black.
[5301.52 - 5305.52] P:1813.57 E:0.080373 |  England in the almost all-white kit with the red numbers,
[5305.52 - 5307.52] P:1764.02 E:0.077600 |  and the blue trim down the sides,
[5307.52 - 5311.52] P:1674.58 E:0.077319 |  and the Germans in the all-black kit with the white numbers on the back.
[5311.52 - 5317.52] P:1639.52 E:0.073739 |  The captains, Harry Kane and Manuel Neuer have exchanged their penance.
[5317.52 - 5320.52] P:1658.38 E:0.075565 |  I'll just run you through the teams in full if you've missed them.
[5320.52 - 5322.52] P:1652.86 E:0.077163 |  Jordan Pickford in goal for England,
[5322.52 - 5326.52] P:1751.40 E:0.073175 |  Walker Stones and McGuire, three central defenders in a 343,
[5326.52 - 5330.52] P:1851.00 E:0.076131 |  which has Trippiat, Phillips, Rice and Shaw across the middle,
[5330.52 - 5334.52] P:1791.01 E:0.072025 |  and then Sackert, Kane and Sterling as the front three.
[5334.52 - 5338.52] P:1813.25 E:0.077724 |  And the German side, Neuer in goal, Ginkart, Hummels and Rudiger,
[5338.52 - 5343.52] P:1840.11 E:0.073417 |  the three central defenders, Kimmich, Goretzka, Kross and Gosens,
[5343.52 - 5347.52] P:1773.44 E:0.068296 |  Havertz, Muller and Werner.
[5347.52 - 5350.52] P:1746.39 E:0.075971 |  So with Werner coming in, that means you've got three Chelsea players
[5350.52 - 5355.52] P:1580.32 E:0.074420 |  in the German lineup, got three Manchester City players in the England lineup,
[5355.52 - 5359.52] P:1530.56 E:0.069405 |  a little bit of Champions League afters, baby.
[5359.52 - 5364.52] P:1629.63 E:0.070791 |  And we are almost ready for the start of the match.
[5364.52 - 5370.52] P:1652.80 E:0.073101 |  The players are lined up two more places to be filled in the last eight,
[5370.52 - 5375.52] P:1603.79 E:0.073599 |  and one of them will be taken by either England or Germany.
[5375.52 - 5380.52] P:1651.49 E:0.077961 |  On this June summer's afternoon, I'm looking up through the roof of Wembley Stadium,
[5380.52 - 5384.52] P:1736.80 E:0.070527 |  there's a helicopter just appeared up there, the white arch,
[5384.52 - 5387.52] P:1723.75 E:0.079534 |  grey skies above, a little bit of rain in the air.
[5387.52 - 5393.52] P:1720.82 E:0.077919 |  And the players now taking eight, and there's the reaction from the crowd to back.
[5395.52 - 5399.52] P:1798.06 E:0.087479 |  German players and England players alike.
[5399.52 - 5407.52] P:1797.17 E:0.083312 |  I'm right, here we go, England against Germany, 2021 style here at Wembley Stadium.
[5407.52 - 5413.52] P:1708.57 E:0.081767 |  And the Germans get the match underway, and immediately the ball is fired away,
[5413.52 - 5417.52] P:1766.77 E:0.075354 |  downfield, away above Timo Werner, and it bounces through for Jordan Pickford
[5417.52 - 5420.52] P:1691.75 E:0.073299 |  to get his first touch of the match.
[5420.52 - 5425.52] P:1717.69 E:0.076069 |  It's transformational to have over 40,000 people inside Wembley.
[5425.52 - 5428.52] P:1637.90 E:0.074180 |  This is a different ball game.
[5428.52 - 5432.52] P:1658.98 E:0.075546 |  England in this very old ball game against the Germans.
[5432.52 - 5435.52] P:1611.21 E:0.076423 |  Harry Maguire hits a long pass, but that's beyond anyone.
[5435.52 - 5438.52] P:1652.58 E:0.072239 |  And a white shirt bounces through to Manuel Neuer at the other end,
[5438.52 - 5440.52] P:1800.04 E:0.075664 |  and a chorus of jeers and whistles.
[5440.52 - 5444.52] P:1836.04 E:0.073652 |  Manuel Neuer winning his 104th cap.
[5444.52 - 5449.52] P:1793.79 E:0.070503 |  This German side before kick-off had 635 caps between them.
[5449.52 - 5452.52] P:1652.56 E:0.073834 |  England, 367.
[5452.52 - 5455.52] P:1643.09 E:0.070321 |  The Germans with it in their right-back position,
[5455.52 - 5457.52] P:1749.45 E:0.079586 |  chipped away by Gimdeff on the halfway line,
[5457.52 - 5461.52] P:1771.90 E:0.076221 |  and then Thomas Muller is picked up for a shove in the back
[5461.52 - 5465.52] P:1842.48 E:0.071281 |  on Harry Maguire, who's sent sprawling flat on his face on the pitch.
[5465.52 - 5467.52] P:1678.03 E:0.070942 |  Free kick to England.
[5467.52 - 5470.52] P:1704.72 E:0.074461 |  It's an experience player with Thomas Muller.
[5470.52 - 5473.52] P:1725.40 E:0.079143 |  He knows what he's doing, he nudges him as the ball's on its way.
[5473.52 - 5476.52] P:1785.89 E:0.077644 |  And this is a chance for him to ask a question, put the ball in the box.
[5476.52 - 5479.52] P:1822.37 E:0.070907 |  Truly strange, John. Muller's playing late to centre-forward,
[5479.52 - 5483.52] P:1770.56 E:0.073304 |  alongside Burner, and Habitson's playing as nobody on the left-hand side.
[5483.52 - 5485.52] P:1726.98 E:0.068081 |  Kyle Walker's free.
[5485.52 - 5489.52] P:1727.31 E:0.068967 |  Free kick for England. The two wing-backs are there, Trippia and Shaw.
[5489.52 - 5492.52] P:1746.12 E:0.073279 |  England only two goals so far at the tournament,
[5492.52 - 5495.52] P:1703.81 E:0.062599 |  yet the score from a set piece.
[5495.52 - 5497.52] P:1724.67 E:0.069179 |  Shaw with the runner. It's Shaw's delivery,
[5497.52 - 5500.52] P:1754.94 E:0.072416 |  but it's headed away by Cross on the edge of the box.
[5500.52 - 5503.52] P:1752.86 E:0.067013 |  Calvin Phillips is there to steer it back into the centre-circle,
[5503.52 - 5508.52] P:1645.70 E:0.072424 |  and Kyle Walker actually, as German players arrive all round
[5508.52 - 5510.52] P:1545.06 E:0.069697 |  and just passes the ball back to Pickford.
[5510.52 - 5513.52] P:1601.49 E:0.079680 |  Long from Jordan Pickford, a little long ball for England,
[5513.52 - 5517.52] P:1717.64 E:0.074609 |  which bounces on the edge of the area, but will bounce through to Manuel Neuer,
[5517.52 - 5522.52] P:1640.25 E:0.073138 |  all in a kind of rust-collage outfit in the goal to our left.
[5523.52 - 5528.52] P:1708.83 E:0.075843 |  England fans, they are almost packed in in the stand down in front of us here.
[5528.52 - 5532.52] P:1729.46 E:0.072495 |  Arms raised, trying to urge England on to a place,
[5532.52 - 5534.52] P:1641.56 E:0.070895 |  in the quarter-finals.
[5534.52 - 5538.52] P:1592.50 E:0.076858 |  England would leave Wendley and go to Rome if they get through,
[5538.52 - 5541.52] P:1728.61 E:0.073391 |  and now it's been carried forward centrally by Goretzke.
[5541.52 - 5543.52] P:1794.58 E:0.067251 |  Paul giving out to the right-hand side.
[5543.52 - 5545.52] P:1815.15 E:0.071155 |  Kymich is onto this. First threat from the Germans.
[5545.52 - 5547.52] P:1798.31 E:0.072236 |  Kymich with a cross to the back post,
[5547.52 - 5549.52] P:1918.84 E:0.069599 |  which is put out by Kyle Walker.
[5549.52 - 5552.52] P:1844.58 E:0.075051 |  Jordan Pickford was scrambling there for a moment,
[5552.52 - 5554.52] P:1820.91 E:0.068773 |  but at the back post headed behind. Corner Germany.
[5554.52 - 5557.52] P:1738.89 E:0.075577 |  Well, there's the threat on the break, and what a ball by Kymich.
[5557.52 - 5560.52] P:1747.82 E:0.078508 |  His first touch wasn't the best. He digs across out of the far post.
[5560.52 - 5563.52] P:1819.90 E:0.073247 |  Kyle Walker spots the danger and heads it away for the corner.
[5563.52 - 5566.52] P:1836.64 E:0.066150 |  That's what Germany can do on the break.
[5566.52 - 5568.52] P:1831.37 E:0.067888 |  England, NL, Germany, NL.
[5568.52 - 5571.52] P:1888.30 E:0.067299 |  If you've just switched on, if you're just out of work and you're racing home,
[5571.52 - 5572.52] P:1833.73 E:0.064428 |  it's a German corner.
[5572.52 - 5575.52] P:1778.45 E:0.071342 |  Cross into the near post, that's headed away.
[5577.52 - 5579.52] P:1834.90 E:0.078863 |  Walker was down on his knees to get it away.
[5579.52 - 5582.52] P:1822.99 E:0.071620 |  The Germans take up possession. Here's Havertz on the left-hand side.
[5582.52 - 5586.52] P:1838.22 E:0.065668 |  Havertz drives it across, but that's again cleared away by Kyle Walker.
[5586.52 - 5589.52] P:1691.14 E:0.066812 |  Out of play, it's allowed to bounce by Havertz.
[5589.52 - 5592.52] P:1760.49 E:0.070333 |  The throw into the Germans ten yards back from the corner flag.
[5592.52 - 5594.52] P:1639.59 E:0.072711 |  England look quite nervous. Start the bar.
[5594.52 - 5596.52] P:1780.71 E:0.070943 |  They tried to press for the first couple of minutes.
[5596.52 - 5597.52] P:1823.09 E:0.076485 |  It didn't get any joy.
[5597.52 - 5600.52] P:1778.75 E:0.072152 |  Now Germany's got the possession and they're carried it.
[5600.52 - 5603.52] P:1845.68 E:0.073374 |  They look so relaxed to Germany's. England look quite tense.
[5603.52 - 5605.52] P:1818.17 E:0.076176 |  Germany have been a host nation.
[5605.52 - 5607.52] P:1654.48 E:0.072357 |  Played all three of their games in Munich.
[5607.52 - 5611.52] P:1599.15 E:0.067679 |  They win the loss on the draw, and they scrambled through
[5611.52 - 5613.52] P:1626.15 E:0.064668 |  in third place in the group.
[5613.52 - 5616.52] P:1596.00 E:0.070827 |  And England unbeaten. The two wins.
[5616.52 - 5621.52] P:1670.59 E:0.073148 |  And the draw against the Scots here on what was another vibrant occasion.
[5621.52 - 5623.52] P:1765.84 E:0.077084 |  And the Germans with the ball on the left-hand side.
[5623.52 - 5626.52] P:1798.56 E:0.071514 |  Here is Havertz, one of the Chelsea contingent to another.
[5626.52 - 5627.52] P:1832.55 E:0.065196 |  Verner inside the box.
[5627.52 - 5630.52] P:1815.68 E:0.070891 |  Declan Rice is back there in front of Verner to clear it away.
[5630.52 - 5635.52] P:1855.66 E:0.069001 |  Goretzka tries the shot, but it's straight at Pigford from 25 yards,
[5635.52 - 5637.52] P:1811.71 E:0.067636 |  and he gathers that into his chest.
[5637.52 - 5641.52] P:1745.83 E:0.064666 |  And that is all at the end behind which Karen Kearney
[5641.52 - 5644.52] P:1719.63 E:0.063942 |  is behind the advertising hoardings. Karen?
[5644.52 - 5646.52] P:1613.18 E:0.068592 |  I was a little bit nervous, but that whole passage of play
[5646.52 - 5649.52] P:1752.34 E:0.071618 |  is because basically it's either Havertz or Mulder
[5649.52 - 5651.52] P:1577.12 E:0.065617 |  coming into the little pocket space,
[5651.52 - 5655.52] P:1642.82 E:0.066435 |  and nobody at the back three is knowing where to go or press.
[5655.52 - 5657.52] P:1653.62 E:0.075474 |  So they've been really tentative and dropping off
[5657.52 - 5659.52] P:1662.39 E:0.066306 |  and giving them just too much time and respect,
[5659.52 - 5661.52] P:1723.74 E:0.067967 |  and they're gaining territory.
[5661.52 - 5663.52] P:1696.25 E:0.069478 |  Then we're not putting in a tackle and getting up to the ball.
[5663.52 - 5667.52] P:1761.13 E:0.064032 |  Jordan Pigford now is absolutely going berserk at his back line.
[5667.52 - 5670.52] P:1693.26 E:0.067825 |  Get closer and up to the ball.
[5670.52 - 5673.52] P:1748.79 E:0.073585 |  England international Karen Kearney down there on pitchside
[5673.52 - 5675.52] P:1732.39 E:0.072249 |  behind Jordan Pigford's goal. Germany breaking forward.
[5675.52 - 5678.52] P:1720.43 E:0.053774 |  It's Neil Nel Havertz in the centre-circle,
[5678.52 - 5680.52] P:1698.81 E:0.073114 |  just allowed the ball to run under his foot
[5680.52 - 5682.52] P:1733.96 E:0.067834 |  and then plays it out to the left-hand side,
[5682.52 - 5683.52] P:1850.14 E:0.085136 |  and there's no one there.
[5683.52 - 5685.52] P:1886.13 E:0.068627 |  Verner's made a run in to the penalty area.
[5685.52 - 5687.52] P:1837.11 E:0.072956 |  Goretzka is nowhere near it,
[5687.52 - 5692.52] P:1652.04 E:0.068357 |  and the ball is easily collected by England and by Trippia,
[5692.52 - 5693.52] P:1682.48 E:0.082000 |  and England will bring it away.
[5693.52 - 5696.52] P:1761.57 E:0.071940 |  Sacker gets a touch, and then he might have been shoved over,
[5696.52 - 5697.52] P:1740.97 E:0.074355 |  and the ball is played back to Pigford,
[5697.52 - 5701.52] P:1762.97 E:0.065131 |  who spreads his chest wide and chests it down,
[5701.52 - 5704.52] P:1692.45 E:0.067207 |  and then Jordan Pigford up towards Kane on the halfway line.
[5704.52 - 5707.52] P:1754.06 E:0.072928 |  Rudiger against Kane. He heads it forward for Germany.
[5707.52 - 5709.52] P:1702.77 E:0.061888 |  Muller flicks it out to the left-hand side.
[5709.52 - 5711.52] P:1639.92 E:0.065954 |  Verner is there, Kearney Trippia's with him,
[5711.52 - 5712.52] P:1690.54 E:0.072757 |  and Gossens has the back track,
[5712.52 - 5713.52] P:1795.27 E:0.076180 |  and I'm not sure he kept it in.
[5713.52 - 5715.52] P:1764.04 E:0.065867 |  Yes, he did on the slide.
[5715.52 - 5718.52] P:1731.66 E:0.071270 |  Gossens just kept it in play, so it is Nel Nel.
[5718.52 - 5722.52] P:1659.96 E:0.065035 |  England against the Germans for only the eighth time
[5722.52 - 5725.52] P:1649.04 E:0.066195 |  at either a European Championship or a World Cup,
[5725.52 - 5730.52] P:1666.11 E:0.066900 |  for only the third time here at Wembley at a major tournament.
[5730.52 - 5734.52] P:1747.82 E:0.065028 |  We've talked about Euro 96.
[5734.52 - 5740.52] P:1578.99 E:0.068461 |  We've certainly talked about 1966, and this is the third time.
[5740.52 - 5742.52] P:1564.67 E:0.066517 |  Here is Sacker.
[5742.52 - 5745.52] P:1603.20 E:0.066172 |  All of that are on the right-hand side.
[5745.52 - 5747.52] P:1672.51 E:0.069315 |  They've got to up the tempo with England.
[5747.52 - 5749.52] P:1788.77 E:0.071562 |  I'm not all for this cautious start.
[5749.52 - 5751.52] P:1724.87 E:0.075084 |  England's at the best when they're on the front full.
[5751.52 - 5753.52] P:1738.59 E:0.072903 |  I think Germany are controlling the game.
[5753.52 - 5754.52] P:1619.48 E:0.071899 |  They're growing in confidence.
[5754.52 - 5756.52] P:1615.38 E:0.068369 |  Listen, they've come here.
[5756.52 - 5758.52] P:1707.48 E:0.072832 |  For me, it's a free hit for them.
[5758.52 - 5760.52] P:1722.13 E:0.080615 |  Everybody seems to be against it.
[5760.52 - 5761.52] P:1700.78 E:0.072746 |  Nobody says they're not good enough.
[5761.52 - 5764.52] P:1846.67 E:0.077925 |  They're so relaxed on the ball, England can't get it off them.
[5764.52 - 5766.52] P:1815.49 E:0.067978 |  Rice loses possession centre-field,
[5766.52 - 5768.52] P:1745.43 E:0.066530 |  or he's dispossessed more correctly.
[5768.52 - 5770.52] P:1734.07 E:0.069485 |  Muller gives it to Kroos to his left.
[5770.52 - 5772.52] P:1726.01 E:0.062967 |  Now the ball is worked out by Goretzka,
[5772.52 - 5773.52] P:1718.16 E:0.072529 |  two towards the left-hand side.
[5773.52 - 5776.52] P:1643.23 E:0.075302 |  Goretzka's come in for Ilkai Gunduan,
[5776.52 - 5778.52] P:1808.71 E:0.070762 |  who had a head injury,
[5778.52 - 5780.52] P:1876.04 E:0.076356 |  but he is on the bench, Ilkai Gunduan,
[5780.52 - 5782.52] P:1804.18 E:0.074939 |  and the Germans are forced to give it all the way back
[5782.52 - 5784.52] P:1801.13 E:0.060669 |  to goalkeeper Neuer.
[5784.52 - 5786.52] P:1786.12 E:0.074882 |  If he didn't hear, incidentally,
[5786.52 - 5788.52] P:1817.02 E:0.075059 |  one of the two self-isolators in the England squad,
[5788.52 - 5790.52] P:1761.31 E:0.070529 |  Nason Mount, is there,
[5790.52 - 5793.52] P:1699.42 E:0.064021 |  so England do have Chelsea presence on the bench,
[5793.52 - 5795.52] P:1581.86 E:0.071738 |  but not built bench all well.
[5795.52 - 5797.52] P:1693.80 E:0.070325 |  He is one of the three players not included,
[5797.52 - 5799.52] P:1715.78 E:0.064651 |  which includes Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Chris.
[5799.52 - 5801.52] P:1782.88 E:0.070212 |  That's strange if you're chasing a goal
[5801.52 - 5803.52] P:1699.83 E:0.073334 |  and you've got to put the ball in the box a lot,
[5803.52 - 5806.52] P:1752.41 E:0.071437 |  there's nobody throwing the squad better than him.
[5806.52 - 5808.52] P:1770.99 E:0.069390 |  England with Saka,
[5808.52 - 5810.52] P:1768.34 E:0.069994 |  but Saka runs into trouble, Hummels dispossesses him.
[5810.52 - 5812.52] P:1850.95 E:0.072990 |  The ball is played through the middle,
[5812.52 - 5815.52] P:1851.15 E:0.072492 |  Verna's after it, but Pickford's quickly out of his penalty area,
[5815.52 - 5817.52] P:1862.34 E:0.071314 |  and the ball away, high downfield,
[5817.52 - 5819.52] P:1812.53 E:0.066723 |  Sterling's after it, allows it to bounce
[5819.52 - 5821.52] P:1736.60 E:0.071406 |  near the edge of the penalty area,
[5821.52 - 5823.52] P:1760.63 E:0.062530 |  but towering over him,
[5823.52 - 5826.52] P:1727.76 E:0.063934 |  Matias Gintag is able to head it forward in the Germans,
[5826.52 - 5829.52] P:1764.27 E:0.075065 |  have it again, Muller turning in the centre-circle against Stones,
[5829.52 - 5831.52] P:1931.55 E:0.074562 |  Garetska's centre-way through by Muller,
[5831.52 - 5833.52] P:1902.29 E:0.076845 |  England players trying to get back,
[5833.52 - 5835.52] P:1780.65 E:0.078122 |  Garetska does and down on the edge of the box,
[5835.52 - 5838.52] P:1801.34 E:0.069999 |  Rice with the challenge, it's in the D,
[5838.52 - 5841.52] P:1842.69 E:0.071656 |  it's a free kick, they fell into the penalty area,
[5841.52 - 5843.52] P:1728.51 E:0.072856 |  Yellow Guard, Declan Rice.
[5843.52 - 5846.52] P:1729.08 E:0.071517 |  What a great Thomas Muller start, this game, magnificent,
[5846.52 - 5848.52] P:1756.40 E:0.070589 |  his movement, he's coming off,
[5848.52 - 5850.52] P:1798.79 E:0.066405 |  is he going to score an opportunity,
[5850.52 - 5852.52] P:1744.80 E:0.071289 |  Kelli Walker's probably there,
[5852.52 - 5855.52] P:1749.26 E:0.062076 |  but that could easily be a different coloured card.
[5855.52 - 5858.52] P:1840.77 E:0.059759 |  That is the threat as well of Garetska,
[5858.52 - 5861.52] P:1810.63 E:0.070410 |  so dangerous, breaking forward the central midfielder,
[5861.52 - 5863.52] P:1759.46 E:0.065201 |  very good goal-scoring record,
[5863.52 - 5868.52] P:1741.60 E:0.059781 |  whether it's at club level with Bayern Munich,
[5868.52 - 5870.52] P:1692.73 E:0.067026 |  or whether it's with the German national team,
[5870.52 - 5872.52] P:1804.75 E:0.068915 |  Declan Rice shoulder with him,
[5872.52 - 5874.52] P:1783.84 E:0.065929 |  just took him back, had a handful of sherd,
[5874.52 - 5876.52] P:1763.11 E:0.068090 |  and a free kick in the D,
[5876.52 - 5878.52] P:1767.91 E:0.067978 |  quickly down to Karin Karni.
[5878.52 - 5880.52] P:1695.88 E:0.071697 |  Yeah, look, it was a foul from the Angler-Eisau,
[5880.52 - 5883.52] P:1720.49 E:0.079615 |  we got split apart and the pass was playing through,
[5883.52 - 5885.52] P:1572.63 E:0.077375 |  Declan Rice had no choice but to bring it down
[5885.52 - 5887.52] P:1638.21 E:0.077854 |  because Muller was in, you're right,
[5887.52 - 5889.52] P:1721.87 E:0.077187 |  Muller's been started really good,
[5889.52 - 5891.52] P:1708.27 E:0.076198 |  it's just game intelligence, just to go into little pockets,
[5891.52 - 5893.52] P:1626.61 E:0.071773 |  we're not dealing with it, we look nervous,
[5893.52 - 5895.52] P:1681.56 E:0.068185 |  we need to get controllable and start moving it,
[5895.52 - 5897.52] P:1790.87 E:0.068598 |  they're getting too much into the game
[5897.52 - 5899.52] P:1594.29 E:0.067229 |  and too much comfortable possession,
[5899.52 - 5901.52] P:1533.97 E:0.066231 |  I don't know if I like him.
[5901.52 - 5903.52] P:1790.54 E:0.072225 |  Long discussions about what the Germans are going to do
[5903.52 - 5906.52] P:1790.73 E:0.068551 |  with this free kick, it's only a couple of feet outside the box.
[5906.52 - 5908.52] P:1819.44 E:0.071347 |  It needs power, John, and to be fair,
[5908.52 - 5911.52] P:1814.57 E:0.068953 |  if it's me going on this one, I'm going to where,
[5911.52 - 5913.52] P:1757.45 E:0.068122 |  the goal would be standing on the right side of the goal,
[5913.52 - 5915.52] P:1838.13 E:0.073497 |  looking from the goalie's point of view,
[5915.52 - 5917.52] P:1859.04 E:0.075654 |  I'd go with power to hit the goalie,
[5917.52 - 5919.52] P:1762.89 E:0.062924 |  and if he spills it, you get it tappin'.
[5919.52 - 5921.52] P:1861.19 E:0.073129 |  Well, four or five of them were in discussions,
[5921.52 - 5924.52] P:1765.44 E:0.074644 |  Muller was there, crossed to the right of the ball,
[5924.52 - 5926.52] P:1703.62 E:0.074711 |  Haberts is standing behind it,
[5926.52 - 5928.52] P:1796.22 E:0.077352 |  to the left of it,
[5928.52 - 5930.52] P:1850.46 E:0.074402 |  they need a left footer on this with power,
[5930.52 - 5932.52] P:1933.19 E:0.077534 |  Ian for Jordan Pickford, right arm,
[5932.52 - 5934.52] P:1932.22 E:0.071487 |  a right side of Jordan Pickford,
[5934.52 - 5936.52] P:1858.00 E:0.082188 |  he can't, he's not going to stop me if he hit it hard enough.
[5936.52 - 5939.52] P:1906.34 E:0.078919 |  England so far, three clean sheets
[5939.52 - 5941.52] P:1861.15 E:0.076989 |  in the three matches at the tournament.
[5942.52 - 5945.52] P:1891.05 E:0.082097 |  It looks as though Cross might be going to tap it to Muller
[5945.52 - 5947.52] P:1900.80 E:0.071028 |  and then Haberts to hit it,
[5947.52 - 5949.52] P:1891.71 E:0.069738 |  that's what it looks like, that's what happens.
[5949.52 - 5951.52] P:1919.14 E:0.077418 |  Haberts hits it low and it's blocked in the box
[5951.52 - 5954.52] P:1862.01 E:0.076849 |  by the England wall, comes out to the right-hand side,
[5954.52 - 5956.52] P:1820.57 E:0.074666 |  the cross from Ginter,
[5956.52 - 5958.52] P:1852.46 E:0.073875 |  comes off the back of Sterling and bounces out for a throw.
[5958.52 - 5960.52] P:1779.65 E:0.077032 |  I can't believe he didn't hit that straight
[5960.52 - 5962.52] P:1799.51 E:0.070983 |  off from the place in a bit.
[5962.52 - 5964.52] P:1699.65 E:0.080001 |  When you're on the ball nowadays,
[5964.52 - 5966.52] P:1730.99 E:0.057896 |  the wall are there within a second.
[5966.52 - 5969.52] P:1663.72 E:0.068692 |  I can't believe he's just not went up and hit it with power.
[5969.52 - 5973.52] P:1755.94 E:0.063808 |  Throw into the Germans, ten yards back from the corner flag.
[5973.52 - 5978.52] P:1729.98 E:0.067966 |  England nail, Germany nail, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.
[5978.52 - 5982.52] P:1773.20 E:0.071090 |  We've got a choice of sport for you on this busy summer Saturday afternoon,
[5982.52 - 5984.52] P:1677.75 E:0.065731 |  because the One Day International continues with England
[5984.52 - 5987.52] P:1716.07 E:0.065462 |  closing in on victory against Sri Lanka.
[5987.52 - 5991.52] P:1735.97 E:0.068943 |  You can listen to that on 5 Live Sports Extra and BBC Sounds.
[5991.52 - 5993.52] P:1604.12 E:0.074296 |  We'll keep you up to date with the tennis as well,
[5993.52 - 5994.52] P:1550.91 E:0.071419 |  down at Wimbledon.
[5994.52 - 5996.52] P:1746.24 E:0.072713 |  But England, with a ball inside their own half,
[5996.52 - 5998.52] P:1735.89 E:0.060205 |  here is Garetska again.
[5998.52 - 6000.52] P:1746.44 E:0.078050 |  He's been much in evidence, the tall midfielder
[6000.52 - 6002.52] P:1663.05 E:0.071624 |  in these early stages.
[6002.52 - 6004.52] P:1825.72 E:0.073964 |  Kils are right-footed, ball forward,
[6004.52 - 6006.52] P:1642.82 E:0.060002 |  Shaw is there near the left corner of the box,
[6006.52 - 6008.52] P:1544.17 E:0.066496 |  cleared further away by Maguire.
[6008.52 - 6010.52] P:1836.83 E:0.075209 |  Rice, he was on a yellow card,
[6010.52 - 6012.52] P:1839.75 E:0.054589 |  booked Declan Rice.
[6012.52 - 6014.52] P:1665.43 E:0.077093 |  Got a long time to play on a yellow card,
[6014.52 - 6016.52] P:1769.73 E:0.065340 |  someone in that position, Chris Waddle.
[6016.52 - 6017.52] P:1650.84 E:0.072006 |  Yeah, it is.
[6017.52 - 6019.52] P:1704.52 E:0.073503 |  He's a ball winner, he breaks the play-up.
[6019.52 - 6021.52] P:1802.27 E:0.073808 |  But I've got to say, John,
[6021.52 - 6023.52] P:1841.20 E:0.066027 |  Germany have started this game magnificently.
[6023.52 - 6026.52] P:1786.67 E:0.071557 |  They're so relaxed, they're all comfortable in possession.
[6026.52 - 6029.52] P:1676.81 E:0.060828 |  England cannot get in the other one.
[6029.52 - 6031.52] P:1799.25 E:0.078197 |  Germany, with all of this experience as well,
[6031.52 - 6034.52] P:1673.84 E:0.067287 |  there's the Chelsea Champions League winners
[6034.52 - 6037.52] P:1710.86 E:0.066137 |  in the German side, four Bayern Munich players.
[6037.52 - 6039.52] P:1701.28 E:0.073261 |  Got Hummelstair as well at the back.
[6039.52 - 6042.52] P:1757.32 E:0.068440 |  The Borussia Dortmund with all of his experience.
[6042.52 - 6045.52] P:1797.21 E:0.069573 |  Tony Kroos of Real Madrid, another Centurion.
[6045.52 - 6048.52] P:1721.40 E:0.068959 |  And he has Neuer at the back in front of his penalty area.
[6048.52 - 6050.52] P:1776.31 E:0.065333 |  The Germans just keeping possession
[6050.52 - 6052.52] P:1734.58 E:0.073094 |  and just knocking the ball around,
[6052.52 - 6055.52] P:1824.20 E:0.073910 |  just trying to subdue the atmosphere.
[6055.52 - 6059.52] P:1810.09 E:0.073636 |  And you can hear the reaction from the 40-odd thousand England fans.
[6059.52 - 6061.52] P:1880.37 E:0.084068 |  I'll tell you what, John, when they got the National Ameson played
[6061.52 - 6063.52] P:1861.42 E:0.078227 |  in the Bundesliga, non-stop,
[6063.52 - 6066.52] P:1851.29 E:0.070994 |  I bet them players have had a word with each other and said,
[6066.52 - 6068.52] P:1864.39 E:0.064347 |  OK, let's show them.
[6068.52 - 6070.52] P:1786.00 E:0.064786 |  Let's show them.
[6070.52 - 6073.52] P:1652.25 E:0.065660 |  England, Nell, Germany, Nell.
[6073.52 - 6076.52] P:1757.16 E:0.069588 |  This is England's 300th match at Wembley, incidentally.
[6076.52 - 6079.52] P:1858.60 E:0.074946 |  Long ball played forward for Germany from Havertz,
[6079.52 - 6082.52] P:1815.64 E:0.067279 |  looking for the run of Gorsunds down the left-hand side.
[6082.52 - 6086.52] P:1735.82 E:0.070395 |  And it's through out of play behind the goal for England's ball.
[6086.52 - 6089.52] P:1687.21 E:0.066621 |  Might have just gone out for a throw in it, did.
[6089.52 - 6091.52] P:1665.85 E:0.069510 |  But Trippie is going to take.
[6091.52 - 6094.52] P:1699.60 E:0.065278 |  Yes, it's just actually left to Kyle Walker to take.
[6094.52 - 6097.52] P:1629.61 E:0.071240 |  We've got Micah Richards as part of the team as well,
[6097.52 - 6099.52] P:1768.39 E:0.072845 |  who is just down in front of us.
[6099.52 - 6101.52] P:1736.36 E:0.066140 |  Just see what happens here with this England throw.
[6101.52 - 6104.52] P:1718.74 E:0.066396 |  Next time the ball goes out of play, we'll hear from Micah.
[6104.52 - 6106.52] P:1713.05 E:0.067025 |  But Walker is going to take this.
[6106.52 - 6108.52] P:1708.56 E:0.072352 |  Here he is, a couple of big strides,
[6108.52 - 6112.52] P:1557.23 E:0.068871 |  and then the throw to Trippie, who heads it on.
[6112.52 - 6114.52] P:1524.99 E:0.071866 |  And then it's back with the Germans,
[6114.52 - 6117.52] P:1717.60 E:0.075682 |  but it's out of play on the far side, another England throw.
[6117.52 - 6120.52] P:1709.49 E:0.067010 |  So come in, Micah Richards. What do you think so far?
[6120.52 - 6122.52] P:1604.15 E:0.067577 |  Germany have been absolutely outstanding.
[6122.52 - 6124.52] P:1671.22 E:0.072256 |  Can't get anywhere near him.
[6124.52 - 6126.52] P:1703.33 E:0.062521 |  I mentioned before, again, win your first tackles.
[6126.52 - 6128.52] P:1604.96 E:0.072419 |  They've not done any of that.
[6128.52 - 6131.52] P:1740.80 E:0.071677 |  They've grown in Staccia, Germany, England and Lanter
[6131.52 - 6133.52] P:1805.43 E:0.072995 |  to get on the ball too much.
[6133.52 - 6136.52] P:1792.91 E:0.082839 |  And they just seem miles up.
[6136.52 - 6138.52] P:1784.44 E:0.075011 |  They look actually nervous.
[6138.52 - 6142.52] P:1753.43 E:0.076115 |  They need to settle down, relax, and play what they're not able to do.
[6142.52 - 6144.52] P:1786.99 E:0.066478 |  Well, this is England possession.
[6144.52 - 6147.52] P:1703.17 E:0.071902 |  And Maguire to Shaw on the left-hand side.
[6147.52 - 6149.52] P:1716.12 E:0.071690 |  Rice goes back across to John Stones.
[6149.52 - 6151.52] P:1894.95 E:0.075765 |  England 3-4-3, if you've just switched on.
[6151.52 - 6153.52] P:1856.76 E:0.075350 |  And you're trying to get home in time to see it.
[6153.52 - 6155.52] P:1727.98 E:0.073088 |  It's on BBC One.
[6155.52 - 6157.52] P:1628.18 E:0.059258 |  Ball played down the right-hand side.
[6157.52 - 6159.52] P:1859.28 E:0.075110 |  Cross comes across, Saka is there.
[6159.52 - 6161.52] P:1860.08 E:0.081552 |  Nice from Saka, takes on Rudiger, goes flying.
[6161.52 - 6165.52] P:1842.39 E:0.075998 |  And the referee, the Dutchman, Danny McKelley, says free kick England.
[6165.52 - 6167.52] P:1747.49 E:0.080448 |  A well-played Brookhae, or Saka.
[6167.52 - 6169.52] P:1735.33 E:0.076871 |  Yeah, well, a good little turn.
[6169.52 - 6171.52] P:1658.05 E:0.076089 |  Maybe could have got a free kick off Cross.
[6171.52 - 6173.52] P:1792.14 E:0.072850 |  He doesn't, he keeps going.
[6173.52 - 6175.52] P:1694.46 E:0.074626 |  And Rudiger comes in, yes, and he's blocked him off,
[6175.52 - 6177.52] P:1775.04 E:0.075128 |  he's obstruction, and it's a free kick,
[6177.52 - 6180.52] P:1695.45 E:0.075783 |  and we know good England are at set pieces.
[6180.52 - 6182.52] P:1714.97 E:0.077942 |  Yep, we knew that the world cooked
[6182.52 - 6187.52] P:1679.71 E:0.073138 |  when they scored nine of the 12 goals in Russia from set pieces.
[6187.52 - 6189.52] P:1630.64 E:0.075422 |  So a free kick on the right-hand side,
[6189.52 - 6192.52] P:1691.73 E:0.074578 |  yet to really threaten from a set piece.
[6192.52 - 6194.52] P:1523.69 E:0.072295 |  Nell Nell.
[6194.52 - 6199.52] P:1642.69 E:0.074029 |  And England with Maguire at the back post.
[6199.52 - 6203.52] P:1642.04 E:0.075247 |  And Declan Rice on the edge of the box.
[6203.52 - 6205.52] P:1700.43 E:0.074060 |  Here's the free kick played into the back post.
[6205.52 - 6207.52] P:1814.87 E:0.073382 |  Maguire does get his head to it, but it's headed away
[6207.52 - 6209.52] P:1684.41 E:0.072128 |  for Germany on the edge of their own penalty area.
[6210.52 - 6213.52] P:1816.32 E:0.075581 |  And they were able to pick out Maguire with the set piece,
[6213.52 - 6215.52] P:1758.30 E:0.071713 |  but not able to threaten.
[6215.52 - 6217.52] P:1662.36 E:0.077563 |  He's tried to head it back across the goal,
[6217.52 - 6219.52] P:1610.71 E:0.071350 |  obviously to an England player, but the Germans clear it.
[6219.52 - 6221.52] P:1687.14 E:0.071454 |  First real threat, England's had.
[6221.52 - 6223.52] P:1672.66 E:0.064912 |  First bit of passing.
[6223.52 - 6225.52] P:1888.19 E:0.081626 |  Oh, nice from Saka again.
[6225.52 - 6228.52] P:1819.41 E:0.072565 |  Does really well over on the far side.
[6228.52 - 6232.52] P:1884.91 E:0.078840 |  Drew Goulsons takes it up into German territory.
[6232.52 - 6234.52] P:1888.36 E:0.070574 |  Now Declan Rice receives it.
[6234.52 - 6237.52] P:1717.94 E:0.071364 |  Here's Shaw on the left-hand side, left wing back today,
[6237.52 - 6240.52] P:1718.73 E:0.070485 |  Shaw and then England go back into their own territory.
[6240.52 - 6242.52] P:1698.63 E:0.064895 |  Well, if there's one young man out there,
[6242.52 - 6246.52] P:1812.69 E:0.071856 |  the 19-year-old Bukajosaka, who's not showing nerves.
[6246.52 - 6248.52] P:1667.37 E:0.066644 |  No, he's not. He's very confident.
[6248.52 - 6250.52] P:1639.08 E:0.076576 |  He's had a good start with the game.
[6250.52 - 6252.52] P:1655.18 E:0.071537 |  He's the one positive for England.
[6252.52 - 6254.52] P:1830.39 E:0.074873 |  I've got to say the minute because Germany are in control.
[6254.52 - 6257.52] P:1781.00 E:0.075554 |  England's just starting to get a few passes underway now.
[6257.52 - 6260.52] P:1793.20 E:0.068149 |  They've got the possession for what? 10, 12 passes.
[6260.52 - 6262.52] P:1800.55 E:0.067787 |  They had the free kick, the Germans,
[6262.52 - 6265.52] P:1752.04 E:0.067406 |  which Havertz in the end struck into the wall.
[6265.52 - 6268.52] P:1582.95 E:0.063753 |  Goretzka's had a go from 25 yards,
[6268.52 - 6271.52] P:1781.84 E:0.076261 |  but England really got set peace.
[6271.52 - 6274.52] P:1802.06 E:0.074942 |  All they've been able to do anywhere near Manuel Neuer's goal
[6274.52 - 6275.52] P:1813.71 E:0.060546 |  over to our left.
[6275.52 - 6277.52] P:1679.38 E:0.065516 |  England nil, Germany nil.
[6277.52 - 6281.52] P:1616.24 E:0.071097 |  As I say, matches on BBC One to cross the BBC.
[6281.52 - 6284.52] P:1554.43 E:0.076085 |  You can listen to Guy Mowry and Jermaine Genus if you like there.
[6284.52 - 6287.52] P:1696.76 E:0.067820 |  Or when you get home, you can carry on listening to us.
[6287.52 - 6289.52] P:1680.32 E:0.070534 |  As England played to Saka down the right-hand side,
[6289.52 - 6292.52] P:1816.70 E:0.078250 |  but it's blocked out of play for a throw to England.
[6292.52 - 6296.52] P:1780.55 E:0.072905 |  Yeah, the five-life commentary synced up with the pictures in HD
[6296.52 - 6300.52] P:1672.29 E:0.073362 |  on the iPlayer and also via the BBC Sport website.
[6300.52 - 6302.52] P:1725.18 E:0.080111 |  And that's the case with all of the Euro 2020 matches
[6302.52 - 6304.52] P:1669.68 E:0.072997 |  that are live on the BBC.
[6304.52 - 6306.52] P:1603.20 E:0.073792 |  Right, let's see what England can do with this throw.
[6306.52 - 6308.52] P:1791.98 E:0.077990 |  Level with the edge of the German penalty area.
[6308.52 - 6310.52] P:1666.51 E:0.076547 |  Calvin Phillips comes short.
[6310.52 - 6314.52] P:1554.01 E:0.070128 |  Trippie takes it instead to Saka.
[6314.52 - 6317.52] P:1567.02 E:0.066101 |  Saka now back to Trippie and then back to Walker,
[6317.52 - 6318.52] P:1728.29 E:0.072724 |  near the halfway line.
[6318.52 - 6319.52] P:1697.08 E:0.071155 |  John Stones is calling for it.
[6319.52 - 6321.52] P:1687.78 E:0.067680 |  He gets it, raises his right arm,
[6321.52 - 6324.52] P:1690.00 E:0.072727 |  and then John Stones goes on a wonder forward with the ball.
[6324.52 - 6326.52] P:1813.39 E:0.074559 |  Declan Rice, square with him.
[6326.52 - 6329.52] P:1864.15 E:0.079444 |  Here's Raheem Sterling, steps inside, curling right for shot.
[6329.52 - 6333.52] P:1775.81 E:0.075942 |  But Neuer is able to dive to his left and punch away.
[6333.52 - 6335.52] P:1841.25 E:0.085186 |  Got both gloves to it, got a good sight on it
[6335.52 - 6337.52] P:1816.69 E:0.082175 |  and pushed it out for a corner.
[6337.52 - 6339.52] P:1881.94 E:0.081883 |  Well, that's the first thing we saw Raheem Sterling drop-steep.
[6339.52 - 6342.52] P:1871.42 E:0.076772 |  Comes, what, 30 yards on goal, gets it out of his feet
[6342.52 - 6344.52] P:1794.95 E:0.072875 |  and he bends it for that far post.
[6344.52 - 6346.52] P:1830.84 E:0.080265 |  And Neuer is a top-class keeper, gets across
[6346.52 - 6348.52] P:1808.33 E:0.076856 |  and pushes it away for the corner.
[6348.52 - 6350.52] P:1829.40 E:0.078182 |  He's getting the crow going.
[6350.52 - 6353.52] P:1785.26 E:0.073479 |  England's first attempt on goal, a save by Neuer.
[6353.52 - 6355.52] P:1658.91 E:0.075942 |  Didn't really get the whip on it that he would have wondered,
[6355.52 - 6358.52] P:1716.93 E:0.067535 |  but still Neuer had to make the save.
[6358.52 - 6361.52] P:1708.61 E:0.069118 |  Corner for England then, from the right-hand side.
[6361.52 - 6363.52] P:1792.36 E:0.076903 |  Here it is, White Shirts going everywhere.
[6363.52 - 6366.52] P:1812.15 E:0.071204 |  Maguire with the header, but it's straight at Neuer
[6366.52 - 6368.52] P:1761.44 E:0.075446 |  and he didn't get the power on that.
[6368.52 - 6370.52] P:1855.27 E:0.077172 |  They've got problems with set pieces.
[6370.52 - 6372.52] P:1840.30 E:0.066779 |  I think it's Avid who's picking them up
[6372.52 - 6373.52] P:1823.85 E:0.076206 |  and he's just letting them.
[6373.52 - 6377.52] P:1670.49 E:0.074192 |  He's basically got a free header from, what, 12 yards out.
[6377.52 - 6379.52] P:1676.75 E:0.075393 |  Nobody near him, there's a late challenge by Avid.
[6379.52 - 6381.52] P:1762.27 E:0.076994 |  I don't know who's supposed to mark Maguire,
[6381.52 - 6383.52] P:1909.64 E:0.072893 |  but they've got to check that out.
[6383.52 - 6386.52] P:1850.73 E:0.069845 |  Well, if you allow Harry Maguire,
[6386.52 - 6388.52] P:1877.26 E:0.066708 |  the amount of space that he's had for the free kick
[6388.52 - 6390.52] P:1791.76 E:0.074304 |  and for the corner.
[6390.52 - 6392.52] P:1788.85 E:0.071783 |  He's third time lucky.
[6392.52 - 6394.52] P:1802.37 E:0.074338 |  It could well be.
[6394.52 - 6398.52] P:1609.20 E:0.073244 |  And the Germans, we talk about their experience,
[6398.52 - 6402.52] P:1707.43 E:0.070796 |  but the weakness of this Germany team is
[6402.52 - 6406.52] P:1710.84 E:0.065846 |  that they have conceded goals.
[6406.52 - 6408.52] P:1818.91 E:0.079599 |  Conceded 25 goals.
[6408.52 - 6411.52] P:1780.81 E:0.073405 |  In their 16 matches this season.
[6411.52 - 6413.52] P:1778.02 E:0.073719 |  Fell behind in every match in the group,
[6413.52 - 6416.52] P:1680.31 E:0.073674 |  that difficult group on their home ground in Munich,
[6416.52 - 6420.52] P:1635.55 E:0.074444 |  as Germany win a free kick, 10 yards inside their own heart.
[6420.52 - 6423.52] P:1589.24 E:0.069470 |  And that is, you know, this is completely different
[6423.52 - 6424.52] P:1574.41 E:0.065972 |  for the Germans.
[6424.52 - 6428.52] P:1653.24 E:0.072169 |  Three matches in Munich and now here they are in London,
[6428.52 - 6433.52] P:1754.49 E:0.080036 |  taping on England very much in hostile territory,
[6433.52 - 6437.52] P:1695.49 E:0.076278 |  as Germany win a free kick for Rafele on Tony Kroeg.
[6437.52 - 6440.52] P:1744.44 E:0.075800 |  Kroeg's not going to get a lot of time on the ball,
[6440.52 - 6442.52] P:1706.68 E:0.071080 |  he's going to get around him.
[6442.52 - 6445.52] P:1695.57 E:0.068170 |  It's a free kick, but he just lets him know he's there.
[6445.52 - 6447.52] P:1728.39 E:0.073818 |  So Germany work it forward again.
[6447.52 - 6449.52] P:1705.64 E:0.063126 |  Back it goes to Rudiger.
[6449.52 - 6451.52] P:1541.46 E:0.076668 |  He's not been very well.
[6451.52 - 6453.52] P:1789.36 E:0.076678 |  Jochen Lerv told us last night that they were going to make
[6453.52 - 6455.52] P:1756.51 E:0.074646 |  a late decision on the three.
[6455.52 - 6457.52] P:1628.24 E:0.069380 |  Gundewan only on the bench, but Gorsens,
[6457.52 - 6460.52] P:1692.33 E:0.071468 |  the left wing back and Rudiger have both been ill, he said.
[6460.52 - 6462.52] P:1902.87 E:0.080613 |  He told us.
[6462.52 - 6464.52] P:1842.56 E:0.075444 |  Harry Maguire takes it away.
[6464.52 - 6467.52] P:1893.75 E:0.074785 |  But England take it on through Sterling.
[6467.52 - 6471.52] P:1824.92 E:0.070213 |  Sterling now, halfway inside the German half, uses Bukaj Osaka.
[6471.52 - 6474.52] P:1841.60 E:0.069148 |  Sakas ball takes a touch, deflected away from Harry Kane,
[6474.52 - 6476.52] P:1758.73 E:0.070167 |  who is after it on the edge of the area.
[6476.52 - 6479.52] P:1685.46 E:0.067677 |  And a promising position for England comes to nothing.
[6479.52 - 6482.52] P:1719.66 E:0.077412 |  It was, but Rafele still has to move the ball a lot quicker.
[6482.52 - 6484.52] P:1831.63 E:0.078224 |  He was looking in, looking in, looking in,
[6484.52 - 6487.52] P:1862.95 E:0.079203 |  eventually he ran out of space and ran out of time.
[6487.52 - 6490.52] P:1870.73 E:0.072504 |  And Muller's pass is way behind Werner and bounces out
[6490.52 - 6491.52] P:1774.27 E:0.072104 |  for a throw to England.
[6491.52 - 6493.52] P:1720.26 E:0.074309 |  England's come back into the game now.
[6493.52 - 6495.52] P:1768.77 E:0.072534 |  That first opening ten minutes, Germany were brilliant.
[6495.52 - 6497.52] P:1741.25 E:0.075931 |  And settled really early.
[6497.52 - 6499.52] P:1703.33 E:0.061758 |  England now has grown in confidence
[6499.52 - 6501.52] P:1747.51 E:0.074273 |  and they're passing the ball around a lot better.
[6501.52 - 6503.52] P:1926.76 E:0.067758 |  That's Chris Waddle with us on five-life,
[6503.52 - 6506.52] P:1799.90 E:0.072942 |  famously played against the Germans in the World Cup semi-final.
[6506.52 - 6508.52] P:1613.20 E:0.066052 |  A little bit of personal history, Chris,
[6508.52 - 6510.52] P:1759.84 E:0.078759 |  with the Germans for you as well.
[6510.52 - 6512.52] P:1684.28 E:0.071066 |  But almost everywhere you look round here.
[6512.52 - 6514.52] P:1752.57 E:0.070735 |  Gareth Southgate over on the far side.
[6514.52 - 6516.52] P:1771.42 E:0.064661 |  We were talking to Stuart Pierce earlier.
[6516.52 - 6519.52] P:1616.57 E:0.068116 |  There's history with the Germans wherever you look.
[6519.52 - 6522.52] P:1610.24 E:0.063154 |  England nil, Germany nil.
[6522.52 - 6524.52] P:1594.94 E:0.068631 |  Phillips playing at square to Rice.
[6524.52 - 6527.52] P:1694.93 E:0.071979 |  Rice now to the left-hand side, to Shaw.
[6527.52 - 6529.52] P:1708.63 E:0.071166 |  Sterling to close quarters.
[6529.52 - 6531.52] P:1865.45 E:0.070486 |  Harry Kane near the edge of the area.
[6531.52 - 6533.52] P:1754.55 E:0.072017 |  Shaw's pass to Sterling was a little short.
[6533.52 - 6535.52] P:1873.88 E:0.072436 |  The Germans were in quickly.
[6535.52 - 6538.52] P:1774.81 E:0.068963 |  Gareth is in quickly on Havertz on the half-way line.
[6538.52 - 6540.52] P:1740.39 E:0.068842 |  And the crowd enjoyed that.
[6540.52 - 6543.52] P:1645.25 E:0.073071 |  Calvin Phillips is, as they say, putting himself about.
[6543.52 - 6547.52] P:1775.43 E:0.071489 |  Yeah, he's not only a reputation.
[6547.52 - 6549.52] P:1787.42 E:0.077384 |  I've got to say, Gareth's got a midfield start.
[6549.52 - 6551.52] P:1795.27 E:0.068199 |  The game ever so well as well.
[6551.52 - 6553.52] P:1884.03 E:0.075607 |  Muller playing the ball over the top for Verna,
[6553.52 - 6555.52] P:1880.77 E:0.067198 |  who might have been offside.
[6555.52 - 6557.52] P:1845.33 E:0.071484 |  But in any case, Kyle Walker was able to come across
[6557.52 - 6559.52] P:1798.56 E:0.063320 |  and get there ahead of Verna.
[6559.52 - 6561.52] P:1600.44 E:0.068350 |  And that's certainly one of the contests
[6561.52 - 6563.52] P:1740.92 E:0.063943 |  we'll be looking for.
[6563.52 - 6566.52] P:1733.96 E:0.075156 |  Keemo Verna, who's been criticised, of course,
[6566.52 - 6569.52] P:1667.67 E:0.075628 |  in this country for the chances that he's missed this season.
[6569.52 - 6573.52] P:1614.31 E:0.072773 |  I think quite a shrewd move by Joachim Lerb
[6573.52 - 6576.52] P:1678.63 E:0.067477 |  to bring him in for this game.
[6576.52 - 6580.52] P:1731.57 E:0.071306 |  Keemo Verna in what is his first start
[6580.52 - 6583.52] P:1695.92 E:0.061540 |  of the tournament for the Germans.
[6583.52 - 6585.52] P:1706.02 E:0.067828 |  Like it goes to Stones.
[6585.52 - 6588.52] P:1776.55 E:0.066169 |  Stones looks to his right and finds Walker.
[6588.52 - 6592.52] P:1829.03 E:0.070517 |  Walker drills a low one forward towards the captain, Harry Kane,
[6592.52 - 6594.52] P:1797.59 E:0.074532 |  yet to get off the mark at Euro 2020.
[6594.52 - 6597.52] P:1768.14 E:0.074911 |  Oh, Trippie had come back from an offside position.
[6597.52 - 6599.52] P:1717.08 E:0.073353 |  I've got to say, John, I think that's the first time
[6599.52 - 6602.52] P:1773.90 E:0.059685 |  Harry Kane's touched the ball.
[6602.52 - 6604.52] P:1726.88 E:0.074183 |  Yeah, I think that's... It's nearly 20 minutes.
[6604.52 - 6606.52] P:1725.88 E:0.065439 |  Well, it is 20 minutes gone. 20 minutes gone.
[6606.52 - 6608.52] P:1656.22 E:0.073218 |  Where did that go? Yeah, exactly.
[6608.52 - 6612.52] P:1684.26 E:0.069092 |  So it's quite even, though, but not a lot of goal action.
[6612.52 - 6614.52] P:1707.82 E:0.069409 |  England are getting a lot more passes,
[6614.52 - 6616.52] P:1833.33 E:0.067970 |  a lot more confidence through that.
[6616.52 - 6618.52] P:1675.09 E:0.064376 |  With Germany carrying that threat.
[6618.52 - 6620.52] P:1703.23 E:0.077337 |  Let's go down to Karen Kearney again for a thought.
[6620.52 - 6623.52] P:1731.40 E:0.078299 |  You know, but England started to get a little bit of possession.
[6623.52 - 6627.52] P:1665.63 E:0.078369 |  It was quite a funny John Stones' turn to pick and told into Karmler.
[6627.52 - 6630.52] P:1644.88 E:0.076739 |  Won't say what he said, but Karm Dan and ready to Stones.
[6630.52 - 6632.52] P:1648.76 E:0.080675 |  He's been the one that's getting on the ball and being brave.
[6632.52 - 6635.52] P:1607.84 E:0.073825 |  He even started, built up from back to front for England.
[6635.52 - 6637.52] P:1535.27 E:0.069595 |  That's what I noticed anyway at this level.
[6637.52 - 6641.52] P:1737.11 E:0.075608 |  Trippie steps in on the right-hand side, wins the ball back.
[6641.52 - 6643.52] P:1886.67 E:0.073912 |  Now Declan Rice, forward to Sterling.
[6643.52 - 6647.52] P:1715.60 E:0.070752 |  Sterling in quite a tucked-in position there, quite central.
[6647.52 - 6652.52] P:1616.31 E:0.066881 |  Back to Rice, looking for Shaw to provide the win on this side,
[6652.52 - 6654.52] P:1715.61 E:0.071304 |  but the ball's gone back to the far side.
[6654.52 - 6657.52] P:1707.09 E:0.073945 |  The England right, Saka now turns away from Kroos.
[6657.52 - 6659.52] P:1749.16 E:0.075833 |  Kroos put in the challenge, obviously took the ball,
[6659.52 - 6662.52] P:1704.90 E:0.070003 |  it ran away, the crowd think that Saka was felled there,
[6662.52 - 6664.52] P:1675.57 E:0.073885 |  but I think Kroos did get a touch.
[6664.52 - 6666.52] P:1754.20 E:0.075885 |  Kroos got challenge again.
[6666.52 - 6668.52] P:1789.88 E:0.080358 |  You know, they were waiting for...
[6668.52 - 6670.52] P:1870.79 E:0.082285 |  Oh, Harry Maguire on Muller.
[6670.52 - 6672.52] P:1739.91 E:0.071497 |  They were waiting for that one big chance at the minute
[6672.52 - 6674.52] P:1801.22 E:0.079455 |  they just cancelled each other out.
[6674.52 - 6680.52] P:1860.70 E:0.077005 |  Maguire absolutely dominating Muller with that challenge.
[6680.52 - 6684.52] P:1704.76 E:0.066901 |  He had a run-up at it from ten yards and jumped into the challenge
[6684.52 - 6686.52] P:1666.43 E:0.059341 |  and beat Muller comprehensively.
[6686.52 - 6689.52] P:1633.00 E:0.075424 |  Balls out of play for a throw into England on the left.
[6689.52 - 6692.52] P:1717.52 E:0.064339 |  Short to take this.
[6692.52 - 6696.52] P:1598.61 E:0.072178 |  Raheem Sterling already is forced to save from Manuel Neuer,
[6696.52 - 6699.52] P:1743.18 E:0.075557 |  but a poor touch from Sterling from the short,
[6699.52 - 6703.52] P:1718.19 E:0.067700 |  throw from Shaw and it just bounces through for a goal kick.
[6703.52 - 6705.52] P:1665.87 E:0.078816 |  It's like a concentration a little bit there,
[6705.52 - 6708.52] P:1735.14 E:0.067420 |  so it does do it a few times in a game, we do see it.
[6708.52 - 6710.52] P:1668.37 E:0.076268 |  But it's very even now.
[6710.52 - 6712.52] P:1662.87 E:0.068377 |  England's up the tempo of it and they're passing the ball
[6712.52 - 6714.52] P:1715.60 E:0.065736 |  around a lot quicker.
[6714.52 - 6717.52] P:1754.98 E:0.075178 |  And the German are finding it hard now to get out their own half.
[6717.52 - 6719.52] P:1734.40 E:0.075954 |  Really vibrant atmosphere inside.
[6719.52 - 6721.52] P:1685.99 E:0.074747 |  I hope it's coming across to you, wherever you are,
[6721.52 - 6724.52] P:1639.88 E:0.064729 |  quite possibly you're in your car, trying to get home in time
[6724.52 - 6726.52] P:1705.78 E:0.074249 |  to see as much of this as possible.
[6726.52 - 6728.52] P:1684.60 E:0.073514 |  Rudik are stepping forward for Germany down the left-hand side,
[6728.52 - 6731.52] P:1770.93 E:0.075262 |  but in steps trippy up.
[6731.52 - 6733.52] P:1858.65 E:0.077614 |  And now Saka receives it.
[6733.52 - 6735.52] P:1772.06 E:0.070758 |  Saka with a little bit of space in front of him.
[6735.52 - 6738.52] P:1830.34 E:0.072443 |  Dwell on the ball, put, did get the pass back to Rice.
[6738.52 - 6740.52] P:1747.65 E:0.062664 |  Now through the middle to Sterling.
[6740.52 - 6742.52] P:1747.23 E:0.065308 |  Sterling turns, faces the play.
[6742.52 - 6745.52] P:1761.88 E:0.063168 |  Back to Rice though, behind him, Phillips and Rice together.
[6745.52 - 6747.52] P:1667.15 E:0.068496 |  Shaw, Sterling makes a run.
[6747.52 - 6752.52] P:1798.10 E:0.077166 |  Ball goes infield towards Saka, who is challenged by Garetska.
[6752.52 - 6755.52] P:1876.09 E:0.075650 |  And the referee says, yes, that is a free kick to England.
[6755.52 - 6757.52] P:1820.83 E:0.069558 |  Out here towards the left.
[6757.52 - 6759.52] P:1793.87 E:0.071863 |  He's a little bit unlucky wasn't he, Garetska?
[6759.52 - 6761.52] P:1710.59 E:0.068703 |  He's playing very well.
[6761.52 - 6763.52] P:1720.33 E:0.073641 |  He just gets a bit of the ball, he gets a bit of Saka,
[6763.52 - 6766.52] P:1853.19 E:0.068617 |  so the referee decided obviously it's a free kick.
[6768.52 - 6770.52] P:1778.47 E:0.083082 |  I just think the problem as well with England at the minute is,
[6770.52 - 6773.52] P:1739.41 E:0.070381 |  it's still wing-backs are not getting far enough forward.
[6773.52 - 6777.52] P:1784.44 E:0.070775 |  They're not joining in quick enough, they're not going on runs down them,
[6777.52 - 6781.52] P:1745.34 E:0.075254 |  stretching Germany, getting it high, whether he put crosses in or what,
[6781.52 - 6783.52] P:1799.19 E:0.066381 |  the plane's so deep.
[6783.52 - 6786.52] P:1725.85 E:0.076496 |  Garetska with the foul, might have got the ball,
[6786.52 - 6789.52] P:1839.90 E:0.073363 |  giving us a free kick, and this is in a good position.
[6789.52 - 6792.52] P:1742.96 E:0.076537 |  So obviously, need to keep our eyes on Harry Maguire again.
[6792.52 - 6795.52] P:1764.31 E:0.070946 |  Shaw and Trippie, it is Shaw who plays it in.
[6795.52 - 6798.52] P:1773.97 E:0.069421 |  The player's gone down at the back post, it's headed across the box.
[6798.52 - 6802.52] P:1797.78 E:0.066253 |  I think it was Harry Maguire who was blocked on the edge of the penalty area,
[6802.52 - 6805.52] P:1752.62 E:0.068639 |  but he's back on his feet and Germany play it back to Neuer,
[6805.52 - 6807.52] P:1781.57 E:0.077521 |  who cleared, he's a long way out of his goal,
[6807.52 - 6809.52] P:1820.86 E:0.075311 |  and the ball bounces forward towards Saka,
[6809.52 - 6811.52] P:1728.72 E:0.071117 |  but he couldn't get their humble step forward and cleared it away.
[6811.52 - 6813.52] P:1762.66 E:0.074418 |  England's just getting on top now.
[6813.52 - 6815.52] P:1797.11 E:0.076403 |  It's every set piece of the luck threat when they put the ball,
[6815.52 - 6818.52] P:1756.06 E:0.070776 |  especially Maguire attacking it in England above the tempo,
[6818.52 - 6821.52] P:1692.24 E:0.068245 |  and Germany now are feigning the pace a little bit too quick.
[6821.52 - 6824.52] P:1749.31 E:0.067941 |  And Maguire there ended up on the ground.
[6824.52 - 6827.52] P:1694.60 E:0.081335 |  I didn't see him, blocked him off, but it was obviously no far,
[6827.52 - 6829.52] P:1700.62 E:0.068967 |  it was just could be anything.
[6829.52 - 6832.52] P:1688.43 E:0.078411 |  It was Rudiger, Mark Chapman says in front of us,
[6832.52 - 6836.52] P:1652.37 E:0.069989 |  who put the block in on, we should have guessed that, shouldn't we?
[6836.52 - 6837.52] P:1733.87 E:0.072899 |  Yeah.
[6837.52 - 6839.52] P:1768.24 E:0.074976 |  Rudiger spotted the danger of Maguire.
[6839.52 - 6840.52] P:1705.01 E:0.067807 |  That's just the answer.
[6840.52 - 6841.52] P:1612.02 E:0.058162 |  And thought, next time...
[6841.52 - 6843.52] P:1766.03 E:0.081949 |  And that's what happened.
[6843.52 - 6847.52] P:1803.45 E:0.073726 |  Here is Maguire going on one of his forward runs into opposition territory.
[6847.52 - 6849.52] P:1787.91 E:0.066280 |  It's 0-0, five live in BBC Sounds.
[6849.52 - 6852.52] P:1729.16 E:0.061833 |  Saka out there on the far side, Trippie up,
[6852.52 - 6856.52] P:1674.49 E:0.062074 |  receives it coming back in, having started the first match
[6856.52 - 6862.52] P:1676.23 E:0.065593 |  against Croatia as the left back, now playing as the right wing back.
[6862.52 - 6866.52] P:1745.69 E:0.070015 |  He's nothing if not versatile, the Atletico Madrid man.
[6866.52 - 6869.52] P:1746.58 E:0.080847 |  Shaw wriggles away from Ginkard,
[6869.52 - 6873.52] P:1799.43 E:0.077288 |  and was just took back, and that's another free kick to England.
[6873.52 - 6877.52] P:1830.65 E:0.072139 |  And the set pieces now, the set pieces, the free kicks, the corners,
[6877.52 - 6879.52] P:1816.73 E:0.073725 |  beginning to mount up for England, need to make them count.
[6879.52 - 6882.52] P:1816.46 E:0.075274 |  Yeah, they are, and it's a definite free kick.
[6882.52 - 6884.52] P:1840.40 E:0.081899 |  And it's a yellow card as well for Ginkard.
[6884.52 - 6888.52] P:1872.59 E:0.069053 |  And that means he's out of the quarterfinal if Germany get through this.
[6888.52 - 6892.52] P:1641.75 E:0.065980 |  He definitely didn't need it in his game, never made the next game.
[6892.52 - 6896.52] P:1740.54 E:0.067609 |  Again, a chance to put it in and ask more questions.
[6896.52 - 6899.52] P:1681.36 E:0.063621 |  And Harry Maguire now walks across the penalty area,
[6899.52 - 6902.52] P:1682.61 E:0.070499 |  and he's walking towards Rudiger,
[6902.52 - 6906.52] P:1650.78 E:0.064297 |  and takes up a position at the back post.
[6906.52 - 6909.52] P:1740.29 E:0.066831 |  He's actually looking across at the assistant there,
[6909.52 - 6911.52] P:1813.88 E:0.073539 |  and just suggesting to the Dutch assistant
[6911.52 - 6915.52] P:1694.69 E:0.067526 |  that he needs to keep his eyes on what might happen from this free kick.
[6915.52 - 6919.52] P:1765.78 E:0.064919 |  And he did that very clearly within the sight of Rudiger.
[6919.52 - 6923.52] P:1727.44 E:0.058211 |  Very clever free kick for England then.
[6923.52 - 6925.52] P:1668.35 E:0.071230 |  This is in a good position.
[6925.52 - 6928.52] P:1735.04 E:0.060806 |  A couple of strides in from the left touch line.
[6928.52 - 6931.52] P:1772.21 E:0.071254 |  Trippier, possibly the in-swinger, Shaw the out-swinger.
[6931.52 - 6934.52] P:1793.63 E:0.070403 |  Maguire is the furthest man, and it's curled in from Trippier,
[6934.52 - 6936.52] P:1715.53 E:0.060179 |  but it's headed up in the air.
[6936.52 - 6939.52] P:1781.50 E:0.079975 |  And Neuer tried to keep it in, patted it away,
[6939.52 - 6942.52] P:1846.90 E:0.071311 |  and initially came off the head of Kimmich,
[6942.52 - 6944.52] P:1755.39 E:0.070671 |  and Neuer couldn't keep it in. It's a corner.
[6944.52 - 6946.52] P:1809.50 E:0.075782 |  They don't like set pieces for that.
[6946.52 - 6948.52] P:1783.49 E:0.074032 |  The Moe-England keep put it in there.
[6948.52 - 6950.52] P:1689.68 E:0.067832 |  You don't play any short, keep put it in the box.
[6950.52 - 6952.52] P:1803.87 E:0.067306 |  You can see they don't like defending them.
[6954.52 - 6958.52] P:1701.58 E:0.070303 |  Corner to England from the right-hand side.
[6958.52 - 6961.52] P:1703.81 E:0.067515 |  They don't like set pieces.
[6961.52 - 6963.52] P:1741.01 E:0.073335 |  Sounds a little bit like Corporal Jones,
[6963.52 - 6967.52] P:1739.57 E:0.062820 |  but we don't need to go anywhere near that on this day.
[6967.52 - 6969.52] P:1718.18 E:0.066288 |  England with the corner.
[6969.52 - 6971.52] P:1854.48 E:0.070627 |  Trippier takes it. Neuer post stones, tried to get there.
[6971.52 - 6973.52] P:1794.93 E:0.066125 |  Well-headed away by Hummels.
[6973.52 - 6975.52] P:1833.65 E:0.061930 |  Got up there ahead of him. Well-challenged.
[6975.52 - 6977.52] P:1882.06 E:0.063581 |  Phillips still plays it back to the right-hand side.
[6977.52 - 6979.52] P:1884.72 E:0.069205 |  Trippier is there. Trippier delivers.
[6979.52 - 6983.52] P:1807.65 E:0.073082 |  Maguire with the header, but under pressure could only head it wide.
[6984.52 - 6986.52] P:1779.63 E:0.076960 |  Well-wider the top corner.
[6986.52 - 6990.52] P:1792.11 E:0.070871 |  Gorsons, it was the left-wing back who put the challenge in on Maguire.
[6990.52 - 6993.52] P:1842.41 E:0.066472 |  Glorious chance. Again, the ball in the box.
[6993.52 - 6996.52] P:1804.29 E:0.075159 |  To be fair, there's quite a lot of say when they play the ball forward.
[6996.52 - 6998.52] P:1850.17 E:0.070411 |  It just stands up. Lovely ball.
[6998.52 - 7002.52] P:1775.75 E:0.064820 |  Maguire really just got to focus on the ball, hit the target.
[7002.52 - 7005.52] P:1632.67 E:0.058871 |  He's just got to hit the target there.
[7005.52 - 7007.52] P:1704.09 E:0.073792 |  Good period of play for England, Chris.
[7007.52 - 7009.52] P:1805.60 E:0.068507 |  That's an excellent period.
[7009.52 - 7012.52] P:1671.75 E:0.061669 |  Every time they get a sub-piece, keep putting it in there.
[7012.52 - 7015.52] P:1734.71 E:0.071626 |  Nill-nill. England-nill. Germany-nill.
[7015.52 - 7017.52] P:1787.22 E:0.076137 |  And we've played now almost half an hour.
[7017.52 - 7020.52] P:1871.70 E:0.071109 |  Shaw steps in ahead of Kinnick in the centre-circle.
[7020.52 - 7022.52] P:1797.52 E:0.073437 |  Now Rice, Stirling.
[7022.52 - 7025.52] P:1848.13 E:0.075260 |  This time Stirling's here on the left-hand side, on the left-wing.
[7025.52 - 7029.52] P:1827.08 E:0.067368 |  Kicks on Ginter, beats him, in-slides the challenge, swept infield by Shaw.
[7029.52 - 7033.52] P:1754.78 E:0.069125 |  But block near the corner of the penalty area and the Germans are able to break.
[7033.52 - 7036.52] P:1775.95 E:0.068376 |  Werner was looking for the ball from Gerebskad.
[7036.52 - 7040.52] P:1756.41 E:0.076000 |  That's when you hit him on the half-way, when he starts running.
[7040.52 - 7043.52] P:1844.97 E:0.073005 |  Drop that ball in behind Stones. You're not big walk, I don't think.
[7043.52 - 7046.52] P:1925.06 E:0.066255 |  But for some reason, Gerebskad did not play it.
[7046.52 - 7049.52] P:1863.62 E:0.070743 |  They just want to get back the possession, don't they?
[7049.52 - 7053.52] P:1835.39 E:0.068046 |  They've given the ball away and they like to have possession, Germany.
[7053.52 - 7055.52] P:1908.82 E:0.075625 |  And they've lost possession again.
[7055.52 - 7059.52] P:1882.90 E:0.070132 |  Senterfield, Haverts gave it away, not for the first time.
[7059.52 - 7061.52] P:1845.35 E:0.068811 |  England-nill, Germany-nill.
[7061.52 - 7064.52] P:1824.99 E:0.068029 |  We've got commentary live from Glasgow later,
[7064.52 - 7067.52] P:1666.73 E:0.064017 |  when Sweden and Ukraine will play.
[7067.52 - 7074.52] P:1744.64 E:0.063760 |  And the winners of this will play the winners of that in Rome at the weekend.
[7074.52 - 7076.52] P:1685.49 E:0.066855 |  Hummels with the ball at his feet.
[7076.52 - 7079.52] P:1709.56 E:0.065340 |  Hummels works it out towards the left-hand side.
[7079.52 - 7082.52] P:1707.08 E:0.067376 |  Now a ball to the edge of the box, but John Stones
[7082.52 - 7085.52] P:1853.78 E:0.073864 |  was able to move across and test that down quite comfortably.
[7085.52 - 7089.52] P:1769.63 E:0.069334 |  And then takes the ball out and gives it to Luxor here on the left-hand side.
[7089.52 - 7091.52] P:1720.42 E:0.066549 |  Back it goes to Maguire.
[7091.52 - 7093.52] P:1714.31 E:0.054625 |  It's been quite the threat,
[7093.52 - 7096.52] P:1715.94 E:0.072967 |  but England not yet able to make the breakthrough,
[7096.52 - 7099.52] P:1836.16 E:0.069798 |  and then Maguire is fouled by Kai Haverts.
[7099.52 - 7101.52] P:1707.35 E:0.071234 |  And he's not happy about that.
[7101.52 - 7103.52] P:1836.50 E:0.070113 |  Maguire gets up, throws his arms in the air.
[7103.52 - 7106.52] P:1742.89 E:0.069062 |  Because, Johnny, he should have went back to Pickford.
[7106.52 - 7108.52] P:1763.59 E:0.071063 |  Pickford didn't give him an option, he just stayed on his goal line,
[7108.52 - 7109.52] P:1695.55 E:0.065276 |  as if to say, I don't want it.
[7109.52 - 7111.52] P:1633.11 E:0.069181 |  And that's the point that I think, well, let's go down to Karen,
[7111.52 - 7113.52] P:1801.97 E:0.066719 |  because she's behind that goal. Karen.
[7113.52 - 7115.52] P:1536.85 E:0.072848 |  I think they were quite comfortable playing out there.
[7115.52 - 7117.52] P:1728.49 E:0.073315 |  They did look as stressed as the other game.
[7117.52 - 7119.52] P:1566.78 E:0.068491 |  I must say, though, from watching it from behind the goal,
[7119.52 - 7121.52] P:1678.47 E:0.065520 |  Stones has been brilliant at reading the situation.
[7121.52 - 7123.52] P:1757.68 E:0.066519 |  He can get sucked in at times,
[7123.52 - 7125.52] P:1838.62 E:0.070474 |  but he's made really good decisions in front-footed,
[7125.52 - 7127.52] P:1646.05 E:0.067849 |  and Walk has been brilliant at covering.
[7127.52 - 7128.52] P:1561.86 E:0.057327 |  But Trippler keeps shouting,
[7128.52 - 7131.52] P:1868.79 E:0.069862 |  because I'm not sure whether he needs to get higher or dropped back,
[7131.52 - 7133.52] P:1645.67 E:0.060575 |  and he's asking for some guidance on that.
[7133.52 - 7135.52] P:1566.15 E:0.059792 |  But I think we're not comfortable at the moment.
[7135.52 - 7138.52] P:1599.46 E:0.072579 |  We've definitely got them rattled, and I sense it down here.
[7139.52 - 7141.52] P:1671.14 E:0.060927 |  England 0, Germany 0.
[7141.52 - 7143.52] P:1645.56 E:0.065501 |  You do feel that around the ground.
[7143.52 - 7145.52] P:1700.55 E:0.070840 |  You can probably tell, listening,
[7145.52 - 7147.52] P:1652.02 E:0.064480 |  there is that buzz of expectation now
[7147.52 - 7150.52] P:1583.26 E:0.065801 |  that England are knocking on the door.
[7150.52 - 7155.52] P:1694.86 E:0.059336 |  There's crowd of over 40,000 German fans in the corner,
[7155.52 - 7157.52] P:1620.20 E:0.079740 |  only a few of them.
[7157.52 - 7160.52] P:1706.53 E:0.065092 |  Black, gold and red flags being waved at the moment,
[7160.52 - 7162.52] P:1593.40 E:0.076549 |  as England come forward again.
[7162.52 - 7166.52] P:1722.38 E:0.063538 |  But Sacher, this time, misplaces his pass, and the Germans have got it back.
[7167.52 - 7170.52] P:1698.72 E:0.076752 |  Guretska in between the penalty area in the centre-circle,
[7170.52 - 7171.52] P:1755.70 E:0.065681 |  takes it on.
[7171.52 - 7174.52] P:1656.08 E:0.072760 |  Guretska to the right-hand side, to Kimmich.
[7174.52 - 7177.52] P:1768.56 E:0.075265 |  Kimmich goes for that ball towards Werner,
[7177.52 - 7179.52] P:1827.34 E:0.079273 |  but Stones was up, red that easily, headed it down.
[7179.52 - 7181.52] P:1798.74 E:0.069977 |  Calvin Phillips plays the pass.
[7181.52 - 7183.52] P:1811.12 E:0.075586 |  That's a good pass as well, if Sterling can keep it in,
[7183.52 - 7185.52] P:1803.50 E:0.073652 |  which he can, the bouncing ball.
[7185.52 - 7187.52] P:1754.08 E:0.068048 |  Sterling now up against Kimmich.
[7187.52 - 7189.52] P:1796.59 E:0.070091 |  Sterling beats Kimmich on his left foot.
[7189.52 - 7190.52] P:1767.50 E:0.064630 |  Gintas there as well.
[7190.52 - 7193.52] P:1844.70 E:0.068461 |  Sterling with a cross to the back post, headed away by Cross,
[7193.52 - 7195.52] P:1765.19 E:0.066502 |  comes out to Rice on the edge of the box,
[7195.52 - 7198.52] P:1770.55 E:0.071806 |  and Rice has landed in between Short and Sterling,
[7198.52 - 7201.52] P:1689.04 E:0.066507 |  and the Germans are able to get it away.
[7201.52 - 7202.52] P:1594.58 E:0.081125 |  Yeah, the calm as well.
[7202.52 - 7204.52] P:1709.60 E:0.071886 |  They don't panic, they don't put the foot through it,
[7204.52 - 7207.52] P:1802.03 E:0.076235 |  they don't lash, they think they've got a bit of space out in play.
[7207.52 - 7210.52] P:1756.10 E:0.073589 |  Just earned a free kick there, Kimmich on the left shore.
[7210.52 - 7214.52] P:1702.18 E:0.069616 |  But Sterling, I think he'll get a lot of joy if he plays out against Gintas.
[7214.52 - 7217.52] P:1758.06 E:0.073542 |  If he plays that inside left corner, he'll get a lot of joy.
[7217.52 - 7219.52] P:1783.53 E:0.070794 |  Half an hour played, BBC Radio 5 Live.
[7219.52 - 7221.52] P:1615.81 E:0.068034 |  Watch it on BBC One when you get home.
[7221.52 - 7226.52] P:1671.85 E:0.066547 |  It is one of the sporting occasions of the year, this.
[7226.52 - 7232.52] P:1664.42 E:0.068020 |  And, incidentally, David Bideal and Frank Skinner are here.
[7232.52 - 7234.52] P:1728.95 E:0.064751 |  They're in the stadium.
[7234.52 - 7237.52] P:1630.87 E:0.072242 |  Three Lions on their chests, no doubt.
[7237.52 - 7241.52] P:1656.64 E:0.069934 |  And also in the stadium today, the seven-year-old Prince George
[7241.52 - 7244.52] P:1538.71 E:0.066097 |  is here at Wembley, son of the FA President,
[7244.52 - 7248.52] P:1580.71 E:0.063441 |  for his first England match with his parents.
[7248.52 - 7251.52] P:1566.21 E:0.067680 |  And Gary, our producer, is written in brackets.
[7251.52 - 7254.52] P:1587.60 E:0.066556 |  That's William and Kate.
[7254.52 - 7256.52] P:1752.41 E:0.071912 |  Thanks very much, Gary.
[7256.52 - 7259.52] P:1746.71 E:0.069629 |  As Germany bring it forward with Muller.
[7259.52 - 7262.52] P:1831.01 E:0.067156 |  Now Habertz, 25 yards out, Kimmich on the right-hand side.
[7262.52 - 7264.52] P:1829.93 E:0.070024 |  Left foot across from Kimmich to the back post,
[7264.52 - 7267.52] P:1776.43 E:0.068826 |  and it's gone beyond everyone.
[7267.52 - 7269.52] P:1873.37 E:0.079688 |  Gorsons was there, we've seen him do that
[7269.52 - 7271.52] P:1807.17 E:0.072301 |  effectively already at this tournament,
[7271.52 - 7273.52] P:1869.80 E:0.069569 |  but he couldn't get a touch on that.
[7273.52 - 7275.52] P:1754.24 E:0.070647 |  He's got a score. He's took his eye off the ball,
[7275.52 - 7277.52] P:1704.29 E:0.064869 |  he's got to be brave, he's got to go and attack it.
[7277.52 - 7279.52] P:1727.24 E:0.073184 |  It's a great move by Germany, we've not seen anything
[7279.52 - 7281.52] P:1672.90 E:0.060944 |  in front of ten minutes.
[7281.52 - 7284.52] P:1768.93 E:0.072234 |  It's a great ball in by Kimmich, he's got to go and attack that.
[7284.52 - 7287.52] P:1757.77 E:0.068690 |  He's probably saying he's got a little bit of an obstruction,
[7287.52 - 7290.52] P:1676.51 E:0.059087 |  a little bit of push from Trippia.
[7291.52 - 7293.52] P:1677.05 E:0.069971 |  It's through for a goal kick.
[7293.52 - 7295.52] P:1616.37 E:0.066146 |  That's bringing Micah Richards again,
[7295.52 - 7297.52] P:1732.46 E:0.069716 |  who's just down in front of us.
[7297.52 - 7299.52] P:1771.23 E:0.072226 |  In fact, let's just see first of all what England do with this.
[7299.52 - 7302.52] P:1565.67 E:0.069225 |  Pickford hits that ball from the edge of the six-yard box.
[7302.52 - 7305.52] P:1657.51 E:0.073731 |  It's headed forward by Ginter, England are claiming
[7305.52 - 7307.52] P:1852.17 E:0.061819 |  that struck the arm of Goretzka.
[7307.52 - 7309.52] P:1876.96 E:0.074989 |  Play-aloud to continue.
[7309.52 - 7311.52] P:1911.43 E:0.074675 |  Havertz into Verna with a shot, but Pickford is out to save
[7311.52 - 7314.52] P:1872.49 E:0.072679 |  from the angle and blocks it effectively.
[7314.52 - 7316.52] P:1873.25 E:0.072345 |  At this level he's got a score.
[7316.52 - 7318.52] P:1829.46 E:0.075036 |  We know Verna's not a great finisher.
[7318.52 - 7321.52] P:1823.54 E:0.069756 |  He needs three or four chances a game if he's going to score.
[7321.52 - 7324.52] P:1753.94 E:0.067369 |  Wonderful pass, he's just got to lift it over Pickford.
[7324.52 - 7327.52] P:1734.51 E:0.069298 |  He's going to ground early, if he just dinks it, it's one little Germany.
[7327.52 - 7329.52] P:1790.55 E:0.062636 |  And that was all Chelsea.
[7329.52 - 7332.52] P:1772.56 E:0.074880 |  Havertz, superb ball through the inside left position.
[7332.52 - 7334.52] P:1652.40 E:0.076128 |  Verna was in from the angle, but Pickford made the save.
[7334.52 - 7337.52] P:1713.47 E:0.067500 |  Important save, it's still 0-0.
[7337.52 - 7343.52] P:1669.83 E:0.059510 |  England coming forward now, sterling on this overcast afternoon.
[7343.52 - 7347.52] P:1656.39 E:0.066030 |  It's actually a very decent summer's afternoon for football,
[7347.52 - 7349.52] P:1796.58 E:0.073667 |  as Rice has it on the halfway line.
[7349.52 - 7351.52] P:1629.15 E:0.065183 |  Then back to Maguire.
[7351.52 - 7353.52] P:1721.64 E:0.065539 |  Maguire works a pass to Shaw,
[7353.52 - 7356.52] P:1701.01 E:0.065690 |  and then Rice will knock it back into his own half.
[7356.52 - 7359.52] P:1741.67 E:0.071081 |  Harry Maguire again, just knocks the ball ahead of himself.
[7359.52 - 7363.52] P:1739.26 E:0.065535 |  Gives it to his club colleague Luke Shaw on the left-hand side again.
[7363.52 - 7367.52] P:1694.68 E:0.068722 |  Shaw, not too many options there, has to go back to Maguire again.
[7367.52 - 7372.52] P:1713.07 E:0.060868 |  And then Maguire says, right, let's try on the right-hand side.
[7372.52 - 7375.52] P:1778.91 E:0.066036 |  So Kyle Walker back towards Stones.
[7375.52 - 7381.52] P:1766.60 E:0.066775 |  Now Calvin Phillips, and Stones to Bukaio Saka.
[7381.52 - 7384.52] P:1690.17 E:0.078275 |  Saka's been probing away, England have been probing away.
[7384.52 - 7387.52] P:1730.86 E:0.071317 |  Phillips now goes for one of his passes into the penalty area,
[7387.52 - 7389.52] P:1766.19 E:0.071598 |  looking for Kane, but Hummus was there,
[7389.52 - 7392.52] P:1629.00 E:0.071725 |  and he was able to head it away, and Germany have got it back.
[7392.52 - 7395.52] P:1606.13 E:0.064620 |  And that's a long one-down field towards Werner,
[7395.52 - 7397.52] P:1837.68 E:0.068169 |  and Werner with a touch to Muller.
[7397.52 - 7399.52] P:1746.13 E:0.065969 |  Lovely first-time touch from Muller.
[7399.52 - 7402.52] P:1685.75 E:0.063079 |  Gossens actually couldn't take it into his possession,
[7402.52 - 7406.52] P:1539.60 E:0.068268 |  but the Germans still have it, and then Garetska goes back into his own half.
[7406.52 - 7408.52] P:1733.92 E:0.074790 |  Let's bring in Maike Richards then.
[7408.52 - 7411.52] P:1773.57 E:0.080325 |  England have been a lot better now.
[7411.52 - 7414.52] P:1794.74 E:0.074912 |  I think they've still got a problem with his free-up the back.
[7414.52 - 7417.52] P:1839.48 E:0.064066 |  When Germany are dropping into them pockets,
[7417.52 - 7420.52] P:1800.32 E:0.073226 |  one of the centre-backs don't know whether to go over to stay.
[7420.52 - 7424.52] P:1759.21 E:0.069367 |  I've been really happy with Calvin Phillips the way he's engaging,
[7424.52 - 7427.52] P:1703.64 E:0.068889 |  and he's the one who's trying to help Kane out,
[7427.52 - 7430.52] P:1651.88 E:0.066671 |  and he's pressing in the second line,
[7430.52 - 7434.52] P:1789.73 E:0.068913 |  but a lot better for Mingo, much more encouraging.
[7434.52 - 7436.52] P:1882.34 E:0.068051 |  Thanks, Maike.
[7436.52 - 7438.52] P:1763.04 E:0.082592 |  That's the pass, long pass.
[7438.52 - 7440.52] P:1736.14 E:0.073086 |  It's hit to Kimmich. Kimmich now into the penalty area,
[7440.52 - 7443.52] P:1799.27 E:0.075320 |  and Maguire comes across and puts the block in on the offside.
[7443.52 - 7446.52] P:1800.31 E:0.076981 |  There's a great out-ball, Kimmich, and he's got terrific energy.
[7446.52 - 7448.52] P:1673.41 E:0.076882 |  He's a wonderful footballer,
[7448.52 - 7450.52] P:1730.18 E:0.069744 |  he just went a little bit too early,
[7450.52 - 7453.52] P:1675.48 E:0.068590 |  a yard and a half of the other side of Maguire,
[7453.52 - 7455.52] P:1718.06 E:0.059266 |  and he saw Werner in the middle,
[7455.52 - 7458.52] P:1722.67 E:0.060974 |  but we've just seen a replay of Werner's chance.
[7458.52 - 7461.52] P:1743.52 E:0.066070 |  He's trying to go low, trying to go through the keeper's legs,
[7461.52 - 7464.52] P:1729.22 E:0.067473 |  and he always has to do his lift-it, and it's one-nil.
[7464.52 - 7466.52] P:1821.13 E:0.070207 |  But England's had a good spell,
[7466.52 - 7469.52] P:1763.14 E:0.059149 |  but now Germany have come back into it.
[7469.52 - 7473.52] P:1720.32 E:0.067010 |  And the one-day international has been won by England, incidentally.
[7473.52 - 7475.52] P:1696.59 E:0.072652 |  England have won by five wickets,
[7475.52 - 7481.52] P:1663.15 E:0.071653 |  189 for five in reply to the Sri Lankan 185 all-out.
[7481.52 - 7483.52] P:1665.49 E:0.069087 |  Dual-root, 79-not-out.
[7483.52 - 7487.52] P:1639.30 E:0.067963 |  We will bring you all of the details on that at half-time,
[7487.52 - 7489.52] P:1656.36 E:0.070542 |  and that means, of course, that our Wimbledon coverage
[7489.52 - 7493.52] P:1721.40 E:0.065646 |  will resume on Five Live Sport Extra if it hasn't already.
[7493.52 - 7496.52] P:1803.79 E:0.070185 |  England-nil, Germany-nil here on BBC Radio Five Live.
[7496.52 - 7499.52] P:1706.00 E:0.061618 |  For the right to go to Rome to play Sweden-Ukraine.
[7499.52 - 7503.52] P:1638.18 E:0.068835 |  You'll hear Ian Dennis and Pat Nevin on that from 8 o'clock tonight.
[7503.52 - 7505.52] P:1684.12 E:0.064450 |  We'll try and bring you as many interviews
[7505.52 - 7509.52] P:1681.78 E:0.074733 |  after the conclusion of this match here at Wendley, whichever way it goes.
[7509.52 - 7512.52] P:1708.76 E:0.077267 |  And then they will all be on the Euros Daily podcast
[7512.52 - 7515.52] P:1709.28 E:0.071167 |  in the morning for you from BBC Sands.
[7515.52 - 7518.52] P:1734.40 E:0.070353 |  Phillips playing the ball back to Stoens.
[7518.52 - 7521.52] P:1747.50 E:0.073555 |  Stoens works it across here to the left-hand side.
[7521.52 - 7524.52] P:1784.83 E:0.072918 |  Ten minutes to go in the first half.
[7524.52 - 7526.52] P:1742.57 E:0.058735 |  Germany have come close.
[7526.52 - 7529.52] P:1756.03 E:0.068671 |  That Pickford save from Werner was important.
[7529.52 - 7531.52] P:1661.56 E:0.062915 |  At the other end, Stirling with the curling shot
[7532.52 - 7535.52] P:1689.63 E:0.061031 |  that was saved by Neuer and the Harry Maguire headers
[7535.52 - 7538.52] P:1771.37 E:0.061653 |  that have caused one or two problems.
[7538.52 - 7540.52] P:1630.29 E:0.073609 |  But it is still nil-nil.
[7540.52 - 7544.52] P:1758.28 E:0.069695 |  All England's matches so far have been tight affairs.
[7544.52 - 7546.52] P:1804.16 E:0.074124 |  Here's Maguire now.
[7546.52 - 7548.52] P:1577.21 E:0.069402 |  Maguire to the halfway line, but overran it,
[7548.52 - 7550.52] P:1667.05 E:0.065035 |  and then it came off.
[7550.52 - 7552.52] P:1753.34 E:0.075308 |  Havards, he was a little fortunate there.
[7552.52 - 7555.52] P:1730.23 E:0.067665 |  The touch was heavy, and it's out for a throw into England.
[7555.52 - 7558.52] P:1667.23 E:0.061291 |  Ten yards inside the German half.
[7558.52 - 7560.52] P:1602.76 E:0.071133 |  People on their feet.
[7560.52 - 7563.52] P:1527.59 E:0.071512 |  I don't think anyone is on their seat in the lower section
[7563.52 - 7565.52] P:1716.31 E:0.060686 |  of the stand in front of us.
[7565.52 - 7567.52] P:1722.62 E:0.058329 |  Throw in that Shaw is going to take.
[7567.52 - 7569.52] P:1624.14 E:0.063398 |  Apart from Mark Chapman and Michael Richards,
[7569.52 - 7571.52] P:1617.00 E:0.073710 |  as Mark helpfully points out,
[7571.52 - 7575.52] P:1736.79 E:0.061231 |  Shaw takes the throw into Saka, near the edge of the area.
[7575.52 - 7578.52] P:1646.17 E:0.070876 |  Stirling, Harry Kane, who's not been able to get into it.
[7578.52 - 7581.52] P:1747.62 E:0.074536 |  Gives it square to Declan Rice, one or two West Ham fans in the crowd.
[7581.52 - 7584.52] P:1717.65 E:0.064609 |  Wondered him to have a goal there, but he goes out to Trippia.
[7584.52 - 7586.52] P:1880.31 E:0.066122 |  Now back to Walker, puts his foot on the ball,
[7586.52 - 7589.52] P:1840.19 E:0.077924 |  puts his foot on the ball again, could have delivered it.
[7589.52 - 7591.52] P:1805.85 E:0.068854 |  He has Rice, though.
[7591.52 - 7594.52] P:1766.30 E:0.067249 |  Rice driving towards the dead ball line, then the challenge has come in,
[7594.52 - 7596.52] P:1761.14 E:0.077133 |  and Germany clear.
[7596.52 - 7599.52] P:1814.96 E:0.065804 |  He has Calvin Phillips, then it's lifted forward
[7599.52 - 7601.52] P:1809.60 E:0.071483 |  for Saka on the right-hand side.
[7601.52 - 7604.52] P:1762.16 E:0.059185 |  He's up against Rudiger in the German left-back position.
[7604.52 - 7607.52] P:1834.10 E:0.070344 |  It's actually quite congested in there, but that's a lovely ball.
[7607.52 - 7610.52] P:1850.51 E:0.069354 |  Phillips was closed down just as he tried to pull it back by Hummels,
[7610.52 - 7613.52] P:1824.65 E:0.078070 |  and the ball bounces away out of play for England.
[7613.52 - 7615.52] P:1812.34 E:0.075674 |  They want to see the ball going in the box, don't they, Colour?
[7615.52 - 7617.52] P:1757.78 E:0.068862 |  It doesn't put it in. Saka doesn't put it in.
[7617.52 - 7619.52] P:1834.22 E:0.065281 |  They get very frustrated throwing taken quickly.
[7619.52 - 7621.52] P:1847.73 E:0.060947 |  Phillips angles it back.
[7621.52 - 7624.52] P:1814.50 E:0.069953 |  It was the right idea from Calvin Phillips, but Saka wasn't onto it,
[7624.52 - 7627.52] P:1842.20 E:0.064954 |  and now Germany will break downfield with Havertz.
[7627.52 - 7629.52] P:1830.38 E:0.069558 |  Havertz has carried it 10 yards into the England half.
[7629.52 - 7633.52] P:1772.33 E:0.066675 |  Rice went with him, so Havertz in his green boots out there on the far side.
[7633.52 - 7637.52] P:1866.47 E:0.072901 |  In comes Phillips, and up ends Kai Havertz,
[7637.52 - 7640.52] P:1806.25 E:0.073980 |  with the ball probably bouncing out of play anyway,
[7640.52 - 7644.52] P:1753.84 E:0.062158 |  but Havertz is just having a claim to his feet.
[7644.52 - 7646.52] P:1619.61 E:0.067474 |  He runs him up the field, doesn't he?
[7646.52 - 7649.52] P:1672.15 E:0.076760 |  He gets to do it away from the trouble of their own goal,
[7649.52 - 7651.52] P:1781.75 E:0.056485 |  and Phillips doesn't hang back on the chance.
[7651.52 - 7653.52] P:1776.98 E:0.071689 |  He could have put Werner in actually once or twice there.
[7653.52 - 7655.52] P:1693.94 E:0.065459 |  Werner held his grunt, he could have put him in,
[7655.52 - 7658.52] P:1726.24 E:0.065020 |  but he could say to keep hold of the ball, and they get it thrown in.
[7658.52 - 7661.52] P:1639.60 E:0.068401 |  But Germany are very good at changing the tempo of the game.
[7661.52 - 7664.52] P:1852.66 E:0.078140 |  They play slow, they play slow, and all of a sudden they go through the gears.
[7664.52 - 7666.52] P:1824.28 E:0.065970 |  Jürgen Lürth wasn't best pleased with that.
[7666.52 - 7669.52] P:1720.19 E:0.065132 |  He's got an open necked baggy blue shirt,
[7669.52 - 7671.52] P:1719.34 E:0.064139 |  and he's got a nice white shirt.
[7671.52 - 7673.52] P:1787.28 E:0.064724 |  Baggy trousers as well, I think.
[7673.52 - 7675.52] P:1815.62 E:0.060494 |  He likes madness.
[7675.52 - 7677.52] P:1850.15 E:0.072672 |  Yes, he does.
[7677.52 - 7680.52] P:1799.98 E:0.069731 |  He has Hummels, who heads it forward,
[7680.52 - 7682.52] P:1779.53 E:0.081137 |  and Werner coming back from an offside position.
[7682.52 - 7683.52] P:1820.40 E:0.071946 |  That'll be familiar.
[7683.52 - 7686.52] P:1681.93 E:0.075900 |  The Chelsea fans who are here inside Wendley Stadium,
[7686.52 - 7687.52] P:1734.34 E:0.066855 |  Werner offside.
[7687.52 - 7689.52] P:1687.92 E:0.058255 |  Well, that's a shock, yeah.
[7689.52 - 7691.52] P:1718.12 E:0.072036 |  Freakake England.
[7691.52 - 7693.52] P:1668.74 E:0.065995 |  It's very even now, isn't it?
[7693.52 - 7695.52] P:1718.98 E:0.059743 |  I think Germany started the best,
[7695.52 - 7697.52] P:1606.21 E:0.074612 |  England came strong for 10-15 minutes,
[7697.52 - 7699.52] P:1574.34 E:0.067278 |  and he's got 30s, come up the 39 minutes.
[7699.52 - 7701.52] P:1656.58 E:0.059269 |  It's very tight.
[7701.52 - 7703.52] P:1689.17 E:0.072458 |  Sterling, that's a heavy touch from Sterling,
[7703.52 - 7705.52] P:1712.18 E:0.072508 |  but he's just about kept possession.
[7705.52 - 7707.52] P:1752.98 E:0.087463 |  Here comes Kimmich.
[7707.52 - 7709.52] P:1800.75 E:0.081474 |  The ball bounces forward for Germany.
[7709.52 - 7711.52] P:1821.96 E:0.078739 |  Werner's stones was in quickly with the challenge.
[7711.52 - 7713.52] P:1916.40 E:0.071683 |  Freak's forward for Havertz, but Walker was across,
[7713.52 - 7715.52] P:1862.06 E:0.083195 |  and Walker got the touch,
[7715.52 - 7717.52] P:1854.77 E:0.076594 |  and then I think got his heels clipped by Havertz.
[7717.52 - 7719.52] P:1849.96 E:0.073348 |  He did, it's a Freakake.
[7719.52 - 7722.52] P:1834.01 E:0.082074 |  You know what he's thinking? Havertz is a young player with a lot of talent,
[7722.52 - 7724.52] P:1807.29 E:0.078764 |  but he's awareness at times.
[7724.52 - 7726.52] P:1796.17 E:0.074691 |  He doesn't see people around him.
[7727.52 - 7729.52] P:1910.97 E:0.074208 |  That's good. Back down pitch, say,
[7729.52 - 7731.52] P:1777.67 E:0.079480 |  behind the England goal to Karen Kearney.
[7731.52 - 7733.52] P:1824.22 E:0.072606 |  Karl Walker has been unbelievable.
[7733.52 - 7735.52] P:1714.89 E:0.071415 |  Every time there's been a mistake,
[7735.52 - 7737.52] P:1756.26 E:0.071287 |  he's there just to pick it up,
[7737.52 - 7739.52] P:1791.78 E:0.065489 |  but going back to that early point,
[7739.52 - 7741.52] P:1853.33 E:0.071191 |  there's too many touches when we attack down the right-hand side.
[7741.52 - 7743.52] P:1736.32 E:0.061872 |  I agree with Chris, get the ball in the box,
[7743.52 - 7745.52] P:1889.87 E:0.073329 |  because as soon as we start getting more numbers in there,
[7745.52 - 7747.52] P:1564.34 E:0.070109 |  what team are Werner, as he peels into the space
[7747.52 - 7749.52] P:1657.39 E:0.058729 |  and waits for us to give it away,
[7749.52 - 7751.52] P:1803.80 E:0.071351 |  and then he hits us on the counterattack.
[7751.52 - 7753.52] P:1515.01 E:0.061996 |  Thankfully, he hasn't been that great so far,
[7753.52 - 7755.52] P:1531.77 E:0.069914 |  that Germany would be saying,
[7755.52 - 7757.52] P:1484.42 E:0.062828 |  but we just need to be mindful.
[7757.52 - 7760.52] P:1626.87 E:0.071734 |  Saka, challenging for the ball near the edge of the...
[7761.52 - 7764.52] P:1550.76 E:0.074714 |  Germany, paneled the area, but Rudiger won it.
[7764.52 - 7766.52] P:1616.92 E:0.071575 |  Now Tony Kroos turns away.
[7766.52 - 7769.52] P:1646.49 E:0.071083 |  Kroos, so comfortable on the ball.
[7769.52 - 7771.52] P:1429.14 E:0.068401 |  Lovely balance.
[7771.52 - 7773.52] P:1718.91 E:0.069922 |  Kimmich, left-footed.
[7773.52 - 7775.52] P:1859.02 E:0.080719 |  Aerial ballstones headed away.
[7775.52 - 7778.52] P:1735.42 E:0.071464 |  Havertz was underneath that, but Magliar's underneath this one.
[7778.52 - 7780.52] P:1715.63 E:0.074011 |  And England have it back.
[7780.52 - 7782.52] P:1643.65 E:0.076478 |  Phillips just playing it to his partner, Rice.
[7782.52 - 7784.52] P:1623.21 E:0.069259 |  England.
[7784.52 - 7787.52] P:1713.09 E:0.074935 |  In possession on the edge of their own penalty area,
[7787.52 - 7790.52] P:1670.40 E:0.071443 |  and then going all the way back to John Stones,
[7790.52 - 7795.52] P:1790.92 E:0.072863 |  who turns away from Kuretska,
[7795.52 - 7797.52] P:1778.53 E:0.081750 |  and then plays the ball forward to Harry Kane,
[7797.52 - 7799.52] P:1710.55 E:0.084034 |  who's in his own half, and Kane plays the ball over the top,
[7799.52 - 7801.52] P:1748.41 E:0.074012 |  but beyond the run of Calvin Phillips.
[7801.52 - 7803.52] P:1836.53 E:0.078794 |  And Neuer, of course, was there.
[7803.52 - 7806.52] P:1768.41 E:0.078025 |  It's very fair, it's the first time we've saw Harry Kane in the game.
[7806.52 - 7809.52] P:1730.42 E:0.072262 |  Nice drop of good position, gets away from his man,
[7809.52 - 7811.52] P:1778.59 E:0.072166 |  overhits the pass, right idea.
[7811.52 - 7813.52] P:1818.65 E:0.068551 |  You kind of felt what he was trying to do,
[7813.52 - 7815.52] P:1712.45 E:0.073545 |  but it's the first time we've saw him in the game.
[7815.52 - 7817.52] P:1700.49 E:0.068108 |  And England need to get him in the game.
[7817.52 - 7821.52] P:1831.28 E:0.074912 |  As Garry Southgate said, he's England's most important player.
[7821.52 - 7825.52] P:1743.52 E:0.072629 |  And there were signs of promise in the match against Czech Republic,
[7825.52 - 7827.52] P:1633.73 E:0.068386 |  but he's been a peripheral figure.
[7827.52 - 7830.52] P:1661.33 E:0.072939 |  And as we say again, for whatever reason, there might be a reason,
[7830.52 - 7833.52] P:1559.00 E:0.068239 |  no Dominic Calvert-Lewin on the bench for England.
[7833.52 - 7840.52] P:1561.72 E:0.069578 |  As England played all the way back to Pickford in the goal to our right.
[7841.52 - 7844.52] P:1637.04 E:0.073565 |  Pickford, has a look, it's going to go long, which it does.
[7844.52 - 7847.52] P:1761.95 E:0.074010 |  Here is Kane now, in between two German players,
[7847.52 - 7850.52] P:1760.56 E:0.074361 |  and that's a very deep flick on in between the two of them,
[7850.52 - 7853.52] P:1626.42 E:0.068459 |  to Sterling, but Sterling had Ginter with him.
[7853.52 - 7856.52] P:1679.62 E:0.079783 |  And the ball is returned to Manuel Neuer,
[7856.52 - 7858.52] P:1798.95 E:0.084501 |  who's just out of his own penalty area.
[7858.52 - 7861.52] P:1808.49 E:0.071200 |  So, 40 minutes of play here at Wembley Stadium.
[7861.52 - 7864.52] P:1639.96 E:0.067099 |  England nil, Germany nil.
[7865.52 - 7868.52] P:1672.18 E:0.074460 |  Neuer, right-footed, towards Havertz,
[7868.52 - 7872.52] P:1705.23 E:0.074788 |  Maguire wins the header, Maguire again as it's hooked forward for Germany.
[7872.52 - 7875.52] P:1695.94 E:0.069658 |  Kimmich, rather shied away from that.
[7875.52 - 7882.52] P:1817.80 E:0.075410 |  And here's Stones, now, John Stones looks for the bobbing hair of Calvin Phillips.
[7882.52 - 7887.52] P:1628.47 E:0.071921 |  And England have it on the halfway line, Germany drop back into position.
[7887.52 - 7891.52] P:1614.96 E:0.074262 |  Kyle Walker receives it, and now Walker stepping forward,
[7891.52 - 7894.52] P:1664.95 E:0.074707 |  winning his 58th cap tonight, Kyle Walker.
[7894.52 - 7897.52] P:1743.69 E:0.074811 |  Phillips has to scamp her out towards the right-hand side
[7897.52 - 7899.52] P:1669.72 E:0.067714 |  to keep the ball in play from that pass to him.
[7899.52 - 7904.52] P:1770.99 E:0.072707 |  And England are forced back into their own half, and have to start again,
[7904.52 - 7906.52] P:1644.24 E:0.060639 |  which they do.
[7906.52 - 7909.52] P:1626.73 E:0.068979 |  Here's Maguire now, Maguire forwards towards Kane,
[7909.52 - 7913.52] P:1846.36 E:0.078025 |  Kane turns and sets off goal, which Goretzka makes the challenge.
[7913.52 - 7915.52] P:1876.64 E:0.079012 |  Referee says free kick.
[7915.52 - 7919.52] P:1769.18 E:0.080060 |  Goretzka in again, his challenge is mounting up now,
[7919.52 - 7922.52] P:1761.97 E:0.071520 |  and that's a free kick to England in another decent position.
[7922.52 - 7926.52] P:1704.82 E:0.072797 |  And Harry Maguire just comes across to the referee and stands in front of him,
[7926.52 - 7929.52] P:1674.04 E:0.077175 |  and I think is making probably that very point about Goretzka.
[7929.52 - 7932.52] P:1822.96 E:0.081703 |  Goretzka's saying when he sees the replay, he's not really in a lot of contact.
[7932.52 - 7935.52] P:1764.14 E:0.070246 |  Harry Kane goes down holding his ankle,
[7935.52 - 7939.52] P:1749.38 E:0.077262 |  the referee waits a couple of seconds and then decides to give it in a good position here.
[7939.52 - 7942.52] P:1734.73 E:0.071331 |  Really, you've got to be looking to shot and target.
[7942.52 - 7946.52] P:1725.96 E:0.072379 |  I wondered whether Harry Kane might have been tempted himself to have a goal,
[7946.52 - 7948.52] P:1803.28 E:0.075699 |  maybe just a little bit too far out.
[7948.52 - 7951.52] P:1772.42 E:0.075052 |  I think Tripp Fancy's it, and we know he's quite good on dead ball situations,
[7951.52 - 7955.52] P:1785.63 E:0.072343 |  so it'll fancy that, but I wouldn't be surprised if he crosses it.
[7955.52 - 7961.52] P:1818.83 E:0.075047 |  Just seeing on our screen, as well as Prince George, the Kane Bridges,
[7961.52 - 7968.52] P:1745.66 E:0.071399 |  Skinner and Bedeal, David Beckham and Ed Sheeran are also over there on the far side,
[7968.52 - 7970.52] P:1729.34 E:0.067055 |  sitting next to one another.
[7970.52 - 7973.52] P:1832.43 E:0.073565 |  That's a real fly on the wall, isn't it?
[7973.52 - 7977.52] P:1961.90 E:0.071759 |  Trippie at and Shaw with this free kick.
[7977.52 - 7980.52] P:1860.39 E:0.075019 |  Germans have put up a three-man wall, half-time approaching.
[7980.52 - 7982.52] P:1801.16 E:0.072628 |  Trippie plays the game, Kane's after this,
[7982.52 - 7986.52] P:1749.18 E:0.074704 |  but Hummels got there first ahead of Harry Kane and heads it behind.
[7986.52 - 7989.52] P:1816.77 E:0.078932 |  Harry Kane actually puts his hands on his head there.
[7989.52 - 7992.52] P:1831.00 E:0.077682 |  I think they were looking for an offside.
[7992.52 - 7996.52] P:1843.29 E:0.075687 |  He gets behind Hummels, but the ball has no place on it,
[7996.52 - 7999.52] P:1828.11 E:0.079619 |  and give Hummels credit, he recovers very, very well.
[7999.52 - 8000.52] P:1857.87 E:0.066307 |  He does.
[8000.52 - 8003.52] P:1813.19 E:0.068043 |  So it's a corner, half-time approaching.
[8003.52 - 8009.52] P:1760.24 E:0.061135 |  It would, of course, as you will know, be a great time to get a goal just before the break.
[8009.52 - 8012.52] P:1725.51 E:0.068281 |  Trippie with this, lots of movement in the box.
[8012.52 - 8014.52] P:1828.46 E:0.070055 |  It's swung into the edge of the six-yard box,
[8014.52 - 8018.52] P:1770.03 E:0.067246 |  but a German head on that, and it's kept in on the far side and played forward,
[8018.52 - 8021.52] P:1801.87 E:0.072439 |  but that's back to possession for England, or it should be.
[8021.52 - 8025.52] P:1895.70 E:0.073273 |  Phillips actually, with habits not too far away, goes back to Pickford.
[8025.52 - 8029.52] P:1835.06 E:0.070817 |  Trippie is calling for it, over there on the far side from his goalkeeper,
[8029.52 - 8031.52] P:1659.27 E:0.060403 |  and Pickford now tries to pick him out.
[8031.52 - 8035.52] P:1722.52 E:0.069779 |  He's picked out Phillips on the half-way line, who takes that down, and then Havards fouls him.
[8035.52 - 8037.52] P:1747.57 E:0.074202 |  But the referee says play on.
[8037.52 - 8038.52] P:1742.20 E:0.072791 |  England are in possession.
[8038.52 - 8043.52] P:1610.33 E:0.065715 |  Stones back out there towards the right-hand side to clip forward.
[8043.52 - 8046.52] P:1695.37 E:0.069400 |  Sackers after this get some contact on that, but the ball runs out of play,
[8046.52 - 8047.52] P:1788.28 E:0.079540 |  and it's a throw to the Germans.
[8047.52 - 8051.52] P:1728.86 E:0.075539 |  Sackers started quite bravely, but the last half an hour, he's thrown it hard to get in the game.
[8051.52 - 8054.52] P:1731.58 E:0.068537 |  He's not getting a lot of joy on that right-hand side.
[8054.52 - 8056.52] P:1602.22 E:0.074525 |  Maybe him and Sterling could swap over for the...
[8056.52 - 8059.52] P:1740.08 E:0.056778 |  Well, it'll be second half now, because it's come up the half-time.
[8059.52 - 8061.52] P:1680.72 E:0.058558 |  England nil, Germany nil.
[8061.52 - 8064.52] P:1709.95 E:0.064210 |  It's been entertaining. You certainly can't take your eyes off it, Chris.
[8066.52 - 8067.52] P:1681.35 E:0.086652 |  Germany clearing the ball away.
[8067.52 - 8069.52] P:1693.23 E:0.066958 |  Cross takes it down.
[8069.52 - 8072.52] P:1709.04 E:0.076531 |  Cross just forward over centre-circle, and Calvin Phillips in with the challenge.
[8072.52 - 8075.52] P:1683.39 E:0.076431 |  That's going to be a yellow card as well, I think, for Phillips.
[8075.52 - 8078.52] P:1771.20 E:0.074675 |  A little like Goretzka, he's put in a number of challenges,
[8078.52 - 8080.52] P:1776.00 E:0.066404 |  and if that is a yellow, it is.
[8080.52 - 8082.52] P:1712.38 E:0.071717 |  There it is, the flash of yellow.
[8082.52 - 8086.52] P:1625.81 E:0.068773 |  That means both of England's central midfielders are on the yellow card now in this match.
[8086.52 - 8088.52] P:1747.33 E:0.078057 |  Well, it makes it sort of Phillips down.
[8088.52 - 8092.52] P:1788.64 E:0.060306 |  Look, he's got the ball, his foot's ruled over the ball, into cross,
[8092.52 - 8096.52] P:1772.89 E:0.061017 |  and it is a bad challenge when you look at it on the replay.
[8096.52 - 8098.52] P:1673.77 E:0.068594 |  It was a yellow, definitely.
[8098.52 - 8100.52] P:1675.93 E:0.058837 |  It could have been worse that.
[8100.52 - 8101.52] P:1729.09 E:0.064715 |  Right.
[8101.52 - 8102.52] P:1634.31 E:0.069140 |  Maybe looking at that.
[8102.52 - 8104.52] P:1681.20 E:0.065761 |  Let's see. Well, there will be looking at it.
[8104.52 - 8108.52] P:1604.28 E:0.068395 |  That's an absolute racing certainty that the AR will be considering it.
[8108.52 - 8112.52] P:1628.57 E:0.065079 |  Now, there's nothing yet to indicate that there is a check going on.
[8112.52 - 8115.52] P:1688.35 E:0.072499 |  The referee's just put his hand to his ear.
[8115.52 - 8119.52] P:1623.13 E:0.065610 |  One minute of added time, and he says play on.
[8119.52 - 8123.52] P:1746.73 E:0.073457 |  I saw on the screen a little expression on Kara Southgate's face,
[8123.52 - 8128.52] P:1712.57 E:0.066617 |  which certainly betrayed the fact that he was concerned about that.
[8128.52 - 8131.52] P:1581.93 E:0.065943 |  Havert in the centre circle.
[8131.52 - 8137.52] P:1538.45 E:0.070420 |  Just taking the ball back into his own half, and then playing it back towards Hummels.
[8137.52 - 8141.52] P:1666.25 E:0.068571 |  Now, Ginter to the right-hand side, but it's been tight.
[8141.52 - 8143.52] P:1673.91 E:0.058199 |  It was very little in it.
[8143.52 - 8147.52] P:1756.32 E:0.071160 |  Almost anyone you spoke to about this game said it was very difficult to call,
[8147.52 - 8150.52] P:1777.21 E:0.063665 |  and it has been extremely even.
[8152.52 - 8154.52] P:1528.36 E:0.081451 |  Here's Muller on the right-hand side.
[8154.52 - 8156.52] P:1894.53 E:0.080611 |  All that pass was short from Thomas Muller.
[8156.52 - 8158.52] P:1885.17 E:0.072535 |  Sterling was on to it in a flash.
[8158.52 - 8160.52] P:1857.18 E:0.075500 |  Sterling now carrying it in field.
[8160.52 - 8162.52] P:1884.35 E:0.079026 |  Still going to the edge of the box. Still going.
[8162.52 - 8164.52] P:1939.28 E:0.080102 |  The challenge comes in. It bounces to Kane.
[8164.52 - 8166.52] P:1850.20 E:0.078228 |  Kane's almost in, and then a sliding challenge on him.
[8166.52 - 8168.52] P:1841.98 E:0.075602 |  Or crucially from Hummels.
[8168.52 - 8170.52] P:1785.24 E:0.072378 |  And Kane couldn't convert.
[8170.52 - 8173.52] P:1739.89 E:0.076518 |  There's been a foul on Sterling on the edge of the box. I'm not sure.
[8173.52 - 8175.52] P:1661.06 E:0.075482 |  No, it wasn't. He went down.
[8175.52 - 8177.52] P:1736.70 E:0.076121 |  The referee was in a great position.
[8177.52 - 8179.52] P:1852.41 E:0.074223 |  Verna's breaking it.
[8179.52 - 8181.52] P:1764.64 E:0.069015 |  Could easily have bounced for Harry Kane in the box,
[8181.52 - 8183.52] P:1811.84 E:0.065945 |  but what great work by Hummels. What a recovery.
[8183.52 - 8186.52] P:1856.95 E:0.065372 |  Germany coming forward now in this added minute at the end of the first half.
[8186.52 - 8189.52] P:1921.22 E:0.080719 |  That all came from Thomas Muller's poor ball.
[8189.52 - 8192.52] P:1831.47 E:0.077056 |  And there's the halftime whistle, and it's 0-0.
[8192.52 - 8194.52] P:1787.20 E:0.072564 |  Chris Waddle.
[8194.52 - 8196.52] P:1670.11 E:0.075886 |  We've got to say, Jeremy started very, very well.
[8196.52 - 8198.52] P:1699.85 E:0.069660 |  Really in control. The first 10, 15 minutes.
[8198.52 - 8205.52] P:1780.26 E:0.060374 |  The Darkeration beginning in cycles.
[8205.52 - 8207.52] P:1871.09 E:0.061186 |  And now, it's in the middle of a dribble.
[8207.52 - 8223.88] P:1837.76 E:0.065943 |  We're outside the both
[8223.88 - 8226.18] P:1727.82 E:0.070275 |  It's amazing to see you.
[8226.18 - 8229.38] P:1730.06 E:0.071276 |  we started to deal with the
[8229.38 - 8230.58] P:1751.45 E:0.061808 |  little pocket player England
[8230.58 - 8231.18] P:1629.26 E:0.072166 |  were a lot better and started
[8231.18 - 8232.78] P:1728.77 E:0.059621 |  to build a little bit more
[8232.78 - 8233.38] P:1458.11 E:0.060640 |  confidence. I think from my
[8233.38 - 8234.38] P:1850.82 E:0.069339 |  angle, John Stowe's is the one
[8234.38 - 8235.98] P:1643.77 E:0.062291 |  that really settled England down
[8235.98 - 8237.18] P:1654.54 E:0.065709 |  receiving it under pressure,
[8237.18 - 8238.18] P:1718.94 E:0.058428 |  moving it. We've had moments
[8238.18 - 8239.78] P:1677.12 E:0.057739 |  we look threatening from set
[8239.78 - 8241.38] P:1757.35 E:0.071350 |  plays. We have to stop the
[8241.38 - 8242.38] P:1939.83 E:0.074580 |  crosses because I think we
[8242.38 - 8244.18] P:1538.97 E:0.061464 |  should have been one nil down
[8244.18 - 8245.78] P:1669.31 E:0.066368 |  from that initial one that the
[8245.78 - 8247.18] P:1570.26 E:0.050894 |  cross came in. We've got
[8247.18 - 8248.78] P:1611.07 E:0.067520 |  cleared and never the chance
[8248.78 - 8250.78] P:1463.34 E:0.057517 |  then later on, but we're still
[8250.78 - 8252.18] P:1542.75 E:0.072678 |  in the game. What was about
[8252.18 - 8253.78] P:1742.37 E:0.063554 |  moments and hopefully we'll see
[8253.78 - 8254.78] P:1659.59 E:0.058469 |  the sub form often. I think
[8254.78 - 8256.78] P:1336.72 E:0.045890 |  we'll see the end of the
[8256.78 - 8257.78] P:1603.27 E:0.057970 |  game. We've got a little bit
[8257.78 - 8259.78] P:1793.32 E:0.065884 |  of confidence in the game. We
[8259.78 - 8262.78] P:1759.06 E:0.068709 |  have to get to 60 minutes. Thank
[8262.78 - 8264.78] P:1700.53 E:0.060886 |  you, Karen. After confess, I
[8264.78 - 8266.78] P:1658.25 E:0.061909 |  did feel that there would be a
[8266.78 - 8268.78] P:1731.76 E:0.069315 |  winner to this game inside 90
[8268.78 - 8269.78] P:1851.16 E:0.059728 |  minutes. But at halftime,
[8269.78 - 8270.78] P:1833.87 E:0.039732 |  England, nil Germany, nil
[8270.78 - 8272.78] P:1727.73 E:0.048148 |  means that there is that little
[8272.78 - 8274.78] P:1681.49 E:0.069528 |  thought there that we are 45
[8274.78 - 8275.78] P:1872.85 E:0.067319 |  minutes closer to penalties.
[8275.78 - 8278.78] P:1651.84 E:0.074629 |  Mark Chapman. Chris Waddle
[8278.78 - 8280.78] P:1631.61 E:0.063918 |  that mean this loads to get out
[8280.78 - 8282.78] P:1651.29 E:0.064327 |  from that half, but just on the
[8282.78 - 8283.78] P:1706.84 E:0.081548 |  final thing was up. First of
[8283.78 - 8285.78] P:1695.38 E:0.068281 |  all, it's a good game. It's a
[8285.78 - 8287.78] P:1819.62 E:0.061789 |  good game. It's a good game.
[8287.78 - 8288.78] P:1699.37 E:0.070641 |  It's a good game. It's a good
[8288.78 - 8289.78] P:1986.43 E:0.066677 |  game. It's a good game. It's an
[8289.78 - 8291.78] P:1810.42 E:0.076620 |  unbelievable last pitch tackle.
[8291.78 - 8292.78] P:1854.19 E:0.054795 |  It's brilliant on it, isn't it?
[8292.78 - 8293.78] P:1797.02 E:0.060369 |  You just think it's a goal,
[8293.78 - 8294.78] P:1891.80 E:0.063538 |  didn't you? It's Harry Kane
[8294.78 - 8295.78] P:1815.52 E:0.044204 |  touches it. You think it's a
[8295.78 - 8296.78] P:1981.06 E:0.016705 |  goal and he arrives from
[8296.78 - 8297.78] P:1759.82 E:0.050238 |  nowhere and big long legs come
[8297.78 - 8298.78] P:1857.47 E:0.077304 |  and get the ball away again.
[8298.78 - 8299.78] P:1259.19 E:0.068962 |  Yeah, brilliant.
[8299.78 - 8301.78] P:1565.99 E:0.071523 |  Michael, it's ebbed and flowed,
[8301.78 - 8303.78] P:1717.60 E:0.070379 |  hasn't it? Both sides have had
[8303.78 - 8305.78] P:1794.15 E:0.073331 |  spells when they're on top. What
[8305.78 - 8307.78] P:1934.15 E:0.046122 |  strikes me as a difference is
[8307.78 - 8309.78] P:1794.12 E:0.076914 |  that Germany will try to move
[8309.78 - 8311.78] P:1730.49 E:0.070374 |  it forward quickly. And if
[8311.78 - 8312.78] P:1782.21 E:0.071940 |  they don't, they're not going to
[8312.78 - 8314.78] P:1747.21 E:0.067386 |  get it back.
[8314.78 - 8316.78] P:1717.28 E:0.062698 |  What is it? Where is England
[8316.78 - 8317.78] P:1504.86 E:0.032928 |  don't seem to want to move it
[8317.78 - 8318.78] P:1503.16 E:0.067305 |  forward quickly and are a lot
[8318.78 - 8319.78] P:1491.12 E:0.068589 |  more patient?
[8319.78 - 8322.78] P:1764.04 E:0.070021 |  Yeah, I think England are a bit
[8322.78 - 8324.78] P:1715.65 E:0.055957 |  too patient. You see Shaw's
[8324.78 - 8327.78] P:1879.74 E:0.066134 |  hanging wide, the ball's being
[8327.78 - 8329.78] P:1773.80 E:0.065971 |  going at him too slow, and then
[8329.78 - 8330.78] P:1949.43 E:0.067413 |  the other side, Trippians put
[8330.78 - 8331.78] P:1703.56 E:0.080712 |  some good crosses in, but
[8331.78 - 8332.78] P:1993.34 E:0.076060 |  everything's just too label. It's
[8332.78 - 8334.78] P:1816.36 E:0.062412 |  almost like they were shell
[8334.78 - 8335.78] P:1841.96 E:0.065632 |  shocked a little bit, you know,
[8335.78 - 8337.78] P:1922.81 E:0.069571 |  because Germany started the
[8337.78 - 8339.78] P:1954.24 E:0.068918 |  game so well that it was on the
[8339.78 - 8340.78] P:1851.10 E:0.055778 |  back foot. They grew into the
[8340.78 - 8341.78] P:1467.92 E:0.084621 |  back foot.
[8341.78 - 8343.78] P:1801.97 E:0.053909 |  They're going to see a little bit
[8343.78 - 8344.78] P:1892.84 E:0.070373 |  more.
[8344.78 - 8346.78] P:1679.82 E:0.065434 |  Ginter at the back, he's on a
[8346.78 - 8348.78] P:1947.16 E:0.076190 |  yellow card. They need to have a
[8348.78 - 8350.78] P:1805.48 E:0.061954 |  real good run at him. Sterling
[8350.78 - 8352.78] P:1753.89 E:0.064472 |  tried towards the end of the
[8352.78 - 8354.78] P:1835.01 E:0.059327 |  half, but it's almost like they
[8354.78 - 8356.78] P:1807.46 E:0.059468 |  don't believe in this. This
[8356.78 - 8358.78] P:1861.83 E:0.060787 |  Germany side is there for the
[8358.78 - 8360.78] P:1834.03 E:0.083040 |  taking if they believe.
[8360.78 - 8362.78] P:1900.66 E:0.077238 |  Maurice Volts is with us as
[8362.78 - 8364.78] P:1825.31 E:0.077127 |  well. We will talk to
[8364.78 - 8366.78] P:1837.33 E:0.070315 |  Moritz in just a little while.
[8366.78 - 8368.78] P:1863.79 E:0.062131 |  Karen, you were talking about
[8368.78 - 8370.78] P:1874.57 E:0.077414 |  the crossfield ball, and the
[8370.78 - 8372.78] P:1798.79 E:0.062660 |  crossfield ball is a threat.
[8372.78 - 8373.78] P:1794.09 E:0.075600 |  We've got a lot of crossfield
[8373.78 - 8375.78] P:1867.06 E:0.069012 |  balls and the crosses that the
[8375.78 - 8377.78] P:1767.39 E:0.070940 |  Germans are putting in. I've got
[8377.78 - 8378.78] P:1702.23 E:0.065562 |  just with Kimmings past
[8378.78 - 8380.78] P:1890.87 E:0.076846 |  completion in front of me, which
[8380.78 - 8382.78] P:1858.56 E:0.066661 |  is only 62%, but that kind of
[8382.78 - 8384.78] P:1851.12 E:0.069789 |  bears the point that he's happy
[8384.78 - 8386.78] P:1720.84 E:0.072497 |  to put it in. He's happy to try
[8386.78 - 8387.78] P:1527.28 E:0.064555 |  and hit Werner with that
[8387.78 - 8388.78] P:1294.97 E:0.037576 |  crossfield ball. And if it
[8388.78 - 8390.78] P:1860.91 E:0.070936 |  doesn't quite work out, then so
[8390.78 - 8391.78] P:1722.31 E:0.064664 |  beer, but they're going to try
[8391.78 - 8393.78] P:1935.68 E:0.070613 |  it to get behind the England
[8393.78 - 8394.78] P:1924.73 E:0.066053 |  back three.
[8394.78 - 8395.78] P:1917.99 E:0.067923 |  Yeah, definitely the balls in
[8395.78 - 8397.78] P:1744.42 E:0.055398 |  behind is a threat, especially
[8397.78 - 8399.78] P:1697.86 E:0.054190 |  when it comes to the
[8399.78 - 8400.78] P:1860.07 E:0.058867 |  backfield ball. And then he's
[8400.78 - 8402.78] P:1812.62 E:0.067998 |  going to try to get behind it.
[8402.78 - 8403.78] P:1735.22 E:0.034120 |  Thankfully, Werner's not been
[8403.78 - 8405.78] P:1744.75 E:0.063538 |  at the races for England, but
[8405.78 - 8407.78] P:1858.79 E:0.061819 |  there was a 30 second period
[8407.78 - 8409.78] P:1803.00 E:0.060235 |  where the cross came in from the
[8409.78 - 8410.78] P:2086.70 E:0.061961 |  right hand side and stones and
[8410.78 - 8412.78] P:1678.31 E:0.056267 |  McGuire weren't there and dealt
[8412.78 - 8414.78] P:1671.53 E:0.061845 |  with it. Straight after that,
[8414.78 - 8415.78] P:1823.38 E:0.071530 |  then, was the chance where we
[8415.78 - 8416.78] P:1737.91 E:0.063624 |  spoke about Pickford not having
[8416.78 - 8418.78] P:2071.54 E:0.058528 |  to do anything. I don't think
[8418.78 - 8419.78] P:1811.19 E:0.032485 |  we've really applauded him
[8419.78 - 8420.78] P:1858.02 E:0.058817 |  enough. He came straight out and
[8420.78 - 8422.78] P:2168.77 E:0.074380 |  stopped that Werner chance.
[8422.78 - 8424.78] P:1958.04 E:0.055636 |  He was brilliant. I was really
[8424.78 - 8425.78] P:1817.54 E:0.066041 |  close up because Werner should
[8425.78 - 8426.78] P:2070.64 E:0.065267 |  have scored, but Pickford was
[8426.78 - 8428.78] P:1821.14 E:0.055752 |  really good at that. And then
[8428.78 - 8430.78] P:1803.66 E:0.055887 |  he's been able to get past
[8430.78 - 8431.78] P:1840.03 E:0.051431 |  the end of the ball. The rest
[8431.78 - 8432.78] P:1834.47 E:0.045717 |  of it. I've been like this
[8432.78 - 8433.78] P:1859.16 E:0.079382 |  game is just calling out for
[8433.78 - 8434.78] P:1900.68 E:0.051236 |  the subs. You know, we're a
[8434.78 - 8435.78] P:1813.62 E:0.072994 |  sub is going to come on and
[8435.78 - 8436.78] P:1687.73 E:0.055694 |  win it for me. This group on
[8436.78 - 8437.78] P:1833.30 E:0.058471 |  there. I don't think we're at
[8437.78 - 8438.78] P:1784.31 E:0.052782 |  the moment. It's going to be
[8438.78 - 8439.78] P:1847.12 E:0.063229 |  Seattle's moments and there's
[8439.78 - 8440.78] P:1752.68 E:0.068674 |  going to be a match winner
[8440.78 - 8441.78] P:1790.79 E:0.078464 |  that's going to come on when
[8441.78 - 8442.78] P:1878.92 E:0.033171 |  the game's a little bit more
[8442.78 - 8444.78] P:1889.25 E:0.074495 |  stretched. Spring Morris
[8444.78 - 8446.78] P:1848.89 E:0.072584 |  vaulting. Then are you content
[8446.78 - 8448.78] P:1985.01 E:0.053578 |  with that first 45 you
[8448.78 - 8451.78] P:1891.73 E:0.047939 |  concerned?
[8451.78 - 8453.78] P:1849.76 E:0.068007 |  I'm happy, but still tense. I
[8453.78 - 8454.78] P:1809.78 E:0.066560 |  think it's been an even game.
[8454.78 - 8457.78] P:1958.57 E:0.051365 |  I'm happy with that, because I
[8457.78 - 8460.78] P:1951.54 E:0.066359 |  expected us to have a very
[8460.78 - 8462.78] P:1896.25 E:0.070700 |  tricky game, and I thought we
[8462.78 - 8465.78] P:1973.52 E:0.052449 |  got into the game well, and it's
[8465.78 - 8467.78] P:2009.70 E:0.053528 |  been very even.
[8467.78 - 8468.78] P:1973.52 E:0.072378 |  Tim, I've earned a should
[8468.78 - 8470.78] P:1877.17 E:0.040749 |  have scored that chance. They
[8470.78 - 8472.78] P:1861.61 E:0.051776 |  shouldn't have more it.
[8472.78 - 8474.78] P:1743.29 E:0.066338 |  Well, he's coming in at an
[8474.78 - 8476.78] P:1766.24 E:0.065105 |  angle and pick put as well to
[8476.78 - 8479.78] P:1908.10 E:0.055678 |  go down to decrease the angle.
[8479.78 - 8481.78] P:1916.17 E:0.052378 |  You think perhaps he could have
[8481.78 - 8483.78] P:1868.15 E:0.061932 |  chipped it, but I'd like to
[8483.78 - 8485.78] P:1846.94 E:0.035313 |  go down to the left and pick up
[8485.78 - 8486.78] P:1727.56 E:0.078263 |  on the right.
[8486.78 - 8488.78] P:1856.13 E:0.054509 |  I'm happy with that, but I'm
[8488.78 - 8489.78] P:1842.51 E:0.069116 |  happy with that.
[8489.78 - 8490.78] P:1853.17 E:0.066692 |  I'm happy with that, because I
[8490.78 - 8491.78] P:1927.26 E:0.037390 |  think we're going to get to the
[8491.78 - 8493.78] P:1896.58 E:0.071305 |  bottom of this one.
[8493.78 - 8494.78] P:1722.49 E:0.055965 |  As Karen was saying as well,
[8494.78 - 8495.78] P:1823.71 E:0.072599 |  Chris, the start of that
[8495.78 - 8498.78] P:1847.25 E:0.071005 |  first half, the positions that
[8498.78 - 8500.78] P:1856.76 E:0.070351 |  Muller was taking up, and to a
[8500.78 - 8502.78] P:1780.47 E:0.065516 |  certain extent, the positions
[8502.78 - 8503.78] P:1731.12 E:0.069479 |  Havards was taking up were
[8503.78 - 8504.78] P:1971.00 E:0.068000 |  causing him more problems,
[8504.78 - 8505.78] P:1884.74 E:0.061545 |  because the back three didn't
[8505.78 - 8507.78] P:1841.55 E:0.064417 |  go with where Muller or
[8507.78 - 8509.78] P:1827.10 E:0.054801 |  Havards were.
[8509.78 - 8510.78] P:1617.55 E:0.064718 |  What happens is Muller comes
[8510.78 - 8512.78] P:1841.10 E:0.067466 |  towards the ball.
[8512.78 - 8513.78] P:2007.86 E:0.065359 |  He's going to roll it through the
[8513.78 - 8515.78] P:1952.66 E:0.064108 |  gap, but we know he's very, very
[8515.78 - 8517.78] P:1971.42 E:0.051675 |  quick to run on to.
[8517.78 - 8518.78] P:1892.63 E:0.071519 |  So they were very reluctant to
[8518.78 - 8520.78] P:1871.19 E:0.061594 |  go out and stones to go in with
[8520.78 - 8521.78] P:1862.76 E:0.053610 |  Thomas Muller.
[8521.78 - 8523.78] P:1968.83 E:0.059780 |  Thomas Muller, by first ten
[8523.78 - 8524.78] P:1971.17 E:0.054360 |  minutes, basically controls the
[8524.78 - 8525.78] P:1802.45 E:0.053629 |  game.
[8525.78 - 8527.78] P:1902.61 E:0.055977 |  But then they squeezed up the
[8527.78 - 8528.78] P:1849.29 E:0.079445 |  target a little bit more, and
[8528.78 - 8530.78] P:2005.17 E:0.059007 |  Verna started running offside, so
[8530.78 - 8531.78] P:1816.82 E:0.076765 |  England then got a little bit
[8531.78 - 8532.78] P:1945.80 E:0.054308 |  higher, but I still think we need
[8532.78 - 8534.78] P:1938.53 E:0.056637 |  more from the two wingbacks.
[8534.78 - 8535.78] P:1937.86 E:0.079354 |  They don't get forward early
[8535.78 - 8536.78] P:1807.13 E:0.053553 |  enough, they don't want to run
[8536.78 - 8537.78] P:1912.80 E:0.061064 |  forward early enough.
[8537.78 - 8539.78] P:1973.51 E:0.065083 |  Go high, go high.
[8539.78 - 8541.78] P:1866.88 E:0.062769 |  She's hitting again the ball
[8541.78 - 8542.78] P:1870.00 E:0.054324 |  early enough.
[8542.78 - 8543.78] P:1734.77 E:0.062579 |  England's wingbacks.
[8543.78 - 8545.78] P:1823.26 E:0.073060 |  Two or three times down here on
[8545.78 - 8546.78] P:1912.12 E:0.070048 |  the left, which has been the
[8546.78 - 8547.78] P:1827.77 E:0.077686 |  closest side to us in our first
[8547.78 - 8549.78] P:1929.83 E:0.069182 |  half, Luke Shaw has been in
[8549.78 - 8551.78] P:1872.77 E:0.063442 |  plenty of space, lots of space
[8551.78 - 8553.78] P:1948.82 E:0.069596 |  because Sterling's gone inside.
[8553.78 - 8555.78] P:1831.66 E:0.051377 |  And the ball just hasn't come,
[8555.78 - 8557.78] P:1681.42 E:0.064501 |  and by the time it has come,
[8557.78 - 8559.78] P:1813.22 E:0.053050 |  Shaw's got two men near him.
[8559.78 - 8561.78] P:1721.52 E:0.064026 |  Exactly that, Chappers.
[8561.78 - 8563.78] P:1764.12 E:0.058314 |  I mentioned, and I asked JJ
[8563.78 - 8565.78] P:1804.20 E:0.054472 |  before the game, how he
[8565.78 - 8567.78] P:1815.68 E:0.057763 |  you see that midfield battle
[8567.78 - 8569.78] P:1884.71 E:0.043535 |  going, and to fair to
[8569.78 - 8571.78] P:1901.55 E:0.067276 |  Phillips, he's pushing on and
[8571.78 - 8573.78] P:1831.44 E:0.050366 |  trying to get involved.
[8573.78 - 8575.78] P:1745.72 E:0.058892 |  But Rice in this game, I don't
[8575.78 - 8577.78] P:1627.95 E:0.070968 |  know if he's on a yellow card
[8577.78 - 8579.78] P:1830.18 E:0.058369 |  now, but he seems to be playing
[8579.78 - 8581.78] P:1825.53 E:0.066302 |  with himself just a little bit,
[8581.78 - 8583.78] P:1696.38 E:0.057768 |  and he's playing the simple
[8583.78 - 8584.78] P:1514.44 E:0.056790 |  ball.
[8584.78 - 8585.78] P:1404.78 E:0.073226 |  There's so many times where
[8585.78 - 8587.78] P:1869.99 E:0.053907 |  Shaw's been wide, Trippie's
[8587.78 - 8589.78] P:1823.08 E:0.057750 |  been wide, and they've just
[8589.78 - 8591.78] P:1807.43 E:0.057023 |  played the safe ball, and Rice
[8591.78 - 8593.78] P:1899.29 E:0.065327 |  he can do it, he's good enough to
[8593.78 - 8595.78] P:1750.26 E:0.066290 |  play that ball, but I don't know
[8595.78 - 8597.78] P:1801.28 E:0.048941 |  if there's a little bit too much
[8597.78 - 8599.78] P:1713.03 E:0.063208 |  about Germany, but the need
[8599.78 - 8601.78] P:1772.19 E:0.055823 |  to get the ball forward
[8601.78 - 8603.78] P:1767.24 E:0.052100 |  quicker with quality as well.
[8603.78 - 8605.78] P:1747.86 E:0.029825 |  Moritz, do you make
[8605.78 - 8607.78] P:1924.54 E:0.077349 |  changes at halftime? Do you leave
[8607.78 - 8609.78] P:1820.13 E:0.077306 |  everything as it is for the time being
[8609.78 - 8611.78] P:1929.93 E:0.042748 |  from a German perspective?
[8611.78 - 8613.78] P:1956.66 E:0.059410 |  Yes, leave things as they are.
[8613.78 - 8615.78] P:1935.18 E:0.044840 |  Like I said, we've
[8615.78 - 8617.78] P:1875.29 E:0.068367 |  created some chances,
[8617.78 - 8619.78] P:1899.09 E:0.058045 |  and there are
[8619.78 - 8621.78] P:1914.22 E:0.042550 |  good performances out there.
[8621.78 - 8623.78] P:1878.77 E:0.055450 |  I don't have anybody that I would
[8623.78 - 8625.78] P:1821.27 E:0.080940 |  pick out on the German team where
[8625.78 - 8627.78] P:1821.97 E:0.067335 |  I'd say he doesn't deserve to go into
[8627.78 - 8629.78] P:1815.08 E:0.036961 |  the second half.
[8629.78 - 8631.78] P:1861.92 E:0.072218 |  Moritz, for the moment, thank you Moritz
[8631.78 - 8633.78] P:1828.01 E:0.073636 |  Vols with us, as is
[8633.78 - 8635.78] P:1858.78 E:0.059756 |  Micah Richards, Karen Carney and Chris
[8635.78 - 8637.78] P:1733.33 E:0.079579 |  Waddle. Goal-less at halftime then here

[8705.78 - 8707.78] P:1605.44 E:0.080289 |  Listen live on digital,
[8707.78 - 8709.78] P:1716.47 E:0.075709 |  online, smart speaker
[8709.78 - 8711.78] P:1723.98 E:0.070004 |  or the BBC Sounds app.
[8711.78 - 8713.78] P:1702.53 E:0.079583 |  If you're on the road, just be aware
[8713.78 - 8715.78] P:1809.31 E:0.065783 |  the M62 westbound is still closed
[8715.78 - 8717.78] P:2007.87 E:0.069351 |  from junction 22, Rishworth-more
[8717.78 - 8719.78] P:1816.79 E:0.078461 |  to 21 at Milmrow.
[8719.78 - 8721.78] P:1607.58 E:0.074115 |  It's because of the earlier lorry fire
[8721.78 - 8723.78] P:1333.36 E:0.070828 |  recovery work is still going on there
[8723.78 - 8725.78] P:1466.44 E:0.066145 |  and other people have been stuck for five, six hours
[8725.78 - 8727.78] P:1862.36 E:0.071692 |  but they are managing now to release the trap
[8727.78 - 8729.78] P:1666.47 E:0.076398 |  traffic using the eastbound side.
[8729.78 - 8731.78] P:1611.26 E:0.070538 |  So as a result, eastbound has two lanes closed
[8731.78 - 8733.78] P:1671.73 E:0.067796 |  from 21 Milrow to 22
[8733.78 - 8735.78] P:1524.92 E:0.074336 |  at Rishworth-more. As you'd imagine
[8735.78 - 8737.78] P:1743.08 E:0.073079 |  it's very busy in the area.
[8737.78 - 8739.78] P:1625.29 E:0.069310 |  And the M25 anti-clockwise at junction one
[8739.78 - 8741.78] P:1534.62 E:0.069657 |  will be at Dartford. This is going towards
[8741.78 - 8743.78] P:1669.41 E:0.073432 |  Dartford tunnels. There's a broken down car
[8743.78 - 8745.78] P:1684.75 E:0.064044 |  but holding all traffic to move that
[8745.78 - 8747.78] P:1374.38 E:0.069716 |  hopefully won't be too long before
[8747.78 - 8749.78] P:1851.13 E:0.065276 |  they get all lanes open again but for now
[8749.78 - 8751.78] P:1343.89 E:0.066692 |  traffic is curing. Michelle Dignan

[8769.78 - 8771.78] P:1943.52 E:0.050644 |  Goal is here at Wembley.
[8771.78 - 8773.78] P:2007.85 E:0.067920 |  England 0, Germany 0.
[8773.78 - 8775.78] P:2058.01 E:0.062258 |  So tense for the footballers.
[8775.78 - 8777.78] P:1903.42 E:0.060871 |  Fairly comfortable for the cricketers, Elmer.
[8777.78 - 8779.78] P:1990.69 E:0.056322 |  Absolutely comfortable, Chappers.
[8779.78 - 8781.78] P:1868.15 E:0.075341 |  They've won by five wickets with 91 balls remaining.
[8781.78 - 8783.78] P:1964.84 E:0.070428 |  189 for five.
[8783.78 - 8785.78] P:1624.84 E:0.062299 |  That was the target that they needed.
[8785.78 - 8787.78] P:1980.03 E:0.070740 |  Joe Root finishing 79, not out.
[8787.78 - 8789.78] P:2026.82 E:0.066525 |  Passing 6,000 runs in
[8789.78 - 8791.78] P:1461.60 E:0.068879 |  a one-day internationals during this game
[8791.78 - 8793.78] P:1846.77 E:0.060556 |  and hitting his 34th ODI 50.
[8793.78 - 8795.78] P:1922.59 E:0.063309 |  But Chris Wilkes was the man of the match
[8795.78 - 8797.78] P:1922.75 E:0.071130 |  with his figures of four for 18
[8797.78 - 8799.78] P:1945.54 E:0.055578 |  of ten overs including
[8799.78 - 8801.78] P:1962.81 E:0.059976 |  five maidens, just excellent
[8801.78 - 8803.78] P:1823.06 E:0.054540 |  bowling by him.
[8803.78 - 8805.78] P:1561.62 E:0.078265 |  And if it hadn't been for Mowee and Allie getting
[8805.78 - 8807.78] P:2005.03 E:0.057993 |  dropped first ball by Cusel
[8807.78 - 8809.78] P:1807.41 E:0.059164 |  Pereira behind the stumps it might have looked
[8809.78 - 8811.78] P:1915.08 E:0.053990 |  quite different but he finished 28
[8811.78 - 8813.78] P:1769.53 E:0.067231 |  not out, put on 91.
[8813.78 - 8815.78] P:1875.18 E:0.060597 |  Sorry, he was out for 28 in the end, putting on
[8815.78 - 8817.78] P:1725.35 E:0.071198 |  91 with Joe Root. But yeah, England
[8817.78 - 8819.78] P:1878.30 E:0.072481 |  are one-nil up in the ODI series
[8819.78 - 8821.78] P:1726.50 E:0.067236 |  and it's the oval next on Thursday
[8821.78 - 8823.78] P:1853.02 E:0.052789 |  and following that Bristol on Sunday
[8823.78 - 8825.78] P:1506.57 E:0.075267 |  and everyone in a very good mood
[8825.78 - 8827.78] P:1535.50 E:0.061048 |  and apparently the England players were so comfortable
[8827.78 - 8829.78] P:1906.74 E:0.053514 |  that they were all disappearing off to the back of the dressing room
[8829.78 - 8831.78] P:1861.57 E:0.063636 |  to watch the football towards the end of the inning
[8831.78 - 8833.78] P:1742.23 E:0.071264 |  so they didn't see Joe Root's magnificent
[8833.78 - 8835.78] P:1807.32 E:0.052519 |  79 not out.
[8835.78 - 8837.78] P:2032.80 E:0.064805 |  Thank you very much, Alan
[8837.78 - 8839.78] P:2119.28 E:0.063486 |  and because of the early finish to the cricket
[8839.78 - 8841.78] P:1840.54 E:0.065030 |  it means Wimbledon is now
[8841.78 - 8843.78] P:2045.12 E:0.057302 |  on Sports Extra. Jonathan Overend
[8843.78 - 8845.78] P:1761.35 E:0.045586 |  is there. And on centre court
[8845.78 - 8847.78] P:1776.10 E:0.063812 |  at the moment we have France, Switzerland
[8847.78 - 8849.78] P:1685.94 E:0.070854 |  the rematch. It's Adrian Manorino
[8849.78 - 8851.78] P:1559.38 E:0.075108 |  who's taking on Roger Federer
[8851.78 - 8853.78] P:1835.80 E:0.054740 |  the 20-time Grand Slam champion
[8853.78 - 8855.78] P:1642.41 E:0.059966 |  and it's level at one set all
[8855.78 - 8857.78] P:1661.99 E:0.065528 |  and Federer has had some big difficulties
[8857.78 - 8859.78] P:1817.34 E:0.053319 |  with the Frenchman, particularly
[8859.78 - 8861.78] P:1880.42 E:0.060368 |  in the second set which went to a tie break
[8861.78 - 8863.78] P:1931.10 E:0.058336 |  and Federer scuffed his way through it.
[8863.78 - 8865.78] P:1703.79 E:0.060605 |  Manorino the better player, won it on the tie break
[8865.78 - 8867.78] P:1611.93 E:0.057380 |  7 points to 2 and actually
[8867.78 - 8869.78] P:1706.29 E:0.069222 |  the underdog went a break up in this third set
[8869.78 - 8871.78] P:1859.24 E:0.065409 |  as well, 2-love before Federer
[8871.78 - 8873.78] P:1840.78 E:0.048919 |  pegged him back. So at the moment
[8873.78 - 8875.78] P:1878.78 E:0.062603 |  it's two games all third set
[8875.78 - 8877.78] P:1822.00 E:0.051739 |  one set all while on court number one
[8877.78 - 8879.78] P:1507.82 E:0.061527 |  Daniel Medvedev who's the second seed here
[8879.78 - 8881.78] P:1922.53 E:0.055633 |  leads Jan Lennart Strouf by five games
[8881.78 - 8883.78] P:1887.34 E:0.043937 |  to three in the first set.
[8883.78 - 8885.78] P:2061.34 E:0.042030 |  One other sports line for you
[8885.78 - 8887.78] P:2118.88 E:0.070066 |  Mark Cavendish has won his first stage
[8887.78 - 8889.78] P:2042.38 E:0.070584 |  at the Tour de France for five years
[8889.78 - 8891.78] P:2067.38 E:0.040700 |  in a thrilling sprint finish
[8891.78 - 8893.78] P:2093.31 E:0.061117 |  on stage four in
[8893.78 - 8895.78] P:2068.51 E:0.059512 |  Fougere. If you just look at the
[8895.78 - 8897.78] P:1973.27 E:0.065747 |  halftime stats here they're very
[8897.78 - 8899.78] P:2057.29 E:0.062104 |  very similar. 53%
[8899.78 - 8901.78] P:1914.16 E:0.054586 |  possession
[8901.78 - 8903.78] P:2071.93 E:0.066856 |  to England, 47%
[8903.78 - 8905.78] P:1999.53 E:0.048165 |  to Germany.
[8905.78 - 8907.78] P:2047.39 E:0.064184 |  Two shots on target each, three
[8907.78 - 8909.78] P:2009.18 E:0.059788 |  shots in total
[8909.78 - 8911.78] P:1940.16 E:0.054199 |  each they've covered roughly the same
[8911.78 - 8913.78] P:1986.64 E:0.071179 |  amount of distance as well
[8913.78 - 8915.78] P:1855.76 E:0.043996 |  Chris Waddle, Micah Richards
[8915.78 - 8917.78] P:1921.41 E:0.065738 |  and Karen Carney
[8917.78 - 8919.78] P:1923.29 E:0.060105 |  are with us
[8919.78 - 8921.78] P:1894.49 E:0.065905 |  John Murray is also here
[8921.78 - 8923.78] P:1894.49 E:0.063471 |  can you just tell Chris to put his headphones on so he can
[8923.78 - 8925.78] P:1934.53 E:0.040409 |  hear him a question
[8925.78 - 8927.78] P:1985.11 E:0.046257 |  in your in your own time
[8927.78 - 8929.78] P:1931.68 E:0.064534 |  Chris are you alright? Yeah I was just
[8929.78 - 8931.78] P:1974.92 E:0.058619 |  looking at the stats. No I was
[8931.78 - 8933.78] P:1879.68 E:0.081964 |  talking about the stats actually on air
[8933.78 - 8935.78] P:1879.42 E:0.073551 |  but you're taking your headphones off
[8935.78 - 8937.78] P:1944.80 E:0.067935 |  they're very similar aren't they?
[8937.78 - 8939.78] P:1836.36 E:0.061404 |  I'm mainly reading aren't I?
[8939.78 - 8941.78] P:1713.29 E:0.069506 |  I'm mainly reading aren't I?
[8941.78 - 8943.78] P:1930.69 E:0.067496 |  Rio Ferdinand
[8943.78 - 8945.78] P:1966.86 E:0.076076 |  Rio Ferdinand, well do you know what
[8945.78 - 8947.78] P:1899.09 E:0.067059 |  which two players has Rio Ferdinand
[8947.78 - 8949.78] P:1837.51 E:0.068847 |  talked about from an English perspective
[8949.78 - 8951.78] P:1962.47 E:0.047962 |  on television?
[8951.78 - 8953.78] P:1955.66 E:0.066520 |  Well he's talking about midfield players
[8953.78 - 8955.78] P:1907.63 E:0.059085 |  I'm trying to
[8955.78 - 8957.78] P:1862.78 E:0.076498 |  send these thoughts
[8957.78 - 8959.78] P:1930.47 E:0.059696 |  to you. It's that
[8959.78 - 8961.78] P:1969.70 E:0.060185 |  perspective shield. Can it see
[8961.78 - 8963.78] P:1869.26 E:0.077996 |  in between you? Ah you see that
[8963.78 - 8965.78] P:1925.13 E:0.073563 |  perspective shield between me and Chris
[8965.78 - 8967.78] P:1874.38 E:0.062391 |  I'm trying to send it. Transmitting my thoughts.
[8967.78 - 8969.78] P:1889.49 E:0.071890 |  He's talking about Stirling and Sackers
[8969.78 - 8971.78] P:1805.49 E:0.065936 |  they've both been bright for England
[8971.78 - 8973.78] P:1863.17 E:0.066275 |  at different stages of the game
[8973.78 - 8975.78] P:1710.86 E:0.070089 |  and they need to get more from them in the second
[8975.78 - 8977.78] P:1811.66 E:0.045704 |  half.
[8977.78 - 8979.78] P:1689.37 E:0.070236 |  They've had enough ball but if you look at the end product
[8979.78 - 8981.78] P:2071.80 E:0.071783 |  probably Ryan Stirling's had that shot
[8981.78 - 8983.78] P:1848.27 E:0.063839 |  had that run positive we already
[8983.78 - 8985.78] P:2076.38 E:0.058418 |  came nearly capitalised on.
[8985.78 - 8987.78] P:1865.97 E:0.070717 |  Sackers for me started very well
[8987.78 - 8989.78] P:2107.48 E:0.057265 |  and then drifted out the game.
[8989.78 - 8991.78] P:1944.55 E:0.071459 |  He's gone out the game in the last 20 minutes
[8991.78 - 8993.78] P:1859.31 E:0.063158 |  he's not really, nothing's coming off for him
[8993.78 - 8995.78] P:1945.28 E:0.069352 |  he's lost the ball he's had a bit of good fortune
[8995.78 - 8997.78] P:1907.70 E:0.054388 |  with a few challenges
[8997.78 - 8999.78] P:1631.54 E:0.052363 |  but England have come into the game
[8999.78 - 9001.78] P:1941.11 E:0.063691 |  and that's the main thing because the first
[9001.78 - 9003.78] P:1900.77 E:0.065606 |  10 minutes I thought
[9003.78 - 9005.78] P:1925.29 E:0.062231 |  well, if Germany score
[9005.78 - 9007.78] P:2079.79 E:0.063339 |  it could lead them all. How long
[9007.78 - 9009.78] P:2118.01 E:0.072678 |  would you wait for the changes then?
[9009.78 - 9011.78] P:2084.57 E:0.062608 |  I'd give it 15 minutes
[9011.78 - 9013.78] P:1811.55 E:0.076122 |  and if you're concerned as well about
[9013.78 - 9015.78] P:1870.86 E:0.063546 |  racing Phillips on yellows
[9015.78 - 9017.78] P:1912.20 E:0.058664 |  it'd be very concerned about that
[9017.78 - 9019.78] P:1882.84 E:0.075777 |  me and John were just talking and he thinks
[9019.78 - 9021.78] P:1889.48 E:0.061892 |  maybe Henderson may come on for one of them
[9021.78 - 9023.78] P:1860.40 E:0.067510 |  it'd be very, very looking
[9023.78 - 9025.78] P:1976.83 E:0.065243 |  because they like to commit, they like to tackle
[9025.78 - 9027.78] P:1776.22 E:0.060065 |  so you'd have to keep an eye on that.
[9027.78 - 9029.78] P:1984.24 E:0.064877 |  You could, and I go back to the point
[9029.78 - 9031.78] P:1672.58 E:0.070318 |  we discussed pretty much Karen Carney
[9031.78 - 9033.78] P:1724.44 E:0.066311 |  you could play Sackers as that
[9033.78 - 9035.78] P:1695.16 E:0.070850 |  win back because he would be
[9035.78 - 9037.78] P:1708.81 E:0.068239 |  he would be higher up then wouldn't he
[9037.78 - 9039.78] P:1766.59 E:0.074873 |  as in the win back position would be higher up.
[9039.78 - 9041.78] P:1716.34 E:0.071078 |  Yeah, no I like that idea
[9041.78 - 9043.78] P:1774.91 E:0.065163 |  I really do, I think that's where we've got to get
[9043.78 - 9045.78] P:1898.39 E:0.060431 |  more joy down those flanks
[9045.78 - 9047.78] P:1832.52 E:0.069010 |  and overloads down the sides
[9047.78 - 9049.78] P:1883.52 E:0.063172 |  and really try and get crosses into the give-all
[9049.78 - 9051.78] P:1735.98 E:0.065661 |  support to Harry Kane, I haven't seen enough of him

[9055.78 - 9057.78] P:1742.51 E:0.065868 |  as soon as we see the goal
[9057.78 - 9059.78] P:1813.24 E:0.066866 |  take the shot at the early opportunity

[9079.78 - 9081.78] P:1907.87 E:0.081270 |  as far as England
[9081.78 - 9083.78] P:1858.98 E:0.070030 |  Alkonsen and John Murray
[9083.78 - 9085.78] P:1813.11 E:0.074627 |  doesn't look like the Germans
[9085.78 - 9087.78] P:1828.74 E:0.071539 |  have made any changes either
[9087.78 - 9089.78] P:1809.81 E:0.060636 |  have they?
[9089.78 - 9091.78] P:1901.14 E:0.067297 |  Can't see any out there
[9091.78 - 9093.78] P:1748.75 E:0.067717 |  so the teams will be as they started
[9093.78 - 9095.78] P:1714.88 E:0.073386 |  unless we're missing something
[9095.78 - 9097.78] P:1800.68 E:0.071732 |  actually Rudiger has just appeared now
[9097.78 - 9099.78] P:1657.46 E:0.069886 |  and is running out onto the field to take his position
[9099.78 - 9101.78] P:1794.93 E:0.070441 |  a little slap of the hands
[9101.78 - 9103.78] P:1736.14 E:0.066440 |  with Hummels who made that important
[9103.78 - 9105.78] P:1671.30 E:0.070263 |  last-ditch challenge
[9105.78 - 9107.78] P:1780.26 E:0.074860 |  see Kyle Walker just down to our left
[9107.78 - 9109.78] P:1836.68 E:0.074788 |  here is trying to raise the fans
[9109.78 - 9111.78] P:1782.39 E:0.076214 |  he's come across, he's applauding them
[9111.78 - 9113.78] P:1745.06 E:0.070381 |  they're on their feet, applauding back
[9113.78 - 9115.78] P:1786.87 E:0.073855 |  so the teams
[9115.78 - 9117.78] P:1670.47 E:0.067417 |  as they started the match, Pickfed and Goal
[9117.78 - 9119.78] P:1751.49 E:0.074476 |  Walker, Stones, McGuire
[9119.78 - 9121.78] P:1691.87 E:0.073489 |  in this 343 for England

[9137.78 - 9139.78] P:1636.62 E:0.069890 |  and had the big chance of the match
[9139.78 - 9141.78] P:1704.90 E:0.073681 |  so far that Jordan Pickfed
[9141.78 - 9143.78] P:1725.70 E:0.070163 |  kept out. England are playing from left
[9143.78 - 9145.78] P:1741.72 E:0.068592 |  to right so go Chris Waddle
[9145.78 - 9147.78] P:1838.00 E:0.075141 |  alongside me in the commentary positions
[9147.78 - 9149.78] P:1741.29 E:0.074396 |  behind the Perspex shields
[9149.78 - 9151.78] P:1539.52 E:0.080079 |  and Karankani is down
[9151.78 - 9153.78] P:1805.84 E:0.076838 |  on pitchside behind the goal that England
[9153.78 - 9155.78] P:1699.08 E:0.076855 |  are attacking as they like to do in the second half
[9155.78 - 9157.78] P:1523.26 E:0.075322 |  which is from left to right
[9157.78 - 9159.78] P:1507.89 E:0.075682 |  as we look
[9159.78 - 9161.78] P:1654.05 E:0.074626 |  these Perspex shields are up there
[9161.78 - 9163.78] P:1554.29 E:0.074829 |  for Covid reasons
[9163.78 - 9165.78] P:1607.27 E:0.073555 |  so that the commentators don't spray
[9165.78 - 9167.78] P:1523.99 E:0.071080 |  over whoever happens to be anywhere
[9167.78 - 9169.78] P:1769.81 E:0.067555 |  in front
[9169.78 - 9171.78] P:1699.44 E:0.077042 |  but it does feel
[9171.78 - 9173.78] P:1762.03 E:0.071115 |  Chris as though we're in a
[9173.78 - 9175.78] P:1780.51 E:0.072396 |  Perspex case of emotion
[9175.78 - 9177.78] P:1687.74 E:0.073706 |  watching England, Germany in the Euros
[9177.78 - 9179.78] P:1767.42 E:0.074746 |  as it's played to Saka down the right
[9179.78 - 9181.78] P:1642.22 E:0.065441 |  but he can't reach that and it's behind for a goal kick
[9181.78 - 9183.78] P:1758.41 E:0.065334 |  how do you think this 343 has worked?
[9183.78 - 9185.78] P:1699.67 E:0.066259 |  I don't think the wing backs are suited
[9185.78 - 9187.78] P:1689.84 E:0.067940 |  no, I don't think the wing backs have enjoyed playing
[9187.78 - 9189.78] P:1624.62 E:0.069816 |  his wing backs, I think the full backs
[9189.78 - 9191.78] P:1748.85 E:0.063933 |  I don't think the wing backs
[9191.78 - 9193.78] P:1764.24 E:0.075498 |  I think James is a wing back
[9193.78 - 9195.78] P:1743.24 E:0.061207 |  better wing back
[9195.78 - 9197.78] P:1840.29 E:0.077113 |  and there's another front three again
[9197.78 - 9199.78] P:1783.79 E:0.059167 |  Stirling's been probably the best
[9199.78 - 9201.78] P:1781.86 E:0.068181 |  of the three
[9201.78 - 9203.78] P:1756.28 E:0.064799 |  but I'd be looking to think give it 20
[9203.78 - 9205.78] P:1746.46 E:0.061468 |  Grealish on one side
[9205.78 - 9207.78] P:1694.96 E:0.065482 |  and Sancho who plays in the Bundesliga
[9207.78 - 9209.78] P:1694.13 E:0.063600 |  Bellingham as well
[9209.78 - 9211.78] P:1701.15 E:0.086410 |  who is 18 today incidentally
[9211.78 - 9213.78] P:1764.04 E:0.070354 |  Jude Bellingham
[9213.78 - 9215.78] P:1840.34 E:0.076729 |  with the Borussia Dortmund man who are on the bench
[9215.78 - 9217.78] P:1801.01 E:0.069996 |  Mounts on the bench as well
[9217.78 - 9219.78] P:1631.01 E:0.058241 |  Foden on the bench
[9219.78 - 9221.78] P:1684.92 E:0.072192 |  certainly you'd expect would see Foden
[9221.78 - 9223.78] P:1685.35 E:0.067529 |  probably Grealish you would think as well
[9223.78 - 9225.78] P:1760.35 E:0.075940 |  with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George
[9225.78 - 9227.78] P:1695.43 E:0.071760 |  and Micah Richards here, how could Gareth Southgate
[9227.78 - 9229.78] P:1757.69 E:0.065041 |  not bring on Jack Grealish
[9229.78 - 9231.78] P:1615.26 E:0.063375 |  at some stage
[9231.78 - 9233.78] P:1577.52 E:0.071933 |  England with the ball

[9277.78 - 9279.78] P:1740.46 E:0.068785 |  worried about making a mistake
[9279.78 - 9281.78] P:1817.31 E:0.068477 |  Habits now receives it on that right flank
[9283.78 - 9285.78] P:1612.59 E:0.069570 |  He uses Joshua Kimmich
[9285.78 - 9287.78] P:1734.26 E:0.079759 |  who is out there
[9287.78 - 9289.78] P:1740.67 E:0.077222 |  Kroos now drives it towards the edge of the box

[9297.78 - 9299.78] P:1949.66 E:0.076843 |  Phillips might have got a shove Habits with a shot
[9299.78 - 9301.78] P:1766.15 E:0.077748 |  and it's saved by Pickford
[9301.78 - 9303.78] P:1825.98 E:0.076221 |  who threw up the left arm and pushed it over the top
[9303.78 - 9305.78] P:1797.52 E:0.079212 |  Good save

[9309.78 - 9311.78] P:1582.06 E:0.071579 |  What a strike
[9311.78 - 9313.78] P:1637.92 E:0.075490 |  Straight out of the body
[9313.78 - 9315.78] P:1729.87 E:0.067049 |  Riax tips it over the crossbar

[9333.78 - 9335.78] P:1858.48 E:0.064445 |  and then cleared away
[9335.78 - 9337.78] P:1751.83 E:0.060909 |  Just took a touch off the head of
[9337.78 - 9339.78] P:1707.95 E:0.073806 |  Goretzka
[9339.78 - 9341.78] P:1756.24 E:0.075184 |  I think it was at the near post who got to it first
[9341.78 - 9343.78] P:1697.36 E:0.073434 |  but England were able to clear away
[9343.78 - 9345.78] P:1607.62 E:0.064236 |  Just a little glance on that
[9345.78 - 9347.78] P:1717.60 E:0.077636 |  and Germany played all the way back to Neuer
[9347.78 - 9349.78] P:1710.64 E:0.079419 |  It's a good corner, if you watch Germany
[9349.78 - 9351.78] P:1714.86 E:0.068538 |  they've been doing it for years
[9351.78 - 9353.78] P:1781.30 E:0.073144 |  On the lane with the first post

[9395.78 - 9397.78] P:1670.12 E:0.070283 |  now this is his 76th cap
[9397.78 - 9399.78] P:1644.42 E:0.076701 |  like Muller of course
[9399.78 - 9401.78] P:1761.64 E:0.067069 |  you'll remember that Jürgen Lerf decided
[9401.78 - 9403.78] P:1871.39 E:0.065657 |  that he didn't need
[9403.78 - 9405.78] P:1795.80 E:0.076186 |  Muller and Hummels and indeed

[9407.78 - 9409.78] P:1840.11 E:0.074042 |  but such were their struggles over the course

[9411.78 - 9413.78] P:1801.67 E:0.068085 |  and Muller at least
[9413.78 - 9415.78] P:1789.07 E:0.062607 |  but that's
[9415.78 - 9417.78] P:1704.88 E:0.074860 |  out of play on the halfway line

[9423.78 - 9425.78] P:1670.90 E:0.066468 |  to take, still waiting for the first big

[9437.78 - 9439.78] P:1760.30 E:0.073531 |  on this Tuesday afternoon stroke evening
[9439.78 - 9441.78] P:1706.79 E:0.064095 |  ball played by England
[9441.78 - 9443.78] P:1677.12 E:0.069893 |  to Trippier, Trippier on the right

[9445.78 - 9447.78] P:1788.67 E:0.071598 |  other lap but Riddical will get there first
[9447.78 - 9449.78] P:1854.49 E:0.076159 |  and Todi Riddical just lifts it into the crowd
[9449.78 - 9451.78] P:1743.91 E:0.079304 |  down in front of us
[9451.78 - 9453.78] P:1723.13 E:0.078801 |  when they switch to playing there is a lot of space
[9453.78 - 9455.78] P:1779.76 E:0.078188 |  for the two wing backs but they don't seem
[9455.78 - 9457.78] P:1768.24 E:0.076656 |  to want to step in and have the ball and enjoy it
[9457.78 - 9459.78] P:1839.97 E:0.075350 |  and go and try and get a cross in
[9459.78 - 9461.78] P:1715.04 E:0.078731 |  or come and say and have a shot
[9461.78 - 9463.78] P:1616.04 E:0.066257 |  they're reluctant to go forward
[9463.78 - 9465.78] P:1773.17 E:0.068582 |  Walker with the thrill
[9465.78 - 9467.78] P:1702.05 E:0.073923 |  Harry Maguire just trots into the penalty
[9467.78 - 9469.78] P:1704.42 E:0.067552 |  and puts himself in a position near the edge
[9469.78 - 9471.78] P:1785.80 E:0.062416 |  of the box, Walker
[9471.78 - 9473.78] P:1647.18 E:0.074595 |  spins the ball, basketball style in one
[9473.78 - 9475.78] P:1701.92 E:0.064879 |  hand, run up, he has the
[9475.78 - 9477.78] P:1638.97 E:0.073238 |  throw looking for Maguire, it's over the top
[9477.78 - 9479.78] P:1659.73 E:0.068234 |  of Maguire and it's headed away by Hummels
[9479.78 - 9481.78] P:1689.16 E:0.069600 |  who is behind him, Germany looked to break
[9481.78 - 9483.78] P:1841.51 E:0.070976 |  Verna, chesting it back to his club mate Havertz
[9483.78 - 9485.78] P:1846.87 E:0.075305 |  good challenge though from Trippier
[9485.78 - 9487.78] P:1779.93 E:0.066330 |  stopped, Havertz in his tracks
[9487.78 - 9489.78] P:1728.86 E:0.069777 |  Rice works it to the left hand side
[9489.78 - 9491.78] P:1700.16 E:0.072082 |  Sterling is there on the left wing, Sterling
[9491.78 - 9493.78] P:1784.06 E:0.069220 |  running at Kimmich then comes inside
[9493.78 - 9495.78] P:1766.34 E:0.066760 |  still running at Kimmich again, Kimmich
[9495.78 - 9497.78] P:1809.18 E:0.073347 |  is there, Sterling into the box
[9497.78 - 9499.78] P:1831.85 E:0.076004 |  Sterling still going but it's very congested
[9499.78 - 9501.78] P:1884.69 E:0.078740 |  throws with a clearance, Sterling threw himself down
[9501.78 - 9503.78] P:1755.70 E:0.067301 |  challenge came in
[9503.78 - 9505.78] P:1779.24 E:0.081178 |  from Ginter, Sterling just put his foot
[9505.78 - 9507.78] P:1744.20 E:0.078838 |  into Ginter and went to ground
[9507.78 - 9509.78] P:1768.25 E:0.075504 |  referee wasn't having that
[9509.78 - 9511.78] P:1827.55 E:0.078835 |  and now listen to this noise inside Wembley Stadium
[9511.78 - 9513.78] P:1618.53 E:0.066251 |  as the
[9513.78 - 9515.78] P:1728.57 E:0.074701 |  England fans feel that their team needs
[9515.78 - 9517.78] P:1559.35 E:0.071898 |  their help
[9517.78 - 9519.78] P:1607.82 E:0.074181 |  and they've never been able to help them in these
[9519.78 - 9521.78] P:1632.10 E:0.066369 |  kind of numbers
[9521.78 - 9523.78] P:1611.82 E:0.069550 |  since the pandemic began here at Wembley
[9523.78 - 9525.78] P:1705.45 E:0.079103 |  Ball played into the penalty area but Sterling's
[9525.78 - 9527.78] P:1768.80 E:0.070407 |  run is blocked and indeed he's picked up
[9527.78 - 9529.78] P:1765.29 E:0.069196 |  for a foul on Ginter and it's
[9529.78 - 9531.78] P:1763.45 E:0.069001 |  a free kick to the Germans
[9531.78 - 9533.78] P:1824.62 E:0.072663 |  which is taken quickly, Karin Karni, pitch site
[9533.78 - 9535.78] P:1678.17 E:0.066892 |  He's got to shoot Raheem Sterling
[9535.78 - 9537.78] P:1740.81 E:0.069258 |  does everything, his feet
[9537.78 - 9539.78] P:1681.22 E:0.071817 |  move and a little double step over
[9539.78 - 9541.78] P:1701.93 E:0.070681 |  take the shot, you're near to the 18
[9541.78 - 9543.78] P:1618.67 E:0.070820 |  don't pass it in at this moment
[9543.78 - 9545.78] P:1751.87 E:0.071823 |  he's got to shoot at the confidence
[9545.78 - 9547.78] P:1772.07 E:0.072221 |  he's in form, take the shot
[9549.78 - 9551.78] P:1763.02 E:0.073442 |  England nail, Germany
[9551.78 - 9553.78] P:1837.67 E:0.072209 |  goal, Chris Waddle up here
[9553.78 - 9555.78] P:1783.26 E:0.063198 |  beside me, Chris if you
[9555.78 - 9557.78] P:1803.44 E:0.073348 |  have you got any sort of good feeling
[9557.78 - 9559.78] P:1693.91 E:0.065709 |  at the moment, one way or the other
[9559.78 - 9561.78] P:1617.71 E:0.071429 |  it will definitely not go 90 minutes
[9561.78 - 9563.78] P:1697.04 E:0.081057 |  I know that
[9563.78 - 9565.78] P:1860.05 E:0.074334 |  it will go 90 minutes
[9565.78 - 9567.78] P:1725.12 E:0.076828 |  it's somebody who will score
[9567.78 - 9569.78] P:1744.75 E:0.073104 |  somebody who will score
[9569.78 - 9571.78] P:1864.58 E:0.077020 |  so you think we're going to have a result
[9571.78 - 9573.78] P:1737.11 E:0.074865 |  inside 90, no penalties
[9573.78 - 9575.78] P:1773.14 E:0.079638 |  here's Hunnows
[9575.78 - 9577.78] P:1694.44 E:0.070602 |  Karetska
[9577.78 - 9579.78] P:1755.07 E:0.070612 |  drops deep
[9579.78 - 9581.78] P:1773.35 E:0.080573 |  three Lions being sung
[9583.78 - 9585.78] P:1572.13 E:0.072223 |  and what a noise
[9585.78 - 9587.78] P:1618.94 E:0.077917 |  Havertz now on the right
[9587.78 - 9589.78] P:1658.57 E:0.075138 |  for Germany, all in black
[9589.78 - 9591.78] P:1576.18 E:0.065113 |  moving it
[9591.78 - 9593.78] P:1742.25 E:0.079099 |  and then back towards Karetska
[9593.78 - 9595.78] P:1795.71 E:0.074006 |  Karetska in the golden boots
[9595.78 - 9597.78] P:1877.27 E:0.073706 |  Balls played out by Kroos
[9597.78 - 9599.78] P:1772.49 E:0.076788 |  to the right hand side
[9599.78 - 9601.78] P:1809.28 E:0.072423 |  Kimmich is there, dangerous cross from Kimmich
[9601.78 - 9603.78] P:1870.35 E:0.076039 |  it's headed up in the air
[9603.78 - 9605.78] P:1884.11 E:0.072812 |  Pickford Gums gets a punch on it
[9605.78 - 9607.78] P:1782.56 E:0.073821 |  and then England are able to clear
[9607.78 - 9609.78] P:1783.83 E:0.074792 |  on the edge of the penalty area
[9609.78 - 9611.78] P:1835.03 E:0.083171 |  Gorsons was in there again
[9611.78 - 9613.78] P:1689.26 E:0.076279 |  the German left wing back but could only
[9613.78 - 9615.78] P:1791.89 E:0.075935 |  head straight up in the air and Pickford was able to clear
[9615.78 - 9617.78] P:1801.68 E:0.074173 |  Kane's gone down in the centre circle
[9617.78 - 9619.78] P:1773.62 E:0.073543 |  Germany still in possession
[9619.78 - 9621.78] P:1782.21 E:0.073058 |  Kane's still sitting on the ground
[9623.78 - 9625.78] P:1882.86 E:0.070165 |  Havertz
[9625.78 - 9627.78] P:1807.07 E:0.082151 |  still Kane getting to his feet
[9627.78 - 9629.78] P:1845.29 E:0.069595 |  he's on one knee, Havertz down the right
[9629.78 - 9631.78] P:1846.37 E:0.080964 |  In comes the challenge, good one as well from Sterling
[9631.78 - 9633.78] P:1825.40 E:0.077547 |  and Sterling plays it up to Kane
[9633.78 - 9635.78] P:1827.23 E:0.078897 |  but Kane's in trouble
[9635.78 - 9637.78] P:1788.46 E:0.074977 |  Kane's now back on his back
[9637.78 - 9639.78] P:1734.32 E:0.080595 |  and Germany put the ball out of play
[9639.78 - 9641.78] P:1808.61 E:0.073651 |  and he's on his right knee
[9641.78 - 9643.78] P:1743.77 E:0.082336 |  I didn't really see a lot between
[9643.78 - 9645.78] P:1798.48 E:0.076186 |  between him and Hummels
[9645.78 - 9647.78] P:1723.70 E:0.078783 |  but I don't know if he's jaded or he's fell awkwardly
[9647.78 - 9649.78] P:1814.50 E:0.071985 |  he's backs in
[9649.78 - 9651.78] P:1744.66 E:0.070722 |  so Hummels who heads it
[9651.78 - 9653.78] P:1757.26 E:0.076849 |  I think it's just a clash of knees
[9653.78 - 9655.78] P:1780.70 E:0.080150 |  I think it's just a clash of knees
[9655.78 - 9657.78] P:1687.35 E:0.068192 |  so it should be OK
[9657.78 - 9659.78] P:1585.65 E:0.082306 |  Harry Kane still not scored at the Euros
[9659.78 - 9661.78] P:1777.02 E:0.071026 |  Will Cook top scorer in Russia
[9661.78 - 9663.78] P:1647.95 E:0.073417 |  he's sitting on there
[9663.78 - 9665.78] P:1553.10 E:0.072152 |  on the pitch
[9665.78 - 9667.78] P:1652.71 E:0.074822 |  with his hands out behind him
[9667.78 - 9669.78] P:1660.59 E:0.070061 |  and
[9669.78 - 9671.78] P:1683.41 E:0.074744 |  down on pitch side Karen
[9671.78 - 9673.78] P:1675.46 E:0.077800 |  what have you seen
[9673.78 - 9675.78] P:1635.04 E:0.074624 |  Yeah, they're making a serve Marcus Rashford
[9675.78 - 9677.78] P:1645.54 E:0.071261 |  he's coming on, the stretcher's on the side
[9677.78 - 9679.78] P:1615.11 E:0.072036 |  but they've already signalled to make a serve
[9679.78 - 9681.78] P:1622.39 E:0.066401 |  Steve Holland, Gareth Southgate's assistant
[9681.78 - 9683.78] P:1539.92 E:0.066425 |  Kane straight down
[9683.78 - 9685.78] P:1578.28 E:0.074601 |  pulled Marcus Rashford over, they're talking to him now
[9685.78 - 9687.78] P:1705.81 E:0.069584 |  but for me it looks like he's going to be coming on
[9687.78 - 9689.78] P:1543.23 E:0.070908 |  it might not be now though
[9689.78 - 9691.78] P:1603.59 E:0.067654 |  but I think it's pretty imminent
[9691.78 - 9693.78] P:1475.16 E:0.067879 |  Right, well Harry Kane gets to his feet
[9693.78 - 9695.78] P:1689.55 E:0.077237 |  and of course this is highly significant
[9695.78 - 9697.78] P:1660.75 E:0.070950 |  if Kane's not, look he's back on his feet
[9697.78 - 9699.78] P:1680.67 E:0.069930 |  and
[9699.78 - 9701.78] P:1628.16 E:0.076593 |  and Harry Kane is walking out towards the far side
[9701.78 - 9703.78] P:1653.49 E:0.076781 |  I can see Rashford now as Karen mentioned
[9703.78 - 9705.78] P:1718.14 E:0.071290 |  and it is quite a vigorous warm-up exercise
[9705.78 - 9707.78] P:1698.48 E:0.080288 |  that he's going through
[9707.78 - 9709.78] P:1668.52 E:0.073111 |  Harry Kane
[9709.78 - 9711.78] P:1653.01 E:0.069819 |  if you're wrong Chris
[9711.78 - 9713.78] P:1805.81 E:0.080767 |  and it goes to penalties
[9713.78 - 9715.78] P:1766.57 E:0.069759 |  you want Harry Kane to be taking one of them
[9715.78 - 9717.78] P:1659.94 E:0.078366 |  Well exactly, it looks alright listen he's got a little bit of a limp there
[9717.78 - 9719.78] P:1665.25 E:0.075619 |  but I'm sure he's not going to come off
[9719.78 - 9721.78] P:1823.23 E:0.071601 |  No he's okay
[9721.78 - 9723.78] P:1692.19 E:0.070573 |  as you said it's just the knees
[9723.78 - 9725.78] P:1679.89 E:0.071902 |  knocked together and anyone who's done that
[9725.78 - 9727.78] P:1661.29 E:0.064760 |  will know how sore that can be
[9727.78 - 9729.78] P:1715.51 E:0.066857 |  Free kick

[9731.78 - 9733.78] P:1529.82 E:0.075679 |  he's just running his hands through his blonde hair
[9733.78 - 9735.78] P:1595.94 E:0.064677 |  over there on the far side
[9735.78 - 9737.78] P:1615.33 E:0.071405 |  throwing taken by England and they will give possession back
[9737.78 - 9739.78] P:1620.20 E:0.071600 |  to Germany but it does look like it'll be Rashford
[9739.78 - 9741.78] P:1737.03 E:0.069662 |  who is going to come on
[9741.78 - 9743.78] P:1745.55 E:0.076063 |  he's running down towards that end where Karen is
[9743.78 - 9745.78] P:1752.87 E:0.071079 |  England nail, Germany nail
[9745.78 - 9747.78] P:1742.10 E:0.075503 |  BBC Radio 5 Live already 10 minutes played
[9747.78 - 9749.78] P:1777.34 E:0.066502 |  of the second half here
[9749.78 - 9751.78] P:1857.24 E:0.062110 |  not the goals
[9751.78 - 9753.78] P:1748.79 E:0.075396 |  of yesterday by any means
[9753.78 - 9755.78] P:1734.33 E:0.067901 |  but that was an extraordinary day
[9755.78 - 9757.78] P:1827.31 E:0.078815 |  Harry Maguire, chest of all down in the centre circle
[9757.78 - 9759.78] P:1837.09 E:0.073923 |  there's a buzz
[9759.78 - 9761.78] P:1750.45 E:0.074144 |  of anticipation as he takes it forward
[9761.78 - 9763.78] P:1729.80 E:0.072233 |  but then has to turn
[9763.78 - 9765.78] P:1740.07 E:0.072373 |  and give it back and it's all the way back
[9765.78 - 9767.78] P:1812.59 E:0.065659 |  to Jordan Pickford
[9767.78 - 9769.78] P:1569.86 E:0.075574 |  who's now made a couple of important saves
[9769.78 - 9771.78] P:1707.71 E:0.067337 |  in the match to keep it
[9771.78 - 9773.78] P:1593.30 E:0.069672 |  to preserve England's record
[9773.78 - 9775.78] P:1644.38 E:0.071151 |  of not having conceded a goal yet
[9775.78 - 9777.78] P:1676.84 E:0.060310 |  at this tournament
[9777.78 - 9779.78] P:1725.55 E:0.065910 |  England conceded
[9779.78 - 9781.78] P:1718.31 E:0.072125 |  one goal
[9781.78 - 9783.78] P:1586.47 E:0.070969 |  in their nine matches unbeaten
[9783.78 - 9785.78] P:1668.49 E:0.069045 |  the run that they were on
[9785.78 - 9787.78] P:1600.69 E:0.069817 |  coming into this last 16
[9787.78 - 9789.78] P:1669.54 E:0.070260 |  game here at the Euros
[9789.78 - 9791.78] P:1792.76 E:0.069232 |  Phillips
[9791.78 - 9793.78] P:1741.33 E:0.063239 |  back to Stolz
[9793.78 - 9795.78] P:1714.31 E:0.075524 |  and he works the pass towards Lukeshaugh
[9795.78 - 9797.78] P:1749.41 E:0.078527 |  on the left hand side, Stirling nips in
[9797.78 - 9799.78] P:1813.88 E:0.078967 |  takes it away, pulls through the middle
[9799.78 - 9801.78] P:1821.42 E:0.077743 |  Kane and Stirling exchange
[9801.78 - 9803.78] P:1823.58 E:0.074012 |  Stirling now moving from left to right
[9803.78 - 9805.78] P:1767.83 E:0.074809 |  and the area passed through to get back
[9805.78 - 9807.78] P:1784.10 E:0.066470 |  then the covering challenge came in
[9807.78 - 9809.78] P:1782.36 E:0.078141 |  Muller it was
[9809.78 - 9811.78] P:1906.71 E:0.070196 |  and the Germans played forward towards Havertz
[9811.78 - 9813.78] P:1851.82 E:0.068081 |  and now Havertz running up Maguire
[9813.78 - 9815.78] P:1923.16 E:0.071679 |  plays it square, Werner on the edge of the box
[9815.78 - 9817.78] P:1923.57 E:0.066786 |  Werner taking on Stolz
[9817.78 - 9819.78] P:1898.43 E:0.076245 |  went on the accelerator
[9819.78 - 9821.78] P:1825.48 E:0.075508 |  Jon Stolz against Werner there and got the touch behind
[9821.78 - 9823.78] P:1827.94 E:0.076693 |  for a corner
[9823.78 - 9825.78] P:1919.92 E:0.073959 |  Havertz first touch on the ball coming across the field
[9825.78 - 9827.78] P:1799.89 E:0.075176 |  first touch, takes it on the half volley
[9827.78 - 9829.78] P:1726.18 E:0.068163 |  starts running England back then
[9829.78 - 9831.78] P:1742.05 E:0.075782 |  Werner to me doesn't look confident in front of the goal
[9831.78 - 9833.78] P:1834.60 E:0.066295 |  now he takes a lot of chances to score
[9833.78 - 9835.78] P:1832.81 E:0.075458 |  but Ryan Stirling
[9835.78 - 9837.78] P:1736.69 E:0.068944 |  as was Mikas he's more than me
[9837.78 - 9839.78] P:1872.62 E:0.079718 |  he frustrates so much, he gets in position
[9839.78 - 9841.78] P:1727.09 E:0.072193 |  and you think pass it, shoot
[9841.78 - 9843.78] P:1811.84 E:0.075806 |  do something and he doesn't do anything
[9843.78 - 9845.78] P:1784.07 E:0.069725 |  and loses it
[9845.78 - 9847.78] P:1740.53 E:0.073516 |  corner to Germany from the left
[9847.78 - 9849.78] P:1702.83 E:0.066050 |  it's nil nil, the black and red
[9849.78 - 9851.78] P:1797.02 E:0.073930 |  and gold are being twirled as the balls played in short
[9851.78 - 9853.78] P:1844.65 E:0.068960 |  Kroos has to stretch to get it back
[9853.78 - 9855.78] P:1798.45 E:0.071471 |  and then plays it with the outside of his right boot
[9855.78 - 9857.78] P:1763.22 E:0.069677 |  rather ungainly
[9857.78 - 9859.78] P:1699.29 E:0.072037 |  it was and Kane was easily
[9859.78 - 9861.78] P:1632.94 E:0.067564 |  able to head it back out towards that side
[9861.78 - 9863.78] P:1582.67 E:0.064502 |  the German left and it bounced into the hoardings
[9863.78 - 9865.78] P:1613.41 E:0.073203 |  and the little ball boy
[9865.78 - 9867.78] P:1614.64 E:0.066534 |  was able to pick it up and give it back to the Germans
[9867.78 - 9869.78] P:1748.28 E:0.069057 |  Havertz into the area, Havertz with a flick
[9869.78 - 9871.78] P:1710.15 E:0.070301 |  but Phillips is there and England are able to clear
[9871.78 - 9873.78] P:1772.65 E:0.077342 |  maybe that ball boy will play for England
[9873.78 - 9875.78] P:1600.46 E:0.071562 |  here at Wembley, one day and we'll be
[9875.78 - 9877.78] P:1680.74 E:0.075423 |  talking to him about how he was the
[9877.78 - 9879.78] P:1690.78 E:0.065517 |  the ball boy
[9879.78 - 9881.78] P:1664.17 E:0.077340 |  on that day that England
[9881.78 - 9883.78] P:1590.46 E:0.078060 |  met Germany in 2021
[9883.78 - 9885.78] P:1754.64 E:0.078658 |  still waiting for the opening goal
[9885.78 - 9887.78] P:1816.19 E:0.076862 |  and as we do so it becomes increasingly
[9887.78 - 9889.78] P:1643.57 E:0.073425 |  tense and nervous
[9889.78 - 9891.78] P:1643.24 E:0.074625 |  for everyone watching here
[9891.78 - 9893.78] P:1625.10 E:0.074757 |  underneath the arch
[9893.78 - 9895.78] P:1697.65 E:0.069410 |  of Wembley Stadium
[9895.78 - 9897.78] P:1650.94 E:0.072472 |  Garetska, Garetska now
[9897.78 - 9899.78] P:1453.96 E:0.069577 |  to the
[9899.78 - 9901.78] P:1577.02 E:0.070232 |  far side
[9901.78 - 9903.78] P:1705.61 E:0.079484 |  where Kimmich was able to play it
[9903.78 - 9905.78] P:1695.47 E:0.071264 |  back to Gintyre
[9905.78 - 9907.78] P:1700.23 E:0.077178 |  Kimmich thought about the long pass
[9907.78 - 9909.78] P:1665.25 E:0.074582 |  but it goes square, it's interesting
[9909.78 - 9911.78] P:1698.87 E:0.074471 |  Johnny had Grealish forwarding
[9911.78 - 9913.78] P:1768.46 E:0.067076 |  and Rashford warmed up
[9913.78 - 9915.78] P:1732.62 E:0.076506 |  now he's changed it, it's very midfield to us
[9915.78 - 9917.78] P:1671.84 E:0.070635 |  Havertz back to Kroos
[9917.78 - 9919.78] P:1749.41 E:0.069607 |  just a little touch from him
[9919.78 - 9921.78] P:1669.02 E:0.075627 |  into the centre circle
[9921.78 - 9923.78] P:1719.92 E:0.073850 |  and now
[9923.78 - 9925.78] P:1801.03 E:0.081812 |  Germany are just being very very patient
[9925.78 - 9927.78] P:1726.61 E:0.074664 |  here
[9927.78 - 9929.78] P:1751.40 E:0.081788 |  and England are setting off them, Hummels through the middle
[9929.78 - 9931.78] P:1860.15 E:0.074796 |  the whistles
[9931.78 - 9933.78] P:1871.96 E:0.077382 |  flick towards Werner who flicked it himself
[9933.78 - 9935.78] P:1832.34 E:0.070353 |  but that was blocked
[9935.78 - 9937.78] P:1777.40 E:0.074458 |  and England have got it with Shaw on the left hand side
[9937.78 - 9939.78] P:1676.68 E:0.070292 |  Sterling still ten yards inside his own half
[9939.78 - 9941.78] P:1782.58 E:0.073615 |  Shaw's made the run, Sterling has got to
[9941.78 - 9943.78] P:1715.16 E:0.069338 |  play it all the way back to Maguire
[9943.78 - 9945.78] P:1746.52 E:0.066125 |  who will pass it to Pickford who comes out at pace
[9945.78 - 9947.78] P:1752.81 E:0.066077 |  and left footed
[9947.78 - 9949.78] P:1781.91 E:0.077867 |  lifted up towards Harry Kane who's with Hummels again
[9949.78 - 9951.78] P:1779.21 E:0.079949 |  that's been quite a contest
[9951.78 - 9953.78] P:1809.05 E:0.076280 |  came with a flick and then Saka trying to
[9953.78 - 9955.78] P:1819.88 E:0.075587 |  to reach it but Gintyre putting the challenge
[9955.78 - 9957.78] P:1826.81 E:0.082077 |  that was a good challenge, he's played the ball
[9957.78 - 9959.78] P:1868.53 E:0.077753 |  and unfortunately he's just sort of left his foot there
[9959.78 - 9961.78] P:1862.30 E:0.074788 |  a little bit in court
[9961.78 - 9963.78] P:1837.26 E:0.078084 |  and Riedegar puts the ball out so
[9963.78 - 9965.78] P:1747.33 E:0.073739 |  they can get treatment to Saka
[9965.78 - 9967.78] P:1740.50 E:0.074622 |  this minute and same, you've got to be thinking about changing
[9967.78 - 9969.78] P:1822.14 E:0.062544 |  this front three
[9969.78 - 9971.78] P:1755.08 E:0.076840 |  Riedegar swiped the ball out of play
[9971.78 - 9973.78] P:1792.55 E:0.075957 |  so we've got to stop it in play, so let's bring in Micah
[9973.78 - 9975.78] P:1749.01 E:0.062867 |  Richard just sitting down in front of us
[9975.78 - 9977.78] P:1668.86 E:0.076349 |  to see what you've made
[9977.78 - 9979.78] P:1721.59 E:0.073738 |  of almost the first quarter of an hour
[9979.78 - 9981.78] P:1619.96 E:0.061885 |  of the second half Micah
[9981.78 - 9983.78] P:1471.14 E:0.077484 |  Yeah, it's not being great
[9983.78 - 9985.78] P:1677.75 E:0.072091 |  again England, Pickford
[9985.78 - 9987.78] P:1590.59 E:0.069201 |  we have to give Pickford because
[9987.78 - 9989.78] P:1581.58 E:0.067969 |  he made an excellent save for Werner
[9989.78 - 9991.78] P:1536.95 E:0.072735 |  in the first half and then he's made
[9991.78 - 9993.78] P:1575.42 E:0.071758 |  a great save from Hal Verst
[9993.78 - 9995.78] P:1603.74 E:0.075290 |  in the second half and he just seems to be
[9995.78 - 9997.78] P:1565.95 E:0.070296 |  the shining light
[9997.78 - 9999.78] P:1494.67 E:0.071409 |  in terms of his organisation when the defence
[9999.78 - 10001.78] P:1598.30 E:0.073001 |  is out of position, you can just see him
[10001.78 - 10003.78] P:1673.97 E:0.061116 |  I'm just watching him, he's always talking
[10003.78 - 10005.78] P:1664.20 E:0.064476 |  giving that great influence from the back
[10005.78 - 10007.78] P:1481.55 E:0.065385 |  and he's been a star performer for me today
[10007.78 - 10009.78] P:1867.17 E:0.068147 |  0-0, 5-0 in BBC Sands
[10009.78 - 10011.78] P:1729.65 E:0.063861 |  Noya
[10011.78 - 10013.78] P:1656.58 E:0.072539 |  Saka has received
[10013.78 - 10015.78] P:1868.29 E:0.075841 |  his treatment, he's back on the field
[10015.78 - 10017.78] P:1778.87 E:0.076279 |  Bukaiyo Saka, the Arsenal teenager
[10017.78 - 10019.78] P:1738.18 E:0.075707 |  and then free kick given against
[10019.78 - 10021.78] P:1758.99 E:0.079088 |  given in favour of Haberts near the centre
[10021.78 - 10023.78] P:1733.85 E:0.075567 |  circle, Riedegar
[10023.78 - 10025.78] P:1617.42 E:0.075304 |  It was a little bit late
[10025.78 - 10027.78] P:1709.00 E:0.051593 |  you know
[10027.78 - 10029.78] P:1783.88 E:0.063654 |  Yep, free kick taken, that's all it is
[10029.78 - 10031.78] P:1712.69 E:0.073528 |  in the Germans have it inside their own half
[10031.78 - 10033.78] P:1771.10 E:0.073699 |  The news from down at Wimbledon by the way
[10033.78 - 10035.78] P:1760.21 E:0.068969 |  is that Roger Federer
[10035.78 - 10037.78] P:1736.17 E:0.061789 |  is 2 sets to 1 down
[10037.78 - 10039.78] P:1601.10 E:0.067626 |  against Adrian Manorino

[10053.78 - 10055.78] P:1768.64 E:0.074091 |  and at the moment

[10065.78 - 10067.78] P:1677.86 E:0.076906 |  over towards that far side
[10067.78 - 10069.78] P:1672.48 E:0.074320 |  Shor's still waiting
[10069.78 - 10071.78] P:1695.61 E:0.063299 |  to take the throw
[10071.78 - 10073.78] P:1743.15 E:0.076510 |  but imagine the referee will give him
[10073.78 - 10075.78] P:1639.80 E:0.078720 |  a hurry up in a moment if he hasn't taken it
[10075.78 - 10077.78] P:1589.02 E:0.063504 |  Shor does now take it to Saka
[10077.78 - 10079.78] P:1569.05 E:0.068707 |  and Kane slides in
[10079.78 - 10081.78] P:1739.62 E:0.072247 |  Kane seems okay
[10081.78 - 10083.78] P:1685.56 E:0.071785 |  Phillips, Rice, now to the right
[10083.78 - 10085.78] P:1732.71 E:0.069013 |  hand side, Trippier is there

[10093.78 - 10095.78] P:1642.44 E:0.063700 |  and then Shor nods it back
[10095.78 - 10097.78] P:1630.25 E:0.069894 |  towards the half way line
[10097.78 - 10099.78] P:1739.03 E:0.080550 |  still no immediate sign of anyone getting
[10099.78 - 10101.78] P:1631.27 E:0.072472 |  stripped off on the far side even though
[10101.78 - 10103.78] P:1677.38 E:0.073843 |  the substitutes are still there for both
[10103.78 - 10105.78] P:1679.85 E:0.063252 |  England and Germany incidentally
[10105.78 - 10107.78] P:1692.93 E:0.074504 |  still waiting for the first change by
[10107.78 - 10109.78] P:1519.31 E:0.060598 |  either Gareth Southgate or
[10109.78 - 10111.78] P:1764.16 E:0.066083 |  Joachim Lerff
[10111.78 - 10113.78] P:1792.33 E:0.072922 |  to lose this will be his final match

[10115.78 - 10117.78] P:1598.57 E:0.064631 |  this match number
[10117.78 - 10119.78] P:1713.16 E:0.071187 |  198 for him
[10119.78 - 10121.78] P:1743.17 E:0.067825 |  as the Bundes trainer
[10121.78 - 10123.78] P:1749.66 E:0.067379 |  Kane, slips it to the right
[10123.78 - 10125.78] P:1775.39 E:0.070025 |  hand side to Rice, Saka takes it on
[10125.78 - 10127.78] P:1827.13 E:0.069139 |  Saka's up against Hummels in the full back
[10127.78 - 10129.78] P:1805.27 E:0.070228 |  position, plays it back, Rice on the stretch
[10129.78 - 10131.78] P:1890.47 E:0.071592 |  then Trippier with the cross, Stirling
[10131.78 - 10133.78] P:1768.64 E:0.074191 |  at the back post, oh he had to stretch for it
[10133.78 - 10135.78] P:1796.26 E:0.067125 |  nods it back, Phillips then a little
[10135.78 - 10137.78] P:1706.15 E:0.070840 |  head out of the left hand side but Germany are back in position
[10137.78 - 10139.78] P:1657.51 E:0.067796 |  now, Stirling though, swings in
[10139.78 - 10141.78] P:1800.41 E:0.076542 |  the ball but straight into the clubs of Neuer
[10141.78 - 10143.78] P:1809.36 E:0.075469 |  comfortable catch, I'm sorry you've got to
[10143.78 - 10145.78] P:1822.59 E:0.072603 |  make subs, as I say it's there to win
[10145.78 - 10147.78] P:1695.77 E:0.078320 |  England's dominating, they're playing in the German half
[10147.78 - 10149.78] P:1818.17 E:0.069141 |  Germany look, they do look at the threat
[10149.78 - 10151.78] P:1722.09 E:0.076546 |  on the break, I'm not saying they don't but it's there for
[10151.78 - 10153.78] P:1797.55 E:0.077697 |  England, just the quality in the final
[10153.78 - 10155.78] P:1798.16 E:0.070377 |  third so get Greelish on, get
[10155.78 - 10157.78] P:1796.13 E:0.065653 |  Sancho on the other side
[10157.78 - 10159.78] P:1741.34 E:0.077466 |  Chris Waddle calling for
[10159.78 - 10161.78] P:1651.29 E:0.068271 |  Greelish and Sancho
[10161.78 - 10163.78] P:1710.95 E:0.074914 |  from Gareth Southgate who's standing
[10163.78 - 10165.78] P:1529.78 E:0.072756 |  there with his hand on his hip on the far
[10165.78 - 10167.78] P:1685.86 E:0.069628 |  side, Blacksuit, White shirt, thin
[10167.78 - 10169.78] P:1612.77 E:0.063549 |  black tie
[10169.78 - 10171.78] P:1594.50 E:0.070356 |  Germany with the throw
[10171.78 - 10173.78] P:1674.08 E:0.079305 |  looks a little frustrated actually
[10173.78 - 10175.78] P:1652.99 E:0.070454 |  Gareth Southgate as
[10175.78 - 10177.78] P:1604.19 E:0.068733 |  Germany get the ball down
[10177.78 - 10179.78] P:1600.16 E:0.069376 |  and play it
[10179.78 - 10181.78] P:1643.73 E:0.073338 |  back towards the tall
[10181.78 - 10183.78] P:1616.14 E:0.069329 |  dark-haired Hummels
[10183.78 - 10185.78] P:1755.75 E:0.075037 |  now forward to Rudiger who's going to carry
[10185.78 - 10187.78] P:1735.15 E:0.074834 |  the ball forward but he's over hit that pass
[10187.78 - 10189.78] P:1790.29 E:0.060839 |  through inside left for his
[10189.78 - 10191.78] P:1699.12 E:0.072847 |  Chelsea team mate Havertz and then
[10191.78 - 10193.78] P:1809.19 E:0.066557 |  Walker with the clearings
[10193.78 - 10195.78] P:1828.47 E:0.071385 |  headed forward by Cross
[10195.78 - 10197.78] P:1755.49 E:0.072298 |  Trippier on the edge of the area back to
[10197.78 - 10199.78] P:1763.23 E:0.072163 |  Pickford, Pickford takes a touch and then
[10199.78 - 10201.78] P:1525.67 E:0.076792 |  plays it out towards the left hand side
[10201.78 - 10203.78] P:1707.73 E:0.074938 |  Shaw's not going to reach that, it's way beyond him
[10203.78 - 10205.78] P:1691.31 E:0.070566 |  from the England goalkeeper out of play
[10205.78 - 10207.78] P:1703.09 E:0.075453 |  a little nervous reaction from
[10207.78 - 10209.78] P:1567.32 E:0.074443 |  the supporters inside the stadium
[10209.78 - 10211.78] P:1700.83 E:0.069673 |  Germany with it again
[10211.78 - 10213.78] P:1767.54 E:0.079926 |  and on the big screen
[10213.78 - 10215.78] P:1741.78 E:0.076925 |  at one end of the stadium a shot of
[10215.78 - 10217.78] P:1712.64 E:0.071394 |  Jack Greelish sitting on it
[10217.78 - 10219.78] P:1726.16 E:0.071964 |  on the bench with his hand on his chin
[10219.78 - 10221.78] P:1690.62 E:0.075336 |  so he was on the big screen
[10221.78 - 10223.78] P:1723.37 E:0.070271 |  and you can hear the reaction
[10223.78 - 10225.78] P:1595.86 E:0.068425 |  from the players, the crowd want him
[10225.78 - 10227.78] P:1678.49 E:0.080050 |  Chris Waddles called out for him
[10227.78 - 10229.78] P:1610.25 E:0.074344 |  I think they want subs, I think they want
[10229.78 - 10231.78] P:1725.17 E:0.074873 |  to see people come on, this
[10231.78 - 10233.78] P:1776.08 E:0.079113 |  team's doing alright, they're holding
[10233.78 - 10235.78] P:1702.34 E:0.071082 |  Germany, there's not a lot in it
[10235.78 - 10237.78] P:1714.97 E:0.073177 |  but who's going to make the difference because at the minute
[10237.78 - 10239.78] P:1750.09 E:0.069602 |  you can't see anything happening
[10239.78 - 10241.78] P:1688.03 E:0.077001 |  Prince George probably wants him
[10241.78 - 10243.78] P:1618.20 E:0.069647 |  Prince George probably wants him
[10243.78 - 10245.78] P:1707.63 E:0.074640 |  but not yet
[10245.78 - 10247.78] P:1557.72 E:0.081708 |  still 0-0
[10249.78 - 10251.78] P:1748.41 E:0.083432 |  Hummels with the ball halfway
[10251.78 - 10253.78] P:1683.95 E:0.068712 |  inside his own half
[10255.78 - 10257.78] P:1545.03 E:0.079504 |  and then Germany just play it back towards Hummels
[10257.78 - 10259.78] P:1731.24 E:0.076249 |  very, very patient
[10259.78 - 10261.78] P:1627.69 E:0.073217 |  from the three times
[10261.78 - 10263.78] P:1697.36 E:0.080118 |  European champions, Germany
[10263.78 - 10265.78] P:1751.46 E:0.073766 |  record winners of the
[10265.78 - 10267.78] P:1686.71 E:0.066163 |  championship with the Spanish
[10267.78 - 10269.78] P:1664.18 E:0.071375 |  Muller now to the left hand side
[10269.78 - 10271.78] P:1798.47 E:0.068773 |  to Havertz, lots of German
[10271.78 - 10273.78] P:1697.53 E:0.068002 |  shirts inside the England box, Havertz
[10273.78 - 10275.78] P:1696.44 E:0.067338 |  now carrying into the box on the left hand side
[10275.78 - 10277.78] P:1689.88 E:0.068146 |  plays it back to Rudiger, Rudiger back
[10277.78 - 10279.78] P:1753.03 E:0.067901 |  to Havertz again, Trippier comes across
[10279.78 - 10281.78] P:1773.87 E:0.063385 |  then the run of Werner, Werner works it across
[10281.78 - 10283.78] P:1880.61 E:0.068740 |  McGuire with a touch to clear it away
[10283.78 - 10285.78] P:1768.47 E:0.077916 |  and he's cleared it away to Sterling
[10285.78 - 10287.78] P:1754.06 E:0.069888 |  and Germany have players
[10287.78 - 10289.78] P:1861.42 E:0.076632 |  caught downfield, Sterling is
[10289.78 - 10291.78] P:1848.54 E:0.073223 |  challenged by Kroos
[10291.78 - 10293.78] P:1831.44 E:0.078738 |  that is given as a free kick but Tony Kroos
[10293.78 - 10295.78] P:1802.93 E:0.070104 |  runs across, picks up the ball
[10295.78 - 10297.78] P:1848.53 E:0.071539 |  feet wide apart
[10297.78 - 10299.78] P:1753.52 E:0.069218 |  bends over, clutches the ball
[10299.78 - 10301.78] P:1710.13 E:0.063172 |  towards the referee
[10301.78 - 10303.78] P:1704.15 E:0.073286 |  and then gives it to him
[10303.78 - 10305.78] P:1780.70 E:0.067721 |  He's got a point doesn't he
[10305.78 - 10307.78] P:1767.56 E:0.067857 |  he kicks the ball first before he takes
[10307.78 - 10309.78] P:1733.34 E:0.056444 |  the ball, Sterling down
[10309.78 - 10311.78] P:1641.96 E:0.070372 |  Quick word from Karen down behind the goal
[10311.78 - 10313.78] P:1619.94 E:0.070397 |  Where we're most threatening is with
[10313.78 - 10315.78] P:1632.50 E:0.070273 |  Pace, I think we'd agree with Chris
[10315.78 - 10317.78] P:1471.53 E:0.066059 |  we need Sub Sun, get some pace on
[10317.78 - 10319.78] P:1691.61 E:0.073999 |  Sancho, Rashid Green, it's just someone
[10319.78 - 10321.78] P:1638.09 E:0.074692 |  Kane still doesn't look like he's
[10321.78 - 10323.78] P:1674.02 E:0.064763 |  moving right to me and Pace against
[10323.78 - 10325.78] P:1612.45 E:0.069079 |  Hummels, it's scary, we need a change
[10325.78 - 10327.78] P:1510.71 E:0.069851 |  we've got them, I can feel it, the crowd
[10327.78 - 10329.78] P:1623.41 E:0.067149 |  can feel it, the players can, it's just that final
[10329.78 - 10331.78] P:1469.80 E:0.071236 |  third, it's got to be a Sub, it's got to be soon
[10331.78 - 10333.78] P:1654.36 E:0.073713 |  England nil, Germany nil
[10333.78 - 10335.78] P:1607.03 E:0.061373 |  Germany nil
[10335.78 - 10337.78] P:1616.02 E:0.077816 |  The penultimate match in the last 16 at Euro
[10337.78 - 10339.78] P:1715.83 E:0.074215 |  2020, Sweden against Ukraine
[10339.78 - 10341.78] P:1627.73 E:0.073609 |  tonight, the winners of these two matches
[10341.78 - 10343.78] P:1640.75 E:0.072799 |  will meet in Rome on Saturday night
[10343.78 - 10345.78] P:1598.68 E:0.071473 |  you'll be able to hear it, you'll be able to hear
[10345.78 - 10347.78] P:1554.78 E:0.063667 |  all of the quarterfinals on 5 live
[10347.78 - 10349.78] P:1547.59 E:0.065612 |  on Friday and Saturday
[10349.78 - 10351.78] P:1589.61 E:0.066455 |  England, Steve Holland
[10351.78 - 10353.78] P:1617.14 E:0.072866 |  and Gareth Southgate were in discussions together there
[10353.78 - 10355.78] P:1607.49 E:0.065481 |  and Grealish is coming on
[10355.78 - 10357.78] P:1692.59 E:0.077000 |  Karen says he's been given the signal
[10357.78 - 10359.78] P:1737.86 E:0.077005 |  as Saka has picked up
[10359.78 - 10361.78] P:1629.95 E:0.074258 |  for a foul on Ruediga
[10361.78 - 10363.78] P:1651.85 E:0.075330 |  Kieran Trippia comes across
[10363.78 - 10365.78] P:1723.03 E:0.071843 |  and the referee is quickly
[10365.78 - 10367.78] P:1778.42 E:0.073773 |  across, it's only a free kick
[10367.78 - 10369.78] P:1768.49 E:0.076698 |  so Grealish is coming on
[10369.78 - 10371.78] P:1799.18 E:0.072669 |  Stirland's getting no joy
[10371.78 - 10373.78] P:1839.18 E:0.072028 |  he's had a lot of ball, good positions
[10373.78 - 10375.78] P:1766.54 E:0.080714 |  never used it well, never used it early enough
[10375.78 - 10377.78] P:1752.46 E:0.067081 |  never made a decision
[10377.78 - 10379.78] P:1797.79 E:0.074104 |  Saka started to gain break for 10 minutes
[10379.78 - 10381.78] P:1743.18 E:0.077062 |  15 and he's gone out the game completely
[10381.78 - 10383.78] P:1859.47 E:0.078501 |  and he can even say about Harry Kane
[10383.78 - 10385.78] P:1880.54 E:0.077821 |  to be perfectly honest, Harry Kane hasn't done
[10385.78 - 10387.78] P:1937.82 E:0.072319 |  a lot to this game either
[10387.78 - 10389.78] P:1963.62 E:0.074944 |  England have simply struggled for goals
[10389.78 - 10391.78] P:1938.26 E:0.071785 |  at this championship, just the two
[10391.78 - 10393.78] P:1928.49 E:0.070598 |  games so far and this is the fourth match
[10393.78 - 10395.78] P:1894.49 E:0.072881 |  however, they're yet to concede
[10395.78 - 10397.78] P:1773.39 E:0.070291 |  one yet, here is Hummels
[10397.78 - 10399.78] P:1892.99 E:0.071642 |  Hummels stepping forward
[10399.78 - 10401.78] P:1835.97 E:0.072846 |  into the centre circle
[10401.78 - 10403.78] P:1731.60 E:0.069244 |  the options simply weren't there
[10403.78 - 10405.78] P:1708.95 E:0.070089 |  and I think Verna was on
[10405.78 - 10407.78] P:1689.29 E:0.070627 |  Verna was on there through the middle
[10407.78 - 10409.78] P:1759.61 E:0.073065 |  massive space, he didn't see it Hummels
[10409.78 - 10411.78] P:1664.13 E:0.068128 |  but Hummels was unwilling or wasn't able
[10411.78 - 10413.78] P:1758.79 E:0.077677 |  to hit the pass and then it's given away
[10413.78 - 10415.78] P:1773.29 E:0.074973 |  by Kroos and Maguire's claiming that
[10415.78 - 10417.78] P:1829.89 E:0.070818 |  he was checked by Kinnick who came
[10417.78 - 10419.78] P:1813.58 E:0.068800 |  across in no free kick
[10419.78 - 10421.78] P:1819.80 E:0.073727 |  this match very much being played
[10421.78 - 10423.78] P:1757.58 E:0.069682 |  in between the two penalty areas
[10423.78 - 10425.78] P:1738.38 E:0.068458 |  at the moment
[10425.78 - 10427.78] P:1721.42 E:0.066981 |  Garetska to the right hand side
[10429.78 - 10431.78] P:1770.76 E:0.079247 |  Kinnick left footer ball over the top
[10431.78 - 10433.78] P:1902.71 E:0.075868 |  Pickford comes, big shout from Pickford
[10433.78 - 10435.78] P:1894.50 E:0.077499 |  and he caught it, Walker ducked out of the way
[10435.78 - 10437.78] P:1784.02 E:0.079776 |  and the ball dropped into
[10437.78 - 10439.78] P:1837.79 E:0.083085 |  Pickford's arms and I think
[10439.78 - 10441.78] P:1765.30 E:0.082432 |  the screen must have shown that Jack
[10441.78 - 10443.78] P:1800.06 E:0.072775 |  Grealish has now got his
[10443.78 - 10445.78] P:1812.80 E:0.069217 |  track suit top off
[10445.78 - 10447.78] P:1720.72 E:0.077060 |  and I can see him over there, White shirt
[10447.78 - 10449.78] P:1621.48 E:0.070978 |  and he's going on the back
[10449.78 - 10451.78] P:1650.04 E:0.080584 |  Kinnick is coming on as well for Germany
[10451.78 - 10453.78] P:1720.46 E:0.068382 |  I would think that would be for Verna
[10453.78 - 10455.78] P:1610.06 E:0.068824 |  I'd be very surprised if it's not
[10455.78 - 10457.78] P:1627.06 E:0.069317 |  Gnabry who is left out by
[10457.78 - 10459.78] P:1704.16 E:0.065821 |  Jürgen Lürth today having started the first
[10459.78 - 10461.78] P:1640.06 E:0.070377 |  three matches
[10461.78 - 10463.78] P:1678.60 E:0.074697 |  but the former Arsenal man coming on
[10463.78 - 10465.78] P:1825.98 E:0.069196 |  but it's going to be Jack Grealish first of ball
[10465.78 - 10467.78] P:1744.02 E:0.074715 |  once the ball goes out of play
[10467.78 - 10469.78] P:1634.08 E:0.073446 |  just getting his final instructions
[10469.78 - 10471.78] P:1572.93 E:0.063716 |  England nil, Germany nil
[10471.78 - 10473.78] P:1731.25 E:0.076592 |  we've got only a quarter of the match
[10473.78 - 10475.78] P:1708.63 E:0.076021 |  to go, a quarter of the 90 minutes to go
[10475.78 - 10477.78] P:1875.02 E:0.071924 |  and he's passed from Walker, Sackers chasing
[10477.78 - 10479.78] P:1763.91 E:0.075868 |  I don't think he'll reach it, no advances
[10479.78 - 10481.78] P:1792.86 E:0.067558 |  over the white line and he punted
[10481.78 - 10483.78] P:1730.15 E:0.067301 |  into the England fans behind the goal
[10483.78 - 10485.78] P:1736.39 E:0.072907 |  Noia gets a ball back quickly
[10485.78 - 10487.78] P:1703.24 E:0.066060 |  and the referee says, hang on a minute
[10487.78 - 10489.78] P:1748.31 E:0.074747 |  we're not going to take that yet
[10493.78 - 10495.78] P:1830.15 E:0.081743 |  and the first change is the German change
[10497.78 - 10499.78] P:1730.71 E:0.081519 |  and it is
[10499.78 - 10501.78] P:1674.00 E:0.075590 |  Timo Verna who is replaced
[10501.78 - 10503.78] P:1540.05 E:0.071461 |  by the former Arsenal man
[10503.78 - 10505.78] P:1559.26 E:0.071262 |  Serge Gnabry
[10505.78 - 10507.78] P:1599.28 E:0.075705 |  who is on for Germany
[10507.78 - 10509.78] P:1665.82 E:0.069698 |  he'll give a lot of place
[10509.78 - 10511.78] P:1802.37 E:0.078121 |  very quick, some Latsue Verna
[10511.78 - 10513.78] P:1819.15 E:0.071198 |  and the answer to the question
[10513.78 - 10515.78] P:1907.59 E:0.080607 |  who is going to be substituted
[10515.78 - 10517.78] P:1883.50 E:0.079026 |  for Jack Grealish to come on
[10517.78 - 10519.78] P:1807.26 E:0.079451 |  and the answer is Bukajosaka
[10519.78 - 10521.78] P:1866.69 E:0.072118 |  the number 25 is up
[10521.78 - 10523.78] P:1847.13 E:0.070486 |  so Jack Grealish standing there
[10523.78 - 10525.78] P:1869.88 E:0.073025 |  pair swept back of course
[10525.78 - 10527.78] P:1885.61 E:0.080352 |  feet wide apart just doing his stretches
[10527.78 - 10529.78] P:1747.72 E:0.080065 |  waiting to come on into this knockout
[10529.78 - 10531.78] P:1827.77 E:0.072942 |  match here at Euro 2020
[10531.78 - 10533.78] P:1662.80 E:0.078258 |  and listen to the cheer for Grealish
[10533.78 - 10535.78] P:1745.46 E:0.086341 |  Stirling goes to the right hand side
[10535.78 - 10537.78] P:1858.47 E:0.083648 |  Grealish plays left hand side
[10537.78 - 10539.78] P:1818.81 E:0.076468 |  where I think he's best positioned
[10541.78 - 10543.78] P:1886.66 E:0.083182 |  Well that is quite an
[10543.78 - 10545.78] P:1761.43 E:0.069361 |  innovation for Jack Grealish
[10547.78 - 10549.78] P:1697.53 E:0.073775 |  and not just Aslan Duller fans
[10549.78 - 10551.78] P:1482.72 E:0.072553 |  I'm sure who were behind
[10551.78 - 10553.78] P:1609.93 E:0.071538 |  that great noise as he came
[10553.78 - 10555.78] P:1688.32 E:0.066519 |  onto the field
[10555.78 - 10557.78] P:1763.85 E:0.080360 |  as the ball is cleared away by Germany
[10557.78 - 10559.78] P:1658.61 E:0.059940 |  Walker gets his header on that
[10559.78 - 10561.78] P:1692.11 E:0.071500 |  Philips it bounces to Stirling
[10561.78 - 10563.78] P:1676.31 E:0.072316 |  no it bounces away and through to Rudiga
[10563.78 - 10565.78] P:1712.65 E:0.059853 |  Maguire is under this
[10565.78 - 10567.78] P:1609.23 E:0.076959 |  Muller got his head to it
[10567.78 - 10569.78] P:1760.56 E:0.072728 |  but all he can do is head it out of play
[10569.78 - 10571.78] P:1798.60 E:0.084238 |  so England nil
[10571.78 - 10573.78] P:1783.21 E:0.066850 |  Germany nil
[10573.78 - 10575.78] P:1792.52 E:0.075200 |  that's bringing Michael Richards again
[10575.78 - 10577.78] P:1806.23 E:0.071210 |  you've got your man he's on the field
[10577.78 - 10579.78] P:1601.13 E:0.063788 |  Jack Grealish Mika
[10579.78 - 10581.78] P:1459.69 E:0.078128 |  I'm absolutely ecstatic
[10581.78 - 10583.78] P:1593.57 E:0.070996 |  if there's one man who could change his game
[10583.78 - 10585.78] P:1495.40 E:0.077005 |  it's Jack Grealish
[10585.78 - 10587.78] P:1408.47 E:0.071311 |  he looks like he's gone on to the left side
[10587.78 - 10589.78] P:1448.47 E:0.072662 |  he's not going to go to the centre
[10589.78 - 10591.78] P:1516.37 E:0.068397 |  but he will run at people
[10591.78 - 10593.78] P:1620.76 E:0.070310 |  Gimple is on a yellow card as well
[10593.78 - 10595.78] P:1546.96 E:0.061987 |  so as soon as he gets the ball to feet
[10595.78 - 10597.78] P:1650.00 E:0.073702 |  he needs to run and penetrate down that side
[10597.78 - 10599.78] P:1826.98 E:0.069691 |  still waiting for his first touch
[10599.78 - 10601.78] P:1719.16 E:0.069325 |  he has rice now on that left hand side
[10601.78 - 10603.78] P:1843.23 E:0.080925 |  Grealish just peels away sure here is
[10603.78 - 10605.78] P:1698.40 E:0.068665 |  Grealish his first touch
[10605.78 - 10607.78] P:1657.87 E:0.067540 |  puts his foot on the ball
[10607.78 - 10609.78] P:1585.04 E:0.069827 |  in comes the challenge
[10609.78 - 10611.78] P:1670.44 E:0.078441 |  on him and then Havards puts
[10611.78 - 10613.78] P:1702.96 E:0.072195 |  in the challenge and the Kimmich is
[10613.78 - 10615.78] P:1626.60 E:0.070078 |  challenge on Grealish
[10615.78 - 10617.78] P:1582.37 E:0.072364 |  well said Mika
[10617.78 - 10619.78] P:1534.91 E:0.061644 |  well said mate
[10619.78 - 10621.78] P:1637.31 E:0.066198 |  called out one didn't he
[10621.78 - 10623.78] P:1486.20 E:0.075982 |  England nil
[10623.78 - 10625.78] P:1532.82 E:0.059801 |  Germany nil
[10625.78 - 10627.78] P:1673.64 E:0.064987 |  20 minutes to go
[10627.78 - 10629.78] P:1702.48 E:0.067521 |  still confident Chris that we're not going to extra time
[10629.78 - 10631.78] P:1628.77 E:0.055098 |  yep definitely
[10631.78 - 10633.78] P:1633.92 E:0.073829 |  Cross playing the ball out towards the right hand side
[10633.78 - 10635.78] P:1667.93 E:0.062236 |  Kimmich is there
[10635.78 - 10637.78] P:1693.87 E:0.071046 |  and back it goes to Ginter
[10637.78 - 10639.78] P:1552.28 E:0.071220 |  the Germans
[10639.78 - 10641.78] P:1779.51 E:0.071275 |  have probably
[10641.78 - 10643.78] P:1771.23 E:0.072784 |  the shot that Havards had
[10643.78 - 10645.78] P:1816.68 E:0.081785 |  often relatively little
[10645.78 - 10647.78] P:1829.06 E:0.071359 |  but he's changed it now Jürgen Lörf with
[10647.78 - 10649.78] P:1716.28 E:0.066420 |  Gnabry on, Serge Gnabry
[10649.78 - 10651.78] P:1693.16 E:0.077391 |  Gnabry looking to run on to this as the ball
[10651.78 - 10653.78] P:1813.76 E:0.080443 |  has played up towards Mollebbe
[10653.78 - 10655.78] P:1747.69 E:0.071633 |  an excellent header from Stones to win it against him
[10655.78 - 10657.78] P:1730.17 E:0.069591 |  and Philips now
[10657.78 - 10659.78] P:1722.46 E:0.069441 |  Trippier wants it, Stirling's out here
[10659.78 - 10661.78] P:1728.92 E:0.066318 |  now on the right hand side after the change
[10661.78 - 10663.78] P:1687.08 E:0.068187 |  that Garas Southgate made
[10663.78 - 10665.78] P:1560.92 E:0.068291 |  Stirling this is all rather ponderous from England
[10665.78 - 10667.78] P:1749.96 E:0.078051 |  Trippier plays it in field and he's just succeeded
[10667.78 - 10669.78] P:1640.42 E:0.072477 |  passing it away but then it's been given away by Goretzka
[10669.78 - 10671.78] P:1860.17 E:0.071101 |  and we're seeing
[10671.78 - 10673.78] P:1782.10 E:0.069805 |  the hallmarks Chris of a match like this
[10673.78 - 10675.78] P:1594.73 E:0.066621 |  when the stakes are high
[10675.78 - 10677.78] P:1648.54 E:0.071480 |  and there's not much in the game, little mistakes
[10677.78 - 10679.78] P:1563.44 E:0.076895 |  yes so waiting for that little bit of quality
[10679.78 - 10681.78] P:1635.08 E:0.067783 |  no teams offered it enough
[10681.78 - 10683.78] P:1694.97 E:0.073196 |  in this game and that's why it's no no
[10683.78 - 10685.78] P:1741.42 E:0.070858 |  but there's something, there's got to be
[10685.78 - 10687.78] P:1743.35 E:0.058435 |  two or three good chances before the finals
[10687.78 - 10689.78] P:1690.55 E:0.059711 |  Stirling
[10689.78 - 10691.78] P:1675.65 E:0.083779 |  near the halfway line, oh Trippier was caught
[10691.78 - 10693.78] P:1764.33 E:0.077237 |  and we can hear the cry from here
[10693.78 - 10695.78] P:1722.03 E:0.078102 |  the blood curdling cry
[10695.78 - 10697.78] P:1829.42 E:0.075638 |  as Gosens came in with the challenge
[10697.78 - 10699.78] P:1806.23 E:0.070280 |  and it's a free kick
[10699.78 - 10701.78] P:1783.61 E:0.080167 |  well
[10701.78 - 10703.78] P:1748.81 E:0.076366 |  we got the tline in, it's fine in it
[10703.78 - 10705.78] P:1723.64 E:0.070601 |  and the yellow card, what the cry from
[10705.78 - 10707.78] P:1770.86 E:0.078287 |  Kieran Trippier, you suggested
[10707.78 - 10709.78] P:1696.16 E:0.075585 |  that Kieran Trippier didn't used to do that
[10709.78 - 10711.78] P:1594.47 E:0.065377 |  in Berry and Burnley
[10711.78 - 10713.78] P:1618.14 E:0.058925 |  no he didn't
[10713.78 - 10715.78] P:1751.35 E:0.065428 |  yellow card though for Gosens
[10717.78 - 10719.78] P:1750.47 E:0.080352 |  England waiting to take this free kick
[10719.78 - 10721.78] P:1742.24 E:0.068951 |  he's okay Trippier
[10721.78 - 10723.78] P:1684.19 E:0.070348 |  the cry of the Banshee
[10725.78 - 10727.78] P:1653.50 E:0.081718 |  actually didn't mean that he was hurt
[10727.78 - 10729.78] P:1711.03 E:0.075920 |  so it's a free kick, Grealish makes a run
[10729.78 - 10731.78] P:1517.84 E:0.070399 |  out towards the right hand side
[10731.78 - 10733.78] P:1648.75 E:0.074397 |  but Trippier just delays it
[10733.78 - 10735.78] P:1627.60 E:0.075002 |  Harry Kane waiting near the edge of the box
[10735.78 - 10737.78] P:1651.02 E:0.065280 |  Trippier's played it up towards Harry Kane
[10737.78 - 10739.78] P:1652.13 E:0.070449 |  Kane tried to bring it down, it bounced away from him
[10739.78 - 10741.78] P:1692.87 E:0.069444 |  Kimmick is trying to keep it in
[10741.78 - 10743.78] P:1727.65 E:0.067031 |  because the final touch was off his teammate
[10743.78 - 10745.78] P:1754.53 E:0.061220 |  Kimmick clears it and then Rice
[10745.78 - 10747.78] P:1752.33 E:0.073409 |  in with a challenge and the ball bounces out of play
[10747.78 - 10749.78] P:1822.95 E:0.067927 |  let's go down to Kieran Kearney again
[10749.78 - 10751.78] P:1669.55 E:0.061381 |  at the end of the pitch
[10751.78 - 10753.78] P:1761.51 E:0.073181 |  Grealish is going really really in field
[10753.78 - 10755.78] P:1728.21 E:0.070009 |  on that left hand side and sure
[10755.78 - 10757.78] P:1809.20 E:0.067492 |  there's a lot higher now that I've seen him in this whole game
[10757.78 - 10759.78] P:1730.65 E:0.070494 |  so trying to really push on
[10759.78 - 10761.78] P:1699.13 E:0.073036 |  and give Grealish a little bit more licence to be
[10761.78 - 10763.78] P:1694.60 E:0.068465 |  as an extra midfielder
[10763.78 - 10765.78] P:1749.47 E:0.068215 |  a little bit more rotation as well which is really positive to see
[10765.78 - 10767.78] P:1637.65 E:0.064717 |  England nil, Germany nil
[10767.78 - 10769.78] P:1810.98 E:0.069389 |  BBC Radio 5 Live
[10769.78 - 10771.78] P:1707.39 E:0.060903 |  Trippier plays it forward
[10771.78 - 10773.78] P:1712.44 E:0.069703 |  then it's hooked forward
[10773.78 - 10775.78] P:1798.78 E:0.067628 |  by Gosens
[10775.78 - 10777.78] P:1617.14 E:0.073849 |  and then Walker in with a challenge
[10777.78 - 10779.78] P:1680.04 E:0.071407 |  from Canabri and it's out of play for a throw
[10779.78 - 10781.78] P:1578.41 E:0.058890 |  the Germans want to take it but
[10781.78 - 10783.78] P:1758.75 E:0.064555 |  Trippier has just gone down
[10783.78 - 10785.78] P:1653.21 E:0.073854 |  feeling his right hip
[10785.78 - 10789.78] P:1657.11 E:0.068740 |  and he is going to need some treatment
[10789.78 - 10791.78] P:1645.49 E:0.064045 |  could be hamstring
[10791.78 - 10793.78] P:1595.43 E:0.066696 |  these long seasons
[10793.78 - 10795.78] P:1669.09 E:0.071873 |  and at Lettacul Madrid
[10795.78 - 10799.78] P:1648.91 E:0.071020 |  what a tough campaign they had to
[10799.78 - 10803.78] P:1639.82 E:0.070872 |  hang on and stay in there and win the league
[10803.78 - 10805.78] P:1581.63 E:0.079276 |  Rhys James is also warming up over there on the far side
[10805.78 - 10807.78] P:1727.12 E:0.067876 |  so a stoppage in play
[10807.78 - 10809.78] P:1543.94 E:0.069195 |  with under 20 minutes to play
[10809.78 - 10811.78] P:1596.13 E:0.074836 |  Trippier continuing to receive treatment
[10811.78 - 10813.78] P:1671.71 E:0.066645 |  on his left leg
[10813.78 - 10815.78] P:1580.20 E:0.066412 |  I don't know if it's a knee in the back
[10815.78 - 10817.78] P:1727.18 E:0.069363 |  no, it's swung his left leg at it
[10817.78 - 10819.78] P:1692.98 E:0.071173 |  and I think he's tweaked his hamstring
[10819.78 - 10821.78] P:1724.65 E:0.071874 |  looks like it
[10821.78 - 10823.78] P:1692.25 E:0.073415 |  we're just seeing the replay now
[10823.78 - 10825.78] P:1656.11 E:0.071271 |  and now a little screen in the commentary position here
[10825.78 - 10827.78] P:1822.32 E:0.062553 |  that you would think that's going to
[10827.78 - 10829.78] P:1621.92 E:0.071889 |  that's going to be the end of his match
[10829.78 - 10831.78] P:1721.63 E:0.065005 |  you would think
[10831.78 - 10833.78] P:1671.14 E:0.074251 |  possibly the end of his tournament
[10833.78 - 10835.78] P:1706.80 E:0.070168 |  Rhys James waiting to come on to replace him
[10835.78 - 10837.78] P:1501.65 E:0.057388 |  remains nil nil
[10837.78 - 10839.78] P:1456.46 E:0.074771 |  tight affair
[10839.78 - 10841.78] P:1584.89 E:0.062415 |  in this European championship
[10841.78 - 10843.78] P:1587.50 E:0.077277 |  round of 16 match
[10843.78 - 10845.78] P:1548.55 E:0.075934 |  remarkable actually if you haven't heard this
[10845.78 - 10847.78] P:1519.13 E:0.068956 |  England have only ever won two matches
[10847.78 - 10849.78] P:1498.27 E:0.072429 |  two matches in the knockout stages
[10849.78 - 10851.78] P:1598.86 E:0.073343 |  of the European championship
[10851.78 - 10853.78] P:1501.12 E:0.064529 |  one was on penalties against Spain at Euro 96
[10853.78 - 10855.78] P:1571.16 E:0.072520 |  and the other was a third place playoff
[10855.78 - 10857.78] P:1659.46 E:0.077868 |  in 1968
[10857.78 - 10859.78] P:1696.77 E:0.070900 |  these are rare birds
[10859.78 - 10861.78] P:1741.67 E:0.063886 |  Trippier is going to say if he can carry on
[10861.78 - 10863.78] P:1739.30 E:0.075612 |  plays back underway
[10863.78 - 10865.78] P:1661.51 E:0.070638 |  ball played to Greenleith
[10865.78 - 10867.78] P:1743.91 E:0.081896 |  but he can't reach that, it bounces away
[10867.78 - 10869.78] P:1835.91 E:0.072845 |  and Kieran Trippier
[10869.78 - 10871.78] P:1759.67 E:0.066326 |  is waving his arms around
[10871.78 - 10873.78] P:1794.04 E:0.061303 |  and looks as though he's absolutely fine
[10873.78 - 10875.78] P:1614.66 E:0.077177 |  you've got to say though
[10875.78 - 10877.78] P:1720.64 E:0.069800 |  let's analyse in the game at the minute
[10877.78 - 10879.78] P:1572.23 E:0.067100 |  75 minutes coming up and
[10879.78 - 10881.78] P:1752.86 E:0.061655 |  England haven't done enough
[10881.78 - 10883.78] P:1716.33 E:0.071354 |  anything in the second half
[10883.78 - 10885.78] P:1769.57 E:0.064444 |  in possession they haven't done enough
[10885.78 - 10887.78] P:1819.37 E:0.069357 |  they've passed it square back slow
[10887.78 - 10889.78] P:1817.44 E:0.062876 |  there's no risk football
[10889.78 - 10891.78] P:1807.99 E:0.069032 |  there's nobody
[10891.78 - 10893.78] P:1675.19 E:0.074270 |  right in Stirling's beat one or two men
[10893.78 - 10895.78] P:1698.97 E:0.068549 |  and that's what loses it
[10895.78 - 10897.78] P:1746.08 E:0.066310 |  there's no end prod from anybody
[10897.78 - 10899.78] P:1751.71 E:0.072147 |  tournament football Lord Chris
[10899.78 - 10901.78] P:1728.79 E:0.076655 |  well that was what they said in the group
[10901.78 - 10903.78] P:1788.63 E:0.075170 |  this is a knockout mate you go home if you lose
[10903.78 - 10905.78] P:1755.04 E:0.067330 |  ball played up towards Stirling
[10905.78 - 10907.78] P:1739.81 E:0.073673 |  Stirling now, Stirling trying to run in
[10907.78 - 10909.78] P:1852.84 E:0.078028 |  field past Rudiger plays it through to Kane in the D
[10909.78 - 10911.78] P:1917.57 E:0.072264 |  now Kane back to Greenleith
[10911.78 - 10913.78] P:1916.68 E:0.078849 |  Greenleith works into the left hand side
[10913.78 - 10915.78] P:1957.80 E:0.083174 |  Pshaws ball because Stirling's there
[10915.78 - 10917.78] P:1900.55 E:0.082190 |  England lead
[10917.78 - 10919.78] P:1823.06 E:0.081899 |  what a noise at Wembley stadium
[10919.78 - 10921.78] P:1872.75 E:0.090172 |  Stirling scores again for
[10921.78 - 10923.78] P:1798.79 E:0.082486 |  England
[10923.78 - 10925.78] P:1796.08 E:0.084506 |  three goals at the tournament
[10925.78 - 10927.78] P:1822.52 E:0.087169 |  and all three for Raheem Stirling
[10927.78 - 10929.78] P:1631.77 E:0.087922 |  and there are 15 minutes to play
[10929.78 - 10931.78] P:1677.52 E:0.085157 |  and it's England one
[10931.78 - 10933.78] P:1691.46 E:0.082442 |  Germany nail
[10933.78 - 10935.78] P:1695.22 E:0.083500 |  I've got to say
[10935.78 - 10937.78] P:1637.45 E:0.082994 |  England look the more lightly
[10937.78 - 10939.78] P:1599.02 E:0.080516 |  even though they've dawdled on the ball
[10939.78 - 10941.78] P:1614.91 E:0.077390 |  the play too slow
[10941.78 - 10943.78] P:1525.94 E:0.087678 |  this time they get it and they move it
[10943.78 - 10945.78] P:1596.30 E:0.077065 |  and they move it
[10945.78 - 10947.78] P:1612.04 E:0.080683 |  and it's a great ball by
[10947.78 - 10949.78] P:1670.58 E:0.080446 |  Sorkos and it's just saying to anybody
[10949.78 - 10951.78] P:1699.21 E:0.078749 |  in a way to put me in the but
[10951.78 - 10953.78] P:1654.92 E:0.076751 |  and Raheem Stirling
[10953.78 - 10955.78] P:1750.96 E:0.076957 |  yet again scores for England
[10957.78 - 10959.78] P:1766.86 E:0.087502 |  scored just a few yards away
[10959.78 - 10961.78] P:1752.07 E:0.083089 |  from Karen Carney
[10961.78 - 10963.78] P:1606.05 E:0.079008 |  that was unbelievable
[10963.78 - 10965.78] P:1400.25 E:0.081994 |  as soon as the buildup play was happening
[10965.78 - 10967.78] P:1547.80 E:0.077731 |  down his side the news coming
[10967.78 - 10969.78] P:1510.46 E:0.073174 |  you could sense it since Greenleith
[10969.78 - 10971.78] P:1545.18 E:0.080193 |  has come on, Charles got forward there's been
[10971.78 - 10973.78] P:1571.69 E:0.068478 |  more pragmatic the ball was zipped
[10973.78 - 10975.78] P:1719.25 E:0.078254 |  across he was never missing
[10975.78 - 10977.78] P:1709.30 E:0.074672 |  eyes absolute scenes
[10977.78 - 10979.78] P:1663.37 E:0.081177 |  everyone's
[10979.78 - 10981.78] P:1762.39 E:0.076385 |  coming close down onto the mat
[10981.78 - 10983.78] P:1748.68 E:0.072020 |  the stewards are trying to push him all back
[10983.78 - 10985.78] P:1600.21 E:0.073819 |  get in there
[10985.78 - 10987.78] P:1785.54 E:0.086162 |  Michael Richards oh my
[10987.78 - 10989.78] P:1706.66 E:0.078100 |  jubilation this is
[10989.78 - 10991.78] P:1674.74 E:0.077402 |  absolutely incredible
[10991.78 - 10993.78] P:1620.32 E:0.078277 |  Jack Greenleith gets it
[10993.78 - 10995.78] P:1665.23 E:0.081372 |  and he could have shot or he could have played
[10995.78 - 10997.78] P:1551.16 E:0.076615 |  back to Karen he plays it to Charles
[10997.78 - 10999.78] P:1606.64 E:0.077454 |  Cross and that man Stirling gets his third
[10999.78 - 11001.78] P:1724.84 E:0.077580 |  in his tournament absolute
[11001.78 - 11003.78] P:1614.01 E:0.073681 |  scenes what a day this is
[11003.78 - 11005.78] P:1794.61 E:0.079333 |  just a little little finish in the six yard box
[11005.78 - 11007.78] P:1679.25 E:0.074487 |  Stirling was involved in the buildup
[11007.78 - 11009.78] P:1788.49 E:0.073272 |  Harry Kane who seemed to have
[11009.78 - 11011.78] P:1756.60 E:0.082172 |  an enormous amount of space in the day
[11011.78 - 11013.78] P:1745.75 E:0.080395 |  all of a sudden he laid it off to
[11013.78 - 11015.78] P:1804.24 E:0.077952 |  Greenleith then Shaw
[11015.78 - 11017.78] P:1813.55 E:0.074186 |  low ball across Stirling in the six yard box
[11017.78 - 11019.78] P:1666.66 E:0.075244 |  won Nell England but Germany breaking down
[11019.78 - 11021.78] P:1856.55 E:0.074726 |  field and a free kick near
[11021.78 - 11023.78] P:1727.04 E:0.073728 |  the edge of the box the run
[11023.78 - 11025.78] P:1748.94 E:0.063839 |  from Kimmich
[11025.78 - 11027.78] P:1762.12 E:0.076224 |  the free kick just a couple feet outside the penalty area
[11027.78 - 11029.78] P:1788.24 E:0.074489 |  it was McGuire with the challenge
[11029.78 - 11031.78] P:1757.09 E:0.069940 |  and a yellow card for the Manchester United captain
[11031.78 - 11033.78] P:1719.22 E:0.074745 |  well you know it's like when you score
[11033.78 - 11035.78] P:1676.31 E:0.075110 |  you fall asleep slightly and
[11035.78 - 11037.78] P:1631.56 E:0.074959 |  Germany reacted quickly one down
[11037.78 - 11039.78] P:1731.65 E:0.069619 |  it's Kimmich again on the run isn't it
[11039.78 - 11041.78] P:1721.64 E:0.071887 |  he covers some ground and it's a
[11041.78 - 11043.78] P:1691.74 E:0.077405 |  little ankle top
[11043.78 - 11045.78] P:1773.51 E:0.070444 |  which he goes down
[11045.78 - 11047.78] P:1755.68 E:0.076005 |  McGuire struggling to get there
[11047.78 - 11049.78] P:1742.76 E:0.075730 |  thinks about pulling him down
[11049.78 - 11051.78] P:1768.87 E:0.075743 |  just catches his heels
[11051.78 - 11053.78] P:1804.26 E:0.084133 |  and it's a yellow card it's a great position for Junior
[11053.78 - 11055.78] P:1732.23 E:0.072809 |  this is just outside the D
[11055.78 - 11057.78] P:1741.24 E:0.079833 |  free kick from an angle
[11057.78 - 11059.78] P:1474.28 E:0.077651 |  Germany have already had one in this
[11059.78 - 11061.78] P:1676.25 E:0.071894 |  kind of position in the match
[11061.78 - 11063.78] P:1709.05 E:0.077836 |  they're rather over complicated
[11063.78 - 11065.78] P:1553.12 E:0.075556 |  that one this is a little bit wider
[11065.78 - 11067.78] P:1712.23 E:0.070003 |  to the right Chris
[11067.78 - 11069.78] P:1717.53 E:0.082313 |  I'll be looking at Tony Kruse
[11069.78 - 11071.78] P:1702.05 E:0.074299 |  I think he's going to wrap his foot on it and go
[11071.78 - 11073.78] P:1742.27 E:0.079971 |  to the left
[11073.78 - 11075.78] P:1723.64 E:0.069216 |  he's good enough to reverse it to go back across the goal on it
[11075.78 - 11077.78] P:1715.44 E:0.074551 |  but Kimmich is very good at them as well
[11077.78 - 11079.78] P:1797.94 E:0.071302 |  Haberts is
[11079.78 - 11081.78] P:1853.13 E:0.079411 |  on the left foot
[11081.78 - 11083.78] P:1758.09 E:0.082181 |  Haberts standing to the far side of the ball
[11083.78 - 11085.78] P:1918.23 E:0.074191 |  Muller is there as well
[11085.78 - 11087.78] P:1892.38 E:0.076741 |  they're playing these teams played each other
[11087.78 - 11089.78] P:1825.84 E:0.082245 |  in a tournament
[11089.78 - 11091.78] P:1920.91 E:0.075593 |  Muller scored twice
[11091.78 - 11093.78] P:1905.69 E:0.081917 |  free kick then for Germany
[11093.78 - 11095.78] P:1871.72 E:0.082918 |  dangerous Muller curls in to the top of the wall
[11095.78 - 11097.78] P:1847.65 E:0.084476 |  what a roar
[11097.78 - 11099.78] P:1768.66 E:0.079941 |  almost as big for the sterling goal
[11099.78 - 11101.78] P:1758.64 E:0.078429 |  and then sterling puts in a challenge on Haberts
[11101.78 - 11103.78] P:1708.25 E:0.081951 |  and the ball bounces out
[11103.78 - 11105.78] P:1854.34 E:0.080629 |  and it's a throw near the half
[11105.78 - 11107.78] P:1747.15 E:0.075281 |  I think the crowd can carry them through
[11107.78 - 11109.78] P:1724.56 E:0.086287 |  the last 15 minutes or whatever it's going to be
[11109.78 - 11111.78] P:1806.51 E:0.073900 |  the Germany's going to have to go now
[11111.78 - 11113.78] P:1731.79 E:0.070959 |  and there will be gaps
[11113.78 - 11115.78] P:1731.70 E:0.082499 |  to get in there and get some more chances
[11115.78 - 11117.78] P:1785.82 E:0.077707 |  Raheem Sterling scored for England
[11117.78 - 11119.78] P:1829.08 E:0.072920 |  in the 75th minute
[11119.78 - 11121.78] P:1787.53 E:0.080408 |  and then there's a poor ball out to the right-hand side
[11121.78 - 11123.78] P:1746.40 E:0.078282 |  for Germany and it's a throw in for England
[11123.78 - 11125.78] P:1832.30 E:0.073128 |  that's his 17th goal
[11125.78 - 11127.78] P:1682.32 E:0.073040 |  for England which means
[11127.78 - 11129.78] P:1761.48 E:0.073860 |  he draws alongside
[11129.78 - 11131.78] P:1655.12 E:0.078294 |  none other than David Beckham
[11131.78 - 11133.78] P:1745.10 E:0.073358 |  in the goal scoring charts for England
[11133.78 - 11135.78] P:1620.51 E:0.072792 |  and David Beckham is sitting
[11135.78 - 11137.78] P:1642.30 E:0.076325 |  in the stands watching this
[11137.78 - 11139.78] P:1677.99 E:0.078557 |  and it might be a good time just to mention
[11139.78 - 11141.78] P:1658.21 E:0.079312 |  that when Raheem Sterling
[11141.78 - 11143.78] P:1611.92 E:0.074845 |  has scored for England
[11143.78 - 11145.78] P:1554.42 E:0.076273 |  England have won
[11145.78 - 11147.78] P:1821.30 E:0.081907 |  all 12 previous matches
[11147.78 - 11149.78] P:1562.36 E:0.072617 |  and they are unbeaten
[11149.78 - 11151.78] P:1633.70 E:0.077536 |  in the 25 that he's
[11151.78 - 11153.78] P:1469.27 E:0.075574 |  played for England
[11153.78 - 11155.78] P:1495.23 E:0.074432 |  at Wembley
[11155.78 - 11157.78] P:1607.29 E:0.077114 |  Sterling making the difference
[11157.78 - 11159.78] P:1573.18 E:0.069261 |  he's had a strange game
[11159.78 - 11161.78] P:1715.42 E:0.085164 |  Sterling he did everything right there
[11161.78 - 11163.78] P:1669.58 E:0.073245 |  carried it, laid it off, kept running
[11163.78 - 11165.78] P:1679.83 E:0.067595 |  got himself in the box, tough in
[11165.78 - 11167.78] P:1867.73 E:0.070881 |  all of the games have been strange games for Sterling
[11167.78 - 11169.78] P:1835.70 E:0.076900 |  yeah true
[11169.78 - 11171.78] P:1826.39 E:0.079457 |  he's making a difference with his goals
[11171.78 - 11173.78] P:1808.49 E:0.073591 |  he might not have been able to get them
[11173.78 - 11175.78] P:1823.57 E:0.074038 |  or as many for Manchester City as he would have liked
[11175.78 - 11177.78] P:1833.47 E:0.068988 |  but he's scoring them all for England
[11177.78 - 11179.78] P:1869.94 E:0.071587 |  as Rice breaks forward
[11179.78 - 11181.78] P:1883.74 E:0.070467 |  ball down into the Germany full-back position
[11181.78 - 11183.78] P:1779.95 E:0.069212 |  and Riediger is able to guide it out
[11183.78 - 11185.78] P:1844.38 E:0.074775 |  of player Declan Rice is whipping up the crowd
[11185.78 - 11187.78] P:1766.69 E:0.072016 |  this is the reaction
[11189.78 - 11191.78] P:1837.08 E:0.083405 |  not that they particularly need
[11191.78 - 11193.78] P:1872.96 E:0.071684 |  to be whipped up
[11193.78 - 11195.78] P:1908.18 E:0.086101 |  at the moment
[11195.78 - 11197.78] P:1838.55 E:0.077634 |  Hummels with a clearance, Muller puts in the challenge
[11197.78 - 11199.78] P:1761.91 E:0.070975 |  ball bounces down and Trippie
[11199.78 - 11201.78] P:1678.40 E:0.077189 |  is going to allow that to roll out
[11201.78 - 11203.78] P:1787.14 E:0.074516 |  of play for a throw
[11203.78 - 11205.78] P:1813.61 E:0.074590 |  can't say Germany coming back at it John
[11205.78 - 11207.78] P:1733.67 E:0.072811 |  I just can't say that
[11207.78 - 11209.78] P:1733.44 E:0.073389 |  no I'm looking, they haven't really got the
[11209.78 - 11211.78] P:1635.85 E:0.066891 |  close, it's gone out of the game
[11211.78 - 11213.78] P:1716.59 E:0.075848 |  there's a lot of their players feeling the pace
[11213.78 - 11215.78] P:1728.65 E:0.074770 |  and I don't think that squad's strong enough to bring people on
[11215.78 - 11217.78] P:1757.79 E:0.072729 |  which could change it
[11217.78 - 11219.78] P:1612.07 E:0.076869 |  Rice plays it
[11219.78 - 11221.78] P:1675.95 E:0.072218 |  back to trying to find
[11221.78 - 11223.78] P:1690.32 E:0.074079 |  Grealish but it was cleared away downfield
[11223.78 - 11225.78] P:1496.36 E:0.067411 |  stones
[11225.78 - 11227.78] P:1701.82 E:0.073517 |  Thumps it forward on the volley
[11227.78 - 11229.78] P:1612.08 E:0.059267 |  Rudiger's underneath that
[11229.78 - 11231.78] P:1698.45 E:0.075075 |  Phillips is able to chest it down
[11231.78 - 11233.78] P:1844.86 E:0.074385 |  Calvin Phillips
[11233.78 - 11235.78] P:1742.31 E:0.072682 |  he's quietly had a very good game
[11235.78 - 11237.78] P:1788.36 E:0.059824 |  Calvin Phillips you know in midfield
[11237.78 - 11239.78] P:1744.69 E:0.075500 |  Phillips tidy touch
[11239.78 - 11241.78] P:1883.39 E:0.069975 |  Grealish then forward towards Cain
[11241.78 - 11243.78] P:1840.70 E:0.078484 |  Cain now just forward of the centre circle
[11243.78 - 11245.78] P:1854.30 E:0.077307 |  now Rice is involved
[11245.78 - 11247.78] P:1795.65 E:0.071766 |  England looking for a second goal here
[11247.78 - 11249.78] P:1780.32 E:0.071496 |  Germany would find it very difficult to come back
[11249.78 - 11251.78] P:1756.30 E:0.060982 |  from that
[11251.78 - 11253.78] P:1709.12 E:0.072161 |  Rice to Cain inside the penalty area
[11253.78 - 11255.78] P:1782.13 E:0.066583 |  and he's got a good chance of getting
[11255.78 - 11257.78] P:1723.44 E:0.071711 |  a third goal for a Sterling
[11257.78 - 11259.78] P:1770.15 E:0.079246 |  Sterling now moving in field from the right
[11259.78 - 11261.78] P:1837.50 E:0.074587 |  cross goes with him
[11261.78 - 11263.78] P:1892.62 E:0.077017 |  Havertz is going to get there first
[11263.78 - 11265.78] P:1986.20 E:0.074512 |  Havertz is able to play it through for Muller
[11265.78 - 11267.78] P:1849.05 E:0.085356 |  Muller's one on one with Pickford
[11267.78 - 11269.78] P:1717.13 E:0.083453 |  and he's put it wide
[11269.78 - 11271.78] P:1732.98 E:0.080832 |  oh my goodness what an opportunity
[11271.78 - 11273.78] P:1750.04 E:0.077273 |  for the great man of German football
[11273.78 - 11275.78] P:1708.50 E:0.089123 |  Thomas Muller
[11275.78 - 11277.78] P:1675.03 E:0.075456 |  one on one with Pickford who raced out
[11277.78 - 11279.78] P:1704.29 E:0.080673 |  and Muller with his right foot
[11279.78 - 11281.78] P:1724.74 E:0.082624 |  steered it well wide
[11281.78 - 11283.78] P:1657.41 E:0.078107 |  he gives it away to Havertz on half-way
[11283.78 - 11285.78] P:1793.79 E:0.078211 |  Muller's clear
[11285.78 - 11287.78] P:1678.07 E:0.078750 |  they're not going to catch him he gets just inside the D
[11287.78 - 11289.78] P:1608.36 E:0.081110 |  he does well
[11289.78 - 11291.78] P:1664.37 E:0.084368 |  he keeps it low he sends Pickford the wrong way
[11291.78 - 11293.78] P:1734.23 E:0.075568 |  and he misses by what a yard
[11293.78 - 11295.78] P:1677.04 E:0.070782 |  what a chance
[11295.78 - 11297.78] P:1631.09 E:0.076656 |  scuffed it
[11297.78 - 11299.78] P:1650.95 E:0.075712 |  tried to find the bottom corner
[11299.78 - 11301.78] P:1618.05 E:0.072322 |  I was just waiting for the net to bulge
[11301.78 - 11303.78] P:1758.25 E:0.077065 |  you're not going to get a better chance
[11303.78 - 11305.78] P:1701.96 E:0.079911 |  you will not get a better chance
[11305.78 - 11307.78] P:1759.87 E:0.072348 |  England still lead 1-0
[11307.78 - 11309.78] P:1699.31 E:0.079984 |  but what an opportunity
[11309.78 - 11311.78] P:1636.75 E:0.071249 |  the Germans can't believe it
[11315.78 - 11317.78] P:1670.71 E:0.083586 |  it was at the end where
[11317.78 - 11319.78] P:1722.67 E:0.078098 |  there are 2,000 supporters as well
[11319.78 - 11321.78] P:1763.70 E:0.074617 |  they must have thought 1-1
[11321.78 - 11323.78] P:1721.61 E:0.074694 |  all over
[11323.78 - 11325.78] P:1685.36 E:0.078499 |  good no
[11325.78 - 11327.78] P:1727.03 E:0.076384 |  back down to Karen Carney
[11327.78 - 11329.78] P:1720.00 E:0.083951 |  yeah I felt for Sterling he gave that ball away
[11329.78 - 11331.78] P:1706.15 E:0.075399 |  as he was going through he fell to his knees
[11331.78 - 11333.78] P:1774.11 E:0.077517 |  and when he missed the chance
[11333.78 - 11335.78] P:1753.34 E:0.077175 |  Harry Kane and Trippio went and dragged it back up
[11335.78 - 11337.78] P:1860.09 E:0.065972 |  when he missed it let's go again
[11337.78 - 11339.78] P:1805.82 E:0.069708 |  thank goodness he missed though
[11343.78 - 11345.78] P:1790.43 E:0.076447 |  1-0 to England
[11345.78 - 11347.78] P:1796.12 E:0.074360 |  Grealish and Phillips
[11347.78 - 11349.78] P:1709.26 E:0.073606 |  now this is game management
[11349.78 - 11351.78] P:1715.04 E:0.073663 |  now we're talking tournament football
[11351.78 - 11353.78] P:1745.21 E:0.067848 |  with 7 minutes to play
[11353.78 - 11355.78] P:1631.26 E:0.076560 |  Leroy Zane is being prepared
[11355.78 - 11357.78] P:1615.50 E:0.074120 |  on the far side
[11357.78 - 11359.78] P:1771.04 E:0.076077 |  for Germany who needs something
[11359.78 - 11361.78] P:1829.29 E:0.078131 |  Grealish wins ahead
[11361.78 - 11363.78] P:1834.50 E:0.074412 |  bounces down into the full back
[11363.78 - 11365.78] P:1816.34 E:0.073707 |  position played across from Neuer
[11365.78 - 11367.78] P:1637.03 E:0.069419 |  Neuer passes it out from the back
[11367.78 - 11369.78] P:1694.15 E:0.077331 |  Germany
[11369.78 - 11371.78] P:1846.47 E:0.076225 |  in the group Germany were just minutes away
[11371.78 - 11373.78] P:1755.59 E:0.073581 |  going out of the tournament against Hungary
[11373.78 - 11375.78] P:1797.03 E:0.078316 |  before Goretzka scored
[11375.78 - 11377.78] P:1780.39 E:0.071526 |  now again they are facing
[11377.78 - 11379.78] P:1767.62 E:0.071658 |  the exit
[11379.78 - 11381.78] P:1765.52 E:0.074811 |  from Euro 2020
[11381.78 - 11383.78] P:1730.42 E:0.076027 |  in 7 minutes time
[11383.78 - 11385.78] P:1692.53 E:0.079189 |  Sterling in an offside position for England

[11423.78 - 11425.78] P:1796.85 E:0.078511 |  by Gorsons but Pickford is out again

[11483.78 - 11485.78] P:1739.07 E:0.077501 |  but that doesn't work for Germany
[11485.78 - 11487.78] P:1637.43 E:0.080421 |  and Kain now peels away

[11489.78 - 11491.78] P:1800.95 E:0.077428 |  Stirling was ready Kain keeps possession

[11619.78 - 11621.78] P:1621.85 E:0.075130 |  I'm not sure
[11621.78 - 11623.78] P:1838.62 E:0.076948 |  but Harry Kane was there

[11637.78 - 11639.78] P:1850.25 E:0.073711 |  he had to stretch for it
[11639.78 - 11641.78] P:1757.85 E:0.080582 |  as it was played in by Jack Grealish
[11641.78 - 11643.78] P:1668.87 E:0.078932 |  and while England bring on Henderson
[11643.78 - 11645.78] P:1809.78 E:0.074059 |  for Declan Rice

[11657.78 - 11659.78] P:1612.04 E:0.078118 |  he had an effect on the first goal
[11659.78 - 11661.78] P:1703.84 E:0.075790 |  creating the space
[11661.78 - 11663.78] P:1605.19 E:0.070209 |  and in the second goal
[11663.78 - 11665.78] P:1606.13 E:0.086799 |  absolutely astonishing decision
[11665.78 - 11667.78] P:1552.47 E:0.082811 |  for Harry Kane

[11909.78 - 11911.78] P:1656.20 E:0.070506 |  this season
[11911.78 - 11913.78] P:1738.26 E:0.076784 |  but he was born in Stuttgart
[11913.78 - 11915.78] P:1757.25 E:0.074980 |  as you probably know he's making
[11915.78 - 11917.78] P:1737.39 E:0.078275 |  really great strikes
[11917.78 - 11919.78] P:1705.63 E:0.081076 |  at Bayern Munich and here he is now
[11919.78 - 11921.78] P:1727.75 E:0.073881 |  having won the three Lions

[11925.78 - 11927.78] P:1611.02 E:0.070401 |  18 year old comes on
[11927.78 - 11929.78] P:1659.82 E:0.072772 |  to replace Thomas Muller
[11929.78 - 11931.78] P:1678.09 E:0.073709 |  who might be another one who's saying goodbye

[11933.78 - 11935.78] P:1648.67 E:0.068901 |  they might use him
[11935.78 - 11937.78] P:1699.71 E:0.078291 |  up to the next word, use him as a squad player
[11937.78 - 11939.78] P:1798.17 E:0.075713 |  he's got good experiences, good in the change

[11949.78 - 11951.78] P:1817.13 E:0.072002 |  against South Korea for the Germans
[11951.78 - 11953.78] P:1774.23 E:0.069185 |  but this time Neuer was able to get there

[11971.78 - 11973.78] P:1852.23 E:0.080922 |  into the box but Pickford comes
[11973.78 - 11975.78] P:1837.99 E:0.074674 |  and makes the catch and drops onto his front
[11975.78 - 11977.78] P:1825.44 E:0.073911 |  inside the penalty area

[12235.78 - 12237.78] P:1778.46 E:0.082145 |  and he's currently going round

[12243.78 - 12245.78] P:1709.76 E:0.081653 |  towards them and then he just breaks
[12245.78 - 12247.78] P:1753.52 E:0.070716 |  from applauding the fans
[12247.78 - 12249.78] P:1759.98 E:0.080690 |  and gives Calvin Phillips a huge

[12267.78 - 12269.78] P:1608.20 E:0.077077 |  to indicate the player of the game
[12269.78 - 12271.78] P:1487.48 E:0.076221 |  and it's gone to Harry McGuire
[12271.78 - 12273.78] P:1514.78 E:0.083167 |  and there's now a collective group

[12299.78 - 12301.78] P:1650.16 E:0.080344 |  did this in dribs and drabs
[12301.78 - 12303.78] P:1751.19 E:0.081292 |  after the first game against Croatia
[12303.78 - 12305.78] P:1800.60 E:0.074756 |  there were a collective Scotland

[12307.78 - 12309.78] P:1691.72 E:0.078666 |  but look at the togetherness now
[12309.78 - 12311.78] P:1690.25 E:0.076144 |  of this squad of players with those fans behind you
[12311.78 - 12313.78] P:1709.45 E:0.073706 |  Experience though as well

[12347.78 - 12349.78] P:1662.18 E:0.073717 |  it might not be this attractive way
[12349.78 - 12351.78] P:1594.82 E:0.072393 |  but it's the England way and we're getting it done
[12353.78 - 12355.78] P:1751.73 E:0.087881 |  and as the players just finished their lap of honour

[12361.78 - 12363.78] P:1722.29 E:0.074500 |  the whole of the England backroom staff
[12363.78 - 12365.78] P:1742.04 E:0.069814 |  have stayed
[12365.78 - 12367.78] P:1711.64 E:0.077010 |  in front of the benches
[12367.78 - 12369.78] P:1747.42 E:0.072126 |  to applaud the players as they come

[12377.78 - 12379.78] P:1705.71 E:0.076620 |  actually having a laugh with Jack Greelish
[12379.78 - 12381.78] P:1648.59 E:0.073839 |  and he ruffled his hair
[12381.78 - 12383.78] P:1696.40 E:0.078329 |  and it was almost as if he was saying to Jack Greelish
[12383.78 - 12385.78] P:1487.83 E:0.071722 |  you did exactly what I asked of you
[12385.78 - 12387.78] P:1514.98 E:0.076697 |  and they both had beaming smiles
[12387.78 - 12389.78] P:1477.34 E:0.077267 |  on their faces
[12389.78 - 12391.78] P:1494.89 E:0.075431 |  and you're right the England players have gone around the stadium
[12391.78 - 12393.78] P:1595.02 E:0.079068 |  and are now moving through that

[12399.78 - 12401.78] P:1335.16 E:0.074382 |  and
[12401.78 - 12403.78] P:1472.04 E:0.084302 |  many of the England players have actually stayed
[12403.78 - 12405.78] P:1547.49 E:0.081215 |  just a little further back
[12405.78 - 12407.78] P:1553.78 E:0.077158 |  down that side because there's a big
[12407.78 - 12409.78] P:1405.34 E:0.082624 |  gathering of England fans
[12409.78 - 12411.78] P:1595.65 E:0.083623 |  just behind some of the television arc lights
[12411.78 - 12413.78] P:1619.48 E:0.075725 |  there as well
[12413.78 - 12415.78] P:1560.38 E:0.086059 |  but there's still a job to be done
[12415.78 - 12417.78] P:1703.18 E:0.079274 |  in these Euros
[12417.78 - 12419.78] P:1637.98 E:0.083321 |  and they will leave Wembley now
[12419.78 - 12421.78] P:1756.28 E:0.077030 |  with the prospect of
[12421.78 - 12423.78] P:1707.00 E:0.077342 |  perhaps being back here for the semi-finals
[12423.78 - 12425.78] P:1445.08 E:0.081255 |  I wonder whether that's
[12425.78 - 12427.78] P:1462.29 E:0.086669 |  some friends and family in that corner
[12427.78 - 12429.78] P:1717.49 E:0.080310 |  where Calvin Phillips
[12429.78 - 12431.78] P:1710.47 E:0.077402 |  and Kyle Walker
[12431.78 - 12433.78] P:1704.72 E:0.082037 |  and Jack Greelish
[12433.78 - 12435.78] P:1618.86 E:0.074201 |  and Declan Rice
[12435.78 - 12437.78] P:1631.36 E:0.076563 |  have kind of stayed as they're
[12437.78 - 12439.78] P:1619.86 E:0.075873 |  taking sweet Caroline to each other
[12439.78 - 12441.78] P:1549.35 E:0.077246 |  but I wonder if there's some friends and family
[12441.78 - 12443.78] P:1550.75 E:0.076096 |  in that area
[12443.78 - 12445.78] P:1653.01 E:0.083103 |  the way they've paused and are looking and pointing
[12445.78 - 12447.78] P:1606.82 E:0.069112 |  would suggest that it is
[12447.78 - 12449.78] P:1626.35 E:0.068820 |  I don't know why my tickets are not over there
[12449.78 - 12451.78] P:1618.00 E:0.076021 |  if it's friends and family there anyway
[12451.78 - 12453.78] P:1388.21 E:0.067343 |  which one are you claiming to be a friend of
[12453.78 - 12455.78] P:1598.73 E:0.080036 |  which one are you claiming to be a friend of
[12455.78 - 12457.78] P:1568.34 E:0.080673 |  which one are you claiming to be a friend of
[12457.78 - 12459.78] P:1428.43 E:0.076441 |  who are you claiming to be a friend of
[12459.78 - 12461.78] P:1504.39 E:0.070395 |  who are you claiming to be a friend of
[12461.78 - 12463.78] P:1666.97 E:0.073963 |  who are you claiming to be a friend of
[12463.78 - 12465.78] P:1384.60 E:0.071922 |  served on
[12465.78 - 12467.78] P:1248.82 E:0.080984 |  to that man
[12467.78 - 12469.98] P:1366.40 E:0.076542 |  you know who يśmy
[12470.78 - 12471.78] P:1299.61 E:0.080983 |  my friend is
[12471.78 - 12473.78] P:1536.53 E:0.081979 |  Super Jack Greelish
[12473.78 - 12475.78] P:1631.22 E:0.081215 |  Honestly
[12475.78 - 12477.78] P:1710.65 E:0.077522 |  I'm just so proud of them
[12477.78 - 12479.78] P:1630.00 E:0.078457 |  We talked about the emotions
[12479.78 - 12481.78] P:1658.00 E:0.070883 |  before the game
[12481.78 - 12483.78] P:1581.87 E:0.080901 |  what would it mean to some of these players
[12483.78 - 12485.78] P:1629.66 E:0.081386 |  and they've stepped up
[12485.78 - 12491.74] P:1841.59 E:0.076567 |  Yes, it wasn't the most electrifying performance from the Cup to the job done.
[12491.74 - 12495.10] P:1638.76 E:0.080093 |  They managed the game, another clean sheet,
[12495.10 - 12499.10] P:1590.81 E:0.066771 |  Pinkford outstanding, substituted the job when they came on.
[12499.10 - 12500.10] P:1645.90 E:0.064009 |  Really good.
[12502.94 - 12505.70] P:1675.54 E:0.085391 |  Let's focus on the England defence, shall we, at this point,
[12505.70 - 12508.38] P:1585.14 E:0.071192 |  because Harry Maguire has got the player of the match.
[12508.38 - 12512.78] P:1627.68 E:0.076546 |  They went to three at the back today, they still haven't conceded a goal.
[12512.78 - 12515.34] P:1746.87 E:0.084389 |  Germany's best chance came from a Raheem Stirling error
[12515.34 - 12517.98] P:1613.99 E:0.066537 |  when he gave the ball away.
[12517.98 - 12522.70] P:1594.31 E:0.078333 |  I mean, in what has been quite a free-scoring tournament, Chris,
[12522.70 - 12525.38] P:1623.54 E:0.081657 |  that's some effort to have gone through four games out
[12525.38 - 12527.10] P:1583.81 E:0.078082 |  without conceding a goal.
[12527.10 - 12530.50] P:1846.49 E:0.080240 |  Yeah, I think every game we've watched, the opposition could have a goal.
[12530.50 - 12533.46] P:1763.80 E:0.073788 |  Timo Verne should score at this level of football,
[12533.46 - 12535.70] P:1870.15 E:0.080545 |  indefinitely, in what I should at least hit the target,
[12535.70 - 12537.50] P:1610.40 E:0.074092 |  I'll make the goal and save it.
[12537.50 - 12542.02] P:1732.47 E:0.076430 |  But, you know, apart from one or two occasions, they've defended well.
[12542.02 - 12546.62] P:1714.66 E:0.080467 |  What could you improve on, I think, going forward?
[12546.62 - 12550.02] P:1592.84 E:0.068648 |  I think, if you're going to play that, the wing-backs have got to be
[12550.02 - 12553.50] P:1618.08 E:0.064757 |  a bit more creative, they've got to play wing-backs, not full-backs.
[12553.50 - 12556.10] P:1667.85 E:0.071868 |  This was an awkward game today, you can see he's thinking,
[12556.10 - 12558.86] P:1677.82 E:0.074090 |  I don't want to give anything away, so I'm going to play full-backs,
[12558.86 - 12561.14] P:1533.32 E:0.071115 |  rather wing-backs, but they did play wing-backs,
[12561.14 - 12563.06] P:1639.49 E:0.067578 |  but they're not naturally doing that.
[12563.06 - 12567.22] P:1607.18 E:0.070759 |  He had a solid base and he thought, can the front three go and win it?
[12567.22 - 12569.90] P:1675.54 E:0.075986 |  And really, his game plans worked out well.
[12570.86 - 12573.34] P:1519.43 E:0.084763 |  And I'll take your point on the wing-backs,
[12573.34 - 12576.22] P:1621.17 E:0.081223 |  but Luke Shaw was involved in both goals.
[12576.22 - 12580.66] P:1596.78 E:0.085574 |  Set the first one up for Sterling, I believe one of his ex-managers
[12580.66 - 12584.62] P:1671.59 E:0.081088 |  is still wittering away, saying he can't deliver a ball
[12584.62 - 12586.46] P:1651.04 E:0.074579 |  and still criticising him.
[12586.46 - 12590.18] P:1565.39 E:0.081241 |  I don't know where he's saying that, but, you know, he's still having a pop in.
[12590.18 - 12593.70] P:1671.53 E:0.082730 |  Well, his crossing for the first one was decent,
[12593.70 - 12595.30] P:1599.47 E:0.079925 |  because it led to Sterling's goal,
[12595.30 - 12598.78] P:1604.75 E:0.080939 |  and he won the ball and set Greenleash up to set Kane up for the second.
[12598.82 - 12601.02] P:1661.94 E:0.081640 |  Luke Shaw's involved in both those goals there.
[12601.02 - 12602.54] P:1607.36 E:0.066050 |  Yeah, he grew into the game.
[12602.54 - 12604.74] P:1793.95 E:0.076833 |  He grew into the game, and as you're playing the game,
[12604.74 - 12606.74] P:1670.52 E:0.068447 |  you'll notice Germany start dropping off,
[12606.74 - 12608.94] P:1547.11 E:0.071944 |  and we start playing in the England half,
[12608.94 - 12612.74] P:1667.67 E:0.070791 |  you know, in the German half more, push them right back,
[12612.74 - 12614.74] P:1766.37 E:0.068799 |  and they don't want to push them right back.
[12614.74 - 12617.34] P:1602.15 E:0.068023 |  I can go into that 20, 30 yards up the field here,
[12617.34 - 12620.14] P:1784.35 E:0.075149 |  so it grew in confidence as the game went on.
[12620.14 - 12623.14] P:1771.90 E:0.078220 |  And once England scored, you saw all the players grow in confidence.
[12623.14 - 12626.02] P:1822.93 E:0.073865 |  They must have thought, one goal is going to win this,
[12626.02 - 12628.34] P:1874.24 E:0.077992 |  in the event of them getting two, but they all grew in confidence.
[12628.38 - 12630.66] P:1912.82 E:0.069258 |  Once that ball hit the net with Sterling's goal,
[12630.66 - 12632.58] P:1853.06 E:0.061741 |  you could see the team lifted,
[12632.58 - 12634.58] P:1877.40 E:0.076705 |  and you've got to give the fans a lot of current today.
[12634.58 - 12636.58] P:1724.82 E:0.060945 |  The atmosphere has been electric.
[12636.58 - 12640.82] P:1669.49 E:0.069343 |  I think the difference was when Greenleash came on the pitch,
[12640.82 - 12642.58] P:1666.09 E:0.060207 |  he came on the left-hand side,
[12642.58 - 12645.34] P:1521.62 E:0.070739 |  along that wing back side with Luke Shaw.
[12645.34 - 12647.34] P:1484.11 E:0.070432 |  And we all know what Greenleash likes.
[12647.34 - 12650.70] P:1625.28 E:0.066831 |  He doesn't always like to stay wide, he comes inside.
[12650.70 - 12654.58] P:1607.42 E:0.070920 |  Karin Kader made a great point, that's allowed Luke Shaw to go
[12654.58 - 12657.46] P:1659.14 E:0.063023 |  and be more involved, and as soon as that happened,
[12657.46 - 12661.22] P:1668.21 E:0.070196 |  he felt like he had a bit more freedom, a little bit more width.
[12661.22 - 12662.22] P:1650.61 E:0.067566 |  He enjoyed it.
[12662.22 - 12665.70] P:1582.25 E:0.069861 |  I agree with Chris that I think second half of games,
[12665.70 - 12669.22] P:1552.75 E:0.071657 |  games always open up anyway, so there's always going to be more space.
[12669.22 - 12671.30] P:1620.72 E:0.071991 |  I think with Greenleash coming on,
[12671.30 - 12673.78] P:1524.23 E:0.062766 |  it just allowed him to be a bit more expansive.
[12674.62 - 12678.22] P:1610.41 E:0.079370 |  You had the perfect view of how both goals were set up, Karin.
[12678.22 - 12681.46] P:1562.54 E:0.067370 |  Honestly, I'm still recovering.
[12681.46 - 12684.70] P:1642.18 E:0.066954 |  It was brilliant, but like I said earlier,
[12684.70 - 12687.02] P:1475.10 E:0.068103 |  I think Greenleash comes in, he comes infield,
[12687.02 - 12689.46] P:1575.89 E:0.067320 |  and they had to go with him, and Shaw just kind of...
[12689.46 - 12691.02] P:1804.49 E:0.066781 |  It was like the shackles were released,
[12691.02 - 12693.58] P:1571.85 E:0.066430 |  and it was if Saf Gate said, when Greenleash comes on,
[12693.58 - 12695.14] P:1621.06 E:0.063406 |  this is where we're going to turn the screw,
[12695.14 - 12696.86] P:1705.25 E:0.068270 |  this is where we're going to shift gears.
[12696.86 - 12697.74] P:1640.46 E:0.079512 |  And he went in field,
[12697.74 - 12700.62] P:1519.57 E:0.066670 |  Shaw got a lot higher, pushed us forward.
[12700.62 - 12702.62] P:1455.64 E:0.063694 |  Kane was where we wanted him to be.
[12702.62 - 12704.22] P:1445.91 E:0.070840 |  There was just numbers forward.
[12704.22 - 12705.46] P:1624.16 E:0.064812 |  It was a zipline.
[12705.46 - 12707.58] P:1592.16 E:0.059673 |  Again, it goes back to the game plan.
[12707.58 - 12709.66] P:1499.29 E:0.076146 |  This is the moment, this is where we go for him.
[12709.66 - 12712.50] P:1429.47 E:0.067774 |  This is where we've got him against the ropes, we go for it.
[12712.54 - 12715.94] P:1565.31 E:0.066135 |  And credit to them, what was I keep saying about moments,
[12715.94 - 12720.34] P:1412.87 E:0.070272 |  we took our moments, and the team was unbelievable.
[12720.34 - 12722.30] P:1644.52 E:0.063496 |  You know, people are getting cramped,
[12722.30 - 12725.38] P:1627.53 E:0.061997 |  like, ah, honestly, this has been the best game.
[12725.38 - 12727.62] P:1591.23 E:0.069406 |  It has been so, so good.
[12727.62 - 12730.54] P:1647.81 E:0.062789 |  But the key moments, getting Jack on.
[12730.54 - 12733.38] P:1689.56 E:0.071966 |  I know we keep saying it, but he released Luke Shaw
[12733.38 - 12737.34] P:1420.84 E:0.062320 |  and got us a lot higher up, and the confidence in the team grew.
[12737.34 - 12739.38] P:1552.98 E:0.083523 |  Can I just clarify something there?
[12739.38 - 12741.30] P:1565.23 E:0.068277 |  When you say it's been the best game,
[12741.30 - 12743.34] P:1600.93 E:0.069363 |  do you mean the best England game?
[12743.34 - 12744.62] P:1717.56 E:0.072786 |  Yes, thanks, Chappers.
[12744.62 - 12746.22] P:1682.88 E:0.070219 |  You always help each other out.
[12746.22 - 12748.10] P:1719.92 E:0.072168 |  But yeah, the best England game for me.
[12748.10 - 12749.94] P:1710.37 E:0.068413 |  But also, I absolutely love it there.
[12749.94 - 12751.38] P:1755.55 E:0.075398 |  Because, Karen, to be fair,
[12751.38 - 12753.30] P:1595.30 E:0.073448 |  we all sat through yesterday's games,
[12753.30 - 12756.66] P:1670.84 E:0.074219 |  and as much as this great England have won in a through,
[12756.66 - 12758.70] P:1557.56 E:0.071402 |  this game wasn't quite up there
[12758.70 - 12761.10] P:1586.87 E:0.076251 |  with the excitement of what we saw yesterday.
[12761.10 - 12762.86] P:1615.05 E:0.064343 |  The best England game, Chappers.
[12762.86 - 12763.54] P:1271.17 E:0.068557 |  I can always...
[12763.54 - 12766.50] P:1645.59 E:0.065243 |  Also, I think you're starting to believe, Chappers.
[12766.50 - 12767.94] P:1561.13 E:0.077533 |  There's no this.
[12767.94 - 12769.86] P:1673.00 E:0.070604 |  You've thrown out some stats there
[12769.86 - 12771.70] P:1526.34 E:0.070874 |  where you're starting to believe, Chappers,
[12771.70 - 12774.82] P:1512.02 E:0.071208 |  and we're going to turn you, Chappers.
[12774.82 - 12775.66] P:1583.20 E:0.063834 |  It's coming home.
[12775.66 - 12777.78] P:1486.62 E:0.077459 |  Well, one game at a time, Karen.
[12777.78 - 12779.14] P:1632.50 E:0.086076 |  That's what Gareth will be saying.
[12779.14 - 12780.14] P:1823.94 E:0.073957 |  There we go, okay.
[12780.14 - 12784.78] P:1587.33 E:0.070043 |  And I'll be the following Gareth Southgate's mantra on that.
[12784.78 - 12787.06] P:1662.21 E:0.070993 |  But having just seen the replays again,
[12787.06 - 12789.34] P:1589.41 E:0.078206 |  it's always a don't want to over-ed the point.
[12789.34 - 12791.74] P:1642.86 E:0.072402 |  But it's always a do with Luke Shaw,
[12791.74 - 12797.34] P:1669.50 E:0.064921 |  because it was gruelish to Shaw to set up Sterling
[12797.34 - 12799.74] P:1722.89 E:0.067614 |  and then Shaw to gruelish to set up Cade.
[12799.78 - 12801.98] P:1675.31 E:0.070907 |  And the reason I want to over-ed it with him
[12801.98 - 12805.50] P:1651.10 E:0.061181 |  is because the tough time that Luke Shaw had
[12805.50 - 12807.82] P:1582.40 E:0.067171 |  from the horrendous leg break, right?
[12807.82 - 12810.66] P:1663.42 E:0.065386 |  From the horrendous leg break, which, you know,
[12810.66 - 12813.42] P:1641.41 E:0.070153 |  you read some reports, he could have lost his leg
[12813.42 - 12816.42] P:1609.50 E:0.062196 |  when it was such a bad break.
[12816.42 - 12820.78] P:1608.42 E:0.064073 |  And he's fought back and he's dealt with, you know,
[12820.78 - 12823.86] P:1486.42 E:0.058220 |  being treated not great.
[12823.86 - 12825.26] P:1747.40 E:0.082136 |  Oh, I was going to go strong with that,
[12825.26 - 12828.86] P:1629.78 E:0.061604 |  but let's just say not great by one man.
[12828.90 - 12833.58] P:1590.22 E:0.061981 |  And he's worked his way back to confidence and fitness,
[12833.58 - 12835.22] P:1618.49 E:0.079446 |  and he's been integral tonight.
[12835.22 - 12838.78] P:1618.06 E:0.065302 |  And, you know, I just think that deserves
[12838.78 - 12840.94] P:1525.53 E:0.050166 |  the highlight in my game.
[12840.94 - 12843.78] P:1550.77 E:0.066395 |  Yeah, I did an article on him earlier on in the season
[12843.78 - 12846.74] P:1547.57 E:0.061318 |  when he was getting into his great form.
[12846.74 - 12849.10] P:1575.81 E:0.070605 |  I've always liked Luke Shaw from the days
[12849.10 - 12851.86] P:1642.95 E:0.060847 |  when he was at Southampton, always used to go forward.
[12851.86 - 12855.42] P:1592.52 E:0.066782 |  I was always a little bit critical of his final delivery,
[12855.42 - 12856.54] P:1681.24 E:0.077641 |  because he was always in there,
[12856.58 - 12859.90] P:1477.01 E:0.057109 |  and his numbers for Southampton weren't that great.
[12859.90 - 12862.22] P:1543.79 E:0.067054 |  When he got his move to Man United,
[12862.22 - 12863.90] P:1527.94 E:0.058598 |  I thought it was a perfect fit.
[12863.90 - 12868.22] P:1544.64 E:0.061496 |  We expected to see this Luke Shaw a lot sooner.
[12868.22 - 12871.34] P:1533.79 E:0.061738 |  He mentioned the injury, and it's a nasty injury,
[12871.34 - 12875.54] P:1540.96 E:0.060098 |  to come back from the mental side of the game,
[12875.54 - 12877.90] P:1459.19 E:0.066595 |  that no one really, and you talked about,
[12877.90 - 12879.98] P:1478.70 E:0.062118 |  he looked a bit overweight,
[12879.98 - 12883.10] P:1452.36 E:0.057567 |  and to have that in the public eye,
[12883.14 - 12888.46] P:1542.39 E:0.055542 |  and come over all of that and play the way he did today
[12888.46 - 12892.66] P:1642.06 E:0.059363 |  is inspirational, inspirational for younger kids,
[12892.66 - 12895.02] P:1633.49 E:0.059724 |  and inspirational for anyone to say that,
[12895.02 - 12898.70] P:1721.50 E:0.055857 |  when people, you know, count you out,
[12898.70 - 12901.46] P:1585.07 E:0.062389 |  show everyone what a good player you are,
[12901.46 - 12903.94] P:1608.98 E:0.058203 |  and keep believing in your ability.
[12903.94 - 12907.30] P:1595.36 E:0.059565 |  Yes, he wasn't Roberto Carlos today,
[12907.30 - 12910.14] P:1748.10 E:0.061108 |  but he affected the game on a big moment,
[12910.14 - 12912.74] P:1581.72 E:0.062321 |  and that's the difference between a good player
[12912.78 - 12916.58] P:1666.84 E:0.060313 |  and someone who wants to be that world-class fullback
[12916.58 - 12918.82] P:1687.11 E:0.050727 |  who we all thought he was going to be.
[12918.82 - 12922.34] P:1556.28 E:0.068536 |  Played with his body and his mind today, Kara.
[12923.18 - 12924.82] P:1581.53 E:0.077509 |  Yeah, he did.
[12926.26 - 12930.38] P:1589.11 E:0.071970 |  Like Mike said, he's come back from a really horrific injury,
[12930.38 - 12933.50] P:1597.76 E:0.066315 |  and just to have that mentality and to stay in the game,
[12933.50 - 12937.94] P:1392.29 E:0.066093 |  and he did it, it was just a really, really good performance,
[12937.94 - 12939.14] P:1634.11 E:0.069110 |  because we're talking about his attack,
[12939.14 - 12940.82] P:1554.92 E:0.073022 |  and it's defensively he was good as well.
[12940.82 - 12943.86] P:1414.28 E:0.058568 |  You know, there was never really a threat against him at times.
[12943.86 - 12945.54] P:1629.77 E:0.074823 |  You know, their strengths in the German side,
[12945.54 - 12949.86] P:1502.19 E:0.058465 |  half in the wide areas, he got out there, he did his job,
[12949.86 - 12951.94] P:1623.08 E:0.064915 |  and then getting high up the pitch,
[12951.94 - 12953.10] P:1551.70 E:0.065150 |  which is where we want to see him,
[12953.10 - 12955.70] P:1415.68 E:0.066645 |  which is why he broke onto the scene at Southampton and Wormann,
[12955.70 - 12957.78] P:1501.87 E:0.070704 |  you know, I saw him do that tonight,
[12957.78 - 12962.54] P:1522.67 E:0.064153 |  and it was really good, and his end product is why you're in the team.
[12962.54 - 12964.50] P:1519.60 E:0.070882 |  You're judging the final third on your end product,
[12964.50 - 12967.22] P:1388.67 E:0.067267 |  and you're delivered, and I think like we all are,
[12967.22 - 12968.98] P:1505.02 E:0.051002 |  we're all just ecstatic.
[12968.98 - 12970.38] P:1740.35 E:0.073493 |  We always want a positive ending,
[12970.42 - 12971.94] P:1439.66 E:0.046431 |  and that was great.
[12971.94 - 12973.78] P:1562.67 E:0.078383 |  Not everybody's ecstatic.
[12973.78 - 12977.58] P:1750.03 E:0.064722 |  Let's bring Maurice Valtz back in on five live sport,
[12977.58 - 12978.58] P:1582.45 E:0.069630 |  on the Premier League.
[12978.58 - 12979.58] P:1606.77 E:0.069473 |  I'm here.
[12979.58 - 12982.58] P:1779.40 E:0.068267 |  You're here.
[12982.58 - 12984.54] P:1806.01 E:0.061668 |  Well, actually two good chances.
[12984.54 - 12988.02] P:1833.79 E:0.067426 |  Jordan Pickford made an amazing save, didn't he, from Kai Havertz?
[12988.02 - 12990.94] P:1838.45 E:0.062396 |  And then the best chance was Thomas Mullers,
[12990.94 - 12995.34] P:1687.76 E:0.050186 |  which, you know, nine times out of ten, he'd put that away.
[12995.34 - 12997.82] P:1659.91 E:0.052300 |  Yes, absolutely.
[12997.82 - 13000.82] P:1723.58 E:0.065789 |  I mean, he rushed the shot, it went wide,
[13000.82 - 13007.06] P:1739.58 E:0.048054 |  and that was a detail that didn't go right today,
[13007.06 - 13011.94] P:1847.44 E:0.060095 |  but I feel that, you know, the English team may not have been
[13011.94 - 13014.46] P:1777.19 E:0.063700 |  the better team on the night,
[13014.46 - 13017.50] P:1823.15 E:0.064491 |  but they have been the better team throughout this tournament,
[13017.50 - 13022.18] P:1833.43 E:0.054118 |  and I include the qualifiers as well as the group stage.
[13023.46 - 13026.46] P:1788.80 E:0.067061 |  Do you want to give me, you know, we talked to Chris Waddle about it,
[13026.50 - 13029.70] P:1803.00 E:0.056282 |  but do you want to give us all an appreciation of England's
[13029.70 - 13033.50] P:1833.47 E:0.064314 |  defensive capabilities, bearing in mind that they switched to a back three
[13033.50 - 13036.86] P:1797.99 E:0.066426 |  this evening and they're yet to concede a goal in this tournament?
[13036.86 - 13039.46] P:1784.93 E:0.057359 |  It might not be scintillating going forward,
[13039.46 - 13042.66] P:1634.26 E:0.049491 |  but defensively at the moment, they're rock solid.
[13042.66 - 13048.98] P:1731.29 E:0.059934 |  Absolutely, although I will say that they did allow chances today,
[13048.98 - 13053.82] P:1586.00 E:0.058914 |  and the fact that they haven't conceded yet in this tournament
[13053.82 - 13060.50] P:1658.56 E:0.059926 |  is due to very good and resilient and, you know, a short defending,
[13060.50 - 13064.62] P:1761.88 E:0.057414 |  but also today due to the lack of finishing,
[13064.62 - 13067.14] P:1617.47 E:0.063885 |  top-class finishing of the German team,
[13067.14 - 13070.06] P:1680.77 E:0.057737 |  and Müller in Werner, to name a few.
[13073.42 - 13077.06] P:1750.06 E:0.071714 |  Why? I mean, it felt at times in the first half
[13077.06 - 13080.98] P:1776.87 E:0.058962 |  that Germany had the control in that game, the 20-25 minutes.
[13080.98 - 13083.66] P:1754.60 E:0.069669 |  That control didn't really seem to be there in the second half,
[13083.70 - 13086.10] P:1588.53 E:0.046432 |  it was a scrap here, second half.
[13087.46 - 13090.18] P:1637.79 E:0.080365 |  It was a little bit in the beginning, but then, you know,
[13090.18 - 13096.06] P:1597.43 E:0.062221 |  you wouldn't expect a game at this stage of two top sides
[13096.06 - 13102.14] P:1709.81 E:0.058261 |  that are, you know, perhaps equally matched to be a one-sided affair throughout.
[13102.14 - 13106.34] P:1814.64 E:0.055560 |  So I think in the first half England did well,
[13106.34 - 13110.30] P:1686.81 E:0.065766 |  releasing some of that pressure through some injection of pace
[13110.30 - 13113.14] P:1776.85 E:0.057593 |  through both Stirling and Sucker.
[13113.14 - 13116.50] P:1774.19 E:0.069819 |  And I feel the detail, and for me, the winner tonight
[13116.50 - 13118.38] P:1493.80 E:0.066657 |  was always going to be in the detail,
[13118.38 - 13122.30] P:1743.67 E:0.063655 |  and that detail was that Germany, all day long,
[13122.30 - 13125.38] P:1716.28 E:0.058055 |  allowed England to dribble into the centre,
[13125.38 - 13130.38] P:1763.78 E:0.065174 |  and that was a big problem that didn't lead to any goals for England
[13130.38 - 13134.38] P:1799.68 E:0.049469 |  in the first half, but it was punished in the second half.
[13134.38 - 13138.74] P:1793.98 E:0.060459 |  Has detail been lacking for Germany in this European campaign?
[13138.74 - 13141.30] P:1728.28 E:0.059859 |  I mean, we talked after the Hungary game
[13141.30 - 13144.70] P:1881.78 E:0.059847 |  that it was basically just throw on as many attacking individuals
[13144.70 - 13146.54] P:1797.44 E:0.057128 |  as possible and hope for the best.
[13146.54 - 13149.38] P:1623.25 E:0.060140 |  Has detail gone amiss somewhere?
[13151.50 - 13155.06] P:1632.33 E:0.063626 |  Yes, I think that's a point that we have to concede.
[13156.06 - 13160.14] P:1716.78 E:0.063871 |  In all the four games during these years, we went behind,
[13160.14 - 13165.34] P:1736.50 E:0.052024 |  and so, you know, that's something...
[13165.34 - 13171.06] P:1526.15 E:0.061451 |  It's not a coincidence, and sometimes it's a bit of bad luck as well,
[13171.06 - 13176.82] P:1722.15 E:0.052471 |  but over four games, you know, it's a lack of detail.
[13178.26 - 13181.62] P:1817.36 E:0.070782 |  England players just starting to come out of the tunnel
[13181.62 - 13183.98] P:1743.99 E:0.063273 |  now to do some post-match interviews.
[13183.98 - 13188.22] P:1831.46 E:0.065512 |  I can see John Murray on the far side of Wembley Stadium,
[13188.22 - 13191.30] P:1685.21 E:0.069992 |  and when the players start to make their way down towards him,
[13191.30 - 13194.82] P:1754.43 E:0.055153 |  we'll bring you reaction, and we'll bring you reaction
[13194.82 - 13197.02] P:1819.74 E:0.076639 |  on the Euro's daily pod as well.
[13197.02 - 13199.70] P:1895.30 E:0.068259 |  And we still have Sweden, Ukraine to come this evening in,
[13199.70 - 13203.14] P:1597.36 E:0.052841 |  and Dennis and Pat Nevin are at Hamden.
[13203.14 - 13205.06] P:1939.29 E:0.071692 |  We'll get team news from there shortly,
[13205.06 - 13209.14] P:1753.59 E:0.061331 |  and of course whoever wins that then plays England in Rome
[13209.14 - 13210.62] P:1622.27 E:0.061350 |  on Saturday night.
[13210.62 - 13212.74] P:1738.81 E:0.069483 |  Let's hear from the man who won the match.
[13212.74 - 13214.02] P:1893.72 E:0.035207 |  Here's Harry Maguire.
[13214.02 - 13217.26] P:1381.30 E:0.080462 |  Harry, you're here with the Heineken Star of the match award.
[13217.26 - 13218.98] P:1358.91 E:0.080699 |  Sweet Caroline is playing,
[13218.98 - 13221.74] P:1300.32 E:0.079773 |  but how sweet does England to Germany nil sound?
[13221.74 - 13228.10] P:1263.83 E:0.089959 |  It's a bit of a cry out about the atmosphere today.
[13229.70 - 13232.78] P:1087.24 E:0.085234 |  It's a good journey, enough for a total period, so...
[13232.78 - 13236.94] P:1306.41 E:0.082127 |  ..we came out to renew a lot of pressure on us
[13236.94 - 13240.18] P:1187.20 E:0.084686 |  to deliver a performance and to deliver a victory,
[13240.18 - 13242.34] P:1127.74 E:0.084767 |  which is the most important bit,
[13242.34 - 13244.38] P:1283.04 E:0.082307 |  and I think from the start to finish,
[13244.38 - 13246.02] P:1258.34 E:0.085753 |  apart from probably the first 10 minutes,
[13246.02 - 13248.82] P:1352.65 E:0.083650 |  there was a little bit there expected
[13248.82 - 13250.26] P:1436.10 E:0.086485 |  from our pressure on us,
[13250.26 - 13254.26] P:1275.83 E:0.081786 |  but to what might have happened, we couldn't even reserve a victory.
[13254.26 - 13257.58] P:1598.05 E:0.080611 |  You keep slaying some old demons, and Germany, you know,
[13257.58 - 13261.02] P:1498.25 E:0.076108 |  to finally beat them in a knock-out round of a major tournament
[13261.02 - 13264.26] P:1510.18 E:0.071893 |  for the first time since 66, what did it take?
[13266.26 - 13267.78] P:1444.28 E:0.087612 |  Well, I think, first and foremost,
[13267.78 - 13269.78] P:1413.37 E:0.086530 |  they took a huge bravery.
[13269.78 - 13271.42] P:1322.74 E:0.086266 |  Um...
[13271.42 - 13273.22] P:1476.01 E:0.083177 |  Bravery on the ball and without the ball.
[13273.22 - 13275.22] P:1494.73 E:0.084050 |  We wanted to be aggressive, which is wonderful,
[13275.22 - 13277.22] P:1622.27 E:0.080313 |  and it was a good thing for a simple fighter
[13277.22 - 13279.22] P:1665.75 E:0.086019 |  to get better pressure on the ball.
[13279.22 - 13282.22] P:1707.29 E:0.083092 |  We wanted to go man-for-man as much as we can all over the pitch.
[13282.22 - 13284.74] P:1547.39 E:0.081949 |  They dropped deep, the attack was so sometimes it was hard
[13284.74 - 13286.26] P:1543.46 E:0.079625 |  to get to the number 10s,
[13286.30 - 13287.90] P:1407.34 E:0.081502 |  but we wanted to go man-for-man,
[13287.90 - 13289.90] P:1505.56 E:0.081473 |  we wanted to be aggressive, and I think it paid off.
[13289.90 - 13292.90] P:1513.54 E:0.079370 |  We didn't give them any easy possession that we know they like to play,
[13292.90 - 13295.90] P:1415.94 E:0.084187 |  and they have some top players, a good team, very good team.
[13295.90 - 13297.90] P:1466.04 E:0.081031 |  Yeah, I think we needed to be aggressive.
[13297.90 - 13299.90] P:1453.31 E:0.084864 |  Bravery was probably the big word.
[13299.90 - 13302.90] P:1499.42 E:0.079439 |  Bravery with them without the ball, and I think it was a big battle.
[13302.90 - 13305.42] P:1535.94 E:0.077990 |  I mean, Harry and Raheem got the goals,
[13305.42 - 13308.42] P:1581.10 E:0.079945 |  but it's a fourth clean sheet for Jordan.
[13308.42 - 13310.42] P:1622.49 E:0.074311 |  Can you talk about the defensive shift
[13310.42 - 13312.42] P:1615.09 E:0.078802 |  and also Jordan's contribution?
[13312.42 - 13315.42] P:1462.69 E:0.082455 |  Well, first and foremost, Jordan's been magnificent.
[13315.58 - 13319.58] P:1471.21 E:0.081411 |  Every game he's played for England, he's a top-top keeper,
[13319.58 - 13321.58] P:1446.05 E:0.079610 |  and he deserves all the glory,
[13321.58 - 13323.58] P:1483.11 E:0.078384 |  and it's probably going to get after today's game,
[13323.58 - 13326.58] P:1572.34 E:0.078299 |  because he's under a huge amount of pressure.
[13326.58 - 13328.58] P:1478.68 E:0.083206 |  A goalkeeper playing number one for England,
[13328.58 - 13331.58] P:1518.16 E:0.080593 |  he's got the most scrutinised player in world football.
[13331.58 - 13335.58] P:1570.66 E:0.080178 |  So Jordan has been magnificent every time he's put the shirt on,
[13335.58 - 13338.58] P:1531.41 E:0.079935 |  and he was again today, he was magnificent.
[13338.58 - 13341.58] P:1511.89 E:0.082239 |  Yeah, obviously, it's nice to keep clean sheets, that's what we're here to do.
[13341.58 - 13344.58] P:1567.93 E:0.080436 |  It's not the defence, it's the team,
[13344.74 - 13346.74] P:1488.85 E:0.082629 |  it's a unit, we're a solid base.
[13346.74 - 13348.74] P:1462.39 E:0.082800 |  The defence plays really well at the moment,
[13348.74 - 13350.74] P:1535.45 E:0.081735 |  so this is a long-bake-on team,
[13350.74 - 13352.74] P:1496.24 E:0.081435 |  and it comes from the forwards,
[13352.74 - 13355.74] P:1517.00 E:0.078973 |  and it builds back to the defenders, any balls out of our box.
[13355.74 - 13358.74] P:1543.24 E:0.081794 |  Like I say, it's not just defence and goalkeeper, it's a team.
[13358.74 - 13360.74] P:1946.32 E:0.019219 |  It's a team effort.
[13360.74 - 13363.74] P:1937.79 E:0.046181 |  I'll be honest with you, I couldn't really hear that much
[13363.74 - 13365.74] P:1756.47 E:0.066871 |  of what Harry McQuire was saying there,
[13365.74 - 13367.74] P:1776.10 E:0.055513 |  because everything else was really loud.
[13367.74 - 13370.74] P:1862.55 E:0.054331 |  But, erm, what could you, Micah?
[13370.74 - 13373.74] P:1906.75 E:0.067561 |  I mean, normally I like to ask a question off the back of an interview,
[13373.90 - 13376.90] P:1808.53 E:0.065802 |  I'd ask what they've heard, but I've to tell what they've said,
[13376.90 - 13378.90] P:1728.14 E:0.066529 |  but I think I heard the word bravery.
[13378.90 - 13380.90] P:1912.05 E:0.062492 |  It basically said it started at the front, the work hard,
[13380.90 - 13382.90] P:1780.56 E:0.050764 |  and it felt the suit at the back,
[13382.90 - 13384.90] P:1822.67 E:0.055892 |  and Jordan Pickford's being top goalie,
[13384.90 - 13386.90] P:1872.37 E:0.053165 |  because he's a more scrutinised player on the team.
[13386.90 - 13388.90] P:1746.46 E:0.057978 |  Yeah, OK, good, and they were brave.
[13388.90 - 13390.90] P:1678.47 E:0.057536 |  It's nice to see one person listening.
[13390.90 - 13392.90] P:1629.74 E:0.080354 |  No, I wasn't listening, I couldn't hear him!
[13392.90 - 13394.90] P:1900.06 E:0.056371 |  Brave, brave, he kept saying brave.
[13394.90 - 13397.90] P:1832.26 E:0.064883 |  They were brave on the ball, and they showed lots of bravery.
[13397.90 - 13400.90] P:1772.10 E:0.054343 |  Yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, it's a good...
[13400.90 - 13402.90] P:1721.62 E:0.076426 |  It's a hard game, people forget they were playing Jeremy,
[13403.06 - 13406.06] P:1933.77 E:0.061429 |  but they're not going to be able to play for the next few years.
[13406.06 - 13408.06] P:1881.83 E:0.066279 |  So, yes, there's three or four players,
[13408.06 - 13410.06] P:2028.01 E:0.057841 |  will probably retire from international football,
[13410.06 - 13413.06] P:1846.45 E:0.065100 |  and they need to bring some new players in, which they will, I'm sure,
[13413.06 - 13415.06] P:1932.35 E:0.064278 |  develop some new players.
[13415.06 - 13417.06] P:1899.47 E:0.059664 |  I think they won in the 21s this year, didn't they, championships?
[13417.06 - 13420.06] P:1894.98 E:0.061919 |  So, there'll be some new players coming through over the next couple of years.
[13420.06 - 13423.06] P:1912.59 E:0.057848 |  But it was an experience side, and it did cause England a few problems.
[13423.06 - 13425.06] P:1940.09 E:0.049395 |  You can't say they didn't, but overall,
[13425.06 - 13427.06] P:1881.47 E:0.062465 |  England just eventually got on top of them,
[13427.06 - 13429.06] P:1805.60 E:0.051099 |  and you could see the way it was going second half,
[13429.06 - 13431.06] P:1852.44 E:0.059193 |  and England got a reward.
[13431.22 - 13434.22] P:1735.54 E:0.061579 |  I think this is a difficult question, but after seeing four games now.
[13434.22 - 13436.22] P:1839.61 E:0.054754 |  I think they can get the room.
[13436.22 - 13438.22] P:1847.70 E:0.039826 |  So, no, listen, they're in there, they've got a chance.
[13438.22 - 13440.22] P:1884.36 E:0.049612 |  Belgium's got a chance, Spain's got a chance.
[13440.22 - 13442.22] P:1902.89 E:0.045884 |  Listen, looking at the way the tournament is going,
[13442.22 - 13444.22] P:1888.80 E:0.060624 |  Switzerland will fancy the chances after knocking France out.
[13444.22 - 13446.22] P:1961.67 E:0.048755 |  There's a lot to Denmark, you know,
[13446.22 - 13448.22] P:1968.23 E:0.051698 |  the things of what happened to events around them.
[13448.22 - 13451.22] P:1962.37 E:0.057222 |  Denmark have got a strong belief that they think we're going to win it.
[13451.22 - 13453.22] P:1936.54 E:0.062172 |  We're on a mission.
[13453.22 - 13455.22] P:1635.79 E:0.068424 |  But England's definitely going to win it,
[13455.22 - 13457.22] P:1949.34 E:0.064891 |  and it's a good thing that they're going to win it.
[13457.22 - 13459.22] P:1738.80 E:0.068819 |  And it's a good thing that they're going to win it.
[13459.38 - 13461.38] P:2006.43 E:0.056073 |  So, but England's definitely in the pack.
[13461.38 - 13463.38] P:1922.07 E:0.066791 |  You cannot say, well, England's over a cheese.
[13463.38 - 13465.38] P:1806.79 E:0.060292 |  They've got this far, they've got to go out now.
[13465.38 - 13467.38] P:1906.48 E:0.059788 |  No, England should be aiming, then decide the group they've got.
[13467.38 - 13469.38] P:1768.94 E:0.058430 |  Ukraine or Sweden?
[13469.38 - 13471.38] P:1875.67 E:0.066083 |  If somebody said you'd be playing them in the quarterfinals,
[13471.38 - 13473.38] P:1839.13 E:0.048418 |  you'd snap your hand off.
[13473.38 - 13475.38] P:1765.71 E:0.053952 |  So, they've got to believe and think, we've knocked Germany out.
[13475.38 - 13477.38] P:1629.02 E:0.050704 |  All right, people didn't think Germany was great
[13477.38 - 13479.38] P:1977.07 E:0.059817 |  as what they used to be,
[13479.38 - 13481.38] P:1889.72 E:0.061468 |  but it's a good psychological breeds confidence,
[13481.38 - 13483.38] P:1828.33 E:0.061358 |  and I think they can move on from this.
[13485.38 - 13487.38] P:1803.71 E:0.064637 |  Moritz, is this, for Germany,
[13487.54 - 13489.54] P:1810.84 E:0.060318 |  do you feel that this is the end of an era?
[13491.54 - 13493.54] P:1374.49 E:0.048870 |  It is.
[13493.54 - 13495.54] P:1562.52 E:0.062512 |  The era of Joachim Luf to start with,
[13495.54 - 13497.54] P:1682.60 E:0.048129 |  that's ended.
[13497.54 - 13499.54] P:1549.27 E:0.070026 |  I think the era of players like Hummels
[13499.54 - 13501.54] P:1416.14 E:0.059745 |  and Thomas Müller,
[13501.54 - 13503.54] P:1584.44 E:0.061519 |  that's come to an end.
[13503.54 - 13505.54] P:1552.52 E:0.064457 |  And, you know,
[13505.54 - 13507.54] P:1515.44 E:0.052325 |  it...
[13507.54 - 13509.54] P:1469.43 E:0.031978 |  I mean, the fact that Hummels and Müller
[13509.54 - 13511.54] P:1263.67 E:0.076009 |  were brought back,
[13511.54 - 13513.54] P:1742.96 E:0.045961 |  showed that there isn't anybody
[13513.54 - 13515.54] P:1365.68 E:0.077894 |  immediately able to step in.
[13515.70 - 13517.70] P:1454.02 E:0.067877 |  You feel, but maybe on the second attempt.
[13517.70 - 13519.70] P:1683.44 E:0.060650 |  That's what I hoped for, anyway.
[13521.70 - 13523.70] P:1590.69 E:0.032590 |  And, I mean, maybe it's a bit too soon
[13523.70 - 13525.70] P:1701.13 E:0.059637 |  to sort of dissect the reign
[13525.70 - 13527.70] P:1785.99 E:0.066093 |  of Joachim Luf,
[13527.70 - 13529.70] P:1679.10 E:0.061249 |  but what will the feeling in Germany
[13529.70 - 13531.70] P:1616.53 E:0.038297 |  be towards him tonight
[13531.70 - 13533.70] P:1942.56 E:0.074419 |  and in the coming days?
[13535.70 - 13537.70] P:1449.70 E:0.037892 |  Still, I think, overall,
[13537.70 - 13539.70] P:1772.64 E:0.049756 |  a feeling of gratitude
[13539.70 - 13541.70] P:1557.76 E:0.064349 |  you felt through the years
[13541.70 - 13543.70] P:1731.36 E:0.055818 |  and the years you've been in.
[13543.86 - 13545.86] P:1840.28 E:0.062939 |  You felt throughout his reign
[13545.86 - 13547.86] P:1983.69 E:0.052341 |  that he, you know,
[13547.86 - 13549.86] P:1854.14 E:0.053090 |  kept Germany
[13549.86 - 13551.86] P:1777.47 E:0.056855 |  a steady ship,
[13551.86 - 13553.86] P:1798.36 E:0.063613 |  a contender.
[13553.86 - 13555.86] P:1690.93 E:0.040134 |  Now,
[13555.86 - 13557.86] P:1657.39 E:0.061038 |  it's definitely blighted through to...
[13557.86 - 13559.86] P:1796.93 E:0.063760 |  You know, due to the last
[13559.86 - 13561.86] P:1836.14 E:0.061571 |  three years
[13561.86 - 13563.86] P:1731.72 E:0.061209 |  with a disappointing World Cup
[13563.86 - 13565.86] P:1623.60 E:0.065570 |  and then, you know,
[13565.86 - 13567.86] P:1580.45 E:0.078109 |  a disappointing European Championships
[13567.86 - 13569.86] P:1502.23 E:0.057352 |  if we are fair this summer.
[13569.86 - 13571.86] P:1822.11 E:0.064116 |  Because we weren't convincing,
[13572.02 - 13574.02] P:1659.43 E:0.066707 |  we didn't look...
[13574.02 - 13576.02] P:1773.18 E:0.048272 |  You know, we didn't look...
[13576.02 - 13578.02] P:1795.97 E:0.047465 |  ..that we were able to play
[13578.02 - 13580.02] P:1692.28 E:0.071465 |  with any consistency
[13580.02 - 13582.02] P:1673.59 E:0.071603 |  and too little threat.
[13582.02 - 13584.02] P:1871.30 E:0.070086 |  I'm just going to jump in.
[13584.02 - 13586.02] P:1899.96 E:0.064282 |  Thank you very much, because we've got some live interviews now.
[13586.02 - 13588.02] P:1752.77 E:0.066853 |  With John Murray.
[13588.02 - 13590.02] P:1719.89 E:0.070660 |  This time, because it's quiet,
[13590.02 - 13592.02] P:1460.29 E:0.056998 |  I'm going to be able to hear Harry McQuarr,
[13592.02 - 13594.02] P:1514.45 E:0.052185 |  because he's with John.
[13594.02 - 13596.02] P:1536.51 E:0.054599 |  Absolutely, yes.
[13596.02 - 13598.02] P:1606.14 E:0.071228 |  You don't know this, Harry,
[13598.02 - 13600.02] P:1653.68 E:0.060273 |  but we've actually played an interview with you already
[13600.18 - 13602.18] P:1474.99 E:0.068502 |  and we've got the real thing live.
[13602.18 - 13604.18] P:1282.21 E:0.068928 |  So well done today, well done.
[13604.18 - 13606.18] P:1528.34 E:0.041853 |  What was that like to be involved in it?
[13606.18 - 13608.18] P:1534.24 E:0.042926 |  No, obviously, it was a
[13608.18 - 13610.18] P:1279.32 E:0.048362 |  magnificent atmosphere.
[13610.18 - 13612.18] P:1458.11 E:0.050824 |  First and foremost, brilliant to get the crowds back in.
[13612.18 - 13614.18] P:1406.21 E:0.061281 |  That felt like proper football.
[13614.18 - 13616.18] P:1612.49 E:0.058109 |  Something else, wasn't it?
[13616.18 - 13618.18] P:1571.42 E:0.063488 |  Yeah, it felt like proper football.
[13618.18 - 13620.18] P:1282.05 E:0.039578 |  Obviously, the group games we had, 20,000,
[13620.18 - 13622.18] P:1397.09 E:0.065996 |  but I think we missed the band as well,
[13622.18 - 13624.18] P:1223.03 E:0.043832 |  to be honest, when the band's in it,
[13624.18 - 13626.18] P:1667.36 E:0.057942 |  the atmosphere seems to pick up with England.
[13626.18 - 13628.18] P:1530.77 E:0.055093 |  No, it's magnificent to get a full...
[13628.34 - 13630.34] P:1369.54 E:0.057486 |  I know it wasn't, but it's been a tough couple of years
[13630.34 - 13632.34] P:1286.51 E:0.053595 |  for everyone involved in this country.
[13632.34 - 13634.34] P:1378.53 E:0.043858 |  So we knew, coming out today,
[13634.34 - 13636.34] P:1520.95 E:0.063406 |  it was our moment.
[13636.34 - 13638.34] P:1246.14 E:0.054722 |  We had to put smiles on everyone's faces back home,
[13638.34 - 13640.34] P:1460.37 E:0.055770 |  everyone in the stadium,
[13640.34 - 13642.34] P:1262.46 E:0.050192 |  and I'm just so grateful that we managed to do that.
[13642.34 - 13644.34] P:1354.27 E:0.058131 |  Tough game, wasn't it?
[13644.34 - 13646.34] P:1436.96 E:0.067053 |  You feel you deserved it, though?
[13646.34 - 13648.34] P:1418.77 E:0.056384 |  Yeah, I felt that we deserved the victory.
[13648.34 - 13650.34] P:1678.58 E:0.056756 |  We knew it was going to be a tough game,
[13650.34 - 13652.34] P:1406.75 E:0.056140 |  first and foremost, they're a top team.
[13652.34 - 13654.34] P:1324.57 E:0.049304 |  We kept hearing things about
[13654.34 - 13656.34] P:1509.29 E:0.068770 |  they're not as good as they used to be,
[13656.50 - 13658.50] P:1478.77 E:0.047765 |  but they're a top team.
[13658.50 - 13660.50] P:1339.63 E:0.058890 |  They'll bounce back, and I'm sure they will,
[13660.50 - 13662.50] P:1587.19 E:0.054634 |  but they have great players, great structure.
[13662.50 - 13664.50] P:1533.24 E:0.056138 |  We've obviously changed our formation
[13664.50 - 13666.50] P:1431.06 E:0.057934 |  to match them up and try to be really aggressive
[13666.50 - 13668.50] P:1558.12 E:0.056657 |  out of the ball and go man for man as much as we can.
[13668.50 - 13670.50] P:1336.20 E:0.057711 |  I felt like that worked.
[13670.50 - 13672.50] P:1590.16 E:0.062447 |  We didn't give them any river more settle in the game.
[13672.50 - 13674.50] P:1467.95 E:0.053523 |  And yeah, I felt like...
[13674.50 - 13676.50] P:1504.48 E:0.049347 |  I felt like the large majority of the game
[13676.50 - 13678.50] P:1520.69 E:0.059174 |  was in control of the game,
[13678.50 - 13680.50] P:1383.50 E:0.055917 |  and we know that we've got match winners in our team,
[13680.50 - 13682.50] P:1326.62 E:0.047601 |  and it's proven again.
[13682.50 - 13684.50] P:1548.95 E:0.070657 |  There have been a few mounds.
[13684.66 - 13686.66] P:1401.78 E:0.061520 |  I'm sure everyone will have a good night tonight.
[13686.66 - 13688.66] P:1554.23 E:0.046264 |  I'm sure every table in the pub will be busy.
[13688.66 - 13690.66] P:1337.32 E:0.032224 |  So, no, listen,
[13690.66 - 13692.66] P:1626.22 E:0.062923 |  we want to win football matches.
[13692.66 - 13694.66] P:1240.09 E:0.046538 |  It's tournament football.
[13694.66 - 13696.66] P:1321.70 E:0.057422 |  You see how, what happens with the results yesterday,
[13696.66 - 13698.66] P:1634.00 E:0.057849 |  it's tough to win football matches at this level.
[13698.66 - 13700.66] P:1152.82 E:0.049312 |  And at the moment, we're doing it really well.
[13700.66 - 13702.66] P:1387.99 E:0.048719 |  But listen, it's just a start.
[13702.66 - 13704.66] P:1300.82 E:0.042686 |  We've got to carry on.
[13704.66 - 13706.66] P:1445.92 E:0.067569 |  We've got to continue.
[13706.66 - 13708.66] P:1604.78 E:0.056032 |  We've got to keep going.
[13708.66 - 13710.66] P:1414.90 E:0.055653 |  We've got to keep going.
[13710.66 - 13712.66] P:1624.63 E:0.060131 |  We've got to keep going.
[13712.82 - 13714.82] P:1267.65 E:0.060411 |  We've got to start. We've got to carry on.
[13714.82 - 13716.82] P:1567.75 E:0.054612 |  We've got to continue.
[13716.82 - 13718.82] P:1250.38 E:0.047044 |  Another big game on Saturday.
[13718.82 - 13720.82] P:1341.52 E:0.044375 |  We don't rest, we cover and prepare well.
[13720.82 - 13722.82] P:1519.32 E:0.059679 |  It's going to be another tough test.
[13722.82 - 13724.82] P:1603.83 E:0.062099 |  We know that, and we have to be right at our level
[13724.82 - 13726.82] P:1288.48 E:0.058128 |  to make sure that we win that game on Saturday.
[13726.82 - 13728.82] P:1597.94 E:0.057871 |  Lovely. Thanks, Harry.
[13728.82 - 13730.82] P:1524.95 E:0.038344 |  We heard you perfectly today, so thanks very much.
[13730.82 - 13732.82] P:1747.16 E:0.073465 |  Thank you, Jon.
[13732.82 - 13734.82] P:1645.45 E:0.067576 |  We'll get more reaction.
[13734.82 - 13736.82] P:1884.20 E:0.064299 |  Will it be Harry Maguire again, Jon,
[13736.82 - 13738.82] P:1799.50 E:0.057306 |  or are you going to get someone different in the bar?
[13738.82 - 13740.82] P:1480.27 E:0.040294 |  Oh, well, I'm going to keep it as a surprise.
[13740.98 - 13742.98] P:1425.65 E:0.066976 |  Maybe we will.
[13742.98 - 13744.98] P:1387.12 E:0.075995 |  Excellent.
[13744.98 - 13746.98] P:1492.27 E:0.065068 |  Maybe we will.
[13746.98 - 13748.98] P:1800.70 E:0.076405 |  Karin, you still pitch like for us
[13748.98 - 13750.98] P:1854.41 E:0.081560 |  as the lawn mowers go up and down.
[13750.98 - 13752.98] P:1794.80 E:0.040813 |  I can't do it.
[13752.98 - 13754.98] P:1739.74 E:0.054082 |  Tournament management, game management.
[13754.98 - 13756.98] P:1868.79 E:0.063722 |  I mean, England have said this all the way through the tournament.
[13756.98 - 13758.98] P:1769.62 E:0.057637 |  I can't do it.
[13758.98 - 13760.98] P:1858.11 E:0.071803 |  We may want them to be hitting three goals
[13760.98 - 13762.98] P:1837.29 E:0.062407 |  like France or five goals like Spain,
[13762.98 - 13764.98] P:1904.95 E:0.061933 |  but it's how they manage themselves
[13764.98 - 13766.98] P:1808.22 E:0.052109 |  through this tournament,
[13766.98 - 13768.98] P:2181.24 E:0.065012 |  and you can answer that.
[13769.14 - 13771.14] P:1794.35 E:0.056972 |  After we go down to John Murray
[13771.14 - 13773.14] P:1904.02 E:0.052770 |  for his latest surprise.
[13773.14 - 13775.14] P:1796.93 E:0.056933 |  Yeah, and the latest surprise is...
[13775.14 - 13777.14] P:1505.85 E:0.046190 |  No, it's not Harry Maguire.
[13777.14 - 13779.14] P:1513.27 E:0.047953 |  It's Declan Rice.
[13779.14 - 13782.14] P:1467.07 E:0.059851 |  Declan, last time I spoke to you in this very position,
[13782.14 - 13784.14] P:1510.13 E:0.056286 |  you were looking, do you remember,
[13784.14 - 13786.14] P:1542.58 E:0.059192 |  rather downcast after the Scotland game?
[13786.14 - 13788.14] P:1574.73 E:0.068024 |  Different today.
[13788.14 - 13790.14] P:1512.35 E:0.063957 |  Yeah.
[13790.14 - 13792.14] P:1259.55 E:0.034938 |  You can see on my face, I'm delighted.
[13792.14 - 13794.14] P:1391.21 E:0.049411 |  I'm so happy to a man today.
[13794.14 - 13796.14] P:1368.94 E:0.049438 |  Everyone ran their socks off,
[13796.14 - 13798.14] P:1280.07 E:0.055567 |  and I'm so happy to see that.
[13798.30 - 13800.30] P:1208.75 E:0.048807 |  I'm so happy to see that.
[13800.30 - 13802.30] P:1267.29 E:0.055162 |  I remember the first time we went off,
[13802.30 - 13804.30] P:1350.52 E:0.056164 |  and in the end, we was never going home today.
[13804.30 - 13806.30] P:1251.57 E:0.047272 |  We was never coming off this pitch without winning...
[13806.30 - 13808.30] P:1455.42 E:0.045758 |  without winning this game of football,
[13808.30 - 13810.30] P:1513.33 E:0.068262 |  and you can see, we were fighting, we were blocking.
[13810.30 - 13812.30] P:1319.38 E:0.060490 |  We were making tackles, we were driving forward,
[13812.30 - 13814.30] P:1557.39 E:0.057643 |  and in the end we scored two great goals
[13814.30 - 13816.30] P:1432.41 E:0.064796 |  and managed to hold on for our fourth clean sheet in a row.
[13816.30 - 13818.30] P:1445.25 E:0.069157 |  Hm.
[13818.30 - 13820.30] P:1446.08 E:0.061256 |  Before the game, we were sitting over on that far side,
[13820.30 - 13822.30] P:1462.53 E:0.068171 |  and you came running out towards us.
[13822.30 - 13824.30] P:1168.84 E:0.064325 |  Big smile on your face.
[13824.30 - 13826.30] P:1508.74 E:0.070570 |  You're waving up to that far side of the stand.
[13826.30 - 13828.30] P:1561.19 E:0.052612 |  running along the beach?
[13828.30 - 13833.30] P:1467.61 E:0.056365 |  It's because my fellow skipper Mark Noble was up there with James Calden.
[13833.30 - 13838.30] P:1572.86 E:0.054011 |  James is a big Westam fan, so he's in the box with Nobbs and I could see Nobbs' kid, Lenny,
[13838.30 - 13841.30] P:1445.13 E:0.057014 |  so I was buzzing to see them, really made me happy.
[13841.30 - 13847.30] P:1229.07 E:0.050548 |  I can tell you now today, I think it was the most composed I'd probably been,
[13847.30 - 13849.30] P:1470.88 E:0.065182 |  more composed than the group stage games, and today was a bigger game.
[13849.30 - 13852.30] P:1398.24 E:0.058715 |  I just knew it was a game of football, had to go out there,
[13852.30 - 13856.30] P:1339.29 E:0.053781 |  and if we imposed our game on them and really showed what we could do,
[13856.30 - 13858.30] P:1344.78 E:0.038126 |  we could come out on top.
[13858.30 - 13863.30] P:1595.07 E:0.066087 |  And again, you've had some real midfield confrontations in this tournament, haven't you?
[13863.30 - 13869.30] P:1486.60 E:0.061801 |  And there in Gretzger and Kroos, that's high quality you and Calvin were up against, wasn't it?
[13869.30 - 13875.30] P:1431.40 E:0.047592 |  Yeah, I think with me and Calvin, people are always going to write us off.
[13875.30 - 13880.30] P:1413.16 E:0.054973 |  I read stuff where people write us off and say we're not good enough to be playing at this level.
[13880.30 - 13884.30] P:1528.41 E:0.057182 |  You see today we are. Maybe against Scotland we weren't at our best,
[13884.30 - 13888.30] P:1379.44 E:0.056395 |  but we parked them in performances to decide and I think that's part of being a top player.
[13888.30 - 13891.30] P:1467.17 E:0.057295 |  You have to move on, you have to be mentally strong, and you have to go out there
[13891.30 - 13895.30] P:1508.25 E:0.056984 |  and keep putting in performance after performance, and just head to Calvary after the game,
[13895.30 - 13897.30] P:1225.09 E:0.050894 |  then we need to keep going.
[13897.30 - 13900.30] P:1482.51 E:0.062578 |  There's another final on Saturday which we're about to play in
[13900.30 - 13903.30] P:1345.97 E:0.049037 |  and we need to stay fully focused and ready for what's next to come.
[13903.30 - 13909.30] P:1392.77 E:0.060108 |  And then, or Gareth Southgate always says to you about how what you do in an England shirt
[13909.30 - 13914.30] P:1358.86 E:0.062680 |  will be something that people will remember, and when you get to the end of your career,
[13914.30 - 13917.30] P:1396.49 E:0.069739 |  things you do in an England shirt will be above everything else.
[13917.30 - 13922.30] P:1446.13 E:0.057911 |  What you've just experienced there today, it's one of those moments, isn't it?
[13922.30 - 13927.30] P:1560.33 E:0.052130 |  It's history. We've been asked in press conferences all week about games in 2010,
[13927.30 - 13935.30] P:1318.31 E:0.043646 |  1996, 1966, and today was our chance to write a little bit of history and be spoken about forever.
[13935.30 - 13940.30] P:1449.01 E:0.050713 |  I think they just said to me, we're first time we knocked Germany out in a tournament since 1966,
[13940.30 - 13945.30] P:1335.34 E:0.048804 |  so what more can you say? Everyone's buzzing and I'm so happy.
[13945.30 - 13951.30] P:1492.22 E:0.048730 |  Well done Declan, speak to you again further in the tournament perhaps, Declan Rice.
[13951.30 - 13954.30] P:1462.43 E:0.047653 |  That was a great interview, wasn't it?
[13954.30 - 13958.30] P:1671.46 E:0.058998 |  He speaks well, does Declan Rice, you know what I mean?
[13958.30 - 13961.30] P:1838.84 E:0.049322 |  He mentioned the people in the crowd as well, Gordon.
[13961.30 - 13965.30] P:1983.89 E:0.036763 |  I'm just happy to see Gordon, but you know, even speaking facts,
[13965.30 - 13971.30] P:1971.27 E:0.041339 |  I don't want to get over excited because England thoroughly deserved the win today,
[13971.30 - 13979.30] P:1840.46 E:0.038529 |  but they didn't do it incredibly well, but a win to win against Germany, you take it.
[13979.30 - 13985.30] P:1866.85 E:0.049410 |  Chris has made some good points in terms of, you just can't get too carried away.
[13985.30 - 13992.30] P:1874.35 E:0.038273 |  They've got a chance, we all know that now, but there's still something missing.
[13992.30 - 13998.30] P:1820.42 E:0.046769 |  Germany go through a couple of them chances, great to have the clean sheets,
[13998.30 - 14004.30] P:1820.88 E:0.041724 |  but if they want to win this, they've just got to step up a little bit more.
[14004.30 - 14007.30] P:1731.15 E:0.053738 |  They've got to be more clinical, they've got to move the ball quicker,
[14007.30 - 14010.30] P:1936.43 E:0.053175 |  but more confidence, it's more confidence in the middle.
[14010.30 - 14015.30] P:1947.96 E:0.055603 |  If they get over the half wheeling, be more positive, more runs, better passes,
[14015.30 - 14018.30] P:2028.70 E:0.045266 |  earlier passes, don't be afraid to put balls in the box.
[14018.30 - 14021.30] P:1817.88 E:0.064931 |  You're getting great positions, the wingbacks are tamed,
[14021.30 - 14024.30] P:1850.83 E:0.057036 |  or whoever, Jack comes on and puts the ball in straight when we score,
[14024.30 - 14027.30] P:1915.33 E:0.044980 |  but don't be afraid to put it in there.
[14027.30 - 14030.30] P:1982.18 E:0.056541 |  You've got a fair chance, it's 50-50 when it's going in there,
[14030.30 - 14035.30] P:1796.84 E:0.054640 |  so you just let them be a little bit more positive when they have the ball,
[14035.30 - 14039.30] P:1863.63 E:0.055142 |  but there's spells still, I've got to say what, where England play,
[14039.30 - 14044.30] P:1756.28 E:0.050085 |  and they have 10-15 minutes of spell where the other team absolutely dominate them.
[14044.30 - 14049.30] P:1888.21 E:0.060164 |  I mean dominate, you've got to somehow know how to step up a little bit,
[14049.30 - 14054.30] P:1761.01 E:0.045741 |  and then when you get your breather, still get the ball back a bit more and look after it.
[14054.30 - 14060.30] P:1754.71 E:0.047865 |  This is a rare day, days like this do not come along very often,
[14060.30 - 14064.30] P:1775.39 E:0.055875 |  in the Netherlands and Germany, and Mike has tried not to get overexcited.
[14064.30 - 14068.30] P:1702.45 E:0.056203 |  I mean that very rarely happens with you.
[14068.30 - 14071.30] P:1766.97 E:0.060282 |  You know why, because we're true contenders now.
[14071.30 - 14074.30] P:1754.81 E:0.054937 |  This is why you get the level head-out.
[14074.30 - 14078.30] P:1553.51 E:0.053369 |  I think looking at this tournament, there's nobody that scares me.
[14078.30 - 14082.30] P:1667.46 E:0.045907 |  We said yesterday on Match of the Day 2,
[14082.30 - 14086.30] P:1584.97 E:0.055184 |  the Highlights program as we're calling it in this tournament.
[14086.30 - 14089.30] P:1776.07 E:0.051341 |  There's no one in this competition I really fear.
[14089.30 - 14091.30] P:1764.67 E:0.057884 |  If we beat Germany, and we've done that today,
[14091.30 - 14094.30] P:1657.48 E:0.046655 |  the boys deserve immense credit for that.
[14094.30 - 14099.30] P:1742.94 E:0.055842 |  I don't fear anyone else that they really could do it, but they've got to believe.
[14099.30 - 14103.30] P:1845.32 E:0.045335 |  Do you not think that Mike could go either way, if they play as somebody else?
[14103.30 - 14107.30] P:1918.78 E:0.045755 |  If they get the chances of Germany, they could be 2-0 up or 2-1 up.
[14107.30 - 14110.30] P:1882.52 E:0.056254 |  Then you're chasing the game where you leave gaps and you get exploded.
[14110.30 - 14114.30] P:1886.01 E:0.056774 |  What you've got to think is, if I had clean sheet, clean sheet, clean sheet, clean sheet,
[14114.30 - 14117.30] P:1811.91 E:0.051038 |  so now you get the first goal, they think, we're getting clean sheet,
[14117.30 - 14119.30] P:1942.64 E:0.052339 |  that team's got to come out and shoot us.
[14119.30 - 14121.30] P:1887.90 E:0.064324 |  That's how the tournament's going with a lot of teams.
[14121.30 - 14125.30] P:1855.69 E:0.046671 |  A lot of teams, I think, get the first goal, because then teams have to come out with,
[14125.30 - 14128.30] P:1902.63 E:0.052098 |  and we pick them off. That's the way a lot of these teams are set up,
[14128.30 - 14131.30] P:1890.95 E:0.036238 |  where England keeps getting the first goal.
[14131.30 - 14136.30] P:1793.23 E:0.056654 |  But what you're saying there isn't a dig at England, that is the nature of...
[14136.30 - 14138.30] P:1703.12 E:0.039080 |  Can't hear me.
[14138.30 - 14140.30] P:1807.22 E:0.055118 |  You can now, go on.
[14140.30 - 14143.30] P:1702.73 E:0.052823 |  That isn't a... Can you hear me now?
[14143.30 - 14148.30] P:1795.16 E:0.061460 |  But what you're saying there isn't a dig at England, that's the nature of this tournament.
[14148.30 - 14151.30] P:1830.49 E:0.073132 |  Every single game could have gone either way, really.
[14151.30 - 14155.30] P:1775.45 E:0.057043 |  Every team's the same. There's not one team dominant in this competition,
[14155.30 - 14157.30] P:1876.26 E:0.052940 |  where you actually think they're all the way.
[14157.30 - 14160.30] P:1743.85 E:0.067259 |  I mean, look, Belgium won the 1-0, Portugal had all the ball.
[14162.30 - 14165.30] P:1837.77 E:0.061535 |  Italy could have lost to Austria. I mean, they could, couldn't they?
[14165.30 - 14167.30] P:1597.06 E:0.058730 |  Yeah, they could have.
[14167.30 - 14170.30] P:1739.72 E:0.059831 |  Let's go back to Ciaran. We think we might get Harry Kane, surely.
[14170.30 - 14173.30] P:1948.98 E:0.064348 |  I'm just watching a few England players that go along during the post-match interview.
[14173.30 - 14176.30] P:1854.08 E:0.066730 |  So, Ciaran, when we went to Declan Rise,
[14176.30 - 14179.30] P:1901.45 E:0.052006 |  we'd left you with the question about...
[14179.30 - 14182.30] P:1715.22 E:0.061600 |  Harry McGuire had said, talking about tournament football,
[14182.30 - 14185.30] P:1808.42 E:0.055399 |  managing the tournament, managing each game.
[14185.30 - 14188.30] P:1615.88 E:0.052863 |  Yeah, they've done it unbelievably well.
[14188.30 - 14191.30] P:1775.50 E:0.059829 |  I listened to you up there, and I hear...
[14191.30 - 14193.30] P:1635.35 E:0.062770 |  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[14193.30 - 14197.30] P:1732.75 E:0.060527 |  It might be that Harry Kane, sorry, is going to talk to Jor.
[14197.30 - 14199.30] P:1813.11 E:0.069245 |  Harry Kane's first.
[14199.30 - 14202.30] P:1675.61 E:0.075959 |  Yeah, we'll get this answer out, Ciaran.
[14202.30 - 14205.30] P:1683.24 E:0.073740 |  I promise you, we will. Harry Kane with John Murray live.
[14205.30 - 14208.30] P:1535.95 E:0.056150 |  Yes, here he is. Harry Kane, the England captain.
[14208.30 - 14211.30] P:1587.01 E:0.071811 |  On the score sheet at the Euros, I know you've been along the line, Harry.
[14211.30 - 14214.30] P:1779.85 E:0.061407 |  Just going to ask you two questions, because I don't want to keep you for too long.
[14214.30 - 14218.30] P:1670.51 E:0.062917 |  You've got a big smile on your face. Goal-scoring, Harry Kane is back.
[14218.30 - 14222.30] P:1656.89 E:0.062079 |  Yeah, now, incredible, incredible day, incredible afternoon for us, you know.
[14222.30 - 14226.30] P:1657.05 E:0.057852 |  So much build-up for this game, obviously a lot of pressure, a lot of expectation.
[14226.30 - 14230.30] P:1581.29 E:0.053149 |  So, to be able to perform like that, as we did as a team, in front of this crowd,
[14230.30 - 14234.30] P:1555.95 E:0.057236 |  to see Wembley as it was bouncing, and people falling off their seats,
[14234.30 - 14237.30] P:1624.24 E:0.063225 |  and it's just a moment none of us will ever forget.
[14237.30 - 14240.30] P:1511.37 E:0.060461 |  Everyone in the stadium, all the players, the staff, the nation,
[14240.30 - 14244.30] P:1526.64 E:0.049537 |  it's a big, big moment for us, but we know we've got a long way to go,
[14244.30 - 14246.30] P:1779.68 E:0.068308 |  and it's all about it, so we can't get too carried away.
[14246.30 - 14249.30] P:1500.57 E:0.050779 |  We'll enjoy it, of course, but then we focus straight on to Saturday.
[14249.30 - 14254.30] P:1409.11 E:0.057974 |  However, is it fair to say that you've never felt like that before in a football shirt?
[14254.30 - 14258.30] P:1706.13 E:0.059200 |  No, that was for sure, that was one of the best feelings I've ever had in my life.
[14258.30 - 14262.30] P:1584.01 E:0.055367 |  Yeah, you was here, you witnessed it, just to see everyone off their seats,
[14262.30 - 14264.30] P:1418.13 E:0.062243 |  and my friends and family there.
[14264.30 - 14268.30] P:1618.37 E:0.048244 |  It was just incredible, it's what you dream about as a kid,
[14268.30 - 14272.30] P:1570.73 E:0.059596 |  when you're growing up, scoring up Wembley in a knockout against a big nation like Germany.
[14272.30 - 14278.30] P:1439.38 E:0.057376 |  It's what it's all about, so amazing day, a day we will all never forget,
[14278.30 - 14282.30] P:1568.66 E:0.055532 |  but let's turn our attention onto Saturday now, because we don't want to make it worthless,
[14282.30 - 14285.30] P:1642.93 E:0.058305 |  we want to make sure that we take advantage of that, self-believe,
[14285.30 - 14287.30] P:1267.19 E:0.045374 |  and take that into the games ahead.
[14287.30 - 14289.30] P:1412.19 E:0.060894 |  That's my two questions, Harry. Thank you very much.
[14290.30 - 14292.30] P:1671.91 E:0.033325 |  Harry Kane.
[14292.30 - 14295.30] P:1761.11 E:0.070129 |  For goodness sake, Karen, get this answer out, will you? Come on.
[14295.30 - 14297.30] P:1736.84 E:0.067969 |  It's probably not even worth it now.
[14297.30 - 14299.30] P:1760.92 E:0.084009 |  Let's move on anyhow.
[14299.30 - 14302.30] P:1781.42 E:0.067830 |  Safe Gates coming out, look.
[14304.30 - 14307.30] P:1868.17 E:0.074330 |  He's not with John quite yet, so you're all right.
[14307.30 - 14311.30] P:1683.95 E:0.057086 |  I forgot even what you asked now, tournament football.
[14311.30 - 14316.30] P:1915.96 E:0.066741 |  I was listening to you guys, we've won 2-0, we beat Germany 2-0,
[14316.30 - 14319.30] P:1852.97 E:0.062671 |  you're asking about tournament management, we're getting it done.
[14319.30 - 14323.30] P:1753.04 E:0.055586 |  I said it all along, I said it last week, it's not going to be pretty with England,
[14323.30 - 14326.30] P:1768.10 E:0.067644 |  but they're just going to manage it, clean sheet mentality,
[14326.30 - 14328.30] P:1704.35 E:0.063578 |  that's what they're going to do, keep it in, keep it in,
[14328.30 - 14330.30] P:1643.33 E:0.050357 |  and bring on the Super Subs to win the game.
[14330.30 - 14334.30] P:1681.96 E:0.056473 |  It isn't going to be like Spain, Tiki Taka, and all this night,
[14334.30 - 14337.30] P:1910.20 E:0.066279 |  we're going to do it our way, and it's going to be about game plan, game strategy,
[14337.30 - 14341.30] P:1736.48 E:0.057635 |  and bringing on the Subs at the right time, and we're doing it well,
[14341.30 - 14344.30] P:1590.47 E:0.053169 |  and I think they're, like you said, every game is a final,
[14344.30 - 14347.30] P:1574.43 E:0.061187 |  they've got to prepare for the next one, but what I like in interviews is,
[14347.30 - 14350.30] P:1627.42 E:0.059393 |  I hear a mentality, they've learned from that World Cup,
[14350.30 - 14354.30] P:1755.88 E:0.050273 |  they're not losing, Declan Rice, wow.
[14354.30 - 14358.30] P:1717.34 E:0.057559 |  In the past, probably like five years ago, we'd say that would be arrogance,
[14358.30 - 14361.30] P:1674.00 E:0.056404 |  now that's brilliant confidence, that's a winning mentality,
[14361.30 - 14365.30] P:1744.19 E:0.055432 |  you know, Harry Kane, next game Saturday, that's the type of mentality that we need,
[14365.30 - 14368.30] P:1715.52 E:0.062563 |  if we're going to win this tournament, because we have got such a good chance,
[14368.30 - 14372.30] P:1701.84 E:0.059743 |  clean sheets, we look solid, we look really solid,
[14372.30 - 14376.30] P:1703.88 E:0.064310 |  and Pickford is on point as well, and you need your goalkeeper to be on point
[14376.30 - 14380.30] P:1665.13 E:0.055028 |  if you're going to progress, and I just liked everything about today's performance,
[14380.30 - 14381.30] P:1663.37 E:0.038883 |  it was fantastic.
[14381.30 - 14388.30] P:1691.88 E:0.055355 |  I just think, Karen, there's a balance, isn't there, because you revel in 2-0
[14388.30 - 14392.30] P:1834.75 E:0.058250 |  and beating Germany, because it hasn't happened for England in the knockout stages
[14392.30 - 14400.30] P:1866.48 E:0.058287 |  against Germany since 1966, so there's a natural elation at beating a great rival
[14400.30 - 14406.30] P:1863.98 E:0.059882 |  for the first time at this stage for a very, very long time, coupled with 45,000
[14406.30 - 14412.30] P:1788.04 E:0.057879 |  in Wembley, that whole release of having a big crowd back and everybody feeding off that,
[14412.30 - 14418.30] P:1826.58 E:0.052214 |  but at the same time, recognising this is a tournament, and it's only the last 16,
[14418.30 - 14425.30] P:1835.17 E:0.055708 |  and these guys are setting our ambitions much higher than that, so trying to manage
[14425.30 - 14432.30] P:1826.06 E:0.053344 |  the realism and the unbridled joy, that's the path we're all trying to tread this evening.
[14432.30 - 14437.30] P:1812.60 E:0.061249 |  From being in loads of tournaments, when you have these moments, you do have to enjoy it,
[14437.30 - 14443.30] P:1786.92 E:0.057519 |  enjoy today as a player, as a fan, and everyone is, and tomorrow is where you start again,
[14443.30 - 14449.30] P:1794.05 E:0.055582 |  your recovery, and what I notice about that is we are travelling now, this is the first time we're travelling,
[14450.30 - 14456.30] P:1667.68 E:0.052476 |  there was a lot of fatigue, this is where now it really is important that the England players,
[14456.30 - 14462.30] P:1662.54 E:0.060266 |  recovery saw Declan Rice getting cramped, there was a lot of people getting carb jails on the side,
[14462.30 - 14465.30] P:1688.40 E:0.061024 |  the tournament is progressing, and part of their DNA, I spoke to someone actually,
[14465.30 - 14471.30] P:1664.15 E:0.059095 |  they said about keeping players fit, they have to keep us, that's a real big thing for their medical department,
[14471.30 - 14475.30] P:1701.63 E:0.061603 |  the England team, is keeping everybody fit and making sure that everyone is available
[14475.30 - 14479.30] P:1516.27 E:0.051857 |  to give them the best chance to progress, so it's the first time they're travelling,
[14479.30 - 14485.30] P:1796.42 E:0.055422 |  it is important now that they regroup and recover and enjoy this moment because it's history,
[14485.30 - 14491.30] P:1580.52 E:0.053648 |  it's very rare, so, but tomorrow morning we park it, you move on, what's the game plan,
[14491.30 - 14493.30] P:1830.22 E:0.050829 |  what's the strategy for Saturday?
[14495.30 - 14504.30] P:1769.73 E:0.058279 |  For the moment, Karen, thank you, let's hear from Jack Grealish, now he's been talking to Kelly Sons.
[14504.30 - 14508.30] P:1458.26 E:0.069534 |  Jack, we heard the fans cheering your name for you to come on in that second half,
[14508.30 - 14511.30] P:1514.66 E:0.068895 |  you came on and played a key role, how much did you enjoy out there?
[14511.30 - 14518.30] P:1377.37 E:0.067056 |  Yeah, no, I loved it, it's always nice, when the fans are calling your name,
[14518.30 - 14524.30] P:1339.64 E:0.067817 |  it's not about me, it's about the team, I just come on and try to create,
[14524.30 - 14529.30] P:1304.02 E:0.064936 |  and obviously I come on and played a part in the first goal and then got the assist for the second,
[14529.30 - 14536.30] P:1311.55 E:0.063938 |  I think it was a good performance for myself, even at the start I was slipping all over the place actually,
[14536.30 - 14539.30] P:1232.94 E:0.067974 |  but yeah, in the end it ended well.
[14539.30 - 14542.30] P:1311.56 E:0.064223 |  What was the message from the manager when he sent you on?
[14542.30 - 14547.30] P:1540.78 E:0.070442 |  No, he just told me to go on and express myself and played the way I usually do,
[14547.30 - 14554.30] P:1422.62 E:0.065437 |  with a smile on my face, so I went and done that, and luckily for me I created one of the goals.
[14554.30 - 14558.30] P:1391.01 E:0.063481 |  There's been a lot said about the service, or the lack of service at times for Harry Kane,
[14558.30 - 14562.30] P:1438.65 E:0.066003 |  was that something you identified, do you feel like you could be the man to put the goals on a plate for him?
[14562.30 - 14571.30] P:1281.77 E:0.066145 |  I don't know, it's tough to say, I think this Euros has been different I think to many before,
[14571.30 - 14578.30] P:1293.65 E:0.063685 |  I think there's so much tactical stuff going on, that it's hard for H,
[14578.30 - 14583.30] P:1394.27 E:0.061446 |  because he's probably our most talked about player, probably our best player,
[14583.30 - 14589.30] P:1355.77 E:0.069284 |  it's difficult because teams are going to double up on him and try and get him out of the game,
[14589.30 - 14595.30] P:1309.79 E:0.064919 |  so I don't think it's anyone's fault really in particular, but when the game opened up at the end,
[14595.30 - 14601.30] P:1449.79 E:0.067720 |  as soon as Luke gave me the ball I was actually going to shoot, I was going to bring it onto my left foot and shoot,
[14601.30 - 14605.30] P:1224.63 E:0.064410 |  but I seen H in the box, so I crossed it for him.
[14605.30 - 14608.30] P:1241.61 E:0.065838 |  You said there that Harry's one of your most talked about players,
[14608.30 - 14612.30] P:1288.13 E:0.064120 |  but you're rapidly becoming one of the most talked about players, how are you dealing with all of that?
[14612.30 - 14620.30] P:1249.16 E:0.066134 |  No, I love it, it's part of the game and if you're getting talked about, you're obviously doing some well,
[14620.30 - 14629.30] P:1259.53 E:0.066181 |  so I just took it in my stride and it was an unbelievable feeling to come here today.
[14629.30 - 14637.30] P:1379.97 E:0.066130 |  I have the fans singing my name, I've said to you before that it's weird because I usually have these fans booing me,
[14637.30 - 14642.30] P:1402.26 E:0.067898 |  but when they're cheering me like this and singing my song, there's nothing more than I want to do,
[14642.30 - 14647.30] P:1434.29 E:0.055472 |  then pay them back with goals and assists, so hopefully my goal will come soon.
[14647.30 - 14654.30] P:1882.68 E:0.047896 |  He's relishing it, isn't he, Mike? It sounds like there's no pressure on him.
[14654.30 - 14657.30] P:1828.93 E:0.059463 |  Hang on, let me ask Chris because Mike is having a season fit.
[14657.30 - 14662.30] P:1692.24 E:0.055427 |  He's relishing it, isn't he, Jack Greenish? It sounds like he's got no pressure on him.
[14662.30 - 14666.30] P:1857.53 E:0.061792 |  He's a fan's favourite, he's a crow, he's technically very gifted,
[14666.30 - 14669.30] P:1811.52 E:0.051016 |  and he'll be wondering why he's not playing from the start.
[14669.30 - 14673.30] P:1768.51 E:0.046539 |  If I was here, I'd be thinking, I'm not going to do it,
[14673.30 - 14677.30] P:1852.48 E:0.062061 |  he's got to start against the Czech Republic, which was a poor game in a way to come in
[14677.30 - 14680.30] P:1958.10 E:0.050270 |  because the Czech Republic was thinking we're happy with second place,
[14680.30 - 14685.30] P:1886.20 E:0.061752 |  we're not going to really push England hard, and the game sort of died away,
[14685.30 - 14689.30] P:1857.89 E:0.050963 |  but today, if he devastated, he probably didn't start, and he's more un-mined,
[14689.30 - 14691.30] P:1820.96 E:0.063182 |  but he's come on a main impact again.
[14691.30 - 14696.30] P:1819.05 E:0.052753 |  Now you go to Rome, to Sweden or whoever, and to Ukraine,
[14696.30 - 14698.30] P:1803.01 E:0.054502 |  and you think, do I start them? Do I start them?
[14698.30 - 14701.30] P:1836.93 E:0.039401 |  Because we need quality in the final third.
[14701.30 - 14703.30] P:1886.23 E:0.040935 |  Yeah, I'd agree with Chris.
[14703.30 - 14707.30] P:1736.99 E:0.052126 |  I think with Jack Greenish, I know we talk about the Jack Greenish fan club,
[14707.30 - 14711.30] P:1846.97 E:0.046736 |  and we have a bit of fun with it, but it's just genuine quality.
[14711.30 - 14717.30] P:1740.62 E:0.047759 |  Every time he plays, even for the first goal that Shaw puts across,
[14717.30 - 14719.30] P:1795.49 E:0.043358 |  he's occupying players.
[14719.30 - 14724.30] P:1794.48 E:0.047815 |  When he gets on the ball, he occupies one, two, even three players,
[14724.30 - 14728.30] P:1784.69 E:0.053569 |  and although he might not get direct the assist, he's involved
[14728.30 - 14732.30] P:1808.32 E:0.046693 |  because players have to move out of the spaces that they were in,
[14732.30 - 14736.30] P:1699.11 E:0.036124 |  so Jack Greenish is a fantastic player.
[14736.30 - 14741.30] P:1861.56 E:0.052856 |  I do wish he didn't get more time, but I can't question South,
[14741.30 - 14744.30] P:1928.67 E:0.055604 |  get up to now, he got four clean sheets, the beat Germany.
[14744.30 - 14751.30] P:1785.93 E:0.041862 |  Yes, I would like to be more expansive, but up to now, it's worked.
[14751.30 - 14756.30] P:1705.16 E:0.043365 |  But I think I have to agree with Chris on the fact that in terms of,
[14756.30 - 14759.30] P:1607.53 E:0.056751 |  he deserves a place in this 11 now.
[14759.30 - 14762.30] P:1721.73 E:0.056972 |  While things have gone OK and he's winning, it seems all right,
[14762.30 - 14764.30] P:1619.64 E:0.050599 |  but we shouldn't have to be keeping...
[14764.30 - 14767.30] P:1769.31 E:0.052426 |  We bring him on the Scotland game for the last 20 minutes.
[14767.30 - 14770.30] P:1745.19 E:0.056548 |  Chris mentioned the Czech game where it's a nothing game, really,
[14770.30 - 14773.30] P:1742.58 E:0.061791 |  they're already through, and then they're bringing on here
[14773.30 - 14775.30] P:1841.86 E:0.056245 |  where he's got to come on and change the game.
[14775.30 - 14778.30] P:1668.48 E:0.053145 |  I think now he deserves a place in this England side.
[14778.30 - 14781.30] P:1660.95 E:0.061064 |  A lot of people are talking about he doesn't work hard enough,
[14781.30 - 14783.30] P:1784.62 E:0.045328 |  but if you actually look at his stats,
[14783.30 - 14786.30] P:1854.07 E:0.056008 |  Aston Villa is one of the hardest working effects of game.
[14786.30 - 14789.30] P:1817.72 E:0.051378 |  He creates the most chances, and it's not by fluke,
[14789.30 - 14792.30] P:1840.99 E:0.049855 |  so if I had my way, he'd be starting.
[14792.30 - 14797.30] P:1947.06 E:0.053114 |  So it strikes me, Karen, that there are only two places
[14797.30 - 14801.30] P:1744.29 E:0.052454 |  that are up for grabs, really, in this England side.
[14801.30 - 14805.30] P:1765.71 E:0.055568 |  If England play with a back four, they may choose to stay with a back three.
[14805.30 - 14809.30] P:1873.44 E:0.059377 |  Who knows, depending on who their opponents are in the quarterfinals.
[14809.30 - 14813.30] P:1780.97 E:0.056547 |  But if they stay with a back four, then you've really only got a midfielder
[14813.30 - 14815.30] P:1612.23 E:0.054403 |  alongside Ryse and Phillips,
[14815.30 - 14819.30] P:1852.66 E:0.049992 |  because you would expect Trippier to drop out if it was a back four,
[14819.30 - 14822.30] P:1753.19 E:0.055635 |  and then one place alongside Kain and Sterling.
[14822.30 - 14826.30] P:1956.35 E:0.053350 |  They're the only two places that are up for discussion, aren't they?
[14826.30 - 14829.30] P:1672.77 E:0.040541 |  Yeah, yeah, I totally agree, Chappers,
[14829.30 - 14832.30] P:1781.38 E:0.050249 |  and I totally agree with the guys there.
[14832.30 - 14834.30] P:1623.13 E:0.055528 |  I think he deserves to start now.
[14834.30 - 14837.30] P:1761.62 E:0.054345 |  I think, you know, Saka did really well.
[14837.30 - 14841.30] P:1885.83 E:0.056460 |  He started to see, and then, you know, the next teams we're going to be up against
[14841.30 - 14845.30] P:1534.40 E:0.051063 |  Sweden, Ukraine, will pose a different problem for England.
[14845.30 - 14848.30] P:1950.39 E:0.053088 |  So it might actually suit a Jack Greenish to take the ball on
[14848.30 - 14851.30] P:1815.97 E:0.060056 |  and pick it up as opposed to spacing behind, especially, you know,
[14851.30 - 14854.30] P:1753.18 E:0.067514 |  let's say we've got a Swedish team, very, very well organised.
[14854.30 - 14857.30] P:1679.16 E:0.053439 |  We're going to need ball players, could see Mount come back into the team,
[14857.30 - 14859.30] P:1746.96 E:0.059453 |  could see Greenish come back in, could be Ukraine.
[14859.30 - 14863.30] P:1797.42 E:0.054623 |  So Garasov gets said throughout this whole process about the opposition,
[14863.30 - 14865.30] P:1936.98 E:0.064595 |  they changed today because of the opposition,
[14865.30 - 14869.30] P:1861.79 E:0.059052 |  to try and give them, you know, the strengths against their weaknesses.
[14869.30 - 14873.30] P:1880.74 E:0.054501 |  So he will, I think he will start, I think he should start,
[14873.30 - 14875.30] P:1655.00 E:0.063322 |  and I'd like to see him on that left of a front free,
[14875.30 - 14878.30] P:1684.79 E:0.069504 |  and let him go into the midfield and roam and do what is best.
[14878.30 - 14881.30] P:1747.89 E:0.054092 |  And, you know, we still got Foden as well.
[14881.30 - 14883.30] P:1823.80 E:0.061319 |  We haven't mentioned him today.
[14883.30 - 14886.30] P:1688.93 E:0.045737 |  We've got a fantastic squad.
[14886.30 - 14888.30] P:1700.53 E:0.069369 |  There's the debate that's coming, Chris, isn't it?
[14888.30 - 14890.30] P:1646.02 E:0.058434 |  You know, Mount, Foden, Greenish.
[14890.30 - 14893.30] P:1875.09 E:0.062925 |  Well, it's there, Mark, it's there, but it's up to somewhere to grab it.
[14893.30 - 14895.30] P:1778.66 E:0.056113 |  You know, we've tried, Sack, we've tried Rashford,
[14895.30 - 14897.30] P:1719.41 E:0.052070 |  we haven't tried Sanchi, have we?
[14897.30 - 14900.30] P:1868.09 E:0.055242 |  You know, we've tried, Jack Greenish played as a 10.
[14900.30 - 14902.30] P:1851.27 E:0.044155 |  I think Jack Greenish is the best position,
[14902.30 - 14904.30] P:1721.68 E:0.052820 |  which is where he come on today, that left hand side.
[14904.30 - 14907.30] P:1863.42 E:0.051170 |  And, you know, we've tried players, Sack had a good game,
[14907.30 - 14909.30] P:1920.77 E:0.049156 |  but he's had a poor game today in a way.
[14909.30 - 14912.30] P:1852.45 E:0.062161 |  So there's nobody really grabbing the shirt,
[14912.30 - 14914.30] P:1838.02 E:0.055391 |  Ryan Stirland's kept in there because he's scoring.
[14914.30 - 14916.30] P:1821.06 E:0.050870 |  I wouldn't say his general play was absolutely brilliant.
[14916.30 - 14919.30] P:2000.16 E:0.053694 |  I think he's scoring, which is helping to keep him on the pitch.
[14919.30 - 14921.30] P:1963.30 E:0.046157 |  But then places are up for grabs.
[14921.30 - 14923.30] P:1954.70 E:0.041682 |  So, you know, for Garith, he can say,
[14923.30 - 14925.30] P:1861.17 E:0.066351 |  wherever, we'll play next round.
[14925.30 - 14927.30] P:1876.55 E:0.037580 |  Let's say it's Sweden, which would be difficult
[14927.30 - 14930.30] P:1878.73 E:0.067498 |  because Skani even says he's always strong and physical.
[14930.30 - 14932.30] P:1758.95 E:0.051928 |  He may say, I'm going with Jack Greenish
[14932.30 - 14934.30] P:1913.14 E:0.057594 |  because it's his time now and he's going to have the turn.
[14934.30 - 14936.30] P:1722.17 E:0.063625 |  Now, if he doesn't play well, he may not play in the next game,
[14936.30 - 14937.30] P:1695.44 E:0.053220 |  if we get through.
[14937.30 - 14940.30] P:1678.04 E:0.055144 |  Chris, I think he will go to a 4-3-3
[14940.30 - 14942.30] P:1683.87 E:0.053088 |  and I won't be surprised if he brings Mount back in
[14942.30 - 14945.30] P:1611.11 E:0.054799 |  and starts Greenish on the left-hand side.
[14945.30 - 14948.30] P:1815.56 E:0.050648 |  Karen Kearney, Micah Richards, Chris Waddle, all with us.
[14948.30 - 14950.30] P:1945.65 E:0.069876 |  We hope to hear from Garith Southgate.
[14950.30 - 14954.30] P:2045.55 E:0.058928 |  Surely been a busy sporting day on Five Life.
[14954.30 - 14956.30] P:1794.25 E:0.050080 |  Day two at Wimbledon.
[14956.30 - 14958.30] P:1710.87 E:0.056738 |  We'll round up everything that's happened there.
[14958.30 - 14961.30] P:2037.16 E:0.056727 |  Shortly, England's men winning the first one-day international
[14961.30 - 14963.30] P:1998.64 E:0.059956 |  against Sri Lanka by five wickets.
[14963.30 - 14965.30] P:1913.42 E:0.046100 |  That was very comfortable at the Riverside.
[14965.30 - 14970.30] P:1970.24 E:0.050290 |  And of course, it's been the final two last 16 games
[14970.30 - 14971.30] P:1871.81 E:0.072006 |  at Euro 2020.
[14971.30 - 14974.30] P:2092.53 E:0.052507 |  And as you're well aware, this game at Wembley
[14974.30 - 14976.30] P:1913.85 E:0.062998 |  has merely been the starter, really,
[14976.30 - 14979.30] P:1916.62 E:0.053137 |  with England beating Germany by two goals to nil,
[14979.30 - 14981.30] P:1849.68 E:0.058859 |  because the main course is at Hamden,
[14981.30 - 14985.30] P:1862.77 E:0.051328 |  Sweden against Ukraine, Ian Dennis.
[14985.30 - 14988.30] P:1898.14 E:0.044087 |  Did somebody mention main course?
[14988.30 - 14990.30] P:1728.77 E:0.064940 |  I'd already eaten.
[14990.30 - 14992.30] P:1700.01 E:0.072236 |  So there's a surprise.
[14992.30 - 14994.30] P:1809.99 E:0.062670 |  The winners of this one, of course,
[14994.30 - 14998.30] P:1884.91 E:0.073258 |  will be England's opponents in Rome on Saturday.
[14998.30 - 15002.30] P:1976.32 E:0.061044 |  And as the team used, Sweden have made one change,
[15002.30 - 15005.30] P:2004.38 E:0.064096 |  and that change is quicent dropping out,
[15005.30 - 15007.30] P:1931.37 E:0.069197 |  and Kulisewskiy coming in to replace him.
[15007.30 - 15009.30] P:1990.67 E:0.063921 |  So Olsen is in goal.
[15009.30 - 15011.30] P:2005.95 E:0.067765 |  It's a back four of Lustig, Lindelof,
[15011.30 - 15013.30] P:1963.15 E:0.057181 |  Danielsen and Orgenstern.
[15013.30 - 15016.30] P:1890.75 E:0.076741 |  You'll have Eckdalen Olsen in the centre of midfield,
[15016.30 - 15018.30] P:1972.41 E:0.061930 |  with Forsberg and Larsen out wide,
[15018.30 - 15020.30] P:1946.82 E:0.065720 |  and Izak and Kulisewskiy.
[15020.30 - 15022.30] P:1926.45 E:0.063641 |  As for Ukraine, they've made two change.
[15022.30 - 15025.30] P:1978.50 E:0.058172 |  Krystsof and Steppenenko come in.
[15025.30 - 15028.30] P:1983.81 E:0.069266 |  They've just rejigged things around in the defence.
[15028.30 - 15032.30] P:1907.17 E:0.060429 |  It's Maikalenko and Malinovsky who drop out.
[15032.30 - 15034.30] P:1959.66 E:0.057628 |  Buschand is in goal.
[15034.30 - 15036.30] P:1628.31 E:0.069460 |  Karavaev will be the right back.
[15036.30 - 15039.30] P:1863.17 E:0.061378 |  Zabarny, though, partnered by Krystsof at the heart of the defence,
[15039.30 - 15041.30] P:1890.05 E:0.062341 |  and it means that Matvyenko moves to left back.
[15041.30 - 15043.30] P:1918.92 E:0.069116 |  The three in midfield will be Zinchenko,
[15043.30 - 15045.30] P:1873.21 E:0.059911 |  Steppenenko and Sidorchuk.
[15045.30 - 15047.30] P:1860.53 E:0.065114 |  And then you'll have Yarmalenko,
[15047.30 - 15050.30] P:1767.49 E:0.050498 |  Yarmchuk and Shaparenko up front for Ukraine.
[15050.30 - 15054.30] P:1795.72 E:0.061599 |  Pat Nevin alongside Ian for this one.
[15054.30 - 15056.30] P:1875.60 E:0.058177 |  Both these sides will be thinking, won't they?
[15056.30 - 15058.30] P:1952.09 E:0.057317 |  If they can get through this,
[15058.30 - 15060.30] P:1900.63 E:0.063951 |  that they have a chance as well.
[15060.30 - 15062.30] P:1794.38 E:0.064809 |  I mean, we were talking with Chris Waddle earlier, Pat.
[15062.30 - 15066.30] P:1821.25 E:0.063176 |  Everybody left in is going to think they've got a chance
[15066.30 - 15069.30] P:1911.70 E:0.059794 |  because of the nature of how the tournament has gone.
[15069.30 - 15072.30] P:1747.65 E:0.046674 |  Well, particularly in that end of the draw.
[15072.30 - 15074.30] P:1732.26 E:0.059220 |  Really, England, Ukraine, Sweden,
[15074.30 - 15077.30] P:1523.70 E:0.064433 |  and then the winners play check in the bubble at Denmark.
[15077.30 - 15079.30] P:1700.73 E:0.059690 |  None of them are easy games.
[15079.30 - 15082.30] P:1663.15 E:0.054130 |  Obviously, we know that, but you would take that.
[15082.30 - 15084.30] P:1526.94 E:0.067318 |  Before the tournament, if you almost wrote it out
[15084.30 - 15086.30] P:1670.62 E:0.062903 |  in a kind of line, what would you like to get?
[15086.30 - 15088.30] P:1748.31 E:0.059439 |  Well, Germany was the one you would need to get past.
[15088.30 - 15092.30] P:1704.93 E:0.060574 |  So it'd be incredibly exciting for any of these teams,
[15092.30 - 15095.30] P:1719.26 E:0.057527 |  and certainly England are the favourites now from that edge.
[15095.30 - 15098.30] P:1845.45 E:0.058931 |  So, Sweden, Ukraine, coming up eight o'clock here on 5-Line
[15098.30 - 15100.30] P:1829.94 E:0.067821 |  with Ian, Dennis and Pat Nevin.
[15100.30 - 15103.30] P:1692.07 E:0.065355 |  And over on the other side of Wembley,
[15103.30 - 15106.30] P:1927.75 E:0.040055 |  Gareth Southgate is just shuffling from foot to foot,
[15106.30 - 15108.30] P:1840.05 E:0.044922 |  waiting to talk to John Murray.
[15108.30 - 15110.30] P:1423.25 E:0.040788 |  Yes, here he is.
[15110.30 - 15113.30] P:1670.03 E:0.034725 |  Gareth, very simple question.
[15113.30 - 15116.30] P:1557.15 E:0.026074 |  How are you feeling after that?
[15116.30 - 15121.30] P:1447.61 E:0.043734 |  Well, I'm so pleased to have been able to give the fans in the stadium
[15121.30 - 15123.30] P:1216.35 E:0.056683 |  an incredible afternoon,
[15123.30 - 15127.30] P:1414.25 E:0.061348 |  and I'm sure millions of listeners and millions of watchers at home.
[15127.30 - 15130.30] P:1341.95 E:0.052848 |  We know what the country's been through,
[15130.30 - 15132.30] P:1396.36 E:0.055532 |  and to be able to give them a day like today
[15132.30 - 15135.30] P:1498.26 E:0.053193 |  and a performance like that is really special.
[15135.30 - 15139.30] P:1554.79 E:0.047719 |  What swung it your way, do you feel, today?
[15139.30 - 15142.30] P:1218.49 E:0.039561 |  The players were incredible, you know,
[15142.30 - 15147.30] P:1324.59 E:0.056969 |  from right the way through the team, the guys that came on.
[15147.30 - 15151.30] P:1301.92 E:0.055786 |  You know, they were aggressive with the pressure.
[15151.30 - 15153.30] P:1447.78 E:0.065491 |  We felt that was really important.
[15153.30 - 15157.30] P:1419.89 E:0.058744 |  That's why we changed the system, not to sit back,
[15157.30 - 15159.30] P:1490.65 E:0.060182 |  but to be aggressive on their wing backs
[15159.30 - 15162.30] P:1562.33 E:0.058159 |  to make sure that all over the field we could get pressure on them.
[15162.30 - 15164.30] P:1463.96 E:0.057987 |  And then I think we used the ball better
[15164.30 - 15166.30] P:1353.45 E:0.053397 |  than we have done during the tournament,
[15166.30 - 15169.30] P:1329.45 E:0.054905 |  and the pace of Raheem and Bukhaio
[15169.30 - 15172.30] P:1380.42 E:0.051390 |  was a problem all the way through at the start.
[15172.30 - 15175.30] P:1568.12 E:0.066698 |  I asked you that last night, whether it was a quick decision,
[15175.30 - 15178.30] P:1818.32 E:0.064938 |  something that you instantly knew that you wanted to do against Germany.
[15178.30 - 15181.30] P:1537.03 E:0.067004 |  And I can understand why you were coy about it last night,
[15181.30 - 15184.30] P:1643.06 E:0.060227 |  but was it something that you were quite firm in the idea
[15184.30 - 15186.30] P:1364.12 E:0.048261 |  that you would play through at the back against Germany?
[15186.30 - 15193.30] P:1401.49 E:0.049612 |  Yeah, we knew that the tactical problem that the wing backs hike causes you.
[15193.30 - 15196.30] P:1312.15 E:0.049890 |  When you've got players who are evenly matched,
[15196.30 - 15198.30] P:1293.72 E:0.050371 |  if you give them a tactical advantage as well,
[15198.30 - 15200.30] P:1049.25 E:0.060123 |  then that's a real problem.
[15200.30 - 15204.30] P:1401.58 E:0.054048 |  And we also felt that with the ball we could cause them problems.
[15204.30 - 15209.30] P:1495.82 E:0.047619 |  And so although, of course, you're looking at it from a defending point of view,
[15209.30 - 15213.30] P:1528.42 E:0.056420 |  it was the aggressive pressure and the spaces we thought we could find
[15213.30 - 15214.30] P:1225.24 E:0.061476 |  with the ball that helped.
[15214.30 - 15217.30] P:1427.22 E:0.043875 |  And of course, we played the system in the autumn,
[15217.30 - 15220.30] P:1095.20 E:0.057502 |  partly to see how it would all work for us.
[15220.30 - 15223.30] P:1499.99 E:0.049287 |  And it meant that the players could slot into it pretty quickly this week.
[15223.30 - 15228.30] P:1547.87 E:0.053998 |  And you also gave the people what they wanted with Jack Grealish coming on
[15228.30 - 15231.30] P:1459.20 E:0.046358 |  and when he was on, that's when the goals were scored.
[15231.30 - 15232.30] P:1619.48 E:0.053862 |  He made a difference to India.
[15232.30 - 15234.30] P:1618.29 E:0.059657 |  I saw you in the centre-circle after the end of the game
[15234.30 - 15236.30] P:1247.73 E:0.066085 |  having a little bit of a laugh and you ruffled his hair.
[15236.30 - 15238.30] P:1270.03 E:0.063853 |  What were you saying to him then?
[15238.30 - 15242.30] P:1281.10 E:0.035964 |  These are the days that it's all about, you know?
[15242.30 - 15247.30] P:1405.44 E:0.044110 |  We know if we pick that system
[15247.30 - 15252.30] P:1357.09 E:0.041840 |  and pick the players we picked, if we don't win the game, we're dead.
[15252.30 - 15259.30] P:1382.25 E:0.047126 |  So you've got to have the courage of your convictions, I suppose,
[15259.30 - 15261.30] P:1307.12 E:0.058446 |  that that was the best way to go.
[15261.30 - 15267.30] P:1192.77 E:0.048384 |  I think the players really took that on board and went with it.
[15267.30 - 15271.30] P:1425.93 E:0.058886 |  And we know we've got a squad and we know that games right through this tournament
[15271.30 - 15272.30] P:1463.75 E:0.060239 |  are going to be decided.
[15272.30 - 15276.30] P:1411.54 E:0.054065 |  You know, last night both matches had six subs on the pitch,
[15276.30 - 15279.30] P:1538.69 E:0.054852 |  so over half the team being changed during the game.
[15279.30 - 15282.30] P:1541.97 E:0.057349 |  To have that depth, to be able to make the changes is important.
[15282.30 - 15286.30] P:1519.96 E:0.057720 |  And we've got to try to use those players at the right moments
[15286.30 - 15288.30] P:1324.45 E:0.061802 |  where they can have the biggest impact.
[15288.30 - 15290.30] P:1233.50 E:0.062156 |  You've got a lot going on now, haven't you?
[15290.30 - 15292.30] P:1373.90 E:0.031796 |  You've got to go to Rome.
[15292.30 - 15295.30] P:1627.21 E:0.036115 |  There's the euphoria after this, which I guess is something
[15295.30 - 15301.30] P:1574.45 E:0.046703 |  that you're going to have to get everyone back together over.
[15301.30 - 15305.30] P:1625.58 E:0.051471 |  But also at the same time, you know, so many of this squad were involved
[15305.30 - 15308.30] P:1444.55 E:0.057113 |  in the semifinal getting so far, but no further last time.
[15308.30 - 15311.30] P:1832.38 E:0.045444 |  So, sum it all up for us.
[15311.30 - 15315.30] P:1691.28 E:0.035968 |  Yeah, somebody just said to me that it's the first time for 50 years
[15315.30 - 15318.30] P:1451.49 E:0.063312 |  that we've backed up a semifinal with a quarter-final.
[15318.30 - 15322.30] P:1515.61 E:0.055073 |  And, you know, these players have got to keep writing those stories.
[15322.30 - 15323.30] P:1510.26 E:0.059664 |  That's the thing.
[15323.30 - 15325.30] P:1427.19 E:0.054655 |  And they're having a scene in the changing room,
[15325.30 - 15329.30] P:1458.53 E:0.059166 |  and I had to be the party pooper as usual to say, look, it's great.
[15329.30 - 15331.30] P:1280.80 E:0.052182 |  And they knew it themselves,
[15331.30 - 15334.30] P:1375.93 E:0.057628 |  but it doesn't mean a thing if we lose on Saturday.
[15334.30 - 15338.30] P:1374.99 E:0.050817 |  And, of course, it's brilliant for everybody to be excited.
[15338.30 - 15343.30] P:1364.57 E:0.057924 |  But, yeah, we're mugs if we think we're in the right half of the draw
[15343.30 - 15345.30] P:1283.34 E:0.068068 |  and we're carried away by all of that.
[15345.30 - 15347.30] P:1305.02 E:0.055203 |  We've got to get Saturday's game right.
[15347.30 - 15349.30] P:1294.16 E:0.062879 |  Whoever we play is going to be really difficult.
[15349.30 - 15352.30] P:1500.98 E:0.056165 |  We don't have our fans with us, which we've had.
[15352.30 - 15356.30] P:1412.20 E:0.060385 |  And today would have taken a lot physically and emotionally
[15356.30 - 15360.30] P:1405.21 E:0.058295 |  out of the players, so, yeah, we've got to start preparing for that now.
[15360.30 - 15363.30] P:1430.49 E:0.042408 |  And the final quick one, 25 years on.
[15363.30 - 15365.30] P:1406.65 E:0.049776 |  Very different feeling.
[15365.30 - 15367.30] P:1596.52 E:0.056505 |  Sorry, John, I've distracted that.
[15367.30 - 15369.30] P:1488.69 E:0.062820 |  25 years on.
[15369.30 - 15371.30] P:1366.65 E:0.065943 |  You didn't want to talk about that, though, that last night.
[15371.30 - 15373.30] P:1434.78 E:0.043671 |  Very different feeling.
[15373.30 - 15378.30] P:1458.95 E:0.050999 |  Yeah, it is, but it's because of the feeling you give to everybody else.
[15378.30 - 15381.30] P:1315.11 E:0.039712 |  And, yeah, I can't change it.
[15381.30 - 15385.30] P:1508.41 E:0.053472 |  I saw a big picture of Dave Seaman on the scoreboard,
[15385.30 - 15390.30] P:1482.43 E:0.048379 |  and, you know, I can't change the fact that he didn't get the chance to play in a final.
[15390.30 - 15394.30] P:1332.26 E:0.058036 |  So, unfortunately, that will always live with me, but so will today.
[15394.30 - 15398.30] P:1353.80 E:0.050764 |  And, yeah, nice that we've been able to give people something to smile about.
[15398.30 - 15400.30] P:1313.05 E:0.055682 |  Lovely. Well done today, Gareth.
[15400.30 - 15402.30] P:1452.31 E:0.055122 |  Good luck in the quarter-final.
[15402.30 - 15404.30] P:1398.29 E:0.031817 |  Thank you. Thank you. Gareth Southgate.
[15404.30 - 15407.30] P:1650.67 E:0.041731 |  He still carries it, Chris, doesn't he?
[15407.30 - 15409.30] P:1808.22 E:0.036540 |  And you'll understand.
[15409.30 - 15411.30] P:1864.22 E:0.038559 |  What's he carrying?
[15411.30 - 15414.30] P:1847.02 E:0.038323 |  Well, what would it be?
[15414.30 - 15416.30] P:1896.58 E:0.068534 |  You know.
[15416.30 - 15419.30] P:1671.62 E:0.064843 |  No, it's all right. Oh, no, I just dropped my fishing rod there.
[15419.30 - 15422.30] P:1878.30 E:0.069569 |  No, no, listen, he's got it.
[15422.30 - 15425.30] P:1740.62 E:0.060073 |  He'll always remember it.
[15425.30 - 15429.30] P:1874.11 E:0.059617 |  It's a moment in football career which he could change, but you can't.
[15429.30 - 15432.30] P:1883.74 E:0.058511 |  He just got on with it. Listen, he's gone on and done great things.
[15432.30 - 15435.30] P:1614.33 E:0.064645 |  He's managing England now, and he's gone on as a player.
[15435.30 - 15437.30] P:1885.48 E:0.056738 |  He did really well. He carried it on. It didn't affect them.
[15437.30 - 15440.30] P:2082.97 E:0.056255 |  People will always remain them, and obviously this fixture always comes up,
[15440.30 - 15442.30] P:1766.08 E:0.048757 |  and it'll be remaining again.
[15442.30 - 15444.30] P:1970.10 E:0.051949 |  So, you know, you just got to get on with it.
[15444.30 - 15447.30] P:1618.01 E:0.057835 |  I think he handles it all right, but it'll still always be there.
[15447.30 - 15450.30] P:1913.12 E:0.061727 |  And I'm sure every week somebody will ask him about it.
[15450.30 - 15455.30] P:1919.11 E:0.043776 |  Good thing or a bad thing, Karen, that they have to go to Rome for the quarter-finals?
[15455.30 - 15461.30] P:1922.40 E:0.037451 |  Well, it is what it is, but obviously I think the team, the staff,
[15461.30 - 15464.30] P:1838.34 E:0.050316 |  would all prefer them not to travel.
[15464.30 - 15468.30] P:1810.81 E:0.043007 |  Just travelling as a player in tournament, more so for the staff.
[15468.30 - 15470.30] P:1920.03 E:0.053426 |  It is a logistical...
[15470.30 - 15474.30] P:1750.64 E:0.061225 |  It is a little bit harder, and they've made St George's Park a home for them,
[15474.30 - 15477.30] P:1765.49 E:0.062453 |  so they won't have that feeling. You won't have the home comforts,
[15477.30 - 15482.30] P:1786.10 E:0.057912 |  but hopefully it is only a short stay, and then they're back to London playing here again
[15482.30 - 15485.30] P:1893.38 E:0.052871 |  and back to St George's Park, but it is what it is.
[15485.30 - 15489.30] P:1869.03 E:0.055244 |  I do think it has helped the side stay in here in the UK,
[15489.30 - 15492.30] P:1616.09 E:0.055143 |  but as I said, it is what it is, and they're going to have to recover,
[15492.30 - 15495.30] P:1406.49 E:0.059906 |  and they have to recover very quickly, because there were some tired legs out there,
[15495.30 - 15499.30] P:1787.20 E:0.045542 |  and as he said, there's a massive game coming up now.
[15499.30 - 15501.30] P:1911.56 E:0.059061 |  Just wonder whether, actually, by travelling,
[15501.30 - 15504.30] P:1869.67 E:0.050638 |  Mike, are you just getting out of the country for a few days?
[15504.30 - 15507.30] P:1916.82 E:0.047465 |  It takes them away from a little bit of the hype
[15507.30 - 15510.30] P:1853.83 E:0.038587 |  that we'll build here over the next two days, or so?
[15510.30 - 15513.30] P:1733.80 E:0.051873 |  No, I can see it both ways if I'm being totally honest, chapters,
[15513.30 - 15517.30] P:1629.12 E:0.046683 |  but I think staying at home in your own surroundings,
[15517.30 - 15519.30] P:1849.02 E:0.040167 |  it can only be beneficial.
[15519.30 - 15523.30] P:1938.14 E:0.044641 |  I think in terms of confidence as well, you know,
[15523.30 - 15527.30] P:1959.53 E:0.045656 |  from the Scotland game where there was so disappointing,
[15527.30 - 15530.30] P:1780.05 E:0.046941 |  and everyone was a typical same all England,
[15530.30 - 15532.30] P:2013.54 E:0.048267 |  to go and beat Germany.
[15532.30 - 15535.30] P:1814.86 E:0.048299 |  Yes, it wasn't all the performance that we wanted to see,
[15535.30 - 15538.30] P:1928.94 E:0.047233 |  the midfield's going to go on the ball a bit more,
[15538.30 - 15540.30] P:2034.90 E:0.036196 |  but it's a massive statement,
[15540.30 - 15543.30] P:1842.19 E:0.034280 |  and for confidence there's nothing better
[15543.30 - 15546.30] P:1713.88 E:0.039485 |  than having that off your back and beating Germany.
[15546.30 - 15551.30] P:1879.16 E:0.052481 |  So, Sweden, Ukraine coming in 10 minutes time here on 5 Live.
[15551.30 - 15554.30] P:1942.31 E:0.060449 |  Let's just round up what's been happening at Wimbledon today.
[15554.30 - 15556.30] P:1917.52 E:0.046637 |  Alison Mitchell is there.
[15556.30 - 15558.30] P:1821.93 E:0.044986 |  Hello, Chappers.
[15558.30 - 15560.30] P:1536.75 E:0.058993 |  We'll start with centre court,
[15560.30 - 15563.30] P:1823.31 E:0.057975 |  because Serena Williams has currently left with the trainer
[15563.30 - 15566.30] P:1583.21 E:0.059344 |  and concern over her ankle.
[15566.30 - 15568.30] P:1923.25 E:0.066429 |  Now, she'd gone a break up,
[15568.30 - 15570.30] P:1511.80 E:0.061356 |  she'd been broken back by Aleksandr Sasnovich,
[15570.30 - 15572.30] P:1920.71 E:0.053340 |  3-2 with serve,
[15572.30 - 15574.30] P:1836.76 E:0.047781 |  but a lot of concern about Serena Williams,
[15574.30 - 15577.30] P:1703.47 E:0.055316 |  who has just started her bid for a record-equalling 24th
[15577.30 - 15579.30] P:1858.96 E:0.050522 |  at Grand Slam title,
[15579.30 - 15582.30] P:1770.20 E:0.065253 |  and it's the same court at which Adrian Manorino,
[15582.30 - 15585.30] P:1554.34 E:0.053764 |  Roger Federer's opponent, slipped on earlier,
[15585.30 - 15590.30] P:1821.20 E:0.054744 |  a slip which in fact led to Manorino forfeiting the match.
[15590.30 - 15592.30] P:1964.47 E:0.056400 |  Federer going through,
[15592.30 - 15594.30] P:1672.79 E:0.070230 |  now Federer had been in some trouble,
[15594.30 - 15596.30] P:1448.33 E:0.058267 |  and there was a real chance of centre court upset.
[15596.30 - 15598.30] P:1959.28 E:0.062697 |  Federer was 2-1 down,
[15598.30 - 15601.30] P:1580.94 E:0.057974 |  a point then he went to break up in the fourth.
[15601.30 - 15603.30] P:1474.83 E:0.064971 |  That was when Manorino slipped,
[15603.30 - 15605.30] P:1662.56 E:0.066914 |  really seemed to have hurt his knee.
[15605.30 - 15607.30] P:1782.32 E:0.054358 |  He tried to continue, Federer won the fourth set,
[15607.30 - 15609.30] P:1631.26 E:0.050501 |  6-2 to level things,
[15609.30 - 15611.30] P:1390.07 E:0.059016 |  and it was right at the start of the fifth set
[15611.30 - 15613.30] P:1731.41 E:0.053622 |  when Manorino just said enough to nut you,
[15613.30 - 15615.30] P:1665.49 E:0.067388 |  Federer threw to the second round,
[15615.30 - 15617.30] P:1891.99 E:0.067025 |  but following injury to Manorino,
[15617.30 - 15620.30] P:1816.45 E:0.062031 |  and now the match straight away after on centre court,
[15620.30 - 15622.30] P:1412.24 E:0.064348 |  we've seen Serena Williams go.
[15622.30 - 15624.30] P:1524.72 E:0.063348 |  Now, whether these surfaces are getting a little greasy,
[15624.30 - 15627.30] P:1617.17 E:0.049684 |  particularly with the court, the roof over centre court,
[15627.30 - 15630.30] P:1743.25 E:0.059912 |  but here is Serena Williams coming back on court.
[15630.30 - 15632.30] P:1733.34 E:0.054522 |  Her right thigh is heavily strapped,
[15632.30 - 15634.30] P:1820.63 E:0.054026 |  that was always the case from the start,
[15634.30 - 15636.30] P:1849.86 E:0.064742 |  and I must mention, Chapa's her entry,
[15636.30 - 15639.30] P:1766.13 E:0.065315 |  because she came on court wearing a strap-on white skirt,
[15639.30 - 15641.30] P:1907.41 E:0.061861 |  more akin to a bridal train,
[15641.30 - 15643.30] P:1604.45 E:0.064998 |  it wafted out behind a ballooned-out,
[15643.30 - 15645.30] P:1578.48 E:0.050637 |  quite a spectacular entrance,
[15645.30 - 15647.30] P:1798.94 E:0.045513 |  but a lot of concern over Serena Williams.
[15647.30 - 15650.30] P:1575.66 E:0.054928 |  That match is live on five live sports extra.
[15650.30 - 15652.30] P:1807.16 E:0.070076 |  I've just been watching the British number four,
[15652.30 - 15654.30] P:1726.10 E:0.063438 |  Francesca Jones, play with real spirit and determination
[15654.30 - 15656.30] P:1887.88 E:0.060301 |  against Coco Goff,
[15656.30 - 15658.30] P:1842.16 E:0.044502 |  but she has exited in straight sets,
[15658.30 - 15660.30] P:1779.04 E:0.060633 |  making her Wimbledon debut 7-5-6-4,
[15660.30 - 15662.30] P:1512.29 E:0.058288 |  that went the way of the American Rising Star.
[15662.30 - 15665.30] P:1720.00 E:0.049940 |  Earlier, Britons Dan Evans just made it 3-2 the second round,
[15665.30 - 15667.30] P:1575.36 E:0.065351 |  and the Queen's runner-up, Cameron Norrie,
[15667.30 - 15670.30] P:1815.93 E:0.050240 |  is just getting his Wimbledon underway on court,
[15670.30 - 15672.30] P:1758.32 E:0.052881 |  and she's on court too against Lukapuya France.
[15672.30 - 15674.30] P:1907.22 E:0.065639 |  Thank you very much, Ali.
[15674.30 - 15676.30] P:1920.34 E:0.072367 |  Jonas Olsen has joined us,
[15676.30 - 15678.30] P:2310.27 E:0.062832 |  because Sweden against Ukraine
[15678.30 - 15682.30] P:1847.27 E:0.069493 |  is less than 10 minutes away afternoon or evening now, Jonas.
[15682.30 - 15684.30] P:2075.66 E:0.040070 |  Good evening.
[15684.30 - 15687.30] P:1963.13 E:0.041173 |  If Sweden get through this evening, Jonas,
[15687.30 - 15689.30] P:1929.72 E:0.046985 |  will they be very scared about England,
[15689.30 - 15692.30] P:1839.33 E:0.053041 |  because everybody's getting carried away here?
[15692.30 - 15695.30] P:2016.39 E:0.052157 |  They probably will be slightly scared,
[15695.30 - 15697.30] P:1990.36 E:0.068058 |  but then again, in Scandinavia,
[15697.30 - 15699.30] P:2060.46 E:0.039950 |  English football is so huge.
[15699.30 - 15701.30] P:2037.73 E:0.044752 |  You follow Sweden if you're Swedish,
[15701.30 - 15703.30] P:2022.26 E:0.068970 |  you follow Denmark if you're Danish, of course,
[15703.30 - 15706.30] P:1941.52 E:0.055635 |  but then you have almost everyone has England as a second team,
[15706.30 - 15709.30] P:1827.39 E:0.057051 |  so it will be kind of a derby kind of game,
[15709.30 - 15712.30] P:1834.68 E:0.054311 |  but we need to get there first.
[15712.30 - 15716.30] P:1841.72 E:0.061233 |  I was going to say the serious point in all of that,
[15716.30 - 15719.30] P:1981.98 E:0.057197 |  actually, Jonas, is that Sweden are in really, really good form.
[15719.30 - 15722.30] P:1790.61 E:0.056654 |  They've won seven out of their eight matches this calendar year.
[15722.30 - 15724.30] P:1640.19 E:0.065795 |  They've drawn the other.
[15724.30 - 15728.30] P:1768.78 E:0.059206 |  I mean, Sweden are not to be underestimated by anybody,
[15728.30 - 15730.30] P:1581.88 E:0.042506 |  I would suggest.
[15730.30 - 15733.30] P:1605.69 E:0.047835 |  No, they are in, like you say, in great form.
[15733.30 - 15736.30] P:1721.36 E:0.054368 |  They have really ex-factor players like Alexander Isak,
[15736.30 - 15739.30] P:1896.68 E:0.059100 |  like Emma Forsberg, who already scored three,
[15739.30 - 15742.30] P:1930.79 E:0.055865 |  Dejan Kosevsky, who will start today up front with Isak.
[15742.30 - 15747.30] P:1777.80 E:0.054384 |  And the problem is, if you look at it in a longer perspective,
[15747.30 - 15749.30] P:1842.45 E:0.057306 |  and probably what you like to hear,
[15749.30 - 15752.30] P:1798.42 E:0.058813 |  with the slightly cynical approach Sweden do have,
[15752.30 - 15754.30] P:1671.63 E:0.055502 |  they really overachieve.
[15754.30 - 15756.30] P:1763.81 E:0.055738 |  But then again, they are consistent,
[15756.30 - 15760.30] P:1737.28 E:0.054977 |  and like today, I see them as favourites today,
[15760.30 - 15764.30] P:1724.38 E:0.054028 |  and if they play a team that, you know, on paper, you should beat,
[15764.30 - 15767.30] P:1685.87 E:0.060103 |  they will beat them, nine times out of ten.
[15767.30 - 15770.30] P:1840.34 E:0.056407 |  So that's a good thing about today,
[15770.30 - 15772.30] P:1829.88 E:0.054452 |  and in a long perspective,
[15772.30 - 15774.30] P:1781.02 E:0.048059 |  yeah, there's a slightly concern, of course,
[15774.30 - 15777.30] P:1720.98 E:0.044052 |  regarding England and how well they did today.
[15777.30 - 15780.30] P:1675.04 E:0.051391 |  Have they surprised you in this tournament, Sweden?
[15780.30 - 15782.30] P:1611.86 E:0.018151 |  Or have they completely deleted?
[15782.30 - 15784.30] P:1608.87 E:0.056105 |  Not really.
[15784.30 - 15788.30] P:1641.48 E:0.042919 |  I think, surprise, what surprised us a little bit,
[15788.30 - 15791.30] P:1934.31 E:0.059732 |  is how deep we've been sitting, again, not against Spain,
[15791.30 - 15793.30] P:1875.94 E:0.056341 |  but against Slovakia in the first half,
[15793.30 - 15797.30] P:1735.00 E:0.052663 |  against Poland, you know, the majority of the second half.
[15797.30 - 15799.30] P:1857.61 E:0.056612 |  I think this team is better on the front foot,
[15799.30 - 15803.30] P:1748.43 E:0.053402 |  and I really hope today that they start the game on the front foot.
[15803.30 - 15806.30] P:1538.35 E:0.053480 |  They're a better team, playing like that,
[15806.30 - 15809.30] P:1792.56 E:0.061569 |  they have a back line who are comfortable pushing high up,
[15809.30 - 15811.30] P:1807.49 E:0.056267 |  and they're opponents today, Ukraine,
[15811.30 - 15813.30] P:1702.21 E:0.058616 |  it's unwanted territory for them.
[15813.30 - 15816.30] P:1820.35 E:0.053688 |  It's the first time they're in the last 16,
[15816.30 - 15820.30] P:1612.27 E:0.055916 |  so I really hope Sweden starts, you know,
[15820.30 - 15822.30] P:1453.67 E:0.045707 |  and hits the ground running from the first minute.
[15822.30 - 15825.30] P:1728.74 E:0.068345 |  Jonas, for the moment, thank you very much.
[15825.30 - 15830.30] P:1749.87 E:0.065980 |  Micah, and Karen, and Chris, thank you as well.
[15830.30 - 15832.30] P:1654.09 E:0.076727 |  We are done here at Wembley.
[15832.30 - 15836.30] P:1820.91 E:0.065431 |  We know seven of the eight teams in the quarter-finals.
[15836.30 - 15838.30] P:1839.62 E:0.069917 |  Italy are going to be playing Belgium,
[15838.30 - 15840.30] P:1712.52 E:0.070699 |  Denmark will be playing the Czech Republic,
[15840.30 - 15842.30] P:1848.49 E:0.067173 |  Spain are taking on Switzerland,
[15842.30 - 15845.30] P:1801.34 E:0.074432 |  and after what we've seen here at Wembley,
[15845.30 - 15847.30] P:1754.28 E:0.069017 |  England will be taking on the winners
[15847.30 - 15850.30] P:1757.44 E:0.068576 |  of either Sweden and Ukraine,
[15850.30 - 15855.30] P:1804.66 E:0.061612 |  and they are at Hamden, along with Pan-Evon and Ian Dennis.
[15855.30 - 15860.30] P:1869.68 E:0.070448 |  Thank you, Mark. Perfect timing on what is a glorious evening in Glasgow.
[15860.30 - 15864.30] P:1891.33 E:0.064644 |  It's been extremely hot these last couple of days.
[15864.30 - 15867.30] P:1840.77 E:0.069385 |  Sadly, there are no supporters who have been able to travel
[15867.30 - 15871.30] P:1879.93 E:0.069311 |  from Ukraine or Sweden because of the quarantine rules,
[15871.30 - 15874.30] P:1964.44 E:0.068016 |  and certainly Jan Andersson, the Swedish coach last night,
[15874.30 - 15876.30] P:1837.05 E:0.066463 |  was very, very critical,
[15876.30 - 15879.30] P:1880.53 E:0.065682 |  but those who, of course, do reside in this country,
[15879.30 - 15881.30] P:1849.65 E:0.070495 |  whether they're Swedish or Ukraine,
[15881.30 - 15885.30] P:1888.92 E:0.066548 |  have come to Glasgow to celebrate and cheer on their team.
[15885.30 - 15889.30] P:1880.97 E:0.062323 |  So, as you can imagine, there is plenty of yellow shirts
[15889.30 - 15893.30] P:1846.64 E:0.062758 |  on view here at Hamden in the sunshine,
[15893.30 - 15897.30] P:1823.95 E:0.054400 |  as we will now stand for the national anthems
[15897.30 - 15900.30] P:1775.43 E:0.058170 |  here on BBC Radio 5 Live,
[15900.30 - 15904.30] P:1721.94 E:0.059359 |  and, first of all, it will be the anthem of Ukraine.
[15984.30 - 15988.30] P:1744.47 E:0.081244 |  The Ukrainian players turn around and acknowledge the Ukrainian supporters.
[15988.30 - 15992.30] P:1768.40 E:0.070417 |  There is a large chunk away on the far side to the right.
[15992.30 - 15995.30] P:1710.97 E:0.068282 |  There's now the Sweden players, Lynne Carmes,
[15995.30 - 16000.30] P:1576.11 E:0.057423 |  and now it's the anthem, now ancient, now free, for Sweden.
[16043.30 - 16047.30] P:1198.01 E:0.067561 |  MUSIC
[16065.30 - 16068.30] P:1790.55 E:0.076904 |  Respectfully observed, the national anthems for Ukraine
[16068.30 - 16070.30] P:1832.23 E:0.070205 |  and then Sweden.
[16070.30 - 16076.30] P:1900.38 E:0.068087 |  That's the last 16th line-up as far as the Euros are concerned.
[16076.30 - 16079.30] P:1926.21 E:0.062875 |  It is Ukraine against Sweden.
[16079.30 - 16084.30] P:1843.11 E:0.069197 |  It's coming up on BBC Radio 5 Live after some breaking news from Wimbledon.
[16084.30 - 16086.30] P:1812.82 E:0.064964 |  Alison Mitchell.
[16086.30 - 16091.30] P:1794.93 E:0.069457 |  Serena Williams has had to retire from her first round match.
[16091.30 - 16093.30] P:1571.74 E:0.064070 |  Centre court is quite stunned.
[16093.30 - 16096.30] P:1966.93 E:0.069024 |  Serena Williams emotional. She has left the court.
[16096.30 - 16099.30] P:1873.32 E:0.061154 |  We heard that she had left the court with some injury problems.
[16099.30 - 16102.30] P:1795.90 E:0.068441 |  She came back out, she tried to continue as three games all.
[16102.30 - 16106.30] P:1659.44 E:0.072586 |  She was attempting to serve, but in increasing pain on her left leg,
[16106.30 - 16108.30] P:1731.64 E:0.070430 |  pain etched on her face.
[16108.30 - 16110.30] P:1715.81 E:0.065073 |  The crowd rose to try and rally her.
[16110.30 - 16113.30] P:1827.37 E:0.063195 |  That almost brought tears from Serena, and eventually,
[16113.30 - 16116.30] P:1854.07 E:0.067172 |  eventually the pain too much, and she has left Wimbledon.
[16116.30 - 16118.30] P:1676.31 E:0.067685 |  There will be no 8th Wimbledon title,
[16118.30 - 16123.30] P:1719.26 E:0.066087 |  no 24th Grand Slam title here at this Grand Slam in 2021.
[16123.30 - 16127.30] P:1805.27 E:0.065072 |  Will she be back here? She will turn 40 in September,
[16127.30 - 16130.30] P:1988.04 E:0.066846 |  but it is a huge, huge story here at Wimbledon
[16130.30 - 16135.30] P:1726.85 E:0.048542 |  that Serena Williams has had to retire from her first round match.
[16135.30 - 16138.30] P:1875.75 E:0.072334 |  Thank you, Alison, for reminding that the Wimbledon coverage continues
[16138.30 - 16141.30] P:1936.47 E:0.070902 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra,
[16141.30 - 16144.30] P:1928.76 E:0.063317 |  but this is 5 Live Sport here at Hamden.
[16144.30 - 16149.30] P:1921.39 E:0.068252 |  Clear blue skies, and we are ready for this game where England await the winners.
