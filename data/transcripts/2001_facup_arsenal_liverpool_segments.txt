[0.00 - 6.80] P:1767.91 E:0.031016 |  Vengas Arsenal look like this, Seaman in goal, a back four of Dixon, Keown, Adams and Cole.
[6.80 - 14.24] P:1900.59 E:0.046202 |  In midfield we have Ljungberg, Grimondi, Vieira and Perez, an upfront two more French World Cup stars
[14.24 - 21.04] P:1904.70 E:0.048367 |  Sylvain Wiltor and Thierry Henri. The substitutes for Arsenal today are Manninga,
[21.04 - 27.04] P:1874.94 E:0.047684 |  Parler, Burgkamp, Kanu and Lorraine. What a substitutes bench. Gerard Julier's Liverpool
[27.04 - 33.76] P:1832.79 E:0.043705 |  line up like this, Vesterbilt in goal, across the back, Barbel, Hoopier, Henshaw and Carriga.
[33.76 - 40.56] P:1855.17 E:0.043212 |  In midfield we have Gerard Murphy, Haman and Smitsa. At upfront Michael Owen is paired with
[40.56 - 46.00] P:1894.58 E:0.047717 |  Emil Heskey which means that another England striker Robbie Fowler is on the bench and with
[46.00 - 53.60] P:1751.31 E:0.037626 |  Robbie Fowler on the bench we have Arfexhad, Berger, McAllister and Vignole. Okay let's go
[53.60 - 59.12] P:1799.05 E:0.048541 |  straight off and join our commentary team there, Jimmy Armfield, Mike Ingham and first of all
[59.12 - 71.52] P:1669.00 E:0.051747 |  Alan Green. The referee is Steve Dunn and let me run down the two liners. First of all Arsenal
[71.52 - 76.32] P:1530.21 E:0.051936 |  will be playing in the normal strip of red shirts with white sleeves, white shorts and white socks.
[77.20 - 84.72] P:1375.97 E:0.052161 |  Seaman is the goalkeeper, the defenders are Dixon, Keown, Adams and Cole. In midfield Lombard,
[84.72 - 92.16] P:1399.59 E:0.044984 |  Vieira, Grimondi and Perez and the strikers Wilthood and Henri. Liverpool in their goal
[92.16 - 98.96] P:1451.68 E:0.049846 |  shirts with Navy flashes, Navy shorts, going to Huddle, a customary Huddle even though Robbie Fowler
[98.96 - 103.68] P:1469.40 E:0.043746 |  isn't in the starting line up. Their line up Vesterbilt's the goalkeeper, the defenders are
[103.68 - 110.72] P:1421.07 E:0.041459 |  Babel, Onscho, Uppia and Carragher. A midfield of Murphy down the right it seems at the start,
[110.72 - 117.68] P:1510.85 E:0.039831 |  Gerard, Hermann and Schmitzer, then Heskey and oh and Steve Dunn is the referee, he's taken the
[117.68 - 125.44] P:1422.06 E:0.042943 |  signals from both linesmen and the 2001 FA Cup final sponsored by AXA is underway at a stadium
[125.44 - 131.76] P:1341.00 E:0.038892 |  that is truly a magnificent venue. At which point we welcome listeners to the BBC's World
[131.76 - 137.76] P:1235.06 E:0.046726 |  Service, wherever you are, I hope it's as nice a day as it is here in the Welsh capital. Glory is
[137.76 - 145.04] P:1303.40 E:0.048773 |  sunshine, sweltering temperatures, it's normal FA Cup final weather. Liverpool attacking the goal
[145.04 - 151.60] P:1397.14 E:0.040591 |  to our right and defending the tough end in the first half, Havapole, Uppia, the captain to Gerard,
[151.60 - 156.80] P:1339.92 E:0.045815 |  on to Babel and Babel is beaten by Perez and Henri takes it up, Wilthood ahead of him but it's a
[156.80 - 161.28] P:1395.05 E:0.046598 |  good ball to Perez, left back to the penalty area, he's into the Liverpool penalty area though it's
[161.28 - 166.56] P:1348.98 E:0.051150 |  a good tackle by Babel and it's behind for a corner to Arsenal, Jimmy. Yes well first corner to
[166.56 - 170.56] P:1408.53 E:0.059240 |  Arsenal, it was an error by Babel, he gave the ball away on the half-were line and they broke very
[170.56 - 175.04] P:1638.94 E:0.055632 |  quickly and in the end he had to do well the German there to rescue it, corner kick to Arsenal,
[176.08 - 181.92] P:1310.43 E:0.046383 |  from there left and Perez to take it, Perez he scored the winning goal in the semi-final
[182.00 - 186.16] P:1372.17 E:0.043049 |  against Tottenham Hotspur, right footed, turning in and a good catch by Vesterbilt,
[186.72 - 192.08] P:1341.55 E:0.045834 |  who awkwardly for him in this first half is looking into the sunshine, there's only about a
[192.08 - 196.48] P:1314.44 E:0.050090 |  quarter of the grind, he's basking in sunshine at the moment but certainly Vesterbilt's goals
[196.48 - 202.32] P:1353.60 E:0.046090 |  involved, Murphy looking for O on the far side and Michael O on six goals in his last three games,
[202.32 - 207.44] P:1338.79 E:0.048514 |  collects it, left edge of the Arsenal penalty, into it, good run by O and pulls it back and it's
[207.44 - 212.00] P:1371.14 E:0.054855 |  knocked away by Adams, how to play in the far side, throw in to Liverpool, well real threat
[212.00 - 216.80] P:1199.32 E:0.051250 |  already, a lovely ball from Murphy, I thought from the half-were line, good vision, Murphy nicked on
[216.80 - 221.44] P:1097.72 E:0.055709 |  the outside of Dixon as well which just me a little bit worrying for Arsenal's defense, Adams to the
[221.44 - 228.08] P:1285.92 E:0.056063 |  rescue, very bright start, Carragher with the throw in, few yards from the corner fly, into the
[228.08 - 233.76] P:1380.65 E:0.040995 |  penalty here it goes, Heskey jumps, heads it back, Murphy jumps two, drops kindly for Arsenal and Dixon
[233.84 - 240.40] P:1388.48 E:0.046692 |  37 years of age, slashes it upfield to safety and then there's a foul by Onery on Hubea and it's a
[240.40 - 244.32] P:1212.64 E:0.049253 |  free kick to Liverpool inside the centre circle, by the way I mentioned listeners to the BBC World
[244.32 - 250.16] P:1272.65 E:0.053717 |  Service in particular today, we think of those in Ghana, you may not know but before kickoff there
[250.16 - 256.00] P:1249.25 E:0.057429 |  was a minute silence in memory of all of those who died recently in terrible football tragedies
[256.00 - 261.84] P:1347.81 E:0.052927 |  around the world but in particular the one that happened in a crowd, here's Owen for Liverpool,
[262.56 - 268.40] P:1361.85 E:0.045916 |  tackled by Perez, ball breaks well though to Gerard, Gerard to Babel, down the Liverpool right,
[268.40 - 275.20] P:1288.68 E:0.043641 |  into Hamar, back to Stephan Altshaw once more, Altshaw, only Hubea at festival, inside the
[275.20 - 281.12] P:1288.11 E:0.049544 |  Liverpool half, everybody else in Arsenal, terrific, it's cleared by Q'n and collected by Lumber,
[281.12 - 285.68] P:1369.89 E:0.047854 |  over the half-were line, Freddie Lumber and then to the left and Xieori Onery and Onery's going
[285.68 - 291.12] P:1310.97 E:0.047481 |  to take on Altshaw and Pete's Onery goes across, Onery crosses, Carragher stabs it away right
[291.12 - 295.20] P:1388.78 E:0.052629 |  footed, good clearance by the England defender and it's out of play for a throw into Arsenal, what a
[295.20 - 299.20] P:1255.87 E:0.051999 |  great right start, terrific, I'm just going to say Altshaw, terrific start, great run down the
[299.20 - 304.08] P:1170.84 E:0.050766 |  left hand side, he likes coming down this left hand side Onery, got the ball into the box really,
[304.08 - 308.56] P:1169.11 E:0.054776 |  it was a good clearance in the end, I thought he showed a lot of pace there Onery down this left
[308.56 - 317.28] P:1271.82 E:0.054566 |  hand side, three minutes play in the 120th FA Cup final, Arsenal 0, Liverpool 0, Dixon back to David
[317.28 - 323.60] P:1244.18 E:0.056066 |  Seymour, you know this Arsenal offense Jimmy collectively is 32 years older than the Liverpool
[323.60 - 328.80] P:1218.43 E:0.055519 |  back five, it's a fair job to try and replace when I was talking to Mike about it this morning,
[328.80 - 332.72] P:1233.68 E:0.050235 |  we're trying to replace those, I mean it's a very big enough problem trying to replace Winterburn
[332.72 - 339.28] P:1349.53 E:0.044893 |  initially you know but it's there we go, they've done a fantastic job and Steve was alongside
[339.28 - 344.64] P:1365.24 E:0.051944 |  us here, we've one of them as well, throwing on the fast side to Arsenal, inside their own half,
[344.88 - 350.64] P:1245.45 E:0.052734 |  Dixon to take it, Dixon has got Grimondi inside so too is the error,
[350.64 - 356.16] P:1326.82 E:0.057066 |  tuned behind him, he's looking further down the line though towards Wilchard and Wilchard comes
[356.16 - 360.40] P:1344.82 E:0.051368 |  and it's thrown towards the Frenchman who takes it on his chest, a Liverpool thought he might have
[360.40 - 365.36] P:1321.46 E:0.045201 |  handled it, not so but Liverpool win the ball back and Hopiah tries to clear it, hits the back of
[365.36 - 372.56] P:1451.51 E:0.048070 |  Carragher and rebounds out of play on the fast side, throw in to Arsenal, St. Johnston one done the
[372.56 - 380.48] P:1450.88 E:0.050751 |  United Nils from Scotland, this is the FA Cup final though, Arsenal Nils, Liverpool Nils, Dixon on
[380.48 - 386.40] P:1421.05 E:0.055440 |  the far side, plays it in awkwardly and then there's a foul on Michael Owen and it's a free kick
[386.40 - 391.92] P:1357.47 E:0.045245 |  to Liverpool, Gerard takes it quickly but too quickly, Schmitz is offside, there was a very
[391.92 - 397.36] P:1496.49 E:0.048018 |  bright free kick, well he was and it's been a very encouraging start, both sets of players,
[397.36 - 401.44] P:1182.66 E:0.052381 |  particularly midfield players, prepared to get forward there, Schmitz has started out on the
[401.44 - 406.08] P:1237.82 E:0.051510 |  left hand side, very quick free kick by Gerard who started in the centre midfield, he just went a
[406.08 - 411.28] P:1302.24 E:0.047972 |  little bit early and did Wilchard there from Grimondies pass and that's another free kick
[412.24 - 415.60] P:1355.94 E:0.050795 |  to Liverpool, I think it's bound to settle down Jimmie, I can't imagine if we're going to have
[415.60 - 421.28] P:1329.10 E:0.057313 |  a tack after a tack, no it's bound to be a tight match, it's been a very good start, I was very
[421.28 - 425.52] P:1254.16 E:0.058996 |  impressed by Omri's run down this left hand side, he went past on-shows, he wasn't there really
[426.08 - 430.56] P:1374.01 E:0.054443 |  and he went so quickly with it that Arsenal just couldn't get a forward player up in support of him,
[430.64 - 436.16] P:1380.28 E:0.046537 |  Vestibel well out of his penalty area to take this free kick for Liverpool, right footed and drill
[436.16 - 440.40] P:1420.79 E:0.048033 |  towards the right side very accurately, straight to Marcus Babel the right fullback, midway inside
[440.40 - 445.76] P:1464.04 E:0.045282 |  the Arsenal half to Murphy, a man behind him, Murphy tried a more ambitious pass, didn't come off but
[445.76 - 450.48] P:1561.39 E:0.049047 |  it rebounds, can't lead to Onscho, Onscho lifts it to the edge of the Arsenal penalty area and Adams
[450.48 - 455.60] P:1573.12 E:0.052154 |  heads it to the left, Ashley Cole keeps it in play, oh lovely flick on by Omri from Cole's back,
[455.60 - 460.08] P:1468.39 E:0.055517 |  Wilchard over the halfway line, Omri down the left, Gerard gets in, wonderful tackle
[460.08 - 465.68] P:1493.97 E:0.056194 |  by Steven Gerard, fantastic challenge that was, short fantastic pace as much as anything and then
[465.68 - 471.04] P:1410.00 E:0.050008 |  to challenge from behind, got a clean win of the ball, Carragher to Gerard and we've seen a lot
[471.04 - 476.64] P:1418.20 E:0.052073 |  of Steven Gerard in these opening minutes and hardly anything about Patrick Vieira, here's Babel,
[476.64 - 481.28] P:1483.28 E:0.045729 |  Babel looking for Hesky and from Murphy, Adams gets in between the two Liverpool players and
[481.84 - 488.00] P:1539.64 E:0.048653 |  clears it simply to Perez, Perez now approaching the halfway line, Vieira to his right and it goes
[488.00 - 491.44] P:1522.69 E:0.052524 |  on, he first to back to Vieira and Vieira looking for the runner Perez through the middle of the
[491.44 - 495.12] P:1590.68 E:0.053835 |  Liverpool defence, overheads the pass and it's through to Best of Oaks. Yeah it's a bit adventurous
[495.12 - 498.80] P:1373.83 E:0.056940 |  that you know I don't think Liverpool are going to give a go all the way too easily for the player
[498.80 - 502.32] P:1291.50 E:0.055679 |  just running right down the centre of the field there, it's very difficult ball to get onto.
[503.04 - 509.60] P:1472.85 E:0.051855 |  Carragher for Liverpool, left of the centre circle, back to the captain, Kofiha follows on the bench,
[509.60 - 516.00] P:1469.00 E:0.053214 |  the other Liverpool substitutes by the way are McCallister, Berger, Dignal and Erfexad, meantime
[516.00 - 521.68] P:1537.89 E:0.051152 |  it's upfield for Liverpool to Hesky, Hesky breaks in between two defenders and he definitely just
[521.68 - 527.20] P:1517.35 E:0.060103 |  fell over there on 80, it wasn't a foul challenge by Grimondi and rightly it was ignored by Steve Dunn,
[527.20 - 533.28] P:1549.16 E:0.053971 |  the Arsenal substitutions, Weninger, Harler, Canu, Burkamp and Lauren, here's Owen for Liverpool
[533.28 - 539.76] P:1576.39 E:0.059687 |  and the cleverly wins the corner for Fannin and arguably those being a bright start by both teams,
[539.76 - 543.76] P:1519.69 E:0.057503 |  Liverpool have started the brighter. Yes they have and what they're doing that said they're using the
[543.76 - 548.64] P:1290.72 E:0.055934 |  longer ball which is quite surprising and then the ball to Hesky, he chased it out to the left hand side,
[548.64 - 553.04] P:1329.13 E:0.055608 |  the last one came out to the right hand side, Michael Owen using his pace again, the both
[553.04 - 558.72] P:1520.02 E:0.049679 |  facing players had him just conceded the corner. Well Murphy who was certainly a surprise selection
[558.72 - 564.24] P:1502.09 E:0.052549 |  in the Liverpool team as far as I was concerned is to take the corner from the right in the shadow
[564.88 - 569.12] P:1469.99 E:0.048430 |  both hands are locked that's the signal played in deep, Owen and Krelfer Liverpool inside the
[569.12 - 575.44] P:1558.70 E:0.056350 |  penalty and it's still running for them but now it breaks down and it's cleared up field for Arsenal,
[575.44 - 580.08] P:1521.12 E:0.054345 |  Chiayi Henri on his own but getting support on the far side from Perez and Wilter, played to Wilter
[580.08 - 585.68] P:1580.06 E:0.050657 |  and Wilter tried to fully to pass into Perez and made no decent contact at all and finally he's
[585.68 - 590.08] P:1564.28 E:0.059123 |  tackled and beaten by Carragher but if the pass had come off Perez would have been through.
[591.84 - 596.88] P:1597.84 E:0.061589 |  I didn't play in the far side throwing to Arsenal. Yes well it's good to play that really but it was
[596.88 - 600.72] P:1503.48 E:0.050486 |  a good challenge by Carragher, he tried to get the ball to Smitser, Wilter though
[600.72 - 604.48] P:1425.60 E:0.054089 |  showed a lot of commitment chased after it, he's won himself for throwing by the corner flag.
[604.48 - 610.40] P:1444.08 E:0.052981 |  In the 90 degree he did the sunshine in the far side, Dixon with a throwing to Perez,
[610.40 - 616.00] P:1554.34 E:0.046750 |  chested back to Lee Dixon and now to Grimondi, Dixon wants more, inches in from the right
[616.00 - 620.88] P:1601.79 E:0.045652 |  tackler does well, gets past Smitser, crosses low, Hamann is there and Hamann lifts it clear left
[620.88 - 624.96] P:1583.94 E:0.047201 |  footed and Owen keeps it in play but knocks it back towards his penalty area, half cleared,
[624.96 - 630.48] P:1573.75 E:0.045048 |  the error from 30 yards shoots and it hit Henry and now it's breaking for Liverpool to Murphy
[630.48 - 636.96] P:1577.30 E:0.054251 |  and Murphy lashes it upfield and Adams is there with Keown at the combat, Heskey, Adams heads it
[636.96 - 642.72] P:1584.92 E:0.043130 |  away and Keown clears it right footed over the halfway line, Carragher jumps and heads it down
[642.72 - 648.32] P:1562.09 E:0.057924 |  and it goes to Steven Gerard and back to Hopiak. It's been warm in the Sun now, half of the ground
[648.32 - 653.20] P:1388.67 E:0.055698 |  as the game progresses the shadow is moving gradually across but it must be very warm on that far
[653.20 - 658.88] P:1463.22 E:0.058655 |  side but the players have shown terrific fitness you know that's started off with Pays of Terrific.
[659.76 - 665.60] P:1475.09 E:0.055461 |  Really good, here's Hamann for Liverpool who is in his customary role just sitting in front of the
[665.60 - 672.16] P:1449.87 E:0.050294 |  back four, Hamann again to On Show and Gerard's available and he goes to Gerard and Pierre
[672.16 - 676.08] P:1555.20 E:0.048726 |  comes close to Gerard who knocks it down the right flank, he knew the bubble was making the run,
[676.08 - 682.64] P:1581.70 E:0.054870 |  so to Adams who got across and may have been caught by the German and he was, his foot was a
[682.64 - 686.56] P:1601.12 E:0.049414 |  little bit high, I don't think there was anything particularly nasty in the challenge, he was a foul.
[686.56 - 691.60] P:1359.74 E:0.053547 |  No I live, don't worry, he's alright but what he did, he came steaming across to cover as he
[691.60 - 697.52] P:1487.65 E:0.055974 |  normally does and Babel kept his right foot there and I don't think he's too much of a knock he's got.
[698.16 - 702.40] P:1441.02 E:0.059338 |  I think he was playing the ball Babel, we played nearly 10 minutes you're listening to Sport on
[702.40 - 708.16] P:1384.55 E:0.052744 |  Five and the World Service on the BBC, you should be, this is where it really matters.
[709.12 - 715.76] P:1443.96 E:0.051826 |  Gary McAllister sitting on the Liverpool bench, a difference to the Sun has a tall over his
[716.40 - 723.28] P:1671.83 E:0.046038 |  bold plate, no surprise there, he is actually called for Arsenal, stabs it in field but only to Hamann,
[723.28 - 727.52] P:1642.82 E:0.048384 |  forward to Heskey and Heskey gets away, first of all from Keown, Keown gets in a second challenge,
[727.52 - 732.08] P:1585.51 E:0.061438 |  I didn't think either of the challenges by Keown actually were fair but he gets away with it and
[732.08 - 736.64] P:1617.69 E:0.054716 |  Arsenal take the ball forward on the left side, Perez infield from Gerard, takes the ball through
[736.64 - 741.12] P:1591.72 E:0.057958 |  the legs of Hamann, good one by Robert Peres, Dixon available in the far side, play towards Dixon,
[741.12 - 745.12] P:1722.49 E:0.056577 |  Carragher across, Dixon plays it in first time and hopefully a case for Liverpool,
[745.84 - 750.80] P:1611.42 E:0.059031 |  up to the halfway line, Keown knocks it forward again and too far forward behind for a goal kick.
[751.52 - 757.20] P:1562.39 E:0.053878 |  Well that was a good bit of play really particularly by Peres, it was almost down in front of us,
[757.20 - 761.68] P:1508.15 E:0.056893 |  in the shadow of this stand here, came in from the left hand side he went past a couple of challenges,
[762.24 - 764.96] P:1483.24 E:0.058319 |  whipped the ball across to the right though just slightly over hit but
[765.60 - 768.72] P:1355.93 E:0.061886 |  so there was no finale to it, there's not been a shot on goal yet so far,
[769.44 - 774.88] P:1463.02 E:0.059955 |  we've just had one effort, 35 yards from Vieira that was blocked, nothing else though for the
[774.88 - 779.28] P:1425.62 E:0.060861 |  goalkeepers to be worried about. That's to build with a goal kick for Liverpool,
[779.28 - 784.64] P:1424.54 E:0.051956 |  Worthington Cup one is in this stadium a couple of months ago and on course for an unprecedented
[784.64 - 790.80] P:1575.26 E:0.047067 |  trouble knowing these teamers ever won three cup finals in the same season, Schmitzer back to Hamann,
[791.28 - 795.52] P:1636.50 E:0.048647 |  left to the centre circle and plays it back to Stephan Olschow, one of the two centre backs for
[795.52 - 800.88] P:1520.06 E:0.046071 |  Liverpool. Olschow to the other centre back, Hopiah and now on to Carragher the left full back,
[800.88 - 805.28] P:1471.32 E:0.051556 |  over the halfway line in the far side of the field, Lumberg comes close, it's on to Schmitzer,
[805.28 - 810.08] P:1494.95 E:0.049410 |  Schmitzer back towards Carragher but left by Carragher for Hopiah, Arsenal with everyone back
[810.08 - 814.16] P:1442.98 E:0.055596 |  inside their own half at the moment, 11 and a half minutes play, Arsenal little Liverpool little,
[814.16 - 818.40] P:1476.71 E:0.050184 |  Murphy chest the ball down to Gerard, on to Heskey, it was an awkward pass from Gerard,
[818.40 - 822.72] P:1577.21 E:0.048587 |  Heskey couldn't make much of it and Lumberg takes it away for Arsenal, tackled by Schmitzer on the
[822.72 - 829.20] P:1569.62 E:0.043287 |  far side but gets it back to Lee Dixon, well it's going to be heavily contested this match,
[830.08 - 835.36] P:1520.11 E:0.053308 |  what a very strong players out there particularly in the midfield, here's Robert Pires for Arsenal
[835.36 - 840.16] P:1618.34 E:0.052060 |  through the centre circle, on to Henri, Henri's that first time passing that will do it but nowhere
[840.16 - 845.76] P:1588.77 E:0.044767 |  near him, Vaval to Murphy and Murphy to Heskey, Heskey couldn't take that, kindly little lunch
[845.76 - 852.80] P:1586.14 E:0.043292 |  from Tony Adams, just helped put Heskey off and Arsenal have the ball again, Vieira to Henri
[852.80 - 859.60] P:1565.87 E:0.053461 |  and now Pires and Wilter, Frenchman all, Pires was he called there by her man, it was actually a bad
[859.60 - 862.96] P:1640.99 E:0.054179 |  pass from Pires so he's quite lucky to get the free kick because otherwise the ball was going out
[862.96 - 866.32] P:1589.03 E:0.051715 |  for Liverpool through it, yeah it's just slightly late there, how long have we played Alan now with
[866.32 - 870.48] P:1612.69 E:0.053087 |  this new watch across, 13 minutes, you like it, you like it, you know I've made I mean in honour of
[870.48 - 875.04] P:1536.41 E:0.051138 |  the FA Cup final I've given Michael my watch but no doubt he'll break it permanently now,
[875.76 - 881.84] P:1587.09 E:0.053958 |  but I'll think you're right Alan, there's high pedigree footballers here, Pires with a free kick
[881.84 - 887.92] P:1651.83 E:0.042670 |  for Arsenal from the left flank into Dixon, Dixon back to Martin Keehn and Keehn just clips it forward
[888.96 - 893.68] P:1643.55 E:0.051647 |  and Vaval jumps, heads it away, her man heads it down and Murphy in the ball, he completely screws
[893.68 - 897.84] P:1574.47 E:0.050124 |  his clearance, dropping midway inside, deliver Paul half and then Carragher heads it to the half
[897.84 - 901.92] P:1694.37 E:0.048320 |  way line and interestingly Jimmy both teams are adopting the same tactics, when the other team
[901.92 - 907.04] P:1594.11 E:0.052137 |  has got the ball the opposition gets everybody back, I mean there we had everybody by a seaman
[907.04 - 912.96] P:1556.86 E:0.064098 |  inside the Liverpool half, yes it's almost it's like a two three one four you know it's a man
[912.96 - 918.56] P:1475.49 E:0.065179 |  it's a man who's playing just in front of the back for Liverpool, Gaborney for Arsenal and you've got
[918.56 - 922.56] P:1527.33 E:0.059482 |  the two strikers on both sides and the three players you know working in the middle area,
[922.56 - 930.72] P:1531.13 E:0.045587 |  much respect from one to the other, Tony Adams, St. Miran Nill, Aberdeen one in Scotland,
[931.36 - 936.64] P:1565.00 E:0.051304 |  this is Wales and this is all about England, the FA Cup final, Arsenal Nill, Liverpool Nill,
[937.36 - 944.16] P:1569.57 E:0.047168 |  Viera, Viera hits it to the left of Pires, Pires has actually Cole on the obelisk, Pires keeps the
[944.16 - 950.48] P:1584.81 E:0.045134 |  ball and then plays it off Murphy, it's going to be a throw in to Arsenal, it's going to be some
[950.48 - 955.52] P:1567.72 E:0.047297 |  difficulty passed either of these defences, Cole with a throw in to Pires, back to Cole
[956.08 - 961.76] P:1547.75 E:0.047225 |  and now Viera, very quiet so far Patrick Viera in the opening 14 minutes, Grimondi
[962.40 - 966.72] P:1638.57 E:0.051598 |  to Wilchard and Wilchard with a good pass to Keown over the half way line right at the centre
[966.72 - 972.56] P:1651.20 E:0.047364 |  circle and Martin Keown drifts it infield, easier deception by Hermann and Carragher clears it to
[972.56 - 977.68] P:1700.48 E:0.051571 |  Gerard, Gerard with lots of red shirts around him almost loses the ball but Carragher helps him out,
[977.68 - 983.36] P:1754.49 E:0.045085 |  takes it forward and then hits it long rather hopefully for Heskey, Adams across and Adams
[983.44 - 987.84] P:1699.62 E:0.053028 |  heads it away to Dixon, Dixon tackled by Schmitzer, balls out of play throw in to Arsenal.
[987.84 - 992.08] P:1621.16 E:0.051925 |  Schmitzer can't get in the game just at the moment, there has been quite a lot of the play
[992.08 - 996.64] P:1618.53 E:0.055410 |  on this side of the field but he just can't get into it. The throw in's fully 30 yards short
[996.64 - 1001.36] P:1521.92 E:0.056688 |  of the half way line though, Dixon's creeping ever so near before he takes the throw in,
[1002.08 - 1006.32] P:1702.96 E:0.054801 |  towards Wilchard, skips off the head of Carragher and drops to Hoope, so far the pitch seems to be
[1006.32 - 1010.72] P:1670.00 E:0.051613 |  holding up quite well, it must have been a far long Carragher on the far side, referee spots it,
[1010.72 - 1015.68] P:1579.35 E:0.048224 |  free kick to Liverpool pushing on Jamie Carragher, Carragher takes the free kick to Hoope,
[1015.68 - 1020.16] P:1601.97 E:0.051881 |  and now to his right to Ancho and towards our commentary vision, the Liverpool right in this
[1020.16 - 1027.36] P:1576.15 E:0.047094 |  first half, Babel, into Ancho once more, a walking pace at times and the heat, Ancho's ball forward
[1027.36 - 1032.16] P:1735.37 E:0.052532 |  easily headed away by Cole, then the error almost trips on it, stabs it forward though successfully
[1032.16 - 1036.72] P:1758.65 E:0.052677 |  to Wilchard, and Wilchard sweeps it to the Arsenal right and lead Dixon, he takes it on his chest,
[1036.72 - 1042.16] P:1718.86 E:0.048230 |  down to his feet, infield to Grimondi, on re-looking just outside the penalty, Grimondi trying to find
[1042.16 - 1047.12] P:1695.44 E:0.053188 |  him but it was headed away neatly by Carragher and here's Gerard, Heskey peels away to the left
[1047.12 - 1051.44] P:1666.27 E:0.052801 |  and Gerard looks to pick him out, Jones quickly across there aware of the danger and Jones going
[1051.44 - 1056.72] P:1650.04 E:0.059366 |  to try to shepherd that ball behind for a goal kick which he's all successful. Yes, I'm sure this
[1056.72 - 1062.64] P:1593.35 E:0.058523 |  long ball that Liverpool are playing is a genuine tactic to start off with, that's about the third
[1062.64 - 1066.88] P:1614.06 E:0.057378 |  now we've had that's been struck from the centre field out wide towards the corner flag,
[1066.88 - 1070.88] P:1553.03 E:0.054867 |  trying to use the pace of Heskey and Oye. And that rumour that Heskey would be up front in his own
[1070.88 - 1076.24] P:1439.88 E:0.056042 |  was just that, a rumour, I never thought it likely. Well I mean Oye's been on fire recently you know.
[1076.24 - 1079.44] P:1633.20 E:0.053638 |  Well you wouldn't stick him in midfield after he scored six goals in three games, would you?
[1080.32 - 1084.96] P:1625.40 E:0.055505 |  Not if you're of any side mind, 16 minutes play and that's also the reason frankly why
[1086.32 - 1091.20] P:1601.98 E:0.047108 |  you know Robbie Fowler couldn't make the starting line up, hope he doesn't get a challenge in
[1091.20 - 1095.04] P:1628.76 E:0.049796 |  the ball properly and the ball breaks to Lumber, centre of the Liverpool half, Dixon available
[1095.04 - 1101.52] P:1687.64 E:0.043644 |  now doing the right for some width, on to Lumberg again, who's gone wide, carrier close by, back
[1101.52 - 1106.96] P:1728.49 E:0.045957 |  to Dixon and Dixon with a crossfield ball, 40 yards to Ashley Cole, Cole immediately controls
[1106.96 - 1111.04] P:1634.43 E:0.051369 |  the ball and runs forward but runs straight into Danny Murphy and now it's with Gerard,
[1111.04 - 1115.44] P:1643.49 E:0.052668 |  to Murphy again, Heskey's available on the halfway line and it goes to Emil Heskey,
[1115.44 - 1119.68] P:1606.44 E:0.058889 |  where's the support for Heskey, there isn't any, he's tackled and beaten by Vieira and on it goes
[1119.68 - 1124.56] P:1728.44 E:0.062595 |  to Henry, he's definitely outside, a round festival, Arsenal must score, Henry shoots wide,
[1124.56 - 1132.08] P:1631.74 E:0.065570 |  he's paving for handball not given what a waste by Terry Henry. Well it was, that's the real chance,
[1132.08 - 1135.92] P:1553.05 E:0.060313 |  there was a real chance then because it was a simple ball really, it was looking for a lot of
[1135.92 - 1139.52] P:1628.37 E:0.057382 |  possession, they lost possession around the halfway line and the ball was knocked through,
[1139.52 - 1144.08] P:1674.55 E:0.059972 |  I thought at first he was offside but it clearly wasn't but when he came in from the right hand
[1144.08 - 1148.48] P:1567.96 E:0.064219 |  side he was appealing that the ball had been handled on the line, now we haven't the best angle of it.
[1150.16 - 1154.80] P:1682.53 E:0.056994 |  Well I'll tell you the replay isn't conclusive, the hand was sort of waving around there but
[1154.80 - 1158.72] P:1634.13 E:0.053765 |  I'm not sure that it didn't hit the post, I think it hit the post on my behind for a goal kick.
[1158.72 - 1163.28] P:1701.71 E:0.059844 |  Anyway here's Owen for Liverpool, Owen approaching the Arsenal half, he's fouled there by Adam,
[1163.28 - 1169.12] P:1722.63 E:0.068333 |  referee let's play off, now Vieira fouls Owen, now you can't let that go, he's definitely
[1169.12 - 1174.16] P:1726.26 E:0.056690 |  clenched by Adam's and the referee rightly played advantage but Vieira got Owen the second time.
[1174.16 - 1179.92] P:1677.53 E:0.061978 |  Yes it was a foul and referee Steve Dunn's having a word with him, you know what he's done, he's just
[1179.92 - 1185.20] P:1802.36 E:0.065481 |  had a quiet word with him, it's just said to him right now we've all had a go, here we are.
[1185.20 - 1189.84] P:1828.19 E:0.053592 |  Free kick to Liverpool, Haman strikes it, straight at Grimondi and I'm sure Seaman was right about
[1189.84 - 1195.04] P:1741.92 E:0.046951 |  that, Haman and Seaman have a history to remember at Wembley, Murphy back to Gerard, Gerard sweeps
[1195.04 - 1199.68] P:1692.94 E:0.056973 |  the cross in, not headed away convincingly by Arsenal, Schmitzer chasing the way to the far side,
[1200.32 - 1204.16] P:1683.85 E:0.056905 |  that was a gold-bun shot by Haman by the way, here's Schmitzer coming forward towards the
[1204.16 - 1210.00] P:1712.55 E:0.057414 |  Arsenal penalty area and he's tackled by Steve Dunn, ball breaks again to Schmitzer, couldn't
[1210.00 - 1214.00] P:1679.39 E:0.057775 |  make much use of it, Haman shoots again, I think he's got a shoot on sight there,
[1214.80 - 1220.08] P:1662.34 E:0.064815 |  philosophy this afternoon against David Seaman but Arsenal come forward into the Liverpool half,
[1220.72 - 1226.72] P:1719.69 E:0.057308 |  Henri for Arsenal to Grimondi, Henri definitely should have scored, great tackle by Gerard
[1226.72 - 1230.96] P:1725.74 E:0.063686 |  and Gerard pass over the halfway line, on to his right, goes to Michael Orton,
[1230.96 - 1234.32] P:1765.69 E:0.059577 |  taking in his chest, yard outside the penalty, great run by Heskey and then
[1234.32 - 1239.20] P:1663.96 E:0.064600 |  Adams got his body between Orton and the ball and I think that was a fair challenge by Adams
[1239.20 - 1243.12] P:1663.13 E:0.065580 |  and excited playing, it's a throw in to Arsenal. Yes well Adams' experience there was very important
[1243.12 - 1248.16] P:1715.23 E:0.061852 |  to Arsenal because Gerard did ever so well, it took the ball off Grimondi on the halfway line,
[1248.64 - 1252.64] P:1654.60 E:0.057588 |  putting it up to Orton, Orton tried to get on the outside of Adams, just right across him,
[1252.64 - 1257.36] P:1526.25 E:0.065211 |  there's no foul experience, Gerard's the dominant figure in the game so far and he's opening 19
[1257.36 - 1263.76] P:1535.48 E:0.063877 |  minutes but it's Arsenal now, Liverpool now and it is very very tight as we expected it to be.
[1263.76 - 1267.44] P:1506.63 E:0.060936 |  Well they've had a great chance Arsenal to be in front of Orton right there, it'd be interesting
[1267.44 - 1271.60] P:1492.54 E:0.055020 |  to see about you know he claimed for the penalty kick, there wasn't many other people claim for it
[1271.60 - 1278.08] P:1609.52 E:0.053825 |  but I think he claimed to help his embarrassment frankly at missing the chance, here's Babel
[1278.08 - 1282.96] P:1661.09 E:0.059869 |  over the throw in for Liverpool, almost level with the edge of the Arsenal penalty here and Babel
[1282.96 - 1289.28] P:1602.90 E:0.052423 |  can certainly reach that penalty area whereas Heskey at the moment just a few yards in front
[1289.28 - 1294.72] P:1676.75 E:0.050791 |  of the penalty spot, here comes Babel up to the touch line, high for Heskey, oh and shoots,
[1294.72 - 1299.68] P:1700.62 E:0.059729 |  blocked by Keown, that was goal by, oh that's a great shot in by Gerard, high and over.
[1300.40 - 1304.40] P:1786.13 E:0.064716 |  In form blocked by Keown, ball was coming in from that right hand side and when it broke out
[1305.04 - 1309.28] P:1668.30 E:0.059251 |  there was another shot coming in at distance this time from Gerard, not quite as accurate as I've
[1309.28 - 1315.12] P:1656.94 E:0.049809 |  seen him once or twice, he's gone over the top but it's been an explosive start to this match.
[1316.48 - 1319.84] P:1702.43 E:0.063984 |  20 minutes gone exactly. I'll tell you what was very interesting about that Gerard shot,
[1319.84 - 1326.00] P:1598.17 E:0.054052 |  it went very close to the hand down the head of Martin Keown, very very close and Keown just pulled
[1326.00 - 1332.96] P:1561.11 E:0.054451 |  his hand away in time. Arsenal now Liverpool now in the 2001 FA Cup final and this is
[1333.04 - 1337.92] P:1535.66 E:0.062516 |  World Service in five live on the BBC, thanks very much indeed for listening. Martin Keown
[1338.48 - 1344.64] P:1553.70 E:0.063631 |  for Arsenal as always in his red boots to the slightly red-haired Freddie Lumberg,
[1345.20 - 1351.76] P:1642.82 E:0.056779 |  nothing natural about that, to Cole, Cole on to Omri, Omri to Wilthood, Wilthood is
[1351.76 - 1357.20] P:1717.89 E:0.046212 |  coffee behind him, Wilthood swoops it to the far side along the ground to Dixon and the Arsenal
[1357.20 - 1362.48] P:1779.38 E:0.055703 |  right into Wilthood, tackled by Gerard and the ball breaks to Schmitz, Schmitz has played
[1362.48 - 1368.56] P:1712.54 E:0.056934 |  not great, Babel helps it on, Murphy collects and Murphy does well to hold off the air, back to
[1368.56 - 1374.48] P:1761.41 E:0.054970 |  Babel and Babel to the far side towards Vladimir Schmitz, Dixon went to meet it, didn't get it
[1374.48 - 1380.64] P:1635.26 E:0.047987 |  and it's now with Gerard, still short of the half way line, back to Carragher, Carragher for Liverpool,
[1380.64 - 1384.88] P:1706.28 E:0.051974 |  back to walking pace especially in that sunshine it's understandable, now I hope you,
[1385.60 - 1392.16] P:1580.23 E:0.059279 |  21 minutes played, nil nil between Arsenal and Liverpool, my betting, my bet was always on a
[1392.16 - 1396.80] P:1642.80 E:0.059343 |  one goal victory for one of these teams, I don't see many goals here, on show over the halfway
[1396.80 - 1401.28] P:1650.89 E:0.052175 |  line right at the centre circle, Murphy's made a run forward, the pass was short, didn't reach
[1401.28 - 1406.40] P:1693.39 E:0.051671 |  Heskey but Heskey wins it off the air, the air not on form yet, here's Murphy, Murphy tries to
[1406.40 - 1410.32] P:1694.60 E:0.061543 |  play through the legs of Adams, rebound to Heskey, Heskey shoots, takes an affliction off Adams,
[1410.32 - 1415.52] P:1792.80 E:0.068214 |  corner to Liverpool, shoot onside once or twice, now we've had about three or four goals from
[1415.52 - 1418.64] P:1602.36 E:0.058011 |  distance, both teams I think that was a bit adventurous from Heskey, I don't think it was
[1418.64 - 1423.92] P:1568.03 E:0.065292 |  going anywhere but it's got an affliction, Liverpool have won three corners already,
[1424.96 - 1428.32] P:1554.74 E:0.060643 |  you don't get a goal for a corner though do you, nope that doesn't matter, now for that,
[1429.52 - 1435.84] P:1634.98 E:0.048690 |  corner to Liverpool from the right, Danny Murphy to take it and both arms go up again, that's the
[1435.84 - 1442.00] P:1677.49 E:0.044033 |  signal, that usually means it's deep for Liverpool, it's played in deep towards Heskey, too deep,
[1442.00 - 1446.72] P:1760.29 E:0.054277 |  headed away by Adams, on show waits, on show, plays it away to the far side towards Smiths,
[1446.96 - 1452.24] P:1679.98 E:0.055547 |  important header away by Dixon and the ball's back in the halfway line with Carrager and all the
[1452.24 - 1456.80] P:1778.99 E:0.049697 |  way back to Sander Vesterbilt, can forget his age, Dixon's been a terrific player and he's still
[1456.80 - 1461.68] P:1696.76 E:0.056759 |  a good player for Arsenal, he just showed up you know all his experience there, anticipated the
[1461.68 - 1466.64] P:1732.00 E:0.054515 |  ball going, Gerard heads it on to Heskey, back it goes to Murphy, Murphy shoots a weak shot from
[1466.64 - 1471.60] P:1734.05 E:0.054583 |  Murphy and Arsenal shoot clear, midway through the first half, Arsenal little Liverpool little and
[1471.60 - 1477.52] P:1758.09 E:0.058338 |  here's my kick, well it may not be Wembley but it feels like the cup final, it's a wonderful atmosphere
[1477.52 - 1482.64] P:1720.46 E:0.055151 |  and Arsenal have a free kick, Vieira's been fouled, Arsenal playing from right to left,
[1482.64 - 1487.92] P:1637.87 E:0.054629 |  Pyrrhus shapes to take it and then just knocks it sideways all of three or four yards to Vieira,
[1487.92 - 1492.88] P:1644.71 E:0.053046 |  Vieira still by his stand is struggling to take the game here by the scruff of the neck,
[1492.88 - 1498.64] P:1708.33 E:0.052269 |  Jungberg on the half-way line and so congested down there, as Alan and Jimmy have been saying,
[1498.64 - 1503.84] P:1697.13 E:0.055788 |  very few chances and Henri's missed the best ones so far, it's now Grimondi jumping over the
[1503.84 - 1509.04] P:1762.27 E:0.055689 |  challenge, threads it towards Wiltord, Neerside just on the edge of the area, faced by Stefan Onscho,
[1509.04 - 1513.44] P:1706.00 E:0.061596 |  dinks the ball into the area, a little high for Henri, overhead kick in the end five yards wide.
[1514.16 - 1518.96] P:1826.04 E:0.064724 |  It's a class act Henri and I think even for him that was a bit adventurous on the edge of the
[1518.96 - 1523.84] P:1820.79 E:0.058473 |  box trying an overhead kick, you have a lot to see another replay of that ball when he comes in from
[1523.84 - 1528.32] P:1641.31 E:0.061710 |  the left hand side, oh we're going to see one now, funny in front of us now and the ball actually
[1528.32 - 1535.84] P:1655.57 E:0.054384 |  what it did in the post, it onscho on the arm and went behind so perhaps his call was right for a penalty.
[1536.40 - 1540.88] P:1722.58 E:0.057370 |  It's a brilliant atmosphere in Cardiff over the last 24 hours, it's almost felt like building up to
[1540.88 - 1547.36] P:1706.44 E:0.056789 |  a European Cup final here and Patrick Vieira now disputing midfield with Murphy but Murphy's there
[1547.36 - 1552.64] P:1802.59 E:0.049193 |  first, Haman he's looking for some options and eventually Babel typically with his stocking
[1552.64 - 1556.16] P:1742.76 E:0.051580 |  roll down, chips the ball in with his right foot, it's going to be too high for Michael
[1556.32 - 1560.80] P:1786.72 E:0.052512 |  and Adams just waits for it to come on to him and then just drops it at Ashley Cole's feet and Cole
[1560.80 - 1566.32] P:1686.82 E:0.051996 |  moving across the pitch almost lost that to Heskey in the end, digs it away from him and now
[1566.32 - 1570.80] P:1769.47 E:0.056068 |  Henri sets off and here comes Henri with his pace, gets away from Haman, Lungberg's made the run through
[1570.80 - 1576.16] P:1743.42 E:0.064558 |  the area, the pass from Henri was just in front of Lungberg but nevertheless Arsenal win a corner.
[1576.80 - 1581.36] P:1726.53 E:0.063796 |  Great play again by Henri, he's the problem, he's the problem at the moment, it's his pace
[1582.08 - 1587.12] P:1763.31 E:0.062150 |  and his control of the ball as well, it's a lovely run off the ball by Lungberg but fortunately for
[1587.12 - 1592.08] P:1695.79 E:0.059168 |  Liverpool, Antjo was there just kicking away, 24 and a half minutes gone in the Cup final,
[1592.08 - 1597.76] P:1569.40 E:0.059073 |  0-0 and for the first time we see Keown and Adams inside the Liverpool penalty area,
[1597.76 - 1602.16] P:1763.22 E:0.056038 |  Vieira is always dangerous, some set pieces as well in it goes, Vestival struggling a bit to get
[1602.16 - 1606.96] P:1642.25 E:0.055706 |  that one away and the referee has the whistle gone now, the play continues over on the far side,
[1606.96 - 1611.12] P:1787.54 E:0.052052 |  Heskey's looking a little bit groggy, Arsenal retrieve the ball and they work it back inside
[1611.12 - 1615.68] P:1803.38 E:0.054613 |  the penalty area but Grimondi can't get hold of that in the air against Babel and eventually
[1615.68 - 1621.68] P:1662.86 E:0.055844 |  breaks wide of Vestival for Liverpool goal kick. Yes, pretty's not the corner in there and Vestival
[1621.68 - 1625.04] P:1635.76 E:0.065120 |  was in there with Heskey and he fell rather awkwardly on his own, could it be all right,
[1625.04 - 1631.60] P:1581.89 E:0.061230 |  he seems to hobbling away towards the halfway line now. Sander Vestival has played over 50 games
[1631.60 - 1637.52] P:1614.73 E:0.046575 |  this season for Liverpool, just settles himself away to our left, just a little bit of sunshine
[1637.52 - 1643.44] P:1590.84 E:0.051312 |  still in that penalty area, this side of the stadium completely shaded as Vestival strikes
[1643.44 - 1648.96] P:1544.69 E:0.057866 |  the goal kick right footed into the Arsenal half, it's going to be Keown against Emil Heskey,
[1648.96 - 1653.84] P:1560.85 E:0.056496 |  away by Vieira and now Lungberg who's drifted in field from that far side needs a little bit of
[1653.84 - 1659.52] P:1673.92 E:0.050380 |  help, Dixon as ever will be there, 598th competitive appearance today by Lee Dixon,
[1659.52 - 1664.48] P:1754.97 E:0.055924 |  his ball across field was very ambitious, it was cut out by Danny Mills, surprise selection today,
[1664.48 - 1669.44] P:1720.04 E:0.053004 |  he uses Babel and gets it back again, Murphy near side the Liverpool right, poor control from
[1669.44 - 1674.48] P:1776.00 E:0.064172 |  Haman and Liverpool have been caught out as Arsenal break now with Henri, goes away from
[1674.48 - 1678.88] P:1805.90 E:0.060500 |  Ancho, Wiltaud's in the area, Henri's ball in though it's behind Wiltaud and there are three
[1678.88 - 1683.60] P:1709.56 E:0.056006 |  Liverpool players there, Gerard will take it away from the danger zone and clear up towards the
[1683.60 - 1688.56] P:1748.15 E:0.048642 |  half-way line but he won't reach Heskey headed back by Dixon, Liverpool still looking to try and
[1688.56 - 1693.20] P:1757.75 E:0.060238 |  cross the half-way line, Hopi is tackled by Lungberg and Arsenal now with Grimondi looking to try
[1693.20 - 1697.52] P:1772.25 E:0.060470 |  and feed Henri once more, wasn't a great ball open to the Frenchman, Babel's there and a bit of
[1697.52 - 1701.36] P:1734.58 E:0.060666 |  space now for Danny Murphy down below on the Liverpool right, immediately faced by Vieira,
[1702.00 - 1707.44] P:1808.53 E:0.052253 |  Murphy back to Haman, Arsenal nil Liverpool nil in the cup final and we've played 26 and a half
[1707.44 - 1712.40] P:1812.52 E:0.054563 |  minutes in Cardiff, now Carragher down the Liverpool left hand side over on the far side in the
[1712.40 - 1718.48] P:1737.40 E:0.049259 |  sunshine, Haman who played in that cup final two years ago for Newcastle against Manchester United,
[1718.48 - 1721.68] P:1560.96 E:0.054135 |  and would rather forget about it really, wasn't the happiest of days for him,
[1721.68 - 1727.04] P:1595.81 E:0.054422 |  Haman once more all on his own inside the centre circle, takes the ball inside the Arsenal half,
[1727.04 - 1730.56] P:1729.46 E:0.059939 |  lays it off to Steven Gerard and so many Arsenal players back behind the ball,
[1730.56 - 1734.48] P:1761.90 E:0.056946 |  long one again in from Gerard, over hit though, can't find Heskey, Siemens though.
[1734.48 - 1738.40] P:1724.71 E:0.058672 |  It wasn't about a ball though that, it was a lovely ball, chip forward, you'd right weight on it as
[1738.40 - 1743.92] P:1734.89 E:0.053163 |  well really, Heskey was a difficult ball though for a striker, you know when your ball's coming
[1743.92 - 1747.28] P:1651.82 E:0.060716 |  over your head and you're running down the centre of the field, central defenders there, it's much
[1747.28 - 1751.04] P:1732.13 E:0.059365 |  easier for the central defenders who see the ball coming all the way. Maybe the cup final,
[1751.04 - 1755.20] P:1650.19 E:0.055197 |  maybe that can be the Millennium Stadium, but Phil Thompson's still going to prowl around over on
[1755.20 - 1759.68] P:1720.81 E:0.053133 |  that far side in the technical area, barking a few instructions, whether they can be heard in an
[1759.68 - 1764.72] P:1719.32 E:0.054227 |  atmosphere like this, now Martin Keown with a long ball for Arsenal, Liverpool will leave that,
[1764.72 - 1768.88] P:1720.15 E:0.055802 |  hoping that Vestervolt's there, very awkward bounce though and Omri was in there challenging
[1768.88 - 1773.12] P:1709.59 E:0.054480 |  Vestervolt in the end a good recovery though by the Dutch goalkeeper and then a very neat under
[1773.12 - 1778.08] P:1742.03 E:0.057897 |  arm throw to feed Hamann who presumably called for it. Omnagidani Murphy, centre circle, another
[1778.08 - 1783.04] P:1814.66 E:0.056733 |  long one from Murphy and Keown is just caught out as Heskey takes it inside the area, Smits has
[1783.04 - 1787.92] P:1833.38 E:0.060311 |  gone forward, Heskey on his right foot, good block though by Keown and more, Heskey could have been
[1787.92 - 1792.00] P:1759.49 E:0.056275 |  a bit sharper there because there were players looking to be serviced from him after that initial
[1792.00 - 1796.80] P:1702.54 E:0.056631 |  error from Keown and now the error, the error seemed to be played into difficulty but he gets away
[1796.80 - 1802.72] P:1783.49 E:0.052603 |  with great strength from Murphy, it's now Robert Pires near side onto Thierry Henri, he's only got
[1802.72 - 1808.48] P:1781.74 E:0.054926 |  one goal in the FA Cup this season of penalty, Omri 25 yards out, Wiltorre's waiting, Omri steps
[1808.48 - 1812.64] P:1798.36 E:0.058412 |  over the ball and finds Pires on the left hand side, so many goal shirts from Liverpool though
[1812.64 - 1818.00] P:1835.73 E:0.052689 |  inside the penalty area, so tight in the Cup final, Nil Nil, Vieira now, strong right-footed
[1818.00 - 1823.44] P:1837.77 E:0.061095 |  ball too strong for Ljungberg and it's a goal kick against Liverpool. Well it was a great attack
[1824.08 - 1827.92] P:1722.18 E:0.060929 |  but it was tentative, there was no support play there for Omnri, the only player who really made
[1827.92 - 1831.92] P:1654.52 E:0.058572 |  the effort to make a forward run there was Wiltorre down the right hand side,
[1832.00 - 1836.40] P:1680.01 E:0.060515 |  Ljungberg was coming up on the right but he had to actually run across the box, Omri turn round
[1836.40 - 1840.48] P:1721.90 E:0.057524 |  and come back, Liverpool had seven players behind the ball, it's very difficult at the moment for
[1840.48 - 1844.32] P:1752.29 E:0.058546 |  the forward players. Just got a picture of Arsene Wenger, feeding the heat a little, he's taken
[1844.32 - 1850.40] P:1667.80 E:0.052301 |  his jacket off, he's got a mauve purple shirt over there, just wondering and obviously reflecting
[1850.40 - 1856.16] P:1679.48 E:0.054697 |  on the miss by Omnri, now good tackling, terrific tackle by Adams, Liverpool players gone down,
[1856.16 - 1861.44] P:1753.08 E:0.053424 |  I think it might be Danny Murphy, it's now Robert Pires of Arsenal trying to get that through to
[1861.44 - 1866.80] P:1761.76 E:0.055200 |  Wiltorre, well closed down by Omnri, they'll need to stop the game, there is an injury problem
[1866.80 - 1872.32] P:1600.37 E:0.049233 |  with Danny Murphy and the referee now has seen it and he's just going to see whether
[1872.32 - 1876.00] P:1628.15 E:0.054169 |  Murphy needs attention, he doesn't. Well they're offside down here, down there, it's going to be a
[1876.00 - 1881.68] P:1670.40 E:0.054137 |  free kick down at this bottom end, it's a good block by Omnri but Murphy got a knock on his ankle
[1881.68 - 1887.52] P:1617.45 E:0.057283 |  and it's a challenge by Adams. This is the Cup final and you're listening to Five Live or BBC
[1887.60 - 1891.12] P:1659.95 E:0.059701 |  World Service from Cardiff, it's nil nil between Liverpool and Arsenal, we've almost played a
[1891.12 - 1895.68] P:1691.35 E:0.054238 |  third of the Cup final and it's just as tight as we thought it would be. A Gerard, tackle by the
[1895.68 - 1900.72] P:1731.47 E:0.058652 |  error and Omnri's got the ball, back comes typically Gerard, can't get the ball away from Omnri though,
[1900.72 - 1904.56] P:1792.26 E:0.055759 |  Omnri with his great close control down the left hand side but they're short again in the penalty
[1904.56 - 1909.36] P:1724.87 E:0.054385 |  area, there's any Wiltorre there, they now try to find Dixon over on the far side, this is a problem
[1909.36 - 1914.08] P:1832.01 E:0.059377 |  sometimes for Arsenal, ball poorly cleared by Liverpool, Grimondi shot is still at Vestival
[1914.40 - 1917.84] P:1818.32 E:0.059622 |  and at times Arsenal struggling to get the numbers in the penalty area,
[1917.84 - 1921.84] P:1721.70 E:0.059590 |  some in Liverpool players back and now Babel on the half way line, another long ball,
[1921.84 - 1926.88] P:1797.93 E:0.057846 |  Heskey's given offside. Yes there was no real support for Omnri again when he came down this
[1926.88 - 1931.60] P:1670.01 E:0.054998 |  left hand side with the ball, Lungberg trying to make a late run, Carragher got it away and
[1931.60 - 1940.56] P:1649.04 E:0.052988 |  Grimondi tried a shot, 35 yards, easy picking for Vestival. Batrugera slowly conserving the
[1940.56 - 1945.84] P:1760.38 E:0.059869 |  energy, Lungberg foul by Steven Gerard, inside the centre circle, Steve down the referee,
[1946.80 - 1951.44] P:1747.99 E:0.049041 |  gives a free kick to Arsenal just inside the Liverpool half, Arsenal playing from right to
[1951.44 - 1955.52] P:1651.60 E:0.053322 |  left, well Lungberg, well yeah referees has dropped it back another couple of yards to where the
[1955.52 - 1961.28] P:1682.30 E:0.051312 |  offense actually took place and now Vieira just smoothly finds his captain Adams, Adams switches,
[1961.28 - 1966.64] P:1620.57 E:0.052814 |  Viers to the right hand side, slow build up from Arsenal, Vieira now on to Grimondi, seemed a bit
[1966.64 - 1971.28] P:1618.68 E:0.056794 |  surprised to get that one, now Dixon over on the far side, down the line to Wiltor, he can't go
[1971.28 - 1975.84] P:1658.62 E:0.053909 |  past Jamie Carragher though, well tied it up by Liverpool and Heskey at the moment playing at left
[1975.84 - 1980.24] P:1745.17 E:0.053017 |  back and cleared by Hopier but that's a rather reckless clearance straight back to Arsenal,
[1980.24 - 1984.80] P:1773.50 E:0.053202 |  Vieira wants more centre circle, on to Pires who's gone in field to make it even more congested,
[1984.80 - 1988.32] P:1791.14 E:0.059933 |  Pires now going down the right hand side feeds Lungberg, Wiltor's in the area,
[1988.32 - 1992.48] P:1729.63 E:0.058039 |  Cross doesn't come in though from Lungberg and it wins a throw in off Jamie Carragher but
[1992.56 - 1997.04] P:1738.86 E:0.059320 |  the last three or four minutes a bit better from Arsenal, yes it was nice little run from Pires,
[1998.24 - 2004.16] P:1732.79 E:0.057039 |  it's the French players really looking active for me, they've got a bit of spark in the players
[2004.16 - 2009.44] P:1698.83 E:0.059104 |  well, Pires, Henri Wiltor, could run off the ball there from Lungberg, Liverpool have blocked it,
[2009.44 - 2013.60] P:1767.52 E:0.053602 |  Dixon's throw down to Wiltor, six goals in the FA Cup, Cross coming in from Dixon,
[2013.60 - 2018.08] P:1671.75 E:0.060292 |  easy header away by Hopier who played in this stadium for Finland, it's now back again with
[2018.08 - 2022.72] P:1787.16 E:0.058553 |  Vieira, it's a good ball from him to Pires, Arsenal, oh as the ball was threaded through,
[2022.72 - 2027.68] P:1806.07 E:0.053722 |  Lungberg looks to the Lionsman over on the far side claiming he was tripped by Carragher but
[2027.68 - 2032.32] P:1632.90 E:0.049364 |  nothing doing from the Lionsman, nothing doing from the referee and Vesterbalt clears to Marcus
[2032.32 - 2037.92] P:1698.13 E:0.051740 |  Babel, Babel up against Pires, immediately closed down though by the Frenchman, Babel's in retreat
[2037.92 - 2042.96] P:1604.13 E:0.058050 |  and goes back once more to Vesterbalt who controls the ball on the edge of his area and will now
[2042.96 - 2047.76] P:1693.50 E:0.056122 |  clear and he'll reach the Arsenal half, Keown jumping with Heskey once more, taken well on the
[2047.76 - 2052.72] P:1838.09 E:0.063630 |  chest by Heskey and a little foul by Keown, free kick to Liverpool, almost halfway inside the
[2052.72 - 2057.20] P:1815.39 E:0.053347 |  Arsenal half down the centre of the field and Haman will step forward once more, it was that sort
[2057.20 - 2061.60] P:1785.42 E:0.052755 |  of range of course when he beats Seaman at Wembley but this time he takes it short, Gerard now,
[2061.60 - 2067.44] P:1791.28 E:0.060561 |  poor ball by Gerard, easily cut out by Cole, Cole onto Pires, Pires with Henri on the outside,
[2067.44 - 2072.40] P:1689.24 E:0.056839 |  lovely quick feet from Thierry Henri, getting away from Gerard and Babel, Henri again, oh I don't
[2072.40 - 2076.48] P:1772.45 E:0.057968 |  know what he was trying to do there, hit it straight towards Wiltor, there was no way he was going
[2076.48 - 2080.72] P:1683.67 E:0.051632 |  to get that one, once more Vesterbalt picks up the loose ball in the penalty area. It's gone a bit
[2080.72 - 2085.44] P:1701.93 E:0.053648 |  defensive, then the game has actually gone a bit defensive in the last sort of 10 minutes as
[2086.08 - 2090.72] P:1714.66 E:0.058123 |  very few players really looking to join the front players and attack the midfield players,
[2090.72 - 2094.48] P:1692.46 E:0.061520 |  just one at a time going as opposed to two or three, you know really supporting the front players,
[2095.12 - 2100.16] P:1619.22 E:0.059618 |  consequently people like Henri, Wiltor, Owen, Neske, I mean to go it alone a little bit. Best
[2100.16 - 2105.20] P:1733.02 E:0.056595 |  chance of the game so far, Henri missed it and Liverpool haven't really created a direct opportunity
[2105.36 - 2109.68] P:1755.47 E:0.053696 |  yet in the game, as Carragher now shovels the ball down the left hand side, Smits are very quiet
[2109.68 - 2114.64] P:1735.22 E:0.058149 |  so far up against Lee Dixon and he's won the corner kick, he's done very well there by the
[2114.64 - 2119.84] P:1781.02 E:0.056729 |  Miesmitser, corner kick to Liverpool, something out of nothing certainly and now a chance for
[2119.84 - 2124.96] P:1674.16 E:0.053532 |  Huppier to go forward and what usually happens here and it's very dangerous, it's like Jack
[2124.96 - 2130.24] P:1662.53 E:0.054420 |  Charlton used to do for Leeds in the 60s, Huppier normally just stands in front of the goalkeeper,
[2130.40 - 2136.00] P:1680.74 E:0.056358 |  corner kick to Liverpool over on the far side of the field, Smits are to take it,
[2136.00 - 2141.04] P:1625.25 E:0.052035 |  Huppier standing just in front of David Seaman, Michael Owen looking for a knock on,
[2141.04 - 2146.24] P:1788.12 E:0.051868 |  Babel's gone forward as well, Hamann lurking on the edge of the area and it comes, Seaman's missed
[2146.24 - 2151.28] P:1705.06 E:0.052971 |  it and cleared by Pires but the whistle's gone, presumably for a foul, didn't see it myself,
[2151.28 - 2156.32] P:1772.75 E:0.048758 |  free kick to Arsenal. Yeah he seemed to go for the ball and Steve Dunn was blown very quickly
[2156.32 - 2159.44] P:1719.44 E:0.058415 |  because the ball locked in from the left hand side, there was two or three players, I think he
[2159.44 - 2164.56] P:1643.73 E:0.062490 |  went for it and I think he missed it. There we go, free kick to Arsenal, I think just at this
[2164.56 - 2168.24] P:1556.03 E:0.065065 |  moment I think you're right about Liverpool, I think they're just lacking a little bit of
[2168.24 - 2172.96] P:1582.30 E:0.064760 |  construction in the middle of the field to me and you know there's not much support really,
[2172.96 - 2176.88] P:1603.00 E:0.068333 |  when the ball is knocked over at the top and we've been watching people like Heskey and Owen have
[2176.88 - 2180.64] P:1643.47 E:0.059299 |  run out to the flank but you know there's been nothing there behind them when they've actually
[2180.64 - 2184.72] P:1739.45 E:0.053356 |  got the ball. Henry made his way to the left hand side, instinctively knowing Seaman's kick would
[2184.72 - 2189.04] P:1780.88 E:0.057855 |  be aimed towards him but then Wiltor gets into trouble and Liverpool try to escape and Dixon's
[2189.04 - 2195.52] P:1759.37 E:0.051141 |  just taken Schmitzer out of the game and that's a free kick to Liverpool inside the centre circle,
[2195.52 - 2200.88] P:1700.76 E:0.049118 |  Hermann knocks it to his fellow German Babel, they'll both be in Germany of course on Wednesday
[2200.88 - 2205.76] P:1684.62 E:0.052861 |  with Liverpool in the wafers cup, you'll hear that on five live, now Babel down the line to Murphy,
[2205.76 - 2210.40] P:1791.25 E:0.054351 |  Liverpool near Arsenal, near in the cup final still and we've 10 minutes left in the first half
[2210.40 - 2214.64] P:1765.22 E:0.050720 |  and it's just as tight as we thought it would be. Interesting Michael, we're just looking, we've played
[2214.72 - 2221.28] P:1722.49 E:0.050743 |  what 35 minutes now and David Seaman really has another shot to save so far, nothing really too
[2221.28 - 2225.36] P:1762.16 E:0.056911 |  much gone towards him, there's a couple of long long distance efforts, one very good one from a man
[2225.36 - 2230.16] P:1830.26 E:0.051836 |  that was blocked but nothing really much and that just because in general a little bit of concern
[2230.16 - 2235.44] P:1673.33 E:0.045820 |  I would have thought at this moment. Now Liverpool play it from right to left across the pitch to
[2235.44 - 2239.76] P:1736.51 E:0.052727 |  Carragher but he can't go forward, Lundberg's closing him down well and Sammy Huppier is there,
[2239.76 - 2244.24] P:1846.67 E:0.051524 |  that's a long left-footed ball by Huppier which Martin Keown's anticipating and again it just
[2244.24 - 2250.24] P:1821.10 E:0.059773 |  trickles away disappointingly for a goal kick to Arsenal, they've only met before today in the FA
[2250.24 - 2257.20] P:1708.39 E:0.051326 |  Cup once since that 1971 final and in those days they just used to keep playing on and they played
[2257.20 - 2263.92] P:1678.53 E:0.053396 |  four times eventually, they settled the semi-final back in 1980 when Brian Tolbert got the winner
[2263.92 - 2268.96] P:1728.30 E:0.054806 |  at Coventry for Arsenal and Arsenal went on to lose the final against Trevor Rooking in West Ham,
[2268.96 - 2274.64] P:1641.77 E:0.054419 |  here with just under 10 minutes left in the first half, Arsenal nil, Liverpool nil, Liverpool have
[2274.64 - 2280.00] P:1717.04 E:0.052150 |  got the much better record against Arsenal in recent years, it's Thierry Henry who should have scored,
[2280.00 - 2284.56] P:1794.05 E:0.055196 |  tries to flick the ball onto Pyrrhus, Murphy just nudges it out of play, Henry if you weren't with
[2284.56 - 2288.40] P:1739.70 E:0.052734 |  us earlier actually went round Vestervilt and then from the angle couldn't find the target.
[2289.04 - 2293.28] P:1789.60 E:0.058538 |  I think it was very difficult to tell off the replay even you know but his shots seemed to hit
[2293.28 - 2299.28] P:1702.66 E:0.053123 |  the post and then it caught on Sean the elbow and went away but it was the best chance certainly.
[2299.28 - 2304.00] P:1703.84 E:0.052048 |  Cole onto Pyrrhus left hand side, it's all the little slow and predictable though and
[2304.00 - 2309.04] P:1700.91 E:0.051379 |  Liverpool have got everybody back inside their own half, Grimondi just coaxes the ball back to
[2309.04 - 2315.44] P:1660.56 E:0.049393 |  Keown short of the half-way line, Keown lines up his options and then a nothing sort of ball
[2315.44 - 2320.88] P:1819.95 E:0.058147 |  really towards Thierry Henry and Babel just lets that one bounce and will measure a clearance for
[2320.88 - 2325.12] P:1735.55 E:0.054215 |  Liverpool towards Heskey on the half-way line, you will get it though Adams is in there first,
[2325.12 - 2329.36] P:1710.10 E:0.056378 |  header on by Vieira, Carrigas appealing for offside, the game continues though, Lungberg
[2329.36 - 2333.92] P:1777.60 E:0.060995 |  deserting his right-sided position, finds Dixon who's in that more authentic right-sided position
[2333.92 - 2339.12] P:1707.04 E:0.051324 |  now, Wiltord's waiting, the ball is played short to Lungberg, Lungberg onto Grimondi,
[2339.12 - 2344.40] P:1732.85 E:0.050915 |  Grimondi centre of the field slants it towards us down this near side to Ashley Cole, Cole now
[2344.40 - 2349.84] P:1693.96 E:0.053479 |  onto Henry edge of the area, two Liverpool players up against Henry back again to Ashley Cole,
[2349.84 - 2356.00] P:1727.46 E:0.050610 |  Wiltord, Lungberg, Pires all inside the penalty area, it's not coming in though and it's really
[2356.00 - 2361.52] P:1803.25 E:0.052774 |  summing up the game, it's KG stuff, Cattenmouth stuff, ball out of play once more Arsenal throwing
[2361.52 - 2365.76] P:1740.78 E:0.050603 |  back to Pires, Liverpool 0 Arsenal 0 in the cup final, Pires now running across the field with
[2365.76 - 2369.44] P:1718.99 E:0.052152 |  the ball taking Hermione with him, Wiltord doesn't control it all played too quickly though on the
[2369.44 - 2373.76] P:1754.55 E:0.058090 |  edge of the Liverpool penalty area but a poor clearance by Liverpool and the air is header now
[2373.76 - 2378.48] P:1697.52 E:0.053310 |  tries to find Pires down the right-hand side just keeps it in, Pires now onto Freddie Lungberg
[2378.48 - 2383.76] P:1799.01 E:0.048464 |  across comes Hermione, Lungberg turning with Didi Hermione, Steele Lungberg twisting and turning
[2383.76 - 2389.12] P:1767.66 E:0.051074 |  over on the touch line, on good play from Lungberg onto Grimondi, Grimondi thought about the cross
[2389.12 - 2394.00] P:1660.17 E:0.059472 |  and in the end he didn't get the cross in, that's gone behind the dead ball line for a goal kick to
[2394.00 - 2399.44] P:1694.02 E:0.056814 |  Liverpool that was a poor play in the end. Well Arsenal are what I would call say calling the
[2399.44 - 2402.96] P:1588.30 E:0.062412 |  shots at them on what they're doing they're actually pushing Liverpool back but Liverpool have
[2403.92 - 2409.12] P:1744.99 E:0.060596 |  really found everything they've had to do at the back, it's a good challenge there first of all
[2409.12 - 2414.80] P:1533.35 E:0.062836 |  from Carragher then from Hermione you know after they've been beaten but I think Arsenal you know
[2414.80 - 2418.80] P:1742.02 E:0.054340 |  just passing the ball around a little more confidently. Seven minutes to go in the first half
[2418.80 - 2422.64] P:1669.53 E:0.058069 |  and this time Arsenal don't clear it but the referee just gets in the way there before
[2422.64 - 2426.96] P:1720.97 E:0.048197 |  Smith's a compounds for Liverpool, Smith's are still dribbling well over his side, in the end he
[2426.96 - 2431.44] P:1751.58 E:0.051498 |  gives it back to Carragher the left back over on the far side, now into central midfield, Hermione
[2431.92 - 2438.24] P:1694.57 E:0.044292 |  has to go backwards, finds Stefan Ancho back inside his own half, cross the central defence it goes to
[2438.88 - 2443.68] P:1681.56 E:0.052763 |  Sammy Hopier and then Gerard helps it across to the far side the field just kept in by Carragher,
[2443.68 - 2449.28] P:1732.93 E:0.049612 |  Smith's are against Dixon and Dixon sticking tight to Smith's, Smith's although still continues
[2449.28 - 2454.24] P:1728.11 E:0.056397 |  with the ball onto Danny Murphy just didn't run for Murphy though Adams was there away to Pires,
[2454.24 - 2460.08] P:1723.24 E:0.058043 |  great defending by both sides and now Robert Pires once more, Pires onto Wiltord, Wiltord
[2460.08 - 2465.60] P:1712.40 E:0.054839 |  has got Ljungberg on the outside, Ljungberg's got it, faced by Steven Gerard, Ljungberg still
[2465.60 - 2470.40] P:1664.07 E:0.055589 |  holds, Wiltord's available down that right hand side, back again to Ljungberg again only Henri
[2470.40 - 2475.36] P:1777.90 E:0.054557 |  though downfield, Ljungberg back again to Wiltord, down the right hand side Ashley Cole's gone into
[2475.36 - 2480.72] P:1761.12 E:0.050350 |  the area, ball still with Sylvain Wiltord onto his left foot doesn't get the crossing up against
[2480.72 - 2485.76] P:1767.65 E:0.066788 |  Carragher and Carragher's done well the defender and Carragher's avoided the corner kick as well
[2486.48 - 2491.20] P:1836.37 E:0.069666 |  it's a goal kick to Liverpool. Well what happened there really has typified the last
[2491.20 - 2495.28] P:1719.35 E:0.060942 |  sort of quarter of an hour to me, Arsenal in possession of the ball, Liverpool finding a
[2495.28 - 2500.64] P:1628.10 E:0.062256 |  defender there, Carragher stuck at it and stuck at it and stuck at it and he actually won a goal
[2500.64 - 2509.68] P:1577.64 E:0.062771 |  kick in the end. St Johnston too, Dundee United, Mill in Scotland and for the neutral at the moment
[2509.68 - 2514.00] P:1599.11 E:0.050114 |  Jimmy it's not a spectacle this cup final. No but it's the interest factor isn't it,
[2514.32 - 2518.64] P:1702.69 E:0.056836 |  which is anything you know for the for the sets of fans here they come to see their team win the
[2518.64 - 2523.04] P:1770.65 E:0.052779 |  cup so there's terrific interest from that point of view and it's that sort of game, it's a cagey
[2523.04 - 2527.92] P:1721.58 E:0.052377 |  game of course because you've got two pretty evenly much sides, strong at the back and neither side
[2527.92 - 2534.00] P:1740.94 E:0.048336 |  at the moment being too committed to go forward. A game in which chances really have to be taken
[2534.00 - 2538.88] P:1629.93 E:0.050221 |  there are going to be few of them and Henri's missed the only real chance of this first half and
[2538.88 - 2545.04] P:1666.55 E:0.052473 |  will Arsenal live to regret it? Liverpool again just cagey bringing the ball forward. It's warm on
[2545.04 - 2548.72] P:1800.38 E:0.057642 |  the field as well Mike I think you know I think it's just sort of taking its toll a little bit
[2548.72 - 2554.32] P:1797.30 E:0.047634 |  just as we're coming towards half time. The big hoop here, the captain in the absence of Fowler
[2554.32 - 2558.72] P:1692.74 E:0.049254 |  and Redknapp onto Heskey, Heskey now to Schmitzer over on the left hand side, refer to Patrick Berger
[2558.72 - 2564.48] P:1707.95 E:0.047892 |  in the starting lineup. Schmitzer still sorting himself out up against Lungberg now and Grimondi,
[2564.48 - 2569.60] P:1695.53 E:0.048864 |  needs help finds Carragher so good in that left-sided defensive position this season for
[2569.60 - 2573.68] P:1713.20 E:0.062144 |  Liverpool. There's talk though of course of Lizard Rezou coming here, coming to Liverpool and now
[2573.68 - 2578.96] P:1703.71 E:0.055814 |  Liverpool change the direction and fine on show onto Gerard, Gerard can't get the ball past Pires
[2578.96 - 2583.44] P:1732.29 E:0.057650 |  and the ball falls kindly to Thierry Henri. Henri onto Wiltor, centre circle just didn't come onto
[2583.44 - 2588.00] P:1702.08 E:0.053733 |  him as quickly as he wanted though. Wiltor again a slow build up from Arsenal from midfield though.
[2588.00 - 2593.60] P:1733.34 E:0.050636 |  Lungberg again drifting in field and the initial promise of this move has lost its sparkle.
[2593.60 - 2598.32] P:1815.46 E:0.050848 |  Pires again, Pires against Murphy, good challenge from Murphy. Ashley Cole picks up the loose ball,
[2598.32 - 2603.12] P:1770.86 E:0.049656 |  feeds Grimondi on the half-way line. Lungberg just taps it back into his own half to Adams
[2603.12 - 2607.76] P:1651.23 E:0.052009 |  and Adams spreads the play and Dixon now wants the ball over on the right hand side. Still Liverpool
[2607.76 - 2612.56] P:1782.44 E:0.051673 |  nil, Arsenal nil, three and a half minutes to go in the first half. We haven't had the physios on
[2612.56 - 2617.60] P:1640.26 E:0.051745 |  in the first half so there shouldn't be a lot of added time, maybe just one token minute from Stephen
[2617.60 - 2623.12] P:1642.66 E:0.057051 |  Dunn. Tony Adams onto Ashley Cole, nil-nil, Ashley Cole this would be a good time now for either of
[2623.12 - 2630.08] P:1651.95 E:0.048431 |  these two sides to score. Right on half time it's Pires back again to Cole. Such a slow build up
[2630.08 - 2634.88] P:1655.38 E:0.054231 |  here from Arsenal and now Grimondi, everybody apart from Heskey back behind the ball. Grimondi's
[2634.88 - 2639.68] P:1751.36 E:0.051111 |  long ball, Henri's given off side, whistle's just gone as Henri thought he was going to cut through
[2640.40 - 2645.92] P:1698.79 E:0.049206 |  and it's now St. Miran 1, Aberdeen 1 in Scotland. Jimmy. Yes now I think the Liverpool fans behind
[2645.92 - 2649.52] P:1658.11 E:0.056899 |  De Westerville's goal have been quietly relieved at that. It was a nice little chip forward by
[2649.52 - 2653.92] P:1630.53 E:0.058523 |  Grimondi and Henri must have just gone a little bit early, chesting it down on the left hand side
[2653.92 - 2661.44] P:1641.72 E:0.049446 |  with the Lyons have been in a very good position. Westerville prepares to take this kick, free kick
[2661.44 - 2666.32] P:1645.68 E:0.052535 |  it was, five yards outside the penalty area, hits it long, another typical towering leap from
[2666.32 - 2672.40] P:1721.32 E:0.050020 |  Martin Keown and then Lundberg seem to be held off over on the far side and Arsenal are going to
[2672.40 - 2678.32] P:1728.90 E:0.049285 |  have a free kick still back inside their own half. Gerard Houlier, yeah this is interesting, he's
[2678.32 - 2682.56] P:1642.46 E:0.054774 |  coming off the bench and he's making that signal which usually means come on get up a gear or two
[2682.56 - 2687.60] P:1690.73 E:0.049849 |  here lads, it's time to lift his side up isn't he? Yes he is, I think it's the midfield area too you
[2687.60 - 2691.36] P:1707.72 E:0.057115 |  know which you'd be a little bit concerned about, I think he's one of two people thinking about coming
[2691.36 - 2696.16] P:1728.04 E:0.051295 |  on McAllister's 1, quite clearly looking across there, you know he's got one of two options,
[2696.16 - 2701.28] P:1782.33 E:0.049752 |  you've got Berger as well of course. It'd be interesting to see you know what he's thinking
[2701.28 - 2704.56] P:1736.86 E:0.057813 |  about at the break. Well I think, I mean Alan's just drawing my attention to the fact that
[2704.56 - 2708.96] P:1653.65 E:0.054955 |  McAllister's going through a lot of exercises inside that tunnel here at the moment. The ball
[2708.96 - 2713.28] P:1709.64 E:0.058027 |  though is with Arsenal, Cross comes in from Lundberg, very difficult ball for Babel to take that one
[2713.28 - 2717.36] P:1685.27 E:0.061087 |  inside the penalty area, my word he had to get that one right and he just drops it safely out of play
[2717.92 - 2723.76] P:1746.95 E:0.055360 |  for an Arsenal throw in and so a lot of stretching, exercising going on from Gary McAllister and
[2723.76 - 2729.12] P:1703.94 E:0.055742 |  Liverpool perhaps need his flair in midfield in this game. The ball is back again with Adams on
[2729.12 - 2732.88] P:1744.21 E:0.055098 |  the half wayline, it's just a little bit laborious at the moment, a little bit workman-like from
[2732.96 - 2739.92] P:1699.00 E:0.044952 |  both sides. The ball is with Grimondi onto Dixon just inside the Liverpool half, Dixon over to
[2739.92 - 2744.08] P:1674.80 E:0.051911 |  Freddie Lundberg, ask him at the moment more of an attacking threat, Liverpool more or less in the
[2744.08 - 2749.60] P:1723.01 E:0.050113 |  last 10-15 minutes or so counter attacking and with quite a few long balls, Keo now down the
[2749.60 - 2754.80] P:1683.14 E:0.055385 |  centre, too high for Wiltord, away by Stephanon Scho, oh and the whistle's gone for Foulby-Heskey
[2754.80 - 2759.36] P:1747.63 E:0.058641 |  and the air has taken the free kick very quickly, who's played it into a crowded area, Wiltord can't
[2759.36 - 2763.68] P:1816.62 E:0.058386 |  find Ashley Cole, it's a great challenge on the ground from Marcus Babel, Babel's going to try and
[2763.68 - 2771.60] P:1753.43 E:0.065152 |  run the ball clear here and he's been fouled by Ashley Cole. Yes it was a foul, I mean it was good
[2771.60 - 2775.36] P:1648.16 E:0.061183 |  play by Babel that, it was a very good clearance just a moment ago when the ball came across from
[2775.36 - 2779.76] P:1724.75 E:0.053052 |  the right, he just sort of helped it on on the volley, difficult ball for a defender that, he's
[2779.76 - 2784.64] P:1743.87 E:0.056758 |  got to get it right as you said Mike, but looking across there, McAllister is warming up in the
[2784.64 - 2788.08] P:1782.91 E:0.058719 |  tunnel over there, sometimes you know the craft he plays, you know that's a way of a signal to tell
[2788.08 - 2791.84] P:1698.98 E:0.055908 |  the coach I'm ready to come on. Well me presumably for the second half he's not going to come on now,
[2791.84 - 2797.44] P:1605.29 E:0.051304 |  we've got 25 seconds of normal time and we'll try and pick out in the sunshine the fourth
[2797.44 - 2801.76] P:1588.71 E:0.051985 |  officials sign over on the far side but I can't believe it'll be more than a minute of added time.
[2802.32 - 2808.40] P:1747.62 E:0.055955 |  Long ball now from Liverpool and an easy catch for David Seaman who really, Jim,
[2809.20 - 2813.04] P:1638.70 E:0.057880 |  David Seaman I mean he's had nothing to do at all really, has he? No he hasn't, he just had that
[2813.04 - 2816.88] P:1629.38 E:0.056691 |  one awkward cross that he came out to you know that he missed completely,
[2817.44 - 2822.40] P:1666.57 E:0.053436 |  but he is a signal mark for the time factor. Can't see it from here can you? I think it's a
[2822.40 - 2827.76] P:1655.15 E:0.046174 |  minute isn't it? It has to be right, one minute which is pretty standard really when you haven't
[2827.76 - 2833.04] P:1715.74 E:0.050739 |  had the physios on the tour so one minute of added time and we have just moved into that now here in
[2833.04 - 2837.68] P:1717.27 E:0.053626 |  Cardiff, halftime, Liverpool near Arsenal, looks like that's going to be the score line, Marcus
[2837.68 - 2841.76] P:1672.19 E:0.056703 |  Babel last chance maybe for either of these two teams, good control from Babel down the right
[2841.76 - 2846.72] P:1750.98 E:0.056258 |  hand side, Babel's ball in the area asking an awful lot of Heskey and Murphy, wasn't well laid off
[2846.72 - 2851.68] P:1810.56 E:0.055117 |  there by Babel and he knew it as well and it's a goal kick once more to Seaman away to our right.
[2851.68 - 2856.24] P:1734.20 E:0.055177 |  Well those all campaigners at the back for Arsenal have looked very good, you know the three of them
[2856.24 - 2862.24] P:1740.65 E:0.053393 |  there, and Ashley, young Ashley Cole as well but the three in front of him, Dixon, Keown and Adams
[2862.24 - 2867.20] P:1700.34 E:0.053783 |  look very strong, they've protected Seaman very well, it's been very difficult for Rowan and Heskey
[2867.20 - 2873.52] P:1718.56 E:0.059110 |  in this first half. Now that goes the halftime whistle at the Millennium Stadium, Seaman
[2873.52 - 2878.40] P:1758.56 E:0.062144 |  applauds the Arsenal fans away to our right hand side, we've seen this many times over the years,
[2878.96 - 2883.68] P:1708.15 E:0.058728 |  he got off to a really promising start Jimmy didn't it, we didn't get the early goal and then it just
[2883.68 - 2888.00] P:1711.89 E:0.057282 |  fell into a rather predictable path. Yes I think the conditions you know have something to do with
[2888.00 - 2893.04] P:1877.08 E:0.057201 |  that, I've always believed that you know it's very hot, you know it is warmed down on the field today,
[2893.04 - 2897.04] P:1813.29 E:0.058960 |  then it does take its effect on the game itself as the half progresses, a little bit
[2897.44 - 2902.16] P:1830.43 E:0.061215 |  player fatigue comes into it, but I thought Arsenal shared that first half, I thought there was much
[2902.16 - 2906.80] P:1695.51 E:0.063127 |  more progression in their play and I think at this moment in time Jared Hulley will be getting
[2906.80 - 2911.04] P:1832.34 E:0.059063 |  trying to sort his midfield out because there's been very little or no support to the two front
[2911.04 - 2915.44] P:1894.71 E:0.055444 |  players who've had to really chase long balls and it's been very difficult, Arsenal's defence has
[2915.44 - 2920.64] P:1838.03 E:0.051442 |  looked very strong. Well this is the point really where I need Stuart Hall because the halftime
[2920.64 - 2932.00] P:1779.12 E:0.059471 |  score is Liverpool Null, Arsenal Null. You're listening to Sports World in the BBC World Service,
[2932.00 - 2937.52] P:1790.25 E:0.055250 |  we'll be back at the Millennium Stadium in good time for the second half of the Cup Final, no goals
[2937.52 - 2942.88] P:1965.80 E:0.047418 |  so far in Cardiff, we've also got plenty of other sports events to tell you about Formula One Cricket
[2942.88 - 2953.20] P:1540.26 E:0.040330 |  and Tennis for example. We're underway and Liverpool will be attacking the end to our left
[2953.20 - 2957.92] P:1463.33 E:0.046856 |  behind which is the River Taff here in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and here's Jared and
[2958.56 - 2962.32] P:1375.82 E:0.046854 |  Liverpool certainly need to show more adventure in this second half, bubble on the right side but
[2962.32 - 2968.00] P:1243.38 E:0.040870 |  Jared's pass was over and it's out of play, I agree with Jan Mulvey, Jimmy, I think it'll
[2968.80 - 2973.52] P:1345.53 E:0.045319 |  be Calistro beyond probably for Murphy within five or ten minutes. I didn't understand the
[2973.52 - 2978.32] P:1228.76 E:0.050897 |  selects to Murphy in the first place. Well I think the really heavily attacking from the attacking
[2978.32 - 2983.44] P:1279.16 E:0.052187 |  point of view, really Murphy, awesome mix really hasn't really got into the game so far and I'm sure
[2983.44 - 2987.28] P:1252.91 E:0.045528 |  you know Jared Ulli's talked a little bit about that you know during the break you know you've got
[2987.28 - 2991.04] P:1138.07 E:0.044797 |  to try and get these two into the game, we'll give them a period see if they can have any effect.
[2991.12 - 2997.04] P:1185.64 E:0.038770 |  Gremondi caught by Hamann who'd slipped from a previous challenge and it's a free kick to Arsenal
[2997.76 - 3003.68] P:988.31 E:0.040928 |  inside their own half, it's been interesting but I've got to say it's another of these dull finals
[3004.24 - 3010.32] P:1051.80 E:0.042915 |  so let's hope the second half livens up enormously. The ball is with Tony Adams our Arsenal skipper
[3011.60 - 3016.56] P:1185.66 E:0.041378 |  inside his own half still short of the centre circle and I move forward and he clips it right
[3016.56 - 3024.08] P:1155.02 E:0.034663 |  foot it towards Ashley Cole on the left played back by Cole to Wilthorne and now here's Perez
[3024.08 - 3028.88] P:1113.02 E:0.040532 |  onto Ashley Cole again not over the edge of the Liverpool penalty area he's tackled by
[3028.88 - 3035.04] P:1180.52 E:0.038789 |  Babel Fogels at a play and it's a throw in to Arsenal, Arsenal attacking the end behind which
[3035.04 - 3041.68] P:1151.80 E:0.043128 |  the bulk of their supporters are. Cole in the sunshine in the far side and in the sunshine it's
[3041.68 - 3046.96] P:1247.34 E:0.043662 |  very hot here in Cardiff, the throw in goes to Wilthorne, Wilthorne with a man close by,
[3046.96 - 3051.20] P:1316.54 E:0.047022 |  Wilthorne's done well and then he must have overrun that ball surely, finally the linesman raises his
[3051.20 - 3057.44] P:1294.47 E:0.044994 |  flag and it's a goal kick to Liverpool. They're tight there even for Wilthorne, terrific pace,
[3057.44 - 3061.52] P:1226.92 E:0.052601 |  terrific acceleration, he got past a couple of challenges but he just couldn't keep it in play.
[3062.32 - 3066.56] P:1269.04 E:0.055314 |  I would have thought the important thing for Liverpool you know we should try and get the ball
[3066.56 - 3070.48] P:1190.23 E:0.056307 |  pass it around a little bit in the central area of the field, try and get the feel a bit a little
[3070.56 - 3074.16] P:1232.91 E:0.055926 |  bit better than they did in the first half that's what I would have said to if I'd have been Jared
[3074.16 - 3078.48] P:1300.79 E:0.053400 |  Hurley at the break. You just think the World Service and Five Limes in the BBC Arsenal little
[3078.48 - 3084.40] P:1349.60 E:0.049067 |  Liverpool and on the Cop Final, the FA Cop Final was that a little nudge by Keona and Owen, Owen
[3084.40 - 3088.96] P:1399.86 E:0.048042 |  regained his footing and now he's got Ashley Cole the battle within the far side and even though
[3088.96 - 3094.16] P:1445.20 E:0.048640 |  the linesman indicated it was a throw in the referee Steve Dunn saw some tugging by Cole and
[3094.16 - 3098.96] P:1327.20 E:0.048313 |  Owen and awards a free kick to Liverpool. I think the referee's right, what a free kick, I thought it
[3099.76 - 3106.48] P:1357.14 E:0.049994 |  really was a bit of immature to be able to give Cole a free kick away in that situation. Now Murphy
[3106.48 - 3111.12] P:1427.76 E:0.043679 |  was going to take this from the right and Hopi and Barber inside the penalty area played in deep,
[3111.12 - 3116.64] P:1424.66 E:0.043515 |  Heskey with the header, great save by statement, should have been 1-0 Liverpool, good reflex action
[3116.64 - 3121.84] P:1328.37 E:0.049472 |  for Meaglin goalkeeper and now Hopi adjusted right in the penalty area seemed to foul an Arsenal
[3121.84 - 3126.32] P:1321.49 E:0.052526 |  penalty team, well maybe he didn't think it was a foul at all but it has been given free kick to
[3126.32 - 3131.36] P:1363.12 E:0.050213 |  Arsenal but chance for Liverpool. Yes well the free kick came in there and for the first time
[3131.36 - 3136.40] P:1289.73 E:0.052408 |  really Heskey got free of Keon, he got the header in alright it was a bit difficult for him because
[3136.40 - 3141.84] P:1243.17 E:0.054767 |  he was a little bit of pressure, Seaman who's had to make his first real save there, just a warning
[3141.84 - 3147.28] P:1273.61 E:0.056679 |  for us, somebody who's a good save, very important save. Well actually the Heskey header in retrospect
[3147.28 - 3153.28] P:1188.65 E:0.056475 |  was probably too close to be a big problem but you've got to keep them out, balls on the halfway
[3153.28 - 3160.24] P:1401.32 E:0.054666 |  line with Fierro and Fierro, oh well he was tackled by all Fierro and the referee decides that's a
[3160.24 - 3164.32] P:1361.32 E:0.051002 |  foul and a free kick. Yes he's given it for a push, this is anything but there we go, Fierro went down,
[3164.96 - 3170.80] P:1322.96 E:0.045454 |  referee Steve Dunn was only about five bases away, here's Perez for Arsenal after that free kick
[3170.80 - 3176.64] P:1435.99 E:0.047360 |  and doesn't control it and Haman latches it over the halfway line, Adams heads it in the sunshine,
[3176.64 - 3181.92] P:1392.20 E:0.054354 |  how did it play and it's a throw in to Liverpool. Just shows all the you know the ball that Arsenal
[3181.92 - 3186.72] P:1278.80 E:0.054465 |  had in the first half there and Liverpool could easily have been ahead, just one moment really
[3186.72 - 3191.84] P:1331.00 E:0.057270 |  indecision, Keon, you couldn't get to it, Heskey got there and Seaman saved his team. I know you say
[3191.84 - 3198.08] P:1304.70 E:0.054813 |  Jimmy, but actually Liverpool has more shots than Arsenal in the first half, two each on target
[3198.08 - 3202.80] P:1379.94 E:0.050353 |  and two off targets from Liverpool, one off target from Arsenal. They don't get enough
[3202.80 - 3206.48] P:1327.58 E:0.048843 |  pleasure in the penalty area Arsenal when they're playing away from home and this is away from home
[3206.48 - 3209.76] P:1304.91 E:0.051580 |  for them. Yeah they just have a lot of possession really and they seem to be to be carrying more
[3209.76 - 3214.24] P:1333.88 E:0.050198 |  of a threat although it should be fair, it never really came, there wasn't that much went
[3214.24 - 3218.56] P:1369.63 E:0.050902 |  to Vestamela's goal if you take it as well. Babo to Haman, it's getting a little bit aggressive
[3218.56 - 3224.16] P:1432.52 E:0.050056 |  out there and he's brought down by Lumber, free kick to Liverpool, short of the halfway line
[3224.80 - 3230.64] P:1308.11 E:0.051775 |  and we played nearly five minutes to the second half, Arsenal little Liverpool now,
[3230.64 - 3238.16] P:1396.91 E:0.047661 |  Carragher for Liverpool and they're a waist strip of goal shirts with blue flashes, navy flashes,
[3238.16 - 3244.48] P:1332.17 E:0.051853 |  navy shorts, Arsenal of course in red and white. Now it's with Altschok, on to Murphy, he's got a
[3244.48 - 3250.48] P:1396.06 E:0.044504 |  little bit of room inside right shallon, played it behind Heskey and killed with the back pass
[3250.48 - 3256.40] P:1369.50 E:0.043962 |  to Seaman and Murphy likes to come in from the flank so he doesn't really provide with that
[3256.40 - 3262.24] P:1376.71 E:0.046167 |  sort of dismissor down the left hand side. Altschok, head Seaman's clearance back to the half way line,
[3262.32 - 3268.16] P:1378.84 E:0.046875 |  Vieira juggles with the ball and plays it to the left to Ashley Cole, Cole on to Wilthorne,
[3268.16 - 3273.12] P:1416.35 E:0.049158 |  back to Cole and to Pires who's tackle and foul from behind by Haman, that definitely is a free kick.
[3274.16 - 3279.52] P:1415.41 E:0.049397 |  That's not even the other card though, but he's letting go, nice and lean to change down the left
[3279.52 - 3286.48] P:1337.06 E:0.044504 |  hand side by Arsenal and Haman came in from behind, Pires is on his feet and it's going to be a free
[3286.48 - 3290.96] P:1428.49 E:0.047778 |  kick to be taken by Ashley Cole, Wilthorne and Ornby look around the edge of the penalty area,
[3290.96 - 3294.80] P:1467.69 E:0.046899 |  played short to Pires, Pires and Vieira on to the edge of the penalty, headed to Wilthorne,
[3294.80 - 3299.76] P:1453.10 E:0.053505 |  Wilthorne shot blocked by Babel and it's behind for a corner, well that was a very slight move from
[3299.76 - 3304.96] P:1320.00 E:0.056507 |  Arsenal, a lovely touch on by Ornby and Wilthorne got on to the volley as well and Babel who's,
[3304.96 - 3309.84] P:1353.20 E:0.052502 |  I think he's played well so far Babel and he just blocked it, he's gone off for a corner kick,
[3310.64 - 3314.32] P:1382.73 E:0.050804 |  he's played in the last three German cup finals as Marcus Babel for Bayern Munich
[3315.04 - 3319.20] P:1278.55 E:0.050622 |  and here in his second success of final in England for Liverpool,
[3320.40 - 3325.52] P:1385.18 E:0.047125 |  corner to Arsenal in front of their fans, away to Arn right, Perez to take it,
[3325.52 - 3329.76] P:1494.02 E:0.045707 |  Adams jockeying for position, so to is Vieira and Kjohn, played indeed towards Tony,
[3329.76 - 3334.40] P:1333.50 E:0.046239 |  other festivals nowhere and then Vieira heads the ball, Kjohn heads it down, into the penalty
[3334.40 - 3338.80] P:1483.60 E:0.050177 |  area, Wilthorne slips as he tried to take on Orncio and Orncio just allows the ball to trickle behind
[3338.80 - 3344.16] P:1528.11 E:0.049776 |  for a goal kick, I think it's in a very tight match like this, it's very important really,
[3344.16 - 3347.84] P:1289.96 E:0.051399 |  defenders you know keep the discipline at corner kicks, free kicks and so on,
[3348.48 - 3352.24] P:1414.60 E:0.053386 |  another opportunity there could have come across but in the end it just fiddled out because Wilthorne
[3352.24 - 3357.12] P:1447.34 E:0.050152 |  slipped, Vistabell took that goal kick very hurriedly and Arsenal have the ball back now,
[3357.12 - 3361.84] P:1420.39 E:0.047361 |  on the far side with Thierry Henri, left of the Liverpool penalty, moving in field and brought
[3361.84 - 3368.80] P:1465.45 E:0.055035 |  down and that's a free kick against a challenge by Stephan Orncio, yeah it was
[3368.80 - 3371.68] P:1358.43 E:0.053622 |  lovely play by Henri, just dipped his shoulder there, it was just a bit of a
[3372.48 - 3377.12] P:1285.02 E:0.053586 |  it was a bit of a drag back more than anything else by Orncio but it's about six yards outside the
[3377.12 - 3384.96] P:1327.97 E:0.054208 |  box, very close to the touch line, Robert Perez to take the free kick for Arsenal, here it comes,
[3384.96 - 3388.24] P:1480.20 E:0.043052 |  right footer chipped in, Vistabell punches when he should have called it perhaps,
[3388.88 - 3394.56] P:1407.77 E:0.051606 |  but the punches clear of the penalty area and now it's with Hamar who plays it cleverly off
[3396.24 - 3400.32] P:1439.76 E:0.052305 |  Lumberg, out of play for Etra O'Hent to Liverpool, important thing is for the goalkeeper there,
[3400.32 - 3405.76] P:1279.88 E:0.049909 |  he got it away as much as anything else, he got his fist onto the ball but he got it away and
[3405.76 - 3413.68] P:1353.76 E:0.048362 |  Liverpool have managed to scramble it, it started at a terrific pace again Jimmy, but not so now,
[3413.76 - 3419.92] P:1373.93 E:0.051591 |  I see Patrick Berger is out running around joining Gary McAllister behind David Siemens goal and
[3419.92 - 3424.80] P:1380.62 E:0.045379 |  Cal is one of the Arsenal substitutes limbering up at the moment, Arsenal little Liverpool
[3424.80 - 3429.68] P:1419.38 E:0.039690 |  now, Schmitzer for Liverpool, back to Gerard who started brightly and then has gone quiet,
[3429.68 - 3434.56] P:1449.40 E:0.043749 |  good pass to the far side though to Babel and Babel, tackled by Colbert Winslow-Paul,
[3434.56 - 3438.80] P:1451.98 E:0.054609 |  Babel moves in field now he's tackled and losing at the Viera, the error onto Wilter,
[3438.80 - 3443.28] P:1446.34 E:0.045924 |  Wilter down the far side Gerard tracking him back, Wilter cutting in field, gives it to
[3443.28 - 3448.48] P:1488.74 E:0.047522 |  Freddie Lumberg, 30 yards out no room for the shot there, tackled by Hamann and by Hoppea,
[3448.48 - 3452.88] P:1497.52 E:0.052135 |  ball breaks the Perez, edge of the penalty here, now running into the penalty area, Perez has the
[3452.88 - 3457.76] P:1489.89 E:0.054384 |  ball, Perez takes on Carragher, Carragher goes well, cuts his foot in and diverts it behind for a
[3457.76 - 3461.68] P:1391.32 E:0.055475 |  corner, that was very good play by Arsenal, particularly by Perez, switching from left to
[3461.68 - 3467.04] P:1426.12 E:0.048719 |  right but Carragher kept his feet, did extremely well there, he had to time that tackle absolutely
[3467.04 - 3471.28] P:1271.93 E:0.055328 |  perfectly, could easily be one of those where you miss the ball and get the player but he got the
[3471.68 - 3477.60] P:1264.68 E:0.050832 |  ball corner kick, it's all red behind Vastarbalt's goal, the Arsenal red as Perez takes the corner,
[3477.60 - 3482.64] P:1433.28 E:0.047290 |  right footed, chipped in headed away by Hoppea for Liverpool and dropping to Robert Perez again,
[3482.64 - 3489.28] P:1432.03 E:0.046551 |  Gerard comes out to meet him but Perez crosses the ball and again, dive by Omri towards the ball,
[3489.28 - 3494.40] P:1465.69 E:0.045472 |  didn't make contact, cleared by Liverpool, collected by Col, nice little spell this for Arsenal,
[3494.40 - 3500.72] P:1443.51 E:0.043684 |  back to Dixon, Dixon chips it towards Perez, Perez heads it onto the penalty area and the call
[3500.72 - 3505.12] P:1393.00 E:0.052955 |  from Vastarbalt to Hoppea says leave it to me, they looked at good ball really when it was played
[3505.12 - 3509.04] P:1357.48 E:0.053379 |  out there but it's very difficult to head on to get the ball towards your own play, small
[3509.04 - 3519.12] P:1346.61 E:0.042790 |  distance out wide, here's Antje for Liverpool, to the Liverpool captain, Hoppea and Neza Tahmar,
[3519.12 - 3524.24] P:1295.79 E:0.052178 |  we played nearly 10 minutes of the second half and a sun drenched card of the Millennium Stadium,
[3524.24 - 3530.16] P:1323.56 E:0.048399 |  Arsenal, Liverpool, back to Hoppea and Nomnof moving up front from Liverpool,
[3530.16 - 3535.84] P:1445.04 E:0.043926 |  Hoppea's pass to Schmitzer was awful and won by Grimondi and taken up by Freddie Lumberg,
[3535.84 - 3540.56] P:1432.25 E:0.043902 |  rolling down the right hand side, Hamann's back there to help out, Carragher, Lumberg still
[3540.56 - 3544.72] P:1490.50 E:0.050042 |  has the ball, Hamann gets in and wins it and then Lumberg falls in, that's a free kick.
[3546.24 - 3549.68] P:1432.44 E:0.055094 |  Yes and that's been typical of what's happened throughout a lot of this game, particularly in
[3549.68 - 3554.56] P:1412.21 E:0.049796 |  the last 20 minutes of the first half and in this early period of the second half where
[3555.12 - 3559.28] P:1310.14 E:0.050100 |  the player breaks from midfield and he's outnumbered, he's no chance of getting through there,
[3559.28 - 3564.72] P:1375.76 E:0.057711 |  Lumberg, a bit of frustration in the Angerway free kick, you can only imagine with the heat
[3564.72 - 3570.80] P:1307.31 E:0.060555 |  and the pace of the game and so on and because of the actual involvement with it being the FA
[3570.80 - 3575.44] P:1299.03 E:0.062542 |  final, you've got to think that there will be substitutions in this match. Besterbilt takes
[3575.44 - 3580.72] P:1363.53 E:0.059166 |  the free kick, he can see himself taking it on the giant screen behind Siemens Gould,
[3580.72 - 3587.20] P:1447.63 E:0.052718 |  headed away by Keown for Arsenal, to Perez and Perez on to Wilton, inside Liverpool territory now,
[3587.20 - 3591.84] P:1488.35 E:0.043955 |  on show close by, Wilton retreats and then that's a good little pass to Perez,
[3591.84 - 3596.56] P:1475.99 E:0.049891 |  Wilton's available on the left side but instead the ball is aimed at Ornry, divided away by Hopien
[3596.56 - 3601.60] P:1533.81 E:0.054655 |  and Liverpool can't do a tack, Schmitzer has got Orn and Heskey with him, oh good tackle by Vieira,
[3602.48 - 3607.28] P:1512.01 E:0.057658 |  excellent challenge, winning the ball off Schmitzer and now an exchange of passes between
[3607.28 - 3613.20] P:1502.22 E:0.051219 |  Vieira and Perez and it's taken off by Ornry, Wilton is furthest forward, Ornry cuts in field,
[3613.20 - 3618.80] P:1501.90 E:0.049466 |  back kills the ball to Vieira and now wide to the right to Lumberg, into Vieira again,
[3618.80 - 3624.96] P:1341.64 E:0.053318 |  pulls in a good place in the far side to Perez, Arsenal dominating the second half so far,
[3624.96 - 3629.44] P:1474.92 E:0.050522 |  to Ornry, 30 yards some goal, he's juggling the ball beautifully, now breaks to Perez,
[3629.44 - 3633.60] P:1587.05 E:0.053063 |  Perez into the penalty, Ornry's onside is he, it comes best of all he makes the save, half
[3634.32 - 3640.72] P:1543.93 E:0.062528 |  clear, clear off the line by Arsenal, don't player, it was Ornry who cleared it, as Ashley Cole
[3640.72 - 3649.20] P:1463.12 E:0.060239 |  scored a shot goal, it hit Ornry or even Henry, well it was a what a chance that was, the ball
[3649.20 - 3654.80] P:1316.06 E:0.055595 |  actually went, went past and Houpier was there too as well on the line, it was Hopien, not Ornry,
[3654.80 - 3658.16] P:1286.00 E:0.059028 |  yes, Houpier was the man on the goal line, he was the man who saved it but really will
[3658.24 - 3662.16] P:1400.28 E:0.061262 |  touch it and buried that, when the ball broke two in there after the Gumpfoss
[3662.16 - 3666.80] P:1290.83 E:0.057340 |  Festival then the three bound came over and the shot came in from Will Tad, I thought he
[3666.80 - 3670.96] P:1389.50 E:0.058752 |  should have buried it, he side-footed it, Houpier got back on the line and saved Liverpool,
[3672.56 - 3679.12] P:1368.67 E:0.061291 |  I think it was actually Cole by the way Jimmy, Cole, I got the clearance wrong, it's all right,
[3679.12 - 3684.08] P:1490.74 E:0.062704 |  one one, all that matters is it was cleared off the line, it was, I hope you, there's a foul by
[3684.16 - 3689.92] P:1632.09 E:0.053027 |  Murphy, free kick to Arsenal, they were definitely in the ascendancy at the moment, but when it goes
[3691.44 - 3696.72] P:1620.62 E:0.053482 |  to Ornry, Ornry tackled again and some mad challenges going in there and then the referee
[3697.36 - 3703.12] P:1545.80 E:0.057771 |  spot something, I don't know what the decision is, is it a foul on Hermann or a foul by Hermann,
[3703.84 - 3708.80] P:1519.48 E:0.049243 |  it's going to be a yellow card, is it, reaching into his right pocket and G. Mark Hermann's going
[3708.80 - 3713.68] P:1491.45 E:0.053849 |  to be the first club book in the 2001 Cup fight, yes he already had a word, he's over the foul
[3713.68 - 3719.68] P:1410.25 E:0.055353 |  on the half-way line earlier, anyway there he was, it's going to be a free kick, about 15 yards
[3719.68 - 3723.92] P:1473.42 E:0.055974 |  outside the box to the left, Arsenal at this moment and Ollins just told you they're in the
[3723.92 - 3729.44] P:1454.04 E:0.054813 |  ascendancy again, which is why McCallister's got to come on very shortly, he's spoken to at the
[3729.44 - 3734.72] P:1448.19 E:0.059050 |  moment by Gerard Hullier and he still hasn't got his goal shirt on but he will have soon,
[3735.92 - 3743.28] P:1427.85 E:0.054540 |  13 minutes played in the second half, Arsenal nil, Liverpool nil, shot driven in, what a waste,
[3744.00 - 3750.40] P:1607.65 E:0.053011 |  what a waste from Thierry Omri, what was the point of that, it was a brave attempt, anyway
[3750.40 - 3754.48] P:1560.87 E:0.049902 |  there it goes, sorry brave what you're saying, I would have used the word stupid, from that range
[3754.48 - 3759.52] P:1477.35 E:0.049128 |  and that angle, he's got to be the clearance, but it's an amazing series of events really and the
[3759.52 - 3765.76] P:1480.43 E:0.048960 |  ball, when the ball actually went past Vestamel, it came to Cole and he got his left foot onto it
[3765.76 - 3770.24] P:1381.26 E:0.055412 |  and it was going in definitely about, no question about that and who here was the man on the line,
[3770.24 - 3775.12] P:1457.91 E:0.052265 |  got his left foot to it, just enough and Liverpool scrambled it away and they need to do something
[3775.12 - 3780.56] P:1510.46 E:0.050357 |  now and well that's the reason I think for McCallister, coming up and standing on the sideline,
[3781.12 - 3785.52] P:1554.42 E:0.053300 |  well that was surely followed by Babel and Pires but the referee way play on,
[3786.24 - 3791.36] P:1522.93 E:0.048070 |  Vieira, the Pires on the far side and the next time the ball goes dead, McCallister will be on,
[3792.24 - 3798.32] P:1533.51 E:0.050074 |  Vieira to Lumberg and Lumberg lifts it further forward but beyond Omri and out comes Vestamel,
[3798.40 - 3802.48] P:1491.20 E:0.050244 |  he gathers it, now who would you take off, I take off Murphy, who would you take off,
[3802.48 - 3806.08] P:1334.37 E:0.058154 |  yes well they can take out the Murphy Auschwitz because neither of them can get in the game as
[3806.08 - 3811.52] P:1383.72 E:0.057237 |  an attacking player at the present time but I think that's the possibility, Carragher onto
[3811.52 - 3817.44] P:1478.09 E:0.053592 |  Heskey midway inside the arc, Heskey holds off at him, Heskey runs in, and then it's played
[3817.44 - 3821.44] P:1557.80 E:0.055905 |  in towards Owen and I'll tell you what the referee might have given a free kick there,
[3821.44 - 3827.44] P:1616.63 E:0.048549 |  yes just a bit of a tug coming back, a bit better from Liverpool, Vieira onto Grimondi,
[3828.00 - 3831.68] P:1505.75 E:0.056333 |  Grimondi to the halfway line and Lumberg and maybe as the players are getting a little bit
[3831.68 - 3836.96] P:1542.08 E:0.051261 |  tired we're nearly an hour through this game and all this heat and it's going to open up a little bit
[3836.96 - 3844.16] P:1605.27 E:0.054384 |  and Grimondi, a stripper sheltered that ball to go behind, Grimondi within the silly challenge but
[3844.16 - 3850.16] P:1636.07 E:0.056806 |  here comes McCallister and I can't see in the light which number's being held up but it's got to be Murphy,
[3850.16 - 3863.76] P:1608.98 E:0.059755 |  it's going to change the formation I would have thought it would be made in,
[3863.76 - 3868.96] P:1627.51 E:0.056075 |  he has to leave the formation the way it is Jimmy, I wonder whether first when he might have put
[3868.96 - 3873.12] P:1605.70 E:0.055786 |  Gerrard out onto the right hand side bring McCallister and we've heard him but he hasn't done it,
[3873.12 - 3877.76] P:1635.76 E:0.054234 |  I thought he might have done that, no he hasn't changed the formation at all, no I just thought
[3877.76 - 3883.20] P:1576.27 E:0.050127 |  he might have given a little bit of mobility down the right hand side, there we go, well I'm surprised
[3883.20 - 3886.96] P:1528.77 E:0.052317 |  that Murphy's selection and amazed that he's being retained but maybe he'll score the winner for
[3886.96 - 3891.68] P:1468.25 E:0.052786 |  Liverpool, here's Babel on the far side his play resumes and McCallister has been the man of the
[3891.68 - 3897.36] P:1644.45 E:0.044909 |  last few weeks for Liverpool is on a substitute, on it goes to Owen, Owen spins but loses control
[3897.36 - 3903.52] P:1520.35 E:0.047278 |  of the ball in the same moment and moment and Cole clears over the halfway line, on show for Liverpool
[3904.48 - 3909.84] P:1521.89 E:0.056644 |  Murphy and Murphy hustled out of it, what a great ball but here's Arstow and it's four against three
[3909.84 - 3916.00] P:1517.03 E:0.056180 |  here, Omri must be offside against Perez, a very foolish play by Robert Perez, he can look along
[3916.00 - 3920.64] P:1537.25 E:0.050520 |  the line and the few people are in that Liverpool defence and it's silly being beyond them, well
[3920.64 - 3925.12] P:1482.38 E:0.051223 |  he just went a little bit too early there you know if he just held off, if he just held off that was
[3925.12 - 3930.24] P:1475.64 E:0.051595 |  a great opportunity because Liverpool lost possession on the halfway line, it wasn't a good ball that
[3930.24 - 3936.24] P:1459.87 E:0.055139 |  was played to Murphy and it broke down and if Perez had just stayed onside at four on three there
[3936.24 - 3940.64] P:1473.72 E:0.060003 |  they really had a great opportunity, some of my thoughts on what about McCallister you know
[3940.64 - 3945.92] P:1493.12 E:0.058765 |  saying they'll put Gerard now I think in a mom's role and I think sometimes you know if you
[3945.92 - 3950.00] P:1584.38 E:0.051484 |  if you sometimes put him out on the right he gets a bit more room I think sometimes to play free
[3950.64 - 3956.40] P:1597.90 E:0.043307 |  there we go, clearance upfield by Besterbilt, McCallister jumps, drops to Heskey, Heskey back
[3956.40 - 3962.24] P:1613.28 E:0.042390 |  to Carragher and Carragher on to Schmitzer and Schmitzer takes on Dixon Beatsom, Lumberg's back
[3962.24 - 3965.92] P:1591.01 E:0.060955 |  there and Lumberg with a food challenge on Schmitzer and that should be a yellow card
[3967.28 - 3973.68] P:1645.03 E:0.057179 |  yep he's got a book on deck coming yeah he's got a book out here Steve, already knows
[3974.64 - 3978.72] P:1634.63 E:0.053684 |  he knows he's pulled him back yeah because Schmitzer actually what he he ran across him
[3978.72 - 3984.24] P:1619.95 E:0.054955 |  as well which made it all the more difficult for Jürgen Berg, there we go, well a key influence
[3984.24 - 3990.32] P:1528.86 E:0.045094 |  and Lumberg pulls recent run of success has been McCallister's delivery from free kicks either
[3990.32 - 3995.68] P:1582.93 E:0.051188 |  directly on goal or in terms of a free kick like this which is wide on the left hand side
[3996.80 - 4001.12] P:1529.63 E:0.049374 |  Hope you mix the run to the near post, McCallister flicks it in and it's headed away by Grimondi
[4001.12 - 4006.72] P:1556.16 E:0.052417 |  out of play, throwing the Liverpool, sometimes it just takes him two or three minutes to get into the
[4007.28 - 4011.60] P:1653.19 E:0.050826 |  into the scenario just coming on as a substitute it's not easy, McCallister's throwing,
[4011.76 - 4015.28] P:1649.17 E:0.050357 |  Schmitzer runs for and he's done well, put your room down the left and as he crossed
[4015.28 - 4020.24] P:1556.88 E:0.062945 |  Grimondi's foot, he's divided it behind for a Liverpool form at the Liverpool fans end
[4020.24 - 4024.72] P:1492.27 E:0.061158 |  that's why you can hear a lot noise yeah so McCallister a bit of a man who was going to deliver
[4024.72 - 4030.16] P:1415.28 E:0.059669 |  this as well, all right well he put his left arm forward and I've watched Liverpool so much of late
[4030.16 - 4038.72] P:1482.30 E:0.057438 |  that usually means near post for Hope to head off, left arm aloft we'll see it is to the near post
[4038.80 - 4043.68] P:1564.92 E:0.052581 |  and then go serve your heads at home and headed away by Grimondi, great head away by Grimondi because
[4044.24 - 4048.72] P:1529.10 E:0.056945 |  he was a nice flick on by Hope, oh him was running behind him but Grimondi was there,
[4048.72 - 4054.16] P:1540.86 E:0.049230 |  you watch it Jim, two arms aloft means a deeper corner but what I can never understand is if I
[4054.16 - 4060.16] P:1560.80 E:0.055856 |  can see this why can't the opposition see it all the time anyway Schmitzer comes forward for Liverpool
[4060.16 - 4065.36] P:1584.85 E:0.054936 |  and Schmitzer again runs forward and leaves the ball behind him and Luebberg takes it clear for Arsenal
[4066.08 - 4071.04] P:1539.42 E:0.050387 |  Henri's on the half way line, Luebberg moves in field and then plays it back to Mark and Kiln,
[4071.04 - 4076.96] P:1480.86 E:0.047291 |  we played 18 and a half minutes of the second half and it remains Arsenal 0 Liverpool 0 and it's a
[4076.96 - 4082.80] P:1526.54 E:0.048685 |  brighter second half, Perez to Luebberg, do you think it's because they're towering a little bit?
[4083.44 - 4087.28] P:1613.49 E:0.053420 |  Yes well you were expecting you know one or two spaces starting to appear but if you if you look at
[4087.28 - 4093.52] P:1519.30 E:0.047126 |  the game basically and we've played an hour and over then very few shots at goal, very few, well
[4093.52 - 4098.16] P:1547.69 E:0.047430 |  we've only really had the two chances, one for Arsenal for Henri which he certainly should have
[4098.16 - 4103.36] P:1467.71 E:0.043641 |  scored and then the Heskey header in the second half which seemed insane, Cole, oh sorry I'm thinking
[4103.36 - 4106.72] P:1546.90 E:0.050210 |  about Cole that was another chance that was the best chance of the match for me, of course it was,
[4106.72 - 4111.36] P:1621.77 E:0.045157 |  hopefully off the line from Ashley Cole, it's forward for Liverpool to Ohan, Ohan controls it
[4111.36 - 4117.36] P:1591.13 E:0.053592 |  well holding off Kiln, plays it back to Gerard, Gerard now to Carragher and certainly of the two
[4117.36 - 4122.56] P:1522.09 E:0.046404 |  teams Liverpool would certainly not want extra time, not with the UEFA Cup final coming up in
[4122.56 - 4125.84] P:1463.66 E:0.049365 |  the Dortmund on Wednesday night, you'll hear the whole of that in five lines, good ball forward to
[4125.84 - 4130.96] P:1570.47 E:0.051500 |  Heskey, Heskey tries to flick it to Murphy, he didn't quite come off and a rampaging one by
[4130.96 - 4136.48] P:1609.44 E:0.057712 |  Packard, the error, ready made 50th on towards Wilton, good anticipation by Best of El, I do his penalty
[4136.48 - 4142.00] P:1580.76 E:0.063126 |  area and the clearance up fail and Cole has to be careful here, careful here, oh Cole is pulled back
[4142.00 - 4146.88] P:1660.79 E:0.057492 |  by Heskey according to the linesman and it's a free kick to Arsenal, well he's letting go Steve
[4146.88 - 4151.84] P:1635.78 E:0.053661 |  Dome because they've all fell for Cole in the end but didn't look too much trouble to me, here's the
[4152.16 - 4156.16] P:1608.02 E:0.049910 |  error again, the error pushing the Liverpool penalty into the Liverpool penalty area, Best of
[4156.16 - 4160.88] P:1591.97 E:0.052653 |  El out but Wilton runs the ball behind, that's going to be a goal kick, just slightly over it,
[4160.88 - 4164.32] P:1643.03 E:0.055576 |  though all that was a much better passenger player, the booring you can hear there is
[4165.12 - 4171.52] P:1630.71 E:0.052537 |  aimed at the referee for the supposed foul Heskey on Cole, I think Cole actually lost his bearings
[4171.52 - 4175.76] P:1671.10 E:0.056427 |  there, that's what I thought, I was a bit surprised at that position anyway, what's happening here,
[4175.76 - 4181.68] P:1691.46 E:0.058735 |  he can't change his boots, I think like that, come on, well he's letting him, that's exactly what's
[4181.68 - 4186.64] P:1535.75 E:0.062960 |  happening, I don't think Mr Dunl will worry about half time, about extra time if he hasn't
[4186.64 - 4193.68] P:1594.94 E:0.061651 |  got far to go, no, no, that Liverpool would want it, and Arsenal will take it if necessary
[4194.48 - 4199.28] P:1547.14 E:0.052834 |  and Mike might get him forecast it, interesting to go, he thought it was going to be an extra time,
[4199.28 - 4204.80] P:1569.71 E:0.050634 |  he wouldn't surprise me Alan, let's see that, unless he can get Smiths into the game soon,
[4204.80 - 4208.80] P:1586.45 E:0.047333 |  I would have thought you know we could have seen Berger really, I think if he doesn't get into
[4208.80 - 4215.36] P:1609.31 E:0.046477 |  it soon, well Berger, Berger has been limbering up for as long as Gary McAllister, Berger for
[4215.36 - 4220.08] P:1654.00 E:0.045248 |  Schmitz who would be the next natural change, clearance finally by Best of All, Adams heads it
[4220.08 - 4225.12] P:1519.40 E:0.044382 |  away and Schmitz heads it back to Carragher, Carragher right footed, hits it down the Liverpool
[4225.12 - 4230.00] P:1587.76 E:0.059252 |  left touchline, all kicks and slips and very unfortunately comes off his knee out of play
[4230.00 - 4233.20] P:1602.05 E:0.056436 |  for Liverpool Throne, he just was looking around to see if there were any Liverpool players in
[4233.20 - 4240.32] P:1529.73 E:0.042602 |  the vicinity, there weren't actually, but Liverpool are throwing, Carragher to take it and Carragher
[4240.32 - 4247.84] P:1487.32 E:0.044125 |  throws it back to Gerard, Gerard to Hoopia, Hoopia into Gerard again just left of the centre circle,
[4247.84 - 4252.08] P:1621.45 E:0.049811 |  Gerard looking to hit it crossfield towards Babel, good crossfield pass to Walsh too,
[4252.08 - 4256.32] P:1640.08 E:0.044416 |  to Marcus Babel who controls it, slips it in towards Gary McAllister just ahead of the
[4256.32 - 4260.64] P:1664.11 E:0.050881 |  scot and through it goes to David Seaman, the intention was very good, it was just slightly
[4260.64 - 4265.52] P:1474.30 E:0.051966 |  over hit there but Keown was completely in control there and to be fair he hasn't missed much in
[4265.52 - 4269.76] P:1444.35 E:0.053423 |  this match Keown, just that one incident where he lost out on the header and asked he got the
[4269.76 - 4274.64] P:1494.45 E:0.053792 |  header on and Seaman saying but he was there shielding that ball away, quick control by Omri,
[4274.64 - 4278.56] P:1513.92 E:0.058417 |  Omri's left on Schubert down and then it hits Hoopia, rebound to Lumber, Liverpool
[4278.56 - 4283.20] P:1496.26 E:0.061082 |  took the goal was Hoopia off the line again, dropping to Omri in the folly, played infield,
[4283.20 - 4288.64] P:1515.05 E:0.062148 |  on Schubert, hits it away and Hoopia clears, so twice off the line for Hoopia, yes he did very well
[4289.60 - 4293.60] P:1438.01 E:0.055461 |  he really did, you could see it coming though because the goalkeeper rushing out he made it
[4293.60 - 4300.00] P:1536.32 E:0.049970 |  very difficult for Leungberg and he tried to chip it so he read it and that's Heskey upfield but
[4300.00 - 4305.36] P:1593.23 E:0.052646 |  Adam's up too much nice, he finds Cole on it goes to Vieira, Arsenal are the better team at the
[4305.36 - 4309.68] P:1553.74 E:0.058211 |  moment but they haven't scored yet, led way through the second half of the cup final, here's Mike
[4310.48 - 4315.04] P:1504.61 E:0.054169 |  and still full of energy and full of running is Patrick Vieira, he's having a storming second
[4315.28 - 4319.44] P:1438.47 E:0.058859 |  half, I agree that it is a much better second half but on the balance now Jim,
[4320.32 - 4324.08] P:1464.05 E:0.052021 |  the team playing in red today should be in front, well they're on the balance, oh yes I would say
[4324.08 - 4327.76] P:1487.20 E:0.053657 |  they've been the better team, I don't think anybody inside the ground will dispute that,
[4328.48 - 4332.08] P:1424.69 E:0.057587 |  but you better get the ball in the back of the net and you know when it's lying this, Liverpool
[4332.08 - 4339.12] P:1528.21 E:0.051614 |  are quite capable of getting the first goal, well Ancho just manages to reach and get a foot in,
[4339.12 - 4343.44] P:1474.20 E:0.045359 |  the ball is still bouncing around inside the Liverpool half over on the far side,
[4343.44 - 4347.20] P:1544.71 E:0.052496 |  Heskey's kept it in and now Murphy immediately closed down by Pires and Ashleigh Cole,
[4347.84 - 4352.48] P:1536.87 E:0.056347 |  Murphy's still scrapping away but he's lost the ball and neat little turns from Will Taard manages
[4352.48 - 4357.04] P:1492.47 E:0.057337 |  to avoid the referee, finds Pires who's sitting in the centre of midfield, Pires tried to play in
[4357.04 - 4361.36] P:1559.06 E:0.058789 |  Dixon down the right hand side, the ball was too short and now Liverpool may be dangerous on the
[4361.36 - 4366.64] P:1580.24 E:0.055255 |  counter attack, Carragher floats it forward, Smits is there, Grimondi's back, Smits has got no support
[4366.64 - 4371.60] P:1623.48 E:0.057351 |  at all at the moment, Michael Owen arise behind him, Owen on the edge of the penalty area faced by
[4371.60 - 4376.32] P:1585.47 E:0.052453 |  Vieira and Grimondi, Owen still manages to retain possession, he's got Smits with him still on
[4376.32 - 4381.12] P:1503.31 E:0.052986 |  the left hand side, McAllister's now in the penalty area but Liverpool have to hold, they don't get
[4381.12 - 4386.48] P:1536.30 E:0.053272 |  the ball into the area, they knock it across square to Danny Murphy, Murphy now back again to Michael
[4386.48 - 4390.40] P:1547.01 E:0.051604 |  Owen down this left hand side, lovely first touch from Michael Owen, Owen against Dixon in the
[4390.40 - 4394.72] P:1516.33 E:0.051049 |  penalty area, Owen cuts in and then with his right foot drives it to the far post, almost missed at
[4394.72 - 4399.84] P:1541.06 E:0.053556 |  the far post by Arsenal, Badall nearly sneaked him down that right hand side, a poor herring clearance
[4400.72 - 4405.92] P:1557.96 E:0.050544 |  Arsenal long ball played in again by Danny Murphy, Dixon drops it, lets it drop, wants it to go
[4405.92 - 4410.64] P:1566.82 E:0.055740 |  over the line, it hasn't done yet so Dixon has to play it and eventually finds touch so
[4411.68 - 4417.20] P:1537.54 E:0.055098 |  suddenly a good retaliation by Liverpool but it's still Liverpool 0 Arsenal 0, this is five live
[4417.20 - 4423.36] P:1422.63 E:0.054341 |  and BBC World Service the cup final live from the Millennium Stadium, still waiting for a first goal
[4423.36 - 4429.36] P:1475.69 E:0.051308 |  in the first cup final outside England, thrown to be taken by Jamie Carragher, the referee's not happy
[4429.84 - 4435.76] P:1456.36 E:0.051439 |  something going on in the area involving Keown and Heskey, 20 minutes to go of normal time, remember
[4435.76 - 4440.64] P:1466.84 E:0.052064 |  we had a penalty shootout in the other cup final played in the stadium, the Lee cup final which
[4440.64 - 4446.88] P:1560.01 E:0.047521 |  Liverpool 1, throw by Carragher aimed towards Heskey, up in the air it goes and Heskey has a free header
[4446.88 - 4453.36] P:1577.06 E:0.052269 |  eventually it's Pires knocking it strongly out, Gerard knocks it back in it goes, Arsenal had pushed up
[4453.36 - 4459.20] P:1600.88 E:0.050745 |  and in the end Heskey was looking interested but the ball has gone away from him and it's a goal
[4459.20 - 4463.92] P:1528.79 E:0.053206 |  kick for Seaman, the ball came out to Gerard who's now playing in the Imam role really, he's just
[4463.92 - 4468.96] P:1510.97 E:0.050708 |  playing behind the the other midfield players coming up to join whenever he can, there was an
[4468.96 - 4474.32] P:1482.36 E:0.053122 |  opportunity about 30 yards out and he miscuted I think, he miscuted that ball I think he had a
[4474.32 - 4479.28] P:1492.74 E:0.050890 |  pop-up goal but it went across and it could have gone anywhere but he didn't fall to a Liverpool player
[4480.48 - 4485.04] P:1489.43 E:0.047690 |  David Seaman's clearance and that's gone out of player on the far side, the last time that Arsenal
[4486.00 - 4492.24] P:1442.42 E:0.044494 |  played in FA Cup time Wales I was there and they lost to Rexon under George Graham of course
[4492.24 - 4498.48] P:1590.50 E:0.044260 |  and the game continues over on the far side and a good stretch by Ashleigh Cole, no sign yet that
[4499.28 - 4504.56] P:1536.12 E:0.045322 |  Arsenal Venger's going to make a change yet, Ray Parler possibly to come on soon for maybe for
[4504.56 - 4509.36] P:1571.92 E:0.049453 |  Freddie Lungberg so that might be the first Arsenal change, Liverpool have brought on McAllister
[4509.36 - 4514.40] P:1554.92 E:0.053584 |  in the second half of her man, now Martin Keown with a good, Emile Heskey's got a bang on the head
[4514.48 - 4518.16] P:1714.16 E:0.056382 |  they're having a bit of a set two at the moment those two, clearance by Seaman
[4519.12 - 4524.48] P:1575.48 E:0.048521 |  and now Arsenal bringing it out of defense with Grimond, he can't go forward back again to Keown
[4524.48 - 4529.76] P:1522.09 E:0.044251 |  who'll be hoping of course to be named in Sven Joran Ericsson's England squad for the World Cup
[4529.76 - 4534.00] P:1560.71 E:0.051621 |  game in Greece also the friendly with Mexico, Arsenal lose their way and Liverpool have had
[4534.00 - 4537.92] P:1590.67 E:0.049443 |  a better last three or four minutes, it's Jamie Carragher thought about going forward in the end
[4537.92 - 4541.84] P:1567.36 E:0.048897 |  gives it back to his keeper away to our right Sander Vestervoet, Liverpool near Arsenal 0,
[4541.84 - 4547.60] P:1611.59 E:0.047329 |  Vestervoet's ball is kept in over on the far side by Babel in the sunshine, Babel back again to
[4547.60 - 4551.12] P:1523.02 E:0.057157 |  Vestervoet and Vestervoet's clearance that could have gone anywhere that was a real Daisy
[4551.12 - 4555.28] P:1653.59 E:0.055711 |  cutter and it's back again, it's put his team under pressure, Robert Pires now for Arsenal charging
[4555.28 - 4562.24] P:1686.03 E:0.067067 |  forward, Lungberg's there, goes for the goalkeeper and scores for Arsenal and it all came about
[4563.20 - 4569.60] P:1536.13 E:0.067290 |  as a result of that very poor clearance from Sander Vestervoet, Liverpool have been punished,
[4569.60 - 4575.60] P:1556.18 E:0.065970 |  Freddie Lungberg who I thought might be about to be replaced here by Ray Parla but the man from
[4575.60 - 4580.88] P:1521.72 E:0.061757 |  Sweden with the red streak in his hair has gone round Vestervoet and he's broken the deadlock
[4580.88 - 4587.68] P:1577.88 E:0.062795 |  here in the Cup final, it's Arsenal 1 Liverpool 0, yeah so I think in the end it was one of two
[4587.68 - 4592.48] P:1562.56 E:0.062674 |  things really that brought it about but in the close it was a clearance first of all out from
[4592.48 - 4596.72] P:1554.89 E:0.063940 |  the goalkeeper but there was a nice feed back in and I must give Lungberg credit there,
[4597.28 - 4601.44] P:1580.20 E:0.061450 |  he showed a bit of pace and when it came on he whipped it out to the left hand side and I
[4601.44 - 4605.84] P:1590.09 E:0.061191 |  thought it just for a second gone too far but he's banged it into the back of the net,
[4605.84 - 4611.76] P:1551.95 E:0.062735 |  good goal by Lungberg and I think Arsenal you know on the balance of play really, I've shared it definitely
[4614.48 - 4620.48] P:1522.69 E:0.059790 |  Liverpool have 17 and a half minutes to respond here, Arsenal go in front,
[4621.60 - 4626.24] P:1513.15 E:0.060601 |  1-0 they lead, Freddie Lungberg and they had been the likely scorers but now Arsenal have to
[4626.24 - 4630.80] P:1472.81 E:0.055411 |  concentrate and Adams will do that and gets in against Michael Owen and now Gerard Houdier
[4630.80 - 4634.80] P:1489.71 E:0.060968 |  might be wondering whether to make another change, maybe sooner or later Robbie Fowler
[4635.36 - 4640.80] P:1577.72 E:0.061408 |  but the word was that Parla could well be coming on and I thought that Lungberg
[4640.80 - 4645.60] P:1441.90 E:0.058771 |  was the most likely person to come off but he's now scored, the man from Sweden who normally
[4645.60 - 4649.60] P:1442.35 E:0.057518 |  does well of course playing for Sweden against England, it's 1-0 to Arsenal, ball played in by
[4649.60 - 4654.64] P:1617.56 E:0.058555 |  Gerard headed away by Keown and of course now Liverpool have to penetrate this excellent
[4654.72 - 4658.40] P:1598.76 E:0.057261 |  Arsenal defence, long one now from Lungberg looking for Will Taard over on the far side
[4659.04 - 4664.72] P:1591.73 E:0.061921 |  and on show clears into the crowd over on the far side, 20-year old game football, you know
[4664.72 - 4671.84] P:1566.52 E:0.053665 |  Parla was that you know he was all ready to come on and Lungberg has got the goal, Parla still stood
[4671.84 - 4675.84] P:1587.01 E:0.058552 |  there wondering whether there's opportunity, well he's going to come or whether he's gone,
[4675.84 - 4679.60] P:1546.83 E:0.059444 |  just talking to Steve Stiefold here just before I picked up the commentary he thought that the
[4679.60 - 4685.04] P:1540.59 E:0.059696 |  first change would be Parla for Lungberg and they appear to be about to make that change when
[4685.60 - 4689.04] P:1532.20 E:0.059390 |  Lungberg scored, took it well, went round the goalkeeper and the way that Henri should have
[4689.04 - 4692.72] P:1534.30 E:0.056028 |  done in the first half, now Smitzer though for Liverpool, ever dangerous, the ball played into
[4692.72 - 4697.84] P:1581.05 E:0.060162 |  Waltheski but they'll have to do better than that, Adams gets in and releases Lungberg now down the
[4697.84 - 4702.16] P:1628.96 E:0.060882 |  right hand side that's a glorious fall into Henri with only one defender back, Henri goes through
[4702.16 - 4706.96] P:1620.32 E:0.060613 |  could score, great save for Vestermelt, Henri again complete miss kick and it'll be clear off the
[4706.96 - 4711.68] P:1606.58 E:0.060663 |  line by up here and Henri should have scored second time round, initially a great save from
[4711.68 - 4716.08] P:1559.58 E:0.056948 |  Vestermelt, wonderful ball by Lungberg, when it came back to Henri it should have been too
[4716.08 - 4722.96] P:1495.90 E:0.060711 |  no, what a chance that was really, but the game's opened up now, but really that could have finished
[4722.96 - 4727.04] P:1442.52 E:0.059508 |  it really, the describe of Dominique has been Liverpool are coming forward with Babel down
[4727.04 - 4732.80] P:1471.45 E:0.051110 |  the right hand side, that really could and should have been the second and that should have been
[4733.44 - 4738.16] P:1443.99 E:0.056218 |  you would have thought with 16 minutes to go enough to win the cup, but it's 1-0 to Arsenal,
[4738.16 - 4742.56] P:1418.36 E:0.059125 |  1-0 to the Arsenal, how many times do we hear that over the years? I wouldn't have thought that
[4742.56 - 4746.56] P:1446.63 E:0.059763 |  whoofie had kicked the ball off Liverpool's line three times in one match would he? Gary McAllister
[4746.56 - 4752.88] P:1530.26 E:0.058230 |  now down the centre looking for Danny Murphy who made the run and Murphy's fallen awkwardly with
[4753.76 - 4759.36] P:1578.50 E:0.056437 |  Martin Keown inside the penalty area, Murphy's on his back, Keown is on his back as well and on for
[4759.36 - 4763.44] P:1518.95 E:0.056204 |  the first time really in the game come the two physios and it's a chance for you Jen just to
[4764.72 - 4770.24] P:1485.23 E:0.063076 |  the situation. Well I mean say Henri there what he did, he actually went round Vestermelt,
[4770.24 - 4775.52] P:1530.71 E:0.061363 |  the most lovely ball through from Lungberg, but when it came back to him the second time it looked
[4775.52 - 4780.56] P:1541.13 E:0.063576 |  to me as though he miscued it, he miscued the ball and really should have stuck it in the back
[4780.56 - 4784.80] P:1519.44 E:0.060988 |  of the net, it was a wonderful chance, it was a better chance than the one that Colad before
[4784.80 - 4788.96] P:1449.99 E:0.061937 |  that was played off the line and hope he was there again just to pick the ball up and the same Mike
[4789.36 - 4796.56] P:1519.03 E:0.061753 |  three times now whoofie off Liverpool's line. Well while the treatment is still being given to the
[4796.56 - 4800.80] P:1515.86 E:0.056997 |  injured players we are going to get a change from Arsenal over on the far side and looks like
[4800.80 - 4809.04] P:1667.93 E:0.057494 |  Will Tord is going off now, Sylvan Will Tord having just gone in front, Ray Parler is coming on and
[4809.04 - 4813.68] P:1600.43 E:0.052948 |  I'm not sure whether that would have been the initial plan but maybe Arsenal now having gone
[4813.68 - 4818.40] P:1604.49 E:0.049120 |  in front Jim are thinking of really closing it down now. Well they've looked pretty close you
[4818.64 - 4825.04] P:1533.58 E:0.055728 |  know the back to me as it is you know they're not giving much away and he's done well Will Tord I
[4825.04 - 4829.36] P:1523.59 E:0.056965 |  think he's a busy little lad he's put himself around a bit he's tried to give support whatever
[4829.36 - 4834.08] P:1558.38 E:0.063670 |  possible you know I think he's done very well he's worked hard so there's a pair of fresh legs as
[4834.08 - 4838.96] P:1544.73 E:0.062297 |  much as anything, Parler's come out to the right Lungberg now will go further up you know he'll get
[4838.96 - 4843.28] P:1555.06 E:0.060335 |  a free reign round to run around and I don't think he's going to take Grimondi off I thought he might
[4843.52 - 4848.24] P:1585.72 E:0.057506 |  have been impossible he's done well well Pat he's done a good job, Berger and Fowler are both
[4848.24 - 4853.36] P:1679.52 E:0.058653 |  going to come on for Liverpool so it could still be Robbie Fowler's day Patrick Berger is coming on
[4853.36 - 4859.84] P:1715.44 E:0.057874 |  Danny Murphy's gone off we also think that Kahnu might come on soon for Arsenal as well
[4860.40 - 4868.72] P:1596.46 E:0.054950 |  because he's been called as well by Arson Wenger so Patrick Berger is coming on for Murphy
[4869.28 - 4873.52] P:1560.71 E:0.048074 |  and who is Fowler coming on for we're just waiting to see Robbie Fowler
[4875.04 - 4879.44] P:1446.39 E:0.060732 |  the Liverpool captain will come on for Vladimir Smith sir so that's
[4880.48 - 4884.56] P:1744.47 E:0.061843 |  they are the last changes of course that Gerard Hullier can make, McAllister, Fowler
[4884.56 - 4890.08] P:1760.99 E:0.056079 |  and Berger great response great reaction now from the crowd as Robbie Fowler who of course scored a
[4890.08 - 4894.72] P:1632.01 E:0.056240 |  fantastic goal here in the Worthington Cup final he comes on and so Liverpool really going for it
[4894.72 - 4899.20] P:1649.29 E:0.056774 |  now with Heskey Fowler and Owen Heskey's gone out to the right side now Berger on the left
[4900.40 - 4905.92] P:1516.33 E:0.054748 |  and Fowler will be up front alongside Owen so we'll see when other things can get much more
[4905.92 - 4910.80] P:1660.92 E:0.055946 |  support to the front players because so far they've had very very little really to trouble I think
[4910.80 - 4915.20] P:1687.15 E:0.051458 |  anyway or they could have troubled them but I think strength due to Arson's strength at the back
[4915.76 - 4923.28] P:1618.68 E:0.050382 |  Adams Keown very very strong indeed well Thierry Henry could have put this game beyond Liverpool
[4923.28 - 4927.68] P:1447.66 E:0.056240 |  here is Mr. Couple of great chances Freddie Lungberg though has scored the goal and it's
[4927.68 - 4932.16] P:1472.65 E:0.056837 |  Arsenal won Liverpool 0 Liverpool have had the upper hand in all the domestic games
[4932.16 - 4936.64] P:1516.35 E:0.056309 |  in the last five years but when it comes to the big one Arsenal again have risen to the occasion
[4936.64 - 4941.92] P:1419.44 E:0.055267 |  long one now from Martin Keown and honoree is given offside and that's a free kick to Liverpool so
[4941.92 - 4948.56] P:1407.91 E:0.059398 |  here in Cardiff the red dragons today are Arsenal so far they're wearing the red and they lead by
[4948.64 - 4952.56] P:1496.45 E:0.058903 |  one goal to nil and overall they deserve to have that lead and Freddie Lungberg now is fouled
[4952.56 - 4958.24] P:1573.15 E:0.049425 |  by Gerard on the halfway line. Thierry is shaped to take the kick quickly but nobody really ready
[4958.24 - 4962.16] P:1499.12 E:0.052207 |  for it and now Arsenal clearly will try and use up a little bit of time as well they've got a free
[4962.16 - 4967.12] P:1665.15 E:0.057810 |  kick. You know a song this award is singing Arsenal one nil to the Arsenal they had a gang of them
[4967.12 - 4972.24] P:1514.12 E:0.062890 |  singing that when I was coming in. And remember this is the only trophy that Arsenal can win this
[4972.24 - 4977.52] P:1528.01 E:0.053980 |  season unlike Liverpool still going to be way for cup on Wednesday this is five live and BBC World
[4977.52 - 4984.08] P:1665.59 E:0.057040 |  Service live from Cardiff we've got 12 minutes to go in the cup final and Arsenal have gone in front
[4984.08 - 4989.68] P:1624.30 E:0.052645 |  here through Freddie Lungberg initially a mistake by Vestervoet very poor clearance by the goalkeeper
[4989.68 - 4993.92] P:1581.62 E:0.056748 |  and Liverpool never really came to terms with it and eventually excellent little ball through to
[4993.92 - 4997.92] P:1493.45 E:0.053058 |  Lungberg who went round Vestervoet and finished well. honoree since then has missed a great chance
[4997.92 - 5004.00] P:1540.31 E:0.051112 |  to make it 2-0. Ball is inside the centre circle. Hopia. Hopia now to Babel. Babel's though veering
[5004.00 - 5008.72] P:1613.14 E:0.049892 |  back towards his own goalkeeper gives it back again to Hopia. Liverpool have just brought on
[5008.72 - 5013.68] P:1668.92 E:0.050417 |  Fowler and Berger. Ball now is flicked on by Michael Owen but Keown is there Keown and Adams
[5013.68 - 5017.92] P:1591.51 E:0.048556 |  haven't really missed a great deal at the back issues. Water day for Arsenal. Arsenal's ball
[5017.92 - 5022.40] P:1603.48 E:0.051069 |  straight back again though to the men in the goal of Liverpool. Gary McAllister short of the halfway
[5022.40 - 5027.92] P:1667.57 E:0.049027 |  line plays the ball through honoree's legs finds on show and now on to Stephen Geron nothing like
[5027.92 - 5033.36] P:1598.82 E:0.053332 |  as effective in the last half an hour or so in this final Stephen Geron. Vestervoet now running the
[5033.36 - 5039.28] P:1625.59 E:0.050317 |  ball out of the penalty area. Vestervoet clears long down the far side. Heskey will jump with
[5039.28 - 5044.08] P:1710.40 E:0.051225 |  Ashley Colombriss will easily win the ball but great challenge by Keown on Michael Owen and now
[5044.08 - 5049.84] P:1656.82 E:0.050775 |  Vieira. Vieira faced by McAllister. Ball into Perez and Perez has completely lost that and it's a
[5049.84 - 5053.60] P:1577.49 E:0.058123 |  throat in Liverpool over on the far side he just seemed to take his eye off it. No I let it go through
[5053.60 - 5056.88] P:1607.46 E:0.052087 |  his legs I think you thought there was another player coming behind him. Babel back to the
[5056.88 - 5062.72] P:1584.22 E:0.047303 |  halfway line to find Ancho. Ancho will just knock it across the centre of his defence and find
[5062.80 - 5067.44] P:1434.05 E:0.051597 |  Pupier who's now been relieved to the captaincy now that Fowler's come on. Fowler inside the centre
[5067.44 - 5071.84] P:1602.58 E:0.055415 |  circle back again to Geron down the centre from Geron. Owen away from the defender. Owen in the
[5071.84 - 5077.84] P:1716.20 E:0.059603 |  area cross comes Keown and the big defender Keown did so well there. Closing down Michael Owen before
[5077.84 - 5082.00] P:1674.28 E:0.061633 |  he could untangle his legs and get a shotting goal and now Ray Parler going forward for the first
[5082.00 - 5088.40] P:1646.89 E:0.053644 |  time but can't get it through to Arnary and tidying up his Ancho and Liverpool almost cut through.
[5088.56 - 5093.84] P:1721.44 E:0.054232 |  There's a great challenge. Terrific challenge really because Owen was inside the penalty spot
[5093.84 - 5099.36] P:1649.77 E:0.060858 |  there going at goal and Keown was quite a pacey player. You know he did very well because he
[5099.36 - 5105.28] P:1650.66 E:0.053040 |  got his body in there won the ball you know and he pushed Owen away with it at the same time.
[5105.28 - 5111.04] P:1664.33 E:0.050723 |  Terrific challenge that was. The last 10 minutes of the Cup final Arsenal won Liverpool 0. Freddy
[5111.04 - 5116.40] P:1666.69 E:0.053191 |  Lungberg has scored. Gary McAllister now wasted. Income Arsenal with a need interception. Martin
[5116.40 - 5121.12] P:1626.93 E:0.050712 |  Keown has just saved the day. Keown checks and then hits it down the centre. There's only
[5121.12 - 5125.52] P:1703.50 E:0.055229 |  Anri downfield now. Wiltor's been taken off. Anri with a good little ball to Lungberg. He's
[5125.52 - 5129.84] P:1638.78 E:0.057287 |  got Parler on the outside and Lungberg goes for glory and hits it 10 yards wide into the Arsenal
[5129.84 - 5134.48] P:1643.51 E:0.055785 |  fans behind Vestival's goal. The goal's gone to his head a little bit and I think that was a bit
[5134.48 - 5140.48] P:1664.65 E:0.052711 |  adventurous there but because he had Parler coming up on the right hand side but he's already found
[5140.48 - 5144.88] P:1607.41 E:0.052247 |  the back of the net. He's after another one. It was Miles off target there but so that challenge
[5144.88 - 5150.24] P:1631.04 E:0.049639 |  of Keown's I'm just going to say as well. I don't think Owen's first touch really you know did
[5150.24 - 5155.84] P:1674.24 E:0.052566 |  him any favours and Keown did well. Just got a ball away. Well we told you before the game
[5155.84 - 5160.64] P:1673.15 E:0.051733 |  that Arsenal normally win the FA Cup the year after Chelsea and at the moment they're on course to do
[5160.64 - 5164.96] P:1628.09 E:0.057672 |  that again. They lead here by one goal to know but still a lot of work to do. Still eight minutes
[5164.96 - 5168.88] P:1548.13 E:0.051010 |  for Liverpool to get back in the game. Anything could happen yet. Ball down this near side.
[5168.88 - 5174.08] P:1616.19 E:0.053706 |  Jamie Kerrigan and he's well advanced inside the Arsenal half. Parler is holding him up and he's
[5174.08 - 5178.64] P:1711.38 E:0.061055 |  holding him up illegally. It's a free kick to Liverpool. Gary McAllister time. Once more down
[5178.64 - 5184.08] P:1680.72 E:0.049413 |  this left hand side. McAllister to make the free kick. Hopier obviously to go forward. Heskey
[5184.08 - 5190.56] P:1643.36 E:0.049117 |  will be dangerous and McAllister gets the ball and it's about five yards in from the near touch
[5190.56 - 5194.40] P:1519.15 E:0.051617 |  line down this near side. This is the right hand side, the left hand side, the field.
[5194.40 - 5199.04] P:1601.86 E:0.052302 |  Babble's in the penalty area too and it goes and it's headed up in the air by Martin Keown.
[5199.04 - 5204.48] P:1730.98 E:0.065342 |  It's still only six yards out. Babble's there and McAllister is there and it goes from Michael
[5204.48 - 5211.28] P:1637.31 E:0.066348 |  Aime. Seven yards out and brilliant finish by the England striker. Sustaining his marvellous run
[5211.28 - 5218.56] P:1620.65 E:0.066289 |  just recently. Three goals against Newcastle, two against Chelsea and in his very first cup final
[5218.56 - 5223.44] P:1630.35 E:0.066846 |  he's made it here. Arsenal won Liverpool won a brilliant, typical finish from Michael Aime.
[5224.48 - 5228.32] P:1625.32 E:0.066075 |  Well it's amazing how it goes. It's probably the only way that Liverpool's looked at all
[5228.32 - 5233.12] P:1677.27 E:0.066104 |  the good of score to me is off a dead ball situation. The ball was knocked in. Keown headed
[5233.12 - 5237.84] P:1571.52 E:0.066203 |  it up in the air and he went up in the air. I think it was Babble who got the next touch
[5238.48 - 5244.00] P:1666.31 E:0.067842 |  and he knocked it down and Aime was the player who reacted first. Give him credit, put the ball
[5244.00 - 5250.96] P:1714.04 E:0.061803 |  in the back of the net. Well Karnu is going to come on soon for Arsenal. I said anything could
[5250.96 - 5254.88] P:1655.07 E:0.059382 |  happen yet in this game. Another Gary McAllister free kickers down the trick and now Arsenal have
[5254.88 - 5259.60] P:1681.32 E:0.060356 |  to clear and they haven't cleared it too well. Burger is there. It's it's straight up Martin Keown
[5259.60 - 5263.28] P:1736.95 E:0.065466 |  and Liverpool win a corner and the whole atmosphere in the Millennium Stadium now has
[5263.28 - 5268.88] P:1670.72 E:0.058752 |  transformed. One-one and we've got six and a half minutes to go. It's going to be a Gary McAllister
[5269.68 - 5274.00] P:1554.46 E:0.061552 |  corner kick down this near side. Alan was saying that one hand normally means near post,
[5274.00 - 5278.56] P:1553.69 E:0.062717 |  two hands normally means far post and at the moment it's the one arm that's been raised
[5278.56 - 5283.68] P:1667.26 E:0.063491 |  and Babble is there once more. All sorts of problems and it's one arm. This presumably will go
[5283.68 - 5288.96] P:1616.04 E:0.060185 |  towards Huppier at the near post. David Seaman raises both arms and it goes towards the near
[5288.96 - 5293.84] P:1689.91 E:0.058112 |  post. It's more into the centre of the goal this time. Keown clears, Burger pounces, excellent ball
[5293.84 - 5299.12] P:1716.01 E:0.059133 |  back to McAllister who hit it instinctively across the six yard area. Hit it too strongly though
[5299.12 - 5305.36] P:1683.23 E:0.063688 |  and it's going to be a goal kick to be taken by David Seaman. Well what a situation. Johnston
[5305.36 - 5311.52] P:1611.19 E:0.060318 |  two, Dundee United three now in Scotland and we wait now for Karnu to come on for Arsenal
[5311.60 - 5316.48] P:1689.67 E:0.061671 |  and Freddie Lungberg having scored the goal. I have to say I think he was coming off originally
[5317.04 - 5322.08] P:1618.08 E:0.065146 |  and then he scored and Ray Parler then came on for Wilton as Arsenal and Banger looked to try and
[5323.36 - 5328.88] P:1618.24 E:0.063808 |  really make things solid out there but now Arsenal need another goal of course and Karnu has come
[5328.88 - 5335.04] P:1633.66 E:0.063397 |  on to Lungberg. There's a difference of goal may say. Some of them was a spring in Liverpool's step.
[5335.92 - 5339.84] P:1716.51 E:0.061677 |  Public ball from Burger out to McAllister just a moment ago and he whipped it across
[5339.84 - 5344.72] P:1719.16 E:0.058433 |  naturally. Well anything can happen now Mike. Well it's all happened in this game in the last 10,
[5344.72 - 5349.20] P:1683.96 E:0.056163 |  15 minutes and now Pyrrhus down the left hand side and my word what will Thierry Henry be thinking
[5349.20 - 5354.88] P:1675.98 E:0.055975 |  now he's missed a couple of really great chances here for Arsenal today. It's now Arsenal won Liverpool
[5354.88 - 5359.92] P:1716.80 E:0.055934 |  won on five live and BBC World Service in the cup final. Karnu gets his first touch for those
[5359.92 - 5364.40] P:1715.13 E:0.061309 |  long legs Karnu but McAllister's too sharp for him and McAllister's going to win the ball against
[5364.40 - 5369.68] P:1776.75 E:0.063252 |  Karnu. Great play by the Scott. McAllister on to Robbie Fowler. Fowler's moving he's got owing
[5369.68 - 5374.32] P:1780.68 E:0.056570 |  down the left hand side but he was a little selfish actually ran forward with the ball
[5374.32 - 5379.36] P:1791.18 E:0.054043 |  inevitably lost it and as the game opens up once more the Ayrus switches it down the left hand side
[5379.36 - 5383.60] P:1721.49 E:0.055788 |  a fantastic ball. Henry took it on the chest he's going to run up Marcos Babel. Henry's all on
[5383.60 - 5387.76] P:1749.27 E:0.060942 |  his own in the penalty area and all he could do there was to shoot and Vestervelt made the save
[5387.76 - 5392.48] P:1686.91 E:0.057373 |  from the angle. This time a better distribution from Vestervelt. Ingo the challenges once more
[5393.04 - 5398.08] P:1735.81 E:0.055384 |  much much better second half the goals of course always change games it's one one and it's now
[5398.08 - 5403.44] P:1689.85 E:0.055752 |  Jamie Carragher edge of the penalty area giving it back to Sammy Huppier. Hardly time to draw breath
[5403.44 - 5409.04] P:1737.22 E:0.060475 |  here. Arsenal now being examined by Liverpool. Berger on to Fowler. Fowler's got owing again on his left
[5409.04 - 5414.08] P:1735.38 E:0.058646 |  hand side goes past Adams cross comes Ashley Cole and Cole just manages to get enough on the ball
[5414.08 - 5418.72] P:1690.14 E:0.056323 |  back to David Siemens. Siemens quick clearance downfield. Henry was offside but the referee
[5418.72 - 5424.48] P:1685.17 E:0.063745 |  Stephen Dunl will let the game carry on and the atmosphere responding now to the goals which
[5424.48 - 5429.84] P:1603.73 E:0.059056 |  have been scored belatedly in this final it was a very poor first half very unadventurous but it's
[5429.84 - 5435.44] P:1522.74 E:0.059515 |  quite exciting now one one Heskey over on that right hand side Heskey back to his defenders
[5435.44 - 5439.84] P:1570.92 E:0.056458 |  Stephen Gerrard who's playing just in front of the back four at the moment finds Sammy Huppier
[5439.84 - 5444.24] P:1637.99 E:0.055322 |  on the left of the Liverpool defence and now Carragher short of the half-way line only three
[5444.24 - 5447.92] P:1591.11 E:0.056360 |  and a half minutes to go plus whatever time will be added on at least a couple of minutes will be
[5447.92 - 5452.32] P:1570.12 E:0.062736 |  added on because we have had stoppages in this second half Liverpool just having a little bit
[5452.32 - 5457.68] P:1663.35 E:0.067686 |  of a breather here the support though coming in now from the Liverpool fans all around us
[5457.68 - 5461.28] P:1636.24 E:0.063833 |  particularly and especially away to the left where Liverpool have scored their equaliser
[5461.28 - 5466.32] P:1681.63 E:0.060206 |  through Michael Owen it's now Heskey down the right hand side halfway inside the Arsenal half
[5466.32 - 5472.72] P:1753.39 E:0.056980 |  McAllister on towards Berger Berger tried to release Marcus Babel but it was too top heavy
[5472.72 - 5477.04] P:1784.59 E:0.058799 |  and it's a goal kick well I think for the first time now I suppose perhaps from the
[5477.04 - 5481.68] P:1580.93 E:0.062636 |  early part of the game the Liverpool fans think they come in the cup here because you know they
[5481.68 - 5486.16] P:1589.24 E:0.064073 |  were out to it for a large section of the game and really Arsenal should have put it out inside but
[5486.16 - 5491.28] P:1633.66 E:0.066472 |  they haven't done that Liverpool have got back in good goal by Owen I thought it was too I just
[5491.28 - 5495.92] P:1710.96 E:0.066067 |  wonder what really Arsenal Venger's thinking about his substitution with Wiltrow coming off from
[5495.92 - 5500.08] P:1684.18 E:0.067288 |  Farleague going down you know when they were winning surprising really are we all seeing
[5500.08 - 5505.76] P:1629.55 E:0.059837 |  the game differently well Arsenal Venger has still got one more trick up his sleeve if he wants to he
[5505.76 - 5510.32] P:1712.38 E:0.051123 |  can still make another change he's still got Dennis Burkamp of course on the bench or he's still
[5510.32 - 5514.72] P:1703.73 E:0.051874 |  got Lauren as well and we're just seeing arson Venger actually coming into that technical area
[5514.72 - 5519.44] P:1733.14 E:0.051393 |  over on the far side but we've got two and a half minutes to go Arsenal won Liverpool won in the
[5519.44 - 5524.24] P:1763.28 E:0.054057 |  cup final and Arsenal have a free kick just inside the Liverpool half to the left as we look at it
[5524.24 - 5529.68] P:1752.79 E:0.051617 |  over on the far side Robert Pires takes it with his right foot towards Canu well cleared by Emil
[5529.68 - 5534.24] P:1731.74 E:0.059682 |  Heskey and now Berger with the long hair scoops the clearance forward looks for the pace of Owen
[5534.24 - 5539.68] P:1773.03 E:0.066218 |  Dixon's out of position Owen goes into the area angles all good what a goal from Michael Owen
[5540.48 - 5546.72] P:1748.05 E:0.067023 |  Michael Owen takes out Dixon Adams and Seaman and celebrates in front of the Liverpool fans
[5547.28 - 5554.56] P:1728.57 E:0.067552 |  Michael Owen is hot he's had a remarkable last week that is a great goal by any stretch of the
[5554.56 - 5560.88] P:1659.40 E:0.066363 |  imagination Liverpool were defending Berger's long ball he looked to Owen to provide the pace the
[5560.88 - 5567.76] P:1672.94 E:0.063795 |  penetration and he was there when it mattered and Liverpool have come from behind here stupendously
[5567.76 - 5573.44] P:1730.33 E:0.065900 |  through Michael Owen to lead by two goals to one well I've got to say that Liverpool probably think
[5573.44 - 5580.08] P:1774.15 E:0.061116 |  they could win the cup but really it was a fantastic fantastic finish by Owen I think
[5580.08 - 5585.36] P:1742.49 E:0.060875 |  Seaman should have covered his angle better but the ball came over from Berger was a good ball
[5585.36 - 5591.60] P:1769.41 E:0.057551 |  and what happened was it was Owen's pace that got him past Dixon and he finished it beautifully
[5591.60 - 5599.04] P:1744.76 E:0.055162 |  we were right behind it it just crept inside the post just inside the left hand post and I just say
[5599.04 - 5603.76] P:1778.30 E:0.060805 |  I was just saying you know Mike Liverpool probably the first time I actually feel they can win the
[5603.76 - 5609.76] P:1762.98 E:0.059940 |  cup with that goal it's amazing that first goal has changed everything and I think Arsenal have lost
[5609.76 - 5614.00] P:1717.80 E:0.058950 |  a little bit since they changed the formation it was a finish of the highest quality and we're in
[5614.00 - 5620.80] P:1712.12 E:0.060782 |  the last minute of normal time Michael Owen who really has come again in the last week or so
[5622.16 - 5628.08] P:1759.54 E:0.063093 |  and now I think Dennis Burkamp's gonna come on over on the far side but Owen has scored
[5628.72 - 5633.92] P:1744.56 E:0.064180 |  he's now scored 23 this season and Sven Joran Erickson who's in the stadium
[5635.36 - 5641.04] P:1676.71 E:0.063745 |  would have been so so delighted to see that from one of his main men in the side great finish
[5641.04 - 5645.12] P:1696.68 E:0.062639 |  from the angle from Michael Owen it all came about initially after Pirras had taken a free kick
[5645.12 - 5650.88] P:1735.20 E:0.061677 |  for Arsenal Liverpool were backpedalling they got it clear and then look to the pace of Michael Owen
[5650.88 - 5657.36] P:1697.94 E:0.059817 |  Dennis Burkamp now is going to come on for Lee Dixon and we have 10 seconds of normal time to go
[5657.36 - 5662.40] P:1712.06 E:0.059321 |  and the game has been turned on its head here in his very first cup final by Michael Owen
[5662.40 - 5667.36] P:1729.08 E:0.058571 |  Michael Owen who was left out of the Worthington Cup final line up here against Birmingham City
[5667.36 - 5674.64] P:1769.08 E:0.060238 |  and what will we be telling you before the game about so names winning these games who could
[5674.64 - 5679.28] P:1848.34 E:0.057169 |  so easily be Christian names of course well Owen was one of them and Owen has scored the two goals
[5679.28 - 5683.60] P:1737.94 E:0.062071 |  that look like they're gonna count unless Arsenal can come back header comes in from Martin Keough
[5683.60 - 5690.16] P:1771.34 E:0.060876 |  but Vestervoet was there and his mistake now which led to the first Arsenal goal three minutes of
[5690.16 - 5694.56] P:1759.64 E:0.054812 |  added time doesn't look like it's going to be costly but what about those misses from Thierry
[5694.56 - 5698.96] P:1696.12 E:0.058464 |  Henri now two really good chances that he squandered which could have made all the difference
[5699.68 - 5705.36] P:1664.32 E:0.063761 |  yes it's it's amazing you know our football quite often can repeat itself Michael over a period of
[5705.36 - 5710.48] P:1570.37 E:0.064716 |  time I've seen games like this many a time Arsenal look through about it one even but one meal
[5710.48 - 5714.40] P:1663.36 E:0.063173 |  anything could happen and Liverpool got the cells back in the game and then suddenly
[5714.40 - 5720.40] P:1663.06 E:0.067241 |  they get on the upswing and here they are now a couple of minutes off lifting the FA cup three
[5720.40 - 5725.92] P:1601.14 E:0.056227 |  minutes of added time two French managers we're playing this cup final outside England but the
[5725.92 - 5731.04] P:1730.12 E:0.058930 |  goals the crucial goals have been scored by an Englishman Michael Owen Liverpool lead to one
[5731.04 - 5736.16] P:1765.27 E:0.058336 |  Arsenal have to do it quickly Burkamp is there and Gerald Clare's two minutes to go two minutes
[5736.16 - 5741.04] P:1761.22 E:0.054820 |  of added time Liverpool's clearance goes straight to Ashley Cole incomes across from Cole Adams has
[5741.04 - 5746.48] P:1811.57 E:0.052415 |  stayed forward Burkamp on the edge of his area a little too slow to react incomes Grimondi Pires
[5746.56 - 5751.52] P:1806.01 E:0.055012 |  to pick up the loose ball Pires ball in will be headed away by Stefan Ancho just under two minutes
[5751.52 - 5755.60] P:1791.25 E:0.061744 |  to go about it time Liverpool have turned it round Michael Owens turned it round and now
[5755.60 - 5759.60] P:1818.21 E:0.060690 |  Arsenal are terribly caught and Fowler can get through to O'Hara it could be a hat trick but
[5759.60 - 5764.32] P:1787.45 E:0.058611 |  Fowler can't get past Martin Keown otherwise Michael Owen could have been through for the first
[5764.32 - 5770.16] P:1804.91 E:0.053117 |  hat trick in the cup final since Stanley Mortensen and Arsenal Clare but they have to do this very
[5770.16 - 5775.20] P:1828.13 E:0.059741 |  very quickly it's all gone wrong for them in goes the ball from Ray Parler and it's going to miss out
[5775.20 - 5780.88] P:1852.91 E:0.060871 |  Tarnu great roar from the Liverpool fans all around us and they are now just seconds away
[5780.88 - 5786.32] P:1809.97 E:0.057755 |  from their first FA Cup triumph for what will be nine years well it could have been a third goal
[5786.32 - 5791.52] P:1739.12 E:0.060147 |  for Liverpool there Arsenal had committed themselves forward and really foul the lost control of the
[5791.52 - 5797.28] P:1749.35 E:0.062464 |  ball it didn't look a very difficult ball to control and knock on to Michael Owen but he tried
[5797.28 - 5802.40] P:1776.84 E:0.062312 |  to get his left foot on it coming from the right and lost control all the qualities that Owen showed
[5802.40 - 5807.04] P:1735.21 E:0.058614 |  of course in the World Cup and the Glen Hoddle that great goal in San Hedyen against Argentina
[5807.04 - 5810.88] P:1766.65 E:0.059194 |  all those qualities again shown when he scored that second goal it didn't look to be on in fact
[5810.88 - 5815.28] P:1895.60 E:0.057386 |  it wouldn't have been on for most strikers in the game but Owen went through down this left hand
[5815.28 - 5820.48] P:1986.12 E:0.058070 |  side taking out Dixon and Adams and from the angle finished past David Seaman we've got seconds to
[5820.48 - 5825.60] P:1817.53 E:0.060948 |  go here in the Millennium Stadium Michael Owen is the Millennium man Liverpool lead by two goals to
[5825.60 - 5830.72] P:1737.00 E:0.059487 |  one and Arsenal are caught out and this time Fowler can't find Owen Fowler shoots weakly straight
[5830.80 - 5836.40] P:1691.25 E:0.062001 |  at David Seaman easy save that could have been the end of it and it looked off side to me and
[5836.40 - 5841.44] P:1848.75 E:0.063227 |  Arsenal committing suddenly players forward were completely caught out the whistle goes the game
[5841.44 - 5847.36] P:1693.63 E:0.066612 |  has been won by Liverpool Michael Owen punches the air all the cameramen make their way towards him
[5847.36 - 5852.56] P:1736.67 E:0.064017 |  Patrick Berger gives the little man a great big hug and Liverpool have won the cup they've come back
[5852.56 - 5857.60] P:1736.33 E:0.063484 |  from the dead here to win by two goals to one Michael Owen the hero and everybody's running
[5857.60 - 5862.48] P:1725.59 E:0.062567 |  towards him to show him and tell him exactly what they think of him great finishing by great
[5862.48 - 5867.12] P:1817.11 E:0.060583 |  striker Liverpool have now won two cup finals they will go on to Dortmund to try and complete the
[5867.12 - 5873.92] P:1764.57 E:0.061999 |  hat trick on Wednesday night it was amazing football it can be very cruel at times and it can be
[5873.92 - 5878.80] P:1778.53 E:0.063465 |  very uplifting when you win it it's been a very cruel cup final for Arsenal who really must have
[5878.80 - 5884.24] P:1749.49 E:0.059529 |  thought they had this this this cup one with about eight or nine minutes left but they've had two
[5884.24 - 5890.00] P:1742.81 E:0.064212 |  goals hit against them one of them a very good goal I thought but you know and Liverpool in the
[5890.00 - 5894.56] P:1746.39 E:0.061539 |  end have stuck on and stuck on and got it through but really Liverpool have the chances to have won
[5894.56 - 5902.16] P:1721.37 E:0.062052 |  it before that oins cup final Michael Owen two goals again you can't take that fact away from him
[5902.16 - 5908.80] P:1710.66 E:0.064902 |  wonderful but don't forget who p.a three clearances off his own line how many players have been letting
[5908.80 - 5914.00] P:1682.88 E:0.062628 |  a cup final well the last time that these two clubs met in a cup final that was at Wembley
[5914.00 - 5919.04] P:1647.08 E:0.062149 |  in the league cup when Arsenal came from behind with two goals from Charlie Nicholas to beat Liverpool
[5919.04 - 5925.04] P:1683.70 E:0.060959 |  by two goals to one the boot was very much on the other foot here today and Liverpool had to change
[5925.04 - 5929.36] P:1602.62 E:0.061290 |  their strip of course they were trying to become the first team to win the cup playing in their
[5929.36 - 5934.88] P:1600.81 E:0.060558 |  second strip since Tottenham back in 1982 they've done that but more importantly they shown great
[5934.88 - 5939.52] P:1628.42 E:0.058302 |  spirit great togetherness and some really really clinical sharp shooting from Michael Owen during
[5939.60 - 5943.68] P:1793.69 E:0.061482 |  yes they have a bit of self-belief there for them as well it went for them once or twice
[5943.68 - 5947.68] P:1747.92 E:0.062846 |  you've got to give them credit they stuck at it and I think they look better actually
[5947.68 - 5951.68] P:1798.17 E:0.062543 |  once they've got Gary McAllister onto the field because what he does he starts to
[5951.68 - 5956.16] P:1851.90 E:0.061177 |  thread the ball through a little bit better than that but prior to that I thought they
[5956.16 - 5960.88] P:1786.69 E:0.063593 |  defenced it extremely well and in saying that so too did Adams and Keoghler we're outstanding
[5960.88 - 5966.00] P:1784.85 E:0.063602 |  really for most of the game meanwhile in the other half it's the usual scene here Arsenal can't
[5966.00 - 5970.48] P:1796.37 E:0.054631 |  believe it most of their players have just been sitting on the ground some of them just lying
[5970.48 - 5975.28] P:1800.46 E:0.059254 |  completely for lawn Thierry Henri I wonder what's going through his mind he knows he will know that
[5975.28 - 5980.08] P:1822.83 E:0.057201 |  he's missed a couple of great chances here for Arsenal who will now end the season in terms of
[5980.08 - 5985.60] P:1879.19 E:0.057449 |  trophies of course empty-handed Liverpool are about to get their hands on the FA cup in a few
[5985.60 - 5990.32] P:1887.43 E:0.059508 |  moments time it is now being engraved of course the name of Liverpool is being engraved on the cup
[5990.40 - 5996.32] P:1756.96 E:0.062351 |  in the meantime here's Mark and they're just building that presentation platform from which
[5996.96 - 6000.64] P:1787.51 E:0.057508 |  Liverpool will receive the FA cup shortly we'll be back with Mike let's go down onto the pitch
[6000.64 - 6005.68] P:1595.07 E:0.060322 |  though Steve Wilson's been with the Liverpool team today Steve absolute bedlam in this half of the
[6005.68 - 6011.04] P:1474.08 E:0.061172 |  field I mean 15,000 of these Liverpool fans are going to go straight from Cardiff to Dortmund I
[6011.04 - 6016.56] P:1446.42 E:0.061925 |  would think it's barely worth going back north to Merseyside they must have thought that they
[6016.56 - 6022.64] P:1469.99 E:0.062041 |  weren't going to win it Gerard Hulier is absolutely beaming from ear to ear he's caked in sweat I
[6022.64 - 6027.44] P:1505.57 E:0.060611 |  think he's been through everything this afternoon meanwhile on the pitch I mean the players who
[6027.44 - 6033.36] P:1608.65 E:0.058770 |  weren't involved the players who didn't even get out of their suits look like they are as ecstatic
[6033.36 - 6038.48] P:1613.11 E:0.057878 |  as even Michael Owen who scored the two winning goals of course which I think says something about
[6038.48 - 6044.00] P:1568.10 E:0.057722 |  the team spirit which Gerard Hulier has instilled in this Liverpool side Jamie Carragher is standing
