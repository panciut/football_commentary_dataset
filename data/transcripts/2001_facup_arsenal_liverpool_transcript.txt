 Vengas Arsenal look like this, Seaman in goal, a back four of Dixon, Keown, Adams and Cole. In midfield we have Ljungberg, Grimondi, Vieira and Perez, an upfront two more French World Cup stars Sylvain Wiltor and Thierry Henri. The substitutes for Arsenal today are Manninga, Parler, Burgkamp, Kanu and Lorraine. What a substitutes bench. Gerard Julier's Liverpool line up like this, Vesterbilt in goal, across the back, Barbel, Hoopier, Henshaw and Carriga. In midfield we have Gerard Murphy, Haman and Smitsa. At upfront Michael Owen is paired with Emil Heskey which means that another England striker Robbie Fowler is on the bench and with Robbie Fowler on the bench we have Arfexhad, Berger, McAllister and Vignole. Okay let's go straight off and join our commentary team there, Jimmy Armfield, Mike Ingham and first of all Alan Green. The referee is Steve Dunn and let me run down the two liners. First of all Arsenal will be playing in the normal strip of red shirts with white sleeves, white shorts and white socks. Seaman is the goalkeeper, the defenders are Dixon, Keown, Adams and Cole. In midfield Lombard, Vieira, Grimondi and Perez and the strikers Wilthood and Henri. Liverpool in their goal shirts with Navy flashes, Navy shorts, going to Huddle, a customary Huddle even though Robbie Fowler isn't in the starting line up. Their line up Vesterbilt's the goalkeeper, the defenders are Babel, Onscho, Uppia and Carragher. A midfield of Murphy down the right it seems at the start, Gerard, Hermann and Schmitzer, then Heskey and oh and Steve Dunn is the referee, he's taken the signals from both linesmen and the 2001 FA Cup final sponsored by AXA is underway at a stadium that is truly a magnificent venue. At which point we welcome listeners to the BBC's World Service, wherever you are, I hope it's as nice a day as it is here in the Welsh capital. Glory is sunshine, sweltering temperatures, it's normal FA Cup final weather. Liverpool attacking the goal to our right and defending the tough end in the first half, Havapole, Uppia, the captain to Gerard, on to Babel and Babel is beaten by Perez and Henri takes it up, Wilthood ahead of him but it's a good ball to Perez, left back to the penalty area, he's into the Liverpool penalty area though it's a good tackle by Babel and it's behind for a corner to Arsenal, Jimmy. Yes well first corner to Arsenal, it was an error by Babel, he gave the ball away on the half-were line and they broke very quickly and in the end he had to do well the German there to rescue it, corner kick to Arsenal, from there left and Perez to take it, Perez he scored the winning goal in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, right footed, turning in and a good catch by Vesterbilt, who awkwardly for him in this first half is looking into the sunshine, there's only about a quarter of the grind, he's basking in sunshine at the moment but certainly Vesterbilt's goals involved, Murphy looking for O on the far side and Michael O on six goals in his last three games, collects it, left edge of the Arsenal penalty, into it, good run by O and pulls it back and it's knocked away by Adams, how to play in the far side, throw in to Liverpool, well real threat already, a lovely ball from Murphy, I thought from the half-were line, good vision, Murphy nicked on the outside of Dixon as well which just me a little bit worrying for Arsenal's defense, Adams to the rescue, very bright start, Carragher with the throw in, few yards from the corner fly, into the penalty here it goes, Heskey jumps, heads it back, Murphy jumps two, drops kindly for Arsenal and Dixon 37 years of age, slashes it upfield to safety and then there's a foul by Onery on Hubea and it's a free kick to Liverpool inside the centre circle, by the way I mentioned listeners to the BBC World Service in particular today, we think of those in Ghana, you may not know but before kickoff there was a minute silence in memory of all of those who died recently in terrible football tragedies around the world but in particular the one that happened in a crowd, here's Owen for Liverpool, tackled by Perez, ball breaks well though to Gerard, Gerard to Babel, down the Liverpool right, into Hamar, back to Stephan Altshaw once more, Altshaw, only Hubea at festival, inside the Liverpool half, everybody else in Arsenal, terrific, it's cleared by Q'n and collected by Lumber, over the half-were line, Freddie Lumber and then to the left and Xieori Onery and Onery's going to take on Altshaw and Pete's Onery goes across, Onery crosses, Carragher stabs it away right footed, good clearance by the England defender and it's out of play for a throw into Arsenal, what a great right start, terrific, I'm just going to say Altshaw, terrific start, great run down the left hand side, he likes coming down this left hand side Onery, got the ball into the box really, it was a good clearance in the end, I thought he showed a lot of pace there Onery down this left hand side, three minutes play in the 120th FA Cup final, Arsenal 0, Liverpool 0, Dixon back to David Seymour, you know this Arsenal offense Jimmy collectively is 32 years older than the Liverpool back five, it's a fair job to try and replace when I was talking to Mike about it this morning, we're trying to replace those, I mean it's a very big enough problem trying to replace Winterburn initially you know but it's there we go, they've done a fantastic job and Steve was alongside us here, we've one of them as well, throwing on the fast side to Arsenal, inside their own half, Dixon to take it, Dixon has got Grimondi inside so too is the error, tuned behind him, he's looking further down the line though towards Wilchard and Wilchard comes and it's thrown towards the Frenchman who takes it on his chest, a Liverpool thought he might have handled it, not so but Liverpool win the ball back and Hopiah tries to clear it, hits the back of Carragher and rebounds out of play on the fast side, throw in to Arsenal, St. Johnston one done the United Nils from Scotland, this is the FA Cup final though, Arsenal Nils, Liverpool Nils, Dixon on the far side, plays it in awkwardly and then there's a foul on Michael Owen and it's a free kick to Liverpool, Gerard takes it quickly but too quickly, Schmitz is offside, there was a very bright free kick, well he was and it's been a very encouraging start, both sets of players, particularly midfield players, prepared to get forward there, Schmitz has started out on the left hand side, very quick free kick by Gerard who started in the centre midfield, he just went a little bit early and did Wilchard there from Grimondies pass and that's another free kick to Liverpool, I think it's bound to settle down Jimmie, I can't imagine if we're going to have a tack after a tack, no it's bound to be a tight match, it's been a very good start, I was very impressed by Omri's run down this left hand side, he went past on-shows, he wasn't there really and he went so quickly with it that Arsenal just couldn't get a forward player up in support of him, Vestibel well out of his penalty area to take this free kick for Liverpool, right footed and drill towards the right side very accurately, straight to Marcus Babel the right fullback, midway inside the Arsenal half to Murphy, a man behind him, Murphy tried a more ambitious pass, didn't come off but it rebounds, can't lead to Onscho, Onscho lifts it to the edge of the Arsenal penalty area and Adams heads it to the left, Ashley Cole keeps it in play, oh lovely flick on by Omri from Cole's back, Wilchard over the halfway line, Omri down the left, Gerard gets in, wonderful tackle by Steven Gerard, fantastic challenge that was, short fantastic pace as much as anything and then to challenge from behind, got a clean win of the ball, Carragher to Gerard and we've seen a lot of Steven Gerard in these opening minutes and hardly anything about Patrick Vieira, here's Babel, Babel looking for Hesky and from Murphy, Adams gets in between the two Liverpool players and clears it simply to Perez, Perez now approaching the halfway line, Vieira to his right and it goes on, he first to back to Vieira and Vieira looking for the runner Perez through the middle of the Liverpool defence, overheads the pass and it's through to Best of Oaks. Yeah it's a bit adventurous that you know I don't think Liverpool are going to give a go all the way too easily for the player just running right down the centre of the field there, it's very difficult ball to get onto. Carragher for Liverpool, left of the centre circle, back to the captain, Kofiha follows on the bench, the other Liverpool substitutes by the way are McCallister, Berger, Dignal and Erfexad, meantime it's upfield for Liverpool to Hesky, Hesky breaks in between two defenders and he definitely just fell over there on 80, it wasn't a foul challenge by Grimondi and rightly it was ignored by Steve Dunn, the Arsenal substitutions, Weninger, Harler, Canu, Burkamp and Lauren, here's Owen for Liverpool and the cleverly wins the corner for Fannin and arguably those being a bright start by both teams, Liverpool have started the brighter. Yes they have and what they're doing that said they're using the longer ball which is quite surprising and then the ball to Hesky, he chased it out to the left hand side, the last one came out to the right hand side, Michael Owen using his pace again, the both facing players had him just conceded the corner. Well Murphy who was certainly a surprise selection in the Liverpool team as far as I was concerned is to take the corner from the right in the shadow both hands are locked that's the signal played in deep, Owen and Krelfer Liverpool inside the penalty and it's still running for them but now it breaks down and it's cleared up field for Arsenal, Chiayi Henri on his own but getting support on the far side from Perez and Wilter, played to Wilter and Wilter tried to fully to pass into Perez and made no decent contact at all and finally he's tackled and beaten by Carragher but if the pass had come off Perez would have been through. I didn't play in the far side throwing to Arsenal. Yes well it's good to play that really but it was a good challenge by Carragher, he tried to get the ball to Smitser, Wilter though showed a lot of commitment chased after it, he's won himself for throwing by the corner flag. In the 90 degree he did the sunshine in the far side, Dixon with a throwing to Perez, chested back to Lee Dixon and now to Grimondi, Dixon wants more, inches in from the right tackler does well, gets past Smitser, crosses low, Hamann is there and Hamann lifts it clear left footed and Owen keeps it in play but knocks it back towards his penalty area, half cleared, the error from 30 yards shoots and it hit Henry and now it's breaking for Liverpool to Murphy and Murphy lashes it upfield and Adams is there with Keown at the combat, Heskey, Adams heads it away and Keown clears it right footed over the halfway line, Carragher jumps and heads it down and it goes to Steven Gerard and back to Hopiak. It's been warm in the Sun now, half of the ground as the game progresses the shadow is moving gradually across but it must be very warm on that far side but the players have shown terrific fitness you know that's started off with Pays of Terrific. Really good, here's Hamann for Liverpool who is in his customary role just sitting in front of the back four, Hamann again to On Show and Gerard's available and he goes to Gerard and Pierre comes close to Gerard who knocks it down the right flank, he knew the bubble was making the run, so to Adams who got across and may have been caught by the German and he was, his foot was a little bit high, I don't think there was anything particularly nasty in the challenge, he was a foul. No I live, don't worry, he's alright but what he did, he came steaming across to cover as he normally does and Babel kept his right foot there and I don't think he's too much of a knock he's got. I think he was playing the ball Babel, we played nearly 10 minutes you're listening to Sport on Five and the World Service on the BBC, you should be, this is where it really matters. Gary McAllister sitting on the Liverpool bench, a difference to the Sun has a tall over his bold plate, no surprise there, he is actually called for Arsenal, stabs it in field but only to Hamann, forward to Heskey and Heskey gets away, first of all from Keown, Keown gets in a second challenge, I didn't think either of the challenges by Keown actually were fair but he gets away with it and Arsenal take the ball forward on the left side, Perez infield from Gerard, takes the ball through the legs of Hamann, good one by Robert Peres, Dixon available in the far side, play towards Dixon, Carragher across, Dixon plays it in first time and hopefully a case for Liverpool, up to the halfway line, Keown knocks it forward again and too far forward behind for a goal kick. Well that was a good bit of play really particularly by Peres, it was almost down in front of us, in the shadow of this stand here, came in from the left hand side he went past a couple of challenges, whipped the ball across to the right though just slightly over hit but so there was no finale to it, there's not been a shot on goal yet so far, we've just had one effort, 35 yards from Vieira that was blocked, nothing else though for the goalkeepers to be worried about. That's to build with a goal kick for Liverpool, Worthington Cup one is in this stadium a couple of months ago and on course for an unprecedented trouble knowing these teamers ever won three cup finals in the same season, Schmitzer back to Hamann, left to the centre circle and plays it back to Stephan Olschow, one of the two centre backs for Liverpool. Olschow to the other centre back, Hopiah and now on to Carragher the left full back, over the halfway line in the far side of the field, Lumberg comes close, it's on to Schmitzer, Schmitzer back towards Carragher but left by Carragher for Hopiah, Arsenal with everyone back inside their own half at the moment, 11 and a half minutes play, Arsenal little Liverpool little, Murphy chest the ball down to Gerard, on to Heskey, it was an awkward pass from Gerard, Heskey couldn't make much of it and Lumberg takes it away for Arsenal, tackled by Schmitzer on the far side but gets it back to Lee Dixon, well it's going to be heavily contested this match, what a very strong players out there particularly in the midfield, here's Robert Pires for Arsenal through the centre circle, on to Henri, Henri's that first time passing that will do it but nowhere near him, Vaval to Murphy and Murphy to Heskey, Heskey couldn't take that, kindly little lunch from Tony Adams, just helped put Heskey off and Arsenal have the ball again, Vieira to Henri and now Pires and Wilter, Frenchman all, Pires was he called there by her man, it was actually a bad pass from Pires so he's quite lucky to get the free kick because otherwise the ball was going out for Liverpool through it, yeah it's just slightly late there, how long have we played Alan now with this new watch across, 13 minutes, you like it, you like it, you know I've made I mean in honour of the FA Cup final I've given Michael my watch but no doubt he'll break it permanently now, but I'll think you're right Alan, there's high pedigree footballers here, Pires with a free kick for Arsenal from the left flank into Dixon, Dixon back to Martin Keehn and Keehn just clips it forward and Vaval jumps, heads it away, her man heads it down and Murphy in the ball, he completely screws his clearance, dropping midway inside, deliver Paul half and then Carragher heads it to the half way line and interestingly Jimmy both teams are adopting the same tactics, when the other team has got the ball the opposition gets everybody back, I mean there we had everybody by a seaman inside the Liverpool half, yes it's almost it's like a two three one four you know it's a man it's a man who's playing just in front of the back for Liverpool, Gaborney for Arsenal and you've got the two strikers on both sides and the three players you know working in the middle area, much respect from one to the other, Tony Adams, St. Miran Nill, Aberdeen one in Scotland, this is Wales and this is all about England, the FA Cup final, Arsenal Nill, Liverpool Nill, Viera, Viera hits it to the left of Pires, Pires has actually Cole on the obelisk, Pires keeps the ball and then plays it off Murphy, it's going to be a throw in to Arsenal, it's going to be some difficulty passed either of these defences, Cole with a throw in to Pires, back to Cole and now Viera, very quiet so far Patrick Viera in the opening 14 minutes, Grimondi to Wilchard and Wilchard with a good pass to Keown over the half way line right at the centre circle and Martin Keown drifts it infield, easier deception by Hermann and Carragher clears it to Gerard, Gerard with lots of red shirts around him almost loses the ball but Carragher helps him out, takes it forward and then hits it long rather hopefully for Heskey, Adams across and Adams heads it away to Dixon, Dixon tackled by Schmitzer, balls out of play throw in to Arsenal. Schmitzer can't get in the game just at the moment, there has been quite a lot of the play on this side of the field but he just can't get into it. The throw in's fully 30 yards short of the half way line though, Dixon's creeping ever so near before he takes the throw in, towards Wilchard, skips off the head of Carragher and drops to Hoope, so far the pitch seems to be holding up quite well, it must have been a far long Carragher on the far side, referee spots it, free kick to Liverpool pushing on Jamie Carragher, Carragher takes the free kick to Hoope, and now to his right to Ancho and towards our commentary vision, the Liverpool right in this first half, Babel, into Ancho once more, a walking pace at times and the heat, Ancho's ball forward easily headed away by Cole, then the error almost trips on it, stabs it forward though successfully to Wilchard, and Wilchard sweeps it to the Arsenal right and lead Dixon, he takes it on his chest, down to his feet, infield to Grimondi, on re-looking just outside the penalty, Grimondi trying to find him but it was headed away neatly by Carragher and here's Gerard, Heskey peels away to the left and Gerard looks to pick him out, Jones quickly across there aware of the danger and Jones going to try to shepherd that ball behind for a goal kick which he's all successful. Yes, I'm sure this long ball that Liverpool are playing is a genuine tactic to start off with, that's about the third now we've had that's been struck from the centre field out wide towards the corner flag, trying to use the pace of Heskey and Oye. And that rumour that Heskey would be up front in his own was just that, a rumour, I never thought it likely. Well I mean Oye's been on fire recently you know. Well you wouldn't stick him in midfield after he scored six goals in three games, would you? Not if you're of any side mind, 16 minutes play and that's also the reason frankly why you know Robbie Fowler couldn't make the starting line up, hope he doesn't get a challenge in the ball properly and the ball breaks to Lumber, centre of the Liverpool half, Dixon available now doing the right for some width, on to Lumberg again, who's gone wide, carrier close by, back to Dixon and Dixon with a crossfield ball, 40 yards to Ashley Cole, Cole immediately controls the ball and runs forward but runs straight into Danny Murphy and now it's with Gerard, to Murphy again, Heskey's available on the halfway line and it goes to Emil Heskey, where's the support for Heskey, there isn't any, he's tackled and beaten by Vieira and on it goes to Henry, he's definitely outside, a round festival, Arsenal must score, Henry shoots wide, he's paving for handball not given what a waste by Terry Henry. Well it was, that's the real chance, there was a real chance then because it was a simple ball really, it was looking for a lot of possession, they lost possession around the halfway line and the ball was knocked through, I thought at first he was offside but it clearly wasn't but when he came in from the right hand side he was appealing that the ball had been handled on the line, now we haven't the best angle of it. Well I'll tell you the replay isn't conclusive, the hand was sort of waving around there but I'm not sure that it didn't hit the post, I think it hit the post on my behind for a goal kick. Anyway here's Owen for Liverpool, Owen approaching the Arsenal half, he's fouled there by Adam, referee let's play off, now Vieira fouls Owen, now you can't let that go, he's definitely clenched by Adam's and the referee rightly played advantage but Vieira got Owen the second time. Yes it was a foul and referee Steve Dunn's having a word with him, you know what he's done, he's just had a quiet word with him, it's just said to him right now we've all had a go, here we are. Free kick to Liverpool, Haman strikes it, straight at Grimondi and I'm sure Seaman was right about that, Haman and Seaman have a history to remember at Wembley, Murphy back to Gerard, Gerard sweeps the cross in, not headed away convincingly by Arsenal, Schmitzer chasing the way to the far side, that was a gold-bun shot by Haman by the way, here's Schmitzer coming forward towards the Arsenal penalty area and he's tackled by Steve Dunn, ball breaks again to Schmitzer, couldn't make much use of it, Haman shoots again, I think he's got a shoot on sight there, philosophy this afternoon against David Seaman but Arsenal come forward into the Liverpool half, Henri for Arsenal to Grimondi, Henri definitely should have scored, great tackle by Gerard and Gerard pass over the halfway line, on to his right, goes to Michael Orton, taking in his chest, yard outside the penalty, great run by Heskey and then Adams got his body between Orton and the ball and I think that was a fair challenge by Adams and excited playing, it's a throw in to Arsenal. Yes well Adams' experience there was very important to Arsenal because Gerard did ever so well, it took the ball off Grimondi on the halfway line, putting it up to Orton, Orton tried to get on the outside of Adams, just right across him, there's no foul experience, Gerard's the dominant figure in the game so far and he's opening 19 minutes but it's Arsenal now, Liverpool now and it is very very tight as we expected it to be. Well they've had a great chance Arsenal to be in front of Orton right there, it'd be interesting to see about you know he claimed for the penalty kick, there wasn't many other people claim for it but I think he claimed to help his embarrassment frankly at missing the chance, here's Babel over the throw in for Liverpool, almost level with the edge of the Arsenal penalty here and Babel can certainly reach that penalty area whereas Heskey at the moment just a few yards in front of the penalty spot, here comes Babel up to the touch line, high for Heskey, oh and shoots, blocked by Keown, that was goal by, oh that's a great shot in by Gerard, high and over. In form blocked by Keown, ball was coming in from that right hand side and when it broke out there was another shot coming in at distance this time from Gerard, not quite as accurate as I've seen him once or twice, he's gone over the top but it's been an explosive start to this match. 20 minutes gone exactly. I'll tell you what was very interesting about that Gerard shot, it went very close to the hand down the head of Martin Keown, very very close and Keown just pulled his hand away in time. Arsenal now Liverpool now in the 2001 FA Cup final and this is World Service in five live on the BBC, thanks very much indeed for listening. Martin Keown for Arsenal as always in his red boots to the slightly red-haired Freddie Lumberg, nothing natural about that, to Cole, Cole on to Omri, Omri to Wilthood, Wilthood is coffee behind him, Wilthood swoops it to the far side along the ground to Dixon and the Arsenal right into Wilthood, tackled by Gerard and the ball breaks to Schmitz, Schmitz has played not great, Babel helps it on, Murphy collects and Murphy does well to hold off the air, back to Babel and Babel to the far side towards Vladimir Schmitz, Dixon went to meet it, didn't get it and it's now with Gerard, still short of the half way line, back to Carragher, Carragher for Liverpool, back to walking pace especially in that sunshine it's understandable, now I hope you, 21 minutes played, nil nil between Arsenal and Liverpool, my betting, my bet was always on a one goal victory for one of these teams, I don't see many goals here, on show over the halfway line right at the centre circle, Murphy's made a run forward, the pass was short, didn't reach Heskey but Heskey wins it off the air, the air not on form yet, here's Murphy, Murphy tries to play through the legs of Adams, rebound to Heskey, Heskey shoots, takes an affliction off Adams, corner to Liverpool, shoot onside once or twice, now we've had about three or four goals from distance, both teams I think that was a bit adventurous from Heskey, I don't think it was going anywhere but it's got an affliction, Liverpool have won three corners already, you don't get a goal for a corner though do you, nope that doesn't matter, now for that, corner to Liverpool from the right, Danny Murphy to take it and both arms go up again, that's the signal, that usually means it's deep for Liverpool, it's played in deep towards Heskey, too deep, headed away by Adams, on show waits, on show, plays it away to the far side towards Smiths, important header away by Dixon and the ball's back in the halfway line with Carrager and all the way back to Sander Vesterbilt, can forget his age, Dixon's been a terrific player and he's still a good player for Arsenal, he just showed up you know all his experience there, anticipated the ball going, Gerard heads it on to Heskey, back it goes to Murphy, Murphy shoots a weak shot from Murphy and Arsenal shoot clear, midway through the first half, Arsenal little Liverpool little and here's my kick, well it may not be Wembley but it feels like the cup final, it's a wonderful atmosphere and Arsenal have a free kick, Vieira's been fouled, Arsenal playing from right to left, Pyrrhus shapes to take it and then just knocks it sideways all of three or four yards to Vieira, Vieira still by his stand is struggling to take the game here by the scruff of the neck, Jungberg on the half-way line and so congested down there, as Alan and Jimmy have been saying, very few chances and Henri's missed the best ones so far, it's now Grimondi jumping over the challenge, threads it towards Wiltord, Neerside just on the edge of the area, faced by Stefan Onscho, dinks the ball into the area, a little high for Henri, overhead kick in the end five yards wide. It's a class act Henri and I think even for him that was a bit adventurous on the edge of the box trying an overhead kick, you have a lot to see another replay of that ball when he comes in from the left hand side, oh we're going to see one now, funny in front of us now and the ball actually what it did in the post, it onscho on the arm and went behind so perhaps his call was right for a penalty. It's a brilliant atmosphere in Cardiff over the last 24 hours, it's almost felt like building up to a European Cup final here and Patrick Vieira now disputing midfield with Murphy but Murphy's there first, Haman he's looking for some options and eventually Babel typically with his stocking roll down, chips the ball in with his right foot, it's going to be too high for Michael and Adams just waits for it to come on to him and then just drops it at Ashley Cole's feet and Cole moving across the pitch almost lost that to Heskey in the end, digs it away from him and now Henri sets off and here comes Henri with his pace, gets away from Haman, Lungberg's made the run through the area, the pass from Henri was just in front of Lungberg but nevertheless Arsenal win a corner. Great play again by Henri, he's the problem, he's the problem at the moment, it's his pace and his control of the ball as well, it's a lovely run off the ball by Lungberg but fortunately for Liverpool, Antjo was there just kicking away, 24 and a half minutes gone in the Cup final, 0-0 and for the first time we see Keown and Adams inside the Liverpool penalty area, Vieira is always dangerous, some set pieces as well in it goes, Vestival struggling a bit to get that one away and the referee has the whistle gone now, the play continues over on the far side, Heskey's looking a little bit groggy, Arsenal retrieve the ball and they work it back inside the penalty area but Grimondi can't get hold of that in the air against Babel and eventually breaks wide of Vestival for Liverpool goal kick. Yes, pretty's not the corner in there and Vestival was in there with Heskey and he fell rather awkwardly on his own, could it be all right, he seems to hobbling away towards the halfway line now. Sander Vestival has played over 50 games this season for Liverpool, just settles himself away to our left, just a little bit of sunshine still in that penalty area, this side of the stadium completely shaded as Vestival strikes the goal kick right footed into the Arsenal half, it's going to be Keown against Emil Heskey, away by Vieira and now Lungberg who's drifted in field from that far side needs a little bit of help, Dixon as ever will be there, 598th competitive appearance today by Lee Dixon, his ball across field was very ambitious, it was cut out by Danny Mills, surprise selection today, he uses Babel and gets it back again, Murphy near side the Liverpool right, poor control from Haman and Liverpool have been caught out as Arsenal break now with Henri, goes away from Ancho, Wiltaud's in the area, Henri's ball in though it's behind Wiltaud and there are three Liverpool players there, Gerard will take it away from the danger zone and clear up towards the half-way line but he won't reach Heskey headed back by Dixon, Liverpool still looking to try and cross the half-way line, Hopi is tackled by Lungberg and Arsenal now with Grimondi looking to try and feed Henri once more, wasn't a great ball open to the Frenchman, Babel's there and a bit of space now for Danny Murphy down below on the Liverpool right, immediately faced by Vieira, Murphy back to Haman, Arsenal nil Liverpool nil in the cup final and we've played 26 and a half minutes in Cardiff, now Carragher down the Liverpool left hand side over on the far side in the sunshine, Haman who played in that cup final two years ago for Newcastle against Manchester United, and would rather forget about it really, wasn't the happiest of days for him, Haman once more all on his own inside the centre circle, takes the ball inside the Arsenal half, lays it off to Steven Gerard and so many Arsenal players back behind the ball, long one again in from Gerard, over hit though, can't find Heskey, Siemens though. It wasn't about a ball though that, it was a lovely ball, chip forward, you'd right weight on it as well really, Heskey was a difficult ball though for a striker, you know when your ball's coming over your head and you're running down the centre of the field, central defenders there, it's much easier for the central defenders who see the ball coming all the way. Maybe the cup final, maybe that can be the Millennium Stadium, but Phil Thompson's still going to prowl around over on that far side in the technical area, barking a few instructions, whether they can be heard in an atmosphere like this, now Martin Keown with a long ball for Arsenal, Liverpool will leave that, hoping that Vestervolt's there, very awkward bounce though and Omri was in there challenging Vestervolt in the end a good recovery though by the Dutch goalkeeper and then a very neat under arm throw to feed Hamann who presumably called for it. Omnagidani Murphy, centre circle, another long one from Murphy and Keown is just caught out as Heskey takes it inside the area, Smits has gone forward, Heskey on his right foot, good block though by Keown and more, Heskey could have been a bit sharper there because there were players looking to be serviced from him after that initial error from Keown and now the error, the error seemed to be played into difficulty but he gets away with great strength from Murphy, it's now Robert Pires near side onto Thierry Henri, he's only got one goal in the FA Cup this season of penalty, Omri 25 yards out, Wiltorre's waiting, Omri steps over the ball and finds Pires on the left hand side, so many goal shirts from Liverpool though inside the penalty area, so tight in the Cup final, Nil Nil, Vieira now, strong right-footed ball too strong for Ljungberg and it's a goal kick against Liverpool. Well it was a great attack but it was tentative, there was no support play there for Omnri, the only player who really made the effort to make a forward run there was Wiltorre down the right hand side, Ljungberg was coming up on the right but he had to actually run across the box, Omri turn round and come back, Liverpool had seven players behind the ball, it's very difficult at the moment for the forward players. Just got a picture of Arsene Wenger, feeding the heat a little, he's taken his jacket off, he's got a mauve purple shirt over there, just wondering and obviously reflecting on the miss by Omnri, now good tackling, terrific tackle by Adams, Liverpool players gone down, I think it might be Danny Murphy, it's now Robert Pires of Arsenal trying to get that through to Wiltorre, well closed down by Omnri, they'll need to stop the game, there is an injury problem with Danny Murphy and the referee now has seen it and he's just going to see whether Murphy needs attention, he doesn't. Well they're offside down here, down there, it's going to be a free kick down at this bottom end, it's a good block by Omnri but Murphy got a knock on his ankle and it's a challenge by Adams. This is the Cup final and you're listening to Five Live or BBC World Service from Cardiff, it's nil nil between Liverpool and Arsenal, we've almost played a third of the Cup final and it's just as tight as we thought it would be. A Gerard, tackle by the error and Omnri's got the ball, back comes typically Gerard, can't get the ball away from Omnri though, Omnri with his great close control down the left hand side but they're short again in the penalty area, there's any Wiltorre there, they now try to find Dixon over on the far side, this is a problem sometimes for Arsenal, ball poorly cleared by Liverpool, Grimondi shot is still at Vestival and at times Arsenal struggling to get the numbers in the penalty area, some in Liverpool players back and now Babel on the half way line, another long ball, Heskey's given offside. Yes there was no real support for Omnri again when he came down this left hand side with the ball, Lungberg trying to make a late run, Carragher got it away and Grimondi tried a shot, 35 yards, easy picking for Vestival. Batrugera slowly conserving the energy, Lungberg foul by Steven Gerard, inside the centre circle, Steve down the referee, gives a free kick to Arsenal just inside the Liverpool half, Arsenal playing from right to left, well Lungberg, well yeah referees has dropped it back another couple of yards to where the offense actually took place and now Vieira just smoothly finds his captain Adams, Adams switches, Viers to the right hand side, slow build up from Arsenal, Vieira now on to Grimondi, seemed a bit surprised to get that one, now Dixon over on the far side, down the line to Wiltor, he can't go past Jamie Carragher though, well tied it up by Liverpool and Heskey at the moment playing at left back and cleared by Hopier but that's a rather reckless clearance straight back to Arsenal, Vieira wants more centre circle, on to Pires who's gone in field to make it even more congested, Pires now going down the right hand side feeds Lungberg, Wiltor's in the area, Cross doesn't come in though from Lungberg and it wins a throw in off Jamie Carragher but the last three or four minutes a bit better from Arsenal, yes it was nice little run from Pires, it's the French players really looking active for me, they've got a bit of spark in the players well, Pires, Henri Wiltor, could run off the ball there from Lungberg, Liverpool have blocked it, Dixon's throw down to Wiltor, six goals in the FA Cup, Cross coming in from Dixon, easy header away by Hopier who played in this stadium for Finland, it's now back again with Vieira, it's a good ball from him to Pires, Arsenal, oh as the ball was threaded through, Lungberg looks to the Lionsman over on the far side claiming he was tripped by Carragher but nothing doing from the Lionsman, nothing doing from the referee and Vesterbalt clears to Marcus Babel, Babel up against Pires, immediately closed down though by the Frenchman, Babel's in retreat and goes back once more to Vesterbalt who controls the ball on the edge of his area and will now clear and he'll reach the Arsenal half, Keown jumping with Heskey once more, taken well on the chest by Heskey and a little foul by Keown, free kick to Liverpool, almost halfway inside the Arsenal half down the centre of the field and Haman will step forward once more, it was that sort of range of course when he beats Seaman at Wembley but this time he takes it short, Gerard now, poor ball by Gerard, easily cut out by Cole, Cole onto Pires, Pires with Henri on the outside, lovely quick feet from Thierry Henri, getting away from Gerard and Babel, Henri again, oh I don't know what he was trying to do there, hit it straight towards Wiltor, there was no way he was going to get that one, once more Vesterbalt picks up the loose ball in the penalty area. It's gone a bit defensive, then the game has actually gone a bit defensive in the last sort of 10 minutes as very few players really looking to join the front players and attack the midfield players, just one at a time going as opposed to two or three, you know really supporting the front players, consequently people like Henri, Wiltor, Owen, Neske, I mean to go it alone a little bit. Best chance of the game so far, Henri missed it and Liverpool haven't really created a direct opportunity yet in the game, as Carragher now shovels the ball down the left hand side, Smits are very quiet so far up against Lee Dixon and he's won the corner kick, he's done very well there by the Miesmitser, corner kick to Liverpool, something out of nothing certainly and now a chance for Huppier to go forward and what usually happens here and it's very dangerous, it's like Jack Charlton used to do for Leeds in the 60s, Huppier normally just stands in front of the goalkeeper, corner kick to Liverpool over on the far side of the field, Smits are to take it, Huppier standing just in front of David Seaman, Michael Owen looking for a knock on, Babel's gone forward as well, Hamann lurking on the edge of the area and it comes, Seaman's missed it and cleared by Pires but the whistle's gone, presumably for a foul, didn't see it myself, free kick to Arsenal. Yeah he seemed to go for the ball and Steve Dunn was blown very quickly because the ball locked in from the left hand side, there was two or three players, I think he went for it and I think he missed it. There we go, free kick to Arsenal, I think just at this moment I think you're right about Liverpool, I think they're just lacking a little bit of construction in the middle of the field to me and you know there's not much support really, when the ball is knocked over at the top and we've been watching people like Heskey and Owen have run out to the flank but you know there's been nothing there behind them when they've actually got the ball. Henry made his way to the left hand side, instinctively knowing Seaman's kick would be aimed towards him but then Wiltor gets into trouble and Liverpool try to escape and Dixon's just taken Schmitzer out of the game and that's a free kick to Liverpool inside the centre circle, Hermann knocks it to his fellow German Babel, they'll both be in Germany of course on Wednesday with Liverpool in the wafers cup, you'll hear that on five live, now Babel down the line to Murphy, Liverpool near Arsenal, near in the cup final still and we've 10 minutes left in the first half and it's just as tight as we thought it would be. Interesting Michael, we're just looking, we've played what 35 minutes now and David Seaman really has another shot to save so far, nothing really too much gone towards him, there's a couple of long long distance efforts, one very good one from a man that was blocked but nothing really much and that just because in general a little bit of concern I would have thought at this moment. Now Liverpool play it from right to left across the pitch to Carragher but he can't go forward, Lundberg's closing him down well and Sammy Huppier is there, that's a long left-footed ball by Huppier which Martin Keown's anticipating and again it just trickles away disappointingly for a goal kick to Arsenal, they've only met before today in the FA Cup once since that 1971 final and in those days they just used to keep playing on and they played four times eventually, they settled the semi-final back in 1980 when Brian Tolbert got the winner at Coventry for Arsenal and Arsenal went on to lose the final against Trevor Rooking in West Ham, here with just under 10 minutes left in the first half, Arsenal nil, Liverpool nil, Liverpool have got the much better record against Arsenal in recent years, it's Thierry Henry who should have scored, tries to flick the ball onto Pyrrhus, Murphy just nudges it out of play, Henry if you weren't with us earlier actually went round Vestervilt and then from the angle couldn't find the target. I think it was very difficult to tell off the replay even you know but his shots seemed to hit the post and then it caught on Sean the elbow and went away but it was the best chance certainly. Cole onto Pyrrhus left hand side, it's all the little slow and predictable though and Liverpool have got everybody back inside their own half, Grimondi just coaxes the ball back to Keown short of the half-way line, Keown lines up his options and then a nothing sort of ball really towards Thierry Henry and Babel just lets that one bounce and will measure a clearance for Liverpool towards Heskey on the half-way line, you will get it though Adams is in there first, header on by Vieira, Carrigas appealing for offside, the game continues though, Lungberg deserting his right-sided position, finds Dixon who's in that more authentic right-sided position now, Wiltord's waiting, the ball is played short to Lungberg, Lungberg onto Grimondi, Grimondi centre of the field slants it towards us down this near side to Ashley Cole, Cole now onto Henry edge of the area, two Liverpool players up against Henry back again to Ashley Cole, Wiltord, Lungberg, Pires all inside the penalty area, it's not coming in though and it's really summing up the game, it's KG stuff, Cattenmouth stuff, ball out of play once more Arsenal throwing back to Pires, Liverpool 0 Arsenal 0 in the cup final, Pires now running across the field with the ball taking Hermione with him, Wiltord doesn't control it all played too quickly though on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area but a poor clearance by Liverpool and the air is header now tries to find Pires down the right-hand side just keeps it in, Pires now onto Freddie Lungberg across comes Hermione, Lungberg turning with Didi Hermione, Steele Lungberg twisting and turning over on the touch line, on good play from Lungberg onto Grimondi, Grimondi thought about the cross and in the end he didn't get the cross in, that's gone behind the dead ball line for a goal kick to Liverpool that was a poor play in the end. Well Arsenal are what I would call say calling the shots at them on what they're doing they're actually pushing Liverpool back but Liverpool have really found everything they've had to do at the back, it's a good challenge there first of all from Carragher then from Hermione you know after they've been beaten but I think Arsenal you know just passing the ball around a little more confidently. Seven minutes to go in the first half and this time Arsenal don't clear it but the referee just gets in the way there before Smith's a compounds for Liverpool, Smith's are still dribbling well over his side, in the end he gives it back to Carragher the left back over on the far side, now into central midfield, Hermione has to go backwards, finds Stefan Ancho back inside his own half, cross the central defence it goes to Sammy Hopier and then Gerard helps it across to the far side the field just kept in by Carragher, Smith's are against Dixon and Dixon sticking tight to Smith's, Smith's although still continues with the ball onto Danny Murphy just didn't run for Murphy though Adams was there away to Pires, great defending by both sides and now Robert Pires once more, Pires onto Wiltord, Wiltord has got Ljungberg on the outside, Ljungberg's got it, faced by Steven Gerard, Ljungberg still holds, Wiltord's available down that right hand side, back again to Ljungberg again only Henri though downfield, Ljungberg back again to Wiltord, down the right hand side Ashley Cole's gone into the area, ball still with Sylvain Wiltord onto his left foot doesn't get the crossing up against Carragher and Carragher's done well the defender and Carragher's avoided the corner kick as well it's a goal kick to Liverpool. Well what happened there really has typified the last sort of quarter of an hour to me, Arsenal in possession of the ball, Liverpool finding a defender there, Carragher stuck at it and stuck at it and stuck at it and he actually won a goal kick in the end. St Johnston too, Dundee United, Mill in Scotland and for the neutral at the moment Jimmy it's not a spectacle this cup final. No but it's the interest factor isn't it, which is anything you know for the for the sets of fans here they come to see their team win the cup so there's terrific interest from that point of view and it's that sort of game, it's a cagey game of course because you've got two pretty evenly much sides, strong at the back and neither side at the moment being too committed to go forward. A game in which chances really have to be taken there are going to be few of them and Henri's missed the only real chance of this first half and will Arsenal live to regret it? Liverpool again just cagey bringing the ball forward. It's warm on the field as well Mike I think you know I think it's just sort of taking its toll a little bit just as we're coming towards half time. The big hoop here, the captain in the absence of Fowler and Redknapp onto Heskey, Heskey now to Schmitzer over on the left hand side, refer to Patrick Berger in the starting lineup. Schmitzer still sorting himself out up against Lungberg now and Grimondi, needs help finds Carragher so good in that left-sided defensive position this season for Liverpool. There's talk though of course of Lizard Rezou coming here, coming to Liverpool and now Liverpool change the direction and fine on show onto Gerard, Gerard can't get the ball past Pires and the ball falls kindly to Thierry Henri. Henri onto Wiltor, centre circle just didn't come onto him as quickly as he wanted though. Wiltor again a slow build up from Arsenal from midfield though. Lungberg again drifting in field and the initial promise of this move has lost its sparkle. Pires again, Pires against Murphy, good challenge from Murphy. Ashley Cole picks up the loose ball, feeds Grimondi on the half-way line. Lungberg just taps it back into his own half to Adams and Adams spreads the play and Dixon now wants the ball over on the right hand side. Still Liverpool nil, Arsenal nil, three and a half minutes to go in the first half. We haven't had the physios on in the first half so there shouldn't be a lot of added time, maybe just one token minute from Stephen Dunn. Tony Adams onto Ashley Cole, nil-nil, Ashley Cole this would be a good time now for either of these two sides to score. Right on half time it's Pires back again to Cole. Such a slow build up here from Arsenal and now Grimondi, everybody apart from Heskey back behind the ball. Grimondi's long ball, Henri's given off side, whistle's just gone as Henri thought he was going to cut through and it's now St. Miran 1, Aberdeen 1 in Scotland. Jimmy. Yes now I think the Liverpool fans behind De Westerville's goal have been quietly relieved at that. It was a nice little chip forward by Grimondi and Henri must have just gone a little bit early, chesting it down on the left hand side with the Lyons have been in a very good position. Westerville prepares to take this kick, free kick it was, five yards outside the penalty area, hits it long, another typical towering leap from Martin Keown and then Lundberg seem to be held off over on the far side and Arsenal are going to have a free kick still back inside their own half. Gerard Houlier, yeah this is interesting, he's coming off the bench and he's making that signal which usually means come on get up a gear or two here lads, it's time to lift his side up isn't he? Yes he is, I think it's the midfield area too you know which you'd be a little bit concerned about, I think he's one of two people thinking about coming on McAllister's 1, quite clearly looking across there, you know he's got one of two options, you've got Berger as well of course. It'd be interesting to see you know what he's thinking about at the break. Well I think, I mean Alan's just drawing my attention to the fact that McAllister's going through a lot of exercises inside that tunnel here at the moment. The ball though is with Arsenal, Cross comes in from Lundberg, very difficult ball for Babel to take that one inside the penalty area, my word he had to get that one right and he just drops it safely out of play for an Arsenal throw in and so a lot of stretching, exercising going on from Gary McAllister and Liverpool perhaps need his flair in midfield in this game. The ball is back again with Adams on the half wayline, it's just a little bit laborious at the moment, a little bit workman-like from both sides. The ball is with Grimondi onto Dixon just inside the Liverpool half, Dixon over to Freddie Lundberg, ask him at the moment more of an attacking threat, Liverpool more or less in the last 10-15 minutes or so counter attacking and with quite a few long balls, Keo now down the centre, too high for Wiltord, away by Stephanon Scho, oh and the whistle's gone for Foulby-Heskey and the air has taken the free kick very quickly, who's played it into a crowded area, Wiltord can't find Ashley Cole, it's a great challenge on the ground from Marcus Babel, Babel's going to try and run the ball clear here and he's been fouled by Ashley Cole. Yes it was a foul, I mean it was good play by Babel that, it was a very good clearance just a moment ago when the ball came across from the right, he just sort of helped it on on the volley, difficult ball for a defender that, he's got to get it right as you said Mike, but looking across there, McAllister is warming up in the tunnel over there, sometimes you know the craft he plays, you know that's a way of a signal to tell the coach I'm ready to come on. Well me presumably for the second half he's not going to come on now, we've got 25 seconds of normal time and we'll try and pick out in the sunshine the fourth officials sign over on the far side but I can't believe it'll be more than a minute of added time. Long ball now from Liverpool and an easy catch for David Seaman who really, Jim, David Seaman I mean he's had nothing to do at all really, has he? No he hasn't, he just had that one awkward cross that he came out to you know that he missed completely, but he is a signal mark for the time factor. Can't see it from here can you? I think it's a minute isn't it? It has to be right, one minute which is pretty standard really when you haven't had the physios on the tour so one minute of added time and we have just moved into that now here in Cardiff, halftime, Liverpool near Arsenal, looks like that's going to be the score line, Marcus Babel last chance maybe for either of these two teams, good control from Babel down the right hand side, Babel's ball in the area asking an awful lot of Heskey and Murphy, wasn't well laid off there by Babel and he knew it as well and it's a goal kick once more to Seaman away to our right. Well those all campaigners at the back for Arsenal have looked very good, you know the three of them there, and Ashley, young Ashley Cole as well but the three in front of him, Dixon, Keown and Adams look very strong, they've protected Seaman very well, it's been very difficult for Rowan and Heskey in this first half. Now that goes the halftime whistle at the Millennium Stadium, Seaman applauds the Arsenal fans away to our right hand side, we've seen this many times over the years, he got off to a really promising start Jimmy didn't it, we didn't get the early goal and then it just fell into a rather predictable path. Yes I think the conditions you know have something to do with that, I've always believed that you know it's very hot, you know it is warmed down on the field today, then it does take its effect on the game itself as the half progresses, a little bit player fatigue comes into it, but I thought Arsenal shared that first half, I thought there was much more progression in their play and I think at this moment in time Jared Hulley will be getting trying to sort his midfield out because there's been very little or no support to the two front players who've had to really chase long balls and it's been very difficult, Arsenal's defence has looked very strong. Well this is the point really where I need Stuart Hall because the halftime score is Liverpool Null, Arsenal Null. You're listening to Sports World in the BBC World Service, we'll be back at the Millennium Stadium in good time for the second half of the Cup Final, no goals so far in Cardiff, we've also got plenty of other sports events to tell you about Formula One Cricket and Tennis for example. We're underway and Liverpool will be attacking the end to our left behind which is the River Taff here in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and here's Jared and Liverpool certainly need to show more adventure in this second half, bubble on the right side but Jared's pass was over and it's out of play, I agree with Jan Mulvey, Jimmy, I think it'll be Calistro beyond probably for Murphy within five or ten minutes. I didn't understand the selects to Murphy in the first place. Well I think the really heavily attacking from the attacking point of view, really Murphy, awesome mix really hasn't really got into the game so far and I'm sure you know Jared Ulli's talked a little bit about that you know during the break you know you've got to try and get these two into the game, we'll give them a period see if they can have any effect. Gremondi caught by Hamann who'd slipped from a previous challenge and it's a free kick to Arsenal inside their own half, it's been interesting but I've got to say it's another of these dull finals so let's hope the second half livens up enormously. The ball is with Tony Adams our Arsenal skipper inside his own half still short of the centre circle and I move forward and he clips it right foot it towards Ashley Cole on the left played back by Cole to Wilthorne and now here's Perez onto Ashley Cole again not over the edge of the Liverpool penalty area he's tackled by Babel Fogels at a play and it's a throw in to Arsenal, Arsenal attacking the end behind which the bulk of their supporters are. Cole in the sunshine in the far side and in the sunshine it's very hot here in Cardiff, the throw in goes to Wilthorne, Wilthorne with a man close by, Wilthorne's done well and then he must have overrun that ball surely, finally the linesman raises his flag and it's a goal kick to Liverpool. They're tight there even for Wilthorne, terrific pace, terrific acceleration, he got past a couple of challenges but he just couldn't keep it in play. I would have thought the important thing for Liverpool you know we should try and get the ball pass it around a little bit in the central area of the field, try and get the feel a bit a little bit better than they did in the first half that's what I would have said to if I'd have been Jared Hurley at the break. You just think the World Service and Five Limes in the BBC Arsenal little Liverpool and on the Cop Final, the FA Cop Final was that a little nudge by Keona and Owen, Owen regained his footing and now he's got Ashley Cole the battle within the far side and even though the linesman indicated it was a throw in the referee Steve Dunn saw some tugging by Cole and Owen and awards a free kick to Liverpool. I think the referee's right, what a free kick, I thought it really was a bit of immature to be able to give Cole a free kick away in that situation. Now Murphy was going to take this from the right and Hopi and Barber inside the penalty area played in deep, Heskey with the header, great save by statement, should have been 1-0 Liverpool, good reflex action for Meaglin goalkeeper and now Hopi adjusted right in the penalty area seemed to foul an Arsenal penalty team, well maybe he didn't think it was a foul at all but it has been given free kick to Arsenal but chance for Liverpool. Yes well the free kick came in there and for the first time really Heskey got free of Keon, he got the header in alright it was a bit difficult for him because he was a little bit of pressure, Seaman who's had to make his first real save there, just a warning for us, somebody who's a good save, very important save. Well actually the Heskey header in retrospect was probably too close to be a big problem but you've got to keep them out, balls on the halfway line with Fierro and Fierro, oh well he was tackled by all Fierro and the referee decides that's a foul and a free kick. Yes he's given it for a push, this is anything but there we go, Fierro went down, referee Steve Dunn was only about five bases away, here's Perez for Arsenal after that free kick and doesn't control it and Haman latches it over the halfway line, Adams heads it in the sunshine, how did it play and it's a throw in to Liverpool. Just shows all the you know the ball that Arsenal had in the first half there and Liverpool could easily have been ahead, just one moment really indecision, Keon, you couldn't get to it, Heskey got there and Seaman saved his team. I know you say Jimmy, but actually Liverpool has more shots than Arsenal in the first half, two each on target and two off targets from Liverpool, one off target from Arsenal. They don't get enough pleasure in the penalty area Arsenal when they're playing away from home and this is away from home for them. Yeah they just have a lot of possession really and they seem to be to be carrying more of a threat although it should be fair, it never really came, there wasn't that much went to Vestamela's goal if you take it as well. Babo to Haman, it's getting a little bit aggressive out there and he's brought down by Lumber, free kick to Liverpool, short of the halfway line and we played nearly five minutes to the second half, Arsenal little Liverpool now, Carragher for Liverpool and they're a waist strip of goal shirts with blue flashes, navy flashes, navy shorts, Arsenal of course in red and white. Now it's with Altschok, on to Murphy, he's got a little bit of room inside right shallon, played it behind Heskey and killed with the back pass to Seaman and Murphy likes to come in from the flank so he doesn't really provide with that sort of dismissor down the left hand side. Altschok, head Seaman's clearance back to the half way line, Vieira juggles with the ball and plays it to the left to Ashley Cole, Cole on to Wilthorne, back to Cole and to Pires who's tackle and foul from behind by Haman, that definitely is a free kick. That's not even the other card though, but he's letting go, nice and lean to change down the left hand side by Arsenal and Haman came in from behind, Pires is on his feet and it's going to be a free kick to be taken by Ashley Cole, Wilthorne and Ornby look around the edge of the penalty area, played short to Pires, Pires and Vieira on to the edge of the penalty, headed to Wilthorne, Wilthorne shot blocked by Babel and it's behind for a corner, well that was a very slight move from Arsenal, a lovely touch on by Ornby and Wilthorne got on to the volley as well and Babel who's, I think he's played well so far Babel and he just blocked it, he's gone off for a corner kick, he's played in the last three German cup finals as Marcus Babel for Bayern Munich and here in his second success of final in England for Liverpool, corner to Arsenal in front of their fans, away to Arn right, Perez to take it, Adams jockeying for position, so to is Vieira and Kjohn, played indeed towards Tony, other festivals nowhere and then Vieira heads the ball, Kjohn heads it down, into the penalty area, Wilthorne slips as he tried to take on Orncio and Orncio just allows the ball to trickle behind for a goal kick, I think it's in a very tight match like this, it's very important really, defenders you know keep the discipline at corner kicks, free kicks and so on, another opportunity there could have come across but in the end it just fiddled out because Wilthorne slipped, Vistabell took that goal kick very hurriedly and Arsenal have the ball back now, on the far side with Thierry Henri, left of the Liverpool penalty, moving in field and brought down and that's a free kick against a challenge by Stephan Orncio, yeah it was lovely play by Henri, just dipped his shoulder there, it was just a bit of a it was a bit of a drag back more than anything else by Orncio but it's about six yards outside the box, very close to the touch line, Robert Perez to take the free kick for Arsenal, here it comes, right footer chipped in, Vistabell punches when he should have called it perhaps, but the punches clear of the penalty area and now it's with Hamar who plays it cleverly off Lumberg, out of play for Etra O'Hent to Liverpool, important thing is for the goalkeeper there, he got it away as much as anything else, he got his fist onto the ball but he got it away and Liverpool have managed to scramble it, it started at a terrific pace again Jimmy, but not so now, I see Patrick Berger is out running around joining Gary McAllister behind David Siemens goal and Cal is one of the Arsenal substitutes limbering up at the moment, Arsenal little Liverpool now, Schmitzer for Liverpool, back to Gerard who started brightly and then has gone quiet, good pass to the far side though to Babel and Babel, tackled by Colbert Winslow-Paul, Babel moves in field now he's tackled and losing at the Viera, the error onto Wilter, Wilter down the far side Gerard tracking him back, Wilter cutting in field, gives it to Freddie Lumberg, 30 yards out no room for the shot there, tackled by Hamann and by Hoppea, ball breaks the Perez, edge of the penalty here, now running into the penalty area, Perez has the ball, Perez takes on Carragher, Carragher goes well, cuts his foot in and diverts it behind for a corner, that was very good play by Arsenal, particularly by Perez, switching from left to right but Carragher kept his feet, did extremely well there, he had to time that tackle absolutely perfectly, could easily be one of those where you miss the ball and get the player but he got the ball corner kick, it's all red behind Vastarbalt's goal, the Arsenal red as Perez takes the corner, right footed, chipped in headed away by Hoppea for Liverpool and dropping to Robert Perez again, Gerard comes out to meet him but Perez crosses the ball and again, dive by Omri towards the ball, didn't make contact, cleared by Liverpool, collected by Col, nice little spell this for Arsenal, back to Dixon, Dixon chips it towards Perez, Perez heads it onto the penalty area and the call from Vastarbalt to Hoppea says leave it to me, they looked at good ball really when it was played out there but it's very difficult to head on to get the ball towards your own play, small distance out wide, here's Antje for Liverpool, to the Liverpool captain, Hoppea and Neza Tahmar, we played nearly 10 minutes of the second half and a sun drenched card of the Millennium Stadium, Arsenal, Liverpool, back to Hoppea and Nomnof moving up front from Liverpool, Hoppea's pass to Schmitzer was awful and won by Grimondi and taken up by Freddie Lumberg, rolling down the right hand side, Hamann's back there to help out, Carragher, Lumberg still has the ball, Hamann gets in and wins it and then Lumberg falls in, that's a free kick. Yes and that's been typical of what's happened throughout a lot of this game, particularly in the last 20 minutes of the first half and in this early period of the second half where the player breaks from midfield and he's outnumbered, he's no chance of getting through there, Lumberg, a bit of frustration in the Angerway free kick, you can only imagine with the heat and the pace of the game and so on and because of the actual involvement with it being the FA final, you've got to think that there will be substitutions in this match. Besterbilt takes the free kick, he can see himself taking it on the giant screen behind Siemens Gould, headed away by Keown for Arsenal, to Perez and Perez on to Wilton, inside Liverpool territory now, on show close by, Wilton retreats and then that's a good little pass to Perez, Wilton's available on the left side but instead the ball is aimed at Ornry, divided away by Hopien and Liverpool can't do a tack, Schmitzer has got Orn and Heskey with him, oh good tackle by Vieira, excellent challenge, winning the ball off Schmitzer and now an exchange of passes between Vieira and Perez and it's taken off by Ornry, Wilton is furthest forward, Ornry cuts in field, back kills the ball to Vieira and now wide to the right to Lumberg, into Vieira again, pulls in a good place in the far side to Perez, Arsenal dominating the second half so far, to Ornry, 30 yards some goal, he's juggling the ball beautifully, now breaks to Perez, Perez into the penalty, Ornry's onside is he, it comes best of all he makes the save, half clear, clear off the line by Arsenal, don't player, it was Ornry who cleared it, as Ashley Cole scored a shot goal, it hit Ornry or even Henry, well it was a what a chance that was, the ball actually went, went past and Houpier was there too as well on the line, it was Hopien, not Ornry, yes, Houpier was the man on the goal line, he was the man who saved it but really will touch it and buried that, when the ball broke two in there after the Gumpfoss Festival then the three bound came over and the shot came in from Will Tad, I thought he should have buried it, he side-footed it, Houpier got back on the line and saved Liverpool, I think it was actually Cole by the way Jimmy, Cole, I got the clearance wrong, it's all right, one one, all that matters is it was cleared off the line, it was, I hope you, there's a foul by Murphy, free kick to Arsenal, they were definitely in the ascendancy at the moment, but when it goes to Ornry, Ornry tackled again and some mad challenges going in there and then the referee spot something, I don't know what the decision is, is it a foul on Hermann or a foul by Hermann, it's going to be a yellow card, is it, reaching into his right pocket and G. Mark Hermann's going to be the first club book in the 2001 Cup fight, yes he already had a word, he's over the foul on the half-way line earlier, anyway there he was, it's going to be a free kick, about 15 yards outside the box to the left, Arsenal at this moment and Ollins just told you they're in the ascendancy again, which is why McCallister's got to come on very shortly, he's spoken to at the moment by Gerard Hullier and he still hasn't got his goal shirt on but he will have soon, 13 minutes played in the second half, Arsenal nil, Liverpool nil, shot driven in, what a waste, what a waste from Thierry Omri, what was the point of that, it was a brave attempt, anyway there it goes, sorry brave what you're saying, I would have used the word stupid, from that range and that angle, he's got to be the clearance, but it's an amazing series of events really and the ball, when the ball actually went past Vestamel, it came to Cole and he got his left foot onto it and it was going in definitely about, no question about that and who here was the man on the line, got his left foot to it, just enough and Liverpool scrambled it away and they need to do something now and well that's the reason I think for McCallister, coming up and standing on the sideline, well that was surely followed by Babel and Pires but the referee way play on, Vieira, the Pires on the far side and the next time the ball goes dead, McCallister will be on, Vieira to Lumberg and Lumberg lifts it further forward but beyond Omri and out comes Vestamel, he gathers it, now who would you take off, I take off Murphy, who would you take off, yes well they can take out the Murphy Auschwitz because neither of them can get in the game as an attacking player at the present time but I think that's the possibility, Carragher onto Heskey midway inside the arc, Heskey holds off at him, Heskey runs in, and then it's played in towards Owen and I'll tell you what the referee might have given a free kick there, yes just a bit of a tug coming back, a bit better from Liverpool, Vieira onto Grimondi, Grimondi to the halfway line and Lumberg and maybe as the players are getting a little bit tired we're nearly an hour through this game and all this heat and it's going to open up a little bit and Grimondi, a stripper sheltered that ball to go behind, Grimondi within the silly challenge but here comes McCallister and I can't see in the light which number's being held up but it's got to be Murphy, it's going to change the formation I would have thought it would be made in, he has to leave the formation the way it is Jimmy, I wonder whether first when he might have put Gerrard out onto the right hand side bring McCallister and we've heard him but he hasn't done it, I thought he might have done that, no he hasn't changed the formation at all, no I just thought he might have given a little bit of mobility down the right hand side, there we go, well I'm surprised that Murphy's selection and amazed that he's being retained but maybe he'll score the winner for Liverpool, here's Babel on the far side his play resumes and McCallister has been the man of the last few weeks for Liverpool is on a substitute, on it goes to Owen, Owen spins but loses control of the ball in the same moment and moment and Cole clears over the halfway line, on show for Liverpool Murphy and Murphy hustled out of it, what a great ball but here's Arstow and it's four against three here, Omri must be offside against Perez, a very foolish play by Robert Perez, he can look along the line and the few people are in that Liverpool defence and it's silly being beyond them, well he just went a little bit too early there you know if he just held off, if he just held off that was a great opportunity because Liverpool lost possession on the halfway line, it wasn't a good ball that was played to Murphy and it broke down and if Perez had just stayed onside at four on three there they really had a great opportunity, some of my thoughts on what about McCallister you know saying they'll put Gerard now I think in a mom's role and I think sometimes you know if you if you sometimes put him out on the right he gets a bit more room I think sometimes to play free there we go, clearance upfield by Besterbilt, McCallister jumps, drops to Heskey, Heskey back to Carragher and Carragher on to Schmitzer and Schmitzer takes on Dixon Beatsom, Lumberg's back there and Lumberg with a food challenge on Schmitzer and that should be a yellow card yep he's got a book on deck coming yeah he's got a book out here Steve, already knows he knows he's pulled him back yeah because Schmitzer actually what he he ran across him as well which made it all the more difficult for Jürgen Berg, there we go, well a key influence and Lumberg pulls recent run of success has been McCallister's delivery from free kicks either directly on goal or in terms of a free kick like this which is wide on the left hand side Hope you mix the run to the near post, McCallister flicks it in and it's headed away by Grimondi out of play, throwing the Liverpool, sometimes it just takes him two or three minutes to get into the into the scenario just coming on as a substitute it's not easy, McCallister's throwing, Schmitzer runs for and he's done well, put your room down the left and as he crossed Grimondi's foot, he's divided it behind for a Liverpool form at the Liverpool fans end that's why you can hear a lot noise yeah so McCallister a bit of a man who was going to deliver this as well, all right well he put his left arm forward and I've watched Liverpool so much of late that usually means near post for Hope to head off, left arm aloft we'll see it is to the near post and then go serve your heads at home and headed away by Grimondi, great head away by Grimondi because he was a nice flick on by Hope, oh him was running behind him but Grimondi was there, you watch it Jim, two arms aloft means a deeper corner but what I can never understand is if I can see this why can't the opposition see it all the time anyway Schmitzer comes forward for Liverpool and Schmitzer again runs forward and leaves the ball behind him and Luebberg takes it clear for Arsenal Henri's on the half way line, Luebberg moves in field and then plays it back to Mark and Kiln, we played 18 and a half minutes of the second half and it remains Arsenal 0 Liverpool 0 and it's a brighter second half, Perez to Luebberg, do you think it's because they're towering a little bit? Yes well you were expecting you know one or two spaces starting to appear but if you if you look at the game basically and we've played an hour and over then very few shots at goal, very few, well we've only really had the two chances, one for Arsenal for Henri which he certainly should have scored and then the Heskey header in the second half which seemed insane, Cole, oh sorry I'm thinking about Cole that was another chance that was the best chance of the match for me, of course it was, hopefully off the line from Ashley Cole, it's forward for Liverpool to Ohan, Ohan controls it well holding off Kiln, plays it back to Gerard, Gerard now to Carragher and certainly of the two teams Liverpool would certainly not want extra time, not with the UEFA Cup final coming up in the Dortmund on Wednesday night, you'll hear the whole of that in five lines, good ball forward to Heskey, Heskey tries to flick it to Murphy, he didn't quite come off and a rampaging one by Packard, the error, ready made 50th on towards Wilton, good anticipation by Best of El, I do his penalty area and the clearance up fail and Cole has to be careful here, careful here, oh Cole is pulled back by Heskey according to the linesman and it's a free kick to Arsenal, well he's letting go Steve Dome because they've all fell for Cole in the end but didn't look too much trouble to me, here's the error again, the error pushing the Liverpool penalty into the Liverpool penalty area, Best of El out but Wilton runs the ball behind, that's going to be a goal kick, just slightly over it, though all that was a much better passenger player, the booring you can hear there is aimed at the referee for the supposed foul Heskey on Cole, I think Cole actually lost his bearings there, that's what I thought, I was a bit surprised at that position anyway, what's happening here, he can't change his boots, I think like that, come on, well he's letting him, that's exactly what's happening, I don't think Mr Dunl will worry about half time, about extra time if he hasn't got far to go, no, no, that Liverpool would want it, and Arsenal will take it if necessary and Mike might get him forecast it, interesting to go, he thought it was going to be an extra time, he wouldn't surprise me Alan, let's see that, unless he can get Smiths into the game soon, I would have thought you know we could have seen Berger really, I think if he doesn't get into it soon, well Berger, Berger has been limbering up for as long as Gary McAllister, Berger for Schmitz who would be the next natural change, clearance finally by Best of All, Adams heads it away and Schmitz heads it back to Carragher, Carragher right footed, hits it down the Liverpool left touchline, all kicks and slips and very unfortunately comes off his knee out of play for Liverpool Throne, he just was looking around to see if there were any Liverpool players in the vicinity, there weren't actually, but Liverpool are throwing, Carragher to take it and Carragher throws it back to Gerard, Gerard to Hoopia, Hoopia into Gerard again just left of the centre circle, Gerard looking to hit it crossfield towards Babel, good crossfield pass to Walsh too, to Marcus Babel who controls it, slips it in towards Gary McAllister just ahead of the scot and through it goes to David Seaman, the intention was very good, it was just slightly over hit there but Keown was completely in control there and to be fair he hasn't missed much in this match Keown, just that one incident where he lost out on the header and asked he got the header on and Seaman saying but he was there shielding that ball away, quick control by Omri, Omri's left on Schubert down and then it hits Hoopia, rebound to Lumber, Liverpool took the goal was Hoopia off the line again, dropping to Omri in the folly, played infield, on Schubert, hits it away and Hoopia clears, so twice off the line for Hoopia, yes he did very well he really did, you could see it coming though because the goalkeeper rushing out he made it very difficult for Leungberg and he tried to chip it so he read it and that's Heskey upfield but Adam's up too much nice, he finds Cole on it goes to Vieira, Arsenal are the better team at the moment but they haven't scored yet, led way through the second half of the cup final, here's Mike and still full of energy and full of running is Patrick Vieira, he's having a storming second half, I agree that it is a much better second half but on the balance now Jim, the team playing in red today should be in front, well they're on the balance, oh yes I would say they've been the better team, I don't think anybody inside the ground will dispute that, but you better get the ball in the back of the net and you know when it's lying this, Liverpool are quite capable of getting the first goal, well Ancho just manages to reach and get a foot in, the ball is still bouncing around inside the Liverpool half over on the far side, Heskey's kept it in and now Murphy immediately closed down by Pires and Ashleigh Cole, Murphy's still scrapping away but he's lost the ball and neat little turns from Will Taard manages to avoid the referee, finds Pires who's sitting in the centre of midfield, Pires tried to play in Dixon down the right hand side, the ball was too short and now Liverpool may be dangerous on the counter attack, Carragher floats it forward, Smits is there, Grimondi's back, Smits has got no support at all at the moment, Michael Owen arise behind him, Owen on the edge of the penalty area faced by Vieira and Grimondi, Owen still manages to retain possession, he's got Smits with him still on the left hand side, McAllister's now in the penalty area but Liverpool have to hold, they don't get the ball into the area, they knock it across square to Danny Murphy, Murphy now back again to Michael Owen down this left hand side, lovely first touch from Michael Owen, Owen against Dixon in the penalty area, Owen cuts in and then with his right foot drives it to the far post, almost missed at the far post by Arsenal, Badall nearly sneaked him down that right hand side, a poor herring clearance Arsenal long ball played in again by Danny Murphy, Dixon drops it, lets it drop, wants it to go over the line, it hasn't done yet so Dixon has to play it and eventually finds touch so suddenly a good retaliation by Liverpool but it's still Liverpool 0 Arsenal 0, this is five live and BBC World Service the cup final live from the Millennium Stadium, still waiting for a first goal in the first cup final outside England, thrown to be taken by Jamie Carragher, the referee's not happy something going on in the area involving Keown and Heskey, 20 minutes to go of normal time, remember we had a penalty shootout in the other cup final played in the stadium, the Lee cup final which Liverpool 1, throw by Carragher aimed towards Heskey, up in the air it goes and Heskey has a free header eventually it's Pires knocking it strongly out, Gerard knocks it back in it goes, Arsenal had pushed up and in the end Heskey was looking interested but the ball has gone away from him and it's a goal kick for Seaman, the ball came out to Gerard who's now playing in the Imam role really, he's just playing behind the the other midfield players coming up to join whenever he can, there was an opportunity about 30 yards out and he miscuted I think, he miscuted that ball I think he had a pop-up goal but it went across and it could have gone anywhere but he didn't fall to a Liverpool player David Seaman's clearance and that's gone out of player on the far side, the last time that Arsenal played in FA Cup time Wales I was there and they lost to Rexon under George Graham of course and the game continues over on the far side and a good stretch by Ashleigh Cole, no sign yet that Arsenal Venger's going to make a change yet, Ray Parler possibly to come on soon for maybe for Freddie Lungberg so that might be the first Arsenal change, Liverpool have brought on McAllister in the second half of her man, now Martin Keown with a good, Emile Heskey's got a bang on the head they're having a bit of a set two at the moment those two, clearance by Seaman and now Arsenal bringing it out of defense with Grimond, he can't go forward back again to Keown who'll be hoping of course to be named in Sven Joran Ericsson's England squad for the World Cup game in Greece also the friendly with Mexico, Arsenal lose their way and Liverpool have had a better last three or four minutes, it's Jamie Carragher thought about going forward in the end gives it back to his keeper away to our right Sander Vestervoet, Liverpool near Arsenal 0, Vestervoet's ball is kept in over on the far side by Babel in the sunshine, Babel back again to Vestervoet and Vestervoet's clearance that could have gone anywhere that was a real Daisy cutter and it's back again, it's put his team under pressure, Robert Pires now for Arsenal charging forward, Lungberg's there, goes for the goalkeeper and scores for Arsenal and it all came about as a result of that very poor clearance from Sander Vestervoet, Liverpool have been punished, Freddie Lungberg who I thought might be about to be replaced here by Ray Parla but the man from Sweden with the red streak in his hair has gone round Vestervoet and he's broken the deadlock here in the Cup final, it's Arsenal 1 Liverpool 0, yeah so I think in the end it was one of two things really that brought it about but in the close it was a clearance first of all out from the goalkeeper but there was a nice feed back in and I must give Lungberg credit there, he showed a bit of pace and when it came on he whipped it out to the left hand side and I thought it just for a second gone too far but he's banged it into the back of the net, good goal by Lungberg and I think Arsenal you know on the balance of play really, I've shared it definitely Liverpool have 17 and a half minutes to respond here, Arsenal go in front, 1-0 they lead, Freddie Lungberg and they had been the likely scorers but now Arsenal have to concentrate and Adams will do that and gets in against Michael Owen and now Gerard Houdier might be wondering whether to make another change, maybe sooner or later Robbie Fowler but the word was that Parla could well be coming on and I thought that Lungberg was the most likely person to come off but he's now scored, the man from Sweden who normally does well of course playing for Sweden against England, it's 1-0 to Arsenal, ball played in by Gerard headed away by Keown and of course now Liverpool have to penetrate this excellent Arsenal defence, long one now from Lungberg looking for Will Taard over on the far side and on show clears into the crowd over on the far side, 20-year old game football, you know Parla was that you know he was all ready to come on and Lungberg has got the goal, Parla still stood there wondering whether there's opportunity, well he's going to come or whether he's gone, just talking to Steve Stiefold here just before I picked up the commentary he thought that the first change would be Parla for Lungberg and they appear to be about to make that change when Lungberg scored, took it well, went round the goalkeeper and the way that Henri should have done in the first half, now Smitzer though for Liverpool, ever dangerous, the ball played into Waltheski but they'll have to do better than that, Adams gets in and releases Lungberg now down the right hand side that's a glorious fall into Henri with only one defender back, Henri goes through could score, great save for Vestermelt, Henri again complete miss kick and it'll be clear off the line by up here and Henri should have scored second time round, initially a great save from Vestermelt, wonderful ball by Lungberg, when it came back to Henri it should have been too no, what a chance that was really, but the game's opened up now, but really that could have finished it really, the describe of Dominique has been Liverpool are coming forward with Babel down the right hand side, that really could and should have been the second and that should have been you would have thought with 16 minutes to go enough to win the cup, but it's 1-0 to Arsenal, 1-0 to the Arsenal, how many times do we hear that over the years? I wouldn't have thought that whoofie had kicked the ball off Liverpool's line three times in one match would he? Gary McAllister now down the centre looking for Danny Murphy who made the run and Murphy's fallen awkwardly with Martin Keown inside the penalty area, Murphy's on his back, Keown is on his back as well and on for the first time really in the game come the two physios and it's a chance for you Jen just to the situation. Well I mean say Henri there what he did, he actually went round Vestermelt, the most lovely ball through from Lungberg, but when it came back to him the second time it looked to me as though he miscued it, he miscued the ball and really should have stuck it in the back of the net, it was a wonderful chance, it was a better chance than the one that Colad before that was played off the line and hope he was there again just to pick the ball up and the same Mike three times now whoofie off Liverpool's line. Well while the treatment is still being given to the injured players we are going to get a change from Arsenal over on the far side and looks like Will Tord is going off now, Sylvan Will Tord having just gone in front, Ray Parler is coming on and I'm not sure whether that would have been the initial plan but maybe Arsenal now having gone in front Jim are thinking of really closing it down now. Well they've looked pretty close you know the back to me as it is you know they're not giving much away and he's done well Will Tord I think he's a busy little lad he's put himself around a bit he's tried to give support whatever possible you know I think he's done very well he's worked hard so there's a pair of fresh legs as much as anything, Parler's come out to the right Lungberg now will go further up you know he'll get a free reign round to run around and I don't think he's going to take Grimondi off I thought he might have been impossible he's done well well Pat he's done a good job, Berger and Fowler are both going to come on for Liverpool so it could still be Robbie Fowler's day Patrick Berger is coming on Danny Murphy's gone off we also think that Kahnu might come on soon for Arsenal as well because he's been called as well by Arson Wenger so Patrick Berger is coming on for Murphy and who is Fowler coming on for we're just waiting to see Robbie Fowler the Liverpool captain will come on for Vladimir Smith sir so that's they are the last changes of course that Gerard Hullier can make, McAllister, Fowler and Berger great response great reaction now from the crowd as Robbie Fowler who of course scored a fantastic goal here in the Worthington Cup final he comes on and so Liverpool really going for it now with Heskey Fowler and Owen Heskey's gone out to the right side now Berger on the left and Fowler will be up front alongside Owen so we'll see when other things can get much more support to the front players because so far they've had very very little really to trouble I think anyway or they could have troubled them but I think strength due to Arson's strength at the back Adams Keown very very strong indeed well Thierry Henry could have put this game beyond Liverpool here is Mr. Couple of great chances Freddie Lungberg though has scored the goal and it's Arsenal won Liverpool 0 Liverpool have had the upper hand in all the domestic games in the last five years but when it comes to the big one Arsenal again have risen to the occasion long one now from Martin Keown and honoree is given offside and that's a free kick to Liverpool so here in Cardiff the red dragons today are Arsenal so far they're wearing the red and they lead by one goal to nil and overall they deserve to have that lead and Freddie Lungberg now is fouled by Gerard on the halfway line. Thierry is shaped to take the kick quickly but nobody really ready for it and now Arsenal clearly will try and use up a little bit of time as well they've got a free kick. You know a song this award is singing Arsenal one nil to the Arsenal they had a gang of them singing that when I was coming in. And remember this is the only trophy that Arsenal can win this season unlike Liverpool still going to be way for cup on Wednesday this is five live and BBC World Service live from Cardiff we've got 12 minutes to go in the cup final and Arsenal have gone in front here through Freddie Lungberg initially a mistake by Vestervoet very poor clearance by the goalkeeper and Liverpool never really came to terms with it and eventually excellent little ball through to Lungberg who went round Vestervoet and finished well. honoree since then has missed a great chance to make it 2-0. Ball is inside the centre circle. Hopia. Hopia now to Babel. Babel's though veering back towards his own goalkeeper gives it back again to Hopia. Liverpool have just brought on Fowler and Berger. Ball now is flicked on by Michael Owen but Keown is there Keown and Adams haven't really missed a great deal at the back issues. Water day for Arsenal. Arsenal's ball straight back again though to the men in the goal of Liverpool. Gary McAllister short of the halfway line plays the ball through honoree's legs finds on show and now on to Stephen Geron nothing like as effective in the last half an hour or so in this final Stephen Geron. Vestervoet now running the ball out of the penalty area. Vestervoet clears long down the far side. Heskey will jump with Ashley Colombriss will easily win the ball but great challenge by Keown on Michael Owen and now Vieira. Vieira faced by McAllister. Ball into Perez and Perez has completely lost that and it's a throat in Liverpool over on the far side he just seemed to take his eye off it. No I let it go through his legs I think you thought there was another player coming behind him. Babel back to the halfway line to find Ancho. Ancho will just knock it across the centre of his defence and find Pupier who's now been relieved to the captaincy now that Fowler's come on. Fowler inside the centre circle back again to Geron down the centre from Geron. Owen away from the defender. Owen in the area cross comes Keown and the big defender Keown did so well there. Closing down Michael Owen before he could untangle his legs and get a shotting goal and now Ray Parler going forward for the first time but can't get it through to Arnary and tidying up his Ancho and Liverpool almost cut through. There's a great challenge. Terrific challenge really because Owen was inside the penalty spot there going at goal and Keown was quite a pacey player. You know he did very well because he got his body in there won the ball you know and he pushed Owen away with it at the same time. Terrific challenge that was. The last 10 minutes of the Cup final Arsenal won Liverpool 0. Freddy Lungberg has scored. Gary McAllister now wasted. Income Arsenal with a need interception. Martin Keown has just saved the day. Keown checks and then hits it down the centre. There's only Anri downfield now. Wiltor's been taken off. Anri with a good little ball to Lungberg. He's got Parler on the outside and Lungberg goes for glory and hits it 10 yards wide into the Arsenal fans behind Vestival's goal. The goal's gone to his head a little bit and I think that was a bit adventurous there but because he had Parler coming up on the right hand side but he's already found the back of the net. He's after another one. It was Miles off target there but so that challenge of Keown's I'm just going to say as well. I don't think Owen's first touch really you know did him any favours and Keown did well. Just got a ball away. Well we told you before the game that Arsenal normally win the FA Cup the year after Chelsea and at the moment they're on course to do that again. They lead here by one goal to know but still a lot of work to do. Still eight minutes for Liverpool to get back in the game. Anything could happen yet. Ball down this near side. Jamie Kerrigan and he's well advanced inside the Arsenal half. Parler is holding him up and he's holding him up illegally. It's a free kick to Liverpool. Gary McAllister time. Once more down this left hand side. McAllister to make the free kick. Hopier obviously to go forward. Heskey will be dangerous and McAllister gets the ball and it's about five yards in from the near touch line down this near side. This is the right hand side, the left hand side, the field. Babble's in the penalty area too and it goes and it's headed up in the air by Martin Keown. It's still only six yards out. Babble's there and McAllister is there and it goes from Michael Aime. Seven yards out and brilliant finish by the England striker. Sustaining his marvellous run just recently. Three goals against Newcastle, two against Chelsea and in his very first cup final he's made it here. Arsenal won Liverpool won a brilliant, typical finish from Michael Aime. Well it's amazing how it goes. It's probably the only way that Liverpool's looked at all the good of score to me is off a dead ball situation. The ball was knocked in. Keown headed it up in the air and he went up in the air. I think it was Babble who got the next touch and he knocked it down and Aime was the player who reacted first. Give him credit, put the ball in the back of the net. Well Karnu is going to come on soon for Arsenal. I said anything could happen yet in this game. Another Gary McAllister free kickers down the trick and now Arsenal have to clear and they haven't cleared it too well. Burger is there. It's it's straight up Martin Keown and Liverpool win a corner and the whole atmosphere in the Millennium Stadium now has transformed. One-one and we've got six and a half minutes to go. It's going to be a Gary McAllister corner kick down this near side. Alan was saying that one hand normally means near post, two hands normally means far post and at the moment it's the one arm that's been raised and Babble is there once more. All sorts of problems and it's one arm. This presumably will go towards Huppier at the near post. David Seaman raises both arms and it goes towards the near post. It's more into the centre of the goal this time. Keown clears, Burger pounces, excellent ball back to McAllister who hit it instinctively across the six yard area. Hit it too strongly though and it's going to be a goal kick to be taken by David Seaman. Well what a situation. Johnston two, Dundee United three now in Scotland and we wait now for Karnu to come on for Arsenal and Freddie Lungberg having scored the goal. I have to say I think he was coming off originally and then he scored and Ray Parler then came on for Wilton as Arsenal and Banger looked to try and really make things solid out there but now Arsenal need another goal of course and Karnu has come on to Lungberg. There's a difference of goal may say. Some of them was a spring in Liverpool's step. Public ball from Burger out to McAllister just a moment ago and he whipped it across naturally. Well anything can happen now Mike. Well it's all happened in this game in the last 10, 15 minutes and now Pyrrhus down the left hand side and my word what will Thierry Henry be thinking now he's missed a couple of really great chances here for Arsenal today. It's now Arsenal won Liverpool won on five live and BBC World Service in the cup final. Karnu gets his first touch for those long legs Karnu but McAllister's too sharp for him and McAllister's going to win the ball against Karnu. Great play by the Scott. McAllister on to Robbie Fowler. Fowler's moving he's got owing down the left hand side but he was a little selfish actually ran forward with the ball inevitably lost it and as the game opens up once more the Ayrus switches it down the left hand side a fantastic ball. Henry took it on the chest he's going to run up Marcos Babel. Henry's all on his own in the penalty area and all he could do there was to shoot and Vestervelt made the save from the angle. This time a better distribution from Vestervelt. Ingo the challenges once more much much better second half the goals of course always change games it's one one and it's now Jamie Carragher edge of the penalty area giving it back to Sammy Huppier. Hardly time to draw breath here. Arsenal now being examined by Liverpool. Berger on to Fowler. Fowler's got owing again on his left hand side goes past Adams cross comes Ashley Cole and Cole just manages to get enough on the ball back to David Siemens. Siemens quick clearance downfield. Henry was offside but the referee Stephen Dunl will let the game carry on and the atmosphere responding now to the goals which have been scored belatedly in this final it was a very poor first half very unadventurous but it's quite exciting now one one Heskey over on that right hand side Heskey back to his defenders Stephen Gerrard who's playing just in front of the back four at the moment finds Sammy Huppier on the left of the Liverpool defence and now Carragher short of the half-way line only three and a half minutes to go plus whatever time will be added on at least a couple of minutes will be added on because we have had stoppages in this second half Liverpool just having a little bit of a breather here the support though coming in now from the Liverpool fans all around us particularly and especially away to the left where Liverpool have scored their equaliser through Michael Owen it's now Heskey down the right hand side halfway inside the Arsenal half McAllister on towards Berger Berger tried to release Marcus Babel but it was too top heavy and it's a goal kick well I think for the first time now I suppose perhaps from the early part of the game the Liverpool fans think they come in the cup here because you know they were out to it for a large section of the game and really Arsenal should have put it out inside but they haven't done that Liverpool have got back in good goal by Owen I thought it was too I just wonder what really Arsenal Venger's thinking about his substitution with Wiltrow coming off from Farleague going down you know when they were winning surprising really are we all seeing the game differently well Arsenal Venger has still got one more trick up his sleeve if he wants to he can still make another change he's still got Dennis Burkamp of course on the bench or he's still got Lauren as well and we're just seeing arson Venger actually coming into that technical area over on the far side but we've got two and a half minutes to go Arsenal won Liverpool won in the cup final and Arsenal have a free kick just inside the Liverpool half to the left as we look at it over on the far side Robert Pires takes it with his right foot towards Canu well cleared by Emil Heskey and now Berger with the long hair scoops the clearance forward looks for the pace of Owen Dixon's out of position Owen goes into the area angles all good what a goal from Michael Owen Michael Owen takes out Dixon Adams and Seaman and celebrates in front of the Liverpool fans Michael Owen is hot he's had a remarkable last week that is a great goal by any stretch of the imagination Liverpool were defending Berger's long ball he looked to Owen to provide the pace the penetration and he was there when it mattered and Liverpool have come from behind here stupendously through Michael Owen to lead by two goals to one well I've got to say that Liverpool probably think they could win the cup but really it was a fantastic fantastic finish by Owen I think Seaman should have covered his angle better but the ball came over from Berger was a good ball and what happened was it was Owen's pace that got him past Dixon and he finished it beautifully we were right behind it it just crept inside the post just inside the left hand post and I just say I was just saying you know Mike Liverpool probably the first time I actually feel they can win the cup with that goal it's amazing that first goal has changed everything and I think Arsenal have lost a little bit since they changed the formation it was a finish of the highest quality and we're in the last minute of normal time Michael Owen who really has come again in the last week or so and now I think Dennis Burkamp's gonna come on over on the far side but Owen has scored he's now scored 23 this season and Sven Joran Erickson who's in the stadium would have been so so delighted to see that from one of his main men in the side great finish from the angle from Michael Owen it all came about initially after Pirras had taken a free kick for Arsenal Liverpool were backpedalling they got it clear and then look to the pace of Michael Owen Dennis Burkamp now is going to come on for Lee Dixon and we have 10 seconds of normal time to go and the game has been turned on its head here in his very first cup final by Michael Owen Michael Owen who was left out of the Worthington Cup final line up here against Birmingham City and what will we be telling you before the game about so names winning these games who could so easily be Christian names of course well Owen was one of them and Owen has scored the two goals that look like they're gonna count unless Arsenal can come back header comes in from Martin Keough but Vestervoet was there and his mistake now which led to the first Arsenal goal three minutes of added time doesn't look like it's going to be costly but what about those misses from Thierry Henri now two really good chances that he squandered which could have made all the difference yes it's it's amazing you know our football quite often can repeat itself Michael over a period of time I've seen games like this many a time Arsenal look through about it one even but one meal anything could happen and Liverpool got the cells back in the game and then suddenly they get on the upswing and here they are now a couple of minutes off lifting the FA cup three minutes of added time two French managers we're playing this cup final outside England but the goals the crucial goals have been scored by an Englishman Michael Owen Liverpool lead to one Arsenal have to do it quickly Burkamp is there and Gerald Clare's two minutes to go two minutes of added time Liverpool's clearance goes straight to Ashley Cole incomes across from Cole Adams has stayed forward Burkamp on the edge of his area a little too slow to react incomes Grimondi Pires to pick up the loose ball Pires ball in will be headed away by Stefan Ancho just under two minutes to go about it time Liverpool have turned it round Michael Owens turned it round and now Arsenal are terribly caught and Fowler can get through to O'Hara it could be a hat trick but Fowler can't get past Martin Keown otherwise Michael Owen could have been through for the first hat trick in the cup final since Stanley Mortensen and Arsenal Clare but they have to do this very very quickly it's all gone wrong for them in goes the ball from Ray Parler and it's going to miss out Tarnu great roar from the Liverpool fans all around us and they are now just seconds away from their first FA Cup triumph for what will be nine years well it could have been a third goal for Liverpool there Arsenal had committed themselves forward and really foul the lost control of the ball it didn't look a very difficult ball to control and knock on to Michael Owen but he tried to get his left foot on it coming from the right and lost control all the qualities that Owen showed of course in the World Cup and the Glen Hoddle that great goal in San Hedyen against Argentina all those qualities again shown when he scored that second goal it didn't look to be on in fact it wouldn't have been on for most strikers in the game but Owen went through down this left hand side taking out Dixon and Adams and from the angle finished past David Seaman we've got seconds to go here in the Millennium Stadium Michael Owen is the Millennium man Liverpool lead by two goals to one and Arsenal are caught out and this time Fowler can't find Owen Fowler shoots weakly straight at David Seaman easy save that could have been the end of it and it looked off side to me and Arsenal committing suddenly players forward were completely caught out the whistle goes the game has been won by Liverpool Michael Owen punches the air all the cameramen make their way towards him Patrick Berger gives the little man a great big hug and Liverpool have won the cup they've come back from the dead here to win by two goals to one Michael Owen the hero and everybody's running towards him to show him and tell him exactly what they think of him great finishing by great striker Liverpool have now won two cup finals they will go on to Dortmund to try and complete the hat trick on Wednesday night it was amazing football it can be very cruel at times and it can be very uplifting when you win it it's been a very cruel cup final for Arsenal who really must have thought they had this this this cup one with about eight or nine minutes left but they've had two goals hit against them one of them a very good goal I thought but you know and Liverpool in the end have stuck on and stuck on and got it through but really Liverpool have the chances to have won it before that oins cup final Michael Owen two goals again you can't take that fact away from him wonderful but don't forget who p.a three clearances off his own line how many players have been letting a cup final well the last time that these two clubs met in a cup final that was at Wembley in the league cup when Arsenal came from behind with two goals from Charlie Nicholas to beat Liverpool by two goals to one the boot was very much on the other foot here today and Liverpool had to change their strip of course they were trying to become the first team to win the cup playing in their second strip since Tottenham back in 1982 they've done that but more importantly they shown great spirit great togetherness and some really really clinical sharp shooting from Michael Owen during yes they have a bit of self-belief there for them as well it went for them once or twice you've got to give them credit they stuck at it and I think they look better actually once they've got Gary McAllister onto the field because what he does he starts to thread the ball through a little bit better than that but prior to that I thought they defenced it extremely well and in saying that so too did Adams and Keoghler we're outstanding really for most of the game meanwhile in the other half it's the usual scene here Arsenal can't believe it most of their players have just been sitting on the ground some of them just lying completely for lawn Thierry Henri I wonder what's going through his mind he knows he will know that he's missed a couple of great chances here for Arsenal who will now end the season in terms of trophies of course empty-handed Liverpool are about to get their hands on the FA cup in a few moments time it is now being engraved of course the name of Liverpool is being engraved on the cup in the meantime here's Mark and they're just building that presentation platform from which Liverpool will receive the FA cup shortly we'll be back with Mike let's go down onto the pitch though Steve Wilson's been with the Liverpool team today Steve absolute bedlam in this half of the field I mean 15,000 of these Liverpool fans are going to go straight from Cardiff to Dortmund I would think it's barely worth going back north to Merseyside they must have thought that they weren't going to win it Gerard Hulier is absolutely beaming from ear to ear he's caked in sweat I think he's been through everything this afternoon meanwhile on the pitch I mean the players who weren't involved the players who didn't even get out of their suits look like they are as ecstatic as even Michael Owen who scored the two winning goals of course which I think says something about the team spirit which Gerard Hulier has instilled in this Liverpool side Jamie Carragher is standing with his hands on his hips he's looking down at the turf I think he's just trying to capture this moment put it in a mental bottle in the back of his mind and say I want to remember this for the rest of my life this wasn't a great cup final but what a fantastic finish for Liverpool they must mark the thought that they'd lost it indeed I suppose it reminds us of a 79 cup final in a way that for so much of the game it wasn't very exciting but an extraordinary day no more there has to be a loser Thierry Omri looks absolutely inconsolable Nick Mullins it's always the awful contrast isn't it Mark and my eyes were on Tony Adams during those final few seconds and for about 10 seconds immediately afterwards he was just lying flat on his back doubtless wondering if he would ever be on this stage again remember he said that next season will be the last season that will do for him thank you very much 10 seconds thinking about himself and then after 10 seconds he got back onto his feet and suddenly realized that there was some opposition to congratulate and Tony Adams led the Arsenal players over to the Liverpool players shaking every one of them by the hands Adams had done his job and then he walked back to his own team and made sure that no one was feeling too sorry for themselves he's up now Adams he's there he's got a rueful smile on his face the other person I was watching was Freddie Leomberg who eight minutes before full time was probably thinking that he was about to be an FA Cup winner and the reason that Arsenal had won the FA Cup he just nipped back down into the dressing room for a couple of seconds to gather his thoughts it's a very very difficult situation for everyone but Tony Adams and Freddie Leomberg just kind of encapsulating what 30 000 Arsenal fans away to my left are thinking at the moment arms crossed wondering what's happened well what an astonishing win for Liverpool in the FA Cup final we'll bring you the presentation from the Millennium's a couple of other important results today Bayern Munich have gone three points clear in the Bundesliga they beat Kaiserslautern 2-1 today and Scholker their main rivals for the title were beaten 1-0 at Stuttgart and in Italy's Serie A Roma stay five points clear at the top they beat to Atalanta by a goal to nil today it's 16 hours Greenwich meantime this is Martin Fuchs in London you're listening to Sports World on the BBC World Service this violent up-surgery fighting
