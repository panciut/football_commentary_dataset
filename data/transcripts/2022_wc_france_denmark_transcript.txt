 Damsegaard of Brentford on the left and Andreas Cornelius up front. The countdown is over, the match begins. It is France against Denmark, five live and BBC sounds. And the ball is immediately out of play for a throw-in to Denmark over on the far side of the field. That is the Danish right. They're playing from right to left as we look in this first half from high up on the dugout side of the ground. And he has Mala, the left wing back. Denmark tonight, white shirts, red shorts and white socks. And remember Denmark drew their first match, 0-0 against Tunisia, one of the, as we discussed last night, five 0-0 draws that have been so far at this world cup. But the situation in the group now, after Australia's win earlier in the first match of the day, Australia now in second place in the group. So France with three points, Australia with three points, Denmark with one and Tunisia with one and seemingly on the brink of being knocked out. Their final match is against the world champions, France. So good luck with that Tunisia. But Denmark, coming through the middle, good possession from them in the early stages. Ball played out towards the left-hand side here. But across comes Dembele and France and the very dark blue shirts that they're wearing at this world cup. Try to come forward, white shorts, red socks. But the pass was over-hipped from Kunde at right back and it's out of play for a throw-in to Denmark. Just about halfway inside the French half. Kunde, who is playing at right back, preferred to Paver, even though he scored, he also committed the mistake that led to the Australian goal. And it is Denmark with it on the right-hand side. Here's Christensen of Leeds, wins a throw-in of Theo Hernandez and takes it back towards the halfway line. And then it comes all the way back to Christensen in the middle of the back three. And then to the left, Victor Nelson, who's coming to the back line. Blunted figure, as I said, Galatasaray defender. He plays it forward to Mela. And then Mela goes all the way back to Schmeichel, away in the goal to our right. Just looking at the position of Griezmann in that French midfielder. He's going to have to do, I think, a little bit extra tonight, alongside Tieu-Ameny and Rabiot on that midfield. Otherwise, France might find themselves outnumbered at times. It is Denmark still in possession. It's a really good confidence start from Denmark, ranked number 10 in the world. Certainly one of the best European sides around. They've been excellent under Kasper Kuhlman, semi-finalists, of course, at the Euros last year. Ball played through the middle and that's a foul. And it is a free kick for the challenger, Lynne Ström. So a free kick and a good position, Alan. Yeah, I mean, we've only had two and a half minutes gone, John, but it's all been Denmark. They're just playing themselves into the game and getting plenty of touches. And no pressure on them as yet from France. Yeah, just the start they'll have wanted. Tieu-Ameny conceded that free kick. It's played short, Mélat right-footed ball in from the left flank, but that is headed up in the way. It was Olivier Giroud back inside his own penalty area. He looks terrific, doesn't he, Giroud? Those two goals in the opening match. I mean, a striker can't ask for too much more than that from your first game at a tournament. He'll be desperate to get that record tonight, when he's on his own, not sharing it with Thierry Henry. He'll want that on his own. Here is Dembele now, down the right-hand side for France. Plays it across to Rabiol. Now here is Mbappe into the match for the first time. Just listen to the frisson of excitement as Mbappe takes possession of the ball. However, he lost it. And Denmark are able to bring it forward again in center field. And it is Damsegaard who turns away. And then the ball is played through the middle for Cornelius, who was slightly behind him, and he just tried to check himself and knock it into his stride, but missed it completely. Very good play from Olivier. That was John, wasn't it, when he was left with one-on-one with Mbappe, and he tried the old leg over the ball, didn't he, as if he wanted him to go one-way, but he wasn't having any of that. He just got his body in the way and then set Denmark on the attack. You know what I like about Denmark? We've seen quite a lot of them. You know, they've played England on a number of occasions over the course of recent years. They are a proper team. They're a proper international football team. And even on, yes, they've got stars out there. I mean, here's one of them, for example, Christian Ericsson, who just plays the ball back into the centre circle. But they've clearly got a really good thing going under Caspar Hulmann, who seems to be someone who's very, very well suited to international football management as well. It breaks down on the edge of the French penalty area, and it's taken out to the far side by Thael Hernandez, who tries to play it out off the Danish player, but fails to do so, so it's a throw-in to Denmark near the corner flag into the box. Oh, nice glancing header. Cornelius plays it right across the penalty area, but doesn't get that right. And France will bring it away unless Mell has ever to challenge Dembele, but he can't. He was just through fleet of foot for Dembele, and then he also takes on and beats Ericsson and plays it to the left-hand side to Rabiot, and now to the left-hand side, and Mbappe is beginning to move infield. He plays it to Dembele on the edge of the D, turns under his right foot and shoots, but there was a man there for Denmark who was able to block it away. Christian Ericsson it was, and Denmark have got it again on the edge of the penalty area. I think I can count tonight who the neutrals inside the stadium are supporting. Everyone loves a winner. Absolutely, yeah, you can feel the anticipation when Dembele and Mbappe gets the ball, don't you? But I was really impressed at the numbers that Denmark had back then. Every single one of them doing their job, and there was no space whatsoever for Dembele to run into. France, Nill, Denmark, Nill. Five minutes played, and Denmark again to the halfway line, trying to start a Mexican wave already over on the far side of the field. Shall we get up, John? And honestly, Arlene, I've got so much on the plate that this will come. I haven't got time for Mexican waves. It's nothing to do with your bad knees then. My knees are all right. Mine aren't. No, here's Christensen, and then to Nelson to the left. And then it's played forward by Jamsgaard, and now shuffled forward by Ericsson, who tries to roll it across into the path of Cornelius, but up on the corner came across and just leaned into Cornelius, and so France have got it on the edge of their own penalty area. And that's exactly what I was talking about in terms of the Griezmann, who's going to pick that midfield runner. This time it was Ericsson, he'd no-one run with him at all. He ran free up until about 25 yards out, and you can't allow that too many times with his ability. France bring the ball forward. It's an interesting choice tonight, Cornelius, the big man, six-foot-four, he's now back in Denmark, playing for FC Copenhagen, his former team, having been in Turkey where he did well when the league with Trabs on Spore last season, but he has actually not scored since he went back to Copenhagen for this season. So I guess he's going to act as the target man through the middle, and they'll look to get as many bodies into the penalty area to support him. But is France in possession at the moment, and the cheer is because that Mexican wave continues to make its way around the ground. We will have real maximum-convaved in four years' time when the World Cup has been hosted in Mexico and Canada and the United States. He has unbappé on the left-hand side, good work from Christensen. They went shoulder-to-shoulder, the two of them together, and it was the lead United man who was able to get down, put the challenge in and put it out of play on the far side. Twice he's had the ball, two opportunities to run at them, and twice he's been taken care of with ease, actually he used all that professionalism, stood in front of him and said, you're going nowhere. I've rather liked Christensen actually, when I've seen him for lead United this season. He has done belly back to Rabiola, his head tied back behind his head, and Baba has got space out on the far side, but he has to back away and take it down, and then unbappé plays it in, whipped delivery. Christensen actually didn't get there by the time unbappé had got under control. He was almost on the white line on the far side, and then went for that vicious delivery into the penalty area. The Denmark were able to head away. He was absolutely vibrant, wasn't he, when it came to the latter stages of the game against Australia? That's the problem you've got, they've gone tight on him, and they've took the ball off, and they stood up from this time, and he whipped that ball in with a bit of pace, looking for the height of Giroud, but Denmark just clear at just some time. France nailed Denmark, nailed. Really good to see Raphael Vuran down there, because it looked as though for all the world, that when he went down with that injury at Stamford Bridge, just a few weeks ago now, that there would be no world cup for him, but fortunately, it turned out to be not as serious as he initially thought, and here he is now, starting for France in the second match, so Ibrahim Kanate of Liverpool is back on the bench for this one. Nel-Nel the score, and France making ground through the middle, out towards the left-hand side, and Bapé looks to give it back down the left-hand side, Hernandez with a cross, deep on towards the far post, almost false for Giroud, it was knotted back across by Rabiot, but it wouldn't come down for him, actually it bounced up and bounced across him, before he could get the shot in. Very good play from France down that left-hand side, Hernandez shows pace, he whipped the great ball in, and Rabiot gets on the end of it and tries to knock it back into Giroud, but again, Denmark had the numbers back there to clear it. Yeah, great work from Rabiot to get himself into the penalty area at the back post. Very similar run to what he got his goal the other night. Almost 10 minutes played, and it is Nel-Nel, the Danish fans just gently bobbing up and down together, it's like the last night of the proms over there, as the ball is played by Mael at back into centerfield, Ericsson goes for a long pass out to Christensen, who's into the penalty area, rolls the ball over, it rolls the foot over the ball, then it played into the area and it was blocked away, and it hit the corner flag and it hasn't gone out, it stayed in the quadrant, so two players have to race full tilt, Denmark have got it, he has the cross, but Loris is able to come and catch it, arms high above his head, on the edge of the six-yard box. Very good goalkeeping, just what your central defenders need, when that ball's in there and you look as if and feel as if they're in trouble, you're looking for the goalkeeper to come and give you a little bit of a hand. Well, he's had his moments, hasn't he, this season, Loris, but in amongst all that, he'll make some amazing saves, and he's been such an important man in this French side, as the captain and the lead at, and Will Cuppen in captain, obviously, but Nations League, when in captain as well, and you are remembering, absolutely brilliant in that Nations League final, and tonight it is 141st tap for France, which means he's won behind the record holder, Lillian Turan, I'm guessing you probably played against, yeah, what a good play he was. That was superb, he was, not a bad record, is it? No, it's not, and Will Cuppen are in all that in his son, of course, on the bench, coming on the other night, as Denmark play the ball away towards the halfway line, that's taken down by Huber McCarno, he knocks it forward, he has, Griezmann's not really got into the game just yet, and there's a foul on Mbappe, and it's a free kick to France over on the far side, I mentioned the fact that the Forest Green-Alva Church matches is going on on Sport Extra, the commentary, more news from there, with Chris Coles. An equaliser for the non-League side, John, Forest Green-1, Alva Church-1, Jed Abbey with a sumptuous free kick from the edge of the area over the wall, into the top corner, and the lowest ranked team left in the FA Cup are still alive. Forest Green-1, Alva Church-1, five minutes into the second half. Griezmann with this free kick for France, that's a good delivery as well, and it's come off the head of the defender, who just came across it and got a glancing head, it was Cornelius actually, the centre-forward, who actually headed it across his own penalty area, you had to get that right, but he did out for corner. There's a good ball in, Giri was lurking there, didn't he? Stretching his neck out there, the expectation that ball was going to get to him, so Cornelius had to get something on it, and luckily he did, but he's given away a corner. Well, if France continue to put balls into the Danish box like this, as they have done in the opening 12 minutes, this is going to be a severe test for the Danish defence. Corner then from the right, first corner of the match, Griezmann to take it, left for it, to the edge of the six yard box, glanced right across the face of goal, and then scrambled away at the back post, the number of players went for it at the near post, it might have been Varan who was closest to it, let's see, as the ball is cleared away downfield to Loris at the other end, long, long clearance from him downfield, Dembele wins that header, in fact he's fouled his man, Nelson, Victor Nelson who's gone down holding his head, so the referee, who actually I haven't mentioned yet, Simon Marciniak is the referee, the Polish official, Champions League referee, as you'll be aware, it was Varan, wasn't it, who got that near post header? It was a fantastic leap, wasn't it, at that near post there, when Griezmann whips that corner in with great pace again, and he's first to react and get that, but luckily for Denmark, Maylor was there at the far post to get it away. Yes, just making a look at that, so Varan's header, that's the nearest we've come to an opening goal in this World Cup match, in Group D, where if France win, they'll be through to the last 16, we're going back to the new long though, in the FA Cup, Chris Coles. Because Alba Church's joy short lived, Forest Green back in front, they lead to one, Josh March, stooping header at the back post, formerly of Alba Church, and he's put Forest Green two on up against Alba Church. The commentary continues on Sports Extra, and we will keep you updated on any big stories in the FA Cup, second round, I should have asked, I presume the draw for the third round is Monday night, it normally is, and Juliette to my left is giving me the thumbs up. Mark Chapman can't surely be going back for the third round draw, can he, from Catalan? Although you never know, dear, I'm convinced sometimes that there's at least three of him. France, Nill, Denmark, Nill, Upa Mccano playing the ball away from the edge of his own penalty area, out to tail Hernandez, gets his head down, crosses the halfway line, looks to his left, and he's hugging the white line over there, Kylian Mbappe takes on Christensen, and then Mbappe decides just to knock it back into centre field, to Tua Mene, and Tua Mene's back in possession this time, and Mbappe more central, he goes for a well-struck, sweetly-struck pass, out to the right-hand side, Dembele taking on Mille, I just can't quite get past him, thought he had, then turns, Christ turn, and then a right foot across, that's a good one in the middle, Giroud battling for it. Defender was there with him, and the two of them just have a little tangle actually after that, Jochim Anderson of Crystal Palace, and I think the Giroud just sort of, there was a brief interaction between the two of them, and then Giroud just walked away. That's exactly what Giroud needs, is Dembele to get that ball, and go past the fullback, or the wing, left wingback as he did Mille, and whip that ball in with pace, and 1v1, but he thwarted him again just, and he wasn't too happy with the defender. Alan, you must be twitching sitting here as the centre forward. Did you not see me jump, and Jo? I was on the end of that one. Watching some of these crosses that are coming into the penalty area, you would have been in your element. I'll apologise now for using my elbows. I was after that one straight away. I know, I might have to have a concussion stoppage in the commentary box. France, Nill, Denmark, Nill. Just watching there, Jochim Anderson incidentally, just took me back to the Premier League at the start of this season when Darwin Nunez ended up getting sent off, when Jochim Anderson wound him up at Anfield, didn't he? Just trying to do the same. Well, I just wonder whether he might be. I mean, good luck with that against Olivier Giroud with all of his experience. I was just about to say that he won't fall for that, will he? You wouldn't have thought so. Particularly, well, who knows, but the heat can do funny things to people, you know. The ball's out of play on the halfway line, and it's a throwing to France. And it is, I would say, about four-fifths full of stadium. That would be my guess. The French in great voice, that's who you can hear at the moment, the French supporters. And Giroud just laying the ball off to the right-hand side, looking for Kunde, but he's been caught up field, although he's helped out by Veran, who comes and chips it forward. And Denmark have got it again at the back, and they go back into their own territory. So it is Kasper Schmeichel with the ball at his feet. I noticed the television cameras were zooming in on him when he was carrying out his warm-up, and he was dressed in that black shirt that Denmark are wearing. You can't see any of the logos from the sponsors, which was part of the whole thing against the human rights in Qatar. But wearing black in these conditions, he was absolutely sweltered. You could tell the sweat was dripping off him. Kasper Schmeichel. Denmark bringing the ball forward towards the halfway line, and Nelson just pops it across to Andreas Christensen. It's a little bit of a rejig at the back for Denmark, with Nelson coming in on the left side of the back three. So Christensen has moved across to the right, the former Chelsea man. Now Barcelona and Denmark go all the way back to Schmeichel again, who plays it out to the right-hand side. Christensen knocks it into the middle. Cornelius trying to hold it up, but France have been able to win the ball back from him, and they've got it inside their own half. Here is Veran, world cup winner, multiple Champions League winner. And France with them back there. And now Hernandez is carrying it forward, the left back, but his pass was behind Giroud, and Denmark have got it back. And it is the day in so come forward, Christian Eriksson, just knocking it back to Meila. And this time it's Denmark, who have possession inside their own half. So there is Kasper Hulmand down there on the coaching area, short-sleeved white shirt, just watching his team coming forward towards the halfway line. Nelson uses Meila, and he's quickly closed down by Kunde, and then back again into the Danish half. I think the debate about whether it's Rabeo or Kunde right back has been an interesting one, that's what they've been talking about in France. And Meila is now taking it on, but it's actually Dembele, who comes back and puts the challenge in, almost in his own right back position, with Kunde backing away. Throw-in is taken quickly, played into the penalty area by Damsegaard. And then back and finds it to Damsegaard again on the stretch, got away from him, then stepped forward, and nipped it away, and then Griezmann passes it forward, and that Danish back line has got to be careful here. In fact, Mbappe was sprinting away, and he was pulled back. Now there were players either side of him, it was just forward of the centre circle, maybe three, four yards, but that was a blatant pull back by Andreas Christensen, who knew that Mbappe was away from him, and he pulled him over. He'd done him, he'd won the ball, he was away on goal. Luckily for him, there were probably two defenders in Anderson and Nelson, who were just within three or four yards, and perhaps would have got to the ball. But all the French players are surrounding their referee there, seeing that they think it should be a red card. I think these defenders have helped him out massively here, because they were within two or three yards of him. If there's no one there, it's without doubt a red. Yeah, it is a yellow, and you can hear the reaction of the French supporters, you can... Well, we're telling you what the reaction is of the French players. They were around referee Marciniak, but he is one of the best referees around in Europe, and it wouldn't be at all a surprise if he ended up refereeing the World Cup final itself, providing Poland don't go very, very deep into the tournament. But it is a free kick, and it's only a yellow card, first of the match to Christensen. He's got that one right, I think. I think so too. D'Ambelli left-footed ball into the air, and that's good as well! Smycon makes the save! The header from Rabiot, from what? 12 yards out, 13 yards out, and he leapt to his right. Smycon was able to parry it away. It's clearly in their game plan, John France. We've seen it on the left-hand side now, and we've seen it twice on this right-hand side, with D'Ambelli whipping those balls in, and if it's not Giroud getting on the end, then it's either going to be Mbappe or Rabiot, as it was then, as it was in the first game. He's given the freedom to do that, and he didn't off-time his runs well. Well, if it carries on like this, and this quality of ball continues to be the case into the Danish penalty area, you would think that it's only a matter of time before Giroud or Rabiot, who's now had a couple of headers in there, actually is able to convert and get the ball into the Danish net, but there are no guarantees that that would be the case. Going back to Kunde, by the way, at the other end, Julian Laun was giving us a bit of insight, wasn't he, into how, when Kunde has played at right-back for France, things have not always, in fact, almost always, not gone well, and the last time he played at right-back, he was sent off against Bosnia and had a terrible match in that position, according to Julian. So we'll keep an eye on that as well. The FA Cup third round draw, by the way, it is 7 o'clock Monday night, and you'll hear it on 5 Live, and you can watch it on BBC Two Monday night. And when we get back, we'll be more or less going straight into the FA Cup third round, won't we? Seems like a long way from sitting here. No time off, John. We don't want that, do we? We never close. We're like Arkwright. France, Nill. Denmark, Nill. Halfway through the first half, and France have had the better of it, but haven't been able to find a way through. Denmark, with it on the halfway line. Giroud gets there first, and I think he was caught by Cornelius. He was, and that's a yellow card. The referee's seen that as a late challenge by the one centre forward on the other in the centre circle. Just stepped on his ankle, and actually, he's down. The big man, the experienced French centre forward, the number nine, Olivier Giroud. Cornelius leaning over him. Just checking to see he's all right, but that's his second Danish player in the referee's notebook. The problem that Denmark have got, John, is that because of the width that Mbappe and Dembele... He just stands on him there, doesn't he? Cornelius on the top of his foot and deserves a yellow card. Nothing more than that. But I was saying, the problem they've got, is because of the width that France have got with Dembele and Mbappe left and right, they're not sure whether to go tight or whether to drop off. And what they've done at the minute is they're okay. You say, you're not going to get in behind us. We're actually going to drop off. So what both wingers or both forwards have done is they're okay. That's fine. We don't have to go past here. We're just going to whip that ball in. And if it's not Giroud, then it's going to be Rabiot, whose time in his run into the box. It's been a clear plan from France in these first 23 minutes, I think it is. That's Alan Shearer with us on Five Live. And remember, you can rewind the live radio on BBC Sounds or indeed on your smart speaker. If you've joined us late, you want to go back and listen to the whole commentary. All you need to do is just ask BBC Sounds to rewind to whatever time it was to go back to the start of our commentary. So ask BBC Sounds or the magic words on that. And you can take the World Cup with you throughout the course of the tournament via BBC Sounds. France Nill, Denmark Nill. 24 minutes played. Giroud is okay. I think Cornelius just sort of stepped on the ball of his ankle, didn't he, which will be painful, but nothing too serious. You'll have a bruise. He might have a graze there, but he's back. I just see him as he's running there, just dragging that foot, but he's okay. France Nill, Denmark Nill. And Denmark bringing the ball out from the back and actually playing it back again into the back line. So this is the third commentary of the day. Big one tonight. Argentina, Mexico in Group C. And after Poland's win, that is a very, very interesting group. Denmark with it inside their own half. Long pass from Jocham Anderson, which is mis-controlled behind Baymeila, and that will be a goal kick to the French. They're in great spirits down there. Lots of trickleers being waved in their area. I've seen various members who've come straight from the French Revolution in the crowd. There are a whole line of them with their tricorn hats. We've got asterisks and obliques in there, as well, I noticed, towards the back of the stand. And France down in front of them, the current heroes, are going to take this goal kick. Almost indomitable in the World Cup. Already a 4-1 win, and they're playing the ball out towards the left-hand side. Obamacano to Hernandez. Hernandez being put under pressure, and France being forced back into their own penalty area. It's knocked across the six-yard box. There have been some anxious moments, as Tottenham have played out from the back with Lloris this season, and there, he just over-hit that pass. And Denmark are back in possession inside the French half, although they go back into their own territory. And it is played forward again by Joachim Andersen. He's right on the halfway line, and he passes it back to his right, to Christensen, and then Christensen, back to Joachim Andersen again. Not too much movement up ahead, so Joachim Andersen will take it on himself, and actually carry it halfway inside the French half. The ball then hits the referee. So we will have an uncontested drop ball. France-nil, Denmark-nil. We've attracted... Well, we say we've attracted, you've attracted. Quite a lot of attention, haven't you? I think that's an official FIFA cameraman who's been hovering around. It's you, John, they're after you. Yeah. They would be wanting the autograph for the minute. Fame at last. Here's Andersen, right for the ball, out to Mala, who had to jump for it, but that meant that he presented the ball to Kunde, who headed it out of play. Mala will take this, 10 yards back from the corner flag, gets it down, just taps it in field, but Kunde was able to get it away. However, the central defender, Nelson, got involved. Nelson, Nelson against the French, that's only just a curtain. It could be his Trafalgar tonight. Here is Hoibier, back to the halfway line, and now Andreas Christensen, Christensen right for the ball to the edge of the penalty area. That's up and headed away by Hernandez out of play on the far side. It was an awful blow, wasn't it, for Lucas Hernandez, with some of the injury problems that he's had to be taken out of the world, cut with a knee injury in the opening match. But his brother steps in, Denmark with it on the right-hand side. Attempted cross, that's blocked out of play by young Hernandez, and it's another corner, and the Danish fans are quite cheered by this. So it's a throwing to Denmark. Ericsson comes short, Christian Ericsson, just a light touch with his right foot, and then Ericsson gets it back again, but I think he might have overrun it. He has, it's a goal kick to the French. And that's what they're trying to do, is Denmark, is trying to stretch the play as well with their two wingbacks when they get the ball and look for that long diagonal pass from one of the three centre halves. So, goal kick, and I think Larisse is going to take this long, yes. There's going to be no more of that faffing about with it, after the latest mini-scare, so he'll take it long. Faffing about, John, that's called playing out on the backs. That's what I meant to say. I know a lot of people who think it's faffing about with the back. And one of them sometimes. Yeah, there's a long ball downfield towards Giroud, but he's beaten, in fact, and Bapé on the edge of the penalty area is beaten in the air by Anderson, and Denmark have got it back. And the thing is, as well, we're talking about the FA Cup second round this afternoon, they'll all be doing it, won't they? Down, you know, the non-league teams against the league teams will be playing it out from the back. Taking short goal kick. As Denmark continue to bring it forward, and Hernandez has to go up on the corner, has to go to ground to slide it out for a throw. Denmark just having a better spell. They've weathered quite a storm, actually, from France, and it's still 0-0, and now here they are, twist on the right-hand side from Lindstrom, who goes for the byline, but overruns it, French cheers, and it's behind for a goal kick to Didier Deschamps' side again. It's really good to have Endon from Hernandez, they just get his body in the way and guides that ball, lets that ball run out for a goal kick for France. So, Lloris will take this, not seen Didier Deschamps on the edge of his coaching area yet, one of the most glittering careers. It's possible to have the old water carrier, as Eric Cantona used to call him in his playing days, but brilliant record as captain of France, World Cup winners, some European Championship winners, and here it comes, and Bappe, and Bappe, brilliant turn, left-footed cross, it's gone all the way to the right-hand side, where it's driven across by Kunde, and it hits a defender in the middle, which took all the pace off it, there was Haibir in there on the edge of his six-yard box, and Schmeichel was able to rather easily just shot across to his left and pick it up. It's impossible to play against when he's got that much grass in behind him for a defender, because what he does is, and Bappe actually stops the defender, then he goes again, and as soon as the defender stops, he's away, and he gets in behind him. On this occasion, his final ball actually led him down, because he was meant to whip it in there for Giroud, who was in there, but it was actually Kunde who gets up to support him, and he gets his shot away at goal. It was on target, I think, but it was blocked. Yep, by Haibir. France, Nill, Denmark, Nill. At halftime, we'll round everything up for you, the latest on Wales, Australia coming as well, and they'll be gathering at Twickenham for England, South Africa. The ball is played behind Dembele, and it's out of play, and it's a throw in to Denmark. And Nelson just knocks it in field. And now it's being carried forward from centrefield by Haibir. They're messing with my mind, Denmark, because last time I sat in this seat, I was commentating in this ground on Poland, who were wearing white shirts, red shorts and white socks. So I'm going to say it now to try and stop myself saying Poland instead of Denmark, as Nelson plays the ball from the left-hand side, and Christensen rolls it down into the full-back position for Lindstrom, and then up on McConaugh comes across and has been able to play it back, according to the Polish officials, into the Danish player, and out of play. Not for me, I thought that was a corner. Lindstrom was making the point that the officials have given it, and it is given as a goal kick to France. What they've done differently though is, is Damsegold on this left-hand side, he was rather isolated, so what he's done is, he's actually made one or two runs in behind to try and support the big man Cornelius up there, and in doing that, he's asking the two centre-halves a different question. There was quite a lot of excitement, wasn't there, when Brenford signed Damsegold this summer, it was quite late in the transfer window after Ericsson had moved to Manchester United, but he's not really been a regular starter by any means, just three starts so far for Denmark, for Brenford, and eight substitute appearances, but he's very much a rising star, 22 years old, signed from Sampdoria this summer, and I'm sure in times to come for Thomas Frankside, he will get himself into the starting line-up, as Denmark have it at the back, Anderson, Christensen plays it away, and then it's up towards Cornelius, who goes down under the challenge, Denmark wanted a free kick, Griezmann takes it on, Giroud back to Griezmann, Griezmann shoots from an angle, saved by the goalkeeper's legs, Dempallet rolls it across, Turemene with a shot, Turemene then heads it's spread, Dempallet who shot his block, and they managed Denmark to get any number of defenders back in the penalty area there, when it threatened to open up for Franz, and somehow we're able to put the blocks in, we saw that save, strange save actually by Schmeichel, from the shot from an impossible angle by Griezmann, from almost on the dead ball line, but he kicked it away, Schmeichel, and that led to the harem scare him in the penalty area, Dempallet now playing it to Kunde, chance for him to cross to the back post, it's headed away by Christensen, and then cleared further away by Lindstrom, who is back inside his own penalty area, comes back again, Franz have stepped it up, Rabiot with a shot, that's into the back of Christensen, and it was hit with such force that the ball rebounded off Christensen, and actually didn't come down, but it dropped off the pitch on the far side. That's twice by the way, he's had to defend really, really well there, Christensen because the ball was dinked in from Kunde down this right-hand side, and Bapier was just about to try and stick his head on the end of it, and luckily the defender got there, and then he got up again and blocked another shot. Yeah, Griezmann plays the ball in from the left-hand side, Cornelius, that looked like a foul, it is, giving us a free kick, Cornelius, who is already on a yellow card, remember, for that foul on Giroud in the centre-circle, this time he's caught Tiuimene, this is between the centre-circle and the penalty area, and Tiuimene has stayed down, and Cornelius has kind of skulked away with his head bowed, I'm ever, ever so sorry, and he's in the referee Marchiniak, I think might just have a little word when he walks past him, but it's a free kick and a good position for France, another chance to put in one of those deliveries. Yeah, I'm sure that's what they're going to do, centre-off is up at the far post, one either side actually. Still no nail, Griezmann is over the ball, with the McCannos standing just behind him, but it is going to be Griezmann to play it in, and it's headed away by Anderson, it was rather casually played in, wasn't it, left-footed by Griezmann, he sort of swamped it up and curled it in, back with Griezmann again, playing it through the middle, bounces off and bat eight, Denmark come forward, Cornelius plays it out to the right-hand side, Denmark could be on for the break here, Cornelius I think he was offside when it was played through, he shoots wide at the near post from the angle. Yeah, I think it was offside as well. Hoibier just delayed the pass too long, I thought. Cornelius makes his run, he plays a lovely one-two with him, and he's looking for it again, and then they're running behind, he's got no other option, but to have a pop-it goal, because there's no one in support of him. But I think he had, I think he just straight offside. So, France-Nil, Denmark-Nil here in Qatar, on the south side of Doha, next to Doha Harbour, so all the cruise ships are reaching an incredible sight, actually. They just came in on the eve of the tournament, the biggest cruise ships you could ever wish to see, five, six more of them all moored in there, and that's what many supporters are doing, are staying on those cruise ships. Ball on the left-hand side with France, France-Nil, Denmark-Nil on five-life. We're going to go back to Wales, Australia in a moment, in the rugby union, the autumn international, but France are coming forward to Omeny, and then Giroud just uses his instep to play it back, centrally, Van Rijn, now it's with Dembele, cutting in from the right turns, back onto his right foot, he loves a turn, doesn't he, Dembele? Again, turns onto his left foot, goes for a high pass to Mbappe, who volleys it across, Giroud with a head-up, headed it down and wide. He was under pressure from Nelson, got up well, but headed it, what, a yard wide? Wow, what great play from all three forwards, from Dembele, the cross over to Mbappe, who then has got the decision to make whether he takes a touch, or actually volleys it first time, of which he chose to do with that left foot, and the hope that Giroud was in there, he was, and trying to get on the end of it, he just doesn't get the connection that he wants, does he, and heads it wide. What about the volley from Mbappe? Not bad, was it? Oh! It was decanio-like, wasn't it? Do you remember the decanio-like? I do. The volley at goal, that this was... The far post, yeah. This was on the other side of the penalty area. If you're on match of the day tonight, well, you might be on match of the day tonight, for all I know, are you? I don't think we'll get back on the highlights, no. Not with your driving, anyway. I see, Pegas can't be Tuesdays on the way back, is it? Well, Steve Bowers just over to our right, and I know he's commentating for the highlights, which are on, I think, 10.30 tonight, I wrote down somewhere. But anyway, my point is, if you were, you'd have that in your highlights. Christensen, brilliant work from him, and then plays the ball right across the six-yard box, and he says, and he's waving his fist in the air, Christensen, St Cornelius, come on! I've just nutmegged Hernandez, and played a ball like that across the edge of the six-yard box, where were you? He's furious, and rightly so, because he does so well to get him behind, he sticks it through the defenders' legs, and then whips it across, and thinking, come on, just get on the end of it, it's seven yards out. Cornelius just stood still, no movement whatsoever. He's absolutely right to be having a right go at him. Make a note of that, because that was... That's as good as they've had, I would say, Denmark. France nil, Denmark nil, half-time approaching, and as promised, the latest from Cardiff now, on Wales Australia from Gareth Lewis. Wales are a few miles an hour above your alleged driving speed, John, they've been relentless this second half, two early second half tries, Jack Morgan and Rio Daya, 34-13 they lead, for that talk of pressure on Wayne Peabock, this is a record score against the Wallabies. Yeah, better sporting news for Wales today, then, and do join us, by the way, for England Wales, here in Qatar, on Tuesday night, and the ball is out of play for a throw-in to Denmark in their own left-back position. That's on BBC One as well, isn't it? Yes, it is. In Wales Tuesday night, so watch it, listen to it. Huge game. Yeah, huge match. France nil, Denmark nil, but that and Bapé Volley, that has been the highlight of the first half for me. What a touch. Came to nothing, but it was pure. Ball over the top by Dembele, ball over the top for Dembele, who gets it down and drives it across, and then, and Bapé arriving onto it on his right foot, 13 yards out, blazes it over the top. And Dembele has got his head on his hands and rightly so, because he's looking at his teammate and Bapé there and thinking, I put it on a plate for you, it's 13 yards out. It wasn't that difficult a chance, was it? He does ever so well, the quick ball down the line onto the right-hand side, and Dembele looks up, Jiru runs to the near post, which then creates the space for him, Bapé. What's that, 20, 25 yards over the bar from on Bapé? So still nil-nil, and Dembele had every right to do a Christensen there, didn't he? To shake his face at him, but I don't think that's the kind of thing you do to him, Bapé. Typical, isn't it? We're just saying how good his volley was across the goal, and he's got a superb opportunity, probably the best opportunity of the game there, and you'd want it to fall to him, but he skies it really high over the bar. That's football. It is. I've done it a few times myself, John. Yeah, well, I would imagine that one of your old teammates, Philipp Albert, walked up the steps a little bit earlier. I imagine he's the sort of character that, when you did that, might have let you know about it, without me thinking that. Everyone let me know about it. I'm more so than being angry with myself, which I'm sure Bapé is at this moment in time. But I have to say, I wouldn't have recognised Philipp Albert if you hadn't pointed him out. Philipp Albert, everyone knows his name. Everyone knows his name, well done, John. France nil, Denmark nil, four minutes to go to half-time, and Bapé runs the ball out of play, so he's seen everything from him. He's human. But Denmark have dealt with him pretty well. Yeah, reasonably well. Absolutely. You're right, he had that volley, but he did find himself in acres of space there, 13 yards out, and that should have been in the back of the net for a guy of his ability. That wasn't a difficult chance. First time I've seen France lie at this World Cup and, you know, in advance to lose the names that they did. Some of the star players that they've lost, including during the tournament, Benzemaak and Hernandez, Lucas Hernandez, never mind Pogba and Kante, et cetera, and more. And yet to still have a team of this quality and the quality that they've gotten in the substitutes as well. Here's Griezmann playing it back, just turning, and Tuan Mayny there, one of the rising young stars, the 22-year-old from Real Madrid, lovely from Dembele, Koundale then runs into Nelson. Oh, that's nasty. That's nasty, I'm afraid. It's a yellow card. It was at pace, and Nelson, that's really hurt. I think it's down in the ankle area, and he's twisted away. He's holding his leg. I'm just hoping that it's one of those that, because of his movement, because of the way that he's moving down there, that he is going to be OK. Yeah, that was a nasty tackle that was. He realised that he wasn't going to get to the ball, you know, and he just pulled out at that last minute, but what he didn't do, he didn't pull his foot away, he left his foot there, which then meant he had nowhere to go other than the top of his ankle. And that was a nasty one. Yeah, the number three, Victor Nelson, who was playing his first match at a World Cup, 24 years old, being brought in, and they're taking great care within here. What it means for the rest of the players is that, in these very warm conditions, if it's anything like this down at ground level inside this stadium, then the players will need a drink to dehydrate. And I see Giroux and Cornelius have just had a little word together. Everything's all right. Yeah, little slap of hands after there. They've had a couple of tussles. Foul by Cornelius in the centre-circle on Giroux. Cornelius was booked for that. And I'm pleased to say that Nelson is getting to his feet now, and he looks OK, but that could have been nasty. That could have been really nasty, yeah. It was a naughty one, that was. He could have pulled away, you know, but he chose not to. Only because he realised he wasn't going to get the ball, he could have lifted his leg up, but he didn't. He left his studs there, which left the outcome that he was going to be a nasty challenge, and it was. Now, a little screen here. We just had a graphic showing us the number of receptions that have been on the field. Some great terminology surrounding this World Cup. They've upped the term and not the stat terminology. And rather hope. Yeah, well, some might say that. Some might say that, receptions. I'm hoping later in the tournament, when it might calm down a little bit, I'm hoping we might get to one or two receptions. You'll see. Any way receptions. I was hoping you were going to tell me. I keep seeing these things. I need either Mark Chapman, who knows all the American terms. Of course, Statman Dave. Dave O'Brien knows them all, and he's on the World Cup daily every day, I think, every day on the podcast, which is free from BBC Sounds, where you get all the reaction, debates and analysis every morning. Then Mark coming forward, and he said, a shot that, I think, it's best to draw veil over that from Christian Ericsson from, what, 40 yards. That was rather tired, wasn't it? He was looking up for options, for forwards options. Looked to his left and his right, and there was nothing. Looked forward, still nothing. So, head down, thought, why not have a hit? Have a go. Well, it wasn't really a hit, was it? No, he pulled it wide, low shot, well wide of Larissa's goal. He's an old teammate, of course, Ericsson and Loris. France, Nill, Denmark, Nill, we're in added time at the end of the first half. It's been OK for Nill, Nill, haven't it? Yeah, it has, yeah. They've had one opportunity, haven't they, Denmark? Nothing on target at this moment in time. Struggled to get the ball into forward positions. Been tested once or twice defensively, but Kasper Schmeichel's been there, and then the main defended OK. Griezmann plays it into the space, Hernandez is taking it forward, he likes to do that every opportunity. And now Mbappe, we've seen good, very good, bad and indifferent from Mbappe in this first half. Now, he has Rabiol, Rabiol then chips it onto the chest of Mbappe, and Mbappe curls it in, and that was the indifferent. In fact, it was verging on the poor, and it was over everyone inside the penalty area, beyond the far-posed goal kick. That's your fault, ever since you said that was that, that great volley, you watched it on match with the day later on, he's had three touches, and every single one's gone out to play. Yeah, he's gone from pure to poor, if I can put it in the... You were going to say something else then? France, Nill, Denmark, Nill. So, at a time, Julien Nouron, I see, is in position to give his verdict on France at half-time, will be joined by Kelly, who's in our cat-art studio, which makes it sound a bit grander than it is, Alain, I don't know whether you've been in it yet, it's basically a room in a flat, as the ball is back towards the halfway line, and now it's Nelson, who slips the ball forward, and then Mailer on the left-hand side, and now Mailer looks to get it back, there's a stretch, but Mailer can't get there, and it's out of play for a throw. It's actually, it reminds me, when you go up that flat, because it's like a flat that's been converted into a studio, and there are people bustling about in every room, and it's what I imagine it to be like if you went into MI5, you know, who are operating on foreign territory, and they've converted this flat into a nerve centre, as Denmark bring it forward through the middle, but that's good work from Rabiot back in there, and then Griezmann just economically plays it out to the left-hand side, and then Hernandez gives it to Mbappe, and Mbappe's running at the Danish defence, and he goes for goal! Jérôme actually throws himself in front of it. I don't think he was trying to glance. What was he trying to do? He handed it back to him. I think he was trying to get out the way of it, you know, because I think Mbappe was maybe going for that far post, in the hope that he'd just catch the Casquah Schmeichel out of play there, because he was running towards that post himself, but he actually hits his teammate in Jérôme. So for his next trick, Mbappe's poll axed Jérôme. France-Nill, Denmark-Nill, and Nelson clears it over the halfway line, and that is the last action of the first half. France-Nill, Denmark-Nill, we've seen some really good stuff from France at times. They had the chances. Some of the deliveries into the penalty area were exquisite, excellent, but Denmark dealt with it. That's the important thing, and no goals, Alan. Yeah, no goals. That'll be the frustrating thing for France. Never really been put under too much pressure from Denmark. Had one or two good moments themselves, but haven't been able to find the back of the net yet. They're just that little bit missing in front of goal. Had one or two opportunities, but for a couple of good saves from Schmeichel. Yep, so far so good for Nelson and Friends against the French. At half time, France-Nill, Denmark-Nill. Excellent reference there, John Murray. Thank you very much for that back with John and with Alan Shearer for the second half of that game at the 9-7-4 stadium. We're also joined by Julian LeRon, and what we've been made aware of, Jules, is that you're being filmed by a FIFA film crew. Tell us more. That's right, Kelly. That's right. I mean, you can't miss them anywhere because they follow me everywhere, sound engineer, and the camera. Obviously, as many people do, it's them and all the people with their phones held up to film you. It would be for a Netflix documentary on the World Cup, and we'd also go on FIFA Plus. Not me, not me. I really show you. It's not me. I'll just be, I'll have a small pie in here, I think. I've shattered our illusions anyway. Me and John, we thought they were following us. I think you're the cutaway for this instance. Can I have a word? We're not that important anywhere, you see, John? Not anymore, I really say anything. The worst thing is when it gets captioned, and it says Julian LeRon and Friends. And two guys. Listen, to their four, you are the man to ask about this first half for Friends. How on earth are they not in front in this game? I'm wondering, too, Kelly. I thought there was a lot of very good things in that first half. I think he was very positive. They just need a bit in the final thirds, maybe a bit more efficiency, being a bit more clinical. I think on the ball from Dembili to Mbappe, and that one touch volley towards Jiru, Jiru is slightly late. But if he's maybe half a second earlier, I think he smashes the header in the back of the net, instead he goes wide with his shoulder. So it's not far, it's coming. What I was the most impressed with really is the control of that game. Apart from the Cornelius shot that might even have been offside, they didn't check because they didn't have to. There was nothing else really from the Danes, and we went on a pressure, I thought the midfield worked really, really hard through a mini-rabio, which we highlighted before the game. And then there's Griezmann, me and Alan. Before the game, we were just discussing it quickly, this new role for him, almost as an 8, as a hybrid 8 and 10. But just the way he fluidifies the game is fantastic. And because he works so hard, because this is the Atlético Madrid and Diego Cimeone's school, he will always come and defend and tackle and recover the ball. And I think he's recovered four or five balls already in that first half. And he has become so important in that new formation that I think, again, apart from the fight that they haven't scored, there was a lot of positives so far. Lot of positives for France. We'll have a bit more chat on that very shortly. We'll also update you with all the rest of the day's sport after the BBC News with Jill McKenzie. Take the World Cup with you. Catar 2022 on BBC Sounds. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. The Commissioner of London Fire Brigade says it's likely some people will lose their jobs after a review found the organisation was institutionally misogynistic and racist. Andy Rose says he's heartbroken and has promised change. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has echoed that. This report has to be a watershed moment when we get rid of the institutional racism, homophobia and discrimination that exists in our fire services. It's possible to say we've got some wonderful firefighters, but there are serious problems in the fire brigade. The Home Office says the death of a man who was held at the Manstern Migrant Processing Centre in Kent may have been caused by diphtheria. He died in hospital last week. It's understood he got to the UK by crossing the channel on a small boat. Several people are missing after a mud slide on the Italian island of Ischia. Heavy rain triggered a torrent of mud and debris, which swept away houses and dragged cars into the sea. Rail travel is being disrupted this weekend as train drivers at 11 companies have walked out. The strike action by members of the Aslef Union is part of a long-running row over pay. And videos posted on social media in China appear to show fresh protests against COVID restrictions after a fire in an apartment block which killed 10 people. Authorities in Urumqi have denied that the restrictions stopped people escaping the fire. Beijing is still pursuing its zero COVID policy. This is a public service announcement. Weekdays from 2. It's time for Scott Mills on Radio 2. Would you mind doing me a quick review? You do brilliant. I've been enjoying you on Radio 2. You're a very nice mum. Thank you very much. Every time this comes on Radio 2, I turn it right up. The heads go in, the shoulders go in. I'm, like, bouncing around on the seat. Probably one of the world's most embarrassing mums because of your show. Scott Mills on Radio 2. Tell all your friends on that school run to turn Radio 2 on as well. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Scott Mills all the way. Weekdays from 2. Listen live on BBC Sound. BBC Five Live. The FIFA World Cup. Qatar 2022 with Kelly Capes. At 7 o'clock this evening, Argentina are looking to kickstart their World Cup campaign after an opening day defeat by Saudi Arabia. They take on Mexico. Full commentary of that one from 7. From the Lissalle Stadium. 4 o'clock kickoff was france against Denmark, so we're back there for the second half very shortly. And we can bring you up to date on the big rugby union internationals taking place this evening. Let's get the waste to the ladies. First of all, from Wales against Australia with Garth Lewis. Yeah, this is Wales' to win now. 34-18 they lead. Four tries on top. Australia have narrowed the gap after a strong finished by Mark Nawan, Kanete Wase. I'm glad we're not doing commentary this afternoon. So Wales then on course for the victory they need and they wanted. The big question, though, bearing in mind Australia and without 14 players for this fixture this afternoon, how much does it ease the pressure on Wales head coach Wayne Peabock? 34-18 Wales lead, although Justin Tipperick, the captain, has just been sinvend. Garth, thank you very much for that. Garth Lewis keeping us across everything there and we're getting ever closer to kick off at Twickenham, where England will take on South Africa at 5.30. Chris Jones is there for us, and it's equally important for both sides, Chris. It feels that way, doesn't it, Kelly? Both sides have had an up and down kind of November, so Africa have lost in Dublin, and they've lost in Paris, but had a very impressive win against Italy last time. At England with that defeat by Argentina at the front of the month, they recovered against Japan, and that crazy game against New Zealand this time last weekend. For 60 minutes we thought, is this as bad as England have been under, ready, Jones? And then they pulled out the bag in the final 10, scored three great tries and had this place on its feet. England said they want to get Twickenham bouncing, but this week not just for 10 minutes, for 80+. Yeah, you called it a cure at Zeg on the podcast, and it's hard to predict because of that performance how England are going to turn up for this one against South Africa. And that's the big question, Kelly. Was that final 10 minutes an outlier? And actually we should be focusing on the 60 or 70. When England did some good stuff, don't get me wrong, but countless times they got to the 22 and weren't able to execute. Would you look at that final 10 and go, right, that's when England have turned a corner. That's the England team they keep promising they're going to be. That's England team that can explode into next year, into World Cup year and make a real dart on that World Cup trophy. Hopefully we'll get some more answers after the 80 minutes this afternoon. Eddie Jones has been joking that Razio Rasmus might emulate Jose Mourinho by hiding in a laundry basket for this one, because he's been banned again over tweets about refereeing. What's been going on? Well, you wouldn't put it past the Rasmus to find his way into Twickenham, come on, mate, but he is banned from involvement with the Springbok squad on match day. This has been a saga going back 18 months. If you remember, he unleashed that extraordinary hour-long kind of diatribe against the officials after the first test of the Lions series in 2021. That got him a year ban. He came back from that ban and then was tweeting away after the Arling game, tweeting away after the France game, and he's got a straight two game matchday ban from World Rugby. There is an update, Kelly. Razmus and South African Rugby have released a statement today saying they met with World Rugby on Thursday. They had, quote, positive discussions and they agreed, all parties, apparently, that further dialogue was needed in terms of enhancing the process that operates between teams and match officials. That statement implies that no one's really at fault, and it's Arasmus and World Rugby who are to blame. But in reality, Arasmus has gone so rogue over the past 18 months. A ban was inevitable. Let's hope, though, this is a line in the sand. And after the game today, we're talking about the players rather than the officials. Yes, further dialogue, just not on Twitter. Chris Jones there with the update. Thank you very much for that. And there's been a try at the match between Wales and Australia. Gareth Lewis. Yeah, another try for Australia. It's that man again, Mark Nawang Kanat-Iwasi, completely against the run of play, just in Tipperwick in the Sinbin. Australia have pulled it back to a nine-point deficit. They're on top this past five minutes, too, with just nine minutes to go. Wales 34, Australia 25 from nowhere. It is suddenly a very, very nervy finishing cardiff. Oh, Gareth, that's exactly what they don't want. Thank you so much for joining us. Gareth will keep us up to date with everything that happens there. Meanwhile, in the FA Cup, it's Forrest Green against Alva Church, and Chris Coles is watching. And Forrest Green are into the third round of the FA Cup, Kelly, for the first time. In 12 years, they've beaten non-league Alva Church 2-1. Conor Wickham's penalty, Josh March's stooping header, a glorious Jed Abbey equaliser for Alva Church, sandwiched in between. The final 20 minutes had to be carefully negotiated with Forrest Green reduced to 10 men. Don Bernard sent off the two yellow cards, two late challenges, one in each half. It did give the non-league side a lift, but they didn't take advantage. And their valiant run in the FA Cup ends in the second round. Forrest Green have a place in Monday's draw, 2-1 winners over Alva Church. Thank you very much for that. Chris Ellsworth, Chesterfield of the National League have beaten League 2 AFC Wimbledon 2-0. National League South Farnborough are drawing one all at Wrexham. And you can follow all the scores on the BBC Sport website and app. Also to come on Five Live tonight, there's live commentary of Gillian White's heavyweight fight at Wembley against the unbeaten American Jermaine Franklin. That will be in Stephen Nolan's show, which starts around about 10.15. Tonight, though, we're going to have second half commentary this afternoon of France against Denmark, followed by Argentina against Mexico. Final game of the day, Argentina trying to get their World Cup up and running. Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton are a commentary team for that one. Guys, you'll be delighted to know I'm coming to see you at the LaSalle stadium. What can I expect? You can expect a pretty breathtaking view. It's the stadium, Kelly. We were in for the Brazil game the other night. The atmosphere in here for that one was incredible. It's absolutely enormous, holds almost 90,000 fans, loads and loads of Argentina fans in particular, already inside the stadium. And I'm slightly worried, Kelly, that Chris's head might explode during the commentary because he's done about three sheets of A4 on the possible permutations in this group. The key one, though, the key one, Kelly. And this is what makes this so interesting, so exciting tonight. The real jeopardy of it is if Argentina lose the game, they are out of the World Cup. We think it may well be Lionel Messi's last World Cup tonight. He equals Diego Maradona, the great Maradona for number of World Cup appearances. If he starts the game, we haven't got the team sheet as yet. He's one goal behind him in terms of World Cup goals. Crucially, he's won World Cup win behind him as well. And I think you could speculate, and this is only speculation. If Argentina were to lose this game, would he definitely start in the final game if nothing was on it against Poland? Could it be Messi's very long start? That's speculation, isn't it? It absolutely is, Chris. And that's what you'll be doing post-match, should Argentina be not progressing to the group stages if they lose this game. But as Ali was saying, there are so many possibilities in this group because Argentina were beaten so unexpectedly by Saudi Arabia. It's thrown everything wide open, Chris. It absolutely has. I've just spent the last 45 minutes writing down all the permutations. We haven't got long enough now to go through them. I will explain all later, but what do we know? In detail. Argentina in great detail. But Argentina are under severe pressure, and nobody really could have believed that they're in this position after playing Saudi Arabia in the first game. So we know the expectation back in Argentina. There's a great expectancy every time that they enter a World Cup competition. And of course, you know, it could be Messi's last World Cup this. He will want to go out on a high. So really, it's a game that Argentina feel that they have to win. Chris, I want to ask you as well about the reports that Rangers have been given permission to talk to Michael Beal about their vacant manager's position. He's at QPR, of course, at the moment. What are your thoughts on that? What are my thoughts on that? Well, you know, he was there before, wasn't he, Michael Beal? The thing I can't get my head around is it was only a few weeks ago. I think he was offered the Wolves job. And then, you know, he got a lot of praise because he said he's going to stay at QPR because of loyalty towards the QPR players. So, you know, I've got to say, if you're a QPR fan, you look at him like as a bit of a turncoat if he goes up and gets the Rangers job. But, you know, he knows the club inside out, made a bit of an impact under Steven Gerrard, you know, as a coach there. So, I mean, it's one to watch. But my biggest take on it, if you're a QPR fan, I think you're going to be really disappointed in Michael Beal if he goes up and talks to Rangers. Yeah, your focus this evening, though, very much on Argentina against Mexico. Chris Attenin, Alistair Bruce Ball from the La Seille Stadium. Mark Chapman will bring you coverage of that. Julian Laurent is watching France against Denmark. No goals as yet, but plenty of chances for France in that game. John Murray was saying in commentary jewels that Kylian Mbappe was so frustrating. There was the good, the bad and the indifferent from him. It's almost as though he's got maybe frustrated, maybe even bored and uninterested as the game's gone on without him being able to impose himself on it. Yes, it's incredible, really. I mean, we said, remember before the Australian game, that he wanted this to be his stage. And the problem is, I think sometimes he wants it too much. So, he tries too hard, in a sense, because he wants it to... He wants to make it happen every time he touches the ball, which is not really possible. So, at times, it makes the wrong decisions. Too many times, maybe. But then you also know that the one time he would make the right decision, something will happen. So, it is frustrating at times. He's still only 23. That would come with age and experience, I guess. But again, he has to come through him, because I think he's, again, the most important asset that we have going forward. The thoughts there of Julian Laurent, French football journalist and subject of a Netflix documentary. Thank you very much for joining us, Jules. Good to hear your thoughts. I'm sure we're here from your full time as well. Thank you very much to Julian. Time now for the second half to get underway with Alan Shearer and John Murray. Thank you, Kelly. I feel honoured, don't you? Well, I feel disappointed that the cameras weren't for us. Jules is Netflix, man, and all that sort of thing, all the rage. Right, second half underway. France, Nill, Denmark, Nill. Denmark have made a change. They've taken off the centre forward, Cornelius, and brought on Martin Brathwaid, the former Middlesbrough and Barcelona man. Small club that, isn't it? Now playing for Espanyol. I think he had to work very hard, Cornelius, but I think the other factor, isn't it, that Cornelius was on a yellow card and there was that challenge, wasn't there in the second half? You do not want to go down to 10 men against this lot. No, and I also think he'll give them more energy and the ability to run in behind. Which is what France are doing now, and the ball is being carried forward by Dembele, who's taken it a long way, cuts in field, gives it to Mbappe on the left-hand side. He lifts it into the penalty area. Rabiot's in there as well, couldn't get it down. There were defenders in there in the white shirts, and Denmark have been able to work it away. So no changes for France at half-time. Loris Engol, back four of Kunde, Veran, Uppermakano, and Theo Hernandez, then Tua-Mani and Rabiot centrally. Dembele on the right and Bappe on the left, and Griezmann in this free-roll that we've been talking about all evening, with Giroud up front, Olivier Giroud, who needs one goal to become, on his own, France's record scorer. And Denmark, having made that change, Michael Engol, back four of Anderson, Christensen and Nelson, with Rasmus Christensen on the right, Jochen Meiler on the left, Hoibierre and Ericsson in the middle, and then Lindstrom and Damsegaard in the wide areas, with substitute Brathwaite up front. Australia have scored in Cardiff to convert a try, Wales 34, Australia 32, with five minutes to go. So Wales 34, Australia 32, and not long left. England, South Africa kicks off at Twickenham, at 5.30 UK time, and Chris Jones will keep us updated on that. Neil Neil here, France, Neil, Denmark, Neil, remember, France need to win to confirm their place in the last 16. Ball back to Rabiot, but Rabiot is going to be dispossessed, he is. And it's a battling Hoibierre, who takes it away from him and then passes it forward, but Lindstrom won't reach that defender, Hernandez was there to see it back to Lloris. Denmark start again with Hoibierre, Ericsson helps it forward towards the newly arrived Brathwaite. Then the balls played to the left-hand side to Meiler. Then a little ball back to Ericsson, finding the space. Ericsson's ball, that's an excellent ball in, but beyond Brathwaite and through, and beyond the six-yard box and the far post for Golcic. That's a really, really clever ball from Chrisian Ericsson there. He just picks his head up and whips that in with his left foot, and he's crying out for someone to get on the end of that. And Brathwaite, who's just come on at half-time, wasn't alive to it, was he? It was an excellent ball in. That's classic Chrisian Ericsson that, wasn't it? You know, sometimes football can be so simple, and there, Ericsson just found the space. Well, a cross like that deserves someone to be on the end of it, and he must be asking to himself this, and, come on, there's not much more I can do there. Put the ball into the danger area, get on the end of it. France, Nill, Denmark, Nill. Five-live and BBC Sounds, as we heard from Ali and Chris. Argentina, Mexico coming up. That's a seven-o'clock UK time, and more live sport after that, because the Dillion White-Germain-Franklin fight is live on Five-Live Tonight from Wembley at 10 o'clock. So, almost from dawn to dusk, here come Denmark, through the middle with the run. It is from Lindstrom, but he just runs into blue shirts on the edge of the penalty area and loses possession, but here is the short blonde-haired Chris Dinson on the right-hand side, winning a throw-in off Hernandez, throw-in five or six yards away from the corner flag, takes it quickly, runs up, gets the ball into the penalty area, but France win it back, Rabiol wins it back, and then Griezmann lifts it forward to Mbappe, and Mbappe with that golden number 10 on his back, is away with the ball down the left-hand side, defenders are with him, two of them, Denmark have got with the great man, and Mbappe is crossing into Dembele, who lifts it back, and Mbappe was almost in. Oh, the lightness of touch there was brilliant, but Schmeichel was able to come out and grab it on the edge of the six-yard box. It was a really clever play. First of all, the pass from Griezmann, the first time passing to Mbappe, which sets him off down this left-hand side, and he cuts in on his right foot, and he's looking for some support, and Dembele comes all the way across, and he fizzes it into him, and he tries to play that little one-two, but just that much pace on the ball, actually, Schmeichel comes out and collects it. Feels like a real treat, this, actually, with some of the talent that is out there, and it feels like, even though we've not seen any goals tonight, it feels like they're in the mood tonight, and some of those touches in there from Mbappe and Dembele, while Ericsson at the other end, as we mentioned, here is Brathwaite through the middle. Brathwaite, the number nine, plays it into Voran, who's chasing after it. He won't reach it, it bounces away from him. It's like watching a fielder who couldn't get to the ball that was crossing the boundary rope. It's a corner. It's a good play, that. Really good play from Brathwaite. He tries to hit the ball into the run, and Lindstrom, who's running behind him, but takes that deflection off Voran, and they get a corner out of it. Yeah, corner. So, not the perfect metaphor, cricket, when you're commentating on France, Denmark, but I'm sure that listeners at home will know what I mean. The corner from the right. Ericsson to take this. Be quite the shock if Denmark took the lead. Set peace chance. Ericsson stands off the field. They're yet to score their first goal at this World Cup. Ericsson driving in deep this one towards the back post, and it's headed across by Christensen, but Loris is able to come and catch it comfortably above the head of Brathwaite, who pretty much stayed on the ground, actually, and the French goalkeeper had the ball safely, and there was black gloves at his. Yeah, there was no trouble there for him. The header of the far post was too high, and it invited the goalkeeper to come and get it, and that's exactly what Loris did problem over. That's the voice of Alan Shearer with us. Special guest on Five Live for this match. I presume we'll be hearing you as the tournament continues. Haven't been called special for a while, John. Special. Special. Just expecting guest. I wasn't expecting special. Only special people are called special. I feel like working with you. It's fine. You and Jose Mourinho. You're the special one. And Kevin Keegan, of course, special K himself. Absolutely. France, Nill, Denmark, Nill. As France play the ball back deep into their own half. I suppose, which one are you doing tomorrow then? Japan, Costa Rica, Belgium, Morocco, Croatia, Canada, or Spain, Germany. Spain, Germany. I thought you might be. Yes, I'm there. It's a big one. Yes, we've got a special guest for that tomorrow night. Peter Schmeichel is with us tomorrow night. The ball played forward for France. Griezmann was way offside. I don't know why he kept running, frankly. Denmark stepped up, and it's a free kick. The Denmark halfway inside their own half. So Denmark's still looking for, as I say, their first goal. They've got their first point from the draw against Tunisia, but it would be nervous going into their final match, Denmark, against Australia, who I imagine will have taken great heart from what they were able to do today to get their win. So that is all on Wednesday night. And Denmark coming forward with Mailer on the left-hand side, but just runs into Kunde. And so, Dembele plays it forward, looking for the run of Mbappe. But Schmeichel was quickly onto that. It's kind of telegraphed by Dembele on the halfway line, actually, and even though Mbappe used his pace, Schmeichel was quickly out. That was another incident in the first half, by the way, when Andreas Christensen pulled back on Mbappe when he was running forward from the centre-circle, but there were defenders either side, so it was just a yellow card. He has Brathwaite playing it back into his own half. Just did that run. He just comes off that left-hand side on Mbappe. Because he's got the freedom to go basically where he wants, he actually ran past Giroud and then looked to where to get in behind. I think you should do that more often, because that's a way that I think Franz can get in behind with the ability of Griezmann and his passes. Franz Niel, Denmark Niel, very warm in the stadium. It's almost as warm as any stadium I've been in yet, but I just feel, maybe, the effect of the air conditioning coming into play as Ericsson now, short hair, looks up, looks to his left, gives it to his right, and then the pass in towards the edge of the area for Brathwaite, who takes it away. It was Damsegaard who popped up on the right-hand side, and Brathwaite has been able, with that turn, as the challenge came in to win another corner. That's what he's given them already in the nine or 10 minutes of being playing in the second half. There's just been two or three occasions where he's had that threat and that pace and that ability to run in behind just gives the French defenders something else to think about. 31 years old now, Brathwaite, coming on as a substitute at halftime. Ericsson with this corner then, from the right, just waiting to take it, and... Steady weights. Now, the corner from Ericsson, this also to the back post, but Rabiot was able to get there. It's helped back into the box, taken down by Brathwaite. In comes the challenge, double deflection, but the offside flag is up, and I actually think everyone in the penalty area knew that it was coming. They helped Brathwaite then, because his touch was terrible. So it's a free kick to France. Clearly offside, he was. Two or three yards offside. He was a good job, because he tried to take the touch with his right foot and it bounced about three yards off it. Yeah, you know what I was saying about some of the delightful touches? That wasn't one of them. Tuamene now playing it to the right-hand side. And a ball in field from Kunde, which just presents possession back to Denmark. And now Christensen on the right-hand side. The run is continued, and that's a decent cross from the right-hand side from Damsegaard, but it was blocked actually. I thought it was going to fall behind up on McCarno, but he was able to check himself. Now Griezmann wins the ball back from Christensen, just speed of foot, really. Mbappe turns, and he's got away from Anderson. Brilliant from Mbappe, approaching the penalty area now. Schmeichel is able to just push it up. It was just above him to his right, just got his gloves up there. He almost let it hit his gloves and deflect wide. Superb play from Mbappe. Right inside his own half, the touch to turn the defender, then another touch to actually get away from him. And he's waiting for Giroud to run in behind him, which he does, and he's hoping that it might just open up to go on his left foot. And he has that shot. Superb pace to get him into that position to have the shot he'd go. It doesn't get much better than that. I think watching football at the highest level to see something like that, a moment like that, from a player like that, who is just... It just glides along, doesn't it, with ease? Conat Griezmann to take it to the near post. Doesn't beat the first man. Christensen was able just to watch it onto his forehead and nod it out of play. There's been a dramatic end to the Autumn International in Cardiff. Gareth Lewis, tell us all. Would you believe it? Wales 34, Australia 39. Wales on top for 50 minutes, fell apart in the last half an hour. Lachlan Lonergan with a try that might well bring an end to Wayne Pivak's role as Wales head coach. This was Australia's second. Wales 34, Australia 39. Australia winning it at the end. What a week for Wales. What they need is, Tuesday night, a big win to put everything right. Join us for that on the BBC. France with the ball at the back, still 0-0 here, with just over half an hour to play. Denmark have played really well tonight. I mean, France have really had their moments, but Denmark have stood up to it. They've not let themselves be rattled, not panicked. And it is France with the ball on the right-hand side. Griezmann plays it back into his own half, and France start again. Another well-coached team, which is what Gareth Southgate said about the United States last night and Greg Behrholter. And I think that's another part of the story from last night. I think you've got to accept that with the ability that France have in forward positions, you can't keep them out all the time. And when they've been caught out defensively, they've had the goalkeeper to rely on. So I think the manager will be pretty pleased with the way they've handled themselves and how difficult they've made it for France. As Tumani looks up and plays the ball out to the right-hand side, Dan Belly, he gets it down. Now running at the Danish defence on his left foot, plays it across, and Bapé went for a flick on the edge of the box, but there were two men there, and between them they were able to block it. It was Christensen and Hoibje, but he was trying the extravagant there. And Bapé came to him, it was one of those flicks with the one foot behind the other, with the inside of his heel, and it nearly came off. If it had, I mean, it would have been a classic, it would have been burkamp-like, actually. It was such a clever little free, you'd see what he's trying to do. Here's one for Griezmann, Chester Downey's away from Nelson, and he places the shot over the bar. And it lands in that little entrance area, that is halfway up the lower tier of the stand, and rattles around in there, underneath the sign that says, Do Ha. Well, what a run and what a pass. Two superb things that happened, but the third one, it was hopeful, he tries to hit it on the half-volley with his left foot, but he's leaning back, and it goes about 20 yards over the bar, doesn't it? But the pass and the run were magnificent. Griezmann, who has not scored in his last nine internationals, in fact, ten when you add the first game at this World Cup, so this is the eleventh. And that was a glorious opportunity, as the balls played up towards the halfway line, but it bounces back for Denmark, the man who was the golden boot winner at Euro 2016. Four goals, as France won the World Cup four years ago, and Denmark winning the ball back to Ericsson, who plays it in field, and that was most unlike him, a misplace pass to Tua Mane, however, France haven't cleared it yet, but Tua Mane steps in, and that's good play, with the outside of his boot, and he plays it into the space. Now France could be in business. Hernandez forward towards Mbappe, Mbappe now into the penalty area, back to Hernandez. Hernandez angles it back, and Mbappe is there to score. Drives it in from the angle, and France lead by one goal to nil. Absolutely brilliant on the breakaway, and finally they find a way through this Danish defence, and make it France won Denmark nil, and the champions are on course for the last 16. Well, what a goal it was, and no surprise that it comes from the superstar Mbappe. Again, he gets the ball in his own half, and he drives forward. This time he gets the support from Hernandez, and Hernandez runs in behind, and he has a little look around to see, okay, where are you, and he puts it into his path. What a goal, it was perfection. The little pass in from Mbappe, then he follows it, and he takes it away past Schmeichel. I did wonder about offside when Mbappe initially played it through for Hernandez, and we've not restarted yet. It just takes a little deflection as well in front of Kasper Schmeichel there, because he's standing up, expecting it to go to him, and that little deflection just takes it past him, but it's going to be tight with Hernandez, because the way he runs in behind. It's not said yet on the screen that they're checking for this, the play has not restarted, there's been a change as well. I think Giroud is coming off, yes he is. So, friends, did he a day shot, having seen his team take the lead, he's going to substitute Olivier Giroud, and bring on Marcus Kuran, again, just as he did in the first match, and the goal stands, as far as I can see it, if they've had a look at that, there was no indication that he was offside, so the goal stands, well finished by Mbappe from the angle on the left-hand side, from what, maybe eight or nine yards or so, little deflection as Alan Shearer said, and France lead Denmark by one goal to nil, and Mbappe has scored in both France's matches at this World Cup. Well, John, I was lucky enough to be in the stadium a few days ago, when France played Australia and got a close-up, another view of Mbappe then, and his movement, and his technique, and he's running with and without the ball. As I said earlier, he's almost impossible to stop. When he's running at you as a defender, and he's got grass to attack in behind, the way he stops you, stops the defender, then that gives him that extra three or four yards to get away from his marker, that's exactly what he did, again there, and great support from his left back in, in Hernandez, the way he plays that little one-two with him into the space, and he finishes off really clever. And the thing is, that breakaway, and you have to give praise as well, I think to Tua Meney was, wasn't it, almost in his own right-back position, as France were struggling to get the ball away, Tua Meney took control, played the ball into space with a lovely pass with the outside of his boot, and from that point on, what happened was that for one of the first times in the match, Denmark didn't have numbers back, and France therefore were able to eventually find a way through. That was because they had a little bit more of the game, a little bit more of the ball, and they felt that their confidence was growing, that they could actually put and commit more men forward. In doing that, they've left themselves wide open at the back when they've lost that ball, and they've been punished for it. Well, there had to be goals or goals in this match, there couldn't be another Niel Niel. Well, I said that before the game, and I was thinking, goodness me, I hope someone scores here, you might not invite me back. But you're special. France leading Denmark by one goal to Niel. And it's a throwing for France to the halfway line, Tua Ram chested off, and Bapé plays it over the top, Tua Ram on the chase, well that night the Bienefal, as the defender, it was Hoibier, actually leaned into him, and Tua Ram actually tried to keep his feet, which probably meant he didn't get the free kick. It's a good play of Hoibier, he knew exactly what he was doing, he just nudged him that little bit, didn't he, to put him off his stride, and that's exactly what happened. If he didn't, he was away, clean through on goal. Fair enough to make that change to Dier Deschamps, they've got the lead, they've got their noses in front, and Olivier Giroud at the age of 36, straight off the field. Absolutely, he knows he can't play every minute of every game, he hasn't been at his best this evening, one or two balls have gone up to him and bounced it off him, and then the manager thought, no I'm going to change this, even though we've gone 1-0 up, and got every right to do that. So Marcus Tua Ram is on for his fifth cap, son of Lillian, the famous Lillian Tua Ram. And he has yet to score for France, so he's taken the place of the man who scored, well, more goals, than everyone else apart from Thierry Henry for France, and incidentally on that list, that is Mbappe now to 30, so 30 goals in now 61 internationals, so he is currently 21 behind the joint record. No pressure for Marcus Tua Ram, then, and having a father like he did, and then replacing Olivier Giroud front France's joint record goal scorer. That's lovely play by Lindstrom, who plays the ball into the French penalty area, struggling to get it away, had actually hit, Veran, bounced down, could have gone anywhere, and they were fortunate that it fell to a blue shirt, and Denmark suddenly trying to up it again. Brathwaite putting himself about, and keeping possession though, that's important for Denmark, and they go back towards the halfway line. So Denmark losing, or facing the situation where, by, talk about this win, if it were to be a win taking France through, Denmark would be left with one point after two matches, and up against Australia on Wednesday for a place, as they do come forward again though. The ball's driven across by Lindstrom into the penalty area, blocked by a defender, comes back to him, but either the ball was out of play, in fact it was off the defender and behind for a corner, so it's a corner to Denmark from the right. Yeah, he just runs off Rabiot, who lets him run in behind Lindstrom, and then he's free, he's got all the time in the world to pick his head up and try and pick someone out, but again, Upermenko gets that ball away. Corner though. Ericsson has wandered across there to take it, you know, it feels like with that goal that they've conceded, really, realisation is done here, Denmark, the situation could look quite serious for them tonight. Ericsson across, oh, head up from Andersson, and it's not a win! They've got the equaliser, and it's Andreas Christensen at the back post who arrived, one central defender, not in it on, and Andreas Christensen arrived there at the back post to head it past Loris, and Denmark have made it 1-1. It was a really clever work set piece, because the two that they had three or four minutes ago, they both went to the far post, and Franz dealt with them really comfortably. At this time, it's whipped into the near post, it gets the flick on, and all it needs is someone to get on the end of it, and Christensen does that, and puts it in the back of the net. What a response from Denmark. Yeah, great delivery from Ericsson, and the header on from Jochim Andersson, and just stooping, Ravio with a very high foot pair actually, but he went in with his head, just like central defenders don't mind doing, in amongst the boot, and headed it in from six yards, and it flashed past Loris. So, Franz won, Denmark won, and the French lead lasted for approximately, far, no, hang on, where are we, seven minutes. Well, we said Ravio let Lindstrom run off him three or four minutes earlier to get that corner, and it's his man again that scores. Christensen runs off him as well, and gets to the ball before him. Good response though, isn't it, from Denmark? Wasn't it just? So, one-one, Franz won, Denmark won, quarter of the match to go, after that will be across two. So, Lucille actually tonight, not had the pleasure of going there yet at the World Cup. So, Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton with the commentary, Tim Vickery and Guillain Balagay will be part of the program tonight as well, but Franz coming forward, Dempalli into the box, running freely, and then running into white and red, and Denmark are able to clear it up towards the halfway line to Brathway, who's headed it out for a throw-in on the far side under pressure. So, two goals now, and Bapé for France, Christensen for Denmark. It's almost fitting, isn't it, that Bapé scores for Franz with all everything he's got, all of the skill and the talent, and then the rugged Christensen heads it in from a set piece at the other end. A well-worked set piece at the half. Well-worked set piece. It was really noticeable, actually, the two that they had beforehand went to the far post, didn't get anything with them, this time near post and the flick on goal. Both from the centre-circuit from Turemene, Dempalli has not given this up and rightly so, and he gets there with Anderson, puts it out of play, Anderson gets a little low five from Christensen for the way that he chased that, basically. And now the ball bounces back into the area for Schmeichel to come and pick up. As I say, Casper Schmeichel down there, Peter Schmeichel is here tonight, I think working for TV, and he'll be with us on five... Well, he was on breakfast this morning, Peter Schmeichel, just before I went on talking about England, and he'll be with us for Spain, Germany, which is the late match tomorrow night, which I have to say, I cannot wait for that, that is absolutely fascinating. Well, if the result goes against Germany in the earlier game, Japan win, then they have to go out and they have to beat Spain. Well, it's entirely possible, as Ali said earlier, that Argentina could go out tonight, that is possible, and Germany could go out tomorrow night. Here's Mbappe, France aren't going anywhere, the ball played to the left-hand side, and Mbappe goes one way, then the other, curls it into the danger area, but too close to Schmeichel, he's able to come forward and just grab the ball into his green shirt, blonde hair flowing, and he's got it safely near the penalty spot. He just works that ball onto his right foot, and Mbappe, and he's hoping that two-round just gets across, because he's ready to whip it in, he's just wanting him to run across the front of Schmeichel, but he didn't, he goes straight into Schmeichel's hands. Just be about to get underway, I think, at Twickenham, where it's England against South Africa, so we will let you know what happens there during the course of the next couple of hours. I see Denmark are going to make another change, Caspar Dahlberg, who started the first match against Tunisia, is going to come on as a substitute next, but he has Mala on the left-hand side, Mala rolls it back centrally to Ericsson, Christian Ericsson then squared a hoibier, and now all the way back to the halfway line again to Andersson. Christensen on the left-hand side, Rasmus Christensen that is, and Denmark are keeping possession, so it is France who've had the step off back into their own half, and Denmark played out to the left-hand side to Victor Nelson. Didier Deschamps comes and steps forward, must have thought, yes, on the way now after that exciting Mbappe goal, but it is Denmark who have very quickly found their way back into the match, and Ericsson gives it to Mala, and now a run down into the full-back position by Damsgard, and then across for the shot that is saved by Loris, diving down to his left, big chance, right in the middle of the penalty area for Jesper Lindstrom, who shot too close to Loris, who was able to make the save just down to his left. Well, as soon as they've scored the goal, France have just sat back, they thought the game was over, that's what their attitude would suggest, and they've been put under some real pressure from Denmark, and that was a really good chance for Lindstrom, should be in the back of the net. It should. Great response from Denmark to going a goal down. Denmark who have already remembered beating France twice this year in the Nations League, and France are finding it tough against them again. Another corner, they scored from the last corner from this side, remember. Ericsson, this to the back post, but onto a French head, who's able to get it away, it was Veran underneath it. Back to Ericsson again, Ericsson plays a low ball in from the right, he's fortunate there, it's bounced back to him, off to Ram, and Ericsson goes centrally, and he shoots, and it's hits, Turemene on the edge of the penalty area, and Denmark have got it back in the centre circle. Excellent play from Denmark. Yeah, very good play. They've just sat back, France, they thought the game was won, and Denmark's thinking, no, we're not having any of that, and to their credit, they've stepped it up a gear, and they're creating chances and looking good, and looking a different team all of a sudden. Double change for France coming. They made the change, Damsegaard is off, and Dolberg came on for him, so that is the number 12, Casper Dolberg, who's on loan at Sevilla, and France, this double change, France are going to bring on Kingsley Coleman, and also Canate of Liverpool, Ibrahimak Canate, so it is Raphael Veran, after his return to fitness, so Veran is on at the back, Canate is on at the back, for France, and Kingsley Coleman comes on for... D'Ambelli. D'Ambelli, thanks, Alan. So, Coleman, number 20 on the right-hand side, France playing the ball out from the back, and the score is France won, Denmark won. So, Didier Deschamps feeling clearly the way that the player's gone, since France scored the opening goal, and we're then pegged back that it needs that refreshing, in these sweltering conditions inside Stadium 974. And the ball is with France halfway inside their own penalty area, and Turemene turns and plays it through to Rabiot, and now back with Turemene again, who goes for a driving pass across field, Christensen heads it back into the central area, yet Tendons, by the way, 42,860 is the official attendance here tonight. Griezmann, Griezmann little ball towards the edge of the penalty area, France with the pass to the left-hand side to Mbappe, and Mbappe now well played, Christensen is able to put the tackle in, and it's behind, and it is a corner to France from the left. Good play, good defending that. It makes sense bringing Canate on for Vuran with his lack of game time in recent weeks. So, it is a corner from the left-hand side, Griezmann to take it. This match, 15 minutes to go, it is... This is fascinatingly poised. You can't go anywhere, or if you are going somewhere, take BBC sounds with you. Griezmann with the corner for France, and out-swinger, well done, Andersen, Joachim Andersen got up above everyone else and headed it away to Coleman for France. Now the ball on the right-hand side, and Mbappe is out there. Oh, a lovely change of feet, but it was almost crickle, and I could keep up with there as he went from one foot to the other and played it into the penalty area, but Denmark kept up with it, and headed away to comparative safety. France won, Denmark won, and Griezmann has popped up on the left-hand side here, plays it in field. Tumani, Griezmann, then back into the centre-circle. Canate, having started the opening match, Ibrahimo Canate, but he's seen relatively little football this season. Remember with the injuries that he's had for Liverpool, and now it's back to Rabiol, and Denmark have dropped right off into their defensive third. Still France in possession, Coleman on the right-hand side, and the orange boots, in comes the challenge from Nelson on him. The ball rolls over the white line and behind, and it's a throw-in to France. They're looking to get this game won, but they take the throw-in quickly, and now Rabiol on the overlap into the penalty area, played it across, but the defender was there, Christian St, Andreas Christian St to just coolly put it behind for another French corner from the right this time. Really well worked down that right-hand side. Rabiol give and go, and he gets the ball back, and times his run to perfection. Then you're just looking for that last bit of quality, the toughest bit, to put that ball and make sure someone gets it on the end of it, but Christian St, good defender, and he blocks it. France corner. France won Denmark 1, BBC Radio 5 live at Qatar 2022. Corner in it comes, on his head and wide at the back post. A stretching header. I think a defender at the near post might have got a touch on that. Chumain threw himself at it, diving header at the back post, and headed it wide, might have clipped the outside of the post as well. It hit the defender, Meila. Just comes off Meila, doesn't it? He finds himself about four yards out with a free header, but Meila just gets his block on it, hits his shoulder. It's gone in the back of the net. Great block. I mean, there have been some blocks from Danish defenders in this match, and that was right up there with them. I'm not sure he knew that much about it, so it's another corner. Griezmann to the back post. That's headed away by Christensen. Comes out, four France again. Oh, another lovely piece of skill, and the cross is in, and it's headed wide by the right back, Kunde, and it is deflected wide. It's another corner. This is a third consecutive French corner. Griezmann, one from the right, one from the left. Now another one. Denmark are under severe pressure. His delivery is superb from the left side and the right side. The way he whips the ball and makes it very, very difficult for the defenders to head away. So Griezmann goes across there. This is at the end where all of the French trickleers are, and they are being twirled in big numbers, and Griezmann in it comes. Schmeichel comes and gets a punch on it, just sort of rather daintily punched it up and away out of the penalty area. Then it's played back in from the left-hand side, and from the far side. Rabiot went for it with a kind of scissor overhead kick, but he hit it wide of the far post, high and wide, and it's behind, and a goal kick to Denmark. Well, that's been a theme of the night for France. Is there any opportunity they've got the ball into the box, whether it's from the left or the right, they've just thought, get it in there, and Rabiot was at the far post there. A bit of an acrobatic one, wasn't it? Some sad news has just been announced, Alan. Sorry to say that the former Scotland and British Lions rugby union player, Doddie Weir, has died. He was 52 Doddie Weir. As you might know, he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2017. So the sad, sad news for all of his friends and family, that Doddie Weir has sadly died. But what an absolute inspiration he has been in the later years of his life. I have a feeling, Alan, that you will have known him well. Yeah, and you and RIP big man, and send our condolences to all his family. What a family, what they've done. Absolutely incredible. Has Denmark come forward, balling from the right, that is swept wide by breath weight, arriving on it on the edge of the six-yard box, could chance that for Denmark. But I think you can just imagine the tributes that there will be being paid from all over the world to Doddie Weir. And we will have more on that later. And our rugby union correspondent, Chris Jones, of course, is at Twickenham, watching England against South Africa. So we'll hear more from Chris, who will be rounding it all up, everything that everyone's saying about the great Doddie Weir. Sad news. And of course the great work that he's done and raising awareness for MND with him and his good mate Rob Burrow. What a sad day. Very, very sad. Ten minutes to go here, France won, Denmark won. It's just a game, this isn't it, Alan, that we're watching here. Feels like it means the world, but it is just a game. Tumani has taken a bang in center field, and so we'll have a stoppage now. commentary to come later on Argentina, Mexico, that's from seven o'clock UK time with Alastair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton. And then, as I say, the Dillion White, Jermaine Franklin fight live from Wembley after ten o'clock tonight. Tumani has stayed down, actually. He's setting up, he's okay. He just clashed with his teammate, didn't he, Rabi? Or they both sort of ran into each other and he got the worst of it. So as it is, France won Denmark won. This group would certainly not be done yet. France's final match on Wednesday against Tunisia, where Tunisia will have to win that. It's a little bit like the England-Wales game on Tuesday night. It's a must-win game for Wales, that one, and that will be a must-win game for Tunisia against the World Champions. But that group with this scoreline, that will go to the final night. And Tumani is okay, he's received treatment and he's trotting back onto the field. Six minutes or so to go. Denmark in possession and Hoibje plays it out towards the far side. Then it finds its way back centrally to Ericsson. And Ericsson turns, just taps it out to the left-hand side to Nelson, Victor Nelson. In field, Andreas Christensen, high ball now to the right-hand side. Rasmus Christensen, Christensen to Christensen, one with a C, one with a K. And then his ball down the line looking for the run of Lindstrom down into the full-back position. But that was dealt with very well actually, Uppermakarno. And the ball is behind and it is a goal kick to France. Lindstrom's not going to win that ball, is he? Uppermakarno. Yeah, that is... I mean, he's quite willowy, isn't he? Lindstrom, there's not much meat on him. The ball is played forward by France, but chested down by Nelson. And Denmark will start again from inside their own half. Joachim Andersen just looks up, fair-haired bobbin, uses Hoibje. Hoibje just turns and angles it back. Pierre-Emile Hoibje with his French connections in his family. Big night for him this. Now the ball on the right-hand side, Christensen's running at Rabiol, one way and the other. Christensen's ball in, actually hits the defender on the edge of the penalty area and then bounces out and a shot from distance from Hoibje, but he pulled that wide from all the 25 yards out and it is a goal kick. And Denmark are going to make another change and it is the Danish... Obviously he's a Danish midfielder, the Brenford midfielder. Christian Norgard coming onto the field and he's going to replace Lindstrom, who was just involved in that latest attack. So Lindstrom off and Norgard coming on. I think that's a clear indication from Casper Hulmand about where we are in the game. Forward player coming off and Christian Norgard coming on in there, in between Hoibje. In fact, Ericsson just maybe just being shifted a little further forward. Well, if it was to say this here, this would be a really good result for Denmark, because they would fancy their chances going into that last game, wouldn't they? They would. So Christian Norgard is on and we have five minutes to play, plus added time. France with it on the right-hand side. The ball is played over the top and Coleman back onto his left foot. In fact, he leaves it for Griezmann. This could be dangerous. Griezmann's ball in and Bappe is there at the back post. He scores again and he runs away, hands apart, and Bappe jumps over the advertising boards in amongst all of the photographers and runs to all of the French trickle-ers behind the goal there. What a star he is. But there was the ball in from Griezmann, really, that made that. Schmeichel could do nothing about it and France are back in front, two-one. And it was the run of Coleman, the way he just goes short and then spins and then it gets the ball and he's running into the space. Griezmann backs him up and says, no, leave the ball, I'll put the ball in, I'll cross it. And he had the quality and there's that man again in Bappe at the far post just to tuck it away. What a goal. What a brilliant run and cross. That's ominous for all Golden Boot chasers and Bappe scores his second goal of the game, his third goal of this World Cup and this is only the second match. Chimney's run perfectly almost. Yeah, it is going to be a really tight one, but what about the cross? And the run from Coleman makes it all as well before, you know that. Just a few seconds before and he just managed to get across the defender and sort of nudge it in with his right thigh there and Bappe at that far post. But the run from Coleman, he goes short and then the defender's stupid enough to go with him, which then creates the space in behind and that's where the cross comes from because Griezmann backs him up and as I said about the quality, whether it's from the left hand side or the right hand side and no surprise, it's another cross from France. They've put so many in there tonight and it's been successful for them. Yeah, as Julian LaRonge was telling us before the game and as you might have seen for yourself from the first match, the Australia game, this role that Griezmann's been giving, kind of roving number 10 role, you know that he can cause some damage in that position. He has done in this game and that was the delivery. I mean, it was almost unstoppable when Bappe was there. I mean, he was at what, a yard out, something like that? And as Alan says, sort of just jumped at the ball, it hit him on the upper right thigh and Schmeichel on the goal line, couldn't do anything about it, it was in the net. It's just a superstar, isn't it? You can score all sorts of goals. You can. I mean, that's a scruffy goal there from a yard or two out. That's fine. You don't get two for scoring one from about 30 yards and beating three players. That to me would mean more than having the volley from the edge of the box or whatever it may be. It's a scrappy goal, but at least he's in and around the 60 yard box to get those goals. Well, time's running out. We're in the 88th minute. Dan Markovic have already come from a goal down to make it 1-1. Now they're 2-1 down. I'm not sure they've got it in them to come up with another one, but let's see. You know, you cannot underestimate this Danish team. They've got bags of spirit, but they've not got bags of time in this match. Anderson, little ball forward. Norgaard, one of the recently arrived substitutes. In fact, I'm not sure he touched the ball by the time Franced scored their second goal. Back to Christensen on the right-hand side. Now Anderson, he's going to try a shot. It's deflected to the edge of the penalty area where Coleman takes it down, and now Kingsley Coleman is carrying it forward, and Babby wants it, and Babby wants it. He's on the hat-trick, but Coleman didn't pass the ball. He was on the top of the open down in anticipation. Come on, give me the ball, pass it. Here he is now, he has got it. He runs away from Christensen, who tried to take him over at thigh height, but he wasn't going down there on Babby. Then there was a couple of stepovers for good measure, but Norgaard had arrived on the scene, so he goes back into his own half. I don't see a weakness in his game. He described him as a superstar. He's got incredible talent. Whatever you want, the touch or the technique, the left foot or the right foot, the spring in the air, the ability to finish it off, the ability to get in and score the great goals as well as the scrappy goals. I don't see a weakness. He's fantastic. Great to watch. It's Alayla Blurr time inside the stadium here, next to the dock. Stadium 974, the attractively named stadium next to the gulf. As they're singing, Alayla Blurr, Didier Deschamps, who's going to make another substitution, Yusuf Fafana is going to come into the midfield, the Monaco man, Didier Deschamps, look towards those supporters singing, Alayla Blurr, and he clapped his hands a little bit like Mick Jagger does when he's on stage. That little sort of clap like that. And France have got the ball in his own half. I do get the impression, you know, that Babby is happier in this team or this squad without Benzema, as stupid as that sounds with the talent that he has and his ability, etc. But I just think that Babby is that little bit happier, and maybe the squad is. Yeah, and when you've got a happy and Babby, that spells danger for everyone else. Two goals in the match, Denmark coming forward, cross from the left-hand side, and it will be seven minutes of added time for the team that will play in this game. And here's a long ball pumped forward for France. Oh, and Babby is under this. He goes for goal as it drops over his shoulder and bounces up, but shoots straight at Schmeichel from the edge of the area. And look at the reaction of his partner up front. He's screaming at him, thinking, you can pass that to me. He's in the middle of the goal, but no, he's on the hat-trick, he's sitting up nicely for the volley, he just didn't catch it right. He's greedy centre forwards, Alan. He's on the great, eh? Should be more of them. But he had... He was like a sort of... I'm not passing that either, by the way. But the way he was going for goal there, it was a little bit like Gaza, you were in 96, wasn't it, but just further out on the edge of the area. But it was the way that the ball dropped over his shoulder, just as it bounced up. Is there any reaction though, John, is that when your teammates are looking at you and you stick your hand up to say, yeah, I know, I'm sorry, you've got every right to go for his hat-trick. Yeah, of course. France two, Denmark one. Denmark coming forward, laid off by Brathway, a little flick on the edge of the box, but there was no one there in a white shirt. So we're well into time at it on now, in the second minute of the 7th. England, South Africa is underway, and if you've just switched on to us on 5 Live, more very soon on the sad news that has just been announced this afternoon, the sad death of Doddy Weir. So more on that coming shortly. The latest Danish change, Christensen, goes off, and it is the No. 26, Alexander Bar, who comes on from Benfica, the right back, so that's a straight swap, his first taste of action at this World Cup. So Mark Chapman will be picking up very shortly, as we also build up to Argentina against Mexico, the big match tonight. And France making the change, it's Griezmann who's coming off, he's had a good night, Alain Shearer. Very, very good, great quality on the ball, when he's got the ball at his feet left foot, his ability to pick a pass, and the way to pass has been sensational, and every opportunity, him more than anyone, when he's got the chance to put the ball in the box, he has done that. So Yusuf Fafanar is on for what is only his fourth cap for the 23-year-old, as I say, from Monaco, the No. 13 that he is. So deep in added time, Denmark straining to see if they can find this second equaliser in the match. This is going to leave Denmark on just one point after two matches, and France will be through to the last 16, the defending champions. Defending champions have not fared well at recent World Cups, but France will be through with a match to spare, and you know what that means. And actually, it's a fair point for Tunisia, and sure Didier Deschamps will make a number of changes, certainly with a World Cup being played here in the desert. However, all you have to do is look at some of the talent that is on the bench, who would be coming into the team, and also playing for places in the knockout stages of the World Cup. Maybe it won't make it any easier for Tunisia. We've spoken about the injuries in the French squad that we had before the tournament, and of course, leading up to the tournament, but when you've got Mbappe in your team, you have got a real live chance of being successful in this competition. He's that good. 2-1 France lead. We'll round up the main stories in the FA Cup as well, for you, De Gannon and Red Bridge against Gillingham currently being played. But the ball on the right-hand side with Denmark, and now Ericsson inside the box. It's taken on by Barr on the right-hand side into the penalty area, but Ravio was there as that final line of defence volleys it downfield. It's not Mbappe who's chasing at this time, it's Turan, but Mbappe is set off, and he is sprinting now into the D on the edge of the penalty area, but Dembele doesn't try and find him. He just takes the ball towards the corner of the penalty area, beats two men, plays it back to Mbappe on the edge of the box, who is on his back foot, actually, and that meant that Mela could put in the challenge. Still France with it. Coleman on the right-hand side comes back. Turan didn't know whether to run into the corner and keep the ball or actually attack the goal. I think Deschamps wanted him to protect the ball and go into the corner with only a couple of minutes left. But the speed of that run from Mbappe through the middle, off the ball. I mean, he was greased lightning. France with Turemene, just keeping possession. The Coleman now turns, and he sets off towards the penalty area. Step over there, pulls it across, stretching away from Nelson, and he was fortunate there in that he was off-balance, but he was able to find a teammate, and Denmark cleared the halfway line. Deschamps' substitution has worked, you know, and Coleman on that right-hand side. Dembele was looking a little bit tired, so he takes him off and puts Coleman on the other side. He just had that added bit of pace back into the game, and it's worked perfectly. And Denmark conceded a free kick just in front of Kasper Huland, who, incredibly, he's put a jacket on Kasper Huland. But they do say it on, they're down at pitch level. It can be quite chilly with all of those vents around the ground, so he's obviously feeling it down there. But France are nearly there into the last 16, and who would bet against them? Even with all of the big-name absentees going a long, long way, the defending champions at this World Cup, trying to become the first team since Brazil to successfully defend the World Cup. That was back in 1962, winners in 58 and 62. So 60 years since any team has lifted two consecutive World Cup trophies. Ball for Denmark, played foot at the edge of the box, and it has to be headed away by Theo Hernandez. And he does so, and it's out of play. We've had some very, very late goals at this World Cup, so we're not ruling anything out. Alexander Bar is going to take this, and he's actually walked and backed right up against the advertising hoardings. Lots of white shirts in the French penalty area. This might be their last chance. We're in the seventh minute of added time. Long, long throw from Bar. Nelson tried to flick it on. It comes out further shot from Mélan, the left wing back. He snatched at it, bounced up the waist height, and he's got right underneath it and ballooned it over the top of the crossbar. He's done France a right favour there, hasn't he? I can't believe he's attempted that from that far out. It just needed to be helped back into the box to keep the pressure on France, but he put it 20, 30 yards over the bar. Thanks very much, Laurie says. It was a real floater, I think it came down just to go with that Danish flag that says what looks the worst is Spenge. But I guess it's Spender in Denmark. And that's it. There's no time for Laurie to take the goal kick. That is it. The match is over. France have won it with two goals from Kylian and Bate. Denmark are left with one point from two matches and are struggling. They're up against it to get through. But France don't have such worries. Two wins out of two and the defending champions are through. They'll be in the last 16. Alan Shearer. They've looked very good again, particularly in forward areas. Griezmann, Korman, Dambelle and of course that guy and Bapé. What a player, what a superstar. He made the difference tonight. They were asked the question when Denmark got back into the game and got the equaliser. What have you got? They make a couple of changes, Deschamps does and they work and they work perfectly. When you've got that guy and that team and Bapé and the form that he's in, he looks so comfortable, so confident in front of goal and everything that he's doing, you've got a chance. He won the game for them. France six points out of six, then Australia with three, Denmark with one, Tunisia with one. So that's going to be quite a match. Denmark against Australia on the final night of this group on Wednesday. But France can celebrate. The celebrations are quite muted. Not in the stands, all of the trickleers are being waved there by the French fans and they are now going over to them. They'll be able to do whatever they like when it comes to the final match, Didier Deschamps. That is the luxury. That's what England wanted last night. Meanwhile, the Danish squad are all gathered round with Casper Hulman and you can tell, Thor to already being sent forward to that match against Australia. Final score though here in stadium 974, France two, Denmark one. And it's back to Mark Chapman.
