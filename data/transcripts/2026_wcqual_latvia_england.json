  "transcript": " Roger Gordon and Harry Kane and they are all in white as Latvia in their carmine red with a little bit of orange and white will be playing from left to right as the Greek referee who is Tassos city Popoulos Is about to get us underway with England knowing that they are three points away from achieving Welcome qualification Cape bird last night became the 19th different side You have to go back to Japan who were the first to qualify back in March Portugal and England could be the first European sides to do it tonight and England know that three points a Straight away it goes down field from Pickford launches the ball long towards Harry Kane on the edge of the area and picked up by the White shirts the all white of England playing from left to right This is where Thomas Tuchel is set his stall out He wants to have that intensity Physicality and to swarm all over Latvia As Lewis Skelly slides the ball in towards rice Gordon on this left-hand side back towards rice in England Looking to settle into an early group and this one floats the ball forward and it's not going to Harry Kane That's it Harry Kane at the far post just guiding it in with his left foot It was inside 45 seconds ruled out for offside Was a lovely pass from Elliott Anderson not enough pressure on the ball from Latvia is clearly offside I mean the linesman keeps his flag down to a quite late, but They're gonna have to have good movement around the area because I'm looking at the setup of Latvia I mean it's a 5-4-1 really that there's just gonna be players Banked everywhere across the middle of the pitch and tight line. So it's gonna require Shifting them about and moving the ball quickly and maybe some adventurous passes Rice wins the ball Anderson place it back concert Into the center circle in the England half Spence out towards Sacker on that right-hand side. Sacker gives it back towards Spence Now it's with John Stones Thomas Tuchel who's made his way across the athletics track watching on Being serenaded by the England supporters. I think he was so focused on the game He was unaware that they were actually singing his name Biggest biggest technical area you've ever seen that I'm just a little so five a side pitching it is. Yeah You can understand why the Latvian players don't like playing here in terms of the atmosphere because you just completely Detached aren't you as a player? Yeah, you know No stand on the far side without the trees here is that stones And already England have every outfield player in the Latvia half a way towards our left-hand side Spence rolls it forward looking to try and get Sacker in behind Sigan Yix who is Making his 59th consecutive appearance for the Latvian national side tonight which actually is A joint record So it's in a ground which is a three-minute drive from his childhood home And he equals the record also set by Andres Rubins between 1999 and 2004 However, if he picks up a yellow card tonight He will not be able to extend that record because he's one of seven players if they pick up a yellow card would be suspended for their Final qualification game, which is a way to serve yet next month So he'll need to be on his best behavior Rogers That was a nice turn and he looked for the ball through the middle for Gordon He does that well doing Morgan Rogers really love the way he takes the ball and turns all in one motion You've got to have such good head movement to do that He checks and scans constantly before the ball comes He knows his surroundings and he's so smooth the way he takes that first touch Really does have an impact because he gets his head up and he's straight at the back for certainly when you know Both those banks of midfield and the defensive Latvia is so condensed. I enjoyed the the pre-match chat with Kelly and Connor and yourself but when Connor was highlighting Morgan Rogers, I couldn't agree more with him You know, we expecting Bellingham, but it says everything about Morgan Rogers, you know In the space of 11 months he's been involved in every game for England 10 successive games now where he's been involved Whether he's come off the bench or started And I think that Thomas Tuchel is a huge huge admirer of the Aston Villa player as the ball is Chipped out towards this near side. They were looking for Ytowskis down the line it goes looking to give chase Was that was batman? They've made three Changes from the side that drew 2-2 with Andorra on Saturday as Vedris is in goal you've got Vykes Tchernomordis and Balodis as their three central defenders Siganyik's and Ytowskis on the wing backs Vaslavans, Vapne, Zelenkovs in the centre of midfield with the Kanyiks just behind Goodkowskis who leads the line as Latvia are gonna do a Lot of defending in this game a lot of chasing Eventually you would think those legs would tire a sack of rolls it in towards Rogers with his back to go Couldn't roll away from his mark a sack of tries to win it back England go hunting for the ball over on that right hand side And in the end it was the Kanyiks is the player who's got a try and dig the ball out But England are all over them. They just can't get out that and the ball is played through here Is Rogers with a shot right foot it blocked on the edge of the area This is what Thomas Tuchel wants to see from his players I think certainly the regaining of possession once you lose it is a noticeable shift with England Their reaction three or four players nearest the ball really go after it for at least three to four seconds Just to see if they can win it straight back Makes it very hard for Latvia to get any passes out of that back area of the pitch. I mean It just about got away with it there and came through with the ball, but it's gonna be hard for them There's a poor result for them at home here wasn't it? It was a stand or a yeah, so the confidence wise me to concede two goals in that It's not great. No, England are attacking Saka weaves his way in towards the penalty area and the ball then is cleared away by Boss Slavons on the at the edge of the area it goes out for an England throw bizarrely That was the first time that they'd actually scored Two goals in a game under Paulo Nicolao their Italian coach First time in 17 games that they'd scored Two goals and it came against the might of Andorra This fence for England midway through the Latvian half England fans of boisterous Gonna damp cold Day in Riga as Gordon head the ball towards Lewis Skelly and then the ball is gonna be brought away by Latvia on this near side that the ball from Boss Slavons couldn't get it in field now Harry Kane picks it up He's got Gordon on his left hand side Gordon towards the penalty area crosses and Harry Kane puts it wide and I've got to say Harry Kane those sort of type of chances you would think he would bury Well, I think any chance you expect him to bury that's the kind of form he's in Didn't hit the target that time those good play from Gordon It really was he kind of fell to Kane had a little bit of space drove at the back for slipped it wide to Gordon makes his run into the box and for me just looking at the replay Certainly achievable for him to hit the target and he kind of looks up to the sky almost thinking Alva missed that it really was Aside for into the back of the net and Thomas Tuchel's reaction as well Certainly says that Was one of real shock on the face of the Thomas Tuchel for Harry Kane who scored 19 goals in 12 games for club and country this season He's already had an early goal this allowed He could easily have put England ahead inside the seventh minute Bearing in mind England had to wait until the 38th minute to break the deadlock against Latvia back in March But all of a sudden the ball a heisted towards the penalty area The cost is couldn't control it in comes the cross He was excited there from the Latvian support as in front of us There's a Shriek as that cross came in from Yakov skis on this near side the right But in the end there was no real threat to Jordan Pickford scores He looks to extend his own record of eight successive clean sheets as a good header from stones defensively It was a great ball in wasn't it from Yakov skis really whipped it with a bit of pace, but Stones was in a great position just to flick it away Lewis Kelly goes down the line Gordon and with a second time for England that he's had three successive starts The last was 13 months ago He's never gone for on the spin for England But he's got a chance to impress as the Newcastle play it left hand side of the penalty area center in the left footed cross So Gagnik's heads it away drops towards Anderson tries to get it out towards Saka blocked comes out towards Spence He runs away and finds now the Arsenal player midway through the Latvian half nine minutes play BBC radio Five live also live on the BBC sounds out World Cup qualification game here and Lewis Kelly just took his eye off the ball It went away from him. It'll go out for a Latvia throw It's been a promising start as in it in a fixture that can be difficult in terms of just having to break down the team That's gonna sit deep but two good chances already. It should be one that up really I mean Harry Kane you would expect him to hit the target and Anthony Gordons look quite bright on the left hand side Putting a good couple of crosses into the box already Yacoscus is taking his time with the throw so a looping throw on this near side Latvia playing from Left to right as we look but England have it now and it was with Spence short ball push to the feet there of Saka Spence will go on the overlap and quickly that Pass from Saka fine Spence back to the Arsenal player here is concert bright orange boots on this damp night in the Latvian capital Gordon once again on the left comes on the inside about 25 yards out from goal and Anderson no width at the minute because sacchar had come just to the right corner of the box He had to move back outside and once again Spence goes on the overlap Here is Saka looks to try and thread the ball through blocked comes back to Saka shoots left-footed blocked It'll rebound out towards Spence his first time cross-texan deflection Also Lewis Skelly who tried to strike it wouldn't necessarily sit took out Boss 11 the Latvia midfielder in the process Saka though now has it his crosses a deep one And it's headed up in the air by Yacoscus and then the effort on the half volley is fired in by Elliot Anderson and it was right put it in screwed well over the top this Portugal nil Hungary won is The latest score in group F and that means that it's a setback for Portugal's hopes of Qualification tonight they had to win and hope that our main I mean you fail to win against the Republic of Ireland However, they're not even up holding their side of the bargain Because they have fallen behind Portugal nil Hungry one is a latest score Matt Upsett well at the moment this game is just feeling like You know when will England score not if doesn't it? I mean it's just got that feel to have started very well There's good movement off the ball which you have to have Jed Spence going on lots of overlaps to try and stretch the play Lewis Skelly getting supportive and You know England looking like any moment if they find the right pass or the right cross They're gonna put the ball in the back of the net Here is sir Louis Skelly coming in off the left touch line Gordon goes out to the to the touch line looks to go on the outside of Yacoscus delivers the cross as well So Gagnix is there to head it away inside the penalty area picked up though by Spence England They're still looking to try and keep the tempo keep the pressure on Latvia pass the ball out quickly Stones towards Gordon early ball into the penalty area and Try to be kept alive by Rogers, but it goes behind eventually for a goal kick They seem to have moved on you know when they played well Indeed Latvia and Andorra and there was them stodgy performances. Yes, they were passing the ball slowly They were struggling to break down teams with a low block They've now got an urgency about themselves and his last two and a bit cage. It's not stodgy is it definitely not at all It's quite sharp. It's bright. There's movement. I love the fact that Rogers and Or rice are always arriving in the box when the balls wide with a full back or with Gordon or Saka to cross it One of those is making that run right into the heart of the box Here is Harry Kane inside. He finds Rogers Saka is to his right edge of the penalty area enters the box now balls stuck to his left foot Clips it across towards Lewis Skelly sits up for Lewis Skelly hits it left-footed down into the ground And then in the end he plays the ball back towards concept in England and maintaining their dominance and their control in this game in 13 minutes Spencer game will come on the overlap. They're looking for that sort of As it's Saka's cross comes shot sales over the goal and out for a goal kick They're wanting the full backs to be aggressive to get forward to be attacking And certainly Spencer's is doing that on the right-hand side is and when he does that He just takes that little bit of attention from the defender because the last thing you want to allow Saka do like we saw against Wales on Thursday has come inside on his left foot I mean his pinpoint the way he picks out the far post and whips it with his left foot So he's just trying to create that bit of confusion spent We're you know, I mean he might make ten of those runs and get the ball once but it just creates that half a yard for Saka To us to come this occasion did acknowledge the England supporters who filled the four segments of that Terras that is elevated away towards our right-hand side with a thumbs up as Harry Kane Nice little play by England Lewis Skelly. We talk about the full backs getting forward He was the most advanced England shirt there on the edge of the penalty area and they almost slipped him in too We always looks the likely to get in the box doesn't he every time he plays Lewis Skelly He's got that kind of confidence to go forward amazing confidence for such a young player Ball given away interception for Anderson here for England still 0-0 on five live and the BBC sounds out We've been playing for nearly a quarter of an hour This here now is Declan Rice Rice out towards Gordon Lewis Skelly first time cross swept over from the left But it goes out of play for a goal kick and more like football tomorrow on five live women's Champions League coverage Chelsea against Paris and the Premier League returns on Saturday five live sport from midday Manchester City against Everton The three o'clock commentary and the usual goal service full and Arsenal at 5 30 Crystal Palace Bournemouth incidentally will be our sports extra offering at three and then on Sunday Tottenham Aston Villa at two and Liverpool Manchester United the small matter of The commentary at half past four so there the games look forward to as the Premier League returns This is a World Cup qualifier where it remains Latvia nil England nil John Stones strokes it in field concert Two out to his right-hand side Spence again on the overlap Saka plays him in sliding across This ball odys and it will go out for an England throw that they take quickly And it's Saka concert Stones now as well Ball reaches Gordon on this near side comes in field hits it curling And he's got too much underneath that it was always going over the top and it runs away off the athletics track And goes right up against the metal fence underneath that elevated stand Left hand side It's been another good start from Elliott Anderson in this game. He's got such a good instinct of reading Where to be to pick up a loose parcel to apply pressure to someone's first touch he really I don't know whether That's just a natural sense that he has but It's certainly a great asset to have in the middle of pitch and again makes it That little bit harder to find a place in that midfield for any players coming in because he's just dominating that part of pitch at the moment Anderson plays it to Saka Saka chips over the cross from the right Latvia will try And it was a foul by Lewis Skelly And that will be a free kick to Latvia. It was on boss slavums who Played now in 14 of the last 16 internationals for Latvia Just an accidental trip and it'll offer a little bit of respite because it's been a Difficult 17 minutes hasn't it for Latvia to try and keep England at bay Can't be too much fun. Can it just running around Dropping in filling in tracking back making tackles and when you get the ball They're not managing to keep possession at all They've got a little bit of the ball back right now at the left back position But look at the pressure from England everyone all the white shirts pushed all the way in not allowing any space and just forced the error the ball out of play and then they're locking into players again. It's a really Discipline start from England Daniels Bologna's who was relegated with with st. Johnston is actually left Scotland now and moved to Slovakia in the in the summer Was the player who was able to clear it comes to this near side for Yakovsky's Declan Reiser wins it back for England as Jordan Tickford comes into my eye line all in green Still to be as vocal just for him to keep that levels of concentration just to shout to the players That's how he maintains his Concentration and he's gonna be a mere spectator tonight just a question of winning in score When can they break down this lap the inside nil nil? Spence Anderson got time to have a little glance over his left shoulder 18 minutes play looks very very comfortable load as Anderson always makes himself available Spence gives it away picked up now by the low striker because this And he is fouled and that will be a free kick as Turkey are leading Georgia by a goal to nil in group E Turkey won Georgia nil Turkey trying to keep pace with Spain at the top of Group E as Latvia go back to their goalkeepers Vedris Intercepted though by Declan Rice here is Anthony Gordon moving into a central area the layoff by Rogers almost got Harry Kane in but straight away Rogers goes in pursuit of the ball He doesn't think all didn't quite come off his first instinct is there to go chase after the Latvian defense That's the reaction you want the reaction Thomas Tuchels looking for it was it nice layoff as well tough to get the perfect angle Wasn't it came into it really just try to cushion it one touch into the path of Kane But you're right the reaction was super to go and press and force the error to win the ball back Anderson again doing the the industry the hard work in the midfield and then wanting the ball off Jordan pick As concert Comes to the midway point of his own half and takes it short from from pickford As we hear Latvian voices for the first time here in Riga tonight that Gordon goes on the outside down towards the byline Gordon keeps the ball in play and pulls it back sack of shoots blocks But the back in the back the flag is up on the far side. He had actually gone out anyway It'll be a goal kick to where to lack of a Gordon looks lively He does is going out of defender every time goes past him rides a second challenge Just doesn't manage to keep the ball in as he crosses it But he's looked to be very direct Anthony Gordon He's not had a brilliant season in terms of Impact numbers of goals and assists has he for new cars certainly not in the Premier League is not really carrying too much punch in terms of defining moments in matches, but You just always know what you get from him Don't know his application of work rate and attitude is spot-on which always does create that foundation for you as a player I was given a score by our producer Gary. I thought I remembered it I rolled it up the score and sent over the cross and then I've had to unravel it because I actually forgotten what it was and it's and Dora are leading Serbia by a goal to nail in England's group That gives you an indication of how much Serbia in disarray and Dora leading 1-0 Dora flying like two goals away from home Oh, yeah now a homie Serbia one That was their their first point in group K as well. I can't believe you screwed that result up The memories not what it used to be There's a mountain of paper now starts to just gather in the desk between you and me Matt 21 minutes play mill mill It was actually Serbia's inability To to beat Albania that defeats that meant that the three points could secure qualification for the World Cup for England tonight with those Games that were played on Saturday England of course have played two days previously without friendly against Wales as Anderson Thomas Tuchel desperate for Spence to get forward looks for the cross for Harry Kane It was The captain was headed behind the lead by the way didn't last long I can rip that one up with confidence as Serbia have equalized and Dora one Serbia one elsewhere in group K England They'll have a corner kick and Declan Rice is going to take it This is big as well for me having a team because you don't get a lot of time to work together on an international stage But having good set pieces when you come into a major tournament is is massive So England working on that and having a plan which they have is being tresting see how this corner takes out Declan Rice with his right foot Declan Rice swings it over from that far side the right Flicks away by the head of Jordan Moody's picked back up by Anderson and now it is with that with stones And stones will run in field. He'll pass the ball back out towards Rice and stayed right corner the area Saccharis behind him Spence is central at the moment This is Morgan Rogers Rogers delivers the cross and Latvia defense deal with it So we'll be way through the first half it is goal is here on five live and to take you through the half time It's that correspondent John. Thank you Ian. Yes. It's good a real FA cup field to it This match here in this setting in the capital of Latvia Riga the Dalgava stadium, which is named after the the wide river that flows through the city As England attack Spencer's cross from the right-hand side say England attack That's all that's happened during the match so far. It's a tag against defense and here is Gordon now Anthony Gordon Gives it to Harry Kane the captain fit again after his bruised foot then Miles Lewis Scully turns tries to give it back to Kane but there are too many Maroon and orange shirts inside the Latvia penalty area and in the end actually England winner for a cake Anderson's bundled over Gordon now plays it infield Kane 30 yards out plays it square Spencer's there now out to Sacher on the right-hand side and the green boots after he scored One of the goals on Thursday night is first since the Euro Sacher and then into the edge of the penalty area Half cleared away comes back Elliot Anderson Elliot Anderson now Lewis Scully his left foot across right across the penalty area and then it's bounced down and and should be dealt with by C Gannick's but he hasn't Done that and it's actually had us play open for a throwing to England relentless man It is relentless and Thomas Tuchel right at the edge of his technical area I can tell he's getting a little bit edgy in terms of England have really controlled in this game But they've not made that breakthrough yet, and I think he's feeling a little bit Just anxious as if to say if he feels his team maybe should have one goal Already, but they haven't and they've just got to keep probing keep working keep trying to break down This Latvia team that are just sat Right back and they're saying come on then break us down Matthew Upton with us on 5-5 Went to the World Cup with England Connor Cody's in the studio with Kelly Kates We'll hear from Conor at halftime another England World Cup man as Anthony Gordon Christ to win a corner for England, but it bounced back onto him and behind for a goal kick Yes, I'm not sure how Harry Kane missed that chance that he had when it was Swept in from the left-hand side by Anthony Gordon The contact was as clean as can be but it was inches wide at the foot of the post very uncained like Doesn't it I have to say those are normally Absolute precision. Yeah, and he just gets it wrong hits it through the near post. Maybe gets hits it too clean John Yeah, Harry Kane missed the match on Thursday That was the first match the only match that he's not started under the management of Thomas Tuchel this to calls eight Match in charge Portugal have equalised against Hungary. It's Cristiano Ronaldo with his 142nd international goal and Turkey now to nail up on Georgia in the In the Spain group still Spain mill Bulgaria nil and here is one for Gordon It's a longer past this time Latria did actually venture downfield so Gordon now there's a little bit of space cuts in field right for charges Anthony Gordon opens the scoring for England In the 26th minute and the Latvian Resistance is broken by the Newcastle United man who scores his second goal for England nicely done as well On his right foot a law shot into the far bottom corner, and it is Latvia near England one He deserves that Anthony Gordon for how he started the game He's been really positive and progressive and he gets his reward after say though John Stones plays a huge part in this goal He literally gets the ball and he points his finger and looks at Gordon and says go on Just go in behind but we can keep playing into feet and having to break him down you get behind He chips the ball over the top lovely ball Gordon skips onto it drops his shoulder cuts in past two defenders And it's just a lovely placed precise side foot where he bends the ball with his right foot Curling around the goalkeeper into the far post perfect finish lovely move from England simple There's been lots of intricate little bits of play that was really simple But straight to the point and they get their reward But that was one of the few occasions where England Stones was able to play a pass like that because I said I had ventured downfield. Yes, that's right That attack concert cuts it out the ball pops to stones But you know we talked about how influential he is and the Conocoady mentioned it before the game about what he brings That was just real leadership if I'm honest because he's got the ball at his feet He wants to put it in there and he puts his finger up and looks Gordon in the eye across the pitch and says to get yourself in behind and he's got the quality to find the right way to pass and Anthony Gordon Finished it brilliantly he started very well on this left-hand side for England Yes, he did. I thought he played well against Wales as well on Thursday night And he's had a little bit of a wait for his second England goal, but there it is It's come as Latvia do push forward with your Koskis on the right-hand side Gets the cross into the box and that's cleared away by John Stones on the volley and it bounces out of play just down in front of us We've got a running track around the pitch here But it is wide open this stadium and actually the forecast was for very strong winds tonight blowing in off the Baltic Just like they had here against Andorra on Saturday when the match finished 2-2 And they had to scrap the plans to have an arch on the field before the match because they thought it was going to blow away But the the strong winds haven't Realized forecast wrong John and you actually forced me to pop into a shop and buy a willy hat this afternoon Yes, that was 20 euros wasted a little serve you well though Here's your Koskis down the right-hand side plays the ball in and bounces up and onto Konza and England are able to clear it away vast slavans in the penalty area Got contact on that but I think down into the ground up onto Konza and England clear There's a handball appeal as well off of Konza who had his arms down by his side But like we've seen in these competitions in European or international football They do like a dodgy handball decision But I don't think anything's come of it But nice move from that. We actually good ball in a good good runners into the box. They actually committed men forwards Yeah, they did and you know this It had to be an improvement after what happened here on Saturday when a great deal went wrong for Latvia Their coach Paolo Nicolato was saying to us yesterday He said there are you said there are lovely lovely group of players. They said they're nice lads. Actually, they're too nice I'd like them to be to be bad guys against England tonight Well, they've got a corner after that So it's their first corner of the match and there's lots of movement in the box Here it is delivered at the near post and it's headed away by Harry Kane for England and then Saka stretch and got a touch to it But it's out of play and Latvia having their best spell of the match the backdrop though. You can hear it 2700 England fans are in that stand to our right which is all alone there in In splendid isolation these two stands that are sort of raised up above the ground probably 1015 feet by concrete tellers and the England fans are in there in great numbers here and And they'll be enjoying the England performance so far tonight the goal from Anthony Gordon and I'm sure they'll have enjoyed their time in this Really attractive city that we find ourselves first time. I've been here for over a quarter of a century I've forgotten how nice it is and beautiful in autumn as well and Latvia With the boys the Lenkovs plays it up to it It can't it's who is trying to take it around the outside But Jed Spencer's able to get the ball from it going out and then that was a that was a sturdy challenge From a Tigan Yix actually on him and he just knocked the ball away It's he can't it's dive day in court spends and we'll just have to see if he's okay. I think he's gonna be okay Well, he's the exact play that didn't need a book in today's den I was already mentioned earlier on he was on for a record wasn't he he's got a bit he must have been yellow card It's that yeah, you got the yellow card straight out. Yeah, yeah, it was out too quick John I think the yellow car was out before The player had hit the ground I mean, it was a bad tackle. He really does launch in catches him quite badly and it's a shame because That record he was going for he won't be able to achieve now. No, well, he's equal bit It's a Latvia record for consecutive appearances For the the men's international team 59 matches, but as Ian pointed out earlier, he will not be able to play against Serbia away next month in What will be their final qualifier so England leading by one goal to nil This is the scoreline that will confirm England's place at the World Cup Next summer but only one nil and Latvia have been much better since they conceded the goals strangely They've had to try and come out and here they are now in possession again on the halfway line the maroon and white colors of the Latvia national flag as well as bits of orange in there as well in England all in Pristine white tonight really standing out on this dank damp evening here just outside the The Riga city centre must have the pitch looks good though John it does yeah the balls Both teams no issues with the pitch at all. No dodgy bounces. It's actually being moved nice and quickly and Pretty flush along the surface. See it is the national athletics stadium of Latvia as well as Vars slab and carries the ball in from the right-hand side But Jed Spence who has recovered he's shaken off that heavy tackle from see Ganyek She's able to pull you away Play near the halfway line Latvia nil England one if you just switched on to us on BBC radio 5 live Listen to 5 live on the BBC sounds app as well as the balls played over the top But right wing back your coaches can't keep that in play and it's out for a throw to England Football pages of the BBC sport website Phil McNulty and Sammy mock bell will be writing on this match and and if it stays like this on what happens next for England in terms of The path towards the World Cup finals next summer Tony Livesey's on five lives Tonight from 1030. So whatever Reaction that we can bring you here We will do on five lives sport that it might well spill into Tony's program as it did last week Although I think England are looking to make a quick exit here tonight with with these players involved in matches at the weekend And it's a long flight back two and a half hours or so here's stones in possession just at the left of the Center circle across to Elliot Anderson two hours ahead of UK time here in the Baltic Nations First time England the senior men's team have played here a new destination For England and leading through that Anthony Gordon goal he was talking in the in the build-up to this match Anthony Gordon how he feels as though his performance is so far for England I think he rated himself at 50% He wanted to be better and he has impressed in these two matches And he's on the score sheet with his first goal for England since last November when he scored in the 5-0 win against Republic of Ireland Ball played by Anderson the cane on the left-hand side Cane goes for goal took an affliction which took it right across the penalty area and then a stretch and a head away by Tigan Yix Out of play for a throw down the right-hand side I think it's a it's a lovely quirk that there's brilliant goal scoring season for Harry Kane yet again You know he scored against all and sundry Scoring his last seven appearances for club and country the last team that he failed to score against was Andora It's a corner to England actually did bounce out of play just the other side of the corner flag So another set-piece chance How effective they were Scoring two of the goals in the aftermath of corners against Wales on Thursday Right standing with his hands on his hips now waiting to take this players clustered around the penalty spot And that's where the ball goes the text a flick off a Latvian head comes out to Elliott Anderson puts his foot on it But wanted too much time actually and he was closed down by good cops kids who has just Taken a knock in that challenge and he stayed down and Latvia put the ball out of play and I think he'll Receive some treatment. I think you got the brunt of Elliott Anderson's follow-through of that attempted shot He wanted the ball to come down. He was trying to Just put his foot through it from quite long range. It's good pressure from good good cost this and he's rubbing that right thigh Quite intensely Continued the number nine thirty years old actually plays in South Korea for Dave John Hannah citizen he's got a trip home He has We complain about it to an hour go halfway across the world. Yes stones now to Esri Konza no mark gay in the team tonight. He is on the bench though He's okay, but you're a crystal palace fan. Don't worry the balls play away by Latvia towards up towards good coughs Kids who seems okay, but he's out muscle Dispossessed by Esri Konza good management of that situation with Gary John I think so yeah consider it isn't it and across everything I Think that is an interesting decision and one that you know a lot of managers may not have made but I Think that's quite clever. Well crystal palace captain 12 matches. Yeah, I thought at all of the matches Yeah, the palace in all competitions. He has Gordon on the left hand side place the ball in right across the six yard box And I'm not sure how anyone didn't get a touch on that whether Attacker or defender and in the end Latvia were able to take possession and clear it away And Spain have taken the lead against Bulgaria and it's Mikhail Marino of Arsenal He has rice of Arsenal now to Gordon Gordon in the area goes for a little shot The defender was in front of him just trying to be cute with that didn't he yeah And they're saying that it took a deflection England and they're wanting a corner and the referee Does not agree? Tassos Siddiro Opelous and says it is good. I don't think there's a touch on that from when I see the slow mo but Anthony Gordon He is enjoying himself on this left-hand side really good quality into the box again and Harry Kane who's been slightly held In the box by by Balodis Couldn't quite get away from his marker because if he did it's just a tap in at the far post really good play from Gordon Well Latvia very nearly gave it away there, but They had to be sharp because Gordon was after it but it was cleared away on the edge of the box and And then there's a foul on Elliot Anderson Turkey and have three nil up on Georgia So both Turkey and Spain winning in that group group a Spain three points clear at the top of that section Portugal like England could qualify tonight, but they're one-one with Hungary and Republic of Ireland nil Armenia nil in the other match in that group Dublin So Anderson now up to Saka Saka who's in the middle of the Latvia half, but he's been forced away To and actually gives it to Anderson who curls it into the box and a stretching half in half clearance for Latvia bounces down now over there to the far side to Tegan Yix who's looking to work it away, which he does but it just gives possession back to England 38 minutes played here in Riga England winning one nil They've dominated it and Kane's gonna have a shot from distance that's 25 yards plus But with his left foot pulls it well wider the post and bounces into the advertising Hordens to the right of the goal as he looks at it There's a nice bit of kind of interchanging amongst that front five really because I'll include Declan Rice in that whereas Kane Sometimes dropping out that time Anthony Gordon and made it all the way into the far post of the box Sometimes Saka's making it inside. There's a lot of nice movement between that whole front section of the team Really working off each other and balancing out if somebody goes in there then then Kane's dropping out or or Rice might hold Or then he might get in the box. He's got a nice Balance to it at the moment Thomas Tuchel just making two changes tonight The fewest number of changes match to match that that he's made so far in England five wins out of five in the group yet to Concedigal and At the moment getting the score line They need to qualify for the World Cup tonight with two matches to spare England with it on the edge of the box Rogers tries to play it in there That's cleared away up towards the the far side where all of those trees a line of trees with a slight autumn tinge to them All the way along that side of the ground and then these massive black rectangular video screen which is held up By two gray columns and absolutely dominates that side of the Pitch and I mean that they're playing a live feed of the game. I mean, it's just big TV screen You can watch it on you can inside the ground huge gray floodlight pylons. They are industrial They're the star of the show The best I've ever seen here's Saka on the right-hand side claims He was fouled referee agrees and pulls out another yellow card for that challenge on Bukhaeo Saka and a free kick for England in a good position. Yeah, great position this referee Getting the yellow card out again, but Saka just hovering over the ball. It's right in that position around the corner About five yards outside of the 18-yard box and he didn't like the reaction of The Latvian player. I think it was fellow this year went to ground and just kicked through the side of Saka Not too short. It's a yellow card though. Jennifer Moniz looking at the tackle. Yeah Hooked his right foot around a little card in it. It was a little he's not one of the The raft of Latvian players who came into this match one yellow card away from a suspension but really this defeat if it is to be a defeat means that Their most remote of opportunities are qualifying for the World Cup will have gone Saka then with this Free kick over there on the right-hand side He's going to play it in left-footed, but a leap and a header away by Sigan Yix comes back to Saka then it's worked in field to Anderson Four minutes to go to halftime England still leading through just the one goal Anthony Gordon, but could easily have had a couple more Elliot Anderson four caps now started the last four matches yours all already Almost feels like a part of the furniture It's unheard of to have to have your first four caps and you start all four games. He is right That's a good-looking Paul into the box. He whipped it in right for it headed away though Well defended Harry Kane now to the edge of the box and then Anderson and then a Ribona pass from Miles Lewis Skelly into the box that was half cleared away Rogers is over on the left-hand side and he Receives it back Morgan Rogers of Aston Deller into the box now the chance for Anderson with the shot across the face of gold But why do the far post from the angle slashed at it a little and hit it across the face of gold? I think that's the right phrase a little bit of a snatched effort from Anderson there just Found himself in space picked up a lovely position good pass from Rogers sees him in wraps the ball into him a little bit Frantic in the finish and he walks away kind of gesturing to himself as if to say needed a little bit more calmness and finesse on that finish but Again another midfield player having the balance and the intelligence to get into the right area in the box England find the pass and create a chance and done that well in his first half that via loss again Kane plays it through into the penalty area for Rice but goalkeeper The address does well actually anticipate about well quickly out of his six-yard box and grasp it at the feet of Declan Rice So Need to make a little note matter that chance for Anderson. Yeah across the face of goal and I mean a great noise coming out of that stand as England come forward again. Can't let the shot there It is it's 2-0 and Harry Kane scores from inside the D Typical came as he fell struck it perfectly Goalkeeper diving down to his right couldn't get there and came scores yet again for England 75 Goals now to extend his record and it's Latvia near England to Alice Latvia trying to play out They get caught out the ball rebounds into Harry Kane And it's the last person on the pitch that you want the ball to come to in this area takes it on his left foot Drifts inside into that D on the edge of the 18-yard box And it's a fantastic finish with his left foot. I mean left foot right foot head any kind of finish That's a brilliant finish technically is leaning John So all these body weights coming on to the ball He puts a nice bit of shape gets good contact with his left foot Bit of curve on it bouncing with pace into the bottom corner Fantastic finish on your left foot from that position. I mean that is world-class and you just cannot Allow the ball to bounce to him in that kind of situation is absolutely lethal. Yeah, I feel like I've seen him score that Yeah No, but but it's either foot, isn't it? Yeah, that's the impressive thing He's got the quality to be that precise with either foot. I mean it's top stuff And that's from that's from years of working dedication and making Self as good with each foot so two-nil race with across now to the back post that's headed down by Kane And it's blocked on the edge of the six-yard area. He headed it down into the ground And it was deflected Up and wide of the goal for an England corner. Yeah, but body language of the Latvian players has gone And I think that this this could be a very challenging Second half for Latvia if they don't come out with a slightly better Persona about I'm England just completely dominating this game And look like they could score at will at the moment It's actually a decent save wasn't it? Yeah, it was a good because it bounced right in front of the goalkeeper as Kane heads it down It hits the turf and he's got to save it kind of on the way up But he did and he pushed it away wide. He was at fault for one of the Andorra goals Sviatris at the weekend Well, here's the corner and they are crowding the goalkeeper and in it comes in see address does well He gets his right arm to it under severe pressure there Defenders attackers It was a packed six-yard area and the goalkeeper did well on the stretch to hook it away So we are one minute of added time Harry Kane's scored again for England as I say 75 goals now This is his 110th appearance his fifth on the list of most appearances and he's setting a target here Harry Kane the age of 32 now that very likely won't be caught for Nearly decades and decades and decades and here's Rice carrying the ball forward, but referee's spotted an infringement and he stopped play What is happening here? He's walking across to as recon that and he's actually going to the screen So this I'm guessing this could be a penalty for England was this from the corner. Is it from? potentially because I mean that the corner I was like was absolutely whether not VA I've taken some time to find some kind of holding a fence Yeah, well the drama player it the amnesian splendid isolation the referee over there on the pressure over there Unless the trees are going to get onto him and the suggestion is that that Kane was shoved over by his opposite number I don't know the penalties given and Yellow cards coming out for Anthony's chain of Mordes as well who shoved over Harry Kane I think he did I think I shot I think Kane Kains bought that one I'm not sure about VA are getting involved in that. I mean if the referee gives it on field You'd expect Them to kind of have a good look at it But I'm not sure there was quite enough from what I only saw a briefing a brief Slow-mo, but it looked like Kane was more than happy to feel the contact and go go down to the floor And suddenly the heavens have opened as Harry Kane picks himself open is preparing to take this We've got we've got Baltic rain coming straight down On the on the pitch and Harry Kane just steps away But then actually comes back again and re spots the ball. So Harry Kane. This is his 28th penalty for England England's number nine to make it 3-0 and surely put the outcome beyond out with his right foot He sends the goalkeeper the wrong way It's 3-0 to England Kane scored two of them and this score line is going to take England to the World Cup in 2026 there's little doubt of that now even though it's still not half-time Latvia nail England 3. Yeah I mean when the second goal went in Latvia absolutely just body language collapsed and Yeah, they've not had a good five minutes I mean, I think it's more holding on the penalty than anything. There's a big grab of the shirt from Cherno Mordis Which I think then came false to the floor But I'm not sure the grab of the shirt forced the drop to the floor But Harry Kane taking no prisoners with that penalty bottom Corner to the goalkeepers right Straight with power into the side of the net brilliant penalty and they half-time whistle has gone and England are in complete Charge of this World Cup qualifier Latvia nail England 3 and you know what as well Harry Kane that this will be the This will be the the sixth major tournament World Cup European Championship that he'll have been to and he when England have clinched Qualification for the previous five Kane has scored in every single one of those matches and he's got two here tonight He and England have been unstoppable that yeah, just phenomenal golf scorer that he is I mean he should have a hat trick really which tells you how good England have been I mean Latvia haven't put up that much of a fight they had to go first 15-20 minutes But the moment the first goal went in they've not given a good account of themselves, but England have done well I have to say they've got good movement good balance, you know the players look hungry the physicalities there The directness is there it's been it's been a very good away performance so far So that's for Harry Kane three goals for England this season 18 goals for buying Munich. So that's 21 And where is he in comparison to Erling Harland now who's whose exploits? I'm sure have not been missed by the England captain Harland also 21 goals For club and country so far this season and and Portugal are now two one up on Hungary As we've mentioned Portugal it is possible for them and it's Ronaldo who scored again in that match It is possible for Portugal to clinch their place at the World Cup as well tonight in Italy winning 1-0 against Israel I see as well, but there we are that's it half time here in Riga Latvia nil England 3 Kelly John Murray Ian Dennis and Matthew Upson in Riga. Thank you very much We will be back with them for the second half of that game, but England very much in control England fans really enjoying themselves. You may have started to hear that coming through on the radio And Thomas Tuchel has been complaining that Wembley was a bit quiet the other day So the England fans have been singing are we loud enough for you amongst other things in Riga this evening? Conor Cody is with us as well. Conor will will get your thoughts on that penalty decision in a second But overall it's the first half that we thought it would be England absolutely dominant And they could be more than three up to be honest at halftime. They've been great. They've been great They've been professional. They've been everything we expected Kelly haven't either way they've played the way they've moved the ball from side to side It was funny actually because they've had all the ball in the first goal comes from John Stones being clever understanding the game and just flipping it in Beirn Frantony-Golden to running behind and score a fantastic goal But yeah, I think it was everything we expected, but we expected England to put on a bit of a show and have been fantastic So long may continue in the second half. Yeah, then they're showing that they're able to break down Latvia However, that third goal came from I'm gonna say I mean sometimes in in European games You get penalties that wouldn't necessarily be given in the Premier League. I'm not sure where this one is on the scale Yeah Do you know what I've just been saying there about do you know if it was anyone other than a Harry Kane? We'd probably give him a bit of stick won't we all he's died, but we could be love Harry Kane He's bad. Listen, it wasn't a dive. He's obviously He's been clever. He's played for it But we would always say that we're Harry Kane one of you if someone else we'd be given them a bit of stick But that's he's played for it. He's a clever clever footballer and there's any practices pens penalties the day before every game And we've seen a little bit of a change in technique a little bit of a stutter Usually he whips it into the corner He did whip it into the corner, but the little stutter before was lovely and you expected nothing else from him Yeah, and this England's second goal Harry Kane's first goal of the game and they said it in commentary It felt like a blueprint of a Harry Harry Kane goal It did it did and it was a brilliant bit of playing the one play you wanted to fall to and unless you you'd say that about a Lot of England players, but just his record he's been on 76 goals now in 110 caps is is remarkable The the numbers he's put it up a fantastic this season both for club and country And you want it to fall to one man right or left foot and it falls to Harry Kane and the way you put it in the corner The positions he finds himself into find these goals and find the side net of the goal the detail He puts into his finishing is all down to repetition and like I said to fall to him on the edge of the box For Latvia, you don't want it to fall to him, but for us It's it's never so what's going to end up in the back of the net So a couple of goals for Harry Kane in the first half of that game one for Anthony Gordon as well Connor's gonna be with us throughout the evening And we'll be back in Riga very shortly for the second half commentary first though It's time for the BBC news with Ryan Dobney the voice of the UK This is BBC radio 5 live Israel's military says the says the red cross is on its way to Gaza to pick up the remains of more deceased hostages Hamas says it'll release between four and six more bodies after handing over four yesterday Well speaking at the White House in the past hour President Trump was asked whether Hamas would disarm in line with his peace plan I'm gonna disarm because they said they were gonna disarm and if they don't disarm we will disarm them They know I'm not playing games. We just something monumental. We got the hostages man now They misrepresented because we were told they had 26 24 of dead hostages if we can use those terms It seems as though they don't have that the home secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced that foreign nationals applying to work in the UK will have to learn English to an A level Standard before they can get a visa the James Cums comes into force rather in January Dr. Ben Brindle is a researcher at the migration observatory He told five live drive who it might affect the most In terms of who is likely to be more affected.

They currently are unbeaten. They've played three They've won three if they can win tomorrow's match They've got well more than one foot in the semi-finals You would think Fionn winners alongside me BBC cricket writer They'll be expected to win this game Pakistan the weakest side in the tournament so far Yeah, England will go into this as strong favorites Pakistan haven't won a game yet. They came close against Australia We thought that we might finally see Australia shows some vulnerability But no they weren't from 76 for seven to 221 as they do but is you know, they've got really effective spin as Pakistan and they've played every game here in Colombo So they'll be a little bit more familiar with the conditions than England though, you know under Charlotte Edgerton's leadership I can't see England taking them lightly But yeah, they should be Contenders to go four from four the problem for Pakistan is that the conditions that will suit them will also suit England spinners who bold absolutely Magnificently against the host Sri Lanka here Safi Eccleston picking up four wickets looks absolutely matchless at the moment the world's number one bowler leading Wicked taker in this World Cup And they're starting to find their feet with the bat with their captain coming into form with that hundred hundred and 14 from that silver brunt of the last game So they're starting to put together what looks like a pretty good run of form Absolutely, I think they could do with a few more contributions from other batters particularly in the top order We've seen match winning contributions from Heather Knight and that silver brunt there to Experienced heads and in these conditions which are proving really difficult That's probably what you would expect they've played here before they've played the most for England But it's proving to be a really difficult tournament for openers So there's a little bit of pressure on Tammy Beaumont and Amy Jones to step up Sophia Dunkely's been short of runs MLM Looking to struggle a little bit at number six It's not where she's used to batting But the point is is that somebody is always stepping up and that is the most promising thing for them with you know much greater Challenges to come in India and Australia and then they should make a semi-final And that's when we'll find out where they're at, you know against the top sides and under pressure But all they can do at this point is beat the teams in front of them It's not their fault that the fixtures have been quite kind to them And if they can go into those games against India and Australia which are there next to after Pakistan They can go into those unbeaten then they couldn't have asked for any more than that And to do that they will have to beat the side that sits at the bottom of the table Pakistan tomorrow But the odds are certainly in their favor That was Dan Norcross and Pheon Wynne and TMS will bring you ball-by-ball commentary live from 10 15 tomorrow morning on Sports Extra earlier today Sri Lanka and New Zealand each took a point when their match was abandoned due to rain Stuart Broad says Australia's ashes team is their worst since 2010 He was reacting to David Warner's prediction that England will lose the series 4-0 It's very very difficult to win in Australia as an England side. It's tears or any side Australia have to be massive favorites When the question really was which teams under the most pressure Well, Australia under the most pressure because they're expected to win. They're brilliant at home but they've got question marks over their team and Question marks over the captain the fitness you wouldn't be outlandish and thinking well, it's actually not an opinion It's a fact. It's probably the worst Australian team since 2010 When England last won and it's the best English team since 2010 so those things match up To fact it's going to be a brilliant ashes series You know Australia have been so consistent for a long period of time that you just knew who was going to open the bay And who was going about what bowlers there were and they don't have that and it's very much a similar situation To 2010-11 when England went and won there the fact of the matter is it Australia generally have to be bad to lose in Australia And England have to be very good England have a great chance of being very good in Australia have a decent chance of being bad Fighting talk from Stuart Broad on the latest episode of for the love of cricket You can listen to that in full on BBC sounds Tomorrow on five live sport will bring you full match commentary of Chelsea's first home game in the women's champions league They welcome Paris FC to Stanford Bridge and Vicki Sparks is going to be on commentary duty Vicki Chelsea unbeaten in the league so far But it wasn't entirely comfortable for Sonya Bonpastore and her side in their opener against 20 No, it wasn't they drop points and they needed a late penalty To rescue that point as well and with this new champions league format in the women's game Which is following suits as we've seen in the men's champions league an introduction of a league phase this season in the women's champions league There's 18 teams only the top four go through automatically to the quarter finals the next day Then go into a playoff round to see if they will then make that last stage and you know with sides like Barcelona to come runners up in in the champions league finals at Arsenal last season I say 20 yes the Dutch champions, but not one of the big hitters in Europe in the women's game Absolutely not a game in which Chelsea would have foreseen Dropping points so this is a really big game for them at home to Paris because you know drop points again And then you're looking at that Barcelona game as well Which is going to be a huge test for Chelsea and thinking well Actually, they're giving themselves a real mountain to climb to finish in that top four and go straight through to the quarter finals Vicki how much of an issue have injuries been for Chelsea or clearly not in in the WSL But are we seeing it it kind of affect them in the champions league? Yeah, they do have some big players out steal the likes of Cadice B canon Naomi German Lauren James Of course who's also not been included in the latest England squad because of injury and my river mirrors They've just got Lucy bronze and a knee chance back from injury But I think the bigger problem Kelly and it's something that Sonya bomb pastore is clearly Infuriated by their manager because she keeps mentioning it It's not for want of trying Chelsea in terms of chances both against FSA 20 and I was there sir Kings medal on Sunday for five live and they beat Tottenham by a goal to nil Chelsea had 27 shots in that game But only four of them were on target and it was just the one goal by which they won And I think that is the key at the moment They're getting into really good positions But it's the final cross the final shot the final ball that's letting them down at the moment and as bomb pastore said look that They had so many chances in that opener against FSA 20, but they couldn't find the breakthrough 20 scored a super goal to put them ahead and and they end up not Killing the opposition's hope was the way she put it and and I think that's the bigger problem for them at the moment Vicki good to talk to you. Thank you so much I know there's going to be lots more build up tomorrow night Vicki's going to be joined by Rachel Corsi live from Stanford Bridge For commentary of Chelsea against Paris FC. That's live from seven o'clock ahead of an eight o'clock kickoff In Riga for us this evening with England leading Latvia by three goals to nil Matthew Upson John Murray and first of all Ian Dennis Lady Kelly your timing is perfection as we are back underway here in the pouring rain in Riga and Latvia have made a change as well that Tony serves has come on for the Koskis That's a halftime change being made by Paolo Nicolao They're Italian coach who's going to come under a little bit of pressure I can tell you because the locals haven't been happy with him so far just three wins in his previous 17 games in charge Since he took over in February 2024 used to be looking after the Italian youth teams all the way up to the under 21s from 2016 to 2023 but well Latvia have been Second best throughout tonight England have dominated from the very first whistle. They are leading by three goals to nil England Haven't made any alterations so they have pick fitting goal Spence cons the stones in Lewis Skelly Anderson Sacker rice Rogers and Gordon and Harry Kane with the two goals one of them a penalty in that first half So three nil and more than on their way to the Americas for World Cup qualification next summer However, Thomas Tuchel, I'm sure would have said to his players. Listen. You're in this position against Wales on Thursday You didn't build on that I don't want any let up as Gordon sends over across and Spence keeps it alive inside the penalty area Rogers is there and then it was able to get the ball away from Zelentkovs in the midfield Latvia then with speed dressing goal It's going to be bikes to the more dis below this is the back three Tony says fast lands that they Zelentkovs Siganics and then good coughs kiss and it can't use as the the two up front in the The all Carmine red that little flash of orange down the side of the shirt a little bit of white in there as well What's the Carmine? I went I went to see whether it was sort of like a maroon or a burgundy But the official colour for Latvia is Carmine red is it? Yeah The red symbolizes courage and struggle the white on their flag nobility and openness Lovely well, they've certainly struggled in this game so far I can tell you two and a half minutes in it's it's the reaction After I think it was the second goal went in if there was a shift in the body language of Latvia I think that you know before that They're at home. They're playing England. They're trying to showcase themselves and do the best they can but it's just kind of dropped off and we'll see start this second half now if they've Got a little bit more bounce in their step, but it is difficult It's demoralizing when you've just not got the ball and you defend it all the time And Anderson again wins the ball he tracked over to this near side got his foot into the challenge got the ball towards Saka He just does it so effectively Does sir? Elliot Anderson who really has it's been seamless the way that he's just slotted into international football It makes it harder like the Bellingham situation that adds another dimension to it as well because it's not even you could then play Deeper with rice with how well Anderson is doing you know what I mean? It takes that off the table as well for for Thomas Tuchel almost It is a bleep night in the Baltics The rain pouring down. It's cold And the England supporters I mean, I don't think Thomas Tuchel criticized the The crowd at Wembley last Thursday saying they were too silent I don't think anybody could ever criticize the England away support. They're extremely loyal Yeah, they're extremely vocal wherever England will travel but throughout that first half they were going through the full repertoire some that I'm unable to repeat but to cool Tuchel give us a song To nil to the library was one at one stage I think are we loud enough for you? I think he got the feeling in that home game because it was a low you mentioned that the Derby game didn't and I know whether expecting that and Obviously the voice that the Welsh fans always carry with them is pretty spectacular isn't it with their supporters? I think that that's probably made it feel the way it did for him But I think it's better point out that in the pouring rain and the cold I'm not fair play to them. No fair. They're are a number in fact. Tell me where they've gone In fact, they you can't beat football fans for improvising and adapting to a situation I was thinking they might have disappeared, but they haven't they've actually gone underneath the stadium Oh, yeah, so now it's elevated on like concrete platforms that end away towards our right They're watching behind the metal gates now on that right-hand side the England supporters And I don't blame them as they shelter from the pouring rain as England playing from left to right all in white leading by three goals to nil I've got a free kick which is Level with almost level with the at the Latvian penalty area and this one is curled. It's fired in It's got a touch of a Latvian head in a very crowded penalty area and Harry Kane was desperate to get on the end of that. What is that now? 76 goals in his 110th game, right? Really amazing numbers, but that delivery from Declan Rice with his right foot I mean he's set piece delivery now is so good corner taken quickly the goalkeepers Palms the ball away only as far as Gordon controls it plays it towards Harry Kane back heals the ball towards Gordon And then it's broken up over on that far side by Robert's Vapes and they try and run it away on that far side It's looking at Harry Kane as well who's scored the most competitive goals for England that is 68 competitive goals in 92 competitive games And Finishing like that left footed goal, you can see why can't you? This is top of the game stuff that with the one he missed in the first half He easily could have had a hat trick yet a goal disallowed inside the opening 60 seconds to remember they lead 3 nil They're England on this this near side the Blond-haired figure of Tony says the substitute England are quick to try and hunt impacts again and close down Latvia That's what Thomas Tuchel want them to maintain that intensity and then you'll have that raft of substitutions that we had on Thursday You know for players to come off the bench and also to try and make their impression I think a big part of this now that he'll want to see who want to see the team be ruthless or want to see You know no ease up whatsoever on that reaction to win the ball back the work great You want to if anything see it get you even better Spence his header in field tied it up by stones all the way to to Jordan Pickford who will be Looking to extend his own record now. He's beat that one that he shared with that with Gordon Banks previously Your ninth consecutive clean sheet for Jordan Pickford and he's 42nd in total And what is his 80th appearance? Some achievement to go through a qualification group without conceiving the gold then I wouldn't it yeah Well, I don't know how many times that's happened, but I can't think very many I Was looking at halftime the last time it happened was for Italian 90 was it but they only played eight games And I think it also happened in 86 as well in England qualified for Mexico 86 England though now have scored in each of their last 18 games the last time it was 18 was back in 1950 to 1955 Although they're still somewhere short of the record of 52 Which was 1884 to 1902 so that will that will take you well beyond Thomas Tuchel's reign as an England manager As here is that Spence The rain continuing to team down Rogers back towards Anderson once again As he plays the ball hard to the feet of Saka from Anderson and Saka now has spent just behind him Rogers inside the penalty area and this in is available gets it out turns on the inside passes the ball now towards Lewis Skelly Lewis Skelly passes the ball back and John Stones Passes the ball out to the left where Declan Rice is the one who provides the whip Gordon's on the inside England still passing it around sharply and swiftly See when that ball got set back to Anderson there I felt he probably should have crossed it first time with his right foot, but we have three players from midfield. I think it was Rogers Rice Kaine and Gordon was tucking in all arriving in the box for that cross Here is the Saka level of the penalty area rolls it gently back towards Anderson Judging by the hand actions of that hopes and he was expecting Anderson again to whip that ball in early But he didn't they patient they go back stones then out towards rice Gordon then makes that run from into out on that left-hand side But rice now runs in field 35 yards out from goal Rogers to Saka on the stretch edge of the area move breaks down But again soon as they lose the ball yeah England then a quick to win it back Although the turn away there by the And he's got the Koskis away here into the penalty area and Conspiracy made a terrific challenge To get back to the Latvian striker and it had to be a well-timed challenge Otherwise he really runs the risk of giving away a penalty and it was exactly that I got it absolutely spot on Brilliant tackle from Condor and he has to come a kind of wraps himself around The player as well to win the ball because if he goes straight for the ball it ended up going through the player first So he has to kind of run at a good yard or so a little bit wider and past him in order to make that tackle Just nearly got caught out there a little bit I think he expected Anderson to keep hold of the ball in midfield it got taken and then we were a little bit exposed Well here he is now again Ladislav Skokoskis on the right-hand side Riggles away from one challenge and then he shoots left-footed and that had the Latvian supporters Giving a little bit of an ooh and an ah because they haven't had much to it get excited about tonight He scored his first international goal in three years in that 2-2 draw against that Andorra He only had one thing on his mind there But it flashed away off his left boot and it's gone out for a goal kick that would have been a spectacular goal It would I mean it was a fair way wide. I'm just looking at the replay the concert tackles a brilliant tackle It really is he gets around the player Really good technical tackle goes to ground but very measured from concert really good recovery This is England's first visit to Terega they met had met for the first time back in March where England went by three goals to know that Wembley but in fact None of the the Baltic nations have actually scored a goal against England Estonia played for loss for Lithuania likewise they've conceded nine and ten goals respectively So not only could Kukovsky's there had had his become the first Latvian goalscorer for the Baltic nations he might have created his own little bit of History here 11 minutes into the second half in these wet conditions There's England with that with concert trotting his way in towards the to the center circle And then passes the ball out towards Rice Anderson lifts the ball over the top looking for Gordon Gordon will get there it was unable to be Kept out there by Tony sets ball into the air Rice brings it down effortlessly controls it Anderson spent Quick passes it out towards Sacher on this near side Ganiak's snapping away at his heels, but Sacher towards Spence Forward ball Rogers Rice wants it Rice gets it receives it now from Rogers Looking then for Lewis Skelly on the the overlap for Spain And now leading Bulgaria 2-0 Arsenault's Mikhail Marino has got that one and Serbia have come from behind and Dora one Serbia 2 is the latest score in England's group group K England Still yet to concede incidentally Looking for the sixth straight winning group K There from Jed spent with a cross from the right hand side And it's any the England fans that end of the ground just goes to show the the confidence of the young man And what is only his third appearance? Rogers had made a good run off the ball there and Anderson couldn't find him as he ran into the inside right channel instead They go out towards Gordon Gordon Spence wants it and also have the option of concert Committing white shirts forward now out towards Sacher Sacher has Saganics in front of him rolls it back Spence first cross with pace and the goalkeeper struggling there And I think he's gonna go down as an own goal England get their fourth goal and a more than well on their way now to the World Cup next summer For me that was all about the pace of the ball Spence the delivery Saganics, I think might have been the unfortunate player Yeah, I think the goalkeeper doesn't cover himself in glory because if you're gonna come for that ball You've got to get more of a touch on it than he does. I mean the delivery super Saka sets it back. It's whipped first time from Spence. It's a nice height But the goalkeeper comes to deal with it and he just flaps it It really doesn't get any kind of contact and then he just puts his defender right in trouble because it ends up Just coming off the boot I mean how that squeaks into the back post because he's a good two or three yards Further back outside of the back post But it just hits him in the shins spins up in the air Agonizingly and just creeps inside that back post this it's a poor piece of goalkeeping that and now here all of a sudden Without fourth goal Thomas Tugel without any hesitation is gonna make a raft of changes We're gonna see Jordan Henderson Jared Bowen and ever reach it as a coming on Declan Rice is Is coming off as well So Henderson comes on for Declan Rice Gets a pat on the back and a hearty slap as well It was from Thomas Tugel. Rogers is coming off for Jared Bowen And there's almost the high fives there for Thomas Tugel to greet the PFA young player of the year And then Saka is also coming off as well. So they're the changes that England have made Matt Yeah, it makes total sense doesn't it? I mean if I'm honest that you could have subbed them, you know And anytime even at halftime because the game's wrapped up at halftime for sure But I think the plan is for To do it on an hour So you stick to the plan because the plan's working well And it makes sense to give these players an opportunity to get on the pitch and get to the rhythm and play in the team And also to rest those players that have been playing a lot of minutes Turkey for Georgian Nill is a latest scoring group E So England and Portugal are going to be the latest teams to qualify for the World Cup as it currently stands There's Gordon keeps the ball in play on that left hand side darts down the byline That's the ball back to Lewis Skelly And then Henderson will get a touch as well Jordan Henderson who's making his 87th appearance for England tonight and then Gordon Rattles the board hard off the shins of us lavender and behind it will go for a corner kick England 4-0 up 61 minutes play. Yes, nice opportunity to work on these set plays as well So said beforehand is hugely important leading into a major tournament getting organized being a threat. I think we have been in This game certainly with the delivery from Declan Rice is is generally spot on is really inviting balls But this one's a little bit different all the players I've literally just crowded the goal line in and around the goalkeeper and it's an In swinging right footed corner as a clips it across and it's caused confusion in the Latvian defense and they quickly turn the ball behind Ever each year Ezzer once again wanders across in front of those Trees that line that far side there must be what 20 of them till you till your trees large-leaved line nice in that they are Yeah there's As a weights once again with another corner kick what an extremely congested six yard area This is stones rises in the air But if a scramble Gordon with a turn and shot blocked and the ball is cleared away by Sagan Yix I think actually the the own goal came off the rather unfortunate substitute Tony sets Rather than Sagan Yix for that that fourth goal from the Spence Cross as England qualifying in some style with two games to spare When I said by the way about this stadium on social media I said one last night I came out just before Jordan Pickford and I took a little Panoramic view of the entire stadium and I said something along the lines of one of the more unusual international venues Don't think has been well received by a few in in Riga One content creator is that what they call them these days? Okay? She said this is hardly a compliment She actually said it in Latvian right so I responded saying it wasn't meant to be criticism either no I responded in Latvia to that did you I did I Didn't know you could what might you always do tend to try and get a bit of the native? Well, I needed that I needed Google translate I'm just impressed that you knew what trees they work to go. I didn't know you were That green finger dinner well I'm slightly better being green figure than I'm with a medical being an expert when I said to Danny Ward last week about That was the shoulder. It was his elbow But here is a as a crossing the ball back Now Anderson well, I've got to confess I did I did need it I've got an app that I use in my garden and I used it to identify which trees they were to did you I did yeah I'm getting down with the technology 63 minutes played the answer to that is no Now it's in his winners Connor Cody back in the studio on air until 10 30 then Tony Livesey takes through We'll have more football for you tomorrow night the Champions League game between Chelsea and Paris and of course the Premier League is back at the weekend Manchester City Everton at 3 full of Arsenal at 5 30 and Then on Sunday Tottenham Aston Villa as Ezra shoots first time could say by the goal key. He's Idris was down low Had to react very very quickly away to his right to keep out as his first time left But it's shot England almost close to a fifth goal Liverpool Manchester United just to finish off that Vocal trail for a weekend offering Matt. Yeah, really good from England again. It's just picking Latvia off at will The game's dead and buried in terms of the outcome England have sealed this match comfortably, but it's about how they conduct themselves now all the way through and Thomas Tuka will keep an eye on everyone. Nobody's slacking off. Nobody taking it easy Maintaining the standards and they're doing that really well. You just feel there's gonna be probably more goals to come in this game There's still a fair old way to go There is we're not even midway through the second half yet But England already leading by four goals to nil was hardy souls getting absolutely soaked Round two and a half thousand high up away towards our right-hand side as Gordon on the left Daskevic waits to come on Edwards Daskevic He moved to outer a Latvian club in the in the summer It'll be his 22nd Latvian appearance out of the last 25 internationals. This here is Ezra Latvia though still defending in numbers as a forward towards spent spent for the low ball in the goalkeeper Gathers it in safely as he falls to the ground inside his six yard area Spencer's been good at that tonight. Yeah, how old is he time that then at the time of the run was perfect He saw the situation read it and he went really early Was fan with the past puts the ball in the right channel just didn't have anyone running across the face of the defender Anderson picks up the ball drives forward Head to the area looks for Jared Bowen and then it required the intervention from Sagan Yix just to get there and actually avoid the leaping goalkeeper who was diving in his own feet of his own player to clear the ball away as the rain drives down with even more Intensity now and in fact the change is going to be Varslavans coming off and Daskevic She's going to be coming on that is like for like just a fresh pair of legs in the midfield for some tired Bodies for this Latvian side that are looking rather be draggled in the rain. Yeah, I mean they have done for quite some time They've really been struggling physically to get to grips with this England team who look Exact opposite. I must say they look bright. We look sharp Plenty of energy in the team. I think physically the squad in as a whole is in a very good place at the moment You can see puddles starting to form on the athletics track in in front of us Incidentally a Guinness World Record was set here in 2008 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the independence of Latvia is bowing on this right-hand side Just to cut inside off his left foot well well wide a goal kick going then it was the most recorded 3800 and seven people the most recorded ran out in a 100 meter in a 24-hour relay Why they didn't wait until 2018 to mark the 100th anniversary for the 100 meters now I've had a bit of symmetry about it. Would it not it would have made much more sense But what's the that they just ran it consecutive? Yeah 20 for 24 hours 3800 and seven But that was some time ago I feel as if they've done a lot of running tonight Seganics is on herring after this ball and he continues to pursue it Jordan Pickford comes out of his penalty area Plays the ball out of play quickly back in position as Latvia take the throw quickly on the left-hand side People just delighted to be involved in the game. Yeah, a rare touch and comes across Like for here for the substitute Why from Tony Sam's right foot it took any flex on its way through and that will go out of play for a corner kick They haven't had a couple of moments in this second half. Yes. Yeah good effort Really nice effort with the right foot It comes all the way across to the right-hand side Clicked out to the edge of the box and it's a first-time effort strikes it really cleanly actually zips off the turf and just wide Defection on the way through played the corner short Pickford makes the save and then the acrobatic effort is well off target But Dashek which certainly caught hold of that left foot in and Jordan Pickford then was called into action for his first save And he earned his money as well in would lead by four goals to nil They're on their way to qualify for the World Cup and he and out to take you through as small Substitutions are in the offing is a substitution of our own John Murray. Yes, it's going to be Dan Bern Who's going to come on next for England just wandering up to the side of the pitch across the the damp Running track, but Jordan Pickford will feel that he's contributed after that Sharp save wasn't it? It was a well struck shot by Dashek of it and he parried it away A little bit like the Wales game the other night when he had to make a couple of saves in the second half and And did so well England at the other end now with a chance which Anderson shoots that's blocked across the penalty area. Born can't get there and it bounces down for Latvia and cleared up Jordan Henderson stretching just got his head to it and was able to with that glance take it back to John Stones. Yes, Jordan Henderson's 87th cap tonight John Stones 85th now here is Jed Spence on the right-hand side As Elliot Anderson was was quite heavily challenged from behind By Dashek of it, but England still with it as they play from left to right the home supporters as you can hear despite the 4-0 scoreline Have turned up the volume and still lots of empty seats in the England section as Ian was describing Many of the England fans have come down and are watching from ground level From underneath the stand peering through through the metal fences I'm sure there'll be pictures of that because the All the photographers are at this end of the ground. They won't have missed that opportunity here Spence does well beats his man then comes back onto his right foot and And now with the bull stationary on the ground Spence a little swivel of the hips Jordan Henderson wins the throw into the deflection level with the edge of the Latvia penalty area We're going to see Marcus Rashford as well So burn and Rashford are going to come on and that is it Anthony Gordon on the night that he scored his second goal for England He opened the scoring for England this evening and Marcus Rashford on loan with Barcelona But judging by what Thomas Tuchel was saying the other evening You know he's got work to do To make sure of his place in the England squad and Gordon comes often well again Matt. Yeah Really really pleased with Anthony Gordon. I thought he had an excellent game worked hard Looked like he was going to create good balls in the box got his goal And I think just up in those numbers just getting that goal and assist have been more Reward for the work that he does is going to take him to the next level And John Stones evening is all about as well and Dan Berners come on to replace him the new Castleman winning his fourth cap for England after making his debut being the surprise selection in Thomas Tuchel's first squad He's been a part of the whole thing throughout the now eight matches And as I say winning his fourth cap tonight Here is Rashford into the action for the first time black gloves on then plays it back Henderson works it to the left-hand side in comes the cross from Lewis Skelly Which is deflected behind for another England corner. I must say when Marcus Rashford is able to shift that ball inside onto his right foot When he hits that ball John, it's like an absolute rocket Isn't it has horrible movement on it for the goalkeeper if he can manufacture that half a yard Is one of the best in the business at hitting that right foot shot coming inside the pitch and he looks for it every time So that's five substitutions, isn't it for England now? Yep, and as that will take this corner From over there on the far side almost in the shadow of those trees Flag post behind him the flags hanging limply and one of those massive Gray floodlight pilots towering all for him there and the lamps on it. There must be 25 lamps on that It's not more of the world. It is it is. It's exactly what it's like So a bit of HG Wells in Riga and a packed penalty area again They are crowding the goalkeeper as a is just going to drop this in which he does now to the near post and it's headed away for Latvia For nail England lead and on their way to confirming that place at the World Cup next summer and We are going to see changes two more for Latvia Turkey now winning for one against Georgia and good good Koskis the number nine is Is going to be replaced by the number 20 Marco Rigsha Who's winning his will winners 14th cap up front and Also leaving the field Lucas Vapna in the midfield with Coming on in the field Savalyevs into the midfield Alexi Savalyevs who started against Andorra here at the weekend and is now pitch the number 22 Savalyevs So if you just switched onto us on five live England on the way to confirming qualification with two matches to spare Anthony Gordon Scoring the first goal in the first half two goals from Harry Kane the second of a penalty just before the break and then the Tony says own goal In the second half and England have not let up Which you wouldn't expect them to do It's easily done though, John, isn't it? I know we're not expecting it because of the mindset they're at but it's very easy to take your foot off the gas in these kind of Situations and you're right that they really haven't done England that played with the same purpose and same quality And consa works it to the right-hand side Jed spends starting as the right back with Lewis Skelly at left back So the the full backs who did so well in Serbia Lefremento and Rhys James ruled out of this but Spence and Lewis Skelly have not done themselves any harm and Spence now to Born, Born pulls it back but the captain Shenemore East was there to steer it behind for another corner for England this time from the right-hand side Got that really good energy now in wide air is bowing on this near side on the right Looking to make an impression drive at the defenders who are looking a little bit tired and not really You know in in that physical Sharpness that he's in having just come off on the bench. I mean he could really exploit that situation Baricet as they mix his way to this side and raises a left arm as that takes the corner Which is a low one and it is struck low by Harry Kane And that's a that's a decent stop actually through a crowd of players kept out then it's in from born That's hooked away on the edge of the six-yard box by Tony chefs comes back to England again as a Drifting infield and then clipping it with his left in step to Elliot Anderson now He has Rashford Rashford's ball into the box bounces down and Stretching for it in there Dan Byrne Just slightly behind him up for the set piece And it is cleared away to the halfway line and Republic of Ireland have taken the lead against Armenia Evan Ferguson with the the golds been a wretched campaign for the Irish But winning 1l against Armenia Portugal still 2-1 up on Hungary last we heard Portugal have the chance tonight like England to clinch their place at the at the World Cup England continuing to press forward With Jordan Henderson receiving it back and actually going all the way back towards the halfway line So they're gonna do it tonight Matt with two matches to play Thomas took a like liking what he's saying He's just raising a clenched fist there He's got a blue book baseball cap and a padded jacket on will hear from him I would think on five lives before 10 30 this evening will have the live interviews from the tunnel You'll hear them all on the football daily podcast on the BBC sounds out Rashford does well beats his man left for it cross comes off a lap in head as I hit the shot that was that was Miss hit actually and easily cleared away, but England take up possession again near the halfway line Somebody puts up a red umbrella just down in front of us even though the rain has eased it was torrential at one point and It's not the coldest night it has to be said even though we're so close to the Baltic sea It's it's not windy tonight and the wind that sweeps in off the Baltic sea has got a real edge to it As we discovered over the course of the last couple of days Boen and then Spence is dispossessed and Latvia breaking away down the left-hand side with Balodis the left-sided central defender but Spence is able to tackle back and it's out of play for a throw into England on the halfway line So Latvia nil England for under gareth southgate Matt The last qualification for euro 2024 gareth southgate side did it with two matches to spare For world cup 2022 it was done on the final night of group matches when they won 10 nil in San Marino I remember that well that was a dank night as well Euro 2020 it was done with one match to spare when they beat Montenegro in the 1000th match this concept plays it forward towards Ezra but So it's a free kick near the right corner of the box Yeah, I think it was just a little bit late called as a as he told the ball away the tackle came in I think his foot went right on top of the Z's Didn't get any of the ball the referee just brought it back Real films the balmy is This is an X month about We need we need him with his knowledge of Latvia Get that those lights the attendance Spectators, thank you very much. So capacity for the Dalgava Stadium born with the free kick in Right across the face of goal beyond everyone and it's bouncing away the balls running away and it might hit one of those trees It's just rolled past the trunk of the one that's furthest right and out of sight That's a long way way as well There's a car park just behind us Spain 3 Bulgarian nil is the latest score there and And just to finish that off as Latvia break forward He has a ball through the middle for dash Kovic who's already had a chance now to the right-hand side and Latvia pouring bodies forward. I think four nil down I think it would be seen as a As a little success if they were able to register their first goal against England just the second meeting Between England and Latvia's men's senior teams remembering March England once 3 nil How he came scored in that one as well as those Reese James free kick remember that to open the scoring and Abirate as I scored his first goal for England in that match Latvia still with the ball inside the end half and then going back towards the the halfway line But the pass forward from Tony chefs will bounce all the way to Jordan Pickford who takes that easily Italy now 2 nil up on Israel trying to catch Norway Retevi has scored that one and Dora one Serbia 3 Mitrovic Scoring that goal after and Dora took an early lead. That's the other match in this group England next month With this scoreline will have matches against Serbia at Wembley and Albania in Tehran I had the final two qualifiers that will will really take on for England the the role of Tuning England up for the finals. Yes They're good games to have aren't they in terms of that, you know the pressure is off for qualification so you can really Start to use them as matches to hammer your messages home get the team set up keep You know picking whatever that team is that you want to play Which for me Again after this performance John, I shouldn't imagine he would make too many changes Thomas to you wouldn't have expected No It countings now the ball towards the edge of the penalty area But Berns able to step in and then he's challenged and he's felled and it's a free kick to England so Latvia nil England for and Just to go back to that Gerrard Southgate's first tournament for Wilk up 18 England qualified with one match to spare so The last time they qualified with three matches to spare was Roy Hodgeson's ill-fated final tournament at Euro 2016 so As ever it's not how you qualify. It's what you're doing the finals. Absolutely. However the Getting the job done I think is so important because England Thomas Tuchel the FA can then begin to really put their plans in place and Firm things up and also steal a march on on everyone else potentially. Yeah, I completely agree and and it will be using those games to really Get the team in that position where he wants them one now chasing after this ball that West Ham captain trying to hook it back It actually hits chair. No more days and bounces down for goalkeeper. Zvi Edris We'll have more England commentary for you tomorrow Incidentally At the women's cricket World Cup 10 15 in the morning England Pakistan live from our team in Colombo That will be on sports extra on your BBC sounds app and tomorrow night Chelsea against Paris FC We heard from Vicki at halftime Vicki sparks. That'll be on five live sports tomorrow evening, but England winning handsomely here in the in the Riga rain and Rashford speeds away down the left-hand side takes it on towards the dead ball line pulls it across Low got that just as it reached the white line was able to pull it back that the falling chair and Mordy Put it behind for another England corner. I mean physically We've just been a couple of levels above this Latvia team this evening It stood out like a sore thumb the strength and the power and the pace of this England team is Is miles ahead of where that mirror and it just gets highlights certainly in those wide areas and Marcus Rashford really exploiting it there They're asking the England fans to remain seated for 25 minutes after the match corner has taken short Anderson drives it in but that's blocked inside the penalty area Anderson wins it back again and then a little ball to the edge of the box for conza back to Henderson His ball right across the penalty area that's worked across but it is cut out intercepted by pipes and Latvia are able to get it away 25 minutes sitting in the pouring Latvian ring Doesn't particularly Appeal there's quite a lot of people making a move down to underneath the stand right now I should imagine everyone will be underneath here as opposed to yeah in the stand Yes, the big concrete stands at either end of the ground with Rashford turning now As a rather turning now over on the far side the rain now coming down harder than ever six minutes to play and England cruising it now Henderson to Anderson And then back to Henderson Jed Spence All the way back towards the the halfway line Jed Spence has emerged as quite the took all choice hasn't he yeah He's done well Don't see anything with him in an English show that makes me feel he shouldn't be in and around this situation Jordan Henderson lifting one over the top looking for the the run of Spence into the penalty area half cleared away Anderson and then Jordan Henderson looks one way passes it the other Henderson back towards the the center circle That rain is coming straight down now You can probably hear it drumming on the on the corrugated iron roof above our heads people three rows in front of us are getting soaked Here's Henderson again up to the right-hand side to Spence and then back towards the the halfway line It has been very Autumnal Regal let me tell you the weather changeable But when the sun has shone I mean the autumn colors the cobbled street the domes the spires The the blue and white trams trundling through the streets It is a very picturesque place to come to and England have enjoyed their visit winning here the most important thing To get the result that they needed and get qualifications sorted out Lapier coming forward. They just want another clean sheet six wins out of six. It'll be no goals conceded England's through the middle again attacking born now to the Left to Esa cuts in field and shoots and scores and it's 5-0 to England and they're doing it on style And as I know points to the heavens with the rain pouring down on him England World Cup bound and winning here in Riga 5-0 against sorry Latvia Well, it's another goal from a really good piece of just defensive play turning the ball over like England have done all evening Really hunted in packs and won the ball back efficiently It's with bow and he's driving forward through the heart of the pitch He sees as a slips him the ball and then he's got quite a bit of work to do has to be said He's got a couple of players that dropped back with him But he's on the left hand side of the box, but he has that little opening to drift inside You can't allow him inside on to his right foot and the moment they do He just slots it into that far post bottom corners It's a good finishing on show tonight from England and as a taking full Opportunity to put that ball in the back there. They're really nice goal Yep second goal for England in his 14th appearance for the new Arsenal man And indeed both goals have been against Latvia at Wembley in March and here in Riga in October so 5-0 it is which I think is the kind of score line that's matched England's performers Yeah, I had a feeling that it could be this type of score line tonight and England certainly haven't disappointed No, they haven't they have found their groove haven't they coming into these autumn qualifiers We were talking you know are they going to be able to find their identity the way that Thomas Tuchel wants them to play well They've done that resoundingly. Yeah, I agree And you want to see that time and time and time again Thomas Tuchel wants to see it in training again as he just claps the away fans there Thomas Tuchel Yeah, if you didn't hear earlier as Ian was saying that The England fans were were having a bit of fun with Thomas Tuchel after what he said About how quiet Wembley was on Thursday night against Wales So they were singing are we loud enough for you was it quite for you John? Well, the thing is with Wembley You know, I think virtually every England manager has complained about the atmosphere at Wembley at one time I know that you know Garry Southgate remember how frustrated he got with the paper planes Accounting is being replaced for the final minutes of the match by Chris Dapps Grabowskis who was winning his first cap Plays his football in Denmark for B93 the 20 year old He's able to to get his first experience of international football here Against Thomas Tuchel's England side Latvia nil England five We will bring you the interviews from life down in the tunnel area here in this compact stadium just over 10,000 people 10,400 and 2,700 England fans many of whom have been watching from underneath the stand to our right in the second half Jared bonus taken a knock Whether he's just taking a kick on the ankle perhaps They look like that and he is he is down on his knees and he's felt that one You know how sore that can be as Latvia Do attack down the left-hand side with Tegan Yix Then the run forward down into the towards the full back position Tegan Yix gets that bad tries to turn Harry Kane puts in the Challenge Harry Kane who's playing the full match incidentally Having scored two goals by a new next packed schedule, but He wants to play doesn't the and Thomas Tuchel wants him to play didn't play against Wales because of the bruised foot Latvia as we move into the Towards the 90th minute of this World Cup qualifier Latvia attacking and the ball deflected goalwards But then cleared away up in the air by Jordan Henderson and then it is cleared further away with Rashford chasing It gets their first nimble footed Marcus Rashford passing it forward to Harry Kane and England now with Kane and Rashford in full-flaw As they're as well Kane continues on looking for the hat trick and in fact he's bundled over And Kane goes sprawling down onto the pitch 23 yards out and it's a free kick. I'm not too sure about that for a foul I think it's a little bit hard Kane does well actually because he looks like he's gonna Unleash the shot Rashford makes a brilliant run real energy that Marcus Rashford brought onto the pitch as a substitute But he just refrains from it puts the brakes on a little bit and there's a small bit of contact But he knows what he's doing Harry Kane and he goes down and wins the foul Two minutes of added time and England with this free kick I think England were a little fortunate Harry Kane to have VAR The warring England a penalty just before halftime that Harry Kane scored that he Is involved in this he's at the heart of this Harry Kane So he's got two goals. He has the chance to score a hat trick and he is one Hat trick away from equaling Jimmy Greaves as record of six hat tricks for the England senior men's team At came it is going to be Harry Kane. I don't think that's any surprise So this will be between 25 and 30 yards out Kane on his right foot the Latvian wall is lined up just outside the box Born to the right of the ball, but surely it's came it is right for it from came But it's over the wall and over the high over the crossbar as well and actually fielded very well by an absolutely soaked ball boy Who caught it on the half body quite cleverly? So into two minutes about a time we'll have more from Conakody as well Who's back in the studio the five-life studio with Kelly in the latter part of? Five-life sport this evening on air till 10 30 will hear from Thomas Tuchel a victorious Thomas Tuchel Leading England to World Cup qualification having won his first six competitive matches Fabio Capello by the way won his first eight competitive matches But to win six out of six and I know people will say well the call it to the opposition It hasn't been the the sternest But to win six out of six and not concede a goal Yeah, you can't get away from that It hasn't been the sternest because it hasn't but you still got to come up with with the goods and England are doing Here they are looking for another one Anderson's ball across goal that's pushed away by the goalkeeper to Find a teammate with that diving clearance and there it is The final whistle goes and with that final whistle We can say that England will be at the World Cup in the Americas in 2026 they've done the job and they've done it in style winning five mil here in the reign of Riga it feels a world away the conditions that we're sitting in here from I don't know Florida next summer Certainly nothing like Kansas will be which is where England may well be based But England have qualified for the World Cup with two matches to spare and Thomas Tuchel has achieved his first goal As the England head coach Yeah, I mean take away the opposition and just focus on England for a moment What we're looking from a group of players and a team that can go on and achieve great things in a World Cup You're seeing really good traits in this team at the moment I think Thomas Tuchel is going to be very happy very positive with his team's attitude application with the whole display They were they were clinical in front of goal had some really good movements in and around off the ball Defensively another clean sheet. It's been a good evening. Yeah, six wins out of six Clean sheets in in all of the matches. We're not seeing wild celebrations marked by by any means from the England players You know, they are they're aware of what they've done and how they've done it and the opponents that they've done it against But they should be proud shouldn't they have their achievement nevertheless? Yeah, I think you know the confidence of this group They felt that this was going to happen anyway, and they were absolutely right and it felt like that right from the first ball was kicked To be honest, I mean England in total control Looked like they had an objective that they were going to have to complete and they did it comfortably and like you say John They just congratulation each it congratulating each other, but it feels like it's totally expected Yeah, Thomas Tuchel I'm just watching him now as the Latvian players have moved away the handshakes have happened And now the England squad are all by themselves in the middle of that half. It's an incongruous sight I must say with the floodlights shining down the rain falling that The backdrop of the trees and the massive scoreboard and away to the right the England fans Those who are still in their seats sulked as well in there are welcoming them Welcoming them all that and they are being led there the England players by the captain by Harry Kane Who is now being followed by the rest of his teammates right off the pitch and towards the advertising hoardings? I think they might be going to yes, he is yeah, Harry Kane is actually What? Stepping over the hoardings and they're going to walk. I mean it must be it must be 40 yards Behind the goal that stand in which the England Supporters are in and they're lifting their flags now the England fans the crosses of St. George and waving them and all of the Photographers gather around and the England players down below applauding up towards the fans Yes, it's a lovely touch and for me It's only right these supporters have traveled a long way in really difficult conditions this evening to come here and support the team And they've done it brilliantly and it's just a nice touch from the group and the manager to go across and show their appreciation Yep, it is mission accomplished in terms of World Cup qualification and the England players standing in a line at that end while the rest of the Stadium is Is emptying I must mention a flag by the way I sought the other end in the in amongst the Latvia fans It was a Latvia flag with Stourbridge Latvia written across the middle on the top BC FC Birmingham City FC one of your old clubs Matt and it had the names of Ann and Tommy on one side and underneath WBA the Hawthorns with Jack and Colin Fascinated to know the story behind that Latvia flag But anyway, the story is all about England tonight and their qualification Having been sealed for the World Cup after goals from Gordon two from came one a penalty 76 now for England for him a Tony said zone goal and then a Berrucha as a Scoring to make it 5-0 Latvia nil England 5 the final score and England are bound for the World Cup John Murray Ian Dennis and Matthew Upson in Riga for us this evening as we've been here in the England players are making their way over To the England fans in that Baltic rain in Riga this evening Conor Cody is also with us Connor We've been saying it was a straightforward win for England But nevertheless an impressive one because they have to go out and they have to do it Straightforward win yet as we expected I think Kelly, but you still got to go and do the business You still got to go and perform you still got to go in score goals You still got to go and do things the right way and I thought England were fantastic What I love most is the reaction when they lost the ball the professionalism to go and win the ball back There was always four or five bodies around the ball to win it back and then start another attack and I love these Substitutions after 4-0 I just thought at 4-0 you keep the same players on the pitch It can just drop a little bit because the game is one all the sudden you bring players on the pitch You want to score can see opportunities to score and we've seen the goals that that were added towards the end of the game So really professional from England I think it's bring a brilliant qualifying campaign and listen It's going to another World Cup and then players will be absolutely over the moon We're gonna be here till 10 30 so we'll have time to go into the into the details of it In terms of going to the World Cup obviously the draw is not going to be made until the beginning of December So we don't know who England's opponents are going to be What we do know though is it's a bigger World Cup and there are going to be this kind of game that England potentially are going to be playing in There's a different style of football sometimes at World Cups to what there is in in the build-up to World Cup So it's important that they're prepared for for every eventuality Of course it is but it's World Cups are always different to anything I was lucky enough to obviously go to Katara and when you get there the most extraordinary amazing Experiences you will ever have in your life as a player So for them players now be excited because there's a lot of them have played at major tournaments before a lot of them are incredible footballers We all know who they are within the squad But a lot of them will be first time going to a World Cup so get excited be excited that it's a bigger tournament Be excited there's a lot of traveling or whatever it's going to bring because they are the best experiences you will ever have So now it's a brilliant brilliant achievement for England something that we expected them to do it was the the minimum that we expected But now they've gone and done it without conceiving a goal Can they go through the whole campaign now and and get it finished off in the right way those England players heading over to the The England fans are absolutely drenched in icy cold rain over in Latvia But I think you were saying that earlier on the England fans have traveled a long way It's only right that the players should go over and show their appreciation but equally those England fans will be delighted with what they've seen There was a lot of talk early on in Thomas Tuchel's time that maybe it wasn't the most exciting that it wasn't the most Front foot at times that there's proof look against we should qualify that by the opposition that they played But they're showing that they can get it done and they can build that that rhythm Yeah, I agree Kelly and I think that you know It's not easy coming into a fresh group of players as a manager having very limited exposure and having to pick the right team So yes, there were some bumps in the road But you feel that he's got a handle on the character of the players and how they react What type of player he wants in the group the balance of the team looks good Anderson again this evening was excellent And like I said to John, you know in the commentary I don't expect massive of changes for the next game I just don't I think but when you're in this moment you're in this rhythm is set his stall out and It's having a positive impact in terms of the performance of the players So I fully expect the team to be very similar, but also as well It was against the lesser opposition if you think back to the start of his reign Albania at home and Latvia at home where they won 2-0 and 3-0 They laboured in Barcelona when they only be Andorra 1-0 in the in the qualifier in June And he was criticized for those performances Thomas Tuchel and quite rightly he was criticized So therefore When you're playing against the opposition and you now putting them to the sword He should be praised because the last three games has seen a marked improvement Deno just before you head off and I know John's gone down to get some interviews and you're going to be going down there very shortly as well But in terms of the substitutions, that's what Connor mentioned the fact that it you know for nail up There was a temptation for England to to maybe relax a little bit into the game But it was Henderson as a bow and came on and he's getting minutes in in these players who could prove crucial when the tournament gets underway Yeah, and he didn't he didn't get that in the second half against Wales So I think that element would have would have pleased Thomas Tuchel tonight because he's you know we talked before ahead of the game about the The hidden messages if you like for Jude Belegum, he's been quite clear regarding Marcus Rashford You know you can only be a great player if you go and achieve great things and he says for Marcus Rashford You know you've got no limits as far as your career is concerned, but you've got to go out and prove it So I think when Marcus Rashford comes on tonight and Anthony Gordon deserved to start and you put it a lively performance and scored a fine goal Marcus Rashford now knows what he's got to do to try and You serp dislodge Anthony Gordon from that position all of a sudden in the various elements of the England setup You can see now where Positions are going to be for players competing against each other and Thomas Tuchel has made a point when it was for the start of these autumn games In September he said right. This is where we ramp up the competition He had a slightly larger squad in June and they went away for some warm training in in Barcelona Obviously got John Stones out there as well He deliberately then reduced the squad size in September and that's the reason why you've got you there's no Foden and Bellingham and Grealish because he wants to ramp up the competition He wants to see that hunger and desire from the players who have privileged to wear the shirt now Because if they don't show that then they won't necessarily keep the shirt But England know of course that they will be heading off to the World Cup next summer Denner you're gonna be going a little less far presently You're gonna head down and get some of those interviews at the end of England's five-nil victory Against Latvia, but just to come back to that point matter about the use of the squad By by Thomas Tuchel in this victory against Latvia the fact that he's got players in there He's given them minutes and not just you know Changing players up with five minutes to go is that half an hour for three of them 20 minutes For a couple of those players in the in the squad just keeping everybody involved as well Yeah, it'll be for keeping people involved. It will be for resting players that have had a lot of minutes Having freshness on the pitch like Connor mentioned when you go that far up It's easy just to go into cruise control you bring on someone like Jordan Henderson Who's not gonna stop talking and driving everything with his voice and getting people around him and and then players coming on Wanting to express express themselves to get themselves into the starting lineup so creating healthy competition In an international setup is not that easy because you're not around the players every day You haven't got that ability to to build that so he's actually done that quite quickly Thomas Tuchel and it might need to be a bit ruthless at times and make you know cut off and tough tough decisions But he's shown that he's more than capable of doing that and he does it in a way that is kind of Palatable it's not it's not too brutal even though the decisions are the decisions You know that's that's top-level football that's top-level competition in anything So I feel the squad has that and it can only be a healthy thing for the group And I think we've got the two perfect guests here to reflect on the fact that England have got through their qualifying group without even conceding a goal Connor Yeah, it's always nice. It's always nice and we listened to Jordan Pickford's interview before before the game didn't we Talking about was a team listening. He will love keeping clean sheets whether he touches the ball once or a hundred times He will love keeping clean sheets and it's always the backdrop, isn't it? And there's some big muscle to the same thing as well as defenders as goalkeepers as a team You like keeping clean sheets it keeps you in a game and listen tonight wasn't about staying the game tonight It's about going win the game and scoring four or five goals and doing what England have done But it's always nice and that just keeps on there adding to Jordan Pickford's record doesn't it in terms of nine now So let's keep it going for him. Hey, yeah He's on an incredible run of form in that England goal But the defense starting to really click depending on you know or rather regardless of whose Thomas Tuchel is picking in those positions Maybe the full backs are ones that we can look at between now and 10 30 But that record the England are on you know as dinner was we're saying England have now scored Matt in each of their past 18 matches that's the first time they've done that since between 1950 and 1953 and it's been a long long run in which they've been incredibly successful at both end of the pitch Yeah, no, I agree. There's lots of good things to come out of it I mean the one thing and I think this might refer back to the the Wembley feel in terms of atmosphere as well There's been a lot of games in the last couple of years that have been a bit Kind of flat in terms of teams coming and being very defensive And I think those games can lead to being not the most entertaining they can sometimes draw out Drab kind of displays even though wing England do win the game and we do keep a clean sheet So so it can be a little bit bit misleading to get too excited about those kind of stats They are really you know, they're really impressive but it's about the performances and the and the style of play and What teams you're playing and the jeopardy in the game that really drives the excitement and puts the players to the test And while you have to be professional in these fixtures if you're organised and you're well-drilled and you've got a good group together This England team's got the talent to cruise through these kind of games It really hasn't it shown it in the last three or four matches But when it gets put to the test of those real jeopardy games against top nations That's when you really see what it's all about and maybe maybe this team doesn't get tested enough like that Yeah, there's been an incredible run for for England and as Matt was saying you don't want to read too much into it Conor The danger is that there's always expectation on England anyway And now they're going to be heading into the World Cup with this great record It's 240 days before the World Cup even gets underway in America and suddenly Expectations are just just going to start creeping up a little bit more. Yeah, and that's what we do as English people Isn't it and you wouldn't have it any other way? I think it's it's going to creep up as well because the manager we've got we all understand what the manager's coming for the manager's Remit is to win the World Cup. I think we all expect that we all know what is remit is and listen This country comes with expectation when you pull on the England shape I'll tell you the same thing it comes it weighs heavy because there's an expectation about playing for England You have to win and sometimes I think that comes you mentioned before Kelly about the atmosphere at Wembley and things like that I think it comes because you're expected to win games at that stadium. It's expected to happen English people Expect their team their country to go and win games at stadium. So 100% will be an expectation Let's embrace the expectation. I think we've got a group of players who can embrace that I think we've got strong players who the shit weighs heavy, but they like that They'll take that on board and they'll take it into the world, but I can't wait for it I'm so excited. It's there's nothing compared to a World Cup or a major tournament. So to see England are finally there It really excites me. It's something I can't wait for. Yeah 240 days to wait though. Yeah, don't get too carried away too early on We've got 240 days of build up to that one before it before it actually gets underway but just to pick up on that point that Connor made about the the England fans map because People will have heard Thomas Tuchel's comments about them being quite quiet at Wembley and it is it's a different crowd at Wembley And often you've got a lot of families a lot of people who are there It may be there their first or one of the few England games that they they go to is it's a very different crowd the England Traveling fans are very different and they were on very good form for this game in Latvia And we're sort of having a bit of fun with Thomas Tuchel as well Yeah, they were all game actually and he responded really well and I think you know It's probably easier for him to make those comments There may be what it was for someone like Gareth Southgate, you know But he's not English to begin with and he's fresher into the job and he's kind of Has the ability to make those comments, but it's kind of can be harsh, but it's not too cutting You know what I mean? I think he's always open to a viewpoint or a response back as well and I think he felt it as a local derby certainly the Welsh game and Didn't get the response that he wanted out of the home fans and those points you mentioned as well Can in terms of who's going to the game is it families is it so so it is a different mix But but the away fans here this evening. I mean that they were just in full swing turned out in full force I mean, there's a few staying in our hotel. You walk around Riga You'll see England fans dotted about and they've come and really supported the team And you know that a good rapport with Thomas Tuchel this evening and and don't know chatting to them in Latvia and as well Well Yeah, what is it's one of the two things that he's getting up to that's true That's true and in terms of the job that Thomas Tuchel's done Connor What what are your thoughts on how much credit he has to take for for this campaign even I know we I'm gonna stop doing this I feel I've made the point now even in terms of you know the level of the of the group because we've seen lackluster qualifying campaigns at times against Supposedly beatable opposition, but this is as near to perfect as England could have been so how much credit does Tuchel take a lot of it Most of it all of it. Whatever you want to say. I think he's been brilliant. I love We're England out the minute. I love the feeling around the squad I love the feeling around how ruthless the manager is and he is ruthless and we go back to kind of the little dig He added the supporters, but let's be honest He's ruthless with the players as well Everything he's come out in the week to talk about Marcus Rashford needing to be the best in the world can be the best in the world We've obviously touched on before the game about the players he left out It's not just these being ruthless with one one side of the nation with supporters or just were plays He's ruthless with anyone because he wants the best and he wants the best for his team and we can see that so I think he takes an awful amount of credit And it just makes me laugh whenever we see an English manager and the first thing when he first come in and you expect miracles straight away Don't we so we all give him criticism for the for the winner and door and all this sort of thing But now we're sat there going England in a real good place I love the clip in the first half where the fans were we're giving them a little bit He had a little right smile and put his hand up and I just feel like England in a real good place So good place to move forward a good place to to improve and get better obviously leading into that massive tournament next year Hold that thought because John Murray is talking to Harry Kane Yes Here is the England captain Harry Kane on the night that World Cup qualification has been Assured and delivered and you've led from the front Harry. You did it well, didn't you? Yeah, it was a great game from us I spoke before about you know building momentum and no matter who we play to hold on to that to hold on to winning games To hold on to clean sheets to pressing high scoring goals and then we done all that so Another great camp we can be really proud to qualify with with two games to spare It's never as easy as what it looks, you know a lot of preparation a lot of hard work goes into into what we do and ultimately You know we have to handle that pressure of being the favorites and and we've done that really well so far So another tournament to look forward to is the best thing about this particular window the fact that you have been able to Follow on and pick up from where you left off in Serbia Yeah, 100% and after the Serbia game You know I spoke to the group about that about you know building the momentum that we're we're feeling amongst each other not just on The pitch but also off the pitch and You know these camps come around quick We play so many games at club level before we know it we're back again And it's important to keep that ball rolling and even though we've qualified now Still two big games in the November camp and I think we've only got six games from now until the first World Cup game So every moment counts every training session every day together. It's about building something special and You know we've been doing that especially over the last few camps So hopefully November will be no different and of all the many achievements and things that you've done You know every single tournament will cook European Championship when England have qualified you've been on the score sheet all of them Yeah, that's right on the night. It's been done So yeah for me I always try and celebrate things like it's the first You know I I spoke before about how proud I am to play for England and especially major tournaments and Yeah, whether it's your first or whether it's your fifth sixth They're all special and I think American that's that summer will definitely be be special and will feel that so Never take these moments for granted and like I touched on earlier We spend a lot of time a lot of hard work together to achieve this so we should celebrate tonight and On the plane home and then look forward to getting back to club level and can I just ask as well The the style in which England have played in these recent matches, you know, you found the groove there You played in America at the FIFA Club World Cup with Bayern Munich last summer Is it going to be possible to play this style this high-tempo pressing style in those conditions? I think so I think sometimes You know, it sounds like you're taking a high risk or it sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort But it's sometimes funny if you do it early and do it and win the ball back quickly You're the one who actually has a lot of possession and I think we found that in the summer with with buying You know, we ended up having 60 70% of the ball, which is probably the most important thing when you're planning that he making the other team run So Yeah, and of course sometimes the opposition always gonna break the press and you have to you have to run back But ultimately I think if you get it right you will actually win it back quicker and then you'll keep more possession So that's our aim. We want to be an aggressive team. We've shown that in the last few games, especially And yeah, we're gonna of course come up against tougher tests and better teams So all this is just great practice for when that comes well done tonight and enjoy the moment with the teammates Thank you. Thanks Harry. Harry Kane England captain Thank you very much John Murray John Murray and Ian Dennis in the tunnel and getting interviews from within that England camp and We'll play them to you as and when they come in It really interesting couple of points that he made in in that interview Matt One of them was about building momentum that he said they're feeling on and off the pitch It's not just about the fact this is job done Then they've got the games to come at home to Serbia and then away in Albania in the November International break and then I think it's four games between then and the the start of the World Cup We said this isn't about just filling that time and using this to experiment. This is about building momentum ahead of a tournament Yeah, very much feels like that. It's not about filling the time and discovering and well Should we have a look at this or should we try that out? No, I think it's like this is us This is what we're doing. Let's just get better at that Let's get better at being us and whether it is that press where they win it back I completely agree with his point that he's made to John's question there in the sense that if you can win the ball back quicker It's gonna save you overall in the game More energy and more running if you can win it back quicker because you have the ball again and then you go again So if that is something that England are gonna work at out of possession Which I think is a great thing and a trait of a top team then Brilliant and I think they've showed that again this evening the intensity of getting after the ball when they've lost it I think Jed Spence did really well with that all the players did well with it Anderson reads it so well So yeah, I think just hone in on being the team that they are right now Keep getting better at what they're doing and they're you know, they're gonna go into that tournament in a good place Matt we're gonna bring in Anthony Gordon now with John Murray Yes, what the man who opened the scoring for England tonight Anthony Gordon has just crept up on my blind side Great to be involved on a night when England qualify for the World Cup. I'm sure Anthony. No amazing There's something I've dreamed of since a kid But we didn't hit me until I got in the changing room seen everyone celebrating because we have a job to doing yourself Focused on doing that so when we're gonna change room, I seen everyone celebrating the music was on yeah, that's gonna hit me Yeah, you said didn't you to us in the build-up to this to these two matches that? You felt you wanted to do more with England and you must feel that you have gone somewhere to delivering that in these last two matches Yes, yeah, I think so. I think definitely the last three performances have been me best for England And I think they've got progressive progressively better, but again, I can't rest on that still feel like I do more I still feel like today I could have scored two God and assist or two so if I want to be a really top-top elite world world-level winger I've got more to do and of course the competition in Your area of the field is intense isn't it and you know, it's now World Cup places. We're talking about yeah I would never any other way. I'm not scared competition at all. I don't mind it. I think it pushes me to be better I think it pushes us all to be better. So definitely not so and I'm scared of and Most on that cherish what would it mean to you to to go to a World Cup? Everything I think every young glad in England dreams of playing in the World Cup for England So there's not many ways you can use to describe that feeling it would it would mean putting on a show to one of them games. So Listen to start in November Actually starts back a club level. So I'm not lost on the competition. I'm not lost on the fact that being successful in the qualifiers Means we go on a plane. That's definitely not the case And he's go back to club perform and get in the next camp Well done tonight and enjoy the moment That's any Gordon. Thank you very much Anthony just disappearing off. Thank you one commitment We've got Thomas to come not a million miles away Kelly as well Shall we should we chat to you while he comes over is it is he that close or what do you want to do? She's not just give us a shot when he's nearby away not far away actually so you can you can chat to me for all your life We've got John stones over in the corner as well who's also doing some talking and you know, there's a really buoyant mood I have to say I thought that was interesting about my aunt here. He comes here. He comes. I will have Congratulations. Congratulations. You've made it look easy Qualification for a World Cup, but it doesn't look easy. It is never easy even if it looks easy and we put a lot of work in Even today again today in the high press They played with a lot of short passes and a lot of short distances in the in the beginning We expected more long balls and the reaction was good. We just kept on investing And and another Another excellent team performance. It's a special moment. It comes rarely that you qualify for a World Cup so the mood is is Very very good, of course in the dressing room is all smiles music and and yeah, it's a moment to enjoy because it's a special moment Yeah, so the celebration will be there. You said you might celebrate like Senegal date, but Almost almost you can see that means a lot and it is it is different and and you cannot Create it artificially that it comes naturally and this so beautiful to see what it means for the players And of course we expect from us to win against Latvia But but the way we won first of all Gives us a lot of satisfaction and then you feel straight away. We did it six six wins six clean sheets We are there and to have this this feeling is a very unique feeling So it's a special special evening and and you can feel it in the stuff and in the players. It's good So how can you turn this to your advantage? Qualifying with two matches to spare you need to give me some time to think about it because I just know it's in half an hour That we're qualified, but we will we will Harry just said in the dressing room Let we will get this let's let's keep this thing going and in November guys when we we no one will Take a rest no one will step back and this is my feeling they're building something We are building something together. I think everyone will be delighted to be back in camp and Yeah, let's see we have some time now to decide but We want to build on what we have of course it feels like you've found a pattern you found your style You measure the two changes tonight so that continuity again And is this style that we've seen in the recent matches Is that a style of football that you will be able to play in the conditions that you will find in the United States? Adapted of course to the conditions it's different if you're playing 40 degrees in the afternoon Or if you play in a in eight degrees and and rain of course And it will come naturally you just cannot sprint and in the same amount You cannot have the same high intensity runs the game itself will be slower But there's I think in a moment. There's no no choice. We do what we do It gives us a good feeling the players buy into it and we play a we play a running game We play a high intensity game I think this reflects the English football culture and the players love it and we will adapt it when it's necessary to adapt We must be very proud of What's being achieved? I know people will say people will say you know look at the quality of the opposition etc etc But still it's 18 points is six clean sheets. So it's good and it's a special moment It's a moment for us no matter if if people might say this was easy If it looks easy it's never easy in football you have to to break down deep blocks again today and the way we did it It's it's nice to see because it's they play with a lot of effort and they just don't Don't just rely on their talent that we will score at some point So we work hard for the goals and for the chances. So it's it's good to see it's a very good moment I like it a lot. Congratulations. I'll let you go and start planning Thank you and Thomas Thomas Tuchel just turns away actually and Dan Ashworth and Mark Bullingham are just standing to my right and Debbie Hewitt as well from the FA and they've all given Thomas Tuchel a warm embrace of congratulations John Murray, thank you very much. There will of course be celebrations within The FA setup but also within that England dressing room We heard from Harry Kane from Anthony Gordon and from Thomas Tuchel about the music in the dressing room about the fact The players are all celebrating kind of what was interesting was that Anthony Gordon was so focused on this and so focused on the On the preparation on this hard work There has been a real mantra of Thomas Tuchel's that he said it wasn't till he got in the dressing room that he realized Oh, it's alright. We're allowed to celebrate this. Yeah, first of all, how good John Murray? How good is he? Oh, it's just brilliant, isn't he? But now I play with Anthony Gordon at Everton and his mentality was the same back then even a good few years ago He was a young boy coming through at Everton. He just wants to be the best He wants to if you see if he was sat here now He'd speak without a smile on his face because he's so serious in every aspect when it comes to football And I fully believe what he told us there in that interview I fully believe he was so focused on trying to be the best player on the pitch He will openly tell you that you'll want to be the best player in every opportunity that he can be you mentioned there about He thrives on the competition. I fully believe that so he should enjoy himself It's it's no it's an extraordinary feat to get yourself to a well-cooked So enjoy yourself focus on getting into that next what exactly like he said But he says the right things all the time But he really means it because he was exactly the same a few years ago when I was with him at Everton as well So England have qualified for next summer's World Cup in the US Canada and Mexico with that five-nil win over Latvia Portugal missed their chance to book a place They drew two all with Hungary a lately equaliser for Hungary in that one also in group F Republic of Ireland beat Armenia one nil that keeps their slim hopes of a playoff place still alive Earlier South Africa claimed their place. They got a three one three nil win over Rwanda So they finished top of their group ahead of Nigeria Ivory Coast in Senegal have also secured their places tonight 2022 host Qatar have also qualified and so to have Saudi Arabia",
