 We can see the players in the tunnel, Rio, when you lined up, and it's such a small international game nowadays, you probably knew quite a few of the opposition, even at international level. Did you always ignore those you knew in the opposition? Did you have a little smile and a joke with somebody on the other team that you knew well? Yeah, I went from being a joker in the pack to being the serious guy when I got to the tunnel. That was business time, that was work. That was a member here in Diocese. What were you blanking me for in the tunnel, man? And I used to be like, I don't want to talk to you. That's not the time and place to be told I talked to you after. And then some people say, are you too serious? That's the way it is. You see Wayne Rooney, he'll be focused now. He's got a job in his hand now to go out there and prove a lot of people wrong and half of the nation wrong. He's going to want to do it. He's focused. He's ready. This is how it goes. This is the business time. This is the time to go and produce the goods. Stephen Jarrod is having a word in Wayne Rooney's ear. He really is. It was almost paternal, that, wasn't it? What are your memories of Rio in the tunnel and you in the tunnel? Well, you can see how focused they are. And Rio's exactly right. This is game time. You know, one thing I miss since retired is that moment of being in the tunnel lined up against the opposition. You glance across, you have a little look at them, and you think, you know what, it's almost like Gladiators go into the arena. You know, this is where the battle starts. I think Suarez has just winked at Jarrod. As Suarez, I think, is level with Sturridge in the queue, as it were. And Sturridge is absolutely, resolutely looking forward. He could probably see Suarez in his peripheral vision. Interesting, I'm sure you saw those pictures as well, Rio. Maybe it's a final one. What Jarrod might have been saying to Rooney there, because that was a very deliberate final word, wasn't it, to England's main man? I'm sure it would have been along the lines of just do what you know, do what you do best, put that ball in the back of the net and get us to the next stage, please. Simple as that. Rio, great to have you with us. So many people getting in touch and saying so. So, thank you very much indeed for your time. Thanks, guys. Come on, England! Lovely. Rio Ferdinand with us. As the teams come out here in São Paulo, the lights are coming on. I'm pleased to say, I think they're all working the floodlights this evening, because they weren't the other day. There is definitely that pocket of blue. Las Alas, as I was saying, the sky blue or way to our left for Uruguay. Twice the World Cup winners themselves, of course, 1930, in the inaugural World Cup. And in 1950, the last time it was held here in Brazil, when they beat the host 2-1 in the last game in the Maracanar, and so upset an entire nation. England against Uruguay here in São Paulo, as we are asked to stand for the national anthem of Uruguay. Please, get up for Uruguay's national anthem. And now, the national anthem of England. And now, the national anthem of England. MUSIC Well, there's a banner in the England end which says, keep calm and prepare for Suarez. We say here on Five Live, keep calm and enjoy the commentary with us. Danny Mills is with us. Chris Waddle, Alan Green and first, his Viking. Thank you, Mark. And just to wind up the drama here, Suarez is the last in line in the Uruguayan team down there, so all the Liverpool contingent down there, most of them giving him a big hug. They'd rather he wasn't on the pitch, I'm sure. And so here we go. The last game, we were slapping on gel to keep the mosquitoes away, 35 degrees or so. We've dipped about 25 degrees. It's like an English day in November, I guess, so you can't blame the heat today if England don't make it. So England all in white with this line-up, Hart, Johnson, Cahill, Jagi Elkeren, Gerard and Henderson, Stirling, Rooney, Welbeck and Sturridge. And the much-changed Uruguayan line-up, Valero and Gull, Caceres, the young Jimenez centre-back, Godin, who's taken over as captain, Alvaro Pereira, Gonzalez, Aravallo, Rodriguez, and then Lodero playing in behind Suarez and Cavani. The referee is from Spain, Carlos Velasco-Caballo, whose chances of refereeing the final, I guess, have increased, now that Spain were eliminated from the tournament yesterday. So, Chris, the talking about to end. What are your final thoughts? I just hope that England take the game to them, play a good tempo. There's no reason why they can't play an English pace because of the conditions still England. We know this team, all right, they've made a lot of changes. They're a bit younger than what we expected, but they don't have a lot of pace in the save, especially at the back. So you want them to talk, to chase them and play a high tempo. And just before kick-off, let's go down to Ian Dennis, pitchside. Mike, very quickly, Joe Hart is so pumped up for this. You were in the bedroom when we spoke to him yesterday. We said how vocal he is. He's bounced over to this goal towards the England supporters. He shouted, come on, with so much aggression in his face three times, and then he pounded his chest. Joe Hart is pumped up as we're about to get underway. Mike. And I'd better just explain that. We were in the bedroom with Joe Hart. That's our studio in the England hotel, Ian Dennis' bedroom. So there we go. I don't know. I can see a gossip coming along there, Chris. You've started something new. So Uruguay begin. They will play from left to right in their familiar light blue shirts and black shorts, England all in white. They have their talisman back, Luis Suarez hasn't played for nearly six weeks since he got the injury playing for Liverpool against Newcastle, but so important to them. He'll start whether he can finish the game, of course. We don't know, but Uruguay will hope that he'll be on the field long enough to make the difference. As the ball is played back into midfield and the Uruguayans have much more support here, because, of course, they haven't had to travel anything like the distance, but there's still fantastic support for England away to the right. Kevani tried to flick the ball on, and Glenn Johnson just hammers that straight out of play, while England began really brightly against Italy, and they'll want to carry on that sort of trend here. Uruguay with a throw in down this near side, thrown down by Caceres, the Juventus defender. The ball comes forward for Uruguay. They've got all the possession early on. Caceres launches the ball forward, Jagi Elka lets it bounce once, clips it out of the area, it's a header from Welbeck towards Rooney, Aravallo jumps with Rooney, and now Welbeck has the ball. So, early signs here that Sterling will begin the game on the right-hand side, and Rooney down the centre with Daniel Sterridge-Chris. Yeah, we thought Rooney would go back with normal rolls. In the right, yes, that's what we expected really. As far as Uruguay, basically, a 4-4-2 with Kevani just dropping into the hole, probably doing way in Rooney's role. England now starting to get some passing momentum going. So you're listening to Five Live, your World Cup station from Sao Paulo, a gloomy day here. England must get something from the game, and hope that Italy can maybe beat Costa Rica tomorrow. The ball is played by Henderson to Welbeck. England have a chance to attack for the first time. Welbeck played it feral, far too strongly to Rooney, but it might break to Johnson. Johnson slips it forward ahead of Sterling, and the defender was there. Godin, who became such a familiar figure in the Champions League last season with Atlético Madrid, he's taken over the captaincy from Lugano. And that wasn't a great pass from Welbeck to Rooney, but England following the throw-in now down that right-hand side with the Liverpool combination of Johnson and Sterling. Here comes Geron into the penalty area, headed away by Godin. England still trying to press. Layton Baines, 30 yards out. He lays the ball in towards Sturridge, and out comes the goal. Oh, almost lost it, it was Lera. All in fluorescent orange away to our left. England just some nervous passing there. Not played with real conviction, Uruguay's keeper has it. Well, it was a good turn by Daniel Sturridge. He just didn't really judge the pace of the ball. It was a little bit over-hit by Baines, and the keeper just took his eye off it as he went to pick it up. Jagialka against Suarez did well there. Jagialka just... Interesting what Rio Ferdinand was saying about, he's got to play himself against Suarez. That's what he wants, he'll be playing for that commitment. And then looking for the mistake, ball near side with Layton Baines. Chris Waddle and Danny Mills with us here in Sao Paulo. Layton Baines plays the ball back to Jagialka. Jagialka thought about returning it to goalkeeper Hart, but now brings the ball a little sheepishly forward, and then clips along one, and that's a nameless one. England have to pass the ball better from the back than that. Uruguay near side, Casares, the ball just ricochets from team to team. And now Baines again, it's very tight down this near side. In goes Aravallo against Rooney, and then England again give the ball away. And it's over on the left-hand side with Alvaro Pereira, not Maxi Pereira, who's suspended today. And he got a great roar, did Alvaro Pereira, because he's playing for Sao Paulo at the moment here. England are now looking for Gerard to escape. Good, strong run from Gerard, and then they collided really, the Gerard and Sturridge, and the move breaks down. Uruguay now moving it up to Suarez once more. Uruguay with Cavani lurking dangerously down the centre. They have the ball with Rodriguez over on the left-hand side, taking on Johnson. Johnson does well, important challenge there from Johnson, and now Sterling to try and move out of defence. He takes on one, two Uruguayans, he doesn't go past the second, and Uruguay building again over on the left-hand side of the field. The ball played into the England area, this is dangerous for England, and when it came in, Joe Hart was very close to conceding the corner. It is a corner, corner to Uruguay over on the left-hand side. That was Suarez, what we expect, wasn't it? A little one, two giving go, terrific pace. He tries to clip the ball back, it's Kale and Joe Hart, as it bobbles to him. He's just slightly done the balance that he's left, it just crosses the lane, and it's a good decision by the Lanesmen. Uruguay have the first corner of the game, and Godine of course of Atletico Madrid, very useful from these set pieces. Cavani's at the near post. Suarez now to take this corner kick for Uruguay. And then Hart was flapping at the near post, it finally went off one of the England players, it's another corner. That nearly went in by the way, I don't know if he meant it's Willou Suarez, I think he meant to put a bit of pace on it, in swing Joe Hart, well off his lane, and he pushes it just away off Jordan Henderson, or another corner. That was dangerous, that came skidding in and caused problems. Cavani again still lurking at the near post, as the corner kick is hoisted in and headed away by Danny Welbeck. It would be not back in again by Gonzalez, and Hart is in there against Cavani, but the flag has gone up, and that's England's ball. Well that's a couple of moments of trepidation for the England fans behind Joe Hart's goal, and now they have a chance to move into the Uruguayan half. Well they've just got to settle down England, they've given the ball away cheaply on two or three occasions already, Uruguay as we thought would play better than they did against Costa Rica, and they're playing quite a fast pace, they're pressing England quite high up the field. Just looking a bit edgy early on here England with their passing, and now Welbeck reaches for the ball but only plays it out. So this new look Uruguayan team, they had to break up the back four, which has played so many times together, they've lost over 180 caps worth of players, Lugano and Maxi Pereira, and England surely will want to test this teenager playing at centre half tonight, Jimenez. Some delay while Casariz readjusts his ponytail down there, and now prepares to take this Uruguayan throw. England haven't settled down yet, Baines controls the ball, left back position, and plays the ball off his opponent Gonzalez, and England have a throwing. England nil, Uruguay nil, five live at the World Cup, England have only won one of their last five games against Uruguay, and that was the last time the sides met in a friendly downfield. Now Gerard looking for Johnson, great ball from Gerard, here comes Johnson now down the right hand side, can he deliver for England? In comes a cross, not a good cross, and Aravallo managed to get his head on it. That was the first moment for Johnson to deliver for England down the right hand side, and he didn't, and that was a major criticism against Italy. He maybe might have another chance now, Sturridge is offering himself down the right hand side. Sturridge trying to peel away from the defender. Stirling takes over, the ball just gets stuck under his feet a little, then he goes down to the ground, and he looks for the free kick, and the referee's given. It looks a little soft from here, but it's a free kick to England, and they'll take it. Well, it's a good position. I've watched Uruguayan the last game, it was definitely a foul, and D'Eiro brings him down. Stirling there, gets down, and it's a free kick, and a good position, and Costa Rica in similar positions caused Uruguay. So many problems with these set pieces. It'll be a left footer from Baines, not a right footer from Gerard. This England free kick, and they didn't really make the most of their set pieces, either in the friendly matches in Florida or the game against Italy. So now, Can Baines deliver here with this free kick for England. Here it comes, into the penalty area, headed away though by Cavani for Uruguay. It doesn't reach Rooney. Gerard gets chased down this near side, shoulder to shoulder with Suarez, who beats him easily, and then rolls the ball forward, and England have to filter back now. The ball is with Lidero down this near side, but England do come back well, and that was good work from Jordan Henderson. Nil Nil between England and Uruguay, and Casariz once more gives the youngster Jimenez, winning only his seventh cap, 19 years of age from Atletico Madrid. Jimenez, given away, Henderson pounces, plays the ball into Rooney, surrounded by Uruguayan players. Baines again, in comes the challenge from Aravalla, that's his job. The ball winner for Uruguay. Uruguay now with Gonzalez. Gonzalez moving in on, and that's out of play. England appeal for the throw in, Leinsman gives it to Uruguay. Seven nearly eight minutes gone in the first half here, at a cold and gloomy Sao Paulo. Ball thrown in, and there's nobody marking Cavani. Now Lidero. Rodriguez makes a move on the edge of the England area, onto Suarez. Suarez, which in turn was over hit, though, towards Rodriguez, and out comes Joe. Uruguay have settled more than England, they're passing the ball quite well. Uruguay are playing a good tempo, England look still very nervous. Final ball, and options are not really on at the minute, they don't look... That's a good ball from Welvack to Daniel Sterig. Sterig's going forward for England. Sterig's dirt looks for the handball, and the handball has been given against Goadie. And it's an England free kick on the edge of the area, and Goadie, the captain of Uruguay, is booked by the Spanish referee. Oh, he had to, didn't he? It's deliberate, and it's the L-A-card, which is good news for Daniel Sterig, and for England, because he didn't do anything else, and it was so deliberate. So that's good news for England, and it's a good position for the free kick, I weigh him really standing there, Leighton Baines, Stephen Gerrard starting to walk away, it looks like Ruhney's going to take it, 23-24 yards out. And it's on the edge of the D. England were on such a high, they had so much adrenaline for the opening game against Italy. They have to start all over again here, they mustn't go back at all, they must keep the tempo going. We need to get something from the game. Ruhney, who's never scored at the World Cup, is lining up this, Baines is there as well. Uruguayan Wall is being pushed back a little more by the Spanish referee, they've got the phone, and they have to stand behind it, of course. So would it be Baines, would it be Ruhney? It's Ruhney and it's wide! Just from a moment as the ball left Ruhney's foot, you were hoping the back of the net was going to be low, it's gone wide. Well, me personally, I think he should have went right, it's not far by, it's hit the station behind, which is a good yard or two, past the post. I mean, I got a new from a crow, but I remember manager told me once, Chris, you get nothing for a new. No, you get nothing either for playing well against Italy either. As well as they played, they didn't get anything from the game, they'll settle, I suppose, for not playing as well today but winning the game, and they have to get something to take into that final game against Costa Rica. England nil, Uruguay nil, flag is up and the Linesman has given a free kick for England, the foul was on Wellbeck. Just a few moments to encourage the England fans, at least when they go forward, but it's the same old story with England, when the ball's in the Uruguayan half, it looks promising, but as soon as the opposition crossed the half-way line, well, you have your heart in your mouth. Wellbeck's OK, Rooney's playing down the centre, if you've just joined us, Stirling is playing over on the right-hand side, and the England free kick has taken short. We've played 10 and a half minutes of the first half, Baines to Henderson, Johnson's calling for it over on the far side, and Jagi Elker in the end gave the ball back to Hart, it would have taken a very special ball to find Johnson, England sensibly keeping it precise, and now it's Cahill, Cahill, that's a really edgy ball by Cahill, and it's just such an obvious straightforward pass to make, and he almost put it out of play. That's another indication from here that one or two of the England players are just feeling the tension down there, but it's nil nil against Uruguay, and Johnson taking his time over this throw, Johnson's throw in the end, looped up towards Rooney, and England gain another throw, and Godin now for the rest of the game is playing with a yellow card against his knee. Throw to England, they haven't been able to test the other centre back yet. Another throw taken by Johnson, doesn't reach Stirling, Uruguay try to hack it away, Henderson will reclaim it in midfield. Gerard will give the ball back to Phil Jagi Elker, unopposed at the moment, Jagi Elker. Now Suarez comes in, oh and Jagi Elker has to be careful, he wanted too much time there, Jagi Elker, head on from Stirling to Rooney, that was a bit ponderous there by Phil Jagi Elker, he immediately acknowledges it, and I'm just wondering where we can bring Danny in from early four here, Danny 11 minutes gone, what are you thinking? The game hasn't really settled down, everyone looks a little bit nervous, a little bit jittery, are they England? They've just got to settle down, you can tell that there is a little bit of tension, wanted to needless passes going astray, but I think Suarez is going to be the key, England have got to stay concentrated in and around their own box, those defenders, those little one-twos around the England box, they're going to be the downfall if anything. Well the best way forward here obviously is for England to go forward, they just simply at this level not good enough to defend, they have to go and play to strengths, they have to look to get Stirling, Wellbeck, Rooney and Sturridge into the game, but they have to pass the ball a bit better, of course. Well the good thing about the England set up now is it's about attacking, so really the players should be looking, all should be looking for the ball and really enjoying the ball, they seem very edgy, very nervous, especially Leighton Baines there, that's his first pass completed, but go and enjoy the ball. Rooney was sandwiched in between two players there by, they haven't got Rooney on the ball really in these opening 12 and a half minutes, they've got a free kick and this free kick is just back inside their own half, just short of the half way line, it's left to Jordan Henderson, Johnson is immediately making his presence felt over on the far side, but so far hasn't delivered down that right hand side, gets into these good positions Johnson, that was a return ball from Stirling that didn't reach Johnson, England's trying to press here, trying to prevent Uruguay from clearing, now there's a chance for them in midfield, Gonzalez heads the ball back to Arevalo, he goes past Steven Gerrard and now it's Pereira the left back, back to Godi, England nil, Uruguay nil on five live, live from South Power, earlier today, Columbia beating Ivory Coast by two goals to one, just walking around at the moment Uruguay and now Kovani flicks it right across the field, great ball to Jimenez and it's with Kasseris the right back, long one from Kasseris looking to play the ball over the top, Suarez is on the run but he's offside and so Jagi Elka's volley clearance doesn't matter and England have a free kick as we get a more of a cold breeze around us here. Well you just got to watch Suarez, he plays on the shoulder, very intelligent footballer, everybody knows about Louis Suarez but you cannot take your eye off him for a minute. Henderson, back again to Jagi Elka and now Hart will need a decent clearance because Suarez is racing and he slips as he clears it but he manages to land the ball in the Uruguayan half but it's an easy header for Pereira and now Cahill and again that was an edgy ball from Cahill under pressure and the free kick is gone and Uruguay starting to commit a few fouls here. Uruguay themselves of course having lost their opening game needs something because their last game is against Italy. Layton Baines now to Henderson, Henderson pressed and then gives the ball away, that's happening too much here from England, early on. Not passing the ball as well as they did against Italy, it's Kovani now playing just behind Suarez, Kovani down this near side finds Gonzalez, Suarez is pointing, the ball is going into all of the mistake at the back by Jagi Elka and a cross shot from Rodriguez, could easily have been a goal, it's gone wide and that was really, really poor defending by Jagi Elka. It was very poor defending, just save footed away, you know it's coming, it's pitched but it's like a half volley, just put your save foot through it. Sometimes we try and clear balls with a laces and you shouldn't, it's a great effort by the way, it must have just went a half yard over the bar, it must have been a very big Joe Hart, all that was close. England very lucky there not to concede and that really is amplifiers, I think everything we feel about this England team, confident going forward, but as soon as the opposition come out then they self-inflicted some of the mistakes as well as Gerard wins the ball really well for England and the ball goes back again to Joe Hart and in some respects Rodriguez let them off the hook there because that was in his path and it was presented to him by Jagi Elka. He's looking a little bit edgy now that's a better ball from him and Sturridge is flattened by, no he's not, the referee's not giving it. He tumbles over under the challenge from Godin and the Spanish referee this time was quite happy with it. Ball down the Uruguayan left and Rodriguez gives chase, no he doesn't, it's out of play. England and Uruguay really, neither of them have settled yet have they? I think Uruguay have settled better than England, when they've got the ball they switch the play well. Cavani's took some great positions up just off Suarez in the hole, he's hard to pick up. Suarez as we know is bright but they're playing a good tempo and when the ball goes to certain areas Uruguay close England down and I'm sure listen, no he's Suarez that have said look, press England team they'll give the ball back and that's what they're doing. Well they're pressing very well especially when Rooney's in possession and Sturling as well and now Sturling manages to find some space inside the Uruguay half. Sturling's got Sturridge on the right hand side, he looked for Danny Well back in the penalty area, cross comes Caceres, Wellbeck tucks it back to Baines, Baines now with a square ball to Rooney on the edge of the area, Rooney denied first time, it's very tight as Sturling can't take it, Henderson now through to Daniel Sturridge on the edge of the area, left footed shot, clips off a defender and England have a corner kick down this near side, that was better. It was a little bit better, still frantic, you just take a little bit more time on the ball, slow it down slightly, everybody's playing far too quick, it's very hard to control a ball when you're playing that quick. And Gerard the captain will take the corner, and a lot of white shirts in that area away to our left. Two centre backs are there, Sturridge is standing inside the six yard area and Gerard prepares with this right footed corner, referee just sorting out a little bit of the usual stuff in the area, the six yard area between defenders, Sturridge of England, two players on him and the goalkeepers there as well. Rooney's trying to find some space, he raises both arms, in goes the corner kick and it wasn't well delivered, and it was headed away easily at the near post by Suarez, England nil, Uruguay nil, Johnson down the right hand side, another chance to get the ball forward, it's Wayne Rooney on the England right, that took a deflection as it came in, and Aravallo cuts it out and this is always the danger now for England as Uruguay break with Suarez down the right hand side, Kovani's making a move down the centre, Suarez tucks it back to his full back, Caceres 18 minutes gone, ball played over the field now to Alvaro Pereira, on to Rodriguez of Atletico Madrid, another player who's won over 70 caps for Uruguay, ball into Kovani, now Rodriguez once more, Uruguay didn't cut forward as strongly as they might have done then on the counter attack, they keep the possession and they move it now to Lodero and back again to Caceres and they're just comfortable in possession here, and eventually it'll be Jimenez who knocks it into the England left hand side of the defence and that was disappointing in the end for them, it's gone through to Geronimo. I'll tell you what Uruguay are doing, well which England could do a bit better, get a bit more width and switch the play, rather than pass it across the pot, make Uruguay chase, they go very narrow, save the Stirling, hang away a bit more and get a switch on a bit earlier, one ball rather than three passes. Stirling's come to the left hand side for the first time and Welbeck has moved across to the right, Stirling's chance now to take on the Uruguay defenders on the right hand side of their defence, he lays the ball off to Baines, Stirling again and that's given away by England, and Stirling tries to win it back again against Jimenez, referee's having a good look and gives the free kick against the Liverpool player, who of course was the one England player to get booked in the first game, so has to be very careful, he gets another one, then he's out of the Costa Rica game, Uruguay knock it forward, looking for Suarez, too strong for him and they really will need to play the ball into his feet because he's been out of the game for such a long time, he won't want to be chasing. He's about 75%, you can tell, you know his movement, he's normally really sharp, when he's got to run more than 5-10 yards he's really struggling to get any pace, and he's to say, get it into his feet if you want to get a bit of joy. Well it's just a psychological lift that he's given them really, his presence down there on the field, as Jagie Elka looks for Welbeck, Welbeck wriggling away from Lidero, and now Steven Gerrard, again Johnson's made that run down the right hand side, Gerrard to Johnson, Johnson goes past the defender, is there anything on the end of it? No, again, too many times that happens, it's happened in nearly all of the games he's played just recently, he gets into these promising positions, and then there's nothing at the end of it. I want to tell you a little bit of confidence in Composure, which he's obviously not got at the minute, but you've got to say so far England haven't settled, we've been playing now only on just over 20 minutes in a day, they still look very edgy, very nervous, and I don't think Uruguay's look brilliant, but they look more relaxed than the England side. Was Lera, Galatasaray, played against Chelsea in the Champions League, the goalkeeper, preparing to clear for Uruguay, Cavani's been quite ominously so far for Uruguay, such a dangerous player, can do something off the cuff and change the game, Johnson now under pressure, slices the clearance out of play, five live, 20 and a half minutes gone, Nilne. I've got to say, mate, I still think a lot of these players look a bit leggy from the first game. Jagie Elka, well, we were there and we saw four or five of them go down with the cramp, and it's a point well made, Chris. Uruguay have been able to freshen things up a little, changing half of their side, Cavani now down that far side of the field, plays the ball into the back four, and here's one of the newcomers, Jimenez. Jimenez now for Caceres, who's moved across from left back to right back for this game, Gonzalez. Caceres again, Caceres, good ball this time, into the feet of Suarez. Lidero's return ball, asking a lot of Suarez, and he looks and he, I think, probably said something as well, because that wasn't really what he wanted from Lidero, and it's a goal kick for him. No, good build up play though, again, Cavani switching the play, doesn't he, to the opposite centre half across the field, and they move the ball very quickly, it's Uruguay, and that's causing the problems, but thankfully Luis Suarez is not as sharp as he should be, or would lately be, sorry, and he couldn't catch that little one till he played. What a keyhole surgery he had on that knee. Danny Mills, what's your latest thoughts? Well, Suarez isn't moving as freely as expected, but I think Uruguay, as Chris said, have settled better, they're snapping to challenges, they're swarming round people, but the biggest problem for England is, and this has always been the problem, they panic under pressure, you know, the moment they get closed down, they don't try and keep the ball, they get erratic and they start giving the ball away. And they're giving the ball away, and this is another counter-attack now from Uruguay down the right-hand side. Cavani's looking on the edge of the area as we move towards the halfway point of the first half. Caceris now with his left foot, the ball is played in, and then that's not a convincing clearance from Gary Cahill. To throw for Uruguay down the sneer side, we are at the halfway point of the first half here in Sao Paulo. England nil, Uruguay nil, Alan Green. England's second best so far, room for improvement, but it's still Uruguay nil, England nil. Gooding, the acting skiffer for Uruguay, Flicks of All Four in the direction of Lodero, cleared by England, back into Uruguay's possession, and it's Gonzalez who moves it forward, I think Swares has a play, he is, and it's a free kick to England, couldn't agree with you more, Chris, about Swares, has been watching him very carefully the opening quarter of the game, he is not any better than 75% fit. But his very presence makes such a difference for his country. Here's Sturridge, Sturridge loses the ball, sorry Chris Gawain. I'll tell you what he's doing well though, he's one touch play when they hit it through his feet. Of course. His links have played brilliant. Discbounds playing very well, Arevalo, they had sort of been forcer in the Uruguayan midfield, he hasn't missed anything. Balls out of play, throw in to Uruguay on the halfway line in the far side of the field. It's not full, the Sao Paulo stadium, it holds 66,000 but we've got two temporary stands at either end of the grind, which will come down after the World Cup because the club doesn't want it, doesn't want the capacity this size. Now England have a throw in, Johnson to take it, 20 yards short of the halfway line. Johnson waits and waits and now throws it to Wayne Rooney who's actually struggling to get into the game, even though he's playing in his preferred position. I think England is just playing too many short passes, I think we should be 1-2 and switch the play. This is the realest place, what Uruguay are doing, they're condensing the area where the ball is. And you've got to play sometimes, just miss the midfield player, miss the extra pass, and go a little bit longer across the field and change the play and get the way it meant on the ball 1-v-1. They're just playing pass, pass, pass, it's fairly easy for Uruguay to get close to it. Aravallo to Pereira on the far side of the field, the left back for Uruguay, launching it down that flank, headed away by Cahill, finds Gerard, Gerard back to Johnson, Johnson's going to be under pressure here. Johnson curls the ball, he hovers towards safety and that's a foul by Raheem Sterling, right in front of the Spanish referee, that's a free kick to Uruguay. He's a little bit unlucky there Sterling wasn't he, good body strength to hold him off the guy, he knew he wasn't going to get the ball, he tried to nip in front, he missed it. But he's been judged as an obstruction, so this is a dangerous position, what, 20-30 yards up on the left hand side, and they've got what, five in the box, Uruguay. And Suarez is going to take the free kick, both central defenders up, Jimenez and Gideon, the captain. Suarez from the Uruguayan left, will flash the ball in right footed towards Johard's goal, there it goes, kick towards Johard's goal, good catch by the England goalkeeper. It was a good catch but it was a poor free kick on Suarez, tried to put too much on it, got under it and we've seen a lot of, to be fair, crosses and set-pieces in this tournament have been poor, and that was poor as well. But again England could have broke a little bit quicker there, they've slowed it down, let Uruguay get the shape back behind the ball. Johnson for England, still inside the England half, into Henderson, back to Cahill, and now on towards Leighton-Bain, stand the knee side of the field, the England left full back, Rooney shows, gets the pass, Rooney under pressure from Aravalo, loses it easily, Aravalo's playing really well. To Cavani, Cavani steps ahead of Welbeck approaching the England penalty area, still has the ball, flicks the ball to the right side, to Gonzalez, Gonzalez delays the cross, now he whips it in, had it away by Gerard, met by Caceres, onto Gonzalez once more. Gonzalez chips it in the direction of Lidero, it reaches Lidero, taken down off his chest, picked through towards Cavani, put behind for a corner. Well I've got to say, there's only one team playing at the minute, they have relaxed now Uruguay, England are all over the shop, there's not any composure in this side, nobody wants to put their foot on the ball. At the way it's going, Uruguay will score. Sfarra's getting a lot of stick from England fans, away to our right as he prefers to pick this corner, from the Uruguayan right. Five shirts to Amar, but it's played in low, deliberately, oh Cavani, flicks the shot over the crossbar. Well that was a well worked training, we've seen it in England many teams. Nobody's tracking. Somebody blocks him off, they jump over the ball this time, they didn't need to, he just pulls it back towards the penalty spot and Galliquiel has chased him, couldn't get there, just kind of hit the target, but it's all Uruguay at the minute. Here's Gerard de Sterling, knighted Johnson on the far side of the field, Johnson back to Cahill, midway inside the England half, to Johnson once more, a medium under pressure from Lodero, but he finds Phil Jagieelka, 27 minutes gone here in five lines, you're a World Cup Station of Brazil, 2014, lovely flick from Sturridge to Welbeck, Welbeck chases into the penalty, oh he's over running. And that was really careless, he's behind for a goal kick, what a great position, wait for it. Fantastic flick, Sturridge, and Welbeck's got pace, he's touch, he's looking, he's looking, I'll give him a little bit of help, there's nobody in there to play, nobody coming, Wayne really slay half and half possibly, but anyway it comes off his foot and it's a goal kick, a little bit better by England, Baines to Sturridge, nice flick, Welbeck over runs it. It was Lerap and his fluorescent orange goalkeeping kit away to our left, you'll not miss him. Coming forward now, drives the goal kick, deep into the England half, towards Suarez, headed away by Cajun, Baines heads it down, but only to a sky blue shirt, it's into Suarez, off his chest, back it goes, and Lodero flicks it forward, hoping to find Rodriguez, instead it's Miss Aindap, and it's through the Drew Hart, he throws it out quickly to the far side, and Raheem Sterling. No England player out there yet, can you say is really on his game. Sterling, it's about time, good dummy by Sturridge, and then he was fouled in the same movement and it's going to be a free kick doing it, just as little thanks by Daniel Sturridge, first the flick to Welbeck, then the dummy there that allowed the ball to flick to Brittany and he wins a free kick. Let's go Dean again and he's been booked by the wall, and you can say the elbow, he doesn't have Sturridge in the chin, just under the chin and the neck, so that was deliberate, that could have been another yellow, that would have been off. Well England haven't delivered well from free kicks or corner kicks, make this one better, Gerard. Towards the far side of the field, the England right, 29 minutes play, Gerard Flick, and Aindap's headed away by Gaudí, firmly away, bounces once in a time over the touch line on the far side of the field for an England throw. That was a better delivery from Stephen Gerard, wasn't it? That did ask a few questions, Gaudí did very, very well to clear his lines. Johnson, over two Liverpool colleagues to aim at, he throws it to Sterling, takes the return ball, and then his pass was short to Rooney, luckily for England it breaks the Gerard, not a Jagie Elke, and on the bank that was a terrible pass from Jagie Elke to his club colleague, and Bains is fortunate that England would have thrown. I mean, I don't mind a passing, even, it's good, but it isn't. Actually England are fortunate that it's still 0-0, half an hour played here in Sao Paulo, and if you're thinking, oh, it must be glorious weather out there in Brazil for the World Cup, it's miserable here in this mammoth capital. Gray skies overhead, freezing temperatures, not strictly speaking freezing temperatures. Oh, no, it's a far now, well back. When I say freezing temperatures, what I mean is I've got a shirt on, a sweater on, and a jacket. And of course, Danny Mills has got a T-shirt and shorts. But there you go, he's a hard man, Ardani. Free kick to England, to the left of the Uruguayan penalty area, and this is a good position for Gerard to take it. It's the same as a corner, isn't it, really? What ten yards in? Five was for Slur, I'd be slightly worried about Gerard aiming for the far corner of the net. Here comes Gerard, Bains is relatively unmarked just outside the penalty area. Gerard waits, the referee making sure the lone person in the wall for Uruguay is fully ten yards back. Now the Spanish referee is happy, now he turns himself with any pushing inside the six yard box. He steps away, Gerard still waits. 14 minutes to half time, Neil Nellons-Halpala. Gerard flicks it towards the far post, oh the header comes back off the crossbar. Good discretion, it was a way, Rooney in the far side, it was Rooney who got the head through the ball, but it came back off the crossbar. He did Gerard what I thought he would do. He had aimed at the far corner, and Rooney rose well. England closest as they're being the scoring. Must be lifted by that. Here's Sturridge, Sturridge's not, left side. The ball back to the scorer Gerard, Gerard now to Henderson. Henderson looking to find Sturridge, beaten away by Uruguay, collected by Sturley. Well-beck, on the jump, it's a better for me, there's the cross in, good discretion, Sturridge jump. But there must have been a push somewhere in the action there, because the referee's giving a free kick to Uruguay. I'm going to get a replay of Gerard's free kick, being the keeper of our post, Rooney does well to get on the end of it, it wouldn't come down. He just kind of gets above the ball to head it into the net, he's a yard and half out, he just can't get above the ball, comes off the bar and away. Oh, he's so unlucky. He was very, very unlucky there, away in Rooney. 32 minutes gone here, you're listening to 5-5, you're a World Cup station on BBC, Uruguay 0, England 0, and England must take at least a point from this game. Here's Sturley, is he losing the ball? He lost the ball, and then there was a foul on the Uruguayan player, and it's a free, oh goodness gracious, what did Sturley do there? Now Sturley pushed over to Uruguay, is he going to be yellow-carded here? The Spanish referee urging Clare back, Sturley ominously standing just a couple of yards away from Cavallo, the Spanish referee, I think he's going to get away with that. Well, it was a foul, it was... It's what he did afterwards, Christophe. There he goes, yeah, he goes down. It's not going to show that, I don't think. Suarez did take a free kick for Uruguay, who'd been better than England, but they haven't gone as close as England have to score in the opening goal. Rooney's header off the crossbar, here comes Suarez, right put it, swirling it in, headed away by Welbert, still dropping inside the England half. Nice with Pereira, the left ball back, he hits it forward, Gerard heads it clear, and Uruguay bringing it under control possession once more with Caceras, Caceras in field, and now Gonzalez, and he all goes on to the far side of the field, and Suarez trying to pick the ball forward to a colleague, and in England, actually, is Liverpool colleague Johnson, and it's out for Uruguay throwing, which has been taken. Now on the far side, Pereira to the captain, Goading, back inside the Uruguay half. England have only storage inside the Uruguay half, down the Uruguay left, and it goes to Suarez, Suarez picks the ball forward, again it took out a flexion of England almost ran to Loderro, and it's played back by Cahill to heart and heart clears it up field. Now headed away by the 19 year old Jimenez, England have the ball though, good pass by Henderson to the left side, and Baines, Baines' night to Sturridge, Sturridge being hustled by two players, loses the ball, and then Baines moves it back for England, but over aggressively according to the Spanish referee, that's a free kick. No, it's just not enough options, I think that was a good ball by Jordan Henderson to Baines, it's the first one we've really saw, which is what, 20-25 yards, where they've pinged it out a lot earlier, and that's where they're going to get the joy, get the full back step in, get the ball on earlier, but then saying that, the full backs have got to use the ball a lot better than what they are. Danny Mills is just sitting a few yards to my left, Danny, 10 minutes to half time, is it any better? No, not massively, honey, you guys have summed it up pretty well, but Uruguay, they're still snapping to challenges, I think they're working almost a little bit harder, but Chris is right, just need a little bit more composure on the ball at times, they want to put their foot on it, you know, Steven Gerrard's got to start bossing that midfield area, apart from that, it'd be very unlucky for Mouayn Rouni, he was almost too close to the goal, you know, and he initially, he rose at the far post, it hit him, and he had no chance of getting that down, that's the only England's only real bright moment, they've got a very young centre half, Jimenez, Uruguay, still untested really. Uruguay now, England now, in the last 10 minutes of the first half, well back, to Sterling, and then Sterling's pass to Rouni, Rouni was fouled, that's a free kick to England, Henderson wants to take it, he does take it quickly, whips it away to the far side, and Glenn Johnson, Johnson 20 yards over the half way line, in to Sterling, Sterling's just again to float, what's he thinking there? At least 35 yards of goal, Schuetz left footed, high into the Uruguayan fans behind the goal. Listen, the only thing you'll say on any of these defences is a confident lad at the minute, why not, listen, it doesn't matter about that, it's gone, he was positive, he took the chance already, it's gone high and weighed, but that's what you want, you're centre forward with confidence. Don't forget that Italy play Costa Rica tomorrow, if this is a draw at Italy, big Costa Rica, Italy will be through, and then the remaining place will be between the Costa Ricans, England and Uruguay, that's assuming this is a draw, and my money's always been in this one being a draw. Later tonight by the way, Japan and Greece kicks off at 11 o'clock UK time, on the far side of the field, Daniel Sturridge, when he gets the ball, you know, there are always two Uruguayans on him, they are concerned about Sturridge, here's Sterling, Sturridge wants more, inside right channel, and that's a good ball to the left side, inviting the run from Leighton Baines, Baines reaches the pass, Baines deep just inside the corner flag, crosses into the penalty area, but it's clear away, one point to the side turning and throwing. I said at the start of the game, the joy is the two full backs, they've got to switch the play like that, Sturridge has bought two Baines early across the field, missed the midfield out, don't be afraid to go direct and go across the field, switch the play as quick as possible, that's where you get your space and joy. Well that was terrible from Wellbeck, from the England throw in, England rather forced it to get the ball back, Gerard to Cahill, Henderson says give it to me, Henderson gets the ball, just inside the centre circle, slips it forward to Sterling, Sterling now to Rooney, and Rooney sees Johnson run down the right side and he flicks the ball towards the England ball back, Johnson brings it under control off his chest, Sturridge takes it off, Sterridge is tackled and it's out off Perera for another England throw, this has just been a better spell for England the last few minutes. Yeah they're moving the ball quicker with a bit of purpose and it's getting to the targets, they've struggled to get targets and hit the people they've been looking at, they've been too slow, another up the tempo. Sterling, to Henderson, onto Rooney, but it was a poor ball to Rooney, he really couldn't do much with it and it's taken up by Uruguay again, still 0-0 here in Sao Paulo, oh and they break forward to the derro, the derro good pass Gerard there and he plays the ball to Cavani, Cavani just outside the penalty area, flicks it towards the far post, there's a chance, oh and it is Luis Suarez, it had to be that fan, Luis Suarez with a four-metre into the far corner of the net and the seven minutes to go to half time, the man we all feared has scored for Uruguay, Suarez, Uruguay won England 0. I've got to say it's a very, very well worked goal, the weight of every pass there was absolutely quality, they broke on England, they pinched the ball off them, they've got Runas Cavani on Johnson and we all thought Cavani when he cut and stayed on that right foot, we're waiting for that bend to the top corner and he plays the most beautiful little chip. Gondero gets out the back four, lovely weighted pass, now he comes inside and we all think he's going to wrap his foot around it and what a lovely weighted pass to run by Suarez, far post in the header, it's absolutely brilliant, back across Joao, into the bottom corner and it has been coming. Just an astounding header from Suarez because the ball actually was going towards his left side and somehow he pivoted his head and he headed firmly past Joao. Danny Mills, what a goal for Uruguay. Very disappointed for England, Stephen Gerard robbed on the half way line and as Chris said, when Cavani broke we thought he was maybe going to go for the curler but he didn't, he had composure, that one little thing that England have missed so far in this game, he dinked the ball, Jag Yelka lost his man, a great little bit of movement from Luis Suarez, just peeled off on the far shoulder. Jag Yelka, he's got to be aware of that, this is international football, you know the movement of Luis Suarez, he just pulled off and it was a great little header, back across Joao Hart who had absolutely no chance and well, I worry for England now because they could easily get hit again on the counter attack. Here's Rune though, England need to respond quickly, it's played towards Sturridge, Sturridge hit in the penalty, good shot on target, good save by Mousler. Well good opponent here for England, Suarez give the ball away cheaply, trying to pass in side, Rune nicks it, lovely way to pass, the pace of Sturridge gets him that two, three yards, they allow him to turn onto that left foot, maybe shoot across the goal, if you're critical, he goes near post, it's a comfortable save. Five minutes to half time on five live, you're woke up station on the BBC, Gerard to take the corner from the left, he's going to play it in right footed, a little bit of pushing inside the six yard box involving Cahill and Godin, the referee talking to both of them, Gerard meantime waits and waits and now he delivers right footed, deep away from goal, allowed to run a long way, Rune collects it just to the right of the penalty, of course it takes a deflection and it'll be in the other corner doing it, this time from the far side, the right. Well it's a good response by England, Sturridge shot one corner and Gerard, Rune tries to put it back in, he works the corner, he's taken himself from that right hand side. Rune this time takes the corner, England pushed over, I think Jack Yelke pushed over in the six yard box, back in his feet now, Rune delivers, right footed to the near post, another great delivery, headed away by Uruguay, Rune on the bully, smashing the ball into the penalty here, this time on a ball of clears, three and a half minutes to half time, England trail Uruguay, one nil and the England fans could boo Swares all they like, the man is quality, Swares goal, but here's Sturridge, another Liverpool player, keeping the ball into the Uruguay penalty here and it's headed behind for a corner. I've got to say it's a good response by England, developed the tempo, whether Uruguay or Leic teams still trying to protect the lead up the half time, they've dropped off, but England's had a good response. And this is better, instead of Rune taking the corner right footed to the right side, let Baines swing it in left footed, let's put pressure on Miss Lara's goal. Remember Rune headed off the crossbar from Charles Dreeking, Baines drives it in towards the near post, Aravallo heads it away, another corner for Leighton Baines to take, inside the final three minutes of the first half here, Uruguay won, England nil, the assistant being a little pedantic, but making sure the ball's inside the quadrant, Baines signals, right arm along, drives it in towards Weldwick and the near post, hitting Uruguay and defender, it actually hit Luis Suarez, he's everywhere Suarez, and he's only 75% fit. Here's Johnson for England, trying to get an equaliser before half time. Remember how quickly we responded when Italy went in front, that was within two minutes, not so this time and certainly not so from that touch by Sturridge, either play for the Uruguayan flow and they can settle things down now. They're just getting a replay of the goal here, the ball from Kavan, he's absolutely fantastic, but the header, that is all your neck muscles and it's how he's got it back across the goal, he's on his heels and he's headed it back, he's wrong footed Joe Hart, he can't do anything about it, it's a wonderful pass and what a header that is. 11 goals in qualifying for Luis Suarez, 11 goals and he scores here, and I saw Roy Hudson's press conference the other day when he was asked about Suarez and he said, is he world class? Oh well, you've got to do it at a world cup to show you're world class. Well that's nonsense Roy Hudson, Suarez is world class and he's shown it here today, not fully fit, but score of a brilliant goal, 90 seconds left in the first half, Uruguay, lead England, 1-0, Baines to the left side, Baines was caught there by Gonzalez and that's a free kick. I don't always say this thing about you've got to do it at a world cup, wonderful players who are great, who've never been to one. Yeah, absolutely, George Best was never a world class player of course, because he never played at a world cup. From the free kick, here's Baines coming forward, Sturridge is nearby, Baines held on to the ball, Caesaris took it off him and Caesaris clears, but only to Wayne Rooney, and Rooney missed that ball, allowed it to travel to the Jaguilca, now he's got it, Rooney hits it crossfield at the far side in Johnson, final mid of the first half here on five line, Uruguay, lead England, 1-0, and Uruguay just digging in here, making sure they don't concede an equaliser before half time. Ideal game plan, get your nose in front and then suck England back in, let's defend a bit deeper and we'll catch them on the break again and here they go. As a wasted throw in, Caesaris perhaps not showing the sharpness of his feet, his brain is, he didn't run away there from the England player, and in the end had to fire him and it's a free kick to England, just on the edge of the centre circle, Gerard takes it, Gerard clicks it towards Sterling, headed out to play by Pereira, 45 minutes is up, and the fourth official tells us he's got one added minute and we're into it, Johnson, throws it high, again straight on to a Uruguayan head, Pereira with an automatic clearance, as Suarez clicks it back but it comes out off of Uruguayan inside, playing the far side in the field, throw another far side in the field, Johnson takes it, gets it back from Sterling and then Johnson runs it out of play, and that symbolises much of England's carless play in the first half. I've got to say Alan, going into half time, if England want to win this game, you've got to get your two full backs working with the ball, using the ball, that's where the space is, diagonal balls across the other full back, you've got time, you can move forward and you're looking to pass quality crosses, whatever you need, hit the minute, the two full backs are given the ball away every time they get it, we can't build anything. They're worried about Suarez, every time he gets the ball, those two central defenders for England, there was another occasion there when it really should have been cleared simply and wasn't, there is the half time whistle. Well, Uruguayan's front, and it's got to be said, Chris, they deserve to be in front. I've got to say, yes, I totally agree with you, England have not turned up so far, yes, they've had a little spell, really hit the ball from Gerrard's free kick, far from that, they haven't really offered anything, a storage shot, it's been all Uruguay for me, who've dictated the pace of the game, they've had a better movement, they've played the better football, and they deserve the one to lead. And you're just switching on to five line, first of all, where have you been? Uruguay lead one-nil, guess who's got the goal? Suarez has got the goal. Ian Dennis is at the touch line. I don't know, there was a few boos from the England supporters over my right shoulder and that half time whistle sounded, created very little of course in open play. When Joharth conceded the goal, he hurled the ball towards the centre circle and then immediately shrugged off that disappointment because he tried to make a point of trying to rouse his teammates, but England haven't performed as well as they did in Manaus. Remember, 1954 was the last time that England failed to emerge from three games in a World Cup and now if it stays like this, they're going to hope that results are going to have to go in their favour unless there is a drastic improvement in the second half. We've seen it so many times, haven't we Danny Mills, an inability to keep the ball under pressure, but also with that goal, two Uruguayan attackers, six England players, the two score against the six. How come? Well, Stephen Jarrod wasn't strong enough on the half-way line. Sometimes you've got to make a foul. If you get done, you've got to bring someone down. You might have to take a booking for that. Yes, it's not right if you like, but you've got to be clinical. But then as the ball goes forward, Louis Suarez just runs off the back of Phil Jagyalka. I don't want to dig him out, but he doesn't look around. He doesn't know where Louis Suarez is, and he just pulls off two yards. As a centre-back, and we had Rio Ferdinand on earlier, you've got to have your head on a swivel. You've got to be looking always over your shoulder. If the centre-forward can see the number on your back, you are in trouble. And that's exactly what happened. Didn't know where he was. Great little ball and a fantastic little dink over the top and a great header. And Chris, you're worried about England's energy levels? I just don't think we've got any. The players were wont. Sturridge showed a couple of chances. Stirling just kind of break Gallup for me. He's gone past one player, and that was it. Doesn't look fresh, and there's a lot of the players that look very heavy-legged. You've got to say, they've made five changes, really. England haven't been to 11. I'm sure now Roy Otschel will be looking and thinking, I need energy. And then the full-back levels, you've got to get a bit more quality, or we're going to play the praise. Well, England at the moment are going to go out the World Cup effectively if they lose this. Danny, what do you think that he's thinking about at halftime in terms of changes? Bearing him by what Chris said, that maybe the energy levels are really down. I think I'd like to see at least one change. I think Adam Larner could be a bonus. I know he's not the quickest. But he keeps the ball. He could be that link between the midfield and the fence. Wayne Rooney's got to be very, very careful that he doesn't get carried away now. We've seen him before where he tries and does too much. He almost comes up, he wants to do goal kicks, throw-ins, corners, penalties, whatever it is. He's got to stay disciplined and use his energy in the right areas. OK, second half commentary to come here from Sao Paulo, Uruguay, one up, and then the highlights on BBC One tonight from 10.35.

I played the ball around nicely and I'm hoping the second half can get a bit better. What do you think of Louis Suarez's goal though? It was a class goal, wasn't it? It was a well taken goal. That's what he's got and that's what we had to be aware of. He comes after injuring, does that to us. We went 1-0 down again since we came back goal-to-goal. So hopefully we can do the same again and improve on that as well. But truly and honestly, are you feeling confident? I'm a bit nervous at the moment because Suarez is on the pitch, but I still think we can do it. Come on, England! There you go, Ma. There is hope on the beach on Cuckabada. Thank you very much indeed, Juliet. England have got to get back into this. Otherwise, effectively, it's all going to be over under a week from starting. Danny, we've had a look at the goal several times. Louis Suarez doesn't make a jinking run. He doesn't go left and then goes right. He runs pretty much in a straight line behind Jagie Elka. We're keeping an eye on Jagie Elka here. Had a quick look at him about 45 yards from goal, then keeps his eye on Kovani all the way. That's basic, isn't it? He just runs behind Jagie Elka. He sees him about 25 yards from goal and then just takes his eye off him. You know, there's three players around Kovani. Jagie Elka just loses his man. No idea where he's going to run. Suarez, he runs. He just checks his run a little bit. He just changes a little bit of tempo. But that's not good enough. For international level, you've got to know where he is. Jagie Elka jumps in the end, but he's just jumping it into nothing. He's hoping that the ball hits his head. Good movement from a great little ball. What a ball from Kovani, because he actually fates across that first time, doesn't he? And then just a little sand wedge, isn't it, Chris, over Jagie Elka's head? But surely the Everton man's got to know it no more. For me, Danny, you were a full-back. Glenn Johnson should get closer than he does to Kovani. He's five yards off. Watch when he gets it. He never, ever goes to the ball. He stands off him because he knows he's going to get done. So he backs off him and he lets him cross it. And listen, it only takes a split second. You know when you've got that much quality, you can do balls like that. There's not many players can do that pass and see that pass. Kovani can. That's why he's worth 55-65 million quid. So we thought for a second that we might be able to work out who the half-time subs were, because Milner, Alana and Wilshire will warm you up fairly vigorously. Then Lampard's gone to join them. It could be, Chris, from your point of view, does this seriously look like a three-substitute second half? No. At some stage. Yes, definitely. I think he'd be... I'll tell you what, I'll be looking at you. He doesn't want to do one immediate left-hand. Definitely within ten minutes, it still looks flat and there's no legs. Milner will come on and do a right-side or left-side job. Lampard will get your goal. I don't think he'll come on straight. We have got to say, but I can see Lelana coming on for Welbeck. Maybe Milner will steal him. But stealing for me looks so heavy-legged. He's got no goal and no sprint in him. He doesn't got his pace. He's not really effective. When it's all over, tonight there'll be a 6-0-6 with Mark Chapman and Danny Murphy. The usual number with the lines about to open. 0-500-909-6-93. That's the number 85058 on the text. And at BBC Five Live on social media, use the hashtag, BBC World Cup. This is pretty serious from England's point of view. We've got to keep making this point. They're not definitely out if they lose England, but to all intents and purposes they will be. If they lose this, they are clinging on by their fingernails. They won't be out until proper possibly tomorrow, but pretty much so. I think he's going to have to change the formation. Play Gerrard as the out-and-out holding player. Push Jordan Henderson forward. Maybe play Frank Lampard alongside him. You might have to sacrifice Sterling, Welbeck, and play Runeo Stoge. Almost play a diamond, if you like, in midfield. You've got to change something, because at the moment, England are getting swarmed on. There's too much panic. Bring a Lallaneron, bring a Frank Lampard on. Someone that's confident on the ball to put their foot on it and able to say, actually, just calm things down. Let's pick a pass and pick the right pass, rather than panicking it and just giving it back to the Uruguayans. The reality is, I'm afraid, that Gerrard has struggled a little bit in this world. Cup hasn't he, Danny? It's been tough for him. At Liverpool, he's the main man, and the game is set up around him. A little bit like when Mourinho said, Matta at Chelsea. Matta was the main man, and everything was planned around him. Likewise, at Liverpool for Gerrard. This England team isn't quite the same. It gets exposed at times. It's going to be a very, very tough second half now. I don't think there's... It looks like it's just seen the plays in the tunnel. It doesn't look like there's going to be any changes at half-time if my count is correct, but give it five minutes, and he's going to have to make some sort of change. England are right up against it here in Sao Paulo. 6-0-6 on the way when it's over. The line's open now. 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. England looking extremely serious and full of intent, and they're out comfortably before Uruguay, because time is running out on their World Cup just at the moment, unless they can turn it around. Lugano, the injured captain, getting his team going. We should say Uruguay very lucky to be playing with 11 men. Godin should have been sent off. No question about that for a second yellow card, but he wasn't. He wasn't, and that's not the reason England are losing, and that's not the excuse. Danny with a Chris Waddle, Alan Green, and Mike Ingram with Mike Ingram with it all to do in this second half here in Sao Paulo. Well, I go back to Gerrard's press conference yesterday, and he said simply, if we can get our defensive side right, then we should be OK. And if you think about the Italy winning goal, that was across from the right-hand side, headed in by Balotelli, who had problems between Banes and Jaguilca. Today, we've had a cross from the left-hand side, headed in by Suarez, and again, Johnson could have been tighter, and Jaguilca certainly could have done better. And Uruguay, by the way, have got a 19-year-old centre-back, Jimenez, who has not been tested at all. Right, England all-in-white kick-off. I'll remind you of their line-up in just a few moments. And hopefully Roy Hodgson has managed to get his message across, because the way things are going, if it stays like this, then unless Italy win all of their games, they're at England around. And even then, of course, they would have to beat Costa Rica, and it could come down to goals and all that sort of stuff. England have to get something from this game. Cahill, long ball forward, given away, straight away, straight to Arevalo, and that really isn't good enough at the start of the second half, if England are to build up some momentum. Their team is Hart, Johnson, Cahill, Jaguilca and Baines, Gerrard and Henderson, Sterling, Bruni, Welbeck and Sturridge. Uruguay with Maslera, Cazares, Jimenez, Godin and Pereira. And then Gonzalez, Arevalo, who was fantastic in the first half. I thought Lidero, Rodriguez, Suarez and Cavani. England stand off at Arevalo, who gets possession following the throw. But instead of drizzling the air, is Uruguay put a long ball forward towards Suarez, Suarez has it now, given to him from Rodriguez. Suarez bends the ball in, Jaguilca heads it away, not too convincingly. Gonzalez retrieves over on the far side, Cavani and Suarez are both in the area. 1-0 to Uruguay at the start of the second half. Uruguay make a mistake, England have a throw. Well, not a great start by England, Uruguay again, took the initiative. And Roy Odton will just get in the camera shot of them, they're going to be thinking how long is it before they make a couple of changes. Cozinga, Vindal, struggling, they look flat, a few of them look very leggy. And there's not a lot of confidence in the side at the minute. I always felt psychologically it was going to be hard for them because they were so mentally tuned in and prepared, all the preparation for that Italy game, having gone to Florida to adjust to the temperature. They played well, they got nothing from it, now they have to go again and they must make changes soon if they're going to get back into this game. Roy Hodson presumably will give it 10 minutes or so, as now Pereira was fouled by Sterling, was he? He's certainly looking for the foul. Sterling remember a yellow card and he's banned from the next game. Throw into England, Johnson to take it. Uruguay lead through the goal from Luis Suarez, headed goal, brilliantly taken. And for him of course, this could easily be his last chance in the world cup. He'd be in his 30s the next time and Uruguay have to qualify, of course, for Russia. So this will be his stage in South America. He's targeted this game for a return, now fouled by Sterling and these are not good early signs for England. Two minutes gone. They just look flat, listen, confidence is a massive thing in football. Anybody will tell you, at the minute you've got Uruguay players who are really enjoying the game, considering the way they played against Costa Rica. This is a different performance, which we all thought it would be. But they're full of confidence, they've got the goal in front and I think the presence of Suarez has brought that confidence to the team. Just them being out there. Lampard is certainly one player I would turn to now for some stability and some control. England have none of that in the first half and Uruguay got a corner, which Johnson is disputing. So corner kick to Uruguay down this near side. Suarez will come across to take it. Lots and lots of Uruguayan fans behind the goal being defended by Joe Hart. England with a defence, without John Terry, without Ashley Cole. This is always going to be a problem for them in this tournament. And Suarez has a little fan club down there, as he prepares to take this year. England mustn't concede another one here, they're trading by one goal to nil. Suarez preparing to take the corner. Caceres and Cavani's both in the air, and it almost went in. It would have been an own goal, I think, from someone. The ball flashed across, Joe Hart had no idea where that was. In fact, he's looking absolutely aghast at the moment and screaming at his defenders. The ball is out of play over on the far side. Caceres was in there, causing problems at the near post. England could so easily now be two down. Who's blocking? Who's the first man? Who blocks that in case you do hit it low? Look, it's Danny Welbeck, and Joe Hart gets it away. He definitely didn't cross the lane, but Suarez, that's twice he's trying to do that in the up post. Suarez with a little volley following a throw in for Uruguay. Uruguay getting with Caceres over on that right-hand side. It would have been a Welbeck own goal if Joe Hart hadn't managed to keep it out. England under pressure. Suarez now feeds off the throw. Drills the ball, it travelled a very long way. Somebody needs to get a boot on this, they haven't. Shot clipped in by Gonzalez. England all over the place, conceded a corner, and Gerard claps his hands. But at the moment, England are heading out of the World Cup, and Suarez will make a long, slow stroll to the far side of the field. England didn't deal with the last corner. And here comes another one, another test for Hart and his defenders. The young Jimenez, 19 years of age, goes into the penalty area away to our left. Godine as well is going to run in with this corner. Taken now by Suarez, headed out of the area by England. Nobody claims it from a white shirt. Aravallo tried to arrow the ball to the far side, still Uruguay pressed, and Suarez could be on goal here. Suarez takes a shot on, and it's gone wide, well wide in the end. And what on earth is happening out there? Well, we did that. Hey, wingman's a back four, I've got to say, and it's not proven wrong, either. They've been all over the shop. Nobody taking charge. They're scared of the ball. They just can't defend, they're not picking anybody up. It's OK having this youthful exuberance going forward, but you have to have a balanced team. And in the World Cup, fine margins, you get punished if you can't defend. And England at the moment are fortunate only to be 1-0 down, I think, now, Chris. I totally agree with you, mate. I think it's all Uruguay, the team with the initiative there. Look at the joe hards coming away now. Terrible points. No composure there from the goalkeeper heart. And Uruguay are on the ball with Lidero and back to Caceres. Caceres now launches it long to this near side of the field. I have to tell you, I don't think Uruguay are a great side by South American standards. They had to get through a play-off, but they're better than England at the moment. Now Kavani goes into the area. Suarez trying to peel off, and England get it out, not very far. And then comes in, and there's a nice bit of play from Welbeck. Can England counterattack? Welbeck's ball to storage was too short. And the young defender, Jimenez, did well there. Game opens up, and Gerrard has to be careful not to concede a foul here. Rodriguez is looking for it. It's Henderson rather. Henderson didn't conmit the foul, but the play goes on, and Lidero through to Kavani on its way from Kavani. That was the moment for Uruguay, really, to seal it. England's so fortunate. That should have been game 2 now. They're all over the shot, England, at a minute. And Kavani, he has got quality. He'd be really disappointed. He didn't hit the target, and Brown-Jo Harbour. England all over the shot at the moment. It's all Uruguay, and they'll be thinking, let's get his second goal and kill the game off, because there's always going to be a chance England will come back into it. He's got the subs warming up. I think you've got to do it now. Well, England fell apart defensively at the last World Cup, but that was against a German team, which is much better than this Uruguayan side, but Uruguay are good enough at the moment, and they really should have won the game by now. The ball is with Starridge over on the far side, pushed over. Manet wasn't, referee was happy, and the ball is cleared by Uruguay back into the England half. So it is a problem for England, as Uruguay fills her back once more. We're bringing down the Mills again in a moment. Johnson's ball for Rooney to chase down this near side. Rooney also looking a little bit leggy at the moment, trying to turn Godin. Stillway and Rooney need some support. Aravallo was there, and Uruguay swarmed around Rooney, and nobody was really helping Rooney out. Nobody's really taking responsibility down there for England, and it's a throw in to be taken by Glenn Johnson. Bringing down the Mills just after this next move breaks down, and England had the ball, so it should break down fairly soon. Rooney, Rooney into Sterling, back again to Rooney. It's a little slow from England. Now Rooney right across the field, ambitious ball, it doesn't reach Leighton-Baines, but a poor headed clearance. Henderson now to Welbeck, not a good return ball. Johnson's going clattering in. Danny, quick thought. I think Uruguay just wants it more. They're snapping into challenges, swarming around people. Their attitude is much, much better. Chance for England now, the Uruguay! Gold keepers made the save. Rooney's moment, Gold Keeper-Mazlera stood up firm in the Uruguayan goal. That was a chance of an equaliser. Suddenly Rooney almost pounced. Johnson near side, tangled up a bit against Cavani, who's coming back to help his defenders, and England have a throw. At least the first time I really saw England, second half definitely in the box, and it was a good ball in by Baines. Sturridge misses it, and it just comes to Rooney. Does everything right, his first touch is immaculate, he smashes it with his left foot, and he's got to say to keep out of the right place, good save. Gerrard stands over this England free kick, near side the right. Uruguay lead 1-0, and we've played nine minutes of the second half. In goes the kick, it's a big deep one to the far post, and God eans there. I'm told that England have never come from behind to win a World Cup game, having gone behind in normal time, they've done it in extra time. This is the moment they'll be happy for a draw, they'll be happy to get something from the game. They trail 1-0, and we've played ten minutes of the second half. When they go forward, there are possibilities, but the trouble is whenever Uruguay cross the halfway line, they look like doing damage, and they should have finished the game off by now. Baines, ball into the area, and Muzler is there once more, diving at the feet of Danny Wellback, and immediately the Uruguayans will pile in, and try and get the game stopped here, and Muzler, of course, is going to feign a little bit of injury too. Yeah, exactly, he's trying to get him booked really, let's be honest. Great ball in by Layton Baines, it's nice to see how it's two balls, he's got forward and he's got good deliveries in, and that's what we need from a full box, quality going in the box, this is a great ball, wrapped his foot round it, no one hard in here, but Danny Wellback's got to go for it, he has a lunge, yes, he does catch him on the knee when you see the replay, so you can see why Uruguayan players are a little bit upset, he's not, roughly, said anything. Ten minutes gone, one meal to Uruguay, Danny Mills, cutting short there because of the Rooney opportunity, what more would you like to say? Well, it was a great opportunity for Rooney, I think he did incredibly well, he just hit it instinctively, unfortunately straight at the goalkeeper. The last couple of minutes has been a little bit better, but as I said beforehand, these England players do not leave anything out there, and at the moment Uruguay look hungrier, they look like they want it more, they're snapping into the challenges, they're working a little bit harder, England have got to step the game, but the last thing you want to do as a player is get back on that plane, or get back in that dressing room and think, you know what, I could have done a little bit more, I could have tried a little bit harder. Well, there have to be changes soon by Roy Hitch, let's go down to pitch side and Ian Dennis. Yeah, that incident might rise in front of me, no malice whatsoever intended by Danny Well, but Maslera really feeling the effects of that on his left knee, but the Spanish referee straight away said to the Uruguayan players, there was no intention, no foul. Thank you very much indeed, Ian, so the ball is out of play over on the far side, and we're looking down to see who's warming up down there, we're also getting pitchers as Latin Ibrahimovic who's here, watching the game of course. Great player not to be involved in the World Cup, so all those players down there really privileged to be here, when you think that player like Ibrahimovic, who was denied by Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal in the playoff, England have to get a goal, they have to get something from the game, Banes now, down the line to Wellbeck, Wellbeck in now to Daniel Sturridge, Sturridge heavily marked, back to the left-hand side, Uruguay clear, and the whistle's gone, there's a foul given against Banes, is it over on the far side? And this is something else that England really can't afford, they can't afford this game to keep stopping all the time, breaking up all the momentum, but Uruguay is so used to this, defending a 1-0 lead, but England now still not testing for me this young man at the back. Referee from Spain is calling over Leighton Banes once more, the incident was between Banes and Caceres, but all this is part of the gamesmanship really from Uruguay, they're in control, they're going to try and disrupt the game as much as they can now, and in the meantime when they get the ball forward, Suarez will be hoping that Cavani can feed him a game like he did for the Uruguayan goal. Ball to this near side, Rodriguez getting above Johnson, Cahill didn't really control his header out of defence, neither did Gonzalez control his header, and now Wellbeck gives the ball away, and he ought to be one of the players soon I think to come up, but he's not really making any inroads over on that left-hand side for England, and Sterling's not in the game either at the moment in this second half. England bringing the ball out of defence on five-live, Uruguay leading 1-0, Jagi Elka clears downfield, this has to reach Rooney, Rooney was waiting for it to come to him, and also waiting for the challenge to come in, and both players feel that, it was Jimenez who came in with the challenge, and Rooney in the end gets the free kick that he was looking for. They've just got scrappy a little bit Uruguay at the minute, and England are obviously pushing and trying to get back into this game, they've had a couple of opportunities, and Uruguay have gone deeper, and they've stopped passing the ball around Uruguay. Henderson back to Baines, Jagi Elka now onto Danny Wellbeck, Jagi Elka again needs to get the pass right to Gerard, Gerard will really need to have to impose himself now over this final period, that was a poor first touch by Daniel Sturridge, Aravallo's clearance, Ricochet's away from Uruguay, and a lovely ball from Henderson, finds Leighton Baines over on the far side, now can Baines deliver a cross for either Rooney or Sturridge, no he's played it back short to Henderson, Henderson charges forward, Gallup's run a few challenges, shot is driven in, and it's good handling by Muzlera, the Uruguayan goalkeeper. Well it was a shot, but sometimes they've come crosses and somebody gambles and just gets ahead of the keeper and nicks it in doesn't it, but nobody took the gamble, so you just put it down as a shot. 14 minutes gone in the second half earlier today, Columbia 2 Ivory Coast 1, and Dennis rejoins us again, pitchside in. Ross Barclay's about to come on, Mike, we said that Roy Hodgson couldn't afford to leave it too long to make a change, he hasn't, just before the hour, Ross Barclay preparing to come on. Thank you, that was a ball just hoofed out of the defence, really by Jagi Elka, then Sturridge turns slowly and didn't give Sturling any chance to receive possession, and Godin, who's perhaps lucky to be on the field, having already got a yellow card for Han Ball and another challenge on Rudi, which was a long ball forward now for Suarez, and Cahill needs to get tight here against Luis Suarez, he's just ushering him towards the touch line, and Cahill in the end did pretty well, because that's going to be a goal kick, a slap on the hand from Jagi Elka, and now Hart finds Banes over on the far side, on five live, it's Uruguay 1, England 0, we've got two balls on the pitch at the moment, and now Welvink trying to wrong foot the defender over on the far side, England have a throw in, but they're starting, starting, the clock is ticking for them now, just half an hour or so to go, they don't win the game, they are effectively, if not mathematically, out of the World Cup, ball with Johnson down this near side, Sturridge looking to come short, the ball play from Johnson to Jera, oh Jera almost squeezed that through to Sturridge, now it's Sturling, Sturling can he take on Kavani here down the right, he's gone past Kavani, goes past the second defender, another defender in the way, looks for the penalty kick, but it was a very obvious attempt as well, it has to be careful here not to get a yellow card for that, it's a gold kick, and now there's an Uruguayan player, he's needing attention. He's lucky by the way, Sturling, I've just saw him replaying, he throws himself to the floor, yes there's a couple of challenges came in, but that one actually didn't really touch him and he went to the ground, and you can see why Uruguayan defenders weren't happy, but somewhat he's really in trouble by the way. It's Alvaro Pereira, the left fullback, and they are actually showing a bit of concern down there, they're ushering the doctor on, as quickly as possible to look at him, he's lying on his back, Alvaro Pereira, he's talking and speaking to them, but there is concern. It was a knee in his head off Sturling, so he's possibly got concussion there, that's what it's about. He's caught him really with his knee full on into his side of his head, as he slayed and tackled to block him, he's caught him heavily with his knee Sturling there, actually Denly. If he can't carry on to Chile he would have to come on, Ian Dennis joins us again. I'm restricted through the mesh of the netting to see the activity going on with the Uruguayan physios, however with that substitution, Ross Barkley was about to come on before Raheem Sturling went on the attack into the penalty area, the 19 of Raheem Sturling was shown, Raheem Sturling was about to come off, Gary Neville had slapped Ross Barkley on the back to give him some encouragement, then changed his mind, Ross Barkley is now coming back to the touch line after sitting on the bench and I just wonder if they've now changed their minds and it isn't Sturling coming off, because clearly on the electronic board it was the number 19 of Raheem Sturling, Ross Barkley is about to come on and I think there might have been a change of heart, we'll wait and see. And also by the way Alvaro Pereira has made a miracle recovery, he's about to come on forward back on again for Uruguay. As Ross Barkley waits to come on we've played 70 minutes of the second half, Uruguay won, England 0, Uruguay have had the chances to finish the game off, another really poor pass though by England, by Leighton Baines the left back towards Rooney and Joe Hart comes considerably out of his penalty area to find Gary Cahill. England have had nothing like the composure that they showed against Italy in the opening game when they kept possession well, they've given it away far too many times, it's been far too frantic in the first half and now the ball is played well to Baines. Henderson's having a decent game for England, Baines now onto Welbeck, Rooney's in the area with Sturridge, Welbeck needs to deliver something here, Gerrard he's got Johnson available down the right, now England need a good cross from Johnson and it goes and the defender managed to just scrape it away and then Alvaro Pereira got his head on the ball and then comes in and there's a little bit of retribution from him I think, he obviously felt, I mean to be honest it looked active then Sturley, he's played the ball, Sturley was accidental, he's played the ball here but what Uruguay's doing now, what they shouldn't do is drop in off and let England have the play and get it weighed and just needs one good cross in the box. Well Campaines provide it for England, he hasn't got it in short, he plays it to Sturridge with Ross Barkley ready to come on, Sturridge was he doing, he's just knocked it straight long into the goalkeeper's hands, 18 and a half minutes gone in the second half here in Sao Paulo, Ross Barkley waits patiently to come on for England, they trail to Luis Suarez's goal, scored after 38 minutes, Gerrard losing the ball on the halfway line, Cavani's ball over and then now Suarez backing into Gary Cahill and it's a free kick to England. Uruguay at least, the one crumb of comfort I can offer you listening to us is that Uruguay seem to be sitting back a bit here and maybe they're going to settle for the one nilly that they have. Anyway Barkley now does come on for Sterling and Barkley's going to play right. At the moment he's playing on the right hand side and the ball is into the feet of Welbeck, 19 minutes gone in the second half, Baines now on to Sturridge, can Sturridge go away from the defender here, Sturridge in the area and then Paul Ball into the near post should have given Rooney something there, again straight at goalkeeper Mozlera. Yeah looking for a little bit of quality, Darryl Sturridge another one for me who looks like he's felt the pace here, a decent first half but he's come right off, he looks very leggy as well now. There's a few tailed plays for him, I've got to say but Uruguay have really come off the pace and how long is it before they try and freshen up? How long will Suarez last before 4-lan comes on? Well I have to say watching Raheem Sterling in training after that game against Italy, he did seem to show quite a lot of stiffness, wasn't moving around too well, we wonder whether he fit enough to start this game tonight. Barkley now is on for Sterling and we played nearly 20 minutes at the second half and England effectively are going out of the World Cup unless they can save this game, they're trailing 1-0, at least they're getting plenty of the ball but can they do something with it? Baines now should have linked with Sturridge over on the far side, still Baines persevering. But a lot of the action at the moment is coming down on England left hand side, Uruguay clear and they managed to get themselves a throw in as well, off one of the England players. Don't forget 0-500-909-693, your thoughts on 5-Live and let's hope still with 25 minutes to go that they're not going to be 100% negative thoughts, that England can get something from this game. Ball out of play again over on the far side. Uruguay, well with 25 minutes to go it could be a dangerous game but they're going to play here, they're going to sit back leaving Suarez downfield. England the fans from England away to our right are doing there a little bit to try and help. It's Jagi Elker on the ball for England, he doesn't need to launch this and lose it. England need to keep the ball, the ball is played into Barclay for the first time, Barclay turning and immediately there were two Uruguayans with him, Rooney working hard now for England. Rooney's won the ball, takes some doing against Arevalo, Johnson needs to put a cross in here. The ball is with Rooney, Rooney backflicked to Barclay, oh Barclay almost found himself an opening inside the Uruguayan area and I think Adam Lallana may be coming on soon for England I can see him down there getting some words from Gary Neville. So 21 and a half minutes gone in the second half, a Uruguayan change now. Lodero who's been playing in midfield this evening is going to come off and he'll be replaced by Christian Stoani who played in the first game and don't forget by the way Uruguay lost 3-1 to Costa Rica but they've been the better team this evening so far against England. So Stoani comes on, wide player, England have a throw in and they've got another one, another five yards down the line, Johnson takes it on to Barclay. Barclay has three Uruguayan players immediately surrounding him, very very tight. Gerard was late there and the England captain showing a bit of frustration. We'll get a yellow card from the Spanish referee for that. It's the halfway point of the second half, it's threatening to be a very very disappointing night for England. Let's hope Alan Green can save the day. Well this World Cup has seen an avalanche of goals. This is my third game, I've only managed to describe two of them, both of them against England. Balotelli and Suarez, I've got to find personally at least one England goal in the remaining 22 minutes of this match. Bringing Barclay on, totally approve of that but is he best in a wide position? Surely he's going to be through the middle. Well it goes back to the old saying, is it really can you produce something from the right side? No, you probably think not, it's a bit early into him so again bringing somebody on for the width, you bring somebody who plays there. Here's Suarez, Suarez crosses high in the direction of Cavani, actually it was an attempt on goal from Suarez. He wouldn't put a pass to him. It was behind the crossbar, goal kick to England, less than 22 minutes left for play. You're listening to Brazil 2014 World Cup Station, five line. England trail Uruguay, there is still hope but you think England have got to get a draw out of this game. Here is Barclay, off-riding down the right side, certainly not his strongest position. To Johnson, Barclay wants more, Rooney's available, Barclay's running towards Rooney, running away from Rooney, still has the ball. He's got banged on the far side of the field, nice with Jordan Henderson down, Henderson into Rooney in a central position. Rooney could have equalised for England, crosses to the right to Johnson, Johnson approaching the penalty here, into the penalty here. But he immediately lost control of the ball and has smacked off field for Uruguay, Suarez gives up the chase quite early on because the ball was running through to Cahill. Bring in Danny Mills in just a moment, here's Jordan Henderson, the Sturridge, Henderson again, goodness that was a short pass from Sturridge. Sturridge looking to get the ball back, Glenn Johnson is crouching at the moment, has he picked up a problem? Oh, Barclay, a fade in that rash challenge, Binge crosses into the penalty here and it's cleared by the youngster Jimenez away to the far side of the field. I think Glenn Johnson's got a problem, he's hobbling on the near side and of course the ball is playing to Johnson. Johnson inside right channel for England on the Sturridge, level with the edge of the Uruguayan penalty here, moves in field, dives over, didn't get the free kick, wasn't merited and has cleared up to Suarez and Suarez holds off Cahill, then Cahill pushes him in the back and it's a Uruguay free kick and that is naive from Cahill. Well, LaLana's coming on now as well, isn't it? Yep. Danny, sorry, I meant to bring you in earlier. No, just as LaLana comes on, I'd like to see a change in formation. I think you should go with Ruli and Sturridge up top, I'd play Barclay in behind him, I'd play Jordan Henderson slightly on the left side of the field, I'd play LaLana maybe on the right, or you can switch those two round and Stephen Jarrod in that holding role. At the moment, yeah, England are attacking Uruguay, a drop in deeper and deeper and deeper, but there's still no real set pattern to England's play, they've got to try something different. Pereira takes a free kick, LaLana's come on, he's replaced Welbeck and I think there is a change in formation, certainly Barclay's gone into a central position, LaLana's also quite central, Henderson has pushed slightly towards the right side, England trail Uruguay 1-0 and we've only got 19 minutes left for play, cross-end of the England penalty here, headed away by Cahill and smacked up field by Jagielga, then there's a collision between Ruli and Arabalo and their referees decided it was a foul by Ruli, I heard Mike's comment at the start of the second half, he was absolutely right, Arabalo has been outstanding for Uruguay. I think Uruguay have played well as a team, we can single out certain players for what they do, but as a team they've worked hard, they've got the rewards, they probably should have killed the game the first 15 minutes. Certainly Kavanig should have scored, Suarez also had a chance, Suarez takes this free kick, a gold score for Uruguay, plays in an accurately towards Gaudin but it's caught well by Joe Hart, Gaudin rushes back, the ball goes beyond him, the throw by Hart to Johnson, Johnson smacks it away towards the far side, towards Sturridge, great control by Daniel Sturridge, first touch control and a flick to the left side to Baines, Baines doesn't need to cross over, there's nobody inside the penalty area for England, Sturridge is there and I, it's being worked on the far side by LaLana and Baines, but they didn't get what they wanted, they think the throw should be theirs, it's not, it goes to Uruguay. Well again we had opportunities there to put the ball in the box a couple of times and they're good areas, you know final third of the pitch and we check out and check out again. Uruguay won, England now, they have backed off Uruguay, still making the better team and there's always a threat, they'll get a break away, either for Kavanig or Suarez, either of them could finish off England on the night, England will not be definitely out if they lose this game, not mathematically, but their chances of getting through will depend on Italy winning all three games on England beating Costa Rica and then the gold difference falling to England, that's going to be asking a lot, the ball hit towards Suarez, not a great header away by Kavanig, goodness gracious he's looking to feed that in the direction of a white shirt and now it's over the halfway line with Barclay, Barclay's pass forcing Sturridge wide, Sturridge keeps it in play, again Sturridge is done well, then he's tackled, he's fouled by Godin and it's a free kick to England, Ironic cheers from the England fans, 17 minutes to go here on five line, Uruguay lead one down, Henderson tap the free kick to Johnson, on it goes to Sturridge, Sturridge's turn, Sturridge shoots, straight at the goalkeeper, it was a really good hit, easy save. Good play though wasn't it, Uruguay made the space for himself, a couple of turns here and there, left and right dropping his shoulder, but he just scuffs the effort at goal, he's trying to place it. What England have done now is that Gerard is sitting in front of the back four, then three ahead of him, Lallana, oh goodness and the ball breaks towards Suarez, Cale, the birth to danger, we've got Henderson, Barclay and Lallana as a three behind Rooney and Sturridge. They're trying to balance off when they lose the ball, Rooney's on the left at the minute and I think he's telling Barclay to come up here, look Rooney wants to get back in the middle, he's saying to Barclay you come out here, I'm not going out there, you, look they're talking about. Do you know something, I think Barclay just said this is where the coach wants me to play, so Rooney staying left, meantime, Uruguay have got to throw in and it's, oh goodness gracious, that was thrown to Suarez, he appealed for handball, there may have been, just over a quarter of an hour to go, England must score, here's Gerard, on to Johnson. Still inside his own half, tap to Henderson over the half way line, to Sturridge, Sturridge does brilliantly, Sturridge evades two players, feeds it on to Glenn Johnson, Johnson moves into the penalty area, Johnson feeds it, Rooney equalises, England have equalised, great work for the Liverpool player, Sturridge, Johnson into the penalty area and the low cross and finally weighing Rooney scores in a World Cup final, the level, Uruguay won, England won. Well they're being very positive with the substitutions and it's played off, Uruguay have gone deeper and deeper, gives Sturridge credit to start with, wonderful bit of play on the right hand side on the wing, gets the space, rolls Johnson, his first touch is immaculate inside, pushes it past him into the box, he's driving across and he just gets it there just before the defender, and Rooney's the one who reacts at a far post as it comes across, it's a simple tap in with his left foot. In Dennis is on the touch line. Beer, beer behind the goal, sprayed into the air as the England fans celebrate and Wayne Rooney moves level with Michael Owen with his 40th goal for his country and the England supporters out and believe they've left it late as Roy Hodgson just leapt off the bench and celebrate him with arms aloft. 14 minutes lads, still time for a winner, you haven't played well, we'll forget about the previous 76 minutes, just aim for a second goal. Thank goodness I didn't go a World Cup without an England goal. 1-1 here in Sao Paulo, Rooney the goal scorer, to La Lanna, La Lanna first forward, ball comes off a Euro-Quant player, out burn England throwing, Rooney leaves it for Baines to take, the momentum nine, must be with England. Definitely the changes of work, the fresh and the team up, they're all leggy, there's no doubt about that, the introduction of Barclay and La Lanna, they're just pushing on more, passing the ball better. Great ball from Rooney to Johnson, Johnson who delivered the ball from Rooney to equalise. Back it goes to Henderson, Henderson chipping it towards La Lanna, La Lanna heads it off, ball headed on to Sturridge, Sturridge goes down, not a penalty kick though. No, no, no referee got that right. 13 minutes to go, as far as he's still on the pitch, I think he's lasted longer than anybody could have imagined, though he might be taken off soon, meantime England attack, Baines in the Sturridge and the penalty here, Jerry Schitt saved by the goalkeeper, Goslarra. They're struggling now, EuroQuant. EuroQuant have come off the place, they've worked very, very hard for an hour, probably 17 minutes, and now they're feeling the pace, and England really are all over them. Right, the man who's coming on is Fertile, can't see who's coming off yet, the board hasn't gone up, oh it's Gonzalez. What's the time say? 12 and a bit minutes, plus added time. The mood has transformed as far as England are concerned with that Rooney equaliser. 1-1, EuroQuant England, EuroQuant still trying to make the substitution. Finally, Puccini gets his opportunity and Gonzalez comes off, and Puccini goes into the defence. Yep, they've pushed out, pushed Pereira into midfield, but it's an offensive move this. Yeah, definitely, no doubt about that, they know they're getting overrun at the minute with England all the attackers on, they've got EuroQuant, put an extra defender on, they'll take the point. But it's not guaranteed as it's chip forward into the England penalty area, clattered clear high by Jagielka, headed back, Suarez takes it on his chest, Suarez tried to run into the box, it's cleared by England, only to the excellent Aravallo, Aravallo to Cavani, edge of the D, still with Uruguay, down the far side, crossed into Cavani, ball bounces and it's cleared on the half-bolly by Jordan Henderson, and that's not collected by Caceras, England counterattack here, Rooney in the far side, Barclay screaming down the left, Rooney plays it to Ross Barclay, he tried to backheal the return pass, didn't come off, Uruguay managed to clear it off field, 11 minutes to go on five line. At the end of the Italy game, everybody was in a mood of depression, let's say. I always thought a draw against Uruguay and a win against Costa Rica will be enough for England. The moment we're getting that draw, we might yet get the win. 11 minutes to go, Surridge almost fouled, wasn't a great deal in that for Chile, the guilty offender, and it's a free kick to England, down this near side of the field, Johnson's going to tap it short for Henderson, Henderson now, over the halfway line, Johnson, Henderson again, and back to Cahill, it's moving towards the left side, towards Baines, Baines, back to Jagie Elkin. England mustn't just settle for the draw, there is a chance to win this game, and Uruguay would then have no points from two games. This mood has transformed, Johnson with a throw in, but the referee decided that Johnson had claimed far too much room there, so he's given the throw the other way now to Uruguay. Rightly so, he must have pinched 15-20 yards there going Johnson, but England just gradually coming off the pace to get a little more shape now, because they've got the equaliser, I think, from the bench, they've sort of tried to push players into positions to make sure they don't lose a second. For Cahill with a throw, chested back by Suarez to Cavani, and Cavani, lovely ball to the far side, and Casarys, look at the run the full back has, he crosses very deep towards the far post, Cahill on the way, what's going on behind him, heads it behind for a corner. Well it's that left hand side isn't it, Baines is on his own again, I think it's a ruin, he was being taught to play there, but he let the full back come out far too easy. Suarez somehow is lasting the pace, 81 minutes played here in Sao Paulo, Argentina corner, Uruguay corner from the left, Suarez plays it right footed in towards the near post, cleared by England, cleared by Barclay, and then it's forward to Suarez again, Suarez crosses low, headed behind by Cahill for another corner. Barclay there defensively, Cavani is waiting, wonderful run by Suarez, but you've got to say Barclay took his eye off the ball, he should have cut the lane off. Nine minutes to go, 1-1, Suarez plays it in firmly, headed away by England again, and played out by Pereira to lose Suarez again, Suarez back to Pereira, 25 yards of goal, crosses towards the far post, headed clear, off the mid-drift of Casarys, beats it, Suarez is slipping in to the fender, and he crosses low and it's cleared by Jordan Henderson, Casarys again on the far side of the field, chess it down, nods out of play, off the Uruguay foot, and it's a throw into England. Eight minutes, eight minutes plus out of time remaining, don't you dare switch off to five-live, Uruguay won, England won, England throwing, back to Jagie Elke, just a little left of the England penalty area, England have slowed the pace somewhat, driven now towards Sturridge, Sturridge clicks it home with his head, Rooney chases after it, was lair out of his penalty area, to clear it up field, and the header reaches Uruguayan and goes on to Suarez, Suarez crosses into the penalty area, K-Hill clicks it in the air, another down-foot header, goodness gracious that might have been a handball by La La La, but England survived that little scare, and K-Hill should clear, and K-Hill clears it out, off the near touch line, he must come off that Uruguayan boot, of Pussele's boot, and it's going to be a throw in to England, which Henderson will take. What's your gut telling you Chris? I think England, I've got to say I think England's come off the pace, I think they're quite happy to see it at the point as well, Uruguay are chasing it because England's come off the pace, but I think both teams are quite happy, nobody wants to give anything away now. Defeat is almost unbearable for either of these former world champions, Uruguay twice England once, here's Gerard, the skipper for England, moving towards the half-way line, crossing it, slipped the ball in field to La La La, Baines is further down that left side, Gerard driving the ball towards Jordan Henderson, a mistake by the defender, Henderson's got the ball, few yards outside the penalty, crosses right foot in, towards Derrige, comes from there and makes the catch. Yeah, Jordan Henderson's played quite well actually, he's used the ball pretty well, he's playing the sort of right-hand side at the minute, something like a daemon really. He's played that quite a lot for Liverpool. Yeah, he's like a daemon to play in at the minute, but... But long ball forward, Suarez is onside into the penalty here, Suarez makes it 2-1, lashing the ball past Johan, and that could be the death knell for England. Louis Suarez, only three-quarters fit, scores his second goal in the game, just as England had believed the pressure on themselves and suddenly was six minutes to go, Uruguay two, England one. Well, it's not my Suarez again, but I've got to say, what a bad, bad goal that is. You talk about Sunday morning football, that is, honestly, that is atrocious. A long ball, a flick on, everybody falls asleep, and I'm not saying anything away from the finish, it's absolutely brilliant, it's usual, what you see from them. But it's just a clearance, a flick on, nobody reacts, apart from Louis Suarez, one touch back of the net. That is Sunday morning defending that by the way. But it is, again, world-class finishing. Ian Dennis is on the touchline. The goal happened at the other end, at this end, Maslera, decked out in luminous orange, slumped to his knees to celebrate, facing the England fans, who are very, very silent, and England are going to make a change, Alan, looks like, is it Ricky Lambert, you might have a better view from where you are, but are you going to make a change? Yes, Ricky Lambert's going to come on. And the question is, who's coming off? Well, we haven't seen the fourth official yet. What is going on? The fourth official gone for a loop break? Here he comes now, twiddling your numbers, playing has resumed. Uruguay 2, England 1, Rooney having equalised for England, rushes forward, surrounded by Uruguay defenders, and he's fouled by one of them, and it's a free kick to England, just to the left of the penalty area. Well, it's a positive run by Wayne Rooney from the kickoff, isn't it? There's four round him, and it is a little bit late on him, and this is a very, very good position, by the way, as if Stephen Scherrer was going to whip this in, and it's an excellent position for England. Well, they want to get Lambert on now, Lambert's good in the air, he's going to replace Jordan Henderson. Henderson doesn't know it yet, but finally he's being told by a colleague, so Henderson has to rush off. Four minutes to go. Ricky Lambert, the new Liverpool player, replaces another one, and another change coming up for Uruguay, finally Suarez is coming off, and it's Sebastian Cuáces is coming on. Liverpool, for Liverpool again. I can tell you what, being time, somebody's dying for injured, but I think Suarez has got cramp. That's what it is. Ian Dennis. You would have remembered Alan in the Italy game, where two Italian players were giving treatment to, I think it was to Daniel's storage because of cramp. It's on his left leg, which is where he had that surgery on his left knee, but it was only cramp, as you said. It was Glenn Johnson, his Liverpool teammates, who were bending back the toes to help ease that cramp. Suarez comes off in a stretcher, but it's only cramp, and Sebastian Cuáces played for Liverpool, sometime in the past. He's on there to supplement the back for Uruguay. Gerard to take the free kick, a couple of yards to the left of the penalty area, the Uruguayan penalty area. Gerard's going to whip this in right-footed. We've got two and a half minutes of normal time remaining. England trailing 2-1. England leave only Leighton Baines back to defend the Uruguayan breakaway. Here's Gerard's free kick into the near post, headed up and away by Uruguay. Suarez beat it just outside the penalty area, crosses deep, Musslera comes and catches. And now they can counterattack here. Musslera throws the ball out. Cavani's round through the middle. His colleagues on the far side, delays the pass into Cavani. Nard goes in the direction of Cavani, into the penalty area. Cavani just about prevents it going behind for a goal kick. He now runs it into the corner, and he'll keep it there. And look who's back hustling him. Suarez is there. Johnson is there, and Johnson, the ball's out of play. It's a throw-in, and a throw-in surely to Uruguay. Here's a decent delivery, but they've got three and a half staying at the back of the mid-air. Three sitting in front, six. They're just going to run the clock down. You've got to say, in these two games, we're seeing Italy and Uruguay. England just get... It's like when you play, you used to get called about, you've got old men, beat you. Because they know the game, they know it a winner game. Italy knew it a winner game. They know how to slow it down, they know how to quicken it up. And Uruguay have done it today. Uruguay have wasted that throw, and it's a goal kick to England, taking short by Hart to Gerard. And Gerard finds Rooney, just short of the half, where he line. Johnson running to his right. Rooney keeps the ball for the moment. Rooney, right in the centre circle, heads it forward towards Rikki Lambert. Lambert heads it down, but not before pushing the defender. It's a free kick to Uruguay, and guess how long they'll take before they actually smack the ball forward. We're inside the last minute of the regular 90. We've had six substitutions, so strictly speaking we should have at least three minutes, plus one or two added minutes for Tyne taking... They've taken players to recover from injury. Minimum five minutes, surely, of added time. Well, it should be longer, if I'm honest, but they'll not. You know what these are late officials are. I think you'll do well to see five minutes. I think it'll be four. These are precious minutes for England. I repeat, mathematically losing here does not mean the road of the World Cup, but there is good as, given the scenario that remains. Mouslera takes the free kick, finally, headed all on the far side of the field. Kavanagh is now in the central attacking position, now that Suarez is going off. Suarez has done his job, putting Uruguay in front, then Rooney equalising for England, and Suarez responds with his second goal. Here's Aravallo heading it forward, five minutes of added time. Gerard, we're into the added time. To Rooney. Rooney. Oh, that foot looked high from Aravallo. Referee played the advantage, good refereeing. Naila Lana, swing the ball in low. Sturridge almost controlled it inside the penalty area, but it's taken away and run clear on the far side of the field by Kassarys. Kassarys' pass wasn't great. Gerard crosses deep for the far post, overhits the ball, Gerard, and it's behind. Lumberjad can't do anything about that. It's a goal kick to Uruguay. Stephen Gerard, who you want really on the ball in that position as well to deliver a bit of quality, but you've got to say the two games Stephen Gerard to me, he hasn't looked 100% fit, sharp, he's not dictated the games. You've got to say, Peerle over there, game, and you've got to say the little guy in midfield for Uruguay, he's bossed up midfield tonight. Suarez on the bench, I can hardly look. He knows he's done everything humanly possible to make sure that Uruguay beat England and almost consigned England to elimination from the World Cup of the Group stage. Mozlera takes the goal kick, headed back by Keahan, and now Gerard heads it down to Baines. We've got four minutes, we have to find a second England goal. Sturridge to the left side. Lumberjad has an awkward pass for Lumberjad to take, he couldn't keep it in play and it'll be a throw in to Uruguay. They're counting down the seconds, never mind the minutes. Not rushing about anything. You can't blame them. Roy Hudson looks disconsolate. It's not a smile on the face of Oscar Taberez either, but his team having lost their opening game to Costa Rica and who would have forecast that are coming back to beat England. Three minutes of added time remaining. Jaguielca hits it full. Lumberjad hustles two defenders into a mistake. England have the ball inside the centre circle. And now it's fed by Jaguielca to the right side and Johnson into Rooney. Rooney tackle, lost the ball initially, but it's collected again. And now it's with Lallana, 30 yards out, onto Baines in the far side. Baines cuts in field, declines the cross, slips it in to Barclay. Gerard shoots, it swings but it's wide. Goal kick again. Well again, rushed the play, no composure anywhere in that build-up. Gerard's under pressure as it comes towards a bad loose pass over here. As the shot goes well weighed. We've got to say, Alan, if it stays like this, Uruguay have been a better team. Yes they have. No doubt about that. We haven't delivered again and I thought South Africa was miserable. So, Suarez just embracing a goalie. He's smiling, but I also think he's hiding his face from the action. And he hardly bird to look at, Suarez. Goal kick, finally taken by Mislerra. Two minutes of added time remaining. Johnson comes forward for England. A Kevani fold him, Johnson did well though. Brilliantly found the target in the far side of the field. Oh, England just run that into trouble. And it's hit the clearance to the halfway line to Baines. She may as well get Baines and Johnson and Cahill forward now. Baines crossing the ball towards the penalty. Took a reflection, knock back. Gerard's there. Gerard was hoping for a foul, didn't get the foul. No Uruguay can counterattack here. Kevani. Kevani, oh, spins away easily from Glenn Johnson. Kevani plays it down the left side. For Chile is after it. And that was an important challenge by Jaguilke. Jaguilke gets the ball back to goalkeeper Joe Hart. Hart wants to come forward himself now, but he leaves it to Baines. Look where Hart is. He's running midway inside the England half. Baines over the halfway line. A high ball towards Lambert. Root one stop, headed down and away. Rooney collects, yard outside the penalty. Rooney checks, crosses low, hits an offender, rebounds corner. The try and push, Kevani is in centre for Lambert. Joe Hart's gone forward as well. Joe Hart inside the penalty area. Rooney's going to take the corner. 40 seconds of added time remaining. Rooney plays it in deep. Hart is there. Comes off another European head. No, it's not as an English head. And it's a goal kick. Yeah, it's a goal kick. No doubt about that. That should be that, you know. Jaguilke, oh, headed it and it's gone out. They're running to get the ball because, as you say, they're not going to rush. They're running to the spot. Exactly, listen. Any advantage you can get, you'll take. It's a question of whether or not the referee adds on a little bit more time. Meantime, the Uruguayan bench is all out of the dugout. They're waiting to surge onto the field. We've had the five minutes that have been allocated for added time. Mousleris still hasn't taken the goal kick. There it goes. There is the final whistle. And Uruguay effectively have put England out of the World Cup. Luis Suarez is the hero. He's held the loft on a colleague's arms. And who can blame them? Suarez is the difference. Suarez is world class. Well, I've got to say Uruguay thought he deserved the win. England had a little spell, second half, when they made the substitutions, creating a few chances. But overall, I don't think there's any arguments. England have come to this tournament with a, you know, a youngest inexperienced side, and it's showed in the two games. They've been beaten by experience, know-how to win a football match. And yes, Bar and Miracle will be going home. But you've got to say, on both games, we've been second best. The miracle required is this. Italy have got to win all three games. England have got to beat Costa Rica, and they've got to beat Costa Rica by a margin that will mean we would go through on goal difference. It's unlikely. It's very slim that possibility. It still exists, but this is a big night for Uruguay. And Suarez just embraces Stephen Gerrard, club colleagues. Gerrard knows the difference tonight. It's Luis Suarez. And the lines are open. I'm sure. Plenty of you wanted to talk to Mark Chapman and Danny Murphy in about ten minutes time. 0500 909 6938 5058 on the text. At BBC Five Live on social media. The sense of crushing disappointment, Danny Mills. I didn't think that anything could be worse than South Africa. But in some ways this is, isn't it? Because England have been so naive defensively. Sadly, it's not been good enough. You know, just the little notes that I've made watching the game. Same old things we talked about. I know when Chris ran to before about in South Africa. Lack of composure under pressure. The inability to keep the ball when players are putting pressure on you. People not really wanting it. Not accepting the ball when they are marked. Also, you have to say, we talked about it before the game, but third none as well, defensively not been good enough. The first game caught out from a short corner when Marquisio scored. The second one, Layton Baines dived in. And then obviously, Kandreva picked the ball for the far post. But I tell you, pulled off Cahill. You know, not quite sure where he was. Second game, almost exactly the same thing. Johnson doesn't get tired enough to the cross. And obviously, Suarez pulls off the back of Jaguilca. And then the second goal was shocking. Yes, it was a flick on from Stephen Jarad. Nothing he could do about that. Got caught underneath the ball a little bit. But then the three players in Baines, Jaguilca and Cahill, were all over the shop. There was no defensive shape or organisation at all. Lewis Suarez, and who can blame him celebrating in front of the Ukrainian supporters? He can only be 75% fit at most. But he scored the two goals. And England, as Alan says, they're not definitely out of the World Cup. Let's just, what did I say, in front of the Uruguayan supporters? Ukraine. Oh, did I? No. Even what? I wish you were Ukrainian. In front of the Uruguayan supporters. When you turn around at Chris, what's looking at you, oddly, you know you put your foot in it. The winning Uruguay goal, that Sunday morning, as you said, of all the goals, a lot down the field and a flick on. But all the goals really concede. I've got a Sunday morning team, and I'd be absolutely devastated if they did that. Listen, you react, the first thing is you anticipate, Stephen Jarad flicks it on or whatever, you think he's not going to win this header. So you cover, who is the only player who reacted on the field? Lewis Suarez, 75%, 70% fit, I'd say, and he was still causing trouble. Two goals again from him. Listen, that defence needs work, and I don't know if they're good enough, and that is the problem. It's already the same work. Let's tuck in, let's do this, let's do that. I don't think we're good enough, it's as simple as that. And we go back to the runs, whatever you want to say. We cannot look after the ball, when Uruguay pressed us today for an hour, we were absolutely awful because we are petrified to control the ball and say, give me the ball, I'll have the ball. Uruguay players wanted it in any area. We love it. The teams just seem to know how to win matches, and we don't. So, Chris, four years on from your memorable rant in Blumfontein, I can remember exactly where we were in one of the most extraordinary houses that any of us have ever stayed in, surrounded by very strange art. Actually, nothing has changed, has it? I'm not asking you to reprise that rant, but nothing actually has changed. Nothing's really got any better, has it? No, it's a wall for that rant. Listen, what you've got to look at is, players not comfortable on the ball. We've always said, from the back onwards, right? But we just... I don't know what it is, but we seem to have a fear factor of enjoying the football. Yes, there's effort. We've always got commitment. We'll always be dangerous to set pieces, and we'll always have the odd moment, which we did second off. But overall, the two games, when are we ever really... People say, this is a young side, these are new players, this is art, this is art. Two years' time, we'll be saying the same thing again, because it's never seemed to change. Just going to reiterate what's going on with the group. Costa Rica and Italy, three points each. They played tomorrow, and they've only played once, of course, so far. England, no points, Uruguay, three points. England need Italy to win all their games, really, and then beat Costa Rica and beat them by a margin, which would mean that they're better than Costa Rica and Uruguay when it comes to the goal difference. We're clutching at straws here. We are, because the problem in that is, if Italy beat Costa Rica, they're through. And then that last game, Uruguay, Italy... Yes, we hear what you're saying. Let's take a draw. Well, if I be honest, Italy will not put out their full strength side. They will probably make nine, ten changes in that game, and say, you know what, we'll save ourselves now for the knockout stages. And Uruguay could well bank on the fact that actually, Costa Rica aren't going to beat England, so probably if they get a draw from Italy, Uruguay will probably think we'll go through. Uruguay has the second team to Italy. Listen, you can rate it now, can't you? Italy are less than everybody. They're through, six point, one in the group. Longest of won the group there, because a look at the draw. But realistically, you've got to say now, it will be an amine miracle if England gets through. Well, 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, 8-5, 0-5-8 on the text, and that BBC Five Live on social media. England found out so badly defensively. I mean, is this worse than four years ago? I have a horrible feeling it is. Well, I think there was almost, you know, not the excuse, but obviously, Frank Lampard's lack of goal obviously went over the line. It was a bit of a turning point, and then, OK, they could pitch that off that, but that was a very strong German side. This was a pretty much the average Uruguay side. OK, yes, Suarez-Covani, great up front, but apart from that, Aravallo probably ran the game in midfield. It bost it. I'll tell you what, they did well, Uruguay. They made changes, they made five changes, they freshened it up. They knew they were playing England who would play high-tempo football. They had a good chance to shoot at England, right? So they've changed it, they've put energy in. They brought Suarez in as a presence, and he always said he'd be for this game. We all knew he'd play in this game, yet we still don't react. We still, again, a little bit of pressure. If you were playing England, you would say, go and press him. Go and press him, go and press him back forward, go and press him. They'll give you the ball back, they will give you the ball back, and it's proved again today. There's no sense of calm or rhythm about England's play, is it? It's all extremely frantic, it's all percentage, you're all wondering how long and good they're going to be able to keep the ball four before they lose it. Is that fair? Oh, definitely. They haven't controlled either game in any real spell. When they were doing well in this game, it was a bit like an FA Cup game, where it was like, you know what, we need to score. So let's just throw everybody forward. There's no real pattern to play, no real idea. It's just like, just keep going forward, keep going forward. And because there was that lack of concentration in the defence, it was four on one at the back, the flick on from Gerard, defence all over the shot. We've just seen it again, it's punted up the field by Muslera, Gerard jumps for it, whether he flicks it or not is immaterial, because actually, Cahill, as you say, instead of all being in a line, correct me if I'm wrong, you all want to be in a line, defensively, clearly from that sort of situation. The moment's thinking of Gerard goes to head that ball, the other, all the players should drop off. Jaguielke gets caught in no-man's-land, Suarez runs in behind him, and then Cahill, he was too deep. And suddenly then, Luis Suarez, you have to say, was an unbelievable finish. Not once did he look at the goal. He had his head down to exactly what he was going to do, smashed it into the back. But it did come off Gerard, otherwise he would have been offside Suarez, actually, but the fact it came off Gerard, plays Suarez onside. Yes, totally. It's not the point on that mark, at this level of football. The point is the line, isn't it? Yeah, put that particular goal, the point is the defensive line. Look what you're saying, there's two, we want one unigrain player, two players. So one say, listen, we've got back in the game, we're not on its way, get Tatum, or block him off. They don't want to do it, the ball, watch the ball, gives it, and he reacts, Luis Suarez, who, let's be honest, couldn't sprint at all today, could not sprint, his foot was always great when he played it into him, but every time he had to chase anything, he didn't have the legs. It's another unbelievably disappointing night, if you're an England supporter with England on the verge of being out of the World Cup, less than a week after they first played.
